      <h1>Sadio Mane salvages last-gasp victory for Liverpool against valiant Villa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:20:36+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane rescued Liverpool as the Reds’ late show at Aston Villa maintained their title charge.</p>
      <p>The forward’s stoppage-time header earned a thrilling 2-1 win just as Jurgen Klopp’s side looked like losing their unbeaten Premier League record.</p>
      <p>Andrew Robertson had equalised with just three minutes left to cancel out Trezeguet’s first-half opener for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Klopp saw his unbeaten side maintain their six-point lead at the top after Manchester City’s 2-1 comeback win over Southampton.</p>
      <p>The top two face off at Anfield next Sunday after they both narrowly avoided upsets on Saturday.</p>
      <p>VAR had earlier created more controversy when Roberto Firmino’s first-half strike was ruled offside, forcing the Premier League to clarify the decision at half-time.</p>

      <p>Liverpool’s last visit to Villa Park saw them thump Villa 6-0 with the hosts waving the white flag en route to an embarrassing relegation three years ago.</p>
      <p>But they faced a different, resurgent Villa this time, underlined by the way Anwar El Ghazi bundled his way through to fire at Alisson Becker after 31 seconds.</p>

      <p>The hosts pressed and hassled Liverpool in the first half but the visitors, who had been subdued, should have opened the scoring after 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Reds had barely threatened yet carved out the best early chance when, from Jordan Henderson’s lobbed cross, a stretching Mane headed wide from six yards.</p>
      <p>A minute later Tom Heaton pushed away Mohamed Salah’s angled volley, only for Villa to take the lead after 21 minutes.</p>
      <p>Mane brought down John McGinn and the midfielder’s delicious free-kick caught Liverpool cold to allow Trezeguet to volley in at the far post.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold’s shot deflected over in response before Liverpool looked to have levelled just before the half hour.</p>
      <p>Mane’s cross was tapped in by Firmino but he was flagged offside – and although VAR replays suggested the Brazilian was onside the decision stood.</p>
      <p>At the break the Premier League stated on Twitter Firmino’s armpit was ahead of Tyrone Mings.</p>
      <p>Salah ballooned over two minutes before half-time as Liverpool tried to raise their game after the interval.</p>
      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum and Mane shot at Heaton but the Reds’ attack struggled to find the same wavelength.</p>
      <p>Henderson’s poor ball snuffed out a breakaway chance and Salah’s wayward effort showed their lack of cutting edge at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Heaton blocked from Mane at the far post and Salah was withdrawn with Wijnaldum with 25 minutes left.</p>
      <p>Liverpool continued to press and Adam Lallana blew a golden chance to level 18 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s introduction had added extra impetus and his cross found the onrushing Lallana, only for the unmarked midfielder to mishit his shot wide from eight yards.</p>
      <p>Battling Villa refused to buckle, putting their bodies on the line to keep Liverpool at bay – until the 87th minute.</p>

      <p>Mane’s deep cross found the unmarked Robertson and the Scot headed in at the far post from close range.</p>
      <p>Then, in the fourth minute of injury time, Mane glanced in Alexander-Arnold’s corner to win it.</p>
