Michelle Obama: Barack could build presidential library anywhere because 'so many people' feel 'like he is their president'

Former first lady Michelle Obama suggested that former President Barack Obama could build his presidential library anywhere around the world because people in foreign countries feel like he is their president.
Michelle Obama explained at Tuesday's Obama Foundation Summit at the Illinois Institute of Technology that Chicago's Jackson Park was selected as the location for the Obama Presidential Center because it is close to the couple's old home and near her childhood home.
“There’s power in the selection of Jackson Park,” the former first lady said. “Barack and I don’t do things incidentally. There’s a strategy.”



“Barack’s presidential library could have been anywhere in the world because there are so many people who feel like he is their president,” Obama said. “New York wanted it. Hawaii wants it. Because it’s also an economic engine.""
The Barack Obama Presidential Library will be the first fully digital presidential library.
Former President Obama also spoke at the event and made waves for condemning ""wokeness"" and ""cancel culture.""
“This idea of purity, and you’re never compromised, and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly,” the former president said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.”
