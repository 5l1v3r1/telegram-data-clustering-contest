      <p><b>ROMEÂ (AP)</b> - Discriminatory chants prompted a Serie A soccer game between Roma and Napoli to be briefly suspended Saturday.</p>
      <p>Referee Gianluca Rocchi made the decision in the second half after Roma fans aimed anti-territorial chants - which are treated in the same manner as racist chants - at Napoli. The game resumed after a few minutes.</p>
      <p>An Associated Press photographer next to the pitch also heard sporadic racist chants aimed at Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, who is black.</p>
      <p>Rocchi had already ordered an announcement to be made over the Stadio Olimpico's public address system asking fans to stop the chants.</p>
      <p>During the suspension, Rocchi gathered teams in the center circle, then Roma forward Edin Dzeko encouraged fans to applaud rather than jeer the opposition.</p>
      <p>Roma led 2-0 at the time of the suspension before going on to win 2-1.</p>
      <p>Italy's top tier has been marred by several incidents of fan racism this season.</p>
