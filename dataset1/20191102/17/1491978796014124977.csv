Neon dreams: Los Angeles by night – in pictures
02 Nov 2019, 17:00 by Louisa Streeting

Franck Bohbot’s photography series LA Confidential, started in 2018, is a nocturnal exploration that focuses on neon signs. “At night, everything changes,” says the photographer, who is originally from Paris, “and the neon lights help to create the scene… this could be the LA from the past but also from the future.”
