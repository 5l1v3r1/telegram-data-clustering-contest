With Cody Fajardo sidelined by an oblique injury, Isaac Harker will start at quarterback for the Saskatchewan Roughriders on Saturday.
CKRM’s Michael Ball reported the news to open the station’s pre-game show.
Fajardo, the Roughriders’ nominee for the CFL’s most-outstanding-player award, was injured in practice on Wednesday.
Harker, 23, is poised to make his first CFL start. A victory by the home team over the Edmonton Eskimos at Mosaic Stadium will give Saskatchewan first place in the West Division for the first time since 2009. Kickoff is scheduled for 2 p.m.
If the Roughriders lose, they can also finish first if the B.C. Lions defeat the Calgary Stampeders on Saturday night.
