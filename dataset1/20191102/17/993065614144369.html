      <p>The author of Mary Poppins told Dame Julie Andrews that she was “far too pretty” for the role, the actress has revealed.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event at the Southbank Centre to promote her new memoir, Dame Julie described being in hospital following the birth of her daughter and receiving a gruff phone call from Pamela Travers.</p>
      <p>“She said ‘Well talk to me’ and I said ‘I’m sorry I’ve just had a baby yesterday, I’m feeling a bit out of it’,” said Dame Julie.</p>
      <p>“She said ‘I understand you’re going to play Mary Poppins? You’re far too pretty of course, but you’ve got the nose for it’.”</p>
      <blockquote>Singing with that glorious sound around you is almost more wondrous than anything<cite>Dame Julie Andrews</cite></blockquote>
      <p>It is one of hundreds of anecdotes the actress and author has from a career in showbusiness spanning almost 75 years.</p>
      <p>In conversation with actor Alex Jennings – who was recently directed by Dame Julie as Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady – she gave an insight into her path from musicals and vaudeville shows to the silver screen.</p>
      <p>Dame Julie grew up in Walton-on-Thames where her mother was a singer and pianist and her stepfather was a tenor.</p>
      <p>It was her stepfather who gave her singing lessons to keep her occupied when her school was closed during the war.</p>
      <p>“I hated the lessons but they discovered that I had this really freak, child prodigy voice and hit high notes and dogs would howl for miles around,” she said.</p>
      <p>Despite her talent, Dame Julie said at first she had not enjoyed learning to sing, saying: “The realisation that I could give the audience something didn’t come until much later.”</p>
      <p>She revealed it was comedienne Hetty Jaques who helped launch her career in America by advising the producers of Broadway musical The Boyfriend to go and see her in panto.</p>
      <p>She was subsequently offered a two-year contract in New York, which paved her way to Hollywood.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney himself asked her to play Mary Poppins, and she delighted the audience at the Southbank Centre by saying “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” backwards as she does in the film.</p>
      <p>She said one of her most star-struck moments came when Hollywood icon Bette Davis told her at the premiere of The Sound of Music “you, young lady, are going to be a very great star”.</p>
      <p>Dame Julie said: “I just couldn’t believe she would be that generous.”</p>
      <p>Her second memoir is titled Home Work: A memoir of my Hollywood years and is co-written with her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton.</p>
      <p>It covers her time working with the likes of Paul Newman, Gene Kelly, Rock Hudson and Burt Reynolds.</p>

      <p>Despite revelations about his treatment of his leading ladies, Dame Julie has fond memories of working with Alfred Hitchcock, saying he was never inappropriate or bullying.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why, I think I was just lucky,” she said.</p>
      <p>When asked for a few of her “favourite things”, she said: “My kids, my garden, my dogs, my friends, I love all kinds of music, I love art and private time at home.”</p>
      <p>She said her love of her home life was why she picked the title “Home Work” for her book.</p>
      <p>Dame Judy also revealed she has a sign reading “Are we lucky or what?” over the doorway to her kitchen – a mantra she repeats a lot to herself and has always tried to instil into her children.</p>
      <p>When asked which part of her career she would repeat if she could, she replied: “The thing that thrills me beyond anything – is singing with an orchestra, my singing teacher described it as like being lifted up in the most comfortable armchair and being carried along over the top of the music.</p>
      <p>“Singing with that glorious sound around you is almost more wondrous than anything.”</p>
      <p>There’s one challenge she thinks might be beyond even the magic of Mary Poppins – instilling manners into Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>When asked by an audience member if Mary could have managed the US President, she said: “It’s a difficult question, maybe Mary Poppins would have shaped him up – if only we had a chance to try.”</p>
