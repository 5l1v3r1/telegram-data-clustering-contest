Jimenez strikes to increase pressure on Emery
02 Nov 2019, 17:05 by By Press Association








Raul Jimenez was on hand to head home a late leveller for Wolves as Arsenal let a lead slip for the third time in a week to increase pressure on head coach Unai Emery.
The Gunners appeared to have put the issues surrounding Granit Xhaka to one side, the midfielder watching from home after swearing at supporters last week, when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck, but a 1-1 draw here means Emery has overseen a run of two wins from the last nine Premier League games.
The Gabon striker – captain with Xhaka absent – took on the mantle and turned in his 50th Arsenal goal but the hosts were timid in attack and once again failed to keep a clean sheet as Jimenez rose to header in an equaliser with 14 minutes remaining to earn Wolves a deserved share of the spoils.



Emery recalled Mesut Ozil for only his second league appearance of the season but it was not enough to inspire his side to a much-needed victory.
Arsenal were two goals ahead last Sunday before Crystal Palace fought back to leave the Emirates Stadium with a point – and they also held the lead more than once before a 5-5 Carabao Cup draw at Liverpool, who ultimately won the fourth-round tie on penalties.
Wolves started like a side full of confidence but despite plenty of possession they struggled to test Bernd Leno, a tame Joao Moutinho free-kick the closest they came before Arsenal began to assert themselves.
Aubameyang shot straight at Rui Patricio from a tight angle before Lucas Torreira saw his low drive deflected behind for a corner.
Wolves failed to clear their lines and David Luiz broke down the right with his low cross collected by Lacazette and turned on for Aubameyang to side-foot home from 12 yards and put the hosts ahead.

Ruben Neves sent a trademark long-range effort just over Leno’s crossbar as Wolves look to draw level while Arsenal called Patricio into action courtesy of a Lacazette shot.
But Arsenal had Leno to thank for going in ahead at the interval as the Germany international did brilliantly to palm away Matt Doherty’s strike after being picked out free inside the penalty area.
Leno was back in action soon after the restart, diving to keep out Neves’ curling shot while Emery turned to his bench and called on in-form 18-year-old Gabriel Martinelli to replace Lacazette.



Calum Chambers headed a corner goalwards only to see Doherty clear off the line, the Wolves full-back limping off injured soon after.
But it was a tactical call from Emery which appeared to turn the game in favour of the opposition as he opted to replace defensive midfielder Torreira with teenage winger Bukayo Saka.
The change of shape and system seemed to catch Arsenal out and Nuno Espirito Santo’s side took full advantage as Moutinho crossed for Jimenez to get above Chambers and head low past Leno, the atmosphere inside the stadium immediately changing as a result.
Jeers and groans met every wayward pass and supporters headed to the exit en masse before the end of a game which Wolves were more likely to win in the closing stages.

Mario Jordan and the fiat-peugeot merger: according to you when you will have to choose who will dismiss ...

02 Nov 2019, 17:25


THE FCA DOESN'T TAKE ANOTHER - MARIO GIORDANO AND THE FIAT-PEUGEOT MERGER: ""THE SITUATION IS THIS: A FRENCH COMPANY COMES, WITH THE FRENCH STATE, AND A COMPANY A LITTLE DUTCH, A LITTLE ENGLISH, A PO 'AMERICAN, WHICH IS THE FIRST CAR MANUFACTURER IN ITALY. ACCORDING TO YOU, WHEN SHOULD YOU CHOOSE WHICH LICENSE WORKERS, WHO WILL BE GROUND? METZ OR POMIGLIANO? ""



Mario Giordano for ""the Truth""

«Global challenge». ""Total synergy"". ""Something special"". ""Great Alliance"" (with a capital letter). ""Big shot"" (tiny without Smaila). ""Strategic choice"". ""New colossus"". «Challenge to innovation». ""New models in sight"". ""Cars of the future"". ""Development for the Country"". Italian newspapers are pouring champagne the day after the official announcement of the merger between Peugeot and FCA, the former Fiat. Of course, ""Markets celebrate"", ""Piazza Affari brinda"", ""The title flies"". And the heirs of the Agnellis, with their pockets full of sounding diamonds, are immediately transformed into ""King Midas of the Stock Exchange"". ""John Elkann is a phenomenon"", the press of our house excites. The beatification is not long, but the miracle is already there: the multiplication of dividends and fish.

Which fish, as is known, bite that it is a pleasure.
In the midst of this wave of enthusiasm, in fact, some non-insignificant data of the so-called «fusion at par» risk being passed over in silence. The first of which is that it is not a question of a ""fusion at par"", but, in practice, of an acquisition of Fca by Peugeot. The last minute agreement, signed after the failure of the previous FCA attempt with Renault, delivers all the command levers in the hands of the French, starting with the board of directors that will be controlled by them: out of eleven members, in fact, will have five (as five will have the former Fiat), but the eleventh (and therefore the balance needle) do you know who it will be? Obvious: Carlos Tavares, current CEO of Peugeot.

Six to five and voila, the Eiffel Tower will triumph. Clearly, selling was an excellent sale. From this point of view it is true that John Elkann was good: he was literally covered in gold. FCA shares have been paid almost 30 percent more than market value, the shareholders will be distributed an extra dividend of 5.5 billion euros.

The pockets fill up, the shareholders rejoice, the heirs of the Agnellis swell with pennies like never before, and all this is naturally beautiful. For them, of course. But for us? That is: for Italy? Is this really so exciting? Does it really open up a bright future for us? The sol of the economic future? Does it really deserve so much waste of unnatural effervescent bubbles, the popping of sparkling wines, the excess of enthusiasm, the newspaper columns all cream and sugar? I have some doubts. Also because the French State, already a 12.2 percent shareholder in Peugeot, will be a shareholder with a share of approximately 6 percent also in the new company.
So the situation is this: a French company is merged, with the French state in it, it is a stateless company (a little Dutch, a little English, a little American) but in fact it is still the first producer of cars in Italy. The majority of the Board of Directors is of the French.

In your opinion, when important decisions will have to be made (such as: where to place the purchasing department, on which all the activities depend) which city will you choose? Paris or something else? And when you have to choose which plants to shut down and which workers to lay off, who will be crying? Metz (France) or Pomigliano (Italy)?




FCA

Official statements guarantee that no establishment will be closed. But official statements at the time of enthusiasm have always been denied within a few years. And, in any case, no official declaration guarantees the stability of the occupation: of the 400,000 workers who are currently part of the two groups, someone will lose their pens. Otherwise, how is it that the famous ""synergies"" are made? How is it that the (expected) savings are made?

Somewhere it will also be necessary to cut. And it is clear that they will not cut in France.
The hypothesis of an agreement between Peugeot and former Fiat, however, is not new. It had popped up several times over the past few years.
Even Sergio Marchionne had cherished the idea. But then he had set it aside, preferring other solutions precisely because of the excesses of overlaps, for too many ""photocopying establishments"". You will also remember that the previous FCA agreement across the Alps, the one with Renault, had been blown up by the French government precisely because it feared that with the merger there would be jobs at risk in France.

In this case, however, no fear. The French state, which is inside the shareholders, celebrates. So you don't see jobs at risk in France. But, summing up, if between Fca and Peugeot there are photocopy establishments to be closed, or to be heavily reduced, and this will not happen in France, in your opinion, where will it happen? The answer is not difficult. In Italy, putting everything together, they remained the shreds of a dozen former Fiat factories.

Those who work there, obviously, ask for protection. But the difference is that the French state is in the ownership of the new giant. The Italian one, on the other hand, is not there. There is no shareholder of the new giant. But not just there. The Italian State is not really there. On these occasions there is never. When it comes to defending our companies, our assets, our workers, we are champions of inaction. And so, after giving Fiat money for years, our policy looks at the last step in the country's industrial yield with the same catatonic look with which it accompanied the previous steps. Not received.

The only comment of Prime Minister Conte, warned at games made, is that this new company ""will bring economies of scale with savings of the planned investments with particular regard to the development of electric cars"". Of course: cheers hurray. Long live electric cars. Long live economies of scale. And cheers the Agnelli heirs with pockets full of money. We are all happy: the Bags celebrate, the shareholders as well. Workers a little less. But who cares?
