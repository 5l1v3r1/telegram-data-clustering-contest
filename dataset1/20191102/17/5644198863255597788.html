      <p>SEOUL: South Korean rescuers located three bodies believed to be among seven who went missing after their <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/south-korean-helicopter-crash-dokdo-takeshima-islets-12053544">chopper crashed into the sea</a> shortly after taking off from islets disputed with Japan, officials said on Saturday (Nov 2).</p>
      <p>The helicopter had just picked an injured fisherman up from Dokdo, which is known as Takeshima in Japan, when it went down on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>One body was found inside the chopper located at a depth of 72m, 600m south of the islets, while the other two were found in the water nearby, a Coast Guard representative told reporters.</p>
      <p>The crashed chopper - which rescuers located on Friday - sat upside down on the seabed, he said, adding its tail had broken off and had been found 110m away.</p>

      <p>It was not yet possible to identify the three bodies, he said, adding that a search operation was underway to retrieve them and find the other four still missing.</p>
      <p>The bodies were found by an unmanned submarine, although divers would attempt to retrieve them manually for fear using the submarine's "robot-arm" could damage the remains.</p>
      <p>"We will do our best till the end to bring those missing back to their families," he added.</p>
      <p>Ships and divers from the defence ministry and members of the National Fire Agency and civilian volunteers have been mobilised for the search operation, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The crashed chopper is a Eurocopter EC225, made by the European aerospace corporation Airbus.</p>
      <p>The seven people on board were five rescuers, the fisherman and a civilian.</p>
      <p>Seoul has controlled the islets in the Sea of Japan - or East Sea - since 1945, when Tokyo's brutal colonial rule on the peninsula ended, while Japan still claims sovereignty over them.</p>
