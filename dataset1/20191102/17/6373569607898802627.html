      <h1>Plymouth Argyle donate food to the homeless after Home Park match called off</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims had catered for around 9,000 fans for their postponed game against Grimsby Town</h2>

      <p>Uneaten food from Plymouth Argyle’s postponed game against Grimsby Town at Home Park did not go to waste as it was donated to two groups who look after the homeless.</p>
      <p>It was given to the George House Homeless Hostel in Stonehouse and the Salvation Army’s Devonport House.</p>
      <p>The food had either already been ordered, cooked and/or heated when the League Two fixture was called off at around 12.30pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>With a crowd of approaching 9,000 hungry fans expected for the match there was a lot of it.</p>
      <p>So some of it that could still be eaten - pasties, pies and slices - was distributed to the George House Homeless Hostel and Devonport House.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s stadium catering manager Andrew Bradford made the food drop-offs.</p>
      <p>The game against Grimsby was postponed because of safety concerns after part of the Barn Park End roof at Home Park was damaged by overnight gales which battered the city.</p>
      <p>Argyle issued a statement to announce the game had been called off.</p>
      <p>It read: "Severe winds overnight have caused significant damage to the roof of Home Park, rendering parts of the ground unsafe for spectators.</p>

      <p>The continuing weather conditions, with winds gusting to gale-force at times, has made it impossible to safely access the roof to make repairs.</p>
      <p>"With supporters' safety of paramount concern, and following consultation with the police and safety experts, we have been advised that we are not allowed to open the stadium.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, regrettably we have been left with no option but to call off the game.</p>
      <p>"In keeping with the rest of Home Park, the roof was assessed during the summer and passed independent stringent safety and structural tests.</p>
      <p>"We are content that the overnight damage was unavoidable."</p>
