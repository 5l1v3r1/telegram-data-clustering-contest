What is the origin of the oil spill affecting Brazil?
02 Nov 2019, 18:15 by AFP



The managing company Delta Tankers Ltd of the Greek oil company Bouboulina, ""the main suspect"" according to Rio of the gigantic oil spill in Brazil, denied on Saturday any responsibility in this environmental catastrophe, considering that there was ""no proof"" of leakage on the tanker.
The ship, which connected Venezuela to Malaysia, ""arrived at its destination without any problems during its journey and unloaded all of its cargo without any loss,"" said a statement from the Delta Tankers company which sits at the Phalère, seaside district of Athens.
Friday night, the Brazilian authorities announced that ""Bouboulina"" was ""the main suspect"" of the oil spill that has sullied more than 2000 km of coastline in the north-east of the country.
While the origin of the oil pollution, which would have occurred at the end of July, remained mysterious for weeks, the Brazilian authorities claimed to have identified with satellite data this Greek oil.
""No proof""
But according to an investigation by Delta Tankers, ""there is no evidence of leakage or transfer from ship to ship (STS) or delay of Bouboulina during her trip between Venezuela and the Malaysian port of Melaka"".
The managing company said it was ""ready to deliver documents of this study to the Brazilian authorities"" but these ""have not been in contact with us so far,"" she lamented.
The Brazilian authorities said Friday that a search had taken place at the headquarters of a shipping company in Rio de Janeiro without specifying the name of the company that has chartered the ship, with a capacity of 80,000 tons.
The prosecutor's office in Rio de Janeiro has evoked ""immeasurable"" damage on the Brazilian coast where many volunteers have removed in recent weeks several thousand tons of slab and black pellets on beaches so far heavenly.
On Saturday morning, a few hours before the release of the Delta Tankers press release, the Greek port police, which reports to the Ministry of the Merchant Navy, said that ""five ships, including one Greek, were considered suspect for this oil spill, according to the research carried out in Brazil "". However, it did not specify either the names of the vessels or the proprietor companies.
A black tide unpublished
The Brazilian authorities detected on July 29 the oil spill, more than 700 km from the coast of the northern state of Paraiba. On August 30, oil began to appear on the Brazilian coast, then moving south into Bahia State.
The authorities still do not know if the origin of this ""unusual"" oil spill is accidental or criminal.
""Investigations continue to determine the circumstances and factors of this spill (accidental or intentional), and to measure the volume of crude oil"" at sea, said Friday a Brazilian official statement.
A total of 264 localities in nine Brazilian states were affected. Many marine animals have died, especially sea turtles. Cleaning efforts are increasing as the high tourist season approaches.
As the world's leading fleet in terms of transport capacity, Greek shipowners have 23% of the world's tanker fleet.
