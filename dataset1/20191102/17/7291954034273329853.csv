Brighton stretch winning home run with victory over struggling Norwich
02 Nov 2019, 17:25 by By Press Association
Brighton extended their winning run at the Amex Stadium to three matches with a 2-0 win over struggling Norwich.
The Seagulls had to wait for their first home win of the season, against Tottenham on October 5, but have now followed it up with wins over Everton and Norwich.
Graham Potter’s side were made to wait until deep into the second half to break the deadlock but went ahead as Leandro Trossard poked the ball past Tim Krul for his second league goal of the season.
And Brighton sealed the three points in the 84th minute when Shane Duffy slid in to tap home a Trossard free-kick.
In contrast, Norwich have lost five of their last six, and remain second from bottom having amassed just seven points from 11 matches.
The Canaries remain without a win since their shock victory over Manchester City on September 14 and have managed to secure just one point away from Carrow Road in the Premier League this season.



Norwich had started the game well and came closest in the first half when Marco Stiepermann hit the bar, but as the game went on they struggled to build pressure and Brighton began to dominate.
Brighton looked to be on course to break the deadlock when Steven Alzate drove into the centre of the box before taking his shot, only to be denied by an outstretched leg from Tim Krul.

Midfielder Alzate had a second chance to score, with a dipped effort from the edge of the box passing just wide of the Norwich net.
The Seagulls were forced into an early change when centre-back Adam Webster was carried off on a stretcher in the 36th minute with what appeared to be an ankle problem.
With the half-time whistle approaching, the ball looped to Neal Maupay in the area, but the Seagulls’ top scorer was unable to control it, with some last-ditch defending from Norwich keeping Brighton at bay.
Dale Stephens dragged wide at the start of the second half, but it was a sign of the mounting pressure from the hosts.
And that pressure resulted in Brighton finally breaking the deadlock in the 68th minute when Trossard got an important touch from a Martin Montoya cross to turn the ball past Krul and into the net.



Moments later came Norwich’s best chance of the half but Emiliano Buendia fired into the side netting.
Brighton put the game beyond the Canaries when goalscorer Trossard turned provider with a free-kick which Duffy managed to get the final touch on for his second goal of the season.

BARRACA AND TANGANA
Rarities
Condition your life and that of your family, cancel yourself as an individual, prioritize football over the social, academic and work, speck the routine of superstitions and rites; the typical thing you do for your team
02 Nov 2019, 17:30 by Enrique Ballester
You can't be calm, they don't let you be calm. I was watching TV and Valdano suddenly said Rodrygo's father's age. Thirty-five years old has Rodrygo's father, just enough to be younger than me, who had hardly assimilated being older than most soccer players. I could still assume that, but this being older than the father of a Real Madrid footballer is already too much. I give up, because that day also turned twenty-five years of Raúl González's debut. Twenty five. Someone call the weather police. All this cannot be happening.
They don't let you be calm, for whatever reason, you can't be calm. On Tuesday I have to get up early and I have been overwhelmed for a week, thinking about the punch I will give to the pillow when the alarm rings. I have to get up early to record a podcast at 8.45. The podcast is called Nauru. The idea is to bring football fans together with Pokémon Go fans and examine and compare their oddities. I have been invited as a football fan, I think. Surely they ask me what is the strangest thing, what is the stupidest thing I have done for football. I hope to remember and answer that the stupidest thing I've done for football is to get up early on Tuesday to record a podcast at 8.45.
Sick passion
It's something I've been asked a lot. What is the weirdest thing I've done for football. I never know what to answer because I intuit that things that seem normal to me may not be so much. At home we had a pact. My wife, who goes from football, avoided the subject and let me do, and I did not ask why our son is blond if we are all brown, or why he did not let me listen to songs in English in the car because he said they gave him heat , which here would insert the emoticon that shrugs, puts on a face and raises its arms. The fact is that the pact worked: now that I don't write almost football and I can choose whether to go or not to go, to acquire a healthy mental routine or to continue the sickly passion, we still don't know what to do about it.
Condition your life and that of your family, cancel yourself as an individual, prioritize football over the social, academic and work, speckling the routine of superstitions and rites is the typical thing you do for your team, often without realizing it. I wrote football chronicles and for me the chronicle was sacred. I used to work in another newspaper: I went to dozens of shit fields on my own, losing money, because I thought I should be there, because the chronicle would be better and I have already said that the chronicle was sacred. Recently I talked to one of those bosses. He didn't even remember that he had gone around to write the chronicle live, it had erased it from his memory. I can't complain because I was going on my own. Maybe there is the weirdest and stupidest thing I've ever done for football: to think that it mattered.
Actually, the weird thing is not to be weird and it is best not to think about it. Everyone carries their own and Pokémon's to see what they tell me. The strange thing would be that the players continue to look like superheroes, and not kids. The strange thing would be to know. The strange thing would be that the years did not pass without realizing it.
