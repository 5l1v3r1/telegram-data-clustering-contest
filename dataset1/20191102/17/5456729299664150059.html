      <h1>Border closure: Chemical companies threatening to downsize workers, says Union leader</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:15:19+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/360708-border-closure-chemical-companies-threatening-to-downsize-workers-says-union-leader.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The National Union of Chemical Footwear Rubber Leather and Non-Metallic Products Employees (NUCFRLANMPE) on Saturday said the recent border closure by the Federal Government was threatening the jobs of its members.</p>
      <p>Goke Olatunji, NUCFRLANMPE’s President, who fielded questions from journalists after a council meeting in Lagos, said that chemical companies could no longer export goods to neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>Recall that the busy Seme and Idiroko borders, which separate the country and the neighbouring Republic of Benin, was closed in August.</p>
      <p>According to the government, the closure is aimed at checking the influx of smuggled goods, especially rice, small arms and ammunition, as well as illegal immigrants, into the country.</p>
      <p>Mr Olatunji said that chemical companies were threatening to downsize their workers as several goods had remained in the warehouses unsold as a result of the closure.</p>
      <p>”Some of the member companies are already lamenting over the poor sale, because their products cannot be exported to neighbouring countries,” the union president said.</p>
      <p>He urged the government to put in place effective monitoring and control measures at the border to curb illicit importation and exportation of outlawed commodities.</p>
      <p>Mr Olatunji said that government’s closure of the land borders without considering locally-produced products meant to be exported to neighbouring countries should be reviewed.</p>
      <p>“Nigeria’s economy cannot be better because of the land border closure. By closing land borders, some other sectors of the economy are suffering.</p>
      <p>”If the options are weighed, it is for us to open the border while putting in place efficient and effective monitoring and controlling measures to curb prohibited commodities,” he said.</p>
      <p>The NUCFRLANMPE president said that laying off of more workers would further impoverish the people, increase insecurity and cause decline of membership.</p>
      <p>He said that for the economy to become better, there was the need to return to the basics such as mining, agriculture and manufacturing as these sectors needed serious attention.</p>
      <p>“It is high time we adopted strategy instead of exporting our commodities and resources in their raw forms.</p>
      <p>“The monolithic nature of the economy for years has paved way for backwardness; petroleum is not enough. We urgently need diversification of the economy for better growth and development,” he said.</p>
      <p>The union leader further called for improved infrastructure such as good roads, effective power supply and adequate medical facilities that would cater for the upsurge in the population.</p>
      <p>He advised the government to tackle the rising unemployment to help solve the issue of insecurity in the country.</p>
