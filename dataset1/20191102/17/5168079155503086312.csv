新光醫院爆流感群聚 兒科加護病房7護1嬰中鏢

（中央社記者張茗喧台北2日電）新光醫院兒科加護病房爆發A型流感群聚，10人出現症狀，院方、疾管署均證實此事，至昨天已有7名護理師與1名新生兒確診，已隔離治療，其餘醫護及嬰兒預防性投藥，疫情獲控制。
近日有民眾向蘋果日報投訴，新光醫院兒科加護病房至10月底出現A型流感群聚事件，更稱因病房人力短缺，要求護理師不可讓家屬得知此事。
新光醫院副院長洪子仁今天下午接受中央社記者電訪時證實此事，他表示，自10月25日至11月1日陸續有8名護理師與1名嬰兒出現症狀，目前發病者均隔離治療；其餘50多名醫護人員、4名新生兒已預防性投藥，疫情已獲控制，並加強清潔病房區及公共活動區。
洪子仁強調，近日已向新生兒的家長說明此事，醫院院長侯勝茂昨天也探視發病的新生兒，目前病況穩定，且因應此起群聚事件，院內小兒科與成人感染科醫師也都予以支援，也按規定向主管機關通報，並沒有人力短缺、封鎖消息的狀況。
衛生福利部疾病管制署副署長羅一鈞表示，台北市衛生局昨天接獲新光醫院通報，兒科加護病房疑似出現類流感群聚事件，自10月25日至11月1日共有9名護理師及1名新生兒出現發燒、咳嗽、頭痛、喉嚨痛、流鼻水及肌肉痠痛等症狀，其中8人有進行流感快篩，結果7名護理師、1名新生兒皆檢出A流陽性。
羅一鈞說，上述發病護理師，其中4名體溫已恢復正常，其餘仍有發燒症狀，請假居家休養，另1名發病新生兒仍有發燒症狀，已移往隔離室觀察治療，將持續監測至11月9日。
羅一鈞指出，醫院已針對所有工作人員每天監測有無發燒或上呼吸道症狀，所有家屬、醫護同仁落實配戴外科口罩，宣導洗手及有生病症狀家屬勿探病，疾管署與台北市衛生局將持續監測疫情發展並督導新光醫院落實相關防治措施。
然而，新光醫院10月25日就出現個案，卻到11月1日才通報，是否有延遲通報疑慮。羅一鈞說，根據資料顯示，此波群聚感染發病人數趨勢為10月25日1名、27日1名，29日2名、30日4名、31日1名、11月1日1名，研判可能是30日以後個案開始快速增加，才經院內感控人員判定後通報，時序上還算合理。
至於這次疫情是否因為今年流感疫苗延遲開打所致，羅一鈞僅表示，醫院、校園本來就是流感疫情好發場所，疾管署已將醫事人員、學生列為第一優先施打對象，11月15日將優先開始接種。（編輯：陳清芳）1081102

New-look Pakistan look to stop rampant Australia

02 Nov 2019, 17:41

Sydney: In his first assignment as Pakistan's full-time Twenty20 International captain, Babar Azam has been tasked with stopping the juggernaut that is Australia at the moment, when they clash in the first of three T20Is in Sydney on Sunday, 3 November.Azam, who was named Sarfaraz Ahmed's successor as the new T20I captain after Pakistan's 3-0 defeat at home against Sri Lanka, will want to make a strong impression in his first game as the side's skipper. However, he will also be aware that winning against Australia, especially in their current form, will be no easy task.Australia come into this series on the back of thumping 3-0 win against Sri Lanka. They won each of those games convincingly, and the hallmark of their win was that there were contributions from all corners.David Warner was especially brutal against Sri Lanka, scoring over 200 runs in the series without being dismissed once. Aaron Finch, their captain, and Steve Smith were among the runs as well, while the bowling attack fired collectively.
Pakistan will hope that the youngsters, including the uncapped fast bowler Muhammad Musa, play to their potential and breathe fresh life into their ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2020 ambitions.Remember the last timeWhen the teams last squared off in T20Is in October 2018, things were vastly different. Australia, still finding their feet in the absence of the suspended Smith and Warner, were humbled 3-0 in the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan were in brilliant form then, and boasted of a team worthy of the No.1 spot on the MRF Tyres ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings. In fact, Pakistan are still top of the rankings charts, and will quickly want to return to winning ways in the shortest format.What they saidAaron Finch, Australia captain: ""They've got such a well-rounded attack. You've obviously got the height, bounce and pace of (Mohammad) Irfan. Then you've got (Mohammad) Amir, who is fast and can swing it. Very skillful. Then you have (Wahab) Riaz with all out pace, who can spray them around at times, but when he gets his line and length right, he's lethal. Then you have Shadab (Khan), who is a world-class leg-spinner who can mix it up a lot. Mohammad Hasnain is genuine pace with his right-armers, we saw him in the UAE earlier this year. He's got some real pace.""Babar Azam, Pakistan captain: ""We've got a plan ready for David Warner. He's one of Australia's really good batsmen. We have our front line bowlers, we have a strategy ready for David. Obviously, once he gets going, he gets going, but we have a strategy in place for all facets.""
