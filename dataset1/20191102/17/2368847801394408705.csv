02 Nov 2019, 17:32

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】英國埃塞克斯郡警方日前宣布，從目前的調查情況來看，他們相信該郡集裝箱慘案的39名遇難者是越南公民，但尚未獲得確認證據。另外，根據警方聲明，還有部分死者尚未確定身份。
當地時間11月1日，英國埃塞克斯郡警方公布了負責調查此案的助理警察局長史密斯（Tim Smith）的聲明。
史密斯稱，埃塞克斯郡警方將繼續與王家高級驗屍官和國家打擊犯罪調查局合作，繼續推進調查並幫助確認受害者身份。目前，我們相信受害者是越南公民，我們正在和越南政府保持聯繫。
聲明說，警方已和越南和英國的許多家庭直接接觸，並相信已經為一些受害者確認了家庭。但目前尚未獲得將案件正式提交給高級驗屍官所需的確證證據。所以，警方目前還不能宣布任何受害人的身份。
聲明並呼籲，任何人如果有任何信息可以幫助識別受害者，請和警方聯繫。
10月23日，埃塞克斯郡一個貨車的冷凍集裝箱內發現39名疑似偷渡客的屍體，包括31名男子和8名婦女。警方最初表示死者是中國公民。但隨後有多方消息指，一些偷渡英國的越南人在同一時間失聯。
網絡曾熱傳，死亡的偷渡客來自中國福建的福清和長樂兩地。隨後網上出現福州市長樂區外事辦公室主任曹以強簽名的內部文件稱，當地政府下令嚴防外媒記者進入「敏感區域」採訪，還有爆料稱當局控制死者家屬。自由亞洲記者曾致電長樂政府值班室，查詢死者是否來自當地，對方官員回答，他們要接到上級指示才能對外發布消息，並稱「我們這邊會根據上級部門的指示進行處理」。

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] The Essex police in the United Kingdom announced that from the current investigation, they believe that the 39 victims of the county container tragedy are Vietnamese citizens, but have not yet obtained confirmation. . In addition, according to police statements, some of the deceased have not yet been identified.
On November 1st, local time, the police in Essex, England, announced the statement of the assistant police chief, Tim Smith, who was investigating the case.
Smith said the Essex County police will continue to work with the Royal Family Coroner and the National Crime Investigation Bureau to continue the investigation and help identify the victim. At present, we believe that the victims are Vietnamese citizens and we are keeping in touch with the Vietnamese government.
The statement said that the police have been in direct contact with many families in Vietnam and the United Kingdom and believe that the family has been confirmed for some victims. However, there is currently no corroborative evidence required to formally submit the case to a senior coroner. Therefore, the police are not currently able to declare the identity of any victim.
Declare and appeal to anyone who has any information to help identify the victim, please contact the police.
On October 23, 39 suspected storks were found in a refrigerated container of a truck in Essex, including 31 men and 8 women. The police initially stated that the deceased was a Chinese citizen. But then there were multiple sources that some Vietnamese who had sneaked into the UK lost contact at the same time.
The Internet has been passed down, and the dead smugglers came from Fuqing and Changle in Fujian, China. Subsequently, an internal document signed by Cao Yiqiang, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of Changle District, Fuzhou, said that the local government ordered the foreign media reporters to enter the ""sensitive area"" interview, and broke the news that the authorities controlled the families of the deceased. The freelance Asian journalist once called the Changle government duty room to check whether the deceased was from the local area. The other official replied that they had to receive instructions from the superior to release the news and said that ""we will deal with it according to the instructions of the higher authorities.""
