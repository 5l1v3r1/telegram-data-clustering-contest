SOUTH AFRICA secured a dominant victory over England in the Rugby World Cup final.

Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe scored brilliant tries on an emotional day for South African rugby as Siya Kolisi becomes the first black captain ever to lift the World Cup.
















Jon Boon3 minutes agoNovember 2, 2019THE media in South Africa have been lauding their Rugby World Cup win, and rightly so. Supersport ran with the headline, 'Boks stick to Erasmus's gladitorial gameplan to down England' referring to the brutal nature of how the Springboks defeated the Lions. “A kickfest had been predicted for the final and – two blistering second-half tries from Bok wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe aside – so it proved as Pollard and Owen Farrell traded penalties early on. “But there was no lack of bite in a hard-hitting contest of gladitorial standards that left the players bloodied and bruised in a shocking advert for the attritional quality of test match rugby. “Even after six weeks of competition, there was no holding back from the two teams that have prided themselves on their physically confrontational styles of play.” The South African journalist James Richardson wrote glowingly about captain Siya Kolisi. “Siya Kolisi was inspirational as leader of the team making fools of those who suggested he would be better off left on the bench. “The skipper made tackle after tackle and helped the team impose themselves physically on England before he was substituted just before the hour mark.” While, Sport24 ran with the headline 'Springboks: This one's for you, SA (We're not crying, you're crying)'. They added: “Wearing green 'CHAMPIONS 2019' caps in the changing room after the match, Kolisi led the team's appreciation of the support received in a video selfie.”
Jon Boon2 hours agoNovember 2, 2019PRINCE HARRY might've been rooting for the Lions, but he was graceful in defeat. The Duke of Sussex popped into the South Africa dressing room after the game to congratulate the winning team after they destroyed England 32-12 in the Rugby World Cup final. Rugby fan Harry, 35, was seen joking with the thrilled winners, who washed down their victory with a few well-deserved beers. The Duke seemed relaxed and smiling as he shook their hands – despite the brutal defeat. The Royal Family also tweeted after the match: “A great effort by England in reaching the World Cup Final 2019 and congratulations to South Africa on winning a hard fought game.”
Jon Boon3 hours agoNovember 2, 2019TO be in South Africa's dressing room… After their monumental Rugby World Cup win, the players quickly got their wild celebrations underway after lifting the famous Webb Ellis trophy. One of their biggest heroes, Faf de Klerk got things underway when, stripped down to his pants, he took a swig of champagne out of the famous cup. The 28-year-old is seen passing the trophy around as his teammates take turns glugging champagne out of the biggest prize in world rugby. As music blares out in the dressing room, smiles are plastered across the South African faces as they look to savour the moment on the day that they became national heroes and rugby legends. Players are seen swigging beers and tucking into pizza as they celebrate becoming champions of the world. 🎥A MUST WATCH 🎥 It's all going off in the @Springboks dressing room 😂🇿🇦 Drinks are flowing 🍾🍻Kolisi throwing shapes 🕺de Klerk's in his pants 👙Prince Harry gives a speech 👑itvrugby rwcfinal pic.twitter.com/bynJlomMOU— ITV Rugby (@ITVRugby) November 2, 2019
