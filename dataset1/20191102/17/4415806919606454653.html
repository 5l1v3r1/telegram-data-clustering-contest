      <h1>Pressure mounts on Pellegrini as West Ham wilt at home to Newcastle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T17:35:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle roared into a three-goal lead and then held off a late comeback to beat West Ham 3-2 at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Goals from Ciaran Clark, Federico Fernandez and Jonjo Shelvey fired the Magpies to their second away victory of the season and hauled them away from the drop zone.</p>
      <p>They were assisted by a comically inept display from Manuel Pellegrini’s expensively-assembled side, who were booed off at half-time and by those fans who had bothered to stay until the end.</p>
      <p>Late goals from Fabian Balbuena and Robert Snodgrass gave the scoreline a flattering look that West Ham did not deserve.</p>
      <p>Before this Newcastle had not scored more than one goal in a match this season. Fernandez had never scored a goal for the Magpies. Yet West Ham simply laid out the welcome mat.</p>
      <p>Newcastle were always going to sit deep and hit the hosts on the break, but it seems nobody told West Ham.</p>

      <p>At 34 Pablo Zabaleta was chosen at right-back to marshal livewire winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who gave him a predictably torrid afternoon.</p>
      <p>The only surprise was that the Argentinian emerged for the second half, but he was far from the sole culprit.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini admitted before the match that the team were missing the presence of their first-choice goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. They certainly missed him when Shelvey’s free-kick slipped past the painfully slow dive of stand-in Roberto.</p>

      <p>The debacle began in the 16th minute from a Newcastle counter-attack, Issa Diop forced to foul Miguel Almiron as the speedy Paraguayan threatened to burst into the area.</p>
      <p>Diop earned a booking but worse was to come for the hosts when Shelvey whipped in the free-kick.</p>
      <p>Joelinton rose highest at the far post to head the ball back across goal and Clark nipped in front of Aaron Cresswell to nod home.</p>
      <p>If that was poor defending, West Ham outdid themselves six minutes later when a short corner found Jetro Willems, who lobbed a hopeful ball into the box.</p>

      <p>Fernandez, eight yards out yet faced with neither Roberto or any semblance of a defence, could not believe his luck as he tucked away a simple header.</p>
      <p>It could have been five by half-time with West Ham being run ragged.</p>
      <p>Saint-Maximin charged clear from the halfway line but his finish was too close to Roberto, before the French wideman tip-toed into the Hammers area again but opted to pass to Almiron rather than shoot.</p>
      <p>Moments later Shelvey’s curler from the edge of the box hit the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini hauled off Mark Noble and Andriy Yarmolenko at the break, sending on Manuel Lanzini and Albian Ajeti.</p>
      <p>It made no immediate difference. Newcastle had the ball in the net moments after the restart, but DeAndre Yedlin was offside.</p>
      <p>It was only putting off the inevitable, with Shelvey nestling his 51st-minute free-kick into the back of Roberto’s net.</p>

      <p>West Ham did muster a comeback of sorts, Balbuena scrambling in from a corner and, as the match entered stoppage time, Snodgrass volleying in a second.</p>
      <p>But it is now six matches without a win for the Hammers and, unless he can arrest the slide quickly, questions will start to be asked over Pellegrini’s position.</p>
