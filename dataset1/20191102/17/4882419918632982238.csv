Sergio Busquets came on from the bench for Barcelona during their 3-1 defeat by Levante. He was not too self-critical on behalf of the team when it came to speaking about the game.
""There's little explanation you can give, other than that it was a very even game where we did the difficult thing, which was going ahead on the scoreboard,"" said the midfielder.
""They had a burst of 10 minutes in the second half and did us a lot of damage, making the game almost impossible. These things happen in football, and although they ended our run we have no other choice but continuing.""
He added: ""The result was excessive.""
