Breeders' Cup horse named 'Covfefe' pokes fun at Trump, favorite to win
02 Nov 2019, 17:25 by Sam Dorman
Fans at Saturday's Breeders' Cup will get to see a competitor bearing one of President Trump's signature lines from Twitter.
Jamie Roth, who runs a LNJ Foxwoods stable, thought Trump's apparent typo -- ""covfefe"" -- would be a good name for one of her horses.
“We gave the name to her because we thought she was special and we thought the name was kind of funny,"" she told USA Today.
""Covfefe"" the horse, 3, is reportedly the morning line favorite for the Breeders' Cup and even has her own Twitter account that pokes fun at the president. Titled ""RealCovfefeRacehorse,"" the account often plays off of Trump's statements online.


TRUMP TWEETS 'COVFEFE,' CAUSES TWITTER FRENZY








""The Greatest #CovfefeHunt In American History!"" the account tweeted on Thursday, clearly playing off of Trump's ""witch hunt"" label for the impeachment inquiry.
Roth said she hasn't heard from the White House and generally tries not to get too political.
“I don’t try to get too political,’’ she said. “He’s not for me, but obviously he is for some other people. He just doesn’t stand for the things that I believe it. But I believe in Covfefe.’’

TRUMP'S TWITTER TYPOS: FROM 'COVFEFE' TO 'UNPRESIDENTED'


Trump famously caused a social media uproar when he mysteriously decried the ""constant negative press covfefe,"" in 2017. The president has since poked fun at himself, appearing in a White House video in which he jokes about the word.

Roth reportedly said that she was considering naming another horse ""Trump Tweets"" and reserved it through a breed registry for thoroughbreds.

Evelina defends killing her granddaughter even after Josiane is arrested and makes bizarre demand
02 Nov 2019, 17:18 by Russell
Josiane will be denounced by Téo in the next chapters of the soap opera Dona do Pedaço and will eventually be arrested and tried, yet Evelina will continue to defend her granddaughter. For the matriarch, the Ramirez blood is enough to justify Job's killing.
The villain will be arrested for the deaths of Jardel and Lucas, as well as the attempted murder concerning Theo. Gum will see from afar the moment when her cousin is handcuffed and taken by Camilo and Yohana, the punisher will soon call the matriarch telling everything that is going on.

publicity
Gum will still suggest that Maria da Paz be informed as soon as possible, but Evelina warns that it is to warn her father that she is a lawyer. She herself will contact her son-in-law and Amadeu will be appalled to learn that her daughter is a murderer.
Josiane's grandmother will tell the lawyer she got a fake alibi for her granddaughter and may have a problem with the court as well. Later Amadeu will talk to the character of Sérgio de Giza and he will tell that he went there to take his cousin to Rio Vermelho, but the police arrived earlier and arrested her.

publicity
Evelina will say this is normal because Job has blood from the Ramirez and the Matheus, but the lawyer will remember that neither he nor Maria da Paz are in favor of this killing and never needed to kill anyone.
Surprisingly, the matriarch will still make a demand on her son-in-law: “But you are a father, Amadeu. I as a wife have spent my whole life defending my family, creating alibis. You are a lawyer. You have to defend your daughter.
Amadeu will agree to defend her daughter, but first go after Maria da Paz to give her the worst news she could imagine.
