A shortlist of the 20 fish and chip shops who have netted a place in the final of a prestigious competition have been revealed.
The National Fish & Chip Awards, organised by Seafish and which celebrates one of the nation's favourite dishes, will be held on January 23, 2020.
A host of seaside locations made it into the top 20 including Rockfish in Devon and Hooked@31 in Pembrokeshire.
There are also a few Northern chippies hoping to batter their competition such as Fish & Chips @ Weston Grove in Chester and Shap Chippy in Cumbria.
Restaurants such as the Bearded Sailor in Leeds and the Cod’s Scallops in Nottingham are also hoping to hook the prize.

London Belmont Bay Fish Bar in Harrow also made the cut.
Each shop is carefully assessed by judges on a variety of elements including: sustainable sourcing policies, menu development and innovation and staff training policies.
The quality of fish and chips on offer and the levels of customer service provided will also be put under the microscope.
