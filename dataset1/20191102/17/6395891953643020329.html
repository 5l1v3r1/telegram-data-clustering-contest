      <p><b>BOGOTA, ColombiaÂ (AP)</b> - The Colombian government and Israel's ambassador have condemned the vandalism of a menorah monument in Bogota.</p>
      <p>The foreign ministry on Friday described the defacement of the monument on Israel State Avenue in the Colombian capital as an expression of "intolerance and hate."</p>
      <p>Israeli Ambassador Christian Cantor tweeted a photograph of the stone monument. It shows a swastika painted in orange on the base of the monument and the engraved word "Israel" is covered in paint.</p>
      <p>Cantor has thanked Colombia for its statement of solidarity and says efforts to fight anti-Semitism will continue.</p>
