      <p>A female college student’s accused killer has been convicted in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/demonstrators-reported-arrested-wounded-in-nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> after authorities there refused to extradite him to New York.</p>
      <p>Orlando Tercero, 23, fled to Nicaragua after 22-year-old Haley Anderson was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-police-arrest-three-more-suspects-confirm-39-truck-victims-who-died-were-from-vietnam">found dead</a> in his bed near Binghamton University in New York last year.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty of murder Friday by a judge in Managua in the rare legal proceeding involving the two countries. He faces a maximum of 30 years in prison when he is sentenced at a later date.</p>
      <p>“Today, justice was served as much as it can be,” Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell said, according to <a href="https://wbng.com/news/2019/11/02/haley-andersons-parents-speak-out-for-the-first-time-after-tercero-conviction/">WBNG-TV</a>.</p>

      <p>Nicaragua rejected the extradition request because Tercero is a dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizen. The Central American country prohibits the extradition of its own citizens.</p>
      <p>The Nicaraguan judge watched witnesses testified from Binghamton via a video hook-up.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Tercero left behind a note saying he was sorry.</p>

      <p>Friends of Anderson said Tercero was obsessed with her, according to reports. They were students at Binghamton and had an on-again, off-again relationship.</p>
      <p>Anderson’s father spoke to reporters after the verdict, WBNG reported.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if there’s ever a word for justice because there’s no justice for something as truly, for lack of words, disheartening as this was,” Gordon Anderson said, according to the station.</p>
