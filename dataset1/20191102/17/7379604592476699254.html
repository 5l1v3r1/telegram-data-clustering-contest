They added: “Wearing green 'CHAMPIONS 2019' caps in the changing room after the match, Kolisi led the team's appreciation of the support received in a video selfie.”</li>

The Duke seemed relaxed and smiling as he shook their hands – despite the brutal defeat. The Royal Family also tweeted after the match: “A great effort by England in reaching the World Cup Final 2019 and congratulations to South Africa on winning a hard fought game.”</li>
