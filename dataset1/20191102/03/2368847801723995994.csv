黃之鋒：中共可以禁止我參選 但不能讓所有人沉默

02 Nov 2019, 03:42

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】「北京可以禁止我參選，但我拒絕保持沉默」，日前香港眾志秘書長黃之鋒撰文稱，民主始於公眾，他希望港人以選票讓外界聽到他們尋求民主的聲音，中共不能讓所有人沉默。
11月1日，黃之鋒投書《華盛頓郵報》，指他是唯一一位參選香港區議員資格遭到取消的候選人，理由是選舉主任不相信他的政治主張符合基本法。
黃之鋒指控，港府這項決定顯然出於政治動機，無非是政治篩選與審查制度。
在此之前，黃之鋒曾三次以書面形式表明自己不支持「港獨」，但選舉主任仍然曲解他的政治主張。
他稍早前表示，由此可見取消他的資格是北京的死命令，政治任務。這也讓國際社會知道，「香港的一國兩制，已經是名存實亡。」
黃之鋒在文章中表示，在他決定競選區議員時，就知道北京可能會取消他的候選人資格。這項決定以及令人質疑的決策過程，也向世界展示了香港是如何屈服於北京專制統治之下。
黃之鋒此前還曾3度遭到香港政府關押。
他指出，近來香港人的憤怒顯示中共與港府並未從示威中學習。香港示威者呼籲北京遵守一國兩制政策，允許香港建立民主制度，直到2047年。這是港府表明聽到香港年輕一代呼聲，並將年輕人的聲音帶進區議會的機會，但北京甚至不允許香港有個短暫的自由窗口。
近來港府對示威者的鎮壓，也再次凸顯港人「五大訴求」的重要性。「五項訴求」包括徹底撤回修例、收回暴動定義、撤銷對所有反送中抗爭者控罪、徹底追究警隊濫權情況、立即實行雙真普選。
黃之鋒呼籲，現在是國際社會大聲疾呼的時刻。美國眾議院剛通過「香港人權與民主法案」，部分參議員也呼籲參議院盡快完成表決。日前，3名美國參議員又提出「香港如水法案」（Hong Kong Be Water Act），希望能對打擊香港言論自由的中港官員進行制裁。
黃之鋒表示，雖然他的參選資格遭到取消，但香港的民主運動仍在持續，而這只會讓企求改變的香港年輕世代激起更多憤怒。他還表示，儘管無法參選，他也會為民主派的林浩波等人助選，持續推動香港人權。
香港今年的區議會選舉將在11月24日投票，黃之鋒呼籲港人以選票讓外界聽到他們的聲音，因為這次選舉是對北京的全民公投，也是展現港人意志堅定與捍衛權利的機會。民主始於公眾，中共不能讓所有人沉默。
黃之鋒被取消參選資格也受到美國國會強烈關注，眾議院議長佩洛西10月30日在推特上批評說，「單獨禁止黃之鋒參選即將舉行的區議會選舉是再次破壞香港法治和『一國兩制』原則。」
她表示，「香港人民應該要能選擇他們的民選官員。」
多位國會參、眾議員也一致譴責港府的決定，並呼籲國會盡快通過《香港人權與民主法案》。
黃之鋒本人則表示，「政府不讓他踢地區賽，我就去踢世界盃，他們一定會後悔。」
他表示未來會以「被DQ師」的身份，推動香港人權法案在全球遍地開花，讓各國知道香港的選舉如何遭到中共操控。

Huang Zhifeng: The CCP can ban me from running for the election but not let everyone silence

02 Nov 2019, 03:42

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] ""Beijing can ban my candidacy, but I refuse to remain silent."" Recently, Hong Kong public opinion secretary Huang Zhifeng wrote that democracy begins with the public. He hopes that Hong Kong people will vote for the outside world. When they heard the voice of their quest for democracy, the CCP could not silence everyone.
On November 1, Huang Zhifeng wrote the book ""Washington Post"", saying that he was the only candidate who was disqualified from running for the Hong Kong District Council. The reason was that the RO did not believe his political claims were in line with the Basic Law.
Huang Zhifeng accused the Hong Kong government of apparently politically motivated, and it was nothing more than a political screening and censorship system.
Prior to this, Huang Zhifeng had stated in writing three times that he did not support ""Hong Kong independence"", but the RO also misinterpreted his political views.
He said earlier that it can be seen that the cancellation of his qualifications is Beijing’s dead command and political mission. This also makes the international community know that ""Hong Kong's one country, two systems is already in name only.""
Huang Zhifeng said in the article that when he decided to run for a district board member, he knew that Beijing might cancel his candidacy. This decision and the questionable decision-making process also show the world how Hong Kong has succumbed to Beijing's autocratic rule.
Huang Zhifeng was previously detained by the Hong Kong government three times.
He pointed out that the recent anger of Hong Kong people shows that the CCP and the Hong Kong Government have not learned from the demonstrations. Hong Kong demonstrators called on Beijing to abide by the one-, two-system policy and allow Hong Kong to establish a democratic system until 2047. This is an opportunity for the Hong Kong Government to hear the voice of the younger generation in Hong Kong and bring the voice of young people into the District Council, but Beijing does not even allow Hong Kong to have a short window of freedom.
The recent suppression of demonstrators by the Hong Kong Government has once again highlighted the importance of the ""five major demands"" of the people of Hong Kong. The ""five claims"" include the complete withdrawal of the amendments, the withdrawal of the definition of riots, the revocation of all charges against the counter-offenders, the complete investigation of the abuse of power by the police, and the immediate implementation of the universal suffrage.
Huang Zhifeng appealed that it is now a moment of great excitement from the international community. The US House of Representatives has just passed the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on Human Rights and Democracy. Some senators also called on the Senate to complete the vote as soon as possible. A few days ago, three US senators proposed the ""Hong Kong Be Water Act"", hoping to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who are fighting against Hong Kong's freedom of speech.
Huang Zhifeng said that although his eligibility for election was abolished, the democratic movement in Hong Kong continued, and this would only arouse more anger in the young generation of Hong Kong, which is seeking change. He also said that although he was unable to stand for election, he would also help the democratic Lin Haobo and others to continue to promote Hong Kong's human rights.
Hong Kong's district board elections this year will be voted on November 24. Huang Zhifeng appealed to Hong Kong people to let their voices be heard by the outside world because this election is a referendum on Beijing and an opportunity to show the will of the people of Hong Kong to defend and defend their rights. Democracy begins with the public, and the CCP cannot silence everyone.
Huang Zhifeng’s disqualification from the election was also strongly watched by the US Congress. House Speaker Pelosi criticized on Twitter on October 30, “The separate ban on Huang Zhifeng’s election to the upcoming district board elections is once again undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong and “one country, two systems”. in principle.""
She said, ""The people of Hong Kong should be able to choose their elected officials.""
A number of congressmen and members of the House of Representatives also unanimously condemned the decision of the Hong Kong government and called on Congress to pass the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy as soon as possible.
Huang Zhifeng himself said, ""The government will not let him play the regional competition. I will go to the World Cup and they will regret it.""
He said that in the future, as a ""DQ division"", the Hong Kong Bill of Rights will be promoted throughout the world, letting countries know how Hong Kong's elections are being manipulated by the CCP.
