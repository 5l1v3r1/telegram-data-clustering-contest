      <h1>Brooklyn anti-cop protest turns violent, blocks traffic: 'Don't let these pigs touch us'</h1>

      <p>Close to a thousand anti-police protesters descended on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">Downtown Brooklyn</a> Friday night, blocking traffic, vandalizing a city bus and shouting obscene insults at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">NYPD cops</a>.</p>
      <p>The demonstration formed soon after 7 p.m. on the streets near the Barclays Center, with protesters unfurling large banners that read “F—k the police” and “Don’t let these pigs touch us.” The crowd began dispersing by 9 p.m.</p>

      <p>The demonstration was in response to a planned crackdown on fare evasion by the NYPD — and two controversial police actions in Brooklyn subway stations in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>In one of the incidents, an NYPD cop sent straphangers scrambling in terror when he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/terrified-subway-riders-flee-from-nypd-cop-with-his-gun-drawn/">pointed his pistol</a> toward a window from the platform at the Franklin Avenue station in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>In another incident, an officer was caught on camera <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/teen-punched-in-face-by-cop-during-brooklyn-subway-brawl-to-sue-city-for-5m/">slugging a 15-year-old boy</a> in a wild melee at the Jay Street-MetroTech station in Downtown Brooklyn.</p>

      <p>“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” one protester, a 31-year-old woman who works in media said. “I mean, it’s monstrous. My f—king tax dollars are going to this? It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>As the protesters fanned out in the streets Friday, a group surrounded a nearby MTA bus and vandalized it with stickers and anti-cop graffiti.</p>

      <p>“F—k NYPD” and “NYPD KKK,” they scrawled on the bus with white marker.</p>
      <p>“They were banging on the bus, and then a kid with a white mask and a hoodie … used a marker to mark the bus,” one passenger said after getting off.</p>
      <p>“I’m not gonna lie, it was scary,” another passenger said.</p>
