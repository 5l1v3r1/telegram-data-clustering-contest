      <p>Air quality was “severe” in New Delhi on Saturday, a day after the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital shut down schools and declared a public health emergency till November 5 because of pollution.</p>
      <p>SAFAR, the government-run monitoring agency, said Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was 480 at 8:20 am—pollution level that puts even healthy people at risk.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor, and 401-500 severe. Above 500 is severe-plus emergency category.</p>
      <p>
