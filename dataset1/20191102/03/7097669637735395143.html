      <h1>Why the Fed Has No Choice but to Keep Cutting Interest Rates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T03:30:00+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Andreas Kern</a></address>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is stuck between an apparently booming economy and a financial crisis that might be right around the corner.</p>
      <p>That’s why its decision to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-30/fed-cuts-rates-by-quarter-point-while-hinting-at-a-policy-pause?srnd=premium">cut interest rates by another quarter point</a> on Oct. 30 – <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">its third reduction in as many months</a> – seems so odd. Lowering rates when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/oct/30/french-economy-growth-expectations-us-federal-reserve-powell-trump-pound-brexit-business-live">economy is as strong</a> as the numbers make it out to be is practically unheard of. And, according to <a href="https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Macroeconomics/p/1319105998">textbook economics</a>, lowering interest rates during a boom is a sure recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p>The trouble is, as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=SDV5M2gAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">someone who studies financial booms and busts</a>, I know that not lowering rates may be even worse. That’s because the corporate sector is dangerously over-indebted, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/why-the-corporate-debt-bubble-may-burst-sooner-than-you-think-4587446">creating a financial bubble</a>.</p>
      <p>A hike in borrowing costs could kick-start a cascade of bankruptcies in a financial contagion that would derail the U.S. economy.</p>

        <b>Troubles Below the Surface</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the surface, the U.S. economy appears to be humming along just fine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Unemployment’s at a half-century low</a>. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">Inflation is near its target of 2%</a>. And, at about 125 months, the U.S. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP">is charting its longest economic expansion since at least the 1850s</a>.</p>
      <p>Look under the hood, however, and things look very troublesome.</p>
