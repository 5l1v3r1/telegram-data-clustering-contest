駁韓國瑜控制媒體指控　蔡英文：若能操控韓就不會當選市長

針對國民黨總統候選人韓國瑜昨（1日）指控民進黨控制90％媒體，總統蔡英文今（2日）在台南受訪時幽默回擊：「我們要是有能力操控媒體的話，我看韓市長去年就不會當選市長了，不是嗎？」蔡還問在場記者：「問一下媒體朋友，你們有被民進黨操控嗎？」
至於賴清德昨說韓國瑜奇才是「奇怪的奇」，韓國瑜呼籲賴不要酸言酸語。蔡英文也聲援賴：「院長昨天才講一句他奇怪，為什麼韓市長回了這麼多句話？看起來是不是他很在意這句話？我要告訴韓市長，不要因為民調不利就酸民調，不要因為媒體監督就酸媒體，也不要因為民進黨團結就酸民進黨。」
由於今天蔡英文與韓國瑜都在台南輔選，二人距離僅5公里。蔡英文說，今天是好日子，所以很多候選人的競總成立，「重點不在距離，重點在民進黨是團結的」，會盡最大力量讓民進黨立委候選人和戰友當選。
被問到前總統馬英九日前在美國牛津大學演講時，提到台灣應對統一保持開放選項，也質疑台美關係友好但缺實效。蔡英文回應，台灣是民主國家，人民意志最重要，現在看到人民意志很清楚，「就是一國兩制是我們沒有辦法接受」。
至於台美關係，蔡英文表示，馬英九擔任總統時也非常關注台美關係，但馬的說法連美台商會會長都看不下去，講說馬總統說的是錯的，台美關係實質上有很大的進展。
另外，蔡英文昨宣布蘇花改明年1月5日通車，有人質疑是為了選舉考量。蔡英文解釋，設定1月5日通車是因為希望在春節前可以通車，因為春節期間很多人要返鄉，「如果工程沒有到那裡，再怎麼趕也趕不出來的。」

For the Kuomintang presidential candidate, South Korea Yu (1st) accused the DPP of controlling 90% of the media, President Tsai Ing-jin (2nd) responded humorously during his interview in Tainan: ""If we have the ability to control the media, I will see the mayor of Han. I won’t be elected mayor last year, isn’t it?” Cai also asked the reporter: “Ask the media friends, have you been controlled by the DPP?”
As for Lai Qingde’s statement that South Korea’s Yuqi was “weirdly strange” yesterday, South Korea’s Yu appealed to not to speak up. Tsai Ing-wen also expressed his support for Lai: ""The Dean said that he was strange yesterday. Why did the Mayor of Korea return so many words? Does it seem that he cares very much about this sentence? I want to tell the mayor of Han, don’t be so bad because of the bad polls. Tune, don’t let the media be supervised by the media, and don’t let the people of the DPP join the party because of the unity of the DPP.""
Today, Tsai Ing-wen and South Korea’s Yudu are selected in Tainan, and the distance between the two is only 5 kilometers. Tsai Ing-wen said that today is a good day, so many candidates have been established. ""The focus is not on distance, the focus is on the DPP is united."" It will do its utmost to get the DPP legislators and comrades to be elected.
When asked about the speech of former President Ma Ying-jeou at the University of Oxford in the United States, he mentioned that Taiwan should keep open options for reunification and also questioned the friendly relations between Taiwan and the United States but lacked effectiveness. Tsai Ing-wen responded that Taiwan is a democratic country and the people's will is the most important. Now, the people's will is very clear. ""It is one country, two systems that we cannot accept.""
As for Taiwan-US relations, Tsai Ing-wen said that when Ma Ying-jeou served as president, he was also very concerned about Taiwan-US relations. However, Ma’s statement did not even see the president of the US-Taiwan Chamber of Commerce. He said that President Ma’s is wrong, and that Taiwan-US relations have Great progress.
In addition, Tsai Ing-wen announced yesterday that Suhua will be open to traffic on January 5 next year. Some people questioned it for the election. Tsai Ing-wen explained that it was set to open on January 5 because it was hoped that it would be open before the Spring Festival, because many people would return home during the Spring Festival. ""If the project does not get there, then you can't catch up.""
