      <p>"Catch and Kill" author and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrow took aim at former President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons">Bill Clinton</a> on Friday night, saying the nation's 42nd chief executive was "credibly" accused of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes">rape</a> and that alleged victim Juanita Broaddrick's claim was "overdue for revisiting."</p>
      <p>Stemming from a panel discussion on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/politics-on-late-night">"Real Time with Bill Maher"</a> about the Katie Hill saga -- in which the California congresswoman resigned after allegations of inappropriate affairs -- host Maher posed a hypothetical about whether Clinton would have been treated differently -- for the Monica Lewinsky affair and other matters -- if he were president in today's political climate.</p>
      <p>"Could Bill Clinton, if he had done what he did in 1998, survive today -- or would his own party have thrown him under the bus?" Maher asked.</p>

      <p>Later in the conversation, Farrow addressed the question by stressing that the allegations made against Clinton are a "different" situation.</p>
      <p>"I think that it is very important to interject that Bill Clinton is a different conversation," Farrow told Maher. "He has been credibly accused of rape. That has nothing to do with gray areas. I think that the Juanita Broaddrick claim has been overdue for revisiting."</p>
      <p>Farrow, whose reporting took down disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein and helped propel the #MeToo movement, added that he thought Clinton wouldn't escape scrutiny today, saying society's views on sexual misconduct have "changed."</p>

      <p>The U.S. House impeached Clinton in 1998 but the Senate acquitted him and he went on to complete his second term in January 2001.</p>
      <p>In 1999, Broaddrick sued Clinton, seeking documents that might be relevant to her allegations.But a judge dismissed her lawsuit in 2001.</p>
