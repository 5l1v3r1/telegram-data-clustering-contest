'At least Beto is honest': Meghan McCain trades barbs with Cory Booker and his campaign
02 Nov 2019, 03:13 by John Gage
The View co-host Meghan McCain has spent the last week in a feud with Sen. Cory Booker and his campaign team after the New Jersey Democrat appeared on the show to talk about his presidential campaign.
McCain asked Booker to clarify his position on gun buybacks, which she compared to Beto O'Rourke, who she called ""crazy."" Booker responded to McCain by lecturing her on being civil towards opponents and advising her not to ""tear the character of people down."" The senator then did not respond with specifics of how he would remove the guns he wants to ban from people who are unwilling to give them up.



McCain, 35, looked visibly frustrated by Booker's answer during the show. Addisu Demissie, Booker's campaign manager, took to Twitter Wednesday to complain about McCain.
""Not sure what @MeghanMcCain was trying to accomplish with this question but @CoryBooker as usual handled it with grace, class and substance,"" she said.



McCain tore into the campaign manager for defending his boss's lack of policy specifics.
""You’re Cory Bookers campaign manager. I asked a specific policy question - he says he’s the most direct candidate and I’ll I got was a dodge,"" McCain said on Twitter before adding, ""At least Beto is honest about the fact that he wants to take our guns away.""






Booker's political director Sean Downey then retweeted praise of Booker over the exchange before McCain took aim at him too.
""Cory Bookers deputy political director apparently has nothing better to do with his time than this. Maybe if you spent less time on Twitter he wouldn’t be polling in 11th?"" McCain said.



Booker is currently polling at less than 2% in the Democratic primary at 1.7%, according to RealClearPolitics.
