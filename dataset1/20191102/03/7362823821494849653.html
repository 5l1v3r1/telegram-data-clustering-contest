      <p>"Real Time" host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bill-maher-urges-the-clintons-to-skip-dnc-convention-in-2020-the-dems-cant-be-associated-with-them">Bill Maher</a> went to bat Friday night for outgoing Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-katie-hill">Katie Hill</a>, D-Calif., saying she "could've survived" her scandals, and complained that Democrats "always resign" in such situations while Republicans don't.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people were saying, 'This is unfair, men have done far worse, which they've certainly have, she shouldn't have resigned,'" Maher said.</p>
      <p>"Then why did she?," he asked. "Then don't! Isn't it her agency to have not resigned?"</p>
      <p>He continued, "Why do Democrats always resign and Republicans never do? I think she could've survived this. I don't think she did anything that horrible."</p>

      <p>Panelist Christina Bellatoni, director of the Annenberg Media Center at the University of Southern California, pointed out the "similar circumstances" between the Hill case and those of two other lawmakers -- Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-rep-joe-barton-apologizes-after-lewd-photo-surfaces">announced</a> in 2017 he would not seek reelection after a nude photo and lewd text messages he had sent to women amid his divorce had surfaced, and former Rep. Chris Lee, R-N.Y., who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/n-y-rep-resigns-after-claim-he-sent-shirtless-photo-to-woman-on-craigslist">resigned</a> in 2011 after flirtatious emails and a bare-chested selfie emerged from an extramarital affair that spawned from Craigslist.</p>

      <p>Hill announced her resignation last month following multiple reported allegations of affairs with subordinates, including her legislative director, which triggered a House ethics probe. She blamed her "abusive husband," accusing him of being responsible for the leaks of nude photos of her, and claimed a "double standard" existed in the way men and women are viewed in similar circumstances.</p>
