      <h1>Delta Smartens Up, Restores Same-Sex Love Scenes to <i>Rocketman</i>, <i>Booksmart</i></h1>

      <p>Following backlash over its decision to censor certain scenes in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/booksmart-screenwriter-katie-silberman-interview.html"><i>Booksmart</i></a><i> </i>and other queer-focused movies, Delta has announced it will <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/delta-same-sex-love-scenes-booksmart-rocketman-1203390882/">restore the original scenes</a> to its in-flight movies. <i>Booksmart </i><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/olivia-wilde-calls-out-delta-for-censoring-booksmart.html">director Olivia Wilde</a> commented on the censorship at a Q&amp;A, saying “it’s a problem” that many lines of dialogue as well as a love scene had been edited out of the film. A love scene from the Elton John biopic <i>Rocketman </i>had also been edited out of the in-flight version of the movie. Delta spokeswoman Emma Protis responded to the outcry, saying, “Studios often provide videos in two forms: a theatrical, original version and an edited version. We selected the edited version and now realize content well within our guidelines was unnecessarily excluded from both films. We are working to make sure this doesn’t happen again.” Protis went on to claim that Delta has a history of supporting LGBTQ+ movies, with <i>Gentleman Jack</i>, <i>Imagine Me and You</i>, and <i>Moonlight —</i> the airline-equivalent of claiming, “Some of my best friends are gay!”</p>
