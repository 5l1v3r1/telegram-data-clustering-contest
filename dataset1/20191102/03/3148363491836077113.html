      <h1>Donald Trump: Conan the Dog Got More Media Coverage Than Me</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump celebrated the successful mission that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Friday but joked that the wounded canine unit that was part of the mission got more media attention than he did.</h2>

      <p>“Actually, and I’m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me and I’m very happy about that,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump commented on the raid during a rally in Mississippi on Friday night after the successful American special forces raid against Baghdadi last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Trump noted that the media quit reporting on the story of the successful raid as soon as they could.</p>
      <p>“That story disappeared so fast. Gone,” Trump said. That’s okay; I didn’t do it for the story. I did it because it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
      <p>He said that if he was a Democrat, the media would be talking about the story for months.</p>
      <p>Trump also praised the American troops that took out Baghdadi.</p>
      <p>“American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell I guess you could say,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump repeated that Baghdadi <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/27/donald-trump-confirms-death-of-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi/">spent</a> his last moments on earth “cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior.”</p>
      <p>“No enemy stands a chance against the righteous might of the United States military,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump said that Conan the dog would be <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/donald-trump-hero-dog-conan-to-visit-white-house-next-week/">visiting</a> the White House sometime next week.</p>
