日本财务大臣麻生太郎称 目前没必要制定刺激计划

02 Nov 2019, 03:10

【路透东京讯】日本财务大臣麻生太郎周五表示，他认为目前没有必要制定促进经济增长的刺激计划，否认了关于政府正在考虑制定刺激计划的媒体报导。麻生太郎在内阁会议后对记者表示，“我没有得到”首相安倍晋三的指示。外界普遍猜测，随着战后持续时间最长的经济荣景在美中贸易战的影响下减弱，以及政府关注10月1日上调消费税的影响，安倍晋三今年年底可能要求制定追加预算增加支出。瑞穗证券首席经济分析师上野泰也表示，日本政府可能会专门拨出50亿至100亿美元用于基础设施的重建。长期研究日本问题的策略师Jesper Koll预计的金额更高，可能达到200-300亿美元。日本经济新闻报导称，安倍晋三不久将指示内阁制定刺激措施，在当前财年追加预算及下一财年的年度预算中预留出一定的支出额，但未具体说明其规模。报导称，这将是2016年以来的第一项刺激计划，目的是支持台风Hagibis灾后安抚和重建工作，并提振经济增长。更多支出将进一步加剧日本公共债务负担，并可能令政府原本已经难以实现的、到2025财年达到基本预算平衡的目标更加遥不可及。日本公共债务负担是发达国家中最重的，相当于日本经济规模的两倍还多。

Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said there is no need to develop a stimulus plan.

02 Nov 2019, 03:10

[Reuters Tokyo] Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that he did not need to develop a stimulus plan to promote economic growth, denying media reports that the government is considering a stimulus plan. Aso told reporters after the cabinet meeting, ""I did not get instructions from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe."" It is widely speculated that with the longest-lasting economic glory after the war weakened under the influence of the US-China trade war, and the government's concern about the impact of the increase in consumption tax on October 1, Abe may request additional budgetary increases at the end of this year. Uesugi, chief economic analyst at Mizuho Securities, also said that the Japanese government may allocate $5 billion to $10 billion for infrastructure reconstruction. Jesper Koll, a strategist who has long studied Japanese issues, expects a higher amount, possibly reaching $20-30 billion. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Abe will soon instruct the cabinet to formulate stimulus measures, set aside a certain amount of spending in the current fiscal year's supplementary budget and the annual budget for the next fiscal year, but did not specify its size. The report said that this will be the first stimulus plan since 2016, with the aim of supporting the post-disaster appeasement and reconstruction work of Typhoon Hagibis and boosting economic growth. More spending will further exacerbate Japan's public debt burden, and may make the government's already difficult to achieve, the goal of achieving the basic budget balance by 2025 is even more unreachable. Japan’s public debt burden is the heaviest among developed countries, equivalent to more than twice the size of Japan’s economy.
