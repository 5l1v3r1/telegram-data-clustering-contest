California Preparing for State Takeover of Electric Company - Governor

02 Nov 2019, 03:23


WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - California has appointed an energy czar to develop a plan for a possible state takeover of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) after the utility company left millions in the dark during recent wildfires, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Wildfires raged across California this month due to strong winds that forced PG&E to leave around 1.5 million without power. A state regulator launched a probe on Monday into the unprecedented number of so-called Public Safety Power Shut-offs (PSPS) as wildfires threatened California residents.
""The state will not hesitate to step in and restructure the utility"", Newsom said on Medium.com on Friday. ""To that end, I have tapped my Cabinet Secretary, Ana Matosantos, to serve as the state’s Energy Czar to lead a dedicated energy team… and prepare a plan should the state need to intervene. All options are on the table"".
Long and widespread blackouts highlighted PG&E's ""culture of ineptitude"" and resistance to change, the governor added.
