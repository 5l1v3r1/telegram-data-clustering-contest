中南海圍繞香港激鬥 港府各自為政局勢混亂

02 Nov 2019, 03:34

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】中共高層內鬥延燒到香港，有英媒放風林鄭月娥將被北京撤下後，林鄭突然對成立獨立調查委員會鬆口，接著又出現香港警隊要出事訊號，然而，香港高等法院又頒布臨時禁制令，禁止港警被起底等等，港府各類自相矛盾的做法頻出。
香港特首林鄭月娥10月29日出席行政會議前，被問及北京有意撤換她，她會否考慮辭職的話題時，她說，她留意到中共外交部發言人華春瑩有澄清，稱有關報導是別有用心的謠言。她還強調，中央政府一直都支持她做特首。
在此之前的10月23日，有英媒披露，北京正在制定撤換林鄭月娥的一項計劃，相關方案如獲習近平批准，明年3月前就會任命臨時特首接替，並完成林鄭至2022年的任期。
當天中共外交部發言人華春瑩在例行記者會上否認了這一消息，聲稱有關報導是「別有用心的政治謠言」，重申北京支持林鄭。
但外界發現不到24小時，中共外交部官網刪華春瑩支持林鄭的文字紀錄。
香港《信報》說，本來很多大陸網站當日全面轉載華春瑩的官方口徑，後來都一概刪掉。報導說本次做法頗不尋常，有人揣測是否代表北京態度有變。
由於當時正值中共四中全會即將召開之際，中共內部頻頻就中美貿易戰、香港局勢出現不同聲音，黨內各派為爭權奪利屢有放風之舉。
香港電台引述香港中文大學高級講師蔡子強的分析認為，有關撤換林鄭的消息可能是代表北京某方勢力的想法，至於是否會出現這種情況，仍有變數。
資深時事評論員練乙錚表示，香港是四中全會的焦點，涉及到各派利益之爭，包括之前傳出林鄭將下台，不排除是黨內放料出來。甚至這些消息可能是中聯辦官員泄漏出來的，這派要搞那派下台，就放這些消息出來了。港澳辦裡面也有不同的派系。

林鄭做出罕見舉動

林鄭將下台的消息傳出後，她做出了罕見舉動。林鄭在接受訪問時表明自己並非要「盲撐」警隊，並說「監警會報告年底發表，如果民意仍然不滿，當然有責任尋找其他的調查機制」，如獨立調查委員會。
之前，林鄭多次堅稱不會成立獨立調查委員會的。路透社9月2日公開的錄音中，也提到林鄭月娥向現場與會人士說，「我除了3萬警察，其他什麼都沒有……。」
香港《南華早報》引述消息人士透露，若香港社會對警察監督單位「獨立監察警方處理投訴委員會」（IPCC）年底發布的報告不甚滿意，港府會考慮成立調查委員會，調查警方是否涉嫌濫權。
香港資深媒體評論員劉細良分析說，林鄭如果明年初下台，離任前她一定要為下任特首處理所有棘手問題，以換取新特首管治空間。年底發表監警會報告書，就是為獨立調查的開始。
獨立調查委員會由行政長官按需成立，專責調查單一事件。這種調查委員會的主席通常由法官擔任，有權力傳召證人作供。這個委員會被視為可以更有效保障證人或投訴人的權利。
一般認為，獨立調查委員會將更有效地調查港警的濫暴行為，現行的監警會制度由於沒有深入調查和傳喚證人的權力，對約束港警基本無能為力。

香港警隊突現多個出事訊號

林鄭月娥對成立獨立調查委員會鬆口後，香港警隊突然出現多個出事訊號，被認為預示警隊面臨整頓。
10月28日的記者會上，香港警察公共關係科總警司謝振中表示，警務處副處長（特別職務）劉業成的委任期已正式完結，於10月31日離任正式退休。
去年已退休的警隊前二哥劉業成，在反送中運動持續升級之時，於8月9日回巢被委以重職，主要協助警務處處長處理大型公共行動，其任期原為半年，至明年2月屆滿。
除劉業成外，警察公共關係科總警司謝振中和光頭警長也處境不妙。
謝振中10月8日起突然被放大假兩週至21日復出。同時還傳出謝申請移民美國被拒，北京不滿其赴美，更下令香港警隊中高層暫時禁止出境；「光頭警長」劉澤基兒子也被曝「申請新西蘭留學被拒」。
10月29日，「852郵報」創辦人游清源在自媒節目中披露，警務處處長盧偉聰早前北上，與中央港澳工作協調小組副組長趙克志會面，趙要求他交人，包括劉業成、謝振中、劉澤基及警察員佐級協會主席林志偉，並成立獨立調查委員會，將投訴警察課歸到廉政公署。
他還稱，警隊內部發出內部指引，警隊中高層暫時不准離境。他認為警隊已四面楚歌，未來將面臨被整頓。

敏感時刻 港警被禁止起底

在此敏感時刻，香港高等法院突然頒布臨時禁制令，阻止對警察及其家屬進行起底，有效期至11月8日。該禁制令再度引發民眾對港警濫暴的擔憂。
大律師黃宇逸對港媒說，這個臨時禁制令定義很闊，巿民在街上辱罵警察，或追著警察詢問其執法理據，都可能因為違反禁制令被判罰款及監禁。
香港大學法律學院首席講師張達明舉例說，教師點名讀出同學名字，如學生中有警察子女，未經同意下宣讀其名字亦算違反禁令。
而臨時禁制令，明顯賦予警方更大權力，和林鄭關於成立調查委員會的意圖相反。

林鄭月娥四面楚歌

劉細良分析說：有關林鄭月娥將於明年3月下台的說法，並非空穴來風。林鄭離任前有一系列放鬆訊號，預計年底發表監警會報告書，為獨立調查的開始。而前線警察也感受到危機，所以越來越瘋狂，他們因擔心自己被出賣，而更加仇視示威者。
全國港澳研究會副會長劉兆佳對《明報》表示，目前社會處於高度政治對立的鬥爭中，料林鄭說法是「兩邊都不收貨，反對派會斥她拖延時間，建制派就會批她立場不夠堅定、打擊警隊士氣」。
劉兆佳說，林鄭已無法取得反對派支持，若要繼續管治香港，需站在建制派一邊、建立堅實的聯盟，指林鄭嘗試在中間遊走只會「兩頭不到岸」。
《紐約時報》說，溫和派的代表正是四面楚歌的特首林鄭月娥，她希望能在北京預定的範圍內逐步實現更自由的選舉。但香港強硬派厭惡這種想法，他們對林鄭月娥願跟民主派談判、不願命令警察進行更嚴厲的鎮壓非常不滿。
林鄭月娥曾多次嘗試與民主派達成折中方案，包括最引人注目的暫停並最終撤回了引發抗議活動的引渡條例，但收效甚微。她也試圖與反對派開展公開和私下的對話，結果其中一次有損形象的對話錄音還被泄漏，並在社區對話中遭到民主派的尖銳逼問。
對民主派來說，她只是愈發依附於北京政府的名義領袖。因為在立法會上被民主派議員的怒吼聲壓過，她在10月16日的施政報告最終只能以影片形式播出。
親北京的香港議員田北辰接受彭博社採訪時表示，中共正在考慮明年換人，正在權衡人選，關鍵是林鄭平定風波的招數都無效，先有社區對話，後又實施《禁蒙面法》，好像她怎麼做都會出現反效果。
田北辰評估一旦風波拖延下去，經濟會壞下去，警民關係又愈來愈差，釀成嚴重的社會問題，所以北京才啟動換人。

Zhongnanhai fights around Hong Kong

02 Nov 2019, 03:34

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 02, 2019] After the CCP’s high-level cadres spread to Hong Kong, and the British media released the wind, Zheng Yuexi will be removed from Beijing, Lin Zheng suddenly set up an independent investigation committee to loosen the mouth, and then the Hong Kong police force will The incident signal, however, the Hong Kong High Court has issued an interim injunction prohibiting the Hong Kong Police from being bottomed out, etc., and the various contradictory practices of the Hong Kong Government are frequent.
Before attending the Executive Council on October 29, Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue was asked if Beijing intends to replace her. When she would consider resigning the topic, she said that she noticed that the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying had clarified that the report It is a rumor with ulterior motives. She also stressed that the central government has always supported her as a chief executive.
On October 23, before the British media revealed that Beijing is formulating a plan to remove Lin Zhengyue, if the relevant plan is approved by Xi Jinping, the temporary chief executive will be appointed before March next year, and Lin Zhengzhi will be completed in 2022. Term of office.
On the same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying denied the news at a regular press conference, claiming that the report was ""a political rumor with ulterior motives"" and reiterated Beijing's support for Lin Zheng.
However, the outside world found that less than 24 hours, the official website of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs deleted Hua Chunying to support Lin Zheng’s written record.
The Hong Kong ""News"" said that many mainland websites had completely reprinted the official calibre of Hua Chunying on the same day, and all of them were later deleted. The report said that this practice is quite unusual, and some people speculate whether it represents a change in Beijing's attitude.
At that time, at the time when the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party was about to be held, the Chinese Communist Party frequently had different voices on the Sino-US trade war and the situation in Hong Kong. The factions in the party have repeatedly fought for power.
RTHK quoted Cai Ziqiang, a senior lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as saying that the news about the removal of Lin Zheng may be the idea of representing a certain party in Beijing. As to whether this will happen, there are still variables.
Senior current affairs commentator Lian Yi said that Hong Kong is the focus of the Fourth Plenary Session, involving the interests of various factions, including the previous announcement that Lin Zheng will step down, not to exclude the party. Even these news may have been leaked by the Liaison Office officials. When the faction wants to let the party down, it will release the news. There are also different factions in the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.

Lin Zheng made a rare move

After Lin Zheng’s news of the step down, she made a rare move. When accepting the visit, Lin Zheng indicated that he did not want to ""blind up"" the police force. He said that ""the police report will be published at the end of the year. If the public opinion is still dissatisfied, it is of course the responsibility to find other investigation mechanisms,"" such as the Independent Investigation Committee.
Before, Lin Zheng repeatedly insisted that an independent investigation committee would not be established. In a public recording published by Reuters on September 2, Lin Zhengyue said to the participants at the scene, ""I have nothing but 30,000 police.""
Hong Kong's ""South China Morning Post"" quoted sources as saying that if the Hong Kong community is not satisfied with the report issued by the police supervision unit ""IPCC"" at the end of the year, the Hong Kong Government will consider setting up a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the police are suspected of abuse of power. .
Liu Jingliang, a senior media commentator in Hong Kong, said that if Lin Zheng stepped down early next year, she must handle all the thorny issues for the next chief executive before leaving office in exchange for a new chief executive. The publication of the IPCC report at the end of the year is the beginning of an independent investigation.
The Independent Investigation Committee was established by the Chief Executive on an as-needed basis and is responsible for investigating a single incident. The chairman of such an investigation committee is usually a judge and has the power to call witnesses to give evidence. This committee is considered to be more effective in protecting the rights of witnesses or complainants.
It is generally believed that the Independent Investigation Committee will more effectively investigate the port violence of the Hong Kong Police. The current IPCC system is basically powerless to restrain the Hong Kong Police because it does not have the power to conduct in-depth investigations and call witnesses.

Hong Kong Police Force has emerged from multiple incidents

After the establishment of the Independent Investigation Committee in Sung Kwan, the Hong Kong Police Force suddenly appeared multiple incidents and was considered to indicate that the Police Force was facing rectification.
At the press conference on October 28, Xie Zhenzhong, Chief Superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Division, said that the appointment period of Liu Yecheng, deputy director of the police department (special duty), had officially closed and officially retired on October 31.
Liu Yecheng, the former second brother of the police team who retired last year, was re-appointed on August 9 when the anti-delivery campaign continued to escalate. He mainly assisted the Commissioner of Police in handling large-scale public actions. His term of office was originally half a year. It will expire in February next year.
In addition to Liu Yecheng, Xie Zhenzhong and the head of the head of the Police Public Relations Division are also in a bad situation.
Xie Zhenzhong suddenly became enlarged on October 8 and returned from two weeks to 21 days. At the same time, Xie applied for immigration to the United States was rejected. Beijing was dissatisfied with his visit to the United States. He even ordered the middle and upper levels of the Hong Kong Police Force to temporarily ban the exit. The son of the ""scar head sheriff"", Liu Zeji, was also exposed to ""rejection for studying in New Zealand.""
On October 29, the founder of the ""852 Post"", Yu Qingyuan, disclosed in the media program that Lu Weicong, the director of the police department, went north earlier and met with Zhao Kezhi, deputy head of the Central Hong Kong and Macao Work Coordination Group. Zhao asked him to pay, including Liu Yecheng. Xie Zhenzhong, Liu Zeji and Lin Zhiwei, Chairman of the Police Officers' Association, and an independent investigation committee, assigned the CAPO to the ICAC.
He also said that the internal guidelines were issued within the police force and the middle and upper levels of the police force were temporarily not allowed to leave the country. He believes that the police team has been besieged on all sides and will face rectification in the future.

Sensitive moments, Hong Kong police are prohibited from starting

At this sensitive time, the Hong Kong High Court suddenly issued an interim injunction to prevent the police and their families from starting, valid until November 8. The injunction has once again triggered public concern about the port violence.
Barrister Huang Yuyi told the Hong Kong media that the temporary injunction was broadly defined. The public insulted the police on the street or chased the police to inquire about their law enforcement reasons. They may be fined and imprisoned for violating the injunction.
For example, the chief lecturer of the Law School of the University of Hong Kong, Zhang Daming, said that the teacher’s name was read out. If the student had a police child, it would be a violation of the ban if he read his name without consent.
The temporary injunction, obviously giving the police greater power, is contrary to Lin Zheng’s intention to set up a commission of inquiry.

Lin Zhengyue’s four sides

Liu Xiliang said: The argument that Lin Zhengyue will step down in March next year is not groundless. Lin Zheng had a series of relaxation signals before leaving office. It is expected that the report of the IPCC will be published at the end of the year, which is the beginning of an independent investigation. The frontline police also felt the crisis, so they became more and more crazy. They were more hostile to the demonstrators because they were worried about being betrayed.
Liu Zhaojia, vice president of the National Hong Kong and Macao Research Association, told Ming Pao that the current society is in a highly politically antagonistic struggle. Lin Zheng said that ""there is no receipt of goods on both sides. The opposition will refute her delay, and the establishment will approve her position."" Not strong enough to combat the morale of the police.""
Liu Zhaojia said that Lin Zheng has been unable to obtain opposition support. If he wants to continue to govern Hong Kong, he needs to stand on the side of the establishment and establish a solid alliance. It is said that Lin Zheng’s attempt to swim in the middle will only ""become two ends.""
The New York Times said that the representative of the moderates is the emperor of the embattled Lin Zhengyue, and she hopes to gradually achieve more free elections within the scope of Beijing's reservation. But Hong Kong hardliners hate this idea. They are very dissatisfied with Lin Zhengyue’s willingness to negotiate with the democrats and unwilling to order the police tougher suppression.
Lin Zhengyue has repeatedly tried to reach a compromise with the democrats, including the most dramatic suspension and eventual withdrawal of the extradition regulations that triggered the protests, but with little success. She also tried to engage in open and private dialogue with the opposition. As a result, the recording of the dialogue that was detrimental to the image was leaked and was sharply challenged by the democrats in the community dialogue.
For the democrats, she is only increasingly attached to the nominal leadership of the Beijing government. Because she was overwhelmed by the roar of the Democratic Party in the Legislative Council, her policy address on October 16th could only be broadcast in film form.
In an interview with Bloomberg, Hong Kong lawmaker Hong Kong, Tian Beichen, said that the CCP is considering replacing people next year and is weighing the candidates. The key point is that Lin Zhengping’s tricks are ineffective. First, there is a community dialogue, and then the “Forbidden Mask Law” is implemented. It seems that she will have a counter effect when she does it.
Tian Beichen's assessment, once the storm drags on, the economy will go bad, the relationship between the police and the people is getting worse and worse, causing serious social problems, so Beijing will start a substitution.
