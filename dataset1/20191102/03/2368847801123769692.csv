河南伊川農商行原董事被查 引發儲戶擠兌事件

02 Nov 2019, 03:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月02日訊】日前，河南伊川農商行由於原董事康鳳立被查，出現儲戶擠兌現象，引發當地政府恐慌。目前，為穩定儲戶，中共官方已在全省範圍內調配資金撥給伊川農商行，甚至在營業網點堆起了「現金牆」。
綜合媒體11月1日報導，10月29日，河南伊川農村商業銀行（簡稱：伊川農商行）連續第三天遭遇儲戶集中取款，網傳的一張辦理個人業務的排隊票單顯示，該銀行所屬網點取到1490號、辦個人業務的用戶需等待419人方可辦理業務，銀行門口排隊的人眾多。
網友發帖稱，出現擠兌潮的原因是，有消息稱該行「行長跑路，農商行要倒閉」。
此前傳10月28日晚，伊川農商行主要負責人康鳳立被相關部門帶走，這家銀行即將破產。消息擴散後，引發儲戶擠兌。網傳康鳳立涉及貸款、回扣等方面問題。
伊川縣官方稱，10月30日下午，縣委召開會議，應對伊川農商銀行擠兌問題。一名洛陽農商行高管確認，該行調撥了15億人民幣，並稱這是全省統一安排的。
週四當地中共政府官員、商界領導人以及銀行高管一起現身伊川農商行主要分支機構。他們依次對着話筒做出保證，表示將支持這家銀行，同時銀行員工對着電視鏡頭在網點展示大量現金。
但這些對於31歲的伊川農商行客戶Li Xue來說還不夠，在聽村民說這家銀行要破產之後，週四她連續第三天來到銀行網點試圖來取出她母親積攢多年存下的數十萬元人民幣。
這家分支機構的經理努力勸說她等到明年3月份這筆三年期定期存款到期後再取出來，屆時的利息將超過人民幣1萬元。他們甚至向她提供了收益率更高的產品，還有超市購物卡等禮品。但Li拒絕了。
在嘗試取款幾天之後，51歲的農民Zhang Yanting決定保留自己在該行的賬戶，用於儲存每年從政府獲得的糧食補貼。不過，Zhang還是想把自己人民幣1.3萬元存款中的大部分取出來。
週四，在排了幾個小時的隊之後，銀行櫃員把一疊錢遞給他，他高興地把錢塞進了包裡。除了在等候時喝的一瓶水外，Zhang並沒有被銀行承諾的禮品打動。
伊川農商行總部位於河南，截至2019年6月末，伊川農商行資產總額626.46億元，負債總額576億元。
據該行稱，伊川農商行2009年從一家農村合作社改製成為一家商業銀行，主要吸收農民和當地居民的存款。
根據中誠信國際評級有限公司(China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co.,簡稱：中誠信)的數據，截至2018年9月，該行的存款和貸款額分別佔到該縣存款和貸款總額的71%和82%。
根據伊川農商行的財務報告，近年來隨着中國經濟的放緩，該行出現了不良貸款增加的情況，並且因為同行的激烈競爭很難留住存款。
中國評級機構中誠信國際7月31日發布的伊川農商行的跟蹤評級報告顯示，截至2018年末，伊川農商行曾被中國評級機構債務警告。
中誠信的分析師在7月時指出，該行缺乏穩定的存款，同時逾期和不良貸款上升過快。根據伊川農商行的財務報告，該行2018年底不良貸款增至人民幣10億元，三年增加了10多倍。截至2018年9月末，該行逾期貸款佔貸款總額的比例達到28%。
報導稱，有關部門已宣布，該行原董事長康鳳立因涉嫌嚴重「違法違紀」正接受調查。
財新數據顯示，康鳳立是伊川農商行的第一大股東。伊川農商行股權結構極為分散，小股東林立。但小股東資質較差。工商數據顯示，伊川農商行有多個法人股東存在失信、被執行、股權凍結等情況；亦有部分自然人股東有失信記錄等。
