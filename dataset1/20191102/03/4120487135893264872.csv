社論:解決全民健保赤字措施

02 Nov 2019, 03:20

在佐科威總統第二任期开始之初，承諾解決全民健康保险（BPJS）問題，並成立全民健保管理委员会。但不是推行“健康生活运动”（Germas）。佐科威總最後反而選擇調高保險费的方案。這是根据2019年第75号总统条例（Perpres）正式执行的，该条例涉及2018年关于健康保险的總統条例第82号的修正案。 總統条例由佐科威总統于2019年10月24日签署。据称，该条例将于2020年初生效。通过該总統条例，每位第二級和第一級的投保人至少每月增加了一倍保費，分别从80,000盾增加到160,000盾，从51,000盾增加到110,000盾。 对于独立的第三級投保人，保费从25,500盾提高到42,000盾。财政部长絲莉·穆莉亚尼（Sri Mulyani）确实在佐科威总統的第一任期間就提出了增加全民健保費的建议。 尽管比国家社会保障委员会（DJSN）建議的增幅更大，而佐科威总統最終選擇了财政部长的计划。 这也意味着总统同意这样的预测：如果調漲不是100％，赤字就会再次出现。我们同意全民健保（BPJS）的赤字已经很严重了。到今年年底，赤字估计将达到Rp32.8万亿盾。 持续的赤字将危及全民健康保險(JKN)计划的持续性。但这种理由仍然不能保证健保费用双倍的增加一定可以解决全民健保赤字的問題。 全民健保本身的机制，实际上无法提供可以快速且完美的解决方案，因为诸如急剧調漲之类的快速解决方案，必須依赖理想条件。同时，正如迄今为止所面临的那样，理想主义与现实相距甚远，尤其是在参与者付款方面的合规性上。这也是全民健保出現赤字的原因之一。到目前为止，已记录参与全民健保的人数已超过2.15亿，而积极付费的参与者仅为53.7％。民众对全民健保卫生“互助”系统的了解程度较低，这也表明，有大量母亲在分娩后停止缴纳会费。 数量高达43％。这种态度实际上是可耻的，因为他们显然没有意识到他们所接受的医疗服务是数百甚至数千人的“捐赠”。 实际上，当您停止支付会费时，您不仅欠捐贈給您的人，而且还阻礙了下一个患病者接受“捐贈”。就目前而言，这种覺悟性是对健康保险体系的长期挑战。 如果人们的意识还差强人意，提高费用只是一个错误的解决方案。特別，有人認為增加保費後，將伴随着覆盖所有疾病，甚至超过私人保险公司的說法，這不是事实，請不要相信。实际上，卫生部长坚定地表示，必须合理化或理性化有關覆盖所有范围的說法。 据他介绍，倘若認為全民健保應該覆蓋所有疾病，所有行动的覆盖范围都是危险的。因此，我们希望政府不要忽视民族健康问题的根源。关于预防性计划的繁重，而漫长的工作仍然是公共卫生以及全民健保(JKN)自身财务状况的支柱。为了加快和协同健康生活的促进和预防工作，以减轻因疾病导致的医疗服务費的沉重负担，佐科威总統发布了2017年关于健康生活社区运动的第1号总统指令。可惜健康生活运动的宣傳不那么响亮。

Editorial: Solving the National Health Insurance Deficit Measures

02 Nov 2019, 03:20

At the beginning of the second term of President Zuckwey, he promised to solve the problem of universal health insurance (BPJS) and set up the National Health Insurance Management Committee. But not to promote the ""Healthy Living Movement"" (Germas). At the end of the day, Zorco finally chose to increase the premium. This is officially enforced under Presidential Regulations (Perpres) of 2019, which deals with the 2018 amendment to Presidential Regulation No. 82 on health insurance. The Presidential Regulations were signed by President Zuckwey on October 24, 2019. It is said that the regulation will enter into force in early 2020. Through the presidential regulations, each second- and first-level policyholder has doubled the premium at least once a month, from 80,000 rupiah to 160,000 rupees, and from 51,000 rupiah to 110,000 rupees. For independent third-level policyholders, premiums increased from 25,500 to 42,000. Treasury Secretary Sri Mulyani did offer a proposal to increase universal health premiums during President Zuckwey’s first term. Despite the increase in the recommendations of the National Social Security Board (DJSN), President Zocco finally chose the plan of the Minister of Finance. This also means that the president agrees with the prediction that if the increase is not 100%, the deficit will reappear. We agree that the National Health Insurance (BPJS) deficit is already very serious. By the end of this year, the deficit is estimated to reach Rp32.8 trillion. A continuing deficit will jeopardize the sustainability of the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. However, this reason still does not guarantee that the double increase in health insurance costs will certainly solve the problem of the national health insurance deficit. The mechanism of universal health insurance itself does not actually provide a solution that can be fast and perfect, because fast solutions such as sharply rising must rely on ideal conditions. At the same time, as has been faced so far, idealism is far removed from reality, especially in terms of participant payment compliance. This is also one of the reasons for the deficit in universal health insurance. So far, the number of people who have participated in universal health insurance has exceeded 215 million, while the active paying participants are only 53.7%. The public’s low level of understanding of the “mutual assistance” system for health care for the whole population also indicates that a large number of mothers have stopped paying their dues after giving birth. The number is as high as 43%. This attitude is actually shameful because they clearly do not realize that the medical services they receive are “donations” for hundreds or even thousands of people. In fact, when you stop paying the membership fee, you not only owe the person who donated it to you, but also hinder the next patient from accepting the “donation”. For now, this awareness is a long-term challenge to the health insurance system. If people's awareness is still unsatisfactory, raising costs is just a wrong solution. In particular, some people think that after the increase in premiums, it will be accompanied by the coverage of all diseases, even more than private insurance companies, this is not true, please do not believe. In fact, the Minister of Health firmly stated that it is necessary to rationalize or rationalize the statement about covering all areas. According to him, if the universal health insurance should cover all diseases, the coverage of all actions is dangerous. Therefore, we hope that the government will not ignore the root causes of national health problems. With regard to the arduousness of preventive programs, the long work remains the backbone of public health and the health of the National Health Insurance (JKN). In order to accelerate and coordinate the promotion and prevention of healthy living to reduce the heavy burden of medical services due to illness, President Zocco issued the No. 1 Presidential Directive on the Healthy Living Community Campaign 2017. Unfortunately, the promotion of the healthy living movement is not so loud.
