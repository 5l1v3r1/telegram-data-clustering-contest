        <b>Brazilian federal police said they have arrested Saifullah Al-Mamun, born in Bangladesh and considered by authorities one of the world's most prolific human traffickers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an operation conducted on Thursday after collaboration with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Brazilian police arrested members of a group allegedly implicated in a large scheme of smuggling people into the United States.</p>
      <p>Several arrests were made in Sao Paulo, where Al-Mamun was living, and in three other Brazilian cities. The police also froze 42 bank accounts it says were used by the group to finance their activities.</p>
      <p>Al-Mamun entered Brazil six years ago as a refugee, and was living in Bras, a diverse neighbourhood in Sao Paulo that is home to immigrants from around the world.</p>
      <p>He has been indicted on US charges. According to the United States Department of Justice, Al-Mamun is alleged to have housed people coming from Southeast Asia in São Paulo and arranged for their travel through a network of smugglers operating in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
      <p>According to Brazilian police, he and his group were smuggling into Brazil, and then to the United States, people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>They were sent to Brazil's northern Acre state to start a long and dangerous trip through Central America all the way to the Mexican border, to cross into the United States.</p>
      <p>Reuters was not able to confirm whether Al-Mamun had a lawyer in Sao Paulo who could be contacted for comment.</p>
      <p>Brazilian police said the group charged people coming from Asia around 50,000 reais ($12,524) for the attempt to reach the United States.</p>
      <p>Some would also stay illegally in Brazil, where they were given fraudulent documentation.</p>
      <p>Police said people suffered violence while waiting in Sao Paulo to start the trip north.</p>
      <p>It said a group of eight Bengali people fell into the hands of a Mexican drug cartel while traveling toward the Mexico-US border. ($1 = 3.9924 reais)</p>
