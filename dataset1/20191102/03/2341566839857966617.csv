黃之鋒：中國能讓我消聲 但不能阻止香港運動

（中央社記者江今葉華盛頓1日專電）香港眾志秘書長黃之鋒今天投書華盛頓郵報表示，雖然他尋求參選香港區議員的資格遭到港府取消，但他呼籲港人以選票讓外界聽到他們的聲音，因為北京無法讓所有人沈默。
有意參選香港區議員的黃之鋒，參選資格於日前遭到選舉主任取消。他今天投書華盛頓郵報（Washington Post）說明自己參選資格遭到港府取消緣由。投書指出，黃之鋒是唯一一位資格遭到取消的候選人。做出這項決定的選舉主任蔡亮（Laura Aron）聲稱他的提名無效，因為她不相信黃之鋒會堅守香港基本法。
黃之鋒指控，基於自己在維護香港民主權利，以及在國際層面參與這項議題的角色，黃亮的這項決定顯然出於政治動機，無非是政治篩選與審查制度。
他表示，在他首次決定競選區議員時，就知道北京可能會取消他的候選人資格。這項決定以及令人質疑的決策過程，向世界展示香港是如何屈服於北京專制統治之下。這不是香港首度取消黃之鋒的參選資格，黃之鋒也曾3度遭到香港政府關押。
黃之鋒指出，近來香港人的憤怒顯示中國與香港當局並未從示威中學習。香港示威者呼籲北京遵守承諾，依循一國兩制政策，允許香港建立民主制度，直到2047年。這是港府表明聽到香港年輕一代呼聲，並將年輕人的聲音帶進區議會的機會，但北京甚至不允許香港有個短暫的自由窗口。近來港府對街頭示威者的鎮壓，也再次凸顯「五項訴求」的重要性。
港人的「五項訴求」包括徹底撤回修例、收回暴動定義、撤銷對今為（至今對）所有反送中抗爭者控罪、徹底追究警隊濫權情況、以行政命令解散立法會，立即實行雙真普選。
黃之鋒呼籲，這是國際社會大聲疾呼的時刻。美國眾議院剛通過「香港人權與民主法案」，部分參議員也呼籲儘速完成參議院表決；3名美國參議員提出「香港如水聚散法案」（Hong Kong Be Water Act），希望能對打擊香港言論自由的港府官員進行制裁。這些行動向北京傳遞訊息，要求北京放寬控制，否則將面對國際壓力。
雖然參選資格可能遭到取消，但黃之鋒指出，香港的運動仍在持續，而這只會讓企求改變的香港年輕世代激起更多憤怒與挫敗。儘管無法參選，黃之鋒表示，他會為接替努力的林浩波等人助選，持續推動香港人權。
香港今年的區議會選舉將在11月24日投票，黃之鋒也呼籲港人以選票讓外界聽到他們的聲音，因為這次選舉是對北京的全民公投，也是展現港人意志堅定與捍衛權利的機會。「北京可以禁止我參選，但我拒絕保持沈默」，民主始於公眾，中國不能讓所有人沈默。（編輯：徐睿承）1081102

Huang Zhifeng: China can let me silence but can't stop the Hong Kong movement
02 Nov 2019, 03:33 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Jiang Jinye, Washington, 1st) Hong Kong Zhongzhi Secretary-General Huang Zhifeng voted today. The Washington Post said that although his eligibility to stand for Hong Kong District Council members was cancelled by the Hong Kong government, he called on Hong Kong people to let the outside world hear the votes. Their voice, because Beijing can't silence everyone.
Huang Zhifeng, who is interested in running for the Hong Kong District Council, was disqualified from the election of the RO. He voted for the Washington Post today to explain his eligibility for election to be cancelled by the Hong Kong government. According to the book, Huang Zhifeng is the only candidate who has been disqualified. The decree of the decision, Laura Aron, claimed that his nomination was invalid because she did not believe that Huang Zhifeng would stick to the Hong Kong Basic Law.
Huang Zhifeng alleged that Huang Liang’s decision was clearly politically motivated based on his role in safeguarding Hong Kong’s democratic rights and participating in the issue at the international level. It was nothing more than a political screening and censorship system.
He said that when he first decided to run for a district board member, he knew that Beijing might cancel his candidacy. This decision and the questionable decision-making process show the world how Hong Kong has succumbed to Beijing's autocratic rule. This is not the first time Hong Kong has cancelled the qualification of Huang Zhifeng. Huang Zhifeng was also detained by the Hong Kong government three times.
Huang Zhifeng pointed out that the recent anger of Hong Kong people shows that the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have not learned from the demonstrations. Hong Kong demonstrators called on Beijing to abide by its commitments and follow the one-country, two-system policy to allow Hong Kong to establish a democratic system until 2047. This is an opportunity for the Hong Kong Government to hear the voice of the younger generation in Hong Kong and bring the voice of young people into the District Council, but Beijing does not even allow Hong Kong to have a short window of freedom. Recently, the suppression of street protesters by the Hong Kong Government has once again highlighted the importance of the ""five claims.""
The ""five claims"" of the Hong Kong people include the complete withdrawal of the amendments, the withdrawal of the definition of riots, the revocation of all the counter-sentences against the present (to date), the complete investigation of abuses by the police, and the dissolution of the Legislative Council by administrative orders. Implement double true universal election.
Huang Zhifeng called for this to be a moment of loud cry from the international community. The US House of Representatives has just passed the ""Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy"", and some senators have also called for the Senate to vote as soon as possible. Three US senators have proposed the ""Hong Kong Be Water Act"", hoping to fight against Hong Kong. Free government officials impose sanctions. These actions send a message to Beijing asking Beijing to relax its control, otherwise it will face international pressure.
Although the eligibility for the election may be cancelled, Huang Zhifeng pointed out that the movement in Hong Kong is still going on, and this will only arouse more anger and frustration in the young generation of Hong Kong, which is seeking change. Although he was unable to stand for election, Huang Zhifeng said that he would help the support of Lin Haobo and others to continue to promote Hong Kong's human rights.
Hong Kong's district board elections this year will be voted on November 24. Huang Zhifeng also called on Hong Kong people to let their voices be heard by the outside world because this election is a referendum on Beijing and an opportunity to demonstrate the will and the defending rights of Hong Kong people. ""Beijing can ban my candidacy, but I refuse to remain silent."" Democracy begins with the public, and China cannot let everyone be silent. (Editor: Xu Ruicheng) 1081102
