      <p>Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek replied that police were already dealing with the matter and the police spokesman confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine whether any laws had been broken.</p>
      <p>Propagating ideology aimed at suppressing human rights is punishable in the Czech Republic. Displaying Nazi and reminiscent insignia is outlawed in Germany. In 1938, Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler annexed then-Czechoslovakia's borderland region of Sudetenland. A year later it seized Bohemia and Moravia. Between 143,000 and 260,000 Czech Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.</p>
