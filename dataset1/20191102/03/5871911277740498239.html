      <p>The Celtics had no problem parting ways with Kyrie Irving, as they signed Kemba Walker, and still have young superstar Jayson Tatum to build around.</p>
      <p>Irving is known for being a closer, which is tough to replace, but Tatum showed he can do exactly that during Friday’s game against the Knicks.</p>
      <p>The game was tied at 102, in the closing seconds, and Tatum received the ball in the corner. He used a nice move to get some separation, then uncorked a stepback, fadeaway jumper in the corner — and drained it.</p>

      <p>That shot carried an insane amount of difficulty, but Tatum drained it, giving his team a 104-102 win.</p>
