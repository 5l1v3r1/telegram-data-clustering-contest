到2030年 新加坡将部署2GW的太阳能发电

02 Nov 2019, 03:10

【中国新能源网】新加坡贸易部长陈振声在2019年新加坡国际能源周(SIEW)的一次演讲中表示，新加坡预计到2030年将部署2GW太阳能发电，相当于该市每日最高电力需求的10%。根据这一目标，这位部长表示，政府有望在2020年前实现350MW的太阳能发电目标。政府将继续支持采用更多的太阳能解决方案，通过简化我们的法规、SolarNova项目和在屋顶部署太阳能电池板。未来数年，建屋发展局的目标是在1/2的屋顶安装太阳能电池板。在过去的10年里，新加坡的太阳能并网装置已经从30个增加到3000多个。这座城市目前正在努力使其太阳能电池板的效率超过传统设施的15-20%，他说，这将取决于“他们是否能在现有水平表面的基础上使用垂直表面”。他补充说：“我们应该会看到更多的太阳能电池板来收集太阳能，可能是在水库，可能是在大海里，可能是在建筑物的顶部，甚至是在建筑物的垂直表面。”为了弥补太阳能的间歇性，新加坡还计划在2025年后提供约200MW的储能解决方案。陈振声说：“如果我们在全岛建立一个储能解决方案的网络，这也将有助于我们管理的能源网络的稳定性和弹性。”虽然这座城市正在积极的向低碳能源转型，政府仍预计未来50年将依赖天然气。不过，陈振声表示，他们将继续丰富天然气来源，升级发电设施以提高效率。“技术发展非常快，我们将继续确保新加坡保持领先，即使我们非常依赖天然气。新加坡也将继续发展成为液化天然气贸易中心。这将包括研究为新加坡增加一个潜在的液化天然气接收站，签发新的液化天然气进口许可证，并继续加强我们的基础金融和数据支持系统。”

By 2030, Singapore will deploy 2GW of solar power

02 Nov 2019, 03:10

[China New Energy Network] Singapore Trade Minister Chen Zhensheng said in a speech at the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) in 2019 that Singapore is expected to deploy 2GW of solar power by 2030, equivalent to 10% of the city's daily maximum electricity demand. According to this goal, the minister said that the government is expected to achieve the goal of 350MW solar power by 2020. The government will continue to support the adoption of more solar solutions by simplifying our regulations, the SolarNova project and deploying solar panels on the roof. In the next few years, the HDB's goal is to install solar panels on 1/2 of the roof. In the past 10 years, Singapore's solar grid-connected devices have increased from 30 to more than 3,000. The city is currently working to make its solar panels more efficient than 15-20% of traditional facilities, which he says will depend on ""whether they can use vertical surfaces on existing horizontal surfaces."" He added: ""We should see more solar panels to collect solar energy, possibly in the reservoir, possibly in the sea, perhaps at the top of the building, or even on the vertical surface of the building."" To compensate for the intermittent nature of solar energy, Singapore also plans to provide about 200MW of energy storage solutions after 2025. Chen Zhensheng said: ""If we build a network of energy storage solutions across the island, this will also help us manage the stability and flexibility of the energy network."" Although the city is actively transforming to low-carbon energy, the government It is still expected to rely on natural gas for the next 50 years. However, Chen Zhensheng said that they will continue to enrich natural gas sources and upgrade power generation facilities to improve efficiency. “Technology is growing very fast and we will continue to ensure that Singapore stays ahead, even if we rely heavily on natural gas. Singapore will continue to develop into a LNG trading centre. This will include research to add a potential LNG terminal to Singapore and issue new liquefaction. Natural gas import licenses and continue to strengthen our basic financial and data support systems.""
