Perez: ""Track conditions were extremely poor""
02 Nov 2019, 16:28 by Adam Newton

Sergio Perez was not happy with the condition of the track during Friday practice, as the bumps on the Circuit of the Americas made it difficult for drivers to find rhythm. The Mexican was only able to set the 14th and 15th fastest times in the first two practice sessions as he looks to continue his terrific form for Racing Point.

After eight scoreless races, Perez has picked up 30 points in six races and moved up to ninth in the standings, but he was not happy with the first day at the United States Grand Prix, as he was slower than teammate Lance Stroll in both sessions.



Following the sessions, Perez said: “The track conditions today were extremely poor and there were quite a few people having problems with the bumps. I struggled with the balance of the car so I need to try and improve that for tomorrow.

""Lance was a lot stronger - not just over one lap, but also in the long runs - so hopefully I can pick it up tomorrow and be in contention for Q3. It’s most important to improve my race pace because that’s where the points are awarded.”
