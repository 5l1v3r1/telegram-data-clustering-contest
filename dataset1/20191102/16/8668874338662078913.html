      <h1>The only Boks player to beat England in two World Cup finals is feeling emotional</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T16:02:07+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Replacement <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa/players/frans-steyn/">Frans Steyn</a> only played the closing minutes of the 2019 World Cup final but the 2007 winner was thrilled to bridge the 12-year gap since <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> last ruled the rugby world.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old, who started the pool matches versus <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup/teams/namibia">Namibia</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/canada">Canada</a> at the finals in Japan, dedicated his involvement from the bench in the decider to his family.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/south-africa-player-ratings-vs-england">It’s amazing of course</a>,” he said, reflecting on life since that previous World Cup final win by South Africa over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in 2007. “I’ve gone through so much since that World Cup.</p>
      <p>“I lost my uncle a couple of weeks ago. I lost my brother a few years ago. So everything has changed a lot in that time from where I was then to where I am now.</p>
      <p>“So on the bus on the way here, that’s what I was thinking about. They were with me in here before tonight’s game.”</p>

      <p>Sizing up the difference between the twin triumphs, he added: “I’m older now compared to these guys who are younger. I don’t think it has hit them what they have done yet. But it will when they get home.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a WhatsApp group with the players from that (2007) tournament. We still stay in touch and have a laugh. That’s the sort of thing these guys will have too.</p>
      <p>“It [winning] is huge, as the country is in a worse position now than it was then. There have been numerous droughts recently and a ton of other stuff. Hopefully, it can bring the country together.”</p>
