Their swords crossed the One Line Weekend show with ND chief Sakis Ioannidis and SYRIZA Political Secretariat member Nikos Scorpinis on the issue of migrant refugee and the Novartis case.
After accusing the previous government, Mr Ioannidis argued that important measures are being put in place to deal with migrant - refugee treatment with European refugee authorities as a basic principle, but also to prevent more people from entering the country.

For his part, Mr Scorpinis has spoken out against the ND government for lack of a genuine proposal and attempt to transfer responsibility to SYRIZA and stressed that ""a refugee and an immigrant is not a human being"".
The two men disagreed over the countries of origin of refugees over whether they were war zones, and therefore whether the people coming from them could enjoy refugee status and equivalent treatment.
In addition to the migrant - refugee situation, tensions also fueled the Novartis case and the majority decision to exclude the Giannakopoulos and Polakis committee.
