      <h1>UAW President Taking Paid Leave Amid Corruption Investigation</h1>

      <p>DETROIT (AP) — United Auto Workers President Gary Jones is taking a paid leave of absence amid a federal investigation of corruption in the union.</p>
      <p>The UAW said Jones requested the leave, which is effective Sunday.</p>
      <p>The federal government has been investigating fraud and misuse of funds at the UAW for more than two years.</p>
      <p>Jones has not been charged. But in a recent court filing, federal prosecutors alleged that seven top UAW officials conspired since 2010 to embezzle funds through schemes such as submitting false vouchers for conference expenses.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Jones said he’s stepping aside so the union can focus on negotiating better contracts for its workers.</p>
      <p>UAW Vice President Rory Gamble will serve as acting president. He recently negotiated the union’s tentative agreement with Ford Motor Co.</p>
