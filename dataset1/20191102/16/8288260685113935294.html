      <h1>Birmingham City angry as Premier League referee once again causes penalty controversy</h1>
      <h2>With Blues comfortable and leading 1-0 at Cardiff City after Kristian Pedersen’s early strike, the official awarded the hosts a penalty to hand the Bluebirds a spot-kick on the half hour</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T16:00:33+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Premier League referee Andrew Madley was once again at the heart of a penalty controversy, this time during <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a>’s match with Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>With Blues comfortable and leading 1-0 after Kristian  Pedersen’s early strike the official awarded the hosts a penalty to  hand the Bluebirds a spot-kick on the half hour.</p>
      <p>Cardiff had a corner before which Madley spoke to Maxime Colin and Marlon Pack about wrestling off the ball.</p>
      <p>When the delivery finally came in Blues headed it clear but Madley pointed straight to the spot affording Ralls the chance to level.</p>
      <p>Before Ralls stepped up Madley spoke to Harlee Dean.</p>
      <p>Madley returned to Championship duty after officiating Brighton’s 3-2 win over Everton last weekend.</p>
      <p>The game was not without controversy as Brighton were awarded a penalty via VAR after Madley had initially said nothing should be given.</p>
      <p>However, referee Lee Mason reportedly viewed replays 14 times before deciding the hosts should have a spot kick.</p>
      <p>Former Premier League referee Peter Walton criticised Madley for his part in the decision.</p>
      <p>“The VAR in that game, Lee Mason, has told Andy Madley that is a penalty kick,” he told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>“Again we go back to whether the referee should go over to the monitor. I think Andy Madley should have went over to the monitor and said let me have a look.</p>
      <p>“It is a huge decision to be given in a game like this.”</p>

      <p>Clearly there is no VAR facility in the Championship but this time the referee had no hesitation pointing to the spot.</p>
      <p>The decision came after Peter Bankes had awarded Wigan a penalty when Swansea’s Mike van der Hoorn tugged Chey Dunkley’s shirt in the earlier game.</p>
      <p>Soon after Blues conceded a second goal to Curtis Nelson and trailed 2-1 at the break.</p>
