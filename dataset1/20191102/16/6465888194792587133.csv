Goals scored: Aguero 70, Walker 86 - Ward-Prowse 13.

The end of the match in the 11th Premier League match takes place under the common scenario of Man City this season. On the electronic board, the score was 2-1 in favor of the defending champions, and on the pitch, Guardiola's students repeatedly pressed and shattered the Southampton goal in the cheering excitedly from the home crowd. Gabriel Jesus even missed a golden opportunity to widen the lead when he hit the goalkeeper of McCarthy in stoppage time.
But that ending did not reflect the situation at Etihad, where Man City experienced one of their hardest matches from the start of the season. The powerful stars under Guardiola conceded from the 13th minute because of goalkeeper Ederson's mistake, then struggled for nearly an hour and could not find a goal.
Amidst the silence of the top attacking stars, Man City suddenly found the light at the end of the tunnel, thanks to the timely shine of a defender. 70 minutes, Kyle Walker joined the attack, approached the crossbar, and then passed in a low range as set, to Sergio Aguero kick 1-1 equalizer. 16 minutes later, still a right-back in the right place in the penalty area, picked up the ball from the unsuccessful clearance of goalkeeper McCarthy, then padded into an empty net, fixing the 2-1 result. the defending champion.

Statistics after the game showed that Man City controlled the ball to 77% of the time and launched up to 25 shots. Those numbers and the final result show that the home team deserves to win after tireless efforts, but also a compliment for the visitors for their 90 minutes of courage in Etihad.
Southampton to Manchester with heavy luggage because of the last two results. In round 10 of the Premier League last week, they received a record 0-9 defeat at Leicester. In the middle of this week, in the League Cup of England, Southampton lost another 1-3 while at Etihad, at the hands of City. But it seems the Cup match a few days ago helped coach Ralph Hasenhuttl find a way to deal with the opponent's fire.
With a backline of five and the backline deep, Southampton in turn repelled all of City's attacking efforts. Not only that, until the 13th minute, the visitors took the lead. From Armstrong's long-range shot, goalkeeper Ederson caught the ball and James Ward-Prowse hit the right time to kick back, nudge the Premier League champions.
After opening the score, the away team played defensive thoroughly, with 11 players often backing to the home field. At many times, Southampton concentrated all forces in the 16m50 area to resist pressure from the host. They actively surround and break the ball immediately. Therefore, although the ball control is always at an average of 70% and put all his energy, except goalkeeper Ederson, to the opponent's court, Man City has not once made it difficult for goalkeeper McCarthy.

From the impatience, Guardiola showed his inhibition and anxiety on the border when he saw his students struggling but could not find a solution to penetrate the multi-layered defensive system of Southampton. After Aguero equalized 1-1 in the 70th minute, Guardiola was even more restless.
Man City won against Southampton in the last five meetings in the Premier League, and Guardiola did not want the home team to break that result. He repeatedly urged his students to attack, and got angry after the beats of Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. However, the efforts of the defending champions also paid off with a table setting the result of Kyle Walker.
A 2-1 win helped Man City secure second place and continued to chase the top of the Liverpool table, the team also won 2-1 at Aston Villa in the match at the same time. The difference between the two teams is still six points after 11 matches.
