Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan has quite a few unsuspecting fans star-struck when he peeked beyond his compound wall to greet them as they spent their day by the beach. The star was all smiles as fans quickly flocked around to get photos of him.
Sharing a click of the sweet interaction, the star also extended greetings to the people celebrating the Chhath festival.
“Happy Chhath Puja to all the devotees who are undergoing the tough rituals of this great festival. Sending my love to all of you and my thanks to those who took a moment to interact with me at the beach today,” he captioned the photo.



The Chhath festival, which started on Thursday, is celebrated with fervour in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Every year, the festival commences with oblation to the setting sun and concludes with the rising sun.
This year, Chhath Puja will be celebrated from the evening of November 2 till the morning of November 3.
After two back-to-back box office hits, Hrithik is looking forward to his next film. While he is rumoured to be working on ‘Krrish 4’, his name has also been floating around as the possible male lead in one of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s upcoming films.
