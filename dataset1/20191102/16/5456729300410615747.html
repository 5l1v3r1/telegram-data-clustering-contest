      <p>The Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) in Ogun State on Saturday said that a man died while nine other passengers sustained various degrees of injuries in an accident on the Lagos- Ibadan Expressway.</p>
      <p>Babatunde Akinbiyi, the TRACE Spokesperson, told journalists in Abeokuta that the accident involving a Mazda bus and a Mack tanker occurred at 10:15 a.m. near Saapade bridge after Ogere.</p>
      <p>“The bus marked KRE-495 XA was coming from Ibadan while the tanker with registration number LND-868 XN was inbound Ibadan from Lagos.</p>
      <p>“The axis is a diversion zone, with inbound and outbound traffic sharing the outbound traffic together due to the ongoing road reconstruction and rehabilitation by <b><a href="http://www.rccnigeria.com/">Reynold Construction Company (RCC)</a></b>.</p>
      <p>“The bus driver didn’t calculate well before overtaking the vehicle in its front which resulted in a head-on collision with the tanker, which was on its rightful lane,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinbiyi explained that five male adults and four female adults sustained injuries while one male adult died in the accident.</p>
      <p>The TRACE spokesperson said the injured victims were taken to the State Hospital, Isara, while the deceased was deposited at FOS Mortuary, Ipara.</p>
      <p>Mr Akinbiyi advised motorists to always keep to the 50km speed limit at construction areas/axis in order to avoid mishaps.</p>
