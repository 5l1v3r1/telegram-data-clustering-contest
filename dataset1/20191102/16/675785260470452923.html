      <h2>Joshua King scored the only goal as Bournemouth condemned Man Utd to their fourth Premier League defeat of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T16:20:54+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Rio Ferdinand has explained the mistakes Aaron Wan-Bissaka made when Joshua King scored for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Former United academy graduate King netted the only goal at the Vitality Stadium and condemn the Red Devils to their fourth Premier League defeat of the season.</p>
      <p>Cherries striker King drifted off Victor Lindelof before chesting Adam Smith's clip into the box. He then brilliantly flicked the ball over Wan-Bissaka before smashing the ball past David de Gea.</p>
      <p>Right-back Wan-Bissaka took the brunt of the blame for the goal from United legend Ferdinand in the BT Sport studio.</p>

      <p>“He has got to wait and be patient," Ferdinand explained. "You have got to be patient.</p>
      <p>“In that area, you have almost got to slow the situation down in your own mind. You haven’t got to rush into anything.</p>
      <p>“The forward has got his back to goal. What move is he going to make? Once he makes a move, you have to react and try to shut down that shot.</p>

      <p>“What he did was, he went to have a nibble around one side, that made Josh King’s mind up, he then rolled him, held him off, and put it in with a wonderful finish in the end.”</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> midfielder Joe Cole added: “He has a nibble, Josh King feels him and he just rolls him. It is a great finish.</p>
      <p>“But for me, Wan-Bissaka has got to be standing his ground there and be patient in the box. He just has a nibble and it is too easy, but it is a great finish from King.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted he made a team selection error on the south coast.</p>
      <p>"Maybe I should have started a couple of others, who knows," Solskjaer said. "I felt we started the game well.</p>
      <p>"If you want to be challenging for top four, you need to win games like this."</p>
