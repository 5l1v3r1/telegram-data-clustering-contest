$60 at Amazon







Tense and scary: Resident Evil 2 Remake
Horror fans owe it to themselves to play the Resident Evil 2 Remake, and it's not something anyone else should miss out on either — if you can stomach it. Quickly regarded as one of the greatest remakes of all time, Resident Evil 2 gives players a choice on PS4 Pro of choosing between checkerboarded 4K at 30FPS or a lower resolution at 60FPS. Zombies never looked so good.

$26 at Amazon







RPG Greatness: Outer Worlds
From the creators of Fallout: New Vegas comes one of the hottest games this year. The RPG elements are breathtaking, as are the worlds you get to explore. When you are using a PS4 Pro, the worlds come alive like never before.

$60 at Amazon







Kick some Nazi ass: Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is exactly what some players needed in today's political climate: a way to kick ass against Nazis and KKK members. As it turns out, it happened to be a load of fun, and over on PS4 Pro, the resolution is bumped up to 1440p. It's not the most impressive enhancement, but it's certainly welcome.

$19 at Amazon







Wild West outlaws: Red Dead Redemption 2
Rockstar makes some of the best games in the business, as evidenced by Red Dead Redemption 2. You'll be hard-pressed to find glaring criticisms with the game — other than the labor practices it was created under. This stunning creation of the American Wild West as the time of cowboys and outlaws was fading away runs at 4K on PS4 Pro with HDR support.

$36 at Amazon







Norse mythology: God of War
Kratos and Atreus became nearly everyone's favorite father/son duo after God of War released. Their journey is as harrowing as it is emotional, and it was beautifully captured in a game with impeccable gameplay mechanics to boot. On PS4 Pro, players can choose to either favor performance or resolution, whether you need the best visuals possible at checkerboarded 4K or want the game running at an unlocked frame-rate capped at 60FPS.

$20 at Amazon







Ancient Greek adventures: Assassin's Creed Odyssey
Ubisoft's latest historical venture thrusts players back into the middle of ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War. Sprawling city-states surrounded by imposing mountains and the Aegean sea can be viewed at a dynamic resolution on PS4 Pro, with the highest native resolution maxing at around 1620p. Just be sure to make good use of Odyssey's photo mode.

$37 at Amazon







Zombie Infected apocalypse: The Last of Us Remastered
Joel and Ellie's journey originated on PS3, but PS4 is where it found its new home. The Last of Us Remastered takes one of last generation's most highly-acclaimed games, and lets players choose from a variety of resolution, frame-rate, and shadow configurations on PS4 Pro. Enjoy it in stunning 4K at 30FPS or go for 60FPS at 1800p.

$23 at Amazon







Travel the world: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End
Nathan Drake's final adventure on the hunt for pirate Henry Avery's long lost treasure is best experienced on PlayStation 4 Pro. From the coastlines of Madagascar to the Scottish Highlands, everything looks beautiful at 1440p with HDR support, giving its colors more vibrancy and the resolution a crisp edge that wasn't present before.

$19 at Amazon







A galaxy far, far away: Star Wars Battlefront II
Say what you want about EA and Battlefront II's initial microtransactions, but it's actually not a bad game when you get past the controversy and focus on its actual content. Not only does it have several multiplayer game modes spanning the prequel trilogy all the way until the recent sequels, but it also has a dedicated single-player campaign. Star Wars Battlefront II runs at 1440p and 60FPS on PS4 Pro.

$13 at Amazon







A PS2 classic: Shadow of the Colossus
Shadow of the Colossus launched on PS2 but was rebuilt from the ground up specifically for PlayStation 4. The best way to experience this classic title is undoubtedly on PS4 Pro, which can render it at 4K running at 30FPS or 1080p at 60FPS. If you missed out on it over a decade ago, now's the time to pick it up.

$16 at Amazon







Web-slinging fun: Marvel's Spider-Man
Join your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man on his heroics through New York City in stunning 4K with HDR support on PS4 Pro. Insomniac absolutely knocked this one out of the park, and it may very well be one of the best superhero video games ever to release — it certainly gives the Batman Arkham series a run for its money.

$38 at Amazon

The cream of the enhanced crop
The best first-person game in a long time, Modern Warfare looks amazing enhanced on a PlayStation Pro. If you don't enjoy shooting games, you can't go wrong with God of War, with its compelling storyline and impressive dad beard.
Speaking of a compelling storyline, if you haven't tried The Last of Us enhanced for the PS4 you are missing out on one of this generations best games, the way it was meant to be seen.
PS4 enhanced games will likely become more common, and as we moved towards the PlayStation 5, 4K games will become the standard. Developers are likely to make more enhanced games to get ready for the PS5 launch. Look for more games in the coming months.
