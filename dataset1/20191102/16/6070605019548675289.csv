Families of prisoners for protests in the sentence demand immediate freedom and the filing of causes
Provisional prison for the detainee in Terrassa for the riots of the general strike

02 Nov 2019, 16:05

Families and friends of people in preventive jail for protests against the sentence of 1-O have called for ""immediate freedom"", the archive of ""all causes"" and the arrest of repression. "" They have claimed this in a joint manifesto that was read this Saturday in Plaça del Rei in Barcelona, at the same time that similar events took place in Lleida, Tarragona and Girona. In the manifesto they denounce that the ""Catalan people and from all over the State"" have received a ""furious repression"" by institutions that have the objective of ""frightening"" and ""silencing any type of claim.""
The defenders of the manifesto have denounced that in the last few weeks more than 200 people have been detained, some thirty, imprisoned and more than a thousand, injured, in protests by the sentence of 1-O. The relatives warn that this is the result of a ""repressive escalation"" to ""stop any type of mobilization"" and claim the ""condition of prisoners and political prisoners"" for more than 40 people deprived of freedom, among those convicted in the trial of the process, the detainees in the operation of September 23 and the protests after the sentence.
One of the people who took part in the event in Plaça del Rei, organized by families with the support of the Alerta Solidaria community, was Paula, who wanted to ""unravel a bit of the story that is being popularizing with regard to political prisoners. "" ""The messages of empowerment and hope that are generated from the interior of the penitentiary centers do not reflect the reality that is lived there and what we have suffered young people jailed these days,"" he said. And then he added: ""We can not forget the consequences that this generates in each person imprisoned and we have to fight until all are at home."" Thus, he asked not to ""romantize any imprisonment"": ""The prison determines you as a person and away from the environment.""
The companion of another detainee, Mario, explained how the arrest took place when they returned home. As he recalled, Mario had manifested himself against the ruling on October 16 and she, who was home, in Cerdanyola, was going to fetch him by car. When they were on their way back, agents who were not uniformed, on a motorcycle and a car, stopped them, without ""identifying themselves at any time"" and ""upsetting them"", it has related, as it collects the testimony that goes lend ""It had been about two hours or more since Mario had left the demonstrations until the moment of detention. They had been following him all the time,"" said his colleague, who spoke of ""institutional kidnapping"" And he has asked that this case, or any of the others, ""fall into oblivion"".
David Ros, uncle of one of the detainees on September 23, has denounced ""a whole series of irregularities"" in arrests, such as ""hindering"" legal assistance in most cases; the ""lack of information"" of their rights and the facts they were accused of; ""interrogation attempts during transfers"" or ""incomunication"": five of the detainees were unable to contact the lawyer until 30 hours after the arrest; in one case, after five days and in another, until the 23rd day.
He also criticized the coercion they say they received at the barracks and ""public criminalization"" with leaks to the media while lawyers have not yet been able to access the summary, although the secret was lifted last week. In addition, he regretted that the arrests caused ""from the first moment a lot of pain"" in children, couples, parents and siblings, that they ""had to live the threats of agents and the dismantling of their homes.""
Prison for another young person from Terrassa
On the same day as the relatives and friends of those imprisoned for the uprisings of last week, the judge ordered the jailed prisoner in Terrassa for the protests of the day of the general strike. The young man will be admitted this Saturday in a preventive prison after three days of arrest, according to the Alerta Solidaria organization at the end of the ceremony in Plaça del Rei in Barcelona and through his Twitter account. The National Police arrested him for attacking public officials, injuries and disorders, according to police sources told ACN Thursday. The group calling for the freedom of the prisoners has convened this Saturday evening in Terrassa a concentration of support.
