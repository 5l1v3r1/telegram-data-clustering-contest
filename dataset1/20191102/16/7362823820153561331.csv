Cleveland police have ruled out charges related to the September accident that killed the girlfriend of the Cleveland Browns defensive end Chris Smith, according to reports.
The person under investigation— a 47-year-old woman -- was cleared Friday, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.
Police said the toxicology tests showed the woman wasn’t legally drunk when she struck Petara Cordero with her Mazda on Sept. 11 on I-90, according to the paper. A police report said she had admitted drinking prior to hitting Cordero.

Cordero was standing outside Smith’s Lamborghini when she was hit and killed.
She and Smith had gotten out after the vehicle blew a tire and crashed into the center median. It happened around 2 a.m., police said.
