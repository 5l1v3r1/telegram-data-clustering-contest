      <p>UK Labour and the Lib Dems are accusing Boris Johnson of hiding a report, which exposes the scale of the threat from Russia to Britain's democracy.</p>
      <p>The British Prime Minister received the findings a fortnight ago, but hasn't allowed it to be published.</p>
      <p>Russia's previously been accused of attempting to disrupt foreign elections.</p>
      <p>Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who has seen the document, stressed its publication is essential ahead of the General Election, with it containing information “germane” to voters.</p>
      <p>UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested, however, that the report hasn't been published as the government want to delay it until after parliaments dissolution.</p>
      <p>"If the report has been called for and written and should be in public domain what have they got to hide?"</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson also called on the Government to stop “keeping it a secret”.</p>
      <p>Mr Grieve, chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee at Parliament, has accused the Prime Minister of sitting on the report ahead of the December 12 vote.</p>
      <p>The independent MP, who was exiled from the Tories by the PM over his no-deal Brexit opposition, is calling on the Conservative leader to publish the committee’s report before Parliament is dissolved on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“I cannot think of a reason why he should wish to prevent this report being published,” Mr Grieve told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p>
      <p>Asked if there is useful information in the report for voters, he said: “Yes I think there is. It’s about information. I want to emphasise I’m not about to explain what’s in the report, I’m not allowed to and I wouldn’t dream of doing so.</p>
      <p>“But the report is informative and people are entitled to information and it seems to us that this report is germane because we do know and I think it is widely accepted that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past.”</p>
      <p>The House of Commons was previously told the report was sent to the PM on October 17.</p>

      <p>A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “There are a number of administrative stages/processes which reports such as this – which often contain sensitive information – have to go through before they are published.</p>
      <p>“This usually takes several weeks to complete. The committee is well informed of this process.”</p>
      <p>But Ms Swinson called for urgency in the report’s publication.</p>
      <p>“I think this is a very serious issue. The idea that other countries meddle in our democratic processes is deeply worrying,” she told the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>“He (Mr Grieve) has seen it and he says this is something that should be published before we embark on an election and that makes perfect sense to me.</p>
      <p>“Because, if there is information that we should know about what has happened in previous democratic events and who has tried to interfere, the public has a right to know and the Government shouldn’t be keeping it a secret.”</p>
      <p>Parliament is expected to sit on Monday and Tuesday ahead of dissolution although proceedings could be brought to an end sooner, which may prevent publication.</p>
      <p>Commons Speaker John Bercow called on Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg to expedite the publication.</p>
