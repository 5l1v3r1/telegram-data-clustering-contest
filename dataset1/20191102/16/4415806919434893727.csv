Blindboy Boatclub wants Ireland to become a world leader on climate action
02 Nov 2019, 16:16 by By Digital Desk staff
Blindboy Boatclub believes that Ireland's ""cultural footprint"" can provide a springboard for climate action around the world.
Speaking on last night's Late Late Show, the popular podcaster called for the country to ""lead by example and change the world"" when discussing climate change.
The Rubberbandits star said that Ireland is in a position to enact global change through cultural means, saying that he is ""positive about the future"" despite the growing climate emergency.
""When I go on about climate, people always say, 'sure we're Ireland, we're tiny, we've a tiny carbon footprint, what's the point if we do anything?' and one thing I always like to remind people of is that our carbon footprint is tiny but our cultural footprint is massive.""
Expanding on that idea, Blindboy went on to say, """"We were the first to do the smoking ban and that was copied all around the world, we were the first to have the plastic bag tax and that was copied, St. Patrick's Day or Halloween, these are Irish holidays celebrated around the world – let's make St. Patrick's Day about the environment.
""Let's use our cultural footprint to lead by example and change the world.""
