      <p>November is already upon us and you surely know, what that means for all the chinese shops and sellers. Yes, the madness of Singles Day (aka 11.11 big sales event), when billions will flow and the shopping spree is going to be unimaginable. We still have few days to the peak of the craziness, but some shops are already starting with their promos and events. Favorite <a href="https://promotion.geekbuying.com/promotion/1111_sale?utm_source=gizchina.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=elaine&amp;utm_term=1111">Geekbuying e-shop</a> is no exception to this rule and you can already find some great deals and stock up with discount <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/coupons">coupons</a> for the main event.
