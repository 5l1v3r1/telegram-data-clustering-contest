Marc McKenzie produced the thrills to inspire Hurlford United to victory over Shotts in their Junior Cup replay yesterday.
The former Albion Rovers and Cowdenbeath forward set up two goals and hit the post himself as his side marched into the fourth round.
Goals from Chris Robertson and Lewis Morrison put the West Premiership big guns in control and while Jordon Love pulled one back, Jack Whittaker clinched it for the hosts in the second half.



Darren Henderson's outfit took the lead in the seventh minute with a goal which was straight from the training ground.
McKenzie delivered a pinpoint corner to the near post with Robertson rising to powerfully head high into the net.
 
It was 2-0 in the 16th minute with McKenzie surging into the box and cutting back for Morrison who provided a sure finish.
And Hurlford thought they had added a third five minutes later but Sean Faulds did brilliantly to clear Chris McKnight's header from another McKenzie corner off the line.



Shotts immediately cashed in following their reprieve with Love catching the 'Ford defence cold to slot home and reduce the deficit.
The Hannah Park hitman should have made it 2-2 four minutes later when he took the ball round keeper Martin McDonald but his final effort was off target.
Robertson netted for a second time in the 31st minute but his celebrations were cut short due to an offside flag which seemed harsh when reviewing video footage.



In the 41st minute, McKenzie whipped in a lovely cross for Morrison but the striker's header cannoned back off the post.
However, Hurlford's endeavour would be rewarded midway through the second half when ex-Kilmarnock youngster Whittaker curled a low shot from distance past Johnny Murdoch.
McKenzie hit the woodwork two minutes later as Hurlford looked to turn the screw and ensure there would be no repeat of last weekend when they squandered their advantage.
The West Championship side tried to set up a grandstand finish but Danny Burns was denied by McDonald when clean through before Faulds headed wide from the resulting corner as Hurlford's cup journey continues.
