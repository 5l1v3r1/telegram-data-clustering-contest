""Zebra"" will appear at the intersection of K. Marx and May Day. Local residents have long complained about the inability to cross the road safely.


For a couple of hours, the curbs were eliminated to create a pedestrian crossing

On the evening of October 30, at the intersection of K. Marx and Pervomaiskaya Streets in Berdsk, road workers removed the curb from two sides. A tractor with a bucket ripped curbs from the ground along the asphalt, plunging them into the KamAZ body.
For the duration of the work, the passage along the street was partially blocked. May Day, putting the appropriate sign on the strip leading in the direction of the Microdistrict. Transport moved in reverse mode. Signal tapes also indicated the place of repair on the sidewalks.
In the morning, sections of the road without curbs were completely freed from “construction debris,” including pieces of asphalt.
The Center for Municipal Services said that as part of the current maintenance of roads, he did not carry out repair work on the indicated section - not far from school No. 1. Clarity was brought by the vice-mayor of Berdsk for construction and municipal services Vladimir Zakharov.
- Make a pedestrian crossing. People need to somehow cross K. Marx Street. This makes housing management. We only deal with topical issues, - commented “Courier. Wednesday. Berdsk ”Zakharov, confirming that local residents have long complained about the impossibility of a safe transition.
It is no secret that the section of st. K. Marx from Pervomaiskaya to Suvorov motorists use as a backup option for fast travel bypassing the street. Lenin. At the same time, residents of several apartment buildings, whose entrances face directly on the road, run the risk of getting under the wheels. They have to wait a long time before the traffic flows.

Anonymous, November 03, 2019 11: 50 Yes, it’s not enough. The question always arose - who thought of making the transition not at the intersection, but simply to school. Apparently at that moment, someone from the administration went to school in that very place, so they did personal transition. And now the child has grown and his paths have changed. Therefore, they make the transition elsewhere. Probably now studying in a sharaga. And by the way - children, because of their infancy, do not drive, but walk on sidewalks. Let’s better then make sidewalks. Especially Suvorov-Krasnoarmeyskiy. It seems even under Stalin or Khrushchev built.
