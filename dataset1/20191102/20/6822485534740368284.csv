Alamodi: The media climate should not endorse people's qualifications

02 Nov 2019, 20:54

Wali Faqih representative in Khorasan-e-Razavi said: It is not right to disapprove of the provincial election monitoring commission authorized by the media outlets outside the province.
Ayatollah Seyyed Ahmad Alam al-Mahdi told members of the Khorasan Razavi Election Monitoring Board: ""The Provincial Election Monitoring Council and the Guardian Council have always been the target of enemy media attacks that should not back down.""
He said: The supreme leader of the revolution, who advocated maximal absorption and minimal repulsion, was addressed to individuals, not political currents because the currents have political affiliations and do not change their course, even by the Election Observation Board, as a means of achieving their goals. They are building.
He said that oversight committees could make a decision and role play in preventing enemy infiltration into the system, which would, in the short run, be effective in obtaining the consent of Imam Khomeini for a lifetime.
""We have a unique system in the world, the province has built a high wall for our country that the enemy cannot enter, but the wall has a big gate,"" he said. It is the gate of democracy and elections that has a guardian called the Guardian Council.
He said: ""The political process goes unchallenged to the end, and it never gets in the way of warmth and kindness. Some people are religious and revolutionary, but with a leadership angle, they are the first subject of enemy recruiting because the enemy first recruits from the angle with the leadership, so it is important for election observation committees to be more sensitive.
The head of Khorasan Razavi Election Observation Board also said: Each city has a three-person monitoring committee, one of which is nominated by the judiciary.
Mohammad Kamal Survey stated the candidates 'economic health assessment as one of the issues emphasized in the qualifications examination and added: In the candidates' qualifications the economic, rent and non-legal wealth issues will be considered.
The Chief of Justice of Khorasan Razavi and a member of the Election Observation Board of the province also said: ""The Guardian Council will do its job well, and we will see a healthy and efficient parliament.""
Gholamali Sadeghi added: ""The Guardian Council must come to the realization that not everyone can be satisfied and that the attacks against this council are increasing so that they must resist in order to have an efficient and revolutionary assembly.""
