      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Haley Myles' miracle cancer recovery is thanks to the generosity of Sunday People readers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:37:27+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author">Geraldine McKelvie</a></address>
      <p>The generosity of big-hearted Sunday People readers has given a mum the chance to watch her daughter grow-up, thanks to donations which paid for pioneering medicine.</p>
      <p>Just months ago, Haley Myles feared she wouldn’t live to see 18-month-old Ava bloom into a young woman.</p>
      <p>Haley, 26, had already defied the odds to give birth after an op left her with just a quarter of a womb.</p>
      <p>Then, in February, her world fell apart when medics diagnosed her with stage four cervical cancer. They had run out of treatment options.</p>
      <p>Incredibly Haley is now in remission after your donations helped fund a course of miracle drugs.</p>

      <p>Emotional Haley said: “I went for a scan and the doctor said ‘We can’t see any signs of cancer anywhere’.</p>
      <p>“It was surreal, I was in so much shock I didn’t cry. I just ran outside and gave my mum a huge hug.</p>
      <p>“I can’t thank Sunday People readers and everyone who donated enough. Their generosity has bought me a future with Ava. I just can’t put a price on that.”</p>
      <p>The Sunday People’s ­appeal saw readers help to raise £35,000, so Haley could have pioneering immunotherapy. </p>

      <p>The procedure trains the ­immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells. But research is at an early stage, so the drugs are not ­available to most on the NHS.</p>
      <p>Last month, Haley was given the news she and partner Ryan McShane, 27, had been waiting for.</p>
      <p>Haley, from Carluke, South Lanarkshire, said: “My family tried not to show their emotions, but Dad cried when I told him the cancer had gone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen him cry before.”</p>
      <p>Pharmacist Haley always longed to be a mum but struggled to conceive after being diagnosed with endometriosis, a uterus disorder.</p>
      <p>In excruciating pain, she made the decision to have a ­hysterectomy in February 2017, resigned to never ­conceiving naturally.</p>

      <p>But surgeons were unable to remove her whole womb and, five months later, she was stunned to learn she was ­pregnant with Ava.</p>
      <p>“Ava was my first medical ­miracle. Now I’ve had a ­second,” Haley said.</p>
      <p>She had several abnormal smear tests and was being checked every six months before her hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>But after ­giving birth in March last year, she stopped getting reminders – and now suspects they were sent to her old address.</p>
      <p>Haley started bleeding heavily when Ava was 10 weeks old and initially thought it was because of the birth. But the symptoms ­continued and she went for a smear test last June.</p>

      <p>It came back clear but her ­instincts screamed at her that something was still badly wrong.</p>
      <p>She paid for a private scan last September, when doctors broke the devastating news.</p>
      <p>Haley said: “It was a total shock to hear the word cancer. I phoned Ryan and burst out crying.”</p>
      <p>She was told radiotherapy was too much of a risk, as her womb op had left vital organs exposed.</p>
      <p>Instead, she had six rounds of chemo – but was left shattered in February, when she was told it had failed.</p>
      <p>Medics broke the news that Haley’s cancer was at stage four and had spread to her bowel, and there was nothing more they could do.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She said: “When you hear the words stage 4, you think, ‘I’m not going to be here, that’s it’. I asked the doctors, ‘What else is ­available?’ They told me I could try immunotherapy but couldn’t get it on the NHS.</p>
      <p>“That night, I was in so much shock I went to a birthday party and had a gin like nothing had happened.</p>
      <p>“The tears came after.</p>
      <p>“I thought about Ava, and how much that she needed me.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t bear the thought of missing her first day at school.”</p>
      <p>On average only a fifth of patients with stage four cervical cancer live more than five years.</p>
      <p>But reading about pioneering immunotherapy gave Haley hope.</p>
      <p>A University College London trial found a quarter of women either went into complete remission or had ­tumours shrink significantly after.</p>
      <p>The only stumbling block was the cost, as Haley discovered it came with a price tag of up to £50,000.</p>

      <p>Then concerned pals started a ­fund-raising page. Donations rolled in after we shared her plea for help in March. Soon, she had £35,000.</p>
      <p>Haley initially thought she’d have to travel abroad, but found a Glasgow ­clinic which could ­administer the drugs. Now, she is looking to the future.</p>
      <p>She and Ryan have booked their ­wedding for April 2021, and Ava was christened ­last month.</p>
      <p>She said: “These are the moments I thought I might not see. “It’s amazing to be able to look ­forward to things.”</p>
