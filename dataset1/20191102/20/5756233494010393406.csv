Sauron Coalition: We have many options to replace Abdul Mahdi

02 Nov 2019, 20:25


A senior member of the Sharon coalition called Abdul Mahdi's government ""failed"" and said there were ""many alternatives.""


Sunshine News:

Mohammad Reza al-Haider, a senior member of the Saeron coalition, stressed on Saturday his coalition positions, which are close to ""Sayyid Muqtada al-Sadr,"" over the removal of the Iraqi prime minister.
""There are many alternatives to Abdul Mahdi and, as Abdul Mahdi was nominated by the political movement for the post of prime minister, there are now alternatives,"" he said.
""Abdul Mahdi has not been able to carry out his plans for a full year until people have now taken to the streets,"" he added. So he has to step down and form a new government. ""
A senior member of the Saeron coalition stated that ""the partisanship of the Iraqi people has come to an end and much has changed.""
He noted that ""political parties in the new Iraqi government cannot impose any corrupt minister or person"".
In October, Iraqis protested the poor economic and livelihoods and corruption in the government but postponed the protests until the end of Arbaeen (October 3: November 3). The second round of protests began two weeks ago on Friday and continues.
