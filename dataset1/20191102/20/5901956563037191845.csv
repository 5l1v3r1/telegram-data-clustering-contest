Made in Mandell
The V85 TT guzzi motto belongs to the enduro motorcycle segment that has so far been missing from Guzzi's range; the rudder position is easy, which comes in handy for longer journeys.

Moto Guzzi is Europe's oldest motorcycle manufacturer, having been on the market for almost a century. It has been more than 95 years since the legendary brand was born today in 1921 by Carlo Guzzi, Giovanni Ravelli and Giorgi Parodi in the Italian Mandell del Lario near Lake Como. toothpicks or toothpicks, with his hands in his pocket after noon bone comes back to work. Chubs around, almost hills. They are brought to the shaft by top-mounted Fiat or three-wheeled cultivators driven by a two-cylinder air-cooled Guzzi unit. He is eternal and indestructible. He is like that from eternity and he is eternal himself. People there on the shores of Lake Como choose a technique that is durable and simple.
A gift of memory


The unit in Guzzi's manner is a good, old and reliable, transversely positioned four-stroke V-design.

The Moto Guzzi brand belongs to the Piaggio family, where they are aware of the need to nurture Guzzi's tradition and classic charm. In recent years, they have revamped the range of models, and these have impressed customers who are swearing at classic motorcycle looks and familiar techniques that are the same or at least similar for decades. This technique, for example, from the 1970s, does not mean anything bad, on the contrary, in the flood of soulless brands and the abundance of models on the market, there is even a trump card on which they bet in Guzzi. They added some modern technology to the classic frame, such as modern TFT displays that show all the information you need, engine modes, ABS and rear-wheel slip control, with more attention being paid to a higher level of workmanship. The Guzzi motto thus receives a touch of nobility, perhaps even exclusivity, otherness.
New travel motorcycle
All this is also true of the V85 TT, a brand new model in the Guzzi range that can be fitted into the classic enduro motorcycle segment that has been missing so far. For inspiration, the Italians have taken on the creation of Claudio Torri, who in 1985, with the enduro motorcycle V 65 TT, competed in the legendary Paris-Dakar rally. It is reminiscent of the red colored frame and yellow plastic fuel tank available on the V85 TT as one of the color combinations.
The seat is only 83 inches from the ground, which means it can also be driven by under-aged drivers and drivers.
Moderately laid back, bouncy and determined


A single exhaust gives a concrete sound.

Off-road motorcycling that overlooks the V85 TT has the rule that such a ready-to-ride motorcycle is highly planted. However, the new Guzzi does not fully apply, as the seat is only 83 centimeters off the ground, which means it can also be driven by underweight drivers. A wide handlebar with protective plastic at the ends ensures that the driver manages it, the weight ratio is balanced and 229 pounds is not really felt in the ride. The position behind the handlebars is easy, which comes with long journeys as well as off-roading. It impresses the TFT display in blue, which emphasizes the preciousness of the motorcycle, while proving that the V85, despite its inspiration from the 1980s, is a modern motorcycle. You can also think of a navigation that connects to your motorcycle screen via your smartphone. The unit in Guzzi's manner is a good, old and reliable, transversely positioned four-stroke V-design, in the spirit of modernity with three programs of operation. The driver can adjust and modify these by pressing the left and right sides of the handlebars.


The TFT display proves that, despite its inspiration from the 1980s, the V85 is a modern motorcycle.

The motorcycle is low-speed and low-speed, lean, rideable and quite responsive on the ground and on the road. Eighty horses are squeezed out of the mechanical lungs with a twisted lever of gas, a single sound through a single exhaust, and Bremb's brakes do a great job. With a traditional but proven technique, with modern additions of a somewhat robust design and with charisma, it will take over especially those who are fascinated by the golden years of motorcycle with a touch of nostalgia.
