Green politicians: death threats against Roth and Özdemir
02 Nov 2019, 20:18 by Euronews
Right-wing extremists have sent a green death threat to Green politicians Cem Özdemir and Claudia Roth. The party has since confirmed. The sender of the e-mails should be the group ""Nuclear Weapons Division Germany"".
Özdemir for a long time under police protection
The newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe quote from the letter in their possession: ""At the moment we are planning on how and when we will execute you, at the next public rally, or will you intercept us at your place of residence?""
The 53-year-old ex-Green leader Özdemir passed the mail to the Bundestag police and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). He has been receiving personal protection for some time. Roth told journalists: ""If you think you can dissuade us from your commitment to a diverse and cosmopolitan society with your dull hatred and history-blind hate speech, then I must bitterly disappoint.""
BKA determined
""Nuclear Weapons Division"" is actually a radical right-wing group from the US. This year leaflets of the group appeared in Frankfurt and Cologne, where violence is called. The BKA referred on Saturday to a response from the Federal Government to a request from the Left Group in July 2018.
It said that there was no evidence to suggest that the ""Nuclear Weapons Division"" was a terrorist organization. It was also said: ""The threat of extreme right-wing and right-wing terrorist acts in the Federal Republic of Germany, even after the announcement of the existence of a German offshoot of the AWD, remains at an abstract high level.""
