Apple TV + reaches the 'battle' of streaming, but falls short of 'weapons' to fight Netflix and Disney +
The service, opened on Friday, has an offer of digital content that looks small compared to what its rivals offer in the market.

The day arrived. Apple launched its original video streaming service on Friday, ending years of anticipation of the company's next act on television. But it will lack what many consumers want: a giant library of their favorite movies and shows.
Over the past decade, the iPhone manufacturer has explored the construction of its own television, buying large content firms such as Time Warner and partnering with cable companies. Instead, it landed with a combination of a video aggregation application, on-demand access to pay-TV channels such as HBO and Starz and a monthly $ 4.99 subscription service for original movies and television shows.
The subscription service is available on millions of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV in 100 countries, just days before the arrival of Disney + and months before the comparable services of Comcast and AT&T.
Apple TV + is currently focused on the original content, but the absence of a library of old fan favorites leaves the service behind its rivals.
The original content of Apple TV + includes less than 10 programs at its launch and a total of 15 of the first initial stage of the project. In contrast, Disney + is scheduled to begin on November 12 with 15 titles in its first round of originals.
Similarly, Peacock, from NBCUniversal de Comcast, will arrive in April 2020 with 16 titles, while AT&T HBO Max, which will launch in May 2020 with a $ 14.99 subscription, has dozens of original productions on the way.
Apple has said it plans to add new titles monthly to its service, which means that the $ 4.99 subscription will increase over time. Still, many people subscribe to major video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video primarily for their gigantic content catalogs.
""The number of streaming homes that go out of their way to subscribe to Apple TV + will be quite limited initially due to limited content,"" according to Michael Olson, a Piper Jaffray analyst who covers Apple and Netflix.
Olson said a survey of 1,500 Netflix subscribers found that 23 percent would subscribe to Apple's offer and that interest is ""moderate, not overwhelmingly high,"" partly due to limited content. Streaming services generally begin with a subsequent catalog to ""create a first interest"" before ""transitioning"" to the original content, he added.
Apple TV + is part of the company's strategy based in Cupertino, California, to generate more revenue from services and provide new ways to keep its loyal customers tied to the iPhone. The services generated sales of $ 12.5 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last year, the company said Wednesday.
Apple is driving its video service as it does with its devices: broadcasting commercials during the main hours of cable television, placing fences in the main cities and showing the next programs on its website and social networks.
The company has clearly created enough awareness to quickly gain subscribers and Apple is doing something it has rarely done in the past: allow the service to work on third-party devices such as Samsung televisions and Amazon decoders, which gives it a greater base of potential customers.
The concern about the lack of a catalog of repetitions and old movies is not trivial and will make it difficult for Apple to compete completely. Disney + will be released with The Simpsons and hundreds of Disney movies; HBO Max will have hit movies like Shark and Erin Brockovich and famous series like Friends and The Big Bang Theory. Netflix has established successes like Seinfeld and, until it goes to Peacock, it has The Office, in addition to an estimated catalog in more than 2,700 movies and 1,500 programs. Amazon, which also competes with Apple on consumer devices, has hundreds of old movies to stream on its Prime Video service.
Netflix and Amazon Prime have been building their original content libraries for years, but they also started with scarce choices, which included only a few original programs. Today, it is estimated that Netflix broadcasts more than 1,200 original titles.
On the other hand, Disney, NBC and HBO services also have the advantage of having 'giant content arms' within their own companies, something that Apple lacks. While Apple has thousands of movies and TV shows available on iTunes for single-download purchases or rentals, it has not shown a willingness to turn those offers into a subscription component for TV +.
Advocates point out that Apple's service was not designed with a subsequent catalog of programs in mind, but with a price a few dollars below services such as Netflix, with giant libraries, consumers may overlook the lack of favorites.
With its pricing strategy, Apple has shown that it recognizes the limitations of the service. At $ 4.99, it costs much less than Apple Music, Apple News + and the company's main cloud storage offer, and to an unprecedented extent for Apple, it is included free for one year with any purchase of a new device.
By necessity, it is also much cheaper than most of its rivals, although HBO Max will also be free for some AT&T subscribers. Apple CEO Tim Cook explained Wednesday that the service is priced at $ 4.99 per month to encourage as many subscribers to register as quickly as possible. And, in a rare statement, the company said the service and pricing strategy would be irrelevant, at least initially, for its financial results.
So far, reviews of Apple's first list of original programs indicate why content accumulation is so important. Variety called The Morning Show, a series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, as ""streaming failure"" and Hollywood Reporter said See, starring Jason Momoa, ""is not close to being a good show.""
Even so, Apple is confident that its service will be good enough for its loyal users to pay for it within a year, and even if the company can get only a quarter of its new iPhone buyers to register after one year. , Apple TV + will be a multi-million dollar addition to its growing arsenal of services.
