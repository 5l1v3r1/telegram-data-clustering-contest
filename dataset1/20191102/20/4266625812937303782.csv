Naftogaz sends new claims against Gazprom to Stockholm Arbitration

02 Nov 2019, 20:13


NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy sent new claims against Gazprom to the Stockholm arbitration. A decision on this arbitration is expected to be taken in 2021.

This was written by the Executive Director of NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy Yuriy Vitrenko on Facebook.
“It is our turn to file a Defense Statement and counterclaims.” The number of pages of the main text of our application alone exceeds 500. Attached are 3 reports of international experts that have been specially developed for this. Also included are witness statements and a bunch of other applications. We worked actively on these documents for about three months. In more detail about our claims, as well as why Gazprom’s claims are unfounded, I will write a little later, ”wrote Yuriy Vitrenko.
Vitrenko recalled the background of this lawsuit: on April 18, 2018, Gazprom appealed to the Stockholm arbitration with a demand to start an arbitration to review the decision of the previous arbitration under the transit contract.
“From a formal point of view, Gazprom requires amendments to the contract, because Gazprom believes that the transit contract imposes unreasonably excessive obligations on Gazprom. This is Gazprom’s contractual obligation to supply at least 110 billion cubic meters for transit. m per year. The financial effect is approximately $ 6 billion.
Naftogaz appealed to the arbitration on July 6, 2018 with a request to review the transit tariff, which is valid from March 13, 2018 (the date of contacting Gazprom to revise the tariff) until the contract expires (January 1, 2020) and compensation for Gazprom's failure to fulfill obligations transit of at least 110 billion cubic meters per year starting in 2018 (over the past years, compensation has already been awarded by a previous arbitration decision).
As with the revision of the tariff, as well as compensation for short deliveries, we are talking about the consequences of the actions of Gazprom itself. That is, here we are actually defending ourselves and demanding compensation for losses caused by Gazprom’s actions. The financial effect is more than 12 billion dollars, ”wrote Yuri Vitrenko.
According to him, on September 6, 2018, the Stockholm Arbitration Court decided to consolidate the production of Gazprom’s circulation and Naftogaz’s conversion to one production.
“On September 21, an arbitration tribunal was formed, which is considering this case. On February 25, the procedural schedule was approved. In accordance with this schedule, Gazprom filed a “Statement of Claims July 14, 2019”. Now it’s our turn to file a Statement of Defense and counterclaims, ”Vitrenko said.
He noted that the number of pages of the main body of the statement from Naftogaz alone exceeds 500 pages. Attached are 3 reports of international experts that have been specially developed for this. Also included are witness statements and a bunch of other applications. We worked actively on these documents for about three months.
“In compensation for our losses, according to the decision of the previous Stogkolmsk arbitration, we actually received gas worth more than $ 2 billion delivered by Gazprom to Ukraine and the proceeds from the sale of which were actually paid to the state budget as taxes and dividends to Naftogaz. Gazprom still remains guilty of $ 3 billion. We expect that we will recover this debt in 2020. And in 2021 we are counting on a decision on a new arbitration, ”Vitrenko said.
Recall, on October 9, in Stockholm, the court of appeal began hearings on the decision of the Stockholm arbitration, which rejected the requirements of the Russian Gazprom to Naftogaz Ukrainy under a gas supply contract.
