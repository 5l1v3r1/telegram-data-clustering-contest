      <p>Pink Sweat$ has returned to share his latest "I Wanna Be Yours" track, bringing in the assist from South Korean singer Crush. Per usual,you'll find a stripped-down backdrop as a minimal drum loop and acoustic guitar characterize the track's foundation while Pink and Crush swap off on their fair share of smooth vocals and falsettos.</p>
      <p>The new selection arrives ahead of the Pink Sweat$'s <i>Pink Planet</i> debut. The Philadelphia crooner has not yet attached the effort to a set release date, however when speaking with Zane Lowe, he described the coming project as a "high-end convenience store." Get into the R&amp;B crossover below.</p>

      <p>Honey won’t you come with me <br/>I’ll make sure you get all your diamond rings <br/>Right here is where I wanna be <br/>We’re floating on the wings of timeless love</p>
