      <p>Aston Villa fans have been full of praise for Mahmoud Trezeguet for his performance in the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool at Villa Park today.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's European champions inflicted a second defeat in row on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> after the 3-0 loss at Manchester City last time out.</p>
      <p>The Reds went 1-0 down thanks to a strike from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/trezeguet">Trezeguet</a>, who volleyed in from John McGinn's cross for his first goal since his £9 million move from Turkish side Kasimpasa in July.</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane turned the game around for Liverpool, netting in the 87th and 94th minutes respectively <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-player-ratings-liverpool-17191100">to secure a big three points for their side</a> that leaves them top of the League and six points clear of City.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Trezeguet drew plenty of praise for his maiden strike on social media but his all-round performance was also commented upon.</p>
