Landmine kills nine children in Afghanistan

KUNDUZ (AFP) - A landmine explosion killed nine children in northeastern Afghanistan on Saturday, an official said, amid an increase in civilian casualties in the long-running and brutal war.
The blast happened in volatile Darqad district of Takhar province, when the children stepped on a mine that had been planted on a road in a Taliban-controlled village.
""At 8:30am (0400 GMT) this morning, tragically, nine schoolchildren were martyred in a landmine blast planted by the Taliban,"" Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the Takhar provincial governor, told AFP.
He said the children -- all boys -- were aged from seven to 11.
No group claimed responsibility for the blast, and the Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, the United Nations released a report saying an ""unprecedented"" number of civilians were killed or wounded in Afghanistan from July to September this year.
The figures -- 1,174 deaths and 3,139 injured from July 1 until September 30 -- represent a 42 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
The UN laid most of the blame at the feet of ""anti-government elements"" such as the Taliban, who have been carrying out an insurgency in Afghanistan for more than 18 years.
In May, a landmine killed seven children and wounded two more in the southern province of Ghazni.
A month earlier, seven children were killed and 10 more wounded in the eastern province of Laghman when a mortar shell exploded while they were playing with it.
The insurgents often use roadside bombs and landmines to target Afghan security forces, but the lethal weapons also inflict casualties on civilians.
Years of conflict have left Afghanistan strewn with landmines, unexploded mortars, rockets and homemade bombs -- and many are picked up by curious children.

The court determined a preventive measure to the people's deputy Dubnevich
02 Nov 2019, 20:23 by Correspondent.net
The deputy’s defense declared his innocence and asked not to take any preventive measure to him. Dubnevich himself previously stated that he did not intend to make a deposit.
The Supreme Anti-Corruption Court decided to refuse to impose a preventive measure in the form of detention of the people's deputy Yaroslav Dubnevich and assigned a security deposit in the amount of 100 million hryvnias, Interfax-Ukraine reports on November 2.
Making a deposit is possible on a special account during the validity of a court order - five days. The court ordered Dubnevich to pass passports and wear an electronic bracelet.
The deputy’s defense declared his innocence and asked not to take any preventive measure to him. Dubnevich himself previously stated that he did not intend to make a deposit.
The prosecutor's office noted that the deputy faces a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. In addition, the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office notes that NABU is investigating other criminal proceedings against the people's deputy.
Dubnevich is suspected of a criminal offense under Article Assignment, embezzlement of property or seizure of it by abuse of official position.
According to the SAP, Dubnevich used his status as a deputy and head of the parliament’s transport committee to conspire with the leaders of enterprises allegedly controlled by him to receive undue profit of more than 93 million in a deal with the supply of components for Ukrzaliznytsia.
On October 31, the Verkhovna Rada withdrew the immunity from Dubnevich and allowed him to be prosecuted.
