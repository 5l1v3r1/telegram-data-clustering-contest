      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Heavy winds are battering parts of England and the stormy weather has forced the suspension of ferry service between the major ports of Dover and Calais, France.</p>
      <p>Police reported one fatality when a woman in her 60s died after a tree fell on her car in Dorset, 120 miles (193 kilometers) southwest of London. The woman has not been identified.</p>
      <p>Britain's Met Office forecasting service Saturday issued a number of rain and wind warnings across the south of England and Wales and warned of heavy rain in northern Scotland.</p>
      <p>Officials say gusts of more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour were measured Saturday and that numerous trees had been blown down, blocking some train lines.</p>
      <p>Ferry operators say heavy winds are preventing ships from entering or leaving the harbor in Dover, Britain's main passenger link to continental Europe.</p>
      <p>South Western Railways says some of its services could be delayed or cancelled because of the heavy winds.</p>
