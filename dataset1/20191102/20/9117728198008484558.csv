Horner looks ahead to qualification: ""The car behaves well here""
02 Nov 2019, 20:22 by Matt Gretton

Christian Horner, boss of Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, is feeling confident ahead of qualifying because he insists his teams' F1 car ""behaves well"" at the COTA. The Brit feels the RB15 can compete with the Ferrari and Mercedes during the all-important Saturday session. 

Max Verstappen recorded the fastest time during the third and final practice session of the weekend. Unsurprisingly so, Horner was pretty pleased with the result and is confident Red Bull can replicate the feat. 



“It was a solid session. Ferrari and Mercedes were a bit more on the attack, but the car behaves quite well here,"" Horner told Ziggo Sport. 
He hints that the warmer temperatures played a role in this: ""It was a little warmer today, so let's see what happens at four o'clock.""
