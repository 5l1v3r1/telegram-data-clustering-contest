The England camp have not drafted in a replacement as they hope Denly could still recover in time for the two-match test series against New Zealand, which begins at Mount Maunganui on Nov. 21.
""He will now start a rehabilitation programme and will be routinely assessed ahead of the two-match test series against the Black Caps,"" the ECB said in a statement https://www.ecb.co.uk/england/men/news/1477587/injury-update-joe-denly.
Denly endured a mixed home Ashes series against Australia, scoring 312 runs in five tests, notching up three half-centuries in the last three matches.
The second of the five T20 matches between the two teams will be played in Wellington on Sunday.
