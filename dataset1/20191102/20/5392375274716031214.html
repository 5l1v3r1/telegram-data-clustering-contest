      <p>Nokia 2.3 (TA-1206) appears online – shows colour options<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Finnish manufacturer, HMD Global, seems to be preparing a successor to the recently released Nokia 2.2. According to a distributor database, Nokia is preparing a new smartphone – Nokia 2.3. The name of this device suggests that it is the successor to the Nokia 2.2. The Distributor database shows that the Nokia 2.3 smartphone comes with model number “TA-1206”. In addition, it will be available in three colours which include “Sand”, “Cyan Green” and “Charcoal” (maybe brown, turquoise or black). Nokia 7.2 was the first Nokia phone to leak in the Distributor database, and the leak information was very reliable.</p>
