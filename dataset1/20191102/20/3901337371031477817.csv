Gareth Bale, Nacho and Marco Asensio remain the only absentees for Los Blancos, who will come up against a Betis side high on confidence.
Betis got back to winning ways a few days ago with a 2-1 triumph over Celta Vigo, ending a four-game winless run in the Spanish top flight.
The Lilly Whites can take confidence from the face that they secured three points the last time these two sides met in league football, although Los Blancos claimed victory in the reverse fixture.

Here's how they line up:

Real Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Ramos, Varane, Mendy, Kroos, Casemiro, Modric, Hazard, Rodrygo, Benzema.
Real Betis: Joel, Emerson, Mandi, Feddal, Sidnei, Moreno, Bartra, Guardado, Canales, Fekir, Loren.
