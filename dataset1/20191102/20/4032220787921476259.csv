అమరావతి: విశాఖలో జనసేన లాంగ్‌మార్చ్‌పై వైసీపీ ఎమ్మెల్యే అమర్‌నాథ్‌ విమర్శలు గుప్పించారు. జనసేన అధినేత పవన్‌కల్యాణ్ ఎప్పుడూ ఏ విషయంలో లాంగ్‌ మార్చ్‌ చేయలేదన్నారు. దత్తత తండ్రి కోసం పవన్‌ లాంగ్‌ మార్చ్ చేసి గందరగోళం సృష్టించవద్దని హితవుపలికారు. ఇసుక కొరత ప్రకృతిపరంగా వచ్చిన సమస్య అని ఇది శాశ్వతం కాదన్నారు. లాంగ్‌మార్చ్‌లతో ప్రజలను తప్పుదోవ పట్టించవద్దని అమర్‌నాథ్‌ సూచించారు.
