      <h1>Benetton's good early-season form continues against Edinburgh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-02T20:53:22+00:00">02 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Edinburgh fell to a battling 18-16 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/connacht-too-strong-for-ospreys-in-guinness-pro14">Guinness PRO14</a> losing bonus-point defeat as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton">Benetton</a> claimed back-to-back home victories at Stadio Comunale di Monigo.</p>
      <p>Jayden Hayward got the hosts off to a flying start in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy">Italy</a> when he collected a neat chip from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/tommaso-allan/">Tommaso Allan</a>, which he converted, to put Benetton 7-0 ahead after just four minutes.</p>
      <p>Jaco van der Walt landed a penalty two minutes later to get <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> on the board before Allan restored the seven-point advantage with a kick of his own.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh produced a brilliant full-length try when wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/damien-hoyland/">Damien Hoyland</a> made a line-break and offloaded to Mike Willemse, who immediately passed to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/mark-bennett/">Mark Bennett</a> on the halfway line.</p>
      <p>The outside centre attempted a grubber kick through but the ball ricocheted off the boot of Benetton wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/iliesa-ratuva/">Iliesa Ratuva</a> Tavuyara and into the hands of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/edinburgh/players/luke-crosbie/">Luke Crosbie</a> for the flanker to crash over and make it 10-10 after 18 minutes.</p>

      <p>Prop Jamie Bhatti was sin-binned for a tackle off the ball in the 34th minute and Benetton instantly took advantage of the numerical advantage with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/tomas-baravalle/">Tomas Baravalle</a> crossing the whitewash.</p>
      <p>Allan missed the conversion and van der Walt reduced the arrears to 15-13 with his second penalty with the final kick of the first half.</p>
      <p>The torrential rain continued to force mistakes from both sides, with van der Walt converting his third penalty in the 44th minute as Edinburgh got their noses in front.</p>
      <p>Allan split the posts 15 minutes later to nudge the Italian outfit back into a lead which would not be overturned, with the Italy international fly-half missing one penalty and opposite number van der Walt dragging two match-winning kicks wide in the final 20 minutes.</p>
