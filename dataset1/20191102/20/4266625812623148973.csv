On the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language, a traditional dictation of unity will take place

02 Nov 2019, 20:28


Ukrainian Radio will hold an annual action ""All-Ukrainian Radio Dictation of National Unity"" dedicated to the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language.

It is reported by Osvita.
According to the report, the dictation will be held on November 8, 2019 at 11:00. The text of the radio dictation will be read live by the famous linguist, author of textbooks and manuals on the Ukrainian language and literature, Alexander Avramenko, who has been composing the text of the dictation for the last 13 years. This year, the author will add several elements to the text to check the new edition of the current spelling.
In the reading room of the National Library. Vernadsky will be written by a dictation by invited guests - politicians, celebrities, and journalists.
This year, for the first time, the dictation can be checked already 15 minutes after its writing. During this time (11: 45-12: 00), everyone will be able to send their text (photo, scan or screenshot with the indicated return address) to the email of Ukrainian Radio (rd@nrcu.gov.ua), or to private messages on the Ukrainian page Radio on Facebook (RU: Ukrainian Radio), or on Viber - 097-107-107-9. They note that the message must be sent to one of the addresses without duplicating everything.
Authors of infallible dictations will receive incentive prizes. Additionally, a competition will be announced for the best works on writing a dictation (for those who prefer traditional correspondence). A work with a dictation must be sent by mail within 2 days (until November 11) to the address: 01001, Kiev, Khreshchatyk, 26 (marked ""for competition""). 10 best works will be awarded incentive prizes.
From 12:00 to 12:15 on live Ukrainian Radio Alexander Avramenko will work on the bugs.

Reference.

The All-Ukrainian Radio Dictation of National Unity was established in 2000 with the aim of uniting around the language. Since then, annually, listeners, and more recently, viewers (the action is broadcast by the UA: First channel) can take part in writing a dictation and check how well they know the language. They write a dictation outside of Ukraine. Last year, 32,779 dictations were received by Ukrainian Radio. Of these, 311 participants wrote without errors.
