Heavy winds batter England; some ferries to France suspended
02 Nov 2019, 20:42 by EndPlay
LONDONÂ (AP) - Heavy winds are battering parts of England and the stormy weather has forced the suspension of ferry service between the major ports of Dover and Calais, France.
Police reported one fatality when a woman in her 60s died after a tree fell on her car in Dorset, 120 miles (193 kilometers) southwest of London. The woman has not been identified.
Britain's Met Office forecasting service Saturday issued a number of rain and wind warnings across the south of England and Wales and warned of heavy rain in northern Scotland.
Officials say gusts of more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour were measured Saturday and that numerous trees had been blown down, blocking some train lines.
Ferry operators say heavy winds are preventing ships from entering or leaving the harbor in Dover, Britain's main passenger link to continental Europe.
South Western Railways says some of its services could be delayed or cancelled because of the heavy winds.

At least 15 people killed in a bomb explosion in northern Syria

02 Nov 2019, 20:20


The explosion of a car bomb in the center of the northern Syrian city of Tall Abjad killed at least 15 people on Saturday. The city has recently been under the control of Turkish troops.

Thirty others were injured. Hospital sources report this.
The explosion took place at a gas station. According to sources, the car was packed with explosives.
Most wounded are cared for in Turkish hospitals just across the border, because there are not enough facilities in the city itself. Since the start of the Turkish offensive in the region, tens of thousands of people have fled from Tall Abjad.
It is still unclear who is behind the attack. Turkey accuses the Kurdish militia YPG.
In recent weeks, various bombers have been deployed in attacks in the region.
