Nearly 20,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow today in a demonstration in support of Scotland's independence from Britain. Nicola Sterzon, head of the Scottish Government and the Scottish National Party (SNP), has been present at this gathering for the first time in five years. ""An independent Scotland is closer than ever. It's really a breath away, ""Sterzon said in a statement released hours before the Saturday demonstration. On Friday, Scotland's first minister announced he would call for a new independence referendum before the end of December. Referring to the early parliamentary elections on 12 December, he said that ""it is Scotland's opportunity to save Brexit and put our future in our own hands"", calling on voters to support the SNP to strengthen that position. In the first Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, 55% of voters voted against. In the 2016 Brexit referendum with a clear majority (62%) the Scots were in favor of staying in the European Union, and many are relying on this fact to call for a new referendum on independence.
