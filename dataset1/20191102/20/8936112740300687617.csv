'Straight Into Donald Trump's Arms': Jeremy Corbyn Exposes the Pitfalls of 'No-Deal' Brexit

02 Nov 2019, 20:01


Commenting on Trump’s stance on UK domestic politics, Corbyn also noted that he is concerned about the relationship between the US government and the Tory party and its potential impact on British public services.

UK Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn delivered a fresh verbal jab against US President Donald Trump after the latter claimed that Corbyn’s victory at the upcoming general election would be bad for the country.
Having previously claimed that Trump is attempting to interfere in the British electoral process and trying to get ""his friend Boris Johnson"" elected, Corbyn revealed how the so called ""no-deal"" Brexit scenario might also help Trump’s agenda, according to the Daily Mail.
""We said no to no-deal, because Boris Johnson, Farage and all the others, with their threat of no-deal, the reality of no-deal is straight into the arms of Donald Trump"", he declared. ""Straight into the arms of a free trade deal with the USA, with their powers of investor protection and their desire to take over our public services. We will not go down that path under any circumstances, our public services, our NHS, is not for sale to Donald Trump or anybody else"".
Speaking during a campaign rally in Swindon, Corbyn noted that if Trump ""isn't pleased at the prospect of a Labour government being elected in Britain"", then he’s ""entitled to his choice,"" adding that he’s willing to speak with Trump in order to discuss his stance on climate change policies.
""Well it's a very odd thing to do and I don't personally do personal, and leave those matters to Boris Johnson and Donald Trump"", he added. ""But I'm much more concerned about the relationship of the Tory party with the US government and the US on our public services. And the deals they've been apparently prepared to do with US pharmaceutical companies for our NHS. I want our NHS to be ours, publicly owned and publicly run. And that's exactly what will happen with a Labour government"".
Corbyn’s remarks come following Trump’s interview with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage on Britain’s LBC radio earlier this week, when the US president claimed that the Labour leader would be “bad” for the UK, while calling Prime Minister Boris Johnson a ""fantastic man who was right for the times.""

Black clouds over Bayern's coach. ""I know how this business works""

It was a very sad afternoon for everyone associated with Bayern Munich. A 1: 5 defeat in Frankfurt can be fatal, especially for coach Niko Kovac. However, he believes that, like last season, he will be able to lift the team out of the crisis.



The matches of the German league can be watched on the ELEVEN SPORTS channels on Player.pl. The debate about the future of Kovac in Bayern has lasted almost since the middle of the previous season, and now critics have got a serious argument to strike the Croatian coach even more. Why did he change the tactical setting? Why did Thomas Mueller play on the wing, who never looked good in this position? Why did he make such and no other changes with an unfavorable result? Questions can be multiplied and multiplied.
- I do not know. You probably know better than me. I should know after the match? Anyway, what I think is irrelevant. The question should be directed to those who make decisions - Kovac told reporters the question of what to do with his work in Bayern.
He won't give up
- I don't remember losing as high as a coach. I know how this business works. I am not naive. However, in the previous season we were in a similar situation and we got a doublet. I didn't give up then and I won't give up now. I never give up - stressed the 48-year-old.
What did the Croatian say about the meeting itself? Little. Although his team had to play in weakness from the 9th minute, the coach is not going to look for excuses.
- What do you want to know? We got a red card and lost. There is no room for any excuses. After eight minutes, everything collapsed. Although we were losing 0: 2, we presented ourselves well before the break. After the break we lost another goal after four minutes. It does not change the fact that the 1: 5 defeat should not have happened, it is sad and very unpleasant for us - he explained.
- I will say again that in the second half we played badly. The red card is a decisive factor, but we certainly didn't help our game. We've made too many mistakes. We lost the ball around our sixteen, then we backed up too slowly. These are simple mistakes for which we were immediately punished - he added.



This is not Estonia, it is Eintracht
Manuel Neuer, a Bavarian goalkeeper, was in a bad mood after the meeting. No wonder - he had to pull the ball out of the goal five times. He referred to the October match between Germany and Estonia, in which he saved the team several times from losing a goal after evident defensive gifts. In addition, Estonians were struck by inefficiency.
- It's no miracle, it just happened. The red card didn't make the task easier for us, but we can't lose five goals, we lack defensive stability - he admitted.
""If we didn't get the card, we probably wouldn't have to talk that way now."" However, we did not play with Estonia, but with Eintracht Frankfurt - stressed the goalkeeper, who added that the next days at Saebener Strasse will be ""very busy"" in his opinion.
After ten matches of Bundesliga, Bayern ranks 4th in the table with 18 points. Four points will hit the leading Borussia Moenchengladbach.
