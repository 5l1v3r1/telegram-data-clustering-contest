Lady Gaga will once again be the protagonist, this time as the murderer of Maurizio Gucci
After the success she obtained with her role in 'A Star is Born', the singer will be part of the film by Ridley Scott, who will talk about the death of the businessman.

Lady Gaga will give life on the big screen to Patrizia Reggiani, who was convicted of ordering the murder of her ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, a prominent family member who created the famous Italian fashion brand, who was shot by a hitman on March 27 of 1995 in front of the portal of his company in Milan (Italy).
Reggiani, who always defended his innocence, was sentenced in 1997 to 26 years in jail, but an Italian court decreed his freedom in 2017.
Maurizio Gucci was a grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of Gucci, and directed the mark from 1983 to 1993. His murder caused shock in Italian society and the subsequent trial received great coverage from the media.
The Gucci movie will feature a screenplay by Roberto Bentivegna and will be based on the book ‘The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamor, and Greed’ by Sara Gay Forden.
Scott (the director), whose last film released to date is 'All the Money in the World' (2017), is scheduled to shoot the tape 'The Last Duel' with actors Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Jodie Comer and Ben Affleck
When the ‘The Last Duel’ project ends, the British filmmaker will begin the production of the Gucci feature film.
This movie (still without a title) will be Lady Gaga's first film project after the applause she reaped with ‘A Star is Born’, a new reinterpretation of this classic Hollywood story that, on this occasion, she directed and co-starred Bradley Cooper.
Lady Gaga won the Oscar for the best original song for ""Shallow"" and was nominated for the best actress figurine, which was taken by Olivia Colman for ‘The Favorite’.
The singer was also one of the great protagonists of the last Oscar ceremony thanks to an impressive live performance of ""Shallow"" with Bradley Cooper.
