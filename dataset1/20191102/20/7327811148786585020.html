      <p>CLAREMONT, Bronx (WABC) -- Police are searching for two suspects who burst into an apartment in the Bronx, tied up two people inside and shot one of them. But police say the home invasion may have been a mixup.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at about 5 a.m. Friday in the vicinity of Washington Avenue and Morris Avenue in the Claremont section.</p>
      <p>According to the NYPD, the men entered the apartment through an unlocked kitchen window, displayed firearms, threw a 32-year-old man to the ground and shot him in the left shoulder.</p>
      <p>They then bound the man and a 30-year-old woman who was also inside the apartment.</p>
      <p>The two ransacked the apartment.</p>
      <p>The man was treated for his gunshot wound at a local hospital. The woman was not hurt.</p>
      <p>Police say one suspect was seen carrying a blue umbrella and wearing all dark clothing. The second man was last seen wearing a black jacket with white stripes on the sleeves.</p>
