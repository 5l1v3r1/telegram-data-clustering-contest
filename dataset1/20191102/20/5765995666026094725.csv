Elton von Costume shocked: ""Where in Germany right wind reigns ...""

02 Nov 2019, 20:17

Trouble with influencer post! Moderator Elton is actually known as a little political joker. The now 48-year-old became famous in 2001 as a sidekick by show legend Stefan Raab. In his TV Total show, Elton appeared for years as a ""show intern"". But even after Raab's retirement, Elton remained in business, moderating shows like ""Beat the Best"" or ""Beat the Star."" Now the otherwise so funny Elton gives insight into his soul life.

On Instagram and Facebook, he denounced the costume of a German influencer - she had dressed for Halloween in the US as Adolf Hitler. And for Elton, the fun stops here: ""I rarely open a barrel, but this story makes me really speechless and a little angry.""
Elton stinksauer: ""A scandal""
Especially in the current time, such a costume is particularly tasteless, so Elton.
------------------------
This is moderator Elton:

His real name is Alexander Duszat
Elton was born in April 1971 in West Berlin
Later, his family moved to Hamburg
Elton graduated from secondary school and then completed a training as a radio and television technician
Later he went to the radio and from 2001 on was seen as a sidekick by Stefan Raab in ""TV Total""
Until the end of the show in 2015, he performed there again and again
Meanwhile, Elton moderates regular shows on ProSieben but also in the ARD
He is married since 2003 and has two children

------------------------
""But presenting myself as a"" monster ""in a low-cut costume, blamed for the deaths of millions of people, is a scandal. Right now, where a real wind is blowing in Germany and racism seems to be ""normal"" thanks to the AFD. ""The AFD has celebrated spectacular success in several elections this year, especially in the state elections in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.
The costume can not be justified by the fact that it is a deliberate taboo break or a tribute to Charlie Chaplin. In 1940 Hitler had targeted him in his film ""The Great Dictator"" by parodying Hitler in the role of ""Anton Hynkel"".
Elton: Fans share his opinion
""I can not blame anymore what happened then. But I can respectfully treat all the victims and descendants of the victims, ""says Elton, shocked.

""The man has millions of people on his conscience ... not just Jews, homosexuals, political dissidents or people with disabilities ... no ... also every person who was injured or killed in the war (whether German or from another Country). My grandfather for example !!!! ""
His fans agree with Elton:

Well written Elton is in your opinion
Totally agree. It's sad and unbelievable enough what happened back then
Class written, dear Elton. I think it's great that you are taking a stand and your opinion is very clear. I am very clear your opinion.

Which internet star is it all about? Which influencer had dressed up like that, Elton did not want to say. He was primarily concerned with the matter - less about the person (fel)
