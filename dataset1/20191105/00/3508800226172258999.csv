賣座與否誰能預料？文創市場需求不確定的風險與機會
05 Nov 2019, 00:13 by 巷仔口社會學


我們想讓你知道的是若能跳脫規避風險、只求安全的形式窠臼，更大膽的實驗和創新，所推出令人耳目一新的作品，說不定也可撥動閱聽人的心弦，讓「對，這就是我想要的」需求之聲在他們耳邊響起。



文：李令儀（中央研究院社會學研究所）
今年春夏以來，全球影迷間討論度最高的電影，莫過於漫威影業（Marvel Studio）出品的超級英雄系列《復仇者聯盟4》，不但票房一再刷新紀錄，也贏得影迷的口碑。類似《復4》這樣集結暢銷原著、大卡司、大製作、廣大漫威迷和系列續集等諸多條件的作品，看似就是掛保證的賣座片，然而，高成本的大製作電影要賣座真有這麼理所當然？去年「星際大戰」系列外傳電影《星際大戰：韓索羅》，就是現成的反例。《韓索羅》不但登上娛樂新聞網站The Wrap「2018 十大電影票房毒藥」排行榜，也未能守住「星戰迷」的基本盤，成為歷年來賣座最差的星戰系列電影。
《韓索羅》一片慘賠，印證了文化創意產業相關研究所關注的一項特性：「需求不確定」（demand uncertainty）。《韓索羅》就像《復仇者聯盟4》一樣，幾乎齊備了所有賣座元素：好萊塢大導、大卡司、大玩特效以及系列續集，但是電影公司不惜重本一再追加預算，票房卻遭遇滑鐵盧，反而賠得更慘。然而，《韓索羅》並非大製作票房毒藥的特例，前幾年同屬漫威漫畫改編的《驚奇四超人》，也是以慘賠做收。為什麼電影公司原本信心滿滿，不惜砸下鉅資，卻只能在上市後才發現壓錯寶？這就回到好萊塢流傳的一句名言， “Nobody Knows Anything!” 亦即，電影會不會賣座，事先沒有人料想得到。在經濟學家Richard Caves看來，這句話意味著，即使製片和片廠主管對過去電影如何賣座知之甚詳，但他們在新電影計畫的初期，對最後商業成果的預測能力仍趨近於零。對文創產品的成敗，事先「沒有人知道」，這種特性也可說是文化創意市場的「不可預測性」（unpredictability），或是需求面的不確定性。



消費者的偏好難以捉摸
文創產品的這項特性，首先源自於消費者變幻莫測的品味和偏好。文創產品畢竟不是一般生活必需品，沒有既定的市場需求，即使產品大獲成功，也很難說是它們滿足了某些消費者的需求。著名的例子是1970年代在美國廣受歡迎的布偶秀《大青蛙劇場》。美國CBS電視網當初接到這齣布偶劇的提案，他們的研究中心經過市調後回應說，市場對一齣由青蛙主持的節目「沒有需求」，提案人只好將計畫轉交給一家獨立製作公司。但後來證明這隻柯米蛙卻成為全球知名、老少咸宜的「主持人」。CBS總裁Sagansky有句名言： “All hits are flukes”，意思約莫就是「所有火紅的劇都是矇到的」！以此看來，柯米蛙的故事也非特例。



另一方面，文創產品也可說是一種體驗性產品（experience good），且買方對產品的評價主觀，難以預期。美國出版研究者Albert N. Greco討論過新書上市時會遭遇到的「雙向不確定性」，或可說明這類產品面對市場時的挑戰。以Greco的觀察為例：每本書都是一種全新的產品，因而從開發端來看，直到書稿付印的前一刻，作者和編輯仍很難準確預知這本書能否獲得讀者青睞；在消費端，除非讀者親自翻讀一本書，他也無法百分之百預知這本書是否合自己的胃口。就是這種「雙向不確定」，使得出版社和編輯每推出一本新書，都是一次賭注。
以「賭博」來比擬文創產業的投資和產製，不僅只是譬喻而已。早在1972年提出需求不確定性概念的社會學家Paul M. Hirsch即注意到，文化產品的成功與否沒有一定公式，由於對暢銷公式的精確組成成分高度不確定，成本回收也不確定。從前述幾個例子來看，一旦生產者對市場預期過於樂觀，或是「一時腦熱」不計成本盲目加碼下注，等到產品上市後才發現消費者不買單或口碑不佳，最後落得血本無歸、慘賠收場，也只能願賭服輸。這種不確定性和生產者需承擔的風險，也成為文創產業的特徵之一。
管理不確定性
因而這一產業最大的挑戰，即是如何因應市場反應難以預測所帶來的高風險，也就是要想辦法降低、控制或管理需求不確定性。最常用的因應方式之一就是超額生產（overproduction），最常見於出版、音樂、獨立電影等產業。由於產品所需的製作技術相對便宜，成本較為低廉，生產端會盡可能開發多樣品項，以截長補短；因為這些產品的銷售一旦打平成本後，就開始賺錢，暢銷或熱賣後的營收更為可觀，通常一項單品的獲利就足以彌補先前其他滯銷品的虧損。英國社會學家J. B. Thompson將出版業的這種因應策略稱為「青蛙下蛋模式」（frog model），也就是盡量多出書，且兼顧多樣的類型，希望其中有些書能順利孵化為蝌蚪，「長大成蛙」，甚至能搖身一變，成為會下金蛋的金雞母。
然而，需要大成本、大製作的文創業諸如表演藝術或電影等，由於製作時間長、投入的固定成本高，單以類似「蛙卵戰術」分散風險的做法顯然不夠有保障，因而這類組織發展出更多策略，以管理這類不確定性所帶來的風險。根據Terry Flew所歸納，創意產業用以降低不確定性最常採用的幾個策略，包括「明星系統」，也就是透過演員、作家、音樂家等明星，他們通常擁有死忠的支持者，帶動的「粉絲經濟」【註】也相對穩定；或是透過「文類」（genre）吸引固定的分眾，例如鎖定推理小說、奇幻或科幻劇或嘻哈音樂，不同類型的產品可能各有其穩定的支持者；另外就是打出知名導演、劇作家、製作人的名號，他們靠著過去作品在業界或閱聽人心目中累積出一定的聲望（reputation），掛上他們大名的作品猶如得到品質保證；再不濟也可靠著模仿成功作品，讓想要趕流行的閱聽人買單。
以此看來，類似復仇者聯盟這樣的續集故事，整合了包括明星系統、文類、模仿等不同策略，也就成為電影業管理不確定性的慣用做法。學者Michael Pokorny等人蒐集好萊塢1988年到2015年超過四千部電影的資料，分析發現，在2000年以後，續集是影業獲利最重要的來源之一。難怪「哈利波特之母」 J. K. Rowling的小書《怪獸和牠們的產地》，改編電影上映見好後即決定「小品大作」，宣布推出五部曲；電視產業也不遑多讓，播出八年八季的《冰與火之歌：權力遊戲》，最終季尚未完結前，ＨＢＯ電視台已迫不及待宣布要推出前傳衍生影集。



不管是透過模仿、固守文類或是推出續集，文創產業為了降低風險所採用的這些策略，說穿了不過就是一些商戰手法，或許可以立於不敗之地，卻不能維護創意。雖然在文化創意或藝術世界中，市場成功和品質、創意本就不能劃上等號，但是產業界若只為了擔心虧損而猛打安全牌，一味操作明星系統、耍弄文類、模仿或自我重複，不但新的創作類型或新人難以出線，市場上也可能堆積許多了無新意的作品。
或許你說前述例子大多集中在娛樂產業，但即使在一般人心目中最強調藝術性的古典音樂界，也有曲目僵化的現象。由於多數聽眾習慣聽熟悉的樂曲而非陌生的曲目，多數音樂會或錄音寧願選擇經典曲目，而較不願嘗試當代作曲家的作品，使得當代作曲家不但演出機會少，經濟條件也較差，競爭對手還是像巴哈、貝多芬這樣作古已久、不用收版稅的超級「大咖」。這樣看來，倘若從藝術到娛樂產業都這樣保守行事，打著「創意」名號的文化創意產業，可能愈來愈難找到生猛原創的創意。
但情況或許並非全然悲觀。回到「賭博」的比喻，若把文創投資視為一種賭注，「押對寶」也還是有機會翻本。不少編輯人就常以「中樂透」比擬出到暢銷書的「爽」。正是因為閱聽人的品味難以預測，有些原本不受業界看好的作品也可能成為「黑馬」，帶來驚喜。例如《哈利波特》第一集《哈利波特與神秘的魔法石》出版前，曾多次遭出版社退稿，當初英國Bloomsbury出版社決定簽下這本書後，第一版也才印了一千本，編輯還曾勸作者Roling最好還是找份正職，因為他覺得Roling靠寫童書是賺不了錢的。結果證明，編輯的判斷完全失準，原本出版社為鼓勵新人，帶有贊助意味的小額投資，沒想到卻賺到一本席捲全球的超級暢銷書。
是風險也是機會
類似《哈利波特》這樣的例子提醒我們，需求不確定雖讓產製者面臨風險，但同時也帶來機會。電影和音樂產業也不乏類似的故事，鬼才導演昆汀塔倫提諾、《水行俠》導演溫子仁，當初也是以低成本但風格獨特的獨立電影驚艷好萊塢；台灣搖滾樂團包括「伍佰與China Blue」、「五月天」、「蘇打綠」等也是發跡於地下音樂。甚至有業者已想到辦法抓住消費者對文創商品的這種「不確定感」，轉化為行銷手法。
例如日本東京的「梟書茶房」發想了讓讀者找到「命運之書」的點子，在店中以專區陳列沒有封面、找不到標題，而是以統一書套包起的書，希望「讓選購圖書的顧客沒有先入為主觀念、憑直覺的找到命運中的一本書」。國內的悅知文化出版社最近在連鎖書店推出的「覆面書」企劃，也有類似的概念，他們在書店櫃位立牌中的文案寫著：「編輯的真心話 VS. 讀者的大冒險」，這種被稱為「神秘行銷」的手法，不就是巧妙抓住讀者「碰運氣」、「我賭」的心理，把風險轉化為商機？






前述幾個例子讓我們看到，不同創作者以新文類、新概念或創新的敘事手法「小兵立大功」，也讓我們看到，文創產業並不是靠砸大錢式的密集資本，就能穩操勝券；相反地，不受看好的新秀、低成本的「素人」作品也可能成就「以小搏大」的戰果。由此，可以扣連上法國社會學家Pierre Bourdieu在《藝術的法則》一書中所提到的兩種經濟邏輯。
Bourdieu分析小型前衛出版社Les Editions de Minuit和大型出版社Laffon的選題和出版策略，發現代表法國出版業兩種極端的這兩家出版社，有著截然相反的生命週期，各自對應著對立的兩種經濟觀點或經濟邏輯。像Laffon這樣擁有700名員工的大公司，為應付固定成本和資本回收的問題，必須快速翻轉資本，並以縮短生產週期、安全的投資決策、高行銷成本的宣傳方式，追求短期的商業獲利。
相反的，Les Editions de Minuit這種不到十人的出版社，行銷預算低，且有近半數的書一開始賣不到五百本，則是要靠長期的經營，累積出在業界的聲望、讀者的認可與崇敬（也就是「象徵資本」[symbolic capital]），從而透過「放長線釣大魚」的方式回收成本。Les Editions de Minuit做為法國「新小說」的根據地，它的前衛體現在選題時的冒險精神上。代表性的一例是《等待果陀》，這本書可說是該出版社的台柱，它的長銷支撐了其他新書的虧損；但作者貝克特（Samuel Beckett）的小說在出版前可說是到處碰壁，《等待果陀》之前的兩本小說在獲得Les Editions de Minuit慧眼賞識之前，甚至曾遭別家出版社退稿編輯痛批：「根本就是胡扯，一點都不好玩。」（不知道聽到貝克特得諾貝爾文學獎時，這位刻薄的編輯有沒有從椅子上跌下來。）
前面已經提到，在文化和藝術的世界中，市場成功並不能證成作品的品質和美學價值，Bourdieu的洞見提醒我們，文創組織「炒短線」和「放長線」的兩種經營策略，可以說是處於不同的向度（用 Bourdieu 的術語來說，是屬於不同的次場域），短期、立即可見的市場成功是前者的主要目標，後者卻是以品質和價值贏得長期的生存。對文創產業而言，最可貴的也就是作品中的原創、新穎、突破性甚至是劃時代的嘗試。就好比貝克特的小說，最初並不見容於主流文學圈，但卻拓展或推進了文學藝術的創新，樹立新的創作語言和里程碑。
由此，我們可以正視需求不確定性為產業帶來的機會。若能跳脫規避風險、只求安全的形式窠臼，更大膽的實驗和創新，所推出令人耳目一新的作品，說不定也可撥動閱聽人的心弦，讓「對，這就是我想要的」需求之聲在他們耳邊響起。畢竟說到底，文化創意作品最終的成敗，事先還是「沒有人知道」！

Who can expect to sell a seat? Risks and opportunities for uncertain needs in the market
05 Nov 2019, 00:13 by Xiangzikou Sociology


What we want you to know is that if you can evade risk, just seek a safe form, bolder experiments and innovations, and launch a refreshing work, you may also be able to listen to the heartstrings of the people. Yes, this is what I want. The voice of demand sounds in their ears.



Text: Li Lingyi (Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica)
Since the spring and summer of this year, the most highly discussed movie among global fans is the superhero series ""Avengers 4"" produced by Marvel Studio. Not only has the box office repeatedly set records, but also won the fans' reputation. Similar to ""Re-4"", such works as the best-selling originals, big cards, big productions, vast Marvel fans and series sequels, etc., seem to be the guarantee of the blockbuster. However, the high-cost big production movie has to sell. So take it for granted? Last year's ""Star Wars"" series of essays ""Star Wars: Han Solo"" is a ready-made counterexample. ""Han Solo"" not only boarded the entertainment news site The Wrap ""2018 Top Ten Box Office Poisons"" list, but also failed to hold the ""Star Wars fans"" basic disk, becoming the worst-selling Star Wars series movies over the years.
""Han Solo"" was a disappointment, confirming one of the characteristics of the research institutes related to the cultural and creative industries: ""demand uncertainty"". ""Han Solo"" is like ""Avenger League 4"", almost all the elements of the blockbuster: Hollywood guide, big card, big play special effects and series sequel, but the film company spared no expense to increase the budget again, the box office encountered Waterloo, but lost even worse. However, ""Han Solo"" is not a special case of the big box office poison. In the past few years, the ""Amazing Four Superman"", which was also adapted from Marvel Comics, was also compensated for by the tragedy. Why is the film company originally full of confidence, and he will not hesitate to spend huge sums of money, but can only find the wrong treasure after listing? This is back to a famous saying in Hollywood, ""Nobody Knows Anything!"" That is, the movie will not sell, no one wants to get it beforehand. In the opinion of economist Richard Caves, this sentence means that even if the directors of film and film factories know how to sell the movies in the past, they still have the ability to predict the final business results in the early days of the new film project. Nearly zero. For the success or failure of Wenchuang products, ""no one knows"" in advance, this characteristic can also be said to be the ""unpredictability"" of the cultural and creative market, or the uncertainty of the demand side.



Consumer preferences are elusive
This feature of Wenchuang products is first derived from the unpredictable tastes and preferences of consumers. After all, Wenchuang products are not ordinary necessities, and there is no established market demand. Even if the products are successful, it is hard to say that they meet the needs of some consumers. A famous example is the popular puppet show ""The Big Frog Theater"" in the United States in the 1970s. The US CBS television network received the proposal of the puppet show. Their research center responded after the market transfer that the market had no demand for a program hosted by the frog. The sponsor had to hand over the plan to an independent company. Production Company. But it turned out that this Ke Mi frog has become a ""host"" of the world's well-known, young and old. CBS President Sagansky has a famous saying: ""All hits are flukes"", meaning that ""all the fiery dramas are all received""! From this point of view, the story of Komi Frog is not a special case.



On the other hand, Wenchuang products can also be said to be an experience product, and the buyer's evaluation of the product is subjective and difficult to predict. American publishing researcher Albert N. Greco discussed the ""two-way uncertainty"" that new books will encounter when they go public, or may explain the challenges faced by such products in the face of the market. Take Greco's observations as an example: each book is a brand new product, so from the development side, it is difficult for the author and the editor to accurately predict whether the book will be favored by readers until the book is printed. On the consumer side, Unless the reader personally reads a book, he can't predict 100% whether the book suits his own appetite. It is this ""two-way uncertainty"" that makes it a bet for publishers and editors to launch a new book.
It is not only a metaphor for comparing the investment and production system of the cultural and creative industry with ""gambling"". Sociologist Paul M. Hirsch, who proposed the concept of demand uncertainty as early as 1972, noticed that there is no formula for the success of cultural products. Because of the high uncertainty about the precise composition of the best-selling formula, cost recovery is uncertain. From the above-mentioned examples, once the producers are too optimistic about the market expectations, or ""a moment of brain heat"" blindly overweight the bet regardless of the cost, after the product goes on the market, it is found that the consumer does not pay the bill or the word of mouth is not good, and finally it is bloodless. If you return to the scene, you will only be able to gamble and lose. This uncertainty and the risks that producers have to bear have also become one of the characteristics of the cultural and creative industry.
Management uncertainty
Therefore, the biggest challenge of this industry is how to deal with the high risk caused by the unpredictable market reaction, that is, to find ways to reduce, control or manage the uncertainty of demand. One of the most common ways of coping is overproduction, most commonly in publishing, music, independent film and other industries. Since the production technology required for the product is relatively cheap and the cost is relatively low, the production side will develop as many sample items as possible to cut off the length; because the sales of these products will start to make money once they are flattened, after selling or selling. The revenue is even more impressive. Usually, the profit of a single item is enough to make up for the losses of other previously unsalable products. British sociologist JB Thompson called the publishing industry's response strategy ""frog model"", which means that as many books as possible, and with a variety of types, I hope some of them will be able to incubate smoothly."" Growing up into a frog, you can even change into a golden chicken that will lay golden eggs.
However, large-cost, large-scale entrepreneurial undertakings such as performing arts or movies, due to long production time and high fixed costs of input, it is obviously not guaranteed to spread risks in a similar way to ""frog egg tactics"". Develop more strategies to manage the risks of such uncertainty. According to Terry Flew, the creative industry's most commonly used strategies to reduce uncertainty, including the ""star system,"" through actors, writers, musicians, and other stars, often have supporters of diehardness. The ""fan economy"" [Note] is also relatively stable; or through the ""genre"" to attract fixed audiences, such as locking mystery, fantasy or science fiction or hip hop music, different types of products may have their own stability. Supporters; the other is to name famous directors, playwrights, and producers. They rely on past works to accumulate a certain reputation in the minds of the industry or the listeners. Hanging up their famous works is like obtaining quality assurance; If you are not good, you can also imitate successful works, and let the readers who want to catch up with the popular ones pay.
From this point of view, a sequel story like the Avengers Alliance, which integrates different strategies including star system, genre, and imitation, has become a common practice for film industry management uncertainty. Scholar Michael Pokorny and others collected data on more than 4,000 movies from 1988 to 2015 in Hollywood. The analysis found that after 2000, the sequel was one of the most important sources of profit for the film industry. No wonder ""Harry Potter's Mother"" JK Rowling's little book ""Monsters and Their Origins"", adapted to the film's release, decided to ""small pieces"", announced the launch of the five-part series; the TV industry did not give up, broadcast In the eight seasons and eight seasons of ""Song of Ice and Fire: Game of Thrones"", before the final season is over, HBO TV can't wait to announce the launch of the predecessor's derivative album.



Whether it is through imitation, sticking to the genre or launching a sequel, these strategies adopted by the Chuangchuang industry to reduce risk are just a few commercial methods, perhaps in an invincible position, but can not maintain creativity. Although in the cultural and creative world, the market success and quality, creativity can not be equated, but if the industry only hits the safety card to worry about the loss, blindly operate the star system, juggling the text, imitating or repeating itself. Not only new types of creation or newcomers are difficult to qualify, but there may also be many unproductive works on the market.
Perhaps you said that most of the above examples are concentrated in the entertainment industry, but even in the classical music world that emphasizes the artistry in the minds of ordinary people, there is also a phenomenon of rigid music. Since most listeners are used to listening to familiar music rather than unfamiliar tracks, most concerts or recordings prefer to choose classics, and less willing to try contemporary composers' works, so that contemporary composers not only have fewer opportunities for performance, but also have poor economic conditions and competition. The opponent is still a super ""big coffee"" like Baja and Beethoven, which has been used for a long time without royalties. In this way, if the art and entertainment industries are so conservative, and the cultural and creative industries with the name of ""creative"", it may become increasingly difficult to find original and original ideas.
But the situation may not be entirely pessimistic. Going back to the metaphor of ""gambling"", if you consider Wenchuang Investment as a kind of bet, ""Bet on the treasure"" still has the opportunity to turn it over. Many editors often use the ""Chinese Lotto"" to compare the ""sweet"" of the best-selling book. It is precisely because the taste of the listeners is difficult to predict, and some works that were not optimistic about the industry may also become ""dark horses"" and bring surprises. For example, Harry Potter's first episode, Harry Potter and the Mysterious Sorcerer's Stone, was repeatedly rejected by the publisher. After the British Bloomsbury Press decided to sign the book, the first edition was only Printed a thousand copies, the editor also advised the author Roling to find a job, because he felt that Rolling could not make money by writing children's books. The results proved that the editor's judgment was completely inaccurate. The original publishing house encouraged a new person, with a small investment of sponsorship, but did not expect to earn a super bestseller that swept the world.
Is risk and opportunity
An example like Harry Potter reminds us that uncertainty in demand puts producers at risk, but it also presents opportunities. There are also similar stories in the film and music industry. The director of the genius Quentin Tarantino and the director of ""Water Man"", Wen Ziren, also surprised Hollywood with a low-cost but unique style of independent film; Taiwan Rock Band includes ""Wu Wei and China Blue ""Mayday"" and ""Soda Green"" are also recorded in underground music. Even some operators have come up with ways to seize the consumer's ""uncertainty"" about Wenchuang products and turn them into marketing techniques.
For example, the ""Suishu Tea House"" in Tokyo, Japan, has thought of letting readers find the ""book of destiny"". In the store, there is no cover on the special area, no title can be found, but a book wrapped in a unified book cover. Customers who buy books have no preconceived ideas and intuitively find a book in their destiny."" The domestic Fujitsu Culture Publishing House recently launched a ""cover book"" project in a chain bookstore. There are similar concepts. The copywriting in the bookstore counter is written: ""The true words of the editor vs. the reader's big adventure"", This kind of technique, called ""mystery marketing"", is not to cleverly grasp the psychology of readers' ""take a chance"" or ""I bet"" and turn risks into business opportunities.






The above examples let us see that different creators use new genres, new concepts or innovative narrative techniques to ""small martial arts"" and let us see that the cultural and creative industries are not relying on large capital-intensive capital. On the contrary, the unfamiliar rookie and low-cost ""Amateur"" works may also achieve the ""small fight"". Thus, the two economic logics mentioned by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu in the book ""The Law of Art"" can be detained.
Bourdieu analyzed the selection and publishing strategies of the small avant-garde publishing house Les Editions de Minuit and the large publishing house Laffon, and found that the two publishers representing the two extremes of the French publishing industry have diametrically opposite life cycles, each corresponding to the opposite two. An economic point of view or economic logic. Large companies with 700 employees like Laffon must quickly flip capital in order to cope with fixed costs and capital recovery, and pursue short-term commercial profitability by shortening production cycles, safe investment decisions, and high marketing costs. .
On the contrary, Less Editions de Minuit, a publishing house of less than ten people, has a low marketing budget, and nearly half of the books sold less than 500 copies at the beginning, relying on long-term management to accumulate reputation in the industry. The recognition and reverence of the readers (that is, ""symbolic capital""), so as to recover costs through the ""long-line fishing big fish"" approach. Les Editions de Minuit is the base of the French ""new novel"", and its avant-garde is reflected in the adventurous spirit of the topic. A representative example is ""Waiting for the Goda"". This book can be said to be the pillar of the publishing house. Its long sales support the loss of other new books; but the novel by Samuel Beckett can be said to be everywhere before publication. In the face of the wall, the two novels before ""Awaiting the Fruits"" were even praised by the editors of other editions before they were praised by Les Editions de Minuit. ""It is simply nonsense, it is not fun at all."" When the Beckett won the Nobel Prize in Literature, did the mean editor fall from his chair.)
As mentioned above, in the world of culture and art, market success does not prove the quality and aesthetic value of the work. Bourdieu's insight reminds us that Wenchuang organizes two strategies of “short-term” and “long-term”. It can be said that it is in a different dimension (in the terms of Bourdieu, it belongs to different subfields), short-term, immediate market success is the main goal of the former, while the latter wins long-term survival with quality and value. For the cultural and creative industry, the most valuable is the original, novel, breakthrough and even epoch-making attempts in the works. For example, Beckett's novels were not initially seen in the mainstream literature circle, but they expanded or promoted the innovation of literature and art and established new creative languages and milestones.
Therefore, we can face the opportunities brought about by the uncertainty of demand. If you can get rid of risk, just seek a safe form, bolder experiments and innovations, and launch a refreshing work, maybe you can also listen to the heartstrings of people, so ""Yes, this is what I want."" The voice of demand sounded in their ears. After all, in the end, the ultimate success or failure of cultural and creative works is ""no one knows"" in advance!
