      <p>Washington Nationals pitcher and World Series MVP <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stephen-strasburg/">Stephen Strasburg</a> issued his first tweet in 18 months to call out “fake news” after a now-viral video appeared to show him snubbing President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Trump</a>’s handshake during his team White House visit on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stephen-strasburg/">Mr. Strasburg</a> retweeted a 10-second clip that showed him concluding his speech at the White House and then seemingly ignoring <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a>’s extended hand.</p>
      <p>The clip, posted by Twitter user <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-gersten/">Rudy Gersten</a>, titled, “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stephen-strasburg/">Strasburg</a> left <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Trump</a> hanging,” has racked up more than 2 million views.</p>
      <p>“#FakeNews,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stephen-strasburg/">Mr. Strasburg</a> wrote above the retweeted video.</p>
