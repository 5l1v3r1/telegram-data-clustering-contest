      <p>The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd may introduce new securities in the derivatives market in February 2020 as the market regulator’s six-month ban on the NSE expired on 31 October 2019.</p>
      <p>About 10-14 securities could be included if they meet the eligibility criteria for trading in the futures and options market, according to reports by Edelweiss Research and ICICIDirect Research.</p>
      <p>NSE has not introduced any new scrip in F&amp;O in the last couple of years. It had announced on April 30, 2019, three stocks for inclusion in F&amp;O viz. <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-housing/pnbhousingfinance/PHF">PNB Housing Finance</a>, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software/mphasis/MB02">MphasiS</a> and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/computers-software/larsentoubroinfotech/LI12">Larsen &amp; Toubro Infotech</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/javascript:;">Close</a>
      </p>
      <p>However, it withdrew the circular on May 29, 2019. Thus, expecting a timeline for the new inclusion may not be feasible.</p>
      <p>“We believe the upcoming Nifty rebalancing may be a trigger for the inclusion of a few stocks in the F&amp;O segment. Stocks that are not in F&amp;O may not be part of Nifty. The next Nifty rebalancing will be announced in February 2020. We can expect an announcement of stock’s inclusion in F&amp;O in the current calendar year,” ICICIDirect Research said in a note.</p>
      <p>From a data perspective, the brokerage firm believes that stocks that are likely to qualify for F&amp;O inclusion include names like SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard, Bandhan Bank, Avenue Supermarts, HDFC AMC, Godrej Properties, Info Edge, Oberoi Realty, and Reliance Nippon.</p>

        <b>Futures &amp; options contracts may be introduced on new securities, which meet the below-mentioned eligibility criteria, subject to approval by SEBI.</b>

      <p>3) The market-wide position limit in the stock shall not be less than Rs 500 crore on a rolling basis. The market-wide position limit of open positions (in terms of the number of the underlying stock) on futures and options contracts on a particular underlying stock shall be 20 percent of the number of shares held by non-promoters in the relevant underlying security i.e. free-float holding</p>
      <p>4) The average daily delivery value in the cash market shall not be less than Rs 10 crore in the previous six months on a rolling basis.
