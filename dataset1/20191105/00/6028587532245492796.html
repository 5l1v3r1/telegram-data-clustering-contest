      <p>Do you dream of saying “I Do” with a view of snowy mountains in the background or plan on a holiday destination wedding on sunny shores? No matter where you are tying the knot, getting married during the winter months is romantic and special. It also means that you need to consider the season and its many charms when choosing a gift for your groom. Traditionally given on the morning of the wedding, your groom’s gift can be as simple or as extravagant as you want it to be.</p>

      <p>Do you long to give your groom a classic and elegant gift? These Versace Medusa cufflinks are both extravagant and practical. Medusa is the fashion house’s iconic mascot, representing the Gorgon who made men fall in love with her with no way of turning back. As your groom is entering into marriage and making the ultimate commitment, the symbolism behind these cufflinks is a fun touch, too. Versace’s signature Greco-Roman pattern can be seen on the edge of the cufflinks, with a black enamel background and the Medusa emblem in the center.</p>
