Billionaire GOP Donors Predict Stock Market Drop If These Democrats Win

Topline: With the 2020 election growing ever nearer, several billionaires—mostly Republican—are predicting what will happen to the stock market, which recently hit new record highs, based on different 2020 election outcomes—especially if more progressive Democratic candidates win the election and are able to enact proposed wealth taxes.

Elizabeth Warren winning the 2020 election would cause the S&P 500 to tank 25%, mainly because of concerns over her proposed wealth tax, according to billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who cited an internal survey at his hedge fund. Billionaire Leon Cooperman, who has recently been locked in an ongoing feud with Warren, similarly predicts a 25% drop if she gets elected. Steve Cohen, another hedge fund billionaire, forecasts the S&P 500 to fall between 10% and 15% should Warren get elected.
Bernie Sanders gaining the presidency would cause a “more extreme” market selloff of 20%, according to Cohen. Jones also sees markets plunging 20% on this news, while Cooperman predicts a similar effect to Warren—a 25% drop. Earlier this year, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller forecast an even bigger drop, of 30% to 40%, if Sanders gets elected.
Joe Biden getting elected, on the other hand, would only result in a 10% drop, as he is more centrist than either Warren or Sanders, according to Jones. 
Pete Buttigieg winning the election would also only cause markets to fall 10%, Jones says, while also admitting that “Mayor Pete” is his favorite candidate.
Donald Trump securing a second term would lead to another 15% rally for the stock market, Jones also predicted. Many other economists, including Yale’s Robert Shiller, have agreed that the bull market could last longer if Trump gets reelected. Trump himself has predicted an epic stock market crash if he loses in 2020.

Big numbers: Paul Tudor Jones has a net worth of $5.1 billion, while Leon Cooperman is worth $3.2 billion, Steve Cohen is worth $13.6 billion and Stanley Druckenmiller is worth $4.7 billion, according to Forbes estimates.
Chief critic: While billionaires—and much of Wall Street—seem to be most afraid of a Warren presidency, that would actually not hurt markets as much as everyone thinks, according to David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies. “People forget she’s not that different from Obama. If you put the two of them side by side in 2007, they had very similar agendas—healthcare, regulation and financial, and energy and environment. From 2009 going forward, when Obama took office, we never looked back. The stock market just rallied,” he told CNBC.
Tangent: While it’s still too early for most political prognostication to begin, major economic forecasters are predicting Trump will easily win reelection in 2020, barring a major economic downturn. Moody’s analytics projects the president will win by a landslide 332 electoral votes, while Oxford Economics sees Trump winning 55% of the popular vote next year.
