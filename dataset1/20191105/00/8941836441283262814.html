      <p>BEIRUT (AP) - Lebanese troops are deploying in different parts of the country to reopening roads and main thoroughfares closed by anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>In many areas, protesters withdrew peacefully as the troops moved in. But in Beirut’s northern suburb of Zouk Mosbeh, a scuffle erupted on Tuesday when some demonstrators refused to move away and were forcefully removed from the main highway linking Beirut with northern Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Several protesters were detained by troops. One protester, an older man, fainted and was rushed away in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Anti-government protesters have been holding demonstrations since Oct. 17, demanding an end to widespread corruption and mismanagement by the political class that has ruled the country for three decades.</p>

        <p>The protesters have paralyzed the country by closing roads inside cities as well as major highways in Lebanon.</p>
