      <p>Pollution levels in Delhi are expected to drop on November 5 due to an increase in wind speed.</p>
      <p>This, even as the air quality index (AQI) remained in the 'very poor' category in the morning.</p>
      <p>There is a possibility of strong winds in the next 24 hours, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).</p>

      <p>At 9.44 am, Delhi's AQI was recorded at 365. The AQI at Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar and ITO were registered at 410, 395 and 382, respectively.</p>
      <p>On November 4, the city's average AQI stood at 370 at 8.30 pm due to a slight increase in wind.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category.</p>
      <p>In the National Capital Region (NCR), AQI in Noida was registered at 388, followed by Ghaziabad (378), Faridabad (363) and Gurgaon (361).</p>
      <p>The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi had on November 1 directed schools to remain closed till November 5 and had banned construction activities after the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority declared a public health emergency as air quality plummeted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the minimum temperature recorded in Delhi was 17.5 degree Celsius, three notches above the season's average.</p>
      <p>According to the IMD, the humidity level recorded was 74 percent. An official said that skies will be partly cloudy later in the day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/delhi-ncr-got-some-relief-from-haze-on-nov-5-further-improvement-in-air-quality-index-expected-4603531.html">Pollution levels dipped in New Delhi</a>, on November 4, from "severe" to "very poor" category. The relief came at a time when the number of vehicles on Delhi’s roads came down significantly with the implementation of the odd-even traffic rationing scheme.</p>
      <p>IMD has said that <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/cyclone-maha-may-weaken-before-nov-7-landfall-on-gujarat-coast-4602521.html">Cyclone Maha</a> and a western disturbance will cause rainfall in parts of the northern plains, covering Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR, on November 6-7 which will improve the situation further.</p>
