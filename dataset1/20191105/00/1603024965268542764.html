      <p>Gautam Duggad, head of Research-Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said that the house is positive on financials, consumer and IT space while it prefers <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/auto-cars-jeeps/marutisuzukiindia/MS24">Maruti</a> in the auto sector. However, he said the house is notÂ positive on capital goods.</p>
      <p>"The sectors where we have a positive viewpoint are financials, consumer and IT. In capital goods...everyone has a positive view on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/infrastructure-general/larsentoubro/LT">L&amp;T</a> because that becomes a default play on the capex cycle. However, where is the capex cycle right now from domestic investment viewpoint? I have no visibility," said Duggad in an interview with <i>CNBC-TV18</i>.</p>
      <p>On the market front overall, Duggad said: "So far we have seen Nifty EPS stable for FY20 and also earnings upgrade and downgrades almost stable now at 1:1. Last quarter it was 3:1. Obviously, the tax cuts have helped."</p>

      <p>He further said that we might end the year with 10-12 percent EPS growth for Nifty.</p>
      <p>In cement sector, he prefers <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/cement-major/ultratechcement/UTC01">UltraTech</a> in largecaps and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/cement-major/jkcement/JKC03">JK Cement</a> among midcaps.</p>
