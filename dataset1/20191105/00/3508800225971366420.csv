晚上不適合去公園運動，因為「植物會釋放二氧化碳」？
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by 林慶順教授


我們想讓你知道的是樹林或公園所釋放的二氧化碳，真的是有害健康，甚至會致命嗎？這些所謂的專家、達人、老師，到底知不知道，二氧化碳要到什麼樣的濃度才會對健康產生影響？更遑論致命？



讀者Xin Yi King在2019年7月17日在臉書留言。可是由於他並沒有加入我的臉書朋友，所以我是在一個多月後搜尋別人的簡訊時，才看到他的留言。
他的留言是：
請教～看了你部落格晚上運動文章，聽某老師說晚上不適合去公園或樹林裡運動，因為植物會釋放二氧化碳對身體不好，不知道這是不是真的？或者是相反？
這位讀者所說的「晚上運動文章」是我在2017年7月19日發表的〈晚上運動有害健康？〉。我在這篇文章裡駁斥晚上運動有害健康的說法。所以，現在這位讀者才會來問，晚上是否適合去公園或樹林裡運動。
的確是有人說，在晚上或清晨樹木會釋放二氧化碳，所以在這些時段到公園或樹林是有害健康的。例如，2017年4月15日《風傳媒》就有發表一篇〈為何早起健走運動，在專家眼裡是找死行為？〉，而它所說的「專家」就是號稱「走路養生達人」的林某（寫了一本叫做《走是養生之王》的書）。（附註：這篇文章有註明是轉載自《華人健康網》）
可是，樹林或公園所釋放的二氧化碳，真的是有害健康，甚至會致命嗎？
這些所謂的專家、達人、老師，到底知不知道，二氧化碳要到什麼樣的濃度才會對健康產生影響？更遑論致命？
根據美國農業部發表的〈Carbon Dioxide Health Hazard Information Sheet〉（二氧化碳健康危害信息表），室外空氣中的二氧化碳含量通常為300－400 ppm（0.03％至0.04％），但在大都會地區則可高達600－900 ppm。
同樣根據這份信息，美國職業安全與健康管理局（Occupational Safety and Health Administration）所允許的工作環境二氧化碳濃度為5000 ppm，而縱然是在10000 ppm的環境裡，頂多也就是有少許人會覺得想睡，但對健康卻是毫無影響。至於可能致命的濃度則是要大於80000 ppm（即大於平常空氣中二氧化碳濃度的200倍）。
又根據一篇2017年4月4日發表的論文〈Carbon dioxide poisoning: a literature review of an often forgotten cause of intoxication in the emergency department〉（二氧化碳中毒：對急診科經常被遺忘的中毒原因的文獻綜述），二氧化碳濃度要超過50000 ppm，它才會引發高碳酸血症和呼吸性酸中毒。
那，您要不要猜猜看，晚上樹林裡的二氧化碳濃度會有多高？
根據一篇1988年發表的論文〈Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the Amazon Basin〉（亞馬遜盆地大氣中的二氧化碳），亞馬遜森林晚上的最高二氧化碳濃度是380到400 ppm。
那，您去散步或做運動的樹林或公園，有可能會有致命的二氧化碳濃度（80000 ppm）嗎？或者，有可能會有對大多數人毫無影響的二氧化碳濃度（10000 ppm）嗎？
或者，您有沒有想過，觀眾多達好幾萬人的球場，尤其是室內的籃球場，二氧化碳濃度會有多高？要知道，我們每個人可都是無時無刻在釋放大量的二氧化碳，那為什麼我們還要冒生命危險去看球賽？為什麼運動員還要捨命比賽？
儘管《風傳媒》那篇文章有說「原因很科學」，但我卻沒看到它有提供任何科學證據。我唯一看到的是所謂的專家的意見，而這些意見很顯然只是這些「專家」推理出來的，而不是經過科學實證。
事實上，我在〈晚上運動有害健康？〉已經有說，沒有任何科學證據顯示一天中的哪個時段是最適合做運動。我也有說，做運動最好的時間是「能讓你持之以恆的時間」。也就是說，能持之以恆才是你應該追求的，而不是一天中的什麼時段。
至於運動的地點，我在〈空污，還運動嗎〉有強調，一定要避開空污嚴重的地方，而公園則是理想的地點。
總之，沒有什麼時段是不適合做運動的，而不管是公園或是樹林，都是非常適合做運動的地點。

It is not suitable for park sports at night because ""plants will release carbon dioxide""?
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by Professor Lin Qingshun


We want you to know that the carbon dioxide released by trees or parks is really harmful to health and even fatal? These so-called experts, experts, teachers, do not know, what kind of concentration of carbon dioxide will affect health? Not to mention fatal?



Reader Xin Yi King wrote a message on Facebook on July 17, 2019. However, since he did not join my Facebook friend, I only saw his message when I searched for someone else's newsletter more than a month later.
His message is:
Ask ~ read your blog night sports article, listen to a teacher said that at night is not suitable for sports in the park or the woods, because plants will release carbon dioxide is not good for the body, do not know if this is true? Or is it the opposite?
The reader’s ""night sports article"" was published on July 19, 2017. ""Night sports are harmful to health? 〉. In this article, I refute the argument that night sports are harmful to health. Therefore, the reader will now ask if it is suitable for going to the park or the woods at night.
It is true that some people say that trees emit carbon dioxide at night or in the early morning, so it is harmful to the park or the woods during these hours. For example, on April 15, 2017, ""Wind Media"" published an article ""Why did you get up early and walked away, and in the eyes of experts, is it a dead act?"" 〉, and what it calls “experts” is Lin, who is known as “walking and health care” (written a book called “Walking is the King of Health”). (Note: This article is noted to be reproduced from the ""Chinese Health Network"")
However, is the carbon dioxide released by trees or parks really harmful to health and even fatal?
These so-called experts, experts, teachers, do not know, what kind of concentration of carbon dioxide will affect health? Not to mention fatal?
According to the Carbon Dioxide Health Hazard Information Sheet published by the US Department of Agriculture, carbon dioxide in outdoor air is typically 300-400 ppm (0.03% to 0.04%), but can be as high as in metropolitan areas. 600-900 ppm.
Also based on this information, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration allows a working environment with a carbon dioxide concentration of 5000 ppm, and even in a 10,000 ppm environment, at most, a few people will feel I want to sleep, but it has no effect on health. As for the potentially fatal concentration, it is greater than 80,000 ppm (that is, 200 times more than the carbon dioxide concentration in normal air).
According to a paper published on April 4, 2017 (Carbon dioxide poisoning: a literature review of an often forgotten cause of intoxication in the emergency department) (carbon dioxide poisoning: a literature review of the causes of poisoning that are often forgotten in the emergency department) If the concentration of carbon dioxide exceeds 50,000 ppm, it will cause hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis.
Then, do you want to guess, how high is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the woods at night?
According to a paper published in 1988 (Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the Amazon Basin), the highest carbon dioxide concentration in the Amazon forest at night is 380 to 400 ppm.
Then, can you have a deadly carbon dioxide concentration (80000 ppm) in a forest or park where you go for a walk or exercise? Or is there a potential for carbon dioxide (10,000 ppm) that has no effect on most people?
Or, have you ever thought that the audience will have tens of thousands of stadiums, especially indoor basketball courts, how high is the carbon dioxide concentration? You know, each of us can release a lot of carbon dioxide all the time, so why do we risk our lives to watch the game? Why do athletes have to give up their lives?
Although the article ""Wind Media"" said ""the reason is very scientific"", I did not see any scientific evidence provided. The only thing I saw was the so-called expert opinion, which was obviously only reasoned by these ""experts"" rather than scientific evidence.
In fact, I am at night, sports are harmful to health? 〉 It has been said that there is no scientific evidence showing which time of day is the best for exercise. I also said that the best time to do sports is ""the time that will allow you to persevere."" In other words, being able to persevere is what you should pursue, not what time of day.
As for the location of the sport, I have emphasized in ""air pollution, still exercise"" that we must avoid places with serious air pollution, and the park is an ideal place.
In short, there is no time when it is not suitable for sports, whether it is a park or a forest, it is a very suitable place for sports.
