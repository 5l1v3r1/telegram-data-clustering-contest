      <p>Public sector lender <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/punjabnationalbank/PNB05">Punjab National Bank</a> on November 5 reported a profit at Rs 507.1 crore in Q2FY20, though asset quality weakened sequentially.</p>
      <p>Other income, PPoP and lower provisions compared to the year-ago period helped the lender report a profit during the quarter.</p>
      <p>The numbers were better than expected. An analysts' poll conducted by CNBC-TV18 had expected the bank to report a loss of Rs 1,521.5 crore. The bank had reported a loss of Rs 4,532.35 crore in the year-ago period due to a spike in provisions.</p>
