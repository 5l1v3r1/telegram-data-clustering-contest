      <p>For a long time, meal prep was a binary choice: Slow and healthy in the oven, or quick and dirty in the microwave. Then people started to realize their pressure cookers actually had a lot to offer.</p>
      <p>Now, it looks like air fryers might be getting their due. Or at least, they will be if they all start offering the functionality of a <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/chefman-6l-digital-multi-function-air-fryer-black?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=chefman-6l-digital-multi-function-air-fryer-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-346632&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrjz&amp;scsonar=1">Chefman 6L Digital Multi-Functional Air Fryer</a>.</p>
      <p>If you've never used an air fryer, let us clear one thing up right away: This unit does a lot more than fry food. Feel like pizza? Make enough for everybody on the dual airflow racks. Chicken dinner? Do it the right way with a rotisserie function that incorporates the real-deal turning spit for an evenly roasting bird. It can bake cookies or pies, and its dehydrating function can turn fruits and veggies into a fun, long-lasting snack.</p>
      <p>And yes, by the way, it also fries, using its well-designed convection to crisp up food with a minimum amount of oil.</p>
      <p>What's more, it can do all this without preheating. And with a generous six-liter capacity, it might just replace both that oven and microwave as the cooker of choice.</p>
      <p>Right now, you can pick up the Chefman for <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/chefman-6l-digital-multi-function-air-fryer-black?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=chefman-6l-digital-multi-function-air-fryer-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-346632&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrjz&amp;scsonar=1">15% off the list price</a>.</p>
