      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bruce-springsteen/">Bruce Springsteen</a> will be presenting a lifetime achievement award next spring to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Richard Ford</a>, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “Independence Day” centers on a real estate agent from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bruce-springsteen/">Springsteen</a>’s native New Jersey.</p>
      <p>But not everyone is happy about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a>’s receiving the Hadada Award, bestowed by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paris-review/">Paris Review</a> at the magazine’s annual spring Revel.</p>
      <p>Pulitzer Prize winner Viet Thanh Nguyen was among those on Twitter who noted that the Hadada has only been given to white writers. Others, including author Roxane Gay, cited <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a>’s history of hostile behavior toward writers who criticized his work. In 2004, he spat on Colson Whitehead after Whitehead wrote a negative review of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a>’s “A Multitude of Sins.” In a 2017 column that ran in Esquire, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> expressed little regret.</p>
      <p>“I can tell you that, as of today, I don’t feel any different about Mr. Whitehead, or his review, or my response,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/paris-review/">Paris Review</a> didn’t have an immediate comment Tuesday and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Whitehead declined comment.</p>

      <p>The 75-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> is known to many for his works about the New Jersey sports writer-turned real estate agent Frank Bascombe: “The Sportswriter,” ”Independence Day,” ”The Lay of the Land” and “Let Me Be Frank With You,” a Pulitzer finalist in 2015.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> has also written book reviews, including one for The New York Times about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bruce-springsteen/">Springsteen</a>’s memoir, “Born to Run,” which came out in 2016. (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bruce-springsteen/">Springsteen</a> has cited <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> as a favorite writer).</p>
      <p>“It helps that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bruce-springsteen/">Springsteen</a> can write - not just life-imprinting song lyrics but good, solid prose that travels all the way to the right margin,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/richard-ford/">Ford</a> wrote. “Oh, there are a few gassy bits here and there, a jot too much couch-inspired hooey about the ‘terrain inside my own head.’ A tad more rock ‘n’ roll highfalutin than this reader really needs - though the Bruce enthusiasts down in Sea-Clift won’t agree with me. No way.</p>

        <p>“But nothing in ‘Born to Run’ rings to me as unmeant or punch-pulling.”</p>
