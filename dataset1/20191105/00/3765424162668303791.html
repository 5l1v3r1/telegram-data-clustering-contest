      <p>Anthony Mackie has quietly got divorced from childhood sweetheart Sheletter Chapital.</p>
      <p>The “Captain America” actor split from his childhood sweetheart Sheletter Chapital late in 2017 after three years of marriage and their union was officially dissolved last year.</p>
      <p>Sources told TMZ things have stayed amicable between the former couple and they have agreed to share joint custody of their four children.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what was agreed in terms of spousal or child support.</p>
      <p>The ‘Avengers: Endgame’ actor is currently focused on his career and is busy shooting his new series ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chris Evans recently admitted he accidentally spoiled the ending of ‘Avengers: Endgame’ for Anthony.</p>
      <p>He said: “While we were filming in Atlanta, I had a few people over to watch football or something, and Mackie was the first one to show up.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know he didn’t know what was going to happen. I say, ‘Hey, man, isn’t that scene fantastic?’ and he said, ‘What scene?’ And I said, ‘The scene where I give you the shield!’ And he said, ‘You’re giving me the shield?’</p>
      <p>“And I said ‘Oh no,’ so I ran to my room and I got the scene and gave it to him, and I got to watch him read the scene for the first time where he’s getting the shield,. And he was so happy and you immediately feel like, ‘Man, maybe I robbed this moment, maybe [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige deserved this.’ But it was so nice to share it with him. He was so happy and so deserving. It was a nice way to have — just between us — the transition of characters.”</p>
      <p>Anthony, 41, has also previously admitted to having his sights set on playing James Bond one day and would like to portray a “mellow” version of the suave spy.</p>
      <p>He has said: “I’ve thought about this a lot. My Bond would be cool, I mean smooth, milky smooth.</p>
      <p>“No nonsense, no pretence. My James Bond would be a very, very mellow man with the ladies. He would be very aggressive in his fighting style.</p>
      <p>“And his Aston Martin would be a convertible with 20 inch rims and an 808 sound system in the trunk so you can hear him coming. That’s my Bond.”</p>
