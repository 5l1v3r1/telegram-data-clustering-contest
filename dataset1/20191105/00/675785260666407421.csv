Starbucks red cups are here - as well as a new toasted marshmallow hot chocolate
The famous red cups are officially back at Starbucks, as the coffee chain announces impressive new festive food and drink menu

Nothing says Christmas quite like the sight of Starbucks' iconic red cups. So turn up the Michael Bublé album and get your cringey Christmas jumpers out, as the coffee shop's statement cups are finally here.
Launching today (Tuesday 5 November) alongside their new winter food and drinks menu, this year Starbucks will also be launching its signature cups in reusable form, as well as the standard paper.
Costing £1.50 for the reusable version - but able to be used again and again - you'll also get a 25p discount every time you bring it.
As for the paper ones, there's a 5p charge, in order to try encourage Starbucks fans to bring their reusable one back instead.


The original festive drinks are back

The new cups are joined by Starbucks' festive food and drink menu, which includes a ‘Tis the Season Turkey Sandwich, Festive Feast Panini and plethora of seasonal sweet treats, such as mince pies, Christmas tree brownies, Twinkle and Sprinkle caramel cupcakes and Christmas bauble chocolate loaf cake.
Drinks-wise, Starbucks will be debuting a brand new winter warmer this year: their Toasted Marshmallow hot chocolate, which combines your usual hot chocolate with delicious marshmallow syrup, topped with marshmallow flavoured whipped cream. It sounds like exactly the type of thing we expect to come out of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory...


There's also lots of new festive sweet treats to be had

A trio of legendary fan favourites are also back by popular demand, including the good old Gingerbread Latte, classic Toffee Nut Latte and traditional Eggnog Latte, which are all also available in ice versions.
There might be a lot on the wish list, but you do have plenty of time to get your hands on the range, which will be available - alongside the red cups - all the way up until the 2nd January.
Full Starbucks festive drinks menu:

Toasted Marshmallow Hot Chocolate, prices from £3.10 – Mocha sauce combined with marshmallow syrup, topped with marshmallow flavoured whipped cream and finished with a caramelised sugar topping. This beverage is a timeless classic with an exciting twist.
Eggnog Latte, prices from £3.15 - Starbucks wildly popular interpretation of holiday eggnog features rich espresso with subtle holiday spices, making it a perfect choice for a crisp autumn or winter day.
Toffee Nut Latte, prices from £3.15 – Toffee nut syrup is combined with the brand's signature Starbucks espresso, steamed milk and topped with whipped cream and a delicious toffee nut flavoured topping.
Gingerbread Latte, prices from £3.15 – Gingerbread syrup is combined with Starbucks' signature Starbucks espresso, steamed milk, topped with gingerbread flavoured whipped cream and a delicious wafer topping.
