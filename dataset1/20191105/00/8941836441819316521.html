      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party-of-new-mexico/">Republican Party of New Mexico</a> appears set to join Nebraska Republicans and endorse President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> for re-election.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/state-gop/">State GOP</a> chairman Steve Pearce told The Associated Press on Monday that an endorsement “would be a mere formality” since everyone on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party-of-new-mexico/">party</a>’s central committee is supporting the president.</p>
      <p>Pearce says he knew of nobody in New Mexico <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/state-gop/">GOP</a> circles who wasn’t supporting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>. He also didn’t know if any of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s Republican challengers, like former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh or former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, would even get on the New Mexico ballot.</p>
      <p>The Nebraska <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/state-gop/">GOP</a> announced in August the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party-of-new-mexico/">party</a> had unanimously endorsed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> for re-election.</p>
