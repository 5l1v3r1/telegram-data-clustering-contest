      <p>PARIS (AP) - Paris Saint-Germain coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-tuchel/">Thomas Tuchel</a> says he’s not interested in the vacant Bayern Munich job and that he’s committed to seeing out his contract with the French champion.</p>
      <p>Bayern fired coach Niko Kovac on Sunday, one day after the seven-time defending German champion lost 5-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt for its heaviest Bundesliga defeat in more than 10 years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-tuchel/">Tuchel</a>, a German, was touted among possible candidates and has reportedly been contacted by Bayern.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a news conference Tuesday ahead of the Champions League group game against Club Brugge, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-tuchel/">Tuchel</a> said: “It doesn’t interest me because I’m PSG coach,” adding that “I have a contract and I can’t think for one minute about other clubs.”</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/thomas-tuchel/">Tuchel</a> signed a new PSG contract last season until June 2021.</p>
