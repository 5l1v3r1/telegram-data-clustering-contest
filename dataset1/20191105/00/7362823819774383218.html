      <p>Is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/anna-faris-admits-to-boy-crazy-past">Anna Faris</a> preparing to get married?</p>
      <p>The "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Mom</a>" star -- who is dating cinematographer Michael Barrett -- was seen on Sunday with a large diamond ring on her left hand, in photos obtained by <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2019/11/04/anna-faris-appears-engaged-shows-off-huge-ring/">TMZ</a>.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://people.com/movies/anna-faris-dating-michael-barrett-after-chris-pratt-split/">People magazine</a>, the couple met while filming "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/anna-faris-cant-rescue-lazy-overboard-remake">Overboard</a>," and are currently preparing to film "Summer Madness," in which the 42-year-old actress will play twins. They began dating in 2017.</p>
      <p>Faris was previously married to actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/chris-pratt">Chris Pratt</a> -- with whom she has a 7-year-old son -- from 2009 to 2017. The pair's divorce was finalized in October 2018.  Before that, Faris was married to actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/scary-movie-actress-anna-faris-divorcing">Ben Indra</a> from 2004-2008.</p>

      <p>Back in April, Faris spoke on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9l9QtGjlOk">"Divorce Sucks!" podcast</a>, explaining that she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/anna-faris-reluctant-to-ever-get-married-again-after-chris-pratt-divorce">struggled with the idea of marriage</a>, having gone through two divorces.</p>

      <p>“I will say I believe in love and monogamy and I believe in the commitment with a relationship," Faris said at the time. "But I do struggle, having gone through it a couple of times now, Laura, with the idea of our legal system. I struggle with that on kind of a feminist level.”</p>
