Wayfair (NYSE: W), a U.S. based e-commerce company that specializes in furniture and home goods, saw its stock price decline by close to 30% over the last week, following its weaker than expected Q3 earnings and lackluster forecast for the holiday quarter. While the company’s revenues were stronger than expected, its costs have been mounting, leading to a wider than expected loss (reported loss per share of -$2.23, versus consensus estimate of -$2.10). Although this is partly due to the tariffs following the U.S-China trade war, which raised prices for the company’s merchandise, customer acquisition costs also appear to be on the rise. This is likely to be concerning for investors, as per-customer spending has remained sluggish (orders per customer were flat YoY), meaning that the company may have to rely on increasingly expensive new customer additions to drive growth. Below, we take a look at how Wayfair has fared in recent years and what to expect from the company over the next year.View our interactive dashboard analysis on How Higher Costs And Slowing Customer Spends Are Hurting Wayfair
