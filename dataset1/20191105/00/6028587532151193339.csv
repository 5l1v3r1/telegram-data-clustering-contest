The global K-pop scene is more competitive than ever these days, but (G)I-DLE have their claws out in their empowering new single just as the girl group’s focus turns more international.Knocking new single “Lion” opens on a bold note with (G)I-DLE vocalist Minnie declaring, “I’m a lion, I’m a queen...nothing can confine me.” The savage theme continues as the ladies show how nothing will stop or define them—a theme that’s been constant in their music and interviews, but never declared so outwardly in a song—over the group’s signature style of undeniable electro-pop production and soaring melodies.
The song’s true message comes to life during the rap bridge by the group’s leader Soyeon, who wrote and produced on the track, where the 21-year-old delivers career-affirming lyrics like, “We tear down your suffocating prejudice,” before adding “I create a new path that no has attempted before...the applause I receive after breaking that prejudice is thrilling,” ending her section with “I've had a taste, now I can't deny it, I'm a queen.”
The accompanying music video keep with the song’s lyrics as the sextet is seen both thriving in regal settings (where members Miyeon, Yuqi and Shuhua sit like true queens in bejeweled thrones and alongside museum-worthy art) and surviving through animalistic settings (Soojin picks at a bloodied scratch on her back, Minnie is surrounded by dangerous arrows while Soyeon looking confined but liberated in a cage). In the final shots of the video, (G)I-DLE seem to declare that whether they’re alongside their dancers or surrounded by an actual pack of lions, they’re staying confident and in control as they confidently stare into the camera.
The timing of a release like “Lion” aligns perfectly just as (G)I-DLE is beefing up their international presence, recently announcing plans to focus more on the U.S. market via a partnership with e2PR Strategic Communications. The group already has made a splash with several singles and EPs in America, most notably hitting the Top 30 of Billboard’s Digital Songs Sales chart as well as the Top 10 of the Pop Digital Song Sales chart putting them in a rare group of K-pop crossover successes that include only BTS and BLACKPINK to date.
