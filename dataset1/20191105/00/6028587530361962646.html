      <p>It’s been a terrific year for one specific group of funds—and that means, if you’re one of many people who own them, you need to be <i>very</i> careful.I’m talking about senior-loan (also known as floating-rate) funds, which have made big gains in 2019. That’s lulled many folks into a false sense of security, idly thinking these steady returns will roll in for the long term.</p>
      <p>That’s a big mistake.</p>
      <p>To see what I mean, look at the <b>Invesco Senior Loan ETF (BKLN)</b>, which serves as something of an index for senior loans. It yields 5.2% and is up 7.3% in 2019. That gain may not sound like much compared to, say, the S&amp;P 500’s 20% rise, but it’s actually huge for senior loans.</p>
      <p>What’s more, this gain is largely a correction to 2018’s oversold market, where fear caused investors to sell everything. Now, we’ve seen BKLN and similar funds make up those losses and return to a sky-high valuation.</p>
      <p>Again, that 6.3% return over almost two years sounds humble, but it’s far ahead of the trend; in the last five years, BKLN has risen 2.7% on average annually, making its two-year return far higher than the norm, even with the big dip in late 2018.</p>
      <p>But the big post-panic recovery isn’t the only reason why now is a good time to move your money out of senior loans. Let’s move on to two even bigger reasons.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Fed Story</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before we go further, a quick primer on senior loans: they’re securitized loans usually given out to mid-sized companies that, for whatever reason, don’t want to issue bonds. Unlike bonds, which have a fixed interest rate, the rate on senior loans varies according to a benchmark rate. That’s another way of saying that when the Fed raises rates, interest payments on these loans rise, too.</p>
      <p>In short, senior loans earn more profit for lenders when interest rates rise. That’s the problem: rates are now <i>falling,</i> which means <i>lower </i>income for BKLN and its shareholders.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Interest Rates Falling</b>

      <p>Right now, the market expects the Fed to cut its interest-rate target in the next year, with a 75% probability of rates being cut at least once.</p>
      <p>If BKLN is going up more now than it was when rates were rising, when the fund would naturally earn more income for its shareholders, that means BKLN’s recent run-up is unsustainable for as long as the Fed plans to cut rates.</p>
      <p>That’s another reason to worry about senior-loan funds, but it’s not the biggest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Smart Money Flees</b>
      </p>
      <p>In anticipation of a fall in senior loans, most investors familiar with this asset class are running away. In the last year, they’ve taken out $42 billion in assets, according to data from EPFR Global. BKLN has seen $2.4 billion of outflows in that time—half its current assets under management.</p>
      <p>Major outflows on top of abnormal market returns add up to a bubble of misinformed or distracted investors mistakenly keeping their money where it shouldn’t be—another reason to run from senior-loan funds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CEF Investors: It’s Past Time to Dump This Loser</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, if we look at <a href="https://contrarianoutlook.com/why-you-need-to-invest-in-closed-end-funds/">closed-end funds (CEFs)</a> that hold senior loans, we see that most are seeing lower-than-average outflows as a portion of total assets. And the worst of the senior-loan bunch is far overpriced.</p>
      <p>That would be the <b>First Trust Senior Floating Rate 2022 Target Fund (FIV),</b> a floating-rate fund whose year-to-date market price (in orange below) exceeds its NAV return (or the gain posted by its portfolio of loans), meaning its discount has been shrinking.</p>
      <p>As a result, FIV’s 5.5% discount is much smaller than it was in 2018—it’s also smaller than the average 4.4% discount among all CEFs. What’s more, FIV has cut its dividend <i>four times </i>in 2019, a year when many CEFs have raised payouts!</p>
      <p>Investors who bought FIV for the “big” dividend have seen the fund’s yield shrink to 3.7%. That’s half the yield on the average CEF and far lower than the yields on many CEFs that are <i>growing </i>their payouts.</p>
      <p>With many headwinds in senior-loan funds and a declining income stream, no one should be holding FIV right now. Yet the fund has seen $32.7 million of net <i>inflows </i>of assets in the last year—which shows you how irrational some CEF investors can be!</p>
