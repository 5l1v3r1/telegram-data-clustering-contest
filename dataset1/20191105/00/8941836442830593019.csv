New program seeks to lure nurses in New Mexico rural areas

05 Nov 2019

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Presbyterian Healthcare Services and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas.
The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns.
The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas.
Officials say the program also will focus on mental health.
Presbyterian Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio.



The first group of nurses and midwives will be selected in the first half of 2020.
