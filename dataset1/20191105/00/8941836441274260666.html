      <p>ORO VALLEY, Ariz. (AP) - Authorities say a Pima County Sheriff’s deputy accused of shoplifting and fraud charges in Oro Valley last month has resigned.</p>
      <p>Sheriff’s officials say 35-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-fuller/">Ryan Fuller</a> quit the department Monday while still on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-fuller/">Fuller</a> was arrested on Oct. 21 after turning himself in to Oro Valley police after allegedly shoplifting at a Walmart in that town.</p>

      <p>Oro Valley police told the Arizona Daily Star that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ryan-fuller/">Fuller</a> allegedly was switching barcodes on some store items.</p>
