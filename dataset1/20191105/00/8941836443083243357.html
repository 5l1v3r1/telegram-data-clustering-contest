      <p>OXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Police in Maryland say a man fatally stabbed another customer outside a Popeye’s restaurant in a fight over the recently rereleased chicken sandwich.</p>
      <p>Prince George’s County police spokeswoman Jennifer Donelan told news outlets the two men were waiting in line at an Oxon Hill Popeye’s Monday night when one of the men accused the other of cutting in front of him in a line specifically for ordering chicken sandwiches. Police say the fight spilled outside where one of the men stabbed the other.</p>
      <p>Police say the 28-year-old victim was from the Washington area. He was taken to a hospital, where he died less than an hour later.</p>
      <p>Donelan said police are looking for the suspect and have called on him to surrender.</p>
