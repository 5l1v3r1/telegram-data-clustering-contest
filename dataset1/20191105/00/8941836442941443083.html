      <h1>Cam Newton out for season with lingering foot injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>The Carolina Panthers placed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cam-newton/">Cam Newton</a> on injured reserve with a foot injury that’s sidelined him since Week 2, ending the quarterback’s season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cam-newton/">Newton</a> suffered the injury during a preseason game, but came back to play in the Panthers’ first two games of the regular season before being held out. The injury was first thought to be a sprain, but later was diagnosed as a Lisfranc fracture.</p>
      <p>Reports <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1190406258018439168">said</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cam-newton/">Newton</a>’s injury was not improving enough over the past several weeks, in which he has been rehabbing and unable to practice.</p>
      <p>With the Panthers’ decision, Kyle Allen will start at quarterback for the rest of the season, including when the Washington Redskins visit Carolina in Week 13.</p>
      <p>Carolina general manager Marty Hurney said in a statement that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cam-newton/">Newton</a> still needed “significant time” to fully heal.</p>
