Man charged in fatal shooting pleads not guilty

05 Nov 2019

CLEVELAND (AP) - Authorities say a man suspected in a shooting that left three people dead in Cleveland has pleaded not guilty to an aggravated murder charge
Twenty-five-year-old Kielonte Harris pleaded not guilty Monday in Municipal Court to the sole count of aggravated murder. His bond was set at $1.5 million. Court records don’t show an attorney for Harris.
Authorities say they found 36-year-old April Magana’s body inside a home and 31-year-old Joseph Meeks III dead in an alley outside the home Saturday. An injured Muriel Tursivio was found in a vacant lot nearby and died at a hospital.
Police say all three were attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.

A prosecutor said at Monday’s hearing that he expects additional charges to be filed against Harris.
