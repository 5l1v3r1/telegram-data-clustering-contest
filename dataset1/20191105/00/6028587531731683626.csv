Statement necklaces worthy of red carpet status stole the spotlight at both the New York Jewelry & Watch Show (Oct 25-28, 2019) and Tefaf Art Fair New York (Nov 1-5, 2019). Designs ranged from the 1800s through mid-century, styles which could easily be seen on A-list celebrities as we head into awards season. For collectors of antique and vintage jewelry in search of rare, singular, stand out pieces, there were a range of museum quality necklaces. Signed pieces from renowned jewelers such as Belperron and authentic pendants dating back to the Renaissance period were among the highlights of the shows as were the awe-inspiring pieces that could be converted into diadems, brooches and earrings, removable pendants  and could split into two bracelets.Here are some of the authentic and awe inspiring styles from both of the shows:
