      <p>The government may discontinue spending on 200-odd schemes in order to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.</p>
      <p>The report noted that these schemes would be having a non-prirotity status, and that government was carrying out a token spend on these schemes. The report also noted that the impact of discontinuing these schemes would likely be reflected in the budget for FY21.</p>
      <p>State governments are likely to have been notified of the step as they ultimately implement the schemes that receive the funding from the Centre, the report noted.</p>
