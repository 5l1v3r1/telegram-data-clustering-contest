Chelsea salvages 4-4 draw after Ajax surrenders 3-goal lead

05 Nov 2019

LONDON (AP) - Substitute Reece James completed an improbable comeback for Chelsea against Ajax in the Champions League on Tuesday as the host came from three goals down to draw 4-4 after the Dutch team was reduced to nine men.
Ajax was 4-1 up at Stamford Bridge after 55 minutes, but Chelsea pulled a goal back in the 63rd before Daley Blind and Joel Veltman were both sent off in a sequence that completely changed the game.
Chelsea was also awarded a penalty for handball by Veltman - which led to his second booking - and Jorginho made it 4-3 with his second spot kick of the game.
James equalized with a low show from a rebound in the 74th to complete the comeback, and Chelsea even thought it had scored a late winner through Cesar Azpilicueta. However, the goal was ruled out for a handball on Tammy Abraham after a video review.
Abraham’s own goal had given Ajax the lead before Jorginho equalized with his first penalty. Quincy Promes put Ajax in front with a header, while another own goal by Kepa Arrizabalaga and Donny van de Beek’s strike gave Ajax a three-goal lead.
