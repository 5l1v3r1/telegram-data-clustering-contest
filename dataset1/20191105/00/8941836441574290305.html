      <h1>Foles will start for Jaguars over Minshew after bye week</h1>

      <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Jaguars coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Doug Marrone</a> believes quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Nick Foles</a> gives the team “a better chance of winning right now.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> announced Tuesday he will start <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> over rookie sensation <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Gardner Minshew</a> “going forward.” He made the decision during the team’s bye week, saying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> is ready to return from a broken left collarbone and will start next week at Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>“For me, it was looking back at all the work we put in,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said. “I just go back to the experience and what he’s going to be able to do. I think that’s going to give us the ability, a better chance of winning right now.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> told both players before a team meeting. Players were not available to the media afterward. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Minshew</a> took the news like “a competitor.”</p>
      <p>“When I say someone’s a competitor and they hear something like that, I think everyone can figure that out,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> was injured while throwing a 35-yard touchdown pass to DJ Chark on the second series of the team’s season opener. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Minshew</a> replaced him and went 4-4 as the starter, throwing for 2,285 yards, with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also ran for 235 yards but has lost seven of an NFL-leading 11 fumbles.</p>
      <p>“What he’s done, he’s done a great job,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said. “I feel a whole different about him now than I did prior to him playing, in a very positive way. We took some things and had some discussions on things that we’re going to work on going forward, which will give him the ability to be a player in this league for a long time. I really believe that.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Minshew</a> was a sixth-round draft pick from Washington State and became a fan favorite by giving the Jaguars a chance in nearly every game.</p>
      <p>His 1970s look - he rocks a groovy headband, an unkempt mustache, jean shorts and throwback T-shirts - is as much a part of his engaging persona as stories that range from pre-game stretching while wearing only a jock strap to trying to break his hand during college in hopes of earning an extra year of eligibility.</p>

        <p>But most everyone expected the Jaguars to go back to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a>, a former Super Bowl MVP who signed a four-year, $88 million contract to leave Philadelphia in March.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Minshew</a> looked more like a rookie than a savvy vet in three of Jacksonville’s last four games. He was jittery in the pocket and mostly inept in the red zone.</p>
        <p>He led the Jags to a mere field goal in a 26-3 drubbing by Houston in London on Sunday. He threw for 309 yards, most of them in garbage time. The other numbers were more telling: 27 of 47. Two interceptions. Two lost fumbles. A number of off-target throws. Passer rating of 59.6, his second-lowest of the season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said he tried to ignore <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gardner-minshew/">Minshew</a>’s performance across the pond while making his choice.</p>
        <p>“I tried to take that out and put it as a body of work, and that’s what I did,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said. “I think that’s important. I think emotions can run sometimes differently, so I looked at the body of work.”</p>
        <p>Jacksonville waived another former Super Bowl MVP, former Seattle linebacker Malcolm Smith, to make room for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> on the 53-man roster. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a>, who led the Eagles to four playoff victories over the last two seasons, returned to practice two weeks ago and was officially activated from injured reserve Tuesday.</p>
        <p>“We’ve progressively brought him back into drills and brought him into some high-speed, close-quarter rushing, where guys were coming at him, blitzes where people were coming free,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doug-marrone/">Marrone</a> said. “We felt like we did the best job to make sure that he was in position to be ready once he was healthy.”</p>
