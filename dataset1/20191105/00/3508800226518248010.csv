從毛澤東的「人民」到韓國瑜的「庶民」，都是政客製造矛盾的話術工具
05 Nov 2019, 00:13 by 張宇韶


我們想讓你知道的是由台灣當下的政治語言來說，韓國瑜顯然就以毛澤東為師，只是界線的階級標準由「人民」轉換為「庶民」，打倒的對象成為由「黑五類」轉換成「又白又胖」，取而代之的訴求則是「庶民起義團結發大財萬歲」。



在中共統戰術語中，「人民」與「解放」兩個字應該是最被高度符號化的兩個概念。所謂人民，其實指的就是「黨的朋友或同路人」，這是統戰思維下必須要爭取的對象，即便存在某些互動上的問題，也屬於「非對抗性的人民內部矛盾」，透過溝通對話就能妥善處理。換言之，敵人就是「黨與人民的階級敵人」，本質的問題必然屬於「對抗性的敵我矛盾」，只能透過你死我活的殘酷鬥爭劃清界線。
在此背景下，區分朋友與敵人是中共進行統戰的最大前提，如果沒有搞清楚朋友與敵人的關係則是犯了路線上的錯誤，必然受到黨的批判與再教育。簡單地說，一旦把朋友當敵人就是犯了左傾「躁進主義」的錯誤，如果把敵人當朋友則是右傾「投降主義」的錯誤，由於後者涉及「立場問題」其嚴重性遠甚於「認識問題」，所以在路線上何以多數人都選擇「寧左勿右」的政治正確，道理不言而諭。
深入觀察，人民的定義權始終是掌權的中共當權派手中，因此在歷史不同發展階段以及政經需求下，朋友與敵人的性質總有不同的內涵與意義。例如中共建政之初，基於物經濟重建的需要，需要部分資產階級的投入，因此毛澤東以「新民主主義」為名，刻意將「小資產、民族資產階級」與「工、農群眾」置於人民的定義中，敵人則被窄化成「黑五類」（地富反壞右），人民的意義也是中共國旗「共產黨領導下的人民四大階級」的由來。
對象可以改變，但「敵人」必須存在
在之後的政治發展中，基於毛澤東的權力考量，人民與敵人的定義自然會進行調整，昔日小資產與民族資產階級曾經是中共概念下的同路人，但是隨著社會主義改造與反右鬥爭，他們隨即在消失在歷史的舞台上。大躍進與文革時期，毛澤東偏執認為黨內的計畫市場派菁英始終威脅自己的政治地位，以「無產階級大革命」為訴求，冠上「革命無罪、造反有理」的口號，「砲打中央司令部，向中央奪權」的大字報遂成為文化大革命最重要革命造反訊號。在這場權力鬥爭中，階級敵人一夕之間則變成了「黨內死不悔改的走資派」，劉少奇與鄧小平隨即成為人人喊打的人民公敵。

直白說，中共只要與人民劃上等號，就意味所謂的解放與公平正義的實踐，作為對立面的敵人則是與生俱來的階級敵人，給予定義的當權者永遠都以救世主或解放者，人民只是掌權者用來進行政治操作或是權力鬥爭的工具而已。
由台灣當下的政治語言來說，韓國瑜顯然就以毛澤東為師，只是將彼時劃清界線的階級標準由「人民／無產階級」轉換為「庶民／世間苦人」，打倒的對象成為由「資產階級／黑五類」轉換成「民進黨當權派／又白又胖／韓黑」，取而代之的訴求則是「庶民起義團結發大財萬歲」，口號轉換成「國家安全、人民有錢」，其背後邏輯與文革時的毛澤東如出一轍。
「政治奇才」韓國瑜搞分化的方式，與毛澤東如出一轍
韓國瑜透過激化藍營群眾的恐懼與仇恨意識成為階級鬥爭的社會能量，透過「庶民/權貴」的二元對立思維作為區別敵我的符號，經由特定媒體與國民黨政客無限上綱的吹捧造神營造救世主形象，其後隨機進行各項針對權貴進行批鬥的政治攻擊，這些內容多半沒欠缺證據且流於情緒，但對累積群眾動員的效能頗有助益。
在批鬥之同時，韓國瑜也必須端出各種福音式的「解放遠景」，這些挾帶不少謊言與空洞的內容，與其說帶領群眾走向不可知的未來，不如說是復辟到那個深藍熟悉的美好年代：那個政治體制高壓威權、強人集權一黨獨大、社會保守單一、經濟高速起飛的黨國年代。

諷刺的是，毛澤東與韓國瑜本身都有不足為外人道以的心病。
在廬山會議上，彭德懷在其萬言書中一句「小資產階級狂熱」直接點出毛「假無產階級」的正當性問題；同樣的，韓國瑜雖然不斷強調「莫望世間苦人多」或「苦民所苦」的「庶民姿態」，卻難掩自己真權貴的身份與言行。更矛盾的是，除了一般的市井小民外，不少韓粉根本就是坐擁黨國體制既得利益者（如八百壯士），或是宰制庶民經濟的地方派系成員，這些人突然成為意圖打倒權貴階級的庶民身份，看在長期被宰制與剝削的青年、社會勞工與地方農民眼中，實在情何以堪。
至於那些為韓國瑜背書的知識菁英，早已成為黨國「以中國為中心」或「儒家道德」長期教育下的犬儒者，在國民黨集體主義與道德主義的制約下，豈有獨立思考與反思批判能力？這些人與生俱來具有身份優越感，對民進黨的任何主張始終持全盤否定的態度，加上心理上具備標準的「斯德哥爾摩」症候群，過去養尊處優的身份與生活，反成為被邪惡歹徒進行情緒勒索或道德綁架的緣由，最後甘願為其辯護不難理解。

From ""the people"" of Mao Zedong to the ""untouchables"" of South Korea's Yu, all are politicians' contradictory tools.
05 Nov 2019, 00:13 by Zhang Yuzhen


What we want you to know is that in the current political language of Taiwan, Korean Yu is obviously a teacher with Mao Zedong, but the class standard of the boundary is changed from ""people"" to ""people"", and the object of defeat is ""black five."" The conversion to ""white and fat"", replaced by the appeal of ""the people of the people uprising united to make a fortune.""



In the terminology of the CCP's united front, the words ""people"" and ""liberation"" should be the two most highly symbolized concepts. The so-called people actually refer to ""party friends or fellow travelers"". This is the object that must be won under the united front thinking. Even if there are some interaction problems, it is also a ""non-confrontational internal contradiction of the people"". It can be handled properly. In other words, the enemy is the ""class enemy of the party and the people."" The essential problem must belong to the ""confrontational contradiction between the enemy and the enemy."" Only through the cruel struggle of your life and death can we draw a clear line.
In this context, the distinction between friends and enemies is the greatest premise of the CCP's united front. If you do not understand the relationship between friends and enemies, it is a mistake in the line, and it must be criticized and re-educated by the party. To put it simply, once a friend is an enemy, he is guilty of a left-handed ""intrusionism"". If the enemy is a friend, it is a mistake of right-handed ""subjectionism"". Because the latter involves ""positional problems,"" the severity is much more serious than ""the problem."" I know the problem, so why do most people choose the political correctness of ""Ning Zuo Zuo You"" on the route, and the truth is not to be said.
In-depth observation, the people's right to define is always in the hands of the CCP's power in power, so in the different stages of development of history and political and economic needs, the nature of friends and enemies always have different connotations and meanings. For example, at the beginning of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the need for the reconstruction of the material economy required the investment of some bourgeoisie. Therefore, in the name of ""new democracy,"" Mao Zedong deliberately placed ""small assets, national bourgeoisie"" and ""workers and peasants"". In the definition of the people, the enemy is narrowed down into ""black five categories"" (the rich and the bad are right), and the meaning of the people is also the origin of the CCP's flag ""the four major classes of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party.""
Objects can change, but ""enemy"" must exist
In the subsequent political development, based on Mao Zedong’s power considerations, the definition of the people and the enemy will naturally be adjusted. In the past, the small assets and the national bourgeoisie were once the same people under the CCP concept, but with the socialist transformation and the anti-right struggle, they It disappeared on the stage of history. During the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong’s paranoia believed that the party’s planning market sent elites to threaten their political status. The “proletarian revolution” was the slogan of “revolution, no sin, rebellion and rationality”. The command of the headquarters to seize power from the central government became the most important revolutionary rebellion signal of the Cultural Revolution. In this power struggle, the class enemies became ""the unrepentant capitalists in the party"" overnight, and Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping immediately became the public enemies of everyone.

To put it bluntly, as long as the CCP equates with the people, it means the so-called liberation and the practice of fairness and justice. The enemy as the opposite is the innate class enemy. The person who gives the definition is always the savior or liberator. The people are only tools used by those in power to conduct political operations or power struggles.
In the current political language of Taiwan, South Korea’s Yu is obviously a teacher of Mao Zedong. He only converted the class standard that defined the boundary from the ""people/proletariat"" to ""the people/worldly sufferings"". The ""bourgeoisie/black five"" is converted into ""the DPP is in power/white and fat/han black"". Instead, the appeal is ""the long-awaited reunion and unity of the people,"" and the slogan is translated into ""national security, people have The logic behind it is exactly the same as Mao Zedong at the time of the Cultural Revolution.
The ""political genius"" of Korean yogi's way of differentiation is exactly the same as that of Mao Zedong.
Through the intensification of the fear and hatred consciousness of the blue camp people, South Korea Yu became the social energy of the class struggle. Through the binary opposition of ""the people/power"" as the symbol of the difference between the enemy and the enemy, through the specific media and the KMT politicians infinitely touting the gods The image of the Savior was created, and then various political attacks against the dignitaries were carried out at random. Most of these contents were not lacking in evidence and flowing into emotions, but they were helpful for accumulating the effectiveness of mass mobilization.
At the same time of fighting, South Korea’s Yu must also come up with various gospel-style “liberation vistas”. These shackles bring a lot of lies and empty content, rather than leading the masses to an unknowable future, it is better to restore to the deep blue familiarity. The Belle Époque: The political system with high-pressure authoritarianism, strong party power, one-party singularity, single social conservative, and high-speed economic take-off.

Ironically, both Mao Zedong and South Korea's Yu have their own mental illnesses that are not enough for outsiders.
At the Lushan meeting, Peng Dehuai’s ""small bourgeoisie fanaticism"" in his Wanyan book directly pointed out the legitimacy of the ""fake proletariat""; similarly, the Korean Yu continued to emphasize ""there are many people in the world"" or It is difficult to conceal the identity and words and deeds of the true and powerful people. What is more contradictory is that apart from the general market and small people, many Korean powders are simply vested in the party state system (such as eight hundred strong men), or local faction members who control the economy of the people. These people suddenly become intentions to knock down. The identity of the powerful class is seen in the eyes of young people, social workers and local farmers who have been slaughtered and exploited for a long time.
As for the intellectual elites who are the endorsements of Korean Yushu, they have long become the cynics of the party-state ""China-centered"" or ""Confucian morality"". Under the constraints of Kuomintang collectivism and moralism, they have independent thinking and reflective criticism. ability? These people are born with a sense of identity and superiority. They always hold a total negative attitude towards the DPP. Together with the psychologically standard ""Stockholm"" syndrome, the past identity and life of pampering has become a sinister The reason for emotional blackmail or moral abduction is that it is not difficult to understand why it is willing to defend it.
