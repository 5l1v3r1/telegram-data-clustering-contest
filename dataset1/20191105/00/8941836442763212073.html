      <h1>Hungary says Huawei to help build its 5G wireless network</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">PABLO GORONDI</a></address>
      <p>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Chinese tech company <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> will take part in the construction of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>’s next-generation 5G wireless network despite concerns among key allies like the U.S. about potential snooping by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s International Import Expo in Shanghai, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Tuesday that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> will cooperate with Britain’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vodafone/">Vodafone</a> and Germany’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/deutsche-telekom/">Deutsche Telekom</a> in the project.</p>
      <p>He said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a> does not discriminate between companies based on their country of origin, as long as they respect <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>’s laws and regulations.</p>
      <p>The United States has tried to persuade allies to shun <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>, which it says can be forced to give the Chinese government backdoor access to data.</p>
      <p>The question was a key issue during a February meeting in Budapest between Szijjarto and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>

      <p>“We know about the risks that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>’s presence in their networks present - actual risks to their people, to the loss of privacy protections for their own people, to the risk that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> will use this in a way that is not in the best interest of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>,” Pompeo said at the time.</p>
      <p>In April, Szijjarto said that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>’s good cooperation with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> was in the country’s economic and strategic interests. He has called disapproval of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>’s openness toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> “hypocritical,” as countries and companies all over the world do business with the country.</p>
      <p>Without specifically targeting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>, the European Union recently has also expressed security concerns about the involvement of “states or state-backed actors” like the Chinese company in the development of 5G networks.</p>
      <p>“Hostile third countries may exercise pressure on 5G suppliers in order to facilitate cyberattacks serving their national interests,” the EU said in a security assessment released last month.</p>

        <p>Under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a> has made “mutual respect” a cornerstone of its foreign policy, a pragmatic approach that, in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s case, for example, has mostly avoided sensitive topics like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a>’s treatment of its Uighur minority or the protests in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a> became the first Chinese company to strike a “strategic partnership” with the Hungarian government, a deal meant to ensure and expand the company’s role in the country’s economy, and the Orban government has emphasized the need to attract Chinese investments.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei/">Huawei</a>’s decade-old production and logistics facilities in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>, its Europe Supply Center, provides products to over 40 countries and is the company’s largest such complex outside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a> is also taking part in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s multibillion-dollar “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/beijing/">Beijing</a> is financing the reconstruction of railway lines between Budapest and Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, supposedly to facilitate the transportation of Chinese goods to Europe.</p>
        <p>The project has been criticized as needless and too expensive, but Orban has said it enhances <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hungary/">Hungary</a>’s economic position regardless of its profitability, which he said was of secondary importance.</p>
