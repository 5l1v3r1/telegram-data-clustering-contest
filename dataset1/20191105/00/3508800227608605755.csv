從台灣走向國際的動保人：不只要為動物發聲，也要做一個有反思性的公民
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by 關懷生命協會


我們想讓你知道的是一直在嘗試各種社會參與形式和「戰鬥位置」的龍緣之，仍然在找尋其他可能性。取得博士學位後，她希望自己能成為獨立學者、行動者，「擁有自己的話語權和研究的獨立性，和國際及草根組織合作，推動以華人世界為主，卻與全世界相關的動物解放工作。」



文：蔡育琳
曾經在街頭巷尾抓貓TNR（Trap誘捕、Neuter絕育、Return回置），卻因為要求前男友讓吃剩飯的「被鏈犬」偶而也能散步，引發了兩人尖銳的衝突。曾經在各國進行「零皮草」和動物表演的調查及宣傳，卻無法說服親友棄用皮草和肉食、不去動物園和水族館。從參與學校社團、地方草根團體到國際性NGO組織，十多年來，龍緣之在許多國家嘗試過各式各樣「動物保護」的實踐，卻也經歷過騙財騙色、管理不良，或不再具有理想性的動保團體。
「在某一、兩年間，我真的覺得為了這件事，我願意付出整個人生，甚至我的生命。」在一位動保前輩自殺後，龍緣之接手了對方的工作，曾經日以繼夜的投入、求知若渴的學習，但在那幾年裡，「沒有一個晚上不是血腥的夢魘」。龍緣之認為，越深入從事動物保護工作，就難免對社會有逆反心理，因為社會主流對待動物的態度，正是鑲嵌在奴役動物的制度之中。當人們以此為透鏡時，不僅在食、衣、住、行處處展現了人類對動物的施暴和剝削，還包括兒童和婦女、少數族裔、弱勢群體的處境，都因此原形畢露。
對於普通民眾能否改變，龍緣之不會抱過度的期待，對於動保人則有較高的標準。「當我們日復一日去拍攝、介入、揭露養殖場和屠宰場，以及明目張膽地虐待動物的馬戲團時，我們冒著危險，經歷心靈的煎熬、精神的折磨，意圖喚起社會上可能還僅存的一點良知……」雖然是自願選擇這種使命，但如果自許為是一個行動者，卻沒有勇氣踏入現場或認識真相，更缺乏意願從飲食等行為開始改變的人，龍緣之說：「我認為他們不是嚴肅的動物倡議者」。
龍緣之，1985年出生於台灣，自從華梵大學哲學系畢業後，就到中國投入動保領域和更多學術追求。除了求學，她也周遊列國，與許多動保組織交流合作，是少數從台灣走向國際的動保人之一。「我真的知道，一個人因為參與動保或是做救助，可以精神崩潰或是把家庭和自己的生活拖垮，是什麼樣子。」曾有好幾年的時間，她也是日日以淚洗面，「每天都想放棄」，卻深入那些普通人不願去想，甚至連動保人也不願去面對的地方。如今，她仍相信這個運動的價值，並以此為終生志業。
為何會有這些經歷和轉變？我們在訪談中細說從頭，一起回顧她的成長過程。


在龍緣之的成長過程中，最重要的伙伴之一就是鴨子Bibi。他們家在馬路邊，車水馬龍，然而每當她父親騎著機車回家，Bibi總是遠遠就能聽到聲音，並開始呱呱叫著呼應。每個回到家的人，都必須和Bibi玩耍一番，牠才會心滿意足的回窩裡睡覺。龍緣之自從和Bibi一起生活，就迷上了兒童文學《杜立德醫生》和動物行為學之父勞倫茲的書《所羅門王的指環》、《雁鵝與勞倫茲》。她曾經天真的想為Bibi尋找一位鴨子伴侶，卻讓Bibi和另一隻鴨子「黛黛」（名字取自「林黛玉」）結為終生怨偶。直到20年之後，龍緣之才恍然大悟，原來所有被出售為寵物的小鴨，都是被養殖業者淘汰的公鴨。Photo Credit: 龍緣之提供

成長的困惑與探索
從小喜歡思考和閱讀，國中時愛上了電影，龍緣之從14歲就寫影評投稿，漸漸的不只得到稿費還有免費電影票，一年可以在電影院看幾百部電影。因為她對各種思想的興趣、對不同社會文化的關注，也看了許多寫實的紀錄片，開始關心女性主義、廢死、人權、社運等議題，對於肉食文化則感到困惑和懷疑。
在成長階段養成了觀察、思考和批判能力，龍緣之進入華梵大學哲學系就讀，感覺也是順理成章的一件事。讀大學時，她看了一部電影《詭辯：殺貓的藝術》，這是加拿大導演Zev Asher在2004年的作品，敘述三個學生以藝術為名的殺貓事件。從過去她對肉食的質疑，到這部影片對殺戮的赤裸呈現，點點滴滴的累積，讓她在觀看影片的當下決定成為素食者，至今不曾動搖。
2005年，朱增宏老師（現為台灣動物社會研究會執行長）在華梵大學代課，和學生共同成立「動物與社會讀書會」。當時龍緣之因同學介紹而加入，每周師生聚會一次，探討「五大」動物議題（同伴動物／流浪動物、野生動物、實驗動物、動物園、經濟動物）。直到大學畢業後，仍延續著這樣的交流頻率，讓她更加認識各種動物的處境。
哲學系畢業後，龍緣之考上哲學研究所，但她希望能更深入的參與社會活動，特別是中國大陸的運動現狀。於是她辦理休學前往北京，很快結識了當地的素食者和動保人，大家一起救援動物、到各地進行公益活動。另一方面，她接連在北大和清華念碩士和博士，期間到日本東京工業大學進行一年半的項目研究。對她來說，在高校攻讀學位，除了培養動保論述和研究能力外，也是因為對社運和NGO的批判性思考，讓她可以不只是一個「和尚對和尚念經」、千篇一律的「動保傳聲筒」。
龍緣之形容自己：「全職都在做動保，讀書只是兼職。」儘管如此，她的碩士和博士學位論文主題都與動物相關。2010年進入北京大學藝術學院，三年後完成碩士論文：《「獸片」在上海，1930年代以《申報》爲中心的研究》‍。2013年進入清華大學科學技術與社會研究所，五年後完成博士論文：《對大熊貓保護的STS研究》（STS：science科學、technology技術、society社會）。


2011年，「行動亞洲」首次的「零皮草」宣傳中，龍緣之邀請民眾「寫一句支持零皮草的話，並和自己一起合影」，活動名稱為「零皮草自拍」。她從身邊的親友開始動員，首先就是她在北京收養的流浪貓咪「Kaka」和「Koko」，與貓食排列出的No Fur字樣合照。實際上，皮草不僅來自養殖場的水貂、狐狸和貉，也同樣來自貓、狗等伴侶動物。多年後，這個活動發展為「亞洲零皮草」（Fur Free Asia），邀請人們作出「零皮草手勢」合影來表達支持理念。Photo Credit: 龍緣之提供

投入動保、進入組織
在中國和日本生活超過10年的時間，龍緣之在求學求知以外，更是一個實際的行動者，曾經參與包括NGO團體「行動亞洲」（Act Asia）、「日本動物權利中心」（Animal Right Center Japan，簡稱ARCJ），以及深具學院背景的「中國動物園觀察」（China Zoo Watch），也跟各國學者－行動者（scholar-activist）建立了長期的合作關係。因為調查研究、國際合作及交流等，讓她有機會遊歷歐亞各國，觀察不同社會中的動物處境和動物倡議的現況。
英國被普遍認為是當代動物保護運動的發源地，龍緣之曾到幾個動物收容所（犬、貓、馬、農場動物等等）訪問或實習，因此了解到人們要進當地的動保組織工作，並不是一件容易的事。她說：「這個領域發展了一百多年，動保已經專業化並職業化，對於職業素養、工作人員的專業要求都很高。」相對於發展中國家而言，在這種發達國家的動保組織裡，員工個人的情感或取向不太重要，就看員工可不可用、好不好用，她引述國外動保伙伴對此的形容：「在越大的團體中，員工越是disposable（用完即棄），反正後面有大批熱血青年。」
在北歐諸國，龍緣之開展了她獨立的動保項目，因此對她而言別具意義。她認為當地NGO工作者與其社會和人文環境的良性互動，很值得借鑑：「人們對於公益的觀念認識已深，當我和在地伙伴討論問題時，關注的事物遠遠不僅止於動物『保護』，而是文化、社會、國際主義......同時也是一種不離批判性思考，卻又溫柔包容、屬於理想中的人際間的信任關係。動物倡議是一個正常而且有尊嚴的工作，被整個社會認可，動保人士『對人和動物』一樣尊重。」
用生命參與的志業
除了在中國深刻的社會參與經驗，在日本的動物權運動，才是讓龍緣之選擇繼續投入、並以動物保護研究為終生志業的契機。在東京工業大學當交換生的一年半期間，龍緣之也進入「日本動物權利中心」（Animal Rights Center Japan，簡稱ARCJ）當實習生。實際上，參與日本社會運動的機會，遠比在日本的大學就讀更令她期待。每天上午她到東京的目黑區上課，下午則跟辦公室伙伴一同上街頭推廣和陳抗，或是到各地養殖場、動物園進行調查。
在日本的規律生活和全身心的投入，讓她得以近距離觀察當地的動保運動。其中，日本人的學習和研究能力，給她留下了不容小覷的印象：「無論是研究、演講活動，或是調研報告的出版，總有不少志工或民眾願意付費學習。雖然日本的動物權團體不多，規模小且精減人力，卻能完成驚人的工作量。」龍緣之說明，日本的動物權團體大多以會員制維持組織營運，以ARCJ為例，全日本會員約為300人，在農業縣如秋田、青森的會員僅有一、兩人。
曾有一場分享會讓她留下深刻印象，主講人Kaji是一位資歷超過30年的志工，自從1985年動物權利團體於日本草創以來就投身其中，當天老先生一邊掉淚一邊回顧過往，觀眾們也專注聆聽，真摯的情感打動了人心。在龍緣之看來，這些在辦公室中日以繼夜工作、在街頭無懼風吹日曬和他人譏諷嘲笑的前輩們，除了對理想的熱情令人感佩，還有持續不斷、帶有反省性的學習精神，是在物質富裕、人情冷淡，人口兩億多但動物倡議支持者卻屈指可數的日本社會中，帶給她最大的溫暖和希望。


2012年9月在中國深圳，「行動亞洲」（Act Asia）邀請了各動保團體及大學動保社團，展開為期兩天的「拒絕血腥皮草工作坊暨第七屆中國動物保護訓練營」。「行動亞洲」在中國是第一個針對皮草議題進行倡議的團體，龍緣之（後排左三）當時擔任「行動亞洲」北京代表及零皮草項目專員，在訓練營中講解皮草基本概念、消費者需知、識別真假皮草的方法等等。Photo Credit: 龍緣之提供

對於中國的動保現況，龍緣之認為還在起步階段，雖有不少國際組織進入中國，卻以過分主流的行銷方式進行動保，例如：請明星或企業家拍攝代言、購買媒體版面，龍緣之雖然不免參與其中，卻也抱著一定的批判立場。她想要探究的是：「動物倡議作為社會運動的組成部分，它的主體性在哪裡？」她的個性務實，卻堅持運動應該保留一部份的理想性：「不只要為動物發聲，也要做一個有反思性的公民。」
出身哲學背景，龍緣之卻強調動物保護的調查和研究，絕不可以僅止於文獻回顧和哲思，而是要花費大量時間到田野場域，以多視角、綜合性的方法來理解問題，培養自己對議題的敏銳度，「用生命參與進去」。龍緣之曾在十多個國家進行調研旅行，在她看來，台灣堪稱是亞洲區的「楷模」。
「台灣是我覺得最能在生活中，可以看到、聽到跟動保相關又相對正確訊息的地方。無動物實驗的生活用品、盡可能對動物友善的畜牧產品，以及素食餐廳和食物，選項多而且質量好。許多店家也樂意張貼或放置動保宣傳品。」她認為台灣的開放性較高，或許可以做為一個典範、實驗案例的場域。然而，也正是因為地方小，市場亦有局限性，動物保護進步的歷程、情況及潛在的影響力，有著容易被國際社會忽視的劣勢。
如何前進與拓展
2018年秋天，龍緣之回到母校華梵大學，參與哲學系課程「佛教NPO與人文關懷」的偕同授課。課程從名稱看起來跟動物沒什麼關聯，但由於她對動物議題及倫理學的興趣，這堂課經常在討論各種和動物相關的問題，同學們也相當關心動物的處境和倫理爭議，因此被龍緣之形容為「簡直要成為動保課」。
她認為，動物研究（animal studies）永遠不能僅僅止於談論動物，而要從社會制度、思想觀念、文化衝突、壓迫和歧視的結構，以及生命哲學等種種面向，來對人類自身、社會結構和意識型態進行思考。動物對她來說，絕非僅是「保護」的對象，而是活潑的生命，能為人的反思性和創造性帶來無窮的啟發。這是她在課堂、文章和演講中，希望帶給大家的體認。
2019年初，龍緣之與兩位動保伙伴合作，開始了一個名為「動保龍捲瘋」（Animal Peptalk）的多媒體計畫，三人一起錄製影音節目、討論動保議題。此計畫獲得了「文化與動物基金會」（Culture & Animals Foundation）的支持，這是動物權哲學家湯姆・雷根（Tom Regan）與夫人南希・雷根（Nancy Regan）於1985年創立的組織，鼓勵學者和藝術家對於動物權、人與動物關係促成更深刻的理解。
龍緣之介紹「動保龍捲瘋」的特色在於，針對華人社會具有爭議性的動物議題，用中文進行口語傳播，使用大眾化的語言，一如團隊的個性：「無懼於站在與主流社會對抗的立場，以思辨挖掘問題的複雜性」。她認為，節目的內容必須有趣，討論應具有開放性，並且從動物議題出發，關注其他主題的社會運動與「動物解放」之間的共通之處。
因為龍緣之經常遊走各國，「動保龍捲瘋」不只是攝影棚中的談話性節目，「我的行程都是動保之旅，只要有手機，就可在世界各地做節目，讓全球的華人觀眾能看到街頭推廣、抗爭遊行、動物收容所和養殖場，以及不同地區的人們用種種獨特的方式來表達對動物的關懷。」第一個海外特輯的節目，即鎖定影響她至深，也相對熟悉的日本。隨著她的鏡頭和介紹，讓觀眾看到了公立動物收容所、動物權利組織，參與了街推和陳抗，認識了日本的動物畫家、物種及自然保育的現況，以及與動物相關的時事議題。


2019年5月11日，一年一度的國際反圈養鯨豚日（Empty The Tanks），「日本動物權利中心」的成員們在新江之島水族館前，呼籲人們勿再觀賞海豚表演。龍緣之（右三）不只參與活動也做了網路直播，讓觀眾即時看到活動現場。Photo Credit: 龍緣之提供

無法停止的各種可能
關於動物倡議的參與方式，龍緣之的經歷可分成兩個部分，「可說」的部分從TNR、街推、陳抗，到遊說、撰寫報告和聯繫媒體等，另外就是「難以言說」的部分，被她形容是「血淚交織」的調查工作，構成了她十餘年來的生命主軸。
一直在嘗試各種社會參與形式和「戰鬥位置」的龍緣之，仍然在找尋其他可能性。取得博士學位後，她希望自己能成為獨立學者、行動者，「擁有自己的話語權和研究的獨立性，和國際及草根組織合作，推動以華人世界為主，卻與全世界相關的動物解放工作。」
想為動物做的事情太多，讓龍緣之無法停下腳步，抱著相信與懷疑、理想與務實，繼續走在旅程中，繼續觀察、思考與批判。這一路上將遇到各種人與動物的故事，在「動保龍捲瘋」的鏡頭記錄下，以及各種文章演講的發表中，就讓我們隨著她的動保之旅，一起從台灣走向國際。

Moving people from Taiwan to the world: not just for the animals, but also for a reflective citizen
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by Care for Life Association


What we want you to know is that you have been experimenting with various forms of social participation and the ""fighting position"" of Dragon Edge, and are still looking for other possibilities. After obtaining her Ph.D., she hopes that she can become an independent scholar and actor. ""I have the right to speak and study independently, and cooperate with international and grassroots organizations to promote animal liberation in the Chinese world but related to the world. jobs.""



Text: Cai Yulin
I used to catch cats TNR (Trap trapping, Neuter sterilization, Return) in the streets and lanes, but because the ex-boyfriend asked the ""chain dog"" who had leftovers to take a walk, it caused a sharp conflict between the two. In the past, surveys and publicity of ""zero fur"" and animal performances were carried out in various countries, but it was impossible to convince relatives and friends to abandon fur and meat, not to zoos and aquariums. From participating in school associations, local grassroots groups to international NGOs, Longyuan has tried various kinds of ""animal protection"" practices in many countries for more than a decade, but has also experienced fraudulent fraud and poor management. Or no longer have an ideal sports group.
""In one or two years, I really feel that I am willing to pay for the whole life and even my life for this matter."" After a predecessor committed suicide, Long Yuan took over the work of the other party and was around the clock. Investing and seeking knowledge, but in those few years, ""No night is not a bloody nightmare."" Long Yuanzhi believes that the deeper the animal protection work is, it will inevitably have a rebellious attitude towards society, because the attitude of the mainstream animal treatment of animals is embedded in the system of slave labor. When people use this as a lens, they not only show the human violence and exploitation of animals in food, clothing, housing, and travel, but also the situation of children and women, ethnic minorities, and vulnerable groups.
For the ordinary people to change, Long Yuan will not hold excessive expectations, and there are higher standards for the mobile insurance. ""When we go to film, intervene, expose farms and slaughterhouses day after day, and the circus that blatantly abuses animals, we risk our souls, suffer spiritual suffering, and mentally torture, with the intention of arousing that society may only There is a little conscience..."" Although it is a voluntary choice of this mission, if it is an actor, but does not have the courage to step into the scene or know the truth, and more people who are willing to change from eating and other behaviors, Long Yuanzhi Say: ""I don't think they are serious animal advocates.""
Long Yuanzhi, born in Taiwan in 1985, has graduated from the philosophy department of Huafan University and has gone to China to invest in the field of sports protection and more academic pursuits. In addition to studying, she also traveled around the country and exchanged and cooperated with many animal protection organizations. She is one of the few immigrants from Taiwan to the international. ""I really know that a person can be mentally broken or dragged down by the family because of his participation in the insurance or help."" For several years, she also washed her face in tears. ""I want to give up every day,"" but I go deep into the places where ordinary people don't want to think about it, even if they don't want to face it. Today, she still believes in the value of this sport and uses it as her lifelong career.
Why are there experiences and changes? In the interview, we talked about it from the beginning and reviewed her growth process together.


One of the most important partners in the growth of Long Yuan is the duck Bibi. Their home is on the side of the road, and every time her father is riding a locomotive, Bibi is always far away to hear the sound and begins to scream and echo. Everyone who returns home must play with Bibi, and it will go to sleep in a satisfied bed. Since living with Bibi, Long Yuan has been fascinated by the children's literature ""Doctor Du Lide"" and the father of animal behavior, Lawrence's book ""The Ring of King Solomon"", ""Goose Goose and Lorenz"". She used to be naive to find a duck companion for Bibi, but let Bibi and another duck ""黛黛"" (named from ""Lin Yuyu"") became a life-long grievance. It was not until 20 years later that Long Yuanzhi suddenly realized that all the ducklings that were sold as pets were male ducks that were eliminated by the farmers. Photo Credit: Long Yuanzhi

Confusion and exploration of growth
When I was young, I liked to think and read. When I was in the middle of the country, I fell in love with the movie. Long Yuanzhi wrote a film review from the age of 14. Gradually, I not only got the manuscript fee but also the free movie ticket. I can watch hundreds of movies in the cinema every year. Because of her interest in various ideas and concerns about different social cultures, she also read many realistic documentaries and began to care about feminism, abandonment, human rights, social movement and other issues, and was confused and suspicious of the meat culture.
In the growth stage, he developed the ability to observe, think and criticize. Long Yuanzhi entered the philosophy department of Huafan University and felt that it was also a matter of course. When she was in college, she watched a movie, ""The Sophistication: The Art of Killing Cats,"" which was the work of Canadian director Zev Asher in 2004, describing the three cat-killing events in the name of art. From her questioning of meat in the past, to the naked appearance of the film, the accumulation of bits and pieces, let her decide to become a vegetarian in the moment of watching the film, has not wavered.
In 2005, Teacher Zhu Zenghong (now the CEO of the Taiwan Society for Animal Society) took the class at Huafan University and established the ""Animal and Society Reading Club"" with students. At that time, Long Yuan was joined by the introduction of classmates. The teachers and students gathered once a week to discuss the ""five major"" animal issues (companion animals / stray animals, wild animals, experimental animals, zoos, economic animals). After graduating from college, this frequency of communication continued, which made her more aware of the situation of various animals.
After graduating from the Department of Philosophy, Long Yuan was admitted to the Institute of Philosophy, but she hopes to participate more deeply in social activities, especially the current state of sports in mainland China. So she went to Beijing after school, and soon met local vegetarians and immigrants. Everyone rescued animals and went to various places to carry out public welfare activities. On the other hand, she successively studied for master's and doctoral degrees at Peking University and Tsinghua University, and went to Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan for a year and a half of project research. For her, studying for a degree in colleges and universities, in addition to cultivating the theory and research ability of the dynamics, is also because of the critical thinking on social movements and NGOs, so that she can be more than just a ""monk to the monk chanting"", the same as the ""warning"" Voice tube.""
Long Yuan describes himself: ""The full-time is doing the insurance, reading is only part-time."" Nevertheless, her master's and doctoral thesis topics are related to animals. In 2010, he entered the Art School of Peking University. After three years, he completed his master's thesis: ""The ""The Movie"" is in Shanghai, and in the 1930s, the study centered on the ""Declaration"". In 2013, he entered the Institute of Science, Technology and Society of Tsinghua University, and completed his doctoral thesis five years later: ""STS Research on Giant Panda Protection"" (STS: science, technology, society).


In 2011, in the first ""Zero Fur"" propaganda of ""Action Asia"", Long Yuan invited the people to ""write a word that supports zero fur and take a photo with themselves"". The name of the event is ""Zero Fur Selfie"". She began to mobilize her relatives and friends around her. The first is the stray cats ""Kaka"" and ""Koko"" she adopted in Beijing, and the words ""No Fur"" arranged by the cat food. In fact, fur is not only from the otters, foxes and pelicans of the farm, but also from companion animals such as cats and dogs. Years later, the event developed into ""Fur Free Asia"", inviting people to make a ""zero fur gesture"" to express their support philosophy. Photo Credit: Long Yuanzhi

Into the insurance, enter the organization
After living in China and Japan for more than 10 years, Long Yuan is a practical actor in addition to studying and seeking knowledge. He has participated in the NGO group ""Activity Asia"" and ""Japan Animal Rights Center"" (Animal Right). Center Japan (ARCJ), as well as the China Zoo Watch with its college background, has also established long-term relationships with scholar-activists. Because of research, international cooperation and exchanges, she has the opportunity to travel to Europe and Asia to observe the situation of animals and animal initiatives in different societies.
Britain is widely regarded as the birthplace of the contemporary animal protection movement. Long Yuanzhi visited or internships at several animal shelters (dogs, cats, horses, farm animals, etc.), so he learned that people want to enter the local animal protection organization. Working is not an easy task. She said: ""This field has been developed for more than 100 years. The insurance has been professionalized and professionalized. The professional requirements for professionalism and staff are very high."" Compared with developing countries, in such developed countries. In the animal protection organization, the individual's personal feelings or orientation are not very important. It depends on whether the employee can be used or not. She quotes the foreign insurance partners as saying: ""In the larger group, the more employees are disposable ( Disposable after use, there are a large number of passionate young people behind.""
In the Nordic countries, Long Yuan has carried out her independent sports protection project, so it is of special significance to her. She believes that the positive interaction between local NGO workers and their social and cultural environment is worth learning: ""People have a deep understanding of the concept of public welfare. When I discuss issues with my local partners, the concerns are far more than the protection of animals. 』, but culture, society, internationalism... It is also a kind of interpersonal trust relationship that is not subject to critical thinking, but is gentle and inclusive, and belongs to the ideal. The animal initiative is a normal and dignified work. Recognized by the whole society, the people who are insured are as respectful as people and animals.""
Life-related career
In addition to the profound social participation experience in China, the animal rights movement in Japan is the opportunity for Longyuan to continue to invest and to use animal protection research as a lifelong career. During the one-and-a-half-year period of exchange students at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Long Yuanzhi also entered the ""Animal Rights Center Japan"" (ARCJ) as an intern. In fact, the opportunity to participate in Japanese social movements is far more than her expectations in Japanese universities. Every morning, she went to the Meguro area in Tokyo to attend classes. In the afternoon, she went to the streets to promote and Chen Kang together with her office partners, or went to various farms and zoos to investigate.
The regular life and full-hearted input in Japan allowed her to observe the local sports movement up close. Among them, the Japanese's ability to study and research left her with an impression that she should not be underestimated: ""Whether it is research, speech activities, or the publication of research reports, there are always many volunteers or people who are willing to pay to study. Although Japan There are not many animal rights groups, small scale and reduced manpower, but they can accomplish amazing workloads.” According to Long Yuan, most of the animal rights groups in Japan maintain organizational operations with membership. Take ARCJ as an example. 300 people, only one or two members in agricultural counties such as Akita and Aomori.
She once had a deep impression on her sharing session. The presenter Kaji is a volunteer with more than 30 years of experience. Since 1985, the animal rights group has been involved in the grassroots in Japan, and the old gentleman recalled the past with tears. The audience also focused on listening, and the sincere emotion touched the hearts of the people. In the view of Long Yuan, these seniors who work day and night in the office, are afraid of the sun on the streets and ridicule others, are admired for their enthusiasm for ideals, and have a continuous and reflective learning spirit. It is the greatest warmth and hope in the Japanese society where material wealth is abundant, people are cold, and the population is more than 200 million, but the supporters of animal advocates are few.


In September 2012, in Shenzhen, China, Act Asia invited various insurance groups and university insurance associations to launch a two-day “Rejection of Bloody Fur Workshop and the 7th China Animal Protection Training Camp”. ""Action Asia"" was the first group to advocate for fur issues in China. Long Yuanzhi (third from the left in the back row) was the ""Action Asia"" Beijing representative and the Zero Fur Project Commissioner. He explained the basic concepts of fur in the training camp. Consumers need to know, how to identify true and false fur, and so on. Photo Credit: Long Yuanzhi

Regarding the current situation of China's insurance, Longyuan believes that it is still in its infancy. Although many international organizations have entered China, they have used excessive mainstream marketing methods to protect them. For example, please ask stars or entrepreneurs to take endorsements and purchase media layouts. Although Long Yuanzhi is inevitably involved, he also holds a certain critical position. What she wants to explore is: ""An animal initiative as an integral part of the social movement, where is its subjectivity?"" Her personality is pragmatic, but insisting that the movement should retain a part of the ideal: ""Not just for the animals, but also Be a reflective citizen.""
Born in a philosophical background, Long Yuanzhi emphasizes the investigation and research of animal protection. It can not only stop the literature review and philosophical thinking, but spend a lot of time on the field field to understand the problem in a multi-perspective and comprehensive way. To cultivate your own acumen of the issue, ""use life to get involved."" Long Yuanzhi has conducted research and travel in more than ten countries. In her view, Taiwan is a ""model"" for the Asian region.
""Taiwan is the place where I feel that I can see and hear the most relevant information in life. I have no animal experiment supplies, animal-friendly products that are as friendly as possible, and vegetarian restaurants and food. Many and good quality. Many stores are also willing to post or place promotional materials."" She believes that Taiwan's openness is high, and may be used as a model and experimental case field. However, it is precisely because of the small size of the market and the limitations of the market. The history, situation and potential influence of animal protection progress have disadvantages that are easily overlooked by the international community.
How to move forward and expand
In the fall of 2018, Long Yuan returned to his alma mater, Hua Fan University, to participate in the course of the philosophy department ""Buddhist NPO and Humanistic Care"". The course does not seem to have anything to do with the name of the course, but because of her interest in animal issues and ethics, this class is often discussing various animal-related issues. The students are also very concerned about the animal's situation and ethical controversy. The reason is described as ""it is going to be an insured class.""
She believes that animal studies can never stop talking about animals, but from the social system, ideas, cultural conflicts, the structure of oppression and discrimination, and the philosophy of life, to human beings, social structures and Think about ideology. For her, animals are not only the object of ""protection"", but a lively life, which can bring infinite inspiration to people's reflection and creativity. This is what she hopes to bring to everyone in class, articles and speeches.
At the beginning of 2019, Long Yuanzhi and two dynamic insurance partners started a multimedia project called ""Animal Peptalk"". The three people recorded audio and video programs and discussed the issue of motion protection. The project was supported by the Culture & Animals Foundation, founded in 1985 by the animal rights philosopher Tom Regan and his wife Nancy Regan. The organization encourages scholars and artists to develop a deeper understanding of animal rights, human-animal relationships.
The introduction of Longyuan is characterized by the controversial animal issues of Chinese society, the use of spoken language in Chinese, and the use of popular language, just like the personality of the team: ""No fear of standing and mainstream The position of social confrontation is to speculate on the complexity of the problem."" She believes that the content of the program must be interesting, the discussion should be open, and from the animal issue, focus on the commonalities between social movements of other themes and ""animal liberation.""
Because Long Yuan often travels around the country, ""Moving the Dragon"" is not just a talk show in the studio. ""My itinerary is a journey of insurance. If you have a mobile phone, you can do programs around the world, let the world The Chinese audience can see street promotion, protest marches, animal shelters and farms, and people from different regions express their care for animals in a variety of unique ways.” The first overseas special program, that is, the lock affects her to Deep, also relatively familiar with Japan.

Unable to stop all kinds of possibilities
Regarding the way the animal initiative is involved, Long Yuan’s experience can be divided into two parts. The “speakable” part is from TNR, street push, Chen Kang, to lobbying, writing reports and contacting the media, etc., and the other is “unspeakable”. In part, she described the investigation work of ""blood and tears intertwined"", which constitutes the main axis of her life for more than ten years.
The Longmen, which has been experimenting with various forms of social participation and ""combat positions,"" is still looking for other possibilities. After obtaining her Ph.D., she hopes that she can become an independent scholar and actor. ""I have the right to speak and study independently, and cooperate with international and grassroots organizations to promote animal liberation in the Chinese world but related to the world. jobs.""
I want to do too many things for animals, so that Long Yuan can't stop, hold faith and doubt, ideal and pragmatism, continue to walk on the journey, continue to observe, think and criticize. On this road, we will encounter stories of various people and animals. In the record of ""Moving the Dragon"", and the publication of various articles, let us move from Taiwan along with her travel journey. International.
