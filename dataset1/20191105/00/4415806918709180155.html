      <p>A new range of cancer tests has been developed, which scientists hope will help research of the disease and get more patients on clinical trials.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow Cancer Tests are a suite of affordable solid tumour and blood cancer tests designed to be used in routine healthcare, such as the NHS, around the world.</p>
      <p>It would open up the latest treatments and trials to cancer patients and also help scientists discover what makes cancer resistant to chemotherapy drugs.</p>
      <blockquote>This test will enable patients around the world to access the best treatments for their cancer</blockquote>
      <p>Professor Andrew Biankin is regius professor of surgery at the University of Glasgow and director of the Glasgow Precision Oncology Laboratory (GPOL), where the tests have been developed.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Glasgow Cancer Tests were created so that ultimately every patient with cancer could have access to the latest treatments and clinical trials.</p>
      <p>“Our team of inventors, including Susie Cooke, Philip Beer and David Chang, have dedicated the last five years of their lives to creating the Glasgow Cancer test.</p>
      <p>“This test will enable patients around the world to access the best treatments for their cancer.</p>
      <p>“I’m extremely proud of what the team have done and where this might take us for healthcare in the future.”</p>

      <p>The Glasgow Cancer Tests analyse genetic code from a sample of a patient’s cancer to look for biological markers that could indicate which trial drugs would work and which would not – and how the cancer has developed in the first place.</p>
      <p>They are currently being evaluated by NHS labs in England and Scotland while also being used in a University of Glasgow-led Precision-Panc clinical trials programme for patients with pancreatic cancer.</p>
      <p>Dr Susie Cooke, head of medical genomics at GPOL, said: “The challenge has been to work out how to extract the maximum amount of information about a cancer sample from a small, affordable assay and a small amount of sample material.</p>
      <p>“It’s vital to have a test that provides what the patient and physician need in the real world, rather than one that has requirements that are unlikely to be met in day-to-day healthcare.</p>
      <p>“The test also needs to cover the full range of information present in a cancer’s DNA so that every option can be explored for every patient.</p>
      <p>“We want to make it much easier for patients to get on to clinical trials and for companies to run more trials and offer more trial options to patients.</p>
      <p>“The Glasgow Cancer Tests can enable that.”</p>
