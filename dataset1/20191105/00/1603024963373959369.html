      <p>Attacking 'intellectuals who eat beef', West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party president Dilip Ghosh said on November 4 that they should be asked to eat dog meat too.</p>
      <p>Carrying on with his scathing remarks, the state BJP chief urged them to eat all the different kinds of meat that do not “affect their health” at home.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media, Ghosh said: “Few intellectuals eat beef on roads, I tell them to eat dog meat too, their health will be fine whichever animal they eat, but why on roads? Eat at your home.”</p>

      <p>He was speaking at an event marking the “Gopa Ashtami Karyakram” in West Bengal’s Burdwan district when he dubbed such acts as “maha aparadh (grave sin)”.</p>
      <p>The controversial remarks were aimed at certain people who consume beef at roadside stalls but take immense pride in “cleaning the dump of their foreign pets”, said a <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/politics/dilip-ghosh-makes-bizarre-remarks-talks-about-golden-milk-asks-beef-eaters-to-have-dog-meat-2373753.html">report by News18</a>.</p>
      <p>Dilip Ghosh further said: “Cow is our mother; we stay alive by consuming cow milk. So, if anyone misbehaves with my mother, I will treat them the way they should be treated. On the holy soil of India, killing cows and consuming beef is a crime.”</p>
      <p>While making these statements, he also made a bizarre claim that the milk produced by Indian cows contains gold, which imparts it the yellow undertone.</p>
      <p>He added: "There is a blood vessel in desi cows that helps produce gold with the help of sunlight. So, we have to keep those cows. If we drink <i>desi</i> cow milk, we will become healthy."</p>
      <p>Ghosh, who is for making such contentious and weird remarks, also said that “only desi cows are our mother, not the videshi (foreign) ones”.</p>
      <p>He claimed: "The breeds of cows that we bring from abroad are not cows. They are a kind of '<i>janwar</i>' (beast). Those are not our mother but our aunties. We should not worship such aunties."<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
