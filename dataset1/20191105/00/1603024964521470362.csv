The government may discontinue spending on 200-odd schemes in order to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.
The report noted that these schemes would be having a non-prirotity status, and that government was carrying out a token spend on these schemes. The report also noted that the impact of discontinuing these schemes would likely be reflected in the budget for FY21.
State governments are likely to have been notified of the step as they ultimately implement the schemes that receive the funding from the Centre, the report noted.
