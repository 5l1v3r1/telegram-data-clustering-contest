      <p>DOVER, Del. (AP) - A former custodian accused of shooting a man to death outside of a Delaware elementary school testified during his trial that the victim had been harassing him prior to the confrontation.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 54-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-west/">Rodney West</a> took the stand Monday and said 39-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/derrick-combs/">Derrick Combs</a> had stalked him, slashed his tires and consistently sent him harassing text messages before the 2018 shooting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-west/">West</a> is accused of fatally shooting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/derrick-combs/">Combs</a> outside of the Dover school where <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-west/">West</a> worked. Police said no students were there at the time.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have said the dispute stemmed from text messages exchanged between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-west/">West</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/derrick-combs/">Combs</a>‘ wife, who also worked at the school.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-west/">West</a> previously declined a manslaughter plea deal and maintains he acted in self-defense. His attorney argues he thought <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/derrick-combs/">Combs</a> may’ve been armed.</p>
