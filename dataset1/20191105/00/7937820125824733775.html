        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03230-y">It’s official: US wants out of Paris accord</a>
      </h3>
      <p>The United States has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03230-y">officially announced its intention to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement</a>. Way back in June 2017, President Donald Trump said he would take the country out, but yesterday was the earliest date the rules allowed it. The Trump administration argues that the agreement harms the country’s economic competitiveness, while critics say the United States is isolating itself from the global push towards a low-carbon economy. The actual withdrawal will happen in a year on 4 November 2020 — one day after the next US presidential election. If a pro-Paris candidate wins then, the country could be back in the pact in 30 days.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The genomes of Africans who were liberated from slave ships and taken to the remote island of St Helena are offering clues about their origins in Africa. Twenty partial genomes from those who died on St Helena reveal that they are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03152-9">most closely related to people living today in central Gabon and northern Angola</a>, but gaps in present-day genome data from parts of Africa make it difficult to say for certain. None of the people were closely related, nor did they belong to a single African population, suggesting that they lived in a challenging multicultural setting.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus</i>) journey farther than any other land mammal on their annual migration, with some herds <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03373-y">covering more than 1,200 kilometres in a round trip</a>. But the prize for most kilometres covered in a year went to a grey wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) from Mongolia that covered a jaw-dropping 7,247 km in a single year.</p>

      <p>Genome editing has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03284-y">made one of the world’s most important crops resistant to a devastating bacterial infection</a>. Researchers have used CRISPR to generate rice plants that are broadly resistant to the main pathogen that causes rice blight, <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae </i>(<i>Xoo</i>).</p>

      <p>“The history of science tells us that some of the toughest questions will be addressed not by being answered but by being replaced with better questions,” argues science writer Philip Ball. He lays out why research cannot <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03307-8">fulfil its social contract and reach new horizons</a> by advancing on the same footing into the future.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In 1938, botanists Elzada Clover and Lois Jotter <a href="https://magazine.atavist.com/the-wild-ones-grand-canyon-colorado-river-first-women">set out on the Colorado River to catalogue the Grand Canyon’s cacti</a>. It was a journey considered too dangerous for almost anyone, let alone two women. They disagreed. “Just because the only other woman who ever attempted this trip was drowned,” said Jotter, “is no reason women have any more to fear than men.”</p>
