      <p>Last week during its six months earnings report, Nintendo <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/nintendo_finally_hints_that_it_has_ditched_game_development_on_the_3ds">hinted</a> it would no longer develop first-party games for the 3DS. From here on out, the plan is to rely on evergreen titles to sustain system sales.</p>
      <p>In terms of technical support for the system itself – nothing has changed. In fact, yesterday, a new system update was rolled out. This new firmware update – Version 11.12.0-44 – is the same as always:</p>
      <blockquote>Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.</blockquote>
      <p>To manually update your 3DS, head over to the System Settings within the device, select System Update from within the menu and then tap OK to begin.</p>
