      <p>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) - South America’s soccer body CONMEBOL has moved the Copa Libertadores final from Santiago to Lima because of a weekslong wave of demonstrations in the Chilean capital.</p>
      <p>CONMEBOL announced the decision on Tuesday after a meeting with representatives of the two finalists - defending champion River Plate of Argentina and Brazil’s Flamengo.</p>
      <p>The one-leg final remains scheduled for Nov. 23, but now in Peru’s capital instead of Santiago’s Estadio Nacional stadium.</p>
      <p>Chile has been in political turmoil for almost 20 days since demonstrations began last month after the government announced a hike in subway fares. The protests have expanded to include demands over education, health services and economic inequality.</p>
      <p>Last year, the deciding Copa Libertadores game between River and archrivals Boca Juniors had to be moved to Madrid because of violent incidents in Buenos Aires. River won 3-1 at Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu stadium.</p>
