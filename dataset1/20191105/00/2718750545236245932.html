      <h1><i>Mayans M.C.</i> Is Staying in Business on FX for Season 3 Even If Kurt Sutter Isn’t</h1>

      <p>In <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/southpaw-screenwriter-kurt-sutter.html">Kurt Sutter’s</a> farewell <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kurt-sutter-fired-mayans-mc-abrasive-dick.html">email to</a> the people who make the show <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/mayans-mc-tv-review.html"><i>Mayans M.C.</i></a><i>,</i> he said that he didn’t know what FX had in store for the series but that co-creator and executive producer <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/mayans-mc-elgin-james-interview.html">Elgin James</a> “is ready to take on the challenge of running the show.” It turns out the network officially agrees. FX renewed <i>Mayans </i>for a third season today, despite firing Sutter recently, and James will step up and take over as showrunner. So that’s great news for everyone who gets to keep working on the <i>Sons of Anarchy </i>spinoff.</p>
