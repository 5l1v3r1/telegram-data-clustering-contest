      <h1>How much is Saudi Aramco worth?</h1>

      <p><b>Ahead of its stock market listing, oil firm’s valuations vary by more than $1trillion<br/><br/>RIYADH</b> Valuations for Saudi Aramco vary by more than $1 trillion, according to fund managers who have seen banks’ research, underscoring the uncertainty hanging over what could be the world’s largest stock market listing. <br/><br/>Fund managers are poring over bank research after Aramco on Sunday announced its intention to float on the Riyadh stock market. <br/><br/>Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. On Sunday, however, Aramco provided no size of the planned IPO, no timeframe, identified no cornerstone investors and gave no information on an expected follow-up listing overseas. <br/><br/>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has spoken of a $2 trillion value target for the world’s largest oil producer while banks have provided varying figures. <br/><br/><br/>Bank of America (BOFA) Merrill Lynch estimates Aramco's valuation at $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion while EFG Hermes has a valuation of $1.55 trillion to $2.1trillion, two fund managers who have seen the research reports said. <br/><br/>Goldman Sachs – one of the banks coordinating the IPO - has put the company's valuation between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion, two sources said. Bernstein analysts estimated "a fair value range" for Saudi Aramco is $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. “Our discounted cash flow approaches... suggest $1.4 trillion on average,” it said. <br/><br/><br/>BOFA Merrill's has also used the discounted cash flow model, a valuation methodology that uses future cash flow, according to one fund manager who saw the research. The banks were not immediately available for comment.</p>
