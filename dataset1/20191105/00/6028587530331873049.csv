While most companies in cannabis-friendly cities across the country—with the exception of West Hollywood—are still trying to navigate the confusion surrounding social consumption regulations, one workaround is through hosting official tours and bespoke experiences. As the first metropolis to make marijuana legal for adult-use, Denver, Colorado, has one of the most extensive selections of organized outings compared to locales like Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Whether you’re a seasoned enthusiast or a canna-curious tourist, here are the six best tour operators to try in the Mile High City.
Cultivating Spirits

Cannabis culinary expert Philip Wolf pioneered the art of pairing the plant with food and wine, forming Cultivating Spirits in 2014. Specializing in a three-course dining experience and working with a rotating roster of Colorado top chefs, his goal is to celebrate smoking cannabis instead of infusing with it. Each course is served with a different strain complementary to each dish, while Wolf acts as a cannabis sommelier to take you through the tasting notes of both the flower and food. cultivatingspirits.com
