      <p>In the broader market – the S&amp;P BSE Midcap fell 1.13 percent while the S&amp;P BSE Smallcap was down 0.8 percent.</p>
      <p>The big question in front of investors is --- have we topped out? Going by technical charts, there are signs of a slowdown in momentum but if the index manages to hold above crucial support levels such as 11,880-11,900, Nifty has a chance of hitting 12K.</p>
      <p>"Nifty took resistance near 12k zone for the third consecutive session and closed the day at 11,917, with a loss of 24 points, forming Hanging Man candle pattern on daily chart, hinting some negative reversal in the coming session if able to break 11,850 zone," Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.</p>
      <p>"Now, the index has good support near 11,850-11,800 zone any break below 11,850 zone can see some more cuts in the index and immediate resistance is coming near 11,950-12,000 mark. Bulls will get active again if index managed to breach 12k zone," he said.</p>
      <p>On the macro front, activity in India's dominant services industry contracted for the second consecutive month in October due to muted demand, driving business optimism to a near-three year low, a private business survey showed.</p>
      <p>"Consolidation is seen in the market and for stability, we need further developments in global trade policies and fresh stimulus from the government. Further, contraction in service PMI in October due to muted demand influenced investors to turn cautious,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd told Moneyconrtol.</p>
      <p>“Based on ongoing result outcome investors are focusing on quality stocks while Mid &amp; Small are underperforming," he said.</p>
      <p>On the global front, China is pushing US President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September as part of a “phase one” US-China trade deal, reported Reuters, quoting people familiar with the negotiations.</p>
