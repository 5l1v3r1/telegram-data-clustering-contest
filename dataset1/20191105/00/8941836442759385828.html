      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - U.S. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ben-ray-lujan/">Rep. Ben Ray Luján</a> says his Senate election bid in 2020 has the support of New Mexico’s two current senators.</p>
      <p>In a statement Monday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ben-ray-lujan/">Luján</a> announced endorsements of his campaign by retiring Sen. Tom Udall and second-term Sen. Martin Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Leading Democrats are falling in line behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ben-ray-lujan/">Luján</a> as the only Democratic contender to replace Udall after Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver dropped out of the race last week.</p>
      <p>Republican contractor Mick Rich and college professor Gavin Clarkson are pursuing the GOP nomination for Senate. They both lost statewide elections in 2018.</p>
