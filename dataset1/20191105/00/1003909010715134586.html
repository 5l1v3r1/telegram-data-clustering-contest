      <p>Calgary students paid tribute to veterans at two local cemeteries on Monday through the ‘No Stone Left Alone’ program.</p>
      <p>The memorial foundation behind the program aims to build awareness of military service and sacrifice by bringing students to cemeteries and cenotaphs to place a poppy, and sometimes meet veterans.</p>
      <p>On Monday, about 900 students from five Calgary schools took part in ceremonies at Burnsland and Queen’s Park Cemeteries.</p>
      <p>Last year the organization worked with over 9,000 students across Canada, holding events in 105 cemeteries across Canada. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.nostoneleftalone.ca/">No Stone Left Alone Website</a>.</p>
