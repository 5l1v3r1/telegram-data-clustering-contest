Stephen Strasburg, World Series MVP, calls out ‘fake news’
05 Nov 2019 by Jessica Chasmar
Washington Nationals pitcher and World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg issued his first tweet in 18 months to call out “fake news” after a now-viral video appeared to show him snubbing President Trump’s handshake during his team White House visit on Monday.
Mr. Strasburg retweeted a 10-second clip that showed him concluding his speech at the White House and then seemingly ignoring Mr. Trump’s extended hand.
The clip, posted by Twitter user Rudy Gersten, titled, “Strasburg left Trump hanging,” has racked up more than 2 million views.
“#FakeNews,” Mr. Strasburg wrote above the retweeted video.





A 19-second clip of the interaction later posted by the Washington Free Beacon’s David Rutz clearly showed Mr. Strasburg eventually shaking hands with Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump.
Mr. Gersten replied with “The fakest news, but still made me laugh. Thanks for everything Stras.”

Mr. Gersten responded to criticism by insisting he is a “lifelong conservative Republican” and that his video was meant to be lighthearted.
