      <h1>Fake News Buster: Girl collecting oil in Ayodhya is not a Aohingya</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:30:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p><b>THE FAKE</b> <br/>After the picture of a girl collecting oil from diyas on Diwali night in Ayodhya became popular on Twitter, a Facebook post identified her as a Rohingya refugee who was photographed in Bangladesh two years ago. The post claims that the picture is staged and the girl was brought to Ayodhya as part of a conspiracy, only for spreading propaganda against the Diwali ‘Deepotsav’ organised by the UP government. <br/><br/><br/><b>SO, WHAT’S THE TRUTH?</b> <br/>The post is false and a closer look at both the pictures reveals that there is hardly any resemblance between the two girls.</p>
