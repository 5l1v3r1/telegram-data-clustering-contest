It's the busiest shopping day of the year, as shoppers line up to try and snag crazy deals on the products they've been looking at all year long. It's become a holiday of its own for bargain hunters and extreme shoppers. Considering that the best deals on electronics are often found online anyway, do you really want to brave the lines?While Black Friday is a great time to stock up on electronics, some retailers announce massive deals at the beginning of November. We've gone through the early Black Friday deals on tech to find the most exceptional bargains on laptops, home audio and cameras to help you spring on these deals while they last.

Canon E05 Rebel T6 DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm IS II and EF 75-300mm III lens


Canon - EOS Rebel T6 DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm IS II and EF 75-300mm III lens - Black

The Canon E05 Rebel is one of the most popular DSLRs on the market and for good reason. Its rugged, reliable build combined with smooth, intuitive hardware makes for a camera that can shoot anything from Wedding or Portrait Photography to Sports or Fashion. It even films video at 1080p HD resolution, so you can shoot behind-the-scenes film of your photoshoots or start your own YouTube channel.  
The Canon E05 Rebel is also known for its reasonable price point, making it a favorite for smartphone photographers looking to join the world of DSLRs. Now it's even cheaper to do so, as you can save $150 on the Canon EO5 on Amazon.
This bundle deals also comes with 18-55mm lens and a 75-300mm, meaning you can shoot both close-ups as well as long distances straight out of the box. A carrying sweetens the deal, as far as accessories go. As if this weren't enough, they're throwing in a free 32GB memory card. DSLRs use up a lot of memory, so you'll be needing that.

GoPro Hero7 Black



GoPro HERO 7 Black

The GoPro Hero7 Black may be marketed as an action cam, but in reality, it’s an excellent camera for any occasion. The camera is capable of recording video at 4K at 60 frames per second or 1,080p at up to an impressive 240 frames per second. That’s perfect for capturing those high-movement shots.
The camera is ultra-portable too. It measures in at only 2.44 inches wide and 1.26 inches thick and has a built-in gyroscope to help ensure that footage is relatively shake-free, and once you’re done recording, it’s easy to transfer your footage using the accompanying app.
The GoPro Hero7 Black is available from Amazon for $326, which is $74 off its normal price of $400. That marks one of the best discounts we’ve seen for the camera so far.
