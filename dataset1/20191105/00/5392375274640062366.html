      <p>Chinese tech titan – Xiaomi is all set to unveil the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/28/xiaomi-mi-cc9-pro-with-penta-camera-setup-to-be-unveiled-on-november-5/">Mi CC9 Pro smartphone</a>, the<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/28/xiaomi-tv-5-annual-flagship-to-arrive-on-november-5/"> Mi TV 5</a>, and the Mi Watch in a few hours time. In true Xiaomi’s fashion, the firm has been actively drip-feeding us with bits of information, so there is virtually nothing we already do not know about these devices.</p>
      <p>So far, official image and video renders released by Xiaomi suggests the upcoming watch bears a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/30/miui-for-watch/">striking resemblance to the Apple Watch</a>. While that seems like a turn off for a number of fans, hard-core fans are all aware the Xiaomi brand is founded on copying everything Apple.</p>

According to serial leaker and blogger @Digital Chat Station, the Xiaomi Watch Pro will come with a completely new circular design, and not based on the Apple Watch model. a circular dial.

      <p>How exactly the Xiaomi WatchPro differs from the Mi Watch outside of the design has yet to be revealed. However, there are speculations it might get a beefier battery, more RAM, storage, and perhaps, a more powerful processor. Apparently, it will be priced more than the standard Mi Watch which the tipster claims would sell at  ¥1299 (~$185), so the Xiaomi Watch Pro come with a price tag of about $200.</p>
