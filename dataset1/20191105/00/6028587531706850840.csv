Topline: Astronaut Andrew “Drew” Morgan voted in Tuesday’s election while in orbit 250 miles above Earth, thanks to a team effort between NASA and Lawrence County, Pennsylvania’s department of voter services.

Morgan, who is registered to vote in Lawrence County, mailed an absentee ballot application in the spring and indicated his location would be the “International Space Station, low Earth orbit” on Election Day.
Lawrence County voting services director Ed Allison said he was initially skeptical of Morgan’s application, until he began receiving phone calls from NASA to make arrangements.
In order for Morgan to vote securely, Lawrence County’s director of IT created a secure email address and password.
A “fillable PDF” file was created to be Morgan’s ballot⁠—all he had to do was click the circle next to the name of the candidate he wanted to vote for.
When it came time for Morgan to cast his vote, the ballot was sent to him in one email while a second email contained a secure password only he would have.
The entire process took one month from start to finish, according to local paper the New Castle News. 

Crucial quote: Morgan made sure to send a thank-you note from space: “Dear Mr. Allison: Thank you for facilitating my vote from on board the International Space Station. Cordially, Andrew R. Morgan, COL, US Army, US Segment Lead, International Space Station.”
Key background: Texas passed a law in 1997 (signed by then-governor George W. Bush) that allowed astronauts to vote from space. Most astronauts live in Houston, where NASA’s Johnson’s Space Center is located⁠—which is why Texas passed the voting law. According to NASA’s Tumblr, astronauts must indicate which elections they will participate in a year before launch. “It's something that, you know, you might or might not expect it to mean a great deal. But when you're so removed from your planet, small things do have a large impact,” said David Wolf, the first astronaut to vote from space, in a 2008 NPR interview. Wolf voted from the Russian Mir Space Station in 1997. 
Tangent: Despite concerns that voter suppression is widespread throughout the country, the topic hasn’t come up in the past 31 consecutive presidential debates.
