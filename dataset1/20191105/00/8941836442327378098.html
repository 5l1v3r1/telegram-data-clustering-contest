      <p>SEATTLE (AP) - Washington state authorities say a software engineer who pleaded not guilty to deferral computer and wire fraud charges in a Capital One hack was released from jail on bond.</p>
      <p>KING-TV reported Monday that 33-year-old Paige Thompson was granted bond Monday.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Thompson is expected to live in a halfway house upon release. She would be required to wear a GPS monitor and would be prohibited from using computers or the internet.</p>
