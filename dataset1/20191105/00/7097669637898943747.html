      <h1>Stealth Killer: The Su-35 Might Be Too Effective For Its Own Good</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>It's about long-term differences.</p>
      <p>“A unique machine, a deadly aerial fist,” is how the official television channel of the Russian Ministry of Defense introduced the Su-35S superiority fighter earlier this week.</p>
      <p>TV Zvezda’s <u><a href="https://tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/201903210718-u2gq.htm">three-minute</a></u> clip of a recent Su-35S training sortie over Syria provides close-up shots of the fighter jet being prepped for flight, taking off, cruising over the Syrian coast, and firing flares. On their <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Aq4_6YG5iw&amp;t=47s">youtube account</a></u>, they published slightly extended footage of the same exercise.</p>
      <p>The first Su-35S fighters arrived at Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in 2016, relatively late into the Syrian Civil War. They <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-su-35-fighter-needs-enemy-kill-39887">performed well</a></u> in their role of covering for Russian ground-strike aircraft during bombing missions against Syrian opposition targets, but then again-- there were no immediate airspace threats facing the Russia’s Syrian forces in early 2016. The Su-35S was therefore limited to an air deterrence role amid an ongoing <u><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/putins-winning-in-syria-but-making-a-powerful-new-enemy/">diplomatic row </a></u>between Moscow and Ankara that wound down only in the latter half of 2016.</p>
      <p>Today, airpower continues to be the crucial military ingredient in the enforcement of Russian “de-escalation zones” strewn across the western parts of Syria, and in intermittent bombing runs against opposition stragglers and ISIS targets.</p>
      <p>From the conflict’s earliest days through 2019, the Syrian venture continues to yield military value as a training and proving grounds for the next generation of Russian servicemen. As a Su-35S pilot told Zvezda, “here, we can realize the potential of the aircraft-- the tactical potential. For every pilot and co-pilot, this is a tremendous opportunity to hone their skills.” In a less covered but no less important development, it also provides Russian engineers with aircraft maintenance know-how after real, albeit low-intensity, combat missions.</p>
      <p>Barring a brief and nondescript <u><a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/11/19/russian-military-unveils-video-footage-new-su-57-stealth-fights-syria-a63532">Su-57 outing</a></u>, the Su-35S is among the most advanced Russian military aircraft to be deployed in Syria. As a deep modernization of the prolific Soviet-era Su-27 fighter, the Su-35S boasts updated avionics (onboard electronics), a new lightweight frame, and 3d thrust vectoring capability, and vastly more expanded armament suite. Notably, the latter includes <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/could-russias-r-77-missile-crush-the-us-air-force-war-23454">Vympel R-77</a></u> air-to-air missiles that are meant to compete favorably with the US AIM-120 AMRAAM platform, and an air-launched anti-ship variant of Russia’s prolific <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-dangerous-%E2%80%9Ckalibr%E2%80%9D-cruise-missile-could-see-range-doubled-report-41427">Kalibr cruise missiles</a></u>. </p>
      <p>The Su-35S was intended as an interim solution; as a modernized air superiority fighter to sustain the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) through the 2010’s until the Su-57 fifth-generation stealth fighter enters serial production. But the Su-35S was almost too successful for its own good, ticking so many performance and role versatility boxes that it seems to cannibalize its more expensive Su-57 successor. In the short term, it’s likely true that there will be<u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/death-match-russias-stealth-su-57-vs-su-35s-flanker-e-who-26024"> a minimal operational difference</a></u> between the latest Su-35S units and the first serially-produced Su-57’s. As it currently stands, there is <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/here-comes-stealth-russias-su-57-almost-here-47922">even a chance</a></u> that the two fighters may use the same AL-41F1 engine.</p>
      <p>But as is typically the case with next-generation platforms, the VKS is not concerned with immediate value. Rather, they see the Su-57 as a long-term investment that will incrementally phase out older aircraft to become Russia’s staple air superiority platform over the coming decades. In the meantime, the Su-35S continues to occupy the upper echelons of Russian aerospace design as the VKS’ top air superiority fighter.</p>
