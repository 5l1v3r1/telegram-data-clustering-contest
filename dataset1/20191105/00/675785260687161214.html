      <h1>Sergio Aguero explains why Man City care more about Man Utd than Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola's side travel to Anfield to face the league leaders on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:50:10+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 00:50</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Sergio Aguero has insisted that Manchester City still consider <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> as the club's biggest rivals, despite admitting that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are their main title challengers.</p>
      <p>The defending champions travel to Anfield on Sunday looking to close the gap on Jurgen Klopp's side, who currently hold a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>It is set to be second season in a row that the two clubs will be involved in a tight contest for the title, after Pep Guardiola's side narrowly beat the Merseyside club to the league championship by a single point last season.</p>
      <p>And although Liverpool's recent success has seen them develop a strong rivalry with City, Aguero is adamant that his side still consider their meetings with local rivals United to be more important.</p>

      <p>“It may be the clasico for television, but for us, the clasico, it’s the match against United," the Argentina international told <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/sergio-aguero-says-liverpool-can-hurt-city-man-united-match-still-important/">France Football (via Sport Witness).</a></p>
      <p>"Liverpool has always been a tough opponent. But when I arrived, the team we were fighting for the title was United.</p>
      <p>"Initially, it was something strange in the city that City competes against United. Then there was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ."</p>
      <p>The prolific striker, who has scored nine league goals this season, continued: "But these last four seasons, Liverpool have become a very strong team and are now fighting with us to win the Premier League.</p>

      <p>"It’s the only team in the league that can hurt us. They have been chasing a new league (title) for years.</p>
      <p>"Last season, they didn’t go all the way, so they are very motivated. This year, they are in front of us and will try to go to the end.”</p>
      <p>Although they overturned a larger points deficit to win the title last season, Guardiola's side head into Sunday's meeting knowing that defeat would put Liverpool firmly in the driving seat.</p>

      <p>City haven't won at Anfield since 2003 and come up against a side that is yet to lose in the league this season, with their only two dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Addressing the weekend's trip, Aguero added: “We know that this is a ground where it’s very difficult to win, but we’ll try to do it because it has been a long time since the club last won there.</p>
      <p>"This will be a key match for the title.”</p>
