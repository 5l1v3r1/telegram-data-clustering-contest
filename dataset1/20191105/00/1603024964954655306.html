      <p>The Indian startup ecosystem is expected to create around 50 lakh jobs by 2025 directly and indirectly, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) has said in a report released on November 5.</p>
      <p>Speaking to mediapersons, NASSCOM president Debjani Ghosh said by 2025, the ecosystem will create 11 lakh direct jobs and 39 lakh indirect jobs.</p>
      <p>The report, Indian Startup Ecosystem, says that startups created 60,000 direct and 1.3-1.8 lakh jobs in 2019 compared to 40,000 direct jobs in 2018.</p>

      <p>The number of tech startups has gone up from 7,700-8,200 in 2018 to 8,900-9,300 in 2019. Of these, 28 percent are deep tech startups.</p>
      <p>The unicorn club, too, has expanded, from 17 in 2018 to 24 in 2019 and a few more were likely to join in by the year-end.</p>
      <p>More corporates are showing interest in the sector. As many as 80 corporate investors bet on the sector, a 10 percent increase over 2018.</p>
      <p>Ghosh identified access to markets and funds as the biggest challenges, saying “The government has a critical role to play here”.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
