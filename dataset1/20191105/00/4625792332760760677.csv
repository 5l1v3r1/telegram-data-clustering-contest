Giuliani associate signals readiness to cooperate with Trump impeachment effort
05 Nov 2019, 00:09 by Daniel Chaitin
An associate of Rudy Giuliani has a new attitude toward cooperating with the House impeachment effort against President Trump.
The lawyer for Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian American indicted for illegal campaign donations, told Reuters his client has reversed his prior decision to reject a request from three House committees.
“We will honor and not avoid the committee’s requests to the extent they are legally proper while scrupulously protecting Mr. Parnas’ privileges, including that of the Fifth Amendment,” said the lawyer Joseph Bondy.
Parnas' previous lawyer, former Trump attorney John Dowd, informed the House panels that their request for documents was “overly broad and unduly burdensome.”
Parnas and another man, Igor Fruman, helped Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, in his effort to get Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and debunked allegations of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. Parnas and Fruman and two other businessmen, Andrey Kukuskin and David Correia, have pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court to the allegations that they funneled foreign donations into United States elections.
House impeachment proceedings, being led by the majority Democrats, are looking into Trump's push for Ukraine to conduct investigations that would be politically beneficial to him.
