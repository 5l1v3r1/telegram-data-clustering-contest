Furthermore, with live sales from Amazon and from Walmart increasing the pressure, we now have a good idea about Best Buy’s doorbuster Black Friday plans...

Best Buy Black Friday 2019 Shipping Policy

For starters, Best Buy has stepping things up for Black Friday 2019 which an upgraded shipping policy which matches top dog Target with free, fast shipping on every item with no minimum. The deal, in particular, puts Walmart to shame.

Best Buy Black Friday 2019: Expected Sales

Interestingly, Best Buy already has savings for big-ticket items like AirPods, Galaxy smartphones, consoles and premium TVs. The big omission is iPhones while I also expect deals for new consoles to replace the refurbished units right now, making these the doorbuster deals you should look out for during Best Buy’s Black Friday 2019 sales: 

Apple iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max - $250 direct savings when activating a new instalment plan (Walmart will offer a $300 gift card)
Samsung Galaxy S10, S10+, Note 10 - $300 direct savings (this will be the top direct savings deal but Costco will offer a $420 gift card) 
Apple Watch Series 5 (GPS + Cell) - $749.00 (save $50) - matching the live B&H’s deal
Apple Watch Series 4 (GPS + Cellular) - $429 (save $100) - matching Walmart’s current live deal 
Microsoft Xbox One X Bundle with $40 Best Buy Gift Card - $299.99 (save $150)
Sony PlayStation 4 Pro Bundle - $269.99 (save $130)
Nintendo Switch Bundle (game or free memory card) - $239 (save circa $110)
65-inch 4K TV - $600 from a premium brand (circa $800 discount)
Circa 42-inch 1080p TV - sub $140 from a cheap brand



Best Buy Black Friday deals for the Apple iPhone 11 series will be some of the best aroundApple


Samsung Black Friday 2019: Here Are The First DealsForbes Gordon Kelly

Yes, Best Buy’s doorbusters will tie-in closely with those of rivals - most noticeably Walmart. But Best Buy’s biggest differentiator will be its focus on direct savings rather than gift cards, while Best Buy credit card holders could earn a further 5% off deals, something that will match Target’s additional Cyber Monday discounts for REDCard holders. 
If you can’t want for Black Friday itself and want a deal now, check out my dedicated store-by-store, other Black Friday deals guides for Amazon’s early live deals, Walmart’s live deals and my roundups of the best live Apple deals and Samsung savings.
