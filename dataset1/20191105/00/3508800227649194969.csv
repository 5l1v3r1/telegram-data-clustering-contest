中國房市泡沫爆破在即，政府卻出手也不對，不出手也不對
05 Nov 2019, 00:14 by 馬振洲


我們想讓你知道的是在中國房地產大舉開發的背後，其實充滿了開發不下去的爛尾樓和賣不掉的商品房，但當中共中央出手「調控」之時，卻又面對不能漲、不能跌、不能不救的矛盾窘境。



根據中國人民法院網的公告中顯示，2019年截至10月27日，已有408家中國的房地產公司宣告破產，平均每天1.3家，照此進度推算，2019年全年破產的家數將有可能超越2018年的458家，兩年將有近千家房地產公司破產。
根據中國國家統計局的調查，2018年全中國房地產公司的數量為97938家，許多中國的產業分析師稱：「破產的數量不到百分之一，屬於正常的行業淘汰率」，但需知道，這9萬多家房地產公司登記中，有很大一部分的比例是所謂的「項目分公司」，有些項目分公司員工人數不過僅有十幾位銷售或行政，實際上具有開發、經營或融資能力的遠不及這個數量；再扣除上千家「風吹不動，雷打不倒」的國營企業，「實際」的破產比例其實更高，中國民營的房地產公司日子其實並不好過。
開發不下去的爛尾樓、賣不掉的商品房
隨著中國政府監管的加碼，2019年是房地產企業融資最為困難的一年。不但銀行貸款收緊，融資成本也不斷提高，2019年前三季度，房地產債券類融資成本為6.88%，較2018年全年上升了0.67個百分點。首當其衝的，當屬那些開發投入超過自身的融資能力，蓋不下去，轉手又賣不掉的中小型開發商，導致市場上充斥著無數的「鬼城」和「爛尾樓」。
那些好不容易撐過開發期的項目，也面臨銷售困難、資金回款速度緩慢的窘境。
網上傳出，中國知名房地產公司恆大集團，多處的商品房已經打到七折仍賣不掉，再要申請降價卻遭中國政府駁回的案例。項目要維護、員工薪水要發，但融資困難的情況下，想要「借新債還舊債」的路走不通，因而衍伸出另一種亂象出現。例如中國知名房地產公司綠地集團，近期就被內部員工截圖對話記錄爆料，其位於湖南某處的建案，要求每位員工必須在12天內買下至少一套公寓，頭期款需繳交20%，半年內需付清50%，未完成者將被公司直接開除。需知道，綠地集團是在2019年《財富》中國500強企業排名第23位的大型企業，比阿里巴巴（第24名）和騰訊（第27名）的排名還高。
面臨中國房市泡沫瀕臨爆破的危機下，多年來一直主導中國房市調控的中央政府，除了留下「房子是用來住的，不是用來炒的」這句空泛的口號外，確實沒有什麼具體建樹。究其原因，還是一方面要抑制一線城市房價過高、民怨四起的情況，另一方面又戒不掉依靠房地產拉動二三線城市經濟增長的惡習。

長期處在這種左右為難又自相矛盾的局面下，中央政府在2019年宣佈「一城一策」的新政策指導方向：簡單來說就是把房市調控的球丟給地方政府自行決定，中央政府則退到幕後只看成效。也因此，2019年前9個月以來，各地方政府合計進行了415次房地產調控，平均每個工作日有2次以上的房地產調控，刷新了歷史紀錄，但這些「調」與「控」具體的內容是什麼？又是否能見到成效？筆者簡要說明這些調控的大致內容並凸顯其中相互矛盾之處。
不能漲、不能跌、不能救
舉大連市政府在2019年7月份發佈的《關於加強房地產市場調控工作的通知》中指出，建商所申請的預售屋最終實際售出的價格不得高於原本的申報價格，且即使降價，也不得超過5%，強行干預市場機制。當然，此舉也直接衝擊了大連市新屋銷售的市場，原因還是在於避免房價一路走高，吸乾了民眾的資產，導致錢流不進其他民生行業，無法刺激帶動經濟。
另一個例子則是江西省贛縣，在2019年3月發佈的緊急命令，要求開發商立即停止所有特價房銷售，所有特價房價格皆要上報住建局審批，形同宣佈房價「不能跌」，並要求建商制定因降價引發的應急措施，避免民眾因資產縮水所導致的社會動盪以及銀行產生呆帳與壞帳的風險。
中國知名房地產公司融創集團董事長孫宏斌就在2019年年中股東會上用「史無前例」來形容當下中國房地產融資困難的情況。從先前提到的諸多案例也說明，中國政府因為害怕房市的泡沫越吹越大，已不能讓資金繼續流入房市，增加壞帳風險。2019年8月，中國政府發部《關於開展2019年銀行機構房地產業務專項檢查的通知》中表示，將在32個城市針對銀行於房地產業務專項檢查，嚴厲查處各種將資金通過挪用、轉道等方式流入房地產行業的違法違規行為。

不能不救
矛盾之處卻又在於，一旦融資快速收縮，所帶來的衝擊則會導致多家中小房企資金鏈斷裂，企業破產倒閉，大量員工失業的情況，經濟情勢瞬間遭受打擊，導致中國證監會又偷開後門，允許包括：永隆股權投資、惠理股權投資、世邦魏理仕……等多家房地產私募「洋基金」登陸救火，把這些金融風險轉嫁到外資手中。
在這些政策搖擺不定，又前後不連貫的態勢中，可想而知將有更多悲劇或鬧劇持續上演，中國政府除了將這些問題不斷的「拖」、「拋」以外，終有一天，自己所種下的因和未來所有的果，恐怕還是要由自己來承擔。

China’s housing bubble bursts soon, but the government’s shots are not right.
05 Nov 2019, 00:14 by Ma Zhenzhou


What we want you to know is that behind the massive development of real estate in China, it is actually full of unfinished buildings and commercial houses that cannot be developed. However, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ""controls"", it faces the inability to rise. A contradiction that cannot fall and cannot be saved.



According to the announcement of the People's Court Network of China, as of October 27, 20,000 Chinese real estate companies have declared bankruptcy, with an average of 1.3 per day. According to this progress, the number of bankruptcies in the whole year of 2019 will be possible. Beyond the 458 in 2018, nearly a thousand real estate companies will go bankrupt in two years.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the number of real estate companies in China in 2018 was 97,738. Many Chinese industry analysts said: ""The number of bankruptcies is less than 1%, which is a normal industry elimination rate."" Among the more than 90,000 real estate companies registered, a large proportion of them are so-called “project branches”. Some of the project branches have only a dozen or so sales or administrative staff, and actually have development, operation or financing. The capacity is far less than this amount; after deducting thousands of state-owned enterprises that ""the wind can't move, the thunder does not fall"", the ""actual"" bankruptcy ratio is actually higher, and the days of Chinese private real estate companies are actually not good.
Undeveloped unfinished buildings and unsold commercial houses
With the over-regulation of the Chinese government, 2019 is the most difficult year for real estate companies to raise funds. Not only did bank loans tighten, but financing costs also increased. In the first three quarters of 2019, the cost of real estate bond financing was 6.88%, an increase of 0.67 percentage points over the full year of 2018. First and foremost, the small and medium-sized developers who have invested more than their own financing ability, can't cover it, can't sell it, and the market is full of countless ""ghost towns"" and ""unfinished buildings"".
Those projects that have been able to survive the development period are also facing the dilemma of sales difficulties and slow capital withdrawals.
The network uploaded, the well-known Chinese real estate company Evergrande Group, many commercial housing has been hit by 30%, still can not sell, and then apply for price cuts but the case rejected by the Chinese government. The project needs to be maintained, and the salary of the employees must be issued. However, in the case of difficulties in financing, the road to ""borrowing new debts and paying old debts"" will not work, and thus another kind of chaos will emerge. For example, China's well-known real estate company Greenland Group has recently been screened by internal employees' screenshots. It is located in a certain place in Hunan, requiring each employee to buy at least one apartment within 12 days. The first payment must be paid 20 %, 50% will be paid within half a year, and those who are not completed will be expelled directly by the company. It is important to know that Greenland Group is the 23rd largest company in Fortune China's top 500 companies in 2019, ranking higher than Alibaba (24th) and Tencent (27th).
In the face of the crisis of China's housing bubble on the verge of blasting, the central government that has dominated the regulation of China's housing market for many years, apart from leaving the empty slogan ""The house is used for living, not for speculation,"" there is really no concrete achievement. . The reason for this is that on the one hand, it is necessary to curb the situation that housing prices in the first-tier cities are too high and people are resentful. On the other hand, they cannot stop the habit of relying on real estate to drive economic growth in second- and third-tier cities.

In the long-term situation of this dilemma and contradiction, the central government announced the new policy guiding direction of ""one city, one policy"" in 2019: simply speaking, it is the decision of the local government to throw the ball to the local government. The government has retreated to the background and only sees the results. Therefore, since the first nine months of 2019, local governments have carried out a total of 415 real estate regulation and control, and on average, more than two real estate controls per working day have set a new record, but these ""tune"" and ""control"" specific What is the content? Can you see the results? The author briefly explains the general content of these regulation and highlights the contradictions.
Can't rise, can't fall, can't save
In the ""Notice on Strengthening the Regulation of the Real Estate Market"" issued by the Dalian Municipal Government in July 2019, it is pointed out that the final sale price of the pre-sale house applied for by the China Construction Institute shall not be higher than the original declared price, and even if the price is reduced, Nor can it exceed 5% and force intervention in market mechanisms. Of course, this move also directly impacted the market for new home sales in Dalian. The reason is to avoid rising house prices and sucking up the assets of the people, resulting in money flowing into other people's livelihood industries and unable to stimulate the economy.
Another example is the emergency order issued by Jixian County in Jiangxi Province in March 2019, requiring developers to immediately stop all special-purpose housing sales. All special room prices must be reported to the URA for approval, and the price can not be lowered. And ask the builders to formulate emergency measures caused by price cuts to avoid the social turmoil caused by the shrinking of assets and the risk of bad debts and bad debts.
Sun Hongbin, the chairman of China's well-known real estate company Sunac Group, used ""unprecedented"" at the mid-year shareholders' meeting in 2019 to describe the current difficulties in real estate financing in China. From the many cases mentioned earlier, the Chinese government has been unable to allow funds to continue to flow into the housing market and increase the risk of bad debts because of the fear that the bubble in the housing market will blow up. In August 2019, the Chinese Government’s “Notice on Launching a Special Inspection of Banking Real Estate Business in 2019” stated that it would conduct special inspections on real estate business in 32 cities, and severely investigate and punish various funds for misappropriation, transfer, etc. The way to flow into the real estate industry violations.

Can't help
The contradiction lies in the fact that once the financing shrinks rapidly, the impact will lead to the break of the capital chain of many small and medium-sized housing enterprises, the bankruptcy of enterprises, the unemployment of a large number of employees, and the economic situation will be hit in an instant, resulting in the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Stealing the back door, including: Yonglong Equity Investment, Huili Equity Investment, CB Richard Ellis, etc. A number of real estate private equity ""foreign funds"" landed in the fire, transferring these financial risks to foreign investors.
In the vacillating and inconsistent of these policies, it is conceivable that more tragedies or farce will continue to be staged. The Chinese government will continue to ""drag"" and ""throw"" these issues one after another. I will probably bear the cause of the planting and all the fruits of the future.
