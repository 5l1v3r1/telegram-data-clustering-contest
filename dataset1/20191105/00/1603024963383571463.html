        <b>Sharekhan's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/trading/ptcindia/PTC02">PTC India</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Standalone EBITDA rose by 7.1% y-o-y to Rs. 141 crore and was above our estimate led by higher surcharge income and lower opex. Trading volumes declined by 1.5% y-o-y while gross margins increased by 12.1% y-o-y to 7.43 paisa per unit. Company signed a contract for the Mangdechhu Hydro Electric Project in Bhutan with a potential of 3 billion units annually; draft regulations for power trading propose to cap margin at Re. 1 paisa/unit for back-to-back contracts. Weak financials of PTC India Financial Services could delay/impact management’s efforts to unlock value.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We maintain our Hold rating on PTC India with an unchanged PT of Rs. 65.</p>
