Regional wireless carrier U.S. Cellular (NYSE: USM), saw its stock decline by about 15% in Friday’s (1st November) trading after it posted weaker than expected Q3 earnings, although revenues beat expectations. The company lost 19k postpaid subscribers over the quarter, compared to 1k losses in the year-ago quarter, partly due to the defection of connected device users and feature phone users. Separately, the company also indicated that the uncertainty surrounding the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint – the third and fourth-largest U.S. carriers, was resulting in some difficulties in its planning and securing new partnerships. Below, we take a look at how the company has fared over the last few years and the potential outlook over the next year.View our interactive dashboard analysis on Why Did U.S. Cellular Stock Tank 15% On Friday
