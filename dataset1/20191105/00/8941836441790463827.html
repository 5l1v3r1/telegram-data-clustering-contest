      <h1>Former ambassador says she was warned to ‘watch my back’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">MARY CLARE JALONICK and LISA MASCARO and NANCY BENAC</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - It started with a warning to watch her back, that people were “looking to hurt” her. From there, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Marie Yovanovitch</a> told House investigators, it escalated into a chilling campaign to fire her as President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and his allies angled in Eastern Europe for political advantage at home.</p>
      <p>Testimony from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>, released Monday, offered a first word-for-word look at the closed-door House impeachment hearings. Inside, Democrats and Republicans are waging a pitched battle over what to make of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s efforts to get <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s leaders to investigate political rival Joe Biden, Biden’s son and Democratic activities in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>The transcript came out on the same day that four <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> administration officials defied subpoenas to testify, acting on orders from a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> that is fighting the impeachment investigation with all its might. Among those refusing to testify: John Eisenberg, the lead lawyer at the National Security Council and, by some accounts, the man who ordered a rough transcript of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s phone call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s leader moved to a highly restricted computer system.</p>
      <p>During nine hours of sometimes emotional testimony, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> detailed efforts led by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Rudy Giuliani</a> and other <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> allies to push her out of her post. The career diplomat, who was recalled from her job in May on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s orders, testified that a senior Ukrainian official told her that “I really needed to watch my back.”</p>
      <p>While the major thrust of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s testimony was revealed in her opening statement, Monday’s 317-page transcript provided new details.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> offered significant threads of information including the possibility that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> was directly involved in a phone call with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a>, the president’s personal lawyer, and the Ukrainians dating back to January 2018. And she pushed back on Republican suggestions that she harbored opposition to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>She had been recalled from Kyiv before the July 25 phone call between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> and Ukrainian President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/volodymyr-zelenskiy/">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> that’s at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Later, she was “surprised and dismayed” by what she saw in the transcript of the call - including that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> had called her “bad news.” He also said that “she’s going to go through some things.”</p>
      <p>“I was shocked,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> said, to see “that the president would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart.”</p>
      <p>Asked about her as he left on a campaign trip Monday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> had a more equivocal comment: “I’m sure she’s a very fine woman. I just don’t know much about her.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said transcripts from the hearings are being released so “the American public will begin to see for themselves.” Two were released Monday, and more are coming.</p>
        <p>Republicans have accused Democrats of conducting a one-sided process behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>But the transcripts show GOP lawmakers were given time for questioning, which they used to poke at different aspects of the impeachment inquiry. Some Republicans criticized the process as unfair, while others tried to redirect witnesses to their own questions about Biden’s work on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> corruption issues while he was vice president.</p>
        <p>In public, some Republicans say the president’s actions toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, though not ideal, are certainly not impeachable.</p>
        <p>Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight committee, defended <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s ouster as clearly within the president’s prerogative.</p>
        <p>“President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> has the authority to name who he wants in any ambassador position. That’s a call solely for the president of the United States as the commander in chief,” Jordan said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> was recalled from Kyiv as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a> pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with Burisma, a gas company there.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a>’s role in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> was central to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>’s testimony. She said she was aware of an interest by the Trump lawyer and his associates in investigating Biden and Burisma “with a view to finding things that could be possibly damaging to a presidential run,” as well as investigating the 2016 election and theories that it was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, and not Russia, that interfered.</p>
        <p>However, asked directly if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a> was promoting investigations on Burisma and Biden, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> said, “It wasn’t entirely clear to me what was going on.”</p>
        <p>More directly, she drew a link between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a> and two businessmen — Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have been indicted in the U.S. on charges stemming from campaign donations — as part of the campaign to oust her. She understood they were looking to expand their business interests in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> “and that they needed a better ambassador to sort of facilitate their business’ efforts here.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> said was told by Ukrainian officials last November or December that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a> was in touch with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>’s former top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, “and that they had plans, and that they were going to, you know, do things, including to me.”</p>
        <p>She said she was told Lutsenko “was looking to hurt me in the U.S.”</p>
        <p>The diplomat said she sought advice from Gordon Sondland, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s ambassador to the European Union, after an article appeared in The Hill newspaper about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a>’s complaints against her. Sondland told her, “‘You need to go big or go home,” advising her to “tweet out there that you support the president.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> said she felt she could not follow that advice as a nonpartisan government official.</p>
        <p>The former envoy stressed to investigators that she was not disloyal to the president. She answered “no” when asked point blank if she’d ever “badmouthed” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a>, and said she felt U.S. policy in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ukraine/">Ukraine</a> “actually got stronger” because of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s decision to provide lethal assistance to the country - military aid that later was held up by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> as it pushed for investigations into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s political foes.</p>
        <p>Long hours into her testimony, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> was asked why she was such “a thorn in their side” that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rudy-giuliani/">Giuliani</a> and others wanted her fired.</p>
        <p>“Honestly,” she said, “it’s a mystery to me.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a>, still employed by the State Department, is in a fellowship at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>She told the investigators that the campaign against her, which included an article that was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., undermined her ability to serve as a credible ambassador and she wanted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement defending her. But no statement was issued.</p>
        <p>The impeachment panels also released testimony Monday from Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Pompeo.</p>
        <p>McKinley, a 37-year career diplomat, testified that he decided to resign from his post as a senior adviser to Pompeo after his repeated efforts to get the State Department to issue a statement of support for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> after the transcript of the Trump-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/volodymyr-zelenskiy/">Zelenskiy</a> phone call was released. “To see the impugning of somebody I know to be a serious, committed colleague in the manner that it was done raised alarm bells for me,” he said.</p>
        <p>McKinley said he was already concerned about politicization at the State Department, and that the refusal to publicly back <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marie-yovanovitch/">Yovanovitch</a> convinced him it was time to leave.</p>
