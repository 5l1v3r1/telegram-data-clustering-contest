      <h1>Alec Baldwin sues man who accused him of parking spot rage</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Alec Baldwin</a> filed a defamation lawsuit Friday against the man who says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> hit him in the face during an argument over a New York City parking space.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> wrote in his lawsuit that contractor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Wojciech Cieszkowski</a>’s claim that he was violently assaulted by the actor is “objectively false.”</p>
      <p>“When two New Yorkers get into an argument over a parking space, typically what happens is they exchange a few sharp words and then move on with their lives,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> wrote in the suit filed in Manhattan state Supreme Court. “But that is not what happened here.”</p>
      <p>The lawsuit says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a> made up a false story about the skirmish in an effort to extort money from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a>. “Hospital records and video surveillance footage prove that it was a lie,” the complaint says. “But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a> told it to the police and medical professionals anyway.”</p>
      <p>Police arrested <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> after the Nov. 2, 2018, scuffle over a parking spot in front of Baldwin’s Manhattan apartment building. The actor pleaded guilty to harassment in January and agreed to take an anger-management class.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a> sued <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> claiming that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a>’s assault was “physically painful and psychologically traumatic.”</p>
      <p>The Pearl River, New York resident referenced <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a>’s recurring “Saturday Night Live” role as President Donald Trump in his lawsuit filed in March and amended May 17. “When you’re a star, they let you do it - hit ‘em right in the face,” the lawsuit said. “Like the man he plays on television, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Alec Baldwin</a> is an entitled celebrity with a long history of verbally and physically mistreating others he sees as beneath him.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a> wrote in the lawsuit that he “lightly pushed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a> in the chest with one hand” but did not seriously injure him.</p>
      <p>“In fact, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a>’s supposed ‘injuries’ were so minor, or nonexistent, that his discharge instructions were to take a single dose of Tylenol,” the former “30 Rock” star wrote.</p>

        <p>Douglas Lieb, a lawyer for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Cieszkowski</a>, called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Baldwin</a>’s lawsuit “a desperate tactic designed to silence <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Mr. Cieszkowski</a>.”</p>
        <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Mr. Cieszkowski</a> won’t be deterred from holding <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alec-baldwin/">Mr. Baldwin</a> accountable for his bullying,” Lieb said Tuesday. “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wojciech-cieszkowski/">Mr. Cieszkowski</a> looks forward to his day in court before a jury of ordinary people like him.”</p>
