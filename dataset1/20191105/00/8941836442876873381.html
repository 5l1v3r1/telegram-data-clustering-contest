      <p>The extension was announced Tuesday and is pending approval from the Board of Regents. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pj-fleck/">Fleck</a> calls it “a tremendous honor to lead this team,” and said the Gophers are building “a championship culture.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pj-fleck/">Fleck</a> is in his third year at Minnesota, which is off to an 8-0 start (5-0 Big Ten).</p>
