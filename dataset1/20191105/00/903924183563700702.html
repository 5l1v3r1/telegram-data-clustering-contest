      <h1>Keir Starmer looks stumped in this Tory video – but the original clip is very different</h1>
      <h2>The party seems to have misleadingly edited an interview with the shadow Brexit secretary for an attack ad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/writers/328394" target="_blank">Election Mole</a></address>
      <p>The BBC’s Daniel Sandford <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCDanielS/status/1191732381306277890?s=20">has noticed something odd</a> about a Tory attack ad published on its Twitter account earlier today.</p>
      <p>It was basically a replay of an interview with the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on <i>Good Morning Britain</i> this morning.</p>
      <p>Here it is:</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Conservatives/status/1191686313461846016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>A bit dull, but it makes the intended point – that Labour’s Brexit stance is confusing and nonsensical, so much so that even Starmer is struck dumb by it at the end of the interview.</p>
      <p>But actually, as Sandford discovered when watching the original interview, Starmer wasn’t stumped by Piers Morgan’s question at the end of the Conservatives’ video at all.</p>
      <p>In fact, he answered the question at length:</p>
      <blockquote>“Well, Piers, I have been talking to the EU, to political leaders across the EU27 countries for three years, and I know very well what the parameters are of any deal that they would do with a Labour government, we actually explored some of it in the cross-party talks that we were in with the government six months or so ago, so I know that a customs union and single market alignment and protection of workers’ rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated.”</blockquote>
      <p>It looks like the Tory video has used a clip of Starmer silently listening to one of the presenters’ questions to suggest he was stumped into silence by Morgan asking why the EU would give him a good deal.</p>
      <p>Here’s the clip:</p>

      <p>Morgan himself has weighed in, calling the edit “misleading” and “unfair”:</p>

      <p>Your mole has asked CCHQ what the story is behind the change in the footage, and awaits their reply.</p>
