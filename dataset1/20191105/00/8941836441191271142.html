      <p>JAL, N.M. (AP) - A small New Mexico town in the heart of the Permian Basin oil and gas boom is getting a new camp development to house oil workers.</p>
      <p>The Hobbs News-Sun reports Canada-based international hospitality company Amity Lodges announced this month a groundbreaking ceremony for a new camp development under construction east of Jal, New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Jal Mayor Steve Aldridge says the southeastern New Mexico town has been struggling in recent years to provide sufficient housing for oil and gas workers.</p>
      <p>Amity Lodges management consultant Ryan Bullock says the camp will open in a first phase providing 558 executive style beds.</p>
      <p>Officials say amenities at the facility will include a 26,424 square-foot (2,455 square-meter) kitchen and dining hall in 39 modules with up to 780 dining hall seats.</p>
