      <p>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) - A Georgia county school board is set to vote on whether to use eminent domain to acquire nearby property to house its softball field and tennis court.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta Constitution-Journal reports the Cobb County School Board will vote Nov. 14. District spokeswoman Nan Kiel said the 15-acre site would be used to give all Walton High students access to high-quality athletic fields. The newspaper says the move may be used to satisfy concerns that the school is violating Title IX laws by keeping its softball team’s field off campus.</p>
      <p>The school’s rebuild that started in 2015 swallowed the land then used for tennis and softball. Both teams have since held practices and home games at a public park. The board has already offered about $3 million for the land.</p>
