Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain last week had said the national capital had recorded the lowest number of cases of dengue this year, in comparison to the last five years, and appealed to Delhiites to keep up the collective efforts till the next month.
""Latest figures show that till October 26 there have been 833 cases of dengue in Delhi this year so far, and there has been no casualty. This is the lowest figure for Delhi in the last five years,"" he said.
The minister said Delhi is ""well on course to defeat dengue this year"" and appealed to people to keep working on preventive measures and build more awareness.
According to the report, at least 143 cases of chikungunya have also been reported this year.
Last year, 2,798 dengue cases and four deaths were recorded by the SDMC. It had also reported 473 cases of malaria and 165 cases of chikungunya.
Both the Delhi government and the local bodies have been making efforts to raise awareness on precautions to ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae.
The AAP government has started an anti-dengue campaign '10Hafte, 10Baje, 10Minute' urging people to inspect their house for any standing water.
The campaign -- from September 1 and November 15 -- to combat dengue has garnered support from several personalities, including cricket legend Kapil Dev, many Bollywood actors and well-known journalists.
Dengue mosquito larvae breed in clear, standing water, while those of malaria thrive even in dirty water.
Doctors have advised people to take precautions and ensure that there is no breeding of mosquito larvae around them. They have urged people to wear full-sleeves and use mosquito nets.
Water coolers should be dried up when not in use as mosquitoes carrying dengue virus usually breed there, a doctor said.
Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between July and November, but the period may stretch till mid-December.
Meanwhile, mosquito-breeding has been reported in at least 1,69,021 households and 1,34,328 legal notices have been issued this year.
From public schools to government office premises, several institutions have been penalised by civic authorities in north Delhi in the last five months over breeding of mosquito larvae on their premises, officials had earlier said.Special Thursday Expiry on 10th 7th NovEarly Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
