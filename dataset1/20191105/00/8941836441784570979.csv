School board may use eminent domain to get sports fields

05 Nov 2019

MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) - A Georgia county school board is set to vote on whether to use eminent domain to acquire nearby property to house its softball field and tennis court.
The Atlanta Constitution-Journal reports the Cobb County School Board will vote Nov. 14. District spokeswoman Nan Kiel said the 15-acre site would be used to give all Walton High students access to high-quality athletic fields. The newspaper says the move may be used to satisfy concerns that the school is violating Title IX laws by keeping its softball team’s field off campus.
The school’s rebuild that started in 2015 swallowed the land then used for tennis and softball. Both teams have since held practices and home games at a public park. The board has already offered about $3 million for the land.
