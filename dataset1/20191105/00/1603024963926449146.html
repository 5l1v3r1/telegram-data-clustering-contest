      <p>Samsung has reportedly started working on the Galaxy A51. The smartphone is rumoured to launch sometime next year. A new report has revealed some key specifications of the Galaxy A51.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy A50s successor is said to get significant upgrades in the camera department.</p>
      <p>According to tipster Ishan Agarwal, who has collaborated with the website DroidShout, the Samsung Galaxy A51 will get a triple camera setup with a 48MP primary sensor. Agarwal has not mentioned details of the other two sensors. For selfies, the Galaxy A51 will reportedly get a 32MP front-facing camera.</p>

      <p>On the front, the Galaxy A51 will get a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a water-drop notch on top.  The phone will also come packed with a 4,000 mAh battery and will boot on Android 10 based One UI 2.0 out-of-the-box, according to the DroidShout <a href="https://www.droidshout.com/exclusive-galaxy-a51-to-feature-48mp-camera-4000mah-battery-and-more/">report</a>.</p>
      <p>Some specifications reported by Agarwal are contrary to previous reports. A recent <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a51-quad-camera-images-leak-exclusive">report</a> by 91Mobiles suggests that Galaxy A51 will have an L-shaped quad-camera setup. The report reiterates another report that stated the <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/leak-suggests-2020-samsung-galaxy-a-series-smartphones-would-feature-up-to-108mp-camera-sensor-4342231.html">Galaxy A51 will have a 32MP primary sensor</a> with a 12MP wide-angle lens, a 12MP 2x optical zoom lens and a 5MP depth sensor.</p>
      <p>Both the reports confirm that Galaxy A51 will feature a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/geekbench-listing-of-samsung-galaxy-a51-reveal-specifications-before-launch-4562681.html">Galaxy A51 with the model number SM-A515F</a> allegedly made a visit to Geekbench listings that revealed the processor details. </p>
      <p>Galaxy A51 would get powered by Samsung’s in-house Exynos 9611 Octa-core SoC clocked at 1.74GHz. The same processor is found on the recently-launched Galaxy A50s and Galaxy M30s. The SoC managed to get a single-core score of 323 and a multi-core score of 1185. </p>
      <p>The listing suggests that Galaxy A51 will be available in a 4GB RAM variant. Samsung is likely to launch more storage variants as well.</p>
      <p>The South Korean tech giant has reportedly started the <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/samsung-has-begun-the-production-of-galaxy-a51-in-india-report-4593651.html">production of Galaxy A51 in India</a>.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
