      <h1>Revenge Of The Steel Maker; China’s Internal Tariff War Turns Nasty</h1>

      <p>The plot thickens in the battle for control of the world’s nickel supply with a leading Chinese steel maker accused of squeezing the market in revenge for rivals encouraging the government to whack it with punishing tariffs.Tsingshan has annoyed other Chinese steel mills by developing a better way to make stainless steel, the major use for nickel, which is also developing an important market in the batteries used by electric vehicles.</p>

      <p>The Tsingshan process led to the building of a world-class stainless steel mill on the Indonesia island of Sulawesi using locally-mined nickel with some of the end product being exported to China.</p>
      <p>
        <b>China Attacks China</b>
      </p>
      <p>Other steel makers have complained, as has been explored here in earlier stories (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2019/08/20/china-attacks-china-a-tale-of-collateral-damage-in-the-trade-war/#1e80b46a2478">China Attacks China; A Tale Of Collateral Damage In The Trade War</a>, August 20), and most recently (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2019/10/20/nickel-relives-the-failed-attempt-by-the-hunt-brothers-to-corner-silver/#6b6126e81406">Nickel Relives The Failed Attempt By The Hunt Brothers To Corner Silver</a>, October 20).</p>
      <p>But the latest twist in a battle between warring steel mills is an accusation from a leading investment bank that Tsingshan is not so much trying to corner the nickel market as drive its rivals out of business.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse said a sharp fall in the stockpile of nickel held in the warehouses of the London Metal Exchange (LME) was being seen as an indication of a worldwide shortage of the metal–but that might not be the case despite concern that an Indonesian ban on the export of unprocessed nickel ore could trigger a sharp price increase.</p>
      <p>Much of the metal removed from the LME might have gone into private storage, the bank said, helping create an impression of a tight market which could force the price up.</p>
      <p>What caught the eye of Credit Suisse analysts was a deal in mid-October which saw 78,000 tons of nickel valued at around $1.3 billion acquired by a single buyer, leaving official LME stocks at a 10-year low.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Finger Pointing</b>
      </p>
      <p>“This has all the hallmarks of a massive buyer taking possession, and Reuters (a news service) has pointed at major Chinese stainless steel producer Tsingshan as the buyer,” Credit Suisse said.</p>
      <p>“Tsingshan has also been fingered as the party behind a smaller drawdown in July that initiated the upward move in the nickel price before indonesia’s export ban took over as the price driver.”</p>
      <p>Knowing what game Tsingshan is playing has become a major talking point in metal markets.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse said there are two possibilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>That Tsingshan may consider it needs additional nickel to support stainless steel production in China following the Indonesian export ban, or</li>
        <li>Tsingshan may want to tighten the nickel market, to drive the price up and put financial pressure on stainless steel producers that are reliant on third party nickel supply.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some Chinese stainless steel makers are reported to already be losing money because of high iron ore and nickel prices.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan is not one of the loss makers but it almost certainly knows which of its rivals is under financial pressure.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tsingshan’s Revenge</b>
      </p>
      <p>“These loss-making companies probably include some of those that lobbied governments to block Tsingshan’s stainless imports (from Indonesia),” Credit Suisse said.</p>
      <p>“It is in Tsingshan’s interests to make production more expensive for others, and drive some Chinese companies out of business, and potentially crack open protected markets for its low-cost stainless sheets from Indonesia even in the face of tariffs.”</p>
      <p>Both options, securing its own future supplies of nickel and forcing rivals to the wall, are plausible, Credit Suisse said, adding that: “they are not mutually exclusive.”</p>
