      <h1>Elon Musk: Noisy Starship Spaceports Will Be 20 Miles Offshore</h1>

      <h3>Travel by Rocket</h3>
      <p>It’s been <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-spacexs-bfr-rocket-will-do-more-than-take-us-to-mars">more than two years</a> since SpaceX announced its plans for long distance travel onboard what it now calls its Starship. The promise: rocketing up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-big-falcon-rocket-like-disney-space-mountain-2019-6">1,000 people</a> anywhere on Earth, no matter how far, in under one hour — an experience <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-starship-disney-space-mountain">Musk likened</a> to Disney’s Space Mountain ride earlier this year.</p>
      <p>SpaceX has since made <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-final-starship-prototype-design">a ton of progress</a> on Starship. And in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1191496935250616321">Monday tweet</a>, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk dropped a new tidbit: Starship spaceports will “probably need to be [about] 20 miles offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights.”</p>
      <h3>Ten Years</h3>
      <p>COO Gwynne Shotwell confirmed that the company is still committed to its plans for a transportation system involving Starship in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dar8P3r7GYA">May 2018 TED Talk</a>.</p>
      <p>“This is definitely going to happen,” she said, adding that it would probably take roughly ten years.</p>
      <h3>Spaceport Shuttle</h3>
      <p>So how will passengers get from the city to these offshore spaceports? Musk suggested in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/996691566851801088">May 2018 tweet</a> that SpaceX will use underground shuttles.</p>
      <p>It’s a futuristic vision. But even with ten years, SpaceX has a lot of work to do. The company has yet to launch a fully-equipped Starship rocket, after all, let alone one with passengers on board.</p>
