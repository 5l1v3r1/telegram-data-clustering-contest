      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - Afghan President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashraf-ghani/">Ashraf Ghani</a> and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi have discussed a planned meeting in Beijing that would include Afghan figures and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> representatives.</p>
      <p>That meeting - known as “intra-Afghan dialogue” -was to take place last month but has been postponed. No new date has been set. The last time it was held was in July in Qatar.</p>
      <p>The dialogue is a separate process from the U.S.-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a> talks that collapsed in September.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s Afghan statement says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashraf-ghani/">Ghani</a> and Wang underscored the Afghan government and people’s role in the peace process.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ashraf-ghani/">Ghani</a> insists his government must lead any dialogue with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/taliban/">Taliban</a>, though the insurgents refuse to talk to government representatives. The future of his office is also uncertain as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> awaits the long overdue results of September presidential elections.</p>
