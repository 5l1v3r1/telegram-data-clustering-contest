      <p>CINCINNATI (AP) - A prosecutor says a man accused in the apparent overdose death of a jail inmate awaiting trial on charges of driving over a curb and killing a toddler in a stroller has been indicted in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters (DEE’ turz) says 27-year-old Kadeem Kelley was indicted Monday on involuntary manslaughter and drug charges in 31-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satwinder-singh/">Satwinder Singh</a>’s death at the county jail. Authorities say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satwinder-singh/">Singh</a> was found unresponsive in his cell in March and died.</p>
      <p>Deters says Kelley also was being held in the jail and worked as a porter, serving food to inmates. Authorities say he allegedly supplied drugs to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/satwinder-singh/">Singh</a>.</p>
      <p>Court records don’t show an attorney for Kelley.</p>
