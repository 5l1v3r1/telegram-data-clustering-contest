Skip Black Friday Lines With These Fashion Deals 2019
05 Nov 2019 by Forbes Finds
Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the biggest shopping holidays of the year, and they still draw in a huge percentage of the population. However, over the past few years, consumers have started their holiday shopping in the weeks leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in an effort to get an early start. To meet this demand, retailers are looking to breakthrough the tons of sales offered during these peak promotional days and, with consumers becoming increasingly sophisticated and fickle shoppers, they will take time to research the products they want to buy to find them at the most favorable price. In the modern consumer landscape, November 1 marks the true start to the holiday shopping season. This trend is even more apparent amongst higher-end brands, which, unlike their mass-market counterparts, tend to run their discount offers earlier in the season.
So, why wait for Black Friday discounts for a great deal? Here are three of this season’s hottest trends that are on sale now.

Dominatrix-Inspired “Denim”

From Alexander Wang and Dion Lee to Marni and Victoria Beckham, high-shine pieces have dominated runways recently. There are many ways to incorporate this textile into your wardrobe — such as a Matrix-inspired long-length leather coat or a sleek pencil skirt. However, you also can embrace a more toned-down version of this look to stay on-trend.
Jeans are a modern-day wardrobe staple but wearing them every day can get a little boring. To give an effortless lift to your seasonal wardrobe, try out these coated denim pieces for a subtle shine to elevate any outfit.
