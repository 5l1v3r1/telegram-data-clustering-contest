Only ‘fair’: Illinois adds runners to cross country meet

05 Nov 2019

PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Cross country runners who lost spots in this weekend’s Illinois state meet to athletes from Chicago will be at the starting line after all.
The Illinois High School Association says eight boys and five girls competing as individuals and the team from St. Viator in Arlington Heights will be in the state finals Saturday in Peoria.
They were bumped after the results of last week’s sectionals. Chicago runners got into the sectionals when a judge intervened, although they had missed regional races because of a teachers strike.

St. Viator says “we cherish the opportunity” to practice and prepare for the big race. The high school association says it’s a “fair gesture” to open the race to runners who lost qualifier sports to the Chicago runners.
