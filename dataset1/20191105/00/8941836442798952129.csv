Sheriff: Assault, robbery at restaurant a hoax

05 Nov 2019

SEATTLE (AP) - The King County Sheriff’s Office says a reported robbery and assault at a SeaTac restaurant was a hoax in an effort for the people involved to obtain visas that are available to some crime victims.
KING-TV reports SeaTac police originally released information that at least two men tied up customers at Bob’s Burgers n’ Teriyakis on Oct. 19, then demanded money from them and sexually assaulted two female customers.
King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht said Monday that the stories from those involved didn’t align.
The sheriff’s office is looking into possible criminal charges for false reporting. Johanknecht says she hasn’t seen this kind of situation in her career.

The son of the owner of Bob’s Burgers n’ Teriyakis spoke with KING 5 Monday evening and said he and his mother, who is the owner, are cooperating with the investigation.
