      <p>Art festivals in Georgia displaying handcrafted dolls draw artists from around the world.</p>
      <p>Each detail and article of clothing on these dolls is a work of art.</p>
      <p>Dolls by the celebrated German doll maker Sylvia Weser, for instance, can cost up to $10,000.</p>
      <p>The skeletons of her dolls are covered in leather and the face and arms are made of porcelain. It's hand-painted to get the features right.</p>
      <p>Some of the dolls are ornamented with semi-precious stones or crystals.</p>
      <p>"I was in love with my dolls and I never thought I would sell them. I made them just for me for my own collection and today I'm worldwide invited in Moscow, in New York, [and] Florida," Weser said.</p>
      <p>Art dolls presented at the exhibition vary in style, palette and technique, but this diversity makes the dolls unique.</p>
