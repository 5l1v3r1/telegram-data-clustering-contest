Even The Dictionary Is Dragging This Boomer Who Believes That “Boomer” Is A Slur
05 Nov 2019, 00:27 by Michelle Rennex
In what is probably the most boomer move in history, a 60-year-old man has said that the word “boomer” is the same as “the n-word”.
Yep. Bob Lonsberry, a radio host from New York, feels so personally attacked by the surge of “ok boomer” that he believes the word is as offensive as a racial slur.



In a tweet he later deleted, Bob said: “‘Boomer’ is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new.” Lol. Ok boomer.
His argument makes little sense because as a 60-year-old, a person born in 1959, Bob is a literal baby boomer. The dictionary defines a baby boomer as “a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the US between 1946 and 1965.”
Armed with this information and on a mission to school a boomer, Dictionary.com shut Bob down. Hard.



“Boomer is an informal noun referring to a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the US between 1946 and 1965,” Dictonary.com said. “The n-word is one of the most offensive words in the English language.”
This ultimate shut down at the hands of a DICTIONARY is probably why Boomer Bob deleted his tweet. But not before everyone online clowned him for it first.















Despite deleting his tweet, it looks like Bob has invited the very thing he was advocating against — boomer shaming. His other tweets on unrelated topics are now rightfully filled with “ok boomer” replies.



But honestly? None of Bob’s behaviour is at all surprising when you take a look at his twitter bio.



In conclusion, ok boomer.
