      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The NBA is introducing a direct-to-consumer subscription option for NBA TV, a move primarily targeted at those who don’t have cable or a package that already offers the channel.</p>

      <p>There will also be alternative streaming options for some games, including stat overlays on the game feed or alternative audio options.</p>
