Once again, we deeply apologize to the viewers and fans who loved 'Produce X 101', as well as to all of the 'Produce X 101' contestants, as well as the companies and their representatives."" 
Mnet continued, ""We plan to participate in the ongoing investigation process diligently, and also promise to take full responsibility where ever responsibility may be required. However, we ask that you all refrain from making speculative accusations regarding the artists who suffered damages through this incident.""
