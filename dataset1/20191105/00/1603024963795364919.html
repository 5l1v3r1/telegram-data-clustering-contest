        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We expect an improvement in margins in FY21 as pent up demand will have result in operating leverage. Reduction in corporate tax along with improved outlook on volumes leads us to raise our estimates and target price. Maintain BUY with a target of ₹2,975.</p>
