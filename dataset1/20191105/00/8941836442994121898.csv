Copa Libertadores final moved from Santiago to Lima

05 Nov 2019

ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) - South America’s soccer body CONMEBOL has moved the Copa Libertadores final from Santiago to Lima because of a weekslong wave of demonstrations in the Chilean capital.
CONMEBOL announced the decision on Tuesday after a meeting with representatives of the two finalists - defending champion River Plate of Argentina and Brazil’s Flamengo.
The one-leg final remains scheduled for Nov. 23, but now in Peru’s capital instead of Santiago’s Estadio Nacional stadium.
Chile has been in political turmoil for almost 20 days since demonstrations began last month after the government announced a hike in subway fares. The protests have expanded to include demands over education, health services and economic inequality.
Last year, the deciding Copa Libertadores game between River and archrivals Boca Juniors had to be moved to Madrid because of violent incidents in Buenos Aires. River won 3-1 at Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu stadium.
