      <p>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - Authorities are investigating the suicide of a jail inmate in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aspen/">Aspen</a> awaiting mental health treatment.</p>
      <p>The Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office says 64-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jillian-white/">Jillian White</a> was found unconscious and unresponsive in her cell Sunday and deputies weren’t able to revive her. Sheriff Joe DiSalvo told The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aspen/">Aspen</a> Times that she was last checked on between 15 and 30 minutes before.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jillian-white/">White</a> had a history of theft and drunken driving allegations. She was arrested in August for allegedly stealing from neighbors and was recently found incompetent to stand trial.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say that her lawyer told the court Friday that she had found a private mental health facility for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jillian-white/">White</a> to be sent to instead of the state hospital and requested that she be transferred there.</p>
