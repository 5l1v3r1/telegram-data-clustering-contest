侍ジャパンが辛勝発進！八回に一挙６点で逆転　稲葉監督は坂本に代打山田の執念采配

05 Nov 2019

　「プレミア１２・１次ラウンド、日本８－４ベネズエラ」（５日、桃園国際野球場）
　侍ジャパンが１次ラウンド初戦で辛勝発進。執念の逆転勝ちを飾った。
　負けられない戦いで、稲葉監督が苦渋の決断を下した。２点を追う八回、１死満塁。不振に苦しむ１番・坂本（巨人）に代打・山田（ヤクルト）を起用。山田は際どいボール球を見極め、押し出し四球を選んだ。
　押せ押せムードが生まれ、２番菊池（広島）が同点の左前適時打。３番近藤（日本ハム）も押し出し四球を選び、再逆転に成功した。さらに４番鈴木（広島）の左犠飛などで、この回一挙６点を奪った。
　苦しい展開だった。先発山口（巨人）が四回に先制点を献上。五回に菊池、鈴木の適時打で逆転したが、直後の六回に暗転した。２番手の山岡（オリックス）が３連打で同点とされ、さらに１死二、三塁。大竹（巨人）－中川（巨人）とつないだが、二ゴロの間に勝ち越しを許し、さらに適時内野安打で２－４とされた。
　打線は小刻みにつなぐベネズエラの継投に苦戦。手元で変化させる外国人特有のボールに芯を外され、凡打の山を築いた。特に今大会で主軸と期待される坂本は、カナダとの強化試合から３戦１２打席ノーヒット。八回は相手投手の乱調にも助けられて大量得点となったが、トータルでは相手の１０本を下回る８安打。秋山（西武）の離脱で不在となった１番打者の起用が、今後のカギとなりそうだ。
　日本は６日にプエルトリコ、７日に台湾と対戦。３試合の成績で上位２チームが２次ラウンドに進出する。

SAMURAI JAPAN is going to start off! Reversed by 6 points at a time in eight times. Director Inaba is devoted to Sakamoto.

05 Nov 2019

""Premier 12.1st round, Japan 8-4 Venezuela"" (5th, Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium)
侍 Samurai Japan started off in the first round of the first round. A reversal of tenacity was displayed.
Director Inaba made a difficult decision in an unbeatable battle. Eight times chasing two points, one death. Yakult Yamada is appointed as the substitute for No. 1 Sakamoto (giant) who suffers from slump. Yamada identified a terrible ball and chose an extruded ball.
Ose-Kuse-mood was born, and No. 2 Kikuchi (Hiroshima) hit the same time before the left. No. 3 Kondo (Nippon Ham) also chose to push the ball and succeeded in reversing. In addition, he lost 6 points at once, such as in the left sacrificial flight of No. 4 Suzuki (Hiroshima).
It was a difficult development. The starting Yamaguchi (giant) presented the first goal four times. Although it was reversed by timely hitting Kikuchi and Suzuki five times, it was darkened six times immediately after. Yamazaki (Orix), the second fastest, was tied in three consecutive hits, and one death, two, and three bases. Otake (Giant)-Nakagawa (Giant) was connected, but Nigoro was allowed to win, and was also scored 2-4 in a timely infield hit.
The striking line struggled with the succession of Venezuela, which is linked to small increments. He was defeated by a foreign ball unique to change at hand and built a mountain of ordinary hits. In particular, Sakamoto, who is expected to be the main player in this tournament, won three hits and 12 hits in a battling game with Canada. Eight times, the opponent pitcher's turmoil helped him score a large amount, but the total was eight hits, less than the opponent's ten. Appointment of the first batter who was absent due to the withdrawal of Akiyama (Seibu) seems to be the key in the future.
Japan will play against Puerto Rico on the 6th and Taiwan on the 7th. The top two teams advance to the second round with the results of three games.
