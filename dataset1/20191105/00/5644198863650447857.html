      <p>LONDON: Everton midfielder Andre Gomes is expected to make a "full recovery" after undergoing surgery to repair a fracture dislocation of his ankle, the Premier League club said on Monday (Nov 4).</p>
      <p>The Portugal international suffered the shocking injury when he fell awkwardly following a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/football-gomes-suffers-ankle-injury-as-everton-deny-tottenham-12060144">challenge from Tottenham's Son Heung-min</a> in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Goodison Park.</p>

      <p>"Everton Football Club can confirm Andre Gomes underwent surgery to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle earlier today and the procedure went extremely well," a club statement said.</p>
      <p>It added: "The 26-year-old is expected to make a full recovery."</p>
      <p>Tottenham's players were also affected by the incident, with Son - who was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson for his challenge - in tears and Serge Aurier, who collided with Gomes, substituted.</p>
      <p>The Premier League said in a statement that Son's red card was for "endangering the safety of a player", but Spurs are expected to lodge an appeal against Atkinson's decision.</p>
      <p>Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino felt the injury led to an over-reaction.</p>
      <p>"It was clear it was never the intention of Son to create the problem that happened afterwards. It is unbelievable to see a red card," said the Spurs boss.</p>
      <p>"We all feel sorry for Andre. I want to send my best wishes to him and to his family in this tough moment. We want to send, on behalf of the squad, our best wishes."</p>
      <p>Though Everton cancelled out Dele Alli's opening goal with a Cenk Tosun header deep into the 12 minutes of time added on following Gomes' injury, there was little sense of celebration at full-time.</p>
      <p>Everton defender Mason Holgate said he and his teammates felt like they owed it to Gomes to get a result, but the draw still felt like a defeat.</p>
      <p>"It is hard when something like that happens to get going again but we showed fight and went again," Holgate said.</p>
      <p>"But it shows what we are about as a team. We got together and I think it drove us on a bit more once we got going, trying to do it for him.</p>
      <p>"It was really flat (in the dressing room). It was like we had been beaten."</p>
