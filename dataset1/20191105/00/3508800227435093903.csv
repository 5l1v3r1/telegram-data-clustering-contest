從意外誕生的天才：不可思議的「後天」學者症候群
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by 《科學人》粉絲團


我們想讓你知道的是因意外事故或疾病造成腦部受傷後，有時會奇蹟地喚醒某些潛藏的藝術與智能天份，這些案例使得科學家開始探尋可能的腦科學技術以喚醒我們內在沉睡的天賦。

重點提要

達斯汀霍夫曼主演的電影《雨人》，讓大眾知道學者症候群的存在，這些患者中，有些同時也患有自閉症，但他們天生就擁有優異的智能或藝術天賦。
後天學者症候群是另一種類似的狀況：人們從某種腦傷恢復後，展現出繪畫、音樂或心算等能力。
如果可以透過電流刺激等技術，或某種專注練習來刺激或抑制大腦中的某些線路，或許可以喚醒大多數人腦中可能存在的「內在學者」。

10歲的西瑞爾（Orlando Serrell）有一天被棒球擊中後昏迷，當他從腦傷恢復後，竟然開始可以說出受傷後的每一天是星期幾和當天的天氣，並能夠記得每一天大部份的生活細節。
2002年的一樁攻擊搶案中，受害者帕杰德（Jason Padgett）遭受嚴重的腦震盪，復原不久後，他開始看見一些他所謂的「影像」，並能畫出這些影像。當帕杰德把這些畫作給別人看時，他才知道這些不斷重複的相似幾何圖案，是所謂的「碎形」（fractal）。
這兩個人在受傷後都得到不可思議的「後天」學者症候群。比較廣為人知的學者症候群例子是1988年的電影《雨人》（Rain Man），先天學者症候群患者在早年就會出現某種特定的、異於常人的音樂、繪畫、數學、記憶或技藝能力，但同時也常伴隨著語言、社交以及其他心理障礙。例如，達斯汀霍夫曼（Dustin Hoffman）飾演的《雨人》主角雷蒙（Raymond Babbitt）就有驚人的數學能力、日期推算能力與極佳的記憶力，但同時也有嚴重自閉症的認知和行為障礙。
相較之下，在後天學者症候群患者中，近乎天才水準的藝術才能或驚人的智能，則是在頭部嚴重受創或腦傷後出現，這個現象讓大家開始懷疑，是否每個人的大腦裡其實存在著某種沉睡中的藝術或智能潛力：腦中有一位「內在學者」！若真如此，在沒有罹患疾病或受傷的情況下，有某種方法可以喚醒這些沉睡中的天賦。
腦中沉睡的天生雕刻家
我這大半輩子都在研究學者症候群，一直到1980年代中期，我以為學者症候群是一出生就存在，換言之，是一種先天症候群。但是當我看到傑出雕刻家克雷蒙（Alonzo Clemons）的雕塑展覽後，才改變了這樣的想法。克雷蒙在嬰兒時期似乎學習能力極佳，但大約3歲時，因為意外摔落，腦部受到嚴重的創傷，認知發展急遽減緩並造成嚴重的智能損害，包括詞彙和語言方面的障礙。但是同時，他也開始發展出特殊的雕塑能力，他可以用手邊任何的材料來雕塑，甚至是廚房裡的酥油。隨著他對動物形體的興趣越來越高，他可以在看了一眼雜誌上的馬兒照片後，半小時內就雕塑出栩栩如生、包含肌肉和肌腱等細節的立體馬兒。



克雷蒙的例子引起我對後天學者症候群的興趣，我查詢了醫學文獻後，發現只有幾則個案報告。1923年，心理學家米諾格（Blanche M. Minogue）描述了一名3歲兒童在腦膜炎後出現驚人的音樂能力；1980年，另一位美國心理學家布林克（T. L. Brink）記錄了一名遭子彈打傷左腦的9歲男童所展現的卓越技能，這名男童能夠拆解、重組並改造零件複雜的腳踏車，他還發明了一個可以模擬拳擊對手閃躲動作的練拳袋。
1980年以前的案例報告極少，代表這種情況很少見：腦震盪或中風通常不會提升認知能力或創造力，我決定繼續蒐集這些案例，到了2010年，我已經在全世界蒐集到319位學者症候群的案例，其中有32例是後天的。
我蒐集到的例子中，有一些是來自美國加州大學舊金山分校的神經科學家米勒（Bruce Miller）和同事的研究。從1996年起，米勒開始匯整12個額顳葉失智（FTD）的案例，這些年長患者在診斷出額顳葉失智後，表現出先前不曾擁有的音樂或藝術能力，有時候甚至會出現天才般的能力水準。額顳葉失智和阿茲海默症兩者不同之處在於，前者的大腦退化只出現在前額葉或顳葉，並非全面性的大腦退化。
額顳葉失智發生退化的腦區是左前顳葉與額葉眼眶面皮質，這兩個腦區負責抑制後腦專門處理眼睛所傳入訊息的視覺系統。這個疾病似乎可以關閉來自前腦的抑制訊號，並助長某種藝術感知能力。當抑制訊號消失後，大腦似乎就可以採用嶄新方式來處理影像和聲音。雖然前額葉的損傷會導致一些不恰當的行為，但是卻也釋放了藝術或其他的創造力。「額顳葉失智提供了一扇讓人意想不到的窗戶，讓我們看見大腦處理藝術的過程。」米勒如此說道。
更進一步的研究顯示：這些意外的天才是因為大腦某些區域的神經元活動減弱，伴隨著某些腦區的神經元活動增強所致。更精確地說，我認為它涉及了腦傷（通常是左半腦受傷，跟米勒的額顳葉失智案例類似）後的3種階段：首先是「動員」（recruitment），也就是未受傷的腦區（通常是右半腦）的神經元活動增強；接著是透過「重組」（rewiring）來鞏固先前不存在的新的神經連結；最後，新連結的腦區活動增強，並「釋放」（release）潛藏的天賦能力。
尋找誘發腦中天賦的方法
澳洲雪梨大學心智中心的齊（Richard Chi）和史奈德（Allan Snyder）採用了一項新穎的技術發現了一些證據，支持這些大腦變化可能就是獲得「學者能力」的神經基礎。利用跨顱直流電刺激（tDCS），他們在人類受試者身上誘發出類似的「學者能力」。這項技術利用極化（polarized）電流讓負責處理感覺、記憶、語言與其他認知訊息的左半腦的神經元活動下降，並同時提高右半腦（右前顳葉）的神經元活動。
在他們的研究中，一組受試者接受tDCS刺激，另一組則無，然後研究人員要求所有受試者解開一道困難的「九點謎」（nine-dot puzzle）：一種需要透過創造力來找出非慣例解法的謎題。受試者必須在不用紙筆的情況下，在腦中思索利用4條直線連結排列成九宮格形狀的9個點。研究結果發現，在接受tDCS刺激前，沒有人找到解法。其中29名受試者接受了「假刺激」（電極沒有放電，以測試是否存在安慰劑效應）之後，也仍然找不到解法。然而，真正接受tDCS刺激的受試者，約有40％（33名中有14名）成功提出答案。
為什麼電流刺激大腦之後，這些人的解題表現就突然變好了？因為這些「瞬間學者」（包含「天生學者」與「後天學者」）本來就「知道」許多從來沒有學習過的答案。雕刻家克雷蒙沒有受過藝術訓練，卻本能地知道如何製作雕刻品的內骨架，讓他雕塑的馬匹作品可以展現出動作中的姿態。
無論是早年就出現或因腦傷而來的學者症候群，他們所表現出來的天賦，有可能是透過某種遺傳方式而來。我們的生命一開始並不是一面乾淨的白板，然後才經過後天刻畫上各種教育和生命經驗。我們的大腦可能一出生就裝載了許多天生的屬性，讓我們可以處理各種資訊，並理解音樂、藝術或數學的「規則」，這些學者症候群患者，比一般人更能接觸到這些內在天賦。

The genius born from the accident: the incredible ""acquired"" scholar syndrome
05 Nov 2019, 00:12 by ""Science Man"" fan group


What we want you to know is that after a brain injury caused by an accident or disease, it sometimes miraculously awakens some hidden art and intellectual talents. These cases have led scientists to explore possible brain science techniques to wake us up to sleep. Talent.



Written by: Darold A. Treffert Translation: Xie Borang
Key summary

Dustin Hoffman's film ""Rain Man"" tells the public about the existence of scholarly syndromes. Some of these patients also have autism, but they are born with excellent intelligence or artistic talent.
Acquired scholars syndrome is another similar situation: people recover from a certain brain injury and show their ability to paint, music or mental arithmetic.
If you can use techniques such as current stimulation, or some kind of focused exercise to stimulate or inhibit certain lines in the brain, you may be able to awaken the ""inner scholars"" that may exist in most people's brains.

The 10-year-old Orlando Serrell was stunned after being hit by a baseball one day. When he recovered from a brain injury, he could start to say the day after the injury is the day of the week and the weather of the day, and can remember every day. Part of the details of life.
In an attack in 2002, the victim, Jason Padgett, suffered a severe concussion. Shortly after the recovery, he began to see what he called ""images"" and could draw these images. When Pajed showed these paintings to others, he knew that these repeated geometric patterns were so-called ""fractal.""
Both of them got incredible ""acquired"" scholar syndrome after the injury. A more well-known example of a scholarly syndrome is the 1988 film Rain Man, in which a person with congenital syndrome has a specific, unusual music, painting, math, memory or skill in his early years. It is also accompanied by language, social and other psychological barriers. For example, Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man"" protagonist Raymond Babbitt has amazing mathematical ability, date calculation ability and excellent memory, but also has a serious autism perception. And behavioral disorders.
In contrast, in the after-study syndrome patients, the artistic talent or the amazing intelligence of the near-genius level is caused by severe trauma or brain injury in the head. This phenomenon makes everyone wonder whether everyone’s brain actually There is some kind of artistic or intellectual potential in sleep: there is an ""inner scholar"" in the brain! If this is the case, there is a way to wake up these sleeping talents without suffering from illness or injury.
a natural sculptor who sleeps in the brain
I have been studying academic syndrome for most of my life. Until the mid-1980s, I thought that the scholar syndrome was born at birth, in other words, a congenital syndrome. But when I saw the sculpture exhibition of the outstanding sculptor Alonzo Clemons, I changed this idea. Cremon seems to have excellent learning ability during infancy, but when he was about 3 years old, his brain was severely traumatized by accidental fall, cognitive development slowed down and caused serious mental damage, including vocabulary and language barriers. But at the same time, he also began to develop a special sculptural ability, he can use any material on hand to sculpture, even the ghee in the kitchen. As he became more interested in animal forms, he could take a look at the horse photos in the magazine and, within an hour, he sculptured a three-dimensional horse with lifelike details including muscles and tendons.



Cremon's example caused me to be interested in acquired scholars' syndrome. After consulting the medical literature, I found that there were only a few cases reported. In 1923, psychologist Blanche M. Minogue described a 3-year-old child with amazing musical ability after meningitis; in 1980, another American psychologist TL Brink recorded The excellent skills of a 9-year-old boy who was injured by a bullet in the left brain. The boy was able to disassemble, reorganize and remodel a complex bicycle. He also invented a training box that simulates the boxing opponent’s dodging action. bag.
There are very few case reports before 1980, which is rare in this case: concussion or stroke usually does not improve cognitive ability or creativity. I decided to continue collecting these cases. By 2010, I have collected 319 people around the world. Of the cases of scholars' syndrome, 32 of them were acquired.
Some of the examples I collected were from Bruce Miller, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues. Since 1996, Miller has begun to consolidate 12 cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which, after diagnosing the forehead leaf dementia, exhibits musical or artistic abilities that were previously not available, sometimes There will even be a genius level of competence. The difference between frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease is that the former's brain degeneration only occurs in the prefrontal or temporal lobe, not a comprehensive brain degeneration.
The degenerative brain regions of the frontotemporal lobe dementia are the left anterior temporal lobe and the frontal lobe cortex. These two brain regions are responsible for suppressing the visual system of the posterior brain specifically for the message transmitted by the eye. The disease seems to shut down the suppression signal from the forebrain and encourage some kind of artistic perception. When the suppression signal disappears, the brain seems to be able to process images and sounds in new ways. Although damage to the prefrontal lobes can lead to inappropriate behavior, it also releases art or other creativity. ""Forehead leaf dementia provides an unexpected window that allows us to see how the brain processes art,"" Miller said.
Further research shows that these unexpected geniuses are due to the weakening of neuronal activity in certain areas of the brain, accompanied by increased neuronal activity in certain brain regions. More precisely, I think it involves three stages after a brain injury (usually a left hemi-brain injury, similar to Miller's frontotemporal dementia case): first, ""recruitment"", that is, not injured. The brain activity of the brain area (usually the right hemisphere) is enhanced; followed by ""rewiring"" to consolidate new neural connections that did not exist before; finally, the newly linked brain area activity is enhanced and ""released"" (release) hidden talent ability.
Find ways to induce talent in the brain
Richard Chi and Allan Snyder of the Centre for Mental Sciences at the University of Sydney in Australia have used a novel technique to discover some evidence that supporting these brain changes may be the neural basis for gaining “scholar abilities”. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), they induced similar ""scholar abilities"" in human subjects. This technique uses polarized currents to reduce neuronal activity in the left hemisphere responsible for processing sensations, memory, language, and other cognitive messages, while simultaneously increasing neuronal activity in the right hemisphere (right anterior temporal lobe).
In their study, one group received tDCS stimulation and the other did not. The researchers then asked all subjects to unravel a difficult ""nine-dot puzzle"": a need to create Try to find the puzzles of non-routine solutions. Subjects must think in the brain without using a pen and paper to use nine straight lines to form nine points in a nine-square shape. The study found that no one found a solution before receiving tDCS stimulation. After 29 subjects received ""false stimulation"" (the electrode was not discharged to test for the presence of a placebo effect), there was still no solution. However, approximately 40% of subjects who actually received tDCS stimulation (14 out of 33) successfully presented their answers.
Why does the performance of these people suddenly become better after the current stimulates the brain? Because these ""instant scholars"" (including ""natural scholars"" and ""acquired scholars"") have ""knowed"" many answers that they have never learned. The sculptor Cremon did not receive artistic training, but instinctively knew how to make the inner skeleton of the sculpture, so that his sculpture of the horse works can show the posture in action.
Whether it is a scholar's syndrome that emerged in the early years or because of a brain injury, the talent they display may be derived from some genetic method. Our life was not a clean whiteboard at first, but then it was followed by various education and life experiences. Our brains may be loaded with many innate attributes at birth, allowing us to process a variety of information and understand the ""rules"" of music, art or mathematics. These scholars' syndrome patients are more exposed to these inherent talents than the average person.
