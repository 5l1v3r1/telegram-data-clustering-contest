Cam Newton out for season with lingering foot injury
05 Nov 2019 by Adam Zielonka
The Carolina Panthers placed Cam Newton on injured reserve with a foot injury that’s sidelined him since Week 2, ending the quarterback’s season.
Newton suffered the injury during a preseason game, but came back to play in the Panthers’ first two games of the regular season before being held out. The injury was first thought to be a sprain, but later was diagnosed as a Lisfranc fracture.
Reports said that Newton’s injury was not improving enough over the past several weeks, in which he has been rehabbing and unable to practice.
With the Panthers’ decision, Kyle Allen will start at quarterback for the rest of the season, including when the Washington Redskins visit Carolina in Week 13.
Carolina general manager Marty Hurney said in a statement that Newton still needed “significant time” to fully heal.
