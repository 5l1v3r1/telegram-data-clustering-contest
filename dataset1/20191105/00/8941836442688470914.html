      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Court documents say a Kansas City man had a blood-alcohol level that was three times the legal limit when he caused a deadly crash.</p>
      <p>Thirty-nine-year-old Paul Dowdell was charged Saturday with driving while intoxicated in the deadly collision. No attorney is listed for him in online court records.</p>
      <p>The Jackson County prosecutor’s office says Dowell had a blood-alcohol level of .295 in January when he crossed a lane divider on Interstate 470 in a Cadillac Eldorado and struck a tractor-trailer. The truck’s driver, Daniel Shafer, was ejected when the rig crashed into a concrete barrier. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Dowdell left the hospital against medical advice before an officer arrived. He was arrested Saturday.</p>
