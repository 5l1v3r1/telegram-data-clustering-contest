      <h1>11K Scientists: Please Panic, Climate Change Will Kill Us All</h1>

      <h3>Global Warning</h3>
      <p>More than 11,000 scientists in 153 nations have endorsed a newly published <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806">statement</a> on climate change — and it’s extremely gloomy.</p>
      <p>“The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected,” the authors wrote. “It is more severe than anticipated, threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity.”</p>
      <h3>Climate Emergency</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806">statement</a>, published on Tuesday in the journal <i>BioScience</i>, includes decades’ worth of hard data and scientific analysis on climate trends to support the authors’ claims. It also includes a slew of concrete actions humanity could take to address climate change, from replacing fossil fuels with renewables to reducing meat consumption.</p>
      <p>“We declare clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency,” the scientists wrote. “To secure a sustainable future, we must change how we live. [This] entails major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems.”</p>
      <h3>Decades of Destruction</h3>
      <p>The timing of the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-monumental-alliance-of-world-scientists-declare-a-climate-emergency">statement’s publication</a> was appropriate for two reasons.</p>
      <p>First, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the first world climate conference. And just one day prior to the statement’s publication, the United States <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">officially notified</a> the United Nations that it’s leaving the Paris Climate Agreement — potentially humanity’s best hope of avoiding the disaster foreshadowed by the authors.</p>
