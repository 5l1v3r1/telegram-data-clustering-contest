      <p>If you never have much luck with your lottery numbers, a move to Birmingham might boost your chances.</p>
      <p>The National Lottery has revealed the luckiest postcodes in the UK as part of its 25th birthday celebrations.</p>
      <p>A staggering 5,500 millionaires have been made since the lottery launched in 1994, according to the statistics, and 168 of them are from the Birmingham postcode.</p>
      <p>While the West Midlands city takes the top spot for players banking a seven-figure sum, some 133 players with a Belfast postcode have scooped a million each.</p>
      <p>Lottery luck also lives in Glasgow, which takes third place with 125 millionaires made since the lottery launched.</p>
      <p>The statistics by the National Lottery also looked at where players are most likely to win a prize of more than £50,000.</p>
      <p>Galashiels, a town in the Scottish borders, has seen the most big winners by local population.</p>

      <p>On average, one in every 894 players has banked a big prize since the lottery's launch, while traditionally lucky Romford in Essex and Cleveland in the north-east of England have seen one in 922 and one in 952 respectively.</p>
      <p>Data from the last three years suggests Leicester locals have been in luck recently, climbing the top 10 with 30 millionaires made since September 2016.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser for the National Lottery, said: "We go to every corner of the country to pay out big prizes and make millionaires.</p>
      <p>"With on average seven new millionaires made every week, you can be sure we'll be visiting somewhere close to you very soon.</p>
      <p>"Over the last 25 years, The National Lottery has been making amazing things happen.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to our National Lottery players, 565,000 Good Cause grants have been given out to projects big and small, that's the equivalent of 200 life-changing projects in every UK postcode district making a huge impact on communities all over the country.</p>
      <p>"On top of this, we have celebrated so many lucky winners who have won life-changing sums of money - here's to another 25 years of making dreams come true."</p>
