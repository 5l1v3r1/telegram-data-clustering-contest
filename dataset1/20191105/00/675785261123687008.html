      <p>A shivering <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dogs">dog</a> was minutes from death after being locked in a cage and thrown into a freezing lake.</p>
      <p>The black and white puppy was spotted half-submerged in the crate in Kaufman Lake near Champaign in Illinois, US, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bryant Fritz, a science teacher, dashed to save the dog.</p>
      <p>"I am a big dog lover, I have a dog at home. ‘I just saw an animal in need, and I just figured that by the time that somebody else got her it would be too late," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was pretty clear when I got the dog out that it had been there for several hours."</p>
      <p>Mr Fritz, who was fishing in the lake at the time, added: "When I got her up to the shore, there was blood all over the place. She was missing a bunch of fur on the back side, and the bottom of her paws were missing skin.</p>

      <p>"She probably weighed 15 to 20 pounds; she was definitely a puppy. She was shaking so bad.</p>
      <p>"Her eyes were shut. She was so miserable. I took her to my truck and turned up the heat as high as I could."</p>
      <p>The University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital has since been caring for the pooch and says she will be well enough to be rehomed soon.</p>

      <p>She had hypothermia and wounds across its body.</p>
      <p>Chris Beuoy, a spokesperson for the vets, said: "We weren’t sure if the dog would need additional care for her wounds.</p>
      <p>"But she received more treatment for her wounds on Sunday."</p>
