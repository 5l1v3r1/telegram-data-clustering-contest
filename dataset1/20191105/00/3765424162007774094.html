      <p>The new six storey Parliament building in Mt Hampden outside the capital Harare is taking shape with, China, the funders of the project saying it is ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>According to the Chinese Embassy, the project was meant to take 32 months to complete but the building could take lesser time to complete.</p>
      <p>“The new Parliament building project is ahead of schedule as construction was supposed to last for 32 months. 11 months on, the six-storey building has taken shape. <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-Chinaworkethic.html">#Chinaworkethic</a>,” said the embassy in a statement.</p>
