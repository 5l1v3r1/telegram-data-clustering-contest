      <p>A suspected member of the dreaded Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) who was part of  President Emerson Mnangagwa’s advance  security team  ahead of the Zanu-PF leader’s visit in Masvingo was arrested after an attempted robbery in the country’s oldest city.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa was in Masvingo Saturday to president over the graduation ceremony at the Great Zimbabwe University.</p>
      <p>One of Mnangagwa’s spies, Nkosiphile Sibanda, 30, was arrested a day earlier and has since appeared in court facing robbery charges.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Candice Kasere  remanded him in custody to 14 November.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Malvern Mapako told the court that on the November, 1 ,  Sibanda and his accomplice only identified as Tsano who is still at large, were armed with two pistols when they pounced on an illegal money changer at a local food outlet in Masvingo branch.</p>
      <p>It is the State’s case that the two masqueraded as genuine travellers who wanted to exchange some US into South African Rands and were allowed to enter into their victim’s car.</p>
      <p>The Court was told while inside the vehicle the two produced their service fire arms and threatened to shoot the money changer if he fails to comply with their orders.</p>
      <p>The two then demanded to be given all the money their victim had in his position.</p>
      <p>However, the victim allegedly quickly got out of the vehicle with his satchel containing some money and sort assistance from other money changers.</p>
      <p>On realising they had been caught out, Sibanda and his accomplice took to their heels with a mob of money changers in pursuit.</p>
      <p>The two then fired shots to scare away the  mob but Sibanda was not lucky enough to make good his escape, he was cornered leading to his arrest</p>
      <p>After his arrest police recovered a CZ pistol with a magazine of four live rounds of ammunition.</p>
