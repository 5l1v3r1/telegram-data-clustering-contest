      <p>The Canon E05 Rebel is one of the most popular DSLRs on the market and for good reason. Its rugged, reliable build combined with smooth, intuitive hardware makes for a camera that can shoot anything from Wedding or Portrait Photography to Sports or Fashion. It even films video at 1080p HD resolution, so you can shoot behind-the-scenes film of your photoshoots or start your own YouTube channel.  </p>
      <p>The Canon E05 Rebel is also known for its reasonable price point, making it a favorite for smartphone photographers looking to join the world of DSLRs. Now it's even cheaper to do so, as you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-T6-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=blackfridaylinesdealstech-11052019-20&amp;linkId=8d8bf7fa37eeaab7914e761df816c399&amp;language=en_US">save $150 on the Canon EO5</a> on Amazon.</p>
      <p>This bundle deals also comes with 18-55mm lens and a 75-300mm, meaning you can shoot both close-ups as well as long distances straight out of the box. A carrying sweetens the deal, as far as accessories go. As if this weren't enough, they're throwing in a free 32GB memory card. DSLRs use up a lot of memory, so you'll be needing that.  </p>

The camera is capable of recording video at 4K at 60 frames per second or 1,080p at up to an impressive 240 frames per second. That’s perfect for capturing those high-movement shots.</p>
      <p>The camera is ultra-portable too. It measures in at only 2.44 inches wide and 1.26 inches thick and has a built-in gyroscope to help ensure that footage is relatively shake-free, and once you’re done recording, it’s easy to transfer your footage using the accompanying app.</p>
      <p>The GoPro Hero7 Black is available from Amazon for $326, which is $74 off its normal price of $400. That marks one of the best discounts we’ve seen for the camera so far.</p>

      <p>This camera is easily one of the best DSLR cameras on the market. It has all the features you would expect from a high-end camera, plus it has a touch screen for easy control, an excellent autofocus system, great connectivity features and more. It can shoot video in 4K, so you’ll get excellent-quality video performance, and it has a burst mode capable of capturing 7 photos per second. </p>
      <p>This particular deal is for the body only, so you will have to buy lenses separately. That said, you’re saving a ton of cash here — you can get the camera for only $2,499 — which is a massive $800 off its normal price.</p>
