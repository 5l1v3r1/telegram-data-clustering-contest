      <p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - The mother of a Russian man jailed in Greece pending three extradition requests for alleged bitcoin fraud has appealed for his release, ahead of another legal bid to end his detention.</p>
      <p>Vera Vinnik said Tuesday that Greek authorities have shown “no mercy” to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexander-vinnik/">Alexander Vinnik</a>, who has been imprisoned for 27 months even though his lawyers say he hasn’t been charged with anything in Greece.</p>
      <p>Greece’s supreme court will assess Wednesday whether to annul its previous, separate decisions to extradite the 40-year-old Vinnik to the U.S. and to France.</p>
      <p>Vinnik was arrested during a Greek family holiday in 2017 on a request from the U.S., which accuses him of laundering billions of dollars using bitcoin, the virtual currency.</p>

        <p>Should Vinnik win Wednesday’s appeal, he’ll be freed or extradited to Russia.</p>
