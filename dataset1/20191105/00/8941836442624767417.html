      <p>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Members and employees of the governing board for Iowa’s public universities could soon be barred from gambling on the college teams they help oversee.</p>
      <p>A policy proposed by the Board of Regents would bar board members and staff from betting on games involving the Iowa Hawkeyes, the Iowa State Cyclones or the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-northern-iowa/">University of Northern Iowa</a> Panthers.</p>
      <p>The board will consider adopting the policy at its meeting next week in Cedar Falls.</p>
      <p>A summary says the goal is to “remove any question of a potential conflict of interest” now that sports wagering has been legalized in Iowa.</p>

        <p>The prohibition would apply to both in-state and out-of-state casinos and would also bar regents from providing any non-public information to others making bets. Fantasy sports contests would be excluded.</p>
