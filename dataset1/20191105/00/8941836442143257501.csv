Air Force space squadron to operate out of Hawaii facility

05 Nov 2019

LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) - The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission.
The Garden Island reported Tuesday that the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai.
Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information.
Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions.
Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022.
