Penalty Shootouts To Remain In Ulster Despite Opposition
05 Nov 2019, 09:50 by Michael Corry

The Ulster Council has confirmed that ‘finish-on-the-day’ protocols will remain in place for the remainder of the Ulster club championship after two games were decided by penalty shootouts at the weekend.

In Brewster Park, Derrygonnelly progressed to the senior semi-final following a classic encounter with Tyrone champions Trillick. The Fermanagh champions eventually prevailing 6-5 on penalty kicks after Lee Brennan struck the post for Trillick in sudden death.
In the Ulster junior semi-final at Celtic Park, another Tyrone club, Rock St Patrick’s, lost to Donegal side Buncrana after another shootout.
The decision to decide important fixtures via this method has not gone down well in certain circles with Declan Bogue reporting that the Ulster Council are sticking to the recommendation set down from Congress earlier this year.



PRO Declan Woods also commented that the decision was made to move away from free-kicks competitions to decide fixtures, something that very nearly happened in this season’s Antrim semi-final if not for the interference of county board chairman Ciaran McCavana.
Woods also understands that this method is in place in other parts of the country.
“My understanding is, this was the recommended directive coming out of Congress this year. That ‘finish on the day’ would come in and we would move away from free-kicks.” Woods told Bogue.
“Meath had shootouts, there were some instances of penalties in the Meath championship I can remember. Overall, I am not sure it was adopted everywhere.



“Clearly, Donegal didn’t put it into their by-laws because they weren’t in a position to implement it.
“So it was at the discretion of the two clubs (Naomh Conaill and Gaoth Dobhair) and Naomh Conaill wouldn’t agree, Gaoth Dobhair would agree to it, so they had to keep going on with another replay.”
The method will remain as is for the upcoming semi-finals according to Woods but if the Ulster decider finishes in a draw then a replay will be required.
