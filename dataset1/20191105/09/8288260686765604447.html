      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/hal-robson-kanu">Hal Robson-Kanu</a> then wrapped up the points from the penalty spot after replacing Charlie Austin.</p>
      <p>Robson-Kanu's display from the bench was one of several factors that earned praise from Albion supporters at the bet365 Stadium and on social media, as well as the quality Slaven Bilic's side showed on the ball.</p>

        <i>Here's just some of the reactions from Baggies supporters after an eighth win of the League campaign.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>@Johnwba01:</b> ROBSON KANUUUUU WHAT A PLAYER</p>
      <p><b>@ALBIONFANTV:</b> Just announce promotion!</p>
      <p><b>Andy Caulton:</b> Death by passing... Sweet to have this as our mantra again</p>
      <p><b>Andy Leeman:</b> Perfect away performance. Easy 3 points. Robson Kanu deserves to start now. Might not be the best technically but gives us everything. Far better movement and hold up play than Austin. That's all we need with the 3 behind him. #wba</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@jjcole180:</b> HRK: - scored the best penalty anyone has ever seen - did a stepover while falling down - is better than messi</p>
      <p><b>Dan Sirrell:</b> The away fans were unbelievable tonight</p>
      <p><b>Mr Christopher Ellis:</b> Why does winning feel normal</p>
      <p><b>@mistydusty:</b> This might be the first time in my life I’m confident about the Albion. They put everything in whilst maintaining a certain composure. Soooooooo cool. I just love it. I just love this team</p>
      <p><b>Arthur Godfrey:</b> Ajayi is an absolute gem, gets better and better</p>
      <p><b>@KeithSu51736990:</b> the thing i enjoy most is we didn't really click going forward last night... and still won comfortably!</p>
