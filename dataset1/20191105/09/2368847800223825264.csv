伊朗人質事件40年 美國再對哈米尼9名幕僚祭制裁

05 Nov 2019, 09:15

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】伊朗狂熱分子40年前衝進美國駐德黑蘭大使館釀444天的「伊朗人質事件」。4日，德黑蘭有數以千計民眾上街示威，美國則祭出對伊朗最高領袖哈米尼的9名幕僚的全新制裁。
「伊朗人質事件」是歷來第一次有電視幾乎即時轉播的全球危機，當時學生衝進美國大使館，挾持數十名美國外交人員和警衛為人質。事件後美伊緊張關係從未改善，也再也沒有恢復外交。
美國4日宣布對伊朗最高領袖哈米尼（Ayatollah Ali Khamenei）的9名幕僚施加制裁的同時，國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）提及40年前這場人質事件。
「40年過去了，德黑蘭的革命政權屢屢證明，他們掌權後的第一場行動，凸顯其邪惡性格。」
美國財政部表示，這些人是因為在國內受「壓迫」，並把「恐怖主義」輸出到海外而受制裁，其中包括多位知名人士，像是司法部長萊希（Ebrahim Raisi），以及哈米尼的外交政策顧問維拉雅蒂（Ali Akbar Velayati）等。

美國總統川普於2017年上任後，美國對伊朗態度轉趨強硬，於2018年退出核協議，恢復制裁伊朗；伊朗當局則於今年5月決定暫停遵守部分核協議承諾。
伊朗當局4日也表示，濃縮鈾產量已增加超過10倍。對此，歐洲聯盟警告，歐盟對核協議的支持，要看伊朗是否遵守承諾。德國外交部長馬斯（Heiko Maas）呼籲伊朗回歸協議。

Iranian hostage incident for 40 years, the United States again sanctioned 9 monks in Hamini

05 Nov 2019, 09:15

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Iranian fanatics rushed into the US Embassy in Tehran 40 years ago to brew 444 days of ""Iranian hostage incident."" On the 4th, thousands of people in Tehran took to the streets to demonstrate, and the United States offered new sanctions against the nine aides of Iran’s supreme leader, Hamini.
The ""Iranian hostage incident"" was the first time in the world that there was a global crisis of almost instantaneous broadcast of television. At that time, students rushed into the US Embassy and held dozens of US diplomats and guards hostage. After the incident, the tension between the United States and Iraq has never improved, and no diplomacy has ever been restored.
On the 4th, the United States announced that it would impose sanctions on the nine aides of Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned the hostage incident 40 years ago.
""Thirty years have passed, and the revolutionary regime in Tehran has repeatedly proved that their first action after taking power has highlighted its evil character.""
The U.S. Treasury Department said that these people were sanctioned because they were ""oppressed"" in the country and exported ""terrorism"" overseas, including many prominent figures, such as Justice Minister Ebrahim Raisi and Hami. Nigeria's foreign policy adviser Ali Akbar Velayati and so on.

After US President Trump took office in 2017, the United States turned its attitude toward Iran tough, and in 2018, it withdrew from the nuclear agreement and resumed sanctions against Iran. The Iranian authorities decided in May this year to suspend compliance with some of the nuclear agreement commitments.
The Iranian authorities also said on the 4th that enriched uranium production has increased more than 10 times. In this regard, the European Union warned that the EU's support for the nuclear agreement depends on whether Iran complies with its commitments. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called for Iran to return to the agreement.
