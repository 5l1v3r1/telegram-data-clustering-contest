Harry Styles has announced that he will release a new album by the end of the year.
Fine Line, the former One Direction member’s second solo album, will be released on 13 December.
Styles made the announcement on Monday via social media.
He also shared the album’s artwork, a photo taken by the English fashion photographer Tim Walker, which shows Styles posing in a fuchsia shirt tucked into high-waisted, white trousers.
Styles’s first solo effort, Harry Styles, came out in May 2017.
Fans have long awaited his new release, and rumours of a second solo album ramped up last month. He recently hinted that his new album is the reason he turned down the role of Prince Eric in the forthcoming Disney remake of The Little Mermaid. 
The singer released a new single titled “Lights Up” in October this year.
Styles is scheduled to appear on Saturday Night Live as both host and musical guest on 16 November.
On the occasion, he will join the prestigious list of artists who have received the honour of a double billing on the sketch show, which includes Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.
