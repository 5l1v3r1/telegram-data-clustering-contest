【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】10月2日至30日，「真善忍國際美展」在西班牙馬德里洛佩﹒德﹒維加文化中心舉行。兩千多名參觀者欣賞了展出的畫作，許多人被這些藝術作品深深打動。
明慧網報導，這屆美展展出了超過12位藝術家的油畫和水彩畫作品。這些藝術家都是法輪功（也稱法輪大法）修煉者。他們用畫筆展現了法輪大法修煉的美好和發生在中國的針對堅守信仰的法輪大法修煉者的人權迫害。
自1999年以來，中共對法輪功的迫害持續至今。許多善良的民眾表達了他們對法輪功的支持，並希望儘快結束迫害。

馬德里一所學校的老師和學生觀看了美展的畫作，在仔細欣賞了每幅畫作之後，法輪功學員向他們介紹了法輪大法的修煉，以及這個功法在中國遭到的迫害。

法輪功於1992年在中國大陸傳出，指導人們按照「真、善、忍」原則要求自己，提高人們的身體素質和精神境界，至今洪傳到世界一百多個國家和地區，深受各族裔民眾的歡迎。
然而1999年7月以中共前黨魁江澤民為首的邪惡集團對法輪功發動了滅絕人性的迫害，給法輪功學員及其家屬帶來深重的災難。
許多人在留言簿中寫下了他們的感受：
瑪麗亞﹒何賽（Maria José）寫道：「我希望很快人們都能了解這場迫害，以便這樣的迫害不再發生。」
阿瑪麗亞﹒莎克蒂（Amalia Shakti）寫道：「傑出的畫展打動人心，與真正重要的主題聯繫在一起，表現人性昇華後的崇高。一次美好而震撼的經歷。」
另一位深有感觸的觀賞者在留言簿上寫道：「這次展覽是情感的昇華，傳遞了和平與諧和。」
