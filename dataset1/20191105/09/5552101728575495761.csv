【搞懂承攬僱傭】月薪60萬「被離職」　告不贏公司有原因
05 Nov 2019, 09:58 by 劉以親, 陳俊銘
勞務糾紛時有所聞，不僅有承攬與僱傭之間的爭議，另一種委任與僱傭之間的訟訴也不少。
1名北富銀副總2016年考績被評為乙等，隔年被公司要求主動辭職，該名副總雖不同意，但公司隨即將工作轉交他人負責，並通知他解除契約，雙方於是告上法庭。
副總主張，自己歷年考績都是優等，與公司是僱傭關係，公司應依《勞基法》規定終止契約，因而提起「確認僱傭關係存在」訴訟，但公司主張，與該名副總之間是委任關係，副總除了上下班不必打工，還配有公務車及司機等福利，不同於《勞基法》所適用的一般勞工，屬於《公司法》所稱的「委任經理人」，雙方不具有人格、經濟、組織的從屬性。
一般而言，勞動契約的當事人一方是雇主，另一方是勞工，學理上認定勞工這方會從以下3個面向判斷是否從屬於公司：
一、人格從屬性：受僱人需服從雇主權威，並有接受雇主懲戒或制裁的義務。
二、經濟從屬性：受僱人不是為自己的營業勞動，而是為他人的目的勞動。
三、組織從屬性：受僱人與同僚之間居於分工合作狀態。
而這場勞務糾紛歷經一、二審，法院皆認定雙方是委任關係，而非僱傭關係，最終該名副總上訴至高等法院，今年5月審理認定，該名副總每月本薪60萬元、午餐費2,000元，首年保障年終獎金1,590萬元，他2008～2017年在職10年期間共領2億多元的酬勞，其中高達51～72%是工作績效，雙方欠缺經濟從屬性，屬於委任關係、而非僱傭關係，因此判定北富銀勝訴。

[Understanding the employment of employment] The monthly salary of 600,000 ""being resigned""
05 Nov 2019, 09:58 by Liu Yiqin, Chen Junming
There have been complaints about labor disputes, not only between the contract and the employment, but also between the other appointments and employment.
One of the vice presidents of Beifuye was rated as B in 2016. He was asked to resign by the company in the following year. Although the vice president disagreed, the company immediately transferred the work to others and informed him to cancel the contract. The two parties then sue. court.
The deputy general advocated that his performance appraisal for the past years was excellent, and the company was an employment relationship. The company should terminate the contract in accordance with the provisions of the ""Laoji Law"", and therefore filed a ""confirmation of the existence of the employment relationship"" lawsuit, but the company claimed that it was between the vice president and the vice president. In the appointment relationship, the deputy general does not have to work in addition to going to work, and is also equipped with the benefits of official vehicles and drivers. Unlike the general labor applicable to the ""Laoji Law"", it is a ""appointed manager"" in the ""Company Law"". Has the personality, economy, and organizational attributes.
Generally speaking, the party to the labor contract is the employer and the other party is the laborer. It is theoretically determined that the laborer will judge whether it is subordinate to the company from the following three aspects:
First, the personality of the property: the servant must obey the employer's authority, and has the obligation to accept the employer's punishment or sanctions.
Second, the economic dependency: the servant is not working for his own business, but for the purpose of others.
Third, the organization's attributes: the employer and his peers are in a state of division of labor and cooperation.
After the first and second trials of the labor dispute, the court found that the two parties were appointed, not the employment relationship. In the end, the deputy general appealed to the High Court. In May this year, the trial found that the vice president had a monthly salary of 600,000 yuan. The lunch fee is 2,000 yuan. The first year guarantees a year-end bonus of 15.9 million yuan. He has received more than 200 million yuan of compensation during his 10 years of service in 2008-2017, of which 51 to 72% is job performance. Appointment relationship, not employment relationship, therefore determined that North Fu Yin won the case.
