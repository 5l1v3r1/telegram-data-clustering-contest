Cape Town - Charlize Theron took home the Hollywood Career Achievement Award at the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday.
The 44-year-old was presented with the award by her Bombshell co-star Nicole Kidman, who received the award at last year's ceremony.
The South African actress was overcome with emotion when Nicole referred to her as one of her heroes.
During her speech, Charlize said that her role as Aileen Wuornos in the 2003 movie Monster - for which she won an Academy Award - was her big life-changing role.
She also thanked all the directors, writers, producers, actors and studios who took the change on her, reports the Hollywood Reporter.
""I only have the career I have because so many people in this industry have either mentored me, took me under their wing, showed me kindness and pushed me as far as I could ever go in my career,"" said Charlize.
