奶奶快死沒人敢說實話　《別告訴她》反映華裔文化衝擊
05 Nov 2019, 09:15 by 娛樂組
移民到美國的一家人，突然接到老家的奶奶罹患癌症、且很有可能不久於世的消息，於是千里迢迢回去做最後一次探親，只是沒人敢對長輩說實話。改編導演自身經歷的《別告訴她》，反映了華裔社會在東西文化夾擊下的左右為難。
根據華裔導演王子逸（Lulu Wang）自身經歷所改編的電影《別告訴她》（The Farewell），透過早已移民到美國社會定居的華裔女孩比莉一家人，發現遠在中國老家的奶奶生病、很有可能就不久於人世了。於是全家假裝表弟要結婚、回去團聚、把握看奶奶的最後一次機會。但是比莉卻一直掙扎著到底該不該對奶奶說實話？隱瞞病情難道不會良心不安嗎？
《別告訴她》導演王子逸出生於北京，6歲跟隨家人移民邁阿密，如同電影的設定，本人和奶奶的關係很親。對於在《瘋狂亞洲富豪》中逗趣詮釋富二代的亞裔女星奧卡菲娜（Awkwafina）飾演的女主角比莉，導演王子逸說：「電影中的女主角，很大程度上反映了我的心境，面對家人為奶奶編織的善意謊言，也讓她常有猶豫，認為奶奶有知道真相的權利，有權利決定自己該如何度過餘生。」
電影中探討華人社會中的「善意謊言」，發人省思，導演更是說到：「美國的族裔非常多元化，此類電影能夠帶領大家思考如何平衡族裔間的不同特點，不論是美國人、華人、還是其他的亞裔移民，每個人都有不同的生活方式，但身分的重疊又給交流增加可能性」。
整部片有70％都是中文對白，加上又在中國長春拍攝，卻在日舞影首映後獲得好評，在爛番茄網站上得到近滿分的好評推薦。導演王子逸到現在都還沒對奶奶說實話，拍片時找來奶奶的妹妹特別客串。而原本整個家族以為電影還沒拍完，奶奶很可能就會過世了，但誰曉得到現在她人還好好的，所以也不打算讓她看《別告訴她》，免得被她猜到怎麼回事。

The family who immigrated to the United States suddenly received news that their grandmother’s grandmother had cancer and was likely to be in the world soon, so she went back to do the last visit, but no one dared to tell the truth to the elders. Adapting the director’s own experience, “Don’t Tell Her,” reflects the dilemma of Chinese-American society under the influence of East and West cultures.
According to Luf Wang’s own film, The Farewell, the Chinese girl who lived in the American society has found that her grandmother, who is far away from China’s hometown, is sick. It is possible that it will soon be alive. So the whole family pretended that the cousin was going to get married, go back to reunion, and grasp the last chance to see Grandma.

""Don't tell her"" director Wang Ziyi was born in Beijing. At the age of 6, he followed his family to immigrate to Miami. As with the movie, my relationship with my grandmother is very close. For the actress Billie, who plays the role of the second generation of Asian actress Awkwafina in ""Frenzy Asia's Regal,"" director Prince Yi said: ""The heroine in the film largely reflects My state of mind, in the face of the goodwill lies that my family woven for my grandmother, also made her often hesitate to think that Grandma has the right to know the truth and has the right to decide how to spend the rest of her life.""
In the film, the ""good faith lies"" in Chinese society are thought out. The director even said: ""The ethnicity in the United States is very diverse. Such films can lead everyone to think about how to balance the different characteristics of the ethnic group, whether it is Americans, Chinese, and other Asian immigrants, each with a different lifestyle, but the overlap of identities increases the likelihood of communication.""
70% of the entire film is in Chinese, and it was shot in Changchun, China, but it was well received after the premiere of the Japanese dance, and it was well received on the rotten tomato website. The director, Prince Yi, has not yet told the truth to her grandmother, and she has been looking for a special guest appearance for her grandmother. The original family thought that the film had not been filmed, Grandma is likely to pass away, but who knows that she is still good now, so she does not intend to let her see ""Don't tell her"", so as not to be guessed by her. thing.
