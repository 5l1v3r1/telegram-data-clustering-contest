MORE and more people believe that a concrete plan of action is required to address the worsening problem of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, particularly in the rural areas.
Aware of the situation, two senators now want a Senate inquiry, in aid of legislation, into how to strengthen the comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) and curb teenage pregnancies.
They are Senators Sherwin “Win” Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate committee on basic education, arts and culture, and Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, head of the Senate committee on finance.
“Despite the existence of CSE and the Reproductive Health (RH) Law, teenage pregnancy rates in the country are still alarming,” according to Senator “Win” Gatchalian of Valenzuela City.
Gatchalian said “this prompts us to revisit and strengthen our existing policies so we can save teenagers from getting pregnant and falling into the trap of intergenerational poverty.”
Earlier, the Commission on Population and Development (PopCom) called for the declaration of a national emergency on teenage pregnancy in this Asian nation of more than 100 million people.
PopCom reported that between 2011 and 2017, pregnancies in the 10-14 age group increased by 50 percent from around 1,000 to 2,000 cases, 30-50 of which are among 10-year olds.
A Philippine Statistics Authority survey also showed that family matters or marriage is the top reason why female out-of-school children and youth aged 6-24 are not attending school.
Of course, we share the view of various quarters, including members of Congress, that teaching CSE in schools plays a stellar role in curbing teenage pregnancies across the country.
