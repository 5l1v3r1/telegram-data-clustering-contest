      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The last-minute switch to hold the U.N. climate change talks in Madrid will offer a great challenge, but also an “amazing” opportunity to ensure sustainable finance is part of the agenda, Spain’s acting economy minister said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The challenge posed by climate change will require both public and private investment, Nadia Calvino told a conference in Madrid. “We have assessed that the investment needed to tackle the ecological transition in Spain only amounts to around 235 billion euros from now until 2030.”</p>
      <p>The talks, known formally as COP25, will be held Dec. 2-13, as originally planned, but in Madrid - more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) away from the Chilean capital of Santiago where they were initially meant to take place.</p>
