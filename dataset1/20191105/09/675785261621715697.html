      <h2>Chelsea continue their Champions League campaign when they take on Ajax on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:12:48+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s young Chelsea team aim to keep their place at the top of Group H as they take on Ajax in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      <p>Despite a 1-0 defeat at home in their opening fixture, Lampard’s men have won back-to-back matches to put <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in a commanding position halfway through the Group Stage.</p>
      <p>They’ve already beaten Ajax in the reverse fixture but last season's semi-finalists are in good goalscoring form having netted eight times in just two matches since Chelsea’s victory in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Michy Batshuayi’s late strike was the difference between the sides two weeks ago after his left-footed effort cannoned in off the bar to send Lampard jubilant on the touchline and give Chelsea all three points.</p>
      <p>Here’s all you need to know ahead of the game...</p>
