      <h3>MORE and more people believe that a concrete plan of action is required to address the worsening problem of teenage pregnancy in the Philippines, particularly in the rural areas.</h3>
      <p>Aware of the situation, two senators now want a Senate inquiry, in aid of legislation, into how to strengthen the comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) and curb teenage pregnancies.</p>
      <p>They are Senators Sherwin “Win” Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate committee on basic education, arts and culture, and Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, head of the Senate committee on finance.</p>
      <p>“Despite the existence of CSE and the Reproductive Health (RH) Law, teenage pregnancy rates in the country are still alarming,” according to Senator “Win” Gatchalian of Valenzuela City.</p>
      <p>Gatchalian said “this prompts us to revisit and strengthen our existing policies so we can save teenagers from getting pregnant and falling into the trap of intergenerational poverty.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Commission on Population and Development (PopCom) called for the declaration of a national emergency on teenage pregnancy in this Asian nation of more than 100 million people.</p>
      <p>PopCom reported that between 2011 and 2017, pregnancies in the 10-14 age group increased by 50 percent from around 1,000 to 2,000 cases, 30-50 of which are among 10-year olds.</p>
      <p>A Philippine Statistics Authority survey also showed that family matters or marriage is the top reason why female out-of-school children and youth aged 6-24 are not attending school.</p>
      <p>Of course, we share the view of various quarters, including members of Congress, that teaching CSE in schools plays a stellar role in curbing teenage pregnancies across the country.</p>
