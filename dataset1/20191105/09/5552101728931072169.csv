由柯佳嬿、許光漢、施柏宇主演的魔幻愛情影集《想見你》，劇情交叉穿越於1998年、2019年的時空，她是她，她也不是她，他是他，他也不是他。柯佳嬿扮演27歲的黃雨萱，靈魂意外穿越住進了1998年17歲高中女生的身體裡，遇到由許光漢主演，與已逝男友長得一樣的高中男生。對於裝嫩回扮高中生，34歲的柯佳嬿說，自己心態上調適得很好，至於外型就只能盡量努力，也透露這應該會是自己最後一次扮演高中生。





施柏宇飾演暗戀柯佳嬿的高中男生，戲中有他黑暗一面的設定。

柯佳嬿、許光漢是新鮮度很高的CP，2人以前沒有合演過，但製作人麻怡婷因為分別與2人合作，發現2個人的節奏與演戲方式頗有共鳴之處，而這個新奇的組合不管是在1998年或是2019年的劇中設定時空，都可以感覺到兩人之間的吸引力，這種時空錯置的題材很吸引柯佳嬿，據說她看了3集劇本後就爽快決定，還問明天就開工嗎？劇中柯佳嬿飾演的高中生陳韻如有個弟弟，是由大鶴林鶴軒扮演，當初在拍戲時大家就嘖嘖稱奇，原來2人竟然長得很像，柯佳嬿搞笑說，拍戲很累的時候，就很想叫大鶴來幫她一下，而施柏宇在戲中的角色則有些驚悚黑暗。


大鶴與柯佳嬿扮演姊弟，2人一比對，也覺得彼此真的長很像。

《想見你》的劇情設定頗為複雜，是編劇簡奇峰在夢中找到的靈感，再與另一名編劇林欣慧，一點一滴把夢中的故事合理化，並完成這個故事，柯佳嬿說自己是「用盡一生的愛」來形容自己這次的演出，說自己很喜歡這個故事，「劇本充滿魔力，所有的情感與角色的建立，都是不知不覺的產生，等回過神，我已經在很深的地方了。」《想見你》11月17日起每週日晚上於中視、23日起每週六於衛視中文台首播。
