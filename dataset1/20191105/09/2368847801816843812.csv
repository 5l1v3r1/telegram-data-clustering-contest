快訊：香港科大生手術失敗命危 家屬趕往醫院

05 Nov 2019, 09:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】香港科技大學一名男學生4日凌晨因躲避催淚彈，失足從停車場3樓摔至2樓，重傷昏迷。5日，該學生已在醫院接受2次手術，但手術失敗，仍處於昏迷中，家屬已趕往醫院。
港媒11月5日報導，受傷的22歲周姓學生目前仍未脫離危險，靠打強心針，以機器維持生命，今天接受了第2次手術，以清除腦部積血。
醫護人員兩次手術中，嘗試以引流術減低其腦壓，均不成功。而且醫生欲為他安裝心塞輔助器，亦告失敗。目前，受傷同學昏迷指數達至最低3分，眼晴對外界刺激並無反應，同時亦對外界說話、疼痛刺激沒有反應。
5日下午，受傷同學的家屬趕往醫院，離開時一言不發，沒有回應守在醫院的傳媒記者。
報導稱，受傷學生腦壓等指數不理想，甦醒機會不大。但其求生意志仍然甚強。目前受傷同學腦部出現瀰漫性缺血，呼吸機能十分微弱，需用強心藥及接駁呼吸機維生。
另外，受傷學生還有盆骨骨折、右邊臀部出現假性血管瘤等情形，需要用外支架固定盆骨，同時施行血管栓塞手術，以控制盆腔出血情況。
據醫護人員估計，該名學生當時可能是右邊臀部先落地，再撞到頭部導致腦出血。
這名受傷的科大學生住在將軍澳尚德邨，4日凌晨，大批港警闖入尚德邨，搜捕示威者，並向停車場發射催淚彈。
現場有消息指，當時有防暴警察在發射催淚後進入停車場1樓及2樓，受傷學生在3樓，他疑似擔心防暴警察會繼續上3樓，加上當時催淚彈煙霧瀰漫，不慎失足由停車場3樓跌至2樓，身體多處受傷流血，當場昏迷。

On the 5th, the student had undergone 2 operations in the hospital, but the operation failed and was still in a coma. The family members had rushed to the hospital.
Hong Kong media reported on November 5 that the injured 22-year-old student of Zhou was still out of danger. He relied on a strong heart to maintain his life with a machine. He received a second operation today to clear the blood in his brain.
During the two operations of the medical staff, attempts to reduce their brain pressure by drainage were unsuccessful. Moreover, the doctor wanted to install a cardiac plug aid for him, and it also failed. At present, the coma index of the injured students has reached a minimum of 3 points. The eye has not responded to external stimuli and has not responded to outside speech and painful stimuli.
On the afternoon of the 5th, the family members of the injured classmates rushed to the hospital. When they left, they said nothing, and did not respond to the media reporters who were in the hospital.
According to the report, the index of brain pressure of injured students is not ideal, and the chance of recovery is not great. But his will to survive is still strong. At present, the injured student's brain has diffuse ischemia, and the ventilatory function is very weak. It needs to be treated with cardiotonic medicine and a ventilator.
In addition, the injured students also have pelvic fractures, pseudo-hemangioma on the right hip, etc., need to use external support to fix the pelvic bone, and at the same time perform vascular embolization surgery to control pelvic bleeding.
According to medical staff estimates, the student may have landed on the right hip at the time, and then hit the head to cause cerebral hemorrhage.
The injured college student lived in Shangde Village, Tseung Kwan O. On the morning of the 4th, a large number of Hong Kong police officers broke into the village of Chandler, searched for demonstrators and fired tear gas into the parking lot.
There was news at the scene that there were riot police who entered the parking lot on the 1st and 2nd floors after launching tears. The injured student was on the 3rd floor. He was suspected that the riot police would continue on the 3rd floor, plus the tear gas smog filled at the time, and the parking lot was accidentally lost. The 3rd floor fell to the 2nd floor, and many bodies were injured and bleed, and they were unconscious on the spot.
