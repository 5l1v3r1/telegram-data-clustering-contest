      <p>Prime Minister Narendra <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/modi">Modi </a>reviewed the air pollution situation in Delhi and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>'Maha' situation in Gujarat with senior officials here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Principal Secretary to Prime Minister PK Mishra and Principal Advisor to Prime Minister PK Sinha were amongst those present in the meeting.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that a few places over Gujarat, Maharashtra, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli are likely to receive rainfall on November 6 and 7 due to the formation of extremely severe cyclonic storm Maha.</p>
      <p>It further said that heavy rainfall, accompanied by winds reaching up to 90 to 100 kmph and tidal waves up to 1.5 metres, are expected in several areas.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, toxic smog in Delhi has engulfed the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital and its adjoining regions post-Diwali with the air quality index (AQI) docking at severe levels, putting the health of people under risk.</p>
      <p>Stubble burning from neighbouring states, coupled with local sources of pollution, has made the air quality worse in Delhi-NCR region.</p>
      <p>A public health emergency has been declared in Delhi and the odd-even road rationing scheme, aimed at tackling pollution, is currently operational from November 4 to November 15.</p>
