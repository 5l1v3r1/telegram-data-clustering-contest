05 Nov 2019, 09:12 by 陳于嬙
張智成推新專輯《你是不是張智成》，首波新歌〈我本來就難搞〉將於11月6日首播，新歌歌名直白，張智成說：「製作人敢寫，我就敢唱阿，我說話直白不迴避，更不怕被貼標籤，對音樂沒得商量，大家感覺我難搞，堅持是初衷的價值，難搞與否，歡迎粉絲可細心體會評價。」
提到音樂，張智成自認超級龜毛，由200首創作曲中細挑出10首作品，總算推出入行20年的第十張專輯。 提到「難搞」，張智成坦言剛出道時，是個好奇寶寶，很愛發問與表達意見，把「為甚麼」掛嘴邊，因此被工作人員冠上「難搞」封號，張智成解釋：「我只是希望把事情做好，因為說話直白，不擅虛假，我的無心總是被曲解，當時我竟天真的想，為何沒人當面告訴我，而總是在背後評論呢？」
