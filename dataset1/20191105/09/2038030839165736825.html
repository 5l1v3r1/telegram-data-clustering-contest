      <p>The 44-year-old was presented with the award by her <i>Bombshell</i> co-star Nicole Kidman, who received the award at last year's ceremony.</p>
      <p>The South African actress was overcome with emotion when Nicole referred to her as one of her heroes.</p>
      <p>During her speech, Charlize said that her role as Aileen Wuornos in the 2003 movie <i>Monster - </i>for which she won an Academy Award <i>-</i>Â was her big life-changing role.</p>
      <p>She also thanked all the directors, writers, producers, actors and studios who took the change on her, reports the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-pacino-renee-zellweger-fate-highlights-acceptance-speeches-at-hollywood-film-awards-1251938"><b>Hollywood Reporter</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"I only have the career I have because so many people in this industry have either mentored me, took me under their wing, showed me kindness and pushed me as far as I could ever go in my career," said Charlize.</p>
