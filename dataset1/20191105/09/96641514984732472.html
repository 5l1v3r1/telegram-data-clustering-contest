      <h1>Netflix signs Sandra Bullock for adaption of British TV series 'Unforgiven'</h1>
      <h2>'Bird Box' was a massive hit, after all.</h2>

      <p>Netflix is <a href="https://twitter.com/seewhatsnext/status/1191448801455693824">working</a> with Sandra Bullock on another feature film -- and likely hoping that the team-up can replicate the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/28/netflix-45-million-accounts-watched-bird-box/">massive success</a> of <i>Bird Box</i>. The actress will star in and produce a movie adaptation of British mini-series <i>Unforgiven</i>, which aired in 2009. It's about a woman trying to rebuild her life and reconnect with the younger sister she was forced to abandon after serving 15 years in prison for the murder of two police officers.</p>

      <p>The movie's script is penned by Christopher McQuarrie (known for writing and directing <i>Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation</i> and <i>M:I -- Fallout)</i> who <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismcquarrie/status/1191456905216045061">started working</a> on the script way back in 2010. Meanwhile, German filmmaker Nora Fingscheidt will helm the project as its director. Netflix's <i>Unforgiven</i> adaptation doesn't have a premiere date yet. It's also unclear if it will start streaming before or after the musical show Bullock is <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/06/11/sandra-bullock-amazon-tv-show/">working on for Amazon</a> that's based on her life in the '80s.</p>
