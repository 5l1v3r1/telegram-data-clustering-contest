          <b>Boardroom fights, clashing egos - How things unravelled for Benni McCarthy at CT City</b>

      </p>
      <p>McCarthy was in charge of the Mother City outfit for almost three seasons, but was shown the door on Monday after the club went through a disastrous spell with two wins from their last 18 games.</p>
      <p>"This is a difficult time for me when it comes to Benni," Comitis revealed to <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/">KickOff</a>. "I don't want to elaborate at this point. It was a tough call."</p>
      <p>Vasili Manousakis, who served as assistant coach under McCarthy, is now in charge of City on an interim basis.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he is targeting a coach from overseas or evaluating local options, Comitis added: "No decisions have been made. We have to consider all our options."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile former Ajax Cape Town head coach Muhsin Ertugral is <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/muhsin-drops-instagram-hint-hes-back-in-cape-town-20191105">being tipped to replace</a> McCarthy as head coach after being spotted in Cape Town.</p>
      <p>Cape Town City find themselves in 13th position in the Absa Premiership standings, but a win over Polokwane City on Wednesday could see them climb up to ninth.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 19:30.</p>
