PSG suffered a shock defeat to Stade Rennais in last season's French Cup final, and the proceedings were marred when Neymar was involved in a post-match altercation with a rival supporter.
After seemingly being taunted by a fan while making his way up some stairs to collect his silver medal, Neymar responded by striking the individual in the face.
The incident was caught on camera and was referred to French criminal prosecutors, who have now revealed what punishment the Brazil international will face for his actions.

According to AFP, the prosecution has decided to issue Neymar with a written warning, and have deemed that no further action is warranted in the circumstances.
The fan's lawyer has since hit out at the decision, claiming that it is unacceptable and justifies the use of violence.
""It's a justification of violence,"" lawyer Philippe Ohayon said.
""If that had been a fan hitting a player, he would have been brought to justice and maybe even received a custodial sentence.""
