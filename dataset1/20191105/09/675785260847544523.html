      <h1>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp instructed to drop "average" Mohamed Salah</h1>
      <h2>Genk are the visitors to Anfield for tonight's Champions League clash - and Jurgen Klopp has been advised to take Mohamed Salah</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> has been urged to drop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah</a> for Tuesday night’s Champions League clash against Genk.</p>
      <p>The Reds can take one step closer to the last-16 stage by beating the Group E whipping boys, but Klopp has hinted he could rotate his squad to cope with their demanding fixture list, which includes Sunday's six-pointer against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> star and Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas believes Salah is one player that should be given a breather after an “average” performance in Saturday’s last-gasp win at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian was substituted midway through the second half at Villa Park as he and Liverpool struggled for fluency.</p>

      <p>“I watched the Liverpool game at the weekend,” Nicholas told <i>Sky Sports</i> . “It was a cracking game and end-to-end with drama too.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool are not at their best. People might suggest that once they get going, they will be ruthless, but they are getting away with it currently.</p>
      <p>“The Napoli and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> matches were reality checks, but they could have been two or three down by the time they rescued things at Aston Villa.</p>

      <p>“Liverpool have a huge amount of games coming up. Mohamed Salah was really average at the weekend, as was Roberto Firmino, so Jurgen Klopp may leave a couple out and change it up.</p>
      <p>“The full-backs will stay the same and you have to leave Sadio Mane in, but Fabinho could also come back in.</p>
      <p>“It is normally Firmino who he rests, but I would leave him in with Mane and leave Salah out. He may not like it but it needs to happen.</p>
      <p>“Divock Origi and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will come in and I think it will be a fairly comfortable night nevertheless for Liverpool.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool secured a 4-1 victory in last month’s reverse fixture in Belgium.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (2), Sadio Mane and Salah all got on the scoresheet.</p>
