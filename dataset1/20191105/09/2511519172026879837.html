      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drones">Drone</a> users in the UK must now pass an online theory test and register as an operator for £9 a year, or face a £1,000 fine.</p>
      <p>Children or adults wanting to fly a drone or unmanned aircraft such as a model plane weighing at least 250g will have to take the test to show they can do so “safely and legally”.</p>
      <p>Those who fail the test or do not register by 30 November will face a fine of up to £1,000 under new regulations from the Civil Aviation Authority (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/caa">CAA</a>).</p>
      <p>Dr Rob Hunter, head of flight safety at airline pilots’ union <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/balpa">Balpa</a>, said encouraging responsible drone use is “desperately needed to ensure a collision between an aircraft and a drone is avoided”.</p>
      <p>He said: “We have been calling for drone registration for some time now as we believe that in the same way that other vehicles – be it those in the air or on the ground – are registered, so should drones.”</p>
      <p>Registrants will be given a unique ID which must be displayed on their devices in a process costing £9 which must be renewed each year.</p>
      <p>The theory test will have 20 multiple choice questions, with applicants needing 16 correct answers to pass. It can be taken as many times as required.</p>
      <p>Drone sightings at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Gatwick">Gatwick</a> in December last year caused around 1,000 flights to be cancelled or diverted over 36 hours, affecting more than 140,000 passengers in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>A number of other airports have been forced to suspend flights for several hours due to drone activity this year, including Heathrow.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/uk-airprox-board">UK Airprox Board</a> figures show there were 125 near-misses between drones and aircraft reported in 2018, up by more than a third from 93 the previous year.</p>
      <p>In March, the drone no-fly zone around airports was extended from 1km (0.6 miles) to 5km (3.1 miles).</p>
      <p>The platform will also be used to help return lost drones to their owners.</p>
      <p>Anyone losing a drone is advised to post their details on the Drones Reunited platform, while anyone who finds one is encouraged to check if it has a registration number and enter the details online.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Nicholson, CAA assistant director of communications, said: “The service is about giving something back to the community, helping responsible drone owners and operators to be reunited with lost drones and continue flying.</p>
      <p>“Our aim is for the Drones Reunited platform to become an essential service for the drone community – the first port of call for anyone who has lost or found a drone.”</p>
