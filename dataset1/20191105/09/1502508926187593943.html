      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on Tuesday asked the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/juvenile-justice">Juvenile Justice </a>Committee of the Jammu High Court to file a fresh report on the alleged detention of minors by the security forces in the region.</p>
      <p>A three-judge bench headed by N V Ramana was hearing a petition filed by child rights activist Enakshi Ganguly who claimed that the children in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>have been illegally detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA) in the wake of the abrogation of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370.</a></p>
      <p>The Centre on August 5 abrogated <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370 </a>of the Indian Constitution in accordance to which the state of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>has now been bifurcated into the Union Territories of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>and Ladakh.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/juvenile-justice">Juvenile Justice </a>Committee had submitted a report to the apex court claiming that "144 juveniles, including children aged nine and 11, were arrested since August 5 after the abrogation of Article 370".</p>
      <p>The committee, however, submitted that no child is under illegal detention in the valley.</p>
