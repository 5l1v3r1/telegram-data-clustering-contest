巴格達迪姐姐被活捉 軍方獲ISIS機密恐怖組織伊斯蘭國（ISIS）原頭目巴格達迪在美軍突襲中自殺後，他的姐姐拉斯米亞．阿瓦德日前被土耳其政府活捉。一名土耳其高級官員稱，阿瓦德就像一個「情報寳藏」，將從她身上挖出更多ISIS內部機密情報。

猝死重慶副書記傳與陳敏爾不睦 學者:疑反習勢力被整肅重慶市委副書記任學鋒在四中全會閉幕日突然死亡。中共官方在其已去世3天後，才在深夜對外發佈消息，稱其近日因病醫治無效死亡，引發外界質疑。有消息指任某系跳樓身亡，而多個信息源指其或因捲入體制內的路線鬥爭而被清除。
胡耀邦去世前 女兒感知到神秘第六感心理學家認為，所謂「第六感」是人體一種瞬間而直接的預知。據統計，在第六感方面，女性的正確率普遍要大於男性。胡耀邦的女兒在回憶錄中提到父親去世前，她感知到神秘的第六感，「它實在太神秘，神秘得連它的存在都變得可疑。但我確確實實地感知到了。」

鄭中原：習近平急赴上海 變相宣示接班人 要動江澤民侄？中共十九屆四中全會剛落幕，習近平隔天就跑到上海，還到了楊浦區。除了準備出席下星期在當地舉辦的第二屆國際進口博覽會的開幕儀式，還事涉接班人動向，以及四中全會前一樁未及處理的官場大醜聞，或因觸動層級太高，習近平要親自出馬。

中共首次宣布「公安姓黨」 「黨衛隊」呼之欲出中共19屆四中全會再次強化「黨管一切」，以維護中共岌岌可危的統治。隨後，公安部部長趙克志即宣布「公安姓黨」，要保衞所謂「社會主義制度安全」。評論人士指，這等於直接宣誓公安是「黨衛隊」。

中共恐嚇東盟挨批 華為欲挾東南亞抗美圍堵第35屆東盟峰會及東亞峰會週一在泰國曼谷閉幕。白宮國家安全顧問在會上批評，北京威嚇阻止東盟國家開發南海資源。華為公司則在峰會上稱為在東南亞鋪設5G做好準備，被指意圖對抗美國圍堵。
彭博：習近平對赴美簽協議持開放態度智利宣布取消主辦APEC峰會後，美中兩國首腦將在何處簽署首階段貿易協議頓成懸疑。彭博社日前引述知情人士稱，中國國家主席習近平對赴美持開放態度。週一，中共外交部發言人在記者會上被問及「川習會」可能的地點時卻未給予正面回答，僅稱兩位領導人一直保持聯繫。

[Wonderful recommendation] The Fourth Plenary Session will kill people.

05 Nov 2019, 09:28

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 05, 2019] NTDTV recommends daily wonderful articles and video programs for readers:
The Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, which was shortly after the death of two of the five people, did not show any change in personnel. However, the media found that during the plenary session, people were killed. Two of the five people who were absent from the Fourth Plenary Session died bizarrely, including Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
Sister Baghdadi was taken alive. The military was sued by the ISIS secret terrorist organization ISIS, the original leader of the Islamic State (ISIS), after his suicide in the US military raid, his sister Rasmiah. Awad was captured by the Turkish government a few days ago. A senior Turkish official said that Awad is like an ""intelligence treasure"" that will dig up more confidential ISIS information from her.

Wang Shoucheng, former deputy director of the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau of Hebei Province, was tried by four counts of suspected huge sources of property. The case was not pronounced in court. Its family property exceeds 100 million yuan, of which more than 50 million sources are unknown. Wang Shoucheng is also involved in the crime of persecution of human rights.
Sudden death of Chongqing deputy secretary and Chen Miner is not a scholar Scholar: suspected anti-study forces were purged Chongqing Municipal Party Committee deputy secretary Ren Xuefeng suddenly died on the closing day of the Fourth Plenary Session. The CCP official released a message in the middle of the night three days after his death, saying that he died of illness and treatment in recent days, causing outside doubts. There is news that any department has jumped to the building and that multiple sources of information have been removed from the route of involvement in the system.
Before Hu Yaobang's death, her daughter perceives the mysterious sixth sense. Psychologists believe that the so-called ""sixth sense"" is a momentary and direct prediction of the human body. According to statistics, in terms of the sixth sense, the correct rate of women is generally greater than that of men. Hu Yaobang’s daughter mentioned in her memoirs that before her father’s death, she perceives the mysterious sixth sense. “It’s too mysterious, mysterious and even its existence has become suspicious. But I did feel it.”
Jiang Zemin ordered to share mistresses? Counting Zhongnanhai's nine kinky villains Since the ruling of Jiang Zemin's corruption, China's social morality has fallen sharply, and official pornography has been rampant. A few days ago, the media turned out the scandals of the nine gangsters in Zhongnanhai. These gangsters were from the deputy to the national level. Most of them were hard-hearted cronies directly cultivated by Jiang Zemin, and even more ridiculous was the plan of one of Jiang’s and the sluts. Share mistress.
The face of the training of Lin Zheng ""the most important task"" The Minister of Public Security followed the speculation that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party did not ease the situation in Hong Kong. On the contrary, it was even more severe. The Hong Kong Police set a new record of more than 200 people. On the 4th of November, Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue went to Shanghai to report to Xi Jinping. Xi’s face-to-face interview with Lin Zheng was the most important task. When the two met, Zhao Kezhi, the Minister of Public Security of the Communist Party of China, accompanied him and triggered speculation.
Chuan Ren Xuefeng was involved in the talks about P2P. From the Jingxi Hotel, he died from the death of the building. The 54-year-old deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ren Xuefeng, suddenly passed away, and suicide rumors flew. According to the net report, Ren Xuefeng died in Beijing on October 31. There is also news that Ren Xuefeng went to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party and was interviewed. On the closing day of the Fourth Middle School, he jumped at the Jingxi Hotel.
The mainland people ""Dai Yu dance"" to avoid censorship Chen Qiushi: To smash the CCP's political remarks, the intensity of the review has become more and more serious, and there has been a kind of coping style in the mainland. After the Beijing lawyer Chen Qiushi, who had broadcasted the Hong Kong ""Reverse Sending"" campaign, was banned by the official website of the Chinese Communist Party, there were fans in the video to help Chen Qiu real put an expression pack on his face and spread it. However, Chen Qiushi expressed his understanding, but he should consider how to break it.
Zheng Zhongyuan: Xi Jinping rushed to Shanghai to disguise his successor to move Jiang Zemin? The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee just ended. Xi Jinping ran to Shanghai the next day and went to Yangpu District. In addition to preparing to attend the opening ceremony of the second International Import Expo held in the local area next week, it is also about the succession of the successors, as well as an unsuccessful official scandal before the Fourth Plenary Session, or because the level of the touch is too high, Xi Jinping wants Go out in person.
National monitoring and upgrading of the CCP to test ""emotional recognition"" technology in Xinjiang Recently, the CCP used the newly developed emotional identification technology to analyze the emotional and psychological state of pedestrians in public places such as airports in Xinjiang on the grounds of crime prevention. Public opinion is wrong. Experts and scholars pointed out that emotion recognition is not a new technology, but China is the first country to openly use this technology widely in society. The government's use of electronic high-tech to comprehensively monitor the public is equivalent to wearing an electronic surveillance foot ring for all Chinese, essentially treating everyone as a criminal or suspect.
For the first time, the CCP announced that the ""Public Security Bureau"" and the ""Party Guards"" came to the fore. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee once again strengthened the ""party-management"" to safeguard the precarious rule of the CCP. Subsequently, the Minister of Public Security, Zhao Kezhi, announced that the ""Public Security Names Party"" should defend the so-called ""social system security."" Commentators said that this is tantamount to directly swearing that the public security is the ""party guard.""

Bloomberg: Xi Jinping is open to the signing of the agreement to the United States After Chile announced the cancellation of the APEC summit, the US and China leaders will sign the first phase of the trade agreement. Bloomberg recently quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that Chinese President Xi Jinping is open to the United States.

Three people returned to the mainland and uploaded a video of the Hong Kong police on Weibo. They were taken as ""heroes"" by mainland netizens who did not know the truth.
