      <h1>Mesut Ozil used to "love ladies" and knew "how to fire it" at a nightclub</h1>
      <h2>Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner says he took Mesut Ozil out clubbing three times in his first week at the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:15:03+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Mesut Ozil loves nightclubs and could not wait to get into the party scene as soon as he arrived in London.</p>
      <p>That is the claim from ex-Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner who describes himself as a "concierge" for his former team mates in his explosive new book.</p>
      <p>Bendtner says he took Ozil out into London THREE times in his first week after he arrived at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in 2013 despite the former Germany international angrily denying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> sold him because he went out partying too much.</p>
      <p>Ozil, 31, is now married to former Miss Turkey Amine Gulse but Bendtner says he "loved ladies" and knew "how to fire it" on a night out.</p>

      <p>Danish international Bendtner, in his new book Both Sides which is out Tuesday, writes: "The squad does not resemble itself anymore. Robin van Persie has been sold off in the offensive and has come in two Frenchmen, Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo.</p>
      <p>"The Germans Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil have also joined. Ozil is a game distributor and should have been at odds with Real Madrid because he was partying too much. He denies that, of course, stubbornly, also in the media.</p>
      <p>"On his second day at Arsenal, he visits me for training. 'I hear you're the go-to guy if you want to look around in the nightlife?' 'It's not entirely wrong,' I reply.</p>

      <p>"Without going into detail you can safely say that there is something about the talk. Ozil is a bachelor, and during his first week in London we take the trip three times.</p>
      <p>"He does not act crazy or particularly demanding when he is out, but he knows how to fire it. And like so many others, he loves ladies. No doubt about it.</p>
      <p>"Many people describe the guy as a bit arrogant, but that's not my experience. He is just quiet by nature and it can confuse people. That he holds both sides. I caught it. There are always two sides. Least.</p>

      <p>"Now Ozil is not to be wandered than he is. There are so many who make use of my local knowledge. I almost become a kind of concierge for my teammates.</p>
      <p>"If they can't get a table at a restaurant, I'll call and get a few extra chairs. If they want to be on the guest list for a club with strict membership requirements, I'll call and make it happen."</p>
