Swanky Dubai nightclub Cavalli has revealed a brand-new Robot Bar as part of its tenth anniversary celebrations.Cavalli’s new bar is the first in the region and has advanced robotic arms to craft mixed drinks with “extreme precision”.The Robot Bar can make up to 60 mixed drinks in an hour.The process is simple, you pay for the drink at the bar and receive a voucher, you input what drink you want on iPads, confirm the ticket number and the robot starts making your drink.A screen at the back shows you when your drink will be made – saying farewell to trying to get the bar staff’s attention.The robot then thoroughly cleans the shaker after every drink.The new bar is all part of a massive revamp of the Sheikh Zayed Road club. Earlier this year the bar revealed a swish new look – with 700,000 Swarovski crystals, Dhs1million in gold fixtures, 12m long hydraulic-lift catwalk and a -18 degrees Celsius ice bar.The multi-million dollar renovation of the mega-club was designed by famous Italian architect Italo Rota and is plastered in a new animal pattern of Italian designer Robert Cavalli.Fancy something super high-tech? You know where to go.Open daily 8.30pm-3am. Fairmont Hotel, Sheikh Zayed Road (050 991 0400).
