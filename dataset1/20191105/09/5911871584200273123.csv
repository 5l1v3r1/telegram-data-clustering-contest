Best Coast – “For The First Time” Video
05 Nov 2019, 09:32 by Tom Breihan
Best Coast back, baby! The fuzzy good-vibes Southern California duo haven’t exactly been silent lately. They’ve had things going on, like a kids’ song and a run as the house band on a Fred Savage TV show. But Best Coast haven’t released an album since they dropped California Nights four and a half years ago. So it’s cool to learn that they’ll be back with a follow-up pretty soon.
Best Coast haven’t yet unveiled the details on the forthcoming LP Always Tomorrow, which, according to Brooklyn Vegan, is coming early next year. But they do have a new single. And they’ve also announced a big tour with Mannequin Pussy, which will take them across North America next year and which sounds like a fascinating double bill.
“For The First Time” is a clean, triumphant tune about moving on from self-destruction and sadness. And Bethany Cosentino really sings the hell out of it. She’s on her Neko Case shit here. In director Kevin Hayes’ video, Cosentino and her bandmate Bobb Bruno spend time bumming around various California environs — a clean and empty house, a burger joint, a mostly-empty mall. It ends in a joyous karaoke party. Below, you can watch the video and check out the dates for the tour with Mannequin Pussy.
