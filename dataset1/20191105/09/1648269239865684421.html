      <p>The outside of the customized truck looks more aggressive thanks to a sports bar on the sides of the bed and over the roof. It also has a set of off-road lights to illuminate the way ahead when the sun sets in the wilderness. There are also marker lights on the fenders and grille. Front and rear mud flaps add a rugged aesthetic. </p>
      <p>At the back, there's a sliding bed extender, and owners can secure gear with tie-down cleats. A rear bumper step and assist handle make it easier to access cargo. There's a Class III four-inch drop hitch ball mount for towing.</p>
