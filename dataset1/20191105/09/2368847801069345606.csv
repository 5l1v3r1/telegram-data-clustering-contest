前中共公安局副局長家產上億元 涉迫害人權罪

05 Nov 2019, 09:19

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】中共河北省張家口公安局前副局長王守成，日前，被以涉嫌巨額財產來源不明等四宗罪受審，案件未當庭宣判。其家產超過1億元人民幣，其中5千多萬來源不明。王守成還涉迫害人權罪。
大陸媒體11月4日獲得的起訴書披露了，張家口公安局前副局長王守成犯四宗罪的犯罪細節。
9月24日至27日，王守成涉嫌受賄罪、貪污罪、濫用職權罪、巨額財產來源不明罪，在張家口市橋東區法院開庭審理；同日，王守成之妻、前張家口市公安局交通警察支隊宣化大隊車管所所長張昭，涉嫌受賄罪開庭審理，案件未當庭宣判。
王守成在中共張家口公安系統任職10多年。2006年至2018年歷任宣化縣公安局政委、宣化縣公安局長、宣化區公安分局局長、張家口市公安局黨委委員、副局長。
去年7月27日，王守成落馬，被控在2006年至2018年期間，利用擔任的多個職務的便利，為宣化區黑惡勢力充當「保護傘」，故意包庇黑惡勢力成員；索要財物折合人民幣2059萬餘元；濫用職權，非法設立「小金庫」，侵吞公共財物共計335萬餘元。
王守成所保護的黑惡勢力團伙之一，是以張家口市宣化區巨鑫商務酒店股東郭某某為首的惡勢力團伙，其在宣化開設多家賓館洗浴場所，長期組織賣淫活動，在多處娛樂場所開設賭場，獲取暴利。
同時，王守成還以其女兒王某某出國留學需要保證金，以及其妻子張昭購買蟲草粉、燕窩等補品及在不同城市買房為由受賄及索賄。
王守成將贓款用於在不同城市購買多套房產，包括位於北京市朝陽區林萃東路1號院某室的房產（北京「鳥巢」附近），位於「鳥巢」附近比較高端的小區，每套房子的業主報價基本在2000萬元左右。
王守成家庭擁有的財產總額折合人民幣超過1億77萬元，其中房產占1881餘萬元。
檢方稱，其中有5521餘萬元財產不能說明來源，超過其合法收入，差額特別巨大。
此外，王守成還涉迫害人權罪。據明慧網報導，王守成從擔任宣化公安分局副局長，及升任宣化區公安分局局長後，對當地法輪功學員的迫害更加嚴重。
當地遭綁架或判刑及被非法勞教的法輪功學員達數十人。王守成因此被海外「追查迫害法輪功的國際組織」追查，指控他是迫害法輪功學員張新華和賈鵬飛的責任人之一。
近年來，中共公檢法系統官員，因迫害無辜善良民眾惡運連連。
去年11月初，中共官方網站公開通報，中共十八大以來，至少有130餘個中共公安正、副局長相繼落馬。同時還有至少有60多個中共政法委正、副書記相繼落馬。
另外，截至2018年12月12日，還有455名各級政法委書記厄運纏身，其中死亡的有143人，患重病、癌症的59人，傷殘的19人，被查處的145人等。
去年4月中旬到5月中旬短短一個月的時間內，分別有6名檢察長和6名法院院長相繼落馬。
這些中共公檢法系統官員都有一個共同的特點：直接、積極地指揮實施了對法輪功學員的迫害，並被海外明慧網曝光。
1999年以來，中共對法輪功學員發動了慘絕人寰的迫害，中共公安、政法系統淪為江澤民集團的打手，致使成千上萬的法輪功學員被非法抓捕、關押、洗腦、構陷、庭審、判刑，甚至酷刑致死。
這些公檢法系統官員撤職落馬的原因，表面上是貪腐在政治鬥爭中被剔除，實際是因迫害法輪功遭到報應。

The former deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of the Communist Party of China has a family property of over 100 million yuan.

05 Nov 2019, 09:19

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Wang Shoucheng, former deputy director of the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau of Hebei Province, was tried by four counts of suspected huge sources of property. The case was not pronounced in court. Its family property exceeds 100 million yuan, of which more than 50 million sources are unknown. Wang Shoucheng is also involved in the crime of persecution of human rights.
The indictment obtained by the mainland media on November 4 disclosed the details of the crimes committed by Wang Shoucheng, former deputy director of the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau, in committing four crimes.
From September 24th to 27th, Wang Shoucheng was suspected of accepting bribes, corruption, abuse of power, and the crime of unclear source of property. He was tried in the Qiaodong District Court of Zhangjiakou City. On the same day, Wang Shoucheng’s wife and former Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau Traffic Police Detachment Zhang Zhao, director of the Xuanhua Brigade Vehicle Management Office, was suspected of accepting bribes for trial, and the case was not pronounced in court.
Wang Shoucheng has served in the Zhangjiakou Public Security System of the Communist Party for more than 10 years. From 2006 to 2018, he served as political commissar of Xuanhua County Public Security Bureau, director of Public Security Bureau of Xuanhua County, director of Public Security Bureau of Xuanhua District, member of the Party Committee of Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau, and deputy director.
On July 27 last year, Wang Shoucheng was dismissed and was accused of using the convenience of multiple positions during the period from 2006 to 2018 to act as a ""protective umbrella"" for the evil forces in Xuanhua District, deliberately sheltering members of the evil forces; RMB 25.59 million yuan; abuse of power, illegally set up a ""small treasury"", and embezzled public goods totaling a total of 3.35 million yuan.
One of the black and evil gangs protected by Wang Shoucheng is an evil gang headed by Guo Moumou, a shareholder of Juxin Business Hotel in Xuanhua District, Zhangjiakou City. It has opened a number of hotel bathing places in Xuanhua and has long organized prostitution activities in various places. Open casinos in entertainment venues for huge profits.
At the same time, Wang Shoucheng also took bribes and asked for bribes on the grounds that his daughter Wang Moumou needed to study abroad and his wife Zhang Zhao purchased tonics, bird's nest and other supplements and bought houses in different cities.
Wang Shoucheng will use the money to purchase multiple properties in different cities, including a property located in a certain room of No. 1 Lin Cui East Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing (near Beijing ""Bird's Nest""), located in a relatively high-end neighborhood near the ""Bird's Nest"". The owner's offer for the house is basically around 20 million yuan.
The total amount of property owned by Wang Shoucheng's family is equivalent to more than RMB 107,700, of which the property accounts for more than 18.81 million yuan.
The prosecution claimed that more than 55.21 million yuan of property could not explain the source, exceeding its legal income, and the difference was extremely large.
In addition, Wang Shoucheng is also involved in the crime of persecution of human rights. According to Minghui.com, Wang Shoucheng’s persecution of local Falun Gong practitioners was even more serious after he served as deputy director of the Xuanhua Public Security Bureau and was promoted to the director of the Xuanhua District Public Security Bureau.
There are dozens of Falun Gong practitioners who have been abducted or sentenced and illegally re-educated. Wang Shoucheng was therefore pursued by overseas ""international organizations that pursued persecution of Falun Gong"" and accused him of being one of the responsible persons of Zhang Xinhua and Jia Pengfei who persecuted Falun Gong practitioners.
In recent years, officials of the CCP's public security law system have been ruined by innocent and good people.
At the beginning of November last year, the official website of the Chinese Communist Party publicly announced that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, at least 130 CCP public security deputies and deputy directors have been dismissed. At the same time, at least 60 of the CCP’s political and legal committee members and deputy secretaries have been dismissed.
In addition, as of December 12, 2018, there were 455 political and legal committee secretaries at all levels, including 143 people who died, 59 people with serious illness and cancer, 19 people with disabilities, and 145 people who were investigated.
In the short period of one month from mid-April to mid-May last year, six prosecutors and six court presidents were successively dismissed.
These CCP public security system officials have a common feature: direct and active command and implementation of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, and was exposed by overseas Minghui.
Since 1999, the CCP has launched a terrible persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The CCP’s public security and political and legal systems have become the thugs of the Jiang Zemin Group, causing thousands of Falun Gong practitioners to be illegally arrested, detained, brainwashed, trapped, courted, sentenced, and even Torture kills.
The reason for the dismissal of these public security system officials was that corruption was removed from the political struggle. Actually, the persecution of Falun Gong was retribution.
