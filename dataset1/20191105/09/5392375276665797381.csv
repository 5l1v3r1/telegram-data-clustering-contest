Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro



In terms of photography, the Mi CC9 Pro achieves 130 points (Mate 30 Pro scored 132 points), delivering good results in all situations. According to DxOmark, it preserves the details very well and can greatly avoid noise in the images.
The portraits will be at a good level, and the white balance as well. Night photography offers natural tones, but we are talking about a device that also has flaws. Such as the loss of sharpness towards the edges of images with a high dynamic range.
Zoom is the big photographic highlight



Its native 2x zoom and 4x optical gives it a score of 109 points in this field. While in the video tests, it reaches 102 points, which is the highest number so far on the platform.
The actual use is what will really determine this quality. No matter how high the score is, you should wait for the first user reviews. To see if this is really the device that will make you dispense from professional cameras.
