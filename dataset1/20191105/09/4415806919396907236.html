      <h1>Nine-storey hotel approved for Clerys site in Dublin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:06:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A nine-storey hotel, with more than 200 bedrooms, has been approved for the Clerys site in Dublin.</p>
      <p>An extra two floors have been added to the development at a former warehouse on Earl Place just off O'Connell Street.</p>
      <p>Shops, offices and a rooftop restaurant are also planned at the former department store.</p>
      <p>Richard Guiney, CEO of business group Dublin Town, said: "There is a shortage of hotel space in the city and particularly in the area that this is going to be O'Connell Street</p>
      <p>"That's been effectively vacant for quite some time and I think the whole north side can certainly benefit from it.</p>
      <p>"It is in the very heart of the city. It's where tourists want to be."</p>
