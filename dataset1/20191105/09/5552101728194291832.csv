蘋果投資首部電影長片　神盾局長聯手獵鷹再出擊
05 Nov 2019, 09:06 by 娛樂組
今年《復仇者聯盟：終局之戰》發了鋼鐵人便當，加上《蜘蛛人：離家日》揭曉原來神盾局長並不在地球上，讓人好奇到底漫威之後會怎麼處理神盾局長。但在答案揭曉前，Apple TV+投資的《幕後大亨》搶先撮合了神盾局長與獵鷹，這也是蘋果投資的首部電影長片。



由山繆傑克森與安東尼麥基合作的《幕後大亨》（The Banker）改編真人真事，故事背景在種族歧視的60年代，為了躲過白人設下種種不公平的限制，黑人伯納（Bernard Garrett）與喬（Joe）想出了大膽的計畫，就是找個白人來假扮老闆，但實際上他們才是這間公司的主人。
在這個前提下，他們找到了麥特，假扮一位房地產兼銀行大亨，伯納與喬則假扮他的清潔工與司機。他們就這樣一搭一唱，貸款給其他需要資金的黑人創業。
《幕後大亨》會先在12月6日在美國於戲院上映，到明年1月才會在Apple TV+上架。有鑑於過去幾年奧斯卡對於種族隔離題材、又是改編真人真事的偏愛，像是《關鍵少數》《幸福綠皮書》都得到很好的迴響，《幕後大亨》也頗有希望在得獎季節闖出名號。說不定蘋果會比Netflix更快拿下奧斯卡。

Apple invests in the first film feature film, the Aegis Secretary teamed up with the Falcon and attacked again.
05 Nov 2019, 09:06 by Entertainment Group
This year, ""Avengers: The Final Battle"" issued a steel man's lunch, and ""Spider Man: Leave Home"" revealed that the original Aegis director is not on the earth, making people wonder how the Aegis will be dealt with after the Marvel. But before the answer was announced, Apple TV+ invested in ""behind the scenes"" to pre-empt the Aegis director and Falcon, which is Apple's first film feature.



The Banker, co-operated by Hawthorn Jackson and Anthony McGee, adapted real people. The story is in the 1960s of racism. In order to escape the unfair restrictions of whites, Black Bernard (Bernard) Garrett and Joe came up with a bold plan to find a white man to pretend to be the boss, but in reality they are the owners of the company.
Under this premise, they found Matt, posing as a real estate and bank tycoon, Bernard and Joe pretending to be his cleaners and drivers. They sang like this and loaned to other black entrepreneurs who need funds.
""The Behind the Scenes"" will be released in the theater on December 6th in the United States, and will not be available on Apple TV+ until January next year. In view of the past few years, Oscar’s preference for apartheid and adaptation of real people’s realities, such as “Key Minority” and “Happy Green Book” have been well echoed. “The Behind the Scenes” is also quite promising in winning the prize. The season is famous. Maybe Apple will win an Oscar faster than Netflix.
