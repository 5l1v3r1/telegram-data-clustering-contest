      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/harry_styles">Harry Styles</a> has announced that he will release a new <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/album">album</a> by the end of the year.</p>
      <p><i>Fine Line</i>, the former One Direction member’s second solo album, will be released on 13 December.</p>
      <p>Styles made the announcement on Monday via social media.</p>
      <p>He also shared the album’s artwork, a photo taken by the English fashion photographer Tim Walker, which shows Styles posing in a fuchsia shirt tucked into high-waisted, white trousers.</p>
      <p>Styles’s first solo effort, <i>Harry Styles</i>, came out in May 2017.</p>
      <p>Fans have long awaited his new release, and rumours of a second solo album ramped up last month. He recently hinted that his new album <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/harry-styles-little-mermaid-prince-eric-reject-role-a9183981.html">is the reason he turned down the role of Prince Eric in the forthcoming Disney remake of </a><i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/harry-styles-little-mermaid-prince-eric-reject-role-a9183981.html">The Little Mermaid.</a> </i></p>
      <p>The singer released a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/harry-styles-lights-up-review-song-lyrics-video-album-release-date-a9151816.html">new single titled “Lights Up”</a> in October this year.</p>
      <p>Styles is scheduled to appear on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/snl-harry-styles-host-guest-episode-when-a9169856.html"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a> as both host and musical guest on 16 November.</p>
      <p>On the occasion, he will join the prestigious list of artists who have received the honour of a double billing on the sketch show, which includes Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.</p>
