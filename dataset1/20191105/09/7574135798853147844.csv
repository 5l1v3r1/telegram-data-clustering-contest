The first-ever NYC edition of Lethal Amounts’ LA party Sex Cells went down at Brooklyn Bazaar on Friday (11/1), featuring Hercules and Love Affair, Amanda Lepore, Katie Rex, Blu Anxxiety, Matthew Pernicano, Nikki Sneakers, and most exciting of all, Soft Cell singer Marc Almond performing Soft Cell songs. It followed Soft Cell regrouping in 2018 to play their first show in 14 years and last ever, and it was Marc’s first time performing Soft Cell material in NYC in a long time.
He didn’t only play Soft Cell songs — he also played Marc and the Mambas songs and solo material — but he did load his set with Soft Cell classics like “Memorabilia,” “Loving You, Hating Me,” “Fun City,” “Chips On My Shoulder,” “Sex Dwarf,” “Say Hello, Wave Goodbye,” “Heat,” “Numbers,” “L’esqualita,” and of course, “Tainted Love / Where Did Our Love Go.” Pictures are in the gallery above. Videos and Marc’s full setlist are below.
The show was one of the last-ever at Brooklyn Bazaar, which closes later this month.
