      <p>The art of photography doesn’t stop once you hit the shutter button. Much of the creative process happens later, when you edit your images.

      <p>Many photo editors offer an “Auto” option. This is great for beginners and more advanced photographers looking for a quick fix. However, you lose all creative control. With Luminar 3, you retain control without having to push every slider yourself.</p>
      <p>The software has a feature called Accent AI 2.0. This combines multiple adjustments into a single slider, meaning you only have to worry about the strength of the effect. For instance, you can enhance skies and add punch to RAW files this way. </p>
      <p>In addition, Luminar 3 provides 70 one-click styles designed by pro photographers — ideal for making your images stand out. If you prefer taking manual control, you have a full complement of individual adjustments, brushes and tools to work with.</p>
