      <h1>Sister of Slain Terrorist Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi 'Captured by Turkey'</h1>
      <h2>Turkey captured the elder sister of the slain leader of the Islamic State terrorist group in a northwestern Syria trailer park on Monday, according to a senior Turkish official, who called the arrest the first step in an intelligence “gold mine.”</h2>

      <p>The 65-year-old, named as Rasmiya Awad, was detained in a raid near the town of Azaz, officials said. Turkish officials, cited by <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/intelligence-gold-mine-sister-of-killed-is-leader-is-captured-alive-in-syria-11854418">several</a> media outlets, are confident the arrest could yield valuable intelligence about Islamic State and its operations.</p>
      <p>The official said the sister was with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children. The adults are being interrogated, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol.</p>
      <p>One Turkish official <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-turkey/turkey-captures-sister-of-dead-is-leader-in-syria-turkish-officials-idUKKBN1XE2CX">told</a> Reuters news agency the arrest of Baghdadi’s older sister may help shed light on “the inner workings” of Islamic State.</p>
      <p>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/27/donald-trump-confirms-death-of-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi/">killed</a> during a raid by U.S. special forces on his compound in north-west Syria last month.</p>
      <p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s communications director said the woman’s capture was evidence of Turkey’s determination to fight against Islamic State.</p>
      <p>“The arrest of al-Baghdadi’s sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations,” Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter early on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh,” he wrote, using another name for Islamic State.</p>
      <p>“Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned.”</p>
