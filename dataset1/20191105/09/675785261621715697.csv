Chelsea continue their Champions League campaign when they take on Ajax on Tuesday night
05 Nov 2019, 09:12 by Sam Fletcher
Frank Lampard’s young Chelsea team aim to keep their place at the top of Group H as they take on Ajax in the UEFA Champions League.
Despite a 1-0 defeat at home in their opening fixture, Lampard’s men have won back-to-back matches to put Chelsea in a commanding position halfway through the Group Stage.
They’ve already beaten Ajax in the reverse fixture but last season's semi-finalists are in good goalscoring form having netted eight times in just two matches since Chelsea’s victory in Amsterdam.
Michy Batshuayi’s late strike was the difference between the sides two weeks ago after his left-footed effort cannoned in off the bar to send Lampard jubilant on the touchline and give Chelsea all three points.
Here’s all you need to know ahead of the game...
