      <h1>'Almost perfect' - Former West Brom ace delivers verdict on Albion's promotion prospects</h1>
      <h2>The Baggies moved back to the top of the Sky Bet Championship table last night with a 2-0 victory at Stoke City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:55:29+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>Don Goodman believes his old club West Bromwich Albion will take some stopping in the Sky Bet Championship this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> returned to the top of the table last night courtesy of a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-move-back-top-17200800">2-0 victory at rock bottom Stoke City</a> .</p>
      <p>Matt Phillips gave <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/greedy-what-slaven-bilic-said-17200851">Slaven Bilic</a> 's men an early lead, and substitute Hal Robson-Kanu added a second from the penalty spot after the break.</p>
      <p>The result took the Baggies two points clear of closest challengers Preston North End, Leeds United and Swansea City - with almost a third of the campaign gone.</p>

      <p>Goodman, who scored 63 goals in 181 appearances for West Brom between 1987 and 1991, was co-commentator for the Stoke game on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>Asked if he thought his former team would take some stopping now, the 53-year-old replied: "Well, yes.</p>
      <p>"You would suggest that anyone that finishes above them would be automatically promoted, you really would.</p>
      <p>"(It was) an outstanding, almost perfect away display (against Stoke).</p>

      <p>"They defended well and got a clean sheet, which will be very pleasing for Slaven Bilic.</p>
      <p>"They're back on top."</p>
      <p>Albion - unbeaten in five games since suffering their solitary league defeat this term at Leeds - are back in action on Saturday when they visit Hull City.</p>
