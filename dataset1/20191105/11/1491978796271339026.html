      <p>In a statement issued to the Evening Standard, the leader of the House of Commons, said: 'I profoundly apologise. What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade's advice to stay and wait at the time. However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn't and I don't think anyone else would'</p>
