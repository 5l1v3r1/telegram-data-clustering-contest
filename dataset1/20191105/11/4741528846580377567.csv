Dangote Sugar Refinery (DSR) has announced its intention to merge with its subsidiary, Savannah Sugar Company Limited (SSCL).
The Details: In a notice sent to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and the general investing public, the board of directors recommended that the business combination would occur through a scheme of external restructuring which would then result in the merger.
The scheme recommended a transfer of all assets, liabilities and undertakings of Savannah Sugar to Dangote Sugar. It also recommended the cancellation of the entire issued share capital of Savannah Sugar to produce Dangote Sugar Refinery as the surviving entity.
