      <h1>Fortnite Pro Banned for Life for Using Aimbot</h1>

      <p>Despite their prevalence in some corners of the internet, I feel like it should come as no surprise that if you make use of cheats in a competitive multiplayer game, you run the risk of getting banned. Unfortunately for Faze clan <i>Fortnite</i> player Jarvis, that nugget of information appeared to pass him by, and now Epic’s banned him for life.</p>
      <p>In a video posted last night, Jarvis uploaded a video titled “I’ve been banned from Fortnite (I’m Sorry),” in which he expressed the extent to which the battle royale had changed his life before telling fans that “I’ve actually been banned on fortnite for life.”</p>

      <p>“Recently, I’ve posted some videos of me using aimbot in solos and playground mode. All I was thinking about while I was making those videos was just how entertaining and interesting those videos would be for you guys to watch. It didn’t even cross my mind that I could be banned for life on <i>Fortnite</i>.”</p>
      <p>Sadly, that was a thought that Epic definitely had - the company told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20948032/fortnite-faze-jarvis-banned-aimhack-cheating">Polygon</a> that “we have a zero tolerance policy for the usage of cheat software.” While that’s fair enough, Jarvis’ punishment is one of the most high-profile permabans the developer has handed down so far - and the community has been quick to point out that fellow pros XXiF and Ronaldo, who cheated during the qualifying rounds of the <i>Fortnite</i> World Cup, were only banned for two weeks.</p>
      <p>As apology videos go, Jarvis’ seems relatively heartfelt. He says that “I’m going to take accountability for my actions and I understand why this has happened. I just wish I had known how severe the consequences were at the time and I would have never thought about doing it.”</p>
