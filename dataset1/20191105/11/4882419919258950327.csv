The curious case surrounding Gareth Bale's fitness has taken a fresh turn today. After picking up an injury in the final match with Wales, an injury which has seen him miss every match for Real Madrid since, he's now been named in Wales' new squad.
Bale hasn't featured for Madrid since the 5th October (vs Granada). After playing against Slovakia and Croatia, the winger complained about discomfort in his calf. Although surprisingly there was no official report released by the club detailing the extent of his problem.
Wales need their talisman for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers and as such Ryan Giggs has named Bale in his initial squad list.
No doubt the decision to call up Bale will spark questions from the media when Giggs holds a press conference. It'll be interesting to see how Madrid react should Bale be declared fit for the contests with his national team.
