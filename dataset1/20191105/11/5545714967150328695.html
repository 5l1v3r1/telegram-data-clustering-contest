      <p>PlayStation has released a celebration of its wares with a fun new commercial that features many iconic video game characters invading the real world, bringing their respective brands of mayhem to high street locations.<br/><br/>The one-minute "It's Time to Play" TV ad includes a <i>Monster Hunter</i> encounter at a fast-food joint, Cloud Strife rumbling in the library, Kratos smashing through some boy's bathroom, the <i>Fortnite</i> bus making a drop off and, hilariously, Crash Bandicoot kart-racing through a multi-story car park which <i>actually features the disclaimer</i> "Dramatization. Do Not Attempt." Folks, I just report it.<br/><br/><i>Horizon</i>'s Aloy, <i>The Last of Us</i> star Ellie and <i>Uncharted</i>'s Nathan Drake also put in an appearance. All of this chaos is back by the Kaiser Chiefs' 2005 hit single "I Predict a Riot" as players and player characters converge to take over the city and overthrow the government (well, maybe I'm assuming that last bit).</p>
