AfriForum's Gerrie Nel to represent Senzo Meyiwa's family in murder investigation into Bafana star's death
05 Nov 2019, 11:28 by Azarrah Karrim
The head of AfriForum's private prosecution unit, advocate Gerrie Nel, will be representing the family of Senzo Meyiwa in a murder investigation into his death. 
The Bafana Bafana goalkeeper was killed during a robbery five years ago at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home. Five others were present at the time.
Feeling that no progress was being made by the National Prosecuting Authority after the police investigated the case, Meyiwa's family turned to the lobby group last month to take the prosecution forward. 
""It is important that AfriForum gets involved in cases such as these – it’s in the interest of the whole country,"" CEO Kallie Kriel said. 
""AfriForum serves as a counterweight to the failure of the state and, as a civil rights watchdog, it is our duty to prevent the criminal justice system from collapsing, he added.
