ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – In another step closer to digitalising the real estate sector of Pakistan and facilitating the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) in tax collections, the government has approved conducting a digital survey on sale and purchase of the properties in Pakistan.
Sources familiar with the matter told the media on Tuesday that the survey which aims to collect maximum possible accurate data of the properties would be completed within two years.
A Chinese-style ‘Digitised Land Survey’ has been suggested and upon completion of the survey, all information of properties will be computerised.
The exact calculation of the sale and purchase of the properties will be in accordance with current rates.
Importantly, the move will significantly help the FBR in property tax collection.
