      <h1>Seth Meyers' Netflix show has a button for skipping Trump jokes</h1>
      <h2>Not to be taken too seriously</h2>

      <h4>Why it matters: Netflix has never been one to shy away from adding innovative features to its service, and while this latest tool is more of a jokey implementation, it’s still quite interesting. In Seth Meyers’ new stand-up show, viewers will be able to skip any jokes about Donald Trump by pressing a button.</h4>
      <p>The feature will appear in Meyers’ Netflix special, Lobby Baby. It works in the same way as the service’s ‘skip intro,’ jumping past anything the comedian says about Trump.</p>
      <p>"It dawned on me that because it was on Netflix, there would be this opportunity to put in technology that would allow people to skip it," Meyers told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">CNN Business</a>. "It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, 'Oh, let me guess there's going to be jokes about the President.'"</p>
      <p>The button is a one-off and isn’t meant to be taken seriously—most people who are offended by Trump jokes are unlikely to watch the show—but it’s still a clever feature that could eventually find uses elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Meyers himself doesn’t expect people to use the button. "I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they'll put parsley on your plate and you'll think, well, that's a nice touch, but you're not going to eat the parsley," he said.</p>
      <p>Netflix's other experiments in recent times include choose-your-own-adventure Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. It’s also testing a feature that allows some Android phone users to speed up TV shows or movies.</p>
      <p>Lobby Baby is now available on Netflix.</p>
