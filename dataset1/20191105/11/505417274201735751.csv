05 Nov 2019, 11:49 by Sean McMahon

Saracens say they are “shocked and disappointed” in relation to the outcome of the independent disciplinary panel’s investigation into the alleged breaches of the salary cap.

Premiership Rugby this morning confirmed that Saracens failed to disclose payments to players in each of the seasons 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, in addition to having exceeded the ceiling for payments to senior players in each of the three seasons.
As a result, the club have been docked 35 points league points and also fined £5.3 million.
The club have confirmed they will appeal the decision.





You can find their full statement below:
Saracens Rugby Club is shocked and disappointed by these heavy-handed sanctions and will launch an appeal against all the disciplinary panel’s findings.The Club is pleased the Panel acknowledged it did not deliberately attempt to breach the salary cap and steadfastly maintains that player co-investments do not constitute salary under the regulations. This view is supported by independent legal and professional experts.The Club will continue to vigorously defend this position especially as PRL precedent already exists whereby co-investments have not been deemed part of salary in the regulations.As previously stated, the Club made administrative errors relating to the non-disclosure of some transactions to PRL and for this we apologise. We are pleased to confirm we now have a robust governance framework in place and this will be overseen by an external counsel to ensure the Club follows best practice.Furthermore, it is the Club’s belief that the Panel’s narrow interpretation of the regulations is detrimental to player welfare across the league and is damaging the development of elite level rugby in the UK.Saracens is proud of its pioneering, innovative approach to player welfare, developing their talents and supporting their entrepreneurial spirit for life beyond rugby.
