Damon was a guest on Conan O’Brien’s late night TV show last night (November 4) and recalled the last fight he’d been a part of, and that Affleck was the one who helped him out of it.
“I mouthed off to this kid that I knew, but he was like your height,” Damon said to Conan, “like six foot six, and I might have been 5’3 at the time, and I said something.
“I’d scored on him or something, and I don’t know, I said something but he came for me. And it was like this mountain of a guy came at me and I was like, ‘Oh man.’ So before I knew it, it was like I was on the ground, he was above me, and I was like, ‘This is gonna be bad.'”



Damon continued: “It was right then that little five foot two Ben Affleck tackled this dude off of me, like out of nowhere. I was, like, a junior and he was, like, a freshman, and he tackled this kid off of me, literally at the risk of his own life.”
“I remember that was a big moment,” Damon reflected, “going like, ‘This guy, he will put himself in a really bad spot for me.’ Like, ‘This is a good friend to have.'”
Earlier this year, Ben Affleck stepped down from his proposed role in the new standalone Batman film, with Robert Pattinson now set to play the part.
