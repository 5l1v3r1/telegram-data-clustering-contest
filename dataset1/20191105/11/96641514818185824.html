      <p>Deezer wants to remind you that Spotify isn't the only streaming service to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/30/spotify-podcast-playlists/">include podcasts</a>. It's rolling out a "Shows" tab <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/deezer-music-podcast-player/id292738169">on iOS</a> (Android and the web are coming later) that's dedicated to podcasts, radio shows and other non-music material. It divides audio into 15 top-level categories like comedy, education and fiction, and you can dive into sub-categories for more specific topics like parenthood. You'll also find podcast recommendations, and you can add any material to your personal library whether or not you're a paying Deezer subscriber.</p>
      <p>The feature is currently available in the US, UK and eight other countries. This probably won't have you rethinking your use of Spotify (or Apple Podcasts, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/10/google-podcasts-ios-desktop-search/">Google Podcasts</a>). It doesn't have to, however. This appears to be aimed more at existing Deezer users who want to discover new podcasts and listen without splitting their attention between multiple apps.</p>
