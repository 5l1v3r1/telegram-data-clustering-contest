Also, High Water 2020 will feature this:
This year sees the addition of The Platinum Pearl Experience, which provides fans with a weekend of endless luxury and exclusive access. Festival goers will enjoy an intimate performance with Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy at the historic Eternal Father of the Sea Chapel, access to the private Backstage Pearl Lounge where they can refuel with complimentary beverages and food, be able to watch performances up-close from the pit, learn from world-class award-winning chefs including James Beard semi-finalist and local rising star Jacques Larson, and much more!
