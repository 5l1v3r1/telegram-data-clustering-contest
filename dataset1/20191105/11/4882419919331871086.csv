Kylian Mbappe has constantly been linked with a move to Real Madrid and it appears that the first official offer will come next summer. Madrid need a new superstar to lead their 'new' team and Mbappe is their first choice. Despite recently signing Luka Jovic, most supporters spent the summer demanding that Florentino Perez released the funds to bring in the young striker forward.
It appears Madrid - and Florentino - will test PSG's resolve with a record transfer offer. The club is allegedly willing to pay up to €400m to bring Mbappe to the Santiago Bernabeu.



PSG are notoriously difficult to deal with and more so when it comes to players they want to keep. In fact, their response to this interest is to offer Mbappe €40m per season in order to tie the striker down to a new long-term deal.
