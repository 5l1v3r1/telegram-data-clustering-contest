      <p>MELBOURNE: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Steve-Smith">Steve Smith</a> struck a sparkling half-century to fire Australia to an emphatic seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in their T20 match in Canberra on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The former captain's unbeaten 80 from 51 balls gave Australia a 1-0 lead in their three-match series after the opener was washed out in Sydney on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SCORECARD: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/match-center/pakistan-in-australia-3-t20-international-series-2019-pakistan-vs-australia-live-cricket-score/scorecard/matchfile-aupk11052019190701.cms">Australia vs Pakistan, 2nd T20I</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Pakistan managed to do what Sri Lanka couldn't in the previous series -- removed David Warner -- but they had no answers for the peerless Smith, who put on a clinic of clean hitting as Australia mopped up Pakistan's modest total of 150 for six with nine balls to spare.</p>
      <p>"It was nice to be there at the end to get the boys home," Smith said.</p>
      <p>"It was probably a 170-ish wicket, I reckon, so they (Australia) bowled beautifully.</p>
      <p>"It was just about timing in the end."</p>
      <p>With both sides unchanged from Sydney, Pakistan elected to bat after winning the toss but their hopes of a statement innings were dashed by regular top order wickets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Babar-Azam">Babar Azam</a> was left to piece together the innings with Iftikhar Ahmed before the opener-captain was removed for 50 by a piece of fielding magic from Warner, who threw down the stumps from long-range.</p>
      <p>Iftikhar slogged his way to an unbeaten 62 to give Pakistan a total to defend.</p>
      <p>It soon seemed insufficient, however, as Australia skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aaron-Finch">Aaron Finch</a> and Warner stormed out of the blocks, smashing 30 runs in three overs before Warner was bowled for 20 by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammad-amir">Mohammad Amir</a>.</p>
      <p>It was Warner's first dismissal in five T20Is, having been two not out in the rained-out Sydney game and unbeaten with scores of 57, 60 and 100 in the 3-0 series sweep of Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>"We are disappointed but Steve Smith took the match away," Babar said through a translator.</p>
      <p>"It's very difficult when we lose early wickets and we have to gain the momentum again."</p>
      <p>Australia will seek to seal the series with victory in Perth on Friday.</p>
