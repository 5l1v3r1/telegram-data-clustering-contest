      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — PAS president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang said <i>zakat</i>, the Islamic wealth tax to help the poor, must prioritise Muslims first before others.</p>
      <p>He said the wealth must only be shared with other races once the Muslims are looked after.</p>
      <p>“According to our law, <i>zakat</i> cannot be transferred from state to state unless all poverty in the said state is abolished. <i>Zakat</i> must prioritise Muslims and only once all the Muslims have received <i>zakat</i> and there is extra, then can we look into helping others.</p>
      <p>“This is because <i>zakat</i> is based on looking at the observations and necessity of the Muslim people and is tied to the <i>ibadah</i> (worship) and <i>akidah</i> (faith) in Islam,” said Hadi during the launch of Muslim news portal <i>Harakah Daily</i>’s new look today.</p>
      <p>Recently, prime minister-in-waiting Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said <i>zakat</i> (tithe) institutions in Malaysia have been urged to carry out their responsibilities in a transparent and trustworthy manner to ensure a more effective distribution of <i>zakat</i>.</p>
      <p>He said in the context of a multi-racial society, Islam encouraged the distribution of <i>zakat</i> funds to non-Muslims, adding that this should not sideline the needy among the Muslims.</p>
      <p>Hadi, while agreeing with this, insisted that many Muslims are still poor in Malaysia and they need help first.</p>
      <p>“Islam however allows for leniency. When there is a lot of <i>zakat</i> and all Muslims are prospering then we can share with the non-Muslims in the spirit of humanity and living in a multiracial country,” Hadi explained.</p>
      <p>“This all depends on the current situation throughout the country. If Muslims still need help and are still in poverty then we need to help them first.”</p>
      <p>Selangor Ruler Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah weighed in on the issue, stating that <i>zakat</i> collections can only be distributed to eight groups of <i>asnaf</i> (eligible zakat recipients), including <i>asnaf fakir</i> dan <i>miskin</i> (those without any material possessions or means of livelihood), as well as <i>asnaf mualaf</i> (those who recently embraced Islam).</p>
