      <p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday told Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan to submit a written response to a contempt notice as she appeared before the bench to offer an "unconditional apology" — her second one in less than a week — for her remarks regarding a case.</p>
      <p>The IHC on October 30 issued a notice to Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Awan under Section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003, according to which she maligned the court while giving a statement that the hearing of a petition on the release of former premier Nawaz Sharif on Saturday evening was “a special dispensation”.</p>
      <p>While the court on Nov 1 <a href="http://dawn.com/news/1514202/ihc-reserves-verdict-on-contempt-of-court-notice-to-firdous-ashiq-awan">accepted Awan's unconditional apology</a>, it issued her another show cause notice for prejudicing the pending proceedings related to the petition seeking suspension of Nawaz Sharif’s sentence.</p>
      <p>During the proceedings today, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah said that it is a "huge crime to level allegations in a subjudice matter".</p>
      <p>"This court will not favour anyone. Action will be taken in accordance with the law," the judge said.</p>
      <p>He told Awan that in 2014, incumbent President Arif Alvi had filed a petition in the IHC on a holiday against the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf's (PTI) workers.</p>
      <p>"The court issued its orders on a holiday. The court had barred [authorities] from arresting [PTI] workers," Justice Minallah said and recalled that "a lot was said about [IHC] in 2014 as well".</p>
      <p>"Every judge takes an an oath with God as witness," the high court chief justice said. "No matter how big a criminal, he has the right to a fair trial."</p>
      <p>The judge further said that a "court is respected due to its verdicts".</p>
      <p>Awan offered the court an unconditional apology, saying, "I never talked about the judiciary in my 20-year career [as a politician]."</p>
      <p>The court asked if she had submitted a written reply, to which her counsel responded in the negative. Justice Minallah directed the SAPM to submit a written response within a week and adjourned the hearing until Monday.</p>
      <p>Awan's lawyer asked the court to exempt her from appearing before the court in person, but the judge turned down the request saying: "Her appearance here carries more advantage."</p>
