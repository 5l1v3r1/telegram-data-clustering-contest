      <p>A specific batch of the compact SUV, manufactured till May 19, 2019, has been recalled due to a faulty suspension component.</p>
      <p>Mahindra has issued a recall for a specific batch of the XUV300 compact SUV manufactured till May 19, 2019. As per a PTI report, the recall has been issued over a faulty suspension component, though the manufacturer has not revealed the number of units or specific batches affected.</p>
      <p>In a regulatory filing, the company said that owners of the affected vehicles will be individually contacted and that the replacement would be done free of charge.</p>
      <p>Mahindra launched the XUV300 in India in February this year, with the model rivalling the Maruti Vitara Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Tata Nexon in the popular sub-four-metre SUV segment. At the time, the compact SUV was offered with the choice of a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol and a 1.5-litre diesel engine, both paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox. Mahindra added the option of a 6-speed AMT unit for the diesel model in July.</p>
      <p>The carmaker is currently readying its compact SUV for an upgrade to meet the upcoming BS6 emission standards, with an <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mahindra-to-take-aim-at-hyundai-kona-electric-with-xuv300-based-ev-414327"><b>all-electric iteration of the SUV</b></a> also in the pipeline along with<a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mahindra-xuv300-based-7-seat-suv-takes-shape-414254"><b> a seven-seater derivative</b></a>.</p>
