      <h1>Police contact over 100 families after 'sexual assault of multiple children' at nursery</h1>
      <h2>Devon and Cornwall Police are investigating allegations of sexual assault of toddlers at the Jack and Jill nursery in Torquay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:50:53+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Nick Irving, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>More than 100 families have been contacted by police following multiple allegations of sexual assault at a children's nursery in Torquay.</p>
      <p>Today police said families had been contacted by them about the alleged sexual assaults at the Jack and Jill nursery in Devon.</p>
      <p>Detectives said a male worker - thought to be a teenager - has been arrested and bailed, and then moved away from the area.</p>
      <p>CCTV taken from the nursery has been looked at and could play a vital part in the case.</p>
      <p>Police first received information relating to the allegations at the nursery on July 29, 2019.</p>
      <p>Later that day they arrested the suspect, who has been bailed until November 22.</p>

      <p>A multi-agency response involving Police, Local Authority, NHS Devon Clinical Commissioning Group and Ofsted was launched to investigate the allegation of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Acting Detective Chief Inspector James Stock, of the Public Protection Unit said: "Since the information was received in July, a police investigation has been ongoing.</p>
      <p>"As part of this, over 250 hours of CCTV from within Jack and Jill Childcare have been reviewed.</p>
      <p>"As a result of CCTV enquires, a number of children aged 2+ have been identified as potential victims of contact offences.</p>
      <p>"We have now contacted all parents and guardians of children who attended Jack and Jill Childcare in relation to our investigation."</p>

      <p>The chief inspector outlined what the force had done to support the alleged victims.</p>
      <p>"Specialist officers from the Public Protection Unit and our colleagues from social services have visited the parents and guardians of those children we believe may be victims," he said.</p>
      <p>"They will continue to receive multi-agency support in the coming days, weeks and months.</p>
      <p>"The contact appears to be limited to within the nursery setting and we do not believe that any other member of staff had knowledge of these matters.</p>
      <p>"These appear to be the actions of a lone individual and the offences do not involve the taking or distributing of any images."</p>
      <p>DCI Stock stressed that the police were not investigating whether images or videos of the children were made.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is not an investigation into images being recorded and distributed.</p>
      <p>"We have to be really clear on that. The number of potential victims is much lower than 100."</p>

      <p>In the months since the arrest Ofsted has suspended the nursery's licence while investigations are carried out.</p>
      <p>The education standards body carried out an unannounced visit in August to check safeguarding "particularly with regards to allegations made against a member of staff".</p>
      <p>At that time Ofsted was satisfied that actions were taken.</p>
      <p>It later carried out a second unannounced visit in October and found that Jack and Jill was not complying with welfare requirements and a legal notice was served requiring urgent changes.</p>
      <p>Nancy Meehan, depurty director of Torbay children's services, said: "We take safeguarding children incredibly seriously, and we are working closely with partners including the police in relation to this matter.</p>
      <p>"We are providing support to the families, whatever is required at this difficult time."</p>
      <p>A helpline has been set up by the Partnership for anyone who may have concerns relating to this case.</p>
      <p>This can be accessed on 01803 208820 between 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.</p>
