Football Game Arrives On Switch This Week, But Don't Expect To Play Much Football
Things aren't as they seem
05 Nov 2019, 11:00 by Ryan Craddock



Launching later this week on Nintendo Switch is Football Game, but despite what the title might suggest, you won't actually be playing much football.
Instead, this one is a point-and-click thriller inspired by the classics of the genre released back in the '80s and '90s. You'll be joining Tommy, a local high school football hero, as he wakes up before a big game. He had planned to meet up with his girlfriend before the match, but something isn't quite right.
You'll soon find yourself exploring the environment by interacting with objects and inspecting them to solve puzzles, all in the hope of finding Tommy's sweetheart.
Features:- Traditional point and click adventure game aesthetic with puzzles and dialogue interactions- Meet a cast of characters including friends, foes, teachers, and a concerned mother- An award-winning OST by UK duo JUPITER-C



The game arrives on Switch this Friday, 8th November. You'll be able to pick it up from the eShop for $4.99 / 4.99€.
