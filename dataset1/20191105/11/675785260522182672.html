      <h2>Manchester City are refusing to sell Raheem Sterling to the Spanish giants after reports emerge of £70m-plus-Gareth Bale transfer proposal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:57:35+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Harris</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> will reportedly turn to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jadon-sancho">Jadon Sancho</a> amid <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>’s refusal to sell <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a>.</p>
      <p>Bernabeu bigwigs considered putting together a package worth <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/real-madrid-preparing-70million-plus-20808726">£70m plus Gareth Bale for Sterling</a> but City have no plans to lose the England star.</p>
      <p>As a result, they will reignite their interest in his international colleague.</p>
      <p>Real wanted to sign Sancho from Manchester City in 2017 but were beaten to the punch by Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old winger has since emerged as one of European football’s hottest prospects after wowing in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>According to the <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7648919/Real-Madrid-step-pursuit-Borussia-Dortmund-star-Jadon-Sancho.html">Daily Mail</a></i>, they have begun laying the groundwork for a deal in next summer’s transfer window.</p>

      <p>Dortmund are resigned to losing Sancho at the end of the season but know they can spark an auction for his signature.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are big fans of Sancho but the prospect of missing out on Champions League football will likely count against them.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain, who could be tasked with replacing Neymar, are also interested.</p>

      <p>Sancho is likely to go for a fee in excess of £100m, and City inserted an option to match any offer Dortmund receive as part of the deal that saw him move to Germany two years ago.</p>
      <p>If Real are successful, Sancho would most likely replace Gareth Bale, who is still available despite returning to Zinedine Zidane’s first-team plans.</p>
      <p>The Welshman has repeatedly been linked with a move back to the Premier League but he will not be moving to City as part of a swap involving Sterling.</p>

      <p>They have no intention of selling the forward while Bale is not wanted.</p>
      <p>Sterling is settled at the Etihad Stadium but has made it clear he is interested in playing abroad at some point in his career.</p>
      <p>He told <i>GQ</i>: "Looking at it now it's like, Manchester, I love it. I love it here. This is one of the best clubs in the world and I'm here for the long haul.</p>
      <p>"But you just don't know what happens in the future. I'm still young and, like I say, I am loving every minute.</p>
      <p>"Ever since I was a kid, 100 per cent it's always been a dream of mine to play abroad somewhere. It would be nice one day to finish training and go home and sit in your garden and eat some dinner.</p>
      <p>"I would need to see where it’s minimum 17C or 18C constantly."</p>
