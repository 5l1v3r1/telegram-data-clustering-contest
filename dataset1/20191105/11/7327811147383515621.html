      <p>FREEHOLD, New Jersey (WABC) -- Authorities are searching for a New Jersey woman who mysteriously disappeared last week, just hours after she visited a psychic.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Parze, 25, was last seen around 10 p.m. Oct. 30 after she spent a night out with family to see the well-known psychic in New Brunswick.</p>
      <p>The family came home together and Stephanie headed to the home she lives in that was once owned by her maternal grandmother.</p>
      <p>Stephanie's mother and father have been waiting to hear from her after she went missing without a trace. The wait has been an emotional roller coaster.</p>
      <p>"And we will see you soon and we love you so much," said Stephanie's mother Sharlene Parze.</p>
      <p>"Think about what daddy taught you, do what I told you to do," said her father Ed Parze.</p>
      <p>Her parents say Stephanie, who loves art, is a very independent person. She also is petite in size, standing 4 feet 11 inches and weighing 115 pounds.</p>
      <p>Missing posters have been put up around the town of Freehold and the family is standing by to get any word on the woman's whereabouts.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully she sees this and with every bit of energy that she has, to fight and get home to us," said Sharlene.</p>
      <p>Friends and family have gathered around Stephanie's parents to give their support. She comes from a very close-knit family that has become known in the area for elaborate holiday decorations.</p>
      <p>Her father would have begun setting up those decorations this weekend, but has been too distraught and too worried about his daughter to think about a celebration.</p>
      <p>"She'd be trying to reach us. It's not like her not to contact us," said Ed Parze.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is urged to contact Detective Shawn Murphy of the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office at 732-431-7160 ext. 7032, or Detective Daniel Valentine of the Freehold Township Police at 732-462-7908.</p>
      <p>Police say there is no threat to the public.</p>
