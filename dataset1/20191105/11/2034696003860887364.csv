The star’s first post on Instagram is a video of him explaining his reasons for joining the site, and what people can expect from his account.
“When people come to my page, I want them to see me,” he said.



McConaughey continued: “This is my first venture into sharing myself and my views with the world and I’m a little bit nervous about it because quite frankly.
“I’m not quite sure I want to have the dialogue. But I know I have to have the dialogue, too. So I’m looking forward to it.
The message continued: “I’m looking forward to sharing who I am with you, to seeing if who I am translates, if what I want to share translates…
“If it tickles your funny bone, if it makes you think a second, if it makes your heart swell up a little bit, if it makes you take a quiet moment and go for a walk.”
He concluded: “Let’s have some fun with it though.”
McConaughey’s latest role comes in new indie film The Beach Bum. In a four-star review of the film, NME‘s Ella Kemp says: “The Beach Bum is a film of vignettes, of cartoonish coincidences that link arms and stroll down promenades together. It roams, and has the best time doing so.
“It’s refreshing to experience a film fuelled by its prohibited life supplies, that so rarely feels anything less than tremendous fun.”
