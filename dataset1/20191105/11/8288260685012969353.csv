Don Goodman believes his old club West Bromwich Albion will take some stopping in the Sky Bet Championship this season.
Albion returned to the top of the table last night courtesy of a 2-0 victory at rock bottom Stoke City .
Matt Phillips gave Slaven Bilic 's men an early lead, and substitute Hal Robson-Kanu added a second from the penalty spot after the break.
The result took the Baggies two points clear of closest challengers Preston North End, Leeds United and Swansea City - with almost a third of the campaign gone.
