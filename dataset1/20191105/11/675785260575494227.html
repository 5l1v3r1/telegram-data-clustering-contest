      <p>Toronto Wolfpack are close to securing the signing of superstar Sonny Bill Williams on a multi-million pound two-year contract.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old dual code international, who has just finished his Rugby World Cup campaign with the All Blacks, is expected to finalise the deal within days.</p>
      <p>Williams is understood to have agreed terms with the ambitious Canadian club, who have just been promoted to Super League.</p>
      <p>Reports suggest it could be worth as much as £5million over two seasons, which could include taking a stake in the Wolfpack.</p>
      <p>The club is expected to unveil the former Canterbury Bulldogs and Sydney Roosters star at a press conference in London next week.</p>

      <p>Wolfpack coach Brian McDermott travelled to Japan to watch Williams play in New Zealand’s semi-final loss to England, and table the offer that will reportedly make him the highest-paid player in rugby league or union history.</p>
      <p>The club has openly expressed a desire to bring a “David Beckham-type figure” to Toronto, and now have their man in Williams.</p>
      <p>The forward - who has boxed professionally - was also chased by French rugby union clubs, but is thought to be excited at the prospect of helping rugby league grow in North America.</p>

      <p>The Wolfpack have already caused a stir in British rugby league after climbing the professional ladder in three seasons through expensively-assembled squads.</p>
      <p>But the capture of Williams will propel the Canadian club onto a different level as they look to make an impact in Super League next year.</p>
      <p>They will kick off their campaign with a double header at Headingley that sees them face Castleford Tigers before Leeds host Hull FC on Sunday February 2.</p>
