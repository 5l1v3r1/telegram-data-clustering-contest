      <p>A statement says police on Saturday approached a 31-year-old British citizen in a parked car near Slovenia’s border when he suddenly sped toward one of the officers who jumped aside to avoid being hit.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested shortly after. Police said Monday he was linked to two other British citizens who also on Saturday night tried to transport over the border a number of foreign citizens in a van.</p>
      <p>In neighbouring Slovenia, police say they have apprehended nine people from various countries for people smuggling and recorded a total of 150 attempted illegal border crossings since last Wednesday.</p>
