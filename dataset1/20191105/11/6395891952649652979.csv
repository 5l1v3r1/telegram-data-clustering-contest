BOSTON - Voters are set to head to the polls in 58 Massachusetts communities on Tuesday, deciding local races that the state's elections overseer said hinge on ""some of the most critical issues affecting citizens where they live.""
Fewer people typically vote in municipal elections than in statewide and presidential contests, and Secretary of State William Galvin said a turnout rate of 30 percent to 40 percent in any community would be ""exceptionally high.""

But, Galvin said, it's the local races that determine what a community will be like to live in, with impacts on public safety, education, transportation and the issue Galvin said seems most notable this year -- zoning.

""Zoning and land use development issues seem to be the preeminent issue throughout Massachusetts,"" he told reporters during an election eve availability. ""As I've traveled the state over recent months, it seems when you speak to local officials or candidates running for local offices, almost invariably the first thing they talk about is development. In some cases, it's the lack of housing development, in some cases it's about the nature of the development that's going on and the effect it's having on their existing communities.""
Voting hours will vary by community -- polls open at 6 a.m. in Franklin and noon in Lakeville, for example -- and Galvin said voters should check the list on his website to find their city or town's official hours.



Tuesday's lineup features 34 mayoral contests, including some uncontested races and contests to fill seats that are opening up. Galvin highlighted races in Revere, Medford, Fall River, Taunton, Melrose, Westfield and Pittsfield as particularly active.
Taunton Rep. Shaunna O'Connell, Melrose Rep. Paul Brodeur and Westfield Sen. Donald Humason are all vying to become mayor of their respective cities.
Fall River Mayor Jasiel Correia took a leave from his post and suspended his reelection campaign after his second federal indictment in a year, but his name remains on the ballot.
Galvin said his office has been in ""frequent contact"" with Fall River election officials and is aware of a write-in candidate there.
""We don't anticipate anything unusual,"" he said. ""The reason the incumbent's name is on the ballot is he didn't choose to make this announcement and drop his campaign until after the withdrawal period.""
Aside from mayoral races, voters will also pick candidates for city council, select boards, school committees and other local offices, along with deciding local ballot questions in some communities.
Yarmouth and Easton are holding elections solely to decide ballot questions, both overrides of Proposition 2 1/2 to allow those communities to raise taxes to fund municipal projects. In Easton, it's a new pre-kindergarten through second grade elementary school at the existing Parkview School site, while Yarmouth is seeking to pay $18,079,475 towards a new Department of Public Works office and garage.
Other local ballot questions include a proposed ban on non-medical marijuana retailers in Newburyport, a non-binding question asking Boston voters if they support re-naming Dudley Square as Nubian Square, and amendments to the Easthampton charter that would change the method of voting in city races to a ranked choice system.
The Legislature's Election Laws Committee plans a Wednesday afternoon hearing on ranked choice voting bills. Under a ranked choice system, voters rank candidates in order of preference and votes for the least-successful candidate are reallocated to others if no one earns majority support.
The group Voter Choice Massachusetts is also gathering signatures to put a ranked choice question before voters in next year's state elections.
Galvin, who has voiced support for the idea of ranked choice voting, said Tuesday he believes the concept is ""certainly reasonable"" but the initiative petition ""has some flaws in it that ought to be worked out.""
""I think the bigger issue with ranked choice is education,"" he said. ""You have to make sure the voters know that they have the right to make multiple choices, so those are all things that have to be ironed out.""
