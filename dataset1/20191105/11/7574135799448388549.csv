EarthGang played ‘Fallon,’ announce 2020 tour with Mick Jenkins
05 Nov 2019, 11:52 by Andrew Sacher



Atlanta rap duo EarthGang have been on the rise since releasing their very good new album Mirrorland (and becoming subject of a trending Twitter war), and after performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with The Roots last night (11/4), the duo added a slew of 2020 tour dates. The new dates have support from Mick Jenkins, which is an awesome double bill, and they follow the duo’s fall tour, which is underway as we speak.
The 2020 tour with Mick Jenkins hits Brooklyn’s Warsaw on February 13. Tickets for that show are on Citi presale now, with various other presales coming later this week and the public on-sale starting Friday (11/8) at 10 AM. All dates are listed below.
For an idea of what to expect on this tour, check out EarthGang’s Fallon performance — which includes a medley of “This Side” and “Bank” and looks and sounds awesome — below. As for what Mick Jenkins is up to, check out his recent single “Percy” below.
