（中央社記者余曉涵台北5日電）中央氣象局表示，9日到11日雖然是屬於乾冷的天氣型態，但受到東北季風影響加上輻射冷卻，中部以北的沿海空曠地區有可能出現攝氏17度低溫。
氣象局表示，今天受到東北風持續影響，越往東北部地區雲量越多，大致上仍屬陰天偶雨的情況，另外南海熱帶性低氣壓外圍水氣移入，中南部雲量仍稍多，花東地區及西半部山區有局部短暫雨的可能。
溫度方面，清晨各地低溫20至22度，白天高溫宜蘭約23度、北部及花東地區25、26度，中南部仍可達30度以上，中南部日夜溫差仍大，請適時調整穿著。
氣象局表示，類似的天氣型態預計會持續到下週一（11日）、下週二（12日），9日起將轉為乾冷的天氣型態。
氣象局表示，目前看來，9日起的冷空氣有到東北季風等級，9日到11日受到東北季風及輻射冷卻影響，中部以北沿海空曠地區有可能出現17到18度低溫，台北市低溫為19到20度。
至於今年第23號颱風哈隆5日早上8時的中心位置在北緯19.1度，東經152.0度，以每小時8公里速度，向西北進行，預計對台灣沒有影響；南海的熱帶性低氣壓雖然有發展趨勢，但對台灣影響程度也不高。（編輯：管中維）1081105
