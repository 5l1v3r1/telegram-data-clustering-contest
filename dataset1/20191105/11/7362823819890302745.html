      <h1>Washington Nationals' Davey Martinez snubbed for NL Manager of the Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:35:45+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> manager Davey Martinez was not among the finalists for National League Manager of the Year despite leading his team to the postseason for the first time at his position.</p>
      <p>While the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) voters submit their ballots prior to the start of the postseason, Martinez could have been considered as a candidate because of how the Nationals were able to get to the playoffs despite being under .500 at the beginning of the year.</p>

      <p>Martinez and the Nationals finished 82-80 in 2018. It was Martinez’s first season as Washington’s manager and when the team began the season 19-31 in the first 50 games, there were rumors about him getting canned in the middle of the season.</p>
      <p>However, Washington won 74 of their next 112 games and miraculously fended off the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a> and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> to get the second National League Wild Card spot. The Nationals finished the dream season by defying the odds and winning the World Series.</p>
