      <h1>Ron Paul Survey Reveals Most Prefer Bitcoin for 10-Year Investment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:18:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Almost 60% of 70,000 people would take Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) over <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat-money">fiat currency</a> as a long-term investment.</p>
      <p>That was according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/1191384535755317249">new survey</a> on Nov. 4 by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ron-paul">Ron Paul</a>, the ex-Texas Congressman who has become well known for his proactive position on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a>. </p>
      <h3>Ron Paul survey: 58% choose BTC</h3>
      <p>Part of a regular series of polls, Paul asked Twitter users about their investment preferences for $10,000 of value, delivered as a lump sum and untouchable for ten years.</p>
      <p>So far, out of more than 67,000 responses, Bitcoin is easily the most popular choice, with 58% of the vote. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Second in line is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gold">gold</a> on 33%, while fiat currency in the form of US dollar notes is trailing on just 2%. </p>
      <p>The results are even more complimentary for Bitcoin than Paul’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/50-favor-bitcoin-as-long-term-investment-in-former-us-rep-ron-pauls-twitter-surveym">2018 survey</a>, during which it finished on 49% after 59,000 votes.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin remains on mainstream radar</h3>
      <p>Paul’s advocacy likewise shows no signs of slowing as Bitcoin passes its eleventh birthday. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-us-congressman-ron-paul-receives-his-first-bitcoin">reported</a>, he received his first physical Bitcoin wallet last week courtesy of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bobby-lee">Bobby Lee</a>, the ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BTCC.</p>
      <p>The survey underscores the continued interest in alternative forms of money as global geopolitical uncertainty takes its toll on a number of countries’ national currencies. </p>
      <p>With new interest come new questions about user protection. This week, investor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/trace-mayer">Trace Mayer</a> took the message to mainstream audiences once again by announcing the second annual <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trace-mayer-get-your-bitcoin-off-exchanges-in-proof-of-keys-2020">Proof of Keys</a> event.</p>
      <p>Centered on making HODLers take funds off third-party exchanges, Proof of Keys aims to educate cryptocurrency users about the responsibilities involved in using money that does not depend on a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/central-bank">central bank</a>.</p>
