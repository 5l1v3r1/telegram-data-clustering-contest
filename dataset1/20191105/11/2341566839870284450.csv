（中央社記者林育立柏林4日專電）德國汽車大廠福斯新一代的純電動車ID.3今天量產，象徵福斯正式邁入電動車時代。福斯還打算在未來10年推出70款純電動車，有機會超越特斯拉成為全球主要的電動車製造商。
福斯（Volkswagen）集團是全球汽車工業的龍頭，去年一共賣出1083萬輛車。4年前爆發柴油引擎造假的醜聞後，福斯即全力布局純電動車，今年9月在法蘭克福車展（IAA）首度發表全新的電動車ID.3。
福斯執行長迪斯（Herbert Diess）今天在德國東部的茲維考廠（Zwickau）舉行的量產儀式表示，對福斯而言，ID.3的量產是「關鍵性的時刻」，福斯的未來將從茲維考開始。
迪斯強調，業界已經沒有人懷疑電動車能不能成功，問題是多快能實現，以及先在世界上哪個地區實現，他相信德國汽車工業在電動車時代依然能保住領先地位。
特地從柏林趕來參加量產儀式的德國總理梅克爾（Angela Merkel）讚揚福斯在汽車工業轉型的過程中走在前面，她承諾政府將透過廣建充電樁和加碼購車補助的方式，讓德國成為電動車的領導市場。



ID.3是福斯進入電動車時代的象徵，在集團歷史上的地位相當於金龜車和Golf車款，被福斯寄與厚望。
ID.3續航力300公里上下的入門款，最低售價3萬歐元（約新台幣100萬元），在德國因此有「國民電動車」之稱，預計明年夏天開始交貨，
茲維考廠未來將成為福斯電動車的主要產地，明年產量可達10萬輛，後年33萬輛，加上美國、中國安亭和佛山的廠也將改產電動車，2022年福斯的電動車產量將逼近100萬輛。
福斯並計劃在2028年前推出70款純電動車，有機會超越特斯拉（Tesla）成為世界上主要的電動車製造商。（編輯：高照芬）1081105
