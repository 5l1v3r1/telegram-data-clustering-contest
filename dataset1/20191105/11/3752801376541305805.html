      <h1>AfriForum's Gerrie Nel to represent Senzo Meyiwa's family in murder investigation into Bafana star's death</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:28:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>The head of AfriForum's private prosecution unit, advocate Gerrie Nel, will be representing the family of Senzo Meyiwa in a murder investigation into his death. </p>
      <p>The Bafana Bafana goalkeeper was killed during a robbery five years ago at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home. Five others were present at the time.</p>
      <p>Feeling that <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/senzo-meyiwas-family-turns-to-afriforum-to-help-prosecute-his-killers-20191025">no progress was being made</a> by the National Prosecuting Authority after the police investigated the case, Meyiwa's family turned to the lobby group last month to take the prosecution forward. </p>
      <p>"It is important that AfriForum gets involved in cases such as these – it’s in the interest of the whole country," CEO Kallie Kriel said. </p>
      <p>"AfriForum serves as a counterweight to the failure of the state and, as a civil rights watchdog, it is our duty to prevent the criminal justice system from collapsing, he added.</p>
