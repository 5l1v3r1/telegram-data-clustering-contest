      <p>Metal-friendly Nordic dark folk band <b>Heilung</b> recently announced their <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/heilung-are-bringing-their-viking-show-on-first-ever-north-american-tour/">first-ever North American tour</a>, and the anticipation for it is clearly high. They quickly sold out several shows, and they’ve been upgrading some to larger venues and adding more dates. The Chicago show was <a href="http://chicago.brooklynvegan.com/heilung-move-vic-show-to-the-riv/">moved from the Vic to the Riv</a> (and now sold out again), and a second NYC show was just added.</p>
      <p>Heilung now also play <b>Webster Hall on January 29</b>, five days after their previously announced, sold-out show at the same venue on 1/24. <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www1.ticketmaster.com/heilung/event/00005764EDBEA51F"><b>Tickets</b></a> for the newly-added show go on sale Friday (11/8) at 10 AM with an AmEx presale starting Wednesday (11/6) at 10 AM.</p>
      <p>It seems like more North American dates may be TBA, so stay tuned. All currently announced dates are listed below.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Heilung released their sophomore album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/15-new-metal-songs-out-this-week/"><i>Furtha</i></a> on Season of Mist. As we <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/heilung-are-bringing-their-viking-show-on-first-ever-north-american-tour/">wrote previously</a>, if it seems surprising how quickly they are selling out good-sized venues like Webster Hall, it’s worth noting that their new album sold well, their videos have tons of views, their live show is elaborate, they’ve already <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=351234695489199">soundtracked a Game of Thrones commercial</a>, and this traditional style of “world music” has especially been growing in popularity in Europe where similar band Wardruna recently announced that they signed to Sony.</p>
