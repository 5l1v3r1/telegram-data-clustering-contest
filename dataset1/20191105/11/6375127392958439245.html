      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has formally appointed Vice President Leni Robredo as the co-chair of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Panelo said the position gives Robredo oversight function over drug enforcement agencies and offices, including the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the Dangerous Drugs Board and the Philippine National Police until the end of her term on June 30, 2022.</p>
      <p>Panelo said Malacañang hopes that critics of the administration will see that Duterte is sincere in his offer to Robredo.</p>
      <p>Robredo has been refusing to give any further comment on Duterte’s offer, pending an official letter from Malacañang.</p>
      <p>Panelo says Robredo can decline the appointment if she doesn’t want the post.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the PNP said it “will comply with, and abide by the order of the President.”</p>
      <p>“The PNP will extend its utmost courtesy, cooperation and full assistance to the Vice President,” said PNP spokesman Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac in reaction to Mrs. Robredo’s designation as co-chair of the anti-drugs committee.</p>
