SA Taiwan nag-celebrate ng kanyang 66th birthday ang actress-politician na si Rep. Vilma Santos-Recto kasama ang kanyang pamilya – ang kanyang mister na si Sen. Ralph Recto, mga anak na sina Luis Manzano at Ryan Christian Recto at kasintahan ni Luis na si Jessy Mendiola kasama ang ibang kaanak at malalapit sa pamilya ng Star for all Seasons.
Habang nasa Taiwan ay nag-Facebook Live si Luis sa isang restaurant na ikinatuwa hindi lamang ng fans ni Luis kundi ng kanyang inang si Vi na binati ng kanyang mga tagahanga from all over the world.
Vi turned 66 last November 3.
Samantala, may mga fans na humihiling na sana’y muling magsama sa pelikula ang mag-inang Vi at Luis  bilang follow-up sa kanilang hit and critically-acclaimed movie, ang “In My Life” in 2009 na dinirek ni Olivia Lamasan (na siyang managing director ngayon ng Star Cinema) at kung saan din tampok si John Lloyd Cruz and produced by Star Cinema.  Given the chance, open ang mag-ina dito.
Samantala, hindi  naman daw napipikon si Luis sa kakukulit sa kanila ng kasintahan niyang si Jessy kung kelan sila magpapakasal. Inamin ng binata  na sumasagi na ito umano  sa kanilang usapan.
