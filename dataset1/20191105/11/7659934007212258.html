      <p>UN Envoy for the peace process in the Middle East Nikolai Miladinov arrived in Gaza Strip on Monday and met with Hamas leaders to push for an agreement on elections.<br/><br/>The United Nations has been working to make the electoral process a success and has pledged to provide the necessary assistance.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas wants “clear written responses” from Palestinian factions regarding the elections, said Fatah Movement Deputy Chief Mahmoud al-Aloul.<br/><br/>Abbas wrote down his vision on holding the elections in a paper that was handed to Chairman of the Palestinian Central Elections Commission (CEC) Dr. Hanna Nasser, Aloul noted.<br/><br/>Nasser will review this paper and pass it through all the factions to receive written responses, he explained, adding that some issues must be clear and provided with written consent such as the election law.<br/><br/>On some factions’ demand to open a comprehensive dialogue before issuing a presidential decree to hold elections, Aloul stressed that the “Fatah movement wants to maintain the positive atmosphere for the elections and prefer not to start dialogues that may lead controversial points that could affect this step.<br/><br/>He pointed out that his movement is not against the principle of holding a dialogue.<br/><br/>However, he stressed, after issuing the decree, all factions must meet and open an in-depth discussion to go to the elections with transparency and cooperation and build the foundations for Palestinian partnership.<br/><br/>Aloul was responding to a call by Head of Hamas' political bureau Ismail Haniyeh to hold an “all-inclusive national meeting.”<br/><br/>After meeting with Nasser on Sunday, Haniyeh said elections should include both presidential and legislative, leading to electing a new national assembly.<br/><br/>He stressed the importance of holding a national meeting to discuss all the details.<br/><br/>Haniyeh and Aloul’s statements point to obstacles that hinder reaching a final agreement on the elections.<br/><br/>Fatah wants to hold elections to end the difference in approving that who wins will control the West Bank and Gaza Strip, without factional meetings, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) or a reconciliation agreement.<br/><br/>While Hamas wants elections to be held within a general consensus on the outcomes of reconciliation and to include the PLO.</p>
