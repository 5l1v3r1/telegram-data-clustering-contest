      <p>Last month the folks over at <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-50x-zoom-future-smartphone/">XDA Developers</a> found traces code that pointed towards a likely launch of a smartphone from Xiaomi with zoom camera. The code was found inside a beta software update of MiUI 11 rolled by Xiaomi.</p>
      <p>Now it looks like the information was right as <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/xiaomi-telefoon-zoomcamera">Letsgodigital</a> has uncovered a patent showing the design of a device with a zoom camera. The patent was titled “Mobile Phone” was published by The Hague International Design System on August 9, 2019. The patent shows sketches of a smartphone with a zoom camera on the top followed by two more cameras and what looks like a ToF sensor or a flash.</p>
      <p>The sketches also show a popup front camera which is aligned with the rear camera setup. Earlier today, Xiaomi introduced the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomi-mi-note-10-is-dxomarks-new-smartphone-camera-champion/">Mi CC9</a> which also has a really good camera setup. With the way, Xiaomi has been targetting mobile camera users, we might be able to see this patent in action soon.</p>
