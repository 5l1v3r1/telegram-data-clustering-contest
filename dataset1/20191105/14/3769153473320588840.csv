Kirby Blender Rig Version 4 was made thanks to all the support and downloads from the previous version! This character rig allows you to pose and/or animate Kirby to your heart's content. With easy to use and understand controls, bringing Kirby to life has never been easier.The main purpose of this rig is to create beautiful renders with Kirby. It's the difference between using an in-game model ripped from the game itself to make a render, and using a model that was made for cinematics and rendering.Save time on modeling Kirby yourself, and start making your own animations now!
