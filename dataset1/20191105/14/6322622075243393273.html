      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd’s (F&amp;N) net profit fell 17.7% in the fourth quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (4QFY19) to RM68.03 million from RM82.65 million a year ago, due to lower profit contribution from its Malaysian and Thailand operations and higher operating expenses incurred.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue, however, grew 2.9% to RM975.09 million, from RM947.64 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>Operating profit for the food &amp; beverage (F&amp;B) in Malaysia declined 27% to RM27.7 million in 4QFY19, mainly due to one-off and non-operating items. Excluding one-off and non-operating items, operating profit for the F&amp;B in Malaysia grew by 6.5%, F&amp;N said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, its F&amp;B in Thailand saw operating profit shrinking 11.7% in local currency due to higher brand investment and trade spending for new product launches, the group added. However, the drop was barely 1.8% in terms of ringgit to RM60.6 million, from RM61.7 million, given the strengthening Thai baht.</p>
      <p>The group declared a final single dividend of 33 sen per share, bringing total dividend for FY19 to 60 sen. This was higher compared with total dividend of 57.5 sen per share for FY18.</p>
      <p>Overall, the group’s net profit expanded 6.13% y-o-y to RM410.26 million in the full financial year ended Sept 30, 2019 (FY19), from RM386.55 million, as revenue increased 5.33% to RM4.08 billion, from RM3.87 billion a year ago.</p>
