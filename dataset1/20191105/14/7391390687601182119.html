      <p>Forgive us, mighty gods, because we have strayed far, far from your light. In the world of culinary mash-ups, we are always trying to go bigger and better, creating concoctions that are more feats of will than mere meals. And now, Sam's Club is joining those ranks with a<a href="https://www.samsclub.com/p/members-mark-mac-n-cheese-flatbread-pizza/prod23603201"> mac n' cheese pizza</a>. Their new <a href="https://www.samsclub.com/p/members-mark-mac-n-cheese-flatbread-pizza/prod23603201">Macaroni and Cheese Flatbread</a> has so much going on — and the name doesn't even do it justice, because we're really dealing with mac n' cheese, pizza, <i>and </i>bacon bits.</p>
      <p>"Crunchy bacon bits, melty mozzarella, elbow macaroni, and a creamy cheese sauce on a flatbread crust makes a delicious snack anytime," the <a href="https://www.samsclub.com/p/members-mark-mac-n-cheese-flatbread-pizza/prod23603201">description</a> explains. You might need to read that two or three times to really understand everything that's at play. But basically, we're talking carb on carb on cheese on carb, which happens to be my favorite combination of food.</p>
      <p>If you happen to be a Sam's Club member, you can pick up these boxes of two hefty flatbreads for $9.98. They're only going to be available through the end of the year, so if you like the idea of a combination of a mac, pizza, and the unholy, then you might want to stock up to keep you going through the winter. Some of us stay warm with the holiday spirit and some of us stay warm through the cheese spirit. Both are delightful and delicious.</p>

      <p>There's no denying our insatiable thirst for mac n' cheese — we won't just accept it in its classic, baked form.
