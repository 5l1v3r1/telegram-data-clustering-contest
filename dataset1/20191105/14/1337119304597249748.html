      <h1>Xiaomi’s first 108-megapixel cameraphone is here</h1>
      <h2>The CC9 Pro has five rear cameras</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:23:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg" target="_blank">Chaim Gartenberg</a></address>
      <p>Xiaomi has been teasing the idea for a few months now, and it’s finally here: <a href="https://www.mi.com/micc9pro">the CC9 Pro</a>, the company’s first smartphone with a 108-megapixel camera.</p>
      <p>Before you get too excited, this isn’t the mind-blowing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen">wraparound-screen Mi Mix Alpha that the company showed off earlier this year</a>, which Xiaomi promises will also feature the 108-megapixel sensor. (That phone is presumably still set for a limited release in December, though.)</p>

      <p>The CC9 Pro is a more conventionally designed phone by comparison, although it still managed to pack in five rear cameras: the aforementioned flagship 108-megapixel wide angle lens, a 5-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom (and 10x hybrid zoom), a 12-megapixel telephoto camera designed for portrait mode shots, a 20-megapixel ultra-wide with a 117-degree field of view, and a 2-megapixel macro lens for close-up shots. There’s also a sixth 32-megapixel camera on the front of the phone, which is housed in a teardrop-style notch.</p>
      <p>The 108-megapixel sensor in question is the same <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-takes-mobile-photography-to-the-next-level-with-industrys-first-108mp-image-sensor-for-smartphones">Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX</a> that the company designed together with Xiaomi, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20801750/samsung-108-megapixel-smartphone-camera-sensor-xiaomi-100-million-pixels-6k-video-recording">announced earlier this year</a>. The 1/1.33-inch sensor is unusually large (for a phone, at least). By default, it’ll shoot 27-megapixel shots that combine four pixels together, as is fairly standard on ultra-high megapixel-count smartphones. There is an option to shoot in the full 108-megapixel resolution should you want to.</p>

      <p>Wild camera specs aside, the rest of the CC9 Pro sounds like a fairly competent phone, with a 5,260mAh battery, a curved 6.47-inch AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint sensor, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 730G processor. It even has a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the software side, it’ll run Xiaomi’s MIUI 11 skin on top of last year’s Android 9 Pie.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://item.mi.com/product/10000198.html?selected=10000198&amp;pClass=p">Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro</a> will cost 2,799 yuan (around $400) for the base model, with 6GB RAM with 128GB storage, or 3,099 yuan (roughly $443) for an upgraded model with 126GB of storage and 8GB RAM. In typical Xiaomi style, there’s also a CC9 Pro Premium Edition variant that will cost 3,499 yuan (around $500) with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage and an upgraded “8P lens system” for the main 108-megapixel camera.</p>
      <p>The CC9 Pro goes on sale in China tomorrow, but there’s no word yet about a larger international release.</p>
