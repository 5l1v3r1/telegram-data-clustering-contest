      <p>NAYPYITAW, Nov 5 — The gigantic hot air balloon folded into itself and fell in a ball of flames, scattering onlookers below at the beginning of Myanmar’s stunning yet treacherous fire balloon festival.</p>
      <p>Nobody was hurt this time but every year several are injured at the event in Shan State’s capital Taunggyi, a highlight of the annual Tazaungdaing festival of light that marks the end of the rainy season.</p>
      <p>The celebration is rooted in Buddhism and draws tens of thousands each day.</p>
      <p>It has become a “festival for the whole of Burma”, competition judge Thein Zaw, 54, told AFP in between balloon inspections.</p>
      <p>After months spent working on their designs, competing teams launch — or try to launch — some 200 homemade devices over the course of the 10-day festival.</p>
      <p>They are weighed down with frames carrying hundreds of fireworks or candles, and a miscalculation on when to light the rockets can result in a fiery catastrophe.</p>
      <p>Points are scored for aesthetics, teamwork, height reached, and the duration of time spent in the air explained Thein Zaw, who has been on the judges panel for 13 years.</p>
      <p>Yesterday evening, the competition began after a dancing display by many of Shan’s ethnic groups and the release into the night sky of hundreds of traditional lanterns — albeit many with the modern twist of a company sponsor name emblazoned on their sides.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been coming to this event every year since I was a kid,” enthused Thuzar Lin, 26, after a kaleidoscopic shower of fireworks from her group’s creation rained on admiring onlookers.</p>
      <p>Most teams boast a mixture of men — who normally handle the gunpowder and wield the huge flaming torches used to set light to the burners — and women.</p>
      <p>This year, for the first time, a launch field had been fenced off — much to the disappointment of many thrill-seeking regulars, who in previous years had enjoyed front-row seats to the action.</p>
      <p>“It’s really changed the atmosphere. You can’t get involved like before,” said 31-year-old Zu Zue ruefully.</p>
      <p>The last fatalities were in 2014 when three were killed as a balloon crashed onto the crowds below. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
