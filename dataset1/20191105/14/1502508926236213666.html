      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:35:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jindal-steel">Jindal Steel </a>and Power Ltd (JSPL) on Tuesday posted a consolidated net loss of Rs 399.31 crore for the quarter ended September 30.</p>
      <p>However, the company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 279.17 crore in the year-ago period, JSPL said in a filing to the BSE.</p>
      <p>These are after-tax figures.</p>
      <p>Its total income in the July-September 2019 quarter declined to Rs 8,940.33 crore, over Rs 9,983.16 crore in the year-ago period.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the company said the quarter ended September 2019 highlighted the strength in the diversified and the differentiated product profile of JSPL.</p>
      <p>Products like rails, structures, plates and other such value-added products helped the company partially offset the steep fall in prices and profitability during the reported quarter, it said.</p>
      <p>JSPL, on a consolidated level, produced 1.99 million tonnes of steel and related products and sold 1.82 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>The company produced 1.84 million tonnes of crude steel on the consolidated level and sold 1.70 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>The net debt for the quarter ended September 2019 was Rs 36,501 crore. The net debt reduced by Rs 1,471 crore, excluding the impact of foreign exchange quarter-on-quarter.</p>
      <p>Backed by a slew of measures by the government, including cuts in corporate taxation, increased allocation and spending to infrastructure sector; the demand for steel could be better than the first half of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>Seasonally, period from October to March is better in terms of steel consumption with the rains waning and on the back of a pick-up in construction activity, the company said.</p>
      <p>JSPL further said it has also emerged as the highest bidder for Gare Palma IV/1 coal block (rated capacity 6 million tonne per annum) in Chhattisgarh in the recently held coal block auctions at a closing bid of Rs 230 a tonne.</p>
      <p>"This will help in increasing coal availability for the company's overall operations. It will also help the country in reducing its dependence on coal imports," the statement said.</p>
