      <h1>Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant spark relationship rumours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:35:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rory Sullivan, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Keanu Reeves has sparked rumors that he is in a relationship, after walking hand-in-hand down the red carpet with artist and philanthropist Alexandra Grant at an event in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>"The Matrix" star, 55, has reportedly been friends with Grant, 46, since they met roughly a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The pair, who were seen holding hands at the LACMA Art + Film Gala on Saturday, have previously worked as business partners.</p>
      <p>They collaborated on the books "Ode to Happiness" and "Shadows" in 2011 and 2016 -- with illustrations by Grant and text by Reeves.</p>
      <p>Grant explores the use of text and language in works of various media -- including painting, sculpture, drawing, film, and photography, according to her website.</p>
      <p>Reeves has had a busy year, appearing in the third installment of "John Wick" and voicing a part in "Toy Story 4." He will also resume the character of Neo in the upcoming "The Matrix 4."</p>
      <p>Reeves has become something of a national treasure after fans spotted how he has mastered the art of posing with women in a respectful way.</p>
      <p>A tweet showing images of Reeves posing with multiple women went viral earlier this year, with pictures showing his hands hovering either over women's arms or waists.</p>
