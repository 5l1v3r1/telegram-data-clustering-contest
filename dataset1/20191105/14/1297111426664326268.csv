Two people are in hospital after a rollover involving an allegedly stolen vehicle.
Police responded to the southbound lane of Albert Street North, north of the overpass, at about 1:50 a.m. Tuesday. Preliminary investigation indicates the vehicle was travelling southbound at a high rate of speed, entered the ditch on the west side of the highway and rolled several times.
The rollover caused damage to a fence and significant damage to the vehicle.
The two occupants were taken into custody and transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Charges are pending and the scene is now clear.
