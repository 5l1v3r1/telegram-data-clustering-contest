      <p>A charity golf day run by the Mears Group was a swing and a hit as it scooped £11,500 for St Andrew’s Hospice.</p>
      <p>The housing and care organisation, who work in partnership with North Lanarkshire Council, held the event at Dundonald Links.</p>
      <p>The fantastic five-figure sum raised during the golf day will help to provide specialist palliative care to patients and their families from communities across both North and South Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Louise O’Donnell, deputy head of fundraising at the hospice, said: “We are delighted to be working in partnership with Mears who, as well as organising their golf day to raise funds for patient care at the hospice, has continued to help us by being one of our key supporters over the years.</p>
      <p>“The dedication and commitment from everyone at Mears have been nothing short of sensational and we are so grateful that they have chosen the hospice to benefit from all of the money raised at the golf day.</p>
      <p>“Without the support of businesses like Mears, we wouldn’t be able to continue to provide the care and support that really makes a difference to the lives of our patients, and their loved ones, in Lanarkshire.</p>

      <p>Barry Duncan, managing director at Mears, added: “We are happy to be able to continue supporting St Andrew’s Hospice by organising the golf day.</p>
      <p>“The hospice plays an important role in caring for the people in Lanarkshire and Mears are proud to be involved. Well done to everyone who took part for supporting this absolutely fantastic cause.”</p>
