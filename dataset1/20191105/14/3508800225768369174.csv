《書店不屈宣言》：要我承認客人被亞馬遜搶走，這點真的很悲哀
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是亞馬遜雖然能便利購書、無微不至地服務讀者，但當這種「有效率的買書方式」闖入日常生活中，不就缺少選書失敗的樂趣，也少了許多選書的方法，不是嗎？



文：田口久美子
「所以這時候必須要從販售的基礎教起，他們也比較好理解。在池袋店，會盡量不平放書，希望將更多書放進書架上，這就是淳久堂打造出來的自我認同。但是在地方書店中，必須要將暢銷書平放，讓大家都看得到完整書封。開店時不用太講究活動，而是要從當地出身的作家、鄉土史等這類開始。在東京，做別人沒做過的事會成為話題，但是在地方上，如果認為這是大家都知道的事而理所當然什麼都不做，客人就不會上門。每次開店時，我都感覺到不管哪裡都有專家，也就是有學問的人。在仙台店便是有許多這種客人的店（比關西更西邊的店有別的負責人）。咦，這種海外文學怎麼會賣？而且還是全套的，連池袋店都賣不太出去的高價書，這裡有人會買。這是為什麼呢？或許專業書籍的成長會更顯著？我這樣想著再次下訂，結果專業書籍的銷售量卻沒有特別成長。」
我認為是客人孕育出書店的，與此更息息相關的是，店員能否創造出能掌握客人呼吸節奏的書區。書店和店員需要時間培養，如果可以的話，最好和當地的學校、大學建立好良好的溝通橋樑，就像多年以前，LIBRO的今泉正光還在前橋店時，他總愛找群馬大學的教授們那樣。
「直到數年前為止，我都還能掌握愛書讀者的喜好及反應，但是最近銷售反應卻有點遲鈍，大概喜歡書的人都漸漸跑去亞馬遜買書了吧。特別是新書，這是理所當然的事，畢竟淳久堂不會所有的新書都進。有時客人等了好久的新書終於發售，卻發生興沖沖地跑到書店，但期待落空的場面。然而書店不賣新書也會逐漸凋零，雖然有『書店通』說：你們畢竟是淳久堂，賣長銷書就好了。但置身書店，你會感受到新書使整間書店充滿活力。和其他大型書店比起來，淳久堂的新書確實低得不成比例，即使如此——」
「相反的，對書本沒那麼熟悉的人就不太會上亞馬遜，於是淳久堂逐漸向這類讀者靠攏，書架上的書，也在不知不覺間變成是符合大眾品味的品項，卻被出版社的業務說：這不像淳久堂的風格。但我們還是得生存下去。」
我們視為上賓的「專家．學問家」，也就是日常生活中身邊隨時都會有書的人，被新興網路書店．亞馬遜給奪走了。但以客人的角度來看，這真是個便利的時代。要一位書店店員承認這點真的很悲哀。
另一方面，亞馬遜的使用者有很大一部分是出版業相關人士，他們一邊說「書店要消失了好難過」，同時抱怨「書店沒辦法馬上買到需要的書」，轉頭就在亞馬遜下訂單。這些亞馬遜的重度使用者充斥在「書的周遭」。以職業別來看，出版業是使用亞馬遜比例最高的。
我認為，亞馬遜雖然能便利購書、無微不至地服務讀者，但當這種「有效率的買書方式」闖入日常生活中，不就缺少選書失敗的樂趣，也少了許多選書的方法，不是嗎？不、不，許多人會說，不買沒用的東西是現代人的生活準則，但是「文化」本來就是沒用與沒道理的結果，我輕率地這麼認為，但事實上，我內心也是如此輕率地這樣想。
當然亞馬遜不能代表全部的網路書店，但是眾所皆知，亞馬遜的業績遠遠凌駕於其他網路書店之上。我內心將亞馬遜當作靶子，對於販售「展現『日本支柱的日語』（即日文書籍）」的日本第一大書店，竟然是間美國企業，有著相當大的危機感。可能有許多使用者認為，亞馬遜不過就是個賣東西的小商店，本身也不是製造業，所以是美國也好、中國也好、韓國也好，完全不會影響到書籍本身。是這樣子嗎？銷售的平台不會和商品本身有任何關聯嗎？這樣壯大下去的美國企業．亞馬遜，誰能斷言它不會變成能對日本出版界施加壓力的團體呢？還是說，日本的書店之中，有人要創造比亞馬遜更大的網路書店？亞馬遜大概就怕這個吧，但是資金從哪裡來！
亞馬遜作為一間企業，它的努力使它在日本獲得成功，我承認我的「攻擊」不過是一種遷怒。
每當提到這個話題，我就會想起中村文孝。我問中村：「亞馬遜給學生10％的點數折抵優惠，這筆資金應該是來自它在日本不用繳的稅金，或是從其他商品賺來的盈餘，但是公平交易委員會（監視違法折扣的政府單位）為什麼當作沒看到呢？我認為這違反了再販制。」中村回答我：「亞馬遜只是冰山一角，因為日本是美國的附屬國。」當然他的回答是一種（半認真的）揶揄，但每次想起時都會覺得很遺憾。我在LIBRO時曾策劃過「特價書展」，結果和公平交易委員會有過爭論。
從另一方面來了解，有一份淺顯易懂的資料是關於「亞馬遜的稅金問題」，就是「二○一三年十一月十一日，國會中有田芳生參議院議員（當時為民主黨）的質詢意見書」，國會的質詢都用專業術語，這裡我試著做個簡單的摘要。
一是關於消費稅。
「亞馬遜將在日本進貨的書籍，用包含消費稅的固定價格賣給讀者，但這筆消費稅會交給日本政府嗎？」
另一個是關於法人稅。
「二○○九年國稅局針對亞馬遜公司追徵課稅，但為什麼後來兩國協商後，撤銷了國稅廳的主張？」
其後送來的報告書答道，關於消費稅，「因為亞馬遜提供跨國服務」，所以沒有課其消費稅，不過此點會列入未來的檢討事項中。（註：現在政府的稅制調查會正在檢討中）。
關於法人稅，則是「外國企業在日本沒有分店時不課稅」（日本亞馬遜不是分店，而是一間倉庫、運輸公司的意思？）
因為是極為簡易的摘要（裡面也有關於電子書的規範），若想閱讀全文，可以上政府的網站（二○一三年十一月十一日）查詢。
文庫版增補：根據二○一五年的修法，亞馬遜從日本顧客徵收的消費稅，似乎變成要付給日本政府。會寫「似乎」，是因為亞馬遜對於消費稅問題隻字未提。
亞馬遜明明就是美國的一間私人企業，日本政府為何對它如此言聽計從呢？雖然有人可能會覺得因為法律就是如此所以沒有辦法，但我深信「言論．出版」應該要特別對待，因為「語言」問題關係著一國的根基。
我想舉無論執政或在野黨都大力擁護書店的法國為例。根據出版界的刊物《新文化》（二○一四年四月三日）所述，在今年一月九日，法國成立「反亞馬遜法」，禁止網路書店「免運」。在課稅的部分，則請求繳納「自二○一二年起未繳的消費稅及罰金」，目前亞馬遜正在進行繳納手續。
法國的消費稅通常為19.6％，書籍是5.5％（報紙、雜誌是2.1％）。當日本消費稅來到10％時，出版界如果提出「出版物不課稅」，不知道結果會如何。出版（即使包含亞馬遜的銷售額）頂多是一兆六千億（二○一六年為一兆四千七百億）的產業，我不認為會對稅收有多大的影響，我甚至想要替出版業申請加入「即將滅絕？文化遺產」。
在二○○○年底亞馬遜進入日本時，身為書店店員的我本能地感受到威脅（其後它的威脅超乎我的想像）。但是另一方面，喜歡書本的我也認為，買書的選擇增加了，若不做書店店員也能利用亞馬遜買書吧。
一九九七年以後，出版品全體的銷售額持續下滑，我也曾想過，亞馬遜難道會變成救世主嗎？對於附近沒有書店，即使有也買不到想要書籍的讀者來說，只要用手點一點就能買到書，這完全可以預期出版品全體的銷售額會上升吧。
雖然現在是美國企業走在最前面，但日本很擅長仿效，如果這種便利讀者的銷售模式能在日本扎根，就算書店業受到打擊也沒關係。前提是整體出版業能朝正向成長。
但是，一邊是業績急速成長的美國商業綜合公司亞馬遜，另一邊則是以利潤低的出版品為主的日本網路書店，顯然後者的成長依然不足，而且最重要的是，出版品整體的銷售額不停下滑，就像是被窮追猛打一般。亞馬遜的銷售額佔整體出版品銷售額的10％（註），如今應該已超過這個數字（因為分母每年都在萎縮，所以佔有率不斷提高）。不，根據書籍的不同，尤其是專業書籍，所有書店都不敵亞馬遜，常常發生這種現象（專業書出版社的業務都這樣說）。亞馬遜成長成日本第一的書店，而且勢不可擋，日本的出版品銷售額（二○一三年為一兆六千八百二十三億日圓），和亞馬遜剛登陸日本的二○○○年（二兆五千一百二十四億日圓）相較，幾乎跌到只剩67％（出版科學研究所）。書店數量也是以同步的速度在減少（二○○○年到二○一三年，從兩千一百四十五間縮為一千四百二十四間，只剩下66％）。
亞馬遜以拯救之神的姿態改變了「購書方式」，事實上是在扯出版品銷售額的後腿吧？（亞馬遜，如果覺得我在找碴的話請提出反證）。
當然銷售額會不斷跌落，最大的原因仍是日本的產業、文化結構的變化，以及消費行為的改變。選擇「書」這種要費時閱讀的工具已經不夠聰明了，雖然我一直都相信，書本是娛樂也是用來累積知識的，但如今多數人認為書本只是資訊傳遞的手段之一。
不、不，即使如此，仍有很多日本人認為「書」是重要的，問題出在取得書的方法。
我頑固地認為，「有效率的購書方式」因為網路而改變，買書時的「故事」消失了，這如同一拳有效的痛擊。我甚至相信，書這種東西，從買書到閱讀時的狀況，都會影響人的記憶。
即使我像個傻子一樣大叫，但還是馬上就輸了。因為「現代」不需要這種「渺小的故事」，而且還不全是「快樂的故事」。
每天早上，當我將淳久堂網路訂單所要的書籍從書架上拿下來時，就會感覺自己作為書店店員的認同感正在耗損中。
「帶著大包小包覺得很酷的時代已經過去，現在不拿東西反而比較聰明。田口前輩，大家不想浪費時間買東西，所以到最後網路書店就流行了起來。」
小海這樣說。雖然我認為書本不一樣，但是果然，書本你也和它們同流合污了嗎？
註：二○一六年出版品總銷售額為一兆四千七百零九億日圓。日本的出版品總銷售額中，書籍及雜誌約佔各半，因此推定雜誌需求微乎其微的亞馬遜，其書籍銷售額就佔了20％。換言之，每五本書就有一本是從亞馬遜賣出的。

如果有一天，書店永遠消失，你再也看不到承載著文字重量的紙本書……


田口久美子不只是樂在熱愛的書本當中，更像母親般守護著它們——谷川俊太郎


二○○○年，泡沫經濟來臨，亞馬遜登陸日本。

如野獸般撕扯日本書店業，翻轉書店經營的傳統模式。同時，網路新浪潮席捲全世界，在日漸頹敗的書店文化中，紙本書已不再是讀者首選，無形的電子書儼然成為趨勢。書店正逐漸失去「販售的商品」迅速走向滅亡。
然而，身為書店店員的他們從未屈服。書店不只是販售書籍的場所，更是將承載著文字重量的紙本書，遞至讀者手中的一種知識與精神的傳承。他們正憑著微薄的力量持續奮鬥，對殘酷的現實吶喊出「書店不屈宣言」——作者以自身四十年書店工作經驗，記述了日本書店產業的興衰，深究實體書店與紙本書遇到的困境，並對書市有深入的觀察。透過與第一線書店店員們對話，記錄書店現場實錄。

""Bookstore Unyielding Declaration"": I want to admit that the guest was taken away by Amazon, this is really sad
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that although Amazon can facilitate the purchase of books and serve the readers in every possible way, when this ""efficient way of buying books"" breaks into daily life, there is no lack of fun to choose books, and there are fewer ways to choose books. No?



Text: Taguchi Kumiko
""So at this time, we must teach from the basics of selling, and they are better understand. In Ikebukuro, I will try my best to put books on the bookshelf. I hope that I will put more books on the bookshelf. This is the self-identity created by Yujiu. However, in the local bookstore, the best-selling book must be laid flat so that everyone can see the complete book. It is not necessary to pay attention to the activities when opening the store, but to start from local writers, local history, etc. In Tokyo, do Things that others have not done will become a topic, but at the local level, if you think that this is something that everyone knows and take for granted, the guests will not come to the door. Every time I open a store, I feel that no matter where I am. Experts, that is, people who have learned. In Sendai, there are many shops for such guests (there are other people in charge of the west side of Kansai). Hey, how can such overseas literature be sold? Even Ikebukuro stores sell high-priced books that are not going out. Some people here will buy them. Why is this? Perhaps the growth of professional books will be more significant? I think about re-ordering, and the sales of professional books. There is no particular growth. ""
I think it is the guest who gave birth to the bookstore. What is more relevant to this is whether the clerk can create a book area that can control the breathing rhythm of the guests. Bookstores and clerkes need time to train. If you can, it is best to establish a good communication bridge with local schools and universities. Just like many years ago, when LIBRO’s Izumi Masako was still in the Qianqiao store, he always wanted to find professors at Gunma University. That way.
""Until a few years ago, I was able to grasp the preferences and reactions of readers of love books, but the sales response has been a bit slow recently. People who like books are rushing to Amazon to buy books. Especially for new books, this is a matter of course. After all, Yu Jiutang will not enter all the new books. Sometimes the new book that the guest has waited for a long time is finally on sale, but he rushes to the bookstore, but he is looking forward to the scene of the fall. However, the bookstore will gradually fade with the sale of new books, although there are ""Bookstore Pass"" said: After all, you are a long time, it is good to sell long-selling books. But when you are in a bookstore, you will feel the new book to make the whole bookstore full of vitality. Compared with other large bookstores, the new book of Yu Jiutang is really low. Disproportionate, even then -""
""On the contrary, people who are not so familiar with books are less likely to go to Amazon, so Yu Jiutang gradually moves closer to such readers, and the books on the bookshelf are unconsciously turned into items that satisfy the public taste, but The business of the publishing house said: This is not like the style of Yu Jiutang. But we still have to survive.""
We are regarded as the ""experts and scholars"" of the guest, that is, people who have books at any time in their daily lives, and are being used by emerging online bookstores. Amazon took it away. But from the customer's point of view, this is a convenient time. It is really sad to ask a bookstore clerk to admit it.
On the other hand, a large part of Amazon's users are related to the publishing industry. They say that ""the bookstore is going to disappear,"" and complained that ""the bookstore can't buy the book immediately"", and turned around under Amazon. Order. These heavy users of Amazon are flooded with ""the circumference of the book."" In terms of occupation, the publishing industry uses the highest proportion of Amazon.
I think that although Amazon can facilitate the purchase of books and serve the readers in every possible way, when this ""efficient way of buying books"" breaks into daily life, there is no lack of fun to choose books, and there are many ways to choose books, isn't it? No, no, many people will say that not buying unusable things is the living standard of modern people, but ""culture"" is originally useless and unreasonable. I think so rashly, but in fact, my heart is so rash. Think like this.
Of course, Amazon can't represent all online bookstores, but as everyone knows, Amazon's performance is far above other online bookstores. I use Amazon as a target in my heart. The first bookstore in Japan, which sells ""Japanese that displays the Japanese pillar"" (ie, Japanese books), is actually a US company with a considerable sense of crisis. There may be many users who think that Amazon is just a small shop selling things. It is not a manufacturing industry itself. So it is the United States, China, or South Korea, and it will not affect the book itself. Is that like this? Does the platform for sale have anything to do with the product itself? Such an American company that has grown stronger. Amazon, who can assert that it will not become a group that can exert pressure on the Japanese publishing community? Or is it that some of the bookstores in Japan want to create a larger online bookstore than Amazon? Amazon is probably afraid of this, but where does the money come from!
Amazon as a company, its efforts to make it a success in Japan, I admit that my ""attack"" is just a kind of anger.
Whenever I mention this topic, I will think of Nakamura. I asked Nakamura: ""Amazon gives students 10% of the points discount, this money should be from the tax it does not pay in Japan, or the surplus earned from other commodities, but the Fair Trade Commission (monitoring illegal discounts) Why did the government unit not see it? I think this is a violation of re-selling.” Nakamura answered me: “Amazon is just the tip of the iceberg because Japan is a subsidiary of the United States.” Of course his answer is a (semi-serious) Oh, but every time I think about it, I feel very sorry. I had planned a ""Special Book Fair"" at LIBRO, and I had a dispute with the Fair Trade Commission.
On the other hand, there is an easy-to-understand piece of information about ""Amazon's tax problem,"" that is, ""On November 11, 2013, there were members of the Senate in the Congress (then the Democratic Party). Inquiries, the questions in Congress are in technical terms. Here I try to make a brief summary.
The first is about consumption tax.
""Amazon will sell books in Japan to readers at a fixed price including consumption tax, but will this consumption tax be paid to the Japanese government?""
The other is about corporate tax.
""In 2009, the IRS pursued taxation for Amazon. But why did the two countries cancel the idea of the National Tax Agency after consultation?""
The report sent later replied that the consumption tax, ""because Amazon provides cross-border services,"" is not subject to its consumption tax, but this point will be included in future review matters. (Note: The government tax investigation is now under review).
Regarding the corporate tax, it is ""the foreign company does not tax when there is no branch in Japan"" (Japan Amazon is not a branch, but a warehouse, transportation company?)
Because it is an extremely simple abstract (there is also a specification for e-books), if you want to read the full text, you can check it on the government website (November 11, 2013).
Supplement to the library version: According to the revision of the law in 2015, Amazon’s consumption tax imposed on Japanese customers seems to be paid to the Japanese government. I will write ""seems"" because Amazon has not mentioned the issue of consumption tax.
Amazon is clearly a private company in the United States. Why does the Japanese government listen to it so much? Although some people may feel that there is no way because the law is like this, I am convinced that ""speech. Publishing"" should be treated specially because the ""language"" issue is related to the foundation of a country.
I want to give an example of France, where the ruling party or the opposition party strongly support the bookstore. According to the publishing industry's publication ""New Culture"" (April 3, 2014), on January 9 this year, France established the ""Anti-Amazon Law"" to ban online bookstores from ""free shipping."" In the part of taxation, it is required to pay the ""consumption tax and fines that have not been paid since 2012"". At present, Amazon is in the process of payment.
France's consumption tax is usually 19.6%, books are 5.5% (newspapers, magazines are 2.1%). When the Japanese consumption tax comes to 10%, the publishing industry does not know what the outcome will be if it proposes that the publication is not taxed. Publishing (even if it includes Amazon's sales) is at most 1.16 trillion (2016: 1.47 trillion). I don't think it will have a big impact on taxation. I even want it. Apply for the publishing industry to join the ""imminent extinction? Cultural heritage"".
When Amazon entered Japan at the end of 2000, as a bookstore clerk, I instinctively felt the threat (and then its threat exceeded my imagination). But on the other hand, I like books, and I think that the choice of buying books has increased. If you don't do bookstore clerk, you can use Amazon to buy books.
After 1997, the sales of all the publications continued to decline. I also thought that Amazon would become a savior? For readers who don't have a bookstore nearby, even if they can't buy a book, you can buy a book with a little bit of a hand. It is entirely expected that the sales of the entire book will rise.
Although American companies are now at the forefront, Japan is very good at emulating. If this convenient reader's sales model can take root in Japan, it doesn't matter if the bookstore industry is hit. The premise is that the overall publishing industry can grow in the positive direction.
However, on the one hand, Amazon, a US-based commercial integrated company with rapid growth, and the Japanese online bookstore, which is mainly based on low-profit publications, apparently the latter’s growth is still insufficient, and most importantly, the overall sales of the publications. The amount keeps falling, just like being chased and beaten. Amazon's sales account for 10% of total publication sales (note), and should now exceed this number (because the denominator shrinks every year, so the share continues to increase). No, according to the different books, especially professional books, all bookstores are not against Amazon. This phenomenon often occurs (the business of the professional book publishers says this). Amazon has grown into the number one bookstore in Japan, and it’s overwhelming. Japan’s sales of its publications (1, 862.23 billion yen in 2013), and 2000’s Amazon’s landing in Japan ( Compared with 2,514,240 million yen, it has fallen to only 67% (published scientific research institute). The number of bookstores is also decreasing at a synchronous rate (from 2000 to 2013, from 2,145 to 1,424, leaving only 66%).
Amazon changed the ""book-buying method"" with the attitude of the god of salvation. In fact, is it the hind legs of the sales of publications? (Amazon, if you think I am looking for you, please give a counter-evidence).
Of course, sales will continue to fall, the biggest reason is still the changes in Japan's industry, cultural structure, and changes in consumer behavior. Choosing the ""book"" as a tool for time-consuming reading is not smart enough. Although I have always believed that books are entertainment and used to accumulate knowledge, most people now think that books are only one of the means of information transmission.
No, no, even so, there are still many Japanese who think that ""books"" are important, and the problem lies in the way they get books.
I stubbornly believe that the ""efficient way of buying books"" has changed because of the Internet. The ""story"" when buying books has disappeared. This is like an effective punch. I even believe that the book, from the time of buying a book to reading, will affect people's memory.
Even if I yell like a fool, I still lose immediately. Because ""modernity"" does not need such a ""small story"", and it is not all ""happy stories.""
Every morning, when I take the books I want from the 淳久堂网 order from the bookshelf, I feel that my identity as a bookstore clerk is being depleted.
""The era of feeling cool with big bags is over, and now it is smarter to take things. Tokio predecessors, everyone doesn't want to waste time buying things, so in the end, online bookstores became popular.""
Xiaohai said this. Although I think the books are different, but sure enough, do you have the same books with them?
Note: The total sales of published products in 2016 was 1. 449 billion yen. Among the total sales of Japanese publications, books and magazines account for about half of each other. Therefore, it is estimated that Amazon’s demand for magazines is minimal, and its book sales account for 20%. In other words, one out of every five books is sold from Amazon.

If one day, the bookstore disappears forever, you can no longer see the paper book bearing the weight of the text...


Taguchi Kumiko is not just in the books he loves, he is more guarded by his mother - Tanikawa Tanikawa


In 2000, the bubble economy came and Amazon landed in Japan.

As the beasts tear the Japanese bookstore industry, flip the traditional mode of bookstore business. At the same time, the new wave of the Internet has swept the world. In the increasingly declining bookstore culture, paper books are no longer the first choice for readers, and intangible e-books have become a trend. The bookstore is gradually losing its ""selling goods"" and is rapidly dying.
However, as bookstore clerk, they never yielded. The bookstore is not only a place to sell books, but also a kind of knowledge and spiritual inheritance that carries the paper book bearing the weight of the text to the reader. They are continuing their struggle with meager strength and shouting ""the bookstore unyielding declaration"" on the cruel reality. The author has written about the rise and fall of the Japanese bookstore industry with his 40 years of bookstore work experience, and has studied the physical bookstores and paper books. Difficulties, and have an in-depth observation of the book market. Record the live record of the bookstore by talking to the first-line bookstore clerk.
