      <h1>John Lundstram reveals Sheffield United's goal after climbing to sixth in the Premier League</h1>
      <h2>Chris Wilder's Blades are enjoying their best league campaign since finishing sixth in the old First Division in 1975</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:36:53+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>John Lundstram claims <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sheffield-united-fc">Sheffield United</a> are still targeting survival - despite enjoying their best campaign for 44 years.</p>
      <p>Chris Wilder’s Blades are sixth in the Premier League for the first time since Ken Furphy’s side, captained by club legend Tony Currie, finished in that position in 1975.</p>
      <p>United boast the meanest defence in the top flight, along with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , and have conceded just eight goals in their 11 games.</p>
      <p>Yet Lundstram, the two-goal hero of Saturday’s win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> , insists beating relegation remains their aim.</p>
      <p>“I think if we’re all honest, at the start of the season we wanted to stay up,” said the midfielder.</p>

      <p>“It’s still the same. We’ve had a good start, but it’s still very early and we can’t go getting carried away or anything like that. </p>
      <p>“This league can punish you massively so we’re not getting carried away. The aim is still to stay up.”</p>
      <p>Lundstram says the Blades have quickly adapted to the Premier League after admitting he was initially star struck by their big-name opponents.</p>
      <p>“It’s not the heights that I thought it was going to be,” said the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> trainee. “At first I was a bit in awe of all these players, but we’ve done really well and our players are just as good as a lot of the other players lining up against us.</p>
      <p>“At first I was thinking ‘what am I going to be like when we play <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ?’. But now as the weeks have gone, you do start to believe in yourself more and that you do belong at this level.</p>
      <p>“The belief we’ve got is the most important thing.”</p>
      <p>Lundstram, 25, has become popular with Fantasy Football players because he scooped 21 points for his goalscoring display against Burnley.</p>

      <p>He also earned points for the Blades’ clean sheet in the 3-0 win because he is wrongly listed as a defender.</p>
      <p>“All my mates were saying to me, ‘you’re down as a defender’,” he said. “I didn’t know because I don’t play it, but I get more texts about how I’m doing in Fantasy Football than I do for my performances on the pitch.”</p>
