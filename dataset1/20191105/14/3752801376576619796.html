      <p>A prominent US magazine columnist who says Donald Trump raped her more than two decades ago sued the president for defamation on Monday after he ridiculed her as "not my type".</p>
      <p>E Jean Carroll, 75, filed the lawsuit in a New York court, claiming Trump's denials of the alleged sexual assault had damaged her reputation and career.</p>
      <p>"When I had the courage to speak out about the attack, he defamed my character, accused me of lying for personal gain, even insulted my appearance," she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Carroll alleged earlier this year that Trump raped her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the mid-1990s following a chance encounter.</p>
      <p>She said the alleged sexual assault took place after Trump, then a famous real estate developer, asked her for advice on buying lingerie for an unnamed woman.</p>
      <p>The president denied knowing Carroll and accused her of "totally lying" when the claims were put to him in an interview with The Hill, a political news outlet, in June.</p>
      <p>"I'll say it with great respect: Number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?" Trump said.</p>
      <p>Carroll, who writes a long-running column in Elle magazine, became at least the 16th woman to have accused Trump of sexual misconduct before he became president.</p>
      <p>Summer Zervos, a one-time contestant on Trump's reality television show "The Apprentice", has also sued him for defamation after he said she lied in claiming that he groped and forcibly kissed her.</p>
      <p>Carroll's account was first revealed in an excerpt of her new memoir that was published by New York magazine.</p>
      <p>She said she never went to the police at the time because she was afraid of repercussions.</p>
      <p>The 27-page complaint filed in Manhattan, which seeks unspecified damages, accuses Trump of knowingly lying about the alleged assault.</p>
      <p>"He smeared her integrity, honesty, and dignity - all in the national press," it reads.</p>
      <p>Carroll said she felt compelled to speak up by the #MeToo movement in 2017 which saw dozens of woman make sexual assault allegations against famous and powerful men.</p>
      <p>"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled," she tweeted on Monday.</p>

      <p>"No person in this country should be above the law - including the president," Carroll added.</p>
      <p>White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham described the journalist's allegations as "false" and called the lawsuit "frivolous".</p>
