Your child's nativity part could predict their future job and earnings
As the roles are being handed out to budding Marys, Josephs and Gabriels across the land, new figures show the part we played can say quite a lot about where we end up late in life - and starring isn't always the best bet

Adults who played one of the oxen in their primary school nativity play end up earning more as adults than any of the rest of the cast.
That's according to new research that asked people some basic questions about their life - along with which part they had in the festive classic.
Brits who played the part of an ox now earn a cool £43,000 a year on average, more than double what people who played a sheep or a lamb now make, figures from Virgin Media show.
But while cattle aren't low-earning, it was Marys who ended up with the most social media followers, while narrators were most likely to get jobs as teachers.

The study found Marys were also most likely to be content in their adult life, with 92% of people who took the lead female role saying they are now happy with their lot. Josephs followed soon after, with 91% happy where they ended up.
There was also worrying signs of inequality among the heavenly horde, with former angels earning an average of £25,000 as adults but Gabriels making far, far more at £40,000 each.
And beating classmates to the prime parts isn't something we forget, either.
Some 22% said their role made them feel proud, one in five said it gave them confidence and 7% said starring in the play changed their life. 
Being passed over for the role of donkey isn't something we forget quickly, either.
While one in three said they were happy to hide in the chorus as they would have hated the attention, 9% admitted to wishing one of the stars fell ill so they could step in and the same number said missing out meant they never acted again.

Here's a breakdown of what happens - on average - to people playing the main roles in a traditional Nativity play:

Mary - £39k salary, most likely to work in retail, strong social circle, extrovert, does yoga
Joseph - £38k salary, most likely to work in finance/ banking, enjoys shopping, has a good social life, has a good sense of humour
Gabriel - £40k salary, most likely to work in marketing and communications, likes to exercise, reads more than three books a month
Inn Keeper - £37k salary, most likely to work in manual labour industry (ie plumbing), plays chess, enjoys puzzles
Angel - £25k salary, most likely to work in healthcare, optimistic, likes puzzles and going to the cinema
Shepherd - £29k salary, most likely to work in IT, enjoys going to the cinema, likes to exercise
One of the Three Kings/Wise men - £26k salary, most likely to work in construction, repair and maintenance, enjoys gaming, most likely to enjoy birdwatching
Ox - £43k salary, most likely to work in advertising, likes to be the center of attention, does amateur dramatics, most likely to be a pessimist
Lamb - £20k salary, most likely to work in healthcare, enjoys yoga, most likely to be introverted
