      <p>During last night’s <i>Late Night</i>,<i> </i>Seth Meyers welcomed back writers <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/late-night-impeachment-ad.html">Jenny Hagel</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/amber-ruffin-whistle-blower-late-night.html">Amber Ruffin</a> for a new installment of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/amber-ruffin-jenny-hagel-seth-meyers-black-squirrels.html">“Jokes Seth Can’t Tell.”</a> They covered all the punch lines Meyers can’t, like takes on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/uk-vagina-museum-london-scli-gbr-intl/index.html">London’s new Vagina Museum</a> (“Men are allowed, but they don’t know what to do once they get in there”), Glade’s “warm flannel embrace” scented candle (“Or as lesbians call it, ‘first base’”), and Coldstone Creamery offering limited-edition black ice cream for Halloween (“The ice cream itself it not limited — just society’s expectations of it”). Later during the segment, Ruffin and Hagel say they’ve invited a friend to come out and deliver some punch lines about women, after which Gloria Steinem walks out from backstage and joins them all at the desk. “The makers of the game Monopoly have announced they’re coming out with a female version of the game called Ms. Monopoly,” Meyers says. “It’s just like regular Monopoly,” Steinem adds, “but when you pass go you only get $158, and that’s only if you’re white.” The end of the segment — after the women encourage Meyers to tell one of the jokes — is just what you’d expect: “Black women and lesbians and feminist icons are <i>liars</i>!”</p>
