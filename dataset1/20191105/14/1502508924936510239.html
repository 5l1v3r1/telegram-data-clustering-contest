      <h1>Sebi issues detailed circular on Aadhaar e-KYC for domestic investors</h1>
      <h2>Under PMLA, entities in the securities market that are notified by the central government can undertake Aadhaar authentication</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>on Tuesday issued a detailed circular regarding the process to be followed for Aadhaar-based electronic KYC exercise for domestic investors.</p>
      <p>The circular mentions about the requirements to be fulfilled by entities registered with the UIDAI as KYC User Agency (KUA) as well as for sub-KUA.</p>
      <p>For such KYC process, there would be two options -- online portal and assisted investor e-KYC processes.</p>
      <p>Sebi-registered intermediaries and mutual fund distributors, who want to undertake <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>authentication services through KUAs, should enter into an agreement with any one KUA. They should also get themselves registered with UIDAI as sub-KUAs.</p>
      <p>Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), entities in the securities market that are notified by the central government can undertake <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>authentication.</p>
      <p>"Sebi-registered intermediaries for reasons such as online on-boarding of clients, customer convenience, increased efficiency and reduced time for client onboarding would prefer to use <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>based e-KYC facility to complete the KYC of the client," the circular said.</p>
      <p>For the appointment of such intermediaries and mutual fund distributors as sub-KUAs, the KUA concerned would send list of proposed names to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi.</a> The latter would forward the list to UIDAI for onboarding.</p>
      <p>"An agreement will be signed between KUA and sub-KUA, as prescribed by UIDAI. Sub-KUA shall also comply with the Aadhaar Act Regulations, circulars, guidelines etc. issued by UIDAI from time to time," the circular said.</p>
