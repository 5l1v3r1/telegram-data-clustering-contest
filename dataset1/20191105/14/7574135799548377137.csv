05 Nov 2019, 14:52 by Andrew Sacher



Ahead of The World/Inferno Friendship Society‘s annual Hallowmas show in Brooklyn, we premiered a stream of the band’s new demos collection and mentioned they’d have a new album called All Borders Are Porous to Cats out on January 17 via Alternative Tentacles (pre-order). Now they’ve released the first single off the album, “Freedom Is A Wilderness Made For You and Me,” which the band calls “New Romantic 2 Tone ska,” which is pretty much the perfect description of what this song sounds like. Listen for yourself below.
World/Inferno have West Coast dates coming up this month, followed by NJ (Stanhope house on 12/7) and Long Island (Amityville Music Hall on 12/8) shows in December, and then a New Year’s Eve show in Brooklyn at The Kingsland. That also doubles as their album release show, and Funkrust Brass Band are opening. Tickets for the NYE show are on sale now. All dates are listed below.



The World/Inferno Friendship Society — 2019 Tour DatesNov 18 – Anaheim, CA – Chain ReactionNov 19 – Los Angeles, CA – Moroccan LoungeNov 20 – San Diego, CA – CasbahNov 22 – Berkeley, CA – Cornerstone (Alternative Tentacles fest)Nov 23 – Sacramento, CA – Cafe ColonialDec 7 – Stanhope, NJ – Stanhope HouseDec 8 – Long Island, NY – Amityville Music HallDec 31 – Brooklyn, NY – Kingsland
