《批判之源》：平等作為一種理想還是有作用的——任何人都被視為同等重要

我們想讓你知道的是當今世界盛行的不平等導致了數以百萬計的死亡，而這些死亡本來是可以避免的。

【正義與普遍性】
第三節 為何平等重要
我們承認理想的多樣性，這本身並不是要為特殊的平等理想提供辯護。傑瑞米．瓦爾德隆（Jeremy Waldron）提出了他所謂的基本平等的原則，並把這個原則稱為「道德和政治思想的一個假設」。當我們關注「什麼的平等？」的爭論時，我們就應該詳細地說明這種平等。而瓦爾德隆反對這種具體說明。他說：
E1：道德論證囊括全部人的善，它不承認在此領域內對人進行任何更進一步的根本的劃分（比如把人分成男人和女人、黑人和白人等）。
在E1中瓦爾德隆引入了他所謂的「未分化的人類域」（an undifferentiated human range）的觀念。該領域與道德論證相關。這帶來了一個問題：為什麼所有的人都應該囊括在這個領域內。對於這個問題，如果人們回答說，所有的人都同樣地應得，那麼這樣的回答顯然是錯誤的，因為如果人們要對應得進行一種可行說明，那麼他就要把應得與授權這個一般概念區分開。而根據這種可行的說明，一個人應得什麼取決於他做了什麼。可是這樣做就把差別引入到未分化的人類域，然而瓦爾德隆卻建議，為了使基本平等的原則獲得它所要求的內容，這個域必須是未經分化的。如果有人說，由於人的能力事實上是相同的， 而這個事實為E1做了辯護，那麼這個說法也是一個錯誤，因為這是對一個錯誤做出肯定。
羅爾斯把正義和應得分離開來，並進行了論證。這個論證表達了這樣一種思想：人的能力方面的差別反映在個體或大或小的生產能力上，並取決於自然稟賦的分配。這種分配並不是那些從中得利或因之遭殃的人選擇的結果。換句話說，這是德沃金所謂的「原生運氣」。我們不能說，原生運氣的後果是從中獲利者或因之遭殃者所應得的。瓦爾德隆認為，未分化的人類域的理念需要找出羅爾斯所謂的域屬性（range property），並獲得它的支援。粗略地說，這是一個人擁有或者不擁有的屬性，說他擁有這種屬性，是由於他屬於某個領域所致，並在該屬性所隱含的尺度內擁有。這以適當的方式對所有人都是共同的。瓦爾德隆援引雷恩巴勒（Thomas Rainborough）上校1647年在普特尼辯論（Putney Debates）中的著名評論，並以此為例來說明，在英國革命的鼎盛時期，「在英格蘭最困窘的人跟最得意的人一樣有自己的生活」。他說：
言外之意是，儘管最困窘的人的生活在某種客觀的意義上與最得意的人的生活有別，但是窮日子對窮人很重要，就如富日子對富人很重要一樣。過日子對過日子的人很重要，因此就是一種域屬性，它適用於所有的生活，無論這種生活在「客觀意義」的領域內處於怎樣不同的位置。
羅爾斯自己所偏愛的域屬性是「道德人格所具有的能力」。在這裡「道德人格透過兩種特點而相互區分開來：（假定）他們擁有和他們能夠擁有一種善觀念⋯⋯第二，他們能夠擁有（和假定他們獲得了）一種正義感，這是一種正常地、有效地運用正義原則和根據正義原則行動的欲望，至少是在某種最小的程度上如此」。他堅持認為：
平等正義的充分條件，即道德人格能力完全不是嚴格的。假如當某個生來或是由於事故而缺乏這種必要的潛力，這叫做一種缺陷或剝奪。沒有哪一個民族或者獲得承認的人群缺乏這種屬性。只有離群索居的人才沒有這種能力，或者不能在最低程度上實現這種能力。人們在實現這種能力上的失敗是不公正的、貧窮的社會環境的或是偶發的事件的結果。而且，儘管一些人的正義感能力有差異，但這一事實不是剝奪能力較低的人享有充分正義保護的權利的理由。只要達到某種最低程度，一個人就有權享有和任何其他人同等的平等自由。
正如瓦爾德隆所指出的，「羅爾斯公然承認，他的立場是康德主義的⋯⋯康德也強調，人類都有領會和回應道德律的能力」。我們再次看到，對平等理想的表述和捍衛使我們回到了康德。我認為，此類論證最終必須導源於康德的這一命令，即人要被當作目的，而不單單是手段。拉茲不再訴諸這樣的想法。他說：「平等的尊重、平等關切等原則，無非就是主張所有人都是道德主體，就是主張人本主義。」但是拉茲的思想看起來不像是一種毫無力量的空泛之論。不是每個人都會接受平等的尊重這樣的觀念。瓦爾德隆引述了一個著名的段落，它來自牛津大學新學院的研究員和導師哈斯汀．拉什達爾（Hastings Rashdall）所著有關道德哲學的這部主要作品，該書1907年第一次出版。拉什達爾說道：
對人類高等種族所處的社會環境的一切改善都假定，高等種族不與低等種族進行競爭。目前這一狀況變得相當明顯。這意味著，無數的中國人或黑人的較低的幸福水準遲早必須被犧牲掉。在最終的意義上，這種較低的幸福水準可能就是這些中國人或黑人實存的實情。這樣數量少得多的白人才有可能獲得更高的生活水準。如果從平等原則本身來考慮，如果從平等一詞最顯而易見的意義來考慮，那麼這樣一種政策的道德性不可能得到捍衛⋯⋯具有更高能力（即獲得更高的幸福水準的能力）的個人或種族，相對於那些能力較低的而言，有權得到比平等的考量更高的待遇。於是，「每個人都只能算作一，沒有人可以多於一」這句準則就應該解釋為「在算計的意義上，任何一個人的善跟其他人類似的善是等值的」。
這是一種可怕的反平等主義的至善論。這種至善論強調，要把幸福概念化為手段，可以被用來關注：對一個個人來說，他的生活究竟過得如何，而不是對幸福的高低以及人的高低加以排序。反平等主義的至善論所強調的就是這種幸福概念的重要性。然而，即使我們完全不管拉什達爾的評論中所提出的概念問題，一個如此高度受人尊敬的牛津哲學家在一百年前竟然寫出這樣的東西，這樣的事實著實有助於我們理解為什麼20世紀是一個種族滅絕的時代，德國法西斯主義的大屠殺只是這些種族滅絕中最為慘烈的一次。
當然，正是因為奧斯維辛集中營，今天幾乎沒有人敢於公開肯定類似拉什達爾的那些見解。然而，即便否認人性的同等價值在公眾討論中已經過時了，但這並不意味著它已經從社會實踐中消失了。事實上，人們會說，我們這個時代的一個獨特的可惡之處是，雖然我們對平等尊重的理念做了大量的空頭文章，但是這一理念被有系統地違反卻是這個社會世界的常規特徵。
如下兩個例子或許有助於我們關注道德議題。首先，伊拉克戰爭引發了諸多爭議，其中一個爭議是英美占領軍殺害了多少伊拉克人。解決這個爭論所遇到的難題是，雖然占領者嚴謹地記錄他們自己的人員傷亡數字（好像是小心翼翼地完成的），但作為一個原則性問題，他們卻拒絕計算伊拉克人的傷亡人數。於是這個任務留給了非官方調查人員——例如，一組公共衛生專家。在2004年10月，他們估計有十萬名伊拉克平民死於美英兩國的入侵。這些平民主要是在空襲中喪生的。五角大廈（Pentagon）對此一估算表示異議，他們首先訴諸越戰，並以此來證明他們自己拒絕清點伊拉克死亡人數有其道理：如果當時白宮和美軍高級指揮官把精力投注在清點敵人屍體上，那會導致軍事上的失敗和全人類的災難。
但是，不難看出，拒絕清點伊拉克的死亡人數意味著這些死人在另外一種意義上——拉什達爾效益主義原則的意義上——不算數。拉什達爾的原則說：「每個人都只能算作一，沒有人可以多於一。」實際上應該被這樣解釋：有些人——「低劣種族」的成員——少於一。
我們相信，美國的對伊政策，在實踐上隱含地表明，它不像對待美國人那樣對待伊拉克人，但這並不需要我們相信，這種政策被有意識的種族主義態度所引導，並用這種態度來對待伊拉克人（或者一般地講阿拉伯人或穆斯林）。重要的是要追蹤該政策的有規則的、可預測的後果。這又引發了另一個緊密相關的議題。以上引述的有關伊拉克死亡人數的研究提醒我們，跟其他地方一樣，在伊拉克，美軍軍事力量的最重要的投送方式是轟炸機和導彈。當然，可以預料的是空襲會造成很多平民的傷亡。五角大廈把這類傷亡與戰鬥中的傷亡區別開來，並貼上「附帶損害」的標籤。這一中立化的詞彙大概是為了傳遞這樣一種思想：空襲所造成的平民傷亡是美軍在完成他們的任務時，針對武裝敵人的軍事行動中所產生的一種非故意的、讓人討厭的副作用。
但人們卻不容易看到，這種思想就足以免除美國軍事人員（和他們的文職首領）對「附帶損害」所應承擔的責任。別忘了，過失殺人罪是專門用來處理非故意殺人案子的。在非故意殺人案子中，人們可以用一種相關的方式表明，犯罪者由於過失而殺人。再者，空襲造成的平民死亡並不只是一個一次性的意外事件，而是使用空中力量的常規的、可預測的結果。因此，即便美軍飛行員及其文職官員、軍方指揮官沒有帶著殺害平民的目的行事，但是他們知道他們很可能造成平民傷亡這樣的後果。他們不能因此而否認他們應該為自己的行為所造成的這一後果負責。
當然，僅說他們不應該實施空襲是不夠的。即便我們把二戰期間對德國和日本的飽和轟炸的有關爭論放在一邊，當盟軍在西歐（諾曼第）登陸的日子裡，其空中力量對交通樞紐的攻擊還是造成了一萬兩千名法國和比利時平民的死亡。有人可能仍想說，如果我們權衡一下轟炸法國和比利時可能造成的平民傷亡數與讓世界擺脫納粹統治所蘊含的全部收益，那麼這些襲擊仍然可以因其擊敗納粹德國的目的而得到辯護。這也許就是格里芬所主張的那種權衡（trade-off）的案例，格里芬認為，我們必須做這樣的權衡並且這並沒有明顯地違反基本平等原則。當然，為伊拉克戰爭辯護的人會辯稱，在這個案例中，幸福算法（felicific calculus）會得出相同的結論，伊拉克的平民傷亡人數與擺脫薩達姆．海珊（Saddam Hussein）的統治、為伊拉克帶來自由民主制度所產生的益處正好互相抵消。
但是，首先，即便戰爭能夠這樣來辯護（我認為戰爭不能這樣辯護），這也不能免除行兇者的空襲造成平民傷亡的責任，而這正是美國和英國的政治與軍事領導人經常否認的應當承擔的責任。其次，即使把戰爭的直接動機問題完全拋在一邊，我們在伊拉克所看到的那兩種完全不同的做法——一方面是美國和英國為避免自己軍隊的傷亡而處處小心謹慎，另一方面是空中打擊造成常規的和可預測的大量伊拉克平民的傷亡——的確違反了基本平等原則。
特別值得注意的是，因為這兩者是有聯繫的：採用空襲之所以有吸引力，是因為使用空中武力可以減低己方軍隊陷入危險的機率。當然，如果竟然要求今天的將軍回到在第一次世界大戰中那些將軍的做法，即去積極地尋求傷亡，那麼這顯然是愚蠢的。但是強大的軍事力量造成了大規模的傷亡卻得不到一點懲罰，這種模式又確實讓很多人在道德上感到噁心。如果要明確陳述理由來說明人們為什麼會噁心，那麼一個重要的方式是說明這種模式違反了基本平等原則。
麻煩的是，在當代世界有許多案例表明，儘管人們不是直接以大規模的人員傷亡為目的，但其造成的不可避免的傷亡卻是有規律的和可以預測的，而英美國家從空中發起戰爭並不是其中唯一的案例。貧困和不平等確實也造成傷亡，其規模遠遠大於五角大廈。湯瑪斯．博吉（Thomas Pogge）已經搜集了一組令人噁心的統計資料：1998年，58.2億人中有12.14億人每天收入不到一美元；28億人一天生活的耗費低於兩美元，這是世界銀行制定的貧困線；每年有1,800萬人因為與貧困相關的原因而夭折，占死亡總數的三分之一。博吉估計，冷戰結束後的十四年間有2.5億人死於飢餓和可預防的疾病：「這些人的名字，如果以越戰紀念碑的方式列舉出來的話，將可寫滿一道三百五十英里長的牆。」
在日益增長的全球不平等的背景下，大規模的貧困仍然存在。全球人口最富有的5%的收入與最貧困的5%的收入之比，已經從1960年的30:1增長到1990年的60:1和1997年的74:1。博吉認為，不平等，尤其是南北之間的不平等現在如此之大，以至於只要全球總收入的1%，相當於每年3,120億美元，就足以根除嚴重的、遍及全世界的貧困問題。因此，「人類有可能從經濟上消滅饑餓以及可預防的疾病，同時這又不會給任何人帶來真實的麻煩，而這種可行性在人類歷史上是第一次出現」。
值得反思的是這個數額遠遠低於美國的國防預算。在2006財政年度，小布希政府要求國防預算不低於4,193億美元。一個人無須成為一個平等主義者，就可以贊成這種轉換：以相當保守的慈善（charity）為根據，人們就可以為這種轉換做出辯護，或者透過（拉茲所提出的）減少痛苦來為這種轉換做出辯護。博吉認為，由於已開發的富裕國家沒有這樣做，所以它要對每年1,800萬人的死亡負責，儘管沒有一個富裕國家積極地尋求這些人的死亡。他說：
在道德上，我們與全球貧困之間至少有三方面的重要聯繫。第一，他們的社會起始位置和我們的社會起始位置都是從同一個歷史過程產生的，這種過程瀰漫著大量的嚴重錯誤。歷史上出現的種族滅絕、殖民主義和奴隸制等類似的不正義都可以用來說明他們的貧窮和我們的富足。第二，他們和我們都依賴同樣的自然資源的基礎。但是在很大程度上，他們並沒有使用這些資源，而又沒有得到任何補償。富裕國家和開發中國家的菁英們以雙方共認的條款來瓜分這些資源，卻沒有「留下足夠多和好的」資源給其餘大多數人。第三，他們和我們共存在同樣全球經濟秩序中，這種經濟秩序往往要把全球經濟不平等秩序永恆化，甚至要加劇全球經濟不平等。
即使存在著這些聯繫，我們也未能採取嚴肅努力以減少貧困。這不僅僅意味著我們缺乏善行，而且意味著我們主動地用經濟手段致使成百上千萬的人受窮、挨餓和被殺。
在此，博吉把開發中國家和已開發國家皆視為大致上沒有多大差別的實體。這是錯誤的（他把貧困國家的菁英排除在外，而他們從「以國家的名義自由地借用⋯⋯自由地處置國家的自然資源的特權」中獲益）。在已開發國家也存在大量的財富、收入、資源和政治權力的使用權上的不平等：美國或歐盟的大多數公民對其統治者的政策和大型跨國公司有多少控制權呢？ 但是，博吉的基本點無疑是正確的。當今世界盛行的不平等導致了數以百萬計的死亡，而這些死亡本來是可以避免的。這些死亡——以及伴隨著這些死亡的所有其他痛苦，是有系統地造成的：它們是現存社會和經濟結構的常規運行的一個可預見的結果。雖然事實上沒有人是故意造成這些死亡，但是這並不意味著沒有人要對這些正在發生的死亡負責。這就像美軍的指揮官和全體空勤人員不能否認要對平民的死亡負責一樣，因為這些死亡是他們合規則地預見到的。
這個分析提出了各種各樣的問題，但我想集中思考的是這樣一個問題：如何恰當地描繪這裡所出現的錯誤。博吉認為，如果容忍貧困造成的死亡，那麼這就違反了我們都必須承擔的壓倒一切的消極性義務——我們都「不要錯誤地對待（不適當地傷害）他人」。博吉說：「如果繼續支持全球秩序，繼續支持那些塑造與維持這種秩序的國家政策，而不採取制度改革方面的彌補行動或保護受害人，我們就要對這些可以預見的不適當傷害承擔一種消極的責任。」當然這引出了責任範圍的問題：誰才算一個我們絕對不能傷害的他人？
這裡，基本平等的理念再一次發揮了作用。它要求任何人都被視為同等重要的。更一般地講，出生中的意外讓數以百萬計的人或者夭折或者短命且生活悲慘。當我們力圖清楚地說明在道德上這是如何可怕的時候，在我看來，它不僅僅是其中所包含的苦難的問題，而且還是這樣一個事實的問題：由於資本主義世界經濟體系的非人機制，與一些幸運的人相比，許多人被視為不屑一顧的，不值一提的，也不需要那麼多的關心。在德沃金的原生運氣的意義上，這些足夠幸運的人出生在更優越的環境中。所以，平等作為一種理想還是有作用的：它不是那種模糊的人本主義的胡扯，這種人本主義被拉茲當作胡扯而否定了。

我的出發點可以視為是一個康德式的問題，即：「超越」如何可能？

社會批判在最近幾年已然如火如荼。西雅圖和熱那亞的反全球化抗議以及伊拉克的偉大反戰征程，將資本主義和帝國主義的相關爭論，放回到政治與智識議程之中。但是在一個馬克思主義被邊緣化、深受後現代思潮影響的時代，社會批判如何在哲學上定位自己呢？在《批判之源》中，作者尋求系統性地處理這個問題。在第一部分，他考察了當代幾位極具影響力的批判理論家對這個問題的處理，如巴迪烏、比岱、博爾坦斯基、布迪厄、夏佩羅、哈伯瑪斯、內格里和紀傑克等人。
這些理論家視角中的局限，促使作者在本書第二部分勾勒出一個替代進路，批判實在論的本體論、馬克思主義的社會矛盾理論和平等主義的正義觀，是這個替代進路的主要元素。作者論證的主要推動力是要展示：對於任何試圖挑戰現存世界秩序的人而言，馬克思的政治經濟學批判仍然是無法忽視的。但馬克思的政治經濟學批判，只有在跟其他批判視角保持一種開放而有力度的對話時，才能具有當代價值。《批判之源》就是致力於這種對話的一次努力。

The Source of Critique: Equality as an ideal or a function – anyone is considered equally important
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the inequality prevailing in today's world has led to millions of deaths that could have been avoided.



Text: Alex. Alex Callinicos
[Justice and Universality]
Section III Why is equality important?
We recognize the diversity of ideals, which by itself does not justify special equality ideals. Jeremy. Jeremy Waldron puts forward what he calls the principle of basic equality and calls this principle ""a hypothesis of moral and political thinking."" When we are concerned about the ""what is equal?"" debate, we should explain this equality in detail. And Waldron opposed this specific statement. He says:
E1: The moral argument encompasses the goodness of all people. It does not recognize any further fundamental division of people in this field (such as dividing people into men and women, blacks and whites, etc.).
In E1, Waldron introduced his concept of an ""undifferentiated human range"". This area is related to moral arguments. This raises the question: why all people should be included in this field. For this question, if people replied that all people deserve the same, then such an answer is obviously wrong, because if people have to make a feasible explanation, then he should put the general concept of due and authorization. differentiate. According to this feasible statement, what one should deserve depends on what he did. However, this introduces the difference into the undifferentiated human domain. However, Valdron suggests that in order for the principle of basic equality to obtain the content it requires, the domain must be undifferentiated. If someone says that since the human ability is in fact the same, and this fact defends E1, then this statement is also a mistake, because it is affirmation of a mistake.
Rawls left justice and should score and made an argument. This argument expresses the idea that differences in human competence are reflected in the individual's ability to produce large or small and depend on the distribution of natural endowments. This distribution is not the result of choices from those who profit from it or suffer from it. In other words, this is what Dworkin calls ""the original luck."" We cannot say that the consequences of the original luck are the ones who profit from it or those who suffer from it. Waldron believes that the idea of an undifferentiated human domain needs to find out what Rolls calls the range property and get its support. Roughly speaking, this is a property that a person owns or does not possess, saying that he possesses this attribute because he belongs to a certain domain and owns it within the scale implied by the attribute. This is common to everyone in an appropriate way. Waldron cites Colonel Thomas Rainborough's famous commentary in the Putney Debates in 1647, and uses this as an example to illustrate that during the heyday of the British Revolution, ""the most embarrassing in England."" People have their own lives like the most proud people."" He says:
The implication is that although the life of the most embarrassed person differs from the life of the most proud person in an objective sense, poor days are important to the poor, just as rich days are important to the rich. Living is important to those who live, so it is a domain attribute that applies to all life, no matter how different the life is in the field of ""objective meaning.""
The domain attribute that Rawls himself prefers is ""the ability of moral personality."" Here, ""moral personality is distinguished by two characteristics: (assumed) they have and they can have a good idea. Second, they can have (and assume they get) a sense of justice, which is normal The use of the principle of justice and the desire to act according to the principles of justice, at least to a minimum extent."" He insisted that:
The sufficient condition of equality and justice, that is, the moral personality ability is not strictly strict. This is called a defect or deprivation if it is born or due to an accident that lacks this necessary potential. No ethnic group or recognized population lacks this attribute. Only those who are out of the crowd do not have this ability, or can not achieve this ability to a minimum. The failure of people to achieve this ability is the result of an unfair, poor social environment or an accidental event. Moreover, despite the differences in the sense of justice of some people, this fact is not a reason to deprive people with lower abilities of full right to justice. As long as a certain minimum is reached, a person is entitled to the same equal freedom as any other person.
As Waldron pointed out, ""Rolls openly admits that his position is that Kant's Kant also emphasizes that human beings have the ability to understand and respond to moral laws."" Once again we see that the expression and defense of the ideal of equality has brought us back to Kant. I believe that such arguments must ultimately be derived from Kant’s order that people should be treated as an end, not just a means. Raz no longer resorts to such an idea. He said: ""The principle of equal respect, equality and concern is nothing more than advocating that everyone is a moral subject or a humanistic one."" But Raz's thought does not seem to be an empty theory without power. Not everyone will accept the concept of equal respect. Valdron quoted a famous passage from the researcher and mentor of the New College of Oxford, Hastings. The main work on moral philosophy by Hastings Rashdall, first published in 1907. Rashdal said:
All improvements to the social environment in which humans are in higher races assume that higher races do not compete with lower races. This situation has become quite obvious. This means that the low level of happiness of countless Chinese or black people must be sacrificed sooner or later. In the final sense, this lower level of happiness may be the reality of these Chinese or black people. Such a much smaller number of white people is likely to achieve a higher standard of living. If we consider the principle of equality itself, if we consider the most obvious meaning of the word equality, then the morality of such a policy cannot be defended by individuals who have higher ability (ie, the ability to obtain higher levels of happiness). Or race, relative to those with lower ability, have the right to receive higher treatment than equal consideration. Thus, ""everyone can only count as one, no one can be more than one."" This criterion should be interpreted as ""in the sense of calculation, the goodness of any person is equivalent to the goodness of others.""
This is a terrible anti-egalitarian perfection. This kindness theory emphasizes that the concept of happiness should be used as a means to focus on: how much an individual lives in his life, rather than sorting the level of happiness and the level of people. The essence of anti-egalitarianism emphasizes the importance of this concept of happiness. However, even if we completely ignore the conceptual issues raised in Rashdal’s comments, such a highly respected Oxford philosopher wrote such a thing a hundred years ago, this fact really helps us understand why The 20th century was an era of genocide, and the German fascist massacre was only the most tragic of these genocides.
Of course, it is because of the Auschwitz concentration camp that few people today dare to publicly affirm the views similar to Rashdal. However, even denying the equivalent value of human nature is outdated in public discussion, it does not mean that it has disappeared from social practice. In fact, people will say that a uniquely odious thing in our time is that although we have done a lot of short articles on the concept of equal respect, this concept is systematically violated but it is a regular feature of this social world. .
The following two examples may help us focus on ethical issues. First of all, the Iraq war has caused a lot of controversy. One of the controversies is how many Iraqis have been killed by the British and American occupation forces. The difficulty in resolving this controversy is that although the occupiers carefully recorded their own casualties (as if they were done cautiously), as a matter of principle, they refused to count the number of Iraqi casualties. This task was then left to unofficial investigators—for example, a group of public health experts. In October 2004, they estimated that 100,000 Iraqi civilians had died from the invasion of the United States and Britain. These civilians were mainly killed in air strikes. The Pentagon objected to this estimate. They first resorted to the Vietnam War and used this to prove that their own refusal to count the death toll in Iraq makes sense: if the White House and the US military senior commanders put their energy on the enemy's body. That would lead to military failure and disaster for all mankind.
However, it is not difficult to see that the refusal to count the death toll in Iraq means that these dead people are in the other sense - in the sense of the principle of Rashdal's efficiency. Rashdal’s principle says: “Everyone can only count as one, no one can have more than one.” In fact, it should be interpreted as follows: Some people – members of “inferior races” – are less than one.
We believe that the US policy toward Iraq implicitly shows in practice that it does not treat Iraqis like Americans, but this does not require us to believe that such policies are guided by conscious racist attitudes and use This attitude treats Iraqis (or generally Arabs or Muslims). It is important to track the regular and predictable consequences of this policy. This has triggered another closely related issue. The above-mentioned study on the number of Iraqi deaths reminds us that, like other places, the most important means of delivery of US military forces in Iraq are bombers and missiles. Of course, it can be expected that air strikes will cause many civilian casualties. The Pentagon distinguishes this type of casualty from the casualties in combat and labels it with ""collateral damage."" This neutralized vocabulary is probably intended to convey the idea that civilian casualties caused by air strikes are an unintentional, annoying side effect of military operations against armed enemies when the US military completes their mission.
But it is not easy to see that this kind of thinking is enough to relieve American military personnel (and their civilian chiefs) of their responsibilities for ""collateral damage."" Don't forget that the crime of manslaughter is specifically used to deal with unintentional homicides. In unintentional homicide cases, one can show in a related way that the perpetrator killed him because of his fault. Moreover, the death of civilians caused by air strikes is not just a one-time accident, but a regular, predictable result of the use of airpower. Therefore, even if US military pilots and their civilian officials and military commanders did not act with the purpose of killing civilians, they knew that they were likely to cause civilian casualties. They cannot therefore deny that they should be responsible for the consequences of their actions.
Of course, it is not enough to just say that they should not carry out air strikes. Even if we put aside the controversy over the saturation bombing of Germany and Japan during World War II, when the Allies landed in Western Europe (Normandy), their airpower attack on the transportation hub still caused 12,000. Deaths of French and Belgian civilians. Some may still want to say that if we weigh the number of civilian casualties that could be caused by the bombing of France and Belgium and the total benefits of freeing the world from Nazi rule, then these attacks can still be defended for their defeat of Nazi Germany. This may be the kind of trade-off that Griffin advocates. Griffin believes that we must make such trade-offs and this does not clearly violate the principle of basic equality. Of course, those who defend the war in Iraq will argue that in this case, the felicific calculus will reach the same conclusion, the number of civilian casualties in Iraq and the escaping from Saddam. The benefits of Saddam Hussein’s rule and the introduction of a liberal democracy into Iraq coincided with each other.
But first, even if the war can be defended in this way (I don’t think the war can be defended in this way), this does not exempt the perpetrators from the air strikes that cause civilian casualties, which is what the political and military leaders of the United States and Britain often deny. Responsibility. Secondly, even if we put the issue of the direct motive of war aside, the two completely different practices we saw in Iraq - on the one hand, the United States and the United Kingdom are cautious in avoiding the casualties of their own troops, on the other hand It is the casualties of a large number of Iraqi civilians caused by air strikes that are routine and predictable — indeed violate the principle of basic equality.
It is particularly noteworthy that because the two are related: the use of air strikes is attractive because the use of air force can reduce the chances of your own army being in danger. Of course, if you want today’s generals to return to the generals in the First World War, that is, to actively seek casualties, then this is obviously stupid. But the powerful military forces have caused large-scale casualties without getting a little punishment. This model has indeed made many people feel morally disgusting. If the reasons are clearly stated to explain why people are disgusting, then an important way is to show that this model violates the principle of basic equality.
The trouble is that there are many cases in the contemporary world that show that although people do not directly target large-scale casualties, the inevitable casualties are regular and predictable, and the United States and the United States launch wars from the air. Not the only case. Poverty and inequality have also caused casualties, which are much larger than the Pentagon. Thomas. Thomas Pogge has collected a set of disgusting statistics: in 1998, 1.214 billion of the 5.82 billion people earn less than one dollar a day; 2.8 billion people spend less than two dollars a day, which is the world. The poverty line set by banks; 18 million people die each year for poverty-related reasons, accounting for one-third of all deaths. Boji estimates that 250 million people died of hunger and preventable diseases during the fourteen years after the end of the Cold War: ""The names of these people, if listed in the Vietnam War Memorial, will be written to a length of 350 miles. Wall.""
In the context of growing global inequality, large-scale poverty still exists. The ratio of the world's richest 5% of income to the poorest 5% of income has grown from 30:1 in 1960 to 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997. According to Boji, inequality, especially between the North and the South, is so great that as long as 1% of total global income is equivalent to $312 billion per year, it is enough to eradicate the serious and widespread poverty all over the world. Therefore, ""human beings are likely to economically eliminate hunger and preventable diseases, and this will not bring real trouble to anyone, and this feasibility is the first time in human history.""
It is worth reflecting that this amount is far lower than the US defense budget. In fiscal year 2006, the Bush administration requested a defense budget of no less than $419.3 billion. A person who does not need to be an egalitarian can agree to this conversion: based on fairly conservative charity, one can justify this conversion, or reduce the pain through (as suggested by Raz) This conversion is justified. Boji believes that because the developed rich countries have not done so, it is responsible for the death of 18 million people each year, although no rich country actively seeks the death of these people. He says:
Morally, we have at least three important links between global poverty and global poverty. First, their social starting position and our social starting position are all generated from the same historical process, and this process is filled with a lot of serious mistakes. Historically, similar injustices such as genocide, colonialism, and slavery can be used to illustrate their poverty and our wealth. Second, they and we all rely on the same natural resources. But to a large extent, they did not use these resources without any compensation. The elites of rich countries and developing countries divide these resources on terms agreed by both sides, but there is no ""left enough and good"" resources for the rest of the population. Third, they share the same global economic order with us. This economic order often eternalizes the global economic inequality order and even exacerbates global economic inequality.
Even with these connections, we have not been able to make serious efforts to reduce poverty. This does not only mean that we lack good deeds, but also that we actively use economic means to cause millions of people to be poor, hungry and killed.
Here, Boji regards both developing and developed countries as entities that are largely indistinguishable. This is wrong (he excludes the elites of poor countries, and they benefit from the freedom to borrow freely in the name of the state to freely dispose of the country's natural resources). There are also a large number of inequalities in the use of wealth, income, resources, and political power in developed countries: How much control does the majority of citizens of the United States or the European Union have over their policy of the ruler and large multinational corporations? However, the basic point of Boji is undoubtedly correct. The inequality prevailing in today's world has led to millions of deaths that could have been avoided. These deaths—and all the other pains associated with these deaths—are systematically caused: they are a foreseeable result of the regular operation of existing social and economic structures. Although no one actually deliberately caused these deaths, it does not mean that no one is responsible for these ongoing deaths. This is like the commander of the US military and all the aircrews can't deny that they are responsible for the death of civilians, because these deaths are regularly foreseen.
This analysis raises a variety of questions, but I want to focus on the question of how to properly portray the errors that occur here. Boji believes that if we tolerate death caused by poverty, then this violates the overriding negative obligation that we all have to bear – we all “don't treat (inappropriately hurt) others wrongly”. Boji said: ""If we continue to support the global order and continue to support national policies that shape and maintain this order, instead of taking action to protect or protect victims, we must bear a kind of foreseeable undue harm. Negative responsibility."" Of course, this raises the question of the scope of responsibility: Who is a person we must not hurt?
Here, the concept of basic equality once again played a role. It requires anyone to be considered equally important. More generally, accidents in birth have left millions of people either aborted or short-lived and tragic. When we try to clearly explain how terrible this is morally, in my opinion, it is not only a question of suffering contained therein, but also a question of fact: due to the non-human capitalist world economic system Mechanism, compared with some lucky people, many people are regarded as dismissive, not worth mentioning, and do not need so much concern. In the sense of Dworkin's original luck, these lucky enough people were born in a better environment. Therefore, equality as an ideal still has a role: it is not the kind of vague humanistic crap, this kind of humanism is denied by Raz as a nonsense.

My starting point can be seen as a Kant-type question, namely: How is ""transcendence"" possible?

Social critique has been in full swing in recent years. The anti-globalization protests in Seattle and Genoa and the great anti-war journey in Iraq put the debates about capitalism and imperialism back on the political and intellectual agenda. But in an era when Marxism is marginalized and deeply influenced by post-modernism, how does social critique position itself in philosophy? In The Source of Critique, the author seeks to deal with this problem systematically. In the first part, he examines the treatment of this issue by several influential critical theorists, such as Badiu, Biljan, Boltansky, Bourdieu, Chapello, Habermas. , Negri and Ji Jieke and others.
The limitations of these theorists' perspectives prompted the author to outline an alternative approach in the second part of the book. The ontology of critical realism, the Marxist theory of social contradictions and the egalitarian view of justice are the main elements of this alternative approach. The main driving force of the author's argument is to show that Marx's critique of political economy cannot be ignored for anyone trying to challenge the existing world order. But Marx's critique of political economy can only have contemporary value when it maintains an open and powerful dialogue with other critical perspectives. The Source of Critique is an effort to commit to this dialogue.
