      <p>Two nuns are now under investigation by the Catholic church after they fell pregnant while carrying out missionary work in Africa.</p>
      <p>The two women, from different orders in Sicily, were on separate charity assignments on the continent.</p>
      <p>One 34-year-old woman only found out she was pregnant when she went to hospital complaining of stomach pains.</p>
      <p>The other woman, a mother superior, was working with "fallen women and their children" when she discovered her own pregnancy.</p>
      <p>A Catholic church source in Rome told The Sun: "There is consternation at this news.</p>

      <p>"It appears that both women were back in their home nations and obviously had some form of sexual encounter.</p>
      <p>“An investigation has been launched; they both breached strict rules of chastity but the welfare of their children is uppermost."</p>
      <p>It is thought the women are likely to leave their religious work when their children are born.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Pope Francis, who has 18million followers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , said that some nuns had been sexually abused by priests and bishops, even using them as sex slaves.</p>
      <p>He also acknowledged that sexual abuse of nuns "was still taking place".</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters on a historic tour of the Middle East in February, the pontiff said the church had an issue and "the roots lay in society seeing women as second class".</p>
      <p>He said: "Pope Benedict had the courage to dissolve a female congregation which was at a certain level, because this slavery of women had entered it - slavery, even to the point of sexual slavery - on the part of clerics or the founder," the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis said sexual abuse of nuns was an ongoing problem, but happened largely in "certain congregations, predominantly new ones".</p>
      <p>"I think it's still taking place because it's not as though the moment you become aware of something it goes away."</p>
