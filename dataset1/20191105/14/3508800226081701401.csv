《去你的人生低谷》：從無知跑者到世界六大馬，我正一步步完成「不可能」
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是跑馬拉松的人，在跑馬功力精進同時，資訊搜尋能力也會大幅提升。在不斷鍛鍊的過程中，我更深入認識世界六大馬拉松，包括東京、柏林、倫敦、芝加哥、紐約，以及世界上歷史最悠久，而且是所有認真的業餘跑者最希望參與的馬拉松最高殿堂：波士頓馬拉松。



文：王冠翔
說說看，為什麼要跑世界六大馬？
「為什麼要跑世界六大馬拉松？」
回答這個問題之前，還得先談談我為什麼開始跑馬拉松？
「跑馬」這件事，每個人都有自己的起因或哲學，合理的、荒謬的、動人的、愚蠢的，畢竟面對這種折磨人的歷程，一位身心還算正常的跑者，無論如何都會找出一些能夠合理化或催眠自己的理由。
我的慢跑之路自然也是如此。
媽媽的離世，無疑就是遠因。原以為利用忙碌工作佔滿自己所有時間後，時間就會順勢帶走一切，卻沒料到情緒仍久久未能平復。自己早已不自覺深陷在電影《全面啟動》（Inception）裡所描述的「混沌」（Limbo），未死也非生，卡在什麼都不是的邊境徘徊，對於生活種種，感動與熱情不再。然而我並非獨身，不但有父有妻還有一對兒女，怎麼看都不能就這麼自私地躲藏在自己建構的灰暗空間裡，於是我奢望著能做些傻事，什麼都好，只要能帶領自己離開混沌。
至於近因，則是跟很多人一樣，遇上了身體老化、代謝退化，體重卻不斷進化的重重危機。恰巧有位好友在二○一三年我的生日時，送了我一只運動穿戴裝置，天時地利人和湊成了機緣，自己就開始了這樁傻事。
當你真心渴望，整個宇宙都會聯合起來幫你完成。
收到禮物的我卻一直不敢開箱，就這麼以拖待變了快四個月，一來總覺得對好友不好交待；再者，前面提到的危機依舊四伏。最後在同年八月，終於下定決心，展開定期慢跑練習。
說也奇怪，跑步運動就像是在「抓交替」，總是有人會告訴你什麼比賽要報名、什麼路跑得要參加。因緣際會下，我們一群人報名了二○一四年「東京馬拉松樂透」，而早年的東京馬並不需要「人品」掛保證，我們都幸運地中籤。而原先我也不特別關注東京馬，因為在東京馬之前，我們還安排了風景秀麗的「太魯閣馬拉松」作為東京馬前的模擬。但是老天似乎有什麼意圖，竟然就在二○一三年太魯閣馬拉松舉辦前被做掉，而後繼者理所當然取而代之，東京馬意外地頂了位，成為我的初馬，後來想想，這無疑是最美麗的意外。
二○一四年為了參加東京初馬，個人準備周全自然不在話下，我還特別夥同親朋好友訂作三十六件國旗裝，集滿四個家庭所組成的國際級應援團，浩浩蕩蕩地前往東京，除了稱職地幫我加加油，也順道幫台灣曝光，更重要的是讓孩子們親身參與整個過程，體驗到歡樂的氛圍、體認到歷程的艱辛、體會到運動的美好、體現台灣可以無所不在。
自此，「馬拉松比賽」、「家庭旅遊」、「曝光台灣」三位一體，成為我們家的一種生活、休閒與教育方式。而在二○一四年那霸馬拉松、二○一五年北海道馬拉松、二○一七年芝加哥馬拉松等，全都是「全家國旗跑旅」的最好實踐。
孤獨地自我訓練八個月共一千零四公里後，我完成了東京初馬！內隱的志得意滿與外顯的喜形於色自然不在話下，但太太似乎不怎麼理會我的個人突破，賽後慶功宴上，她逢人便積極抱怨我的東京馬「跑太久、跑太慢」，連帶導致她所帶領的國際級加油團在寒風中等候近十五分鐘。
俗話說得好：「秀才遇到兵，有理說不清」。
「哦，天呀！」我這簡直是「兵遇到秀才，42.195公里說不清。」雖然最後我以三小時二十分五十四秒完成東京初馬，但心中的雀躍歡喜立即被澆熄，深感罪惡的同時更認定自己仍有許多進步空間。常言道：「無論成不成功的男人，背後都有一位偉大的女人。」一念至此猶如當頭棒喝，自己當真是頓悟了。

而跑馬拉松的人，在跑馬功力精進同時，資訊搜尋能力也會大幅提升。在不斷鍛鍊的過程中，我更深入認識世界六大馬拉松，包括東京、柏林、倫敦、芝加哥、紐約，以及世界上歷史最悠久，而且是所有認真的業餘跑者最希望參與的馬拉松最高殿堂：波士頓馬拉松。
接下來還有什麼好想的，當然就是挑戰自我，期待能參與二○一六年「波士頓馬拉松」一百二十週年。而挑戰世界六大馬的念頭，也是在這個時期開始快速萌芽，我開始夢想著，期待自己在四十五歲前將它們一一完成，做為這段磨人歷程的逗號，或是驚嘆號！
當然，如同太太所積極抱怨的，我可得試著再快一點回到終點。
從我的六大馬到我們的六大馬
從懵懂無知的孤獨跑者，到完成世界六大馬拉松，在東京、波士頓及柏林三大馬之後，一切已然過半。路上陸續出現許多或靜或動、上山下海的戰友們陪我一起努力，今日的我正一步步完成昨日仍在腦海的不可能。
聖雄甘地說：「要改造世界，先改變自己。」我不但呆呆地力行這句話，也開始打算用不一樣方式和角度，繼續完成後來的三大馬。而接下來的就是世界上最盛大的單日公益募款活動，同時也是最難入選的「倫敦馬拉松」。


倫敦的「善」


跑步可以一個人跑，也可以是一群人跑；可以為自己而跑，更可以是為公益而跑。
這是頭一回，我跑起馬拉松感覺這麼有壓力。畢竟有這麼多好朋友們跟我一起做公閉兒機構，更讓我有機會帶著大家一起參與這項慈善馬拉松。（我立了根功德柱在結語〈灰象甘蝦羚打擂〉，大德們可別忘了去瞧瞧。）
在我的六大馬計畫中，倫敦馬本來是最後一塊拼圖，最快要到二○一八年才有機會完成。（原訂二○一四年東京初馬、二○一六年波士頓、柏林馬、二○一七年芝加哥、紐約馬，二○一八或二○一九年才是倫敦馬。）
然而，當我在二○一六年下半年知道二○一七年上半年有歐洲出差計畫後，我就開始改行當「編劇」了。跟大家一樣，我也報名了倫敦馬樂透，但畢竟台灣總是很少人樂得到、透得了。當不意外地收到不錄取通知時，我更是開始找尋其他的可能性，頻繁發信到亞洲其他有配合的旅行社詢問，也如預期所想，所有回信都直指「名額早被預訂了」。
不用想也知道，跑馬人哪有這麼輕易放棄的。最後我決定改走慈善路線，終於順利地拿下僅有的慈善席次。
藉由倫敦馬，我邀請親朋好友們一同來關懷台灣自閉兒和癌症病童，一起兼善、行善、揚善、樂善。不但有許多支持我的親朋好友們響應，更讓我感受到大家希望為公益付出的善念與行動。
因此，本來只是我的倫敦馬，因為大家的共襄盛舉而成了「我們的倫敦馬」。


芝加哥的「驚」


二○一六年我本來有個帶著全家前往美國半年的進修計畫，於是我以成績分別申請了二○一七年「芝加哥馬」與「紐約馬」，並獲取參賽資格。
起初覺得這個構想很完美，可以全家出遊，又能一兼二顧把六大馬完成。可是人算不如天算，後來因故取消了進修計畫。但想到自己都已經跑完六大馬的其中四個，頭都洗一半了，就把剩下兩顆頭洗完吧！
然而也因為進修計畫生變，反倒產生了一個困擾：「得在有時差的地方，連續兩個月跑馬」。這也是第一次嘗試將「全家國旗跑旅」移往具有明顯時差的國度。
然而最驚險的還在後頭，不小心被同行的枕邊人傳染感冒，憂慮的心情揮之不去。
我怕嗜睡不敢吃藥，而賽前一、兩天窮盡一切手段：線上求助醫生及友人、灌開水、吸蒸氣、吞維他命、補運動飲、包緊全身，就是希望全力壓住這位不速之客。幸好處置得宜，比賽前一天和當天呼吸道還算順暢，只餘下「濃濃的痰吐」跟「啞啞的談吐」。
連同著賽前感冒的驚魂，芝加哥賽道十九彎二十八拐的驚訝，賽道上數度受到急行而過的自行車驚嚇，天缺時地未利人不和竟然還能達成預定目標，我因而感到驚奇！
當然，還有帶著兩個小孩第一次跨足美國，歷程更是處處驚心動魄。
我最大的收穫，在於：「別只盯著外面，最大的對手永遠是自己，接著是自己人。」最後驚覺，人的潛能真的是無限啊！


紐約的「動」


我帶著興奮又期待的心情前往紐約，經過四年多的精實訓練，讓我在面對未知的挑戰仍保有充裕的自信。（或許唯一的隱憂來自於長期訓練下，身心持續累積的疲累。）
紐約馬剛起跑，就是個大上坡跑上「韋拉札諾海峽大橋」（Verrazano-Narrows Bridge），生涯十六次全馬中，從沒印象哪次像紐約馬一樣，才一開始雙腿就非常有感了。
我想這就是所謂的下馬威，紐約馬鐵了心，在一開始就給所有想親近它的跑者們下馬威。
過去的跑馬經驗裡，不論什麼狀況多少都曾遇過。當起跑後就感覺狀況不好時，倒不一定是壞事，反而會讓我們更謹慎以對。
賽前最該戒慎恐懼的，肯定是橫跨五個行政區總共五座連結橋樑。而等到親身上陣後，卻發現除了橋樑以外，一般道路坡度竟也常常「急轉直上」！馬拉松最後的12.195 公里往往是驗證功力高低的時候，而紐約大蘋果的最後12.195公里，同時也是我世界六大馬的最後12.195公里，更是挑戰重重。
除了後面仍有「威利斯大道橋」（Willis Ave. Bridge）及「麥迪遜大道大橋」（Madison Ave. Bridge）兩座橋靜靜地等候著我們，中央公園周遭的高低起伏更像極了顆不定時炸彈，隨時準備引爆跑者疲憊的雙腳。也因此，東九十街即將轉入中央公園前，有右側詩意、左側過億的第五大道，整條路段看來極其浪漫，但沿途坡度一路向上，跑來卻極其緩慢。

在當天選手村漫長等待的冷冽抖動，前後五座橋對意志的無限撼動，以及沿途加油群眾的慷慨激動，到最後順利完賽、取得世界六大馬六星排列成「蜜糖波堤」的莫名感動，至今仍深深刻劃在心底。
二○一七年紐約馬的標語是「It will move you.」著實明顯適用於任何自虐的行徑或處境。
毛毛細雨間，我掛著六星「蜜糖波堤」，獨自漫步於紐約馬終點線後，披著完賽斗篷緩緩走出中央公園的路上，我不時仰望天空，品嘗一種專屬自己卻又不僅僅屬於自己的滿足感。
我不是歸人，也不是過客，我是個跑者；
一個已完成自己以及許多親朋好友期待的六星跑者。

""Go to the bottom of your life"": From the ignorant runner to the world's six horses, I am completing the ""impossible"" step by step.
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is the people who run the marathon. At the same time, the information search ability will be greatly improved. In the process of continuous training, I have a deeper understanding of the world's six major marathons, including Tokyo, Berlin, London, Chicago, New York, and the world's oldest, and the most marathon of all serious amateur runners to participate in: Boston Marathon.



Text: Wang Guanxiang
Talk about it, why do you want to run the world's six horses?
""Why do you want to run the world's six marathons?""
Before answering this question, I have to talk about why I started running the marathon.
In the case of ""horse race"", everyone has their own cause or philosophy, reasonable, absurd, moving, and stupid. After all, in the face of this tormenting process, a runner who is physically and mentally normal, regardless of How to find out some reasons to rationalize or hypnotize yourself.
The same is true of my jogging path.
The death of my mother is undoubtedly the far cause. I thought that after taking all the time with my busy work, time will take everything away, but I didn’t expect the mood to last for a long time. I have long been unaware of the ""chaos"" (Limbo) described in the film ""Inception"", which is not dead or alive, stuck in the border of nothing, for life, moving and enthusiasm no longer . However, I am not alone. Not only do I have a father and a wife, but also a pair of children. I can’t help myself to hide in the dark space of my own construction. I hope that I can do some stupid things. Everything is good, as long as I can lead myself. Leave chaos.
As for the near cause, it is like many people, encountering a crisis of aging, metabolic degradation, and constant weight evolution. It happened that a friend gave me a sports wear device during my birthday in 2013. When I was lucky and made a chance, I started this stupid thing.
When you really desire, the whole universe will unite to help you.
I have never been able to open the box when I received the gift. It has been so delayed for four months. I always feel that it is not good for my friends. Moreover, the crisis mentioned above is still raging. Finally, in August of the same year, I finally made up my mind to start regular jogging exercises.
It is also strange to say that running is like ""catch-up"". Someone will always tell you what kind of competition you want to register and what road you want to run. Due to the marginal meeting, a group of people signed up for the ""Tokyo Marathon Lotto"" in 2014. In the early days, the Tokyo horse did not need a ""personality"" guarantee, and we were fortunate enough to win. Originally, I did not pay special attention to the Tokyo Horse, because before the Tokyo Horse, we also arranged the scenic ""Tarouge Marathon"" as a simulation of the Tokyo Maqian. However, God seems to have any intentions. It was actually destroyed before the Taroko Marathon in 2013. The successor was taken for granted. The Tokyo Horse unexpectedly took the place and became my first horse. Later, I thought about it. This is undoubtedly the most beautiful accident.
In 2014, in order to participate in the early days of Tokyo, I was prepared to be fully prepared. I also specially prepared 36 flag packs for my friends and family, and gathered a group of four families to form a world-class aid group. Going to Tokyo, in addition to helping me to add fuel, I also took the opportunity to help Taiwan expose. More importantly, let the children participate in the whole process, experience the joyful atmosphere, recognize the hardships of the journey, and appreciate the beauty and embodiment of the movement. Taiwan can be omnipresent.
Since then, the trinity of ""Marathon"", ""Family Travel"" and ""Exposure Taiwan"" has become a way of life, leisure and education for our family. In 2014, the Naha Marathon, the 2015 Hokkaido Marathon, and the 2017 Chicago Marathon were all the best practices of the ""Family Flag Run"".
After I was alone and trained for a total of 1,04 kilometers in eight months, I completed the first horse in Tokyo! The implicit ambition and explicit appearance are natural, but the wife does not seem to pay much attention to my personal breakthrough. After the game, she confessed that my Tokyo horse ""runs too long, runs too Slow, and the resulting international-level gas station led by her led in the cold wind for nearly fifteen minutes.
As the saying goes: ""The scholars meet the soldiers and they can't reasonably tell.""
""Oh, my God!"" I was simply ""the soldiers encountered the talents, 42.195 kilometers could not be clarified."" Although I finally completed the early Tokyo horse in three hours and two fifty-four seconds, the joy of the heart was immediately poured. Quenching, deeply guilty, I also believe that I still have a lot of room for improvement. As the saying goes: ""Whether an unsuccessful man has a great woman behind him."" It is like a slap in the face, and he is really an epiphany.

The people who run the marathon will also improve their information search ability while improving their horsepower. In the process of continuous training, I have a deeper understanding of the world's six major marathons, including Tokyo, Berlin, London, Chicago, New York, and the world's oldest, and the most marathon of all serious amateur runners to participate in: Boston Marathon.
What else to think about next is of course to challenge yourself and look forward to participating in the 120th anniversary of the Boston Marathon in 2016. The idea of challenging the world's six horses is also beginning to sprout rapidly during this period. I began to dream, and I hope that I will complete them one by one before the age of forty-five, as a comma or an exclamation point of this grinding process!
Of course, as the wife is actively complaining, I have to try to get back to the end soon.
From my six horses to our six horses
From the ignorant and ignorant lonely runners to the completion of the world's six marathons, after three big horses in Tokyo, Boston and Berlin, everything is already halfway through. On the road, there have been many comrades who are quiet or moving, going up the mountain and going to the sea to work with me. Today I am gradually completing the impossible in my mind yesterday.
Mahatma Gandhi said: ""To transform the world, change yourself first."" I not only did this in a hurry, but also began to plan to continue the completion of the next three horses in different ways and angles. The next one is the world's largest single-day charity fundraiser, and the most difficult to be selected for the London Marathon.


London's ""good""


Running can be run by one person, or it can be run by a group of people; you can run for yourself, or run for charity.
This is the first time, I feel so stressed when I run the marathon. After all, there are so many good friends who have been working with me to be a public institution, and I have the opportunity to take everyone to participate in this charity marathon. (I set up the roots of the merits in the conclusion ""Gray like the squid squid"", the big Germans don't forget to go.)
In my six-horse plan, London horse is the last piece of the puzzle, and it will not be until the end of 2018. (Original bookings were made in Tokyo in early 2004, Boston in Boston, Berlin in 2017, Chicago in 2017, horses in New York, and London horses in 2018 or 2019.)
However, when I learned in the second half of 2016 that I had a European business trip in the first half of 2017, I started to change my career as a ""screenwriter."" Like everyone else, I also signed up for London Marathi, but after all, Taiwan is rarely enjoyed and thoroughly. When I did not accidentally receive the notice of no admission, I began to look for other possibilities. I frequently sent letters to other travel agencies in Asia to get inquiries. As expected, all the letters were directed to ""the number of places was booked."" "".""
Don't even think about it, the racer can easily give up. In the end, I decided to change the charity route and finally successfully won the only charity seats.
With the London Horse, I invite friends and family to take care of Taiwan's autistic children and cancer sick children, and to be good, good, good, and good. Not only do I have a lot of support from my friends and family, but I also feel the good thoughts and actions that everyone wants to do for the public good.
Therefore, it was only my London horse, because everyone's co-existence became ""our London horse.""


Chicago’s ""surprise""


In 2016, I originally had a study plan for the whole family to travel to the United States for half a year. So I applied for the ""Chicago Horse"" and ""New York Horse"" in 2017 and obtained the qualifications.
At first I felt that this idea was perfect, I could travel the whole family, and I could complete the six horses together. However, people are not as good as days, and later canceled the study plan for some reason. But I thought that I had already finished four of the six horses and washed half of the head. I washed the remaining two heads!
However, because of the changes in the training program, there has been a problem: ""There must be two months of running horses in a time-limited place."" This is also the first attempt to move the ""Family Flag Run"" to a country with significant time difference.
However, the most thrilling is still behind, accidentally being caught by the pillows of the peers, and the anxiety is lingering.
I am afraid that I can't take medicine when I sleep, and I do everything in one or two days before the game: online help doctors and friends, water, steam, swallow vitamins, make sports drinks, and wrap the whole body, I hope to press the uninvited guest. . Fortunately, it was well handled. The day before and the day of the game, the respiratory tract was smooth, leaving only the ""deep vomiting"" and ""dumb talk"".
Along with the horror of the pre-match cold, the Chicago circuit was amazed by the twists and turns of the 19th, and the number of times on the track was frightened by the bicycles that had been rushed by the road. When the time was short, the unsuccessful people could not reach the target. So surprised!
Of course, with two children for the first time in the United States, the journey is even more thrilling.
My biggest achievement is: ""Don't just stare at the outside, the biggest opponent is always yourself, then your own."" Finally, I was shocked that the potential of people is really unlimited!


New York’s ""moving""


I traveled to New York with excitement and expectation. After more than four years of intensive training, I still have plenty of confidence in facing the unknown challenges. (Perhaps the only hidden worry comes from the long-term training, the accumulation of physical and mental fatigue.)
New York Ma Gang just started running, it was a big uphill run on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. He had never been impressed with a New York horse for sixteen times. It is very sensational.
I think this is the so-called Mawei, the New York Ma Tie, and at the beginning gave all the runners who want to get close to it.
In the past horse racing experience, I have encountered any situation. When you feel bad when you start, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but it will make us more cautious.
The most fearful fear before the game is definitely a total of five bridges across five administrative districts. After waiting for the pro-in faction, it was found that in addition to the bridge, the slope of the road was often ""suddenly turned up""! The final 12.195 kilometers of the marathon is often the time to verify the skill level, while the last 12.195 kilometers of the New York Big Apple and the last 12.195 kilometers of the six major horses in the world are even more challenging.
In addition to the two bridges of Willis Ave. Bridge and Madison Ave. Bridge waiting quietly behind us, the heights and undulations around Central Park are even more extreme. An untimely bomb, ready to detonate the tired feet of the runner. As a result, East Kowloon Street is about to be transferred to Central Park. There is a poetry on the right, and the fifth avenue on the left is over 100 million. The whole section looks extremely romantic, but the slope along the way is all up, but it is extremely slow.

On the same day, the villagers waited for the long-awaited cold-blooded jitter, the infinite movement of the five bridges before and after, and the generous excitement of the refueling people along the way. In the end, they successfully completed the race and won the world's six horses and six stars arranged into ""Honey Waves"". The inexplicable touch is still deeply rooted in my heart.
The slogan of the New York Horse in 2017 is ""It will move you."" It is clearly applicable to any act or situation of self-abuse.
In the drizzle, I hung a six-star ""Honey Wave"", walked alone at the finish line of the New York Horse, and draped the cloak slowly out of Central Park. I looked up at the sky from time to time and tasted an exclusive self. Not only is it a sense of satisfaction.
I am not a person, nor a passenger, I am a runner;
A six-star runner who has completed himself and many friends and family.

The only thing I want to conquer is the arena in my heart... From stupid to challenging the world's six marathons, ""The fastest general manager"" Wang Guanxiang tells him that he is beautiful, sour, scared, hungry and shocked! Like total: ""In running, I learned to run all the way, fly, challenge my limits, and challenge my infinite possibilities.""

Wang Guanxiang, a naughty boy from the edge of Taipei's city, ""Fang Lan"", has been running in the mountains since childhood, catching fish in the creek.

The lost man is in the bottom of his life, and he is confronted with a serious crisis of aging, metabolic degradation and weight gain. On his birthday in 2013, his friend sent him a sports wear device, and he made a good opportunity and made a chance. He was destined to ""run"" the stupid thing in many people, and he also picked him up. The life that comes down brings motivation and change.
After opening the exercise device and self-training for eight months, after accumulating a thousand kilometers, Wang Guanxiang, who is called the ""same speed general manager"", completed his early Tokyo horse. In the next four years and three months, he successively completed world-renowned marathons such as Boston, Berlin, London, Chicago, and New York, and hanged six-star ""Honey Waves"" to become the world's six marathon Taiwan's fastest runners!
He wore a national flag, raised the national flag and rushed to the finish line, let Taiwan be seen at the international marathon track; turned the ability to pursue speed into a shared public interest, led the ""reward day"", and let more people start running and running. Better; invest more in your own resources, launch the ""Guo Shouhui"" brand accelerator, multi-reform the long-distance runners and sports culture development!

The only constant is that you have to step by step and step by step, passing a test and constantly facing each other in the mirror. At the stage, he said: ""Yes, you can make it!"" So, he began to write this book is not just about running, talking about the world's six horses, but also talking about yourself, talking about the world and talking about sentient beings.
