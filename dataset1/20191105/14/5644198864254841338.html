      <p>SINGAPORE: Around 136,000 - or 16 per cent - of eligible Singaporeans maxed out their Flexi-MediSave limit of S$200 in 2018, said Senior Minister of State for Health Edwin Tong on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>This was in response to a Parliamentary question by MP Saktiandi Supaat, who asked for the number of eligible Central Provident Fund (CPF) members who used up their Flexi-MediSave limit in the past year.</p>

      <p>The Flexi-MediSave allows Singaporeans aged 60 and above to withdraw S$200 from their MediSave accounts each year to pay for outpatient medical treatments at specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS).</p>
      <p>Mr Saktiandi also asked whether the Ministry of Health (MOH) would consider reviewing the limit for older members who require frequent outpatient treatments.</p>
      <p>In response, Mr Tong said that MOH cannot just "look at the affordability, but also at the longer-term sustainability in the use of the MediSave".</p>
      <p>Since more than eight in 10 Singaporeans do not use the full limit of the Flexi-MediSave, "that gives us an indication as to where we have scoped it and that right sizing of that amount at this juncture", he added.</p>
      <p>"MOH regularly reviews our healthcare financing schemes, including Flexi-MediSave," said Mr Tong, who pointed to several adjustments made over the past two years which allowed more people to benefit.</p>
      <p>In August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced at the National Day Rally that <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ndr-2018-chas-subsidy-scheme-singaporeans-chronic-conditions-10631428">the CHAS scheme will cover all with chronic condition</a>s regardless of income. </p>
      <p>This will be done through the new CHAS green tier, said Mr Tong.</p>
      <p>The Merdeka Generation package also provides subsidies for members' outpatient treatments at CHAS clinics, polyclinics and public specialist outpatient clinics, he added.</p>
      <p>Last year, MOH <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/medisave-withdrawal-limit-for-chronic-disease-vaccinations-10022422">lowered the minimum age</a> to qualify for Flexi-MediSave, from 65 to 60 years. </p>
      <p>The ministry also raised the MediSave withdrawal limit for outpatient vaccinations, health screening and chronic disease management from S$400 to S$500.</p>
      <p>Mr Tong also responded to a question by WP MP Pritam Singh, who suggested allowing members in the upper tier of their MediSave account to withdraw additional sums for outpatient treatment.</p>
      <p>"I think overall the objective is to ensure that the amounts are correctly-sized, and I would also suggest that those who may have exhausted the Flexi-MediSave amounts might also consider that there are other schemes in tandem with it.</p>
      <p>"Just because you have Flexi-MediSave withdrawal limits reached or maxed out does not mean you can’t also deploy other schemes," he said.</p>
