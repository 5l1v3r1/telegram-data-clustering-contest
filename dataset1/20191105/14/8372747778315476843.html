      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- The WWE is bringing WrestleMania 36 to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa next year, but you will be able to get tickets on a special pre-sale next week.</p>
      <p>The event was announced in March, revealing that the latest WrestleMania will take place on April 5, 2020, and will include a week-long celebration in Tampa.</p>
      <p>Other activities planned include, WrestleMania Axxess, WWE’s interactive fan festival, as well as four nights of events; SmackDown® Live; 2020 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony; NXT® TakeOver™ and Monday Night Raw®. WWE will also host more than a dozen community outreach events, including hospital visits and Be a STAR® bullying prevention rallies, designed to give back to the local region, according to a press release.</p>
      <p>"This is truly the biggest event our community has ever coveted but hasn't had the chance to host," said Executive Director Tampa Bay Sports Commission Rob Higgins.</p>
      <p>The general public on-sale is scheduled for Friday, November 15th at 10 a.m.. However, we have a special link to gain access to a pre-sale beginning Wednesday, November 13th at 10 a.m.</p>
