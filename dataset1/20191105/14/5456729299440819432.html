      <h1>I never believed military coup was possible in Nigeria - Gowon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:36:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/361119-i-never-believed-military-coup-was-possible-in-nigeria-gowon.html" target="_blank">Kabir Yusuf</a></address>
      <p>Nigeria’s second military ruler, Yakubu Gowon, says he did not believe a military coup could take place in Nigeria until the first one on January 15, 1966.</p>
      <p>After that initiation which brought in Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi as the first military Head of State, Nigeria experienced five other successful coups and many aborted ones before the birth of the Fourth Republic in 1999.</p>
      <p>Mr Gowon became Head of State after Mr Aguiyi-Ironsi was killed in the counter-coup of July 29, 1966. The coup was staged by junior military officers from the northern region of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The officers said the coup was to avenge the killing of many northern and Yoruba political leaders and military officers in the earlier putsch.</p>
      <p>Recalling the series of events that ended with him becoming Head of State before his 32nd birthday in 1966, Mr Gowon said he thought “it was impossible” to have a coup in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He spoke a day after his 85th birthday on October 20 at a ceremony in Abuja where he was honoured with a `Lifetime Achievement Award` and Patron of the Civil Youth Society Group.</p>
      <p>Until the political upheavals and military rebellion catapulted him into power, Mr Gowon was a career soldier and had no involvement in politics.</p>
      <p>“I had no ambition to go beyond reaching my zenith in my military career but certain development came through that I never thought of,” he said after receiving the award in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Mr Gowon remembered his encounters with foreigners while returning to Nigeria by sea shortly before the coup of January 1966.</p>
      <p>“When I was coming back from the UK after taking one of my senior courses and I decided to take a holiday before coming home, of course, you never knew what could happen and upon my arrival, people were asking me silly questions,” he recalled.</p>
      <p>“We were not political in the army and not trained to get involved in that aspect. But if such a thing happened and honestly, this was asked by most of the nationalities: the English, the Scot, Britain, people from West Africa and others from Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Even some Nigerians onboard had to ask me, after the coup in Central Africa and West Africa, ‘what of Nigeria?’</p>
      <p>“So I said to them, ‘let me not be a philosopher. Nothing is impossible in this world but if such a thing happens in Nigeria, I hope the few loyal ones amongst us will deal with the situation and return the status quo.’”</p>
      <h4>Nigerian Civil War</h4>
      <p>Mr Gowon was Nigeria`s head of state for nine years covering the deadly Nigerian civil war which lasted 30 months and caused the death of thousands of Nigerians and dislocation of millions of others.</p>
      <p>On the civil war, he said the Nigerian Army under his command fought “under a very strict code of conduct.”</p>
      <p>He recalled the remarks by a Red Cross official that ‘Nigeria fought the war better than obeying the Geneva Convention’, “because I can assure you there was strict instruction on how the war was going to be fought against those who had taken up arms against the country remaining one Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“That was (the reason) why we protected people, women and children and even anyone that should be treated as a Nigerian; and this was what we wanted,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said Nigerians and his government had nothing against the Igbo.</p>
      <p>The massacre of the Igbo people in some northern cities was the main reason the then governor of the then Eastern Region, Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, cited for declaring the secession of the region as the Republic of Biafra.</p>
      <p>“That is why when the war ended, we did not glorify the victory over defeated people,” Mr Gowon said.</p>
      <p>After the unconditional surrender of the Biafran rebels in January 1970, Mr Gowon declared that the war produced ‘No Victor, No Vanquished.’</p>
      <p>“The victor was Nigeria, that has now remained one and united,” Mr Gowon said. “If I want to give glory to God, I will say ‘God, thank you, we remain united after 50 years and I hope we will be united for another 50 years and more to come.”</p>
