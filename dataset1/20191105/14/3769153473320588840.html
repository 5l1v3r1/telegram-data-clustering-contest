      <blockquote>Kirby Blender Rig Version 4 was made thanks to all the support and downloads from the previous version! This character rig allows you to pose and/or animate Kirby to your heart's content. With easy to use and understand controls, bringing Kirby to life has never been easier.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this rig is to create beautiful renders with Kirby. It's the difference between using an in-game model ripped from the game itself to make a render, and using a model that was made for cinematics and rendering.<br/><br/>Save time on modeling Kirby yourself, and start making your own animations now!</blockquote>
