      <p>(CNN) - A brave black cat took to the field during Monday's Cowboys-Giants NFL football game to show off his sprints, delaying the game as he scurried all over MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>Players and coaches stood on the sidelines during the second quarter, watching as the fluffy feline showed them how it's really done.</p>
      <p>Refusing to look foolish in front of a stadium of delighted fans, the cat zigzagged across the turf, avoiding capture.</p>
      <p>"He has great lateral movement," commented Joe Tessitore, an ESPN commentator.</p>
      <p>Pursued by New Jersey state troopers, the feline darted toward the end zone. Westwood One Sports radio announcer Kevin Harlan kept going with his play-by-play commentary as the cat darted to-and-fro on the field.</p>
      <p>"A state trooper has come on the field and the cat runs into the end zone. That is a touchdown!" Harlan yelled as the crowd in the stands roared with excitement.</p>
      <p>After successfully evading the state trooper defensive line, the cat slipped into a tunnel and disappeared into the night. At the time, the Giants were winning 9-3.</p>
      <p>It was quite an ominous appearance, especially for the Giants, who ended up losing 37-18. Perhaps they should have paid a little closer attention to the cat's slick evasion strategies.</p>
