內地經濟增速放緩，新公布的10月官方製造業採購經理指數（PMI）回落至今年2月以來最低，9月工業企業利潤數據亦遜預期，而今年第三季的國內生產總值（GDP）同比增長6％，創下27年來的新低。

內銀季績普遍勝預期
不過，縱觀在港上市的大型中資銀行發布的季報則普遍勝預期，這與人民銀行透過多項措施刺激銀行放貸，以保障經濟穩定增長有關。今年首三季，內地銀行業用於實體經濟的貸款增加13.9萬億元人民幣，按年增加近8%，重點投向基礎設施、製造業等重點領域，以及民營小微企業。其中，五大內銀小微企貸款餘額較去年底增加逾8,000億元人民幣，增幅近48%。上週四大內銀公布季績，除中國銀行（03988）第三季純利僅增長4%遜預期外，其他三家大行第三季利潤增速均錄得5%以上增長，高於上半年。三季度資產擴張加速，其中工商銀行（01398）總資產規模突破30萬億元人民幣，較2018年末增長9.84%，前三季度貸款及墊款總額新增1.24萬億元人民幣，較去年末增長8.05%；投資比上年末增加7,003億元人民幣，升10.37%。
同期建設銀行（00939）、中行、農業銀行（01288）的貸款增速，分別達7.9%、9.5%、11.57%。今年8月，人民銀行更改貸款市場報價利率（LPR）形成機制，令淨息差受壓，但內銀淨利息收入仍錄得增長，資產素質改善情況亦不俗。截至第三季末，建行不良貸款率為1.43%，按季持平；中行不良貸款率為1.37%，按季下跌0.03個百分點；工行和農行分別下跌0.04個百分點和0.01個百分點。總體而言，內銀第三季表現平穩，淨息差收窄情況可控，此前板塊超賣已久，預計近期股價可持續反彈，首選龍頭建行。
香港銀行股價續受壓
此外，本港銀行也陸續公布業績，受美國減息、國際貿易環境不確定性增加、以及本地社會氛圍影響，香港經濟下行壓力較大，銀行首當其衝。滙豐控股（00005）此前發布第三季業績，稅前盈利大跌18%至48億美元，遜預期，而香港地區業務在第三季損失4億美元，並增加7億港元撥備。假設社會運動持續，對本港零售、樓價及就業均會帶來打擊，主打本地業務的恒生銀行（00011）將面臨嚴峻挑戰，料股價持續受壓。
至於中銀香港（02388）三季度撥備前經營溢利109.6億元，按年升12.3%。季內，撥備前淨經營收入151億元，按年升11.3%，經營支出則按年升8.7%，淨息差按季擴闊1個基點。由於中銀香港的收入來源較多元化，料有能力維持派息，今年5月始該股股價持續走跌，目前息率有5.45厘，可小注博反彈。

Good results for the internal banking industry. Hong Kong Bank is not clear! BOC Hong Kong has over 5 cents interest. Small note rebounds | Chen Jinxing

The economic growth rate in the Mainland slowed down. The newly announced official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) in October fell back to the lowest since February this year. The industrial enterprise profit data in September was also worse than expected, and the third quarter of this year's GDP ( GDP) increased by 6% year-on-year, setting a new low in 27 years.

The internal banking performance is generally better than expected
However, the quarterly reports issued by large Chinese banks listed in Hong Kong generally outperformed expectations, which is related to the PBOC's efforts to stimulate bank lending through various measures to ensure stable economic growth. In the first three quarters of this year, loans from the mainland banking industry for the real economy increased by 13.9 trillion yuan, up nearly 8% year-on-year, with a focus on key areas such as infrastructure and manufacturing, as well as private small and micro enterprises. Among them, the balance of the five major domestic banks' small and micro enterprise loans increased by more than 800 billion yuan from the end of last year, an increase of nearly 48%. Last Thursday, the Bank of China announced its quarterly results. Except for the third quarter net profit of Bank of China (03988), which only grew by 4%, the growth rate of the other three major banks in the third quarter increased by more than 5%, higher than the first half. . In the third quarter, asset expansion accelerated. Among them, ICBC (01398)'s total assets exceeded 30 trillion yuan, an increase of 9.84% from the end of 2018. The total loans and advances in the first three quarters increased by 1.24 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.05 compared with the end of last year. %; investment increased by RMB 700.3 billion or 10.37% from the end of the previous year.
In the same period, the growth rate of loans of China Construction Bank (00939), Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China (01288) reached 7.9%, 9.5% and 11.57% respectively. In August this year, the People's Bank of China changed the loan market quotation rate (LPR) formation mechanism, which caused the net interest margin to be under pressure. However, the net interest income of the Bank of China still recorded growth, and the improvement of asset quality was also good. As of the end of the third quarter, CCB's non-performing loan ratio was 1.43%, which was flat on a quarterly basis. BOC's non-performing loan ratio was 1.37%, down by 0.03 percentage points quarter-to-quarter; ICBC and ABC fell by 0.04 percentage points and 0.01 percentage points respectively. Overall, the Bank of China’s third-quarter performance was stable, and the narrowing of the net interest margin was controllable. The sector has been oversold for a long time. It is expected that the stock price will continue to rebound in the near future.
Hong Kong Bank's share price continues to be under pressure
In addition, Hong Kong banks have also announced their performances. Due to the interest rate cuts in the United States, the increasing uncertainty of the international trading environment, and the local social atmosphere, Hong Kong's economic downturn is greater, and banks are the first to bear the brunt. HSBC Holdings (00005) previously released its third-quarter results, with pre-tax profit plummeting 18% to US$4.8 billion, which was worse than expected, while Hong Kong's business lost US$400 million in the third quarter and increased its provision of HK$700 million. Assuming that the social movement continues, it will hit Hong Kong's retail, property prices and employment. Hang Seng Bank (00011), which focuses on local business, will face severe challenges, and its stock price continues to be under pressure.
As for BOC Hong Kong (02388), the operating profit before provision for the third quarter was 10.96 billion yuan, up 12.3% year-on-year. During the quarter, the net operating income before provisioning was 15.1 billion yuan, up 11.3% year-on-year, while operating expenses rose 8.7% year-on-year. The net interest margin widened by one basis point quarter-to-quarter. As BOC Hong Kong's income source is more diversified, it is expected to maintain dividends. Since May this year, the stock price has continued to fall. At present, the interest rate is 5.45%, which can rebound.
