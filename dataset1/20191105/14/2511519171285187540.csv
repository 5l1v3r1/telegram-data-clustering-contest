Banksy: Street artist’s 2008 mural uncovered in London’s Notting Hill
Artwork was obscured by scaffolding 11 years ago

A mural by mysterious street artist Banksy has been uncovered in Notting Hill.
The artwork – depicting an artist with an easel writing “Banksy” in big red letters – has been obscured by scaffolding on the corner of Acklam and Portobello Road since 2008.
It has several names, including The Graffiti Painter, The Painter or Velazquez, after Spanish artist Diego Velazquez.
Speaking about the piece ahead of its unveiling, Simon Lyons – capital chief executive of Enstar, the company behind the refurbishment – told Reuters: “It is a lovely feature for the building and a lovely feature in Notting Hill, which has retained its Londonness.”
He said the mural was “one of the reasons [he] bought the building,” adding that it gave the luxury flats “that iconic profile”.
Ahead of the building works, Enstar considered moving the artwork but decided there was too much risk. It’ll stay in the same spot, but will be floodlit and covered by glass.


The mural, unveiled in Notting Hill, was hidden for 10 years (Reuters)

Last month, behind-the-scenes photos showing the elusive Banksy at work were revealed by his former agent and driver, the photographer Steve Lazarides.
The photographs appear in a new book titled Banksy Captured.
