      <h1>Dark Souls Modders Make Custom Map Breakthrough</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:25:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>The Dark Souls modding community has made a major breakthrough that could bring player-made maps to the game. Last night, modder Dropoff uploaded a video documenting a test of the game’s first-ever custom map.</p>
      <p>The community’s first offering is inspired by Crossfire, a multiplayer map from the original <i>Half-Life</i>. As a result, it’s relatively simplistic, and doesn’t really capture the fantasy setting of the Souls Games. According to modder Katalash on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/drqwt6/modders_meowmaritus_and_horkrux_have_figured_out/">Reddit</a>, however, it’s still a major breakthrough.</p>

      <p>Previously, modders had worked out how to import models to the game, but had been unable to replicate the collision required to ensure the player didn’t fall through the map. Now, the community has used an old version of FromSoftware’s own modified version of physics engine Havok to generate a form of collision that works with Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition and Dark Souls 2.</p>
      <p>While that makes for a map you can actually run around, there’s still a long way to go. Katalash goes on to explain that enemies will need their own tools to enable them to move around, so “while this is an exciting first step, [...] it will take some time before easily created custom maps are fully a thing.” So no fan-made remaster of <i>Demon’s Souls</i> for a while, then.</p>
