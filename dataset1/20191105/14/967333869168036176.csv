Several EU countries (including Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia) previously said they wanted to participate in the project.
The TurkStream twin-pipeline will have a maximum capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres (1.1 trillion cubic feet) per year.
The first leg will deliver Russian gas under the Black Sea to Turkey for local consumption by 1 January 2020. The second leg is expected to carry gas to Southern and Central Europe, but its route has not been determined yet.
