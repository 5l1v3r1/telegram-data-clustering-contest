      <h1>Turkey claims it captured sister of Baghdadi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:28:35+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Turkey said it captured the sister of dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi during a raid in northern Syria.</p>
      <p>A senior Turkish official <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-turkey/turkey-captures-sister-of-dead-is-leader-in-syria-turkish-official-idUSKBN1XE2D3">told Reuters</a> that Rasmiya Awad, 65, her husband, and her daughter-in-law were detained Monday and are being interrogated. Awad was with five children when she was captured, the official said.</p>
      <p>“We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of ISIS,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director said the arrest of the woman proved Turkey was committed to fighting ISIS.</p>
      <p>“The arrest of al-Baghdadi’s sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations,” Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter early on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh,” he wrote, using another name for the terror group. “Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned.”</p>

      <p>Reuters was not able to verify that the woman who was detained was Baghdadi’s sister and little is known about her.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest, killing himself and three children, when he was cornered in an underground tunnel during a raid by U.S. special operations forces in northwestern Syria last month.</p>
