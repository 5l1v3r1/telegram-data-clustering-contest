      <h1>Grand Theft Auto maker hasn't paid corporation tax in 10 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:41:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>The UK-based game developer Rockstar North <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/29/grand-theft-auto-maker-uk-corporation-tax-rockstar-north-games">hasn't paid corporation tax in a decade despite scoring billions in revenue</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>A report from the investigative thinktank TaxWatch UK estimates Rockstar Games’ operating profit at $5bn (£4bn) between 2013 and 2019, during which time the company released Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar North is part of Rockstar Games. ... But the company paid no corporation tax between 2009 and 2018. It received £42m in tax credits from the government’s video games tax relief scheme, which was set up in 2014 to bolster the UK’s £5bn games industry, much of which is made up of small and medium-sized developers. The sum is equivalent to 19% of the total relief paid to the entire UK games industry since 2014, TaxWatch reports.</blockquote>
      <p>The fact that they've claimed public funds while (legally) avoiding taxation really drives the point home.</p>
      <p>A model version of this wheeze:</p>
      <p>Company A is in Nation X. Company B is in Nation Y. Company B agrees to pay Company A $10m for the rights to Company A's intellectual property. Company B makes $5m on the resulting product. Company B owes $10m, so it reports a loss to Nation Y's taxman. Company A never gets the $10m it's owed, so reports a loss to Nation X's taxman.</p>
      <p>The twist: Company B is owned by Company A, and may even trade under the same damn name.</p>
      <p>The question: Where is the $5m revenue?</p>
      <p>The answer used to be "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">an Irish bank</a>," but times change.</p>
