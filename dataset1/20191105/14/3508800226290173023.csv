《編輯這種病》： 假如作家內心存在著傷口， 我就朝那裡開刀
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是以我的做法，假如他們內心存在著傷口，我就朝那裡開刀，即使他們百般痛苦，仍會要求他們寫出來。做到這個程度，作家們才有機會將自己最真實的內在生命呈現在世人面前。



文：見城徹
與其墨守成規，不如魯莽衝撞
「書賣不出去，責任不在我。」我覺得出版人的這種慣常心態，才真的是胡搞。
從成立幻冬舍以來，我的行事風格始終如一，總向媒體或社會大眾丟出驚人之語，例如「你竟然沒聽過夏目漱石！」以標榜自己的隨興和莽撞。事實上，在經營出版我自認非常認真而細心。驕傲一點地說，我在經營人際關係上可是非同小可，而且我對此感到非常自豪。
我和作家或寫手們的情誼絕非普通編輯可比擬。創作這種東西，絕不是現代化科技能夠取代的。正因為這個世上仍然有科學、醫學、藥學、電腦或電子學無法解決的問題，才會有藝文創作的存在。因此，設若找醫生打針可以把病治好，那就去找醫生。正因為醫藥沒辦法完全治療心病，人才想要創作。而我們身為編輯或出版人的工作，就是設法提供這些創作者協助。無論是作家或音樂家，抑或是默默無名的新銳，我總是會與他們在同一陣線交手，藉此讓他們把內心的祕密，或者正感到困惑的煩憂書寫出來。
以我的做法，假如他們內心存在著傷口，我就朝那裡開刀，即使他們百般痛苦，仍會要求他們寫出來。做到這個程度，作家們才有機會將自己最真實的內在生命呈現在世人面前。對我來說，與作家交手的重點在於，你是否願意深入對方的內心來個近身肉搏。若無法在對方的靈魂深處激戰，就無法成就精采的創作。從事這個工作就得遵循這個法則，才可能有所成就。畢竟我們的工作是將人的精神活動製作成商品，說來是個非常捉摸難測的差事。
以《弟弟》一書為例，我若跟石原慎太郎沒有任何交情，而要請他寫這本書，再怎麼勸說他也不會答應。我向來是石原慎太郎的忠實讀者，對他有某種程度的了解，加上我們有20多年的交情，以這種關係和背景做基礎，才可能發展出「我就相信見城的說法，試著寫寫看吧」這樣的結果。作家們可以透過書寫而得到治療、救贖和解放，正因為他們在書中傳達了這種訊息，才得以打動讀者。至於「因為有此宣傳效果，那本書才會暢銷」的說法，都是事後諸葛。
其實，每次與作家交手的時候，自己的生命態度都是受到質疑的，而他們也會顯現出自己的真性情與缺點，因此編輯必須透過這樣的內在激盪，才得以將人的精神產物轉化為商品，畢竟人的精神產物是有生命的。
所以啊，我們身為編輯想要讓工作進展順利，除了抱著必死的決心懇求作家之外，實在別無他法了。我只教導屬下一件事情，「倘若你不願意與作家分享你人生中的重要大事，那麼你不僅無法說服作家，也不可能讓他們為你做任何付出。」確切地說，我要他們用自己生命的重量和作家交往。
與作家交手沒有什麼訣竅可言，非得自己用心體會不可。如果自己不願意對人家掏心掏肺，雙方的交流就不會有結果。編輯不吐露自己內心的糾葛，卻要作家只對你這傢伙坦誠相見，簡直是天方夜譚！我認為這是人際關係的根本。當我計畫贏得某位作家的青睞，我就會賭上我的生命徹底付出。徹底閱讀對方的所有著作，花一整個星期的時間，將我的請求化為文字，大約寫滿十張信紙。我總是告訴自己，「對方讀完這些信，還能不答應我的請求才奇怪。」
出版界人士說：「藝文相關的書籍很難賺錢、書很難賣，社會讀書人口銳減是主要的原因。」他們還說現在出版業不景氣，也是肇因於嚴峻的經濟環境。現在「編輯也必須了解讀者和市場，成敗的真正關鍵在於編輯能否擁有業務員的敏感度。」竟成為出版界的通用說法。我則想說，發什麼神經病啊，事情才不是這樣的。書賣得不好，完全是出版界的責任。正因為無法用生命和作家坦誠交流，才製作不出打動讀者的好書。
出版社甫成立不久，我便決定在報紙上刊登全版廣告，無論是讓《Daddy》一書成為驚爆獨家內幕的媒體，而且初版就印50萬本，或是幻冬舍文庫一口氣就推出62本新書搶攻市場，都是我莽撞行動的壯舉，而且還成功地創造出百萬暢銷書和經典好書。所以說書籍賣不出去，和景氣沒有絕對關係吧。把書的滯銷歸咎於景氣低迷，這種想法才最有問題。換句話說，將這種想法視為理所當然而不知自我檢討的編輯或出版人，他們那種消極心態才是問題所在。
毋庸置疑，編輯當然要有業務員的敏感度。成敗的關鍵通常取決於這種顯而易見的事實。依我看來，出版人和編輯不能面對現實情況，並負起自己應負的責任，還為如此狼狽的自己辯護，才真的是魯莽而有欠斟酌，等到自己變成那種不問到底為什麼會造成眼前的局勢，只會默默承受，甚至將有欠斟酌的常規奉為圭臬的人，那才真的是為時已晚，因為那些常規早已跟現實嚴重脫節。
要突破這種消極的常規，必須加倍魯莽才能成功，因此我和幻冬舍只能更魯莽地衝撞原有的常規體制，畢竟以其人之道還治其人之身才有勝算。「初出茅廬的新手，若不敢魯莽衝撞，還能妄想帶來什麼改變？」這句話所指的闖盪，並不只是單純地代表我們公司在出版界的魯莽闖蕩，而是鼓勵大家要勇敢衝撞那些不負責任的常規陋習。我認為事物的本質日新月盛，而只有在我們願意用生命全心去追尋，事物的本質才會昭然立現。這個道理並不只侷限在如何衝高書的銷量，一個社會同樣必須以這種認真的態度運作，才有可能進步和開創新局。我就是抱持這種信念在經營出版事業。
賣書與用生命和作家交陪並不矛盾。業務和編輯的工作也不互相衝突。
對我而言，暢銷的書就是好書。有人會質疑，那麼好書就只是如此而已嗎？其實，所謂好書的定義很廣泛。作者和編輯都覺得自己已完成意義非凡的工作，自視甚高地出版了這本書，結果卻賣不出去也無可奈何。最理想的狀況是，書寫得好又暢銷熱賣，要是兩者皆落空最令人扼腕。用差不多的心態編製書籍，最終只能得出「差不多」的結果。編輯和作者要追求的是，該書是否能暢銷，抑或是內容精采可期，或者是兩者兼具？
以我個人而言，我只想製作我和作家都覺得精采的作品。舉例來說，其實《兩個人》的書稿早在出版的一年前即已完成，對方若想出版的話，隨時可以付印。可是唐澤壽明和我都不滿意。唐澤那時候是當紅的俊俏小生，那本書上市後要賣出10萬本左右應該不成問題。話說回來，與人共事倘若最後讓對方覺得「悔不當初」的話，那以後就不可能再有合作機會。即使最後賣出10萬本的成績，但讓對方不想再與你共事，那就是編輯最大的失敗。
因此，雖然那時候我們公司剛成立，相當缺錢，我還是硬著頭皮對唐澤說，書不急著出版沒關係，將《兩個人》的出版日期延後。結果後來唐澤和山口智子結婚，這本書抓住這個契機，成為熱賣百萬本的暢銷書。比起當初我們公司可能直接進帳的百萬日圓，3年後換得的卻是1億日圓，決策的正確與否已經非常明顯。
簡單地說，不要急著得到結果。以我的經驗來看，編輯必須與作家建立緊密的交情，然後對其作品仔細斟酌、看準時機出版，最後必定有銷售佳績。書籍要出版，當然就得暢銷才行，而賣書以及用生命和作家交陪，與業務和編輯這兩種工作並不衝突。

""Editing the disease"": If there is a wound in the writer's heart, I will go there
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is my approach. If there is a wound in their heart, I will go there and even if they are suffering, they will still be asked to write it. To achieve this level, writers have the opportunity to present their true inner life to the world.



Text: See the city
It’s better to be rude than to be rude
""The book can't be sold, the responsibility is not mine."" I think the publisher's usual mentality is really a fool.
Since the establishment of the Fantasy Winter House, my style of action has always been the same, always throwing amazing words to the media or the public, such as ""You have never heard of Natsume Soseki!"" to flaunt your own happiness and rash. In fact, I believe in business publishing very seriously and carefully. I am proud to say that I am very good at managing interpersonal relationships, and I am very proud of it.
My friendship with writers or writers is no match for ordinary editors. Creating such things is by no means a replacement for modern technology. Just because there are still problems in the world that cannot be solved by science, medicine, pharmacy, computer or electronics, there will be the existence of art and literature. Therefore, if you find a doctor to get a good shot, then go to the doctor. Because medicine can't completely cure heart disease, talents want to create. And our job as an editor or publisher is to try to provide assistance from these creators. Whether it's a writer or a musician, or a silent newcomer, I will always be with them on the same front, so that they can write their inner secrets or worrying puzzles.
In my case, if there is a wound in their heart, I will open a knife there, even if they are suffering, they will still be asked to write it. To achieve this level, writers have the opportunity to present their true inner life to the world. For me, the key to working with writers is whether you are willing to go deep into each other's heart and get close to me. If you can't fight in the depths of the other's soul, you can't make brilliant creations. In order to do this work, you must follow this rule before you can achieve something. After all, our job is to make people's spiritual activities into commodities, which is a very unpredictable errand.
Take the book ""Brother"" as an example. If I don't have any friendship with Shintaro Ishihara, I would ask him to write this book, and then he would not agree to persuade him. I have always been a loyal reader of Shintaro Ishihara. I have a certain degree of understanding of him. Together with our 20 years of friendship, based on this relationship and background, it is possible to develop the phrase ""I believe in seeing the city. Write and write to see the results. Writers can be treated, redeemed, and liberated through writing, and they are able to impress readers because they convey this message in the book. As for ""this book will be sold well because of this publicity effect"", it is all after the fact.
In fact, every time they interact with writers, their attitudes towards life are questioned, and they will also show their true nature and shortcomings. Therefore, editors must transform their spiritual products through such internal violence. For goods, after all, the spiritual product of human beings is alive.
So, as an editor, we want to make the work go well. There is no other way than to beg the writer with the determination to die. I only teach one thing. ""If you don't want to share important things in your life with writers, then you can't just convince writers, and you can't let them do anything for you."" To be exact, I want them. Use the weight of your own life to interact with the writer.
There is nothing to be said about playing against the writer, you have to understand it yourself. If you are not willing to be jealous of others, the exchanges between the two sides will not have results. The editor does not reveal his inner entanglements, but the writer only can honestly meet you guys. It is a fantasy! I think this is the root of interpersonal relationships. When I plan to win the favor of a writer, I will bet on my life. Read all the other books thoroughly, spend a whole week, turn my request into words, and write about ten letters. I always tell myself, ""It’s strange that the other party can read these letters without agreeing to my request.""
People in the publishing industry said: ""Art-related books are difficult to make money, books are difficult to sell, and the decline in social reading population is the main reason."" They also said that the current publishing industry is sluggish because of the severe economic environment. Now ""Editors must also understand the readers and the market. The real key to success or failure is whether the editors can have the sensitivity of the salesperson."" It has become a common statement in the publishing industry. I want to say, what kind of neuropathy, this is not the case. The book is not selling well, it is entirely the responsibility of the publishing industry. Just because you can't communicate honestly with your life and writers, you can't make a good book that impresses your readers.
Shortly after the establishment of the publishing house, I decided to publish the full version of the advertisement in the newspaper, whether it was to make the book ""Daddy"" an exclusive insider's media, and the first edition printed 500,000 copies, or the fantasy winter house library in one breath. The launch of 62 new books to grab the market is a feat of my slap in the face, and has successfully created millions of bestsellers and classic books. Therefore, books can't be sold, and there is no absolute relationship with the economy. It is the most problematic to blame the slow sales of books on the downturn. In other words, think of this idea as an editor or publisher who is not aware of self-review, and their negative mentality is the problem.
Needless to say, editors must of course have the sensitivity of a salesperson. The key to success or failure usually depends on this obvious fact. In my opinion, publishers and editors can't face the reality and take up their own responsibilities. They also defend themselves for such awkward self. They are really reckless and have no consideration. When they become the kind of question, why not? It will cause the situation in front of us, and it will only endure silently. Even those who have the ill-conceived routine as a standard, it is really too late, because those routines have already been seriously out of touch with reality.
To break through this negative routine, we must be more reckless in order to succeed, so I and the Magic Winter House can only collide with the original conventional system more recklessly. After all, it is only through the way of human beings that they can cure their own people. ""If you are a newcomer to the fledgling, if you dare not collide with each other, what changes can you make?"" This sentence does not simply mean the recklessness of our company in the publishing industry, but encourages everyone to courageously collide. Those irresponsible routine habits. I think that the essence of things is flourishing, and only when we are willing to pursue it with our whole heart, the essence of things will stand out. This principle is not limited to how to sell high books. A society must also operate with such a serious attitude to make progress and innovation. I just hold this belief in the business of publishing.
Selling books is not inconsistent with the use of life and writers. Business and editorial work are not in conflict.
For me, the best-selling book is a good book. Some people will question, isn't that a good book just like that? In fact, the definition of a good book is very broad. Both the author and the editor feel that they have completed the extraordinary work and published the book with great self-esteem. The result is that they can't sell it. The ideal situation is that writing well and selling best, if both are lost, the most embarrassing. Using a similar mentality to compile books can only lead to ""almost"" results. What the editor and author are pursuing is whether the book can be sold well, or is it content that is promising, or both?
Personally, I just want to make works that I and the writers feel are brilliant. For example, in fact, the ""Two People"" manuscript has been completed as early as one year before publication. If the other party wants to publish it, he can print it at any time. However, Tang Zeshou Ming and I are not satisfied. At that time, Tang Ze was a very handsome young man. It would not be a problem to sell about 100,000 copies after the book was listed. Having said that, if you finally let the other party feel that you are ""repenting from the beginning,"" then you will not be able to cooperate again. Even if you finally sell 100,000 copies, but let the other party not want to work with you again, that is the biggest failure of the editor.
Therefore, although our company was just established at that time and was quite short of money, I still sweared to Tang Ze, saying that it is okay to publish the book without rushing, and the publication date of ""Two People"" was postponed. As a result, Tang Ze and Yamaguchi Tomoko were married. This book seized this opportunity and became a best-selling book selling millions of copies. Compared with the million yen that our company may have directly entered into the account, it is 100 million yen after three years. The correctness of the decision is very obvious.
Simply put, don't rush to get results. In my experience, editors must establish close relationships with writers, and then carefully consider their work, look at the timing, and finally have a sales success. Books must be published, of course, they must be sold well, and selling books and using life and writers to accompany, do not conflict with business and editorial work.
