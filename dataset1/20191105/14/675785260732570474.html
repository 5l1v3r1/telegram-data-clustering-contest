      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:35:21+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Standley, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>A nurse whose career was ended by ill health was forced to live in a home seeped with raw sewage as she struggled to adjust to a life on benefits.</p>
      <p>Karen Fowler went from earning £40,000 annually to living off £1,000 a month and was housed in substandard accommodation after her landlord threw her out when she became unemployed.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old suffers from chronic pain caused by conditions affecting her spine, nerves and muscles, and suffers with mental health problems including anxiety and depression.</p>
      <p>Her debilitating illnesses eventually become too much and she resigned from her job, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/nurse-earning-council-flat-sewage-3492751">Hull Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"The last two years have been an absolute nightmare," she said.</p>

      <p>"I came out of a good job into no income, not knowing how to claim benefits"</p>
      <p>She said she had been living in a property paying rent of £600 per month, but contacted the landlord after she left work to say she would soon be unable to pay.</p>
      <p>"I just didn't know how to go from £40,000 per year to less than £1,000 per month," she said.</p>
      <p>But the landlord took legal action and by the time East Riding Council had offered to cover the rent, Miss Fowler had already been formally evicted.</p>
      <p>She was rehoused by the council three days before her eviction in 2018.</p>
      <p>"They said it'd need decorating and offered me a £200 decorating grant," she said.</p>
      <p>"So I thought, 'Well there's people in far worse situations, being homeless and things like that'.</p>
      <p>"I went into the bedroom and it smelt like faeces.</p>
      <p>"But they said I had no other option but to take it.</p>

      <p>Miss Fowler said she spent the next nine months living with candles on and the windows open, regularly complaining to the council about the stench.</p>
      <p>"I had officers from housing come round and say it just needed stripping and decorating," she said.</p>
      <p>"But the smell just wouldn't go and people kept commenting on it."</p>
      <p>She said she was hospitalised four times in that period because of vomiting and constant retching.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't keep my food down, I dropped to 7st 8lb," she said.</p>
      <p>"I once retched for eight hours straight and couldn't keep my meds down.</p>
      <p>"I know that I ingested fecal spores.</p>
      <p>"Then soon as the repairs were done and I moved back in, it stopped."</p>
      <p>It was not until December, nine months after she moved into the property, that the council placed her in alternative accommodation while they carried out the work.</p>
      <p>A damaged pipe connected to the flat above hers was found to have leaked sewage into the walls of her living room, kitchen and bedroom.</p>
      <p>Workers had to remove the plaster from the walls completely. She was moved back in eight days later.</p>
      <p>"It was just all such a rush to throw me back in there," she said.</p>
      <p>"I still had no floor covering, my sofas were all folded together, my belongings were all moved into the garage, I had no bedding. My kitchen was covered in cellophane."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for East Riding Council said: "We carried out a number of repairs to the resident's flat in Watts Road last year, including works to an internal drainage pipe.</p>
      <p>"She was moved out of the property into temporary accommodation of her own choosing at the council's expense, while the work was carried out.</p>
      <p>"All the work was completed before last Christmas and no repairs have been reported to us since."</p>
