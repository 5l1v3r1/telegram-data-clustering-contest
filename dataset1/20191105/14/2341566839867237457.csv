台港司法漏洞再現 台搶匪在港犯案後回國成陳同佳第二

（中央社台北5日電）台港兩地欠缺司法互助的困境再現。一名台籍嫌犯10月在香港搶劫鐘錶行後飛回台灣，在缺乏司法互助機制下，後續的逮捕和追訴再成難題，恐淪為第二個陳同佳案。
香港南華早報報導，一名台籍嫌犯10月6日持空氣槍，搶劫一間位於尖沙咀麼地道的鐘錶行，並得手兩只價值港幣99萬元（約新台幣384萬元）的手錶。
報導引述香港警方指出，嫌犯於當天上午抵達香港，犯案後隨即在當晚飛回台灣。
報導稱，香港政府正努力與台灣確認嫌犯身分，但由於台港兩地目前沒有司法互助機制，陷入困境。
報導引述港府消息人士表示，除非嫌犯回到香港，否則無法起訴他。但在現行制度下，這名嫌犯在台灣是自由人，港府無法要求台灣政府將他逮捕並送回香港受審；而港府也不會把監視器畫面等證據移交給台灣。
這起搶案發生在港女命案兇嫌陳同佳於香港獲釋前夕，港府人士指，嫌犯可能因此案意識到台港之間的司法漏洞，因而選擇到香港犯案。（編輯：沈朋達/朱建陵）1081105

Taiwan and Hong Kong judicial loopholes reappeared after the murder of the case in Hong Kong, returning to Guocheng Chen Tongjia second
05 Nov 2019, 14:44 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th) The dilemma of lack of mutual legal assistance between Taiwan and Hong Kong has reappeared. A Taiwanese suspect flew back to Taiwan after looting clocks and clocks in Hong Kong in October. In the absence of a mutual legal assistance mechanism, subsequent arrests and prosecutions became a problem, fearing to be the second Chen Tongjia case.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that a Taiwanese suspect held an air gun on October 6 to rob a watch line in Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, and won two watches worth HK$9.9 million (about NT$3.84 million).
The newspaper quoted the Hong Kong police as saying that the suspect arrived in Hong Kong that morning and flew back to Taiwan on the night after committing the crime.
The report said that the Hong Kong government is trying to confirm the status of suspects with Taiwan, but because Taiwan and Hong Kong currently do not have a mutual legal assistance mechanism, they are in trouble.
The newspaper quoted a source from the Hong Kong government as saying that unless the suspect returns to Hong Kong, he cannot be prosecuted. However, under the current system, the suspect is a free man in Taiwan. The Hong Kong Government cannot ask the Taiwanese government to arrest him and return it to Hong Kong for trial. The Hong Kong Government will not hand over evidence such as monitor images to Taiwan.
The robbery occurred in the case of Hong Kong's female murder case, Chen Tongjia, on the eve of the release of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government said that the suspect may be aware of the judicial loophole between Taiwan and Hong Kong and chose to commit crimes in Hong Kong.
