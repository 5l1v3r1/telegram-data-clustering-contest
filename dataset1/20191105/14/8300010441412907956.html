      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Krispy Kreme has reached an agreement with a Minnesota college student who drove to Iowa every weekend to buy hundreds of doughnuts to resell them in the Twin Cities area.<br/><br/>The company said in a statement Monday that Jayson Gonzalez of Champlin can now work with Krispy Kreme as an independent operator. The deal also includes a 500-dozen doughnut donation when he starts up again.<br/><br/>The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the 21-year-old Gonzalez also announced the deal on his Facebook page, adding that he's "pumped" to continue his business.<br/><br/>Last week, <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/society/krispy-kreme-orders-student-to-halt-doughnut-resale-service/5668842/">Krispy Kreme told Gonzalez</a> to stop the resell venture because it created a liability for the company.<br/><br/>The confectionary giant said in its statement Monday that the "temporary stoppage" was to ensure product quality and regulatory compliance<br/><br/>Gonzalez would drive 270 miles (430 kilometers) to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa, pack his car with up to 100 boxes, each carrying 12 doughnuts, then drive back up north to deliver them to customers in Minneapolis-St. Paul.<br/><br/>He charged $17 to $20 per box. He said some of his customers spent nearly $100 each time. Gonzalez said he did not receive a discount from the store in Iowa where he bought the doughnuts.</p>
