Video: Persona 5 Scramble Gets A New Trailer Introducing Joker
Just months ahead of its launch
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Ryan Craddock



Atlus has shared a brand new trailer for the upcoming Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers, which is set to launch on Nintendo Switch in Japan in February.
As you can see for yourself, the video focuses on the protagonist, Joker, a character who Nintendo fans now know inside and out thanks to his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Persona 5 Scramble was first revealed for Switch back in April this year and is an action-RPG spin-off from the main series created in partnership with Koei Tecmo and Omega Force.
This Joker-specific video arrives shortly after a lengthy presentation on the game, which was shared on YouTube by Atlus yesterday. If you're interested, you can catch decent chunks of gameplay through the presentation, although you likely won't be able to understand what's happening fully without a good grasp on the Japanese language.
