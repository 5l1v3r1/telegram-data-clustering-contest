保障全國外送員 勞動部：由中央齊一規範

（中央社記者陳俊華台北5日電）美食外送員車禍事故不斷，勞動權益引起外界關注。勞動部次長林明裕今天說，有4萬5129名外送員遍布全國，勞動部已律定由中央做齊一規範，要讓全國外送員都能受到保障。
民進黨立委林靜儀、鍾孔炤上午在立法院舉行「網路訂餐平台外送員勞動權益保障」公聽會。林靜儀指出，有5家外送平台被認定與外送員屬僱傭關係，可預期平台業者為減省保險等成本，可能按勞檢認定為僱傭關係的依據，將外送員調整為「真承攬」，讓勞工自行承擔風險。
林明裕說，台北市政府已訂定「台北市外送平台業者管理自治條例」草案，與中央相輔相成，勞動部在10月中下旬也律定，要由中央做齊一的規範，基於共有4萬5129名外送員遍布全國，中央責任就是要讓全國外送員都能受到保障。
桃園市外送平台從業人員職業工會顧問吳昭儒說，外送員加入職業工會後，須負擔一定的勞健保費用，正職外送員願負擔，但兼職外送員希望透過工會協助加保團體意外險，也盼未來工會透過集體協商方式，跟平台有談勞動條件的空間。
文化大學勞動暨人力資源學系教授李健鴻說，政府鼓勵外送員加入職業工會，但某些工會的成立宗旨、成立本業跟外送員明顯不符，如百貨零售工會、大貨車駕駛職業工會等都在招攬會員，萬一外送員發生事故要去勞保局申請給付，是否符合勞保局的本業範圍，恐有疑慮。
台北科技大學智慧財產權研究所副教授江雅綺表示，在數位經濟下，勞動型態有很多不同變形，應名實相符，應有最低勞動安全保障網存在。例如德國，勞工若有超過5成收入來自同一家企業，企業就要負擔部分雇主責任；法國國民議會二讀通過「移動趨勢法案」草案，保障外送員薪酬、工時、契約等。（編輯：郭萍英）1081105

Guarantee the national delivery staff Ministry of Labor: standardized by the central government
05 Nov 2019, 14:34 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Chen Junhua, Taipei, 5th) Food accidents have caused accidents in car accidents, and labor rights have attracted attention from outside. Lin Mingyu, the deputy head of the Ministry of Labor, said today that there are 45,129 dispatchers all over the country. The Ministry of Labor has ruled that the central government should make uniforms to ensure that the national delivery staff can be protected.
The Democratic Progressive Party legislators, Lin Jingyi and Zhong Kongyu, held a public hearing on the ""Network Ordering Platform Delivery Workers' Rights and Interests Protection"" in the Legislative Yuan in the morning. Lin Jingyi pointed out that there are five delivery platforms that are identified as having an employment relationship with the delivery staff. It is expected that the platform operators will reduce the cost of insurance and other insurance, and may determine the basis of the employment relationship according to the labor inspection, and adjust the delivery staff to Let the workers take risks themselves.
Lin Mingyu said that the Taipei Municipal Government has formulated a draft of the ""Regulations on the Management of Taiwanese Delivery Platform Operators"", which complements the central government. The Ministry of Labor also stipulates in the middle and late October that it is necessary to be standardized by the central government. With 5,129 dispatchers all over the country, the central responsibility is to ensure that the national delivery staff can be protected.
Wu Zhaoru, a consultant of the professional trade union of the Taoyuan City delivery platform, said that after joining the professional trade union, the delivery staff must bear certain labor and health insurance costs. The full-time delivery staff is willing to pay, but the part-time delivery staff hopes to help the group insurance accident through the trade union. I also hope that the future trade unions will have room for working conditions with the platform through collective bargaining.
Li Jianhong, a professor at the Department of Labor and Human Resources at the University of Culture, said that the government encourages the delivery of workers to join the professional trade unions. However, the establishment of certain trade unions and the establishment of the industry are obviously inconsistent with the delivery of goods, such as department store retail unions, large truck driving professional unions, etc. In the case of recruiting members, if the dispatcher has to go to the Labor Insurance Bureau to apply for payment in case of an accident, it is doubtful whether it meets the scope of the Labor Insurance Bureau.
Jiang Yaxuan, an associate professor at the Institute of Intellectual Property Rights at the Taipei University of Science and Technology, said that in the digital economy, there are many different variants of the labor pattern, which should be consistent with the name, and there should be a minimum labor safety net. For example, in Germany, if more than 50% of the workers are from the same company, the company will bear some of the employer's responsibilities; the French National Assembly will adopt the draft of the “Mobile Trends Act” to ensure the pay, hours and contracts of the delivery staff.
