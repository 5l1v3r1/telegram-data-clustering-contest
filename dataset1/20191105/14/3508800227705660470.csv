《台灣史論叢：客家篇》：台灣族群概念的現代性與「客家認同」的特殊性
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是現代族群概念下的「泛台灣客家認同」，和先前台灣社會中就已存在的傳統客家認同，在社會性質、運作的範疇與功能上到底有沒有重要的差異？



文：王甫昌（美國亞利桑納大學社會學博士，目前為中央研究院社會學研究所研究員）
【由文化、地域到族群：再論當代台灣客家族群意識的現代性】
一、前言：台灣族群概念的現代性與客家認同的特殊性
1980年代中期以後台灣社會巨大政治與社會變遷中，民主化政治轉型與族群問題的公共化，相當受到矚目。在此轉變過程中，過去被視為禁忌話題的「省籍問題」，因為代表「外省籍第二代」政治行動者指出外省人是政治及經濟上的弱勢者，引起民進黨籍立委在立法院質詢中反駁，而使得省籍問題在1987年之後成為媒體報導、學術研究及政治辯論的焦點（王甫昌 2008）。這也引發了到底誰是「弱勢群體」的討論，進而導致原先「省籍」分歧之外，「原住民／漢人」及「閩南／客家」區分與群體關係，也成為當代台灣族群問題的重要面向與課題。
在這樣的背景下，1990年代初期浮現的「台灣四大族群」政治論述，相較於過去「本省／外省」的省籍二分法，是具有深刻現代性意涵的新型態人群分類與群體關係想像。「台灣四大族群論述」的現代性意涵，可以由下列三個面向見其一端。
首先，將「台灣四大族群」的區分置於同一層次的群體分類上，是相當晚近的現象，在1980年代末期到1990年代初期才浮現。雖然「本省福佬（閩南）人、本省客家人、原住民、外省人」的台灣人群分類早在戰後初期就已經出現，例如，陳紹馨與傅瑞德早在1970年就已經根據1956年的戶口普查結果，四分之一的戶口抽樣，試圖去分析台灣人口的姓氏分布的研究中，繪製了「人口按祖籍之分佈圖」（陳紹馨、傅瑞德 1970: 5）。他們指出：「此類地圖係企圖藉符合廣泛自己認同的民族之一般特徵而繪製的人口分佈圖。共分四大類：福建、客家、外省人及山胞等」。
在該書更詳細的定義中，本省籍漢人因為祖籍福建、或廣東，以及使用語言的差異，分為「閩南人」及「客家人」；原居台灣的土著，並非漢籍；至於二次大戰後來台的中國大陸各省居民，則被稱為「外省人」（陳紹馨、傅瑞德 1970: 18）。這是根據「符合廣泛自己認同」的群體區分；但是，他們並非官方眼中最重要的區分。在該次戶口普查中，最主要的官方統計類屬區分是台灣省與大陸各省的「省籍」區分（王甫昌 2005）。事實上，戰後官方統計類屬中足以區分出台灣省籍「福佬（閩南）人」及「客家人」的「祖籍」類屬，也僅出現在1956及1966年兩次每10年一度的戶口普查中，其他每年出版的例行官方統計並沒有這項類屬；而1970年的戶口普查抽樣調查，以及1980年之後的正式戶口普查也不都再統計台灣省籍者的「祖籍」（王甫昌 2005）。
這些官方統計類屬的慣行，顯示了政府認為重要的「籍別」分類和一般民間習以為常的分類之落差。然而，更重要的是台灣省籍者的「閩客」分類意識，過去一直有很大地區間差異（見本章下面的討論）。由於客家人不僅人數較少而且相對集中在特定地區，除了鄰近福佬人地區者之外，大多數沒有機會經常接觸福佬人；同樣的，人數上居於絕對多數的「福佬（閩南）人」大多數也沒有機會接觸客家人，他們都不容易有「閩客區分」的分類意識。因此，台灣四大族群普遍成為一般人認為有意義的人群分類，以及政治論述的重要元素，是相當晚近的發展。
其次是族群類屬與族群界定標準的變化。與過去強調「省籍」區分為主的官方分類相比較，「台灣四大族群」最大的變化是類屬的合併與細分。過去官方統計一向詳細統計與區分的「大陸各省」人，現在被合併為「外省人」；而被歸類為「台灣省籍」者，則進一步細分為福佬（閩南）人、客家人及原住民。這些族群類屬變化背後，其實反映了族群界定標準的重要變化。
在現代社會族群互動多元而頻繁的狀況下，族群這個通常以群體文化特徵或共同祖源為成員身分主要界定標準的人群分類概念，還有一項通常未得到同等注意的重要特徵：處於相似不利社會地位的群體（不論是否有相同的文化），也可能以他們共同相對於其所界定的優勢（文化）群體之社會位置，而自我界定為「弱勢族群」。事實上，許多學者都指出當代的族群性，不僅是「文化位置」，更是一種「社會位置」的策略性自我宣稱（Bennett 1975）。這兩項特徵的交織，使得當代人們對於「族群」的人群觀念，往往和過去僅僅由「文化特徵」作為界定成員身分的主要標準的人群分類概念，有明顯的差異。
一項重要的差異是，成員之間對於「社會關係」或「社會位置」的不對稱或不均衡的共同認知，有時反而成為當代人們界定「族群類屬」時更重要的標準。在這種狀況下，共同祖源或文化特性雖然通常仍是界定族群不可或缺的重要標準之一，但是用於界定族群內部成員之間的文化共同性，或是族群之間文化差異的認定標準卻可能十分寬鬆、甚至武斷；而且族群類屬之間對比性文化差異的重要性，往往超過族群類屬內族群成員的文化相似性或同質性。
第三，與上一點有關的，現代族群概念除了涉及如何分類不同族群外，也隱含一種新型態的理想族群關係，亦即：處於相對弱勢位置的群體，要求與同一社會系統中其他群體，不因文化差異而受到不平等待遇的理想性社會關係主張（Royce 1982）。尤其是在民主化的社會中，在普遍性平等公民權概念下，破除制度性或社會性不對等的群體關係，通常是處於社會或政治弱勢位置群體的主張。
1992年以後在台灣開始流行的「台灣四大族群」政治論述中，對於台灣某些主要族群的界定，以及理想群體關係的要求，似乎相當符合上述說法。尤其是在如何區分及界定族群上更是如此。由於台灣原住民各族之間並無共同的傳統語言與文化，台灣的「原住民（族）」作為一個「族群」類屬，主要並非基於成員之間的「文化共同性」，而是建立在對比於「漢人」（或「漢人社會」，包括「外省人」、「福佬人」及「客家人」）的共同社會處境（孫大川 2000）。1980年代初期原住民菁英族群運動論述所建構出來的兩個族群類屬（「原住民」相對於「漢人」），雖然內部都各有重要的群體文化差異，但是，泛「原住民」族群意識或運動論述強調的是「原漢」兩個類屬之間的差異；他們主要是透過原住民「共同的社會處境」的描繪，作為其弱勢族群論述的核心。
同樣的，台灣「外省人」之共同族群身分，也不是基於大陸各省來台人士之間的共同文化特質，而是對比於「台灣省籍」的集體文化差異與共同（不利）處境而浮現。雖然戰後以來，因為接觸初期的衝突經驗、語言文化差異，及社會生活的隔離，使得台灣省籍者經常將大陸各省份人士，不區分其內部差異，而一體視為「外省人」，但是，大陸各省人士在原有「省份」認同的意識下，通常並不接受、也不認同「外省人」的共同身分。然而，1970年代以後，國民黨高層為安撫台籍政治菁英而大力提拔本省籍青年進入高層政治職位，以及開放中央民代表補選中多數當選者皆為台籍，使得「外省籍」青年開始覺得自己在台灣沒有政治前途。這種共同的危機意識，導致「外省籍第二代」政治菁英在1980年代中期以後，公開宣揚與建構超越大陸省份，以及相對於台灣省籍的「外省籍」身分（王甫昌 2016）。
台灣客家人的族群意識建構，也正是1980年代公開討論「省籍問題」的背景中，客家文化菁英有感於客家人的語言權利、社會地位、文化特性在當時主流的「本省／外省」及「山地／平地」兩元區分中被模糊化，而試圖進行「自我定位」的政治反省（蕭新煌 1988）。蕭新煌就認為當時標舉「客家意識」的目的在於：
在台灣社會族群構成圖像裡，更明顯的標示出「客家人」此一社會與語言的類屬，以打破長久以來本省、外省的二分法，或是平地人、山地人的兩元論。⋯⋯客家人類屬的獨特性大概就是在這種兩極劃分之下，被人工化的分類到「本省」和「平地」之中。但是「本省」和「平地」，這兩個粗分類屬，卻又分別代表著極不相同的社會、文化和政治意含，一是弱勢，一是強勢。在「本省」與「外省」的政治社會認同矛盾之下，閩客之間的差異，也就被刻意的淡化和模糊；在「平地」與「山地」的文化經濟極不均衡的支配權力關係之下，客家、閩南與內地的分野，也更顯得不具實質的意義和重要性。因此，長期以來，客家人便只有老是「被分類」的分，而不能有明顯的自我定位。（蕭新煌 1988）
而徐正光更是明白指出當時台灣客家人與客家社會所面臨的重大問題，以及未來的任務與使命：
第一，客家話大量流失及文化將滅絕的困境。⋯⋯第二，重新建立歷史的詮釋權，讓被扭曲的客家人的形象，還其歷史的面貌。⋯⋯第三，建立民主公平的政經體制，爭取客家人的合理權益。⋯⋯第四，重建合理的族群關係，以作為新的社會秩序的基礎。（徐正光 1991: 8-9）
這些客家文化運動工作者提出了一個以全台灣各地客家人整體的文化、社會與政治經濟權益為標的之主張，並期望建立合理的族群關係。台灣客家人共同身分的界定，雖然有其相同語言與文化的基礎，但是過去國家獨尊國語的語言政策，以及民進黨成立後，為了反對國民黨而在抗爭策略上顯露的福佬沙文主義，讓客家人感受到處於共同的不利社會位置，更是凝聚各地客家人的重要短期因素。
至於台灣的「福佬（閩南）人」成為一個「族群」類屬，主要也不是因為成員的共同語言文化（過去清代及日治時期有「漳泉」的區分，目前內部也仍有相當大的地域性差別），而是在1990年代以後，為了回應其他群體，特別是客家人集體而公開化抗議，而不得不採行、自我限縮性的社會身分或人群範疇。
上述台灣族群概念或不同族群意識發展的經驗顯示，經由不同時期浮現的族群相關運動的建構，四個主要的族群類屬都發展出其特有的弱勢族群論述。這也為台灣民主化轉型過程中，重建理想的政治與社會關係之政治現代化工程，帶入了追求族群平等與公義的主張。台灣四大族群之間應維持差異但平等的理想族群關係，也成為1980年代末到1990年代初期，許多政治行動者提出的理想政治藍圖中重要的部分。
有關「台灣四大族群」論述內容與建構過程，也成為1990年代中期到2000年代初期，許多台灣社會科學研究者，包括筆者在內，進行「族群研究」的主要課題之一。當時有不少研究者認為1980年代中期以後，在台灣逐漸普遍化的「族群」概念，雖然所具體界定的台灣族群群體，都有其歷史或文化特殊性淵源，但是這些新的人群分類概念似乎是為了因應當代新的社會情勢與政治制度的變革，而被建構出來的新型態群體認同。具體的說，1980年代正是台灣社會民主化與本土化政治轉型啟動的關鍵時期，在「國會全面改選」訴求甚囂塵上之際，族群（平等）成為建構新的、合理的政治權力結構必須考慮的重要向度。而台灣族群的分類與界定，特別是「原住民」與「外省人」作為「族群」，似乎也反映了這種政治考量，而以強調「共同的弱勢位置」，而不光指是「共同的語言或文化」作為族群的界定標準。
這些關於台灣現代族群概念新內涵的說法，也被延伸到福佬人，或是客家人的族群分類意識上。作者在2000年代初期，現代台灣客家學術研究方興未艾之際，曾經提出在當代族群概念影響，以及客家文化運動建構下，台灣客家的族群認同在社會意義與性質的內涵上，出現了迥異於傳統的客家身分意識的斷裂性轉變之說法：
1980年代客家文化運動出現以後，所產生的客家認同與想像，和過去的「客家認同」，在社會意義及實際對比的類屬上，有極大的差異。作者將前者稱為「泛台灣客家認同」。雖然當代泛台灣客家認同，在實質文化與歷史內容上，和過去的「客家認同」有相當程度的相似性及延續性，但是，他們的社會意義與性質已有重大的轉變，不應該將二者混為一談。（王甫昌 2003: 121）
而作者認為主要的差異在於：1980年代後出現的「泛台灣客家認同」，是超越地域性（主要是南、北的客家地區）及次方言（主要是客語的四縣與海陸腔調）的區隔，而形成以整個台灣為範圍的台灣客家人認同（王甫昌 2003: 124），而1988年底象徵著「客家文化運動」崛起的「還我母語大遊行」，則是作者認為建構此種新認同的起點。
這個客家運動建構現代客家認同的說法，隨著行政院客家委員會、客家研究機構及客家學院陸續成立，大量客家相關研究出現後，引發不少討論與回應。許多2005年以後的客家研究都指出，以整個台灣的客家人為範疇「客家」身分意識，並不是到1980年代末期客家運動建構才出現；早在清代就已經有類似的「客人」，或「粵東」、「粵人」身分意識。
這些「以全島為範圍的客家人觀念歷史上早已存在」的新發現，乍看下似乎對於先前研究宣稱「泛台灣客家認同」是1980年代客家運動所建構的說法形成一些挑戰。其中最明顯而重要的挑戰在於「客家人」相對於台灣其他「族群類屬」在族群歷史淵源上的特殊性：「外省人」、「原住民」或「福佬人」的族群類屬或人群範疇，似乎都是當代行動者透過「共同社會位置」的運動論述建構與界定才出現的新人群類屬或範疇；唯有「客家人」這個整體性人群類屬，似乎有長遠的歷史淵源，而且有明顯可見的特殊語言或文化作為群體界定的基礎。
不過「以台灣為整體的客家身分認同」在不同時期的社會脈絡下，可能各有其不同性質與社會意義或功能。因此，這些新研究發現讓研究者有機會重新去討論下面這個重要的研究課題：現代族群概念下的「泛台灣客家認同」，和先前台灣社會中就已存在的傳統客家認同，在社會性質、運作的範疇與功能上到底有沒有重要的差異？
本章主要目的，在於根據過去10年來新的研究成果，以及客家研究大量浮現後，開始被研究者注意到或是新出土的各種文獻與史料，特別是1987年客家文化運動出現前的20年內，台灣不同地區的客家相關文獻，重新檢視運動出現前後，客家認同內容及性質的轉變，是否構成人群分類概念重要斷裂的問題。除了審視關於清代「客家形成」的新研究成果外，本章也將特別引述與討論有關清末及日治時期台灣社會基本型態或社會組織原則變化的研究，以及論證戰後以來傳統客家社會中的客家群體概念，在面臨現代化轉變新情勢下出現客家人被「族群化」的群體概念之轉變。
本章將分析代表大陸來台的外省客家人1960年代在苗栗地區所發行的《苗友》與《中原》雜誌，1980年代中期在苗栗地區由當地客家人所創辦的《三台》雜誌，以及1970年代初期在南部高屏的六堆地區所出版的《六堆客家鄉土誌》以及《六堆》集刊，以便和1987年以後出版的《客家風雲》與《客家雜誌》進行內容分析與比較，以探討「客家群體」概念內涵在客家「族群化」前後的變化。

""On Taiwan History: Hakka"": The Modernity of the Concept of Taiwan Ethnic Group and the Particularity of ""Hakka Identity""
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is the ""pan-Taiwan Hakka identity"" under the concept of modern ethnic group, and the traditional Hakka identity that existed in Taiwanese society before, is there any important difference in the nature and function of the social nature?



Text: Wang Yichang (Ph.D. in Sociology, University of Arizona, USA, currently a researcher at the Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica)
[From Culture, Region to Ethnic Group: Re-discussion on the Modernity of Contemporary Taiwanese Family Group Consciousness]
I. Foreword: The Modernity of the Concept of Taiwan Ethnic Group and the Particularity of Hakka Identity
In the great political and social changes in Taiwan's society since the mid-1980s, the political transformation of democratization and the publicization of ethnic issues have attracted considerable attention. In the process of this transformation, the ""provincial issue"" that was regarded as a taboo topic in the past, because the political activists representing the ""second generation of foreign provinces"" pointed out that the foreigners are politically and economically disadvantaged, causing the DPP legislators to The Legislative Yuan questioned the rebuttal, which made the provincial issue a focus of media coverage, academic research and political debate after 1987 (Wang Yichang 2008). This has also led to the discussion of who is a ""vulnerable group"", which in turn leads to the differences between the ""indigenous people / Han people"" and ""Minnan / Hakka"" and the group relationship, which has become an important issue in contemporary Taiwanese ethnic groups. Facing and problem.
In this context, the political discourse of the ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" that emerged in the early 1990s is a new type of population classification and group with profound modern meaning compared with the provincial dichotomy of the ""provincial/external provinces"" in the past. Relationship imagination. The modern meaning of ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" can be seen from one of the following three aspects.
First of all, it is quite late to put the distinction of ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" on the same level of group classification, which only emerged from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Although the classification of Taiwanese people in the province's Welfare (Southern Fujian), the province's Hakkas, aborigines, and other provinces has already appeared in the early postwar period. For example, Chen Shaoxin and Fu Ruide have already been based on the 1956 account as early as 1970. The results of the census, a quarter of the household sample, attempted to analyze the distribution of the surnames of the Taiwanese population, and plotted the distribution map of the population according to the ancestral home (Chen Shaoxin, Fu Ruide 1970: 5). They pointed out: ""This type of map is a population distribution map drawn by the general characteristics of a nation that is widely recognized by itself. It is divided into four categories: Fujian, Hakka, other provinces and mountain cells.""
In the more detailed definition of the book, the Han Chinese in this province are divided into ""Southern Fujian"" and ""Hakka"" because of their differences in ancestral homes in Fujian, Guangdong, and language; the indigenous people who lived in Taiwan are not Chinese; as for the Second World War Later, the residents of various provinces in mainland China were called ""outside provinces"" (Chen Shaoxin, Fu Ruide 1970: 18). This is based on a group that is ""in line with broad self-identification""; however, they are not the most important distinction in the official eye. In the census of the household registration, the most important official statistical category is the “provincial” distinction between Taiwan Province and the mainland provinces (Wang Yichang 2005). In fact, the post-war official statistics category is a genus of ""grandfathers"" that is sufficient to distinguish Taiwanese ""Fujian (Southern) people"" and ""Hakka"". It only appeared once every 10 years in 1956 and 1966. In the household census, other routine statistics published annually do not have this category; and the 1970 census sample survey and the official household census after 1980 do not count the ""ancestorship"" of Taiwanese nationals. (Wang Yuchang 2005).
The habits of these official statistical categories show the difference between the “country” classification that the government considers important and the classification that the general folks take for granted. However, what is more important is the “customer” classification consciousness of Taiwanese nationals. There have been many regional differences in the past (see discussion below in this chapter). Since the Hakkas are not only small in number but also relatively concentrated in specific areas, most of them do not have the opportunity to contact the welfare people in addition to the neighboring welfare areas. Similarly, the number of people in the absolute majority is ""Funan"". Most of them do not have the opportunity to contact Hakkas. They are not easy to have a classification awareness of ""hacker differentiation."" Therefore, the four major ethnic groups in Taiwan have generally become the classification of people that the average person considers meaningful, as well as an important element of political discourse, which is quite late development.
The second is the change in the classification criteria of ethnic groups and ethnic groups. Compared with the official classification that emphasized the distinction between ""provincial status"" in the past, the biggest change in ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" is the merger and subdivision of generics. In the past, the official statistics of the ""country of the mainland"" who have been detailed statistics and distinctions have now been merged into ""outside provinces""; those classified as ""Taiwanese provinces"" are further subdivided into Fushun (Southern Fujian), Hakka and Aboriginal people. Behind these ethnic group changes, it actually reflects important changes in the criteria for defining ethnic groups.
In the context of the diverse and frequent interaction of ethnic groups in modern society, ethnic groups, which usually define group standards based on group culture characteristics or common ancestral values, also have an important feature that is usually not equally noticed: in a similarly disadvantaged society. Status groups (whether or not they have the same culture) may also define themselves as “vulnerable groups” by their collective position relative to the social position of their defined (cultural) groups. In fact, many scholars have pointed out that contemporary ethnicity is not only a ""cultural position"" but also a strategic self-declaration of ""social position"" (Bennett 1975). The interweaving of these two characteristics makes contemporary people's conception of ""ethnic group"" often different from the concept of group classification in the past only by ""cultural characteristics"" as the main criterion for defining member status.
An important difference is that the common understanding of the asymmetry or imbalance between members of ""social relations"" or ""social position"" has sometimes become a more important criterion for contemporary people to define ""ethnic groups."" In this situation, the common ancestral or cultural identity is still one of the important criteria for defining the ethnic group, but it is used to define the cultural commonality among the members of the ethnic group, or the identification of cultural differences between ethnic groups. Standards may be very loose and even arbitrary; and the importance of comparative cultural differences between ethnic groups often exceeds the cultural similarity or homogeneity of members of ethnic groups.
Third, related to the previous point, the concept of modern ethnic group, in addition to how to classify different ethnic groups, also implies a new type of ideal ethnic group relationship, that is, a group in a relatively weak position, requiring other groups in the same social system. An ideal social relationship that is not treated unfairly because of cultural differences (Royce 1982). Especially in a democratized society, under the concept of universal equality of citizenship, the elimination of institutional or social unequal group relations is usually a claim of social or politically disadvantaged groups.
In the political discourse of the ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" that began to spread in Taiwan after 1992, the definition of certain major ethnic groups in Taiwan and the requirements of ideal group relations seem to be quite consistent with the above statement. This is especially true in how to distinguish and define ethnic groups. Since there is no common traditional language and culture among the aborigines of Taiwan, the ""indigenous peoples"" of Taiwan as a ""ethnic group"" are mainly based on the ""cultural commonality"" between members. In contrast to the common social situation of ""Han Chinese"" (or ""Chinese people"", including ""external people"", ""Fuji people"" and ""Hakka people"" (Sun Dachuan 2000). In the early 1980s, the two ethnic groups (""indigenous people"" versus ""Han"") were constructed by the Aboriginal Ethical Movement. Although there were important group cultural differences in the interior, the Pan-indigenous group The consciousness or movement argument emphasizes the difference between the two primitives of ""the original Han""; they are mainly through the depiction of the ""common social situation"" of the aborigines as the core of their dissidents.
Similarly, the common ethnic identity of Taiwan's ""outside provinces"" is not based on the common cultural traits of Taiwanese people from all walks of life in the mainland, but rather on the collective cultural differences and common (unfavorable) situations of ""Taiwan Province"". Although since the post-war period, because of the conflicting experience, language and cultural differences, and the isolation of social life, the Taiwanese provincials often regard the people of the mainland provinces as different from the internal differences, and the whole is regarded as a ""outside province"". Under the awareness of the original ""province"", people from all provinces in the Mainland generally do not accept or agree with the common identity of ""outside provinces."" However, after the 1970s, the top leaders of the Kuomintang vigorously promoted the political elites of Taiwan to promote the provincial youth to enter high-level political positions, and the majority of the elected members of the Central People’s Democratic Incumbent were all Taiwanese, making “outside provincial youth” begin to feel themselves. There is no political future in Taiwan. This common sense of crisis led to the “second-generation provincial-level” political elites publicly promoting and constructing “external provincial” status beyond the mainland provinces and relative to Taiwanese provinces after the mid-1980s (Wang Yichang 2016).
The construction of the ethnic consciousness of the Hakka people in Taiwan was also the background of the ""provincial issue"" in the 1980s. Hakka culture elites felt that the Hakka people's language rights, social status, and cultural characteristics were mainstream in the province. And the ""mountain/level"" distinction between the two divisions is blurred, and attempts to carry out ""self-positioning"" political reflection (Xiao Xinhuang 1988). Xiao Xinhuang believed that the purpose of marking ""Hakka consciousness"" at that time was:
In the image of Taiwan's social ethnic group, the ""Hakka"" community and language are more clearly marked to break the long-standing dichotomy of the province and other provinces, or the dualism of the flat people and the mountain people. The uniqueness of the Hakka human genus is probably classified into ""the province"" and ""flat land"" by artificial division under this bipolar division. However, the ""provincial"" and ""flat"", these two broad classifications, but they represent very different social, cultural and political implications, one is weak and the other is strong. Under the contradiction between the political and social identity of ""the province"" and ""outside the province"", the differences between the hackers are deliberately diluted and vague; the power relations between the ""flat"" and ""mountain"" cultural economies are extremely uneven. Underneath, the distinction between Hakka, Minnan and the mainland is even more inconspicuous and important. Therefore, for a long time, Hakka people have only been classified as ""classified"" and cannot have obvious self-positioning. (Xiao Xinhuang 1988)
Xu Zhengguang also clearly pointed out the major problems faced by the Hakkas and Hakka society in Taiwan at that time, as well as the tasks and missions of the future:
First, the loss of Hakka dialect and the predicament of cultural extinction. Second, re-establish the right of interpretation of history, let the image of the distorted Hakka, and its historical appearance. Third, establish a democratic and fair political and economic system and strive for the legitimate rights and interests of Hakka people. Fourth, rebuild a reasonable ethnic relationship as the basis of a new social order. (Xu Zhengguang 1991: 8-9)
These Hakka cultural movement workers put forward a proposition of the overall cultural, social and political economic rights of Hakkas throughout Taiwan, and hope to establish a reasonable ethnic relationship. The definition of the common identity of the Hakka people in Taiwan, although it has the same language and cultural foundation, but the language policy of the country in the past, and the welfare chauvinism that was revealed in the resistance strategy in order to oppose the Kuomintang after the establishment of the DPP, Let the Hakka people feel that they are in a common unfavorable social position, and it is an important short-term factor that unites Hakka people everywhere.
As for Taiwan's ""Fushun (Southern) people"", it has become a ""ethnic group"", mainly because of the common language and culture of its members (in the past, there was a ""spring"" in the Qing Dynasty and the Japanese occupation period. Large regional differences), but after the 1990s, in order to respond to other groups, especially the Hakkas collectively and openly protest, they have to adopt, self-restricted social identity or group of people.
The above-mentioned concept of Taiwan ethnic group or the development of different ethnic consciousness shows that the four major ethnic groups have developed their own unique discourses. This is also the political modernization project for rebuilding the ideal political and social relations during the process of Taiwan's democratization, and has brought the idea of pursuing ethnic equality and justice. The ideal ethnic group relationship between the four ethnic groups in Taiwan that should maintain differences but equality has also become an important part of the ideal political blueprint put forward by many political actors from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.
The discussion and construction process of ""Taiwan's four major ethnic groups"" also became one of the major topics of ""ethnic research"" conducted by many Taiwanese social science researchers, including the author, from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. At that time, many researchers believed that the concept of ""ethnicity"" gradually became popular in Taiwan after the mid-1980s. Although the specifically defined Taiwan ethnic groups have their historical or cultural specificities, these new population classification concepts seem to It is to identify the new type of community that has been constructed because of the changes in the social situation and political system. Specifically, the 1980s was a crucial period for the initiation of Taiwan's social democratization and localized political transformation. When the ""recommended general elections in Congress"" was on the verge of chaos, ethnic groups (equality) must be considered in constructing a new and rational political power structure. Important dimension. The classification and definition of the Taiwanese ethnic group, especially the ""indigenous people"" and ""outside provinces"" as ""ethnic groups"" seems to reflect this political consideration, and emphasize the ""common weak position"" rather than the ""common"" Language or culture as a defining standard for ethnic groups.
These claims about the new connotation of the concept of Taiwan's modern ethnic group have also been extended to the well-being of the well-being or the Hakkas. In the early 2000s, when the modern Taiwan Hakka academic research was in the ascendant, it was proposed that under the influence of the concept of contemporary ethnic group and the construction of Hakka cultural movement, the ethnic identity of Taiwan Hakka appeared in the meaning of social significance and nature. The statement of the fracture transformation of Hakka identity consciousness:
After the emergence of the Hakka culture movement in the 1980s, the Hakka identity and imagination generated, and the past ""Hakka identity"", were greatly different in the social and practical comparisons. The author refers to the former as ""Pan Taiwan Hakka Identity."" Although the contemporary Pan-Taiwan Hakkas agree that there is a considerable degree of similarity and continuity between the substantive culture and historical content and the past ""Hakka identity"", their social significance and nature have undergone major changes, and should not be The person is confused. (王甫昌 2003: 121)
The author believes that the main difference is that the ""Pan-Taiwan Hakka Identity"" that emerged after the 1980s is beyond the regional (mainly the Hakka region of the South and the North) and the sub-dialects (mainly the four counties of the Hakka language and the sea and land tone). Separated, and formed by the Taiwanese Hakkas as a whole Taiwanese (Wang Yichang 2003: 124), and at the end of 1988, the ""My Motherland Parade"", which symbolizes the rise of the Hakka Cultural Movement, is believed by the author to construct this new The starting point of identity.
This Hakka movement constructed the modern Hakka identity. With the establishment of the Hakka Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Hakka Research Institute and the Hakka Academy, a large number of Hakka-related researches have emerged, which has led to many discussions and responses. Many Hakka studies since 2005 have pointed out that the ""Hakka"" identity consciousness of the entire Taiwanese Hakkas did not appear until the end of the 1980s Hakka movement construction; as early as the Qing Dynasty, there were already similar ""guests"", or "" The sense of identity of Yuedong and Yue people.
These new discoveries, which have long existed in the history of the Hakkas as a whole island, seem to pose some challenges to the previous study that the ""Pan-Taiwan Hakka Identity"" was constructed by the Hakka movement in the 1980s. The most obvious and important challenge is the particularity of the ""Hakka"" relative to other ethnic groups in Taiwan in the historical origins of the ethnic group: the ethnic group of ""outside the province"", ""indigenous people"" or ""well-being"" or The scope of the crowd seems to be the category or category of new people that emerged by contemporary actors through the ""common social position"" movement. Only the ""Hakka"", a holistic population, seems to have a long-term historical origin. And there are clearly visible special languages or cultures as the basis for group definition.
However, ""the identity of Hakka as a whole as a whole"" may have different natures and social significance or functions under the social context of different periods. Therefore, these new research findings give researchers the opportunity to revisit the following important research topics: the ""pan-Taiwan Hakka identity"" under the concept of modern ethnic group, and the traditional Hakka identity that existed in Taiwanese society before, in the nature of society, Are there any important differences in the scope and function of the operation?
The main purpose of this chapter is to begin to be noticed or newly unearthed by the researchers after the new research results of the past 10 years and the large number of Hakka studies, especially in the 20 years before the emergence of the Hakka Cultural Movement in 1987. The Hakka related literature in different regions of Taiwan, before and after the re-examination of the movement, the change in the content and nature of the Hakka identity constitutes an important problem of the classification of the population classification. In addition to examining the new research results on the formation of Hakka in the Qing Dynasty, this chapter will also specifically cite and discuss the study of the changes in the basic social patterns or social organization principles of Taiwan in the late Qing Dynasty and the Japanese occupation period, as well as the demonstration of traditional Hakka society since the war. The concept of the Hakka group, in the face of the new situation of modernization, has changed the concept of the group of Hakka people being “ethnicized”.
This chapter will analyze the ""Miaoyou"" and ""Central Plains"" magazines issued by the local Hakkas in the Miaoli area in the 1960s, and the ""Three Taiwan"" magazines founded by local Hakkas in the Miaoli area in the mid-1980s, and 1970. In the early days of the year, the ""Six Piles of Hakka Townships"" and the ""Six Piles"" published in the Liudui area of the southern high-screen area were analyzed and compared with the contents of ""Hakka Fengyun"" and ""Hakka Magazine"" published after 1987. Discuss the changes in the concept of ""Hakka group"" before and after the ""ethnicization"" of Hakka.

One of the early English translations of ""Hakka"" is the guest people. Its main image is the movement and migration of people in the historical process. When they arrive at the new land, they are relative to the ""guests"" who live in the land. As an academic monograph focusing on ""Taiwan Hakkas"", this book explores how Hakka people have settled in the new land in the history of Taiwan, settled down, flourished, and ""have become a Hakka in Taiwan.""
In the process of mobility and settlement, Hakka people face national policies, land development, and ethnic relations that continue to negotiate with the first-time residents, as well as major issues such as self/ethnic identity. Therefore, the eight papers selected in this book are based on the historical sequence of Qingling to modern times. The geographical balance of the South and North Hakka family groups is latitude. At the same time, it combines the research themes, methods and visions of history, anthropology and sociology to lead readers. Analyze the evolution of Taiwan Hakka culture.
