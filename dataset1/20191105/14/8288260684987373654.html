      <h1>The best Dyson hair dryer prices and deals for Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>The massively popular product was released last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:25:14+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Stacey Dutton</a></address>
      <p>With Christmas nearly here- we are all desperate to bag a bargain.</p>
      <p>Especially with products that are a little more costly this time of year like the Dyson Hair Dryer- retailers are starting to reduce the prices in time for the Black Friday huge price reductions.</p>
      <p>Usually shoppers are scouring the high street for reductions on TV's, furniture and other devices for Black Friday- so this is a nice gifting idea this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1531042&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.co.uk%2Fhair-care%2Fdyson-supersonic-blue-gold.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fbest-dyson-hair-dryer-prices-17177132">Dyson hair dryer</a> wowed shoppers on it's release last year, with tempting features including magnetic attachments, air multiplier technology and a digital motor which spins six times faster than other hair dryers.</p>
      <p>With the need for the popular product being huge on the high street- we thought we would compare prices and see where we can find the cheapest.</p>
      <p>Here are just some of the biggest retailers who stock them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2Nrm5X8">John Lewis</a> offer the Dyson in black, fuschia and gift edition for £299.99.</p>
      <p>But, it's a worthy buy at John Lewis - as it's the one department store who offer some of their <a href="https://fave.co/2Nrm5X8">Dyson product range</a> on interest free credit plans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=2041&amp;clickref=BMail-DysonBF&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2Felectrical%2Fhair-styling-tools%2Fhair-dryers%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-black-nickel-10254295%5D%5D">Boots</a> also stocks the trending range.</p>
      <p>Again at £299.99- the store has a price match promise on this product- AND Boots shoppers could use their advantage card to earn points on purchasing one.</p>

      <p>Shoppers can pick up the hair dryer for £299.99 BUT, you can use their credit payment plan for just £11.52 a month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2qdxNMP">Amazon</a> have labelled the Dyson as one of their "Amazon Choice" products- and it comes with £10 off if you want to get your hands on their Amazon Platinum Mastercard.</p>
      <p>So, for now the prices of the Dyson are staying put, BUT there are plenty of ways you can save at some of the stores above so it's not such a hefty blow around Christmas with a structured payment plan.</p>
