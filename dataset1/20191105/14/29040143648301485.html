      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>T-Mobile CEO John Legere has teased an Un-Carrier announcement for November 7.</li>
        <li>The announcement will be the first one since the T-Mobile merger with Sprint was approved by the FCC.</li>
        <li>It is uncertain what we might learn from the New T-Mobile Un-carrier 1.0 event, but most likely it will cover the carrier's 5G plans.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere loves a good tease, and he's at it again <a href="https://twitter.com/johnlegere/status/1191506830616186880?s=21">tweeting</a> out a cryptic save the date for November 7. That's the date Legere has chosen to make the next and very first Un-Carrier announcement since the T-Mobile merger with Sprint was <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-has-been-approved-fcc">approved</a> by the FCC.</p>

      <p>Despite making several Un-Carrier moves in the past, Legere is referring to this one as "the New T-Mobile Un-Carrier 1.0." I guess that makes sense when you consider this is the first move from the "New T-Mobile" which will now include Sprint.</p>
      <p>As for what we can expect from this next Un-Carrier move, it's hard to say. In the past, T-Mobile's Un-Carrier initiatives have included programs such as Netflix On Us, Binge On, T-Mobile Tuesdays, and more.</p>
      <p>Certainly, this one will include some information regarding Sprint. Whether that will be new plans, new pricing, or a transition of Sprint customers to New T-Mobile is anyone's guess.</p>
      <p>Most likely, we can look forward to learning more about New T-Mobile's plans for 5G and possibly more about T-Mobile's broadband internet service. After all, the main focus of the <a href="https://newtmobile.com/">New T-Mobile website</a> is "5G for all."</p>
      <p>Back in October, Legere had this to say about New T-Mobile during the Q3 2019 earnings call.</p>
      <blockquote>We've spent the better part of the last seven years changing wireless for good, and with the network capabilities of the new T-Mobile, we're going to take Un-carrier to an entirely new level. So, I think it's time we start sharing some of what we mean by next level.</blockquote>
      <p>Hopefully, the November 7 Un-Carrier announcement includes a lot more info than this tease and includes plans on offering more coverage for a lower price. At least, that's what T-Mobile has been promising since it first put into motion its plans to merge with Sprint.Â </p>
