      <p>The KwaZulu-Natal outfit has won five matches in a row in League and Cup respectively as they go to Bucs, who have had a stuttering start to the season due to inconsistent results. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Lorch will be serving a one-match suspension for four yellow cards, while Dube will be out for the first of two matches due to a sending off. </p>
      <p>Both players picked up their respective cards from the 4-2 penalty shootout defeat in Telkom Knockout match against rivals Kaizer Chiefs on the weekend.  </p>
      <p>“Mokwena and his assistants Fadlu Davids and Franck Plaine; will be without the services of some key players tonight. Right back Mthokozisi Dube is ruled out following his red card in the game against Amakhosi. The 27-year-old was sent off after his second bookable offence after impeding an opponent,” confirmed Pirates on the club’s official website.</p>
