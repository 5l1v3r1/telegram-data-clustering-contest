      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>’s comeback fight opponent has been agreed with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ufc">UFC</a>, according to the Irishman’s manager Audie Attar.</p>
      <p>‘The Notorious’ recently announced he will return to the Octagon on January 18 is Las Vegas but has so far failed to reveal who he would be facing.</p>
      <p>Attar says details of the match-up are close to being confirmed, however.</p>
      <p>"We had very productive talks this weekend with the UFC," he told <i>ESPN</i>.</p>
      <p>"I know Conor has announced a date, and in terms of discussions we have agreed on that date and we have agreed on that opponent.</p>

      <p>"We're not going to reveal anything tonight but a deal is imminent, I don't see anything getting in the way barring some unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>"Both parties want to get it done, it's in the best interests of everyone involved and more importantly the fans are really excited to see him back."</p>
      <p>Donald Cerrone is UFC bigwig Dana White’s preferred opponent for McGregor, in what will be his first bout since losing to Khabib Nurmagomedov last year.</p>

      <p>Attar believes the fight makes sense but refused to confirm if ‘Cowboy’ is the unnamed opponent.</p>
      <p>He said: "I like the Cerrone matchup, I like how he's building it himself and he's a fan favourite, he's a guy that comes to fight, he throws down and he deserves a fight like that.</p>
      <p>"From a business standpoint, lets see how this plays out."</p>
      <p>McGregor outlined his plan for the season at last month’s press conference in Russia.</p>
      <p>After his comeback fight, the 31-year-old fancies a crack at Jorge Masvidal after his win against Nate Diaz at UFC 244, before rounding off 2020 with a rematch against Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>And Attar said: "Conor is really committed to this 'season' where he will fight three times this year, he really wants to get back into the groove of things.</p>
      <p>"He wants to get back to what he really loves aside from the businesses that we love and we should have an announcement in the coming weeks."</p>
