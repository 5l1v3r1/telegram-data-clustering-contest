AI randomizes and animates scenes from a single image
05 Nov 2019, 14:56 by Rob Beschizza



SinGAN is a generative AI that can, among other things, create random variations of an image (or animate it) without knowing what it is an image of. The official implementation is on Github and shows pretty landscapes:



It can also accomplish useful design tasks such as harmonizing color gradients and adding illusory resolution to blurred images.



But I feel that a humorous yet disquieting portrait of the President of the United States of America is in order, courtesy of Jonathan Fly.
