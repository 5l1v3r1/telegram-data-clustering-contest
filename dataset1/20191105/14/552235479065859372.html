      <p>An anxious pet owner has launched an appeal for the return of her pet snake.</p>

      <p>She believes the snake, called Lillith, escaped her enclosure in Burns Park in Calderwood on October 28.</p>

      <p>And she admits she is “terrified” the snake may have made it out of the house and “possibly into someone else’s”.</p>
      <p>Aryanne told us: “I know the fear and panic people have when it comes to loose snakes, which is why I am even more afraid something bad will happen to her if she has escaped the house.</p>
      <p>“Lillith is a very distinctive looking snake – I have looked everywhere and I think going public is my only other option to make people aware she might be around.”</p>

      <p>Aryanne has had her beloved pet for six-months. Lillith is still a baby at around eight-months-old. <br/>Aryanne added: “She has a neurological disorder that comes with her genetics that makes her confused with her orientation and surroundings.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes she thinks she’s upside down and is very clumsy, so she’s very special to me.” <br/>If Lillith is out of the house, she would be looking for somewhere warm and cramped to curl up in. She is very friendly and very shy too.</p>
      <p>“She is completely non-venomous and has never bitten or tried to strike at a human.”</p>
