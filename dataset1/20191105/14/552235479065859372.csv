And she admits she is “terrified” the snake may have made it out of the house and “possibly into someone else’s”.
Aryanne told us: “I know the fear and panic people have when it comes to loose snakes, which is why I am even more afraid something bad will happen to her if she has escaped the house.
“Lillith is a very distinctive looking snake – I have looked everywhere and I think going public is my only other option to make people aware she might be around.”

Aryanne has had her beloved pet for six-months. Lillith is still a baby at around eight-months-old. Aryanne added: “She has a neurological disorder that comes with her genetics that makes her confused with her orientation and surroundings.
“Sometimes she thinks she’s upside down and is very clumsy, so she’s very special to me.” If Lillith is out of the house, she would be looking for somewhere warm and cramped to curl up in. She is very friendly and very shy too.
“She is completely non-venomous and has never bitten or tried to strike at a human.”
