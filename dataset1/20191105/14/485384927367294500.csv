Here's what Airbnb's party house crackdown could mean for your next stay

05 Nov 2019, 14:59

Airbnb announced a ban on ""party houses"" at the weekend following a shooting at a Californian rental on Halloween in which five people were killed.
In a series of tweets, co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky said Airbnb ""must do better, and we will"".



But what does this mean if you're planning on booking a short-term rental?
Here's what we know about the crackdown.
How are guests currently vetted?

In order to book on Airbnb, users have to share their full name, provide an email address and confirmed number, write an introductory message, agree to house rules and provide payment information.
From there, Airbnb says it scores every reservation for risk before confirming them.
On top of this, it runs its hosts and guests against regulatory, terrorist and sanctions watchlists.
They also conduct background checks on guests and hosts in the United States.
Meanwhile, hosts are asked to set clear expectations and requirements for guests, read their profiles and reviews, ""get to know [their] guests in advance"", and keep safety information and equipment handy in order to help keep themselves and their properties safe.
Airbnb's terms of service say guests have to leave the accommodation in the condition it was in when they arrived.
If guests book services on behalf of additional guests, they have to make sure every additional guest meets any requirements set by the host, and is aware of Airbnb's terms and the host's rules and restrictions.
So, Airbnb guests are responsible for everything that happens in the property while they're renting it, and this means following the host's rules.
What has changed?
Mr Chesky outlined three key issues on Twitter. He said Airbnb would:

Expand manual screening of high-risk reservations
Create a dedicated ""party house"" rapid response team
Take immediate action against users who violate the new guest policies (including removal)

These changes are effective immediately, according to Mr Chesky. And the ABC understands they will apply to listings worldwide, including Australia.
But what does this mean?

Manual screening technology is already used by the platform to score reservations for risk before they are confirmed.
""We use predictive analytics and machine learning to instantly evaluate hundreds of signals that help us flag and investigate suspicious activity before it happens,"" it said.
According to Airbnb this process is going to be expanded, which means your booking will likely be scrutinised even more than it already is, particularly if it happens to be a booking for a large house for, say, one night, as it was reported.
They'll also be looking at hosts who allow their homes to become long-term nuisances to their neighbourhoods.
As for the other two changes, it's still unclear exactly how they will be implemented. Airbnb have not clarified what would be classified as a ""party house"".
Wait… so an Airbnb SWAT team could break up my party?
That doesn't appear to be the case. So if you're envisioning a SWAT team arriving on the doorstep, dragging unruly guests from properties, you've probably gotten a little carried away.
But Airbnb are yet to clarify exactly what this rapid response team would be responsible for. We should know more about what the response team will involve in the next week or so.
For now, the company's working on ""reviewing and accelerating the development and implementation of these new safety initiatives"", Mr Chesky explained.



The VP of trust has a 10-day deadline…
… to come back with more info.
Margaret Richardson, Airbnb's vice-president of trust — yes, really — has been tasked with overseeing the new team.
Mr Chesky says she's been given 10 days to develop and implement the new safety initiatives.
The takeaway?
If you're found to be in a ""party house"", it appears you'll probably be kicked out immediately.
Of course, unauthorised parties were always banned under Airbnb's company policy.
But the updated policy is more a ""redoubling"" of Airbnb's efforts to stop them from happening, in Mr Chesky's words.
But we've still got some questions…
It's unclear what would constitute a party house. We're also unsure who would make up the rapid response team and whether they could kick you out of the Airbnb property.
And it's not known if the new policy will mean hosts and/or guests would be removed from the website, rental, or both, for breaching the rules.
