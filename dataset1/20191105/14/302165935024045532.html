      <p>LONDON, Nov 5 — German tennis great Boris Becker has had his bankruptcy restrictions extended to 2031 after an investigation into assets and undisclosed transactions valued at more than £4.5 million (RM23.9 million).</p>
      <p>Becker, who won six Grand Slam singles titles in his career including three at Wimbledon, was made bankrupt on June 21, 2017 in the London High Court.</p>
      <p>Under the terms of the bankruptcy order, the 51-year-old was bound to provide full disclosure of assets to the trustee and inform any lenders of his situation when seeking to borrow more than 500 pounds.</p>
      <p>Restrictions are usually lifted after one year.</p>
      <p>“Owing to the nature of Boris Becker’s actions, the Official Receiver pursued extended restrictions to prevent Mr Becker causing further harm to his creditors,” Britain’s Insolvency Service said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>“Mr Becker offered a Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking, which was accepted on 17 October 2019 and lasts until 16 October 2031.”</p>
      <p>It said the transactions investigated by the receiver occurred before and after the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
      <p>An online auction of Becker’s trophies and memorabilia in July raised more than £680,000, with his 1989 US Open trophy attracting the highest bid of £150,250.</p>
      <p>The auction had been due in 2018 but was delayed after Becker claimed diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy proceedings by taking up a role with Central African Republic as a sports envoy. — Reuters</p>
