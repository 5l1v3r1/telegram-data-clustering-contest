《習慣致富》：從財務不穩定到財務豐饒，你在「財富金字塔」的哪一層？
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是如果你處於第一層，那麼目標應該是將更多現金流量轉移到資產，並建構一台投資「自動提款機」，如此一來，你的收入就不需要你付出更多努力。



文：湯姆．柯利（Tom Corley）、麥可．雅德尼（Michael Yardney）
你在財富金字塔的哪一層？
現在來探討你目前在財富金字塔中的位置。
不久前，擁有房屋的偉大夢想，被認為是為退休生活準備資金的一種方式。
問問嬰兒潮世代（指的是出生於一九四六至六四年的人）的任何一個人，他們會告訴你，父母教他們要好好接受教育、找一份安穩的工作、買房子、還清貸款，然後，看吧，你安排好了黃金歲月的生活！
呃……真的不是那麼簡單。我們需要一棟以上的房子來為退休生活準備資金，尤其是你無法指望政府或養老金計畫來照顧你的時候。
當然，在晚年不用背負房債的情況下擁有自己的房屋是個好的開始，但你也需要設定一些投資目標和時間表。
為了幫助你了解未來有什麼，我們來看看雅德尼的模式之一：財富金字塔。下面這張圖指出你在邁向財務獨立的路上位於哪一層，以及哪些關鍵的焦點領域和槓桿點，好加快你的旅程。你可以用它來評估現在所處位置及想去的地方。
和所有金字塔一樣，它有一個很寬的底，愈往上愈窄；換句話說，大多數人處於財富光譜的較低層，達到頂層的人較少。
但願你從本書學到的知識和技能幫助你爬向金字塔頂層，但你從一層爬上另一層需要的解決方案，將依你在金字塔的位置而有所不同。遺憾的是，大多數人其實沒什麼財富，因此都困在第一層。

第零層：財務不穩定
大多數人從一個發薪日活到下一個發薪日，這就是所謂的財務不穩定。萬一失去工作，或者遇到緊急情況（你曉得這些事情不斷冒出來，像是生病、汽車壞了、冰箱掛點），他們根本沒有財務預備金來應對。
由於零層的人沒有閒餘的財務能力，應付這些重擔的唯一方法就是借更多錢（又加重了債務負擔），而這只會使財務更困難。他們把頭埋在沙裡過活，沒有真正意識到金錢和他們的支出習慣。
他們一有錢就花掉，沒錢就會去借，因為他們最喜歡的消遣是購物，以及購買不是真正需要的「東西」，這表示他們背負的不少債務都用在這些東西上。他們繼續這麼做，而且自欺欺人，認為只要更努力工作，終有一天會還清債務。
如果你問他們問題出在哪裡，他們會告訴你，他們賺的錢不夠用。他們認為，更多的錢可以解決他們的問題。但那種說法是不對的。他們最大的問題在於金錢習慣，而這和收入多寡無關。這和他們如何處理賺來的錢有關。他們在人生中前進，賺更多的錢，卻也花更多的錢。今天，他們沒辦法靠五年前只能夢想得到的那種所得過日子。
有許多高所得者落入這一類，因為他們花的錢和賺的錢一樣多或更多。沒錯，有些第零層財富的人士看起來有錢——他們甚至可能住豪宅或開名車，卻也背負巨額貸款，還款還得焦頭爛額。更遺憾的是，他們經常為了錢和另一半爭吵，否定財務狀況，並且合理化自己為什麼要買這個或那個東西。
第零層實際上可以分為兩個子群：
一、焦頭爛額：我們如此稱呼金字塔最底層的人，因為他們是金錢遊戲的受害者。他們每個月似乎都發現自己的處境比上個月更糟，通常是因為濫用信用卡，讓債務愈陷愈深。他們現在用明天的錢支付今天的高利率。他們當然會把自己的問題怪罪於別人，因為這絕不是他們的「錯」。他們經常閱讀有關預算編列的書，或者聽信他人說要剪掉信用卡，但那完全沒用。他們不知道如何「處理」錢。接著，在金字塔往上半層是……
二、苟延殘喘：他們是受雇者、自力營生者，甚至是企業人士，每個月似乎賺到足夠的錢，卻什麼也沒留下。而且，如果偶然間銀行帳戶有點錢，他們會花掉或拿去度假。他們只是苟延殘喘而已。
第零層的人入不敷出是事實，而造成問題的真正原因則是他們否定這個事實。除非他們準備改變，否則他們的財務未來是黯淡的。
擺脫這一層的根本關鍵是心態、教育和負起財務責任。
第一層：財務穩定
這是最基本的財富水準，能夠給你某種程度的財務保障或穩定，也就是有下列狀況：
一、你已經累積足夠的流動資產（例如對沖帳戶［offset account］的錢、信用額度或儲蓄。「對沖帳戶」是澳洲銀行推出的獨特貸款方式，帳戶持有者可以隨時存錢和提錢，並利用帳戶裡的錢繳還貸款，進而抵銷貸款利息。），以支應當前的生活費用至少六個月。
二、你有私人的醫療險和壽險，一旦久病臥床、殘疾、無力工作，或者最壞的情況——突然死亡，可以保護你和家人的生活方式。
在這一層你可以安心，萬一人生遭逢任何意外，例如公司裁員、事業經營失敗、生病或殘疾，你和家人的生活方式不致受到過度傷害。你將有足夠時間尋找新的收入來源，讓自己重回正軌。
這一層的問題在於你的現金流量由他人控制，例如老闆支付你的薪資或客戶支付你提供的服務，這表示你仍得做牛做馬，而且沒辦法在不多工作的情況下增加現金流量，就算能增加也有上限。當然你得到了一點財務緩衝，但如果停止工作一段時間，就會跌回第零層。
如果你處於第一層，那麼目標應該是將更多現金流量轉移到資產，並建構一台投資「自動提款機」，如此一來，你的收入就不需要你付出更多努力。
然而在繼續談下去之前，我們再多解釋一下到底什麼是自動提款機。
早在一九八○年代初，雅德尼那時的商業夥伴布萊恩（Brian）就告訴他：「雅德尼，我想要一台自動提款機！」
「你在說什麼？」他回答。
布萊恩解釋：「你知道啊，就是自動提款機。我希望早上來工作時按下開關，機器就開始運轉並吐出錢來。一天結束時關掉開關，回家享受天倫之樂，隔天回來再按下開關。這台機器會再度開始運轉，吐出更多的錢。」
你可以想像雅德尼是這麼說的：「我當然也想要有自動提款機。」誰不想要一台呢？
儘管這在當時似乎是個相當荒謬的白日夢，但多年來雅德尼確實打造出一台，一個規模相當大的房地產投資組合。這使得他每年有機會和家人共度兩個長假；他因為想工作而工作，而不是因為必須工作，而且能夠回饋社區、慈善機構和家庭。
我們猜測你也想要台自動提款機，不是嗎？為什麼不要？如果你隨著時間明智地投資，將能建立自己的龐大資產基礎，而那就會成為你的自動提款機。這需要投入時間、心力、走出舒適圈，並且承受一點風險，而這和你日常工作賺到多少收入無關。我們見過許多人一年賺進數十萬美元，卻將大部分錢花在華而不實的生活方式上，結果沒有變富有。
話雖如此，我們也看到成功的投資人建立起龐大的房地產投資或股票投資組合，同時從事有些人稱為枯燥卑微的日常工作，收入相當少。換句話說，他們的工作成了他們選擇去做的事，不是為了主要的收入來源而非做不可。是的，就是為了打造自己的自動提款機。
在這一層，你的最大槓桿來自投資自己和精通財務、培養穩健的財務和投資技能基礎，藉以壯大你的財務未來，並開始建立一張同儕網，在這趟旅程攜手同行。
你也必須選擇致力於精通的第一種投資工具，當個認真的學生，盡你所能學習這個利基財富工具。雅德尼顯然認為，大多數人的最佳起點是住宅用房地產投資。
在決定選用哪種財富工具時，你必須養成紀律，對其他的「大好機會」和方法堅定說不。我們對二流投資機會說「不」所賺到的錢，多於對它們說「好」，然後仔細選擇你要向誰學習。和一般的看法恰好相反，最貴的教育不是像頒授企業管理碩士（MBA）學位那樣的研究所；最貴的教育是根據有缺陷的模式和不正確的資訊。最難的學習形式，是消除你從不合格老師那裡「學到」的所有錯誤、誤導和有缺陷的知識。所以要選擇向最優秀的人學習，這會省下你遵循有缺陷模式所挫折的許多年。
第二層：財務安全
在你積聚了充分資產，能產生足夠的被動收入以支應最基本開銷之後，就實現了財務安全。基本開銷包括以下幾項：

你的房屋抵押貸款和所有的房屋相關費用，例如水電費、利率和稅款。
你繳納的所有稅款，以及貸款和債務的利息支出。
你的汽車支出。
你的雜貨帳單和最低生活費用。
任何保險費，包括醫療、人壽、殘疾和你的房子。

當你達到財務安全這一層便可以不再工作，卻仍能維持簡單、基本的生活方式。不過，你當然會想要更多。
在第二層，你將是投資人，專注於擁有會增值的資產，建立個人的財富淨值。
在第二層的高階階段，你將開始從資本利得投資轉為被動性、剩餘現金流量投資。這表示你必須精通一整套全新的技能。你也必須急劇升級你的顧問網和同儕群。在小池塘當條大魚不再適合你，你需要開始和比自己更好的人一起玩。
第三層：財務自由
當你累積了充足資產，能夠產生足夠的被動收入以支應渴望的生活方式（不一定是目前的生活方式）和所有開銷，不必再外出工作，你便知道自己獲得了財務自由。
先建立起龐大的資產基礎（房地產、股票或企業）之後，現在你正在使用這些資產去創造現金流量，但不表示你不會再度工作，只是現在你能做想要的選擇，因為你有自由。
在第三層，你關注的焦點應該是穩定被動收入流，並且微調你的財產規畫和資產保護。現在也是尋找擴大貢獻方式、增加回饋世界的大好時機。
第三層不談「退休」，而是談再生和捐獻。
第四層：財務豐饒
世界上有一小群人在他們的投資自動提款機一夜之間實現時，便取得財務豐饒。他們不只沒有財務壓力，在支應生活開銷、所有費用及對社區的奉獻（通常透過慈善工作或捐贈）之後，還有不少剩餘收入，所以他們的資產基礎不斷增長。
關於財富金字塔，最後要說幾句話。這種財富層級其實沒什麼新意，它一直都存在，我們始終是它的一部分。抱怨你所在的位置無濟於事，但你的財富水準是你選擇的結果。儘管如此，大多數人都卡在特定的層級，投資從來沒有成功過。
你需要問自己的主要問題是：你是否計畫採用富習慣來致富，或者打算繼續當窮人？
所以，但願你現在更了解為什麼我們希望你致富。富有能夠給你選擇。它讓你過個更美好、更充實的生活，一種在每個可能的面向都富有的生活。

""Getting used to getting rich"": From financial instability to financial abundance, which layer of the ""Fortune Pyramid"" are you?
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that if you are on the first level, then the goal should be to transfer more cash flow to the assets and construct an investment ""automated teller machine"", so that your income does not require you. Pay more effort.



Text: Tom. Tom Corley, Michael. Michael Yardney
Which layer of the pyramid of wealth are you?
Now let's explore your current position in the Fortune Pyramid.
Not long ago, the great dream of owning a home was considered a way to prepare funds for retirement.
Ask any of the baby boomers (referring to people born in 1946-64) who will tell you that parents teach them to be educated, find a safe job, buy a house, and Clear the loan, then, look, you have arranged the golden years of life!
Uh... It’s not that simple. We need more than one house to prepare for retirement, especially if you can't count on the government or pension plan to take care of you.
Of course, having your own home in the absence of a mortgage in your later years is a good start, but you also need to set some investment goals and timetables.
To help you understand what's in the future, let's take a look at one of Yardney's models: the Fortune Pyramid. The picture below shows where you are on the road to financial independence and what key focus areas and leverage points are available to speed up your journey. You can use it to assess where you are now and where you want to go.
Like all pyramids, it has a wide base that is narrower as it goes up; in other words, most people are at the lower levels of the wealth spectrum, with fewer people reaching the top.
I hope that the knowledge and skills you have learned from this book will help you climb to the top of the pyramid, but the solution you need to climb from one layer to another will vary depending on where you are in the pyramid. Unfortunately, most people don't have much wealth, so they are stuck on the first floor.

Level 0: Financial instability
Most people live from one payday to the next payday, which is called financial instability. In the event of a loss of work or an emergency (you know that these things are constantly emerging, like illness, broken cars, refrigerators), they have no financial reserves to deal with.
Since the zero-tiered people do not have the financial ability to spare, the only way to cope with these burdens is to borrow more money (which adds to the debt burden), which only makes finance more difficult. They buried their heads in the sand and lived without real awareness of money and their spending habits.
They spend it when they have money, and they borrow it when they have no money, because their favorite pastime is shopping, and buying ""things"" that are not really needed, which means that many of the debts they carry are used on these things. They continue to do this, and they are deceiving themselves, thinking that as long as they work harder, they will pay off their debts one day.
If you ask them where the problem is, they will tell you that they are not making enough money. They believe that more money can solve their problems. But that kind of argument is wrong. Their biggest problem is the money habit, which has nothing to do with the amount of income. This is related to how they deal with the money they earn. They are moving forward in life, making more money, but also spending more money. Today, they can't live with the kind of income they could only dream of five years ago.
There are many high-income people who fall into this category because they spend as much or more as they make. Yes, some people with zero-level wealth seem to have money – they may even live in luxury homes or drive a car, but they also carry huge loans and repay their debts. What's more, they often quarrel with money for the other half, negate the financial situation, and rationalize why they want to buy this or that thing.
The zeroth layer can actually be divided into two subgroups:
First, the burnt head: We call people at the bottom of the pyramid, because they are victims of money games. Every month they seem to find themselves in a worse position than last month, usually because they abuse credit cards and make debts deeper and deeper. They are now paying today's high interest rates with tomorrow's money. Of course, they will blame others for their problems, because this is by no means their ""wrong."" They often read books about budgets, or listen to others saying they want to cut credit cards, but that's completely useless. They don't know how to ""handle"" money. Then, in the upper half of the pyramid is...
Second, lingering: they are employed, self-employed, and even business people, seem to earn enough money each month, but nothing left. Moreover, if the bank account is a little bit of money by chance, they will spend it or take it on vacation. They are just lingering.
It is a fact that people on the zeroth floor cannot make ends meet, and the real cause of the problem is that they deny this fact. Unless they are ready to change, their financial future is bleak.
The key to getting rid of this layer is mentality, education and financial responsibility.
The first layer: financial stability
This is the most basic level of wealth and can give you some level of financial security or stability, that is, the following conditions:
1. You have accumulated enough liquid assets (such as money, credit limit or savings for the hedge account). The “hedging account” is a unique loan method introduced by the Australian bank. The account holder can save and withdraw money at any time. And use the money in the account to pay the loan, and then offset the loan interest.), to support the current living expenses for at least six months.
Second, you have private medical insurance and life insurance. Once you are sick, bedridden, disabled, unable to work, or the worst case - sudden death, you can protect the lifestyle of you and your family.
At this level you can be assured that in the event of any accident in your life, such as company layoffs, failed business operations, illness or disability, the lifestyle of you and your family will not be overly harmed. You will have enough time to find a new source of income and get yourself back on track.
The problem with this layer is that your cash flow is controlled by others, such as the boss paying your salary or the customer paying for the service you provide, which means you still have to do the job, and there is no way to increase cash flow without working too much. Even if there is an increase, there is an upper limit. Of course you get a little financial buffer, but if you stop working for a while, you will fall back to the zeroth floor.
If you are on the first level, then the goal should be to transfer more cash flow to the assets and build an investment ""automated teller machine"", so that your income does not require you to work harder.
However, before we continue to talk, let us explain more about what is an ATM.
As early as the early 1980s, Yardney’s business partner Brian told him: “Yardney, I want an ATM!”
""What are you talking about?"" he replied.
Brian explained: ""You know, it's an ATM. I want to press the switch when I come to work in the morning, the machine starts to run and spit out money. Turn off the switch at the end of the day, go home and enjoy the fun of the family, the next day. Come back and press the switch. This machine will start running again and spit out more money.""
You can imagine what Yardini said: ""Of course I want to have an ATM."" Who doesn't want one?
Although this seemed to be a rather ridiculous daydream at the time, Yardney has indeed built a large-scale real estate portfolio for many years. This gives him the opportunity to spend two long holidays with his family each year; he works because he wants to work, not because he has to work, and he can give back to the community, charities and families.
We guess you also want an ATM, aren't you? Why not? If you invest wisely over time, you will be able to build your own vast asset base and that will be your ATM. This requires investing time, effort, getting out of the comfort zone, and taking a little risk, which has nothing to do with how much income you earn from your daily work. We have seen many people earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but they spend most of their money on a slick lifestyle, and the results are not rich.
Having said that, we have also seen successful investors building large real estate investments or stock portfolios, while at the same time engaging in some of the daily work that some people call boring and humble, with very little income. In other words, their work is what they choose to do, not for the main source of income, not for doing it. Yes, just to build your own ATM.
At this level, your biggest leverage comes from investing in yourself and being proficient in finance, developing a solid financial and investment skills base to grow your financial future, and start building a peer-to-peer network.
You must also choose the first investment tool that is committed to proficiency. Be a serious student and try your best to learn this niche wealth tool. Yardini clearly believes that the best starting point for most people is residential real estate investment.
When deciding which wealth tool to use, you must develop discipline and say no to other ""good opportunities"" and methods. We say ""no"" to second-rate investment opportunities to earn more money than to say ""good"" to them, and then carefully choose who you want to learn. Contrary to the general view, the most expensive education is not the same as the award of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree; the most expensive education is based on flawed models and incorrect information. The hardest form of learning is to eliminate all the mistakes, misleading and flawed knowledge you have learned from unqualified teachers. So choosing to learn from the best people will save you years of frustration following the flawed model.
Second layer: financial security
Financial security is achieved after you have accumulated sufficient assets to generate enough passive income to cover the most basic expenses. The basic costs include the following:

Your home mortgage and all home related expenses, such as utilities, interest rates and taxes.
All taxes you pay, as well as interest payments on loans and debts.
Your car spends.
Your grocery bill and minimum living expenses.
Any insurance premiums, including medical, life, disability and your house.

When you reach the level of financial security, you can stop working, but still maintain a simple, basic lifestyle. However, of course you will want more.
On the second level, you will be an investor, focusing on owning assets that will add value and building a personal net worth.
In the high-level stage of the second tier, you will begin to shift from capital gains investments to passive, residual cash flow investments. This means you have to be proficient in a whole new set of skills. You must also dramatically upgrade your advisory network and peer group. In the small pond, when the big fish is no longer suitable for you, you need to start playing with people who are better than yourself.
The third layer: financial freedom
When you accumulate enough assets to generate enough passive income to support the desired lifestyle (not necessarily the current lifestyle) and all the expenses, you don't have to go out to work, you know you have gained financial freedom.
After building a huge asset base (real estate, stocks, or business), you are now using these assets to create cash flow, but it doesn't mean you won't work again, but now you can make the choice you want because you have freedom. .
On the third level, your focus should be on stabilizing passive income streams and fine-tuning your property planning and asset protection. Now is also a good time to find ways to expand your contribution and increase your return to the world.
The third layer does not talk about ""retirement,"" but about regeneration and donation.
The fourth layer: financial abundance
A small group of people in the world have achieved financial abundance when they realize their investment ATMs overnight. Not only do they have no financial pressure, they have a lot of residual income after they have spent their living expenses, all their expenses and dedication to the community (usually through charity work or donations), so their asset base is growing.
With regard to the pyramid of wealth, I have to say a few words at the end. This level of wealth is nothing new, it always exists, and we are always part of it. Complaining about your location doesn't help, but your wealth level is the result of your choice. Still, most people are stuck at a particular level and investment has never been successful.
The main question you need to ask yourself is: Do you plan to use rich habits to get rich, or plan to continue to be poor?
So, I hope you know more about why we want you to get rich now. Rich can give you choice. It allows you to live a better and more fulfilling life, a life that is rich in every possible aspect.

Do you often feel that you are always two bags empty and live very scared? Always wonder why rich people are getting more and more money? What should I do to get myself into the ranks of rich and successful people? As long as you develop 30 rich habits, rich life is coming soon!

How do rich people think about money differently from ordinary people?


Rich people think about taking money to invest / ordinary people think about how to spend money
Rich people think about making more money with money / ordinary people worry that money will spend
Rich people work to satisfy self/general work is to make money
Rich people embrace change / ordinary people are afraid to change
Rich people believe that wealth is what they deserve / ordinary people believe that rich people are lucky
Rich people know that IQ is not related to getting rich. Most people think that good education and intelligence can get rich.
Rich people know that they can use other people's money to get rich. Most people believe that they have money to make money.
Rich people teach children how to be rich / how people teach their children how to survive

If your thoughts are the same as the average person, it's time to change! Start with a good habit of cultivating to success:

Read 30 minutes a day
Exercise 30 minutes a day
Focus on dreams and goals every day
10% of income is saved first
Never give up on your dreams

...Open the book, there are more rich habits, learn together!
