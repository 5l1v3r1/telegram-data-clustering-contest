Donald Trump Jr. identifies his favorite Democrat: Mitt Romney
05 Nov 2019, 14:59 by Tim Pearce
Donald Trump, Jr. joked that Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is his favorite Democrat.
Trump appeared on CBS on Tuesday morning to talk about his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. Host Gayle King attempted to get Trump to compliment a political opponent by asking him to name his favorite Democrat.
The president's son demurred on the question at first. King then began to move the show along to the next segment on the weather when Trump quipped, ""Mitt Romney, Gayle. Mitt Romney is my favorite Democrat. How about that?""
After laughing, King wagged her finger at Trump and told him his answer doesn’t count.



Romney, 72, has served as Utah's junior senator since January 2019 and is one of the leading Republican critics of President Trump. A poll released Sunday found that Romney is seen favorably by just 18% of Americans, a significant drop-off from 43% in October 2012 before he lost his presidential bid against then-President Barack Obama.
Trump's book was released on Tuesday after his father touted the book on Twitter on Monday.
""My son, @DonaldJTrumpJr is coming out with a new book, 'Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us' – available tomorrow, November 5th! A great new book that I highly recommend for ALL to read. Go order it today!"" Trump wrote.
