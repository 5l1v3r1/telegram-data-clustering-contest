      <h1>Kieran Tierney finds his Arsenal answer to Patrick Roberts as he channels Scott Brown tradition</h1>
      <h2>The left-back is out of the Scotland squad again but he's now a fully fledged member of Unai Emery's side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:54:03+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Kieran Tierney continued to train with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> on Tuesday - and it appears he has a new pal in David Luiz.</p>
      <p>The left-back was present at London Colney after Steve Clarke revealed the Gunners had requested he be left out of the Scotland squad amid an "ongoing issue".</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> defender has been carefully managed since his £25million summer move having missed much of last season through injury.</p>
      <p>But he's now made six appearances totalling 427 minutes in the past month, including starts in Arsenal's last two Premier League fixtures.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Clarke</a> admits he's frustrated by the left-back's absence as he looks to build momentum ahead of next year's Nations League play-offs.</p>
      <p>He said: "Kieran’s got an ongoing issue that Arsenal are keen to address in the next international break and Arsenal asked us not to select him.</p>

      <p>“It’s a little bit frustrating and it’s obviously frustrating for Kieran as well."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Tierney</a> was pictured making his way onto the pitch, alongside team-mates Luiz and Gabriel Martinelli.</p>
      <p>In the former, perhaps he finally has a replacement, albeit an unlikely one, for Patrick Roberts.</p>
      <p>The two were inseparable at Celtic's Lennoxtown base and their friendship was a theme of Roberts' loan spell in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Also a feature was Tierney's refusal to wear anything but short sleeves, even in the thick of Scottish winter, in the same vein as captain Scott Brown.</p>
      <p>While team-mates donned gloves on tights, that London weather should be comparatively tropical to the hills of East Dunbartonshire for the Scot.</p>
      <p>Despite another Scotland omission, Tierney has insisted he's fully committed long-term, previously revealing all parties were on board with his decision to sit out the last international break.</p>
      <p>He said in October: "What I’m doing isn’t against Scotland, it’s for the future of my Scotland career. I need to help my body and make sure that I am in the best place possible for the next camp - that’s what it’s all about.</p>
      <p>“I understand it, Arsenal understand it and Scotland understand it."</p>
      <p>But Tierney is not yet ready and it appears Arsenal are continuing to manage the 22-year-old's workload</p>
      <p>The Gunners' Europa League participation ensures a heavy schedule and come Saturday evening he could feasibly have played three times in a week.</p>
