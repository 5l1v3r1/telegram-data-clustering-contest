      <p>A mural by mysterious street artist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/banksy-who-is-artist-secret-likely-candidates-names-public-sothebys-auction-a8590041.html">Banksy</a> has been uncovered in Notting Hill.</p>
      <p>The artwork – depicting an artist with an easel writing “Banksy” in big red letters – has been obscured by scaffolding on the corner of Acklam and Portobello Road since 2008.</p>
      <p>It has several names, including <i>The Graffiti Painter</i>,<i> The Painter </i>or<i> Velazquez</i>, after Spanish artist Diego Velazquez.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the piece ahead of its unveiling, Simon Lyons – capital chief executive of Enstar, the company behind the refurbishment – told Reuters: “It is a lovely feature for the building and a lovely feature in Notting Hill, which has retained its Londonness.”</p>
      <p>He said the mural was “one of the reasons [he] bought the building,” adding that it gave the luxury flats “that iconic profile”.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the building works, Enstar considered moving the artwork but decided there was too much risk. It’ll stay in the same spot, but will be floodlit and covered by glass.</p>
