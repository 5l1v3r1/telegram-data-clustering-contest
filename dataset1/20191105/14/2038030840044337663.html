      <p>Cape Town - Trevor Noah shared an interesting take on marriage.</p>
      <p>During an interview on <a href="https://www.howardstern.com/show/2019/11/4/video-trevor-noah-reveals-why-he-cant-stop-working-how-he-learned-deal-anger-advice-dave-chappelle/"><b>The Howard Stern Show</b></a> on Monday, the 35-year-old discussed his dating life and whether he’ll ever get married.</p>
      <p>“I’m not opposed to (marriage),” he says.</p>
      <p>Host Howard Stern (65) asked Trevor when he’ll “calm down with work” and he responded by saying that work is what he’s learned to enjoy.</p>
      <p>“I can only know where I am now in life, and that’s what I’ve learned to enjoy.”</p>
      <p>The comedian then spoke about being against people living together when they’re married, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/trevor-noah-marriage-living-together"><b>FOX News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>“I’m a big advocate for not living together ever, even if you’re married,” he revealed.</p>
      <p>“I think one of the biggest reasons people get divorced and relationships break up is because of this cohabiting bulls**t that we’ve come to believe is the way relationships are supposed to be.”</p>
