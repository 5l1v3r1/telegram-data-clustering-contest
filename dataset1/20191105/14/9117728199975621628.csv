Mercedes opt for conservative tyre approach for 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix
05 Nov 2019, 14:41 by Bobby Vincent

Mercedes have opted for a more conservative tyre approach for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix next weekend, as they look for their third victory in a row.

At the weekend, we saw another (nearly!) tyre masterclass from Lewis Hamilton, as he went for the one-stop strategy as opposed to Valtteri Bottas (eventual race-winner) and Max Verstappen (third-place), who were both on two-stop strategies.
It's the penultimate race of the season next weekend in Brazil and Mercedes (and McLaren) have both opted to take just eight sets of the C3 softs.
However, the likes of Ferrari, Red Bull, Haas, Renault and Racing Point will all take the full sets of the red-banded rubber compounds, bringing 10 to Interlagos, with Williams, Alfa Romeo and Toro Rosso all taking nine sets of the soft.
