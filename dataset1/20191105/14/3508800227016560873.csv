《編輯這種病》：她那些被丈夫揮拳打落的門牙，從來就沒有去補過
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是「請你一定要回電話給我。我想跟以前的老朋友們問候聊聊。」就這樣，我並沒有再打過電話給她。大約3個月後，我看到曾任《寫真時代》總編輯的末井昭所寫的編輯後記，才知道她已經自殺。



文：見城徹
鈴木泉美──最後的問候
我依稀記得那是在冬末的深夜時分，我和女性朋友講電話講得正起勁，那個聲音插撥進來。
「我是鈴木泉美，請問是見城先生嗎？」
這個沒有高低起伏的聲音，讓人一聽就認出是誰。
霎時，我突然覺得麻煩上門。一來我和女性友人正講到興頭上，二來鈴木泉美數年前的電話攻勢，說真的讓我想逃之夭夭。我告訴鈴木泉美，自己正在講電話，她是插播進來的。接著，因為我已把她的電話號碼從記事本裡刪除，因此我再次向她詢問了電話號碼，並說稍後再回電給她，便把電話掛斷了。
至今我還清楚記得她那時候說的話。她是這麼說的：
「請你一定要回電話給我。我想跟以前的老朋友們問候聊聊。」
就這樣，我並沒有再打過電話給她。大約3個月後，我看到曾任《寫真時代》總編輯的末井昭所寫的編輯後記，才知道她已經自殺，同時也了解到她最後那些話是什麼意思。
那段時間，我和妻子住在初台。我那時擔任《野性時代》這本小說雜誌的編輯，大部分的工作是負責發掘新銳作家。
由於五木寬之先生對她的小說讚賞有加，在他的推薦下，我便和鈴木泉美約了第一次見面。在Cof fee Road Shimizu的二樓，她那鞋跟細到不行的高跟鞋，一頭像是褪色的紅褐色頭髮，還有門牙全都掉光的嘴型，令人印象非常深刻。後來，我又跟她見過好幾次面，但是就我所知，她那些被丈夫阿部薰揮拳打落的門牙，從來就沒有去補過。而我和她見面的那次，即是第一次也是最後一次的單獨見面。
就連破曉前約在校對室碰面，阿部薰也會和鈴木泉美一起來。約在中野的咖啡廳更不在話下，阿部薰必定跟在鈴木泉美的身邊。阿部薰死後，我和鈴木泉美通電話的次數不可勝數，但卻從來沒有再相約見面過。
她和阿部薰一起生活的時候，也常常打電話給我。其中有幾次是討論關於校樣的修改，或下一部小說的構想，但絕大多數都是她在抱怨和阿部薰之間的爭執。她經常喋喋不休地向我告狀，說一些像是阿部薰砍斷她的腳趾、阿部薰會殺了她、阿部薰打得她眼睛張不開之類的事。不過她在電話裡的口氣，完全不像一般人吐苦水時那樣地憤慨激昂，反而像是在某個地方剛被叫醒的感覺。
有時鈴木泉美甚至會在他也在的場合裡，淡淡地說：「這個人非常差勁呢。」
而阿部薰就在旁默默地喝茶。
我那時還滿喜歡這個話不多、臉色發青、身材短小的男子。鈴木泉美說起話來總是不帶情緒，沒有高低起伏，但卻絮絮叨叨、沒完沒了；相較之下，阿部薰雖然只會低著頭嘀嘀咕咕，但是說也奇怪，這個演奏前衛爵士樂的樂手，偶爾自言自語似的每句話，卻總能刺進我的心裡。
鈴木泉美替《野性時代》撰寫的小說，我幾乎都已不復記憶了。雖然我應該請她改過很多次原稿或校樣，但不論是故事內容或只是文章裡的隻言片語，我完全毫無印象，真是不可思議。與她小說裡那些悽慘的情節恰巧相反，我覺得她的小說猶如剪影一樣，沒能讓人留下深刻的印象。
或許對鈴木泉美而言，任何事情，包括其撰寫的小說，是否引起熱烈的迴響都無所謂。對已經冷眼看盡世事滄涼的她來說，唯獨阿部薰是她心中永遠無法割捨的痛楚。但矛盾的是，她又熱切地希望能與阿部薰同甘共苦，這個想法成了她存活下去的支柱。
鈴木泉美一天到晚，口口聲聲地說「我想和他分手」，結果卻是無論何時何地，她和阿部薰總是同進同出。阿部薰徹頭徹尾就和這個世界格格不入，讓人每次想到他受傷的靈魂時，都難免不寒而慄，感覺很負面。其實，她對世間萬物都早已麻木，但在內心深處卻又忌妒阿部薰可以感受到如此強烈的痛苦，因此而無法自拔，非得陪在他身邊不可。
她總是藉由戕害自己的身體，去試圖證明著些什麼。對她而言，似乎只有這麼做，才能追上被痛苦折磨的阿部薰。
這個早熟的少女，或許早在遇見阿部薰之前，就已經死過一次了。
換句話說，這個過分規矩地愛著這個世界的少女，就生活在與世界激烈碰撞，然後被拒絕、被拋棄，如行屍走肉般的日子之中。
我不知道他們兩個是在什麼時候、什麼情況下認識的，只是阿部薰的出現，就像是有人強烈要求鈴木泉美，試著再活一次一樣。
她之所以繼續度過餘生，就是為了讓阿部薰的痛苦，變成她的痛苦。
位在初台的甲州街道旁某髒汙的大樓裡「GAYA」爵士酒吧，是我和妻子無聊時經常去打發時間的店。先不說我自己，我的妻子倒是很懂爵士樂。這裡美其名是現場爵士演奏酒吧，其實店內連椅子都用紙箱代替，可說是簡陋得要命。通常我和妻子會點兩杯兌水的Suntory White，然後坐下來和老闆娘聊天，一邊聆賞著不知名爵士樂手的現場表演。
這家酒吧連表演的舞台都沒有，而我是在認識鈴木泉美和阿部薰之後又隔了很久，才從老闆娘那裡聽說阿部薰在這家店演奏。我拜託他可否現場演奏，只見他表情靦腆地說：「這得看我有沒有演奏的興致。」我又問什麼他什麼時候才願意獻藝？因為我實在很擔心他會窮得連生活費都沒有。
不過，有天我的住處突然收到兩張標題為《慢慢地死去》的套裝黑膠唱片，這表示阿部薰當時的確是名專業的爵士樂手。
某天夜裡，我與阿部薰在路上不期而遇。
「好不容易要振作起來，薩克斯風卻送進了當鋪，真是沒辦法呀。」他一派輕鬆地說，說完便消失在熙來攘往的街頭。而鈴木泉美則是曾經打電話告訴我：「他嗑藥嗑過頭，今天晚上又放人家鴿子沒有登台現場表演。」所以當聽老闆娘說阿部薰有在「GAYA」演奏時，我也姑且相信了這個說法。
後來我終於在「GAYA」聽到那個如幻影般的爵士演奏。當天，只有我和妻子以及鈴木泉美，僅僅的3個客人。
阿部薰演奏時，鈴木泉美閉著眼睛聆聽那沉重昏暗的樂音。偶爾她會將兌水的Suntory White一飲而盡，再點一杯，然後又閉上眼睛。
我心想，那時候鈴木泉美的腦海裡，究竟在想些什麼呢？她是沉浸在確實經歷過而逐漸遠去的時光中？抑或是朝著即使自己再怎麼粉身碎骨也追不上阿部薰內心深處的黑洞奔駛而去呢？
在阿部薰的整場表演過程中，他幾乎都是蹲著演奏。他拒絕旋律，只是從自己的身體裡榨出一個又一個的單音，彷彿要將每個樂音還給被旋律奪走的音符。阿部薰的中低音，為了破壞與重生而不顧一切，充滿悲壯的情緒，與其說是過於激進，毋寧說是接近樂音的極致。
我當時就很清楚，這男子來日不多了。但是這種事實在是荒唐得無法說出口，就算任何聽過阿部薰演奏中低音爵士樂的人，都會和我有同樣的感覺。而且這種事情鈴木泉美應該最清楚。
幾個月後，阿部薰服藥過量，宛如早已安排好似地走向人生的盡頭。
後來，在GAYA舉行的追悼音樂會、告別式，以及朋友的聚會……等，我全都沒有參加。
「無論是嗑藥或是演奏，我從來不曾爽到極點。」「我想成為中低音爵士樂手。」
我想起在我們兩個人獨處的時候，阿部薰嘟嚷的那些話語。
在阿部薰死後，鈴木泉美仍像以前那樣經常打電話給我，用平淡的口氣，叨叨絮絮地訴說著她和阿部薰生下的孩子，以及未來如何生活……等。不過有時候，鈴木泉美也會很難得地語帶嬌吟地對我說：「我好寂寞啊。」
至此，我覺得鈴木泉美幾乎已經沒有繼續活下去的理由。
「如果可以的話，」我對她說：「花幾年的時間都無所謂，我希望你將你和阿部薰從初次見面到分手的過程，寫成一部長篇小說。」
鈴木泉美寫完這部小說，應該就會離開人世。
雖然我有預感鈴木泉美沒有辦法再寫小說，但我覺得當時的氣氛，如果不說那些話，彼此都會無法承受。「是啊，得把這小說寫出來呀。」鈴木泉美喃喃自語似地回答道。
從那之後又過了好幾年，我在公司裡已經換了3個部門，當上《角川月刊》的總編輯，除了那年冬末接到鈴木泉美的電話之外，我對她的事情已經沒什麼印象。
阿部薰死後，鈴木泉美靠著政府的低收入戶津貼，照顧她和阿部薰所生的小孩。就在打完那通電話的數星期後，她竟然在孩子面前上吊自殺，享年36歲。
有關鈴木泉美和阿部薰，除了上述所寫的事情外，我已經無法明確地想起任何事情。
只記得鈴木泉美在電話中的那句話。
那是在阿部薰過世的那年冬天，我剛和妻子離婚分手，打電話通知鈴木泉美這件事的時候，她在電話那端稍做停頓後所說的：「人一旦上了年紀，都會變得很孤單呢。」

""Editing the disease"": Her front teeth that were beaten down by her husband have never been replenished.
05 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is ""Please be sure to call me back. I want to talk to my old friends."" In this way, I didn't call her again. About three months later, I saw the editorial postscript written by Soru Sho, the former editor-in-chief of ""The Photo Age"", only to know that she had committed suicide.



Text: See the city
Suzuki Izumi - Last Greetings
I vaguely remember that it was late at night in the late winter. I talked to my female friend about the phone and the voice was plugged in.
""I am Suzuki Izumi. Is it Mr. City?""
This sound has no ups and downs, and people recognize who they are.
When I was, I suddenly felt trouble coming to my door. First, my girlfriend and I were talking about the Xingtou. Secondly, the telephone attack of Suzuki Izumi a few years ago made me want to escape. I told Suzuki Izumi that I was talking on the phone and she came in. Then, because I had deleted her phone number from the notebook, I asked her for the phone number again and said that she would call back to her later and hang up.
I still remember what she said at the time. She said so:
""Please be sure to call me back. I want to talk to my old friends.""
In this way, I did not call her again. About three months later, I saw the editorial postscript written by Toshii Sho, the former editor of the ""Photos of the Times"", to know that she had committed suicide and also learned what her last words meant.
During that time, my wife and I lived in the beginning. I was the editor of the novel magazine Wild Age, and most of my work was to discover new writers.
Since Mr. Wu Mu Kuanzhi appreciated her novels, under his recommendation, I met with Suzuki Izumi for the first time. On the second floor of Cof fee Road Shimizu, her heels are not so high-heeled, the head is faded reddish-brown hair, and the mouth of the incisors are all light-skinned. It is very impressive. Later, I met her several times, but as far as I know, her front teeth, which were shot down by her husband Abe Kasumi, never made up. The one I met with her was the first and last time to meet alone.
Even before the dawn of the meeting, I met in the proof room, and Abe Kaoru will come with Suzuki Izumi. About in the cafe in Nakano, Abe Kasumi must be with Suzuki Izumi. After Abe Kaoru’s death, the number of calls I made with Suzuki Izumi was innumerable, but I never met again.
When she lives with Abe Kaoru, she often calls me. Several of these were discussions about the revision of the proof, or the idea of the next novel, but the vast majority were her disputes between complaining and Abe. She often whispered to me, saying that some of them were like Abe Kaoru cutting her toes, Abe Kaoru would kill her, and Abe Kaoru couldn't open her eyes. However, her tone on the phone is not as indulgent as the average person spits water, but rather feels like she has just been woken up somewhere.
Sometimes Suzuki Izumi even said in a circumstance where he was also: ""This person is very bad.""
And Abe Kaoru is drinking tea in silence.
I was still full of people who didn't have much words, blue face and short stature. Suzuki Izumi’s words always have no emotions, no ups and downs, but they are lingering and endless. In contrast, Abe Kaoru will only bow his head, but it’s strange to say that this is avant-garde. The jazz musicians, occasionally talking to each other, can always penetrate into my heart.
I almost never remembered the novels written by Suzuki Izumi for ""The Wild Age."" Although I should ask her to change the manuscript or proof many times, it is incredible that I am completely unimpressed, whether it is the content of the story or just the words in the article. Contrary to the miserable plots in her novels, I think her novels are like silhouettes, which are not impressive.
Perhaps for Suzuki Izumi, it doesn't matter whether anything, including the novels it writes, causes a warm response. For her who has been cold-eyed and obsessed with the world, only Abe Kaoru is the pain that she can never give up in her heart. But the paradox is that she is eager to share the same pains with Abe Kaoru. This idea has become the pillar of her survival.
Suzuki Izumi was beautiful all day long, and she said, ""I want to break up with him."" The result is that she and Abe Kaoru always go in and out together whenever and wherever. Abe Kasumi is completely out of touch with the world, and every time he thinks about his injured soul, he will inevitably shudder and feel very negative. In fact, she has long been numb to everything in the world, but in the depths of her heart, she is also afraid of Abe Kaoru can feel such a strong pain, and therefore unable to extricate herself, must be with him.
She always tries to prove something by hurting her body. For her, it seems that only this can be done to catch up with the suffering of Abe Kaoru.
This precocious girl may have died once before she met Abe Kaoru.
In other words, this girl who loves the world too much is living in a fierce collision with the world, then being rejected and abandoned, such as walking dead.
I don't know when and when they met each other. It was just the appearance of Abe Kaoru. It was like someone who strongly urged Suzuki Izumi to try to live again.
The reason why she continued to spend the rest of her life was to make the pain of Abe Kaoru become her pain.
The ""GAYA"" Jazz Bar in a dirty building next to the Kaizhou street in the early days is a shop where I often go to spend time when I am bored with my wife. Not to mention myself, my wife knows jazz very well. The name here is the live jazz performance bar. In fact, even the chairs in the store are replaced by cardboard boxes, which can be said to be simple. Usually my wife and I will order two cups of Suntory White, then sit down and chat with the boss, while listening to live performances by unknown jazz musicians.
This bar didn't even have a stage for performances. I was separated from Suzuki Izumi and Abe Kaoru for a long time before I heard from the boss that Abe Kaoru played in this store. I asked him if he could play live. I saw his expression and said, ""It depends on whether I have the interest in playing."" I asked him when he was willing to perform. Because I am really worried that he will be poor and have no living expenses.
However, one day my residence suddenly received two sets of vinyl records titled ""Slowly Die"", which means that Abu Xun was indeed a professional jazz musician at the time.
One night, I met Abe Kaoru on the road.
""It’s hard to get up, but Sax is sent to the pawn shop. It’s really no way.” He said easily, and then disappeared into the bustling streets. Suzuki Izumi used to call and told me: ""He has overdone the drug, and he has not released the pigeons on the stage this evening."" So when listening to the boss saying that Abe Kaoru was playing in ""GAYA"", I also believed. This statement.
Later, I finally heard the jazz performance like ""Phantom"" in ""GAYA"". On that day, only me and my wife and Suzuki Izumi, only 3 guests.
When Abe Kaoru played, Suzuki Izumi listened to the heavy and dim music with her eyes closed. Occasionally she will drink the water-filled Suntory White, order another cup, and then close her eyes.
I thought to myself, what was thinking about Suzuki Izumi’s mind at that time? Is she immersed in the time she has actually experienced and gradually gone away? Or is it going to go to the black hole deep inside Abe Kaoru even if you can't get rid of it?
In the whole performance of Abe Kaoru, he almost played around. He refused the melody, but squeezed one tone after another from his body, as if to return each tone to the notes that were taken away by the melody. Abe Kaoru's mid-bass, desperate for destruction and rebirth, full of tragic emotions, is not too radical, rather than the extreme of music.
I knew very well at the time that this man was not much coming. But this fact is ridiculous and cannot be said. Even anyone who has heard the bass jazz in Abe Kaoru will feel the same way. And this kind of thing Suzuki Izumi should be the clearest.
A few months later, Abe Kaoru took too much medicine, as if he had already arranged to go to the end of his life.
Later, I did not participate in the memorial concerts, farewells, and friends' gatherings held in GAYA.
""I have never been to the extreme, whether it is taking drugs or playing."" ""I want to be a bass jazz player.""
I think of the words of Abe Kaoru when we were alone.
After Abe Kaoru’s death, Suzuki Izumi still called me as often as I used to, with a plain tone, telling the story of her and Abe’s children, and how to live in the future...etc. But sometimes, Suzuki Izumi will also be very difficult to say to me with a poem: ""I am so lonely.""
At this point, I feel that Suzuki Izumi has almost no reason to continue living.
""If you can,"" I said to her, ""It doesn't matter whether it takes a few years. I hope that you will write a novel from the first meeting and the breakup of Abe Kaoru.""
When Suzuki Iumi wrote this novel, it should leave the world.
Although I have a hunch that Suzuki Izumi can't write a novel anymore, I feel that the atmosphere at that time, if you don't say those words, will not be able to bear each other. ""Yeah, you have to write this novel out."" Suzuki Izumi whispered to himself.
After several years, I have changed three departments in the company. I became the editor-in-chief of ""Kadokawa Monthly"". In addition to the call from Suzuki Izumi at the end of the winter, I have already done things for her. No impression.
After Abe Kaoru’s death, Suzuki Izumi relied on the government’s low-income household allowance to take care of her and the children born by Abe Kaoru. Just a few weeks after the phone call, she actually hanged herself in front of her child at the age of 36.
Regarding Suzuki Izumi and Abe Kaoru, I can't clearly think of anything except the things I wrote above.
I only remember the words of Suzuki Izumi on the phone.
That was the winter when Abe Kaoru passed away. When I just broke up with my wife and called to inform Suzuki Izumi about this, she said after a pause at the end of the phone: ""When people get older, they will Become very lonely.""
