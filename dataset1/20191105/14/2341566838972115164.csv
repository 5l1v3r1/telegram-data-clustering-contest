不只日本微軟 全球企業紛紛試辦做4休3

（中央社華盛頓4日綜合外電報導）日本微軟今年稍早實驗讓員工一週工作4天，業務部門近日在網站說，在這個加班文化盛行的國家，縮短工時生產力不減反增，全球各地如今也有愈來愈多企業嘗試讓員工週休3日。
「華盛頓郵報」報導，日本微軟8月將連續5個星期五併入例假，讓員工從週休2日變成週休3日。根據網站貼文，相較於去年同期，這段期間生產力激增40%，辦公室影印紙張減少59%，用電節省23%，員工對這項實驗的滿意度更高達94%。
這項為期一個多月的實驗，被視為是「工作生活選擇」策略的一環，目的在於幫助員工較彈性工作。與此同時，日本各地的勞動制度改革雷厲風行，日本首相安倍晉三推行的勞改政策包括嚴格規定加班時數上限，以及提高兼職和臨時工工資。
日本微軟（Microsoft Japan）的「工作生活選擇挑戰2019夏季計畫」（Work Life Choice Challenge 2019 Summer project）8月提供員工特殊有薪假，每週五不上班，以宣導員工在較短工時更有效率地工作，鼓勵員工「短時間工作後休息，並取得良好學習成效」，以改善生產力和創造力。
根據日本微軟網站所言，公司今年冬天將再次實驗縮短工時，但這次不會提供特殊有薪假，而是鼓勵員工較彈性地獨立工作、縮短開會時間，善用合作工具和聰明支配有薪假和年末假期。
然而，在勞動力市場形勢依然嚴峻的狀態下，技術提供了更大的靈活性，顯示工作4天後休息3天帶來良好成果的報告也如雨後春筍般激增，全球如今有愈來愈多企業嘗試讓員工一週工作4天，而微軟在日本的實驗則是最新一例。
美國漢堡連鎖店Shake Shack說，他們也在嘗試這類計畫；在英國，北愛爾蘭和英格蘭若干最大工會，也支持讓員工一週工作4天，英國主要反對黨工黨（Labour Party）也針對這類構想委託進行研究。
紐西蘭信託與投資顧問公司Perpetual Guardian也展開了長達8週的類似實驗；這家公司的員工一週工作30小時，但可領到37.5小時的工資。Perpetual Guardian說，在報告顯示工作績效持平且員工壓力和敬業度皆得到改善後，週休3日將成為可選擇的永久性制度。
一些嘗試過類似構想的較小型公司也大讚其帶來的益處，包括工作與生活更加平衡和員工生產力增加，但他們也說，縮減工時可能導致員工上班時壓力更大。
若干觀察人士警告，這類舉措恐使員工薪資減少、損害競爭力，因此更理想的方式是「溫和推動」減少工時而非訂出上限。
華郵7月報導，對美國勞工運動而言，這個點子目前沒有太多吸引力。舉例來說，2020年民主黨總統參選人紛紛支持其他雄心勃勃的構想，例如全民基本收入或聯邦工作保障，但沒有一人提出一週工作4天的政見。（譯者：劉文瑜/核稿：張曉雯）1081105

Not only Japan's Microsoft, global companies have tried to do 4 rest 3
05 Nov 2019, 14:58 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Washington, DC, 4th), Japan’s Microsoft experiment this year, let employees work four days a week. The business department recently said on the website that in this country where overtime culture is prevalent, the productivity of working hours is shortened, and the world is now more and more More and more companies are trying to get employees to rest for 3 days.
The ""Washington Post"" reported that Japan's Microsoft will be incorporated into the official holiday for five consecutive Fridays in August, allowing employees to change from 2 days on weekdays to 3 days on weekdays. According to the website postings, compared with the same period of last year, productivity increased by 40% during the period, office photocopying paper decreased by 59%, electricity consumption saved 23%, and employees' satisfaction with this experiment was as high as 94%.
This one-month experiment is seen as part of the ""work life choice"" strategy to help employees work more flexibly. At the same time, labor system reforms across Japan have become more vigorous, and the labor reform policy pursued by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has imposed strict restrictions on overtime hours and increased part-time and temporary wages.
Microsoft Japan's ""Work Life Choice Challenge 2019 Summer project"" provides employees with special paid leave in August, and does not go to work every Friday to promote employees in shorter working hours. Work efficiently and encourage employees to ""break after a short period of work and achieve good learning outcomes"" to improve productivity and creativity.
According to the Japanese Microsoft website, the company will try to shorten the working hours again this winter, but this time it will not provide special paid leave, but encourage employees to work more flexibly, shorten the meeting time, make good use of cooperation tools and smartly control the paid time. Fake and year-end holidays.
However, in a state where the labor market is still in a tough situation, technology provides greater flexibility. Reports that show good results after three days of work and four days have mushroomed, and more and more companies are trying globally. Let employees work 4 days a week, and Microsoft's experiment in Japan is the latest example.
The US burger chain Shake Shack said they are also experimenting with such plans; in the UK, some of the largest unions in Northern Ireland and England also support employees for four days a week, and the UK's main opposition Labour Party has also commissioned such ideas. research.
New Zealand's trust and investment consultancy Perpetual Guardian also launched a similar eight-week experiment; the company's employees work 30 hours a week, but can receive 37.5 hours of salary. Perpetual Guardian said that after the report shows that job performance is flat and employee pressure and engagement are improved, the 3rd week of the week will become an optional permanent system.
Some smaller companies that have tried similar ideas have also praised the benefits, including a more balanced work and life and increased employee productivity, but they also said that reducing work hours may lead to greater pressure on employees to go to work.
A number of observers have warned that such initiatives may reduce employee salaries and damage competitiveness. Therefore, the more desirable way is to ""moderately promote"" to reduce working hours rather than set a ceiling.
Hua Post reported in July that this idea is not very attractive to the American labor movement. For example, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have supported other ambitious ideas, such as basic national income or federal job security, but no one has proposed political views for four days a week.
