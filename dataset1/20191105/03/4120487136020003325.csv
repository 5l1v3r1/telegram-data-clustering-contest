匈牙利央行总裁称欧元是“战略性错误”

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

【路透布达佩斯讯】匈牙利央行总裁Gyorgy Matolcsy在金融时报刊出的观点文章中表示，欧元区内外的欧盟成员国均应承认欧元是“战略性错误”。Matolcsy表示，现在是欧洲“寻找出路摆脱欧元陷阱”的时候了。“欧元是统一西欧的“正常”下一步，这样的看法是有害的。欧元一点也不正常，因为几乎所有的先决条件都没有达到，”他在周日刊出的观点文章中表示。“欧元上路20年来，一种成功的全球性货币所需要的大多数支柱仍然都欠缺，这些支柱包括：一个共同的政府、能覆盖至少15-20%欧元区总区内生产总值的预算、一位欧元区财政部长，以及欧元区财政部，”他表示。Matolcsy表示，在未来几十年里，应该允许成员国离开欧元区，而留下来的成员国，应该建立起一个“更持久的全球性货币”。

The Hungarian central bank president said the euro is a ""strategic mistake""

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

[Reuters Budapest] Gyorgy Matolcsy, president of the Hungarian Central Bank, said in a financial article published that the EU member states within and outside the euro should recognize the euro as a ""strategic mistake."" Matolcsy said that it is time for Europe to ""find a way out of the euro trap."" “The euro is the “normal” next step in the unification of Western Europe. This view is harmful. The euro is not normal at all, because almost all the prerequisites have not been met,” he said in a commentary published on Sunday. “For the past 20 years, the euro has been lacking most of the pillars needed for a successful global currency. These pillars include: a common government, a budget that covers at least 15-20% of the total GDP of the euro zone, A eurozone finance minister and the eurozone finance ministry,"" he said. Matolcsy said that in the next few decades, member states should be allowed to leave the euro zone, and the remaining member states should establish a ""more sustainable global currency.""
