      <p>Panic’s version of the song – sung in the movie by Elsa – features guitar riffs and rousing backing vocals, not to mention powerful singing by frontman Brendon Urie.</p>
      <p>“<i>Everyone I’ve ever loved is here within these walls / I’m sorry secret siren, but I’m blocking out your calls / I’ve had my adventure / I don’t need something new / I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you / Into the unknown</i>,” Urie belts.</p>
