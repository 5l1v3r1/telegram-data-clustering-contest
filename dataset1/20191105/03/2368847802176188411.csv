四中全會鬧出人命 五人缺席兩人離奇死

05 Nov 2019, 03:34

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】剛結束不久的中共十九屆四中全會公報中，沒有顯示人事異動。但媒體發現，全會期間鬧出了人命，在缺席四中全會的5人中，有兩人離奇死亡，其中包括中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒。
四中全會前就有外媒放風，有地方大員要晉升政治局常委，及習近平接班人將亮相。但全會公報沒有顯示人事異動，只是按規矩遞補中央候補委員馬正武、馬偉明為中央委員，並審議通過對去年5月已「主動投案」，早前被降級處理的前證監會主席劉士余的審查報告。
現任中國融通總經理的馬正武，和現任海軍工程大學電氣工程學院電力電子技術研究所主任馬偉明，所填補的空缺是劉士余，以及前澳門中聯辦主任鄭曉松。
據中共官方通報，出席本次會議的有「中央委員202人，候補中央委員169人」等。而2017年10月產生的中共十九屆中央委員、中央候補委員分別有204人、172人。
這意味着有2名中央委員、3名候補委員缺席了四中全會。

缺席全會的2名中央委員

2名中央委員分別是劉士余和鄭曉松。
四中全會確認了對中華全國供銷合作總社前主任劉士余，作出的「留黨察看二年的處分」。
劉士余曾任中共證監會主席，今年5月「主動投案」。10月4日，劉士余被立案審查調查，降為一級調研員。他是首名被調查的中共十九屆中央委員。
中共官方在對劉士余的通報中，提到一條比較罕見罪名，指其「公開發表不當言論，缺乏政治警覺和保密意識」。
劉士余曾在中共十九大的分組討論時狠批「大老虎」周永康、薄熙來等人位高權重，既巨貪又巨腐，又「陰謀篡黨奪權」等，媒體認為這是他被查的原因之一。
另一名中央委員鄭曉松，於去年10月20日在澳門中聯辦離奇墜樓身亡。
中共稱其患上「抑鬱症」。當時曾引發外界不少猜測。近年中共反腐肅殺，「抑鬱症」在中共官員中頗為流行，幾乎所有「自殺」的官員都被當局冠予「抑鬱症」。
但流亡澳洲的中國法學教授袁紅冰披露，鄭曉松「被跳樓」，是因涉及已經落馬的中共公安部副部長孟宏偉案。
孟宏偉是前政法委書記周永康的馬仔，手中握有至少5項中共的重要機密，包括孟宏偉曾參與謀殺十世班禪大師；孟宏偉參與了製造台灣3.19槍擊案；孟宏偉掌握大量中共官員海外資產的通道和分布情況，及孟宏偉編撰《當代百官行述》等。孟宏偉是鄭曉松的上線。

缺席全會的3名候補委員

3名中央候補委員，分别是重慶市委副書記任學鋒，中國建築集團公司董事長官慶和中國移動技術部總經理王曉雲。
1964年出生的官慶疑似出事，他在大型央企中建集團任職總經理、董事長近10年。
中建集團有限公司9月2日發布主要領導調整公告，任命周乃翔任公司董事長、黨組書記。官慶被免去該公司董事長、黨組書記職務。但公告沒說明官慶被免原因。
10月10日，中建集團上市企業中建股份有限公司發布公告稱，官慶向公司董事會遞交辭呈，申請辭去公司董事長、董事以及戰略委員會主任委員職務。
王曉雲缺席全會的原因暫時不明。
任學鋒在中共四中全會期間離奇去世。重慶官媒11月3日晚通報，任學鋒「因病去世」，時年54歲。
但外媒披露，任學鋒是在四中全會召開的地點京西賓館從七樓跳下身亡。
京西賓館歷來是中共會議重地，實行軍事化管理，由中共軍隊直接控制。10月30日，四中全會召開期間，就有消息稱，在京西賓館閉門舉行全會期間，所有與會人員都被嚴密監控很難聯絡。

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] In the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee that was just concluded, there was no change in personnel.

Before the Fourth Plenary Session, foreign media will release the wind. Some local officials will be promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee, and Xi Jinping’s successor will be unveiled. However, the plenary bulletin did not show any personnel changes, but only the central alternate members of the Central Committee, Ma Zhengwu and Ma Weiming, as members of the Central Committee, and reviewed and approved the review report of Liu Shiyu, former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, who had been ""proactively surrendered"" in May last year. .

At the group discussion of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Liu Shiyu criticized the ""big tiger"" Zhou Yongkang and Bo Xilai and other people with high powers, both greed and greed, and ""intrigues and robbing the party to seize power"". The media believes that this is his being One of the reasons for the investigation.

""Depression"" has become popular among CCP officials. Almost all ""suicide"" officials have been awarded ""depression"" by the authorities.
However, Yuan Hongbing, a Chinese law professor in exile in Australia, disclosed that Zheng Xiaosong’s “being jumped from the building” was due to the case involving Meng Hongwei, the deputy minister of the Chinese Communist Party’s public security department.
Meng Hongwei, former secretary of the Political and Legal Committee Zhou Yongkang, holds at least five important secrets of the CCP, including Meng Hongwei who participated in the murder of the 10th Panchen Lama; Meng Hongwei participated in the shooting of Taiwan 3.19; Meng Hongwei has a large number of CCP officials.
