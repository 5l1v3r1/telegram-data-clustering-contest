      <h1>Matthew McConaughey Joins Instagram In A Very Matthew McConaughey Way</h1>
      <h2>The actor rang in his 50th birthday on Monday by announcing his new social media page through videos, songs, and, naturally, some inspiration.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T03:54:45+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 03:54</time> by <a rel="author">Jenna Amatulli, HuffPost US</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/matthew-mcconaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> is celebrating his 50th birthday with an announcement: He’s officially on Instagram.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the actor posted a series of videos on both Twitter and the ’gram to ring in his new handle, which is, aptly, @officiallymcconaughey.</p>
      <p>“Born November the 4th 1969, got my dad’s name the very same day. But not until I turned 50, today, did I become @officiallymcconaughey. That’s my Instagram handle. See you there,” says the Texas native in a video he tweeted.</p>

      <p>“The Beach Bum” star got candid in his first post on his newly minted page, telling fans in a confessional sort of video: “When people come to my page, I want them to see me. Look, this is my first venture into sharing myself and my views with the world, and I’m a little bit nervous about it, because quite frankly, I know I want to have a monologue. I’m not sure I want to have the dialogue. But I’ve learned that you gotta have the dialogue, too.”</p>
      <p>McConaughey waxed poetic a bit, as he’s wont to do ― have you seen those Lincoln ads? ― adding that he also wants to “have some fun” with the platform and hopes his content “makes you think a second” or even “makes your heart swell up a little bit.”</p>

      <p>To cover all of his bases, the father of three also sang a little song on his Instagram Story. </p>
      <p>“Do I have an Instagram? Well, I’d be a lot cooler if I did. But guess what? It is now a lot cooler because I do,” he says after singing in a velvet chair, as one does.</p>

      <p>Oh, boy. We can’t wait to see what sort of antics he gets up to on this platform.</p>
