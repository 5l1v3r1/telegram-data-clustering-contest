      <p>Siemens has appointed Thai Lai Pham as the new CEO of Siemens ASEAN and Singapore, succeeding Armin Bruck as he retires from the company after 32 years.<br/><br/>Concurrent with his new role, Pham will remain as the country CEO of Siemens Vietnam, a position he has held since 2012 where he has been responsible for projects such as helping private automotive startup VinFast to build Southeast Asia's first fully digital factory. <br/><br/>Prior to heading up the German company's operations in Vietnam, Pham worked in various roles across the company, including Siemens' healthcare, energy, and now-defunct mobile phones divisions, in addition to helping the company build technologies in the US, Europe, and Asia. <br/><br/>According to the company, as Siemens ASEAN's new CEO, Pham will focus on driving the company's digital industries, smart infrastructure, and mobility businesses in the region. <br/><br/><b>See also: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-siemens-put-10-billion-into-digital-transformation/">Why Siemens put $10 billion into digital transformation</a> (TechRepublic)</b></p>
