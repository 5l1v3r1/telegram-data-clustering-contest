      <h1>Shelby American GT500 Dragon Snake Powers Into SEMA With 800+ HP</h1>
      <h2>The extra punch is complemented by a meaner body kit.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T03:18:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 03:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>It was only last week when Shelby American <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379469/shelby-american-2020-ford-mustang-gt500/">announced plans</a> to upgrade the new GT500 and now we already have the first package tailored to the ultimate Mustang. Officially labeled as a concept car, the Dragon Snake premieres today at <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/sema-show/">SEMA</a> with a slightly more aggressive body kit and newly designed one-piece forged aluminum wheels wrapped in performance tires.</p>
      <p>From the carbon fiber hood and rear spoiler made from the same material and derived from drag cars, you can immediately tell this isn’t a standard <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/shelby-gt500/">GT500</a>. Shelby American is already considering a widebody kit for those who still feel the Mustang doesn’t look mean enough. Rounding off the visual changes are the individually numbered dash plaque and engine plate.</p>

      <p>There’s more to the Dragon Snake than these cosmetic upgrades as the changes are skin deep. For example, the 5.2-liter V8 engine has been taken from the series 760 horsepower to more than 800 hp thanks to an upgraded supercharger. While <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/shelby-american/">Shelby American</a> doesn’t say anything about torque, we imagine it has also gone up from the stock 625 pound-feet (847 Newton-meters). The GT500 already does 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) in <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379472/shelby-gt500-60-mph/">3.3 seconds</a> and the quarter mile in 10.7 seconds, so it should be an absolute rocket with even more power.</p>
      <p>The modified <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> benefits from an upgraded exhaust system as well as a Shelby American-tuned suspension with MagneRide and optimized springs and sway bars at the front and rear. All of these suspension optimizations have been done to improve the vehicle’s acceleration in a straight line, but also to maximize grip.</p>

      <p>In addition, the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission has been tweaked to cope with the extra power delivered by the V8. The list of modifications is quite extensive as it also includes high-flow catalytic converters and a glass package shaving off some weight compared to the regular <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/coupe/">coupe</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s no word about pricing, but math starts at $70,300 for a standard Shelby Mustang GT500 and rises to <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/370086/most-expensive-mustang-shelby-gt500/">six figures</a> for the fully loaded variant.</p>
