Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro with 108MP penta rear camera, Snapdragon 730G launched in China
05 Nov 2019, 03:26 by Aamir Siddiqui
Back in July this year, Xiaomi announced a new camera-centric lineup for the Chinese market. The first products in this lineup were the Xiaomi Mi CC9 and the Xiaomi Mi CC9e. While the Mi CC lineup remained restricted to China, the phones got rebranded and made their way to international markets. The Mi CC9 made its way to Europe as the Mi 9 Lite, while the Mi CC9e made its way to Europe and India as the rather underwhelming Mi A3. Now, the Chinese company is moving on to the next product in this lineup, launching the Mi CC9 Pro in China.

The Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro has been extensively teased by the company in the preceding week, so we had a good idea of what to expect.
The primary focus of the Mi CC9 Pro is obviously its camera setup, as this is the most ambitious and versatile camera setup that Xiaomi has bestowed upon any of its devices.



There are multiple notable talking points in the penta-rear camera setup, so we will start with the first one: the 108MP Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor.














The biggest advantage that the 108MP sensor brings along is the physically large 1/1.33″ sensor, which will allow the camera to absorb more light in low-light scenarios. As expected, you can either choose to adopt pixel binning to combine four pixels into one and get a 27MP shot (default) or get full resolution 108MP shots. The regular Mi CC9 Pro comes with a 7P lens setup, while the Mi CC9 Pro Premium Edition (which is just the higher storage and RAM variant) comes with an 8P lens setup. The camera also features OIS for this camera, so your shot will remain unaffected by hand movements.
The second highlight camera on the Mi CC9 Pro is the 5MP telephoto camera which features 5x optical zoom along with OIS. This camera is capable of 10x hybrid zoom and 50x digital zoom, so you can capture shots that are very far away. Digital zoom is akin to zooming in after clicking the picture, but you do get noticeable improvements through optical and hybrid zooms.



The rest of the camera setup consists of a dedicated 20MP wide angle camera, a dedicated 12MP camera for portraits, and a dedicated macro sensor. The phone also comes with quad-LED flash, which should help illuminating subjects in the dark. On the front is a 32MP selfie camera housed within the waterdrop notch.
Moving on to the design, the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro comes with a 6.43″ OLED that is curved on the edges, though the curve is not as dramatic as the waterfall display on the Mate 30 Pro or the absolutely crazy surround display on the Mi Mix Alpha.



On the inside, the Mi CC9 Pro comes with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G. While this is not Qualcomm’s current flagship SoC (Snapdragon 855 Plus), it is a powerful SoC by itself, intended for use within the upper mid-tier segments. The phone is complemented by RAM and storage options of 6GB + 128GB, 8GB + 128GB and 8GB + 256GB. Xiaomi is calling the highest variant as the Premium Edition, though other than the additional lens in the main camera, we were unable to discern other differentiating features.
The Mi CC9 Pro also comes with a chunky 5,260 mAh battery that supports fast-charging up to 30W. Xiaomi claims that this fast charging technology is quicker than 40W fast charging as it does not have the steep drop in speeds once the phone reaches higher charging percentages. Half an hour of charging gets you 58% of battery, while a full charge takes just 65 minutes. The capacity of the battery makes these figures even more impressive. The phone also manages to retain several additional features, such as NFC, IR Blaster, and even the 3.5mm headphone jack.
The Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro comes in three color variants: Black, Green, and White.











The Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro costs CNY 2,799 (~$399/₹28,000/€359) for the 6GB + 128GB variant, CNY 3,099 (~$442/₹31,000/€397) for the 8GB + 128GB variant, and CNY 3,499 (~$499/₹35,000/€448)for the 8GB + 256GB variant. Keep in mind that these are pricing for the Chinese market only; the phone will launch in Europe shortly as the Mi Note 10, and we can expect to see slightly higher pricing for the region. It is currently unknown if the phone will make its way to India — our educated guess is that it will not be coming to India.
