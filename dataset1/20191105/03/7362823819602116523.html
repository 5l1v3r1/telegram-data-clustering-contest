      <h1>Lawrence Jones talks to Trump supporters at Kentucky rally fed up with impeachment inquiry</h1>

      <p><a href="https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=fi::mc=fnidisplay::src=FNI::cmp=launch::add=launch_article">Fox Nation</a> host Lawrence Jones talked to several attendees of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> rally Monday evening in Lexington, Ky.</p>
      <p>The president was in the Bluegrass State to support Republican <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-governors-race-mitch-mcconnells-litmus-test">Gov. Matt Bevin</a>, who is up for reelection Tuesday against Democrat Andy Beshear, son of former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear.</p>
      <p>Prior to his appearance Monday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Hannity</a>," Jones asked several folks why they still support Trump three years into his presidency.</p>
      <p>"Because I have common sense," one woman remarked.</p>

      <p>Another attendee told Jones Trump continues to do "everything right for America."</p>
      <p>The Fox News contributor asked another man about the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>The man said the House Democrats are conducting a "charade" and should be anxious for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-says-fisa-report-will-shock-the-conscious-and-soul-of-the-nation-as-release-date-reportedly-draws-closer">forthcoming report</a> from Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz on the FISA process.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be damning -- they're just trying to get ahead of it," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's an absolute joke," he added of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment proceedings</a>, claiming the process could backfire on Democrats because the American people, "aren't stupid."</p>

      <p>Another man told Jones Democrats are simply trying to find some type of conviction to hang on Trump ahead of the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>"They've been looking for three years and haven't found anything," he said.</p>
      <p>Amid chants of "USA" at Monday's rally, Trump repeatedly sought to leverage his accomplishments in office, including energy independence and historically low unemployment rates, to boost Bevin.</p>
      <p>At one point, Trump reminded the audience that American special forces had just provided "the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/isis-leader-baghdadi-confirmed-dead-after-apparent-suicide-during-u-s-operation-sources">world's number-one terrorist</a> a one-way ticket to hell," in a colorful reference to the now-dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</p>
