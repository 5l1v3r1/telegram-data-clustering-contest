大陸國台辦等20個部門，4日公布《關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》（簡稱26條），聲明將提供台企台胞更多優惠，包括台胞可向大陸駐外使館尋求領事保護、參與5G網路建設等。
蔡政府立即回應指此為陸「一國兩制」的政治操作、推銷「一國兩制台灣方案」，企圖介入台灣選舉；更強調中華民國是主權國家，政府對我國國民行使領事權與大陸無涉。
請問，你認為大陸推「26條措施」，是介入台灣選舉或真有實質優惠？

The 20 departments of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the mainland, on the 4th, announced the ""Several Measures for Further Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"" (referred to as Article 26). The statement will provide Taiwanese companies with more preferential treatment, including Taiwan compatriots who can be stationed abroad. The Embassy seeks consular protection and participates in the construction of 5G networks.
The Cai government immediately responded to this as the political operation of ""one country, two systems"" and promoted the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"" in an attempt to intervene in Taiwan's elections. It also emphasized that the Republic of China is a sovereign state, and the government has no right to exercise consular power over our country.
Excuse me, do you think that the mainland has pushed ""26 measures"" to intervene in Taiwan elections or really have substantial concessions?
