英国会计师对经济前景的信心 为10年来最悲观

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

【路透伦敦讯】周一公布的调查显示，英国会计师对经济前景的信心下滑，并创下10多年前金融危机高峰以来的最快降速，原因是对英国退欧及经济成长迟滞感到担忧。“英国退欧不确定性和政局不稳导致经济低迷，呈现经济成长放缓症状，”英格兰及威尔士特许会计师协会(ICAEW)首席执行官Michael Izza表示。ICAEW称，美国与中国之间的贸易摩擦也是一个因素。此次对1000名会计师的电话调查在7月22日至10月18日进行，基本涵盖了约翰逊接替特雷莎梅出任英国首相之后、寻求与欧盟重谈一份新退欧协议的这段时期。其他企业调查也同样暗淡。英国工业联盟(CBI)上月表示，制造业者对其出口前景的看法为10年来最悲观。另外，咨询机构EY ITEM Club的预测人员将英国明年经济增速预估从1.5%下调至1.0%，即便他们假定约翰逊将能够在1月31日最后期限前推动其退欧协议获得议会批准。英国伦敦行人经过金融区写字楼。

British accountants' confidence in the economic outlook is the most pessimistic in 10 years

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

[Reuters London] The survey released on Monday showed that British accountants' confidence in the economic outlook fell, and the fastest rate of decline since the peak of the financial crisis more than 10 years ago was due to concerns about Brexit and economic growth. “The uncertainty of the Brexit and political instability led to a downturn in the economy, showing signs of a slowdown in economic growth,” said Michael Izza, CEO of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). ICAEW said that trade friction between the United States and China is also a factor. The telephone survey of 1,000 accountants took place from July 22 to October 18, basically covering the period after Johnson replaced Teresa May as the British prime minister and sought to re-speak a new Brexit agreement with the EU. . Other corporate surveys are equally bleak. The British Industry Coalition (CBI) said last month that manufacturers' views on their export prospects are the most pessimistic in 10 years. In addition, the forecaster of the advisory firm EY ITEM Club lowered the UK's economic growth forecast for next year from 1.5% to 1.0%, even though they assumed that Johnson would be able to push the Brexit agreement to parliament approval before the January 31 deadline.
