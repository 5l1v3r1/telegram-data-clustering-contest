（吉隆坡5日讯）首相敦马哈迪昨日表示，马来西亚仍与高盛（Goldman Sachs）就一马发展公司（1MDB）丑闻的赔偿金进行协商。
马哈迪指出，大马拒绝了高盛的献议，因为赔款太低，相比公开要求的75亿美元。
他没有透露高盛提出的实际金额，但上周五向《金融时报》表示，这家美国银行献议少于20亿美元。
马新社报道，他昨日在曼谷出席东盟峰会时，向大马媒体说：“他们导致我们损失了约70亿美元。他们可能不会赔我们这么多。他们的（赔偿）献议太低，因此我们不接受。”
马哈迪指出，如果无法达成共识，则将对簿公堂。
“至于我们愿意接受多少，当然这需要协商，庭外协商。但是如果无法达成协议，我们就诉诸法庭。”
他接受《金融时报》专访时称：“我们对这一数额不满意，因此仍（与高盛）洽谈……如果他们作出合理的回应，我们可能不会坚持要求75亿美元。”
2012和2013年，高盛为1MDB发行了65亿美元的债券，据称从中赚取了6亿美元的手续费。
根据2007年资本市场与服务法令，大马对高盛及其子公司的17名现任和前董事提出控诉，称他们在债券发行上误导投资者。
美国当局表示，1MDB被挪用了约45亿美元。

KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Bernama) -- Prime Minister Tun Mahathir said yesterday that Malaysia is still negotiating with Goldman Sachs for compensation for the 1MDB scandal.
Mahathir pointed out that Malaysia refused Goldman’s offer because the compensation was too low compared to the $7.5 billion publicly requested.
He did not disclose the actual amount proposed by Goldman Sachs, but told the Financial Times last Friday that the US bank offered less than $2 billion.
Ma Xinshe reported that when he attended the ASEAN summit in Bangkok yesterday, he said to the Malaysian media: ""They caused us to lose about 7 billion US dollars. They may not lose us so much. Their (compensation) offer is too low, So we don't accept it.""
Mahathir pointed out that if there is no consensus, the book will be in court.
""As for how much we are willing to accept, of course, this requires consultation and consultation outside the court. But if we can't reach an agreement, we will go to court.""
In an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, he said: ""We are not satisfied with this amount, so we are still negotiating with Goldman Sachs... If they respond reasonably, we may not insist on asking for $7.5 billion.""
In 2012 and 2013, Goldman Sachs issued $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB, allegedly earning $600 million in fees.
Under the Capital Markets and Services Act of 2007, Malaysia filed a complaint against 17 current and former directors of Goldman Sachs and its subsidiaries, alleging that they misled investors on bond issuance.
The US authorities said that 1MDB was misappropriated by about $4.5 billion.
