【海外网】东盟峰会期间，菲律宾总统杜特尔特缺席合影环节，这一细节引发外界对其身体状况的猜测，随后菲总统发言人作出了回应。据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）报道，当地时间周一（4日）上午，东盟峰会领导人大合影环节，唯独缺少了菲律宾总统杜特尔特的身影，而由菲律宾外交事务秘书长维斯（Juniver Mahilum-West）代替。据了解，杜特尔特并未缺席2日举行的会议，合影环节突然缺席，这引发了外界对其身体情况的质疑。对此，菲律宾总统发言人萨尔瓦多帕内洛回应称，杜特尔特只是因为去洗手间迟到了，因此错过了合影环节。据悉，他将于今日（4日）从泰国返回菲律宾。现年74岁的杜特尔特健康状况一直备受外界关注，他上月访俄期间承认自己患有肌无力病症，一度引发舆论热议。菲官方随后回应称，杜特尔特“问题不大”，肌无力症不会对其日常工作造成影响。

05 Nov 2019, 03:58

[Overseas] During the ASEAN summit, Philippine President Duterte was absent from the photo session. This detail triggered speculation about his physical condition, and the spokesman of the Philippine President responded. According to CNN, local time on Monday morning (4th), the leader of the ASEAN summit took a photo with the Philippine President Duterte, and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Weiss ( Juniver Mahilum-West) instead. It is understood that Duterte did not miss the meeting held on the 2nd, and the group photo was suddenly absent, which caused the outside world to question its physical condition. In response, Philippine Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panello responded that Duterte missed the photo session just because he was late for the toilet. It is reported that he will return to the Philippines from Thailand today (4th). The health status of Duterte, 74, has been receiving much attention from the outside world. During his visit to Russia last month, he admitted that he had muscle weakness and caused heated public opinion. The Philippine official subsequently responded that Duterte ""has a problem"" and that myasthenia gravis does not affect his daily work.
