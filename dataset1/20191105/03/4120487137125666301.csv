还有36袋未找回!福岛核污染物搜索工作已陷入困境

05 Nov 2019, 03:58

【中新网】受台风“海贝思”引发的洪水冲击，日本福岛县大约有90袋核污染物被大雨冲走，截至1日，依旧有36袋未找回，当地搜索工作陷入困境。据报道，截至1日，找到的54袋污染物中，有29袋因垃圾袋破裂，内部污染物已经漏出。对此，据福岛县田村市一名官员表示，“大雨出乎意料，(台风之前)还没来得及为核污染物套上保护罩”。报道称，日本环境省等部门在确认核污染物被冲走后，连日来每天都有20至30人在相关区域进行搜索，甚至还出动了无人机和直升机参与搜索。但是由于当地地形复杂，搜索工作目前进展缓慢。日本环境省表示，“目前还没有确认泄露对环境产生的影响，(环境省)会与当地政府合作，继续进行搜索”。10月13日，受台风“海贝思”影响，日本福岛暴发洪水，一批装有核辐射污染物的垃圾袋被冲走，进入附近河流。垃圾袋里装的主要是从2011年福岛核事故现场清理出的草木碎片垃圾，每袋污染物的体积约为1立方米。

There are still 36 bags not retrieved! Fukushima nuclear pollutant search work has been in trouble

05 Nov 2019, 03:58

[Zhongxin.com] Due to the flooding caused by typhoon Haibeisi, about 90 bags of nuclear pollutants in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan were washed away by heavy rain. As of the 1st, 36 bags were still not retrieved, and local search work was in trouble. . According to reports, as of the 1st, 29 of the 54 bags of pollutants found were broken due to garbage bags, and internal pollutants have leaked out. In response, according to an official from Tiancun City, Fukushima Prefecture, “the heavy rain was unexpected. (Before the typhoon), I have not had time to put a protective cover on the nuclear pollutants.” According to the report, after confirming that nuclear pollutants have been washed away, the Ministry of the Environment of Japan has searched 20 to 30 people in the relevant areas every day, and even dispatched drones and helicopters to participate in the search. However, due to the complex terrain, the search work is currently progressing slowly. The Ministry of the Environment of Japan said that “the impact of the leak on the environment has not yet been confirmed, and the Ministry of the Environment will cooperate with the local government to continue the search”. On October 13th, affected by the typhoon Haibeisi, a flood in Fukushima, Japan, a group of garbage bags containing nuclear radiation pollutants were washed away and entered the nearby river. The garbage bags are mainly used to remove the debris from the site of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. The volume of each bag of pollutants is about 1 cubic meter.
