社論: 制造业现状令人担忧

05 Nov 2019, 03:57

近几个月里，有关制造业的增长数据确不令人鼓舞，如果没有适当的改善措施，或将越来越令人担忧。政府不能再藉口这种情况是全球原因造成的，为免衰退持续下去，非采取突破性步骤不可。我国今年10月的采购经理人指数（PMI）降至47.7，为2015年以来最低水平。众所周知，PMI指数低于50表示萎缩，高于50则表示扩张。上周公布的PMI指数跌幅也导致了证券交易所股票交易指数的下跌。中央统计局（BPS）数据显示，2019年第三季度制造业生产年增长率仅为4.35%，低于去年的5.04%，甚至低于2017年同期的5.06%。中央统计局负责人Suhariyanto披露，服装、饮料和加工业等多个工业部门仍录得大幅增长。然而，一些行业的产量出现下降，金属非机械制品行业下跌22.95%，橡胶行业、橡胶制品和塑料行业下跌16.63%，机械设备行业下跌12.75%。随后，烟草加工业下跌12.73%，机动车辆行业、拖车和半拖车下跌12.32%。2019年第三季度里，大中型制造业仅增长4.35%。与去年同期的5.04% 相比显然放缓了。经济放缓的原因是全球经济形势依然严峻。Suhariyanto说：“经济确实困难，全球经济疲弱，贸易战还在继续，大宗商品价格波动，这一切都影响制造业。”政府认为，这是因为我国制造业侧重于国内需求，而不太注重出口需求。制造业绩效的下降还受到一些问题的影响，例如互连性、以及仍被视为过高的劳动力和物流费用问题。 据说我国正在经历全球经济边缘化，导致国内产品不能全球化，行业很难建立市场和专业化。此外，他提到从上游到下游产业都有缺失的环节，使得各个行业不能互补共存，不得已依赖进口。无论是什么原因，政府都必须采取战略性措施来增加下游产业，使国民经济以较高的速度增长。Suhariyanto曾警告称，必须采取战略措施，因为制造业对国内生产总值（GDP）的贡献占19.5%。加工业也吸收近14%的劳动力，因此这些行业的放缓将对经济增长产生重大影响。我们非常担心制造业占国内生产总值的比重继续减少，并继续呈下降趋势。这已经成为指标之一，即我国人更喜欢做原材料，而不是有附加值的加工成品生意。如果这种趋势继续下去，那么我国将很难在国际市场上与其他国家竞争。到目前为止，我国的出口增长率也逐年放缓。最新数据显示，我国出口额同比收缩8.98%。我们需要关注这些中央统计局数据，并促请政府继续努力创造一个更有利于投资者的商业环境，从而使投资业绩不断提高，并具有高度竞争力。我们甚至需要新的突破来刺激这些投资，以便能更快地实现。与制造业快速发展的新秩序时代相比，我们目前的经济表现正在倒退。当年，政府通过精心规划的阶段和系统来建立工业部门，甚至通过让农民参与的inti-plasma系统，以便让他们的福利随着工业的发展提高。因此，政府必须能够进行有计划和可持续的工业下游化项目，创造就业机会，增加人民的收入和购买力。如果在提升制造业绩效方面没有突破，那么经济增长目标就无法实现，失业率趋于上升，民众收入水平也将趋于下降。

Editorial: Manufacturing status is worrying

05 Nov 2019, 03:57

In recent months, growth data on manufacturing has not been encouraging, and there will be more and more concern if there are no appropriate improvements. The government can no longer excuse that this situation is caused by global reasons. In order to prevent the recession from continuing, no breakthrough steps can be taken. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 47.7 in October this year, the lowest level since 2015. As we all know, a PMI index below 50 indicates a contraction, and a score above 50 indicates an expansion. The decline in the PMI index released last week also led to a decline in the stock exchange's stock trading index. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), the annual growth rate of manufacturing production in the third quarter of 2019 was only 4.35%, lower than last year's 5.04%, and even lower than 5.06% in the same period of 2017. Suhariyanto, head of the Central Bureau of Statistics, disclosed that many industrial sectors, such as clothing, beverages and processing industries, still recorded significant growth. However, production in some industries declined, the metal non-mechanical products industry fell 22.95%, the rubber industry, rubber products and plastics industry fell 16.63%, and the machinery and equipment industry fell 12.75%. Subsequently, the tobacco processing industry fell 12.73%, and the motor vehicle industry, trailers and semi-trailers fell 12.32%. In the third quarter of 2019, large and medium-sized manufacturing industries grew by only 4.35%. Compared with 5.04% in the same period last year, it obviously slowed down. The reason for the economic slowdown is that the global economic situation remains grim. Suhariyanto said: ""The economy is really difficult, the global economy is weak, the trade war is continuing, and commodity prices are fluctuating, all of which affect the manufacturing industry."" The government believes that this is because China's manufacturing industry focuses on domestic demand and does not pay much attention to exports. demand. The decline in manufacturing performance is also affected by problems such as interconnectivity and the labor and logistics costs that are still considered too high. It is said that China is experiencing the global economic marginalization, resulting in the inability of domestic products to be globalized, and it is difficult for the industry to establish markets and specialization. In addition, he mentioned that there are missing links in the upstream to downstream industries, which make it impossible for various industries to coexist and coexist, and must rely on imports. Whatever the reason, the government must take strategic measures to increase downstream industries and make the national economy grow at a higher rate. Suhariyanto has warned that strategic measures must be taken because manufacturing contributes 19.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). The processing industry also absorbs nearly 14% of the workforce, so the slowdown in these industries will have a major impact on economic growth. We are very worried that the proportion of manufacturing in GDP will continue to decrease and continue to decline. This has become one of the indicators, that is, Chinese people prefer to do raw materials, rather than value-added processed products business. If this trend continues, it will be difficult for our country to compete with other countries in the international market. So far, China’s export growth rate has slowed down year by year. The latest data shows that China's exports have contracted by 8.98% year-on-year. We need to pay attention to these central statistical office data, and urge the government to continue to work hard to create a business environment that is more conducive to investors, so that investment performance is constantly improving and highly competitive. We even need new breakthroughs to stimulate these investments so that they can be implemented faster. Our current economic performance is regressing compared to the era of a new order of rapid manufacturing development. In those days, the government established the industrial sector through carefully planned phases and systems, even through the inti-plasma system that allowed farmers to participate, so that their welfare improved with the development of industry. Therefore, the government must be able to carry out planned and sustainable industrial downstream projects, create jobs, and increase people's income and purchasing power. If there is no breakthrough in improving manufacturing performance, then the economic growth target will not be realized, the unemployment rate will tend to rise, and the people's income level will also tend to decline.
