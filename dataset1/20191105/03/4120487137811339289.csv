印度新德里污染指数创今年以来新高

05 Nov 2019, 03:57

【中新社4日讯】新德里消息：印度首都新德里及周边地区连日来空气污染严重，3日PM2.5平均浓度超过900微克/立方米，创今年以来新高。据“今日印度”报道，在风力作用下，新德里4日的污染指数有所下降，但依然处于重度污染状况。新德里市政府本月2日发布公共健康警报，要求全市学校停课至5日，所有建筑工地停工。从4日起，市政府对私家车采取限号出行措施。为解决出行问题，市政府大幅增加公交交通班次。印度地球科学部空气质量天气预报与研究系统（SAFAR）警告称，严重污染状况还将持续数日。SAFAR在分析此次严重污染状况的成因时指出，时下正值秋收之后，新德里周边的众多农户持续焚烧秸秆，造成大面积空气污染。此外，潮湿的气候条件不利于污染物的扩散。卫星照片显示，新德里周边地区上周共发生3000多起焚烧秸秆事件。据估计，新德里超四成的污染物来源于此。

India's New Delhi pollution index hit a new high this year

05 Nov 2019, 03:57

[Zhongguo Xinshe News Agency, 4th] New Delhi News: The Indian capital New Delhi and its surrounding areas have been polluted by air pollution for several days. The average concentration of PM2.5 on the 3rd exceeded 900 micrograms per cubic meter, a record high this year. According to ""India Today"", under the influence of wind, the pollution index of New Delhi on the 4th has declined, but it is still in a state of heavy pollution. The City of New Delhi issued a public health alert on the 2nd of this month, requiring schools in the city to suspend classes until the 5th, and all construction sites were shut down. From the 4th, the city government has taken restrictions on private cars. In order to solve the travel problem, the municipal government has greatly increased the number of bus traffic. The Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research System (SAFAR) of the Department of Earth Sciences of India warned that serious pollution will continue for several days. In analyzing the causes of this serious pollution situation, SAFAR pointed out that after the autumn harvest, many farmers around New Delhi continued to burn straw, causing large-scale air pollution. In addition, humid climatic conditions are not conducive to the spread of pollutants. Satellite photos show that there were more than 3,000 incidents of burning straw last week in the surrounding area of New Delhi. It is estimated that over 40% of the pollutants in New Delhi originate from this.
