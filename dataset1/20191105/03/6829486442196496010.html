      <h1>Today Is The 10th Birthday of My Dog Ida</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T03:01:53+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 03:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Today is November 5. It is the 10th birthday of my dog Ida.</p>
      <p>Ida is a black <a href="https://junkee.com/nsw-greyhound-racing-prizes/169692">greyhound</a> with a grey face and very long legs. This was her face when I told her that she had just turned 66 in dog years.</p>

      <p>It is the face that she makes whenever I am talking to her and not using the words ‘walk’, ‘cheese’, ‘treat’ or ‘dinner’. I think this is a face that says: “I do not know what you are talking about, but I am glad that I live in the same house as you.”</p>
      <p>Ida used to race. She was not very good at it. She raced for two years, and then she retired, and had a litter of puppies. Many years later, my partner and I were talking about what kind of dog that we would like. We decided that we would like a dog that is kind, gentle, and likes the things that we like: snoozing, going for walks, and snoozing some more.</p>
      <p>About two weeks later, we met Ida, who is kind, gentle, and likes the things that we like, chiefly snoozing.</p>
      <p>When Ida sleeps for a long time, her tongue hangs out of her mouth. It looks like this:</p>

      <p>Ida likes going in the car.</p>
      <p>Sometimes when she’s in the car, she makes this face:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Most of the time, however, Ida looks extremely regal.</p>
      <p>Take a look, for instance, at this photograph, which I decided made her look like a short story author from Connecticut, who has published a few well-liked but commercially unsuccessful books:</p>

      <p>Ida loves to zoomie. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2015122365281723">Lots of greyhounds love to do this.</a> It involves running extremely fast in a circle for a very short period of time.</p>
      <p>Because Ida is quite old, once she zoomied too hard and hurt her paw a little. It made her sad, but she got lots of peanut butter — her favourite food — and then she was happy again.</p>

      <p>I love Ida very much. I am happy that she is my friend.</p>
      <p>Please feel free to celebrate her birthday in the manner she would most appreciate: by eating peanut butter, snoozing, and being nice to your friends.</p>
