马来西亚矿泉水企业期待在进博会上 寻找新商机

05 Nov 2019, 03:50

【新华财经吉隆坡讯】在马来西亚霹雳州一座宁静的小城太平，有一个马来西亚家喻户晓的矿泉水品牌企业--Spritzer(事必胜)。这家企业从当地太平山脚下汲取纯净的矿泉水运往中国，并期待在即将到来的第二届中国国际进口博览会上寻找与中国及全球伙伴合作的新机会。事必胜是马来西亚最大的综合型矿泉水生产商，创立于1989年，目前年生产能力大约为7亿升。从公路通往生产厂区需要经过一条蜿蜒的小径，两边绿意葱茏，不时还有动物出没，在厂区门口的小树林里可以见到给松鼠、鸟类等定点投喂食物的标识，这是一个工厂，也是一个生态园。公司研发部门总监蔡昭宗向新华社记者介绍说，为了确保纯净的水质，公司将水源地周边330英亩(1英亩约合0.4公顷)的土地都购买下来，避免在采水点附近的其他工业生产和建设危害水质。对质量的严格把控帮助该公司近年来在马来西亚本地实现了40%的市场占有率。“从源头到瓶身，事必胜天然矿泉水都不会被人的手碰到，这是我们对消费者的承诺。我们希望为他们提供最优质的水。”他说。在马来西亚，地下水的开采必须先获得该国卫生部的批准，然后才能获准向公众推广销售。此外，该公司每小时都会在取水、灌装、成品等多个环境抽取水样，进行质量检测。蔡昭宗表示，他相信这些优势因素能够使他们的产品在进博会中脱颖而出，并希望借力中马两国之间良好的双边贸易关系，让产品在中国市场站稳脚跟。事必胜广州分公司助理品牌经理王睿铭表示，进博会作为国际贸易平台，是公司在中国和全球范围内获得更大推广并增加业务联系的理想选择。王睿铭介绍:“2018年，我们在第一届进博会上有机会接洽了许多商家，并在进博会结束后进行了更深入的了解与评估，最终与30多家公司达成了合作协议。我们期待今年能够通过这个平台取得更好成绩。”马来西亚国际贸易和工业部副部长王建民表示，在进博会上将会有更多的商业合作机会，他对此感到乐观，这将增加马来西亚今年对中国的出口。

Malaysian mineral water companies look forward to finding new business opportunities at the Expo

05 Nov 2019, 03:50

[Xinhua Finance Kuala Lumpur] In a quiet small town in Perak, Malaysia, there is a Malaysian household name brand, Spritzer. The company is pumping pure mineral water from the foot of the local Taiping Mountain to China and looks forward to finding new opportunities to cooperate with China and its global partners at the upcoming 2nd China International Import Expo. It is the largest integrated mineral water producer in Malaysia. It was founded in 1989 and currently has an annual production capacity of approximately 700 million liters. From the road to the production plant area, you need to go through a winding path, green on both sides, and animals from time to time. In the woods at the gate of the factory, you can see the signs of feeding food to squirrels, birds, etc. A factory is also an ecological park. Cai Zhaozong, director of the company's R&D department, told the Xinhua News Agency that in order to ensure pure water quality, the company purchased 330 acres (1 acre of about 0.4 hectares) of land around the water source to avoid other industrial production near the water harvesting point. And construction harms water quality. The strict control of quality has helped the company achieve a 40% market share in Malaysia in recent years. ""From the source to the bottle, the natural mineral water will not be touched by human hands. This is our commitment to consumers. We hope to provide them with the best quality water,"" he said. In Malaysia, groundwater must be approved by the Ministry of Health before it can be approved for sale to the public. In addition, the company extracts water samples in water, filling, finished products and other environments every hour for quality testing. Cai Zhaozong said that he believes that these advantages can make their products stand out in the Expo and hope to leverage the good bilateral trade relations between China and Malaysia to make their products stand firm in the Chinese market. Wang Ruiming, assistant brand manager of Guangzhou Branch, said that the Expo as an international trading platform is an ideal choice for the company to gain greater promotion and increase business contacts in China and around the world. Wang Ruiming introduced: ""In 2018, we had the opportunity to contact many merchants at the first Expo, and after the end of the Expo, we conducted a deeper understanding and evaluation, and finally reached a cooperation agreement with more than 30 companies. We look forward to better results through this platform this year.” Wang Jianmin, deputy director of the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said that there will be more business cooperation opportunities at the Expo, he is optimistic about this, which will increase Malaysia This year's exports to China.
