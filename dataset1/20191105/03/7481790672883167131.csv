　台風１９号による千曲川の堤防決壊で浸水被害があった長野市赤沼地区では、災害ごみの一時的な仮置き場となった赤沼公園に、住宅の廃材や壊れた家具などが数メートルの高さまで積まれている。被災から３週間が経過し、周囲の木々は赤や黄色に色づき始めたが、災害ごみは一向に減っていない。
　長野地方気象台によると、長野市は５日朝、最低気温が１・８度を記録。先月１９日以降、同公園では自衛隊が夜間にごみを運び出しているが、日中には住民らが泥だらけのテーブルや浸水した住宅の床材などを搬入し、山積みの状態が続いている。
　同市赤沼の自宅の１階が浸水した女性（７５）は「家のものは全部捨てた。ここは休日の憩いの場だったのに」と悲嘆に暮れた。

In the Akanuma area of Nagano city, where damage was caused by the typhoon 19 due to the bank breakup of the Chikuma River, Akanuma Park, which was a temporary temporary storage area for disaster waste, was a few meters high. It is piled up. Three weeks have passed since the disaster, and the surrounding trees began to turn red and yellow, but the amount of disaster waste has not decreased.
According to the Nagano Regional Meteorological Observatory, Nagano City recorded a minimum temperature of 1.8 degrees in the morning of the 5th. Since the 19th of last month, the Self-Defense Forces have been carrying out garbage at night in the park, but during the day, residents have been carrying muddy tables and flooded house flooring, and are still piled up.
The woman (75), who flooded the first floor of her home in Akanuma, said in a grief saying, ""I threw away everything in my house. It was a holiday resting place.""
