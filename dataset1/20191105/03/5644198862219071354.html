      <p>SANTIAGO: A visitor wondering what the deadly unrest in Chile is about can learn a lot from the graffiti that has blanketed the capital's streets.</p>
      <p>AFP has photographed some of the striking slogans and murals in Santiago as Chileans vent their rage at the government.</p>

        <b>'DIGNITY!'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Protests against a rise in traffic fares swelled into a general outpouring of rage at economic hardship, expensive education and healthcare and tight pensions.</p>
      <p>Many of the graffiti made a scrawled plea for "Dignity".</p>
      <p>"They won't keep us quiet any longer," the slogans warn. "The status quo is slavery for us."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'TORTURE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>After starting three weeks ago, the demonstrations descended into deadly clashes between protesters and police.</p>

      <p>Twenty people have been killed in the unrest. UN human rights authorities are investigating allegations of police brutality.</p>
      <p>"They kill, rape and torture," the graffiti say.</p>
      <p>"They are drinking the blood of the people."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'RESIGN'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The central target of the crowds' fury is Chile's billionaire conservative president, Sebastian Pinera.</p>
      <p>Countless graffiti cry out for his resignation - or worse.</p>
      <p>He at first responded to the unrest by claiming the country was "at war".</p>
      <p>"We are not at war," the graffiti roared back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CONSTITUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>The protesters are demanding constitutional reform. Chile's current constitution dates back to the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p>
      <p>The words "New constitution!" are scrawled on walls in giant letters.</p>
      <p>Several opposition parties and officials have backed plans to discuss a new constitution.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'REVOLUTION'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Among the puns and rhetorical figures of speech, classic revolutionary language screams from the murals: injustice, rebellion, victory.</p>
      <p>"The rich ones' democracy is the poor ones' dictatorship."</p>
      <p>"If revolution is necessary, revolution is possible."</p>
      <p>
        <b>VICTIMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Graffiti specialist Alvaro Ramirez says the outpouring of street painting in Santiago is reminiscent of the 1970s, when artists would defy the curfew to go out and paint murals.</p>
      <p>The whole length of Santiago's eight-kilometre Alameda avenue has been covered in paintings and slogans. Some murals commemorate those killed in the unrest.</p>
      <p>Only one building has escaped the graffiti: the heavily guarded La Moneda presidential palace.</p>
