【海外网】由于怀疑指定暴力团体“山口组”成员涉及特殊诈骗案件，日本警视厅4日派出约80名警力，搜查其位于兵库县神户市的总部。这是10月11日以来，“山口组”总部第二次被大批警察“光顾”。据日本《朝日新闻》4日报道，日本警视厅的约80位搜查员，4日上午列队进入“山口组”总部，进行了40分钟左右的搜查。10月30日，警视厅曾逮捕了涉及3起特殊诈骗案（涉案总额约合人民币36.5万元）的7名“山口组”成员。据称，他们被指派从受害者手中收取现金和银行卡，并有组织地涉及其他案件。警方怀疑涉案资金被“山口组”成员上交总部，4日的搜查主要是为了调查资金流向。另据日媒早前报道，10月10日下午，“山口组”一名68岁成员当街开枪打死了另一个指定暴力团体“神户山口组”的2名成员。报道分析称，枪击案原因可能是“山口组”二号头目、现年72岁的高山清司即将出狱，各大黑帮为了不给他添麻烦，都想在其出狱前对既有恩怨进行清算。

[Overseas] As a result of suspected violent group members of the Yamaguchi Group involved in special fraud cases, the Japanese Police Agency sent about 80 police officers on the 4th to search its headquarters in Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture. This is the second time that the “Yamaguchi Group” headquarters has been “patented” by a large number of police officers since October 11. According to the Japanese ""Asahi Shimbun"" reported on the 4th, about 80 searchers in the Japanese Police Department entered the ""Yamaguchi Group"" headquarters on the morning of the 4th and conducted a search of about 40 minutes. On October 30, the Metropolitan Police Department arrested seven members of the Yamaguchi Group who involved three special fraud cases involving a total amount of approximately RMB 365,000. They were allegedly assigned to collect cash and bank cards from the victims and organized other cases. The police suspected that the funds involved were handed over to the headquarters by the members of the ""Yamaguchi Group"". The search on the 4th was mainly to investigate the flow of funds. According to Japanese media earlier, on the afternoon of October 10, a 68-year-old member of the ""Yamaguchi group"" shot and killed two members of another designated violent group ""Kobe Yamaguchi Group"". According to the report, the cause of the shooting may be that the No. 2 leader of the Yamaguchi Group, the 72-year-old Takayama Kiyoshi is about to be released from prison. The major gangs want to clear the existing grievances before they are released from prison. .
