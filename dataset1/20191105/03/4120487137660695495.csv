汉字教学并不难，找对方法是关键

05 Nov 2019, 03:40

2019年11月2日上午9点，雅加达华语课程教师学会与博修达大学联手举办了一次汉字教学交流座谈会。参加此次座谈会的嘉宾有：博修达外语系院长BapakEkoCahyono、中文系主任HinGoanGunawan以及其他中文系讲师和学生、雅加达华语课程教师学会会长林莉萍、主讲教师黄端珠、雅加达以及周边地区的高中华文教师等。在座谈会的嘉宾发言中，林莉萍会长感谢博修达外语系及中文系对华文事业的大力支持，提供场地和餐点，让各位老师能够有机会聚在一起交流汉语教学经验。同时，感谢黄端珠老师百忙之中抽出时间为大家解读汉字教学的奥妙。随后，BapakEkoCahyono院长在讲话中对大家的到来表示热烈的欢迎，提到印尼华文教育复苏以后，早在1986年博修达大学就开设了中文系，这些年来一直都在为汉语教学默默地贡献着自己的力量，并且希望通过这次座谈会老师们能够满载而归。此次座谈会的主讲是黄端珠老师，她在印尼从事汉语教学几十年，对学生在学习汉字过程中会遇到什么样的难点，易犯什么样的错误，都深有研究，是一位资深的汉字教学专家。黄端珠老师主要从拼音教学和汉字教学两个方面进行讲解。汉字是音义形三位一体的文字，学习拼音是认识汉字的第一步。在印尼，汉语作为第二语言教学常常会受到印尼语的影响。长得一模一样的26个字母，因为语言不同，所以发音也存在着很大的差异。黄老师将这些拼音与印尼字母进行对比，找出异同，进行分类。例如，在教声母时，拼音中的“m、n、f、h、l”与印尼语字母发音相同，可以将这5个拼音放在一起教授，以便学生记忆。当遇到发音困难的字母时，则可以运用多种方法进行教授。图片法，教学时利用图片，让学生模仿进行发音，学“o”时嘴唇要像甜甜圈，学“u”时要学小海马，学“e”时要咬住铅笔再发音。拼读法，在教送气音时，可将声母与已学的简单的韵母相拼造词。例如“b、p”可以教“baba pa”;“g、k”可以教“guguku”；“d、t”可以教“diditi”等。拟声法，利用印尼语中对声音的表达。比如，“a”学乌鸦叫；“i”咬指甲“gigit”等。所以，在实际的教学过程中，老师们需要抓住拼音的发音特点，利用各种教学技巧，将教学趣味化。对于印尼人而言，汉字就像是一副画，大脑中没有笔画顺序的概念，所以将汉字写成字母与数字的组合或当成画简笔画是常有的事儿。其实汉字最大的特点就是象形，找对教学方法，汉字一点也不难。在初级水平，学生接触到的汉字多为独体字，且大多部分为象形字，例如“日、目、木、水、山、火、母……”这些汉字都可以通过甲骨文或生活中的图片，让学生了解到这些字的由来。随着学习的深入，学生字的储备量加大，逐步学习偏旁部首与合体字。此时老师们要带学生找规律，例如，江、河、海、湖、清……因为都和水有关，所以部首均为“氵”。总结形声字，即两个文字合成一个字，一个表事物类别一个表读音，例如左形右声的汉字有清、请、情、晴等，这些字的发音都和“青”相关，而“青”正是这些字的声旁。黄端珠老师说，学生如果能掌握56个常用的偏旁部首就已经很了不起了。老师们在教学时不能只是简单地告诉学生部首的名称，要告诉学生为什么这个部首这样写，为什么这些字里都有相同的部分，再通过生动的配图演示，让学生知道，原来汉字里面有如此多的奥妙。汉字教学其实并不难，找对方法是关键。在短短几个小时的座谈会中，黄老师让大家感受到汉字教学的寓教于乐。在会后的交流与答疑中，老师们纷纷在笔记本中记下这些宝贵的经验，好在今后的教学中发挥作用。汉字教学不是一蹴而就，需要坚持不懈的努力，而这每一次的交流都是为下一次的成功添砖加瓦。 (汉语教师志愿者查丽娟供稿供图)

Chinese character teaching is not difficult, finding the right method is the key

05 Nov 2019, 03:40

At 9:00 am on November 2, 2019, the Jakarta Chinese Language Teachers Association and Bo Xi Da University jointly held a symposium on Chinese character teaching exchange. The guests who participated in the symposium were: Bapak EkoCahyono, Dean of the Department of Foreign Languages of Bosuda, HinGoan Gunawan, Director of the Chinese Department, and other Chinese lecturers and students, Lin Liping, President of the Jakarta Chinese Language Teachers Association, Huang Duzhu, the lecturer, Jakarta and high school Chinese in the surrounding areas. Teachers, etc. During the guest speaker's speech, President Lin Liping thanked Bosuda's Department of Foreign Languages and Chinese Department for their support of the Chinese language industry, providing venues and meals, so that teachers can have the opportunity to gather together to exchange Chinese teaching experience. At the same time, I would like to thank Professor Huang Duanzhu for taking the time to explain the mystery of Chinese teaching. Later, Dean Bapak EkoCahyono expressed his warm welcome to everyone's arrival. After the recovery of Indonesian Chinese education, the Chinese Department was opened in Botswana University in 1986. Over the years, he has been silently contributing to Chinese teaching. With their own strength, and hope that the teachers will be able to return home with this symposium. The main speaker of the symposium is Mr. Huang Duanzhu. She has been teaching Chinese in Indonesia for decades. She has deep research on what kind of difficulties students are experiencing in the process of learning Chinese characters. Senior Chinese character teaching expert. Teacher Huang Duanzhu mainly explained from two aspects of Pinyin teaching and Chinese character teaching. Chinese characters are the trinity of the sound and meaning. Learning Pinyin is the first step in understanding Chinese characters. In Indonesia, Chinese as a second language is often influenced by Indonesian. The 26 letters that look exactly the same, because the language is different, so the pronunciation is also very different. Teacher Huang compares these pinyin with the Indonesian alphabet to find out the similarities and differences and classify them. For example, when teaching the initials, the “m, n, f, h, l” in the pinyin is the same as the Indonesian alphabet, and the five pinyin can be taught together for the students to remember. When encountering letters that are difficult to pronounce, you can use a variety of methods to teach. Picture method, use pictures when teaching, let students imitate pronunciation, learn ""o"" when the lips are like doughnuts, learn ""u"" when learning small hippocampus, learn ""e"" when you want to bite the pencil and then pronounce. The spelling method, when teaching the air, can be used to match the initials with the simple vowels that have been learned. For example, ""b, p"" can teach ""baba pa""; ""g, k"" can teach ""guguku""; ""d, t"" can teach ""diditi"" and so on. The pseudo-sound method uses the expression of sound in Indonesian. For example, ""a"" learns to crow; ""i"" bites nail ""gigit"" and so on. Therefore, in the actual teaching process, teachers need to grasp the pronunciation characteristics of Pinyin and use various teaching techniques to make teaching interesting. For Indonesians, Chinese characters are like a painting. There is no concept of stroke order in the brain. Therefore, it is often a common practice to write Chinese characters as a combination of letters and numbers or as a shorthand drawing. In fact, the biggest feature of Chinese characters is the pictogram. It is not difficult to find the right teaching method. At the primary level, the Chinese characters that students are exposed to are mostly single characters, and most of them are pictographs. For example, ""Japanese, Mesh, Wood, Water, Mountain, Fire, Mother..."" can be used in Oracle or in life. Pictures, let students know the origin of these words. With the deepening of learning, the reserve of student words has increased, and gradually learn the radicals and the matching characters. At this point, the teachers should bring students to find the rules, for example, rivers, rivers, seas, lakes, and clear... Because they are all related to water, the radicals are all ""氵"". Summarize the shape of the word, that is, two words to synthesize one word, one table of things, one table of pronunciation, for example, the left-right and right-handed Chinese characters are clear, please, love, sunny, etc., the pronunciation of these words are related to ""green"", and "" ""Green"" is the sound of these words. Teacher Huang Duanzhu said that if students can master 56 commonly used radicals, they are already very remarkable. When teaching, teachers can't just tell the name of the student's radicals. Tell the students why the radicals are written like this. Why do these words have the same parts? Then, through the vivid demonstration, let the students know that the original Chinese characters There are so many mysteries inside. Chinese character teaching is not difficult, and finding the right method is the key. In just a few hours of symposium, Mr. Huang made everyone feel the fun of teaching Chinese characters. In the post-meeting exchanges and Q&A, the teachers wrote down these valuable experiences in their notebooks to play a role in the future teaching. Chinese character teaching is not a one-off process, and it requires constant and unremitting efforts, and each exchange is to contribute to the next success.
