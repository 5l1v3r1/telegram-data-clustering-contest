      <p>The cruel last words of a killer executed for murdering a doughnut shop co-worker have been revealed.</p>
      <p>Charles Rhines, 63, from South Dakota, US, told the parents of his victim Donnivan Schaeffer, 22, that he 'forgave' them for their 'anger and hatred' towards him.</p>
      <p>Rhines stabbed Mr Schaeffer to death while robbing the doughnut shop in Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1992.</p>
      <p>He was executed at the South Dakota State Penitentiary, in Sioux Falls, at 7.39pm local time last night.</p>

      <p>Speaking just before his execution, Rhines <a href="https://eu.argusleader.com/story/news/2019/11/04/charles-rhines-execution-these-were-convicted-killers-last-words/4146532002/">reportedly</a> said: "Ed and Peggy Schaeffer, I forgive you for your anger and hatred toward me.</p>
      <p>"I pray to God that he forgives you for your anger and hatred toward me. Thanks to my team. I love you all, goodbye. Let's go. That's all I have to say. Goodbye."</p>
      <p>The victim's mum told a press conference last night: "Today do something kind for someone in honor (of Donnivan)... he is loved and missed and will never be forgotten.</p>
      <p>"We will miss him, and have missed him for so long."</p>

      <p>She described her son as 'the boy with a goofy, contagious laugh' who would have been a great asset to society.</p>
      <p>The mother added that last night's execution marked 'relief and justice'.</p>
      <p>Mr Schaeffer’s fiancée, who witnessed the murderer's death, added: “This closes the book on Rhines, but we will forever feel the pain and emotion."</p>
      <p>The US Supreme Court had denied three 11th-hour petitions for stays of Rhines' execution.</p>

      <p>The murderer's last meal request was fried chicken, the fruit cantaloupe or musk melon and the Norwegian flatbread lefsa.</p>
      <p>He also ordered yogurt, butter, black licorice, cookies and cream ice cream, root beer and coffee with cream and sugar.</p>
      <p>The murderer believed he was targeted by an anti-gay bias as testimony showed some jury thought it would be better for him to die than to co-habit with another man.</p>
      <p>One juror, Harry Keeney, told Rhines' legal team: "We also knew that he was a homosexual and thought that he shouldn't be able to spend life with men in prison."</p>
