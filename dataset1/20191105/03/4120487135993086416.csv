美商务部长称 美企将“很快”获得向华为出售产品的许可

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

【路透讯】据上周日刊出的彭博采访，美国商务部长罗斯表示，美国企业将“很快”获得向中国华为技术有限公司出售零部件的许可。罗斯说，这些许可“将很快颁布”，美国政府已经收到206份许可申请。“有很多申请—坦率地说，比我们想象的要多，”罗斯补充说。华为没有立即回应置评请求。全球最大电信设备供应商华为在5月被美国以国家安全疑虑为由列入黑名单，在没有特别许可的情况下，实际上无法购买美国制造的零部件，美国企业也同样要有特别许可，否则禁止向华为出售产品。美国总统特朗普6月承诺，将为与华为有生意往来的公司提供部分松绑。在谈及美中贸易情势进展时，罗斯表示没有理由不能如期在本月签署协议。“我们的情况很好，正在取得良好进展，没有什么无法达成的自然原因，”彭博引述罗斯的谈话表示。

US Secretary of Commerce said that US companies will soon obtain permission to sell products to Huawei.

05 Nov 2019, 03:37

[Reuters] According to an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Ross said that US companies will soon be allowed to sell parts to China Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Ross said that the licenses ""will be issued soon"" and the US government has received 206 license applications. “There are a lot of applications – frankly, more than we think,” Rose added. Huawei did not immediately respond to the request for comment. Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier, was blacklisted in May by the United States on the grounds of national security concerns. Without special permission, it is virtually impossible to purchase US-made parts. US companies also have special permits. Otherwise, it is forbidden to sell products to Huawei. US President Trump promised in June that it will partially loosen the company that has business dealings with Huawei. When talking about the progress of the US-China trade situation, Ross said that there is no reason not to sign the agreement as scheduled this month. ""Our situation is very good, good progress is being made, there is nothing natural that cannot be achieved,"" Bloomberg quoted Ross's conversation.
