      <h1>Former Olympic hurdles champion Harper Nelson aims for Tokyo 2020</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON: American 100m hurdler Dawn <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harper-Nelson">Harper Nelson</a>, the 2008 Olympic champion and 2012 Olympic runner-up who retired to have a baby, said Monday she is training for next year's Tokyo <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympics">Olympics</a>.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old from suburban St. Louis was second to Australia's Sally Pearson at the 2017 World Championships but missed this year's meet after giving birth to a baby girl last April.</p>
      <p>Harper Nelson stepped away from the sport in September 2018 but worked out during her pregnancy and returned to the track a month after giving birth.</p>
      <p>"I still think I have it and I can kill it," Harper Nelson said in a posting on the US Olympic website.</p>
      <p>"All the women in my life had said when they were moms they stopped their dream. Once I had my daughter, I looked at her and I remember thinking, 'I still have this yearn to run.'</p>
      <p>"And I refuse for her to say, when she looked at my career, 'My mom always said she wanted to keep running, but she stopped because she had me.'"</p>
      <p>Harper Nelson overtook teammate Lolo Jones late to capture gold in Beijing 11 years ago and settled for silver in London behind Pearson four years later.</p>
      <p>She kept herself available for drug testing during her year off and told US Olympic broadcaster NBC she has spoken with New Zealand shot putter Valerie Adams, a two-time Olympic champion, who was pregnant with her second child during Harper Nelson's pregnancy.</p>
      <p>But Harper Nelson struggled at first with speed and doubt.</p>
      <p>"That initial burst of speed to get off the line, it just was lacking," Harper Nelson said. "I really had a moment where I sat down and kind of cried. I was thinking, 'Do you ever really get that back? Is it possible?'</p>
      <p>"We slowly just gradually did things and gradually got myself back."</p>
      <p>But medical advisors said allowing her body some rest helped her feel her best in years.</p>
      <p>Husband Alonzo Nelson will be her coach while she trains on her high school track in East St. Louis, Illinois, in what is likely a one-year comeback.</p>
      <p>"I really do feel like this would probably be it because we want more kids," she told NBC.</p>
