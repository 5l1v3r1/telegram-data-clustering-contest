东盟国家制造业采购经理指数10月降至48.5

05 Nov 2019, 03:50

【新华财经新加坡讯】金融信息公司IHS Markit (IHS马基特公司)公布的最新数据报告显示，10月东盟地区制造业采购经理指数(PMI)从9月的49.1下降到48.5。数据表明，这是东盟地区制造业情况连续第5个月处于萎缩状态。10月的东盟地区制造业采购经理指数是自2015年11月以来的最低点。拖累该指数的原因一方面是当月制造业产出和新增订单下降速度有所加快，另一方面是制造业的用工水平以2015年底以来的最快速度下降。制造业采购经理指数高于50点枯荣线说明制造业正在扩张，低于50点则显示制造业萎缩。10月份，报告涉及的7个东盟国家中只有2个国家的指数在50以上。报告涉及的7个国家分别是缅甸、菲律宾、泰国、越南、马来西亚、印尼和新加坡。缅甸制造业的运营状况继续改善，10月PMI指数达到53，为6月以来最高水平，原因是产出和新增订单都强势增长，而用工水平也继续增长。菲律宾制造业的运营状况也略有改善，PMI指数为52.1。泰国制造业的PMI指数降至50，而越南制造业的PMI指数也降到了50，结束了自IHS Markit开始调查以来越南制造业连续了46个月的扩张。另一方面，马来西亚制造业的运营状况连续第13个月处于萎缩状态，PMI指数达到49.3。印尼制造业状况也在继续恶化，PMI指数下降到了47.7，接近4年来最低点。新加坡制造业的经营状况又出现大幅下滑，PMI指数降至41.4，是2012年8月以来的最低点。报告称，今年10月，东盟制造业整体来说仍在苦苦挣扎，运营状况以接近4年来最快的速度恶化。导致这种情况出现的主要原因之一是产出继续下降，而且下降幅度是2015年11月以来的最快水平。同时，订单量连续第三个月下降，降幅接近4年来最大水平；海外新增业务也在减少。10月东盟国家制造业继续减少用工，用工下降速度达到了2015年底以来的最高水平。尽管如此，制造业企业的积压订单量还在以2月以来最快的速度减少。与此同时，10月份通胀压力有所减弱。投入品价格仅温和上涨，涨幅为调查有史以来最低。产出费用没有变化，结束了连续83个月的出厂价持续上涨情况。10月份的PMI数据显示，东盟国家制造业的采购活动进一步下降，降幅加速至2015年11月以来的最高水平。同时，制造业企业的生产前库存下降，且降幅是自7月以来的最快水平，但总体来说幅度不大。展望未来，10月份东盟国家制造业企业对未来一年产出的预期依然保持乐观，只是乐观程度已降至3月以来的最低水平。IHS Markit经济学家路易斯库帕表示，10月东盟国家制造业进一步萎缩，整体PMI跌至近4年来的低点。各国当中，只有缅甸和菲律宾制造业的运营状况有所改善，与此形成鲜明对比的是，新加坡的情况明显恶化，马来西亚则进一步恶化。

ASEAN manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 48.5 in October

05 Nov 2019, 03:50

[Xinhua Finance News] The latest data report released by financial information company IHS Markit (IHS Markit) shows that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) in the ASEAN region fell to 48.5 in October from 49.1 in September. The data shows that this is the fifth consecutive month of shrinking manufacturing conditions in the ASEAN region. The October ASEAN Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was the lowest since November 2015. The reason for dragging the index is that on the one hand, the manufacturing industry and new orders have slowed down in the month, and on the other hand, the manufacturing level of the manufacturing industry has fallen at the fastest rate since the end of 2015. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index is above 50 points. The dry line indicates that the manufacturing industry is expanding. Below 50 points indicates that the manufacturing industry is shrinking. In October, only two of the seven ASEAN countries covered by the report had an index of more than 50. The seven countries covered in the report are Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The operating conditions of the manufacturing industry in Myanmar continued to improve. The PMI index reached 53 in October, the highest level since June, as output and new orders both grew strongly, while employment levels continued to grow. The operating conditions of the Philippine manufacturing industry also improved slightly, with a PMI of 52.1. The manufacturing industry's PMI index fell to 50, while the Vietnamese manufacturing PMI index fell to 50, ending the 46-month expansion of Vietnam's manufacturing industry since IHS Markit began investigations. On the other hand, Malaysia's manufacturing operations have been shrinking for the 13th consecutive month, with a PMI of 49.3. The manufacturing situation in Indonesia is also continuing to deteriorate, with the PMI index falling to 47.7, the lowest in four years. The manufacturing situation in Singapore has fallen sharply, with the PMI index falling to 41.4, the lowest since August 2012. According to the report, in October this year, the ASEAN manufacturing industry was still struggling as a whole, and its operating conditions deteriorated at the fastest rate in nearly four years. One of the main reasons for this is that output continues to decline, and the decline is the fastest since November 2015. At the same time, orders fell for the third consecutive month, the decline was close to the highest level in four years; overseas new business is also decreasing. In October, the manufacturing industry in ASEAN countries continued to reduce employment, and the rate of employment decline reached the highest level since the end of 2015. Despite this, the backlog of manufacturing companies is still decreasing at the fastest rate since February. At the same time, inflationary pressures have weakened in October. The price of input products only rose moderately, the highest increase in the history of the survey. There was no change in output costs, ending the continuous increase in ex-factory prices for 83 consecutive months. The PMI data for October showed that the procurement activities of ASEAN countries' manufacturing industries further declined, and the decline accelerated to the highest level since November 2015. At the same time, pre-production inventories of manufacturing companies have fallen, and the decline is the fastest since July, but overall it is not large. Looking ahead, the expectations of manufacturing companies in ASEAN countries for the next year will remain optimistic in October, but the level of optimism has fallen to its lowest level since March. IHS Markit economist Louis Cooper said that in October the manufacturing industry in ASEAN countries shrank further and the overall PMI fell to a low of nearly four years. In contrast, only Myanmar and the Philippines have improved their manufacturing operations. In stark contrast, the situation in Singapore has deteriorated significantly and Malaysia has deteriorated further.
