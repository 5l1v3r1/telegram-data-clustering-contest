05 Nov 2019, 04:13

【点滴新闻网雅加达讯】国电公司（PLN）前总经理索菲安·巴希尔（Sofyan Basir）坦诚说，他对肃贪法庭的无罪判决表示感谢。索菲安也感谢所有支持他的各界人士。索菲安周一（11月4日）在雅加达肃贪法庭作出判决后说，“我感恩真主给予最好的，我可以在外面自由，为社区做最好的事情。”此前，索菲安被肃贪会检察官起诉5年徒刑，罚款2亿盾或3个月监禁。罪名是为商人约翰（Johanes Budisutrisno Kotjo）提供便利，贿赂前国会议员埃尼·毛拉尼·萨拉吉（Eni Maulani Saragih）和前社会部长伊德鲁斯·玛尔哈姆（Idrus Marham）。但是，法官小组指出，没有证据证明索菲安犯下肃贪会检察官所说的罪名。法官说，索菲安没有涉嫌参与爪哇巴厘岛电力投资公司（PJBI）和黑金自然资源有限公司（BNR Ltd）与中国华电工程有限公司（CHEC Ltd）之间的廖内蒸汽发电厂独立电力生产商项目协议程序有关的贿赂案。法官说，索菲安在前国会议员埃尼接受商人约翰贿赂方面没有发挥任何协助作用。
