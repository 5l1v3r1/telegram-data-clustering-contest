Pokemon Sword and Shield price in India
With a release date of November 15, you can pre-order Pokemon Sword and Shield for Rs. 4,299 apiece via Games The Shop and MCube Games. While other sites and stores are yet to bother listing the Nintendo Switch exclusives, they should hopefully maintain the same price range. This is a welcome change from the ridiculous Rs. 4,999 price we saw for Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee, Super Mario Maker 2, and the soon to be released Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3.
With a Rs. 4,299 price, it puts Pokemon in the same league as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Death Stranding, and FIFA 20, all of which occupy the Rs. 3,999 to Rs. 4,499 range. And with most Switch owners having multiple consoles, the competitive day one price means that fans won’t have to resort to the grey market, parallel imports, or digital downloads, all of which are around $60 (almost Rs. 4,200). Reason being, this is, much like Super Mario Maker 2 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, an official listing with customers getting a bill and after sales support. The competitive pricing makes Pokemon Sword and Shield a day one option for the country’s many Pokemon fans.
Pokemon Sword and Shield download size
If you prefer getting them digitally, the Pokemon Sword and Shield download size is 9.5GB on the Nintendo Switch. This is of course, per game and not the total download size of both games.
