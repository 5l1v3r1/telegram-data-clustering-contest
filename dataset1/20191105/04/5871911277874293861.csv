The November 4 edition of WWE Monday Night Raw took place live at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. This particular episode featured The Beast Incarnate, as well as The Game and he did not come alone.

The program opened with serval limousines arriving at the building. Triple H got out of one and the show was officially underway.
Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman came to the ring and bragged about beating Cain Velasquez at Crown Jewel on October 31. He then warned that Lesnar was going to find Rey Mysterio and commit a felony against him.
Heyman and Lesnar went backstage, where Brock manhandled a few different people.



A video rewind of the historic Crown Jewel match between Natalya and Lacey Evans was shown next.

-Charlotte Flair and Natalya defeated The Kabuki Warriors

Brock and Heyman appeared on the Raw stage, where Paul confronted Jerry Lawler. Fellow commentator Dio Maddin came to Jerry’s defense and was given an F-5 through the announce table as a result.
Rey suddenly appeared with a bat, attacking Brock and smashing him across the knees. When Raw comes back from commercial, Mysterio is backstage and demands a match with Lesnar at Survivor Series on November 24.

-Buddy Murphy defeated Cedric Alexander

A video rewind of NXT’s invasion on Friday Night SmackDown is shown, leading to Seth Rollins coming down to the ring. Seth talked about losing his title to The Fiend and said he didn’t know what he was going to do next.
Seth was then interrupted by Triple H, who reminded him of what he’s done for him in the past. Hunter said he knew how to make Rollins great and that Seth was either with him, or against him. This brought out The Undisputed Era.



The O.C. then came out and charged after The Undisputed Era, who took a step back. But then Dominik Dijakovic and Damian Priest showed up, followed by members of the Raw roster. The action came to a standstill and Seth Rollins left the ring without saying another word.
When Raw came back from commercial, Rollins confronted Hunter backstage and demanded an NXT Championship match against Adam Cole. Triple H agreed.
Andrade and Zelina Vega were out next. Zelina said the crowd had the chance to see them humiliate Sin Cara and the new masked female Luchador, Carolina.
