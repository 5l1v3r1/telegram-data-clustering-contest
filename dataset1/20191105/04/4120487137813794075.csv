美政府认证不够 737MAX复飞后航空公司将演示飞行

05 Nov 2019, 04:20

【中新网】就算美国联邦政府和波音公司表示，目前停飞的波音737MAX飞机可以安全飞行，航空公司也将会再进行自己的“特殊检查”：当飞机获准飞行时，航空公司将在没有乘客的情况下，进行自己的演示飞行。据报道，届时将会有高级官员乘坐航班，来提振民众对737MAX波音飞机的信心。美国航空公司、联合航空公司和西南航空公司也都将采取相关措施。据悉，美国航空公司和联合航空公司已将该型飞机的复飞计划推迟到2020年1月，西南航空公司则将其推迟到2020年2月。上周，代表美国航空公司空乘人员的一个组织致信波音公司首席执行官丹尼斯米伦伯格，称他们希望在重新登机之前，对飞机是否安全有发言权。2018年10月，一架狮航波音737 MAX客机在爪哇海坠机，造成189人丧命。几个月后，埃航公司一架波音737MAX也坠毁，机上157人罹难。两起空难发生后，波音737MAX机型在全球遭禁飞。
