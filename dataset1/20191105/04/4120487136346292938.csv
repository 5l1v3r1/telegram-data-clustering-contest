为增进校友之情谊,促进居住国内外校友的情谊和外地的交流,与及并回馈他们校友多年来的热诚付出,印尼国立台湾大学校友会于2019年10月5-6日举办了”露营”活动。 (10/05)星期六的早晨，在苏加武眉清新空气的迎接下，从雅加达出发的近八十位台大校友们来到百多里外露营区！道路崎岖，舟车劳顿也抵挡不住老同学相见的兴奋.炎炎夏日更激活了大家的热情。在踏入社会，饱经风霜之后，大伙欣喜地又可以无拘无束，互相问好，谈天说地一头栽进当年记忆模糊了的喜悦中。爪哇岛是世界人口密度最大岛屿之一,从雅加达到西爪哇苏加武眉海岸,大约150公里路，路途四个多小时。当天我们也赶上根据印尼旅游部消息，苏加武眉古农湖属于东南亚最长吊桥吊桥日前在今年2019年三月正式启用。大桥长约250米，宽约2米，距离地面150米，吊桥最大承重55吨。古农湖吊桥位于印尼风景秀丽的古农湖旅游公园内。吊桥的开放时间为每天7时30分到17时30分，票价为5万印尼盾。为了确保安全，公园管理方允许最多40人同时登桥。吊桥启用前，观光客从山谷一面走到另一面需要至少一个小时，现在只需要15分钟。吊桥的启用对提高古农湖旅游公园的国内外游客人数有积极的推动作用。古农湖吊桥位于热带雨林中的人工湖，平时雾气弥漫，在阳光斜射下就像一幅美丽的水墨画。除了古农湖吊桥，附近还有萨维尔瀑布等景点，每年吸引成千上万名国内外游客。 傍晚冷风飕飕，绵绵细雨却浇不熄大家的热情，在忙碌的生活中，也得给自己放松和同学相聚一起看白云蓝天,数星星看月亮，呼吸新鲜空气。在寒冷的夜里，大家把自己裹在外套中在营火会上叙叙旧,高声合唱杜鹃花,龙的传人,童年,阿里山的姑娘,月亮代表我的心等等校园歌曲，青春的回忆涌上心头，气氛格外的放松也惹起不断的笑声,尤其到了抽奖的时刻大家又期待头奖华航雅加达台北来回机票将会落在哪位幸运者?精彩的节目就一列载满欢乐喜的火车，乘客们在车厢里脑力激荡，进行各种好玩、有趣的活动，共同驶向下一段人生的旅程。同学会最令人开心的，莫过于回味那些讲了多少次也不会腻的青春回忆。在当年青春的日子里，我们憧憬着绚烂的未来，企盼着前途的无限可能，当中却也参杂许多疑问，错综复杂的人际关系，使到大家有讲不完的话题，不知不觉夜色已深,明天还有更精彩的节目等着我们呢!清晨,薄雾弥漫,湖上日出并不耀眼,湖面上的吊桥隐约可见,清晨的冷风有如利刃催促我们在太阳未升起前赶到吊桥空拍“团体视频”。视频中大家脚步轻健，老少同欢，心情的舒畅，的确有返老还童的功效。在好梦初醒睡意未消伴随着山风吹拂下，摇晃起伏的桥面，令人趑趄不前，提心吊胆地踏稳脚步，却不能不心跳加快,手脚冰冷,还好大家手牵手肩并肩度过这刺激的考验,也让人挑战自我极限。 （李商隐的句子是悲情的，和这个气氛不相容，不可以用）。 自成景观脑海且想起李商隐《锦瑟》“此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然”太阳从地平线上升起,照亮了大地,太阳满满地爬高,天开始亮了,香喷喷的早餐的香味扑鼻而来,大家一拥而上尽情享用。自由活动时间到了,有的去瀑布吸收正能量,深深呼吸芬多精,有的继续分享未完的故事,不知不觉午后到来，同学们体验了营区身心洗涤，断续沉沉的蝉声伴随着清脆高昂的森林鸟语声，叮咛着我们好好守护初心,我们带着各自的能量光芒，碰撞出新的火花,不只是凝聚旧朋友，还能结交创造新朋友,开发出无穷的新点子。校友会应该能够发挥休戚与共，和衷共济的精神 不仅如此,只是吃吃喝喝，还能群聚一起做一件有意义的事，我们更凝聚了大家的力量创造展望更美好的未来。印尼台大校友希望营造一种开放的氛围，不管来自何处，背景如何，都能感到同样的温暖，没有心机，也没有较量。在午后的太阳余晖中，大家怀着满满的精神收获，踏上归途。(印尼台大校友会文宣组纪录)

In order to enhance the friendship of alumni, promote the friendship between domestic and foreign alumni and exchanges in the field, and give back to their alumni for their enthusiasm for many years, the Indonesian National Taiwan University Alumni Association held a ""camp"" on October 5-6, 2019. activity. (10/05) On the morning of Saturday, under the welcoming of the fresh air of Sujiawu, nearly 80 alumni from Taichung came to the camping area of Baiduo! The road is rugged, and the boat and the boat can't resist the excitement of the old classmates. The hot summer has activated everyone's enthusiasm. After stepping into the society and being weathered, everyone can be free and unrestrained, and say hello to each other. Tan Tian said that he was plunged into the joy of the memories of the year. Java Island is one of the world's most densely populated islands. It extends from Jakarta to the Sujiawumei coast of West Java, about 150 kilometers away, and it takes more than four hours. On the same day, we also caught up with the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism. Sujiawumei Guongong Lake is the longest suspension bridge in Southeast Asia. It was officially opened in March 2019. The bridge is about 250 meters long and about 2 meters wide. It is 150 meters from the ground and the maximum weight of the suspension bridge is 55 tons. The Guongong Lake Suspension Bridge is located in the scenic Guongnong Lake Tourist Park in Indonesia. The suspension bridge is open from 7:30 to 17:30 every day and the fare is 50,000 rupiah. To ensure safety, the park management allows up to 40 people to board at the same time. It takes at least an hour for the tourist to walk from the valley to the other side before the suspension bridge is opened. It only takes 15 minutes. The opening of the suspension bridge has a positive effect on increasing the number of domestic and foreign tourists in the Guongnong Lake Tourism Park. The Guongong Lake Suspension Bridge is located in an artificial lake in the tropical rain forest. It is usually filled with mist, and it is like a beautiful ink painting under the oblique sunlight. In addition to the Guongong Lake Suspension Bridge, there are also attractions such as the Saville Falls nearby, attracting thousands of domestic and foreign tourists every year. In the evening, the cold wind is blowing, but the rain is dripping, but everyone’s enthusiasm is not poured out. In the busy life, you have to relax and meet with your classmates to see the white clouds and blue sky, count the stars and watch the moon and breathe the fresh air. In the cold night, everyone wrapped themselves in a coat and talked about the old at the campfire, singing aloud in a loud voice, a descendant of the dragon, a childhood, a girl from Alishan, a moon representing my heart, and so on. On the top of my heart, the extraordinarily relaxed atmosphere also caused constant laughter. Especially at the time of the lucky draw, everyone looked forward to the winner of the first prize for the return ticket of Huahang Jakarta Taipei. The wonderful program is a train full of joys and joys. The passengers are brainstorming in the carriage, carrying out various fun and interesting activities to drive the journey of the next life. The most enjoyable thing about learning is to remember the memories of youth that have been told how many times they are not tired. In the days of youth, we are fascinated by the splendid future, looking forward to the infinite possibilities of the future, but there are also many questions, complicated interpersonal relationships, so that everyone has endless topics, and the night is deep. There are more exciting programs waiting for us tomorrow! In the early morning, the mist is filled, the sunrise on the lake is not dazzling, the suspension bridge on the lake is faintly visible, and the cold wind in the morning is like a sharp blade urging us to rush to the suspension bridge before the sun rises. Take a ""group video."" In the video, everyone's footsteps are light, the young and the old are happy, the mood is comfortable, and there is indeed the effect of rejuvenation. At the beginning of a good dream, waking up sleepy is not accompanied by the mountain wind blowing, shaking the undulating bridge surface, stunned, and steadily stepping on the footsteps, but can not help not heartbeat, cold hands and feet, but fortunately, everyone holding hands shoulder to shoulder Passing through this stimulating test also challenges people to limit themselves. (Li Shangyin’s sentence is tragic and incompatible with this atmosphere and cannot be used). Self-contained landscape and think of Li Shangyin's ""Jin Se"" ""This situation can be reminiscent, but it was already at a loss."" The sun rose from the horizon, illuminating the earth, the sun was full, the sky began to light up, the fragrant breakfast The scent of the scent is coming, and everyone enjoys it. Free time is up, some go to the waterfall to absorb positive energy, deep breathe Fendo fine, and some continue to share the unfinished story, unconsciously arrived in the afternoon, the students experienced the physical and mental washing in the camp, intermittent snoring accompanied by crisp The high voice of the forest birds, holding us to protect the original heart, we bring their own energy light, colliding with new sparks, not only to condense old friends, but also to make new friends and develop endless new ideas. The alumni association should be able to play the role of rest and harmony, and the spirit of mutual benefit. Not only that, but eating, drinking, and gathering together to do something meaningful, we have gathered the power of everyone to create a better future. The alumni of the National Taiwan University of Taiwan hope to create an open atmosphere. No matter where they come from, the background can feel the same warmth, no heart, no contest. In the afterglow of the sun in the afternoon, everyone harvested with full spirit and set foot on their way home. (Report of the Taiwan University Alumni Association Wenxuan Group)
