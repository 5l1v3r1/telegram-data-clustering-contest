女星許瑋甯近日接受時尚雜誌專訪，談到自己曾經因為拍戲角色極端關係，讓自己身心靈面臨崩潰，體重掉至44公斤，一度不願再拍戲，直喊：「太痛苦、太撕裂了！」
女星許瑋甯近日接受時尚雜誌《VOGUE》專訪，過去在校成績一向不錯的她坦言出社會後一開始面對別人的負面批評相當感到挫折，但自認耐力奇佳的她認為「你把我放在越高壓的環境下，我就會長得越快越好，說起來，這應該也算是一種被虐性格吧。」但也坦言因此脾氣會相對的差，倒霉的就是她的家人，「這點，很不好」

許瑋甯入行14來戲一部一部接，有空就休息去旅遊，但她也曾經遇到痛苦的時刻，她透露去年底同時接到兩部戲一部喜劇，一部是截然不同的人格，讓她人格錯亂、元氣大傷，半年的時間下來，她瘦到只剩44公斤，甚至一度覺得「我不愛表演了，我不想再做這個工作了，因為太痛苦、太撕裂了。」
在這痛苦的當下，許瑋甯想要放棄這一切去唸書，但每當找到學校時又會接到自己喜歡的角色。於是乎休息三個多月之後，許瑋甯又開始拍戲了，這是她感覺自己的疲憊狀態一點一點的被治癒了，才發現原來自己只是「累了」。

Actress Xu Yining recently accepted an exclusive interview with fashion magazines. She talked about her extreme relationship with the filming role, causing her body and mind to face collapse and losing weight to 44 kilograms. She once refused to film again and shouted: ""Too painful, too tearful!"" ""
Actress Xu Yining recently accepted an exclusive interview with the fashion magazine ""VOGUE"". In the past, her performance in the school has always been good. She frankly said that she was quite frustrated when she faced the negative criticism of others at the beginning of the society, but she believed that ""they put me in the endurance."" In the higher pressure environment, I will grow as fast as possible. Speaking of it, this should be considered a kind of abused character."" But also frankly, the temper will be relatively poor, and the unfortunate one is her family. ""This is very not good""


Xu Yining once wanted to leave the entertainment circle. (Reversal from Xu Yining's Facebook)

Xu Yining entered the line 14 to play one after another. She took a break to travel when she was free, but she also encountered painful moments. She revealed that she received two dramas at the end of last year, one of which was a completely different personality. She was so upset and badly hurt. After half a year, she lost only 44 kilograms. She even felt ""I don't like performances. I don't want to do this work anymore because it is too painful and too tearing.""
In this painful moment, Xu Yining wants to give up all this to study, but when he finds a school, he will receive his favorite character. After more than three months of rest, Xu Yining began to film again. This is because she felt that her exhausted state was cured little by little, only to find that she was just ""tired.""
