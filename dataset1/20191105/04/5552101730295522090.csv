以下為郭辦聲明：


我相信我熱愛的中華民國，這個自由民主的國度，沒有人該為彼此的立場不同，遭受辱罵。如果藍、綠執政，都只是坐視不管，無法有效終止網路霸凌，那我要如何讓我的支持者，去支持兩黨推出的候選人呢？


今天，我決定站出來，向這些扭曲邪惡的網路言論、向這些躲在鍵盤後面，用偏激不實假消息，挑動社會對立的人宣戰。每個人都有免於恐懼的自由，我再也無法忍受少數人因為政治立場，撕裂社會，傷害台灣的真善美，我也呼籲，和我一樣身受其害的朋友們勇敢站出來，糾正錯誤，終結霸凌。

The following is a statement by Guo:


I believe that the Republic of China, which I love, is a free and democratic country. No one should be insulted for each other’s different positions. If blue and green are in power, they just sit back and ignore the Internet bullying. How can I let my supporters support the candidates elected by the two parties?


Today, I decided to stand up and talk to these distorted evil Internet speeches, hide behind the keyboard, and use the false news to provoke the people of the society to declare war. Everyone has freedom from fear. I can no longer bear the fact that a few people have torn the society and hurt Taiwan’s truth, goodness and beauty because of their political stance. I also appeal to friends who have suffered like me to bravely stand up and correct mistakes. End the bullying.
