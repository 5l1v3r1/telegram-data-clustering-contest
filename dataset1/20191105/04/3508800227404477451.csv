05 Nov 2019, 04:31 by 關鍵評論網 ASEAN：馬六甲


我們想讓你知道的是區域全面經濟夥伴協定（RCEP）15個成員國4日宣布完成20個章節和市場准入的談判，準備在2020年簽署，由於印度認為協定內容沒有回應印度的憂慮而不願加入。



（中央社）經過7年談判，區域全面經濟夥伴協定（RCEP）15個成員國4日宣布完成20個章節和市場准入的談判，準備在2020年簽署，印度認為協定內容沒有回應印度的憂慮而不願加入。
第35屆東南亞國家協會高峰會（ASEAN Summit）及相關會議11月2日到4日在曼谷北郊的IMPACT展覽中心登場。4日下午登場的是備受矚目的第三屆RCEP高峰會，高峰會的成員包括東協10國以及6個貿易對話夥伴國中國、日本、南韓、印度、澳洲和紐西蘭的領導人。
高峰會結束後16國領導人發布共同聲明指出，在面對快速變化的全球環境時，RCEP談判完成代表大家對於開放貿易和投資環境的承諾，RCEP可以促進區域的未來發展榮景，並對全球經濟有正面貢獻，RCEP可以成為多邊貿易體系的支柱。
聲明中指出，15個RCEP參與國已經完成20個章節以及所有市場准入的談判，準備在2020年簽署。聲明也提到，印度有重大且沒被解決的問題，所有的RCEP成員國會一起解決這些問題，印度最後的決定會取決於這些問題的解決方式。
RCEP從2012年宣布開始談判，泰國副總理兼商業部長朱林（Jurin Laksanawisit）曾在10月上旬的RCEP部長級會議後表示，RCEP的20個章節已經完成14個，期望可以在11月的東協峰會中完成談判。
但RCEP遭遇來自印度國內的反彈，不少印度人擔心加入RCEP後，將有大量低價的中國商品進入印度市場，還有來自紐西蘭及澳洲的便宜乳製品，會擴大原就已經很大的貿易逆差。
印度媒體今日印度（India Today）報導引述不具名的印度政府人士指出，印度決定不加入RCEP是因為總理莫迪（Narendra Modi）認為，印度的憂慮並沒有在RCEP中彰顯出來。不具名的人士表示，RCEP沒有反映出它原有的目的，而結果並不公平也不平衡。
不具名人士也透露，中國在4日的RCEP高峰會中積極推動簽署RCEP，目的在於抗衡美中貿易戰，不過印度堅持不簽署。

RCEP的源起
中央社報導，已完成RCEP談判的國家包含東南亞國家協會（ASEAN）10個會員國（汶萊、柬埔寨、印尼、寮國、馬來西亞、緬甸、菲律賓、新加坡、泰國、越南）及6個自貿協議夥伴（印度、中國、日本、南韓、澳洲與紐西蘭），其中印度已表態不加入。
RCEP的目標是移除貿易壁壘，改善區內企業的市場交易管道，創造單一整合市場，方便成員國之間進行貿易。而RCEP意圖含括許多經濟層面，例如貨品交易、服務、投資、經濟與技術合作、智慧財產權、原產地規則、競爭與爭端解決等等議題。
RCEP緣起於2011年11月，當時東協在第19屆高峰會上通過「東協區域全面經濟夥伴架構協議」，邀請中國等6個自貿協議夥伴參與，接著各國領袖在2012年11月的第21屆東協高峰會上宣布談判開始。隔年5月，由東協經濟部長會議決議成立的「貿易談判委員會」（TNC）舉行第一回合談判。雖然RCEP由東協10國發起，且強調由東協10國主導，但一般認為中國才是背後主導者。
2019年11月在曼谷舉行的第35屆東協高峰會上，由於印度因關稅、與他國貿易赤字和非關稅壁壘等方面的歧見，並未同意協定，因此決定不加入。中央社報導，若印度終究決定加入，RCEP將成為全球最大自由貿易區，預估經濟規模將占全球年生產總值32.30%，約為27兆美元，涵括人口約占全球一半。

Not willing to join.



(Central News Agency) After seven years of negotiations, the 15 member states of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) announced on the 4th that they will complete negotiations on 20 chapters and market access, and are ready to sign in 2020.

The Central News Agency reported that countries that have completed RCEP negotiations include 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) and six free trade agreement partners. (India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand), of which India has stated that it does not join.
The goal of the RCEP is to remove trade barriers, improve the market trading channels of companies in the region, create a single integrated market, and facilitate trade between member states. The RCEP is intended to cover many economic aspects, such as goods trading, services, investment, economic and technical cooperation, intellectual property rights, rules of origin, competition and dispute resolution.
The RCEP originated in November 2011, when the ASEAN adopted the ASEAN Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement at the 19th Summit and invited six free trade agreement partners, including China, in November 2012. The negotiations began at the 21st ASEAN Summit. In May of the following year, the Trade Negotiation Committee (TNC), which was established by the ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting, held the first round of negotiations. Although the RCEP was initiated by the 10 ASEAN countries and emphasized by the 10 ASEAN countries, it is generally believed that China is the dominant player.
At the 35th ASEAN Summit held in Bangkok in November 2019, India decided not to join because of differences in tariffs, trade deficits with other countries and non-tariff barriers. The Central News Agency reported that if India decides to join, RCEP will become the world's largest free trade zone. The estimated economic scale will account for 32.30% of the global GDP, about 27 trillion US dollars, including about half of the world's population.
