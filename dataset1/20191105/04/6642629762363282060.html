      <p>The Hong Kong government said on Tuesday it deeply regrets the involvement of civil servants in protests that have plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades as activists plan fresh demonstrations across the territory.</p>
      <p>Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung's comments came after commentary by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a> civil servants who supported the anti-government demonstrations would "perish with the rioters".</p>
      <p>"In the past few months, a very small portion of the civil servants have broken the law, participating in illegal protests. We deeply regret that," Cheung said.</p>
      <p>"I think citizens have expectations to our colleagues. Their first job is to serve society, serve the community. And to support government policies, that is the responsibility of the civil servants."</p>

      <p>The demonstrations began over a since-scrapped extradition bill and escalated in mid-June.</p>
      <p>Protesters have kept up their calls for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police behaviour, among other demands.</p>
      <p>The protests, which pose a grave challenge to Chinese leader <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/xi-jinping.html">Xi Jinping</a>, have received broad support from Hong Kong people, including some civil servants - one of whom was arrested on October 31 for illegal assembly - teachers and financial sector workers who have at times taken to the streets.</p>
      <p>In August, thousands of civil servants defied a government warning to remain politically neutral and joined a rally, while embattled leader Carrie Lam said in September she regretted the arrest of some civil servants during protests.</p>

      <p>While the number of people who take part in the mostly weekend rallies has dwindled from the millions who participated in June, the violence and vandalism have escalated.</p>
      <p>Authorities have refused permits for many recent protests, making them illegal from the outset and activists liable to be arrested.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Lam received strong backing from Beijing, with Chinese President Xi Jinping saying he has a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/china-xi-reiterates-support-embattled-hk-leader-carrie-lam-191104190754544.html">high degree of confidence</a> in her leadership. </p>
      <h3>'Police brutality'</h3>
      <p>Cheung said his administration would cherish and safeguard freedom of the press amid mounting criticism of what many see as excessive police force, including against the media.</p>
      <p>Officers have said they have shown restraint in the face of escalating violence. Police cancelled a planned news conference on Monday after several journalists from the public broadcaster and other local media turned up wearing helmets with signs that read "investigate police brutality".</p>
      <p>Cheung is standing in for beleaguered Lam, who is visiting mainland China, where President Xi Jinping said on Monday the central government had a high degree of confidence in her.</p>
      <p>Protesters have circulated plans on social media to mark Guy Fawkes Day on Tuesday by wearing the white, smiling Guy Fawkes masks made popular by anti-establishment hackers, the film "V for Vendetta" and protesters globally.</p>
      <p>Beijing-backed Lam banned face masks last month, invoking colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years, but protesters have largely ignored the ruling.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations have battered the retail and tourism sectors, with preliminary government data showing the economy slid into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>An IHS Markit survey published on Tuesday showed business activity in Hong Kong's private sector fell to its weakest in 21 years in October, weighed down by anti-government protests and softening global demand.</p>
