[Zhongxin.com] On the 4th, local time, South Korean President Wen Zai, who is visiting Thailand, attended the ASEAN-related summit meeting and held 11-minute separate talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who attended the meeting. Qinghuatai spokesman Gao Yuting said on the 4th that the heads of the two countries had an 11-minute separate conversation between 8:35 and 8:46 local time. The report said that this was the first time that the heads of the two countries had a face-to-face substantive dialogue after the forced labor dispute and Japan’s restrictions on trade with South Korea and the relationship between South Korea and Japan began to deteriorate. Gao Yuting said that Wen Zai and Abe had talked in a very friendly and sincere atmosphere. The two heads of state agreed that the ROK-Japan relationship is very important and reconfirmed the unresolved issues between the two countries and should be resolved through dialogue. During the talks, the two leaders expressed their hope that through the recent consultations conducted by the official channels of the two foreign ministries, they will come up with a substantive relationship plan. In addition, Wen Zai also proposed that “the plan for a higher level of consultation will be discussed if necessary”. In this regard, Abe also said: ""By all possible means, work together to find a solution.""
