      <h2>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has overhauled his diet in a bid to address his 'weight issues' and has been overwhelmed by the feedback</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T04:05:19+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Rob Kardashian has shed more than 20lbs and is loving the reaction to his new slimmed down figure.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians has been keeping a low profile of late, so fans of the reality star were stunned when he shared a rare pic of himself last week.</p>
      <p>Fans of the Kardashians were praiseworthy of his efforts and this has reportedly given him a huge boost in his self-confidence.</p>
      <p>A source has told Hollywood Life: "Rob loves the reaction [he gets] from everyone – from family and friends. It’s only making him feel better and better all around.”</p>
      <p>The reaction to his slimmer frame has led to Rob wanting to up his public profile and he allegedly "wants to start being out more and more."</p>

      <p>There is sad news for fans of the Kardashians' reality show though, as it seems that Rob is not going to be heading back to KUWTK any time soon.</p>
      <p>The source continued to say that while Rob "will not exactly be seen partying,” but "he actually wants to be out there more now because he wants to live his life."</p>
      <p>Rob has apparently embraced his new look and "he’s much more confident now that he looks and feels so much better."</p>

      <p>One fan commented: "Looking real good, Rob."</p>
      <p>Another praised him, writing: "Good job on the weight loss Rob. I know the battle. God bless."</p>
