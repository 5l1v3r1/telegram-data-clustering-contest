      <h1>Wait, Is This Keanu Reeves’s Girlfriend?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T04:13:20+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 04:13</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Lodi</a></address>
      <p>Sorry to us all, but <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/keanu-reeves-responds-to-the-internets-love-for-him.html">Keanu Reeves</a> may be taken. He recently attended LACMA’s Art + Film Gala, holding the hand of an artist named Alexandra Grant. Is this his special somebody, or is he just being <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/keanu-reeves-youre-breathtaking-sign.html">lovingly affectionate</a> toward one of his friends?</p>
      <p>I haven’t heard back from my private investigator yet, but one thing is certain: Reeves and Grant have known each other for quite some time. In 2011, the two teamed up for their first project, a book called <i>Ode to Happiness</i> that was written by Reeves and illustrated by Grant. According to an article from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/15/keanu-reeves-ode-to-happiness"><i>Guardian</i></a><i> </i>during that time, the book came about by accident, starting from some fake, “self-pity” poetry Reeves jokingly wrote for his friend, Janey Bergam:</p>
      <blockquote>Bergam passed Reeves’s words to Grant without his knowledge. Grant created the images and made them into a book, which she presented to Reeves, hidden inside the pages of a large, green 1970s travel book called <i>The British Scene</i>. “It was a surprise,” says Grant, “and a private gift. We didn’t make the book to publish it; it was meant to put a big smile on our faces and make everyone laugh. Then someone said, ‘I want five copies,’ and that’s when the lightbulb went on.”</blockquote>
      <p>Reeves and Grant also<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/t-magazine/keanu-reeves-art-book-publishing.html"> launched a small press</a> together called X Artists’ Books in 2017. If you take a gander at (or, ahem, do a deep lurk of) Grant’s Instagram, there is evidence of Reeves scattered about. Like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCHFr_VBAGv/">this photo from a book signing</a> for their second project, <i>Shadows</i>, which consists of photographs that Grant took of Reeves’s shadows during the filming of <i>John Wick</i>. There’s also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BbdqPloBmOh/">this photo</a> of them at a reading from her book, <i>The Artist’s Prison</i>, along with a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNJO_AkAAeE/">photoshoot </a>of the two of them from <i>Vogue Spain</i>. And then there’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCDeU6mBAIU/">this one</a> where they are lovingly gazing into each others’ eyes … but again, it could be totally platonic. Haven’t we <i>all</i> looked into our friend’s eyeballs once or twice?</p>
      <p>But <i>if</i> Keanu Reeves is indeed dating this nice-looking lady, congrats to them. (And their many creative collaborations, which, sure sound like a recipe for horniness to me!) The internet’s boyfriend is<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/keanu-reeves-is-lonely-oh-no.html"> a lonely guy no more</a>.</p>
