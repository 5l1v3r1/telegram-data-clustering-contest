“We’ve both been through a lot—I think it’s just knowing that we’re going to be there. Whether we agree or disagree, we are always going to have each other’s back through anything,” Hannah said. Hannah also added that she is “so proud” of Demi for “being honest and making choices that are right for her at this time. I can’t wait to see what’s next for her.”
Demi announced the breakup on her Instagram last week and wrote that she and Kristian “want what is best for us in the long run and for us right now, that means being apart and growing individually.” According to an E! News source, distance was allegedly the reason why Demi and Kristian broke up in the first place.



“They were supposed to permanently move in together in L.A., and that never happened,” the source said. “They really haven’t spent much time together in the same place since getting back from Paradise, and it made them rethink the whole situation. They grew apart, and once they came down from the post-vacation high, they realized they were rushing their relationship.”
Since Demi and Kristian broke up, Demi has been trying to live her best life. She attended last night’s episode of Dancing With the Stars to support Hannah (like she has been every single week) and posted a cheeky pic of her Halloween costume. Kristian, on the other hand, has remained pretty silent.
