評韓國瑜「故宮一次展」：攤開你的藏品，讓我看看你，玄之又玄的秘密
05 Nov 2019, 04:00 by TNL特稿


我們想讓你知道的是韓國瑜發表的「故宮一次展」引發各界討論，然而，博物館吸引觀光客的重點，應該不是「量」的問題，「質」才是關鍵，展覽要能創造與觀眾的關係才是正解，各國的博物館也早就針對這點下苦心了。



文：刀子髒
國民黨總統參選人、高雄市長韓國瑜10月20日於台南提出觀光政策，指出故宮展出僅有九分之一，還有九分之八在山洞裡，全部看完要花上30年，韓喊話：「假設台灣觀光產業突然打開，將故宮文物一次展出，會不會轟動全世界？」如果故宮70萬件展品一次展出，會不會轟動全世界，答案絕對是肯定的！因為沒有人做過，沒有人（和文物）會這樣不惜粉身碎骨。
而後張善政提及是數位化的意思，這也引起全台的各方論戰。不管是「故宮系」網友還是守備範圍極廣的名嘴們。一句話不但引起了博物館數位化、實體擴建之亂，也引起了謝震武、謝祖武之亂。但如果是數位化的意思，原文中「展」的定義便需要好好來討論。蔡英文總統則是回應「好的典藏，需要好的策展，策展不是扮家家酒，政治也不該只剩信口開河。」而在立院質詢時，文化部部長和史博館館長、國美館館長的回應提到了關鍵字「安全」、「策展」。


民進黨立委黃國書23日在立法院教育及文化委員會質詢 說，有總統候選人認為故宮文物應一次攤開展出，並問 國美館長林志明（後左3）、史博館長廖新田（後左2） 是否適宜。2名館長皆表示，不可能也不適宜。圖後左 為文化部長鄭麗君。Photo Credit: 中央社

故宮的存在，一直都是政治的問題。故宮南院當初的設立也是政治的問題。 故宮每年為台灣促進多少觀光人數以及故宮南院低迷的參觀人數也一直是目前待解的問題。而這次在選前，候選人於促進觀光議題中想到故宮，也算是難得被提及的文化議題。不過這樣ㄧ開金口，也讓各地開始盤點故宮的所作所為，對於文化議題上電視被討論也算是好事一樁。
很多人一定都覺得認真就輸了，或是丟下一句「不可能」便覺得結案、上一頁或往左滑。但我想針對一些概念和趨勢去做討論。
「攤開你的藏品 讓我看看你 玄之又玄的秘密」
先排除實體一次展出的原因是為了什麼，就保護文物的觀點就是絕對不可行。再針對當初希望促進觀光的原因，彷彿還停留在數百年前博物館作為陳列室的概念，以為只要將藏品全部陳列出來就能夠吸引大眾來嗎？
如果真是這樣也未必太玄了吧。博物館早就已經典範轉移，從「物」轉移到以「人」為中心。如果再接回希望促進觀光的脈絡，觀光客會花多少時間看展覽呢？人們會花一天以上在迪士尼玩樂，但我想一般觀光客很難以此標準安排行程在博物館上，能夠和翠玉白菜、肉形石和毛公鼎拍照打卡，再加上故宮三寶范寬《谿山行旅圖》、郭熙《早春圖》和李唐《萬壑松風圖》，我想到此博物館腳（museum feet）症狀出現也就不虛此行了。
博物館吸引觀光客的重點，應該不是「量」的問題，「質」才是關鍵。所以一次展是「數位」或是「實體」也不是那麼重要了。如何讓人潮回流，除了「質」以外，創造與觀眾的關係才是正解。
越來越瘋狂的世界，博物館的新定義和新方向為何？
到底什麼是博物館呢？世界運轉的速度越來越快，越來越瘋狂。目前國際博物館協會（International Council of Museums，簡稱ICOM）於2007年提出的定義[1]似乎醞釀著改變，原本ICOM預計要在2019年9月3年一度的全球大會中表決新定義，其中提到了「博物館是一個讓過去和未來進行關鍵對話的空間，具有民主性、包容性和多音性…」，可見促進對話的重要性，但新定義中部分被提及的文字及概念卻也因為各國意見分歧而延期表決。
從世界各地知名文物類及藝術類博物館可以觀察出，線上活動越來越重要，如何讓全球觀眾可以共享參與，創造互動是必須的，如紐約大都會藝術博物館（The Museum of Modern Art, MOMA）的IG帳號有479萬人次追蹤，「The Museum at FIT」有自己的broadcast節目，社群媒體的經營成為許多人接觸博物館的入口。

除此之外，「策展」也逐漸被重視，甚至成為了一門學科，如何透過研究在眾多的展品中挑選出適合展出的並能夠回應現代社會問題是非常專業的。2018年MOMA以宗教和時尚議題策展的《天賜美體：時尚與天主教意象》創下該館史上最高的1,659,647參展人數紀錄，同時也奪得該年度最多人參觀的殊榮。可以從MOMA的經營看出如何成功整合線上和線下成為關鍵因素。
如何不讓Digital只是低著頭？「沈浸式體驗」跟升旗台一樣是一定要的
「數位化」這個概念從每個人都低著頭可以知道已經非常普遍，畢竟已經談了幾十年了。其實故宮已經做了很多數位化的工作，從APP開發、動畫、數位展等。現任故宮院長吳密察表示「數位典藏是指把文物一張一張的拍照起來，不見得叫做數位展覽，目前故宮的數位典藏已經做到文物總數的26.5%，其中書畫類已完成95%、器物類已完成85%、圖書文獻已完成到18%。」可以想見「線上瀏覽」跟「線上展覽」的概念大該跟「謝祖武」、「謝震武」一樣難分。如果只是數位檔案的瀏覽，我想是很難將線上人潮導入博物館的。

博物館要如何發揮出升旗台的功能讓大家抬頭並且親臨現場呢？可以肯定的是參觀博物館的五感體驗對是無法取代的，藝術品的靈光也是，當然這也都是陳年八股的論戰。就目前博物館的趨勢，我想「沈浸式體驗」是可以思考的方向。日本東京的台場摩天輪旁的teamLab Borderless 2018年開幕造成狂潮，從預約購票到掃描QRcode入場，無邊界投影及科技藝術的互動設計都讓人目眩神迷，吸引全球觀光客前往朝聖。
除此之外，其實博物館就是個社交場所，重要的是在這個場合所遇到的人、事、物，我還記得電影《真愛每一天》男主角為了巧遇女主角，在展場等了好幾天才遇到，而現在有了博物館的交友軟體「Muzing」出現，可以透過APP認識同樣的愛好者。我想這樣也將博物館與戀愛摩天輪的產業鏈給接上了。

解決方案讓各位久等了，這不是來了嗎？
其實說了這麼多，還是得端出解決方案，不要只是信口開河。我會覺得當初提出「故宮一次展」的概念實在太勞師動眾，也太沒效率了，等到真的發生都不知道是第幾任總統選舉了。如果要來一劑選前猛藥，我有個大膽的想法，不妨提出邀請Beyonce、Jay Z夫妻來台灣為故宮拍攝MV，相信也可以像是”〈Apeshit〉這首歌為羅浮宮帶來的效益一樣，轟動全世界。但，阿諾的新片《魔鬼終結者：黑暗宿命》都要上映了，好像也還沒來台灣就是了。

Comment on South Korea’s ""After the Palace Museum"": Spread your collection, let me see you, the secret of mysterious and mysterious
05 Nov 2019, 04:00 by TNL Feature


What we want you to know is that the ""After Exhibition of the Forbidden City"" published by Korea Yu has sparked discussion. However, the focus of the museum to attract tourists is not the question of ""quantity"". The ""quality"" is the key. The exhibition should be able to create and audience. The relationship is the correct solution, and the museums of various countries have long been painstakingly focused on this point.



Text: Knife dirty
KMT’s presidential candidate, Kaohsiung Mayor, South Korea, proposed a tourism policy in Tainan on October 20, pointing out that only one-ninth of the National Palace Museum’s exhibition, and eight-eighths of it’s in the cave, will take 30 years to complete. Han shouted: ""Assuming that the tourism industry in Taiwan suddenly opens up and exhibits the cultural relics of the Forbidden City once, will it be sensational to the whole world?"" If the 700,000 exhibits of the Forbidden City are exhibited once, will it be a sensation in the world, the answer is absolutely certain! Because no one has done it, no one (and cultural relics) will do so at all.
Later, Zhang Shanzheng’s reference was digital, which also caused all parties in Taiwan to debate. Whether it is the ""Forbidden City"" netizens or the garrison of a wide range of mouths. One sentence not only caused the chaos of the museum's digitalization and physical expansion, but also caused the chaos of Xie Zhenwu and Xie Zuwu. But if it is digital, the definition of ""exhibition"" in the original text needs to be discussed. President Tsai Ing-wen responded to ""good collections, which require good curatorial curricula. Curation is not to play a family wine, politics should not be left with a mouthful of mouth."" In the question of the Liyuan, the Minister of Culture and the curator of the Shibo Museum, Gome The director's response mentioned the keywords ""safety"" and ""curing"".


On the 23rd, the DPP legislator Huang Guoshu questioned the Legislative Yuan Education and Culture Committee that a presidential candidate believed that the cultural relics of the National Palace Museum should be spread out once, and asked the National Museum Director Lin Zhiming (lat. 3) and Shibo Director Liao Xintian (lat. 2) Is it appropriate? The two curators said that it is impossible or inappropriate. The left is the Minister of Culture, Zheng Lijun. Photo Credit: Central News Agency

The existence of the Forbidden City has always been a political issue. The establishment of the South Palace of the Forbidden City was also a political issue. The number of tourists who promoted the number of tourists in Taiwan every year and the downturn in the South Palace of the Forbidden City has also been a problem to be solved. Before the election, the candidate’s thought of the Forbidden City in promoting tourism issues is also a rare cultural issue. However, opening the gold mouth in this way also allowed the localities to take stock of the actions of the Forbidden City. It is also a good thing to discuss TV on cultural issues.
Many people must feel serious about losing, or throwing a ""impossible"" feeling that they will close the case, go to the previous page or slide to the left. But I want to discuss some concepts and trends.
""Expand your collection, let me see your mysterious secret.""
It is absolutely not feasible to exclude the idea that the entity is exhibited once and for the purpose of protecting the cultural relics. In view of the reason why I hope to promote sightseeing, it seems that I still stayed in the concept of a museum as a showroom hundreds of years ago. I thought that it would be able to attract the public as long as the collections were all displayed.
If this is the case, it may not be too mysterious. The museum has long been a classic paradigm shift, moving from ""things"" to ""people"". If you take back the hope of promoting tourism, how much time will visitors spend watching the exhibition? People will spend more than a day playing in Disney, but I think it is difficult for general tourists to arrange trips in the museum according to this standard. They can take photos with jade cabbage, meat-shaped stone and Mao Gongding, plus the Forbidden City Sanbao Fankuan ""Xishan Travel Map"" Guo Xi, ""Early Spring Picture"" and Li Tang ""Wan Yu Song Feng Tu"", I think that the symptoms of the museum feet (museum feet) will be worthwhile.
The focus of the museum to attract tourists is not the question of ""quantity"", but ""quality"" is the key. Therefore, it is not so important that an exhibition is ""digital"" or ""entity"". How to make people tide back, in addition to ""quality"", creating a relationship with the audience is the correct solution.
What is the new definition and direction of the museum in an increasingly crazy world?
What is a museum? The world is moving faster and faster. At present, the definition proposed by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in 2007 [1] seems to be brewing changes. ICOM is expected to vote on the new definition at the September 3rd global conference in 2019, which mentions ""The museum is a space for a key dialogue between the past and the future. It is democratic, inclusive and multi-sounding..."", which shows the importance of promoting dialogue, but the words and concepts mentioned in the new definition are also due to countries. Disagreement and postponement of voting.
From the well-known cultural relics and art museums around the world, it can be observed that online activities are becoming more and more important. How to make participation and create interactions for global audiences is necessary, such as The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). The IG account has 4.79 million trackers. ""The Museum at FIT"" has its own broadcast program, and the operation of social media has become the entrance for many people to contact the museum.

In addition, ""Current"" has gradually been valued and even become a discipline. It is very professional to study the selection of suitable exhibits in many exhibits and to respond to modern social problems. In 2018, MOMA's ""Tianci Body: Fashion and Catholic Imagery"" curated by religious and fashion issues set the highest number of 1,659,647 exhibitors in the history of the museum, and also won the most people's visits of the year. It can be seen from MOMA's management how successful integration of online and offline is a key factor.
How to prevent Digital from just head down? ""Immersive experience"" is as important as the flag-raising platform.
The concept of ""digitalization"" can be known from everyone's head down. It has been talked about for decades. In fact, the Forbidden City has done a lot of digital work, from APP development, animation, digital exhibitions and so on. The current president of the Forbidden City, Wu Micha, said that ""digital collection refers to photographing cultural relics one by one. It is not necessarily called a digital exhibition. At present, the digital collection of the Forbidden City has achieved 26.5% of the total number of cultural relics, of which 95% have been completed. The instrument category has been completed 85%, and the book literature has been completed to 18%."" It is conceivable that the concept of ""online browsing"" and ""online exhibition"" should be as difficult as ""Xie Zuwu"" and ""Xie Zhenwu"". If it is just a few files, I think it is very difficult to introduce online crowds into the museum.

How do museums play the role of the flag-raising platform for everyone to look up and visit the scene? What is certain is that the experience of visiting the museum's five senses is irreplaceable, and the aura of art is also, of course, this is also the debate of the eight-year old. As for the current trend of museums, I think the ""immersion experience"" is a direction that can be considered. The opening of teamLab Borderless in 2018 at the Odaiba Ferris wheel in Tokyo, Japan, created a frenzy. From booking tickets to scanning QRcode, the borderless projection and interactive design of technology and art are dazzling and attracting global tourists to the pilgrimage.
In addition, the museum is actually a social place. What is important is the people, things and things that are encountered on this occasion. I still remember the movie ""True Love Every Day"". The actor has waited for the heroine in the exhibition. The genius met, and now the museum's dating software ""Muzing"" appears, you can know the same fans through the APP. I think this will also connect the museum and the industrial chain of the love Ferris wheel.

The solution has kept you waiting, isn't this coming?
In fact, if you say so much, you still have to come up with a solution. Don't just open your mouth. I would think that the concept of ""the exhibition of the Forbidden City"" was too arrogant and too inefficient. I don't know if it happened to be the first presidential election. If you want to take a dose of pre-selected medicine, I have a bold idea. I would like to invite Beyonce and Jay Z to come to Taiwan to shoot MV for the Forbidden City. I believe it can be like the effect of the song ""Apeshit"" for the Louvre. The same, sensational to the world. However, Arnold's new film ""Devil Terminator: Dark Destiny"" will be released, as if it has not yet come to Taiwan.
