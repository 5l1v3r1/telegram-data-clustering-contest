      <p>Handing over control of Scotland’s drugs policy is essential if the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> is to support any minority government, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> said yesterday.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s First Minister has said powers over drug legislation will be a “key issue” of an post-election agreements, adding that, in the absence of Scottish independence, legal powers should be devolved to Holyrood.</p>
      <p>Her comments came after a report from the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster was released yesterday – <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/committee-backs-drugs-campaign-stop-20804960">following a Record campaign to update our drug laws</a>.</p>
      <p>Following a comprehensive inquiry into drugs misuse in Scotland, the committee recommended the possession of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs">drugs</a> for personal use be <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-set-back-decriminalisation-drugs-20533500">decriminalised</a>, as well as the institution of safer consumption facilities – one of which the Scottish Government has been attempting to create in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>.</p>
      <p>Drugs deaths claimed the lives of 1187 people in Scotland in 2018, leading several politicians to call for a more health-based approach to addiction.</p>

      <p>As she hit the campaign trail in Cambuslang, Sturgeon said: “I think there is a realisation that this is a public health emergency we face.</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government has powers and resources and it’s our responsibility to use those effectively.</p>
      <p>“But I think there’s a growing consensus that we could do more and be more effective if some of the powers currently held at Westminster were devolved here.</p>
      <p>“That will be a key issue in any post-election discussion, whatever the parliamentary arithmetic might be.”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said she did not want to commit herself to providing more funding for drugs treatment programmes in the next Scottish budget due to a delay to the Westminster Budget, meaning the amount of money in the block grant to Scotland would be unclear.</p>

      <p>She said: “I announced additional money for drug treatment services in the Programme for Government in September, which is important.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to get into details about a budget just now, because it would be inappropriate to do so.</p>
      <p>“However, the drugs emergency and the health service will always be at the forefront of any budget considerations of the Scottish Government.”</p>
