05 Nov 2019, 04:21

【罗盘报新闻网曼谷11月4日讯】我国总统佐科威(Jokowi)周一（11月4日）出席在泰国曼谷举行的东盟加三（APT）第22届峰会发表演讲时表示，东盟加三建立战略伙伴是区域合和平稳定的关键，并造福为区域人民的动力。佐科威说，面对全球政治变化莫测的格局，地缘政治和地缘经济的竞争日益加剧，如东盟加三的稳固性脆弱，区域的安全稳定与繁荣将受到威胁。1997年成立的东盟加三机制是指东盟10国(印度尼西亚、马来西亚、菲律宾、新加坡、文莱、泰国、越南、老挝、缅甸、柬埔寨)加上中国、日本、韩国3国。东盟加三首次领导人会议于1997年12月15日在马来西亚首都吉隆坡举行。东盟各国和中日韩3国领导人主要就21世纪东亚地区的前景、发展和合作等议题、深入地交换了意见，并取得了广泛共识。佐科威总统接着说，在应对灾害方面，东盟加三的团结也显示非常重要，因为东亚地区面临潜在的自然灾害的挑战。因此东盟与中日韩三国必须共同努力，携手合作，尤其是加强金融合作共同抵御自然灾害的风险，包括共同为自然灾害提供融资和保险。根据资料显示，2016年自然灾害造成区域经济损失甚至达到910亿美元。因此，佐科威非常赞赏南亚灾难风险保险基金（SEADRIF）对自然灾害重建工程风险融资的计划，并要求东盟加三国家对这项计划给予最大的支持和作出最大的贡献。佐科威还说，区域安全方面，传统和非传统的挑战也正在加剧。 为了应对这种变化多端的动态，佐科威提出了两个意见，即不断加强区域战略互信和团结一致应对自然灾害的影响。峰会结束，返回国之前，佐科威总统与日本首相安倍晋三和澳大利亚总理莫里森(Scott燤orrison)举行双边会谈。(v)

The 22nd ASEAN Plus Three Summit Bangkok Summit Zorkovy said ASEAN plus three strategic partners are the key to regional peace and stability

05 Nov 2019, 04:21

[Compass News Network, Bangkok, November 4th] Chinese President Jokowi (August 4th) attended a speech at the 22nd Summit of ASEAN Plus Three (APT) in Bangkok, Thailand, saying that ASEAN Plus Third, the establishment of strategic partners is the key to regional peace and stability, and benefits the people of the region. Zokoff said that in the face of unpredictable global political changes, geopolitical and geo-economic competition is intensifying. For example, the stability and fragility of ASEAN Plus III will threaten regional security, stability and prosperity. The ASEAN Plus three mechanism established in 1997 refers to 10 ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia) plus China, Japan and South Korea. The ASEAN Plus Three First Leaders Meeting was held on December 15, 1997 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The leaders of the ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea mainly exchanged views on issues such as the prospects, development and cooperation of the East Asian region in the 21st century, and reached broad consensus. President Zocco went on to say that in the response to disasters, the solidarity of ASEAN plus three also shows that it is very important because East Asia faces the challenge of potential natural disasters. Therefore, ASEAN and China, Japan and South Korea must work together and work together, especially to strengthen financial cooperation to jointly resist the risks of natural disasters, including jointly providing financing and insurance for natural disasters. According to the data, the regional economic losses caused by natural disasters in 2016 even reached $91 billion. Therefore, Zocco highly appreciates the South Asian Disaster Risk Insurance Fund (SEADRIF)'s plan for risk financing of natural disaster reconstruction projects, and requires ASEAN plus three countries to give the greatest support and make the greatest contribution to this plan. Zokwe also said that traditional and non-traditional challenges are also increasing in terms of regional security. In response to this dynamic change, Jokowi made two comments, namely, continuously strengthening regional strategic mutual trust and solidarity to cope with the impact of natural disasters. At the end of the summit, before returning to the country, President Zokwe held bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Scott 燤orrison. (v)
