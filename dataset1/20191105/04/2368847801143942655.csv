05 Nov 2019, 04:23

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】香港反送中運動持續多月以來，數千名示威者被抓捕，其中一些被捕者被撤銷控罪，但一出法院又被警方抓捕。據港媒報導，4日晚，有百餘名防暴警在東區法院外，把已經獲撤銷控罪的示威者帶上警車，再次抓捕。
11月5日，香港「星島日報」稱，4日晚19時開始，有過百名防暴警察在東區法院外進行戒備，等候獲撤銷控罪的被告離開法院，至晚20時，被告們獲釋走出法院後，再度被警員拉上警車抓捕。
香港東網消息也稱，大批防暴警察抵達東區法院外，有部分警察進入大樓地下。晚上20時，有3名被控男子在其同伴撐傘遮蔽下離開法院，被抓捕帶上警車。
據了解，警方較早前已經帶走另外兩人，他們當庭釋放後在法庭外再次被捕。

根據5名被告的控罪書描述，5人分別為21歲男子鄭錦輝、22歲女子楊泳茹、24歲男子丘建威、21歲莫禮滔和19歲黃建棋。
5人被控涉嫌在灣仔堅拿道西10號冠景樓4樓F室保管或控制爆炸品，其中包括59瓶汽油彈、79瓶半製成汽油彈以及伸縮警棍、胡椒噴霧、防毒面罩等物品。
11月4日，開庭後，辯方稱，控方呈交的律政司同意檢控書寫錯被告名，中英文控罪內容不同，「並非有效文件，根本無理據繼續檢控程序，應即時釋放所有被告」。
隨後，裁判官判定此錯誤導致整個聆訊無效，下令控方需要在下午18時前決定如何處理，在限期過後所有被告被當庭釋放。
但香港警方卻重新部署了對5人的再度拘捕行動。據悉，5人案件將儘快重新提訊。

香港反送中運動如今已經持續5個月，港府公布反送中運動百餘天以來的相關數字，政務司長張建宗表示，截至10月10上午，已有2379人被捕，當中104人是16歲以下，其中750人、超過3成是18歲以下。
進入11月，港警對示威者實施了更為血腥的鎮壓。僅在11月2日，香港警方就拘捕了逾200人，還打傷多人，其中僅送醫救治的就高達54人。
香港警方濫捕、濫暴、濫權不受監管的鎮壓示威者，備受國際輿論詬病。在中共「十一」大閱兵當天，港警開槍，及10月5日《禁蒙面法》推出後，港人的五大訴求已增加一條，即「解散警隊、刻不容緩」。
