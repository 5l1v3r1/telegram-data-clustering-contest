習面授林鄭「最重要任務」 公安部長隨行引猜測

05 Nov 2019, 04:35

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】中共四中全會後，香港事態並未緩和，相反更加嚴峻，港警創下日捕逾200人新記錄。特首林鄭月娥11月4日赴上海向習近平匯報工作，習對林鄭面授當前「最重要的任務」，二人會見時中共公安部部長趙克志也陪同在一旁，引發外界猜測。
11月4日晚，赴上海出席第二屆中國國際進口博覽會的香港特首林鄭，向習近平匯報香港的情況。中共黨媒《人民日報》報導說，習近平當面聽取了林鄭關於香港近期局勢的匯報，並給出新的指示。
報導稱，習近平肯定了林鄭的工作，同時，習再次提到「止暴制亂、恢復秩序」是香港當前最重要的任務，並要求林鄭「依法制止」和「懲治暴力活動」。
值得一提的是，陪同習近平會見林鄭的除了中央辦公廳主任丁薛祥、中共中央外事辦主任楊潔篪、外交部部長王毅，還有中共公安部部長趙克志。
《華爾街日報》原駐華記者王春翰在推特發文分析說，趙克志陪同習近平與林鄭會晤，這進一步表明，趙在香港事務中發揮了作用。
香港反送中抗爭自6月爆發以來，趙克志屢次南下廣東，並到派出所視察。9月，趙克志還曾陪同習近平接見澳門新任行政長官賀一誠，這是首次出現公安部長參加習的此類會議。
9月13日，有消息指趙克志正式加入成為港澳工作協調小組第5名副組長，顯示公安系統在涉港澳事務上將扮演更重要的角色。
目前，韓正出任港澳工作協調小組組長，負責中共對香港以及澳門事務的管理；而中共中央外事辦主任楊潔篪和外交部部長王毅一直掛名在該小組。
有分析稱，中共四中全會決定要「立即解決香港問題」，北京不會出兵，但港警會用紅色恐怖鎮壓抗爭市民。
11月2日，港人發起「求援國際、堅守自治」集會，港警鎮壓行動升級，集會剛剛開始就進行暴力驅散，當天共抓捕超過200人，其中包括3名區議員候選人。
早在8月中旬，香港《蘋果日報》披露未經證實的消息指，習近平在北戴河會議期間，下令對香港無需動用部隊，實施「嚴刑峻法」，盡快平亂。
消息還說，北京命令已由中聯辦控制的香港警隊，要「多抓人」並加重判刑。
文章指出，自從2014年雨傘運動後，中共公安部與安全部已經派駐上千人馬駐港，今年反送中運動中，又增派了一千多名懂粵語的公安武警，與香港警察一同鎮壓港人。
《蘋果日報》此前還報導，8月2日，中共政法委書記郭聲琨抵達深圳，針對香港「部署工作」，強化港警的暴力手段。郭聲琨被指曾慶紅外甥，也是香港警隊在中共體制內的「最高指揮官」。
在反送中運動期間，示威者被打傷、打殘、甚至被打死的傳聞不斷，還有示威者披露遭到警察性暴力，更有人遭到多名警察性侵。民眾質疑，下手狠毒的所謂「香港警察」，很可能是混入港警隊伍的中共大陸武警和公安。
香港浸會大學教授高敬文此前引述消息指，北京已從廣東附近地區向香港調派了大約2千名熟悉粵語的大陸警察，而且還不斷有人員赴港。
有評論說，香港人僅僅是為了爭取基本法中賦予的民主選舉權力，就遭到了中共無所不用其極的鎮壓。港警雞姦、強姦示威者傳聞不斷，白衣人、黑社會砍人事件屢屢發生，日前又爆出暴徒咬斷議員耳朵的慘案，令香港人越來越看到了中共的殘暴無度。

Xi’s face-to-face interview with Lin Zheng was the most important task. When the two met, Zhao Kezhi, the Minister of Public Security of the Communist Party of China, accompanied him and triggered speculation.
On the evening of November 4th, Lin Zheng, the Hong Kong chief executive who attended the 2nd China International Import Expo, reported to Hong Kong about Xi Jinping.

Guo Shengyu was accused of Zeng Qing’s infrared squad and was the ""highest commander"" of the Hong Kong Police Force within the CCP system.
During the anti-delivery campaign, there were rumors of protesters being wounded, disabled, and even killed. There were also protesters who disclosed sexual violence by the police and more people were sexually assaulted by several police officers. The public has questioned that the so-called ""Hong Kong Police"" who started to fight drugs is likely to be the Chinese armed police and public security police who are mixed into the Hong Kong police force.
Gao Jingwen, a professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University, quoted the news as saying that Beijing has dispatched about 2,000 mainland police officers familiar with Cantonese from Hong Kong to the vicinity of Guangdong, and there are still people coming to Hong Kong.
Some commentators said that the Hong Kong people were only trying to win the democratic electoral power given in the Basic Law, and they were all overwhelmed by the CCP. The rumors of the rape, rape and demonstrators of the Hong Kong police have been rumored. White people and triad slashing incidents have occurred frequently. Recently, the massacre of the mobs biting off the ears of the members of the legislature has caused Hong Kong people to see the tyranny of the CCP.
