""Their (selectors) thinking in terms of modern-day cricket is not up to the mark,"" Yuvraj said.
Yuvraj isn't pleased at Pant being dropped from the Test XI.
Like in the case of Pant, Yuvraj wants the selectors to be patient with Shivam Dube, who failed on his India debut.


MUMBAI: Retired players are normally relaxed. However, Yuvraj Singh is not.
Sporting a red jacket and trademark black shades, India's hero of the World T20 in 2007 and the World Cup in 2011, looks as stylish as ever. Having retired in June, he now plies his trade to different leagues across the world with the latest being the Abu Dhabi T10 league, set to begin from November 14.
However, he seems to be angry. And his ire is directed at India's selection committee, headed by MSK Prasad. It's a panel which has already come under fire from greats like Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar and Farokh Engineer. And Yuvraj doesn't mince words too.
""We do need better selectors. Their job isn't easy. But their thinking in terms of modern-day cricket is not up to the mark. I'm always in favour of protecting players and being positive about them. By talking negative about your players and the team, it doesn't show you in good light. Your character only shows when things are going wrong and you motivate the players. In bad times, everyone talks bad. We definitely need better selectors,"" he says.
One of his pet peeves is about the No 4 spot. It was evident in his recently sarcastic tweet to his close friend, veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh: ""Top order is very strong bro. They don't need No 4 batsman.""



Explaining his tweet, Yuvraj says: ""What I am trying to say is we need to find a No 4. It was actually a joke, but we need to find a No. 4 and respect the No. 4 batsman, and give him a longer run. Every day some No. 4 is batting and we have loose statements about that player. After me, it was (Ambati) Rayudu, who played for a whole year, then he got dropped, now Risbhabh after playing well at No. 4 in one game, we hear remarks that he is not doing well, so how are you going to find a No 4 batsman? You are not going to find him by criticizing or dropping him, whether it is Rishabh or Shreyas or any other batsman. You have to give them a longer run.""
Yuvraj isn't pleased at Pant being dropped from the Test XI. ""He has only played 8-10 ODIs, so you've got to give that guy six months or a year to get better and try and play him as much as you can wherever you think he fits well. He not playing the Tests was not a great call,"" he laments.
Like in the case of Pant, Yuvraj wants the selectors to be patient with Mumbai all-rounder Shivam Dube, who failed on his India debut on Sunday night, too.
""He has the talent. I was watching him play and there are a couple of things that need to be worked on. I am not sure if they will be able to identify the mistakes. Vikram Rathour is the batting coach, he needs to identify where he is making a mistake. He is not someone who has played T20, so I am not sure if he can tell what are the areas that he needs to work on. Give him some time. Don't expect that Shivam Dube aayega, chaar chhakkey marega. In between, there was your Vijay Shankar, the '3 D player', now he's vanished. How can you make players this way,"" he asks.
