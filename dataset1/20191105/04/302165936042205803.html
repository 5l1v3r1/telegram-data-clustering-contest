      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Nov 5 — The federal welfare assistance payments this month will be credited to the accounts of 484,828 recipients throughout the country from November 7 and is expected to be finalised by or before November 10, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.</p>
      <p>She said the delayed payments were caused by technical issues over the procedure of transferring the money to the agencies.</p>
      <p>“The allocation has been approved, but not yet credited into the accounts... it is time, but there was a technical glitch. The ministry apologises,” Dr Wan Azizah who is also women, family and community development minister, told reporters after delivering a keynote address at the Malaysia’s Halal Inclusion Roundtable and Masterclass here today</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, Social Welfare Director Zulkifli Ismail said the late payments this month were due to technical problems.</p>
      <p>Dr Wan Azizah said the ministry had improved the procedure to ensure that the problem did not happen again. — Bernama</p>
