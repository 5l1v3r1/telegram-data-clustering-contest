砂销售税将损害齐力的收益
05 Nov 2019, 04:56 by Wong Swee May
（吉隆坡5日讯）大马投资银行维持齐力工业（Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd）的“守住”评级，目标价3.83令吉不变，并表示砂拉越州销售税（SST）可能会损害该公司未来的收益。
大马投行今日在报告中指出，齐力目前正在就新的税项寻求州政府说明。
该研究机构表示，砂州政府昨日提议从2020年1月起，向铝制品出口征收1%的销售税。
“根据预估，新税将使齐力在2020至2021财政年产生6400万和8900万令吉的成本，导致净利预测下降6至8%，目标价因而调降约7%至3.54令吉。”
该机构维持2019至2021财年铝平均售价于每吨1800至2000美元的预测，因预期产量增长6至7%，而中国今年的消费料增长5%，以及全球氧化铝供应短缺，提振氧化铝价格为每吨390至430美元。
此外，大马投行对齐力保持谨慎态度，因铝价疲软和氧化铝投入成本高，导致赚幅遭压缩，全球铝冶炼厂的盈利前景仍不明朗。
此外，与全球同行相比，齐力的估值高，意味着股价的上涨空间可能受限。
“不过，齐力最近与砂拉越能源（Sarawak Energy Bhd）签署15年期的购电协议，供应500兆瓦的电力，使其能够为32万吨的铝冶炼年产能提供额外的电力，从而缓解上述问题。”
该机构认为，齐力的整体冶炼产能将从目前的76万吨，提高42%至2021年的108万吨。
休市时，该股挂4.65令吉，跌15仙或3.13%，是主要下跌股之一，市值报187亿8600万令吉。

Sand sales tax will damage the benefits of Qi Li
05 Nov 2019, 04:56 by Wong Swee May
KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 5): Malaysian Investment Bank maintains the “hold” rating of Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd with a target price of RM3.83 and said that the Sarawak State Sales Tax (SST) may damage the future of the company. income.
The Malaysian Investment Bank said in its report today that Qi Li is currently seeking a state government statement on the new tax.
The research institute said that the Sarawak government proposed yesterday to impose a 1% sales tax on aluminum products exports from January 2020.
""According to estimates, the new tax will enable Qi Li to generate costs of RM64 million and RM89 million in the fiscal year 2020-2021, resulting in a 6-8% drop in net profit forecast and a target price reduction of 7% to RM3.54.""
The agency maintains an average aluminum sales price of $1800-2000 per ton for the fiscal year 2019-2021, due to expected production growth of 6 to 7%, while China’s consumption of this year is expected to increase by 5%, and global alumina supply shortages boost The price of alumina is between $390 and $430 per ton.
In addition, the Malaysian investment bank's alignment is cautious. As the aluminum price is weak and the alumina input cost is high, the profit margin is compressed, and the profit prospects of the global aluminum smelter are still unclear.
In addition, compared with its global counterparts, Qi Li's valuation is high, which means that the stock price may be limited.
“However, Qi Li recently signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with Sarawak Energy Bhd to supply 500 megawatts of electricity, enabling it to provide additional electricity for the annual capacity of 320,000 tons of aluminum smelting, thereby alleviating the above. problem.""
The agency believes that Qi Li's overall smelting capacity will increase by 42% from the current 760,000 tons to 1.08 million tons in 2021.
At the close of the market, the stock hangs 4.65 ringgit, down 15 sen or 3.13%, is one of the major decliners, with a market capitalization of RM187.86 billion.
