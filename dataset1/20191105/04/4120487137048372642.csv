05 Nov 2019, 04:13

【点滴新闻网雅加达11月4日讯】国营企业部长埃里克·多希尔(Erick Thohir)周一（11月4日）召见印尼火车公司PT KAI总裁埃迪（Edi Sukmoro）、国家电力公司（PT PLN）总裁丝莉贝尼（Sripeni Inten Cahyani）以及印尼国营石油公司(PT Pertamina)总裁妮格(Nicke Widyawati)，讨论正在建设过程中的雅加达-万隆高铁项目(简称“雅万高铁”)。会议结束后，埃迪说，重点是国企部长要求全面快速完成雅万高铁项目，不得再有任何工程进度的耽搁。埃迪接着说，雅万高铁项目建设已取得良好的进展。 对于工程征地，目前仅剩1％征地还待解决，整体工程进度目前已达到约30％。希望往后工程进度会更加顺利推进。雅万高铁建设过程中遇到的问题，例如国电公司的超高压空气管道（Sutet），但是相关部门PLN和Pertamina已达成共识，将超高压空气管道位置转移，距离施工地约几米的地方，所以该问题基本上已获得适当解决。埃迪解释说。然而，丝莉贝尼和妮格当媒体工作人员询问时不愿发表对会议的评论。众所周知，雅万高铁是中国企业以合资方式参与投资、建设与运营，全部工程采用中国高铁技术。印尼中国两国政府高度重视的双边合作旗舰的项目。雅万高铁是东南亚首条高铁，被视为能促进印尼经济发展，造福印尼人民的工程。根据印尼信息与通讯部宣传短片，高铁建成后，雅加达、万隆两市通行时间将从3—5小时压缩为45分钟，极大改善当地交通状况，便利沿线民众。同时，将进一步带动高铁沿线区域基建、商业、电子、物流和旅游产业开发，提升区域经济社会发展水平。

Jakarta, November 4th - State business minister Erick Thohir summoned Edi Sukmoro, president of Indonesian train company PT KAI, and the National Power Company on Monday (November 4) PT PLN) President Sripeni Inten Cahyani and Indonesian National Petroleum Corporation (PT Pertamina) President Nicke Widyawati discuss the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail project (""Yawan High Speed Rail"") under construction . After the meeting, Eddie said that the focus is on the request of the Minister of State-owned Enterprises to complete the Yawan high-speed rail project in a comprehensive and rapid manner, and there must be no further delays in the progress of the project. Eddie went on to say that the construction of the Yawan high-speed rail project has made good progress. For the land acquisition of the project, only 1% of the land acquisition still needs to be resolved, and the overall project progress has reached about 30%. I hope that the progress of the project will be smoother in the future. The problems encountered during the construction of the Yawan high-speed railway, such as Guodian’s ultra-high-pressure air pipeline (Sutet), but the relevant departments PLN and Pertamina have reached a consensus to transfer the position of the ultra-high pressure air duct, about a few meters away from the construction site, so This problem has basically been properly resolved. Eddie explained. However, Silly Beni and Nicole were reluctant to comment on the meeting when asked by the media staff. As we all know, Yawan High-speed Railway is a Chinese company that participates in investment, construction and operation in a joint venture. All projects use China's high-speed rail technology. The flagship project of bilateral cooperation is highly valued by the Indonesian and Chinese governments. Yawan High Speed Rail is the first high-speed rail in Southeast Asia and is regarded as a project that can promote the economic development of Indonesia and benefit the people of Indonesia. According to the promotional video of the Indonesian Ministry of Information and Communications, after the completion of the high-speed rail, the transit time in Jakarta and Bandung will be reduced from 3-5 hours to 45 minutes, greatly improving local traffic conditions and facilitating people along the route. At the same time, it will further promote the development of infrastructure, commerce, electronics, logistics and tourism industries along the high-speed rail area, and enhance the level of regional economic and social development.
