05 Nov 2019, 04:12

【新浪网】英国下议院11月4日举行新议长选举，以接替上个月31日卸任的议长约翰伯考。现任副议长林赛霍伊尔（Lindsay Hoyle）有望当选为下议院议长。据《联合早报》4日报道，英国下议院于当日选举新议长，以接替10月31日卸任的议长伯考。鉴于英国将于12月12日举行大选，本届议会将在11月6日、即两天后解散，并正式启动为期五周的竞选活动。《联合早报》援引英国博彩公司立博（Ladbrokes）报道，现任副议长霍伊尔最有望当选英国下议院新议长。据海外网报道，目前共有8名议员竞选议长职位，其中热门人选有工党女议员哈里特哈曼（Harriet Harman）、现任副议长林赛霍伊尔、保守党女议员埃莉诺莱恩（Eleanor Laing）。林赛霍伊尔自2010年起就开始担任伯考的副手，他成为工党议员已有22年之久，也是议长职位的有力竞争者。现年56岁的伯考因多次在议会上大喊“Order”（秩序）控制场面走红，成为英国政坛最具辨识度的人物之一。伯考2009年首次当选为英国下院议长，在接下来的十年里，他先后三次获得连任，是自二战以来英国在位时间最久的议长。今年9月，伯考宣布将10月31日离任，他说，自己担任议长10年，担任议员22年，“这是我生命中最高的荣耀”。

New Speaker of the House of Commons election, the current deputy speaker, Hoyle, is expected to be elected

05 Nov 2019, 04:12

[Sina.com] The British House of Commons held a new presidential election on November 4th to replace John Bokau, the speaker who stepped down on the 31st of last month. The current deputy speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is expected to be elected as the Speaker of the House of Commons. According to the ""Lianhe Zaobao"" reported on the 4th, the British House of Commons elected the new speaker on the same day to replace the Speaker of the House of Directors who took office on October 31. In view of the fact that the United Kingdom will hold a general election on December 12, the current parliament will be dissolved on November 6, two days later, and a five-week campaign will be officially launched. The Lianhe Zaobao quoted British bookmaker Ladbrokes as saying that the current deputy speaker, Hoyle, is most likely to be elected as the new speaker of the British House of Commons. According to overseas reports, there are currently 8 members of the House of Representatives running for the position of Speaker. Among them, there are Labour Party members Harriet Harman, current Vice-President Lindsay Hoyle, Conservative Party Member Eleanor Laing (Eleanor Laing) ). Lindsay Hoyle has been a deputy of Berkshire since 2010. He has been a Labour Party member for 22 years and is a strong contender for the position of the Speaker. The 56-year-old Bokoin has repeatedly screamed in the parliament for ""Order"" (order) control scene, becoming one of the most recognizable figures in British politics. Boko was elected as the Speaker of the British House of Representatives for the first time in 2009. In the following ten years, he was re-elected three times, the longest-serving speaker in the UK since World War II. In September this year, Berkau announced that he will leave his post on October 31. He said that he has served as the speaker for 10 years and has served as a member for 22 years. ""This is the highest glory in my life.""
