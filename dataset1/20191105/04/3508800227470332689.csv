川普讓美國正式退出巴黎氣候協定，可能帶來哪些衝擊？
05 Nov 2019, 04:51 by 李秉芳


我們想讓你知道的是美國退出也可能面臨嚴重的外交反彈，歐洲、中國和其他國家可能拒絕在川普政府在意的議題上與美國合作，更嚴重的是其他國家可能決定對美國課徵碳關稅。



（中央社）美國昨（4）日正式通知聯合國，將退出《巴黎氣候協定》（Paris Agreement），成為至今唯一退出這項協定的國家。美國國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）宣布退出消息，這將在一年後生效；他並重申川普（港譯「特朗普」）總統去年的談話稱，《巴黎氣候協定》對美國形成了「不公平的經濟負擔」。



根據白宮的聲明，退出協定主因為川普政府認為，歐巴馬（港譯「奧巴馬」）所簽署的這份協定，當中的綠色氣候基金（Green Climate Fund）耗費美國巨大財富，美國作為已開發國家必須援助開發中國家改善他們的排放，另外在條款中對美國施加的嚴格的能源和經濟限制，到2025年可能會使美國損失270萬個工作崗位，並讓鋼鐵、水泥、煤炭等產量都下降。川普也說，中國依然可以持續增加碳排放量、興建燃煤發電廠，但美國卻不行，這不公平。
《華盛頓郵報》報導，巴黎氣候協議在2016年11月4日正式生效，根據聯合國規則，3年內任何國家都不能退出，滿3年後才可以，提出後有一年等待期使退出完全生效。2019年11月4日，是川普政府可以發出退出通知的第一天，而他完全沒有浪費一點時間。這意味著美國可以在2020年11月4日，也就是明年總統大選日的隔天正式退出巴黎氣候協定。
如果民主黨贏得明年的總統大選，美國可能會在短暫缺席後，一如許多候選人承諾地重新加入該協定。但是如果川普順利連任，美國可能就此長期退出該國際協定。
《巴黎氣候協定》如何運作？
根據這項協定，每國必須個別提交因應溫室氣體排放的計畫，並定期舉行會談以檢討進展狀況，敦促彼此多加努力。
不同於先前的《京都議定書》，《巴黎氣候協定》不具備法律約束力，因此各國可按國內情勢修改計畫，並隨著環境變化做更動。若未達到目標也不會受到懲處，各界希望在同伴壓力和外交的影響之下，逐步加強履行這些政策。
歐巴馬政府在《巴黎氣候協定》中承諾，在2025年前，要使廢氣排放量較2005年減少26－28%；同時要在2020年前撥款30億美元（約903億元台幣）協助較貧窮國家達成減碳目標（美國迄今已撥款10億美元）。
中國大陸則承諾，溫室氣體排放量將於2030年前後達到上限，屆時無碳能源發電將占總發電量大約20%；印度也將繼續減少二氧化碳排放量。
美國退出《巴黎氣候協定》會如何？
由於這項協定不具有法律約束力，美國退出並不會受罰。
川普政府可啟動正式退出協定的機制，過程需耗費4年，但美國官員可立即停止參與接下來任何一場氣候會談。若未來政府願意，也能重新加入協定。
更極端的作法是，川普政府可能退出聯合國氣候變化綱要公約（United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change，UNFCCC），意味不參與聯合國發起的所有氣候會議。目前還不清楚川普政府會選擇何種方式。
美國決定退出，將與敘利亞和尼加拉瓜為伍，成為全球極少數未加入《巴黎氣候協定》的國家。美國退出也可能面臨嚴重的外交反彈。歐洲、中國和其他國家可能拒絕在川普政府在意的議題上與美國合作。更嚴重的情況是，其他國家可能決定對美國課徵碳關稅。
退出《巴黎氣候協定》對美國因應氣候變遷努力的意義為何？
無論美國是否退出《巴黎氣候協定》，川普政府都將繼續設法廢除歐巴馬政府在國內實施的氣候政策。
退出協定不代表美國內部全面停止減少排放的努力，加利福尼亞和紐約等州擬繼續推動當地發電廠和車輛的減排計畫。民營部門已逐漸轉向潔淨能源，便宜的天然氣和再生能源將持續取代火力發電廠。
不過美國對抗全球暖化的作為將大幅減少，紐約研究機構「榮鼎集團」（Rhodium Group）近期的分析顯示，在川普執政下，美國如今最可能在2025年前，比2005年減少15－19%的溫室氣體排放量，而非歐巴馬政府承諾的26－28%。
《華盛頓郵報》報導，科學家指出，2018年全球二氧化碳排放量破最高紀錄，突顯了世界應對氣候變化的願望，與各國所採取的實際行動間的差距。同時，川普政府還繼續積極削減歐巴馬時代為了減少碳排放的相關環境法規，包括從燃煤電廠加速能源轉型，以及提高美國汽車燃油效率的法規。川普表示，他認為增加化石燃料的生產（而非可再生能源和國際氣候協議）是美國更為重要的優先事項。
各國對美國退出將有何反應？
美國若是退出，可能會重創全球因應氣候暖化的努力，不過這個結果很大程度上也取決於其他國家作出何種反應。
歐洲各國、中國大陸和印度領導人堅稱，即使美國退出，這些國家仍將繼續處理全球暖化問題，其中中國外交部發言人華春瑩今天就表示，中國會遵守《巴黎氣候協定》；至於未來氣候談判的實際狀況則無法斷言。
可能性之一是，在全球第二大廢氣排放國美國退出之下，其他各國也許容易放鬆各自限制廢氣排放的計畫。專家指出，即使在歐洲這樣的地方，也有一些產業團體擔心競爭力問題。
至於印度、印尼和菲律賓等開發中國家，在美國提供援助以使這些國家能夠適應氣候變遷最嚴重效應的承諾作廢後，就可能較不願意處理各自的排放問題。
然而也不是人人都如此悲觀，澳洲國立大學氣候政策專家坎普（Luke Kemp）指出，其他國家在川普政府自行其是的情況下，也許會加緊開發比較潔淨的能源。
世界頭號排放源中國大陸就準備在未來談判時扮演主導角色。目前中國已大力投資風力、太陽能與核能發電，以圖調整往日需求無度的煤消耗量。至於中國領導人會力促他國提高這方面雄心到何種程度，則無從確定。
還有一個相關變數存在，即川普之後的美國政府可能會在氣候政策上改弦更張，甚至設法重新加入氣候協定。
通過近4年至今，僅有16國達到承諾減排標準
法國於2015年12月主持氣候峰會（COP21），促成195國通過《巴黎氣候協定》，要以工業時代前為基準，把全球氣溫增幅控制在至少攝氏2度以內，簽署國須遵守自主訂定的溫室氣體減量承諾，採取減少溫室氣體排放行動。但一份調查顯示，目前只有16國的行動足以達到各自承諾的標準，且無一出自歐盟。
《費加洛報》（Le Figaro）引述美國世界資源研究所（WRI）和英國葛拉漢氣候變遷和環境研究所（Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment）、氣候變遷經濟暨政策中心（CCCEP）的報告表示，承諾遵守《巴黎氣候協定》的國家中，僅有58國通過法律、採取全國性減碳措施以減少溫室氣體排放；其中只有16國採取的行動足以達到各自承諾的標準。
這16國包括挪威、蒙特內哥羅、北馬其頓、加拿大、哥斯大黎加、印尼、日本、馬來西亞、秘魯等。
川普就任後，2017年宣布退出協定，讓《巴黎氣候協定》缺少一塊重要拼圖。近期聯合國轄下機構及各地專家都預警，若人類不在這幾年實際減排溫室氣體，未來恐怕無力回天。

What impact might Trump have on the official withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement?
05 Nov 2019, 04:51 by Li Bingfang


What we want you to know is that the US withdrawal may also face a serious diplomatic rebound. Europe, China and other countries may refuse to cooperate with the United States on matters of concern to the Trump administration. What is more serious is that other countries may decide to enlist carbon for the United States. tariff.



(Central News Agency) The United States officially notified the United Nations yesterday (4) that it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement and become the only country to withdraw from the agreement. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the withdrawal, which will take effect one year later; he also reiterated that President Trump’s talk last year stated that the Paris Climate Agreement formed for the United States. ""Unfair economic burden.""



According to the White House’s statement, the withdrawal of the agreement is mainly because the Trump administration believes that the agreement signed by Obama (Hong Kong translation ""Obama""), the Green Climate Fund consumes huge US wealth, the United States has developed The state must assist developing countries to improve their emissions. In addition, the strict energy and economic restrictions imposed on the United States in the articles may result in the loss of 2.7 million jobs in the United States by 2025 and the production of steel, cement and coal. decline. Trump also said that China can continue to increase carbon emissions and build coal-fired power plants, but the United States does not, which is unfair.
The Washington Post reported that the Paris Climate Agreement came into effect on November 4, 2016. According to the UN rules, no country can quit within three years, and it can only be completed after three years. . On November 4, 2019, it was the first day that the Trump administration could issue an exit notice, and he did not waste a little time. This means that the United States can formally withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement on November 4, 2020, the next day next year's presidential election day.
If the Democratic Party wins next year's presidential election, the United States may, after a brief absence, rejoin the agreement as many candidates promised. However, if Trump is re-elected, the United States may withdraw from the international agreement for a long time.
How does the Paris Climate Agreement work?
According to the agreement, each country must submit individual plans for greenhouse gas emissions, and hold regular meetings to review progress and urge each other to work harder.
Unlike the previous Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Climate Agreement is not legally binding, so countries can modify the plan according to the domestic situation and make changes as the environment changes. If the target is not met, it will not be punished. All circles hope to gradually strengthen the implementation of these policies under the influence of peer pressure and diplomacy.
In the Paris Climate Agreement, the Obama administration promised to reduce emissions by 26-28% compared to 2005 by 2025. At the same time, it will allocate US$3 billion (about NT$90.3 billion) to assist by 2020. Poor countries have reached carbon reduction targets (the United States has allocated $1 billion to date).
Mainland China has promised that greenhouse gas emissions will reach the upper limit around 2030, when carbon-free energy generation will account for about 20% of total electricity generation; India will also continue to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
What will happen to the US exiting the Paris Climate Agreement?
Since the agreement is not legally binding, the United States will not be punished if it withdraws.
The Trump administration can initiate a formal exit mechanism, which takes four years, but US officials can immediately stop participating in any of the next climate talks. If the future government is willing, it can rejoin the agreement.
More extremely, the Trump administration may withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), meaning that it does not participate in all climate conferences initiated by the United Nations. It is not clear which way the Trump administration will choose.
The United States has decided to withdraw and will join Syria and Nicaragua as one of the few countries in the world that have not joined the Paris Climate Agreement. The US withdrawal may also face a serious diplomatic rebound. Europe, China and other countries may refuse to cooperate with the United States on matters of concern to the Trump administration. More seriously, other countries may decide to impose carbon tariffs on the United States.
What is the significance of withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement to the United States in response to climate change efforts?
Regardless of whether the United States withdraws from the Paris Climate Agreement, the Trump administration will continue to seek to abolish the climate policy implemented by the Obama administration in the country.
The withdrawal of the agreement does not represent a comprehensive cessation of emissions reduction efforts within the United States, and states such as California and New York intend to continue to promote emission reduction plans for local power plants and vehicles. The private sector has gradually turned to clean energy, and cheap natural gas and renewable energy will continue to replace thermal power plants.
However, the US's actions against global warming will be greatly reduced. According to a recent analysis by the Rhodium Group, a New York research institute, under Trump's administration, the United States is now most likely to be 15 years less than in 2005. 19% of greenhouse gas emissions, not 26-28% promised by the Obama administration.
The Washington Post reported that scientists pointed out that the global record of carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 broke the record, highlighting the world's desire to cope with climate change and the gap between the actual actions taken by countries. At the same time, the Trump administration continues to actively reduce environmental regulations in the Obama era to reduce carbon emissions, including accelerating energy transitions from coal-fired power plants and improving fuel efficiency in US vehicles. Trump said he believes that increasing fossil fuel production (rather than renewable energy and international climate agreements) is a more important priority for the United States.
How will countries react to the withdrawal of the United States?
If the United States withdraws, it may hit the global effort to cope with climate warming, but this result will largely depend on how other countries respond.
European, Chinese and Indian leaders insist that even if the United States withdraws, these countries will continue to deal with global warming issues. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said today that China will abide by the Paris Climate Agreement. The actual state of future climate negotiations cannot be asserted.
One possibility is that other countries may be able to relax their plans to limit emissions when the United States, the world's second-largest emitter of emissions, exits. Experts pointed out that even in places like Europe, some industrial groups are worried about competitiveness.
Developing countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines may be less willing to deal with their emissions issues after they have provided assistance to enable them to adapt to the most serious effects of climate change.
However, not everyone is so pessimistic, Luke Kemp, a climate policy expert at the Australian National University, points out that other countries may step up their efforts to develop cleaner energy if the Trump administration is doing what it is.
The world's number one source of emissions China is ready to play a leading role in future negotiations. At present, China has invested heavily in wind power, solar energy and nuclear power generation in an effort to adjust the excessive coal consumption in the past. As for the extent to which Chinese leaders will urge other countries to raise their ambitions in this regard, it is impossible to determine.
There is also a related variable, that is, the US government after Trump may change its climate policy and even try to rejoin the climate agreement.
Through nearly four years, only 16 countries have reached the promised emission reduction standards
In December 2015, France hosted the Climate Summit (COP21), which led the 195 countries to adopt the Paris Climate Agreement. The global temperature increase should be controlled to at least 2 degrees Celsius based on the pre-industrial era. Signatories must abide by their own regulations. The greenhouse gas reduction commitment is to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, according to a survey, only 16 countries are currently able to achieve the standards they have promised, and none of them are from the EU.
Le Figaro quotes the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, the Climate Change Economics and Policy Center (CCCEP) The report indicates that only 58 countries that have committed to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement have passed laws and adopted national carbon reduction measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; only 16 of them have taken actions to meet their respective commitments.
The 16 countries include Norway, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Canada, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Peru.
After Trump took office, he announced his withdrawal from the agreement in 2017, leaving the Paris Climate Agreement without an important puzzle. Recently, the UN agencies and local experts have warned that if human beings do not actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the past few years, the future may not be able to return to the sky.
