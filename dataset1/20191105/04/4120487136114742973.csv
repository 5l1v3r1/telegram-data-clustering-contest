【观察者网】泰国媒体称RCEP已完成协商，包括印度。尽管印度“又拖后腿”，但涵盖16国的《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP）谈判在最后关头可能又现转机。据路透社11月4日援引泰方消息称，RCEP已经完成协商，周一（4日）晚些时候将在峰会上宣布成果，不过协议正式签署仍要等到明年。报道称，各国部长3日晚就RCEP协议谈判到深夜。泰国商务部长朱林4日表示：“昨晚已经完成协商。”“今天晚些时候，各国领导人将共同宣布RCEP协议的成功，印度也将参与其中，将会一起发表声明，”朱林说：“协议将在明年签署。”但澳大利亚贸易部长西蒙伯明翰接受采访时表示：“我的理解是厖印度将继续进行讨论和谈判，我们的大门始终对印度敞开。”路透社表示，澳方的不同表述令人对印度是否最后参加RCEP产生了新的疑问。路透社同时注意到，参加会议的印度官员对协议三缄其口，其他国家的官员则不予置评。泰国总理府发言人纳勒蒙周日（3日）表态时还并很谨慎。她对记者表示：“我们尚未达成结论。一旦达成就会宣布。各国部长仍在讨论一些关键议题。签字估计要到明年2月。”同样，日本广播协会（NHK）今天上午早些时候披露了他们获得的共同声明草案。这份草案中，15国表示在重要的关税等领域的实质性谈判已经完成，力争明年签字。其中并不包括印度。
