【Arran威士忌的斜槓思維5】新酒廠新包裝　從頭到腳的新氣象
05 Nov 2019, 08:57 by 林亦君
過去24年都維持一島一酒廠狀態的艾倫，在2019年3月迎來了新挑戰，他們在島嶼南方的Lagg新建一座酒廠，除了向老酒廠Lagg致敬之外，這也將是一座主力生產泥煤威士忌，而且充滿實驗精神的酒廠。



2016年，Arran宣布將興建新酒廠，以因應不斷增長的威士忌需求，2017年2月，酒廠選定了艾倫島南邊的Lagg開工，這個村落在1825年曾經有過一家合法威士忌蒸餾廠Lagg，是島嶼上深刻的歷史記憶。
雖然比預期的延遲一些，但全新的Lagg酒廠終於完工，且在2019年3月19日首次蒸餾取酒，4月10日裝填了第一個橡木桶。令人驚異的是，這家新酒廠宣稱以泥煤為主力，編號第一的酒桶，是以Lagg生產的重泥煤威士忌，填裝在雪莉酒桶中。

高達50ppm的重泥煤、濃郁的煙燻風味，與此前的老lagg與Arran羅赫蘭札廠的甜美風格大相迥異，就連銷售方式也更加直接，一號桶直接預留給Lagg Cask協會的成員，至各協會由購買Lagg烈酒的個人組成。700個第一批灌裝桶中，超過一半已經售出，感興趣的酒迷可以成為Lagg Cask協會的一員，再進行購買。
作為蘇格蘭最新的單一麥芽威士忌釀酒廠之一，Lagg不走復古路線，而以大片落地玻璃營造前衛感，蒸餾廠裡有一對全新的蒸餾器與4個木製發酵槽，遊客可以近距離觀看Arran威士忌的生產過程，遊客中心裡有影像展示Lagg與Arran的歷史，還有一間咖啡館和餐廳，所有食材都源自本地，極具特色，預計到2020年，一南一北兩間酒廠可以吸引超過20萬遊客造訪。
藉著新酒廠開幕的機會，艾倫也宣布全面換新包裝，基本酒款的外觀，從瓶蓋、瓶身到LOGO字體，都變得簡潔明亮，雖然我也很鍾愛他們的「惡魔的酒缸」和「走私者」系列的酒標，不過新包裝看起來確實時尚許多，由此看來，Arran的斜槓哲學仍是現在進行式，百變風格也不是說說而已。

[Arran whisky slash thinking 5] new winery new packaging from head to toe new weather
05 Nov 2019, 08:57 by Lin Yijun
Allen, who has maintained the status of an island and a winery for the past 24 years, ushered in a new challenge in March 2019. They built a new winery in Lagg in the south of the island. In addition to paying tribute to the old winery Lagg, this will also be A winery that produces peat whiskey and is full of experimental spirit.



In 2016, Arran announced that it will build a new winery in response to the growing demand for whisky. In February 2017, the winery selected Lagg to the south of Allen Island, which had a legal whisky distillery, Lagg, in 1825. It is a profound historical memory on the island.
Although delayed than expected, the new Lagg winery was finally completed, and the first distilled wine was taken on March 19, 2019, and the first oak barrel was filled on April 10. Surprisingly, the new winery claims to be peat-based, the number one casks, filled with heavy peat whiskey from Lagg, packed in sherry casks.


There are 4 wooden fermentation tanks in the Lagg winery, which is quite spectacular. (available from Arran Winery)

The spirits safe also started to work. (available from Arran Winery)

Up to 50ppm of heavy peat and rich smoky flavor, which is very different from the sweet style of the old lagg and Arran Rohranza factory, even the sales method is more direct. The first bucket is reserved directly to the Lagg Cask Association. Members of each association are made up of individuals who purchase Lagg spirits. More than half of the 700 first batches of barrels have been sold, and interested fans can become a member of the Lagg Cask Association and make purchases.
As one of Scotland's newest single malt whisky distillers, Lagg does not take the retro route, but with a large floor-to-ceiling glass for avant-garde, the distillery has a pair of brand new distillers and 4 wooden fermentation tanks, allowing visitors to see Arran up close In the production process of whiskey, there are images in the visitor center showing the history of Lagg and Arran, as well as a cafe and restaurant. All the ingredients are from the local and very special. It is expected that by 2020, two wineries in the south and north can Attracting more than 200,000 visitors.
Through the opening of the new winery, Allen also announced a full replacement of the new packaging, the appearance of the basic wine, from the bottle cap, bottle to LOGO font, have become simple and bright, although I also love their ""devil's wine The label of the ""cylinder"" and ""smugglers"" series, but the new packaging looks really fashionable. From this point of view, Arran's slash philosophy is still the current one, and the changeable style is not just a talk.


The sleek bottle and the simple and degraded LOGO show that the winery wants to take fashion style to attract young people. (available from Arran Winery)



The design of the wine label was simple and clear, and even the LOGO fonts were changed. (available from Arran Winery)

The outer packaging of the box also goes round the pure white route. (available from Arran Winery)
