      <h1>Martin Keown wades into Cesc Fabregas' Dennis Bergkamp debate with brutal comment</h1>
      <h2>Martin Keown took offence to the notion that Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp was overrated</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:10:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Martin Keown has waded into the Dennis Bergkamp debate with a withering put-down.</p>
      <p>Bergkamp became the subject of conversation when talkSPORT presenter Adrian Durham claimed the Dutchman was overrated.</p>
      <p>Speaking on talkSPORT, Durham told his listeners: "If [Dennis] Bergkamp was that good, why didn't <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> win the Champions League, or back-to-back titles?</p>
      <p>"He never scored 20 goals in a season in the Premier League for Arsenal. And he was there over 10 years. That's not good."</p>
      <p>The controversial comments ruffled the feathers of a few listeners, including former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who felt obliged to hit back.</p>

      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter,</a> Fabregas shared the segment from the radio show and wrote: "Is this guy serious? Lost the plot big time there."</p>
      <p>"If you don't think Bergkamp was that good, then you don't understand this sport at all."</p>
      <p>As you'd expect, a number of Gunners supporters praised Fabregas' response.</p>

      <p>And it wasn't just fans of the north London either who liked or replied to the tweet, but an ex-player in the form of Keown.</p>
      <p>Quote-tweeting Fabregas, the former Gunners centre-back wrote: "Who are we believing... one of the greatest midfielders of his generation or (you'll probably need to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> him) Adrian Durham?"</p>
