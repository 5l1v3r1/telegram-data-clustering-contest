Make OxygenOS look more Pixel-like with the Out of Oxygen Substratum theme
05 Nov 2019, 08:33 by Tushar Mehta
OxygenOS by OnePlus is among the most loved Android interfaces. Drawing its philosophy from custom ROMs like yesteryears’ most popular ROM – CyanogenMod, OxygenOS features an almost-stock Android UI with several options for customization. Over the years, little changes in OxygenOS has magnified to the extent that it now has its own iconography and peculiar design elements. But if the old soul in you wants a look closer to AOSP on your OnePlus device, you can use a Magisk module called “Out of Oxygen” along with Substratum to get your OnePlus smartphone’s UI to look like a Google Pixel.
Substratum barely needs any introduction but if you’ve been out of the loop, it’s a theming engine that allows you to apply system-wide or per-app themes. This app comes in handy especially for devices, like those from OnePlus, that do not come with a native theme store. Further, while Substratum usually requires you to root your phone, you can use an add-on called Andromeda to utilize the goodness of Substratum even without root access on your phone.
