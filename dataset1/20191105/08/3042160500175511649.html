      <p>An “irate” Georgia man reportedly used a racial slur during a fight with two men at a Waffle House and ended up shot dead on Halloween.</p>
      <p>The Waffle House on Ga. 36 in Butts County is about 50 miles southeast of Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Phinazee Bryan, 27, was directing racial slurs at Robert Lewis Henderson Jr., 36, and Antonio DeMarty Evans, 39, when Waffle House staff members asked him to leave, according to a Georgia Bureau of Investigation news release.</p>

      <p>Instead of leaving, Bryan got into “a physical altercation” with Evans, and Henderson fired one round at Bryan, hitting him, the GBI said.</p>
      <p>The incident led to three separate calls within minutes of each other just before 11 p.m. about “disturbances” at the restaurant, according to the GBI.</p>
      <p>The first call was about an “irate customer,” the second about a fight and the third about shots fired, the GBI said.</p>
      <p>When deputies arrived at the restaurant, they found Bryan with a gunshot wound, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Bryan was taken to the Monroe County Hospital about 15 miles away in Forsyth, and he died at about 3 a.m. Friday, the GBI said.</p>
      <p>The agency is investigating the shooting at the request of the Butts County Sheriff’s Office. GBI has not confirmed whether the two men had been arrested or charged.</p>
      <p>Bryan was taken to the GBI Crime Lab, where an autopsy will be performed.</p>
