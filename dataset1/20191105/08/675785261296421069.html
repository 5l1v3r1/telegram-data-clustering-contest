      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn's general election journey to Brexit clarity - up to a point</h1>
      <h2>The Labour leader will outline the party's approach in a Leave-supporting Essex town</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:30:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Morning,</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been repeatedly criticised for his lack of clarity on Brexit.</p>
      <p>For a long time, that criticism was completely justified – the only thing that was clear about his position was that he was going out of his way not to adopt one.</p>
      <p>But gradually he has been guided towards a stance that at least goes some way towards giving clarity.</p>
      <p>Labour's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-using-brexit-sell-20812400">current offer is to renegotiate a Withdrawal Agreement</a> – that'll be the third deal with Brussels – within three months of getting elected.</p>
      <p>That new pact will then be put to a referendum.</p>
      <p>This is where it becomes tricky for Corbyn; he has steadfastly refused to say if in that referendum campaign he would urge voters to back Leave with his deal or if he would fight for Remain.</p>

      <p>Many Shadow Cabinet big-hitters – including key allies of the leadership – have said they will battle for Remain come what may.</p>
      <p>(Also, as one Labour MP pointed out to me recently, it's totally fair to say that in 2016 voters did not know what sort of Brexit they were voting for – but now they know what the options are, any second referendum should be on a deal or no-deal departure, given the decision to Leave has already been taken. But that's not going to happen.)</p>
      <p>Today, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-using-brexit-sell-20812400">Corbyn will come under huge pressure to say what he will do in that campaign</a> .</p>
      <p>Do not expect him to yield.</p>

      <p>The Labour leader is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-using-brexit-sell-20812400">giving a speech in Harlow, Essex</a> – a town that voted Leave by 68% to 32%, and where the Conservatives enjoy a 7,000 majority.</p>
      <p>Expect the speech to focus on Labour's attack line – repeatedly denied by the the Tories – that Boris Johnson wants to “hijack” Brexit to allow US drugs firms into the NHS.</p>
      <p>We have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/cosy-links-between-white-house-20812337">explored the cosy links between Donald Trump's administration and Big Pharma in a special report today</a> .</p>
      <p>Corbyn will also accuse the Prime Minister of wanting to “unleash Thatcherism on steroids”.</p>
