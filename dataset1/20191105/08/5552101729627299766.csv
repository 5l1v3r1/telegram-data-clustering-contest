高學歷等於人生勝利組？　台大生嘆「在台灣會念書是個陷阱」
05 Nov 2019, 08:23 by 吳妍
在許多家長心目中，子女成績好、考進名校無疑是一件值得驕傲的事情，高學歷幾乎就等於是人生勝利組。一名台大學生在論壇「Dcard」卻吐露心聲，直言「在台灣，會唸書其實是個陷阱」。
這位帳號顯示是國立臺灣大學的帳號提到，真心覺得「在台灣會念書其實是個陷阱」，因為會念書會得到非常非常多的讚賞，當有了名校光環，彷彿人生就此一片光明一帆風順，但其實這只是社會「畸形的期待」，而非自己想要的東西，然而等終於意識到時，已經來不及了，因為「機會成本很高，高到連你自己都不相信你可以放棄現在的生活，去追尋夢想」，更遑論家人或社會怎麼看待的眼光。
原PO提到，她從小就是家裡最會讀書的小孩，父親從小對她很嚴格，期待她「考上資優班、考上私中、考上明星高中、上台大」，不僅緊盯成績，當她沒考上資優班時，罰她跪一整天，還用藤條打她，打到藤條斷掉，甚至用風扇砸她頭。整個小三到國二，都活在父親家暴的陰影下，甚至是媽媽和兩個姊姊都同樣成為父親施暴的對象。
父親唯一會對她和顏悅色的時候，就是成績，當她拚死拚活考上台大時，父親到處向人炫耀「我女兒考上台大」，這不僅讓她感到噁心，也讓她很痛苦，因為她此時才意識到爸媽之所以把她當人看，是因為「我考上台大」，而不是終於學會好好愛她。

除了家人以外，進入台大以後，社會的期許和想像也讓原PO覺得不切實際，「怎麼能要求我們又會讀書，又要符合道德標準，多才多藝，要有國際觀，還要對社會有貢獻？不能犯錯，不能情商低，不能脆弱」，她怒吼「我們是人，不是神耶。」
原PO坦言被壓得喘不過氣，太多的期待與讚美成為詛咒，「我每天每天都要殺死自己，才能活下去，這就是上台大給我的詛咒，這就是整個社會給我們這種會讀書的人的一種詛咒。」
整篇文章在「Dcard」引起熱烈迴響，原PO隔天又再發文感謝網友們的安慰與鼓勵，其中她提到有些人認為她得了便宜還賣乖，酸「至少你有上台大」「我也好想落入這種陷阱」，她指出這正是台灣社會與教育的弔詭之處－－「不會念書的人被覺得沒有用，被瞧不起，羨慕會念書的人可以得到那麼多關注和讚美」，但她衷心希望，未來每個人都不用再被這套標準限制，而是好好支持彼此，看見彼此的長處。

High education is equal to the victory group of life? Taida sighs that ""it is a trap to study in Taiwan.""

In the minds of many parents, it is undoubtedly a matter of pride to have a good grade for children and to enter a prestigious school. High academic qualifications are almost equal to the victory group of life. A Taiwanese university student confided in the forum ""Dcard"" and bluntly said that ""in Taiwan, going to school is actually a trap.""
This account number is mentioned in the account of National Taiwan University. I really feel that ""it is a trap to study in Taiwan,"" because I will get a lot of appreciation for going to school. When I have a famous school aura, it seems that life is smooth and smooth, but In fact, this is just a ""deformed expectation"" of the society, not what you want. However, when you finally realize it, it is too late, because ""the opportunity cost is so high that even you don't believe that you can give up your life."" , to pursue the dream, let alone the eyes of the family or society.
The original PO mentioned that she was the child who was the best at home when she was a child. Her father was very strict with her since she was a child. She was expecting her to ""get into a gifted class, take a private test, get a star high school, and go on stage."" When she was not admitted to the gifted class, she was punished for a whole day, and she was beaten with rattan, hit the rattan, and even smashed her head with a fan. The whole small three to the country two, are living in the shadow of the father's domestic violence, even the mother and the two sisters are also the object of father's violence.
When the father only smiled at her, it was the result. When she was desperately trying to get on the stage, her father showed off ""My daughter was admitted to Taiwan"". This not only made her feel sick, but also made her very painful because she At this point, I realized that my parents saw her as a person because ""I was admitted to Taiwan,"" instead of finally learning to love her.

In addition to family members, after entering Taida University, the expectations and imaginations of the society made the original PO feel unrealistic. ""How can we ask us to study again, and we must meet ethical standards, be versatile, have an international outlook, and contribute to society? I can't make mistakes, I can't be emotionally low, I can't be weak."" She roared, ""We are human beings, not gods.""
The original PO frankly was overwhelmed, and too much expectation and praise became a curse. ""I kill myself every day to survive. This is the curse that the great Taiwan gave me. This is what the whole society gives us. A curse for those who can read.""
The whole article caused a warm echo in ""Dcard"". The original PO sent another text to thank the netizens for their comfort and encouragement. The younger one mentioned that some people think she has gotten cheap and sold it. ""At least you have a big stage."" I really want to fall into this trap."" She pointed out that this is the paradox of Taiwan's society and education--""People who are not studying are perceived to be useless, despised, and those who envy will be able to get so much attention and praise. ""But she sincerely hopes that everyone in the future will not be restricted by this set of standards, but will support each other and see each other's strengths.""
