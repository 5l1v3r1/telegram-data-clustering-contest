      <p>Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Tuesday said the government will be held responsible if anything happens to former president Asif Ali Zardari.</p>
      <p>The PPP chairman took to social media to express his concern for his father Asif Ali Zardari’s deteriorating health.</p>
      <p>Bilawal claimed that the former president has not been given access to specialist doctors or a personal physician.</p>

      <p>Last month, the Sindh health minister said PPP’s co-chairman was suffering from spinal pain because of a condition called spondylolysis and he desperately needed treatment which was only possible abroad.</p>
      <p>“There are no physicians available in Pakistan who can perform a spinal cord surgery on him [Zardari],” she said.</p>
      <p>The provincial minister said it was the responsibility of the state to provide all medical facilities to her brother.</p>
