      <p><i>"I think the viciousness of the bumps around here are pretty aggressive. The circuit’s advised us that there’s a significant amount of resurfacing as well as rectification works that need to go on. The bumps have got more severe in recent times with extremes of weather they’ve had here. To their credit, they undertook a lot of rectification work that could be done without compromising the track surface as much as possible,"</i> Horner added. </p>

It's unclear what exactly caused this to happen, but it's likely to be linked with the bumps. Verstappen went on to complete the race and finish on the podium. He was hunting down <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> in the closing stages of the race and would have had a chance to overtake for 2nd place had their not been yellow flags on the last lap. </p>
