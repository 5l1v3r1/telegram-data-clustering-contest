      <h1>By 2025, China Could Have TWO Stealth Bombers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>While the H-20 is slower and stealthier, the JH-XX would be faster.</p>
      <p>In January 2018, two sentences in an<a href="http://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/China_Military_Power_FINAL_5MB_20190103.pdf"> annual report</a> by the DIA on Chinese military power sent a minor shockwave rippling across the defense-related internet:</p>
      <p>“The PLAAF is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets. Stealth technology continues to play a key role in the development of these new bombers, which probably will reach initial operational capability no sooner than 2025.”</p>
      <p>Bombers, plural<i>. </i>In a separate chart, an un-designated next-generation “Tactical Bomber” is listed, denoted as being equipped with a high-resolution Active Electronically Scanned Array radar, precision-guided bombs and long-range air-to-air missiles.</p>
      <p>In the last few years, China’s development of what appears to be a subsonic long-range heavy <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-h-20-strategic-stealth-bomber-everything-we-know-right-now-38922">strategic bomber</a> called the H-20 has become increasingly evident—especially in 2018, when the Chinese government began<a href="https://youtu.be/YfrdMn60Mes?t=419"> teasing</a> a public unveiling to take place in 2019. The flying wing bomber, which apparently resembles the U.S. B-2 Spirit in form and function, is to be produced by Xi’an Aircraft Corporation, which already manufactures older<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-h-6-bomber-everything-you-want-know-about-beijings-b-18772"> H-6 strategic bombers</a> and the chubby<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/who-cares-about-chinas-stealth-fighter-or-aircraft-carriers-plane-america-needs-fear-33441"> Y-20 transport plane</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the stealth “tactical” or “medium” bomber was news—sort of. The fighter-bomber in question is believed to refer to the JH-XX, a rival stealth bomber concept proposed by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation believed to have been passed over in favor of the longer-range H-20. Shenyang is better known for producing fighters, including <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-stole-fighter-russia%E2%80%94-its-coming-the-south-china-sea-17087">Chinese derivatives</a> of the Russian Flanker jet and a J-31 stealth fighter which may be exported or serve on Chinese aircraft carriers.</p>
