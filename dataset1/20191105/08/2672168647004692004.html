      <p>A tremor hit Yangon on November 4 and residents from Ahlone, Kyauktada and Botahtaung townships felt the shake, sources said.</p>
      <p>“The movement occurred around 11:20 am and I thought a container truck crushed into something. But I didn’t see anything when I looked out at the road. My students are also frightened,” said Khaing Maung Yee, former MP.</p>
      <p>“Only a small wave is measured at Kabaraye seismological station and it cannot be made by naturally, said Deputy Director Dr Yin Myo Min Htwe from Earthquake sub-department under the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH).</p>
      <p>A government staff from Yangon Region government and a resident from Kyauktada Township also wrote about it in their social networks.</p>
      <p>“I was at outside when the jolt occurred. When I asked the general administrative department, they said residents from Kyauktada and Botahtaung townships felt the jolt,” said MP Nwe Nwe Win of No.2 Ahlone Constituency.</p>
      <p>Sagaing Fault is a 600-mile long fault stretching from north to south and Myanmar has small faults in addition to Kyaukkyan and Kabaw faults.</p>
      <p>The quake is a danger which cannot be expected in advance. People need to check buildings and furniture to avoid casualties and government departments have to be alerted to response and prepare, said experts.</p>
