      <h1>Brexit: Boris Johnson and Michael Gove categorically rule out delaying end date</h1>
      <h2>Put 31 December 2020 in your diaries - because Boris Johnson's team are once again claiming we won't delay a single day longer. If they're telling the truth, of course</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:47:43+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson's team have categorically ruled out delaying the final date of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> beyond 31 December 2020.</p>
      <p>Downing Street ruled out any extension to the 11-month transition period - the period for us to get an EU trade deal if Parliament agrees to leave by the end of January.</p>
      <p>And today no-deal Brexit planning chief <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-gove">Michael Gove</a> also ruled out an extension, which is a clear option in the Brexit deal with the EU.</p>
      <p>The comments will prompt fresh fears <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> would crash Britain out of the EU in a "trapdoor to no-deal" on New Year's Day 2021.</p>
      <p>Critics and many experts believe 11 months is not nearly long enough to secure a trade deal with the EU, whose negotiations with Canada took seven years. That leaves no-deal unless we extend.</p>
      <p>Yet voters may also question whether Boris Johnson, who is taking a hardline approach to keep the Brexit Party from taking Tory seats in the election, is telling the truth.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed he would not ask for a delay to Brexit beyond 31 October before he then asked for one, however grudgingly.</p>
      <p>A Downing Street spokesman said yesterday: "The Government will not be extending the  transition period.</p>
      <p>"The Prime Minister believes that we will have a good trade deal agreed with the EU by December 2020," the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"The Brexit process has been going on for long enough."</p>
      <p>Today Mr Gove was asked to confirm the position by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>
      <p>Asked if the transition period could be extended he said: "Uh, no."</p>
      <p>Asked "definitely not?" he replied: "Absolutely."</p>
      <p>He said that, while preparations would continue for a no-deal Brexit, he was confident they could get a new free trade agreement with the EU by that date.</p>
      <p>"We will ensure that we will have a proper free trade agreement with the European Union," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>
      <p>"It is always the case that we need to prepare for every eventuality, but I am confident that we will be able to get a good relationship with the EU at the end of this period.</p>
      <p>"It will be the case when - if we can get a majority government - we move into the close talks we have with them, there will be a strong interest from the Irish Government, from the French government, and from our other partners in making sure that we move to a new relationship."</p>
