      <h1>I'm not dying: Diego Maradona plays down health concerns</h1>

      <p>BUENOS AIRES: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FIFA-World-Cup">Football</a> legend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diego-Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> has played down fresh concerns about his health, insisting that he is well and relishing his role as head coach of Argentine club Gimnasia.</p>
      <p>Maradona's youngest daughter, Gianinna, raised fears about the 59-year-old' health when she posted on Instagram "they are killing him on the inside without him noticing", reports Xinhua news agency.</p>
      <p>The message, which included a call to "pray" for the 1986 World Cup winner, was seemingly a reference to media criticism of Maradona's work with Gimnasia as the club battles to avoid relegation from Argentina's top division.</p>
      <p>Maradona, who has had a long-standing public feud with Gianinna as well as his eldest daughter, Dalma, and their mother, Claudia Villafane, responded with his own Instagram post hours later.</p>
      <p>"I'm not dying at all," the former Boca Juniors, Barcelona and Napoli star said in a video published on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>"I sleep peacefully because I am working. I don't know what Gianinna meant. I know that as one gets older people care more about what you will leave behind than about what you are doing. I am very healthy," added the former No. 10, before vowing to pledge his wealth to charity in his will.</p>
      <p>Maradona has been Gimnasia's head coach since September 5, when he replaced Dario Ortiz just give games into the Superliga season. The La Plata-based outfit are currently 23rd in the 24-team standings with two wins and five losses under Maradona's command.</p>
      <p>Widely regarded as one of the best footballers ever, Maradona has suffered from a series of health issues since ending his playing career in 1997.</p>
      <p>In 2004, he was hospitalised with severe heart and respiratory problems related to a long battle with drug addiction. He has also undergone two gastric bypass operations to control his weight and received treatment for alcohol abuse.</p>
      <p>In January, Maradona had surgery to stem bleeding in his stomach and in July he underwent a knee operation.</p>
