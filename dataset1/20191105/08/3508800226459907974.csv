三大法人介紹（2）：「主動基金」與「被動基金」有什麼差異？
05 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 豹投資


我們想讓你知道的是投信的全名是證劵投資信託公司，也就是我們俗稱的基金公司。投信會向大眾募集資金，再交由專業經理人進行投資買賣，這些資金就是「共同基金」。



解釋完外資後，接下來我們要介紹三大法人中，原本交易量占台股比重第二大的投信。但自從2012年，投信的占比急速下降，從原本的3、4％減少到目前1％左右，甚至會少於1％。那到底是什麼原因使投信在台股上的占比，衰退得這麼快呢？繼續往下看就知道啦。
投信：其實就是基金公司啦
投信的全名是證劵投資信託公司，也就是我們俗稱的基金公司。投信會向大眾募集資金，再交由專業經理人進行投資買賣，這些資金就是「共同基金」。而這類型的基金，裡面投資組合的比例是專業經理人在調整，稱為「主動基金」；另一種會跟隨指數跑，進而調整投資組合比例的基金，叫做「被動基金」。
在主動基金的部份，由於近年來AI人工智慧及大數據的進步，許多投資人開始轉而相信更精密的電腦運算和分析，因此有越來越多傳統專業經理人被機器人所取代，使得交由投信操作的資金下降，交易量占比也跟著衰退。
此外，投信很看重績效，因為他們操作的是大眾投資人的錢，只要績效一直不好，就可能會被其他專業經理人淘汰。但操作時間又不像自營商那麼短，所以投信主要是做中長期投資。也因為是代理操作，受到政府的管制會較嚴格。
投信 vs. 投顧
有許多剛入門的新手會把投信和投顧搞混，但其實兩者之間是有差異的。
投信是可以發行、募集、銷售且管理基金的公司；投顧則是證券投資顧問，屬於顧問公司，因此只能代理已發行基金、募集、銷售但不負責管理基金。
簡單來說，投信所做的是基金的買賣，並負責操作管理，而投顧是提供諮詢的服務，投資人如果有問題，可以問他，所以不負責操作管理。

快速結論

投信就是基金公司，會向大眾募集資金，再交由專業經理人進行投資買賣，稱為「共同基金」。近年來投信受到AI人工智慧和大數據的強大挑戰，對台股的影響不如以前。
投信看重績效且因為是代理操作，受政府管制較嚴格。
投信與投顧最大不同在於，前者負責基金的管理操作，後者不負責。

Introduction of the three major legal persons (2): What is the difference between ""active funds"" and ""passive funds""?
05 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Leopard Investment


What we want you to know is that the full name of the letter is the Securities Investment Trust, which is commonly known as the fund company. The letter will raise funds from the public and then transfer it to professional managers for investment and purchase. These funds are ""mutual funds.""



After explaining the foreign investment, we will introduce the three major legal persons, the original transaction volume accounted for the second largest share of Taiwanese stocks. However, since 2012, the proportion of investment letters has dropped rapidly, from the original 3, 4% to the current 1% or even less than 1%. What is the reason for the decline in the proportion of investment in Taiwan stocks, so fast? Continue to look down and you will know.
Letter: In fact, it is a fund company.
The full name of the letter is the Securities Investment Trust Company, which is commonly known as the fund company. The letter will raise funds from the public and then transfer it to professional managers for investment and purchase. These funds are ""mutual funds."" In this type of fund, the proportion of the portfolio is adjusted by professional managers, called “active fund”; another fund that follows the index and adjusts the proportion of the portfolio is called “passive fund”.
In the part of the active fund, due to the advancement of AI artificial intelligence and big data in recent years, many investors have turned to believe in more sophisticated computer computing and analysis, so more and more traditional professional managers have been replaced by robots. The funds handed over to the credit operation decreased, and the proportion of transactions also followed the decline.
In addition, the letter is very important to performance, because they operate the money of the public investors, as long as the performance has not been good, it may be eliminated by other professional managers. But the operating time is not as short as the self-employed business, so the investment is mainly for medium and long-term investment. Also because it is an agent operation, it will be more strictly controlled by the government.
Passing the letter vs.
There are a lot of newcomers who are just getting started, and they will confuse the investment and investment, but there is a difference between the two.
Investment is a company that can issue, raise, sell, and manage funds; investment is a securities investment consultant and a consultant company, so it can only represent the issued funds, raise and sell, but is not responsible for managing the fund.
To put it simply, the investment is done by the fund, and it is responsible for the operation management. The investment is the service of providing consultation. If the investor has problems, he can ask him, so he is not responsible for operation management.



Cartography: Leopard Investment


Quick conclusion

The letter is the fund company, which will raise funds from the public and then transfer it to the professional manager for investment and trading, called ""mutual fund."" In recent years, investment letters have been challenged by AI artificial intelligence and big data, and the impact on Taiwan stocks is not as good as before.
The letter is worthy of performance and because it is an agent operation, it is subject to strict government control.
The biggest difference between credit and investment is that the former is responsible for the management of the fund, and the latter is not responsible.
