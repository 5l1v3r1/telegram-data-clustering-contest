Netflix introduces button to skip Trump jokes in new Seth Meyers comedy special
New feature is perfect if you're tired of hearing about the US president

Netflix has introduced a button that lets viewers skip jokes about US president Donald Trump on a new comedy special from Seth Meyers.
The comedian and chat show host’s new comedy special, titled Lobby Baby, sees him take aim at the president, whom he previously branded a “racist gargoyle”.
Meyers told CNN Business that it was his idea to introduce the feature, deeming a politics joke-avoiding button as “a funny and innovative way” to “take advantage of the Netflix experience”.
“It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, ‘Oh, let me guess, there’s going to be jokes about the president’,” he said.
Meyers described the button as a “joke”, adding: “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, well, that’s a nice touch, but you’re not going to eat the parsley.”
The host is a frequent critic of Trump. In July, Seth Meyers devoted eight minutes of his talk show condemning him for his spate of racist tweets aimed at progressive Democratic congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.
Lobby Baby will be available to stream on Netflix later today (5 November).
