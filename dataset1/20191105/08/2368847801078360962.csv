胡耀邦去世前 女兒感知到神秘第六感

05 Nov 2019, 08:53

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】心理學家認為，所謂「第六感」是人體一種瞬間而直接的預知。據統計，在第六感方面，女性的正確率普遍要大於男性。胡耀邦的女兒在回憶錄中提到父親去世前，她感知到神秘的第六感，「它實在太神秘，神秘得連它的存在都變得可疑。但我確確實實地感知到了。」
胡耀邦女兒滿妹撰寫的《思念依然無盡——回憶父親胡耀邦》一書中寫道：剛過完1989年元旦沒幾天，父親的警衛秘書就打電話給我，談到父親多次問起滿妹現在忙些什麼，是不是很快就要出國了。
我知道父親一定是想我了，便撂下手頭已經辦得差不多的工作，向單位請了幾天年假趕往長沙，想在臨行前再陪父親聊聊天，散散步。
跟父母一起住了3天，我對父親說：「爸爸，我得回北京了。出國前醫學會要召開全國第二十次會員代表大會，我負責大會文件和會務組織；另外，也還有些工作要交代。」
沒想到父親居然一反常態，執意不讓我走，竟說：「開會的人多得很，不缺你一個嘛！」轉而問我，「你去過廣西沒有？」
我怔怔地回答：「80年代初去過一次。」
父親笑了：「噢，那還是好幾年前的事了，現在廣西變化大得很，一起去看看嘛！」
其實，我又何嘗不想多陪陪他呢！於是我和父親商量，到南寧的當天下午我就走。
父親一愣，詫異地問：「這麼急？」他停了一下，又說，「好嘛，好嘛，要走就走吧！」
在火車上幸福地和父母晃蕩了一天，到南寧已經是次日中午。看着大家安頓好都住下後，就到了向他們告別的時間。
至今我仍清晰地記得，那天父親穿着深駝色的中山裝，外面披了一件藏青色的呢子夾大衣。他和母親一起出來送我，走在母親和一群工作人員的前面。我們倆並排走着，他右手指間夾着香菸，無語地一直把我送到賓館外院的汽車旁。
一路上他都在微笑着，可眼神兒裡卻漾出我從未見過的傷感。就在這一剎那，我似乎感應到了某種無法詮釋的人體信息，體內隨之旋起一股黑色的悸動。在這股無形的力量推動下，我不由自主地轉過身摟住了父親的脖子，當着那麼多認識和不認識的工作人員的面就哭了起來，淚水像溪水般不停地流出。
父親靜靜地摟着我，一隻手輕輕地拍着我的背，任時間分分秒秒地流逝，一句話也沒說。
過了好一會兒我才克制住自己，哽嚥着，不知為什麼突然冒出了一句話：「爸爸……你，你可一定……一定要等着我回來啊！……」
父親慈愛地說：「當然嘛，當然嘛！」
他看着我淚流滿面地上了車，直到汽車開出很遠，還在向我揮動着手臂。
突然間，我發現父親蒼老了許多，慈祥的臉上似乎有一絲抹不去的惆悵，單薄的身軀顯得那樣淒涼，流逝的歲月無情地蠶食了父親那生動的表情和不倦的身影。
隨着汽車漸漸遠去，我極力在視野裡尋找着他，可離別竟是那樣迅速。我暗下決心，一定要想辦法盡快買一台攝像機，記錄下日常生活中真實、熱情和充滿活力的父親。沒有想到的是，這樣一個小小的心願，竟沒有在父親在世時實現。
回到北京，我仍無法擺脫那種被稱作心靈感應的陰影，它使即將在我面前展現的未知的西方世界變得興味索然……
至今我們還無法解釋第六感，也無法破譯這種人體信息，它實在太神秘，神秘得連它的存在都變得可疑。但我確確實實地感知到了。
我黯然神傷地飛向了大洋彼岸，卻把一顆心沉甸甸地墜在了中國。
我在1989年3月3日抵達美國西北部的海濱城市西雅圖，如約到健康和醫療服務中心（後改名為PeaceHealth）進修。
根據中華醫學會與這家中心的交流協議，醫學會每年派出一名從事管理的女性，到那裡進行為期一年的培訓，學習醫院和醫療管理。我是學會派出的第二名進修人員，住在擁有這家醫療服務中心的教會的集體宿舍裡，和一群大多是退休的修女們生活在一起。
這所美國天主教會的慈善機構宿舍，坐落在風光旖旎的西雅圖湖畔。那在微風中蕩漾的藍寳石色湖水，碧草間綴滿五彩繽紛花朵的林間小路，躡步輕行的現代修女，余暉晚照的湖邊木椅……一切一切都浸透着濾盡塵世俗念的宗教式的靜謐。
然而，它這有如世紀般漫長的寧靜，很快就被我打破了。
那是當地時間4月7日晚上，我忽然心緒煩亂，坐在宿舍裡讀不下書，跑到起居室看不進電視和報紙；走進地下室的琴房，將一首首鋼琴曲彈得雜亂無章；轉到湖邊散步，又感覺渾身倦怠……整晚都坐臥不安，神不守舍，惶惶然似不可終日。
當我漫無目的地走進餐廳坐下喝茶時，一位嬤嬤像雲朵似的輕飄過來。她好像發現了我的失態，用聖母般溫柔的細聲問道：「親愛的，最近家裡來信了嗎？」
這再平常不過的問候和輕柔的話語，不知道是怎麼搞的，竟像一道開啟了的閘門，使我一下子淚如雨下，止不住地哭了起來。
坐在其他桌旁喝茶的修女們見狀，紛紛走過來勸我。可我還是控制不住自己，淚雨漣漣地居然哭了一個多小時，才神情恍惚地回到自己住的房間。進屋還沒坐下，電話就響了。
我愛人操着儘可能平靜的語調從太平洋彼岸告訴我：「爸爸病了，現住在北京醫院。」
我馬上截住他的話，急切地問：「是心臟病嗎？是不是需要我馬上回去？」
他沒有正面回答我。或許是怕我再追問下去，他匆匆挂斷了電話……我從木然中清醒過來，放下電話，急匆匆提筆給家裡寫信。
第二天一早家信發出後，我的情緒竟突然如這幽靜的修道院般平靜下來，直至14日黃昏。
那是西雅圖一個景色秀麗的日暮時分，為了緩解一天學習的緊張，我像往常一樣，飯後沿着湖畔散步。可是走着走着，那似曾相識的煩躁不安，竟鬼使神差地又出現了。
我兩腿酸軟，順勢坐在草地上，淚水泉湧般奪眶而出。初春的料峭寒意，使無聲的淚水像冰雪似的冷卻着我的心；人也像被凍住了似的呆坐在落日的黃昏裡，直到夜幕降臨。
好容易平靜下來，剛回到宿舍，我愛人的電話又來了。他急火火地說：「媽媽要你馬上趕回來！」
當時正是晚上9點多鐘，後來我換算了一下西雅圖與北京的時差，那會兒正是父親的心臟猝然停止跳動的時候。
如同千萬隻蜂蠅同時振動起它們的翅膀，我的腦子裡頓時嗡聲一片。

胡耀邦病危領事館刁難

胡耀邦的女兒滿妹還在書中透露，在她父親病危時，她遭到中共駐舊金山領事館的刁難。書中稱，滿妹接到父親病危的消息後，當即撥通中共駐舊金山領事館的電話，找總領事。
接電話的人嗓音倦怠，極不耐煩地說：「現在已是星期五晚上10點多鐘了，你知道嗎？都下班了！」
她解釋說：「我是中華醫學會的副秘書長，是受組織的委派赴美學習的。我家裡出事兒了，希望能得到幫助，盡快回國。」
「自己想辦法吧。如果每個回國的人都找我們幫忙，那領事館就別幹事了。」對方冷冷地答道。她不知所措，忙問：「總領事什麼時候回來？我能過一會兒再打電話嗎？」
「不行！」她生怕他掛斷電話，趕緊又補上一句：「是國內讓我與總領事聯繫的，你看我什麼時候可以找到他？」「你不知道週末不辦公嗎？星期一再說吧。」電話還是啪的一聲掛斷了。
第二天，中共駐舊金山領事館的一官員打來了電話：「聽說你需要幫忙，我們能為你做點兒什麼？」並說昨晚那人不知背景。
滿妹本已平靜的心，頓時像打翻了五味瓶，不知是酸甜還是苦辣。她強捺着性子，對着話筒沒好氣地慢慢答道：「有這個必要嗎？難道我們在國外的中國人，非得有背景才能得到自己政府的幫助？」

Before Hu Yaobang’s death, her daughter perceives the mysterious sixth sense.

05 Nov 2019, 08:53

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Psychologists believe that the so-called ""sixth sense"" is a momentary and direct prediction of the human body. According to statistics, in terms of the sixth sense, the correct rate of women is generally greater than that of men. Hu Yaobang’s daughter mentioned in her memoirs that before her father’s death, she perceives the mysterious sixth sense. “It’s too mysterious, mysterious and even its existence has become suspicious. But I did feel it.”
Hu Yaobang's daughter, full sister, wrote ""The Missing Is Still Endless - Recalling Father Hu Yaobang"" wrote: Just a few days after New Year's Day in 1989, my father's security secretary called me and talked about his father's multiple questions. What is the girl busy now, is it going to go abroad soon?
I know that my father must have thought about me. Then I took a job that I had already done almost the same. I asked the unit for a few days of annual leave and rushed to Changsha. I wanted to chat with my father and take a walk before I left.
I lived with my parents for 3 days. I said to my father, ""Dad, I have to go back to Beijing. Before going abroad, the medical association will hold the 20th National Congress of the National Congress. I am responsible for the documents and conference organization of the conference. In addition, there are also some Work must be accounted for.""
I didn't expect my father to be uncharacteristically insisting that I would not let me go. I said, ""There are many people in the meeting, there is no shortage of you!"" Then I asked, ""Have you been to Guangxi?""
I replied slyly: ""I have been there once in the early 80s.""
The father smiled. ""Hey, that was still a few years ago. Now Guangxi has changed a lot, let's go and see it!""
In fact, I don’t want to spend more time with him! So I discussed with my father, I went to the afternoon of Nanning.
The father stunned and asked: ""So urgent?"" He paused and said, ""Well, well, let's go and leave!""
On the train, I happily swayed with my parents for a day, and it was already the next day at Nanning. After watching everyone settle down and staying, they arrived at the time to say goodbye to them.
I still vividly remember that my father was wearing a dark-skinned tunic suit and a navy blue coat. He and my mother came out to send me, walking in front of the mother and a group of staff. The two of us walked side by side. He had a cigarette between his right finger and silently sent me to the car outside the hotel.
He was smiling all the way, but his eyes were filled with sadness that I had never seen before. At this moment, I seem to have sensed some kind of uninformed human body information, and the body has a black sway. Driven by this invisible force, I couldn't help but turn around and cover my father's neck. In front of so many people who knew and didn't know, I cried, and the tears flowed like streams.
The father stared at me quietly, one hand gently patted my back, letting time pass by every second, without saying a word.
After a while, I restrained myself and choked. I don’t know why I suddenly came up with a sentence: ""Dad...you, you must... must wait for me to come back!...""
Father said kindly: ""Of course, of course!""
He watched me burst into tears and got into the car until the car was far away and still waving my arm.
Suddenly, I found that my father was a lot older, and there seemed to be a lingering shackle on the kind face. The thin body seemed so desolate, and the passing years ruthlessly eroded his father's vivid expression and tireless figure.
As the car drifted away, I tried to find him in the field of vision, but it was so quick to leave. I made up my mind that I must find a way to buy a video camera as soon as possible to record the true, warm and energetic father in daily life. Unexpectedly, such a small wish was not realized when his father was alive.
Back in Beijing, I still can't get rid of the shadow called telepathy, which makes the unknown Western world that will be presented in front of me become interesting...
So far we have not been able to explain the sixth sense, nor can we decipher this kind of human body information. It is so mysterious and mysterious that even its existence becomes suspicious. But I did feel it on the ground.
I flew to the other side of the ocean with sorrow, but fell a heavy heart in China.
I arrived in Seattle, a coastal city in the northwestern United States on March 3, 1989, and went to the Health and Medical Service Center (later renamed PeaceHealth) for further study.
According to the exchange agreement between the Chinese Medical Association and the center, the Medical Association sends a woman who manages each year to a one-year training to study hospital and medical management. I was the second fellow to learn to live in, living in a collective dormitory of the church with this medical service center, living with a group of mostly retired nuns.
This American Catholic charity hostel is located on the shores of the picturesque Lake Seattle. The sapphire lake in the breeze, the forest path dotted with colorful flowers, the modern nuns who walked lightly, the lakeside wooden chairs that were late in the evening... everything was soaked in the worldly Religious silence.
However, it has a long silence like a century, and it was quickly broken by me.
It was the evening of April 7th local time. I was suddenly upset, sitting in the dormitory and reading the book, running to the living room and not seeing TV and newspapers. When I walked into the piano room in the basement, I played a piano piece in a mess. Going to the lake for a walk, I feel tired and tired... I sit still all night, and God doesn’t care, it seems like it’s not all day long.
When I walked into the restaurant aimlessly and drank tea, a cockroach like a cloud. She seems to have discovered my gaffe, and asked with a gentle voice of the Virgin: ""Dear, have you recently sent a letter from your home?""
This ordinary greeting and gentle words, I don't know how to do it. It was like a gate that opened, and I suddenly burst into tears and couldn't stop crying.
The nuns who sat at other tables drinking tea saw them and came to persuade me. But I still couldn't control myself, and I actually cried for more than an hour in tears and rain, and I returned to my living room with a look of enthusiasm. The phone rang when the room was not seated.
My lover told me from the other side of the Pacific in the calmest tone: ""My father is ill and is living in a Beijing hospital.""
I immediately intercepted him and eagerly asked, ""Is it a heart disease? Do you need me to go back immediately?""
He did not answer me positively. Perhaps I was afraid that I would follow up again. He hurriedly hang up the phone... I woke up from Muran, put down the phone, and hurriedly wrote a letter to the family.
After the morning letter was issued the next morning, my emotions suddenly calmed down like this quiet monastery until the evening of the 14th.
It was a beautiful sunset in Seattle. In order to ease the tension of studying in the day, I walked along the lake as usual after dinner. But walking and walking, the irritability of the deja vu, the ghosts made the difference again.
My legs are sore, I am sitting on the grass, and the tears are bursting out. The chill of the early spring makes the silent tears cool my heart like ice and snow; people are like being frozen and sitting in the dusk of the setting sun until the night falls.
It’s easy to calm down, just returned to the dormitory, my lover’s phone is coming again. He said in a hurry: ""Mom wants you to come back soon!""
It was at 9 o'clock in the evening. Later, I converted the time difference between Seattle and Beijing. It was the time when my father's heart suddenly stopped beating.
Just as millions of bees flutter their wings at the same time, my mind suddenly screams.

Hu Yaobang's critically ill consulate

Hu Yaobang’s daughter, Quanmei, also revealed in the book that she was martyrdom of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco when her father was in critical condition. The book said that after receiving news that his father was in critical condition, Manmei immediately dialed the phone number of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to find the Consul General.
The person answering the phone was very tired and said impatiently: ""It is already more than 10 o'clock on Friday night. Do you know? They are off work!""
She explained: ""I am the deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Medical Association. I was appointed by the organization to study in the United States. I have a problem at home, I hope I can get help and return to China as soon as possible.""
""Look at it yourself. If everybody who returns to China asks us for help, then the consulate will not be an officer."" The other party replied coldly. She was at a loss and was busy asking: ""When is the Consul General coming back? Can I call again after a while?""
""No!"" She was afraid that he would hang up the phone and quickly added another sentence: ""I was in contact with the Consul General in the country. When can I find him?"" ""Don't you know that you are not working on the weekend? Let me talk on Monday."" The phone hangs up with a bang.
The next day, an official of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco called: ""I heard that you need help, can we do something for you?"" and said that the person didn't know the background last night.
The full-hearted girl has calmed her heart, and suddenly she has knocked over the five-flavored bottle. I don’t know if it is sweet or sour. She forced her temper and replied slowly to the microphone. ""Is this necessary? Is it true that Chinese people abroad have to have a background to get help from their own government?""
