      <h2>Arsenal spent a club-record £75million to sign Nicolas Pepe in the summer in a bid to strengthen their attack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:33:16+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery made a mistake signing Nicolas Pepe in the summer instead of Harry Maguire.</p>
      <p>That's according to Charlton boss Lee Bowyer, who reckons it would have made much more sense for the Gunners to have signed a top centre-back rather than another forward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> signing Pepe came as a surprise this summer as the club parted with a record £75million to make the transfer happen.</p>
      <p>The Gunners - who did not have the budget to compete with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - pulled off the transfer by agreeing to pay Lille in installments.</p>
      <p>Maguire, meanwhile, signed for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in a deal worth £80million.</p>

      <p>But Bowyer believes it would have made more sense Arsenal going for the centre-back, as they still look shaky at the back.</p>
      <p>"Defensively they are frail, they concede too many goals. Their centre-halves have been a problem for years," said Bowyer on Sky Sports' The Debate.</p>
      <p>"It's not just been this season, it's been for a while now, but they would rather spend £75million on a winger than a centre-back.</p>

      <p>"Maguire would have been perfect for them, why didn't they get him?"</p>
      <p>Arsenal did part with £8million to sign David Luiz from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea,</a> but the Brazilian has done little to shore things up defensively.</p>
