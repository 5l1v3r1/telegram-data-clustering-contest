      <p>From residential homes and commercial buildings to interiors and landscape designs, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> helps architects breathe life into their 3D models and invite others to see the beauty in their designs.</p>
      <p>Architectural rendering and visualization have become crucial tools in the art of communication. From client presentations to internal design reviews, showing your 3D models in lifelike, beautiful environments can convey both practical information about the project’s development, as well as the feeling and experience of a space.</p>
      <p>With the release of <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> 10, available today, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> builds on its tradition of making 3D rendering a stress-free part of architectural workflows. Simply imagine how you want to show your design and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> 10 can help you quickly bring that vision to life.</p>
      <p>With new features and tools, it’s easier than ever to communicate residential and commercial exteriors in their richly detailed settings, cast interiors in a beautiful interplay of light and shadow, and develop living environments for landscapes and cityscapes.</p>

      <p>Ten versions of <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a>. A decade of reliable, intuitive rendering software. Made especially for you — the architect.</p>
      <h3>Brief overview of what’s new in <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> 10</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Fine-detail nature models</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new <i>Fine-detail Nature</i> models in <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> 10 are the most detail-rich, beautiful 3D tree and plant models available in the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> content library.</p>

      <p>With trees, bushes, shrubs and more, these models will visually enrich your scene with life. They can help you imagine the feeling of leaves fluttering in the wind or the rough texture of bark. Place one in front of a home, building or park design, and others will see how your design connects with its living environment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Displacement mapping</b>
      </p>
      <p>When surfaces contain relief and detail, the materials and your entire design come to life. With the addition of displacement mapping to many materials in <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lumion">Lumion</a> 10, your audience will be able to feel the grain of your chosen wood, the rough surface of bricks, the bumpy texture of gravel.</p>

        <b>New content for creating living spaces and environments</b>
      </p>
      <p>Architecture is viewed by some as the intersection between humanity with the built spaces, and how people experience a building.</p>
