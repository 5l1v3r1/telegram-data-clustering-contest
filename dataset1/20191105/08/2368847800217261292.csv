「醫生反活摘器官組織」獲頒社會正義獎

05 Nov 2019, 08:55

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】一個全球性的醫生組織——「醫生反對活摘器官組織」（簡稱DAFOH），因其針對中國良心犯被非法活摘器官的調查和調查結果，於週日（11月3日）獲頒「特蕾莎修女社會正義獎」（Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice）。
DAFOH成立於2006年，該組織目前在全球擁有二百多名醫生，他們反對中共活摘人體器官的殘酷行徑。2016年，DAFOH因其十年來在提高對活摘器官的認識方面的努力而獲諾貝爾和平獎提名。
DAFOH認為，中國已成為器官移植的中心。在中國，被非法活摘器官的受害群體主要是法輪功學員。
法輪功是佛家修煉法門之一。九十年代，該功法吸引了7,000萬至1億人修煉。從1999年開始，中國共產黨將法輪功視為威脅，並開始對其進行鎮壓。
據《印度人報》（The Hindu）報導，DAFOH創辦人、執行主任托斯坦·特雷（Torsten Trey）醫生說，「二十多年來，中國（中共）政府參與了對法輪功學員的大規模迫害。」「中共把他們送往勞教所，在那裡他們挨餓，遭受酷刑、洗腦，並成為中共活摘器官的對像。」
「雖然官方政府數據記錄了每年10,000至15,000例器官移植，但根據一組現場研究人員的說法，實際估計超過60,000例。器官的一般等待期是兩個星期。如果病人支付10,000美元，等待期可能只有兩天，」特雷醫生說，「同時，他們估計合法捐贈器官的數量在六年之內不到130個。」
他補充說：「我們看到了一家中國醫院，該醫院每年進行2,000次肝移植。這個數字是令人難以置信的，尤其是在器官捐贈率較低的國家。」
中國器官移植業吸引了來自韓國、日本和中東國家的等待接受器官移植手術的患者。特雷醫生說，中國全國各地都出現了非法活摘器官的案例。
據《印度時報》（The Indian Times）報導，特雷醫生在發言時呼籲全球醫學界密切關注這些數字，以了解這個世界上人口最多的國家的器官捐贈計劃是如何「偽造」出來的。「在他們說2015年不再摘取囚犯器官之後，我們分析了他們的官方程序數據，該數據可從網站上獲得。我們對該網站進行了30個月的監控，發現他們的捐款數量很少。」他說，「突然之間，在2015年12月30日，我們看到這一數字在一天之內增長了25,000。2016年12月發生了同樣的事情。但是，在我們寫了一篇論文之後，就再也沒有數字跳躍了。」
特雷醫生在接受《印度快報》（The Indian Express）採訪時表示：「移植外科醫師的數量也在增加。」他說，仍然存在著的一個主要問題是，被拘留的法輪功學員下落不明。「很難追蹤到他們是否是因為被摘取器官而被殺死的。他們的家人不知道他們人在哪裡。」
特雷還談到，雖然聯合國對中共活摘器官的行徑保持沉默，「但我們正在獲得國際社會的支持。在過去的五年中，有三百萬簽名請願調查（中共的）種族滅絕罪行。」
特雷醫生認為，全世界的人們都應該對此發出反對聲音。「它（中共活摘器官事件）應該使您成為世界公民。如果我們只是坐下來觀望這件事，說這不是我的國家的事，那我們都是犯罪的同謀。我們需要改變思維方式。我們應該進行討論，並提高意識以實現變革。」
他表示，中共活摘法輪功學員器官，旨在剷除法輪功。但是，法輪功學員因活摘器官被殺死的人數越多，世界就越需要知道法輪功是好的。如果對法輪功修煉的支持呼聲成倍增加，那麼中共活摘器官的根本目的就落敗了，人們就會從根本上製止這種嚴重的人權侵犯行徑。
今年6月，DAFOH的調查結果得到了一個名為「中國法庭」的獨立人民法庭的支持，該法庭根據證人的證詞確定了中國的器官摘取計劃中存在「種族滅絕因素」。「中國（中共）政府一直在有系統地消滅法輪功學員。他們被殺害的原因主要是強取他們的肝臟、腎臟，還有心臟，肺和眼睛。」特雷醫生說。
和睦基金會創辦人、主席亞伯拉罕·馬泰伊（Abraham Mathai）週日將「特雷莎修女紀念獎」頒給特雷醫生，馬泰伊說，印度需要制定一個嚴格的法律，以遏制非法器官捐贈和器官販賣的行為。
在和睦國際會議上，一位與會者問及他可以做些什麼？特雷醫生的答覆獲得了熱烈的掌聲。「這是一個例子，如果每個人都了解這一事實，並通過向中國國家主席郵寄一張簡單的明信片，寫上以下字樣來幫助闡明這些危害人類罪：『法輪功很好，停止活摘法輪功學員的器官』。」特雷醫生說，就像特蕾莎修女的一生所創造出的連鎖反應一樣，每個人都可以採取行動，制止危害人類罪。
「特雷莎修女社會正義獎」是印度財團創立的一個獎項，獎給為人類做出卓越貢獻的個人或團體。其它獲獎者還包括諾貝爾獎獲得者凱拉西·薩塔亞提（Kailash Satyarthi）、非營利組織Impulse的創始人哈西娜·哈比（Hasina Khabhih）、英國非營利組織「戰爭兒童」（War Child）的首席執行官羅伯·威廉姆斯（Rob Williams）等。

""Doctor Reversing Organs Organisation"" Awarded Social Justice Award

05 Nov 2019, 08:55

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] A global doctor organization, ""Doctors Against Live Organs"" (DAFOH), was investigated and investigated for the illegal harvesting of organs by Chinese conscience. On Sunday (November 3), he was awarded the Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice.
Founded in 2006, DAFOH currently has more than 200 doctors around the world who oppose the CCP's cruel acts of picking up human organs. In 2016, DAFOH was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for its ten years of efforts to raise awareness of live organ harvesting.
DAFOH believes that China has become the center of organ transplantation. In China, the victims of illegally harvesting organs are mainly Falun Gong practitioners.
Falun Gong is one of the Buddhist practice methods. In the 1990s, the practice attracted 70 to 100 million people to practice. Since 1999, the Chinese Communist Party has regarded Falun Gong as a threat and began to suppress it.
According to The Hindu, Dr. Torsten Trey, founder and executive director of DAFOH, said: ""For more than two decades, the Chinese (CCP) government has participated in the large-scale participation of Falun Gong practitioners. Persecution."" ""The CCP sent them to labor camps where they were hungry, tortured, brainwashed, and became the object of the CCP's live organ harvesting.""
""Although official government data records 10,000 to 15,000 organ transplants per year, according to a group of field researchers, the actual estimate is over 60,000. The general waiting period for organs is two weeks. If the patient pays $10,000, the waiting period may be Only two days,"" Dr. Trey said. ""At the same time, they estimated that the number of legally donated organs was less than 130 in six years.""
He added: ""We have seen a Chinese hospital that conducts 2,000 liver transplants a year. This number is incredible, especially in countries with low organ donation rates.""
The Chinese organ transplant industry has attracted patients from South Korea, Japan and the Middle East who are waiting for an organ transplant. Dr. Trey said that there have been cases of illegal live organ harvesting throughout China.
According to The Indian Times, Dr. Trey called on the global medical community to pay close attention to these figures to understand how the organ donation program in the world's most populous country is “forged”. ""After they said that they did not pick up the prisoner's organs in 2015, we analyzed their official program data, which is available on the website. We monitored the site for 30 months and found that their donations were small. ""Suddenly, on December 30, 2015, we saw that this number increased by 25,000 in one day. The same thing happened in December 2016. However, we wrote an article. After the paper, there are no more numbers to jump.""
In an interview with The Indian Express, Dr. Trey said: ""The number of transplant surgeons is also increasing."" He said that one of the main problems still remains that the whereabouts of Falun Gong practitioners in detention are unknown. ""It's hard to tell if they were killed because they were picked up. Their family doesn't know where they are.""
Trey also said that although the United Nations remains silent on the CCP's live organ harvesting process, ""but we are receiving the support of the international community. In the past five years, three million signature petitions have been investigated (the CCP's) genocide. ""
Dr. Trey believes that people all over the world should be opposed to this. ""It (the CCP's live organ harvesting incident) should make you a citizen of the world. If we just sit down and watch this and say that this is not my country's business, then we are all accomplices of crime. We need to change our way of thinking. We It should be discussed and awareness raised to achieve change.""
He said that the CCP is picking up organs from Falun Gong practitioners and aiming to eradicate Falun Gong. However, the more people Falun Gong practitioners are killed by organ harvesting, the more the world needs to know that Falun Gong is good. If the voice of support for Falun Gong cultivation increases exponentially, then the fundamental purpose of the CCP's live organ harvesting will be defeated, and people will fundamentally stop this serious human rights violation.
In June of this year, DAFOH's findings were supported by an independent people's court called the ""Chinese Court"", which determined the existence of ""genocidal factors"" in China's organ harvesting plan based on witness testimony. ""The Chinese (CCP) government has been systematically eliminating Falun Gong practitioners. The main reason for their killing is to take their liver, kidneys, heart, lungs and eyes,"" Dr. Trey said.
Abraham Mathai, the founder and chairman of the Peace Foundation, presented the ""Mr. Teresa Memorial Award"" to Dr. Trey on Sunday. Matai said that India needs to enact a strict law to curb illegal organ donation. And the act of organ trafficking.
At the International Conference of Peace and Harmony, a participant asked what he could do? Dr. Trey’s reply received warm applause. ""This is an example. If everyone understands this fact and writes a simple postcard to the Chinese President, write the following words to help clarify these crimes against humanity: ""Falungong is very good, stop taking live Falun Gong practitioners. ""The organ,"" Dr. Trey said, just like the chain reaction created by Mother Teresa's life, everyone can take action to stop crimes against humanity.
The Mother Teresa Social Justice Award is an award created by the Indian consortium to award individuals or groups who have made outstanding contributions to humanity. Other winners include Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi, founder of non-profit Impulse, Hasina Khabhih, and British non-profit organization War Children ( War Child) CEO Rob Williams and so on.
