      <p>Xiaomi CC9 Pro Launched with a curved display &amp; 108MP penta-lens: The price is mind blowing<br/>4.7 (94%) 10 votes</p>
      <p>As widely announced, Chinese manufacturing giant, Xiaomi, has finally released the world’s first 108MP smartphone, Xiaomi CC9 Pro. Much of the details of this device have actually hit the web so it was not a surprise to us. However, its 2,799 Yuan (~$399) starting price is completely mind-blowing. Its 108MP Penta-lens, curved display, huge 5260 mAh battery, and SD730G SoC means that this device is way cheaper than what it holds.</p>

      <h3>Design &amp; Appearance</h3>
      <p>The Xiaomi CC9 Pro comes with a new slightly curved display design. When there is an incoming call or notification, the curves on the display will emit dazzling lights. This gives the phone a premium and cool appearance. It boasts of a hyperbolic waterdrop 6.47-inch AMOLED display with a 1080 x 2340 pixels full HD+ resolution and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. It also offers 400000:1 contrast ratio, HDR and DCI-P3 wide color gamut. The CC9 Pro comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on both front and back. The display has TUV Rheinland certification which means that its blue-ray effect is completely harmless. In addition, it uses an on-screen fingerprint scanner for biometric authentification.</p>

      <p>To keep its lights on is a 5260 mAh battery which supports 30W fast charge. Although Xiaomi has a few phones with a higher battery size (e.g. Mi Max 3 – 5500 mAh), the 30W fast charge of the CC9 Pro’s 5260mAh batter makes it better. Although the power does not seem to be large, it can fully charge in 65 minutes.</p>
      <h3>Camera</h3>
