      <p>A photo showing Delhi BJP chief and Lok Sabha MP <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Manoj-Tiwari">Manoj Tiwari</a> burning a firework is being shared with a claim that despite rising pollution in Delhi, Tiwari indulged in burning fireworks.</p>
      <p>A Facebook page that goes by the name 'I.T &amp; Social Media Cell Congress' shared the photo with a caption in Hindi that loosely translates to, "This is Manoj Tiwari, MP Northeast Delhi. He's busy burning firecrackers. Despite Delhi's current situation, he has no mercy. We feel ashamed that the people of Delhi chose him as an MP."</p>

      <p>Below the photo showing Tiwari burning what looks like a firework known popularly as 'Fountain' is a screengrab of a tweet made by Tiwari from his verified Twitter handle. The tweet, in Hindi, translates to, "My eyes are burning in Delhi today. Yours?"</p>
      <p>Journalist Shahbaz Ansar tweeted two photos of Tiwari. The first one shows Tiwari wearing a pollution mask and the second one is the same one showing him burning a firework. Sharing these two photos, Ansar said what translates to, "On one hand, Manoj Tiwari observes a fast against pollution, and on the other hand, his twin brother could be seen bursting crackers. May no one get such a useless brother."</p>
