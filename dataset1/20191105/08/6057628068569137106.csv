Security forces clash with protesters in Iraq
05 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

Iraqi security forces fired bullets at anti-government protesters in Baghdad, hours after killing four protesters outside the Iranian embassy in Karbala.

The clashes are one of the latest tensions in Iraq, with continued protests against the government, which has led to roadblocks and protests against the government over allegations of corruption and unemployment.
Some protesters threw rocks at security forces, while officials responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
At least 20 people have been injured in Baghdad, according to hospital authorities, while four have arrived at our residence in Karbala.
A total of 270 people have been killed since the protests broke out on the 24th of July.
