江澤民令計劃共享情婦？盤點中南海九大淫棍

05 Nov 2019, 08:11

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】自江澤民腐敗治國開始，中國社會道德急劇下滑，官場色情泛濫。日前，媒體翻出中南海九大淫棍的醜聞，這些大淫棍從副國級到正國級，大多是江澤民直接培植的鐵桿親信，更離譜的是江竟然還與淫棍之一的令計劃共享情婦。

一，江澤民帶頭淫亂

江澤民主政時期色情治國，帶頭淫亂，官場「床上培養女幹部」的風氣，被指始於江澤民。公開報導中江有四大情婦：宋祖英、李瑞英、黃麗滿、陳至立，全都憑藉江獲得重用。
江最愛的情婦宋祖英官至海軍政治部文工團團長，享受正軍級待遇。
江另一情婦陳至立，先後被江提拔為上海市委宣傳部長、教育部長、國務委員、中共人大副委員長，官至副國級。
曾任江澤民祕書的黃麗滿，在江上台後，先後被江提拔為深圳市委副祕書長、祕書長、廣東省委副書記併兼任深圳市委書記、廣東省人大主任，官至正省級。
四大情婦之末李瑞英，則只任中共央視新聞中心播音部副主任。

宋祖英貼身女兵小美（化名），曾向海外媒體披露江澤民在軍中玩弄文工團女性的內幕。
這位女兵跟隨宋祖英五年多，直到近年才退伍回地方工作。在和宋祖英生活的幾年中，她從宋祖英口中得知「江澤民的私生活是多麼荒淫！」
小美說，「北京軍區和海軍的文工團，多數想提乾的女戰士，都要被江澤民篩選一番，也就是由江澤民安插在部隊的人員把照片送到江辦，江覺得順眼就召其到住所，在一夜淫亂後如果覺得意猶未盡，還可能多次傳喚，直到膩為止。」
「而江提拔的高幹們，則從那些江沒有挑中的女戰士中，隨意挑選作為淫慾發泄的工具，其中不乏家庭背景雄厚但迫於軍方權力大而屈服的女戰士。多數女戰士都選擇了退伍，並且也會收到數十萬的掩口費。
能夠留下來的女戰士，只要走一下形式通過了考試，就能夠順利地被提升為幹部。如果哪位長期被高官寵幸，在兩年內可從中尉升至少校，甚至是中校，當中黑幕不用多說了。」
小美畢業於中國最頂尖的影視戲劇學院，天生麗質，被招入海政歌舞團。機緣湊巧成為宋祖英的貼身女兵，跟隨宋祖英輾轉各地演出，在生活和工作中都是宋的好幫手。
眼見軍中腐敗和江澤民迫害人權的狀況，她覺得不能再昧着良心隱藏真相，所以向海外媒體披露軍中文工團的腐敗實況。
在平常和宋祖英幾年的工作生活中，小美觀察到「一旦宋祖英聽聞江的消息，眼神會詭異地變化，可能他們有一些不為人知的事情，過多的也不得而知」。
1990年，尚未成名的宋祖英第一次登上「春晚」舞台，唱了一首《小背簍》，被爺爺輩的江澤民相中。領導慰問演員時，江澤民握着宋祖英的手兩眼放光，痴痴地不放手，有照片為證。
次年宋祖英被調入中共軍隊海政歌舞團任獨唱演員，從此江澤民常常光顧海政，並偷偷地給宋祖英遞上小紙條「以後有事找大哥」，海政招待所成了兩人時常幽會之地，江宋緋聞逐漸傳遍大江南北。
宋祖英的事業也被江及其馬仔捧上頂峰，連續24年在「春晚」獻唱，國內外各種榮譽紛沓而來。

二，令計劃27名情婦 李瑞英在列

2016年7月4日，中共官方通報前中共中央辦公廳主任、政協副主席、中央統戰部長令計劃涉及的受賄、非法獲取國家祕密、濫用職權案作出一審宣判，判處其無期徒刑。
通報中並沒有令計劃與一眾大老虎共有的權色交易等罪名，但2015年7月20日，當局通報開除令計劃開除黨籍和公職處分時提及，令「與多名女性通姦，進行權色交易」。
港媒引述海外傳媒指，令計劃自1999年10月升任中辦調研室主任後，長期以考察或巡視中央駐地為名，到高級會所玩弄女性；且令偷情極具規律，平均每週兩次。有傳令有27名情婦，其中7人更是定期同居，分別為令誕下5名隨母姓的私生子。令計劃更被指患性病。
與令計劃「通姦」的多名女性中，流傳最廣的是央視時政新聞部副主任馮卓。早在2005年，央視內部已流傳馮卓是令計劃情人之說。2014年9月起馮卓失聯，疑因捲入令案被有關部門帶走調查。
據《中國密報》引述央視內部消息披露，令計劃在央視有不止一個情人，其中央視財經頻道美女主播歐陽智薇神祕「失蹤」，央視《新聞聯播》主播李瑞英2014年5月突然宣布「隱退」，都可能與令計劃有關。
此外，據海外雜誌披露，令計劃任中辦主任期間，在中南海亦有祕密情人，是中南海電話局女話務員，令計劃利用她為其做耳目，監控和收集現任和離任高層的情況。

三，曾慶紅惦記宋祖英，江澤民急了

曾慶紅被指是江澤民的「狗頭軍師」、「大內總管」。據多家海外中文媒體報導，中南海第一大皮條客是曾慶紅的胞弟曾慶淮，宋祖英在投到江澤民懷抱之前，一直是曾慶紅的小情人，就是由曾慶淮撮合的。
報導說，宋祖英投靠江澤民後，曾慶紅借幫宋祖英海外發展事業之機，在江、宋之間插過幾槓子。宋祖英為了抓住花心老江，以此挑動老江極強的妒忌心，江真急了，對曾慶紅耿耿於懷。
東莞號稱「中國性都」。據報，曾慶紅「情陷東莞、樂不思京」。退休後，一年至少有10個月，都是「靜居性都綠蔭深處某別墅」，享受着當地馬仔的「侍奉」。
曾慶紅還有個綽號是「中國最雄偉的」，源於他在67歲那年，在東北某處赤身裸體對着淫亂女說：我那活兒是「中國最雄偉的」！過程被人偷拍。
陸媒曾載文，特意提到了清末貪官慶親王奕劻的淫邪、腐敗之事。外界普遍解讀當代的「慶親王」就是曾慶紅。

四，「百雞王」周永康

中共前政治局常委、政法委書記周永康，有「百雞王」之稱，周因玩弄、強姦婦女被舉報，還因誘奸中共少將之妻，一度驚動中南海，高層有人曾當面怒斥其：早晚死在女人身上。
2012年中共前重慶市委書記薄熙來落馬後，媒體披露，周永康長期接受薄熙來提供的女人，其中28名已經確認，包括歌手、女演員以及大學女生。
周永康僅在北京就有6處「行宮」可以淫樂。同時，周永康還被傳與薄熙來、中央軍委副主席徐才厚等高官共享情婦軍中女歌手湯燦。
除了與薄熙來等人共用情婦，周還與薄熙來的妻子谷開來有一腿。據披露，谷開來供認，她是薄熙來與周永康政變的信息傳遞人。她罵周是「壞蛋」，在她身上「佔便宜」……
周永康還有個癖好，喜歡與同僚或下屬交換女人，為拉攏下屬，還會將其上過的女性，轉贈下屬。
香港《文匯報》記者曾披露，周永康至少睡過400位女性，其中不乏一線女星、女演員及女大學生等各行業美女！
2013年12月，前中共公安部副部長李東生落馬後，他為周永康「扯皮條」，周的第二任妻子、前央視記者賈曉燁，就是李東生任央視副台長時，性賄賂周的「禮物」。
後來，周永康為迎娶小他28歲的賈曉燁，不惜指使手下製造車禍，將前妻撞死，並於2001年與賈結婚。李東生為周「扯皮條」醜聞還扯出眾多央視美女主播、主持人與高官及高官夫人有染，央視變成高官的「後宮」。
有消息稱，賈曉燁是江澤民的外甥女。憑着這層裙帶關係，特別是周永康傍着江澤民殘酷迫害法輪功學員的政績，周獲得江的極大信任，把持中央政法委書記高位多年，有「維穩沙皇」之稱。

五，薄熙來被曝情婦有170人

中共元老薄一波的兒子薄熙來，資歷不深，來頭不小，加之他上竄下跳愛折騰，所以，名氣挺大。更駭人聽聞，他淫亂時咬掉女方乳頭。2012年網民把他列為「人渣」第一。
說起薄熙來的淫亂習性，與他老爸不無干係。薄一波官至中共副總理，把女祕書胡明，也就是薄熙來生母，搞得三次流產。元配夫人對薄一波有救命之恩，實在受不了了，忍氣吞聲讓位於小三，這才有了薄熙來。
而薄熙來與其父如出一撤，有了老婆孩子，又勾搭上谷開來，於是有了薄瓜瓜。薄熙來與原配離婚，孩子判給了老婆，薄熙來對法院判決的撫養費，一分錢也不肯掏。
薄熙來任大連市長期間，爆出咬爛大連女模特于某乳頭的醜聞。于某丈夫是黑社會頭子，當時正在監獄服刑。
下台後的江澤民，為了維持對法輪功的迫害，陰謀政變，扳倒習近平，讓薄熙來取而代之。作為江系內定的接班人，2007年，薄空降重慶，「唱紅打黑」，大造聲勢。
薄熙來儼然一個土皇上，美女如雲。儘管如此，薄熙來大連還保留5處行宮，隨時方便之用。薄熙來落馬後，除了被曝強姦幼女，還被曝情婦有170人之多，其中還包括11名未滿16週歲的未成年少女，以及知名影星、歌星等。

六，羅干專睡官員老婆

中共官場上的人都知道，中共前政治局常委、政法委書記羅干非常陰壞，他掌握公檢法大權時，官場上誰有意無意得罪了他，他都想辦法把人送進監獄，但從始至終他都不會露面。
羅乾的陰壞，不僅用在整人上，還用在玩人上。求他辦事的人都知道，羅干錢太多了，他不要錢，要送女人。有人送二奶，或花錢雇女人去，會被羅干認為其誠意不大，一睡了之，睡完並不辦事。
後來求他辦事的人慢慢才納過悶來，原來羅干要睡人家正牌老婆！有些人雖然拍桌子大罵，最後沒辦法還得把老婆送去潛規則。
胡耀邦的祕書林牧曾說，羅干本性就是一個反動的法西斯分子，政法口做的壞事都是他乾的！凡是那些惡性事件的背後都有他的黑手。這個人壞透了！根本不夠人的資格，豺狼虎豹！
2005年12月，北京著名人權律師高智晟，給當政的胡、溫寫了三封信，揭露羅干主管下的「610」人員及警察，完全程式化的幾無例外的，針對女性生殖器攻擊的下流行徑！

七，徐才厚被指「色情狂」

2015年3月15日，中央軍委原副主席徐才厚，因膀胱尿路癌致多器官功能衰竭死亡。但在內部披露：徐才厚真正死因是愛滋病並發症。
中共上將劉亞洲曾在國防大學發表講話時說：谷俊山給徐才厚獻了女歌星、獻了女演員、獻了女服務員，這還不算，他居然把自己的女兒獻給了徐才厚。
劉亞洲嘲諷：「更令我感到『敬佩』的是，徐才厚和他女兒在裡面巫山雲雨的時候，谷俊山就在外屋坐著。」
據報，徐才厚家中藏有一噸多巨款，還在「八一大樓」地下祕密儲藏室放著大量現金，由祕書和一名負責勤衛女兵看管，徐才厚霸佔了這名女兵，許諾提幹升職，遲遲沒有兌現。
徐才厚退休後，女兵絕望了。有一天，她從山東老家開來一輛廂型車，把徐藏在地下儲藏室裡的現金裝了一整車，連人帶錢一起失蹤。
據中共內部公布的材料指控徐才厚於2000－2012年，違規破格提拔、安置80多名女性在國防、軍事部門任職，其中不少女性是被徐日後提拔。
2012－2013年，徐檢查出患有性病，之後，檢查被列為嚴重一級性病後，還給15名曾經與之發生關係，做出過承諾的女性，總值2億2千餘萬現金及市值物業。
據某雜誌披露，徐才厚被查抄資產清單中的第九項，包括：色情盤片、錄像帶1755盤，外國色情雜誌、刊物422本。

八，郭伯雄包養12名情婦

據報，郭伯雄雖年逾古稀，卻依然色的不輕，狼性十足，反腐調查人員在其北京、西安、濟南、珠海等地住所中，搜出500多隻色情光盤，120多本色情雜誌。
郭還曾三次被舉報婚外情，兩次被軍方責令檢查，其中一次被「記大過」處分。另有消息說，郭長期包養12名情婦，凡被他看上的，都會由徐才厚調入戰友歌舞團、戰士歌舞團、前進歌舞團、海政歌舞團等，由其包養，極盡荒淫。
徐才厚和郭伯雄兩人還利用權力利用美色，拉攏大批軍政高官，人數不少於兩位數。

九，孫政才養情婦為「登基」留種

被視為江派推出的中共「接班人」、曾備位「儲君」的中共重慶市前市委書記孫政才，去年5月8日被以受賄罪判終身監禁。
官方通報中，兩次提到他的資金來源主要通過「特定關係人」，進一步印證了此前孫政才通過多名女商人情婦進行權錢色交易的內幕。
在孫政才落馬後，有關其包養了至少6名情婦的內幕曝光，其中有公務員、商人，最受寵的是一名年輕的在校大學生。他還被曝有3個私生子，欲為日後接班「登基」留種。
孫政才還曾將習近平當局劃撥用於「一帶一路」計劃的資金10億元人民幣，匯給情婦以撫養私生子。孫政才佩戴多種名錶、其妻胡穎是民生銀行「高官夫人俱樂部」成員。
港媒曾披露，孫政才情婦之一女商人劉鳳洲，為孫請了一套龍袍。孫政才把龍袍掛在家中的一個空置房間裡，孫只要在家，每天都會去拜龍袍。
報導說，孫政才一路腐敗淫亂，卻連續11年被評為「優秀黨員」，並先後獲得「風流區委書記」、「風流省委書記」等多個花名，但仍然一路晉升。

事實上，中共各級官員從上到下荒淫無度，包養情婦、育有私生子女，早已是中共官場公開的祕密。近年來，已落馬的中共官員中，有婚外情與私生子的案例頻被曝光。
據中共官方披露，受處分的廳局級幹部中，95%的落馬貪官都包養情人，甚至多個貪官共用一個情人。
中共十八大後，官方通報的省部級落馬官員中，幾乎人人都有「與他人通姦」的行為，這已成為落馬官員罪名中的高頻詞。因此中共被民間諷刺為「通姦黨」。

Jiang Zemin ordered to share mistresses? Counting Zhongnanhai nine kinky sticks

05 Nov 2019, 08:11

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Since Jiang Zemin’s corruption and governance, China’s social morality has fallen sharply, and official pornography has been rampant. A few days ago, the media turned out the scandals of the nine gangsters in Zhongnanhai. These gangsters were from the deputy to the national level. Most of them were hard-hearted cronies directly cultivated by Jiang Zemin, and even more ridiculous was the plan of one of Jiang’s and the sluts. Share mistress.

First, Jiang Zemin takes the lead in fornication

In the period of Jiang Zemin's democratic administration, he was erotic and ruthless, and he led the act of fornication. The officialdom of ""cultivating female cadres in bed"" was accused of starting with Jiang Zemin. Public reports on Zhongjiang have four mistresses: Song Zuying, Li Ruiying, Huang Liman, and Chen Zhili, all of whom have been re-used by Jiang.
Jiang’s favorite mistress, Song Zuying, went to the head of the Naval Political Department’s Cultural and Art Corps to enjoy the military-level treatment.
Jiang’s other mistress, Chen Zhili, was promoted by Jiang to be the Propaganda Minister, Minister of Education, State Councilor, Vice Chairman of the CPC, and to the vice-national level.
Huang Liman, former secretary of Jiang Zemin, was promoted by Jiang as the deputy secretary-general and secretary-general of the Shenzhen Municipal Committee, deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and concurrently the secretary of the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee and the director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.
At the end of the four mistresses, Li Ruiying was only the deputy director of the Broadcasting Department of the CCTV News Center.

Song Zuying’s close-fitting female soldier Xiaomei (a pseudonym) once disclosed to the overseas media that Jiang Zemin was playing inside the army to play with the insiders of the cultural and art troupe.
The female soldier followed Song Zuying for more than five years and only retired to work in the local area in recent years. In the few years of her life with Song Zuying, she learned from Song Zuying that ""How much arrogance Jiang Zemin's private life is!""
Xiaomei said, ""The military corps of the Beijing Military Region and the Navy, most of the female warriors who want to be promoted, must be screened by Jiang Zemin, that is, the personnel inserted by Jiang Zemin in the army sent photos to Jiang, and Jiang felt that he was pleasing to the eye. When you arrive at your home, you may be summoned many times if you feel unsatisfied after a night of fornication, until you get tired.""
""While the high-ranking people who are promoted by Jiang, they are free to choose from the female warriors who are not selected by Jiang as a tool for lust and venting. There are many female warriors who have strong family background but are forced by the military to surrender. Most female warriors. They have chosen to retire and will receive hundreds of thousands of cover fees.
The female warrior who can stay can successfully be promoted to a cadre as long as she passes the exam. If any of them have been favored by senior officials for a long time, they can soar from at least the school or even the lieutenant colonel in two years. ""
Xiaomei graduated from China's top film and television drama school, and was born into the Haizheng Song and Dance Troupe. The chance to become Song Zuying's close female soldier, followed Song Zuying's performances everywhere, is a good helper in life and work.
Seeing the corruption in the army and the situation of Jiang Zemin's persecution of human rights, she felt that she could no longer conceal the truth with her conscience, so she disclosed the corruption of the Chinese-language Chinese Corps to overseas media.
In his usual working life with Song Zuying, Xiaomei observed that ""Once Song Zuying heard the news of Jiang, his eyes would change strangely. Maybe they have some unknown things, and too many are unknown.""
In 1990, Song Zuying, who had not yet become famous, made his debut on the ""Spring Festival Evening"" stage and sang a ""Little Back"", which was met by Jiang Zemin, a grandfather. When the leader condolences to the actor, Jiang Zemin holds Song Zuying’s hand and glares, and he does not let go, and there are photos to prove it.
In the following year, Song Zuying was transferred to the CCP's Haizheng Song and Dance Troupe as a solo performer. Since then, Jiang Zemin has often visited Haizheng and secretly handed a small note to Song Zuying. ""After having something to find a big brother,"" Haizheng Guest House became a frequent rendezvous. The land, the Song and Song dynasties gradually spread throughout the north and south of the river.
Song Zuying’s career was also culminated by Jiang and his Mazi. They sang in the Spring Festival Evening for 24 consecutive years, and various honors came from home and abroad.

Second, the plan of 27 mistresses Li Ruiying is in the list

On July 4, 2016, the CCP officially notified the former Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, the vice chairman of the CPPCC, and the Central United Front Command to accept the bribery, illegal acquisition of state secrets, abuse of power, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.
In the notice, there was no charge for the transaction of the rights and shares that the plan shared with the big tigers. However, on July 20, 2015, the authorities reported that the expulsion order was expelled from the party and public office, and that “the adultery was carried out with a number of women.

There are 27 mistresses in the order, and 7 of them are cohabiting regularly. They are the illegitimate children of the 5 surnames. Make the plan more likely to be sexually transmitted.
Among the many women who have made the plan ""adultery"", the most widely circulated is Feng Zhu, deputy director of the CCTV Political Department. As early as 2005, CCTV has circulated that Feng Zhuo is the lover of the plan. Since September 2014, Feng Zhuo has lost contact, and the suspected involvement in the case was taken away by the relevant departments.
According to ""China Secret"" quoted CCTV internal information disclosure, the plan has more than one lover in CCTV, its central view of the financial channel beauty anchor Ouyang Zhiwei mysterious ""missing"", CCTV ""News Network"" anchor Li Ruiying suddenly announced in May 2014 It may be related to the plan.

Before he was cast in the arms of Jiang Zemin, Song Zuying had been a small lover of Zeng Qinghong, which was composed by Zeng Qinghuai.
According to the report, after Song Zuying joined Jiang Zemin, Zeng Qinghong borrowed a few bars between Jiang and Song to help Song Zuying develop his career overseas. In order to seize the heart of the old river, Song Zuying provoked the strong jealousy of Laojiang. Jiang Zhen was anxious, and he was very worried about Zeng Qinghong.

Zeng Qinghong also has the nickname ""China's most majestic"". It originated from the fact that at the age of 67, he was naked in the northeast and said to the lecherous woman: ""My work is ""the most majestic in China""! The process was taken by people.
