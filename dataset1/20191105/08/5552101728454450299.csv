獨立音樂歌手鄭宜農將於12月6日推出新專輯《給天王星》，並於12月21日在天母體育館舉辦《給天王星》演唱會，如今台語主打歌〈街仔路雨落袂停〉釋出，是因受到蔡振南的鼓勵與影響。
2011年，鄭宜農拍電影《眼淚》時，演一位檳榔西施，還為電影寫了片尾曲〈莎喲娜拉〉，當時，她跟蔡振南有很多對手戲，蔡振南聽了鄭宜農的歌，鼓勵她要多寫台語歌，鄭宜農說：「那時候，我的台語沒有現在這麼好，所以想寫台語歌這個心願放在心裡很久。」
拍〈街仔路雨落袂停〉MV時，為符合歌曲情境，挑了一個大雨夜晚拍攝，期間，一位美女走進片場，讓鄭宜農驚呼是她的好友兼閨密温貞菱，帶了熱熱的紅豆湯來探班，讓鄭宜農感動說：「有一點點想哭的感覺。」
鄭宜農與温貞菱曾合作〈玉仔的心〉MV，兩人是「很能理解對方的朋友」，鄭宜農說：「貞菱是天蠍座，我則是是月亮天蠍座，所以特別契合！不過我太陽是雙魚座，行事風格比較柔軟，相較下來，她的個性比較橫衝直撞，有時候像個小孩子，會讓我們擔心，不過也因此看到她很真實的一面。」鄭宜農《給天王星》演唱會12月21日於台北天母體育館開唱，演唱會門票 iNDIEVOX 開賣中。
