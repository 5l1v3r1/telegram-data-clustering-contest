      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — The Housing and Local Government Ministry acknowledged that some foreign workers have married locals to gain permanent resident status.</p>
      <p>During Question Time, Deputy Minister Datuk Raja Kamarul Bahrin Raja Ahmad this issue was discovered when his ministry was trying to act on foreigners suspected of operating businesses illegally.</p>
      <p>“It is true and accurate that incidents like these are happening and we admit this is a major issue,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, Raja Kamarul it was not his ministry’s jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>“Over the question of them getting married, there is nothing we can do, as this involves people falling in love and is their personal matter,” he said.</p>
      <p>“These marriages open other avenues for them to escape the existing laws, however, from a legal perspective, the Home Ministry will have better knowledge on how to overcome this loophole,” he said.</p>
      <p>Raja Kamarul was responding to Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong (Ayer Hitam-BN), who asked for the ministry’s position on the issue.</p>
      <p>Raja Kamarul said the Cabinet decided on March 29 to form a special committee to monitor the influx of foreign workers and claims foreigners were crowding out local traders.</p>
