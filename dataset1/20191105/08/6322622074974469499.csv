国行维持利率于3%
05 Nov 2019, 08:03 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
（吉隆坡5日讯）国家银行今日维持隔夜政策利率（OPR）不变，因预计今年的经济增长将符合预期，且此步伐将持续到2020年。
但国行警告，这一预测仍面临下行风险，主要由于全球经济和金融状况的不确定性，以及大宗商品相关领域疲弱。
为期了两天的会议结束后，货币政策委员会（MPC）决定维持利率于3%。
“在目前的利率水平，货币政策的立场仍然是宽松和支持经济活动。”
国行在文告中指出，最新指标符合预期，表明第三季经济活动温和扩张。
“私人领域支出仍将支撑经济增长。尽管私人投资料保持温和，但家庭支出将得到持续的就业和薪资增长所支持。最近的政府措施将进一步推动经济活动。”
对外方面，国行表示，尽管出口将继续受到全球需求放缓的影响，但其多元化的结构将部分缓解这一影响。
国行补充：“地缘政治紧张、政策不确定性，以及尚未解决的贸易争端，可能会加剧金融市场的波动，进一步打压全球增长前景。货币宽松和其他政策措施有望为增长提供一些扶持。”
今日会议还批准了2020年MPC会议的时间表，明年将召开6次会议。

Bank of China maintains interest rate at 3%
05 Nov 2019, 08:03 by Ahmad Naqib Idris
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 5): The National Bank maintained its overnight policy rate (OPR) unchanged today, as it expects economic growth this year to be in line with expectations and this pace will continue into 2020.
However, the Bank of China warned that this forecast still faces downside risks, mainly due to the uncertainty of the global economic and financial situation and the weakness of commodity-related sectors.
After the two-day meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep interest rates at 3%.
""At the current level of interest rates, the monetary policy position remains loose and supports economic activity.""
The Bank of China pointed out in the statement that the latest indicators were in line with expectations, indicating a modest expansion of economic activity in the third quarter.
“Private spending will continue to support economic growth. Although private investment is expected to remain moderate, household spending will be supported by continued employment and wage growth. Recent government measures will further boost economic activity.”
Externally, the Bank of China said that although exports will continue to be affected by the slowdown in global demand, its diversified structure will partially alleviate this impact.
Bank Negara added: ""Geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainties, and unresolved trade disputes may exacerbate financial market volatility and further weigh on global growth prospects. Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support for growth.""
The meeting today also approved the timetable for the 2020 MPC meeting, which will be held six times next year.
