《陽光普照》哥哥原型解密　首週末票房創鍾孟宏最佳紀錄
05 Nov 2019, 08:32 by 項貽斐
導演鍾孟宏第5部作品《陽光普照》獲本屆金馬獎11項提名，贏得許多影視名人與觀眾感動推薦，上映首週末票房也開出全台350萬的佳績，成為鍾孟宏拍片以來賣座反應最好的一部。片中飾演哥哥阿豪的許光漢，被視為金馬遺珠，這個讓人心疼的角色，人物原型則來自已故名作家袁哲生。
電影《陽光普照》由鍾孟宏與鏡文學編劇統籌張耀升合作編劇，田調的過程相當仔細，也參考引用文學作品中的意象。其中許光漢飾演的哥哥阿豪對女同學所說的故事，則是取材自已故作家袁哲生的小說《寂寞的遊戲》。
《陽光普照》中許光漢是個溫和順從、努力讀書的孩子，為了上醫學院，進補習班重考，也備受父親陳以文的期待。他雖然一直想當好孩子，關心身邊的人，可是內心其實有不為人知的陰影。當補習班女同學主動接近他，他說了一段自己想像的司馬光砸水缸的故事。

這段司馬光故事改編自袁哲生小說《寂寞的遊戲》，但因為袁哲生於2004年自殺過世，事隔10多年，文壇幾乎無人知道如何與他的家人聯絡。劇組大費周章，最後終於找到他的遺孀，取得授權，並將這段司馬光砸破水缸的故事，以動畫方式呈現。
張耀升透露，片中許光漢角色的原型是參考袁哲生。袁哲生曾屢獲國內各大文學獎，生前是眾人眼中工作認真、生活規律、樂觀友善的人，而在《陽光普照》中許光漢也努力當所有人的陽光，把悲傷放在內心，當他向補習班女同學說出司馬光這個寓言般的故事，只希望有人懂他，但這個女生不懂，全世界都不懂他。
《陽光普照》中的女同學温貞菱與許光漢逛動物園時，兩人走著走著，温貞菱主動牽起他的手、表達心意，不少觀眾在看到這段，都忍不住落淚。
