      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla.-- Lee County Schools wants to improve outreach to potential new hires, throughout the county.</p>
      <p>School board members are expected to approve a grant for the "Grow Your Own Teacher" Program. The $356,832.00 grant would be a slight increase over the program's current cost. The money will go toward scholarships for current and future Florida Gulf Coast University and Florida SouthWestern State College students. The scholarships would be awarded for the 2020-2021 school year. Students who transfer into either school's College of Education will also be able to get scholarship assistance.</p>
      <p>That meeting is November 5th, 2018.</p>
