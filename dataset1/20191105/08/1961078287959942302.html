      <h3>Saw Right Through You</h3>
      <p>After President Trump insisted over the weekend that his border wall was impenetrable, The Washington Post reported that smugglers from Mexico were able to cut through it with a cordless reciprocating saw. On Saturday, Trump changed his story, telling reporters: “We have a very powerful wall. But no matter how powerful, you can cut through anything, in all fairness.”</p>

      <blockquote>“Just after Trump bragged about his super wall, we learned that smugglers have been cutting through the new border wall with basic tools that you can buy at any hardware store. And I wouldn’t be shocked if the guys at Home Depot showed the smugglers how to do it because — because those guys will help you with any project. Yeah, they don’t judge.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“He spent the last four years saying he’s going to build a wall nobody would be able to penetrate. The minute they cut through it he’s like, ‘Well, yeah, if you buy a saw.’”<i> — JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“For four years, this guy told us this wall would be impenetrable. But now he’s like, ‘Of course you can cut through anything.’ In a span of a few hours, the wall went from Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson to literally any other guy named Dwayne.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“<i>[imitating Trump]</i> You’ve got to have a see-through wall because if the wall is not see-through, the only way to know what’s on the other side is by yelling ‘Marco’ and hope they yell ‘Polo.’ That’s the only way. But some Mexicans aren’t named Marco. A lot of people don’t know that, folks.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH<br/></i><br/><br/>“And also, if Trump is saying he built it on purpose to be something that’s easy to open and then close, it isn’t a wall. My man, you’ve built a door.” <i>— TREVOR NOAH</i></blockquote>
      <h3>The Punchiest Punchlines (Tough Crowd Edition)</h3>
      <blockquote>“Trump attended a U.F.C. fight at Madison Square Garden and he was greeted with a mix of cheers and some boos. Yup, half cheered, half booed. Trump was like, ‘Wow, this reminds me of my wedding day.’” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“Yeah, thanks to the end of daylight savings time, Americans picked up one more hour of sleep and one more hour to boo Trump at a sporting event.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“This should be Trump’s crowd! Do you know how hard it is for an old white guy to get booed at a U.F.C. event? It’s the official sport of men who buy their groceries at the gas station.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Donald Trump getting booed at the U.F.C is like Mayor Pete getting booed at Gap Kids — it shouldn’t happen.” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“And then Eric Trump lashed out at the media. He wrote: ‘What a joke. You are the most dishonest people. The audience was chanting “Donald Trump! Donald Trump!” followed by “USA! USA!” Dana White said it was the greatest entrance he has seen into a U.F.C. I can’t wait until we win again in 2020 to further embarrass’ — spelled wrong — ‘your profession. Hashtag fake news.’ Nothing — nothing sums up Eric Trump like misspelling the word ‘embarrassed.’ How does he misspell a word he’s seen on every birthday card since he was 5 years old?” <i>— JIMMY KIMMEL<br/></i><br/><br/>“<i>[imitating Eric Trump]</i> I got your back, dad. ‘Look! Look! Those weren’t boos! Those were cheers. Just listen to this picture I took.” <i>— STEPHEN COLBERT</i></blockquote>
