前行政院長賴清德上月底啟動立委輔選行程，目前已為多位民進黨立委候選人站台，本週六（9日）賴將首度為非民進黨籍的現任立委洪慈庸站台助選，出席洪與總統蔡英文的神岡聯合競選總部成立活動。
洪慈庸昨（4日）在臉書貼出賴清德站台訊息，強調這場競總成立活動除賴清德外，還邀請交通部長林佳龍、立法院副院長蔡其昌等人同場。
洪慈庸8月退出時代力量以後，仍以無黨籍繼續爭取連任，並與同樣無黨的立委林昶佐、立委候選人陳柏惟組成以「抗中保台」為訴求的連線「前線」，力拚勝選。
洪慈庸陣營透露，這次總部成立是日前由洪慈庸親自邀請賴清德，賴不但一口答應出席，還願意幫忙錄製車隊廣播拉票錄音，非常夠意思。
賴清德目前已為民進黨立委候選人黃秀芳、高嘉瑜、吳思瑤、張銘祐、林俊憲、趙天麟、劉世芳、郭國文、李昆澤等人站台輔選，週六賴除了上午為洪慈庸站台，下午也將出席初選時曾挺賴的立委黃國書總部成立活動。
