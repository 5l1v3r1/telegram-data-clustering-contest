      <p>Piers Morgan has been celebrating being cleared by Ofcom after receiving 950 complaints from Good Morning Britain viewers.</p>
      <p>The outspoken GMB host admitted he was "personally quite pleased" with having one of the highest number of complaints to any TV show in the country this year.</p>
      <p>He sparked nearly 1,000 complaints to Ofcom for 'transgender discrimination/offences' by claiming he identified as a 'penguin' and disputing the existence of more than 100 genders.</p>
      <p>Piers wore the accolade like a "badge of honour", but co-host Susanna Reid admitted being complained about made her "cringe".</p>
      <p>A halo then appeared above Susanna's head, which was ironic as she was the only person actually singled out for complaint in Ofcom's ruling.</p>

      <p>Piers said: "Very good ruling I have to say. 1,000 people complained and they all want me fired.</p>
      <p>"The only person singled out for complaint is actually not me...it's Susanna."</p>
      <p>Furious Susanna cried: "He gets exonerated - I get criticised!"</p>
      <p>Piers revealed he was completely cleared for having "very strongly held views" on gender identity and has a right to express those views.</p>

      <p>The Ofcom ruling also stated that the GMB audience has "clear expectations around his provocative position on the issue".</p>
      <p>Seething Susanna replied: "Basically you asked for him, you've got him."</p>
      <p>Ofcom stated that Piers "came close to ridicule with a potential to offend some viewers" by identifying himself as a penguin.</p>
      <p>But they were displeased about the "lack of challenge" from his co-presenter Susanna, which got her in trouble.</p>

      <p>Giggling Piers said: "So the real villain of the piece. I'm in the clear, old halo girl, she gets knifed. Unlucky there Susanna."</p>
      <p>Susanna jokingly blasted Ofcom for "throwing me under the bus" - as Piers joked it wouldn't look good on her CV.</p>
      <p>Giving more of Ofcom's ruling, she added: "We also consider the programme covered a number of discussions on gender issues and Susanna Reid did point out people had the right to choose how they identify which provided further context."</p>

      <p>Good Morning Britain viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to back Piers and the Ofcom decision.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "100% agree with Ofcom and @piersmorgan . Everyone is entitled to their opinions and of you don’t like it or don’t agree with those opinions then so be it. That’s life.</p>
      <p>"This is one of the only people on tv now with good old common sence. top bloke. keep up the good work," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "100% agree! We all have opinions. Get the hell over it! I love Piers"</p>
      <p>"I absolutely agree with decision. Piers is a beacon of common sense in an increasingly crazy world," agreed a fourth.</p>
