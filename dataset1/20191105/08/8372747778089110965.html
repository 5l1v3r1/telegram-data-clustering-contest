      <p>CHARLOTTE, Mich. â€” A Michigan mom is facing criminal charges and possible jail time because of <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/michigan-mom-facing-charges-possible-jail-time-over-late-library-books">late library books.</a></p>
      <p>The books were checked out two years ago from the Charlotte Community Library near Lansing.</p>
      <p>Melinda Sanders Jones said she found out about the warrant for her arrest when her bosses performed a background check for her promotion.</p>
      <p>"I really don't think going to jail over those two books is OK, and I definitely didn't want to steal their property," she said.</p>
      <p>Sanders is charged with failure to return a rental property, which carries a maximum penalty of 93 days in jail and a $500 fine. She's due back in court on Thursday.</p>
