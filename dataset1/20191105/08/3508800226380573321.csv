益生菌不只是「健胃整腸」，還能改善過敏、預防癌症

我們想讓你知道的是許多人對益生菌的觀念還停留在健胃整腸，然而越來越多的研究發現益生菌的好處不只於此。



吃益生菌可以提升免疫力嗎？
許多人對益生菌的觀念還停留在健胃整腸，然而越來越多的研究發現益生菌的好處不只於此。
元老級抗衰老診所醫師柯威旭指出，免疫力講求的是平衡，根據現有益生菌研究，其可幫助增強宿主抗菌及抗病毒能力、促進免疫調節作用、降低身體過敏反應程度等。現代醫學已能根據個人基因與合適益生菌配對，進行「個人化」免疫益生菌，有助改善免疫失衡。
免疫力不是「越高越好」
很多人誤以為，免疫力是越高越好，殊不知其實免疫系統講求的是平衡，許多現代常見疾病，像過敏、自體免疫、病原菌感染和癌症，其實都是免疫失衡造成的。
柯威旭解釋，若免疫反應過於活躍，對外來物質就會造成「過敏」，針對體內抗原則會造成「自體免疫疾病」，像是僵直性脊椎炎、類風溼關節炎。常嚴重過敏者就是免疫反應太高，應緩和免疫反應。
相反地，若免疫反應太低，對於細菌、病毒的抵抗力差，就會造成「感染」，像是常感冒、疱疹反覆發作；另免疫反應低下時，針對體內過度増生的變異細胞，則無法清除，就有可能形成「癌症」，這時就需要提升免疫力。
益生菌不只「有益腸胃」　
已知免疫細胞會分泌細胞激素調控免疫反應，包含干擾素和細胞激素IL-10。研究已證實，干擾素可抑制病毒及腫瘤細胞的複製，調控免疫功能，讓免疫反應提升；細胞激素IL-10則能抑制過度活躍的免疫細胞，讓免疫反應緩和。
柯威旭指出，如何能刺激免疫細胞，依據身體所需分泌干擾素或介白質來調控免疫反應呢？答案就是「益生菌」。
許多人對益生菌的觀念還停留在健胃整腸，然而越來越多的研究發現益生菌的好處不只於此。柯醫師分享益生菌就臨床功能，與免疫相關的主要的正面功效包含：

產生免疫物質，誘發免疫細胞活性，增強宿主抗菌及抗病毒能力。
維持腸道表面保護層的完整，促進免疫調節作用。
改變過敏蛋白的抗原性，降低身體過敏反應的程度等。

益生菌百百種，哪些菌種有助調節免疫？
柯威旭分享，因為每個人的基因、飲食習慣和承受的生活壓力狀態都不同，造就個人獨有的腸道環境，現代醫學技術已可以從個人血液中分離出免疫細胞，再與益生菌進行配對，便能找出適合個人免疫狀況的益生菌，這就是個人化的免疫益生菌。如此一來， 就可依照個人狀況改善免疫失衡，亦能減少許多免疫用藥的副作用。
柯威旭提醒，免疫益生菌仍無法完全取代特定疾病的特定藥物治療，例如免疫抑製劑等。而且服用客製化免疫益生菌時，因腸道狀態可能隨時改變，也須由醫師隨時監控身體免疫反應，適時調整菌種及用量，才能達到免疫平衡促進身體健康。

Probiotics are not just ""stomach and stomach"", but also improve allergies and prevent cancer.
05 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Health Care Network


What we want you to know is that many people's ideas about probiotics remain in the stomach, but more and more studies have found that the benefits of probiotics are not limited to this.



Can probiotics improve immunity?
Many people's ideas about probiotics remain in the stomach, but more and more studies have found that the benefits of probiotics are not limited to this.
Ke Weixu, a veteran anti-aging clinic doctor, points out that immunity is about balance. According to existing probiotic research, it can help strengthen the host's antibacterial and antiviral ability, promote immune regulation, and reduce the degree of allergic reactions in the body. Modern medicine has been able to ""personalize"" immune probiotics based on the matching of individual genes with appropriate probiotics, helping to improve immune imbalances.
Immunity is not ""the higher the better""
Many people mistakenly believe that the higher the immunity, the better. In fact, the immune system is about balance. Many modern common diseases, such as allergies, autoimmune, pathogenic infections and cancer, are actually caused by immune imbalance.
Ke Weixu explained that if the immune response is too active, foreign substances will cause ""allergies"", and anti-antigens will cause ""autoimmune diseases"", such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Often severely allergic is that the immune response is too high and should ease the immune response.
Conversely, if the immune response is too low, the resistance to bacteria and viruses will be poor, and it will cause ""infection"", such as frequent colds and herpes. When the immune response is low, the mutant cells that are overly hyperplastic in the body cannot. If it is cleared, it is possible to form a ""cancer"", and then you need to improve your immunity.
Probiotics are not only ""good for stomach""
It is known that immune cells secrete cytokines to regulate immune responses, including interferon and the cytokine IL-10. Studies have confirmed that interferon can inhibit the replication of viruses and tumor cells, regulate immune function, and enhance immune response; the cytokine IL-10 can inhibit excessively active immune cells and ease the immune response.
Ke Weixu pointed out how to stimulate immune cells and regulate the immune response according to the body's need to secrete interferon or interleukin. The answer is ""probiotics.""
Many people's ideas about probiotics remain in the stomach, but more and more studies have found that the benefits of probiotics are not limited to this. Dr. Ke shares the clinical functions of probiotics, and the main positive effects associated with immunity include:

Produces immune substances, induces immune cell activity, and enhances host antibacterial and antiviral capabilities.
Maintain the integrity of the intestinal surface protective layer and promote immune regulation.
Change the antigenicity of allergenic proteins, reduce the degree of allergic reactions in the body, etc.

There are hundreds of probiotics, which help regulate immunity?
Ke Weixu shared that because each person's genes, eating habits and life pressures are different, creating a unique intestinal environment, modern medical technology can separate immune cells from individual blood and then pair with probiotics. It is possible to find probiotics that are suitable for an individual's immune status. This is a personalized immune probiotic. In this way, immune imbalance can be improved according to personal conditions, and the side effects of many immune drugs can be reduced.
Ke Weixu reminded that immune probiotics still cannot completely replace specific drug treatments for specific diseases, such as immunosuppressive agents. Moreover, when taking the customized immune probiotics, the intestinal status may change at any time, and the doctor must monitor the body's immune response at any time, adjust the strain and dosage in a timely manner, in order to achieve immune balance and promote health.
