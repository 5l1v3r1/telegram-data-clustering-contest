      <h1>IndiGo to announce strategic deal with Qatar Airways, shares up around 2%</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:46:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Aditi Shah | Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's largest airline <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/qatar-airways">Qatar Airways </a>will make a strategic business announcement on Nov 7, the two <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>said in a statement on Tuesday, sending shares of the budget carrier higher by as much as 2%.</p>
      <p>Qatar has in the past shown interest in investing in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>but the Indian airline has resisted.</p>
      <p>"We are very interested in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>... We are talking to IndiGo of doing codeshare, joint flights but not yet an equity stake in the airline," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/qatar-airways">Qatar Airways </a>CEO Akbar Al Baker told <i>Reuters </i>in an interview in August.</p>
      <p>Baker said they had talked to IndiGo but the airline was "not yet ready to take a foreign investor". When it is ready, Qatar will be interested, he had said at the time.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if the announcement is about a codeshare agreement, stake sale or any other kind of partnership.</p>
      <p>Any deal, however, would come at a time when IndiGo's two co-founders, Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, have been embroiled in a dispute about corporate governance of the airline, sparking concerns among investors it could have an impact on the airline's valuation and strategy.</p>
      <p>IndiGo, which has about 40% share of the domestic Indian market, is planning an aggressive push into more international destinations. The airline's CEO Ronojoy Dutta and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/qatar-airways">Qatar Airways </a>CEO Al Baker will "talk about the vision and future for both the airlines", they said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Last week, IndiGo placed a historic order for 300 Airbus A320neo-family planes, including the newest jet, a long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family called the A321XLR.</p>
      <p>IndiGo flies to 60 international destinations including Turkey, China, Vietnam, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia which it has added earlier this year.</p>
