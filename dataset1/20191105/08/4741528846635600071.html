      <h1>Nigeria to leverage on condensate refineries to be petrol net exporter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:04:55+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/chidinma-nwagbara/" target="_blank">Chidinma Nwagbara</a></address>
      <p>In order to achieve the nation’s goal of refining fuel, the <b>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation</b> (NNPC) has disclosed that it’s in the process of establishing two new 200,000 barrels-per-day condensate refineries.</p>
      <p><b>According to</b> <b>a statement</b> by NNPC’s Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, upon completion, the refineries would help transform Nigeria into a net exporter of petroleum products.</p>
      <p><b>While saying the exportation</b> of petroleum products from the condensate refineries would be achieved together with the 445,000bpd capacity of the existing refineries being refurbished, and the 650,000bpd Dangote refinery, <a href="https://punchng.com/nnpc-to-build-two-new-refineries/">Kyari</a> expressed confidence that the NNPC’s effort coupled with that of Dangote Group wpuld guarantee energy security for the country.</p>

      <p><b>The statement read:</b> <i>“Our objective is to make Nigeria a net exporter of petroleum products and you can only achieve that by complementing each other, both the public and the private sector.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We are going to do more and we actually need more of these private sector refineries for Nigeria to become a net exporter of gasoline (petrol) and other associated products.”</i>

      <p><b>What you should know:</b> Condensate refineries are different from conventional refineries. As a result, condensate refineries don’t refine crude oil. They often produce only a product, mostly Premium Motor Spirit, popularly known as petrol.</p>
      <p><b>This announcement on plans</b> to establish two new 200,000 barrels-per-day condensate refineries is coming shortly after news broke out on <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/01/saudi-aramco-nnpc-to-collaborate-to-revamp-dilapidated-nigerian-refineries/">NNPC’s collaboration with Saudi Aramco</a> to renovate refineries in the country.</p>
      <p>The move, which is in line with the goal of the President-Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, was part of the outcome of President Buhari’s visit to Saudi Arabia where he met with Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Chairman of Aramco and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>
      <p>Currently, Nigeria’s dormant refineries include the Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company, Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company, and Port Harcourt Refining Company. Nigeria imports 90% of its gasoline and diesel, as the refineries operate below capacity.</p>
