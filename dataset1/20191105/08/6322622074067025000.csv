新加坡同意再展延RTS 至明年4月30日

（吉隆坡5日讯）应马来西亚的要求，新加坡同意将马新捷运系统（RTS）再延长6个月，至2020年4月30日。
《海峡时报》报道，新加坡交通部长许文远表示，本着双边合作的精神，政府同意第三度展延该项目。
也是基础建设统筹部长的许文远周一以书面回复说，两国将讨论大马对该项目的拟议变更。
不过，他透露，大马还没有分享对该计划的拟议修改。
“没有细节，大马的提案是不完整的，新加坡无法对计划的技术和商业可行性进行全面评估。”
他补充：“虽然我们没有义务接受大马提出的变动，但我们将继续保持开放的态度，认真和客观地评估这些变动。”
“这些变更需涉及修改RTS双边协议，即在延长期间结束前签署该协议，以及另两项协议。”
首相敦马哈迪于上周四（10月31日）宣布，该项目将继续推行，惟成本从49亿3000万令吉，削减36%至31亿6000万令吉。
尽管他没有透露修订后计划的所有细节，但他说项目结构修订的一大特点是，武吉查卡（Bukit Chagar）的地主，即柔州苏丹依布拉欣陛下免除土地成本。
大马与新加坡于5月21日签署补充协议，将该项目推迟至今年9月30日，大马同意向新加坡支付逾60万新元的终止费。
我国交通部长陆兆福早前抨击《The Star》的头条报道，称该项目再推迟6个月是假新闻。

Singapore agrees to extend RTS to April 30 next year
05 Nov 2019, 08:38 by theedgemarkets.com
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 5): At the request of Malaysia, Singapore agreed to extend the Ma Xin MRT System (RTS) for another six months until April 30, 2020.
The Straits Times reported that Singapore’s Minister of Transport, Xu Wenyuan, said that in the spirit of bilateral cooperation, the government agreed to extend the project for the third time.
Xu Wenyuan, who is also the head of the infrastructure coordinator, replied in writing on Monday that the two countries will discuss Malaysia's proposed changes to the project.
However, he revealed that Malaysia has not shared the proposed changes to the plan.
“Without the details, Malaysia’s proposal is incomplete and Singapore cannot fully assess the technical and commercial viability of the plan.”
He added: ""Although we are not obliged to accept the changes proposed by Malaysia, we will continue to maintain an open attitude and evaluate these changes in a serious and objective manner.""
“These changes involve the modification of the RTS bilateral agreement, which means that the agreement is signed before the end of the extension period, and the other two agreements.”
Prime Minister Tun Mahathir announced last Thursday (October 31) that the project will continue to be implemented, but the cost will be reduced by 36% to RM3.16 billion from RM4.93 billion.
Although he did not disclose all the details of the revised plan, he said that one of the major features of the project structure revision was that the landowner of Bukit Chagar, the Sultan of Eurasia, was exempted from land costs.
Malaysia and Singapore signed a supplementary agreement on May 21 to postpone the project until September 30 this year. Malaysia agreed to pay Singapore a termination fee of more than S$600,000.
China’s Minister of Communications, Lu Zhaofu, earlier criticized the headline of The Star, saying that the project was delayed for another six months.
