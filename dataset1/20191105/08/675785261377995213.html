      <h1>Monaco's Ruben Aguilar kicks VAR monitor in fit of rage after being red carded</h1>
      <h2>The French full-back was far from happy after being given his marching orders in the Ligue 1 clash at the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:43:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:43</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-assistant-referee">VAR</a> may have generated some anger among football players since its introduction, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/as-monaco">Monaco</a> defender <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/how-football-manager-mix-up-11319310">Ruben Aguilar</a> let his emotions get the better of him after a decision went against the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Playing for his side in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ligue-1">Ligue 1</a> clash at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/st-etienne">Saint-Etienne</a> at the weekend, the 26-year-old was left fuming after video technology did not overturn the decision to send Aguilar off.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/montpellier-hsc">Montpellier</a> man was no doubt incensed by the dismissal and took his disappointment out on the unfortunate VAR screen that was placed by the side of the pitch.</p>
      <p>As he was seen leaving the field of play to head down the tunnel for an early bath, the right-back kicked the monitor before continuing on his way.</p>

      <p>Aguilar was given his marching orders in stoppage time of a 1-0 defeat away to Saint-Etienne after bringing down Denis Bouanga, scorer of the game's only goal, as he raced towards the penalty box.</p>
      <p>Referee Jerome Brisard showed the 26-year-old a straight red car for the foul, a decision which was backed up by VAR much to Aguilar's anger.</p>
      <p>And it seems the defender was not the only one left furious, with Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim later telling journalists he thought the officials wanted Saint-Etienne to win.</p>

      <p>"It is a balanced match, so, who has given the victory? The referee, of course… It is incredible, despite all the mechanisms in place in France," said the Portuguese boss.</p>
      <p>"Anyone on TV could have seen that. 99 per cent of people think the same thing and nobody among the people whose job this is says anything.</p>

      <p>"Last week, we had a goal against Nantes chalked off, because the referees looked for some offside that happened two minutes before. Today, this happens: 4 minutes of added time with two red cards and six substitutions!"</p>
      <p>Aguilar is not the first footballer to lash out at a VAR monitor, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward Gabriel Jesus attacking one during the Copa America earlier this year.</p>
