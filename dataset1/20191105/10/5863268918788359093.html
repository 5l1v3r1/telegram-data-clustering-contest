      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday said they are close to achieving the objective of the anti-government protest.  He said opposition has agreed that only we will decide when to call off this sit-in.</p>
      <p>Addressing the participants of Azadi March in federal capital, he said we want to see a stronger Pakistan. He said all political parties are on same page and government remains alone today. He said APC of opposition has appreciated Azadin March.</p>
      <p>Fazl said opposition has agreed that only we will decide when to leave this sit-in. He said we are getting closer towards our goals. Fazlur Rehman said all opposition parties today gave the assurance that they will not leave the JUI-F alone in the anti-government movement.</p>
      <p>"We want to pull Pakistan out of isolation," said the JUI-F leader, adding that there is something going on at every front.</p>
      <p>"Imran Khan was first selected, now he is rejected," said Fazl to the crowd.</p>
      <p>On the meeting, Fazl said that the doubt about the opposition being divided has been laid to rest.</p>
      <p>He said rumors against azadi march have lost pace, adding that he is truly grateful to opposition leaders who supported and paid us rich tribute to this March.</p>
      <p>He said Azadi March is voice of entire nation. He said Pakistan s foreign policy is a failure and internally country is unstable, adding that loans taken in one year are more than the those taken in 70 years of history.</p>
      <p>Earlier, an All Parties Conference (APC) of the opposition parties decided to continue sit-in for two more days.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken during an all parties conference summoned by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for planning a joint course of action for the Azadi marchers to proceed for increasing pressure on the government. All opposition parties had been invited to attend the APC.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supported to continue sit-in for two more days.</p>
      <p>The PPP and PML-N are not against staging sit-in at Peshawar Mor but against staging sit-in at D-Chowk.</p>
      <p>Both the opposition parties opposed marching towards D-Chowk and staging sit-in.</p>
      <p>Sources further said that the sit-in would continue until the government’s negotiating team and opposition’s Rehbar Committee reach any conclusion.</p>
