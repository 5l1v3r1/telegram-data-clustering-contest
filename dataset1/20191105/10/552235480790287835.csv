Animal subsequently put down

A woman suffered at least eight deep puncture wounds after a Staffordshire bull terrier sank its teeth into her knee while she was out for an early morning run.
The animal was subsequently put down by its owner, 34-year-old Debbie Bennett, of Myrtle Park, Blairgowrie.
But she was ordered to pay victim Alison Lee £600 in compensation when she appeared for sentence at Perth Sheriff Court.
The accused was also given a community payback order, with 18 months’ supervision, after she admitted the animal was “dangerously out of control” in Rie-Achan Road, Pitlochry, on February 23 this year.
She also pled guilty to failing to comply with a September 4, 2014, dog control notice requiring the dog to be muzzled when it was outside.
