      <p><b>THE HAGUE, NetherlandsÂ (AP)</b> - A Dutch appeals court has convicted a scout leader of branding three children in a campfire initiation ritual.</p>
      <p>The appeals court in the southern city of Den Bosch said Tuesday the man "seriously overstepped the limits" of what is allowed in such an initiation.</p>
      <p>The man, whose identity was not released, was acquitted last year by a lower court that said he was negligent but did not deliberately burn the children at a summer camp in 2017.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old leader was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid labor and ordered to pay one victim just over 700 euros ($780) damages. The other victims did not receive compensation.</p>
      <p>The Dutch scouting organization said last year the man will never work for it again.</p>
