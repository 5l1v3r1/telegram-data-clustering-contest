      <h1>4 Indonesian police officers arrested over Briton’s kidnapping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:49:17+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Four Indonesian police officers have been arrested in connection with the abduction of a British national that saw kidnappers collect a US$900,000 ransom, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Officers staged a fake arrest of the victim at a toll road in Jakarta last week, reinforcing the ruse by briefly taking him to a police compound before moving him to a city hotel.</p>
      <p>There the kidnappers — who included a colleague of the victim — forced him to call his boss to raise the ransom, said Jakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono.</p>
      <p>The Briton was released after it was paid in US dollars, which the gang later changed into local currency.</p>
      <p>Four officers and two civilians have been arrested.</p>
      <p>The British Embassy in Jakarta said it was aware of the incident but would not provide any other information.</p>
      <p>“This is a matter for the Indonesian police,” a spokesman said.</p>
