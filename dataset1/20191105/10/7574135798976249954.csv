Graham Coxon shares new song, covers Billy Idol for ‘End of the F***ing World 2′ (out now on Netflix)
05 Nov 2019, 10:13 by Bill Pearis



It’s been two years since Netflix premiered its UK miniseries adaptation of Charles S. Forsman’s acclaimed 2013 graphic novel The End of the F***ing World. While it wrapped itself up pretty neatly, “limited series” these days means “if this does well there could be more” (see Big Little Lies, 13 Reasons Why) and here we are with The End of the F***ing World 2 which just dropped today on Netflix. In case you forgot, the gist is: “A budding teen psychopath [Alex Lawther] and a rebel hungry for adventure [Jessica Barden] embark on a star-crossed road trip.” The first series was intense, profane, frequently shocking, but also surprisingly sweet and I haven’t seen the second season yet but the trailer, which you can watch below, looks interesting.
Like with the first season, Blur’s Graham Coxon does the music for the show, and the trailer features him performing an eerie, acoustic cover of Billy Idol’s “White Wedding.” Graham’s also shared new song “She Knows,” which is a little Blur-y (think 13 era) and you can listen to that below. The whole soundtrack will be out Friday.
