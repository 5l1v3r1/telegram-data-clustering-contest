This little outdoor library is a nice place to sit and have a relaxing read, while listening to the bubbling sounds coming from the nearby fountain. The Antiquariat is located in the historical part of Hoheneck near Ludwigsburg. Visitors can also purchase any of the used books featured throughout the library’s vast collection. 
The library remains outdoors throughout the entire year and is open 24 hours. There’s also an indoor section filled with vinyl records, and of course more books. However, only the outdoor section remains open throughout the night. 
The idea to construct the library was born out of a desire to save old books from being discarded into trash heaps. It’s a true paradise for book lovers.
