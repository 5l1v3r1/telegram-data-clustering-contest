      <h1>More Than 11,000 Scientists From Around the World Declare a 'Climate Emergency'</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: <i>The world's people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/climate-crisis-11000-scientists-warn-of-untold-suffering">face "untold suffering due to the climate crisis" unless there are major transformations to global society</a>, according to a stark warning from more than 11,000 scientists. "We declare clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency," it states. "To secure a sustainable future, we must change how we live. [This] entails major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems." There is no time to lose, the scientists say: "The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected. It is more severe than anticipated, threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity." <br/><br/>The statement is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806">published in the journal BioScience</a> on the 40th anniversary of the first world climate conference, which was held in Geneva in 1979. The statement was a collaboration of dozens of scientists and endorsed by further 11,000 from 153 nations. The scientists say the urgent changes needed include ending population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating. Prof William Ripple, of Oregon State University and the lead author of the statement, said he was driven to initiate it by the increase in extreme weather he was seeing. A key aim of the warning is to set out a full range of "vital sign" indicators of the causes and effects of climate breakdown, rather than only carbon emissions and surface temperature rise.</i> "A broader set of indicators should be monitored, including human population growth, meat consumption, tree-cover loss, energy consumption, fossil-fuel subsidies and annual economic losses to extreme weather events," said co-author Thomas Newsome, of the University of Sydney. Other "profoundly troubling signs from human activities" selected by the scientists include booming air passenger numbers and world GDP growth. <br/><br/>The scientists did identify some positive signs, including decreasing global birth rates, increasing solar and wind power and fossil fuel divestment, and a falling rate of destruction in the Amazon. They also listed a series of actions people can do to help the "climate crisis": <br/><br/><b>-</b> Use energy far more efficiently and apply strong carbon taxes to cut fossil fuel use<br/><b>-</b> Stabilize global population -- currently growing by 200,000 people a day -- using ethical approaches such as longer education for girls<br/><b>-</b> End the destruction of nature and restore forests and mangroves to absorb CO2<br/><b>-</b> Eat mostly plants and less meat, and reduce food waste<br/><b>-</b> Shift economic goals away from GDP growth</p>
