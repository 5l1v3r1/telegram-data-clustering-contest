      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:50:54+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) announced on Monday that Ellen DeGeneres will  be receiving a lifetime achievement award for television in the form of the second annual Carol Burnett Award at the Golden Globes next year. However, she will be awarded with the trophy at the live awards ceremony on Sunday, January 5, 2020, reported <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/ellen-degeneres-to-receive-tv-lifetime-achievement-award-at-2020-golden-globes/"><i>The Wrap</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“The HFPA is delighted to honour Ellen DeGeneres with the Carol Burnett Award,” said the president Lorenzo Soria. “From her sitcoms, to stand-up, to becoming a household staple on daytime television, she is a pioneer who has captivated audiences for nearly 25 years with her undeniable charm and wit. In addition to her television success, she’s an advocate and philanthropist, lending her voice to those who don’t have one, and spreading kindness and joy through the power of her platform. We look forward to celebrating her achievements at this year’s ceremony.”</p>
      <p>The Carol Burnett Award is to be conferred annually to a person who has made “outstanding contributions to the television medium on or off the screen,” according to the HFPA.</p>
