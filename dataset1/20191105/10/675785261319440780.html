      <h1>Arsenal ‘could accelerate Jose Mourinho interest’ after Leicester clash</h1>
      <h2>Gunners boss Unai Emery is under increasing pressure at the Emirates Stadium after a less than impressive start to the Premier League campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:02:03+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Harris</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> could reportedly accelerate their interest in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> if they lose to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> is under increasing pressure amid fan unrest after a disappointing start to the Premier League season.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard - out of contract at the end of the season - is facing a make-or-break month to save his job after club bigwigs spelt out their expectation of a top-four finish to him.</p>
      <p>But Arsenal could slip nine points behind if they lose to Leicester at the King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Le10Sport</i> , if their trip to the East Midlands ends in disaster, Arsenal could dial up an approach for Mourinho.</p>

      <p>They were recently forced to deny their Head of Football Raul Sanllehi has met with the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss.</p>
      <p>But <i><a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-real-madrid-cet-element-en-faveur-du-dossier-mourinho-a-arsenal-479706">Le10Sport</a> </i>claim Sanllehi is on friendly terms with Jorge Mendes - Mourinho’s agent.</p>
      <p>And the French publication report that relationship would provide ideal conditions for negotiations to take place.</p>
      <p>Mourinho would be a divisive appointment, however.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese’s toxic relationship and previous jibes at the club would likely count against him.</p>
      <p>He had a dig at Gooners after his Manchester United team lost 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: ”I’m happy for them. It's the first time I leave and they're happy. I leave Highbury, they were crying.</p>
      <p>“I leave the Emirates and they were crying, walking the streets with heads low. Today they leave with their scarves.”</p>
      <p>Otherwise, Arsenal are limited in terms of potential options.</p>
      <p>Gunners legend Patrick Vieira, Pep Guardiola’s No.2 Mikel Arteta and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> boss Massimiliano Allegri are three names on the radar.</p>
