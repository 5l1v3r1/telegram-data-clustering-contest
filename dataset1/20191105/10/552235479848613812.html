      <p>Pepe has asked Porto fans to trust them ahead of the trip to face <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The veteran defender has pleaded with supporters to get behind the team and manager during the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> showdown at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/porto">Porto</a> have recently been rocked after a series of poor performances, which included Rangers holding the Portuguese giants to a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>Manager Sergio Conceicao admitted there was an environment of distrust surrounding the club after the fans whistled at them despite beating Aves 1-0 at home.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>And Pepe, 36, has demanded the fans are more patient before they play Rangers in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>He said: "The fans must realise we cannot win every match by three or four goals. It's the same three points no matter the scoreline. Football doesn't work that way.</p>
      <p>"It's not an easy league and every game is difficult. To get the win was very important.</p>
      <p>"I say to the fans that we have to be united - the players and the supporters. We need them to trust us.</p>
      <p>"There is a great team spirit at this club and we now go to Scotland with plenty of confidence determined to get a win this time against Rangers."</p>
