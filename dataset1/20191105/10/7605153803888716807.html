        <b>KATOWICE, Poland, Nov 5 – Olympic chief Thomas Bach on Tuesday urged governments to do more to help “drain the doping swamp” by going after the entourage of a cheating athlete.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The athlete is not the only culprit,” the President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) told the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conference in Katowice.</p>
      <p>“The athlete is supported and sometimes even driven to or forced into doping by a secretive network which may include coaches, agents, dealers, managers, officials from government or sport organisations, doctors, physiotherapists or others,” he said.</p>
      <p>But while sports organisations can punish competitors who test positive they are powerless “to identify and sanction in a deterrent way the athletes’ entourage”.</p>
      <p>As an example he said if the IOC identified a doctor guilty of doping it will banish him from the Games.</p>
      <p>“But after the doctor goes back home, in most cases he can just continue with his nefarious business without any consequences.</p>
      <p>“This is not acceptable. This is the wrong signal. This needs to be changed,” he told WADA delegates on the opening day of their fifth world conference.</p>
      <p>“This is where we need the full support of the government authorities. They have the necessary authority and tools to take action.”</p>
      <p>Bach cited state-doping in Russia, the Aderlass blood-doping Operation and the scandal-hit Nike Oregon Project as all highlighting the “urgent need to focus much more on the athletes’ entourage”.</p>
      <p>By holding everybody implicated in a doping case accountable “we can take a major step forward to strengthen justice and credibility for the protection of the clean athletes and to drain the doping swamp.”</p>
