Bong Go assures public of ‘cholesterol-free’, ‘pork-free’ 2020 national budget

05 Nov 2019, 10:18

SENATOR Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said that he will scrutinize the proposed 2020 national budget to make sure that no taxpayers’ money will be wasted and that it will be a “pork-free or cholesterol-free budget.”
The senator, vice-chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, emphasized that 2020 national budget will undergo scrutiny to make sure that government can maximize it for the betterment of the lives of Filipinos.
“Ako, I’m in favor of pork-free, or cholesterol-free budget. Isa ako sa maghihimay niyan (since) I’m the Vice Chair po of Finance,” Go said.
“Kung kailangan po salain natin ang mga cholesterol, gamitan natin ng tubig para lumutang ‘yung mga cholesterol, gagawin natin. I want it to be pork-free.”
Go also highlighted that the budget should be given back to the people through quality and easily accessible basic services, such as healthcare which could greatly benefit the indigent and those who are hit by calamities and disasters.
“I’m for cholesterol-free budget. Ibalik sa tao ‘yung dapat ibalik (katulad ng) basic services (such as) health – ito ‘yung mga (naapektuhan ng) disaster, nangangailangan po ito. Ibalik natin sa tao ang pera nila,” Go explained to the press.
Asked if he supports the adoption of the House version of the budget and the removal or vetoing of the reported “parked” funds, Go told that he will look into the matter carefully.
“Mag-uusap pa kami. Sa ngayon, basta I’m for pork-free (budget). Ayaw ko ng mga mayroon (hindi pagkakaintindihan),” Go said.
On the possibility of budget reenactment, Go said that the budget for next year must be passed by Congress in time, otherwise the government and the Filipino people will incur losses.
“Alam mo, ang laki  ng nawawala sa Pilipino, ang laki na ng nawawala sa gobyerno tuwing reenacted budget. Kawalan po ng lahat, they are deprived of the basic services po pag re-enacted po,” Go said, adding that he wants to pass the budget on time.  
“Bilisan na natin ito. Trabaho nga naming mga senador ay ipasa ‘yung batas. Bakit hinahayaan natin na hindi maipasa ito on time? Wala nga tayong ginagawa, ang bilis-bilis ng session dito. Kulang (pa ang nagagawa) at naghahanap pa ako ng trabaho dito,” Go urged.

“I, I'm in favor of pork-free, or cholesterol-free budget. I am one of the leaders of that (since) I'm the Vice Chair of Finance, ”Go said.
“If we need to filter cholesterol, we use water to float those cholesterol, we do. I want it to be pork-free. ”
Go also highlighted that the budget should be given back to the people through quality and easily accessible basic services, such as healthcare which could greatly benefit the indigent and those who are hit by calamities and disasters.
“I’m for cholesterol-free budget. Give back to the people who need to restore (such as) basic services (such as) health - those who are (affected by) the disaster, need it. Let's give people their money back, ”Go explained to the press.
Asked if he supports the adoption of the House version of the budget and the removal or vetoing of the reported “parked” funds, Go told that he will look into the matter carefully.

“You know, the size of the Philippines is missing, the size of the government is missing every reenacted budget. Lack of it all, they are deprived of the basic services when they are re-enacted, ”Go said, adding that he wants to pass the budget on time.
“Let's hurry it up. It is our job as senators to pass that law. Why do we let it pass on time? Nothing we do, the fast-paced session here. It's lacking (yet) and I'm still looking for a job here, ”Go urged.
