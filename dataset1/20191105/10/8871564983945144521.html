      <h1>Bike-hailing apps Gojek and Dego to launch Klang Valley pilot program in January 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:24:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>In exciting news for the Malaysian ride-hailing scene, Transport Minister Anthony Loke announced today that motorbike-sharing pilot programs involving <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/go-jek-drivers-protest-outside-malaysian-embassy-demanding-direct-apology-from-taxi-boss-for-poor-indonesians-remark/">Indonesian industry juggernaut Gojek</a> and local start-up Dego will commence for the first time ever in January 2020.</p>
      <p>For six months, both companies will be able to operate under a Proof of Concept (POC) pilot project to test the waters while legislation is passed to regulate bike-hailing business models.</p>
      <p>“Among the conditions of the POC is that it will be confined to the Klang Valley,” Loke told Parliamentarians during Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat today.</p>
      <p>“Other conditions are that the riders must be not less than 18 years old, and they can only ferry one passenger at a time, who are not less than 18 years old.”</p>
      <p>During this time, riders and their bikes must be clearly identifiable, with both riders and passengers insured, and motorbikes used cannot be more than five years old.</p>
      <p>Both the government and the bike-hailing firms will use the POC time period to “gather data, and assess the availability and demand levels” of the service.</p>
      <p>With regards to rider and passenger safety, both the Road Transport Department (JPJ) and police will be working in tandem to enforce traffic laws.</p>
      <p>Last week, the government announced that it would allow bike-hailing services, arguing that they would provide the so-called “last mile” of connectivity in which mass public transportation systems often fall short.</p>
      <p>Or you know, we could have just built a decent transportation system that gets you were you actually need to go. Just a thought!</p>
