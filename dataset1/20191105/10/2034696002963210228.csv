Speaking to CNN Business, Meyers said that it was his idea to introduce a button that allows you to skip mentions of Trump in the show.
The comedian calls it “a funny and innovative way” to “take advantage of the Netflix experience”.



He continued: “It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, ‘Oh, let me guess, there’s going to be jokes about the president’.”
Meyers describes the feature as a “joke”, saying: “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, well, that’s a nice touch, but you’re not going to eat the parsley.”
The late-night TV host has been publicly criticising the President again recently, saying: “Every minute with Donald Trump feels like a horror movie.”
Carly Simon also recently reflected on the time she met Donald Trump, saying he was “all over me like ugly on an ape”.
