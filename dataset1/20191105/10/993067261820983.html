      <p>Green Party Northern Ireland leader Clare Bailey has confirmed she will not run in South Belfast, and instead urged her supporters to vote for the SDLP's Claire Hanna.</p>
      <p>The constituency is expected to see a close race between Ms Hanna and the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly.</p>
      <p>Ms Bailey said she made the decision based on her stance on Brexit, urging voters to return a pro-Remain MP in South Belfast.</p>
      <p>"Almost 70 per cent of the people of South Belfast voted to remain in the EU and it is vital that a pro-Remain MP is returned," she said.</p>
      <p>"This is a first-past-the-post election and Claire Hanna is best placed to take the South Belfast seat from the incumbent pro-Brexit MP, based on previous results."</p>
      <p>Claire Hana said she was "genuinely thrilled to have the backing of the Green Party":</p>

      <p>The Green Party follows Sinn Féin <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/05/news/sinn-fe-in-withdraws-to-give-claire-hanna-best-chance-in-south-belfast-1756551/">who have also stood aside</a> to boost Ms Hanna's chances at the polls in December.</p>
      <p>Ms Little-Pengelly won South Belfast at the 2017 general election, polling 13,299 votes, ahead of nearest rival Alasdair McDonnell of the SDLP on 11,303.</p>
      <p>However, she is likely to come under pressure if many of the 7,000 Sinn Féin votes and 2,000 Green Party votes at the 2017 poll are lent to Ms Hanna.</p>
      <p>The move is the latest in a series of announcements by parties lending support to rivals in the December election.</p>
      <p>The SDLP's Nichola Mallon announced that <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/04/news/sdlp-to-give-sinn-fe-in-s-john-finucane-a-free-run-in-north-belfast-1755288/">she would not contest North Belfast</a>, where Sinn Féin lord mayor John Finucane is hoping to overturn a DUP majority of just over 2,000.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin will also follow the SDLP's example <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/04/news/sinn-fe-in-will-not-contest-election-in-three-seats-1756091/">by not standing in East Belfast and North Down</a> in an effort to help respective pro-Remain candidates Naomi Long of Alliance and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.</p>
      <p>Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster announced that her party will not run in Fermanagh South Tyrone, and will instead back former Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott in a bid to unseat Sinn Fein's Michelle Gildernew.</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott has declined to say whether he intends to run.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, incoming UUP leader Steve Aiken announced that his will not field a candidate in North Belfast, where DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds is expected to come under pressure from Sinn Féin's John Finucane.</p>
