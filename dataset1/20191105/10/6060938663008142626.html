      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abhishek-Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> shuts social media trolls like a pro and Monday saw the actor dole out a savage response to a user who took a dig at him. Abhishek had posted a cheery Monday motivation post on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> which read, “Have a purpose. Have a goal. Something impossible you want to accomplish, then prove to the world that it's not impossible." Replying to his post a social media user commented on Abhishek’s employment status and wrote, “What do you call a person who is happy on a Monday? Unemployed!" to which Abhishek replied, "Nah! Disagree. Somebody who loves doing whatever they are doing."</p>

      <p>Fans of the actor soon started supporting him on social media, lauding his witty response to the troll. In the past too Abhishek has faced flak but the actor always has always come up with a smart retort.</p>
      <p>And to set the record straight, Abhishek Bachchan is not actually unemployed. The actor will soon be seen in Anurag Basu’s yet untitled drama. Also Abhishek has begun shooting for ‘The Big Bull’, which features Ileana D’Cruz as the leading lady. This project will be based on real events which took place in 1990 and 2000. Directed by Kookie Gulati, ‘The Big Bull’ is produced by Ajay Devgn.</p>
