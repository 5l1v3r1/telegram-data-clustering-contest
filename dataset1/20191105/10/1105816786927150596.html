      <h1>Russia jails Jehovah's Witness for six years</h1>

      <p><b>MOSCOW: </b>Russian authorities on Tuesday sentenced a Jehovah’s Witness to six years in prison as Moscow ramps up a crackdown against the US-based religious movement.</p>
      <p>Russia outlawed the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2017, calling them a rebel organisation.</p>
      <p>Sergei Klimov was convicted of being an organiser of an “extremist” group, said Olga Shevtsova, a spokesperson for the Oktyabrsky district court in the western Siberian city of Tomsk.</p>
      <p>“The sentence was handed down today,” she told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>It was the harshest penalty meted out by a Russian court so far against a Russian member of the religious movement.</p>

      <p>In a case that has drawn worldwide condemnation, a Danish Jehovah’s Witness, Dennis Christensen, was sentenced in February to a six-year jail sentence in a Russian prison for “extremism.”</p>
      <p>In September, a court in the western city of Saratov sentenced six Jehovah’s Witnesses to between two and three-and-a-half years in prison.</p>
      <p>Moscow had waged a crackdown against the religious organisation even though Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that its members should not be seen as terrorists.</p>
      <p>Founded in the United States in the late 19th century, the non-violent movement has often faced problems for members’ proselytisation and refusal to salute state symbols such as flags.</p>
