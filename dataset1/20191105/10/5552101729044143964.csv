05 Nov 2019, 10:11 by 吳妍
由東協十國發起，加上中國、日本、南韓、印度、澳洲、紐西蘭等協商的「區域全面經濟夥伴關係協定」（RCEP），為了保護國內服務業勞工與農民，印度總理莫迪近日宣布不會加入，而其他15國則皆已完成協議的文本協商。
印度總理莫迪於曼谷舉行的RCEP峰會上表示，在RCEP談判的7年中，國際形勢有很大的改變，印度則不能忽視這些變化。據《路透》報導，印度憂慮若依協定要求逐步取消關稅，中國及紐澳的農產品大量輸入，將對印度國內經濟造成影響。
針對印度決定不加入RCEP，其他成員國發布聯合聲明表示，印度有重要問題未獲得解決，因此所有成員國將共同努力以彼此滿意的方式解決這些問題。也表示印度最後的決定，將取決於這些問題的解決方案是否能令人滿意。
中國外交部副部長樂玉成則指出「我們持開放態度，若印度準備好了，歡迎加入RCEP」目前RCEP的協議文本、以及相關內容談判以順利結束，後續法律文本審核工作已在進行，2020年可望正式簽署協定。
