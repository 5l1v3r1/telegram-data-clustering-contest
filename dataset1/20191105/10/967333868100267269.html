      <p>Brazilian <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201909141076803939-psg-announces-neymar-will-start-for-first-time-in-four-months/">football star Neymar</a> will escape prosecution for his April clash with a fan, AFP reported Tuesday. French authorities ruled that the football player will only receive a written warning for the incident, and no other measures are required.</p>
      <p>A 29-year-old Rennes man attempted to film the player at Stade de France after PSG lost the finals to Rennes in a penalty shootout.</p>

      <p>According to him, Neymar stopped, lowered the phone and then slapped the fan on the chin.</p>
      <blockquote>"I shouldn't have done it but sometimes it's hard to remain calm", Neymar said on Instagram later.</blockquote>
      <p>The player returned to the pitch this fall after a 4-month pause, after <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201909141076802407-psg-ultras-fume-over-neymars--humiliating-direspect-toward-club-amid-barca-move-talks---report/">an attempt to return to his previous club Barcelona.</a> The transfer, however, failed in September, so the Brazilian star returned to PSG.</p>
      <p>Despite missing several early season matches, Neymar's managed to net four goals in five games since returning, significantly helping his team.</p>
