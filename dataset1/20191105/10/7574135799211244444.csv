05 Nov 2019, 10:52 by Andrew Sacher



Lana Del Rey‘s Norman Fucking Rockwell tour continued at Denver’s Bellco Theatre last night (11/4), and the surprises keep coming. At this show, she brought out Death Cab For Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard to duet with him on a version of Death Cab’s classic “I Will Follow You Into The Dark,” and she also brought out rising singer/songwriter Julia Jacklin, who performed “Don’t Know How To Keep Loving You” off her very solid 2019 album Crushing, with Lana singing harmonies. Both songs sounded great — watch videos and see Lana’s setlist below.
The tour continues in Sioux Falls on Wednesday (11/6) and Lana has more US dates through late November. What other surprises will she have in store?
In other Lana Del Rey news, she’ll be on Kacey Musgraves’ new Christmas special, which comes out on Amazon Prime on November 29.
In other Julia Jacklin news, she’s about to begin her fall tour with Christian Lee Hutson, which hits Brooklyn’s Warsaw on November 8 (tickets). She also co-directed the new Stella Donnelly video for “Seasons Greetings” (with Nick McKk), which came out today and can be watched below.
