      <h2>The woman, 31, opened fire after husband Jeremy King was pistol whipped during the terrifying incident in Florida</h2>

      <p>A pregnant mum shot an armed man dead after he and another broke into her home and grabbed her 11-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>The masked burglars also pistol-whipped her husband during the terrifying break-in, which happened in Florida.</p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gun-crime">pointed a gun </a>at Jeremy King's head and demanded money before his wife opened fire with an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/guns">AR-15 weapon.</a></p>
      <p>Although the woman, who is eight months pregnant, has not been named, her husband has spoken about the incident.</p>
      <p>Mr King told <a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2019/11/01/victim-of-violent-home-invasion-speaks--credits-wife-with-saving-his-life#">Bay News 9</a> : "Them guys came in with two normal pistols and my AR stopped it.</p>

      <p>“[My wife] evened the playing field and kept them from killing me."</p>
      <p>Mr King, 34, was left with a fractured eye socket, a fractured sinus cavity and concussion after what he described as a "severe beating".</p>
      <p>He said he had explained to the men that he had nothing to give them.</p>
      <p>His 31-year-old wife was in a back bedroom when she came out to see what happened, and one of the men opened fire.</p>
      <p>She grabbed her husband's weapon and shot back, fatally injuring the man as he tried to escape.</p>
      <p>He made it 200 yards before collapsing in a ditch, where his body was found.</p>
      <p>His accomplice managed to get away, and police are still looking for him.</p>
      <p>Hillsborough County Sheriff's Maj. Frank Losat told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/home-invader-fatally-shot-florida-pregnant-woman-ar-15-n1076026">NBC News</a> : "Two unknown males broke in and made demands of them.</p>
      <p>"The male victim, who is the homeowner, began to get pistol-whipped and beat up.</p>
      <p>"During that incident, the female homeowner retrieved a firearm, which was in the house legally, and fired one round which struck the male victim that was deceased in the ditch."</p>
      <p>He said he did not think the family was targeted randomly, but Mr King said he has no idea who the men are.</p>
