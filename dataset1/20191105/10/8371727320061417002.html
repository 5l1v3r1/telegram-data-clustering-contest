      <h1>Here is a List of Phones that Uber Kenya and Little Have Banned Their Partners From Using</h1>
      <h2>Includes the iPhone 8. Shocking</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:45:16+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Uber and Little are ride sharing companies and they rely on a number of technologies for the system to work.</p>
      <p>The system relies on having a data plan, GPS and the Uber/Little network that acts as the hub. Drivers need to have phones with great GPS connectivity so that they can be tracked easily by their customers and for accurate positioning.</p>
      <p>This topic has always bugged me for a while since I’ve experienced instances where the driver could not locate me accurately.</p>
      <p>Interesting enough, Uber and Little have a list of banned phones that their driver partners should not use. The list of phones include smartphones you would not expect to find.</p>
      <h3>List of banned/blacklisted devices</h3>
      <h4>Uber</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Infinix Hot 5</li>
        <li>Infinix Note 3</li>
        <li>Infinix Hot 2</li>
        <li>Infinix S2 Pro</li>
        <li>Infinix Smart</li>
        <li>Infinix Hot S</li>
        <li>Infinix Hot Note</li>
        <li>Infinix Note 2</li>
        <li>Infinix Zero 3</li>
        <li>TECNO Camon CX Air</li>
        <li>TECNO Camon CX</li>
        <li>TECNO Pouvoir 2</li>
        <li>TECNO S6</li>
        <li>TECNO B1</li>
        <li>TECNO L8 Lite 2019</li>
        <li>TECNO W1</li>
        <li>Nokia 1</li>
        <li>Nokia 3.1 Plus</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy J1 2016</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy J5</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy Mini Prime 2016</li>
        <li>Huawei P8 Lite</li>
        <li>Huawei Y6 2019</li>
        <li>Wiko Jerry 3</li>
        <li>Safaricom Neo Ray LTE</li>
        <li>Oppo F5</li>
        <li>iPhone 8</li>
        <li>iPhone 7</li>
        <li>iPhone 5s</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a pretty extensive list by Uber and the most surprising entrant in this list has to be the iPhone 8.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT210239"> Apple had acknowledged GPS issues with iPhones and iPhones released in 2012 or earlier</a> but the exclusion of iPhone 8, iPhone 7 and iPhone 5S here is quite interesting.</p>
      <h4>Little</h4>
      <p>Little’s ban list is quite short but they single out specific devices which I will list below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All Infinix devices</li>
        <li>All X-TIGI devices</li>
        <li>TECNO Y5S</li>
        <li>TECNO M3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Little blacklisted the TECNO Y5S, M3 and all X-TIGI devices as of March 2019 while all Infinix devices were blocked as from April 2019.</p>
      <h4>What about Bolt?</h4>
      <p>I decided to check out Bolt (formerly Taxify) and they haven’t blacklisted any phone as specified in their support page. That is a stark contrast to what Little and Uber Kenya have done.</p>
      <h4>So what is the recommended phone to use by driver partners of rideshare companies in Kenya?</h4>
      <p>Little and Uber have the exact requirements for a phone that a driver partner should use. I suspect one copied the other.</p>

        <figcaption>copy paste</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These are the requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Android version: 6.0 or newer</li>
        <li>Single SIM slot only. No dual sim devices</li>
        <li>2GB RAM minimum</li>
        <li>Snapdragon or Mediatek</li>
        <li>Minimum processor model: Snapdragon 630 or the Mediatek Helios P10</li>
        <li>Minimum of an 8 core processor running at 2Ghz</li>
        <li>Minimum Geekbench 4.1 score of 600 (single core) and 4000 (multicore)</li>
        <li>Minimum screen size of 4.7 inches</li>
        <li>Device must have both A-GPS and GLONASS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bolt’s requirements are quite current compared to the ones by Uber and Little.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Devices should run at least Android 9.0 or iOS 13 (Uber and Little don’t mention anything about iOS which is weird)</li>
        <li>Device should have a minimum of 1.5GB of RAM</li>
        <li>They don’t recommend rooted phones.</li>
        <li>Don’t use battery saver since it causes GPS errors</li>
        <li>Connect your phone to a charger during the journey</li>
        <li>Use a phone holder for best possible GPS signal</li>
        <li>Set your location accuracy as “high accuracy”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bolt warns that they will disable a partner’s account if they show “problematic GPS behaviour.”</p>
