（中央社記者楊啟芳台中5日電）世界12強棒球賽B組預賽即將於今天開打，中華隊首戰交手波多黎各，將推出江少慶先發搭配張進德蹲捕，波多黎各將是右投克魯茲先發，但也要提防有大聯盟經驗的左投蘇鐸。
世界12強B組預賽今天開打，中華隊將依序與波多黎各、委內瑞拉及日本隊交手，預賽取前2名晉級複賽，因此每一場都是關鍵。中華隊今天首戰將推出來自印地安人3A的江少慶先發，與捕手張進德搭配。
中華隊總教練洪一中表示，這次中華隊不像以往，沒有特別突出的選手，「不過，整隊投、打還算平均，特色是球隊向心力滿好的，團結大家的力量，一起為這次的比賽打拚，希望打出一場凝聚國人士氣，讓國人感動的比賽。」
波多黎各將推出29歲右投克魯茲（Fernando Cruz）對戰中華隊，他以前曾有美國職棒經驗，最高層級到3A，目前在墨西哥聯盟效力；克魯茲最快球速接近150公里，變化球種有卡特球、指叉球及滑球。
波多黎各總教練岡薩雷茲（Juan Gonzalez）指出，克魯茲的指叉球是武器。
日前在韓國進行的官辦熱身賽，波多黎各曾與C組的韓國隊交手過2場，首場波多黎各先發就是克魯茲，接著左投蘇鐸（Giovanni Soto）接替投球，組成雙先發，因此首戰對中華隊也有可能採用雙先發模式，蘇鐸2015年效力印地安人隊時，曾上過大聯盟。
比起同組的委內瑞拉是純美式風格，波多黎各球風較多元，教練會下達積極戰術，包括盜壘、打帶跑等，因此中華隊守備也要注意。
波多黎各打線中，要特別小心歐提茲（Daniel Ortiz），歐提茲於2017年效力海盜隊時曾上過大聯盟，本季在墨西哥聯盟出賽117場，敲出42發全壘打，打擊率3成12；另外，賈西亞（Anthony Garcia）也具有長打能力，目前在美職巨人隊3A，去年單季敲出25轟。
波多黎各陣中有多名效力過中職的投手，分別為前兄弟象投手羅曼（Orlando Roman）、曾效力Lamigo桃猿的前救援王米吉亞（Miguel Mejia）、及前桃猿洋投拿威（Efrain Nieves），預計米吉亞仍會是終結者角色。（編輯：戴光育）1081105
