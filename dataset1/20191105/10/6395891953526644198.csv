CLEVELAND (AP) - Authorities say a man suspected in a shooting that left three people dead in Cleveland has pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder.
Twenty-five-year-old Kielonte Harris pleaded not guilty Monday to one count. His bond was set at $1.5 million. Court records don't show an attorney who could speak for him.
Authorities say they found 36-year-old April Magana's body inside a home and 31-year-old Joseph Meeks III dead in an alley Saturday.
An injured Muriel Tursivio was found in a nearby vacant lot and died at a hospital.
Police say all three had been attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.
A prosecutor said at Monday's hearing that he expects additional charges to be filed against Harris.
