      <p>The United States announced its readiness to provide full support to political dialogue in Libya.<br/><br/>The US Embassy in Libya issued a statement announcing that “at Libya’s request, the US Embassy is prepared to offer its full support to such a Libyan political dialogue.”<br/><br/>US Ambassador to Tripoli Richard Norland emphasized that the ongoing conflict is undermining the shared US-Libya fight against terrorism and hurting prospects for renewed economic growth in Libya.<br/><br/>It said that Norland held a “useful” meeting with head of the Government of National Accord, Fayez al-Sarraj, in London on November 3 to discuss efforts to end the conflict in the capital.<br/><br/>Norland reiterated US support for Libya’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, amid the escalating involvement of “external state actors and mercenaries” in the conflict and increased numbers of civilian casualties.<br/><br/>“The United States opposes such escalation and is committed to working with Libyan and international partners, under the guidance of UN SRSG Ghassan Salame, to break the destructive cycle of foreign-enabled offensive and counter-offensive that has already claimed far too many innocent Libyan lives.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, led by Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan National Army (LNA) published through its military information division what it said were scenes documenting the army's artillery targeting sites of militias in areas south of the capital.<br/><br/>It announced that it targeted a terrorist bunker at Mitiga airbase in Tripoli and another at Misrata Air College.<br/><br/>LNA spokesman, Ahmed al-Mismari, stated that a double airstrike was carried out on the military section of Mitiga air base and Misrata Air College, noting that the warplanes were launched from several air bases and attacked the targets at the same time to “eliminate this threat”.<br/><br/>The air campaign had “achieved its objectives accurately,” and fully destroyed the facilities used to store and equip aircraft in Mitiga and Misrata, said the statement.<br/><br/>Full air sovereignty of the LNA’s Air Force over Libyan airspace was fully restored, Mismari stressed.<br/><br/>In April, the LNA launched a military operation to liberate Tripoli from terrorist and criminal gangs. Its forces have also targeted Mitiga and Misrata air bases because they are being used to attack their advancing troops.</p>
