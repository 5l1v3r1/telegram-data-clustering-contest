      <p>The British pound edged higher on Tuesday, tracking some lingering overnight weakness in the greenback though election-related uncertainty capped gains.</p>
      <p>Weak PMI data on Monday also muted any expectations of policy changes from the Bank of England at a policy meeting this week.</p>
      <p>The PMI data showed that construction shrank for the sixth month in a row in October - in line with expectations and reflecting a slowdown in growth due to political uncertainty before <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a>'s now-defunct October 31 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> deadline.</p>
      <p>BNP Paribas economists, for one, expect the central bank's November policy meeting to be a neutral event for the pound.</p>
      <p>"We maintain a structurally bullish stance on the currency, although with uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the general election, we are patient," they said in a note.</p>
      <p>Against the dollar, the pound drifted 0.2 percent higher at $1.29 but remained well within recent trading ranges.</p>
      <p>Versus the euro, the pound was steady at 86.31 pence ($1.11).</p>
      <p>Leveraged funds that bet on the direction of sterling reduced their short positions on the pound in the week to October 29 to $2.6bn, a six-month low, according to CFTC data on Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>With just over five weeks until Britain heads to the polls on December 12, the ruling Conservative party is leading in the polls and the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit is considered to have been reduced.</p>
