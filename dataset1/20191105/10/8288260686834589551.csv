Aston Villa boss Dean Smith says Jack Grealish is fit and ready to join up with the England squad if he is called up by Gareth Southgate.
The Three Lions host Montenegro in a Euro 2020 qualifier on November 14 before travelling to Kosovo three days later.
Grealish has been touted for the next England squad following his excellent displays for Villa in recent weeks, the captain netting his first goals of the season for the club last month.
He was instrumental in the 2-1 defeat of Brighton and Hove Albion on October 19, scoring the equaliser before setting up Matt Targett's last-gasp winner.
