      <h1>If you experience these signs then know your salary is not enough</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:40:23+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/news-team/" target="_blank">Chacha Wabara</a></address>
      <p>Some times, having a job simply isn’t enough. Because a lot of people strive really hard while hunting for jobs, they immediately settle for whatever placement that opens and salary compensation they’re paid. Of course, you cannot because of earning less (under-employment) quit your current job; you just need to consider adding “something extra” as monthly support stream of income.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, a long list of rich folks did not rely on salaries alone. They probably had tons of investment or “side hustle” you didn’t know about. If you experience these signs then know your salary is not enough;</p>
      <h3>Indebtedness</h3>
      <p>This does not apply for chronic debtors (people who can’t be bothered to pay off their debts). If you find out that your debts keep piling up, you may not be making as much as you thought you were. You have bills piling up here and there to the point that you start choosing which bills to pay with the current paycheck and which to put off for next month’s pay.</p>
