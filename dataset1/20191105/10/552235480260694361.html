      <h1>Scotland's first Santa only Post Office will transform empty space into Victorian festive wonderland</h1>
      <h2>Open next month, the post office will be spreading Christmas cheer to all.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:59:36+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland will this year have a Santa only <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/post-office">Post Office</a> for children, and adults, to post their letters to Father Christmas.</p>
      <p>The first of its kind in Scotland will see designers transform an empty space in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/crieff">Crieff</a> , Perth and Kinross, into a Victorian themed post office.</p>
      <p>Children will be able to post their letters directly to Santa with the help of some friendly elves who will be spreading <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> cheer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The post office, in James Square in the town, will include writing paper, stickers and a magic post box which shows the letters on their way to Lapland.</p>
      <p>The currently empty retail space will be decked out like a festive wonderland run by Santa's elves. There will also be a separate area as an 'elf workshop' which will include a wrapping station and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> themed games.</p>
      <p>Open from Saturday, November 30 to coincide with the town's light switch on, kids will also have a chance to meet Santa himself when he visits on December 7.</p>
      <p>David McCann, from Crieff Succeeds, told the <i><b>Daily Record</b> </i>: "Santa’s post offices have proved extremely popular in England and Wales, so we’re delighted to have the first ever one in Scotland here in Crieff.</p>
      <p>"Entry will be free although we will include a donation box to raise money for a local <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charity">charity</a> .</p>
      <p>"The post office will be open on Saturdays and Sundays and possibly for a few hours every day during the week late afternoon. There will also be an external post box so that letters can be posted at any time of day. "</p>
