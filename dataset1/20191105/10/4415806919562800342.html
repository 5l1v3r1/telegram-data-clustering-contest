      <p>Tess Daly has said working with Terry Wogan on Children In Need was an “utter privilege”.</p>
      <p>Wogan hosted the annual telethon for 35 years, latterly alongside the Strictly Come Dancing presenter.</p>
      <p>Daly said working with the veteran broadcaster was the highlight of her time on the charity broadcast.</p>

      <p>Children In Need returns to the BBC this month, with Daly at the helm for a night of fundraising and special shows.</p>
      <p>The presenter revealed that she has to watch appeal videos in advance to avoid being shocked and left in tears live on TV.</p>
      <p>She said of her work on the annual broadcast: “The highlight of my Children In Need years will always be getting to stand by the great man, Sir Terry Wogan’s side.</p>
      <p>“What a pleasure and utter privilege that was.”</p>
      <p>Wogan died in 2016 after enjoying decades as the face of Children In Need, and other BBC work on Radio 2 and presenting the UK’s Eurovision Song Contest coverage.</p>
      <p>Daly has her own packed schedule in the countdown to Christmas, with Strictly in full swing.</p>

      <p>She said: “It’s the start of a busy weekend for me, and I literally walk off the studio floor and into the car to head up to Blackpool for our Strictly special!</p>
      <p>“I also pre-watch all the appeal films as many of them are incredibly emotive and if I watched them for the first time live on the night I’d be in floods of tears and unable to speak.”</p>
      <p>Daly said it would be difficult for Children In Need to continue breaking records, but has praised the generosity of the British public.</p>
      <p>Fellow presenter Ade Adepitan has also praised the late Wogan, who was a fixture of his childhood.</p>
      <p>He said: “My first time presenting Children In Need will always be a super special one for me.</p>
      <p>“I think it might have been the first year without Sir Terry Wogan and to be asked to do it was mind-blowing.</p>
      <p>“I grew up watching Children In Need and then to be part of the whole thing on appeal night – that just sent shivers down my spine.”</p>
      <p>The annual charity broadcast returns with presenters Adepitan, Graham Norton, Mel Giedroyc and Marvin and Rochelle Humes on Friday November 15 on BBC One.</p>
      <p>There will be special sketches, musical acts and guest appearances during the evening’s entertainment, including a Strictly dance, Norton’s Red Chair, and a Mock The Week show.</p>
