      <p>A dentist could be stripped of his licence after he was caught aggressively shaking a child before threatening to 'beat him' in the clinic.</p>
      <p>Dentist Tolegen Mukhambetov was seen man-handling the seven-year-old boy 'like a dog' when he tried to remove his tooth.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage in his Kazakhstan clinic shows Mukhambetov grabbing the boy from the dentist chair and throwing him back to be held by nurses.</p>
      <p>The boy was terrified and struggled to sit still on the reclined dentist chair.</p>
      <p>He then threatened to strike the child with an implement he brandished in a threatening manner in his left hand.</p>
      <p>Two nurses did not seem to be concerned about the dentist's action.</p>

      <p>Mum Kyzgaldak Saparova said she warned the dentist that her son was frightened of having his tooth out, reported <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/events/skandal-v-stomatologii-aktau-mat-rebenka-mogut-nakazat-383224/">Tengri News</a> .</p>
      <p>She said: "I was trying to persuade him to open his mouth for two hours.</p>
      <p>"Three times we went into the room but he was so afraid and did not open the mouth.</p>
      <p>"The last time the dentist aggressively told me to bring my son in - and immediately leave.</p>
      <p>"I sat in the corridor and heard my son calling me – ‘Mama, mama’."</p>
      <p>She was told by her son that the dentist beat him.</p>

      <p>Upon reviewing the surveillance footage, Kyzgaldak reported the incident to the police as she described the dentist grabbed her son 'like a dog'.</p>
      <p>She said: "I saw the dentist was aggressive with my son, he grabbed him, and threatened him with his tools.</p>
      <p>“He grabbed him like a dog.</p>
      <p>"I went to the police. I won’t let him get away with it.”</p>
      <p>Police confirmed they are investigating the incident on Friday and have examined the boy for injuries.</p>
      <p>Kaldymurat Aigarakov, deputy head of the Aktau Police Department said a forensic medical examination has been ordered for the presence of beatings to the child.</p>
      <p>The dentist later posted a message confessing that he 'strongly shook and pulled the boy'.</p>
      <p>The message read: "I did not beat him, but I did pull him strongly.</p>
      <p>"I scared him a bit to make him sit. It was only for the sake of removing his tooth."</p>

      <p>The dentist is being investigated under a law that could see him jailed for ten days or fined.</p>
      <p>He also faces a probe by the regional health department which could strip him of his job.</p>
      <p>Kuat Mashyrykov, director of the Mangystau Regional Dental Centre, said: "He confessed to his deed, immediately said that he was quitting on his own.</p>
      <p>"According to him, he had good intentions.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to help a sick child, but it turned out how it happened.</p>
      <p>"During his work since 2017, he never got into such situations, complaints have never been received."</p>
