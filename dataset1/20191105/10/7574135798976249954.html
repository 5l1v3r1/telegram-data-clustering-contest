      <p>It’s been two years since Netflix premiered its UK miniseries adaptation of Charles S. Forsman’s acclaimed 2013 graphic novel <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/graham-coxon-scored-netflixs-twisted-teen-series-the-end-of-the-fing-world-2/"><i>The End of the F***ing World</i></a>. While it wrapped itself up pretty neatly, “limited series” these days means “if this does well there could be more” (see <i>Big Little Lies, 13 Reasons Why</i>) and here we are with <i>The End of the F***ing World 2</i> which just dropped today on Netflix. In case you forgot, the gist is: “A budding teen psychopath [Alex Lawther] and a rebel hungry for adventure [Jessica Barden] embark on a star-crossed road trip.” The first series was intense, profane, frequently shocking, but also surprisingly sweet and I haven’t seen the second season yet but the trailer, which you can watch below, looks interesting.</p>
      <p>Like with the first season, Blur’s <b>Graham Coxon</b> does the music for the show, and the trailer features him performing an eerie, acoustic cover of Billy Idol’s “White Wedding.” Graham’s also shared new song “She Knows,” which is a little Blur-y (think <i>13</i> era) and you can listen to that below. The whole soundtrack will be out Friday.</p>
