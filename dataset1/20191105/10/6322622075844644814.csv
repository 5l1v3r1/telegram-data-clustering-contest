国行按兵不动 马股随令吉走高
05 Nov 2019, 10:55 by Wong Ee Lin
（吉隆坡5日讯）国家银行维持隔夜政策利率（OPR）于3%后，令吉汇率走强，带动马股全日上升3.18点或0.2%。
此外，中美贸易协议有望达成，激励隔夜美股创纪录收盘高位，马股也可能追随亚洲股市的涨势。
富时隆综指尾盘反弹，以全日最高的1606.74点挂收，盘中曾跌至1597.76点。
外汇市场方面，令吉兑美元升至4.1315，这显然是对国行今午3时的利率决定作出回应。
由于资本外流的担忧，降息理论上不利于汇率。
乐天交易研究副总裁刘松增向theedgemarkets.com说：“在国行决定将利率维持于3%后，综指在尾盘受到乐观情绪的提振。”
国行今日在文告中指出，我国2019年经济增长料符合预期，且经济增速将持续到2020年。
“这一预测仍面临下行风险，主要由于全球经济和金融状况的不确定性，以及大宗商品相关领域疲弱。”
马股全日共有26亿2000万股，值22亿5000万令吉成交。主要上升股包括吉隆坡甲洞（Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd）和美佳第一（Mega First Corp Bhd）。
路透社报道，亚洲股市周二升至6个月高点，超过7月高位，因预期美国政府可能会取消对中国输美产品征收的部分关税，这提振人们对全球经济前景的乐观情绪。
MSCI明晟亚太地区（除日本）指数升0.5%，至5月初的水平，中国股市领涨。
报道指出：“多位知悉中美贸易谈判人士周一表示，中国方面正在要求美国总统Donald Trump取消更多9月实施的关税措施，作为中美第一阶段贸易协议的一部份内容。”

The national bank is not moving, the horse stocks are rising with the ringgit.

KUALA LUMPUR (April 5): The National Bank maintained its overnight policy rate (OPR) at 3%, and the ringgit exchange rate strengthened, driving the Malaysian stock market to rise 3.18 points or 0.2%.
In addition, the Sino-US trade agreement is expected to be reached, stimulating overnight US stocks to record highs, and the FBM KL may also follow the gains in Asian stock markets.
The FTSE KLCI rebounded in late trading and closed at the highest of 1606.74 points in the day. It fell to 1597.76 points in intraday trading.
In the foreign exchange market, the ringgit rose to 4.1315 against the US dollar, which is obviously a response to the decision of the Bank of China at 3 am.
Due to concerns about capital outflows, interest rate cuts are theoretically not conducive to exchange rates.
Liu Songzeng, vice president of Rakuten Trading Research, said to theedgemarkets.com: ""After the decision of the Bank of China to maintain interest rates at 3%, the KLCI was boosted by optimism in the late session.""
The Bank of China pointed out in its statement today that China’s economic growth in 2019 is expected to meet expectations, and the economic growth rate will continue until 2020.
“This forecast is still facing downside risks, mainly due to the uncertainty of the global economic and financial situation and the weakness of commodity-related sectors.”
The Malaysian stock market had a total of 2.62 billion shares and a turnover of RM2.25 billion. Major upholds include Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and Mega First Corp Bhd.
Reuters reported that Asian stocks rose to a six-month high on Tuesday, surpassing the July high, as the US government is expected to cancel some of the tariffs imposed on Chinese exports to the US, boosting optimism about the global economic outlook.
MSCI's Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) index rose 0.5% to the level of early May, and China's stock market led the gains.
The report pointed out: ""Many people know that Sino-US trade negotiators said on Monday that the Chinese side is asking US President Donald Trump to cancel more tariff measures implemented in September as part of the first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States.""
