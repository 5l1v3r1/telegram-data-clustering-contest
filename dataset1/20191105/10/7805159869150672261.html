      <h1>Upcoming Chromebook will feature Ambient EQ like the Pixel 4 and Nest Hub</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:22:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-specs-features-pricing-availability/">The Pixel 4 launched</a> with a new 90Hz “Smooth Display” and a feature called Ambient EQ. This is Google’s name for automatic white balance adjustment and it was previously introduced on the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-home-hub-smart-display-google-chromecast-v3/">Google Nest Hub</a> and<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-nest-hub-max-officially-announced/"> Nest Hub Max</a>. Now, multiple commits in Chromium Gerrit mention adding a flag to enable Ambient EQ on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/chrome-os/">Chrome OS</a>.</p>
      <p>Ambient EQ is a feature that aims to make displays more comfortable to read in different lighting conditions. It works by using an ambient light color sensor to adjust the color temperature of the display. It’s essentially a more advanced version of auto-brightness and it can further reduce strain on your eyes. Currently, there are no Chromebooks on the market with an ambient light color sensor, so these commits indicated such a device could be coming soon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1894163/1">first commit</a> is for adding a flag to hide or show the Ambient EQ UI. The <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1835170">second commit</a> is for testing ambient color device support. Lastly, the <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1790126/5">third commit</a> is for adding UI control for Ambient EQ. We’re not sure when this <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/chromebook/">Chromebook</a> with an ambient light color sensor will be coming, but we’ll keep an eye out. This is a feature that makes a lot of sense for a laptop device. We’ve all used a laptop late at night in a dark room, and Ambient EQ would help a lot.</p>
