      <p>(Reuters) - Plenty of superstitions surround black cats, and the appearance of a feline of that color certainly did not hurt the Dallas Cowboys as they beat the New York Giants in an NFL game on Monday.</p>

      <p>The cat entered the field during the second quarter, holding the game up for two minutes before it disappeared under a section of spectator seating and the action resumed.</p>
      <p>Dallas were down 9-3 at the time, but thereafter out-scored the Giants by 25 points in a 37-18 victory at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>The cat was a major talking point after the game.</p>
      <p>“Things did kind of change when that black cat came out,” joked Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.</p>
      <p>Dallas receiver Amari Cooper welcomed the cat’s appearance, though not for superstitious reasons.</p>
      <p>“I was kind of happy about that because it came around the time that my knee was hurting so I was thinking I had a little bit more time to get this thing right,” he said.</p>
      <p>Others were less pleased with the feline’s presence.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Dak Prescott said: “I’m not superstitious, but I wasn’t getting near it.”</p>
      <p>Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott was of a similar mindset.</p>
      <p>“I’m allergic to cats,” he said.</p>
      <p>The result means Dallas improved to five wins for three losses, top of the NFC East standings, while division rivals Giants slipped to 2-7.</p>
      <p>The stadium’s official Twitter account said after the game that the cat was still on the loose, and promised to take it to a vet for a check up if it was located.</p>
