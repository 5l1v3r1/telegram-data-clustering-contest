【插畫】你的社交帳號充滿炫耀，你一定是假帳號
05 Nov 2019, 10:31 by 湯米


我們想讓你知道的是人真正的生活，應該是開心和不如意的集合，但在社群媒體上，有很多人，好像就只呈現幸福的一面。

社群網站上，時不時會發生帳號被檢舉的事件，有些有理，有些還真不知道為什麼，話說回來，各大網站的「假帳號」檢核標準，好像誰也摸不著頭緒。
話說回來，就算人真的存在，用自己的名字，傳自己的照片，螢幕裡的那個人，就真的是自己嗎？美食、出遊、各種歡樂的派對和美照，真的就是人生的全部嗎？完美的身型、棚拍一般的光影，這真是我們呈現給真實世界的面貌嗎？人真正的生活，應該是開心和不如意的集合，但在社群媒體上，有很多人，好像就只呈現幸福的一面。
從這個角度來看，大部分的人的帳號，好像其實都是假帳號。

[Illustration] Your social account is full of show off, you must be a fake account

What we want you to know is the real life of people. It should be a collection of happy and unsatisfactory. But in the social media, there are many people who seem to have only a happy side.

On the social networking site, there are occasions when the account is being reported. Some of them are reasonable. Some of them really don’t know why. In other words, the ""fake account"" check standards of major websites seem to be incomprehensible.
Having said that, even if people really exist, use their own name, pass their photos, the person in the screen, is it really himself? Food, travel, all kinds of happy parties and beautiful photos, is it really all about life? The perfect body shape, the general light and shadow of the studio, is this really the face we present to the real world? People's real life should be a collection of happy and unsatisfactory, but in the social media, there are many people, it seems that only a happy side.
From this point of view, most of the people's accounts seem to be fake accounts.
