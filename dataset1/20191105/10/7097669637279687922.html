      <h1>Drug suspects shoot way out of Thai court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:28:44+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Three drug suspects -- including an American -- shot and stabbed their way out of a Thai court before brazenly fleeing in a pick-up truck, police said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The three were still on the loose more than 24 hours after breaking out of a Pattaya court holding room on Monday, police told AFP.</p>
      <p>Officers were combing the seedy beach resort city, located two hours southeast of Bangkok.</p>
      <p>"If they resist... officials have to carry out decisive measures," said Krissana Pattanacharoen, national police office spokesman.</p>
      <p>The escapees are an American and his Thai wife, and a male Thai suspect.</p>
      <p>The couple was facing death penalty charges for drug trafficking, although sentences are rarely carried out.</p>
      <p>Krissana said their relatives had been contacted to try and urge them to surrender and avoid a violent showdown.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the Thai man had somehow got hold of a gun and knife that he used to attack a police officer allowing the trio to escape.</p>
      <p>The officer was recovering, Krissana said.</p>
      <p>Thailand is both a producer and major transit hub for drugs.</p>
      <p>Much of regional drug manufacturing takes place in the Golden Triangle, a remote border region where Myanmar, Laos and Thailand all meet.</p>
      <p>But busts at the country's busy airports frequently grab headlines.</p>
      <p>Thai authorities said Tuesday that a Kenyan woman was arrested on Saturday for swallowing bags of cocaine weighing 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds).</p>
