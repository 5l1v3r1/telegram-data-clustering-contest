      <p>Fingernails are in short supply at Billesley Common these days, but despite experiencing four consecutive watch-from-behind-the-sofa finales, with a third of the season complete Adam Balding’s team remain unbeaten on home turf.</p>
      <p>Sale were the latest side to leave Birmingham with only a consolatory losing bonus point, as the Red-and-Blacks once again held their collective nerve to score the ten points which clinched the National One spoils.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But while the club’s loyal fans currently face a fortnightly emotional roller-coaster ride, according to experienced back-rower Jacques le Roux there are nothing but cool heads to be found on the other side of the touchline.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit touch-and-go at the end,” he admitted, “but in National One it is not unusual for it to take 60 or 70 minutes to break a team down, as there isn’t very much between a lot of them. “The results so far have shown that any team can beat another on their day, so it wasn’t a surprise when it went to the wire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Our good discipline and composure then played a massive role – those are areas where we have worked hard, and I think the benefits of that are showing. “Last year we lost a number of games in the closing stages but now we’ve learned which is a massive tribute to the boys’ ability to keep a cool head and get the job done.”</p>
      <p>The former Coventry favourite, who is now in his <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/moseley-rfc">fourth season at Moseley</a> said gaining four points against Sale was the primary objective for a group of players who have the bigger picture in mind.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>"Bonus points play a massive role"</h3>
      <p>“We knew Saturday would be a tough game and the conditions were difficult as well,” he said. “It was a difficult start for us, getting two yellow cards only two minutes in, but the boys kept their composure. As a result, we didn’t concede too many points during the next ten minutes which really helped us.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“When we turned to play downhill the wind was behind us and we knew if we stuck to our game-plan the result would come. “A win is a win, and we’ve seen over the last few seasons that has to be your first priority. Bonus points play a massive role, but they are a secondary thing.</p>
      <p>“Last week we said that the next three games would be vital to our season, and set ourselves the target of winning them all to ensure we stay in a competitive position towards the top of the table.</p>
      <p>“We are one out of one after Saturday, which was always going to be a tough game, but with the advantage of a home crowd behind us we always believed that it was a game that we could win.</p>
      <p>“Travelling to Plymouth next weekend will be difficult, but we are going on Friday which will hopefully help us be fresh to deliver on Saturday. They are a very tough team to break down at home – some of this year’s results have not gone their way but we’re not reading too much into that and we’re expecting a hard game.”</p>
