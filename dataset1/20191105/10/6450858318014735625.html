      <h1>Amazon’s Black Friday sales will last a whole week</h1>
      <h2>Not content with a single day, you’ll be able to save on big tech and more for eight days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has announced that its Black Friday event in the UK will last for an eight-day stretch from Friday 22 November until Black Friday itself on Friday 29 November. Along with every other online retailer under the sun, the company will take full advantage of the fever pitch created around the Black Friday phenomenon with massive discounts the Friday after Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>We don’t know what big-ticket tech item prices will be slashed yet, but with eight days to fill you can be sure there will be <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/best-deals/">great tech deals</a> for everyone.</p>
      <p>Not only that, there will be additional Amazon ‘countdown’ sales starting on Monday 18 November through to Thursday 21 November to pep everyone up.</p>
      <p>While this is aimed to stoke excitement, it’s also a nightmare for you as consumers – do you pull the trigger on the first day? Will the prices go down further? Will stock run out?</p>

      <p>Amazon hasn’t announced any official <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday</a> plans, but you can be pretty certain the deals will continue as they always do for Monday 2 December.
