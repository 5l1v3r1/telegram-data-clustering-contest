      <p>Batteries are used in an increasing range of applications, from portable electronics to electric vehicles. This increasing range of applications requires high performance battery materials that provide long lasting, light weight, fast charging and stable power sources. Particle size is a critical factor in battery performance.<br/><br/>Creating a battery material with optimum power production and energy storage will require control of the particle size distribution of the electrode materials.<br/><br/>Laser diffraction is a widely used technique for measuring particles size distributions for materials across a wide range of industries. In this webinar we will introduce the technique of laser diffraction and show how the Mastersizer 3000 can be used to characterize battery materials.<br/><br/>More information<br/>Who should attend?<br/>- Anyone developing battery materials or interested in characterizing battery materials should attend.<br/><br/>What will you learn?</p>
      <p>- Attendees will learn why particle size is important for battery materials, how the Mastersizer measures particle sizes and the result that you can get from the Mastersizer for battery materials.</p>
