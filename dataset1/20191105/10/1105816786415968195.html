      <p>Actor Keanu Reeves seems to officially be dating his business partner, Alexandra Grant, and fans are thrilled about the news.</p>
      <p>The new couple attended the LACMA Art + Film Gala presented by Gucci in Los Angeles together on the weekend and were photographed holding hands on the red carpet. The 55-year old star and 46-year old Grant co-founded the publishing house X Artists’ Books, reported <i><a href="https://popculture.com/celebrity-couples/2019/11/05/keanu-reeves-new-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-fan-reactions/">Pop Culture</a></i>.</p>

      <p>Fans took to social media to react to the budding relationship. “I pray she treats you good. I am so happy for you Keanu Reeves because you deserve to be happy with someone,” one person wrote.</p>

      <p>Reeves’ last serious public relationship was with Jennifer Syme in the late ‘90s. She gave birth to their daughter in 1999, but it was stillborn. She tragically died in a car accident in 2001, a couple years after the couple had split.</p>
      <p>For Reeves professionally, he’s perhaps never been more in demand. This year alone, he’s starred in<i> John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum</i>, <i>Toy Story 4</i> and Netflix’s <i>Always Be My Maybe</i>. It was also announced earlier this year that he will be in a forthcoming <i>Matrix 4</i> film.</p>
