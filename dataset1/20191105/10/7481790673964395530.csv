05 Nov 2019, 10:11

Keiji Nagai, who had been fighting for nearly two years after the end of the Pacific War in Palau and Peleliu in the Pacific War, died of colorectal cancer on the 4th. I was 98 years old. The farewell ceremony will be at 1 pm on the 8th, Kozuru 42 Memorial Hall Hinuma, Ibaraki, Ibaraki. My home is Kozuru in the same town. The mourner is the eldest son, Hiroshi.
It was the last survivor of 34 people who survived the former Japanese military garrison on the island. In March 2015, he met with the Emperor and Empress of Heisei just before visiting Peleliu. His Majesty said, “It was a very long time and I had a hard time”.
