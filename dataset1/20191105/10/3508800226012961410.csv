常玉、奈良美智香港拍賣會破紀錄天價：藝術創作需要考慮到市場機制嗎？
05 Nov 2019, 10:01 by 陳沛妤


我們想讓你知道的是2019年10月香港拍賣週，日本藝術家奈良美智的《背後藏刀》與中國藝術家常玉的《曲腿裸女》分別創下驚人成交價。當以香港為中心的拍賣會不斷喊出天價時，是否我們該思考藝術與市場的關係，以及台灣現階段在藝術上的處境。



電影《寂寞拍賣師》裡，生活孤僻、神秘的拍賣師佛吉爾擁有高度獨特品味、複雜的人格與近乎潔癖的生活模式，卻得以神奇的操作各種作品的價值與價格，讓人不禁好奇藝術市場的操作究竟是什麼樣的世界？尤其，劇情走向他對愛情的窺探與渴望，當然可以先從他收藏數百幅各個時期女子肖像畫作的房間略知一二。不只是在擁有與操作藝術市場機制的背後，讓他得以獲得想要的物質與金錢，更令人感到病態的是他對女性與藝術的視野與觀感，其實既噁心卻又吸引人想知道他的下場。
然而拍賣、女性、情慾、藝術等條件的組成，會不會是一般大眾所認知的藝術呢？或只是男性霸權影響下的藝術視野？女性與藝術品的買賣關係，是如何讓藝術作品透過美麗的女性肖像而受到重視？
2019年10月香港拍賣週以奈良美智的〈背後藏刀〉與常玉的〈曲腿裸女〉最為人熱議，並創下拍賣價格的驚人紀錄，分別為1.96億港元（約7.73億台幣）和1.98億港元（約合7.82億元新台幣），不僅讓奈良美智擠下草間彌生榮登日本第一貴藝術家，更讓常玉刷新個人最高成交價。這樣令人出乎意料的成果，在香港反送中事件的動亂時期，提供給香港藝術市場較為安心的前景。離香港不遠的台灣，雖然是奈良美智的主要市場，但望著驚人的交易數字，反觀台灣的藝術創作與藝術市場的操作，似乎還有更多可能的發展空間。

而為什麼藝術家的藝術創作需要考慮到藝術市場機制？回顧藝術市場的源頭，約略可以回到1950年代的義裔美籍畫商李歐・卡斯特里（Leo Castelli，1907-1999），他以特殊眼光與執行能力開發許多新興藝術家，並以大量的資源資助尚未走紅的藝術家如羅伯特・勞森伯格（Robert Rauschenberg）、賈斯培・瓊斯（Jasper Johns）、唐納德・賈德（Donald Judd）和羅伊・李奇登斯坦（Roy Lichtenstein）等，因此被視為影響當今藝術銷售與經紀制度的重量級人物。
相較於百年前許多偉大藝術家逝世後才成名，在世時經常窮困潦倒，這樣的操作手法與現象，是否能讓現下生產藝術的品質高漲呢？許多在世的藝術家若能藉著畫廊經營的市場機制達到拍賣價格的巔峰，與藝術在現代人的地位與重視是否能成正比？
邁克爾・斯耶爾森（Michael Shnayerson）於1990年代在一本以美國藝術產業為視角的著作《Boom：Mad Money, Mega Dealers, and the Rise of Contemporary Art》中提到：「藝術世界，從各方面的發展來看，已經變成藝術市場。」以東亞而言，日本藝術家村上隆、草間彌生與奈良美智被視為代表日本的國際三大當代藝術家。值得注意的是，這三人的作品其實只是看似簡單的圖像與觀念，可以單獨在畫布上呈現，卻也適合被製作成大眾文化的商品，形塑了粉絲潮流文化。尤其，知名時尚品牌LV更大方與藝術家合作，將藝術品與商品、上流社會、美感經驗等以高度挑戰性的方式結合，卻創造出獨有的品牌形象。

回到此次拍賣亮點的兩位藝術家，在藝術風格上，以奈良美智的創作中常見的小女孩形象，取材自日本傳統祭典面具—阿多福（Otafuku）和阿龜（Okame），再加上東西方繪畫的筆觸與犀利的眼神，看似無邪又邪惡的面孔，中性的童趣似乎是多元性別時代下搭上潮流的一種呼應。

另一系列關於貓狗的主題則與他個人的性格相關，也在動物議題的時代中趁勝追擊。另一方面，常玉的作品以女體為主題，同樣融合東西方繪畫技巧與帶有寂寞的主題，似乎也成為現代人心中的一個特殊的角落。更特別的是常玉的作品被台灣許多學者書寫與推崇，更奠定了藝術價值的基礎。

在台灣，相較於香港快速又競爭的藝術操作，看似可以大量且快速的獲利，卻相當壓榨藝術家創作的時間與精神性。台灣的藝術家與作品縱使不比許多國際藝術家在香港拍賣會的高價，卻擁有許多獨特的生命力。隸屬台灣各地方文化局的縣市立美術館近年來蓬勃發展，除了原有的台北市立美術館、高雄市立美術館、台東市立美術館、桃園市立美術館、新竹市立美術館到最為熱議的台南市立美術館，以及積極籌備的嘉義市立美術館，其實都有許多優秀的展覽與相關的地方活動。

雖然各地區的收費標準不一，且某些場館對於藝術研究者、學生、藝文工作者並沒有較為友善的優惠，卻依然吸引大批民眾入場。在台中則是以文化部管理的國立台灣美術館最受大眾歡迎，不僅定期更換新展覽，甚至不收任何門票，並在固定的各大雙年展中邀請國內外知名藝術家共襄盛舉。
或許有些人認為台灣這些作品或展覽相較於藝術市場所重視的作品，有許多難以平衡的差異，也或許有人認為台灣的藝術並未受到重視，事實上這些美術館非常努力與積極地舉辦展覽。
有趣的是，願意前來參加的民眾大部分都是藝術相關領域的人士，前來支持朋友圈的展覽，或許有些民眾會走進免費的空間享受親子時光，但也有些人認為藝術是很昂貴的活動，是否要有資金才能參與。種種的矛盾，自藝術誕生以來就不斷存在，至少現階段的藝術活動與藝術市場，讓我們對藝術家擁有更多元的角度看待其生存方式。

Chang Yu, Nara Michi Hong Kong auctions record record price: should art creation take into account the market mechanism?
05 Nov 2019, 10:01 by Chen Peiyu


What we want you to know is the Hong Kong auction week in October 2019. The Japanese artist Nara Michi’s ""The Tibetan Knife"" and the Chinese artist Chang Yu's ""The Legs and Naked Women"" each set an amazing transaction price. When Hong Kong-centered auctions continue to scream for sky-high prices, should we think about the relationship between art and the market, and the current state of art in Taiwan.



In the film ""Lonely Auctioneer"", the lifeless and mysterious auctioneer Foggier has a highly unique taste, complex personality and almost clean life mode, but it can magically manipulate the value and price of various works, making people curious about the art market. What kind of world is the operation? In particular, the plot goes to his prying and eagerness for love. Of course, he can first know a little about his collection of hundreds of portraits of women's portraits of various periods. It is not only behind the mechanism of possessing and operating the art market that allows him to obtain the material and money he wants. What makes him more sick is his vision and perception of women and art. In fact, he is disgusting but attractive to people. The end.
However, will the composition of auctions, women, passions, and art be the art that the general public recognizes? Or is it just an artistic vision under the influence of male hegemony? How does the relationship between women and art trades make art work valued through beautiful female portraits?
In October 2019, the Hong Kong auction week was most popular with Nara's ""Breaking in the knives"" and Chang Yu's ""Budded Nude Girl"", and set an alarming record for the auction price, which was HK$196 million (about 773 million Taiwan dollars). HK$198 million (about NT$782 million) not only allowed Nara Michi to squeeze Kazuo Kusama to be the No. 1 artist in Japan, but also let Changyu refresh his personal highest transaction price. This is an unexpected result, providing a more reassuring prospect for the Hong Kong art market during the turmoil of the incident in Hong Kong. Taiwan, not far from Hong Kong, is the main market for Nara Michi, but looking at the amazing trading figures, there seems to be more room for development in the eyes of Taiwan's art creation and art market operations.

And why does the artist's artistic creation need to take into account the art market mechanism? Looking back at the source of the art market, it is possible to return to the Yi-American art dealer Leo Castelli (1907-1999) in the 1950s. He developed many emerging artists with special vision and execution ability, and The resources funded artists who have not yet become popular, such as Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd, and Roy Lichtenstein. It is considered a heavyweight who influences the current art sales and brokerage system.
Compared with the death of many great artists a hundred years ago, they became famous. When they were in the world, they often became poor and destitute. Can such operation methods and phenomena make the quality of the current production art soar? If many living artists can reach the peak of the auction price through the market mechanism operated by the gallery, can it be directly proportional to the status and importance of art in modern people?
In the 1990s, Michael Shnayerson mentioned in a book ""Boom: Mad Money, Mega Dealers, and the Rise of Contemporary Art"" from the perspective of the American art industry: ""The art world, from each In terms of development, it has become an art market. In East Asia, Japanese artists Takashi Murakami, Yayoi Kusama and Nara Michi are regarded as the three international contemporary artists representing Japan. It is worth noting that the works of these three people are actually only seemingly simple images and concepts. They can be presented on the canvas alone, but they are also suitable for being made into mass culture products, which shape the fan trend culture. In particular, LV, a well-known fashion brand, collaborates with artists to combine art and merchandise, high society, and aesthetic experience in a highly challenging way, but creates a unique brand image.

The two artists who returned to the highlights of the auction, in the artistic style, took the image of the little girl that is common in Nara's creations, based on the traditional Japanese ritual masks—Otafuku and Okame. The brushstrokes and sharp eyes of the Eastern and Western paintings seem to be innocent and evil faces. The neutral childlike interest seems to be an echo of the trend in the multi-gender era.

Another series of themes about cats and dogs is related to his personal character, and he is also victorious in the era of animal issues. On the other hand, Chang Yu's work is based on the female body. It also combines Eastern and Western painting techniques and the theme of loneliness. It seems to be a special corner in the hearts of modern people. What is more special is that Chang Yu's works have been written and praised by many scholars in Taiwan, which has laid the foundation for artistic value.

In Taiwan, compared to Hong Kong's fast and competitive artistic operation, it seems that it can make a large and rapid profit, but it is quite squeezing the time and spirit of the artist's creation. Taiwan’s artists and works, despite the high price of many international artists’ auctions in Hong Kong, have many unique vitalities. The prefectural and municipal art museums affiliated with various local cultural bureaus in Taiwan have flourished in recent years, in addition to the original Taipei City Art Museum, Kaohsiung City Art Museum, Taitung City Art Museum, Taoyuan City Art Museum, Hsinchu City Art Museum, and the most popular Tainan City Art Museum. The Chiayi City Art Museum has many excellent exhibitions and related local events.

Although the fees vary from region to region, and some venues do not have friendly preferences for art researchers, students, and art workers, they still attract large numbers of people to enter. In Taichung, the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, which is managed by the Ministry of Culture, is most popular with the public. It not only replaces new exhibitions on a regular basis, or even receives any tickets, but also invites well-known artists from home and abroad to participate in the permanent biennials.
Perhaps some people think that there are many differences between Taiwan's works or exhibitions that are more important than those of the art market. Some people think that Taiwan's art is not valued. In fact, these art museums work very hard and actively.
Interestingly, most of the people who are willing to come to the exhibition are people in the art-related field. They come to support the exhibition of friends. Maybe some people will walk into the free space to enjoy the family time, but some people think that art is very expensive. Whether there is money to participate in the activities. All kinds of contradictions have existed since the birth of art. At least the current stage of art activities and art market, let us see the way of survival for artists with more yuan.
