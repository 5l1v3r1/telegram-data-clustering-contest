天主教媒體呼籲教廷 加碼台灣牽制中國
05 Nov 2019, 10:27 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者黃雅詩梵蒂岡5日專電）天主教界頗具影響力的十字架報（Crux）近日派記者訪台，一連以多篇報導深入探討台梵關係，3日並發出專論指出，或許現在是教廷加碼對台關係的好時機。
專論認為，中國希望誘使教廷孤立台灣，教廷則渴望促成中國宗教自由，因此教廷外交團隊應思考如何藉著深化與台灣合作關係，拉高手中握有的籌碼，換取對中國談判更有利的條件。
文章中並引用美國知名影集「白宮風雲」（The West Wing）的橋段比喻，談判時只需掌握一張王牌，就能節節進逼對手全盤讓步，在梵中談判裡，教廷手握的關鍵籌碼就是台灣，教廷是台灣在歐洲唯一邦交國，這正好是中國最想要瓦解的關係。
社論指出，相對之下，教廷想從中國獲得的願望清單不少，包括促成中國宗教自由、造福天主教社群，也盼擴及新疆穆斯林與其他受壓迫的宗教。此外，透過梵中關係正常化，教廷希望終結中國官方與非官方教會的長期分裂對抗。
社論說，去年梵中簽署主教任命協議，已讓中國政府掌握控制境內天主教的正當性，接下來對中國政府最有戰略價值的事，就是誘使教廷跟隨國際潮流，在外交上孤立台灣。
教廷外交團隊這時應思考逆向操作，加碼深化與台灣的關係，例如在文化、環保等領域展現共同價值，或任命台灣神職人員擔任教廷重要職缺，藉此提醒中國，教廷手上仍握有重要籌碼，讓世人看到教廷作為國際最重要的「軟實力」，能發揮出乎意料的外交影響力。（編輯：高照芬）1081105

Catholic media appeals to the Holy See to overweight Taiwan to contain China
05 Nov 2019, 10:27 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Huang Yashi Vatican 5th special) The Catholic Influential Cross (Crux) recently sent a reporter to Taiwan, and repeatedly reported on Taiwan-Vatican relations in many reports. On the 3rd, he issued a monograph pointing out that perhaps the Holy See is now overweight. A good time for Taiwan relations.
The monograph believes that China wants to induce the Holy See to isolate Taiwan, and the Holy See is eager to promote Chinese religious freedom. Therefore, the diplomatic team of the Holy See should think about how to deepen the cooperation with Taiwan and raise the bargaining chips in hand, in exchange for more favorable negotiations for China. condition.
The article also quotes the bridge metaphor of the famous American album ""The West Wing"". When you negotiate, you only need to master a trump card, you can make a full concession to the opponent. In the Brahma negotiations, the key to the Holy See The chip is Taiwan, and the Holy See is Taiwan’s only diplomatic country in Europe, which is exactly what China wants to disintegrate.
The editorial pointed out that, in contrast, the Holy See wants to get a list of wishes from China, including promoting religious freedom in China, benefiting the Catholic community, and expanding to Muslims in Xinjiang and other oppressed religions. In addition, through the normalization of Brahman-Chinese relations, the Holy See hopes to end the long-term split confrontation between Chinese officials and unofficial churches.
The editorial said that the signing of the bishop's appointment agreement in the past year has allowed the Chinese government to control the legitimacy of the Catholic Church in China. The next most strategic thing for the Chinese government is to induce the Holy See to follow the international trend and isolate Taiwan diplomatically.
At this time, the diplomatic team of the Holy See should consider reverse operations and increase the relationship with Taiwan, such as showing common values in the fields of culture and environmental protection, or appointing Taiwanese clergy to serve as important members of the Holy See, thereby reminding China that the Holy See still holds important The chips have made the world see the Holy See as the most important ""soft power"" in the world and can exert unexpected diplomatic influence.
