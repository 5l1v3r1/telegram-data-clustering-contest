台原創動畫《重甲機神》耗時12年　導演自爆沒見過聲優
05 Nov 2019, 10:13 by 翁健偉, 陳仁萱
歷經12年終於完成的台灣原創動畫《重甲機神：神降臨》，以動漫族熱愛的日系科幻風，結合了在地的台灣元素，不只讓動漫迷為之騷動，甚至登上了10月號的《物理雙月刊》！在首映會儀式上，請來替這部片配音的聲優一起登場，分享創作的過程。
首度為動畫配音的嚴正嵐，在片中飾演AI人工智慧「派西絲」，她說：「一開始要用冷冰冰的語調來自我介紹會比較卡詞，覺得配音的工作很有趣、也很不過癮，未來還會想挑戰『非人類』的角色！」原本她想多一點可愛的成分，但被導演糾正，盡量不要裝可愛，就算是世界面對毀滅的危機，依然要四平八穩，嚴正嵐：「我以為只要像機器人般平平的方式說話就好，但後來跟導演討論後才將人工智慧『派西絲』設定成是一位少女，除了聲調不能太有情感之外，我還加入一點少女感覺進去，挑戰性蠻高的！」現場她也原音重現大喊：「我是主控電腦派西絲！」


資深聲優康殿宏，以劇中人「太平洋艦隊總司令」身份，歡迎大家前來欣賞電影。

同樣首次為動畫配音的北村豐晴，這次在片中擔任一名海底研究員「朝永航一郎」的日文配音，他坦言最困難之處是要「降齡」演出一位22歲的科技宅男，笑說：「這次配音角色是個20出頭的少年，我一個大叔當下就只能催眠自己是個年輕人，幸好看到電影後覺得自己聲音蠻年輕的，完全不違和！」被問到如何揣摩少年的心境，他表示：「自己超愛《你的名字》，配音時就幻想自己是日本知名聲優神木隆之介！」
除此之外，原先不認識超人氣聲優花澤香菜的他，這次在片中竟演出她的哥哥，北村豐晴驚訝表示：「哇，原來我妹妹這麼厲害耶！」導演黃瀛洲則是在一旁補充：「這次真的非常感謝2位，二話不說就答應獻聲，而且短時間內就協助完成配音工作！」
替本片擔任配樂的陳星翰（Starr Chen），是自投羅網加入陣容，他記得在新聞上看到這部片的消息，就很熱血透過臉書私訊給導演，但石沈大海、整整2個月沒有消息。2個月過去後，才得到對方的回音。他說這是自己首度嘗試電影配樂，「整個過程像是個地獄。」往往跟導演討論到卡關的時候，就假借抽煙的名義溜出去，跑去樓下刺青店。至於跟蔡依林一起做音樂呢？他說：「那是另外一個地獄。」總之兩邊都是地獄，只是不太一樣。

《重甲機神：神降臨》把人類的海底都市，刻意設定在靠近釣魚台附近的海域。導演黃瀛洲說撇開現實中的紛紛擾擾，故事裡頭這裡是全球科學家，一起努力打造出的未來都市，也是回擊外星勢力的基地。另外一位導演紀敦智則說自己幾乎都在埋頭苦幹做動畫，都沒有跟配音的聲優們見到面，今天才終於看到廬山真面目。

No. ""Physical Bimonthly""! At the premiere ceremony, please come to the seiyuu dubbed the film to share the creative process.
Yan Zhengyi, who first dubbed the animation, played the AI artificial wisdom ""Paisisi"" in the film. She said: ""In the beginning, I will use the cold tone to come from the introduction of the card. I think the work of the dubbing is very interesting and very But addiction, I want to challenge the role of ""non-human"" in the future!"" Originally, she wanted to have a little more cute ingredients, but she was corrected by the director. Try not to be cute. Even if the world faces the crisis of destruction, it will still be stable and strict. ""I thought it would be nice to talk like a robot, but after discussing it with the director, I set the artificial wisdom ""Pisi Si"" to be a girl. Besides the tone, I can add a little bit. The girl feels like going in, the challenge is very high!"" At the scene, she also reappeared in the original sound: ""I am the master computer to send Sis!""


Senior voice actor Kang Dianhong, in the role of the ""Pacific Commander-in-Chief"", welcome everyone to come and enjoy the movie.

In the film, Bei Cun Feng Qing, who first voiced the animation, was the Japanese dubbing of a seabed researcher, ""Chang Yong Hang Yi Lang"". He said that the most difficult thing is to ""fall the age"" to perform a 22-year-old technology otaku, laughing. Said: ""This dubbing role is a teenager in his early 20s. I can only hypnotize myself as a young man when I am an uncle. Fortunately, after seeing the movie, I feel that my voice is quite young, and I don't violate it!"" I was asked how to try my mind. He said: ""I love ""Your Name"" by myself. When I dubbed, I imagined that I was a well-known Japanese seiyuu Miki Takano!""
In addition, he didn't know the super-popular scented scented coriander. He actually performed her brother in the film. Bei Cunfeng Qing said with amazement: ""Wow, my sister is so powerful!"" Director Huang Yuzhou added it to the side. ""This time, I really appreciate 2 people. I promised to give my voice without saying anything, and I will help you complete the dubbing work in a short time!""
Starr Chen, who played the soundtrack for this film, joined the lineup from the rookie net. He remembered to see the news in the news, and he was very enthusiastic to give the director a private message through Facebook, but Shi Shenhai, a full 2 No news for the month. After 2 months, I got the response from the other party. He said that this was his first attempt to score a soundtrack. ""The whole process is like hell."" When talking to the director about the card, he sneaked out in the name of smoking and ran to the tattoo shop downstairs. As for making music with Jolin Tsai? He said: ""That is another hell."" In short, both sides are hell, just not the same.

""Heavy Armor God: God's Advent"" deliberately set the human underwater city to the sea near the Diaoyutai. Director Huang Yuzhou said that there are a lot of disturbances in the real world. The story here is a global scientist who works together to create a future city. It is also a base for attacking alien forces. Another director, Ji Dunzhi, said that he was almost all working hard to make animations. He didn't meet the voice singers. Today, I finally saw the true face of Lushan.
