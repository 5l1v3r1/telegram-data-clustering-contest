      <h1>Barcelona still suffering 'post-traumatic stress' four months on from Liverpool defeat</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona were favourites to progress to the Champions League final last season but were knocked out by Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:44:35+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>The Barcelona players are reportedly still in a 'state of shock' four months on from Liverpool's dramatic comeback victory in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants lead <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> by three goals to nil going into the second leg of their semi-final last season. But the Reds hit back at Anfield and inexplicably turned the tie around.</p>
      <p>Divock Origi kick-started proceedings with Liverpool's opener in the seventh minute, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> still had a very healthy 3-1 lead going into the break.</p>
      <p>In the second half the Reds pushed on with dramatic results, and it wasn't long before they doubled their lead through Georginio Wijnaldum.</p>

      <p>The Dutchman bagged his second just two minutes later before Origi - on the same page as the quick-thinking Trent Alexander-Arnold - won Liverpool the tie.</p>
      <p>The Barcelona players have previously spoken out about the effect the defeat had on them.</p>
      <p>But according to fresh reports from Spanish publications AS, Mundo Deportivo and La Vanguardia, via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/team-suffering-post-traumatic-stress-defeat-liverpool-wound-continues-bleed/">Sport Witness,</a> some players are still feeling mentally fragile as a result.</p>

      <p>One report claims certain Barcelona players are 'paralysed four months on' from suffering one of the 'cruelest' defeats in the club's history.</p>
      <p>While another adds that even the new players, like summer signing Antoine Griezmann, are feeling the effects of 'Anfield syndrome'.</p>

      <p>Barcelona were beaten 3-1 by La Liga rivals Levante last time out, conceding a staggering three times in seven minutes.</p>
      <p>The collapse has been attributed to the 'post-traumatic stress' the players are suffering, according to the Spanish media.</p>
