      <h1>Harry Potter Studios is launching a Celebration of Slytherin for summer 2020</h1>
      <h2>Slytherins can finally get their moment in the spotlight and take over Hogwarts for summer 2020 at The Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:15:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>It's time for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-potter">Harry Potter</a> and his friends to step aside - next summer, Slytherins will be ruling the Wizarding World!</p>
      <p>That's because the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter is launching a brand new season paying tribute to the 'most cunning and ambitious' of Hogwarts' houses.</p>
      <p>After all, some of the franchise's most iconic characters were sorted in Slytherin, from Draco Malfoy to Voldemort himself.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/a-celebration-of-slytherin">Celebration of Slytherin</a> will run throughout summer 2020, offering all Harry Potter fans a chance to get a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how the costumes were made.</p>
      <p>There will also be heaps of Slytherin props which were used throughout filming on display - we're hoping there will be plenty of Dark Magic artifacts - this is Slytherin after all!</p>
      <p>Oh, and the Great Hall will be dressed up to celebrate a Slytherin victory of the House Cup with a grand feast and some of the films' original banners decorating the hall.</p>

      <p>It's basically the perfect opportunity for Slytherins to indulge their wicked side while also getting transported into the magic of the Wizarding World.</p>
      <p>Alongside the tribute to Slytherin, the Studios Tour will still offer all of its usual magical sets and props, whether you want to wander through the Forbidden Forest, check out Snape's Potion class, meet magical creatures or even re-create some of the special effects which were used in the films.</p>
