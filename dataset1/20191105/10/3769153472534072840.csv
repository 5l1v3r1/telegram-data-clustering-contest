You will often see Blender as part of a workflow for architectural projects where it receives 3D Data for visualization from softwares like Revit, ArchiCAD, and BricsCAD. Those softwares will use BIM technology to develop architecture and engineering projects further.A free Add-on may invert the project development workflow and make Blender provide 3D data for such tools. As a brilliant effort from developer Dion Moult, an exporter that will allow Blender to generate IFC files is under development.An IFC file can describe 3D data from BIM (Building Information Modeling). It is a great format to exchange information between BIM tools. Nowadays, you can import IFC files to Blender using the ifcOpenShell and Python.With the new IFC Exporter for Blender, you will be able to create files compatible with a BIM workflow. That will open a world of opportunities for architects and engineers working with Blender. Not to mention new business opportunities for Blender users, like providing content for project development.For instance, you will be able to create furniture models that will fit into a project developer in Revit.The Add-on is still in the early stages of development, but it already works. You can try it yourself by downloading the latest release from Github.
