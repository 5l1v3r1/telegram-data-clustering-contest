      <h1>Asian Shooting Championship: Manu Bhaker wins 10m air pistol gold</h1>

      <p>DOHA: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/manu-bhaker">Manu Bhaker</a> claimed the women's 10m air pistol gold medal in the 14th Asian Championship on Tuesday, while birthday boy Deepak Kumar secured India's 10th Olympic quota in shooting.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old Bhaker shot 244.3 to win the top prize in her event. The Haryana sensation, though, had already secured an Olympic quota at the Munich World Cup in May.</p>
      <p>China's Qian wang and Ranxin Jiang won the silver and bronze respectively in Bhaker's event.</p>
      <p>The other Indian competing in the event, Yashaswini Singh Deshwal finished sixth in the final.</p>
      <p>The third Indian in the fray, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Annu-Raj-Singh">Annu Raj Singh</a> shot 569 for a 20th place finish.</p>
      <p>The Indian trio claimed the team bronze with a total of 1731, behind Korea and China respectively.</p>
      <p>Deepak gifted himself a bronze medal in the 10m air rifle on the opening day of the championship.</p>
      <p>The Jakarta Asian Games silver medallist shot 227.8 in the eight-man final to finish third on the podium and add to India's quotas for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Deepak, who turned 32 on Tuesday, qualified for the final in third place at the Lusail Shooting Complex after registering a sequence of scores that read 103.1, 104.8, 104.6, 105.0, 105.6, 103.7, giving him an aggregate of 626.8.</p>
      <p>The rifleman, who won a bronze medal at the 2018 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ISSF-World-Cup">ISSF World Cup</a> in Guadalajara last year, started the final with a 8.9, but roared back with nine straight scores of 10 and above to sit in third place after the first competition stage.</p>
      <p>He continued to shoot well in the ensuing attempts and gifted himself a medal and his country a quota on the opening day of the prestigious tournament.</p>
      <p>Deepak is the second Indian shooter to earn an Olympic quota in the men's 10m air rifle event after Divyansh Singh Panwar, who secured it in April.</p>
      <p>China's Yukun Liu (250.5) claimed the gold medal after his incredible performance saw him shoot 10 and above in all the attempts.</p>
      <p>The silver went to Haonan Yu (249.1), also a Chinese. However, China already has earned two quotas in the same event, so they are not entitled to get any more. A maximum of two Olympic berths can be won by a country per event.</p>
      <p>Deepak was the most experienced of the three Indian shooters in the fray, the others being Kiran Ankush Jadhav and Yash Vardhan, who finished 14th and 30th respectively.</p>
      <p>Divyansh and Sanjeev Rajput -- both have secured quotas in earlier events -- shot in the Minimum Qualification Score (MQS) category.</p>
      <p>The Junior Trap Mixed team pairing of Vivaan Kapoor and Manisha Keer also won a gold as India rounded off a profitable opening day at the Lusail Shooting Complex with five medals.</p>
      <p>In the women's 10m Air Rifle, the Indian trio of Elavenil Valarivan, Anjum Moudgil and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Apurvi-Chandela">Apurvi Chandela</a> won the team silver with a combined effort of 1883.2, finishing behind Korea (1891.7). Iran won the bronze.</p>
      <p>Elavenil also made it through to the individual final, placing fifth eventually with a score of 187.1. She had earlier shot a solid 629 in qualification to make it to the finals in fourth place.</p>
      <p>Anjum Moudgil missed making the finals narrowly, finishing ninth with a score of 627.6 while Apurvi Chandela finished 12th with 626.6.</p>
      <p>India entered the tournament having secured nine Tokyo Olympics quotas in rifle and pistol events.</p>
      <p>China are currently leading the charts with 25 quotas and is followed by Korea and hosts Japan with 12 slots each, in terms of quotas won.</p>
      <p>With 38 quotas on offer, the country is fielding a 41-member team — six entries for Minimum Qualification Score (MQS) — across the 15 Olympic events.</p>
      <p>The tournament is the last chance for shooters to earn quotas for the Tokyo Olympics, slated for next July-August.</p>
