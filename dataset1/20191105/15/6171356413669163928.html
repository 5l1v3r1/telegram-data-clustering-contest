      <h1>Motorola One Power among the first Motos to receive Android 10 beta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:15:08+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/jules-wang/" target="_blank">Jules Wang</a></address>
      <p>Adoption rates for new versions of Android have increased over the past couple of cycles and it helps that <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/24/one-ui-2-beta-note10-s10/">OEMs are showing up early</a> with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/03/oneplus-releases-android-10-open-betas-for-7-and-7-pro/">Android 10 beta programs</a> earlier than ever before. Motorola, though, has generally been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/17/android-pie-kernel-source-now-available-for-moto-x4-moto-p30-play-and-motorola-one/">on</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/26/motorola-drops-plans-to-release-z2-force-pie-update-on-sprint-t-mobile-and-att/">off</a> the ball with how it updates its devices — nevermind <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/02/11/18-after-it-was-promised-moto-g4-plus-gets-updated-to-android-oreo/">which devices</a> get updated — but it may still come as a surprise that one of its first phones now testing Android 10 is the Motorola One Power.</p>

      <p>For context, the first two Moto phones to get Android 9 Pie last year were the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/28/android-pie-is-now-rolling-out-to-the-motorola-one-and-one-power-globally/">Motorola One and Motorola One Power</a> — both Android One devices with expedited update timelines. We're still a bit quizzical to see the Power grab an Android 10 beta ahead of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/19/moto-z4-review/">all the other phones</a> the company released in the past year.</p>
      <p>Android Police reader Lucas told us that Motorola has started distributing Android 10 beta builds to Power owners enrolled with the <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Forum-Feedback/We-need-you-for-the-MFN-Oportunity/td-p/3064626">Motorola Feedback Network</a>. We're not exactly sure how wide the geographical spread is for this OTA — Motorola has historically soaked OS upgrades in Latin America before other regions, but we can't say that's the case for sure here.</p>

      <p>Build version QPT30.52-2 sticks with the October 5 level security patch (even though it's still labeled as October 1). Google Pay is also noted to be non-functional with the update, but Motorola is working on it.</p>
      <p>Still, one small step toward Android 10 for the Motorola One Power doesn't mean an immediate giant leap for the rest of the Moto lineup.</p>
