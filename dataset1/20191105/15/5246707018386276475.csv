""The biggest Fortnite content pack ever""

Despite being an online-based, digital-only game, Fortnite has today been treated to its second physical release on Nintendo Switch and other platforms.
Called Fortnite: Darkfire Bundle, this release is an all-new retail version of the game which comes with a recommended retail price of £25 (although we've already seen it cheaper on sites like Amazon). It features £70 worth of in-game content with 13 items being offered in total.
Of course, if you do opt to pick this up physically, you'll find a download code waiting for you in the box with no cartridge. You can also grab it directly from the eShop.
Here's what you get:

Dark Power Chord Outfit
Shadow Ark Outfit
Molten Omen Outfit
Dark Angular Shift Wrap
Molten Angular Shift Wrap
Shadow Angular Shift Wrap
Dark Six String Back Bling
Molten Battle Shroud Back Bling
Shadow Ark Wings Back Bling
Dark Strikers Dual-Wielding Pickaxe
Molten Strikers Dual-Wielding Pickaxe
Shadow Strikers Dual-Wielding Pickaxe
Unification Emote




A similar bundle appeared in stores around this time last year called Fortnite: Deep Freeze Bundle, which was released at the same price point. At this rate, collectors will soon be able to have a small series of physical releases for this digital-only phenomenon. Gaming's weird, huh?
