Barn Park End roof repaired after Plymouth Argyle's last home game was called off
The fixture against Grimsby on Saturday was postponed less than three hours before kick-off

Repair work to part of the roof at the Barn Park End at Plymouth Argyle’s Home Park stadium has been successfully carried out.
It follows the postponement of the Pilgrims’ League Two game against Grimsby Town on Saturday due to the structural damage.
A section of the roof became loose after overnight gales battered Plymouth.
Repairs could not be carried out on Saturday because the winds remained too strong for any closer inspection and work to be done.
No further damage to the roof has been identified after a closer assessment by structural engineers.
The Argyle squad trained on the pitch at Home Park on Tuesday morning as they prepared for the FA Cup first round tie at Bolton Wanderers this Saturday.
No date has been announced yet for the rearranged game against Grimsby.
As it stands, Argyle's next match at Home Park will be on Saturday, November 23, when Bradford City will be the visitors for a League Two fixture.
