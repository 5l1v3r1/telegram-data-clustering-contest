      <h2>Chef Gary Trice's 21-year-old colleague fell on a broom handle at the Rainforest Adventure in College Milton, piercing his anus and leaving him in excruciating pain.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:58:32+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">East Kilbride News, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/east-kilbride-news/</a></address>
      <p>A chef has avoided prison after a kitchen prank led to a young colleague suffering horrific internal injuries.</p>
      <p>Gary Trice tricked Lewis Mitchell into climbing on to a fridge and placed a broom handle underneath him.</p>
      <p>The unwitting 21-year-old lost his grip and fell on to the handle which pierced his anus, leaving him in excruciating pain.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at Rainforest Adventure soft play facility in Glenburn Road, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride,</a> in February 2016.</p>
      <p>Trice, 29, of John Neilson Avenue, Paisley, was ordered to do 220 hours of unpaid community work when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court this week.</p>

      <p>He admitted culpable and reckless conduct which caused Mr Mitchell severe injury.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the victim has since received more than £250,000 in compensation from the company which runs the soft play centre.</p>
      <p>Vish Kathuria, prosecuting, said Trice was in charge of the centre’s kitchen in the absence of the head chef while Mr Mitchell, a university student, was working as a porter.</p>
      <p>A Facebook video had been circulating which showed a workplace prank where an employee dangled from a peg in a wall, unable to lower himself because a broom handle had been placed directly under him.</p>
      <p>Looking to play a similar practical joke, Trice asked Mr Mitchell to pull himself up to the top of a fridge to fetch some cupcake holders.</p>
      <p>As the porter did this, Trice placed a broom handle directly under his bottom.</p>

      <p>Mr Kathuria told the court: “Mr Mitchell lost his grip and as he fell the broom handle tore through his trousers and underwear, penetrating his anus.</p>
      <p>“It perforated his intestine and stopped just short of his stomach.</p>
      <p>“He felt excrutiating pain travelling through him and screamed out as he fell into the arms of the accused.”</p>
      <p>Blood was gushing from his anus and he was rushed to hospital for immediate surgery.</p>
      <p>Mr Mitchell was in hospital for ten days and had another operation in October that year.</p>
      <p>Mr Kathuria added: “He was in constant pain to the extent that he had to defer his second year at university.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent Neal McShane said Trice, a first offender, wished to apologise publicly for the “reckless act”.</p>
      <p>He added: “My client has not been in trouble since this highly unfortunate matter.</p>
      <p>“I’m aware the complainer in this case took out a civil action against the company in the Court of Session.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had confirmation from company representatives that there has been a settlement figure in excess of £250,000.”</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Sheriff David Bicket told Trice: “I appreciate this was not malicious, but it was extremely reckless and had tragic consequences for the person concerned.</p>
      <p>“You have no analogous record and because of that and the terms of the background report I can deal with this other than by imposing custody.</p>
      <p>“Having said that, it would merit custody in other circumstances.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff told Trice unpaid work was a direct alternative and if he fails to do it a prison sentence will be “uppermost“ in the court’s mind.</p>
