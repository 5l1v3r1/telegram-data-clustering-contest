In total, ""259 people had been detained and asked for help when we arrived,"" Mr Olugbenga said, adding that children, teenagers, adults and one woman with a baby are among the saved people.

The owner of the house and eight others have been arrested, but ""investigations are still ongoing to find out more,"" added Mr Olugbenga.
