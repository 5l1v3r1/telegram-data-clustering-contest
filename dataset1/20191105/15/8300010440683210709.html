      <p>SHERMAN, Texas -- This is just one of the key plays that high school senior Gage Smith did at their game against West Mesquite on Friday.<br/><br/>But it's what Smith did after the game that most people remember.<br/><br/>"When you're playing the game, you're playing to win and the other team is the enemy. But, afterward, you still have respect for the other opponent."<br/><br/>Smith said he knows West Mesquite player Ty Jordan from a previous team they both played on.<br/><br/>Jordan's mom is battling cancer and Smith asked to pray with him after the game.<br/><br/>"I just had a moment with him, praying over him, his mom, and his family," Smith said.<br/><br/>Smith says in that moment it was not about the score or being opponents, it was about showing compassion.<br/><br/>Jordan's aunt posted the pictures on Facebook expressing how much the gesture meant to their family.</p>
