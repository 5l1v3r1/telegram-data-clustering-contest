Man Is Fatally Stabbed Over Popeyes Chicken Sandwich
05 Nov 2019, 15:37 by Derrick Bryson Taylor
The authorities are searching for an unidentified man who they say fatally stabbed another man in an altercation while waiting for the new Popeyes chicken sandwich in Maryland on Monday night. The police are also searching for a woman who is wanted for questioning.
Kevin Tyrell Davis, 28, who had cut a line designated specifically for customers ordering the sandwich, was confronted by another customer once he reached the counter, Chief Hank Stawinski of the Prince George’s County Police Department said at a news conference on Tuesday.
An argument broke out, and seconds later Mr. Davis was stabbed once in the upper body, the police said, adding that they found a knife at the scene. The attacker and the woman fled the scene in a car, the police said.



The violence struck a startling contrast with the excitement around the chain’s much-hyped sandwich, which has led to long lines around the country, hiccups in availability and a flurry of memes, as well as a marketing battle between Popeyes and Chick-fil-A.
The stabbing occurred in Oxon Hill, Md., about nine miles south of Capitol Hill in Washington.
“The questions my detectives have to answer is how does a confrontation lead to a homicide in 15 seconds,” Chief Stawinski said, calling the crime “pointless” and “horrible.”
The two men were not associated with each other before the crime, the police said.
Around 7 p.m., the police responded to a call of a fight between two men inside a Popeyes restaurant, Jennifer Donelan, a spokeswoman for the Prince George’s County Police Department, said at a news conference Monday night. The argument spilled out onto the street, she said.
Mr. Davis was rushed to a hospital, where he died from his injuries, Ms. Donelan said.
“We have been able to determine that, preliminarily, that this is related to the release of the sandwich,” Ms. Donelan said, adding that the man had been in line to buy the sandwich.
The authorities have asked anyone who was inside the restaurant at the time of the fight to contact the police with any information. The police have also urged the man who carried out the stabbing to come forward.
“For you to get that angry over anything, for that type of anger to develop into this type of violence, again is a very sad and tragic day,” Ms. Donelan said. “And that person needs to turn themselves in.”
“We are very sad to hear about the tragedy in Maryland tonight,” a spokeswoman for Popeyes said in a statement on Tuesday. “We do not yet know whether this was the result of a dispute over one of our products or something unrelated, but there is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot. Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.”
The chicken sandwich craze hit in August and quickly drew long lines around the country. The popularity of the sandwich also prompted a debate on social media about whether Chick-fil-A or Popeyes had the best version of it.
However, the sandwich blitz hit a snag when Popeyes said it could no longer keep up with the demand, and the product went on hiatus.
The chain announced late last month that the sandwich would return on Sunday, Nov. 3, which also happened to be National Sandwich Day, according to CNN.
