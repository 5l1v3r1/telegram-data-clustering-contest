Siyabonga Meyiwa – the brother of the late former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa, says he has trust in AfriForum to help his family to speed up the process of the player’s murder investigation. 
It has been five years since Meyiwa was gunned down in 2014 in a house at Vosloorus in Gauteng, and no one has been jailed and sentenced for the brutal and senseless act.
