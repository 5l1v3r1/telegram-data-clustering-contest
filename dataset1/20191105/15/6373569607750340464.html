      <h1>Barn Park End roof repaired after Plymouth Argyle's last home game was called off</h1>
      <h2>The fixture against Grimsby on Saturday was postponed less than three hours before kick-off</h2>

      <p>Repair work to part of the roof at the Barn Park End at Plymouth Argyle’s Home Park stadium has been successfully carried out.</p>
      <p>It follows the postponement of the Pilgrims’ League Two game against Grimsby Town on Saturday due to the structural damage.</p>
      <p>A section of the roof became loose after overnight gales battered Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Repairs could not be carried out on Saturday because the winds remained too strong for any closer inspection and work to be done.</p>
      <p>No further damage to the roof has been identified after a closer assessment by structural engineers.</p>
      <p>The Argyle squad trained on the pitch at Home Park on Tuesday morning as they prepared for the FA Cup first round tie at Bolton Wanderers this Saturday.</p>
      <p>No date has been announced yet for the rearranged game against Grimsby.</p>
      <p>As it stands, Argyle's next match at Home Park will be on Saturday, November 23, when Bradford City will be the visitors for a League Two fixture.</p>
