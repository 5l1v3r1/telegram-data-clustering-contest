      <h1>Saskatchewan granted intervener status in First Nations TMX project appeal</h1>
      <h2>Saskatchewan says the court is to hear the appeal in December</h2>

      <p>The Saskatchewan government says it has been granted leave to intervene in an appeal over construction of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.</p>
      <p>The province says it is intervening in support of the federal government by arguing that the expansion project was properly approved.</p>
      <p>The Federal Court of Appeal in British Columbia ruled in September that it would hear six challenges focusing on Indigenous consultation.</p>
      <p>Ottawa twice approved the plan, but the Federal Court of Appeal tore up the original approval last year, citing insufficient environmental review and inadequate Indigenous consultations.</p>
      <p>The Liberal government said they fixed the problems and approved the expansion a second time in June.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Justice Minister Don Morgan says the province will make submissions to the court about the need to balance a duty to consult with matters of public interest, such as transportation infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“Projects like Trans Mountain create a stronger economy that allow the federal and provincial governments to invest in programs and initiatives like health and education,” he said in a release Monday.</p>
      <p>The pipeline project would triple the capacity of an existing pipeline from Alberta’s oilpatch to a terminal in Burnaby, B.C.</p>
