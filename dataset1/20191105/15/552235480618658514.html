      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-news">Kilmarnock’s</a> iconic Palace Theatre and Grand Hall have been flagged up as in danger with crumbling stonework and rain leaking in.</p>
      <p>It will cost between £6 million and £8m to ensure the long-term future of the landmarks, according to a bombshell <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-ayrshire-council">East Ayrshire Council</a> report.</p>
      <p>The theatre could close for a year to allow the essential work to be carried out.</p>
      <p>So far protective netting has been placed over vulnerable stonework.</p>
      <p>A report on the condition of council buildings, which will go before councillors this week, flagged the theatre and hall up as ‘red’ which means they are underperforming.</p>
      <p>The report said: “The two red-flagged buildings requiring major investment to improve are the Palace Theatre and Grand Hall.”</p>

      <p>The paper said they are “both landmark buildings within central Kilmarnock” and “contribute significantly to the architectural heritage of the town centre”.</p>
      <p>Conservation architects said a new drainage system is necessary to divert rainwater away.</p>
      <p>Once the leakage problem is sorted out the stonework will be able to dry, which will then allow it to be fixed up.</p>
      <p>Drainage work costing £200,000 could start this year.</p>
      <p>Other improvements needed in the long term include work on the theatre ceiling and upgrade of mechanical and electrical installation.</p>
      <p>The council report said: “It is currently estimated that the cost of these together with works to the external fabric, drainage and internal alterations and remodelling will be in the region of £6 million to £8 million.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>All building work needs the approval of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Historic Environment Scotland.</p>
      <p>Major refurbishment and maintenance has taken place over the decades. In 2011 £1.4m was spent on roofing, stonework and refurbishment.</p>
      <p>The report said: “It should also be noted that the extent of internal works would require the planned closure of the building for about a year and would require consultation with appropriate stakeholders to agree a programme for the works.”</p>
      <p>Councillors will vote on whether repairs and improvement works can go ahead this week.</p>
