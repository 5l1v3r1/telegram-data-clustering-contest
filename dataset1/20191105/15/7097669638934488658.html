      <h1>Man pulled from train tracks at last second after falling in California</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:16:37+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Clark Mindock</a></address>
      <p>Dramatic video shows a last-second rescue of a man just before getting hit by a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/train">train</a> in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/oakland">Oakland</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/California">California</a>.</p>
      <p>The man was grabbed by a station employee at a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) station that was crowded following an <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NFL">NFL</a> football game on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>In the video, the employee can be seen snatching up the man as he appears to misstep and fall over the yellow safety strip just as a train approaches.</p>
      <p>The hero transportation worker has since been identified as BART transportation supervisor John O’Connor, who had been stationed on the platform to help with crowd control following a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/raiders">Raiders</a> game.</p>
      <p>In video taken by others on the platform and posted online, Mr O’Connor and the man he saved can be seen embracing after the incident.</p>
      <p>“He was sitting right there and he put his hand out and that’s when I’m like, dude, you almost didn’t make it,” Mr O’Connor <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/04/hero-worker-who-saved-fallen-man-from-approaching-bart-train-to-speak-to-reporters/">later told</a> KPIX 5.</p>
      <p>Describing the rescue, he said: “The young man just walked, I saw out of the corner of my eye I saw him going in the trackway. He came to the side, and I figured out he wasn’t going to make it. So I grabbed him, pulled him up on the platform.”</p>
