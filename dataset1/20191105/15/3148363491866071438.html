      <h1>Trump Jr: 'Mitt Romney Is My Favorite Democrat' | Breitbart</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:06:25+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Trent Baker</a></address>
      <p>Tuesday on CBS’s “This Morning” as part of his book tour for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X">“Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,”</a> President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., revealed his favorite Democrat: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).</p>
      <p>After the younger Trump was urged to “say something nice” on Twitter as the interview wrapped up, co-host Gayle King asked him to name his favorite Democrat.</p>
      <p>Trump thought to himself for a moment and then jokingly replied, “Mitt Romney is my favorite Democrat.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Partial exchange as follows:</i>
      </p>
      <blockquote>KING: Who is your favorite Democrat? Go ahead. TRUMP JR.: Ooh. KING: OK. Alright … we’re going to let you go. Thank you very much. It is now 8:14. The name of the book is ‘Triggered,’ wherever you like to buy your books. TRUMP JR.: Mitt Romney, Gayle. Mitt Romney is my favorite Democrat. How about that? KING: No. Time to check your local weather.</blockquote>
