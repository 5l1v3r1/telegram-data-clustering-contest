It has a 14nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset under the hood, paired with 4GB RAM and 64GB of expandable storage.
In the camera department, the Nokia 6.2 has a triple camera array at the back with a 16MP primary sensor. You also get an 8MP sensor for ultra-wide shots and a 5MP sensor for depth-sensing. Some of the other key features of the Android One smartphone include an 8MP selfie camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, 3,500mAh battery, and a USB Type-C port. Being an Android One phone, the Nokia 6.2 is guaranteed to get monthly security updates for three years and OS update for two years.
