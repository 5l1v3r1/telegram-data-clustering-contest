      <p>MADISON, Wis. - One person is dead after being hit by a car near U.S. Highway 12/18 and Millpond Road Monday night, according to Madison police.</p>
      <p>The crash happened at approximately 7:05 p.m. Monday. The highway was blocked off until 12:14 a.m. Tuesday while police officers, investigators, a sergeant and a traffic crash specialist were on scene.</p>
      <p>The road will be open for the Tuesday morning commute.</p>
      <p>While investigating the crash, police arrested 37-year-old Shuan T. Jones on tentative charges of Knowingly Operating While Revoked Causing Death, Ignition Interlock Device Tampering, Failure to Install and Resisting/Obstructing an Officer. The vehicle Jones was driving was also recovered by police.</p>
