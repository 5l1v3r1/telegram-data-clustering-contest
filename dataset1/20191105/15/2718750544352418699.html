      <p>Children cannot go blissfully from one candy-filled holiday to another without getting a little humbling from the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/07/danny-elfman-on-8-of-his-iconic-scores.html">Pumpkin King</a> himself, Jimmy Kimmel. The late-night host brought back his annual Halloween candy prank, where parents tell their sleep-deprived and candy-hungover children that they’ve eaten all their Halloween candy. Rightfully, they erupt into anger, most of them so pissed you can’t even understand what they’re saying. Others take it out on the poor, empty plastic pumpkins. Some kids are ready to tear their entire families apart. “That’s so rude of you,” one kid lectures his mother. “Tomorrow, I’m going to eat your stuff for real and I’m not going to give you no goodies, just Papi.” Seems like a fair punishment!</p>
