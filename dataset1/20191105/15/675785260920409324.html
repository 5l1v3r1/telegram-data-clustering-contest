      <h1>Boris Becker's bankruptcy extended by 12 years after hiding £4.5million worth of assets and transactions</h1>
      <h2>The six-time Grand Slam champion had previously been made bankrupt for just a year after failing to pay back creditors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:47:14+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-becker">Boris Becker's</a> bankruptcy has been extended by a further 12 years until 2031 after it was discovered he had hidden £4.5 million worth of assets and transactions.</p>
      <p>The tennis legend was declared bankrupt in June 2017, with the period only initially due to last one year.</p>
      <p>However, as reported by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7651605/Boris-Becker-remain-bankrupt-2031.html">the Mail</a> , the failure of Becker, 51, to disclose all of his assets to the Official Receiver has led to that period being lengthened as punishment.</p>
      <p>As a result, Becker cannot borrow more than £500 without informing the lender that he is bankrupt; is unable to be a company director; and requires court permission to have any say in the running of a company.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Insolvency service said: "The Official Receiver investigated undisclosed transactions occurring before and after the bankruptcy proceedings, totalling over £4.5million.</p>

      <p>"Bankruptcy restrictions are usually lifted after a year but, owing to the nature of Boris Becker's actions, the Official Receiver pursued extended restrictions to prevent Mr Becker causing further harm to his creditors.</p>
      <p>"Mr Becker offered a Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking, which was accepted on October 17, 2019 and lasts until October 16, 2031."</p>
      <p>Anthony Hannon, Public Interest Official Receiver for the Insolvency Service, said: "Bankrupts have a duty to fully cooperate with their trustee and where this has been frustrated, a bankruptcy restriction undertaking of commensurate length must reflect that conduct."</p>
      <p>Becker was originally made bankrupt at London's High Court on June 21, 2017, but protested he was not allowed sufficient time to settle his debt, after failing to pay £3.3 million to private banking firm Arbuthnot Latham.</p>
      <p>At the time he labelled the case against him a "gravy train for the suits", and added that he "will be coming after the people who forced this process through."</p>
      <p>He had been forced to auction off a number of personal belongings from his playing career, including his trophy for winning the 1989 US Open, which drew a bid of over £150,000.</p>

      <p>Among the 82 items of memorabilia up for sale by the six-time Grand Slam winner were a watch given to him as a gift by Novak Djokovic, with the auction raising £680,000 in total.</p>
      <p>The auction was due to take place last year, but it was postponed as Becker claimed to have taken up a role with the Central African Republic (CAR) as a sports ambassador, and thus claimed diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
      <p>Yet this was countered by the CAR's foreign minister Charles-Armel Doubane, who stated that Becker was "not an official diplomat", the role did not exist, and the CAR passport he held was among a number that had been stolen.</p>
      <p>Businessman Stephan Welk - who provided Becker with the passport - was detained for possible fraud earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Becker's mansion in Mallorca also remains up for sale for £9 million, but is currently inhabited by a squatter, who claims that no one will pay for it.</p>
      <p>It is still listed by local property firms but it has become run down since being abandoned by Becker.</p>
