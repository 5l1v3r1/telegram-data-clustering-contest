      <p>The Harney County, Oregon, sheriff department has released the final results of its investigation into the high-speed crash of the North American Eagle during a land-speed record attempt in late August. According to the department's press release, first reported by <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/04/fastest-woman-jessi-combs-fatal-crash-cause-front-wheel-failure-death/">TMZ</a>, the front wheel experienced mechanical failure, "most likely caused from striking an object on the desert. The front wheel failure led to the front wheel assembly collapsing."</p>

      <p>The report stated that the failure occurred at "speeds approaching 550 mph," and the cause of Combs's death was determined to have been blunt-force trauma to the head that occurred before the fire that engulfed the land-speed-record vehicle.</p>
      <p>The press release was dated September 17, but a sheriff department spokesperson told <i>C/D</i> that it was not made public until now while waiting for the medical examiner's report to confirm, which has now occurred.</p>
