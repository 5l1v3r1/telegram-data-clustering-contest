      <p>TOKYO: Japan's Rakuten said on Tuesday (Nov 5) it expects to take a 103 billion yen (US$947 million) loss in the latest quarter on its investment in US ride-hailing firm Lyft.</p>
      <p>The e-retailer, whose billionaire founder and Chief Executive Hiroshi Mikitani has a seat on Lyft's board, recorded the charge because Lyft shares had "fallen significantly" over the July-September period, it said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>

      <p>Rakuten, the biggest shareholder in Lyft with a stake of more than 11 per cent, is scheduled to announce financial results on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The write-down adds to a 28.4 billion yen unrealised loss on Rakuten's Lyft stake for the April-June quarter, with the ride-hailing service locked in a money-burning price war with larger rival Uber Inc in the United States.</p>
      <p>At its own earnings presentation last week, Lyft said a growing number of customers were now paying full price for rides, and the improved outlook showed it was on track to be profitable by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>Still, the stock has lost about 40 per cent of its value since the company's initial public offering in March.</p>
