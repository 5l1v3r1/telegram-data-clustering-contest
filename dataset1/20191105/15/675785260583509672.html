      <h2>Liverpool, aiming for a third straight Group E win, cannot afford to drop points at Anfield on Tuesday against Genk</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:28:34+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool will make light work of their Champions League encounter with Genk despite not being "at their best", according to Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas.</p>
      <p>The Reds, aiming for a third straight Group E win, cannot afford to drop points at Anfield on Tuesday against the Belgian champions.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side have beaten Salzburg and Genk since launching their European title defence with defeat in Napoli, while Sadio Mane's last-gasp goal at Aston Villa on Saturday kept them top of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Klopp will surely have one eye on Sunday's home clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> when finalising his squad for Tuesday's tie., meaning he may well rest star players including Mohamed Salah.</p>

      <p>And Nicholas reckons even if the German opts for a weakened team, they should still have enough in attack to secure another group stage victory.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are not at their best,â€™ Nicholas told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11854262/charlie-nicholas-champions-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a> . "People might suggest that once they get going, they will be ruthless, but they are getting away with it currently.</p>
      <p>"The Napoli and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> matches were reality checks, but they could have been two or three down by the time they rescued things at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool have a dramatic amount of games coming up. Mohamed Salah was really average at the weekend, as was Roberto Firmino, so Jurgen Klopp may leave a couple out and change it up.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be a fairly comfortable night nevertheless for Liverpool."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Genk coach Felice Mazzu insists his squad are not at Anfield to "take photos" but did admit he had brought every available player because the match was a great moment for the club.</p>
      <p>The Belgian club were beaten 4-1 at home by Jurgen Klopp's side a fortnight ago and have yet to win any of the 15 matches they have played in their relatively small Champions League history.</p>
      <p>A 2-0 defeat against struggling Eupen at the weekend was not the ideal preparation and Mazzu knows his players have to massively improve if they are not to be rolled over again.</p>
      <p>"I brought everyone because I think it is a great moment for the club, for all the players, so my desire was that everyone is here," he said.</p>

      <p>"It is the moment to enjoy but not to be here to take photos. It is to give their life on the pitch and play the best football possible.</p>
      <p>"They play a big game against a big team perhaps for once in our life in a place like this.</p>
      <p>"I know the results are not so good and the way we have played is not so good. I know it's not an easy moment but I am calm. I don't feel the pressure.</p>
      <p>"We play against the best team in the world at the moment. I am sure the players' mentality will be better tomorrow - and I hope the coach's also."</p>
