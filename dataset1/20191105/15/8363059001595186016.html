      <p>After toying with the idea of a smartwatch in the past, OnePlus could finally be making one.</p>
      <p>A tweet from TechPP writer <a href="https://twitter.com/techauntyji/status/1190606119145623553">Tech Auntyji</a> seems to indicate that OnePlus has something brewing, with a reference to a fitness-related wearable. While the brand isn't mentioned outright, it's 'Never Settle' slogan was directly referenced, leaving little doubt as to which tech company was being hinted at.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/OnePlus-watch-release-date_id120145">PhoneArena</a> goes one step further, citing a leak the suggests the wearable - whether it's a fitness band or the smartwatch that was previously in development - will be launching alongside next year's <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/oneplus-8-leaked-renders/">OnePlus 8</a> in, which is expected to make its debut in May at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Either way, it's a not a lot of information to go on, and it's not clear if OnePlus has resurrected its smartwatch, or if it's branching out into new territory with a fitness wearble, but it's a company that likes to share, so no doubt we'll hear more from its own mouth soon enough.
