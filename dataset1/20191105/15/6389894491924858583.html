      <p>Speaking on Nick Ferrari’s LBC radio show yesterday, Rees-Mogg said that if either of them had been in the burning building, “we would leave…It just seems like the common sense thing to do”.</p>
      <p>Rees-Mogg apologised for the comments this morning in a statement to the Evening Standard:</p>
      <p>“I profoundly apologise,” he said. “What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade’s advice to stay and wait at the time.</p>
      <p>“However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn’t and I don’t think anyone else would.</p>
      <p>“I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments.”</p>
      <p>Stormzy also said that the government should take the blame for the tragedy, not the fire brigade:</p>
      <p>“The government are to blame for grenfell not the fire brigade. Point blank. I don’t know the ins and outs and I’m sure the fire fighters made some errors, to what extent I don’t know but nah we ain’t gonna act like the brave men and women who went in there are the main reason…</p>
      <p>“this happened get the fuck out of here Lmao we ain’t that dumb lads This is blood on the British governments hands. Grenfell was their fault and their fault alone.”</p>

      <p>The initial findings of an inquiry into what happened at Grenfell criticised the LFB for its role in the disaster.</p>
      <p>Sir Martin Moore-Bick’s first report from the inquiry said the LFB should have told people to leave the building and that firefighters were ill-equipped to deal with the situation.</p>
