      <p>NEW YORK: Phoenix's Devin Booker scored 40 points to lead the Suns over visiting Philadelphia 114-109 on Monday (Nov 4), delivering the first loss of the season to the NBA's last unbeaten team.</p>
      <p>Spanish guard Ricky Rubio added 21 points and 10 assists for the Suns while Phoenix poured in 23 points off 20 Philadelphia turnovers.</p>

      <p>Booker, who turned 23 last week, became the eighth-youngest player in NBA history to crack the 6,000 career points mark. The fifth-season guard was greeted by chants of "M-V-P" for Most Valuable Player as he walked off the court.</p>
      <p>The Suns, who haven't made the playoffs since 2010, improved to 5-2 while the 76ers slid to 5-1. It took Phoenix 29 games last season to reach a fifth victory.</p>
      <p>"You can play with anybody in the freaking league," Suns coach Monty Williams told his team after the game. "Great job guys."</p>
      <p>Al Horford led the 76ers with 32 points while Tobias Harris added 24 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Sixers played without Cameroon star big man Joel Embiid, who was serving the second game of a two-game ban after a brawl with Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns, also suspended for two games.</p>
      <p>Greek star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 34 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to power Milwaukee over host Minnesota 134-106 after a 49-minute delay at the start to fix a faulty basket.</p>
      <p>Khris Middleton added 26 points and Eric Bledsoe 22 for the Bucks (5-2) while Andrew Wiggins led Minnesota (4-2) for 25 points.</p>
      <p>Houston's James Harden and Brooklyn's Kyrie Irving had big nights in wins.</p>
      <p>One night after an embarrassing 29-point loss at Miami, the Houston Rockets bounced back to beat host Memphis 107-100 behind NBA scoring leader Harden's 44 points on 12-of-28 shooting and 10 rebounds in a game where Russell Westbrook was benched for a rest.</p>
      <p>It was Harden's 80th career game with 40 or more points.</p>
      <p>Irving scored 39 points on 13-of-21 shooting and added nine assists to lead the Brooklyn Nets over visiting New Orleans 135-125.</p>
      <p>"This is my playground out here," Irving said. "I just love to be playing basketball and playing aggressive."</p>
      <p>A 14-6 run to end the game lifted the Nets over the Pelicans, who were led by Brandon Ingram's career-high 40 points on 17-of-24 shooting.</p>
      <p>Caris LeVert added 23 points, Joe Harris scored 19 and Jarrett Allen had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who improved to 3-4 ahead of a five-game road trip.</p>
      <p>"It was very important," Irving said of the win. "Especially the way we've been playing. We've got to continue to get better. Just be patient, we'll get there."</p>
      <p>
        <b>HURTING WARRIORS WIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rookie forward Eric Paschall scored 36 points and grabbed 13 rebounds on his 23rd birthday to lead injury-hit Golden State over Portland 127-118 for the Warriors' first win at their new US$1 billion home arena in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>"Great birthday gift," Paschall said. "We did a hell of a job with the group of guys we have. We didn't back down. This is special. We did a great job."</p>
      <p>The Warriors are without Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and D'Angelo Russell - all major players in their fifth consecutive Western Conference title run last season.</p>
      <p>Bradley Beal scored a team-high 22 points and Japan's Rui Hachimura contributed 12 points, four rebounds, three assists and a steal as the Washington Wizards beat visiting Detroit 115-99.</p>
      <p>Troy Brown and Thomas Bryant each added 14 points for the Wizards while Luke Kennard led Detroit with 24 and Pistons center Andre Drummond grabbed 24 rebounds.</p>
