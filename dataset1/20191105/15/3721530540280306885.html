      <h1>The best movies of the decade, according to us</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:51:29+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Polygon Staff</a></address>
      <p>In the final weeks of 2019, a passing comment provoked the quintessential movie debate of the decade. Asked about his opinion on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/5/18526278/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-movies-avengers-infinity-saga-ranked-list">Marvel movies</a> during a press tour for his Netflix Original Movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/27/20887645/the-irishman-review-netflix-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci"><i>The Irishman</i></a>, legendary director Martin Scorsese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema">said</a>, “That’s not cinema. [...] Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.”</p>
      <p>Rebuttals, defenses, screeds, and decrees erupted from every corner of the internet. Scorsese had to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html">weigh in</a> again. What did “cinema” <i>mean </i>in the modern era? The general upheaval of Hollywood left the argument without an answer.</p>
      <p>Over the past 10 years, studio tentpoles became <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/11/18135153/aquaman-review-dc-jason-momoa-james-wan">more visually complex</a>, yet undeniably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18535563/disney-new-star-wars-movie-avatar-mcu-phase-4-release-dates-schedule">more corporate</a>. Streaming services <a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming">disrupted</a> the theatrical viewing experiences, reinvented the types of movies that “worked” for mass audiences, and made catching up on the classics more difficult than ever. Indie labels either struggled to find footing or came into their own as boutique operations, depending on who you ask. <i>Moonlight</i>, <i>Green Book</i>, and a movie about a sexy fishman won <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18230088/green-book-best-picture-oscars-2019-winner-mahershala-ali">Best Picture Oscars</a>. YouTube stars made straight-to-VOD comedies. <i>Twin Peaks: The Return </i>was actually maybe a really long movie? Hollywood delivered something for everyone in the 2010s, but How We Watch, What We Watch, and Why We Watch became blurrier than ever.</p>
      <p>Everyone is right about “cinema,” and everyone is wrong. There’s room to fear the conglomerates that construct cultural monoliths while also enjoying Marvel movies. There’s reason to trust critical voices who champion art and for moviegoers to form their own opinions after engaging with the finished product. It’s fair to trek an hour to see <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/25/8929081/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-quentin-tarantino"><i>Once Upon a Time in ... Hollywood</i></a> in 70mm, or watch it on a plane when you have time. We’re all watching different shit in different ways. Building beliefs off our favorites — the <i>best movies</i>, by personal definition — shouldn’t be synonymous with drawing lines in the sand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/11/4/20944573/best-games-2019-2010-ps4-switch-xbox-pc-50-11">Our games of the decade list</a> compiled the passions of our entire staff into one mega list worthy of Polygon’s origins. As we prepare to expand and deepen our coverage of movies in the next decade, it made sense to highlight our staff members’ personal picks in a deluge of recommendations. There are commonalities (we, uh, really liked <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i></a>) and surprises (yes, <i>Mamma Mia 2</i> is wonderful, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/24/17602908/mamma-mia-2-here-we-go-again-cinematic-universe">yes, we want a third one</a>). We are an eclectic bunch, and we think Scorsese and Marvel fans will approve.</p>
      <p>Without further ado, these are the best movies of the decade, according to us. And in the spirit of the list, leave your own top 10 in the comments. <i>—Matt Patches, senior entertainment editor</i></p>

          <b>The Social Network</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><i>The Social Network</i>, by chance or by design, has become one of the most immensely relevant movies of this decade. Full of snappy Sorkin conversations, gorgeous Fincher direction, and the decade’s first immensely catchy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross soundtrack, it’s still as engaging as ever. But after nearly a decade of watching Facebook “move fast and break things,” including news websites, social video, politics, etc., the movie’s tangible sense of tension can easily be reinterpreted as foreboding for what comes <i>after</i> you make a billion friends.</p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Arrival</i> is not only my top film of the past decade, it’s one of my top five films of all time. The gorgeous design and cinematography never overpower the emotional twists of the story or the understated acting of Amy Adams. Director Denis Villeneuve created a sublimely crafted film about the nature of love, regret, and humanity, and the most “alien” aliens ever conceived in the history of cinema.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I’m a historical-fiction fanatic, so my list leans heavily into the past. I’ve picked <i>The Death of Stalin</i> as my favorite because nothing made me laugh so much these past 10 years. Armando Iannucci’s satirical portrayal of thoroughly evil men gets to the heart of human awfulness, with its gruesome collection of power-hungry sycophants and psychopaths.</p>

          <b>The Big Sick</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t expect many to understand why I chose <i>The Big Sick</i> as my top movie. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon’s autobiographical romantic comedy may not have been the most groundbreaking film of the past 10 years, but it was a film that defined my own decade. A few years ago, I had my own big sick — one that put me in the hospital for a week and extended into a monthslong recovery period.</p>
      <p>I saw the film in theaters during my recovery, and I think it was necessary in processing my own experience. <i>The Big Sick</i> let me see the scenario from different angles: my mom’s, as she slept on a cot in my hospital room, and my fiancé’s (now my husband), after he had proposed to me just a few days prior. It’s been years, and I’m still processing what happened, but I think it was important for me to see <i>The Big Sick</i> when I did, to help ease these feelings along.</p>

      <p>I guess I really like Edgar Wright.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most authentically adapted comic book movie ever made, <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> captures the bright, original spirit of the source material and pairs it with true casting perfection. It’s almost 10 years old now, and it still maintains a look and style all its own.</p>

          <b>Mad Max: Fury Road</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>I saw <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> in a massive movie theater in Berlin. The dialogue was dubbed, there weren’t subtitles, and I couldn’t understand a single word. It was the most incredible experience I’ve ever had in a movie theater.</p>
      <p>Watching <i>Fury Road</i> in a language I didn’t understand was like being transported to some future version of Mars. Everything in the movie was alien. Movies don’t look like that; they don’t sound like that; they don’t have doof warriors with flaming guitars like that. It wasn’t a movie from Earth. There’s no way a movie that’s essentially just two separate, hourlong action sequences should work. In fact, there’s no reason anyone should have even tried it. Watching it felt like getting the privilege of seeing a masterpiece from one of the Martians’ greatest directors.</p>
      <p>Seeing it in theaters again earlier this year felt exactly the same way. Four years later, there’s still nothing on Earth that looks, or sounds, or feels like <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. If you told me George Miller went to Mars to make it, it would make more sense than <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-making-of-mad-max-fury-road-we-shot-one-scene-fo-1704025550">the real story</a>.</p>

      <p>When word went around that Hollywood had optioned Michael Lewis’ 2003 book about baseball analytics, nonplussed sports fans wondered what in the hell <i>Capote </i>director Bennett Miller (along with screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin) saw in a story about spreadsheets and percentages. But like the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, Miller did a masterful job with an undervalued property and found all of the feel-good moments that a sports flick demands. The emotional crescendo — the redeemed Scott Hatteberg hitting the home run to cap the Athletics’ record 20-game winning streak — is as lump-in-the-throat as anything in <i>The Natural, Hoosiers</i>, or <i>Rudy. </i>And as our readers are well aware, Activision boss Bobby Kotick played an uncredited but very important role, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/in-moneyball-activisions-bobby-kotick-plays-a-familiar-5844105">did an outstanding job</a> with it, too.</p>

          <b>Restrepo</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>This last decade, I became a father of two amazing little girls, and my theatergoing hours have been somewhat limited. Apologies for the bevy of Disney films in my top 10, but I hope you can understand that my antenna’s a little bent at the moment.</p>
      <p>That being said, I also really enjoy a good war movie. In my opinion, it’s not really been a great decade for those. <i>American Sniper</i> utterly broke my heart, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/22/7874305/american-sniper-review">and not in a good way</a>. <i>Lone Survivor </i>was somehow worse than the book it was based on. <i>Fury</i> had great combat sequences, and managed to make Shia LaBeouf look good, but the narrative was as heavy-handed as they come. <i>Dunkirk </i>was very good, but borderline impenetrable. I had to watch it three times to convince myself it was worth watching once.</p>
      <p>But <i>Restrepo</i> ... I’m not sure there’s a more accurate depiction of modern warfare out there. It’s a tremendous documentary from a technical standpoint, but emotionally, it’s a lot to deal with. Sitting through that film will change the way you view American politics forever, or at least it should.</p>

          <b>Parasite</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Parasite</i> feels like a natural culmination of the themes that have always been present in director Bong Joon-ho’s work and in the last decade of cinema on the whole. The idea that we are reckoning with more than just everyday human evil — that we are trapped in the cage of late-stage capitalism (and that we may be hurtling inexorably toward our own destruction, hello <i>First Reformed</i>) — manifests here in a story in which everyone is culpable in some way. In order for one person to get to the top of the wheel, someone else must be cast to the bottom.</p>
      <p>The way in which the cycle plays out in <i>Parasite</i> is both horrific and hilarious, as Bong masterfully ramps up tension, then sends it all unspooling in a roller-coaster ride that defies all expectations. The film is a triumph that immediately establishes itself as one of the best of the decade, as well as cementing Bong’s place as one of the best filmmakers of all time.</p>

          <b>Eighth Grade</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Through the last several years of nostalgia trips — <i>Stranger Things</i>! SNES Classic! Lisa Frank hotel! — nothing transported me back to adolescence quite like <i>Eighth Grade</i>. Though it stars a Gen Z-er, the immensely lovable Elsie Fisher, the movie manages to feel universal. Everyone watching has been a 13-year-old; most of us hated that experience.</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Bo Burnham (incidentally, one of my middle-school crushes), <i>Eighth Grade</i> captures that specific feeling of being 13, when everything is embarrassing and The Biggest Deal. We’re pulled into protagonist Kayla’s world through a combination of Burnham’s directing choices, like focusing the camera on a classmate’s stony face while her mom extends a party invitation, and Fisher’s devastating, earnest performance. We know that most of Kayla’s problems are trivial, and still we want to tell her to be nicer to her dad, protect her from mean girls and boys who’ll take advantage of her, and buy her some acne stickers. Not because we know better, but because we know exactly how it feels.</p>
      <p><i>Eighth Grade</i> is a masterpiece of empathy that will hopefully join the canon of essential coming-of-age stories.</p>

      </p>
      <p><i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> would have been my top pick just for the sheer joy that comes through in the movie’s design, but its story within a story within a story pushes it over the line from “great” to “sublime.” Everyone has a story, but movies rarely dig into what happens after that adventure. <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> shows that sometimes our relations are tragically cut short, the world moves on without us, and what once seemed destined to last forever quickly becomes temporary. The only constant is change, and Wes Anderson is more willing than most to find the weary dignity in refusing to catch up.</p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Interstellar</i> is one of those rare science-fiction films whose arresting visual effects and artistic direction are, above all else, an instrument used to tell a much deeper, more personal human story. Christopher Nolan’s movie capitalizes on — and ultimately, satisfies — our curiosity for the great unknown, but never once deviates from its thoughtful ruminations on humanity, survival, and our willingness to sacrifice everything for those we love.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Jonathan Glazer’s existential sci-fi horror film, about an alien who harvests men for purposes that are opaque, is painful and intense. We get little visibility into the motivations of Scarlett Johansson’s extraterrestrial predator of flesh, other than that she coldly exploits men’s sexuality and (cruelly) human love to seemingly serve unfeeling masters of her own. From the alien creature’s birth to its awakening to its savage demise, <i>Under the Skin</i> is a grim short story with chilling implications. (Oh, and shout-out to Micah Levi’s piercing, icy score.)</p>

          <b>The Comedy</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>In 2012, I saw <i>The Comedy</i> torpedo a particular breed of hipster behavior running amok in cities across America. In 2019, writer-director Rick Alverson’s character study is even uglier, predicting how a strain of ironic internet humor would insulate privilege and ravage the authentic life.</p>
      <p>After years of experimenting with strange cadences and comedic quirks on shows like <i>Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!</i>, Tim Heidecker goes “full Joker” as Swanson, a slovenly, boat-shoe-wearing buffoon who can’t resist a goof. That makes him the life of a house party, and a radicalized IRL shitposter; a cab driver, his co-workers, a group of for-hire gardeners, the black patrons of a Harlem bar, and his own dying father become victims of his relentless gags. He can’t stop. He’s white, he’s rich, and no one can touch him. He feels nothing. And since 2012, there are only more Swansons in the world.</p>
      <p><i>The Comedy</i> is not a feel-good time at the movies, but it’s a decade-defining portrait that never flinches. Heidecker delivers a De Niro-level performance as he skewers the type of person who’s probably a fan of his Adult Swim work. Alverson’s brutalist direction ensures the audience always catches themselves laughing at Swanson’s man-child antics. When a track from William Basinski’s 9/11-themed <i>Disintegration Loops</i> plays over a montage of Swanson playing wiffle ball and riding bikes with friends, the point is clear: a lack of awareness is the quickest route to cultural decay.</p>

      </p>
      <p>While I’m confident <i>World of Tomorrow</i> is my favorite film of the decade, I’m also confident that <i>The Wind Rises</i> will take its place in a few minutes, and <i>Spider-Verse</i> will usurp the throne a few minutes after that. I’ve been shuffling the position of my top three for an hour, because it’s been that astonishing of a decade for animation. Anywho, rather than waste more of my time (and yours) reorganizing a list, let me focus on Don Hertzfeldt’s two-part masterpiece about the danger of wasting our limited time on meaningless trivialities.</p>
      <p>Even though the first episode is only 17 minutes long, there’s no concise way to summarize what happens. A young girl named Emily learns about the future from a third-generation clone of herself. But really, this is a film about life and death — the weird, desperate, and often misguided ways we try to make the most of the former, and the tragic and inevitably doomed methods we devise to escape the latter. The crushing existential clarity of the film is mercifully balanced by Hertzfeldt’s modest stick-figure drawings and a sense of humor he honed with pre-YouTube web hits. Yes, the movie that most affected me this decade was made by the creator of “My Spoon Is Too Big” and “My Anus Is Bleeding.” In a decade in which reality felt absurd, it’s fitting that Hertzfeldt would be the best person to make sense of it.</p>

      <p>When I think about the time I saw <i>Fury Road</i> in theaters, I think about the professor who taught my Film 101 course. The subject of her dissertation was films that sought to cause “visceral” reactions in their audiences — which mean that a lot of her curriculum was in the horror genre. As a notorious wimp, I did not enjoy this very much.</p>
      <p>Walking out of <i>Fury Road</i>, I felt like I finally understood horror fans. It was the longest I have ever felt tension at a movie without becoming uncomfortable: two straight hours of being emotionally edged by some of the most expert filmmaking, sleek writing, and cohesive world-building ever seen in a one-and-done cinematic story.</p>
      <p>Blinking in the springtime light of a bustling Manhattan sidewalk, I wanted to punch a car in the face. In a good way.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Horror films have tackled dread in so many different ways, but nothing has ever hit home as hard as <i>Get Out</i>. While the fear of being chased by a killer or haunted by a ghost has worked for decades, the social fear of being the only person of color in a world that is the exact opposite of yours was harrowing to see on screen. It’s difficult to explain to anyone who has never been in those shoes, and while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/20/18274280/get-out-themes-jordan-peele-black-film"><i>Get Out</i> explores the topic with a somewhat fantastical approach</a>, the fear that bubbles below the surface of even the most casual encounters is almost as disturbing as the film’s roller-coaster tail end.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Am I gaming this process somewhat by picking <i>The Social Network</i> as my top film of the 2010s? Yes. I’m not sure it’s my <i>favorite</i> movie from this decade per se, but I slotted it there partly because I figured others might choose another one of the entries in my top 10, and partly because of the overall recency bias in my personal list.</p>
      <p>But I don’t have any reservations about putting it in the No. 1 spot, either. It’s not a stretch to say that the 2010s was the decade of Facebook, and that would make <i>The Social Network</i> the most prescient film of the past 10 years. The performances are terrific, particularly Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Mark Zuckerberg not as the robotic goober we would come to know from interviews and congressional hearings — a programming savant, not a policy wonk — but as a ruthless businessman with an ego that grows as quickly as his company’s user base. The screenplay is the smartest and best thing Aaron Sorkin has written since the first two seasons of <i>The West Wing</i>, and in the hands of director David Fincher, this tech/business story becomes a riveting tale of personal animus run amok. If the past 10 years have taught us anything — from Facebook to GamerGate to our current president — it’s that hell hath no fury like a white man scorned, and <i>The Social Network</i> captured that all the way back in 2010.</p>

      <p>The Mad Max series has always banged, but <i>Fury Road</i> is the pinnacle of that bang, part heart-pounding action and part meditation on patriarchal oppression. And it’s not just talk; George Miller brought in Eve Ensler, author of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>, as a consultant to make sure the messaging was on point. The result is the most perfect action movie that has ever existed, and the best movie of the decade.</p>

      <p>If Infinity War were a video game, its difficulty would have been New Game+++++++++++++++++++++++, and yet directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely delivered an impossibly astounding, emotionally draining, deeply satisfying, modern-day tragedy.</p>
