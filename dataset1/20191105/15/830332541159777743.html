      <p>(CNN) - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has disqualified Nigeria's "Lionheart" as the nation's contender for the Oscar in the Best International Feature Film category.</p>
      <p>The film, directed by and starring award-winning Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji, was initially one of 92 films <a href="https://ew.com/oscars/2019/09/30/oscars-2020-best-international-feature-submissions-by-country/">submitted</a> in the category. But the film was withdrawn Monday after the Academy ruled that it didn't meet the requirements for the award.</p>
      <p>Films in the category must be produced outside the United States with a predominantly non-English dialogue track, according to the Academy's <a href="http://cepublic.oscars.org/uploads/D24AECE69BABF119B6F52FF59AA34D30/resources/92_IFFA_Rules_FINAL.pdf">rules</a>.</p>
      <p>Most of "Lionheart" is in English with just under 12 minutes of dialogue in the Igbo language, primarily spoken in eastern Nigeria, making it ineligible.</p>
      <p>"Lionheart," Nigeria's first Netflix original film, is about a Nigerian woman named Adaeze, portrayed by Nnaji, trying to keep her family's transportation business together.</p>
      <p>Nnaji expressed her disappointment on Twitter over the Academy's decision.</p>
      <p>According to the actress, the film represents how Nigerians communicate and the country should be able to compete for an Oscar in its official language â€” English.</p>
      <p>"This movie represents the way we speak as Nigerians. This includes English which acts as a bridge between the 500+ languages spoken in our country; thereby making us #OneNigeria," she wrote.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the news, the Nigeria Oscar Selection Committee (NOSC) in a statement said it will only submit films with non-English dialogue in the future for consideration by the academy.</p>
      <p>"Lionheart passed on other technical requirements from the story, to sound and picture except for language as adjudged by the Academy screening matrix, which was a challenge for the committee at a time. This is an eye-opener and steps forward into growing a better industry," said NOSC chairman Chineze Anyaene in the statement.</p>
      <p>The 12-member committee was put together to select Nigeria's entry in the Best International Feature Film category at the 92nd Academy Awards set for February 9, 2020.</p>
      <p>Award-winning filmmaker Ava DurVernay joined others on social media to express their disappointment in the film's disqualification.</p>
      <p>"Are you barring this country from ever competing for an Oscar in its official language?" DurVernay wrote.</p>
