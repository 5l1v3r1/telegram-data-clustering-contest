      <p>MUMBAI: Indian farmers and businesses Tuesday (Nov 5) hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/india-will-not-join-rcep-trade-deal-12062880">opt out of a sprawling Asian trade pact</a>, with the country's largest dairy producer Amul thanking the premier for "supporting livelihoods".</p>
      <p>New Delhi's 11th-hour rejection of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - which was meant to account for 30 percent of global GDP and loop in half the world's population - comes as India battles slowing manufacturing and consumption.</p>

      <p>The pact would have increased India's access to other Asian markets, but New Delhi feared its domestic industries would be hit hard if the country was flooded with cheap Made-in-China goods, particularly in key employment sectors such as agriculture and textiles.</p>
      <p>In a tweet late Monday, Amul applauded Modi's "exemplary leadership and support" to dairy farmers, who would have been exposed to more competition under the RCEP.</p>
      <p>"Your vision of supporting their livelihood will help doubling their incomes and make India stronger," it said.</p>
      <p>Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the leading lobby group, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), released a statement to AFP warning the deal would have allowed Chinese manufacturers to overwhelm "the Indian market with Made In China products at very low prices ... thereby creating a disequilibrium".</p>

      <p>B M Singh, convenor of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said the rejection of the deal was "a huge victory for farmers".</p>
      <p>"We should not go for an open agreement like the RCEP simply because we can't compete with other big countries," Singh told AFP.</p>
      <p>"It's like throwing someone who is 25kg into a boxing ring and asking him to compete with an opponent weighing 100kg."</p>
      <p>
        <b>REELING ECONOMY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some small business owners welcomed the move but said it would not be enough to sustain their industries or make them competitive.</p>
      <p>Shaikh Mobinuddin, a plastics manufacturer in Mumbai's massive Dharavi slum, said the cost of setting up a business in India remained prohibitive while the process was excessively bureaucratic.</p>
      <p>"Currently, the situation is pretty bad with policy paralysis, lack of infrastructure and capital available for businesses. We are not able to grow most of these small-scale businesses," he told AFP.</p>

      <p>Experts were divided on Modi's decision, with some warning that New Delhi, which has a long history of protectionism, may lose out as it tries to become a more globally competitive economy.</p>
      <p>"In an era in which manufacturing requires the ability to become more - not less - integrated into global supply chains, this decision appears for the moment to make it harder to boost manufacturing in India," Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Alyssa Ayres wrote.</p>
      <p>"The central issue for the Indian government isn't in the wording of a trade deal, but in the competitiveness of the Indian economy," Ayres added in a blog post underlining the need for further reforms to kickstart growth.</p>
      <p>Others cautioned that India was not ready to cope with the influx of cheaper products amid the downturn.</p>
      <p>"India's economy is currently reeling under some stress and it wouldn't have been the right time to take a decision which possibly could have had a large impact on various sectors of the economy," Drip Capital co-founder Pushkar Mukewar said.</p>
      <p>India's pullout is nevertheless seen as a blow to the deal, which now includes all 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - but not the United States.</p>
      <p>The remaining members are aiming to sign it next year after reviewing an agreed draft text.</p>
