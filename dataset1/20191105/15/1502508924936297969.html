      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">Markets </a>watchdog <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>has issued consolidated operational guidelines for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-portfolio-investors">foreign portfolio investors </a>and designated depository participants to facilitate implementation of the new <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-fpi">FPI </a>regulations.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Regulations came into force from September 23.</p>
      <p>Under the new norms, all insurance entities and funds from FATF member countries have been classified as category-I FPIs.</p>
      <p>Among others, unregulated funds or entity where the regulated investment manager is from non-FATF member country would be under category-II.</p>
      <p>To ensure transition of existing FPIs, re-categorisation of registration would be done by NSDL in consultation with the respective designated depository participants (DDPs).</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-fpi">FPI </a>can seek recategorisation from category-II to I after providing requisite information and applicable fees to the DDP.</p>
      <p>"These consolidated operational guidelines for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-portfolio-investors">foreign portfolio investors </a>and designated depository participants are issued to facilitate implementation of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>(Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>said.</p>
      <p>In case, the aggregate investment limit is breached, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-fpi">FPI </a>concerned has to sell the excess holdings only to domestic investors, as per the guidelines.</p>
      <p>Once the holding crosses the limit, the depositories have to inform stock exchanges about the breach.</p>
      <p>"In the event of a breach of the sectoral cap/aggregate FPI limit/aggregate NRI limit, the foreign investors shall divest their excess holding within 5 trading days from the date of settlement of the trades, by selling shares only to domestic investors," the regulator said.</p>
