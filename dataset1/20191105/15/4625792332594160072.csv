Florida commission denies library's request for New York Times subscription citing 'fake news'
05 Nov 2019, 15:32 by Mike Brest
A Florida county commission unanimously denied a library's request for additional funding in order to pay for a subscription to the New York Times.
The Citrus County committee denied the request for $2,700 annually at a hearing last month. The hearing occurred the same day the Trump administration announced plans to end federal agencies' subscriptions to the Times and Washington Post.
One of the five commissioners who voted against providing the funding, Scott Carnahan, called the Times ""fake news,"" and added that he agrees with President Trump and said, ""I will not be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in this county,"" according to the Post.
Ron Kitchen Jr., a different commissioner, asked, “Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?” Another commissioner, Jimmy Smith, wondered, ""Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?""
The library was not pleased with the commissioner's decision.
“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library’s advisory board, told the Citrus County Chronicle. “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented.”
One of the other commissioners later expressed regret, saying, ""Our decision should have been impartial.""
