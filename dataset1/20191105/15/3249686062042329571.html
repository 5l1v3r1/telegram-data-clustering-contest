The judge stated, <i>"A big portion of the criminal charges have been explained, which shows this is an important issue. When I consider Ahn Joon Young's role in this case and the police investigation until now, I deem that imprisonment is both necessary and reasonable." </i>These pretrial detention warrants against Ahn Joon Young and Kim Yong Bum will ensure both suspects do not attempt to destroy evidence or flee the country.<br/><br/>The arrest warrants for the others called in for questioning have been dismissed as they've acknowledged their crimes or police have gathered sufficient evidence for their crimes, and their imprisonment would not be required for the investigation.<br/><br/>In other news, Ahn Joon Young is <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/video/2019/11/produce-x-101-producer-ahn-joon-young-suspected-of-receiving-entertainment-at-adult-business-as-bribery">suspected</a> of receiving entertainment at adult businesses from an agency involved in 'Produce x 101'.</p>
