      <p>London - Australia's One Day International captain <b>Aaron Finch</b> is to be skipper of <b>The Northern Superchargers </b>for the inaugural edition of <b>The Hundred</b>, the franchise announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old batsman - who is also skipper of the T20 Australian side - had been Superchargers coach Darren Lehmann's first pick in the draft.</p>
      <p>They know each other well from Lehmann's stint as head coach of Australia - the pinnacle winning the 2015 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Finch - who has over 100 ODI's and 50 T20 international appearances to his credit - has played for seven IPL sides as well as the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash.</p>
      <p>He also has valuable English county experience through stints at both Surrey and Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>He will captain a side which includes England superstar all-rounder Ben Stokes.</p>
      <p>"I've spent many years working alongside Darren and I'm really excited to be heading back to Headingley (Yorkshire's home ground) as captain of the Northern Superchargers," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"I think we have an excellent side with a good mixture of quality English cricketers and some match-winning overseas stars and I'm very confident of our chances when The Hundred kicks off next summer."</p>
      <p>Lehmann, who had a successful stint playing for Yorkshire and was an integral part of the side that ended a 33-year drought in landing the county championship in 2001, said he was licking his lips with anticipation at the potential of the team.</p>
      <p>"I think we've picked a great team and I'm really excited to see what Aaron and I can do with the group," said Lehmann.</p>
      <p>"He is a world class cricketer and a superb leader.</p>
      <p>"We want to start The Hundred with a bang and get even more people watching this innovative new short-form of cricket."</p>
