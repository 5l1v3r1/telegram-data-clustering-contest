Andreas Seidl: McLaren working hard to improve pit-stops
05 Nov 2019, 15:20 by Bobby Vincent

McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has admitted the Woking-based squad are working hard to try and improve the efficiency and reliability of their pit-stops in Formula 1.

At the Mexican Grand Prix two weekends ago, Lando Norris came in for a pit-stop and the mechanics left one of the tyres slightly loose, meaning Norris had to reverse back into position so the tyre could be fitted properly.
This cost Norris a huge amount of time and ended his chance of finishing in the points and he retired not too long after as there was no real advantage of continuing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.
""Pit-stops are definitely an area in the team where we still have to improve quite a lot,"" Seidl said, as quoted by Crash.net. ""We have to help the race team out here, the mechanics especially, by let's say updating our car hardware and equipment in the future simply to allow them to do better and reliable pit-stops.

""That's a project we're working very hard on. Unfortunately, it takes time. It's part of the process we're in at the moment to become a better team. The difference to the top three teams is not just car performance but also how they pull it off weekend by weekend, the consistency they are having in their results, and that's something we're working on very hard.""
