      <p>A senior Twitter executive has suggested a number of new features that could appear on the social network in 2020, including the ability to block being mentioned without permission.</p>
      <p>The company’s vice president of design and research tweeted several ideas, although it is not clear whether they will become a reality next year.</p>
      <p>Dantley Davis’s account teased that users could have the power to remove themselves from a conversation, as well as the means to disallow retweeting of certain posts if they do not want them being distributed by other people.</p>
      <p>He opened a series of tweets, saying: “Features that I’m looking forward to in 2020,” listing removal of a specific mention from a conversation and tweeting only to a specific hashtag, interest or group of friends as potential options.</p>
      <p>“Do you agree with the ideas in this list? What else would you add? #designtwitter,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>“I believe giving more control to users will help create a healthier Twitter and reduce abuse. Additionally, these features need to be easy to access and use.”</p>
      <p>Mr Davis also suggested that threads should be automatically labelled on the social network, meaning users no longer have to make it obvious themselves.</p>
      <p>An edit button allowing users to correct mistakes has been a long-requested feature, which the Twitter executive touched on in response to a comment.</p>
      <p>“This can be done with integrity,” he responded.</p>
      <p>Twitter recently made headlines by announcing that it was banning political advertising from its service, a decision which has put pressure on Facebook to follow suit.</p>
