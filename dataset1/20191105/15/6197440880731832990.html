      <h1>Google extends the life of over 100 Chromebooks w/ extra year of software support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:51:04+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Every Chromebook that’s ever hit the market has an “end-of-life” date built in, meaning that once that date has been hit, updates will no longer hit the machine. It’s a definite downside, but Google has just extended an olive branch to nearly every Chromebook by offering another year of software support.</p>
      <p>There’s a <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en">support page from Google that lists</a> out the EOL dates for every single Chromebook, and for quite a few, those dates were coming up relatively quickly. Earlier this year, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/26/lenovo-chromebooks-updates-expanded/">Google gave several of Lenovo’s Chromebooks</a> including the popular C330 some extra time and that’s been extended to many other models.</p>
      <p>This week, Google updated that support page to revise the EOL dates of a whopping 135 different Chromebooks from various manufacturers. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/04/google-gives-most-chromebooks-an-extra-year-of-software-support/"><i>Android Police</i></a> has a great side-by-side comparison of how each Chromebook’s date was changed, but almost every model was given an extension of almost exactly a year. Some, though, only added a few months while a couple added up to two years.</p>
      <p>Notably, this includes some of Google’s own Chromebook models, too. The 2015 Chromebook Pixel will now get updates through June 2021, while the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/06/20/google-tablet-abandoned-development/">short-lived Pixel Slate</a> will get another two years of support through June 2026. We’re betting that one probably has something to do with the Pixelbook Go and its nearly identical internals.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear <i>why</i> Google has suddenly decided to start giving all these Chromebooks a new lease on life with extended software support, but it’s certainly not something to complain about. Hopefully, Google will eventually just give these machines better support indefinitely.</p>
