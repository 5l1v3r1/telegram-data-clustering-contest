      <h1>Oil market outlook may have upside potential in 2020: OPEC chief</h1>
      <h2>OPEC's Mohammad Barkindo said he was more optimistic about the market outlook for next year than he had been in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:23:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-market">oil market </a>outlook for next year may have upside potential, the secretary-general of producer group OPEC said on Tuesday, appearing to downplay any need to cut output more deeply.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia meet in December. The so-called OPEC+ alliance, seeking to boost oil prices, has since January implemented a deal to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day until March 2020.</p>
      <p>OPEC's Mohammad Barkindo said he was more optimistic about the market outlook for next year than he had been in October, when he had said all options were open including a deeper cut to oil output amid forecasts of oversupply.</p>
      <p>"Based on the preliminary numbers, 2020 looks like it will have upside potential," he told a briefing on Tuesday. "There are definitely brighter spots. The numbers are looking more refined and the picture is looking brighter."</p>
      <p>"The other non-fundamental factors like trade issues that have been impacting negatively on the global economy, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/economy-policy-news-1020101.htm">news </a>coming out is more optimistic. We have seen the biggest economy in the world, the United States, continuing to defy projections, racing ahead."</p>
      <p>OPEC's figures suggest there will be excess supply next year due to rising production outside the group.</p>
      <p>This prospect and issues such as the U. S.-China trade dispute have weighed on oil prices , which at around $62.70 a barrel are down from a 2019 high above $75.</p>
      <p>On whether the market looked oversupplied for next year, Barkindo said: "We are not there yet. We will not be able to at this point pre-empt all the steps that we are working through."</p>
      <p>Those steps, he said, include upcoming meetings of OPEC technical committees, such as its Economic Commission Board, and the next OPEC monthly <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/oil-market">oil market </a>report, which looks at global demand and supply, due on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Barkindo also said Brazil would be welcome to join the 14-country oil producer group but had not yet made an official request to do so.</p>
      <p>"They would be most welcome to join," he told reporters, adding that consultations had taken place in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said last month that he wants his country to join OPEC, a move that would add the most significant new producer to the oil cartel for years but met with scepticism in Brazil's energy industry.</p>
      <p>OPEC on Tuesday released its 2019 World Oil Outlook, in which the producer group said it would supply a diminishing amount of oil in the next five years as output of U. S. shale and other rival sources expanded.</p>
