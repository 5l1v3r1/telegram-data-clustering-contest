香港要變天？林鄭6號進京見韓正。兇徒刀刺、咬掉趙家賢耳朵，香港恐怖週日一次看懂！ 紅二代揭當局對反送中「超限戰」，葉劉淑儀促下月平亂 | 新聞拍案驚奇 大宇

大家好，歡迎收看《新聞拍案驚奇》，我是大宇。 週日下午1點，香港人發起「反警暴 七區緊急行街」活動，地點包括金鐘、旺角、黃大仙、大埔、荃灣、沙田和屯門。所謂行街，不同於遊行，我理解類似於眾人自發聚集的“塞爆行動”。港人在除了這七區之外的地方，也舉辦了活動。活動過程中，大埔超級城的吉野家、屯門時代廣場的美心西餅等店面遭到部分示威者的衝擊。警察也出現在多處示威地點，最終演變成一場激烈的衝突，還在太古發生大陸男子持刀襲擊和咬掉耳朵事件，現場相當血腥。四中全會後，當局沒有出台有利措施緩解香港局勢，而從政策表述、警察武力等方面，似乎朝著示威者訴求相反的方向發展。在這個時間點，有建制派議員提出，希望當局12月中旬平息這場風波，然而在這樣的情況下，怎麼去平息呢？

Hello everyone, welcome to the ""News Surprise"", I am Daewoo. At 1 pm on Sunday, Hong Kong people launched the ""Anti-Police Violence 7 District Emergency Street"" activities at Admiralty, Mong Kok, Wong Tai Sin, Tai Po, Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin and Tuen Mun. The so-called street, unlike the parade, I understand the ""spitfire"" that is similar to the spontaneous gathering of the people. The Hong Kong people also held activities in addition to the seven districts. During the event, the Yoshinoya of Tai Po Super City and the Maxim's Cake of Tuen Mun Times Square were hit by some demonstrators. The police also appeared in various demonstration sites, which eventually turned into a fierce conflict. In the Taikoo, the mainland men attacked and bitten their ears with the knife. The scene was quite bloody. After the Fourth Plenary Session, the authorities did not introduce favorable measures to alleviate the situation in Hong Kong. From the aspects of policy expression and police force, it seems to be developing in the opposite direction of the protesters' demands. At this point in time, some members of the formed system proposed that the authorities should calm down the storm in mid-December. However, under such circumstances, how can we calm down?
