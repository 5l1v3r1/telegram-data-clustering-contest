Lewis Hamilton showed his ""gritty, steely and determined"" side in 2019 F1 season
05 Nov 2019, 15:30 by Bobby Vincent

Lewis Hamilton clinched his sixth Drivers' title on Sunday, his third world championship on the bounce and for former Formula 1 driver Jolyon Palmer, this one is one of the more impressive ones.

Hamilton was leading for a large amount of the race in Texas, trying to master another one-stop strategy, but eventually the fresher tyres of his team-mate Valtteri Bottas paid dividends and the Finnish driver overtook his colleague with just a few laps remaining.
Palmer, in his BBC Formula 1 column, has described Hamilton's sixth championship win as one of the more impressive ones for the British driver as he has shown a side to him we're perhaps not too used to seeing.





""As much as he has dominated some races, Hamilton has also had to fight this season - such as in Austin on Sunday,"" Palmer said. ""Starting fifth on the grid, he tore his way past both Ferraris on the opening lap, into third.

""And by the end of the race, he was just a few laps from winning, despite being on an inferior strategy to Valtteri Bottas and Max Verstappen, by putting in a marathon stint on a set of hard tyres.


""The stats say that Hamilton has won 10 of the 19 races this year, and that goes some way to showing how good he has been. Many of his other victories have come from gritty, steely, determined drives, in more exciting races.""
