      <h1>South Lanarkshire Council leader in Twitter attack on unionists</h1>
      <h2>His Tweet was of a sign saying “ram your union up your hoop” whilst a second featured the union flag amidst dog dirt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:43:41+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Geddes, East Kilbride News, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jonathan-geddes/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/east-kilbride-news/</a></address>
      <p>The leader of South Lanarkshire Council has apologised after comparing Unionist supporters to dog dirt in an inflammatory Tweet.</p>
      <p>John Ross, who has led the local authority since 2017, sparked a storm of protest on social media after his comments on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Those came during a gathering of independence supporters in George Square in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross Tweeted: “The perfect answer to our Unionist friends” before showing two pictures, both featuring signs held aloft by independence supporters.</p>
      <p>The first stated “ram your union up your hoop” while the second featured the union flag amidst dog dirt.</p>
      <p>The council leader deleted the message several hours later after furious comments from Union supporters, before apologising two days later.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user wrote: “You’ve shown your true colours. Apologies at this point are the least of your worries. Shame on you.”</p>
      <p>Another stated: “Absolutely shameful language.”</p>

      <p>A third added: “I’m sorry, but that r-Tweet and your comment was unacceptable. And now this Tweet smacks of insincerity.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Joe Fagan hit out at Mr Ross and his Tweet, criticising the council leader for his online faux-pas.</p>
      <p>He said: “John Ross is perfectly entitled to his opinions about independence, but as Leader of the council he has a responsibility to everyone in South Lanarkshire, whether they voted Yes or No.</p>
      <p>“He needs to remember that before he fires off another one of his Tweets.”</p>
      <p>The News understands that Mr Ross will not be considered in breach of South Lanarkshire Council’s social media policy,however, due to the remarks being made in a personal capacity.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross told us: “My support for independence is well-known and I am proud to be part of the campaign for another independence referendum.</p>
      <p>“It is very clear to me that the UK is presently in a mess and that Scotland would be better off out of the Union, and that was the essence of the messages on the posters that I Tweeted from the rally.</p>
      <p>“However, the wording and images were not the sort of thing I would use myself and when I had a chance to reflect on this, I decided to delete the tweet from my timeline.”</p>
      <p>Saturday’s Tweet was not the first time that the council leader’s use of social media has caused controversy.</p>
      <p>In 2018 he came under fire from opposition politicians after a Tweet called for“civil defiance” to secure Scottish independence.</p>
