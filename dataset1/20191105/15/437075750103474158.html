      <p>For 36-year-old Kathlehong resident Mthunzi Motha, FUNda Sonke has provided a perfect opportunity to connect with people across the country and learn ways to help improve literacy in his community.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nalibali.mobi/">FUNda Sonke</a> – isiXhosa for “everyone read” – is a loyalty programme for everyone in the national reading-for-enjoyment campaign, <a href="https://nalibali.org/">Nal’ibali</a>. The programme acknowledges everyday heroes like Motha who generously volunteer their time to encourage and support reading in their communities. It is also a place for everyone to share their literacy experiences, successes and challenges, and to support one another as well as do the three free online modules that <a href="https://nalibali.org/">Nal’ibali</a> offers.</p>

      <p>Motha started a reading club in June. He had been part of <a href="https://nalibali.org/">Nal’ibali</a> for just over a year and was one of the first people to join FUNda Sonke when it launched in April. An enthusiastic participant in <a href="https://nalibali.mobi/">FUNda Sonke</a>’s many challenges, he has won books and Shoprite vouchers that were up for grabs.</p>
      <p>Being in FUNda Sonke has given me the opportunity to connect with other people who are making a change in their communities through literacy. Being there has also motivated me to start writing children stories.</p>
      <p>“I was listening to the radio when I heard about <a href="https://nalibali.org/">Nal’ibali</a> and I was interested in it because I saw a need for literacy activities in my community,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am unemployed and I thought, what better way to use my time than to help children and see them improve in their studies by forming a reading club?”</p>

      <p>Before <a href="https://nalibali.mobi/">FUNda Sonke</a>, Motha had mentored children in leadership skills as a volunteer at schools in his area and he had also worked as a homework assistant.</p>
      <p>Stories bring imagination to life and allow children to dream.</p>
      <p>“Being in <a href="https://nalibali.mobi/">FUNda Sonke</a> has given me the opportunity to connect with other people who are making a change in their communities through literacy. Being there has also motivated me to start writing children stories,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I hope that one day I am able to share the stories with other children outside my reading club and maybe turn them into a book.”</p>

      <p>Motha reads the stories that he writes in isiZulu to the children in his reading club, which meets twice a week. The club struggles to get books.</p>
      <p>“Stories bring imagination to life and allow children to dream,” said Motha.</p>
