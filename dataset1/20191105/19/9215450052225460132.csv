香港減息谷爆樓市 經濟衰退惡果由誰埋單
05 Nov 2019, 19:30 by 投資
11月8日是「立冬」之日，惟香港經濟已身處寒冬之境。第三季香港本地生產總值（GDP）按年跌2.9%，按季比較，繼第二季跌0.5%後，第三季進一步倒退3.2%，正式宣布香港步入技術性經濟衰退。若要刺激經濟，一般會用上減息，此舉可減輕融資成本，有利推動投資。 美國本週再度減息，是今次減息週期中第三次減息。以香港銀行結餘分析，香港未有需要跟隨美國減息，但出奇意料地滙豐銀行帶頭將最優惠利率（P）由5.125厘減至5厘，其他主要銀行隨即跟減。

香港減息，真的可令香港經濟起死回生嗎？當然，或多或少會舒緩本地企業的經營壓力，但僅僅減息0.125厘作用不大，更何況滙豐已明言息口未有再下調空間，意味不用奢望會進一步減息。 回看中美經濟，前者經濟增長仍保持6%水平，後者亦達2%，夾在中間的香港，理應「衰極有限」。但如今卻出現經濟衰退，歸因反修例風波所致。 香港經濟四大支柱，即金融服務、旅遊、貿易及物流和專業及工商業支援服務，已受到不同程度的衝擊，尤以旅遊業首當其衝。 繼7月及8月訪港旅客分別按年下跌4.8%及39.1%， 9月繼續減少34.2%後，行政長官林鄭月娥再透露10月上半個月的訪港旅客量按年下跌約50%。


第三季香港本地生產總值（GDP）按年跌2.9%，按季比較，繼第二季跌0.5%後，第三季進一步倒退3.2%，正式宣布香港步入技術性經濟衰退。

香港減息 600萬至800萬元單位搶位
至於零售，9月香港零售業銷貨價值僅299億元， 按年下跌18.3%。在反修例風波未得到平息前，展望即將來臨的聖誕新年傳統旺季，生意難寄厚望。 若分析減息對股市影響，主要是企業融資成本有所減少，尤其是一眾重債股、地產股最為得益。 至於銀行股，摩根士丹利發表報告表示，因香港銀行大部份存款比例與儲蓄利率連繫，跟最優惠利率掛鈎的資產比例不多，有助輕微擴闊淨息差。
不過，對於整體港股大市，減息幫助不是全面，後市策略仍以揀股不揀市為重心，今期「封面故事」挑選的20隻強勢股，大家要密切留意。 其實，今次滙豐帶頭減息，最利好的就是樓市。 原本已步入跌浪的香港樓市，林鄭月娥在最新施政報告中一招放寬九成及八成按揭保險的樓價上限，馬上令樓市轉活，尤其是600萬至800萬元的單位，更是搶手。
經濟衰退 樓市快見真章
如今再減息，即使實際作用不大，如借款100萬元計，30年還款期，每月僅少供66元，而且不少業主已採用銀行同業拆息按揭（H按），減P息未有太大影響。 但至少可起心理利好作用，加強對樓市的信心，令樓價有所支持。 又不過，樓價長遠走勢仍要視乎經濟，倘經濟未有起色，樓市消化完這輪購買力後，才見真章。

Hong Kong cut interest rates in the valley of the property market, who will pay for the economic downturn
05 Nov 2019, 19:30 by Investment
November 8 is the day of ""Li Dong"", but the Hong Kong economy is already in a cold winter. In the third quarter, Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 2.9% year-on-year. Comparing quarterly, after falling 0.5% in the second quarter, the third quarter further fell by 3.2%, officially announcing Hong Kong's entry into a technical recession. In order to stimulate the economy, interest rate cuts will generally be used, which will reduce financing costs and promote investment. The US cut interest rates again this week, which is the third rate cut in this interest rate cut cycle. Based on the Hong Kong bank balance analysis, Hong Kong did not need to follow the US interest rate cuts, but unexpectedly HSBC took the lead in reducing the prime rate (P) from 5.125% to 5%, and other major banks followed.

Can interest rate cuts in Hong Kong really bring Hong Kong's economy back to life? Of course, it will more or less ease the pressure on local businesses, but it is not a big deal to cut interest rates by 0.125%. What's more, HSBC has already said that there is no room for further reduction, which means that there is no need to expect further interest rate cuts. Looking back at the Sino-US economy, the former's economic growth is still at 6%, and the latter is also 2%. Hong Kong, which is sandwiched between them, should be ""limited."" But now there is a recession, which is caused by the anti-reforms. The four pillars of the Hong Kong economy, namely financial services, tourism, trade and logistics, and professional and industrial and commercial support services, have been affected to varying degrees, especially in the tourism industry. Following visitor arrivals in July and August, respectively, the number of visitors decreased by 4.8% and 39.1% year-on-year. After continuing to decrease by 34.2% in September, the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, revealed that the number of visitors to Hong Kong fell by about 50% year-on-year in the first half of October. .


In the third quarter, Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) fell 2.9% year-on-year. Comparing quarterly, after falling 0.5% in the second quarter, the third quarter further fell by 3.2%, officially announcing Hong Kong's entry into a technical recession.

Hong Kong cut interest rates by 6 million to 8 million units
As for retail sales, the value of retail sales in Hong Kong in September was only 29.9 billion yuan, down 18.3% year-on-year. Before the anti-revision storm has subsided, looking forward to the upcoming Christmas and New Year traditional peak season, business is difficult to send high hopes. If we analyze the impact of interest rate cuts on the stock market, the main reason is that corporate financing costs have decreased, especially for heavy debt stocks and real estate stocks. As for the banking stocks, Morgan Stanley issued a report saying that because most of the deposit ratios of Hong Kong banks are linked to the savings rate, the proportion of assets linked to the best interest rate is small, which will help to slightly widen the net interest margin.
However, for the overall Hong Kong stock market, interest rate cuts are not comprehensive. The market outlook strategy is still focused on picking stocks and picking up the market. The 20 strong stocks selected in this issue of ""Cover Story"" should be closely watched. In fact, this time HSBC took the lead in cutting interest rates, the best is the property market. In the latest property policy report, Mrs Lam has relaxed the upper limit of 90% and 80% of mortgage insurance in the latest policy address, and immediately turned the property market into a real estate operation, especially the $6 million to $8 million flat. Hot.
Economic recession
Now, interest rates will be cut again, even if the actual effect is not large, such as borrowing 1 million yuan, 30 years of repayment period, only 66 yuan per month, and many owners have adopted interbank interest rate mortgages (H press), less P interest rate It has too much impact. But at least it can play a psychologically beneficial role, strengthen confidence in the property market, and support property prices. However, the long-term trend of property prices still depends on the economy. If the economy has not improved, the property market will only see the true chapter after digesting this round of purchasing power.
