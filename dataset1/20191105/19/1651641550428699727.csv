05 Nov 2019, 19:44 by Surur
Microsoft has updated the Edge Beta to build 79.0.309.11 as part of their 6-weekly update cycle. Microsoft does not normally release a changelog for the beta browser, but the update brings along a number of features that Microsoft has been testing in the Canary and Dev builds.
The last build has been v78.0.276.8 and even without a formal Edge beta build 79.0.309.11 changelog we know since then Microsoft has added PDF annotation, fluent design improvements, improved New Tab Page, Media Autoplay Block and much more. Windows 10 Insiders will also be blessed with the Edge Browser Logo.
Microsoft has also released a new Canary Build, taking that browser to build 80.0.323.0. While there is no formal Edge Canary build 80.0.323.0 changelog, the update does also bring the new logo to the browser for Windows 10 Insiders.
You can download the Edge Beta, which replaces your legacy Edge browser, from Microsoft here.
