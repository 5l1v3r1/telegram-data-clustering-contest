      <p>At Ignite, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/11/04/introducing-the-new-microsoft-edge-and-bing/#GS7gQIubeuJyLQQi.97">announced</a> the availability of the release candidate of the new Microsoft Edge for Windows and macOS. Microsoft also mentioned that the new Microsoft Edge will be generally available on Jan. 15 in more than 90 languages. Unlike the existing Edge browser, the new Microsoft Edge is powered by the same Chromium web engine that powers Google’s Chrome browser, so it will deliver great web compatibility and performance.</p>
      <p>On top of compatibility and performance, Microsoft will deliver new innovative features such as Collections, that let you more easily collect web content, organize your research and export that content into Word and Excel so that you can use the power of those applications to analyze information and collaborate. In this new Microsoft Edge, tracking prevention will be on by default. With SmartScreen and Tracking prevention, Microsoft will protect you from phishing schemes, malicious software and others. Microsoft Edge and Bing will also offer new InPrivate mode across your entire web experience. In this new mode, even your online searches and browsing are not attributed to you, offering you more control over your personal data.</p>
