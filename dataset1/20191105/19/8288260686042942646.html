      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news | Dean Smith's AVFC are said to be keen on the 23-year-old</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:17:44+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos has revealed he’s had no contact with any suitors about leaving Rangers in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> have been credited with a firm interest in the prolific striker who has already scored 20 goals this season.</p>
      <p>At 23, Morelos’ age would appeal to Villa who have been keen to recruit players with the potential to grow since <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> took charge.</p>
      <p>The Colombia international has been valued at around £20m and it remains to be seen whether Villa will make their move.</p>

      <p>But for now, Morelos has not held talks with any clubs about departing Ibrox in the New Year despite the rampant speculation which surrounds his future.</p>
      <p>The only side who have previously tried to prise him away are French club Bordeaux, who had a bid rejected in the summer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He told Antena 2: "There is much speculation about my departure, many teams that would be offering a good amount of money for me.</p>
      <p>"I have not talked to anyone, but if God allows it I think that many clubs can come for good performances.</p>
      <p>"But no, I've had no contact with anyone. The Bordeaux thing was true, but in the end no agreement was reached."</p>

      <p>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said at the weekend <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-aston-villa-transfer-17193842">that Morelos will "100 per cent" remain a Rangers player beyond January.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The forward added: "As a player he (Gerrard) also has his mistakes, I have learned a lot and Gerrard has advised me a lot.</p>
      <p>"The refereees always complicated me in that aspect (the cards) but I learned from that, I am doing things better and well in that sense.</p>
      <p>"With him I have a lot of confidence and he puts me to play as defined nine."</p>
