      <h1>AJ Pritchard 'confused' over Strictly judges' claims of missing element during routine</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli told AJ Pritchard and partner Saffron Barker their performance lacked hip action</h2>

      <p>AJ Pritchard has confessed he felt his latest performance on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> with celebrity partner Saffron Barker deserved a higher score from the judges.</p>
      <p>He also shared his confusion over Bruno Tonioli's claims the action-packed routine lacked hip action.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, the pair's Salsa to the track Instruction scored them an overall mark of 27 points.</p>
      <p>Criticism included Shirley Ballas feeling it needed a figure of eight, with also mention of there maybe being too much in the routine.</p>
      <p>But one thing there wasn't enough of, according to Bruno, was hip action.</p>

      <p>Now, AJ has confessed he failed to see what Bruno meant by this with him seeing plenty of hip in the routine from Saffron.</p>
      <p>It Takes Two host Ryan Clark-Neal also shared his puzzled reaction to the remarks, with him too sure he had noticed plenty of hip movement.</p>
      <p>As Rylan couldn't understand where Bruno was coming from, AJ said: "I was a bit confused myself."</p>

      <p>Of the score, he told Saffron: "I was a little bit sad, I felt like you could have got a higher mark."</p>
      <p>On comments over whether there was too much content going on, AJ defended their performance and said it would have been "boring" if done differently.</p>
      <p>He said: "I loved the dance and I think on the night, if we took stuff out to make it slower or more boring then it'd be boring."</p>

      <p>Saffron also said she was "proud" of the routine and how they performed it despite the comments.</p>
      <p>The pair made it through another week surviving the dreaded dance-off, as another couple was sent home.</p>
      <p>This week it was Emma Weymouth and Aljaž Škorjanec who lost out, with Katya Jones and Mike Bushell being saved by the judges.</p>
