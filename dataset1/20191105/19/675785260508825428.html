      <h1>Why no Ajax fans are at Chelsea for Champions League clash at Stamford Bridge</h1>
      <h2>The away end at Stamford Bridge has been covered completely by a banner as no Ajax fans were able to travel to Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:34:33+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>The away end at Stamford Bridge was left completely empty as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> took on Ajax in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Not a single Ajax fan travelled to the game after the Dutch club were banned from selling their allocation for the fixture.</p>
      <p>Ajax were banned from attending the fixture after crowd trouble in their game against Valencia at the Mestalla earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The ban comes after Ajax were handed a suspended sentence for a similar disturbance during their Champions League clash against Benfica last season.</p>
      <p>Eredivisie champions Ajax were also fined Â£43,200.</p>

      <p>Ajax fans are expected to be in London after thousands of fans had already booked travel and accommodation ready for the game.</p>
      <p>But they were left out of pocket after UEFA's decision to ban the Dutch travelling support.</p>
      <p>Initially, the group of over 2,000 Ajax fans were planning on heading to Leyton Orient's game in the EFL Trophy against Brighton's youth team as an alternative.</p>
      <p>Orient claimed that they would hold talks with Ajax officials on how they can accommodate their fans, in what would have been a huge boost for the League Two club's finances.</p>
      <p>But it was later decided that Orient's fixture would move over policing concerns.</p>
      <p>It leaves open the possibility of Chelsea stewards having to stop Ajax fans from getting into the ground.</p>
      <p>As a result, fans have been warned they should bring photo ID with them to the game.</p>
