Nico Hulkenberg ""pleased"" with his performance
05 Nov 2019, 19:36 by Louis Shaw

Nico Hulkenberg had another solid race at the US Grand Prix at the weekend. The Renault driver is having to drive his best to try and prove that he is still worthy of a seat in Formula 1. 

“I’m really happy to take two points today especially after losing some ground on lap one,"" Hulkenberg said after the race. ""It was a race of two, contrasting halves for us. The first part wasn’t great, we lost places at Turn 1 and Turn 2 on the opening lap with some cars coming back onto the track in front of me.




""That made things difficult, but then the second-half of the race was a lot of fun. We converted to a two-stop strategy, maybe a lap or two too late, which was my decision, but we then started catching others in front. We had good pace, some fun fights, so we can be pleased to score two points today.”




Hulkenberg has proved himself as a very consistent driver over this past season and will hope that he has done enough to earn a new contract at the top flight of motorsport.
