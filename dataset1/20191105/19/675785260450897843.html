      <h1>Man City boss Pep Guardiola backtracks on 'diving' claim about Liverpool star Sadio Mane</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp recently hit back at Guardiola, defending Mane and insisting he is not a con artist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:09:23+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola was forced into a humiliating climbdown over his controversial claim that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward Sadio Mane is a diver.</p>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp hit back at Guardiola, ahead of the title showdown with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield on Sunday, defending Mane and insisting he is not a con artist.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola, speaking ahead of City's Champions League tie with Atalanta on Wednesday night, reneged on his original remarks on Mane, admitting he was wrong with his remarks.</p>
      <p>“My son and my daughter, all the times when Liverpool win, say just how lucky, how lucky they are,” said Guardiola.</p>

      <p>“I said it's not lucky, what Liverpool have done in these last minutes, they have an incredible squad.</p>
      <p>"It can happen once or twice, but this is many times. Then, in the 94th minute against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , it was 'wow like this or like that for the penalty?'.</p>
      <p>"It was far from my intention to say Sadio is like that. I admire him a lot. I was the wrong guy to think it wasn't a penalty.</p>

      <p>"Like Jurgen says, he knows Sadio better than me. With Jurgen he tries to be positive, when he says it’s not like this. But my comments, what I said, was longer than the highlight, it was a praise for Liverpool, to say it was not just one action.</p>
      <p>"It happens many times because they continue to push, so hopefully I can clarify everything that Jurgen said."</p>
      <p>Mane was booked for diving before scoring a 94th-minute winner in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday.</p>
