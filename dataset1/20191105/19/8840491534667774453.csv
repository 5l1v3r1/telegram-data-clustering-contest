No increase in Mayo drug unit personnel over eight years

05 Nov 2019, 19:50

GARDA resources in Mayo aimed at tackling drug use has been neglected as the drug unit in the Division has the same number of personnel today as they did in 2011, says Fianna Fáil Deputy Dara Calleary.
New figures revealed to Fianna Fáil show numbers in the drug unit assigned to the Mayo Garda Division have remained stagnant, with only five garda personnel in the unit.
Deputy Calleary commented: “Despite an accelerated garda recruitment drive the drug unit in the Mayo Division has seen no increase in personnel.
“We had five garda personnel in the unit in 2011 and now in 2019, we still only have five people in this unit.
“I want to commend the work carried out by the drug unit. There has been significant drug seizures by gardaí in Mayo in recent times. There is a clampdown on organised crime in north Mayo which is welcome. Yet, with greater resources the drug unit could have more reach.
“I understand the Commissioner has said that additional resources are coming on stream. He has assigned resources to specialist bureaus such as the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau for next year.
“Extra resources in the drug unit are needed to tackle organised crime in Mayo.”
