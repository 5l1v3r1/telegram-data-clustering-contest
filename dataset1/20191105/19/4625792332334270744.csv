Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka was banned on YouTube for failing to adhere to copyright laws when he played music from the band Imagine Dragons without their permission.
The ardent Trump ally, 49, repeatedly played Imagine Dragons songs on his radio show, ""America First,"" but the band's lead singer Dan Reynolds asked him to stop. When he refused, YouTube deleted his channel Monday. A platform spokesperson told the Daily Beast that his channel ""was terminated due to multiple copyright strikes.""



""[T]hanks for bringing this to my attention. I’ve never given permission for this use. Please stop playing imagine dragons on your show @SebGorka,"" Reynolds tweeted back in August.
Reynolds then brought this issue back up on Oct. 24, tweeting that Universal Music Publishing Group had tried to block Gorka from uploading videos with their music.



""From Universal 'Confirming all 42 links are blocked, however, Gorka has uploaded more videos with the song in it. I will continue to monitor the page and submit links to be blocked daily,'"" he tweeted. ""[L]osing my mind on this. thanks for keeping on my radar. X.""
