      <p>Donald Trump Jr released a book Tuesday that rails against the left as he admitted he had caught the political bug and may consider running for office in the future.</p>
      <p>In "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence US," the president's son fiercely defends his father and slams mainstream media and political opponents including Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>"This is the book that the leftist elites don't want you to read!" screams a blurb on Amazon, adding that "no topic is spared from political correctness."</p>
      <p>Trump Jr dedicates the 300-page part memoir to "deplorables," a clear dig at Clinton who used the term to describe Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>The book quickly rose to third on Amazon's list of bestselling books after the president on Monday encouraged his 66.5 million Twitter followers to order a copy.</p>
      <p>"A great new book that I highly recommend for ALL to read," Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr, known for his virulent attacks on traditional media including The New York Times and the Washington Post, accuses social networks of trying to sensor him and other conservatives.</p>
      <p>"This 'shadow banning' amounts to a complete suppression of freedom of speech. It can't be allowed to continue," he writes in the book, taking aim at Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.</p>
      <p>While Ivanka Trump was thought to be the most political of the president's four adult children owing to her role as a White House adviser, Trump Jr hinted o Tuesday that he may be tempted to run one day.</p>
      <p>"I don't rule anything out. Right now I like the campaigning part. I actually enjoy some of that fight," he told CBS in an interview.</p>
      <p>"I like getting out there and being with real people and seeing the difference that my father and his policies are making in their lives.</p>
      <p>"I'm interested in winning 2020 for my father right now. We'll worry about everything else later," the 41-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"Triggered" is published by Center Street, a known publisher of conservative books.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr was to sign copies at a Barnes and Noble in Manhattan later on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The president has published several books, most famously "Trump: The Art of the Deal" in 1987 which became a New York Times bestseller</p>
