      <p>A teenager died after she was allegedly <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">raped</a> by a group of boys at a house party.</p>
      <p>Jhoselin Monica Calani, 17, attended the gathering at a friend's house on October 16. She is believed to have collapsed during the celebrations.</p>
      <p>It is believed she was then brutally raped by the group in Oruro, Bolivia.</p>
      <p>When she woke, Jhoselin complained of soreness in her hips and struggled to stand.</p>
      <p>She was dashed to hospital but died there two weeks later.</p>

      <p>Her grief-stricken mum now wants the four teenage boys arrested on suspicion of her rape to be prosecuted for murder or femicide.</p>
      <p>“I want to tell you those guys cannot go out, justice must be carried out, they must pay for what they did, they should not be punished with a minor penalty,” she said.</p>
      <p>Police continue to investigate the tragedy, and are questioning the suspects, each aged 16 or 17.</p>
      <p>Alcohol was served at the party, officers say.</p>
      <p>But they are exploring whether other drugs were also present.</p>

      <p>Orlando Zapata, the Oruro department attorney, said Jhoselin “did not remember what happened, she felt very cold and presented a strong pain in the hips”.</p>
      <p>Hundreds gathered to mourn Jhoselin at her funeral last week.</p>
      <p>It comes after seven gang rapes were reported in Bolivia between January and April 2019.</p>
