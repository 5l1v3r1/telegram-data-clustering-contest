      <p>Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka was banned on YouTube for failing to adhere to copyright laws when he played music from the band Imagine Dragons without their permission.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/youre-a-punk-sebastian-gorka-confronts-white-house-journalists-in-rose-garden">The ardent Trump ally</a>, 49, repeatedly played Imagine Dragons songs on his radio show, "America First," but the band's lead singer Dan Reynolds asked him to stop. When he refused, YouTube deleted his channel Monday. A platform spokesperson <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-bans-sebastian-gorka-because-he-wont-stop-playing-imagine-dragons?ref=scroll">told</a> the Daily Beast that his channel "was terminated due to multiple copyright strikes."</p>

      <p>"[T]hanks for bringing this to my attention. Iâ€™ve never given permission for this use. Please stop playing imagine dragons on your show @SebGorka," Reynolds tweeted back in August.</p>
      <p>Reynolds then brought this issue back up on Oct. 24, tweeting that Universal Music Publishing Group had tried to block Gorka from uploading videos with their music.</p>

      <p>"From Universal 'Confirming all 42 links are blocked, however, Gorka has uploaded more videos with the song in it. I will continue to monitor the page and submit links to be blocked daily,'" he tweeted. "[L]osing my mind on this. thanks for keeping on my radar. X."</p>
