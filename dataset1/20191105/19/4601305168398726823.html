      <p>In Indianapolis, a confused deer crashed through a glass window into a suburban school, sending teachers and students into security lockdown mode.</p>
      <p>Hinkle Creek Elementary School Principal Jack Lawrence told a reporter the deer smashed through a window Monday afternoon and entered the Noblesville schoolâ€™s main hallway.</p>
      <p>Students and staff at Hinkle Creek Elementary School in Noblesville are all okay. The windows were shattered. No word on the deer.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/hamilton-county/noblesville/2019/11/04/hinkle-creek-elementary-school-noblesville-indiana-deer-jump-window/4159675002/">indystar.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Principal Jack Lawrence told parents in an email that a deer jumped through a window, shattering it, in the school's main hallway at 1 p.m. Monday. The school immediately called for a lockdown to make sure students and staff remained inside their classrooms.<br/><br/>The deer eventually pushed its way out of the building's main entrance and ran through a parking lot into nearby woods, Lawrence said in the email. <br/><br/>No students or staff were hurt, and normal school operations resumed after a few minutes, he said.</blockquote>
