ISLAMABAD: Despite assurances by the Afghan foreign ministry, Pakistani diplomats continued to be harassed by intelligence officials in Afghanistan even after Islamabad conveyed its concerns to Kabul, sources told The Express Tribune on Tuesday.
After frequent reported cases of Pakistani diplomatic personnel’s harassment in the war-torn country, the Pakistan Foreign Office on Sunday summoned the Afghan chargé d’affaires and conveyed serious concerns over the safety and security of embassy staff in Kabul and its sub-missions.
Diplomatic sources said that the visa section of the Pakistan embassy in Kabul remained closed for the third consecutive day which came as a huge blow for many Afghans, hundreds of whom apply daily for permits to travel to Pakistan where they seek medical treatment, goods and university educations.



Pakistan accused Afghan authorities for harassing its diplomats in Kabul for the past few days.
“As for the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic Missions in Afghanistan, who are being systematically harassed for the past few days, our concerns have already been conveyed to the Afghan government,” a statement issued by the Foreign Office on Tuesday said.
“We urge the Afghan authorities to take immediate steps to ensure safety and security of the personnel of Pakistan’s diplomatic Missions in Afghanistan,” it added.
