      <p>LISBON, Portugal - A delegation of Brazilian Indigenous leaders is seeking to recruit European political support against incursions by loggers and cattle ranchers in the Amazon and the destruction of rainforest.</p>
      <p>Sonia Guajajara, a former Brazilian vice-presidential candidate, is a prominent voice in efforts to protect the Amazon. She tells The Associated Press her group is visiting a dozen European countries in a 35-day tour.</p>
      <p>She said Tuesday that the delegation is meeting with political and religious leaders, companies and activists.</p>
      <p>The group wants the European Union to scrap a planned trade deal with Latin America that they say would bring further clearing of Amazon land.</p>
      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wants to ease restrictions on the development of nature reserves and Indigenous lands.</p>
      <p>European countries have invested in rainforest protection programs.</p>
