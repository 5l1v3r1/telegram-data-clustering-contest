      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.l.Â (AP)</b> - Child abuse and neglect reports from Providence students have stayed high since Rhode Island passed a mandatory reporting law in 2016.</p>
      <p>WPRI-TV reports the state Department of Children, Youth and Families found evidence of abuse or neglect in 128 reports in 2016 compared to 56 a year earlier. There were more than 400 such reports in each of the following two years.</p>
      <p>The law requires school employees to report any knowledge of sexual abuse to DCYF within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers say the numbers mean abuse is being reported that may not have been in the past.</p>
      <p>Others say the law has created confusion, leading to overreporting and making it harder for authorities to sift through reports.</p>
      <p>Police charged 32 people for child abuse last year, a 45% increase since 2015.</p>
