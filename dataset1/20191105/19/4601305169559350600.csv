Man used electric shopping cart to get from one bar to another

A Louisiana gentleman who enjoys consuming large amounts of alcohol tried a novel way to avoid drunk driving charges or a DUI conviction.
Go barhopping in an electric shopping cart.
His method does not seem to have entirely worked out for him, despite being clever.
The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana reports in this news release that one Brice Kendell Williams, 32, is charged with having removed the cart from a Walmart in Houma to a bar about half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away, during a drunken spree last Sunday.
Snip from their Facebook post:



From AP:
Col. Terry Daigre says a deputy found the cart parked between two cars in the bar’s parking lot.The sheriff’s office says Williams told the deputy he thought he might get charged with DWI if he drove his own vehicle from bar to bar.Williams was arrested nevertheless, and charged with felony “unauthorized use of a movable.” It’s unclear whether he had an attorney to speak for him.
