        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Cambridge University has accepted an equivalent of $7.7 million in funding from the Shell oil and gas giant for a group that will research the use of a magnetic resonance technology for oil extraction, the Guardian newspaper said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The donation was approved in March but was not disclosed in July when the academic yearâ€™s donations were made public, according to <i>the Guardian newspaper</i>.</p>
      <p>The daily quoted the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909111076772605-cambridge-university-press-removes-textbook-over-soft-porn-photos-allegations/">British university</a> as saying that the cash injection was "the final gift" in a commitment made in 2014 before it had agreed to set out plans for divesting from energy companies.</p>
      <p>The university reportedly argued that the Shell-funded research would look into ways of "making chemical processes for industrial use more sustainable" to back its zero carbon emissions goal.</p>
      <p>However, the paper found that hydrocarbon recovery would remain among the researched areas. The university page of research leader Lynn Gladden lists magnetic resonance as a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201803131062497148-russian-oil-extraction-efficiency-program/">method used in oil recovery</a> to assess the fluid composition within oil-bearing rocks.</p>
