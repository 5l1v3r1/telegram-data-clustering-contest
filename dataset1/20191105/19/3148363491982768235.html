      <h1>Officials Deny Library Funding for Digital Subscription to 'Fake News' NYT</h1>
      <h2>A library system was denied its request for a digital subscription to the New York Times after Florida officials called the newspaper “fake news.”</h2>

      <p>“Fake news, I agree with President Trump,” Citrus County Commissioner Scott Carnahan <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2019/11/04/commissioners-call-new-york-times-fake-news-deny-library-funding-for-digital-subscriptions/">said</a> during an October 24 meeting to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/11/05/fake-news-florida-county-officials-reject-new-york-times-library-subscription/#54c33ed3678a">decide</a> if the county should spend about $2,700 each year to give their 70,000 library patrons access to the digital version.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want the <i>New York Times</i> in this county. I don’t agree with it, I don’t like ’em, it’s fake news and I’m voting no. They can take that money and do something else with it … I support Donald Trump,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>Carnahan then apologized to the library director, Eric Head, who originally suggested the county buy a group subscription, but stated that residents who wanted to read the newspaper could pay for it themselves.</p>
      <p>“Sorry Eric, I know you have 140 readers, but those guys can subscribe it and have it come to their home. I support Donald Trump,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>Several of the other commissioners echoed Carnahan’s statement and questioned why the purchase was necessary when they did not know how many people read the <i>Times</i>.</p>
      <p>“How many people are actually reading that for the twenty-seven-hundred dollars a year? That’s my problem with it,” one commissioner said.</p>
      <p>“Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?” another <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/citruscounty/citrus-county-new-york-times-subscription-commissioners/67-c7ebe353-a05f-4ca4-9ee5-05b44d868a8c">commented</a>.</p>
      <p>Even though the print edition is available at all four of the regional libraries, which already costs the county $3,000 annually, Sandy Price, who is chairwoman for the library system’s advisory board, said she did not agree with recent the decision.</p>
      <p>“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” she <a href="https://www.chronicleonline.com/news/local/board-s-ny-times-decision-catches-public-s-ire/article_196d5d2a-f9cb-11e9-b4a5-cf20e35c898d.html">told</a> the <i>Citrus County Chronicle</i>, adding, “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented.”</p>
      <p>However, commissioner Brian Coleman said that he regrets how the matter was addressed.</p>
      <p>“Do I think I made a mistake? Yes,” he stated. “Our decision should have been impartial, instead of having it become a personal thing.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Carnahan said his vote was not motivated by his opinion of the newspaper, but the cost to residents.</p>
      <p>“I’m open to a free press. Not at the taxpayers’ expense,” he commented.</p>
      <p>The proposal was withdrawn during the initial meeting, but the library’s district advisory board is scheduled to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue again on November 19, according to WTSP.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Head noted that the print edition would not be replaced by the digital subscription unless it proved popular with the county’s residents.</p>
