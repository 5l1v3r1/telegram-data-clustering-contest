Chris Evans Prefers Thor’s Hammer to Captain America’s Shield
05 Nov 2019, 19:58 by Robert Workman
While it’s been a few months since Avengers: Endgame’s release, there are many moments that still stick with fans — like Captain America finally wielding the power of Mjolnir.
Chris Evans actually had something to say about that moment when he recently stopped by The Tonight Show. Evans admitted he likes Thor’s hammer more than Cap’s shield. When Fallon asked about which of the two Evans preferred, he answered quickly: “Hammer.”
“Well, you know, the shield was destined for the character,” explained Evans. “The hammer was kind of this period at the end of a sentence in terms of his worth, and it was nice. And the (film directors Joe and Anthony) Russos really know how to build those moments. I’ll say the hammer.”

Evans also shared another humorous story about how he spoiled a key moment for co-star Anthony Mackie.
“I didn’t know he didn’t know what was going to happen,” said Evans, regarding the passing of Cap’s shield. “And I said, ‘Hey, man, isn’t that scene fantastic?’ He was like, ‘What scene?’ I said, ‘The scene where I give you the shield.’ He said, ‘You’re giving me the shield?!’ And I said, ‘Oh, no!’” 
Avengers: Endgame is available now on 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD and digital formats.
