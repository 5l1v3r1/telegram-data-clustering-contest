      <h1>Shakira to perform Latin tribute alongside J.Lo at Super Bowl</h1>

      <p>BARCELONA, Spain -- Colombian music star Shakira says she will pay homage to Latin culture alongside Jennifer Lopez at the 2020 Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show in Miami.</p>
      <p>Speaking Monday in Barcelona, Spain where she lives with her long-term partner, Spanish soccer star Gerard Pique, and their two children, Shakira told The Associated Press she was fulfilling a dream which also had "a very important purpose."</p>
      <p>"To celebrate that culture, to showcase it in a country where Latinos have also struggled a lot," she said. "I feel really humbled and with a great responsibility in my hands to represent the Latino community."</p>
      <p>The Grammy winner, who turns 43 on Feb. 2, the day of the Super Bowl, is currently promoting a documentary and live concert album from her 2018 "El Dorado World Tour," to be released worldwide on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>In late 2017, Shakira left fans worried after she was forced to postpone the European part of the tour due to a vocal cord hemorrhage.</p>
      <p>"That was probably one of the most difficult times of my life. It was really a nightmare," she recalled. "I didn't know if I was ever going to sing again."</p>
      <p>At the time, doctors recommended surgery that carried risks. Shakira chose not to have it, and her voice slowly recovered. But it meant she couldn't speak for long periods of time -- a real challenge for a mother of two young children.</p>
      <p>"I healed miraculously, really, because the doctors were convinced I needed a medical procedure," she said, adding that without support from her fans she wouldn't have been able to return to the stage.</p>
      <p>"I felt so much gratitude, so much joy to be able to sing again," she said. "I think at some point in my life I had taken it for granted."</p>
      <p>But the singer has not slowed down since releasing last month a remix of the song "Tutu" with singers Camilo from Colombian and Pedro Capo of Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Shakira is also scheduled to perform at the closing ceremony of the Davis Cup tennis tournament in Madrid on Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>Shakira has in the meantime witnessed turmoil in the city she calls home in Spain's northwest region of Catalonia.</p>
      <p>The conviction of Catalan separatists over an illegal independence referendum has sparked massive and sometimes violent street protests.</p>
      <p>Shakira says the issue requires dialogue between the separatists and Spain's national authorities. Pique backs the right to a vote on the region's independence.</p>
      <p>"I think that in a country where there are clearly disagreements and differences like this one, the best would be to try to build bridges and listen to each other," Shakira said.</p>
