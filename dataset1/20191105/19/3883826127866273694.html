        <b>Red deer in the Highlands are evolving because of climate change, a 45-year study has found.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scientists say they have seen genetic changes in birth patterns of deer on the Isle of Rum.</p>
      <p>Not only do warmer temperatures encourage deer to give birth earlier in the year, it has also meant the gene for breeding earlier has become more common among Rum deer.</p>
      <p>Researchers said it was "rare" to see evolution over such a short period.</p>
      <h3>Why has it happened?</h3>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that the deer have been giving birth earlier since the 1980s, at a rate of about three days per decade.</p>
      <p>This is partly due to the effects of warmer temperatures on the deer's behaviour and physiology.</p>
      <p>Now researchers are saying that the deer who give birth earlier have more calves over their lifetime - which means they have more reproductive success.</p>
      <p>The gene which causes earlier birth is therefore much more common among the Rum deer population over time.</p>
      <p>This is an example of natural selection, the theory of evolution developed by Charles Darwin.</p>
      <h3>'Evolution in action'</h3>
      <p>A team, including scientists from the University of Edinburgh, made the discovery using field records and genetic data collected on Rum over a 45-year period since 1972.</p>
      <p>The research also involved scientists from the Australian National University and the universities of St Andrews and Cambridge.</p>
      <p>Dr Timoth√©e Bonnet, of the Australian National University, who led the study, said they had "documented evolution in action".</p>

      <p>He added that the research showed that natural selection "may help populations adapt to climate warming."</p>
      <p>However, Robin Parker from WWF Scotland said urgent action was needed to reduce climate change.</p>
      <p>He said: "Climate change is here and this report highlights the impact our changing climate is already having on animals.</p>
      <p>"In order to tackle the joint nature and climate emergencies we face, it's vital we accelerate action to slash our emissions.</p>
      <p>"In doing this we can protect our precious wildlife, while also creating a healthier, fairer and more prosperous Scotland for us all."</p>
