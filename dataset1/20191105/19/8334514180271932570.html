      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Tuesday that Iran’s decision to take a new step to reduce commitments to a landmark 2015 nuclear deal posed a threat to Britain’s national security.</p>
      <p>Iran said on Monday it had launched a new batch of advanced centrifuges to accelerate uranium enrichment, following the withdrawal from the nuclear pact by the United States.</p>
      <p>“Iran’s latest actions clearly contravene the deal and pose a risk to our national security,” Raab said.</p>
      <p>“We want to find a way forward through constructive international dialogue but Iran needs to stand by the commitments it made and urgently return to full compliance.”</p>
