        <b>A BMW convertible was stopped by police after it was spotted being used to transport a double bed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A picture posted online by Essex Police shows the roof down and a mattress and bed frame upright on the back seat.</p>
      <p>Officers on patrol stopped the vehicle at Great Bentley near Colchester and wrote about the "insecure load" on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Using the face palm emoji, they said the female driver had told them "it's wedged in the seat so it's okay".</p>
      <p>Other Twitter users responded in disbelief, calling it "beyond a joke" and "absolutely baffling".</p>
