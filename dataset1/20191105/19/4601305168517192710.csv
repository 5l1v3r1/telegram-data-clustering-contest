Watch Teller almost get SHOCKED by dangerous jugglers The Passing Zone, on 'Penn & Teller: Fool Us!'
05 Nov 2019, 19:40 by Xeni Jardin



This is a great clip. If you're into jugglers doing funny things or 500-volt stun guns, you're in for a treat.
Jon and Owen of the wonderful performance group 'The Passing Zone' joined Penn & Teller on their TV show ""Penn & Teller: Fool Us!"" recently to perform a dangerous magic and juggling trick involving electricity.
Watch the magic, and check out Teller almost getting shocked!
Jon Wee and Owen Morse are friends of mine, and as crazy as they are in this video, they are in person. They're delightful humans with insanely curious intelligent minds and a wonderful knack for pulling off the impossible.
If you ever have a chance to see The Passing Zone perform live on stage in person (they also do trade shows and corporate events) go do it.
Their 'America's Got Talent' clip with Howie Mandel is also a thing of greatness, and legendary.
