A teenager died after she was allegedly raped by a group of boys at a house party.
Jhoselin Monica Calani, 17, attended the gathering at a friend's house on October 16. She is believed to have collapsed during the celebrations.
It is believed she was then brutally raped by the group in Oruro, Bolivia.
When she woke, Jhoselin complained of soreness in her hips and struggled to stand.
She was dashed to hospital but died there two weeks later.


The tragic teenager was laid to rest recently

Her grief-stricken mum now wants the four teenage boys arrested on suspicion of her rape to be prosecuted for murder or femicide.
“I want to tell you those guys cannot go out, justice must be carried out, they must pay for what they did, they should not be punished with a minor penalty,” she said.
Police continue to investigate the tragedy, and are questioning the suspects, each aged 16 or 17.
Alcohol was served at the party, officers say.
But they are exploring whether other drugs were also present.


Police in Oruro, west Bolivia, continue to investigate

Orlando Zapata, the Oruro department attorney, said Jhoselin “did not remember what happened, she felt very cold and presented a strong pain in the hips”.
Hundreds gathered to mourn Jhoselin at her funeral last week.
It comes after seven gang rapes were reported in Bolivia between January and April 2019.
