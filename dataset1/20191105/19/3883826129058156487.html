        <b>A man running to be an MP in Reading has been criticised after his website mistook part of Scotland for the town.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Craig Morley, Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate (PPC) for Reading East, had a picture of Melrose Abbey in Scotland rather than Reading Abbey ruins on his homepage.</p>
      <p>Labour councillor Richard Davies, who spotted the error, said he was amazed by the mistake.</p>
      <p>Mr Morley said the mistake was made by his web designer.</p>

      <p>Reading borough councillor Mr Davies said: "It's amazing that he wasn't able to identify our most important heritage asset and one that the council worked hard with local people to restore and re-open to the public.</p>
      <p>"It would be obvious to anyone who had visited Reading Abbey ruins that that picture was of a totally different place."</p>
      <p>Mr Morley has now corrected the error, according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs">Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>.</p>
      <p>The Reading-born PPC, who said he lived in the constituency, said: "The abbey is an important landmark of the town - I grew up with its imprint on the Reading landscape.</p>
      <p>"My website designer added the wrong image in my website banner header.</p>
      <p>"It was an easy mistake for an external agency to make."</p>
      <p>He added he had been too busy meeting residents to check his website header.</p>
