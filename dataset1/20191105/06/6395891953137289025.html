      <p><b>CINCINNATIÂ (AP)</b> - A prosecutor says a man accused in the apparent overdose death of a jail inmate awaiting trial on charges of driving over a curb and killing a toddler in a stroller has been indicted in Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters (DEE' turz) says 27-year-old Kadeem Kelley was indicted Monday on involuntary manslaughter and drug charges in 31-year-old Satwinder Singh's death at the county jail. Authorities say Singh was found unresponsive in his cell in March and died.</p>
      <p>Deters says Kelley also was being held in the jail and worked as a porter, serving food to inmates. Authorities say he allegedly supplied drugs to Singh.</p>
      <p>Court records don't show an attorney for Kelley.</p>
      <p>Singh faced charges including aggravated vehicular homicide in the 2-year-old boy's death.</p>
