Panipat trailer: Arjun Kapoor manages to impress as a brave Maratha warrior
05 Nov 2019, 06:48 by TIMESOFINDIA.COM
Finally after a long wait, the trailer of Ashutosh Gowarikar's magnum opus project 'Panipat' is out.
This three minute, forty one seconds of video reminds us of 'Bajirao Mastani' + 'Padmavat', however the film focuses on the battle fought and not the romantic side, plus it belongs to an era where such fights between Peshwas and Mughals were fought hence one would see the similarities.
Talking about Arjun Kapoor's character Sadashivrao Bhau, he has not overdone his role in the movie, he’s subtle and good, while Kriti Sanon will remind you of Priyanka Chopra from 'Bajirao Mastani', she will also be seen fighting the battle with Arjun as this was the first battle where they also took women to fight. On the other hand, Sanjay Dutt's intense villainous character speaks volumes.
The film deals with a journey to reach the battle ground and fight the Mughals where Peshwas lost, but the overall experience will speak volumes - and with Ashutosh Gowariker calling the shots we do have some high hopes. The background score is the soul of the movie.
