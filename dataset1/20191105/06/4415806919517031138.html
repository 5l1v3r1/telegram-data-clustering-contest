      <p>The youngest convicted murderers in the history of the State are to be sentenced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Two 15-year-old boys, known as Boy A and Boy B, were found guilty in June of murdering 14-year-old Ana Kriegel.</p>
      <p>The schoolgirl’s naked body was found in an abandoned farmhouse in Lucan, Co Dublin, last May after she had been reported missing by her parents.</p>
      <p>Boy A was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault.</p>
      <p>They have both been granted lifelong anonymity due to their age.</p>
      <p>Justice Paul McDermott had previously reserved sentencing until a number of psychological, psychiatric and social work reports could be compiled.</p>
      <p>The sentencing will be the first of its kind in Ireland due to the killers’ young age.</p>
      <p>Both boys are currently in custody in Oberstown Detention Centre in north Dublin.</p>
      <p>Last week at a sentencing hearing at Dublin’s Central Criminal Court, the court heard from Ana’s mother, Geraldine Kriegel.</p>

      <p>In her victim impact statement, Mrs Kriegel told the court that Ana’s murder has left an emptiness in the lives of all who knew her.</p>
      <p>“There is an emptiness in our lives. Life without Ana is no longer a life,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It is a misery we must endure for the rest of our lives.”</p>
      <p>The court also heard from the grandfather of Boy A, who said his grandson is “incredibly sorry” for what happened.</p>
      <p>The court earlier heard how Boy A has accepted he caused the death of Ana.</p>

      <p>A solicitor for Boy B said it is clear from the reports that his client does not accept the murder of Ana, adding that there had been a falling out between Boy B and his father, who was not in court, and explained that it was over Boy B’s failure to intervene and assist Ana.</p>
      <p>He asked the court to be as lenient as possible in the sentencing, adding that no DNA belonging to Boy B was found at the disused farmhouse.</p>
