SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Nov 5): Malaysia’s ringgit touches a three-month high as traders position themselves before a central bank policy decision later on Tuesday. The majority of economists predict the central bank will keep rates on hold.
* USD/MYR is little changed at 4.1510 after dropping to 4.1467, lowest since Aug. 2; pair declined for 8 straight days through Monday
* Sixteen of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast Bank Negara Malaysia will leave its benchmark rate at 3%; the remainder forecast a 25bp cut
** Decision is due at 3pm local time
* “The ringgit has been in an uptrend as it catches up with other Asian currencies as risk sentiment has improved due to optimism over U.S.-China trade talks,” says Kota Hirayama, a senior emerging-market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo
** Underlying sentiment for ringgit remains bullish and it’s likely to advance toward 4.10 per dollar
** Ringgit may also have benefited from report that Southeast Asian nations and several other countries have concluded the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade deal
* Global funds sold a net $15.6m of local equities on Monday: exchange data
* Malaysia’s 10-year bond yield is little changed at 3.41%
* Malaysia has earned about RM7b from its tax-amnesty program, through the Internal Revenue Board still finalizing the amount, New Straits Times said, citing Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng
