      <p>SINGAPORE (CNN) - Singapore has banned the riding of e-scooters on sidewalks in the city-state from Monday, November 4 after a growing number of accidents involving the motorized devices, including at least one fatality.</p>
      <p>Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min said in parliament Sunday that there would be an advisory period until December 31, involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URWG3kOZ2IA">warnings for riders.</a></p>
      <p>But after January 1, 2020, there would be "strict enforcement" of the new laws. "Those caught riding on e-scooter on footpaths will be liable for a fine of $1,472 (SGD$2000) and, or, jail up to three months," Lam said.</p>
      <p>It is expected that other personal mobility devices (PMDs), like hoverboards and electric bikes, could fall under the ruling as well.</p>
      <p>The move came shortly after the death of a 65-year-old woman who collided with an e-scooter while riding her bike in late September. According to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/brother-of-fatal-accident-victim-backs-e-scooter-ban-on-footpaths">the Straits Times,</a> she died in the hospital from a brain injury several days after the accident.</p>
      <p>Lam said that the calls for a ban had been getting louder after an increasing number of road accidents and continued abuse of e-scooter regulations. He added the laws would not extend to people with disabilities, as wheelchairs are a kind of PMDs as well.</p>
      <p>Singapore is not alone in banning the motorized scooters from its sidewalks. The devices are no longer allowed on sidewalks in France, after thousands of e-scooters began to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/paris-electric-scooters-ban-intl/index.html">cause tensions with residents.</a></p>
      <p>But the fines there are almost a tenth of the size of Singapore's, coming in at just $150 (135 euros).</p>
      <p>Minister Lam said that the convenience of e-scooters for commuting and food delivery services had led them to grow rapidly to almost 100,000 devices across the city.</p>
      <p>He said they'd tried to regulate them by putting in place safe-riding programs, speed limits and licenses for riders, but it hadn't been enough to curb accidents.</p>
      <p>"We continue to encounter errant riders who use non-compliant devices and ride dangerously," he said.</p>
      <p>Lam said 370 offenders were caught on average a month violating e-scooter regulations, leading to an increasing number of accidents.</p>
      <p>"This ban of e-scooters from footpaths is a difficult decision but it is a necessary step for pedestrians to feel safe again on public paths," he said.</p>
