      <h1>Dwarf dumped by adoptive parents denies being 'adult sociopath who posed as kid'</h1>
      <h2>Natalia Grace Barnett broke down in tears as she denied pretending to be a child in an interview on the US TV show Dr Phil</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:37:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:37</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A dwarf allegedly abandoned by her adoptive parents has denied their claims she was an 'adult sociopath posing as a child'.</p>
      <p>Natalia Grace Barnett defended herself in a dramatic interview with Dr Phil, insisting she was a child when she lived in the American couple's home.</p>
      <p>Kristine and Michael Barnett were arrested for child abuse in September for allegedly leaving Natalia in an apartment and moving to Canada with their other children.</p>
      <p>The alleged victim claims she was nine at the time, although the Barnetts say she was 22-years-old.</p>
      <p>They also accused her of trying to kill members of the family and smearing blood over mirrors.</p>

      <p>The couple adopted Natalia in 2010, when they thought she was six-years-old, before allegedly abandoning her in 2013.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian, who is now living with a Christian American family, claimed to be 16-years-old in a new interview with American TV star Dr Phil.</p>
      <p>Responding to the Barnetts allegations that she was an adult, Natalia said: "It's not true.</p>

      <p>"It's not true at all. I just want people to hear my side."</p>
      <p>Her new adoptive mum Cynthia Mans, who sat alongside her for the interview, said her daughter had bone scans which prove her real age.</p>
      <p>The Barnetts previously claimed a bone scan they paid for indicated she was born in 1989, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7648677/Ukrainian-dwarf-abandoned-adoptive-parents-breaks-silence-TV-interview.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>

      <p>They even alleged that their adopted daughter attempted to kill them and their sons.</p>
      <p>The Barnetts had Natalia's age changed to 22 and later rented an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana, in 2013 and left her there alone, according to police.</p>
      <p>Mrs Mans said she was not concerned about taking in Natalia and allowing her to mingle with her other children, despite the terrifying accusations levelled against her.</p>
      <p>She added: "We're supposed to help. Me and my husband adopted these kids.</p>
      <p>"It's like, who would do it if you don't?"</p>

      <p>Ms Barnett claimed Natalia had already started her period and was trying to cover it up when she was adopted.</p>
      <p>She added that the Ukrainian had adult teeth and full pubic hair.</p>
      <p>The mother also said doctors examined Natalia and concluded she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.</p>
      <p>This illness supposedly led to her jumping from moving cars and smearing blood over mirrors.</p>
