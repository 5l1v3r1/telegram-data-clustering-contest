Mom shares an emotional post about her austistic son! We all need to read this

Even though being disabled doesn't make you different, the world can be a little harsh and less understanding for kids who suffer from any form of disability. Autism is one such developmental disability that affects kids.
Autism is a genetic problem that impairs brain function and also affects important speech, communication, and interactive skills. No two autism patients are the same and all symptoms present differently. However, the fact they find it difficult to behave or react to situations, it can be hard to find acceptance. Lack of awareness and empathy can push the stigma around. As a parent, this can be daunting.
A woman in America has now gone viral on the internet after detailing one such incident which happened with her son, who suffers from autism.
Kerry Bloch and her husband Robert are parents to David, who suffers from a severe form of autism. As a young child, David was diagnosed with the brain disorder at the age of 4 and as one of the side effects, he was often shunned away and found it rather difficult to make friends. To add to the problem, David also suffers from a sensitive immunodeficiency problem, which meant that fearing infections, he had to spend time in care, away from people and that further pushed him to isolation. He couldn't even speak, only until the last month.
When David did start speaking, his parents couldn't be any happier. However, they were not ready for what came after that.
David saw people on TV laughing and hanging out together and then came up with a question- wondering why he couldn't be like the people he saw on the television and asked this, “Would someone like me?”
This one question broke his mom's heart. Kerry, who considers her son a ""best friend"" did not know how to respond to this.



While Kerry is his caregiver and has helped him lead an almost normal life, she was extremely sad at David having to miss out on this part of his life. In an emotional tweet, he said:
“He wants friends badly. He’s home-schooled, and it’s just the three of us,” she said.
“I know he’s lonely and he wants friends.”
“I had to go off and cry when he didn’t see me because it’s just kind of bittersweet that he’s trapped in there. He does want to be liked, and he does want friends, and he doesn’t know how to make them.”
While as a mother, Kerry did try to comfort her son, she wanted to get rid of the stigma and make more people aware, that autistic or any specially-abled kids are no different than the normal kids.
Posting the update on her Twitter account, soon enough, she was flooded with responses! Messages poured in from people, all across the world, letting Kerry's son know that he had millions of friends- and that he would be never alone.
Seeing her tweet, parents of other autistic children also wrote in, sympathizing with them and sharing their woes.
Needless to say, the mom is incredibly happy with the responses and beautiful messages, which she had never expected. She sat down with her son and read out the wishes. In a report, she said,
“It’s mind-boggling. I’m overwhelmed,” she said. “David and I stayed up all night last night. All we did was stay on Twitter and I would read every tweet to him. I would show him the responses, the little GIFs, the pictures people were sending. He didn’t answer much, but he would say ‘pretty’ and ‘nice.’ You could see him just smiling. I’ve never seen him smile so much in my life.”
The internet isn't always a bad space, right?
