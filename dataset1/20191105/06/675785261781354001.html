      <h1>Jorge Masvidal calls out Canelo Alvarez as he eyes boxing switch</h1>
      <h2>The welterweight beat Nate Diaz at UFC 244 on Saturday and is now eyeing a fight with the Alvarez</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:01:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>UFC star Jorge Masvidal has said he is "dead serious" about wanting to fight Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez after calling out the boxing world champion on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mexican boxer Alvarez was crowned a four-weight world champion as he beat Sergey Kovalev by an 11th-round stoppage at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas to claim the WBO light-heavyweight belt.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who has been defeated just once in 56 fights, had also won world titles at light-middleweight, middleweight and super-middleweight before his latest victory.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, Masvidal was crowned the 'Baddest Motherf*****' in the UFC when his fight with Nate Diaz was stopped in the third round at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>Although he said was a open to a rematch with Diaz, Masvidal also raised the possibility of switching codes to fight the Mexican.</p>

      <p>Asked about his potential upcoming fights in his <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/2/20942916/ufc-244-post-fight-press-conference-video-live-stream-diaz-masvidal-till-gastelum-results-bmf-espn">post-fight press conference</a> , the 34-year-old said: "If Canelo wants to get his ass kicked, that's a fight I'll take."</p>
      <p>“I can box, I can hit hard, I can work different angles and I'm not going to get tired over the 12 rounds, especially if I have time to prepare for it.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it's fate that I fought today and he did too. I would like to break his face and I would just like to fight him and test myself."</p>
      <p>It would not be the first time an MMA star has traded the Octagon for the boxing ring after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> fought Floyd Mayweather in 2017.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The fight generated huge hype and although McGregor was beaten, Masvidal is confident he could put on a good performance.</p>
      <p>When asked further about a potential bout on Monday, the welterweight star told <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/28008183/ufc-jorge-masvidal-dead-serious-wanting-canelo-alvarez-fight">Ariel Helwani's MMA Show on ESPN</a> : “I’m dead serious about fighting Canelo Alvarez.</p>
      <p>"Is Canelo a better boxer than me? Has he thrown 10,000 jabs more than me, cause that's what he does morning and night cause he's just boxing? Yeah. He's a better boxer.</p>

      <p>"But can I bring some elements that boxers ain't used to that are in the legal realm of boxing and throw Canelo completely off his game? F*** yes.</p>
      <p>"I'm a naturally bigger dude and I punch like a f****** truck. With boxing gloves on I'm not afraid of breaking my hand because I have that cast [of tape] on, it will be a little bit harder.</p>
      <p>"I feel I can be a legitimate threat in there."</p>
