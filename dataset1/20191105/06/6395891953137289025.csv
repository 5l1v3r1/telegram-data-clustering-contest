CINCINNATI (AP) - A prosecutor says a man accused in the apparent overdose death of a jail inmate awaiting trial on charges of driving over a curb and killing a toddler in a stroller has been indicted in Cincinnati.
Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters (DEE' turz) says 27-year-old Kadeem Kelley was indicted Monday on involuntary manslaughter and drug charges in 31-year-old Satwinder Singh's death at the county jail. Authorities say Singh was found unresponsive in his cell in March and died.
Deters says Kelley also was being held in the jail and worked as a porter, serving food to inmates. Authorities say he allegedly supplied drugs to Singh.
Court records don't show an attorney for Kelley.
Singh faced charges including aggravated vehicular homicide in the 2-year-old boy's death.
