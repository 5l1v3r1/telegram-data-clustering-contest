      <h1>Scott McKenna set for Scotland fast track as Steve Clarke ponders Liam Kelly return</h1>
      <h2>Clarke will name the stopper as part of his squad for this month's double header.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Scott McKenna will return to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a>’s Scotland squad as the manager attempts to stiffen up his defence ahead of the Euro 2020 playoffs.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> centre-back will be named as part of Clarke’s latest travelling party for this month’s final dead rubber of a double header in Cyprus and at home to Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Clarke axed veteran Charlie Mulgrew last time out for a win over San Marino after blaming the Blackburn man for the 4-0 rout <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> suffered against Russia in Moscow.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock’s Stuart Findlay, who is currently injured, and McKenna’s Aberdeen team-mate Mikey Devlin were paired up in the centre of Clarke’s defence for that 6-0 thrashing against the Group I whipping boys at Hampden.</p>

      <p>But with McKenna now getting back to fitness and form at Pittodrie the 22-year-old looks set to be fast-tracked straight back into Clarke’s starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Keeper Liam Kelly is in contention for a recall after cementing his place at QPR.</p>
      <p>The former Livingston and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> keeper has played in the last six Championship matches for Mark Warburton’s side.</p>
