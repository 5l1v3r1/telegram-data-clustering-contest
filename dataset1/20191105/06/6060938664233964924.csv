Arjun Kapoor is an avid social media user and his hilarious comments on his pals' post grabbed everyone's attention within no time. The talented actor took to social media yesterday to share the looks of the lead cast from his upcoming film 'Panipat'.
Not only Kriti Sanon and Sanjay Dutt's first look but Arjun even shared his own Sadashiv Rao Bhau look and his sister Janhvi Kapoor just couldn't keep calm but praise her brother's look and hard work.



Arjun had kept this look from the upcoming periodic drama under wraps for a long time and used to don a cap whenever he used to step out for a few months but his first look seems to justify the suspense now.
'Panipat' which is being helmed by Ashutosh Gowariker also features Padmini Kolhapure, Zeenat Aman and Mohnish Bahl in supporting roles and is slated to release on 6th December.
Meanwhile, on the other hand, Janhvi has her kitty full with an interesting line-up of films comprising of 'Gunjan Saxena-The Kargil Girl', 'Dostana 2', 'Roohi Afza' and Karan Johar's magnum opus periodic film 'Takht'.
