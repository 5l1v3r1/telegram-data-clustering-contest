Watch This New Zealand Politician Drop A Casual “OK Boomer” While Being Heckled
05 Nov 2019, 06:01 by Patrick Lenton
This might signal the death-knell of the OK Boomer meme, but it’s still very funny: a New Zealand MP very casually fired back with “OK boomer” while being heckled.
Chlöe Swarbrick is an MP in the New Zealand Green party, and was just in parliament doing a speech about the Zero Carbon Bill. In extremely OK boomer energy, her speech was interrupted by a National party MP heckling her.
“The average age of this 52nd Parliament is 49 years old,” she says, holding up her hand and smiling, quickly dropping a “Ok boomer”, and then continuing. It’s a pretty good summary of the meme — a young politician battling for something important like a Zero Carbon Bill, and being extremely exasperated with the boomers impeding her.
Also, hilariously, the TV captions did not pick up the Gen Z inspired slang, an replaced it with “OK, Berma.”



Anyway, if you skip to about 1 minute in, you can watch it in all its glory.
