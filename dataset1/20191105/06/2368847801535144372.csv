大陸民眾「戴銬跳舞」避審查 陳秋實：要砸碎鐐銬

05 Nov 2019, 06:25

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】中共當局政治言論審查的力度日趨嚴重，大陸民間出現了一種「戴着鐐銬跳舞」的應對方式。曾直播香港「反送中」運動的北京律師陳秋實遭到中共官方全網封殺後，日前有粉絲在視頻中，幫陳秋實在臉部貼上表情包，再進行傳播。不過，陳秋實表示能夠理解，但應該考慮怎麼把鐐銬砸碎。
自由亞洲電台11月4日報導，曾因直播香港「反送中」運動，而陷入危機的北京律師陳秋實，遭到中共官方全網封殺，國內社交媒體帳號一律被封。然而上有政策、下有對策，有粉絲在視頻中，幫陳秋實在臉部貼上表情包後再進行傳播，以躲避人臉識別的審查。
這不是中國網友第一次創意性的應對網路監管，有新疆維吾爾人曾用抖音，發布他們在全家福照片前默默哭泣的視頻，以其內容上的模糊躲過了初步審查；也曾有人將文字制做成圖片並加上劃痕，以繞開監管部門的圖片識別技術。
對於熱心網友將視頻中的自己貼上表情包再進行傳播，陳秋實回應道：「我不會去這樣做的，我覺得挺傻的，有時候粉絲會腦洞大開想很多好玩的方式，我都能理解。但是，我不會去做。」
陳秋實說，自己不喜歡「戴着鐐銬跳舞」：「我覺得你戴着鐐銬，你不是應該思考怎麼把鐐銬砸碎嗎？」
陳秋實說：鋸斷鐐銬，而不是戴着鐐銬耍寳
陳秋實在香港直播反送中運動之後，被多個政府部門約談。他擁有74萬粉絲的微博號，157萬粉絲的抖音號，以及他的快手號、微信公眾號等通通被封。比如，他不能再用自己的手機號、名字註冊抖音，曾嘗試只錄一段視頻什麼都不說，對鏡頭招手，然而這個號也會被封。此後，陳秋實沉寂了一個多月。
9月30日那天，陳秋實呼籲大家，將社交媒體頭像改為「手持燃燒的打火機」的照片，寓意為星火燎原，為祖國建設發光發熱。10月1日，他卻被警察以「尋釁滋事」為由，帶走審訊了8小時。
即便身處全網被封、無處發聲的處境，陳秋實認為，他沒有跪下，而是以以色列特種兵的培訓作為行為宗旨：「被人拿槍指着頭，你的腿可以跪下，但你的靈魂不能跪下。你的靈魂要保持警惕，隨時把槍搶過來。但是我也知道，這樣做很危險。」
他說：「戴着鐐銬，你不是耍寳、比賽，誰戴鐐銬跳舞好看？而是看誰有本事，把鐐銬砸碎。就算砸不碎，我拿個小鑿，今天鋸一刀，明天鋸一刀，我鋸到死那天。死了以後還有後面一代代的人，總有一天會把鐐銬鋸斷的。」
據報，香港反送中運動發生後，中共嚴密封鎖網路信息，就在這種情況下，陳秋實赴香港三天，現場直播他在香港的所見所聞。
自由亞洲電台8月21日曾報導，陳秋實在香港視頻直播中，對比大陸媒體和香港媒體報導香港反送中運動的不同，被一些美國推特網友轉發。
在8月18日陳秋實從香港旺角街頭發布的另一個視頻中，陳秋實談到了他對香港街頭民主運動的看法。
在另一個視頻中，陳秋實解釋了香港反送中運動的三個關鍵詞。
8月18日，在香港維多利亞公園，再次爆發大規模反送中和平集會，集會主題為停止警黑暴力、落實林鄭月娥下台等五大訴求。集會組織者公布參加人數約為170萬人。
陳秋實在這個集會現場發布視頻談感受。
此外，近年來，中國的自由派知識份子如賀衛方、許章潤等人，連接遭到封號、打壓。此外，人臉識別、情緒識別等監控技術的推廣，也逐漸將普通民眾置於全方位的「圓形監獄」之下。
海外民間組織「改變中國」（ChinaChange.org）的創辦人曹雅學接受自由亞洲採訪時指出，中國國內的政治形勢到了一個邊緣，知識份子如向松祚，鄭也夫，許章潤等人的帶動和示範，能夠反映出時代的聲音，甚至可能引發「蝴蝶效應」。
曹雅學認為，儘管網友的創意作用是有限的，但是國內網民或者異見分子不應該停止打破言論封鎖的創新和嘗試，最好能夠實現技術上的突破，最終打破防火牆的束縛。

Mainland people ""Dai Wei dance"" to avoid censorship Chen Qiushi: To smash

05 Nov 2019, 06:25

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The CCP’s political speech review has become more and more serious, and there has been a kind of coping style in the mainland. After the Beijing lawyer Chen Qiushi, who had broadcasted the Hong Kong ""Reverse Sending"" campaign, was banned by the official website of the Chinese Communist Party, there were fans in the video to help Chen Qiu real put an expression pack on his face and spread it. However, Chen Qiushi expressed his understanding, but he should consider how to break it.
Radio Free Asia reported on November 4 that Chen Qiushi, a Beijing lawyer who had been in crisis due to the live broadcast of the ""Reverse Sending"" campaign in Hong Kong, was banned by the official website of the Chinese Communist Party. The domestic social media accounts were all blocked. However, there are policies and countermeasures. Fans in the video help Chen Qiu real to spread the expression on the face before spreading to avoid the face recognition review.
This is not the first time that Chinese netizens have responded to the Internet supervision. Some Xinjiang Uygurs used to shake their voices and released videos of their silent crying in front of the family photo. They escaped the preliminary review with the blurring of their content. Make text into pictures and add scratches to bypass the image recognition technology of the regulatory authorities.
For the enthusiastic netizens to post the emoticons in the video and then spread them, Chen Qiushi responded: ""I won't do this. I think it's silly. Sometimes fans will open their minds and think a lot of fun ways. I have I understand. But I won't do it.""
Chen Qiushi said that he doesn't like to ""dance to dance with a donkey"": ""I think you are wearing a donkey. You shouldn't think about how to break it?""
Chen Qiushi said: sawing broken shackles instead of wearing smashing treasures
Chen Qiushi was interviewed by various government departments after the live broadcast of the anti-send campaign in Hong Kong. He has a Weibo number of 740,000 fans, a vibrating number of 1.57 million fans, and his fast hand number and WeChat public number. For example, he can no longer register his vibrato with his mobile phone number and name. He tried to record only one video and said nothing to the camera. However, this number will also be blocked. Since then, Chen Qiushi has been silent for more than a month.
On September 30th, Chen Qiushi called on everyone to change the social media avatar to a photo of ""hand-held burning lighter"", which means that the fire of the fire will be built for the motherland. On October 1st, he was taken by the police for 8 hours on the grounds of ""finding troubles.""
Even if he is in a situation where the whole network is sealed and there is nowhere to speak, Chen Qiushi believes that he did not kneel down, but the training of Israeli special forces as a behavioral purpose: ""Being pointed at the gun, your legs can kneel, but Your soul can't kneel down. Your soul should be vigilant and grab the gun at any time. But I also know that it is dangerous to do so.""
He said: ""When you wear a donkey, you are not a treasure, a match, who wears a good dance, but you can see who has the ability to break it. Even if it doesn't break, I take a small chisel, saw a knife today, saw it tomorrow. One knife, I saw it on the day of death. After the death, there will be people from the next generation, and one day the saw will be cut off.""
It is reported that after the Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign, the CCP strictly sealed the network information. Under this circumstance, Chen Qiushi went to Hong Kong for three days to broadcast live and what he saw and heard in Hong Kong.
Radio Free Asia reported on August 21 that Chen Qiushi was broadcasted in Hong Kong live video, compared with the mainland media and Hong Kong media reported that the Hong Kong anti-send movement was different, and was forwarded by some US Twitter users.
In another video released by Chen Qiushi on the streets of Mong Kok, Hong Kong on August 18, Chen Qiushi talked about his views on the street democracy movement in Hong Kong.
In another video, Chen Qiushi explained three key words in the Hong Kong anti-send campaign.
On August 18th, in the Victoria Park of Hong Kong, a large-scale anti-send peace rally broke out again. The theme of the rally was to stop the police violence and implement the five major demands of Lin Zhengyue’s step down. The organizers announced that the number of participants was about 1.7 million.
Chen Qiushi posted a video chat experience at the gathering.
In addition, in recent years, Chinese liberal intellectuals such as He Weifang, Xu Zhangrun and others have been linked and suppressed. In addition, the promotion of surveillance technologies such as face recognition and emotion recognition has gradually placed ordinary people under a full-scale ""round prison.""
Cao Yaxue, the founder of overseas Chinese organization ""Change China"" (ChinaChange.org), said in an interview with Free Asia that China's domestic political situation has reached an edge, and intellectuals such as Xiang Song, Zheng Yefu, Xu Zhangrun and others have driven and demonstrated. It can reflect the voice of the times and may even trigger a ""butterfly effect.""
Cao Yaxue believes that although the creative role of netizens is limited, domestic netizens or dissidents should not stop breaking the innovation and attempt of the speech blockade. It is best to achieve technological breakthroughs and ultimately break the shackles of the firewall.
