      <p>MADISON, Ala. (AP) — An attorney representing relatives of a black man who was killed by police in Alabama is demanding full transparency over the deadly shooting.</p>
      <p>Ben Crump says he’s representing Cherelle Fletcher, who was with her daughter just a few feet away when husband Dana Fletcher was shot to death by Madison police last month.</p>
      <p>Crump says the woman is adamant that her husband wasn’t armed even though authorities say he was. Crump says authorities need to release video of the confrontation.</p>
      <p>A community gathering held Monday night about Fletcher’s slaying turned raucous as people confronted authorities over the shooting.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that Madison County Sheriff Kevin Turner told the crowd he has seen police video that clearly shows a weapon was involved before officers shot Fletcher.</p>
