無殼蝸牛運動30年　押金500住進尊爵不凡台北東區
05 Nov 2019, 06:17 by 吳妍
無殼蝸牛運動屆滿30週年，居住正義改革聯盟於昨（4日）發起「夜宿東區5天」，重回當時運動現場，以「臨誠品、雙捷運、三SOGO的尊爵不凡」「免頭期，免貸款，只要押金500元」超有哏文案號召，短短一天不到就報名額滿。
時間回到1989年，台北式的房價所得比飆到8.58倍，在1987年至1989年間，台北預售屋平均每坪房價足足漲了4倍。當時無住屋者團結組織於同年6月，發起無殼蝸牛運動，號召「萬人夜宿忠孝東路」，最終吸引5萬人響應走上街頭，也成為台灣史上第一起都市議題的社會運動。
無殼蝸牛運動邁入30週年，居住正義改革聯盟選擇重回運動現場，於4日起在忠孝復興站與忠孝敦化站之間的龍門廣場舉辦活動「夜宿東區5天」，三大訴求為：一、持續興建社會住宅，二、完成實價登錄2.0，落實房市資訊透明，三、修法課徵囤房稅，抑制不動產炒作。
由於龍門廣場部分土地屬捷運局所有，主辦單位只租借到廣場的一部分，現場擺設50個帳篷，共計250人輪流參與，整起活動資金160萬採公開募資，僅72小時就達標。

根據《中央社》報導，擔任聯盟共同發起人的黃國昌表示，低薪高房價壓迫青年，導致少子化的國安危機，他提到整起活動獲得熱烈響應，募資短短3天就達標，而募資所得的每一分錢都會用於居住正義，活動結束後會請會計師查核帳目並公開，也預告8日（本週五）他將與年輕朋友一起夜宿東區。
活動發起人之一、台灣居住正義協會理事長黃益中則呼籲年輕人，除了關心「亡國感」，也要關注居住正義，他提到台灣政治人物提到反送中就會高喊言論自由等人權，反觀一談到居住正義就噤聲，但居住正義不該是「選擇性人權」。
前台北市都市發展局長林洲民表示，2014年至2018年台北市編列828億預算做12,000戶社會住宅，但2019年就停止。他提到，荷蘭的公宅是台灣的400倍，現在台灣的居住問題是「比絕望更絕望」，痛批「不蓋公宅的政府是懶惰的政府」。

05 Nov 2019, 06:17 by Wu Hao
The 30th anniversary of the shellless snail movement, the Living Justice Reform Alliance launched ""night stay in the Eastern District for 5 days"" yesterday (4th) and returned to the sports scene at the time, ""Lincheng, Double MRT, Three SOGO's Monarchy"" ""The exemption period, free of loans, as long as the deposit is 500 yuan"" is beyond the appeal of the copy, and the registration will be less than one day.
Back in 1989, the Taipei-style house price ratio was 8.58 times. Between 1987 and 1989, the average price per house in Taipei's pre-sale houses rose by a factor of four. At that time, no housing united unity organized the shellless snail movement in June of the same year, calling for “wantang nights to loyalty to Xiaoxiao East Road”, which eventually attracted 50,000 people to take to the streets and became the first social movement in Taiwan’s history.
The 30th anniversary of the shellless snail movement, the Living Justice Reform Alliance chose to return to the sports scene. From the 4th on the Longmen Square between Zhongxiao Fuxing Station and Zhongxiao Dunhua Station, the event ""Evening in the East District for 5 days"", the three major demands are : First, continue to build social housing, second, complete the real price registration 2.0, implement the housing market transparency, third, the law to levy the housing tax, to curb real estate speculation.
Since part of the land in Longmen Square is owned by the MRT Bureau, the organizer only rents a part of the square and has 50 tents on site. A total of 250 people take turns to participate. The whole activity fund is 1.6 million yuan for public fundraising, and only 72 hours is up to standard.

According to the report of the Central News Agency, Huang Guochang, who is the co-sponsor of the alliance, said that low-paying and high-price housing oppressed the youth, leading to a national security crisis with a small number of children. He mentioned that the whole activity was enthusiastically responded, and the fundraising reached the target in just three days. Every penny raised from the fundraising will be used for residence justice. After the event, the accountant will be asked to check the accounts and make it public. It is also announced on the 8th (this Friday) that he will spend the night with the young friends.
Huang Yizhong, one of the initiators of the event and chairman of the Taiwan Resident Justice Association, appealed to young people to pay attention to the right to livelihood in addition to the sense of ""death in the country."" He mentioned that Taiwanese political figures mentioned that they would scream for freedom of speech and other human rights when they sent back. On the other hand, when it comes to living justice, it is a buzz, but living justice should not be ""selective human rights.""
Former Taipei City Urban Development Director Lin Zhoumin said that from 2014 to 2018, Taipei City budgeted 82.8 billion to make 12,000 social housing, but it stopped in 2019. He mentioned that the public house in the Netherlands is 400 times that of Taiwan. Now the problem of living in Taiwan is ""more desperate than despair"", and it is criticized that ""the government that does not cover the public house is a lazy government.""
