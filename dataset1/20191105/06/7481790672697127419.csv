　日米の株式市場で株価が上昇している。連休明け５日の東京株式市場の日経平均株価（２２５種）は４００円超値上がりして今年の最高値を更新した。同日午前のニューヨーク株式市場では、ダウ平均株価（３０種）が前日４日につけた過去最高値を一時上回る水準で取引されている。米国の経済指標が堅調なことや米中貿易協議が進展しているとの見方が広がり、投資家がリスクを取る姿勢を強めている。
　５日の日経平均はほぼ全面高の展開となった。終値は前週末比４０１円２２銭高の２万３２５１円９９銭となり、１０月２９日につけた今年の最高値を更新した。終値で２万３０００円台に乗せたのは昨年１０月１０日以来、約１年１か月ぶり。
　４日のダウ平均の終値は前週末比１１４・７５ドル高の２万７４６２・１１ドルで、約３か月半ぶりにこれまでの最高値を更新した。米労働省が１日に発表した１０月の雇用統計が市場予想を上回り、雇用の底堅さが確認されたとして、米景気の先行きに対する悲観的な見方が後退した。
　米中貿易摩擦についても、１日に行われた両国の閣僚級電話協議で、農業など一部の分野で大筋で決着したと伝わり、貿易摩擦が緩和するとの期待が高まった。
　東京市場では、米株高に加えて、東京外国為替市場の円相場が１ドル＝１０８円台後半まで円安が進んだことも好感された。電気機器や自動車といった輸出関連銘柄を中心に幅広く買い注文が入り、東証１部全体の売買代金は約３兆円に上り、活況の目安となる２兆円を上回る大商いとなった。

Stock prices are rising in the Japanese and US stock markets. The Nikkei Stock Average (225 types) of the Tokyo Stock Market on the 5th day after the consecutive holidays rose by more than 400 yen and renewed the highest price this year. In the New York stock market on the same day, the Dow average stock price (30 types) is trading at a level that temporarily exceeds the record high on the 4th of the previous day. Investors are taking more risky attitudes as the economic indicators of the US are strong and the view that US-China trade talks are advancing.
５ The Nikkei average on the 5th was almost flat. The closing price was 23,251.99 yen, an increase of 401.22 yen compared to the previous weekend, updating the highest price of this year on October 29th. It was the first time in about a year and a month since October 10 last year that the price reached the 23,000 yen range.
The closing price of the Dow average on the 4th was 27,462.11 dollars, an increase of 114.75 dollars compared to the previous weekend, and it was the highest ever since about three and a half months. The pessimistic view of the future of the US economy has receded as the October employment statistics announced by the US Department of Labor on October 1 have exceeded market expectations and the firmness of employment has been confirmed.
Regarding the US-China trade friction, the ministerial-level telephone talks between the two countries held on the 1st that it was reported that the settlement was settled in some fields such as agriculture, and expectations were raised that trade friction would ease.
In the Tokyo market, in addition to US stock appreciation, I was also impressed by the yen's depreciation in the Tokyo foreign exchange market, where the dollar depreciated to the middle of the 108 dollars. A wide range of purchase orders, mainly for export-related brands such as electrical equipment and automobiles, were made, and the trading value of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange amounted to about 3 trillion yen, exceeding the 2 trillion yen that is the benchmark for business.
