      <h1>Turkey says it has captured the sister of dead IS leader al-Baghdadi</h1>

      <p>Turkey has captured the sister of dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the northern Syrian town of Azaz, a senior Turkish official has told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Rasmiya Awad, 65, was detained in a raid near Azaz, the official said, referring to a Turkish-controlled Syrian town near the border. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children.</p>
      <p>Her husband and daughter-in-law were also arrested in the same operation, and are being interrogated.</p>
      <p>"We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of ISIS," the official said.</p>
      <p>Little independent information is available on Baghdadi's sister and Reuters was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi killed himself last month when cornered in a tunnel during a raid by US special forces in northwestern Syria.</p>
      <p>Islamic State, in an audio tape posted online on Thursday, confirmed that its leader had died and vowed revenge against the United States.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi had risen from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself "caliph" of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and Syria from 2014-2017, before Islamic State's control was wrested away by U.S.-led coalition forces including Iraqis and Syrian Kurds.</p>
      <p>The group, also known as ISIS, said a successor to Baghdadi identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi had been appointed.</p>
      <p>A senior U.S. official last week said Washington was looking at the new leader to determine where he came from.</p>
      <p>World leaders welcomed his death, but they and security experts warned that the group, which carried out atrocities against religious minorities and horrified most Muslims, remained a security threat in Syria and beyond.</p>
