      <h1>Spanish IT firm infected with ransomware in continued attacks on supply chains</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:13:12+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ravie/" target="_blank">Ravie Lakshmanan</a></address>
      <p>Two major Spanish companies, including radio company Sociedad Española de Radiodifusión (Cadena SER) and NTT-owned IT services firm Everis, have become the latest victims of a targeted ransomware attack.</p>
      <p>The attack is said to have begun in the early hours of Monday, <a href="https://www.abc.es/tecnologia/redes/abci-vuelve-miedo-wannacry-ciberataque-afecta-varias-empresas-espanolas-201911041336_noticia.html">according to Spanish daily ABC</a>. Indications are that the ransomware strain that hit Everis is a version of <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2019-072215-3220-99">BitPaymer</a>, which has been used increasingly used by attackers to <a href="http://blog.morphisec.com/bitpaymer-ransomware-with-new-custom-packer-framework">lock down compromised systems</a> on a breached network.</p>
      <p>It’s worth pointing out that this is the second time Spanish businesses have been hit by ransomware infections, the first being the notorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">WannaCry attacks of 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>As a precautionary measure, both the impacted companies have <a href="https://cadenaser.com/ser/2019/11/04/sociedad/1572862102_968725.html">shut down computers and disconnected their networks</a> from the internet.</p>
      <p>The attackers reportedly demanded Everis for a €750,000 ($835,923) ransom to get a decryption key to unlock their files, <a href="https://bitcoin.es/actualidad/mas-de-1-5-millones-de-euros-en-bitcoin-como-rescate-a-accentur-everis-y-cadena-ser/">bitcoin.es reported</a>. But there is no indication that the amount has been paid.</p>
      <p>The ransomware strain that hit Cadena SER is not yet known publicly, although the <a href="https://www.incibe.es/en">National Cybersecurity Institute</a> (INCIBE) is currently <a href="https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/nota-informativa-ransomware-empresas">assisting the radio station in restoring their encrypted data</a> and get their systems back online.</p>
      <p>The country’s <a href="https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/sala-prensa/ciberataques-ransomware-04-noviembre-2019">Department of National Security</a> (DSN) acknowledged the attack, stating the “objective is the encryption of files, which has had a widespread impact on all its computer systems.”</p>
      <p>Though not confirmed, <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2019/11/everis-spain-ransomware-attack.html">multiple reports</a> <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-hit-everis-and-spains-largest-radio-network/">suspect</a> that the attackers might have used the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/08/14/psa-update-your-windows-machine-now-to-fix-29-critical-security-vulnerabilities/">BlueKeep RDP vulnerability</a> to remotely compromise the company’s servers.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, security researchers uncovered the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/bluekeep-attacks-are-happening-but-its-not-a-worm/">first mass-hacking campaign</a> that leverages the aforementioned remote code execution flaw — for which Microsoft had issued a fix back in May — in Windows Remote Desktop Services to take over unpatched target systems and install a cryptocurrency miner.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/10/22/supply-chains-show-their-weaknesses-following-avast-and-nordvpn-attacks/">managed service providers increasingly become the target of cyber attacks</a>, it highlights the need to safeguard the digital supply chain by segmenting critical network infrastructure using firewalls and conducting periodic security audits to identify gaps and weaknesses.</p>
