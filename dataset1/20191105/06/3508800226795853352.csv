休假變多、效率變高？日本微軟跟進「週休三日」，員工生產力增40％
05 Nov 2019, 06:09 by 李秉芳


我們想讓你知道的是日本政府2017年就開始呼籲公司讓員工早點下班，現在2020東京奧運將來，日本政府希望公司在此期間讓員工選擇在家上班或調整作業時間，降低市區交通負擔。



日本微軟（Microsoft Japan）自今年8月起試辦「周休三日」，讓2300名員工每星期只工作4天，期間公司每周五就停止辦公，結果發現這項政策大幅激勵了員工的生產力，成長幅度接近40％。
《經濟日報》報導，微軟表示，業績提高的部分原因可歸功於把會議時間上限訂於30分鐘，而且增加遠距會議。與此同時，微軟日本公司也見到這段期間成本下滑，用電量減少23.1%、影印紙的用紙張數減少58.7%。
微軟日本公司指出，這項試驗還結合自我發展與家庭健身計畫，更獲得員工大量正面回饋，有92.1％的員工表示他們喜歡每周工作四日。計劃在今年冬天實施類似的工作與生活挑戰，目標是促使工作更具彈性。
《衛報》報導，作為該計劃的一部分，該公司還打算為員工的家庭度假提供補貼，最高可達10萬日圓。微軟日本公司總裁兼執行長平野卓也發表聲明說：「工作時間短，休息好，學到很多東西，我希望員工思考並體驗如何在減少20％的工作時間的情況下，實現相同的工作結果。」
不只微軟，日本企業文化改變中？
《東森新聞》報導，肯德基（KFC）日本公司已於2016年開始實施工作4天制，包括休完產假的女性員工都被納入此項制度，希望能幫助公司留住更多員工。日本國際連鎖便利商店集團全家（Family Mart）也宣布跟進，全公司5800名員工都可選擇一週工作4日，特別是需要照顧年老父母的員工。一週工作4天的員工可在工作日内增加工時，每週至少工作30小時，因此薪資與工作5天時不會差太多。日本優衣庫（Uniqulo）母公司Fast Retailing也提供一週工作4天的選擇，雅虎（Yahoo）日本也推出類似政策。
對於越來越多企業推出一週工作4天的制度，日本中央大學經濟學教授Tetsu Washitani分析，過去這種制度都是大公司才有，但日本近年人口成長減少，潛在勞動力低迷，因此需要盡可能讓更多勞動力就業，例如促進老年人和女性投入職場，原本因為要育兒或是照顧老人而離職的員工就能留任，吸引更多類型的勞動者就業，有助於減輕日本勞動力短缺的問題。
《ETtoday》報導，日本素來以全球最高工時而聞名，職場環境普遍存在過勞情況。根據2016年日本政府一項研究報告，有將近四分之一的日本公司要求員工每月加班超過80小時，英語中的Karoshi（過勞死）一詞也來源於日語。
《科技新報》報導，微軟此舉與近年日本政府的呼籲也有關，日本政府在 2017 年就呼籲企業在星期五讓員工早點下班。而如今東京奧運即將來臨，政府希望日本公司在此期間讓員工選擇在家上班或調整作業時間，以降低市區的交通負擔，這樣的企業改革可說是對整個社會有相當大的正面幫助。
紐西蘭、歐洲，連台灣都有週休三日
《經濟日報》報導，每周工作四天的做法愈來愈受到歡迎，倡導人士強調這有助於減輕壓力與防止過勞。一家紐西蘭公司在2018年宣稱兩個月試驗每周工作四日的計畫，成功促進員工的工作與生活平衡，《風傳媒》報導，紐西蘭信託公司Perpetual Guardian進行「週休三日」的實驗，200多名員工都參與。公司高層曾擔心：「大家都習慣了一週工作五天」怕影響生產力；員工也猶豫自己是否能在四天內完成五天的工作量。但結果發現，工作不但能夠如期完成，工作壓力也減少許多。
實驗期間內，公司維持了相同的營收，但支出卻降低了，員工們的通勤時間減少，連帶公司也省下了水電。就結果來看對公司和員工是雙贏的局面，員工不但提升了工作效率，也能有更多的時間精進自己，公司還打算把這項實驗永久進行下去。
《自由時報》報導，德國勞工的年假受《聯邦休假法》保障，如果德國人在每週需工作6天的企業上班，最低可享24天年假；如果每週工作5天，則有20天年假；每週工作4天，也有16天年假。上述只是國家設定的最低門檻，德國企業通常都會提供比這些標準更優渥的福利，一年有30天年假非常常見。此外，德國另有15天的國定假日，全國放假的國定假日則有9天。
台灣也有週休三日的公司為「圓神出版社」，《自由時報》報導，圓神出版社早在2013年3月便開始實施週休三日，且福利沒有縮水，旅遊補助、各項活動等福利俱全，年薪保障14個月，每年穩定調薪。對於外界質疑是否會變成變相加班？這間公司的員工說，其實只要自己安排得宜，不但不會影響到休息時間，一週還有多一天的彈性時間，能自由安排休閒活動，可以多和家人相處或培養興趣，既兼顧工作又能增加自己的私人時間。

More vacations and higher efficiency? Japan's Microsoft followed up ""three days off"", employee productivity increased by 40%
05 Nov 2019, 06:09 by Li Bingfang


What we want you to know is that the Japanese government has called on the company to let employees get off work in 2017. Now, in the future of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Japanese government hopes that the company will allow employees to choose to work at home or adjust their working hours during this period to reduce the burden of urban traffic.



Microsoft Japan has been testing ""three days off"" since August this year, allowing 2,300 employees to work only four days a week. The company stopped working every Friday and found that this policy greatly motivated employees. Productivity, the growth rate is close to 40%.
""Economic Daily"" reported that Microsoft said that part of the reason for the improvement in performance can be attributed to setting the meeting time limit to 30 minutes and increasing the distance meeting. At the same time, Microsoft Japan also saw a decline in costs during this period, the electricity consumption decreased by 23.1%, and the number of papers for photocopying paper decreased by 58.7%.
Microsoft Japan pointed out that the trial also combined self-development and family fitness programs, and received a lot of positive feedback from employees. 92.1% of employees said they like to work four days a week. Similar work and life challenges are planned for this winter, with the goal of making work more resilient.
The Guardian reported that as part of the plan, the company also plans to subsidize employees' family vacations up to 100,000 yen. Microsoft Japan’s President and CEO Hirano Hiroshi also issued a statement saying: “Working time is short, rest is good, and a lot of things are learned. I want employees to think and experience how to achieve the same work results with 20% reduction in working hours. ""
Not only Microsoft, the Japanese corporate culture is changing?
""East Sen News"" reported that KFC Japan has started to implement a four-day work in 2016, including female employees who have taken maternity leave to be included in the system, hoping to help the company retain more employees. The family of Japan's international chain convenience store group (Family Mart) also announced follow-up. The 5,800 employees of the company can choose to work for 4 days a week, especially those who need to take care of their elderly parents. Employees who work for 4 days a week can increase working hours during the working day and work at least 30 hours a week, so the salary and work are not much worse than 5 days. Japan's Uniqulo parent company Fast Retailing also offers a four-day week of work, and Yahoo Japan has introduced similar policies.
For more and more companies to launch a four-day week-long system, Tetsu Washitani, a professor of economics at the Central University of Japan, analyzed that in the past, such systems were owned by large companies, but Japan’s population growth has declined in recent years, and the potential labor force is low. Let more labor force employment, such as promoting the elderly and women into the workplace, employees who originally left because of childcare or caring for the elderly can stay in office and attract more types of workers to work, which will help alleviate the shortage of labor in Japan.
According to ETtoday, Japan has always been known for its highest working hours in the world, and there is widespread overwork in the workplace. According to a 2016 study by the Japanese government, nearly one-quarter of Japanese companies require employees to work over 80 hours a month. The word Karoshi in English is also derived from Japanese.
The Science and Technology News reported that Microsoft's move is also related to the appeal of the Japanese government in recent years. In 2017, the Japanese government called on companies to let employees get off work early on Friday. Now that the Tokyo Olympics is coming, the government hopes that Japanese companies will choose to work at home or adjust their working hours to reduce the traffic burden in the city. This kind of enterprise reform can be said to have a considerable positive help to the whole society.
New Zealand, Europe, and even Taiwan have three days off
The Economic Daily reported that the practice of working four days a week is becoming more and more popular, and advocates emphasize that this will help reduce stress and prevent overwork. A New Zealand company announced in 2018 that it plans to work four days a week for a two-month trial to successfully promote the work-life balance of its employees. Wind Media reported that New Zealand trust company Perpetual Guardian has ""three days off"". The experiment, more than 200 employees are involved. The company’s top executives once worried: “Everyone is used to working for five days a week” and is afraid of affecting productivity; employees are hesitant to see if they can complete five days of work in four days. However, it was found that the work was not only completed on schedule, but also the work pressure was reduced.
During the experiment period, the company maintained the same revenue, but the expenditure was reduced, the commute time of the employees was reduced, and the company also saved water and electricity. As far as the results are concerned, the company and the employees are in a win-win situation. The employees not only improve their work efficiency, but also have more time to improve themselves. The company also intends to carry out this experiment forever.
The Free Times reported that the annual leave of German workers is guaranteed by the Federal Leave Act. If the Germans work in a company that works 6 days a week, they can enjoy a minimum of 24 days of annual leave; if they work 5 days a week, there are 20 days. Annual leave; 4 days a week, 16 days of annual leave. These are just the minimum thresholds set by the state. German companies usually offer better benefits than these standards. 30 days of annual leave a year is very common. In addition, Germany has another 15 days of national holidays, and national holidays for national holidays are 9 days.
In Taiwan, there is also a company that has a three-day break for the ""God of the Gods Publishing House"". The ""Free Times"" reported that the Yuanshen Publishing House began to implement a three-day break as early as March 2013, and the welfare has not shrunk, tourism subsidies, various activities, etc. The welfare is comprehensive, the annual salary is guaranteed for 14 months, and the salary is stable every year. Questioning whether the outside world will become disguised overtime? The employees of this company said that in fact, as long as they are properly arranged, they will not only affect the rest time, but also have more flexibility in the week. They can freely arrange leisure activities, and can get along with their families or cultivate interest. Increase your private time.
