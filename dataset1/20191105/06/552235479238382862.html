      <h1>Liam Polworth transfer chase with Portsmouth keen on in-form Motherwell star</h1>
      <h2>The 25-year-old has been a major player in the Steelmen’s rise to third spot in the Premiership.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Portsmouth are on the trail of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> star Liam Polworth.</p>
      <p>The English League One outfit have been scouting the in-form midfielder.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been a major player in the Steelmen’s rise to third spot in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a>.</p>
      <p>Polworth has now come on to the radar of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/portsmouth-fc">Portsmouth</a> boss Kenny Jackett, who already has Rangers star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-mccrorie">Ross McCrorie</a> on loan, and his scouting team will run the rule over the playmaker over the coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Well boss Stephen Robinson wants his players to follow Liverpool and Manchester City’s lead to break teams down.</p>
      <p>The Fir Park outfit secured their second 2-1 win in a row when Allan Campbell’s late strike helped them to overcome Livingston and remain in third place.</p>
      <p>Campbell’s run into the penalty area was rewarded when the ball broke to him and he slotted it home to seal the win.</p>
      <p>And Robinson insists it is important to have willing runners who will go in front of the players in order to break down teams that sit in.</p>

      <p>Robinson said: “Both games in the last few days we’ve said, ‘You’re going to have to be patient’.</p>
      <p>“Teams know what sort of pace we’ve got and they sit in.</p>
      <p>“If you look at Liverpool and Manchester City all their players have all got legs and want to run beyond the ball.</p>
      <p>“It’s important everyone doesn’t come to the ball at times.”</p>
