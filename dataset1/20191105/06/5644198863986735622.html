      <p>SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon on Thursday reported that quarterly profits shy of Wall Street forecasts, sending shares of the tech giant tumbling in after-market trades.</p>
      <p>Net income slid 27 percent from last year to $2.1 billion, with profits pressured by Amazon's spending to speed up most deliveries to one day.</p>

      <p>Revenue climbed 24 percent to $70 billion in the quarter to September 30, compared to the $56.6 billion in sales logged in the same period a year earlier, according to the Seattle-based company.</p>
      <p>Amazon shares were down nearly seven percent in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings figures.</p>
      <p>Cost of sales at Amazon leapt about 33 percent , eating into net income, according to the earnings report.</p>
      <p>Amazon has been pushing to deliver packages more quickly, promising a wide selection of items to arrive within a day of being ordered by members of its Prime subscription service.</p>
      <p>"We are ramping up to make our 25th holiday season the best ever for Prime customers -- with millions of products available for free one-day delivery,? said Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos in the earnings release.</p>
      <p>"Customers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day -- they've already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It's a big investment, and it's the right long-term decision for customers."</p>
      <p>Amazon has also positioned itself for the year-end holiday shopping season with a freshened lineup of Alexa-powered products on extending from homes and cars to wearable devices, and a celebrity voice option for the popular digital assistant.</p>
      <p>Amazon, one of the world's most valuable companies, has expanded from its origins in e-commerce to cloud services, streaming media, artificial intelligence and brick-and-mortar grocery stores, with its own lineup of consumer electronics.</p>
      <p>- 'Mixed bag' -</p>
      <p>Analyst Andrew Lipsman at the research firm eMarketer called the quarterly results "a very mixed bag for Amazon with a couple shining bright spots but also some clouds looming in the cloud business."</p>
      <p>Lipsman said the cloud computing unit AWS is seeing "softening in growth rates" which he said "will weigh on the company's profits if they can?t reverse the trend."</p>
      <p>The analyst said Amazon's advertising and e-commerce operations "look very strong as investments in next-day shipping, though eating into the bottom line in the near term, are paying fast dividends on the top line."</p>
      <p>In a product launch last month in Seattle, Washington, Alexa was the star as Amazon sought to widen the reach of its digital assistant powered by artificial intelligence amid a battle with rivals from Google, Apple, Microsoft and others.</p>
      <p>Along with beefing up the Echo and Ring lines, Amazon introduced earbuds it touted as providing the first wearable, hands-free Alexa experience on the go.</p>
      <p>The Amazon voice assistant was also infused prototype eyeglass frames on display at the media event along with an enhanced array of Echo smart speakers.</p>
