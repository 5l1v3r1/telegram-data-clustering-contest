'The end of smear tests' and 'new voice' of the Commons
05 Nov 2019, 06:08 by BBC News


""The end of smear testing,"" heralds the Daily Mirror, also reporting on the new at-home urine check, which it says could ""revolutionise"" cervical cancer screening. Scientists hope it will lead to more women getting screened, the paper adds, after numbers fell to their lowest level since 1997.



The report on the alternative cervical cancer testing kits also features on the front of the Times. But the paper's lead story is on think-tank the Centre for Policy Studies, which analysed Labour's pledge to cut the average UK working week to 32 hours, or four days, within 10 years of a Labour government. According to the analysis, reducing hours in this way would cost taxpayers £17bn, because of the projected rise in the public sector wage bill.



The i newspaper also leads with a health story, reporting that scientists have been brought ""fresh hope of finding a cure"" to Alzheimer's disease. The paper tells the story of a woman from Colombia who has a rare genetic mutation which causes early onset Alzheimer's disease - but her symptoms were kept at bay for three decades. Researchers think it could be due to another rare gene found in her body and, if that is true, it has the potential to be used in the development of a treatment.



A photo of Labour MP Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who was elected the next House of Commons Speaker on Monday night, makes the front of several papers, including the Financial Times. But the paper's main story is on the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. The group is expected to announce ""tougher governance standards"" as part of a bid to ""restore confidence"" in its investments, the paper reports.



A picture of Sir Lindsay Hoyle being dragged to the Speaker's chair, as per parliamentary tradition, features on the front page of the Guardian. But the paper leads on another parliamentary story - a report from the Commons intelligence and security committee examining the threat posed by Russia meddling to UK politics. The report, finished in March 2019, has not yet been published. The Guardian says No 10 has indicated it will not allow it to be published before the election, a decision that committee chairman Dominic Grieve has called ""jaw-dropping"".



The Daily Telegraph reports on how the ongoing dispute between postal workers and the Royal Mail could impact the election. The Communication Workers Union has said the planned strike action over job security and employment terms and conditions ""would, of course, mean refusing to deliver postal votes and campaign leaflets"". According to the paper, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom suggests the industrial action was timed to boost Labour's chances but the CWU denies this.



Meanwhile, the Daily Express leads on comments by Boris Johnson who has asked Jeremy Corbyn to clarify Labour's position on Brexit. The PM has written a letter to Mr Corbyn, saying voters ""deserve to have a clear picture"" of each party's Brexit plan. Labour has previously said its plan is to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another referendum.



The Metro leads with the news that the boss of McDonald's, Steve Easterbrook, has been fired after having a relationship with an employee. The paper reports that shares in the fast food giant fell to a six-month low after the Briton was sacked. The person he had a relationship has not been named, but Mr Easterbrook is pictured alongside Ronald McDonald.



The Sun's front page story focuses on comments from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents which has urged people not to play with fireworks. It comes after a 25-second video posted on Twitter showed someone - whom the paper dubs a ""bonfire idiot"" - launching a firework from his bottom. ""The bum powder clot,"" the paper adds in a sub-headline.



The Daily Star reports that TV producers in Germany ""drafted in a crack team"" of 50 British comedy writers and actors to help create a prime-time show because they were unable to come up with a ""funny formula"" themselves. Now the German TV bosses say they hope they will be able to sell the finished product, filmed in the English language, around the world - including in the UK.


""The end of smear testing"", declares the front page headline in the Daily Mirror which speaks of a ""game-changing advance"" in screening for cervical cancer.

The Daily Mail, which also leads on the story, says a simple urine test could allow women to test themselves for the disease in the privacy and comfort of their home, avoiding the ordeal of going to the doctors.
The Mail says the findings are crucial because cervical cancer screening rates have plunged to a 21-year low, with just seven in 10 women going for tests.
Meanwhile, the new Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is pictured on many front pages, including the Guardian, which says he's promising to fulfil the role with ""humour and quiet words"".


Sir Lindsay Hoyle was elected Speaker on MondayPA Media

The Financial Times draws a contrast with what it calls his predecessor John Bercow's ""combative manner and antiquated oratory"".
It says Sir Lindsay's election is likely to mark a return to a less flashy style.
The Sun points out that it took five hours to choose Mr Bercow's successor, leading the Guardian to complain that this House of Commons can even make a meal out of something so simple as the Speaker vote.
Quentin Letts in the Times says the voting was absurd: ""glacial waits between each knockout round for new ballot papers to be printed, quite possibly by William Caxton on wooden blocks"".
""Booze-up-in-a-brewery syndrome"", Quentin Letts adds. ""The cockpit of our elected politics incapable of running a slick secret ballot.""
When the winner emerged, the Daily Mail's Henry Deedes says Sir Lindsay Hoyle's face was that of an honest farmer whose prize pig had just been judged Best in Show.

The Times leads on analysis claiming that Labour's aim to introduce a four-day working week would cost the taxpayer at least £17bn pounds a year because of the impact on the public sector wage bill.
It says research by think-tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, has found that reducing the hours of public sector employees, including doctors, teachers and police officers, would impose a significant burden on the Treasury because the workforce would have to expand.
A Labour spokeswoman tells the Times that the move to a 32-hour week would take place over a decade and would be funded by rising productivity.
The Guardian says Boris Johnson's opponents have accused him of a cover-up after No 10 refused to publish before the election what the paper describes as a ""potentially incendiary report"" on Russian infiltration of British politics, including the Conservative Party.
A day after the Brexit Party unveiled its election candidates, the Daily Telegraph's Matt cartoon shows a voter shutting the door in the face of one of them.
She tells him: ""if you're from the Brexit Party, show me what leaving properly looks like"".
Several papers, including the Daily Express, raise the prospect of the general election being hit by a postal strike in the run-up to polling day.
According to the Telegraph, the Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has accused the Communication Workers Union of making a ""politically calculated"" threat to wreck the election by refusing to deliver millions of postal votes as part of a dispute about pay and bonuses.

The Guardian's reporter in Delhi, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, describes how thousands of women gathered in the waters of the city's Yamuna river yesterday to mark an ancient Hindu festival on the most polluted day in the Indian capital for three years.
It was, she says, a ceremony meant to bring good health and prosperity.
But instead the women had to immerse themselves in a putrid bubble bath of toxic waste while inhaling air thick with smog.

The Daily Telegraph says the race is now on to protect thousands of staff and former employees from cuts to their pensions.
Sarah Vine in the Mail says that as a ""reliable port in the storm of early motherhood"" the retailer has a place in all our hearts - all the more tragic, she says, that the management have succeeded in destroying it to such an extent.
