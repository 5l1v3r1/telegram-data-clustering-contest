社讑: 佐科威总统的愿景和抱负 

05 Nov 2019, 02:04

佐科威总统宣誓就任2019年至2024年总统后发表的第一次演讲，阐明他对未来五年，特别是经济领域的愿景和抱负。但许多人感到遗憾的是，总统没有提供关于政治、安全和国防、执法和人权领域以及打击腐败等政策的观点。 总统在人民协商会议（MPR）议员和国宾面前表达了他的梦想，即在2045年，也就是印度尼西亚独立一百周年之际，已经发展成为一个人均收入3.2亿盾，或人均月收入约2700万盾的发达国家。 总统强调：“我们的梦想是到2045年，印尼的国内生产总值达到7兆美元。印尼贫困率接近零巴仙，已经列入世界前五大经济体。我们应朝着这个方向走。我们经过仔细演算，这个目标非常合理，是很有可能实现的。然而它们不是天上掉下来的，它们来之不易，非经过艰苦奋斗不可，因此我们必须快速和富有成效地工作。” 他续称，提高生产力将成为优先事项，这是巨大的挑战，同时也是一个巨大的机遇。如果我们不能提供就业机会，将成为一个大问题。但是，如果我们能够提供卓越的人力资源，那将是一个巨大的机遇。 在有利的政治和经济生态系统的支持下，在未来五年里，佐科威将优先处理以下事项：首先，人力资源开发将是我们的重中之重，培养勤奋和有活力、技术娴熟和掌握科学知识的人才。 邀请全球人才与我们合作，也不能用老办法来实现，必须开发新办法。我们需要大量的捐赠基金来进行人力资源管理。与工业界的合作也需要优化，使用技术方能轻易达致全国各个角落。 第二，我们将继续发展将生产区与集散区连接起来的基础设施，方便前往旅游区，从而增加新的就业机会，并加快发展人民经济。第三，必须简化和尽量减少各种形式的监管约束。政府将邀请国会颁布两项主要法令：一，创造就业机会法；二，发挥中小微企业潜力法。 上述法令中的每一项都将成为综合性法律，意即一项法令同时修订好几项法令，甚至数十项妨碍创造就业机会和中小微企业发展的法令都被一举修订。 第四，继续大规模精简官僚机构，必须优先考虑在创造就业方面的投资、缩短冗长的程序和精简繁琐的官僚机构。梯队化也必须简化。第一梯队、第二梯队、第三梯队、第四梯队，不嫌多吗？总统说：“我要求简化为两个级别，取而代之的是重视专业知识、重视能力的职能岗位。”第五，经济转型。我们必须从依赖自然资源转变为对国家繁荣具有高附加值的现代制造业和服务业的竞争力，以实现印度尼西亚全体人民的社会正义。 这些政策有助于佐科威实现其发展目标。但遗憾的是，没有提到执法、人权、加强民主和打击腐败的问题。尽管我们知道在这些领域有太多的问题，这些问题困扰着人们，甚至让人们付出生命的代价，因此必须必须推行新的、更好的政策。 在这方面，我们应该强调印尼科学研究所（LIPI）政治研究中心主任菲尔曼（Firman Noor）的意见，他评估佐科威总统就职典礼上的演说，认为体现政府引领新秩序时代风格的发展方向。如Tempo杂志所引述，菲尔曼说：“我领会到似乎更注重发展问题、效率问题以及与人力资源相关的问题，类似苏哈多政府时代。” 对佐科威的演讲，菲尔曼感到遗憾的是没有关注法律、人权、民主和反腐败问题。尽管这四件事是主要的问题，与班察西拉和人道有关。在这四个问题上我国还有很多功课要做。这位印尼大学（UI）社会和政治学院的研究生讲师说：“在这种情况下，我认为总统不是很敏感，实是一件令人感到遗憾的事情。”

Community: President Zocor’s vision and ambition

05 Nov 2019, 02:04

President Zocco was sworn in as the first speech after the president of 2019-2024 to clarify his vision and ambitions for the next five years, especially in the economic field. But many regret that the president did not provide ideas on politics, security and defence, law enforcement and human rights, and policies to combat corruption. The President expressed his dream in front of the People’s Consultative Conference (MPR) members and state guests that in 2045, the 100th anniversary of Indonesia’s independence, it has grown to a per capita income of 320 million rupiah, or a per capita monthly income of about 27 million. Shield developed countries. The president stressed: ""Our dream is that by 2045, Indonesia's GDP will reach 7 trillion US dollars. Indonesia's poverty rate is close to zero, and it has been listed in the world's top five economies. We should go in this direction. We go through Careful calculations, this goal is very reasonable, it is very possible to achieve. However, they are not falling from the sky, they are hard to come by, not hard work, so we must work quickly and productively."" He continued to improve Productivity will be a priority, and this is a huge challenge and a huge opportunity. If we can't provide employment opportunities, it will become a big problem. However, if we can provide excellent human resources, it will be a huge opportunity. With the support of a favorable political and economic ecosystem, in the next five years, Zocco will give priority to the following matters: First, human resource development will be our top priority, fostering diligence and vitality, skilled and Talents with scientific knowledge. Inviting global talents to cooperate with us, we can't use old methods to achieve them, we must develop new methods. We need a lot of endowment funds to manage human resources. Cooperation with industry also needs to be optimized, and technology can easily reach all corners of the country. Second, we will continue to develop the infrastructure that connects the production area with the distribution area, and facilitate access to the tourist area, thereby increasing new employment opportunities and accelerating the development of the people's economy. Third, various forms of regulatory constraints must be simplified and minimized. The government will invite Congress to enact two major decrees: First, the Employment Opportunity Law; Second, the SMEs' Potential Law. Each of the above-mentioned decrees will become a comprehensive law, meaning that a decree amends several decrees at the same time, and even dozens of decrees that hinder job creation and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises are revised. Fourth, to continue to streamline bureaucracy on a large scale, priority must be given to investing in job creation, shortening lengthy procedures, and streamlining bureaucracies. Echelonization must also be simplified. Is the first echelon, the second echelon, the third echelon, and the fourth echelon not too much? The president said: ""I want to be reduced to two levels, replaced by functional positions that emphasize professional knowledge and ability."" Fifth, economic transformation. We must transform ourselves from relying on natural resources to the competitiveness of modern manufacturing and service industries that have a high added value to the prosperity of the country in order to achieve the social justice of all the people of Indonesia. These policies help Zicovi achieve its development goals. Regrettably, there is no mention of law enforcement, human rights, strengthening democracy and combating corruption. Although we know that there are too many problems in these areas that plague people and even make people pay the price of their lives, they must implement new and better policies. In this regard, we should emphasize the opinion of Firman Noor, director of the Center for Political Studies of the Institute of Scientific Research in Indonesia (LIPI), who evaluates the speech at the inauguration ceremony of President Zocco, arguing that the government is leading the way in the new order era. direction. As quoted by Tempo magazine, Philman said: ""I understand that it seems to focus more on development issues, efficiency issues, and human resource-related issues, similar to the Suharto government era."" For the speech of Zokovwei, Philman felt Regrettably, there is no concern about law, human rights, democracy and anti-corruption issues. Although these four things are the main issues, they are related to Bancha Syrah and humanity. There are still a lot of homework to do on these four issues. The graduate lecturer at the University of Indonesia (UI) School of Social and Political Science said: ""In this case, I think the president is not very sensitive, it is a regrettable thing.""
