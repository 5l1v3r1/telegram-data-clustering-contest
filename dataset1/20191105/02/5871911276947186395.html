      <h1>Stephen Strasburg snubs President Donald Trump on handshake at White House (Video)</h1>

      <p>POTUS wanted some dap, but the 2019 World Series MVP just wasn’t interested in giving him any.</p>
      <p>The Nationals players made the trip to the White House — roughly three miles from their home stadium, that is — to celebrate beating the Astros in the World Series, and bringing a baseball title to DC for the first time in 86 years.</p>
      <p>Most players attended, although set-up man/closer Sean Doolittle did not. Catcher Kurt Suzuki had a blast, and even <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/04/kurt-suzuki-dons-maga-hat-shares-a-moment-with-donald-trump-at-white-house-visit-video/">donned a MAGA hat</a> at one point while standing in front of the podium.</p>
      <p>As for World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg, well, when President Donald Trump attempted to shake his hand, the Nationals pitcher just turned away, snubbing him.</p>
