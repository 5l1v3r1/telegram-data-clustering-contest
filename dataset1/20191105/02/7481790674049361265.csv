　一方、連休明け５日の東京株式市場は買い注文が先行し、日経平均株価（２２５種）は一時４００円超値上がりし、今年の取引時間中の最高値を更新した。株価は午後１時現在、前週末終値比４７３円４３銭高の２万３３２４円２０銭で取引されている。
　前日のニューヨーク株式市場でダウ平均株価が大幅に上昇した流れを引き継いだ。外国為替市場の円相場が１ドル＝１０８円台後半と円安に進んだこともあり、自動車や電気機器といった輸出関連銘柄を中心に幅広く買い注文が入っている。
　ただ、「手持ちの株をいったん売って利益を確定する動きも出やすく、上値は重くなりそうだ」（大手証券）との見方もある。

Nikkei average, 473 yen appreciation at 1 pm ... This year's highest price update

05 Nov 2019, 02:48



Taken by Kenichi Matsuda, the Nikkei Stock Average (in the morning of 5th in Chuo-ku, Tokyo), which was raised by over 300 yen at a time and was in the 23,000 yen range

On the other hand, the Tokyo Stock Market on the 5th day after consecutive holidays was preceded by buying orders, and the Nikkei Stock Average (225 types) temporarily increased by over 400 yen, updating the highest price during this year's trading hours. The stock price is traded at 23.324.20 yen, which is 473.43 yen higher than the closing price of the previous weekend as of 1 pm.
The previous day's New York stock market took over the trend that the Dow average share price increased significantly. The yen has depreciated in the foreign exchange market, with the dollar depreciating to the lower 108 yen range, and there are a wide range of purchase orders centered on export-related issues such as automobiles and electrical equipment.
However, there is also a view that “It is easy to make a profit by selling your stock once and the upside is likely to become heavy” (major securities).
