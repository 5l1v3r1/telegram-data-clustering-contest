Two people suspected of stealing from vehicles parked in the area around Regina’s General Hospital have been charged.
Police reported Monday that the pair, a 31-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man, were picked up after what a media release described as “a lengthy investigation” following the recovery of several pieces of allegedly stolen property.
Officers reportedly found the stolen goods after raiding a home on the 1300 block of Victoria Avenue on Oct. 24. Several items recovered from the home matched reports filed in at least a dozen instances dating back to July where vehicles were broken into.
Police said the thefts generally involved the front windows of vehicles being smashed, with property removed from inside. Some of the stolen items were then allegedly sold at pawn shops, with the suspects posing as legitimate owners.
The investigation is continuing, but so far both suspects are facing several counts each of fraud under $5,000, possession of property obtained by crime and trafficking in property obtained by crime.
The woman charged in connection with the case is also facing two counts of theft under $5,000.
Both suspects are due to appear in Regina Provincial Court on Dec. 12.
