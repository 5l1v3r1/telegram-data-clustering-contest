""It is alleged that, contrary to Rule E3(1), the Leeds United goalkeeper used abusive and/or insulting words towards a Charlton Athletic player during an EFL Championship fixture on 28 September 2019,"" the FA said in a statement http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/nov/04/kiko-casilla-charged-041119.
""It is further alleged that the words constitute an 'aggravated breach'... as they made reference to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin.""
Leko, 20, was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo but has played for England's youth teams, making his debut for the Under-20s in September.
The FA said Spaniard Casilla has until Nov. 12 to respond and Leeds released a statement later on Monday to acknowledge the charge.
""Kiko strenuously denies the allegation and has proactively worked with the FA during their investigation to date,"" the second-tier club said in a statement https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/25747/club-statement-kiko-casilla.
""The next step of this process will be a personal hearing, in the meantime Kiko will remain available for selection.""
