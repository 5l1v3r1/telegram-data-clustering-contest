      <p><a href="https://politics.slashdot.org/~TeklaPerry">Tekla Perry</a> writes: <i>Michael Kratsios, the fourth U.S. Chief Technology Officer, explains administration policies at the Fall Conference of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence -- <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/robotics/artificial-intelligence/trump-cto-addresses-ai-facial-recognition-immigration-tech-infrastructure-and-more">and takes some tough questions from the audience</a>.</i> An exchange between Kratsios and Stanford's Eileen Donahoe hit on current hot topics, starting with the tension between the U.S. and China:<i> <b>Donahoe</b>: "You talk a lot about unique U.S. ecosystem. In which aspect of AI is the U.S. dominant, and where is China challenging us in dominance?<br/><b>Kratsios</b>: "They are challenging us on machine vision. They have more data to work with, given that they have surveillance data."<br/><b>Donahoe</b>: "To what extent would you say the quantity of data collected and available will be a determining factor in AI dominance?"<br/><b>Kratsios</b>: "It makes a big difference in the short term. But we do research on how we get over these data humps. There is a future where you don't need as much data, a lot of federal grants are going to [research in] how you can train models using less data."<br/><br/>Donahoe turned the conversation to a different tension -- that between innovation and values.<br/><br/><b>Donahoe</b>: "A lot of conversation yesterday was about the tension between innovation and values, and how do you hold those things together and lead in both realms."<br/><b>Kratsios</b>: "We recognized that the U.S. hadn't signed on to principles around developing AI. In May, we signed [the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Principles on Artificial Intelligence], coming together with other Western democracies to say that these are values that we hold dear.<br/>[Meanwhile,] we have adversaries around the world using AI to surveil people, to suppress human rights. That is why American leadership is so critical: We want to come out with the next great product. And we want our values to underpin the use cases."<br/><br/>A member of the audience pushed further:<br/><br/>"Maintaining U.S. leadership in AI might have costs in terms of individuals and society. What costs should individuals and society bear to maintain leadership?" <b>Kratsios</b>: "I don't view the world that way. Our companies big and small do not hesitate to talk about the values that underpin their technology. [That is] markedly different from the way our adversaries think. The alternatives are so dire [that we] need to push efforts to bake the values that we hold dear into this technology."</i></p>
