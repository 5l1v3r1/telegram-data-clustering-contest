The 16th Cultural Entertainment Conference, the 14th Table Tennis Friendship Competition and the 11th Youth Forum will be held on October 15-16 this year. On the 16th, from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm, the Fuqing Society General Meeting was held. On the evening of the 15th, a welcome dinner was held. More than a thousand guests from 28 Fuqing Association folks and Chinese community members came to the site to have a wonderful time together and enjoyed the song and dance programs arranged by the organizers. At the dinner, the Fuqing Tongxiang Foundation presented He Yu to the permanent honorary chairman of the year of the dynasty, Huang Jiyan, to show his respect and congratulations on his participation in the track and field competition in Brunei on August 17-19 this year. He won four championships in the senior group. The light of Fuqing. At 9 o'clock on the morning of the 16th, the Indonesian Fuqing Society General Assembly held the second expiration summary and the first session of the third session in the Arya Duta conference hall. Zhuang Junqin was selected as the chairman of the third Fuqing Association and Lin Wanjin as the chairman of the Fu, and then the old-aged group was handed over after the seal ceremony. Another 11th Youth Forum was held at the H.IBIS Auditorium in Holland Street, Bandung. 55 people were from Malang, Bayoumas, Jasmine, Kediri, Yogyakarta, Buredal, Jakarta, Bogor, Sujia Wumei, Zhanyu, Douwang, Palembang, Semarang, Magrang, Machen, Sharadia, Malibaban, Surabaya, Thoreau, 20 Fuqing Youth Group participated in the forum . The forum was hosted by Zheng Shengyu. First of all, they introduce themselves to each other and give each other souvenirs. Then they each talk about the plans that are currently being or are being prepared, and also the problems or challenges they face. Among them are the free Chinese language tutoring classes in Surabaya, Bayumas have organized the summer camp for winter camps/winter camps, the Maliba class has organized a weekly silver party gathering, and Douwang has organized welfare charity activities to help disadvantaged groups and help School-age children (anak asuh) and Jakarta youth began to gather together with the same hobbies. Now they have formed a weekly gathering, Ma Chen often holds basketball games and silver medals, and young people have entertainment programs. The problem facing small cities is that young people who leave their hometowns to study, work or start a business in a large foreign city are therefore difficult to form the Fuqing Youth Group. At present, many Fuqing youths are willing to meet together in order to hope to find a partner. Although many Fuqing youths in many cities have not been able to form a youth group because of their small number of people, they often participate in silver party gatherings held by seniors. Finally, I hope that the children of Fuqing can work hard to learn Chinese and Fuqing, and they can communicate more smoothly, build friendships and activities together. At 7 o'clock on the evening of the 16th, it was the 16th Civic Entertainment Conference. Various entertainment programs will be performed by Fuqing Tongxiang Association. The performers of each show are very serious. In particular, all kinds of dances, dances, dances, and colorful dance dresses are very eye-catching. Let the viewers appreciate it and make it happy. The two-day forum and the ping-pong friendly match were mainly held in order to enable the Fuqing folks or their descendants to gather and exchange in a positive way so that each other can know, understand and pave the way for further exchanges in the future. . Let the Fuqing fellowships have a younger generation to take over, the small inherits the cultural connotation of Fuqing, and the greater the inheritance of Chinese culture. Carry forward the Guangfu Fuqing Association, so that the unity spirit of Fuqing folks will be passed down from generation to generation. (grass feed)
