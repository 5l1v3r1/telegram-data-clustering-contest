Golden October, the autumn wind is cool. On the morning of October 17, an eight-member Anxi Welfare Foundation of Indonesia was led by Liao Yangzong from Singapore to Johor, Johor, Malaysia, and visited the Anxi Association of Johor, and was met by President Zheng Wenfa, Summer Council President Yu Yunshan, General Affairs Wang Hetai and Consultant Yao Qiwen. Waiting for the warm hospitality of many directors. Zheng Wenfa gave a speech to welcome the folks of the Anxi Association of Indonesia to visit and exchange, and mentioned that the villagers should hold the spirit of “Anxi family” and often go to each other. Liao Yangzong addressed the warm reception of the Anxi Association of Johor, and mentioned that the Anxi Association of Indonesia was re-elected this year. I hope that several successors will know more about the feelings of the local folks. At the exchange meeting, Wang Hetai elaborated on the brief history and annual activities of the Anxi Association of Johor, and then the guests and his entourage visited the Penglai Hall Qingshui Temple. At noon on the 17th, an eight-member Anxi Association resigned from the Anxi Association of Johor, and continued to travel to Malacca to meet the Malacca Anxi Guild and was warmly received by the presidents Li Hujin and General Affairs Wang Jinshui. The two sides exchanged cordial friendships. After that, I went to Kuala Lumpur to join the Indonesian Anxi Welfare Foundation on the same day to participate in the celebration of the 90th Anniversary of the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the Xuelong Anxi Hall. I participated in the activities of the celebration of the Xuelong Anxi Guild Hall and shared with the Anxi folks from all over the world. Hometown. On the occasion of the 90th Anniversary Celebration of the Xuelong Anxi Hall, three meetings were held at the same time, namely, the meeting of the Board of Supervisors of the World Anxi Lianyi Building, the joint meeting of the Secretary-General of the world's Anxi Association, and the leaders of Anxi County and the Anxi Township exchange meeting at home and abroad. On the morning of October 19th, the Xuelong Anxi Guild hosted a half-day tour of Kuala Lumpur for local folks. The Anxi Welfare Foundation folks in Indonesia and the Anxi folks in the area visited the beautiful scenery of Kuala Lumpur and experienced the beautiful cityscape of the Malaysian capital. In the evening, the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the establishment of the Xuelong Anxi Hall officially kicked off. More than 1,500 Anxi townships from all over the world gathered together for an unprecedented event. Lin Rongchao, director of the United Front Work Committee of the Anxi County Committee, Gao Zhiqiang, director of the Anxi County Education Bureau, Chen Junneng, director of the Anxi County People's Government Office, and many other leaders of the Anxi County People's Government attended the meeting. Chairman Lin Fushan of the Anxiu Club of Xuelong, Chairman of the Board Liao Zhonghua, Secretary-General Xu Fulai and other leaders warmly welcome the Anxi folks of all countries to share the wonderful moments of glory. The Anxi Association of Indonesia and the Anxi Society of the World exchanged souvenirs with the Xuelong Anxi Hall. I wish the Anxi Township around the world to continue the long-lasting nostalgia and continue the spirit of the Anxi people to achieve more glory! It is understood that there are a large number of people living in Anxi in Malaysia. In order to stay in Selangor, the folks in Kuala Lumpur have the opportunity to contact the friendship and seek common development. The ancestors of the ancestors initiated the establishment of the Xuelong Anxi Guild in 1929. When the spring comes to the autumn, people come and go, the wind and rain are unimpeded, the pines and cypresses are evergreen, and the branches are promising. At the celebration, the folks from all over the country exchanged ideas and talked about the goodness of their hometown. They cherish the opportunity to communicate with each other and leave a pleasant memory. I look forward to the folks living around the world adhering to the ""Anxi family of the world"" concept, more mutual visits and exchanges, enhance the friendship, affection, create opportunities for development, and give back to Mulberry. <strong>(for the Anxi Association)</strong>
