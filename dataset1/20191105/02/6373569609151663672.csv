Alligator filmed climbing fence into US air base as Royal Navy and HMS Queen Elizabeth make escape

A fearsome-looking alligator was filmed casually climbing into an American air base - not long after the Royal Navy's mammoth aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth had left.
The gator was filmed scaling the fence and wandering inside by a woman as she drove past the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend.
British sailors had a lucky escape of sorts, having spent considerable amounts of time at the base in recent weeks.
Video footage shows the alligator easily climbing the perimeter fence before landing inside the base and strolling away.
Remarkably, US defence officials say they don't even intend to catch the animal - unless it starts to pose a threat to residents there.



British armed forces have been at the base in recent days taking a delivery of a new anti-submarine warfare weapon that will protect the Royal Navy - and its continuous at sea deterrent, Trident.
The Ministry of Defence  is investing £3 billion in nine state-of-the-art Poseidon  jets which it says will enhance the UK’s tracking of hostile maritime targets, protect nuclear submarines and play a central role in NATO missions across the North Atlantic.
The Royal Navy's huge new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has also been in the area , with Royal Marines from Plymouth-based 42 Commando in tow.
The HMS Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group has been taking part in Westlant19 - an ongoing three-month wargames exercise in the North Atlantic, off the coast of the USA and Canada, featuring the UK and US allies.
The official HMS Queen Elizabeth Twitter account posted a link to the alligator video and quipped: ""Seems we left at just the right time!""



In September, six British sailors from the carrier - the Royal Navy's biggest ever ship - were detained in Florida over allegations of drunken behaviour.
HMS Queen Elizabeth had docked at the Mayport, in Jacksonville, to begin sea trials with joint-US fighters when shortly afterwards trouble was reported.
It was claimed that one of the sailors had to be Tasered by police while two others were also arrested for resisting officers.
The ship has on board a complement of sailors from RNAS Culdrose at Helston, who provide the air crews and support staff for the ship’s Merlin helicopters. There was no indication that sailors from Cornwall were involved in the unrest.
