評讑: 恐怖行動威脅越來越大

05 Nov 2019, 02:05

文/鄺耀章在萬丹省班迪格蘭鎮(Pandeglang)所發生的刺殺政治法律安全統籌部長威蘭多事件，再次提醒政府恐怖組織的威脅已越來越大。這樣的情況很嚴重，其實今年五月分已有傳言，謂恐佈組織有計劃要攻擊威蘭多、魯胡特．班查伊旦，與情報局長布迪．古納萬。現在這傳言已變成了事實。警察總部於五月份已獲知有恐怖組識要殺害或謀殺國家重要人物。我國於1957年曾經發生刺殺政治人物即當時的蘇卡諾的事件，並於2000年3月5日威脅人脅副議馬多利．阿杜爾．察利爾(Matori Abdul Djalil)。無論恐佈主義發動攻擊的動機為何，恐佈事件已經威脅了國內的治安。情報機構主任布迪.古諾萬(Budi Gunawan)說，情報機構自三個月前已開始注意嫌犯的行動。羅盤報10月11日已經在注意嫌犯在收集武器特別在收集刀器，因為有這些跡象，警方就應該加強對重要人物的安全保護。從流傳在世面上的視頻看出，當時對威蘭多的保安情況是何等的疏忽，威蘭多從車子出來才走了兩步，就被刺客刺殺。換言之，嫌犯就站在威蘭多很近的地方。政治人物需要接近民眾，但在現在的政治情況裡，警方更不能忘了保安的重要。對重要政治人物的標準保安措施更不能被忽略，特別是治安單位已經測出在10月20日總統副總統的就職禮時，會有破壞治安的行動。威蘭多的立場非常清楚，因此他成為恐怖組織攻擊的第一目標。無論恐怖組織的動機為何，政府務必要對抗之。我們支持政府揭開攻擊事件背後的真正幕後主持者是誰？警方在第一時間即公布，嫌犯是伊斯蘭國神權游擊隊成員。但其背後是否還有其他國內的支持者，現在還不知道。威蘭多是印尼第三號重要人物，是除了總統副總統之後的第三號重要人物，他的遇刺事件，促使保安單位加強對總統與副總統及其他重要政治人物的保安措施。印尼是法治的國家，不容許暗殺、謀殺、刺殺事件發生。在民主國家裡，可以有反對的聲音，可以有不同的意見，但必需遵守現有的法律，不允許超越法律範圍的行動，違反了法律就必須受到法律的制裁。

Comment: The threat of terrorist action is growing

05 Nov 2019, 02:05

The incident of the political and security coordinator of the political and security coordinator, the Wilando incident in Bandanglang, Banten province, once again reminded the government that the threat of terrorist organizations has grown. This situation is very serious. In fact, there have been rumors in May this year that Terrorist organizations have plans to attack Willando and Ruhut. Ban Chaydan, with intelligence chief Budi. Gunawan. This rumor has now become a reality. In May, the police headquarters was informed that there were terrorist groups who wanted to kill or murder important national figures. In 1957, China had the assassination of the politician, the then Sukarno incident, and on March 5, 2000, threatened the attack on Madori. Adour. Matori Abdul Djalil. Regardless of the motives of the terrorist attacks, the terrorist incident has threatened domestic law and order. Budi Gunawan, director of intelligence agencies, said the intelligence agency had begun to pay attention to the suspect's actions three months ago. The Compass reported on October 11 that the suspects are collecting weapons, especially in collecting knives, because with these signs, the police should strengthen the protection of important people. From the video circulating in the world, it was so negligent about the security situation in Wilando. Wilando took two steps from the car and was assassinated by the assassin. In other words, the suspect is standing close to Willando. Politicians need to be close to the people, but in the current political situation, the police must not forget the importance of security. The standard security measures for important politicians cannot be ignored. In particular, the security unit has already measured the actions of the president’s vice president on October 20 when there is a violation of law and order. Wilando’s position is very clear, so he became the first target of a terrorist organization attack. Regardless of the motives of terrorist organizations, the government must fight against it. Who do we support the government behind the attack? The police announced the first time that the suspect was a member of the Islamic State sacred guerrillas. But whether there are other domestic supporters behind it, I don’t know yet. Wilando is the third important figure in Indonesia. It is the third important person after the presidential vice president. His assassination has prompted security units to strengthen security measures for the president and vice president and other important political figures. Indonesia is a country ruled by law and does not allow assassinations, murders and assassinations. In a democratic country, there can be voices of opposition, and different opinions can be made, but it is necessary to abide by existing laws and not allow actions beyond the scope of the law. Violation of the law requires legal sanctions.
