      <h1>Bayern Munich ordered to improve after Niko Kovac exit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T02:45:55+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 02:45</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>MUNICH: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bayern-Munich">Bayern Munich</a>'s stars have been told to knuckle down under interim coach Hansi Flick ahead of their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/champions-league">Champions League</a> clash with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympiakos">Olympiakos</a> following <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Niko-Kovac">Niko Kovac</a>'s sacking.</p>
      <p>Former Bayern and West Germany defender Andreas Brehme says the Bayern squad "let Kovac down" with a series of lacklustre recent performances that led to the coach's dismissal, while the club's director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic has demanded more effort from his off-form players.</p>
      <p>"I now expect a positive development from our players and absolute motivation to achieve our goals for this season," he said.</p>
      <p>Group B leaders Bayern host bottom side Olympiakos at the Allianz Arena with a fourth straight Champions League win in their sights after beating the Greek side 3-2 in Athens a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Bayern already have one foot in the knock-out phase as they currently sit five-points clear of second-placed Tottenham, who they host in December having routed them 7-2 in north London last month.</p>
      <p>However, all is not well behind the scenes at the Bavarian giants, who dismissed Kovac on Sunday after winning just three of their last six games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Saturday's embarrassing 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt -- the defending champions' heaviest league defeat for a decade -- did for Kovac, who never enjoyed the full confidence of the club despite winning the league and cup double last season.</p>
      <p>The pressure is now on Bayern to perform under caretaker boss Flick against Olympiakos and prove that the weekend's battering was just a blip.</p>
      <p>Bayern need a confidence boosting-win in Europe before hosting second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in the Bundesliga with defending champions Munich fourth in the table, trailing current leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach by four points.</p>
      <p>Kovac's former assistant Flick, part of the Germany staff when they won the 2014 World Cup, has been promoted while a new head coach is sought with Ajax's Erik ten Hag, Jose Mourinho and Massimiliano Allegri among the early contenders.</p>
      <p>Flick takes charge of Bayern, albeit temporarily, with ringing endorsements from within the Germany set-up.</p>
      <p>National head coach Joachim Loew recently said Flick has "enormous qualities", both for his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi-dynamos">football</a> knowledge and as a man manager, while team director Oliver Bierhoff described Flick as a "competent expert".</p>
      <p>"He has already taken on the role as head coach in other jobs (at Hoffenheim and lower league club Victoria Bammental), I don't think he is afraid of it," added Bierhoff in Berlin on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, worryingly for both Flick and Bayern, there are reports that top-scoring striker Lewandowski needs a groin operation, which is likely to take place during next week's international break and could rule him out for up to 10 days.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old is enjoying the best season of his career to date with 20 goals in 16 games, including record 14 in the first 10 Bundesliga matches this season.</p>
      <p>Bayern struggled to a 2-1 win over second division side Bochum last week in the German Cup when Lewandowski only came on for the second half.</p>
