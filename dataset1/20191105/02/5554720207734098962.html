      <p>It wasn’t too long ago when Ira had taken to her social media page to <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-getting-a-yes-from-yuvraj-singhs-wife-hazel-keech-ira-reveals-casting-her-brother-junaid-khan-too/266631/">announce</a> that she had cast Hazel to play the lead role of Medea in her debut directorial venture, which is an adaptation of Euripides’ Greek tragedy <i>Medea. </i>Days later, she had also revealed the other casts of the play.</p>
      <p>The rehearsal for her play has begun in full swing and Ira has been refularly updating her fans about the goings-on behind the scene. She recently wrote, “I’m not very good at acting. I’m shy. And its something I never bothered to work on because I didn’t want to act. Turns out.. You need to act from time to time if you want to direct. Or be able to, willing to or, at the very least, understand how it works. It makes me have to get over myself (which is great). Sometimes I manage, sometimes I don’t. I’m working on it. The key is participating.”</p>
