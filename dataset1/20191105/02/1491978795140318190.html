      </p>
      <p>More than 50 people have been struck down with gastroenteritis at one of southeast Queensland’s popular island resorts after E coli bacteria was found in the drinking water.</p>
      <p>Managers at Tangalooma Resort on Moreton Island became aware of the issue last week when guests and staff began experiencing vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
      <p>Government officials suspect an underground aquifer on the island was contaminated.</p>
      <p>“It is a private water supply that is maintained and looked after by the facility managers,” Metro South <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health">Health</a> public health physician Kari Jarvinen said.</p>
      <p>“Bacteria must have entered into the water supply, whether through the storage tanks or a breakage.</p>
      <p>“We are still investigating and getting to understand exactly how their system works and where the contamination may have come from.”</p>
      <p>The water supply can be flushed or treated over several days and then monitored to make sure it is safe to drink, Dr Jarvinen said.</p>
      <p>He has warned of dehydration among holidaymakers who have become ill.</p>
      <p>Guests at the resort are being provided with free bottled water until the issue is resolved.</p>
      <p>The resort has also contacted 3000 guests who stayed there in recent weeks prior to the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Management is working closely with Brisbane city council and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> Health to determine how the contamination occurred.</p>
      <p>“We’re just testing to see where the source of it is, how did it get into the water supply because it’s never happened before and that’s what’s got us a little bit stumped here,” resort director David James told ABC radio on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the water reservoir was treated on Saturday and the resort is awaiting the results.</p>
      <p>“All we can wait for is the test results to come through and hopefully today or tomorrow we get some better news and it’s cleared up,” he said.</p>
