規模6.0地震襲智利 聖地亞哥建物晃動

05 Nov 2019, 02:16

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】美國地質調查所（USGS）4日表示，智利中部沿海城市科津波（Coquimbo）附近發生規模6.0地震，震央在港都瓦巴萊索（Valparaiso）東北方143公里，震源深度49公里。
地震造成首都聖地亞哥（Santiago）建築物晃動。不過，民眾因政府打算調漲地鐵費用仍持續抗議行動。該行動自上月（10月）中旬爆發以來，迅速蔓延至全國，智利總統皮涅拉（Sebastian Pinera）雖然取消漲價，也解散內閣，仍無法滅火，連亞太經濟合作會議（APEC）與Cop 25氣候變遷大會，都被迫取消。
智利國家緊急辦公室表示，尚未收到人員傷亡或建築、基礎建設受損的通報。



智利是世界上地震最頻繁的國家之一，1960年曾發生規模9.5 「Valdivia」地震，創下最高紀錄；2010年的8.8地震在智利引發海嘯，有500多人喪生。

Scale 6.0 earthquake hit Chile San Diego building shake

05 Nov 2019, 02:16

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The US Geological Survey (USGS) said on the 4th that a 6.0 earthquake occurred near Coquimbo, a coastal city in central Chile. The epicenter was in the northeast of Valparaiso. The area is 143 kilometers and the focal depth is 49 kilometers.
The earthquake caused the buildings in the capital Santiago to sway. However, the public continued to protest because of the government’s plan to increase the cost of the subway. Since the outbreak of the operation in the middle of last month (October), the action has spread rapidly to the whole country. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has been unable to extinguish the fire despite the cancellation of the price increase and the dissolution of the cabinet. Even the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC) and Cop The 25 Climate Change Conference was forced to cancel.
The National Emergency Office of Chile stated that it has not received any reports of casualties or damage to buildings and infrastructure.



Chile is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In 1960, the magnitude of the 9.5 ""Valdivia"" earthquake hit a record high. The 8.8 earthquake in 2010 triggered a tsunami in Chile, killing more than 500 people.
