太古血案內幕曝光 專家揭中共超限戰撕裂香港

05 Nov 2019, 02:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】中共四中全會後，港警暴行進一步升級。11月2日，港警抓捕200多人，並致54人被送醫救治。3日，港警在多區抓人並一度舉槍。當日，在太古城更出現砍人、咬掉議員耳朵的血腥暴行。有專家指出，這是北京精心製造的陰謀，用超限戰製造白色恐怖，撕裂香港社會。
11月2日，港人在港島、九龍、銅鑼灣等多地舉行和平集會，遭到警方狂射催淚彈、胡椒噴劑暴力鎮壓，有200多人被拘捕，許多人受傷，至少54人被送醫救治。
3日，港人發起「七區緊急行街」行動，反對警暴。港警在多區持续抓人，並一度舉槍。年輕人在太古城中心商場內手拉手組成人鏈，防暴警察在商場外施放催淚彈，並闖入商場用胡椒噴霧驅散人群，同時引發一起砍人事件。

當晚7時40分左右，在太古城中心外，一名講普通話的灰衣男子，突然從背包裡抽出長刀襲擊人群，致使一對夫妻兩人嚴重受傷，丈夫的背部和腹部鮮血直涌。
在場的太古城西區議員、民主動力召集人趙家賢上前勸止時，被該凶徒衝過來抱住並咬掉他的左耳朵，耳廓掉落在地上，現場血跡斑斑。
據報，該事件造成6人受傷送院，至少4人被砍傷，其中2人傷勢嚴重，地下鮮血一片。凶嫌的行徑激起眾怒，被憤怒的人群追打、制服，之後警察趕到現場。
民主黨立法會議員林卓廷質疑，警方多次硬闖太古城中心商場、粗暴帶走多名市民，警員行為往往挑動現場市民不滿，情緒升溫。警方剛一走，就發生襲擊事件，「究竟警方有無做好保護市民的責任？」
有報導稱，凶嫌在背包內藏刀，然後襲擊抗議者，顯然是有備而來。



大紀元報導說，砍人事件疑點重重。
疑點一：太古中心本來屬於私人領地，警察沒有特殊許可，不能隨意進入商場。但太古保安卻打開各個入口，讓速龍小隊警察進來，只是清場行動快結束時才假裝把警察鎖在門外。
疑點二，凶嫌砍人時高叫「光復台灣」，莫名其妙，是否有意嫁禍台灣？
疑點三，凶嫌除了持刀砍人還咬人。從錄像顯示，凶嫌咬人時，處於極度瘋狂亢奮狀態，似乎吃了興奮劑。
疑點四，錄像顯示，警察到場後，面對危險凶嫌，並沒有立即給其戴上手銬，控制其行動自由，採用一種半放任的處理方法。
疑點五，港警此前拘捕抗爭市民時，四五個警察粗暴地對付一名抗爭者，即使是女性也是立刻反綁其雙手，甚至用腳踢，用拳頭揍。警方對待市民和狂徒形成強烈對比。
事發後，中聯辦把太古城襲擊事件定性為不同意見的藍絲（支持港府與港警者）斬黃絲（支持抗爭者）的民事糾紛，宣稱警察在充當和事佬與調停人角色。

中共超限戰 挑起民眾互相仇殺

對此，華府中國問題專家石藏山表示：「這是流氓說法！」，這不是普通的民眾互毆，是北京精心製造的騙局和陰謀，目的是用超限戰手法撕裂香港社會，製造恐怖氣氛。
剛剛結束的中共四中全會決定要「立即解決香港問題」，整個策略定下來了，北京不會出兵，但港警會大開殺戒，用紅色恐怖來鎮壓抗爭市民。
石藏山分析說，從太古事件可以看到警察行凶的新特徵：首先是私闖民宅抓人。太古城是私人地方，警察卻闖進去了。還有闖入屯門私人餐廳及屋苑寶怡花園及兆軒苑逸生閣，以及大埔富雅花園及大埔中心等，這是違法的。
其次、警察對所做之事不用負責。以前香港警察執行公務都要佩帶委任證和肩頭編號。現在不但越來越多警察不佩帶編號，還徹底蒙面，人們根本不知道那個頭盔面罩之下是誰在幹壞事。
再者，還有的警察公開說：「雞姦很好玩，打死算自殺！」故意挑釁民眾；狂徒咬議員耳朵後還叫囂「台灣獨立」；還有的警察故意用激將法市民罵怒他，只要你一罵，他就抓人，故意在香港製造混亂局面。

石藏山分析說，中共在香港展開超限戰，可以體現在4個方面：
一，私闖民宅；二，製造社會仇恨，例如在太古城發生的慘案，港府最毒的一句話是「不同政見也不要私了」，完全不符合實際情況；三，警察成為政治工具，不用為所有違法的行為負責任。香港近期在短時間出現的浮屍、跳樓案，數目之多極不尋常。
還有不少抗爭者說有手足（同行的抗爭者）失蹤。當年中共江澤民集團對法輪功的鎮壓就直接下達「打死算自殺」的密令。
四，製造白色恐怖。超限戰的目的是要讓人恐慌，過程中不斷打破道德底線，並利用曲解法律，達到整治鎖定的目標人物。

香港高等法院10月31日頒發臨時網絡言論禁制令，以及10月5日實施的《禁蒙面法》，雖然全面禁網在香港不可能做到，但可為港府逮捕抗爭者製造口實，亦有可能是中共刻意營造白色恐怖及寒蟬效應。
石藏山披露：中共現在搞的，就是大陸那一套，比如中共政法委對待法輪功群眾就是「打死算自殺」，江澤民下令對法輪功要從「名譽上搞臭，經濟上搞垮，肉體上消滅」，中共想在三個月內消滅法輪功，現在20年都過去了，法輪功日益壯大，而中共政權卻搖搖欲墜。
他表示，反送中遊行時很多民眾高舉的標語是『天滅中共』。不管中共如何處心積慮地搞超限戰，但最終結局必然是中共的解體滅亡。
11月4日，香港公民黨主席、資深大律師梁家傑在VOA《香港風雲》節目中也表示，香港不是孤軍奮戰，「國際戰線」要拉開。
梁家傑說，這兩個星期他在訪問法國、英國、歐盟時，都和他們說，現在港人做的是自由人權法制、生活方式的保衛戰，絕對不是港人孤獨的、單獨的作戰。
香港是屬於自由民主模式陣型的一員。如果香港在這一場保衛戰中打輸了，不僅僅是香港輸了，也是自由民主陣型退的一大步，也是中共向全世界推銷中共專制模式的進一步。
梁家傑表示，在香港這場持續多月的「水革命」當中，港人有不可推卸的責任，就是在世界上打好自由人權法制、生活方式的保衛戰。「現在我們已經充當這個角色了，不忘初衷，也不會放棄。」

Insider exposure of Taikoo bloody case Experts unveiled the CCP's over-limit war to tear Hong Kong

05 Nov 2019, 02:36

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hong Kong police atrocities were further upgraded. On November 2, the Hong Kong police arrested more than 200 people and 54 people were sent to hospital for medical treatment. On the 3rd, the Hong Kong police arrested people in multiple districts and fired guns once. On the same day, in the ancient city of Taikoo, there was a bloody atrocity that slashed people and bitten off the ears of the members. Some experts pointed out that this is a conspiracy carefully crafted by Beijing to create white horror and torn Hong Kong society with ultra-limit warfare.
On November 2nd, Hong Kong people held peaceful gatherings on Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Causeway Bay and other places. They were violently suppressed by police bursting tear gas and pepper spray. More than 200 people were arrested and many were injured. At least 54 people were sent to hospital. Treatment.
On the 3rd, the Hong Kong people launched the ""Seven Districts Emergency Street"" operation against the police. The Hong Kong police continued to arrest people in various districts and once fired guns. Young people hand in hand in the Taikoo Shing Center shopping mall to form a chain of people, riot police cast tear gas bombs outside the mall, and broke into the mall with pepper spray to disperse the crowd, and triggered a hacking incident.


On the evening of November 3, outside the center of Taikoo City, a mob rushed over and hugged the district board member Zhao Jiaxian and brutally bit his left ear. (video screenshot)

At about 7:40 that night, outside the center of Taikoo City, a man in gray who spoke Mandarin, suddenly pulled a long knife from his backpack and attacked the crowd, causing a serious injury to both husband and wife. The husband's back and abdomen blood rushed.
When Zhao Jiaxian, a member of the Taikoo City West District and the convener of democracy, came forward to persuade him, he was rushed over by the murderer and bitten off his left ear. The ear was dropped on the ground and the scene was bloody.
According to reports, the incident caused six people to be injured and sent to hospital, at least four people were chopped, two of them were seriously injured and there was blood in the ground. The murderous act provoked anger, was chased and subdued by angry crowds, and the police rushed to the scene.
Lin Zhuo-ting, a member of the Democratic Legislative Council, questioned that the police had repeatedly smashed the Taikoo City Center shopping mall and rudely took away many citizens. The behavior of police officers often provoked dissatisfaction on the scene and raised their mood. As soon as the police left, there was an attack. ""Is the police responsible for protecting the public?""
It has been reported that the murderer has hidden a knife in the backpack and then attacked the protesters. Obviously, it is well prepared.



The Epoch Times reported that there were many doubts about the hacking incident.
Doubt 1: The Taikoo Center was originally a private territory. The police did not have special permission and could not enter the mall at will. However, the security guards of Taikoo opened the various entrances and let the Athlon squad policemen come in. It was only at the end of the clearance operation that they pretended to lock the police outside the door.
Doubt 2: When the murder is murdered, it is called ""Recovering Taiwan"". It is inexplicable. Is it intentional to blame Taiwan?
Doubt three, the murderer is not only holding a knife to hack people but also biting people. From the video shows that when the fierce bite is biting, it is in a state of extreme madness and excitement, and seems to have eaten stimulants.
Suspicious point four, the video shows that after the police arrived, in the face of dangerous suspicions, they did not immediately handcuff them, control their freedom of movement, and adopt a semi-lost treatment.
Doubt 5: When the Hong Kong police arrested the anti-competitive citizens, four or five police officers violently dealt with a protester. Even women were immediately tied to their hands, even kicked and kicked with their fists. The police have a strong contrast with the public and the madmen.
After the incident, the Liaison Office identified the Taikoo City attack as a different opinion of the Blue Silk (supporting the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Police) and Huang Si (supporting the protesters) civil dispute, claiming that the police are acting as a peacemaker and mediator. .

The CCP’s over-limit war provokes people to vendetta

In this regard, the Chinese government expert Shi Zangshan said: ""This is a rogue!"" This is not an ordinary people's mutual enthusiasm. It is a carefully crafted scam and conspiracy in Beijing. The purpose is to use the ultra-limit warfare method to tear Hong Kong society. Create a climate of terror.
The just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party decided to ""solve the Hong Kong issue immediately."" The whole strategy was settled. Beijing will not send troops, but the Hong Kong Police will kill the ring and use red terror to suppress the citizens.
According to the analysis of Shizangshan, from the events of the Taikoo, we can see the new characteristics of the police murder: first, private houses are arrested. Taikoo Shing is a private place, but the police broke in. It is also illegal to enter the Tuen Mun private restaurant and the estates of Po Yip Garden and Siu Shing Court Yi Shing Court, as well as Tai Po Fu Ya Garden and Tai Po Centre.
Second, the police are not responsible for what they do. In the past, the Hong Kong police had to wear a warrant card and a shoulder number for performing official duties. Now, not only are more and more police officers not wearing numbers, but they are also completely masked. People don’t even know who is doing bad things under the helmet mask.
In addition, some police officers publicly said: ""The sodomy is very fun, killing is a suicide!"" Deliberately provoke the people; the madman bites the member’s ear and screams ""Taiwan independence""; and some police deliberately use the anger to anger the citizens. He, as long as you look at it, he will arrest people and deliberately create chaos in Hong Kong.

According to Shi Zangshan’s analysis, the CCP’s launch of an ultra-limit war in Hong Kong can be reflected in four aspects:
First, private homes; Second, to create social hatred, such as the tragedy in Taikoo City, the most poisonous sentence of the Hong Kong Government is ""different political views are not private"", completely inconsistent with the actual situation; Third, the police become political tools, You are not responsible for all illegal actions. The number of floating corpses and jumped buildings that have recently appeared in Hong Kong in a short period of time is extremely unusual.
There are still many protesters who say that there are brothers and sisters (residents in the same trade) missing. In the same year, the Jiang Zemin Group’s suppression of Falun Gong directly issued a secret order of “killing death”.
Fourth, create white horror. The purpose of the over-limit war is to make people panic. In the process, they constantly break the moral bottom line and use the misinterpretation of the law to achieve the target of rectification.

The Hong Kong High Court issued a temporary online speech injunction on October 31 and the ""banned mask law"" implemented on October 5. Although the comprehensive ban is impossible in Hong Kong, it can create a false impression for the Hong Kong government to arrest the protesters. It is also possible that the CCP deliberately created a white terror and chilling effect.
Shizangshan revealed: The CCP is now engaged in the mainland. For example, the CCP’s Politics and Law Committee treats the Falun Gong masses as ""killing and committing suicide."" Jiang Zemin ordered that Falun Gong should be stigmatized from the reputation, economically messed up, and physically To eliminate, the CCP wants to eliminate Falun Gong within three months. Now 20 years have passed, Falun Gong has grown stronger, and the Chinese Communist regime has been faltering.
He said that when the anti-delivery parade, many people held the slogan ""The CCP is annihilated."" No matter how the CCP is deliberately engaged in over-limit wars, the final outcome must be the demilitarization of the CCP.
On November 4th, Hong Kong Citizens Party Chairman and Senior Counsel Liang Jiajie also said in the VOA ""Hong Kong Fengyun"" program that Hong Kong is not alone, and the ""international front"" is to be opened.
Liang Jiajie said that during his visit to France, the United Kingdom and the European Union these two weeks, he said to them that Hong Kong people are now fighting for a free human rights legal system and a way of life. It is definitely not a lonely, individual battle for Hong Kong people.
Hong Kong is a member of the liberal democracy model. If Hong Kong loses in this battle, not only Hong Kong loses, but also a major step forward in the liberal democratic formation, and it is also a further step in the CCP’s promotion of the CCP’s autocratic model to the world.
Mr Leung said that in Hong Kong's ""water revolution"" that lasted for many months, Hong Kong people have an unshirkable responsibility to lay a solid defense of the legal system of free human rights and the way of life in the world. ""Now we have played this role, don't forget the original intention, and will not give up.""
