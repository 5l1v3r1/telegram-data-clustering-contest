05 Nov 2019, 02:19

At around 4:45 am on the 5th, a passerby found fire from a Japanese sweet shop “Takayama Confectionery” in Inaho, Otaru, Hokkaido. According to the Otaru Station and the Otaru Fire Department, the building on the second floor of the wooden building was burnt down, and two men and women were transported to the hospital and confirmed dead.
It seems that the women in their 80s and men in their 50s died. The Otaru station is rushing to confirm the identity of the store because it is highly likely that the person involved in the store has lost contact after the fire.
The store is a long-established Japanese confectionery store in a corner of a residential area about 500 meters north of JR Otaru Station. The building is a store and a residence, and the second floor is said to be burning hard.
