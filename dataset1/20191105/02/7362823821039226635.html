      <h1>Washington Nationals' Stephen Strasburg denies snubbing Trump at White House</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T02:33:15+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 02:33</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>World Series MVP pitcher Stephen Strasburg is not going to put up with the Internet’s “fake news.”</p>
      <p>That was the hashtag he used showing a video of him and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> celebrating their victory at the White House with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-honors-nationals-world-series-victory">Strasburg had been accused of snubbing Trump</a> in a deceptively trimmed viral video, as <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/11/nationals-strasburg-trump-handshake-video-white-house-snub">USA TODAY</a> reported, so the 31-year-old right-hander tweeted the full video showing him <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-hugs-washington-nationals-kurt-suzuki-world-series-maga">shaking hands with the president</a>.</p>

      <p>Strasburg went 5-0 in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb-postseason">MLB postseason</a> as the Nationals won their first world championship in franchise history.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/world-series-mvp-stephen-strasburg-opts-to-be-free-agent-reports">Strasburg has opted out</a> of the final four years of his contract, making him a free agent. The decision meant he was leaving $100 million on the table – with the prospect of earning more, either from the Nationals or another team.</p>
      <p>The Nationals defeated the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/houston-astros">Houston Astros</a> in seven games to win the World Series this past Wednesday, coming back from a 3-2 series deficit.</p>
      <p>They were the first World Series winner with all four victories coming on the road.</p>
