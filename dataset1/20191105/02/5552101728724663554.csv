【頭家開講】少爺「把風」謀反攻　艾美特電器董事長史瑞斌
05 Nov 2019, 02:55 by 邱莞仁, 林育緯, 吳明曄
父親史鴻堯創立年收破百億元的小家電製造廠，除穩定代工外銷日韓市場，還推出自有品牌「艾美特」，市占一度穩居中國電扇第2大、電暖器第1大。史鴻堯生前定下「傳賢不傳子」的經營方針，直到去年，專業經營團隊年事漸高，艾美特亦面臨中國市場轉變及股價滑落等挑戰，長子史瑞斌接任董事長。
他對內大刀闊斧、整併部門，對外找來首任代言人賈靜雯強化品牌印象，還瞄準東南亞市場。多箭齊發，在前3季獲利基礎下，力拚全年轉虧為盈、重返市占第一。



「去年『雙11』我們做了4700萬元人民幣（約新台幣2億元），今年應該會很熱鬧。」距離中國年度網購盛事「雙11」不到一週，史瑞斌帶著我們參觀艾美特深圳總廠，超過50坪的展示間放滿各式風扇、電暖器與空氣清淨機。


艾美特以電機製造為核心，為韓國品牌生產空氣清淨與循環扇功能的產品。

艾美特電器為小家電代工製造商，1997年推出自有品牌「艾美特AIRMATE」，目前是中國風扇與電暖器市場第2大品牌。其中，電暖器從2005年至2015年，連續10年拿下市占第一的佳績。
目前艾美特在中國內外銷比重各半，代工客戶包括日本日立與KOIZUMI、韓國三星、美國Vornado，以及德國Rowenta等，去年創下106億元營收。


史瑞斌（左）曾管過內銷、品保，他說自己最常散步的地方就是工廠。

　
初接董座　夜夜鎮定劑
在小家電界赫赫有名，史瑞斌卻沒大老闆派頭。他和員工直接用微信溝通，打破僵化的層層通報制度，各部門需要錄製宣傳影片，都找他當男主角。職員讚他親和力十足，是配合最高、出鏡率最多的董事長，天生娃娃臉的史瑞斌頓時有些靦腆，「唉唷，我是上不了台的那種，但我想我能做的就做。」
「沒當董事長前，我管過內銷、品保，就是跟他們一起幹事情的。有什麼事『微』我就好啦。」史瑞斌秀出對話視窗，「像上次開會走不了，我趕快發一條叫他們來救我。」和員工談笑風生，很難想像，1年多前他得靠鎮定劑才能入睡。

去年6月中，艾美特創辦人史鴻堯長子史瑞斌接任董事長。「剛接任的那3個月，我在深圳的宿舍跟台灣的家裡，床邊都是一排一排的鎮定劑。」找不到跟壓力相處的模式，「我吹著冷氣，全身冒汗，越想越煩。藥效4小時一過，我就醒來，整個人內分泌失調，滿臉痘痘。」
「有句俗語說『生意囝歹生』。」史瑞斌苦笑，「屬於第2代，我自己壓力很大。」操盤年收百億元的企業，令他壓力劇增，更擔心追不上父親的成就。
　
受寵長男　留日才知苦
1973年，電機學徒出身的史鴻堯在台南創立「東富電器」，代工小家電。「一開始做風扇電機，但只做單季看天吃飯的生意很辛苦，才衍生出相應的電暖器、溫度調節器和加濕器。」
因台灣生產成本上揚，1990年，史鴻堯前往深圳設立「威昂電器」，和威昂第1任總經理李博輝與副總李麗珠，從利潤較低的風扇和電暖器OEM轉做ODM，當年年底又與艾美特現任副董事長蔡正富合作，隔年公司更名為「艾美特電器」。


艾美特為小家電代工製造商，是中國風扇與電暖器市場第二大品牌。

父母忙於工作，史瑞斌從小寄養在姑婆家，「週末我爸會來看我，我對他雖能感受到父愛，但又有距離、很尷尬的心態。」或許是為了彌補無法陪伴孩子的缺憾，「國中時，父親的生意已經蠻成功。我不敢說我是含著金湯匙長大，但是銀湯匙總是有的，又是備受寵愛的長男，要什麼就有什麼，講真的我爸對我有點溺愛。」史瑞斌高職畢業後，父親便安排他赴日磨練。
「我人生的第一個轉捩點，就是在日本的那5年。」前3年史瑞斌在東京和名古屋求學，後2年則進入艾美特客戶、日本湯淺株式會社的子公司上班。「以前我不懂事，反正就是伸手，到了日本才知道，原來吃一頓飯要這麼多錢。」史瑞斌逗趣地說：「我學著去超市買菜回來煮，可是豬肉沒煮熟就吃下去，肚子搞壞、有幽門桿菌，還回台就醫。」


史瑞斌（中）曾在日本磨練5年，日本客戶通常由他親自接待，以一口流利的日語拉近與客戶的距離。

日本是艾美特的重要市場，小家電代工年出貨量達800萬台，日本客戶通常由能說一口流利日語的史瑞斌親自接待，「老闆出馬，不用翻譯，你跟客戶的關係也會比較親近。」



　
日子太爽　被拱接大位
2002年，史瑞斌返台不久便進入深圳艾美特上班，從總務採購員做起，4年後在台灣的父親卻因罹患肺部腫瘤頻繁進出醫院。「那時我偶爾會從深圳回台，但父親已經算是比較不好了。」為就近照顧父親，史瑞斌回到東富電器擔任董事長特助，但半年後父親便因病過世。
史鴻堯生前仿效高科技公司，開放資深員工配股，並立下了「傳賢不傳子」的經營方針。股份多由史家持有的東富電器，由史瑞斌接任董事長，同時兼任艾美特董事，而當年和史鴻堯合夥的創始人鄭立平與蔡正富，則分別出任艾美特董事長與副董事長一職，另聘請楊裕復出任執行長。
在專業經理人帶領下，艾美特代工外銷穩定發展，除日、韓之外，德、法與義市場亦有所突破。直到去年，鄭立平身體微恙，「當初父親的團隊已經年邁了，鄭董問我：『你在台灣過得生活太舒服啦，要回來再學習嗎？』我告訴自己，要做就做到最好，不然不要做。」
史瑞斌接任前，艾美特在代工和自有品牌市場看似穩妥，實際上卻面臨中國市場內銷方式轉變帶來的虧損，及股價持續探底等挑戰。「2013年上市之後，我們股價走得不太順遂。有段時間，甚至有銀行夥伴發出『貴公司未來堪憂』等報告。」史瑞斌苦笑說：「去年下半年，我就是這樣過來的。」他笑著解釋，眉頭卻鎖得更緊。
　
多方止虧　大數據助攻
從頭整頓龐大的事業體，史瑞斌一度身兼董事長、總經理等五個職務。想起父親從小耳提面命的叮嚀，「他常說做生意哪有什麼困難？就是開源跟節流。」早期建廠時，因深圳配套產業不足，艾美特產品自製率達95％，「外面買的品質不能控制，我們進口塑膠粒自己灌，風扇網子自己從鐵線開始做。」
史瑞斌一面加發績效獎金，同時大刀闊斧整併部門，並減少短期投資，「我一上來就把電子課關掉。以前我們的機板還用10年前的方式手動插件，這沒有競爭力、沒有價格優勢，現在都已經自動化了。」他將產品自製率降至65％，低端產品委外製造，「現在2019年了，深圳什麼沒有？」
「我沒辦法跟員工說我愛你們，對不起，公司沒賺錢。」史瑞斌坦言接任後，離開或調部門的高階主管超過15人，「改革一定有陣痛期，一定不習慣，我希望大家支持我、不是配合我。從以前的成績，我看不到不改的理由。」


史瑞斌（左）與弟弟史瑞霖（右）個性一慢一快，而身兼艾美特研發長的史瑞霖，喜歡上群眾募資網站挖掘新創商品。

胡蘿蔔與棍子並行收到成效，今年上半年艾美特營收63.29億元，毛利率創6年單季新高。而為減少業績深受氣候冷熱影響，內部也成立用戶研究中心，以大數據分析消費者使用習慣，作為產品改良依據。
過去艾美特產品開發策略是「提早2年儲備」。史瑞斌說：「卡早阮爸說，開10套（模具）中2套就好，現在真的不行，一套模具都是新台幣近千萬元的投入。很多東西隨時在變，要有數據化、平台化，不是去猜消費者想要或應該會喜歡什麼。」











拿出一台藉由數據改良、今年上半年在中國銷量最好的循環扇，史瑞斌解釋，「傳統循環扇是矮個子，因為頭重、再做脖子就會倒，但我們克服了這個問題。」把循環扇的頸部拉長、可180度擺動，即使是開著暖氣的房間，也能讓空氣流通，打破風扇只能賣夏季的迷思。
「在中國，你沒有領先同業的地方，真的是掰掰了。」史瑞斌說，這款循環扇單價人民幣1499元（約新台幣6500元），上半年賣了人民幣2.5億元（約新台幣11億元），「現在消費者不要買便宜的東西，很多人要的是質。」多箭齊發下，被視為傳統淡季的第3季，今年也轉虧為盈，「這只是第1年，我要未來每年Q3都賺錢。」


站在分貝測試室內，史瑞斌說，開發新品要靠數據平台分析，不能猜測評估消費者的喜好。

　
天天直播　備戰雙十一
在拓展中國市場上，實體店面的傳統促銷戰早就無法抓住消費者的心。洞悉線上消費力崛起，「雙11」起跑的前1個月，艾美特在中國最大網購平台「淘寶」上與網紅合作，每晚8點開設一檔直播維持熱度，最高記錄1分鐘賣出6,000台電扇。
史瑞斌更找來藝人賈靜雯，擔任艾美特創辦以來首位代言人。「當企劃的夥伴告訴我想找代言人時，第一時間我也是『啊…』倒退三步，但想了幾天，我就決定要做。」他分析，中國的品牌競爭已經走到第3波戰國時期，「我們從代工一路以來，看到很多品牌的興衰。如何繼續生存下去、竄出一條路，『品牌續存力』是很重要的。」
展示間內擺著賈靜雯醒目的等身高人形立牌，由她代言的新款移動電暖器，外觀神似音響，因採無接縫一體成形，可避免熱脹冷縮。「這在工藝上，跟同行就有很大的不同」，加上以石墨烯作為發熱體，改善電暖器乾燥、需搭配加濕器使用的習慣，史瑞斌說：「你不跟上時代，就會被時代給拋棄。」

今年8月，史瑞斌從業界找來專業經理人林永昌出任執行總經理，積極布局東南亞，目標2年後貢獻營收。
弟弟、艾美特外銷業務部經理史瑞霖，身兼研發長，喜歡上群眾募資網站挖掘新創商品，「我們從小在工廠長大，缺點就是腦袋比較硬、面向不夠廣。」史瑞霖認為，「我父親對艾美特的期望是百年企業，永續經營不一定要我們兄弟，或者姓史的來做。」
提起父親，史瑞斌眼眶有些泛紅。他形容自己一向是感性大於理性，「這（成績）算是送給我父親在天之靈…未來如果大陸大大小小所有家庭，都能夠有我們的商品。哇，這是一個很不得了的事情。」

艾美特首度啟用藝人賈靜雯當代言人，賈靜雯便拿下金鐘視后，讓外界直呼史瑞斌賺到了。「可能我比較會花錢。」他掩不住得意，「人選是企劃同仁推薦的，但一花錢就成功是真的。」

[The first head of the family] The young master ""returns the wind"" to counterattack Shi Ruibin, chairman of Aimeite Electric
05 Nov 2019, 02:55 by Qiu Wanren, Lin Yuwei, Wu Mingwei
His father Shi Hongjun founded a small household appliance manufacturer that broke through 10 billion yuan in the year. In addition to stable OEM sales to the Japanese and Korean markets, he also launched its own brand “Emmett”. The market share was once the second largest in China's electric fan and the largest in electric heaters. . Shi Hongjun set the business policy of ""passing the sages and not passing the sons"" before his death. Until last year, the professional management team became increasingly high. Emmett also faced challenges such as the transformation of the Chinese market and the decline in stock prices. The eldest son Shi Ruibin took over as chairman.
He made a bold and comprehensive department, and found the first spokesperson Jia Jingwen to strengthen the brand impression, and also aimed at the Southeast Asian market. With more than one arrow, under the profit of the first three quarters, we strived to turn profitable and return to the market for the first time.



""Last year, we have made 47 million yuan (about NT$200 million). This year, it should be very lively."" Less than a week before the annual online shopping event ""Double 11"" in China, Shi Ruibin took us to visit Emmett Shenzhen. At the factory, more than 50 pings of display rooms are filled with various fans, electric heaters and air purifiers.


Emmett manufactures air purification and circulation fan functions for Korean brands with motor manufacturing as its core.

Emmett Electric is a small appliance foundry manufacturer. In 1997, it launched its own brand “Emmett AIRMATE”, which is currently the second largest brand in China's fan and electric heater market. Among them, from 2005 to 2015, the electric heater won the first place in the market for 10 consecutive years.
At present, Emmett sells at home and abroad in half, and OEM customers include Japan's Hitachi and KOIZUMI, South Korea's Samsung, US Vornado, and Germany's Rowenta, which generated revenue of 10.6 billion yuan last year.


Shi Ruibin (left) once managed domestic sales and quality assurance. He said that the place where he walks most often is the factory.


First time, Dong Fang, night and night tranquilizer
In the field of small household appliances, he is famous, but Shi Ruibin did not have a big boss. He and the staff directly communicated with WeChat, breaking the rigid layer of notification system, and all departments need to record promotional videos and find him a leading actor. The staff praised him for his affinity. He is the chairman with the highest and most appearance rate. Shi Ruibin, who is born with a baby face, is a bit embarrassed. ""Hey, I can't get on the stage, but I think I can do it."" ""
""Before I was a chairman, I managed domestic sales and quality assurance. I just did things with them. I have nothing to do with ""micro""."" Shi Ruibin showed a dialogue window. ""Like the last meeting, I can’t go, I Hurry and send a message to them to save me."" It is hard to imagine talking to employees. He had to rely on tranquilizers to fall asleep more than a year ago.


In 1973, Shi Hongjun (front row right 1) founded Dongfu Electric in Tainan, and Shi Ruibin (the second in the back row) was his eldest son and was highly favored. (provided by Shi Ruibin)

In mid-June last year, Emmett founder Shi Hongjun, the eldest son of Shi Erbin, took over as chairman. ""In the three months after I took over, I was in a dormitory in Shenzhen and a home in Taiwan. There were rows of sedatives at the bedside."" I couldn’t find a way to get along with the pressure. ""I blew air and sweated all over the body."" The more I want to get annoyed. After 4 hours of treatment, I woke up, the whole person has endocrine disorders, and the face is acne.""
""There is a saying that ""business is alive""."" Shi Ruibin smiled. ""Belonging to the second generation, I am under great pressure."" The company that has received 10 billion yuan in annual sales has increased his pressure and is more worried that he will not be able to catch up. Father's achievement.

Being favored by a long man
In 1973, Shi Hongjun, an electrician apprentice, founded ""Dongfu Electric"" in Tainan, and found small appliances. ""Being a fan motor at first, but only doing a single-season business is very hard, and the corresponding electric heaters, thermostats and humidifiers are derived.""
Due to the rising production costs in Taiwan, in 1990, Shi Hongyi went to Shenzhen to set up ""Wei An Electric"", and Wei An's first general manager Li Bohui and vice president Li Lizhu, from the lower profit fans and electric heaters OEM to ODM, the year At the end of the year, he cooperated with Emerald's current vice chairman, Cai Zhengfu. The company changed its name to ""Emmett Electric"" in the following year.


Emmett is the OEM manufacturer of small household appliances and the second largest brand in China's fan and electric heater market.

Parents are busy with their work. Shi Ruibin was fostered at his aunt's house. ""My dad will come to see me on weekends. I can feel the father's love for him, but I have a distance and awkward attitude."" Perhaps to make up for the inability to accompany the children. ""In the middle of the country, my father's business has been quite successful. I dare not say that I grew up with a gold spoon, but the silver spoon is always there, and it is a much-loved long man. What do you want? Tell me the truth. Dad is a little bit lovable to me."" After Shi Leibin graduated from high school, his father arranged for him to go to Japan to hone.
""The first turning point in my life was the five years in Japan."" Shi Ruibin studied in Tokyo and Nagoya for the first three years, and went to work for Emmett customers and subsidiaries of Japan Yuasa Co., Ltd. in the next two years. ""I used to be ignorant. Anyway, I reached out. It was only in Japan that I knew that it was so much money to eat a meal."" Shi Ruibin said with a funny saying: ""I learned to go to the supermarket to buy food and cook it, but the pork was not cooked. The stomach is bad, there is Helicobacter pylori, and I am going back to Taiwan for medical treatment.""


Shi Ruibin (middle) has been honed in Japan for 5 years, and Japanese customers are usually personally received by him, and he is close to the customer with a fluent Japanese.

Japan is an important market for Emmett. The annual shipment of small household appliances is 8 million units. Japanese customers are usually personally received by Shi Ruibin, who speaks fluent Japanese. ""The boss is out, no translation, your relationship with customers will be closer."" .""




The days are too cool.
In 2002, Shi Ruibin entered Shenzhen Emmett to work soon after he returned to Taiwan. He started from the general affairs buyer. Four years later, his father in Taiwan frequently entered and exited the hospital because of lung cancer. ""At that time, I occasionally returned to Shenzhen from Shenzhen, but my father was already quite bad."" In order to take care of his father, Shi Ruibin returned to Dongfu Electric as the special support of the chairman, but his father died of illness after half a year.
Shi Hongjun emulated a high-tech company before his death, opened up senior staff to share shares, and set up a business policy of ""passing the sages and not passing on the child."" Dongfu Electric, which is owned by historians, was replaced by Shi Ruibin as the chairman and concurrently as a director of Emmett. In the same year, Zheng Liping and Cai Zhengfu, the founders of Shi Hongjun, became the chairman and vice chairman of Emmett, respectively. Yang Yufu became the CEO.
Under the leadership of professional managers, Emmett's OEM sales have developed steadily. In addition to Japan and Korea, the German, French and Italian markets have also made breakthroughs. Until last year, Zheng Liping was very weak. ""The father's team was old. Zheng Dong asked me: ""You lived in Taiwan too comfortable. Would you like to come back and study again?"" I told myself that I would do the most. Ok, don't do it.""
Before Shi Ruibin took over, Emmett appeared to be safe in the OEM and private label market. In fact, it faced the challenges of the loss of the domestic market in the Chinese market and the continued bottoming out of the stock price. ""After listing in 2013, our stock price did not go smoothly. Some time, even bank partners issued reports such as ""Your company is worried about the future."" Shi Ruibin said with a smile: ""In the second half of last year, I came here."" Laughing and explaining, the brow is locked tighter.

Multi-party stop loss big data assists
From the beginning to rectify a huge business, Shi Ruibin once served as chairman and general manager. I remembered my father’s embarrassment from a younger ear. ""He often said that there is any difficulty in doing business? It is open source and throttling."" When the factory was built in the early days, due to the shortage of supporting industries in Shenzhen, the self-made rate of Emmett products reached 95%. Control, we import the plastic pellets ourselves, the fan nets themselves start from the iron wire.""
Shi Ruibin added performance bonuses at the same time, and at the same time drastically consolidated the department and reduced short-term investment. ""I turned off the e-learning as soon as I came up. In the past, our board also used manual plug-ins 10 years ago. This is not competitive, no. The price advantage has now been automated."" He reduced the product self-manufacturing rate to 65%, and the low-end products were made out of manufacturing. ""Now 2019, what is there in Shenzhen?""
""I can't tell employees that I love you. Sorry, the company didn't make any money."" Shi Ruibin said that after taking over, more than 15 senior executives left or transferred to the department. ""The reform must have a painful period and must not be used. I hope everyone will support me."" Not with me. From the previous results, I can't see the reason for not changing.""


Shi Ruibin (left) and his younger Shi Ruilin (right) have a slower personality, and Shi Ruilin, who is also the chief executive of Emmett, likes to recruit new websites to explore new products.

Carrots and sticks received results in parallel. In the first half of this year, Emmett's revenue was 6.329 billion yuan, and the gross profit margin hit a new high in 6 years. In order to reduce the performance and suffer from the cold and hot weather, a user research center has also been set up to analyze consumer habits with big data as a basis for product improvement.
In the past, Emmett's product development strategy was “early 2 years reserve”. Shi Ruibin said: ""Card said that Dad said that it would be good to open 2 sets of 10 sets of molds. Now it is really impossible. A set of molds is about NT$10 million. Many things are changing at any time. And platformization, not to guess what consumers want or should like.""











Taking out a circulating fan that was the best-selling in China in the first half of this year by data improvement, Shi Ruibin explained, ""The traditional circulation fan is short, because the head is heavy and the neck will fall again, but we have overcome this problem."" The neck of the circulation fan is stretched and can be swung 180 degrees. Even in a room with heating, the air can be circulated, and the fan can only sell the myth of summer.
""In China, you don't have a place to lead the industry. It's really awkward."" Shi Ruibin said that the circulating fan has a unit price of RMB 1,499 (about NT$6,500) and sold RMB 250 million in the first half of the year (about NT$). ""1.1 billion yuan"", ""Now consumers don't buy cheap things. Many people want quality."" The multi-arrows are seen as the third season of the traditional off-season. This year, it turned into a profit. ""This is only the first. In 1 year, I want to make money every year in Q3.""


Standing in the decibel test room, Shi Ruibin said that the development of new products depends on the data platform analysis, can not guess the evaluation of consumer preferences.


Daily live broadcast
In the expansion of the Chinese market, the traditional promotion of physical storefronts has long been unable to grasp the hearts of consumers. Insight into the rise of online consumer power. In the first month of the ""Double 11"" start, Emmett partnered with Net Red on China's largest online shopping platform ""Taobao"", which opened a live broadcast at 8:00 every night, with a maximum record of 1 minute to sell. 6,000 electric fans.
Shi Ruibin also found the artist Jia Jingwen, the first spokesperson since the founding of Emmett. ""When the planning partner told me to find a spokesperson, the first time I was ""ah..."" three steps backwards, but after thinking for a few days, I decided to do it."" He analyzed that China's brand competition has reached the third. During the Warring States Period, ""we have seen the rise and fall of many brands since the founding of the company. How to continue to survive and find a way, ""brand renewal"" is very important.""
In the exhibition room, Jia Jingwen is striking and other high-profile human-shaped standing cards. The new mobile electric heater that she endorses is similar in appearance. It can avoid thermal expansion and contraction because it is formed without joints. ""This is very different from the industry in terms of craftsmanship."" With the use of graphene as a heating element to improve the drying of electric heaters and the habit of using humidifiers, Shi Ruibin said: ""You don't keep up with the times. It will be abandoned by the times.""

In August of this year, Shi Ruibin came to the industry as a professional manager Lin Yongchang as the executive general manager, actively deploying Southeast Asia, and contributing to revenue after two years of goal.
Younger brother, Eric's export business manager Shi Ruilin, who is also a research and development chief, likes to recruit new people's fundraising websites to explore new products. ""We grew up in the factory. The disadvantage is that the head is hard and the face is not wide enough."" Shi Ruilin said, ""My father is right. Emmett’s expectation is a century-old enterprise, and sustainable business does not necessarily require our brothers, or surnames to do it.""
When he mentioned his father, Shi Ruibin’s eyes were a little red. He described himself as always more emotional than rational. ""This (score) is given to my father in the spirit of heaven... In the future, if all the families of the mainland are big and small, they can have our goods. Wow, this is a very bad thing.""
