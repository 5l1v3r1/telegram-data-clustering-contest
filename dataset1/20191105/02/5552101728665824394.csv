【不只是二代店】不當靠媽族　她把一星粵菜港點搬進101
05 Nov 2019, 02:57 by 李莘于, 彭仁義
走進全新改裝的「台北101」美食地下街，也是米其林級小吃的激戰區，右有新加坡「了凡油雞飯麵」，左有香港「甘牌燒味」，各家無不大喇喇拉出布條、寫上招牌較勁。而系出米其林一星餐廳的「小三元」，卻安安靜靜，一個星級字眼都沒瞧見。
「今天怎麼沒帶你們家帥哥？」服務的阿姨親切和客人寒暄，順勢又加了熱茶。「很多客人都認出她，說：『咦，你不是以前301號包廂的阿姨嗎？』」小三元負責人、同時也是台北粵菜名店「大三元」第三代的吳珮菁笑說。有別於過去在大三元打扮貴氣，吳珮菁身著桃紅色大學T，相應整個空間粉嫩、明亮的氣息。











叱吒半世紀的大三元獲得米其林一星肯定，吳珮菁出來開店，卻不見光環籠罩。「當初出來開的條件就是不能用大三元做宣傳，也不能挖角現職員工，媽媽可能是想打消我的念頭。」
5年前吳珮菁加入家族事業，她的母親、大三元董事長邱靜惠逢人就介紹她是接班人，吳珮菁為大三元建置較有制度的訂位系統，購入高級Riedel酒杯來推廣搭配葡萄酒的餐酒會，讓老店更跟得上時代。
不過新生代的想法依然經常與老一代的管理階碰撞，母親希望她能將主力放在熟客經營，「打招呼、換名片、陪客人聊天是很有趣，但我不想只是我工作的唯一。」因此，當台北101找上門，即使限制重重，吳珮菁依然自籌資金，放手一搏。


























以港點為主打，除了因應百貨商場坪數小、出餐快的條件，「許多人都忘了大三元其實是台北第二家有推車港點的餐廳，我小學的時候老師們都常來店裡吃早茶。」吳珮菁特別向在大三元待了20多年的港點主廚陳建仁請益，延續老店的滋味之外，也開發獨家口味。如皮薄透亮的「黑松露蝦餃皇」就在澄皮和內餡都加入了義大利黑松露醬，內餡草蝦仁碩大鮮甜，松露味淡雅。因應蔬食風潮，新增口感爽脆的「貢菜鮮菇餃」及滑口的「嫩絲瓜腸粉」等素點，「曾有幾位印度商務客來，就狂點這幾道菜加楊枝甘露。」吳珮菁笑說。














搭配港點主題， 吳珮菁還特別與本土精釀品牌「啤酒頭」合作，推出現拉茶酒生啤。「吃港點就是飲茶，所以我選了以茉莉花茶風味的『小暑』來代表香片，再請他們以『凍檸茶』為概念來做一款小三元啤酒。」以南投蜜香紅茶為底釀製的啤酒，上桌前再加入檸檬片，酸爽沁涼，的確把嘴裡港點的濃味給帶走。對葡萄酒情有獨鍾的吳珮菁表示，近期也將開賣單杯粉紅酒，有一點份量卻不會過於厚重的粉紅酒，與海鮮、肉餡等旨味強烈的港點都能巧搭。
開幕邁入第三個月，生意穩步成長，媽媽現在怎麼看？「聽說她現在也會跟熟客提起我在信義區開了店...。」溫情不說出口，同樣倔強的母女倆，各自崗位守護老店招牌。

[Not just the second-generation shop] Improperly relying on the mother. She moved a star of the Cantonese cuisine port into 101.
05 Nov 2019, 02:57 by Li Yuyu, Peng Renyi
Entering the newly-modified ""Taipei 101"" gourmet underground street, it is also a fierce battle area for Michelin-class snacks. On the right, there is Singapore's ""Fan Chicken Noodle"", and on the left there is Hong Kong ""Gan Brand Siu Mei"". Put out the cloth and write the signboard. The ""small three yuan"" of the Michelin one-star restaurant was quiet, and no star-shaped words were seen.
""Why didn't you bring your handsome guy today?"" The aunt of the service was kind and cold, and added hot tea. ""A lot of guests recognized her and said, ""Hey, aren't you the aunts of the previous box No. 301?"""" Wu Xiaojing, the third generation of the ""three big yuan"" of Taipei's Cantonese restaurant. Different from the past in the big three yuan dress up, Wu Yujing dressed in the pink university T, the corresponding space pink, bright atmosphere.











In the half century, the big three yuan got a Michelin star, and Wu Jingjing came out to open the store, but did not see the aura. ""The conditions that came out at the beginning were that we could not use the big three yuan for propaganda, nor could we dig out the current employees. My mother might want to dispel my thoughts.""
Wu Jingjing joined the family business five years ago. Her mother, the chairman of the big Sanyuan, Qiu Jinghui, introduced her as a successor. Wu Jingjing built a more systematic reservation system for the big three yuan, and purchased a high-quality Riedel glass to promote wine matching. The dinner party will make the old store keep up with the times.
However, the new generation of ideas still often collide with the management of the older generation. The mother hopes that she can focus on the business of the regular customers. ""It is very interesting to say hello, change business cards, and chat with the guests, but I don't want to be the only one I work for."" When Taipei 101 came to the door, even if the restrictions were heavy, Wu Jingjing still raised funds and gave it a go.


























In Hong Kong, the main point is that in addition to the small number of department stores and fast meals, ""Many people have forgotten that the big three yuan is actually the second restaurant in Taipei with a stroller port. When I was in elementary school, the teachers. I often come to the store to have morning tea."" Wu Jingjing specially invited the chef of the Hong Kong-based chef, Chen Jianren, who had been in the big three yuan for more than 20 years, to continue the taste of the old store and develop exclusive flavors. For example, the ""black truffle shrimp dumplings"" with thin skin and bright skin are filled with Italian black truffle sauce in the crust and inner filling. The stuffing grass shrimp is large and sweet, and the truffle taste is elegant. In response to the trend of vegetable and food, the new ""Gourmet Mushroom Dumplings"" with crisp taste and the ""sweet loofah powder"" of the slippery mouth were added. ""A few Indian business guests came here, and they madly ordered these dishes. Yang Zhigan Lu."" Wu Xiaojing said with a smile.














In line with the theme of the port, Wu Jingjing also cooperated with the local brewing brand “Beer Head” to promote the draft beer. ""I eat tea at the port, so I chose the ""small summer"" with jasmine tea flavor to represent the scent, and then asked them to make a small ternary beer with the concept of ""frozen lemon tea""."" Brewed beer, add lemon slices before the table, sour and cool, and indeed take away the strong taste of the harbor. Wu Jingjing, who has a special liking for wine, said that she will also sell a single cup of pink wine in the near future. There is a little bit of pink wine that is not too heavy, and it can be combined with seafood and meat stuffing.
In the third month of the opening, the business grew steadily. What do moms think now? ""I heard that she will now tell me that I have opened a shop in Xinyi District..."" The warmth of the mother and the daughter, the same barely guarded the old store signs.
