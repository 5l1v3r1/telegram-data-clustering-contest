阿雅主持WeTV《奇遇人生2》帶領藝人卸下明星光環，突破自己舒適圈體驗不同生活。阿雅透露，這一季讓自己身體與心靈都到達了崩潰極限，錄了7期節目，有6期都在哭，但其實自己的哭點很高。
讓阿雅最印象深刻的是與馮紹峰前往英國，「他一坐上車就把帽子脫掉，透露自己在北京時不管都到哪都要把帽子壓得很低，不然就是一直被拍，好像做錯事一樣。」阿雅認為，藝人參與《奇遇人生2》錄製，自己首要任務就是要帶領他們學會自在與放鬆。
阿雅透露在節目時身心靈備受考驗，更在一次錄影聞訊好友在美國車禍過世，當場在路邊大哭，「一個人怎麼可以就這樣突然的沒了！」
她也在錄影中與Angelababy分享吊鋼絲經驗，讓Angelababy回憶起最膽戰心驚吊鋼絲經驗是在拍攝《痞子英雄》時，自己要在四層樓高的隔板跳下去，隔板還是透明的玻璃，往下看有如8層樓高，拍攝當晚颳風又下雨，自己是跟攝影師一起吊上去，「我是面朝下往下掉，嚇得我每上去一次都跟攝影師說，我再也不想上來了！」
