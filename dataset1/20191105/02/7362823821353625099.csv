“They are still friendly and spend time together in L.A. when Kate is there,” the source said. “There has been no drama. It’s just not Kate’s style. They have both had complicated schedules and have grown apart.”
Beckinsale, also known for her roles in ""Vacancy"" and ""The Aviator,"" was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Michael Sheen, with whom she has a 20-year-old daughter. Earlier this year, she was romantically linked to Pete Davidson of ""Saturday Night Live"" for four months.
