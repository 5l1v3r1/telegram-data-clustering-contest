      <p>New submitter <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/~paralumina01">paralumina01</a> shares a report from National Geographic: <i>In the blackness of space billions of miles from home, NASA's Voyager 2 marked a milestone of exploration, becoming just the second spacecraft ever to enter interstellar space in November 2018. Now, a day before the anniversary of that celestial exit, scientists have <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/interstellar-space-weirder-than-expected-nasa-voyager-2-reveals/">revealed what Voyager 2 saw as it crossed the threshold</a> -- and it's giving humans new insight into some of the big mysteries of our solar system. The findings, spread across five studies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0928-3">published</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0929-2">today</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0918-5">in</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0920-y">Nature</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0927-4">Astronomy</a>, mark the first time that a spacecraft has directly sampled the electrically charged hazes, or plasmas, that fill both interstellar space and the solar system's farthest outskirts. It's another first for the spacecraft, which was launched in 1977 and performed the first -- and only -- flybys of the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune. <br/>[...]<br/>For the first time, researchers could see that as an object gets within 140 million miles of the heliopause, the plasma surrounding it slows, heats up, and gets more dense. And on the other side of the boundary, the interstellar medium is at least 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hotter than expected. In addition, Voyager 2 confirmed that the heliopause is one leaky border -- and the leaks go both ways. Before Voyager 1 passed through the heliopause, it zoomed through tendrils of interstellar particles that had punched into the heliopause like tree roots through rock. Voyager 2, however, saw a trickle of low-energy particles that extended more than a hundred million miles beyond the heliopause. Another mystery appeared as Voyager 1 came within 800 million miles of the heliopause, where it entered a limbo-like area in which the outbound solar wind slowed to a crawl. Before it crossed the heliopause, Voyager 2 saw the solar wind form an altogether different kind of layer that, oddly, was nearly the same width as the stagnant one seen by Voyager 1.</i></p>
