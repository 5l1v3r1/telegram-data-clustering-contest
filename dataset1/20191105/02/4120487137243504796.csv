僧团带领信众顶礼药师宝忏



本山住持慧雄大师父洒净坛场



新加坡莲池阁寺-本山住持向信众佛法开示


 【本山讯】(雅加达-大丛山西禅寺) 10月26日，农历九月廿八日星期六上午，本山住持率僧团领导四众，纪念药师佛诞启建顶礼慈悲药师宝忏。是日上午，400多位信众参加修持药师忏法。主法和尚在礼忏休息时间给大家佛法开示：向诸佛菩萨顶礼忏悔，要生积极的心，不能向外求生起消极的心。当我们向内心观照，思维佛法，人无始以来造业深重，随无明烦恼习气做了无量无边的灾障。在犯错过程，首先我们一定要积极知道错误的缺点，要思维佛法改造，思维清净。如果我们用消极，只求忏悔，没有去思维过去以及现在改造自己的内心就生起不了清净心，发菩提心，证菩提果。没有生清净心的忏悔，只向外求的忏悔，消极的信仰会生起更多的无明烦恼。只要内心生清净，拥有慈悲以及智慧去思维，以悲愿的功德，您的发菩提心会一直不断的增长。 是日中午三卷药师宝忏庄严圆满。后，佛前大供，圆满忏赞五方佛，并送圣仪式。 按照汉传大乘传统佛教，农历九月廿九日是药师佛的大日子。本山住持前往新加坡莲池阁寺主持纪念法会，并修持药师忏法。休息期间向大家说明药师佛在因地未成佛前发了十二大宏愿，来修行行菩萨道。如今已经得到药师琉璃光如来的佛果，成就一切众生脱离生活上的苦恼。所以我们修持忏法，曾经犯过五逆十恶罪，用积极的心思维忏悔，斋戒沐浴，能得到药师琉璃光的悲愿，加持业障渐消除，烦恼证菩提，人间化为安乐国土。

The squad leader leads the believer



The abbot of the mountain, the master of Huixiong, sprinkles the mandala



Singapore's Lotus Pond Temple - Benshan's abbot reveals to the believers Dharma


[Benshan News] (Jakarta - Da Congshan Xichan Temple) On October 26th, the Saturday morning of the 28th day of the lunar calendar, the mountain's abbot rate led the group to commemorate the pharmacist's birth and celebrate the birth of the compassionate pharmacist Baodi. On the morning of the day, more than 400 believers took part in the practice of practicing pharmacists. The monk of the main law is to present to everyone the Dharma during the ceremonial rest time: to confess to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, to have a positive heart, not to ask for a negative heart. When we look at the inner heart and think about the Dharma, people have done a lot of work since the beginning, and they have done an infinite boundless disaster with the ignorance and habits. In the process of making mistakes, first of all, we must actively know the shortcomings of mistakes, and we must think about the transformation of Dharma and clear thinking. If we use negative, we only ask for remorse. If we don’t think about the past and reform our own heart, we will not be able to cleanse our minds, send bodhicitta, and prove Bodhi fruit. There is no confession of cherishing, only confession of outward seeking, and negative beliefs will produce more ignorance. As long as the inner heart is clean, with compassion and wisdom to think, and with the merits of sorrow, your Bodhicitta will continue to grow. It was a three-day pharmacist Baozheng solemnly completed at noon. Afterwards, the Buddha was given a large offering, and the five Buddhas were praised and sent to the ceremony. According to the Han Chuan Mahayana traditional Buddhism, the lunar calendar September 29th is the big day of the pharmacist Buddha. The abbot of Benshan went to the Lotus Pond Temple in Singapore to preside over the commemorative puja and practiced the pharmacist's law. During the break, I explained to you that the pharmacist Buddha had issued 12 major ambitions before he became a Buddha. Nowadays, I have obtained the Buddha fruit from the pharmacist's glazed light, which has made all sentient beings out of the distress of life. Therefore, we practiced the law of defamation, once committed the crime of rebellion against the ten evils, repented with positive heart, and bathed in fasting, and we were able to get the sorrow of the pharmacist glazed light, and the karma was gradually eliminated, and the troubles were bodhi, and human beings became the land of peace.
