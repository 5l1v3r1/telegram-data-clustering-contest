      <p><b>DGB Asia Bhd (+ve)</b><br/>TRADING of shares in DGB Asia Bhd (fundamental: 1.2/3, valuation: 0/3) triggered our momentum algorithm yesterday for the first time this year. The stock closed unchanged at 16 sen, with 29.5 million shares done, compared with its 200-day average volume of 1.94 million shares.</p>
      <p>For the third quarter ended June 30, 2019, the regional software and engineering solutions company’s net loss was RM4.47 million, from a net loss of RM711,000 for the previous year, due to higher operating costs and a higher share of loss from an associate. Its quarterly revenue jumped seven times to RM2.17 million, from RM302,000 previously, on higher value-added products sold.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months, DGB saw a net loss of RM7.88 million on a revenue of RM6.48 million. There were no comparative figures for the previous year as the group had changed its financial year.</p>
