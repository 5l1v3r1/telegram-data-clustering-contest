用數據解密消費者行為，智慧廣告將開啟行銷新模式：精準、效率、創意一次到位
05 Nov 2019, 02:00 by 廣編企劃


我們想讓你知道的是以數據驅動為核心的 DDC 動態創意廣告技術已成為新一代行銷利器，結合更加多元的媒體通路與廣告洞察創意，讓數位廣告精準、效率及創意的三個願望，都能一次滿足。



下雨天，看到乾爽潔白的產品令人爽快；大熱天，看到消暑解渴的產品讓人清涼。周一的中午，適合來點本周星座運勢；周五的傍晚，就點播一首歡樂的舞曲。
人的慾望與想法，常常隨著時空背景不同而有所變化；在面對受眾慾望與需求快速變化的現代，行銷戰的廣告策略，追求的早已不只是產品的大量曝光，而是更進一步地追求個性化與即時優化的廣告資訊。麥肯錫2016年的數據同樣地指出，提供適時、適地、適人的個人化訊息，不僅能使廣告成本下降近5成，更能提升近30%的廣告效益。
但為了實踐這個理想，背後意味著鎖定不同客群的文案、更多種配圖、甚至研究更多形形色色的消費情境；在每秒都在變動的數位環境下，行銷人還得花費心力針對每一個客製化廣告進行分析與檢討，幾乎成了不可能的挑戰。
所幸，在大數據與資料處理進步且迅速的智慧時代，DDC（Data Driven Creative）動態創意廣告技術讓我們得以探索夢想與未知之境，實踐智慧廣告的第一步。

在2019「數據為王-跨越理想到現實」高峰會中，SalesFrontier 成果行銷邀請The Trade Desk、Google、Verizon Media、家樂福等策略合作夥伴共同展示了DDC動態創意廣告技術，以及應用在實際案例中的成效。揭示了在智慧時代下，透過數據及新科技，再加上創意與消費者洞察，就能形成完美的「數據科學+商業分析」組合，發揮廣告的最大價值，也讓廣告不再干擾閱聽體驗，而是無痕融入消費者的消費歷程。
即時優化：讓數據幫你客製最佳廣告
過去，廣告素材往往需要透過猜測的方式，預想消費者喜好，再經過一系列前後測、A/B測試，才能夠拼湊出模糊的消費者輪廓，但在整個過程中，往往是曠日廢時、造成許多不必要的廣告資源浪費。
「過往的廣告行銷可能有一季的時間去規劃，直到結束再進行檢討分析，但成果行銷仰賴的是數據，就像是一個『科技農夫』，透過技術加上創意，快速的在數位廣告領域迭代創新。」成果行銷執行長陳建勳（Peter Chen）分享，基於現在豐富的數據環境，讓DDC動態創意廣告技術得以改善廣告業長久以來面臨的效率與成本問題。

所謂的DDC動態創意廣告技術，指的是以數據驅動作為核心，讓廣告能更加快速地被組合、驗證與優化的一套自動化系統。這套系統透過蒐集受眾資訊 ( 消費喜好、性別、購買歷程⋯⋯）與環境資訊 ( 天氣、地區、裝置型號⋯⋯) ，搭配資料表單與素材元件，即可自動生成一則適時、適地、適人的訊息，再透過即時的圖表化分析後台，讓廣告主能達到「即時辨識、即時投放、即時分析、即時修正」的效果。
「透過成果行銷DDC動態創意廣告技術的協助，數位廣告可以用半自動化的方式達到更有效率的成果，而我們最終目的就是希望能將『人』從繁複的日常作業中釋放出來，並在創意與策略上做出更多的價值。」成果行銷數據分析總監林志威（Edgar Lin）說。

不被流量綁架，用數據玩出行銷新模式
在流量紅利還存在的時候，不少企業都嚐過一夕爆紅的甜頭，但現在不僅社群廣告的價格逐年上漲、消費者的注意力也愈來愈分散，品牌必須藉由無所不在的數據作為洞察基底，才能為品牌做出更多元、更有價值的行銷新模式。
Google Marketing Platform總監張鈺東（Tony Chang） 認為，對消費者來說，廣告內容是否對自身有幫助，遠大於廣告出現在哪個位置，可惜的是，多數行銷人卻只花費10%的成本在素材發想上，「廣告素材非常重要，而數據就是素材與媒體最大的橋樑。」他以Audi的試駕活動為例，透過與天氣資訊的連結，邀請消費者在晴天時前來試駕，就能大大提高消費者對廣告的好感與到店率，這就是數據在廣告創意上的應用案例。

甚至，數據除了提供廣告創意之外，更能在DDC動態創意廣告技術下找出意想不到的潛在客群。
以家樂福2019年中元節的行銷活動為例，為了觸及到更多的年輕消費者，家樂福將迷信的風水祭拜與星座運勢加以連結，企圖把中元節塑造為更廣泛的「平安購物節」。為此，家樂福在成果行銷的DDC動態創意廣告技術下，分別針對不同星座、不同世代、不同性別與興趣的消費者分類，加上白天、晚上、晴天、雨天等環境因素客製化27個文案，再搭配不同底圖與尺寸，總共刊登了百餘種廣告素材。

由於DDC動態創意廣告技術能夠提供即時的回饋，因此家樂福可以隨時將成效不彰的素材撤換，減少廣告投放上的浪費；更可以加強反應好的素材，影響更多潛在消費者。在整個過程中，除了廣告點擊率提升了2至3倍外，更讓家樂福意外發現潛在的新客群。Edgar分析，「原先家樂福認為數位廣告主要在影響年輕族群，但因為廣告素材的多樣與客製化，讓他們意外找到未來可以持續耕耘的中年族群，這就是透過數據才能得到的消費者洞察。」
唯快不破：打造一條龍的數據服務
在這個分秒變化的世界中，數據已然成為廣告產業最關鍵的元素之一，更是讓廣告主得以快速創新的秘密武器。
為了幫助更多企業能夠迎接數據時代的新工具與觀念，成果行銷以一條龍的方式提供解決方案，從最基本的「埋代碼 ( Code )」幫助企業蒐集自身商業數據、到提供DDC動態創意廣告技術，再到即時、圖表化的分析後台，甚至還有專家提醒系統可以針對廣告投放給出明確建議；種種簡單化的廣告工具，目的就是希望能縮短過往行銷與IT技術之間的溝通落差。


以DDC技術作為強大的後盾，成果行銷今年更進一步推出「DCLab創新實驗室」，結合廣告科技、數據驅動、創意思考三位一體。Photo Credit: TNL Brand Studio

陳建勳期許：「成果行銷的長期目標，是希望幫助客戶省去一一研究數位行銷手法的時間，並提升品牌溝通訊息的效率與檢驗正確性，讓他們知道，擁抱新科技一點也不困難，只要找到對的方法及團隊，就能成功。」
在數據科技的輔助下，再加上廣告洞察創意，個人化廣告的應用不再遙不可及，成為下個世代中不可或缺的智慧行銷工具，更讓廣告精準、效率及創意的三個願望，都能一次滿足。

Results. It reveals that in the era of wisdom, through data and new technology, coupled with creativity and consumer insight, a perfect ""data science + business analysis"" combination can be formed to maximize the value of advertising and to prevent advertisements from interfering with listening. The experience, but the seamless integration into the consumer's consumption process.
Instant optimization: Let data help you customize the best ads
In the past, creatives often needed to guess consumers' expectations, and after a series of pre-tests and A/B tests, they were able to piece together fuzzy consumer profiles, but in the whole process, it was often a waste of time. , resulting in a lot of unnecessary waste of advertising resources.

The so-called DDC dynamic creative advertising technology refers to an automated system that uses data-driven as the core to enable advertising to be combined, verified and optimized more quickly. This system automatically generates a timely, appropriate and suitable person by collecting audience information (consumption preferences, gender, purchase history) and environmental information (weather, region, device model), with data forms and material components.

Not being kidnapped by traffic, using data to play a new marketing model
At the time when the traffic dividend still exists, many companies have tasted the sweetness of the red-hot, but now not only the price of social advertising has increased year by year, but consumers’ attention has become more and more dispersed. Brands must use ubiquitous data as a Investigate the base to create a new and more valuable marketing model for the brand.
Tony Chang, director of Google Marketing Platform, believes that for consumers, whether the content of the advertisement is helpful to them is far greater than where the advertisement appears. Unfortunately, most marketers only spend 10% of the cost on the material. In my mind, ""Creatives are very important, and data is the biggest bridge between materials and media."" He used Audi's test drive as an example to invite consumers to test drive on a sunny day through a link with weather information. It can greatly improve consumers' goodwill and store rate, which is the application case of data in advertising creativity.

In addition, in addition to providing advertising ideas, the data can find unexpected potential customers under DDC dynamic creative advertising technology.
Taking Carrefour's marketing activities in the 2019 Mid-Autumn Festival as an example, in order to reach more young consumers, Carrefour linked the superstitious Feng Shui worship to the horoscope, in an attempt to shape the Mid-Autumn Festival into a broader ""Safe Shopping Festival"". ""."" To this end, under the DDC dynamic creative advertising technology of the marketing of the results, Carrefour separately classifies consumers with different constellations, different generations, different genders and interests, plus daytime, evening, sunny, rainy and other environmental factors to customize 27 copywriting. With more than one basemap and size, a total of more than 100 kinds of creatives have been published.

Because DDC dynamic creative advertising technology can provide instant feedback, Carrefour can replace the ineffective materials at any time, reducing the waste of advertising; it can also strengthen the response to better materials and affect more potential consumers. In the whole process, in addition to the advertising click-through rate increased by 2 to 3 times, it also made Carrefour accidentally discover potential new customers. Edgar analyzed, ""The original Carrefour believed that digital advertising was mainly affecting young people, but because of the diversity and customization of creatives, they were surprised to find middle-aged people who could continue to work in the future. This is the consumer insight that can be obtained through data. ""
Just not breaking: building a one-stop data service
In this world of change, the data has become one of the most critical elements of the advertising industry, and it is the secret weapon for advertisers to innovate quickly.
In order to help more companies to meet the new tools and concepts in the data age, results marketing provides solutions in a one-stop way, from the most basic ""Code"" to help companies collect their own business data, to provide DDC dynamic creative advertising. Technology, to the real-time, graphical analysis of the back-end, and even the expert reminder system can give clear recommendations for advertising; a variety of simple advertising tools, the purpose is to reduce the communication gap between past marketing and IT technology.
