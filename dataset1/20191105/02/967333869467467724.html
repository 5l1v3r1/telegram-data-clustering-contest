        <b>China is exerting pressure on the Trump administration to remove tariffs Washington imposed in September and tariffs scheduled to go in effect in mid-December, before Beijing commits to the so-called Phase One of the bilateral trade deal, the US-based media reported earlier on Monday.</b>

      <blockquote>In particular, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f6580dc-ff53-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">Beijing demands that Washington</a> remove the 15-percent tariff the Trump administration imposed in September on $112 billion of Chinese goods. According to the Financial Times, the Trump administration is considering a rollback on certain levies - including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors - as a concession to seal a partial deal that would reportedly pause the trade war with Beijing as early as this month.</blockquote>
      <p>China reportedly seeks the tariffs’ removal in exchange for agreeing to purchase up to $50 billion worth of US agricultural goods, commit to open up its financial services sector to United States firms and increase intellectual property protections.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the United States <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910241077134313-major-reason-for-chinas-slowdown-is-tardy-pace-of-reforms-not-trumps-trade-war/">may withdraw its decision</a> to impose tariffs in December if Phase One goes well.</p>
      <p>On 13 October, US President Donald Trump announced that he had agreed in principle to Phase One of a trade deal with China’s Vice Premier Liu after high-level bilateral talks in DC</p>
      <p>Trump said the deal includes China agreeing to purchase up to $50 billion in US agricultural goods in addition to making reforms <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910161077064181-no-limit-huawei-sales-see-strong-growth-larger-global-5g-client-base-despite-us-trade-war-on-china/">concerning intellectual property</a> and financial services.</p>
      <p>The trade row between the world’s two largest economies erupted in June 2018 when the United States <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910071076978369-chinas-gold-bullion-scales-upwards-for-10th-straight-month-amid-us-trade-war-limbo/">imposed the first round of tariffs</a> on Chinese exports, prompting Beijing to respond in kind.</p>
      <p>Since then, the two countries have been engaged in a trade war, but have also started negotiations to resolve their trade-related differences.</p>
