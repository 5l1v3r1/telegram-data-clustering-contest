印度知名度最高的古蹟之一－－泰姬瑪哈陵（Taj Mahal），建造完工迄今已有366年歷史，每年吸引全球6、700萬遊客造訪，但大量遊客和印度各種汙染，也讓泰姬瑪哈陵美麗的模樣日益遭到破壞，近日印度決定斥資約新台幣百萬元，更換主要通道的地磚。
根據外媒《India Today》報導，印度普遍嚴重的工業汙染與空氣汙染，讓泰姬瑪哈陵蒙灰，加上每年湧進6、700萬名遊客造成的磨損和破壞，讓泰姬瑪哈陵逐漸失去了過往風采。
對此，印度考古調查局（ASI）盡可能採取各種措施防範，例如設置路障防止遊客伸手觸摸牆面或紀念碑，但對於遊客來往踩踏的地板卻無計可施。為了恢復泰姬瑪哈陵美感，印度考古調查局決定招標，更換通往圓頂主建築唯一通道的Chameli Farsh地板，估計約有400塊地磚。
更換的石磚主要是紅色砂岩，加上少部分大理石，尺寸從1至9平方英尺不等，石材則來自印度拉吉斯坦省（Rajasthan）的班西帕哈爾普爾（Bansi Paharpur），估計斥資220萬盧比（約新台幣94.7萬元）。整個工程預計將會持續到整個旅遊旺季，因此將對遊客和旅行社造成影響。
《中央社》報導指出，除了受到嚴重空汙和大量遊客影響外，泰姬瑪哈陵鄰近受汙染的亞穆納河（Yamuna River）飛來格萊德搖蚊（Goeldichironomus carus），在泰姬瑪哈陵牆面上留下綠黑色的糞便，使得原本白色的牆面成了黃褐色。
不過，比起印度其他地區，泰姬瑪哈陵的汙染情況已經算是好得多，相關單位已大舉關閉泰姬瑪哈陵周遭排放廢氣的工廠，也禁止附近農村燒牛糞，還在其方圓50公里設置無汙染區，禁止設立工廠，周圍500公尺也不得行駛汽車和柴油車，其周邊汙染也因此顯著下降。
