      <p>KARACHI (Dunya News) – Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto on Tuesday has expressed his concerns over the health of his father and former president Asif Ali Zardari. <br/><br/>In a post on social-networking website Twitter, the PPP leader said, “President Zardari has still not been given access to specialist doctors and personal physician. Our family is increasingly concerned about his health.”<br/><br/>If anything happens to our father this government will be held responsible, he warned.</p>

      <p>Earlier, while taking in view the health condition of Zardari, the PPP leadership had written an application to form private medical board for the checkup of ex-president. <br/><br/>PPP’s application stated that doctors have pointed out Zardari’s severe health issues, adding that uncontrolled sugar level can create problems for him. Government doctors also suggested to get help from a neurologist, the application told. <br/><br/>The PPP said that getting proper medical care is basic and legal right of every prisoner. </p>
