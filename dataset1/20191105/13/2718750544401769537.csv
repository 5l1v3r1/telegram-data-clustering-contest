05 Nov 2019, 13:11 by Zoe Haylock
Vanessa Hudgens is back in a musical and it’s not High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. According to Deadline, Hudgens, X-Men actress Alexandra Shipp, and Tony nominee Robin de Jesús have all been cast in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Netflix adaptation of Tick, Tick … Boom!, a musical by Jonathan Larson set in the 1990s. They join Andrew Garfield, who has already been cast as the musical’s autobiographical protagonist, Jon, a struggling theater composer who’s about to hit the big three-oh. He faces pressure from his girlfriend, Susan (Shipp), and his best friend, Michael, has already given up his hopes for a creative, high-paying job. Jonathan Larson eventually wrote the Broadway hit Rent, but died before the musical’s first Off Broadway performance. Hudgens played Maureen in a live television broadcast of Rent, de Jesús has multiple Tony nominations, and Shipp played Aaliyah in a biopic. Andrew Garfield better get working on those vocals!
