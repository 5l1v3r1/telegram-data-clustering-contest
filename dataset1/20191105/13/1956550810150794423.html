      <p><a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">Looking for things to do in Dubai?</a><br/><br/>How about a brand new night at a brand new <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars">bar</a>?</p>
      <p>Global party brand Candypants has teamed up with brand-spanking new <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/402534-dubais-best-beach-bars-2019">beach bar</a> <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/421083-first-look-at-bungalow-la-mers-new-licensed-venue">Bungalow </a>– <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/aroundtown/features/80258-the-essential-guide-to-dubais-la-mer">La Mer’s newest licensed venue</a> – for its latest night.</p>
      <p>Describe as “surfer’s dream meets chic <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/402492-dubais-best-sports-bars-2019">sports bar</a>”, the Candypants Surfside Sports Club will be held every Monday from 5pm until 2am and promises to be the ultimate hangout for “<a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing">sportsmen</a> and cheerleaders alike”.</p>
      <p>It kicks off with the 'home run <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/happy-hours/386863-dubai-happy-hours-2018-best-bar-deals-offers-and-discounts">happy hour</a>' from 5pm until 8pm with 50 percent off hops, grape and short measures.</p>
      <p>Continue the evening from 8pm until 11pm with either the Sportsman’s Package of unlimited hops, nibbles and shisha for Dhs199 or the Sportswoman’s Package, which includes free-flowing mixed drinks, nibbles and shisha for Dhs99.</p>
      <p>Want to be crowned the Surfside Sports Club champion?</p>
      <p>Head down with your most gluttonous mate and if you can both polish off a massive surfboard of bites under 90 minutes, it’s on the house. Fail the monster of an eating challenge and it’ll cost you Dhs550.</p>
      <p>The challenge involves wolfing down 12 mixed <a href="http://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/395744-dubais-best-wings-deals-2019">wings</a>, three burgers, one pizza, two quesadillas, three different types of edamame, nachos, calamari and fries. One for the braver guests, we’ll say.</p>
