      <h3>Stefano Sensi sparks speculations about his future as his agent, Giuseppe Riso, visits Barcelona.</h3>
      <p>With agent Guiseppe Riso in Barcelona, many speculate the young Italian to join the Spanish Giants. According to<a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/355606/calciomercato_inter_agente_sensi_diretto_a_barcellona_ultime_cm_it"><b> calciomercato.it</b></a>, this could also open the possibility of Rakitic or Arthuro Vidal joining Inter Milan in an exchange offer.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has been previously linked with the defending La Liga champions which many believe was a key operation to bring Ivan Rakitic to Inter as coach Antonio Conte is very much interested in the services of the Croatian. Riso’s presence in the Spanish city brings him closer to joining the club with Rakitic and Vidal both being options for an exchange negotiation.</p>
      <p>The Italian youngster is known to be a complete player who is intelligent on and off the ball, which makes him a good addition to the Barca squad.</p>
      <p>With the upcoming January transfer market almost live, the Catalans may look to accelerate their interest in the Italian.</p>
      <p>Although the reasons for Riso’s trip are unknown, if he does direct Sensi’s future towards Barca, with the lack of minutes received by both Rakitic and Vidal this season under Valverde, their futures hang in the balance.</p>
      <p>What are your thoughts on seeing Stefano Sensi in a Blaugrana shirt?</p>
