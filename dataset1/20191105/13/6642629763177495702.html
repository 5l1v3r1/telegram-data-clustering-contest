      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>'s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that negotiations on a future trading relationship with<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html"> Britain</a> would be "difficult and demanding", as the bloc "will not tolerate unfair competitive advantage".</p>
      <p>"The UK should not think that zero tariffs, zero quotas will be enough," he said in a speech on Tuesday during Europe's largest tech event, the Web Summit, in Lisbon, adding that time would also be "extremely short" to negotiate a new partnership.</p>
      <p>"I know this negotiation will be difficult and demanding," he said, listing state aid, social and environmental rights and taxes as top priorities for the European Commission.</p>
      <p>"Even when the [<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a>] deal is ratified it will not be the end of the story ... We have to build a new partnership with the UK after they withdraw," he said, reiterating his view that the risk of Britain's chaotic departure without a divorce agreement still existed.</p>
