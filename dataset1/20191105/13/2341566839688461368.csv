對台26項措施 蔡總統：中國已定調一國兩制

（中央社記者郭芷瑄屏東縣5日電）總統蔡英文今天表示，不論是中國先前提出對台31項措施，或現在提出26項，都是在中國的一國兩制台灣方案脈絡裡提出，用意很清楚，就是中國已定調一國兩制。
蔡總統上午在屏東縣出席高雄榮民總醫院屏東大武分院動土典禮接受媒體聯訪表示，中國現在全力推動（26項措施），就是為實現對台灣的一國兩制方案，且在大選期間提出，用意很自然讓人想到是意圖影響選舉。
中國國務院台灣事務辦公室4日公布對台「26項措施」，包括台資企業可同等參與中國重大技術裝備、5G等投資建設共13條，其餘13條為台灣民眾在領事保護、文化體育等方面提供更多便利和支持。
至於台美首度共同舉辦國際網路演練，蔡總統表示，政府各部門一直關切資安，這段時間做了很多努力，牽涉國家安全，會跟相關國家一起努力，讓國安不出現漏洞。選舉期間會有很多假訊息或網路攻擊，政府也在建立系統，讓民主不被假訊息和網路攻擊攻破。
媒體也詢問有關中國國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜到桃園市向警察局借廁所卻遭拒說法，蔡總統說，警方有說明與影像，這件事沒問題，但韓國瑜第一時間說警方有幫忙，後來又改口，常常講話都改口，這習慣不好。
至於韓國瑜公開在家洗衣服影片，蔡總統表示，在家裡做的事本來就很平常，但為何公布，難以理解，人民較希望看到韓國瑜在高雄市議會答詢。
韓國瑜陣營稱11月中旬絕對有機會扳平民意調查差距，蔡總統表示，她不知道民調還能預告，民調不是重點，重點應是一言一行是否該受到信任。（編輯：李明宗）1081105
