      <h2>Infiniti will soon have a new 'Bionic Cheetah' on the prowl as it teases a new coupe crossover: the QX55.</h2>

      <p><b>Infiniti</b> invented the coupe crossover with the muscular <b>FX/QX70</b>, which it nicknamed the “Bionic Cheetah”. It’s been discontinued from overseas markets and will soon be withdrawn from Australia, but Infiniti has a new coupe crossover coming to fill the void, the <b>QX55</b>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/x3/">BMW X3</a>-sized <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/infiniti/qx50/">QX50</a> upon which the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/infiniti-qx55/">QX55</a> is based is a handsome, contemporary SUV but it lacks the visual dynamism of the outgoing <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/infiniti/qx70/">QX70</a>.</p>
      <p>The QX55, therefore, takes the QX50’s bones and adds more exuberant styling. It'll reach North American showrooms from mid-2020.</p>
      <p>The roofline is steeply raked aft of the C-pillar and there’s the subtlest hint of a notchback in the car’s silhouette. Overall, the QX55 is rather more reminiscent of a high-riding hatchback than a lifted sedan or wagon. In that respect, it’s more akin to an <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/audi/q8/">Audi Q8</a> than a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes-benz/glc-coupe/">Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe</a>.</p>

      <p>You’ll notice, too, that the C-pillar treatment much more closely resembles the old QX70 than any newer Infiniti passenger cars or SUVs, almost all of which feature Infiniti’s unique “crescent-cut” C-pillar treatment.</p>
      <p>The QX55 will be one of the last Infinitis designed by outgoing Infiniti design chief <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/karim-habib/">Karim Habib</a>, who left the company earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Overall, the QX55 does a pretty convincing impression of the QX70. Though that SUV’s current iteration was launched in some markets just over a decade ago, its styling has aged well and is arguably more harmonious than some subsequent coupe crossovers.</p>

        <i>Above: Infinti QX70.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Where the QX55 differs markedly from the old QX70 is in its drivetrain. As it’s based on the QX50, it uses a front- and all-wheel-drive platform, not a rear- and all-wheel-drive one.</p>
      <p>There’s no raspy V6 or grunty V8 either, as the QX55 will almost certainly retain the QX50’s <b>2.0-litre variable-compression turbocharged four</b> mated to a <b>continuously variable transmission</b>.</p>
      <p>In the QX50, the trick 2.0-litre produces <b>200kW</b> and <b>390Nm</b>.</p>
      <p>The new naming convention echoes BMW’s delineation of sedans/wagons and their coupe siblings, though it’s unclear whether Infiniti will follow this convention with future passenger cars – by this new logic, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/infiniti/q60/">Q60</a> coupe should be a Q55.</p>
      <h3>Australia</h3>
      <p>No QX55 for us. No QX50 either. Infiniti has (almost) left the building, the company announcing earlier this year that it’ll <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/788699/infiniti-to-exit-australia/">stop selling cars in Australia</a> by late 2020.</p>
