      <p>(CNN) - Steve Easterbrook resigned from Walmart's board a day after announcing his exit from McDonald's.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook informed Walmart on Monday that he was stepping down from its board of directors effective immediately, according to a regulatory filing. The departure follows his dismissal as CEO of the fast food chain for having a consensual relationship with a McDonald's employee.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook joined Walmart's board of directors in 2018. He sat on committees that focused on management development and finance.</p>
      <p>Walmart said his resignation "was not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices."</p>
      <p>Walmart didn't have an additional comment beyond the regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook had been McDonald's CEO since 2015. The company said in a statement that he "demonstrated poor judgment involving a recent consensual relationship with an employee." He called the relationship a "mistake" and agreed with the company's decision.</p>
      <p>Chris Kempczinski, the president of McDonald's USA, replaced Easterbrook as CEO.</p>
