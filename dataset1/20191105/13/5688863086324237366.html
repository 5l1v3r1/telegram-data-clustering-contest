      <p>Australia cricket team continued their recent dominance at home in T20 Internationals after overcoming Pakistan in the 2nd T20I at the Manuka Oval in Canberra on Tuesday. <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a> scored an unbeaten 80* as Australia went through Pakistan with nine balls to spare. Earlier in the day, Pakistan managed to post a total of 150/6 after Captain Babar Azam won the toss and elected to bat.</p>
      <p>This was Pakistan’s first game after the sacking of former captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sarfaraz">Sarfaraz</a> Ahmed as the first T20I in Sydney was washed out. Skipper Azam led from the front scoring a magnificent half-century as the other batsmen failed to get going. Iftikhar Ahmed added late fireworks including smashing <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kane_richardson">Kane Richardson</a> for 22 runs in the penultimate over to take Pakistan to a respectable 150/6. Iftikhar remained unbeaten on 62*. </p>
      <p>Australia’s run chase was kick-started by <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/david_warner">David Warner</a> as he smashed four boundaries in an over of Imad Wasim. Warner, who remained unbeaten throughout the series against Sri Lanka, got dismissed after <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_amir">Mohammad Amir</a> got the better him. Australia Captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/aaron_finch">Aaron Finch</a> soon followed as Smith continued his stellar form as he continued to pierce gaps on the field en-route a scintillating half-century. Skipper Aaron Finch praised his team, especially the Man of the Match, Smith.</p>
      <p>“Very pleasing. We were very good today. Getting wickets consistently was pleasing. Got guys like Steve, who does what he does best. I think at times our execution at the death could have been better. The shots that me and Davey played also weren't great either,” Finch was quoted by saing by Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>Smith's undefeated 80 off 51 balls neutralised the impact of Azam and big-hitter Ahmed to guide the hosts to a seven-wicket win. And the MoM was happy to have got the job done for his team.</p>
      <p>“Nice to be there till the end and see the boys home. The bowlers bowled beautifully. It was a slower ball and it took the edge of the bat to go on to the leg-side (referring to his uppercut). As a batter that's the plan to get under their (the bowlers') nerves. You try to find a way as a batter and do it to the best of your abilities,” Smith said.</p>
