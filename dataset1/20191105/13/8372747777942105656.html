      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Lee County commissioners have voted to expand bacteria testing in our waterways.</p>
      <p>Florida Atlantic University will conduct the study and analyze the results.</p>
      <p>The goal is to find the source of the human waste bacteria.</p>
      <p>The county has discussed changing from a septic system to a sewer system, so they want to make sure there's data to back up that science.</p>
      <p>"The idea of switching from septic to sewer is extremely expensive. We want to make sure if we go down that road, we are doing it in the right areas, because it costs so much," says Commissioner Brian Hamman.</p>
      <p>The study will take approximately 18 months to complete.</p>
