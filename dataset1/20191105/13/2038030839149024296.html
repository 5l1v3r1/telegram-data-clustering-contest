      <p>One of Keanu's last serious (public) romances was with David Lynch's assistant, Jennifer Syme.</p>
      <p>The couple met in 1998 and conceived a child one year later.</p>
      <p>However, while Keanu was filming one of his most famous blockbusters, <i>The Matrix</i>, the child named Ava Archer Symes-Reeves, was stillborn.</p>
      <p>The couple broke up a few weeks later. Then tragically a year and a half later in 2001, Jennifer died in a car accident. She was 28 years old. </p>
