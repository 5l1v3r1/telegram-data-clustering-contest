KARACHI (Dunya News) – Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto on Tuesday has expressed his concerns over the health of his father and former president Asif Ali Zardari. In a post on social-networking website Twitter, the PPP leader said, “President Zardari has still not been given access to specialist doctors and personal physician. Our family is increasingly concerned about his health.”If anything happens to our father this government will be held responsible, he warned.



Earlier, while taking in view the health condition of Zardari, the PPP leadership had written an application to form private medical board for the checkup of ex-president. PPP’s application stated that doctors have pointed out Zardari’s severe health issues, adding that uncontrolled sugar level can create problems for him. Government doctors also suggested to get help from a neurologist, the application told. The PPP said that getting proper medical care is basic and legal right of every prisoner. 
 
On October 22, 2018, Zardari was brought to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from Adiala jail and admitted to the cardiology department’s VIP ward.
The former president had complaints of backache, weakness and anxiety.
