被邀唱歌一臉懵 張家輝：不知道我是演員嗎？

05 Nov 2019, 13:29

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】香港影帝張家輝日前因宣傳主演的新片《催眠·裁決》，在某活動上受邀獻唱歌曲。沒想到，作為演員的他，唱歌也非常好聽，普通話也聽起來很標準。而他在現場和大家開玩笑，顯得一臉懵地說：「不知道我為什麼會被邀請來唱歌，難道沒人知道我是個演員嗎？」逗樂全場。
由張家輝等主演的《催眠·裁決》正在中港兩地上映。影片講述，催眠專家許立生（張家輝 飾）被匪徒以女兒性命作威脅，要求其在90分鐘內催眠至少四位陪審團成員逆轉審判結果，許立生絕地反擊，暗中聯手前特種兵楊凱展開限時營救。這也是張家輝繼《大追捕》、《激戰》之後再次出演父女題材的電影。
據陸媒報導，為宣傳新片，張家輝近期與一眾主創在多個城市舉辦活動。在現場，張家輝受邀獻唱歌曲，歌唱水平獲得好評。而他也在現場和大家開起了玩笑，說他很想不通，自己明明是個演員，不知道為什麼會被邀請來唱歌。
不過他也表示，好在自己唱歌也不錯。觀眾也被他這番話逗樂，他還表示，希望以後還有機會再唱歌給大家聽。
很多網友留意到，現場唱著國語歌的張家輝不僅唱得很好聽，普通話也非常標準，於是紛紛留言調侃：「張家輝不愧是張學友的『親弟弟』！」
在新片中演繹「催眠專家」的張家輝，也在現場重現了以一敵六的電影劇情，引得台下觀眾陣陣驚呼。觀影後，有觀眾說自己被張家輝扮演的催眠大師許立生感動，主動邀請張家輝現場催眠。張家輝笑說：「你這麼喜歡我，其實就是被我催眠啦。」
張家輝的普通話一直是大陸網民的笑料，他曾因自我介紹時發音不清楚而獲得「渣渣輝」的外號，因此私下苦練普通話，希望能給自己「爭口氣」。他在現場頗為自信地問觀眾和記者：「你們還取笑我的普通話嗎？」說話的架勢顯然是有備而來，引得全場一片笑聲。
不過，他還是把「取笑」說成了「取消」，也渾然不覺發音有偏差。搞笑的是，現場的觀眾和記者都不忍心「打擊」張家輝，齊聲說「不取笑」。張家輝聽到這善意的「謊言」，顯得十分滿意，向大家送飛吻。
而看到視頻的網友並沒有那麼多顧慮，都留言調侃：「不取消不取消（不取笑），知道你過得不容易。」「你女兒都『取消（取笑）』你的普通話啦。」
張家輝2017年在某次廣告代言中自我介紹時說：「大家好，我是張家輝。」他說的「張家輝」三個字因發音不標準，聽起來很像「渣渣輝」，於是這一稱呼就此傳開，演變為大陸網民對他的親切稱呼。
雖然「渣渣輝」這個「梗」算是過不去了，不過也因為這個「梗」，讓張家輝在憑演技之外又獲得一波粉絲。

Was invited to sing a face Zhang Jiahui: Do you know that I am an actor?

05 Nov 2019, 13:29

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Hong Kong movie star Zhang Jiahui was invited to sing songs at an event because of his new film ""Hypnosis and Judgment"". Unexpectedly, as an actor, he sang very well, and Mandarin sounded very standard. While he was joking at the scene, he looked sly and said: ""I don't know why I was invited to sing. Doesn't anyone know that I am an actor?""
The Hypnosis Award, starring Zhang Jiahui and others, is being released in China and Hong Kong. The film tells that the hypnosis expert Xu Lisheng (Zhang Jiahui) was threatened by the gangsters with his daughter's life and asked him to hypnotize at least four jury members in 90 minutes to reverse the trial results. Xu Lisheng countered the attack and secretly joined forces with the former special forces Yang Kai to carry out limited time rescue. This is also the film that Zhang Jiahui once again appeared in the theme of father and daughter after ""Hidden Hunt"" and ""Guild War"".
According to the Lu Media report, in order to promote the new film, Zhang Jiahui recently held activities in several cities with a group of masters. At the scene, Zhang Jiahui was invited to sing songs, and the singing level was well received. He also made a joke at the scene and said that he couldn't figure out that he was an actor. He didn't know why he was invited to sing.
However, he also said that it is good to sing himself. The audience was also amused by his words. He also said that he hopes that there will be a chance to sing to everyone later.
Many netizens noticed that Zhang Jiahui, who sang a Mandarin song on the spot, not only sang very well, but also had a standard Mandarin. So he commented: ""Zhang Jiahui is not a ""brother"" of Jacky Cheung!""
Zhang Jiahui, who performed the ""hypnosis expert"" in the new film, also recreated the movie plot with an enemy six, which attracted the audience to exclaim. After watching the movie, some viewers said that they were touched by Xu Lisheng, the hypnosis master played by Zhang Jiahui, and invited Zhang Jiahui to hypnotize on the spot. Zhang Jiahui said with a smile: ""You like me so much, it is actually hypnotized by me.""
Zhang Jiahui's Mandarin has always been a joke of mainland netizens. He used to get the nickname of ""Slag"" because he was unclear when he introduced himself. Therefore, he practiced Putonghua privately and hoped to give himself a ""sigh of relief."" He asked the audience and reporters quite confidently at the scene: ""Do you still make fun of my Mandarin?"" The posture of the speech is obviously prepared, and the audience laughed.
However, he still referred to ""punishing"" as ""cancellation"" and he did not feel that there was a deviation in pronunciation. The funny thing is that the audience and reporters at the scene are not willing to ""strike"" Zhang Jiahui and say ""no teasing"" in unison. When Zhang Jiahui heard this kind of ""lie"", he was very satisfied and sent a kiss to everyone.
The netizens who saw the video did not have so much concern. They all commented on the message: ""Do not cancel without canceling (not making fun), knowing that you are not easy."" ""Your daughter is ""cancel (puddle)"" your Mandarin.""
In 2017, Zhang Jiahui said in a self-introduction to a commercial endorsement: ""Hello everyone, I am Zhang Jiahui."" The three words ""Zhang Jiahui"" he said are not like the standard pronunciation. It sounds like ""slag"", so this The title spreads and it evolved into a friendly name for mainland netizens.
Although the ""stalk"" of ""slag slag"" is too much to pass, but because of this ""stalk"", Zhang Jiahui has won a wave of fans in addition to acting.
