      <h1>Mali’s president says existence of his country at risk after deadly jihadist attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:25:54+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Will Brown</a></address>
      <p>Mali's president has warned the very existence of his country is at risk after an attack by Islamic State militants killed at least 49 soldiers. </p>
      <p>President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta has declared three days of mourning after the attack last Friday on an army base in Indelimane, in the northeast of the country.</p>
      <p>Fighters overran the base, killed the troops and posed in videos afterwards with looted heavy weaponry and military vehicles.   </p>
      <p>“The stability and existence of our country are at stake, our only response must be national unity … around our national army,” Mr Keïta said on national television on Monday night.   </p>
      <p>The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) claimed the massacre and another IED explosion which killed a French soldier on Saturday.  </p>
      <p>While Islamic State (Isil) has been largely defeated in the Middle East, the group’s cousin in the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/06/uk-troops-sent-africas-jihadist-belt-fight-extremism-migration/"> Sahel, a vast arid region running underneath the Sahara</a>, is going from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks Mali has suffered repeated attacks on its military. Last month, jihadists allied to al-Qaeda killed at least 40 troops near the border with Burkina Faso.</p>
      <p>Mali’s conflict began in late 2012 when jihadists and ethnic-Tuareg separatists, heavily armed with weapons from Libya’s civil war, surged out of the Sahara desert and took over the northern half of the country. </p>
      <p>France, the former colonial power, intervened in early 2013. With the help of around 2,000 Chadian troops, French forces drove the fighters out of northern towns like Timbuktu.</p>
      <p>The UN launched a mission with over 10,000 blue helmets and France has permanently stationed some 4,500 troops across the Sahel. </p>
      <p>But international troops have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/terror-and-security/mali-witnesses-disturbing-rise-child-deaths-injuries-due-conflict/">not been able to stop the insecurity spreading</a>. Jihadist groups and ethnic militias have proliferated and<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/06/10/tribal-militia-kills-150-mali-islamist-insurgency-intensifies/"> fighting has spread into Mali’s populous central regions</a> and into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>
      <p>Many security analysts fear the violence could spread south into countries like Ivory Coast, Togo and Benin.</p>
      <p>Both the UN and France are deeply unpopular among Malians who see them as incapable of protecting them. </p>
      <p>In the address, Mr Keïta reaffirmed his support for the international forces saying that they were “more [necessary] than ever”.  </p>
