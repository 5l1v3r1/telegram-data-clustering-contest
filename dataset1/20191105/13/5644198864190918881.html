      <p>TOKYO: In a country notorious for overwork, Microsoft Japan trialled a radical idea – working less. And it found <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/four-day-work-week-and-how-to-make-it-happen-realistic-11945778">that four-day weeks</a> and other reforms both boosted sales and cut costs.</p>
      <p>The Japanese unit of the US IT giant closed its offices every Friday in August, giving all 2,300 full-time workers special leave.</p>

      <p>It also restricted meetings to a maximum of 30 minutes, and encouraged online chats as an alternative to face-to-face communications.</p>
      <p>The number of participants at meetings was limited to five, and workers were also encouraged to use online communication instead of emails, it said.</p>
      <p>The results were positive, with sales per employee rising almost 40 per cent in August from a year earlier, electricity consumption down by a quarter and paper usage being cut in half.</p>

      <p>The firm said the trial showed "employees want to have a variety of ways of working" and that adopting the model more broadly could boost efficiency.</p>
      <p>It plans to launch a similar programme this winter - but won't offer special leave.</p>
      <p>Instead, employees will be encouraged to use their existing holiday days, it said.</p>
      <p>The programme comes as Japan's government pushes for more "flexible work styles," urging business to accept telecommuting, different part-time schedules and off-peak commuting.</p>
      <p>The effort is part of an attempt to address the issue of "karoshi" - death from overwork - and to encourage overworked and overburdened couples to have children in a country that is struggling with a shrinking population.</p>
