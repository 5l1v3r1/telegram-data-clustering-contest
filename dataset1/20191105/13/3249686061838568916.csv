BTS V's Singularity continues to be a viral topic in K-media - ""Black Swan performance"" still trends hot
05 Nov 2019, 13:55 by newsforkpop



It has been more than a year since Kim Taehyung aka Vof BTS released his solo ""Singularity"" and still even today, the song continues to enchant and dazzle new viewers and is gaining more and more fans.
BTS V's solo stage during the SY: Final tour was phenomenal. It almost felt like a musical starring Kim Taehyung and his entire performance felt that way. He was so good in it that multiple reporters covering the final tour commented on his dance style and the way he was emoting the lyrics so well. It was as if a drama was unfolding on the stage!



Even the entertainment channel KBS covered his final Singularity stage and picked it as the highlight performance of the tour.



Singularity music video itself is a treat to view- anyone who has ever seen the mv never fails to comment on how much soul BTS V has put in it and how it gives off an RnB style vibe and feel which is very different from the usual K-pop songs. One of the new reactors even mentioned that BTS V has more soul in his songs than even the western RnB artists do!



Singularity is one of BTS V's most iconic songs and the final stage for it will forever be immortalized as one of the greatest stages in K-pop history. It spawned so many nicknames for BTS V like ""Black Swan"", ""Hades"" and even ""Howl"". Truly, a dazzling finish to a very well-deserving song.
