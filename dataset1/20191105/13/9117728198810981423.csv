Gary Lineker: Lewis Hamilton is ""arguably"" Britain's greatest-ever sports person
05 Nov 2019, 13:30 by Bobby Vincent

Former England football striker Gary Lineker has heaped the praise on Lewis Hamilton after the British driver picked up his sixth world title on Sunday, calling on the Mercedes driver to be knighted.

Lineker said it is ""extraordinary"" how Hamilton hasn't already been knighted and called the six-time world champion ""arguably our greatest-ever sportsperson"" via his personal Twitter account.
It's a massive claim from Lineker, but certainly one many would agree with. Hamilton has now won three Drivers' titles on the bounce, with Nico Rosberg the last man to stop him back in 2016.
Hamilton made his Formula 1 debut back in 2007 in Australia for McLaren; since then, he has won 83 times and Sunday's race in the USA was his 150th podium in F1, scoring 3399 points along the way.
