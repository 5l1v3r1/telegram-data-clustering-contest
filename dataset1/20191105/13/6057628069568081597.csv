US withdraws from the Paris agreement
05 Nov 2019, 13:56 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

The United States officially told the United Nations its withdrawal from the global warming agreement in Paris. Already many world leaders have begun to express their concerns about the US action.

US President Donald Trump has pledged to pull his country out of the deal despite strong evidence of the devastating effects of global warming.
In a letter to the United Nations, the US government said it would withdraw from the treaty on November 4, 20, a day after the US presidential election, which President Trump hopes to extend.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized Trump's claim that the Paris deal would jeopardize U.S. trade.
Already, French President Emmanuel Macron, who has tried to convince Trump to continue to respect the agreement, expresses his concern, while Russia says the withdrawal of the United States is a violation of the agreement.
China has also expressed concern at President Xi Jinping's expected signing a climate change agreement with Macron.
