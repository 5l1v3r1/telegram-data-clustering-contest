      <h1>Wishaw shop is refused permission to extend its hours to sell alcohol by licensing board</h1>
      <h2>Maxton Stores in Coltness had made an application to the council</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:09:18+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>A bid to expand a Wishaw store’s alcohol licence has been thrown out by the council.</p>
      <p>The local authority’s Licensing Board refused the proposals from Maxton Stores in Coltness, pictured following a lengthy meeting.</p>
      <p>The bid from the store, based in Maxton Crescent, to expand its ability to sell booze from within its shop was opposed by members of Coltness Community Council.</p>
      <p>The group’s chairman John Carr spoke to the Board regarding its reasons for opposing the application.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “If the application had been granted then it would have massively increased the floorspace for the store to sell drink.</p>
      <p>“We know from speaking to police that Maxton Crescent can be a hotspot for antisocial behaviour so we thought this would be a step too far.</p>
      <p>“What would be the benefit to Coltness?</p>
      <p>“The area is already saturated with shops which are able to sell drink.”</p>
      <p>Last month, police told a meeting of the community council that crime had decreased by a whopping 42 per cent compared with the same period 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>PC Alan Brown, from Wishaw Police Office, told that meeting: “We have also only had 100 calls to police in the past month compared to 206 the previous year. That is a significant reduction.”</p>
      <p>Speaking this week, John Carr added: “At the moment we are not getting as much antisocial behaviour but that’s only because of efforts from a number of different agencies.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping that this trend continues in the coming months.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can draw a line under this and now move forward.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A North Lanarkshire Council spokesperson confirmed the plans had not been granted.</p>
      <p>She said: “The Licensing Board considered an application for a Variation of Licensed Premises from Maxton Stores at its meeting on Friday, October 25.</p>
      <p>“An objection was submitted by the community council.</p>
      <p>“Following a hearing, the Board decided to refuse the application.”</p>
      <p>The Wishaw Press made several attempts to contact Maxton Stores. However, no comment was received at the time of going to print.</p>
