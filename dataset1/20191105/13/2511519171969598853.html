      <p>A husband discovered his wife dead in the bathroom after she was attacked by their pet Great Danes, it has been reported. </p>
      <p>Mary Matthews’s body was discovered in her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ohio">Ohio</a> home, where the two <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Dogs">dogs</a> were found locked outside on the patio.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old had suffered multiple injuries and officers found evidence of blood throughout the property in Clearcreek Township, near Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Mark Matthews returned home on the afternoon of 1 November to find his wife dead, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/05/us/ohio-woman-killed-by-dogs/index.html?utm_source=fbCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2019-11-05T10%3A17%3A30&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwAR22PLqQrIYoDxhrvuHdnfvX6WCLdFqHSEH6yIDBpTuXITQtCdpD9mlq70w&amp;fbclid=IwAR190Ss8pc_HCXcY8rPLXODsVtnMJbcuT5cMAxQH_-Vt0hdo7uI83s7um8U">CNN</a> reported. </p>
      <p>He told local media that he “never wanted to get the dogs”, and that he was concerned they had become “vicious”.</p>
      <p>Authorities believe that the rescue dogs attacked the woman and she was able to put them outside before succumbing to her injuries.</p>
      <p>It was deemed likely that Ms Matthews, who reportedly suffered from alcohol and prescription medicine addiction, did not realise the severity of her injuries.</p>
      <p>Police said there was evidence she had changed her clothes and attempted to clear up the blood.</p>
      <p>Mr Matthews told the the <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/warren-county-woman-mauled-death-home-her-dogs/8nmkFlNwKmgoj7u4aP7IqJ/">Dayton Daily News</a>: “She was laying on the bathroom floor. She had enough strength to get them out the back door but she barely made it back to the bathroom</p>
      <p>“I never wanted Great Danes but she wanted to rescue them. She loved animals so I let her get them. I probably should have put my foot down and said, ‘no,’ </p>
      <p>“Usually when the dogs got aggressive with her I would just discipline them and put them outside but I wasn’t here.”</p>
      <p>Police said the victim, who was discovered on Friday, suffered from chronic alcoholism, which may have impacted her ability to respond to the situation.</p>

      <p>The police report added: “Due to this history, it is felt that [Ms Matthews] may not have been in a clear-minded state to judge the severity of her situation and thus failed to call for help.”</p>
      <p>The dogs have now been put down.</p>
