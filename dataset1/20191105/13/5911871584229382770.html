    <meta property="og:description" content="The Rentals put out their first full-length in 15 years back in 2014, and now it's only taken the Matt Sharp-led band 6 years this time around to put together a new album. The former Weezer bassist has just officially announced their new album, Q36. It won't be out until June 2020, but in a tweet Sharp said that the band will share a new song from it every two weeks until the release date. Sharp recorded the album with the Nick Zinner on guitar, Ronnie Vannucci Jr. on drums, and Dave Fridmann as a mixing engineer. Sharp produced the album himself and wrote all the songs. Today, he's releasing a video for new single &quot;Spaceships&quot; from it, a song that takes mental health to the galaxy. &quot;We are schizophrenic drifters, lost in multiple dimensions/ A supernatural voyage, searching for a place to call home,&quot; Sharp sings on it. Watch the video for it below. Q36 is out 6/2/20. Pre-order it here."/>
