      <h1>Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro goes official w/ first 108-megapixel smartphone camera</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:33:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/damien9to5/" target="_blank">Damien Wilde</a></address>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro has gone official with a landmark 108-megapixel penta-camera setup.</p>
      <p>Beyond the headline camera sensor, the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro has mainly mid-range specifications including a Snapdragon 730G chipset, 6/8GB of RAM, 128/256GB of internal storage, and a massive 5,260mAh battery.</p>
      <p>That battery can be topped up at an impressive speed too, as it comes with a 30W fast charger in the box. This can take you from zero to 58% battery in just 30 minutes and zero to 100% in just 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>The 6.47-inch AMOLED display has an FHD+ resolution in an 19.5:9 aspect ratio. It also includes a dewdrop notch that houses a 32-megapixel selfie camera. Round back, the star of the show is the 108-megapixel main camera sensor that is backed by a 5-megapixel 5x telephoto zoom lens, 12-megapixel 2x telephoto zoom lens, 20-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2-megapixel macro lens.</p>

      <p>As for the 108-megapixel sensor, it comes with the Samsung ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that was developed in partnership with Xiaomi. This is a big sensor by smartphone standards, measuring in at 1/1.33-inches. But it’s unclear just what kind of results this camera system will be able to produce.</p>
      <p>Using pixel-binning tech you’ll get super hi-res 27-megapixel images in most conditions but Xiaomi has stated that you can take 108 million pixel images using the in-built Pro camera mode to produce billboard-sized prints that can measure in at 4.24 meters high.</p>
      <p>The Xiaomi CC9 Pro will go on sale from tomorrow in China for approximately $400 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Global availability was not outright confirmed but hinted at by Xiaomi — <a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1191625461773697024">likely as the Mi Note 10</a> — but we expect this to only be in limited markets.</p>
