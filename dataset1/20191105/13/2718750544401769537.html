      <p>Vanessa Hudgens is back in a musical and it’s not <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/the-high-school-musical-tv-show-is-very-meta.html"><i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i></a><i>. </i>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/alexandra-shipp-andrew-garfield-tick-tick-boom-vanessa-hudgens-robin-de-jesus-netflix-film-1202772707/">Deadline</a>, Hudgens, <i>X-Men </i>actress Alexandra Shipp, and Tony nominee <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/2019-tony-award-nominations-nominees-full-list.html">Robin de Jesús</a> have all been cast in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Netflix adaptation of <i>Tick, Tick … Boom!</i>, a musical by Jonathan Larson set in the 1990s. They join Andrew Garfield, who has already been cast as the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/lin-manuel-miranda-tick-tick-boom-cast-andrew-garfield.html">musical’s autobiographical protagonist</a>, Jon, a struggling theater composer who’s about to hit the big three-oh. He faces pressure from his girlfriend, Susan (Shipp), and his best friend, Michael, has already given up his hopes for a creative, high-paying job. Jonathan Larson eventually wrote the Broadway hit <i>Rent</i>, but died before the musical’s first Off Broadway performance. Hudgens played Maureen in a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/rent-live-changes-updates-lyrics-original-musical.html">live television broadcast of <i>Rent</i></a><i>, </i>de Jesús has multiple Tony nominations, and Shipp played Aaliyah in a biopic. Andrew Garfield better get working on those vocals!</p>
