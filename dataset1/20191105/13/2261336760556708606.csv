“Gamebred” threw the knee at “Funky” as soon as the fight commenced. On Satuday’s “BMF” title fight against Nate Diaz at UFC 244, Masvidal attempted the shot once again, but ended up faking. Seeing it a half a step ahead, Diaz hopped back.
Seeing this moment unfold, Askren had some words to say, basing it on his own experience.



Masvidal ended up with the TKO victory when the doctor called a stop to the fight at the end of round three, after seeing the deep gash above Diaz’s right eye. The two men are willing to run it back, but UFC president Dana White has other plans for Masvidal.
