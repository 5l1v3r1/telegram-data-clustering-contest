The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2019
82 great gift ideas for the holidays
05 Nov 2019, 13:00 by Verge Staff
As the end of 2019 approaches, it’s a good time to think back and reflect on the year that was and to think about the friends, family, and co-workers in our lives who we are grateful and thankful to have. While it can be difficult to find a way to express that sentiment with a gift — which is why they say it’s the thought that counts — you still want to make sure you give them something good and not, like, rock hard fruit cake.
That’s why we convene the greatest minds at The Verge each year to put together our annual holiday gift guide list that’s full of gift suggestions. Whether you need a gift for friends, family, co-workers, pets, they, them, him, her, secret Santa, white elephant, or just something to inspire your own unique gift idea, here are some of our top picks.
