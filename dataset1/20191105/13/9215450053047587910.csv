【派錢4000蚊】關愛共享計劃於今年2月1日起接受申請，至今9個月，政府表示有超過344萬宗申請個案，但不少合資格申請者至今仍未收到最多4,000元的款項，財經事務及庫務局局長劉怡翔表示，計劃收到逾300萬份申請，逾9成已經派出，尚餘約1%未派出，部分因為資料不齊全，例如銀行戶口有錯、身分證號碼不相符。

關愛共享計劃超過344萬宗申請個案
財政司司長陳茂波去年公布2018至19度《財政預算案》「關愛共享計劃」，讓符合相關條件並且在2017至18年度沒有繳交薪俸稅的市民，每人可獲一筆為數4,000元的款項；如果退稅少於四千元的市民則可獲發放差額。
政府發言人早前表示，截至4月30日為止，在職家庭津貼辦事處一共收到約344萬份申請，並已向所有申請人發出申請確認通知。職津處正按申請資格審批所收到的申請，並透過銀行自動轉帳或以現金支票形式向成功申請人發放款額。惟不少合資格申請者至今仍未收到最多4,000元的款項，令市民不滿。

3萬宗個案因申請資料問題
財經事務及庫務局局長劉怡翔早前表示，政府正盡力處理申請，目標在9月底前完成全部申請和發放款項。但目前尚餘約1%未派出，部分因為資料不齊全，例如銀行戶口有錯、身分證號碼不相符。常任秘書長劉焱稱，有3萬宗個案因申請資料問題，未確立是否符合資格，或因為賬戶問題而未能發放金錢。她表示，當局現時可調配人手，用各渠道聯絡申請人，但申請人要盡早回覆才能處理。
遺失約1萬2千份申請表
政府發言人早前亦指，有約1萬2千份申請表雖已輸入初步資料，即已確認收妥，但或因夾雜在其他已處理的申請表中，目前未能尋回，暫未能繼續審批。為加快完成處理這些個案，職津處已發出電話短訊聯絡有關申請人。
仲未收到4000蚊 可以點做？
如申請人仍未收到申請確認通知，欲了解其申請的狀況，可致電職津處熱線3897 1088，或經電郵向職津處查詢。如職津處確定沒有收到個別人士提交的申請，會讓他們補交申請。
