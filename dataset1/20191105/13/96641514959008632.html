      <h1>CVS starts delivering prescriptions to homes via UPS drones</h1>
      <h2>It could help people who can't visit the pharmacy themselves.</h2>

      <p>It didn't take long for UPS and CVS to start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/ups-and-cvs-delivery-drones/">delivering prescriptions by drone</a>. The two have confirmed that they <a href="https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&amp;id=1572918135921-532">completed</a> their first paid home deliveries of prescriptions, hauling medicine to two homes (one of which was a retirement community) in Cary, North Carolina on November 1st. The drones flew autonomously and lowered the packages to the ground with a cable and winch, although there was a human operator ready to take control.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first paid delivery of any kind from UPS. The company has a deal to shuttle medical samples <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/26/ups-drone-airline/">between WakeMed facilities</a> in Raleigh. That's a commercial arrangement over areas that are under a company's control. Now, it's flying in residential areas and delivering to everyday people. Alphabet's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-18-alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-us-virginia.html">Wing is already delivering medicine</a> as part of a pilot program, but that's limited to over-the-counter medication, gifts and snacks.</p>
      <p>It's not exactly a booming business with just two deliveries. However, it's still a significant milestone. The deliveries point to a future where you don't have to travel to the pharmacy, or else wait for a courier truck to make its usual rounds -- you could get the medicine you need within minutes of your supply running out. It also bodes well for mainstream adoption of drone delivery, even if it's likely to be a long while before you can assume your prescription pills will descend from the skies.</p>
