Saudia Dairy and Foodstuff Company (SADAFCO) has introduced a new Saudia milk, fortified with 60 percent more calcium to help consumers live a healthy lifestyle and maintain strong bones. 
Saudia Calcium Milk was officially launched on Oct. 20 to mark World Osteoporosis Day. Around 38 percent of men and 28 percent of women aged above 50 suffer from osteoporosis in Saudi Arabia, and with the percentage of the population in the 50-plus segment expected to rise steeply in coming years, the Ministry of Health encourages people to maintain sufficient levels of calcium in their diet. 
Ensuring a nutritious diet and maintaining an adequate calcium intake is an important defense against osteoporosis, and for maintaining strong bones. Available in one-liter Tetra Pak, the new low-fat milk claims to enable health-conscious consumers to live the lives they want while enjoying the delicious taste of Saudia milk.
