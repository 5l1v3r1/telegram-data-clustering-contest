      <h2>Former 'Harry Potter' star turn 30 in April</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:25:49+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Rory Sullivan, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/08/05/world/emma-watson-sexual-harassment-line-trnd/index.html">Emma Watson </a>has said she prefers to call herself "self-partnered" rather than single as she approaches her 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>Watson, 29, who rose to fame as Hermione Granger in the <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/09/03/us/harry-potter-catholic-church-st-edward-nashville-trnd/index.html">Harry Potter </a>films, coined the phrase in an <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-on-fame-activism-little-women">interview</a> with <a href="https://cnn.com/style/article/duchess-meghan-british-vogue-scli-gbr-intl/index.html">British Vogue</a> in which she discussed the pressures of turning 30.</p>
      <p>The actor and activist, whose birthday is in April, said she initially did not understand the "fuss" that surrounded the milestone.</p>
      <p>More recently, however, she admitted feeling "stressed and anxious" about her upcoming birthday.</p>
      <p>She told British Vogue: "If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you're not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you're still figuring things out... There's just this incredible amount of anxiety."</p>
      <p>Speaking of how she had never believed the "'I'm happy single' spiel," she added: "It took me a long time, but I'm very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered."</p>
      <p>The new phrase is reminiscent of actor<a href="https://cnn.com/2019/03/19/entertainment/gwyneth-paltrow-divorce/index.html"> Gwyneth Paltrow's use of the term "conscious uncoupling"</a> to describe her divorce proceedings from the Coldplay singer Chris Martin in 2014.</p>
      <p>Later this year, Watson will return to the screen playing Margaret "Meg" March in "Little Women" alongside Laura Dern and Meryl Streep -- both of whom she knew previously through their activism.</p>
      <p>The full interview will appear in the December issue of British Vogue and will be available from November 8.</p>
