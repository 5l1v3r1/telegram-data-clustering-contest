FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The man found guilty last month of 2nd Degree Murder in the death of Dr. Teresa Sievers is requesting a new trial.
According to court filings, Jimmy Rodgers is requesting a new trial.
Documents show that Rodgers' attorney believes evidence filed by the state days before the trial would have proved his innocence. The attorney filed a motion before the trial, requesting it be pushed back so they could review the almost 5,000 pages of new documents.
That motion was denied and the trial proceeded.
Our legal analyst says a new trial is likely, but there would be one big challenge. “One of the problems you run into with a request for a new trial is that if that the new evidence is going to change the minds of a juror,” says Dr. Pamela Seay.
Jury selection for the trial of Teresa's husband, Mark Sievers, starts next week.
Investigators say he hired Rodgers and Curtis Wright to kill Teresa for insurance money.
Rodgers was found guilty by a jury on October 23rd for his role in an alleged conspiracy to murder Teresa Sievers, a Bonita Springs doctor, in 2015.
Rodgers is currently awaiting sentencing on November 18th.
