      <h1>Springboks bus parade: Here's where to catch a glimpse of the world champions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:16:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Kamva Somdyala</a></address>
      <p>Rugby World Cup winners the Springboks will begin their five-day trophy parade on Thursday, starting in the capital city, Pretoria, on Thursday and ending off in the Mother City, Cape Town, on Monday.</p>
      <p>And you can catch a glimpse of the country's heroes if you can make it to one of these five cities.</p>
      <p>The Boks, now the world's best team after convincingly beating England 32-12 in the final on Saturday, are expected to arrive on a number of flights from Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Coach Rassie Erasmus, captain Siya Kolisi and vice-captain Handre Pollard will be among those who arrive on Tuesday, with SA Rugby saying that their arrival time had been moved to 19:00 due to technical difficulties in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The Boks not only arrive with the Web Ellis Cup, but with the bragging rights of being <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/rassie-springboks-pieter-steph-all-big-winners-at-world-rugby-awards-20191103">named</a> World Rugby's Team of the Year; Erasmus as Coach of the Year and flank Pieter-Steph du Toit as Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>After the game on Saturday, Kolisi dedicated the win to the many South Africans who had supported the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/springboks-this-ones-for-you-sa-were-not-crying-youre-crying-20191102">squad</a>. Indeed, even throughout the tournament, both coach and captain made it a point to always acknowledge the support back home.</p>
      <p>Now, South Africans will have a chance to see the Boks during the trophy parade:</p>
