Safety fence taken down as the reopening of Plymouth Argyle's grandstand gets ever closer
The redevelopment work has taken place at Home Park over the past 15 months
05 Nov 2019, 13:56 by Chris Errington
Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe has been pushing for it for quite a while but now it is finally happening.
The safety fence by the side of the Home Park pitch, which has been in place while the redevelopment of the Mayflower Grandstand has taken place over the past 15 months, is being removed.
It means the new dug-outs which are inset into the front few rows of the grandstand can now be used and the white ARGYLE lettering in the green seats can be seen fully.
Argyle’s next home game is scheduled to be against Bradford City at Home Park on Saturday, November 23.
The safety fence was erected because the grandstand was effectively a building site during the extensive work on it.
The official handover of the grandstand from main contractors GL Events UK to Argyle, for their final fitting out, is set to take place shortly.
The grandstand will be open for use for the first time when Argyle Ladies play Watford on Sunday, December 8, albeit at only 25 per cent of capacity.
That will be one of a series of test events leading up to the full opening of the grandstand for the Pilgrims' League Two game against Swindon Town on January 1.
