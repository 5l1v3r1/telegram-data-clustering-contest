      <h1>5 things we noticed from Arsenal training as Unai Emery keeps an eye on Granit Xhaka</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal take on Vitoria in the Europa League on Wednesday night and Granit Xhaka could return to action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:46:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka was all smiles in training on Tuesday ahead of the Gunners' Europa League clash with Vitoria.</p>
      <p>The Swiss has missed the Gunners' past two fixtures following a spat with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans, but could make a return for the group game in Portugal.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were meant to play Vitoria on Thursday but the game has been pushed forward a day to accommodate Portuguese authorities and to minimise traffic.</p>
      <p>Braga host Besiktas at the Municipal Stadium on Thursday, and by moving the Arsenal game it is hoped the two matches will pass without incident.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game Arsenal hit their London Colney training ground. Here's what we noticed.</p>
      <h3>1. Keeping his chin up</h3>
      <p>It's been a tough couple of weeks for Xhaka.</p>
      <p>During Arsenal's 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> he was booed off the pitch and reacted badly by cupping his ears, swearing at supporters and storming off down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Emery later revealed that his skipper was "devastated" by the incident, and he reportedly even had team-mates visit him at home to offer him comfort.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Xhaka kept his cards close to his chest in the following days, despite his manager suggesting he should apologise to the fans for his outburst.</p>
      <p>But he later released a statement explaining what lead to the situation, and called for unity.</p>
      <p>It seems - judging by Tuesday's training pictures - that Xhaka is doing his best to keep his chin up and move on from the unfortunate situation.</p>
      <h3>2. Under Emery's watchful eye</h3>
      <p>Emery appeared to keep a close eye on Xhaka during Tuesday's training session.</p>
      <p>The midfielder looked to be back to his best, but the boss was certainly monitoring him, especially as he left him out against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> because he wasn't 'in the right frame of mind'.</p>
      <p>Emery has a big decision to make now regarding his captain, and that's whether he allows him to keep the armband or not.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The captaincy is a bigger deal in the UK than it is on the continent - which is why Emery let his players vote for who they thought deserved it - and the current situation is one that needs to be worked out soon.</p>
      <p>Does Emery let Xhaka keep the armband and risk further isolating a section of fans already on his back, or does he take it off him and risk losing the dressing room?</p>
      <h3>3. Ready to make a comeback</h3>
      <p>As aforesaid, Emery left Xhaka out against Wolves because his focus was elsewhere.</p>
      <p>But it seems the dust has settled enough now for the Arsenal boss to consider returning him to the first team set-up.</p>
      <p>And this Wednesday's Europa League clash appears to be the perfect time to re-introduce Xhaka to the Arsenal fans.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Arsenal are on the road, and out of the country in a less-pressured game than away at high-flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City this weekend.</p>
      <p>The match will pass under the radar - or at least more so than Saturday's fixture - and will therefore provide the perfect opportunity for Emery to break the ice by bringing Xhaka back.</p>
      <h3>4. Back in first-team contention</h3>
      <p>Another man back in the first team, and seemingly delighted about it, is Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>Before the Gunners' Carabao Cup clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> the German World Cup winner had featured just twice in all competitions this season - despite not suffering an injury.</p>
      <p>Worst of all was that fact that in these two fixtures he was hooked around the hour mark.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ozil didn't get the chance to play the full game against Liverpool, but he was hands down Arsenal's best player on the night.</p>
      <p>And his performance earned him a place in Arsenal's starting XI against Wolves. Whether he'll feature for a third consecutive match in Portugal this week is anyone's guess.</p>
      <h3>5. Communication is key</h3>
      <p>Emery is under pressure at Arsenal, there's no two words about it.</p>
      <p>But he has been calling on his backroom staff to give him a helping hand, especially where communication is concerned.</p>
      <p>Robin van Persie is among the pundits who have suggested Emery's poor English is making it difficult for players to understand his instructions.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There have also been reports that some of the younger players are gravitating towards assistant head coach Freddie Ljungberg for guidance.</p>
      <p>It's not great news for Emery, but if he is struggling to get his point across then having his assistants assist him may just save him his job.</p>
