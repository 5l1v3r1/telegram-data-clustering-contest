一趟印度之行 讓她找到生命回歸之路

05 Nov 2019, 13:22

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】今年48歲的斯維特蘭娜（Svetlana）生活在莫斯科，她有了一份新的工作，幼教。也許她從沒想到她會做這樣一份工作，或許是命運裡的一次必然，讓她從生命的複雜走向純真。
她是一個執著於精神追求的人，為尋法求道走得曲曲折折。她曾進過修道院，研讀過心理學，後來又去了印度，她所做的一切都只為一個目的，尋找生命的答案。她不斷學習、尋找，做過企業培訓師，做過瑜伽師，甚至她的身後還有一些追隨者。可她內心深處依舊感覺沒有歸處，焦躁、迷茫如影隨形。
直到2009年，她終於找到了讓生命回歸的大法，才恍然大悟，她驚歎：「這就是我要找的！我為尋找心靈昇華的修行方法，整整尋覓了17年！」
生命因大法而改變，從此她脫胎換骨了。她徹底走出了陰霾，面向太陽，一下活得快樂、輕鬆了，她說：「現在，大法是我內心最大的精神支柱！」
她的尋法之路到底經歷了什麼？

逆境中尋法

斯維特蘭娜出生在俄羅斯，母親是工程師，父親做建築工作，在這個典型的知識分子家庭裡，她是個傳統女孩，熱愛生活，熱愛家庭，19歲就成家了。可她的第一次婚姻卻很不幸。丈夫是退役軍人，因為赴阿富汗參加過戰爭，落下了戰後軍人後遺症，性情暴烈，經常爆發脾氣，緊張的家庭氣氛讓斯維特蘭娜如履薄冰。
儘管她努力地去幫助丈夫工作，緩解他的壓力，做他的會計師、做他的祕書，最終還幫助他成為了一家小企業的經理，但依舊沒有得到好的結果。年輕的她無時無刻不在掙扎中，無論她怎麼付出，丈夫依舊像家庭的暴君。在痛苦和失落中，她不得不開始思考命運，尋找精神寄託。
「那時我感覺婚姻不成功，就開始考慮去修道院了。我有意識地接受了基督教，開始認真研究《聖經》。」斯維特蘭娜提到了她婚姻挫敗後採取的自救方法。她走入了宗教圈，期望得到神的救贖，解脫精神痛苦，衝出魔障。
斯維特蘭娜每個週末都去教堂懺悔，並試圖按照自己所理解的遵守基督教戒律。她的學習是認真的，遺憾的是她的心境沒有在宗教的教化中得到改善。
「那時我非常膽小和焦慮。在教堂裡，有時我也能感到某種善良和仁慈的狀態，但我看到宗教儀式的背後沒有任何實質的東西。」
她學習宗教，但心沒有進入。她不斷在思考，試圖找到產生她痛苦的原因，這是根本問題。她沒有得到答案，於是決定研讀心理學。她的丈夫堅決反對她求學。為了求學，斯維特蘭娜離開了他，這段婚姻終結了。
斯維特蘭娜進入了俄羅斯教育學院，白天工作，晚上自費上學。
90年代初期的莫斯科與歐美同步，東方哲學思想的引進激發了人們對靈性的探索，打坐、瑜伽、太極拳、氣功等等東方元素讓西方人著迷。人們對信仰的認識已不再局限在某一種傳統的宗教形式之內。這種開放的思想，也被稱作「新時代思想」。這期間，她大量閱讀了哲學書籍。
「我開始了解瑜伽，還讀了很多書，又開始研讀《摩訶婆羅多》……」
在閱讀中，斯維特蘭娜迷上了東方文化。《摩訶婆羅多》是印度著名史詩，對於印度的哲學和宗教影響極大。從這裡，她開始了東方哲學思想的研究與實踐，放下了原來的宗教探索。
「我去了很多修道院後，決定不再去了。我看到許多宗教都敗壞了。在我的夢中，我看到教會中的牧師們如何計算儀式和出售教堂用具的收入。我還看到了地球充滿了有毒的氣體，為避免弄髒和中毒，人幾乎沒有地方可以下腳。我看到在人群中還行走著非人類……」
斯維特蘭娜能感受到普通人感受不到的事情。她很敏感，很有靈性。這讓她越發想找到提升的方法，讓精神昇華。她開始進入了心理學訓練。
這個心理學訓練是私人授課。在這裡，她切身感受到了東方信仰的真實感。她也恰好在這個時節趕上了一股「新潮」……她一心想找到精神提升的方法。但七年的實踐，結果並不樂觀。她發現這條路根本走不通。
斯維特蘭娜身上有種韌性，彷彿生來就要吃這份苦似的，為了精神追求，她可以放棄所有的生活享受。
那時她已有了一個相對穩定的工作，職業培訓師，培訓企業員工和管理人員，工作不錯，收入也不少。但對靈性的追求一直占據著她心。
「我經常在想，我還沒有找到最高的修煉法門和最高的師父，但我內心充滿了希望，我知道我一定能找到。」
2007年，她去了印度。

印度之行

「我繼續尋找老師和法，又開始學習昆達利尼瑜伽，參加昆達利尼瑜伽有名教師的講習班。最後我自己成了昆達利尼瑜伽的老師。」
在印度學習瑜伽，同時她也在研究宗教。她執著在宗教研究當中，也參與組織名家大師和瑜伽教師的各種講習班。可再深入下去，她又失望了。
「我看到他們對名利和金錢的關注，這讓我感到虛假。在我看來，精神的追求是不能看重金錢的。在那裡，我感到迷茫、失落和沮喪。」
印度，佛教誕生地，吸引著世界各方的尋道者。斯維特蘭娜在那裡沒有找到她想要的，她想尋找一個寧靜的地方待下，她意識到自己可能在逃避什麼。結果，就在她感覺落魄的時候，她又被搶劫了，錢、護照和返回的機票被搶劫一空。這是一個什麼暗示呢？那天，她空空一身回到新德里，偶然去了附近的中央公園，她看到了一個軍樂團，來自台灣，她被他們的音樂所吸引。她又看到樂團的人在煉一種功法，帶著一種平靜、慈悲的場。她看到了他們的橫幅，上面寫著「天國樂團」。這個場景一直留在她腦中。

得大法

斯維特蘭娜尋道求法之心是堅定的。她前後兩年去印度學習，她成了瑜伽老師。她在埃及、土耳其舉辦了實地研討會，並在瑜伽聯合會上進行授課。
參加昆達利尼瑜伽學習班是收費的，這在圈內是必須的規矩。但作為瑜伽老師，她很明白自己的狀況，她自己都還沒有找到答案，又怎麼能引領這些學生？她常常感覺自己在欺騙學生。
「我那時內心一團混亂，一個功法干擾另一個功法，我的個人生活也很不順利。」
那一年她過得很糟糕，總是哭，內心充滿痛苦和悲傷。想了很多很多，卻無處訴說，只能向天空祈禱、訴求。為什麼自己就遇不到一位真正的老師呢？後來她遇到一位帶有功能的修道士，她能夠感覺到他身上的正直，帶著乾淨的場。斯維特蘭娜的第六感官總是很靈。
「我看到從他身上散發出藍色的輝光。我一下感興趣了。他邀請我去談話。」
他是僧人，人們稱他們吠陀僧侶（Vedic monk）。他所在的這所修道院距離下諾夫哥羅德不遠。斯維特蘭娜去了他那裡。他給她介紹自己的寺院和上師，但斯維特蘭娜對那些都不感興趣。
「你知不知道地球上真正的上師？」斯維特蘭娜直截了當地問他。
他很謹慎，看看她，點點頭，悄聲說道：「我知道一位，沒人比他高，他是一位真正的老師，他的水平是不為我所知的，是無邊的上師。」
「他是誰？」
「李洪志！」
李洪志？這個名字斯維特蘭娜從來沒有聽說過，對她來講這個名字太新、太陌生，她在一小塊兒紙上寫下了這個名字。
「還有一本書《轉法輪》。」
斯維特蘭娜萬萬沒有想到，這位修道士正在祕密修煉法輪大法，他的上師都不知道他的祕密。
他還告訴斯維特蘭娜，在修道院裡，僧侶們混合許多印度功法修煉，閱讀不同的書籍。他雖然學了很多印度修煉方法和道家的方法，但現在那些東西都不好用了，哪一個宗教也不救人，只有一條路，就是法輪大法！他的話語言很深刻，印入她心。
回到家後，斯維特蘭娜照著紙條上的記錄上網查找，她找到了《轉法輪》。這本書已經被翻譯成約40種語言文字，並且免費供讀者閱讀。所有一切都是公開的，不收費的，網上還有公開的教功錄像！
斯維特蘭娜閱讀了《轉法輪》，一下就被內容吸引住了。書中解答了她所有要問又不得其解的問題，讓她感覺如醍醐灌頂一般。
「這就是我要找的！我為尋找心靈昇華的修行方法，尋覓了17年！」


17年，斯維特蘭娜（Svetlana）尋尋覓覓，終於找到生命回歸之路。（明慧網）

她感嘆！一路曲曲折折，人生最好的17年她都在苦苦地尋法覓道，肉體的魔練，精神的掙扎，如今終於找到了大法！她明白了痛苦的原因，明白了如何修煉！
對照法輪大法的教導，她找到了自己的問題。
「我發現了我許多的執著和不對的觀念。我意識到我很自私，傾向於競爭、易怒、不寬容、敏感，有強烈的色慾。有一次，我寫下了在自己身上找到的執著，這個數字達到了大約80個、90個，有這麼多需要修去的執著！」
她明白了修煉就在生活的點點滴滴中，只有遵循「真、善、忍」的原則才可以修煉到高層次，甚至有超能力的表現。她也明白了「不二法門」的道理，從前她所修煉的東西都要放下了，這並不容易，但她還是下了決心，關閉了她的瑜伽班。
「要進入大法，我需要真正拋棄一切，最重要的是對名譽、利益和感情的執著。我認為這是我生命中最重要的一步和決定。從那刻起，我真正感受到了自己精神上的提升，我的身心非常的輕鬆了。」
她帶著一顆純淨的心堅定地走入了大法修煉，這也讓她充分地感受到了大法的超常。
「一開始修煉時，我就清楚地感覺到法輪在我肚子裡的旋轉，法輪也在其它地方旋轉。我看到老師從我肚子裡取出黑色的東西。有一次，我聽到後背的椎骨如何歸位，金色的能量從我的脊椎衝了下來。」
消業，清理身體，在大法修煉中就是淨化身體。在她的身體上也真實表現了。修煉一開始，她就出現嚴重的頭痛和嘔吐。她明確，師父管她了！開始給她淨化身體了。她的腦子，裝了太多門派的東西。
「那一整夜我都在嘔吐，無法站穩腳跟，我感到非常頭暈。我試圖起床時，房間模糊不清了，旋轉了起來，讓我噁心、嘔吐。之後，我就陷入了睡眠。我還是繼續聽師父的講法。一天後我的狀態逐漸好轉，我可以喝一點、吃一點東西。又過了一天，我感覺如此地輕盈、清明，我覺得師父清理了我的內臟。之後，我感覺到渾身力量充沛，還有不平凡的輕快感。」
一切都是真實的。身體改善了，精神豁達了，她真的變了，周圍的親戚朋友都看出了她的變化。大家都說她變得更親切、更平靜、更有耐心，更關懷他人了。因為她的修煉，親友也都開始關注法輪功、親近法輪功，大家紛紛在請願書上簽字，譴責中共對法輪功的迫害。
她的修煉得到完全正面的反應，所有的人都支持她。
「以前的我，經常是不能忍耐，情緒不穩，自私自利，懶惰，帶來了家庭矛盾衝突。現在，我主動找自己的不足，並改正。」
2010年，也就是她得法9個月後，她前往美國參加紐約國際法輪大法修煉心得交流會。那是她第一次參加這樣大型的法會，6000多名來自世界各地的法輪功學員相聚一堂，那次讓她終身難忘。
「我記得那次法會，我在聽學員交流的過程中，突然感到一種極大的慈悲，眼淚一下從我眼中湧出了，我的心也在擴張。5分鐘之後，師父出現了，全場人都站起來……多年來，我終於遇到了偉大的師父和偉大的法。師父在台上為我們講法，我的眼淚一直就沒有停止過……」
「我有幸多次見到師父。點點滴滴我都記得，那是我心中最珍貴的回憶。我感受到了師父無限的慈悲。每一次的見面我都可以寫出一個故事，現在都珍藏在我心底。我想說的就是：師父，謝謝您把我從地獄中救出來；謝謝您讓我得到了真法，成了您的弟子。我會精進修煉並履行我的誓言。」
斯維特蘭娜的心越來越純淨了，她的工作每天都在擁抱純真，她也在努力地展現自己的忍耐，善良和愛心。幼教工作中，孩子們很愛她，她的溫和善良也博得家長們的信賴。她自己的家庭更加和睦了，親戚朋友也因為她而對法輪大法有了很好的認識。
斯維特蘭娜總感到自己是幸運的，真正地在大法中回升了。

A trip to India, let her find the way back to life

05 Nov 2019, 13:22

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Svetlana, 48, lives in Moscow and has a new job, early childhood education. Maybe she never thought she would do such a job, perhaps a necessity in her destiny, and let her move from the complexity of life to the innocence.
She is a person who is obsessed with the pursuit of the spirit, and seeks to find a way to find the twists and turns. She had been to the monastery, studied psychology, and later went to India. Everything she did was for a purpose, looking for answers to life. She has been learning, looking for, being a corporate trainer, being a yogi, and even having some followers behind her. However, she still feels that there is no return in her heart, and her anxiety and confusion are as follows.
Until 2009, she finally found the Dafa that brought her back to life, and she suddenly realized that she was ""I am looking for it! I have been looking for a spiritual cultivation method for 17 years!""
Life changed because of Dafa, and she has since reborn. She walked out of the haze completely, facing the sun, and lived happily and relaxed. She said, ""Now, Dafa is the biggest spiritual pillar in my heart!""
What happened to her way of finding the law?

Seeking law in adversity

Svetlana was born in Russia, her mother is an engineer, her father is doing construction work. In this typical intellectual family, she is a traditional girl who loves life and loves her family. She became a family when she was 19 years old. But her first marriage was unfortunate. The husband is a veteran. Because he went to Afghanistan to participate in the war, he fell into the aftermath of the soldiers after the war. His temperament was fierce and his temper often broke out. The tense family atmosphere made Svetlana squat.
Although she worked hard to help her husband work, ease his pressure, be his accountant, be his secretary, and ultimately help him become a manager of a small business, but still did not get good results. Young, she is struggling all the time, no matter how she pays, her husband is still like a family tyrant. In pain and loss, she had to start thinking about her destiny and looking for spiritual sustenance.
""At that time, I felt that the marriage was unsuccessful, and I began to consider going to the monastery. I consciously accepted Christianity and began to study the Bible carefully."" Svetlana mentioned the self-help method adopted after her marriage was defeated. She entered the religious circle and hoped to receive God's redemption, relieve her mental pain, and rush out of the magic barrier.
Svetlana went to church every weekend to repent and tried to follow the Christian commandments as I understood. Her study is serious, but unfortunately her mood has not improved in the education of religion.
""I was very timid and anxious at the time. In the church, sometimes I could feel some kindness and kindness, but I saw that there was no real thing behind the religious ceremony.""
She studied religion, but her heart did not enter. She is constantly thinking, trying to find the cause of her suffering, which is the fundamental problem. She did not get an answer, so she decided to study psychology. Her husband resolutely opposed her study. In order to study, Svetlana left him and the marriage ended.
Svetlana entered the Russian Academy of Education, working during the day and attending school at her own expense at night.
In the early 1990s, Moscow was synchronized with Europe and the United States. The introduction of oriental philosophical thoughts inspired people to explore spirituality. Oriental elements such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong and so on have fascinated Westerners. People's understanding of faith is no longer confined to a certain traditional form of religion. This open mind is also called ""the new era of thought."" During this time, she read a lot of philosophy books.
""I started to understand yoga, read a lot of books, and started to study ""Maha Bharata""...""
In reading, Svetlana fell in love with Eastern culture. Mahabharata is a famous Indian epic that has a great influence on Indian philosophy and religion. From here, she began the research and practice of oriental philosophical thoughts and laid down the original religious exploration.
""After I went to many monasteries, I decided not to go any more. I saw that many religions were corrupted. In my dreams, I saw how the pastors in the church calculated the rituals and the income from the sale of church utensils. I also saw The earth is full of toxic gases. To avoid soiling and poisoning, there is almost no place for people to go. I see that there are non-humans walking in the crowd...""
Svetlana can feel things that ordinary people can't feel. She is very sensitive and very spiritual. This made her more and more want to find ways to improve and let the spirit sublimate. She began to enter psychological training.
This psychology training is privately taught. Here, she personally felt the true feeling of the Eastern faith. She also happened to catch up with a ""new wave"" at this time... She was bent on finding a way to improve her spirit. But after seven years of practice, the results are not optimistic. She found that this road simply could not get through.
Svetlana has a kind of resilience, as if she was born to eat this bitter, for spiritual pursuit, she can give up all the enjoyment of life.
At that time, she had a relatively stable job, a professional trainer, training of corporate employees and managers, and she had a good job and a lot of income. But the pursuit of spirituality has always occupied her heart.
""I often think that I have not found the highest practice method and the highest master, but I am full of hope inside, I know I will find it.""
In 2007, she went to India.

Trip to India

""I continued to look for teachers and law, and started to study Kundalini Yoga, a workshop for famous teachers of Kundalini Yoga. Finally I became a teacher of Kundalini Yoga.""
Studying yoga in India, she is also studying religion. She is obsessed with religious studies and is involved in various workshops for organizing masters and yoga teachers. Can go further, she was disappointed again.
""I saw their concern about fame and fortune, which made me feel false. In my opinion, spiritual pursuit can't value money. I feel confused, lost and depressed.""
India, the birthplace of Buddhism, attracts seekers from all walks of life around the world. Svetlana didn't find what she wanted there, she wanted to find a quiet place to stay, she realized she might be escaping. As a result, she was robbed when she felt lonely, and money, passports and returned tickets were looted. What is this suggestion? That day, she returned to New Delhi empty-air and accidentally went to the nearby Central Park. She saw a military band from Taiwan, she was attracted by their music. She also saw that the orchestra's people were practicing a practice, with a calm, compassionate field. She saw their banner with the words ""The Heavenly Orchestra."" This scene has remained in her mind.

Dafa

Svetlana’s search for the heart of the law is firm. She went to India to study in the past two years, and she became a yoga teacher. She has held field seminars in Egypt and Turkey and taught at the Yoga Federation.
Participating in the Kundalini Yoga class is a fee, which is a must in the circle. But as a yoga teacher, she understands her own situation. She has not found the answer herself. How can she lead these students? She often feels she is cheating on students.
""I was in a mess at the time, one exercise interfered with another, and my personal life was not going well.""
That year she had a bad time, always crying, and her heart filled with pain and sorrow. I thought a lot, but there is nowhere to tell, I can only pray and appeal to the sky. Why can't I meet a real teacher myself? Later she met a functional monk who could feel the integrity of his body with a clean field. Svetlana’s sixth sense is always very spiritual.
""I saw a blue glow from him. I was interested. He invited me to talk.""
He is a monk, people call them Vedic monk. The monastery where he is located is not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Svetlana went to him. He introduced her to the monastery and the guru, but Svetlana was not interested in those.
""Do you know the true Guru on Earth?"" Svetlana asked him straight away.
He was very cautious, look at her, nodded and whispered: ""I know one, no one is taller than him. He is a real teacher. His level is not known to me. It is boundless. division.""
""Who is he?""
""Li Hongzhi!""
Li Hongzhi? The name Svetlana had never heard of it. For her, the name was too new and too strange. She wrote the name on a small piece of paper.
""There is also a book, Zhuan Falun.""
Svetlana never imagined that the monk was secretly practicing Falun Dafa. His master did not know his secrets.
He also told Svetlana that in the monastery, the monks mixed many Indian practices and read different books. Although he has learned a lot of Indian cultivation methods and Taoist methods, but now those things are not easy to use, which religion does not save people, there is only one way, that is, Falun Dafa! His words are very deep and printed into her heart.
After returning home, Svetlana looked online on the note on the note and she found Zhuan Falun. The book has been translated into about 40 languages and is free for readers to read. Everything is open, no charge, there are public videos on the Internet!
Svetlana read ""Zhuan Falun"" and was attracted to the content. The book answers all the questions she has to ask and can't solve, making her feel like a slap in the face.
""This is what I am looking for! I have been searching for a spiritual rejuvenation method for 17 years!""


In 17 years, Svetlana searched for cockroaches and finally found the way back to life. (明慧网)

She lamented! All the way to the twists and turns, the best 17 years in life, she is struggling to find the way to marry, the physical magic, the struggle of the spirit, and now finally found Dafa! She understood the cause of the pain and understood how to cultivate!
In contrast to the teachings of Falun Dafa, she found her own problem.
""I found out a lot of my attachments and misconceptions. I realized that I am selfish, tend to be competitive, irritable, intolerant, sensitive, and have a strong desire. Once I wrote down the persistence I found in myself. This number has reached about 80, 90, and there are so many attachments that need to be repaired!""
She understands that cultivation is in the bits and pieces of life. Only by following the principle of ""truthfulness, benevolence, and forbearance"" can we cultivate to a high level and even have superpowers. She also understood the truth of the ""two ways"". She had to let go of what she had cultivated before. It was not easy, but she made up her mind and closed her yoga class.
""To enter Dafa, I need to really abandon everything. The most important thing is the attachment to reputation, interests and feelings. I think this is the most important step and decision in my life. From that moment on, I really felt my spirit. The improvement of my body and mind is very relaxed.""
She walked firmly into Dafa cultivation with a pure heart, which also made her fully feel the extraordinary of Dafa.
""At the beginning of the cultivation, I clearly felt the rotation of the Falun in my stomach. The Falun also rotated in other places. I saw the teacher taking out the black things from my stomach. Once, I heard how the vertebrae of the back were returned. Bit, golden energy rushed down my spine.""
Eliminate the industry, clean up the body, and purify the body in Dafa cultivation. It also shows up on her body. At the beginning of her cultivation, she developed severe headache and vomiting. She is clear, Master is in charge of her! Start to purify her body. Her mind is loaded with too many martial arts things.
""I was vomiting all night, I couldn't stand firm, I felt very dizzy. When I tried to get out of bed, the room was blurred, and it turned, making me sick and vomiting. After that, I fell asleep. I I continued to listen to Master’s teachings. After a day, my condition gradually improved, I could drink a little and eat something. After another day, I felt so light and clear, I think Master cleaned up my internal organs. After that, I felt It’s full of strength and an extraordinary sense of urgency.""
Everything is real. The body has improved, the spirit is open-minded, she has really changed, and the relatives and friends around her have seen her changes. Everyone said that she became more cordial, calmer, more patient, and caring for others. Because of her cultivation, her relatives and friends have also begun to pay attention to Falun Gong and get close to Falun Gong. Everyone has signed the petition and condemned the CCP’s persecution of Falun Gong.
Her cultivation was completely positive, and everyone supported her.
""In the past, I was often intolerant, emotionally unstable, selfish and lazy, and brought conflicts in family. Now, I take the initiative to find my own deficiencies and correct them.""
In 2010, nine months after she got the law, she went to the United States to participate in the New York International Falun Dafa Cultivation Experience Exchange. That was the first time she had participated in such a large-scale guild. More than 6,000 Falun Gong practitioners from all over the world gathered together, which made her unforgettable.
""I remember that faculty meeting. During the process of listening to the students, I suddenly felt a great compassion. Tears poured out from my eyes, and my heart was expanding. After 5 minutes, Master appeared, the audience I have stood up... Over the years, I finally met the great Master and the great law. Master taught us the law on the stage, and my tears have never stopped...""
""I have had the privilege of seeing Master many times. I remember all the bits and pieces. That is the most precious memory in my heart. I feel the infinite compassion of Master. Every time I meet, I can write a story that is now treasured in me. The bottom of my heart. What I want to say is: Master, thank you for saving me from hell; thank you for letting me get the truth and become your disciple. I will practice and practice my vows.""
Svetlana's heart is getting more and more pure. Her work is embracing innocence every day. She is also trying to show her patience, kindness and love. In the early childhood education work, the children love her very much, and her gentleness and kindness also won the trust of parents. Her own family is more harmonious, and relatives and friends have a good understanding of Falun Dafa because of her.
Svetlana always felt that she was lucky and really recovered in Dafa.
