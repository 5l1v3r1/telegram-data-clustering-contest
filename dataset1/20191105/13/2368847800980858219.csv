05 Nov 2019, 13:33

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】睽違3年，歌手楊乃文本月將發行第7張專輯《越美麗越看不見》，昨天（4日）受電台邀約研習花藝，透露自己最近有些爛桃花，但她不是一個接一個的談感情，若沒有戀情就不強求。

談及主打歌《悔過書》，講話直爽的楊乃文表示，每個人都被批評過，自己當然也被批評過，坦言以自己的個性，不用做什麼事，就容易讓人產生誤解。
但她認為，批評的人只是用自己的標準來評判，「在社會上，多眾總是贏過小眾的，小眾的標準也是可行的啊，你不一定要多胖多高多漂亮。但大眾的眼光會去指責比較算是格格不入的人。而被講了很多次的人，到最後真的覺得自己不對了，或者就是好啊是我錯，不想再講下去。」
楊乃文舉例，現在網路上充斥著社群軟體，有人寫了她不好的評價，還想盡辦法一定要她看到。她坦言自己會受傷，但也不可能反擊，「因為反擊就是他們想要的。」就讓時間慢慢去療傷。
楊乃文提到自己也有被霸凌過的經驗，年輕去雪梨的時候，因為不會說英文常常被欺負，但她也以正面思考，去努力學好英文，之後就很少有這樣的情況發生了。

專輯同名曲《越美麗越看不見》與主打歌《悔過書》，都由中國大陸知名創作人郭頂寫曲，楊乃文表示，填詞人葛大為一開始要郭頂創作超芭樂的歌，不過到最後，「他的兩首歌，是全專輯最不芭樂的。」她也表示跟郭頂默契很好。

You don't have to be fatter, taller and more beautiful. But The public’s vision will be accused of being a person who is out of place. Those who have been told many times, in the end, really feel that they are not right, or that is good, I am wrong, I don’t want to talk anymore.""
For example, Yang Naiwen is now full of social software on the Internet. Some people have written her bad comments, and she still tries her best to see them. She admits that she will be injured, but it is impossible to fight back. ""Because the counterattack is what they want."" Let time slowly heal.
Yang Naiwen mentioned that he also had experience of being bullied. When he was younger to Sydney, he was often bullied because he could not speak English. However, she also thought positively and tried to learn English well. After that, few such cases occurred.
