葉蘊儀在烏克蘭獨立廣場發聲：心與香港相聯

05 Nov 2019, 13:20

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】一直為「反送中」、「反極權」運動發聲的香港藝人葉蘊儀，11月4日在社交網站貼文晒照，並寫道：「站在烏克蘭的獨立廣場，心與香港相聯。」寓意深遠的照片和留言感動眾人，網民紛紛誇讚：「人靚心靚！」「多謝你在這個狀況下依然持著你的良心去發聲去支持！因為我們都是在香港出生的香港人！」
自今年6月份香港「反送中」運動爆發以來，葉蘊儀多次勇敢發聲。
在6月9日103萬市民上街遊行表達「反送中」的訴求之後，6月12日又有上萬人在金鐘一帶阻擋立法會二讀，結果遭到警方釋放催淚彈、胡椒噴霧、布袋彈、橡膠子彈鎮壓。
看到包括大批年輕人被暴力鎮壓的畫面，葉蘊儀當晚在facebook以黑屏幕留言「心痛」，13日又轉貼一位母親在立法會門前示威時痛哭著向警方呼籲不要打小孩的新聞片段。
葉蘊儀感慨：「我都看到流淚，因為我也是一位母親。我相信有些警察都有自己的孩子，也跟市民一樣為人父母，大家其實都心愛香港，但現在搞到警民關係成這個樣子。」
她還轉貼了英、美、法等國際媒體報導港人湧上街頭反惡法的震撼人心的新聞，並寫下：「全世界都在看（The whole world is watching）。」
自香港市民發起「8.5三罷」後，港警對「反送中」抗爭者的暴力鎮壓不斷升級，攻擊無辜市民成為常態。自8月4日一女性抗爭者在天水圍被警方強行逮捕，期間她被扯下內褲導致走光後，港警10日在尖沙咀撲倒一名過路少女，過程中亦施用性暴力，令現場目睹的民眾怒不可遏，葉蘊儀在facebook發文：「強烈譴責警察以性暴力鎭壓示威者！」



11月4日，葉蘊儀在Instagram(IG)和facebook貼出在烏克蘭獨立廣場唱歌的照片，並寫下：「心與香港相聯！」並標籤「#welovehongkong」、「#standwithhongkong」等詞，網民紛紛留言感激。
出差到烏克蘭的葉蘊儀，此次選擇在烏克蘭獨立廣場發聲，別具深意。
烏克蘭獨立廣場是當地在2004年橙色革命及2014年烏克蘭革命的地標。特別是2013年11月21日，烏克蘭爆發了百萬市民對抗腐敗政權的大規模抗議。
面對政府的血腥鎮壓，烏克蘭人民憑藉「和理非」構築的大團結，在獨立廣場的冰天雪地裡持續留守93天，終於在2014年2月23日取得了最後的勝利：總統亞努科維奇逃到俄羅斯尋求庇護，政府答應不再向平民使用暴力，釋放所有被捕者，並與歐盟簽署協議。這場運動還拍攝成提名奧斯卡最佳紀錄片的《凜冬烈火：烏克蘭自由之戰》（Winter On Fire）。
葉蘊儀1973年出生於香港，13歲開始拍攝廣告，隨後踏入演藝圈。集演員、歌手和藝術家於一身的她，曾獲「澳大利亞墨爾本皇家理工大學」純藝術學士和碩士學位，是香港影視圈20世紀八十年代末崛起的玉女明星。

Ye Yunyi speaks in the Ukrainian Independence Square: the heart is connected with Hong Kong

05 Nov 2019, 13:20

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Hong Kong artist Ye Yunyi, who has been vocalizing the ""reverse delivery"" and ""anti-polar rights"" movements, posted photos on social networking sites on November 4 and wrote: ""Standing Ukraine's Independence Square, the heart is connected with Hong Kong."" The far-reaching photos and messages touched everyone. Netizens praised: ""People are worried!"" ""Thank you for your conscience in this situation to support you!"" Because we are all Hong Kong people born in Hong Kong!""
Since the outbreak of the ""Reverse Sending"" campaign in Hong Kong in June this year, Ye Yunyi has repeatedly bravely voiced.
On June 9, after 1.03 million people took to the streets to express their ""reverse delivery"" appeal, on June 12, tens of thousands of people in the Golden Bell area blocked the second reading of the Legislative Council. As a result, the police released tear gas and pepper spray. Bag bombs and rubber bullets are suppressed.
Seeing a picture of a large number of young people being violently suppressed, Ye Yunyi posted a message on the black screen ""Heartache"" on Facebook. On the 13th, she posted a news clip of a mother crying to the police to call for no children.
Ye Yunyi said with emotion: ""I have seen tears because I am also a mother. I believe that some policemen have their own children and are as parents as the citizens. Everyone actually loves Hong Kong, but now they have gotten the relationship between the police and the people. Look like.""
She also reposted the shocking news of British, American, French and other international media reports that Hong Kong people flocked to the streets to fight against evil laws and wrote: ""The whole world is watching.""
Since the Hong Kong people launched the ""8.5 Third Stop"", the violent suppression of the ""reverse delivery"" protesters by the Hong Kong Police has escalated and it has become the norm for attacking innocent citizens. Since August 4, a female protester was forcibly arrested by the police in Tianshuiwei. After she was pulled off her underwear and led to the loss of light, the Hong Kong police officers threw a passing girl in Tsim Sha Tsui on the 10th. During the process, sexual violence was also used to show the people on the scene. Irritated, Ye Yunyi posted on Facebook: ""Strongly condemn the police for suppressing demonstrators with sexual violence!""



On November 4th, Ye Yunyi posted photos of singing in the Independence Square in Ukraine on Instagram (IG) and Facebook, and wrote: ""Heart is connected with Hong Kong!"" and labeled ""#welovehongkong"", ""#standwithhongkong"" and other words, netizens I am grateful for the message.

The Ukrainian Independence Square is the landmark of the local Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014. In particular, on November 21, 2013, a large-scale protest against the corruption regime of millions of citizens broke out in Ukraine.
In the face of the bloody suppression of the government, the Ukrainian people continued to stay in the snow and ice of Independence Square for 93 days with the unity of ""harmony and rationality"", and finally won the final victory on February 23, 2014: President Yanukovy Unexpectedly fleeing to Russia to seek asylum, the government promised not to use violence against civilians, release all arrested persons, and sign an agreement with the European Union. The campaign was also filmed as the best documentary in the Oscar for the ""Winter On Fire"".
Ye Yunyi was born in Hong Kong in 1973. At the age of 13, he began to shoot advertisements and then entered the entertainment circle. She is an actor, singer and artist. She has a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Fine Arts from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia.
