05 Nov 2019, 13:59 by Peter Helman
Yorkston/Thorne/Khan is the trio of Scottish folk guitarist James Yorkston, English jazz double-bassist Jon Thorne, and Indian sarangi player Suhail Yusuf Khan. Early next year, they’re going to release their third collaborative album Navarasa : Nine Emotions, on which each of the nine songs goes with one of the nine emotions (nava) or sentiments (rasa) of the arts.
Today, along with the album announcement, Yorkston/Thorne/Khan are sharing early track “Westlin’ Winds,” which represents abdutha (surprise/wonder). The song begins with Act I of Scottish poet Robert Burns’ “Now Westlin Winds, (And Slaught’ring Guns)” and transposes its Act II onto a composition in Purbi, a specific dialect of old Hindi.
“I learnt the song by listening to various qawwali [Muslim devotional song] singers singing at Hazrat Nizammuddin’s dargah [shrine] in Delhi,” explains Khan. “Its source is Hazrat Amir Khusrau,” the Sufi poet and philosopher from India. Listen to “Westlin’ Winds” below.



TRACKLIST:01 “Sukhe Phool”02 “The Shearing’s Not For You”03 “Thumri Bhairavi”04 “Westlin’ Winds”05 “Song For Oddur”06 “The North Carr”07 “Twa Brothers”08 “Waliyan Da Raja”09 “Darbari”
