      <p>A teenager has been stabbed following a fight at a vigil to mourn the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/teenager-who-died-after-car-17198052">death of a close friend</a> .</p>
      <p>An 18-year-old was attacked as pals paid their respects to a 17-year-old who died after the car he was in smashed into a building during a police chase.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/teenager-stabbed-during-vigil-friend-17201223">ManchesterEveningNews</a> , police were called to reports of a brawl in the south of the city on Monday.</p>

      <p>The teenager stabbed on Monday night is believed to have been one of Deon's friends - and a pal of the other person injured in the horror smash on Sunday.</p>
