Smashing Pumpkins frontman William Patrick (aka Billy) Corgan announced a new double album, Cotillions, due out later this month, and he just embarked on a solo tour supporting it. That tour kicked off on Monday night (11/4) for the first of three nights at LA’s Lodge Room, where, as Consequence of Sound reports, Billy did two sets of new material, classic and deep cut Pumpkins tracks, a couple of Zwan songs, and couple of covers. The covers included “Little” Jimmy Dickens’ “Another Bridge to Burn,” and, in a particularly interesting choice, Sharon Van Etten’s “Every Time The Sun Comes Up,” from her 2014 album Are We There. Back in August, Billy posted an Instagram story about the SVE song, writing that he’d intended to play it during his last solo tour but that he’d “just never got to it.” We don’t have video of it (please share if you do) but hopefully that cover makes a reappearance at other shows this month.
Among the new tracks that got their North American debut in LA are “Hard Times,” “Cri de Coeur,” and “Dancehall;” watch video of those, as well as a few Pumpkins tracks and Monday night’s setlist, below.
Billy’s tour wraps up with three NYC shows, at Gramercy Theatre on November 18, 19, and 20. There are a few “Official Platinum” tickets left.
