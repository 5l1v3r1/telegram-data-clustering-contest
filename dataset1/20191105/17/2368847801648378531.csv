中共「全過程民主」搞暈全球 外媒連批「羊頭狗肉」

05 Nov 2019, 17:41

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】中共四中全會提出所謂「中國之治」，習近平在上海又提「全過程民主」，這些怪異措辭令全球網民費解。多家外媒紛紛解讀，批評所謂「中國之治」就是專制統治，「全過程民主」不過是「掛羊頭賣狗肉」。
習近平11月2日到訪上海長寧區虹橋街道古北市民中心時，首次提到一個新詞「全過程民主」。他說：「我們走的是一條中國特色社會主義政治發展道路，人民民主是一種全過程的民主。」
不過中共兩大喉舌新華社、《人民日報》刊發習近平講話時，卻刻意刪掉這部分內容，引起網民和外媒對「全過程民主」一詞議論紛紛。

BBC：「全過程民主」就是「中國式民主」

BBC報導說，中共當局提出的「全過程民主」，似有定義「中國式民主」之意。但海外社交媒體上，很多人對「全過程民主」一詞表示不解。一位臉書用戶給BBC留言，「這是中文嗎？怎麼我每個字都看得懂，但連在一起就看不懂了呢。」也有臉書用戶表示，「全過程民主」不過是一種空洞的政治口號。
BBC稱，中共執政以來，一直以經濟成就來強調執政的合法化，在民主、人權等方面屢遭外界詬病。中共一再將「生存權和發展權」放在人權的首要位置，忽略了天賦人權的普世價值，被批評為「中國式人權」。
報導還貼出一張中共全國人大代表申紀蘭舉手按投票器的圖片，圖說寫的是：「中共人大代表申紀蘭自稱從不投反對票，很多次的人大會議上，她都是按下『贊成』鍵。」申紀蘭從中共建政後至今，一直擔任中共全國人大代表，被外界戲稱為中共人大的「活化石」。
中共中央常委前政治秘書鮑彤的女兒鮑簡在推特上表示，「試着對『中國式民主是全過程的民主』做一番解讀：槍杆子奪權前言必稱民主，讓民主成為那時中國人的美好願景。執政後嘴上講民主，橫幅掛民主，憲法提民主，大會小會講民主，文件有民主，好像也有個永遠在野的民主黨派……這算不算全過程啊？」




法廣：中國人民從未享受一天民主

法廣報導說，中共的「全過程民主」說得很動聽，但除了毛澤東當年在延安做「山大王」時呼籲過「要建立美國式民主」，中共建政後沒有實行過一天民主。中共人大選舉都是各級黨組織自上而下指定候選人，每年一次人大投票也不過是舉手機器。
報導稱，中共四中全會公報把所謂「中國之治」的最大特徵表述得一清二楚，那就是中共領導一切。事實上，中國根本不存在一個體現民主方式的制度，怎麼表達民主，怎麼會有一個民主過程？民主的一個最基本的內容是言論自由，中國有嗎？
文章質疑，當局可能把「全過程民主」理解為一級一級黨委報上來的人選、提案，最後由當局拍板的過程認為是「全民主過程」。
文章分析，黨國統治的另一個可怕之處是，人民意識的普遍被強迫性奴役化。中共堵塞言論、封鎖批評的最典型的一句話：「吃我的肉還想砸我的鍋。」但它顛倒了一個基本事實，是中國人民在供養着這個黨國一統的政權，而不是這個政權本身創造着供十幾億人民生活的財富。
文章認為，這四十年，最核心的變化就是中共人民的自由越來越少。中共在互聯網空前發達的今天，還要把一個非人道的、反自由的制度永遠地施加於人民。這個「中國方案」越是具有「現代化」的能力，人民受到的恐懼就越大。

《美國之音》：掛羊頭賣狗肉

《美國之音》引述《北京之春》榮譽主編胡平的分析說，中共官方對「中國之治」的解說非常空洞、語義混亂、含糊不清，還充滿自相矛盾，其實有不少東西根本就是「掛羊頭賣狗肉」。
胡平表示，「中國之治」的本質本應該是法治，但實際上恰恰是法治的反面。因為法治就意味着對政府的權力加以限制，但中共恰恰不受任何限制。儘管當局把「法治」的口號叫得震天響，但「中國之治」的實質實際上就是專制，而且是種非常強化的專制。

The CCP’s ""full-process democracy"" has stunned the world.

05 Nov 2019, 17:41

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the so-called ""governance of China"". Xi Jinping also proposed ""the whole process of democracy"" in Shanghai. These strange words have made the global netizens understand. A number of foreign media have interpreted and criticized the so-called ""governance of China"" as an authoritarian rule. ""The whole process of democracy"" is nothing more than ""selling sheep and selling dog meat.""
When Xi Jinping visited the Gubei Civic Center in Hongqiao Street, Changning District, Shanghai on November 2, he first mentioned a new word, “Full Process Democracy”. He said: ""We are following a path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics. People's democracy is a whole process of democracy.""
However, when the two major mouthpieces of the Chinese Communist Party Xinhua News Agency and the People’s Daily published Xi Jinping’s speech, they deliberately deleted this part of the content, causing netizens and foreign media to talk about the term “democratic whole process”.

BBC: ""Full Process Democracy"" is ""Chinese Democracy""

The BBC reported that the ""full-process democracy"" proposed by the Chinese authorities seems to define ""Chinese-style democracy."" But on overseas social media, many people are puzzled by the term ""global democracy."" A Facebook user gave a message to the BBC. ""Is this Chinese? How can I understand each word, but I can't understand it when I am connected together."" Some Facebook users also said that ""the whole process of democracy"" is nothing but An empty political slogan.
The BBC said that since the CCP took power, it has always emphasized the legalization of its governance with economic achievements, and has repeatedly been criticized by the outside world in terms of democracy and human rights. The CCP has repeatedly placed ""the right to life and development"" at the forefront of human rights, ignoring the universal value of natural human rights and being criticized as ""Chinese-style human rights.""
The report also posted a picture of Shen Jilan, the representative of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, who said that he said: ""The Chinese People's Congress representative Shen Jilan claimed to never vote against it. Many times in the National People's Congress, she pressed ""Yes."" 』Key.” Since the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, Shen Jilan has been the representative of the National People’s Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and has been dubbed the “living fossil” of the CCP’s National People’s Congress.
Bao Jian, the daughter of Bao Zheng, former political secretary of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, said on Twitter: ""Try to explain the ""Chinese democracy is a whole process of democracy"": the foreword of the guns will be called democracy, let democracy become China at that time. A beautiful vision of people. After ruling, democracy is on the banner, democracy is banned in the banner, democracy is promoted in the constitution, democracy is discussed in the small meeting, democracy is in the document, and there seems to be a democratic party that is always in the wild... Is this a whole process?""




Law Guang: The Chinese people have never enjoyed a day of democracy

Fa Guang reported that the ""full-process democracy"" of the CCP was very good, but in addition to Mao Zedong's ""king of the mountain king"" in Yan'an, he called for ""to establish American-style democracy."" After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, there was no one-day democracy. The election of the National People's Congress is a top-down designated candidate for party organizations at all levels. The annual NPC vote is nothing more than a mobile phone.
The report stated that the communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party expressed the clearest feature of the so-called ""governance of China"", that is, the CCP leads everything. In fact, there is no system in China that reflects the democratic way. How to express democracy, how can there be a democratic process? One of the most basic elements of democracy is freedom of speech. Does China have it?
The article questioned that the authorities may interpret ""the whole process of democracy"" as a candidate and proposal from the first-level party committee, and finally the process of making a decision by the authorities is considered a ""full democratic process.""
The article analyzes that another terrible thing about the rule of the party state is that the people's consciousness is generally forced to be enslaved. The most typical sentence of the CCP’s blockage of speech and blockade of criticism: “I still want to lick my pot when I eat my meat.” But it reverses the basic fact that the Chinese people are supporting the regime of the party state, not the regime. It creates wealth for the lives of more than one billion people.
The article believes that the core change in these four decades is that the CCP’s people are less and less free. Today, when the Internet is unprecedentedly developed, the CCP has to impose an inhuman and anti-free system on the people forever. The more the ""China Program"" has the ability to ""modernize"", the greater the fear of the people.

""Voice of America"": hanging sheep's head to sell dog meat

""Voice of America"" quoted Hu Ping, the honorary editor of ""Beijing Spring"", as saying that the CCP's official interpretation of ""the rule of China"" is very empty, semantically confusing, ambiguous, and full of contradictions. In fact, there are many things that are fundamental. It is ""hanging sheep's head and selling dog meat.""
Hu Ping said that the essence of ""the rule of China"" should be the rule of law, but in fact it is precisely the opposite of the rule of law. Because the rule of law means restricting the power of the government, but the CCP does not impose any restrictions. Although the slogan of the ""rule of law"" is called shocking, the essence of ""governance of China"" is actually autocracy, and it is a very intensive dictatorship.
