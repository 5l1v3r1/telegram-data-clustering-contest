A famous shoe manufacturer, Bata has staged a comeback in Nigeria as it launched a new factory worth N350 million in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, to aid local production of footwear in Nigeria.
The manufacturer has employed artisans that have started manufacturing footwear that would soon hit the market.
What it means: The shoemaker that left Nigeria in the 80’s has returned to the most populous black nation and is expected to generate employment for the teeming youth while the internally generated revenue would also witness a boost.



An executive of the company, Tobe Eze, who disclosed during the official visit of some officials of Standard Organisation of Nigeria to the facility, explained that the brand returned to the country last April when it imported some shoes.

He said, “Now, our local shoemakers have started work and we will soon floor the market with our products. We will open another $1million shoe plant at Idu Industrial layout (Abuja) and that will be fully manned by over 128 Nigerians.

“Everybody working here are all Nigerians. We have six people undergoing training as supervisors at the Bata factory. The return of Bata would improve the country’s economy. To have the confidence to partner with us and come back is a good sign also for the country.


“Government is also trying to attract foreign investment; whether direct and indirect. Nigerians can expect what they have always known about Bata. First of all, it is quality and affordability.”

He added that there were plans to expand to other states in the country. “We are also not losing our tradition. We are bringing the old with the new and we are infusing both to satisfy our customers. Measures had been put in place to ensure that the shoe company does not close up shops as it did in the 80s.”
