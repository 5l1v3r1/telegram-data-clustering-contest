Another trophy slipped away from the Buccaneers, who suffered a penalty shoot-out loss to Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the quarter-finals over the weekend.
In the league though, Pirates will be aiming for back-to-back victories for the first time this season after they defeated Highlands Park 1-0 seven days ago in Tembisa.
Rhulani Mokwena is forced in to a change for tonight's encounter as Thembinkosi Lorch will be suspended after picking up his fourth yellow card of the season against Chiefs on Saturday.
Pirates will be coming up against a Maritzburg outfit in superb form as the penalty shoot-out triumph over Highlands Park in the Telkom Knockout extended their winning run to five matches in all competitions.
Maritzburg's league form has certainly picked up after a slow start, as they have won their last three matches without a conceding a goal.
The last time these two sides met, the Buccaneers walked away with a 1-0 victory at the Harry Gwala Stadium.

Here's how they line up:

Pirates: 30. Sandilands, 23. Maela, 4. Jele, 5. Nyauza, 27. Motshwari, 44. Mabaso, 45. Pule, 15. Makaringe, 18. Dlamini, 7. Mhango, 16. Mabasa.
Subs: 40. Mpontshane, 18. Chabalala, 37. Mbekile, 29. Mako, 20. Mlambo, 17. Mulenga, 12. Shonga.
Maritzburg: 30. Ofori, 25. Xulu, 36. Kunene, 5. Morgan, 23. De Reuck, 4. Allie, 45. Mngonyama, 14. Claasen, 26. Shandu, 7. Kutumela, 11. Brockie.
Subs: 31. Mpandle, 4. Sanoka, 19. Moseamedi, 29. Mekoa, 15. Timm, 8. Buchanan, 17. Augusto.
