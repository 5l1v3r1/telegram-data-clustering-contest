      <p>The holiday season is what we’re all looking forward to. Sales! Presents! Eggnog! But with the celebrations, shopping, and last-minute deadlines, the holiday rush can be stressful and overwhelming, not to mention expensive. But! It doesn’t have to be. Whether you're shopping for yourself or need to get a gift for someone else, your search is over. I've rounded up nine unique and creative yet functional and practical <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/7-anthropologie-fall-homeware-items-under-30-to-cozy-up-your-apartment-18566899">holiday home buys you can get at Anthropologie</a> for under $20 — because I don't know about you, but my favorite word is "cheap."</p>
      <p>According to a 2018 survey from <a href="https://lendedu.com/blog/cost-of-christmas/">LendEDU</a>, Americans spent an average of $633 during the holiday season. Based on my calculations, that's approximately $623 too much, give or take. Even if you're a pro at sniffing out the sales, even if you're willing to camp out the night before for Black Friday deals, you'll still rack up a hefty tab — and fast — when it comes to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/50-gifts-for-people-who-are-hard-to-buy-for-3197082">your holiday shopping</a>. Happens every year.</p>
      <p>If you want something that's cute and practical and won't break the bank, head to Anthropologie and grab one of these home buys — all of which you can nab for less than $20.</p>
