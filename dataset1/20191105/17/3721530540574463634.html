      <p>If you’ve played <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> for long enough, then you’ve probably learned how to handle a Lynel just fine. Even so, there are <i>levels </i>to how good you can be at the game.</p>
      <p>Take this short clip uploaded by <a href="https://twitter.com/zb_yuhudaddy/status/1191375836449894402">@zb_yuhudaddy to Twitter</a>, for instance. It begins with the sort of thing you might expect: a parry, some slo-mo hits, what have you. Then he throws the tri-boomerang to swirl around the Lynel. And then he masterfully dodges while leaving a bomb in the Lynel’s attack route. All the while, the boomerang continues to work its magic.</p>

      <p>I kind of feel bad for the Lynel! But perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised that zb_yuhudaddy could pull this off. After all, this is the same player who <a href="https://twitter.com/zb_yuhudaddy/status/1084738686875447297">went viral earlier in the year after deflecting multiple guardian attacks at once.</a></p>
      <p>It seems that zb_yuhudaddy has made a hobby out of humiliating Lynels in particular, though. In a different clip, the <i>Breath of the Wild</i> savant shield surfs, quickly drops a fire, and launches into the air before raining arrows on the Lynel.</p>

      <p>Really, I can’t help but admire the usage of the shield. You get the impression that zb_yuhudaddy doesn’t need to use it, other than to show off. It’s almost like the player is just kick-flipping all over the place while the Lynel is still trying to figure out what’s even happening.</p>

      <p>And one more clip of dominance for good measure:</p>

      <p>God, I love this game.</p>
