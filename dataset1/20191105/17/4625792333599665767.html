      <h1>Kamala Harris hits back at 'nonsense' from Rep. James Clyburn that some black voters are homophobic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:10:29+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Kamala Harris took aim at Democrats who claimed that rival Pete Buttigieg's sexuality would be an issue in the Democratic presidential primary among black voters.</p>
      <p>"I'm never going to buy into that trope. And I think it's a trope that's evolved among some Democrats to suggest that African Americans are homophobic or that there's transphobia in the black community as a community. That’s just nonsense," the California Democrat said Monday on CNN. "I’m not saying that about Representative Clyburn, who I respect a lot. I’m talking about a trope that has developed among some. And the reality is that sadly, and unfortunately, in all communities bias occurs and in particular homophobia and transphobia."</p>
      <p>"To label one community in particular as being burdened by this bias as compared to others is misinformed, it’s misdirected and it’s just simply wrong," Harris added.</p>
      <p>The comments come as Rep. James Clyburn said Sunday that many older black voters <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jim-clyburn-no-question-buttigieg-being-gay-is-an-issue-for-older-black-voters">may not be fans of Buttigieg because he is gay</a>.</p>
      <p>"I know of a lot of people my age that feel that way," Clyburn said on CNN. "I'm not going to sit here and tell you otherwise. I think everybody knows that's an issue."</p>
      <p>The South Bend mayor has struggled with black voters in polls including a focus group by his own campaign <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-buttigieg-focus-group-finds-his-sexuality-problematic-among-black-voters-in-south-carolina">which found his sexuality to be</a> "a barrier" among black voters.</p>
      <p>The 2020 contender is currently polling at 7% in national polls for the Democratic presidential primary according to RealClearPolitics.</p>
