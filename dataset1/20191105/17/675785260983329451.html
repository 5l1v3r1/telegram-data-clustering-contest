      <h1>Strictly's Mike Bushell has perfect comeback to troll saying he won't be a dancer</h1>
      <h2>Mike survived yet another dance off this past weekend and some haven't taken kindly to the judges' decision to save him once again</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:38:50+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing's</a> dance off regular, the BBC's Mike Bushell, has hit back at a troll you told him he would "never be a dancer."</p>
      <p>The 53 year old, who's paired up with pro Katya Jones, has been in the bottom two for three weeks in a row now, and four times in total.</p>
      <p>Some fans have been scratching their heads over the judges' repeated decision to save Mike and let him dance another day.</p>
      <p>Mike took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to post his gratitude to those who've offered cheers and support, writing: "Thank you for great feedback tonight. I did my best and as from week one I can't wait for next week."</p>

      <p>Pretty soon a troll decided they'd have a pop at Mike, penning: "You do your best but you'll never be a dancer, sorry, you should gave gone this week."</p>
      <p>Mike came back with the perfect reply: "Hi Pam. Thanks for this. It's great everyone has their favourites and I respect opinion but for 12 years I've tried to inspire people who think they can't do sport or are rubbish to try a new sport to get fitter.</p>
      <p>"Let's not tell anyone they can't or never will be this or that."</p>

      <p>"Perfect response Mike," one wrote.</p>
      <p>Another gushed: "This is exactly why you are our family favourite @mikebreakfast #inspiration."</p>

      <p>This series of Strictly has seen various judges and contestants met with much more vicious trolling and even death threats.</p>
      <p>Katya even announced her complete departure from social media following threats against Mike's life - they have had some fans angry after ousting Dev Griffin, Catherine Tyldesley and Emma Weymouth during dance offs.</p>
      <p>The dancer told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun on Sunday</a> : "I'm off social media; it's not real.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's real what we're doing with our dancing and performance. There's no need for negatives. I just want to do my own thing."</p>
      <p>Head judge Shirley Ballas has also been the target of threats, describing that one troll had sent her a doctored image of her digging her own grave.</p>
