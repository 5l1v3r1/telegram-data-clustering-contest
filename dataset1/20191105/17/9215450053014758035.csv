【滙豐減息】滙豐帶頭減息 股樓醞釀轉勢
05 Nov 2019, 17:03 by 投資
本週聯儲局議息，一如市場預期減息0.25厘。不過，滙豐減息突然下調最優惠利率，實在出人意料，對於股市投資者、置業人士均有莫大啟示。因應滙豐減息，全港進入減息週期，下文將會率先分析對港股的影響。

美國時間（10月30日），聯儲局召開貨幣政策委員會商討息口走向，最終決定減息0.25厘，至1.5至1.75厘，為年內第三次減息。 不過，聯儲局主席鮑威爾表示現時的貨幣政策合適，暗示未來不會進一步減息。不過，鮑威爾亦留有一手，指出聯儲局將會因應實際情況作出最佳決定。 香港金融管理局總裁余偉文表示，金管局貼現窗基本利率下調0.25厘，至2厘。
滙豐減息屬吸時雨
他指出，美國減息反映聯儲局認為美國以至環球經濟下行風險仍然存在，部分來自國際貿易摩擦的不確定性。 香港作為開放經濟體系受影響較大，故金管局、香港按揭證券有限公司及銀行業界已經推展工作，希望可以協助中小企。
然而，最出人意表的是滙豐帶頭減息，宣佈下調最優惠利率（P），由5.125厘減至5厘（見表一）。滙豐接近10年來再度減息，最優惠利率水平重返金融海嘯爆發前後至今的最位低位。 與此同時，滙豐下調港元存款利率12.4個點子，由0.125厘下調至0.001厘；而美元存款利率亦由0.1厘下調至0.001厘。所有利率調整在週五（11月1日）生效。
滙豐亞太區顧問梁兆基馬上回應協助中小企的訴求，形容是次滙豐減息為「及時雨」。因為近月本地經濟因為社會運動而轉壞，第三季本地生產總值（GDP）按季跌3.2%，已經連續第二季出現按季負增長，香港隨即陷入技術性衰退。 恒生銀行（00011）、中銀香港（02388）、渣打香港及東亞銀行（00023）都先後跟隨減息。 不過，存款基礎相對雄厚的恒生、中銀將其最優惠利率調整至和滙豐看齊，而渣打及東亞等存款規模較細的銀行則將最優惠利率由5.375厘下調至5.25厘。故市場上最優惠利率維持大P及細P格局不變。



 
今次滙豐急不及待減息，反映滙豐要在拆借市場賺取最多息差的意圖明顯。現時港元及美元存款利息降至接近零，而滙豐作為淨拆出銀行，同時又帶頭減息。當拆息水平不變，滙豐的息差就會拉闊，像中銀及恒生亦以同樣原因受惠。 換言之，本地龍頭銀行在拆息市場賺取息差將會拉闊，為香港跟隨減息所出現的新形勢。 另一個新形勢是對港股個別股票的利好作用，減息令投資股票機會成本減少。 何況，鮑威爾已經出聲對環球股市保駕護航，「如有壞消息，聯儲局將減息；若有好消息，也不會加息。」美息只減不加，有利美股破頂。 週四本地銀行意外減息，恒生指數應聲上升239點。翌日恒指再升194點，升穿27,000點關口，再度逼近250天線。
慎防恒指再度「脗別」250天線
不過，須慎防恒指再度「脗別」250天線。因為恒指再度「脗別」250天線，將會下試低位，甚至成為金融海嘯翻版。故現階段難言恒指已經脫險。 本地股較值博 翺騰投資管理（香港）董事總經理祝振駒指出，近日港股市況不太算受到減息預期影響。因為有更重要的因素左右在港上市的中資股及本地股走勢，中資股受貿易戰影響，而本地股則受社會運動影響。 早前有指本地出現走資潮，祝振駒指出屬於人心虛怯所致，實際上本地流動資金仍然充裕。香港始終是開放式市場，富豪早已作出資產配置，在海外購置物業及投資。故不會一窩蜂將資金調去外國。他坦言資金不會「走晒」。
股票平不代表股市會升
話說回來，祝振駒指出，現時香港大部分股票估值不算昂貴，但股票平不代表股市會升。本地股何時回升，視乎社會運動何時落幕。 以前所謂的好股，如領展房產基金（00823）股價動輒跌19.3%，其他股價跌10%至20%的股票也比比皆是，如果股價跌20%，已經進入技術性態市。 之前兩三個月本地股跌，導致中資股相對跑贏大市，但值博率始終是本地股較高。「你估唔到幾時本地股再度跑贏中資股，但本地股已經底，會否橫行一段時間還須確認。
個別地產股已經出現三底
個別地產股已經出現三底，有些甚至見到四底，底部相當硬淨。現時在鑊底向上升少少，但要橫行多少尚待觀察，如果有耐性本地股值博率高。」 祝振駒指亦有坐言起行，本身已持有本地股，但有做淡倉對沖，但之前減少對沖，導致淨持倉增加。

[HSBC cut interest rates] HSBC took the lead in interest rate cuts
05 Nov 2019, 17:03 by Investment
This week, the Fed will raise interest rates, as the market expects to cut interest rates by 0.25%. However, HSBC cut interest rates suddenly cut the most favorable interest rate, it is surprising, for the stock market investors, home buyers have great inspiration. In response to HSBC's interest rate cuts, Hong Kong will enter the interest rate cut cycle. The following will be the first to analyze the impact on Hong Kong stocks.
Written by: Smart ED Editorial Department | Photo: China News Agency Pictures
During the US time (October 30), the Federal Reserve Board held a monetary policy committee to discuss the interest rate, and finally decided to cut interest rates by 0.25% to 1.5 to 1.75%, the third rate cut in the year. However, Fed Chairman Powell said that the current monetary policy is appropriate, suggesting that there will be no further interest rate cuts in the future. However, Powell also left a hand to point out that the Fed will make the best decision based on the actual situation. Yu Weiwen, president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said that the basic interest rate of the HKMA discount window was lowered by 0.25% to 2%.
HSBC cut interest rate is raining
He pointed out that the US interest rate cut reflects the Fed's view that the downside risks of the US and the global economy still exist, partly due to the uncertainty of international trade friction. As an open economy, Hong Kong has been greatly affected. The HKMA, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited and the banking industry have already carried out their work and hope to help SMEs.
However, the most unexpected is that HSBC took the lead in cutting interest rates and announced the reduction of the prime rate (P) from 5.125% to 5% (see Table 1). HSBC has cut interest rates again in the past 10 years, and the best interest rate has returned to the lowest level since the financial tsunami. At the same time, HSBC lowered its Hong Kong dollar deposit interest rate by 12.4 points from 0.125% to 0.001%, while the US dollar deposit rate was also lowered from 0.1% to 0.001%. All interest rate adjustments will take effect on Friday (November 1).
HSBC Asia Pacific consultant Liang Zhaoji immediately responded to the request of SMEs and described HSBC's interest rate cut as ""timely rain"". In recent months, the local economy turned bad due to social movements. In the third quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 3.2% quarter-to-quarter. It has experienced quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter, and Hong Kong immediately fell into a technical recession. Hang Seng Bank (00011), BOC Hong Kong (02388), Standard Chartered Hong Kong and Bank of East Asia (00023) all followed interest rate cuts. However, Hang Seng and Bank of China, which have relatively strong deposit bases, have adjusted their best interest rates to be in line with HSBC, while banks with smaller deposits such as Standard Chartered and East Asia have lowered the prime rate from 5.375% to 5.25%. Therefore, the best interest rate on the market maintains a large P and a fine P pattern.




This time HSBC is eager to cut interest rates, reflecting the obvious intention of HSBC to earn the most spreads in the lending market. At present, interest rates on Hong Kong dollar and US dollar deposits have fallen to near zero, while HSBC has taken the lead in cutting the interest rate. When the level of interest rate remains unchanged, HSBC's spread will widen, and BOC and Hang Seng will benefit for the same reason. In other words, the local leading banks will widen the interest rate spread in the interest-losing market and will create a new situation for Hong Kong to follow interest rate cuts. Another new situation is the positive effect on individual stocks of Hong Kong stocks. The interest rate cut will reduce the opportunity cost of investment stocks. What's more, Powell has already escorted the global stock market. ""If there is bad news, the Fed will cut interest rates. If there is good news, it will not raise interest rates."" The interest rate will only be reduced, and the US stocks will break. The local bank unexpectedly cut interest rates on Thursday, and the Hang Seng Index rose 239 points. The Hang Seng Index rose another 194 points the next day, surpassing the 27,000-point mark and approaching 250 antennas again.
Beware of the HSI again ""screening"" 250 antennas
However, it is necessary to guard against the HSI to ""screen"" the 250 antennas again. Because the HSI once again ""screened"" the 250-antenna, it will test the low position and even become a financial tsunami piracy. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the HSI has escaped from the current stage. The shareholding of local stocks Bo Zhenteng Investment Management (Hong Kong) Managing Director Zhu Zhenduo pointed out that the recent stock market conditions in Hong Kong are not considered to be affected by interest rate cuts. Because there are more important factors affecting the trend of Chinese stocks and local stocks listed in Hong Kong, Chinese stocks are affected by trade wars, while local stocks are affected by social movements. Earlier, there was a wave of local capital movements. Zhu Zhenduo pointed out that it was caused by the guilty conscience. In fact, local liquidity is still abundant. Hong Kong has always been an open market. Regal has already made asset allocations and purchased properties and investments overseas. Therefore, it will not be transferred to foreign countries. He admits that the funds will not ""go in the sun.""
Stock level does not mean that the stock market will rise
In other words, Zhu Zhenduo pointed out that at present, most stocks in Hong Kong are not expensive, but stocks do not mean that the stock market will rise. When local stocks rebound will depend on when the social movement will end. In the past, the so-called good stocks, such as the Link Real Estate Fund (00823), fell 19.3%, and other stocks fell 10% to 20% of stocks. If the stock fell 20%, it has entered the technical market. Local stocks fell in the previous two or three months, causing Chinese stocks to outperform the market, but the value rate was always higher for local stocks. ""When you estimate that local stocks will once again outperform Chinese stocks, but local stocks have already bottomed out, whether it will be rampant for a while needs to be confirmed.
Individual property stocks have already appeared at the bottom
Individual property stocks have already appeared at the bottom, and some even see the bottom, and the bottom is quite hard. At present, there is little increase in the bottom of the market, but it is still to be seen how much it will be rampant. If there is patience, the value of local stocks is high. Zhu Zhenyu also said that he also held a position to hold a local stock, but he did a short position hedge, but reduced hedging before, resulting in an increase in net positions.
