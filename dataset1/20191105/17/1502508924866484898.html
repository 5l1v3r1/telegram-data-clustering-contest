      <h2>India says supports FTA talks with EU after refusing to join China-led accord</h2>

      <p>India should hold talks with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/european-union">European Union </a>for a free trade agreement, the government said on Tuesday, a day after it refused to join a China-backed regional trade pact for fear of a flood of cheap Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>Trade Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-piyush-goyal">Piyush Goyal </a>said sectors such as gems, textiles and agriculture have pushed for a trade pact with the EU. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also called for talks to restart to finalise an agreement.</p>
      <p>"We should engage in a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fta">FTA </a>with the EU," Goyal told a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/economy-policy-news-1020101.htm">news </a>conference where he explained the reasons for not joining the Regional Cooperative Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that 15 nations concluded on Monday.</p>
      <p>Goyal said India had put forward "strong demands" on services, investments leading to the prolonged negotiations for the RCEP, which includes the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, besides China.</p>
