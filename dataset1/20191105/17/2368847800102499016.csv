美商務部長：美中離簽協議「相距甚遠」

05 Nov 2019, 17:39

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】美中原定簽署「第一階段貿易協議」的日期臨近，但雙方敲定協議的高階談判依然遙遙無期。雖然美中官方都在公開釋放「樂觀」信號，但據美媒消息，美國商務部長羅斯剛剛在曼谷的商務會議上透露，離協議還「相距甚遠」。
彭博社報導，當地時間11月4日下午，正在泰國曼谷出席東盟峰會的羅斯，隨同美方代表團會晤了中共國務院總理李克強。在會見李克強前的一次商業論壇上，羅斯表示，美中離「第一階段貿易協議」還「相距甚遠」。
此前一天，羅斯還對彭博社表示樂觀，稱美國將在本月與中方達成初步協議，然後再研究下一階段的協議。
羅斯說，第一階段貿易協議「特別複雜」，美國正確保美中雙方對協議內容有「非常正確、清晰、詳細的理解」，但誰也說不準是否會出現變數。他也透露，如果協議達成，美國愛荷華州、阿拉斯加、夏威夷及中國的一些地方，都可能是美中首腦簽署協議的地點。
羅斯還表示，美企可能很快就能向華為出售部分零件與服務，目前美國政府已收到206份美國公司的許可申請。
美中原定11月中旬在智利的APEC峰會上簽署協議。不過，智利剛剛宣布取消主辦此次峰會，而且美國談判主將趕赴北京敲定協議文本的日程迄今仍未有安排。日前美國貿易代表辦公室宣布，雙方仍有「突出議題」需要解決，副部級談判繼續進行。
上月美方宣布達成「第一階段原則性貿易協議」時，中方曾承諾每年採購400億到500億美元美國農產品。但據英美媒體報導，之後中方將採購量降至200億，並要求美方取消9月1日加徵的關稅，以及12月加徵關稅的計劃。
日前英國《金融時報》也引述消息稱，中方要求美方取消9月1日加徵的關稅，以換取中方加強保護知識產權和增購美國農產品的承諾，以及同意到美國本土舉行協議簽字儀式等。但預計美國的鷹派人士會反對該做法，川普本人是否同意仍是未知數。
彭博社11月4日也報導稱，中方希望，如果習近平訪美簽署協議，這最好能成為國事訪問的一部分。但是也表示，即使不是國事訪問，習近平也會考慮赴美。
中共四中全會剛剛結束，中共官媒就開始新一輪造勢，再次強調美方要照顧中方的「核心關切」，並稱取消關稅是簽署協議的「必要條件」。而此前一個多月中，中共官方一直迴避該話題，並一再強調「中方誠意」。外界評論，四中全會剛過，中共就恢復本來面目，或顯示其拖延和欺騙戰術再次奏效。

US Secretary of Commerce: US-China agreement to sign ""a far cry""

05 Nov 2019, 17:39

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The date of the signing of the ""first-phase trade agreement"" between the United States and China was approaching, but the high-level negotiations on finalizing the agreement were still in the foreseeable future. Although the US and Chinese officials are publicly releasing the ""optimistic"" signal, according to US media, US Commerce Secretary Ross just revealed at the business meeting in Bangkok that it is ""a far cry from the agreement.""
Bloomberg reported that on the afternoon of November 4th, local time, Ross, who was attending the ASEAN summit in Bangkok, Thailand, met with the US delegation and met with Premier Li Keqiang. In a business forum before meeting with Li Keqiang, Ross said that the United States and China are still far apart from the ""first-phase trade agreement.""
The previous day, Ross also expressed optimism to Bloomberg, saying that the United States will reach a preliminary agreement with China this month and then study the next phase of the agreement.
Ross said that the first phase of the trade agreement is ""very complicated."" The United States is ensuring that the United States and China have a ""very correct, clear, and detailed understanding of the agreement,"" but no one can say whether there will be variables. He also revealed that if the agreement is reached, some places in the United States, Iowa, Alaska, Hawaii and China may be the venue for the US-China summit to sign the agreement.
Ross also said that US companies may soon be able to sell some parts and services to Huawei. Currently, the US government has received 206 license applications from US companies.
The United States and China originally scheduled an agreement at the APEC summit in Chile in mid-November. However, Chile has just announced the cancellation of the summit, and the schedule of the US negotiating host to rush to Beijing to finalize the agreement has not yet been arranged. A few days ago, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced that there are still ""prominent issues"" on both sides that need to be resolved, and the deputy ministerial level negotiations continue.
When the US announced last month that it had reached the ""first-phase principled trade agreement,"" China had promised to purchase 40 to 50 billion US dollars of US agricultural products each year. However, according to British and American media reports, after the Chinese side reduced the purchase volume to 20 billion, and asked the US to cancel the tariffs imposed on September 1, and the plan to impose tariffs in December.
Recently, the British ""Financial Times"" also quoted the news that China asked the US to cancel the tariffs imposed on September 1, in exchange for China's commitment to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights and purchase of US agricultural products, and agreed to hold a signing ceremony for the agreement in the United States. However, it is expected that American hawks will oppose this practice. Whether Trump himself agrees is still unknown.
Bloomberg also reported on November 4 that China hopes that if Xi Jinping visits the US to sign an agreement, it would be better to be part of the state visit. But also said that even if it is not a state visit, Xi Jinping will consider going to the United States.
The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has just ended. The Chinese Communist Party’s official media has begun a new round of resurgence. It once again emphasizes that the US side should take care of China’s ""core concerns"" and said that the elimination of tariffs is a ""necessary condition"" for signing the agreement. In the past month or so, the CCP official has been evading the topic and has repeatedly emphasized ""Chinese sincerity."" Outsiders commented that the Fourth Plenary Session has just passed, and the CCP has restored its original features, or has shown that its procrastination and deception tactics have once again worked.
