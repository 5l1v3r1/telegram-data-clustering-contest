美退出巴黎氣候協定 日後想重返未必容易

（中央社華盛頓4日綜合外電報導）美國今天正式通知聯合國他們將退出巴黎氣候協定。世界最大經濟體美國成為這個協定的唯一退群成員，部分美國國內人士憂心，美國對抗全球暖化的信譽將蒙受難以彌補的損失。
法新社報導，美方依照前總統歐巴馬（Barack Obama）談成的協定規定，於可以提出退出的首日便向聯合國提交正式通知信函，代表美國將於2020年11月4日、美國2020總統大選後隔天正式退出巴黎氣候協定。
● 退出理由－氣候協定不利美國商業
美國國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）發表聲明指出，美國將提倡「理想且務實的典範」，既包含再生能源也保留化石燃料的角色。他接受福斯財經新聞網訪問時也重申總統川普2017年的論點，認為巴黎氣候協定不利美國商界，「是美國在蒙受束縛，典型對美國勞工與民眾不公」。
巴黎氣候協定設下的目標，是要讓地球氣溫上升幅度，控制在與工業時代前相比最多攝氏2度內的範圍。科學家認為，這個目標是遏止全球暖化帶來像旱澇頻傳與極端暴風等最嚴重侵害的關鍵。
已轉為環保與氣候尖兵的美國前副總統高爾（Al Gore）譴責川普這項決定，但說總統換人當就能在30天內重返巴黎氣候協定，「沒有哪個人或哪個黨能阻止我們解決氣候危機的態勢。阻撓我們的人，他們犧牲地球以滿足自身貪婪所表現的驕傲、串謀與謊言，終將為人們所牢記」。
● 對抗暖化找備案 中印被寄望
「紐約時報」報導，雖然美國是否會全然退出巴黎氣候協定，最終端看2020大選結果而定，但支持協定人士坦言，必須為一個沒有美國出手配合的未來預作打算。協定談判期間擔任法國氣候變遷大使的杜比安納（Laurence Tubiana）說：「是啊，確有相關討論，不談才是瘋了。我們正為備案做準備。」
各國也開始做相應的外交策略調整。沒有美國的協定若想有效運作，將需像中國、印度等其他汙染大國加速減排；目前是溫室氣體最大排放國的中國已做了可觀承諾，但能否達標尚待觀察。根據聯合國規定，中印被視為開發中國家，其實沒有遵守減排的義務。
● 美退出後只能當觀察員 想重返恐不易
美國今天向聯合國提交退出函，將讓川普能在明年大選後隔天正式率美退出巴黎氣候協定，美國仍可參與氣候協定的討論與進程，但會被降級為觀察員。
巴黎氣候協定是第2個美國由民主黨率領下加入、再由共和黨宣告退出的氣候變遷相關協議，前一次是共和黨籍總統小布希率美退出1997年的京都議定書；分析家警告，即便2020美國選出民主黨籍的新總統，重返巴黎氣候協定也未必平順。
歐巴馬政府時代擔任國務院氣候變遷特使的潘興（Jonathan Pershing）表示，民主黨政府若要重返，巴黎氣候協定屆時很可能會要求美國政府提出具體政策配套，以展現美國如何打算棄用化石燃料，即便提出，其他國家仍會懷疑，美國會否下次大選翻盤後又變卦。（譯者：陳亦偉/核稿：蔡佳敏）1081105

The United States withdraws from the Paris climate agreement. It may not be easy to return in the future.
05 Nov 2019, 17:54 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, comprehensive foreign news report) The United States today officially notified the United Nations that they will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The United States, the world's largest economy, has become the only member of this agreement. Some Americans are worried that the US's reputation against global warming will suffer irreparable damage.
Agence France-Presse reported that the United States submitted a formal notification letter to the United Nations on the first day of the withdrawal, in accordance with the agreement negotiated by former President Barack Obama, on behalf of the United States on November 4, 2020, the United States 2020 The official exit of the Paris climate agreement the next day after the presidential election.
● Reason for withdrawal - climate agreement is not good for American business
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the United States will promote an ""ideal and pragmatic model"" that includes both renewable energy and fossil fuels. In his interview with Flowserve Financial News, he also reiterated President Trump's 2017 argument that the Paris climate agreement is not favorable to the American business community. ""It is the United States that is bound, and is typically unfair to American labor and the public.""
The goal of the Paris Climate Agreement is to increase the temperature of the Earth's temperature to a range of up to 2 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era. Scientists believe that this goal is to stop the global warming from bringing the most serious violations such as droughts and floods and extreme storms.
Former US Vice President Al Gore, who has turned to environmental protection and climate change, condemned Trump’s decision, but said the president’s substitution would return to the Paris climate agreement within 30 days. “No one or party. It can stop us from solving the climate crisis. Those who obstruct us, they sacrifice the earth to satisfy their pride, conspiracy and lies, will be remembered by people.""
● Looking for a record against the warming
The New York Times reported that although the United States will completely withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, and the final terminal depends on the results of the 2020 election, the supporters have frankly stated that they must make plans for a future without US cooperation. Laurence Tubiana, who served as French climate change ambassador during the negotiations of the agreement, said: ""Yes, there is a discussion. It is crazy to talk about it. We are preparing for the record.""
Countries have also begun to make corresponding adjustments in their diplomatic strategies. If there is no US agreement to operate effectively, it will need to accelerate emissions reductions like other polluting countries such as China and India. China, which is currently the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has made considerable promises, but it is yet to be seen whether it can reach the target. According to the UN regulations, China and India are regarded as developing countries and in fact do not comply with the obligation to reduce emissions.
● After the US exits, it can only be an observer.
The United States today submitted an exit letter to the United Nations, which will allow Trump to officially withdraw from the Paris climate agreement the next day after the general election next year. The United States can still participate in the discussion and progress of the climate agreement, but will be downgraded to an observer.
The Paris Climate Agreement is the second climate change agreement that the United States has joined under the leadership of the Democratic Party and then retired by the Republican Party. The previous time was Republican President George W. Bush’s exit from the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. Analysts warned that even The 2020 US election of a new Democratic president, the return to the Paris climate agreement may not be smooth.
Jonathan Pershing, the special envoy for climate change at the time of the Obama administration, said that if the Democratic government wants to return, the Paris climate agreement will likely ask the US government to propose specific policies to show how the United States intends to abandon fossils. Fuel, even if it is proposed, other countries will still doubt whether the United States will change after the next general election. (Translator: Chen Yiwei / Approved: Cai Jiamin) 1081105
