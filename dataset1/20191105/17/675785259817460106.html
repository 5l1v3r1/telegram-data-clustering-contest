      <h2>A fish and chip shop is taking Christmas food to another level by serving up deep fried Quality Street sweets to their customers during December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:23:38+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>It seems that in 2019, fish and chip shops will not rest until they have battered and deep fried everything.</p>
      <p>Recently we saw one establishment start serving up <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/chip-shop-making-battered-jaffa-20149110">battered Jaffa Cakes</a> and now another is deep frying a classic <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> treat for customers.</p>
      <p>Poppies of Soho is going to be offering battered Quality Street sweets to customers throughout December.</p>
      <p>Yes, really.</p>
      <p>From December 1 up until December 25 (They'll be open for a festive fish feast at Christmas), the London-based eatery will be selling "lucky dips" of the deep fried Nestle treats for £2.50.</p>

      <p>For this price each customer will get five different <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food">sweets.</a></p>
      <p>But will you manage to get one of your favourites?</p>
      <p>Quality Streets are made up of 12 different chocolate treats, including the Toffee Finger, the Green Triangle and Strawberry Delight.</p>
      <p>As well as frying the sweets, the team over at Poppies have also gone one step further and shared their ultimate ranking of the best ones. Do you think they've made the right call?</p>

      <p>While the sweets are on offer, staff at the shop will be asking customers to share their opinions and will keep a tally of the most popular flavours.</p>
      <p>Some of the most popular could possibly become permanent features on the menu.</p>
      <p>Fans of the fish and chip shop on social media were very excited by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chocolate">chocolate</a> news.</p>
