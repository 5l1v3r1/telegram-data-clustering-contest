Microsoft Launcher might get rid of Cortana very soon
05 Nov 2019, 17:29 by Raka
Microsoft Launcher may soon get rid of Cortana and in case you forgot, Cortana is Microsoft’s digital assistant. According to Zac Bowden at Windows Central, Microsoft might soon pull its digital assistant from Microsoft Launcher on Android and this could happen within the next couple of months.



If this turns out to be true, you’ll no longer be able to ask Cortana to tell you a bad joke from Microsoft Launcher. However, if you still want to use Microsoft’s digital assistant, you’ll need to install Microsoft’s standalone Cortana app on your Android smartphone.
In place of Cortana, Microsoft could integrate Google Assistant to Microsoft Launcher and while the software giant is unlikely to do that, Google Assistant in Microsoft’s Android Launcher is something that will be very interesting as well as useful.
