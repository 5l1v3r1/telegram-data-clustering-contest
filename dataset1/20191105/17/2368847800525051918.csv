川普首將香港納入印太戰略：保障言論和集會自由

05 Nov 2019, 17:48

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】本屆東盟峰會上，川普（特朗普）特使批評中共的「新帝國主義」，美國國務院發表報告闡述川普政府「印太戰略」實施進度時，也譴責中共將對國內的壓迫輸出到其它地區。報告還敦促中共遵守《中英聯合聲明》，保障香港人權。
第35屆東盟系列峰會11月4日在泰國曼谷閉幕。作為系列峰會的一部份，美國發起的「印太商業論壇」於4日舉行。美國國務院在論壇上發布了名為《一個自由開放的印度-太平洋：推進共享願景》的報告，詳細闡述川普政府「印太戰略」的實施進度。
在這份報告關於「良善治理」的部份，美國政府直接批評中共在國內和國外採取的壓迫行為。報告說，「北京不容忍異議、積極控制媒體和公民社會，並且殘酷鎮壓少數民族和宗教。北京也將這種做法通過其政治和經濟影響力輸出到其他國家，破壞了數十年來促進印太地區穩定繁榮的狀況。」
在關於香港的部份，報告呼籲北京必須遵守1984年《中英聯合聲明》的承諾，維持香港的自治與公民自由。「我們認為香港及整個印太地區的言論自由與和平集會，必須受到強有力的保障。」報告並指，美國已公開呼籲中共停止對新疆少數民族的殘酷鎮壓，也不要干預藏人挑選宗教領導人。
有港媒評論稱，美國國務院這份報告公開提及香港，具有象徵性意義，代表川普政府已將香港問題列入其「印太戰略」，未來可能就香港局勢對中共加緊施壓。
近期以來，美國國會力推多個涉香港法案，旨在遏制中共對港人民主抗爭的血腥鎮壓。10月中旬，《香港人權和民主法案》已在眾議院一致通過。該法案也於9月下旬在參議院外交委員會獲得通過，但目前仍未提交全院表決。
本屆東盟峰會，美國代表團由川普特使、白宮安全顧問奧布萊恩帶隊。11月4日，奧布萊恩也在峰會上暗諷中共奉行「新帝國主義」以及「強權即是公理」。
他還表示，美國對印太地區有長遠且堅定的承諾，尊重他國主權、支持和平解決爭端、尊重國際法、支持航行和飛行自由。川普總統也在尋求美國和中國的良好關係，但是，如果發生對這個區域或對美國盟友不公平的行為，美國並不怕指出來。
美國國務院4日的報告還表示，川普政府正在深化與印太地區理念相近國家的夥伴關係，包括同盟國、東盟與印度等。此外，美國也和湄公河地區的國家、太平洋島國、南亞國家，以及澳大利亞、新西蘭、日本、台灣和其他夥伴共同面對新興挑戰。
報告在關於「雙邊夥伴關係」的部份指出，美國對印太地區的願景和作為，「緊密結合」了日本的「自由開放印太概念」、印度的「東進政策」、澳大利亞的「印太概念」、韓國的「新南方政策」，以及台灣的「新南向政策」緊密結合。
除了香港外，報告還多次提及強化美國和中華民國的關係，以應對中共在軍事、經濟、外交方面對台灣的霸凌。

05 Nov 2019, 17:48

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] At the current ASEAN summit, Trump's special envoy criticized the CCP's ""new imperialism"". The US State Department issued a report on the implementation progress of the Trump administration's ""Indo-Pacific strategy"". At the time, it also condemned the CCP’s export of domestic oppression to other regions. The report also urges the CCP to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and protect human rights in Hong Kong.
The 35th ASEAN Series Summit closed on November 4th in Bangkok, Thailand. As part of the series of summits, the ""Indian Business Forum"" initiated by the United States was held on the 4th. The US State Department issued a report entitled ""A Free and Open India-Pacific: Advancing Shared Vision"" at the forum, detailing the implementation progress of the Trump administration's ""Indo-Pacific Strategy.""
In this report on ""good governance,"" the US government directly criticized the CCP's oppressive actions at home and abroad. The report said, ""Beijing does not tolerate dissent, actively control the media and civil society, and brutally suppress ethnic minorities and religions. Beijing has also exported this practice to other countries through its political and economic influence, undermining decades to promote India. The region is stable and prosperous.""
In the section on Hong Kong, the report calls on Beijing to abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties. ""We believe that freedom of speech and peaceful assembly in Hong Kong and the entire Indo-Pacific region must be strongly protected."" The report also stated that the United States has publicly appealed to the CCP to stop the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and not to interfere with Tibetans' choice of religious leadership. people.
Some Hong Kong media commented that the US State Department’s report publicly mentioned Hong Kong is symbolic. On behalf of the Trump administration, the Hong Kong issue has been included in its ""Indo-Pacific strategy."" In the future, the CCP may be pressured on the situation in Hong Kong.
Recently, the US Congress has pushed a number of Hong Kong-related laws to curb the bloody suppression of the CCP’s democratic struggle against Hong Kong people. In mid-October, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on Human Rights and Democracy was unanimously passed in the House of Representatives. The bill was also passed in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in late September, but has not yet been submitted to the House of Representatives for voting.
At this ASEAN summit, the US delegation was led by Trump special envoy and White House security adviser O'Brien. On November 4th, O'Brien also sneered at the summit that the CCP pursued ""new imperialism"" and ""power is justice.""
He also stated that the United States has a long-term and firm commitment to the Indo-Taiwan region, respecting the sovereignty of other countries, supporting the peaceful settlement of disputes, respecting international law, supporting navigation and freedom of flight. President Trump is also seeking good relations between the United States and China, but the United States is not afraid to point out if it is unfair to the region or to its allies.
The US State Department’s report on the 4th also stated that the Trump administration is deepening its partnership with countries with similar ideas in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Allies, ASEAN and India. In addition, the United States faces emerging challenges with countries in the Mekong region, Pacific island countries, South Asian countries, and Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, and other partners.
In the section on ""Bilateral Partnerships"", the report points out that the United States' vision and actions in the Indo-Pacific region are ""closely integrated"" with Japan's ""free and open Indian concept"", India's ""eastward policy"", and Australia's ""Indo-Taiwan."" The concept, South Korea’s ""New South Policy"" and Taiwan's ""New Southward Policy"" are closely integrated.
In addition to Hong Kong, the report has repeatedly mentioned strengthening the relationship between the United States and the Republic of China in order to deal with the CCP’s hegemony against Taiwan in military, economic and diplomatic aspects.
