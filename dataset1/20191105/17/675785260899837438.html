      <h1>Arsene Wenger responds to speculation linking ex-Arsenal boss with Bayern Munich job</h1>
      <h2>Arsene Wenger, 70, won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups during his time as Arsenal manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:39:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has sensationally thrown his hat into the ring to become the new Bayern Munich manager.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old won three Premier League titles — including in 2003-04 when his 'Invincibles' went unbeaten for an entire season — and seven FA Cups during his time as Gunners' boss.</p>
      <p>The legendary Frenchman ultimately saw his 22-year reign come to an emotional conclusion at the end of the 2017/18 campaign, and was replaced by Spanish boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>He has remained out of managerial work since but has now hinted that he is ready for a stunning return to the dugout with German giants Bayern, who sacked Niko Kovac over the weekend.</p>
      <p>When asked whether it is a job that interests him, the French replied: "Of course.</p>

      <p>"Coaching is what was my whole life until now. Everybody who has coached will tell you the same. You miss the intensity but some things you miss a lot, some things you don't miss. I enjoy the things I don't miss too much...</p>
      <p>"But on the other hand, football games, winning football games, preparing the team for the game, and getting satisfaction and shared emotions. That is something that you miss.</p>
      <p>"So of course, yes. I was responsible from 33 years of age and I coached until 69 without interuption. And at a top level.</p>
      <p>"It's 36 years without stopping. Even if I miss it, to get out of that pressure for a year was not too bad for me. People who know me well say I'm more relaxed - and it's true."</p>

      <p>Bayern parted company with coach Kovac last weekend after 18 months in charge.</p>
      <p>A statement on the club website said the decision was by mutual agreement, with the Bundesliga champions down in fourth place having lost 5-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Kovac, a former Bayern midfielder, led the side to the league and cup double in May, becoming the first man to achieve the feat as a player and manager.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager Jose Mourinho, also out of work, is currently the bookies favourite to take charge at the Allianz Arena.</p>
