'Just withdraw' - Liverpool fans react to latest Aston Villa decision
Aston Villa latest news | Dean Smith’s side will play their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Liverpool at Villa Park just 24 hours before the Reds are in Club World Cup action in Qatar

Aston Villa’s Carabao Cup quarter-final with Liverpool will take place on Tuesday, December 17 (7.45pm).
Uncertainty had surrounded the last-eight clash due to the Reds’ involvement in the club World Cup during December.
Jurgen Klopp’s side play in the semi-final a day after the scheduled quarter-final against Villa, and Liverpool today (Tuesday) confirmed their intention to play one team at Villa Park and another 24 hours later in Qatar.
“As a result, we will be utilising two playing squads simultaneously, with one squad participating in the FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar and another in the Carabao Cup,” a Liverpool statement read.


Jurgen Klopp (L) and Dean Smith look on

Here’s what the Liverpool fans have made of the decision.
@Luke_Chidlow4: We’re definitely playing a youth team in the quarter final.
@SamueILFC: Can’t wait to beat Aston Villa with our under 18’s and Andy Lonergan.
@LFCAaron_: Joke.
 
@rauidri: Punished for being successful.
@zerscna: So we’re actually splitting the team wow.
@socallfc: Would be a great statement if we just withdraw lol.
@ijc: Laughable. Field an under 18's. Exactly the reason why no-one cares about this tin pot cup anymore. This is a joke.
