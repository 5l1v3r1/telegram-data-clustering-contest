Even with a $1,200 graphics card, you still can’t max out RDR2 on PC

With Red Dead Redemption 2 now available on Windows PC, graphics card manufacturer Nvidia has announced its guidance for hitting 4K at 60 frames per second. Turns out that even its most expensive consumer-level GPU, the roughly $1,200 GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, can’t get there at the highest settings. That means there’s plenty of headroom for driver optimizations, and/or the next generation of GPUs.
Those lucky folks who aren’t dealing with crashes are already off and running, and most seem pleased with the results. We certainly were during our controlled 4K60 demo last month. But, as it turns out, we weren’t actually playing at the highest settings. As Nvidia revealed in its blog post, the press was working with a mix of medium and high settings at 4K.

If you’re dead-set on goosing all the bells and whistles, Nvidia rendering at a lower resolution, either 3264x1836 or 2880x1620, and upscaling to 4K for “a sizeable performance improvement, and only a minimal reduction in image clarity.” Coupled with the company’s new latency and sharpening tech, it sounds like a decent solution. At the very least, be sure to update your drivers, as Nvidia thoughtfully dropped a day-zero patch on Monday.
