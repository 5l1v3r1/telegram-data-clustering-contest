      <p>If you're in the market for a smart 4K TV with a screen big enough to comfortably fill up most rooms, then <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tcl-65-class-led-4-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr-roku-tv/6323856.p?skuId=6323856">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-65-Class-4K-Ultra-HD-2160P-HDR-Roku-Smart-LED-TV-65S425/809029778">Walmart</a> are offering a great deal on a 65" TCL 4K Roku smart TV for $450 ($50 off). TCL is well-known for making great budget TVs that can handle mixed usage very well and this one is no exception.</p>
      <p>This particular model, the 65S425, is a 2019 production model that comes with several features you'd expect from a modern TV â€” 4K resolution with support for HDR10, Roku TV with several streaming apps built-in, support for both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, and enough ports on the back to connect your console or PC to (3x HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2, 1x headphone, 1x optical).</p>

      <p>When the TV gurus at <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/best/by-price/under-500">RTings.com reviewed this model</a>, they named it the best value TV for the size, giving it points for having a decent picture quality with deep blacks when consuming media. Thanks to the TV's 120 Hz refresh rate and low input lag, they also deemed it well-suited for both HDR gaming and general PC usage.</p>
      <p>If you've been wanting to replace that aging non-4K TV or just want to add another one for not a lot of coin, then head over to <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tcl-65-class-led-4-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr-roku-tv/6323856.p?skuId=6323856">Best Buy</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-65-Class-4K-Ultra-HD-2160P-HDR-Roku-Smart-LED-TV-65S425/809029778">Walmart</a> before supplies run out.</p>
