      <p>"As much as I am happy to be among the people I love and be able to see the sky again, this is no time for jubilation," Altan <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/turkey-ahmet-altan-and-nazli-ilicak-released-but-judicial-harassment-continues/">told</a> media outlet ARTICLE 19 upon his release. </p>
      <p>"It is hard to receive the news of one's release when you're among other innocent people - thousands of them - who are being kept in prison unjustly," he added.</p>
      <p>The two journalists were ordered freed for time already served - about three years each. Both were also ordered not to leave the country. </p>
      <p>Altan and Ilicak were sentenced to life in prison in 2018, but the top criminal appeals court overturned the ruling in July this year. </p>
      <p>The pair were convicted of aiding the network of US-based Muslim scholar <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/fethullah-gulen.html">Fethullah Gulen</a>, whom Turkish officials identified as the mastermind of a failed 2016 coup.</p>
      <p>Altan and Ilicak denied any involvement calling such accusations "grotesque". </p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> accuses former ally-turned-foe Gulen of having ordered the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/turkey-attempted-coup.html">attempted coup</a> and lists his movement as a "terrorist" organisation. Gulen has strongly denied any involvement in the failed coup bid. <br/><br/>Altan, 69, is a novelist and journalist who founded the opposition Taraf newspaper, which has since shut down. Ilicak, 74, is a former MP who wrote for leading newspapers including Hurriyet. </p>
