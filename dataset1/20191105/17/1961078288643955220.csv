Will the last one to leave turn out the lights?
The departures from G/O Media kept coming Tuesday, with the resignation of the digital publishing group’s editorial director, Paul Maidment, who had been with the company since June.
He told the staff he was out, effective immediately, in an email. His departure followed a week of chaos during which the entire editorial team resigned from Deadspin, a sports website operated by G/O Media.

They published a post critical of the ads at the G/O media outlets — an article that soon disappeared, apparently scrubbed by the company’s managers, the staff union said.
The staff exodus occurred after the firing of the Deadspin interim editor in chief, Barry Petchesky, who refused to go along with the “stick to sports” edict. The last Deadspin staff member stepped down Friday.
In an interview on Friday, Jim Spanfeller, the chief executive of G/O Media, vowed that Deadspin would continue. A G/O Media spokesman said in a statement that the company would “expedite the search for a new editorial director” to take Mr. Maidment’s place.
