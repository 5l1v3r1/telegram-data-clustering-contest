      <p>BuyDig is shaving $600 off of the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">regular price</a> of the Microsoft Surface Pro 6. That brings the price down to just $699 – for almost half off of its regular price.</p>
      <p>This is for the Surface Pro 6 with the Intel Core i5 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That's a pretty decent tablet for this price, actually. Not to mention the fact that this is normally $1299.</p>
      <p>It has a 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, which does make it a bit taller than most other tablets and laptops. But it does make it easier to use for browsing the web, since it is taller. It has a touchscreen, since this is a tablet that is looking to replace your laptop, that makes plenty of sense. And at 12.3-inches, it's not super large, so you can actually use it as a tablet.</p>

      <p>The whole thing about the Surface Pro 6 is the fact that this is a much lighter computer that you can take back and forth to school or work, without having to compromise on the performance of your computer. And that's what the Surface Pro 6 provides. It's pretty powerful and comes with a full version of Windows 10 – in fact, it's the same version that is available on any other Windows-powered computer. So there's no corners cut here.</p>
      <p>Now, the only downside here, is that this does not come with the TouchType cover in the box. You'll need to pay a bit extra for the TouchType cover. But that shouldn't be too big of a deal, they do usually go for around $129.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 from BuyDig right now <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7692744/type/dlg/https://www.buydig.com/shop/product/MSKJT00001/Microsoft-KJT-00001-Surface-Pro-6-123-Intel-i5-8250U-8GB256GB-SSD-Convertible-Laptop">by clicking here</a>. This price isn't going to last long, and likely won't be any cheaper when Black Friday comes around later this month. So now's the time to grab one.</p>
