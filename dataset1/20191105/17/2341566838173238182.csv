（中央社記者王承中台北5日電）國防部今天表示，一架美籍MC-130型機，於午間沿台海中線以東，由北向南飛行，國防部全程充分掌握，期間並無異常狀況。
從去年7月國防部首度發布美國軍艦通過台灣海峽的訊息後，至今幾乎每個月底都會有美艦通過台灣海峽，然而今年10月卻沒有任何美艦通過台海的消息。
國防部下午發布新聞稿表示，一架美籍MC-130型機，於午間沿台海中線以東，由北向南飛行，國防部全程充分掌握，嚴密監控，期間並無異常狀況。
國防部指出，對於台海周邊各國機、艦活動，國軍均能有效掌握，適切應處，籲請民眾放心。
MC-130型機是台灣空軍C-130型運輸機的衍生機種，主要用於特種作戰，運載特種部隊進行滲透，也可進行空中加油，配備夜視設備、地形跟蹤雷達和電子干擾設備，同型機曾在8月29日、9月27日飛越台海。（編輯：楊凱翔）1081105

(Central News Agency reporter Wang Chengzhong, Taipei, 5th) The Ministry of National Defense said today that an American-made MC-130 aircraft was flying eastward along the central line of the Taiwan Strait at midday and flying from north to south. The Ministry of National Defense fully grasped the whole process and there was no abnormal situation during the period.
Since the Ministry of National Defense first released the news that the US warships passed through the Taiwan Strait in July last year, there will be US ships passing through the Taiwan Strait almost every month. However, in October this year, there was no news of the US ships passing through the Taiwan Strait.
In the afternoon, the Ministry of National Defense issued a press release stating that an American-made MC-130 aircraft was flying eastward along the central line of the Taiwan Strait at midday and flying from north to south. The Ministry of National Defense fully grasped it and closely monitored it during the period.
The Ministry of National Defense pointed out that for the activities of the countries and ships around the Taiwan Strait, the national army can effectively grasp and suit the situation, and appeal to the people to rest assured.
The MC-130 is a derivative of the Taiwan Air Force C-130 transport aircraft. It is mainly used for special operations, carrying special forces for infiltration, and can also be used for aerial refueling. It is equipped with night vision equipment, terrain tracking radar and electronic interference equipment. He flew over the Taiwan Strait on August 29 and September 27.
