9 Anthropologie Home Buys For The Holidays That Are Under $20

05 Nov 2019, 17:27

The holiday season is what we’re all looking forward to. Sales! Presents! Eggnog! But with the celebrations, shopping, and last-minute deadlines, the holiday rush can be stressful and overwhelming, not to mention expensive. But! It doesn’t have to be. Whether you're shopping for yourself or need to get a gift for someone else, your search is over. I've rounded up nine unique and creative yet functional and practical holiday home buys you can get at Anthropologie for under $20 — because I don't know about you, but my favorite word is ""cheap.""
According to a 2018 survey from LendEDU, Americans spent an average of $633 during the holiday season. Based on my calculations, that's approximately $623 too much, give or take. Even if you're a pro at sniffing out the sales, even if you're willing to camp out the night before for Black Friday deals, you'll still rack up a hefty tab — and fast — when it comes to your holiday shopping. Happens every year.
If you want something that's cute and practical and won't break the bank, head to Anthropologie and grab one of these home buys — all of which you can nab for less than $20.
