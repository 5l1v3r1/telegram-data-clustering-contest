      <p>While there are plenty of ways to connect with your loved ones who are far away through social media and video calls, nothing beats the power of touch when it comes to letting someone know that you’re thinking of them. Amazingly, there's a <a href="https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/long-distance-touch-bracelet-set">long distance bracelet set</a> that’ll send your love to someone special, even if many miles separate you.</p>
      <p>This set features two simple yet stylish bracelets, and all that you need to do to connect them is download an app. This allows you to send what they refer to as a "bond touch." But how? Simple. Just tap your bracelet. Once you do that, your loved one’s bracelet will light up and vibrate, letting them know that you’re thinking of them. They can respond back in kind — plus, this bracelet set will allow you to send up to 10 taps, so you and your partner can create your own secret codes and send messages to one another easily. Who doesn't love a good secret code?</p>
      <p>These bracelets are waterproof (so you can wear them anywhere) and they're also rechargeable and easy to clean and maintain. Even if you're across state lines or on opposite coasts (or maybe you just want a way to connect when you're both at work), you can still <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-make-long-distance-relationships-work-according-to-experts-7541785">stay close to those who matter</a>.</p>
