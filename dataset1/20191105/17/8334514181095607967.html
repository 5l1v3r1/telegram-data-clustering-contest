      <p>The woman, holidaying on a sailboat near the Greek island of Folegandros, boarded an inflatable boat around midday on Nov. 1 to get supplies. A day later, Greek authorities were alerted that she was missing.</p>
      <p>They found her in the boat on Sunday morning some 40 nautical miles southwest of Folegandros, close to the island of Crete. Seven coastguard vessels, three private boats, a plane, and a helicopter were involved in the search operation.</p>
      <p>“I was blown away, blown away in my dinghy,” she said as she disembarked a coastguard vessel at the port of Iraklion, on Crete, where she received medical care as a precaution.</p>
      <p>While out at sea she relied on candy for a meal, a coastguard official told Reuters without disclosing her identity or further details. Local media reported that she is an experienced sailor from New Zealand.</p>
