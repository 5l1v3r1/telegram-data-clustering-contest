Liverpool Will Play Two Games In Two Days In December
05 Nov 2019, 17:12 by Robert Redmond

Liverpool will play two games in the space of 24 hours in December after the EFL confirmed that the date of Carabao Cup quarter-final will not change.

Jurgen Klopp’s team will play Aston Villa on Tuesday, December 17 at Villa Park in the EFL Cup. The following day, they will play in the Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar.



Klopp said after Liverpool beat Arsenal on penalties in the previous round of the EFL Cup that they would not play both fixtures in such a short space of time.
However, Liverpool announced on Tuesday evening that they will use two entirely different squads for the ties.
It will be the first time since December 1986 that the club have played two games in two days.



Liverpool released a statement on the situation, which reads:
“We would like to thank the EFL for their efforts to accommodate us and we can confirm alternative dates were discussed, but ultimately none were considered suitable without compromising the scheduling of the competition itself or placing an undue strain on our playing staff.
“As a result, we will be utilising two playing squads simultaneously, with one squad participating in the Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar and another in the Carabao Cup.
“The club would like to take this opportunity to underline that while this is not an ideal scenario, it is an outcome which was arrived at with the best interests of the competition, our fellow clubs and ourselves as the sole motivating factor.”
