      <p><b>Smashing Pumpkins</b> frontman <b>William Patrick</b> (aka Billy) <b>Corgan</b> announced a new double album, <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/william-patrick-billy-corgan-releasing-new-double-lp-cotillions-this-month/">Cotillions</a></i>, due out later this month, and he just embarked on a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-corgan-announces-fall-solo-tour/">solo tour</a> supporting it. That tour kicked off on Monday night (11/4) for the first of three nights at LA’s Lodge Room, where, as <i><a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/11/billy-corgan-tour-kick-off-setlist-video/">Consequence of Sound</a></i> reports, Billy did two sets of new material, classic and deep cut Pumpkins tracks, a couple of Zwan songs, and couple of covers. The covers included “Little” Jimmy Dickens’ “Another Bridge to Burn,” and, in a particularly interesting choice, Sharon Van Etten’s “Every Time The Sun Comes Up,” from her 2014 album <i>Are We There</i>. Back in <a href="https://twitter.com/brynrich/status/1157639530847100929?s=20">August</a>, Billy posted an Instagram story about the SVE song, writing that he’d intended to play it during his <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/william-patrick-corgan-played-2-nights-murmrr-theatre-pics-video-setlists/">last solo tour</a> but that he’d “just never got to it.” We don’t have video of it (please share if you do) but hopefully that cover makes a reappearance at other shows this month.</p>
      <p>Among the new tracks that got their North American debut in LA are “Hard Times,” “Cri de Coeur,” and “Dancehall;” watch video of those, as well as a few Pumpkins tracks and Monday night’s setlist, below.</p>
      <p>Billy’s tour wraps up with three NYC shows, at Gramercy Theatre on November 18, 19, and 20. There are a few “Official Platinum” <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.com/billy-corgan-tickets/artist/1409040">tickets</a> left.</p>
