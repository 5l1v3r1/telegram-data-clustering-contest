習近平晤林鄭只談「信任」 港媒析弦外之音

05 Nov 2019, 17:55

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】中國國家主席習近平日前在上海會見了香港特首林鄭月娥。官媒報導習表態對林鄭「高度信任」，外界解讀為給林鄭及其團隊「打強心針」。有港媒援引時事評論人士觀點指出，習對林鄭的這番表態暗藏弦外之音，不代表北京會長期支持林鄭，將來需要「犧牲」時，林鄭仍隨時可被問責下台。
習近平11月4日晚在上海會見了正在上海出席第二屆中國國際進口博覽會的香港特首林鄭月娥。據中共官媒的報導，習在會見林鄭時表態說：香港「修例風波」已持續了5個月，「中央對你是高度信任的，對你和管治團隊的工作是充份肯定的」。習稱，香港當前最重要的任務仍然是「止暴制亂、恢復秩序」，他並要求林鄭繼續做好與各界的對話及改善民生的工作。
外界多認為，習近平這番話等於公開否定了有關中央打算讓林鄭下台的傳聞，同時也是在給疲於應付香港亂局的林鄭「打強心針」。
香港蘋果新聞網則引述時事評論員劉銳紹分析指出，習近平雖然表示對林鄭「高度信任」，卻沒有像過去那樣稱「堅定支持」，而北京當局當前強調的重點是「止暴制亂」，因此估計中共中央繼續讓林鄭留任，只不過是需要她繼續出面來落實中共的所謂「止暴制亂」的措施，解決香港眼前的危機。同時，北京當局也擔心香港政府的行政手段失控。為免執法部門再出亂子，習近平只好親自出面對林鄭當局表示支持，以此鞏固林鄭的管治，避免「大局」被擾亂。
劉銳紹強調，雖然中共中央礙於時勢暫時不DQ林鄭，但並不代表北京會長期支持林鄭，只要權力來源有需要犧牲時，林鄭仍會被問責下台。甚至為平息眾怒，香港警方的中下層人員亦有機會負上刑責。劉因此寄語香港的「執行者」們，「不要以為執行上方政策，就有尚方寶劍免責。」
其實，當年中共欲在香港強推23條立法失敗後，時任中共國務院總理溫家寶2005年3月6日接見當時的香港特首董建華時，也曾表態稱中共中央「充份肯定」董建華及其班子的工作，但4天後董並便對外宣布「腳痛」，已向中央遞交辭職呈辭。
此外，外界還注意到，這次陪同習近平會見林鄭的人，除了中共中央辦公廳主任丁薛祥、中央外事辦主任楊潔篪及外交部部長王毅外，還有盛傳已加入成為港澳工作協調小組副組長的公安部部長趙克志，中共官媒的相關報導都沒有提及港澳辦和中聯辦的主任。
英國《金融時報》今年10月曾引述知情人士稱，中國政府打算用「臨時」香港特首取代現任特首林正月娥，繼任者最晚在明年3月上任，接替林鄭完成剩餘任期，即到2022年。香港立法會議員田北辰也對彭博社稱，他得到的消息指北京考慮明年替換林鄭月娥，「大概二月或三月」。
對此，獨立評論人協會召集人、浸大新聞系高級講師呂秉權對港媒分析稱，中共暫時不會讓林鄭下台，是因為還需要林鄭「用儘剩餘日子，做 dirty job（幹髒活兒）」
英國BBC中文網則引述中國政治學者陳道銀分析指出，中共十九屆四中全會正式提出「中國之治」，正式挑戰西方制度，香港正處在中西之治爭鋒的前沿，解決香港問題將是一個長期過程。而中共目前處理香港問題有兩個底線，一是不讓香港問題蔓延、滲透到內地，二是避免西方激烈反應或制裁。在這樣的情況下，北京當局為了「避免動搖軍心」，也不太可能撤換林鄭月娥。
陳道銀推測，中共接下來可能採取蠶食手段，推出一些以往大陸很常見的治理手段來管控香港，例如加強對網絡言論的監管等。

Xi Jinping's meeting with Lin Zheng only talks about ""trust""

05 Nov 2019, 17:55

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai. The official media report is ""highly trusting"" for Lin Zheng, and the outside world interprets it as ""a strong shot"" for Lin Zheng and his team. Some Hong Kong media quoted current affairs commentators as saying that the fact that Xi’s statement on Lin Zheng’s appearance is not a sign that Beijing will support Lin Zheng for a long time. When Zheng Sai needs to be sacrificed, Lin Zheng can still be held accountable at any time.
On the evening of November 4th, Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue, who is attending the 2nd China International Import Expo in Shanghai. According to the report of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Zheng met with Lin Zhengshi and said: Hong Kong’s “remediation storm” has lasted for five months. “The central government is highly trusting to you and is fully sure of the work of you and the governance team. of"". According to Xi, the most important task in Hong Kong is still to ""stop the storm and restore order"". He also asked Lin Zheng to continue to do a good job in dialogue with all walks of life and improve people's livelihood.
The outside world believes that Xi Jinping’s remarks are equivalent to publicly denying the rumors that the central government intends to let Lin Zheng step down, and at the same time, he is also giving a strong heart to Lin Zheng, who is tired of dealing with the chaos in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's Apple News Network quoted current affairs commentator Liu Ruishao as saying that although Xi Jinping said that he ""highly trusts"" Lin Zheng, he did not call ""firm support"" as in the past, and the current emphasis of the Beijing authorities is ""stopping the storm."" Therefore, it is estimated that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will continue to let Lin Zheng stay in office. It is only that she needs to continue to come forward to implement the CCP's so-called ""anti-riot and chaos"" measures to resolve the crisis in front of Hong Kong. At the same time, the Beijing authorities are also worried that the administrative measures of the Hong Kong government will be out of control. In order to prevent the law enforcement agencies from making trouble again, Xi Jinping had to personally face the support of the Lin Zheng authorities to consolidate Lin Zheng’s governance and avoid the ""big picture"" being disrupted.
Liu Rushao emphasized that although the CPC Central Committee is temporarily not in DQ Lin Zheng due to the current situation, it does not mean that Beijing will support Lin Zheng for a long time. As long as the source of power needs to be sacrificed, Lin Zheng will still be held accountable for stepping down. Even in order to quell public anger, the middle and lower levels of the Hong Kong police also have the opportunity to bear criminal responsibility. Liu therefore sent a message to the ""executors"" of Hong Kong. ""Don't think that the implementation of the above policy will result in the exemption of the sword.""
In fact, when the CCP wanted to push 23 pieces of legislation in Hong Kong, when Premier Wen Jiabao of the Chinese Communist Party met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on March 6, 2005, he also said that the CPC Central Committee ""fully affirmed"" Tung Chee-hwa and his team. Work, but after 4 days, Dong Tung announced the ""foot pain"" and submitted a resignation to the Central Committee.
In addition, the outside world also noticed that the people who accompanied Xi Jinping to meet Lin Zheng, in addition to the director of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Ding Xuexiang, the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Office, Yang Jiechi, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi, there are also rumors that have joined the Hong Kong and Macao Working Coordination Group. Zhao Kezhi, the deputy head of the Ministry of Public Security, and the relevant reports of the Chinese Communist Party’s official media did not mention the directors of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the Liaison Office.
The British ""Financial Times"" quoted a person familiar with the matter in October this year, saying that the Chinese government intends to replace the current chief executive Lin Zhengyue with the ""temporary"" Hong Kong chief executive. The successor will take office at the latest in March next year, replacing Lin Zheng to complete the remaining term, that is, to 2022. year. Hong Kong Legislative Council member Tian Beichen also told Bloomberg that he had received information that Beijing would consider replacing Lin Zhengyue’s next year, ""probably February or March.""
In this regard, Lv Bingquan, the convener of the Independent Critics Association and senior lecturer of the Baptist Department of Journalism, said to the Hong Kong media that the CCP will not let Lin Zheng step down because it is still necessary to use the remaining days to do dirty jobs. Work)
The British BBC Chinese network quoted Chinese political scholar Chen Daoyin as saying that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee officially proposed the ""rule of China"" and formally challenged the Western system. Hong Kong is at the forefront of the dispute between China and the West. Solving the Hong Kong problem will be a Long-term process. The CCP's current handling of the Hong Kong issue has two bottom lines. One is to prevent the spread of the Hong Kong issue and penetrate the Mainland. The second is to avoid fierce Western reaction or sanctions. Under such circumstances, the Beijing authorities are unlikely to remove Lin Zhengyue in order to ""avoid the turmoil of the military.""
Chen Dao-Yin speculated that the CCP might adopt a means of encroaching and introduce some of the most common governance methods in the past to control Hong Kong, such as strengthening supervision over online speech.
