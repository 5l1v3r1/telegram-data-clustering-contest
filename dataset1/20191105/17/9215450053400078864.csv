Written by: Smart ED Editorial Department | Photo: Unsplash, New Media Reference Room, Twitter McDonald's issued a statement on the incident, saying that Eastbrook violated the CEO's rule not to fall in love with employees. The board decided to fire him after voting last Friday. And was replaced by Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald's in the United States. Eastbrook also sent an email to employees acknowledging the incident, saying that considering the company's values and agreeing with the board's decision, it is time to leave.

He served as president of European McDonald's, CEO of McDonald's, and global brand director. He took over as CEO in 2015. During his reign, he launched a number of innovation policies, including mobile application ordering services. Online payment, cooperation with UberEats and other merchants, the launch of a full-day breakfast and the elimination of poorly-sold products have successfully attracted many new customers, sales have increased significantly, and the company's share price has nearly doubled, which is considered to be the hero of reforming the brand.
