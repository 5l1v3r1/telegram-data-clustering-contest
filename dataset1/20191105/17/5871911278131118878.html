      <h1>NBA suspends Hawks' John Collins 25 games for PEDs</h1>

      <p>One of Atlanta’s promising young players will be out for a while due to suspension.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nba.com/article/2019/11/05/john-collins-hawks-25-game-suspension">NBA announced on Tuesday</a> that third-year forward John Collins has been suspended 25 games for violating the league’s Anti-Drug policy. Collins tested positive for Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-2 (GHRP-2).</p>
      <p>The former 19th overall pick is coming off a season in which he averaged 19.5 points and 9.8 rebounds in just his second year in the league. Through five games this season, he was the Hawks’ second-leading scorer (17.0) behind Trae Young and their top rebounder (8.8).</p>
      <p>Collins said in a statement that he plans to fight his suspension.</p>

      <p>This is a huge blow to the Hawks and Collins’ development heading into a pivotal third year. Not only that, but the suspension will cost Collins $610,582, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyMarks42/status/1191740797001125891">ESPN’s Bobby Marks</a>. This is the third instance of a player violating the Anti-Drug policy this year. Brooklyn’s Wilson Chandler and Phoenix’s Deandre Ayton were the other two.</p>
