During the early morning operation, a number of other suspects escaped arrest and are still at large.

The arrests were confirmed by Kisii Central Sub County Police Commander Zachary Kimani and area DCI Martin Korongo who led the operation.
It has now emerged that the school doesn’t have a laboratory and candidates will be forced to sit for practicals from their classrooms.
The developments come a day after Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha warned parents and students against exam cheating.
