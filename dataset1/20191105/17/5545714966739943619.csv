Watch this Nioh 2 beta player crush all the bosses with Level 1 gear
Yatsu-no-Kami is no joke
05 Nov 2019, 17:15 by Jordan Devore
My weekend with the Nioh 2 beta did not go as smoothly as I hoped it would, but I'm not giving up yet – it's not over until November 10. I don't know if I'll ""get good"" in time, but I'll settle for adequacy.
If you're struggling to survive against that dang weasel, or the no-good snake, or any of the other monstrous threats staring you down in Nioh 2, I feel you. Here's enough inspiration for both of us: a complete beta boss rush cleared with Level 1 character stats and gear. No armor, no magic, no problem.



""Some sloppy runs, but eh, I'm still getting used to the new stuff,"" said player Poto2222.
If anyone has a Hyperbolic Time Chamber they'd be willing to rent out, hit me up. Otherwise, I'll practice the hard way (and then try to use a bunch of cheap talismans to bring these bosses down).
For many of us, this beta is a firm reminder that we're not as good at Nioh as we thought we were.
