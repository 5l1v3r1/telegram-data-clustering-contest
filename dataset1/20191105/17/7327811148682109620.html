      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- As cold air ushers into the New York area early Friday, some places could see snowflakes as a coastal storm departs.</p>
      <p>Thursday will be a fairly wet day as a cold front passes through and a low moves up along the coast.</p>
      <p>That means rain across the area to start, but as that system is departing, a high pressure system to the west will begin pushing the coldest air of the season into the region,</p>
      <p>As the cold air arrives, a mix of precipitation and some snow in the Poconos and Catskills can be expected on the back end.</p>
      <p>Some northern communities could also see some flurries.</p>
      <p>Behind the system, we will have the coldest weekend of the season with high temperatures not breaking the 40 degree mark in some places.</p>
