      <h1>The Witcher on Netflix 'leans more towards horror' than fantasy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:25:52+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>The Witcher <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-witcher-3-mods/">videogames</a> are fantasy RPGs, based on fantasy novels and short stories written by Andrzej Sapkowski. But <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-witcher-series/">The Witcher</a> series on Netflix "leans more towards horror," visual effects supervisor Julian Parry told SFX magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-netflix-series-fantasy-horror-interview/">GamesRadar</a>), because the world of The Witcher is actually pretty horrific—and also because it's easier to manage.</p>
      <p>"I definitely think it leans more towards horror. We’re definitely taking the fantasy out. I can honestly say we’re not fantastical. I mean, it’s fantastical but in a grounded horror sense," Parry said. "For example, with Striga [a woman cursed to live as a monster], that’s one gnarly-looking thing. That’s very unpleasant!"</p>
      <p>Courtesy of <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Striga">The Witcher Wiki</a>, this is what a Striga looks like, and it's fair to say that she wouldn't be out of place in your average D-list slasher flick:</p>

      <p>Logistics are a factor, too. "We’ve got the Nilfgaard armies, which can’t exist because there are 10,000-plus of them," Parry said. "Same with the Temerians and the Cintrans. the armies physically can’t exist here on set."</p>
      <p>Anyone who's watched Game of Thrones can tell you that CGI goes a long way toward filling that hole, and it's not as though huge armies won't make any sort of appearance in the series—we catch a brief glimpse of a large-scale clash between armies in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-witcher-trailer-breakdown/">The Witcher trailer</a>, after all. But The Witcher is a very personal story—when you get right down to it, Geralt is just a guy trying to make a living in a gig economy—and that's where elements of horror can really shine, even in a clearly fantastical setting.</p>
      <p>I'm eager to see how it works out, but "taking the fantasy out" notwithstanding, I'm reasonably confident that The Witcher on Netflix will still be a fantasy tale: A Striga may be horrifying, but it's going to take a sword and some magic to deal with it, after all.</p>
      <p>The Witcher will debut on Netflix on December 20. A second season hasn't been signed yet, but showrunner Lauren Hissrich is ready for it: She recently said that she's already got <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-witcher-showrunner-already-has-seven-seasons-mapped-out/">seven seasons mapped out</a>.</p>
