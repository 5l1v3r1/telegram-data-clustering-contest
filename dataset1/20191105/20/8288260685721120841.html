      <h1>'Tremendous' - The Aston Villa story still giving Everton fans nightmares</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa 6 Everton 2 | "It was one of those games where Villa looked like scoring at every attack"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:20:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mat Kendrick, https://www.facebook.com/matkendrickjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Remember, remember the FIFTH of November.</p>
      <p>But on this day 30 years ago, Villa Park was experiencing the joy of SIX as Graham Taylor's men beat Everton 6-2.</p>
      <p>Braces from Ian Olney and David Platt were sandwiched between goals from Gordon Cowans and Kent Nielsen during the televised rout to give the claret and blue faithful a warm bonfire night glow.</p>
      <p>Reporting on the Sunday afternoon drubbing for the Birmingham Post, Robert Millward wrote: "<a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> produced their own box of fireworks to set Villa Park alight with thoughts of another League championship."</p>
      <p>The emphatic victory was Villa's fifth win on the trot and lifted them up to third as they prevented title challengers Everton from regaining the top spot.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Villa would finish runners up to the Toffees' Merseyside rivals Liverpool in the race for the Championship.</p>

      <p>"It was one of those games where Villa looked like scoring at every attack," reported Millward in the Post, as Taylor's claret and blues raced into a 6-0 lead in just over an hour.</p>
      <p>Cowans got the ball rolling after just five minutes by drilling a low right-foot angled drive into bottom left corner from just inside the area following a pass from Chris Price.</p>
      <p>Olney tapped in the second on 19 minutes after Platt's close range effort from a measured Ian Ormondroyd cross from the left was saved by Everton and Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall.</p>
      <p>Platt got on the scoresheet himself on 25 minutes with a glancing header past Southall from a precise Cowans free-kick after Norman Whiteside fouled Ormondroyd.</p>
      <p>He completed his brace from the first attack of the second half on 49 minutes, making it four by stepping past his marker and slotting in a low shot after receiving a pass from Kevin Gage.</p>
      <p>Soon it was 5-0 as Ormondroyd's raid down the left saw the lanky striker's shot saved by Southall before Olney nodded in the rebound as Platt challenged for the ball on 52 minutes.</p>
      <p>Nielsen added the sixth on 67 minutes by getting the faintest of touches at the back post in front of a jubilant Holte End after Cowans floated over another accurate free-kick.</p>
      <p>Everton pulled two back late on through Tony Cottee on 83 minutes and a Paul McGrath own goal on 85 minutes, much to the annoyance of goalkeeper Nigel Spink who was angry to see the defence breached even with such a comfortable winning margin.</p>
      <p>It failed to dent the excitement of the fans, however, who burst onto the field in a good-natured pitch invasion at the final whistle.</p>
      <p>"We played extremely well and our finishing was first class," said Taylor, singling out Cowans and Ormondroyd for special praise.</p>
      <p>"It will do our confidence a tremendous amount of good."</p>
      <p>Taylor's Toffees counterpart Colin Harvey was less impressed by his own side's performance, saying: "I would say it is one of my worst days in football."</p>
