      <p>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- Four-year-old London'Marie Redick-Walker can spell her name in Spanish and American Sign Language.<br/><br/>London'Marie along with about thirty other elementary students attend From the Heart Preschool. It is the only S.T.E.A.M. preschool in Inglewood and this year, it celebrates its twentieth anniversary.<br/><br/>"S.T.E.A.M. is science, technology, engineering, arts, math and our curriculum is a mixture of all those things," Betty Bradley Luckett founder of From the Heart said.<br/><br/>Ms. Betty didn't start in education. Before opening From the Heart, she was an engineer for the city of Los Angeles and she said she saw a need for early exposure to kids in her community.<br/><br/>"Being an engineer for the city of LA, there weren't many of us there," Luckett said. "So, I want our youth to be exposed to that type of curriculum so that they're able to have those opportunities, so we can see more people of color."<br/><br/>Head teacher Cherie Heinrich said they use hands-on, open-ended activities to teach lessons and relate to real-world situations.<br/><br/>"The world is changing, the community is changing and hopefully the problems in our community, they can learn to solve them," Heinrich said.<br/><br/>Not only do they offer the standard S.T.E.A.M. curriculum at From the Heart, but they also offer what might be considered after-school programs at other places, like tennis, yoga, karate and music lessons.<br/><br/>Brandi Redick said she struggled and felt like she was behind when she got to higher education, which is why she chose this school for her daughter.<br/><br/>"I wanted to make sure my daughter didn't have that feeling of being in a race," Brandi said. "Which is why I chose From the Heart Preschool."<br/><br/><b>Follow Ashley on social media:<br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/abc7AshleyM/">Facebook.com/abc7ashleym</a><br/><a href="https://twitter.com/abc7ashleym">Twitter.com/abc7ashleym</a><br/><a href="https://www.instagram.com/abc7ashleym/">Instagram.com/abc7ashleym</a></b></p>
