      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Voters in Boston are weighing whether to rename the square in a historically black neighborhood to Nubian Square.</p>
      <p>The non-binding resolution on Tuesday's ballot would change the name of Dudley Square in Roxbury.</p>
      <p>Supporters argue the commercial center should be renamed because Roxbury resident Thomas Dudley was a leading politician when Massachusetts became the first colony to legally sanction slavery in 1641.</p>
      <p>Slavery was effectively abolished in Massachusetts in the 1780s.</p>
      <p>Opponents counter that slavery was also part of the ancient Nubian empire, located in modern-day Egypt and Sudan.</p>
      <p>Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh hasn't taken a position on the proposal but says he's prepared to advance regulations for the change if approved.</p>
      <p>Roxbury is where a young Martin Luther King, Jr. preached and Malcolm X grew up.</p>
