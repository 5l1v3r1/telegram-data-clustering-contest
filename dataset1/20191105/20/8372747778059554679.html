      <p>Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear is the projected winner in a contentious gubernatorial race, overtaking the incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in a state President Donald Trump won by nearly 30 points in 2016.</p>
      <p>Beshear unofficially won by 4,000 votes.</p>
      <p>The projection was made by Scripps' Lexington station WLEX-TV.</p>
      <p>This comes despite Trump's popularity in the state, and Trump making a stop in Kentucky on Monday, appearing alongside Bevin.</p>
      <p>A Mason-Dixon poll showed that 65 of Kentucky voters oppose an impeachment of Trump. The same poll also showed that 57 percent of Kentuckians approve of Trump’s job performance.</p>
      <p>Nationally, most polls show Trump with an above 50 percent disapproval rating, and nearly 50 percent of U.S. voters supportive of Trump’s impeachment.</p>
      <p>But polls showed the race between Bevin and Beshear would be neck and neck, and those polls appear to be accurate.</p>
      <p>A Mason-Dixon poll of 625 Kentucky voters in October showed a 46-46 tie between the two candidates.</p>
      <p>The relationship between Bevin and Beshear has been contentious, as Beshear has sued the Bevin administration, most recently in the spring over Bevin’s office issuing subpoenas during a statewide teacher sick-out.</p>
      <p>The Bevin administration vowed to hold teachers responsible during the sick-outs, which drew Beshear’s objections.</p>
