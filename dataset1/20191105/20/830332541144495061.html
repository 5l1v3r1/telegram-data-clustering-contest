      <p>LAS VEGAS - An ex-felon has pleaded not guilty to killing a 24-year-old adult entertainment model and encasing her body in a concrete structure found in the desert outside Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Christopher Santo Prestipino's attorney, William Terry, didn't immediately respond Tuesday to messages following their appearance in Nevada state court.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old Prestipino has been indicted on murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges in the death of Esmeralda Gonzalez.</p>
      <p>Prestipino and his 39-year-old roommate, Casandra Garrett, are accused of poisoning and strangling Gonzalez in May.</p>
      <p>Gonzalez's body was found in October near the Interstate 15 community of Glendale.</p>
      <p>Garrett was arrested last month in Wisconsin, where she is jailed in Milwaukee pending her extradition to Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Prestipino's 31-year-old girlfriend, Lisa Mort, is due in court next month on an aiding a felon charge.</p>
