      <h1>Unemployment to fall below 5% but economist warns more needs to be done</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:57:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/geoff-percival/" target="_blank">By Geoff Percival</a></address>
      <p>The national unemployment rate is still on course to fall below 5% next year, assuming a hard Brexit is avoided, but numerous issues need to be addressed in the labour market for it to truly thrive, one economist has warned.</p>
      <p>Latest CSO figures show unemployment fell to 4.8% in October, down from 4.9% in September, and from 5.7% in October of last year.</p>
      <p>“While on the surface the Irish labour market looks healthy, there are a lot of faults that need to be mended,” said independent economist Alan McQuaid.</p>
      <p>The CSO figures show a marginal increase — to 12.3% — in the youth unemployment rate last month.</p>
      <p>“There is clearly a problem about the number of jobs available for school leavers and new graduates from college, and the appalling treatment of these students by potential employers.</p>
      <blockquote>“There should be more encouragement, in second-level, for students to take apprenticeships and away from the overcrowded university system,” said Mr McQuaid.</blockquote>
      <p>He also pointed to unequal pay for female workers and the issue of the mental wellbeing of employees as areas of the labour market that need more attention.</p>
      <p>Chambers Ireland welcomed the headline CSO data, but has urged better use of the National Training Fund to focus on in-work training to help companies address emerging skills gaps.</p>
      <p>“As we approach full employment we must be mindful of the challenges of such a tight labour market. It’s increasingly challenging for many businesses to find and retain talent leading to increased skills gaps and higher labour costs,” said Chambers CEO Ian Talbot.</p>
