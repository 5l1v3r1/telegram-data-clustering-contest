      <p><i>The End of the F**king World</i> is a bleak series filled with blood and depravity, but you wouldn't know that from its <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-end-of-the-fing-world-soundtrack-sets-a-surprisingly-bright-tone-for-a-super-creepy-series-7951283">Season 2 soundtrack</a>. The <a href="https://www.tunefind.com/show/the-end-of-the-f-king-world/season-2">songs throughout <i>End of the F**king World </i></a>are an eclectic and often upbeat mix ranging from 2000s indie rock to '50s doo-wop and '70s folk music. So, basically the opposite of what you'd expect to hear in a show largely centered around death.</p>
      <p>Most of Season 2's music was composed by Blur's Graham Coxon, who also scored the first season. According to the Line of Best Fit, the official <a href="https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/graham-coxon-drops-she-knows-from-the-end-of-the-fing-world-2nd-series">soundtrack will be released on Nov. 8</a> and will include tracks such as the suspenseful "She Knows," the dread-inducing "Meaner Than The Sea," and the catchy folk diddy "Mash Potato."</p>
      <p>When the show isn't playing Coxon's score, though, it's usually featuring songs pretty incongruous to the events unfolding onscreen. Here's an episode-by-episode breakdown.</p>
