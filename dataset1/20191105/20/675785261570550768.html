      <h1>Granit Xhaka facing January sale as Unai Emery snubs his hopes of Arsenal recall</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal could look to sell Granit Xhaka in the January transfer window after his outburst at fans saw him stripped of the captaincy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:11:42+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal could look to offload Granit Xhaka in January after manager Unai Emery refused to say if he will ever play for the club again.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has been stripped of the captaincy by Emery and replaced by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after his outburst at fans following his substitution against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>The Swiss international has not featured since that incident on October 27 and has not travelled to Portugal for their clash with Vitoria in the Europa League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It is understood Xhaka had hoped for a recall but Emery has snubbed the midfielder and opted to draw a line under the issue.</p>
      <p>His response has led to serious questions over his future at the club - fuelled further when Emery refused to confirm if he will play for the club again as they consider offloading him in January.</p>

      <p>Asked if Xhaka will play for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> again, Emery said: "The future is Arsenal’s future. We have a very important match on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We need to take some decisions... My focus is for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“He is our player, we want to respect him."</p>

      <p>Pressed further on whether the decision is permanent, he was tight-lipped on Xhaka's future at the club, stating: "We’re speaking a lot about that. It’s clear. There’s no more words about that.</p>
      <p>“I told him and told the other captains. Then the time is giving us the next weeks and months, how we can continue with every player.”</p>

      <p>Aubameyang, already part of the leadership group established by a dressing room vote which initially handed Xhaka the armband, has taken over the captaincy.</p>
      <p>But the Gabonese striker is not part of the squad in Guimaraes, with Hector Bellerin expected to lead the side in his absence.</p>
