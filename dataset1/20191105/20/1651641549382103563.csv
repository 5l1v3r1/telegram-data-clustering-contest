Celebrate 10 years of Just Dance by helping raise money for Alzheimer’s Research UK
05 Nov 2019, 20:04 by Ash

Just Dance 2020 launches today and in celebration of 10 years of the Just Dance series, Ubisoft is helping raise money for Alzheimer’s Research UK.

If you want to help out the charity, all you need to do is simply Retweet the Tweet below, comment on the Instagram post below, or share the Facebook post found in the following link. You don’t need to be in the UK to help out – you just need a public Twitter, Instagram, or valid Facebook account.
For every share and comment gained, Ubisoft will donate £1 to charity, up to a total of £30,000.






You can also make your own Tweet or reply to a Tweet using the hashtag #JustDanceMemories in order to donate another £1. You can do this as many times as you like, as long as you have a public Twitter account and use the aforementioned hashtag. Retweeting of Tweets that include the hashtag also counts!
The posts also include a video that focuses on Lynne Wadsworth and her mother, Anne. Anne is sadly in the late stages of dementia and is no longer able to communicate, but she and Lynne attend a dance class each week that brings a sparkle back to Anne’s eyes.
These kinds of memories are precious, and Just Dance and Alzheimer’s Research UK want to help preserve them. Alzheimer’s Research UK is the UK’s leading dementia research charity, dedicated to causes, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and cure.
It funds a broad range of research projects to understand dementia and drive the UK towards better diagnosis, prevention, and treatments. The charity hopes to have the first life-changing dementia treatment available by 2025.
For full terms and conditions regarding the contest, you can follow the link here.



The latest instalment in the series, Just Dance 2020, releases today on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and, fascinatingly enough, the Nintendo Wii.
In fact, Just Dance 2020 is officially the last game that will ever be released on the Wii. It’s an appropriate celebration and a jubilant send-off for one of Nintendo’s most popular home consoles.
Just Dance 2020 will also be coming to the Google Stadia upon the Stadia’s release.
