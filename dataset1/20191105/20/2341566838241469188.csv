（中央社記者邱國強北京5日電）中共今晚公布19屆四中全會決定全文提到，要完善中央對港澳特首和主要官員任免機制、全國人大常委會對基本法的解釋制度，依法行使中國憲法和基本法「賦予中央的各項權力」。
至於涉台內容，除全會公報提到的「堅定推進祖國和平統一進程」外，還聲稱要推動兩岸「就和平發展達成制度性安排」，並重彈「和平統一後，台灣同胞的社會制度和生活方式將得到充分尊重，台灣同胞的私人財產、宗教信仰、合法權益將得到充分保障」的舊調。
中共19屆四中全會在10月28至31日在北京舉行，會中通過「中共中央關於堅持和完善中國特色社會主義制度，推進國家治理體系和治理能力現代化若干重大問題的決定」，今晚由新華社公布全文，內含15大項，均以「堅持和完善」為名，且較會後公報多出不少深入性的闡述。
其中，第12項「堅持和完善『一國兩制』制度體系，推進祖國和平統一」為涉港澳及涉台政策，提及上述內容。
條文重申，必須堅持「一國是實行兩制的前提和基礎，兩制從屬和派生於一國，並統一於一國之內。嚴格依照憲法和基本法對香港特別行政區、澳門特別行政區實行管治」。要全面準確貫徹「一國兩制、港人治港、澳人治澳、高度自治」方針。
同時要堅持「依法治港治澳，維護憲法和基本法確定的憲制秩序，把堅持一國原則和尊重兩制差異、維護中央對特別行政區全面管治權和保障特別行政區高度自治權」結合起來。完善特區與憲法、基本法實施相關的制度和機制，堅持「以愛國者為主體」的港人治港、澳人治澳」。
這項條文說，要健全中央依照憲法和基本法對特區「行使全面管治權的制度」。完善中央對特區行政長官和主要官員的任免制度和機制、全國人大常委會對基本法的解釋制度，依法行使憲法和基本法賦予中央的各項權力。
同時建立健全特區「維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，支持特別行政區強化執法力量」。健全特區行政長官「對中央政府負責的制度」，支持行政長官和特區政府「依法施政」。
條文又說，要推進「粵港澳大灣區」建設，支持港澳「著力解決影響社會穩定和長遠發展的深層次矛盾和問題」。加強對港澳社會、特別是公職人員和青少年的「憲法和基本法教育、國情教育、中國歷史和中華文化教育」，增強港澳民眾「國家意識和愛國精神」。
同時要「堅決防範和遏制外部勢力干預港澳事務和進行分裂、顛覆、滲透、破壞活動，確保香港、澳門長治久安」。
至於涉台部份，條文以「堅定推進祖國和平統一進程」指出，推動兩岸「就和平發展達成制度性安排」。「完善促進兩岸交流合作、深化兩岸融合發展、保障台灣同胞福祉的制度安排和政策措施，團結廣大台灣同胞共同反對台獨、促進統一」。
條文聲稱，「在確保國家主權、安全、發展利益的前提下，和平統一後，台灣同胞的社會制度和生活方式將得到充分尊重，台灣同胞的私人財產、宗教信仰、合法權益將得到充分保障」。（編輯：周慧盈）1081105
