      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a> owner, Dean Spanos, has denied reports his team are open to moving the NFL franchise to London.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1347540/2019/11/04/with-london-ready-for-an-nfl-team-the-chargers-have-been-discussed-as-a-possible-option/">According to a report in the Athletic</a>, the team would listen to the NFL if the league approached them to discuss a relocation to the UK, where they would play their home games at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Spanos strongly denied the reports. “It’s total fucking bullshit,” <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_d_williams/status/1191794366844522496">he told reporters</a>. “We’re not going to London. We’re not going anywhere. We’re playing in Los Angeles. This is our home, and this is where we are planning to be for a long fucking time. Period.”</p>
      <p>The Chargers currently play at Dignity Health Sports Park, the home of Major League Soccer’s LA Galaxy. They have struggled to draw significant crowds <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/12/san-diego-chargers-to-move-to-los-angeles-report">since relocating from San Diego in 2017</a>, and away fans <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chargers-attendance-in-la-low-2017-8">often dominate the stands</a> at their home games. The Chargers plan to move into a new $4.5bn stadium that they will share with the city’s other NFL team, the Rams, in 2020.</p>
      <p>Rumors of an NFL franchise in London <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/12/nfl-london-2018-franchise-move-wembley">have swirled</a> ever since the league started playing regular fixtures in the UK in 2007. There are currently three NFL games in London a year, and another team with disappointing home support – the Jacksonville Jaguars – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/04/how-close-are-we-to-a-london-jaguars-nfl-franchise">have been linked with a move across the Atlantic</a>.</p>
