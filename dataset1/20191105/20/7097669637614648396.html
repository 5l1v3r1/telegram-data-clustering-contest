      <h1>Louis Eppolito: 'Mafia cop' who murdered people for infamous crime family dies in prison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:22:37+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Vittoria Elliott</a></address>
      <p>So-called “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mafia">mafia</a> cop” <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/louis-eppolito">Louis Eppolito</a>, who was convicted of murdering several people for the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lucchese">Lucchese</a> crime family and who appeared in the mob movie <i>Goodfellas</i>, has died in federal prison while serving a life sentence. He was 71 years old.</p>
      <p>Eppolito was convicted of helping to orchestrate eight mob killings roughly between 1986-1990 along with his partner Stephen Caracappa.</p>
      <p>Eppolito and Caracappa also passed on information about ongoing police investigations into the mafia, including the names of informants, while working as police officers for the NYPD.</p>
      <p>The Lucchese crime organisation was one of the so-called “Five Families” that dominated crime in New York City for decades.</p>
      <p>In some cases, the murders were perpetrated based on information from Eppolito and Caracappa.</p>
      <p>One the victims did not have connections to organised crime but was unfortunate enough to share a name with a member of the rival Gambino crime family. <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/01/30/city-to-pay-5-million-to-family-of-man-killed-in-mob-hit-facilitated-by-crooked-cops/">Nicholas Guido</a> was 26 when he was shot outside his mother’s house in a hit ordered by the Lucchese family on information passed on by Eppolito and his partner.</p>
      <p>Guido’s family won a $5 million lawsuit against New York City for his death.</p>
      <p>In other cases Eppolito and Caracappa acted as hitmen themselves. The pair killed a diamond dealer named <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Mafia-Cops-Wrongful-Death-Lawsuit-5-Million-Settlement-NYPD-Louis-Eppolito-Stephen-Caracappa-320186821.html">Israel Greenwald</a> after using the NYPD police database to find his licence plate number and tail him.</p>
      <p>Mr Greenwald’s remains were excavated from beneath a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/nyregion/police-dig-for-mans-body-in-brooklyn.html?searchResultPosition=4">Brooklyn warehouse</a> in 2005.</p>
      <p>Somewhat ironically, during the same time that Eppolito was working with the Lucchese family, he had a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258388/">bit part</a> in the movie <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/goodfellas">Goodfellas</a> as Fat Andy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/mafia-cop-louis-eppolito-dies-in-prison-while-serving-life-for-mob-hits/"><i>New York Post</i> reports</a> that Eppolito had had health problems for some time.</p>
      <p>Eppolito and Caracappa were convicted of racketeering, kidnapping, and murder, among other charges. Caracappa died of cancer in a federal prison in North Carolina in 2017.</p>
