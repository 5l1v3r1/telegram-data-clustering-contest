Kim Kardashian, a mother of four, is prepared to tone down her sexy outfits in the near future.

“He is my husband so I obviously want to honor him and what he’s feeling and he’s been going through this life change,” said Kardashian. “It’s mostly about the kids. The kids are getting older and he’s very conscious about what we have in the house. We got rid of TVs in the kids’ rooms and removed makeup from North’s room.”
According to Kardashian, Kanye's religious journey has led him to become ""a little more strict"" as a father, leading to his criticism of certain ""imagery"" in his household.

""But I also think there's the fine line of staying firm and doing what you feel comfortable with. I take a little bit of him and I respect what he's saying and I totally compromise.""
