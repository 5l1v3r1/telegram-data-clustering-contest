The challenge of rescuing Iran's nuclear deal is increasing - EU
05 Nov 2019, 20:04 by Nura Ado Suleiman

The European Union (EU) has raised concerns over Iran's announcement on Tuesday that it plans to continue the refining and upgrading of uranium energy at a base in the south of the country, which could allow it to acquire nuclear weapons.

Shortly after the announcement by Iran, EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic expressed concern over the increased challenges she had to save from a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, which the US dropped out of last year.
Following the withdrawal from the nuclear deal, US President Donald Trump reiterated Iran's series of economic sanctions which had been withdrawn by former President Barack Obama, and rescinded parts of the nuclear deal. and the major English countries.
Since the US withdrawal from the French, German, British and Eu coalition efforts to rescue it, Iran is still unhappy with their efforts, considering its failure to implement a plan for a European company. to maintain contact with Iran despite US sanctions.
EU foreign ministers are expected to meet in Brussels early next week to discuss Iran's nuclear issue and other Middle East issues.
