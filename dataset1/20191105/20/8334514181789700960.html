      <p>CAIRO (Reuters) - Kuwait’s deputy foreign minister Khaled al-Jarallah said on Tuesday that Kuwait conveyed messages from Iran to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain regarding the situation in the Gulf region, and “until now no answers have emerged”.</p>
      <p>The Iranian Foreign Ministry had said last month that Iran is prepared to hold talks with regional rival Saudi Arabia, “with or without the help of a mediator”.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, which is locked in several proxy wars in the region with Iran, has blamed Tehran for attacks on Saudi oil plants on Sept. 14, a charge Iran denies. The kingdom has said it prefers a political solution to a military one.</p>
