      <p>The 27-year-old Switzerland international has been left out of the squad for the match.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for the club since he told fans to “f*** off” when he was booed following his substitution against Crystal Palace on October 27th.</p>
      <p>He revealed death threats against his wife and messages wishing his daughter got cancer pushed him to “boiling point” and that is why he lashed out at fans.</p>
      <p>“My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have hurt me<br/>deeply,” he wrote in an Instagram post four days after the incident.</p>
      <p>“People have said things like ‘We will break your legs’, ‘Kill your wife’ and<br/>‘Wish that your daughter gets cancer’.</p>
      <p>“That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection<br/>in the stadium on Sunday.”</p>
