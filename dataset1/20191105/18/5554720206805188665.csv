Did growing outrage force Bigg Boss to change its mind on Siddharth Shukla’s eviction? Tehseen Poonawalla remains ‘absent’ from show
05 Nov 2019, 18:18 by JKR Staff
Colors TV’s popular reality TV show Bigg Boss on Tuesday deferred the broadcast of the episode, in which its Monday night promo had predicted about the shock announcement on Siddharth Shukla’s eviction. Tuesday night’s promo also carried the controversial fight between Siddharth and Mahira Sharma, but it shockingly dropped the reference to ghar se beghar (eviction) from the warning issued by Bigg Boss. This is largely seen as the makers of the show having a second thought on evicting Siddharth, who is arguably the most popular contestant in the house.



The promo on Siddharth’s reported eviction had evoked angry reactions from Twitterati with many of whom even threatening to stop watching the show without Siddharth.













On Tuesday night, Mahira was seen constantly provoking Siddharth during the show. One could see her testing Siddharth’s patience. At one point she was seen showing her shoe to Siddharth. All hell broke loose during the second round of the weekly task when Siddharth and Mahira fought with each other to gain control over a packet. Outpowered by Siddharth, Mahira fell down on the floor.
Asim Riaz had an ugly spat with Arhaan Khan after the latter took offence to his ‘washroom’ comments aimed at Shehnaaz Gill. Asim had asked Shehnaaz if she had made an adequate number of chapattis. To which, Shehnaaz said that chapattis were getting wasted.
Soon Arhaan got involved and began to fight with Asim on behalf of Shehnaaz. Siddharth defended Asim as both began to poke fun at Arhaan’s physical appearance.
Hindustani Bhau briefly threatened Paras Chhabra of consequences after he told his rivals to not behave like women. This irked some woman contestants and Bhau that his comments were misogynistic and he must be careful in future adding that this will not be tolerated.
Tuesday night also saw Shehnaaz desert her friends namely Asim and Siddharth and join the group led by Paras Chhabra.
Another highlight of Tuesday’s episode was Tehseen Poonawalla’s lack of presence in the show. Prior to joining the show, he had told Salman Khan that he will outsmart Siddharth Shukla and eventually win the competition. However, Tuesday was the third episode in a row when he failed to impress his fans by remaining a mute spectator in the game.
