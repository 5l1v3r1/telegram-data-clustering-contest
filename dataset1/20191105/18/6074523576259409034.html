      <h1>Libra Won’t Spread as Quickly as Facebook, Says Calibra Exec</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:15:51+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">William Foxley</a></address>
      <p>Libra will take years – if not decades –  to catch on says a Calibra executive.</p>
      <p>The new stablecoin project won’t scale like social media, said Kevin Weil, vice president of product at Facebook subsidiary Calibra at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal on Tuesday. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/facebook-calibra-vp-product-kevin-weil-discusses-libra-at-web-summit.html">CNBC </a>reported on his talk.</p>
      <p>“This is not going to be a thing that spreads like a social network. This is going to be the work not of years but of decades, and it’s worth making,” Weil said.</p>
      <p>The Calibra VP further claimed the Libra Association and its members remain determined regardless of the recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ebay-stripe-follow-paypal-in-quitting-facebooks-libra-project">high profile departures</a>, including MasterCard and Visa. The 21 initial members <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-led-libra-forms-governing-council-after-big-name-departures">signed a formal</a> charter last month in Geneva, Switzerland. Weil said that Libra was just an idea 18 months ago, but now has 21 members and a “bunch more that are looking to be involved.”</p>
      <p>Weil told Web Summit attendees that users will have more wallets than just Calibra, the Libra-specific wallet Facebook is creating, to choose from. Fears of Facebook using Calibra for discriminatory or otherwise unsavory purposes were <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/zuckerberg-facebook-would-quit-libra-if-association-launched-prematurely">recently raised by U.S. lawmakers</a> at a congressional hearing on Libra joined by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg.</p>
      <p>Weil reiterated Zuckerberg’s hearing statements, saying other wallet options will be available that can still leverage “the accessibility and lower cost brought by the libra ecosystem.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, private wallets are already available. Israeli developer <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/zengo-introduces-non-custodial-keyless-competitor-to-calibra-wallet">ZenGo released</a> a keyless non-custodial Libra-compatible wallet only two weeks after Facebook announced the stablecoin project in June.</p>
