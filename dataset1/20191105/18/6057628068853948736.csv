Mystery rebels kill 13 students in River
05 Nov 2019, 18:43 by Nura Ado Suleiman, Abdoulkarim Ibrahim

At least 13 people have been killed by suspected insurgents from Kogi State in central Nigeria, on Friday between November 1 and 4.

The attackers attacked students in Ayingba, targeting students studying at the university.
It was initially revealed that two students had been killed, a situation that had harbored other secrecy groups, who had planned to retaliate against the 13 suspects.
Among those killed in the clashes were the leader of the secretariat of Kogi State College of Science and Technology in Lokoja, and the murder of secret agents of the University of Ayingba.
Eyewitnesses say the incident spread from the university to Stadium Road and to a center known as Our Lady Fatima Lodge, where many were killed and their bodies removed.
Kogi State Commissioner of Police CP Hakeem Busari confirmed the incident, but said that three students had been killed in exchange for 13 people, while he said they were hunting those involved.
