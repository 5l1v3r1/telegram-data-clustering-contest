內地製造業PMI遜預期！11月A股還看「十四五」｜羅尚沛
05 Nov 2019, 18:37 by 投資
內地公布最新的10月份官方製造業採購經理指數（PMI）差強人意，市場預期為49.8，實際49.3；大型企業PMI為49.9，比9月下降0.9個百分點；中型企業PMI為49，高於9月0.4個百分點； 小型企業PMI為47.9，低於9月0.9個百分點；新訂單指數為49.6，比上月下降0.9個百分點，終於降至臨界點之下。

製造業需求的回落，一方面固然是內需疲弱，另一方面是傳統的美國感恩節和聖誕節生產定單今年明顯減少。不是美國經濟出了問題，而是美國廠商減少了向內地工廠下單，內地急需要調整工業生產的成本結構，和加快向工業增值發展。四中全會閉幕，然後是中美會不會簽第一輪貿易協議，可預期噪音會多和千變萬化，勿跟車太貼。
十三五成果見仁見智
而再下一個重頭戲是年底的國務院經濟會議，相信到時市場會開始討論第十四個五年計劃的草稿內容；究竟中國能否在「中國製造2025」這個前題下，完成生產增值，把世界工廠推上另一高層次？相信會有端倪。
回顧一下「十三五」計劃，當年的五大綱要是：

創新 – 升級舊產業與研發新產業；
協調 – 透過統籌資源縮小城鄉差異；
綠色 – 發展生態文明建設和環保式生產；
開放 – 引進之外也要走出去並參與國際規則制定；
共享 – 經濟成果應全民共享縮小差距。

由於不能量化，這五大綱要過去五年到底有幾多做到？有幾多是只聞樓梯響？則屬見仁見智了。「十三五」計劃最標誌性的，絕對就是李克強總理提出的「中國製造2025」，影響力大到連美國總統特朗普都定性為「中國威脅」，視為眼中釘。
簡單而言，「中國製造2025」是未來的行動綱領和路線圖，目標是2025年接近德國、日本實現工業化時的製造強國水準，改善中國「大而不強」的形象。其中核心技術缺芯少核、品牌品質聲望不高、產業結構同質化導致重覆競爭，都是三步走的強國思路。



如以這三項作為指標，缺芯少核在華為事件中表露無遺，中國品牌在這幾年開始有打入國際眼球的案例，例如安踏體育（02020）成為奧委會官方服裝供應商，惟這些品牌在國際市場的收益還有待發掘。
有預測「十四五」內地會確立2020至2030年GDP翻一番的目標；若如是，則未來10年每年的GDP增長不少於6%，難度不低。要保證經濟增速，城鎮化一定要有成績，不能單靠固定資產投資助攻，區塊鏈和互聯網就成為此目標的樞紐建設。
A股缺乏新水支援停滯不前，就算習主席提出了區塊鏈，炒味只維持短時間，看形勢A股11月行情只能靠「十四五」的消息窄幅上落。

Mainland manufacturing PMI is inferior! In November, A shares also watched ""14th Five-Year"" | Luo Shangpei
05 Nov 2019, 18:37 by Investment
The mainland announced the latest October official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) is unsatisfactory, the market expectation is 49.8, the actual 49.3; large enterprises PMI is 49.9, down 0.9 percentage points from September; medium-sized enterprises PMI is 49, higher than September 0.4 The percentage of small business PMI was 47.9, down from 0.9 percentage points in September; the new order index was 49.6, down 0.9 percentage points from the previous month and finally fell below the critical point.

The decline in manufacturing demand, on the one hand, is weak domestic demand, on the other hand, the traditional American Thanksgiving and Christmas production orders have decreased significantly this year. It is not a problem with the US economy. Instead, US manufacturers have reduced their orders to factories in the Mainland. The mainland urgently needs to adjust the cost structure of industrial production and accelerate the development of value-added industries. The Fourth Plenary Session will be closed, and then whether China and the United States will sign the first round of trade agreements. It is expected that the noise will be more varied and ever-changing.
The results of the 13th Five-Year Plan are different
The next major event is the State Council Economic Conference at the end of the year. I believe that the market will start discussing the draft contents of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Can China complete the value-added production under the premise of ""Made in China 2025""? The world factory is pushing another high level? I believe there will be clues.
Looking back at the ""13th Five-Year Plan"", the five outlines of the year should be:

Innovation – upgrading old industries and developing new industries;
Coordination – narrowing urban-rural differences through pooling resources;
Green – development of ecological civilization and environmentally friendly production;
Open – go outside and introduce international rules in the introduction;
Sharing – Economic outcomes should be shared by all citizens to close the gap.

Since it cannot be quantified, how many of these five outlines have been achieved in the past five years? How many are you only smelling the stairs? It is a matter of opinion. The most iconic of the 13th Five-Year Plan is definitely the ""Made in China 2025"" proposed by Premier Li Keqiang. The influence is so great that even President Trump has identified the ""China threat"" as a thorn in the eye.
To put it simply, ""Made in China 2025"" is the future action plan and road map. The goal is to improve the image of China's ""big but not strong"" when it approaches Germany and Japan in 2025. Among them, the core technology lacks core and core, the brand quality is not high, and the homogenization of industrial structure leads to repeated competition, which is a three-step strong country.



If these three items are used as indicators, the core lack of cores is revealed in the Huawei incident. Chinese brands have begun to enter the international eye in the past few years. For example, ANTA Sports (02020) has become the official clothing supplier of the Olympic Committee. The benefits of these brands in the international market remain to be discovered.
It is predicted that the 14th Five-Year Plan will set a target of doubling GDP by 2020 to 2030; if so, the annual GDP growth for the next 10 years will be no less than 6%, which is not difficult. To ensure economic growth, urbanization must have achievements, and can not rely solely on fixed-asset investment to assist, blockchain and the Internet become the hub of this goal.
The lack of new water support in the A-shares has stagnated. Even if Mr. Xi proposed a blockchain, the speculation will only last for a short time. Looking at the situation, the A-share market in November can only be narrowed by the news of the ""14th Five-Year Plan"".
