Stacey and Scott’s four children suffered the agony of him being in jail for three years.
He served the first part of his sentence in Spain after being found guilty of an assault in the nightclub there in 2012.
The couple had planned to wed in 2015 but that had to be cancelled when Scott was extradited to Spain.
Scott, who won two world titles and staged 12 defences before he was stripped of his belt, has vowed to get back to the top of the sport.
