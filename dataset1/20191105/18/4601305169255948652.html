      <h1>New national poll shows top 4 Democrats beating Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:42:12+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/jason" target="_blank">Jason Weisberger</a></address>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/context-card/eea087b6-ca22-4cd9-a254-6bdd49d000a4/">Washington Post/ABC News poll</a> shows just about everyone beating Trump.</p>
      <p>Washington Post:</p>
      <blockquote>Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent).<br/><br/>South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.<br/><br/>The poll reflects national findings; other surveys in the states expected to play an outsize role in the 2020 contest have shown tighter races, particularly in parts of the upper Midwest that Trump flipped from Democrats in 2016.</blockquote>
