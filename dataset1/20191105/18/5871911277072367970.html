      <p>On Saturday night, Furkan Korkmaz probably hit the biggest shot of his entire life.</p>
      <p>He hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 0.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter, lifting the Sixers to a one-point victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
      <p>Korkmaz getting the opportunity to take the last shot was an interesting move, especially with his inconsistent play on both sides of the court throughout his young NBA career.</p>

      <p>Throughout the first six games of this season, it seems as if the Sixers have a strong belief in Korkmaz’s game, especially with his outside shooting.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I saw Furk open — I think he was shocked he was that open — I trusted Furk to make that shot,” <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/ap/korkmaz--pointer-gives-er-s---win-over/article_148e4d4e-1e43-56a7-8c03-e0afc4d90a2c.html">Ben Simmons said after Saturday night’s game</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Simmons is not the only person in the organization who believes in Korkmaz. Sixers general manager Elton Brand and the rest of the front office do too.</p>
      <p>Despite not picking his third-year option along with rumors of Korkmaz wanting to be traded last season. Philadelphia re-signed the 6-foot-7 guard to a two-year deal worth $3.3 million in the offseason.</p>
      <p>By the Sixers making this move, it signaled that they saw something in Korkmaz’s game that they liked and felt they could develop.</p>
      <p>In his first two seasons in the NBA, Korkmaz’s numbers were not stellar from beyond the arc. As a rookie, he only appeared in 14 games with the Sixers and shot 29 percent from three-point range.</p>
      <p>Last season, he received more of an opportunity to play and showed some improvement. In 48 games with the Sixers, Korkmaz shot 32.6-percent from distance and averaged 5.8 points per game.</p>
      <p>Even though we are still in the early stages of the season, Korkmaz has improved in many categories. For starter, the former first-round pick is averaging 8.8 points in 19 minutes per game, both career-highs.</p>
      <p>Additionally, his three-point percentage is now at 40.7 on 4.5 attempts per game.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if Korkmaz gets more minutes and continues to keep knocking down outside shots at a consistent rate. Then he will play an important role in the Sixers’ rotation moving forward.</p>
      <p>After last week’s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, <a href="https://www.nba.com/sixers/news/korkmaz-eager-contribute">Brown said that he wanted to “grow a bomber”</a> and brought up the idea of Korkmaz being that three-point weapon for the Sixers.</p>
      <p>That being said, it appears if Korkmaz is beginning to be that bomber for the Sixers. However, the key going forward for him will be consistency.</p>
