      <h2>Seven-month-old Malakai Paraon's meningococcal meningitis symptoms were dismissed as a pulled elbow and teething pain - three days later her was dead</h2>

      <p>A baby boy died after doctors dismissed his meningococcal meningitis symptoms as teething.</p>
      <p>The parents of seven-month-old Malakai Paraone took their boy to two hospitals and doctor's surgery after he developed a fever and rash.</p>
      <p>The little lad was in pain but doctors diagnosed a pulled elbow and teething problems and sent him home with paracetamol, reports <a href="https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/healthmedicine/baby-who-died-from-meningococcal-sent-home-from-hospital-with-panadol-for-teething-c-541382">7News</a> .</p>
      <p>An inquest into Malakai's death at a hospital in Perth, Australia, was held today.</p>
      <p>It was found that doctors failed to recognise his symptoms when he was sent home from Midland Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in August 2016.</p>

      <p>Dr William Holloway from Princess Margaret Hospital told the inquest that the lack of consistency in Malakai's treatment at the different sites could be a contributory factor in his life "falling through the cracks."</p>
      <p>The lawyer assisting the coroner also conceded this point.</p>
      <p>The coroner heard that Malakai's symptoms were finally recognised by the family's GP and a third visit to the hospital.</p>
      <p>He was hastily returned to Princess Margaret Hospital where he was put on life support.</p>

      <p>But by then, it was too late, and the little lad died three days after he'd first been brought to hospital.</p>
      <p>The child's family is calling for radical changes to be made to Australia's medical system.</p>
      <p>Dr Holloway told the inquest that the system could be reformed to ensure a child's treatment was conducted by the same doctor or hospital every time so that treatment remained consistent.</p>
