Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings dives into stories inspired by the country superstar’s iconic music, spinning a cinematic universe for Dolly Stans. Forget the MCU; bring on the DPCU!
The anthology series will explore eight stories across eight Dolly songs, including “Two Doors Down,” “JJ Sneed,” and of course “Jolene.” The trailer gives us a sneak peek at the full gamut of stories: a World War II-era romance, a Wild West adventure, a courtroom drama, what will probably be a weepy dog movie — and that’s just scratching the surface of the sheer emotional rollercoaster that Heartstrings will undoubtedly wring us through.
This isn’t the first Dolly Parton-focused Netflix original. Last December, Netflix released Dumplin’, a romantic comedy about a plus-size, teenage daughter of a former beauty queen who loves Dolly Parton and enters her town’s annual beauty pageant.
Heartstrings comes out on Netflix on Nov. 22. Till then, we’ll be playing our Best of Dolly Parton playlist on repeat, dreamin’ of days spent in Dollywood, and plotting the next part of the DPCU.
