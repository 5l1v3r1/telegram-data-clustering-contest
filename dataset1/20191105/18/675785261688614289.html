      <h1>Leicester considering £20m transfer swoop for Club Brugge striker Emmanuel Dennis</h1>
      <h2>Leicester are looking for further reinforcements for their front line and manager Brendan Rodgers is a fan of Dennis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:40:50+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers is interested in Club Brugge’s £20million-rated frontman Emmanuel Dennis.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> boss is hunting January reinforcements as the third-placed Foxes look to consolidate their position in the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>Dennis, 21, has three goals in nine league games for Brugge this season and has attracted a string of admirers. He also scored twice against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in the Champions League last month.</p>
      <p>Dennis is thought to be seen as potential competition for Jamie Vardy is the current top scorer in the Premier League this season on 10.</p>
      <p>Rodgers is also keen on Real Sociedad defender Diego Llorente.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old joined La Real two summers ago in a £5m deal from Real Madrid. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and Spurs are among the clubs to have tracked him since then.</p>
      <p>Llorente has a release clause of £45m, but Sociedad are understood not to be under any financial pressure to sell.</p>
      <p>Leicester have won seven of their 11 league games this season and are just two points behind second-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
