內地官方加快推動區塊鏈技術發展的消息，比特幣也出現暴漲行情，一度衝破10,000美元大關。政策層面逐步放開意味區塊鏈體系建設加速，利好整體數字貨幣發展。

區塊鏈可被劃分為三種：

公有鏈
私有鏈
聯盟鏈

每一種區塊鏈都有自己特定的模式和價值。比特幣作為加密貨幣，植根於公有鏈技術支持的去中心化的對等支付網絡，是目前最主要和最活躍的加密貨幣。客戶端互相連接構成比特幣網絡，整個網絡共享包含所有交易信息的公共賬簿，但每筆交易訊息由發送地址對應的用戶訊息保護，達到去中心化記賬。
對於比特幣的投資，類似於看好未來數字經濟的發展，以及其對應的數字貨幣支付系統的構建。數字經濟的發展所催生的互聯網交易需求是推動技術進步的主要動力，而去中心化記賬的模式使得比特幣在跨境支付和匯款的角度提供了積極作用。

年輕投資者易接受
此外，比特幣投資門檻較低，交易模式與網絡生態共通，對新一代投資者有吸引力，有利於社會普及。目前成熟的資本市場對股票、債券、期貨等的投資的專業化要求較高，訊息獲取方式複雜。但比特幣等數字貨幣的投資方式較為簡易，任何擁有手機等移動設備的人士都可以使用和登錄交易網絡。
同時其跨區域和貨幣化的模式與現行網絡生態中的虛擬財富相通，易為年輕投資者接受。由於比特幣獨特的挖礦獎勵機制，比特幣的成本與時間高度相關。這意味著維持比特幣網絡的正常需要緩慢地損耗其保存的價值。
如果與黃金等貴金屬相比，在共同除去人工、商業活動、安保等成本後，比特幣因為其數字資產特點而存在持續性資金投入。投資者購買比特幣，將資金保存以數字財富的形勢保存到比特幣網絡中，並承擔一定程度的隱含衰減，這本質上與任何形式的數字資產配置無異。與其他數字財富不同的是每個比特幣用戶分擔了成本。
提供穩定避險保值功能
但由於規模化挖礦比個體戶更能夠降低固定成本，因此目前比特幣挖礦呈現中心化趨勢。隨著數字經濟的普及，比特幣的市值和交易量會不斷上漲，變相壓低持續投資成本。
同時隨技術進步，電力成本的下降和計算機算力的提升會直接降低持續投資成本，完善比特幣的配置屬性；然而，比特幣存在發行上限和挖礦難度逐步遞增的特點，使得比特幣存在稀缺性。挖礦獎勵的逐步減半會導致稀缺性的上升。
預計明年5月獎勵減半後，比特幣的稀缺性將隨挖礦接近極限而與黃金接近。但與比特幣相比，黃金市值約96,000億美元，比特幣市值約1,800億美元，二者相差約53倍。
比特幣規模較小，尚未能夠構建一個成熟穩定的金融體系，因此其抗風險能力弱，價格波動較大。隨數字經濟發展和數字貨幣普及，擁有充足流動性的比特幣能夠較好地發揮其稀缺性特點，為投資者提供穩定的避險保值功能。免責聲明：本專頁刊載的所有投資分析技巧，只可作參考用途。市場瞬息萬變，讀者在作出投資決定前理應審慎，並主動掌握市場最新狀況。若不幸招致任何損失，概與本刊及相關作者無關。而本集團旗下網站或社交平台的網誌內容及觀點，僅屬筆者個人意見，與新傳媒立場無關。本集團旗下網站對因上述人士張貼之資訊內容所帶來之損失或損害概不負責。

Bitcoin investment threshold is low! Provide stable hedging and preservation function | BOCOM International
05 Nov 2019, 18:31 by Investment
The mainland officially accelerated the news of the development of blockchain technology. Bitcoin also experienced a skyrocketing market, once breaking through the $10,000 mark. The gradual liberalization of the policy level means that the construction of the blockchain system will accelerate, which will benefit the development of the overall digital currency.

Blockchains can be divided into three types:

Public chain
Private chain
Alliance chain

Each blockchain has its own specific model and value. Bitcoin, as a cryptocurrency, is rooted in the decentralized peer-to-peer payment network supported by public-chain technology and is currently the most important and most active cryptocurrency. The clients connect to each other to form a bitcoin network. The entire network shares a common account book containing all transaction information, but each transaction message is protected by a user message corresponding to the sending address, and decentralized accounting is achieved.
The investment in bitcoin is similar to the development of the future digital economy and the construction of its corresponding digital currency payment system. The demand for Internet transactions generated by the development of the digital economy is the main driving force for technological progress, and the decentralized bookkeeping model has enabled Bitcoin to play a positive role in the perspective of cross-border payment and remittance.


The mainland officially accelerated the news of the development of blockchain technology. Bitcoin also experienced a skyrocketing market, once breaking through the $10,000 mark.

Young investors are easy to accept
In addition, the bitcoin investment threshold is low, the transaction model is common to the network ecology, and it is attractive to a new generation of investors and is conducive to social popularization. At present, the mature capital market has higher requirements for specialization of investment in stocks, bonds, futures, etc., and the way of obtaining information is complicated. However, digital currency such as Bitcoin is relatively easy to invest, and anyone with a mobile device such as a mobile phone can use and log in to the trading network.
At the same time, its cross-regional and monetized model is connected to the virtual wealth in the current network ecology and is easily accepted by young investors. Bitcoin's cost is highly correlated with time due to Bitcoin's unique mining incentives. This means that maintaining the normal needs of the Bitcoin network slowly depletes its preserved value.
If compared with precious metals such as gold, Bitcoin has a continuous capital investment due to the characteristics of its digital assets after jointly eliminating labor, commercial activities, security and other costs. Investors buy bitcoin, save the funds in digital wealth and store it in the bitcoin network, and bear a certain degree of implicit decay, which is essentially the same as any form of digital asset allocation. Unlike other digital wealth, every Bitcoin user shares the cost.
Provide stable hedging and preservation
However, due to the fact that large-scale mining is more able to reduce fixed costs than self-employed individuals, bitcoin mining is currently becoming a centralization trend. With the popularity of the digital economy, the market value and trading volume of Bitcoin will continue to rise, and the cost of investment will continue to be low.
At the same time, with the advancement of technology, the decline in power costs and the increase in computer power will directly reduce the continuous investment cost and improve the configuration properties of Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin has the characteristics of increasing the publishing limit and the difficulty of mining, which makes the bitcoin scarce. Sex. A gradual halving of mining incentives will lead to an increase in scarcity.
It is expected that after the halving of the reward in May next year, the scarcity of Bitcoin will be close to gold as mining approaches the limit. But compared with Bitcoin, the market value of gold is about $9.6 trillion, and the market value of bitcoin is about $180 billion, which is about 53 times.
Bitcoin is small in scale and has not yet been able to build a mature and stable financial system. Therefore, its anti-risk ability is weak and price fluctuations are large. With the development of digital economy and the popularization of digital currency, Bitcoin with sufficient liquidity can better exert its scarcity characteristics and provide investors with stable hedging and preservation functions.
