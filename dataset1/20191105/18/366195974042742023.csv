Lil Mosey has been putting in work over the past year and some change. Northsbest helped solidify him as a new artist to keep an eye out for and he hasn't disappointed this year. The rapper's follow-up Certified Hitmaker is set to drop this Friday. Before its release, Mosey came through with another new cut off of the project, ""Live This Wild."" The new single is a strong indication of what we can expect from him on his forthcoming project which is hopefully, certified hits as the project's title suggest.
Mosey's latest single follows a string of drops to build the hype including some high profile collabs. He teamed up with Chris Brown for ""G Walk"" and later, joined forces with Gunna on ""Stuck In A Dream.""
Keep your eyes peeled for Certified Hitmaker.
