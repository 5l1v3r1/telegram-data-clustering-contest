      <h1>Massimiliano Allegri is "best choice" and "ready" for Man Utd, says Marcello Lippi</h1>
      <h2>The former Juventus boss has emerged as a contender for the Bayern job but has been urged to bide his time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:42:27+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Marcello Lippi has tipped <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/massimiliano-allegri">Massimiliano Allegri</a> to be Man Utd manager and claims he would be the "best choice".</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc?service=responsive">Juventus</a> boss Allegri is out of work at present, though has been linked with the current vacancy at Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> have struggled so far this season under the stewardship of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, although there are no signs to suggest the club are preparing to part with the Norwegian.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marcello-lippi">Lippi</a> feels Allegri is "ready" to end the "dark years" at Old Trafford should he be given the opportunity in the hotseat.</p>
      <p>Lippi told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7631469/Marcello-Lippi-backs-Massimiliano-Allegri-Manchester-United.html">the Mail</a> : "Allegri would be good everywhere and as a great admirer of the English club I would be happy to see him take over.</p>

      <p>“My deep friendship with [Sir Alex] Ferguson allows me to say that he would be the best choice for United.</p>
      <p>“Allegri studies English and is perfect for the British style. He is prepared and shrewd. He reads the game with great ease.</p>
      <p>“He loves challenges and I respect him a lot, I think he is serious and prepared, I think he is a humble person. A great Italian who would do very well in England.</p>
      <p>“I can tell you that he is ready for United.”</p>

      <p>Allegri boasts an impressive CV, having led Juventus to back-to-back titles in all five of his seasons at the helm.</p>
      <p>His team also doubled up in four of those seasons, winning the Coppa Italia in every year of his reign except the last.</p>
      <p>Juve also reached two Champions League finals in just three years, but came runners-up on both occasions.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old has emerged as a contender for the Bayern post after the club parted ways with Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>But former England boss Fabio Capello believes he should turn down any approach, and wait for contact from the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>“He’d be a good fit at Bayern Munich, although I don’t know how welcome Italians are in Germany after Ancelotti," Capello told <a href="https://www.raiplayradio.it/audio/2019/10/RADIO-ANCHaposIO-SPORT-ba43f013-f3d8-4c49-b41e-2cfba8953570.html">Radio Anch’io Sport</a> <i>.</i></p>
      <p>“England’s exciting, there’s the possibility of working well and the Premier League is a championship that enriches you. If I was Allegri, I’d go to Manchester.”</p>
