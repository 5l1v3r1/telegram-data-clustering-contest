      <p>Demonstrators wearing Guy Fawkes masks, a worldwide symbol of protest, marched in downtown Hong Kong on Tuesday to mark the one-month anniversary of the mask ban.</p>
      <p>Police were not seen, even though the protesters were violating the ban on the use of facial coverings at rallies.</p>
      <p>Protests in recent weeks have been marked by violence as hardcore anti-government demonstrators set fires and trashed facilities in clashes with police who used tear gas, and brawls occurred between demonstrators and pro-Chinese activists.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on the sidelines of a trade event in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>Lam said Xi showed support to the Hong Kong government's action in dealing with the recent unrest in the semi-autonomous city.</p>
