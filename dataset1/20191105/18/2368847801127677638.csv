高天韻：德國動畫片還原1989 中國故事你可知？

05 Nov 2019, 18:02

10月9日，一部動畫大片在德國上映——《弗利茨：巨變中的神奇故事》以兒童的視角講述了1989年萊比錫和柏林的民主運動，融匯了準確、豐富的歷史細節，再現當年的特殊氛圍，深獲好評。
故事的主角是12歲女孩弗利茨，她和好友索菲生活在東德。夏天到了，索菲與家人去匈牙利度假，後來逃往西德，這對夥伴暫時天各一方。弗利茨在尋找索菲的過程中，見證了風起雲湧的抗爭，柏林牆最終被人民推倒。
影片改編自漢娜·紹特（Hannah Schott）2009年創作的兒童書，原題為「弗利茨也在：巨變中的神奇故事」（Fritzi War Dabei. Eine Wendewundergeschichte）。據德國之聲採訪報導，當時，一家出版社向紹特約稿，原因是：在德國，沒有關於柏林牆的少兒讀物。紹特完成此書後，時常走訪小學校，為孩子們朗讀弗利茨的歷險，與他們談論相關話題。
德國文化機構如此重視向小學生普及歷史常識，令人印象深刻。今年，柏林市政府撥款一千萬歐元，組織了兩百多場活動，定於11月4日到10日舉行，隆重紀念德國和平革命的成功和柏林牆倒塌。
對於一個國家和民族來說，回顧與反思歷史、挖掘和傳播真相，極其重要。這項工作需要投入財力、物力與人力，顯然應由政府致力推動，而且應當持續不斷。
德國保存了混合著沉重、痛苦、肅穆、希望的記憶，中國呢？中國人能否自由地觸碰真實的歷史？
70年來，在中原大地上，在接連不斷的政治鬥爭和人權迫害中，8千萬生命非正常死亡，可是，迄今，不見一座悼念受難者的紀念碑。公開檢討「文革」、「六四」都不被允許，法輪功仍被迫害並是禁忌話題。許多學者傾盡心血、冒著危險撰寫的真相著作被封殺，良心記者和作家飽受打壓。今日，十四億中國人被封閉在另類「柏林牆」內，被迫面對謊言和扭曲的歷史，民族的記憶和精神在一點一點地流失。

「反右」與夾邊溝慘案

夾邊溝農場位於甘肅省酒泉市沙漠邊緣，1957年至1961年間，大約3000名「右派分子」被關押在這裡。由於適逢大饑荒，大多數勞教人員在此地活活餓死，「夾邊溝」因此慘案而聞名。
2014年12月，張遂卿等幾位夾邊溝倖存者不辭辛苦地籌建成一座夾邊溝罹難者紀念碑，數日後，酒泉肅州區政府派人將石碑徹底砸毀，墓園的圓形墓圈被剷平，安葬的難友遺骨被掘出。
2017年初，廣州中山大學教授艾曉明歷時20個月，完成了6個小時的紀錄片《夾邊溝祭事》。這部作品在香港首映，卻不能與大陸觀眾正式見面。她表示，自己走出書齋去做這些事情，是因為中國的這個現實苦難太深重了；要想推動中國走向開放、民主，研究中共造成的苦難史、思考改變困境的出路是必要的。
重慶學者譚松致力於調查中共土改及反右等事件的真相，因此曾被當局抓捕和無理解聘。他在調查實錄《長壽湖》後記中寫道：「那麼多作家都在歌唱光明，讚頌偉大，而那麼多血淚、那麼多真實無人理睬，我只得選擇後者。」他說，他要搶救歷史，拒絕讓血腥的歷史真實被吞噬和淹沒。

大饑荒與《墓碑》

2008年12月，《墓碑——中國六十年代大饑荒紀實》由香港天地圖書出版，此書多次再版，被稱為「最暢銷的中國禁書」。2012年，英、法、德、日文譯本發行。作者楊繼繩是退休的新華社記者，他因此力作獲得多項榮譽。
2016年，75歲的楊繼繩被哈佛大學尼曼學會授予「萊昂斯新聞良知與正義獎」，卻被中共當局禁止出境。美國媒體發表了他擬好的領獎感言，其中寫道：「《墓碑》這本書記錄了一場持續數年的慘烈人禍。雖然它只能在香港出版，是大陸的禁書，但是，追求真相的人們，通過種種渠道、種種方式，在大陸廣為傳播，從中原腹地到雲貴高原到新疆邊塞，都不時有盜版《墓碑》銷售。來自全國各地的大量讀者來信，給我以我堅定而熱情地支持。這說明，真相有強大的穿透力，它可以衝破行政權力構築的銅牆鐵壁！」

文革的紀錄

「假如能建立一座文革博物館，應該把每一個受難者的名字刻寫在博物館的牆上；假如能出版一本文革浩劫死難者紀念冊，應該把每一個死難者的故事白紙黑字印刷出來。」這是2001年4月，王友琴為「中國文革受難者紀念園」網站所寫的前言中的幾句話。
王友琴幾十年從事文革研究，收集了將近700位文革死難者的材料。2004年，她出版了《文革受難者》，她在書序裡說，「……探索和記錄歷史事實，是學者的責任。」
宋永毅是另一位研究文革的知名學者。他與同事們建立了《中國當代政治史數據庫》，收錄了三萬多個文件，共近三億字，包括《中國文化大革命數據庫（1966–1976）》、《中國反右運動數據庫》、《中國大躍進——大饑荒數據庫（1958–1964）》以及《中國五十年代初中期的政治運動資料庫：從土地改革到公私合營（1949–1956）》。
宋永毅曾談到中共體制導致的文革屠殺的罪惡：「你（中共）說5%是階級敵人，那至少就有2000多萬人被打成賤民，隨便地殘殺他們、虐待他們。他們是豬啊？他們不是人啊？所謂的美好社會把他們殺死，毫無罪惡感！」
《紅色紀念碑》講述文革期間在廣西發生的大屠殺和人吃人恐怖事件，作者鄭義曾說，命運安排他經歷了文革，是為了讓他將來作證，「特別是為那些沒有話語權的人——那些死去的和卑微的人作證。」
北京作家徐星獨立製作了紀錄片《罪行摘要》，簡述了14位農民遭遇的文革冤獄。他們被迫害至妻離子散，人生被毀。徐星說：「我覺得我們的歷史被層層的謊言覆蓋，最有力的對謊言的戳穿和顛覆，可能不都是很概念化的、理論化的批判、討論，常常是一個有力量的細節就會戳穿這些謊言。」徐星曾質疑，「這不是國家該做的事情嗎？為什麼不做這些對歷史、後代有交代的事？」

法輪功受迫害案

1999年7月，中共江澤民集團發動了對法輪功群體的鎮壓，迫害持續至今，造成大批法輪功學員致死、致殘、致瘋，波及上億中國人，中共仇恨宣傳並且輸出海外。學者指出，這是中國和人類歷史上最慘烈的人權災難。
20年來，法輪功學員和正義人士撰寫了大量調查報告、紀實文學作品，攝製了許多反映法輪功和平抗暴、揭露中共迫害真相的影視片和紀錄片，在國內外產生了較大的影響。其中一些作品聚焦中共活摘器官的罪惡，極具震撼力。然而，所有這些文字報導和視頻節目都被中共當局封禁。
大陸作家杜斌曾拍攝紀錄片，揭發馬三家勞教所對法輪功學員及上訪者實施酷刑。他說，在這個所謂歌舞昇平的時代，一個人去追逐物質享樂，即使過度出格也不會受到當局的責難；但是，如果一個人想拿起筆、照相機或攝影機去書寫和記錄這個社會正在發生的某些事情的時候，這個人就會被當局騷擾和暴力威脅，甚至會被認為是要顛覆政權。
* * * * * *
今天，德國民眾能夠去到勃蘭登堡門、亞歷山大廣場、萊比錫的聖尼古拉教堂，傾聽30年前的萬人吶喊；他們得以親睹殘餘的柏林牆體，憑弔因穿越鐵幕而被射殺的同胞；他們還可以走進電影院，與弗利茨一起踏上冒險之旅，隨蒲公英飄飛、感受自由的美好。
中國人民急需真相，亟待在真相中縱覽這個時代的悲慘、壯烈、抗爭、追尋，體驗苦難血淚，重建真實、完整的民族記憶。

Gao Tianyun: German cartoons restore 1989 Chinese story you know?

05 Nov 2019, 18:02

On October 9th, an animated blockbuster was released in Germany - ""Flitz: The Magical Story in the Great Change"" tells the 1989 Leipzig and Berlin democracy movement from a child's perspective, blending accurate and rich historical details. Reappearing the special atmosphere of the year, it was well received.
The protagonist of the story is 12-year-old girl Fritz, who lives in East Germany with her friend Sophie. Summer is here, Sophie and her family went to Hungary for a holiday, and later fled to West Germany. In the process of searching for Sophie, Fritz witnessed the ups and downs of the storm, and the Berlin Wall was eventually overthrown by the people.
The film is adapted from Hannah Schott's 2009 children's book, originally titled ""Fritzi War Dabei. Eine Wendewundergeschichte"". According to an interview with Deutsche Welle, at the time, a publishing house submitted a draft to Shao Te because the reason was that there were no children's books about the Berlin Wall in Germany. After completing this book, Sauer often visited the primary school to read the adventures of Fritz for the children and talked about related topics.
It is impressive that German cultural institutions attach so much importance to popularizing historical knowledge among primary school students. This year, the Berlin municipal government allocated 10 million euros and organized more than 200 events, scheduled to be held from November 4th to 10th, to commemorate the success of the German peace revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall.
For a country and a nation, it is extremely important to review and reflect on history, and to discover and disseminate the truth. This work requires financial, material and human resources. It is clearly up to the government to promote it and it should be continuous.
Germany has preserved memories of heavy, painful, solemn, and hopeful, China? Can Chinese people freely touch real history?
In the 70 years, on the land of the Central Plains, 80 million lives have died abnormally in successive political struggles and human rights persecution. However, so far, there is no monument to mourn the victims. A public review of the ""Cultural Revolution"" and ""June 4th"" is not allowed. Falun Gong is still persecuted and a taboo topic. Conscience reporters and writers have been suppressed by many scholars who have devoted their efforts and risked writing. Today, 1.4 billion Chinese are confined to the alternative ""Berlin Wall"" and forced to face the history of lies and distortions. The memory and spirit of the nation are lost little by little.

""Anti-Right"" and the Jiabiangou Massacre

The Jiabiangou Farm is located on the edge of the desert in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Between 1957 and 1961, about 3,000 “rightists” were detained here. Due to the great famine, most of the reeducation-through workers were starving to death here, and the ""Zibiangou"" was famous for the tragedy.
In December 2014, Zhang Yuqing and several survivors of the Jiabiangou worked tirelessly to build a monument to the victims of the Jiabiangou. A few days later, the Jiuquan District Government of Jiuquan sent people to completely destroy the stone monument. The remains of the burying friends were excavated.
At the beginning of 2017, Ai Xiaoming, a professor at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, lasted for 20 months and completed the 6-hour documentary ""Chambian Ditch Festival"". This work premiered in Hong Kong but could not officially meet with mainland audiences. She said that she went out of the study to do these things because China's actual suffering is too deep. To promote China's openness and democracy, it is necessary to study the history of suffering caused by the CCP and think about ways to change the predicament.
Chongqing scholar Tan Song is committed to investigating the truth about the CCP's land reform and anti-rightist events, so he was arrested by the authorities and hired without understanding. In his post-recorded ""Longevity Lake"", he wrote: ""So many writers are singing and praising the great, and so many tears, so many real and unreasonable, I have to choose the latter."" He said that he wants to save history. Refusing to let the bloody history be swallowed up and drowned.

Great Famine and Tombstone

In December 2008, ""Tombstone - China's Famine in the 1960s"" was published by the Hong Kong Sky Map Book. This book was republished many times and was called ""the best-selling Chinese ban."" In 2012, English, French, German and Japanese translations were issued. Author Yang Jisheng is a retired Xinhua News Agency reporter, and he has thus won many honors.
In 2016, 75-year-old Yang Jisheng was awarded the ""Leons News Conscience and Justice Award"" by the Nieman Institute of Harvard University, but was banned from the country by the Chinese authorities. The American media published his proposed speech of the award, which wrote: ""The book ""Tombstone"" records a tragic man-made disaster that lasts for several years. Although it can only be published in Hong Kong, it is a ban on the mainland, but the pursuit of truth. People, through various channels and various ways, spread widely in the mainland, from the hinterland of the Central Plains to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the borders of Xinjiang. From time to time, there are pirated ""tombstones"" for sale. Letters from a large number of readers from all over the country give me my firm and enthusiastic Supporting the land. This shows that the truth has a strong penetrating power, which can break through the iron wall of administrative power!""

Cultural record

""If you can build a Cultural Revolution Museum, you should write the name of each victim on the wall of the museum. If you can publish a commemorative book of the catastrophe, you should print the story of each victim in black and white."" This is 2001. In April, Wang Youqin wrote a few words in the foreword written on the website of the ""Chinese Cultural Revolution Victims Memorial Park"".
Wang Youqin has been engaged in cultural revolution research for decades and has collected nearly 700 materials for the victims of the Cultural Revolution. In 2004, she published the ""Cultural Revolution Victims"", she said in the book preface, ""...exploring and recording historical facts is the responsibility of scholars.""
Song Yongyi is another well-known scholar who studied the Cultural Revolution. He and his colleagues have established the ""China Contemporary Political History Database"", which contains more than 30,000 documents, totaling nearly 300 million words, including ""China Cultural Revolution Database (1966–1976)"", ""China Anti-Right Movement Database"", China's Great Leap Forward - The Great Famine Database (1958–1964) and the Chinese Political Movement Database in the Early 1950s: From Land Reform to Public-Private Partnerships (1949–1956).
Song Yongyi once talked about the evil of the Cultural Revolution caused by the CCP system: ""You (the Communist Party) said that 5% are class enemies, and at least 20 million people have been beaten into the public, killing them casually and abusing them. They are pigs. Are they not human? The so-called good society kills them without guilt!""
""Red Monument"" tells about the massacre and human horror in Guangxi during the Cultural Revolution. The author Zheng Yi once said that fate arranged him to go through the Cultural Revolution in order to let him testify in the future, ""especially for those who have no right to speak."" Those who are dead and humble will testify.""
Xu Xing, a Beijing-based writer, independently produced a documentary, ""The Crime Summary,"" which outlines the Cultural Revolution's prisons suffered by 14 farmers. They were persecuted to their wives and their lives were destroyed. Xu Xing said: ""I feel that our history is covered by layers of lies. The most powerful debunking and subversion of lies may not be very conceptual, theoretical criticism, discussion, often a powerful detail. Will smear these lies."" Xu Xing once questioned, ""Is this not the thing the state should do? Why not do these things that are relevant to history and future generations?""

Falun Gong persecution case

In July 1999, the Jiang Zemin Group of the Communist Party launched a crackdown on the Falun Gong community. The persecution continued to this day, causing a large number of Falun Gong practitioners to die, maiming, and madness, affecting hundreds of millions of Chinese, CCP’s hate propaganda and exporting overseas. Scholars pointed out that this is the most tragic human rights disaster in the history of China and mankind.
In the past 20 years, Falun Gong practitioners and justice people have written a large number of investigation reports and documentary literary works. They have produced many films and documentaries that reflect Falun Gong's peaceful resistance to violence and expose the CCP's persecution. They have had a great impact at home and abroad. Some of these works focus on the sin of the CCP's live organ harvesting and are extremely powerful. However, all these text reports and video programs were banned by the Chinese authorities.
Mainland writer Du Bin has filmed a documentary about the torture of Falun Gong practitioners and petitioners at the three labor camps in Malaysia. He said that in this era of so-called singing and dancing, a person chasing material pleasure, even if it is excessively out of the box, will not be blamed by the authorities; but if one wants to pick up a pen, camera or camera to write and record some of the things that are happening in this society When things happen, this person will be harassed by the authorities and threatened by violence, and even considered to be subverting the regime.
* * * * * *
Today, the German people can go to the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, St. Nicholas Church in Leipzig, and listen to the screams of people 30 years ago; they were able to kiss the remnants of the Berlin Wall and rely on the iron curtain The compatriots who shot; they can also walk into the cinema and embark on an adventure with Fritz, flying with dandelions and feeling the beauty of freedom.
The Chinese people urgently need the truth. It is urgent to look at the tragic, heroic, resistance, and pursuit of this era in the truth, to experience the blood and tears of suffering, and to rebuild the true and complete national memory.
