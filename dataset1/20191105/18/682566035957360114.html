      <p>AbujaÂ  - A <b>Nigerian </b>court on Tuesday dropped a high-profile corruption case against football federation president<b> Amaju Pinnick</b> and four top officials after the authorities withdrew the charges.</p>
      <p>The football bosses had been facing a raft of accusations including over the alleged theft of $8.4 million paid by FIFA for Nigeria's participation at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Judge Ijeoma Ojukwu said she had "no choice" but to order the case ditched after the prosecution asked to drop some of the charges.</p>
      <p>The government in September dissolved the anti-corruption agency prosecuting the case over its own graft scandal.</p>
      <p>The case had been repeatedly adjourned since the football officials were charged in May as they failed to answer summons to appear in court.</p>
      <p>The ruling on Tuesday is not the end of Pinnick's troubles as he is facing another potential trial for graft.</p>
      <p>Last month the authorities seized a dozen properties from senior officials of Nigeria's top football body, including Pinnick, in a fresh corruption probe.</p>
      <p>Anti-graft agents took over 12 properties - half belonging to Pinnick, including a property in London - in the latest investigation to target senior football bosses.</p>
      <p>Pinnick has remained at the helm of Nigerian football's governing body despite the graft allegations.</p>
      <p>He was sacked as vice-president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in July.</p>
