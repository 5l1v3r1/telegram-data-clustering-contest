      <p>Lil Mosey has been putting in work over the past year and some change. <i>Northsbest</i> helped solidify him as a new artist to keep an eye out for and he hasn't disappointed this year. The rapper's follow-up <i>Certified Hitmaker</i> is set to drop this Friday. Before its release, Mosey came through with another new cut off of the project, "Live This Wild." The new single is a strong indication of what we can expect from him on his forthcoming project which is hopefully, certified hits as the project's title suggest.</p>
      <p>Mosey's latest single follows a string of drops to build the hype including some high profile collabs. He teamed up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ChrisBrown/profile">Chris Brown</a> for "G Walk" and later, joined forces with <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tags/gunna/">Gunna</a> on "Stuck In A Dream."</p>
      <p>Keep your eyes peeled for <i>Certified Hitmaker.</i></p>
