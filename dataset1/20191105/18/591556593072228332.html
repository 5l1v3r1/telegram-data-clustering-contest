      <h1>Seven out of ten Americans have chatbot fatigue</h1>

        <b>Do we still embrace the rise of the chatbot for customer support? How does AI impact our experiences online?</b>
      </p>
      <p>What do we want in our interactions with brands when we need to contact customer support or sales teams?  A recent report shows that the rise of the AI chatbot is not progressing as well as hoped.  <br/><br/>Recent research from New York, NY-based outsourcing company <a href="https://www.cgsinc.com/en">CGS</a> shows how AI impacts the customer experience.</p>
      <p>Its <a href="https://www.cgsinc.com/en/resources/2019-CGS-Customer-Service-Chatbots-Channels-Survey">customer service chatbots and channels</a> survey looked at how customers felt about AI and automation-based interactions. It polled over 1,000 US consumers to better understand their preferences around customer service interactions. <br/><br/>It wanted to discover what channels they are more likely to use when dealing with stressful situations and how they feel about automation. <br/><br/>The survey showed that there is a clear age gap in the acceptance of automation. Almost nine out of ten (86%) of consumers prefer to interact with a human agent, and over seven out of ten (71%) respondents said they would be less likely to use a brand if it did not have human customer service representatives available.</p>
      <p>Respondents, aged between 25 to 44, are 2.5 times more likely to use chatbots to ask a quick question, compared to 18-24 year olds. Over one-third of women were happy using chat to ask a quick question compared to one-quarter of men.</p>

      <p>However almost seven out of ten (69%) were more comfortable asking a complex question by phone or voice, compared to only 1% who preferred to use a video channel.</p>
      <p>Over one-third of respondents said that they felt that AI was 'maddening', 'unable to fully address their needs', or 'sci-fi futuristic' when relating to customer service. <br/><br/>When faced with stressful situations customers said that they were likely to use the phone as their preferred channel. Over seven out of ten (71%) wanted to use the phone compared to 12% who preferred chat or DM. <br/><br/>When considering AI, 13% of consumers find chatbot interactions "maddening" while 8% find them to be impersonal. Only 2% thought it was a job killer. <br/><br/>However, when making an inquiry through a texting-based messaging service for customer support a huge (86%) of US customers preferred to interact with a human compared to an AI-based system. <br/><br/>Steven Petruk, president, Global Outsourcing division, CGS said: "From our survey, it appears that this transformation to AI-driven technology may be occurring faster than the consumers' willingness to embrace it."<br/><br/>Petruk is certainly right. Even though I love technology, I turn away from basic chatbots -- like the simplified bot that pops up on the CGS site itself. I am quick to close the chat interface window when I have no flexibility to respond. <br/><br/>I do not want to select from a pre-selected set of responses to answer the bot's questions. I want my free text questions to be interpreted using machine learning. <br/><br/>Until AI bots attain that level of intelligence and are able to respond to more complex questions, customer service satisfaction levels will not improve.</p>
