1. 長和、長建有無潛力？
想問下買入長和（0001）、長建（1038）等「李氏股票」是否還有潛力？ 因為近期1仔跌了很多，其實我對該企業有信心，但一直留意你的分享，發現你只建議投資電能（0006）、港燈（2638），所以想請教一下！

龔成老師：

長和系都有質素的！當中以長建（1038）較有潛在增長力，而電能（0006）、港燈（2638）則屬收息型，長和（0001）算是平穩型。所以要視乎你的投資目標，長和系現價是合理的。長建受歐洲影響，中短期會較弱，但企業近年仍有買資產，相信長遠會逐漸在股價反映當中價值。

2. 內房物管股值得買？
龔sir，想問問你中海物業（2669）/ 碧桂園服務（6098） / 雅生活服務（3319）等內房物管股的看法。

龔成老師：

物管企業其實不錯，現金流穩定，加上有背後企業的支持，不少生意都能保持增長，長遠發展不差。但要留意現價會否昂貴，因為這類股間中有炒作，買入時要留意股價。
雅生活服務（3319）投資值博率較高，有質素且現價不算貴，但這刻仍未到便宜區，投資最好分注買入。
3. 金沙 VS 銀娛
老師，你一直看好濠賭業，為甚麽主要推薦金沙而不是銀娛？後者爆發力不是更勝一籌嗎？

龔成老師：

其實兩隻都是有質素的股票，都適合投資的。
只是金沙（1928）相對會較穩陣，同時股息較高，適合較多數投資者；銀娛（0027）十分優質，其增長力較金沙強，但穩定性就不及金沙了。因此，需要視乎你投資的目標再作決定！
4. 中生製藥咩價位入？
龔Sir，中生製藥（1177）我在$7.1入貨，早前我止賺放掉了，另外我組合有很多蟹貨，請問甚麼價位可以再入1177？

龔成老師：

其實，你持有的蟹貨，與你是否再入這股是無關的，你整個投資概念有問題。我們不應該以「賺蝕」去衡量那隻股票賣出，應該以「企業質素」去決定，而且應該建立一個優質、平衡的組合。
中生製藥（1177）是優質股，你不應賣，另外，如果你手上的蟹貨是劣質股的話，則應該賣。兩者沒有必然的買賣關係，你要清楚投資概念。現時中生製藥已略貴，不建議強行追貨，待跌10至20%才入。你先持有現金，或買入盈富（2800）都可以。
5. 港鐵、維他奶及大快活
龔Sir，請問港鐵（0066）、維他奶（0345）及大快活（0052）算不算平？後市怎看？現金及股票的比例應該是幾多？另外，近期數據有下跌跡象，有沒有需要將股票賣出，轉買防守股？

龔成老師：

首先，這幾隻都是有質素的股票，且股價較高位回落了不少。港鐵（0066），賺錢能力強，近期只是一些中短期的事件，未有影響企業的長期價值，這刻是適合做月供股票的。
港鐵收入主要有運輸、收租及地產等，如果你從長遠角度分析近期事件，就會知最近事件對港鐵的長遠影響很少。雖然近期成本增加，亦影響了運輸收入，但未有影響長期情況。現時港鐵處於合理區，未到便宜，因為過往股價算貴。
維他奶（0345）這刻仍算是貴，因為過往很貴，回落那麼多仍未到合理區，要落多一些才算合理。至於大快活（0052），現價合理，但由於人工成本增加，加上香港目前的情況，都影響其中短期股價，但股票本質沒有變。你這幾隻持貨，由於本身有質素，因此不需賣出，但你預股價在中短期較波動，要長線投資才可以。

Does Changhe and Changjian have potential? Is MTR suitable for monthly stocks? | Gong Chengxin Box
05 Nov 2019, 18:44 by Gong Cheng
The Hang Seng Index has risen for 4 days. Many investors want to take the opportunity to enter the market. This time, readers have asked questions about the department and the property management stocks and gambling stocks. Mr. Gong Cheng gave many suggestions on individual shares, that is, look!
Written by: Gong Cheng | Photo: New Media Reference Room
1. Is there any potential for Changhe and Changjian?
Would you like to ask if there is still potential to buy ""Li's stock"" such as Changhe (0001) and Changjian (1038)? Because I have fallen a lot in the recent past, I actually have confidence in the company, but I have been paying attention to your sharing. I found that you only recommend investing in power (0006) and Hongkong Electric (2638), so I would like to ask!

Teacher Gong Cheng:

The long and the system are of quality! Among them, Changjian (1038) has a potential growth potential, while electric energy (0006) and Hongkong Electric (2638) are income-bearing types, and long-sum (0001) is a stationary type. So depending on your investment objectives, the current price of Changhe is reasonable. Changjian is affected by Europe and will be weak in the short to medium term. However, the company still buys assets in recent years. It is believed that the long-term will gradually reflect the value in the stock price.

2. Is the house property stock worth buying?
Gong sir, I would like to ask you about the property of Zhonghai Property (2669) / Country Garden Service (6098) / Ya Life Service (3319) and other property management stocks.

Teacher Gong Cheng:

The property management company is actually good, the cash flow is stable, and with the support of the companies behind it, many businesses can maintain growth, and the long-term development is not bad. However, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the current price will be expensive, because there is speculation in this type of stock, and you should pay attention to the stock price when buying.
Ya Life Services (3319) has a high investment rate, quality and current price is not expensive, but this time has not yet reached the cheap area, the investment is best to buy.
3. Sands VS GE Entertainment
Teacher, you have always been optimistic about the gambling industry. Why do you mainly recommend Sands instead of GEG? Is the explosive power of the latter not better?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

In fact, both are stocks with quality, which are suitable for investment.
Only Sands (1928) will be relatively stable, and the dividends are higher, suitable for a larger number of investors; GEG (0027) is very good, its growth is stronger than Sands, but its stability is not as good as Sands. Therefore, it is necessary to make a decision depending on the target of your investment!
4. What is the price of Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical?
Gong Sir, Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical (1177) I entered the goods at $7.1. Earlier, I stopped earning it. In addition, I have a lot of crabs in my portfolio. What price can I re-enter 1177?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

In fact, the crab products you hold are irrelevant to whether you re-enter this stock. Your entire investment concept has problems. We should not use ""profit eclipse"" to measure the sale of that stock. It should be determined by ""enterprise quality"" and a quality and balanced combination should be established.
Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical (1177) is a quality stock. You should not sell it. In addition, if the crab products in your hand are inferior stocks, you should sell them. There is no inevitable buying and selling relationship between the two, you have to understand the concept of investment. At present, Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical is slightly more expensive. It is not recommended to forcibly pursue the goods. It will be reduced by 10 to 20%. You can hold cash first, or buy a profit (2800).
5. MTR, Vitasoy and Big Happiness
Gong Sir, may I ask if MTR (0066), Vitasoy (0345) and Big Happiness (0052) are not equal? What do you think of the market outlook? What percentage of cash and stock should be? In addition, recent data have shown signs of decline. Do you need to sell stocks and buy defensive stocks?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

First of all, these are all stocks with quality, and the stock price has fallen back a lot. MTR (0066) has strong ability to make money. In the near future, it is only a short-term and medium-term event that has not affected the long-term value of the company. This moment is suitable for making monthly stocks.
MTR revenues mainly include transportation, rent collection and real estate. If you analyze recent events from a long-term perspective, you will know that the recent events have had little impact on the MTR. Although the recent increase in costs has also affected transportation revenues, it has not affected the long-term situation. At present, the MTR is in a reasonable area and it is not cheap, because the past share price is expensive.
Vitasoy (0345) is still expensive at this moment, because it used to be expensive, and it has not yet reached a reasonable area. It is reasonable to drop more. As for the big happy (0052), the current price is reasonable, but due to the increase in labor costs, and the current situation in Hong Kong, it affects the short-term stock price, but the nature of the stock has not changed. You only have the goods, because they have quality, so you do not need to sell, but your pre-share price is more volatile in the short to medium term, you need long-term investment.
