Inflatable lumbar back support that makes travel a lot easier
05 Nov 2019, 18:21 by Jason Weisberger
I do not like to travel without my McKenzie AirBack.
The self-inflating McKenzie AirBack makes travel a lot more comfortable. This pillow allows me to move around the globe without awful backpain.
I have long felt the massive amounts of flying about the globe I did in my late-20s and 30s heavily contributed to the terrible problems I have with my lowerback. Bad seats, bad posture and absolutely no clue that the things I was doing would later hobble me. Decent lumbar support would have made the travel much less destructive.
The McKenzie AirBack is made of great materials, lasts until I lose and is the best shape I've found for a lumber travel pillow. The taper of the McKenzie's hourglass shape seems to wedge well into mosts seats. The pillow doesn't move about.
I fidget. Other pillows will squirt out of place as I move about. The AirBack stays where I need it.
