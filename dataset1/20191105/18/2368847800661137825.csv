橫河：美國會推動「台北法案」是否挑戰中共底線

05 Nov 2019, 18:11

（本文是美國時事評論員橫河在希望之聲廣播電台訪談。以下為節目實錄。）
美國參院和眾院外交委員會通過「台北法案」，對美中台各意味著什麼，和「台灣關係法」及美中三個公報有何關係？中共在一中問題上究竟底線是什麼？國務卿蓬佩奧和前議長金里奇的演講又反映了什麼樣的美國政府政策和民意？
主持人：楊光
嘉賓：橫河
主持人：聽眾朋友好，歡迎您收聽《橫河評論》，我是楊光。橫河：我是橫河，大家好。
主持人：在過去的一個星期裡，美國的幾位重量級人物先後的對中美關係發表講話，一個是美國的國務親蓬佩奧，他強調美國要正面面對中共的挑戰，但是他在講話中又很明確的說，中共和中國人民是不同的。另外一位是美國的前眾議院議長金里奇先生，他則講到中美意識形態不同，當初大家對鄧小平的「黑貓白貓理論」都理解錯了，他就講了他自己具體的例子。
那麼在這種環境下，參議院和眾議院的外交委員會在這幾天又一致的通過了「台北法案」，那麼美國是不是在挑戰「一個中國」的底線呢？中美台的關係會如何走向呢？我們今天就請橫河先生來點評一下。
橫河先生，我們知道這個星期美國參議院和眾議院外交委員會都通過了「台北法案」，新聞上把這個當作一個非常大的進展，您覺得離正式生效還有多遠呢？
橫河：這個法案是29日參議院通過的，眾議院的外交委員會也在30日通過了，然後就要送給眾議院的全體討論通過，再協調出一個參眾兩院同樣的版本來，之後還需要總統簽署成為法律。因為現在的參眾兩院的版本差別不大，所以這部分不會有問題；另外從目前國際形勢和美中關係來看的話，總統簽署也不會有太大的障礙，所以我認為這個法案通過以後正式生效不會很久。
主持人：從去年2月份，美國通過了《台灣旅行法》，從那個時候開始美台關係就開始升溫，這個「台北法案」的內容大概是有什麼方面？是不是標誌著美國對台灣政策的正式轉向呢？
橫河：從名字我們可以知道「台北法案」的內容有哪些，「台北法案」這個詞直接是來自英文TAIPEI Act，就是「台北法案」，但是這裡的台北，TAIPEI不是台北的意思，不是台北市這個城市的意思，而是一種英文的縮寫，這個來自這個法案的全文，全文英文的每個字的頭一個字母拼起來正好是「TAIPEI」，換成中文就是叫「2019台灣友邦國際保護及強化倡議法案」，就這意思。它的基礎是《台灣關係法》，我們知道《台灣關係法》是美中正式建交以後國會通過的法律，1979年1月1日生效的，也是這些年來美台關係的一個法律基礎。
「台北法案」主要是針對中共近年來挖走了多個台灣的邦交國，並且在全世界封殺和矮化台灣這些外交活動，法案就要求美國行政當局要採取行動，定期檢查台灣邦交和世界各個國家對台灣的政策，要制定和執行相應的對策，這個就包括對台灣現有的邦交國，還有非邦交國，現在邦交國只剩下17個了嘛。
檢查什麼呢？就是這些國家是不是改變了和台灣的邦交狀態，或者是降低了現有的非正式邦交的關係，也就是說他鼓勵現有的邦交國來跟台灣維持邦交；而鼓勵非邦交國，就是大部分國家跟台灣沒有外交關係嘛，去加強和台灣的非官方連繫。如果有國家對台灣造成重大傷害的話，這個包括斷交，也包括一些降低非官方關係的行動，美國就應該適當的考慮降低和這個國家的接觸，在經濟、安全、外交等方面。另外當然還有繼續支持台灣的防衛，根據《台灣旅行法》鼓勵高階層的美國官員訪問台灣等等。
對台政策，妳說是不是轉向？對台政策應該是行政當局的權力，就是外交權力是行政當局的，比如說奠定美中關係的三個公報，都是美國政府和中國政府簽訂的，跟國會法律沒有關係。而使美國可以繼續保持和台灣非官方關係的，實際上我覺得更準確的說是准官方關係的，包括出售軍火，包括台灣派美國的經文處，這些實際上就是准領事館，這個是國會制定的國內法律，《台灣關係法》保證的。
但是政府政策不能跟法律對立，我認為把維持台灣邦交國和提升各個國家和台灣的非官方關係，以及提升台灣的國際地位，把它寫入美國國內法律的話，這確實是第一次，所以這是一個非常重要的步驟。
但我個人認為這還不能說是美國對台政策的正式轉向，因為他沒有改變《台灣關係法》，也沒有改變美中關係的三個公報，但這個確實是美中台關係在進行調整或者轉向過程當中的一個非常重要的步驟。
因為這個轉向我們知道從川普總統上任後不久就開始了，在這之前，另外一個立法上的重要步驟就是《台灣旅行法》，而「台北法案」應該說是更進了一步，因為它已經牽涉到其他國家對台灣的態度了，這個轉向還在發展過程當中，最終走到哪一步還很難說，但是這個大趨勢，顯然我們可以看到是很明顯的。
主持人：中共的國台辦對「台北法案」的進展順利，就參眾兩院的支持，是大為光火，「一個中國」應該是中共最不能讓人碰的底線之一，美國為什麼要這麼挑戰中共？我們看到最新的消息就是美台共同要舉行一個網絡攻防演練，在下個星期在台北舉行，很明顯就是針對北京的。
橫河：一段時間以來，中共隨著經濟實力的增強和國際影響力的上升，它不能觸碰的底線也就越來越多，它不是說底線固定在那裡的，它動輒在外交和其它的交流領域來威脅其它的國家，甚至還威脅一些公司，所以我認為一直是中共在觸碰國際社會的底線、在觸碰美國的底線。
很多時候其實別人還什麼事都沒做呢，就是某一個人在某種場合說了一句話，它馬上就跳起來上上綱上線，很多時候別的國家就要不停的去解釋，我們不是這個意思；但是你越解釋中共就越得瑟，人家一般講的是得理不饒人，中共是不得理也不饒人。
美國以前就是了，美國一直在跟中共解釋說美國不是中共的敵人，但怎麼解釋也沒有用！中共當然知道美國不把中共當作敵人，是中共要把美國當成敵人，美國是一直不明白，現在終於明白了。這是第一個，就是談到美國是不是觸碰中國底線。
從美國角度來看的話，其實他並不認為「台北法案」違反了「一中政策」。其實這裡頭也有一個，中美之間也有一個「一中各表」的意思，中共說的是「一中原則」，美國說的是「一中政策」，這兩者是有差異的，原則你不能動，但是政策是可以調整的。美國國會並不認為這個是觸碰了底線，就是通過這個法案；美國國會也不會把中共設置的底線當作是不能觸碰的，因為中共的底線會不斷的提高，也會變化。
另外一個，從性質上來說，這個法案主要還是防禦性的，它是設法阻止中共在國際上對台灣地位的貶低，是中共採用的進攻性的行為，所以這個法案是防禦性的。再一點，美國政界和學界其實已經在公開檢討美國政府過去幾十年的對華政策，最遠的已經追溯到尼克松訪華那個時候了。當然此一時彼一時，那個時候是冷戰，主要敵人是蘇聯，就很難說那個時候制訂那樣的政策錯了。
但是從今天中共崛起成為美國的主要對手，要檢討起來呢，它確實和70年代的一系列事件，以及從那個時候就開始的美國政策有關係，因為那個時候的美國對華政策一直到現在、到這兩年之前，它基本上沒有大的變化。
再一個就是形勢變了，政策本來就是可以調整的，而且也是應該調整的。美國國會它不認為它在挑戰中共，它只是在做它認為是正確的事情。至於說中共認為它自己被冒犯了、被挑釁了，那是中共的事情，國會議員不需要去考慮中共的感受，他只要對選民負責。這是它的機制，就是國會議員的職責的根據就是這樣的，他只對選民負責。
而中共的感受應該是讓行政當局去操心的。國會議員在投票的時候、在立法的時候，他不會去考慮的，要不然要政府幹什麼？這就是三權分立嘛！所以三權好處就在這個地方，立法的人不用去操心行政當局的事情。
再舉一個題外的例子，最近布拉格市，就是捷克的那個布拉格市，它決定終止和北京的姐妹城市關係，原因也很簡單，就是布拉格不接受這個姐妹城市北京在這個合同裡面的一個附加條件，這個附加條件的就是布拉格接受只有「一個中國」的這個條件，就是中華人民共和國。布拉格就拒絕了，不承認這個條件。北京非常憤怒。
這種事情我相信一直很多，就是北京在和其他國家，或者是公司，甚至城市打交道的時候，這個附加條件應該是很多的，只是說一般城市它不會拒絕，更不會公開。
但實際上你仔細想一想，這個條件是非常荒唐的。捷克作為一個國家，他承認了「一個中國」的政策的話，那麼他就是捷克和中國之間的關係了，這兩個國家政府之間的關係，他們只要保持外交承認就不影響一中政策。因為外交本來不是城市的責任，城市是沒有責任去管這種事情的，它沒有義務也不應該承擔不是自己的責任。
姐妹城市附加國家之間的這個協議是不應該的，這和布拉格的市長和他的市議會是否承認「一個中國」是沒有關係的，也許這個市長和市議會是承認的，但是他就不願意把這個作為姐妹城市的條件。
所以說事件的發生原因是北京做了不應該做的事情。北京對這個事情表示憤怒和進行懲罰就更荒唐了，就是這個布拉格城市的決定。它用的懲罰措施之一，就取消了北京和布拉格之間民航飛機的直飛，它要經過別的國家轉，這就算它懲罰了。
這個就是典型的霸權主義。人家姐妹城市應該是自願的，如果說有一方不願意，不願意就拉倒，它還要懲罰人家，人家最起碼，就是一般的普通人，人和人之間還有一個好合好散的問題嘛，它連這個都做不到。
這個例子就是來比喻，就是說其實很多事情是北京提出了不合理的條件，然後別人採取相應的對應，讓北京覺得很不高興了，其實有的時候真的是，北京的這種感受是非常奇怪的。
主持人：您剛才講到的是說美國終於認識到了中共對美國的敵意，這個情況在蓬佩奧最近的一次講話中是表達得非常清楚，他的話是這麼說的，他說，今天我們終於意識到了共產黨對美國和我們的價值觀懷有敵意的程度。那他也是繼彭斯副總統之後又一個川普團隊核心人物在中美關係上的一個表態。
橫河：對，這次表態很有意思。蓬佩奧國務卿是在哈德遜研究所講的話，就是彭斯副總統去年第一次中國政策演講的場所。他在談中國問題的時候，一開始他就說美中人民長期友好的歷史，但是中國的共產黨政府和中國人民不是一回事，他還真的說的是「中國的共產黨政府」，就是我們平常講的中共政府，他真的這麼說的。
他說到美國正面臨來自中共的挑戰，今天我們終於意識到中國共產黨真正敵視美國和我們的價值觀的程度。這句話我覺得非常有這個點睛之力呀，就作為國務卿，他說話甚至比副總統都更加直截了當，更少外交辭令。因為他是管外交的，他應該有更多的外交辭令。
他這次講話當中對中共這個本質的揭露是很多的，而且是非常全面、非常深刻的。當然他列舉了一系列的事件，這個都是我們以前詳細討論過的，今天我們就不說了。
值得注意的是他是國務卿，所謂國務卿就是負責國務院的，美國國務院呢，這個翻譯的不是太準確，他是負責外交事務的，就相當於別的國家的外交部，但是它比一般國家的外交部要高，就是在行政級別上要高，它實際上是美國行政當局最重要的部門，就這個部比其它所有的部都要高。
從性質上當然它就是外交部，但是它卻叫Department of State，為什麼呢？因為主要美國是一個世界的可以說是超級大國，冷戰結束以後幾乎是唯一的超級強國了，所以它的外交就比一般國家的外交要重要得多。
作為國務卿闡述美國的對華政策，這充分說明就是對中共的清醒的認識已經不是川普團隊某些個人，甚至是多數人的認識，而是行政當局的基本政策，就是說這個政策已經確定了。當然這麼重大的變化在實施的過程當中調整是不可避免的，但是基調已經定了。
特別有意思的是蓬佩奧在這裡表達了和彭斯同樣的意思。他說，重要的是我們和中國打交道要實際，而不是一廂情願。我們上次討論過，彭斯也講過幾乎一模一樣的話，就是用的詞稍微有一點不同而已。
主持人：對，那個可能就是反映了這個川普團隊就是一個比較務實的團隊。蓬佩奧在講話中，您剛才講到說他非常清楚的表示「中國人民」和「中國共產黨政府」是兩回事。那我們知道這個他又碰了中共的痛點，中共的駐美國大使崔天凱他馬上就在推特上去反駁他。
橫河：對，我想這個是這一屆政府的基調，就是我們最近發現很多重量級人物，就是現在美國政府的現任官員，幾乎每個重要人物講話的時候都能夠明確的去區分「中共」和「中國人民」。我們知道長期以來美國主流無論是政府官員、智庫、媒體，他談起來的時候一般都是泛指中國，他並不去認真區分中國、中國人民和中共。
我相信最早明確完整並且大力推廣這個概念區分「中共」和「中國」和「中國人民」的應該是法輪功團體，就是從《大紀元時報》系列社論《九評共產黨》和後來《解體黨文化》開始，它是最完整闡述和區分這幾個概念的，而且用各種方式向公眾用非常簡單而且容易理解和接受的形式表達出來。你比如說很簡單的就是「中共不等於中國」、「愛國不等於愛黨」等等，就這些標語在法輪功的遊行當中都有，而且在各種文章裡面都有。
中共它是非常害怕別人把「中國」和「中共」和「中國人民」這幾個概念區分開來的。中共實際上是用這個概念的混淆來綁架了中國人民。不過現在時代不一樣了，繼續欺騙已經很難了。崔天凱在這個推文裡面，妳不是提到嘛，他說：「中共是如此深的得到中國人的信任和支持，將中共和中國人區分開是對整個中國的挑戰」。結果收穫了一片罵聲！就可想就是在華人社交媒體上，絕大部分人現在早就不認同中共的這種說法。
主持人：您剛才談到這個美國主流對中共認識的轉變，我們肯定就要提到另外一個，這個人就是美國的前眾議院議長金里奇先生，他在最近的講話中就談了很多中美意識的不同。他自己說他曾經是那個擁抱熊貓派中的一員，我們就說他一直是比較親中共，那現在他徹底轉變了想法，那他也在談話中講到了他的思想轉變過程。
橫河：對，金里奇他曾經擔任過眾議院的院長，在1995年到1999年這一個時期，就是在克林頓當總統的時期。那麼我們知道這個眾議院院長實際上是美國在權力機構上面的第三號人物，總統第一號、副總統第二號，然後就是眾議院議長。
那段時間正好是美國努力全面接納中共的時間，我們知道1994年的時候，克林頓把人權和年度最惠國待遇審查脫鉤了；2001年的時候接納中共進入世貿組織，正好這段時間。金里奇他早就退下來了，但是他這個人有一點不同，就他退下以後他在政壇還是很活躍；第二個是他的思想轉變過程非常典型。
講到擁抱熊貓派，其實我個人傾向於不把這麼多人都劃歸為擁抱熊貓派。有兩種情況，就是說對中共，一種人實際上是對中共的誤解，這個包括美國整個的政策，相當一部分是誤解，就是認為，因為其他亞洲四小龍、很多國家都是在經濟發展的過程當中慢慢走向民主的，所以認為發展經濟可以走向民主；而另外一種人真的是出於利益關係，當然也可能出於意識形態方面，即使是現在認識到了還不認錯，還要繼續的為中共去當說客。
這兩種是不一樣，所以我個人更傾向於把後面這種稱作為擁抱熊貓派。而大部分人因為階段性不了解中共的本質而被中共欺騙，要把他們分開來。我個人認為金里奇應該是屬於這一類的，就是說由於時代的侷限而被中共欺騙的。就這一類人他們希望通過把中共接納到世貿組織，就可以通過經濟發展而走向民主，就是這種想法的人。因為現在大家都已經看到它走不向民主，不可能走向民主，反而向美國在輸出它的意識形態和它的價值觀。如果這個時候還繼續替中共說話的，這才是真正的擁抱熊貓派。
他最近是在推他的新書，所以講話很多，現在網上流傳，就是正式放到網上比較全的，一個是在尼克松中心的講話，一個是在南加州大學的講話，當然他還接受了「英文大紀元」和「希望之聲」的採訪，他介紹了他的新書，新書名字叫做《川普VS中國：正視美國的最大威脅》。他這裡面講到他原來相信鄧小平的白貓黑貓的說法，現在看來是錯了。他說這個中共的經濟是為了維持獨裁統治，所以這個認識很清楚，和西方想法完全不同，他們只是在耍我們。
他甚至談到習近平的頭銜，他這個認識很清楚，他說他的第一個頭銜是黨的總書記；第二個頭銜是中央軍委，而軍隊是黨的；第三個頭銜，現在人們叫president，他說他實際上不是president，他讓我們誤解為跟我們的總統一樣是選出來的。當然他舉了一些例子，就是他認識非常清楚，也談到了華為和5G、一帶一路、太空上的競爭啊，他談到中共對美國現在的威脅大於納粹德國、蘇聯，甚至當年殖民統治時的英帝國，中共的威脅都要更大。
他在南加州大學的演講當中，他特別提到了中共對宗教信仰的迫害，尤其是談到了對法輪功的迫害，他談到就是說法輪功對中共這個體制是一個致命的威脅，他說因為法輪功的第一個特徵就是教人誠實，就是真，因為法輪功教人家「真、善、忍」嘛，他第一個就是真。而對於一個極權主義國家來說的話，重要的是要聽政府的，而不是遵守誠實這個法則。
就是說他很清楚的知道中共鎮壓法輪功是因為法輪功要講真，這是他的講話裡面講到的。他說在過去十多年中共一直在追殺法輪功，包括強摘器官，就可見金裡其對這些情況是非常熟悉的，不僅僅是我們所說的了解而已。
主持人：我們再關注一下金里奇的講話，他的講話的確非常有意思，其實他除了講到中美意識形態的不同之外，他也批判了美國國內左派媒體對美國民眾的欺騙，那這個是不是也表示說美國主流現在也開始認清和反思美國社會存在的問題了呢？
橫河：金里奇在他的其中一個講話當中就談到了這次，就是伊斯蘭國的大頭目死於美國特種部隊的突襲，他重點講的是《華盛頓郵報》的一篇報導，《華盛頓郵報》對這件事情的報導的標題是非常奇怪的，它是「執掌伊斯蘭國的嚴肅宗教學者巴格達迪，死於48歲」。
這就非常奇怪了，就是說我們都知道伊斯蘭國是一個恐怖集團，恐怖主義的軍事集團，結果它把這個恐怖集團的頭目說成是「嚴肅的宗教學者」，而且它這個題目裡面閉口不提美國特種部隊的攻擊，也不提他是怎麼死亡的。
所以說你看這個題目以後，你根本就不知道它在講一件什麼事情，你不知道這件事情就是在美軍的突襲下，他後來自殺的，還把自己的三個孩子一起炸死！根本就沒有體現出來。他以這個為例來說明就是說這些媒體對美國民眾的這種欺騙。《華盛頓郵報》這篇報導的題目確實有誤導民眾之嫌，不是之嫌了，就確實是故意在誤導民眾，如果不是說它自己認同伊斯蘭國的話。
美國社會確實存在很多問題，尤其是在2016年大選以後更突出了。但是我認為川普總統當選並不是美國社會分裂的原因，而是把美國社會分裂的問題暴露出來了，就是說這個問題其實一直存在，而且越來越嚴重，但是一直被掩蓋著。
妳說是不是美國主流社會開始反思？我覺得目前承認問題和解決矛盾還沒有成為社會共識，事實上也不可能形成共識，因為民主的特徵就是不同的意見用選票來決定，來表達出來，就是說如果我不同意你我就不選你。但是民主的特徵就是君子之爭，輸了就承認，過4年再來，本來是應該這樣的。現在是這個規矩被打破了。所以美國現在我覺得更重要的是回歸傳統。
主持人：國父們的建議。
橫河：就是開創美國的那些人為美國制定的這些制度和一些基本的價值準則，基本的價值，應該回歸到那個地方去，這才是重點，就是說並不是說現在反思這些問題，反思其實要回歸傳統，回歸美國原來建國時候的價值觀。
主持人：好，那麼這次節目我們就談到這裡，感謝您的收聽，我們下次節目時間再見。
橫河：好，謝謝大家，再見。

Yokogawa: Will the US promote the ""Taipei Act"" to challenge the CCP's bottom line?

05 Nov 2019, 18:11

(This article is an interview with Yokogawa, the current affairs commentator of the United States, on the radio station of Hope. The following is a live recording.)
What does the US Senate and the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee say to the US and China through the ""Taipei Act,"" and what is the relationship between the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the three US and China Gazettes? What is the bottom line of the CCP’s question on China? What kind of US government policy and public opinion is reflected in the speeches of Secretary of State Pompeo and former Speaker Gingrich?
Moderator: Yang Guang
Guest: Yokogawa
Moderator: Listening to friends, welcome to listen to ""Yokogawa Review"", I am Yang Guang. Yokogawa: I am Yokogawa, everyone.
Moderator: In the past week, several heavyweights in the United States have spoken on Sino-US relations one after another. One is the US state affairs pro-Peo, who stressed that the United States must face the challenges of the CCP, but he is It is very clear in the speech that the CCP and the Chinese people are different. The other is Mr. Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States. He talked about the different ideologies between China and the United States. At the beginning, everyone misunderstood Deng Xiaoping’s ""black cat white cat theory"" and he gave his own concrete examples.
In this environment, the Senate and the House of Representatives’ Foreign Affairs Committee passed the ""Taipei Act"" in unison these days. Is the United States challenging the ""one China"" bottom line? How will the relationship between China, the United States and Taiwan go? We will invite Mr. Yokog to comment today.
Mr. Yokogawa, we know that the US Senate and the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the ""Taipei Act"" this week. The news regards this as a very big progress. How far do you think it will be effective?
Yokogawa: This bill was passed by the Senate on the 29th. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives was also passed on the 30th. It will then be sent to the House of Representatives for discussion and approval, and then a same version of the House and Senate will be coordinated. The president signed into law. Because the current version of the House and Senate is not much different, there will be no problem in this part. In addition, from the current international situation and the US-China relationship, the president’s signature will not be too much obstacle, so I think this bill passed. It will not take long after it officially takes effect.
Moderator: From February last year, the United States passed the ""Taiwan Travel Law,"" and since then the US-Taiwan relationship has begun to heat up. What is the content of the ""Taipei Act""? Does it mark the official turn of the US policy toward Taiwan?
Yokogawa: From the name, we can know what the contents of the ""Taipei Act"" are. The word ""Taipei Act"" comes directly from the English TAIPEI Act, which is the ""Taipei Act"". But in Taipei, TAIPEI is not Taipei, not Taipei. The meaning of this city is an abbreviation of English. This is the full text of this bill. The first letter of each word in English is exactly ""TAIPEI"". In Chinese, it is called ""2019 Taiwan International Protection and Strengthening."" The Initiative Act, that means. It is based on the ""Taiwan Relations Act"". We know that the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" is a law passed by the US Congress after the official establishment of diplomatic relations. It came into effect on January 1, 1979, and it is also a legal basis for US-Taiwan relations over the years.
The ""Taipei Act"" is mainly aimed at the diplomatic ties that the CCP has dug up many Taiwanese diplomatic countries in recent years and has blocked and dwarfed Taiwan in the world. The bill requires the US administration to take action to regularly check Taiwan’s diplomatic relations and the world. The state's policy toward Taiwan must formulate and implement corresponding countermeasures. This includes the existing diplomatic relations with Taiwan and non-state diplomatic relations. Now there are only 17 countries in the diplomatic relations.
What to check? Is it because these countries have changed the state of diplomatic relations with Taiwan, or reduced the existing informal diplomatic relations, that is, he encouraged existing diplomatic relations to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan; and encouraged non-state diplomatic relations, that is, most countries. Do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and strengthen the unofficial connection with Taiwan. If a country causes major harm to Taiwan, including break-offs, and some actions to reduce unofficial relations, the United States should properly consider reducing contact with the country in terms of economy, security, and diplomacy. In addition, of course, there is continued support for Taiwan’s defense. According to the Taiwan Travel Law, high-ranking US officials are encouraged to visit Taiwan and so on.
Is it a turn to Taiwan policy? The Taiwan policy should be the power of the executive, that is, the diplomatic power is the administrative authority. For example, the three communiqués that lay the US-China relationship are signed by the US government and the Chinese government, and have nothing to do with the law of Congress. And so that the United States can continue to maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. In fact, I think it is more accurate to say that it is a quasi-official relationship, including the sale of arms, including the Taiwanese Department of the United States, which is actually the quasi-consulate, this is the Congress. The domestic laws enacted are guaranteed by the Taiwan Relations Act.
However, government policy cannot be opposed to the law. I think it is the first time to maintain the diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the unofficial relations between various countries and Taiwan, and to enhance Taiwan’s international status and write it into US domestic law. This is a very important step.
However, I personally think that this cannot be said to be the official turn of the US policy toward Taiwan. Because he has not changed the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and has not changed the three communiques of US-China relations, but this is indeed the adjustment of US-China relations or A very important step in the steering process.
Because this turn, we know that it started shortly after President Trump took office. Before that, another important legislative step is the Taiwan Travel Law, and the ""Taipei Act"" should be said to be a step further because it already It involves the attitude of other countries towards Taiwan. This turn is still in the process of development. It is hard to say which step to go to, but this general trend is obviously obvious.
Moderator: The Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese Communist Party has made good progress on the ""Taipei Act"". The support of the Senate and the House of Representatives is very high. ""One China"" should be one of the bottom lines that the CCP can't touch. Why should the United States So challenging the CCP? The latest news we have seen is that the US and Taiwan jointly hold a network offensive and defensive drill, which will be held in Taipei next week. It is obviously aimed at Beijing.
Yokogawa: For some time, with the increase of economic strength and the rise of international influence, the CCP has more and more bottom lines that it cannot touch. It is not that the bottom line is fixed there, it is in diplomatic and other The field of communication threatens other countries and even threatens some companies, so I think it has always been the bottom line for the CCP to touch the bottom line of the international community and touch the United States.
In many cases, in fact, others have not done anything. It is that a certain person has said something on a certain occasion. It immediately jumps up and goes up the line. Many times, other countries will continue to explain. We are not this. Meaning; but the more you explain the CCP, the more you will be able to make it. People generally say that it is unreasonable. The CCP is unreasonable and unforgiving.
The United States used to be. The United States has been explaining to the CCP that the United States is not an enemy of the CCP, but it is useless to explain it! The CCP certainly knows that the United States does not regard the CCP as an enemy. It is the CCP that wants to regard the United States as an enemy. The United States has never understood it. Now it finally understands. This is the first one. It is about whether the United States touches the bottom line of China.
From the perspective of the United States, he does not think that the ""Taipei Act"" violates the ""one-China policy."" In fact, there is also a head here. There is also a meaning of ""one China and one table"" between China and the United States. The CCP says ""one China principle"" and the United States says ""one China policy"". There are differences between the two. You can't move, but the policy can be adjusted. The US Congress does not believe that this is the bottom line, that is, the passage of this bill; the US Congress will not treat the bottom line set by the CCP as untouchable, because the CCP’s bottom line will continue to improve and will change.
In addition, in nature, this bill is mainly defensive. It is trying to prevent the CCP from depreciating the status of Taiwan in the international arena. It is an offensive behavior adopted by the CCP, so this bill is defensive. Another point is that the US political and academic circles have actually publicly reviewed the US government's China policy over the past few decades. The farthest has been traced back to Nixon's visit to China. Of course, for a while, when the Cold War, the main enemy is the Soviet Union, it is difficult to say that the policy was wrong at that time.
But from the rise of the Chinese Communist Party today to becoming the main opponent of the United States, it is necessary to review it. It really has something to do with the series of events of the 1970s and the US policy that began from that time, because the US policy toward China at that time has been until now. By the end of the past two years, it has basically not changed much.
Another is that the situation has changed. The policy can be adjusted, and it should be adjusted. The US Congress does not think it is challenging the CCP. It is just doing what it thinks is the right thing. As for the CCP’s belief that it has been offended and provocative, it is a matter for the CCP. Members of Congress do not need to consider the feelings of the CCP. He is only responsible to the voters. This is its mechanism, that is, the basis for the duties of members of Congress is that he is only responsible to the voters.
The feeling of the CCP should be to let the administration worry. When a member of parliament is voting, when he is enacting legislation, he will not consider it. Otherwise, what else should the government do? This is the separation of the three powers! Therefore, the benefits of the three powers are in this place, and the people in the legislation do not have to worry about the administration.
Another example is the recent Prague city, which is the Czech city of the Czech Republic. It decided to terminate the sister city relationship with Beijing. The reason is also very simple. It is that Prague does not accept the sister city of Beijing as an additional condition in this contract. This additional condition is that Prague accepts the condition that only ""one China"" is the People's Republic of China. Prague refused and did not recognize this condition. Beijing is very angry.
I believe that this kind of thing has always been a lot. When Beijing is dealing with other countries, or companies, or even cities, this additional condition should be a lot. It just means that the average city will not refuse, and it will not be open.
But in fact, if you think about it carefully, this condition is very absurd. As a country, the Czech Republic recognizes the ""one China"" policy. Then he is the relationship between the Czech Republic and China. The relationship between the two governments, as long as they maintain diplomatic recognition, will not affect the one-China policy. Because diplomacy is not the responsibility of the city, the city has no responsibility to manage such things. It has no obligation and should not bear its own responsibility.
This agreement between sister cities and other countries is not appropriate. It does not matter whether the mayor of Prague and his city council recognize ""one China"". Perhaps the mayor and the city council recognize it, but he is not willing. Take this as a condition for a sister city.
So the reason for the incident is that Beijing did something that should not be done. It is even more ridiculous for Beijing to express anger and punishment for this matter. It is the decision of this Prague city. One of the punitive measures it used, it canceled the direct flight of the civil aircraft between Beijing and Prague. It had to be transferred by other countries, even if it was punished.
This is the typical hegemonism. People and sister cities should be voluntary. If one party is unwilling or unwilling to pull it down, it will punish others. At the very least, people are ordinary people. There is still a good problem between people and people. Well, it can't even do this.
This example is a metaphor, that is to say, in fact, many things are unreasonable conditions put forward by Beijing, and then others take corresponding correspondence, so that Beijing feels very unhappy. In fact, sometimes it is true that this feeling in Beijing is very Strange.
Moderator: What you just said is that the United States finally realized the CCP’s hostility towards the United States. This situation was very clear in a recent speech by Pompeo. His words are like this. He said, today we finally Realize the extent to which the Communist Party is hostile to the United States and our values. That is also a statement made by the core of the Trump team in the Sino-US relationship after Vice President Burns.
Yokogawa: Yes, this statement is very interesting. Secretary Pompeo’s words at the Hudson Institute are the venue for Vice President Penns’ first Chinese policy speech last year. When he talked about China's problems, he first said that the US and Chinese people have a long history of friendship. But the Chinese Communist government and the Chinese people are not the same thing. He really said ""China's Communist government"" is ours. The Chinese government, which he usually talks about, he really said so.
He said that the United States is facing challenges from the CCP. Today we finally realize the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party is truly hostile to the United States and our values. I feel very much in this sentence. As Secretary of State, he is even more straightforward and less diplomatic than the Vice President. Because he is in charge of diplomacy, he should have more diplomatic rhetoric.
The revelation of the essence of the CCP in his speech was a lot, and it was very comprehensive and very profound. Of course, he listed a series of events, which we have discussed in detail before, and we will not talk about it today.
It is worth noting that he is the Secretary of State. The so-called Secretary of State is responsible for the State Council. The US State Department does not translate this translation accurately. He is responsible for foreign affairs and is equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries, but it is more diplomatic than the general state. The Ministry is high, it is higher at the administrative level, it is actually the most important department of the US administration, and this department is higher than all other departments.
Of course, it is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it is called Department of State. Why? Because the main United States is a world that can be said to be a superpower, it is almost the only superpower after the end of the Cold War, so its diplomacy is much more important than the diplomacy of the average country.
As Secretary of State elaborates on the US policy toward China, this fully demonstrates that the sober understanding of the CCP is no longer an understanding of some individuals of the Trump team, or even the majority, but the basic policy of the administration, that is, this policy has been determined. . Of course, such a major change is inevitable in the process of implementation, but the tone has been fixed.
Of particular interest is that Pompeo expressed the same meaning as Burns here. He said that it is important that we deal with China to be practical, not wishful thinking. As we discussed last time, Burns also said almost exactly the same thing, that is, the words used are slightly different.
Moderator: Yes, that may reflect that this Trump team is a more pragmatic team. In his speech, Pompeo said that he said very clearly that the ""Chinese people"" and the ""Chinese Communist government"" are two different things. Then we know that he has touched the CCP’s pain point. Cui Tiankai, the ambassador of the CCP in the United States, immediately retorted him on Twitter.
Yokogawa: Yes, I think this is the keynote of this administration. We have recently discovered that many heavyweights are now the current officials of the US government. Almost every important person can clearly distinguish the ""CCP"" when speaking. And the ""Chinese people."" We know that for a long time, the mainstream of the United States, whether it is a government official, a think tank, or the media, he generally refers to China when he talks. He does not seriously distinguish between China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party.
I believe that the earliest clear and complete promotion of this concept to distinguish between ""CCP"" and ""China"" and ""Chinese people"" should be Falun Gong groups, from the ""Epoch Times"" series of editorials, ""Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party"" and later ""Disintegration Party Culture"" In the beginning, it is the most complete elaboration and distinction between these concepts, and is expressed in a variety of ways to the public in a form that is very simple and easy to understand and accept. For example, it is very simple that ""the CCP does not equal China"", ""patriotism does not equal love the party"", etc. These slogans are in the Falun Gong parade, and are found in various articles.
The CCP is very afraid of others to distinguish the concepts of ""China"" from the ""CCP"" and ""Chinese people."" The CCP actually used the confusion of this concept to kidnap the Chinese people. But now the times are different, it is very difficult to continue to deceive. In this tweet, Cui Tiankai did not mention it. He said: ""The CCP is so deeply trusted and supported by the Chinese that it is a challenge to the whole of China to distinguish the Chinese from the Chinese."" The result was a sizzle! It can be imagined that on the Chinese social media, most people have long disagreed with this CCP statement.
Moderator: You just talked about the transformation of the mainstream American understanding of the Chinese Communist Party. We must definitely mention another one. This person is the former Speaker of the United States, Mr. Gingrich. He talked a lot about Sino-US consciousness in his recent speech. s difference. He himself said that he used to be a member of the hugging panda faction. We said that he has always been a pro-China CCP. Now that he has completely changed his mind, he also talked about his thought transformation process in his conversation.
Yokogawa: Yes, Gingrich, who served as the president of the House of Representatives, was in the period from 1995 to 1999, when he was president of Clinton. Then we know that the Dean of the House of Representatives is actually the third person in the United States above the authority, the President No. 1, the Vice President No. 2, and then the House Speaker.
That time happened to be the time when the United States tried to fully accept the CCP. We knew that in 1994, Clinton decoupled human rights from the MFN status review. In 2001, it accepted the CCP’s entry into the WTO, just in time. Gingrich has long since retired, but he is a little different. He is still very active in politics after he retreats; the second is that his thought transformation process is very typical.
When it comes to embracing the pandas, I personally tend not to classify so many people as hugging the pandas. There are two kinds of situations, that is to say, to the CCP, a kind of person is actually a misunderstanding of the CCP. This includes a whole part of the US policy. A considerable part is misunderstanding. It is because other Asian tigers and many countries are in the process of economic development. It is slowly moving towards democracy, so that the development of the economy can go to democracy; the other kind of people are really out of interest, and of course they may also be out of ideological aspects, even if they now realize that they still do not admit their mistakes, they must continue The CCP is going to be a lobbyist.
These two are not the same, so I personally prefer to call this latter as a hug panda. Most people are deceived by the CCP because they do not understand the nature of the CCP. They must be separated. I personally think that Gingrich should belong to this category, that is to say, it was deceived by the CCP because of the limitations of the times. For this group of people, they hope that by accepting the CCP into the WTO, they can move toward democracy through economic development. Because now everyone has seen that it is not going to democracy, it is impossible to move toward democracy, but instead it is exporting its ideology and its values to the United States. If this time continues to speak for the CCP, this is the real embrace of the panda.
He recently pushed his new book, so he has a lot of speeches. Now he is circulating online, which is officially put on the Internet. One is a speech at the Nixon Center, and the other is a speech at the University of Southern California. Of course, he also accepted In an interview with ""Epoch Times"" and ""Sound of Hope"", he introduced his new book titled ""Champ VS China: Face the Biggest Threat of the United States."" He said here that he originally believed Deng Xiaoping’s white cat and black cat, and now it seems to be wrong. He said that the CCP's economy is to maintain dictatorship, so this understanding is very clear and completely different from Western ideas. They are just playing us.
He even talked about Xi Jinping's title. His understanding is very clear. He said that his first title is the party's general secretary; the second title is the Central Military Commission, and the army is the party; the third title, now called President, he said that he is actually not a president, he let us misunderstand that it is elected like our president. Of course, he gave some examples. He knows very well. He also talks about Huawei and 5G, the Belt and Road, and space competition. He said that the CCP’s current threat to the United States is greater than that of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and even the colonial rule of the year. In the British Empire, the CCP’s threat is even greater.
In his speech at the University of Southern California, he specifically mentioned the CCP’s persecution of religious beliefs, especially the persecution of Falun Gong. He talked about saying that Falun Gong is a deadly threat to the CCP system. He said that because of Falun Gong’s The first feature is to teach people to be honest, that is true, because Falun Gong teaches people to be ""truthful, kind, and bearable."" The first one is true. For a totalitarian state, it is important to listen to the government, not to the law of honesty.
That is to say, he knows very well that the CCP’s suppression of Falun Gong is because Falun Gong has to tell the truth, which is what he said in his speech. He said that in the past ten years, the CCP has been chasing Falun Gong, including the strong picking of organs. It shows that Jin Liqi is very familiar with these situations, not just what we said.
Moderator: We will pay more attention to Gingrich’s speech. His speech is indeed very interesting. In fact, apart from talking about the differences between Chinese and American ideologies, he also criticized the deception of American left-wing media to the American people. Does it also mean that the mainstream of the United States is now beginning to recognize and reflect on the problems of American society?
Yokogawa: In one of his speeches, Gingrich talked about this time, that is, the big head of the Islamic State died in a raid by US special forces. He focused on a report in the Washington Post, Washington Post. The title of the newspaper’s report on this matter is very strange. It is ""the serious religious scholar Baghdadi, who is in charge of the Islamic State, died at the age of 48.""
This is very strange. That is to say, we all know that the Islamic State is a terrorist group and a military group of terrorism. As a result, it has described the leader of this terrorist group as a ""serious religious scholar"", and it does not mention this topic. The attack by the US special forces does not mention how he died.
So after you look at this topic, you don't even know what it is talking about. You don't know that this thing was under the US military's raid. He later committed suicide and killed his three children together! It is not reflected at all. He used this as an example to illustrate the deception of these media to the American people. The title of the Washington Post report does mislead the people. It is not a suspicion. It is indeed deliberately misleading the people, if not to say that it itself agrees with the Islamic State.
There are indeed many problems in American society, especially after the 2016 general election. But I think that the election of President Trump is not the cause of the split of American society, but the problem of splitting American society. That is to say, this problem has always existed and is getting more and more serious, but it has been covered up.
Is the mainstream American society beginning to reflect? I feel that the current recognition of the problem and the resolution of the contradiction have not yet become a social consensus. In fact, it is impossible to form a consensus. The characteristic of democracy is that different opinions are decided by ballots, which means that if I disagree with you, I will not choose. you. But the characteristic of democracy is the battle of gentlemen. If you lose, you will admit that it is supposed to be like this after four years. It is now that this rule has been broken. So now the United States feels more important to return to tradition.
Moderator: The advice of the founding fathers.
Yokogawa: These are the systems and basic values that the people who created the United States have developed for the United States. The basic values should be returned to that place. This is the point, that is, it is not that we are now rethinking these issues, and the reflection is actually Return to the tradition and return to the values of the United States when it was founded.
Moderator: Ok, then we will talk about this show, thank you for listening, we will see you next time.
Yokogawa: Ok, thank you, goodbye.
