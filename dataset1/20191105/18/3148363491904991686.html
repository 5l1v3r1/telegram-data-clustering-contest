      <p>Police say the fight <a href="https://twitter.com/EvanLambertTV/status/1191528433861505024">started</a> when one man cut in front of another man and became physical, until one of the men was stabbed.</p>
      <p>Officers arrived at Popeyes to find a man suffering from multiple stab wounds. The 28-year-old man was transported to a local hospital where he died from his injuries after the stabbing, WTTG <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/man-stabbed-to-death-in-maryland-popeyes-after-altercation-over-chicken-sandwich-police-say">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Authorities are investigating and have not yet identified a suspect.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Popeyes said the chain would be cooperating with local authorities in their investigation.</p>
      <p>“We do not yet know whether this was the result of a dispute over one of our products or something unrelated, but there is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot,” a spokesperson for Popeyes <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-killed-maryland-popeyes-fight-linked-popular-chicken-sandwich-n1076351">told</a> NBC News. “Our thoughts are with the victim’s family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.”</p>
      <p>Popeyes began reselling the sandwich on Sunday after a two-month hiatus. The chain first introduced the sandwich in August, when it became so popular it sold out in two weeks and prompted a viral feud with chicken sandwich chain rival Chick-fil-A.</p>
      <p>Customers became so angry about the sandwich shortage that they resorted to acts of violence, such as the case in one Houston location where a man <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2019/09/03/police-man-pulls-gun-houston-popeyes-employees-chicken-sandwiches/">pulled</a> a gun on Popeyes employees, or <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/30/tennessee-man-sues-popeyes-for-running-out-of-chicken-sandwiches/">filed</a> a civil suit against the chain for “wasting their time.”</p>
