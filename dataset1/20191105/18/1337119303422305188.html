      <h1>Android Auto standalone app now available for Android 10 users</h1>
      <h2>But maybe not for long</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:43:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-okane" target="_blank">Sean O'Kane</a></address>
      <p>Google recently integrated Android Auto with the Android 10 operating system, removing the need for a separate app. But this meant that Android 10 users who own a car with a non-compatible head unit would no longer be able to use Android Auto just on their phone, which was possible in the past. So in September, Google promised it would release a <i>new</i> standalone Android Auto app specifically for Android 10 users, and today, that app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.projection.gearhead.phonescreen">finally hit the Play Store</a>.</p>
      <p>Bluntly named “Android Auto for Phone Screens,” the new app is only compatible with certain Android 10 devices, though it’s available on APK Mirror, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/05/google-says-itll-soon-release-a-new-android-auto-for-phone-screens-app/">as <i>AndroidPolice </i>points out</a>. It is exactly what you expect, in that it runs the full Android Auto experience on your smartphone’s screen. Simple, right?</p>
      <p>Well, the reason Google was okay with getting rid of the standalone Android Auto app in the first place was that it was supposed to be replaced by a Google Assistant “driving mode,” which the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535644/google-assistant-waze-driving-mode-shortcut-features-release-date-io-2019">company previewed earlier this year</a>. But the Google Assistant driving mode is still not available, and a spokesperson told <i>The Verge</i> on Tuesday that there’s still “no update at this time” on when it will be released.</p>
      <p>So until that happens, this new standalone app is how Android 10 users without an Android Auto-compatible head unit will get by. If and when the new Google Assistant driving mode <i>does </i>finally drop, Android Auto for Phone Screens will likely go away. As <i>The Verge’s</i> executive editor Dieter Bohn put it in September:</p>
      <blockquote>Android 10 might remove the phone interface for Android Auto, but there are some solutions to get it back. In the medium-term, Google is going to put something in the Google Play Store to bring it back. However, long-term, the plan is for Google Assistant to take over.<br/>That explains what’s happening, but it doesn’t explain<i> what is happening at Google</i>. There <i>is</i> a vision here where interacting with your phone involves having Assistant seamlessly handle apps for you so you’re not tapping when you should be driving. The upcoming Pixel 4 with its native Assistant capabilities may even come close to realizing it, too.</blockquote>
      <p>By the way, Google is <i>also</i> working on an embedded Android Automotive operating system that will start showing up in cars made by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906777/volvo-xc40-suv-ev-native-android-auto-google-assistant-maps">Volvo</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17873502/google-android-os-cars-renault-nissan-mitsubishi-alliance">Renault-Nissan</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment">General Motors</a> in the next few years, removing the need for a smartphone altogether — which, looking at the current state of things, sounds like bliss.</p>
