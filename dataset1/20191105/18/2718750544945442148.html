      <p>Only your finest uncut gems for Bong Joon-ho! The leader of the Bong Hive just revealed his preference for gems sans cuts in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/drqrii/im_bong_joon_ho_director_of_parasite_ama/">Reddit Ask Me Anything thread</a> about his new film, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/parasite-movie-review-bong-joon-hos-latest-film.html"><i>Parasite</i></a>. For those who still like their gems [*<i>ahem</i>*] cut, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/watch-adam-sandler-in-uncut-gems-trailer-2019.html"><i>Uncut Gems</i></a><i> </i>is an upcoming Safdie brothers movie starring <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/adam-sandler-joins-the-safdie-brothers-new-film-uncut-gems.html">Adam Sandler</a>, Idina Menzel, Lakeith Stanfield, and NBA star <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/kevin-garnett-in-uncut-gems-are-you-ready.html">Kevin Garnett</a>. The film isn’t out in the United States until December 13, but Bong is already proudly stanning. He told Reddit fans that, aside from <i>Parasite </i>and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/marriage-story-trailer-adam-driver-scarlett-johansson.html"><i>Marriage Story</i></a><i>,</i> by Noah Baumbach, “energetic” <i>Uncut Gems</i> is his favorite film of the year.</p>
      <p>“I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler!,” Bong replied to another Reddit question. “I really loved him in <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>, <i>The Meyerowitz Stories</i>, and <i>Uncut Gems</i>. I would love to work with him if the opportunity comes.”</p>
      <p>And with that, the Bong Hive and the <i>Uncut Gems </i>army are united! This awards season, no weapons or cut gems formed against them shall prosper.</p>
