      <h1>Hillary Clinton: U.S. Has 'Abdicated' Role as Leader of Hopeful Future</h1>
      <h2>Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton suggested on Tuesday that the United States has “abdicated” its role “as a country that leads the world toward a more hopeful future” under the Trump administration, pointing to the withdrawal of the Paris climate agreement.</h2>

      <p>The U.S. took formal steps this week to officially withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/us-tells-un-it-is-pulling-out-of-paris-climate-deal/">confirmed</a> he submitted a notice to the United Nations, signaling the U.S. withdrawal of the symbolic agreement.</p>
      <p>“In international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model — backed by a record of real world results — showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy,” Pompeo stated.</p>
      <p>Clinton, linking to a piece on the U.S. decision to leave the agreement, proclaimed that the U.S. is essentially renouncing its position “as a country that leads the world toward a more hopeful future.”</p>
      <p>“On the climate crisis and on so many other fronts, the United States has abdicated its position as a country that leads the world toward a more hopeful future,” Clinton said. “Let’s start changing that at the polls today—and a year from now in 2020”:</p>

      <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/24/promise-kept-trump-confirms-u-s-is-out-of-paris-climate-agreement/">confirmed</a> last month during an energy conference in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement as part of his “America First” agenda.</p>
      <p>“The Paris accord would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions like you would not believe, while allowing foreign producers to pollute with impunity,” Trump stated.</p>
      <p>“What we won’t do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,” he continued.</p>
      <p>The agreement is largely symbolic, filled with global platitudes. Critics have long <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/06/paris-agreement-china-india-set-easy-emissions-goals/">argued</a> that the symbolic measure gives two of the biggest polluters, China and India, what essentially amounts to a free pass.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud to say it, it’s called America First,” Trump told the Pittsburgh crowd.</p>
