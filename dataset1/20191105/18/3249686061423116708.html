      <p><b>Song Min Ho</b> apparently has one fatal flaw that his fellow members were quick to point out on the November 5 broadcast of <b>JTBC</b>'s <b>'Idol Room.'</b></p>
      <p>The group appeared on the show to promote their new song <b>"SOSO" </b>when the members voted Min Ho as the king of tardiness. <b>Kim Jin Woo</b> also accused Min Ho of eating his yogurt, eliciting laughter as well. </p>
      <p>However, Song Min Ho clarified that stealing the yogurt was a misunderstanding and relayed that he was never late to a broadcast of his reality show tapings at least, apologizing for his flaws.</p>
