      <p>Catherine Tyldesley has fallen in love with her co-star Hayley Tamaddon's new baby son Jasper - who was born after Hayley was warned for years she would never conceive.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> co-stars cosied up with little Jasper, who was born two weeks early in October, at Hayley's cosy home.</p>
      <p>Sharing a sweet picture of herself cradling the newborn, Catherine wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> : "So in love."</p>
      <p>A grateful Hayley thanked her ex <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> pal for coming over tweeting: "We had another visitor today! Auntie Cath came round! <a href="https://twitter.com/Cath_Tyldesley">@Cath_Tyldesley</a> Thankyou my love, for your kindness and friendship."</p>

      <p>Catherine replied: "Oh babe he’s just beautiful and so are you clever mummy."</p>
      <p>It came after the soap star, who played Corrie's Eva Price from 2011 to 2018, was knocked out of Strictly in a shock exit.</p>
      <p>Catherine was booted off the BBC show after she and her partner Johannes Radebe went head-to-head against Mike Bushell and Katya Jones in the dance off.</p>
      <p>And she didn't hold back and made her feelings known when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/strictlys-catherine-tyldesley-lashes-out-20741093">she liked Hayley's scathing tweet about her surprise exit</a> , which read: "Sorry but @Cath_Tyledesley did not deserve to go tonight in @bbcstrictly... she was the better dance by far..</p>
      <p>"Hold your head up high my darling Cath... you've been a joy to watch from start to finish. Big love to you and @jojo_radebe."</p>

      <p>In the week and a bit since she was voted off, Catherine has been coming to terms with her normal everyday routine.</p>
      <p>She shared a video of herself sitting in her car outside the gym, telling fans she couldn't face going inside to work out.</p>
      <p>"She's been sitting outside the gym for quite some time now trying to psyche myself up," Catherine explained.</p>
      <p>"I just think, since I finished Strictly, if I go near a gym my body's like, 'what? After weeks of that you want me to...? Ha! Nugh-uh, girlfriend. That's what my body's actually saying: no.</p>
      <p>"Failing that I might just go and have a steam room for an hour..."</p>
      <p>She returned to Instagram a little while later, saying: "It escalated fast. She's lying down. I'm going to go in in a minute, honest."</p>
