      <p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/us/chargers-new-logo/index.html">Chargers</a> moved to Los Angeles from San Diego before the 2017 NFL season.</p>
      <p>Now their owner reportedly is dismissing <a href="https://theathletic.com/1347540/2019/11/04/with-london-ready-for-an-nfl-team-the-chargers-have-been-discussed-as-a-possible-option/">a story on The Athletic</a> that says they might be on the move again -- to London.</p>
      <p>Dean Spanos told a Los Angeles Times reporter the report is "a lot of crap."</p>
      <p>"We're playing in LA. This is our home, and this where we're planning to be for a long (expletive) time. Period. OK? If you want me to say it again, I'll say it again. (expletive) (expletive) that story. OK? Thank you," the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeDiGiovanna/status/1191811708420907008">LA Times reporter tweeted</a> Spanos as saying.</p>
      <p>The team on its social media accounts included a video showing Leonardo DiCaprio's character in "The Wolf of Wall Street" telling a room full of brokers that "I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving."</p>
      <p>He adds after some profanity, "The show goes on."</p>
      <p>The Athletic reported "through NFL sources that the possibility of the Chargers moving to London has been broached among league personnel.</p>
      <p>"The Athletic also has learned that, while the team is fully committed to Los Angeles where it will move into the new $4.5 billion stadium with the Rams next year, the Chargers would at least listen if the NFL approached them about London as a possible option."</p>
      <p>The story says NFL owners would support a move to London if the Chargers, the less popular of the two NFL teams in the city, want to relocate.</p>
      <p>The report included a quote from Spanos, who says the team is committed to Los Angeles.</p>
