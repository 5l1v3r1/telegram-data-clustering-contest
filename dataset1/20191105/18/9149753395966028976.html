      <h1>Phanteks renames Luxe 2 case to avoid confusion with Thermaltake’s mobile brand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:09:31+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>If you are on the hunt for an Enthoo Luxe 2 <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-case/">PC case</a> from Phanteks, be advised that the name has changed. It's now listed as the Enthoo 719. Phanteks made the name change to appease Thermaltake, who apparently felt the Luxe 2 could be confused with its Luxa 2 (stylized as "LUXA2") brand.</p>
      <p>I wasn't even aware that a Luxa 2 brand existed. A quick web search reveals it's Thermaltake's mobile accessories brand, and that I've missed its presence for a decade (it was founded in 2009). It's actually a fairly extensive lineup, consisting of charging cables, phone cases, car mounts for smartphones, and a bunch of other stuff.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/260818/phanteks-renames-enthoo-luxe-2-to-enthoo-719">TechPowerUp</a>, Phanteks received a letter from Thermaltake about its Luxe 2 case being too similar to its Luxa 2 brand. Even though Phanteks "strongly disagrees," it decided a name change this was too silly to squabble over, and renamed its case.</p>
      <p>"We would like to move on and spend less time on this matter and concentrate more on creating innovating products for our users. Thank you for understanding," Phanteks said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Other than the name, the Enthoo 719 is the exact same case as the Luxe 2—no physical changes have been made. Since there was no Luxe 2 branding on the case itself, it's not likely vendors will look to unload inventory when <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> roll into view. Instead, product listings have been updated to reflect the new name, even when using an old URL (<a href="https://www.newegg.com/satin-black-phanteks-enthoo-luxe-2-full-tower/p/N82E16811854088">as is the case at Newegg</a>).</p>
      <p>There is a bit of irony in all this, in that a few years ago <a href="https://www.legitreviews.com/thermaltake-accused-of-stealing-new-computex-products-went-too-far_165153">Legit Reviews</a> posted a comparison of several Thermaltake products with very similar designs to the competition. That's fairly common in the PC sector, but also fair game to bring up in these situations.</p>
