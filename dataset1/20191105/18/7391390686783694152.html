      <p>I've always been more of a "glass half-empty" type of person. That's not to say that I walk around with a scowl on my face — but more often than not, I wake up on the wrong side of the bed. What can I say? I'm not a morning person either. But when it comes to looking at all the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/52-awesome-products-on-amazon-with-thousands-of-reviews-that-are-selling-out-7491315">shockingly cool products available on Amazon</a>, there isn't a thing in the world that could turn this smile into a frown.</p>
      <p>But it's not enough to just be cool If you're really trying to get my blood pumping, it also has to be useful, and <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/68-shockingly-useful-gadgets-under-20-on-amazon-17015329">ideally under $20</a>. Sure, I enjoy a good throw pillow the same as the next person, but it's nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the blackout curtains I've included in this list are not only wrinkle-free, but they even help insulate your home so you save money on utilities — meaning <i>that</i> is something worth its cost in postage. Along with the Bluetooth headphones that can run for up to 18 hours and the whitening pen that gets your teeth up to eight shades whiter, of course.</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/you-can-organize-so-much-crap-with-any-of-these-40-genius-things-from-amazon-17042610">kitchen storage solutions</a> that are shockingly clever, or just a fun impulse-buy that won't break the bank, there are tons of items on Amazon to choose from.</p>
      <h3>1. The Blackout Curtains That Help Save You Money On Utilities</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Not only do they completely block out any outside light so that you can sleep easier, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CS31NV6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19294728-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B01CS31NV6">these blackout curtains</a> are also thermally-insulated, which helps keep out the summer heat or wintertime cold. They're wrinkle-free, plus each order comes with two panels. They're available in too many colors to list here, and the grommet top allows them to easily glide back and forth without any snagging.</p>
