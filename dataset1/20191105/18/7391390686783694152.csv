What's Under $20 & Legitimately Awesome? These 37 Things On Amazon

05 Nov 2019, 18:27

I've always been more of a ""glass half-empty"" type of person. That's not to say that I walk around with a scowl on my face — but more often than not, I wake up on the wrong side of the bed. What can I say? I'm not a morning person either. But when it comes to looking at all the shockingly cool products available on Amazon, there isn't a thing in the world that could turn this smile into a frown.
But it's not enough to just be cool If you're really trying to get my blood pumping, it also has to be useful, and ideally under $20. Sure, I enjoy a good throw pillow the same as the next person, but it's nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the blackout curtains I've included in this list are not only wrinkle-free, but they even help insulate your home so you save money on utilities — meaning that is something worth its cost in postage. Along with the Bluetooth headphones that can run for up to 18 hours and the whitening pen that gets your teeth up to eight shades whiter, of course.
Whether you're looking for kitchen storage solutions that are shockingly clever, or just a fun impulse-buy that won't break the bank, there are tons of items on Amazon to choose from.
1. The Blackout Curtains That Help Save You Money On Utilities




NICETOWN Blackout Curtains$22|AmazonSee On Amazon

Not only do they completely block out any outside light so that you can sleep easier, but these blackout curtains are also thermally-insulated, which helps keep out the summer heat or wintertime cold. They're wrinkle-free, plus each order comes with two panels. They're available in too many colors to list here, and the grommet top allows them to easily glide back and forth without any snagging.
2. A Pack Of Hair Towels Made From Super-Plush Microfiber




Duomishu Hair Towel Wrap (2-Pack)$10|AmazonSee On Amazon

Not only does the microfiber used to make these hair towel wraps feel incredibly soft on your skin, but it's also able to absorb more water than cotton, which means they can also help your hair dry faster. Allowing your hair to dry naturally by using these towels is a great way to avoid breakage or frizz, too. This two-pack is great — throw one in the washing machine while you're using the other one.
3. The Bluetooth Headphones With An 18-Hour Battery




Mpow Bluetooth Headphones$20|AmazonSee On Amazon

If AirPods aren't your jam but you still want to go wireless — why not try an over-the-ear option like these Bluetooth headphones? The battery can last for up to 18 hours when fully charged, and in the event it dies, there's also a port where you can plug in an audio cable to keep the music going. Each order also comes with a bag, and the built-in microphone lets you answer calls without using your hands.

The battery is rechargeable so you won't have to worry about buying replacements, plus you can even use it to shrink your pores.
6. A Dish Drying Rack That Collapses Down For Easy Storage




PREPWORKS Over-The-Sink Dish Drainer$18|AmazonSee On Amazon

Able to hold eight plates as well as multiple utensils and silverware, this dish drying rack sets itself apart from the competition by fitting overtop your sink so that you'll never have to clean another drip board.

7. The Gym Bag That's Large Enough To Be An Airplane Carry-On
