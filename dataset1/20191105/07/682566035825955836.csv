Boardroom fights, clashing egos - How things unravelled for Benni McCarthy at CT City


McCarthy was sacked on Monday - after continuing a horrid spell into the 2019/2020 campaign that saw his side languishing in 13th position on the log - having managed just two wins from their last 18 games.
Just a few hours after the announcement of McCarthy's sacking, Ertugral posted an Instagram story showing that he was back in Cape Town.
Sport24 revealed that the former head coach of Mpumalanga Black Aces - the team that later became Cape Town City - was the favourite to take over at CT City.
The 60-year-old is believed to enjoy an excellent relationship with City boss John Comitis and is likely to return to the club that he helped established by leading Aces to 7th position in the 2013/2014 Absa Premiership campaign.
Ertugral will be aiming to reignite his managerial career after unsuccessful spells at Ajax Cape Town - who were relegated to the NFD - and Maritzburg United.
