有「蛋糕界奧斯卡」美譽的英國「國際蛋糕節」（Cake International）於3日落幕，期間出現以香港反送為主題的參賽蛋糕，遭中國參賽者聯合舉報「港毒（獨）」，而被撤銷參賽資格，引發各界譁然。主辦單位事後透過官方臉書澄清之所以下架反送中蛋糕是因為「尺寸太大」，卻遭網友狠打臉。
「國際蛋糕節」臉書表示，有評論說蛋糕之所以被取消資格，是因為其遭投訴內容有威脅性，官方對此做出澄清。「國際蛋糕節」強調整個比賽的評分是依據蛋糕的裝飾技巧而非主題，不幸的遭下架的蛋糕並不符合規定「展示部分不得超出允許範圍。尺寸過大的展品將會被取消資格。」從「國際蛋糕節」po出的照片看來，蛋糕底座的雨傘裝飾，超出了底座的範圍。

「國際蛋糕節」重申，這個比賽是包容性的社群，歡迎來自全世界的參賽者，這個被下架的參賽者並非因為政治宣稱，而是不符合規定，超出原本比賽規則。「國際蛋糕節」稱瞭解情況很敏感，以及世界有許多熱烈的觀點，但強調做出決定是單純基於對蛋糕裝飾的最有利的因素，而非信念或意見的宣言。
不過，「國際蛋糕節」官方的這番聲明，網友顯然不買單，這起聲明貼文迄今獲得6,073個讚／表情，其中有5,769個都是憤怒生氣表情，呈現壓倒性的不滿意見，底下網友po出遭下架的香港甜點店收到「國際蛋糕節」來函通知下架的內容，狠狠打臉尺寸太大的說法，上頭明白寫著決定下架蛋糕因為「背後的內容和信息被視為是冒犯的，引來其他參賽者的抱怨」。

The British ""Cake International"", which has the reputation of ""Oscar in the Cake Industry"", was on the 3rd sunset. During the period, the cakes with the theme of Hong Kong's reverse delivery appeared. The Chinese participants jointly reported ""Hong Kong Poison (Independent)"". The disqualification of the competition has caused a lot of sorrow. After the organizer clarified through the official Facebook, the following cakes were sent back because the ""size is too big"", but the netizens beat their faces.
The ""International Cake Festival"" Facebook said that some people said that the reason why the cake was disqualified was because the content of the complaint was threatening, and the official clarified it. The ""International Cake Festival"" emphasizes that the overall competition is based on the decoration skills of the cake rather than the theme. Unfortunately, the cake that has been removed from the shelves does not meet the requirements. ""The display part must not exceed the allowable range. Excessively large exhibits will be disqualified."" From the photos of the ""International Cake Festival"" po, it seems that the umbrella decoration of the cake base is beyond the scope of the base.
