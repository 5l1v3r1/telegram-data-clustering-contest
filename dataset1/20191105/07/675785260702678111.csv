Katie Price admitted she struggles to keep her kids in order.
The mother-of-five, 41, confessed she has never been the ""boss"" of her children in a candid Instagram video uploaded on the social media site on Monday.
In the clip, the former glamour model asked if her two youngest Jett and Bunny were going to be well behaved for the day they spent with her.
Jett had no qualms sharing his plans he was going to be naughty with a shake of his head.
Bunny, however, claimed she was going to be good for her mum - much to Katie's surprise.
