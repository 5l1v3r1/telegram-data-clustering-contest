      <p>A huge lorry fire shut down large parts of the M6 motorway in both directions this morning causing miles of tailbacks.</p>
      <p>Fire fighters were called to the fire which took hold between junction 2, Coventry, and junction 1, Rugby, at around 3am this morning.</p>
      <p>Great clouds of smoke filled the air and severely reduced visibility on the motorway.</p>
      <p>Diverted were diverted away from the fire, which caused both north and southbound parts of the road to shut,</p>
