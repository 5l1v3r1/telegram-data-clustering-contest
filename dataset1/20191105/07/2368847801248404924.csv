【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】【江峰時刻】「四中全會」落幕，《香港人權與民主法案》能拖多久？區塊鏈 – 末日戰略的體現（江峰漫談20191104第59期）
上個月十五號，美國眾議院通過了《香港人權與民主法案》，為什麼美國參議院遲滯香港人權法案？
10月31日，「四中全會」落幕，從公報來看，中共對於觸動其執政的核心問題，均不退讓。中共近期對美實際是假讓步，以換取恢復其經濟的時間。包括臨時貿易協議，中共在以錢買時間，換取經濟調整期，以拖待變。
這些國家戰略，本質就是能拖一天是一天，包括那個區塊鏈，都是這種末日戰略的體現。

[Jiangfeng Moment] The ""Four Plenary Session"" ended, how long can the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy last? Blockchain – the embodiment of the doomsday strategy

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] [Jiangfeng moment] ""The Fourth Plenary Session"" ended, how long can the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy last? Blockchain – the embodiment of the doomsday strategy (Jiangfeng Tan 20191104, Issue 59)
On the 15th of last month, the US House of Representatives passed the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on Human Rights and Democracy. Why did the US Senate delay the Hong Kong Bill of Rights?
On October 31, the ""fourth plenary session"" ended. From the communique, the CCP did not give up on the core issues that touched its ruling. The CCP’s recent actual concession to the United States is in exchange for the time to restore its economy. Including the temporary trade agreement, the CCP is buying time with money in exchange for an economic adjustment period to delay the change.
The essence of these national strategies is that one day is one day, including the blockchain, which is the embodiment of this doomsday strategy.
