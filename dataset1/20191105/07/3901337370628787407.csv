Will Malepe facing suspension as a result of the sending off in his side’s loss to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout quarter-final, the player is now able to join the U23s earlier than planned.

The three top teams from the competition in Egypt will represent Africa at the 2010 Tokyo Olympic Games.
