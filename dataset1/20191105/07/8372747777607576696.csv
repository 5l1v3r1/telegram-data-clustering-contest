LEE COUNTY, Fla. – Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will be in Southwest Florida on Tuesday.
The governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis will be at Lover's Key State Park at noon.
They're scheduled to make an announcement with state environmental and health leaders.
They will be joined by Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein, State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees, and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Executive Director Eric Sutton.
Earlier Tuesday, Gov. DeSantis was in Martin County to announce the launching of a new online resource that will allow the public to find out current water quality numbers and projects. The site, Protect Florida Together , is billed as a “one stop shop” multi-agency tool for transparency in the state’s effort to improve its water quality.
