      <h2>The Reds welcome Belgian opposition to Anfield for their latest Champions League Group E clash on Tuesday</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are back in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> action after their dramatic comeback at Villa Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Following Sadio Mane’s stoppage-time winner against Aston Villa, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp’s</a> attention turns to matchday four of the UEFA Champions League as his Liverpool side take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/genk">Genk</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The cup holders bagged four in Belgium in the reverse fixture as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain netted a brace, with his second goal the pick of the bunch - an outside-of-the-boot finish from the edge of the area that was described by Klopp as "spectacular".</p>
      <p>Liverpool currently lie 2nd in Group E, behind Napoli, the only side to have beaten the Reds in all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>Here is all the key information you need to know ahead of the game…</p>

      <h3>Liverpool team news</h3>
      <p>There are no fresh injury concerns for Jurgen Klopp with all his players coming through the Aston Villa game unscathed.</p>
      <p>The only absentees are Joel Matip, Xherdan Shaqiri and Nathaniel Clyne, who are all suffering from long-term injuries.</p>
      <h3>Genk team news</h3>
      <p>Genk will have to do without first-choice goalkeeper Danny Vukovic who is ruled out due to an Achilles tendon injury. Gaetan Coucke would be the natural choice to fill in between the sticks.</p>
      <p>It’s expected manager Felice Mazzu will welcome back Mbwana Samatta into the starting eleven after he was benched against KAS Eupen at the weekend.</p>
