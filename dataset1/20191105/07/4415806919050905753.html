      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told “so many lies” during the Brexit campaign, the outgoing president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has claimed.</p>
      <p>Mr Juncker, whose term at the helm of the European executive will come to an end by January 2020, also said he had been “firmly convinced” the referendum “would go wrong”.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister of Luxembourg, speaking to German magazine Der Speigel, said he made a £1 gain from the Leave vote in 2016.</p>
      <p>He told the publication: “I was one of those early on who was firmly convinced that this referendum would go wrong.</p>
      <p>“When then-prime minister David Cameron told me on the sidelines of the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane that he really wanted to hold a Brexit referendum, I told him ‘You’re going to lose it.’</p>
      <p>“I made a bet with the European commissioner of British nationality at the time, Jonathan Hill: I get a pound from you if the Remainers lose, you get a euro if you win.</p>
      <p>“I have that pound today.”</p>
      <p>Britain’s departure from the European Union was initially due to take place on March 29 this year, but was later postponed to May 22, and then October 31.</p>
      <p>A so-called flextension has been granted until January 31 and, since then, a General Election has been called for December 12 where Brexit is expected to be a key issue.</p>
      <p>Mr Juncker was asked by Der Speigel about why he opted not to fight for a Remain vote and said he had received “many invitations” to campaign.</p>
      <p>He said: “Cameron made it clear that he didn’t have any use for me.</p>
      <p>“The European Commission is even less popular in Britain than it is on the Continent. I decided not to get involved.</p>
      <p>“Looking at it today, I think that was a big mistake. So many lies were told, including by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them.”</p>
