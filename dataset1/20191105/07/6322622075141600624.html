      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): Malaysia is working to locate at least US$4.3 billion in assets that have yet to be accounted for in a global money laundering probe into state fund 1MDB, its anti-corruption chief said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>U.S. authorities say about US$4.5 billion was siphoned from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in a scandal spanning several countries but Malaysian officials say much more was stolen.</p>
      <p>The United States struck a deal last week to recover about US$700 million more from fugitive financier Jho Low, who has played a central role in the scandal. He had previously forfeited a US$126 million yacht and US$140 million in other assets.</p>
      <p>But about 18 billion ringgit (US$4.34 billion) in assets remain unidentified and Malaysia was working with at least five countries to recover the amount, Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysiaâ€™s Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters.</p>
      <p>"This what we're working on... to locate, investigate and research where these properties are," Latheefa said.</p>
      <p>She declined to give further details on the assets sought or the countries involved, citing pending investigations.</p>
      <p>At least six countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB, founded by former prime minister Najib Razak.</p>
      <p>Najib, who lost a general election last year, has since been charged with 42 criminal offences related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities.</p>
      <p>He has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers say he was misled by high-ranked officials at the fund.</p>
      <p>Malaysia estimates Low stole more than US$10 billion from 1MDB, attorney-general Tommy Thomas told the Nikkei Asian Review last month.</p>
      <p>Low, who faces charges in Malaysia and the United States over the scandal, has consistently denied wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown.</p>
