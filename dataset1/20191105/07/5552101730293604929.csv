【現場直擊】藝術是一種感覺！AUDEMARS PIGUET X 池田亮司「製錶之外」東京藝術展
05 Nov 2019, 07:09 by 陳哲民 Jamie Chen
在製錶之外，還可以有什麼？ 愛彼（AUDEMARS PIGUET）給我們的答案是：藝術。然而，愛彼所謂的藝術也非比尋常。日前在東京六本木舉行的Beyond Watchmaking「製錶之外」藝術展，他們與日本前衛藝術家池田亮司合作，帶領參觀者進入一場聲音、視覺、全感官的奇幻體驗！在進入這個展場之前，我從來沒有想過一個傳統頂級製錶工藝的錶展，竟可以變身為當代前衛藝術館？而愛彼結合了二者，全然沒有違和。
這或許也就是愛彼之所以是愛彼的原因吧！


AP愛彼在東京六本木Midtown「芝生廣場」的草地上，憑空搭建起一座巨型展覽館，現場除了展出橫跨一百四十四年的品牌歷史與製錶工藝，也展出藝術家池田亮司的最新作品。

看完池田亮司裝置在愛彼藝術展現場的巨幅投影作品，我恍恍惚惚，整個人沉浸在有如被拋進宇宙漂流的無方向知覺之中，突然有人問：「看不懂耶，怎麼辦？」
「啊？藝術是一種感覺，不需要看懂的。」我直覺地這樣回答。
但回頭再想，愛彼竟膽敢裝置一個讓人看不懂的藝術作品在他們錶展現場，這等勇氣，讓我對其品牌格局，又更加佩服了。


池田亮司（Ryoji Ikeda，1966年出生於日本岐阜縣）是少數同時以視覺及聲音創作聞名國際的藝術家。其創作涉及數學、量子力學、哲學、混和聲響、音樂、影像。在成為藝術家之前，他還是一個電子音樂DJ，因此他以作曲家方式思考創作，將聲音、燈光、空間、時間等物理現象一一納為其編寫作品的元素之中。愛彼在東京六本木Midtown的Beyond Watchmaking藝術展雖然已經結束。但在台北市立美術館舉行的「池田亮司個展」，目前則仍在舉行中（展期至2019年11月17日），飛不了東京，在台北也有一睹這位藝術家作品的機會。

一般認為，藝術欣賞的功能之一，是可以啟發思考。每個人都可以投射感受於作品中，把自己的經歷置入，進行個人詮釋。因此，欣賞藝術，真的沒有什麼懂或不懂的問題。只不過，以目前時尚精品界「結合藝術做行銷」的趨勢來看，品牌大多還是選擇「淺顯易懂」的藝術家進行合作，例如村上隆、空山基、KAWS等等。比較安全、好懂，同時在收藏市場上也有炒作空間。因此，我必須要在此用力稱讚：AP愛彼，你們真有種，夠厲害。
日前，愛彼在東京六本木Midtown憑空搭建起一座巨型展覽館，現場除了展出橫跨一百四十四年的品牌歷史與製錶工藝，最重要焦點，就是藝術家池田亮司的三部曲作品data-verse，今年五月在「威尼斯雙年展」公開第一部分之後，即在此發表了第二個變體。



其實，池田亮司的作品既好懂也不好懂。他的作品結合視覺與聽覺，非常感官，只要看得見聽得到，就能感覺到他所傳達的意象。但另一方面，借用「台北市立美術館」目前正舉行中的池田亮司個展上的宣傳文字上所寫：「池田亮司透過可靠的數學語言建構他個人的理念，具體而微提供一個有界無限的宇宙時空圖像。」這段文字，足以說明這位藝術家有其「形而上」極難以捕捉的部分。
因此，AP愛彼與他之間的合作，絕非只是單一場次的譁眾取寵。事實上，愛彼與他的合作跨及整個data-verse三部曲以及微型作品data anatomy [for Audemars Piguet]的發表，是至少二年的長期合作關係。


愛彼今年發表的CODE 11.59系列錶款，結合了傳統與創新，最足以說明愛彼製錶的前衛精神，同時也是Beyond Watchmaking藝術展的主角之一。

為此，愛彼董事會主席Jasmine Audemars給了答案。
「我們從2013年的Art Basel（巴塞爾藝術展）開始跟當代藝術家合作，每次的作品，都讓人開啟新的視野，讓你對世界有不一樣的解讀，所以愛彼很喜歡跟藝術家合作，並邀請他們到品牌的發源地汝拉山谷，也就是愛彼總部的所在地，透過藝術家以品牌發源地為發想，去創作引人入勝的當代作品。」
「我們有悠久歷史，由創始家族經營至今，維持獨立製錶。我們可以找到自己的做事方式，不用像上市公司每年需要發布財務季報。這對我們來說既是挑戰，也是最令人著迷的地方。」她說：「雖然愛彼有悠久的歷史。但傳統與創新息息相關，傳統幫助我們思考創新，幫助我們發揮創造力，我們絕不能陷入傳統，傳統也絕對不是座監獄，反之，它可以幫助你發揮創造力，要有創造力就要反覆問自己問題：我們已完成了嗎？我們還可以用其他方式做嗎？」


展覽空間由設計師Mathieu Lehanneur打造，以繞著汝拉山谷岩石的環形空間，展出12個製錶主題。

愛彼此次在東京舉行的Beyond Watchmaking「製錶之外」藝術展，就是愛彼不斷問自己「我們還可以做什麼？」的一項成果。這個展，是製錶工藝與藝術之間的對話。設計師Mathieu Lehanneur 將展示空間設計成一隻銅環，圍繞著由汝拉山谷 （Vallée de Joux）打造的復刻岩石，與愛彼的地理起源遙相呼應。其周圍則設置了 12 道門，分別展示品牌一路以來的關鍵製錶技術與設計成果里程碑。而發想自錶盤的圓形空間，從參觀者踏入愛彼歷史的那一剎那起，即活靈活現地環繞著整個空間。


展覽現場結合攝影師Dan Holdsworth於汝拉山谷拍攝的自然景色，以及Mathieu Lehanneur設計的展場裝置展出的鐘錶工藝零件，讓人走入愛彼的製錶核心。

12 個展區裡，分別展示超過 150 隻經典與現代的愛彼收藏錶款，囊括了卓越的前衛設計，與製錶廠所研發的高度專業構造 ─ 從計時碼錶到 Grandes Complications，乃至於罕見的鐘鳴設計與天文機制。此次也特別展出在 1875 年由製錶廠聯合創辦人之一的 Jules Louis Audemars 落實空前鐘錶複雜度的曠世巨作，相關展品正是他當年學徒生涯結業的代表作。
除此之外，參觀者也能親身體驗愛彼製錶師們所鍾愛的，各種既傳統又創新的技術。布拉蘇絲(Le Brassus) 的專家們，也將演繹從製錶廠成立以來，用來裝飾愛彼鐘錶的精工技術，並向參觀者們介紹愛彼 Code 11.59 極盡專業能事的主要技術巧思。

所以，藝術不僅是產品行銷的一部分，同時也是創新的一部分。想要為自己開啟全新的視野，學學愛彼，去看一場不好懂的藝術展吧！

[On-the-spot direct] Art is a feeling! AUDEMARS PIGUET X Ikeda Shinji ""Outside the Table"" Tokyo Art Exhibition
05 Nov 2019, 07:09 by Chen Zhemin Jamie Chen
What else can you have outside of watchmaking? The answer given to us by AUDEMARS PIGUET is: art. However, Audemars Piguet's so-called art is also extraordinary. Beyond Watchmaking, a ""out of watch"" art exhibition held in Roppongi, Tokyo, recently collaborated with Japanese avant-garde artist Ikeda Seiji to lead visitors into a fantasy experience of sound, vision and full sense! Before entering this exhibition, I never thought about the exhibition of a traditional top watchmaking process, which can be transformed into a contemporary avant-garde art gallery? And Audemars Piguet combines the two, there is no violation.
This may be the reason why Audemars Piguet is Audemars Piguet!


AP Audemars Piguet set up a giant exhibition hall on the grass in Midtown ""Mitsubishi Plaza"" in Roppongi, Tokyo. In addition to exhibiting brand history and watchmaking craft spanning 144 years, the exhibition also exhibited the artist Ikeda. Latest works.

After reading the huge projections of Ikeda’s installation at the Audemars Piguet exhibition, I sighed that the whole person was immersed in the non-directional consciousness that was thrown into the universe, and suddenly someone asked, “I don’t understand yeah, how? do?""
""Ah? Art is a feeling that you don't need to understand."" I responded intuitively.
But looking back, Audemars Piguet dared to install a work of art that people could not understand at their exhibition site. This courage made me more admired for its brand structure.


Ryoji Ikeda (born in Gifu Prefecture, Japan in 1966) is one of the few artists who are internationally renowned for their visual and sound creations. His creations involve mathematics, quantum mechanics, philosophy, mixed sounds, music, and images. Before becoming an artist, he was still an electronic music DJ, so he thought about creation in a composer's way, and included physical phenomena such as sound, lighting, space, and time into the elements of his work. Audemars Piguet's Beyond Watchmaking art exhibition in Midtown, Tokyo has ended. However, the ""Ikeda Shinji Solo Exhibition"" held at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum is still in progress (expanded until November 17, 2019). It cannot fly to Tokyo, and there is also an opportunity for the artist to work in Taipei.

It is generally believed that one of the functions of art appreciation is to inspire thinking. Everyone can project and feel in the works, put their own experiences into personal interpretation. Therefore, there is really no question of understanding or understanding the art. However, in view of the trend of the current fashion boutique industry ""combining art with marketing"", most of the brands choose to cooperate with artists who are ""easy to understand"", such as Murakami, Kongsanji, KAWS and so on. It is safer and more understandable, and there is also room for speculation in the collection market. Therefore, I must praise it here: AP Audemars Piguet, you are really kind, very powerful.
A few days ago, Audemars Piguet built a giant exhibition hall in Midtown, Tokyo, in addition to exhibiting brand history and watchmaking technology spanning 144 years. The most important focus is the trilogy of artist Ikeda. -verse, after the first part of the ""Venice Biennale"" was released in May this year, the second variant was published here.



In fact, Ikeda’s work is both easy to understand and difficult to understand. His work combines vision and hearing, and is very sensible. As long as he can see it, he can feel the image he conveys. On the other hand, borrowing from the propaganda text of the ""Taipei Museum of Fine Arts"", which is currently being held in the Ikeda's solo exhibition, ""Ikeda Akira builds his personal ideas through reliable mathematical language, and provides a boundless and infinite universe of time and space. The image."" This text is enough to show that the artist has a ""metaphysical"" part that is extremely difficult to capture.
Therefore, the cooperation between AP Audemars Piguet and him is not just a slap in the face of a single event. In fact, the cooperation between Audemars Piguet and his entire data-verse trilogy and the micro-data anatomy [for Audemars Piguet] is a long-term relationship of at least two years.


Audemars Piguet's CODE 11.59 series, which combines tradition and innovation, best describes the avant-garde spirit of Audemars Piguet and is one of the protagonists of Beyond Watchmaking.

To this end, Audemars Piguet Chairman Jasmine Audemars gave the answer.
""We started working with contemporary artists from Art Basel in 2013. Every time, the works open up new horizons and let you have a different interpretation of the world, so Audemars Piguet likes artists. Collaborate and invite them to the birthplace of the brand, the Jura Valley, where the Audemars Piguet headquarters is located, to create fascinating contemporary works through the artist's origins.
""We have a long history, from the founding family to the present, to maintain independent watchmaking. We can find our own way of doing things, not like the listed company needs to publish the financial quarterly report every year. This is both a challenge and the most fascinating place for us. She said: ""Although Audemars Piguet has a long history, tradition and innovation are closely related. Tradition helps us to think about innovation and help us to be creative. We must not fall into tradition. Tradition is definitely not a prison. On the contrary, it can help. If you are creative, you have to be creative. You have to ask yourself questions: Have we finished? Can we do it in other ways?""


The exhibition space was created by designer Mathieu Lehanneur to display 12 watchmaking themes around the annulus of the rocky valley of the Jura Valley.

Love Beyond Watchmaking, which is held in Tokyo next time, is a result of Audemars Piguet asking himself ""What else can we do?"" This exhibition is a dialogue between watchmaking crafts and art. Designer Mathieu Lehanneur designed the exhibition space into a copper ring that revolves around the replicat rock created by the Vallée de Joux, echoing Aegis' geographical origin. There are 12 doors around it, showing the key watchmaking techniques and design milestones since the brand. The circular space from the dial, from the moment the visitors step into the history of Audemars Piguet, is alive and well around the space.


The exhibition combines the natural scenery of the photographer Dan Holdsworth in the Jura Valley, as well as the watchwork components exhibited by Mathieu Lehanneur's exhibition installations, allowing people to enter Audemars Piguet's watchmaking core.

In 12 exhibition areas, more than 150 classic and modern Audemars Piguet collections, including outstanding avant-garde designs and highly specialized structures developed by watchmakers – from chronographs to Grandes Complications, to rare Zhong Ming design and astronomical mechanism. This time, I also exhibited Jules Louis Audemars, one of the co-founders of watchmakers, in 1875 to implement the masterpieces of the unprecedented complexity of watches and clocks. The related exhibits are the masterpieces of his apprenticeship.
In addition, visitors can experience the traditional and innovative technologies that Audemars Piguet watchers love. Experts from Le Brassus will also introduce the fine technology used to decorate Audemars Piguet watches since the establishment of the watchmaking factory, and introduce the main technology of Audemars Piguet Code 11.59 to the visitors. Ingenious.

Therefore, art is not only part of product marketing, but also part of innovation. I want to open up a new horizon for myself, learn to love Aude, and go to see an art exhibition that I don't understand!
