      <p>SEOUL — A member of South Korean <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/bts-band/">boy band</a><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/bts-band/"> BTS</a> is being investigated by police after admitting he was at fault in a crash between a car he was driving and a taxi, the group’s management said.</p>
      <p>Jungkook, the group’s main vocalist, was driving in central Seoul last week when he hit a taxi due to an “an error on his part,” manager Big Hit Entertainment said on Monday. The 22-year-old immediately admitted violating traffic laws and was questioned by police.</p>

      <p>“Both the victim and Jung Kook did not sustain major injuries,” Big Hit said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“He made a statement at the police department and reached an amicable settlement with the victim.”</p>
      <p>Management for Jungkook, whose full name is Jeon Jung-kook, apologized to the victim and concerned fans. It did not give further details about the cause of the accident, citing an ongoing investigation, but local media said he violated a traffic signal.</p>
      <p>Police officials in the central Seoul district of Yongsan declined to comment, citing internal rules.</p>
      <p>The seven-strong BTS has spearheaded a wave of <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/k-pop/">Korean pop music</a>, crowning their success with three No. 1 albums on the Billboard chart in less than a year, a 2019 Grammy nomination and concerts from New York to Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>The group last week wrapped up a world tour that included 10 cities and saw them perform in front of more than 1 million fans in total.</p>
