      <h1>Mexico deploys forces on reports of deadly ambush of Americans</h1>

      <p>Mexican national police and military forces were dispatched to the border state of Sonora on a search operation Monday night following reports that at least five U.S. citizens, including four children, were shot and killed, Mexican authorities said.</p>
      <p>The Associated Press quoted relatives as saying a U.S. woman, her 6-month-old twins and two other children, ages 8 and 10, died in the attack. They lived in La Mora, about 75 miles south of the U.S. border, where an offshoot of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been a major presence for many years, the relatives said.</p>
      <p>El Universal, one of Mexico's largest newspapers, <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/confirman-12-muertos-en-emboscada-familia-lebaron-9-de-ellos-menores">quoted other relatives</a> as saying as many as 12 members of a Mormon family were killed in what appeared to be an organized crime ambush.</p>
      <p>The reports couldn't immediately be confirmed.</p>

      <p>El Universal reported that a large group of family members were traveling to La Mora, in the municipality of Bavispe, from another part of the municipality when they were ambushed Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Mexico's national civil defense agency confirmed that elements of the National Guard, the army and the state police were conducting a search operation in Bavispe on Monday night in response to the reports. It provided no other information.</p>
      <p>The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the reports but had no further comment.</p>
