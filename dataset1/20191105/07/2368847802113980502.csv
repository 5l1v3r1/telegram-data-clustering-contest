太古血案:議員被咬落左耳已縫合 傳凶嫌為浙江仔

05 Nov 2019, 07:23

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】週日,香港太古城抗議集會活動現場發生一名男子持長刀砍傷多人並咬落議員趙家賢部份耳廓的驚人血案。目前，香港東區趙家賢被咬掉的左耳已順利縫合，另一名肺部被凶徒刺破的重傷者經搶救已脫離生命危險。有消息指操普通話的凶嫌姓陳，系浙江親共人士。9月中旬曾有消息指中共公安在大陸招募人員擬赴港裝扮暴徒肇事，因此有輿論懷疑太古城血案的凶徒正是中共專門派到香港製造白色恐怖的歹徒。
香港昨（3）日有網友號召「七區開花」上街反警暴活動。晚間有大批市民在東區的太古城中心商場集會並築起人鏈、表達訴求。
當晚7時40分左右，一名操普通話的灰衫男子於太古城中心外與港人發生口角後，突然從背包裏抽出長刀砍人，太古城東區議員趙家賢上前勸止時被凶徒凶殘的咬掉左耳朵的部份耳廓。一旁目睹凶徒行凶的民眾被激怒，圍毆並制服了凶徒，其後有警員到場，將包括凶徒在內的受傷者都送往東區醫院治療。這起事件共造成5人受傷，其中2人傷勢嚴重。
據香港《蘋果動新聞》報導，在砍人血案中受傷最重的溫先生背部、肚子等多個部位共被刺中9刀，肺部被刺穿致出現氣胸、腸臟受傷，並曾大量出血。所幸他送醫後在加護病房接受搶救及手術後，終於成功止血，現已度過了危險期，目前仍在加護病房（深切治療部）持續觀察中。
溫先生的妻子也在這起事件中被砍傷手腳，儘管傷勢沒丈夫的嚴重，但亦曾大量失血，經醫院治療，目前已無生命危險，但受傷失血較為疲倦乏力。
香港立法會議員邵家臻4日在臉書上發布消息稱，趙家賢被咬掉的左耳已順利縫回，正在休養中。
香港社群中有消息指持刀砍人的凶嫌是一名陳姓浙江親中人士，年約48歲，父母皆居於北京，有酗酒病史並曾持刀對妻子家暴。目前這些消息尚未獲得官方的證實。
當日晚間，香港警方發布的消息稱，在太古城持刀傷人及打鬥事件中，警方目前已拘捕3名涉案施襲者，其中砍人咬耳的灰衣男子被控傷人罪；另2名圍毆凶嫌的23及29歲男子也被控襲擊致造成身體傷害罪。
民主派議員針對這起血案發出了強烈譴責，同時也批評警方濫用武力，並要求特首林鄭月娥星期三在北京與國務院副總理韓正會面時向他請辭。
網絡社交媒體上眾多網民都在討論這起血案的種種疑點，主要有以下幾個關鍵要點：
其一，凶嫌講普通話，明顯來自中國大陸，砍人時卻高叫「光復台灣」，莫名其妙，是否有意嫁禍台灣？
其二，凶嫌除了持刀砍人，還瘋狂咬人，似乎吃了興奮劑。
其三，錄像顯示，警察到場後，面對危險凶嫌卻沒有立即給其戴上手銬，而是採取了一種半放任的處理方法，是否有意包庇凶嫌？
其四，港警此前拘捕抗爭市民時，四五個警察粗暴的對付一名抗爭者，即使是女性也是立刻反綁其雙手。警方對待市民與該嫌犯的行為形成強烈對比。
今年9月16日，獨立媒體《大紀元》曾報導稱，有知情者披露，深圳公安正在招聘臨時工去香港「當暴徒」，每天薪酬一千元人民幣，公安許諾會保證這些臨時工的安全。而10月19日，在香港大埔就發生了一名香港青年被一名來自大陸的男子持刀刺傷頸部並被捅傷腹部的流血事件。事後查明行凶者是一名持有「往來港澳通行證」的中國大陸人。
自從香港爆發民眾抗爭運動以來，不但香港警方對抗議者的鎮壓濫用武力的情況越來越嚴重，還發生了黑幫份子持械襲擊抗議者的惡劣事件，而香港警方對這些黑幫份子明顯持包庇縱容的態度。
有鑒於上述情況，有輿論懷疑這次在太古城持刀砍人的凶徒以及早前在大埔持刀傷人的大陸男子，很可能都是中共公安招募的「零時工」，專門到香港來製造白色恐怖，目的是以這種血腥殘暴的手段來恐嚇香港參加抗議的民眾。

Taikoo Blood Case: Members were bitten by the left ear and have been stitched.

05 Nov 2019, 07:23

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] On Sunday, a man in Hong Kong’s Taikoo City protesting rally was attacked by a man with a long knife and many people who bite off part of the auricle of the member of the House of Representatives Zhao Jiaxian. At present, the left ear that Zhao Jiaxian has bitten off in Hong Kong has been successfully stitched, and another seriously injured person who has been pierced by a murderer has been out of danger. There is news that the murderous surname Chen of the Mandarin is a member of the Zhejiang pro-communist. In mid-September, there was news that the CCP public security recruits in the mainland were planning to go to Hong Kong to dress up as rioters. Therefore, there are public opinion that the murderers of the Taikoo City bloody case are the gangsters specially sent by the CCP to Hong Kong to create white horror.
In Hong Kong yesterday (3), a netizen called for ""Seven Districts Blossoming"" to go to the streets to fight against the police. In the evening, a large number of citizens gathered in the Taikoo City Center shopping mall in the Eastern District and built a chain of people to express their aspirations.
At about 7:40 that night, a man with a mandarinous gray shirt had a long knife from the backpack outside the center of Taikoo Shing. He suddenly took a long knife from the backpack and slashed the man. The Taikoo City District Council member Zhao Jiaxian was persecuted to be bitten by the murderer. Drop part of the auricle of the left ear. The people who witnessed the murder of the murderers were angered, encircled and subdued the murderers, and then police officers were present to send the injured, including the murderers, to the Eastern Hospital for treatment. A total of five people were injured in the incident, and two of them were seriously injured.
According to Hong Kong's ""Apple News"" report, in the murder of the bloody case, the most injured Mr. Wen's back, stomach and other parts were stabbed in a total of 9 knives, the lungs were pierced and caused pneumothorax, intestinal injuries, and a large number Bleeding. Fortunately, after he was sent to the intensive care unit for rescue and surgery, he finally succeeded in stopping bleeding. He has now passed the dangerous period and is still in the intensive care unit (deep treatment department) for continuous observation.
Mr. Wen’s wife was also chopped in this incident. Although she was not seriously injured by her husband, she also suffered a lot of blood loss. After treatment at the hospital, she is now life-threatening, but her blood loss is relatively tired and weak.
Hong Kong Legislative Council member Shao Jiaxuan released a message on Facebook on the 4th that Zhao Jiaxian’s left ear had been successfully sewn back and was recuperating.
There is news in the Hong Kong community that the murder of a knife is a Chen relative in Zhejiang. He is about 48 years old. His parents are living in Beijing. He has a history of alcoholism and has a knife against his wife. These news have not yet been officially confirmed.
On the evening of the same day, the Hong Kong police reported that in the Taigu City knife wounding and fighting incident, the police have arrested three suspects involved in the case, including the gray-haired man who slashed his ear and was charged with wounding; another 2 The 23- and 29-year-old men who were suspected of being murdered were also charged with assault causing bodily harm.
Democrats strongly condemned the bloody case and criticized the police for indiscriminate use of force and asked the Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue to resign from him during a meeting with Vice Premier Han Zheng in Beijing on Wednesday.
Many netizens on the online social media are discussing the various doubts of this bloody case, mainly including the following key points:
First, the murder of Mandarin is obviously from mainland China. When hacking people, it is called ""Recovering Taiwan"". It is inexplicable. Is it intentional to blame Taiwan?
Second, the murderer, besides holding a knife and hacking people, is also biting people crazy, and seems to have eaten stimulants.
Thirdly, the video shows that after the police arrived on the scene, they did not immediately handcuff them in the face of dangerous suspicions. Instead, they adopted a semi-discretionary approach. Is it intentional to cover up the suspicion?
Fourth, when the Hong Kong police arrested the anti-competitives, four or five police officers violently dealt with a protester. Even women were immediately tied to their hands. The police treated the public in sharp contrast to the behavior of the suspect.
On September 16 this year, the independent media ""The Epoch Times"" reported that an insider disclosed that Shenzhen Public Security is hiring temporary workers to go to Hong Kong as ""a mob"" and pays 1,000 yuan a day. The public security promises to ensure the safety of these temporary workers. . On October 19, a Hong Kong youth was attacked by a man from the mainland who stabbed his neck with a knife and was stabbed in the abdomen. Afterwards, it was found that the perpetrator was a mainland Chinese who held a ""passport to Hong Kong and Macau"".
Since the outbreak of the popular protest movement in Hong Kong, not only has the Hong Kong police’s crackdown on the protesters’ use of force been more and more serious, but also the gang’s violent incidents of armed attack on the protesters, and the Hong Kong police have clearly harbored these concubines. Attitude.
In view of the above situation, there is public opinion that this time the murderer who was slashing in Taikoo City and the mainland man who had wounded a knife in Tai Po earlier, may all be ""zero-time workers"" recruited by the CCP public security, specializing in Hong Kong. The purpose of creating white horror is to use this bloody and brutal means to intimidate people in Hong Kong to participate in the protests.
