      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. – Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will be in Southwest Florida on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis will be at Lover's Key State Park at noon.</p>
      <p>They're scheduled to make an announcement with state environmental and health leaders.</p>
      <p>They will be joined by Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Noah Valenstein, State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees, and Florida Fish and Wildlife <br/>Conservation Commission Executive Director Eric Sutton.</p>
      <p>Earlier Tuesday, Gov. DeSantis was in Martin County to announce the launching of a new online resource that will allow the public to find out current water quality numbers and projects. The site, <a href="https://protectingfloridatogether.gov/">Protect Florida Together</a> , is billed as a “one stop shop” multi-agency tool for transparency in the state’s effort to improve its water quality.</p>
