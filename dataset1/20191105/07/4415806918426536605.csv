A man has been killed in a shooting in Co Meath last night.
The scene in Bettystown is sealed off pending a technical examination.
The man was shot outside his home in the Castlemartin Estate in Bettystown at around 11.40pm.
The man, 39, received a number of gunshot wounds and was removed by Ambulance to Our lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.
He was pronounced dead shortly before 1am this morning.
