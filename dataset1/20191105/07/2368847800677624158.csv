消息：港府內部曾考慮特赦示威者 林鄭不同意

05 Nov 2019, 07:22

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】習近平在上海接見香港特首林鄭月娥之際，香港電台5日披露，港府內部曾考慮特赦香港反送中運動中被捕者的可行性，但特首林鄭不同意。
10月5日，香港電台報導說，香港政府內部曾經思考過引用《基本法》48條12款，特赦反送中活動中被捕人士的可行性，但必須要先完成整個司法程序。
如果行使特赦權也不能「一刀切」，要逐一審視每個已判決的個案，也不能單憑特首個人想法決定特赦誰，而是要有劃一和客觀的執行標準，例如，基於獨立調查委員會的建議，或宗教領袖等人士提出的呼籲。
報導說，特首辦回覆记者查詢時表示，《基本法》有賦予行政長官赦免或減輕刑事罪犯刑罰的職權，同時特首也清楚表示，不希望發放被捕人士會獲赦免的錯誤信息。
律政司則回覆說，一直就現時的情況，針對不同的政策和措施進行法律研究，向政府相關部門提供法律意見。
《基本法》賦予特首行使的赦免或減輕刑事罪犯刑罰的職權，只可在定罪後才能行使。

事實上，早在8月27日，林鄭在記者會上駁回示威者要求「成立獨立調查委員會」的訴求之時。就有消息稱，林鄭在此前的閉門會議上，不但拒絕民間的五大訴求，並要求多抓人，直到抓到沒有人示威為止。
據香港01引述掌握港府想法的建制派消息稱，港府高層研判，要一次回應民間5大訴求，幾乎是不可能的任務。尤其是成立獨立調查委員會，一宣布就會重挫警隊士氣，到時還有誰會幫政府鎮壓遍地開花的示威行動？
所以港府敲定策略，一動不如一靜，與示威者打「消耗戰」。何為「消耗戰」策略？即警方暴力應對示威行動，每次遊行或集會都拘捕示威者，能多抓就多抓，當示威者中的「勇武」核心分子都被拘捕，或不敢再出來，示威行動才可平息。
根據香港警方數字，從6月9日至10月10日的反送中運動中，至少2379人被捕，當中104人是16歲以下，其中750人、超過3成是18歲以下。
而被暴力打傷的人數更是難以估計，因怕被抓捕關押，很多人受傷後不敢去醫院救治。公開報導顯示，被捕者最小12歲，受傷者最小僅8歲。
港府的強硬態度和警察的血腥鎮壓，非但沒有使反送中行動降溫，反而激起港人更大怒火，遊行示威已經遍布香港各地區，而且各階層、各團體也陸續站出來聲援反送中示威。
示威者一方數次召開民間記者會，譴責警方濫施暴力，濫捕市民，並表達「自由之心不死 奈何以槍斃之」的抗爭決心。
而中共對港人的打壓仍在無底線的升級，派出大批中共臥底公安和換裝港警，及黑幫蓄意製造混亂，為其鎮壓香港製造口實。

林鄭也多次堅稱，不會答應示威者要求成立獨立調查委員會的訴求。路透社9月2日公開的錄音中，提到林鄭月娥向現場與會人士說，「我除了3萬警察，其他什麼都沒有……。」
英國《金融時報》10月23日說，林鄭很可能於明年3月前被撤換下台。消息傳出後，林鄭在接受訪問時，罕見表明自己並非要「盲撐」警隊，並說監警會報告年底發表，如果民意仍然不滿，有責任尋找其他的調查機制，如獨立調查委員會。
林鄭月娥對成立獨立調查委員會鬆口後，香港高等法院突然頒布臨時禁制令，阻止對警察及其家屬進行起底，有效期至11月8日。該禁制令再度引發民眾對港警濫暴的擔憂。
此臨時禁制令，明顯賦予警方更大權力，和林鄭關於成立調查委員會的意圖相反。
全國港澳研究會副會長劉兆佳對《明報》表示，目前香港社會處於高度政治對立的鬥爭中，料林鄭說法是兩邊都不收貨，反對派會斥她拖延時間，建制派就會批她立場不夠堅定、打擊警隊士氣。
劉兆佳說，林鄭已無法取得反對派支持，若要繼續管治香港，需站在建制派一邊、建立堅實的聯盟，指林鄭嘗試在中間遊走只會「兩頭不到岸」。
不過，新華社11月4日報導，出席第二屆上海進博會的習近平，會見了同來參會的林鄭月娥。在聽取了林鄭關於香港局勢的匯報後，習近平對林鄭和港府給予「充分肯定」，並稱「中央對你高度信任」，並強調繼續「止暴制亂」。
據港媒報導，林鄭5日還在北京出席粵港澳大灣區會議，6日將獲中共中央港澳小組組長韓正接見。觀察人士認為，北京突然高調挺林鄭，有替林鄭去職「闢謠」之意。
「林鄭下台」是港人「五大訴求」之一。北京力挺林鄭，或顯示拒不妥協之意。而剛剛結束的中共四中全會，也明確要對香港加強管制。
時局分析人士鄭中原分析說，中共無視港人抗爭的民意和對警暴的民憤，以一次中央全會統一意志，要進一步加大打壓港人，只會引發更大反彈。而林鄭「十一」進京參加閱兵式後馬上拋出《禁蒙面法》，這次又獲習近平和韓正會見，或許意味着香港局勢將進一步惡化。

News: Special protesters have been considered inside the Hong Kong government. Lin Zheng disagrees.

05 Nov 2019, 07:22

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] When Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai, Radio Television Hong Kong revealed on the 5th that the Hong Kong government had considered the feasibility of the arrest of the Hong Kong reversal movement, but the Chief Executive Lin Zheng disagreed.
On October 5, Radio Television Hong Kong reported that the Hong Kong government had considered internally citing Article 48, paragraph 12 of the Basic Law, specifically for the feasibility of retrieving the arrested persons in the activities, but must complete the entire judicial process first.
If you exercise the right of amnesty, you can't ""one size fits all"". You have to examine each case that has been decided one by one, and you can't decide who you want to be by the chief executive's idea. Instead, you must have uniform and objective performance standards, for example, based on the recommendations of the independent commission of inquiry. , or appeals from people such as religious leaders.
The report said that the Chief Executive's Office replied to the reporter's enquiry and said that the Basic Law had the power to grant the Chief Executive pardon or reduce the penalties of criminal offenders. At the same time, the Chief Executive also made it clear that he did not wish to issue the wrong information that the arrested person would be pardoned.
The Attorney General replied that he has been conducting legal research on different policies and measures in the current situation and providing legal advice to relevant government departments.
The powers granted by the Chief Law to pardon or reduce the penalties of criminal offenders can only be exercised after conviction.

In fact, as early as August 27, Lin Zheng dismissed the protesters’ request for the establishment of an independent investigation committee at the press conference. It is reported that Lin Zheng not only refused the five major demands of the people in the previous closed-door meeting, but also demanded more arrests until no one was arrested.
According to the Hong Kong 01 quoted the founding party who grasped the idea of the Hong Kong government, the high-level officials of the Hong Kong government judged that it is almost impossible to respond to the five major demands of the people. In particular, the establishment of an independent investigation committee will reduce the morale of the police force when it is announced. Who will help the government to suppress the demonstrations that blossom everywhere?
Therefore, the Hong Kong Government has finalized its strategy, and it is better to be quiet than to protest. What is the ""consumption war"" strategy? That is, the police violently responded to the demonstrations. Every time they marched or gathered, they arrested the demonstrators. They could catch more and grab more. When the ""brave"" core elements of the demonstrators were arrested, or dare not come out again, the demonstrations could be quelled.
According to Hong Kong police figures, at least 2,379 people were arrested during the anti-delivery campaign from June 9 to October 10. Among them, 104 were under 16 years old, of which 750 and more than 30% were under 18 years old.
The number of people who have been violently injured is even more difficult to estimate. Because they are afraid of being arrested and detained, many people are afraid to go to hospital after being injured. According to public reports, the arrested person is at least 12 years old and the injured person is only 8 years old.
The tough attitude of the Hong Kong Government and the bloody suppression of the police have not only cooled down the anti-delivery actions, but have aroused greater anger among the people of Hong Kong. The demonstrations have spread throughout Hong Kong, and various classes and groups have also stood up to support the anti-delivery. Demonstration in the middle.
The demonstrators held several private press conferences, condemning the police for indiscriminate use of violence, overcharting the public, and expressing the determination to fight ""the heart of freedom is not dead.""
The CCP’s suppression of the people of Hong Kong is still upgrading without a bottom line. A large number of CCP undercover police officers and re-installed port police are dispatched, and the gangs deliberately create chaos to suppress Hong Kong’s manufacturing.

Lin Zheng also insisted on many times that he would not agree to the demands of the demonstrators to set up an independent investigation committee. In a public recording published by Reuters on September 2, Lin Zhengyue said to the participants at the scene, ""I have nothing but 30,000 police.""
The British ""Financial Times"" said on October 23 that Lin Zheng is likely to be replaced before March next year. After the news came out, when Lin Zheng was interviewed, it was rare to show that he did not want to ""blind up"" the police force. He said that the IPCC reported that it would be published at the end of the year. If the public opinion is still dissatisfied, it is the responsibility to find other investigation mechanisms, such as the independent investigation committee.
After Lin Zhengyue’s establishment of the Independent Investigation Commission in Songkou, the Hong Kong High Court suddenly issued an interim injunction to prevent the police and their families from starting, valid until November 8. The injunction has once again triggered public concern about the port violence.
This temporary injunction clearly gives the police greater power, contrary to Lin Zheng’s intention to set up a commission of inquiry.
Liu Zhaojia, vice president of the National Hong Kong and Macao Research Association, told Ming Pao that the current Hong Kong society is in a highly political confrontation. It is said that Lin Zheng said that neither side will accept the goods, and the opposition will refute her delay, and the establishment will approve her position. Not strong enough to combat the morale of the police.
Liu Zhaojia said that Lin Zheng has been unable to obtain opposition support. If he wants to continue to govern Hong Kong, he needs to stand on the side of the establishment and establish a solid alliance. It is said that Lin Zheng’s attempt to swim in the middle will only ""become two ends.""
However, Xinhua News Agency reported on November 4 that Xi Jinping, who attended the second Shanghai Expo, met with Lin Zhengyue, who was attending the conference. After listening to Lin Zheng’s report on the situation in Hong Kong, Xi Jinping gave ""full affirmation"" to Lin Zheng and the Hong Kong government, and said that ""the central government has a high degree of trust in you"" and stressed that it will continue to ""stop the storm.""
According to Hong Kong media reports, Lin Zheng also attended the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Great Bay Area meeting in Beijing on the 5th. On the 6th, he will be interviewed by Han Zheng, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee. Observers believe that Beijing suddenly has a high profile of Lin Zheng and has the intention of ""resolving"" for Lin Zheng.
""Lin Zheng is stepping down"" is one of the ""five major demands"" of the people of Hong Kong. Beijing is strong against Lin Zheng, or it shows that it refuses to compromise. The just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party also clearly wants to strengthen control over Hong Kong.
Zheng Zhongyuan, an analyst at the time, analyzed that the CCP’s disregard of the public opinion of the Hong Kong people’s struggle and the public anger against the police force, with a unified will of the Central Plenary Meeting, to further increase the suppression of the Hong Kong people, will only trigger a greater rebound. Lin Zheng’s ""Eleventh"" went to Beijing to participate in the military parade and immediately threw out the ""Forbidden Mask Method"". This time, Xi Jinping and Han Zheng met again, which may mean that the situation in Hong Kong will further deteriorate.
