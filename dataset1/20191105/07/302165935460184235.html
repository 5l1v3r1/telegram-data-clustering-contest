      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 5 — Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves set tongues wagging when he walked down the red carpet hand-in-hand with artist Alexandra Grant recently.</p>
      <p>The pair were attending the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Various publications reported that it was the first time Reeves has ever attended a red carpet event with a date throughout his 35-year career.</p>
      <p>Their public display of affection fueled the curiosity of fans who couldn’t help but wonder if Reeves, affectionately nicknamed the “internet’s boyfriend”, was dating Grant for real.</p>
      <p>Either way, many social media users were over the moon to see the 55-year-old with a companion they deemed to be “age-appropriate”.</p>
      <p>Various publications have reported Grant’s age as 46 years old.</p>

      <p>According to <i>People</i> magazine, the Reeves and Grant have been “friends and collaborators” for years and have previously worked together on two books together, <i>Ode to Happiness</i> and <i>Shadows</i>.</p>
      <p>They also founded a publishing house in 2017 named X Artists’ Books.</p>
      <p>Reeves became the subject of mass adoration online following a slew of appearances in popular films this year, including <i>John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum</i>, <i>Always Be My Maybe</i>, and <i>Toy Story 4</i>.</p>
      <p>While the Canadian actor can’t quite fathom the Internet’s obsession with him, he welcomes it all the same.</p>
      <p>“... That’s wacky. Well, the positivity is great,” he was quoted as saying by <i>People</i>.</p>
      <p>He’s set to return to the franchise that catapulted him to global stardom when production on the fourth <i>Matrix</i> film begins next year.</p>
