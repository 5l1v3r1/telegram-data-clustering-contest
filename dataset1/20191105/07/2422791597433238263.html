      <p>NEW YORK - An advice columnist who has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.</p>
      <p>E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump “smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity - all in the national press” when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.</p>
      <p>“Nobody is entitled to conceal acts of sexual assault behind a wall of defamatory falsehoods and deflections,” Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan wrote in the suit.</p>
      <p>A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.</p>
      <p>Carroll, a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine, is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.</p>
      <p>She isn't the only one to sue over his denials. One such case, filed by Summer Zervos, a onetime contestant on his former reality show, “The Apprentice,” is ongoing in the same Manhattan courthouse where Carroll has filed her claim.</p>
      <p>Carroll says she bumped into the then-real estate developer in the high-end store Bergdorf Goodman in 1995 or 1996, and he asked her to help him pick out a gift for “a girl” and eventually suggested lingerie. He suggested Carroll try on a see-through bodysuit, she said, and after a joking exchange, they went into a dressing room.</p>
      <p>She says Trump then pushed her against a wall, pulled down her tights and raped her as she struggled, eventually broke free and fled.</p>
      <p>Carroll said there were no attendants in the dressing room area. She didn't file a police report but said she did tell two journalist friends. Both have corroborated that they were told.</p>
      <p>Trump said in June that Carroll was “totally lying,” termed the accusation “fake news” and called her “not my type.”</p>
      <p>He also said he'd never met her, though a 1987 photo shows him and Carroll in a photo with their spouses at the time.</p>
      <p>“Give me a break,” Trump said of the photo, noting it shows his back to the camera.</p>
      <p>The suit says Trump harmed Carroll's reputation and career. It seeks unspecified damages.</p>
