Up in smoke: Imperial Brands profit shrinks as regulators knock vaping
05 Nov 2019, 07:33 by Joe Curtis
Imperial Brands blamed “tough trading” in its vaping division after full-year profits slipped and shareholders saw earnings per share fall by a quarter.
The figures
Operating profit fell 8.7 per cent to £2.2bn in the 12 months to the end of September.
That came despite a 5.1 per cent rise in revenue to £31.59bn. Earnings per share sank 26.2 per cent to 106p, down from 2018’s 143.6p.
Its NGP line revenue posted growth of 52.4 per cent to £285m, while tobacco net revenue rose 2.7 per cent to £7.7bn.
Meanwhile net debt ticked up by £71m year on year to £11.97bn.
Why it’s interesting
The results won’t come as much of a surprise for many.
In late September, shares in the tobacco giant fell 13 per cent after the company issued a profits warning on the back of a US-led backlash against vaping.
Prior to the September warning, Imperial Brands had already refined its dividend policy, abandoning a plan to increase the shareholder distribution at a trend rate of 10% a year.
A week later chief executive Alison Cooper, who had been with the cigarette manufacturer for 20 years, announced that she would step down after nine years in the role.
Last week US tobacco company Altria reported a $4.5bn (£3.5bn) loss in the third quarter of 2019, driven by its 35 per cent stake in Juul, as the e-cigarette maker’s products were banned in several cities and states.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “At least this means the bar of expectations has been set fairly low for these results from the owner of the JPS, Gauloises, Davidoff and Golden Virginia brands.”
What Imperial Brands said
Outgoing CEO Alison Cooper said:
2019 has been a challenging year with results below our expectations due to tough trading in NGP. We are implementing actions to drive a stronger performance in the coming year.Our resilient tobacco value creation model continues to produce high margin sales growth and is well-placed to deliver sustained profitable growth in the years ahead.Although we grew NGP revenues by around 50 per cent, this was below the level we expected to deliver. Our delivery was also impacted by an increasingly competitive environment and regulatory uncertainty in the USA. Growth in Europe was also slower, despite achieving leading retail shares in several markets. We have taken the learnings from this year to reset our NGP investment plans for 2020, prioritising the markets and categories with the highest potential for sustainable, profitable growth. We will scale up investment as the visibility on returns and regulatory uncertainties improves.Our priority going forward is to optimise the profit and cash generation from our tobacco assets, while improving growth in NGP with greater discipline and a more tightly focused business model that will create long-term value for shareholders.
