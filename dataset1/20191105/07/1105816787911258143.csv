05 Nov 2019, 07:08 by News Desk
A man dressed in women’s clothing stole three million dirhams from a safe using hydraulic tools, but Dubai Police was able to nab him within 47 minutes of his crime.



According to Gulf News, Dubai Police already had knowledge of a well-known criminal gang operating in the area, who had been linked to a string of burglaries.
They received tip offs about a man dressed in women’s clothing carrying a handbag who was wandering around residential and tourist areas in Dubai.
When police caught up with the European suspect, he had already changed back to men’s clothes.
However, they discovered expensive watches and cash in his bag that amounted to the aforementioned amount.

Retracing the suspect’s movements

When retracing the suspect’s movements, they also found another bag that the suspect had hidden. It contained hydraulic equipment that was used to cut a hole into the side of a safe located at the house of a European merchant that the suspect had burgled less than an hour earlier.
The suspect had targeted the merchant’s property because he knew the victim had flown back to Europe with his pregnant wife.
Police later discovered the safe that was broken into had Dh10 million in it but that the suspect had rushed the job and had only been able to steal Dh3 million worth of cash and precious items.

Dressed in women’s uniform

Dressed in women’s uniform, he walked around the area between residential and tourist locations, with a medium-sized bag.

Through the high security of the organised crime team, a suspect was arrested, wearing plain men’s clothes and a medium-sized bag that matched the description of the classified information.
