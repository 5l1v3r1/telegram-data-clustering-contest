      <h2>It has previously been reported that some young players at the club mock manager Unai Emery at London Colney</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:50:23+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:50</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Some of the Arsenal youngsters are turning to assistant head coach Freddie Ljungberg for guidance instead of manager Unai Emery, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Gunners boss Emery is under increasing pressure in north London, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> having won just two of their opening nine fixtures in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has assurances from the board that he isn't in immediate danger of getting the sack, but Emery needs to find a winning formula soon.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, it has been claimed that some of the youngsters at the club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-insider-claims-players-mercilessly-20787993">poke fun at their boss at Arsenal's London Colney training base.</a></p>

      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/transfer-news/inside-unai-emery-crisis-jose-17195279?_ga=2.76826966.2105554714.1572936866-949429378.1572936866">football.london,</a> others are turning to Ljungberg for direction because they feel their boss "does not offer clear and consistent instructions".</p>
      <p>Emery has been praised for making the effort to speak English in his press conferences, but he is still yet to learn the language fluently.</p>

      <p>Former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie recently brought attention to this, and claimed it makes understanding his instructions difficult.</p>
      <p>"I've had [Arsene] Wenger, Louis van Gaal, [Sir Alex] Ferguson, so many coaches," said the Dutchman on BT Sport.</p>

      <p>"Their main quality was to be clear. If I'm really honest, someone sent me a video of him [Emery] last week trying to explain something, and I couldn't figure out if he was saying 'come, come' or 'come!'.</p>
      <p>"That is very important. You have to be clear, you have to be the leader and the leader needs to be clear towards his players."</p>
