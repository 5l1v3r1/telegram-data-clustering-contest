港警「自編自演」 尷尬舉辦沒有記者的記者會

05 Nov 2019, 07:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】過去一週，香港警方明顯針對記者使用暴力，亦開始拘捕進行正常採訪的前線記者。香港警方11月4日下午舉行記者會，有6名香港記者戴頭盔各頂一字組成標語「查警暴止警謊」，以示不滿，警方最後取消記者會，其後警方「自編自演」，自行錄製記者會視頻，成為一場沒有記者在場的記者會。
綜合媒體報導，香港反送中運動持續不斷，香港警隊針對記者施行的言語甚至肢體暴力越發嚴重。11月3日再有特約記者及學生記者在正常採訪期間，被防暴警員拘捕。
《立場新聞》一名特約攝影記者，11月3日晚在太古城中心採訪期間，亦被警方以涉嫌「阻差辦公」拘捕。新聞片段顯示，涉事記者被捕前正在一段距離外拍攝警員的行動，惟多名防暴警員突然衝前，將記者壓在地上拘捕。
香港警方11月4日下午舉行記者會，有6名香港記者頭戴貼有標語「查警暴、止警謊」的頭盔，坐在最後排，警方要求展示標語的6名記者離開，6名記者拒絕，約20分鐘後警方取消記者會。參加抗議的記者，分別來自香港電台，端傳媒，立場新聞，AM730，《明報》。
就在記者會被取消後，警方自行安排另一場新聞發布會，講解警方的立場，但這場發布會只是警方自己錄製視頻，並沒有記者在場。
主持記者會的警察公共關係科總督察高振邦說，記者會是警方和市民重要溝通渠道，成功運作有賴互相尊重，並非讓傳媒表達自己意願的平台，有意見向警方反映，可以透過合適場合和渠道，他們不負責任的行為，對在場其他專業傳媒不公道。
被要求離場的記者說，他們並非示威，只是服飾上有不同，沒有阻礙記者會進行，警方取消記者會是剝奪公眾知情權，而非記者。
在記者會上展示標語的香港記者協會執委陳朗升表示，前線記者的處境已處於十分危險的境地，警方高層作出的承諾，跟前線警員的實際行為，差距很大:「今天我們這個行動並非示威，亦不是抗議，我們在服飾上作一個配合，是希望在服飾上表達給警方知道，警方經常說，記者和警方之間要互相尊重，記者會上就叫互相尊重，我們去到示威的現場，我們的同行被捕，被胡椒噴霧噴射、受傷，這不是警方所說，不是針對記者的行為。」
香港記者協會、香港攝影記者協會、明報職工協會、壹傳媒工會及港台節目製作人員工會等多個新聞工會及傳媒機構發表聯署聲明，強烈譴責警方以各種不同手段阻礙記者採訪，以及任意拘捕記者，要求警方立即釋放被捕記者。
聲明說，各種事件正衝擊着基本法保障新聞自由的底線，促請特首林鄭月娥履行競選時簽署「新聞自由約章」的承諾，堅決捍衛新聞自由。
此外，浸會大學學生會也發表聲明，強烈譴責警方11月4日晚在太古城無理拘捕校內編委會的新聞系學生記者，指記者當時正進行採訪，並佩戴學生會有效記者證及記協學生會員證，強調記者當時並沒有參與任何前線示威行動。學生會又指，涉事記者被捕後曾被警員以涉及性暴力的言語威嚇。

Hong Kong Police ""self-produced"" 尴尬 held a press conference without reporters

05 Nov 2019, 07:17

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] In the past week, the Hong Kong police apparently used violence against journalists and began to arrest front-line reporters for normal interviews. The Hong Kong police held a press conference on the afternoon of November 4th. Six Hong Kong journalists wore a helmet with a slogan ""Checking the police and slamming the police"" to show dissatisfaction. The police finally canceled the press conference and the police ""made their own performances."" Self-recorded video of the press conference and became a press conference without reporters.
According to comprehensive media reports, the Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign continued, and the words and even physical violence of the Hong Kong Police Force against journalists became more serious. On November 3rd, special correspondents and student reporters were arrested by riot police officers during the normal interview.
A special photojournalist from ""Standing News"" was arrested by the police on the alleged ""resistance office"" during the interview at Taikoo Shing Center on the evening of November 3. The news clip shows that the reporters were shooting police officers from a distance before the arrest of the reporters. However, many riot police officers suddenly rushed forward and arrested the reporters on the ground.
The Hong Kong police held a press conference on the afternoon of November 4th. Six Hong Kong journalists wore helmets with the slogan ""Check police riots, stop lie"" and sit in the last row. The police asked the six reporters who showed the slogan to leave, 6 The reporter refused, and the police canceled the press conference after about 20 minutes. The journalists who participated in the protests came from RTHK, Duan Media, Position News, AM730, Ming Pao.
Just after the press conference was cancelled, the police arranged another press conference to explain the police's position. However, the press conference only recorded the video by the police themselves, and no reporter was present.
Gao Zhengbang, chief inspector of the Police Public Relations Branch who presided over the press conference, said that the press conference is an important communication channel between the police and the public. The successful operation depends on mutual respect. It is not a platform for the media to express its wishes. Some opinions are reflected to the police and can be used through appropriate occasions and channels. Their irresponsible behavior is unfair to other professional media present.
The reporters who were asked to leave said that they were not demonstrations, but that they were different in costumes and did not hinder the press conference. The police’s cancellation of the press conference deprived the public of the right to know, not journalists.
Chen Langsheng, executive director of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, who showed slogans at the press conference, said that the situation of frontline reporters is already in a very dangerous situation. The commitment made by the top police officers is very different from the actual behavior of frontline police officers: ""Today our actions are not The demonstrations were not protests. We made a cooperation in the costumes. We hoped to express them in the costumes to the police. The police often said that the reporters and the police should respect each other. At the press conference, they called mutual respect. We went to the demonstrations. At the scene, our peers were arrested and sprayed and injured by pepper spray. This is not what the police said, not the behavior of journalists.""
The Hong Kong Journalists Association, the Hong Kong Photojournalist Association, the Ming Pao Workers Association, the Yu Media Association and the Hong Kong and Taiwan Broadcasting Staff Union and other news unions and media organizations issued a joint statement strongly condemning the police for blocking interviews by various means and arbitrary arrests. The reporter asked the police to immediately release the arrested journalist.
The statement said that various incidents are slamming the bottom line of the Basic Law to protect freedom of the press, and urged the Chief Executive, Mr. Lin Zhengyue, to fulfill his commitment to sign the ""Freedom of Information Charter"" during the election campaign and firmly defend the freedom of the press.
In addition, the Baptist University Student Union also issued a statement strongly condemning the police reporters in the journalism of the editorial board of the school in Taikoo City on the evening of November 4, saying that the reporter was conducting an interview and wearing a student journalist’s valid journalist’s card and journalists. The membership card emphasizes that the reporter did not participate in any frontline demonstrations at the time. The Student Union also pointed out that after the arrest of the reporter, the police officer was threatened by police officers who used sexual violence.
