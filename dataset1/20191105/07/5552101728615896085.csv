中國國台辦昨公布《26條措施》，內容包含台資企業在5G、融資等投資上可與當地企業有同等待遇，在個人方面，台人也有向中國駐外使館尋求協助等待遇。對此，我陸委會、外交部強硬表示其目的為企圖影響台灣選舉。今中國央視主播海霞則在節目中喊話「台灣的命運與祖國相連。灣灣，回家吧。」
央視主播海霞於「主播說聯播」節目上提及對台《26條措施》，並表示看完這些措施就是一個感覺「實打實」，比如台資企業可參與中國5G網絡建設、台胞在海外遇到困難可向中國使領館尋求幫助等等，就是要讓台灣同胞享受大陸同胞同等待遇。
海霞表示，我們拿出真心對待台灣同胞，只因我們都是中國人。在大陸，這裡就是你的祖國。在海外，你的身後站著的是中國。這麼實的措施，給廣大台灣同胞帶來了實實在在的機會，並認為「我們拿出真心對待台灣同胞，只因我們都是中國人。」
海霞同時也批評，指有些人放出了一些奇談怪論，甚至造謠抹黑，「其實他們要是沒有一顆中國心，又怎麼能理解我們的真心？這些荒唐言論或許恰恰說明他們的確是有些慌了」。最後也喊話「台灣的前途繫於國家統一，台灣的命運與祖國相連。灣灣，回家吧。」
而這段影片也登上微博熱搜，許多中國網友留言表示「灣灣，媽媽喊你回家吃飯了」「希望有生之年看到台灣回歸」，而台灣網友認為「飛彈對著我們的是誰，有哪個媽媽會拿刀對著所謂的孩子？」「虎姑婆走開」。
