Martin Scorsese's statement on Marvel Cinematic Universe films might have grabbed a lot of attention but seems like the Oscar-winning filmmaker was impressed with Joaquin Phoenix's film 'Joker'.
In an interview with a Hollywood portal, Scorsese also revealed that he had spent four years considering the idea of possibly directing 'Joker' but couldn't go ahead with it due to lack of time. Not only that Scorsese also admitted that it was his personal call to move ahead with other projects.
While his MCU movies not being considered as cinema statement giving way to a whirlwind of controversy, Hollywood seemed to be divided into different groups with their own perspective over the hot topic.
While the Todd Phillips directorial breaking several records overseas, the film has gone on to become one of the best R-rated films in the history of cinema. Not only that but Phoenix's standalone film has also brought him into the consideration for Oscar as he managed to excel and give the best performance of his career in 'Joker'.
