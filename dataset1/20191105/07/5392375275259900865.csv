The much-awaited November 5th by Xiaomi is here. As expected, the company has a couple of products lineup for the unveiling. Kicking things off, the brand has today expanded its Smart TV lineup with the launch of the Xiaomi Mi TV 5 series. The TV unveiled today is actually the Xiaomi Mi TV 5 series, and the Mi TV 5 Pro, and as expected, there are a number of them that make up the series.
There isn’t much that we already do not know about the TV as the company already revealed all prior to today. First off, the Xiaomi TV 5 Pro comes in three variants –  55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch Xiaomi TV 5 Pro.
The three variants are all encased in an aluminum frame and come with a screw-less design and are just 5.9mm thick with little or no bezel. At 1.8mm, the bezel is about 47.1 percent narrower compared to the Mi TV 4. The key highlights of the Mi TV 5 Pro is its Quantum Dot display, HDR 10+, support MEMC motion compensation, and 8K video support.






The Mi TV 5 Pro run on PatchWall UI with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage to ensure smoother performance.  And on the final note, the TV comes with Dolby Audio and DTS HD Sound.
