Punk persecution: how East Germany cracked down on alternative lifestyles - in pictures

05 Nov 2019, 07:01

Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany’s secret police regarded punks as the most dangerous youth element in the country and ‘the leading force’ behind anti-government activities. These unnamed police mugshots from the former DDR demonstrate the lengths to which the security services would surveil, harass and detain punk ‘adherents’ and ‘sympathisers’.

Burning Down the Haus: Punk Rock, Revolution and the Fall of the Berlin Wall by Tim Mohr is published by Dialogue Books




As punks became more visible in the 1980s, the Kriminalpolizei’s political division, K1, and the Stasi division responsible for subverting underground political activity, stepped in to institute a cohesive policy of repression

Following the K1 and Stasi crackdown, about 250 punks were immediately forced to sign documents identifying themselves as potential criminal elements

During the most draconian periods, many punks could barely appear in public before being picked up for interrogation

Working in conjunction with the Stasi, the K1 sought to solve the punk problem by eliminating punks from public view. They instituted a blanket ban on punks in bars, cafes, restaurants, and youth clubs. And they made it clear that any establishment caught ignoring the ban stood to lose its license

Sometimes punks were detained on the grounds that they didn’t look like their official ID photos. They would be issued with replacement IDs that prevented them crossing the border to other Eastern Bloc countries, and limited their ability to travel even within East Germany (DDR)

Many of the punks would receive regular summonses to police stations, where they were questioned about their political beliefs, the slogans written on their badges and clothes, and their circle of friends

In the early 1980s the secret police estimated the nationwide number of punk ‘adherents’ at 1,000. Punk ‘sympathisers’, who were likewise ‘recognisable by their appearance’ ran to 10,000, in a country of 15m people

In an East German government report on the ‘preliminary findings of youth analysis’ dated 12 January 12 1989, punk was identified by authorities as the top problem
Photograph: BStU



Punks had developed a scene independent of DDR officialdom, including, as the report pointed out, the creation of a grey-market economy as well as communications nodes and a national network to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas
Photograph: BStU



East German authorities noted that punks who had been expatriated to the west were involved in anarchist and leftist extremist circles that in turn cultivated links with those still in the east
