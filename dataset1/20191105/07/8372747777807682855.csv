LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- More than 3,000 Burmese pythons have been captured in Florida as part of efforts to control the invasive species.
Governor Ron DeSantis says the state’s Python Action Team has removed 1,000 pythons from the wild. That's on top of the 2,600 removed by the state's Python Elimination Program, which recruits hunters from around the state.
Both programs began in 2017.
And if you want to learn how to catch pythons, on Wednesday there is a class that will show you how.
A free Python Patrol class will be held at Lover’s Key on Fort Myers Beach on Wednesday, November 6th. The 1:30 training class is still open.
The class includes training on how to catch the pythons, and the rules and regulations hunters have to follow.
There will be hands-on training, and the class is 2-3 hours long.
