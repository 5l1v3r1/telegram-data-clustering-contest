      <h1>Outrage as Oscars disqualifies Nigeria's entry - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:06:27+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361050-outrage-as-oscars-disqualifies-nigerias-entry.html" target="_blank">Jayne Augoye</a></address>
      <p>‘Lion Heart’, Nigeria’s first Oscars entry, has been disqualified from the race for the ‘Best International Feature Film’ category.</p>
      <p>The Academy on Monday said the Genevieve Nnaji-directed movie, was disqualified because it violates the rule that entries in the category must have “a predominantly non-English dialogue track.”</p>
      <p>‘Lion heart’ is partially in the Igbo language but it is mostly in English.</p>
      <p>Nnaji stars alongside Peter Edochie and Nkem Owoh in the film, which she also co-wrote with her producing partner, Chinny Onwugbenu.</p>
      <p>Lionheart premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival and was acquired by Netflix for worldwide distribution.</p>
      <p>The decision to disqualify the movie has however sparked outrage, with many saying English is the official language of Nigeria and hence it shouldn’t have been disqualified.</p>
      <h4>‘Rules and rules’</h4>
      <p>According to the Academy’s rules for the international feature film category, “an international film is defined as a feature-length motion picture (defined as over 40 minutes) produced outside the United States of America with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.”</p>

      <p>Lionheart has just under 12 minutes of dialogue that is in the Igbo language native to Southeastern Nigeria, while the rest of the 94-minute picture is in English.</p>
      <p>The film is not excluded from entering other Oscar categories, including consideration for the best picture.</p>
      <h4>Reactions</h4>
      <p>Hollywood director, Ava DuVernay, and many others have argued that English is Nigeria’s official language.</p>
      <p>In its attempt to encourage foreign language films, he asked if the Academy is not penalising international filmmakers operating in their country’s most commonly spoken language.</p>
      <p>Nnaji, who also stars in the film, took to Twitter Monday night to defend her movie.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on Twitter, the reactions from Nigerians and foreigners are alike.</p>
      <p>They criticise the Academy’s decision as well as pointing out Nigeria’s obvious historical colonial reasons for having English as a national language.</p>
      <p>The founder of The Black List, Franklin Leonard, said, “Colonialism really is a bi..h.”</p>
