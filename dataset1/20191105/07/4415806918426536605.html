      <p>A man has been killed in a shooting in Co Meath last night.</p>
      <p>The scene in Bettystown is sealed off pending a technical examination.</p>
      <p>The man was shot outside his home in the Castlemartin Estate in Bettystown at around 11.40pm.</p>
      <p>The man, 39, received a number of gunshot wounds and was removed by Ambulance to Our lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead shortly before 1am this morning.</p>
      <p>It is believed the killing may be linked to an ongoing feud in Drogheda.</p>
      <p>The scene is being preserved for a technical examination and Gardaí in Laytown are appealing for witnesses.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said a small van was found on fire at Eastham Rd, Bettystown, Co Meath shortly after the shooting.</p>
      <p>That scene is also preserved pending an examination by Garda Crime Scene Examiners.</p>
      <p>Investigating Gardaí are anxious to hear from road users with camera footage who were in the area at the time of shooting.</p>
      <p>They are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this incident or who may have information to contact the incident room at Ashbourne Garda Station on 01-801 0600, the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station.</p>
