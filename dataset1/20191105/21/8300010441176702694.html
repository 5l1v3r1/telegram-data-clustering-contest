      <p>It's Election Day in Los Angeles County and four cities in the San Gabriel Valley are asking voters to raise the sales tax.<br/><br/>Voters in <b>Monrovia, Irwindale, Sierra Madre</b> and <b>South Pasadena </b>are deciding whether to raise the sales tax to 10.25%, the state's limit.<br/><br/>The increase would fund public services and parks, but not everyone is sold on the idea.<br/><br/>"The funds...are not well directed, it's not defined." said Karen Mitchell, a small-business owner.<br/><br/>Measure K in Monrovia could raise $4.5 million annually for the city. Although the community center near the city's downtown would benefit with a face-lift expected to exceed $6 million, Mitchell thinks other spending plans are all over the place.<br/><br/>"I feel like this is kind of a preemptive measure and I don't know if that really works for me," Mitchell said.<br/><br/>Other Monrovia residents feel differently.<br/><br/>"I think it's beneficial. With the cost of everything going up - the city is no exception," said Monrovia resident, Cindy Bernhardt.<br/><br/>Voters in <b>Pico Rivera, La Habra Heights, Rancho Palos Verdes, San Marino </b>and <b>Hermosa Beach </b>will be voting on city council members.<br/><br/>In <b>Hermosa Beach </b>Measure H aims to raise the hotel bed tax to 14%.<br/><br/>In <b>Rancho Palos Verdes</b>, Measure B would enact a $15-an-hour minimum wage for hospitality workers.<br/><br/>"People need to vote one way or the other. I hear people sitting around complaining. 'Well did you vote? No. Then you don't have anything to say,'" said Doug Bernhardt of Monrovia.<br/><br/>Without any major statewide races, turn out is expected to be low. Polls close at 8 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
