【新光金無限之戰3】為了一個女人　大股東洪文棟獨子也不爽吳東進
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 劉曉霞
8月底，新光金悄悄公告法人董事，以及旗下新光人壽的董事變更。原先新光三越百貨董事長吳東興在新光金的董事席次，改由他的長子、新光三越開發董座吳昕達接任；至於已逝新光金大股東洪文棟在新壽的董事遺缺，也在延宕近一年後，改由洪文棟姪子洪士鈞接任。



兩起董監變更公告，表面上看起來平淡無奇，背後卻暗潮洶湧。本刊調查，新光金第二大股東新光三越董事長吳東興，以及另一大股東洪士琪已悄悄加碼持股，讓新光金董座吳東進大為緊張，也啟動買股，明年的改選大戰逐漸加溫。
「洪文棟獨子洪士琪一直想進新壽董事會，吳東進最後改派洪文棟姪兒洪士鈞，也讓洪士琪不願支持吳東進，都讓老大相當擔憂。」吳家親友解釋，「由於洪士琪和吳東進長女吳欣盈屢有意見衝突，吳東進為護女，才改派洪士鈞。」
過去吳東進的長女吳欣盈美式作風直率，屢屢和其他二大股東家族成員不合。洪士琪就曾在新光金董事會上提議，要撤換吳欣盈的新壽副總職位，提案還得到另一位董事林伯翰覆議，洪、林兩人並要求吳欣盈退出新光金董事會。
為避免衝突擴大，三大家族在上屆股東會改選董監前協調，各退一步，吳欣盈、洪士琪退出新光金董事會，改由洪文棟和吳東進次女吳欣儒進入，直到去年6月，洪士琪才重新頂替洪文棟位置，進入新光金董事會。

Wu family and friends explained, ""Because Hong Shiqi and Wu Dongjin's eldest daughter Wu Xinying There have been frequent conflicts of opinion. When Wu Dongjin was a nurse, he was sent to Hong Shizhen.""
