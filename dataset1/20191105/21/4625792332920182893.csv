A Louisiana woman has been arrested after allegedly writing phony medical notes for students so they could cut class.
Belinda Fondren, 52, was arrested on a charge of filing or maintaining false public records for the alleged racket.
Police say that Fondren, who previously worked for a local physician, had written and sold at least 14 fake notes to two students for $20 apiece — a total of $280 — before her scheme was foiled.
The medical clinic employee’s ability to write fake notes was reportedly common knowledge among students at Evans High School.
The doctor whose name appeared on the notes began receiving calls from the Vernon Parish School Board about the absences and pointed out that neither he nor anyone in his office had signed off on the absences. According to Vernon Parish Sheriff Sam Craft, Fondren had worked in a clerical position at the medical clinic.
Fondren, whose daughter attends the high school, had her bond set at $15,000.
