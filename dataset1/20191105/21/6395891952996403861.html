      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts judge says the state's ban on the sale of vaping products can't be enforced on medical marijuana products.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled Tuesday that marijuana card holders seeking to purchase marijuana vaping products should be exempt from the four-month ban.</p>
      <p>He says the ban as written undermines the state's medical marijuana law.</p>
      <p>A group representing medical marijuana patients argues only the state Cannabis Control Commission can regulate marijuana products.</p>
      <p>Republican Gov. Charlie Baker issued the emergency ban in September in response to lung illnesses attributed to use of e-cigarette products.</p>
      <p>Wilkins says the medical marijuana exemption must take effect by next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The cannabis commission meets Thursday and could discuss issuing its own ban on marijuana vaping products.</p>
      <p>The vaping industry is also challenging the broader ban in court.</p>
