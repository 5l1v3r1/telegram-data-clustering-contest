      <p>U.S. stocks took a breather on Tuesday, weighed down partially by losses in healthcare stocks, after a rally driven by hopes of a trade truce between Washington and Beijing propelled the three main indexes to record highs a day earlier.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: The benchmark S&amp;P 500 edged lower on Tuesday, as investors paused in the wake of a rally buoyed by hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China that sent the three main U.S. stock indexes to record highs in the previous session.</p>
      <p>Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.52 points, or 0.11per cent, to 27,492.63, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.64 points, or 0.12per cent, to 3,074.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.48 points, or 0.02per cent, to 8,434.68.</p>
