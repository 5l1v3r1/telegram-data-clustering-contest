【新光金無限之戰5】董監改選提前開打　新光金股價驚驚漲
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 劉曉霞, 董孟航
新光金明年改選董監事，內部大股東積極加碼持股，也推動新光金股價持續走揚，新光金股價從8月底起截至10月底，漲幅已達5％。不只新光金明年有董監改選題材，彰銀、永豐金也因經營權之爭，近來股價表現亮眼，彰銀更是一度站上每股24元，創下8年來的新高。



攤開新光金年報，前十大股東中可分成三大勢力，吳東進透過新光醫院、新光海洋持股約6％，再來就是吳東興透過新光三越、個人持有的東興投資持股逾4％，另外一派就是由老三、台新金董座吳東亮掌握的新勝、王田毛紡、永光等新光金主要控股公司，總計持股逾6％。
據股市觀測站10月底資料，吳東進掌控的吳火獅文教基金會、吳東進基金會、新誠投資等控股公司，光是9月就較8月增加持股850多張；吳東興旗下的新光三越和東興投資，更是一個月內就砸下約2.5億元，大買新光金達2.62萬張。
根據了解，不僅吳東進、吳東興積極加碼持股，就連新光金第三大股東新勝也罕見地增加持股近9,000張，成為另一派蠢蠢欲動的勢力。觀察新光金股價可發現，新光金明顯有買盤加持，股價從八月迄今，漲幅已達5％。
明年有董監改選題材的金融股還有彰銀、永豐金等，其中台新金併購彰銀案已長達14年迄今未解，今年彰銀第二大民股大股東、「殯葬天王」龍巖集團總裁李世聰宣布不玩了之後，公股、民股積極買股，推升彰銀股價持續飆高，一度站上每股24元，創下8年來的新高。
弊案纏身的永豐金，明年也將改選董監，市場傳言，寶佳集團虎視眈眈有意插旗永豐金，讓大股東何家持續加碼永豐金持股，今年1到9月總計加碼5.19萬張，推升股價走揚，一度站上每股13元4年來新高價。
