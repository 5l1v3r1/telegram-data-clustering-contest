        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Bloemfontein Celtic 3-1 Highlands Park</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 05 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Dr. Petrus Molemela Stadium</p>
      <p>Ndumiso Mabena and Menzi Masuku came off the bench and found the back of the net as Bloemfontein Celtic defeated Highlands Park 3-1 in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Owen Da Gama rang the changes following the weekend's Telkom Knockout encounter as Peter Shalulile, Sifiso Mbhele and Mothobi Mvala returned to the line-up</p>
      <p>After a quiet opening to the half, Celtic found the opening goal on 19 minutes through Sera Motebang, who bagged his third goal of the campaign.</p>
      <p>It was no surprise to see Highlands get off to the slower start as they had played 120 minutes against Maritzburg United five days ago, while the visitors had a full week to prepare for the clash.</p>
      <p>However, the MTN8 finalists were back on level terms just before the halftime break as the league's top scorer Shalulile netted his seventh goal of the season.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to claw their way back into the clash, Lehlohonolo Seema threw on Mabena and Masuku on the hour mark, while Highlands introduced Rodney Ramagalela.</p>
      <p>As the half went on, it was Celtic's substitutes that proved fruitful as Mabena fired past Thela Ngobeni with nine minutes remaining in the contest.</p>
      <p>The win was sealed moments later when fellow substitute Masuku bagged his first goal of the season from the penalty spot as Celtic move up to ninth spot.</p>
      <p>
