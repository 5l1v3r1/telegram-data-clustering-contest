      <p>BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia said on Tuesday it would speed social investment of $391.6 million earmarked for southwestern Cauca province, where indigenous communities and political candidates have been recent targets for violence by crime gangs and dissident rebels.</p>
      <p>The spending will include subsidies for poor families, road construction, help for economic projects and improvements in health coverage, education and nutrition.</p>
      <p>Twelve people have been killed in two attacks by armed groups in the province over the past week, including seven members of indigenous communities.</p>
      <p>In September, mayoral candidate Karina Garcia was killed along with five others in the town of Suarez.</p>
      <p>“The common enemy is drug trafficking and that’s why the idea is to fight drug trafficking not just with closer security but also socially,” Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos told journalists.</p>
      <p>President Ivan Duque last week ordered the armed forces to send 2,500 personnel as reinforcements to the province, a hub for the production and transport of coca and marijuana, joining the 8,000 soldiers already stationed there.</p>
      <p>Some communities in Cauca, where the indigenous population numbers 300,000, oppose the increase in the military presence within their territory and have demanded more social spending.</p>
      <p>Their communities are frequently targeted - by crime gangs, the National Liberation Army rebel group and guerrilla fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who refused to demobilize under a 2016 peace deal - for resisting drug trafficking and illegal mining within ancestral lands</p>
      <p>Figures from the United Nations show that some 50 killings have taken place in indigenous territory in Colombia so far this year.</p>
