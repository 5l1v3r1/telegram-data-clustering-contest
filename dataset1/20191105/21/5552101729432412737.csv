【子涵名醫低調戀4】李進良受名醫請託　子涵罩杯大躍進
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 李育材
李光輝認為，連千毅根本是利用翁子涵炒作知名度、蹭翁的名氣，塑造他身邊有許多美女圍繞的虛榮感。他說，翁曾因資金需求，向他借款50萬元，雖然當時2人是情侶，但她還開立本票給他抵押，認為翁很有骨氣，絕對不是為了錢就會出賣靈魂的人。



李光輝並說，他與翁子涵分手後，翁為了讓自己的星途更順遂，曾要他幫忙介紹醫美診所，他因此親自打電話給好友李進良，介紹她到李的醫美診所隆乳。
電話裡他除了請李進良多關照，也拜託李20萬元手術費能分期，讓翁沒有後顧之憂，翁為此除了傳訊息向李光輝致謝，也在手術完成後，自拍隆乳成果給李向他表示感謝。
本刊調查，李光輝是英國雪菲爾大學精神醫學博士，35歲時獲得瑞士年輕科學家獎，擔任過台北監獄性侵害犯治療計畫主持人、國防醫學院兼任助理教授、國軍北投醫院成人精神科主任醫師。








本刊致電翁子涵手機，接通後，記者表明身分，電話那頭完全無人回應。本刊再致電經紀公司，經紀公司表示，不想對相關問題多作回應。
