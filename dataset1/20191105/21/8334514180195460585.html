      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1% on Tuesday on hopes for a U.S.-China trade agreement and optimism that Washington could roll back some tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

      <p>Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 83 cents, or 1.3%, to settle at $62.96 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures ended 69 cents, or 1.2%, higher at $57.23 a barrel.</p>
      <p>China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September as part of a so-called Phase 1 deal, which would ease the economic impact of the trade dispute between the world’s two biggest oil consumers.</p>
      <p>“While such a development could accommodate a signing of a Phase 1 deal that would allow for a further increase in risk acceptance and hence, bullish spillover from the equities and into the oil complex, a major long term agreement still appears elusive well into next year,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a report.</p>
      <p>OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the oil market outlook for 2020 may be brighter than previously forecast, appearing to downplay any need for deeper production cuts.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia meet in December. The so-called OPEC+ alliance has since January cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Iran’s oil minister on Monday said he expects further production cuts to be agreed in December.</p>
      <p>OPEC also said it would supply a diminishing amount of oil in the next five years as output increases from U.S. shale deposits and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>OPEC’s production of crude oil and other liquids is expected to decline to 32.8 million bpd by 2024, the group said in its 2019 World Oil Outlook.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Asia’s oil demand growth is expected to more than double to 815,000 bpd in 2020, the head of energy consulting firm FGE said on.</p>
      <p>In the United States, crude inventories rose 4.3 million barrels last week to 440.5 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed late Tuesday, nearly triple analysts’ forecasts for a 1.5 million-barrel build.</p>
      <p>Official U.S. government data is due to be released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Oil also drew support from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut last week, weakness in the dollar and improved U.S. jobs growth in October, analysts said.</p>
      <p>“We believe that the strength in oil prices will be short-lived, given the scale of the surplus that is expected over the 1H20,” ING analyst Warren Patterson said, referring to the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>“The risk to this view is if OPEC+ surprises the market in December by announcing even deeper than expected cuts for 2020.”</p>
