【新光金無限之戰4】最美董娘也入戰局　讓吳東進如坐針氈
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 劉曉霞, 陳俊銘
有「最美董娘」稱號的台新金董娘彭雪芬今年代夫出征，拿下家族控股公司新勝、永光、允德、王田毛紡，新勝、永光和王田毛紡同時也是新光金大股東，讓新光金董座、吳家老大吳東進相當擔憂。



橫跨金融、紡織、食品、瓦斯、百貨的新光集團，是由吳金龍、吳火獅、吳金虎三兄弟和洪萬傳及林登山共同投資建立，1986年，吳火獅因心臟病發猝逝，改由大家長吳桂蘭主持大局。
吳桂蘭2016年過世後，新光內部權力就擺不平，她遺留新勝、台灣新光實業等主要新光金控股公司董座，隔年這幾家公司相繼改選，引發吳東進和原始大股東洪文棟大戰，最後洪文棟拿下新勝，新光三越董事長吳東興掌控新實。
未料，洪文棟去年11月過世，再次引發新勝、王田毛紡等控股公司的董座搶奪大戰，吳東進對了洪文棟的獨子洪士琪，最後在吳家老臣出面斡旋，三大家族協調後，由「最美董娘」台新金董座夫人彭雪芬接掌。
今年7月新勝再改選董監事，吳東亮聯手老四吳東昇、堂哥吳東興，彭雪芬得已續任董事長。「老三（吳東亮）、老四（吳東昇）在家族實力擴張，讓老大（吳東進）備感威脅，才引發新光三越的奪權事件。」知情人士說。
