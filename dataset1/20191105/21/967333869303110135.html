      <p>According to Marina Bokyo, a customs spokesperson in eastern Siberia, the woman seemed “nervous and suspicious” as she “unnaturally placed one foot in front of the other,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50301283">BBC reported</a>. An investigation by customs officials revealed that the woman had taped eight gold discs to the soles of her feet, which set off a metal detector when she walked through it.</p>
      <blockquote>"The ingots had been attached to the insoles of her shoes with duct tape," an official Tuesday <a href="http://dvtu.customs.ru/news/document/213151">statement</a> by customs officials says, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/russian-caught-trying-to-smuggle-2kg-of-gold-in-her-shoes-12065384">AFP reported.</a></blockquote>
      <p>A criminal case was opened against the woman, who is believed to have been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910301077181089-police-ringleader-smuggling-victims-uk/">smuggling</a> the gold for a Chinese citizen in exchange for cash. The woman now faces up to seven years in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077204093-us-navy-officer-wife-charged-in-plot-to-smuggle-boats-to-china---justice-department/">prison</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Officials have frequently stopped Russians from attempting to smuggle gold into China over the past year, Bokyo told AFP. </blockquote>
      <p>Another Russian national was caught at Zabaikalsk in August attempting to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910311077188053-swedish-police-spooked-by-drug-dealing-people-smuggling-nigerian-voodoo-mafia/">smuggle</a> about 10 golden bars across the border under her sneaker insoles.</p>
