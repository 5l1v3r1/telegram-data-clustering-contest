      <p>Tottenham striker Harry Kane says his side are ready to follow the protocol if they suffer racist abuse at Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Spurs were subjected to abuse last time they played in Belgrade in 2014 and the Champions League Group B clash is at Rajko Mitic Stadium, where Serbia fans were found guilty of racism against Portugal in their game last month.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Red Star fans were banned from attending the reverse fixture a fortnight ago by UEFA after they were found guilty of racism during a qualifying round match in Finland in July.</p>
      <p>Kane has recent experience of the three-step process following the shameful scenes in Bulgaria last month, where England were close to coming off the pitch in Sofia after some abhorrent abuse.</p>
      <p>Red Star are keen to avoid any issues, posting a video on their Instagram page, while their coach Vladan Milojevic promised there would be no issues.</p>
      <p>Kane is hoping he is not at the centre of a storm again, but says the club are ready if the worst happens.</p>
      <p>“Like I said before that game (in Sofia), hopefully it doesn’t happen and we play a football match.</p>

      <p>“If it does happen then obviously there’s a protocol in place like there was in Sofia, and as players we follow that.”</p>
      <p>Even if there is no racism, Spurs will be subjected to an intense atmosphere at the Rajko Mitic Stadium, a place where Liverpool floundered last season.</p>
      <p>The Reds, who went on to win the competition, lost 2-0 and Kane is keen to avoid becoming another high-profile Premier League scalp.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully not,” he said. “Hopefully we can win tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard from a few players that the atmosphere will be very tough, very hostile.</p>
      <p>“We have to focus on ourselves and do everything in our power to win the game. We have to make sure we’re ready.</p>
      <p>“Three points puts us in a great position.”</p>
