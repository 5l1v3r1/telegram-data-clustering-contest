AB6IX member Daehwi recently spoke about his thoughts on malicious comments whilst chatting to fans on Vlive.




“I'm just okay with what you guys say, even if it's good or bad, I go I live with it. And for those who talk bad about me, it's going to come back to you soon.”

Fans of Daehwi praised his bold response to hate comments:

We stan a sassy king!


Daehwi said karma is a b*tch so get a life instead of hating.


I wish all idols were so positive thinking.


Couldn’t have said it better!


He has a strong mentality.
