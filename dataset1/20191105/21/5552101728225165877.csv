【豪門爆姦情6】沒拿過元祖一毛錢　安晨妤靠自己年收1.8億元
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 娛樂組, 攝影組
歌手兼作家安晨妤是個成功網路電商企業家，19歲就嗅到網路商機，後獨資成立公司「開店123」，協助過不少藝人，也曾幫不少品牌架設官網、進行網路行銷，一年約賺進1.8億元，安晨妤可說是個非常有生意頭腦的人。



之後她又相中兒童市場，不但在台北市仁愛路地段一級戰區，砸千萬開立貴婦醫美診所，並開設讓小孩長高的診所，顧名思義就是要照顧貴婦外，也要照顧小孩、讓下一代長得又高又大。








努力賺錢的安晨妤，曾接受媒體訪問說，開公司以來從沒拿老公一毛錢，並說原本在認識老公前，就是獨身主義，無暇理會老公邀約，直到張劭緯以討論網路商務生意為由，才促成第一次的約會。安晨妤稱自己就是豪門，無需依靠任何人，並鼓勵女生們把自己變成豪門，比嫁入豪門實際的多。


今年7月，張母曾到安晨妤的公司盤問公司財務狀況。（讀者提供）

而張劭緯雖掛著「元祖小開」的名號，但實際上卻沒有外界想像的風光。據了解，他出門皆搭小黃，沒有自購車。先前安晨妤發片，張劭緯對外誇說豪砸3千萬幫老婆圓夢，而事實上卻是安晨妤自己出資發片，因顧及老公的面子，而對外如此說。

[Grandfather’s affair 6] Didn’t take Yuanzu’s dime An Chen’s annual income of 180 million yuan

Singer and writer An Chenxi is a successful online e-commerce entrepreneur. At the age of 19, he sniffed online business opportunities. After that, he founded the company ""Opening Shop 123"" and assisted many artists. He also helped many brands set up official websites and networks. Road marketing, earning about 180 million yuan a year, An Chenxi can be said to be a very business-minded person.



After that, she was in the children's market. Not only in the first-class theater in Renai Road, Taipei, but also opened a hospital for women and women, and opened a clinic for children to grow up. As the name suggests, it is to take care of the ladies and take care of the children. Let the next generation grow taller and bigger.








An Chenxi, who has worked hard to make money, once said that she has never taken her husband’s dime since she opened the company. She said that she had been single-minded before she knew her husband, and she had no reason to invite her husband until Zhang Weiwei discussed online business. Only then, the first date was promoted. An Chen said that he is a giant, no need to rely on anyone, and encourage girls to turn themselves into wealthy, more than actually married to the giants.


In July of this year, Zhang Mu went to An Chenyi's company to question the company's financial situation. (provided by the reader)

Although Zhang Weiwei hangs the name of ""Yuanzu Xiaokai"", in reality, there is no such thing as the imagination. It is understood that he went out to take a small yellow, did not buy a car. Previously, An Chen was released, and Zhang Yiwei exaggerated that he had a dream of 30 million gangs of wives, but in fact it was An Chen 妤 himself who contributed the film, because of the husband’s face, and said so.
