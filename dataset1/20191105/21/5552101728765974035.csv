過往演藝圈極少數有被捕捉到隨地大小便的例子，但國內外仍有幾例重大事件，除了像高富帥周予天一樣毫無包袱地解放，更有人因此喪命。



劉燁與好友酒過三巡後散會，醉醺醺的他走路東倒西歪，在路邊撒尿完後，才上車離去，網友批評沒素質，也有粉絲護航「他只是去摘樹葉」。








對岸鋼琴王子李雲迪開車被拍到路邊臨停，下車走到花壇，先確定四周無人，竟拉下褲子小解，結束後快速上車離開，被網友批評「小王子形象崩塌」。
韓國女星韓智星與老公喝酒後駕車，行駛在高速公路上，老公尿急，於是她將車停在路中間，讓他去路邊花壇解放，而韓智星疑似下車嘔吐遭後方計程車撞死。

★《鏡週刊》關心您：未滿18歲禁止飲酒，飲酒過量害人害己，酒後不開車，安全有保障。
