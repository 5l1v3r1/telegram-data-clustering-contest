安晨妤於生日當天，看到老公搞外遇的不雅照，相當痛心。安母接受訪問，直指元祖母子的5大罪狀，痛批女婿「搞外遇」「不照顧小孩」「拿小孩錢」！而張母知道後，還「縱容兒子」、並曾到女兒公司盤查生意狀況，「行為不可理喻」！



安母表示，「女兒是開店123的執行長，得知不倫戀後，發現對方竟是知名食品界的千金邱威樺，還是她的客戶之一，非常生氣，知道後她就取消合作關係。」氣憤張劭緯「吃窩邊草」，十分不可取。

安母非常心疼女兒找錯老公、誤入一段不美滿的婚姻，痛批女婿是個「渣男」！安母說「以前對他的印象是乖乖型、蠻有禮貌的，完全看不出來是這種人。」
安母表示，女兒今年8月飛上海，除了要過父親節、也計畫與家人一起慶生，沒想到卻遭張家人冷漠對待，「我覺得很奇怪，我女兒生日竟然都沒有人幫她過，女婿消失不見，而且張家人還不讓我女兒見小孩，我們就覺得事情不太對勁。」

安母同時也向本刊指控，女婿不但沒就近照顧小孩，甚至連小孩的零用錢也拿走，包括安晨妤給兒子的人民幣2萬元（約新台幣9萬元），和女兒的人民幣1500元人民幣（約新台幣6500元）走秀演出費。

除了責備女婿之外，安母也痛批張母，「她也不管兒子的行為，這不就是縱容嗎？」安母並說，張母曾頤指氣使到女兒的公司大鬧，甚至挑明問員工「這公司賺錢嗎」「賺多少錢」等，十分無禮和不尊重人，令她相當不滿。

[Grandfather bursts of love 4] rich second generation to eat Wobian grass, mother-in-law pains, Yuan grandmother, 5 major crimes
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by Entertainment Group, Photography Group
On the birthday of An Chen, I saw the indecent photos of my husband’s affair. I was very sad. Anmu accepted the visit and pointed to the five major crimes of Yuan’s grandmother, and criticized the son-in-law for “making an affair”, “not taking care of children” and “taking children’s money”! After Zhang Mu knew it, she also ""indulged her son"" and went to her daughter company to check the business situation. ""The behavior is unreasonable!""



Anmu said, ""Daughter is the CEO of the store 123. After learning about the incomprehensible love, she found that the other party was a well-known food industry, Qiu Weihua, or one of her clients. She was very angry. After she knew it, she canceled the partnership."" It is highly undesirable for Zhang Weiwei to ""eat the grass in the nest"".


In July of this year, Zhang Mu went to An Chenyi's company to question the company's financial situation. (provided by the reader)

Anmu is very distressed by her daughter looking for the wrong husband, straying into a bad marriage, and criticizing the son-in-law is a ""slag man""! Anmu said, ""The impression he had before was sly and polite. I can’t see it at all.""
Anmu said that her daughter flew to Shanghai in August this year. In addition to her father's day, she planned to celebrate with her family. I didn't expect it to be treated indifferently by Zhang's family. ""I feel very strange. No one helped my daughter's birthday."" The son-in-law disappeared, and the family did not let my daughter see the child. We felt that things were not quite right.""


Qiu Weihua's petite looks are sweet and often promote his own products on Facebook. (Reflected from Qiu Weihua Facebook)

Anmu also accused the journal that the son-in-law not only took care of the children nearby, but even took away the children’s pocket money, including An Chen’s RMB 20,000 to his son (about NT$90,000) and his daughter’s RMB. 1,500 yuan (about NT$6,500) catwalk performance fee.


Zhang Yiwei uploaded the back photo of An Chenxi on Facebook last year and wrote: ""This is the woman I have been holding for a lifetime. It used to be, now and in the future."" (Reviewed from Zhang Weiwei's Facebook)

In addition to blaming the son-in-law, Anmu also criticized Zhang Mu. ""She doesn't care about her son's behavior. Isn't that just connivance?"" Anmu said that Zhang Mu had once made a fuss about her daughter's company, and even asked the staff. ""Is this company making money?"" ""How much money to earn"", etc., is very rude and disrespectful, making her quite dissatisfied.
