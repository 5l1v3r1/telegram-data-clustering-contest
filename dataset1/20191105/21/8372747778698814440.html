      <p>The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to pass the PACT Act on Tuesday, which will make animal cruelty a federal felony.</p>
      <p>The "Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act" was introduced by Congressmen Vern Buchanan and Ted Deutch. The House voted to pass the act on Oct. 23.</p>
      <p>“This is a milestone for pet owners and animal lovers across the country,” Buchanan said. “For the first time, a national law has been passed by Congress to protect animals from cruelty and abuse.”</p>
      <p>The act specifically bans crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impaling or otherwise subjecting animals to serious bodily harm.</p>
      <p>"This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation to bring some compassion to our animal laws," Deutch said.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Congress passed legislation making it illegal to create and distribute so-called "animal crush videos" that showed people brutally killing and torturing animals. The underlying acts themselves are still legal under federal law.</p>
      <p>The PACT Act aims to close those loopholes.</p>
      <p>“The torture of innocent animals is abhorrent and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,” Buchanan said. “Protecting animals from cruelty is a top priority for me and I’m proud to work with Congressman Deutch on this important issue.”</p>
      <p>President Trump is expected to sign the act in the near future, according to a press release from Congressman Buchanan.</p>
