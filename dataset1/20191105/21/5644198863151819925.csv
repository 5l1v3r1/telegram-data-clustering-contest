Trade-sensitive chipmakers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp , rose between 0.6per cent and 1.1per cent in premarket trading. U.S.-listed Chinese stocks also looked set to extend another session of gains.
Gathering optimism around the resolution of the trade war, along with a largely better-than-expected third-quarter earnings season and an upbeat October jobs report have spurred a Wall Street rally this month.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs for the second consecutive session on Monday, while the Dow Jones hit a record high for the first time since July.
Generic drugmaker Mylan NV rose 1.9per cent after beating Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit, benefiting from drug launches such as Wixela and Fulphila.
Tapestry Inc was up 2.5per cent as it also beat quarterly profit estimates on strong demand for its high-margin Coach handbags and apparel in China and Europe.
Investor attention now shifts to the ISM's services report, which is expected to show a reading of 53.5 in October, up from 52.6 in September. The report is due at 10 a.m. ET.
At 7:37 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 71 points, or 0.26per cent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 6.25 points, or 0.2per cent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 20.5 points, or 0.25per cent.
Uber Technologies Inc fell 5.8per cent after the ride-hailing service posted a wider third-quarter loss as it tried to outspend competitors through discounts.
Shares of Xerox Holdings Corp were up 5.3per cent after the photocopier maker said it would sell its 25per cent stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings , for US$2.3 billion.
