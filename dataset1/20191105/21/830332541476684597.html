      <p>EDGERTON, Wis. - A 24-year-old man from Belvidere, Illinois was killed early Tuesday morning when a tractor ran over him in Rock County.</p>
      <p>First responders were sent to a field along the 7500 block of N. Fox Road around 1:15 a.m., where the man had been riding in a farm tractor, according to Rock County Sheriff Troy Knudson. </p>
      <p>An initial investigation indicates an 18-year-old Illinois man was driving the tractor when the victim attempted to get out of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Authorities believe the victim slipped on a mud-covered ladder and fell to the ground where he was struck by the rear tire of the tractor.</p>
      <p>Farm workers on scene called for help and performed CPR until first responders arrived, Knudson said.</p>
      <p>The identity of the victim will be released at a later time.</p>
