「殺豬盤」啟動？山西柳林首富被判死緩 罰沒百億

05 Nov 2019, 21:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】日前山西當局以「打黑除惡」為名，將柳林首富陳鴻志判處死緩和巨額罰金。在中共搶劫私產填補政府財政的大背景下，網民熱評中共「殺豬盤」啟動，重慶「唱紅打黑」模式將擴展全國。
11月5日，中共山西長治市中級法院對山西煤老闆陳鴻志等78人「犯組織、領導、參加黑社會性質組織罪等罪行」進行公開宣判。其中陳鴻志被指控17宗罪，被執行死刑，緩期二年執行。高海平等其他人員，分別被判處無期徒刑和時間不等的有期徒刑。
另外，陳鴻志旗下的山西凌志能源投資集團有限公司，以及凌志能源的全資子公司柳林縣孟門運銷有限公司被判處罰金共40.4億元。
而據早前官媒披露，陳鴻志去年7月被抓後，涉案財物被扣押、查封、凍結，初步評估約78.4億元。
官媒還說，陳鴻志擁有的凌志能源總資產達百億。也就是說，經過這一系列罰沒資產，陳鴻志可能已經傾家蕩產。
陳鴻志被抓後，官媒極力渲染其團伙如何橫行不法，並稱他曾當眾打柳林前縣委書記王寧一個耳光。不過輿論認為，中共是中國最大的「黑社會組織」，陳鴻志得以橫行肯定有官員做後台。如今陳鴻志被判死緩，罰沒過百億，網友紛紛表示，這是現代版的「打土豪分田地」，認為中共各級政府財政緊張，當年重慶「打黑」搶劫私企財產的模式已蔓延到全國。
有網民留言稱，「若干年後，房地產商也會是這樣的下場」，「他們（中共）會不會瘋狂到去抓李嘉誠」。還有網友認為搶私企不如加緊抓貪官：「如此斂財太慢了，打掉一個海口市委書記張琦就有2600億了。所以還是反貪效率高。」



目前中國經濟加速下滑，房地產泡沫危機導致中共土地財政受損，政府財政嚴重不足。當局正在加緊控制私企財產，包括向民企派駐官員、接管民企財務等等。其中，以反腐或其它罪名抓捕企業家並沒收財產，被指是中共斂財最快捷的方式。
早前，安邦、明天系、華信能源等巨頭已接連被官方機構「接管」。近日，中共國務院發文鼓勵員工「舉報」所在公司的「犯罪行為」，輿論擔憂中共可能發動又一場政治運動，為搶劫私產、實施「公私合營」做準備。
在此背景下，中共「打土豪分田地」的運動也已延伸到香港。9月，港府發文強徵784幅私人土地，總面積約68公頃。香港幾家房地產巨頭被迫將大幅土地「捐獻」或低價「出售」給政府。

""Pig pig"" started? Shanxi Liulin’s richest man was sentenced to death

05 Nov 2019, 21:17

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Recently, the Shanxi authorities sentenced Liu Lin, the richest man in Liulin, to a murder and a huge fine in the name of ""black and evil."" Under the background of the CCP’s looting of private property to fill the government’s finances, netizens’ hot criticism of the CCP’s “killing pigs” was launched, and Chongqing’s “singing red and black” model will be extended nationwide.
On November 5th, the Intermediate People's Court of Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, publicly pronounced 78 people including Shanxi coal boss Chen Hongzhi, who committed crimes such as organizing, leading, and participating in organized crimes. Among them, Chen Hongzhi was accused of 17 counts of crimes and was executed and suspended for two years. Other members of Gao Haiping were sentenced to life imprisonment and life imprisonment ranging from time to time.
In addition, Chen Hongzhi's Shanxi Lingzhi Energy Investment Group Co., Ltd. and Lingzhi Energy's wholly-owned subsidiary Liulin County Mengmen Transportation and Marketing Co., Ltd. were fined 4.04 billion yuan.
According to earlier official media reports, after Chen Hongzhi was arrested in July last year, the property involved was detained, sealed up, and frozen, with an initial assessment of about 7.84 billion yuan.
The official media also said that the total assets of Lexus Energy owned by Chen Hongzhi amounted to 10 billion. In other words, after this series of fines and penalties, Chen Hongzhi may have gone bankrupt.
After Chen Hongzhi was arrested, the official media tried to show how his gang was rampant, and said that he had slap in the face of Wang Lin, the county party secretary of Liulin. However, public opinion believes that the CCP is China's largest ""black organization"", and Chen Hongzhi is sure to have officials to do the back office. Now Chen Hongzhi has been sentenced to death, and the penalty has not exceeded 10 billion. Netizens have said that this is a modern version of the ""land-to-earth field"". He believes that the government of all levels of the CCP is financially nervous. The model of ""blackening"" looting private property in Chongqing has spread to the whole country.
Some netizens commented that ""a few years later, real estate developers will end up like this."" ""Will they (the CCP) go crazy to catch Li Ka-shing."" Some netizens think that it is better to rush to catch corrupt officials than to grab private companies: ""It is too slow to collect money. Zhang Qi, a secretary of Haikou Municipal Party Committee, has 260 billion yuan. So it is still highly effective in fighting corruption.""



At present, China's economy is accelerating, and the real estate bubble crisis has caused the CCP's land finance to be damaged, and the government's finances are seriously inadequate. The authorities are stepping up control over the property of private companies, including sending officials to private enterprises, taking over the finances of private enterprises, and so on. Among them, arresting entrepreneurs and confiscating property on the basis of anti-corruption or other crimes is accused of being the fastest way for the CCP to collect money.
Earlier, giants such as Anbang, Tomorrow, and Huaxin Energy were successively taken over by official agencies. Recently, the State Council issued a document encouraging employees to ""report"" the company's ""criminal behavior"". Public opinion is concerned that the CCP may launch another political campaign to prepare for the looting of private property and the implementation of ""public-private partnerships.""
In this context, the CCP's campaign to ""make local land and land"" has also extended to Hong Kong. In September, the Hong Kong Government issued a strong 784 private land with a total area of about 68 hectares. Several real estate giants in Hong Kong were forced to ""sell"" or ""sell"" large-scale land to the government.
