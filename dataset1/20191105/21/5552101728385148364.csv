潤寅楊文虎及王音之夫婦詐貸百億潛逃出境，花1200萬天價找來曾任法官的律師黃呈熹滅證善後。黃呈熹除了具有法官經歷，妻子是現任檢察官外，詭異的是，他曾和一件命案有牽扯。



2016年3月，已婚的黃呈熹和一名曾任書記官的43歲女子跟團同遊捷克及奧地利，期間二人因不明原因在旅館大吵一架，驚擾不少同團團員，當晚該女負氣隻身離開旅館，徹夜未歸。

黃呈熹向台灣領隊回報後，眾人一同在知名觀光小鎮庫倫洛夫四處尋找未果，轉向當地警方報案，事發5天後，仍覓尋不著書記官下落時，黃呈熹返回台灣後，直到第9天，捷克警方在鎮上河邊尋獲該女遺體，死因成謎。
死者父母接獲捷克警方通報，傷心欲絕，面對寶貝女兒好端端地跟著黃呈熹出國10天旅遊，卻客死他鄉，非常不諒解。究竟黃呈熹身為人夫，為何帶著未婚女子出國？女前書記官之死是否有隱情？都曾引起司法圈熱議。
