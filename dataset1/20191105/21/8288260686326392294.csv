Another viewer wrote: ""Owen does not look 40.""
Owen had a great cash-builder round, securing a solid £8000 - however he was not tempted by The Beast's high offer of £35k.
The head-to-head round was tight, but Owen managed to make it through to the final chase.
 
However, it wasn't meant to be as Mark won the round with three seconds to go.
