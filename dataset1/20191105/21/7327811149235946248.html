      <p>Musician Shaggy will play Sebastian the crab. His experience performing live is vital for the new version of "The Little Mermaid."</p>
      <p>"I've done these kinds of live situations so I don't know if there's a nervousness or craziness that's supposed to be, I'm just really excited and really happy to bring the character back in to give a Caribbean feel to it and all of that," he said.<br/>The pivotal role of Ursula will be played by Queen Latifah.</p>
      <p>"The actual movie will be playing, but then there are these musical numbers that go live," she said. "You'll see the characters pop-out and come to life."</p>

      <p>The cast has been in Las Vegas to practice going back and forth between the film and the live performances.</p>
      <p>It all sounded pretty complicated to Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest when Queen Latifah visited "Live with Kelly and Ryan," but they all agreed the costumes are great.</p>
      <p>"Wait til you see it, I got this latex number and my tentacles? My tentacles. Don't get me started on my tentacles," Queen Latifah said.</p>
