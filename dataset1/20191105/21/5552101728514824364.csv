潤寅神鬼夫妻詐貸百億案越演越烈，主嫌楊文虎及王音之已逃亡美國，在美國加州落腳，向美國政府提出移民申請，打算長期滯美，仿佛完全遺忘被他們獨自拋下扛責的女兒楊宇晨。



楊宇晨涉嫌協助父母洗錢及脫產，在楊文虎夫妻逃亡後，早已被檢方發布境管，9月20日她企圖搭機出境，在機場被攔下，移送北檢複訊，檢察官認為她有串證、滅證及逃亡之虞，向法院聲押禁見獲准。

長相甜美的楊宇晨，常在臉書分享生活，還有許多和爸爸、媽媽的親密合照，看的出來一家人感情很好。7年前父親節時，楊宇晨還貼出親吻父親楊文虎的照片，並用英文感性寫下：「致我親愛的爸爸，謝謝你一直激勵著我努力工作、盡我所能，我很高興出生在這個家庭，父親節快樂！」

如今楊宇晨口中的好爸媽在美國樂逍遙，卻放她一人在台扛罪，淪落被收押在監牢的窘境，顯得格外諷刺。

The case of the smashing of ghosts and ghosts between husband and wife has become more and more fierce. The main suspects, Yang Wenhu and Wang Yinzhi, have fled to the United States, settled in California, and filed immigration applications with the US government. They intend to stagnate for a long time, as if they were completely forgotten by them. Yang Yuchen, the daughter of the blame.



Yang Yuchen was suspected of assisting parents in money laundering and off-production. After Yang Wenhu’s husband and wife fled, the prosecution had already released the situation. On September 20, she attempted to take the opportunity to leave the country. She was stopped at the airport and transferred to the Northern Inspection. The prosecutor thought she had a string. After the card, the testimony and the escape, the court is escorted to the ban.

Yang Yuchen, who looks sweet, often shares his life on Facebook, and there are many intimate photos with his father and mother. Seven years ago, on Father's Day, Yang Yuchen posted a photo of kissing his father Yang Wenhu and wrote it in English: ""To my dear father, thank you for inspiring me to work hard and do my best. I am very happy to be born here. Family, Happy Father's Day!""


Yang Yuchen (left) had previously posted a photo of kissing his father (right) on Facebook. He was emotionally thankful that he was ""happy to be born in this family"" and is now particularly ironic. (turning over Facebook)

Nowadays, the good parents in Yang Yuchen's mouth are happy in the United States, but she is guilty of being detained in Taiwan. It is particularly ironic to be detained in prison.
