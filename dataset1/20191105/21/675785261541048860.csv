Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was the star of the show again as Liverpool secured a hard-fought victory over Genk in the Champions League on Tuesday night.
The Reds took a 15th-minute lead through Georginio Wijnaldum, the Holland midfielder's first at Anfield since he scored twice against Barcelona in the 4-0 semi-final second-leg comeback in May.
But Anfield was stunned into silence when Genk equalised when Ally Mbwana Samatta got between Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner to head in a near-post corner five minutes before the break.
However the Reds regained their lead when Divock Origi's cross was held up and then laid off by Mo Salah for Oxlade-Chamberlain to fire home his third goal against this opposition.

Here are how Liverpool's players rated...

Liverpool (4-3-3)

Alisson Becker 6

Could do nothing about first half goal, and very little else to do.

Trent Alexander-Arnold 7

Brilliant intervention in first half, solid game without real exertion.

Joe Gomez 6

Not the most testing of evenings, and appreciated the run out .

Virgil van Dijk 7

Had dipped slightly of late, but looked composed again here.

James Milner 7

Was adventurous going forward, and experience was important.

Georginio Wijnaldum 7

Brilliant instinctive finish to open the scoring, adding goals now.

Fabinho 6

Quiet in the middle but appreciated the run through for Sunday.

Naby Keita 7

Looked lively around the box, almost scored and getting better.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7

MOTM. Beginning to find old form and nose for goal highly impressive.

Mo Salah 7

Has been troubled by ankle problem, but enjoyed central role .

Divock Origi 7

Looked a handful for former club, and put in a shift of work. 

Substitutes

Robertson for Keita, 74 mins; Mane for Oxlade-Chamberlain, 75 mins; Firmino for Origi, 89 mins
