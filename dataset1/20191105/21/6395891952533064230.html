      <p>National Transportation Safety Board investigator Lynn Spencer said Tuesday that investigators will spend about two days at the Rural Cemetery in New Bedford.</p>

      <p>Westport resident Paul Vidal crashed his Cessna 150 Monday afternoon about 40 minutes after taking off from New Bedford Regional Airport.</p>

      <p>Spencer says witnesses report Vidal was in good spirits as he spent about 15 minutes doing pre-flight checks.</p>
      <p>She also cautioned against drawing conclusions from video and witness statements suggesting Vidal was doing aerobatic maneuvers.</p>
