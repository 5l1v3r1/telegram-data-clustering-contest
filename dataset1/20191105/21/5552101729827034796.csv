【富二代露鳥57秒1】他開周興哲的保時捷去喝酒被開單　直擊兄弟街頭口角

本刊先前分別爆出周興哲跟他哥哥周予天各自情變，2人雖否認，但本刊日前在台北市微風南山看到失控的兄弟倆，在街上大爆口角。





02：30，周興哲（左1）跟周予天一群人在路邊吵鬧，音量毫無控制。

凌晨2點多左右，周予天跟他麻吉陳奕吵吵鬧鬧，一路走到周興哲白色的紅頂保時捷旁邊，後面則停了一輛白色凱燕；隨後周興哲雖然駕著另一輛新款保時捷帥氣現身，但表情有點臭臭。
果然，周予天開弟弟的車出來玩，卻又喝得爛醉，保時捷則因紅線違停被開罰單，兄弟因此起了勃谿。無奈的周興哲似乎已經懶得跟醉漢哥哥溝通，直接走到馬路中間，打電話叫代駕司機。


02：37，周興哲（左）找來代駕，解決哥哥周予天差點酒駕的危機。

一群人在信義區邊等邊嘰嘰喳喳，4男2女真的頗吵。周興哲原本要先把紅頂保時捷移到旁邊，但親友們真的太「魯洨」（台語：煩人），他只好先指揮大家要坐哪輛車，隨後才負責移車。
等到代駕抵達現場，大家立馬上車就位，周興哲駕駛新款保時捷擔任領頭羊的角色，引導大家一路駛往敦化南路，搞得台北街頭到處都是保時捷的高貴引擎聲。

In the previous issue, Zhou Xingzhe and his brother Zhou Yutian had their own emotional changes. Although the two people denied it, the magazine recently saw the out-of-control brothers in the breeze of Nanshan in Taipei, and they were on the street.





02:30, Zhou Xingzhe (left 1) and Zhou Yutian a group of people on the roadside noisy, the volume has no control.

At about 2 o'clock in the morning, Zhou Yutian was noisy with him, and he went to Zhou Xingzhe's white red-top Porsche, and stopped a white Kaiyan. Later, Zhou Xingzhe showed up with another new Porsche. But the expression is a bit stinky.
Sure enough, Zhou Yutian opened his brother's car to play, but he was drunk, Porsche was issued a ticket for the red line violation, and the brothers started Boxi. Helpless Zhou Xingzhe seems to be too lazy to communicate with the drunken brother, go directly to the middle of the road, call the driver.


02:37, Zhou Xingzhe (left) came to find a driver to solve the crisis of his brother Zhou Yutian almost drunk driving.

A group of people are waiting in the Xinyi District, and 4 men and 2 women are really noisy. Zhou Xingzhe had to move the red top Porsche to the side first, but the relatives and friends were really too ""reckless"" (Taiwanese: annoying), he had to direct everyone to take the car, and then responsible for the transfer.
When the driver arrived at the scene, everyone set up the car and Zhou Xingzhe took the role of the new Porsche as the leader, guiding everyone to the road to Dunhua South Road, making the streets of Taipei full of Porsche's noble engine sound.
