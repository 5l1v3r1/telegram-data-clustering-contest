Lana Del Rey Just Covered A Death Cab For Cutie Classic And Well Fuck, We’re Crying
05 Nov 2019, 21:55 by Joseph Earp
Death Cab for Cutie are having something of a cultural moment. It’s not hard to see why.
After all, the generation that Death Cab fostered into adulthood with their heartfelt songs about rejection and tragedy are becoming just old enough to start feeling nostalgic. Moreover, the fruits of the emo revolution are still sprouting — look around at the success of artists like Halsey and Yungblud and tell me that eyeliner and sterling, emotional songwriting isn’t still in fashion.

Well, now Lana Del Rey has gotten into the emo throwback movement, covering ‘I Will Follow You Into The Dark’ — and with the help of Ben Gibbard himself.
The cover went down at Del Rey’s Denver concert, where Death Cab For Cutie are on support duties (along with Australia’s own Julia Jacklin). Needless to say, it’s beautiful and graceful, because we are living in the Golden Age of Lana Del Rey content.
Seriously, everything the performer has done for the last little while has been astonishing, and we should lap up every last minute of it.
Watch the cover in full below.
