      <p>Former chancellor Philip Hammond has announced he will be standing down as an MP.</p>
      <p>Mr Hammond had the whip removed by Boris Johnson after voting to block a no-deal Brexit and he was not one of the 10 Tories to be reinstated before last week's General Election announcement.</p>
      <p>It means he would not have been able to have stand as a Conservative candidate at the upcoming December 12 election or else face total expulsion from the party he has "supported all my adult life".</p>
      <p>With Parliament being dissolved for the election campaign just after midnight, Mr Hammond has called time on his two decades in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>He is one of 64 MPs to announce they will be quitting Westminster, with a host of senior former Tory figures, such as ex-chancellor Ken Clarke and former home secretary Amber Rudd, choosing to call it a day.</p>

      <p>The Oxford graduate previously served as foreign, defence and transport secretary under David Cameron before being given the keys to Number 11 Downing Street by Theresa May.</p>
      <p>He resigned the role after Conservative MPs chose Mr Johnson to replace Mrs May as Prime Minister and has been a critic of the new administration's tactics since becoming an Independent.</p>
      <p>Mr Hammond, who has been MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in Surrey since 1997, said he felt "aggrieved" at the loss of the whip.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The Conservative Party that I have served has always had room for a wide range of opinions and has been tolerant of measured dissent," the Remain campaigner said in his resignation letter to constituents.</p>
      <p>"Many parliamentary colleagues have defied the party whip on occasions without any action being taken against them.</p>
      <p>"But however aggrieved I feel at the loss of the whip, and however strongly I believe that we must deliver Brexit through a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU to protect British jobs and prosperity, I remain a Conservative and I cannot, therefore, embark upon a course of action that would represent a direct challenge in a General Election to the party I have supported all my adult life."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 63-year-old said he would remain an "active party member" and thanked his constituents for allowing him 22 years of service.</p>
      <p>"It has been a pleasure to serve you and I wish you all every good fortunes for the future. I shall miss you greatly," he said.</p>
      <p>The Essex-born politician said he would work to "promote a widening of Conservative Party membership" to ensure its "future is a broad-based, forward-looking pro-business and pro-markets centre-right party".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was less than complimentary about the outgoing MP, accusing Mr Hammond of being "dishonest" since the referendum result.</p>
      <p>Asked if he wanted to pay tribute to the former cabinet minister, Mr Farage said: "Not really. He's a fraud.</p>
      <p>"He was elected in 2017 on a manifesto to respect the result of the referendum and over the past few years he has undermined it in every single way he could.</p>
      <p>"It's that kind of dishonest politics that we want to see the back of."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Anne Milton, another one of the 21 Tory MPs who had the whip withdrawn, will stand as an independent in the General Election.</p>
      <p>She posted on Twitter: "I wrote to the PM yesterday to tell him I felt unable to be a Conservative Candidate.</p>
      <p>"I have considered very carefully what is best to do and will stand as an Independent Candidate at the next General Election."</p>
      <p>Commenting on her decision, she said: "I want people in Guildford to have a choice at the General Election.</p>
      <p>"I have a background outside politics, a wealth of experience and a strong track record of achievement."</p>
      <p>She said she wants to represent her constituency without "being bound by party politics", adding: "People have become increasingly frustrated by political parties and their inability to work together for the common good and I believe Guildford needs a credible alternative."</p>
