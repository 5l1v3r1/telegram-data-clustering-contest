      <h1>Liverpool player ratings from Genk win as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain nets winner</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool edged to a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Genk in their Champions League clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:53:31+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was the star of the show again as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> secured a hard-fought victory over Genk in the Champions League on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Reds took a 15th-minute lead through Georginio Wijnaldum, the Holland midfielder's first at Anfield since he scored twice against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the 4-0 semi-final second-leg comeback in May.</p>
      <p>But Anfield was stunned into silence when Genk equalised when Ally Mbwana Samatta got between Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner to head in a near-post corner five minutes before the break.</p>
      <p>However the Reds regained their lead when Divock Origi's cross was held up and then laid off by Mo Salah for Oxlade-Chamberlain to fire home his third goal against this opposition.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here are how Liverpool's players rated...</i>

      <h3>Liverpool (4-3-3)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Alisson Becker 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Could do nothing about first half goal, and very little else to do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trent Alexander-Arnold 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brilliant intervention in first half, solid game without real exertion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joe Gomez 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not the most testing of evenings, and appreciated the run out .</p>

        <b>Virgil van Dijk 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had dipped slightly of late, but looked composed again here.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James Milner 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was adventurous going forward, and experience was important.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Georginio Wijnaldum 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brilliant instinctive finish to open the scoring, adding goals now.</p>

      <p>Quiet in the middle but appreciated the run through for Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Naby Keita 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looked lively around the box, almost scored and getting better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>MOTM. Beginning to find old form and nose for goal highly impressive.</p>

      <p>Has been troubled by ankle problem, but enjoyed central role .</p>
      <p>
        <b>Divock Origi 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looked a handful for former club, and put in a shift of work. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robertson for Keita, 74 mins; Mane for Oxlade-Chamberlain, 75 mins; Firmino for Origi, 89 mins</p>
