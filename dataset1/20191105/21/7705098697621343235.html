      <h1>Dune: The Sisterhood Loses Showrunner Jon Spaihts</h1>

      <p>Denis Villeneuve’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/dune"><b>Dune</b></a> remake is one of 2020’s most anticipated films. And if all goes well, it will herald the start of Warner Bros.’ next big franchise. The studio previously revealed that it will also bring Frank Herbert’s creations to the small screen with the upcoming HBO Max series <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/dune-the-sisterhood"><b>Dune: The Sisterhood</b></a>. But now, that project is in need of a new leader. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/dune-sisterhood-showrunner-exit-hbo-max-series-1252449?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">The Hollywood Reporter</a> brings word that Jon Spaihts has exited his role as showrunner.</p>
      <p>Spaihts co-wrote the screenplay for <b>Dune</b> alongside Villeneuve and Eric Roth. He was announced as the showrunner for <b>Dune: The Sisterhood</b> back in June. According to THR, Spaihts completed one draft of a script as well as a “revised outline” for the series. Unfortunately, Legendary TV was apparently unhappy with what he turned in and decided to replace him. Instead, Spaihts will focus his efforts on crafting the sequel to <b>Dune</b>, which still hasn’t been confirmed by the studio. Villeneuve still intends to direct <b>Dune: The Sisterhood</b>’s pilot episode and Spaihts will stay on as an executive producer.</p>

      <p><b>Dune: The Sisterhood</b> follows the Bene Gesserit, a group whose members have superhuman mastery over their minds and bodies. Some of them will appear in <b>Dune</b> next year, including Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) and Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling). However, it’s not clear if the new series will feature these particular characters or follow new ones entirely.</p>
      <p><b>Dune</b> will hit theaters on November 20, 2020. <b>Dune: The Sisterhood</b> is still without a release date.</p>
