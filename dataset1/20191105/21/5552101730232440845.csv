潤寅公司詐貸14家銀行破百億元風暴持續擴大！檢調陸續發動4波搜索，收押19人，還查出8家知名公司高層涉嫌配合作假帳詐貸，但潤寅負責人楊文虎、王音之夫妻卻早已潛逃美國加州，還神通廣大，竟還隔海遙控台灣親友協助洗錢、脫產及滅證。



檢調查出，他們涉嫌指示女兒楊宇晨、王音之胞弟王振賢2人，協助出脫在台還來不及變賣的不動產，並指示律師教導潤寅公司親信串供、滅證，甚至透過管道和負責行賄8家公司高層的白手套水果行互通如何脫罪，所幸遭檢調一一破解。

不僅如此，楊文虎還曾花費約1億2千萬元，向新民小學董事長鍾智文買來一席校董席次，在他逃往美國後，竟要女兒找舅舅王振賢幫忙，希望盡快贖回校董席次變現、匯到海外，登記在女兒名下的房產也要一併出售。

檢調早先一步掌握楊宇晨涉嫌協助父母洗錢，立即她發布境管，因此楊宇晨9月20日企圖搭機離境時，隨即在機場遭到逮補，北檢複訊後，認為她有串證、滅證及逃亡之虞，向法院聲押禁見獲准。
王振賢原本獲20萬元交保候傳，但是台北地檢署認為王男犯嫌重大，且全案還有諸多疑點尚未釐清，若讓王男交保恐有串供滅證之虞，因此提出抗告，台北地院11月2日以涉犯《洗錢防制法》改將王振賢裁准羈押禁見。
