      <p>Coleen Nolan has spoken out over her life as a child - where she would heartbreakingly 'dread' her drunk father returning home.</p>
      <p>Coleen, a Loose Women star, told the panel about the painful chapter in her life.</p>
      <p>The youngest of the Nolan sisters chatted during a segment called Life Before Loose on the ITV chat show today (Tuesday, November 5).</p>
      <p>She spoke out, breaking her silence as she bravely admitted to being terrified of her dad Tommy.</p>
      <p>Coleen lived in fear of her father coming home on a Saturday evening and 'starting an argument' with her late mum Maureen.</p>
      <p>In 2008 her sister Anne went public about being sexually abused by her dad in her autobiography Anne's Song.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Loose Women Coleen said: "He never drank during the day. He wasn't a from when he got up type of drinker.</p>
      <p>"When he went out, and certainly to the clubs because he was really, really popular and everybody loved my dad, he used to drink brandy.</p>
      <p>"I loved him until he’d had too much to drink and then I found him scary. Because he was quite argumentative when he was drunk.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"On a Saturday I used to have that dread of seven or eight o'clock thinking 'oh he'll be home soon' because I'd know he'd come in looking for an argument with my mum."</p>
      <p>Coleen, 54, says to this day she has 'drink phobia'.</p>
