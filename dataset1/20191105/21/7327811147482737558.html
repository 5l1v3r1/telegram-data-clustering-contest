      <p>NEW YORK -- Alec Baldwin is now suing the man who accused the actor of punching him in a fight over a Manhattan parking spot.</p>
      <p>In the defamation suit, Baldwin says the man, Wojciech Cieszkowski, lied when he told officers he was punched during the <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/alec-baldwin-appears-in-court-in-parking-spot-assault-case/4764886/">argument last November</a>.</p>
      <p>The Emmy-winning actor admitted to pushing the Rockland County contractor in the chest twice during the scuffle, but he says he never punched him.</p>
      <p>The man's attorney says Baldwin is trying to intimidate and silence his client.</p>
