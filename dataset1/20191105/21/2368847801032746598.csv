鐵證:「港警」當街飆普通話訓便衣「你不配做軍人」(視頻)

05 Nov 2019, 21:05

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】中共軍警假扮香港警察或混入人群，殘酷鎮壓港人抗爭，已成公開的秘密。中共軍警也越來越不加掩飾。日前網傳視頻顯示，一名「港警」在街頭用普通話訓斥一名便衣，該名便衣還向他敬軍禮做解釋。
11月4日，海外社交媒體熱傳一段視頻顯示，一隊香港防暴警察打扮的人員在街頭圍住一名灰衣男子。其中一名「警察」不顧身旁有多名記者在場，憤怒的用普通話大聲訓斥灰衣男：「你侮辱軍人！你不配做軍人！你現在是軍人，你知道嗎？」灰衣男隨後向他敬了一個軍禮，並疑似竭力辯解。經過一番口角後，在其他「警察」勸解下，灰衣男最後離開了現場。
大紀元記者隨後跟上並詢問灰衣男，灰衣男用普通話回答了記者提問。根據問答內容，似乎是因為灰衣男阻止「防暴警察」施放催淚彈，才引起雙方爭執。
海外社交媒體上，網友紛紛轉發視頻，並稱這將來可以作為中共軍人假扮港警和穿便衣作惡的鐵證。還有網友給視頻配上英文字幕，希望傳到西方社交媒體，向國際社會展示。



現在的香港街頭，除了「警察」對港人實施暴力外，還有大量便衣人員配合「警察」，包括提供情報和參與抓捕，也負責冒充示威者製造各種事端，給「警察」鎮壓提供藉口。
10月9日，網上也曾傳出一段視頻，顯示疑似一個「速龍小隊」在撤退時，其中兩人用普通話大聲招呼落後的同事「趕緊走」。有網友指出，兩人喊話疑似中國北方口音。



有香港警察爆料指，每次有大型示威活動，自己和一些同事就「被放假」，懷疑身份被中共軍隊盜用。還有同事聽到一些「速龍小隊成員」在衞生間用普通話交流。路透社近日也引述外交界消息指，自香港反送中以來，中共駐港部門人數至少增加了一倍，9月底的所謂「換防」就是變相增兵，進駐香港的還包括大量中共武警。
還有疑似知情者爆料，中共在香港有兩路人馬鎮壓港人，一路是軍警喬裝上街公開實施暴力，還有一路是中共特務負責審訊和暗殺重點人物，落入特務手中的示威者大多會被滅口。

Ironclad: ""Hong Kong Police"" is a plain-speaking plainclothes ""You are not worthy of being a soldier"" (video)

05 Nov 2019, 21:05

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] The Chinese Communists and the military have pretended to be Hong Kong policemen or mixed into the crowd. The brutal suppression of the Hong Kong people’s struggle has become an open secret. The CCP military police are becoming more and more undisguised. A recent video from the Internet shows that a ""Hong Kong Police"" reprimanded a plainclothes in the streets with Mandarin. The plainclothes also explained his military service.
On November 4th, a video from overseas social media showed that a team of Hong Kong riot police officers were wearing a gray man on the street. One of the ""policemen"" ignored the presence of a number of reporters nearby, and angryly shouted the gray man in Mandarin: ""You insult the soldiers! You are not a soldier! You are a soldier now, do you know?"" He then gave him a military ceremony and was suspected of trying to defend. After some rumors, under the other ""police"" persuasion, the gray man finally left the scene.
The Epoch Times reporter then followed up and asked the gray-clothed man, who answered the reporter's question in Mandarin. According to the question and answer, it seems that the gray-clothed man prevented the ""anti-riot police"" from applying tear gas, which caused disputes between the two sides.
On overseas social media, netizens have forwarded videos and said that this will serve as a proof of the CCP’s military pretending to be a Hong Kong policeman and wearing plain clothes. Some netizens added English subtitles to the video, hoping to spread to Western social media and show it to the international community.



In the streets of Hong Kong today, in addition to the ""police"" violence against Hong Kong people, there are a large number of plainclothes officers who cooperate with the ""police"", including providing information and participating in arrests. They are also responsible for posing as demonstrators to create various incidents and provide an excuse for ""police"" suppression. .
On October 9th, a video was also posted on the Internet, showing that an ""Athlon Dragon Squad"" was suspected of retreating. Two of them used Mandarin to greet their laggard colleague ""hurry away."" Some netizens pointed out that the two men were suspicious of the northern Chinese accent.



Some Hong Kong police broke the news that every time there were large-scale demonstrations, they and some of their colleagues were ""on vacation"" and suspected of being misappropriated by the Chinese Communists. Some colleagues heard some ""Athlon Dragon Team members"" communicate in Mandarin in the bathroom. Reuters recently quoted the diplomatic community as saying that since the reversal of Hong Kong, the number of CCP troops stationed in Hong Kong has at least doubled. The so-called ""replacement defense"" at the end of September is a disguised increase in troops. The presence of Hong Kong also includes a large number of CCP armed police.
There are also suspected insiders who broke the news. The CCP has two people in Hong Kong to suppress Hong Kong people. All the way is that the military and police are posing in the streets to publicly carry out violence. There is also a CCP special agent responsible for interrogation and assassination of key figures. Most of the demonstrators who fall into the hands of the special agents are the demonstrators. Will be ruined.
