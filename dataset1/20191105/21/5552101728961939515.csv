【新光金無限之戰2】吳東興豪砸2.5億元大買新光金　警告他別輕舉妄動
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by 劉曉霞, 鄒保祥
據股市觀測站10月底資料，新光金董座吳東進掌控的吳火獅文教基金會、吳東進基金會、新誠投資等控股公司，光是9月就較8月增加持股850多張；新光三越董座吳東興旗下的新光三越和東興投資，更是一個月內就砸下約2.5億元，大買新光金達2.62萬張。



知情人士透露，吳東興此次祭出銀彈買股攻勢，其實要怪吳東進自己壞事。今年7月吳東進意圖搶奪新光三越，就因為看中新光三越是新光金的第二大股東，他打的算盤就是自己掌控的持股加計新光三越後，就能越過金管會規定的無限徵求委託書10％門檻，可以啟動委託書大戰。
吳東進失算欲奪新光三越不成，反而跟吳東興家族打壞關係，讓自己陷入更大危機。「因新光三越經營權遭威脅，吳東興家族決定大買新光金持股，增加和吳東進的談判籌碼，讓他不敢輕舉妄動，再生覬覦新光三越的念頭。」
大買新光金持股的吳東興，今年高齡80歲，他是新光集團創辦人吳火獅的大哥吳金龍長子，長期經營新光三越，吳火獅在世時，吳東興頗受提拔，他曾說：「我當董事長（吳火獅）特助，辦公室不到十坪…新光人壽招募第一批人員，我是監考官之一。」
過去吳東興鮮少介入吳家四兄弟紛爭，直到今年新光三越改選董監事，吳東進打算拿下新光三越，威脅吳東興家族後，也讓吳東興不得不大幅增加新光金持股，這讓新光金明年的經營權再添變數。
針對大股東吳東興、吳東進和新勝增加新光金持股，吳東興增加籌碼以免新光三越經營權再遭威脅的內容，至截稿前，新光金和新光三越對此均無回應。

[New Light Jin Unlimited Battle 2] Wu Dongxing Hao Hao 250 million yuan to buy new light gold warned him not to act rashly
05 Nov 2019, 21:58 by Liu Xiaoxia, Zou Baoxiang
According to the information of the stock market observatory at the end of October, the Wuhuo Lions Culture and Education Foundation, Wudongjin Foundation, Xincheng Investment and other holding companies controlled by Wu Dongguang, the director of Xinguangjin Dongju, increased their holdings by more than 850 in August. Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Xinguang Sanyue and Dongxing Investment, which are owned by Dong Dong Wu Dongxing, have lost about 250 million yuan in one month and bought 26,200 new Guangguangjin.



According to informed sources, Wu Dongxing offered a silver bullet to buy a stock offensive. In fact, he must blame Wu Dongjin for his bad things. In July of this year, Wu Dongjin intended to snatch Xinguang Sanyue, because the newest light Sanyo is the second largest shareholder of Shin Kongjin. His calculation is that he holds the shareholding plus Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and can pass the unlimited request for entrustment by the FSC. Book 10% threshold, you can start the power of attorney.
Wu Dongjin’s loss of the desire to win the new light is not the case, but instead of breaking the relationship with the Wu Dongxing family, he is in a bigger crisis. ""Since Shin Kong Mitsukoshi’s management rights were threatened, the Wu Dongxing family decided to buy Xinguangjin to hold shares and increase the bargaining chip with Wu Dongjin, so that he would not dare to act rashly and regenerate the idea of Shin Kong Mitsukoshi.""
Wu Dongxing, who bought a new share of Xinguang Gold, is 80 years old this year. He is the eldest son of Wu Jinlong, the founder of Xinguang Group, Wu Jinlong. He has been operating Shin Kong Mitsukoshi for a long time. When Wu Shishi was alive, Wu Dongxing was promoted. He once said: ""I am a director. Long (Wu Huoshi) special assistance, the office is less than ten pings... Shin Kong Life recruits the first batch of personnel, I am one of the invigilators.""
In the past, Wu Dongxing rarely intervened in the disputes between the four brothers of Wujia. Until this year, Shin Kong Mitsukoshi re-elected the directors and supervisors. Wu Dongjin planned to win Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and threatened the Wu Dongxing family. He also wanted Wu Dongxing to increase the shareholding of Xinguangjin, which made Xinguang Kim’s management rights for the next year will be added.
For the major shareholders Wu Dongxing, Wu Dongjin and Xinsheng to increase the shareholding of Xinguang Gold, Wu Dongxing increased the chip to avoid the threat of Shin Kong Mitsukoshi's management rights. Until the deadline, Shin Kong and Shin Kong Mitsukoshi did not respond.
