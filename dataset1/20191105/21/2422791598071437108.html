      <p>OTTAWA -- A judicial recount in the Montreal riding of Hochelaga has been cancelled midway through the process.</p>
      <p>The Bloc Quebecois asked for the recount following the initial count on election day on Oct. 21, saying there was a discrepancy between the number of ballots in the ballot boxes and the listed results.</p>
      <p>The Bloc's candidate, Simon Marchand, finished 319 votes behind Liberal Soraya Martinez Ferrada.</p>
      <p>In the midst of the recount, however, the Bloc conceded the loss and withdrew its request.</p>
      <p>There are two other judicial recounts underway in Quebec and British Columbia.</p>
      <p>The NDP requested a recount in Port Moody-Coquitlam and the Bloc requested one in the riding of Quebec.</p>
