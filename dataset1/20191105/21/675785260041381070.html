      <h1>Chelsea player ratings from Ajax draw as Blues battle back against nine-man visitors</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea came back from three goals down to secure a stunning 4-4 draw in their Champions League clash with Ajax</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:52:28+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea came from three goals down to snatch a 4-4 draw from a roller-coaster Champions League encounter with Ajax.</p>
      <p>The game got off to a blistering start when the visitors took a shock lead in the second minute, after Tammy Abraham turned an Ajax free-kick into his own net past the helpless Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>But two minutes later and the Blues were level when Christian Pulisic was fouled in the penalty area, with Jorginho duly stepping up to confidently fire home the equaliser.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's side, however, found themselves behind again when Quincy Promes sneaked in at the back post to head home a second for the buoyant visitors and then Hakim Ziyech and Donny Van De Beek gave them a surprise 4-1 lead. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> reduced the deficit to two again when Pulisic's cross was prodded towards goal by Abraham and Cesar Azpilicueta made sure at the far post.</p>
      <p>Then in another crazy 60 seconds Daley Blind was shown a second yellow card for fouling Abraham and Joel Veltman followed him down the tunnel for handling Callum Hudson-Odoi's shot.</p>
      <p>Stamford Bridge was rocking as Jorginho rolled in his second penalty of the night. And it was pandemonium moments later when substitute Reece James levelled the scores.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Kepa Arrizabalaga 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Had an absolute stinker with Ziyech’s free kick ending up with an own goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cesar Azpilicueta 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>MotM. Booked. Led incredible fightback, a real captain's performance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fikayo Tomori 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was a sharp learning curve - got isolated, beaten and taught a lesson.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kurt Zouma 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Great spirit and passion, fought hard to get Chelsea back in the game.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Marcos Alonso 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Undone horribly in defence, hooked at half time which tells its own story.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jorginho 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Struck home two ice cool penalties to get Chelsea level - didn’t last. Decent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mateo Kovacic 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>The busiest of Chelsea’s midfielders, he worked hard and never gave up.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Mason Mount 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quiet night as he struggled to make things happen. Hobbled off injured.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Willian 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frustrating first half but worked hard and battled in Chelsea's comeback.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Christian Pulisic 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Never gave up the fight, worked so hard in Chelsea's fightback. Excellent again.</p>
