      <h1>Craig Gordon sent transfer advice as Celtic keeper urged to make January exit</h1>
      <h2>Former Parkhead goalie Rab Douglas believes Gordon needs to be playing first team football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:50:25+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Former Celtic keeper Rab Douglas has urged <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-gordon">Craig Gordon</a> to leave the club in January in a bid to find first team football.</p>
      <p>The veteran goalie has dropped down the pecking order at the Parkhead club with the arrival of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Fraser Forster</a> on loan at Southampton.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-bain">Scott Bain</a> has also been handed a new four-year deal and looks to be a part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> 's long-term plans after displacing Gordon at the number one spot last season.</p>
      <p>And Arbroath goalkeeping coach Douglas believes Gordon, 36, needs to be playing regularly at this stage in his career.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t3fs4">BBC Sportsound</a> : "I think it will get to January and Craig (Gordon) will have a discussion with Lennon.</p>
      <p>"I don't think anybody wants to sit in the bench, it's not about the money. Craig will have enough money.</p>
      <p>"The big thing is going out playing and enjoying it. He's coming to the tail end of his career now, he needs to go to a level where he is really enjoying his football.</p>
      <p>"I think the wages as well, Celtic might want to free up ages and bring a younger goalie in. They've certainly got the two boys out at Championship clubs on loan so it will be interesting how Lennon deals with that."</p>
