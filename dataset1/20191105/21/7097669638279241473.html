      <h1>Trump leads Warren 49 percent to 27 percent among swing voters, poll shows</h1>

      <p>Swing voters are real, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/upshot/swing-voters-2020-election.html"><i>The New York Times</i> reports</a>, and they don't seem to be too keen on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) right now.</p>
      <p>In a new poll conducted alongside Siena college, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/upshot/swing-voters-2020-election.html">the <i>Times</i> found</a> that these swing, or "persuadable," voters — whose most common attribute is that they're ideologically inconsistent — represent about 15 percent of the electorate. The voters, a majority of whom are men, have a favorable view of former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but that's not the case for Warren, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/upshot/swing-voters-2020-election.html">the <i>Times</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/upshot/swing-voters-2020-election.html">trounced</a> Warren among the swing voters in the poll, by a count of 49 percent to 27 percent. In contrast, the president only leads Biden 43 percent to 37 percent. One possible explanation is that Warren is veering too far left for these voters, 80 percent of whom consider themselves either conservative or moderate, meaning it's unlikely they'll head for a ship that's being blown by more progressive winds. Indeed, 82 percent of those surveyed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/upshot/swing-voters-2020-election.html">want</a> a candidate whose focused on common ground as opposed to one fighting for a more progressive agenda, which has been <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876115/democratic-frontrunners-hurled-veiled-critiques-each-other-during-iowa-fundraiser">a public source of disagreement</a> between Biden, who represents the former, and Warren, who represents the latter.</p>
