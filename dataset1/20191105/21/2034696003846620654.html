      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/pharrell-williams">Pharrell Williams</a> has reflected on the ‘Blurred Lines’ copyright case in a new interview, revealing that he disagrees with the verdict.</p>
      <p>Back in 2015, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robin-thicke-0-9-1216985">a federal jury ruled</a> that Robin Thicke and Williams’ hit single shared similarities to <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/Marvin-Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>‘s ‘Got To Give It Up’ (1977), and that the two artists must pay half of the song’s royalties Gaye’s family. They were also made to make a one-off payment of $5.3m (£4m) in damages.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <i>GQ</i> about the lengthy legal battle, Williams has now claimed that the 2013 song only shares a “feeling” with the classic track.</p>
      <p>“It hurt my feelings because I would never take anything from anyone. And that really set me back,” the star explained to Rick Rubin in the new video.</p>
      <p>After Rubin adds that ‘Blurred Lines’ sounds “nothing like” ‘Got To Give It Up’, Williams replied: “Nope. But the feeling was. You can’t copyright a feeling… All salsa songs sound pretty much the same.”</p>

      <p>Rubin went on to say that the case could have a negative impact on the music industry, as artists will become hesitant in their writing due to the fear of being sued.</p>
      <p>“It’s bad for music because we’ve had an understanding of what a song is, and now based on that one case, there’s a question of what a song is,” he reasoned. “It’s not what it used to be because in the past, it would be the chords, the melody and the words … And your chords, your melody and your words — none of them had anything to do [with Gaye’s song].</p>

      <p>“It leaves us as music-makers in a really uncomfortable place making things because we don’t know what you can do.”</p>

      <p>This comes after Pharrell <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/pharrell-williams-speaks-blurred-lines-realised-live-chauvinist-culture-2557092">recently spoke out against the “chauvinist culture” reflected in ‘Blurred Lines</a>‘. He explained that he “didn’t get” the backlash levelled at the track upon its release.</p>
      <p>“Then I realised that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn’t matter that that’s not my behaviour,” he added.</p>
