        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Orlando Pirates 0-0 Maritzburg United</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 05 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Orlando Stadium</p>
      <p>Orlando Pirates' stuttering form in the Absa Premiership continued following a goalless draw with Maritzburg United at Orlando Stadium, where both sides finished with 10 men.</p>
      <p>With Thembinkosi Lorch and Mthokozisi Dube missing through suspension, Gabadinho Mhango and Abel Mabaso were drafted into the line-up as Fortune Makaringe lined up against his former side for the first time since joining Pirates.</p>

      <p>Maritzburg were certainly the team on form heading into the encounter, but there was a re-call for on-loan Mamelodi Sudowns striker Jeremy Brockie alongside former Buccaneer Thabiso Kutumela.</p>
      <p>Despite the visitors' form, it was Pirates who started the brighter of the two sides and they could have been a couple goals up in the opening 15 minutes had it not been for Kabelo Dlamini's poor finishing.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg, meanwhile, had to wait until the half-hour mark for their first opening as a long throw from Dan Morgan found Rushine de Reuck, who steered a header over the crossbar from close range.</p>
      <p>Richard Ofori ensured the sides went into the halftime break level pegging as the the Team of Choice shot-stopper proved his worth by denying Vincent Pule from 10-yards out, while Happy Jele denied Kutumela with a superb block at the other end.</p>
      <p>With the Buccaneers struggling in the final third upon resumption of the second half, coach Rhulani Mokwena instilled a double change just before the hour mark as Augustine Mulenga and Justin Shonga replaced Tshegofatso Mabasa and Dlamini.</p>
      <p>It went a bit pear-shaped for the home side minutes later after being reduced to 10 men when Jele received his second yellow card for a late challenge on Kutumela. He will now miss the Soweto derby on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, the odds were evened up with 12 minutes remaining in the second half as Maritzburg's Kwanda Mngonyama was given his marching orders for a second bookable offence.</p>
      <p>Pirates thought they had bagged the winner in the final 10 minutes when Shonga rattled the upright, although the ball was not deemed to have crossed the line.</p>
      <p>In the end, Maritzburg were able to see out the closing stages of the second half to deny Pirates victory and claim a valuable point on the road.</p>
