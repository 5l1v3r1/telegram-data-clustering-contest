      <p>Two men from Adelaide, Australia, Casey Dean and his friend Eduard Nitz, say they bought a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911041077217056-mcdonalds-replaces-ceo-easterbrook-over-violating-corporate-ethics/">McDonald</a>'s Quarter Pounder with Cheese almost 25 years ago, ABC reported.</p>
      <p>The boys kept the burger for their friend, but he didn't show up, so they say they "still have the burger". What started as a joke turned into a very popular thing in 2015, when they discovered the burger - and it still looked the same. The two posted photos and videos of the burger online, resulting in it going viral. The burger even has its own website and a Tinder profile, although these were closed as it took too much time to answer all the responses, reports say.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's as hard as a rock", Casey Dean said, adding that it has never smelled at all.</blockquote>

      <p>Prior to this, another old burger from McDonald's, which is on display in Iceland, became very popular, as it celebrated its 10th birthday last week, according to reports.</p>
