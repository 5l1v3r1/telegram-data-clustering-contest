      <p>On Monday night's episode of "The Good Doctor," Shaun Murphy was forced to deliver a baby prematurely.</p>
      <p>The infant was no bigger than a hand and came two months before what is considered likely to survive outside of the womb.</p>
      <p>In real life, doctors say medical advances have lead to more babies surviving premature births.</p>
      <p>As of 2016, 35% of babies born at 23 weeks survived thanks to active care by doctors.</p>
      <p>Now, experts recommend doctors should allow for more births as early as 23 weeks in extreme cases.</p>
