今年56歲、單身的李光輝拿起手機，出示他與翁子涵的對話紀錄，回憶2人相識的過程。



他說，2013年某天，他在台北車站遇到剛滿18歲、正擔任車展showgirl的翁，外貌姣好的她立刻吸引李的目光，為此他二話不說，上前遞名片搭訕，告訴翁自己開設生醫公司，要找行政人員，希望她能到公司面試。
不久，翁子涵前來應徵，成為李光輝公司的櫃台人員。外表出眾的她，讓男同事趨之若鶩，連老闆李光輝也祕密追求，最後終於成功擄獲翁的心，因擔心辦公室戀情曝光，會有負面影響，2人愛得很低調，同事們毫無所悉。











李光輝指出，翁子涵不只有美麗的外表，工作表現同樣令人讚賞。他形容，翁在公司任職期間，曾與他一起到北京和其他企業簽約，靠著她的機警反應、談吐得宜，協助公司簽了超過10份合約。
