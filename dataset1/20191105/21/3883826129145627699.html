        <b>Exeter chief executive Tony Rowe says Premiership champions Saracens should be relegated for breaching salary cap rules.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Saracens face a 35-point deduction and £5.36m fine after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/47449123">an investigation</a> into business partnerships between chairman Nigel Wray and some of their players.</p>
      <p>Rowe's Exeter lost to Saracens in each of the past two Premiership finals.</p>
      <p>"We, for a number of years, have suspected they've been infringing the salary cap," he told BBC Radio Devon.</p>
      <p>"But I don't think the penalty is severe enough. You take away 35 points this year - they could still be in the semi-finals and could still end up at Twickenham [in the Premiership final]."</p>
      <p>Asked what would be a fair punishment, Rowe said: "Relegation - in professional sport in America, if you're in breach of the salary cap you get thrown out completely."</p>

      <p>European champions Saracens <a href="https://www.saracens.com/club-statement-salary-cap/">described the sanctions as "heavy-handed"</a> and will appeal against the penalty, with the punishments suspended until the outcome.</p>
      <p>Former Saracens skipper Kyran Bracken called the punishments "very unfair", saying the club had "nurtured" their own players rather than "buying success".</p>
      <p>"I was shocked, dismayed, disappointed as an ex-Saracen."</p>
      <p>The former England scrum-half, 44, told BBC Sport: "It seems very, very harsh when you compare it to say, out and out cheating that may, or has, been done.</p>
      <p>"With Harlequins and bloodgate - where players went on the pitch with capsules - they got a £260,000 fine and no points deduction, yet for Saracens it's 35 points and over £5m fine, it just feels disproportionate."</p>

      <h3>'I feel bitter about it'</h3>
      <p>Rob Baxter's Exeter side won their first Premiership title in 2016-17 - beating Saracens in the semi-finals - but have subsequently been beaten by the London club in each of the past two Twickenham finals, including a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48438232">37-34 defeat in June.</a></p>
      <p>Rowe called the £7m cap "a juggle", saying the club have had to make unpopular decisions on player departures to stay under the limit.</p>
      <p>"It's the management that have totally flouted the rules and regulations, which has enabled them to put a squad on the pitch that we couldn't match," he said.</p>
      <p>"I feel a bit bitter about it because we were only just beaten. I'm not blaming the [Saracens] players, you can't blame the players.</p>
      <p>"It leaves a bit of a nasty taste in my mouth - if you're in sport and you get beaten fair and square that's fine, but then to find out that your opponents have actually cheated, it's not good."</p>
      <p>Fellow Premiership side Worcester Warriors - who say they are "proud" to adhere to the salary cap - backed the league for taking action against Saracens.</p>
      <p>Sarries previously claimed they "readily comply" with salary cap rules and were able to spend above <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/37311767">the cap</a> because of the high proportion - almost 60% - of home-grown players in their squad.</p>
      <p>"The salary cap regulations are there for good reasons. They ensure the financial sustainability of clubs and control inflationary pressures as well as maintaining a competitive Premiership," <a href="https://warriors.co.uk/2019/11/05/club-statement-saracens-salary-cap-breach/">Warriors said a statement.</a></p>
      <p>"The salary cap regulations were unanimously agreed by all clubs so everyone is aware of their obligations to comply with them and of the potential consequences should they breach them."</p>
