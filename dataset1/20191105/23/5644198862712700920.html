      <p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore People’s Party (SPP) has elected Mr Steve Chia as secretary-general and Mr Jose Raymond as chairman, it announced in a Facebook post on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>

      <p>Mr Chia, 49, succeeds veteran politician Chiam See Tong, 84, who <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chiam-see-tong-steps-down-spp-central-executive-committee-12006830">stepped down as secretary-general last month</a> after 23 years at the post. Mr Chiam remains a member of the party.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Mr Chiam for his many years of mentorship and guidance in Parliament,” Mr Chia said of his predecessor.</p>
      <p>“He has been a beacon in my life, and this is truly an honour for me to be given this task of taking over his appointment in the Singapore People’s Party.”</p>
      <p>Mr Chia, previously SPP’s organising secretary, added that the transition for the new team has been “smooth and stable”.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to working together as a team and in helping to continue the legacy of the SPP.”</p>
      <p>Mr Chia was a member of the National Solidarity Party (NSP) from 1995 to 2018, and a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2006.</p>
      <p>In the 2015 General Elections, he intended to contest in the MacPherson Single-Member Constituency but later dropped out of the race.</p>

      <p>The 47-year-old is the chief strategy officer of communications firm Spin Worldwide and deputy chairman of the Chiam See Tong Sports Foundation, a charity that helps disadvantaged athletes.</p>
      <p>The former journalist once served as press secretary to Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.</p>
      <p>The appointment was an “emotional moment”, Mr Raymond said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought that this day would ever happen.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of work ahead of us, as a collective leadership. It is immaterial what positions we hold within the party, and we must always work together as a team.”</p>
      <p>He added that it is their “duty and responsibility to carry on the work of Mr and Mrs Chiam and the values of the SPP – of being loyal to the country, of bringing good policy ideas to the table, to help people in need, to be their voices, and to always be their ray of hope".</p>
      <p>Other office bearers include vice-chair Williiamson Lee, assistant secretary-general Ariffin Sha, treasurer Mario Ong and organising secretary Eman Lim.</p>
      <p>SPP currently holds no seats in Parliament after losing Potong Pasir SMC to the People's Action Party in 2011.</p>
