Tucson voters soundly reject 'sanctuary city' initiative
05 Nov 2019, 23:16 by Sam Radwany



Tucson will not become Arizona's first sanctuary city after voters rejected Prop 205 Tuesday night.
The ballot measure was soundly rejected by 71.4 percent of voters in Tucson, according to unofficial election results released by the city, with all precincts reporting. Some remaining ballots will be counted in the coming days.
The group Tucson Families Free and Together spearheaded the ballot initiative earlier this year, collecting thousands of signatures in the city. Despite several attempts to block the measure from appearing on Tuesday's ballot, their efforts were ultimately successful.
The measure was widely opposed by local leaders including the Pima County Sheriff, Tucson Police officials and Tucson's largely Democratic city council and mayor.
