      <h1>Jesse Watters blasts Mexican government after cartels murder 9 Americans</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/watters-world">Jesse Watters</a> accused the Mexican government of being "corrupt" one day after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-for-war-against-mexican-drug-cartel-monsters-after-americans-murdered-in-shootout">nine American nationals</a> were murdered by members of drug cartels only several dozen miles from the U.S. border.</p>
      <p>Mexico is a dangerous country and the cartels effectively have the government in their pocket, Watters claimed Tuesday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Five</a>."</p>
      <p>"They tell the Mexican government officials what to do," he said.</p>
      <p>"Many of them are on the take -- they can't control the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-for-war-against-mexican-drug-cartel-monsters-after-americans-murdered-in-shootout">cartels</a>. Most of the time they don't want to. They're just dancing with the devil, it's kind of an arranged marriage."</p>

      <p>Watters pointed to the ultimately successful hunt for Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman -- currently imprisoned in New York -- saying the kingpin was worth about $1 billion when authorities finally corraled him.</p>
      <p>"Our neighbors to the south are corrupt," he added.</p>
      <p>"I think its a dangerous country -- outside the resorts this could happen anywhere, it's not a safe place to be," he said of the murders, which occurred when a vehicle carrying women and children encountered armed cartel members in the northern part of Sonora state, near Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, Watters speculated, will not be apprehensive about going after the cartels.</p>

      <p>"It's good politics to go after the cartels. It's good policy to go after the cartels. And watch -- he'll do that and you'll see the media and the Democrats start defending drug cartels, I guarantee it."</p>
      <p>In the wake of the murders, the State Department issued a statement saying: “The safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad is among the Department of State’s top priorities. When a U.S. citizen is missing or passes away overseas, we engage with local officials at multiple levels and provide all appropriate consular assistance."</p>
