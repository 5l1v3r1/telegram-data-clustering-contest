      <p>Maritzburg United shot-stopper Richard Ofori says picking up a point against Orlando Pirates felt the same as getting a win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/orlando-pirates/absa-premiership-report-orlando-pirates-v-maritzburg-united-05-november-2019/666808">Two Red Cards, No Goals, Bucs Drop Points</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Ofori played a starring role as the Team of Choice denied the Buccaneers victory in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>"It's a vert good result because we knew the game is gonna be tough because after [Orlando Pirates] losing against Chiefs I know definitely they will come, they will come hard on us, we know. To pick a point here I think it's a win," the Ghanaian international goalkeeper said on SuperSport TV after receiving his Man of the Match accolade.</p>
      <p>"It's normal because once you're playing against Orlando Pirates here, definitely as a goalkeeper you need to stand out, that's what I did, so I will thank my players because they did very well, we defended the goal very well, so I'll say this [award] is for all of us."</p>
      <p>Ofori did not want to be drawn into arguments of whether Justin Shonga's strike that hit the underside of the crossbar, actually crossed the line or not.</p>
      <p>"I can't say much about it, but what I know is that the most important thing we picked a draw here, that's the most important thing and we know, we need to keep on pushing, make our fans and the Maritzburg city happy," he added.</p>
