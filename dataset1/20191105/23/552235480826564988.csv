The Championship side targeted Preston's Alex Neil at the weekend, but were also unsuccessful with their attempts.
Clarke took charge of Scotland in May but has suffered a frustrating spell on the Hampden touchline, with only two wins from six games.
 
Scotland failed to qualify from their Euro 2020 group, but have a chance to reach the tournament with a play-off tie in March.
Clarke named his 25-man squad for their two remaining group games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan as they look to build momentum for the crucial game next year.
