      <h1>Microsoft is not killing the OneNote UWP app… yet.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:31:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:31</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>The OneNote UWP app is always held up as evidence of Microsoft’s commitment to UWP, particularly because it displaced the win32 OneNote 2016 app, leading to much complaints from regular users forced to use the less mature app.</p>
      <p>The news that Microsoft has however decided to resume support of the Win32 OneNote 2016 app is therefore rather portentous for the last remaining UWP Office desktop app of note.</p>
      <p>At Ignite 2019 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-extending-the-mainstream-support-for-onenote-2016/">Microsoft said they would continue to support the old app</a> up to 2023, due to “user feedback” and even update it with new features, such as @mentions for collaboration.</p>
      <p>With the Office UWP apps mostly dumped, it seemed likely that the OneNote app will soon be sidelined also.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-will-continue-to-support-onenote-for-windows-10-but-the-future-is-uncertain">Neowin</a>, however, reports that according to Microsoft this is not the case,  and for now, both apps will remain supported.</p>
      <p>They however also suggested this situation will not continue “indefinitely”, and given the direction things have been moving over the last few years, I suspect it will not be the UWP app which will be the last one standing.</p>
