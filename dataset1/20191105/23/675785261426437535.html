      <h1>Strictly's Mike Bushell books Blackpool hotel room despite dance-off appearances</h1>
      <h2>The BBC presenter is thinking ahead - despite being in the dreaded dance off three times with Katya Jones</h2>

      <p>Strictly Come Dancing star Mike Bushell has confessed that he's already booked himself a hotel room in Blackpool before the show goes live there in two weeks time.</p>
      <p>Each year, the celebrities and their professional dance partners mark a performance at the seaside town in their minds as a key milestone in the competition.</p>
      <p>But sadly, not everyone makes it to the Tower Ballroom.</p>
      <p>And despite being in the dance-off three times in a row, hopeful BBC presenter Mike has already sorted himself digs for the night in the northern town.</p>

      <p>Mike admitted he forked out with his own cash so he can visit Blackpool even if he does get booted off before then.</p>
      <p>He told the Daily Star: "I’ve always wanted to go to Blackpool. I was going along to support the others. I’m going to Blackpool whatever.</p>
      <p>“I’ve booked the hotel and I’ve paid for it myself and I’m going to cheer everyone else on.</p>
      <p>"If I’m there as part of the competition that would be amazing and be a bonus but I’m going anyway to cheer them all on," vowed Mike.</p>

      <p>The sports presenter won his third dance-off in a row with partner Katya Jones last weekend as they danced the Charleston against Viscountess Emma Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec.</p>
      <p>Mike has had a turbulent time in the competition and been visciously trolled on social media.</p>
      <p>But he's been keeping in good spirits despite the drama and joked that his appearances in the dance-off were replacing “replacing Poldark and Line Of Duty as the Sunday night drama”.</p>

      <p>While his partner Katya vowed to quit social media over the backlash surrounding their survival in the dance compeition.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old told the <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">Sun on Sunday</a> : "I'm off social media; it's not real.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's real what we're doing with our dancing and performance.</p>
      <p>"There's no need for negatives. I just want to do my own thing."</p>

      <p>But just days later, she took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to share a snap of herself holding Mike up in the air as he balanced on her back.</p>
      <p>She said: "We’ve got each other’s back partner @mikebushellofficial ! Always making me a proud teacher! Look how far you’ve come! Thank you everyone who supports us! Week 8! Wow"</p>
