      <h1>CBS is Planning a Zorro Reboot With a Female Lead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:01:41+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/propagate-cbs-tv-studios-deal-showtime-zorro-re-imagining-nbc-home-cbs-1202775312/">Deadline</a> is reporting that CBS TV Studios is developing a new <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/zorro"><b>Zorro</b></a> TV series. However, this one will have a female lead, rather than the traditional male Zorro. The show is part of a first-look deal with Propagate, a production company run by Ben Silverman and Howard Owens. </p>
      <p>Rather than take place in the past, the new <b>Zorro</b> will have more of a “modern day” setting, according to the report. It will follow Z, a female descendant from the Zorro bloodline, as she fulfills her duty to “protect the defenseless in her community.” Alfredo Barrios Jr. (<b>Burn Notice, Magnum P.I.</b>) is on board as both writer and executive producer. </p>
      <p><b>Zorro</b> was introduced way back in 1919, in an issue of <b>All-Story Weekly</b>. He’s a predecessor for the modern superhero, as well as  the subject of several American film serials, movies, comics, novels, and TV shows.</p>

      <p>However, it’s been awhile since Zorro appeared on either the big or small screen. The last film was 2005’s <b>The Legend of Zorro</b> (pictured above), with Antonio Banderas playing the lead character. At one point, a new <b>Zorro</b> movie, <b>Z</b>, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/364703-jonas-cuaron-to-write-and-direct-new-zorro-movie-z">was in the works</a>; but there’s been no word on its progress in a long time.</p>
      <p>The deal between CBS and Propagate also includes a pair of other projects. One is a new drama called <b>Home </b>from writer Jorge Reyes. And the other is a yet untitled project by <b>Fear the Walking Dead</b> scribe Melissa Scrivner-Love.</p>
      <p>There’s no word yet on an air date for the new <b>Zorro</b> series, or if it’ll go to CBS or CB All Access But, hopefully, it’ll have swordplay and derring-do like the classic <b>Zorro</b> serials of old.</p>
      <p>What do you think about <b>Zorro</b> making a comeback with a female lead? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
