      <p>A dad collapsed and died trying to eat 50 eggs as part of a £20 bet.</p>
      <p>Subhash Yadav was about to take a bite out of the 42nd one when he dropped to the ground.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old never regained consciousness and died a few hours later.</p>
      <p>Police said that Subhash and his friend had gone to a market area in Jaunpur, India, when an argument broke out between the pair.</p>
      <p>They then challenged each other to eat 50 eggs for 2,000 rupees (£21).</p>
      <p>Subhash accepted the bet and managed to scoff 41 before he collapsed and fell unconscious, reports <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/india/india-50-egg-eating-challenge-claims-mans-life-1.1572862416199">Gulf News.</a></p>
