      <p>(Reuters) - Tinder-owner Match Group Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MTCH.O">MTCH.O</a>) forecast fourth-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Tuesday as it faces stiff competition from rival online dating services, sending its shares down about 15% in extended trading.</p>

      <p>Shares of parent IAC/InterActiveCorp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/IAC.O">IAC.O</a>) also down about 11% after the bell.</p>
      <p>Match has been facing increasing competition from a host of rivals including Bumble and Facebook Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a>) dating platform that recently launched in the U.S. in September.</p>
      <p>Bumble also stepped up by launching its app in India late last year, a market with a huge potential for dating-related services.</p>
      <p>Tinder — which has made “swipe left” and “swipe right” a point of pop culture conversations - added 437,000 average subscribers in the quarter, down from an addition of 503,000 in the previous quarter. The addition brought Tinder subscribers up to 5.7 million in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>To fend off competition, Match has boosted its marketing spend on its money-spinner Tinder in emerging markets, including India and Latin America, as well on its other dating services, PlentyOfFish and Hinge.</p>
      <p>Match’s total operating expenses rose about 20% to $364.9 million in the quarter.</p>
      <p>The owner of OkCupid and PlentyOfFish expects current-quarter total revenue between $545 million and $555 million, below analysts’ estimate of $559.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The forecast overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a 19% growth in average subscribers that rose to 9.6 million from a year ago, including a rise of about 29% subscribers in its international markets.</p>
      <p>Last month, parent IAC said it intends to spin off its ownership stake in Match Group resulting in the full separation of the two companies.</p>
      <p>Match on Tuesday said it expects spin-off related expense to be about $10 million in fiscal 2020.</p>
      <p>The revenue forecast comes at a time when Match is in the middle of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint related to the company’s certain marketing-related claims.</p>
      <p>Total revenue rose 22% to $541.5 million in the third quarter, edging past analysts’ estimates of about $540.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The company’s net earnings attributable to Match Group shareholders rose to $151.5 million, or 51 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, from $130.2 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
