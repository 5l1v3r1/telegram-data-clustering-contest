（中央社台北5日電）棒球在睽違12年之後重回奧運賽場，明年東京奧運將有6支球隊參賽，除了地主國日本直接取得參賽權之外，目前還有以色列以歐非區資格賽冠軍拿到一席，另外4席資格將從12強等賽事產生。
東京奧運棒球只開放6個名額，其中地主日本自動取得一席，根據世界棒壘球總會的規劃，另外5席名額將分別自歐非區資格賽、世界12強棒球賽、美洲區資格賽與最終6搶1資格賽4項比賽中產生。
歐洲與非洲區資格賽稍早已落幕，以色列拿下冠軍，成為第2支取得東京奧運棒球賽參賽權的球隊。
正在舉行的世界12強賽則有兩席名額，分別是亞洲與大洋洲區除日本之外名次最佳者、美洲區名次最佳者，但前提是這兩席名額都得打進複賽。
以12強目前的情況來看，A組的墨西哥與美國已打進複賽，B組與C組今明兩天開打，亞洲與大洋洲區這次共有日本、中華、南韓與澳洲參賽，中華隊想取得參賽權，除了必須打進複賽之外，名次還得排在南韓與澳洲之前。
如果參加12強賽的中華隊、南韓與澳洲都未打進複賽，則將在12強預賽後馬上加辦3搶1資格賽，取代12強的亞洲區參賽名額。
美洲球隊除了在12強能拿到一席參賽名額外，明年3月的美洲區資格賽將再產生一個名額。
最後一席名額則將在明年3月於台中舉辦的6搶1最終資格賽中產生，參賽的6支球隊包括歐非區第2名的荷蘭，美洲區資格賽第2名與第3名的球隊，另外3支參賽球隊得視12強結果而定，亞洲區為中國以及中華或南韓其中未在12強賽取得參賽權的球隊，大洋洲區資格賽冠軍（若澳洲在12強取得奧運資格與大洋洲資格賽冠軍，則由大洋洲資格賽亞軍遞補）。（編輯：唐聲揚）1081105
