At Logan Airport Terminal E, families of fallen police officers united, not by grief this time, but by the possibility of healing. They are taking part in a free Heroes Cruise of Germany courtesy of Vantage Deluxe World Travel.
""We are a police family my goal is to never let Jerry's memory go,"" said Cynthia Hurley.

Hurley's husband was Boston Police officer Jeremiah Hurley, who was killed in the line of duty in 1991.
Cynthia is going on the trip to help others.
""I don't think you can ever put it aside, we are here and hopefully we are going to have a good time,"" said Hurley.
Falmouth Police officer Ryan Moore was shot on the job in July 2018. 
""I was shot. But fortunately, I made it out unlike a lot of other officers,"" said Moore. 
He's retired now but his road to recovery is long.
""After the incident, you think everybody is evil and you forget there are still good people out there,"" said Moore. 



This group will spend a week together cruising Germany's Rhine River but it is the process of recovery that really binds them.
""It's a family and it is something special that we have something in common. And that our loved ones paid the sacrifice. They are all heroes,"" said Doris Beauregard Shecrallah.
In a little over a week, these families will return to Boston. It's hoped this experience will strengthen bonds and help these heroes heal.
