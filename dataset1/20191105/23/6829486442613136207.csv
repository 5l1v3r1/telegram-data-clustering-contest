All The Best Reactions To The My Chemical Romance Australian Tour
05 Nov 2019, 23:04 by Joseph Earp
By now, the unbelievable news has probably sunk in: My Chemical Romance are coming to Australia, somehow.
After all, when the news of the reunion first broke, it wasn’t even clear that My Chemical Romance were going to play more than a handful of American shows, let alone that they would be coming down to Australia.

Sometimes these reunions can be a one and done kind of thing — a flash in the pan that is squeezed in around often confused and hectic schedules. Think of the few Eddy Current Suppression Ring gigs that have been dropped since that band officially broke up.
But nup, looks like the emo legends are really committing to this thing. They’ll be playing two headlining gigs at Download Festival, before moving on to New Zealand with old friends Jimmy Eat World.
And nobody can really deal.
In fact, in the hours since the announcement first dropped, the internet has been a mess of emotional, overwhelmed emo fans trying to process a range of complicated feelings.





















Particularly difficult for fans to process is the limited number of dates that the band are playing down here. There will be no Download sideshows — you’ve gotta catch them at a festival, or not at all.
Which is kinda tricky for most dyed-in-the-wool emo fans, who are now feeling old, and uncool, and thoroughly unprepared for standing in the hot sun and drinking overpriced beer.












Of course, there’s still the hope that all of this will result in new music for My Chemical Romance.
The fact that the band are going on something of an international tour means that they’ll be spending a lot of time with one another once again, playing the songs that made them famous. Surely at some point in that process you start thinking, ‘Hey, let’s get a coupla new bangers out’, right?
Right?
