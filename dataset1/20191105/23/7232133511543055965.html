      <h1>Ethereum Nears Massive Resistance Region as On-Chain Volume Surges</h1>
      <address>

      <p>After a long period of trading sideways within the mid-$180 region, Ethereum (ETH) has now begun to incur significant upwards momentum that has pushed it up to $190, which is where it faces some notable resistance that could ultimately push its price lower in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting that this resistance level could halt Ethereum’s rally and possibly lead it to drop significantly lower in the near-term.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Runs Towards $190</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/02/ethereum-may-target-170-in-near-term-as-on-chain-volume-drops-20/">Ethereum</a> is trading up over 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $190, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of $184 that were set during a fleeting sell off experienced by the cryptocurrency yesterday.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that Ethereum is currently pushing up against the price level at which it was rejected at in late-October, which sparked a sell-off that sent it down to the lower-$180 region.</p>
      <p>This upwards movement has come about while Bitcoin continues to trade sideways in the lower-$9,000 region, which is squarely in the middle of the trading range that it has been caught within for the past several days and weeks.</p>
      <p>One interesting fact that should be observed is that the recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/04/microsoft-to-help-enterprises-mint-their-own-ethereum-tokens/">ETH</a> rally has been driven by a massive influx of on-chain trading volume, which has surged over 80% in the past 24-hours according to data from TokenAnalyst.</p>
      <blockquote>“24H #ETH Network Stats: Price: $184.25 (+1.0%). $ETH On-Chain Volume: $400M (+80.8%). Active Senders: 211K (+13.9%). Active Recipients: 97K (+14.2%),” the data group explained in a recent tweet.</blockquote>

      <h3>ETH Nearing a Key Resistance Level that Could Result in a Rejection</h3>
      <p>HornHairs, a popular <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/potential-ethereum-dip-provides-ideal-long-entry-claims-analyst/">cryptocurrency</a> analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes Ethereum may dip lower in the near-term after it pushes up against its “overhead supply” level that exists right around its current price of $190.</p>
      <blockquote>“$ETH low time frame: Price swept and closed below the highs at $187.5, looks ready to drip back down to previous resistance at $184-185. Low time frame demand block that sent price through that level should act as a solid long entry. Target being the supply overhead at $190,” he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>
