      <h1>Chicago Public Schools to plug new budget hole with one-time measures</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:10:01+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) said on Tuesday it would use $134 million in one-time revenue and savings to cover additional spending in its current budget partly because of a tentative contract agreement with its teachers union that ended an 11-day strike.</p>
      <p>The third-largest U.S. public school system also said that increased labor costs in the coming years should be covered by growth in existing state and local revenue.</p>
      <p>CPS' financial outlook improved with a revenue boost starting in fiscal 2018 under a new Illinois school funding law. Escalating pension payments, drained reserves and debt dependency have pushed the district's general obligation credit ratings into junk.</p>
      <p>The yet-to-be-ratified deal reached last week would give teachers an average raise of 16% over five years. It also calls for enforceable increases in staffing of nurses and social workers, as well as a commitment to reduce class sizes.</p>
      <p>The district confirmed last week a cost of as much as $1.5 billion over the life of the contract.</p>
      <p>While the $7.7 billion fiscal 2020 budget the district's board approved in August covered funding for higher teacher salaries and staffing, the final deal increased spending by $33 million.</p>
      <p>An additional $15 million is also needed to cover a new contract with a union representing other school workers. An $86 million gap was caused by other factors including a recent move by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to shift $61 million in pension costs to CPS from the city.</p>
      <p>The district said it would use $68 million in savings from not making up six of the strike days and a $66 million additional allocation of surplus Chicago tax increment funding to cover the higher spending.</p>
      <p>Blake Yocom, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Ratings, which rates CPS BB-minus with a positive outlook, said that while the one-time measures should close the fiscal 2020 budget gap, CPS could face future challenges.</p>
      <p>"It's more the long-term pressure that the contract created," he said.</p>
      <p>Chicago Teachers Union members will vote on the contract next week. The school board has scheduled a Nov. 20 meeting on the labor contracts and revised budget.</p>
