      <p>REUTERS: United States flanker John Quill, who was shown the first red card of the World Cup in Japan, has announced his international retirement, U.S. Rugby said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Quill was sent off in the United States' first Pool C match against England after his shoulder made contact with the head of Owen Farrell in a no-arms tackle.</p>

      <p>The incident sparked a melee between the teams and Quill was subsequently banned for three matches, bringing his tournament to an end as the United States failed to reach the knockout rounds.</p>
      <p>"Every game has been a gift," Quill said in a statement on the USA Rugby website.</p>
      <p>"I feel very lucky to have worn the jersey as many times as I have, the experiences and friendships I've gained along the way I'll carry with me for the rest of my life."</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who was born in County Cork, Ireland, also represented the United States at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>He made his international debut against Russia in 2012 and went on to earn 37 caps for his country, scoring five tries.</p>
      <p>"We are incredibly grateful to John for his contributions to the team over the past several years," U.S. coach Gary Gold said.</p>
      <p>"He has a tremendous work ethic, is a brilliant competitor and his toughness and physicality will be truly missed."</p>
