      <h1>Council leader apologises after 'Ram yer Union up yer hoop' tweetstorm</h1>
      <h2>John Ross also posted a picture of a Union Jack in dog poo and said sorry to anyone who was offended.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:51:12+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Bark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-bark/</a></address>
      <p>Council Leader John Ross has been slammed for sending a controversial tweet with “the perfect answer to our unionist friends”.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ross, councillor for Hamilton South, attended Saturday’s independence rally in Glasgow, where he captured and tweeted two photographs which have since drawn condemnation from opposition councillors.</p>
      <p>The photos highlighted banners on display during the rally, one of which stated: “Ram yer union up yer hoop.” The other depicted a pile of poo with a Union Jack flying from it.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat group leader Robert Brown and Labour group leader Joe Fagan have both criticised the SNP council leader for the tweet.</p>
      <p>Cllr Brown (Rutherglen South) said: “I really don’t know what Councillor Ross is thinking of in pushing these childish and offensive tweets on social media.</p>
      <p>“Sadly it is not the first time we have had such stuff from the SNP leader of South Lanarkshire Council.</p>
      <p>“Unpleasant comments like this show an arrogance and contempt for the views of other people we can do without - people are already bitterly divided by the independence issue and by Brexit without senior SNP representatives stoking the fires of resentment and prejudice.</p>
      <p>“John Ross should recognise the council leader represents everyone and stop being a cheerleader for the more unpleasant parts of his nationalist cause.”</p>

      <p>Cllr Fagan (East Kilbride Central North) added: “John Ross is perfectly entitled to his opinions about independence, but as Leader of the Council he has a responsibility to everyone in South Lanarkshire, whether they voted Yes or No. He needs to remember that before he fires off another one of his tweets.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Ross has deleted the tweet and apologised for sending it in the first place.</p>

      <p>He said: “I was one of the thousands of people who took part in last weekend’s independence rally. My support for independence is well known, having been a member of the SNP since 1973, and I am proud to be part of the campaign for another independence referendum.</p>
      <p>“It is very clear to me that the UK is presently in a mess and that Scotland would be better off out of the Union, and that was the essence of the messages on the posters that I tweeted from the rally.</p>
      <p>“However, the wording and images were not the sort of thing I would use myself and when I had a chance to reflect on this, I decided to delete the tweet from my timeline.</p>
      <p>“I respect that other people may not share my political views and will be careful to take cognisance of this in any future tweets.</p>
      <p>“I am fully committed to doing the best that I can for South Lanarkshire and all its residents, regardless of their political views or none. Certainly, I never intended to offend and my apologies go to anyone who was offended.”</p>
      <p>All councillors are subject to the Standard’s Commission for Scotland’s code of conduct and receive social media advice as part of training based on the code.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ross tweeted from his personal account and did not tweet in connection with his role as leader of South Lanarkshire Council.</p>
      <p>The South Lanarkshire Conservative group were contacted for comment and South Lanarkshire Council declined to comment.</p>
