Persona 5 Scramble (Musou/Warriors) is still on the way, here's what the Protagonist can do
Let's go
05 Nov 2019, 12:30 by Chris Carter
Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers is due in February of next year on PS4 and Switch...in Japan. Yep, despite the west's extreme love for the series it's not seeing a simultaneous release, and might take its sweet time when it comes to a translation.
For now, we can get a closer look at how the Protagonist (read: the Persona 5 hero) plays with a new gameplay clip. Although a lot of that gameplay is filled with cutscenes (it is Persona after all) and platforming, we do get a glimpse at Arsene, which will probably make up a lot of the uniqueness for this subseries (we also get a sneak peek at the RPG systems on top of the hack and slash stuff).
Although the mere mention of a Musou title is enough to make people yawn, it looks pretty legit when it comes to Persona authenticity. It has anime cutscenes! A kickass soundtrack! It's being co-developed by P-Studio, who handles Persona proper!
