      <h1>Microsoft Japan’s Four-Day Working Week Experiment Boosted Productivity By 40%</h1>

        <b>Four days at work, three days off, full salary: Microsoft employees in Japan had a good summer. </b>
      </p>
      <p>During August this year, Microsoft Japan tried out an experiment. Dubbed the Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019, all 2,300 employees were given five Fridays off in a row without any decrease in pay.</p>
      <p>As a result, the tech giant yielded some major benefits: electricity costs fell by 23%, but most importantly of all, productivity was boosted by a massive 40%.</p>

      <p>Due to the longer weekend, 59% fewer pages of paper were printed during the trial. Meeting times were also cut from 60 minutes to 30, with online discussions being encouraged as an alternative to face-to-face; Microsoft Japan previously said in a blog post there was often no reason for meetings to run an hour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Microsoft Japan president and CEO Takuya Hirano said in a statement:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Work a short time, rest well and learn a lot. I want employees to think about and experience how they can achieve the same results with 20% less working time.</blockquote>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the company’s workers were fans – the Work-Life Choice Challenge 2019 Summer experiment was popular with 92% of the staff it surveyed after the trial.</p>

      <p>While the experiment was just a pilot project and there’s no indication whether they will adopt a four-day week, there are plans to implement another iteration of the challenge this winter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/microsoft-japan-four-day-work-week-productivity"><i>The Guardian</i></a>, a Microsoft spokesman said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>In the spirit of a growth mindset, we are always looking for new ways to innovate and leverage our own technology to improve the experience for our employees around the globe.</blockquote>
      <p>This isn’t the first time a four-day week has proved to be a positive change. In 2018, New Zealand trust management company Perpetual Guardian held a similar trial.</p>
      <p>The company found it sparked a 20% rise in employee productivity and a 45% increase in employee work-life balance. Last October, the company decided to permanently adopt the policy.</p>

      <p>A 2017 survey suggested employees across a quarter of Japanese companies were working more than 80 hours overtime a month, often unpaid.</p>
      <p>While a four-day week is a popular desire particularly among young people, a report commissioned by the Labour Party in September this year says it may not be ‘realistic’.</p>

      <p>While the report, conducted by cross-bench peer Robert Skidelsky, agreed it would be ‘good for material and spiritual well-being’, the policy the party is considering would allegedly not be ‘realistic or even desirable’.</p>
      <p>Who to believe – the report saying we should work more, or an experiment saying we should work less? Yeah, that’s a tricky one…</p>
