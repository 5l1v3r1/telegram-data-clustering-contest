        <b>Kieran Tierney has an "ongoing issue" that prompted Arsenal to ask for him not to be called up to the Scotland squad, says manager Steve Clarke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Full-back Tierney, a Â£25m signing from Celtic, made his debut for the Premier League side in late September after double hernia surgery in the summer.</p>
      <p>Scott McKenna and Steven Naismith both return for the Euro 2020 qualifiers with Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal asked us not to select him," Clarke said of Tierney.</p>

      <p>"Kieran has an ongoing issue that Arsenal are keen to address in the next international break.</p>
      <p>"It's a little bit frustrating. It's obviously frustrating for Kieran as well, but we've got good cover in that position."</p>
      <p>Asked about the nature of the 22-year-old's issue, Clarke said: "That's a question for Arsenal."</p>
      <p>Aberdeen defender McKenna and Hearts striker Naismith both sat out last month's defeat by Russia and victory over San Marino because of injury.</p>

      <p>"Steven hasn't had much game-time but he's a good professional and assures me his fitness is good," Clarke said.</p>
      <p>Also back after missing those two matches through injury are Rangers midfielder Ryan Jack, Leeds United defender Liam Cooper and Sheffield United forward Oli McBurnie.</p>
      <p>Wigan Athletic's 44-cap defender Charlie Mulgrew and fellow centre-back Stuart Findlay of Kilmarnock both drop out with hamstring problems. Sporting Kansas City attacker Johnny Russell, whose domestic season is finished, is also omitted.</p>
      <p>Scotland, who cannot qualify from Group I, face Cyprus away on 16 November then Kazakhstan at Hampden three days later.</p>
      <p>Clarke's side can still reach the finals via the play-offs in the spring, and the Scotland manager has made finishing third in the group a "minimum requirement", with Cyprus a point above his side.</p>
      <p>He insists the final two qualifiers are not a time for "experiments" as he seeks to build momentum and cohesion for the play-offs.</p>
