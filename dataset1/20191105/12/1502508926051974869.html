      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 may have upgraded second-generation 108 MP sensor</h1>
      <h2>Back in August, South Korean tech giant announced the world's first 108MP camera sensor.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:52:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>Famed leakster Ice Universe has claimed that the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-samsung">Samsung </a>S11 will not use the 108MP ISOCELL Bright HMX sensor that it launched earlier this year, but will instead utilise an upgraded second-gen sensor.</p>
      <p>Opting for a second-gen version of Samsung's 108MP lens would also make sense, since the original version has on a Xiaomi handset first, so it won't be a totally new thing by the time the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-samsung">Samsung </a>Galaxy S11 launches, Techradar reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Back in August, South Korean tech giant announced the world's first 108MP camera sensor.</p>
      <p>This sensor has been developed through <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-samsung">Samsung </a>and Xiaomi's collaboration and it promises 4-in-1 pixel-binned 27MP photos with heaps of detail,</p>
      <p>In terms of specifications, Galaxy S11 is expected to feature a 20:9 aspect ratio display, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10.</p>
      <p>The smartphone is expected to be powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor and would run Android 10 out of the box.</p>
      <p>A new rumour claims Samsung is working on a new facial recognition system that will likely debut with the Galaxy S11 next year.</p>
