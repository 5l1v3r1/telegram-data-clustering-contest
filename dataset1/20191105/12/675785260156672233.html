      <h2>Parents are going mad for Home Bargains' Christmas Eve boxes - which cost just £2.99 but come filled with lots of little goodies for kids</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:51:20+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> Eve boxes are a great way to get little ones in the mood for the big day, but with so many presents on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-day">Christmas Day,</a> it's best not to spend a fortune for the night before.</p>
      <p>So it's no surprise that parents are going mad for Home Bargain's Christmas Eve boxes, which are packed with festive treats for little ones, and cost just £2.99.</p>
      <p>After spotting the boxes in Home Bargains, one mum shared photos of her find on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , with the post having since amassed over 4,000 likes and almost 2,000 comments.</p>
      <p>Talking about what's inside the box, she also added, it "contains Christmas story book, letter from Santa, door hook, stickers and cookies! Think it's a fab price".</p>

        <figcaption>It's £2.99 and you get the box plus some little goodies</figcaption>

      <p>Originally shared on Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ExtremeCouponingAndBargainsUK/">Extreme Bargaining and Coupons UK,</a> it was then picked up by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10279037/home-bargains-christmas-eve-box/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>However, the popularity of the box has caused some shoppers to stress that there may not be any left for them, commenting "We need a trip to Home Bargains but quickly, before the other 1.8k people get there", with another parent saying they would be "getting them all".</p>
      <p>Elsewhere online you can expect to pay a lot more for a similar item, with <a href="https://amzn.to/2PPPTzi">Amazon selling beautiful pre-filled handmade wooden versions</a> - albeit <a href="https://amzn.to/2PPPTzi">for £28.99.</a></p>

      <p>However, you could certainly use them again and again next year, with the box coming complete with a pillow case, DVD, Hot chocolate, sweets and games.</p>
      <p>You can also personalise the box so that the label it comes with has your little ones name on.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile at John Lewis, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fjohn-lewis-partners-christmas-eve-box-red%2Fp4749218&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fhome-bargains-selling-3-christmas-20815685">a box alone costs £22,</a> coming with nothing inside, and looking very similar to Home Bargain's version.</p>
