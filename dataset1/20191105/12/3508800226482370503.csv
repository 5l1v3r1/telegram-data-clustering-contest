自己的學貸自己還？7個QA看懂韓國瑜「學貸全面免利息」政策爭議
05 Nov 2019, 12:50 by 李秉芳


我們想讓你知道的是韓國瑜國政顧問團批評，明年教育部編列預算共2591億元，民進黨政府現在動輒幾百億的「政策買票」，相比之下全面補貼學貸利息只需要40億根本「小巫見大巫」。



國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜日前表示政府應負責協助青年將學貸利息降至最低，甚至所有銀行都不向學生收任何利息，由政府補貼，韓國瑜的太太李佳芬也對於韓提出的學貸免息，若發生呆帳，表示「政府就把它吃了吧，反正幾千億都浪費了」引發熱議，教育部認為目前已有多項方案幫助需要的學生減免利息、降低還學貸的壓力，不過國民黨則幫韓國瑜的政策辯護，認為政府沒理由推託，應該全面免息。
《自由時報》報導，教育部高教司指出，目前有88萬3000名借學貸的學生，學貸總金額是1832億元，件數是504萬件，1個學生1學期申請1次學貸算1件（大學4年8個學期都申請就算8件），光是今年逾期就有2萬2000件、逾期率為0.38％。去年2018年資料統計則顯示，學貸貸款人平均每人所背負的貸款額度落在28萬到30萬元間，目前負責全台8成以上學貸案件的台灣銀行，自學貸開辦至2018年底累計呆帳共11.8億。學貸很難還嗎？政府該「全面吸收利息」嗎？這樣會花多少錢？以下整理幾個問題幫助大家了解學貸政策爭議。
Q1.申請就學貸款需要什麼資格條件？
台灣的就學貸款主要針對高中以上學生開辦，學貸申請資格有3種：

家庭年收入114萬以下，就學及畢業緩繳期間貸款利息由政府全額補貼。
家庭年收入114萬至120萬，政府補貼半額利息。
家庭年收入超過120萬者，家中有2名以上子女在高中以上學校就讀，才符合申請資格，但不予補貼利息。

就學貸款可申貸項目共有8項，包括學雜費、實習費、書籍費、住宿費、生活費、學生團體保險費、海外研修費，以及電腦及網路通訊使用費等。在生活費部分，具低收入戶資格者，每學期上限4萬元，中低收入戶資格者，每學期上限2萬元。
Q2.韓國瑜的學貸政策是什麼？
韓國瑜日前表示，對年輕人來說最困難的是學生貸款，政府應該負責任讓這些經濟困難的年輕子弟到銀行借錢時，將利息降到最低，甚至所有銀行都不向學生收任何利息，由政府補貼。他也說，政府花再多錢投資年輕人都是值得的，因為投資年輕人就是投資未來。
國政顧問團發言人黃曼昕解釋，韓國瑜主張的是上述第2、3類申請者，在學貸寬限期內由政府全額補貼利息，畢業寬限期過後依然免息。
Q3.借錢唸書，以後怎麼還？
一般而言，學貸有1年的寬限期，亦償還起算日為最後教育階段學業完成後，滿1年之次日開始攤還，而每學期借款有1年的攤還期限（例如大學4年共8學期，故4年學費可分作8年償還）。
據教育部去年統計，學貸貸款人每人所背負的貸款額度平均落在28萬到30萬元之間，根據試算，若就讀大學4年借貸60萬元，欲在8年內還清，則平均每月需償還6545元的就貸本息。
Q4.有哪些現行方案可以減免學貸利息？
現行規範，家庭年所得114萬以下者，「就學期間至畢業後1年內」貸款利息由政府全額補貼，家庭年所得114萬至120萬則半額補貼，120萬以上需自行負擔全額。而利息計算以中華郵政1年期定存機動利率加0.15%浮動計息。
政府於2016年8月調整就學貸款利率基準，一般學生負擔的學貸利率由1.62%降至1.15%，全台將近90萬名的學貸貸款人每年總共減輕負擔新台幣13.62億元。（前總統馬英九時期未曾調整就學貸款利率基準。）
另外行政院去年拍板放寬學貸還款條件，貸款人不論經濟條件為何，皆可申請4年「只繳利息」、緩還本金。假如畢業後一時找不到工作，或是收入低於3萬5000元的青年，可再申請增加4年緩繳期（利息由政府負擔）或延長攤還年限。在緩繳本息期間，無需償還本金，也不用負擔利息，利息由政府幫忙支付，再搭配「只繳息不還本」措施，以一個月要還4000元的學貸為例，約有3700元是本金，就只需繳300元的利息，能大幅減輕還款負擔。目前由政府提供15.4億元補助額度，有將近50萬名以上正在償還就學貸款的青年可申請。


87萬人申請的就學貸款放寬了！最多可四年只繳息、不還本


Q5.學貸「全面免息」要花多少錢？教育部沒這麼做的理由為何？
教育部高教司長朱俊彰表示，目前有學貸貸款人約有88.3萬人，教育部每年用於補貼利息的經費約新台幣23億元，如果要全面補貼，預估每年要再增加16億元經費，這樣大約是接近40億元經費，是在人數不增加的前提下。
朱俊彰也說明，銀行曾評估學貸利息全部由政府補貼，但這麼做恐怕會有「套利風險」，導致本來沒有需求的人也來借學貸，拿這筆錢去做其他投資，進而賺取利潤。
教育部指出，目前超過9成的學貸申請者，都是家庭年收入114萬元以下，如果利息全由政府補貼，各種資格的申請人數勢必增加，連帶加重政府經費負擔。政府希望全面照顧學生，但經費要優先用在真正需要的人，若要推動利息全由政府補貼，預算籌措和風險評估，都需再謹慎思考。
Q6.支持全面免息政策的人怎麼說？
國民黨立法院黨團總召曾銘宗則指出，在80多萬學貸貸款人中，截至去年為止，還不出學貸件數高達39萬8000人（對此教育部澄清，從2003年迄今有數千萬件學貸案，其中有39萬件有逾期情況，39萬是件數而非人數，一個學期申請一次就算一件，有可能是同一個學貸貸款人，且是歷年累積案件數），被聯徵中心註記，並由信保基金代償。
他認為蔡英文政府應該拿出「政治良心」，支持韓國瑜的學貸免息政策。他也不認同學貸現在有「排富條款」，申請學貸還需一定條件才能申請。
國民黨許毓仁則說，教育部質疑這項政策有套利嫌疑，這種說法是侮辱年輕朋友；他認為台灣面臨人才與經濟轉型，消除年輕人的生活壓力，讓他們進入社會後可以免息償還學貸，這樣的作法惠國惠民，應不分黨派一起支持。
國民黨青年部主任蕭敬嚴則以舉自身學貸經歷表示，他的學貸加上利息一個月大約要還7000多元，這對住在台北的社會新鮮人來說，可能就是一個月或半個月的房租，是不小負擔，民進黨不要看到韓國瑜就反對，應思考這個政策的可行性。韓國瑜的國政顧問團則強調，明年教育部編列預算共2591億元，民進黨政府現在動輒幾百億的「政策買票」，相比之下，全面補貼學貸利息只需要40億左右，根本就「小巫見大巫」，只是看政府有沒有重視青年學貸問題。
Q7.目前還不出學貸的造成的「呆帳」有多少？
國內目前共有4家銀行辦理就學貸款，包括台灣銀行、台北富邦銀行、高雄銀行與土地銀行，其中以台銀市占率82.66%為最高，其次為台北富邦的14.13%，高雄銀行3.04%，土地銀行0.17%。
截至去年底為止，承貸全台8成以上學貸案件的台灣銀行，累計學貸呆帳共11.8億。事實上，學貸重擔早已成為全球共業，美國學貸總額已飆破30兆台幣，而日本也來到2.4兆台幣，澳洲拖欠的學貸金額也逾1.2兆台幣，究竟該如何幫助青年有能力償還貸款，確實已成為各國政府棘手的問題。

How about your own loan? 7 QA understand the Korean Yu ""learning loan full interest-free"" policy dispute
05 Nov 2019, 12:50 by Li Bingfang


What we want you to know is that the South Korean Yu’s government advisory group criticized that the Ministry of Education will budget a total of 259.1 billion yuan next year. The DPP government is now mobilizing tens of billions of “policy to buy tickets”, compared to the comprehensive subsidy of interest on school loans. It takes 4 billion yuan to ""see the big witch.""



KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea, said that the government should be responsible for helping young people to minimize interest on school loans. Even all banks do not receive any interest from students. The government subsidies, and the wife of South Korea’s Yu Li, is also exempted from the loan Interest, if a bad debt occurs, it means that ""the government has eaten it, and hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted anyway."" The Ministry of Education believes that there are already many programs to help the students in need to reduce interest and reduce the pressure on returning students. However, the Kuomintang defended the policy of South Korea’s Yu, and believed that the government had no reason to push it and should be fully interest-free.
The Free Times reported that the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education pointed out that there are currently 88 000 students who borrowed students, the total amount of student loans is 183.2 billion yuan, the number is 5.04 million, and one student applies for one loan for one semester. Counting 1 (even if the university applies for 8 semester in 4 years), there are 22,000 cases overdue this year, and the overdue rate is 0.38%. According to the statistics of 2018 last year, the average loan amount of each student loan lender falls between 280,000 and 300,000 yuan. At present, the bank of Taiwan, which is responsible for more than 80% of the student loans in Taiwan, started from the end of 2018. The accumulated bad debts totaled 1.18 billion. Is it hard to pay for school loans? Should the government ""fully absorb interest""? How much does it cost? Here are a few questions to help you understand the school loan policy dispute.
Q1. What qualifications are required to apply for a school loan?
Taiwan’s schooling loans are mainly for high school and above students, and there are three types of student loan application qualifications:

The annual income of the family is less than 1.14 million, and the loan interest during the period of schooling and graduation is fully subsidized by the government.
The family's annual income is 1.14 million to 1.2 million, and the government subsidizes half interest.
If the family has an annual income of more than 1.2 million, more than 2 children in the family will attend the high school or above, and they will be eligible for the application, but will not be subsidized.

There are 8 loan applications for school loans, including tuition and fees, internship fees, book fees, accommodation fees, living expenses, student group insurance premiums, overseas training fees, and computer and network communication fees. In the part of the living expenses, those with low-income households, the upper limit of 40,000 yuan per semester, the qualification of low- and middle-income households, the maximum limit of 20,000 yuan per semester.
Q2. What is the learning loan policy of Korea Yu?
South Korea’s Yu said that the most difficult thing for young people is student loans. The government should be responsible for letting these young people with financial difficulties minimize interest when they borrow money from banks. Even all banks do not charge any interest to students. , subsidized by the government. He also said that it is worthwhile for the government to invest more money in young people because investing in young people is investing in the future.
Huang Manzhen, a spokesperson for the National Government Advisory Group, explained that South Korea’s Yu advocates the above-mentioned Type 2 and Type 3 applicants, who are fully subsidized by the government during the school loan grace period and remain interest-free after the graduation grace period.
Q3. Borrowing money to study, how come back later?
Generally speaking, the student loan has a one-year grace period, and the repayment date is the final education stage. After the completion of the academic year, the next day will be amortized, and the semester loan will have a one-year amortization period (for example, university 4). A total of 8 semesters, so 4 years of tuition can be divided into 8 years to repay).
According to statistics from the Ministry of Education last year, the loan amount of each loan lender is between 280,000 and 300,000 yuan. According to the trial calculation, if you borrow 600,000 yuan from the university for 4 years, you want to pay off within 8 years. On average, the monthly repayment of 6545 yuan is the principal and interest.
Q4. What are the current programs that can reduce the interest on school loans?
According to the current regulations, if the annual income of the family is less than 1.14 million, the loan interest will be fully subsidized by the government during the period from school to one year after graduation. The annual income of the family will be 1.14 million to 1.2 million, and the full amount of subsidy will be more than 1.2 million. The interest calculation is based on Chunghwa Post's one-year fixed-rate mobile rate plus 0.15% floating interest.
In August 2016, the government adjusted the benchmark interest rate for school loans. The student interest rate for general students was reduced from 1.62% to 1.15%. Nearly 900,000 student loan lenders in Taiwan reduced the total burden of NT$1,362 million. (Previous President Ma Ying-jeou did not adjust the benchmark for studying loan interest rates during the period.)
In addition, the Executive Yuan last year relaxed the conditions for loan repayment. The lenders can apply for four years of ""only paying interest"" and repay the principal regardless of the economic conditions. If you can't find a job after graduation, or if you earn less than 35,000 yuan, you can apply for a four-year overdue period (interest is paid by the government) or extend the amortization period. During the period of deferred payment of interest and interest, there is no need to repay the principal, and there is no need to pay interest. The interest is paid by the government, and the ""only pay interest is not repaid"" measure, taking the loan of 4,000 yuan a month as an example, about 3700 If the yuan is the principal, you only need to pay 300 yuan of interest, which can greatly reduce the burden of repayment. At present, the government provides a subsidy of 1.54 billion yuan, and nearly 500,000 young people who are repaying their school loans can apply.


The schooling loan for 870,000 people has been relaxed! Can only pay interest for up to four years, not repaying this


Q5. How much does it cost to study “full interest-free”? What are the reasons why the Ministry of Education did not do this?
Zhu Junzhang, director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, said that there are currently about 883,000 student loan lenders. The Ministry of Education’s annual subsidy for interest is about NT$2.3 billion. If full subsidy is required, it is estimated to increase by another 1.6 billion each year. The yuan is funded in such a way that it is close to 4 billion yuan, which is based on the premise that the number does not increase.
Zhu Junzhang also stated that the bank has assessed that the interest on the loan is all subsidized by the government, but there is probably a “arbitrage risk” in doing so, so that people who have no need to borrow will also borrow money to make other investments and earn money. Take profits.
The Ministry of Education pointed out that at present, more than 90% of student applicants are households with an annual income of less than 1.14 million yuan. If the interest is fully subsidized by the government, the number of applicants for various qualifications will increase, which will increase the government's financial burden. The government hopes to take care of the students in full, but the funds must be given priority to those who really need it. If the interest is to be subsidized by the government, budget raising and risk assessment, we need to think carefully.
Q6. What do people who support the comprehensive interest-free policy say?
Zeng Mingzong, the general assembly of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan Party Committee, pointed out that among the more than 800,000 student loan lenders, as of last year, there were no more than 398,000 students who had no school loans (the Ministry of Education clarified that there have been thousands since 2003). In the case of 10,000 cases of study loans, 390,000 cases were overdue, and 390,000 were for the number rather than the number of people. One application for one semester is one, which may be the same student loan lender, and the cumulative number of cases over the years). It was noted by the Alliance Center and was reimbursed by the Xinbao Fund.
He believes that the Tsai-English government should come up with a ""political conscience"" to support South Korea's Yu's interest-free policy. He also disagrees that there is now a ""rich wealth clause"" for student loans. It is only necessary to apply for a loan to apply for a loan.
The Kuomintang Xu Yiren said that the Ministry of Education has questioned the arbitrage of this policy. This is an insult to young friends; he believes that Taiwan faces a talent and economic transformation, eliminates the pressure on young people’s lives, and allows them to repay their loans without interest. Such a practice of Huiguo Huimin should be supported by the parties.
Xiao Jingyan, director of the Kuomintang Youth Department, said that his study loan plus interest is about 7,000 yuan a month, which may be one month or half a month for the fresh people living in Taipei. Rent is not a small burden. The DPP should not see South Korea’s opposition, and should consider the feasibility of this policy. South Korea’s National Government Advisory Group stressed that the Ministry of Education will budget a total of 259.1 billion yuan next year. The DPP government is now squeezing tens of billions of “policy to buy tickets”. In contrast, the comprehensive subsidy of interest on school loans only needs about 4 billion yuan. It is simply that ""the little witch sees the big witch"", just to see if the government has attached importance to the issue of youth student loans.
Q7. How many “bad debts” are there due to the lack of student loans?
There are currently 4 banks in China that handle school loans, including Bank of Taiwan, Taipei Fubon Bank, Kaohsiung Bank and Land Bank. Among them, Taiwan’s market share is 82.66%, followed by Taipei’s Fubang’s 14.13% and Kaohsiung Bank’s 3.04%. The land bank is 0.17%.
As of the end of last year, the Bank of Taiwan, which has mortgaged more than 80% of all student loans, has accumulated a total of 1.18 billion yuan in bad loans. In fact, the burden of learning loans has already become a global business. The total amount of US student loans has already exceeded 30 trillion US dollars, while Japan has also reached 2.4 trillion Taiwan dollars. Australia’s arrears of school loans have also exceeded 1.2 trillion dollars. How can we help young people? The ability to repay loans has indeed become a difficult issue for governments.
