      <p>I'm amazed how many features Apple builds into iOS, and then just leaves them hidden for me to find. Here are a crop of tips and tricks for working with words on your iPhone or iPad.<br/><br/>All of these are spectacularly useful, and once you've used them a few times you'll be amazed how easy and natural they feel.<br/><br/><b>Must read: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eight-things-i-love-about-ios/"><b>Eight things I love about iOS</b></a></p>
      <h3>Tip #1: Text selection</h3>
      <p>iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 gives you very fine control over text selection using taps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Double tap: Select a word</li>
        <li>Triple tap: Select a sentence</li>
        <li>Quadruple tap: Select a paragraph</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tip #2: Undo and redo</h3>
      <p>These often-used functions get a long-awaited revamp:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swipe left with three fingers to undo</li>
        <li>Swipe right with three fingers to redo</li>
        <li>You can also use a three-finger double-tap to undo, which feels a little bit awkward initially but soon becomes second nature.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tip #3: Copy, cut, and paste</h3>
      <p>Now we're getting advanced. I recommend practicing these on some scrap text before using them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pinch in with three fingers to copy</li>
        <li>Pinch in with three fingers twice to cut</li>
        <li>Pinch out (or unpinch!!) with three fingers to paste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tip #4: Moving the cursor</h3>
      <p>Just place your finger on the cursor and move it. Think of it as picking it up and dropping it down somewhere else. So simple, yet it took me a while to figure it out (I was jabbing at the screen too hard).</p>
