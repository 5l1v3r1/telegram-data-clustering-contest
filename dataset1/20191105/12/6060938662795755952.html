      <p>MUMBAI: The players' auction for the next <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipl">Indian Premier League</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a>) will be held on December 19 in Kolkata, the event's governing council decided in a meeting on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The glitzy league is usually held in April-May every year and players' auction is being conducted in Kolkata for the first time. The city is the home ground of the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned Kolkata Knight Riders franchise.</p>
      <p>"The IPL auction will be in Kolkata on December 19. It's a departure from the traditional venue of Bengaluru," an IPL governing council member said on conditions of anonymity after the meeting here.</p>
      <p>While the franchises were allotted Rs 82 crore each for IPL 2019, Rs 85 crore per team has been earmarked for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Every franchise will also have an additional purse of Rs three crore in addition to the balance in their kitties from the last auction.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Delhi-Capitals">Delhi Capitals</a> have the biggest balance -- Rs 8.2 crore, followed by Rajasthan Royals at Rs 7.15 crore and Kolkata Knight Riders at Rs 6.05 crore.</p>
      <p>This year's auction is the last one before the franchises disband and prepare to assemble fresh squads from 2021 at a mega auction.</p>
      <p>Funds left with franchises ahead of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IPL-2020">IPL 2020</a> auction:</p>
      <p>Chennai Super Kings - Rs 3.2 crore, Delhi Capitals - Rs 8.2 crore, Kings XI Punjab - Rs 3.7 crore, Kolkata Knight Riders - Rs 6.05 crore, Mumbai Indians - Rs 3.55 crore, Rajasthan Royals - Rs 7.15 crore, Royal Challengers Bangalore - Rs 1.80 crore, Sunrisers Hyderabad - Rs 5.30 crore.</p>
