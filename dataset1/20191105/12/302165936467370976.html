      <p>VIENNA, Nov 5 — Opec Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said today that the oil market outlook for 2020 may have upside potential, appearing to downplay any need for deeper cuts to production.</p>
      <p>The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia meet in December to review output policy. The so-called Opec+ alliance has since January implemented a deal to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day to support the market. The pact runs to March 2020.</p>
      <p>“Based on the preliminary numbers, 2020 looks like it will have upside potential,” Barkindo told a briefing.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he was more optimistic about the market than he had been in October, when he had said all options were open including a deeper cut, Barkindo replied that the picture had improved.</p>
      <p>“There are definitely brighter spots. The outlook as we get closer to 2020... The numbers are looking more refined and the picture is looking brighter,” he said.</p>
      <p>On whether the market looked oversupplied for next year, Barkindo said: “We are not there yet. It is not possible for us at the moment to pre-empt all processes” of reviewing the market before the December meeting.</p>
      <p>Barkindo also said Brazil would be welcome to join the oil producer group but the country had not yet made an official request to do so.</p>
      <p>“They would be most welcome to join,” Barkindo told reporters, adding that consultations had taken place in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said last month that he wants his country to join Opec, a move that would add the most significant new producer to the oil cartel for years but met with scepticism in Brazil’s energy industry.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Tuesday Opec released its 2019 World Oil Outlook, in which the producer group said it would supply a diminishing amount of oil in the next five years as output of US shale and other rival sources expanded. — Reuters</p>
