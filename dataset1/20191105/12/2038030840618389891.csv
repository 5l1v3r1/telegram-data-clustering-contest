Cape Town - Filming for The Eternals came to a halt when an unexploded bomb was found near the set in Spain.
According to reports the cast and crew which includes Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden had to be evacuated and taken to safety in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands.
The DailyMail reports that the explosive could have been leftover from a Nazi World War II base.
According to The Sun, experts were brought in to disarm and remove the bomb.
A source told the publication: ""It was obviously terrifying — the bomb could have been there for decades untouched but who knows what might have happened if it was disturbed.""
Cameras started rolling on the Marvel title in England in October.
It centres on the Eternals, an immortal alien race created by the Celestials, who protect humanity from their evil counterparts, the Deviants.
Other cast members include Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek and Gemma Chan.
The film is set to be released in November 2020.
