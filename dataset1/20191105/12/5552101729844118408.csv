民視八點檔《多情城市》如火如荼拍攝，男主角傅子純獻出許多武打大場面，沒想到因此被操瘦了3公斤，甚至左手的小拇指不慎被打到骨頭錯位。另一組動作戲多的就屬於侯怡君跟德馨，兩人從潑水站晉升成麵粉大戰，侯怡君敬佩德馨最近為了「小三玉蓮」的角色，犧牲演出，除了把臉塗黑遊街，還被豬血水潑滿全身，仍敬業演出。
傅子純表示拍武打戲現在很上手，可能也是因為大量動作戲的關係，讓他身材可以維持得宜。日前收到在工廠外拍攝武打戲，打鬥過程還要點燃大火，引起爆炸，傅子純表示拍攝之前完全不會緊張，，因為知道劇有做好萬全的防護措施，反而較擔心武術指導的安全，為了戲劇張力以及畫面好看都是來真的，而演員只要盡情耍帥就好。

另一方面劇中最受關注的三角關係，劇中侯怡君發現介入家庭的德馨竟然直接踏到家裡來欺負女兒，讓她不得不反擊，硬生生把水潑到德馨身上，侯怡君表示為了拍攝可以一次ok，大家就盡全力來完成，還放膽要大家把麵粉灑向她，只是因為地上先潑水了，兩人笑說：「好像在冰上打鬥，地面超滑的」，幸好大家都撐過來了！
