      <p>Last month we <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomi-to-release-its-apple-watch-clone-next-month/">reported</a> that Xiaomi is entering the smartwatch market with the new Mi Watch. At a press event today, Xiaomi officially announced the new Mi Watch. As expected, it is an Apple Watch clone running WearOS by Google. Like Mi smartphones, instead of using the plain WearOS, Xiaomi has developed MIUI for Watch to clone many Apple WatchOS features and apps.</p>
      <p>Hardware wise, the Mi Watch features a 44 mm square aluminium alloy body and a 1.78-inch AMOLED display with a pixel density of 326dpi. Like Apple Watch, you can find a crown and a button on the right side of the watch. The Mi Watch is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 3100 platform and supports LTE connectivity through eSim. It also comes with WiFi, NFC, Bluetooth and GPS.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi promises more than 100 watch faces at launch and it will support custom always-on watch faces as well. Xiaomi is claiming that this watch will offer up to 36 hours of battery life with LTE enabled.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Mi Watch will be available in China from November 11, starting at CNY 1,299 ($185 USD). There will be a special edition Mi Watch with Saphhire Glass, stainless steel body, and stainless steel chain strap. This special edition will cost CNY 1,999 ($285 USD).</p>
