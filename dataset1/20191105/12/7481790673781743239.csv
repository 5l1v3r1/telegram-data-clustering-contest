家族３人殺害事件、検察側は夫婦仲悪化を強調…妻から叱責受け「死んでほしい」

05 Nov 2019, 12:50

　福岡県小郡（おごおり）市で２０１７年、妻子３人を殺害したとして、殺人罪に問われた元県警通信指令課巡査部長、中田充（みつる）被告（４１）の裁判員裁判の初公判が５日、福岡地裁（柴田寿宏裁判長）であり、中田被告は「間違いなく冤罪（えんざい）です」と無罪を主張した。検察側は動機になり得る事情として、被告が妻に不満を抱いていたことなどを指摘した。
　犯行を示す直接的な証拠はなく、検察側は冒頭陳述で、中田被告に新しい傷があり、妻・由紀子さん（当時３８歳）の首から採取した微物のＤＮＡ型が被告と一致したことや、事件があった自宅に第三者が侵入した形跡がないことなどを状況証拠に挙げた。さらに、犯行動機になり得る事情として夫婦仲の悪化を強調。中田被告が、由紀子さんから生活態度について注意や叱責（しっせき）を受け、同僚に「死んでほしい」と漏らしていたなどと主張した。
　一方、弁護側は「夫婦仲は良くなかったが、殺害の動機につながらない」と反論し、「証拠を積み重ねても、被告が犯人とは断定できない」と無罪を主張した。
　起訴状では、中田被告は１７年６月５日深夜から同６日未明、同市の自宅で、由紀子さん、小学４年の長男・涼介君（同９歳）、同１年の長女・実優（みゆ）さん（同６歳）の首を圧迫したり、絞めたりして殺害したとしている。被告は起訴後、懲戒免職になった。
