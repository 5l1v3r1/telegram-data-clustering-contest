法輪功學員戚秀梅被劫持19個月 下落不明

05 Nov 2019, 12:57

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】黑龍江省鶴崗市寶泉嶺法輪功學員戚秀梅於2018年3月30日被非法抓捕、至今已被非法關押19個月。家人不知其下落，只知道從她的工資卡上1萬元錢已被轉走。
明慧網報導，戚秀梅遭綁架後被關押到寶泉嶺看守所，這次是她第三次遭綁架。家人曾幾次到寶泉嶺看守所，但一直不讓見她，除了能給她存錢。有消息稱寶泉嶺看守所被撤銷後，戚秀梅被轉至鶴崗看守所迫害。
據悉，構陷戚秀梅的黑材料已由寶泉嶺公安局轉交至臭名昭著的黑龍江省農墾建三江管理局檢察院。有消息稱現在黑龍江農墾系統迫害法輪功學員的案件都統一轉移給農墾建三江管理局檢察院受理。
2018年3月30日下午5點多鐘，寶泉嶺農墾公安局國保隊長修士勛夥同幾人，其中有兩個著裝的警察，一名叫李紅（音），還有一社區人員，在戚秀梅家樓下單元門前圖謀迫害她，當時她沒在家。
這夥人後來綁架了回家的戚秀梅，藉口是監控到她曾經散發了法輪功真相傳單，並對她家進行了非法蒐查，把她劫持到寶泉嶺看守所迫害。
戚秀梅，出生於1964年，家住寶泉嶺丁香路，是黑龍江省寶泉嶺管理局直屬小學教師。1999年她開始修煉法輪功後，按「真、善、忍」的標準要求自己，不斷提高自己的道德水準。
在中共迫害法輪功以後，戚秀梅不放棄修煉，於2007年2月遭綁架，被非法關押迫害30天。
寶泉嶺管理局直屬小學助紂為虐，取消了戚秀梅的教師資格，把她降職為保潔員，強迫她打掃衛生。儘管承受了很大的屈辱和不公正的待遇，但戚秀梅修煉法輪功的心堅如磐石。
2011年8月下旬，黑龍江寶泉嶺農墾局管理公安分局十多個警察在警察張樹鵬的帶領下，翻牆闖入法輪功學員李桂雲家中，綁架了戚秀梅、李桂雲、趙洪玉、劉洪斌、劉貴、呂成英等八名法輪功學員。
2012年4月19日，黑龍江寶泉嶺農墾法院對戚秀梅、劉洪斌、劉貴等六名法輪功學員進行非法庭審。
北京律師在法庭上為法輪功學員做了精采的無罪辯護，認為：如果以《憲法》為準繩衡量，參與構陷、誣判這幾位法輪功學員的警察、檢察院工作人員、法官是在光天化日之下踐踏國家法律，是在知法犯法和違法犯罪。
直接參與濫用法律構陷、迫害這幾位法輪功學員的人員有：徐敏（公訴人）、關爽（審判長）、潘洪君（審判員）、黃學昆（審判員）、林倩（書記員）等；構陷這幾位法輪功學員的所謂證人有：趙業華、韓俊秋、董茂權、史有英、郜建國、陳丙山、徐樹傑、李愛梅。
2012年5月10日，六名法輪功學員被非法判刑。戚秀梅被非法判刑4年、趙洪玉5年、李桂雲4年半、劉洪斌3年、呂成英2年、劉貴1年。
8月2日，戚秀梅、趙洪玉、李桂雲和呂成英一同被綁架到黑龍江省女子監獄。
黑龍江省女子監獄對不放棄信仰的法輪功學員進行迫害的手段包括：剝奪睡眠、逼看歪曲事實的錄像、酷刑折磨等。
戚秀梅等法輪功學員在黑龍江省女子監獄被犯人包夾（寸步不離地監管）、辱罵，身心遭受摧殘。
戚秀梅在11監區每天被迫做奴工，於2015年8月從黑龍江省女子監獄出獄回家。

Falun Gong practitioner Yan Xiumei was hijacked for 19 months. His whereabouts are unknown.

05 Nov 2019, 12:57

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Falun Gong practitioner Yan Xiumei of Baoquanling, Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province was illegally arrested on March 30, 2018, and has been illegally detained for 19 months. The family did not know its whereabouts, only knowing that 10,000 yuan from her salary card had been transferred.
Minghui.com reported that after being kidnapped, Yan Xiumei was detained at the Baoquanling Detention Center. This time she was kidnapped for the third time. The family had visited the Baoquanling detention center several times, but she never let her see her, except that she could save her money. It was reported that after the Baoquanling Detention Center was revoked, Yan Xiumei was transferred to the Hegang Detention Center for persecution.
It is reported that the black material that has been trapped by Yu Xiumei has been transferred from the Baoquanling Public Security Bureau to the infamous Heilongjiang Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Sanjiang Administration Procuratorate. It is reported that the cases of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners by the Heilongjiang Land Reclamation System are now transferred to the Agricultural Reclamation Construction Sanjiang Administration Procuratorate.
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon of March 30, 2018, the guardian of the National Security Team of Baoquanling Agricultural Reclamation Bureau had several people, including two dressed policemen, one named Li Hong, and one community member. In front of the unit of the Xiu Mei Meijia downstairs, she tried to persecute her, when she was not at home.
The group later kidnapped the returning home, Xiu Xiumei. The excuse was to monitor that she had distributed Falun Gong truth flyers and illegally searched her home and hijacked her to the Baoquanling detention center for persecution.
Yan Xiumei, born in 1964, lives in Polan Road, Baoquanling, and is a primary school teacher directly under the Baoquanling Administration of Heilongjiang Province.

Beijing lawyers have made a brilliant innocence defense for Falun Gong practitioners in court. They believe that if the Constitution is used as a yardstick, the police, procuratorate staff and judges involved in the construction and punishment of these Falun Gong practitioners will be trampled in broad daylight. National laws are about breaking the law and breaking the law.
Those directly involved in the abuse of law to frame and persecute these Falun Gong practitioners include: Xu Min (public prosecutor), Guan Shuang (presiding judge), Pan Hongjun (judge), Huang Xuekun (judge), Lin Qian (clerk), etc. The so-called witnesses of these Falun Gong practitioners are: Zhao Yehua, Han Junqiu, Dong Maoquan, Shi Youying, Yan Jianguo, Chen Bingshan, Xu Shujie, Li Aimei.
On May 10, 2012, six Falun Gong practitioners were illegally sentenced. Yan Xiumei was sentenced illegally for 4 years, Zhao Hongyu for 5 years, Li Guiyun for 4 and a half years, Liu Hongbin for 3 years, Lu Chengying for 2 years, and Liu Gui for 1 year.
On August 2, Yan Xiumei, Zhao Hongyu, Li Guiyun and Lu Chengying were kidnapped to the Women's Prison in Heilongjiang Province.
The methods used by the women’s prisons in Heilongjiang Province to persecute Falun Gong practitioners who do not give up their faith include: deprivation of sleep, obsessive video of distorted facts, torture and torture.
Falun Gong practitioners such as Yan Xiumei were detained by prisoners in the women’s prison in Heilongjiang Province (inseparable from the ground), insulted, and physically and mentally devastated.
Yan Xiumei was forced to work as a slave worker every day in the 11th district. He was released from the Heilongjiang Women's Prison in August 2015.
