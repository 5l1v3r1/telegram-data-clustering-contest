【採訪現場】連番挑釁記者的蒙面警長，以及宣稱「未聽過第四權」的警察
05 Nov 2019, 12:15 by Kayue


我們想讓你知道的是有警長在執行職務期間不斷挑釁記者，質疑記者身份，亦有警員聲稱「沒有第四權」這回事，要求記者不要阻礙警察執行職務。



11月2日晚上11時40分左右，銅鑼灣一隊防暴警察從崇光百貨位置沿記利佐治街推進，估據馬路及行人路，我以及其他記者在旁跟隨拍攝。
期間一位警長不斷挑釁我前面的記者，包括質疑「有無關機㗎你？機都無開」、「鏡頭都未開」（實際上有開），記者則回應「咩未開？阿sir你啲智力真係一流」。該警長又叫記者「揸好啲（相機）啦，揸個鏡頭又話自己係記者」，警長旁的警員則搭嘴說︰「職業無分貴賤，垃圾始終都係垃圾。」
快到告士打道時，警長再質疑記者身分︰「著件嘢（反光衣）又喺度扮記者」，並對前面倒後走路持大型攝錄機的記者說︰「嗱呢個哥哥我信你係喇，但你小心仆街喎」。
警隊自6月起已多次因未有於制服展示警員編號、拒絕出示委任證而受到批評。早前警方公布，參與處理示威行動的警員要佩戴「行動呼號」白色卡片作識別，但仍有不少警員拒絕遵守規定。[1]
從畫面可見，挑釁記者的警長頭盔上編號為「EU 4 SGT」，胸口前掛上的「行動呼號」則是「EU HKI 1/1」，而HKI後似乎有一個數字。



防暴警員在記利佐治街及告士打道交界停下約十多秒便繼續前進，當時告士打道有一對男女被其他警員截查，記者則前往拍攝，另外有蒙面防暴警察迅速上前，呼喝「記者走開」。
搜身及搜袋期間，男子與在場警員本來沒有身體接觸，但他挨往石壆方向時，防暴警反應激烈，立即將他制服並帶上警車。《蘋果日報》拍攝到這一幕︰



那時候我以及其他記者均有上前拍攝，畫面可見到有三名警員嘗試制服男子，另外有七名警員及被截查女子在旁。記者在這些警察後拍攝，未有阻礙任何警員執行職務，同時旁邊有輛警車停泊在馬路上，車輛無法駛過，因此記者站在該處亦未有阻塞交通。
突然一位蒙名防暴警察上前驅趕記者，要求記者上回行人路，並用警棍推撞記者。蒙面警員頭盔及背心印有編號「STR-B3」，未有掛出委任證、行動呼號卡，制服上亦不見警員編號。我嘗試問他的警員編號，但他當時已遠離相信未有聽到。
此時，早前挑釁記者、行動呼號「EU HKI 1/1」的警長在旁問「乜嘢編號呀？」並叫記者後退，當時他胸前的行動呼號卡紙摺了一角。我指出是按《警察通例》（第20-03條）要求須提供的警員編號，該警長未有回應。
同時，在記利佐治街指記者「垃圾始終都係垃圾」的警員再次搭嘴，問記者「咩第四權呀？我未聽過啵」，我要求他除下面罩再說一次，他宣稱「無第四權呢樣嘢㗎，唔好阻礙我哋執行職務呀」。另一位蒙面警員叫其他警員上車，這位警員於是離開。從影片畫面及搭嘴警員的於記利佐治街推進時的位置判斷，其行動呼號相信是「EU HKI 1/2」。



根據《警察通例》第39章〈警察與市民和傳播媒介的關係〉第39-05條「如何配合傳媒工作」，在事發現場的人員，須「以互諒互讓的態度，盡量配合傳媒工作」以及「不應妨礙傳媒的攝錄工作」。
近月不少在示威現場拍攝的記者均受到前線警員無禮甚至暴力對待，包括推撞記者、在未有示威者的情況下向記者噴胡椒噴劑[2]、用警棍揮打[3]、投擲催淚彈、以水炮車射水[4]甚至拘捕記者[5]等，印尼記者Verby Mega Indah右眼更受槍傷失去視力[6]。不同的傳媒組織、機構已多次譴責警方對待記者的手法，然而未見改善。[7][8][9]
10月28日，有記者在警方記者會上讀聲明，批評警方暴力對待新聞工作者，並用電筒照向警方高層，警方暫停記者會並將該記者驅逐離場。[10]昨日（11月4日）警方記者會上，有在場記者戴上分別有「查警暴止警謊」六字的頭盔作無聲抗議，主持記者會的警察公共關係科警司高振邦要求六位記者離開不果，取消記者會。[11]
翻查記錄，9月9日香港記者協會和攝影記者協會呼籲出席記者會的記者穿戴防護裝備，並在記者會開始前由記協代表宣讀聲明，譴責警方濫用武力、惡意針對記者阻礙採訪，當時警方未有阻止，宣讀聲明期間警方高層亦在現場。[12]

[Interview scene] Masked sergeant who repeatedly provoked reporters, and police officers who claimed to have ""not heard of the fourth power""
05 Nov 2019, 12:15 by Kayue


What we want you to know is that the police chief constantly provokes reporters during his duties, questioning the identity of journalists, and some police officers claim that ""there is no fourth power"" and ask journalists not to obstruct the police from performing their duties.



At about 11:40 pm on November 2nd, a group of riot police in Causeway Bay proceeded from the location of Sogo Department Store along the Great George Street. It was estimated that the road and the footpath, I and other reporters followed the filming.
During the period, a sheriff constantly provoked reporters in front of me, including questioning that ""there is no machine to you, the machine is not open"", ""the camera is not open"" (actually open), and the reporter responds to ""I haven't opened it? Really first class."" The sheriff also called the reporter ""揸好啲 (camera), and a camera and a reporter."" The police officer next to the sheriff said, ""The occupation is not expensive, and the garbage is always rubbish.""
As soon as Gloucester Road was approached, the sheriff questioned the identity of the reporter again. ""There was a smashing (reflective vest) and a reporter,"" said the reporter who had walked behind and held a large video camera. ""Hey, my brother, I I believe that you are a la, but you are careful to squat.""
Since June, the Police Force has been repeatedly criticized for failing to display the police officer's number in uniform and refusing to produce the warrant card. Earlier, the police announced that police officers involved in handling demonstrations should wear a ""call sign"" white card for identification, but many police officers refused to comply with the regulations. [1]
As can be seen from the picture, the police officer's helmet on the prostitute is numbered ""EU 4 SGT"", and the ""call sign"" on the chest is ""EU HKI 1/1"", and there seems to be a number after the HKI.



The riot police stopped at the junction of Great George Street and Gloucester Road for about 10 seconds. At that time, a pair of men and women were intercepted by other police officers at Gloucester Road. Reporters went to filming and a masked riot police quickly went on. Before, call ""the reporter walks away.""
During the search and bag search, the man had no physical contact with the police officers present, but when he went to the direction of Shijie, the riot police reacted fiercely and immediately subdued him and took him to the police car. ""Apple Daily"" filmed this scene:



At that time, I and other reporters all took photos. It was revealed that three police officers tried to subdue the men. In addition, seven police officers and the intercepted women were next to them. The reporters photographed after these police officers did not prevent any police officers from performing their duties. At the same time, a police car parked on the road next to them and the vehicles could not pass, so the reporter stood there and did not block traffic.
Suddenly a famous riot police stepped forward to drive the reporter and asked the reporter to go back to the pedestrian road and use the baton to push the reporter. The masked police officer's helmet and vest are printed with the number ""STR-B3"". There is no certificate of appointment or action call card. The police officer's number is not visible on the uniform. I tried to ask his police officer number, but he was far away from believing that he had not heard it.
At this time, the sergeant who provoked the reporter and the call sign ""EU HKI 1/1"" earlier asked the ""乜嘢号?"" and called the reporter back. At that time, the call sign on his chest was folded. I pointed out that the police officer number required to be provided under the Police General Order (Section 20-03) did not respond.
At the same time, in the Georgetown Street, the police officer said that the ""garbage is always rubbish"" police again, asked the reporter ""Hey fourth power? I have not heard of it"", I asked him to repeat the mask, he declared ""If there is no fourth power, it will hinder me from performing my duties."" Another masked police officer called the other police officers to board the bus. The police officer then left. Judging from the position of the film screen and the police officer's Yu Kee Lee Street, the call sign is believed to be ""EU HKI 1/2"".



According to Section 39 of the Police General Rules, ""The Relationship between the Police and the Citizens and the Media"", ""How to Cooperate with the Media"", the staff at the scene of the incident must ""work as closely as possible with the media"". And ""should not hinder the media's video recording work"".
In recent months, many reporters who filmed at the demonstration site were rude and even violently treated by frontline police officers, including pushing reporters and spraying pepper spray on reporters without demonstrators [2], using batons to slap [3] ], throwing tear gas, water guns to shoot water [4] and even arrested reporters [5], etc., Indonesian journalist Verby Mega Indah's right eye was more affected by gunshot wounds [6]. Different media organizations and organizations have repeatedly condemned the police's approach to journalists, but no improvement has been made. [7][8][9]
On October 28, a reporter read a statement at the police press conference, criticized the police for violently treating journalists, and flashed the torch to the top of the police. The police suspended the press conference and expelled the reporter from the scene. [10] Yesterday (November 4), at the police press conference, there were reporters wearing a helmet with a ""charging police lie"" and a silent protest. The police public relations department superintendent Gao Zhenbang presided over the press conference. Six reporters were asked to leave and cancel the press conference. [11]
Looking up records, on September 9th, the Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Photojournalist Association called on journalists attending the press conference to wear protective equipment. Before the press conference began, the reporters read the statement and condemned the police for using force and maliciously blocking the interview. The police did not stop, and the police high-level officials were also present at the scene. [12]
