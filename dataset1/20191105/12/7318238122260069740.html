      <h1>Santiago protests take toll on Chile economy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:40:11+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Julien Bonetti</a></address>
      <p>Protesters clashed with police on the streets of Santiago on Monday (November 4), amid ongoing public anger that began with an increase in the price of metro fares.</p>
      <p>Riots, demonstrations and acts of arson, much have reflected larger and long-simmering anger at the government's failure to alter Chile's economic course despite growing inequality, have resulted in at least 18 dead and 7,000 arrests, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Chilean businesses lost more than $1.4 billion while the city's metro suffered nearly $400 million in damages.</p>
      <p>Chile's newly appointed finance minister, Ignacio Briones, said on Monday the economy will likely grow between 2.0% and 2.2% in 2019, down from a prior forecast for 2.6% growth following more than two weeks of protests in the Andean nation.</p>
      <p>Chile is one of Latin America's wealthiest nations, but also, among its most unequal.</p>
      <p>Frustrations over the high cost of living in Santiago have become a political flashpoint and have prompted calls for reforms on everything from the country's tax and labour codes to its pension system.</p>
