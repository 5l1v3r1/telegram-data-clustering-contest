美團股價曾高見100元
同股不同權港股獲納入滬深港通後，相關股份造好。其中美團（3690）續破頂，今早終成為紅底股，股價曾高見100元。信誠證券聯席董事張智威表示，美團最厲害之處在於由2015年至今的收入都每每以雙位數字、甚至以倍數增長，收入非常強勁！另外，其股東應佔溢利雖然之前有過百億虧損，但隨著其收入不斷增加及成本的壓縮，已由原本過百億虧損到現在最新只有5億的虧損。

美團點評（3690）以同股不同權形式掛牌，今早終成為紅底股，股價曾高見100元，若以歷來高位100元計算，美團在今年內累計升幅達1.28倍。

美團最新追揸沽攻略
他預計美團業績未來趨勢向好，加上現時大眾都逐漸習慣於網上「叫外賣」服務，張智威認為美團很有機會轉虧為盈。他續指，由於大行對其估值都高於100元以上，所以他認為現階段約96.8元水平價位「可以買入」，目標價為110元。如果已有貨在手，可考慮當股價升至100元以上才逐步沽出，投資者亦可作中線持有，直至美團公布下一期業績時，股價更有機會再升。
宏滙資產管理董事及投資策略總監林嘉麒則表示，雖然美團今日見過100元後回落，但短線再上機會大，有貨可繼續持有。冇貨在手可於93元開始吸納，先看目標108元。
