Portugal international Gomes had surgery on Monday and Everton said afterwards he was expected to make a full recovery.
Referee Martin Atkinson showed Son a red card for his tackle on Gomes and the Premier League said after the match that he had been dismissed for ""endangering the safety of a player"".
Both the BBC and the Guardian reported that Spurs had appealed to the Football Association asking for the red card to be rescinded.
South Korea international Son, who was in tears in the dressing room after the match, will be banned for Tottenham's next three Premier League matches against Sheffield United, West Ham and Bournemouth if the appeal is unsuccessful.
