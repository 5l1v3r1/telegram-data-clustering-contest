      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:02:06+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Coussins, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/jordan-coussins/</a></address>
      <p>A disgraced Walsall police officer who was sacked for stealing cans of Carling has been jailed for heinous child sex offences.</p>
      <p>Ross O‘Grady originally pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sexual assault against three victims between during a two-year campaign of abuse from 2014 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old of High Street, Brownhills, later pleaded guilty to five offences during a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court and was sentenced to 13 years in prison and will be placed on the sex offender register for life on Wednesday, October 30.</p>

      <p>O’Grady was dismissed by the force on June 10, 2016, for gross misconduct relating to an unrelated theft matter.</p>
      <p>He claimed he had been suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and needed the cans of Carling for medicinal purposes because he saw “dead babies, murdered bodies and guns in his face” when he tried to sleep.</p>
      <p>But the sexual offences then came to light in 2017 when the victims courageously came forward to report the crimes.</p>
      <p>They also relived their trauma at court, so West Midlands Police could bring O’Grady to justice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The police investigation determined that some of these offences were carried out while he was a serving police officer.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Sam Kirk, from the public protection unit at West Midlands Police, said: "O’Grady’s behaviour was despicable. He held a position of trust and he abused this by committing these heinous crimes.</p>
      <p>“I commend the bravery of his victims, it has been an extremely traumatic time for them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“There is no place in society for this kind of behaviour and O’Grady must now serve time behind bars."</p>
