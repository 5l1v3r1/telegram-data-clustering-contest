      <h2>William Chase Hargrove allegedly murdered Russian fiancee Anna Repkina in Oregon, US, after his lover Michelle Chavez gave him an ultimatum</h2>

      <p>A KFC receipt found next to a murdered woman's body helped police track down her alleged killer, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>When Anna Repkina's corpse was found in a ditch in Oregon, US, investigators had no idea who she was.</p>
      <p>But a fast food bag close by contained a vital clue, and led police to uncover a "problematic love triangle" which they believe led to her death.</p>
      <p>Ms Repkina had reportedly been lured from Russia by William Chase Hargrove's promise to marry her - but his existing lover was furious as their relationship developed.</p>
      <p>After Michelle Chavez - who was herself in a loveless marriage - gave Hargrove an ultimatum, he murdered Ms Repkina "execution style", it is claimed.</p>

      <p>Police made the link when they questioned Hargrove's pal Kevin Thomas, whose name was on the fast food receipt.</p>
      <p>He had eaten the KFC meal with his friend, who told him about his troubled lovelife.</p>
      <p>Hargrove had recently asked Thomas if he could borrow a shotgun, <a href="https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/alsea-murder-trial-friend-recounts-loaning-gun-to-accused-killer/article_0848ad8d-966b-5a49-93ea-67a67b8ce5d3.html">the Gazette-Times</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Hargrove, 29, is now on trial accused of murdering the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that Ms Repkina was taken to a remote area by her killer and shot in the back of the head.</p>
      <p>At a 2017 hearing, prosecutor Amie Matusko said: “He took the victim out to a very remote logging location, “and she was found shot dead in the back of her head, execution style.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hargrove however claims he is innocent - accusing Ms Chavez of being the real killer.</p>
      <p>She denies any involvement in the murder.</p>
      <p>Bouncer Hargrove moved into a home owned by Chavez, who he started an open relationship - which her husband was aware of.</p>
      <p>At the same time he began chatting to Ms Repkina online, and she flew from Moscow to meet him in 2016.</p>
      <p>She made the move permanent the following year, the trial heard, and posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> that the pair were going to marry.</p>
      <p>But by that time Ms Chavez had vowed to leave her husband, and given Hargrove her wedding ring - which he then used to propose to his second lover.</p>
      <p>They were due to marry on March 2017, but did not go through with it.</p>
      <p>On April 16 that year, it is alleged, Hargrove used the shotgun he had borrowed from Thomas to murder Ms Repkina.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the killing, he met up with Ms Chavez for sex, prosecutors claim.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/04/william-chase-hargrove-anna-repkina-oregon-murder/">Washington Post</a> , defence attorney Mike Flinn said: “Mr. Hargrove has always maintained that he did not kill his fiancee.</p>
      <p>“The evidence at trial will clearly show that Michelle Chavez murdered Anna Repkina.”</p>
