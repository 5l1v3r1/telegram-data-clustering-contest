Brooklyn Nets fans attempted to rattle New Orleans Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram on Monday night during their matchup with chants about his former teammate.
During the matchup, fans were reportedly yelling “LeBron didn’t want you” while Ingram was shooting free throws. Ingram played with LeBron James last season before the Los Angeles Lakers traded him to the Pelicans in part of a package to land Anthony Davis.
According to The Athletic, Ingram hit both free throws and then followed up with a finger-roll layup. To make things more interesting, Ingram finished the game with a career-high 40 points on 17-of-24 shooting.
