      <p>BBC's psychological thriller <i>Dublin Murders </i>has been captivating viewers for the past few weeks, but tonight (Nov. 5) the eight-episode series will come to a close. Based on author Tana French's <i>Dublin Murder Squad </i>series, there are still four books for the show to cover. So <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-dublin-murders-book-ending-caused-a-huge-divide-in-the-literary-world-19212466">will <i>Dublin Murders </i>return for series 2?</a></p>
      <p>The psychological thriller combines the first two books from French's<i> </i>series, which contains a further four books that continue through the perspectives of different investigators. As BT TV notes, <a href="https://tv.bt.com/tv/tv-from-bt/dublin-murders-cast-characters-11364402553725">if a second series gets the go-ahead</a>, it's expected "to follow the style of the books with new lead characters taking over". As <i>Dublin Murders </i>combines <i>In The Woods </i>and <i>The Likeness, </i>this would lead to Detective Frank Mackey (played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor) taking the reigns as he does in French's third novel <i>Faithful Place</i>.</p>
      <p>Kate Harwood, executive producer of the series, also spoke about <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2019102279482/dublin-murders-episode-three-fans-confused-plot/">Frank's importance to the story</a> in an interview with <i>Hello! </i>Magazine. "Every book is narrated by a detective with a very intense connection to the crime," she explained. "There is also a secondary detective in each novel that goes on to lead in the subsequent book. It's as if a baton is passed from book to book." Harwood continued:</p>
      <blockquote>"The lead character Frank from the third book <i>Faithful Place </i>appears in <i>The Likeness </i>as Cassie's mentor and nemesis so, he is very strongly present in the latter half of the series too."</blockquote>

      <p>But as the BBC has yet to announce a renewal of <i>Dublin Murders</i>, it's return is a bit up in the air at the moment. A rep for the show tells Bustle that there's "[n]o news to report on a second series yet".</p>
      <p>Although, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/dublin-murders-star-killian-scott-up-for-season-two-despite-series-based-on-book-trilogy-10923367/"><i>Dublin Murders </i>cast seem very eager</a> about continuing the series. Killian Scott (Rob Reilly) recently told <i>Metro </i>that he'd totally be up for reprising his role. "I'd come back! When you're a working actor you see a lot of scripts all the time, but to get to do something that's really well written it's a rare privilege," he said. "Rob and Cassie are ridiculously well written roles. They're such rich characters."</p>
      <p><i>The finale of </i>Dublin Murders <i>airs Tuesday (Nov. 5) on BBC One at 9 p.m.</i></p>
