      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — The High Court today dismissed applications filed by five men, two of them state assemblymen, to be released immediately from detention over their alleged links to the LTTE group.</p>
      <p>Judicial commissioner Datuk Ahmad Shahrir Mohd Salleh said the habeas corpus applications have  become academic and irrelevant because the applicants have been charged in court.</p>
      <p>“Their detention expired once they were charged in court. As such, their applications are dismissed,” he said.</p>
      <p>The applicants are G. Saminathan, 34, and P. Gunasekaran, 60, who are the assemblymen for Gadek (Melaka) and Seremban Jaya (Negeri Sembilan) respectively; S. Chandru, 38, and V. Suresh Kumar, 43, who are DAP members; and technician S. Arivainathan, 56.</p>
      <p>They had named as respondents Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division (E8) principal assistant director Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay; Insp Jasveer Singh (who arrested them); Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador; the Home Ministry and the Government of Malaysia. — Bernama</p>
