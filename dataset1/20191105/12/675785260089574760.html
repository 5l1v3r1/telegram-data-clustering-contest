      <h1>Shoppers outraged over ‘rip-off’ £45 Cadbury Selection Box seen in Sainsbury's</h1>
      <h2>The deal shocked bargain loving Brits at first, but there might be an explanation for the high price tag that makes it a lot better value than it seemed originally</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:59:37+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Shocked shoppers discovered Sainsbury's selling a Cadbury's Selection Box for an astonishing £45.</p>
      <p>The deal was spotted by Shane Butler, who promptly posted it on the money-saving site <a href="https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/">Latest Deals</a> .</p>
      <p>His post got a lot of attention, with hundreds of people pointing out how much they could save buying the chocolate themselves.</p>
      <p>"It'd be cheaper to buy all the chocolates separately &amp; make the box yourself,” one wrote.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Could make it myself for £25 and even have chocolate left over to do a smaller one.”</p>
      <p>But the deal - at the same price as it is <a href="https://www.cadburygiftsdirect.co.uk/our-product-range/cadbury-ultimate-selection-box.html">on the Cadbury's website</a> - might be a bit better than it first looks.</p>

      <p>"Probably the World's biggest selection box, the Cadbury Ultimate Selection Box is ideal for sharing, containing 26 chocolate bars and weighing over 2 kilos," Cadbury's description reads. "Best of luck fitting this under the tree...."</p>
      <p>However, there's something not mentioned on the list that eagle-eyed shoppers pointed out might make it rather good value after all.</p>
      <p>"It could be because there is 2 Cadburys World tickets inside and think they retail at £12.85 each,” one person pointed out.</p>
      <p>Including those, the price drops to a far more reasonable £19.30 - making it cheaper than buying the chocolate yourself.</p>
