NARCO-TERROR: 9 U.S. Women, Children Murdered by Cartel Gunmen near New Mexico Border
A group of cartel gunmen ambushed and murdered three women and six children near a rural Mormon community in Mexico, close to the New Mexico border. Six more children, all from the same family, were also injured. One additional girl remains missing. Relatives stated that all of the victims are dual U.S. and Mexican citizens.

The attack took place on Monday when three women from the Lebaron family were driving their 14 children from the town of Bavispe, Sonora, to a rural Mormon community called La Mora. According to Mexico’s SinEmbargo.com.mx, Rhonita Miller Lebaron was driving one of the vehicles with her four children–two six-month-old twins and two ages 8 and 9–when her SUV got a flat tire. Her relatives turned back towards Bavispe to bring a spare.



When the relatives returned, they found large plumes of smoke coming from the roadside scene. The relatives found a charred SUV with their loved inside the vehicle. Soon after, a group of cartel gunmen attacked and forced them to run into the brush for cover.



The two other women and their children were struck numerous times by gunfire. Six of the children ran into the brush and survived, but one young girl is still missing. In the aftermath, cartel gunmen sealed the area for hours to keep news of the massacre from spreading. Lebaron family members in the U.S. took to social media to raise awareness about the murders.





UPDATE


Initial reports from the family said 12 members were killed. Over night, the number of dead adjusted to 10. Alfonso Durazo, Mexico’s Public Security Secretary, announced Tuesday morning that the death toll stands at three women and six children. Another six children were injured and one more remains missing as of Tuesday morning.
