標普500頻創新高 高盛：美股仍是首選

05 Nov 2019, 12:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】儘管標普500指數近日連創歷史新高，週一（4日）續漲0.37%至3,078點，但管理5,000億美元資產的高盛私人財富管理公司卻持續看好美股年底前的漲勢，認為美股仍是投資的首選。
彭博社報導，該資產管理公司的執行董事艾爾達格納（Silvia Ardagna）表示，他們仍然押注高於權重（overweight）的比例在美股，認為美股相對其它資產擁有絕對優勢。
根據高盛內部的評估，德國經濟已陷入技術性衰退，英國也有脫歐的問題，而美國經濟中期仍然相對其它國家表現亮麗，由於10月強勁的非農就業報告更凸顯美國經濟的韌性，更證實了美聯儲釋出暫停降息訊號的正確性。
此外，從過去10年的經驗也顯示，美股的表現已擊敗其它的市場，而且也擊敗債市。因此，高盛認為此時加碼美股投資是正確的決策。
就美中貿易談判目前的正面發展而言，高盛也認為有助於資金持續流向股市，據統計在截至10月30日為止的一週內，有61億美元的資金流入全球股票基金，扭轉了今年以來美股基金被淨贖回580億美元的劣勢。
艾爾達格納認為，美中貿易緊張關係的降溫，凸顯投資人過去一段時間過於保守的事實，一旦事件朝向正面發展，或有意想不到的意外驚喜。尤其美國經濟數據漸入佳境，製造業也開始穩定，服務業則持續堅挺，這將有助於美股大幅上漲。
在美中雙方釋出貿易協議的正面訊息後，摩根大通也在週一的報告中維持其看漲美股的建議，並預測如果貿易不確定性降溫和採購經理人指數觸底，美股將有更大的上漲空間。
或許受到去年第四季標普指數一度重挫20%的心理陰霾影響，華爾街分析師年初對今年整年的行情並沒有特別樂觀。據CNBC追蹤17位知名策略師對標普指數今年底的預測數字後，發現僅3位策略師的目標價高於週一的收盤價，顯示多數專家都低估了美股今年上漲的潛力。
這17位策略師年初預測標普500指數今年底的平均目標價為3,000點，低於週一的收盤價2.7%。最悲觀的是瑞銀預測的2,550點，比週一的收盤價少了17%，就連摩根士丹利也悲觀預測標普指數只能停留在2,750點。顯示這些專家們年初高估了貿易戰、經濟衰退風險等諸多因素的衝擊。
週一道指也跟進刷新歷史高價，今年漲幅達18%，羅素2000指數也上漲約18%，標普指數則上漲23%。據此，許多分析師近期已陸續上調標普指數年底目標價至3,200點以上，該價位已高於年初最樂觀的華爾街投行Piper Jaffray所預測的3,125點。
儘管如此，仍有分析師認為應該居高思危。被譽為華爾街多頭司令的研究機構Yardeni Research的總裁亞德尼（Edward Yardeni）警告，如果標普500指數的前瞻本益比由目前的17倍漲到19～20倍，脫離歷史常態區域15～16倍，股市可能引爆一波「令人討厭的修正」（nasty correction）。
他認為，如果標普500指數漲到3,500點（距週一收盤約有13%漲幅），屆時估值將過分高估，他會建議投資人部分持股獲利了結。
他同時警告，美股明年最大的風險是川普連任失敗，他主張如果民主黨主政，美股將落入熊市，美國經濟也將進入衰退。

S&P 500 frequency innovation high Goldman Sachs: US stocks are still the first choice

05 Nov 2019, 12:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Although the S&P 500 index hit a record high in recent days, it rose 0.37% to 3,078 points on Monday (4th), but Goldman Sachs private wealth management company, which manages $500 billion in assets, Continue to be optimistic about the gains of US stocks before the end of the year, and believe that US stocks are still the first choice for investment.
Bloomberg reported that Silvia Ardagna, executive director of the asset management company, said that they still bet on the overweight ratio in the US stocks, believing that US stocks have an absolute advantage over other assets.
According to the internal assessment of Goldman Sachs, the German economy has fallen into a technical recession, and the UK also has problems with Brexit. The US economy is still performing relatively well in other countries, as the strong non-farm payrolls report in October highlights the resilience of the US economy. The Fed released the correctness of the suspension of interest rate cuts.
In addition, experience from the past 10 years also shows that the performance of US stocks has beaten other markets and also beat the bond market. Therefore, Goldman Sachs believes that adding US stock investment at this time is the right decision.
In terms of the current positive development of the US-China trade negotiations, Goldman Sachs also believes that it will help the funds continue to flow to the stock market. According to statistics, within the week ending October 30, $6.1 billion of funds flowed into global equity funds, reversing this year. Since then, the US stock fund has been netted back to a disadvantage of $58 billion.
El Dagner believes that the cooling of the US-China trade tension highlights the fact that investors have been too conservative in the past, once the event is heading towards positive development or unexpected surprises. In particular, the US economic data is getting better and better, the manufacturing industry is also starting to stabilize, and the service industry is continuing to be strong, which will help the US stocks rise sharply.
After the US and China released a positive message from the trade agreement, JPMorgan also maintained its recommendation to bullish US stocks in its report on Monday, and predicted that if trade uncertainty cools and the purchasing managers' index bottoms out, US stocks will have greater The upside.
Perhaps due to the psychological haze that the S&P index once plunged 20% in the fourth quarter of last year, Wall Street analysts were not particularly optimistic about the market this year. According to CNBC's tracking of the forecast of the S&P index by 17 well-known strategists at the end of this year, it was found that the target price of only three strategists was higher than the closing price on Monday, indicating that most experts underestimated the potential for US stocks to rise this year.
The 17 strategists predicted at the beginning of the year that the S&P 500 had an average target price of 3,000 points at the end of the year, down from 2.7% on Monday's closing price. The most pessimistic is UBS's forecast of 2,550 points, which is 17% lower than Monday's closing price. Even Morgan Stanley is pessimistic about predicting that the S&P index can only stay at 2,750 points. It shows that these experts overestimated the impact of trade wars, economic recession risks and other factors at the beginning of the year.
Zhou Zhizhi also followed up with a record high price, this year's increase of 18%, Russell 2000 index also rose about 18%, the S&P index rose by 23%. Accordingly, many analysts have recently raised the target price of the S&P index to over 3,200 points, which is higher than the 3,125 points predicted by Piper Jaffray, the most optimistic Wall Street investment bank at the beginning of the year.
Despite this, there are still analysts who believe that they should be at risk. Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, a research firm known as Wall Street's long commander, warned that if the S&P 500's forward-looking P/E ratio rises from the current 17-fold to 19-20 times, it is out of the historical normal area 15~ 16 times, the stock market may ignite a wave of ""nasty correction.""
He believes that if the S&P 500 rises to 3,500 points (about 13% from Monday's close), the valuation will be overvalued and he will recommend investors to take some of the shares.
He also warned that the biggest risk for US stocks next year is the failure of Trump's re-election. He argues that if the Democratic Party is in power, US stocks will fall into a bear market, and the US economy will also enter a recession.
