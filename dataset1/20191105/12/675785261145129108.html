      <p>Gary Lineker was moved to tears as he saw where his grandad treated wounded comrades beside a river flowing red with blood during a Second World War battle.</p>
      <p>The BBC presenter, 58, went to Italy to explore Stanley Ebbs’ role in a campaign that included the 1944 Battle of Monte Cassino for a TV documentary.</p>
      <p>Gary knew his grandad served in Italy with the Royal Army Medical Corps but reveals that Stanley never spoke to him about his experiences.</p>
      <p>He said: “My grandad was one of the first people to get on the (Cassino) beach when they landed. He helped set up the camps and the medical aid sites.</p>

      <p>“To discover how treacherous even the landing was – being shot, very similar to what it was like landing on the beaches in Normandy...everything that I discovered was educating and also sometimes very upsetting.”</p>
      <p>Using Stanley’s unit’s war diary as a guide, Gary follows the campaign from the first landings at Salerno.</p>

      <p>As Gary learns how relentless the fighting was, he comes to understand why his grandfather never shared the harrowing memories.</p>

      <p>Asked what made him tearful, Gary said: “We were filming about how they had to get across one of the rivers. I could work out exactly where my grandfather would have been in the ambulance medical aid tent, and that a few yards from where I was stood, absolutely harrowing scenes would have been happening. The river was literally running red with blood. Knowing that my grandad would have been just a few yards away really got me.”</p>
      <p>He said he wanted Allied fighters in Italy to be recognised for taking Rome from the Nazis, a triumph overshadowed by D-Day the next day.</p>
      <p>Gary added: “The campaign was incredibly grim. So many people lost their lives.”</p>
