      <h1>Kieran Tierney's Scotland absence explained by Steve Clarke as Arsenal star misses out again</h1>
      <h2>The left-back has made a phased return to action after a sustained injury lay-off.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:28:38+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke has revealed Arsenal requested <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> again be left out of the Scotland squad – despite now being a regular in Unai Emery’s side.</p>
      <p>The former Celtic left-back is not among the 25-man contingent selected to face Cyprus and Kazakhstan in Euro 2020 qualifying, having sat out during the last international break.</p>
      <p>Tierney is recovering from a long-term pelvic issue and also underwent surgery on a double hernia before making a £25million move to London during the summer.</p>
      <p>His return is being carefully managed by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>, although he has now made six appearances totalling 426 minutes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Clarke</a> admits the 22-year-old's continued absence is frustrating but insists he has plenty of depth in the shape of Andy Robertson and Greg Taylor.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> boss said: "There's an ongoing issue. Arsenal asked us not to select him. It’s a bit frustrating but we have good cover in that position."</p>
      <p>Clarke welcomed Steven Naismith back into the fold after he returned to the pitch for Hearts at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The striker is another whose season has been plagued by injury but Clarke is convinced he's fit enough to make an impact.</p>
      <p>Clarke added: "He hasn’t played much but I spoke to him yesterday and his fitness is good. He expects to start the next game and he’ll be a good addition to the squad."</p>
      <p>Also returning are Ryan Jack, Oli McBurnie and Liam Cooper after injury ruled them out of clashes with Russia, Belgium and San Marino.</p>
