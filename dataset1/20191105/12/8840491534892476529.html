      <p>A FORMER convent site in Mayo is to be revitalised.</p>
      <p>Mayo County Council has unveiled plans for a library and civic offices in the grounds of a former convent in Westport.</p>
      <p>Government funding has been in place for the project for over four years.</p>
      <p>A public consultation process is underway and will remain open until December 10.</p>
      <p>Local Councillor Peter Flynn said the site is a very historic one and central to the town's heritage.</p>
      <p>He welcomed the plans, adding they may involve a public/private partnership to bring the project to fruition.</p>
      <p>A number of local people have called for a memorial to be erected on a part of the site where an orphanage and industrial school once existed.</p>
