Shoppers outraged over ‘rip-off’ £45 Cadbury Selection Box seen in Sainsbury's
The deal shocked bargain loving Brits at first, but there might be an explanation for the high price tag that makes it a lot better value than it seemed originally

Shocked shoppers discovered Sainsbury's selling a Cadbury's Selection Box for an astonishing £45.
The deal was spotted by Shane Butler, who promptly posted it on the money-saving site Latest Deals .
His post got a lot of attention, with hundreds of people pointing out how much they could save buying the chocolate themselves.
""It'd be cheaper to buy all the chocolates separately & make the box yourself,” one wrote.
Another said: ""Could make it myself for £25 and even have chocolate left over to do a smaller one.”
But the deal - at the same price as it is on the Cadbury's website - might be a bit better than it first looks.

The limited edition box measures a massive 75cm x 48 cm x 4cm, and weighs in at 2.1kg and includes 26 chocolate bars.
Inside you find:

Cadbury Dairy Milk 360g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Crunchie 200g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Tiffin 200g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Daim 120g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut 110g
Dairy Milk Oreo Bar 120g
Dairy Milk Mint Oreo 120g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Whole Nut 120g
Cadbury Dairy Milk 45g
Cadbury Dairy Milk with Caramel 120g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut 49g
Cadbury Dairy Milk Whole Nut 45g
Crunchie 40g

Cadbury Freddo 18g

Cadbury Fudge 25g
Cadbury Chomp 23.5g

""Probably the World's biggest selection box, the Cadbury Ultimate Selection Box is ideal for sharing, containing 26 chocolate bars and weighing over 2 kilos,"" Cadbury's description reads. ""Best of luck fitting this under the tree....""
However, there's something not mentioned on the list that eagle-eyed shoppers pointed out might make it rather good value after all.
""It could be because there is 2 Cadburys World tickets inside and think they retail at £12.85 each,” one person pointed out.
Including those, the price drops to a far more reasonable £19.30 - making it cheaper than buying the chocolate yourself.
