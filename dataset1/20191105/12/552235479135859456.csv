The SNP have vowed to work towards tackling inequality in Monklands and “lift people out of poverty” with new commitments to expand childcare into primary school and scrap social care charges.
As announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the party will scrap all non-residential social care charges and expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds if re-elected at the 2021 election.
The development has been hailed by Airdrie MSP Alex Neil, who said: “By August next year the SNP in government will have all but doubled the hours children receive.
“It will give them 30 hours a week of high quality, free care and education – saving families in my Airdrie & Shotts constituency £4500 per year for each child.

“But we will not stop there. If the SNP is elected after the next Holyrood election, we will expand childcare into the school holidays for primary pupils from the poorest backgrounds – to help ensure that parents can continue working over holiday periods.
“Earlier this year, the Scottish Government extended free personal care to everyone who needs it, regardless of age – and over the next parliament, the SNP will scrap non-residential social care charges for all.
“We are determined to help families with the cost of living throughout their lifetimes – ensuring that fairness and equality are embedded in our society.”
