      <p>President Uhuru Kenyatta has appealed to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and local investigation agencies to consider negotiation as a tool to resolve minor tax evasion cases.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Tuesday at Safari Park in Nairobi during this year’s taxpayers awards, the president stated that KRA should not be weaponised to fight local entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>He called on the Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti and the Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji not to criminalise every tax evasion cases. The two were in attendance.</p>
      <p>“KRA should come up with other ways of dealing with minor cases on tax evasion to avoid delays, ” the President said.</p>
      <p>“I direct Treasury, KRA, office of the AG to make recommendations that will strengthen the tax enforcement legal framework. KRA must have power to address tax evasion, expedite dispute resolution process.”</p>

      <p>He called upon the judiciary to expeditiously determine tax disputes further directing the Tax Appeals Tribunal to table a report within the next three months on the progress of the cases.</p>
      <p>In the thinly veiled message, the Head of State seemed to address recent cases that saw several renowned business people arrested over tax evasion cases amounting to billions of shillings.</p>
      <p>In August, owners of Keroche Breweries Tabitha Karanja and her husband Joseph Karanja were charged with several counts of tax evasion.</p>
      <p>The duo’s arrest was ordered by the DPP over tax fraud that was allegedly committed between January 2015 and June 2019.</p>

      <p>While Ms Karanja spent the night at the DCI headquarters, her husband was released last night following a warning from Karen Hospital who noted that the director had just undergone a surgery and he needs medical attention.</p>
      <p>The Karanjas are facing charges of tax evasion amounting to Ksh14.4 billion, which was subject to a consensus between Keroche and the taxman.</p>
      <p>Ms Karanja termed the tax evasion claims malicious further accusing the government led by the DPP of frustrating local entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>“We are deeply shocked by both the allegations and the manner in which the matter has been handled. My shock is how a local investor can be humiliated, embarrassed and denied well-deserved respect,” said Mrs Karanja.</p>

      <p>She revealed that the matter involved company’s Viena Ice ready to drink vodka introduced in the market in July 2007, which is a matter that is ongoing at the tax appeals tribunal.</p>
      <p>” It’s a surprise Mr Noordin Haji claiming that Keroche Breweries is involved with a tax fraud amounting to a colossal Ksh14 billion; a figure that is baseless and without facts. The DPPs office must not be misled and needs get his facts right about this matter. The deployment of unnecessary force, communicating to a corporate entity through social media, and the deliberate publishing of false information to defame and destroy the reputation of a Kenyan company reeks of sabotage and not due process. Having a dispute with KRA does not constitute a criminal offence,” she said.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2009 and wholly owned by the Karanja family, Keroche started by making spirits and wines before diversifying into beer. It was the first-ever Kenyan-owned company to brew beer which for a long time was the preserve of East African Breweries Limited (EABL).</p>

      <p>In the same month, Thika billionaire Humphrey Kariuki was also charged over Ksh41 billion tax evasion offence by Africa Spirits and Wow Beverages.</p>
      <p>The DPP was overly criticized over the arrests and humiliation of the entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>“Whereas tax evasion is serious crime&amp;considering our economic situation&amp;high rate of unemployment I urge KRA to negotiate repayment plan 4 evaded taxes with Keroche&amp;HumphreyKariuki instead of criminal enforcement. This fight must not leave the country in a worse situation than it is, ” said Majority leader in the Senate Kipchumba Murkomen.</p>
