      <p><b>BEIJING</b> — President Xi Jinping has promised more steps to gradually open Chinese markets to foreign investment but offered no new initiatives to ease trade tension with Washington and Europe.</p>
      <p>Xi spoke Tuesday at the opening of the second China International Import Expo. The fair is meant to mollify Beijing’s trading partners by showcasing its vast and growing import market.</p>
      <p>In a speech, Xi promised to “expand market opening” and move ahead with promises to reduce restrictions on foreign investment.</p>
      <p>Beijing has cut tariffs and eased other import restrictions but none of the steps directly addresses the complaints by the US, Europe, and others about restrictions on foreign companies.</p>
      <p>Business groups have welcomed greater access to Chinese consumers but are frustrated at Beijing’s gradual pace and restrictions still in place on services and other industries.</p>
