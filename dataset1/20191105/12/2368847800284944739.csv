F1美國站：漢密爾頓提前兩站奪車手總冠軍

05 Nov 2019, 12:30

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】當地時間11月3日，2019賽季F1第19站——美國站，梅賽德斯車隊再次包攬冠亞軍，杆位起步的博塔斯（Valtteri Bottas）在倒數第四圈超越隊友漢密爾頓（Lewis Hamilton）率先衝線，首次登上美國站的最高頒獎台。採取一停策略的小漢屈居亞軍，就此鎖定年度車手總冠軍，這是他繼2008年、2014年、2015年、2017年和2018年後，第六度加冕年度車手總冠軍，其中最近五冠都是以梅賽德斯車手身分獲得。
紅牛車隊的荷蘭籍車手維斯塔潘（Max Verstappen）位居第三名，法拉利車隊摩納哥車手勒克萊爾（Charles Leclerc）獲得第四名的同時，還拿到了最快單圈的額外一分獎勵，他的隊友德國名將維特爾（Sebastian Vettel）開賽不久遭遇懸掛故障退賽。

在前一天的排位賽上，梅賽德斯車隊車手博塔斯摘下杆位，打破了法拉利車隊過去六連杆的強勁勢頭，維特爾、維斯塔潘、勒克萊爾和漢密爾頓分別排在第二至第五。漢密爾頓在本站比賽只需要拿到4個積分，就可以提前兩站問鼎2019賽季車手年度總冠軍，這也將追近德國車王舒馬赫「七冠王」紀錄。
比賽開始後的第一個彎角，博塔斯穩穩搶到一號彎內線，維斯塔潘則在第一彎超掉維特爾上升到第二。幾個彎角過後，發車節奏相當差的維特爾，接連被漢密爾頓和勒克萊爾超越。比賽行進至第8圈，維特爾的賽車懸掛直接斷裂，賽車後胎爆胎，賽車也停靠在賽道邊，法拉利車手無奈退賽。
第15圈，排在前面的博塔斯選擇進站，出站之後力壓維斯塔潘上升至第三，並在一圈之後輕鬆超越勒克萊爾，排名再次回到第二，僅落後隊友小漢。隨後，輪胎更新的維斯塔潘也超越勒克萊爾，法拉利陷入苦戰。然而更糟的是，第21圈勒克萊爾進站時卻遭遇噩夢，法拉利的右後胎更換出現問題，停站耗時7.7秒之多，回到賽道之後，勒克萊爾的排名也掉到第5位。
第24圈，梅賽德斯讓漢密爾頓進站，但車手本人要求再跑長一些，隨後在賽道上被隊友博塔斯輕鬆過掉。漢密爾頓隨即進站換上硬胎，以完成自己的一停策略。回歸賽道之後，小漢也馬上刷新了最快單圈。
第35圈，小維斯塔潘進站換上黃色中性胎，完成二停。隨後一圈，博塔斯也完成進站。之後，勒克萊爾也完成二停，不過法拉利為其換上的是軟胎，意圖是刷極速圈去爭額外的一個積分獎勵。
第45圈，勒克萊爾利用輕油和輪胎優勢刷出1分36秒169的最快單圈成績。第52圈，之前已經發起攻勢但被漢密爾頓強硬擠出賽道的博塔斯，利用輪胎和DRS優勢，成功超車拿回領跑位置。而維斯塔潘也開始發力，向漢密爾頓發起攻擊。
最後兩圈，維斯塔潘距離漢密爾頓只有1.3秒，最後一圈，距離仍有1秒。哈斯車隊的馬格努森在最後一圈滑出賽道，停在沙石區，賽會也在第二賽段出示黃旗，這也側面幫助漢密爾頓守住了亞軍的位置。
最終，博塔斯率先衝線，奪得美國站冠軍，漢密爾頓獲得亞軍。憑藉本場比賽的亞軍，漢密爾頓加冕了個人第六座車手總冠軍，僅次於「七冠王」邁克爾‧舒馬赫，獨居第二位。

在達成「六冠王」偉業之後，漢密爾頓表示：「我現在的情緒很難用言語來表達。這是真正的幸福！我要真心感謝工廠裡的每一個人，以及今年在車隊裡為我提供支持的每一個人，他們的努力工作，讓我們能夠取得這些成績。」
漢密爾頓與梅賽德斯車隊的合約將在下賽季結束後到期。2021年，F1將進入新規則時代。目前小漢已經獲得過83次分站冠軍，距離舒馬赫保持的91個歷史最佳紀錄，僅剩8個。對英國人來講，成為F1史上最偉大車手這個目標，已經不再遙遠。
