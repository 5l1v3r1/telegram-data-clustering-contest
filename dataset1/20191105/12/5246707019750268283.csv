05 Nov 2019, 12:30 by Ryan Craddock



If you're still on the lookout for Luigi's Mansion 3 and happen to be in the market for a Nintendo Switch to play it on, these new deals could be just the ticket.
Black Friday is still a few weeks away, but Amazon UK appears to be getting in on the deals early with this selection of Nintendo Switch offers. At the time of writing, you can grab any Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Lite and effectively get a copy of Luigi's Mansion 3 for just £20 or £30 respectively (the two consoles sell for £279.99 and £199.99 on their own).
Here are the deals in question (which are only available for a limited time):
