      <p>The work - known variously as the Graffiti Painter, The Painter or Velazquez - shows an artist, thought to be Spanish painter Diego Velazquez, with an easel writing “Banksy” in large red letters.</p>
      <p>Drawn on the corner of Acklam and Portbello Road in 2008, it was covered after developer Enstar Capital began refurbishing the property to make luxury flats.</p>
      <p>“It is a lovely feature for the building and a lovely feature in Notting Hill which has retained its Londonness,” Enstar Capital Chief Executive Simon Lyons told Reuters.</p>
      <p>“One of the reasons I bought the building was that there was a Banksy there - it gave it that iconic profile. So while I think the prices for Banksy are nonsensical, you could say I was a fan in some ways.”</p>
      <p>Enstar originally wanted to move the Banksy but decided it would have been too risky so it remains in the same place and is covered by glass and is floodlit.</p>
      <p>Luxury flats at the property are worth at least 950,000 pounds ($1.2 million) for a one-bedroom, Lyons said.</p>
      <p>“Would I love it if Banksy came and did it on the building where I live? Probably not,” Lyons said.</p>
