      <h1>Malaysia OKs Gojek's entry, ride-hailing firm says talks still on</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:10:38+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>KUALA LUMPUR/JAKARTA (Nov 5): Malaysia will allow motorcycle-hailing firms such as Indonesia's Gojek to start limited operations from January, a minister said on Tuesday, which could help end Grab's near-monopoly in Malaysia's broader ride-hailing market.</p>
      <p>Gojek — whose investors include Alphabet's Google and Chinese tech companies Tencent and JD.com — told <i>Reuters </i>it has yet to decide how or when it will enter the Malaysian market, pending clarity on the regulatory framework being drafted by the country's transport ministry.</p>
      <p>"We will now reach out to the ministry to understand the framework and to work through the detail of how we might approach a launch (in) Malaysia," a Gojek spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately, we want to support governments as they develop the digital economy in ways that are inclusive, foster innovation and drive competition."</p>
      <p>Malaysia's ride-hailing segment is expected to earn revenue of US$558 million this year, growing at about 16% annually to hit US$1 billion by 2023, according to German database company Statista.</p>
      <p>At 12.7%, ride-hailing user-penetration in Malaysia, Southeast Asia's third-biggest economy with 32 million people, is nearly double that of the region overall.</p>
      <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke Siew Fook told parliament firms such as Gojek and local start-up Dego Ride would be able to start operating based on a proof-of-concept basis, to measure demand for the service over six months.</p>
      <p>"Bike-hailing will be an important component in providing a comprehensive public transport system, as a mode for first- and last-mile connectivity," Loke said.</p>
      <p>The pilot project would be initially limited to the Klang Valley, Malaysia's most developed region and where the capital Kuala Lumpur is located.</p>
      <p>The six-month programme would allow the government and participating firms to gather data and evaluate demand, while the government worked on drafting legislation to govern bike-hailing.</p>
      <p>"Bike-hailing will be subject to similar regulations as laid out for e-hailing," the minister said, referring to existing ride-hailing operations by companies such as Grab.</p>
      <p>Gojek's co-chief executive, Andre Soelistyo, told reporters on Saturday that the company was preparing expansion into Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Gojek's Malaysia entry would likely pose the biggest challenge to Grab, which dominates its e-hailing market, after it bought Uber Technology Inc's operations in Southeast Asia last year.</p>
      <p>Malaysia last month proposed a US$20.5 million fine for Grab, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank, for allegedly violating competition law by imposing restrictive clauses on its drivers.</p>
      <p>"Bring it on!" Grab Malaysia said on Twitter after Loke's announcement.</p>
      <p>"It is indeed healthy competition."</p>
