      <p>A man faces court today after being arrested on suspicion of setting light to a Mount Gould property with intent to endanger lives.</p>
      <p>John Dangerfield, age 49, is set to appear at Plymouth Magistrates' Court today following his arrest on November 4.</p>
      <p>He was arrested after firefighters were called to a suspicious fire at a property in Ladysmith Road at around 8.10am.</p>
      <p>The road was closed to traffic for more than an hour as the emergency services carried out their work. Neighbouring properties were not affected or evacuated.</p>
      <p>The fire is understood to have taken hold in the front room of the address. No-one was found inside the property and fire investigators, along with scene of crime officers, remained at the scene to establish the cause of the fire.</p>
