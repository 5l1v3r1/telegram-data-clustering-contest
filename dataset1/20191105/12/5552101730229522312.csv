05 Nov 2019, 12:36 by 梁欣喬, 陳仁萱
公視人生劇展《畸零地》今（5）日舉行記者會，《畸零地》邀來實力與顏值兼具的年輕演員宋柏緯與劉倩妏主演，搭檔金鐘常客黃采儀、舞台劇演員陳彥壯（壯壯）等。製作人李永忻形容「就當作是先交個期中報告」，導演張翰則說「讓劇情比較容易接受，但又藏了想說的事」。
宋柏緯在片中飾演聒噪的代書，生動的演技還令張翰大讚「讓人想看他直演下去」，還表示「對柏緯我很驚奇，他常會演到讓我忘記喊卡或不想喊卡」。對於導演是演員出身，宋柏緯說「導演很清楚他要的是什麼，也信任我們，表演空間滿大的」。








劇中滿滿對話戲，宋柏緯坦言壓力頗大，連張翰都說「他得去自我推銷，說自己有多會」；後來排戲後看見宋柏緯的準備功夫，張翰坦言「比較安心，他可以做快速的對話」；但上戲前一天宋還是失眠，也表示「拍這齣戲練到滿多的口條與記憶力」，也說「與私底下的我不太一樣」，連劉倩妏也說「一開始有主動找話題聊，但他真的話少，後來發現這樣會他可能想專注在自己角色裡，最後就陪他一起安靜」。
劉倩妏出身馬來西亞，張翰嘖嘖稱奇說「她華語全無口音，差點以為她是台灣演員」；片中她繼承母親的畸零地，多場思親的戲令觀者動容，劇組形容「她眼睛好像永遠在說著故事」。也對第一次合作的張翰讚譽有加「演員出身的導演也很懂得如此跟演員溝通，可以很精準地把演員帶到對的點上」。。《畸零地》將於本周日（11/10）晚間10 時、公視首播。
