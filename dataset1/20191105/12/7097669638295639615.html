      <h1>Gunmen slaughter nine members of US Mormon family in Mexico, including six children and three women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:24:42+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Chiara Giordano</a></address>
      <p>Gunmen murdered at least nine members of a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mormons">Mormon</a> family, including six children, after ambushing their cars in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mexico">Mexico</a>.</p>
      <p>Three US mothers, twin babies and four other minors were killed as they travelled along a dirt road in Bavispe, Sonora, on their way to Chihuahua.</p>
      <p>One of the women, Rhonita, was killed along with an 11-year-old boy, nine-year-old girl and twins less than a year old when her car broke down, relative Julian LeBaron told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/americas/mormons-mexico-attack.html"><i>New York Times</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Two other women, a four-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl were also killed when two other cars were attacked further ahead, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Seven other children survived by hiding by the roadside.</p>
      <p>A video posted on social media showed the charred and smoking remains of a burnt-out vehicle with bullet holes in it that was apparently carrying the victims when they were attacked on Monday.</p>
      <p>The group belonged to the LeBaron family - a breakaway Mormon community that settled in the hills and plains of northern Mexico decades ago.</p>
      <p>Relatives Alex and Julian LeBaron said nine people had died, although a government source only confirmed five.</p>
      <p>In the video, a male voice with an American accent can be heard off camera saying: “This is for the record. Nita and four of my grandchildren are burnt and shot up.”</p>
      <p>It is unclear what motivated the killings, however Mexico has been hit by a wave of attacks in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The most notable incident was a military-style <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drug-cartel">drug cartel</a> assault that forced the government to release a leader of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sinaloa-cartel">Sinaloa Cartel</a> in October.</p>
      <p>Given the fact US citizens were killed on Monday, the incident may increase pressure from Washington on president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to rein in armed groups.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate indication of who was behind the attack.</p>
      <p>Chihuahua and Sonora state governments issued a joint statement saying an investigation had been launched and that some people were presumed dead and others missing.</p>
      <p>Julian LeBaron described the incident as a “massacre”, saying some family members were burnt alive.</p>
      <p>In a text message, he said other injured members of the family were being transported to Phoenix, Arizona, for treatment.</p>
      <p>He said four boys, two girls and three women were killed.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know why, though they had received indirect threats. We don’t know who did it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Several children who fled the attack were lost for hours in the countryside before being found, Mr LeBaron added.</p>
      <p>In 2010, two members of the Chihuahua Mormon community, including one from the LeBaron family, were killed in apparent revenge after security forces tracked drug gang members.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mormons">Mormons</a> had suffered widespread kidnappings before that.</p>
      <p>Mormons of Germanic origin settled in northern Mexico in the 1920s from the US.</p>
      <p>The group broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church when it abandoned polygamous marriages.</p>
