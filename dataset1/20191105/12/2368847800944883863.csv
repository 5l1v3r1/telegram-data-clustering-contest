英超第11輪：利物浦絕殺追平歷史最佳開局

05 Nov 2019, 12:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】上週末，2019/20賽季英超聯賽進行了第11輪較量。利物浦在一球落後局面下，最後時刻連追兩球，以2：1逆轉阿斯頓維拉，繼續以6分優勢領跑。曼城和切爾西分別戰勝了各自的對手；阿森納和熱刺則皆以1：1被對手逼平；「六強」中只有曼聯在客場落敗；而「黑馬」萊斯特城客場2：0擊敗水晶宮後，繼續佔據聯賽第三的位置。
利物浦第94分鐘逆轉絕殺「領頭羊」利物浦本輪做客挑戰維拉。維拉深知兩隊實力相差懸殊，所以主打防守，用重兵來抑制「紅軍」的進攻。他們給利物浦前場的「三叉戟」製造了不小的麻煩，而主隊的反擊則踢得非常犀利。
第20分鐘，維拉獲得前場定位球的機會。利物浦防守造越位出現失敗，特雷澤蓋助主隊1：0先下一城。這讓主場的球迷陷入了瘋狂。此後，菲爾米諾曾打入一球，但被VAR認定，他越位在先，進球無效。
下半場，利物浦的進攻明顯加強，占據了場上的絕對優勢；維拉則安心打防守反擊，不過場上比分一直沒有改變。比賽最後時刻，利物浦幾乎形成了對維拉的半場圍攻。
第86分鐘，馬內突破後將球傳至門前，羅伯遜頭球破門，將比分1：1扳平。全場比賽傷停補時最後階段——第94分鐘，利物浦再度獲得機會。阿諾德開角球到禁區，馬內高高躍起，甩頭攻門得手，助利物浦2：1完成了反超絕殺。
全取3分後，利物浦追平了英超歷史上11輪過後的最佳開局。這也是英超史上第四次出現前11輪戰罷取得10勝1平這樣的佳績，之前三次分別是由2005/06賽季切爾西、2011/12賽季曼城和2017/19賽季曼城取得的。
同時，利物浦還將英超最長不敗紀錄延續至28場，成績為23勝5平。過去50場聯賽，利物浦僅輸了一場，那就是今年1月4日，在客場1：2負於曼城。
11月11日——英超下一輪，利物浦將在安菲爾德球場，迎戰衛冕冠軍曼城，目前兩隊相差6分，「紅軍」若能拿下「藍月亮」，領先優勢將擴大至9分，那基本上就意味著本賽季英超冠軍爭奪提前結束；若曼城在客場擊敗利物浦，那麼英超冠軍懸念將會繼續保留。
「黑馬」再現英超 穩居前四「黑馬」萊斯特城本輪繼續贏球，在客場以2：0戰勝了排名第9位、比曼聯和熱刺還靠前的水晶宮。這是萊斯特城本賽季的第7場勝利，目前積23分，憑藉淨勝球優勢，力壓切爾西，佔據積分榜的第三位，僅次於利物浦和曼城。
7勝2平2負這樣的成績，比他們4年前奪冠那個賽季的同期，還高1分；當時11輪比賽過後，曼城和阿森納都排在萊斯特城前面。如今，萊斯特城又是只落後2支球隊，分別落後利物浦8分、曼城2分。

從球隊的數據上看，萊斯特城的「黑馬」成色十足。11輪比賽，萊斯特城打入27球，整個英超，只有曼城的進球數超過他們；此外，他們的防守也非常不錯，一共只丟掉8球，與謝菲爾德聯一樣是目前英超丟球最少的球隊，而利物浦已丟掉9球，曼城丟掉了10球。
從目前來看，萊斯特城仍然不是利物浦和曼城的對手，但在英超「爭四」中攪局，並奪得一張下賽季歐冠門票的可能性還是很大的。11輪過後，他們已領先排在第5位的阿森納6分，比第10和11位的曼聯與熱刺多出10分。現在，人們已不會再忽視這支曾經創造過奇蹟的球隊了。
曼聯不敵保級隊 破33年紀錄本賽季，曼聯開局戰況不佳，但隨著賽季深入，他們逐漸找到了贏球的狀態，在逼平了「領頭羊」利物浦後，又戰勝了諾維奇，還在聯賽盃中淘汰了切爾西，本輪面對保級球隊——伯恩茅斯，不少「紅魔」球迷相信，球隊會毫無壓力的全取「三分」。
結果，曼聯在客場遭到了伯恩茅斯的頑強抵抗。在上半場比賽最後時刻，主隊利用曼聯防線的漏洞，打破場上僵局，取得1：0領先。下半場，伯恩茅斯的反擊踢得更加犀利，只因運氣稍差，主隊未能擴大比分。

最終，伯恩茅斯在主場1：0擊敗了曼聯。主場上萬球迷瘋狂地慶祝球隊打破了對陣「紅魔」不勝的尷尬歷史，而對曼聯來講，這一戰不僅丟掉三分，而且還破了球隊33年以來最差積分紀錄。11輪比賽過後，曼聯3勝4平4負，積13分，高出降級區5分，排在積分榜第10位。11輪13分是曼聯自1986/87賽季以來的最低積分。
英媒：曼聯被沙特財團收購在本輪開賽前，英格蘭媒體爆出，來自沙特的投資者以30億英鎊的高價，已經完成對曼聯的收購，俱樂部的代表團已經飛往了沙特，現在就等曼聯官方宣布。這一消息令曼聯球迷非常高興。
2005年，來自美國的格雷澤家族僅花費5億英鎊，便將「紅魔」收入囊中。近幾年，曼聯老闆把球隊當做賺錢的工具，讓曼聯球迷相當不滿。此前《太陽報》行過的一次民調顯示，8000名曼聯球迷中有91%的人願意讓來自沙特的投資人收購球隊。
很多聯球球迷認為，球隊近來戰績不佳，格雷澤家族是罪魁禍首。若被財大氣粗的沙特財團收購獲，對曼聯來講，絕對是個好消息。
