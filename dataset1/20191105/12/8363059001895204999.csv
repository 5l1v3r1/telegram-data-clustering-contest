Eco-Conscious Brand House of Marley Unveils Its First Noise Cancelling Headphones
05 Nov 2019, 12:40 by Shabana Arif
The Exodus ANC is the brand's first active noise cancelling, wireless headphones, so you can be anti-social and eco-friendly at the same time.
Made of FSC-certified wood and recyclable aluminium, with memory foam ear cups and a padded headband, the Exodus ANC headphones are the newest addition to House of Marley's lineup, although they do make you look somewhat like an alien with those little antenna on the sides.
The ears are stuffed with 50mm hi-definition drivers and you can squeeze up to 80 hours battery life out of them with ANC off and 28 hours with ANC on. Observe this youth wandering around the world with them:



“The Exodus ANC is our most elite headphone to date. From the sleek and timeless look of the sustainable materials including custom stained ash wood ear cups, down to the quick charge capability, noise cancellation and audio performance, the Exodus ANC rival those of premium over-ear wireless ANC headphones,” said House of Marley director of product development, Josh Poulsen.
“We’re excited to build on the positive response on our headphone range, by adding noise-cancellation and a step up in comfort and performance. We anticipate the Exodus ANC to become a must-have for those looking for a sustainably designed alternative to over-ear ANC headphones without sacrificing superior quality.”
The headphones also feature an microphone, monitoring mode, and remote functionality, and you can juice them up with quick charge, taking three hours for a full charge, and just 15 minutes for six hours.
You can grab yourself a pair for £199.99 over on the House of Marley website.
