Jozi Stars turn to Bavuma to lead in MSL

05 Nov 2019, 12:49

Cape Town - Temba Bavuma will captain the Jozi Stars in the upcoming 2019 Mzansi Super League, the franchise has confirmed.
The 29-year-old was recently given the vice-captaincy in the Proteas Test side before they were hammered 3-0 in their series away in India. 
Bavuma is also understood to be on the verge of a push in the Proteas' limited overs sides and he was a part of the side that played two T20Is in India in September. 
He will now be looking to make a statement in this year's MSL as the Stars look to defend the title they won in the first edition of the MSL last year. 
The Stars will host the Cape Town Blitz, captained by Quinton de Kock, in the first match of the 2019 competition this Friday. 
All matches will be televised on SABC 3.
