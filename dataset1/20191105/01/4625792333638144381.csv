Morning Joe hosts spend four seconds on Trump tax move after Scarborough did same thing last year
05 Nov 2019, 01:29 by John Gage
MSNBC's Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski spent only four seconds on their show to mention President Trump was leaving New York to avoid the steep taxes.
Brzezinski mentioned the move in a brief of morning headlines but failed to mention where and why the president was leaving New York.
Trump announced Thursday that he was moving his permanent residency from New York to Florida to avoid paying more in taxes.



Page Six reported in January that the hosts of Morning Joe had also moved their legal residency to Florida in order to save over $500,000 a year in taxes. Scarborough registered to vote in Florida in October 2018.
The couple have a home studio they film in with a Washington, D.C., backdrop in order to meet residency requirements.



The two have been fierce critics of the president, but neither has offered any commentary of what they think of his move to Florida to avoid a higher tax burden.
