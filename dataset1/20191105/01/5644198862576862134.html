      <p>Barcelona defender Nelson Semedo says the team must improve if they are to win the Champions League following their disappointing defeat by Levante in La Liga at the weekend.</p>
      <p>BARCELONA: Barcelona defender Nelson Semedo says the team must improve if they are to win the Champions League following their disappointing defeat by Levante in La Liga at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Catalans last won the European competition in 2015. Since then they have been eliminated at the quarter-final stage three times and were denied a place in the final last season by eventual champions Liverpool.</p>

      <p>The team has been criticised by Spanish media after their shock 3-1 loss at Levante on Saturday, despite staying top of La Liga.</p>
      <p>Barcelona host Slavia Prague on Tuesday in the Champions League in Group F, which they top by three points from Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund on four each.</p>
      <p>"We have to improve a lot, a lot, but don't forget we have a draw and two wins and in general we had seven wins in a row, but of course we have to improve," Semedo told a news conference on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We have to take advantage of the Slavia game to correct errors and offer a response.Â It's an important game tomorrow. If we win, we take a step forward in the Champions League and I think we're going to see a reaction (from the defeat)."</p>
      <p>Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde conceded his team faced more scrutiny after the defeat in Valencia.</p>
      <p>"It's clear that when you lose you're under more pressure, we know what it means to lose at this club," Valverde said.</p>
      <p>"A lot of fuss is always generated and I think that for us that's good because it obliges you to react.</p>
      <p>"We always feel obligated (to perform) because they even generate fuss when you win and you haven't had a great game. We usually react well and I expect the same tomorrow."</p>
