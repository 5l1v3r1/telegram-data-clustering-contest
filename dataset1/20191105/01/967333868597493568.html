      <p>A senior Turkish official claimed Turkey captured the older sister of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, previously <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911041077223459-black-gold-who-controls-syrias-oil-and-how-much-is-it-all-worth/">killed during a US raid</a> in Syria’s Idlib province, AP <a href="https://apnews.com/408024c45d9d4c13b0b480987ab8a153">reported</a> Monday.</p>
      <p>The official called the arrest an “intelligence gold mine,” the report says.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the 65-year old woman, named Rasmiya Awad, was captured in a raid conducted Monday. Awad was living in a trailer near the town of Azaz, north of Aleppo, a region under Turkish control since 2016 Operation Euphrates Shield.</p>
      <blockquote>"This kind of thing is an intelligence gold mine. What she knows about [Daesh*] can significantly expand our understanding of the group and help us catch more bad guys," the official said, according to AP.</blockquote>
      <p>The Turkish official said Awad was taken into custody along with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children. The adults are reportedly being interrogated. Rasmiya is suspected to be affiliated with the Daesh terror group, the official said, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077208499-no-one-seems-to-know-how-trump-learned-that-daesh-chief-baghdadi-died-a-crying-death/">without providing further detail</a>.</p>
      <p>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whose real name was Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri (according to The Daily Telegraph), was an Iraqi from the town of Samarra, north of Baghdad. He <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911031077215483-biden-compares-trumps-syrian-oil-theft-policy-to-giant-300-foot-daesh-recruiting-poster/">was reported dead</a> as a result of a US special operations raid last month. His death was later confirmed by the terror group.</p>
