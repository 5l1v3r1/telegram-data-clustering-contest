      <h1>"B-52s for Israel": One Really Bad Idea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T01:30:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Robert Farley</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Point:</b> If the United States sold planes to Israel that then were used to attack Iran, the Iranians would probably still see the U.S. as culpable in the attack and respond.</p>
      <p>In April 2014, retired Air Force lieutenant general <a href="http://www.warisboring.com/articles/why-america-wants-a-new-bomber/">David Deptula</a> and Michael Makovsky of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304418404579462970629373280?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304418404579462970629373280.html">penned an op-ed</a> for The Wall Street Journal arguing that the United States should turn over a dozen surplus B-52 heavy bombers to Israel.</p>
      <p>Deptula and Makovsky said that the eight-engine B-52s should come with a consignment of America’s special Massive Ordnance Penetrators—gigantic bombs tailored for smashing buried facilities. Specifically, nuclear facilities.</p>
      <p>“B-52s for Israel,” as we’ve dubbed it, is a silly little proposal with approximately zero chance of actually being implemented. And it’s possible Deptula and Makovsky don’t even mean for anyone to take its details seriously.</p>
      <p>Their bomber idea could be part of a media game of sorts, one that certain political constituencies are playing in order to broadly influencepolicy, rather than comprise policy.</p>
      <p>But just for fun, let’s consider “B-52s for Israel” as a sober proposal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bombers versus Iran:</b>
      </p>
      <p>MOP is a precision-guided gravity bomb. So a B-52 cannot deploy it from standoff range. The bomber has to get close to the target.</p>
      <p>The B-52 is slow. This is why you don’t normally fly the giant warplane <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Eleven-Days-Christmas-Americas/dp/1893554279/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=lawgunandmon-20&amp;linkCode=w01&amp;creativeASIN=1893554279">through contested air space</a>. In 1972, the North Vietnamese shot down a staggering 16 B-52s in 11 days during Operation Linebacker II.</p>
      <p>The Iranian air force flies hundreds of MiG-29s, F-7s, F-4s and F-5s and a couple squadrons of U.S.-made F-14s, pictured, that might still wield a version of the long-range Phoenix missile. Any of these jets could intercept Israeli B-52s.</p>
