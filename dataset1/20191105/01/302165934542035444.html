      <p>BERLIN, Nov 5 — German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government yesterday strongly condemned death threats against two leading Green party politicians by a neo-Nazi group, as concern mounts over a rise in right-wing extremism.</p>
      <p>Greens lawmaker Cem Ozdemir, who has Turkish roots, revealed at the weekend that police were investigating an email he had received from a neo-Nazi group saying he was at the top of their kill list.</p>
      <p>“We are currently planning how and when to execute you. At the next rally? Or will we get you outside your home?” the email read, according to the Funke newspaper group.</p>
      <p>Fellow Greens MP Claudia Roth received a message saying she was second in line to be killed.</p>
      <p>Both emails were sent on October 27 and signed with “Nuclear Weapons Division Germany” (AWD), apparently a German offshoot of a notorious US-based neo-Nazi group.</p>
      <p>“The German government clearly condemns any kind of threats or violence against politicians,” Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We cannot and will not accept these attacks on our free democratic system,” she said, vowing to use the full force of the law against the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the same press conference, interior ministry spokesman Steve Alter said federal security services “have already had this group in their sights for some time.”</p>
      <p>The American version of the AWD, founded in 2015-2016, has been linked to five murders in the United States, he added.</p>
      <p>The German branch is thought to count several dozen members.</p>
      <p>
        <b>White rose</b>
      </p>
      <p>The death threats come with German politicians already on high alert following the murder last June of local pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke in the western city of Kassel, allegedly by a known neo-Nazi.</p>
      <p>In October, two people were shot dead in a far-right attack in the eastern city of Halle where the gunman had first tried and failed to storm a packed synagogue.</p>
      <p>And in regional elections in the state of Thuringia late last month, Greens co-leader Robert Habeck and a local candidate from Merkel's CDU party received death threats from suspected far-right extremists.</p>
      <p>Faced with growing calls for action, Merkel's government last week proposed a raft of measures to crack down on the far-right, with a focus on targeting weapons sales and online hate speech.</p>
      <p>But lawmakers from across the political spectrum have in recent days pleaded for more urgency in the fight against the far-right.</p>
      <p>During a visit to the eastern city of Zwickau yesterday, Merkel placed a single white rose at a memorial tree in honour of the victims of a neo-Nazi terror cell that killed 10 people between 2000 and 2007.</p>
      <p>The government “would do everything in its power” to make sure “these things never happen again,” Merkel vowed. — AFP</p>
