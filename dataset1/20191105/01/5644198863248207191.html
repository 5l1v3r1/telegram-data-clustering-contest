      <p>SEATTLE/WASHINGTON: Boeing said on Monday (Nov 5) that one of three parachutes failed to deploy during an otherwise successful safety test of its unmanned CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, being developed to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>The deployment failure happened during a so-called pad abort test of a system designed to propel the crew to safety in the event of an emergency, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said by email.</p>

      <p>"It's too early to determine why all three main parachutes did not deploy," Blecher said. "However, having two of three deploy successfully is acceptable for the test parameters and crew safety."</p>
      <p>Blecher said overall the test on Monday morning was successful.</p>
      <p>Boeing and US space agency NASA said they were still targeting Dec 17 for the Starliner's first unpiloted mission to the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>NASA has picked Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX as the main contractors to build rocket-and-capsule launch systems to return Americans to the orbiting research lab for the first time since the US space shuttle programme ended in 2011.</p>
      <p>Parachute deployment has been among the top technical challenges both companies have faced that have raised questions over crew safety and pressured launch schedules. </p>
      <p>The parachutes are designed to slow down the capsules when they return to Earth at supersonic speeds.</p>
      <p>SpaceX is working to fly its Crew Dragon capsule on a first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, after completing its unmanned test in March, the company and NASA have said.</p>
      <p>NASA in a press release called the test “acceptable” and echoed what Boeing said in its statement.</p>
