PROFESSIONAL recruitment agency Vanrath has bought Victoria House in Belfast city centre from Aviva in a £12.5m sale managed by Lambert Smith Hampton and Riddell McKibbin.
The acquisition of the 58,000 sq ft grade A development on Gloucester Street is one of the most significant commercial property deals in the city this year.
Vanrath will occupy vacant space on the eighth floor of the building to drive forward its ambitious plans for expansion in the recruitment sector.
The 11-storey Victoria House also plays host to a range of tenant businesses including Arthur Cox Solicitors, Oracle, Zurich Insurance and Keenan Corporate Finance.
Vanrath owners Wayne Sullivan and Neil McKibbin said: “Victoria House is a strategic acquisition of a prime office building in Belfast city centre that complements our established and rapidly expanding recruitment business alongside our property portfolio interests.
“We are excited about moving the business to Victoria House and providing the highest quality workspace for our consultants.”
Rowena Crowley, senior asset manager of Aviva added: “Victoria House is part of our UK Property Select Fund. The sale forms part of our ongoing strategic review of the fund and further represents the strength of the assets we hold, completing a sale in a Brexit looming market.”
Martin McCloy, director of capital markets at Lambert Smith Hampton, which acquired Victoria House for them back in 2014, said: “The market has been starved of stock in recent months, but this transaction shows that where there are willing buyers and willing sellers, deals can be done.”
Jonathan Elder, corporate banking manager at Danske Bank, which financed the acquisition, said: “It is great to see an ambitious company like Vanrath showing its confidence in the local economy and the future growth potential of its business by making such an important strategic investment in the city centre.”
