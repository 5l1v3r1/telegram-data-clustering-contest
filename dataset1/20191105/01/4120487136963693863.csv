加强对地方政府的监督

05 Nov 2019, 01:47

文/邝耀章有的地方政府缺乏监督机构，所以并不奇怪，不管是否有或没有地方政府内部的监督机构（APIP），别名是地方检查机构，至今地方政府的贪污腐败现象仍然盛行。贪污腐败在地方政府越来越普遍，这反映了地方上的监督机制不完善或薄弱，甚至根本不存在。由于地方监察机构是一群流放者的场所，所以造成地方上的监察机构很弱。具有讽刺意味的是，监察机构经常与作为其主管的地方首长一起进行贪污腐败。地方政府监督机构(APIP)无法监督地方首长，因为他直接在地方首长的领导之下。关于地方政府的2014年第23号法律第216条第（3）款规定，地方政府监督机构通过地方政府秘书履行对地方首长负责。不管是否有意或无意，地方政府监督机构(APIP)都被安置于地方首长之下。它不是独立的，因此它的存在对消除腐败和改善地方政府治理没有有效的作用。若想要将APIP安置于独立机构，当然需要修订《地方政府法》。修改法令需要很长时间，而地方政府的紧急情况已经很严重。因此，总统佐科威总统于2019年10月14日发布了2019年第72号地方政府法令。该法令是对PP 18/2016的修订，成为了《地方政府法》的实施法规。PP 72/2019中的规定为APIP提供了一种新鲜血液，以加强监督职能。在PP中，如果可能滥用职权或损失国家资金，则地方检查机构无需等待地方的指派。检查结果必须报告给省级检查部长，如果发生在地区/城市级别，则要报告给省长。PP还强调了地方检查机构作为地方政府的监督要素的存在。 在履行职责时，地方监察局必须履行及协调预防贪污腐败等职能。希望将检查机构的监督结果用作对腐败的警钟，以便并非每年都有地方官员因为贪污腐败而被肃贪会(KPK)逮捕。不幸的是，PP 72/2019没有更详细地说明预防腐败协调的实施方法。例如，如果发现了腐败指控，则地区检查局可以直接与执法人员进行协调，从而避免根据风俗解决贪污腐败指控。尽管地方政府没有受到监管，但如果发现可疑犯罪，地方检查机构必须主动与警察和检察官进行协调。在PP 72/2019中，加强地方视察机构地位的政治意愿非常强烈。据指出，解雇或调动省级地方监察员的机制必须通过与内政部长的书面协商。对于地区/市级区域检查员，将通过省长进行书面协商。希望地方检查机构对任命、解雇和调动进行密切和分级的监督，希望地方机构将不再是最后处置的场所。若地方机构所以享有盛誉，是因为它充满了可信赖和可信任的人。当然，加强地方视察机构的作用和能力的目的是使该机构在打击地方法规的实践中更加独立和客观。在其作用和能力得到加强之后，监察局的存在得以充实，因此其缺席情况很奇怪。但是，如果将来贪污腐败现象仍然猖獗，地方视察局将被扔进大海。

Strengthen supervision of local governments

05 Nov 2019, 01:47

There is a lack of supervisory institutions in the local government, so it is not surprising that, with or without local government supervision agencies (APIP), aliases are local inspection agencies, and corruption of local governments is still prevalent. Corruption is becoming more common in local governments, reflecting the imperfection or weakness of local supervision mechanisms, or even non-existence. Since the local inspection agency is a place for a group of exiles, the local inspection agency is weak. Ironically, the inspectorate often engages in corruption with the local head of the department. The Local Government Oversight Agency (APIP) is unable to oversee the local head because he is directly under the leadership of the local head. Article 216 (3) of the Law No. 23 of 2014 on the local government stipulates that the local government supervisory agency shall be responsible to the local heads through the local government secretary. Local government oversight bodies (APIPs) are placed under local heads, whether intentional or not. It is not independent, so its existence has no effective effect on eliminating corruption and improving local government governance. If you want to place the APIP in an independent institution, you will need to amend the Local Government Act. It takes a long time to amend the decree, and the emergency situation of the local government is already very serious. Therefore, President Zogway issued the Local Government Decree No. 72 of 2019 on October 14, 2019. The decree is a revision of PP 18/2016 and has become the implementation of the Local Government Act. The provisions in PP 72/2019 provide a fresh blood for the APIP to strengthen the oversight function. In the PP, if it is possible to abuse authority or lose state funds, the local inspection agency does not have to wait for the assignment of the place. The results of the inspection must be reported to the provincial inspection minister and, if it occurs at the regional/city level, to the governor. PP also emphasized the existence of local inspection agencies as the supervisory elements of local governments. In performing their duties, the local inspectorate must perform and coordinate functions such as preventing corruption. It is hoped that the inspection results of the inspection agency will be used as a warning to corruption so that local officials are not arrested every year for corruption by the KPK. Unfortunately, PP 72/2019 does not describe in more detail the implementation of the prevention of corruption coordination. For example, if corruption allegations are discovered, the District Inspectorate can coordinate directly with law enforcement officials to avoid allegations of corruption based on customs. Although local governments are not regulated, local inspection agencies must actively coordinate with the police and prosecutors if suspicious crimes are discovered. In PP 72/2019, the political will to strengthen the status of local inspection agencies is very strong. It was pointed out that the mechanism for dismissal or mobilization of provincial local ombudsmen must be in written consultation with the Minister of the Interior. For regional/municipal area inspectors, a written consultation will be conducted through the governor. It is hoped that local inspection agencies will closely and hierarchically supervise appointments, dismissals and transfers, and hope that local institutions will no longer be the final disposal sites. If a local institution is well known, it is because it is full of trustworthy and trustworthy people. Of course, the purpose of strengthening the role and capacity of local inspection agencies is to make the institution more independent and objective in the practice of combating local regulations. After its role and capacity have been strengthened, the presence of the Inspectorate has been enriched, so its absence is strange. However, if corruption is still rampant in the future, the local inspection bureau will be thrown into the sea.
