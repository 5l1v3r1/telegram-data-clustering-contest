WATCH: Historic barge stuck above Niagara Falls breaks loose
05 Nov 2019, 01:11 by John Gage
Park officials announced a historic, abandoned barge that was nestled above Niagara Falls shifted its position and moved, before getting stuck again.
""The severe weather conditions experienced yesterday have caused the iron scow, which has remained lodged in the powerful upper rapids above the Falls for over a century, to shift significantly from its position,"" the park officials said Friday on their Twitter account.



The iron scow has been stuck above the falls since 1918, but weather caused it to move down the river. Parks staff said they would monitor any future potential movement by the barge.
