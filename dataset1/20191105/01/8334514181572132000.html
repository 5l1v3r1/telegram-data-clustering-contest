      <p>GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan President-elect Alejandro Giammattei said on Monday that he will break off all diplomatic relations with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro when he takes office on Jan. 14.</p>
      <p>The center-right Giammattei, who won a run-off election in August, told reporters his incoming administration will instead recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s leader.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s the right thing to do. There are other South American (governments) that will do the same,” he said, without going into further detail.</p>
