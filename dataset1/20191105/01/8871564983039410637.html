      <h1>Now serving: Jollibee’s cheesy breakfast pies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T01:18:47+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 01:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Manila" target="_blank">Coconuts Manila</a></address>
      <p>What with traffic snarls and hours-long commutes, it can be tough for Manileños to have a sit-down breakfast. That’s why we say screw a sit-down breakfast! Stuff your pie-hole standing up, with Jollibee’s new offering: breakfast hand pies!</p>

        <b>Read: <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/food-drink/coco-nuts-rejoice-jollibee-introduces-its-own-version-of-buko-pie/">Coco-nuts, Rejoice: Jollibee introduces its own version of buko pie</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The hot, crispy pies come in two versions: Cheesy Corned Beef and Cheesy Bacon. Each come with their respective meats plopped into a glistening, deep-fried crust with cheese and mashed potato for a mere PHP49 each (less than US$1). And with all the fried dough, processed meat, and dairy fat that active bodies crave, they’re a healthy part of a balanced breakfast!**</p>
      <p>The pies will be available starting today and until further notice in stores across Luzon. They’re available for dine-in, take-out, drive-through, or delivery.</p>

      <p>Jollibee, of course, needs no introduction, having made its name with its famed crispy Chicken Joy, and its uniquely sweet, hotdog-topped Jollibee Spaghetti — two bona fide staples anywhere Filipinos are found.</p>
