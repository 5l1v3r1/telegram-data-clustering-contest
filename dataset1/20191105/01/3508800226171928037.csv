打傳媒打傳媒打，香港記者反抗！
05 Nov 2019, 01:25 by 休班記者


我們想讓你知道的是若不是抱有那份天真的理想，傳媒工作者不會踏足這個行業，示威者亦不會走上街頭。或者「風骨」就是如此一件事。



「紅白藍」曾是香港八九十年代輝煌的象徵；今日卻成本港傳媒悲歌，在新聞界掀起風風雨雨。
紅，是為「紅色資本」。中資入主香港傳媒，CCTVB、《香港01》、《明報》，甚至《有線電視》都無一倖免……「江山一片紅」令自我審查愈趨嚴重。
白，是「白色恐怖」。近期針對本港記者的起底及批鬥日益嚴重，親中記者有意無意拍下其他記者樣貌，再在網上公開流傳；更有記者在中國的親屬，曾被特別「關心」及「問候」……
藍，是一眾「藍絲」。這班被假新聞養成的人如同網絡喪屍，口殊筆伐一班遵從新聞操守的記者，甚至對他們動武。
種種問題，早已令本港新聞自由不斷倒退。無國界記者組織4月發表2019年世界新聞自由指數，香港在180個國家及地區中僅排名73，被歸類為第三級「問題顯著」。組織當時一語成讖，指出一旦香港通過23條或修訂《逃犯條例》，必然對新聞自由帶來負面影響。
而事實是條例未過，紅白藍再染上一片「黑」，足已令本港新聞自由一落千丈：辱罵、無理拘捕、強光照射、強扯面罩、濫噴胡椒水、亂射橡膠子……警方暴力對待「記者朋友」的惡行可謂罄竹難書。
香港的現今與那些發展中國家，原來是是這麼近。排名第138位的緬甸，當局操縱社交網絡，兩名路透社記者更在2018年因報道羅興亞人危機，被控違反《政府機密法》遭囚禁逾500天後才獲特赦。中國呢？排名倒數第四，除了一眾維權人士無理被捕外，曾報道香港反送中運動的獨立記者黃雪琴，近期亦疑被刑事拘留，音訊全無。
港共政權打壓新聞自由之心，可謂昭然若揭。盡忠職守的新聞工作者被警方視為仇人，冠以「黑記」之名稱呼，亦不難理解。在大是大非之時，侵犯人權的人往往就是警方這些被賦予公權力的部門。示威者會被警方拘捕和起訴，而記者作為第四權，更多是去監察警方有否濫用公權力。這種監察角色，對「身有屎」的黑警來說，有如眼中釘。

本港的新聞自由受《基本法》[1]、《香港人權法案條例》[2]及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》（公約）等保障。聯合國人權事務委員會2011年就公約第19條發表的《第34號一般性意見》更指出，限制新聞記者和人權調查員的行動自由，一般會牴觸公約。
警方收緊查冊、驅趕記者及阻礙採訪行為，或是「831」的舉動，早已違反上述公約及法律。按國際標準，更是相去甚遠。《約翰奈斯堡原則》第十九條指出，各國政府不得阻止人權觀察員和傳媒進入有合理理由相信人權正在或已經受侵犯的地方。即使是在發生暴力的地區，亦不應驅逐觀察員，除非其存在對他人安全構成明顯威脅。
揭露真相、監察權貴是社會授予記者的天職，亦是責任所在。一眾記者工作時拋開立場保持中立，亦無意成為新聞主角，但面對種種濫用暴力及妨礙新聞自由的舉措，在「無法可依、有法不依、無法限權、無法達義」的香港，亦不得不為此發聲。
聯合國秘書長古特雷斯11月2日指出，近年全球針對記者人身安全的攻擊行為，以及阻礙他們工作的事件愈演愈烈，呼籲國際社會挺身而出，共同支持記者，支持真相。記者、學者或網民有系統地收集警方侵犯新聞自由的案例，連結國際組織及全球，未嘗不是一個好方法，不過最重要還是在本地捍衛僅存的新聞自由。
站在紛亂的最前線，同時守護言論自由最後堡壘的記者朋友，大家的筆和鏡頭不應是政權的喉舌。既然警方有自己渠道（26萬讚好的Facebook專頁）發聲，問答環節又廢話連篇，槍口對外杯葛警方記者會其實並無不可（在私，這些貼錢幫黑警宣傳的直播早應收皮）。

誠言，杯葛也好，走精面也好，在紅白藍當道的香港傳媒界並不容易，亦似乎太過理想。但若不是抱有那份天真的理想，大家亦不會踏足這個行業，示威者亦不會走上街頭。或者「風骨」就是如此一件事。
最後筆者重申，本人在工作上仍會堅守不偏不倚的原則，休班後的言論不代表所有記者立場。一日未光復香港，我都唔會自殺，繼續以「一張紙、一支筆、一張摺凳」，做自己應為對的事。
註：

《基本法》第二十七條：「香港居民享有言論、新聞、出版的自由，結社、集會、遊行、示威的自由，組織和參加工會、罷工的權利和自由」；《基本法》第三十九條：「《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》（公約）適用於香港的有關規定繼續有效，透過香港特別行政區的法律予以實施……」
《香港人權法案條例》（香港法例第383條）第十六條（二）：「人人有發表自由之權利；此種權利包括以語言、文字或出版物、藝術或自己選擇之其他方式，不分國界，尋求、接受及傳播各種消息及思想之自由。」

Playing the media to fight the media, Hong Kong reporters resist!
05 Nov 2019, 01:25 by Off-duty reporter


What we want you to know is that if you don't have that innocent ideal, media workers will not set foot in this industry, and demonstrators will not take to the streets. Or ""wind bone"" is such a thing.



""Red, White and Blue"" was once a symbol of Hong Kong's glory in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is a tragic story of the Hong Kong media, and it has caused ups and downs in the press.
Red is for ""red capital."" Chinese-funded Hong Kong media, CCTVB, ""Hong Kong 01"", ""Ming Pao"", and even ""Cable TV"" are all spared... ""Jiangshan is red"" makes self-censorship more serious.
White is ""white horror."" Recently, the bottoming and criticism of Hong Kong reporters has become increasingly serious. The pro-China journalists have intentionally and unintentionally photographed other reporters and then circulated on the Internet. Some of the relatives of journalists in China have been specially ""cared"" and ""greeted""... ...
Blue is a group of ""blue silk."" This group of people who have been made up of fake news is like a network zombie. They have written a group of reporters who follow the news and even use force against them.
All kinds of problems have already caused the freedom of the press in Hong Kong to regress. Reporters Without Borders published the World Press Freedom Index for 2019 in April. Hong Kong ranks only 73 out of 180 countries and regions and is classified as a third-level ""problem."" At the time, the organization became a slogan, pointing out that once Hong Kong passed 23 or amended the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, it would inevitably have a negative impact on freedom of the press.
The fact is that the Ordinance has not passed, and the red, white and blue have been stained with ""black"". This has already caused Hong Kong's freedom of the press to plummet: insults, unreasonable arrests, glare, strong masks, sparse peppers, rubber shots... The violent treatment of ""journalist friends"" can be described as difficult.
Hong Kong's present and developing countries are so close. Ranked 138th in Myanmar, the authorities manipulated social networks. Two Reuters reporters were stunned in 2018 for reporting the Rohingya crisis and being accused of violating the Government Secrets Act for more than 500 days. What about China? In the bottom of the ranking, in addition to the unjustified arrest of a group of activists, Huang Xueqin, an independent journalist who reported that Hong Kong’s anti-send campaign, was suspected of being criminally detained in the near future.
The Hong Kong communist regime’s suppression of the freedom of the press can be described as clear. It is not difficult to understand that a dedicated journalist is regarded as an enemy by the police and is called ""Black"". At the height of the big picture, those who violate human rights are often the police departments that have been given public power. Demonstrators will be arrested and prosecuted by the police, and as a fourth right, journalists are more likely to monitor whether the police abuse public power. This kind of supervisory role is like a black-eyed policeman.

The freedom of the press in Hong Kong is protected by the Basic Law[1], the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance[2] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant). The General Comment No. 34 issued by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2011 on article 19 of the Convention also states that restrictions on the freedom of movement of journalists and human rights investigators generally conflict with the Convention.
The police’s tightening of searches, expulsion of journalists and obstructing interviews, or the “831” move, have long violated the above-mentioned conventions and laws. According to international standards, it is a far cry. Article 19 of the Johannesburg Principles states that governments must not prevent human rights observers and the media from entering places where there are reasonable grounds for believing that human rights are or have been violated. Even in areas where violence occurs, observers should not be expelled unless their existence poses a significant threat to the safety of others.
Exposing the truth and supervising the dignitaries is the vocation of the society to give reporters, and it is also the responsibility. When a group of journalists work, they stand out from the standpoint and remain neutral. They also do not intend to become the protagonists of the news. However, in the face of various measures of abuse of violence and impediment to the freedom of the press, Hong Kong is ""not able to rely on, can’t rely on the law, can’t limit power, and can’t be righteous."" I also have to speak for it.
UN Secretary-General Guterres pointed out on November 2 that in recent years, the global attacks on the personal safety of journalists and the incidents that hinder their work have intensified, calling on the international community to come forward and support journalists and support the truth. It is a good idea for journalists, academics or netizens to systematically collect cases of police infringement of freedom of the press, linking international organizations and the world, but the most important thing is to defend the remaining freedom of the press locally.
Standing at the forefront of the chaos, while guarding the reporters and friends of the last bastion of freedom of speech, everyone’s pen and lens should not be the mouthpiece of the regime. Since the police have their own channels (260,000 good Facebook pages), the question and answer session is nonsense, and the guns are not inevitable for the police. The private news, these money to help the police broadcast the live broadcast early skin).

Honesty, whether it is a good boy or a good face, it is not easy to be in the red, white and blue media industry. It seems too ideal. But if you don't have that innocent ideal, you will not set foot in this industry, and the demonstrators will not take to the streets. Or ""wind bone"" is such a thing.
Finally, the author reiterates that I will still adhere to the principle of impartiality in my work. The speech after the off-duty does not represent the position of all journalists. If I have not recovered from Hong Kong in one day, I will commit suicide and continue to do what I should be right with ""a piece of paper, a pen, and a folding stool.""
Note:

Article 27 of the Basic Law: ""Hong Kong residents enjoy freedom of speech, news and publication, freedom of association, assembly, procession, demonstration, organization and participation in trade unions, right to strike and freedom""; Article 39 of the Basic Law Article: ""The relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant) applicable to Hong Kong shall continue to be effective and shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ...""
Article 16 (2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Article 383 of the Laws of Hong Kong): ""Everyone has the right to freedom of expression; such rights include language, words or publications, art or other means of their choice, Seeking, accepting and disseminating the freedom of all kinds of news and ideas regardless of national boundaries.""
