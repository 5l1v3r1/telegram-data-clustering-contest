      <p>JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (WABC) -- Police are searching for the driver who left the scene after a crash in New Jersey that left a pedestrian critically injured.</p>
      <p>It happened shortly after 11 p.m. on Halloween night at the intersection of Christopher Columbus Drive and Grove Street in Jersey City.</p>
      <p>A 36-year-old Jersey City man was struck by a 2008-2010 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, said Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez.</p>
      <p>The vehicle then continued east on Christopher Columbus Avenue before turning north on Greene Street.</p>
      <p>The man remains in critical but stable condition at Jersey City Medical Center.</p>
      <p>Authorities released surveillance photos of the vehicle, describing it as light in color, possibly gray or silver.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe that the minivan has side mirrors that are black and the passenger side mirror might be missing from the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The minivan has window tinting on the rear windows and would likely have damage to the lower right side of the front bumper area.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the collision is asked to contact the Regional Collision Investigation Unit at 201-915-1345.</p>
