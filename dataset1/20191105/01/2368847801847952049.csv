韓國情報院:未來兩個月內或敲定第4次川金會

05 Nov 2019, 01:28

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】韓國情報院（NIS）週一透露，已掌握的情報顯示，朝鮮領導人金正恩正計劃在接下來的兩個月內，與美方敲定再次與美國總統川普（特朗普）會晤事宜。
據《韓聯社》報導，韓國國家情報院11月4日在接受國會不公開的國政質詢中披露了上述訊息。NIS表示，預估朝鮮可能在11月至12月初就會先爭取和美方展開高層會談，以便敲定第4次「川金會」。
這些資訊是共同民主黨議員金民基（音譯）與自由韓國黨議員李恩載（音譯）走出會場向記者公布。
情報院稱，朝鮮當局目前也在討論金正恩訪問中國的事宜。考慮到今年10月6日是朝鮮與中國建交70週年，再參照金正恩在前2次「川金會」前的動向，金正恩今年訪中的可能性也是情報院密切關注的事項。
2018年6月川普和金正恩在新加坡首度舉行了高峰會晤，拉開了朝鮮半島無核化的序幕。今年2月底，川普和金正恩在越南河內的第二次會晤因雙方提出的要求差距太大不歡而散，令朝鮮棄核的進程遭遇嚴重挫折。今年6月30日，川普親臨板門店非軍事區與金正恩進行了一次非正式的會晤，讓已陷入僵局的美朝談判又有了轉機，川普也在板門店成為首位踏上朝鮮領土的美國總統。

Korea Information Institute: In the next two months or finalize the 4th Sichuan Gold Council

05 Nov 2019, 01:28

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] The South Korean Information Service (NIS) revealed on Monday that the information already available indicates that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is planning to finalize with the US president again in the next two months. Trump (Trump) meeting.
According to the ""Yonhap News Agency"" report, the South Korean National Intelligence Agency disclosed the above message on November 4th in a national political inquiry that was not open to Congress. NIS said that it is estimated that North Korea may first seek high-level talks with the US from November to early December in order to finalize the fourth ""Chuanjin Association.""
The information was announced by the Common Democratic Party member Kim Min Ki and the Liberal Party member Li Enzai (transliteration) from the venue.
The Intelligence Agency said that the North Korean authorities are also discussing Kim’s visit to China. Considering that October 6 this year is the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and China, and referring to Kim Jong-un’s move ahead of the previous two “Chuanjin Meetings”, the possibility of Kim Jong-un’s visit this year is also a matter of close concern to the Intelligence Institute.
In June 2018, Trump and Kim Jong-un held the first summit meeting in Singapore, which opened the prelude to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. At the end of February this year, the second meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, was too disappointing because of the gap between the two sides. The process of North Korea’s nuclear abandonment suffered serious setbacks. On June 30 this year, Trump visited the demilitarized zone of Panmunjom and held an informal meeting with Kim Jong-un to make a turn for the US-DPRK negotiations that had reached a deadlock. Trump also became the first US president to set foot on the Korean territory in Panmunjom. .
