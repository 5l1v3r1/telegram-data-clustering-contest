      <p>Some time on November 4, former idol trainee <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/han-seo-hee">Han Seo Hee</a> was seen going Live via Instagram, along with her girlfriend/former TV personality <b>Jung Da Eun</b>. </p>
      <p>Fans of former <b>MONSTA X</b> member <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/wonho">Wonho</a> flocked to the Instagram Live to vent their anger toward the couple, calling Jung Da Eun and Han Seo Hee "attention seekers". Jung Da Eun responded, <i>"If I was an attention seeker, I would've debuted as a singer, like Wonho. If I was an attention seeker, I would've debuted as a singer like Wonho, right? But I didn't. Because I committed so many crimes in the past." </i></p>
      <p>When fans prompted her to "explain", Jung Da Eun claimed,<i> "You guys hate me, right? But Wonho and I have the same personality. So he and I are on the same level." </i>Han Seo Hee then objected to this, to which Jung Da Eun added on, <i>"Actually, I'm a little bit better [than Wonho]." </i></p>
      <p>Jung Da Eun then went on to argue with fans by stating that Wonho had no talent. <i>"Talent? What talent does he have? Dancing? You call that dance? Boo! You call that singing? No." </i></p>
