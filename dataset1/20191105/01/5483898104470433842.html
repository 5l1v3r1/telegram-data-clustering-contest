      <h3>The entire FIVEaa team’s thoughts are with Mark Bickley after his family was touched by tragedy over the weekend.</h3>
      <p>Opening the sports show on Monday, co-host Stephen Rowe told listeners:</p>
      <blockquote>“Sadly Bicks is not in today. Unexpectedly his brother David passed away Sunday morning. To Bicks, his mum Babs, dad Max, David’s family and friends -- our deepest condolences and thoughts with you in this tough time.<br/><br/>“The entire FIVEaa family are thinking of you. I cannot remember the last time we had so many calls and people passing on their best to Bicks and his family. Very hard to fathom, God bless.<br/><br/>“It’s a tough, tough time… Bicks, love ya buddy.”</blockquote>
