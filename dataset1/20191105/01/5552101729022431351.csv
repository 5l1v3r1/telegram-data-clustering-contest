中國桂林航空公司日前接獲網友舉報，一名女乘客在駕駛艙打卡，於昨（4日）發聲明祭出處分，涉事的機長遭處罰終生停飛，而其他機組員也面臨無限期停飛的處分。
一名女網紅發布在駕駛艙開心比YA打卡的照片，還發文「超級感謝機長，實在是太開心了。」讓許多網友看了吃驚，認為讓乘客任意進到駕駛艙的行為非常危險，引起廣泛討論。
有眼尖網友指出，飛機疑似是桂林航空的班機，一名資深機師研判當時飛機正在飛行中，因為模擬機上一般不會有茶杯茶具喝的飲料，此外，從儀表板設置、油門位置、氣壓轉換的顯示器和通訊頻率設置來看，都顯示飛機正在飛行中。

還有網友爆料是機長主動邀請女網紅，陸媒《澎湃新聞》記者表示，機長和這名女網紅其實是男女朋友關係。陸媒報導，這張圖片首發為微博帳號「Aaaa」，但目前該駕駛艙打卡照片已被刪除，整個微博帳號也全數清空。但根據另個「Aaaaa」的其他微博顯示，這名女網紅大學就讀於桂林某校的空乘專業，並非民航工作人員。
有網友於11月3日向桂林航空舉報，桂林航空隨即展開內部調查，並於昨日發布聲明指出，事件發生於今年1月4日GT1011桂林-揚州航班。桂林航空強調，把旅客安全放在首位，對於可能威脅航空安全的不當或不專業行為堅持零容忍。機長違反民航規章讓無關人進入駕駛艙，桂林航空決定對當事機長處以終身停飛的處分，對於其他涉事的機組員處以無限期停飛，並接受進一步調查。

儘管桂林航空接獲網友舉報後，就火速祭出處分，但仍遭網友質疑，為什麼事情整整過了10個月才處理，痛批「10個月前的事，為什麼才曝光出來？」「簡直不把乘客生命安全當回事！」
桂林航空由桂林市政府與海航集團共同籌建，2015年6月17日註冊成立；2016年6月25日正式開航。
