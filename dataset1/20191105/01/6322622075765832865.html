      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): The FBM KLCI drifted lower but stayed above the crucial 1,600-level in early trade Tuesday on some mild profit taking on index-linked stocks, led by Tenaga Nasional Bhd.</p>
      <p>At 9.05am, the FBM KLCI shed 1.55 points to 1,602.01.</p>
      <p>The early decliners included Hong Leong Bank Bhd, Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, Yinson Holdings Bhd, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd, Dufu Technology Bhd, Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd and Toyo Ink Group Bhd.</p>
      <p>Asian shares closed in on their July peak on Tuesday on increasing signs the United States and China are inching closer to a truce in their trade war and on optimism the U.S. economy is well poised for solid, consumer-driven growth, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed in early trade after hitting a four-month high the previous day, it said.</p>
      <p>CGS-CIMB Retail Research said despite the weaker-than-expected Malaysia’s September exports, the KLCI continued to gain another 10 points yesterday.</p>
      <p>It said some mild profit taking activities may take place ahead of the outcome of Bank Negara Malaysia’s OPR rate decision later today estimated at 3pm.</p>
      <p>“However, given the growing US-China trade hopes, our CGS-CIMB economist expects the next OPR cut to take place in 1H20 instead of in November.</p>
      <p>“Coupled with the overnight record-breaking Wall Street close, the local market may continue its upward momentum today. Resistance: 1,620 &amp; 1,637. Support: 1,600 &amp; 1,577,” it said.</p>
