Central Chile Rattled by Magnitude 6.3 Earthquake
The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck near Chile's Coquimbo and rocked the country's central coastal region Monday evening.

05 Nov 2019, 01:00

Early reports from the EMSC said the earthquake struck approximately 183 kilometers northwest of the Chilean capital of Santiago. 



One witness, approximately 89 kilometers from the epicenter, told the EMSC in a translated testimony that they were inside a building with a ""good structural design,"" but the quake still ""felt strong.""



Footage taken from Santiago's Plaza Italia - also known as Plaza Baquedano - shows the camera reacting to quakes felt amid ongoing protests against Chile's economic and social policies. 



Dangerous road conditions within Coquimbo's Province of Choapa IV Region have been reported, with boulders and other rocks having rolled from the mountaintops.
