失去了兩代年輕人？
05 Nov 2019, 01:30 by 蕭家怡


我們想讓你知道的是所謂的「年輕人」反政府，其實只是你們給自己的下台階，用來掩飾那個，根本男男女女、老老幼幼都不滿你的事實。



感謝香港各界婦女聯合協進會監察顧問、美心集團創辦人長女伍淑清的一番話[註]，令大家前所未有地了解到「放棄」兩個字的真義：原來沒有擁有過、之後也不會擁有的東西，也可以被你所放棄；而更重要的是，我由頭到尾都沒有感覺到伍小姐何曾著緊過年輕人，放棄與否，又有何干呢？
但除了「放棄」外，更吸引我眼球的，是伍小姐的那句：「我認為我們已經失去了整整兩代年輕人」。
在我原有的認知裏，十年是一代，但你放眼今日的香港，由七歲大的孩童到七十歲的老人家，都知道了警暴的可怕、可恨，就算借用羅致光局長的「六十歲中年」論，把六十歲及以上的不計算在內，十歲或以下的也可能只是年紀小，也足足有四、五代人呀！但好友卻提醒，現在的計法才不是「十年一代」，而是「三年一代」，果如是，那數目就更見龐大。
然而，如何計算「一代」，究竟有多少代人，或許都不是重點，因為今時今日，不滿政府處事、不恥警暴行為的，根本就不只年輕人——君不見多少銀髮族站出來、小朋友在現場大喊加油，還有那些越洋發聲的、隔岸打氣的。這一切，你們都看不見，或者選擇了不去看見。

所以，拜託你們，別再開口閉口在說「年輕人」了。因為所謂的「年輕人」反政府，其實只是你們給自己的下台階，用來掩飾那個，根本男男女女、老老幼幼都不滿你的事實。
不是教育問題，不是傳媒問題，更不是社交媒體問題，問題是，你們從來都沒有去正視問題。

Lost two generations of young people?
05 Nov 2019, 01:30 by Xiao Jiayi


What we want you to know is the so-called ""younger"" anti-government. In fact, it is only the fact that you give yourself the next step to cover up the fact that men, women, and children are not satisfied with you.



I would like to thank the Hong Kong Women's Association for the Advancement of Women's Association and the founder of the Maxim's Group, Wu Shuqing, for their words. What you have can also be abandoned by you; and more importantly, I have not felt from beginning to end that Miss Wu has ever tightened the young people, giving up or not, what is it?
But in addition to ""abandoning"", what attracts my attention is Miss Wu's sentence: ""I think we have lost two generations of young people.""
In my original knowledge, ten years is a generation, but you look at today's Hong Kong, from seven-year-old children to seventy-year-old elderly people, all know the terrible and hateful of police violence, even if they borrow the ""Director Luo Zhiguang"" In the 60-year-old middle-aged theory, the 60-year-old or older is not counted. The age of ten or younger may be only a young age, and there are four or five generations! However, my friends have reminded that the current method of planning is not the ""10-year generation"" but the ""three-year generation."" If so, the number will be even larger.
However, how to calculate the ""generation"", how many generations may not be the focus, because today, today, dissatisfied with the government, not shameful acts of violence, it is not only young people - do not see how many silver-haired people stand out, children Shouting at the scene, and those who screamed across the ocean. All of this, you can't see it, or choose not to see it.

So, please, please stop talking and say ""young people."" Because the so-called ""young people"" anti-government is actually just the step that you give yourself, to cover up the fact that men and women, old and young are not happy with you.
It is not an education issue, not a media issue, not a social media issue. The problem is that you have never faced up to the problem.
Note: Wu Shuqing's ""Hour Time"" visit: I have lost two generations of young people. I don't waste time talking to them (Ming Pao)
