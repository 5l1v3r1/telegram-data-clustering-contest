Now serving: Jollibee’s cheesy breakfast pies
05 Nov 2019, 01:18 by Coconuts Manila
What with traffic snarls and hours-long commutes, it can be tough for Manileños to have a sit-down breakfast. That’s why we say screw a sit-down breakfast! Stuff your pie-hole standing up, with Jollibee’s new offering: breakfast hand pies!

The hot, crispy pies come in two versions: Cheesy Corned Beef and Cheesy Bacon. Each come with their respective meats plopped into a glistening, deep-fried crust with cheese and mashed potato for a mere PHP49 each (less than US$1). And with all the fried dough, processed meat, and dairy fat that active bodies crave, they’re a healthy part of a balanced breakfast!**
The pies will be available starting today and until further notice in stores across Luzon. They’re available for dine-in, take-out, drive-through, or delivery.

Jollibee, of course, needs no introduction, having made its name with its famed crispy Chicken Joy, and its uniquely sweet, hotdog-topped Jollibee Spaghetti — two bona fide staples anywhere Filipinos are found.

FIND IT:


Jollibee is at Chinabank carpark, Valero cor. Villar St., Salcedo Village, Makati City (and other locations)

Open Monday – Sunday, 7am to 10pm
