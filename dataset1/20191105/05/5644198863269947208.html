      <p>Uber Technologies Inc on Monday beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue, as more people used its ride-hailing and Uber Eats restaurant delivery service.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Uber Technologies Inc on Monday missed Wall Street estimates for monthly active users for its ride-hailing platform, even as it posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue, sending shares down 5per cent in extended trading.</p>
      <p>The company's shares are expected to be under pressure on Wednesday, when a restriction on selling stock lifts. Some analysts expect more than 80per cent of the company's outstanding shares will become eligible for sale.</p>

      <p>Uber said its monthly active platform users rose to 103 million globally in the third quarter, from 82 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts' estimates of 105.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Total revenue rose nearly 30per cent to US$3.81 billion, beating estimates of US$3.69 billion.</p>
      <p>Uber's costs jumped about 33per cent to US$4.92 billion in the reported quarter. Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 29.4per cent from a year earlier to US$16.47 billion.</p>
      <p>The company and its smaller rival Lyft Inc , which are still making losses, have historically relied on heavy subsidies to attract riders. The companies are also spending to expand into newer areas.</p>
      <p>Lyft's results last week soothed some worries as the ride-hailing company posted better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and an improved outlook showed it was well on its way to profitability by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>Revenue from Uber's ride-hailing business rose about 19per cent to US$2.90 billion while sales from its Uber Eats segment rose 64per cent.</p>
      <p>Net loss attributable to the company widened to US$1.16 billion, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from US$986 million, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>On a per share basis, net loss attributable to the company's stockholders narrowed to 68 cents per share from US$2.21 per share.</p>
