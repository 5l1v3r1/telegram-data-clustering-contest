拒色與貪色的果報（2）

05 Nov 2019, 05:48

（接上文）
古語云「做事須循天理」、「欲廣福田，須憑心地」，指人做事要按天理而行；要使自己的福運廣大，就要修自己這顆心。古人認為，行善以積陰德為上，陰德又以護生及不淫為上。
《文昌帝君陰騭文》說：「貪好色慾、行為不正之人，污損了自己善良本性和名節，違逆了天理，是要受到懲罰的。上天常降禍給這樣的人，報應非常快。倘若有人不怕報應，對自己的邪行依然不加檢點改過，則此人隨時都會遭受災殃的降臨。蒼天的降福恩澤，只有潔身好德、守身如玉的人，才可能得此福報。」
自古以來，能戒色者必得福。而貪色縱慾、禍亂常道之事，足以傷陰德、削損犯者的前程，一有此心，雖未行其事，就已是罪過；實犯者，非僅己身必有災禍，且殃及子孫，由此而快速削減福祿者有之，由此而破家者有之，由此而奪命者有之，或是命中本該富貴尊榮，因而貧困潦倒終生；或是命中本是壽山福海，卻遭禍殃而夭亡。因一切逾矩敗節、悖逆天道的行為，都是天地所難容的，怎麼能不令人警惕戒備呢？古籍中記載的這類事例很多，以下舉幾個例子。

（二）勸善感神

明代嘉興府人李定，為人敦厚，平日抑惡揚善，但凡是聽見同學或親戚朋友談論違背操行的不正當之事，便嚴正地加以阻止和訓誡，為了使人明瞭妄論人是非、詆毀人名節、好談淫穢等事的過錯，寫了一篇《戒口孽文》規勸他人。他屢屢勸人多看善書，切莫無端造業，因此受他訓誨改過遷善的人很多。
有一年，他去參加科考，放榜前一夜，夢見他的先父告訴他說：「你前一生，少年考中進士，由於你恃才傲物，不知謙恭待人，上天罰你今生屢試不中，終生不發達。但此次有一個應試的人，註定今科該中解元，來年復可進士及第，只因好色貪淫，前月淫污了一個未出嫁的少女，功名已被削去。文昌帝君因你作《戒口孽文》，又勸勉他人看善書，認為你積累陰德很大，受你勸化戒邪淫及不敢再談淫穢事的人很多，故特奏上帝，補列你的功名，望你以後能更加勤勉修德，以報天恩。」他聽後，感到欣喜。放榜果然中了解元。
他作官後愈加謹慎，力行善事，後來以為官清正，官至御史。感應之機，如此之快！這種勸人改惡從善的慈悲之心，也足以感動天地使其福運增加，獲得善報。

Rejection and greed (2)

05 Nov 2019, 05:48

(continued above)
In the old saying, ""doing things through the heavens"" and ""shelving the Futian, you must rely on the heart"" means that people should do things according to the principles of heaven; to make their own good fortune, they must cultivate their own hearts. The ancients believed that doing good deeds was based on the accumulation of yin and morality.
""Wenchang Emperor Yin Yin Wen"" said: ""The people who are greedy and ill-willed, misbehaving, deface their own good nature and famous festivals, and violate the heavenly principles. They are to be punished. Heaven often causes disasters to such people, and the retribution is very If someone is not afraid of retribution, and still does not check the evils of their own, then this person will suffer the disaster at any time. The heavenly blessing of grace, only the person who is clean and good, and who keeps himself like jade, may get this blessing. .""
Since ancient times, people who can quit are blessed. The greed of indulgence and the harassment of the sinfulness is enough to hurt the yin and detract from the future of the offender. If there is such a heart, it is already a sin if it is not done; the actual offender must have a disaster, and he And the descendants, and thus the rapid reduction of the Phlox, and thus the home-breakers have it, and thus the death-seekers have it, or the life should be rich and honored, so that poverty will last for life; or hit this It was Shoushan Fuhai, but it was ruined and killed. Because all acts that are ruined and disobedient, and that are rebellious against heaven, are all difficult in heaven and earth. How can we not be alert? There are many such examples recorded in ancient books, to name a few.

(2) Advise God

Li Ding, a member of the Jiaxing government in the Ming Dynasty, was a man of great fortune, and he suppressed evils on the weekdays. But when he heard that his classmates or relatives and friends talked about the illegitimate things that were contrary to his conduct, he strictly prevented and exhorted him in order to make people understand the right and wrong. The fault of the famous people's festival, good talk about obscenity, etc., wrote an article ""Knocking the mouth"" to persuade others. He repeatedly advised people to read more good books, and did not make unreasonable careers. Therefore, many people have been changed by his exegesis.
One year, he went to the scientific examination and put it on the night before, and dreamed that his father told him: ""You used to be a scholar in your previous life. Because you are proud of you, you don't know how to be humble, and you will be punished in this life. Underdeveloped. But there is a person who is going to try this time. It is destined to solve the problem in this section. In the next year, he will be able to reinstate the scholar and the first. Only because of lascivious greed, the unmarried girl was defiled in the previous month. The fame has been cut. Emperor Wenchang is the author of ""King the mouth and swearing the text"", and also advises others to read good books. I think that you have accumulated a lot of yin, and you are a lot of people who are persuaded to refrain from sin and sin and do not dare to talk about obscenity. The fame of the fame, I hope that you will be more diligent in the future, to report the grace of heaven."" He was delighted after listening. I really understand the yuan in the list.
After he became an official, he became more cautious and did good deeds. Later he thought that the official was clear and the official was to the royal history. The machine of induction, so fast! This kind of compassion that persuades people to change evil and good is enough to move the heavens and the earth to increase their good fortune and obtain good news.
