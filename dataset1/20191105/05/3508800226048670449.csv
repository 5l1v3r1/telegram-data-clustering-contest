香港的抗戰，以及消失的景色
05 Nov 2019, 05:56 by 灰記客


我們想讓你知道的是中共／港府已經在香港進行沒有軍隊屠城的「六四」，警察已進行了無數次血腥鎮壓，製造一次又一次的人道災難，被打傷、各類型槍彈所傷的市民不計其數，祗是香港不是北京，暫時不能搞新聞封鎖、人人受審查過關那套，香港人的反抗也比他們的預期頑強。



警察暴力及濫權於11月2日和3日進入了一個「新高度」，明顯是要阻止市民大規模聚集，莫說上百萬人的示威、超過十萬人的遊行集會﹐在中共／港府／警察心目中，都要成為「絕響」。其中一個主因當然是「國際影響」：把香港的抗爭抽離國際社會的視野，讓外國以為香港逐漸「恢復秩序」，再好好「整治」反抗的香港人。
11月2日下午灰記和朋友由灣仔走到中環參與集會，沿途氣氛和以往很不一樣， 「防暴」警察不但一早出現，而且不是在遠處監視，而是實際在路上進行阻截（其實10月31日晚已經如此），以往大批市民可以遊行往目的地的情況不再。當大隊停留在灣仔、銅纙灣一帶，灰記跟著一些市民沿行人路繼續前進，遇到警察時，有市民忍不住高喊「黑警」、「皇軍」。聽到「皇軍」兩字，灰記不期然有家園被佔領的感覺，這些與市民互相對罵的武裝分子，真的是香港人嗎？
皇軍
在皇后大道東與金鐘道交界的行人路上，看到一對帶著口罩的長者夫婦，堅決違抗警察的「命令」，拒絕除下口罩而與黑布蒙面的警察激烈爭論。單看這個場面就知道「反蒙面法」是何等荒謬，何等擾民，武裝到牙齒，聲稱執行法律的警察，卻蒙著面、沒有警員編號、沒有配帶委任證，難以辨認，手無寸鐵的市民帶個口罩就被警察呼呼喝喝，像「暴徒」般看待。長者夫婦比較幸運，警察最終沒有堅持，他們亦獲放行。
在他們身旁的另一女子就倒霉得多，警察不但強行除去她的口罩，還向她的面部直射胡椒噴霧，令她痛苦不堪。警察的暴行隨即惹來包括灰記等的市民強烈不滿，大聲指摘警察「發神經」、「冇人性」、「離譜」……
然後又有數個蒙面警察追著灰記身旁的一對年輕男女，那兩名男女嚇得不斷後退，最令灰記憤怒的是警察拿著警棍作追打狀的同時，不斷高呼年輕男女襲警。這就是如今在街頭「橫行無忌」的警察的卑鄙和侷促，這也是他們為何不敢真面目示人的原因（除此之外，盛傳中共非法派來不少大陸武裝人員權充港警，當然最好不以真面目示人）。幸而年輕男女在包括灰記的市民「保護」下快步離開，沒有進一步受害。與此同時，警察已在遠處的灣仔軒尼詩道向人群發射催淚彈。

對比當日和周日警察的其他的血腥暴行，灰記目睹的屬「小兒科」，但也反映失控的警權已到了令人髪指的地步。
這兩天灰記和很多市民一樣，憤怒、憂心……兼而有之，除此之外，縈繞灰記心頭的還有「被佔領」這感覺。一個很久沒有記起的中學往事又重現腦海：當年灰記在一書店打暑假工，書店的司機很健談，經常想當年，講得最多的是「日本仔打香港」。灰記依稀記得司機說過日軍佔領時他是街童，派報紙維生。最記得他說日本兵對他好好，為何特別記得？因為灰記自小受家父國民黨民族主義「薰陶」，覺得八年抗戰是中國人的「民族驕傲」，日本侵華是萬惡之事，為何會有善良日本兵？這位當年街童也知道皇軍很兇惡殘暴，大人見到他們都很害怕，但小朋友如他則不用害怕，甚至不用敬禮。他說有一個日本兵對他特別好，會給他東西吃，鼓勵他讀書（更詳細的內容已記不起）。
這樣說不是真的要將現在香港的抗爭和艱苦的三年零八個月或八年抗戰相比，但皇軍也善待小朋友卻是對現今港警的當頭捧喝，港警連中、小學生也不放過濫權施暴，年輕人的生命在他們心中如曱甴般下賤，港警真的連日本皇軍也不如，這也是為何有市民高喊港警為皇軍，對他們極痛恨的根本原因。當然市民絕不會忘記這些「皇軍」背後的政治勢力。
消失的景色
說到「被佔領」，灰記也想起2009年在此博客寫過的一篇文章，名為〈景色〉，是講一本巴勒斯坦人Raja Shehadeh所寫、描述被以色列佔領故土所思所感的書，英文書名為 《Palestinian Walks: Notes on a Vanishing Landscape》。當時寫此文章是為了紀念被政府強行摧毀的菜園村以及村民曾作出的抗爭，菜園村作為vanishing landscape，是香港被消失的重要人文歷史。而書本所指的vanishing landscape，不但是因為以色列大量興建殖民區令風景不再，也因為自由的消失令風光不再：
「佔領的早年，直至八十年代初，Raja還可以自由遠足，之後，他的行徑越來越受限制，一些以往可到達的地方被禁止前往；隨時被以色列士兵查問身分，阻止前進。有一次，他到杰理科渡假一天，回程時要苦苦哀求以色列士兵讓他回到突然宵禁的拉姆安拉。他感嘆生活的艱難，讓人沮喪的民族前途，無時無刻的屈辱和挫折，曾經想過到外國輕鬆地生活。」（摘自〈景色〉一文）
此刻灰記重提此書，能引起的聯想可能更大，因為被市民形容為皇軍的港警的「無法無天」成為日常的話，莫說要示威遊行，市民即使逛街、逛商場，甚至在自己居住地方——香港的日常景色——附近蹓躂，都可能被盤查、威嚇甚至拘捕。相信很多香港人，特別是較年長者，都會有Raja的感受，「回歸」早期還可以自由自在，之後越來越多限制，特別近年尤其今年，一些以往可享有的自由都被禁止。 不少人感嘆生活艱難，讓人沮喪的香港人前途，無時無刻的屈辱和挫折……

不但如此，香港人被許下的自治（真正的自治必然包括民主選舉，即真普選）權利，巴勒斯坦人不也曾被許下立國權利，如今一切變形走樣，香港人不但真普選遙遙無期，自治空間亦不斷被中共政權蠶食，正如巴勒斯坦人不但立國遙遙無期，自治空間亦被以色列佔領軍／殖民者不斷蠶食一樣，管它「回歸」還是「被佔領」。
把香港和巴勒斯坦比較的確令人沮喪，因為以色列佔領下，巴勒斯坦不斷爆發人道災難。而中共四中全會發放的「治港」訊息是以「國家安全」為名，進一步剝奪香港人的權利和自由，以達到所謂「直接管治」，完全視《中英聯合聲明》和「一國兩制」如無物，亦即是說，現在港警橫行的狀態會持續，或以其他形式維持這種威懾管治，以好好「整治」反抗的香港人，難免繼續出現人道災難。
沒有軍隊的屠城
或者應該說，中共／港府實際上已經在香港進行沒有軍隊屠城的「六四」，警察已進行了無數次血腥鎮壓，製造一次又一次的人道災難，被打傷、各類型槍彈所傷的市民不計其數（特別是警方無差別的向市民瘋狂發射催淚彈，其實是用化學武器攻擊市民，近日所用的懷疑國產催淚彈可能毒性更強，有人被射中後因彈殻著火而嚴重燒傷，嚴重的話可致命），祗是香港不是北京，暫時不能搞新聞封鎖、人人受審查過關那套，香港人的反抗也比他們的預期頑強。中共／港府的策略可能會因應情況有所不同，例如偶而會吹一些「軟風」，不外放出林鄭會下台（其實who cares）、明年可能成立「獨立調查委員會」、整頓警隊之類的消息，但戰略是以各種各樣的方式牢牢掌控香港，暴力鎮壓則是其中一個必要選項，事實上，中共／港府正向香港的反抗者宣戰。
香港人的抗戰形勢的確不妙，但留下的人還有其他選擇嗎？正如《Palestinian Walks》一書提到農夫Sabri Gharib的抗戰，他是第一個敢於挺身作證，講出鄰近的猶太殖民騷擾的事實，包括被阻止到原來屬於自己的耕地耕作，自己和子女被開槍射擊，被恐嚇以及被以色列軍方無數次抓捕。二十多年來他與以色列當局對抗（此書於2007年出版），作者Raja和其他律師，則利用法律途徑，協助如他一樣的巴勒斯坦人的「徒勞」抗戰。
是的，在龧光初露（灰記始終認為這道曙光一定是和中國國內抗爭取得進展有關）之前，所有反抗都是「徒勞」， 但沒有「徒勞」的反抗就不成抗戰。11月2日和3日香港人依然在頑強地、團結地、「徒勞」地反抗，現在趁香港人的反抗還未被完全鎮壓下去，大家仍然可以，仍然必要以各種力所能及的方式，在各層面反抗，顯示港人爭取應得的自治的決心，並做好漫長抗戰的心理準備。

Hong Kong's war of resistance, and the disappearing scenery
05 Nov 2019, 05:56 by Gray


What we want you to know is that the CCP/Hong Kong Government has already carried out the ""June 4th"" without military slaughter in Hong Kong. The police have carried out countless bloody suppressions, creating humanitarian disasters again and again, being wounded and wounded by various types of bullets. There are countless people, so Hong Kong is not Beijing. For the time being, it is impossible to engage in news blockades and everyone is subject to censorship. The resistance of Hong Kong people is also tenacious than their expectations.



Police violence and abuse of power entered a ""new height"" on November 2 and 3, obviously to prevent the masses from gathering on a large scale, not to mention the demonstrations of millions of people, the parade gatherings of more than 100,000 people, in the CCP/ In the eyes of the Hong Kong Government/Police, we must all become ""outstanding"". One of the main reasons is of course ""international influence"": to take Hong Kong's resistance away from the international community's vision and let foreign countries think that Hong Kong is gradually ""restoring the order"" and then ""remediate"" the rebellious Hong Kong people.
On the afternoon of November 2, Gray and friends walked from Wanchai to Central to participate in the rally. The atmosphere along the way was very different from the past. The ""anti-riot"" police not only appeared early in the morning, but also did not monitor in the distance, but actually intercepted on the road (actually 10 This has been the case on the evening of the 31st of the month. In the past, a large number of citizens were able to march to their destinations. When the brigade stayed in Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, the ash kept following some people along the footpath. When the police encountered the police, some people could not help but shout ""Black Police"" and ""King of the Army"". When I heard the word ""emperor army"", I remembered the feeling that my homeland was occupied. Is it true that the armed elements who confront each other are really Hong Kong people?
Imperial army
On the pedestrian road at the junction of Queen's Road East and Queensway, I saw a couple of elders with masks resolutely disobeying the police's ""command"" and refused to remove the mask and argued fiercely with the black-faced police. Just look at this scene and know how ridiculous the ""anti-masking method"" is, how to disturb the people, armed to the teeth, the police who claimed to enforce the law, but faceless, no policeman number, no appointment certificate, illegible, unarmed The public took a mask and was greeted by the police and treated like a ""thug"". The elderly couple were more fortunate. The police did not insist on it and they were released.
The other woman beside them was much more unlucky. The police not only forcibly removed her mask, but also sprayed pepper spray directly onto her face, which made her suffer. The atrocities of the police immediately provoked strong dissatisfaction among the people including Gray, and accused the police of ""sudden nerves"", ""derogatory"" and ""outrageous""...
Then there were a number of masked police officers chasing a pair of young men and women next to Gray. The two men and women were scared and constantly retreating. The most angry thing was that the police were holding the batons for chasing, and they kept screaming young. Men and women attacked the police. This is the despicable and cramped policeman who is now on the streets. This is why they don’t dare to show their faces. In addition, it is rumored that the CCP has illegally sent many mainland armed personnel to fill the police. Do not show people in the true face). Fortunately, young men and women quickly left under the ""protection"" of the citizens including Gray, and there was no further victimization. At the same time, the police have fired tear gas at the Hennessy Road in Wan Chai.

Comparing the other bloody atrocities of the police on the same day and Sunday, the gray-speaking is a ""pediatrics"", but it also reflects that the out-of-control police power has reached an alarming level.
In the past two days, Gray is like many people, angry, worried... and in addition to this, the feeling of ""occupied"" is lingering. A long-term school that has not been remembered for a long time has regained its mind: when the gray book was used in a bookstore for summer vacation, the driver of the bookstore was very talkative. I often thought that the year was the most popular one. Gray remembered vaguely that the driver said that he was a street boy when he was occupied by the Japanese army and sent a newspaper to survive. Most remember that he said that the Japanese soldiers are good to him, why do you especially remember? Because Ash has been ""loved"" by his nationalist Kuomintang nationalism, he feels that the eight-year war of resistance is the ""national pride"" of the Chinese. The Japanese invasion of China is a matter of evil. Why are there good Japanese soldiers? The street boy also knew that the imperial army was very ferocious and brutal. When adults saw them, they were very scared, but the children did not need to be afraid, even without salute. He said that there is a Japanese soldier who is especially good to him. He will give him something to eat and encourage him to study (more detailed content can not be remembered).
This is not really a comparison between the current struggle in Hong Kong and the arduous three-year, eight- or eight-year war of resistance. However, the imperial army is also kind to the children of the Hong Kong police. The Hong Kong police have not let go of the primary and secondary school students. The abuse of power and violence, the lives of young people are ashamed in their hearts, and the Hong Kong police are not as good as the Japanese Imperial Army. This is why the public has shouted the Hong Kong police as the Imperial Army and they hate them very much. Of course, the public will never forget the political forces behind these ""emperor forces.""
Disappearing view
When it comes to ""occupied"", Gray remembers an article written on this blog in 2009, called ""Scenery"", which is a book written by the Palestinian Raja Shehadeh and described by the Israeli occupation of the homeland. The English book is called ""Palestinian Walks: Notes on a Vanishing Landscape."" At the time, this article was written to commemorate the vegetable gardens that had been forcibly destroyed by the government and the resistance that the villagers had made. As a vanishing landscape, Caiyuan Village is an important human history in which Hong Kong has disappeared. The vanishing landscape referred to in the book is not only because Israel has built a large number of colonial areas, but the scenery is no longer, and because the disappearance of freedom makes the scenery no longer:
""In the early years of the occupation, until the early 1980s, Raja was free to hike. After that, his behavior was increasingly restricted. Some places that were previously reachable were forbidden to go; he was always questioned by Israeli soldiers and prevented from advancing. Once He went to Jerico for a day of vacation. When he returned, he pleaded with Israeli soldiers to return him to Ramallah, who suddenly had a curfew. He lamented the hardships of life, the frustrating national future, the humiliation and frustrations all the time, once thought Living easily in a foreign country."" (Excerpt from ""Scenery"")
At this moment, the re-introduction of this book, the association that can be caused may be even bigger, because the ""lawlessness"" of the Hong Kong police, described by the public as the imperial army, has become a daily routine. It is said that the demonstrations will be carried out. Even if people go shopping, go shopping, or even live in their own places. - The daily scenery of Hong Kong - nearby, may be investigated, threatened or even arrested. I believe that many Hong Kong people, especially the older ones, will feel Raja's feelings. In the early days of ""return"", they will be free and more restrictive. In recent years, especially this year, some freedoms that were previously enjoyed are prohibited. Many people lament the hardships of life, the frustrating future of Hong Kong people, humiliation and frustration all the time...

Not only that, the right of Hong Kong people to be allowed to self-government (true autonomy must include democratic elections, that is, universal suffrage), the Palestinians have not been allowed to establish the right to establish a country, and now everything is deformed, Hong Kong people are not only universally elected, but also for a long time. Space has also been eroded by the Chinese Communist regime. Just as the Palestinians have not only established their country for a long time, but also the autonomous space has been eroded by the Israeli occupying forces/colonists, whether it is ""returned"" or ""occupied.""
Comparing Hong Kong and Palestine is indeed frustrating because of the humanitarian disaster in Palestine under Israeli occupation. The ""Hong Kong"" message issued by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party is in the name of ""national security"". It further deprives Hong Kong people of their rights and freedoms to achieve the so-called ""direct governance"". It fully regards the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy. If there is nothing, that is to say, the current state of the Hong Kong police will continue, or the maintenance of such deterrence and governance in other forms, in order to ""remediate"" the rebellious Hong Kong people, it is inevitable that there will continue to be a humanitarian disaster.
Butcher without army
Or it should be said that the CCP/Hong Kong Government has actually carried out the ""June 4th"" without military slaughter in Hong Kong. The police have carried out countless bloody suppressions, creating humanitarian disasters again and again, being wounded and wounded by various types of bullets. There are countless people (especially the police indiscriminately launching tear gas bombs to the public indiscriminately. In fact, they use chemical weapons to attack the public. The suspected domestic tear gas bombs used in recent days may be more toxic. Some people are severely burned after being shot because of the shell fire. If it is fatal, then Hong Kong is not Beijing. For the time being, it is impossible to engage in news blockades and everyone is subject to censorship. The resistance of Hong Kong people is also tenacious than their expectations. The CCP/Hong Kong government's strategy may vary depending on the situation. For example, it will occasionally blow some ""soft winds"", but Lin Zheng will step down (in fact, who cares), next year may establish an ""independent investigation committee"", and reorganize the police force. News, but the strategy is to control Hong Kong in a variety of ways. Violent repression is one of the necessary options. In fact, the CCP/Hong Kong government is declaring war on Hong Kong's rebels.
The situation of the Hong Kong people’s war of resistance is not good, but are there other options for the people left behind? As the book ""Palestinian Walks"" mentions the war of the farmer Sabri Gharib, he was the first to dare to testify and tell the story of the neighboring Jewish colonial harassment, including being prevented from farming in his own arable land, and his children and children were opened. The gun was shot, intimidated and arrested numerous times by the Israeli military. For more than two decades he has fought against the Israeli authorities (this book was published in 2007), and author Raja and other lawyers have used legal channels to assist the Palestinians in his ""futility"" war.
Yes, before the dawn of the dawn (the ash always believes that this dawn must be related to the progress of China's domestic struggle), all resistance is ""in vain"", but no resistance in vain will not become a war of resistance. On November 2nd and 3rd, Hong Kong people still resisted stubbornly, unitedly and in vain. Now the resistance of Hong Kong people has not been completely suppressed. Everyone can still, and it is still necessary to do everything in their power. Rebellion at the level shows the determination of the people of Hong Kong to strive for the autonomy they deserve and to prepare for the long war of resistance.
