國人申請中國護照　外交部：依法辦理「註銷台灣護照」
05 Nov 2019, 05:19 by 謝文哲, 攝影組
中國國台辦昨（4日）公布「26條惠台措施」，其中第14條提到台胞可赴中國駐外使領館求助或申請旅行文件。對此，外交部今（5日）表示不符合中華民國法律，且可能有成為政治範例的風險。
根據《自由時報》與《中廣》報導，外交部發言人歐江安今在例會上表示，中華民國護照好用度排名為全球前30名，中國護照則排行七十幾名，而國人享有的免簽、落地簽和電子簽證等有168國，「待遇遠遠超過中國」。
歐江安也強調，外交部海外有代表處與辦事處109個，也有緊急聯絡和24小時急難救助，能夠提供有效親切快速的服務，「我們當然不需要中國」。
此外，歐江安提醒，國人若找中國使領館可能會被記錄拍照，或被當成「台灣人民支持兩岸統一、一國兩制」，後續造成的效應不可不慎。歐江安重申，護照是所有人唯一有效的國際身份文件，旅外只會認可這本，若國人向中國申辦旅行文件，會產生適法性問題，因而牴觸護照法規，將依現行法規辦理。
根據「兩岸人民關係條例」第9-1條與「護照條例」第25條相關規定，國人若申辦中國護照，將喪失台灣公民權利與戶籍，護照也會被註銷。不過，如果註銷中國戶籍或放棄持有中國護照，可向內政部申請恢復台灣人民身分，得以返台定居。

05 Nov 2019, 05:19 by Xie Wenzhe, Photography Group
The Taiwan Affairs Office of China announced yesterday (the 4th measures for Huitai), in which Article 14 mentioned that Taiwan compatriots can go to Chinese embassies and consulates for help or apply for travel documents. In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today (5th) said that it does not comply with the laws of the Republic of China, and may have the risk of becoming a political paradigm.
According to the ""Free Times"" and ""Zhongguang"", Foreign Ministry spokesman Ou Jiangan said at the regular meeting that the Republic of China passport is ranked in the top 30 in the world, and the Chinese passport is ranked in the top 30, while the Chinese people enjoy the exemption. There are 168 countries in signing, landing visas and e-visa, and ""the treatment far exceeds China.""
Ou Jiangan also stressed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 109 representative offices and offices overseas. It also has emergency liaison and 24-hour emergency assistance. It can provide effective and friendly and fast service. ""Of course we do not need China.""
In addition, Ou Jiangan reminded that if Chinese people find Chinese embassies and consulates, they may be photographed or regarded as ""the Taiwanese people support cross-strait reunification, one country, two systems"", and the subsequent effects cannot be inadvertent. Ou Jiangan reiterated that the passport is the only valid international identity document for all. The traveler will only recognize this book. If the Chinese apply for travel documents to China, it will have legal problems. Therefore, the passport regulations will be handled in accordance with the current regulations.
According to Article 9-1 of the ""People's Relations Ordinance"" and Article 25 of the ""Passports Ordinance"", if a Chinese person applies for a Chinese passport, it will lose Taiwan citizenship and household registration, and the passport will be cancelled. However, if you cancel your Chinese household registration or give up your Chinese passport, you can apply to the Ministry of the Interior to restore the status of the Taiwanese people and be able to return to Taiwan to settle down.
