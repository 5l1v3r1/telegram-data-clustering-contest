      <p>REUTERS: China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September ahead of the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal, Politico reported on Monday, citing three people familiar with internal discussions.</p>
      <p>Beijing is pressing the U.S. to remove a 15per cent tariff that was imposed on roughly US$112 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 1, but no decision has been made, Politico reported citing sources.</p>

      <p>The Financial Times newspaper later on Monday also said the White House is considering whether to roll back levies on US$112 billion of Chinese imports including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors, which were introduced at a 15per cent rate on Sept. 1.</p>
      <p>Trump had said on Friday evening that negotiations about a "phase one" agreement were going well and he hoped to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a U.S. location when work on the agreement was completed.</p>
      <p>U.S. and Chinese negotiators have been racing to finalize the text of a "phase one" agreement for Trump and Xi to sign this month, a process clouded by wrangling over U.S. demands for a timetable of Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products.</p>
