唐代使者漂流到巨人國

05 Nov 2019, 05:57

到底有沒有巨人呢？唐代出使的官員有多次漂流到巨人國的傳說記載。唐代時，今朝鮮半島上是有新羅國，和高句麗、百濟成三國鼎立的局面。新羅佔領半島東部，其東南面跟日本國隔海對望，古籍記載其東面有巨人國。
巨人身高二、三丈，甚至更高，牙齒像鋸子，指甲像鉤子，不用火燒烤東西吃，抓到禽獸就生吃了，有時候也吃人。他們的身體裸露出一層黑毛，有的也穿衣服。新羅東邊的巨人國周圍有相連數千里的山脈圍繞著，有一山口，用鐵門擋住，稱為鐵關，常派數千弓弩手守著，防衛森嚴。
晚唐時，有位漂流到巨人國的大使是六軍使西門思恭[1]。奉命出使新羅的西門思恭，遇到異常的風向、水流，漂浮在大海上有一個月之久，完全失去了航路方向，不知道身在何處。
忽然有一天，船在南邊的一處海岸著陸，遠看陸上也有田地，像是有人生活的模樣，西門思恭便爬上了陸地，四下眺望。不一會兒，看到一個很高大的人，身高有五六丈的巨人來了。他的衣襟很奇特，聲音像打雷，他俯視西門思恭，有點像驚訝、讚歎似的。然後，他就用五個手指撮著西門思恭走了一百多里，進入到一個岩洞裡面。
只見他們年老的、年幼的都聚在那裡面，一個傳一個地把他們的人都招呼過來，爭先恐後地來觀看西門思恭。他們的話西門一點也聽不懂，但他們都顯露出很高興的樣子，好像得到一種奇異的東西。於是挖了一個坑，把西門思恭放在裡面，派人看守著。
在坑裡過了二夜，西門思恭就攀爬而上，爬出了坑，摸到原路逃了回去。
西門思恭才跳上船，那巨人已追到船邊，並且用大手抓住了船舷，不讓他走。在這危急情況下，西門思恭揮劍砍斷了巨人的三個手指頭，那手指頭比現在搥帛的棒子還粗，巨人驟然失掉了三個手指頭，痛得不得了，只好退了回去。
終於，西門思恭解開纜繩開船了。但是，船上的水和糧食一點也沒剩了，他一個月沒糧食吃，就吃身上穿的衣服，最後終於回了國門。西門思恭獻上了那三根巨人的手指頭，這三根手指被上了漆收藏在皇宮的倉庫裡。後來西門思恭被提升做了主軍，從那時起，他寧可把金玉送給人也不舉行宴飲，平生也一直不用飲食招待客人，因為那總是會讓他想起沒有糧食吃的艱難日子。
還有一件類似的事情，發生在天寶初年。唐朝派贊善大夫魏曜出使新羅國，策立他們年幼的太子當國王。當時魏曜年紀大了，對出使這件事有些畏懼。有位客人曾到過新羅，於是魏曜就去訪問他了解情況。
客人說：「高宗永徽年間（公元650—655年），唐朝和新羅國、日本國都有友好往來，派使者出使時兼使兩國。有使者到達新羅以後，又將渡海去日本國，不料在海中遇到了大風，波浪滔天，好幾隻船在海上漂流數十日。
天地蒼蒼茫茫，海域一望無際，完全失去了方向。忽然風停波靜，好不容易船隻著了海岸，誰也不知道到了什麼地方。當時有幾隻船漂流到這岸邊。那時正是傍晚時分，夕陽就要落山。大家先把船拴好，就往海岸上攀登，大約有一百多人的樣子。海岸高二三十丈，登上去後，遠遠地看到了屋子，大夥兒都爭先恐後地跑過去。
有些很高大的人走過來了，身高有二、三丈長。看見這些漂流的人到來，他們顯出非常高興的樣子，可是講的什麼話唐人聽不懂。巨人前呼後擁地讓來人進入屋子，然後就用石頭堵上了門，就都出去了。
不一會兒他們的人又來了，這次來了百多人。他們挑選了唐人中身體肥胖有肉的，共挑了五十多人。這些被挑的人都被他們煮熟了，然後拿出好酒，聚在一起宴飲取樂。
喝到深夜，這些巨人都醉酒了。於是剩下的那些人就悄悄走出屋子到其他院子裡看看。在後院裡發現有三十位唐朝婦女，都是先後被風颳到此地而被擄掠拘留的。她們自己說：「男的全被吃了，只留下婦女，讓我們給他們做衣服。你們現在趁著他們喝醉了，為什麼還不逃走呢？請讓我們給你們帶路。」
大家一聽都很高興。婦女們取出她們的幾百匹潔白的絲絹扛在身上，然後拿來刀子，把喝醉的那些巨人的腦袋都砍了下來。他們一夥跟著婦人們逃到海岸邊上，只見岸很高，天很黑沒法下去。婦人們的長絲絹白練就在這時派上用場，大家綁好絲絹，利用長長的絲絹墜降到海邊去。到了水邊找到了船，大夥兒都上了船。等到天方破曉，就出發了。
這時忽聽到山頭上傳來叫喊聲，已有一千多個巨人追來了，一個個追下了山，須臾就到了海岸。這時船已經駛離岸邊。
巨人到了，沒能趕上船，又咆哮又蹦跳，氣得像發怒猛吼的猛虎一般。客人說，這些使者和那些婦女最後都回到了家。
這裡取了二則古人遭遇巨人國的故事，可以看到巨人的傳說從古來就有。地球上還有許多科學解不開的人類之謎。
註釋
[1]：西門思恭曾經受友人桂管觀察使鄭亞之托，照顧他的兒子鄭畋（公元825年－883年）。西門思恭當神策軍中尉時，鄭亞已經死了，西門思恭便派人將鄭畋帶回來撫養，待他如同自己的甥侄，並且請老師教導他。鄭畋長大後官拜將相，時正值黃巢侵入長安，鄭畋組織軍隊抗擊黃巢軍，西門思恭當時逃難到終南山。鄭畋以家財重金召募勇猛的人去尋訪西門思恭，找到他奉養在家中，無微不至地侍奉他，如同對待自己的父親一樣。最後，西門思恭終老在鄭畋家中。

The messengers of the Tang Dynasty drifted to the Giant Kingdom

05 Nov 2019, 05:57

Is there a giant in the end? Officials who were sent to the Tang Dynasty had many legends that drifted to the giant country. During the Tang Dynasty, there were new Silla countries on the Korean peninsula, and the situation of Goguryeo and Baekje Cheng. Silla occupied the eastern part of the peninsula, and its southeast side is facing the sea across the country. The ancient books record that there is a giant country on the east side.
The height of the giant is two or three feet, even higher. The teeth are like saws, nails are like hooks, and there is no need to eat barbecue food. When they catch the animals, they eat raw food and sometimes eat people. Their bodies have a layer of black hair and some wear clothes. Around the giant country on the east side of Silla, there are thousands of miles of mountains surrounded by a mountain pass, blocked by iron gates, called the iron gate, often sent thousands of bows to guard, strict defense.
In the late Tang Dynasty, an ambassador who drifted to the Giants' State was the Sixth Army's ambassador Ximen Sigong [1]. Ximen Sigong, who was ordered to send out Silla, encountered unusual winds and currents and floated on the sea for a month. He completely lost the direction of the route and did not know where he was.
Suddenly one day, the ship landed on a coast in the south, and there was a field on the land. As if it were a human life, Simon Sigong climbed onto the land and looked around. In a short while, I saw a tall man, a giant with five or six feet tall. His clothes are very strange, his voice is like thunder, and he looks down at Simon Sigong, a bit like surprise and admiration. Then, he took five fingers and took Ximen Sigong for more than a hundred miles and entered a cave.
I saw that they were old and young, and they all gathered there, and they all greeted their people one by one, and rushed to watch Ximen Sigong. They couldn’t understand Simon at all, but they all showed a very happy look, as if they had a strange thing. So he dug a pit, put Ximen Sigong inside, and sent people to guard.
After spending two nights in the pit, Ximen Sigong climbed up and climbed out of the pit and touched the original road to escape.
Ximen Si Gong jumped onto the boat, and the giant had chased the side of the boat and grabbed the ship's side with a big hand and prevented him from leaving. In this critical situation, Ximen Sigong cut the three fingers of the giant, and the fingers were thicker than the current sticks. The giant suddenly lost three fingers and was so painful that he had to retreat. go back.
Finally, Ximensi Gong untied the cable and sailed. However, there was no water left on the boat. He had no food to eat for a month, he ate the clothes he wore, and finally returned to the country. Simmons offered the fingers of the three giants, and the three fingers were painted in the warehouse of the palace. Later, Ximen Sigong was promoted to become the main army. Since then, he would rather give Jinyu to people than to have a feast. He has never used food to entertain guests, because it always reminds him of the difficulty of eating without food. day.
There is another similar thing that happened in the early years of Tianbao. The Tang Dynasty sent a good doctor, Wei Wei, to the Xinluo State, and set up their young prince to be the king. At that time, Wei Wei was very old and he was a little afraid of this. A guest has been to Silla, so Wei Wei went to visit him to understand the situation.
The guest said: ""In the Gaozong Yonghui period (650-655 AD), the Tang Dynasty and the Silla Kingdom and the Japanese countries had friendly exchanges, and the emissaries sent the emissaries to the two countries. After the messengers arrived in Silla, they would cross the sea to Japan. Unexpectedly, there was a strong wind in the sea, waves and sky, and several ships drifted on the sea for dozens of days.
The sky is vast and the sea is endless, completely losing its direction. Suddenly the wind stopped and the boat was on the coast. No one knew where it was. At that time, several ships drifted to the shore. It was in the evening when the sun set. Everyone first took the boat and climbed the coast. There were about a hundred people. The coast was two or thirty feet high. After boarding it, I saw the house from afar. Everyone rushed to run.
Some tall people have come over and are two or three feet tall. When they saw the arrival of these drifters, they showed a very happy look, but what the Tang people could not understand. The giants rushed to let the people enter the house, and then they blocked the door with stones, and they all went out.
In a short while their people came again, this time more than a hundred people came. They selected the Tang people who were obese and fleshy, and picked more than 50 people. These picked people were cooked by them, and then they took out the good wine and gathered for a feast.
After drinking late at night, these giants are drunk. Then the rest of the people quietly walked out of the house to look at other yards. In the backyard, 30 women from the Tang Dynasty were found to have been detained and detained by the wind. They said, ""The men are all eaten, leaving only women, let us make clothes for them. You are now drunk with them, why not escape? Please let us lead you.""
Everyone was very happy to hear it. The women took out their hundreds of white silks and put them on their knives, and cut down the heads of the drunk giants. A group of them fled to the coast with the women, only to see the shore is very high, the sky is very dark and can't go down. The women’s filaments and whites were used at this time. Everyone tied the silkworms and used a long silk to fall to the beach. When I got to the water, I found the boat, and everyone got on the boat. When the day is dawning, I set off.
At this time, I heard the shouts coming from the hills. More than a thousand giants have chased them. They have chased down the mountains one by one, and they have to go to the coast. At this time the ship has already left the shore.
When the giant arrived, he couldn’t catch the boat, roaring and jumping, and he was as angry as a fierce tiger. The guest said that these messengers and those women finally returned home.
Here are two stories of the ancients encountering the giant country. It can be seen that the legend of the giant has existed since ancient times. There are many mysteries of humanity that cannot be solved by science.
Comment
[1]: Ximen Sigong was once observed by the friend Gui Guan to take care of his son Zheng Zheng (AD 825-883). When Ximen Sigong was the god of the army, Zheng Ya was already dead. Ximen Sigong sent someone to bring him back to raise him. He treated him like his own, and asked the teacher to teach him. Zheng Zheng grew up and later worshipped, when Huang Chao invaded Chang'an, Zheng Zheng organized the army to fight against Huang Chaojun, and Ximen Sigong fled to the end of Nanshan. Zheng Hao recruited a brave man to find Ximen Sigong with his family's wealth, and found him to be at home, serving him in every possible way, just like his father. In the end, Ximen Sigong is always in Zheng Jia's home.
