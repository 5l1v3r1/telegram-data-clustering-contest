      <h1>Turkey captures Baghdadi's sister in Syria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T05:21:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 05:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>Turkey captured the sister of dead militant Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Monday in the northern Syrian town of Azaz, a senior Turkish official told <i>Reuters</i>, and is interrogating her husband and daughter-in-law who were also detained.</p>
      <p>Rasmiya Awad, 65, was detained in a raid near Azaz, the official said, referring to a Turkish-controlled Syrian town near the border. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children.</p>
      <p>“We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of ISIS,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Little independent information is available on Baghdadi’s sister and <i>Reuters</i> was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi killed himself last month when cornered in a tunnel during a raid by US special forces in northwestern Syria. Islamic State, in an audiotape posted online on Thursday, confirmed that its leader had died and vowed revenge against the United States.</p>

      <p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s communications director said the woman’s capture was evidence of Turkey’s determination to fight against Islamic State.</p>
      <p>“The arrest of al-Baghdadi’s sister is yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations,” Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter early on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh,” he wrote, using another name for Islamic State.</p>
      <p>“Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned.”</p>

      <p>Baghdadi had risen from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself “caliph” of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and Syria from 2014-2017 before Islamic State’s control was wrested away by US-led coalition forces including Iraqis and Syrian Kurds.</p>
      <p>The group, also known as ISIS, said a successor to Baghdadi identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi had been appointed. A senior US official last week said Washington was looking at the new leader to determine where he came from.</p>
      <p>World leaders welcomed his death, but they and security experts warned that the group, which carried out atrocities against religious minorities and horrified most Muslims, remained a security threat in Syria and beyond.</p>
