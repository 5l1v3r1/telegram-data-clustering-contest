The host said the Democratic Party's shift to the left is ""backfiring.""
""The Democrats have gone in the direction I predicted, and it is slowly but surely backfiring on them,"" Ingraham said.  ""Never Trumpers, liberals, they're forever accusing us Republicans of selling our soul to Trump. How many times you read read that tired old line that's blatantly false.""
""The woman who sold her soul is the woman with the gavel,"" Ingraham said, showing an image of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Ingraham said Pelosi and Democrats have no accomplishments and that impeachment hasn't benefited Americans.
