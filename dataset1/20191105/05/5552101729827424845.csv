韓國男團A-Jax出身的導慪（舊名亨坤）4月底在社群網站貼出婚紗照，宣布邁入「第二人生」，近日他突然PO出一張手抱嬰兒的照片，寫下「感謝妻子」「我可愛的兒子」，嚇壞不少粉絲。
A-Jax於2012年出道，頂著SS501、KARA師弟光環闖蕩歌壇，演藝事業卻始終不上不下，3年前歷經成員變動後，從7人改為5人制展開活動。今年3月底他們所屬的DSP娛樂宣布成員約滿，團體正式解散，1個月後30歲的隊長導慪也在IG閃電公開婚訊，並在5月中與圈外女友舉行婚禮，如今隨著寶貝兒子誕生，也讓粉絲恍然大悟「原來是雙喜臨門」！

3日導慪在社群網站曬出寶寶的萌照，留言：「換尿布、餵奶粉、打嗝，還有一段很長的路要走的爸爸。」網友看到父子同框的照片後也紛紛獻上祝福，「長得和爸爸好像」「結婚、寶寶出生，進度好快啊」，恭喜導慪除了「人夫」外又多了個新身分。

The male star bursts into the sun, and the baby is married.

The Korean men’s team A-Jax’s guide (the old name Hengkun) posted a wedding photo on the social networking site at the end of April, announcing the move into “Second Life”. Recently, he suddenly took out a picture of a baby holding a hand and wrote ""Thank you for your wife,"" ""My lovely son,"" scared many fans.
A-Jax debuted in 2012. With the SS501 and KARA's younger brothers, the performing arts career has never been able to keep up. After three years of changes in membership, the event was changed from 7 to 5 people. At the end of March this year, their DSP entertainment announced that their members had expired and the group was officially dissolved. One month later, the 30-year-old captain was also open to the IG Lightning, and in mid-May, he was married with his girlfriend outside the circle. The birth of the baby son also made the fans suddenly realize that ""it was a double happiness""!

On the 3rd, I guided the baby's photo on the social networking site and left a message: ""Change diapers, milk powder, snoring, and a long way to go."" The netizens saw the photos of the father and son in the same box. Blessings, ""Looking like Dad"" ""Married, baby born, progress is fast"", congratulations to the introduction of a new identity in addition to ""the husband"".
