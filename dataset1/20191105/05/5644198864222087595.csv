The Financial Times newspaper later on Monday also said the White House is considering whether to roll back levies on US$112 billion of Chinese imports including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors, which were introduced at a 15per cent rate on Sept. 1.
Trump had said on Friday evening that negotiations about a ""phase one"" agreement were going well and he hoped to sign the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a U.S. location when work on the agreement was completed.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators have been racing to finalize the text of a ""phase one"" agreement for Trump and Xi to sign this month, a process clouded by wrangling over U.S. demands for a timetable of Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products.
