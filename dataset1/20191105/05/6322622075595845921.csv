Reuters reported that Asian stock markets were close to the July high on Tuesday, as there are signs that the trade war between the United States and China is approaching the truce, and the market is optimistic that the US economy will achieve steady growth driven by consumption.
MSCI's Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) index edged up 0.1%, hitting a four-month high on the previous day.
Affin Huang’s Capital Research pointed out that the KLCI, which has been below 1600 points in the past two months, rebounded yesterday and rose above the threshold.
""The current technical rebound is still in progress. This can be seen from some indicators on the daily chart, and the bullish momentum is still strong.""
The research institute expects that the KLCI will re-explore the 1615 level in the near future and said it is rebounding after technical suppression.
