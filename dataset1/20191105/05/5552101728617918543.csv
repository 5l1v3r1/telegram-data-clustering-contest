移工休閒區涉歧視？　韓國瑜怒嗆記者「你不要扭曲我」
05 Nov 2019, 05:43 by 謝文哲, 林煒凱
國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜昨（4日）到南投舉辦工商座談會，當中提到設立「外籍移工休閒綜合區」，被媒體質疑是否涉及歧視。對此，韓國瑜動怒先是砲轟提問記者「完全故意扭曲」他的問題，韓國瑜重申他「沒說過外籍移工集中管理」，隨後更要該名記者重述一遍他所說的話。
韓國瑜傾聽之旅昨天在南投參加工商座談會，有企業主提議，假日時附近的里長不得閒，因為常有「外勞」發生糾紛，雖不一定是南投當地的「外勞」，也可能是外地前來的，因而希望設置「外勞休閒綜合區」。
事後聯訪時有媒體詢問「外勞設定專區集中管理，不覺得涉及歧視問題嗎？」韓國瑜一聽反怒問：「我有說集中管理嗎？」並認為記者「你的問題好像扭曲了我的答覆」。韓國瑜進一步解釋表示，外籍移工休閒以交通要衝為主，他們因南來北往，可與外籍移工的好朋友相聚，並對發問的媒體說「你完全故意扭曲我的問題。」
韓國瑜強調「如果外籍移工需要一些休閒區，政府可以去思考。」隨後更要該名記者重複一遍。最後，韓國瑜再度丟下「麻煩不要扭曲我的講法，非常感謝你」隨即轉頭就走。

Is it a discrimination in the transfer and leisure area? Korean Yu Roar reporter ""You don't want to distort me""
05 Nov 2019, 05:43 by Xie Wenzhe, Lin Yikai
Kuomintang presidential candidate South Korea Yu (4th) went to Nantou to hold a business symposium, which mentioned the establishment of a ""foreign transfer and leisure complex"", which was questioned by the media about discrimination. In this regard, South Korea's Yu Mou was the first to bombard the reporter's question of ""completely deliberately distorting"" him. South Korea Yu reiterated that he ""had not said that foreign migrants are centrally managed,"" and later asked the reporter to repeat what he said.
The South Korean Yu listening tour yesterday attended the industry and symposium in Nantou. Some business owners suggested that the length of the neighborhood near the holiday should not be idle, because there are often disputes about ""foreign labor"", although it is not necessarily the ""foreign labor"" of Nantou. It may be from a foreign country, so I hope to set up a ""foreign labor leisure complex"".
During the joint visit, some media asked ""The foreign workers set up a centralized area for centralized management. Do you think it involves discrimination?"" South Korea’s Yu Yi asked, ""Is there a centralized management?"" and thought that the reporter ""Your problem seems to be distorted."" My reply."" South Korea Yu further explained that foreign migrant workers are mainly traffic-oriented. They come to the north to meet foreign friends who are working in foreign countries, and say to the media questioning that ""you completely deliberately distort my problems.""
South Korea Yu stressed that ""if foreign migrants need some leisure areas, the government can think about it."" Then the reporter will repeat it. In the end, South Korea Yu once again left the ""trouble, don't distort my teaching, thank you very much"" and then turned around and left.
