【鏡書摘】朱令的四十五年：北京清華女學生毒殺疑案〈上〉

05 Nov 2019, 05:30

朱令是北京清華大學化學系九二級（1992年入學）學生，1994年12月，她因不明原因離奇病倒，幾近死亡。在她的高中同學將病症貼上在當時中國剛剛萌芽的互聯網之後，獲得來自全球熱心網民與專業人士的指點，得以找出病因為「鉈中毒」並因此存活下來，雖然腦部及諸多生理機能已嚴重受損。
這是中國第一宗互聯網求助事件。
由於朱令鉈中毒事件涉及了中國最高醫療單位之一的「北京協和醫院」的醫療疏失、清華大學對有毒物質的管理失職，以及朱令可能是被自己同班、同寢、高幹家庭出身的同學下毒，卻因該同學的特權身分始終無法真正逮捕歸案等狀況，再加上此為中國首例互聯網求助事件及新聞媒體的推波助瀾，因而引起中國社會及海內外網民的高度關注與討論，是中國當代知名的疑案之一。
本刊特摘選《朱令的四十五年：北京清華女學生毒殺疑案》部分章節，與讀者分享此一驚心動魄的故事和當時中國的時代氛圍。
扈斌記得，一九九五年四月初，春節前曾和他一起到朱家看望的中學女同學告訴他，朱令又一次住院了。當時他的感覺是吃了一驚，「因為第一次見她以後感覺她的情況已經好轉了，而這一次聽說情況非常嚴重，竟然住進了協和的ICU。」
貝志城就是在這個時候接到了扈斌的電話。他記得那天是四月八日，電話裡扈斌「語氣沉重」，說「你最後去看看朱令，可能這回是最後一面了」。和朱令初、高中都同學、初三有段時間還坐前後座的貝志城馬上答應了，同去的還有另外一個即將出國讀研究生的同學。
此時分別就讀北大和清華的貝志城跟朱令已經將近三年幾乎沒有見過面，對她的印象依然停留在高中階段的風華正茂。後來接受電視採訪的時候，貝志城回憶起自己被病房裡看到的情景驚呆了：「在腦海裡，朱令是一個很活潑、很開朗、很健康又聰明的女孩。在ICU看到她的時候，幾乎全身赤裸，插著很多管子。」——二〇〇七年央視《東方時空》在播出專題片《朱令的十二年》使用貝志城的這段採訪錄音時，貼上了朱令在病床上圓睜雙眼、驚恐痛苦的面部特寫。隨之，貝志城說自己腦子被嚇得一片空白：「第一反應是想拔腿就跑，然後感覺腿發軟了，就像灌了鉛一樣」。

一九九五年，全中國可以連接互聯網的電腦終端只有四百多台

出了病房的貝志城希望能想出一些話安慰在外面已經日夜守護了一個月的朱令父母。他記得他們「很堅強，但也無奈，好像接受命運的這種樣子」，便希望挖空腦筋想出辦法安慰他們，用他的話說是「希望自己是上帝才好」。
使用當時在中國還是新事物的互聯網求助，就是在這個時候靈光一現蹦入他腦海的。要知道，一九九五年，全國可以連接互聯網的電腦終端只有四百多台，大多數人根本聞所未聞。二〇一三年，當復旦黃洋投毒案使得朱令案重新獲得全國關注的時候，我在北京採訪過貝志城。當時的他已經成為了一名相當成功的軟體行業企業家，並由於對朱令事件長達十餘年的深度介入和互聯網時代對公共事件的率性直言成為了一名頗具影響力的「網路大V」。
回憶起這個靈光一現的念頭，他歸之為「巧合」：「當時中國只有三個機構在做實驗，清華、化工大學，還有中科院集團所。說出來頻寬聽了都可笑，每個就256K，全中國加起來還不如現在我們家平常的寬頻。湊巧，我們力學系在北大校外，跟清華一牆之隔，一個單獨的院子。當時有個教授，自己爬梯子，從清華拉了一根網線，在系裡做這個實驗。

四月十日，他們在北大機房向Usenet和Bitnet中所有和醫學有關的郵件組發出了求助信

和當時的大多數高校理工科實驗室一樣，教授麾下大多數是研究生負責具體動手實驗。貝志城宿舍的蔡全清雖是本科生，卻剛好獲得機會參與打下手，回到宿舍便向貝志城他們普及了這個新事物。「腦子裡就聽到這麼一個神奇的東西，說可以跟全世界聯繫。當時用的還都是一種類似於郵電組的BBS，叫做bitnet，這樣做科研的東西」，貝志城記得。
朱明新（朱令的母親）後來接受採訪時回憶，當時幾乎窮盡各種方法的她已經有些絕望了，「能多一個提供治療的機會，我當然不反對了。我說你能做就幫我做做吧。」
就這樣，貝志城拿到了一份複印的病例，立即回宿舍找能用Unix上網的蔡全清幫忙。四月十日，他們在北大機房向Usenet和Bitnet中所有和醫學有關的郵件組發出了求助信，用不算地道的英文描述了朱令的病情：

一九九四年十二月五號感到腹痛，繼而發展為全身劇痛。持續三天後開始脫髮，面神經麻痹，中樞眼肌麻痹，呼吸障礙，目前已失去自主呼吸能力。


「鉈」這個字，中文的發音是「Ta」，在當時能正確發音的人並不多

Thallium，在英文裡是個相當生僻的詞彙。當它高頻率出現在貝志城面前的電腦螢幕上時，他並不知道這是什麼意思。在後來接受《三聯生活周刊》採訪的時候，他回憶，十號晚上求助郵件僅僅發出幾分鐘就收到了第一封回覆：「是個愛爾蘭人，說會為朱令祈禱。第二封就提到了一個詞——Thallium。」
根據《美國醫學》（US Medicine）一九九五年十二月的報導，美國海軍軍醫、生物測定學和預防醫學助理教授史蒂夫·康年（Steve Cunnion）博士在四月十日收到了求助郵件，而他的回覆也成為了最早做出的正確診斷。當天晚些時候，曾在美國駐華使館做醫生、當時已經調回華盛頓美國國務院的醫生約翰·奧迪斯（John Aldis）以及加州醫生羅伯特·芬克（Robert Fink）也都收到了求助信件。
凌晨五點的時候，北大男生們已經收到了一百多封答覆郵件。貝志城回到宿舍查了英文字典，「這才知道原來叫『鉈』，化合物有毒」。
「鉈」這個字，中文的發音是「Ta」，在當時能正確發音的人並不多，瞭解這種元素的就更是寥寥可數。鉈在元素週期表的原子序數是81，原子量204，是一種較重、灰色、柔軟的貧金屬（poor metal），在自然界並不以單質存在。化合物則極易溶於水，無色無味，含有劇毒。

他們收到的郵件愈來愈多，很多都包含「鉈」這個字

英國化學家威廉．克魯克斯（Sir William Crookes）和克洛德奧古斯特．拉米（Claude-Auguste Lamy）一八六一年在硫酸工廠的反應殘留煙道灰中提取硒的時候發現了鉈，並運用了當時新發明的火焰光譜法對其進行鑒定，在光譜觀測到鉈會產生明顯的綠色新譜線。克魯克斯隨之提出了「Thallium」的名稱，這來自希臘文中的「θαλλός」（thallos），即「綠芽」之意。
當貝志城和他的同學們收到的郵件愈來愈多，很多都包含「鉈」這個字。用他當時參與瀏覽郵件的北大同學、宿舍裡英語程度最好的吳向軍的話來形容，那是因為當時「網路上面垃圾很少。互聯網還是一個非常學術的環境，所以回覆的品質也非常的高。」
貝志城後來在網路上詳細回憶了當時的整個過程。面對的第一個問題是從Unix終端下來的郵件會整體打包成一個大文字檔，在電腦上無法閱讀。他同宿舍的好朋友劉蒞便主動請纓，用微軟的Access寫了個軟體，先把郵件拆分成一封封，然後把標題、寄件者摘取出來存進資料庫。之後同宿舍的另一位同學王惠文也加入了，幾個男生一起完善程式，依據來信人是否醫生、判斷是哪種病、回信頻率等變數設立一個權重打分機制，衡量其嚴肅和可信度，決定要特別優先給誰回信。同時把比較多提到的關鍵字，比如鉈中毒、格林—巴厘綜合症、萊姆病（Lyme disease）等作索引，看被提到的頻率有多高。在大量的判斷都指向鉈中毒之後，他們還用關鍵字搜索分類，把不同的診斷方案、治療辦法分出來。

發布求助信那天是個週一，貝志城週三就給朱令的父親吳承之打電話

四月十日發布求助信那天是個週一，貝志城週三就給朱令的父親吳承之打電話，「怯生生地提到鉈中毒這個可能」， 他記得，電話那頭吳承之輕輕地苦笑了，說這個可能協和早考慮了，但是「已經排除了」。
在朱令父母記載的日誌上，後來寫下了這之後半個月的情況：「緊急求救信迅即收到世界各地醫生、專家等人士的七百七十六份回覆電子郵件，其中三百九十五份為醫務工作者的診斷建議。在三百九十五份中有二百六十六份認為是中毒，其中一百零六份明確提出可能是鉈鹽中毒。不斷收到『請儘快為朱令檢測鉈』的郵件。」
北大科學傳播中心的學者劉華傑教授在一九九五年五月把這起全中國第一例互聯網求助和會診寫成了報導，發表在六月七日的《南方周末》頭版上。多年後他還記得，那是清華力學系陳耀松教授通過電話線接到了北大計算中心的一臺伺服器，「陳老師個人支付了不少網路費」。作為學者，劉華傑當時的想法是，「這個事件頗為值得進行傳播學分析。」頗為耐人尋味的是，《南方周末》的這篇報導還影響了有關部門對於即將大規模使用的互聯網的印象，還「曾到北大調查學生在網上是否幹了壞事」。


一個紐約打來的越洋電話，「嘮嘮叨叨地說就是鉈中毒」


郵件不斷湧入的這半個多月，也是貝志城和他的同學、朱令父母乃至全世界關心朱令的人與協和醫院拉鋸的半個多月。當時的中國還相當封閉，這第一例互聯網求助事件一下子點爆了焦點，媒體開始關注事件，海外也對於中國有了互聯網、甚至還有人在互聯網求助就診而興奮不已。
然而，儘管「鉈」被愈來愈多地提及，但並未得到協和的重視。貝志城記得，由於對自己英語水準不夠自信，他在網上留下了從事外事工作的母親的電話號碼。有一天，母親接到一個紐約打來的越洋電話，「嘮嘮叨叨地說就是鉈中毒」。母親轉述後，貝志城回答，協和已經排除了重金屬中毒。後來他在網帖裡自嘲描述，「感謝那位醫生孜孜不倦和也許有些歧視中國人的精神」，他過兩天又打來電話，當被轉告說協和已經排除，對方「暴跳如雷說怎麼可能能排除所有重金屬中毒，以我所知，協和根本沒有全套這樣的設備，怎麼能排除！到底做沒做鉈中毒的化驗？」
被轉達了這個電話內容後，貝志城再次給吳承之打電話，詢問協和到底是依據什麼排除的鉈中毒，強調了那位「紐約客」的質疑。過了一天，吳承之回饋說協和沒有化驗，因為沒有設備，排除是因為症狀不像。

協和根本不同意，說醫院有規定不得把病人樣本拿出去

北大男生們把這個消息發布後，郵件組中一片譁然。貝志城記得，有人提出各種「土辦法」幫助確定診斷，朱明新也記得，曾經在美國駐華使館擔任醫務官、曾和協和醫院有過來往、也認識李舜偉的美國醫生奧迪斯當時旋即給李打電話，「說你們做不了的話，取一些血樣，我拿到香港或者日本去做化驗」。
然而在當時的中國，醫生不能也不敢拍板回應這樣的要求，「他要請示醫院醫務處、黨委，同不同意這個事。那個時候很戒備這些和國外的交往，必須（請示）這麼一圈下來，看看行不行」，朱明新說。
結果就是，協和根本不同意，說醫院有規定不得把病人樣本拿出去。檢驗也就沒能放行。
國外的醫生們仍在焦急地尋求給予幫助。朱明新記得，美國加州大學洛杉磯分校的一位學習醫學成像及電腦科學名叫李新的留學生還專門建立了一個網站，把朱令的病情都登載上去。「他打電話來說能不能做遠端醫療。但這邊（協和）都擋住，都說不行的。」

四月十八號，貝志城拿著一大摞英文郵件在ICU病房外等主任

貝志城也沒有放棄努力。多年後他在網帖中描述自己「如一般中國人一樣，開始找關係」。他通過母親找到了衛生部退休的老副部長，對方聽完訴說後，馬上給協和的副院長打了電話，委婉表達有群年輕人用新科技手段跟國外的專家有聯繫，打了一些資料供醫生參考，絕對沒有干擾治療的意思。貝志城記得，「之後，老人讓我直接去找那位副院長，我還記得她告訴我副院長是一位非常好的醫生，當年有個工人掉進糞坑窒息，現場急救設備不夠，現在的副院長、當時的年輕醫生自己用嘴把糞吸出來救活了工人」。
興奮的北大男生們列印了一些明顯是醫生寫的郵件，貝志城帶到了協和找到那位副院長。騰出空接待的副院長給ICU的主任打了電話，讓對方「接一下材料」。貝志城還記得，「我問他需不需要翻譯，對方笑笑說不用，協和的醫生英文都很好」。
於是，四月十八號，貝志城拿著一大摞英文郵件在ICU病房外等主任，朱令的舅舅進去問是否能接受一下材料，對方答覆太忙，等會。貝志城記得自己一直站在門口耐心的等，從早上到中午，對方就是不出來接。「他一直在病房跟人談話，在我因為腿酸剛走到遠處的長椅休息，他就一個箭步衝進廁所，然後又迅速衝出繼續在病房跟人談話。」中午，朱令舅舅再進去說了一次，結果「比較明確，就是說資料對他們沒用，不要」。
於是，等待了一整天的貝志城充滿挫折感地走出了協和的大門。多年後他在網帖裡回憶了自己的心情：「我還記得那天在院子裡我看著陰沉沉的天空，不知怎麼，憤青的情節發作默默地說了句『我能打敗你』。」（明日續完）

[Mirror Book Excerpt] Forty-five Years of Zhu Ling: Beijing Tsinghua Female Student's Poisoning Case <上〉

05 Nov 2019, 05:30

Zhu Ling is a student of the Department of Chemistry of Tsinghua University in Beijing (entered in 1992). In December 1994, she died of ill illness for unknown reasons and nearly died. After her high school classmates posted the illness on the Internet that was just sprouting in China at that time, she got the guidance from the global enthusiastic netizens and professionals to find out the cause of the disease because of “smoke poisoning” and survived, although the brain and many physiological functions Has been seriously damaged.
This is the first Internet help incident in China.
The Zhu Lingqi poisoning incident involved medical negligence of ""Beijing Union Medical College Hospital"", one of the highest medical units in China, Tsinghua University's management of toxic substances, and Zhu Ling may be under the class of his own class, bedtime, and high-ranking family. Poisoning, but because of the classmate’s privileged status, it has not been able to really arrest the case, and this is the first Internet help incident in China and the help of the news media. This has caused great concern and discussion among Chinese society and netizens at home and abroad. It is China. One of the most famous suspects in the contemporary era.
This special edition selects the chapters of Zhu Ling's Forty-five Years: Beijing Tsinghua Female Students' Poisoning Mystery, and shares this thrilling story with the readers and the atmosphere of China at that time.
Yan Bin remembers that in early April of 1995, the female middle school student who had visited him with him before the Spring Festival told him that Zhu Ling was hospitalized again. At that time, he felt a surprise. ""Because after seeing her for the first time, she felt that her condition has improved. This time I heard that the situation was very serious and I even lived in the ICU of Concord.""
Bei Zhicheng received a call from Yu Bin at this time. He remembered that day was April 8th. On the phone, Yan Bin was ""heavy in tone"" and said, ""You finally go to see Zhu Ling. Maybe this is the last one."" With Zhu Lingchu, high school students, and the third day of the third day, Bei Zhicheng, who was sitting in front and back, immediately agreed, and there was another classmate who was going to study abroad.
At this time, Beizhi and Zhu Ling, who were studying at Peking University and Tsinghua University, have barely met each other for nearly three years. The impression of her is still in the high school stage. Later, when interviewed by TV, Bei Zhicheng recalled that he was shocked by the scene he saw in the ward: ""In my mind, Zhu Ling is a very lively, very cheerful, healthy and intelligent girl. She saw her in ICU. At the time, almost naked, with a lot of pipes inserted."" - In the year of 2007, CCTV ""Oriental Time and Space"" was broadcasted on the feature film ""Twelve Years of Zhu Ling"" when using Beizhicheng's interview recording. Zhu Ling’s facial close-up, panting and painful face in the hospital bed. Then, Bei Zhicheng said that his brain was scared blank: ""The first reaction is to run out of the legs, and then feel the legs are soft, just like filling the lead.""

In 1995, there were only over 400 computer terminals connected to the Internet in China.

Bezhicheng, who came out of the ward, hopes to come up with some words to comfort Zhu Ling’s parents who have been guarding the day and night for a month. He remembers that they were ""very strong, but they were helpless, as if they accepted the fate."" They hoped to devote their brains to find ways to comfort them. In his words, ""I hope that I am God.""
Using the Internet, which was still a new thing in China at that time, was at that time, and at that time, the aura was in his mind. We must know that in 1995, there were only over 400 computer terminals connected to the Internet nationwide, and most of them were unheard of. In 2013, when the Fudan Huangyang poisoning case made the Zhu Ling case regain national attention, I interviewed Bei Zhicheng in Beijing. At that time, he had become a very successful software industry entrepreneur, and became an influential ""network"" due to the deep involvement of Zhu Ling’s incident for more than ten years and the blunt bluntness of public events in the Internet age. V"".
Recalling this thought of a flash of light, he turned it into ""coincidence"": ""At that time, there were only three institutions in China doing experiments, Tsinghua University, the Chemical University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It’s ridiculous to say that the bandwidth is ridiculous. As far as 256K is concerned, the whole China is not as good as our usual broadband. Now, our mechanics department is outside the Peking University campus, separated from Tsinghua University by a wall. At that time, there was a professor who climbed the ladder and pulled a net from Tsinghua University. Line, do this experiment in the department.

On April 10th, they sent a letter of help to all medical-related mail groups in Usenet and Bitnet at Peking University.

Like most science and engineering laboratories at that time, most of the professors are graduate students responsible for specific hands-on experiments. Although Cai Quanqing of the Beizhicheng dormitory is an undergraduate student, he just got the opportunity to participate in the fight. When he returned to the dormitory, he popularized this new thing to Beizhicheng. ""I heard such a magical thing in my mind, saying that I can contact the world. At that time, I used a BBS similar to the post and telecommunications group, called bitnet, to do research."" Beizhicheng remembers.
Zhu Mingxin (Zhu Ling’s mother) later recalled in an interview that she was almost desperate when she almost exhausted all kinds of methods. “There is no more opportunity to provide treatment. I certainly don’t object. I said that you can do it for me. .""
In this way, Bei Zhicheng got a copy of the case, immediately went back to the dormitory to find Cai Quanqing who can use Unix Internet to help. On April 10th, they sent a letter of help to all medical-related mailing groups in Usenet and Bitnet at Peking University Computer Room, describing Zhu Ling’s condition in plain English:

On December 5, 1994, he felt abdominal pain and developed into a generalized pain. After three days, hair loss began, facial nerve palsy, central eye muscle paralysis, and respiratory disorders, and the ability to breathe spontaneously has been lost.


The word ""铊"", the pronunciation of Chinese is ""Ta"", and there are not many people who can pronounce correctly at the time.

Thallium is a rather unfamiliar word in English. When it appeared on the computer screen in front of Beizhicheng at a high frequency, he didn't know what it meant. In an interview with Sanlian Life Weekly, he recalled that on the 10th, the help mail received a first reply in just a few minutes: ""It is an Irishman who said that he would pray for Zhu Ling. The second one mentioned one. Word - Thallium.""
According to a report by US Medicine in December 1995, Dr. Steve Cunnion, assistant professor of military, biometrics and preventive medicine at the US Navy, received on April 10th. Helping the mail, and his reply has become the earliest correct diagnosis. Later that day, John Aldis, a doctor who had been transferred back to the US Embassy in China, and a doctor who had been transferred back to Washington, USA, and California doctor Robert Fink also received help letters.
At five in the morning, Peking University boys have received more than one hundred reply emails. Bei Zhicheng went back to the dormitory to check the English dictionary. ""This is what I found to be called ""铊"" and the compound is poisonous.""
The word ""铊"", the pronunciation of Chinese is ""Ta"", there are not many people who can pronounce correctly at that time, and there are only a few who know this element. The atomic number of the periodic table is 81, the atomic weight is a heavier, gray, soft poor metal, which does not exist in nature. The compound is very soluble in water, colorless and odorless, and contains highly toxic.

They have received more and more emails, many of which contain the word ""铊"".

British chemist William. Sir William Crookes and Claude Auguste. Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered helium when he extracted selenium from the residual flue ash in the sulfuric acid plant in 1861, and used the newly invented flame spectroscopy method to identify it.铊 will produce a clear new green line. Crookes then proposed the name ""Thallium"", which comes from the Greek word ""θαλλός"" (thallos), which means ""green shoot"".
When Bezhicheng and his classmates received more and more mails, many of them contained the word ""铊"". Using the words of Wu Xiangjun, who was the most English-speaking student in the dormitory and the best English in the dormitory, it was because ""there was very little garbage on the Internet. The Internet is still a very academic environment, so the quality of the reply is also very high. .""
Bei Zhicheng later recalled the entire process at that time on the Internet. The first problem faced was that the mail coming down from the Unix terminal would be packaged into a large text file that could not be read on the computer. Liu Li, a good friend of his dormitory, took the initiative to ask for a software using Microsoft Access. The mail was first split into a seal, and the title and sender were extracted and stored in the database. Later, Wang Huiwen, another classmate in the same dormitory, also joined. Several boys worked together to improve the program. Based on whether the letter is a doctor, whether it is a disease or a frequency of reply, a weighting mechanism is established to measure its seriousness and credibility. Decide which priority to give back to others. At the same time, the more frequently mentioned keywords, such as sputum poisoning, Green-Bali syndrome, Lyme disease, etc., are indexed to see how high the frequency is mentioned. After a large number of judgments point to cockroach poisoning, they also use keyword search classification to separate different diagnostic plans and treatment methods.

The day of the release of the letter of help was a Monday, and Bei Zhicheng called Zhu Ling’s father Wu Chengzhi on Wednesday.

On the day of the release of the letter of help on April 10th, it was Monday. Bei Zhicheng called Zhu Ling’s father Wu Chengzhi on Wednesday. “He said that the possibility of poisoning is poisonous.” He remembered that Wu Chengzhi’s phone was slightly bitter. It is said that this possible agreement will be considered early, but ""it has been ruled out.""
In the log recorded by Zhu Ling's parents, he wrote the following half-monthly situation: ""Emergency Help Letter received 767 reply emails from doctors, experts and other people from all over the world, including 390. Five of the diagnostic recommendations for medical workers. Of the 395, 266 were considered poisoning, of which 106 were clearly indicated to be sputum salt poisoning. Zhu Ling detected the e-mail.""
Professor Liu Huajie, a scholar at the Peking University Science Communication Center, wrote the first Internet help and consultation in China in May 1995 and published it on the front page of the Southern Weekend on June 7. After many years, he still remembers that Professor Chen Yaosong from the Department of Mechanics of Tsinghua University received a server from the Peking University Computing Center via telephone line. ""Mr. Chen personally paid a lot of Internet fees."" As a scholar, Liu Huajie’s idea at the time was, “This event is quite worthy of communication analysis.” It is quite intriguing that the report of Southern Weekend also affected the impression of the relevant departments on the Internet that will be used on a large scale. Also, ""I went to Peking University to investigate whether students did bad things online.""


An overseas phone call from New York, ""Oh, it is poisoning.""


More than half a month after the influx of mail, Beizhicheng and his classmates, Zhu Ling’s parents and even the world’s people who care about Zhu Ling and Concord Hospital saw it for more than half a month. At that time, China was still quite closed. This first case of Internet help incident suddenly exploded. The media began to pay attention to the incident. Overseas, it was also excited about the Internet in China and even people who were seeking help from the Internet.
However, although ""铊"" has been mentioned more and more, it has not received the attention of Concord. Bei Zhicheng remembers that because he was not confident enough about his English proficiency, he left the phone number of the mother who worked in foreign affairs on the Internet. One day, my mother received a phone call from New York, ""I am arrogant."" After the mother retelled, Bei Zhicheng replied that Concord had ruled out heavy metal poisoning. Later, he self-deprecating in the net post, ""Thanks to the doctor for being tireless and perhaps discriminating against the Chinese."" He called again after two days. When he was told that the Concord had been ruled out, the other party ""had a violent thunder and said how could it be ruled out."" All heavy metal poisoning, as far as I know, Concord does not have a complete set of such equipment, how can it be excluded! In the end, do not do the poisoning test?""
After being conveyed to the contents of this phone, Bei Zhicheng once again called Wu Chengzhi to ask if the Concord was based on what was excluded from the poisoning and emphasized the question of the ""New Yorker."" After a day, Wu Chengzhi gave back that the Concord did not have a test, because there was no equipment, and the exclusion was because the symptoms were not like.

Concord simply disagreed, saying that the hospital has regulations that should not take out patient samples.

After the news of the Peking University boys released this news, the mail group was in turmoil. Bei Zhicheng remembers that some people have proposed various ""earth measures"" to help determine the diagnosis. Zhu Mingxin also remembers that the American doctor who had served as a medical officer at the US Embassy in China and Zenghe Xiehe Hospital, who also met Li Weiwei, immediately gave Li Call, ""If you can't do it, take some blood samples. I will get Hong Kong or Japan to do the test.""
However, in China at the time, doctors could not and did not dare to respond to such a request. ""He wants to ask the hospital medical department and party committee to disagree with this matter. At that time, he was very alert to these exchanges with foreign countries. He must (please) Circle it down and see if it works,"" said Zhu Mingxin.
As a result, Concord did not agree at all, saying that the hospital had regulations that could not take out patient samples. The test did not pass.
Doctors abroad are still anxiously seeking help. Zhu Mingxin remembers that an international student studying medical imaging and computer science called Li Xin at the University of California, Los Angeles, also set up a website to publish Zhu Ling's condition. ""He called to say if he could do remote medical treatment. But this (Concord) is blocked, and he can't say it.""

On April 18th, Bei Zhicheng took a large number of English mails and waited outside the ICU ward.

Bei Zhicheng did not give up efforts. Many years later, he described himself in the net post ""Like the average Chinese, starting to find a relationship."" He found the old deputy minister of the Ministry of Health through his mother. After listening to the complaint, he immediately called the vice president of the Concord. He euphemistically expressed that some young people had contact with foreign experts with new technology and played some The information is for the reference of the doctor and there is absolutely no interference with the treatment. Bei Zhicheng remembers, ""After that, the old man asked me to go directly to the vice president. I still remember that she told me that the vice president was a very good doctor. In the past, a worker fell into the pit and suffocated. The first aid equipment was not enough. The deputy dean, the young doctor at the time, used his mouth to suck the feces out to save the workers.""
Excited Peking University boys printed some emails that were obviously written by doctors. Bei Zhicheng brought Concord to find the vice president. The vice president who made the reception was called the director of the ICU and asked the other party to ""take the materials."" Bei Zhicheng still remembers, ""I asked him if he needed an interpreter. The other party smiled and said no, the Concord doctors are very good at English.""
So, on April 18th, Bei Zhicheng took a large number of English mails outside the ICU ward and waited for the director. Zhu Ling’s intrusion asked if he could accept the materials. The other party’s reply was too busy. Bei Zhicheng remembers that he has been standing patiently at the door, and from the morning to noon, the other party is not coming out. ""He has been talking to people in the ward. When I was resting on a bench that was just too far away, he rushed into the toilet and then quickly rushed out to talk to people in the ward."" At noon, Zhu Lingyu Going in and saying it once, the result is ""clear, that is, the information is useless to them, don't.""
So, waiting for a whole day, Beizhicheng came out of the door of Concord with frustration. Many years later, he recalled his feelings in the net post: ""I still remember that in the yard I looked at the gloomy sky that day, somehow, the angry youth plot silently said ""I can beat you."" Continued tomorrow
