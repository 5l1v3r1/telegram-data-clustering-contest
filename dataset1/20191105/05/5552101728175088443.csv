總統蔡英文今（5日）在YouTube公布「英文英文」系列第5集影片，一開始由網紅蔡阿嘎戴上假髮模仿蔡英文，還搞笑自稱英文名字是「Vegetable（菜） and English（英文）」。而蔡英文看了蔡阿嘎模仿她的影片笑說：「他還有幾分姿色喔！」效果十足。
今天是世界棒球12強賽在台中洲際棒球場開打的日子，蔡英文在影片現身後強調：「我才是真正的蔡英文。」，而這集「英文英文」也以介紹棒球英文單字為主。
蔡英文介紹的英文詞彙包括「亞洲棒球錦標賽Asian Baseball Championship」「MVP（最有價值球員）Most Valuable Player」「投手pitcher」「捕手catcher」「打擊手batter」「九局下半 bottom of the ninth inning」「再見全壘打 walk-off home run」「雙殺 double play」等。
蔡阿嘎還亂入把MVP說成「Metropolitan Video President」（大都會影片有總統，意指先前他與蔡英文和拍美國職棒大都會隊的台灣日開球影片。）小英看了這段影片笑說：「他還有幾分姿色喔！」
蔡英文說，世界12強攸關能否進軍明年東京奧運，奧運的英文是「Olympic Games」。最後她也教大家用英文為台灣隊加油：「Let's go Taiwan, its our time to shine.（台灣加油！這是我們閃耀的時刻。）」
這支影片片尾有2個彩蛋，首先是網紅阿翰客串「日本型男宮森先生」模仿日本人說中文口音，另外則是民進黨新北立委候選人賴品妤穿著性感露肩的cosplay服裝擔任「新北市求職者賴小姐」。
