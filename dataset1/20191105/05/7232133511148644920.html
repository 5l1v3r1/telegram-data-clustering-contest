      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, we saw a downside correction in BCH price below the $290 level against the US Dollar. However, BCH price remained well bid above the $280 and $285 support levels. As a result, the price is now moving higher and it is rising steadily towards the $300 resistance level.</p>
      <p>If there is a successful break above the $300 and $305 resistance levels, the price could continue to rise towards the $325 and $330 levels. On the downside, the main support is near the $285 and $280 levels.</p>
      <h3>Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC) and EOS Price Analysis</h3>

      <p>Litecoin price is gaining traction and it recently climbed more than 5% to surpass the $60.00 resistance area. LTC price even broke the $62.00 resistance area, opening the doors for more gains towards the $65.00 and $66.00 resistance levels in the coming sessions.</p>
