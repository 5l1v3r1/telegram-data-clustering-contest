      <p>If you own an NVIDIA SHIELD TV device and have been experiencing a Match Content Color Space issues, a new fix appears to be available.</p>
      <p>At present, the hotfix only applies to owners of the new <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-only-android-tv-player-worth-buying.html">SHIELD TV (2019) models</a>.</p>
      <p>NVIDIA does warn that the latest image with fix might impact on HDHomeRun functionality for some.</p>

      <h3>Match Content Color Space fix</h3>
      <p>When NVIDIA announced SHIELD TV Experience Upgrade 8.0 (the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/07/not-just-android-pie-everything-included-with-nvidia-shield-tv-experience-upgrade-8.html">Android 9 Pie upgrade</a>), one of the features included was Match Content Color Space.</p>
      <p>The general idea with the feature is that when it's enabled the system can automatically match the display mode to the content.</p>
      <p>However, ever since the launch of the feature, some users have had issues with it. For others, it hasn't worked at all.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This latter group is where the latest update comes in. NVIDIA specifically notes the hotfix is for those who are encountering "<i>Match Content Color Space feature not working</i>."</p>
      <p>Since the initial release of the feature, NVIDIA has routinely rolled out other fixes related to Match Content Color Space. One of the more recent ones accompanied <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/nvidia-shield-tv-8-0-1-update-4k-fix-streaming-issue.html">SHIELD TV Experience Upgrade 8.0.1</a>.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, those fixes did not fix the problem for everyone.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>A few users on the forum where the update announcement was <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/shield-tv/9/326572/2019-shield-experience-upgrade-810-hotfix-image/">posted</a> have confirmed receipt of the update, and that it appears to have fixed the problem for them.</p>
      <h3>The SHIELD TV fix is ready, but you need to request it</h3>
      <p>While the fix is ready, NVIDIA explains this is not a "<i>fully certified</i>" fix. It is there for those who are experiencing the issue and want to remedy it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>NVIDIA also states the next official release will arrive as a fully certified update.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Due to this, those who want the fix do appear to have to apply for it. NVIDIA has a Google Doc you can fill out if you want the update sent to your device. To access the Google Doc, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsPXV4Ws4MQ3xwwkvW0LGPdE_1qftwI8Cx-O6n1wlzjlL6ng/viewform">click here</a> and note it requires the serial number of the device the update should be applied to.</p>
      <p>As a precaution, NVIDIA is warning SHIELD TV device owners to avoid this update if they use a HDHomeRun. This is of particular importance as there's no easy way to roll back.</p>
      <p>The reason for this is there seems to be an issue with DRM channel functionality following the update. The warning specially states "<i>HD Homerun DRM channels will not work with the HotFix image so if that feature is important to you, please avoid the HotFix image</i>."</p>

      <p>NVIDIA says this is the only major issue they've encountered so far with the update.</p>
