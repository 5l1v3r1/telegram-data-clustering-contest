QUINCY, Mass. - Two men have been arrested in connection to the fatal beating of a man outside an American Legion post in Quincy earlier this year.
Sources tell Boston 25 News the two men are the sons of a retired Quincy police officer. Their names have not been released at this time.
According to the Norfolk District Attorney's office, both suspects will be arraigned at Norfolk Superior Court on Wednesday at 2 p.m in connection to the homicide.



In January, 44-year-old Christopher McCallum of Bridgewater was found unconscious and bleeding in the parking lot of the Robert Nickerson Post 382 on Moon Road in Quincy on Jan. 27.
McCallum was transported to Boston Medical Center where he was put on life support, but later succumbed to his injuries.
According to the DA's office, McCallum had been at the American Legion Post to watch the ""Charlie Don't Surf"" band when a fight broke out. 



Investigators said McCallum had been trying to break up the fight when he was punched and fell, hitting his head. 
Very little information was released following the incident, where police said there had been no witnesses or video of what happened.
Quincy Police turned the case over to the Norfolk County District Attorney's office following the incident to avoid any potential conflict of interest, because many Quincy Police detectives have connections to people who were there that night.
The names of the suspects have not been released at this time.
McCallum is survived by his wife of 20 years and their three teenage sons.
Following the announcement of the arrests, the family released a statement, saying:
""The McCallum family is grateful to the Norfolk County District Attorney and State Police for their nine-month investigation of Chris McCallum's death. We continue to struggle with his loss daily and look forward to finding him justice through the court system. The McCallum family will never be the same without his loving presence.""
