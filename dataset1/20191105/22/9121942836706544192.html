      <p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Jaden Schwartz scored at 3:28 of overtime to give the St. Louis Blues a 2-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It was the fifth consecutive win for the defending Stanley Cup champions, who are 7-1-0 in their past eight games.</p>
      <p>The deciding goal came on a 3-on-0 break after Vancouver’s Tyler Myers fired a shot that missed wide of the St. Louis net and caromed way up the ice with three Blues chasing. Schwartz finished off a tic-tac-toe play alongside Alex Pietrangelo and Brayden Schenn.</p>
      <p>Canucks goalie Jacob Markstrom smashed his stick in anger afterward.</p>
      <p>Vancouver rookie Quinn Hughes tied the game at 1 with 3:35 remaining in the third period. Hughes sent a fluttering shot from the blue line that went over the shoulder of Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington. Elias Pettersson was screening on the play.</p>
      <p>Tyler Bozak scored his first goal of the season for the Blues. Binnington made 33 saves and is 6-1-0 in his last seven games.</p>
      <p>Markstrom stopped 25 shots for the Canucks, who are 7-1-3 in the last 11.</p>

      <p>Vancouver had a chance to tie it earlier in the third when David Perron was called for cross-checking defenseman Chris Tanev at 5:44. The Canucks managed just one shot on the power play and finished 0 for 4 with the man advantage, mustering only six shots.</p>
      <p>Jake Virtanen also came close in the third when he rang a shot off the post at 7:51. Brandon Sutter had a short-handed breakaway at 10:45 but couldn’t beat Binnington.</p>
      <p>Bozak’s goal came at 3:37 of the second. Sammy Blais made a nice play in the corner, feathering a puck between two Canucks defenders to Bozak, who tucked it past Markstrom.</p>
      <p>The first period was scoreless but Vancouver had two great chances. Early on Pettersson turned Brock Boeser’s pass into a breakaway but was stopped by Binnington. Later on, J.T. Miller found himself alone in front but couldn’t beat the Blues goalie.</p>
      <p>Pettersson had another chance in the second. He used his speed to distance himself from a pair of Blues chasing him and ripped a shot that Binnington got a piece of.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester played in his 1,200th career game. . Vancouver’s win over San Jose on Saturday gave the Canucks 20 points in 14 or fewer games for the fourth time in franchise history. . The Canucks scored 45 goals in October, the third-best total for the month in franchise history. . Referee Ian Walsh was helped off the ice at 3:25 of the first period but was back on to start the second.</p>
