      <h2>EastEnders teased baby birth drama for Louise Mitchell and stepmother Sharon, with both characters pregnant with Keanu Taylor's babies</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:47:28+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:47</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>EastEnders has hinted at Christmas birth drama for both Louise Mitchell and her stepmother Sharon Mitchell, ahead of the Sheanu baby twist revealed.</p>
      <p>The Mitchells will be torn apart on Christmas Day when Sharon's fling with Keanu Taylor, the fiancé of stepdaughter Louise, is exposed.</p>
      <p>Keanu is the father of Sharon's unborn baby, while he is also expecting a baby with Louise.</p>
      <p>Now, amid the chaos and hints of a "bloodbath" headed for the family, Keanu revealed how long Louise had left until her due date.</p>
      <p>Discussing her pregnancy, Keanu appeared to hint a Christmas birth was likely - with Sharon also due around the same time as Louise.</p>

      <p>Mel Owen was winding Keanu up as she continued to spoil Louise on her birthday.</p>
      <p>Keanu felt Mel was smothering his fiancée, and knowing that she knew about his affair left him unnerved.</p>
      <p>As Mel seemed determined to plan a surprise 18th birthday party for her Goddaughter, Keanu wasn't keen.</p>

      <p>He told her that with Louise being seven months pregnant she probably wasn't up for a huge event.</p>
      <p>With her being this far gone in her pregnancy, it means she has around a month and a half left until her due date.</p>
      <p>This happens to be the same amount of time roughly until Christmas, or at least the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Viewers believed this was the confirmation they needed, with one fan saying: "They’ve basically just confirmed Louise will give birth at Christmas/ when all the affair stuff comes out."</p>

      <p>Louise or even Sharon could give birth early, or might even be late with their exact due dates yet to be confirmed - while they are close together.</p>
      <p>But could this comment from Keanu suggest, given the dates, that the babies are set to be born around Christmas Day or even on the day?</p>
      <p>It comes amid confirmation that the Mitchells will take centre stage in the big Christmas episode, as Keanu's affair and baby secret is exposed.</p>
      <p>While it's possible that the potential of two births could be too much chaos to feature in the same episode as rumoured stunts, showdowns and an affair reveal - not to mention fears Keanu will be killed off in a shooting - it is soap land after all.</p>
