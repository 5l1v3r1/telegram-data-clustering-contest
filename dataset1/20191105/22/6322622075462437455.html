      <p>LIVERPOOL, England (Nov 6): European champions Liverpool moved within one step of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage with a 2-1 win over Belgium's Genk at Anfield on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The win leaves Liverpool, who fielded a weakened side ahead of Sunday's top-of-the-table Premier League clash with Manchester City, top of Group E with nine points.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, with forwards Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane named as substitutes, took the lead in the 14th minute with a close-range effort from Georginio Wijnaldum after James Milner's low cross from the left bounced off Sebastien Dewaest and fell to the Dutchman who scooped home.</p>
      <p>Juergen Klopp's side had several chances to extend their lead but were pegged back four minutes before the break, when Ally Mbwana Samatta met a Bryan Heynen corner with a superbly-angled near-post header.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, playing in a less familiar advanced role, restored the home side's advantage in the 53rd minute, collecting a neat pass from Mohamed Salah on the edge of the box and beating Genk keeper Gaetan Coucke with a low drive on the turn.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were comfortably in control from then on but keeper Alisson Becker had to be alert nine minutes from the end to push out a dangerous shot from Heynen. - Reuters</p>
