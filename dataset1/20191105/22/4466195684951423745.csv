05 Nov 2019, 22:45 by Dewi Nurita, Zacharias Wuragil
TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Di tengah ramai serangan opini rekayasa penyiraman air keras terhadap dirinya, penyidik Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) Novel Baswedan kembali menjalani perawatan mata di Singapura. Novel ditemani dokter KPK, keluarga, dan istri selama berobat di negeri jiran itu.
“Dua hari di Singapura, yang kiri di operasi itu, tiba-tiba pendarahan di dalam,” ujar Novel saat dihubungi Tempo pada Selasa, 5 November 2019.
Novel disiram air keras oleh dua orang tak dikenal pada 11 April 2017. Ia diserang sepulang dari salat subuh berjamaah di Masjid Ihsan di dekat rumahnya.
Akibatnya, dua mata Novel terancam buta. Mata kirinya rusak hingga 95 persen dan harus menjalani operasi berkali-kali di Singapura. Jaringan mata kiri Novel sempat mati, sehingga harus diganti dengan jaringan gusi dan gigi. Pasca dioperasi, mata kiri Novel sudah bisa melirik dan bergerak ke kanan dan kiri, dia juga bisa membaca dengan kacamata plus empat.
“Tapi pandangan saya sempit, kayak melihat teropong. Tidak lebar. Lebar pandang itu sempit. Tapi lebih jelas melihat dengan mata kiri, yang kanan malah buram dan sensitif cahaya,” ujar Novel menceritakan kondisi matanya saat ini.
Sudah 2,5 tahun, kasus penyiraman air keras terhadap Novel ini belum juga terungkap. Sejumlah pemilik akun media sosial di Twitter malah menuding adanya rekayasa dalam penyiraman air keras terhadap Novel. Akun-akun itu mencuit dengan narasi soal adanya skenario.
""Mungkin dulu Novel Baswedan cuma kena tetes air keras, bukan disiram air keras macam vokalisnya saint loco yang mukanya melepuh semua,"" tulis pemilik akun @Agung***.
Tempo memperoleh salinan medical record Novel yang menyatakan bahwa Novel Baswedan mengalami luka parah di dua matanya. Medical record itu berasal dari Eye and Retina Surgeon Singapore. Catatan tersebut menjelaskan bahwa Novel menjalani serangkaian perawatan karena kerusakan di kedua matanya.

Novel Baswedan Goes Back to Eye Care in Singapore
05 Nov 2019, 22:45 by Dewi Nurita, Zacharias Wuragil
TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - In the midst of a storm of opinion attacks on hard water engineering against him, investigators at the Novel Baswedan Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) are undergoing eye treatment in Singapore. The novel was accompanied by the KPK doctor, family, and wife during treatment in the neighboring country.
""Two days in Singapore, which was left in the operation, there was sudden internal bleeding,"" Novel said when contacted by Tempo on Tuesday, November 5, 2019.
The novel was doused with hard water by two unknown people on April 11, 2017. He was attacked after returning from dawn prayers in congregation at the Ihsan Mosque near his home.
As a result, two novel eyes threatened with blindness. His left eye was damaged by 95 percent and had to undergo multiple operations in Singapore. Novel left eye tissue had died, so it must be replaced with gum tissue and teeth. After surgery, Novel's left eye can glance and move right and left, he can also read with glasses plus four.
""But my view is narrow, like seeing binoculars. Not wide. Wide viewing is narrow. But it is clearer to see with the left eye, the right one is blurry and sensitive to light, ""Novel said tells the condition of his eyes at this time.
It has been 2.5 years, the hard watering case against this novel has not been revealed. A number of social media account owners on Twitter even accuse the existence of engineering in splashing hard water on the Novel. The accounts tweet with narratives about the scenario.
""Maybe Baswedan's novel was only hit by a drop of hard water, not doused with hard water like the saint loco vocalist whose face was blistered all,"" wrote the account holder @Agung ***.
Tempo obtained a copy of Novel's medical record stating that Baswedan's novel suffered severe injuries in two of his eyes. The medical record comes from Eye and Retina Surgeon Singapore. The note explains that Novel underwent a series of treatments due to damage in both eyes.
