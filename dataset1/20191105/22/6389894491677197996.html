      <h1>Mothercare shuts up shop in UK as PwC called in for administration</h1>

      <p>Mothercare has called in the administrators, meaning it will shutter its 79 UK stores and put 2,500 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>Administrators from PwC said the baby retailer’s outlets will go in a phased closure, after the UK business had been “loss making for a number of years” despite its international franchises being profitable.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the company said it was incapable of being sufficiently profitable, and that it had not found a buyer.</p>
      <p>Joint administrator Zelf Hussain said: “This is a sad moment for a well-known High Street name.”</p>
      <p>He added that Mothercare “has been hit hard by increasing cost pressures and changes in consumer spending.”</p>
      <p>“It’s with real regret that we have to implement a phased closure of all UK stores. Our focus will be to help employees and keep the stores trading for as long as possible,” he said.</p>
