      <p>The airline said it sold 27.25 million new shares at 40 crowns per share in a private placement, a 13% discount to Tuesday’s closing price. It also raised $150 million via convertible bond issue.</p>
      <p>With mounting debts and suffering from the grounding of its 18 Boeing (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BA.N">BA.N</a>) 737 MAX aircraft, Norwegian has replaced breakneck expansion with cost cutting to regain profitability.</p>
      <p>The company also announced a deal with a Chinese firm in October to offload 27 new Airbus (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AIR.PA">AIR.PA</a>) planes to ease pressure on its finances and avoid becoming the latest airline to collapse.</p>
      <p>“The private placement received significant interest from both existing shareholders in the company and new high-quality investors. The convertible bond issue received significant interest from international and domestic investors,” it said.</p>
      <p>In a statement after the stock market closed, Europe’s third-largest budget airline by passenger numbers said the transactions would fully fund it “through 2020 and beyond based on the current business plan.”</p>
      <p>“The proceeds ... will secure required financing of working capital during the winter season and create headroom to financial covenants while completing the strategic transformation of the company,” it said.</p>
      <p>The airline also reported monthly figures showing passenger traffic declined in October from a year ago, the first such fall on record as the carrier cut loss-making routes from its network. The data had been scheduled for release on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Overall traffic, a measure of distance flown and the number of people carried (RPK), fell 3% year on year in October, the company said. Analysts in a Reuters poll on average had expected a fall of 12.1%.</p>
      <p>Norwegian’s RPK had until now risen every month since it was first listed on the Oslo Bourse in 2003, its records show.</p>
      <p>Trimming capacity at a rate of 5% year on year helped it fill aircraft, raising the so-called load factor to 87.1% from 85.0% in October 2018, in line with a Reuters poll.</p>
      <p>Its yield, or income per passenger carried and kilometre flown, rose to 0.40 crown in October from 0.38 crown a year ago, also in line with expectations.</p>
