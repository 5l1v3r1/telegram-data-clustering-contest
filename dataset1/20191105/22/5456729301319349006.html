      <p>It was goals galore at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night as Chelsea came from behind to hold Ajax to a 4-4 draw in one of the UEFA Champions League games.</p>
      <p>The Blues were trailing 3-1 at half time and fell further behind 10 minutes into the second half as it looked like a miserable night for Frank Lampard’s men.<br/>However Chelsea turned the game on the head just after the hour mark and almost got a win but it ended in a stalemate at 4-4.<br/>Chelsea had a miserable start just two minutes into the game as Tammy Abraham with an own goal gifted Ajax an early lead.<br/>However the hosts responded quick enough as Jorginho restored parity from the penalty spot.<br/>While one would think that Chelsea would seize the game after the equaliser, it was Ajax that registered two more goals to take a 3-1 lead into half time.</p>
      <p>The bad situation got worse for Chelsea as 10 minutes into the second half they conceded their fourth goal.</p>
      <p>However three quick fire goals inside 10 minutes saw Chelsea level up 4-4 and almost run away with a victory.</p>
      <p>Ajax had two players sent off in the second half of the encounter.</p>
      <p>In the other Group H tie, Valencia pummeled Victor Osimhen’s Lille 4-1.</p>
      <p>There was also shock at Camp Nou where Peter Olayinka and his Slavia Prague teammates held Barcelona to a barren draw.</p>
      <p>Liverpool secured a 2-1 victory over Genk which parades Nigerian striker Stephen Odey.<br/>Group games will continue on Wednesday as battle for places in the knock out stage hots up.</p>
