      <p>Bitcoin was trading close to the $9,400 price mark for a large part of the day but is showing signs of downward price behavior in recent hours. The world’s largest cryptocurrency traded at an intraday high of around $9,465, before losing ground towards its current trading price of around $9,311. BTC is reporting a moderate loss of 0.56% in the past 24 hours.</p>

      <p>According to Bitcoin statistician and commentator Willy Woo, bullish action should begin to surface after Bitcoin’s dip to $8,600, due to filling in a gap in futures markets. Thereafter, he said, Bitcoin needs a monthly close above $14,000 in order to then secure a longer-term bull market. He <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-analyst-second-phase-of-bull-market-triggers-at-14k">explained</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Once we get a monthly close above $14k, we'll be in the second phase of the bull market; a steady, lowish volatility, run in price. Should happen by the start of 2020, that's the best time to deploy capital.”</blockquote>
      <p>Perhaps Bitcoin’s price can take a clue from Stellar’s shot to the moon as the coin’s price surged 25% after the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/stellar-burns-over-55-billion-tokens-worth-47-billion-usd">announcement</a> was made that a 50% token burn of its total supply was completed. XLM is currently trading at a price of $0.084 per coin, reporting massive gains of more than 20% on the day, igniting claims that XLM might be able to trigger a new bull cycle.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, is currently sitting at $190 per coin and is showing a gain of around 1.86% at publishing time. </p>

      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a> has been trading relatively flat for the better part of the day. The third-largest coin by market capitalization is currently trading at $0.301 per coin, up 1.4% at press time. Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-stellars-55-billion-xlm-burn-trigger-a-new-bull-cycle">pointed</a> out that the Swell conference is approaching, which could potentially bring news and volatility to the markets at the same time that XRP price seems to be lining up for a breakout move.</p>
