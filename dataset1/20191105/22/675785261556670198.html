      <p>Losing the BBC would be bad for society and for democracy, peers are warning today.</p>
      <p>The Corporation faces unprecedented pressure amid competition from subscription services, such as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> , the Lords Communications and Digital Committee says.</p>
      <p>It found public sector broadcasters – PSBs – failed to appeal to certain viewers, such as 16 to 34-year-olds.</p>
      <p>Its 88-page report states: “Younger generations are not growing up with PSBs as previous generations did.”</p>
      <p>Chairman Lord Gilbert of Panteg said: “For many people, especially young people, watching TV in real-time is now the exception rather than the norm.”</p>

      <p>The committee also calls for cricket’s Ashes series and the British Open golf tournament to be added to the list of protected sports events which must be shown free.</p>
      <p>And it hit out at the Government for shifting the £745-million-a-year cost of giving free TV licences to the over-75s to the BBC.</p>
      <p>The Mirror is campaigning to keep the benefit, which, from June, will be given only to over-75s who are entitled to Pension Credit.</p>

      <p>The BBC has been landed with responsibility for funding free licences under a deal stitched up in 2015.</p>
      <p>The peers’ report says: “The decision on whether to provide free licences to the over-75s is a matter of welfare policy.</p>
      <p>"The BBC should not have been asked to take on this decision. Responsibility for licences for over-75s should be off the table in future licence negotiations.”</p>
      <p>Lord Gilbert concluded: “At a time of polarisation, public service broadcasters play a role in unifying the country through shared experiences.</p>
      <p>“If we fail to support our public service broadcasters, audiences would miss them when they’re gone.”</p>
