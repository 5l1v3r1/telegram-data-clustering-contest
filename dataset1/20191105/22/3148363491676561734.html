      <p>Biden is focused on the universal background check legislation which the Democrat-run House passed on February 27, 2019.</p>
      <p>Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/02/27/democrat-led-house-passes-bill-to-criminalize-private-gun-sales/">reported</a> that the legislation criminalizes private gun sellers by making it illegal for an individual to sell a gun to a life-long friend or decades-old neighbor without first getting government permission.</p>
      <p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) explained that the universal background check legislation will also lead to a gun registry:</p>

      <p>Biden is demanding that Majority Leader McConnell hold a vote on the gun control now. He <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1191500021062963200">tweeted</a> that it has been “250 days” since the Democrat House passed the bill and said McConnell needs to “do [his] job and bring the universal background check bill up for a vote.”</p>
