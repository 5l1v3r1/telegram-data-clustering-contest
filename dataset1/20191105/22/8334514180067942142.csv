France says troops kill a leading jihadist in the Sahel

05 Nov 2019, 22:28

PARIS (Reuters) - French troops killed one of the Sahel region’s leading jihadists on Oct. 9, France’s defense minister said on Tuesday.
Ali Maychou was the No. 2 in command of Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an umbrella group for al Qaeda-linked insurgents in West Africa’s Sahara.
Violence by Islamist militants has proliferated in the sparsely-populated Sahel in recent years, with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State using central and Northern Mali as a launch pad for attacks across the largely desert region.
