人臉識別第一案 杭州動物園刷臉入園被控侵權

05 Nov 2019, 22:30

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】人臉識別技術近年來在中國大陸被廣泛使用於對民眾的監控，引發公眾對隱私遭侵犯的擔憂。近日，浙江理工大學法學副教授郭兵把強制遊客「刷臉」入園的杭州野生動物世界告上法庭，指控該園的做法侵權、違法，危害消費者的人身和財產安全。此案日前獲法院受理，被輿論稱為中國「人臉識別第一案」。
今年10月28日，因不滿杭州野生動物世界強制遊客「刷臉」入園，浙江理工大學特聘副教授郭兵向杭州市富陽區人民法院提起了訴訟。11月1日，法院正式立案受理，此案成為中國「人臉識別第一案」。
根據起訴書，今年10月，杭州野生動物世界通知該園的年卡用戶，新的人臉識別技術已取代現有的指紋識別方法，未註冊人臉識別的用戶將無法入園參觀。同時，杭州野生動物世界還拒絕向那些不遵守新要求的用戶全額退款。而郭兵作為杭州野生動物世界的年卡用戶，不能接受園方的這項新規定，於是決定就此事向法院提起訴訟。
起訴書中表示，《中華人民共和國消費者權益保護法》第29條規定：經營者蒐集使用消費者的個人信息需要遵循合法、正當、必要的原則，且須徵得消費者同意。而杭州野生動物園未經卡持有人同意便單方面升級年卡系統，強制蒐集用戶的個人生物識別資訊等敏感數據，違反了上述「消費者保護法」。
起訴書還指出，動物園蒐集的這些消費者生物識別資訊一旦洩露，或被非法濫用，將危害消費者的人身和財產安全，後果不堪設想。
為此，郭兵尋求園方全額退還人民幣1,360元的年費並支付相關的法律費用。
《華爾街日報》引述科技專家表示，這起訴訟的結果可能會影響中國政府如何監管有關部門及企業對人臉識別技術的使用。
位於北京的科技及媒體研究公司Marbridge Consulting的董事總經理納特金(Mark Natkin)也表示，諸如人臉識別等尖端技術在中國大陸被廣泛應用，但個人、企業、政府及其它相關方，都沒有用充份的時間來考慮這些技術廣泛採用帶來的潛在負面影響。
此外，有律師指出，個資蒐集應符合「合法、正當、必要」三原則，本案料將有助於社會和相關部門反思當前沒有嚴格規定、蒐集生物辨識資料的法律界線。
實際上，就在郭兵正式向法院提出起訴杭州野生動物世界侵權的第二天（10月29日），北京市軌道交通指揮中心主任戰明輝在中國「2019年城市軌道交通運營發展論壇」上發布消息稱，北京地鐵將應用人臉識別技術實現乘客分類安檢，此舉當即引發輿論爭議。
清華大學法學院教授勞東燕為此撰文指出，人大有必要啟動立法程序對人臉識別技術的運用進行法律上的規制，防止公眾的個人信息被商業機構或公權力部門濫用。勞東燕也質疑對乘客分類採取不同的安檢措施違反了憲法的平等原則。
勞東燕在文中還說，全方位的安保使她感到自己正在從被保護的對象變成被防範的對象，她認為此舉有違現代刑事訴訟法的無罪推定原則，因為「所有人都被推定為對公共安全具有危險，需要無一例外的經受越來越嚴格的安檢。」
據了解，早在2018年10月，「人臉識別安檢設備」就已在廣州地鐵的部份車站試行。廣州地鐵和科技公司合作，乘客在廣州地鐵官方APP 上完成實名認證和人臉採集後，便可以開通「智慧安檢」功能，在地鐵站靠「刷臉」通過實名認證安檢通道。

The first case of face recognition, Hangzhou Zoo was accused of infringement

05 Nov 2019, 22:30

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Face recognition technology has been widely used in mainland China in recent years to monitor the public and raise public concerns about privacy violations. Recently, Guo Bing, an associate professor of law at Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, sued the Hangzhou Wildlife World, which forced tourists to “paint their faces” into the park, accusing the park of infringement and illegality, and endangering the personal and property safety of consumers. The case was accepted by the court a few days ago and was referred to as the ""first case of face recognition"" in China.
On October 28 this year, Guo Bing, an associate professor of Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, filed a lawsuit against the Fuyang District People's Court in Hangzhou because he was dissatisfied with the mandatory “walking face” of the Hangzhou Wildlife World. On November 1, the court officially accepted the case and the case became the first case of face recognition in China.
According to the indictment, in October this year, Hangzhou Wildlife World informed the park's annual card users that the new face recognition technology has replaced the existing fingerprint identification method, and users without registered face recognition will not be able to enter the park. At the same time, Hangzhou Wildlife World also refused to give a full refund to those who did not comply with the new requirements. As the annual card user of Hangzhou Wildlife World, Guo Bing could not accept the new regulations of the garden, so he decided to file a lawsuit against the court.
The indictment stated that Article 29 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights stipulates that: the collection of the use of consumer personal information by operators must follow the principles of lawfulness, justification and necessity, and must be approved by consumers. The Hangzhou Safari Park unilaterally upgraded the annual card system without the consent of the card holder, forcibly collecting sensitive biometric information such as the user's personal data, in violation of the above-mentioned ""Consumer Protection Law.""
The indictment also pointed out that once the consumer biometric information collected by the zoo is leaked or illegally abused, it will endanger the safety of the person and property of the consumer, and the consequences are unimaginable.
To this end, Guo Bing sought the park to fully refund the annual fee of RMB 1,360 and pay the relevant legal fees.
The Wall Street Journal quoted technology experts as saying that the outcome of the lawsuit may affect how the Chinese government regulates the use of face recognition technology by relevant departments and companies.
Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a technology and media research firm based in Beijing, also said that cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition are widely used in mainland China, but individuals, businesses, governments and other interested parties There is not enough time to consider the potential negative effects of the widespread adoption of these technologies.
In addition, some lawyers pointed out that the collection of personal assets should conform to the three principles of “legitimate, just and necessary”. This case is expected to help the society and relevant departments to reflect on the legal boundaries that are not strictly regulated and collect biometric data.
In fact, just after Guo Bing officially filed a lawsuit against the court for the infringement of the wildlife world in Hangzhou (October 29), the director of the Beijing Rail Transit Command Center, Zhan Minghui, was on the ""2019 Urban Rail Transit Operation Development Forum"" in China. According to the release of the news, the Beijing Metro will use face recognition technology to achieve passenger classification security, which immediately triggered public opinion disputes.
Liaohua University's law school professor Lao Dongyan pointed out that it is necessary for the NPC to initiate a legislative process to legally regulate the use of face recognition technology to prevent public personal information from being abused by commercial organizations or public authorities. Lao Dongyan also questioned that different security measures for passenger classification violated the constitutional equality principle.
Lao Dongyan also said in the article that all-round security made her feel that she was changing from being protected to being prevented. She believed that this was contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence in modern criminal procedure law, because ""everyone is presumed In order to be dangerous to public safety, it is necessary to undergo more and more strict security inspections without exception.""
It is understood that as early as October 2018, the ""Face Recognition Security Equipment"" has been piloted at some stations of the Guangzhou Metro. Guangzhou Metro and technology company cooperation, passengers in the Guangzhou Metro official APP to complete the real-name certification and face collection, you can open the ""Smart Security"" function, in the subway station by ""brush face"" through the real-name certification security inspection channel.
