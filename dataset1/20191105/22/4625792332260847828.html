      <h1>'A bunch of B.S.': Lindsey Graham refuses to read Ukraine transcripts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:19:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Pearce</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham says he will not read newly released transcripts of private testimony given by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sondland-changes-testimony-admits-to-quid-pro-quo-with-ukraine">Gordon Sondland</a> and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-us-ambassador-to-the-eu-gordon-sondland-secret-closed-door-testimony">Sondland</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-former-us-special-envoy-to-ukraine-kurt-volker-secret-closed-door-testimony">Volker</a> testified in a closed session to House lawmakers in the Democrat-driven impeachment investigation against President Trump. The House <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">passed</a> a resolution approving the impeachment proceedings and authorizing the release of transcripts of the closed-door testimony on Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>"I've written the whole process off ... I think this is a bunch of B.S." said Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The South Carolina Republican also said he would not be reading transcripts of the official's testimonies.</p>

      <p>The release of Sondland and Volker's testimony <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-committees-release-first-transcripts-from-closed-door-impeachment-hearings">follows</a> the Monday release of testimony given by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's former senior adviser Michael McKinley and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>Democrats are pursuing an impeachment investigation into Trump based on allegations the president attempted to use U.S. military aid to Ukraine to secure an investigation by the Ukrainian government into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden for political gain. The proceedings launched after a whistleblower filed an anonymous complaint alleging the agreement was made in a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">transcript</a> of the phone call after securing Zelensky's approval to do so. Graham has repeatedly defended Trump against the allegations at the root of the impeachment process, referring back to the transcript of the phone call to do so.</p>
