      <p>Stomach-churning photographs show the mountains of rubbish and rat carcasses that were discovered in the garden of two brothers who set up an illegal dump.</p>
      <p>Raymond Murray, 61, and Ian Murray, 54, were found to have 500 rats at their home as a result of their business in Kinmel Bay, Conwy, in Wales.</p>
      <p>And a clean-up operation cost £59,000 and saw more than 123 tonnes removed from their home.</p>
      <p>Between 400 and 500 rats were also killed using 156 rat traps - the average amount used across the county in a month.</p>
      <p>Today, a court heard the infestation had caused a "real risk to health" to neighbours, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/rats-rubbish-kinmel-bay-conwy-17205482">Wales Online.</a></p>

      <p>A nearby caravan park also found dead rats in its awnings and live rodents running around the children’s play area.</p>
      <p>The play area had to be closed and disinfected, while refunds were given to customers.</p>
      <p>During an earlier hearing, the court was told that the brothers began a waste collecting business when they lost a previous taxi business and ran into financial difficulties.</p>

      <p>When it was found to be uneconomical to take the rubbish to a tip, the pair began sorting it out at their home and the situation grew "out of hand".</p>
      <p>When officers visited the home in May, hundreds of bin bags of domestic waste were found in the garden, including mattresses, furniture, car parts and a caravan.</p>
      <p>There was also evidence of rat burrows and bin bags ripped open by the rodents.</p>

      <p>In January, both brothers were handed 10-month prison sentences suspended for two years  after pleading guilty to acting without an environment permit. </p>
      <p>Today it was found the brothers made £72,637 from their illegal business.</p>
      <p>During the Proceeds of Crime Act hearing, Natural Resources Wales prosecutor Christopher Stables said the amount available for confiscation totalled £37,153 from Raymond Murray and £30,413 from his brother.</p>

      <p>Mr Stables also asked the cost of the clean-up operation be repaid.</p>
      <p>Judge Niclas Parry ordered the defendants to pay £67,566 within three months or serve 12 months in prison.</p>
      <p>He also told the pair to place their house for sale within a week to cover the shortfall.</p>
