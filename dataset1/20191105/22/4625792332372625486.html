      <h1>Dow and Nasdaq close at new highs for second day straight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:09:04+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Melissa Quinn</a></address>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq closed at record highs for the second straight day Tuesday amid growing optimism about the trade negotiations between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>The Dow ended up 30 points, or 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.48 points, or 0.02%. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.1% Tuesday after also closing at a record high Monday.</p>
      <p>The rally follows comments from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that negotiations between the U.S. and China over a phase one trade deal are progressing.</p>
      <p>“I’m reasonably optimistic we can get something done and move forward toward a completion of phase one,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>The agreement was supposed to be signed at this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Chile, but the forum was canceled amid protests in the country. Representatives from the U.S. and China are searching for a new location, and the White House said last week it expects the deal to be signed within the same time frame.</p>
      <p>But before the partial trade pact can be signed, Beijing said it wants the president to lift tariffs on Chinese products. China is urging the U.S. to cancel the 15% tariffs that hit $112 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 1 and cancel a forthcoming round of 15% duties scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>Trump already called off a planned tariff increase on Oct. 15.</p>
      <p>The headway on trade talks lifted the Dow to an all-time high Monday after the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/s-p-500-nasdaq-close-at-record-highs-on-heels-of-strong-jobs-report"><u>closed at record levels</u></a> Friday following <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-economy-added-128k-jobs-in-october"><u>stronger-than-expected jobs gains</u></a> in October.</p>
