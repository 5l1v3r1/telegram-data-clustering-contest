      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A man claiming to be a Secret Service special agent was arrested Monday night after he grabbed a woman by the arm on State Street and ordered her to put her phone down and walk down the street, according to an incident report.</p>
      <p>Police said 42-year-old D'Andre White approached a 21-year-old woman on State Street at 7:55 p.m. According to the report, White lifted up his jacket at one point, which caused the victim to think he might have had a gun. The woman then put her phone on the ground and stood next to it.</p>
      <p>A nearby couple saw what was happening and intervened. A man stepped in between White and the victim while a woman escorted the victim away after she grabbed her phone, police said.</p>
      <p>The incident report said the incident was called in as an armed robbery, so a Violent Crime Unit detective immediately searched surveillance footage in the area. The detective found White and gave his description to nearby officers who found and arrested him.</p>
      <p>White did not have a weapon on him, and he declined to talk about the incident. He was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and a probation violation.</p>
