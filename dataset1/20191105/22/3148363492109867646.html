      <h1>Trump Admin Warns Against Wall Restrictions in Funding Bill | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>The White House warned Democrats not to include provisions in a stop-gap government funding measure that would restrict the Trump administration’s ability to build a wall on the southern border.</h2>

      <p>The White House Office of Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/469066-white-house-warns-against-including-wall-restrictions-in-stopgap-bill">said</a> Tuesday that the Trump administration could consider another stop-gap continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government past November 21 “as long as it does not restrict authorities or abilities to pursue his [Trump’s] policy priorities, including wall construction.”</p>
      <p>“We’re heartened to have continuing conversations with appropriate parties in Congress on the regular order spending bills, as well as a continuing resolution,” Ueland said before a closed-door Senate GOP lunch.</p>
      <p>Congress will either have to pass its 12 appropriations bills or another CR before November 21 to avoid another government shutdown.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has asked to lift a restriction, which was included in the current CR, that places a limitation that requires any border wall funding to be focused solely on the Rio Grande Valley region.</p>
      <p>Ueland reportedly dodged reporters’ questions over whether the administration would need the restriction lifted as part of agreeing to another CR.</p>
      <p>President Trump declared a national emergency in the wake of Congress’ failure to pass an appropriations bill with a significant amount of border wall funding. The national emergency allows Trump to reappropriate defense spending towards building a wall along the southern border, thus fulfilling his foremost campaign promise.</p>
      <p>Democrats and some Republicans have moved to terminate Trump’s national emergency to build the wall in September. In September, 11 Senate Republicans <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/25/eleven-senate-republicans-vote-end-trumps-national-emergency/">voted</a> with Democrats to terminate the national emergency.</p>
      <p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who is up for reelection in 2020, said that the vote to terminate the national emergency is not about “whether you’re for or against a border wall.”</p>
