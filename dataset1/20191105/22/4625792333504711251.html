      <h1>'God already spoke to me': Trump spiritual adviser predicts visions for those who give money to her ministry</h1>

      <p>Paula White, President Trump's personal spiritual adviser, and recent addition to his administration told the congregation at a service over the weekend that God would provide guidance to those who donate to her ministry.</p>
      <p>"I want you to hear from God. God already spoke to me," White <a href="https://vimeo.com/369826421">said</a> Sunday evening during a live-streamed sermon. "You're going to write your checks to Paula White ministry because this is power night."</p>
      <p>White said "power night" at the church was different than her normal "City of Destiny" service, and that she was allowing the congregation a special chance to tithe. "Every single person gets something significant," she said after explaining the various ways people could pay.</p>

      <p>She then began praying and asked God to "speak with clarity" for those building an altar on which they would sacrifice their funds to God. "That altar, maybe that's a sacrifice of $50 or $100. Maybe it's $1,000," she said.</p>
      <p>White said later in her prayer that what she was proposing was not "buying a miracle" but "simply being obedient," adding, "If God tells you to give $12 and 99 cents, do it."</p>
      <p>The megachurch leader <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/revealed-trump-wanted-to-build-a-mega-church">told the <i>Washington Examiner</i></a> <i/>on <i/>Friday that Trump wanted to build a megachurch with her in 2006. White has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/paula-white-trump.html">joined</a> the administration as a part of the Office of Public Liaison, where she will be tasked with working on the administration's Faith and Opportunity Initiative.</p>
