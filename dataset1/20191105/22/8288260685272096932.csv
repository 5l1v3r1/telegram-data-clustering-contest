Aston Villa have just been nominated for this award - but they won't want to win it!
Aston Villa latest news | This weird AVFC story stretches back to May
05 Nov 2019, 22:33 by Shane Ireland, Ben Husband, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/
For one night back in May, Birmingham was claret and blue.
Or at least the city's library was.
To celebrate Aston Villa's promotion to the Premier League, the Birmingham Library was lit up in the famous colours of Dean Smith's side.
Villa didn't hold a parade after beating Derby County but on the evening of the brilliant Wembley win, the city centre library said they would light up the Birmingham night sky and the club's social media team posted an image to pay tribute to that.



But some eagle eyed observers noticed something a little peculiar about the image posted.
In the bottom left of the image is a Christmas tree, Birmingham is either six months out of the loop or someone may have used the wrong picture.
At the time there was some hilarious feedback to the post.
@wozaboxa: Nice of the library to stick out the Christmas trees early too!
@simonstewart75: Christmas trees?
@nocky1982: Just out of interest, why is there a Christmas Tree?
@astonjo7: Merry Christmas to you all!

Villa themselves, however, may well disagree!
