      <h1>AT&amp;T gets a friendly fine from the FTC over ‘unlimited’ plan throttling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:00:52+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/tristangreen/" target="_blank">Tristan Greene</a></address>
      <p>The FTC today announced it had settled a lawsuit with AT&amp;T over misleading marketing concerning the company’s “unlimited” data plans and would issue a $60 million fine.</p>
      <p>The fine comes five years after the suit was brought forth by FTC chairpersons who, in 2014, determined that AT&amp;T had likely begun the practice of throttling data on customers’ “unlimited” plans as far back 2011. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2014/10/ftc-sues-att-limiting-unlimited-data">The suit</a> alleges that all customers on the specific plan(s) were subject to this practice upon reaching a specific usage threshold.</p>
      <p>AT&amp;T, in reference to the fine, gave the following statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949850/att-fine-unlimited-data-plan-fake-throttling">The Verge</a> earlier today:</p>
      <blockquote>Even though it has been years since we applied this network management tool in the way described by the FTC, we believe this is in the best interests of consumers.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s no surprise that AT&amp;T appears to have no objection to the $60 million fine. Let’s put that number into perspective. AT&amp;T makes about $150 billion (more or less, annual average) in revenue, which means the fine is approximately 0.04 percent of its revenue. So, let’s say AT&amp;T was a person who made $50,000 in salary a year and they’d just been fined 0.04 percent. According to the calculator at <a href="http://www.alcula.com/calculators/finance/percentage-calculator/">Alcula</a>, that’s a $20 fine. Do with that information what you will.</p>
      <p>It’s obvious that AT&amp;T‘s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution">political lobbying</a> has paid for itself several times over as it continues to receive cream-puff fines from friendly entities in the US government, but there’s more than just cash at stake here. This little pile-on from the FCC (who previously fined AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/att-mobility-faces-100m-fine-misleading-consumers-0">$100 million</a> (soo.. around $35?) and the FTC makes it <i>look</i> like AT&amp;T is paying its comeuppance for its <i>past </i>practices of throttling customers.</p>
      <p>It also <i>looks</i> like the FTC is making good on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html">FCC’s promise</a> that regulation would continue after net neutrality was repealed. But, a tickle-on-the-wrist in fines and the appearance of enforcement are far different things than ordering AT&amp;T to cease throttling its customers and lying about it.</p>
      <p>Now that AT&amp;T‘s legal woes concerning <i>allegations</i> of throttling have been settled and net neutrality is a thing of the past, it’s free to continue doing business as usual. </p>
