NTSB avoiding speculation about maneuvers before New Bedford plane crash
05 Nov 2019, 22:35 by Scott McDonnell














NEW BEDFORD, Mass. - National Transportation Safety Board investigators have been in New Bedford for nearly 24 hours as they look into the cause of a crash that killed a 74-year-old pilot.
Heavy rain wasn't making it any easier for investigators to get some answers Tuesday evening. 
Witnesses have different opinions on what that plane was doing in the sky before it crashed and the NTSB warned people to be careful when it comes to speculation about that plane doing aerobic circles before it crashed. 
Onlookers lined up in New Bedford's Rural Cemetery to catch a view of the mangled metal left behind. 
The pilot, Paul Vidal, took off in his Cessna 150 from the local airport around four miles away.
A passionate and experienced pilot, his wife described him as careful in the cockpit and someone who would take the lives of others into consideration if he had any problems in the sky.



Tuesday afternoon, the NTSB answered questions about any issues he could have run into that would cause him to crash.
""We spoke to witnesses at the airport who said he was cheerful and ready to fly, and he took about 10 minutes doing preflight,"" NTSB Air Safety Investigator Lynn Spencer said. 
Funerals were set to go on as planned at Rural Cemetery, as the part of the property where the plan crashed is in an older section.
There is a lot of police tape up, so visiting grave sites in that area is off limits until the NTSB finishes and the plane wreckage is removed.
There has been a steady line of cars that have come through the cemetery.



New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell sent Boston 25 News the following statement Tuesday: 
""I wish to express my condolences to the family of Paul Vidal, the pilot of the plane that crashed in Rural Cemetery yesterday.  Mr. Vidal was a well-known and respected member of Greater New Bedford's recreational aviation community for many years, where his loss is being felt today. I am profoundly relieved that the crash did not result in a much larger disaster. Despite its name, Rural Cemetery sits in the middle of the city, surrounded by densely populated neighborhoods where thousands of residents live. It is readily imaginable that under slightly different circumstances the crash could have taken lives on the ground.             I am also grateful to the many neighbors who promptly reported the incident to authorities, and for their cooperation with the response effort.  I commend the New Bedford Police, Fire, EMS and Emergency Management personnel, along with the state and federal investigators, for their unhesitant and deliberate management of the crash scene.  As awful of an event as it was, the public can have confidence that its officials reacted with the utmost skill in the moment.""— Mayor Jon Mitchell
