      <p>“Please keep Det. DelRio and his family in your prayers along with this department and this community,” Biehl said.</p>
      <p>Detectives knocked and announced themselves as law enforcement officers before entering a home on Ruskin Rd. just before 7 p.m. on Monday, Dayton police said, adding that DelRio was shot as he started to go down basement stairs. He was rushed to a local hospital by a fellow officer due to the severity of the injuries, police tweeted.</p>
      <p>No other injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Police said four adults and one juvenile were “secured at the scene” and that the adults are being held on felony drug charges.</p>
      <p>Three weapons, each with 30-round magazines, were recovered at the scene, as well as a significant amount of cash, fentanyl and marijuana, investigators said.</p>

      <p>Between July and October, the DEA’s Dayton resident office reportedly conducted an investigation on a Dayton fentanyl operation leading them to believe that Goddard was a supplier. Police conducted a search warrant on the home on Monday night and that is when DelRio was shot.</p>
