      <p>MILWAUKEE (AP) - Milwaukee police say a 25-year-old man is in custody in this week's hit-and-run that injured two children.</p>
      <p>Police say the man turned himself in Tuesday afternoon. Milwaukee police have recovered the suspected vehicle.</p>
      <p>The children, believed to be around ages 4 and 6, were struck around 4:30 p.m. Monday. The children were taken to a hospital, where the 4-year-old was being treated for minor injuries and the 6-year-old for serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Police say charges will be presented in the prosecutor's office in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The crash follows a hit-and-run crash last month in north Milwaukee that killed two young sisters and injured their 10-year-old cousin. A 19-year-old man is charged in that case.</p>
