      <h2>Conservative leader chooses the West Midlands for election launch but it comes as he faces a row over Jacob Rees-Mogg's Grenfell comments</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson is launching his general election campaign in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by his Cabinet, as he kicks off the official battle for Number 10 with a dig at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson will insist that only he can "get Brexit done", while Labour plans "dither and delay" by holding a second Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>And he will insist that once the UK is out of the EU, a Conservative government will get on with "delivering on the public’s priorities of our NHS, crime and the cost of living."</p>
      <p>Parliament held its last pre-election debate on Tuesday night and voting takes place on December 12.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson will head to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen before returning to Downing Street to announce the formal start of the General Election.</p>
      <p>He will then hold his first election rally in the West Midlands - and insist that he never wanted to hold a poll at all.</p>
      <p>Instead, he will argue that the only way to deliver Brexit is to elect a new Parliament with new MPs.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson will say: "I don’t want an election. No prime minister wants an early election, especially not in December.</p>
      <p>"But as things stand we simply have no choice – because it is only by getting Brexit done in the next few weeks that we can focus on all the priorities of the British people.’"</p>
      <p>He will claim Labour would hold two referendums if it wins power, one on Brexit and the other on Scottish independence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Johnson will say: "The alternative is clear - Jeremy Corbyn and his two favourite advisers, Dither and Delay, turning 2020 into the year of two miserable referendums, one on the EU, and another on Scotland."</p>
      <p>Labour does plan to hold another Brexit referendum. It does not support a second referendum on Scottish independence, but says it would be wrong to refuse to hold one if the Scottish government and assembly call for one.</p>
      <p>Tories are targeting West Midlands seats including Dudley North, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Warwick and Leamington and Wolverhampton South West. They also hope they could gain Birmingham Northfield from Labour.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, the Tory campaign was overshadowed on Tuesday night by anger over comments made by Cabinet Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said victims of the Grenfell fire should have used "common sense" and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block.</p>
      <p>Mr Rees-Mogg said on LBC on Monday: "I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building.</p>
      <p>"It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didn't happen."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Later, Mr Rees-Mogg said: "I profoundly apologise."</p>
      <p>Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen the made things worse by telling a radio interviewer that Jacob Rees-Mogg "would have made a better decision than the authority figures" who advised residents to stay in their flats, and suggested this was because Mr Rees-Mogg was "very clever".</p>
