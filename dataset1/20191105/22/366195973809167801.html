      <p>There has been much talk about snitching in the hip hop community throughout 2019. The <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tekashi-6ix9ine/profile/">Tekashi 6ix9ine</a> case has taken center stage as an entire crew has been dismantled after the rapper turned into a government informant. Quite a few songs have mentioned 6ix9ine's name and his "snitch" label, and it seems as if the topic is still popular because on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Papoose/profile">Papoose</a> dropped a new single titled "Big Snitch."</p>
      <p>The single comes on the heels of two projects Papoose has released this year. The New York rapper shared his studio album <i>Underrated</i> in mid-February and later released his mixtape <i>Food For Thought </i>at the end of July. Aside from holding things down in the studio, Papoose also has also shown face on the reality television front on <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop New York</i> alongside his rap star wife, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/remyma/profile">Remy Ma</a>. Check out the Brooklyn rapper's latest and let us know what you think.</p>
