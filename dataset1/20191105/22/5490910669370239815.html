      <p>Olivia Newton-John’s iconic “Grease” leather pants have found a new owner.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/spanx/">Spanx</a> founder Sara Blakely snapped up the costume, which Newton-John wore when she played the role of Sandy in the 1978 film, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/olivia-newton-john-grease-sandy-leather-costume-auction-1203341285/">at an auction the actress participated in to support her Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre</a>. Blakely paid $162,000 for the leather pants.</p>
      <p>“I have been the biggest fan of Olivia since I was a little girl, since ‘Grease’ came out,” Blakely said in an interview on “CBS This Morning” on Tuesday. “My friend called me two days before the auction. I didn’t know it was happening and she said, ‘Sara, they’re putting the pants up, the outfit for charity,’ and I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’ve got to try to get these.’”</p>

      <p>She also purchased Newton-John’s custom “Pink Ladies” jacket made by the film’s cast and crew.</p>
      <p>Blakely’s admiration for Newton-John goes further than being a fan of “Grease.” She enlisted the actress to sing at her wedding in 2008 and she credits Newton-John as the inspiration behind <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-skims-cotton-collection-debuts-1203344515/">Spanx</a>’s faux leather leggings.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to frame [the leather pants] and hang them at Spanx,” Blakely continued. “We have black faux leather leggings and they have become a cult following and they’re inspired off of Olivia’s pants. She is the OG of black leggings. I had to own them as the Spanx founder.”</p>
      <p>Newton-John worked with Julien’s Auctions to sell 500 of her costumes, accessories and personal items to benefit her charity. She also auctioned off the original script for “Grease,” the Fifties-inspired pink lace gown she wore to the film’s premiere and her custom, thigh-high suede Western boots and Missoni knit harem pants from the 1980 fantasy film, “Xanadu,” among other items.</p>
