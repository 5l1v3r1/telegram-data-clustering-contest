        <b>The general secretary and three other members have stepped down from the Jahangirnagar University Teachers’ Association following an attack on teachers and students demonstrating for the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Professor Farzana Islam.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The four are General Secretary Prof Md Sohel Rana, Treasurer Prof Monwar Hossain Tuhin, and executive members Prof Mahbub Kabir and Prof Sayeed Ferdous.</p>
      <p>They made the announcement in a statement on Tuesday evening after the attack allegedly by Bangladesh Chhatra League activists on the campus in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>The authorities shut the university down for indefinite period after the incident.</p>

      <p>“Both teachers and students were insulted and injured in the attack. I can’t do anything more than calling it unfortunate. We can’t bring a motion of condemnation or seek justice. Then how can we perform our duty in the teachers’ association?” Sohel Rana asked.</p>
      <p>He said the resignation letters would be sent to the association’s President Ajit Kumar Majumder later in the night.</p>
      <p>“We are shocked at the partial role played by the association,” he said.</p>
