      <h1>Mohamed Elyounoussi responds to Celtic transfer talk as Southampton loan star eyes trophies</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian winger has made a huge instant impact with the champions, scoring seven goals in 10 games.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:29:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Swan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/craig-swan/</a></address>
      <p>Loan star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-elyounoussi">Mohamed Elyounoussi</a> has put his future transfer plans on hold to focus on gaining success for Celtic.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian international has made a blistering start to his spell at Parkhead with seven goals in 10 games after joining on a year-long deal from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a>.</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi’s immediate impact has some <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans hoping a permanent arrangement may come in the future for the attacker.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old cost Saints £16 million and a hefty personal package when signing from FC Basle 17 months ago, but he was well out of the picture on England’s south coast before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> made his move just prior to the close of the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi is savouring life in Glasgow and heads for Thurday night’s Europa League crunch against Lazio in Rome as a key man.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But he says any long-term thoughts about his future are firmly on the back burner as he concentrates on winning medals and performing well in Europe for the champions.</p>
      <p>He said: “I haven’t thought about what is going to happen in the future. All I think about is what is going to happen in the next training session and then the next game. I never look too far ahead.</p>

      <p>“When the season is finished I will sit down and look at all of my options, but right now I am just happy to be here and playing for Celtic.</p>
      <p>“I think I need to focus on the here and now and not the future or the past.</p>
      <p>“After everything I have been through in the last 12 months and not playing at Southampton, it makes me appreciate what I have even more. It makes winning semi-finals and playing in Europe even more special for me.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I really appreciate how often the gaffer has played me since I have arrived and that belief he has in me. I am happy to repay him by scoring some goals and having some assists.</p>
      <p>“I think over the next few months I can get even better. I think with the coaches we have here then I am confident I can get stronger. I came here to get some minutes and to try to help the team win some silverware.”</p>
