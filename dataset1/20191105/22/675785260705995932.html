      <h1>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be at front of the queue of Liverpool stars fighting for Club World Cup spot</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool moved within one step of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage with a 2-1 win over Genk on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:39:54+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>The battle for places has started, the scramble for selection is underway.</p>
      <p>A first class seat on the big bird to the warmth of Doha? Or a spot on the bus to the chill of Birmingham?</p>
      <p>A Tuesday night in a Midlands suburb? Or a week of luxury in Qatar?</p>
      <p>The prospect of a Club World Cup winners’ medal? Or a slog in the cold for a place in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup?</p>
      <p>There are plenty of names already on the boarding passes to the Arabian Gulf.</p>
      <p>The A-listers will be there, surely. You know who they are.</p>

      <p>But the likes of Joe Gomez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita and even Divock Origi will be wondering if they will be going with the kids down the M6 or with the elite to one of FIFA’s junkets.</p>
      <p>It is a farcical situation, of course.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have come up with a convincing explanation for why they felt this was the best option - involving the possibility of FA Cup replays and other such unknowns - but it just does not feel right.</p>
      <p>It is happening, though, and it will be fascinating to see how it works out.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp does have the option of fielding players against Aston Villa on the evening of Tuesday, December 17 and then flying them out to Qatar.</p>

      <p>If Liverpool win their Club World Cup semi-final on the Wednesday, the final is not until the Saturday.</p>
      <p>But if you are senior player and not in the original party for Doha, it will be a blow to the ego.</p>
      <p>You can guess where Oxlade-Chamberlain will want to be.</p>
      <p>And you know for certain where he really wants to be long-term… in a more prominent role in this Liverpool squad.</p>
      <p>There have been signs in recent weeks - certainly from the bench at Villa Park on Saturday - that he could soon be playing a more influential part.</p>

      <p>And those signs were clearly visible again.</p>
      <p>Klopp might well have reservations about Oxlade-Chamberlain’s understanding of his system and maybe even about his work-rate.</p>
      <p>But there is no doubting his ingenuity and his eye for goal when played in a more advanced role.</p>
      <p>He certainly looked a character full of confidence even if it was in a pedestrian-paced contest.</p>
      <p>And he certainly looked a player who will believe he should be at a Club World Cup rather than a Carabao kickabout come December.</p>
