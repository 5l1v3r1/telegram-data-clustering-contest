Marekani imeanza rasmi mchakato wa kujitoa kwenye mkataba wa Paris kuhusu tabianchi. Barua hiyo ilikuwa ikisubiriwa tangu mwaka 2017, lakini haingeweza kutumwa mapema, kwani hakuna nchi ambayo ingeweza kujitoa kabla ya maadhimisho ya kumbukumbu ya miaka mitatu tangu kuanza kutumika mkataba huo Novemba 4, 2016.
Rais wa Marekani Donald Trump alikuwa mpinzani mkubwa wa makubaliano hayo wakati alipokuwa anawania kiti cha urais, na utawala wake umekuwa ukifanya kila unaloliweza kubadilisha sheria za mazingira, ukisema zinazuwia biashara na kutoa kwa nchi nyingine nguvu ya ushindani.
Karibu mataifa 200 yalisaini mkataba huo wa mazingira ambapo kila nchi inatoa malengo yake ya kupunguza utoaji wa hewa chafu inayosababisha na mabadiliko ya tabianchi.
Donald Trump ametangaza nia yake ya kujitoa kwenye mkataba huo, ambao unalenga kupunguza uzalishaji wa gesi chafu.
""Leo, Marekani inaanza mchakato wa kujiotoa kwenye mkataba wa Paris. Kwa mujibu wa masharti ya mkataba huo, Marekani imesahihisha rasmi kwenye Umoja wa Mataifa uamuzi wake wa kujitoa kwenye mkataba huo. Mchakato huo utakamilika mwaka mmoja baada ya ya uamuzi huo kusahihishwa, "" Waziri wa Mambo ya Njee wa Marekani Mike Pompeo amesema katika taarifa.
Taarifa ya Pompeo ilielezea kuhusu kile alichokiita ""mzigo usio wa haki wa kiuchumi uliowekwa kwa wafanyakazi wa Marekani, biashara, na walipa kodi, kwa ahadi za Marekani zilizotolewa chini ya makubaliano hayo"".

05 Nov 2019, 16:19 by RFI

The US government has submitted its letter to the United Nations and formally corrected its decision to withdraw from the Charter, confirming its commitment.

The United States has officially begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate. The letter had been pending since 2017, but it could not be sent in advance, as no country could surrender before the three-year anniversary of the convention on November 4, 2016.
US President Donald Trump was a staunch opponent of the agreement while he was running for the presidency, and his administration has been doing everything it can to change environmental laws, saying they are blocking trade and giving other countries a competitive advantage.
Nearly 200 nations have signed an environmental agreement in which each country sets out its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Donald Trump has announced his intention to withdraw from the treaty, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
""Today, the United States is beginning the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the treaty, the United States has officially ratified the United Nations decision to withdraw from the treaty. US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Pompeo's statement elaborated on what he called ""an unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers, on American promises made under the agreement"".
