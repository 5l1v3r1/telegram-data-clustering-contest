      <h1>Revealed: North Ayrshire's shocking drugs death toll for 2019</h1>
      <h2>The tragic number of suspected drug-related deaths emerged in a recent Integration Joint Board meeting, which oversees health and social care.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:11:09+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Irvine Herald, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/irvine-herald/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>A shocking 34 people have reportedly died after taking drugs in North Ayrshire this year. </p>
      <p>The tragic number of suspected drug-related deaths in 2019 emerged in a recent Integration Joint Board meeting, which oversees health and social care.</p>
      <p>Now new funding will be put up to help tackle the problem.</p>
      <p>In North Ayrshire, the Irvine and the Three Towns localities have a higher risk of people losing their lives after taking illegal substances.</p>
      <p>Integration Joint Board Chair Councillor Robert Foster described the drug deaths as a “public health problem”.</p>
      <p>The Labour councillor said: “We all have a duty to work together to stop these tragic deaths from occurring.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>North Ayrshire Alcohol and Drug Partnership chair Paul Main said: “When the National Records for Scotland publish in July 2020 I would anticipate that the number of drug deaths in North Ayrshire will have increased. I don’t take any pride in saying that.” </p>
      <p>He said there are no “easy” or “quick” answers and solutions to the issue would require strength of leadership and a “collaboration that probably doesn’t exist anywhere in Scotland just now”.</p>

      <p>A drug death prevention group has been set up.  There is a push to supply more of the life-saving injection Naloxone, which can reverse heroin and other opioids overdoses. Over the last year 220 of the kits were handed out. At least 13 lives have been saved. </p>
      <p>Another plan includes addicts getting access to clean needles at clinics and pharmacies. Regular drug screening and increased availability of opiate substitution therapy are also on the agenda.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Last year there were 38 drug deaths in the area and North Ayrshire Council has already declared a drugs death emergency.</p>
      <p>At a meeting last month Councillor Louise McPhater called for safe rooms and for possession of illegal substances to be decriminalised.</p>
      <p>She said she lost her sister to drug addiction in 2011 and added: “I don’t want to go to another funeral of a 17-year-old or a 25-year-old or a 31-year-old and I don’t want to visit a newborn baby born with an addiction.</p>
      <p>“There is great work going on but we need to look at this in a different way.”</p>
      <p>A report presented to the integration joint board said: “The Alcohol and Drug Partnership have identified £50,000 to encourage and attract innovative suggestions and proposals from the communities of Irvine and the Three Towns locality.”</p>
