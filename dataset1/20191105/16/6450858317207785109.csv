2018 was a great year for the Switch, with strong exclusives including Pokemon Let's Go and Super Smash Bros Ultimate coming to market. Nintendo’s gaming device - half portable, half home console - continues to blow away sales expectations, and it's showing no signs of slowing down in 2019. In fact, the release of the Switch Lite means Nintendo's line-up is stronger than ever! 
Still hugely popular and one of the most sought-after consoles at the moment, deals are tricky to find and some aren't quite as good as they first appear to be.
However, you can find some great Switch (and Switch Lite!) deals if you know where to look, both on the console itself and on the games you’ll want to play on it. Here at Tech Advisor, our experts are constantly scouring the web for the best Nintendo Switch prices, bundles and game discounts available, so if and when there are any you will find them right here on this page.

If  you have an Amazon Prime membership, you can get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online for free, which would cost £17.99 otherwise.
Cheap Switch prices: What to look for
There’s some bad news to get out of the way first: realistically, you probably shouldn’t get your hopes up for massive savings on the Switch. Blame the console’s popularity for that - people are still buying it in droves at full price, so retailers really don’t have much reason to slash prices in order to move stock.
Still, there are sure to be some discounts around if you know where to look. Not many stores tend to cut prices on the Switch itself - at least not by more than £10 or £20 - but keep an eye out for good bundles, which offer the console alongside a game or extra accessories. Switch games can cost £40 or more, so the saving overall if you buy a bundle can be much more than a £10 saving on the Switch on its own, for example.
And even if you don’t want all of the games in the bundle, you could always sell or trade-in those games afterwards. We have some tips on how and where to do that here.
There are plenty of brilliant Switch games available, but our pick of the best include Pokemon Let's Go! and Super Smash Bros Ultimate so deals on Switch bundles that include those are among the best. Check out our round-up of the best Nintendo Switch games for more.
For people who already own a Switch, you’ll find some discounts on individual games, too.
Accessories might be a better bet though - the pricing of extra controllers was one of the big gripes a lot of people had with the console at launch, so we've seen a offers trying to shift stock of controllers and other accessories including carry cases.
Also, remember that the Switch uses microSD cards for expandable storage, and USB-C for power - there are loads of great offers on memory cards and portable power banks, so we'd definitely recommend looking now if you're thinking of expanding your storage or grabbing a battery pack.
