The grieving family of nine people gunned down by cartel gunman have spoken about the horror that claimed the lives of their loved ones.
Three American mothers and six gunmen from a Mormon community were ambushed by gang members.
The victims, who belonged to the LeBaron family, were attacked roughly eight miles apart in the Mexican border state of Sonora on Monday while traveling in a convoy of three SUVs.
Nine of the LeBaron family members, who have ties to Utah, were slaughtered in the massacre and one child was still missing.

On social media one family member said that gunmen opened fire on one child running away while others burned to death inside a car that was torched.
Six children were wounded in the attack and five have since been transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona.
Other young children managed to escape and hide by the roadside while one of the mothers was shot in the chest as she put her hands up to surrender.
Relatives fear some of the victims may have been raped.

The relatives say her car had broken down when gunmen opened fire. They set her car ablaze which caused the petrol tank to explode.
A video posted on social media showed the charred and smoking remains of the vehicle riddled with bullet holes.
A male voice can be heard in the clip sayng: ""This is for the record. Nita and four of my grandchildren are burnt and shot up.""

""Women and children were massacred, burnt alive. Mothers were screaming for the fire to stop,"" he said.

The State's attorney general's office confirmed officials from Chihuahua had been sent to the area to assist.
Sonora Governor Claudia Pavlovich Arellano said on Twitter her office was collaborating with the investigation.
""As a mother, I feel angry, scorn and a profound pain for the cowardly events in the mountains between Sonora and Chihuahua,"" she said.
""I don't know what type of monsters would dare to hurt women and children.
As governor, you have all my collaboration so that this doesn't remain unpunished and the responsible parties pay.”
