      <p>We tried this out a few weeks ago with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KidCudi/profile">Kid Cudi</a> and <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kid-cudi-track-bracket-finals-day-n-night-vs-soundtrack-2-my-life-news.92985.html">your fan-voted results determined that "Soundtrack 2 My Life" is your favorite song of all-time from the Ohio-born icon</a>. The cult-favourite pick had us thinking; who else should we compile a track bracket for? Since you guys had been participating strongly in our Instagram stories, voting on a daily basis for your picks, we went with an obvious choice for the next installation. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-track-bracket-vote-for-drizzys-best-song-ever-news.94837.html">Yesterday, we kicked off the official HNHH Drake Track Bracket</a>. Of course, the world-renowned recording artist has too many hits for us to include on the banner. However, we tried our best and came through with thirty-two songs this time around.</p>

      <p>The first round is closed and now, the decisions start to get more and more intense. In a few days, we'll be crowning the winner but until then, you've got some hard dilemmas to consider. There is still a healthy selection of songs from throughout all of <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Drake/profile">Drake</a>'s past eras. This round, we've got "0-100" going up against "Marvins Room", "Tuscan Leather" facing "HYFR" and "Worst Behavior" taking on "Best I Ever Had." We're not entirely sure how anybody will be able to choose between these but hey, we've got to narrow it down to two songs eventually... right?</p>
