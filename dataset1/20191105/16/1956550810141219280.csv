The farm has more than 30 hectares of Christmas trees, 2,000 of which are now en route to Dubai.The trees travel to the UAE by sea in air-conditioned containers. They start the trip at The Port of Aarhus in the North Sea and are heading south towards Portugal, before they’ll cross the Mediterranean Sea, go down the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea, then make their way toward the Arabian Gulf to arrive at the Port of Jebel Ali.And anyone who buys one of the three lucky trees with trackers on will win instant vouchers worth Dhs2,000 to spend in Spinneys stores on everything from decorations to lights and festive food.The trees can be tracked online using an interactive map at spinneys-dubai.com to see their journey.Five sizes of Nordmann fir trees will be for sale this Christmas – starting at 100cm.
