      <h1>Christopher Jullien offers Lazio vs Celtic fan assurances as he looks forward to 'beautiful spectacle'</h1>
      <h2>The French defender doesn't anticipate trouble ahead of the Europe League match.</h2>

      <p>Celtic defender <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christopher-jullien">Christopher Jullien</a> doesn't think there will be trouble ahead of Thursday night's game with Lazio, insisting he's looking forward to "a beautiful spectacle".</p>
      <p>Neil Lennon's side can knock the Italians out of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> with a win, and tensions are high after the first game in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Members of the Irriducibili ultras group marched through Glasgow giving fascist salutes and singing 'Avanti Ragazzi di Buda', an anti-communist song popular with the Italian far-right.</p>
      <p>Celtic supporters unveiled banners reading "f*** off <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> " and a banner depicting a hanging Benito Mussolini with the words "follow your leader".</p>
      <p>There have been fears of reprisals in Rome this week, but Jullien isn't expecting any trouble.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/356090/lazio_celtic_esclusivo_jullien_rispettiamo_i_biancocelesti_immobile_e_un_top_player">Calciomercato.it</a> : "All of us only want to talk about football and about another great match.</p>
      <p>"That's what we at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> want and what everyone should want. We know that our fans follow the team in a positive manner and have a brilliant reputation when they travel in Europe.</p>
      <p>"They've been to Italy many times, visiting cities like Milan, Turin and Udine and they enjoyed some great games.</p>
      <p>"We want the same here, to support us on the pitch and to enjoy Rome, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p>
      <p>"We'll make the game a festival of sport, with two great teams ready to give life to a beautiful spectacle."</p>
      <p>Jullien scored the winner against Lazio in the first game and was asked for his opinion on Simone Inzaghi's side.</p>

      <p>"Obviously we respect them a lot. They scored a great goal in the first game and we know that they're a rich club with talented players.</p>
      <p>"It'll be another hard game.</p>
      <p>"Lazio create a lot of danger in search of the win, they're absolutely in contention to qualify and will want to put in a good performance for their fans.</p>
      <p>"We'll need to be ready, Lazio have already beaten Cluj easily at home and they've shown themselves to be a really difficult opponent.</p>

      <p>"We know we're facing a fierce rival with great qualities but we're also in good form right now so it'll be a great match.</p>
      <p>"Lazio have a great defence, with players like Bastos who is really fast, good physically and very talented.</p>
      <p>"They have quality and experience all over the pitch. (Sergej) Milinkovic-Savic is another brilliant element and (Ciro) Immobile is obviously a top player.</p>
      <p>"It'd be wrong to focus on names though, we're talking about a team that is very strong collectively."</p>
