      <p>A six-year-old boy is helping rough sleepers on the streets of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.</p>
      <p>Little Alfie Roncero goes out on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">streets</a> with his dad Richard to hand out hot drinks on a Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Ex-drug addict Richard, 36, found himself sleeping on the streets during his battle with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs">substance abuse</a>.</p>
      <p>When his little boy began asking him 'why people are always sitting on the ground' on Princes Street, he decided to teach Alfie about being kind.</p>
      <p>Richard said: "When handing out the coffees Alfie said that 'these people must be really cold'.</p>
      <p>"This was Alfie starting to see what being homeless truly means and the struggles they face.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to teach him that we need to be kind to people.</p>

      <p>"I think it's so important to show our kids that no matter where we end up in life, we should always show love, respect, and compassion to other people."</p>
      <p>One woman was so moved by Alfie's gesture in giving her a hot drink that she dubbed him 'a little angel'.</p>
      <p>Richard added: "Alfie was safe with his dad the entire time and I feel he learned so much that morning.</p>
      <p>"I want to instil morals and values into my son so he grows up not judging people, but willing to reach out and help where he can.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Alfie is a very clever little boy and has such a kind heart.</p>
      <p>"I'm really proud to call him my son."</p>
      <p>Four years ago, Richard took his daughter, Courtney, 16, out on Christmas Day to distribute warm clothing to rough sleepers.</p>
      <p>He said: "A lot of these people are suffering from addiction, which is an illness they don't have a solution for.</p>
      <p>"As a result they have been left homeless and don't have anybody.</p>
      <p>"Believe me when I say sleeping rough is hell. It's the loneliest place in the world.</p>
      <p>"Having someone give them their time, a couple of minutes' chat, something hot to drink and eat really does deliver hope to those who have given up.</p>
      <p>"Courtney and I went out onto the streets of Edinburgh on Christmas Day four years ago and handed out five pairs of gloves and five hats to those sleeping rough.</p>
      <p>"The experience was so humbling I decided the following year to make up ten little bags and do it again with my daughter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The year after that Courtney and I had got a group involved and we managed to make 40 massive Santa sacks filled with sleeping bags, jackets and jumpers."</p>
      <p>After being kicked out of school aged 15, Richard, who was born in Edinburgh, found that cocaine gave him the confidence he lacked.</p>
      <p>But it destroyed his relationships and saw him spend time in prison.</p>
      <p>After kicking his habit, he rebuilt his relationship with his daughter, bought a house and got a full-time job.</p>
      <p>He decided to form a charity, Steps to Hope, which now has 46 volunteers working at two separate soup kitchens which run on a Monday evening, and a Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Last week the team successfully fed 215 of the most vulnerable people living in Edinburgh. <br/>Most of the volunteers are former addicts.</p>
      <p>Richard said: "Using our own experience of homelessness and addiction to let our service users identify themselves with us.</p>
      <p>"We don't just feed our service users, but we fly a flag of recovery whilst doing it."</p>
