      <h1>German Court Slaps Down Harshest Sanctions Against Jobseekers</h1>

      <p>BERLIN (AFP) — Germany’s top court ruled Tuesday that sanctioning jobseekers deemed uncooperative in the search for work was illegal in some cases, in a blow to the controversial unemployment reforms rammed through by Gerhard Schroeder’s government in 2005.</p>
      <p>Judges at the federal constitutional court said that the total cut in benefits should never be allowed to exceed 30%, and in cases where lower payments would cause “extreme hardship,” no penalties need to be imposed at all.</p>
      <p>The sanctions allowed under Germany’s so-called Hartz IV benefits system, which combines social welfare and long-term unemployment payments, have long been controversial with critics saying they violate the right to a dignified existence.</p>
      <p>Under the current rules, a jobseeker’s monthly dole can be docked if they fail to turn up for a job interview, turn down employment or miss training opportunities.</p>
      <p>In extreme cases, recipients can lose up to 60% of their benefits — and repeat offenders can be cut off altogether for three months.</p>
      <p>But judges in Karlsruhe found that the 60% reduction was “unreasonable given that the burden it entails seriously encroaches upon the minimum standard of living guaranteed by fundamental rights.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, judges said that a 30% dole cut was “only permissible if the sanction can be waived in cases of extreme hardship” and if its three-month duration can be shortened depending on the jobseeker’s cooperation.</p>
      <p>A single jobseeker with no children currently receives $472 a month, while couples receive $845.</p>
      <p>The penalties for falling foul of the job center’s guidance are harshest for those under the age of 25.</p>
      <p>The Hartz IV system is part of the hated “Agenda 2010” labour reforms forced through by then chancellor Schroeder to tackle the country’s unemployment.</p>
      <p>The reforms have been credited with helping Germany achieve record-low unemployment of around five percent, but the tough-love approach has also been hugely divisive.</p>
      <p>Critics say Hartz IV has pushed people into low-paid, precarious jobs, and increased inequality in Germany.</p>
      <p>Opponents also say the threat of sanctions places a huge psychological burden on jobseekers.</p>
      <p>Schroeder paid a heavy political price for the hated measures, losing the following general election in 2005 to now chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
