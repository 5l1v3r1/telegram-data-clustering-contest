      <p><b>New York:</b> The U.S. dollar rose in late trading on Monday as upbeat U.S. non-farm payrolls report led to higher risk appetite.</p>
      <p>U.S. employers added 128,000 jobs in October, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. The reading topped the 75,000 forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch.</p>
      <p>Job gains mainly occurred in food services and drinking establishments, social assistance, and financial activities, the report showed. Within manufacturing, employment in motor vehicles and parts decreased, the bureau said, due to the six-week strike at General Motors.</p>
      <p>The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major peers, increased 0.32 percent at 97.5571 in late trading.</p>
      <p>In late New York trading, the euro fell to 1.1127 U.S. dollars from 1.1161 dollars in the previous session, and the British pound decreased to 1.2879 dollars from 1.2935 dollars in the previous session. The Australian dollar fell to 0.6880 dollar from 0.6907 dollar.</p>
      <p>The dollar bought 108.63 Japanese yen, higher than 108.25 Japanese yen of the previous session. The dollar increased to 0.9880 Swiss franc from 0.9856 Swiss franc, and it increased to 1.3150 Canadian dollars from 1.3146 Canadian dollars.</p>
