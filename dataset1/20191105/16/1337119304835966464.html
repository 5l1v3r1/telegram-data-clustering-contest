      <h1>Walmart drops lawsuit against Tesla over solar panel fires</h1>
      <h2>Walmart had said the fires were the result of ‘years of gross negligence’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:08:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-okane" target="_blank">Sean O'Kane</a></address>
      <p>Walmart has agreed to drop a lawsuit against Tesla over a rash of solar panel fires filed in August, according to a new filing with the New York State Supreme Court. The retail giant had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20825566/walmart-tesla-solar-panel-fire-lawsuit-negligence">claimed</a> that “years of gross negligence” by Tesla — and its solar panel subsidiary, SolarCity — led to fires on the roofs of at least seven of its stores, causing millions of dollars in damage, and resulting in Walmart having the solar panels deactivated.</p>
      <p>“Walmart and Tesla are pleased to have resolved the issues raised by Walmart concerning the Tesla solar installations at Walmart stores,” the companies said in a joint statement, without elaborating on the specifics of the agreement. “Safety is a top priority for each company and with the concerns being addressed, we both look forward to a safe re-energization of our sustainable energy systems.”</p>
      <aside>Walmart’s original complaint was explosive</aside>
      <p>Walmart’s lawyers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20825566/walmart-tesla-solar-panel-fire-lawsuit-negligence">had accused SolarCity</a> of adopting “an ill-considered business model that required it to install solar panel systems haphazardly and as quickly as possible in order to turn a profit” in the explosive complaint. They argued SolarCity relied on contractors and subcontractors who were “not been properly hired, trained, and supervised.”</p>
      <p>The lawyers also alleged in the lawsuit that Tesla did not properly handle Walmart’s complaints about the fires. Just days after the lawsuit was filed, <i>Business Insider</i> uncovered a secret program at Tesla dubbed “Project Titan” that was spun up to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-project-titan-replace-bad-solar-panel-parts-2019-8">quietly fix the defects that led to solar panel fires</a>.</p>
      <p>However, a settlement appears to have been in the works for a while. In August, Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove told <i>The Verge </i>that the companies were “working towards a resolution,” before adding that “if you were to characterize that as a settlement, we wouldn’t dispute it.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said in <a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1188161032843415554">a recent court deposition</a> that he spoke to Walmart’s CEO shortly after the lawsuit was filed, and the two “figured out a resolution.”</p>
      <p>“This lawsuit is going to be withdrawn,” Musk said.</p>
