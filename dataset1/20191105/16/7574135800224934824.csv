Agnes Obel

The following new tours were announced. Check the Tour Dates category every day for more.

AGNES OBEL

Danish artist Agnes Obel will release her fourth LP, Myopia, on February 21 via Blue Note and she’s just announced special pre-release shows happening in NYC (National Sawdust on January 16 & 17) and Los Angeles (Masonic Lodge on January 23 & 24). The rest of North America can catch her opening for Dead Can Dance in the spring. All dates are listed here.




ROC MARCIANO (with WESTSIDE GUNN & more)

The highly prolific, ’90s-style New York rapper Roc Marciano released three albums this year, and this year he kept it going with the recently released The Prequel. He has just two shows coming up before the year ends, one at DC’s Howard Theatre on 12/18 and one at NYC’s Sony Hall on 12/23 with likeminded artist Westside Gunn and a DJ set from the legendary Pete Rock.

H.E.R.

R&B/soul singer H.E.R. continues to rise and she has some shows coming up, including Las Vegas’ Intersect festival on 12/6, Sting’s Rainforest Fund benefit show at NYC’s Beacon Theatre on 12/9 (with Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, Shaggy, and more), and Hot 97’s Hot for the Holidays at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on 12/18 (with Khalid, Queen Naija, Wale, Kiana Lede, and more).

HEILUNG

Metal-friendly Nordic dark folk band Heilung recently announced their first-ever North American tour, and the anticipation for it is clearly high. They quickly sold out several shows, and they’ve been upgrading some to larger venues and adding more dates, including a second NYC show.

LUCERO

Twangy punks Lucero have announced a 2020 tour with Jade Jackson that has them out starting February 12 in Huntsville, AL and wrapping up with two shows in Atlanta on March 6 & 7. There’s a NYC-area stop at Jersey City’s White Eagle Hall on February 21. Head here for all dates.

EARTHGANG / MICK JENKINS

Atlanta rap duo EarthGang have been on the rise since releasing their very good new album Mirrorland (and becoming subject of a trending Twitter war), and after performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with The Roots last night (11/4), the duo added a slew of 2020 tour dates with Mick Jenkins.

BEST COAST

Best Coast will release new album, Always Tomorrow, in early 2020 and will be on tour starting in late February.

BAT FOR LASHES

Bat for Lashes released Lost Girls in September and she’s just announced a short North American tour, starting February 2 in Seattle and then hitting Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, DC, NYC and Toronto.

ANGELS & AIRWAVES

Tom DeLonge’s Angels & Airwaves will release a new album in 2020 and tour as well.

WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY

Ahead of the January release of their new album  All Borders Are Porous to Cats, World/Inferno Friendship Society have some upcoming dates on both coasts and will play New Year’s Eve in NYC.

STELLY DONNELLY

Australia-based singer-songwriter Stella Donnelly released new album Beware of the Dogs earlier this year and will be heading over to the U.S. for shows in January.

PART TIME / GARY WILSON

Two eccentric pop tastes that taste great together, Part Time and Gary Wilson toured together this year and it went so well they’re doing it again in 2020. This time it’s on the West Coast with a few Southwest shows as well, including stops in El Paso, Phoenix, San Diego, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Sacramento San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Spokane, Boise, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. Most dates are with Bryson Cone. Head here for details.
