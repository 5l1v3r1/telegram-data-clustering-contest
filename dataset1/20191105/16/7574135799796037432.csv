My Chemical Romance add reunion shows w/ Jimmy Eat World, including Download Fest
05 Nov 2019, 16:51 by Andrew Sacher



My Chemical Romance recently revealed they’d be reuniting this year, and they announced one show happening in LA on December 20, which sold out immediately. We figured more dates would be announced soon, and today that turned out to be true. MCR have expanded their reunion to include a headlining slot at Australia’s Download Festival in March (alongside Deftones, Jimmy Eat World, and many others), and right after that they’re playing a headlining New Zealand show on 3/25 with Jimmy Eat World, Midnight Youth, and Miss June. Presumably even more shows (including more US dates) will be announced soon. Stay tuned!
Update: They’re also playing Japan’s Download Festival with Jimmy Eat World, The Offspring, At The Gates, and more.
As for Jimmy Eat World, they have a bunch of tour dates coming up in support of this year’s Surviving, including NY/NJ shows this month and the ALT 92.3 holiday show at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center with Vampire Weekend in December.
