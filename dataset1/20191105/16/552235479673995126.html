      <h2>Anthony Hollern made off with hundreds of pounds of his relative's belongings.</h2>

      <p>A heartless thief broke into his disabled cousin’s home and made off with hundreds of pounds worth of his belongings in an act described as “despicable”.</p>
      <p>Anthony Hollern smashed his way into the man’s house with a spade in Dumbarton East in broad daylight, alerting a neighbour who watched it all unfold.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old, who was also accompanied by a woman, lifted a TV, cables, remote controls, a football shirt, electric razor and tobacco.</p>
      <p>He appeared in the dock at Dumbarton Sheriff Court last week where he was locked up for two years.</p>
      <p>His lawyer said Hollern, formerly of Brucehill, had knocked back 30 Valium tablets before his crime, which he committed with “no finesse or subtlety whatsoever”.</p>
      <p>Explaining the relationship between Hollern and his victim, Kevin Doherty, fiscal depute, said: “The complainer is a relative of the accused.</p>
      <p>“He is a vulnerable individual who is disabled and requires intensive support from his family. Anthony Hollern is well aware of that.”</p>
      <p>He said a neighbour phoned the police immediately on seeing Hollern break into the house on Victoria Street.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The fiscal continued: “He was accompanied by a woman. He smashed a window to the property and thereafter entered and removed various items of property.</p>
      <p>“Police attended to a report of housebreaking. Hollern and the woman were found nearby.</p>
      <p>“He had a bag containing property from the flat. He had items of property stolen from the flat in his pocket.</p>
      <p>“The items stolen were a TV and cables, remote controls, a football shirt, electic razor and a quantity of tobacco.</p>
      <p>“The value of the items stolen were £400.”</p>
      <p>All of the stolen goods were recovered and Hollern, who has three previous convictions for housebreaking, later pled guilty to the break-in and theft.</p>
      <p>Kenny Clark, defending, described it as an “opportunistic” offence, claiming Hollern had gone over to his cousin’s to have a drink with him.</p>
      <p>He said: “Mr Hollern in the past has had a drug problem. He has managed to control that drug problem but in the period leading up to this offence, he had been abusing Valium.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“On the evening and overnight, he reckons he consumed 30 Valium tablets.</p>
      <p>“It’s his belief that he went to his cousin’s house with, who he was on good terms with, to have a drink.</p>
      <p>“His cousin was not in and that’s when he managed to obtain a spade from an insecure cellar nearby.</p>
      <p>“He took the spade and broke the window. There was no finesse or subtlety whatsoever.</p>
      <p>“It would appear to support his explanation that it was opportunistic. He describes it to me as complete stupidity.</p>
      <p>“He recognises the gravity of it. He has three previous convictions for theft by housebreaking, one at a solemn level.”</p>
      <p>Describing the offence as “despicable”, Sheriff William Gallacher said: “You knew this was a person who required assistance and support and you violated that and destroyed the trust and confidence and you did that to satisfy yourself.”</p>
      <p>Hollern, whose address was given in court papers as Greenock prison, was sentenced to two years in jail, backdated to August 30.</p>
