        <i>“In my opinion, the performance in qualifying was very positive, so it seems that we have really taken a step in that area compared to the rest of the midfield. In addition, the start of both of our cars was great again. </i>

        <i>“What we have to work on now is the next step in the race itself, not just the qualification. Ricciardo was slightly faster on Sunday. We have now seen twice that we have a problem with the aero that suddenly comes around. First in Mexico, now here. Maybe we should convert some of Saturday's performance to race space.”</i>

      <p>McLaren have had a solid season and will hope to keep improving as they head into the 2020 season and look to the future. </p>
