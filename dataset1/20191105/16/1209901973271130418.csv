It’s November, time for some interesting events before the busy Christmas season!
The Stettler Public Library is pleased to have Alana Skocdopole of Model Milk in Calgary come and help you Wine Down a Little.
This is a Wine Survivor boot camp to prepare you for the Christmas Wine Survivor event in December. Join us on Saturday, Nov. 16th at 7 p.m. as Alana leads us on a sensory tour of a variety of wines.
Learn more about the notes and flavours of different wines and what pairs well with each.
Register at the Library for the low cost of $12 for an informative and fun night. Bring your friends and make it a date! Call us at 403-742-2292 for more information.
Don’t forget to get your tickets for the 2nd annual Friends of the Library Christmas Wine Survivor!
For just $20 and a $15 bottle of wine, you can win enough wine to get you through the holiday season.
Tickets are on sale until Dec. 5th.
Our wonderful Friends of the Library Group will be hosting an Elimination Party on Saturday, Dec. 7th for all the members of the Stettler Public Library who have bought a ticket.
You do not have to attend the elimination party to win, but you will have fun if you do. Not a member yet?
We have a remedy for that! Memberships are free to residents of Stettler and Stettler County thanks to the support of our Town and County Council!
For more information, call the Library at 403-742-2292. The proceeds from this fundraiser will go towards the establishment of an equipment lending collection at the Library.
The English Conversation Café happening on Mondays at 10 a.m. and Wednesdays at 6 p.m. is an excellent way to practice your English conversation in a small, friendly group setting, facilitated by the Stettler Learning Centre. Join our Café community as often as you like and enjoy complimentary treats.

She has a wealth of knowledge about community and government resources and can provide expert help with anything job related such as resumes, cover letters, work search, and interview skills.
