      <p>With the first blast of snowfall recently, Stettler County Public Works is gearing up for its snow removal season, advising residents that it could take upwards of a week for crews to clear away large amounts of snowfall from primary road networks.</p>
      <p>County of Stettler Director of Operations Rick Green says that crews would first concentrate on the main road network, followed by laneway and road shoulder clearing.</p>
      <p>“Activities, such as school or work, may need to be adjusted on major events, or planning alternate vehicles with higher clearance for necessary trips, should take place,” he said.</p>
      <p>Green explains that 15 cm of snowfall is the guideline the County follows to identify needs and their response to service requests.</p>
      <p>The County of Stettler prioritizes its snow plowing, itemized in its Snow Plowing Service Standards policy, by first plowing its hard-surfaced roads, such as in hamlets and subdivisions, followed by the access roads to subdivisions.</p>
      <p>Crews would then work on plowing gravel roads, and later start laneway plowing.</p>
      <p>Green says that approximately 60 of the County’s residents have signed up to receive the laneway snow plowing service, available for farms and acreages.</p>
      <p>“Laneways are our last priority with no one laneway taking priority over others,” Green said.</p>
      <p>“Work completed is focused on the fastest way to accomplish the clearing without backtracking,” he added.</p>
      <p>The County of Stettler doesn’t specifically budget for snow removal, stating that, “It is handled through a number of budget areas,” such as the cost of fuel, wages, and capital equipment costs.</p>
      <p>County of Stettler Director of Communications Niki Thorsteinsson says the County has put enough money aside in its budget to, “Keep all our graders and plow trucks moving full-time for the entire season.</p>
      <p>“In the event that we have a light snow year and we don’t have the big snow events or episodes, we end up with a little surplus in our budget,” she said.</p>
