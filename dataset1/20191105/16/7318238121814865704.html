      <h1>Turkey says it has captured the sister of dead ISIS leader</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:02:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:02</time> by <a rel="author">F. Brinley Bruton and Aziz Akyavas and ReutersÂ </a></address>
      <p>Turkey has captured the sister of<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-leader-isis-targeted-u-s-raid-n1072506">dead Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, a senior Turkish official said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The detention Monday in northern Syria was "another example of the success of Turkey's counter-terrorism operation," President Tayyip Erdogan's communications director Fahrettin Altun said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Our determination to bring justice to those who seek to terrorize our people and destabilize our region cannot be questioned," he added.</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/how-u-s-commandos-took-out-isis-terror-chief-abu-n1072546">was killed on Oct. 26 in a U.S.-led raid in northwestern Syria</a>, President Donald Trump announced Sunday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Reuters reported that Rasmiya Awad, 65, had been captured in a raid near Azaz, Syria. Azaz is in a Turkish-controlled town near the border.</p>
      <p>She was accompanied by five children when captured, Reuters reported, sourcing an unnamed official</p>
      <p>"We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi's sister on the inner workings of ISIS," the official told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Little independent information is available on Baghdadi's sister and NBC News was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her.</p>
      <p>Altun, meanwhile, said the woman's capture was evidence of Turkey's determination to fight against ISIS.</p>
      <p>"Much dark propaganda against Turkey has been circulating to raise doubts about our resolve against Daesh," Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter, using another name for ISIS.</p>
