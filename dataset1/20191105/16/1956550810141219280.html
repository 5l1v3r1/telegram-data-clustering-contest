      <p>It’s never too early to start thinking about your <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas/383556-where-to-buy-a-christmas-tree-in-dubai-2018">Christmas tree</a> (well maybe for some people, but we’re in a festive mood over here) and now supermarket Spinneys has launched a new campaign where you can see your tree’s journey to the UAE.<br/><br/>More than 2,000 Nordmann fir trees have been ordered by Spinneys to arrive from Denmark this Christmas, and they’re due to arrive on Thursday November 21.<br/><br/>And three of them are fitted with GPS trackers, so you can follow the trees’ journey from Denmark to the UAE.<br/><br/>The trees started out Trine Grice’s farm – a third generation Christmas tree farmer in Denmark. The farm has more than 30 hectares of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/christmas">Christmas</a> trees, 2,000 of which are now en route to Dubai.<br/><br/>The trees travel to the UAE by sea in air-conditioned containers. They start the trip at The Port of Aarhus in the North Sea and are heading south towards Portugal, before they’ll cross the Mediterranean Sea, go down the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea, then make their way toward the Arabian Gulf to arrive at the Port of Jebel Ali.<br/><br/>And anyone who buys one of the three lucky trees with trackers on will win instant vouchers worth Dhs2,000 to spend in Spinneys stores on everything from decorations to lights and festive food.<br/><br/>The trees can be tracked online using an interactive map at spinneys-dubai.com to see their journey.<br/><br/>Five sizes of Nordmann fir trees will be for sale this Christmas – starting at 100cm. Prices start at Dhs195.<br/><br/>We're buying decorations already.<br/><br/>Feeling festive?
