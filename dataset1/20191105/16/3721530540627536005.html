      <p>Overwatch’s lore has been largely stagnant in the past few years. Since Blizzard released <i>Overwatch</i> in 2016, Winston’s been trying to get the gang back together — but most of the story’s been set in the past, a way to establish the game’s characters and build out its world.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 1, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20940362/overwatch-2-release-date-blizzcon-2019">Blizzard announced <i>Overwatch 2</i></a>, a new Overwatch experience the developer promised will put story into the game. (Most of <i>Overwatch</i>’s lore is in comic books, animated videos, and — weirdly enough — a cookbook.) <i>Overwatch 2</i> will add story missions, wherein the world’s heroes are reunited to take on the present-day bad guys that threaten humanity. Clearly, time’s passed between <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>Overwatch</i> 2, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2019/11/1/20944181/overwatch-2-gameplay-changes-blizzcon-2019">something explicit in the visual changes to the game’s heroes</a>. Genji now wears clothes. Reinhardt’s embracing his grey hair. Lúcio’s hair now glows, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=lucio%20hair%20&amp;src=typd">apparently changing along with his abilities</a>. And Mercy? Well, she got a haircut.</p>

      <p><i>Overwatch</i> fans <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/mercy-looks-like-an-angry-soccer-mom/422898">online immediately noticed</a> Mercy’s new ’do, a short cut that’s not unlike “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/collections/10-memes-of-karen-the-infamous-speak-to-the-manager-haircut">The Karen</a>.” Look, it’s clear Mercy wants to speak with your manager.</p>

      <p>Mercy used to sport a ponytail that now appears to be chopped off. Blizzard didn’t show a back view of Mercy’s hair, but there’s a short piece in the back — seen from the front — that gives the appearance of The Karen. <a href="https://ynartistic.tumblr.com/post/188803255222/quick-doodle-of-mercys-new-look-in-overwatch-2-i">But maybe it’s actually a bob</a>! Perhaps there’s a short ponytail back there. Don’t worry, though. I’ve reached out to Blizzard for more clarification about this important issue.</p>
      <p>The confusing part is that in the <i>Overwatch 2</i> cinematic, Mercy’s wearing her old uniform and clearly has a ponytail. Somewhere between there and the gameplay trailer she debuted the new cut, clearly a symbol of her growth. Or something!</p>

      <p>Regardless, most of the Overwatch fandom doesn’t seem to care whether Mercy’s new haircut is a Karen or not. They like it just the same.</p>
