      <p>(Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service will use Nvidia Corp’s artificial intelligence technology to improve efficiency of package data processing, the chip designer said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The new AI system will help process package data 10 times faster for the Postal Service, which processes and delivers about 146 billion pieces of mail in a year, Nvidia said.</p>
      <p>Nvidia’s systems are being purchased by the Postal Service under a contract with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.</p>
      <p>The tie-up is expected to be fully operational by spring of 2020, Nvidia said, adding that delivery and testing of the system will start this year.</p>
