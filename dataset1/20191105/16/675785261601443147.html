      <h2>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp's words before his side stunned Barcelona have been revealed by attacker Sadio Mane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:13:49+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool enjoyed one of the finest moments in their history when they stunned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> en route to Champions League glory last season.</p>
      <p>Few gave the Reds a prayer as they entered the second leg at Anfield 3-0 down and staring at a semi-final exit.</p>
      <p>Yet they performed a miraculous comeback to shock the Catalan giants, snatching a 4-3 aggregate win before lifting their sixth European crown against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Striker Sadio Mane has now revealed exactly what Jurgen Klopp told his side immediately before they stepped out onto the Anfield pitch on a historic night.</p>
      <p>And he claims Klopp predicted his side would perform the unthinkable to secure their spot in the final.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/">France Football</a> , Mane recalled: "He always knows what to say and even then, he finds a way to surprise you.</p>
      <p>"Like last season before the second leg against FC Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals. He said: 'Hey guys, I've got some good news for you.'</p>
      <p>"'The good news is that Barcelona is a team that likes to play and we love playing against those (types of) teams. You'll see. We're going to reach the final.'</p>
      <p>"It really was the best way to take the pressure off us."</p>

      <p>In the same interview, Mane explained the "secret' behind Klopp's successful command of the Anfield dressing room - being a father figure to his players.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese striker said: “His secret, I think, is to be the team’s dad. Between us, everything clicked straight away.</p>
      <p>"We all love him like a father and we fear him like one too.</p>
      <p>"He takes up a lot of space in my life, and not just in football. He’s great as a person.</p>
      <p>"I trust him blindly, like most of the dressing room, I think.”</p>
