      <p>Some pieces will also be shown in exhibitions across the UK, including the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and York Art Gallery, and in Japan, Australia and the US as part of an international touring programme. </p>
      <p>National Portrait Gallery director Nicholas Cullinan said: “This is a unique and important chapter in our history as we embark on our journey to deliver a transformed National Portrait Gallery, which will enable us to become more welcoming and engaging to all and fulfil our role as the nation’s family album.”</p>
      <p>“We are delighted to be able to partner with organisations across the UK and internationally to share our collection to new and existing audiences. </p>
      <p>“We look forward to hearing from other organisations who are interested in working with us during this time, so that we can make the most of this extraordinary opportunity to circulate a national collection as widely as possible in both innovative and collaborative ways.”</p>
