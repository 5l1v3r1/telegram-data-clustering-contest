Aimbot video leads to lifetime ban for popular Fortnite pro
Khattri offers tearful apology, says he never cheated in ""competitive scenario.""

Jarvis Khattri has built a significant part of his 17-year-old life around Fortnite. The UK-based player has attracted over 2 million followers on YouTube in just a couple of years, and he signed with the esports monolith FaZe Clan for competitive play in April.
Now all that is at risk of falling apart. That's because Epic Games has issued Khattri a lifetime ban from Fortnite after he posted a video (since deleted, mirrored here) showing him using aimbot software to cheat in the game.
In an emotional apology video posted Sunday, Khattri admits to posting ""some videos of me using aimbots in solo and playground mode."" But he says in the apology that this is the ""first time I've ever done anything like this"" and that he's ""never done anything like this in a competitive scenario.""
In the video that led to the ban, Khattri says he's not playing on his main account and that he will play ""a game or two without aimbot"" to avoid ban detection. Khattri also mentions ""playing on a new PC"" because ""I don't want to get my main PC banned,"" suggesting he was somewhat aware of the risks of using an aimbot on video.

In his apology, though, Khattri said that he ""just thought about entertaining you guys"" when making the aimbot video and never expected this level of consequence. ""Being banned forever... a lifetime ban is just... I didn't expect this would happen,"" he says while holding back tears. ""Especially from a game I would love so much."" Khattri also said that using the aimbot was a ""huge mistake and completely wrong on my end... Cheating is never acceptable. I should have paid more attention to the community rules and ToS.""
The Fortnite EULA explicitly prohibits ""running or using methods which are not authorized by Epic and which interfere with the outcome and/or the course of the Software (including Cheats, bots, scripts, or mods not expressly authorized by Epic).""
""We have a zero tolerance policy for the usage of cheat software,"" Fortnite maker Epic said in a statement provided to press. ""When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly.""
While some are applauding Epic's decision, others see some hypocrisy in Khattri's treatment when compared to other Fortnite cheaters. Back in May, duo partner XXiF and Ronaldo received a ban of just 14 days after they were caught colluding for easy kills during professional qualifiers. The pair later qualified for August's World Cup Finals, where they were received poorly by the crowd.
