New turn in Mayo GAA saga

05 Nov 2019, 16:23

THE ongoing Mayo GAA dispute took another turn today (Tuesday) when Charlestown Sarsfields GAA issued a statement in response to last night's county board meeting.
They say a motion of confidence was not voted on at the meeting, and the club also hit out at the exclusion of the press from the meeting.
The full statement from the club – published on its website and social media platforms - reads:
“Following a county board meeting held last night, the 4th of November 2019 in McHale Park, a statement released by the PRO stated that a motion of confidence in the Executive had been passed with the 'overwhelming support' of the delegates.
“We have been contacted by a number of club members in relation to this issue. It is our understanding that a motion was proposed by an honorary county board officer who is not a club delegate and seconded by a delegate, but that no vote was held on this very important motion.
“Our club delegate did not vote on this proposal nor was he given the opportunity and we would ask the County Board Executive to clarify last night's statement.
“We also cannot condone the exclusion of the media from last night's meeting and the proposal to ban then from all future meetings.”
