      <p>The <b>Central Bank of Nigeria</b> (CBN), according to its latest payment statistics, disclosed that the Federal Government paid $1.09 billion to service external debt between January and September 2019.</p>
      <p><b>According to the </b><a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/IntOps/Payments.asp?PayDate=11/6/2019%2010:16:03%20AM"><b>Central Bank’s statistics</b></a>, Nigeria paid highest in August with $199.8 million; lowest in June with $18.58 million, and paid an average of $121.41 million over the course of the 9 months.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members of the CBN have continued to express concerns over increasing debt and its vulnerability to the nation’s economic growth.</p>
      <p>“<i>As the threat of debt vulnerability continues, a coordinated domestic revenue expansion with simultaneous fiscal prudence as suggested in the last MPC meeting still remains the key to addressing the weak fiscal position of the economy,</i>” Dr Robert Asogwa, member of the MPC.</p>
      <p><b>The Minister of Finance</b>, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had said that Nigeria’s debt profile was not as frightening as people claimed. The minister insisted that the country was not going to have a debt crisis in spite of the increased level of foreign and domestic debt stock.</p>
