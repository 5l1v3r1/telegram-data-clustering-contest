      <h2>They have established a memorial tree for people leave messages on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:37:12+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Geddes, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jonathan-geddes/</a></address>
      <p>Colleagues at Co-op Funeralcare in Rutherglen are encouraging locals to pay homage to those in the Armed Forces with a memorial tree, ahead of Remembrance Day on November 10.</p>
      <p>The funeral home has created a memorial tree to encourage people to write messages to loved ones who may have served, or who are serving, in the Armed Forces and place it on the tree.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Rutherglen</a> funeral home has also decorated its window in a poppy-inspired red theme, paying tribute to the Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>Visitors will be invited to make a donation to Poppy Scotland too, best known for its iconic Poppy Scotland Appeal, which raises on average £2 million a year.</p>
      <p>The poppy is a powerful symbol, worn to commemorate the sacrifices of the Armed Forces and to show support to those still serving today and their loved ones.</p>

      <p>The Poppy Scotland Appeal goes directly to provide through-life care to anyone currently serving in the Armed Forces or who has previously served, and their families.</p>
      <p>Hugh Wright, Funeral Director at Co-op Funeralcare in Rutherglen, said: “We know how close Remembrance Day is to the hearts of many of within the community, which is why we were keen to provide a dedicated space for people to remember their loved ones who served.</p>

However, we understand talking about this may be difficult so we want to invite all to pop in and write a memory for the tree or simply show your respect by donating £1 to the Poppy Appeal”.</p>
