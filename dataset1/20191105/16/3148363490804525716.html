      <h1>U.S. Services Sector Growth Accelerated in October | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Growth in the U.S. services sector picked up in October, suggesting that the U.S. economy remains on a strong footing despite sluggishness in manufacturing and a global economic slowdown.</h2>

      <p>The Institute for Supply Management <a href="https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/NonMfgROB.cfm?SSO=1">said</a> Tuesday that its non-manufacturing index rose to 54.7 percent in October, up from 52.6 percent in September. That beat economists estimate and even topped the range of estimates, according to Econoday.</p>
      <p>Any reading above 50 signals growth.</p>
      <p>The new orders component rose 1.9 percentage points to 55.6 percent. This was bolstered entirely by domestic demand as exports were flat. That is a sign of ongoing strength of the U.S. consumer.</p>
      <p>Thirteen of the 18 industries that make up the ISM’s measure of the services sector expanded in October, including the politically sensitive agricultural sector and ecnomically-potent construction. Transportation expanded. The tells for consumer discretionary spending–arts and entertainment, hospitality and food services–were also up.</p>
      <p>Mining contracted, continuing its bumpy ride this year as low oil prices have discouraged new production.</p>
