      <h1>What’s new in Chrome OS: Virtual Desks, simpler printing and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Kuscher</a></address>
      <p>One of the best parts of Chromebooks is that every new version of Chrome OS brings dozens of improvements to keep your device safe, fast and hassle-free. The latest version of Chrome OS includes tools to help you organize your workspace, make phone calls more easily, and print and share feedback more quickly.</p>
      <h3>Organize your workspace with Virtual Desks</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the number of windows and tabs you have open? Organize your workspace and multitask more easily with Virtual Desks on Chromebook. </p>
      <p>Think of Virtual Desks as separate workspaces within your Chromebook. Use this feature to create helpful boundaries between projects or activities. If you’re working on multiple projects, you can dedicate a desk to each one. Or if you like to take a break during the workday, you could create a desk for web browsing or gaming. If you’re a student, you can create a different desk for each class. </p>
      <p>Once the latest Chrome OS update arrives on your device, open Overview and tap New Desk in the top right-hand corner of your screen to try out Virtual Desks. Try dragging windows between desks. </p>

      <p>You can also try out the following keyboard shortcuts to take full advantage of Virtual Desks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new Desk with “Shift” + “Search ” + “=”</li>
        <li>Switch between Desks with “Search ” + “]” </li>
        <li>Move windows between Desks with “Shift” + “Search ” + “]”</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Click-to-call</h3>
      <p>Chromebooks just got even better for people who use an Android phone. Now, you can right-click a phone number when browsing the web on your Chromebook and send the number to your mobile phone. </p>
      <p>To set-up this feature, sign into your Google account on your Chromebook and phone and ensure that you’ve <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;oco=1">turned on syncing</a> for Chrome browser. Save time by getting on the phone quicker and work across devices more easily. </p>
      <h3>Print without hassle</h3>
      <p>Now, compatible printers will automatically show up in your printer list—no setup needed. Press Ctrl + P on your keyboard, choose your printer, and you’re done. </p>
      <p>We've also reduced the number of steps needed to save printers to your profile.  If there’s a specific printer you use frequently, you can now save it as default. Just visit your Settings and head to the Printers section.</p>

      <h3>Share feedback more easily</h3>
      <p>When members of the Chromebook community share thoughts on how to improve our software, our team reviews the suggestions to determine what we’ll build next. For example, a few months ago we implemented improvements to <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/whats-new-august2019/">notification management</a> based on comments from Chromebook owners. </p>
      <p>Now it’s even easier for you to quickly share feedback. Just press and hold your power button for a second, and alongside the “Lock” and “Power off” buttons, you will now see a dedicated button for feedback. </p>
