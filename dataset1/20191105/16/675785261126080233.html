      <p>The grieving family of nine people gunned down by cartel gunman have spoken about the horror that claimed the lives of their loved ones.</p>
      <p>Three American mothers and six gunmen from a Mormon community were ambushed by gang members.</p>
      <p>The victims, who belonged to the LeBaron family, were attacked roughly eight miles apart in the Mexican border state of Sonora on Monday while traveling in a convoy of three SUVs.</p>
      <p>Nine of the LeBaron family members, who have ties to Utah, were slaughtered in the massacre and one child was still missing.</p>

      <p>On social media one family member said that gunmen opened fire on one child running away while others burned to death inside a car that was torched.</p>
      <p>Six children were wounded in the attack and five have since been transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
      <p>Other young children managed to escape and hide by the roadside while one of the mothers was shot in the chest as she put her hands up to surrender.</p>
      <p>Relatives fear some of the victims may have been raped.</p>

      <p>The exact motive of the brutal killings on a dirt road between the Chihuahua and Sonora states is not clear.</p>
      <p>Some family members believe it was an attempted kidnapping.</p>

      <p>The relatives say her car had broken down when gunmen opened fire. They set her car ablaze which caused the petrol tank to explode.</p>

      <p>A male voice can be heard in the clip sayng: "This is for the record. Nita and four of my grandchildren are burnt and shot up."</p>
      <p>Eight miles away in different attacks, several other family members were gunned down.</p>

      <p>The State's attorney general's office confirmed officials from Chihuahua had been sent to the area to assist.</p>
      <p>Sonora Governor Claudia Pavlovich Arellano said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> her office was collaborating with the investigation.</p>
      <p>"As a mother, I feel angry, scorn and a profound pain for the cowardly events in the mountains between Sonora and Chihuahua," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what type of monsters would dare to hurt women and children.</p>
      <p>As governor, you have all my collaboration so that this doesn't remain unpunished and the responsible parties pay.”</p>
