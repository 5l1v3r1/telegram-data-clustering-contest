      <h1>Houston Astros owner vows to 'take a run' at Gerrit Cole during free agency</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:32:14+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/houston-astros">Houston Astros</a> owner Jim Crane didn’t appear that he was willing to let Gerrit Cole leave the team without a fight, assuring the media Monday the team will “take a run” at the pitcher during free agency.</p>
      <p>Cole, whose last impression with the club may have been him addressing reporters while wearing a Boras Corp. hat in the locker room following the team’s Game 7 loss to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> in the World Series, is expected to command a salary well north of $200 million.</p>

      <p>“We're going to take a run at it. We don't know if we can get to where they want to get,” Crane told reporters, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/brianmctaggart/status/1191419993818316801">Houston Chronicle</a>.</p>
      <p>He added that he is aware super-agent Scott Boras is “tough to deal with.”</p>

      <p>Cole was among the top pitchers in the American League last season. But he appeared to be clearly frustrated with the team failing to use him in a pivotal moment in Game 7.</p>
      <p>He finished the 2019 season with a 20-5 record, a 2.50 ERA and 326 strikeouts.</p>

      <p>Cole has been rumored to be interested in returning to his native California, which makes it likely the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/los-angeles-angels">Los Angeles Angels</a> would be top suitors.</p>
