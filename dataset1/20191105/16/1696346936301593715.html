      <h1>Trial of Former OneCoin Lawyer Kicks Off In New York</h1>

        <b>The trial of an American lawyer accused of laundering money for the notorious OneCoin pyramid scheme, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/05/cryptocurrency_scam_onecoin/">began in New York</a> yesterday. The lawyer is the first of three key players in the scam to face trial. However the founder, self-styled Crypto-Queen, Ruja </b>
        <b>Ignatova, is still on the run.</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Defendant Denies Any Wrongdoing</h3>
      <p>The lawyer, Mark Scott, formerly a partner at Locke Lord LLP, denies moving hundreds of millions of dollars from the OneCoin scheme into offshore accounts. He was arrested just over a year ago, for his role in the multi-billion dollar global pyramid scheme.</p>
      <p>Formal charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud were brought <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/onecoin-update-former-locke-lord-attorney-faces-laundering-charges/">last month</a>, when Scott plead ‘not guilty’.</p>
      <p>His defence is likely to hinge on his claim that, although he did move millions of dollars through the scheme, he was unaware that it was a criminal scheme. He even claims to have raised several concerns about OneCoin, although to whom wasn’t specified.</p>
      <p>The hearings are expected to last two to three weeks.</p>
      <h3>Ongoing OneCoin Court Action</h3>
      <p>Also facing prosecution are OneCoin co-founder, Sebastian Greenwood, who was arrested in Thailand last year and extradited to the US, and Konstantin Ignatov. Ignatov is the brother of OneCoin founder, Ruja Ignatova, and was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/onecoin-ponzi-scam-ringleaders-charged-in-united-states/">arrested at LAX airport</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Ruja Ignatova is still at large, but has been charged in her absence with various counts of fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>OneCoin is also being taken to court in a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/onecoin-us-lawsuit-ponzi-scheme/">class-action lawsuit</a>, brought by an investor who lost $103k to the scheme.</p>
      <p>Despite all of this, OneCoin continues to function in certain jurisdictions around the globe. It was recently the subject of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84">BBC Sounds documentary</a>, speculating as to the whereabouts of the Crypto-Queen.</p>
      <p>Possibly living incognito in Europe, having had extensive facial reconstructive surgery using all the OneCoin money… in case you were interested.</p>
