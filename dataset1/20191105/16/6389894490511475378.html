      <p>Audit watchdog the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) today warned that the top firms were failing to be robust enough in challenging management of the companies they audit.</p>
      <p>The audit sector is in the political and regulatory spotlight following company failures such as the collapse of travel agent Thomas Cook and outsourcer Carillion.</p>
      <p>The FRC today said “audit quality is still not consistently reaching the necessary high standards expected”.</p>

      <p>It flagged challenging management and performing routine procedures such as revenue recognition as particular concerns.</p>
      <p>The FRC’s executive director of supervision David Rule said: “At a time when the whole audit market faces reform, we expect audit firms to make audit quality their number-one priority and to have effective programmes of work to deliver consistently high standards.”</p>
      <p>Other shortcomings identified include year-on-year familiarity with audited companies leading to the same approach being followed even when changes in the business or trading environment demand a different strategy.</p>
      <p>The FRC said audit teams too often accept unrealistic deadlines, resulting in inadequate work.</p>

      <p>It also said audit teams too often accept what they are told by management, rather than questioning its plausibility and drawing on specialists to form their own view.</p>
      <p>Rule said: “Inconsistent quality erodes confidence in the profession, which can lead to diminished trust in business. Stakeholders and investors rightly demand high-quality work on all audits.</p>
      <p>“While we see many examples of high-quality audit, our inspectors are still identifying too many audits which require significant improvements. Inspections show that challenge of management is a particular area of concern on which audit firms need to focus.”</p>
      <p>The watchdog said it would start to publish summaries and grades from its annual inspections of sample audits of listed firms.</p>
      <p>The pilot would apply to audits from March 2020 and name the audit firm and customer being audited – but only if both parties give their consent.</p>
      <p>The FRC’s latest inspection round found all of the top seven firms – the Big Four plus Mazars, BDO and Grant Thornton – had failed to reach the target that at least 90 per cent of audits inspected should be “good” or requiring only limited improvements.</p>
