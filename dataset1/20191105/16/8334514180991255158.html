      <p>After a wave of Air France strikes that cost 335 million euros ($373 million) in 2018, the Franco-Dutch airline group has stabilized under Chief Executive Ben Smith thanks to union deals that have increased both wage costs and operating flexibility.</p>
      <p>In his first major strategy presentation since he joined from Air Canada last year, Smith set a 7-8% profit margin goal for 2024 and dangled the “prospect” of renewed dividends - last paid out to shareholders in 2008.</p>
      <p>These would resume if operating income rises to 1.9 billion euros from the 1.3 billion euros reported in 2018, the group said.</p>
      <p>Shares in the company, which had gained 11.5% so far this year, were down 6.5% at 9.88 euros as of 1458 GMT, with one trader citing expectations that a dividend may not materialize before 2022 as one chief disappointment.</p>
      <p>Air France-KLM “has all the assets to regain its leadership position,” Smith said in a statement before the presentation.</p>
      <p>To boost sales, the group aims to sharpen the focus of its three main airline brands. Air France will push harder into premium travel, leaving KLM positioned as a competitive network operator of connecting flights through Amsterdam while Transavia expands into the low-cost market.</p>
      <p>Transavia will add two more aircraft based in Nantes, western France, and open a new base in the Mediterranean city of Montpellier next spring, Smith said. Air France struck a recent union deal to allow Transavia’s fleet expansion, but pilot recruitment delays have continued to hold back growth this year.</p>
      <p>Air France KLM’s operating margin came in at 4.8% for the first nine months of 2019, a 1.7 point decline from the same period a year earlier..</p>
      <p>The group also pledged to drive costs lower by speeding up the renewal of its planes and streamlining the management of its combined fleet of more than 500 aircraft.</p>

      <p>Air France-KLM took a 100 million euro charge last quarter to retire its Airbus A380 superjumbos early and replace them with more fuel-efficient planes.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good time to buy long-haul airplanes,” Smith said, citing the weaker aviation market outlook.</p>
      <p>Smith overcame Dutch objections earlier this year to integrate Air France and KLM fleet management, which was still being carried out separately 15 years after the airlines merged.</p>
