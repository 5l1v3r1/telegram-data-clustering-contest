      <p>MOSCOW (AFP) — Russian customs officers have detained a woman at the Chinese border with over 4 pounds of gold in her shoes after she appeared to be walking strangely, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Russian was detained at a customs post in eastern Siberia after officials noticed that she “was nervous and acted in a suspicious manner,” said Marina Boiko, a spokeswoman for the regional customs authorities.</p>
      <p>“The young woman unnaturally placed one foot in front of the other,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>A search led to the discovery of eight pieces of gold weighing a total of nearly 4.2 pounds. </p>
      <p>“The ingots had been attached to the insoles of her shoes with duct tape,” the statement said, adding that the value of the find is estimated at more than $79,000.</p>
      <p>The bars have been made illegally and lacked the necessary documents.</p>
      <p>Authorities opened a criminal case, saying the woman had tried to smuggle out the gold at the request of a Chinese citizen.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the year officials have repeatedly detained Russians trying to smuggle gold into China, Boiko said.</p>
      <p>In August, a Russian woman was caught carrying 10 gold ingots in her trainers.</p>
      <p>Gold panning is widespread in Siberia. </p>
      <p>At least 17 people were killed during a dam collapse at an artisanal gold mine in Siberia last month.</p>
