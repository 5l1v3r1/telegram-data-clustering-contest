      <h2>Council chiefs said a dozen people could have been arrested on a night of violence they witnessed on the streets.</h2>

      <p>Drugs are rife inside clubs and pubs as police struggle to cope with 3.30am openings in Ayr, a councillor said. </p>
      <p>South Ayrshire politicians witnessed a fight in Arthur Street as they toured venues to see what police face every week. </p>
      <p>Another councillor told the licensing board said a dozen people could have been arrested that night. </p>
      <p>Police are now monitoring four venues after a number of issues came to light during another patrol.</p>
      <p>Licensing board chair Craig Mackay said: “Drugs are a big issue. We are aware that drugs are quite rife within licensed premises.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The premises are aware of the drugs problem. They want to overcome it but it is very difficult.”</p>
      <p>The councillor added: “How can you deal with somebody going into the toilet taking drugs? “Do you confront them?”</p>
      <p>Board members went on a tour of nightspots in Ayr and Prestwick on July 27 and saw a fight erupt in Arthur Street.</p>
      <p>Councillor Mackay described it as a scuffle and said police had to try and break it up. No arrests were made.</p>
      <p>The Troon politician said: “If the police arrest someone that is two officers out of action for the rest of the night.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Bob Pollock, a former police inspector said: “You probably could have jailed a dozen people that night.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The statistics you see from police don’t reflect what is happening on the ground. “Police are stopping fights happening.”</p>
      <p>Ayr nightspots Madisons and Vinyl are being monitored by police along with two other venues, according to a report by Chief Inspector Brian Anderson.</p>
      <p>The area commander hit the streets with officers on August 31 from 10pm to 4am to see what they have to deal with first hand.</p>
      <p>A number of people were  given warnings by officers.</p>
      <p>The chief inspector’s report said a number of licensing issues were uncovered at the four venues.</p>
      <p>But the police chief said he could not release further details when asked by the Ayrshire local democracy reporting service. </p>
      <p>The 3.30am closures at Madisons and Vinyl cost £400 in police overtime on August 31, according to the report. </p>
      <p>It also had an impact on officers being able to start a late shift the following day as they need 11 hours off between spells of duty. </p>
      <p>The licensing board is reviewing the future of late closures in the area and a decision is expected at the next meeting.</p>
      <p>But pubs and clubs say extended hours are vital to host popular DJs and celebrities, which draw the crowds in.</p>
