      <h1>'The Little Mermaid' Live-Action Movie Cast Includes Several A-List Celebs</h1>

      <p>On Nov. 5, ABC will air its musical special <i>The Little Mermaid Live!, </i>starring Auli'i Cravalho, Queen Latifah, Shaggy, and John Stamos, among others. But it's not the only <i>Little Mermaid</i> project slated to hit screens: Disney's live-action film adaptation is currently in production, with a release date yet to be announced. The <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-little-mermaid/283743/little-mermaid-remake-movie-cast">live-action <i>Little Mermaid </i>cast</a> is completely separate from ABC's live version, but the two casts do have at least one thing in common: they're notably more diverse than their animated 1989 predecessor. The live-action take also a similarly impressive slate of singers and actors ready to bring the magical tale back to life. Here's who's been announced so far.</p>
      <h3>Halle Bailey as Ariel</h3>
      <p>Halle Bailey, half of the R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle, will play Ariel in the new film. Outside of her music career, she's best known for playing the role of Skylar "Sky" Forster in <i>Grown-ish</i> alongside her sister and musical partner Chloe Bailey<i>.</i></p>
      <p>“After an extensive search, it was abundantly clear that <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-little-mermaid/282041/the-little-mermaid-remake-finds-ariel-halle-bailey">Halle possesses the rare combination</a> of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance — plus a glorious singing voice — all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role," director Rob Marshall said in a statement, per Den of Geek.</p>
      <p>Shortly after her casting, Bailey was the subject of some racist comments online, with a small but vocal minority of internet trolls pointing out that <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/08/07/little-mermaid-star-halle-bailey-says-she-doesnt-pay-attention-to-ariel-casting-backlash/">Ariel, a completely fictional mermaid</a>, has white skin and red hair.</p>
      <p>Bailey didn't let any of the comments bother her though; she told <i>Variety</i> that she doesn't "pay attention to the negativity." "It's going to be beautiful. I'm just so excited to be a part of it," she gushed.</p>
      <h3>Melissa McCarthy as Ursula</h3>

      <p>While it's yet to be confirmed, <i>Variety</i> reported back in June that <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/melissa-mccarthy-little-mermaid-ursula-1203217481/">McCarthy is in talks to play Ursula</a>, the nefarious sea witch who steals Ariel's voice.</p>
      <p>It's a powerhouse role, and at the premiere of her film <i>The Kitchen</i>, McCarthy told <i>Variety </i>that she's excited to see <a href="https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/melissa-mccarthy-queen-latifah-little-mermaid-ursula-1203293451/">Queen Latifah play the notorious villain</a> in the TV musical as well. "She can do anything," McCarthy said. "I'll be like (raises hands) both hands on chin watching her."</p>
      <h3>Jacob Tremblay as Flounder</h3>

      <p>Like McCarthy, Bardem's role hasn't yet been confirmed, but he's <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/javier-bardem-talks-star-disneys-live-action-little-mermaid-1225058">in talks to play Ariel's stern father, King Triton</a>. Bardem has had numerous high-profile roles, including in <i>No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, Mother!, </i>and <i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i></p>
      <h3>Daveed Diggs as Sebastian</h3>

      <p>Diggs is <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/daveed-diggs-the-little-mermaid-cast-disney-1202755680/">in talks to play the musical crab Sebastian</a>. It's a fitting role for the actor/rapper, who made his first big splash by playing the first Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette in <i>Hamilton</i>. He's since been spotted in <i>Black-ish</i>, <i>Undone</i>, and <i>Velvet Buzzsaw</i>, and wrote and acted in his own film <i>Blindspotting</i>, which was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/07/blindspotting-review/565556/">highly praised on the film festival circuit.</a></p>
      <h3>Awkwafina as Scuttle</h3>

      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/jacob-tremblay-awkwafina-little-mermaid-1203257076/">Awkwafina is set to play Scuttle</a>, the eccentric seagull. Though originally a rapper, she's been moving more into acting in recent years, with roles in <i>Ocean's Eight, Crazy Rich Asians</i>, and the emotional indie film <i>The Farewell</i>.</p>
      <h3>Prince Eric</h3>
      <p>One of the major questions surrounding <i>The Little Mermaid </i>film is who's going to play Ariel's love interest. Initially it was reported that singer Harry Styles was the frontrunner<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-styles-explains-turning-down-little-mermaid-prince-eric-role-1237336"> </a>to play the role, but the casting never materialized.</p>
      <p>When asked why he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-styles-explains-turning-down-little-mermaid-prince-eric-role-1237336">turned down the role of Eric, Styles</a> explained to <i>The Face </i>magazine that he wanted to just "put music out and focus on that for a while." He continued to say he thinks "everyone involved in it is amazing" though, and that he'll "enjoy watching it, I’m sure."</p>
      <p>Right now, Deadline reports that Cameron Cuffe (Seg-El in <i>Krypton) </i>and Jonah Hauer-King (2017's <i>Little Women</i>) are <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/09/the-little-mermaid-prince-eric-cameron-cuffe-jonah-hauer-king-testing-role-1202743642/">currently in the running for Eric</a>.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
