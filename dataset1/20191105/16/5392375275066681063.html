      <p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/facebook-calibra-vp-product-kevin-weil-discusses-libra-at-web-summit.html">CNBC</a> reports, today, Facebook’s Kevin Weil, vice president of product at Facebook’s Calibra digital wallet unit, said that Facebook’s digital cryptocurrency Libra will not spread as quickly as a social media platform. He thinks it will take decades to become as popular as Facebook.</p>
      <p>Weil said at the ‘Web Summit’ tech conference today: ‘This is not going to be a thing that spreads like a social network. This is going to be the work not of years but of decades, and it’s worth making.’</p>

      <p>Since the Libra project was first announced in June this year, Facebook has been under tremendous regulatory pressure. The Libra Association is a Switzerland-based consortium overseeing the project. Last month, it lost multiple key initial backers including <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/02/visa-and-mastercard-rethinking-to-participate-in-libra/">Mastercard and Visa</a>.</p>
      <p>But Weil seems optimistic that other companies will join the Libra Association. He said: ‘18 months ago, this was an idea. Today we have 21 fantastic committed organizations that are members of the Libra Association; a bunch more that are looking to be involved. So expect that number to continue to grow.’</p>
      <p>Libra’s value will be tied to a basket of government currency and debt to maintain its stable value. Thus, it will perform like many so-called ‘stablecoins’ designed to avoid the volatility of digital cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Facebook said its main use will be for remittances. So consumers can send money across borders.</p>
      <p>The Facebook executive also said that Libra will solve some of the current problems with foreign exchange payments. For example, the average cost of current remittances is about 7% of the total transaction amount.</p>
