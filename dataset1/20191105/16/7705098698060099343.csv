The His Dark Materials cast also includes Dafne Keen (Logan), James McAvoy (Dark Phoenix), as well as Ruth Wilson (Luther) and Lin-Manuel Miranda (Mary Poppins Returns). In a parallel universe where all humans have animal companions called dæmons, the young Lyra, living a sheltered life among the academics at Jordan College, Oxford, discovers a dangerous secret.
Other cast members include Anne-Marie Duff (Suffragette) as Ma Costa, James Cosmo (Game of Thrones) as Farder Coram, Lucien Msamati (Richard II) as John Faa, Mat Fraser (Cast Offs) as Raymond Van Geritt, as well as Geoff Bell (War Horse) as Jack Verhoeven, and Simon Manyonda (King Lear) as Benjamin de Ruyter.
Part of Philip Pullman’s trilogy was previously transported to the big screen in The Golden Compass. The 2007 movie starred Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, as well as Dakota Blue Richards, and Eva Green. Chris Weitz’s movie, though, covered just Pullman’s first novel, also called Northern Lights.
The next episode of His Dark Materials will air on November 11 on HBO. What do you think about His Dark Materials premiere? Let us know your impression in the comments section below.
