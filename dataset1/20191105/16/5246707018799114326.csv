Co-Op Puzzle Platformer Degrees Of Separation Gets Free Online Multiplayer Update
And you'll keep your progress, too
05 Nov 2019, 16:15 by Ryan Craddock



Co-op platformer Degrees of Separation has received a free update today which adds online multiplayer into the mix.
The game, which uses contrasting aspects of heat and cold to guide players through its fantasy world, can be played either alone or with a friend in co-op. Until now, the co-op has been a local-only affair, but you can now go ahead and join up with a friend online, too.
Welcomingly, you can actually take your existing save file online to play with friends, and any progress earned through cooperative play will be kept by each user. Nice.












If you don't already own the game, you can go ahead and download it as we speak from the Nintendo Switch eShop. You'll find it waiting for you for £15.49 / $19.99.
