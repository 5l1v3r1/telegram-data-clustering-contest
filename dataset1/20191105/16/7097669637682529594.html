      <p>A Florida woman used a rifle to defend her home against two armed intruders who demanded money from her husband, killing one man, police said.</p>
      <p>The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office confirmed two men broke into a home in Lithia and "made demands" of the homeowners. The woman, who, according to local reports is 8 months pregnant, fired one shot from a gun that was in the house after the intruders attacked her husband, according to police.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HCSOSheriff/videos/802781300142253/">Maj. Frank Losat</a> told reporters that the sheriff's office received a call about the incident just before 9 p.m. Wednesday. Emergency responders arrived at the scene and found one of the two intruders dead in a ditch.</p>
      <p>In a Monday email, sheriff's spokeswoman Crystal Clark told USA TODAY that the second intruder was still at-large. Clark said it was "unclear" exactly what kind of gun the woman used in the incident, though Clark said it was a rifle. </p>

      <p>The gun used by the woman was in the house legally, Losat said. He added that the man who was attacked was taken to a hospital. Clark said the woman was not hurt. </p>

      <p>King added his wife is 8 months pregnant, according to the news station. </p>
      <p>“They came in heavily hooded and masked," King told Bay News 9. "As soon as they had got the back door opened, they had a pistol on me and was grabbing my 11-year-old daughter."</p>
      <p>Losat said authorities don't believe the home invasion was random. <a href="https://teamhcso.com/news/pressrelease/67ec0ea9-5e6b-4ade-b1be-dd34747dd500/19-385">The sheriff's office reiterated that in a news release</a>.</p>
      <p>"We also know that this was not a random act, that this family was probably targeted," Losat said. </p>
