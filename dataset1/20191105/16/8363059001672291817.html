      <h1>Original Google Pixel No Longer Receiving Security Updates</h1>

      <p>Google just released a November update for Pixel phones... and there was something missing.</p>
      <p>The original Google Pixel and Pixel XL were MIA from the device list.</p>
      <p>After its release in October 2016, it looks like the Pixel that started it all may be finally be getting put out to pasture.</p>
      <p>I guess Google weren't joking about providing precisely three years of updates for its devices. As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-november-19-security-patch/">9To5Google</a> points out, it's possible that the update has merely been delayed for these users, though considering the timing it seems unlikely.</p>
      <p>Google's Pixel <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">support page</a> also lists October 2019 as the end of the original Pixel's minimum support and update period, stating they won't be guaranteed after October 2019.</p>

      <p>If you do have an original Pixel, it is probably time to prepare for a life without Pixel-specific bug fixes or security updates.</p>
      <p>Gizmodo has reached out to Google for confirmation regarding being dropped from the update list. [<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-november-19-security-patch/">9To5Google</a>]</p>
