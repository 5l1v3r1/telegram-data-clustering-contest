NATO's death mask- Macron
07 Nov 2019, 19:53 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

French President Emmanuel Macron said NATO's plans for the deadline, monitoring the misunderstanding between the United States and Europe, and Turkey's position in launching an attack on Syria.

President Macron said in an interview with The Economist magazine that he said there was ""no clear plan for reconciliation between the United States and other NATO member states.""
The president lamented that Turkey, which is a NATO member, has taken decisive action in Syria, a country that he said has been threatened by its policies.
Macron's comments, however, have raised the question as to the fate of this NATO alliance, which is scheduled to hold its summit next month in the UK.
The president added that as NATO members, they must acknowledge that they are facing serious problems, as he warns the United States of America's stand-off for the organization.
The Russian government has since paid tribute to Macron's comments, describing his comments with caution.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel dismissed Macron's remarks, saying there was no need to impose such a hasty judgment on the organization even in the face of difficulties.
NATO President Jens Stoltenberg emphasizes that the organization is still under its control, and that the US and European powers are working together more than ever before.
