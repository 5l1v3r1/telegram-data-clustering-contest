        <i>Friday: French president criticises US actions in Syria and says Europe may need to defend itself. Plus: David Marr speaks to author Christos Tsiolkas</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 8 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>Emmanuel Macron has launched a remarkable broadside at Donald Trump,</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/macron-warns-of-nato-brain-death-as-us-turns-its-back-on-allies">saying the US’s recent actions in Syria signified “brain death” for the Nato alliance</a>, while flagging that European nations may not be able to rely on the US to defend its allies. The French president accused Washington of “turning its back on us” by not consulting leading European powers such as Britain, Germany or France before paving the way for Turkey to launch a polarising military offensive into Syria. Macron described Europe as “on the edge of precipice”<i><b> </b></i>and in need of its own military force.</p>
      <p><b>Losing money, facing deregistration, unlikely to happen for another two years</b> – that’s the assessment of a Queensland venture that was awarded a $1m government grant to boost regional jobs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/08/bus-and-ferry-project-that-received-1m-coalition-regional-grant-delayed-and-losing-money">according to a scathing report from the auditor general</a>. One of 200 companies to receive a federal investment grant, Dindarr Pty Ltd had no previous experience in the transport sector but was looking to set up “fast, low-cost ferry and bus services” between Cairns and the Yarrahbah Indigenous community. The company’s director, Peter McAllister, confirmed he has already had to lay off three bus drivers, but remained confident total staff could number 12 by mid-2020.</p>
      <p><b>Anthony Albanese will attempt to draw a line under Labor Party recriminations,</b> as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/08/anthony-albanese-to-try-and-turn-page-on-election-loss-amid-unrest-from-shorten-camp">he publicly presents an internal review’s key findings</a> into the May federal election loss. Weak strategy, poor adaptability and an unpopular leader were the key factors offered by the report. Albanese will also use his press club address to outline future recommendations, including caps on individual donations and legislation governing truth in political advertising.</p>

      <p><b>A master of squalor and cruelty, acclaimed author Christos Tsiolkas has turned his hand to Jerusalem and Antioch post-Jesus, in his new book, Damascus.</b> “This is a novel that mourns what the world might have been, had bickering Christians back then agreed on a kinder version of Christ’s message,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/08/shame-squalor-and-the-birth-of-the-christian-church-christos-tsiolkass-wild-ride-to-damascus">writes David Marr</a>. It’s a novel treating a “lifetime’s reckoning” with the seminal messenger of Christianity, Paul: “a stuttering zealot with a high-pitched voice … who masters himself, his rivals and his last doubts to remake the world”.</p>
      <p><b>What does treasure hunting look like in the 21st century? </b>Well, for starters, some modern-day bullion chasers prefer the term “archaeo-metal detectorist”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/08/theres-a-treasure-hunter-in-everyone-meet-the-australians-who-discover-hidden-riches">writes Jeff Sparrow</a>, who speaks to three fascinating Australians, hunting everything from lost wedding rings to Spanish doubloons.</p>
      <p><b>There are two months left of the 2010s – which begs the question: what will </b><i><b>now </b></i><b>look like later? </b>Imagine in 30 years the 2010s as a theme party, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/flower-crowns-sneakers-and-espresso-martinis-what-will-it-be-like-to-be-nostalgic-for-the-2010s">writes Brigid Delaney</a>. Maxi dresses, salmon-pink shirts for men, sneakers instead of stilettos – for drinks there are espresso martinis, prosecco and hyper-local small batch gin. Food is poke bowls, cronuts and share plates. “Since being banned by President Donald Trump at the end of the decade, vaping has gone underground. So in a smoky cloud of nostalgia that feels very 2017, vapers inhale a cinnamon and strawberry donut flavoured Juul.”</p>

      <p><b>Australia has the most diverse birdlife on Earth</b> and Australians in cities, suburbs and country towns have a special relationship with our boisterous and beautiful feathered friends. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/nov/08/whats-the-big-deal-about-bird-of-the-year">In this episode of Full Story</a>, Birdlife Australia’s Sean Dooley talks to Laura Murphy-Oates about what makes these relationships unique and listeners call in to tell their best avian anecdotes. But with an endangered bird currently in the lead for the 2019 Australian bird of the year, Dooley and Murphy-Oates consider whether we are looking after our diverse birdlife well enough?</p>
