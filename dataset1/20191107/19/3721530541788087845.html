      <p>Do you know what’s fantastic about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-outer-worlds/40458"><i>The Outer Worlds</i></a>? It’s about 20 hours, maybe a little more if you want to take your time with it. All of those 20 hours are a good time, and then the game’s done! There’s no more!</p>
      <p>I wish more games would follow in Obsidian’s footsteps here, because I’m realizing that I have no more patience left for the 100-plus-hour RPG. Sometimes, a game catches my attention. Perhaps the combat looks excellent, or the protagonist seems cool. And then the hype train begins: “<i>Hundreds</i> of hours of deep and complex quest content,” the game promises. “An ongoing narrative that requires your constant attention. You’ll collect a party of characters you love like your own family — and choices you make can crop up 40 minutes later to devastate them.”</p>
      <p>Every time I hear a game described in this way, I break out into a cold sweat. That’s not exciting! That is a <i>threat</i>.</p>
      <h3>Those halcyon days of youth</h3>
      <p>When I was a teenager, I scraped together my part-time job money for an Xbox 360 and a copy of <i>Mass Effect</i>. It was the first system I purchased with my own money, and I was hooked. I played <i>Mass Effect</i> nine times before moving on to <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i> and sinking about 120 hours into that as well. I devoured <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> the following year. After growing up on Nintendo and Blizzard products, I was blown away by these dense, carefully constructed worlds.</p>
      <p>I don’t regret any of the time I spent with those games. To this day, they’re some of my favorites. There’s a certain level of emotional investment that comes from a long enough game. Take <i>Fallout</i><i>: New Vegas</i>. I still have very fond memories of when I awoke in Goodsprings and traversed across the Mojave Wasteland. I still remember the feeling of dread when I came across the Lottery, and the hate I felt when I realized who was behind it: the brutal ranks of Caesar’s Legion.</p>

      <p>A decade later, my buddies and I still swap stories about how our Couriers ruined the Legion’s day. My brother carefully collected Legion currency from around the map, smelted it down into bullets, and used a shotgun to render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s. I chose to bring my pal Boone into the camp and kill Caesar, then free his crucified enemies in the heart of his Nevada vanguard — a sign of my utter contempt for his rule.</p>
      <p>These stories are amazing, and they’re possible because they’re propped up by so much scaffolding of character development, world building, dialogue trees, and so on. Playing a long RPG with tons of choices is fantastic, but it also feels like a luxury of youth. I might knock one out over the Christmas holidays, but who has the time to play each big game as it comes out?</p>
      <h3>Not me, that’s who</h3>
      <p>Listen, I’m old and stupid and tired. I have a bunch of MMORPG subscriptions going at varying times to games like <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i><i> </i>and <i>World of Warcraft</i>, and every time I log into one of them after a few months off, I am immediately confused and frightened. Why do I have this grain? Where am I at, progression-wise? What are these crystals in my inventory? Wait, how’s my map rotate? <i>What are all of these buttons</i>?</p>
      <p>Jumping back into a 100-hour RPG has the same effect, but worse, because at least MMORPGs anticipate that you’ll take time off. Logging back into a massive story-driven RPG after taking a break to deal with real life is a nightmare. I have 50 markers on my map. One of my companions is mad at me because I ... did something, somewhere.</p>
      <p>At some point, I picked up 30 gems. Why do I have so many gems? Turns out that I bought them en masse to give to another companion every day, and I need to do that because I shattered the God Urn and trashed our relationship. Listen, I have enough trouble tracking my real-life social obligations and long-term grudges, I can’t do it with a bunch of elves or space marines as well.</p>

      <p>Now, <i>The Outer Worlds</i> certainly had some complex relationship stuff going on ... but everything is<a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2019/10/28/20932629/the-outer-worlds-quest-log-recap-adult-players"> tracked and recorded in my quest log</a>, and 20 hours isn’t long enough for me to forget stuff established in the early game. It’s the best of both worlds between a short game and a mega-RPG.</p>
      <p>I just have stuff going on in real life that cuts down on my gaming time — and it’s literally my job to be involved in video games! I can’t imagine how much worse it would be if I had an office job, or if my husband and I had kids. As it is, real life occasionally crashes over me and knocks me off my feet. How are people supposed to gobble down a 100-hour game? In <i>today’s</i> economy?</p>
      <p>Games like <i>Sea of Thieves</i> and <i>Warframe</i> are much more based on session-to-session gameplay; I don’t remember many of my early adventures, and that’s totally OK. For now, I think I’ll be sticking to those online games, or working on short stories here and there. <i>The Outer Worlds</i> was so deeply satisfying because it stayed in its 20-hour lane. I just wish more developers would follow suit.</p>
