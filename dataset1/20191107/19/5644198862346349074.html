      <p>The authorities said they detected "multiple hygiene lapses" during their investigation. </p>
      <p>"All food handlers working in the suspended premises are required to re-attend and pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course before they can resume work as food handlers," said MOH and SFA. </p>
      <p>Appointed food hygiene officers working at the company are also required to re-attend and pass the Food Hygiene Office Course before they can resume work as officers. </p>
      <p>The company is also required to clean and sanitise the premises, including equipment and utensils. </p>
      <p>"Food safety is a joint responsibility. SFA would like to remind food operators to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times," said the release. </p>
      <p>SFA added that it will not hesitate to take firm action against anyone found to be in violation of the Environmental Public Health Act.</p>
