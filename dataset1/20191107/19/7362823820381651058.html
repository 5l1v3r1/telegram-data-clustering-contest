      <p>"The Costume Institute's spring 2020 exhibition will trace more than a century and a half of fashion — from 1870 to the present — along a disruptive timeline, as part of The Met's 150th-anniversary celebration," the Met announced in a <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/about-time">press release</a>.</p>

      <p>The concept borrows from "Henri Bergson's concept of la durée (duration)" and "will explore how clothes generate temporal associations that conflate past, present, and future."</p>
      <p>Virginia Woolf will serve as the "ghost narrator" of the exhibition, the Met revealed.</p>
      <p>The gala launches the spring exhibit, which will run from May 7 through Sept. 7.</p>
