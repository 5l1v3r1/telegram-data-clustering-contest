      <p>Munich - <b>Bayern Munich </b>have turned down an approach from<b> Arsene Wenger</b> to take over the vacant manager's position following the sacking of Niko Kovac, the German champions said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Arsene Wenger called (Bayern chairman) Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Wednesday afternoon to make him aware of his interest in the job," a Bayern spokesperson told AFP subsidiary SID.</p>
      <p>"Bayern appreciates Wenger's work at Arsenal, but he is not being considered as coach."</p>
      <p>Kovac was dismissed at the weekend following a poor run of form that culminated in a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern's worst Bundesliga defeat in a decade and one which left them fourth in the table.</p>
      <p>Kovac's assistant Hansi Flick has taken over as interim coach as Bayern search for a more permanent replacement, with club president Uli Hoeness saying on Tuesday they expected to name Kovac's successor by November 23.</p>
      <p>However they have been publicly rebuffed by both Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel and Ajax's Erik ten Hag, who said on Monday he would be staying with the Dutch champions until at least the end of the season.</p>
