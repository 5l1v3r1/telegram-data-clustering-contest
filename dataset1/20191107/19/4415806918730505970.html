      <p>A declaration has been signed by law makers from seven countries to advance international collaboration on the regulation of social media.</p>
      <p>It aims to combat harmful content, hate speech and electoral interference online.</p>
      <p>The countries that signed up to the principles are Ireland, Australia, Finland, Estonia, Singapore, UK and USA.</p>
      <p>Members of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and 'Fake News' signed the agreed principles in Leinster House this evening, at the end of a day-long meeting in the Seanad Chamber.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Hildegarde Naughton said: “In addition to the set of principles, we have all agreed that individual States should put in place a moratorium on micro-targeted political advertising that contains false or misleading information until such time as regulation is in place.”</p>
      <p>She said the issue of misleading political ads online was a common theme during the day’s evidence.</p>
      <p>It was the third meeting of the ICG. The ICG met for the first time in Westminster at the end of 2019 and in Ottawa in May 2019.</p>
