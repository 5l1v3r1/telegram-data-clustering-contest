      <p>NEW YORK -- A New York judge on Thursday ordered U.S. President Donald Trump to pay US$2 million to an array of charities to resolve a lawsuit alleging he misused his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests.</p>
      <p>Judge Saliann Scarpulla said Trump breached his fiduciary duty to the Trump Foundation by allowing his campaign staff to plan a fundraiser for veterans' charities in the run-up to the 2016 Iowa caucuses.</p>
      <p>The event, which passed money through Trump's non-profit, was designed "to further Mr. Trump's political campaign," Scarpulla said.</p>
      <p>The judge also signed off on agreements reached last month between Trump's lawyers and the New York attorney general's office to close the Trump Foundation and distribute about $1.7 million in remaining funds to other nonprofits.</p>
      <p>In the agreements, Trump admitted to personally misusing Trump Foundation funds and agreed to pay back $11,525 in the organization's funds he spent on sports memorabilia and champagne at a charity gala. He also agreed to restrictions on his involvement in other charitable organizations.</p>
      <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James heralded the resolution of the case as a "major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain."</p>
      <p>"No one is above the law -- not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States," said James, a Democrat.</p>
