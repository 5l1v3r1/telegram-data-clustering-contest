      <p>Rajkot - Skipper <b>Rohit Sharma </b>smashed 85 in his 100th <b>Twenty20 </b>international to power India to an eight-wicket series-levelling win over <b>Bangladesh</b> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sharma put on 118 runs with opening partner Shikhar Dhawan as the hosts achieved their target of 154 in only 15.4 overs in Rajkot to make the three-match series 1-1.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old raced to his fifty in just 23 deliveries, reaching the milestone with his third six.</p>
      <p>He hammered six fours and six maximums in total, including three successive hits over the fence off spinner Mosaddek Hossain in his 43-ball blitz.</p>
      <p>"I knew that Rajkot is a good track, knew (it) will be difficult for bowlers in the second innings," said Sharma, who is leading the side in the absence of the rested Virat Kohli.</p>
      <p>"We took advantage of that, had a great powerplay. After that, it was all about going on.</p>
      <p>"I never underestimate bowlers. All these years, I've just tried to do my best with the bat in hand. Knew conditions were perfect, so all I wanted to do was stay still and tonk the ball."</p>
      <p>He is the only male Indian cricketer to play a century of T20 internationals and just the second worldwide, with Pakistan's Shoaib Malik having played 111.</p>
      <p>Sharma finally became leg-spinner Aminul Islam's second victim after being caught at deep mid-wicket.</p>
      <p>Dhawan was bowled by Aminul for 31.</p>
      <p>Shreyas Iyer, on 24, and KL Rahul, on eight, were at the crease as India won with 26 balls to spare.</p>
      <p>Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal set up the victory by taking two key wickets in one over to help restrict Bangladesh to 153 for six after being put in to bat first.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh made a flying start with Liton Das and Mohammad Naim, the top scorer with 36, putting on 60 for the opening wicket in 7.1 overs.</p>
      <p>Liton benefited from a pair of reprieves, including a stumping chance when a no-ball was called after wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant collected the ball in front of the stumps.</p>
      <p>Liton was finally run out by a direct throw from Pant while trying to steal a single after missing a googly from Chahal.</p>
      <p>Chahal then struck twice in his third over with the wickets of first-match hero Mushfiqur Rahim, for four, and Soumya Sarkar, for 30, as the tourists slipped to 103 for four.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh lost two more wickets, including skipper Mahmudullah Riyad for 30, in the last five overs that resulted in 41 runs.</p>
      <p>"Was a very good wicket, but we were 25-30 runs short. Having said that, credit to Rohit and Shikhar, how they started. Momentum went their way," said Mahmudullah.</p>
      <p>"We need to assess the conditions when we go to Nagpur. We needed to be a bit more positive."</p>
      <p>The final match is on Sunday in Nagpur.</p>
