The View host tells Don Trump Jr. 'my law degree says' exposing whistleblower is a crime
07 Nov 2019, 19:33 by John Gage
ABC's The View host Sunny Hostin tore into Donald Trump Jr. during his appearance on the show after he posted the name of the alleged whistleblower, Eric Ciaramella, on Twitter.
""Kimberly, you’re a lawyer, and we've known each other. You were a former prosecutor. I mean, did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?"" Hostin asked Kimberly Guilfoyle, Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, who was also on the Thursday episode of the show.
Trump Jr. cut in and told Hostin, ""It's not a federal crime. It's only a federal crime for the IG to do it.""
""That's not true. That's a lie,"" the host said, adding, ""my law degree says it is"" after Trump Jr. continued to disagree with her.
Trump Jr. tweeted an article Wednesday naming the whistleblower as Ciaramella. The president's son said he did not regret tweeting out the name despite significant backlash from the media.
He also ripped the network for what he said was hypocrisy for getting their own ""whistleblower"" fired for leaking video of an ABC host admitting the network spiked the Jeffrey Epstein story three years ago.
