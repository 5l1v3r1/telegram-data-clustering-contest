      <h1>Kate Ramsden: Labour election candidate quits after likening Israel to a child abuser</h1>
      <h2>Resignation comes as John McDonnell is criticised for claiming Labour has done all that has been asked to tackle its antisemitism problem</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:52:23+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Merrick</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/labour">Labour</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/general-election">general election</a> candidate has quit after it emerged she likened the actions of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/israeli-government">Israeli government</a> to those of a child abuser.</p>
      <p>Kate Ramsden stood down over a blog post in which she also reportedly alleged that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/antisemitism">antisemitism</a> claims against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> were “orchestrated by the wealthy establishment”.</p>
      <p>The candidate, for the Scottish constituency of Gordon, said she was resigning for “personal reasons” after being challenged by the party, Labour said.</p>
      <p>The controversy blew up as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JohnMcDonnell">John McDonnell</a>, the shadow chancellor, came under fire for claiming Labour had done all the Jewish community had asked for to tackle its antisemitism problem.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jewish-labour-movement">Jewish Labour Movement</a> said the reality was that it “had been shunned and our views ignored”, adding: “There are hundreds of outstanding cases yet to be resolved.”</p>
      <p>“They have not instituted an independent education programme for members. New procedures make political interference in blocking discipline for anti-Jewish racists worse, not better.”</p>
      <p>Ms Ramsden was thrust into the spotlight after <i>The Jewish Chronicle</i> reported that she wrote in the blog: “To me the Israeli state is like an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.”</p>
      <p>The report said she added: “Like child abuse it has to stop... as we intervene with child abusers the international community needs to intervene with Israel.”</p>
      <p>She also wrote of her opposition to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/international-holocaust-remembrance-alliance">International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance</a> (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which was eventually implemented by the party after a long row.</p>
      <p>The website claimed it had evidence that she had initially been allowed to stand provided she deleted the blog post, but this was strongly denied by Labour.</p>

      <p>“We took immediate action to have Kate Ramsden’s candidacy reconsidered in light of the material that we found,” a party source said.</p>
      <p>“Staff in Labour HQ found these posts when conducting extra due diligence checks. Staff immediately alerted Scottish Labour, who informed the Scottish Executive Committee, which decided to re-interview Kate Ramsden about the new posts that had been found.</p>
      <p>“Kate Ramsden stood down as a candidate and is therefore not a Labour candidate in the election. The party took swift and robust action on this matter.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, a former Labour stalwart, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ian-austin">Ian Austin</a>, urged people to vote for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> instead of Jeremy Corbyn as he announced he was quitting parliament.</p>
      <p>The former Labour minister said “decent traditional patriotic Labour voters” should vote Tory, after previously condemning a “culture of extremism, antisemitism and intolerance”.</p>
      <p>But Mr McDonnell, on the campaign trail in Liverpool, insisted: “Everything that has been asked of us by the Jewish community we’ve done.</p>
      <p>“We were asked to look at antisemitism in the party and we’ve done a detailed investigation. We’ve identified a small, a tiny number, of antisemitic activities and we’ve dealt with it.</p>
      <p>“We were asked to ensure we had disciplinary procedures that were fast, and I was saying ruthless as well, and that’s what we’ve done. We’ve expelled people.”</p>
