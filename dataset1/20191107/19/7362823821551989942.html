      <h1>Demi Moore says Ashton Kutcher's opinions on alcoholism helped convince her to end her sobriety</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:15:58+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/demi-moore">Demi Moore</a> reiterated claims that her ex-husband <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Ashton Kutcher</a> contributed to her breaking her 20-year sobriety by questioning whether alcoholism is even real.</p>
      <p>The actress, 56, appeared alongside her daughters, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/demi-moore-rumer-willis-couldnt-stand-relationship-ashton-kutcher">Tallulah and Rumer Willis</a>, on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jada-pinkett-smith">Jada Pinkett Smith’s</a> Facebook Watch series “Red Table Talk” and got candid about her life and her struggles with addiction.</p>
      <p>“I opened that door to drinking after almost 20 years,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redtabletalk/videos/465616097634111/">Moore told hosts</a> Jada Pinkett Smith, Willow Smith and Adrienne Banfield-Norris. “I ended up pregnant and then I lost the baby at almost six months. When I couldn’t get pregnant again, the guilt that I felt, that it was clearly my fault, was just enormous.”</p>

      <p>The actress explained that an offhand comment from Kutcher made her question her sobriety program.</p>
      <p>“Ashton said, ‘I don’t know if alcoholism’s a thing. I think it’s about moderation,'” Moore claimed. “If I had stayed close to working my program ... I, of course, lived the majority of my adult life sober. I was great sober.”</p>

      <p>Although it may sound like Moore blames Kutcher for falling off the wagon, she noted that the decision was ultimately hers.</p>

      <p>“I made my own story up, that he wanted somebody that he could have wine with, that he could do stuff [with]. He’s not the cause of why I opened that door up,” she continued. “I wanted to be something other than who I am. And I gave my power away.”</p>
      <p>Moore’s comments echo her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rob-lowe-demi-moore-sobriety">tell-all book “Inside Out,”</a> in which she told the story in a bit more detail.</p>
      <p>“One night we put some clothes on and went out to dinner. Ashton was enjoying a glass of good red wine when he said, ‘I don’t know if alcoholism is a real thing. I think it’s all about moderation.'”</p>

      <p>She continued: “I wanted to be that girl. The girl who could have a glass of wine at dinner, or do a tequila shot at a party. In my mind, Ashton wanted that too. So I tried to become that: a fun, normal girl.”</p>
