      <h1>Harley-Davidson offers a sneak peek of its new electric bikes, going on sale in 2020</h1>
      <h2>But we want to ride them now</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:10:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>One of the most hotly anticipated electric bicycles scheduled to be released in 2020 isn’t from a traditional bike manufacturer, or even some new crowdfunding e-bike startup, but from one of the oldest motorcycle companies in the world. We’ve known for a few years now that Harley-Davidson is working on a whole lineup of battery-powered vehicles, including a motorcycle, several pedal-assist bikes, and a scooter-moped concept. This week, the company helped whet our appetites by sending us some pictures so we could get a closer look at the pre-production designs.</p>

      <p>The pictures are nice to look at, but riding them would be even sweeter. Prototype versions of Harley-Davidson’s new e-bikes actually made their public debut this week at the 2019 EICMA Motorcycle Show in Milan. (<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/05/harley-davidsons-electric-bicycles-get-their-first-public-debut/'"><i>Electrek </i>was on the scene</a> and got some more photos.) They haven’t been named yet, but a spokesperson for the company says it’s still “evaluating market opportunities and finalizing design details” before they go into production in 2020.</p>

      <p>There are three styles of bike with varying degrees of accessibility: a high-step model, a step-through model, and one that’s in between. All seem to be sporting mid-drive motors and internal removable batteries that sit flush with the frame. They have a very polished, premium look, putting them more in the realm of Trek’s Allant lineup than any sub-$1,000 e-bike you might find on Amazon.</p>

      <p>Harley-Davidson wouldn’t offer up any specs, so we can only speculate on battery size, range, and each model’s potential e-bike class. And still no word from the company as to whether it plans to put its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/3/18207435/harley-davidson-electric-scooter-concept-motorcycle-x-games-prototype">fun-looking electric moped</a> into production, which we first saw earlier this year. (Given the popularity and hype surrounding similar models from Juiced and Lithium Cycle, it would be wise for Harley-Davidson to jump on the bandwagon and put these bad boys on the streets.)</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Milwaukee-based company’s production of its electric LiveWire motorcycle is back on track after an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20921200/harley-davidson-livewire-charging-restart-production-deliveries">unspecified charging defect</a> led to a temporary halt of deliveries. The first customers of the $30,000 LiveWire just started receiving their orders in September.</p>
      <p>Harley-Davidson isn’t alone in jumping on the e-bike bandwagon. General Motors recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700439/gm-ariv-merge-meld-ebike-test-ride-speed-weight">started selling its own lineup of e-bikes</a> in Europe, while other automakers focus on electric scooters. In 2023, global sales of e-bikes are forecast to reach approximately 40 million units, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255653/worldwide-sales-of-electric-bicycles/">Statista.com</a>. It’s a sign that batter-powered mobility is quickly becoming a major market worldwide.</p>
