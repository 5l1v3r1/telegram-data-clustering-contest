      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:57:39+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361492-yellow-fever-outbreak-claims-29-lives-in-bauchi.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>An outbreak of yellow fever has killed at least 29 people in Bauchi State, the state has said.</p>
      <p>It is latest of such outbreaks in the country.</p>
      <p>Rilwanu Mohammed, chairman of the Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency spoke to journalists on Thursday about the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed said the virus was first detected in September, meaning the deaths were possibly recorded in the last two months.</p>
      <p>“We discovered 224 suspected cases, and 29 were confirmed dead, with 24 in Alkaleri local government, two in Bauchi local government, 1 in Darazo council area and two in Ningi local government,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed explained that the virus was first detected in Alkaleri local council area, adding that efforts had since been on to avoid further spread.</p>
      <p>He said the government was doing everything possible to ensure that the disease did not spread to the state capital.</p>
      <p>“That is why government has made efforts through vaccination of people living in the prone areas.</p>
      <p>“Already, 500,000 doses of vaccines had been administered in Alkaleri and we are expecting 600,000 doses of vaccines to be administered in Ningi community,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yellow fever is not a communicable disease. It can only be transmitted through mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed urged communities to give early information to the authorities, especially when they noticed unusual happenings around them.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammmed also urged the residents of the state not to reject vaccines, saying that this was the only way they could be free from the dreaded disease. (NAN)</p>
