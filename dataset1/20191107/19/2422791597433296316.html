      <p>SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile's president is announcing measures to increase security and toughen sanctions for vandalism following protests that have left at least 20 dead.</p>
      <p>President Sebastian Pinera said Thursday that the measures that he'll send to Congress include bills against looting and the destruction of property. He said that some will seek the re-enforcement of aerial surveillance and police intelligence to fight crime.</p>
      <p>The unrest began 21 days ago over a hike to subway fares, and it has grown into a massive movement demanding a broad range of changes.</p>
      <p>Most protests have been peaceful, but some have turned violent with daily clashes between police and demonstrators. There have been cases of arson and looting.</p>
