      <p>ABC's <i>The View</i> host Sunny Hostin tore into Donald Trump Jr. during his appearance on the show after he posted the name of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine">the alleged whistleblower</a>, Eric Ciaramella, on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Kimberly, youâ€™re a lawyer, and we've known each other. You were a former prosecutor. I mean, did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?" Hostin asked Kimberly Guilfoyle, Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, who was also on the Thursday episode of the show.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. cut in and told Hostin, "It's not a federal crime. It's only a federal crime for the IG to do it."</p>
      <p>"That's not true. That's a lie," the host said, adding, "my law degree says it is" after Trump Jr. continued to disagree with her.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/don-trump-jr-defiant-after-naming-whistleblower-as-eric-ciaramella">tweeted an article</a> Wednesday naming the whistleblower as Ciaramella. The president's son said he did not regret tweeting out the name despite significant backlash from the media.</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/don-trump-jr-rips-abc-on-the-view-for-hypocrisy-over-firing-their-own-whistleblower">ripped the network</a> for what he said was hypocrisy for getting their own <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cbs-news-fires-staffer-who-leaked-abc-news-video-about-epstein-cover-up-report">"whistleblower" fired</a> for leaking <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-had-it-all-abc-host-claims-network-squashed-epstein-story-three-years-ago-in-leaked-video">video of an ABC host admitting</a> the network spiked the Jeffrey Epstein story three years ago.</p>
