      <p>SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- Authorities say a massive wildfire that destroyed hundreds of homes and other buildings and forced thousands of people to evacuate in Northern California wine country has been fully contained.</p>
      <p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection made the announcement Wednesday night about the blaze that destroyed 174 homes and 200 other buildings.</p>
      <p>The fire ignited on Oct. 23 and drove nearly 200,000 people from their homes. It charred 121 square miles (313 square kilometre).</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is under investigation, but it's possible electrical equipment belonging to the state's largest utility was involved.</p>
      <p>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric had cut power to a large swath of people to prevent equipment from starting fires in windy weather, but it didn't de-energize a transmission tower near where the fire started.</p>
