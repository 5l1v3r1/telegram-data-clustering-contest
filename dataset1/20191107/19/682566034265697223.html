      <p>London - <b>Everton </b>midfielder <b>Andre Gomes</b> could play again before the end of the season after surgery on his broken ankle went well, his club manager <b>Marco Silva</b> said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Portuguese international suffered a fracture dislocation of the right ankle after being tripped by Tottenham Hotspur's Son Heung-min in Sunday's 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>Silva said the news from the club medical staff had been mildly encouraging following Monday's surgery and suggested a return could be feasible before the end of the campaign in mid-May.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy for us to give a sure date about when he will return," Silva said at his press conference ahead of this weekend's match with fellow strugglers Southampton.</p>
      <p>"What's in our mind and the feedback I have from our medical staff is that it's possible we will see Andre playing again this season.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it's not something we are 100 per cent sure about, but we have good possibilities to do that.</p>
      <p>"He is strong, he will keep strong for sure and will become stronger as a player."</p>
      <p>Silva, whose side are in need of points and lie just one place above the relegation zone, said he understood the distress of Son and Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier.</p>
      <p>Gomes fell awkwardly following the challenge from Son and his momentum carried him into Aurier.</p>
      <p>Son, whose red card was rescinded on appeal, was visibly distraught while Aurier had to be replaced soon afterwards due to being so upset.</p>
      <p>"Yes, I think he (Gomes) received a text message or something like that from Son," said Silva.</p>
      <p>"Of course that was a tougher moment for Andre, for sure, than all the others on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The toughest moment was for Andre, but of course for the two players who were involved, first Son and after, Aurier, it was really tough as well."</p>
