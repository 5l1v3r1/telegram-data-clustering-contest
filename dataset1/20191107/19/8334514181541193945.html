      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Roku Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ROKU.O">ROKU.O</a>) stock tumbled 11% on Thursday after the video streaming company gave a quarterly report that Wall Street deemed not good enough to justify its sky-high valuation.</p>

      <p>A major winner in the consumer shift away from cable television in favor of Netflix (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NFLX.O">NFLX.O</a>) and other over-the-top services, Roku’s stock remains up over 300% this year, even after Thursday’s retreat.</p>
      <p>Shares of the San Jose, California company, which reported a wider loss for the September quarter, are valued at an elevated 11 times revenue expected over the next 12 months, compared to a multiple of about 5 for streaming heavyweight Netflix, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>“We applaud management for driving substantial growth on a sound business model. However, we think shares are currently overvalued and expect volatility to persist,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter warned in a client note on Thursday, maintaining his neutral rating.</p>
      <p>Roku reported a September-quarter net loss and revenue that were better than analysts on average expected, according to Refinitiv. It raised its revenue guidance while trimming its outlook for adjusted EBITDA.</p>
      <p>Competition in the streaming market is increasing rapidly, with Walt Disney Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/DIS.N">DIS.N</a>) and Apple (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O">AAPL.O</a>) launching new services in November. AT&amp;T Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/T.N">T.N</a>) HBO Max and a new offering from Comcast Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/CMCSA.O">CMCSA.O</a>) are expected to enter the market next year.</p>
      <p>Reflecting growing competition in hardware used to deliver streaming services, Roku’s stock tumbled 28% over three days in September after Comcast said it would offer internet customers a streaming media set top box for free.</p>
      <p>As the streaming video market has become more crowded, Roku has shifted its focus from device sales to advertising, which is now the company’s fastest-growing revenue stream.</p>
      <p>At least two analysts increased their price targets for Roku following its report, while Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris cut his price target, maintaining his “buy” rating.</p>
      <p>Thirteen analysts recommend buying Roku’s stock, while four are neutral and two recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The analysts’ median price target is $150, which is 20% above Roku’s current price of $125.</p>
