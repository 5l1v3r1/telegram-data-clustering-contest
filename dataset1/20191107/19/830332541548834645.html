      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Several Wisconsin stadiums around the state were blanketed with snow after Wednesday's snowfall.</p>
      <p>All across the state, from Madison to Green Bay, sports stadiums got a fresh blanket of snow. Some of Wisconsin's sports teams embraced the snow, while others shied away from it.</p>
      <p>Lambeau Field got a fresh coat of snow ahead of the Packers' game against the Panthers that's set for Nov. 10.</p>

      <p>The snow even prompted Packers quarter back Aaron Rodgers to throw a snowball or two during practice.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the untouched snow at Breeze Stevens Field, home to Forward Madison FC, made the perfect spot for a potential snowball fight. Rodgers probably would have jumped in on the action.</p>

      <p>While Rodgers may have enjoyed the snow at Lambeau Field, the Madison Mallards mascot Maynard didn't seem too thrilled with the flurries.</p>
