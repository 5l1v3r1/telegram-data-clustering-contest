Daniel Sturridge makes 'crazy' transfer admission after Aston Villa rumour
Latest Aston Villa transfer news | Sturridge was linked with AVFC in the summer after being released by Liverpool

Daniel Sturridge has opened up on his love for Liverpool – and admitted his summer move to Turkey was ‘crazy’.
The striker was linked with Aston Villa after his six-year spell with Liverpool came to an end when the Champions League winners released him.
Birmingham-born Sturrdige was on Villa's academy books before joining Coventry City at the age of 11 and later Manchester City.
He has become the ultimate 'one that got away' with Villa fans forced to watch on as he won the Champions League title at Chelsea in 2012 - a feat he matched with Liverpool in May - and became an England regular.
However, over the last few years Sturridge's career has been blighted by injuries and despite returning to full fitness last term he was barely used by Jurgen Klopp with Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Divock Origi the German's preferred options in attack
Villa were among a host of clubs credited with an interest in the 30-year-old, before he agreed a deal to join Trabzonspor.
Sturridge has been speaking about his summer decision and looked back on his time at Anfield with fondess.
He told De Marke Sports: ""For example, when I lived in Liverpool, the fans showed me a great love. I love Liverpool very much and I can still feel it in my heart.""
