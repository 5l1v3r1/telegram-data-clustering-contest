      <h1>Volcano sinks Pacific island — then forms a new one</h1>

      <p>Before and after images show the moment a new island is born in the South Pacific.</p>
      <p>A massive underwater volcano swallowed up an island in the South Pacific, but created an even bigger one just three weeks later.</p>
      <p>The eruption submerged the island of Lateiki — one of 170 that make up the archipelago of Tonga — took place 18 days ago, according to scientists.</p>

      <p>But an island three times its size has emerged 120-metres to the west of where Lateiki once was, said Taaniela Kula of the Geological Service of Tonga.</p>
      <p>Satellite images from the European Copernicus programme show the 100-metre long and 400-metre wide island, as well as what the area looked like before the eruption.</p>

      <p>Copernicus also captured the moment that the volcano erupted, on October 15.</p>
      <p>The new island is located between Kao and Late, in the Ha'apai Islands, an administrative division in the northern part of the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
      <p>Located 2,000 kilometers northeast of New Zealand and 650 kilometers east of Fiji, it is part of the Pacific’s "Ring of Fire" where continental plates collide frequently.</p>
      <p>A new island formed in 2014 is already rich with sea birds and plant life.</p>
