It’s not uncommon for politicians to team up with clergymen in order to boost their support among voters. Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon turned to Billy Graham, while president Obama turned to Rick Warren. Donald Trump, on the other hand, chose televangelist Paula White.

Donald Trump’s personal pastor angered netizens after a video was posted online in which the 53-year-old woman, among other things, said: ""If you are saying no to President Trump, you are saying no to God"". Ms White, who has recently joined the Trump administration and will conduct outreach among the president’s voter base, also said: “when I walk on White House grounds, God walks on White House grounds…where I stand is holy"".



​Most netizens were incensed at White’s comments, saying she doesn’t represent people who believe in God and is in fact a false prophet.
