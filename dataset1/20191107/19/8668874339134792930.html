      <h1>The clause that allows Toronto to pay Sonny Bill 40 times the average Super League salary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:41:42+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Sonny Bill Williams’ paycheck at the Toronto Wolfpack will be the value of an entire Super League salary cap thanks to a dispensation allowed within their league’s salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>Williams has signed a two-year deal worth around £2.6 million per year with Toronto, a move that would see him stay in the game until the 2021 RL World Cup.</p>
      <p>With the Super League salary cap set at £2 million, his bumper wage bill is worth more than an entire team’s allowance. The 34-year-old star’s reported pay packet is in fact 40 times that of the average Super League player (£65,000).</p>
      <p>The New Zealander will almost certainly come under the ‘Marquee Player’ rule, which states: ‘Each Super League and Championship Club is permitted to have two Marquee Players whose Salary Cap Value is limited to £150,000 (or £75,000 if Club Trained).’</p>

      <p>Because of the size of his salary he won’t come under the ‘Returning Talent Pool Dispensation’, which states: “Any Player who has not previously played Rugby League in the 5 years prior to signing is given a value of 50% of his true value in the first year of his contract and 75% of his true value in the second year.”</p>
      <p>However, this clause will likely be used should the Wolfpack come after the likes of Ben Te’o, the former NRL star who recently left <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester">Worcester</a> Warriors to return to Australia.</p>

      <p>If Toronto decide – as has been widely reported – to come after more rugby union stars, they will likely use the ‘New Talent Pool Dispensation’ clause. This states: “Any Player who has not previously played Rugby League is given a value of £0 in the first year of his contract and at 50% of his true value in the second year.”</p>
      <p>This would allow the Wolfpack to target the likes of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/manu-tuilagi/">Manu Tuilagi</a>, who they are reported to have shown an interest in. Tuilagi signed a contract extension with Tigers just last year and would have to be bought out of it by the newly rich Canadian outfit.</p>
