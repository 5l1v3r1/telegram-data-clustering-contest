      <h1>I Gave Up Dining Out For A Week. Here’s What I Learned</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:00:54+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Stephanie Coombes</a></address>
      <p>I’ll admit that, when I was challenged to give up dining out and ordering in for a week, I started looking for excuses to say no.</p>
      <p>I was concerned that the time and effort spent cooking would erode my precious, indolent, self-indulgent evenings. As someone who exists primarily on ready-made or delivered meals, I even Googled how long it would take for a person of my weight to starve to death (an insulting amount of time, it turns out – around two weeks).</p>
      <p>With no way out, I reluctantly agreed it was time to break a few bad habits and become better acquainted with my kitchen. I also figured it could be an interesting experiment in saving some serious coin.</p>
      <p>The thing is, I’m not a bad cook. I’m just tremendously lazy. Other, better people than me find chopping, boiling and stirring a therapeutic and mindful way to wind down after work. I find it dull drudgery. I believe staring at my phone and watch my takeaway food being delivered in real-time (“Cycle faster! Take the shortcut!”) is a much better use of my time and money.</p>
      <p>Deciding to do things properly, I set some strict parameters for the challenge. For seven days, starting on Monday, I decided to make absolutely no food or drink purchases from cafes, restaurants or food delivery apps. I also banished ready-made meals – a staple in my kitchen.</p>
      <p>Here’s how it went.</p>
      <h3>Brown Bananas And Gritty Instant Coffee</h3>

      <p>I launch into Monday totally unprepared. I haven’t left myself time to make lunch, so I grab a random assortment of things out of the fridge. I swoop out of my house late, flustered, and with a slice of cheese, two falafel balls of indeterminate age, and a couple of brown bananas crammed into my handbag</p>
      <p>I arrive at work desperately in need of a coffee. I’m halfway through the queue before I remember that store-bought drinks are off the list too. I settle instead for the gritty, instant coffee my office has provided and sip/chew my way through it at my desk. I radiate an aura so hostile no-one talks to me for the morning. That, at least, was a plus.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, I pick at my lunch (what could only be considered the world’s worst cheese platter), flick through recipes, and make a list for the week. Because saving money is the key, I decide to sample a new budget-busting pasta recipe from San Remo. I go for the suspiciously easy-looking <a href="https://sanremo.com.au/recipes/ready-pasta-spaghetti-with-green-beans-peas-walnuts/">Ready Pasta spaghetti with green beans, peas and walnuts</a>.</p>
      <p>Before heading home, I hit the supermarket and get everything on my list. This is easily the biggest shop I’ve done for months and with my reusable bags straining, I return home feeling virtuous.</p>
      <p>As someone who regards new recipes with the same level of suspicion as I do telemarketers, I’m very impressed by the pasta. I have enough leftovers for lunch the next day and glow with a sense of pride possibly disproportionate to my achievement.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Leftovers Kind Of Rule</h3>

      <p>As the week rolls on, I find myself anticipating my lunches, made from last-night’s dinners, with genuine excitement. I also have more time to enjoy my breaks, because I’m happily freed from the lunchtime crowd queues. And, in the evenings, cooking has become less onerous because I know the ingredients are waiting at home.</p>
      <p>The office coffee still sucks, though. I resent every grainy mouthful and long for creamy lattes and the short breaks that come with a trip to the cafe.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, while eating yoghurt-topped mango and muesli, a replacement for my usual cafe brunch, I do a little maths: I’ve saved roughly $125 so far. Over the course of a year, that could add up to a trip to Europe or the States. I decide to use a bit of that money on a nice bottle of wine and invite a couple of friends over for dinner. Because San Remo didn’t let me down earlier in the week, this time I try their <a href="https://sanremo.com.au/recipes/baked-mac-cheese-with-bacon-spinach/">Baked Mac and Cheese with bacon and spinach</a>. It looks like a crowd-pleaser and, frankly, if you don’t like mac and cheese, you’re no friend of mine.</p>
      <p>My guests enjoy the meal so much that, sadly, there are no leftovers. They also politely refrain from mentioning that this is the first time in roughly a decade that I’ve deviated from the three meals I usually rely on for entertaining.</p>
      <p>I make it to Sunday without breaking the challenge, but I finally succumb to temptation and buy a coffee from my local cafe. I sip it (feeling not one ounce of guilt) and reflect on how much easier than expected this week has been.</p>

      <h3>Yeah, I Cook Now</h3>

      <p>Like all things worth doing, kicking the take-away habit took a bit of preparation. But it paid off.</p>
      <p>My week has had more structure and I’ve less stressful food-related decisions to make. Doing just one big shop at the supermarket, rather than lots of little visits to grab microwave meals, freed up a lot of my afternoon. It also stopped me from making unhealthy spontaneous purchases, which add up over the course of a week.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, even after entertaining friends, the money I saved was significant. I can see myself adopting a lot of these habits long-term. All except one: you can pry barista-made coffees from my cold, dead hands.</p>
