      <p>Donald Trump’s personal pastor angered netizens after a video was posted online in which the 53-year-old woman, among other things, said: "If you are saying no to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911031077215064-over-two-dozen-spiritual-advisors-pray-for-president-trump-in-white-house-amid-impeachment-probe/">President Trump</a>, you are saying no to God". Ms White, who has recently joined the Trump administration and will conduct outreach among the president’s voter base, also said: “when I walk on White House grounds, God walks on White House grounds…where I stand is holy".</p>
