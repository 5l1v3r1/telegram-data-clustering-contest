      <p><b>SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Researchers say Rhode Island's rich, moist soil could make it a leader in the production of saffron, an expensive spice.</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports University of Rhode Island researchers found a test plot could yield 12 pounds (5.44 kilograms) of saffron per acre each year, more than double the harvest in Iran, which produces 90% of the world's saffron.</p>
      <p>Researchers say the domestic demand for saffron is on the rise, with 35 tons imported in 2016 and 50 tons predicted by 2021.</p>
      <p>Saffron is popular in Middle Eastern, Indian and other cuisines but has other uses.</p>
      <p>Wholesale prices run about $5,000 per pound. Consumers can pay $20 for a few threads of saffron and $95 for a quarter ounce.</p>
      <p>University researchers say saffron is expensive because it's difficult to harvest.</p>
