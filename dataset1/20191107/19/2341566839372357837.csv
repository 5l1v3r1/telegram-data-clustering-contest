綜合中國媒體報導，高峰7日下午在例行記者會表示，中美兩國牽頭人在過去2週妥善解決各自核心關切，進行認真、建設性的討論，同意隨協議進展，分階段取消加徵關稅。
他表示，若中美達成第一階段協定，應根據協定內容，同步等比率取消已加徵關稅，這是達成協議的重要條件。
高峰強調，中國對關稅問題的立場是一貫、明確的，貿易戰由加徵關稅而起，也應由取消加徵關稅而止。至於第一階段取消多少，可依該階段協議內容來商定。
至於中美下階段的貿易談判將在何時何地舉行，他說，目前尚無具體消息可透露。

對此，高峰表示，中國利用WTO規則維護合法權益，希望美方採取切實行動糾正錯誤做法，維護中美經貿關係健康發展。（編輯：沈朋達/楊昇儒）1081107
