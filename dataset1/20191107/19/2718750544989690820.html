      <h1><i>Derry Girls</i> Will Cross Over With <i>Great British Bake Off.</i> Hope You Like Soggy-Bottom Jokes!</h1>

      <p>When you think of wholesome holiday cheer, what do you envision? The smell of freshly baked cookies wafting through a pastoral English country manor? Or maybe a family, gathered around the telly to watch a good-natured, gentle dessert-based competition, wherein the contestants wear nice sweaters and hug? Replace the cookie smell with that of an active grease fire and the hugging with stern Catholic-school discipline and you probably have an idea of what the upcoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/great-british-baking-show-david-atherton-winner-interview.html"><i>Great Festive Bake Off</i></a><i> </i>featuring the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/netflix-derry-girls-northern-irish-family.html"><i>Derry Girls</i></a><i> </i>cast will look like. This New Year’s Day, Channel 4 is celebrating peace, love, and <i>craic </i>with a crossover event between everyone’s favorite streaming exports from opposite ends of the lawful-chaotic alignment spectrum.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Channel 4 <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolacoughlan/status/1192499399055810560">announced</a>: “Baking up some New Year’s-inspired bakes and competing for the coveted Star Baker title are Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, Dylan Llewellyn, and Siobhan McSweeney.” No, you didn’t fall asleep in front of Netflix and have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fsBNIBTuX8">crossover-episode dream</a> again. The actors who play Erin, Clare, Michelle, James, and Sister Michael really will face the judgment of Noel, Sandi, Prue, and Paul as they make … whatever “New Year’s-inspired bakes” are? Do the U.K. or Ireland have specific New Year’s desserts that we don’t know about? Terry’s Chocolate Orange … that’s a thing, right? Regardless, they’d better have the cast do Mary Berry’s <a href="http://thetalentzone.co.uk/musictv/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/littlenums.png">nun-inspired choux <i>religieuses</i></a><i>. </i>If that’s not the exact center of this particular Venn diagram, we don’t know what is!</p>
