      <h1>Foster wants win over Norwich to spark change in Watford’s fortunes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:18:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster is convinced victory over Norwich at Carrow Road on Friday night can help spark an overdue change in the Hornets’ fortunes.</p>
      <p>Foster’s side head to East Anglia still searching for their first win of the season and the 36-year-old has admitted the need to pick up three points gets bigger as each week goes by.</p>
      <p>Foster told his club’s official website: “I think at the moment it’s a matter of confidence – if we can get that first win under our belt, we can go on and really build on it.</p>
      <p>“If we can get a win and a couple of decisions go in our favour, it can really turn our season around.”</p>
      <p>Foster is convinced his side’s fortunes have shown signs of improvement since Quique Sanchez Flores returned to the club last month.</p>
      <p>A draw at Tottenham and a creditable performance in a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea last time out seem to back up Foster’s belief that Watford are on the cusp of climbing up the table.</p>
      <p>He added: “His (Flores’s) man-management is brilliant. He’s very big on the positive state of mind and the mental side of things.</p>
      <p>“We know these games are huge for us, absolutely huge. It’s a tough game but every game is tough – just ask Man City. There’s no God-given right that you’re going to get the three points.”</p>
      <p>Watford have received a huge boost with the news that Troy Deeney has returned to the squad and could feature at Carrow Road.</p>
      <p>Deeney has made a faster-than-anticipated recovery from a knee operation but having joined full training for the first time on Tuesday, questions remain about his match-fitness.</p>
      <p>Flores said: “If I say we miss him a lot, it sounds like an excuse.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want excuses right now. We want to play, improve on everything and we want Deeney in this team as we know what he means for this club.”</p>
