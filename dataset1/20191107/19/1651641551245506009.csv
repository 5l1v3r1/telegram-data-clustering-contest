07 Nov 2019, 19:33 by Pradeep





SwiftKey Keyboard app for iOS just got updated in App Store. This version 2.7.0 update comes with two new improvements. First, SwiftKey now supports voice typing. Yes, when you prefer to speak instead of type, you can use this new voice typing feature in SwiftKey. This feature works only for English language users for now. If you have English as your language, after installing this update, you can just tap the new microphone icon to begin the voice typing experience. In order to enter punctuations explicitly, try saying “new line.” This new update also adds “trending” GIFs section in the GIF panel.

Intelligent Keyboard:

SwiftKey learns from you, including your word choice, emoji usage and more
Swipe typing or tap-to-type, whichever you prefer
Toolbar: the expandable menu filled with quick shortcuts

GIF and Emoji Keyboard:

Express yourself with GIFs and emoji
Send pictures as a sticker to your friends and family
Find the emoji you like to use from our smiley library
