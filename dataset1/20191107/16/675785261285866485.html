      <h1>Bayern Munich 'say no' to Arsene Wenger after ex-Arsenal boss called to declare interest</h1>
      <h2>Former Arsenal manager Wenger reportedly phoned Bayern chief Karl-Heinz Rumenigge to signal his interest in the vacancy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:23:37+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Bayern Munich have reportedly rejected the chance to appoint former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Arsene Wenger as their next boss.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old called Bayern chief Karl-Heinz Rumenigge to declare his interest in the vacancy, according to German publication Bild.</p>
      <p>But Rumenigge decided against appointing Wenger to replace Niko Kovac who was axed after Bayern's 5-1 humbling by Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Wenger has been out of the dugout since leaving Arsenal at the end of the 2017-18 season after 22 years in north London.</p>
      <p>He is keen to get back into management at the top level but has rejected several offers since walking out of the Emirates.</p>

      <p>Hansi Flick is currently in caretaker charge of the Bavarians and led them to a 2-0 win over Olympiacos in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>But bigger challenges lie ahead, starting this Saturday as Bayern host Dortmund in Der Klassiker at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>Bayern chiefs could now look towards Thomas Tuchel at PSG or Ajax's Erik ten Hag as a replacement for Kovac.</p>
      <p>Max Allegri and Jose Mourinho have also been linked with the vacancy and Bayern will want to act quick having already fallen four points off the Bundesliga title place.</p>
