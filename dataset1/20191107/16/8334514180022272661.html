      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on a leader of an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militant group in Mali and warned the influence of Islamic State in West Africa was on the rise even as it lost territory elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted Amadou Koufa, a Salafist preacher and a leader of Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al Qaeda affiliate in the Sahel region.</p>
      <p>French officials last year had said the militant leader had died in a raid in the former French colony, but he appeared in a propaganda video in February.</p>
      <p>U.S. sanctions block any assets Koufa may have under U.S. control and bar any persons or entities in the United States from any dealings or transactions with him.</p>
      <p>Northern and central Mali saw an increase in “widespread terrorist activity” in 2018, according to the U.S. State Department’s annual global terrorism report.</p>
      <p>“ISIS is an increasing threat in places like Afghanistan, in places like West Africa, Southeast Asia - there’s an active ISIS presence there as well,” a senior State Department official said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Islamic State, which declared itself a so-called “caliphate” in 2014, lost control in 2017 of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and quickly thereafter almost all of its territory as a result of operations by U.S.-backed forces. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed last month in Syria in a raid by U.S. special forces.</p>
      <p>U.S. officials in July added two other leaders of an al Qaeda affiliate in Mali to its global terrorism list.</p>
