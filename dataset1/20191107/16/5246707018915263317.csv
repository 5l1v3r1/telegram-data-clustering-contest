If you missed the news last week, SteamWorld Quest is going on sale in physical form today. The Switch console exclusive is a particularly solid and satisfying card battler well worth your time, but there's another reason you might want to pick up a copy, too.
Super Rare Games has confirmed that, should SteamWorld Quest sell well, it has been given the go-ahead to also release both SteamWorld Heist and SteamWorld Dig: A Fistful of Dirt in lovely physical form. If you're hoping to have a full set of SteamWorld games on your shelf, this sounds like a pretty good opportunity.
SteamWorld Quest will be going live on the site at 6pm UK time today (so that's 10am PT / 1pm ET / 7pm CET) and will be available for £30. It comes with all of the usual Super Rare extras which you can see below and is limited to 7,000 copies.
