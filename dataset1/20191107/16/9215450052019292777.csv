食環署：農曆年宵不設乾貨攤位
署方說，為保障公眾安全及公共秩序，以及更有效實施人群管理措施，食環署決定擴大年宵市場攤檔的面積，以配合銷售年花的運作需要，同時亦會擴闊公共通道，以紓緩擠逼情況。在整體攤檔數目減少的情況下，只能提供濕貨攤位集中銷售年花；若場地情況許可亦會提供快餐攤位。
食環署表示，年宵市場明年1月19日至1月25日，一連7天在15個地點舉行，共設有近1,300個濕貨攤位及18個快餐攤位供市民競投，將於下周二開始公開競投，而由於面對經濟下行壓力，為支援中小企業，年宵市場攤位競投底價是去年競投底價的一半。
205個文化節目遭取消或延期
香港貴為國際大都會，每年都有不同類型的大小型國際及本地盛事在這彈丸之地舉行，但根據康文署統計，原來在反修例風波發生後，已有205個於康文署轄下場地舉辦的文化節目遭取消或延期，部分節目則須由周末夜晚改為日間或平日上演，避免受示威活動影響。
貿發局亦表示，在7月至11月期間舉行的9個大型展覽，有約300家參展商取消來港參與展覽。回顧近月，不少年度盛事都因受示威活動影響而被逼取消，包括10月1日的國慶煙花匯演、10月27日的新世界維港泳2019、10月31日的海洋公園哈囉喂全日祭及10月31至11月3日的香港美酒佳餚巡禮。而由於反修例風波持續升溫，一些原訂於年尾舉辦的大型活動亦宣告取消、延期或提早結束。


港人最關心的農曆新年年宵市場，食環署至今未公佈任何詳情，有傳食環署計劃取消所有年宵市場的乾貨檔。

包括於12月舉行的工展會，展期會由原訂的24天縮短至22天，而開放時間亦會提早於晚上8時關閉；時尚品牌 Chanel 原訂11月來港舉行「2019/20早春度假系列」時裝展，亦延期至「以後更合適的時間」舉行。至於港人最關心的農曆新年年宵市場，食環署至今未公佈任何詳情，有傳食環署計劃取消所有年宵市場的乾貨檔。

不過亦有部分活動舉辦人強調儘管面對香港目前的情況，仍會盡力按原訂計劃舉辦活動。年度音樂界盛事Clockenflap創辦人之一Mike Hill表示「以現時的局勢，加上許多其他活動都選擇取消，我們認為讓大家擁有一個值得期待，好玩而又具啟發性的本地活動尤為重要。」但他亦強調，參加者的安全永遠是Clockenflap的首要關注之一。
