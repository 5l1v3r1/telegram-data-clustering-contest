BOSTON (AP) - A Rhode Island man will serve 70 months in prison for his role in a fentanyl conspiracy.
Twenty-eight-year-old Dario Bier Romero of Providence was sentenced in federal court in Boston on Wednesday. After completing his prison sentence, he must also serve four years of supervised release.
Federal investigators on June 21, 2018 seized approximately three kilograms of fentanyl from Romero and a co-defendant during a probe. An additional kilogram of fentanyl and drug packaging paraphernalia was later seized at Romero's home.
Romero pleaded guilty in July to several drug-related charges, including conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than 400 grams of fentanyl.
