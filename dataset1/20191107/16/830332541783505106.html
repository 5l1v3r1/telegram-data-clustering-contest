      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The state Assembly is preparing to pass a bill that would require developers to purchase wetland mitigation credits within the watershed they're changing.</p>
      <p>The Department of Natural Resources requires creation or preservation of other wetlands as a condition of an individual permit allowing dredging or filling wetlands. Builders can satisfy those conditions by purchasing credits from a mitigation bank located anywhere in Wisconsin. Banks are a stash of credits generated by other developers who created or preserved wetlands.</p>
      <p>The bill would require builders buy credits from banks in impacted watersheds. The DNR could allow purchases from other watersheds to better serve conservation goals, however.</p>
      <p>The Assembly is set to vote on the bill Thursday. The Senate passed it last month. Assembly approval would send the bill to Gov. Tony Evers.</p>
