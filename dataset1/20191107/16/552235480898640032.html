      <p>A top DJ is to spin the decks for 24 hours as part of a marathon fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Dean Burnett will tackle the unique challenge by pumping out the tunes at Ayr’s Arthur Street Kitchen.</p>
      <p>The care worker is resident disc spinner at the popular nightspot.</p>
      <p>And he’s planning to stand in the booth for a full day without a break as part of his wacky gig.</p>
      <p>Dean, a care assistant at Carrick House, said: “I came up with an idea of raising money for the residents’ fund.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to do something that was a bit different so I got my thinking cap on.</p>
      <p>“I saw that Armin Van Buuren once did a 14 hour DJ set and it gave me the idea for this.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to be easy – I imagine it will be pretty lonely at points but I’ll push through!”</p>
      <p>Dean will kick off his set at noon on Saturday, November 24 with an easy listening set for diners.</p>
      <p>His night time tunes will then kick in for a packed dance floor.</p>
      <p>But when clubbers head home for their kip, Dean will be left playing to an empty venue – with just the cleaner for company.</p>
      <p>He laughed: “It will be just me and her, so it’s going to be a strange atmosphere.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to stream the set live on Facebook, though, so people can check up on my progress.”</p>
      <p>Dean, 27, added: “It’s all for a great cause and I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>ASK general manager, Jon Neil, said: “We’re delighted to help Dean in any way we can for this great cause and it promises to be a fantastic challenge.”</p>
