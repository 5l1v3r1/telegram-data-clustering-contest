      <h1>Cambuslang mum fraudulently claimed more than £42,000 in housing benefits</h1>
      <h2>Jennifer Aitken broke the law by not telling the council on her application that she had two children with her landlord.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:13:15+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rutherglen Reformer, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rutherglen-reformer/</a></address>
      <p>A Cambuslang mum who fraudulently claimed more than £42,000 in housing benefits was snared after admitting an affair with her landlord.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Aitken, 39, falsely claimed from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">South Lanarkshire Council</a> between October 2012 and April 2018.</p>
      <p>Aitken told the DWP that she originally needed support but it had “snowballed.”</p>
      <p>She broke the law by not telling the council on her application that she had two children with her landlord.</p>
      <p>So far, Aitken has only repaid £300 of the money she claimed.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty today at Glasgow Sheriff Court to embezzling housing benefit of £42,874.85.</p>
      <p>The court heard Aitken lied on her form when it came to a question about her relationship with her landlord.</p>
      <p>She denied having a relationship or children with the landlord.</p>
      <p>The DWP received a “tip-off” that the accused was living with her partner and they investigated.</p>
      <p>Aitken was interviewed at a job centre in Rutherglen where she denied knowledge of the fraud.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lauren McRobert said: “Aitken later admitted to having an affair with her landlord and that he was the father of her sons.</p>
      <p>“She said she needed support and then it snowballed.</p>
      <p>“She said he did not live there at the time and had another family and he was split between them.”</p>
      <p>Aitken was informed that she shouldn’t have claimed housing benefit based on her background.</p>
      <p>She was re-assessed by the DWP and lost her housing benefits due to the relationship with the landlord.</p>
      <p>A payment plan was made in October 2018 for £100 a month.</p>
      <p>Aitken has only paid £300 since but emailed the DWP to start again in January next year.</p>
      <p>Sentence was deferred for reports until next month by Sheriff Andrew Cubie.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Cubie told her: “Be under no illusions that the extent is you took £42,000 of the public tax purse and custody is an option.”</p>
      <p>Aitken, still living in the same flat in Cambuslang, was bailed meantime.</p>
