      <p>Republicans will now officially request a public testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-11-07-2019/h_07cafebd64c868b45e4333c6e49d2baf">CNN</a> Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) told reporters that Republicans will request that the House Intelligence Committee force the whistleblower to testify publicly.</p>
      <p>It remains unlikely the whistleblower would ever actually appear in a public forum.</p>
      <p>CNN reported that Jordan mentioned that Republicans have until Saturday to request witnesses, and they’ll include the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>A Jordan aide told CNN that although Republicans would accept a public or private testimony from the whistleblower, their request will be filed under House rules for the public phase of the impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the whistleblower’s lawyers Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid said in a statement that they <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/whistleblower-lawyers-identity-trump-supporters">refuse to confirm or deny</a> any alleged names floated by Trump allies and conservative media. Last weekend, Zaid said that his client has <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/whistleblower-has-offered-to-answer-republicans-questions-says-lawyer">offered to answer Republicans’ questions</a> under oath.</p>
      <p>President Trump and his GOP allies have ramped up their calls for the whistleblower to publicly testify in the past week. On Sunday, Trump <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-whistleblower-reporters-identity">prodded White House reporters</a> to investigate and release the person’s identity. <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/rand-paul-whistleblower-name-media-print">Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)</a> backed Trump’s whistleblower crusade the next day during a campaign rally in Kentucky Monday evening. <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/don-jr-promotes-attempt-to-identify-whistleblower">Donald Trump Jr.</a> joined the GOP chorus Wednesday by promoting an attempt to name the government official.</p>
      <p>However, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) — who is set to <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/graham-senate-judiciary-chairmanship-grassley">return as the Senate Judiciary chair</a> in the next Congress — <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-whistleblower-reporters-identity">doubled down</a> on his stance Monday that whistleblowers should be protected.</p>
      <p>Major news organizations — which include CNN, NBC News and even the Trump-friendly Fox News — have <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/fox-cnn-nbc-policy-whistleblower-identity">issued guidance</a> to their staffers to refrain from identifying the whistleblower.</p>
