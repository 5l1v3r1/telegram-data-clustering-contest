EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey -- There is new information about that black cat that stole the show at Monday night's Cowboys-Giants game.
MetLife stadium says it brought in a rescue group, PuppyKittyNYCity, to help with the search for the feline.
So far, humane traps have been placed throughout the stadium.
Officials said on Twitter that despite reports there that the stadium houses and feeds some 300 cats, those claims are ""simply not true.""
However, the Meadowlands Racetrack has a trap, neuter, and release program in place and currently has 30 barn cats.



The famed black cat was seen dashing on the field forcing a delay of game.



The cat scampered on the field during a Giants drive in the second quarter and forced referee Clay Martin to delay the game while workers at MetLife Stadium and some New Jersey State Troopers herded the feline toward the end zone away from the players.
It was eventually directed into the corner of the end zone and into the tunnel but has not been found since.
