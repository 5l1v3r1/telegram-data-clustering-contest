India beat Bangladesh after several blunders, Rohit Sharma misses out on century in 100th T20I appearance
07 Nov 2019, 16:50 by JKR Staff
India on Thursday defeated Bangladesh by eight wickets in a match that saw several embarrassing blunders by the Indian side in the field. Rohit Sharma played the captain’s knock in his 100th T20 International appearance and made 85 in just 41 balls. He was unlucky to have not completed his century. His half-century came in just 23 balls as he looked determined to punish the Bangladeshi bowlers. Rohit’s innings included six sixes and six boundaries.



Shikhar Dhawan provided nice support to his skipper before he got out for 31. But, by then India had almost secured their victory.
Batting first at Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot, Bangladesh made a flying start as their opening batsmen scored 60 runs in just 7.1 overs. However, their innings weren’t devoid of drama as Indian fielders including skipper Rohit Sharma disappointed fans with their sloppy approach. The most embarrassing moment came when the third umpire declared Rishabh Pant’s stumping of Litton Das ‘not out.’





Although Rishabh had stumped Litton by a huge margin, the third umpire concluded that the Indian wicket-keeper had caught the ball even before it crossed the stumps. Das went on to score 29 runs in just 21 balls. If this was not enough, Rohit was seen dropping what appeared to be a regulation catch. The batsman in question was once again Litton.
However, the Indians redeemed themselves later in the game and restricted the Tigers to just  153-6 in 20 overs. Soumya Sarkar and captain Mahmudullah made 30 each, while  Mohammad Naim played a fine knock of 36 in 31 balls.
For India, Deepak Chahar, Khaleel Ahmed and Washington Sundar took one each while  Yuzvendra Chahal picked up two wickets.
India achieved the target for the loss of just two wickets with 4.2 overs to spare.
Bangladesh had beaten India in the first T20 International encounter, played in Delhi. The final encounter of the three-match series will take place on 10 November.
