        <b>City traders have urged UK and European exchanges to cut trading hours to improve work-life balance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They say the long hours are bad for mental health and are not exactly family-friendly.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to find childcare at five o'clock in the morning," said April Day, head of equities at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).</p>
      <p>The idea is for exchanges to open 09:00 to 16:00, instead of 08:00 to 16:30.</p>
      <p>The AFME is pushing for the change alongside fellow trader body the Investment Association.</p>
      <p>Shorter trading hours on equity markets would cut pressure on traders and attract a more diverse range of workers, it said.</p>

      <p>Stock market trading has traditionally been seen as male-dominated, lagging behind other areas of financial services in terms of attracting women into roles,</p>
      <p>The AFME's Ms Day said her organisation had been lobbying stock exchanges in London, Paris, Germany and the Nordic region.</p>
      <p>"A shorter working day would improve flexibility for employees and attract a more diverse range of individuals on to trading floors," she added.</p>
      <p>The London Stock Exchange said it would launch a consultation on the request.</p>

      <p>Traders in the UK and elsewhere in Europe normally work for a few hours either side of the current 8.5 trading hours, Ms Day said.</p>
      <p>By contrast, US exchanges are open for 6.5 hours and Asian exchanges for 6.</p>
      <p>A knock-on effect of having a smaller intake of women in junior positions means that there are relatively few women in senior management positions in investment and banking trading, Ms Day said.</p>
      <p>Juggling work and childcare responsibilities can be a challenge for both men and women, she added.</p>

      <h3>'It is a long day, it is a stressful job'</h3>
      <p>Nikki Martin has worked in the City for almost 20 years as a money manager and trader. After having a daughter she said she needed to hire a nanny so she could leave the house at 05:30 to arrive at work on time.</p>
      <p>Fitting in work and client meetings sometimes means late nights.</p>
      <p>"When I have client dinners that I need to attend it pretty much kills me as getting to bed at, say, eleven with a four-thirty alarm is not pleasant, not to mention the fact that I don't see my child as much as I would like to," she says.</p>
      <p>"It is a long day, it is a stressful job and doing this five days a week leads to burn out," she says.</p>
      <p>Nowadays she works one or two days a week from home. But she says she knows so many women that have left the industry or have moved sideways because "bringing up a child is just not compatible with the job".</p>
      <p>"Shorter trading hours in my mind would undoubtedly go some way towards rectifying this issue."</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Long hours in a high-pressure job can also exacerbate any mental health difficulties traders may be suffering, Ms Day added.</p>
      <p>Galina Dimitrova, director of capital markets at the Investment Association, concurred: "We have heard many deeply moving stories of traders' mental health and personal life being impacted by their working hours.</p>
      <p>"Whilst it is no silver bullet, we hope this European-wide review could start to lead to a step change in more efficient markets to the benefit of savers and those who operate them."</p>
      <p>The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture in the City.</p>
      <p>It said the call from the trader associations was "an important suggestion for a European-wide adjustment to trading hours".</p>
      <p>"We intend to consider the request in a formal consultation with London Stock Exchange's global members and customers," it added.</p>
