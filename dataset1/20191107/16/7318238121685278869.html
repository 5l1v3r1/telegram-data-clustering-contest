      <p>Self-taught violin maker Svetozar Bogdanoski, from North Macedonia, made his first instrument for his son, Kostadin.</p>
      <p>At the age of seven, Kostadin showed promise as a violinist but the family could not afford to buy the boy a violin. So trained painter Svetozar took matters into his own hands and crafted him one himself.</p>
      <p>More than three decades later, Svetozar is an internationally renowned, award-winning violin maker, and Kostadin a professional musician.</p>
      <p>Svetozar has twice been recognised by the prestigious Violin Society of America in their annual awards, with a Certificate of Merit for Tone. He hand crafts his masterpieces alongside his wife Marija, herself a violinist, and their colleague Tatjana Miseva, a fellow painter.</p>
      <p>The trio source maple and spruce from Bosnian forests for their instruments, some of which are copies of instruments by famed violin makers such as Stradivarius or Guarneri.</p>
      <p>Although Svetozar and his wife have made more than 700 instruments over the years, some costing tens of thousands of euros, he says no two instruments are exactly alike.</p>
      <p>"Each violin has something specific and unique," he said. "They differ from each other just as people do."</p>
