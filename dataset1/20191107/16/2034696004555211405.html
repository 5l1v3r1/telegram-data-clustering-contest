      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/christine-and-the-queens">Christine and the Queens</a> got treated to a drag makeover by an alumnus of <i>RuPaul’s Drag Race.</i></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/christine-queens-girlfriend-track-review-2316777">‘Girlfriend’</a> singer, who is renowned for playing with gender, had her face painted by drag star Milk who also dressed her up in some eye-catching attire for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGf0dpvU0SM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"><i>them’s</i></a> video.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the clip Milk says she wouldn’t give Chris (real name Héloïse Letissier) a standard makeover because they are both unique individuals. “It’s not necessarily ‘femme glam,’ I think it’s more fun, punk, play-with-colours, play-with-lines,” Milk says while Letissier awaits her transformation.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Elsewhere in the video Letissier recalls a time when a group of drag queens performing in London helped pull her out of a depressive episode. “I watched them own everything and be fabulous, and I was like, ‘I want that to happen for me, too. I want that feeling of being free, and empowered, and wild’,” she said, also reflecting on how it motivated her to kickstart her career.</p>
      <p>The end result of the session sees Chris wearing an abstract, geometric-styled face of makeup, a full silver outfit and an orange wig. A pretty trippy, out-there transformation for a pretty out-of-this world pop star.</p>
