While family, friends and fans hailed the “Shahenshah” (King) of Bollywood on hitting the golden anniversary milestone, the 77-year-old actor revealed that doctors have asked him to take rest for a while.
In his latest blog-post, Amitabh noted that his doctors who he referred to as the “stethoscope dressed messengers from heaven” have given “strong warnings to cut back on work"" as the actor still juggles multiple film and television projects. 
Earlier in October, hell broke loose when Amitabh was admitted to hospital for three days in western Mumbai. Speculations made the rounds then suggesting that the veteran actor was getting treated for some liver ailment.
However, lightning up the mood, Amitabh’s son – actor Abhishek Bachchan took to Twitter and expressed pride and delight on his father’s big day.






​Other members of the Indian film fraternity including actors, directors and film critics like Saif Ali Khan, Karan Johar,  Ekta Kapoor, Anupama Chopra and Girish Johar also congratulated the National Award-winning actor on completing 50 years in the film industry.















​Fans also flooded the social media platforms in India with huge numbers of #50YearsOfBachchan posts.












​With around 195 movies, the ""living legend” is often credited with having redefined stardom in the Hindi movie industry.
The actor has received some of the highest civilian honours and movie awards in India, including the Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri and was conferred the highest award in cinema, Dada Saheb Phalke Award.
Amitabh has also bagged the International Indian Film Academy Award, Filmfare and Guild Awards in the Best Actor category over the long span of his career. 
 The actor currently is charming Indian television as the host of a quiz-show, while also shooting for his upcoming film, ""Gulabo Sitabo"" with actor Ayushmann Khurrana.
