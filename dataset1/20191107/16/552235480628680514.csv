Ayr United starlet Luke McCowan is being linked with a move to English Championship side Cardiff City.
The Bluebirds are understood to be monitoring the striker, following a string of stunning displays.
McCowan, who has hit eight goals for Ayr this season, is attracting the eye of a number of big club scouts down south.
And Cardiff are thought to be at the head of the queue, with boss Neil Warnock considering a January bid.

Tom Coleman, sports reporter at WalesOnline, told the Ayrshire Post: ""The move would make a lot of sense from Cardiff's end.
""They don't have a lot of money to spend these days and McCowan would fit the profile of a young player with a lot of potential.
""He's a name that's being linked and it will be of interest with January coming up.
""He would certainly tick a lot of boxes for Warnock.
The speculation comes a year on from fellow Welsh giants Swansea City, circling around Lawrence Shankland during his time at Ayr.
But chairman Lachlan Cameron told the Dragons he was not prepared to sell his star striker - even for a bid of £250,000.
