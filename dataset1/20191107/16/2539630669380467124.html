        <b>The second batch of <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/10/pinebook-pro-preorder-ansi-iso-keyboards">Pinebook Pro pre-orders went live</a> this week, just as buyers of the first wave begun to receive their devices!</b>
      </p>
      <p>And, naturally, as you‚Äôd expect, in true millennial tech ownership style, a swathe of Pinebook Pro unboxing videos started to sprout out of the web‚Äôs fertile mantle.</p>
      <p>Including the following comprehensive run-through by YouTuber <i>jpakkane1</i> (a link to which landed in the omg! tip box yesterday, so thanks Sadat!).</p>
      <p>This 10 minute clip has everything you could possibly want to see: a literal unboxing; first boot experience; side-by-side comparison with (unfair klaxon sound) a 13.1‚Ä≥ MacBook (!); and connection to an external display.</p>
      <p>AND should you make it all the way to the end there‚Äôs even some disassembly pr0n (if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing ofc üòâ).</p>

      <p>YouTube isn‚Äôt the only outlet Pinebook Pro owners are using to share their first impressions. There‚Äôs a dedicated <a href="https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=8024">thread on the Pine64 forums</a>; Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pinebookpro">awash with feedback</a> (and the <a href="https://twitter.com/ruari/status/1191444935603638273">odd raised eyebrow</a>); and owners are sharing photos over on Facebook (it still exists, I checked).</p>
      <aside>Buyers seem majorly impressed by the build quality of the Pinebook Pro and its magnesium alloy body</aside>
      <p>Overall, people seem majorly impressed by the magnesium alloy casing and<b> build quality given the low price point</b> of the Pinebook Pro (it‚Äôs a mere $199 after all).</p>
      <p>Things are a little less rounded software wise, but I‚Äôd expect as much given that desktop Linux on ARM hardware (regardless of OS) remains very much a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù ‚Äî but hey: software CAN be improved.</p>
      <p>The Pinebook Pro sounds like it‚Äôs an eminently usable (i.e. fast <i>enough</i>) Linux laptop that, in many instances, could replace a Chromebook (there‚Äôs even a build of ChromiumOS for it) or iPad for couch-based web surfing.</p>
      <p>If you‚Äôve been mulling a purchase, perhaps some of this collective feedback will help you make up your mind!</p>
