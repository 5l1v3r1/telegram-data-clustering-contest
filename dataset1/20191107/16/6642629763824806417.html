      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>'s influence and strategic capabilities in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html">Middle East</a> are increasing despite the reimposition of crippling <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> sanctions and a faltering nuclear deal with world powers, a new report has said.</p>
      <p>The Islamic Republic's ability to "fight by, with and through third parties" in countries such as Syria, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/lebanon.html">Lebanon</a>, Iraq, and<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html"> Yemen</a> has contributed to Iran's regional impact, a study by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) found.</p>
      <p>This has brought Iran more regional influence and status than its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, according to the 217-page report titled Iran's Networks of Influence in the Middle East.</p>

      <p>Iran has expanded its ideology and influence since 1979, which has granted it strategic depth in the region - more so than its traditional rivals, including the United States.</p>
      <p>The report said no state has been as effective as Iran in regional conflicts during the past decade, especially with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force.</p>
      <p>"Iran's lack of state allies, a plethora of well-resourced regional and international adversaries, and antiquated and sanctions-constrained armed forces compelled Tehran to develop a military doctrine that avoided direct or extended conflict with superior conventional powers," it said.</p>
      <p>The advantages came despite domestic unrest.</p>
      <p>Last year, Iran witnessed a wave of protests and discontent as its economy continues to suffer from years of economic sanctions.</p>
      <p>Social and economic inequality pushed tens of thousands of Iranians across the country to rally over the rising cost of living, and against the policies of a religious-political system that has ruled Iran for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>Iranians blamed the government for being involved in conflicts beyond the nation's borders, but this has not forced the ruling elite to change regional policies.</p>
      <p>For many Iranians, the 2015 nuclear deal signed with world powers was meant to bring economic relief through the relaxation of punishing sanctions.</p>
      <p>But today, Iran has distanced itself from the historic deal more than ever before. It has taken significant steps in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/warns-iran-preparing-nuclear-breakout-191107144101560.html">reducing its commitments to the deal</a> by injecting uranium gas into more than<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/iran-breaks-crumbling-nuclear-deal-191104110945872.html"> 1,000 centrifuges</a> at its underground Fordow plant.</p>
      <p>The nuclear accord - signed in 2015 by Iran, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>, the US, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/france.html">France</a>, Germany, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a> - bans nuclear activity at Fordow, a plant located near the northern city of Qom, and capped the level of purity uranium can be enriched at 3.67 percent - suitable for civilian power generation and far below the 90 percent threshold of nuclear-weapons grade.</p>
      <p>Before the deal, Iran used Fordow to enrich uranium to 20 percent fissile purity. Officials have said Tehran could again reach that level but they will hold off for now.</p>
      <p>With the injection of uranium gas into its centrifuges, Fordow will move from its permitted status as a research plant to an active nuclear site.</p>
