      <p>London - Former <b>England</b> captain <b>Dylan Hartley</b> announced his retirement from rugby on Thursday after failing to recover from a long-standing knee injury.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, England's second-most capped player with 97 Test appearances, skippered his country to the 2016 Six Nations Grand Slam.</p>
      <p>Hartley, who had a poor disciplinary record, was a surprise choice for many when England coach Eddie Jones appointed him captain after the disastrous first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Jones paid a handsome tribute to the New Zealand-born Northampton star, who also led England to the 2017 Six Nations title and who captained his country on 30 occasions.</p>
      <p>"Dylan has had a significant international career playing for his country, having played 97 Tests, and was a tough, enduring character for us," said Jones.</p>
      <p>"He was a foundation captain and we owe him a lot for his contribution to the making of this team.</p>
      <p>"We will be forever indebted to him for his dedication and commitment to the team and his love of English rugby."</p>
      <p>Hartley, who made 251 appearances for Northampton and captained them to the Premiership title in 2014, admitted it had been a tough year battling with the knee injury.</p>
      <p>"The last few months have been difficult for me both mentally and physically as I've come to terms with the fact that I am no longer able to compete," said Hartley, who has not played since December.</p>
      <p>"My career wasn't perfect, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.</p>
      <p>"I'm privileged to have experienced some amazing highs while there have also been some personal lows, all of which are powerful experiences that will stay with me forever.</p>
      <p>"The final chapter of my career was supposed to go a different way, but that is the nature of professional sport."</p>
