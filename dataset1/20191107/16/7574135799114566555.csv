The following new tours were announced. Check the Tour Dates category every day for more.

BRYCE DESSNER (of THE NATIONAL)

Bryce Dessner has been having a pretty busy year. Not only do The National have a new album out, but Bryce released a classical album, he contributed to the posthumous Leonard Cohen album and the Bon Iver album, and he has some live events coming up this month. One is in Rome, and the other is at NYC’s David Geffen Hall from November 14-16, where Bryce will play guitar with the New York Philharmonic for the New York premiere of his piece, Wires. Tickets and more info here.

DEATH THREAT

New Haven hardcore vets Death Threat are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their 1998 debut Last Dayz at a home state show at Hamden’s Space Ballroom on Friday (11/8) with Billy Club Sandwich, World Demise, Carried By Six, and Nightmare Solution; and they’ll also come to NYC for a one-off around the holidays on December 28 at The Kingsland with Mindforce, Restraining Order, The Answer, and one more TBA.




THE HOTELIER

The Hotelier have been fairly quiet lately, but they have a few shows coming up. They’re playing Brandeis this Friday (11/8) (and they say “You can’t really go, but you could if you were dedicated”), and then Christian Holden is doing a solo Hotelier set opening for Weatherbox in Brooklyn on 11/21 (tickets), and then on December 3 they’re playing Fitchburg State Uni (“Again, you can’t go to that, unless…”). More info here.

TALIB KWELI / SLICK RICK

Talib Kweli begins his full-band run at the Blue Note Jazz Club tonight (11/7) and it continues with two shows a night through Sunday (11/10). Special guests are promised at each set, and he revealed that the 8 PM show on Friday will feature the legendary Slick Rick. Slick Rick also plays his annual birthday show at NYC’s Brooklyn Bowl in January, Atlantic City after that, and a Chicago show in February (dates here). Talib also has other dates, including some with his Black Star partner Yasiin Bey (fka Mos Def). And at the Friday night of the Blue Note run, you can stick around after Talib for even more veteran Brooklyn rap from Masta Ace and his collaborator Marco Polo doing a 12:30 AM set.

THIS WILL DESTROY YOU / CHRISTOPHER TIGNOR

Post-rockers This Will Destroy You are beginning their tour with modern classical composer Christopher Tignor this week, and just ahead of the tour, Botany offered up a new remix of a Christopher Tignor song. All dates and a stream of that remix here.
