Amber Alert issued for missing Florida 5-year-old

The mother of a missing 5-year-old Florida girl is no longer cooperating with investigators' search efforts, authorities said Thursday.
Taylor Rose Williams was allegedly last seen in her home in Jacksonville's Brentwood neighborhood when her mother put her to bed around midnight on Wednesday. When the mother woke up around 7 a.m., she said she noticed the back door to the home was unlocked and Taylor wasn't in her room, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.
The mother called 911 and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement issued an Amber Alert for the little girl later that morning, authorities said.


The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office released this photo of Taylor Rose Williams who was reported missing on Nov. 6, 2019.

Taylor's mother, Brianna Williams, initially cooperated with police, but she isn't anymore, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference on Thursday.
Brianna Williams was the last person to see the little girl, the sheriff said. It is not clear when someone besides Brianna Williams saw the 5-year-old, the sheriff said.
The mother has not been arrested, the sheriff added.
Anyone who has seen Taylor and her mother in Jacksonville in the last six months is asked to reach out to the sheriff's office, he said.

Various local, state and federal agencies are assisting in the search for Taylor. Officers have scoured the surrounding area, going door-to-door to hundreds of neighboring homes, checking vehicles and even looking through dumpsters in hopes of finding the little girl.
Authorities were also checking any nearby bodies of water, as ""children are unfortunately drawn toward water,"" Waters told reporters Wednesday afternoon.
