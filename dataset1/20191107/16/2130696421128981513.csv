This will allow the buyer to explore many possible uses such as a food court, restaurant, cafe, fast-food chain, healthcare and education institutions –subject to approval from relevant authorities.
""The indicative psf price of S$3,259 is also attractive, when compared to the last ground-floor unit transaction at Alexis that changed hands at S$4,452 psf four years ago,"" Mr Tay said.
