      <p>PUTRAJAYA (Nov 7): Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today he will only expel any member of his administration if something very serious has happened.</p>
      <p>Referring to Opposition calls for the expulsion of Attorney-General Tan Sri Tommy Thomas, he said he does not sack anyone just because somebody demands it.</p>
      <p>"I am not in the business of sacking people. Sometimes people make mistakes," he told a press conference after chairing a meeting of the national committee on government election pledges here.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir was asked about the Opposition calls for him to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to sack Thomas over alleged interference in the prosecution process, including in an LTTE-related case.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister, in jest, said he would like to get rid of some of the Opposition leaders.</p>
      <p>"I would like to pecat (sack) some of the Opposition members because they make a lot of mistakes. But, we have the rule of law, we obey the rule of law," he said.</p>
