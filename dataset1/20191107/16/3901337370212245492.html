      <p>“We don’t have any beef. It happens in big games where emotions run high and things are done in the heat of the moment. I know this because I also do some crazy stuff at times.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he thought Lorch’s actions were deliberate, the 29-year-old revealed that the duo spoke about the incident. </p>
      <p>“We are cool, we spoke about it after the game. I don’t think his actions were deliberate. Orlando Pirates are a big team with quality players, I don’t think they will target me.”</p>
      <p>Billiat &amp; Co will be hoping to get one over their arch-rivals as the two sides lock horns for the second time in seven days.  </p>
