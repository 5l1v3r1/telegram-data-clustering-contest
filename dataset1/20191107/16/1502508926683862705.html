      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gujarat">Gujarat </a>government on Thursday issued a notification asking restaurants and hotels to remove "no entry" signs so that customers can enter their kitchens and inspect the level of hygiene.</p>
      <p>The notification was issued by H G Koshia, Commissioner, Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA).</p>
      <p>It directed concerned officials to visit restaurants and hotels in their respective areas and remove sign boards announcing "No entry" or "No admission without permission" from kitchen doors.</p>
      <p>The FDCA also asked restaurant and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hotel">hotel </a>owners to install transparent glass on kitchen doors so that customers can peek from outside.</p>
      <p>A fine of Rs 1 lakh will be imposed if the directives are not followed within two weeks.</p>
      <p>"Now <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hotel">hotel </a>or restaurant owners can not stop customers from visiting the kitchen to make sure that proper hygiene is being maintained. This is important from health point of view," said Koshia.</p>
