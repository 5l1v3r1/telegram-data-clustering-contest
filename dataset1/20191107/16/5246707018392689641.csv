Launching today on Nintendo Switch is The Manga Works, a simulation game where you'll be perfecting your career as an artist.
You'll start off your journey as a new and inexperienced manga artist armed only with your pen and your imagination. Your goal is to work across anime, drama and even movies, with part of the gameplay revolving around securing publishing deals and heading out in search of inspiration. Here's a quick description of what you'll be getting up to:
Ideas are the lifeblood of a manga artist. Go out in search of inspiration and gather plot points, then stuff your manga full of creativity. Accumulate experience points and use them to train up your drawing, storytelling, and other skills. When you think you've created a great one-shot, take it to a publisher! If you manage to make the ""editor from hell"" smile, it might just be the start of a fruitful relationship.
Produce the best manga the world has ever seen, and write your name down in history!












The game is available from the Nintendo Switch eShop today for $14 / £11.69 and can also be found on mobile stores.
