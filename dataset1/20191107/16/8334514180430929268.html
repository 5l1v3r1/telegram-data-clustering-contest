      <h1>Venue worry delays India's Davis Cup team selection v Pakistan</h1>

      <p>NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will wait until the venue of their deferred Davis Cup clash against rivals Pakistan is known before naming their squad for the Asia/Oceania Group I tie, newly-appointed captain Rohit Rajpal said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The International Tennis Federation (ITF) postponed the tie between the neighbors, originally scheduled in Islamabad in September, to Nov. 29-30 following a security review.</p>
      <p>ITF announced on Monday that the event will be played at a neutral venue, as demanded by the All India Tennis Federation (AITA) which cited security concerns.</p>
      <p>But with the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) opting to appeal against the ITF decision, the venue uncertainty has forced India to delay the team selection.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if they can convince ITF and get it back to Islamabad. I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Rajpal told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We could very well be going back to Pakistan. My role as the captain is now to make sure that all the players are together and we win the tie.”</p>
      <p>Pakistan expelled India’s ambassador and suspended bilateral trade with its neighbor in August after New Delhi removed “special status” from its portion of the contested region of Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Bilateral cricketing ties between the two nations have remained suspended since 2008. An Indian tennis team last traveled to Pakistan in 1964 for a Davis Cup tie, defeating the hosts 4-0, while Pakistan lost 3-2 on their last visit to India in 2006.</p>
      <p>The venue dispute has also led to bad blood between the AITA and its top players.</p>
      <p>Rajpal was appointed India captain on Monday replacing multiple doubles Grand Slam winner Mahesh Bhupathi who, along with several players, had declined to tour Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Bhupathi subsequently criticized the way he was removed hours before ITF announced a neutral venue and was backed on social media by players including Rohan Bopanna and Sumit Nagal.</p>
      <p>In case the tie is played at a neutral venue, the likes of Bopanna and Nagal would be considered despite their criticism of the federation, Rajpal said.</p>
      <p>“Assuming it’s a neutral venue, we’ll start the process again,” Rajpal said.</p>
      <p>“We’ll decide the squad based on whether it’s a neutral venue and on what surface.”</p>
      <p>Rajpal said the list of players ready to tour Pakistan, should the tie return to Islamabad, included 46-year-old Leander Paes.</p>
