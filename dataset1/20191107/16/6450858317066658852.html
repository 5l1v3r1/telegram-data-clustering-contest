      <h3>Budget phone buying advice</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of affordable smartphones out there and although swinging for the lowest price tag can be tempting, it doesn't make sense to skimp on a product you'll likely end up using almost every day for months or years at a time.</p>
      <p>Try and buy from an established brand that you know and trust, not only as bigger companies' products are usually held to higher quality standards, but should anything go wrong with your purchase, more established players also typically offer more robust customer support systems.</p>
      <p>Don't expect affordable phones such as these to feel like miniature flagships; such phones most obviously sacrifice hardware and/or camera performance to cut costs, while others opt for lesser build quality or less-premium materials - such as polycarbonate instead of glass or metal.</p>
      <p>The display and camera used to be two of the most obvious indicators that you were using a budget handset but even these fundamental pieces of phone hardware have improved massively in recent years. Entries like the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/redmi-note-7-3696516/">Xiaomi Redmi Note 7</a> highlight this shift perfectly.</p>
      <p>There are also devices, like the Motorola <a href="http://techadvisor.co.uk/review/budget-smartphones/moto-g7-power-3692402/">Moto G7 Power</a>, which place a focus on excelling in one specific area (in this phone's case, battery longevity) whilst still feeling like a more conventional affordable phone in other respects.</p>
      <p>One other advantage of buying a more affordable smartphone is that, if you're after a contract, such devices are more likely to come with zero upfront costs, lower monthly pricing and, potentially, shorter-term plans. As such, they also make great first-time options for those new to smartphones, those who are accident-prone and kids.</p>

      </p>
      <p>One of the most affordable members of Samsung's A-series smartphones, the Galaxy A20e still boasts powerful features, like a dual-sensor main camera that features a 13MP primary sensor with an impressively wide <i>f/</i>1.9 aperture, alongside an ultrawide-angle secondary 5MP snapper, with a 123° field of view.
