      <p><b>JOHANNESBURGÂ (AP)</b> - An estimated 45 million people are threatened with hunger due to a severe drought that is strangling wide stretches of southern Africa.</p>
      <p>International aid agencies said they are planning emergency food deliveries for parts of South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and other countries hard hit by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures as summer approaches in the southern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>The U.N. World Food Program said southern Africa has received normal rainfall in just one of the past five growing seasons, which particularly hits small-scale farmers who depend on rain for their crops. The U.N. food agencies plan to distribute emergency food aid to 11 million people in the coming months.</p>
