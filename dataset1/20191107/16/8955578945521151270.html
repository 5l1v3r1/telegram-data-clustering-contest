Genre diversity is also preserved: the program includes drama, comedy, as well as historical, adventure, family and documentary movies.</p>
      <p>"This year’s Oscar long list in the category" Best Foreign Language Film" included the drama "Ivan"(Slovenia), which won eight awards at the 2017 National Film Festival, and the adventure epic "Pilgrimage" (Portugal)... The historical drama of Latvian cinematographers "Father Night" will fight with other foreign films for a place on the short list of the Oscar Award", – the press service adds.</p>
