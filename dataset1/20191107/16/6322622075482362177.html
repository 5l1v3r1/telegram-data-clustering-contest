      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) will continue to push the use of gas as a cleaner source of fuel, compared with solid and liquid fuels.</p>
      <p>Its senior vice president (corporate strategy) Mazuin Ismail said this was one of the moves to promote greater use of cleaner energy source in the energy mix.</p>
      <p>He said gas would also be complementing renewable energy resources as it was abundant, flexible, stable and easy to be transported and reached.</p>
      <p>“It is the cleanest hydro carbon fuel and we have been playing a great role in moving gas into fuel mix.</p>
      <p>“Petronas has been delivering liquefied natural gas (LNG) since 1983 and has delivered more than 10,000 cargos without fail.</p>
      <p>“This means that we can convince the world that LNG is viable, reliable, safe and clean energy,” he said during a panel session on Balancing Economic Growth with Environmental Sustainability at the Malaysia SDG Summit 2019 here today.</p>
      <p>Mazuin said in line with the aim of enhancing the use of cleaner energy, the national oil company also recently increased its portfolio in renewable assets and now had a solar generation business in Malaysia and India.</p>
      <p>Petronas announced its foray into the renewable energy industry in April with the acquisition of Singapore-based Amplus Energy Solutions Pte Ltd, a leading rooftop solar power producer in India. Last month, Petronas launched its first solar rooftop solution in Malaysia called M+ , which it described as a customisable and affordable solution for both commercial and industrial use.</p>
      <p>“Economic growth needs energy; thus it is important to balance all the demand according to the country’s needs, policy, and regulations.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, we need to also change our behaviour on how we consume energy so it's not at the expense of tomorrow’s livelihood,” he added.</p>
