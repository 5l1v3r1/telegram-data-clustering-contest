07 Nov 2019, 16:15 by 投資
區議會選舉投票日期為2019年11月24日(星期日)，投票時間為早上7時30分至晚上10時30分。對於投票資格、投票地點及選民須知等，自己區的區議會選舉候選人，相信選民都略懂一二。不過，鑑於近日社會氣氛，對於區議會選舉是否如期進行，不同界別持不同意見。近日股市回升不少，市場相對穩定，對於投資者來說，可能會擔心若區議會選舉改期，或對股市有所影響。

區議會選舉改期 影響股市樓市
香港出現經濟衰退，歸因反修例風波所致。對於整體港股大市，後市策略仍以揀股不揀市為重心。而原本已步入跌浪的香港樓市，因林鄭月娥在最新《施政報告》中放寬九成及八成按揭保險的樓價上限，馬上令樓市轉活，尤其是600萬至800萬元的單位，更是搶手。
港股至今日為止，連升6個交易日，創逾3個月新高。恒生指數最多抽升212點，觸及27,900點。恒指收報27,847點，升158點，升幅0.57%。若區議會選舉改期，投資者普遍擔心或對港股及樓市有所影響。
葉國謙：區議會選舉是否如期進行要視乎社會氣氛出現
對於區議會選舉是否如期進行，行政會議成員葉國謙認為政府應劃下死線，視乎現在至選舉前一星期、即是11月17日的整體社會氣氛後作決定。葉國謙對於日前區議會候選人的立法會議員何君堯在擺街站期間遇襲受傷，形容事件等同謀殺，他認為政府要保證有公平選舉環境。
他續指，如區選未能舉行，理論上最多可押後14天。若暴力事件持續，14天後依然未能舉行，政府須向立法會提交修訂法案。但在現時立法會的情況下，要快速通過可能性很低，屆時區議會便要停頓。
另外，由浸大及民權觀察組成的選舉觀察計劃就區議會選舉發表中期觀察報告指出，各區選舉主任運用酌情權處理參選人提名準則不一。報告建議，當局應在投票日前降溫紓解目前政治矛盾，公開承諾盡力使區議會選舉如期舉行。

District Council election new situation! Around Hong Kong stock market, the overall situation of the property market
07 Nov 2019, 16:15 by Investment
The polling date for District Council elections is November 24, 2019 (Sunday). The voting time is from 7:30 am to 10:30 pm. For the qualifications for voting, the place of voting and the needs of voters, candidates for district board elections in their own districts believe that voters have a little understanding of one or two. However, given the recent social climate, different districts have different views on whether the district board elections are on schedule. Recently, the stock market has rebounded a lot, and the market is relatively stable. For investors, it may be worried if the district board elections are rescheduled or have an impact on the stock market.

District Council election rescheduled, affecting the stock market
The economic downturn in Hong Kong was attributed to the storm of anti-reforms. For the overall Hong Kong stock market, the market outlook strategy is still focused on picking stocks and not picking markets. The Hong Kong property market, which has already entered the downturn, has relaxed the property price ceiling of 90% and 80% of the mortgage insurance in the latest Policy Address, and immediately turned the property market into a living, especially for units ranging from $6 million to $8 million. More sought after.
Hong Kong stocks have risen for six consecutive trading days, hitting a three-month high. The Hang Seng Index soared 212 points and hit 27,900 points. The Hang Seng Index closed at 27,847 points, up 158 points, or 0.57%. If the district board elections are rescheduled, investors are generally worried about or have an impact on Hong Kong stocks and the property market.
Ye Guoqian: Whether the district board elections are scheduled to happen depends on the social atmosphere
Regarding whether the district board elections are on schedule, Ye Guoqian, a member of the Executive Council, believes that the government should draw a line of death, depending on the overall social atmosphere of the week before the election, that is, November 17. Ye Guoqian, a member of the Legislative Council who was a candidate for the District Council, was attacked and injured during the street. He described the incident as murder. He believed that the government must guarantee a fair election environment.
He continued to refer to the fact that if the district election fails to be held, it can theoretically be postponed for up to 14 days. If the violence continues and it will not be held after 14 days, the Government must submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council. However, in the current situation of the Legislative Council, the possibility of rapid passage is very low. At that time, the District Councils will have to stop.
In addition, the Election Watch Scheme consisting of the Hong Kong and Civil Rights Watch issued a mid-term observation report on the district board elections. The district ROs used discretion to deal with the nomination criteria for the candidates. The report recommends that the authorities should cool down the current political contradiction before the polling day and publicly promise to make every effort to make the district board elections as scheduled.
