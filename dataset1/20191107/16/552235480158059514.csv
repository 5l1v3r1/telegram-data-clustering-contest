Hibs have announced that supporter director Tracey Smith has left her role with the club after suffering an intolerable level of abuse that led to her seeking police and legal advice.
Smith has departed after becoming uncomfortable with the toxic atmosphere some supporters have created between themselves and the club while also suffering what she described as ""relentless"" personal abuse.
While stressing that only a small minority indulged in the behaviour, Smith has decided to call time on her role as a result of the situation.
Fan discontent has been brewing for some time after a terrible start to the Premiership season that has seen Paul Heckingbottom relieved of his duties as manager.
 
Her letter has not been revealed in full by the club on their website but they have reproduced her backing the ownership of Ron Gordon and Chief Executive Leeann Dempster .
She said: “I will always be proud to support this great club and know we have the right people in charge and looking after it.
""It's been an honour and a privilege to be able to be called a director of Hibernian Football Club.”
Bruce Langham, the club’s Senior Non-Executive Director, said: “It is very disappointing and disheartening to lose Tracey, who has been an active, valuable, and hard-working member of the board who has done her very best to represent the views of supporters at Board level.
“Supporters who behave in this way should realise there can be consequences, in this case the loss of a colleague who contributed greatly to improving communications between fans and the board.”
