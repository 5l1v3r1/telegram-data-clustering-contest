The $199 Linux laptop is getting a lot of people excited
Pinebook Pro Unboxed, Booted, Then Taken Apart [Video]
07 Nov 2019, 16:29 by By Joey Sneddon




The second batch of Pinebook Pro pre-orders went live this week, just as buyers of the first wave begun to receive their devices!

And, naturally, as you‚Äôd expect, in true millennial tech ownership style, a swathe of Pinebook Pro unboxing videos started to sprout out of the web‚Äôs fertile mantle.
Including the following comprehensive run-through by YouTuber jpakkane1 (a link to which landed in the omg! tip box yesterday, so thanks Sadat!).
This 10 minute clip has everything you could possibly want to see: a literal unboxing; first boot experience; side-by-side comparison with (unfair klaxon sound) a 13.1‚Ä≥ MacBook (!); and connection to an external display.
AND should you make it all the way to the end there‚Äôs even some disassembly pr0n (if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing ofc üòâ).



YouTube isn‚Äôt the only outlet Pinebook Pro owners are using to share their first impressions. There‚Äôs a dedicated thread on the Pine64 forums; Twitter is awash with feedback (and the odd raised eyebrow); and owners are sharing photos over on Facebook (it still exists, I checked).
Buyers seem majorly impressed by the build quality of the Pinebook Pro and its magnesium alloy body
Overall, people seem majorly impressed by the magnesium alloy casing and build quality given the low price point of the Pinebook Pro (it‚Äôs a mere $199 after all).
Things are a little less rounded software wise, but I‚Äôd expect as much given that desktop Linux on ARM hardware (regardless of OS) remains very much a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù ‚Äî but hey: software CAN be improved.
The Pinebook Pro sounds like it‚Äôs an eminently usable (i.e. fast enough) Linux laptop that, in many instances, could replace a Chromebook (there‚Äôs even a build of ChromiumOS for it) or iPad for couch-based web surfing.
If you‚Äôve been mulling a purchase, perhaps some of this collective feedback will help you make up your mind!

Thanks Sadat
