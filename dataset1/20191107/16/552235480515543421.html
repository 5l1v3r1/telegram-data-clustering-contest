      <p>Film crews were spotted in Hamilton today (Thursday, November 11).</p>
      <p>Jock Stein Sports Centre’s car park is being used as a base for the filming equipment for this year’s Hogmanay episode of BBC sports comedy  Only an Excuse.</p>
      <p>The team are keeping their equipment at the centre while they film at the nearby University of the West of Scotland</p>
      <p>Professor Craig Mahoney, principal and vice-chancellor of UWS, said: “We were delighted to welcome the cast and crew of Only an Excuse to our Lanarkshire campus to shoot scenes for the upcoming Hogmanay programme.</p>
      <p>“It is fantastic to see such a buzz around the university and it is testament to the campus’ flexible and modern facilities that it has been chosen to be part of what is an incredibly popular Scottish sketch show.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to watching the episode to see our amazing campus in action,”</p>
      <p>The show, which stars Jonathan Watson, features sketches, spoofs and gags and comic characters putting the boot into the headlines that have dominated Scottish football and Scottish life over the past 12 months.</p>
