      <p>Black Lips, who are currently touring the UK, previously admitted that they’d like to play in North Korea, after a show in Kurdistan confirmed their reputation for playing in unexpected places.</p>
      <p>“Not to get too political, but I’m a gatherer of all people. I would play in Afghanistan, I would play in North Korea”, said singer Cole Alexander.</p>
      <p>“Although North Korea does make me a bit nervous because there was this American kid [Otto Warmbier]. He stole a poster or something and he was severely punished.</p>
      <p>“Having said that, I would play North Korea. We have friends at our label who go there. They’re pretty extreme. I think if you go and you’re respectful, people will treat you with respect back.”</p>
