      <p>The event honouring Britain’s war dead has been held in the Abbey grounds since November 1928, when only two tribute crosses were planted.</p>
      <p>This year, some 70,000 crosses have been planted on more than 360 plots for regimental and other associations to commemorate those who died in the service of others.</p>
      <p>Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, observed a two-minute silence after laying their crosses.</p>
      <p>It was the seventh time Harry, who served two tours with the British army in Afghanistan, had attended the event.</p>
      <p>Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, wife of Harry’s father Prince Charles, had also been due to attend but withdrew because of a chest infection.</p>
