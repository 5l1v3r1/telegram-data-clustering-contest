But what shocked fans the most, is that there is also another Twitter account in the tweets @exoonearewe which fans, of course, clicked on. To their surprise, its the birth of another mystery account for a comeback. The second one after @PathcodeEXO in 2014.  Their Instagram page and smtown site also have X-versions. Share in the comments below when did you join the fandom and which side are you on?EXO or X-EXO?
