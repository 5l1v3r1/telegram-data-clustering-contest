Leigh Whannell, known for writing the first three Saw movies as well as the Insidious movies, has a new scare for us in the form of The Invisible Man. The man himself may be invisible, but there’s a new trailer for us all to watch that’s dropped today.
An adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name and a reboot of the 1933 movie based on it, The Invisible Man marks the second entry in Universal’s Dark Universe. Originally meant to star Johnny Depp, the movie was rejiggered following the flop of The Mummy, and turned into more of a stand-alone entry than a continuation of the franchise.
The film stars Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, whose abusive boyfriend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) seemingly commits suicide. As she begins to pick up the pieces of her life, it becomes clear that something if wrong. Cecilia becomes convinced that Adrian discovered a way to make himself invisible and is continuing to abuse her, but she’s met with disbelief from everyone around her.
Griffin has always been a villain, but this new take on the material makes that particularly evident by putting Cecilia at its center and turning invisibility into a way of interrogating when we do or don’t believe women’s stories about their abuse.
The film is set to hit theaters on Feb. 28, 2020.
