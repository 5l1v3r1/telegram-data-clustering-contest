Harold Mokoudi came so close to becoming an Aston Villa player last year.
The 21-year-old defender was on Steve Bruce’s radar in the summer of 2018 and was jetted into Birmingham to check out the club’s facilities ahead of a £7million transfer.
Moukoudi decided against a move to England at that time, though, and stayed at French club Le Havre.
He started the season in Ligue 2 extraordinarily well with a series of solid displays at the heart of defence.

But Moukoudi refused to sign a new contract with Le Havre and having been released, he joined Saint-Etienne in July.
He’s made nine appearances for the Ligue 1 side this season but is set to be at the centre of yet another transfer episode in the coming weeks.
 
Former Leicester City boss Claude Puel took over at Saint-Etienne last month and doesn’t see Moukoudi as part of his plans going forward.
Reports in France claim that he’ll be made available for an early exit in January as part of a clear-out at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.
 
Villa are highly unlikely to renew their interest with Dean Smith having signed four centre-backs on permanent deals in the summer.
Bjorn Engels and Ezri Konsa were brought in after Tyrone Mings and Kortney Hause had their loan stints converted into full-time deals.
