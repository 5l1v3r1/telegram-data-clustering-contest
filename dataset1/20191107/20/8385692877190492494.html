      <p>Most Chromebooks are pretty nice these days, and this HP Chromebook in particular is a wonderful option, and it's <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now.</p>
      <p>The sale price is not the only to love about this HP <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/best-chromebooks-laptops-holiday-gift-guide-2019-2020.html">Chromebook</a> though. One of its defining features is that it's actually a 2-in-1 device. Because of this feature, you can use it like a laptop.</p>
      <p>You can also use it like a tablet if you want because it also has a touch screen. Versatility is the name of the game here and is something that makes it that much more functional.</p>

      <p>As for the size of the display, this is a 14-inch laptop. So it's not too big nor is it too compact either. It's a tad smaller than a 15-inch laptop, so it should be fairly easy to fit into most bags. This in addition to its lightweight build make it extremely portable.</p>
      <p>As Chromebook specs go, the hardware here sits kind of towards the top. It has 8GB of RAM which is really plenty for a Chromebook, and it has 64GB of internal storage for all of your files. It also supports expandable storage if you need it.</p>
      <p>It's using an 8th-gen Intel Core i3 processor so the CPU isn't too out of date. Meaning, performance will be pretty good for whatever you need. If you're a gamer, you'll even be able to use it for playing games on Stadia once the service launches.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>At a sale price of $349, this HP Chromebook that's also a tablet is a steal. Especially when you consider its normal price of $599, so you're saving $250. Worth mentioning is that the laptops has a 360-degree design. So you can flip the screen all the way around so it sits flat. You can also prop it up in the tent mode like it has a kickstand, which is perfect for viewing or playing games.</p>
