      <h1>Rockefeller Christmas tree cut down, on its way to Manhattan</h1>
      <h2>Tree from Florida, New York</h2>

      <p>FLORIDA, New York (CNN) - The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/rockerfeller-christmas-tree-2019-trnd/index.html">Christmas tree that will light up Rockefeller Center</a> this holiday met its end -- in the spirit of the season, of course.</p>
      <p>A tree-cutting crew arrived at Carol Schultz's home in village of Florida, New York, early Thursday morning to saw into her winning 77-foot Norway spruce. The sacrificial tree is already headed to its Manhattan pedestal.</p>
      <p>A small crowd of local schoolchildren and beaming neighbors cheered as workers sawed into the base of the tree, held upright by a crane, and gasped as it lowered at an angle onto the bed of a truck, where it'll rest during the journey to 30 Rock.</p>
      <p>Like any proud mom, Schultz recorded the process of her beloved tree's shining moment. She'll still miss the behemoth in her yard.</p>
      <p>"I'm so excited and sad at the same time," she told CNN affiliate <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/hudson-valley">Spectrum News Hudson Valley</a>, rocking a pair of Christmas-tree-shaped sunglasses. "It's like part of me -- the tree is part of me."</p>
      <p>This is only one of several steps to get the spruce to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/rockefeller-center-tree/index.html">tree-lighting ceremony</a>. The unadorned tree will debut in Rockefeller Center on Saturday, but staff take nearly a month to get it gussied up for the holiday.</p>
      <p>Finally, on December 4, the fully festive tree will glow for the first time, flanked by famous musicians and the Radio City Rockettes in the televised tradition.</p>
      <p>At the end of its run in Rockefeller Center, the <a href="https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/">tree is gifted Habitat for Humanity</a>, which uses the tree for lumber to build homes.</p>
