Death Stranding comes to PlayStation 4 on Friday, but it won’t be the only game that will let you transport a Bridge Baby across treacherous lands while undead creatures try to kill you. No, you’ll be able to do the same (OK, similar) thing in open-world biker survival game Days Gone.
Bend Studio, which contributed to Death Stranding’s development along with Guerrilla Games, is adding Death Stranding-inspired bike tanks, decals, and frame paint to Days Gone with patch 1.6. Those free cosmetics include a tank with BB inside, which kind of gives the impression that BB’s just floating around in some 87-octane gasoline.
You can see two of those new Death Stranding tanks in Bend Studio’s tweet below.
