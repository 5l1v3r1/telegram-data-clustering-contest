      <h1>Olivier Ntcham’s last-gasp goal fires Celtic into Europa League knockout stages</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:26:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Olivier Ntcham’s dramatic injury-time winner against Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico sent Celtic into the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>The Hoops arrived in Rome at the summit of Group E after beating the Italian side last month but amid a shaky start they fell behind in the seventh minute when striker Ciro Immobile volleyed in a cross from Manuel Lazzari.</p>
      <p>However, Neil Lennon’s side fought back and winger James Forrest deservedly levelled in the 38th minute with a terrific finish.</p>
      <p>And in the fifth minute of added time at the end of a thrilling game, midfielder Ntcham, on for Ryan Christie, finished a counter attack to secure a 2-1 win.</p>

      <p>It was Celtic’s first win in Italy in 13 attempts and kept them top of Group E with a guarantee of European football after Christmas.</p>
      <p>With two fixtures remaining Celtic have 10 points with Cluj on nine, Lazio on three and Rennes on one.</p>
      <p>This was a sporting encounter played against a background of some controversy and acrimony.</p>
      <p>The Curva Nord section of the ground was closed after Lazio’s fans were found guilty of racist chanting during the 2-1 win over Rennes in October.</p>
      <p>Both Lazio and Celtic were charged for fans’ “illicit chants” in their meeting in Glasgow, with the Scottish champions also sanctioned for “illicit banners”.</p>

      <p>In addition, two of the 8,000 Celtic supporters who travelled to Rome had been stabbed on Wednesday night and security was tight in and around the stadium.</p>
      <p>Jonny Hayes, Hatem Elhamed and Christie returned to the Celtic side which was set up to match Lazio but they were pinned back early before conceding.</p>
      <p>When Lazzari curled in a cross from deep, the ball skipped off the head of Hoops defender Christopher Jullien and Immobile, totally unmarked, took no time in thrashing the ball past keeper Fraser Forster.</p>
      <p>Celtic had to come out their shell and they did but in the 20th minute it took a timely tackle from defender Kris Ajer to thwart Immobile when he was left with only Forster to beat after skipping easily past Elhamed.</p>

      <p>Then, only a brilliant block by Christie prevented Immobile testing Forster with another effort.</p>
      <p>However, Celtic’s foothold in the game became stronger and they went in at the interval level after a horror mistake by Francesco Acerbi, who let Mohamed Elyounoussi’s pass slip under his foot and Forrest rifled in from an angle.</p>
      <p>While the travelling fans celebrated, Forster saved a header from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and then was bailed out when he flapped at the consequent corner, with Jullien clearing Felipe Caicedo’s effort off the line.</p>
      <p>However, it was Lazio who appeared more grateful to hear the half-time whistle and looked no more composed after the interval as a bullish Celtic side threatened to take the lead.</p>

      <p>Lazio sent on Luis Alberto and club captain Senad Lulic for Jony and Lucas Leiva but there was little improvement.</p>
      <p>There was a Lazio penalty claim in the 66th minute when Immobile’s drive appeared to be blocked by the arm of Jullien but referee Tobias Stieler took no notice.</p>
      <p>Play stretched further in the final stages. A corner from Alberto rebounded off the post before Celtic striker Odsonne Edouard failed to hit the target with a drive following a counter attack.</p>
      <p>Forster made decent saves from substitute Valon Berisha, on for Denis Vavro, and Alberto before Ntcham took a pass from Edouard and chipped keeper Thomas Strakosha for the most dramatic of endings.</p>
