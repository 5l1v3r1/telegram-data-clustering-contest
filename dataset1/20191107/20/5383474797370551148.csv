Students took off their hardcore hangouts for the sake of money, in the end they got the money themselves
07 Nov 2019, 20:55 by Ilya Sidorov
For eight years, I‚Äôm Shmacked (I‚Äôm in g *** o) posted videos of parties from various US universities. Rollers gained from 100 to 500 thousand views.
Most of the videos were shot by the students themselves. They paid money for the opportunity to Instagram I‚Äôm Shmacked at their college. In exchange for this, they were promised earnings of up to $ 30 thousand.
It soon became clear that the head of I‚Äôm Shmacked turned out to be a scammer. He took money, but did not keep his promises. The victims began to receive threats.
What did I‚Äôm Shmacked do and why did students give her money


Arya Tufanian

I‚Äôm Shmacked was founded in 2011 by amateur director Jeffrey Ray and student Arya Tufanian. At that time they were 19 and 20 years old respectively.
At first, they traveled around the United States and filmed parties. The videos were uploaded to their YouTube channel, which quickly gained popularity. He currently has 41.6 thousand subscribers, and the total number of views is slightly more than 7 million.
Example of shooting a party at the University of Miami (I'm at *** about: University of Miami. Weekend)

Participants began to receive threats
