      <p>An elite police officer who helped arrest the son of El Chapo was shot 155 times in a brutal car park execution.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old officer, identified only as Eduardo, is reported to have been killed outside a shopping centre in the city of Culiacan. </p>
      <p>He had helped detain Ovidio Guzman, El Chapo's son, last month.</p>
      <p>He was promptly released.</p>
      <p>According to local media, the victim was a member of the operation launched by the Culiacan authorities to arrest El Chapo’s son and extradite him to the United States.</p>

      <p>Reports said that Guzman was detained on October 17 during a confrontation between the police and supporters of the Sinaloa Cartel in the city of Culiacan.</p>
      <p>Alleged gang members loyal to Guzman then caused chaos on the streets and El Chapo’s 28-year-old son was promptly released by the authorities, according to local media.</p>
      <p>The footage shows the moment a red car follows a white car into the car park before at least two gunmen reportedly shoot the cop 155 times.</p>
      <p>Reports said the victim became a National Police officer in 2013 and last held a position in the security outfit for the undersecretary of public security Carlos Alberto Hernandez Leyva.</p>

      <p>It is unclear if the cop was on duty at the time of the attack although he was reportedly carrying a gun with him.</p>
      <p>The secretary of public security Cristobal Castaneda Camarillo and his undersecretary Hernandez Leyva both showed up at the crime scene on the same morning to supervise the investigation.</p>
      <p>The local authorities are investigating the incident although they have yet to establish whether a criminal gang was behind the alleged assassination.</p>
