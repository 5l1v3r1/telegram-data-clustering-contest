        <b>It seems that after his channel reached 100 million subscribers this summer, Pewds is now nurturing a plan to become the world’s richest game developer, as his new brainchild will be a gacha-type game – a genre that tends to be very profitable.</b>

      <p>PewDiePie will soon delight his fans with his new game called Pixelings. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911061077234421-pewdiepie-weighs-in-on-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-controversy/">The YouTube star</a> has once again teamed up with Outerminds Inc., which developed his last two games – Legend of the Brofist, a platformer, and Tuber Simulator, where gamers are tasked to try their hand at blogging.</p>
      <p>Not much is known about Pixelings, which appears to be a turn-based strategy with elements of idle gameplay. Players will be able to collect cartoonish creatures, assemble them into teams, and compete with other gamers in 1 on 1 and 3 on 3 battles. Pewds has voiced the dialogues for the game, which is expected to be full of jokes and memes.</p>
      <p>The video posted by Outerminds features a description that reads: "Trouble has been brewing across the land. A mysterious being has been consuming Pixeland’s inhabitants. It’s up to you and PewDiePie to defeat the threatening invaders and restore order to Pixeland’s different worlds".</p>

      <p>Pewds’ next project could become a lucrative one, as it is a gacha game, which induces players to spend money on new characters and upgrades. Pixelings will be released on 15 November and will be available both on iOS and Android.</p>
