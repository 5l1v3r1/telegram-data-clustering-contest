      <p>Emmerdale viewers are expecting a double baby twist is on the horizon, after Kerry's one-night stand with Cain Dingle was exposed to daughter Amy, and Cain's wife Moira.</p>
      <p>Cain got drunk and slept with the grandmother of his son Kyle in retaliation to his own heartache.</p>
      <p>Last month saw him discover wife Moira had been having an affair with farmhand Nate Robinson, who then turned out to be his secret son.</p>
      <p>Nate has been trying to make amends ever since over his bid for revenge against dad Cain, not realising until recent scenes that he didn't even know he existed.</p>
      <p>Moira also wanted to make things up to Cain, who is determined they're over for good.</p>

      <p>But in the latest episode of the ITV soap, Kyle's mother Amy was repulsed to find out Cain and her mum Kerry had slept together.</p>
      <p>She ended up storming out after issuing her mother some home truths.</p>
      <p>Now, with both Moira and Kerry having had flings in recent weeks viewers are predicting one of them or even both of them will fall pregnant.</p>

      <p>This is soap land after all, and how else to make a dramatic affair even more dramatic than a baby bombshell.</p>
      <p>Viewers think Kerry will discover she is pregnant with Cain's child.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but viewers are wondering if Moira will also uncover her own pregnancy with husband Cain's son Nate.</p>

      <p>One viewer put: "I reckon Kerry and Moira will both end up pregnant ..."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Yea Kerry is gonna get pregnant."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "I’ve got a feeling Moira is pregnant - this Nate story is going to drag on for ages and I think there will be a paternity mystery."</p>
