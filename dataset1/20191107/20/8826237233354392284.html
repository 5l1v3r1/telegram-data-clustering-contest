      <p>(SANTA ROSA, Calif.) â€” Officials say three firefighters have received minor injuries as they battled a wildfire that has been burning in rural Northern California since Sunday.</p>
      <p>The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says the firefighters all were treated and released.</p>
      <p>More than 1,200 firefighters are trying to tamp down the 6-square-mile (15-square-kilometer) blaze in steep terrain northwest of Paradise, where the deadliest wildfire in state history ignited a year ago Friday.</p>
      <p>Cal Fire says cooler weather helped firefighters build more containment lines. The blaze is a third contained as of Thursday.</p>
      <p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
