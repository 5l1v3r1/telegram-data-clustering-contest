      <h2>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs help - and he does not believe Ed Woodward is the right man to provide it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:13:58+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes insists Ed Woodward is not a "football man" - and pleaded for former team-mate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be given help at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side have experienced a miserable start to the season with his rebuild off to a stuttering start.</p>
      <p>They have been linked with a number of January signings but the Norwegian boss this week played down hopes of major additions by declaring: "It's always the summer... you canâ€™t really do too many big deals in January."</p>
      <p>Scholes expressed doubts that United have the right men behind the scenes to bring in the talent Solskjaer needs to restore them to former glories as he urged executive vice-chairman Woodward to bring in help behind the scenes amid reports they are looking for a sporting director.</p>

      <p>Speaking on BT Sport ahead of United's clash with Partizan Belgrade, Scholes said: "We know behind the scenes there is help needed, especially on the football side.</p>
      <p>"You look at the business side and it's great, Ed Woodward is very good at that. But as a football man? I don't think he's a football man.</p>
      <p>"In the past had Sir Alex and David Gill. David Gill was brilliant, absolutely brilliant, and he's been a massive miss for football club. He knew football players inside out.</p>

      <p>"He knew a good player when he saw one and he disagreed with the manager, of course he did.</p>
      <p>"Now is the time where there needs to be a bit of help for Ole. Don't get me wrong, there's some good people around - the chief scout, Mike Phelan, great experience.</p>
      <p>"But now is the time when he really needs some help to really bring some top players to this club."</p>

      <p>Another former United star, Owen Hargreaves, agreed with Scholes and told United recruitment is vital to close the gap on runaway Premier League top two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Hargreaves added: "I completely agree with Scholesy.</p>
      <p>"It's going to take time to build it back up, but they need to start.</p>
      <p>"Recruitment is the one place they need to get right. City and Liverpool got it right, and that's why they are where they are."</p>
