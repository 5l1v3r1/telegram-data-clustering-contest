      <p>If you're in the market for a new TV then check out the Samsung NU6900 Series. Especially, as it is currently on sale.</p>
      <p>These are Samsung 4K UHD smart TVs and available in a number of sizes. Typically, these are OK priced TVs, but still expensive enough.</p>
      <p>For example, the 75-inch model retails for $1,099 in the U.S. This is the 2018 version and although it's now last year's model, the TV has still maintained a $999 price in most places.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>That's until now. Right now the 75-inch NU6900 TV can be picked up for just $749. Either through <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7692744/type/dlg/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/uhd-tvs/75--class-nu6900-smart-4k-uhd-tv--2018--un75nu6900fxza/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://geni.us/ghnFn22">Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-75-class-led-nu6900-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr%2F6290167.p%3FskuId%3D6290167">Best Buy</a>.</p>
      <p>Technically, Amazon is probably your best bet as the online retailer is currently selling it a couple of dollars cheaper than the others. Right now it's down to $747.</p>
      <p>For this price, and considering the size of the TV, this is a nice opportunity to <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">save money</a> while supersizing your TV.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Besides the massive screen and the 4K (and HDR10+) support, this TV also features upscaling technology. The idea here is to upscale non-4K content to 4K.</p>
      <p>Regardless of what you're watching, you'll be watching the best version of it, and on a Samsung display.</p>
      <p>As this is a Samsung TV, the NU6900 Series comes running on Samsung's own Smart TV platform.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>One of the benefits of Samsung's platform is the use of the "Universal Guide." Basically, Universal Guide acts as a one-stop location for content from different apps and even different devices.</p>
      <p>No more switching between apps and more time watching your favorite TV shows and movies.</p>
      <p>Speaking of other devices, and as you might expect, this Samsung TV plays nice with many devices, and especially smartphones.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Not only can you sync your smartphone with the TV, but you can also use the Samsung SmartThings app to control the TV.</p>
      <p>All that plus 75-inches to play with, and all for under $750.</p>
