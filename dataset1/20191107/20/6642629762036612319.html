      <p>A New York judge has ordered US President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> to pay two million dollars to several charities to resolve a lawsuit alleging he misused his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests.</p>
      <p>Judge Saliann Scarpulla said Trump "breached his fiduciary duty" to the Trump Foundation, the relationship with the organisation's trustees, by allowing his campaign staff to plan a fundraiser for veterans' charities in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses before the 2016 presidential election.</p>

      <p>That event, which passed money through Trump's non-profit, was designed "to further Mr Trump's political campaign", Scarpulla said.</p>
      <p>The judge also signed off on agreements reached last month between Trump's lawyers and the New York attorney general's office to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/trump-foundation-shut-lawsuit-181218165331050.html">close</a> the Trump Foundation and distribute about $1.7m in remaining funds to other nonprofits.</p>
      <p>In the agreements, Trump admitted to personally misusing Trump Foundation funds and agreed to pay back $11,525 in the organisation's funds he spent on sports memorabilia and champagne at a charity gala. He also agreed to restrictions on his involvement in other charitable organisations.</p>
      <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James heralded the resolution of the case as a "major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain".</p>
      <p>"No one is above the law - not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the president of the United States," said James, a Democrat.</p>
