      <p>The challenge over Catalonia's independence has become a focal point of Spain's Sunday elections, with street clashes, burning cars, and smashed windows all serving to fuel a hardening stance against separatists among political parties.</p>
      <p>One consequence is that it could be very difficult to form a government if no outright winner comes through — as is widely expected.</p>
      <p>Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialist party still leads in the opinion polls but are expected to fall well short of a majority, which means they will need to strike deals in order to stay in power.</p>
      <p>But his tougher stance on Catalonia from the last few days will make a left-wing government alliance more complicated as potential ally Unidas Podemos sees opening a dialogue with the separatists as the only solution.</p>
      <p>And clinching support from the Catalan separatist parliamentarians may be harder now than before.</p>
      <h3>But what are some other key elements shaping the next Spanish election?</h3>
      <h4>Voter apathy</h4>
      <p>With four elections in the last four years, this election campaign of only eight days has been the shortest in history. The turnout is expected to drop considerably on Sunday.</p>
      <h4>Rise of the far-right</h4>
      <p>After the Barcelona riots, the last polls saw Vox go up to a third position, outperforming the liberals of Citizens and Unidas Podemos. It is projected to win 40-49 seats, possibly doubling its presence in parliament.</p>
      <p>Vox "understands the values of all good Spanish people", Barcelona resident Juan Ignacio Izquierdo said at a party rally in the city. "Catalonia is Spain and the line is unbreakable."</p>
      <p>As for the more moderate right, the People's Party has scored better than before but the centre-right Ciudadanos is collapsing due to internal fighting.</p>
      <p>Polls predict that the elections will not hand the right-wing bloc a majority even though no possibility can be ruled out as the number of undecided voters remains high.</p>
      <h4>Not enough support for Más País</h4>
      <p>The new leftist party Más País could not get the required number of votes to enter Congress, according to the latest polls, even if it got a lot of media coverage in Spain.</p>
      <p>All parties are well aware that voters do not want a fifth election, and they might have to strike a deal in the end.</p>
