      <p>Commuters were given paws for thought when they spotted a dozen <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets">golden retrievers</a> lining up on their own — to wait for a train.</p>
      <p>The adorable dogs, dubbed "good boys and girls" by witnesses, were spotted patiently waiting on the platform.</p>

      <p>More than 30 thousand social media users shared a picture of the golden dogs waiting at Barnes Station, in southwest London, and posted hilarious puns about why they could be waiting. One called the scene a meeting of “Very Important Puppies,” while another branded it the “Andrex puppy reunion.” (Andrex, a brand of British toilet tissue, often features an "Andrex puppy" in its marketing campaigns.)</p>
      <p>The dogs were gathered on the platform for a photo as part of a charity calendar to raise money for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.</p>

      <p>A total of 26 dogs posed at 13 locations across Barnes, including one shot of a handsome pair enjoying a “dog date” at the cinema.</p>
      <p>Four perky retrievers were also captured as they strode across a crosswalk in another shot imitating the Beatles’ iconic "Abbey Road" album cover.</p>
      <p>The calendar was the brainchild of Anne Mullins, who set up the Barnes Golden Group – “The BGs” — to exchange information relevant to fellow dog owners.</p>

      <p>Mullins said, “Dog owners are such a beautiful lot, so I thought it would be fun to do a calendar and give the proceeds to a dog charity.<br/> <br/>“Ours are a pampered, much loved lot and not all dogs are.”</p>
      <p>Mullins teamed up with fellow dog lovers Sophie Farrah and Tom Farrah-Pearce to plan and shoot the calendar.</p>
      <p>The trio chose a range of locations in Barnes, including a park, cafe, a grocery store, as well as the crosswalk and the train station.<br/> <br/>Mullins added, “The dogs were all securely tied to the railings on a platform that’s no longer used — so all very safe.</p>
      <p>“And commuters took lots of photographs which they then tweeted.”</p>

We are incredibly grateful to everyone who worked on this adorable fundraising project for supporting Battersea in such a fun and creative way and we cannot wait to see the full calendar when it’s finished.”</p>
