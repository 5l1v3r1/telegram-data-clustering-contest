BOHINJ - At 15.25, a mountain climber fell on his leg while walking on the Zagradec mountain pasture in Bohinj. Due to his injury, he was unable to descend himself, so the rescue workers of the Bohinj GRS came to his aid in a classic way, dropping him about 400 meters down the rope. On arrival at the point of departure, he was handed over for further care, reports the Administration for Protection and Rescue.
