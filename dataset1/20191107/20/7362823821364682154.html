      <p>Another day, another odd-scented offering from a major restaurant chain.</p>
      <p>Perhaps taking a page out of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/jimmy-deans-holiday-gift-exchange-rewards-participants-with-sausage-scented-wrapping-paper">Jimmy Dean’s</a> or even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/kfc-debuts-gravy-scented-candle">KFC’s</a> playbook, Chili’s is offering customers the chance to win a “baby back ribs-scented candle” as part of its latest delivery promotion.</p>

      <p>The restaurant chain, which originally launched its delivery options in June, has delivered to 1.7 million users, Chili's said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chilis-opened-1-700-000-new-restaurants-say-what-300953095.html">press release</a> on Wednesday. In celebration, Chili’s is offering free delivery to anyone who orders through the restaurant's website or app through Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all.</p>
      <p>Those who “share their experience” with Chili’s delivery by uploading a photo of their meals on social media and tagging Chili’s in the post will be eligible for a “starter pack” containing the rib-scented candle, as well as a doormat, TV tray, trivia card game and a chip bag clip.</p>

      <p>"We get it. Our guests don't always have the time or want to leave the comfort of their homes. I deeply understand because I love being on the couch with my boys in my jammies binge-watching TV," said Ellie Doty, senior vice president and chief marketing officer. "And that's exactly why you need a #ChilisMyHouse starter pack in your life.”</p>
      <p>In addition to its starter packs -- which will be doled out to “randomly chosen” social media users -- Chili’s will host a “Chili’s My House” sweepstakes, which will reward one My Chili’s Rewards member with a “Chilified” room in their home.</p>
      <p>In other words, Chili’s will come by and deck out a room with flourishes that may include “new furnishings, potted greenery, custom art and/or furnishings, new paint/wall coverings and/or window dressing, new accessories, new rugs [and/or] lighting swap-outs,” according to the <a href="https://chilismyhouse.com/">sweepstakes’ website</a>.</p>
