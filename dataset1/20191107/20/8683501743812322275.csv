Henry Golding Admits He Used To Interview Harry Potter Stars Like Daniel Radcliffe Before He Got Famous

Henry Golding is certainly becoming an “it” guy in Hollywood, having appeared in a couple of notable features recently, including Crazy Rich Asians and A Simple Favor. Yet acting is only the latest in a long line of jobs he’s held over the years. In fact, he recently revealed he was once a red carpet reporter covering projects like the Harry Potter films starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.
During a recent episode of The Late Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Fallon and Henry Golding got to talking about the myriad jobs he had before becoming an actor. One of them involved interviewing celebrities on the red carpet, and he told a fun story about how he felt interviewing a ""young"" Daniel Radcliffe before he himself was famous.
I covered all of the Harry Potter stuff, so Daniel Radcliffe, when he was quite young at that time, I used to sort of be infatuated with him. I remember just like shaking nervously just sort of asking those questions. Waiting in those hot rooms, interviewing all of these amazing people.
Elaborating on what he used to do before he became an actor, he talked a little bit about talking his way from being a hairdresser into being a presenter, as well as touching base about how he himself used to be on the other side of the carpet, including interviewing the cast of big franchises such as Harry Potter.  He said:
I used to be on that end of the interview. Sort of. I used to go to red carpet events and stand in line and wait for stars to come pass. I’d sort of call their name and ask for interviews. Then, I made the switch to sort of being on the red carpet, on that side.
I always sort of love hearing about what celebrities did back before they were idolized by people around the world. The more mundane the previous job, the more interesting it usually is to me. A lot of times celebrities are put onto a sort of pedestal by the public, but stories like these go a long way to humanize people we also love seeing playing characters on the big screen. In the past, Henry Golding has talked about struggling with getting famous after so much time as an anonymous human, and this story ties right in.
If you’d like to take a look at the full interview, you can do so below. Spoiler alert: he also talks about James Bond.



Next up, you can catch Henry Golding in Last Christmas, the Paul Feig movie also starring Emilia Clarke. The new movie is out in theaters this weekend, along with a slew of other titles (including Doctor Sleep). You can see how the competition might fare with our full movies schedule.
