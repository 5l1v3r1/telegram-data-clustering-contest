      <h1>Fazl warns of chaos if demands not met</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:17:10+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, whose supporters are encamped in Islamabad in an anti-government protest dubbed as ‘Azadi March’, has warned of chaos if the demands he has put forth are not met.</p>
      <p>In an interview to <i>Dawn News </i>on Thursday, the JUI-F chief said their protest will not end until the “incompetent” government resigned; stressing that fresh elections in the country was the only solution to the present crisis.</p>
      <p>“There will be chaos in the country… can’t say what might happen [in the days to come],” he told the interviewer. “We will not attack… [rather] will embrace martyrdom,” he added. “We are ready to sacrifice our lives…we will not leave…who do you think we are?”</p>

      <p>The protest will not end until the “incompetent” government resigned, Fazl continued. “I want to make it clear…I’ve drawn a red line… until and unless we oust this incompetent and illegitimate government, [we will not go back].”</p>
      <p>Asked if the opposition could resign from assemblies as well as the Upper House of Parliament, the senior politician said, “We’ve come here to take resignation, not to tender one.”</p>
      <p>Fazl said there was no solution to the crisis but the holding of new elections. “We want fresh elections, nothing else is acceptable,” he said. “Hold free and fair elections… which do not have interference from the military.”</p>

      <p>The JUI-F leader said he did not want the army to be politicised. “The army should not be called [to supervise the election],” he said, adding that the country had no system to investigate electoral rigging. “Fresh elections should be held under the supervision of the election commission.”</p>
      <p>Questioned if his team was in talks with Pervez Khattak or Pervaiz Elahi, he said, “We are not negotiating for a deal with anyone but if somebody comes to us, we do not turn them back.”</p>
