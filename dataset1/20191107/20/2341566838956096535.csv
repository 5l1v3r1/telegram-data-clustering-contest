（中央社記者余祥新竹縣7日電）韓國瑜國政顧問團總召張善政今天發布就保、勞退、勞保「勞動三箭」，將修法保障勞工在無薪假期間仍能獲得保險支付投保薪資的6成；政府同額補貼低薪青年勞工自提退休金；2年內編新台幣1000億元撥補勞保基金。
國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜日前展開全台傾聽之旅，韓國瑜今天走訪新竹縣，上午安排參訪竹東世光教養院以及拙茁家園，關懷弱勢族群，下午則在新竹喜來登飯店與科技青年對談。
張善政下午也陪同韓國瑜與青年對談，並在會後接受媒體聯訪。針對低薪勞工議題，張善政發布韓國瑜的勞動三箭。
在就保方面，張善政說，現在很多中部傳統製造業都在放無薪假，未來他們將修改就業保險法，讓無薪假也可以被保障，無薪假期間損失的薪水由保險支付投保薪資的6成。
此外，國政顧問團也發布新聞稿補充，未來也將把自僱型工作者和獨立工作者納入就業保險制度，並修改就業保險給付規定，將申請第二胎及以上育嬰留職停薪勞工的津貼延長為9個月。
在勞退方面，張善政提到，低薪勞工的薪水很難作為儲蓄，雖現在政府要求雇主每月提撥6%薪水到勞工「個人勞退專戶」，也開放勞工自提6%，但有93%的勞工沒有自提，可能是誘因不足。
張善政表示，他們設計誘因，針對35歲以下的低薪勞工，只要你願意提1%，政府就相對提1%，照顧勞工的退休生活；以上限6%、月薪3萬元為例，若勞工自提3%、每月900元，政府相對補貼900元，也就是政府一年補貼勞工達1萬800元。
在勞保方面，張善政說，蔡總統上任後說每年要撥補200億元到勞保基金，但現在一塊錢都沒提撥，只在明年預算中提200億元去補勞保基金的洞，根本杯水車薪。
張善政指出，若韓國瑜當選，他們準備在2021、2022年2年湊1000億元預算放到勞保基金中。
張善政說，一定會有人質疑錢哪裡來、不是國庫吃緊，但他們估算受惠勞工至少600萬到1000萬人，可以讓勞工安心在職場發揮；而1000億元當然不夠，勞保基金要趕快發揮投資績效，還有主權基金也要設法賺錢。
張善政表示，韓國瑜曾任北農總經理，他則在宏碁待了10年，他們兩人都在業界過，知道怎樣想辦法賺錢，但總統蔡英文、行政院長蘇貞昌完全不知道怎麼賺錢，國家預算不可能只靠稅收，應想辦法用活化資產去賺更多錢。（編輯：蘇志宗）1081107

Unpaid leave is paid by insurance for 60% of salary.
07 Nov 2019, 20:18 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Yu Xiang Hsinchu County 7th) South Korea's Yu Guozheng Advisory Group called Zhang Shanzheng today to release insurance, labor retreat, labor insurance ""three arrows of labor"", will be repaired to protect workers during the unpaid leave can still get insurance to pay insured wages 60% of the government; the government subsidizes low-paying youth laborers with the same amount of pensions; in the next two years, it has compiled NT$100 million to supplement the labor insurance fund.
KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea’s Yu, started a full-time listening tour. South Korea’s Yu visited Hsinchu County today. In the morning, he arranged to visit the Zhudong Shiguang Correctional Institute and his homeland to care for the disadvantaged groups. In the afternoon, he was at the Sheraton Hsinchu Hotel and the young people in science and technology. talk.
Zhang Shanzheng also accompanied the South Korean Yu and the young people in the afternoon and received a joint media interview after the meeting. In response to the issue of low-paid labor, Zhang Shanzheng issued three arrows for the work of Korean Yu.
In terms of insurance, Zhang Shanzheng said that many traditional manufacturing industries in Central China are now taking unpaid leave. In the future, they will amend the Employment Insurance Law so that unpaid leave can be guaranteed. The salary lost during the unpaid leave will be paid by insurance. 60%.
In addition, the State Administration Advisory Group also issued a press release to supplement, in the future will also include self-employed workers and independent workers into the employment insurance system, and modify the employment insurance payment provisions, will apply for the second child and above, the retention of unemployed labor The allowance is extended to 9 months.
In terms of retiring, Zhang Shanzheng mentioned that the salary of low-paid workers is difficult to save. Although the government now requires employers to pay 6% of their monthly salary to the ""personal retired account"" of workers, and open workers to raise 6%. However, 93% of the workers did not mention it, which may be insufficient incentives.
Zhang Shanzheng said that they designed incentives for low-paying workers under the age of 35. As long as you are willing to raise 1%, the government will raise 1% and take care of the retirement of workers. The upper limit is 6% and the monthly salary is 30,000 yuan. The labor rate is 3%, 900 yuan per month, and the government subsidizes 900 yuan. That is, the government subsidizes workers for 18,000 yuan a year.
In terms of labor insurance, Zhang Shanzheng said that after taking office, President Cai said that he would allocate 20 billion yuan to the labor insurance fund every year, but now he has not raised any money. He only raised 20 billion yuan in the budget next year to fill the hole in the labor insurance fund. A glass of water.
Zhang Shanzheng pointed out that if South Korea is elected, they are prepared to put a 100 billion yuan budget into the labor insurance fund in 2021 and 2022.
Zhang Shanzheng said that there must be people who question where money comes from, not because the state treasury is tight, but they estimate that at least 6 million to 10 million people will benefit from labor, so that workers can work in the workplace; and 100 billion yuan is certainly not enough. Investment performance, as well as sovereign funds, must also try to make money.
Zhang Shanzheng said that South Korea Yu was the general manager of North Agriculture. He spent 10 years in Acer. Both of them were in the industry and knew how to make money. However, President Tsai Ing-wen and Executive Dean Su Shichang did not know how to make money. It is impossible for the national budget to rely solely on taxation, and we should find ways to use the activating assets to make more money. (Editor: Su Zhizong) 1081107
