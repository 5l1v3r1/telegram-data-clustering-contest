      <h1>Shannon Briggs claims Logan Paul will be heavyweight world champion ahead of KSI rematch</h1>
      <h2>Paul takes on fellow YouTube star KSI in Los Angeles on Saturday night - and Briggs has predicted a bright future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Logan Paul has been backed to become a heavyweight world champion - but KSI has rubbished the idea.</p>
      <p>The two YouTube rivals clash in their eagerly-awaited rematch here in Los Angeles on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The pair fought to a controversial draw last August and will now finally settle their beef in the ring.</p>
      <p>Paul recruited former champion Shannon Briggs as his trainer - and the American has predicted a bright future for the social media influencer.</p>
      <p>"He's going to heavyweight champion in three to five years, mark my words, I did it twice," he said.</p>
      <p>"I got the blueprint; he is the specimen, he has the body, the agility, the athleticism, everything it takes.</p>

      <p>"I became heavyweight champion of the world after less than 40 fights; his amateur career is going to be at home and he's going to fight pro; three to five years.</p>
      <p>"He's young, he's 24, what's the rush? By the time he's 27 he's going to be in contention.</p>
      <p>"Boxing changes every week, every month. A guy's the heavyweight champion and then he's gone.</p>
      <p>"In three to five years there may be no [Deontay] Wilder, there may be no [Tyson] Fury, I'm sure there won't because they're making too much money.</p>
      <p>"He will be around, he's doing it at home right now."</p>
      <p>Paul insists he will pursue a career in boxing after Saturday night with Briggs claiming he will fight 10-12 times next year and again in 2021.</p>
      <p>The American also wants to try his hand at mixed martial arts having wrestled at college in Ohio.</p>

      <p>KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - also plans to fight on after his clash with Paul at the Staples Center.</p>
      <p>But he has set his sights considerably lower than his rival's.</p>
      <p>"I will continue in boxing I wont be fighting Canelo [Alvarez] or boxing champions," he said.</p>
      <p>"I wont be like him (Logan) and vowing to fight and beat Anthony Joshua.</p>
      <p>"I can be smart with it; next I'll fight a proper pro who will be alright. I'll beat him and then build the card around that. I can do that easily in the UK."</p>
