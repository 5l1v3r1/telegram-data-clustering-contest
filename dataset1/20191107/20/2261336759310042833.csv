The MMA Vivisection - UFC Moscow: Magomedsharipov vs. Kattar picks, odds, & analysis
07 Nov 2019, 20:00 by Zane Simon and Connor Ruebusch



There’s pretty much no way that any UFC card that had to follow UFC 244 could be something other than a come down. And to that end, UFC Moscow is appropriately under the radar with a night of decently well booked action, some interesting prospects, and a good top contenders bout to cap it all off—if not much else in the way of meaning. Should Zabit Magomedsharipov beat Calvin Kattar, it seems likely he’d get the next crack at the featherweight title.
