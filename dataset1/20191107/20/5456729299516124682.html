      <p>The Nigeria Army on Thursday inaugurated a General Court Martial to prosecute 70 erring personnel found defaulting in the counter insurgency operation in the North East.</p>
      <p>Abdul Khalifa, the Acting General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division, said the court was inaugurated in accordance with Section 131(2) (d) of the Armed Forces Act, CAP A20 LFN 2004.</p>
      <p>Mr Khalifa, a brigadier general, said the court would exercise its duties within the confines of the law and military regimentation principles.</p>
      <p>He added that principles of justice, equity and fairness would guide the proceeding of the court.</p>
      <p>Mr Khalifa said the aim was to encourage compliance with ethical standard and promote discipline to ensure successful implementation of military operations.</p>
      <p>“Acts of cowardice, desertion, un-soldierly and other forms of indiscipline has no place in any army executing war,” he said.</p>
      <p>The commander however enjoined the court members to be fair in<br/>discharging their duties. (NAN)</p>
