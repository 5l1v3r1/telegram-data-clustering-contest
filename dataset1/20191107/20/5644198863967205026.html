      <p>REUTERS: Wall Street's main indexes were set to hit record highs on Thursday, boosted by signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations and a fresh batch of largely upbeat earnings reports.</p>
      <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is eyeing its fifth straight week of increases, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to log six weeks of gains.</p>

      <p>China said on Thursday that it had agreed with the United States to remove tariffs in phases, while the state-owned Xinhua News Agency said Beijing was also considering removing restrictions on poultry imports.</p>
      <p>"This is fuelling optimism that a trade deal will be solidified at some point," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>"It removes a veil of uncertainty and gives the market a green light for a risk-on path."</p>
      <p>Trade-sensitive industrials 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc rose over 1per cent in premarket trading. Chipmakers with a sizeable exposure to China, including Intel Corp , Micron Technology and Nvidia Corp , were up between 1per cent and 1.7per cent.</p>
      <p>Also supporting tech stocks was a 5.6per cent gain in Qualcomm Inc shares after the chipmaker forecast current-quarter profit above analysts' estimates.</p>
      <p>Nearly three-quarters of the 383 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far have beaten profit expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>At 8:46 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 152 points, or 0.55per cent. S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 11.5 points, or 0.37per cent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36 points, or 0.44per cent.</p>
      <p>Ralph Lauren Corp jumped 9.6per cent after it topped second-quarter profit expectations, driven by tighter control on expenses and strong demand for its Polo shirts and tweed jackets in China and Europe.</p>
      <p>Expedia Group Inc dropped 14per cent as the online travel booking company missed quarterly profit estimates.</p>
      <p>Roku Inc plunged 15per cent after posting a wider net loss in the third quarter, as it spent more to attract subscribers to its video streaming platform.</p>
      <p>Twitter Inc fell 1.6per cent after Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to "underperform" from "in-line".</p>
