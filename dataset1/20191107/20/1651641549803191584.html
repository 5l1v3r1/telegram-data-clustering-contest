      <h1>Apple’s newest iPhone 11 update fixes performance issues, premature app termination</h1>

      <p>Apple’s iPhones suffered from a bug last week which caused <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ios-13-2-may-be-killing-your-apps-faster-than-you-like/">apps to get kicked out of RAM quickly than normal</a>. Despite the increased ram and performance, users were quickly finding that their apps wouldn’t stay in memory once they navigated away from them — no matter how briefly. Tabs in Safari would vanish like wisps in the wind, flled in messages would clear, and YouTube videos would reset back to the beginning.</p>
      <p>The new iOS 13.2.2 update has been rolled out to address this issue, fixing this along with a few others.</p>
      <p>Here’s the changelog:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes an issue that could cause apps to quit unexpectedly when running in the background</li>
        <li>Resolves an issue where iPhone may temporarily lose cellular service after a call</li>
        <li>Addresses an issue where cellular data may temporarily not be available</li>
        <li>Fixes an issue that caused replies to S/MIME encrypted email messages between Exchange accounts to be unreadable</li>
        <li>Addresses an issue where using Kerberos single sign-on service in Safari may present an authentication prompt</li>
        <li>Resolves an issue where charging may be interrupted on YubiKey Lightning-powered accessories</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The update is rolling out to iPhones and iPads running iPadOS today. While not being a massively huge update, it showcases the flexibility Apple has in rolling out updates to fix user-facing problems in (checks watch) just over a week since it debuted.</p>
