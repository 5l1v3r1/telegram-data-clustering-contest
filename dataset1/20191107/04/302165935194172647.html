      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 7 — There seems to be no end to former music mogul Yang Hyun-suk's woes.</p>
      <p>The South Korean police have reportedly booked the former entertainment giant YG Entertainment CEO for attempting to cover up for ex-iKON member B.I’s drug abuse.</p>
      <p>Korean pop culture site <i>Allkpop </i>reported that the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency booked Yang yesterday on charges of threatening, harbouring a suspect and occupational breach of trust.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that Yang had allegedly threatened former trainee Han Seo-hee into keeping quiet during B.I's drug use investigation in 2016.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another Korean pop culture website <i>Soompi </i>reported that allegations of Yang threatening Han to change her testimony came to light in June after Han reported to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission about suspicion of YG Entertainment’s corrupt ties with police.</p>
      <p>Han was arrested by police for using marijuana on August 22, 2016.</p>
      <p>During the first two rounds of questioning, Han admitted that she took marijuana with B.I and gave him LSD after he asked her to get it for him.</p>
      <p>She also submitted text messages exchanged between them as evidence.</p>
      <p>After a meeting with YG Entertainment, which allegedly took place on August 26, 2016, Han however changed her original testimony to say that B.I never did drugs.</p>
      <p>Last week, it was reported that South Korean police had wrapped up investigations on Yang and ex-Big Bang member Seungri on charges of habitual gambling.</p>
