【点滴网雅加达11月6日讯】全国银行协会(Perbanas)成员的银行家于周三(11月6日)上午举行了以巩固，提升为主题的2019年印尼银行业博览会年会。佐科威总统亦出席该活动。在还未由佐科威主持开幕式前，该活动始于财政部副部长苏哈希尔纳萨拉(Suahasil Nazara)的演讲。在演讲中他要求银行业继续推动其在我国经济中的作用。周三，他在雅加达史纳延Fairmont酒店称，“在这样的背景下，这就是国家收支预算(APBN)管理的背景，我们希望它将继续支持。因为银行业是我国金融部门的最大组成部分，其份额达80%。”接着由佐科威总统主持开幕式。他要求全国银行认真地降低贷款利率。因为印度尼西亚银行(央行/BI)已累次下调其基准利率或央行7天逆回购利率(BI-7DRRR)。佐科威说，“我邀请各位认真考虑降低贷款利率。其他国家的许多银行都已降低了银行贷款利率。这是下调其基准利率的其他国家的中央银行后续行动。”佐科威称，我国中央银行已经数次下调基准利率共100个基点(bps)至5%。他认为，通过这一步骤，全国银行必须立刻采取行动亦降低贷款利率。佐科威表示，“其他国家都已降低，降低，再降低了，而我们的央行利率也已下降，然而银行贷款利率却还没有。我等着。掌声意味着同意，请再次注意。”(xin)
