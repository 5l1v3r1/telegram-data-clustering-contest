連戰略儲備都用盡了：中國解禁加拿大牛豬進口、中企向丹麥買30億元豬肉
07 Nov 2019, 04:31 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是自從去（2018）年8月非洲豬瘟傳入中國，導致豬肉生產減少了40%，豬肉價格持續創新高，也影響全球豬價。



受非洲豬瘟影響，中國豬肉短缺，連戰略儲備也已耗盡，近期除了恢復加拿大進口豬牛肉類產品外，中國國企中糧集團也向丹麥皇冠肉品購買1億美元的豬肉，食品顧問公司調查認為，中國大量向外國進口豬肉恐怕要到2040年才能恢復2017至2018年的狀況。
《路透社》報導，中國國企中糧集團昨（6）日表示，將在明年從歐洲豬肉供應商丹麥皇冠品（Danish Crown）購買價值1億美元（約台幣30億元）的豬肉，以緩解中國因豬瘟導致的豬肉短缺。
2家公司在上海的國際進口博覽會簽署了初步採購協議。丹麥皇冠的銷售總監阿爾伯森（Lars Albertsen）表示，這將是該公司長期以來最大筆的交易，而且鑒於中國的巨大需求，交易可能「還會擴大」。
報導指出，自從去（2018）年8月非洲豬瘟傳入中國，導致豬肉生產減少了40%，豬肉價格持續創新高，也影響全球豬價，丹麥的豬肉價格已飆升至1997年以來的最高水平。同時東南亞也因為接連爆出非洲豬瘟，導致豬肉需求也在增加。
「儲備已耗盡」，中國恢復加拿大豬牛肉進口
面臨國內豬肉短缺，中國轉向世界各地採購豬肉，也在本月5日重啟與加拿大的牛豬肉進口。
中國在今年6月暫停進口自加拿大進口出肉，聲稱一批從加拿大運到中國的豬肉中發現瘦肉精，並發現該批輸中國的豬肉隨附的官方獸醫衛生證書是偽造的。不過外界認為，這是因中國與加拿大自從華為財務長孟晚舟於加拿大被捕後、以及2名加拿大人中國被捕的外交情勢所致，中國外交部並未就此做出回應。
如今中國恢復加拿大牛豬肉進口，加國前駐華大使趙樸（Guy Saint-Jacques）解釋，這是因為「中國豬肉儲備已耗盡，中國自巴西、歐洲能買的都買了，但疫情慘重遠超過他們的預期。現在中國 32個省都是疫情災區，差不多全中國都淪陷。」
「他們損失了多達1億頭豬。至少需要10年才能恢復正常。」趙樸表示。
中國豬肉持續增加，至少2040年才能恢復水準
《路透社》報導，食品顧問公司Gira報告指出，中國豬肉進口預計將在2022年達到頂點，之後由於國內養豬業從非洲豬瘟疫情恢復，進口開始下降，雖然到2025年進口量都還在高峰，不過價格將會開始下降。
Gira報告認為，非洲豬瘟將會改變中國人長期飲食習慣，部分消費者會把目標轉為價格較便宜的雞肉，豬肉市場也將縮小，預計疫情過後，中國豬肉市場規模僅剩疫情爆發前的80%。
Gira報告指出，中國直到2027年，才有望從非洲豬瘟疫情恢復，不過中國豬肉進口量若要回到2017至2018年的水準，Gira報告認為，還要等到2040年才行。
非洲豬瘟重創養殖豬大國，全球肉價接連上漲
《CNN》報導，中國對豬肉的需求佔全球豬肉總產量一半，但自非洲豬瘟爆發以來，該國減少了約1.3億頭豬，因為擔心病情傳染，許多農民不願再養豬。中國官方雖然一直補貼豬肉，從4月至9月中旬，政府向低收入家庭發放了約32億人民幣（約台幣139億元），使他們能夠繼續負擔得起吃豬肉的費用。9月的時候，中國當局也從中央儲備拍賣了3萬噸冷凍豬肉，以穩定價格。


北京搶救「中國豬」：補貼逾20億、有養豬任務還頒布「限肉令」


《經濟日報》報導，以往中國大多數都是在境內採購，但非洲豬瘟疫情爆發以來，中國養殖豬隻數大減逾1/3，導致境內豬價飆漲。為了滿足需求，中國開始大量進口肉品，也帶動全球肉品價格上漲。
如巴西對中國的禽肉出口較去年同期躍增31%，雞胸和雞腿的零售價格漲了16%；歐洲豬肉價格上揚5%；澳洲雜貨店的羊肉價格上漲14%，紐西蘭碎牛肉的價格創新高。西班牙豬肉商則說，最近連豬蹄等較便宜的部位也逐漸從當地市場上消失，因為這些肉品在中國能賣出更高的價錢。
《世界日報》報導，根據北京《金磚四國農業資訊》（BRIC-Agri Info）的數據顯示，去年12月，一公斤豬肉的價格約為22.50元人民幣（約台幣97元）。而根據中國商務部的數據，到今年10月，一公斤豬肉價格已躍升至42.46元人民幣（約台幣184元）。

Even the strategic reserves have been exhausted: China lifted the import of Canadian cattle and pigs, and Chinese enterprises bought 3 billion pork from Denmark.
07 Nov 2019, 04:31 by Abby Huang


What we want you to know is that since the introduction of African swine fever in China in August (2018), pork production has decreased by 40%, pork prices have continued to hit new highs, and global pig prices have also been affected.



Affected by African swine fever, China's pork shortage, and even strategic reserves have been exhausted. In addition to the resumption of Canadian imports of pork and beef products, China's state-owned COFCO Group also purchased 100 million US dollars of pork from Danish Crown Meat. It is believed that China's large import of pork to foreign countries may not be restored to the state of 2017 to 2018 until 2040.
""Reuters"" reported that Chinese state-owned COFCO said yesterday (6) that it will buy 100 million US dollars (about NT$3 billion) worth of pork from the European pork supplier Danish Crown next year to ease China. Shortage of pork due to swine fever.
The two companies signed a preliminary purchase agreement at the International Import Expo in Shanghai. Lars Albertsen, head of sales at Crown of Denmark, said that this will be the company's long-standing biggest deal, and that given the huge demand in China, the deal may ""expand.""
According to the report, since the introduction of African swine fever into China in August (2018), pork production has decreased by 40%, pork prices have continued to hit new highs, and global pig prices have also been affected. Danish pork prices have soared to the highest since 1997. Level. At the same time, the demand for pork is also increasing in Southeast Asia because of the explosion of African piglets.
""Reserve is exhausted"", China resumes Canadian pork and beef imports
Faced with a shortage of domestic pork, China turned to the world to purchase pork, and also restarted the import of beef and pork with Canada on the 5th of this month.
China suspends imports of meat from Canada in June this year, claiming that a group of pork meats shipped from Canada to China found cholesterol and found that the official veterinary health certificate attached to the Chinese pork was forged. However, the outside world believes that this is due to the diplomatic situation in China and Canada since the arrest of Huawei Finance Minister Meng Xiazhou in Canada and the arrest of two Canadians in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to this.
Now that China has resumed the import of Canadian beef and pork, Guy Saint-Jacques, the former ambassador to Canada, explained that this is because ""China's pork reserves have been exhausted. China has bought from Brazil and Europe, but the epidemic is heavy. Far more than they expected. Now China's 32 provinces are epidemic areas, almost all of China are falling.""
""They lost as many as 100 million pigs. It takes at least 10 years to return to normal."" Zhao Pu said.
Chinese pork continues to increase, and it will be restored to at least 2040 years.
""Reuters"" reported that food consultancy Gira report pointed out that China's pork imports are expected to peak in 2022, after the domestic pig industry recovered from the African swine fever epidemic, imports began to decline, although imports by 2025 are still The peak, but the price will start to fall.
The Gira report believes that African swine fever will change the long-term eating habits of Chinese people. Some consumers will turn their targets into cheaper chickens, and the pork market will also shrink. After the epidemic, the size of the Chinese pork market is only before the outbreak. 80%.
According to the Gira report, it is not until 2027 that China will recover from the African swine fever epidemic. However, if China's pork imports are to return to the 2017-2018 level, the Gira report believes that it will not wait until 2040.
African swine fever hits a big pig country, and global meat prices have risen successively
CNN reported that China's demand for pork accounts for half of the world's total pork production, but since the outbreak of African swine fever, the country has reduced about 130 million pigs, and many farmers are reluctant to raise pigs because of fear of illness. Although Chinese officials have been subsidizing pork, from April to mid-September, the government has distributed about 3.2 billion yuan (about NT$13.9 billion) to low-income families, so that they can continue to afford the cost of eating pork. In September, the Chinese authorities also auctioned 30,000 tons of frozen pork from the Central Reserve to stabilize the price.


Beijing rescues ""Chinese pigs"": subsidies of more than 2 billion, and the task of raising pigs has also issued a ""cutting meat order""


According to the Economic Daily, most of China used to purchase in China. However, since the outbreak of the African swine fever, the number of Chinese pigs has been reduced by more than 1/3, resulting in soaring domestic pig prices. In order to meet the demand, China began to import a large amount of meat, which also led to a rise in global meat prices.
For example, Brazil’s poultry exports to China jumped 31% year-on-year, and the retail price of chicken breasts and chicken legs rose 16%; European pork prices rose 5%; Australian grocery prices rose 14%, New Zealand ground beef The price has reached a new high. Spanish pork merchants say that the cheaper parts such as pig's trotters have gradually disappeared from the local market, because these meats can be sold at higher prices in China.
According to the World Daily, according to Beijing's BRIC-Agri Info, the price of one kilogram of pork was about 22.50 yuan (about NT$97) in December last year. According to the data of the Ministry of Commerce of China, by October this year, the price of one kilogram of pork has jumped to 42.46 yuan (about NT$184).
