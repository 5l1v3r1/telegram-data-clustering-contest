      <p>One of the fundraising organisers is Taylor McGee, who had been friends with Denai since their primary school days.</p>
      <p>Taylor told the Record of how Denai's death has rocked those left behind.</p>
      <p>She said: "We’re all trying to be strong but there’s definitely been a lot of tears.</p>
      <p>"We feel Denai’s death has brought us all together again as a group and together we all want to do our part to make sure she is remembered in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>"It’s come as a shock to us and still hasn’t quite sunk in that we won’t see our best friend again."</p>
      <p>Taylor said her friend was 'an amazing mum'.</p>
      <p>She added: "She would light up every room she went into.</p>
      <p>"She was a kind, caring person who was always laughing.</p>
      <p>"As soon as her son, Kalvin came into her life he was instantly her priority.</p>
      <p>"He meant the world to her and brought her so much happiness.</p>
      <p>"Denai was an amazing mum.</p>
      <p>"She always put Kalvin first and he absolutely adored her."</p>
