【歷史回眸】遠離中共 在港建中文大學的錢穆

07 Nov 2019, 04:27

1949年，當一些知識分子紛紛從香港北上去迎接「新中國的誕生」時，錢穆遷往香港。
在他看來，中共得天下，就意味著中國幾千年文化傳統的中斷，他在英國屬地香港，創建了香港中文大學的前身——新亞書院，以發揚中國文化為最高教育宗旨。
錢穆預言：「此下世界文化之歸趣，必將以中國傳統文化為宗主。」
靠自學 從鄉村教師到進入北大授課錢穆，原名恩鑅，字賓四，清光緒廿一年（1895年7月30日）生於江蘇無錫的七房橋。他7歲入私塾讀書，1911年因辛亥革命，中學學校停辦，他輟學後自學。18歲後，錢穆當了十年小學教師， 1922年以後，他又當了八年中學教師。
一直自學苦修的錢穆，致力於史學研究，1930年，因《劉向歆父子年譜》和《先秦諸子系年》兩篇著作，使學界人士對其推崇備至。後由顧頡剛推薦，錢穆被聘為燕京大學國文講師，講授中國上古史和秦漢史。
居北平八年，錢穆先後授課於北京大學、清華大學、燕京大學、北平師範大學等名校。
在燕大，錢穆見陳寅恪穿長袍，遂改穿長袍，一直堅持到老。當時北大名師雲集，戴金屬細邊眼鏡的錢穆，被學生評為北大最叫座的教授之一，學生中有「北胡南錢」之說，胡即指胡適，他倆都因以演講的方式授課而聞名。
一次，燕大校長司徒雷登宴請教師，錢穆直言，入燕大校門即見M樓、S樓，既然在中國，就該起中國名字。校務會採納了錢穆的建議，後將M樓改為穆樓，S樓改為適樓，樓貝公改名辦公樓，其它建築也都賦以中國名稱。校有一湖，因一時無名，就根據錢穆的提議取名「未名湖」。
抗日戰爭爆發後，錢穆隨北大南撤到雲南蒙自，期間他與詩人、考古學家陳夢家往來密切。陳夢家勸錢穆寫一本中國通史的教科書，後來在陳夢家的啟發下，錢穆一反此前中國通史的西方化敘事傾向，寫出《國史大綱》，它飽含強烈的道德意識與愛國熱情，展現出「對其本國已往歷史之溫情與敬意」，很快風行全國，成為各大學通用的歷史教科書。
而民族危亡之時，西學東漸，很多青年受中共革命文化的影響，當時閱讀的多是「左傾進步書籍」，以民族虛無主義為時尚，蔑視和貶低中國傳統文化，稱之為「腐朽沒落」。
錢穆二兒子錢行說，「1949年以前，好像真沒讀過父親的什麼書。那時我讀高中時，父親有次回來，見到三弟（錢遜）那裡有從蘇聯大使館要來的《列寧選集》，曾經把我們召集在一起教育一番。但是當時也不怎樣接受……其實那時候的青年學生，和後來的紅衛兵運動也差不多，很狂熱的。」
錢穆勸兒子看《曾國藩家書》，不要看那些「馬列的書」，不要上當、相信那些東西。但後來兒子們與馬克思列寧主義接觸，都參加了學生運動，自認為「進步、革命」，逐漸遠離了父親。
錢穆在學生時代，也曾參加過學潮，但在北平、西南執教期間，錢穆不支持學運，因為中共宣傳馬克思主義，鼓動階級鬥爭與唯物史觀，與他的傳統理念相悖。錢穆後來離開了西南聯大，也與當時校園激進的左傾思想有關，「聞一多公開在報紙罵余為冥頑不靈。……凡聯大左傾諸教授，幾無不視余為公敵。」
預感在赤色中國難有容身之地「以中華文化民族意識為論旨」的《國史大綱》，受到蔣介石的賞識。1942年，蔣介石約見錢穆，錢穆拒絕了，次年，蔣介石再度約見錢穆。提倡宋明理學的蔣介石，與錢穆思想非常相合。後來，錢穆再次受蔣介石的邀請，與馮友蘭一起去重慶，為國民黨中央訓練團講演。期間，為錢穆安排的每餐飯蔣介石都要親自去看，親口品嚐是否合口。蔣介石還請錢穆負責《宋元明清學案簡編》裡清代部分的編寫。
錢穆多次讚揚孫中山先生所創立的「五權憲法」、「五院制度」，尤其考試制度、監察制度，認為充分體現了中國傳統精神，錢穆的價值觀與中共倡導的馬列格格不入。
1949年4月，中共軍隊越過天塹長江，挺進江南，很多知識分子面臨去與留的抉擇。錢基博先生的孿生兄長錢基成，對中共懷有深望，屢勸錢穆留下。錢穆問他，「您研究古文辭，您看看軍隊渡江的那篇文告，有無大度包容之氣象？」錢基成不語。
從文告中，錢穆當時就預感到，赤色中國難有他容身之地。而那篇文告正是出自毛澤東之手。
1949年8月，毛澤東發表評論《丟掉幻想，準備鬥爭》，點名批評胡適、傅斯年和錢穆三人，說他們是「被帝國主義及其走狗的中國反動政府」所能控制的「極少數人」。
錢穆認為自己「單槍匹馬，一介書生」，「足跡不到京、滬、平、津，不在公立學校教書」，「怎麼會找到我頭上」。此文發表之前的四個月，胡適已經去了美國；八個月前，傅斯年去了台灣。
當時，錢穆正應香港華僑大學之邀，赴廣州任教。10月，錢穆囑託蘇州城防司令隨時照顧家小，然後自己隨華僑大學遷至香港，妻子和五個孩子都留在了大陸。
在香港創辦中文大學 以發揚中國文化為最高宗旨錢穆在香港見到許多彷徨的流亡青年走投無路，於是有了創辦大學的想法，「我覺得自己是從事教育工作的人，怎忍眼看他們失學。同時，也覺得自己只有這一條適當的路可以走。雖然沒有一點把握，但始終認定這是一件應當做的事。」
自認流亡知識分子的錢穆，一邊在《民主評論》上發表文章，一邊與謝幼偉、唐君毅、崔書琴等學者，在九龍偉晴街借用華南中學的三間課室，籌辦「亞洲文商學院」，夜間上課，由錢穆任院長。
1950年秋，上海商人王岳峰在九龍深水埔桂林街61—65號購得新樓三楹，供作新校舍。校舍簡陋，沒有圖書館。亞洲文商更名為「新亞書院」，改為日校，錢穆出任院長。
學校經費困難，辦公室晚上就是臥室。錢穆自奉節儉，先是棲身在校舍打地鋪，後搬到貧民區，再搬到偏遠鄉村租房。他每天搭巴士、火車上課，立定講壇，舌耕不輟。
學生幾乎全部是來自內地的流亡青年，很多露宿在學校天台、樓梯上。師生不到百人，學費收入僅有20%，每月虧空多達三千多港幣。後來蔣介石一直幫助了四年，數年後，學校獲得美國耶魯、哈佛的援助，蔣介石才開始停止撥款。
錢穆公開在校刊上撰文，指出：「本書院創始，在一九四九年之秋，當時因有感於共產黨在中國大陸刻意摧殘本國文化，故本書院特以發揚中國文化為教育之最高宗旨……在今日民主主義與極權鬥爭之下，中國青年在思想上應有正確的認識，以免誤入歧途，既誤其本身前途，亦遺害於國家民族以及世界和平。」
1958年的一天，錢穆的長子錢拙接到一封父親來信。信中說，人民公社搞得這麼糟，還要辦公共食堂，家家戶戶把自己的鍋灶都打掉，吃公共食堂，「這不是亂了套嘛！」
1963年，新亞書院、崇基學院、聯合書院三校合併為大學，68歲的錢穆親定校名為「香港中文大學」。 在英國屬地香港，有了第一所中文教學的大學。
1966年，「文化大革命」開始，大陸大中學校一度陷於停頓。據錢穆夫人胡美琦回憶，錢穆日夜在長廊上走來走去，一言不發，持續一兩個月之久。一天，錢穆突然說，他要編一部《人人自修國文讀本》，這樣將來即使教師和課程都沒有了，也可以此為研讀文言文籍的國人開一門徑，挽救傳統文化中斷的危機。
父子異途錢穆畢生信仰中國傳統文化，重視儒家家庭倫理，尤重父子之情。初到香港時，錢穆曾經與余英時一家看電影，內容是關於親子之情的。想起在大陸的兒女，錢穆當時禁不住悄然淚下，而錢穆向來是能夠「以理馭情」的。
1950年，錢穆寫信給留在大陸的三個兒子，希望他們到香港讀書。當時中共貶斥錢穆「賣國」，受輿論影響，兄弟三人認為父親「逃港」即是不愛國的行為。當時18歲的二兒子錢行，甚至將毛的報紙文章寄給錢穆。錢穆想與子女團聚的願望沒有實現。
1949年後，因錢穆反共的立場，子女的工作與生活都受到了株連，他們也曾以所謂「愛國」大義責備父親。
當錢穆在國外創建大學傳播中國傳統文化時，三子錢遜在國內清華大學的講台上，當了二十多年的馬列教師，教授辯證唯物主義與歷史唯物主義。
錢行後來被舉家下放，女兒錢易也被下放到江西開荒種地。為避免牽連，錢穆和子女斷絕了書信往來。
在中共的集權高壓下，錢穆父子異途，父慈子孝各不可得。直到三十一年後的1980年，子女們才與父親重聚，錢穆其時已85歲。而錢行藉助赴港探親的事由，才找機會辦了返城手續。
錢遜讀父親的著作時，已年近五旬，曾經叛逆的錢遜，為自己曾經批判國學而感慚愧；錢行70歲時，以「畢明邇」為名，發表文章替父親辯駁：「中國的幾千年說成都是封建、都是專制，是錢先生所最反對的。……有皇帝，不等於就是專制，反之，沒皇帝了也不等於就沒專制。」
錢穆死後，胡美琦公開發表文章談到，與子女相見時，錢穆一直等待子女向自己道歉或者做個說明，文革時孩子為什麼用那麼「革命」的態度對待自己的父親，但錢穆沒有等到，心中耿耿卻難以言表。@*#（待續）

[History Review] Away from the CCP's Qian Mu, a Chinese University in Hong Kong

07 Nov 2019, 04:27

In 1949, when some intellectuals went north from Hong Kong to meet the birth of ""New China,"" Qian Mu moved to Hong Kong.
In his view, the CCP’s gain in the world means the interruption of China’s thousands of years of cultural tradition. He founded Hong Kong’s predecessor, the New Asia College, in Hong Kong, the British territory, to promote Chinese culture as the highest educational purpose.
Qian Mu predicted: ""The interest in world culture will be dominated by traditional Chinese culture.""
From self-study From the rural teacher to the Peking University to teach Qian Mu, formerly known as Enshi, the word Bin four, Qing Guangxu one year (July 30, 1895) was born in Wuyi, Wuyi, Jiangsu. He entered private school at the age of seven. In 1911, due to the Revolution of 1911, the middle school was closed. He dropped out of school after school. After 18 years old, Qian Mu became a primary school teacher for ten years. After 1922, he became a secondary school teacher for eight years.
Qian Mu, who has been self-study and self-study, is devoted to the study of historiography. In 1930, due to the two works of ""The Year of Liu Xiangfu's Father and Son"" and ""The Years of the Pre-Qin Dynasty"", academics admired it. After being recommended by Gu Yugang, Qian Mu was hired as a lecturer in Chinese literature at Yanjing University, teaching Chinese ancient history and Qin Han history.
In the eight years of Peiping, Qian Mu has taught at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, and Peiping Normal University.
In Yan Da, Qian Mu saw Chen Yu wearing a robe, tampering with a robes, and insisting on being old. At that time, the famous teachers of Peking University gathered, and Qian Mu, who wears metal thin-rimmed glasses, was named one of the most famous professors at Peking University. Among the students, there was the saying of “Northern Hunan Money”. Hu refers to Hu Shi, both of whom are speaking by way of speech. Known for teaching.
Once, Stuart, the principal of Yanda, invited the teacher to dinner. Qian Mu said bluntly that he would see the M building and the S building when he entered the Yan University campus. Since he is in China, he should start the Chinese name. The school council adopted Qian Mu's suggestion. Later, the M building was changed to Mulou, the S building was changed to the appropriate building, and the Loubeigong was renamed the office building. Other buildings were also given the Chinese name. There is a lake in the school. Because it is unknown, it is named ""Unnamed Lake"" according to Qian Mu's proposal.
After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Qian Mu withdrew from North Danan to Yunnan Mengzi, during which he was close to the poet and archaeologist Chen Mengjia. Chen Mengjia advised Qian Mu to write a textbook on Chinese general history. Later, inspired by Chen Mengjia, Qian Muyi countered the westernized narrative tendency of China's general history and wrote the Outline of National History. It contained a strong moral consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm, showing "" The warmth and respect for the history of the country has quickly become popular throughout the country and has become a history textbook common to all universities.
At the time of the national peril, Western learning gradually grew up. Many young people were influenced by the revolutionary culture of the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, most of them read ""Left-Leading Progressive Books"", which used national nihilism as fashion, despised and degraded Chinese traditional culture, and called it ""corruption and decline"". .
Qian Mu’s second son, Qian Xing, said, “Before 1949, I didn’t seem to have read any of my father’s books. When I was in high school, my father came back once and saw the third brother (Qianxun) who came from the Soviet embassy. The ""Lenin's Anthology"" once brought us together to educate. But at that time, it was not accepted at the time... In fact, the young students at that time were similar to the later Red Guards movement, and they were very fanatical.""
Qian Mu advised his son to read ""Zeng Guofan's Family Book"". Don't look at those ""Marxist books"". Don't be fooled and believe in those things. However, after the sons contacted Marxism-Leninism, they all participated in the student movement and thought that they were ""progressive, revolutionary"" and gradually moved away from their fathers.
Qian Mu also participated in the student movement in his student days. However, during his teaching in Beiping and Southwest China, Qian Mu did not support the student movement because the CCP publicized Marxism and encouraged class struggle and historical materialism, which was contrary to his traditional ideas. Qian Mu later left the Southwest Associated University, and it was also related to the radical left-leaning thought of the campus at that time. ""When Wen Yiduo was publicly in the newspaper, he was stubborn."" Wherever the General Assembly left the professor, there is nothing to ignore the remaining enemy.""
It is foreseen that Chiang Kai-shek appreciates the ""Guide to National History"", which is based on the Chinese culture and national consciousness. In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek met with Qian Mu, and Qian Mu refused. The following year, Chiang Kai-shek once again met with Qian Mu. Chiang Kai-shek, who advocated the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming Dynasties, is very much in line with Qian Mu's thought. Later, Qian Mu was once again invited by Chiang Kai-shek to go to Chongqing with Feng Youlan to give a speech to the Kuomintang Central Training Corps. During the period, Chiang Kai-shek, who is arranged for Qian Mu, will go to see it personally and taste whether it is a mouthful. Chiang Kai-shek also asked Qian Mu to be responsible for the preparation of the Qing Dynasty in the Compendium of the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties.
Qian Mu has repeatedly praised the ""five-power constitution"" and ""five-institutions system"" created by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, especially the examination system and supervision system. He believes that the traditional Chinese spirit is fully embodied, and Qian Mu’s values are incompatible with the Marxist-inspired CCP.
In April 1949, the Chinese Communist Party crossed the Yangtze River and marched into the south of the Yangtze River. Many intellectuals faced the choice to stay and stay. Qian Jibo, the brother-in-law of Mr. Qian Jibo, has a deep hope for the CCP and has repeatedly advised Qian Mu to stay. Qian Mu asked him, ""When you study the ancient Chinese remarks, do you look at the article of the army crossing the river, is there a weather of generosity?"" Qian Jicheng said nothing.
From the statement, Qian Mu pretended that it was difficult for him to have a place in China. And that statement is from the hand of Mao Zedong.
In August 1949, Mao Zedong issued a commentary, ""Throwing Off Fantasy, Preparing for Struggle"", naming Hu Shi, Fu Sinian and Qian Mu, and saying that they are ""very few people"" that can be controlled by the Chinese reactionary government of imperialism and its lackeys. .
Qian Mu thinks that he is ""single-handedly, a scholar"". ""The footprints are not in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Tianjin. They don't teach in public schools."" ""How can I find me?"" Four months before the publication of this article, Hu Shi had already gone to the United States; eight months ago, Fu Sinian went to Taiwan.
At that time, Qian Mu was invited by the Huaqiao University of Hong Kong to teach in Guangzhou. In October, Qian Muyu asked the Suzhou City Defense Commander to take care of his family at any time, and then moved to Hong Kong with Huaqiao University. His wife and five children stayed on the mainland.
Establishing the Chinese University in Hong Kong to promote Chinese culture as the highest aim Qian Mu has seen many embarrassing exiled youths in Hong Kong have nowhere to go, so they have the idea of starting a university. ""I feel that I am a person engaged in education work, how can I bear to see them out of school. I also feel that I can only go with this proper path. Although I have no grasp, I always believe that this is something that should be done.""
Qian Mu, who believes in exile intellectuals, published an article in the ""Democracy Review"" and, with scholars such as Xie Youwei, Tang Junyi and Cui Shuqin, borrowed three classrooms in Huanan Middle School in Weiqing Street, Kowloon to organize the ""Asian Business School"" and attend classes at night. Dean by Qian Mu.
In the autumn of 1950, Shanghai businessman Wang Yuefeng purchased a new building at the 61-65 Guilin Street, Shenshuipu, Kowloon, for the new school building. The school building is simple and there is no library. The Asian cultural and trade name was changed to ""New Asia College"" and changed to a day school. Qian Mu became the dean.
School funding is difficult, and the office is the bedroom at night. Qian Mu pays homage to the festival. He first lives in the school building and then moves to the slum area before moving to a remote village to rent a house. He took classes on buses and trains every day, set up a pulpit, and worked hard on his tongue.
Almost all of the students are exiled youth from the mainland, and many of them are sleeping on the rooftops and stairs of the school. There are less than 100 teachers and students, and the tuition fee is only 20%. The monthly deficit is more than 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. Later, Chiang Kai-shek had been helping for four years. A few years later, the school received assistance from Yale and Harvard in the United States, and Chiang Kai-shek began to stop funding.
Qian Mu publicly wrote an article in the school magazine, stating: ""The founding of the book was founded in the autumn of 1949. At that time, because of the feeling that the Communist Party deliberately destroyed its own culture in mainland China, the book institute promoted Chinese culture as the highest purpose of education. ... Under the current struggle for democracy and totalitarianism, Chinese youth should have a correct understanding of their minds so as not to go astray, not only to their own future, but also to the national and world peace.""
One day in 1958, Qian Mu’s eldest son, Qian Qi, received a letter from his father. The letter said that the people's communes have done so badly, they have to work together in the cafeteria. Every household has knocked out their pots and eaten public canteens. ""This is not a mess!""
In 1963, the New Asia College, Chung Chi College, and the Union College were merged into a university. The 68-year-old Qian Mu was named ""Hong Kong Chinese University."" In the British Hong Kong, there is the first Chinese language teaching university.
In 1966, the ""Cultural Revolution"" began, and mainland Chinese schools were once in a state of stagnation. According to Mrs. Qian Mu’s memory, Mr. Qian Mu walked up and down the promenade day and night, and said nothing, for a month or two. One day, Qian Mu suddenly said that he would compose a ""Reading a Chinese for Self-study"", so that even if teachers and courses are not available in the future, it can also open a path for the people who study classical Chinese characters to save the crisis of traditional cultural disruption.
The father and son have a long-term belief in Chinese traditional culture, paying attention to Confucian family ethics, especially the father and son. When I first arrived in Hong Kong, Qian Mu once watched a movie with Yu Yingshi, and the content was about parent-child love. Thinking of the children in the mainland, Qian Mu could not help but shed tears, and Qian Mu has always been able to ""learn and sens"".
In 1950, Qian Mu wrote to the three sons who remained on the mainland, hoping that they would study in Hong Kong. At that time, the CCP deprived Qian Mu of ""selling the country"" and was affected by public opinion. The three brothers believed that his father ""escaped from Hong Kong"" was unpatriotic. At the time, the 18-year-old second son, Qian Xing, even sent Mao’s newspaper article to Qian Mu. The desire of Qian Mu to reunite with his children has not been fulfilled.
After 1949, due to Qian Mu’s anti-communist stance, the children’s work and life were all connected, and they also blamed their father for the so-called “patriotism”.
When Qian Mu established a university to spread Chinese traditional culture abroad, Sanzi Qianxun was a teacher of Marxism for more than 20 years at the platform of Tsinghua University in China, teaching dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
After the money was later released by the family, his daughter Qian Yi was also sent to the land of Jiangxi. In order to avoid being implicated, Qian Mu and his children cut off the correspondence.
Under the CCP’s centralized power, Qian Mu’s father and son are different, and the father’s filial piety is not available. It was not until 1980, thirty-one years later, that the children reunited with their fathers, and the money was 85 years old. With the help of visiting relatives in Hong Kong, Qian Xing took the opportunity to go back to the city.
When Qian Xun read his father's work, it was nearly fifty years old. Qian Xun, who was rebellious, felt embarrassed that he once criticized Guoxue. When Qian Xun was 70 years old, he published an article for his father in the name of ""Bi Mingxi"": ""China's thousands of years of feudalism are all authoritarian, and they are the most objectionable to Mr. Qian. ... There is an emperor, not equal to autocracy. On the contrary, if there is no emperor, it does not mean that there is no autocracy.""
After Qian Mu’s death, Hu Meiqi publicly published an article saying that when he met his children, Qian Mu had been waiting for his children to apologize to themselves or to make a statement. Why did the children treat their fathers with such a “revolutionary” attitude during the Cultural Revolution, but Qian Mu did not wait, in his heart It’s hard to say. @*#(to be continued)
