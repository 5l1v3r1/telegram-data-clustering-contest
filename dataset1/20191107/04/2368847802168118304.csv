新疆女街頭跳舞後被警車拉走 外國觀察員被騙慘

07 Nov 2019, 04:19

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】中共在新疆大規模迫害維吾爾人，遭到國際社會強烈譴責。中共在國際高壓下，被迫允許一些國際觀察人士到新疆考察。但有觀察員披露，中共雇佣臨時演員在街頭表演，等外國遊客走後，這些跳舞的新疆女子就被警車拉走。
英國紐卡素大學研究語言教育的博士生布多夫對加拿大《環球郵報》披露，她在新疆喀什發現奇怪的事情，在大街上翩翩起舞的維族群眾，在外國遊客離開之後，就被警車集體帶走了。
布多夫馬上意識到，這些跳舞的維族女子，其實是中共當局安排的臨時演員。報導稱，一位近日逃到英國的維族婦女透露，今年早些時候，警察和官員來到她家，要求她年老的父親，在某個特定日子去清真寺祈禱，每次給20元人民幣，每天有100元。
她還透露，一些中共政府信任的維族人，比如她的一位當漢語教師的朋友，也曾被要求上街扮演行人，並且必須背下最少50個問題，用以應對外國觀察人員提問。顯然，中共試圖矇混過關，雇佣群眾演員欺騙這些外國考察團。
另據《環球郵報》披露，一些外國視察人員抵達新疆的時候，街上所有的人，包括公共汽車司機、小攤販、遊人、出租車司機、在寺廟中祈禱的信徒，全部都是由當局雇佣的人臨時充當，有時幹脆由警察直接扮演。
布多夫女士在過去18個月，曾經3次到新疆考察，她發現最近街面上的監視攝像頭大量消失了，成群結隊全副武裝的警察少了，街上的檢查站也明顯鬆懈了很多。
除了對新疆街頭的改造，中共政府還把一些集中營的高牆和電網拆除，邀請外國觀察者前往參觀，再由被關押者講述他們在集中營中的所謂「美好生活」。
不過，加拿大阿爾巴尼亞裔記者賈澤西發現其中的問題，他直接表示，「這一切都是表演」，集中營的警察「根本就是在騙我們，他們希望我們向世界報導出假相」。
賈澤西在追問被關押者信仰問題的時候，從他們眼中看到了恐懼，以及瞥向警察的哀求的眼神。
然而，一些外國觀察者，尤其是中東和中亞國家的觀察人士，仍然會選擇相信中共官方的說法。
近年來，中共政府將上百萬新疆維族人非法拘禁在「再教育營」，而教育營的恐怖黑幕也持續被曝光。29歲的維吾爾族女子米娜（Mihrigul Tursaun）2018年1月被關入當地惡名昭彰的再教育營，她在去年華府舉行的記者會上披露了在再教育營的恐怖遭遇。
米娜憶述，自己曾在國外生活過，會說外國語言，當局在關押期間反覆逼問她在國外接觸的人名，參與過的組織，甚至施用「老虎凳」等酷刑，並逼她服用不知名藥物，身心皆受到巨大創傷。
最令她感到恐怖的經歷，是親眼目睹獄友遭折磨至死。她說，在被關押的3個月內，親眼目睹同房的68名獄友中有9人受殘酷折磨而死，無法想像全國會有多少人死去。
9月23日，自由亞洲報導，一名流亡海外的新疆政府公務員喀衣夏.阿汗披露，她認識的一個小女孩在「集中營」內被強姦，從「集中營」釋放時帶着一個剛出生的嬰兒，這表明新疆「再教育中心」就是民族滅絕的集中營。
此外，中共政府還以惡毒的株連懲罰親屬的方式，試圖封住所有在海外的維吾爾人的嘴巴。一些維族活動人士在見到美國官員之後，其在新疆的親屬被帶走關押酷刑虐待甚至死亡。
美國國務卿蓬佩奧11月5日公開譴責中共，並提及多起相關案例。他強烈要求「北京停止對居住在中國境外維吾爾人的一切騷擾，並允許他們與家庭成員自由交流而不受任何影響。」
在此之前，蓬佩奧10月8日還宣布，對在新疆壓制維吾爾民族的中共政府官員和其家庭成員施行簽證限制。他警告，中共必須結束嚴厲的監視和鎮壓，釋放所有被任意拘留的人。

Xinjiang women’s street dance was taken away by police car. Foreign observers were deceived.

07 Nov 2019, 04:19

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The CCP’s large-scale persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang has been strongly condemned by the international community. Under the international pressure, the CCP was forced to allow some international observers to visit Xinjiang. However, some observers disclosed that the CCP hired extras to perform on the streets. After the foreign tourists left, these dancing Xinjiang women were taken away by police cars.
Budov, a Ph.D. student in language education at the University of Newcastle, UK, disclosed to Canada's ""Global Mail"" that she found strange things in Kashgar, Xinjiang. The Uighurs who danced on the streets, after the departure of foreign tourists, were taken by police cars. The group took it away.
Budov immediately realized that these dancing Uighur women were actually extras arranged by the Chinese Communist Party. The report said that a Uighur woman who had recently fled to the United Kingdom revealed that police and officials came to her house earlier this year and asked her old father to go to the mosque for prayer on a specific day, giving 20 yuan each time. There are 100 yuan a day.
She also revealed that some Uighurs trusted by the Chinese government, such as one of her friends who are Chinese teachers, have also been asked to play pedestrians on the streets, and must carry at least 50 questions to deal with foreign observers. Obviously, the CCP tried to get away with it and hired actors to deceive these foreign missions.
According to the ""Global Mail"", when some foreign inspectors arrived in Xinjiang, all the people on the street, including bus drivers, small vendors, tourists, taxi drivers, and believers who prayed in the temple, were all authorized by the authorities. The hired person acts temporarily, sometimes simply by the police.
Ms. Budov has visited Xinjiang for three times in the past 18 months. She found that the surveillance cameras on the street have disappeared a lot in recent times. There are fewer policemen armed in groups, and the checkpoints on the streets are obviously lax. a lot of.
In addition to the renovation of the streets of Xinjiang, the Chinese government has also dismantled the high walls and power grids of some concentration camps, invited foreign observers to visit, and then the detainees told about their so-called ""good life"" in the concentration camps.
However, the Canadian Albanian journalist Jazei found the problem. He directly said, ""All this is a performance."" The police in the concentration camp ""is simply deceiving us. They want us to export falsehood to the world newspaper.""
When Jessie asked the question of the detainees’ beliefs, they saw fear from their eyes and the pleading eyes of the police.
However, some foreign observers, especially those from the Middle East and Central Asian countries, still choose to believe in the official CCP statement.
In recent years, the Chinese government has illegally detained millions of Xinjiang Uighurs in the ""re-education camp,"" and the horror of the education camp has continued to be exposed. Mihrigul Tursaun, a 29-year-old Uighur woman, was taken to the infamous re-education camp in January 2018. She disclosed the horror of the re-education camp at a press conference held in Washington last year.
Mina recalled that she had lived abroad and could speak foreign languages. During her detention, the authorities repeatedly asked her the names of people she had contacted abroad, the organizations she participated in, and even tortured the tigers and forced her to take them. A drug, both physically and mentally, is greatly traumatized.
The most embarrassing experience for her was to witness the torture of the prisoners to death. She said that within three months of being detained, nine of the 68 prisoners who witnessed the same room were cruelly tortured and could not imagine how many people would die in the country.
On September 23, Free Asia reported that an exiled Xinjiang government civil servant, Kayxia Ahan, disclosed that a little girl she knew was raped in a ""concentration camp"" and released from a ""concentration camp"" with a newborn. The baby, this shows that the Xinjiang ""re-education center"" is the concentration camp for ethnic extermination.
In addition, the Chinese government has tried to seal the mouths of all Uighurs overseas, with vicious strains punishing relatives. After seeing US officials, some Uighur activists were taken away from their relatives in Xinjiang and tortured and tortured and even died.
US Secretary of State Pompeo publicly condemned the CCP on November 5 and mentioned a number of related cases. He strongly urged ""Beijing to stop all harassment of Uighurs living outside China and allow them to communicate freely with family members without any influence.""
Prior to this, Pompeo also announced on October 8 that he would impose visa restrictions on Chinese government officials and their family members who suppressed the Uighur nation in Xinjiang. He warned that the CCP must end severe surveillance and suppression and release all those who are arbitrarily detained.
