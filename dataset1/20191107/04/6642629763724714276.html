      <p>About 1,000 students, many wearing black masks, attended a graduation ceremony at the Chinese University of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a> on Thursday, with some holding up banners urging "Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now".</p>
      <p>The students defied a ban on masks that the government imposed last month in a bid to curb unrest that has rocked the Chinese-ruled city for more than five months.</p>

      <p>Dressed in formal graduation gowns, many of the students chanted as they walked from a metro station to the ceremony venue, calling for the government to respond to protesters' demands that include universal suffrage.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is we all remember five demands not one less, even though we are all exhausted, we should not give up," said Kelvin, a 22-year-old information engineering graduate.</p>
      <p>The protests started over a now-scrapped extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a> for trial but have evolved into calls for greater democracy and an independent inquiry into complaints of excessive force by police, among other demands.</p>
      <p>The months of sometimes violent anti-government protests have plunged the former British colony into its biggest crisis in decades, with no sign the demonstrators plan to give up.</p>
      <p>At the root of many protesters' indignation is what they see as Chinese meddling with Hong Kong's promised freedoms.</p>
      <p>China denies doing so and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble in the financial hub.</p>
      <p>The protests have hammered the city's economy, which is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/hong-kong-recession-2009-worse-feared-191031094714889.html">sliding into recession</a> for the first time since the global financial crisis in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Retail and tourism sectors have been hit particularly hard with visitor numbers plummeting as tourists stay away.</p>
      <p>Beijing supports bolder action to tackle the roots of unrest, a senior Chinese official said on Wednesday, citing social problems including unaffordable housing.</p>
      <p>More protests are planned on Thursday and through the weekend when bigger crowds usually gather.</p>
