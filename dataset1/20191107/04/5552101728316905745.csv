突遭資遣領失業救助金　昔日玉女歌手存款快見底
07 Nov 2019, 04:28 by 張詠淇
曾紅極一時的玉女歌手任潔玲，1991年出道，發行首張專輯《我就是愛你怎樣》，之後以一曲《我們有沒有愛過》紅遍歌壇。15年前轉型考進購物台當購物專家，沒想到3年前突然遭到資遣，一度靠月領2萬失業救助金過活。她最近曝光現況，坦言存款已經快要見底。
據悉任潔玲目前在吳建恆開的咖啡店幫忙，但是沒有支薪，學習策展辦活動，同時開工作室做代購，偶爾接綜藝節目通告，收入確實過不去，她表示，「我現在1個月開銷不多，但真的蠻緊的，我還要養媽媽，不過我還是有信心。」
任潔玲擔任購物專家從新手一路成為台柱，賣服飾、保養品，最忙時平均一天排到4個班以上，甚至喊到喉嚨長繭，被告知資遣後，她反而覺得是一種釋放。目前任潔玲一邊在吳建恆的咖啡店幫忙，一邊開工作室做代購，也學習幫做策展活動。但她態度樂觀，認為是上帝預備她進入下一個階段，直說還可以過，沒有到窮途潦倒的地步。

Zeng Hongji’s jade singer Ren Jieling, who debuted in 1991, released her debut album, “I Love You,” and then redeemed the song with a song, “Have I Loved It?” 15 years ago, when he was transferred to the shopping platform as a shopping expert, he did not expect to be suddenly dispatched three years ago. He once led a monthly 20,000 unemployment benefit. She recently revealed the current situation and admitted that the deposit is about to bottom out.
It is reported that Ren Jieling is currently helping in the coffee shop opened by Wu Jianheng, but there is no salary, learning the curatorial activities, while opening the studio to do the purchase, and occasionally receiving the variety show announcement, the income is indeed too late, she said, ""I am not spending one month now. More, but it's really tight, I have to raise my mother, but I still have confidence.""
Ren Jieling served as a shopping expert and became a pillar from the novice. She sold clothing and skin care products. On average, she was discharged to more than 4 classes a day, and even shouted to her throat. After being told that she was sent, she felt that she was released. At present, Ren Jieling is helping at Wu Jianheng's coffee shop, while opening a studio to do purchasing, and also learning to help curate activities. However, she is optimistic that God is preparing her to enter the next stage, and she can say that she can pass, and she has not reached the end of the road.
