07 Nov 2019, 04:32 by Jake Abbate
It’s been a few months since we’ve heard any casting news regarding Amazon Prime’s The Wheel of Time series. But now, the show’s producers have recruited a veteran of the fantasy genre to appear in the live-action translation of author Robert Jordan’s beloved novels. Michael McElhatton has just joined the upcoming series as Tam Al’Thor. McElhatton’s casting was confirmed via The Wheel of Time’s official Twitter account. You can check out the announcement for yourself below.



Previously, McElhatton starred in several episodes of Game of Thrones as Roose Bolton, father of Iwan Rheon’s Ramsay Bolton. He also appeared on National Geographic’s Genius, playing Philipp Lenard in season 1 and Jonas Salk in season 2. More recently, McElhatton guest starred in an episode of HBO’s Chernobyl and made recurring appearances on Amazon’s The Rook.

In the Wheel of Time universe, Tam Al’Thor is the adoptive father of Rand Al’Thor, who will be played by Josha Stradowski on the new series. Throughout the novels, Tam proves his mettle as a warrior by displaying an unparalleled marksmanship with a sword and bow. During his youth, he joined the Illian army and, many years later, trained Rand to improve his own combat skills.
So far, The Wheel of Time’s cast also includes Rosamund Pike (Moiraine), Marcus Rudda (Perrin Aybara), Zoë Robins (Nynaeve), and Barney Harris (Mat Cauthon). Back in September, the show’s Twitter account posted a video of the actors gathering for the first table read for the pilot episode. The series is still without a release date, but filming will presumably begin soon.
