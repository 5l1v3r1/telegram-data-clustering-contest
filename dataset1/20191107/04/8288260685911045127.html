      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion news | The Baggies go into this weekend's trip to Hull City on top of the Sky Bet Championship table after victory at Stoke</h2>

      <h3>PEREIRA PLANS</h3>
      <p>It seems Sporting Lisbon are making plans for life without midfielder <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/matheus-pereira">Matheus Pereira</a> .</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is spending the season on loan at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> from the Portuguese outfit, and has been in fine form.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-matheus-pereira-news-17209673">The Brazilian</a> has scored three goals and provided eight assists in 13 Sky Bet Championship appearances for the league leaders this season.</p>
      <p>Pereira clearly has a bright future ahead of him, but it appears his parent club are getting ready to part company with the playmaker.</p>
      <p>Reports in Portugal claim that Albion will trigger an option to buy Pereira on a permanent deal in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-grady-diangana-recall-17210226">January</a> , with Sporting expecting to use the funds to aid their own transfer business.</p>

      <h3>BILIC ADMISSION</h3>

      <p>West Brom boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/slaven-bilic">Slaven Bilic</a> has admitted he was not aware of the quality possessed by forward <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/hal-robson-kanu">Hal Robson-Kanu</a> .</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has had to settle for a bit-part role under the new Baggies manager so far this season, but has made an impact when called upon.</p>
      <p>In his nine Sky Bet Championship appearances so far, the Wales international has scored three goals – an impressive feat given that he’s only had 249 minutes on the pitch. That means he has been hitting the back of the net every 83 minutes.</p>

      <p>His last strike was Albion’s second goal in the 2-0 win over Stoke City on Monday night, which came from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>Bilic says he is now fully aware of Robson-Kanu’s abilities, but admits he wasn’t prior to becoming Baggies head coach.</p>

      <h3>DIANGANA CONCERN</h3>

      <p>West Ham are considering recalling forward <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/diangana-recall-loan-west-ham-16986626">Grady Diangana</a> during the January transfer window, according to media reports.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has impressed while on loan at West Bromwich Albion , bagging four goals and providing five assists already this season.</p>
      <p>His performances have certainly caught the eye at parent club, and <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11685/11855562/west-ham-consider-recalling-grady-diangana-from-west-brom-loan-in-january">Sky Sports</a> are now claiming Diangana could return to the London Stadium in the New Year due to a clause in his loan agreement with Albion.</p>
      <p>Hammers boss Manuel Pellegrini could look to recall Diangana as he looks to strengthen his attacking options for the second half of the season.</p>

      <p>West Bromwich Albion will resume their Sky Bet Championship campaign this weekend at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hull-city-west-brom-tactics-17209403">Hull City</a> .</p>
      <p>The Baggies go to the KCOM Stadium in fine form and in a healthy position in the league table.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic ’s side beat Stoke City 2-0 in their last outing to move to the top of the Championship, two points ahead of second-placed Preston North End.</p>
      <p>Hull have had a mixed start to life under new manager Grant McCann, but have picked up wins against Derby County, Nottingham Forest and Fulham in recent matches.</p>
      <p>In the build-up to the game, we spoke to <b>Jonty Colman</b> from <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/all-about/hull-city">Hull Live</a> to get the inside track on Albion’s next opponent.</p>

      <h3>LOOKING TO IMPRESS</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article16091876.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_JS179320476.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Conor Townsend</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion left-back Conor Townsend has never been more desperate to impress after finally breaking into the team.</p>
      <p>Opportunity has knocked for Townsend with Kieran Gibbs out injured and his replacement, rookie academy product Nathan Ferguson, serving a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-suspensions-hull-city-17172721">three-match suspension</a> .</p>
      <p>Their absence paved the way for Townsend’s first league start of the season in the win over Stoke on Monday night when Albion kept only their third clean sheet.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old has no intention of relinquishing his jersey - not with a trip to hometown club Hull, where he started his career as an eight-year-old, on the immediate horizon.</p>
