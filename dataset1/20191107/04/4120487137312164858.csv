工业部长阿古斯称 政府将扩大出口市场以促进制造业

07 Nov 2019, 04:48

【Tempo日报雅加达讯】工业部长阿古斯.古米旺(Agus Gumiwang)声称，我国制造业增长受到疲软的全球经济形势的压力，导致制成品的需求减少。他计划扩大出口市场，以鼓励该行业发展。阿古斯称，一些地区都有可能成为我国新的出口市场。“例如在非洲，中东，和亚太各国。”他说，政府正在通过可以与上述国家进行贸易的市场和产品进行研究来寻找合作商机。汽车产品，食品和饮料，以及各个行业都有增加出口的巨大机会。参加国际活动也能扩大我国产品出口市场。例如，我国是明年最大的制造业技术展览会，汉诺威工业博览会(Hannover Messe)的官方合作国。阿古斯说，除了刺激出口外，该活动也加强我国作为主要投资目的地之一的地位，并鼓励工业领域的合作。根据中央统计局(BPS)的数据，截至2019年第三季度，我国非石油和天然气出口目的国最大的是中国和美国，总值各为183.5亿美元和130亿美元。出口至中国占总出口的15.99%，而出口至美国达11.33%。然而该两国之间的贸易战却使我国难以继续向该国出售商品。除了需求的降低外，阿古斯认为，制造业的疲软亦由生产障碍所引发，从原材料和辅助材料的可用性，能源关税至物流成本。为了提高效率，他计划发展在我国各地区的工业区建设。他说，“政府在那里改善工业物流路径，无论是原材料供应或者是商品分配，从而使其变得更加可靠和有效。”截至2019年底，工业部定下指标在爪哇以外发展18个工业区。可获得的投资潜力为250兆盾，和吸收直接劳动力共90万人。经济统筹部秘书Susiwijono称，政府也需要建立有吸引力的投资环境，以便鼓励制造业。因为，尽管其他国家经历了疲软，我国的状况难以改善。我国制造业仍然依赖容易因技术和市场偏好变化而分散注意力的产品。

Industry Minister Argus said the government will expand its export market to promote manufacturing

07 Nov 2019, 04:48

[Tempo Daily Jakarta] Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang claims that China's manufacturing growth has been under pressure from the weak global economic situation, leading to a decline in demand for manufactured goods. He plans to expand the export market to encourage the development of the industry. Argus said that some regions are likely to become China's new export market. “For example, in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific countries.” He said the government is looking for business opportunities through research on markets and products that can trade with these countries. Automotive products, food and beverages, and various industries have huge opportunities to increase exports. Participating in international activities can also expand China's product export market. For example, China is the largest manufacturing technology exhibition next year, the official partner of Hannover Messe. Argus said that in addition to stimulating exports, the event also strengthens China's status as one of the main investment destinations and encourages cooperation in the industrial sector. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), as of the third quarter of 2019, China's non-oil and gas export destination countries were China and the United States, with a total value of US$18.35 billion and US$13 billion respectively. Exports to China accounted for 15.99% of total exports, while exports to the United States reached 11.33%. However, the trade war between the two countries has made it difficult for China to continue to sell goods to the country. In addition to the reduction in demand, Argus believes that manufacturing weakness is also caused by production barriers, from the availability of raw materials and auxiliary materials, energy tariffs to logistics costs. In order to improve efficiency, he plans to develop industrial zones in various regions of China. He said, ""The government is there to improve the industrial logistics path, whether it is the supply of raw materials or the distribution of goods, so that it becomes more reliable and effective."" By the end of 2019, the Ministry of Industry set the target to develop 18 industrial zones outside Java. The available investment potential is 250 trillion rupiah and a total of 900,000 people are absorbed from the direct labor force. Susiwijono, secretary of the Economic Planning Department, said the government also needs to establish an attractive investment environment to encourage manufacturing. Because, despite the weakness of other countries, the situation in our country is difficult to improve. China's manufacturing industry still relies on products that are easily distracted by changes in technology and market preferences.
