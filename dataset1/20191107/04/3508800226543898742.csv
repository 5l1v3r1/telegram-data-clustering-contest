我們想讓你知道的是杜特蒂的掃毒行動已奪走數千人性命，促使其政敵、副總統羅貝多呼籲國際干預，6日羅貝多接受杜特蒂的任命，擔負起領導菲國掃毒行動的角色，而她預期杜特蒂政府會試圖從中作梗，阻撓她取得進展。



（中央社）菲律賓副總統羅貝多6日接受主要政敵、總統杜特蒂的任命，擔負起領導菲國掃毒行動的角色。羅貝多也預期杜特蒂政府會試圖從中作梗，阻撓她取得進展。
路透社報導，菲律賓總統與副總統分別選舉產生，羅貝多（Leni Robredo）與杜特蒂（Rodrigo Duterte）呈對立關係。羅貝多日前接受路透社專訪及隨後在媒體上發表批評掃毒行動的言論，都惹怒了杜特蒂。
杜特蒂的血腥掃毒行動已奪走數千人性命，促使維權人士呼籲國際干預。羅貝多10月23日受訪也說死亡人數太多，同時表示若政府繼續容忍警方濫權，就應尋求國際協助。
在杜特蒂任命羅貝多擔任跨部會掃毒委員會共同主席之後，盟友紛紛警告羅貝多這是陷阱，目的是要讓她難堪、失敗。羅貝多也說她懷疑杜特蒂的動機，但仍願意把握機會。
羅貝多在記者會上表示：「我反對濫殺無辜，我反對官員濫用職權。他曉得我在批評什麼，還有我打算整頓什麼⋯⋯如果總統認為我接受任命就會閉嘴，那他就錯了。」
杜特蒂的支持者也敦促羅貝多接任，他們認為既然羅貝多批評那麼多，就應該把想法付諸實行。
前警察總長兼掃毒行動指揮官、現任參議員德拉羅沙（Ronald dela Rosa）就說羅貝多有機會令人印象深刻。德拉羅沙在電視上表示：「現在是她發光發熱的時候…我祈禱她成功。」
杜特蒂掃毒行動受到菲律賓民眾歡迎，今年9月一份民調顯示，82%受訪者認為掃毒行動富有成效。但批評人士說，掃毒行動未能遏制毒品成癮、毒品供應和限制毒梟。
維權人士還指控警方大規模處決嫌犯、掩蓋事實，政府卻不予理會。杜特蒂政府則宣稱，警員僅在自衛時才殺人。

羅貝多主張尋求國際協助反毒
中央社報導，杜特蒂進行的掃毒行動以致數以千計人遭殺害，而人權團體指稱那些遇害者遭有計畫處決並透過警方掩飾非法。副總統羅貝多曾於10月23日告訴路透社，杜特蒂的掃毒行動全面鎖定貧苦人，並默許警方濫用權力，菲律賓應尋求包括聯合國與國際刑事法院（ICC）等國際協助。
羅貝多和前總統艾奎諾三世（Benigno Aquino III）屬自由黨（LP），與杜特蒂為不同陣營，她認為已有太多人遭殺害，卻無跡象顯示販毒與吸毒情況減少。羅貝多在專訪中表示：「我們反躬自省：『為何這些狀況仍層出不窮？』總統已嚴厲警告販毒集團和毒梟…而這些狀況仍非常普遍，顯然根本未奏效。」
BBC報導，杜特蒂在2016年當選後，對持有非法毒品的人士展開了強硬運動，杜特蒂公開呼籲公眾殺死吸毒者和毒販，並表示將對殺害可疑毒品使用者和販毒者的警察給予懸賞。
根據菲律賓警方說法，反毒運動開始以來，至少有6600名經銷商或用戶被殺，不過社運人士則認為這一數字逼近2萬7000人。人權團體指稱，許多謀殺案屬於當場處決。
雖然聯合國和國際刑事法院正在審查有關法外處決、任意逮捕和強迫失踪的指控，但杜特蒂和他的反毒運動得到了菲律賓人的廣泛支持。

Deviated to Hushanxing, the Philippine Vice President accepted the overseed of the political enemy Dutti
07 Nov 2019, 04:26 by Key Commentary ASEAN:Philippines


What we want you to know is that Dutti’s anti-drug operation has claimed thousands of lives, prompting his political opponent and Vice President Roberto to call for international intervention. On the 6th, Roberto accepted Dutti’s appointment and took the lead in the Philippines. The role of the anti-drug operation, and she expects the Dutti government to try to stalk from it and obstruct her progress.



(Central News Agency) Vice President of the Philippines, Roberto, accepted the appointment of the main political enemy and President Dutti on the 6th and assumed the role of leading the anti-drug operation of the Philippines. Roberto also expects the Dutti government to try to stalk from it and obstruct her progress.
Reuters reported that the Philippine President and the Vice President were elected separately, and that Leni Robredo and Rodrigo Duterte were in opposition. Robedo’s recent interview with Reuters and subsequent comments in the media that he criticized the anti-drug campaign angered Dutti.
Dutti’s bloody anti-drug campaign has claimed thousands of lives and prompted activists to call for international intervention. Roberto’s interview on October 23 also said that there were too many deaths, and said that if the government continues to tolerate police abuses, it should seek international assistance.
After Dutti appointed Robedo as co-chair of the Inter-Ministerial Anti-Drug Committee, allies warned that Roberto was a trap to make her embarrassed and unsuccessful. Roberto also said that she doubted Dutti’s motives but was still willing to seize the opportunity.
Roberto said at the press conference: ""I am against indiscriminate killing. I oppose the abuse of power by officials. He knows what I am criticizing, and what am I going to rectify? If the president thinks that I will accept the appointment, he will shut up. Then he will wrong.""
Dutti’s supporters also urged Roberto to take over. They believe that since Roberto has criticized so much, he should put his ideas into practice.
Former police chief and anti-drug operations commander, current Senator Ronald dela Rosa said that Roberto had an opportunity to be impressive. De La Rosa said on television: ""Now is when she is glowing... I pray that she will succeed.""
Dutti’s anti-drug campaign was welcomed by the Filipinos. A poll in September showed that 82% of respondents thought the anti-drug campaign was fruitful. But critics say the anti-drug operation failed to curb drug addiction, drug supply and drug lords.
Activists also accused the police of massively executing suspects and covering up the facts, but the government ignored them. The Dutti government claimed that police officers only kill themselves when they defend themselves.

Roberto advocates seeking international assistance in anti-drug
The Central News Agency reported that Dutti’s anti-drug operations resulted in the killing of thousands of people, and human rights groups alleged that the victims were systematically executed and concealed by the police. Vice President Roberto told Reuters on October 23 that Dutti’s anti-drug operations fully targeted the poor and taunted the police’s abuse of power. The Philippines should seek international assistance, including the United Nations and the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Robedo and former President Benigno Aquino III belonged to the Liberal Party (LP) and were different from Dutti. She believed that too many people had been killed, but there was no indication that drug trafficking and drug abuse were reduced. In an interview, Roberto said: ""We are reflexive: ""Why are these conditions still emerging?"" The President has severely warned drug trafficking groups and drug lords... These conditions are still very common and apparently have not worked.""
The BBC reported that after being elected in 2016, Dutti launched a tough campaign against people possessing illegal drugs. Dutti publicly appealed to the public to kill drug users and drug dealers, and said that they would kill suspicious drug users and drug traffickers. The police gave a reward.
According to the Philippine police, at least 6,600 dealers or users have been killed since the beginning of the anti-drug campaign, but the social activists believe that this number is close to 27,000. Human rights groups alleged that many murders were executed on the spot.
Although the United Nations and the International Criminal Court are reviewing allegations of extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances, Dutti and his anti-drug campaign have received widespread support from Filipinos.
