      <p>WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Two men from Australia died this week following a climbing accident near the city of Queenstown in New Zealand’s South Island, New Zealand Police said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Brett Alexander Lentfer, 62, and James Harry Spaile, 44, died after they fell off a cliff about midday on Tuesday, the police said. Lentfer is an Australian resident while Spaile is an Australian, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The pair were climbing in an area of The Remarkables mountain range known as the Grand Traverse when they fell, the police said.</p>
      <p>The Grand Traverse is a steep alpine considered one of the best routes in the country for experienced climbers with previous mountaineering experience. It takes about eight to 10 hours to complete the traverse.</p>
      <p>“Our condolences are with the family and friends of both men,” police said in the statement.</p>
      <p>The pair were roped together, according to local media reports, and were climbing with a guide at the time.</p>
      <p>The body of one climber was found on Tuesday while the other man was recovered on Wednesday, the police said in earlier statements.</p>
