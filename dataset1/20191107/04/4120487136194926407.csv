【Tempo新闻网雅加达11月6讯】我国总统佐科威（Jokowi）周三（11月6日）由外交部长蕾特诺马尔苏迪(Retno LP Marsudi)和经济统筹部长艾尔朗卡．哈尔丹托(Airlangga Hartarto)陪同在雅京总统府接见到我国进行工作访问的美国商务部部长威尔伯稬罗斯(Wilbur燣.燫oss, Jr)，其中讨论议题是GSP议题。美国普遍优惠制（Generalized System of Preferences－GSP）简称普惠制，是发达国家对从发展中国家或地区进口的制成品和半制成品给予普遍的、非歧视的、非互惠的优惠关税的待遇制度。普惠制作为国际贸易的一种政策措施。蕾特诺外长在雅京总统府向传媒表达：“我国与美国针对这个问题已经讨论了很长时间，也许在12月初我们将派一个小组进行谈判以解决这个问题，并望能达成协议。”艾尔朗卡解释说，普惠制是印尼和美国之间合作的象征。因此政府希望美国谨慎评估普惠制政策，继续给予我国更优惠的待遇而不是终止对我国的普惠制的政策。艾尔朗卡补充说，实际上我国与美国的普惠制谈判几乎取得共识。希望在今年圣诞节之前双方都能达成协议。此前，美国扬言要撤销对印度尼西亚提供的124种产品的普惠制政策。 如果普惠制被撤销，印尼必须支付19.5亿美元的进口税。（v）
