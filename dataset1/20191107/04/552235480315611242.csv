One of the fundraising organisers is Taylor McGee, who had been friends with Denai since their primary school days.
Taylor told the Record of how Denai's death has rocked those left behind.
She said: ""We’re all trying to be strong but there’s definitely been a lot of tears.
""We feel Denai’s death has brought us all together again as a group and together we all want to do our part to make sure she is remembered in the best way possible.
""It’s come as a shock to us and still hasn’t quite sunk in that we won’t see our best friend again.""
Taylor said her friend was 'an amazing mum'.
She added: ""She would light up every room she went into.
""She was a kind, caring person who was always laughing.
""As soon as her son, Kalvin came into her life he was instantly her priority.
""He meant the world to her and brought her so much happiness.
""Denai was an amazing mum.
""She always put Kalvin first and he absolutely adored her.""

Taylor organised the online fundraiser alongside Andrea Murphy, Shannon Maitland, Megan Hollywood, Paige Wright, Amie McIntosh, Lauren Johnston, Shanna Menzies, and Kathleen Short who've all been showing their support.
So far over £800 has been raised.
On November 1 crowds gathered to show their support for Denai's loved ones at Dalmuir Park in Clydebank for a balloon release, fireworks and music.
A Facebook page, Remembering Denai McDougall, has been set up to allow people to pay their respects and keep followers up to fate with any future fundraising events.
Denai's devastated best friends, who've rallied together in the wake of her death, have paid tribute to their 'angel'.
