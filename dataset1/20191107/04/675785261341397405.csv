11 times The Queen wore fur before agreeing to ban it from her wardrobe
Her Majesty has sported fur on many occasions during her reign, however she has now ditched the controversial material

She may be 93 but the Queen has proved she’s not set in her ways by taking the modern decision to go fur-free.
After decades of real fur coats, Her Maj thrilled animal rights campaigners with the decision to switch to faux-fur in any new outfits, as we reported in yesterday’s Mirror.
Her official dresser Angela Kelly revealed the move in her memoir, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, and said mink trim had been removed from a favourite coat.
Buckingham Palace confirmed the news, though the monarch may still wear old fur on existing outfits including ceremonial robes.
Here, we look back at Liz’s fur fashions.
Coronation robes, 1953

The Queen won’t be able to trim the fur from historic regal robes as she has done with her personal coat.
Here, she stands with her six maids of honour and Mistress of the Robes at her coronation at Westminster Abbey in London on June 2, 1953.
The gown is embellished with a crimson velvet mantle edged with ermine. Not surprisingly, she needed a string of maids to help her take the strain.
