      <h1>DJI Mavic Mini in Malaysia: Everything you need to know</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 7 — Remember how not too long ago, everyone lost their minds with how small the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2016/09/28/djis-mavic-pro-is-a-full-featured-4k-drone-that-can-fit-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/">DJI Mavic Pro</a> was? I do because I was exactly one of those people who were mighty impressed.</p>
      <p>But we’ve come some ways since then and today, DJI is bringing a drone that truly has the footprint of a smartphone, and weighs about the same too, into Malaysia.</p>
      <p>This is the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/31/dji-mavic-mini-smallest-foldable-drone-skg/">DJI Mavic Mini</a> and here’s everything you need to know about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pricing &amp; availability</b>
      </p>
      <p>DJI’s Mavic Mini will retail for RM1,599 for the standard package and RM1,999 for Fly More Combo.</p>
      <p>The standard package includes the Mavic Mini, remote controller, one battery, extra propellers and its necessary tools and cables.</p>
      <p>For the Fly More Combo, you’re getting the same accessories with an additional 360-degree propeller cage, two-way charging hub, two additional batteries, three sets of extra propellers and a carrying case.</p>

      <p>The Mavic Mini is now available for pre-order and it will start shipping in mid-November 2019.</p>
      <p>The accessories will be available for pre-order at the end of this month.</p>
      <p>VSTECS Astar Sdn. Bhd. (formerly known as ECS Astar Sdn Bhd) is a DJI authorised distributor and they are also appointed as a DJI Recommended Service Centre for aftersales and repair services in Malaysia.</p>

        <b>DJI Mavic Mini features</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite being one of the smallest proper drones in the market right now, what sets the Mavic Mini apart is that it looks like quite the capable drone too.</p>
      <p>In DJI’s hierarchy, the Mavic Mini sits somewhere between the Mavic Air and the DJI Spark.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>However, because the drone’s wings actually fold in, the Mavic Mini actually has a smaller footprint than the DJI Spark, and weighing just 249g, the drone is also 51g lighter than the Spark too.</p>
      <p>Also, this weight sweet spot means the Mavic Mini doesn’t require registration with the FAA in the US.</p>
      <p>Despite its tiny size, the Mavic Mini still features a 3-axis gimbal that stabilises the drone’s 12MP f/2.8 ½.3-inch CMOS sensor.</p>
      <p>That said, it’s not quite the shooter the Mavic Air is because the Mini is only capable of shooting up to 2.7K resolution with a maximum bitrate of 40Mbps.</p>
      <p>Not great for pros/prosumers, but likely good enough for a casual user’s first drone.</p>
      <p>What is a little disappointing, however, is that the drone sacrifices a lot of the advanced collision avoidance systems DJI has built its name on.</p>
      <p>There are no front sensors, back sensors, nor side sensors. It only has a single downward sensor, which is honestly a little disappointing.</p>
      <p>What made flying DJI drones effortless even for beginners was how hard it actually was to crash one when you had all the sensors on. But, for a drone that seems designed for beginners, not having this is rather perplexing.</p>
      <p>&lt;&gt; </p>
      <p>That said, the rest of the drone is still pretty solid. You’ve got a killer (up to) 30 minutes of flight time, which is a huge improvement over the Spark’s comedic 16 minutes.</p>
      <p>Plus, it also has a max transmission range of 4km which is double that of the Spark.</p>
      <p>On top of that, it also supports a whole host of DJI’s smart QuickShots so you can perform dronies, rockets, circles and helixes with a couple of taps on the DJI app.</p>
      <p>Clearly, the Mavic Mini is still a very capable drone, and its minute size makes it a tantalising package for travel videographers. The question is, will this be the drone for you? — <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/07/dji-mavic-mini-malaysia-official-price-combo-skg/">SoyaCincau</a></p>
