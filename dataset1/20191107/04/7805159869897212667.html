      <h1>ASUS ROG Phone II update adds new AirTrigger gestures to simulate sliding on screen</h1>

      <p>Asus first <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-ii-specs-features-pricing-availability/">launched the ROG Phone II in China</a> back in July and the phone finally made its way to the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-ii-global-launch/">US and Indian markets</a> in September. The device offers top-of-the-line specifications at a competitive price, however, it’s not just the flagship hardware that makes it an awesome device. Asus has also improved its software offering, adding a ton of useful features while <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-ii-stock-android-ui/">dialing back on the gamery aesthetic</a>. With a recent update, the company added even more useful features, like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-ii-update-key-mapping-squeeze-shortcuts/">key mapping and squeeze shortcuts</a>, into the mix. And now, the smartphone is getting new AirTrigger gestures.</p>

      <p>If you’re familiar with the ROG Phone II, you’d already know that the device features something called AirTriggers on the right edge. These triggers aren’t exactly buttons, but ultrasonic pressure-sensitive regions in the device’s frame and they can be mapped to emulate a tap on the screen.</p>

      <p>The latest update for the ROG Phone II adds a new functionality which will essentially allow you to map a horizontal slide on the screen to one of the AirTriggers. This new feature could come in handy in a variety of games that require you to swipe horizontally on the screen to perform a specific function. For example, in Asphalt 9 Legends the horizontal slide to change lanes can now be mapped to the AirTriggers.</p>
