      <p>Despite the weather warnings and the heavy rainfall in Rajkot throughout Wednesday evening, the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/saurashtra">Saurashtra</a> Cricket Association is confident of putting up a successful show for the second of the three-match T20I series. According to sources in the board, Ganguly, who was supposed to be in Mumbai this week for a series of meetings at the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> headquarters as per the initial schedule, he has put the meetings on hold and will reach Rajkot on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>“Sourav is supposed to come. That’s what we have been informed. We are looking forward to welcoming him,” Saurashtra Cricket Association chief Jaydev Shah told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>“Eden Gardens is set to host the first-ever day-night Test match, a lot of work is left in Kolkata as well. So he might travel to Mumbai sometime next week,” one of the BCCI officials said.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh leads the Men in Blue 1-0 in the series courtesy a seven-wicket win at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.</p>
