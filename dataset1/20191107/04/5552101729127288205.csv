習近平對林鄭月娥高度信任？　學者斷言「下台命運無法改變」
07 Nov 2019, 04:23 by 吳妍, 鄒保祥
中國最高領導人習近平於本月4日在上海會晤香港特首林鄭月娥，席間表達對林鄭月娥與香港政府工作的高度肯定，讚許林鄭月娥「恪盡職守」，外界揣測此舉反映林鄭月娥是否地位更穩，但出身香港的政治觀察家林和立認為林鄭月娥下台的命運已無法改變。
林和立接受《德國之音》專訪時表示，林鄭月娥下台的命運已經不可能改變，無論是明年3月人大解除其職務，還是再讓她多留任一年。習近平在她卸任前表示支持，並不意味著中央對林鄭月娥工作的肯定，不然她將下台、中央尋覓適當人選取而代之的謠傳不會這麼多。
此外，林和立認為，中共四中全會公報和大法工委沈春耀的談話，都透露出北京往後任命和罷免香港特首與高階官員的機制須改進。林鄭月娥成為歷年來支持度最低的香港特首，許多觀察家指出，中央對她失去信心，林鄭儼然已成為中央的跛腳鴨，因此林和立提出，往後接替林鄭月娥的人選可能「更支持中央，也更具備政治手腕」，並預測香港今後的政策會變得更加強硬，全面控管將會更嚴。

Xi Jinping has a high trust in Lin Zhengyue? Scholars assert that ""the fate of stepping down cannot be changed.""
07 Nov 2019, 04:23 by Wu Hao, Zou Baoxiang
Chinese top leader Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai on the 4th of this month. He expressed his high affirmation of Lin Zhengyue's work with the Hong Kong government and praised Lin Zhengyue's ""due diligence"". It is speculated that this move reflects whether Lin Zhengyue is more stable. However, Lin Heli, a political observer from Hong Kong, believed that the fate of Lin Zhengyue’s stepping down could not be changed.
Lin Heli said in an exclusive interview with the ""Voice of Germany"" that the fate of Lin Zhengyue’s stepping down is no longer possible to change. Whether it is in March next year, the National People’s Congress will lift its position, or let her stay for another year. Xi Jinping’s support before she stepped down did not mean that the central government’s affirmation of Lin Zhengyue’s work would not be so much that she would step down and find the right person to choose.
In addition, Lin Heli believes that the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party and Shen Chunyao of the Dafa Working Committee have revealed that Beijing’s mechanism for appointing and dismissing Hong Kong chief executives and high-ranking officials should be improved. Lin Zhengyue became the Hong Kong Chief Executive with the lowest support in the past years. Many observers pointed out that the Central Committee lost confidence in her. Lin Zheng has become a lame duck of the Central Committee. Therefore, Lin Heli proposed that the candidate who succeeded Lin Zhengyue later may ""support the Central Government."" It is also more politically savvy, and it is predicted that Hong Kong's future policies will become more rigid and comprehensive control will be stricter.
