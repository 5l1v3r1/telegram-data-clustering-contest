      <p>Air Force officials also expressed condolences.</p>
      <p>“We share New Mexico’s grief over the tragic loss of Nahje Flowers and offer our deepest condolences,” Air Force athletic director Nathan Pine said in a statement, <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1387338/lobo-football-player-nahje-flower-dies.html?utm_source=abqjournal.com&amp;utm_medium=sidebar+-+post+list+-+north&amp;utm_campaign=post+list">according to the Journal</a>. “Air Force will now make the necessary steps to go along with Commissioner Craig Thompson and the Mountain West’s unprecedented decision to cancel this weekend’s game and reschedule. While Air Force has been disadvantaged by the decision, it pales in comparison to the loss New Mexico experienced.”</p>
