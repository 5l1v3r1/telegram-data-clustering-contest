      <p>Kibra residents in Nairobi County are today <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001347973/governors-join-raila-to-root-for-imran">voting in a showdown</a> pitting the Handshake/Kieleweke team against Deputy President William Ruto's team Tangatanga. <br/>The  Handshake team comprises politicians brought together following a unity pact between Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018. ODM - a subscriber of the handshake - has fielded Bernard Imran Okoth while Ruto’s Jubilee has ex-football sensation McDonald Mariga. The two are touted as the front runners based on the spirited campaigns that they have staged in the chase for the votes.</p>
