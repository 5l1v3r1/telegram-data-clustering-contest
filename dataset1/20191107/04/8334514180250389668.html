      <p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s experimental dengue vaccine was highly effective at preventing the mosquito-borne disease in a late stage study, but it failed to protect against one type of the virus in people with no prior exposure to dengue.</p>

      <p>Takeda’s vaccine was 80.2% effective at preventing dengue among children and teens in the year after they got the shot, according to results of a Phase III study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sanofi’s Dengvaxia - the world’s first dengue vaccine - had demonstrated 59.2% overall efficacy in the first year of follow-up based on combined results from two late-stage trials.</p>
      <p>There is an urgent need for an effective dengue vaccine. The tropical disease infects nearly 400 million people a year and kills up to 25,000 people.</p>
      <p>A preliminary analysis of Takeda’s vaccine suggests it may offer unbalanced protection among the four types of dengue. Experts have long been concerned that a dengue vaccine that is only partially protective could increase the risk of severe disease after exposure to a second type of the virus.</p>
      <p>The results follow Sanofi’s 2017 disclosure that Dengvaxia increased the risk of severe dengue in children who had no prior dengue exposure.</p>
      <p>That news triggered an investigation in the Philippines where 800,000 school-age children had already been vaccinated. Fallout from Sanofi’s vaccine has raised the bar for demonstrating the safety of future dengue vaccines.</p>
      <p>Among roughly a quarter of study subjects with no prior dengue exposure who got Takeda’s vaccine, the shot was 75% percent effective at preventing all four types of dengue.</p>
      <p>“This is a fantastic result and we’re thrilled,” Derek Wallace, who runs Takeda’s global dengue vaccine program, said in a phone interview, noting that the results were similar between those who have and have not had dengue before.</p>
      <p>Much of the vaccine’s overall benefit, however, appeared in people infected with dengue 2, the type of dengue that forms the basis of the vaccine known as TAK-003. It was 97.7% effective at preventing dengue 2, but lead researchers said the effect was “modest” against the other three types of the virus.</p>
      <p>There was no difference in effectiveness against dengue 2 among those with no prior exposure to dengue and those previously exposed, and a slightly lower benefit against dengue 1 for those with no prior exposure.</p>
      <p>But preliminary evidence suggests the vaccine failed to protect against dengue 3 in children and teens with no prior dengue exposure, and there was not enough evidence to make a call about its effect on dengue 4, researchers said.</p>
      <p>The results suggest “there may be an imbalance in the vaccine, particularly with dengue 3 and maybe dengue 4, but the efficacy was very good,” said Dr. Anna Durbin of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who helped develop a rival dengue vaccine with the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p>
      <p>Dr Stephen Thomas, a dengue expert at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University who has been a paid adviser for Takeda, Sanofi and several other drugmakers, said the results in dengue 3 “are disappointing from the perspective that the field desires a vaccine with protective efficacy.”</p>
      <p>However, Thomas said there is more data coming and more follow-up underway, and said there is currently “no indication that the vaccine is doing harm” in people previously exposed to dengue or not.</p>
      <p>Takeda said it plans to file for approval in countries with the biggest dengue burden, with the first submission expected in the second half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Takeda will release additional data at a medical conference later this month.</p>
