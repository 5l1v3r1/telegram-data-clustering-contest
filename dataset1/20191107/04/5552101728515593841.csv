三星電子在經歷Note7自燃事件後，2018年試圖重返中國手機市場，經過一年努力市占率仍徘徊在1%，今年9月三星關閉惠州最後一間手機工廠後。如今三星又遭人爆料，在中國的11間分公司及辦事處將合併成5大區，並裁員高達1/3左右，預估被裁掉的員工逾2,000人。
根據中國媒體《財新網》報導，三星集團於中國的子公司「三星電子」，在調整組織架構、關閉惠州手機工廠後，仍啟動大規模裁員，一位接近三星電子的人士爆料，該公司將原來11間分公司調整為5大區，手機業務成為這波裁員的重災區，依照推估影響逾2,000人。
近日更有多名三星電子員工透露，這次裁員賠償方案包含賠償金與年終獎金，有部分的員工還可獲得一支三星A系列或S系列的手機。
對於以上各種爆料，三星中國官方4日曾做出回應，並未直接否認裁員消息，反而強調此舉是為了提升在中國競爭力所作出的相關業務調整，以此推動在中國5G市場中的快速增長。以此聲明預估，三星近期可能還將有另一波人事上的調整。
