      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): The FBM KLCI seesawed in the morning session today, tracking regional markets frustrated by the lack of promising US-China trade talks.</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm, the FBM KLCI dipped 0.16 points to 1,603.09. The index had earlier risen to a high of 1,605.06.</p>
      <p>Gainers edged losers by 276 to 263, while 510 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 1.31 billion shares valued at RM698.57 million.</p>
      <p>Among decliners were Nestle (M) Bhd, Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, Public Bank Bhd, AirAsia Group Bhd and Yinson Holdings Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Velesto Energy Bhd, Karambunai Corp Bhd, FoundPac Group Bhd, Sanichi Technology Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd.</p>
      <p>The gainers included Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Teck Guan Perdana Bhd, MISC Bhd, Genting Plantations Bhd, UWC Bhd and Pharmaniaga Holdings Bhd.</p>
      <p>Asian shares managed to cling near multi-month peaks on Thursday, while bonds eked out a bounce as reports of delays in sealing a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal left investors frustrated at the lack of concrete progress, according to <i>Reuters.</i></p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased a slight 0.1%, just off a six-month high hit earlier in the week, it said.</p>
      <p>Affin Hwang Capital Research said the FBMKLCI Index turned slightly lower in yesterday’s session, down 3.49 points or 0.22%, closing at 1603.25.</p>
      <p>“The index moved lower towards a low of 1597.18 before paring some of the losses, closing back above 1600 at 1603.25.</p>
      <p>“On the daily chart, the EMA20d is also steadily converging towards the EMA50d, which is a positive signal as a successful cross above would prompt a further bullish outlook.</p>
      <p>“Technical relief rebound in progress,” it said.</p>
