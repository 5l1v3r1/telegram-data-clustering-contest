McDonald's Brings Back Classic Happy Meal Toys
07 Nov 2019, 04:30 by Mike Fahey



The McDonald’s Happy Meal has produced some pretty iconic crappy, french fry-scented bits of colourful plastic over the years. From November 21, Suprise Happy Meals will be packed with one of 17 classic toys from the past four decades, including Power Rangers, Tamagotchi, Furbies and more.
The good news is there are 17 iconic food toys in the special Surprise Happy Meals, including remakes of some of the most sought-after McDonald’s toy collectibles. I need the Dinosaur Happy Meal and hamburger transforming figures, and if I don’t come out of this special event with all three of the special McNugget figures, what’s the point of life?

Cowboy McNugget (McDonald’s): 1988
Fireman McNugget (McDonald’s): 1988
Mail Carrier McNugget (McDonald’s): 1988
Hamburger Changeable (McDonald’s): 1989
Grimace (McDonald’s): 1990
Dino Happy Meal Box Changeable (McDonald’s): 1991
McDonald’s Hot Wheels Thunderbird (Mattel): 1993
Hamburglar (McDonald’s): 1995
Power Rangers (Hasbro): 1995
Space Jam Bugs Bunny (Warner Brothers): 1996
Patti the Platypus (Ty Beanie Baby): 1997
101 Dalmatians – U.S. Exclusive (Disney): 1997
Tamagotchi (Bandai): 1998
My Little Pony (Hasbro): 1998
Furby (Hasbro): 1999
Sorcerer’s Apprentice Mickey – U.S. Exclusive (Disney): 2002
Hello Kitty (Sanrio): 2013

Editor's Note: This list comes from the U.S. but the promotion is being launched in Australia soon after, so we expect a similar range of toys here.
Thanks to my children’s insatiable appetite for chicken nuggets and my local McDonald’s jumping the gun, my family has already acquired the Furby and Power Ranger toys. That means we need to purchase at least 15 more Happy Meals to collect the whole set. Or wait a week and eBay the damn things.
