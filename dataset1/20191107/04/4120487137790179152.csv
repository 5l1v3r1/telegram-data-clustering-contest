【点滴新闻网勿加西11月06日讯】勿加西地方收支局（Bapenda）发出的民间社会组织信函引起了争议。因为勿加西市长拉赫马特（Rahmat Effendi）与民间社会组织合作经营停车收费。“现在，民间社会组织或其他机构在建设城市方面具有相同的利益。重要的是不要过于极端和暴徒的作风。我们必须使用规则。“拉赫马特周三（11月6日）在勿加西其办公室如是说道。然而，民间社会组织经营停车收费在社区引起了争议。到目前为止，拉赫马特声称没有更多计划在经营停车收费方面与民间社会组织合作。此前，内政部长狄托卡纳维安（Tito Karnavian）也呼吁不要以民间社会组织的名义进行停车收费管理。以免损害在印尼的投资者。“这项停车收费征收非常大，特别是在城市地区，并且是非法收费的来源之一，因此，当地政府没有获得可观的收入。不良的泊车管理显然对社区非常不利，特别是如果暴徒或以社区组织为幌子征收的，最有可能发生敲诈勒索。“内政部情报中心主任巴赫蒂尔（Bahtiar）周三（11月6日）的声明中如是说。狄托说，佐科威总统强调了投资对创造就业机会的重要性。狄托希望地方首长支持佐科威的愿景和使命。为了克服这一问题，狄托要求当地政府采取果断行动，保护民众免受非法征收捐税。“ 我们为保护民众必须消除勒索泊车行为和暴徒的团队，并对保护非法泊车管理的人采取行动。”巴赫蒂尔如是说。
