Youth football bosses have launched an investigation into a former match secretary who downloaded child abuse images.
Ryan Cullen, 25, held the position at Dunbartonshire Youth Football Development League. He was also involved in Clydebank Boys Club but left more than four years ago.

Police found the images after they raided Cullen’s home in Linvale, Clydebank, last November. Last month, he pled guilty to two charges relating to the creation and possession of indecent images of children between June 2015 and November 2018.
At Dumbarton Sheriff Court last week, he was spared jail. Cullen was ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work and was put on the sex offenders’ register for three years.
The Scottish Youth Football Association, which suspended Cullen in January following notification from Disclosure Scotland of the allegations, said it had launched an investigation.
 
A spokesman added: “Having spoken to the current and former league secretaries, they’ve confirmed that no concerns were raised with them about Cullen’s behaviour or actions relating to his former position at the league.”
