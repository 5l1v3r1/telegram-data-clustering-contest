      <p>It’s been a few months since we’ve heard any casting news regarding Amazon Prime’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-wheel-of-time"><b>The Wheel of Time</b></a> series. But now, the show’s producers have recruited a veteran of the fantasy genre to appear in the live-action translation of author Robert Jordan’s beloved novels. Michael McElhatton has just joined the upcoming series as Tam Al’Thor. McElhatton’s casting was confirmed via <b>The Wheel of Time</b>’s official <a href="https://twitter.com/WoTonPrime/status/1192124485022863361">Twitter</a> account. You can check out the announcement for yourself below.</p>

      <p>Previously, McElhatton starred in several episodes of <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><b>Game of Thrones</b></a> as Roose Bolton, father of Iwan Rheon’s Ramsay Bolton. He also appeared on National Geographic’s <b>Genius</b>, playing Philipp Lenard in season 1 and Jonas Salk in season 2.

      <p>In the<b> Wheel of Time</b> universe, Tam Al’Thor is the adoptive father of Rand Al’Thor, who will be played by Josha Stradowski on the new series. Throughout the novels, Tam proves his mettle as a warrior by displaying an unparalleled marksmanship with a sword and bow. During his youth, he joined the Illian army and, many years later, trained Rand to improve his own combat skills.</p>
      <p>So far, <b>The Wheel of Time</b>’s cast also includes Rosamund Pike (Moiraine), Marcus Rudda (Perrin Aybara), Zoë Robins (Nynaeve), and Barney Harris (Mat Cauthon). Back in September, the show’s Twitter account posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/WoTonPrime/status/1179425813327798273">video</a> of the actors gathering for the first table read for the pilot episode. The series is still without a release date, but filming will presumably begin soon.</p>
