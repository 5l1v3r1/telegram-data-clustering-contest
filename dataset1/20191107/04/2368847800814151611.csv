07 Nov 2019, 04:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】西班牙歐羅巴航空一架班機的機長6日晚間誤傳警報，導致荷蘭阿姆斯特丹的史基普機場啟動安全措施實施封鎖，期間媒體也一度傳出疑似發生劫機事件。所幸只是機長「搞烏龍」，所有乘客與機組員均已安全下機。
荷蘭憲兵稍早表示，正在調查史基普機場一架飛機上的「可疑情況」。英國和荷蘭媒體傳出報導說，疑似有持刀男子意圖劫持班機。
歐羅巴航空（Air Europa）隨後發布聲明說：「今晚由阿姆斯特丹飛往馬德里的一班飛機誤傳警報，導致機場採取安全措施。沒有理由恐慌，所有乘客都很好，正在等待班機起飛。」
聲明再一次強調：「我們很抱歉，沒有理由恐慌。」
史基普機場（Schiphol）是歐洲第3忙碌的機場，僅次於倫敦的希斯羅機場（Heathrow）和巴黎的戴高樂機場（Charles de Gaulle Airport）。
