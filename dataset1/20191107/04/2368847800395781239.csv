拒色與貪色的果報（4）

07 Nov 2019, 04:36

（接上文）
古語云「做事須循天理」、「欲廣福田，須憑心地」，指人做事要按天理而行；要使自己的福運廣大，就要修自己這顆心。古人認為，行善以積德為上，積德又以護生及不淫為上。

（四）貪色自毀

明世宗嘉靖年間，陸簣齋之子陸仲錫，幼年時就能詩能文，天資穎異，凡看過的書很快就朗朗上口。陸仲錫十七歲那年，跟隨塾師邱某住在京城準備考試，常窺視寓所對面的女孩子，這位老師不但不加以制止勸告學生非禮勿視，應端正行誼，專心一志於學問，反而告訴陸仲錫說：「宣武門外的都城隍廟很靈，有求必應，為何不禱告遂願？」陸仲錫聽了老師的話因而前往。
當天晚上陸仲錫回來就做夢，並痛哭不止，眾人驚駭問原因，他說：「剛才我夢見都城隍在追趕我和老師，而且很嚴厲的斥責我，然後又叫神查我兩人祿位，我名字下注甲戌狀元，而老師名字下是一片空白，甚麼功名也沒有。都城隍說將立即向天帝稟奏，我們師生二人居心不正，不思本份，盡作非想，立即削除我的狀元祿位及功名，老師名下本來既空無所有，當絕其陽壽以懲罰為師無德、誤人子弟，以彰顯果報的昭然。」說完，仍哭泣不止。
一會兒，就見書僮急急忙忙跑來告訴說：「剛才接到邱老師死於急性霍亂的消息。」後來陸仲錫果然也應了夢境的預言，屢試不中，貧窮潦倒以終。
陸仲錫年少即有才華，理應登科及第，因心術不正而毀於一旦，可見得失全憑心地！擇師訓子，最宜詳慎，邱陸師生，其鑑不遠。敗名喪節之事，普通人也不敢膽大妄為，何況以身作則、每天以禮義教育學生的先生呢？一旦為惡，敗壞了讀書人名聲，要知道神明不佑為惡者，若犯了古訓中「指天地以證鄙懷，引神明而鑑猥事」的行為，則是污辱神格，罪過不淺，不但得不到神明的護佑，反將罪上加罪，自招惡報。神明只對清淨存心，積善積德的人賜福。

Rejection and greed (4)

07 Nov 2019, 04:36

(continued above)
In the old saying, ""doing things through the heavens"" and ""shelving the Futian, you must rely on the heart"" means that people should do things according to the principles of heaven; to make their own good fortune, they must cultivate their own hearts. The ancients believed that the good deeds were based on the virtues, and the virtues were based on nursing and non-obscenity.

(4) greedy self-destruction

During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Lu Zhongxi, the son of Lu Yizhai, was able to write poetry and literary talents in his childhood, and the books he had read quickly became catchy. When Lu Zhongxi was seventeen years old, he followed Qiu, a teacher, to live in the capital to prepare for the exam. He often peeked at the girl opposite the apartment. The teacher not only refused to stop the students from admonishing, but should be righteous and devoted to learning. Lu Zhongxi said: ""The Ducheng Temple outside Xuanwumen is very spiritual and responsive. Why don't you pray?"" Lu Zhongxi listened to the teacher's words and went.
In the evening, Lu Zhongxi was dreaming and crying. The people were shocked and asked why. ""I just dreamed that the capital was chasing me and the teacher, and I was very harsh and reprimanded me. Then I asked God to check my two, my name. The bet is the champion, and the teacher’s name is blank, and there is no name. Ducheng said that he will immediately play to the Emperor. Our teachers and students are not right, do not think about it, do nothing, and immediately remove me. The title of the champion and the name of the singer, the teacher’s name is nothing but empty. When the singer is squandered, he is punished as a teacher and a sinister, to show the fruit of the newspaper.” After that, he still cries.
After a while, I saw the book boy rushing to tell: ""I just received the news that Qiu died of acute cholera."" Later, Lu Zhongxi also responded to the dream of dreams, tried repeatedly, and ended up in poverty.
Lu Zhongxi is talented when he is young, and he should be degraded and ruined. Choosing a teacher's training, the most appropriate and careful, Qiu Lu teacher and student, its insight is not far. The ordinary people do not dare to be timid, but what about setting an example to educate the students every day with courtesy? Once it is evil, it corrupts the reputation of the readers. If you know that the gods are not sinful, if you commit the act of ""referring to the heavens and the earth to prove your feelings and ignoring the gods and ignoring things"", you will insult the gods and sin. Not only can you not be blessed by the gods, but you will add sin to your sins and sin. The gods only bless those who are pure and deliberate, and who accumulate good and good.
