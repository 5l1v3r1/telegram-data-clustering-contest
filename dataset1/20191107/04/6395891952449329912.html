      <p><b>KENT, Ohio (AP)</b> - Anthony Roberts scored a career-high 18 points and teammate Kalin Bennett, the first player diagnosed with autism to receive a Division I basketball scholarship, made his debut as Kent State defeated Division III opponent Hiram 97-58 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Bennett, a 6-foot-11, 300-pound freshman from Little Rock, Arkansas, entered with game in the final six minutes and scored his first collegiate basket with 2½ minutes left on a left-handed hook in the paint. He finished 1 of 3 from the floor with two rebounds and a block.</p>
      <p>After the game, teammates led Bennett over to the victory bell, which he rang.</p>
      <p>"For my mom to see it was really big for me," Bennett said. "To let her know that everything you've done has not been in vain."</p>
      <p>Asked about his impact on other young people with autism he said, "It's good to know that people look up to me but the real thing is: Everybody is capable of doing whatever they want to do in life. I hope I created a thing that's going to transcend to more kids so they believe in themselves first and foremost."</p>
      <p>Bennett covered a smile with a hand when coach Rob Senderoff mentioned that he didn't want to see him putting up ill-advised jumps shots, as he did once against Hiram.</p>
      <p>"I told him the jump shot has to go if he wants to play meaningful minutes," Senderoff said. "But I'm happy for him and proud of him."</p>
      <p>Bennett looks forward to improving his game.</p>
      <p>"Coach has been pushing to me and pushing me to be better than I am the day before," Bennett said. "That's why I want to achieve and show consistent improvement."</p>
      <p>Antonio Williams and Troy Simons added 17 points each for the Golden Flashes and Danny Pippen had 11 points and 11 rebounds. Kent State made 13 of 35 3-pointers, including 7 of 16 in the second half.</p>
      <p>Dean Sherman III led the Terriers with 19 points.</p>
