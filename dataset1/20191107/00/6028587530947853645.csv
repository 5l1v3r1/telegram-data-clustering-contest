(Updated: 11/12/19 at 10:04 a.m. PST)Topline: Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed paperwork on Tuesday to appear on the 2020 presidential primary ballot in Arkansas, taking the first steps in a bid to become a centrist alternative to progressives Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Bloomberg filed to appear on the primary ballot in Alabama last week and Tuesday flew down to Arkansas himself to file paperwork there. Both states have early filing deadlines, although he hasn’t made a final decision on whether to officially run yet. 
Bloomberg had been weighing a run for the past year, but ultimately decided against it after former vice president Joe Biden entered the race.
But as Warren and Sanders vault ahead in the polls, Bloomberg has told advisers he is concerned the current crop of candidates aren’t well positioned to beat Trump.

Key background: Michael Bloomberg cofounded financial information and media company Bloomberg LP in 1981. He put in the seed funding for the company and now owns 88% of the business, which has estimated revenues of $10 billion. According to Forbes, Bloomberg’s net worth is $52 billion.
Tangent: Bloomberg isn’t the only one considering a last-ditch presidential run as moderate Democrats in the party worry about their chances in a general election if a more liberal candidate gets the nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick is also exploring a presidential bid, believing that he would be able to unite the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic party.
