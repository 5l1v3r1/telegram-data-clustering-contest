      <p>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - The Illinois Appellate Court says it won’t immediately rule on a lower court decision that allows <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-public-schools/">Chicago Public Schools</a> cross-country runners to compete at the state championship meet Saturday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">Illinois High School Association</a> is seeking to overturn an order allowing the runners to compete in the postseason. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">IHSA</a> blocked their participation because a teachers’ strike prevented their attendance at the regional meet.</p>
      <p>The three-judge panel said Thursday it will rule on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">IHSA</a> appeal, but not before the meet in Peoria. A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">IHSA</a> did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.</p>

Cook County Judge Neil Cohen last week called that an arbitrary distinction in ruling CPS runners could compete in sectionals.</p>
