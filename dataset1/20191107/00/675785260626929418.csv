The word “non-binary” has been recognised by Collins dictionary for the first time.
The respected online edition also named “climate strike” as its word of the year for 2019.
It follows pop star Sam Smith coming out as non-binary and 16-year-old Greta Thunberg launching a global environmental movement.
Bosses said “non-binary” was now part of the English lexicon and it recognised “changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves”.
A person who identifies as non-binary does not define themselves exclusively as masculine or feminine. They often prefer they/them pronouns, rather than he/she.

Collins’ definition reads, “relating to a gender or sexual identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female, heterosexual or homosexual”.
Smith was among the first celebrities to ask the public to refer to them using they/them.
Laura Russell, of LGBT charity Stonewall, said: “It’s great that Collins will officially be adding non-binary to their dictionary.
“It’s important more organisations and people use language that includes everyone and recognises who they are.”
Climate strikes are part of a growing movement sparked by Thunberg’s school strikes outside the Swedish parliament.
