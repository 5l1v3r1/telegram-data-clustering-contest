      <p>SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cedar-fair-entertainment/">Cedar Fair Entertainment</a> says its amusement and water parks have seen another jump in attendance this year.</p>
      <p>The Sandusky, Ohio-based company says helping drive the increase are its popular Halloween and winter events along with new nighttime festivals at some of its parks.</p>
      <p>Attendance is up 4% overall this year at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cedar-fair-entertainment/">Cedar Fair</a>’s 11 amusement parks and five water parks across the U.S.</p>
      <p>The company said Wednesday that season pass sales for next year are up 50% compared with a year ago.</p>
      <p>Much of that is linked to a new discounted pass at the company’s flagship park, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cedar-fair-entertainment/">Cedar</a> Point, in Sandusky.</p>
