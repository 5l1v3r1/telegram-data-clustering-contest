      <h1>Impeachment 'much more of a danger' to Democrats than Republicans, Marc Thiessen says</h1>

      <p>Democrats are in more electoral danger than Republicans the longer the <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/admin-ajax-2019-11-06T194411.805a.jpg">Trump impeachment inquiry</a> wears on, according to former George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> opponents in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a> have yet to prove a quid pro quo, let alone an impeachable offense, Thiessen claimed Wednesday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Special Report</a>."</p>
      <p>"This whole quid pro quo is far from proven and there's a lot of evidence to push back against it," he said. "I think the Democrats are in a very bad political position. This is much more of a danger to them than it is the Republicans."</p>

      <p>Thiessen said that in 2018, 31 Democrats were elected in House districts won by Trump in 2016. Those Democrats campaigned, as he put it, "on kitchen table issues."</p>
      <p>"And the Democrats are focused entirely on impeachment -- doing nothing on health care, nothing on prescription drugs, nothing on infrastructure, nothing on USMCA," he added.</p>
      <p>"They could lose the House over this."</p>
      <p>In order to prevent that fate, Thiessen suggested Democrats drop their impeachment drive and instead push for a formal censure of Trump.</p>
      <p>In a censure scenario, he said, Republicans would be put on the defensive because they would have to prove the president did nothing wrong to warrant that action -- while with impeachment, they'd only have to prove none of Trump's actions rose to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors."</p>

      <p>Thiessen predicted any censure motion would pass with bipartisan support. By contrast, the recent resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry passed the House with no Republicans voting for it.</p>
