Juul Kills Popular Mint Pod Flavor In Latest Setback

(Updated: 3:23 p.m. EST, 11/7/2019)Topline: Juul stopped sales of its mint nicotine pods Thursday after a National Youth Tobacco survey showed the number of high school students vaping has grown to one in four, while a separate study indicated mint was the number one flavor for that age group.

“These results are unacceptable and that is why we must reset the vapor category in the U.S. and earn the trust of society,” said chief executive K.C. Crosthwaite in a press release. 
The mint pods make up 70% of Juul’s U.S. sales, according to CNBC, and while they’ll be withdrawn, Juul’s classic tobacco, Virginia tobacco and menthol pods will remain on the market.
Other studies published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found mint was the most popular flavor among high school students.
Pulling the mint pods from store shelves followed a week after a former Juul SVP filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the company, with the additional claim that it refused to recall one million contaminated pods. 
The lawsuit also alleges that after Juul stopped selling its fruit and candy-flavored pods, it “did nothing more than to increase the demand for mint-flavored pods.” 
The Trump administration is separately expected to announce a policy on e-cigarettes exempting menthol and tobacco flavors from any ban, but it’s unclear when that will take place.

Big number: Altria said Thursday it’s taking a $4.5 billion write down on its investment in Juul. It invested $12.8 billion in Juul for a 35% stake in 2018.
Key background: Juul has been caught in the middle of public health scares over vaping. Over 2,000 people have been sickened with vaping-related illness, while nearly 40 people have died from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  A number of the cases have been linked with vaping THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Several states, including New York, Michigan, Oregon and Massachusetts have banned e-cigarettes flavors, including those popularized by Juul, to tackle surging use by teenagers and nicotine addiction.
Tangent: Juul said October 28 it would cut 500 jobs by the end of the year, considered by executives as a “necessary reset” following the onslaught of regulatory and legal challenges it faces.
