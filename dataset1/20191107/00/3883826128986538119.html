        <b>Brazilian forward Rodrygo announced himself on club football's biggest stage with a 'perfect' hat-trick in Real Madrid's 6-0 defeat of Galatasaray.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 18-year-old became the second youngest player to score a Champions League treble, behind only Real legend Raul.</p>
      <p>He has already been labelled the <a href="http://globoesporte.globo.com/ce/futebol/times/ceara/noticia/2013/02/filho-de-eric-se-destaca-na-base-do-santos-e-e-chamado-de-neymarzinho.html">"new Neymar",</a> having followed in the Paris St-Germain star's footsteps by moving from Brazilian club Santos to Spain.</p>
      <p>Outside of South America, little was known about the 5ft 9in youngster - who is the the same height as Neymar - before his summer switch to Real.</p>
      <p>Since then, Rodrygo has scored five times in his first six appearances for the club in all competitions.</p>
      <p>"Hearing the Bernabeu singing my name is a dream come true," Rodrygo said. "I'm so happy, it has been a joyous night but I must try and stay calm."</p>

      <p>The Bernabeu were saluting the teenager as early as the fourth minute when he clinically opened the scoring, left-footed, from his fellow countryman Marcelo's pass.</p>
      <p>He got his second three minutes later as he headed in superbly from another Marcelo cross, becoming the first player to score twice in the first seven minutes of a Champions League game.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He was denied the chance of a quickfire hat-trick shortly afterwards, when captain Sergio Ramos stepped up to score a penalty after Steven Nzonzi had fouled Toni Kroos.</p>
      <p>But Rodrygo provided an assist for Benzema on the stroke of half-time and the Frenchman returned the favour in second-half stoppage time.</p>
      <p>The teenager - whose full name is Rodrygo Silva de Goes - completed his 'perfect' hat-trick as he poked in with his right foot to cap a crushing 6-0 win.</p>
      <h4>Rodrygo 'learns very fast' - Zidane</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>"He doesn't surprise me," said Real boss Zinedine Zidane. "He has a bit of everything.</p>
      <p>"He is intelligent, he learns very fast and wants to learn and improve.</p>
      <p>"Physically he has to get better but technically, he knows how to do everything with the ball."</p>
      <p>Benzema added: "Rodrygo is only 18 years old but he is fearless. I love to see a young footballer play this way."</p>
      <p>Wayne Rooney - also then 18 - was older than Rodyrgo when he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3677174.stm">scored a Champions League hat-trick</a> on his Manchester United debut against another Turkish side, Fenerbahce, in 2004.</p>

      <h4>Benzema's record-equalling 15-year streak</h4>
      <p>Benzema's brace saw him score in a 15th consecutive Champions League campaign, becoming only the second player - after Barcelona's Lionel Messi - to achieve the feat.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old French striker's first Champions League goal came at the age of 17, when he scored for Lyon against Rosenborg on 6 December, 2005.</p>
      <p>That was his only goal of that European campaign, and he netted just once in Europe the following term too and just once in 2009-10, after his £25m move to Real in 2009.</p>
      <p>In his 15 Champions League seasons he has scored 62 times, averaging more than four a season.</p>
      <p>He has never been the top scorer in a Champions League season, but is fourth on the competition's all-time goalscoring list, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Raul.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman scored against Liverpool in the final in 2018 and helped his side win four European titles between that year and 2014.</p>
      <p>Messi became the first player to score in 15 straight Champions League seasons just two weeks before Benzema.</p>
      <p>The Argentine set the record in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49874450">narrow win at Slavia Prague</a> on 23 October.</p>
