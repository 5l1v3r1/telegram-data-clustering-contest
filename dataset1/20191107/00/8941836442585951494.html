      <p>LEWISTON, N.Y. (AP) - Niagara has removed the interim tag and named <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-paulus/">Greg Paulus</a> the head coach of the men’s basketball team.</p>
      <p>The promotion was announced Thursday, two weeks after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-paulus/">Paulus</a> was elevated from assistant to interim coach after Patrick Beilein suddenly resigned for personal reasons.</p>
      <p>Beilein was hired by Niagara in March and added <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-paulus/">Paulus</a> to his staff as an assistant and recruiting coordinator in May. It’s the first head coaching job for the former Duke point guard.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-paulus/">Paulus</a> makes his debut Friday, when the Purple Eagles open their season at Drexel.</p>
      <p>He takes over a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference program that went 64-129 and failed to advance past the MAAC Tournament quarterfinals in six seasons under Chris Casey.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-paulus/">Paulus</a> was a three-year starter and two-time captain at Duke from 2005-09. He spent last year as an assistant at George Washington. He’s also worked at Louisville, Ohio State and Navy.</p>
