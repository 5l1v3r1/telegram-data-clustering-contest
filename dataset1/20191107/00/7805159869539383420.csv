Late last month, OnePlus rolled out OxygenOS 10.0.4 for the OnePlus 7T series. Among the usual bug fixes and improvements, the update included a new cloud service feature in the Gallery app, exclusively for Indian users. Now, OnePlus is pushing another update for the OnePlus 7T with some minor tweaks and the Android security patch for October 2019.

As per a recent post on the OnePlus forums, OxygenOS version 10.0.5 is now rolling out for the OnePlus 7T. The update doesn’t pack any significant changes, however, it does address an issue some users were facing with the double-tap to wake gesture on the device. Here’s the official changelog for the OxygenOS 10.0.5 update on the OnePlus 7T:


System

Fixed the double-tap gesture for screen activation
