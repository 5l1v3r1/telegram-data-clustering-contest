      <p>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A North Carolina teacher accused of storing a student’s gun in her classroom has now been indicted on a related charge.</p>
      <p>The Winston-Salem Journal reports 25-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-melissa-wilson/">Sarah Melissa Wilson</a> was indicted Monday on a charge of helping a minor possess a firearm on educational property. The indictment says the language arts teacher kept a 14-year-old’s .25-caliber handgun in her Paisley Magnet School classroom sometime between April and May. City police say she also allowed the student to pick up the gun at the end of the school day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-melissa-wilson/">Wilson</a> was arrested in May after a school resource officer learned about the gun and found it in the possession of another student. She was suspended with pay and fired the next month. She’s set to appear in court on Dec. 12.</p>
