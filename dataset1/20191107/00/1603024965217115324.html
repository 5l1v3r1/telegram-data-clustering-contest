      <p>The government wants e-commerce companies to provide details of how they can work with kirana stores to give them a boost, The Economic Times <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/government-wants-ecommerce-companies-to-make-kiranas-part-of-their-growth-story/articleshow/71947663.cms?utm_source=ETTopNews&amp;utm_medium=HP&amp;utm_campaign=TN&amp;utm_content=23">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has written to Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, Zomato, Swiggy and Big Basket, and other e-commerce firms asking how they can help kirana stores grow.</p>

      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.</p>
      <p>Flipkart, Amazon, Zomato, Swiggy and Big Basket did not respond to ET's queries.</p>
      <p>Commerce minister Piyush Goyal and Amazon India head Amit Agarwal discussed the subject when they met on November 5, the report added.</p>
      <p>Goyal has asked Amazon to work with the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) lobby group and requested details of Amazon India’s top sellers and tax-related information.</p>
      <p>"There were usual discussions about investments but the government is keen that Amazon does more for the unorganised retailers," a source told the publication.</p>
      <p>The government also wants more clarity on Amazon’s accounting standards and the investments it has lined up.</p>
      <p>CAIT recently alleged that predatory pricing, deep discounting by Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart during the festive season sales violates foreign direct investment (FDI) policy.</p>
      <p>The government wants to address these concerns of the unorganised retail sector and find a solution that benefits both parties, it added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
