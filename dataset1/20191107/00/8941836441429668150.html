      <h1>Australian whistleblower to represent himself at trial</h1>

      <p>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - An Australian army whistleblower charged with leaking secret documents alleging misconduct in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> said on Thursday he would defend himself at trial next year rather than face potential delays by hiring a lawyer with a security clearance.</p>
      <p>David William McBride, 55, appeared briefly in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court on charges relating to the leaking of classified documents about Australian Special Air Service involvement in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> to Australian Broadcasting Corp. reporters.</p>
      <p>Registrar Annie Glover continued McBride’s bail until he appears in court next on Monday for a trial date to be set in March or April.</p>
      <p>Glover also said the ABC’s application to keep McBride’s trial open to the public and media would be back in court on Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>McBride, a former military lawyer, said outside court that while he had been offered legal aid, he had decided to represent himself.</p>

      <p>“The government said you can only have a lawyer who has a top secret security clearance and we will decide who gets a top secret security clearance,” McBride told reporters.</p>
      <p>“So it gave them the ability to stretch the trial out for two years after they reviewed the person and then saying at the end of the two years, disingenuously: ‘Oh well, the person didn’t pass. You’re back to the drawing board,’” McBride said.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to put myself especially in the Department of Defense’s hands because I don’t trust them,” he added.</p>
      <p>McBride said he intended to call as witnesses Attorney-General Christian Porter, Governor General David Hurley, who is also a former chief of defense, as well as another former chief of defense, a former defense department secretary and a former defense minister.</p>

        <p>He admits to leaking documents that formed part of the basis of an ABC investigation broadcast in 2017 about Australian special forces in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a>. The ABC reported growing unease in the Australian Defense Force leadership about the culture of special forces and that Australian troops had killed unarmed men and children in 2013.</p>
        <p>The leak was the target of a police raid on ABC headquarters in Sydney in June. Police raided the Canberra home of a News Corp. Australia reporter a day earlier in search for unrelated classified documents. The raids were condemned as media intimidation and sparked criticism of an increasing culture of secrecy in Australian institutions.</p>
        <p>The Australian Defense Force Inspector-General, an independent office that monitors military justice, is examining allegations that elite Australian troops committed war crimes in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> from 2006 and 2014.</p>
