      <p><b>Topline: </b>Bill Gates became the latest among a slew of billionaires to express skepticism over Senator Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax on Wednesday, sparking a twitter conversation between the two, in which Warren invited the world’s second-richest man to meet in person.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speaking at the <i>New York Times’</i> DealBook Conference <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/bill-gates-elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax.html">Wednesday</a>, Bill Gates is the most recent billionaire to criticize Warren’s proposed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/elizabeth-warren-would-double-billionaire-wealth-tax-for-medicare-for-all-plan.html">6% wealth tax</a> on the ultrarich. </li>
        <li>Gates <a href="https://youtu.be/ZMMZ1Qzr1ag">discussed</a> how such a tax could affect him, saying, “I’ve paid over $10 billion in taxes ... more than anyone. If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math over what I have left over.”</li>
        <li>When asked if he would meet with the Massachusetts senator, Gates said, “I’m not sure how open-minded she is,” and didn’t seem confident Warren would sit down with him. </li>
        <li>Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1192237965113790466?s=20">responded</a> on Twitter, saying that she would be happy to meet with Gates: “If we get the chance, I’d love to explain exactly how much you’d pay under my wealth tax,” while also adding, “I promise it’s not $100 billion.”</li>
        <li>Gates <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1192462488895275010">tweeted back</a> this morning, and while he didn’t exactly agree to meet in person, he did express some interest in having a conversation with Warren about how to fight wealth inequality. “I’m always willing to talk about creative solutions to these problems,” he wrote. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Elizabeth Warren released a <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/calculator/ultra-millionaire-tax?source=soc-WB-ew-tw">new calculator</a> on Thursday that shows how much each billionaire would need to pay under her proposed wealth tax. “Some billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay,” she wrote in her <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1192531330581618700?s=20">Twitter post</a> (the calculator has pre-specified links for both Bill Gates and Leon Cooperman to click on). Under Warren’s plan, the calculator shows, Gates would have to pay $6.4 billion next year while Cooperman would pay just $151 million. </p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“I greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home,” Gates <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1192454910614196224?s=20">wrote</a>. “While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward.”</p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> With the 2020 election growing ever nearer, several billionaires and much of Wall Street have increasingly criticized Elizabeth Warren, whom they perceive as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-wall-street.html">threat to big business</a>. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">public feud</a> between Warren and Cooperman—who started the public debate—exemplifies the backlash that has appeared since the 2020 hopeful announced her 6% wealth tax on billionaires, which she says would finance her ambitious “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-elizabeth-warrens-205-trillion-medicare-for-all-plan/#6c05b7531d09">Medicare For All</a>” plan. Numerous billionaires have now joined the debate and spoken out against her criticism of the ultrarich, from JPMorgan Chase CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-enters-warren-billionaires-debate-she-uses-some-pretty-harsh-words/#7d925c667ea6">Jamie Dimon</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/billionaire-gop-donors-predict-stock-market-drop-if-these-democrats-win/#48954c949568">hedge fund billionaires</a> like Paul Tudor Jones and Steve Cohen. Several have even predicted that if Warren gets elected, the stock market would crash anywhere <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/billionaire-gop-donors-predict-stock-market-drop-if-these-democrats-win/#48954c949568">between 10% and 40%</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Big numbers:</b> Bill Gates is the second-richest person in the world, worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#2f500221689f">$106.9 billion</a>, while Leon Cooperman is worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/leon-g-cooperman/#7240858518f7">$3.2 billion</a>, according to <i>Forbes </i>estimates.</p>
