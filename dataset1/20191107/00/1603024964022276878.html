      <p>State-run <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/corporationbank/CB">Corporation Bank</a> onÂ November 7 said it will raise up to Rs 1,000 crore by issuing Basel III compliant bonds on a private placement basis.</p>
      <p>The bank is issuing Basel III compliant tier-2 bonds 2019-20 series of Rs 500 crore with green shoe option up to Rs 500 crore on private placement basis, it said in a regulatory filing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The bank said no issuer call option is available with the bond issue and the interest payment on the bond will be on annual basis and shall not be cumulative.</p>
      <p>Banks need to improve and strengthen their capital planning processes to comply with Basel-III capital regulations.</p>
      <p>These norms are being implemented to mitigate concerns on potential stresses on asset quality and consequential impact on performance and profitability of banks.</p>
      <p>The Indian banking system has been implementing Basel-III standards in phases since April 1, 2013.</p>
      <p>The banks were expected to fully implement these norms by March 2019. However, the Reserve Bank of India has shifted this date further by March 2020.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
