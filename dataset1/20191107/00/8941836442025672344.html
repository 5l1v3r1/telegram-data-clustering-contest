      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Led by 16 points from Makuach Maluach, five New Mexico players reached double figures and the Lobos put on a 92-71 show against Division II foe Eastern New Mexico in a season opener on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Carlton Bragg and Zane Martin each added 13 points and six rebounds for New Mexico. Corey Manigault also had 13 points and added three blocks for the Lobos.</p>
      <p>“Our team is not lacking for confidence,” New Mexico coach Paul Weir said. “We just have to find a way to harness that the right away.”</p>
      <p>Darius Sawyer scored 11 for the Greyhounds and Ibn Zaid had 10.</p>
      <p>The game was relatively close through the first 10 minutes as New Mexico led just 20-16 and had only extended that to 45-34 by halftime.</p>

      <p>But the Lobos opened the second half with a 16-4 run that gave them control of the game.</p>
      <p>“I thought that five-to-six-minute stretch there in the early part of the second half, these guys finally found a bit of a groove and played with the kind of intensity that I want them to play with all of the time,” Weir said. “We just need to find a way to play those stretches a little bit longer.”</p>
      <p>Although New Mexico put up plenty of points, shot 60% from the field and had 22 assists, including 11 from JaQuan Lyle, the Lobos also had 21 turnovers, with Martin getting six with no helpers.</p>
      <p>“Offense isn’t my concern right now,” Weir said. “We need to value the basketball more, which I think is a little bit more carelessness than it is skill and we just need to value it and respect it more. That’s something that’s easily fixable.”</p>

        <p>Eastern was even worse on the turnover end with 22 against just 12 assists.</p>
        <p>The Greyhounds out-rebounded New Mexico 37-36.</p>
        <p>“We were really keying on the rebounds stats,” said Eastern coach Tres Segler. “We finished the game one ahead of them and that was a big key for us.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>New Mexico opened with a tuneup that allowed Weir to get a good look at highly touted transfers Lyle (Ohio State), Martin (Towson) and J.J. Caldwell (Texas A&amp;M;).</p>
        <p>For Lyle, it was his first game since March 2017. He sat out the 2017-18 season as a transfer, then missed last season with a ruptured right Achilles suffered shortly before the season.</p>
        <p>“It felt amazing just to finally get up and down and just do what you love again,” he said.</p>
        <p>QUOTABLE</p>
        <p>Weir “getting that kind of talent to play that hard is a skill,” Segler said. “There are a lot of coaches that have elite talent and their kids don’t play as hard as these kids play. I knew they were going to play hard and I knew they were going to be big so I wanted to match that.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>New Mexico remains at home to face Cal State Northridge on Saturday. The teams opened the season last year at Northridge and New Mexico needed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to win 87-84.</p>
        <p>Eastern New Mexico goes to Durango on Saturday to face New Mexico Highlands in the Lone Star-Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Challenge.</p>
