Report: Succession’s Jeremy Strong Passed on a Role in The Batman
07 Nov 2019, 00:44 by Jake Abbate
Having multiple villains can sometimes hurt a superhero movie, but The Batman is taking its chances with three different rogues. Yesterday brought word that Colin Farrell was in talks to play the Penguin in Matt Reeves’ upcoming reboot. If Farrell signs on, he’ll menace Robert Pattinson’s Batman alongside Paul Dano’s Riddler and Zoe Kravitz’s Catwoman. However, a new development suggests that the film could re-introduce yet another one of the Dark Knight’s most famous enemies.
After it was announced that Farrell and Andy Serkis had begun negotiations to appear in The Batman as Penguin and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively, Variety’s Justin Kroll dropped one more bombshell on fans. Via Twitter, he shared that Warner Bros. was circling an actor from HBO’s Succession to star as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Unfortunately, the then-unnamed actor decided to pass on the role. You can check out his tweet for yourself below.

Later, The Wrap’s Umberto Gonzalez responded to Kroll’s tweet to clarify that the actor in question was Jeremy Strong. Strong has played Kendall Roy on Succession since the series premiered last year. But instead of Harvey Dent, the studio was apparently eyeing him to play “the Wasserman role” in the movie. Gonzalez didn’t provide any other clues about the nature of this role or why Strong turned it down. Still, it’s worth noting that he didn’t deny that Dent appears in the film’s script.
Hearing that Harvey Dent might have a role in The Batman is surprising, especially after Aaron Eckhart delivered a standout performance as the villain in The Dark Knight in 2008. It also doesn’t help that the last time Two-Face and the Riddler appeared in a movie together, it didn’t exactly go well. Of course, Reeves isn’t Joel Schumacher. And if Kroll’s reporting turns out to be accurate, it’s a safe bet that The Batman will handle the characters far better than Batman Forever did.
What are your thoughts on Harvey Dent/Two-Face possibly showing up in The Batman? Do you have any theories about the Wasserman role? Let us know in the comment section below!
