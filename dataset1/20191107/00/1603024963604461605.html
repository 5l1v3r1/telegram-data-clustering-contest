      <p>Public procurement portal Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is working on framework for ensuring payment to sellers within a guaranteed time frame, a senior official said.</p>
      <p>"We are working on a proposal wherein we will have a regime by which sellers would get payments in a specified time," GeM Chief Executive Officer Talleen Kumar said.</p>
      <p>He said that currently, the time frame for payment is 10 days but it gets extended and causes problem to sellers.</p>

      <p>The platform is also looking at ways through which banks can lend to sellers.</p>
      <p>"Through this process, banks can provide working capital for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). We can give transaction data to banks and based on transaction history of a seller and looking at their performance and rating, banks can lend. This kind of facility is possible on GeM," he said.</p>
      <p>Currently, MSMEs face problems in getting credit.</p>
      <p>For this, the platform is working on a robust online seller and buyer rating mechanisms which will allow sellers to avail working capital loans where the cost of capital is linked to the performance and rating of sellers.</p>
      <p>This will also help buyers to procure from highly rated sellers in critical areas of procurement, he said.</p>
      <p>Further, he said the platform would set up GeM Organisational and Transformation Team (GOTT) in the buyer organisations on an outcome-based self-sustenance model to realign the procurement process in that organisation and leverage the marketplace procurement platform to its fullest potential.</p>
      <p>It is also looking at ways to take on board artisans, weavers, start-ups which are not recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and self-help groups on the platform so that they can offer their goods, a senior official said.</p>
      <p>"We are working to give space for emporium products. The idea is how we can leverage GeM to increase incomes of artisans, weavers, and craftsman," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Work is underway to factor in technical solutions so that working capital and traceability of the items are available to buyers and sellers on the platform.</p>
      <p>More than 3,000 start-ups are already registered on GeM and they have received orders amounting to Rs 522 crore till date.</p>
      <p>Over 58,100 MSMEs are registered on the platform and they account for 50 per cent of the entire transactional value, which stood at Rs 36,000 crore.</p>
      <p>Further, he added that the commerce ministry is looking to widen the ambit of the platform by including government contractors and private entities for bulk-buying.</p>
      <p>Currently, government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.</p>
      <p>The portal was launched in August 2016 for online purchase of goods and services by all the central government ministries and departments as well as states.</p>
      <p>The portal provides a wide ranging products from office stationery to vehicles. Automobiles, computers and office furniture are currently the top product categories.</p>
      <p>Services, including transportation, logistics, waste management, web casting and analytical, among others, are listed on the portal.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
