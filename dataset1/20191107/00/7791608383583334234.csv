07 Nov 2019 by Thanussha Priyah
This November, the highly sought-after AirPods Pro are already getting their first price cut after a little over a week via Amazon. The online marketplace is scraping US$15 off the AirPods Pro, allowing buyers to get their hands on the earbuds for US$234.99. Some might want to wait till Black Friday to get the best deal out of their purchase, though the price of the regular AirPods was only reduced by US$7 during the previous massive sales event. Then again, the headphones market has become more competitive than ever, which means the cost of Apple’s noise-cancelling headphones could get lower. Advertisement Advertisement No one wants to feel the FOMO, but the choice is left in the shopper’s hands. You could grab the AirPods Pro, which comes with a charging case now at a discounted price or cross your fingers till the next sales event for a larger discount. Those who want to learn more about the AirPods Pro and its features can check out the video below.
