Topline: In its second-quarter earnings report, Take-Two Interactive said that the six-year-old Grand Theft Auto 5 has reached 115 million units sold-in, continuing the last-gen game’s incredible run.

Take-Two Interactive last spring reported the game hit 110 million.
Rockstar's hit helped Take-Two reach second-quarter profits of $71.8 million on $857.8 million of revenue, the latter of which is up 74% year-over-year but lower than analyst estimates of $919 million.
Revenue from in-game spending jumped up 39%, and in particular, Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto Online had its best quarter ever for daily, weekly and monthly active users, with in-game spending increasing 23%.
Rockstar added a substantial content update in July with “The Diamond Casino & Resort,” which raised eyebrows given the conversations occurring in the industry over what legally constitutes gambling in a game.
The quarter also featured the launch of loot shooter Borderlands 3, which sold-in 5 million copies in its first five days and has hit 7 million to date.

Big Number: Last year it was estimated that Grand Theft Auto 5 reached $6 billion in sales, making it one of the most profitable pieces of media ever.
