      <p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Sam Franklin scooped up a fumble and returned it 39 yards for Temple’s second touchdown and the Owls went on to a 17-7 victory over South Florida on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Christian Braswell punched the ball out of the grasp of receiver Terrence Horne and Franklin grabbed it and raced down the left sideline for a 14-0 lead in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Jager Gardner rushed for a career-high 133 yards on 25 carries, including a 57-yarder, while Jadan Blue caught 11 passes for 121 yards for the Owls. Quincy Roche led the defense with 3½ of the Owls’ nine sacks.</p>
      <p>Kenny Yeboah took a 1-yard pass from Todd Centeio with 1½ minutes left in the first half to complete a nine-play, 80-yard drive for the Owls (6-3, 3-2), who snapped a tie for third place with USF (4-5, 2-3) in the American Athletic Conference’s East Division.</p>
