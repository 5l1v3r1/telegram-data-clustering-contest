      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - An executive from the timeshare and resort industries is taking over as CEO of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seaworld-entertainment/">SeaWorld Entertainment</a>.</p>
      <p>The Orlando-based theme park company on Thursday said Sergio Rivera will be the next chief executive, and he’ll join the company’s board, starting next week.</p>
      <p>He succeeds Gustavo “Gus” Antorcha, who stepped down in September, just months into his tenure as chief executive. Antorcha said in a resignation statement that he had a different approach than the board.</p>
      <p>Rivera previously served as the president and CEO of ILG, Inc.’s vacation ownership segment.</p>
      <p>Before that, Rivera worked for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, where he was president of the Americas division.</p>
