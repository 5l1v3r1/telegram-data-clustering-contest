And if you aren’t convinced already, let Nocturnal Networks, the curator of FSZ, an initiative of Times Red Cell, tell you, “With the summit being a fulcrum to get the music industry discussing its opportunities and challenges with the global diaspora, the fest is touted to be the first-of-its kind in India”.
