海外輿論對中共四中全會的臆測，何以錯得離譜？
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by 德國之聲


我們想讓你知道的是中共高層有沒有政策分歧？有；有沒有路線分歧？或許也有，但中共自文革結束後，就摒棄了黨內路線鬥爭的說法。客觀上說，中共領導人間，是存在政策分歧的，但這種分歧，應該沒有大到海外輿論認為的那種權力鬥爭的程度。



文：鄧聿文（政治評論員，獨立學者，「中國戰略分析」智庫研究員兼中國戰略分析雜誌共同主編）
應該注意的一個現象是，用人事和權力鬥爭的眼光來看待中共和習中央，這非第一次，而一向如此。原因自然與中共不時爆發的黨鬥有關，何況習近平還高舉「偉大鬥爭」的旗幟。從該角度看，是次預測失誤，似乎並不能說明看問題的角度本身有問題，充其量只能說，這次他們鬥累了，需要中場休息一下。
鑑於中共是一個講究鬥爭的黨，且創黨近百年一路上就是在鬥爭的風雨中過來的，習近平尤其是一個善於鬥爭的高手，對中共用權力鬥爭的思維去觀察，是必要的。然而，在承認這點的同時，不能超越一個度，也不能忘記中共強調的另一面：團結，以及它發生的一些微妙變化。
在我看來，自薄熙來事件和周永康事件後，中共高層形成了一個共識，刑不上政治局委員，更不用講常委，包括現任和退休的成員，此乃因薄周事件對中共殺傷力太大，搞得高層包括退休元老人人自危，此種情況蔓延下去，黨用不著被外部敵人推翻，自己將毀於黨內的殘酷鬥爭。中共這條大船一翻，不論在台上還是台下，誰都跑不了，必會被人民所清算。故保住大船繼續能夠在海裡航行，是高層的最大公約數。中美貿易戰加強了這一共識。
如果我的看法接近事實，又該如何看待孫政才這個年輕的政治局委員的落馬？我認為這是薄周效應的餘震或餘波。當然不是說孫參與了薄周小集團，而指的是，在上一波以反腐名義開道的權力鬥爭中，因為習剛上台不久，他要清除反對他的政敵，以確保權力和統治的鞏固。在這一過程中，他需要拿個別現任的政治局成員開刀立威。不幸被孫政才遇上了。
經過6年強力反腐和對政敵的清洗，習已牢固樹立了不可撼動的權威，這在國慶大閱兵和本次全會上得以鮮明體現。但習也明白，拿一個政治局成員祭旗足矣，再動他們的乳酪，讓黨內高層有人身不保之虞，很有可能逼得黨內反習勢力鋌而走險，聯手一搏，這不利黨內團結，也是不必要的。加之美國這個外部「敵人」步步緊逼中共，習近平現在需要的是黨內特別是高層的團結，在服膺其權威的情況下，大家和氣一團，共同對外，這個外也包括中國內部的反共力量。
所以我們看到，在四全公報中，反腐沒有再提及。這不是說不會有反腐，而是反腐被導入常態。今後中央委員層級還是有人會落馬，但政治局層級不會有事。習近平四全發出的訊號要的就是讓他們放心，跟著他一塊拼經濟，抗外敵。這乃是我說的目前政治的微妙變化。
然而，海外多數輿論沒有注意到這點，陷在我在前文說的用權力鬥爭的眼光來觀察四中全會和習中央。對其中的很多人來說，本次四全時間的「延期」讓他們習慣性以為中共內部鬥爭激烈，習搞不定黨內的反對意見；他們也認為，中美貿易戰對習的權力打擊很大，加上香港問題，黨內對習的領導能力不滿，習要為當下中國和中共所處的險境負責，其想做終身領導人或長期執政的打算恐落空，需提前讓賢。
另外，四全召開前，海外媒體對中共高層的爆料讓輿論誤會圍繞著會議會有一番激烈的權力鬥爭，如習近平親自督辦的秦嶺案，據悉涉及中紀委書記趙樂際，紐時等報導了德銀對中共前總書記江澤民、前總理溫家寶及習的政治盟友、現常委栗戰書和王岐山的腐敗醜聞，這對全會都會產生影響；習本人則為進一步鞏固權力，做終身領導人，只做總書記還不夠，還要謀求做黨主席，等等。

表面看，上述因素似乎很有說服力，但只要仔細推敲，是經不起分析的。四中全會距離三中全會固然有一年多，然而，它並不是「延期」，確切地講，是三中全會提前開了。改開後，中共歷屆三、四、五、六、七中全會都是在每年的9－10月選個日子舉行，所以今次四全10月底召開不是「延期」，瞭解這個事實就不會由「延期」而判斷是人事出了問題導致全會遲開。中美貿易戰和香港抗爭可能確實使習近平的權威受到影響，但這個影響是否大到要習提前確立接班人或增加常委的程度？看看中共的文宣絲毫沒有降低對習的吹捧就清楚。即使對此還有疑慮，國慶大閱兵也說明習對權力的掌控絲毫沒有動搖。
至於德銀醜聞，那是十多年前發生的事情，而且直接涉及的元老和高層接受的禮品並不多，這更多的是中國關係文化下的產物，習不可能拿此事對他們進行問罪。趙樂際的問題，假使他真涉秦嶺案，習會敲打他，削弱其權力，讓他自然到點退休，而不會公開讓他下課，讓別人代替中紀委書記一職。除非趙的問題非常嚴重，否則，中途換將歷來是中共用人大忌，何況如上所說，習目前謀求的是黨內高層團結，不可能為立威讓趙下課，這樣震動太大。最後，習即使想做黨主席，也不會在四全提出，因為這涉及修改黨章問題，而改黨章是黨代會的權利。習的權力尚沒有大到公然不顧黨章的地步。上述分析是中共政治的常識，觀察中共而不瞭解其常識，是一些人常犯的錯誤。
中共高層有沒有政策分歧？有；有沒有路線分歧？或許也有，但中共自文革結束後，就摒棄了黨內路線鬥爭的說法。客觀上說，中共領導人間，是存在政策分歧的，但這種分歧，應該沒有大到海外輿論認為的那種權力鬥爭的程度。在目前內外環境非常尖銳，不利中共的情形下，黨內高層明白，無論喜不喜歡習，他們都是一個共生體，一損俱損，一榮俱榮，只能綁在習近平這個新黨國的戰車上，陪著習狂奔。

Why is the speculation of overseas public opinion on the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party?
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by Voice of Germany


What we want you to know is whether there are any policy differences at the top of the CCP? Yes; is there any route difference? Perhaps there are also, but after the end of the Cultural Revolution, the CCP abandoned the argument of the party’s line of struggle. Objectively speaking, there are policy differences between the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, but such differences should not be as large as the power struggles that overseas public opinion believes.



Text: Deng Yuwen (political commentator, independent scholar, think tank of ""China Strategic Analysis"" think tank and co-editor of China Strategic Analysis Magazine)
One phenomenon that should be noted is that it is not the first time to look at the CCP and Xizhong in the eyes of personnel and power struggles. The reason is naturally related to the party struggle that the CCP has erupted from time to time. Moreover, Xi Jinping also holds high the banner of ""great struggle."" From this point of view, this prediction error does not seem to indicate that there is a problem in the perspective of the problem. At best, it can only be said that this time they are tired and need to take a break.
In view of the fact that the CCP is a party that pays attention to struggle, and that the party has come over the past few hundred years along the way, Xi Jinping, especially a master who is good at fighting, is necessary to observe the thinking of the power struggle in China. However, while acknowledging this, we cannot surpass one degree, nor can we forget the other side of the CCP’s emphasis: unity, and some subtle changes that have occurred.
In my opinion, since the incident of Bo Xilai and Zhou Yongkang, the CCP’s top management has formed a consensus that it is not a member of the Politburo, not to mention the Standing Committee, including current and retired members. This is because of the CCP’s killing of the CCP. The power is too great, and the high-level, including the retired yuan, is self-defeating. If this situation spreads, the party will not be overthrown by external enemies, and it will be destroyed in the cruel struggle within the party. The CCP’s big ship has been turned over. No matter who is on the stage or under the stage, no one can run, and it will be liquidated by the people. Therefore, it is the highest common denominator of the upper level to keep the big ship and continue to sail in the sea. The Sino-US trade war has strengthened this consensus.
If my views are close to the facts, how should I look at the fall of Sun Zhengcai, a young Politburo member? I think this is the aftershock or aftershock of the thin week effect. Of course, it is not that Sun participated in the Bo Zhou Group, but that in the last wave of power struggles in the name of anti-corruption, because Xi Gang came to power soon, he wanted to clear the political opponents against him to ensure the consolidation of power and rule. . In the process, he needs to take the initiative of the incumbent Politburo members. Unfortunately, Sun Zhengcai met.
After 6 years of strong anti-corruption and cleaning of political enemies, Xi has firmly established an unshakable authority, which is vividly reflected in the National Day military parade and this plenary session. However, Xi also understands that taking a member of the Politburo’s flag is enough to move their cheese and let the high-level members of the party be insured. It is very likely that the party’s anti-reform forces will be forced to take risks and join hands. Unity within the party is also unnecessary. In addition, the external ""enemy"" of the United States is pressing the CCP step by step. What Xi Jinping needs now is the unity of the party, especially the high-level. In the case of obeying its authority, everyone is amiable and common, and this also includes anti-communism within China. power.
Therefore, we have seen that in the four full communiqués, anti-corruption has not been mentioned. This is not to say that there will be no anti-corruption, but that anti-corruption is introduced into the normal state. In the future, there will still be people at the level of the Central Committee, but there will be no problems at the Politburo level. The signal sent by Xi Jinping is to reassure them, to fight with him and fight against foreign enemies. This is the subtle change in the current politics that I am talking about.
However, most overseas public opinion did not notice this, and I was caught in the vision of power struggle in the previous article to observe the Fourth Plenary Session and the Central Committee. For many of them, the ""deferred"" of this four-time period made them habitually think that the internal struggle of the CCP is fierce, and they are not sure about the opposition within the party. They also believe that the power struggle between China and the United States is very strong. Big, plus the Hong Kong issue, the party is dissatisfied with the leadership ability of Xi, and Xi is responsible for the dangers of China and the CCP. The intention of being a lifelong leader or a long-term ruling is frustrating.
In addition, before the Fourth National Conference, the overseas media broke the high-level CCP’s high-level public opinion misunderstanding that there would be a fierce power struggle around the meeting, such as the Qinling case that Xi Jinping personally supervised. It is reported that Zhao Leji, secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and New York Times reported that Deutsche Bank The corruption scandals of former CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, former Premier Wen Jiabao, and Xi’s political allies, the current Standing Committee and Wang Qishan’s corruption scandals will have an impact on the plenary session; Xi himself will further consolidate power and be a lifelong leader. The general secretary is not enough, but he also wants to be the party chairman, and so on.

On the surface, the above factors seem to be very convincing, but as long as they are carefully scrutinized, they cannot withstand analysis. The Fourth Plenary Session is certainly more than a year away from the Third Plenary Session. However, it is not an ""extension"". To be exact, the Third Plenary Session has been opened ahead of schedule. After the re-opening, the CCP's previous three, four, five, six, and seven plenary sessions were held on the days of September-October each year. Therefore, the fourth round of the end of October is not an ""extension"". It was judged by the ""extension"" that there was a problem with the personnel, which led to the late opening of the plenary session. The Sino-US trade war and Hong Kong's struggle may indeed affect Xi Jinping's authority, but is this influence so large that it is necessary to learn to establish a successor or increase the standing committee in advance? It is clear to see that the CCP’s propaganda has not lowered the touting of the Xi. Even if there are doubts about this, the National Day military parade also shows that the control of power has not wavered.
As for the German banking scandal, it happened more than a decade ago, and the elders and senior officials directly involved did not receive much gifts. This is more a product of Chinese relationship culture. It is impossible for Xi to take this matter to them. condemn. Zhao Leji’s question, if he was really involved in the Qinling case, the martial arts beat him, weakened his power, and let him naturally retire, instead of letting him go to class and let others replace the secretary of the Central Disciplinary Committee. Unless Zhao’s problem is very serious, the middle of the exchange will always be a taboo for the Chinese shareholder. What’s more, as mentioned above, Xi’s current pursuit is the high-level unity within the party, and it’s impossible for Li Wei to let Zhao go to class, so the shock is too great. In the end, even if Xi wants to be the party chairman, it will not be proposed in Siquan, because it involves the revision of the party constitution, and the change of the party constitution is the right of the party congress. The power of Xi has not been so large that it is blatantly disregarding the party constitution. The above analysis is the common sense of the CCP politics. Observing the CCP without understanding its common sense is a common mistake made by some people.
Are there any policy differences at the top of the CCP? Yes; is there any route difference? Perhaps there are also, but after the end of the Cultural Revolution, the CCP abandoned the argument of the party’s line of struggle. Objectively speaking, there are policy differences between the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, but such differences should not be as large as the power struggles that overseas public opinion believes. At a time when the internal and external environment is very sharp and unfavorable to the CCP, the party’s top management understands that no matter whether they like it or not, they are all symbiotic, and they are all devastated and can only be tied to the chariot of Xi Jinping’s new party state. , accompanied by the mad rush.
