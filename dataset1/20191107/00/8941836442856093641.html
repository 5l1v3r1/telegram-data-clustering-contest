      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - A new study finds <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-bank-stadium/">U.S. Bank Stadium</a> and three high-rise buildings account for a high proportion of bird fatalities among 21 buildings surveyed in downtown Minneapolis.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-star/">The Star</a> Tribune reports the study in PLOS One found the stadium and three unidentified towers were involved in 74% of collisions and 68% of fatalities among the buildings studied.</p>
      <p>Data from two migratory seasons indicate around 111 birds died annually in collisions with the stadium.</p>
      <p>The Minnesota Vikings and the stadium authority paid for the study, which was promoted by conservationists’ concerns about birds following the Mississippi River corridor colliding with the stadium’s glass walls.</p>
      <p>Jerry Bahls of the Audubon Chapter of Minneapolis says the study appears to confirm their concerns and they want the Vikings and stadium authority to address the problem.</p>
