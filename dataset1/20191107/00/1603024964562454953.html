      <p>Hence, Nomura upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised target price to Rs 222 from Rs 203 per share, implying a 19 percent potential upside from current levels.</p>
      <p>For auto original equipment manufacturer (OEM), the brokerage expects a 15 percent decline in FY20 followed by 8 percent CAGR over FY20-22 and for industrial segment, it expects Exide to deliver 7.5 percent volume CAGR over FY20-22.</p>
      <p>Nomura lowered its margin estimates over FY20-22 to 13.7 percent/13.3 percent/13.7 percent from 13.8 percent/14 percent/14.1 percent.</p>
      <p>Despite the steep fall in revenues of the OEM segment, Exide's Q2FY20 revenues declined only marginally by 4 percent YoY to Rs 2,610 crore, owing to healthy growth in the replacement and industrial segments.</p>
      <p>The weak volumes in the auto OEM and telecom segment was offset by continued growth in replacement, UPS, Solar and other industrial segments.</p>
      <p>EBITDA margin expanded 180bps YoY to 14.1 percent, which beat analysts estimates due to benign lead prices and better mix.</p>
      <p>Better operating performance and lower tax rate at 15.6 percent drive adjusted PAT growth by 30.8 percent YoY at Rs 240 crore.</p>
      <p>Emkay expects margins to improve by 110bps over FY19-22E, driven by better scale and cost-reduction efforts.</p>
      <p>"The stock currently trades at a core P/E of 13x/12x on FY21/22E EPS. We maintain buy rating with a revised target price of Rs 260 (Rs 266 earlier), implying 39 percent potential upside from current levels," said the brokerage.</p>
      <p>Prabhudas Lilladher maintained its accumulate rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 218, implying 17 percent potential upside from current levels (earlier Rs 208) based on 17x Sep'21E standalone EPS plus value of insurance business vertical).</p>
      <p>The research house increased FY20/21 EPS estimates by 14.3 percent/6 percent to factor in for lower raw material and tax rate.</p>
      <p>The stock was quoting at Rs 189.15, up Rs 2.60, or 1.39 percent on the BSE at 1025 hours IST.</p>
