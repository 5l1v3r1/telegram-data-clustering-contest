      <h1>China says it has agreed with the US to cancel tariffs in phases</h1>

      <p>China and the United States have agreed to a phased rollback of tariffs that were imposed during the course of their months-long trade war, the Chinese commerce ministry told Reuters on November 7.</p>
      <p>Gao Feng, the Chinese commerce ministry's spokesperson, said that both the countries must simultaneously start removing some tariffs on each other's goods to ensure they are able to reach a "phase one" deal.</p>
      <p>The removal of tariffs is an important condition for the sparring countries to come to an agreement, he said at a press briefing.</p>

      <p>"The trade war started with tariffs, and should end with the cancellation of tariffs," Gao told reporters.</p>
      <p>He did not, however, give a timeline.</p>
      <p>Chinese negotiators wanted the US to drop the 15 percent tariff that went into effect on September 1 on about $125 billion worth of Chinese goods, a source previously told Reuters.</p>
      <p>They are also seeking relief from earlier 25 percent tariffs on about $250 billion of imports from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.</p>
      <p>A deal may be signed this month by US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a yet-to-be determined location.</p>
      <p>Dozens of venues have been suggested for a meeting, which had originally been scheduled to take place on the sidelines of a now-cancelled mid-November summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, a senior official of the Trump administration told Reuters on November 6.</p>
      <p>One possible location was London, where the two leaders could meet after a NATO summit that Trump is due to attend from December 3-4, the official said.</p>
      <p>Gao declined to say when and where such a meeting could be.</p>
