      <p>CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo. (AP) - The Latest on the trial of a Colorado man charged with killing his fiancee (all times local):</p>
      <p>6 p.m.</p>
      <p>A woman who was having an affair with a Colorado man charged with beating his fiancee to death and burning her body says he called her on Thanksgiving Day and told her she had “a mess to clean up,” referring to the aftermath of the slaying.</p>
      <p>Krystal Lee, who no longer goes by her former married name of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee-kenney/">Kenney</a>, took the stand Wednesday in the trial of 33-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Patrick Frazee</a>, who has denied killing 29-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Kelsey Berreth</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a> was last seen nearly a year ago with her baby near her home in Woodland Park, about two hours south of Denver.</p>

      <p>Lee testified that before the 2018 call, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> had asked her three times to kill <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a> on his behalf, but she didn’t follow through. Prosecutors say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> personally told Lee he was responsible for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s death, and on Wednesday, she testified that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> told her <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s last words were “Please stop.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee-kenney/">Krystal Lee Kenney</a> was testifying Wednesday at the trial of 33-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Patrick Frazee</a>, who has denied killing 29-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Kelsey Berreth</a>.</p>
        <p>She was last seen nearly a year ago with the couple’s daughter near her home in Woodland Park, about two hours south of Denver.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee-kenney/">Kenney</a>, who was a nurse in Idaho, pleaded guilty to evidence tampering for moving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s cellphone.</p>
        <p>Attorneys focused much of their opening statements last week on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee-kenney/">Kenney</a>. Prosecutors told jurors <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> asked her at least three times to kill <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>. The defense questioned <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee-kenney/">Kenney</a>’s honesty, saying she lied to the FBI.</p>
