      <h1>This Ingenious Hat Blocks Facial Recognition</h1>

      <h3>Yo Dawg</h3>
      <p>Protestors and police in Hong Kong have found themselves in an escalating arms race of high tech surveillance.</p>
      <p>While the protestors <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/hong-kong-protesters-lasers-facial-recognition">have used lasers</a> to disable the facial recognition-equipped surveillance cameras, police have taken to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/hong-kong-dye-spraying-protesters">spraying them with dye</a> so they can be identified and arrested up later on.</p>
      <p>Now, one Redditor is showing off a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dsbmjh/inspired_by_the_protests_i_made_a_cap_that_blocks/">prototype of a hat</a> that he says can block facial recognition surveillance with a low-tech trick: the cap unfurls to cover up the wearer’s face with an image of another face, a groundbreaking development otherwise known as “wearing a mask.”</p>
      <h3>Halloween Clearance Sale</h3>
      <p>It’s admittedly a nice touch to make the hat unfurl into an image of Xi Jinping, China’s current president, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/07/china-bans-winnie-the-pooh-film-to-stop-comparisons-to-president-xi">banned Winnie the Pooh</a> from the country after people compared him to the cartoon bear.</p>
      <p>But since Hong Kong has already <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/hong-kong-bans-face-masks">made it illegal</a> to wear “facial covering that is likely to prevent identification” during public protests, the hat isn’t likely to do much good at this point — just wearing it could be grounds for arrest.</p>
      <p>At the very least, it could help people finally perfect their Jinping cosplay.</p>
