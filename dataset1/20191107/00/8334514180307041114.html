      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - BP is investing 10 million euros ($11.08 million) in Finnish transportation app Whim as the oil and gas company seeks to expand its role in a future low-carbon world.</p>
      <p>BP’s new technology investments have so far focused on electric vehicle charging platforms such as FreeWire and PowerShare and reduction of emissions from oil and gas drilling.</p>
      <p>Although the Whim investment is minuscule for the $135.20 billion company, it is a first step into ride sharing and app-driven technology.</p>
      <p>Whim, which is developed by MaaS Global, offers customers a single platform to connect all available transport options in a city from taxis, buses, bikes and rental cars to ride-hailing services and shared e-scooters and e-bikes.</p>
      <p>After launching Whim in Helsinki in 2017, MaaS Global has made the service available in Birmingham, Vienna and Antwerp.</p>
      <p>BP’s investment will support plans to roll out the app in additional cities around the world, including Singapore and in the United States.</p>
