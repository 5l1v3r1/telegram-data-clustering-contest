我們想讓你知道的是不曉得你家府上是否也曾出現這樣的場景呢？而這便是《媳婦，也是別人的掌上明珠》一書的作者，所需經歷不斷的婆媳過招，身陷婆家深似海的她，真可謂一步一擂台，半點不留神便將失守千里土。



文：曾治淇心理師
王家衛的《一代宗師》裡，有幕戲是北派武林盟主宮家老爺在金盆洗手前，與代表南武林的葉問搭手切磋的橋段。戲裡宮老爺與葉問的武藝過招，由葉能否掰開宮手中所執的餅來定勝負，比身位也比手法，高妙至極。
想像一下，將場景從比武金樓移到了廚房水槽，主角由宮、葉替換為婆媳，原本的餅取代為洗碗手套，婆媳對壘於髒碗穢盤堆疊成牆的洗碗槽前，勝負條件設定為媳婦能否順利將洗碗手套卸下並交棒給其他幫手，亦或將遭婆婆中途攔截阻斷，讓卸不下手套的媳婦墮入無間輪迴的洗碗地獄。
不曉得你家府上是否也曾出現這樣的場景呢？而這便是《媳婦，也是別人的掌上明珠》一書的作者，所需經歷不斷的婆媳過招，身陷婆家深似海的她，真可謂一步一擂台，半點不留神便將失守千里土。

位處東亞的我們常能不時耳聞，台灣女權的國際評比排名屌打日韓兩國，也常在跨國婚姻等異國文化交流經驗中，聽到日女誇讚台男溫柔體貼，亦或是韓國的大男人文化較為根深柢固等國情差異。而當我拜讀了《媳婦，也是別人的掌上明珠》這本韓國媳婦的辛酸血淚史後，更能感受到高麗文化中的許多婆婆，彷彿還板著花系列時代下陳莎莉、席曼寧所演繹的惡婆婆面孔。反觀我們的台式婆婆，則已較能演進到像導演是枝裕和御用的樹木希林奶奶，以敦厚溫良對待晚輩。
當然，仍是有許多例外，總有許多在水深火熱之中度日的台灣苦命媳，況且即便相比日韓文化我國的婆媳修羅場已較為友善，但「比較痛苦並不代表能消除痛苦」，因此，借鏡人家的媳婦是如何熬出頭的攻略紀事，實為修練人生的補帖良方。
《媳婦，也是別人的掌上明珠》一書的作者雖以逆媳自稱，可作者其實本來也一心夢想成為能和婆婆一起上街購物、像女兒般的媳婦。但是又何奈，在一次又一次的被格差待遇及虐心要求後，作者體悟到婆家原生血脈與嫁過來的媳婦之間，總有條再怎麼努力也難以消弭的界線。
從籌辦婚禮開始，舉凡挑選婚宴場地、宴客菜色、交通方式到喜帖印製內容等大小縟節，婆家給媳婦的考驗便已開始，也預告揭示了作者即將正式粉墨登場人妻、人媳的生存試煉舞台。
加冕成為媳婦之後，每個節日對作者來說，都是勞動節。對婆婆來說，兒子可以不記得祭祀節慶、家人生日等婆家要事，媳婦卻千不該萬不該遺忘不上心。娘家人的生日作者尚且記不牢，卻需要牢記甚或包辦婆家人的生日甚至公婆結婚紀念日。「媳婦啊，你知道下星期要祭祖吧？」「媳婦啊，你幾點來？」「媳婦啊，你不需要買東西，只要給錢就好。」「媳婦啊，下班了嗎？你等一下幾點到？」從備料、烹煮、上菜，到最後的收拾、清潔、洗碗，男士不下灶雖已約定成俗，可本該通力分工的小姑及婆婆，卻常藉故翹頭偷雞納涼，落得孝媳該死一人獨挑苦差。
你以為只有婆婆會折媳婦的壽嗎？當然不。傳說中的小姑怎能缺席，更不幸的是連婆家女婿都來補刀。對婆家而言，「女婿是客人，媳婦是工人。」「媳婦帶伴手禮來是理所當然該本分進貢，女婿帶來的便是親家御賜的無上恩膏。」如此格差待遇，讓媳婦的悲催苦情雪上加霜。
作者眼見自己在婆家苦行的媳婦人生節節敗退、黯淡無望，既不被當家人、更不配當客人，原以為「只要我忍耐，大家都會幸福」，後來發現是「除了我以外的大家都會幸福」，於是想起自己曾被身為乖媳婦模範生的媽媽這般告誡：「不要像媽媽這樣生活，因為那是沒有人認同，被迫犧牲而不斷受傷的生活。」為了不重蹈母親的命運，作者發願翻轉苦媳人生，來場人在婆家的客場逆轉勝。
此後，婆媳過招的對手戲開啟了新篇章，作者娓娓道來自己是如何扭轉劣勢、收復失土的。台式經典歌謠裡傳頌著「孝順的媳婦是三頓燒，不孝的媳婦是過路搖」，而作者正是看透了，傳統孝媳偶爾一次無心的過路搖，便易遭人人喊打斥為大逆不道，遂決心捨棄孝媳美名，因為不孝媳婦偶一為之的三頓燒，便可驚為天人傳為佳話。於是作者將原本被婆家視為慣例、理所當然的送禮進貢，改弦易轍為非定期定額、讓婆家意料之外的隨機驚喜。
為了逆轉勝，作者深謀遠慮、花招百出，除了上例之外，還將伴侶從相看兩厭的豬隊友，循循馴化成能相濡以沫的神隊友。惟因作者招式精妙繁多，在此遂不一一備載詳述，欲練功者還請自行拜讀。
可能為避免家醜事蹟敗漏脛走後，恐將招來風雨波瀾等蝴蝶效應，故作者採匿名寫作，但也正因為匿了名，所以更能率直敢言、葷素無忌、辛辣全開。像是直言自己就是因為貪慕虛榮所以喜歡昂貴名牌包，且其極盡諷刺揶揄的酸言厲語，讓讀者得以與媳婦共享大吐怨念的暢快爽感。而作者除了文筆一流、口吻風趣外，更是言之有物，峰迴路轉的劇情著實扣人心弦，讓看倌欲知下級分曉遂欲罷不能的追下去，迫不及待看到苦媳是如何翻轉劣勢、收復尊嚴。
其實，每一位婆婆也都曾經為人媳婦，也是自三從四德等諸多文化教條中熬成婆的，然也正因為傳統孝媳需相父教子持家有方，故犧牲了最多的自我追求及意志實踐。但被犧牲、抹煞、壓抑掉的自我意志，總會找到它的出口，不得施展於江湖世面的，將寄情於家業操持。被獻祭給家庭的自我，將變形為期許，期許能自家族事務中獲得補償，獲得自我意志的伸張與支配。
於是，當苦媳總算熬成婆了，負重小卒總算熬成當家大腕了，怎能不以頂天之姿，身體力行傳承婦道古訓？又怎會樂見下一代的媳婦非但不恪守習俗禮法，甚至意圖顛覆老人言呢？
是故，沒有三兩三，逆媳也甭想起義，如同葉問若不是真功夫，也無法自從無敗績的宮家老爺手中取勝。而《媳婦，也是別人的掌上明珠》一書，除了正是本修練親情的武林秘笈外，更是一份祝福，祝福有緣修習婆媳相處之道的天下眾生，皆能離苦得樂，修成正果。

Text: Zeng Zhiqi Psychologist
In Wang Jiawei's ""A Generation of Masters"", there is a scene in which the northern martial arts lord of the martial arts empire is washing hands before the golden basin and talking with Ye Wen, who represents Nan martin. In the drama, the prince of the palace and Ye Wen’s martial arts tricks, whether the leaves can open the cake in the hands of the palace to determine the outcome, than the body is also better than the technique.
Imagine moving the scene from the Bijinjin Building to the kitchen sink. The protagonist is replaced by the palace and the leaves, and the original cake is replaced by a dishwashing glove. The mother-in-law is in front of the dirty bowl and the tray is stacked in the wall of the sink. Set whether the wife can successfully remove the dishwashing gloves and hand it to other helpers, or will be intercepted and blocked by her mother-in-law, so that the daughter who can not remove the gloves breaks into the bowling hell of the reincarnation.
I don't know if there has been such a scene in your house? This is the author of the book ""Women, the Pearl of Others"". It is necessary to experience the constant temptations of her mother-in-law.

In East Asia, we can often hear from time to time that Taiwan’s feminist international rankings beat Japan and South Korea, and often in foreign cultural exchanges and other experiences of foreign cultural exchanges, I heard that Japanese women praised Taiwan’s gentle and considerate, or South Korea’s The culture of big men is deeper and deeper than national conditions. When I read the history of the bitterness and tears of the Korean daughter-in-law, ""The daughter-in-law, it is also the jewel of others,"" I can feel many mother-in-laws in the Korean culture, as if I still have the mother-in-law of Chen Shali and Xi Manning. face. On the other hand, our desktop mother-in-law has evolved to a grandmother, Shilin, who is a director of the tree and the royal family.
Of course, there are still many exceptions. There are always many hardships in Taiwan that are in dire straits. Even if it is more friendly than the Japanese and Korean cultures in our country, ""the more pain does not mean that we can eliminate the pain"", so How to use the mirrored family's daughter-in-law is how to slap the head of the Raiders, which is a good way to practice life.
Although the author of ""The Daughter-in-law, the Pearl of Others"" is self-proclaimed, the author actually dreams of becoming a daughter-in-law who can go shopping with her mother-in-law. However, He Nai, after being repeatedly asked for treatment and grievances, the author realized that there is always a line between the original blood of the mother-in-law and the married woman who is married.
From the start of the wedding, the selection of the wedding venue, the banquet dishes, the transportation method to the printed content of the wedding invitations, etc., the test of the wife to the wife has begun, and the notice reveals that the author is about to officially appear on the wife and the survival test of the people. Refine the stage.
After Camus became a daughter-in-law, every festival is a Labor Day for the author. For the mother-in-law, the son can not remember the festivals, family birthdays, and other things, but the daughter-in-law should never forget the heart. The birthday of the mother’s family is still not well remembered, but it needs to be remembered or even included in the birthday of the wife’s family or even the in-laws’ wedding anniversary. ""Women, do you know that you want to worship the ancestors next week?"" ""Women, what time are you coming?"" ""Women, you don't need to buy anything, just give money."" ""Women, are you getting off work? You Wait a minute?"" From preparation, cooking, serving, to the final cleaning, cleaning, washing dishes, although the men have not agreed to the custom, but the cousin of the division of labor and mother-in-law, but often borrowed Stealing the chicken is cool, and the filial piety is damned.
Do you think that only the mother-in-law will fold the wife's life? of course not. How can the legendary little sister be absent, and even more unfortunately, even the daughter-in-law of the mother-in-law has come to fill the knife. For the husband's family, ""the son-in-law is a guest, and the daughter-in-law is a worker."" ""It is a matter of course that the wife will bring the tribute to the tribute, and the son-in-law will bring the anointing of the royal family."" Let the wife’s sadness and bitterness worsen.
The author sees that his wife, who is abusive in her family, is reluctant, bleak and hopeless. She is neither being a family member nor a guest. She thought that ""as long as I am patient, everyone will be happy."" Later, I found out that everyone except me will be happy. Then I remembered that my mother, who was a model woman of a wife, warned: ""Don't live like a mother, because it is a life that no one agrees and is forced to sacrifice and is constantly hurt."" In order not to repeat the fate of the mother. The author made a wish to reverse the bitter life, and the people who came to the scene turned against the victory in the away game.
Since then, the opponent's play has opened a new chapter, the author swears how he reversed the disadvantages and recovered the lost soil. In the classic table songs, ""The filial daughter-in-law is three burns, and the unfilial daughter-in-law is crossing the road."" The author is seeing through it. The traditional filial piety occasionally makes an unintentional pass, and it is easy for everyone to shout for rebellion. I am determined to abandon the filial piety, because the three sorrows of the filial daughter-in-law will be shocked to be a good story. Therefore, the author regards the tribute that was originally regarded as a routine and taken for granted by the husband's family, and changed the string to a non-regular quota, which would surprise the husband.
In order to reverse the victory, the author has a long-term vision and a lot of tricks. In addition to the above example, the companion will also follow the two-faced pig teammates and follow up and become a teammate who can match each other. However, due to the exquisite and versatile style of the authors, I will not elaborate on them here. If you want to practice, please read them by yourself.
It may be that in order to avoid the ugly mistakes, the fear will bring in the butterfly effect, so the author writes anonymously, but it is also because of the name, so it can be more straightforward, ignorant, and full of pungency. It is like bluntly saying that you are eager for vanity, so you like expensive brand-name bags, and its extremely ironic and sardonic words, so that readers can share the feeling of excitement with their daughter-in-law. In addition to the first-class writing, the tone of the author, the author is even more eloquent, and the story of the peak-turning is really exciting, so that you can't wait to see the subordinates know how to turn over the disadvantages and regain their dignity.
In fact, every mother-in-law has once been a daughter-in-law, and she has also become a woman from many cultural disciplines such as the four virtues. However, because traditional filial piety requires the father to teach the family, it sacrifices the most self-pursuit and will. practice. However, the self-will of being sacrificed, smeared, and suppressed will always find its export, and it will not be displayed in the rivers and lakes, and will be sentimental in the family business. The self that is sacrificed to the family will be transformed into a promise, and it is expected that compensation will be obtained from the family affairs, and the self-will will be extended and dominated.
Therefore, when the bitterness finally became a woman, the weight-bearing pawn finally became a big-name master. How can we not follow the example of the heavens? How can we be pleased to see the next generation of daughter-in-law not only obeying customary rituals, but even intending to subvert the old sayings?
Therefore, there are no three or two, and the anti-insurgency also thinks of the uprising. If Ye Wen is not really kung fu, he can't win from the unsuccessful palace master. The book ""Women, the Pearl of Others"" is a blessing in addition to the martial arts secrets of this family. It is a blessing to bless the worldly beings who have the opportunity to practice their mother-in-law.
