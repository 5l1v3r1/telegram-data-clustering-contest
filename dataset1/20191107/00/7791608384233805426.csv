Watch: Woman Sprays Breast Milk At EDM Festival While Festival-Goers Cheer
07 Nov 2019 by Yimin Huang
A clip of a woman spraying breast milk into a crowd at an EDM festival has been captured by a man named Eric Falconi. The woman wore a black one-piece swimming costume or leotard, a black cap and some boots in the viral footage. She started off dancing and twerking to the music, which may be nothing surprising at the festival, but soon surprised the crowd by whipping out her breasts. As the crowd cheered on, she became more audacious and started spraying them with quite a lot of breast milk. Far from being repulsed by her bizarre moves, some festival-goers even leaned close to catch the breast milk in their mouth. Exclamations like “Jesus Christ!” and “oh sh***” can be heard from the clip. The footage was captured at EDM at Dirtybird Campout in South California last month and became viral on Twitter before it was apparently deleted. Still, people’s reactions are up, with many feeling disturbed by the act. One asked to “suspend internet services” while another made fun of the EDM festival as being usually about “projecting bodily fluids.” Still, those present when the incident happened seemed to really enjoy themselves.
