宋楚瑜來了，台灣民眾黨就要逐漸邊緣化了
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是宋曾和柯文哲合作，也曾出任過小英的APEC代表，但這些「非藍」合作卻讓原本支持群眾因水土不服而油水分離，因此，「偏綠」的柯文哲若與宋採取合作方案，會不會反讓柯文哲的支持群眾油水分離？



文：紀齊修（輿情分析師）
媒體刊載親民黨黨主席宋楚瑜將第五度參選總統，據稱答案似乎「呼之欲出」。親民黨臉書社群發聲管道《親民新聞》日前刊出4段媒體專訪內容，宋楚瑜強調「人民需要第三種選擇」，擺出搶攻「討厭民進黨」與「討厭國民（瑜）黨」的代言人陣勢，顯然與柯文哲所想是同一目標。
而若想要登上老大寶座，究竟是主動還是被動好呢？從歷史看來，好像被動登上是比較高分的，遠者有趙匡胤的黃袍加身，近者有諸多長者道德勸說才「勉強參加」選舉的馬英九。而柯文哲與民眾黨的被動條件似乎是不充沛的，只能積極主動整合第三勢力其他組織為佳。
實質上，第三勢力大哥地位與實力的關鍵，就在於是否能夠整合國、民兩黨之外的第三勢力，而稱得上名號的其他「政治山頭」——不論是柯文哲還是宋楚瑜——近年來與小黨的接觸穿梭並不算少，而且相比起來，柯文哲的籌碼顯然比宋楚瑜還要豐沛，因為他背後具有整個台北市政府龐大的資源可以分配調度，宋楚瑜卻只有副總統、1-3席不分區以及立院黨團可以被交換，明顯寒摻許多。
因此雖然宋楚瑜具有總統門票，但柯文哲並不處於整合小黨中劣勢的一方。
根據10月29日的美麗島電子報民調，柯文哲與民眾黨的群眾基礎多落於綠色區塊，這讓「民眾黨是否應該與泛藍陣營的宋楚瑜合作」的問題，更顯得耐人尋味。過去，宋曾經因為和柯文哲合作而被稱「橘子綠了」，也曾出任過小英的APEC代表，宋跟這些概念上「非藍」的對象站同一陣線，讓原本的支持群眾因水土不服而油水分離，因此這一次不論是什麼情況，是否與他人合作，披掛的都必須是親民黨推薦印記，讓親民黨重新回到泛藍的光譜裡。
因此，柯文哲若採取合作方案，會不會反而讓柯文哲的支持群眾水土不服而油水分離？讓柯粉掉落轉回小英，或喜樂島、一邊一國、綠黨、時力等小黨懷抱？甚至導致柯文哲與民眾黨因此被掏空？不論是哪一種情況，未來民眾黨的支持度，一定會因為親民黨的活動增強而下降。

宋楚瑜若投入總統大選，顯然是柯文哲與民眾黨極大警訊，而且這已經超乎柯文哲原本號稱手上的三套劇本範疇，加上郭台銘宣告不選、連署日期截止等時間事件，當初的三套劇本壽命幾乎宣告壽終正寢，這時候柯文哲若不及早另行準備好十八套劇本因應，他與民眾黨將隨著老宋參選總統而被邊緣化。
柯文哲最好的劇本當然是與親民黨搭配，當立委提名人的母雞全台努力演出當位好大哥，三不五時還出征到友黨參選選區周遊列國一下，拉抬民眾黨的不分區選票，並與親民黨兄弟登山各自努力政黨票取得2024總統大選參賽入場券；若自己不能出馬受親民黨推薦為正副總統候選人，至少也要派出蔡壁如跟老宋搭檔，沒有大哥，至少有大姊分身搭上母雞列車，扮演同樣的角色。
如果民眾黨沒有人出征總統大選擔任拉抬的母雞角色，剩下就是強化體質。
民眾黨要急速壯大的方式之一是併吞，再者是同盟，唯有不斷進行政黨合作，改善政黨組織與體質，才可能提高政黨自身的亮度，而非只能損耗柯市長自身的光環。可以併吞或同盟的對象很多，例如時代力量、國會政黨聯盟、致公黨、台灣維新黨、喜樂島的呂秀蓮等等都是可積極整合的標的。只是這個方案，亦是親民黨當前為強健體質所積極採取的方式之一。
即將再次出征的老宋，積極整合諸小黨，以眾星拱月力拼兩顆太陽，老驥伏櫪精神賺人熱淚。反觀，如果柯文哲與民眾黨完全不走合盟的路線，沒有母雞拉抬，民眾黨的區域立委與政黨不分區選票的氣勢都會隨著總統選戰日酣而被邊緣化，到時候柯市長再聰明，可能也想不出還有什麼能避免民眾黨萎縮消風的妙招了。

When Soong Chu-yu came, the Taiwan People’s Party will gradually become marginalized.
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by readers


What we want you to know is that Song Zeng cooperated with Ke Wenzhe and also served as an APEC representative of Xiaoying. However, these ""non-blue"" cooperations have allowed the people to support the masses because of the dissatisfaction of water and water. Therefore, ""green"" Ke Wenzhe Ruo Will the cooperation plan with Song be used to prevent Ke Wenzhe from supporting the masses?



Text: Ji Qixiu (sentimental analyst)
The media’s Chairman of the People’s Party, James Soong, will be elected to the President for the fifth time. It is said that the answer seems to be “out of the box”. The People’s Party’s Facebook community’s voice channel “People’s News” recently published four media interviews. Soong Chu-yu emphasized that “the people need a third choice” and they have rushed to attack “hate the DPP” and “hate the National (Yo) Party”. The spokesperson's battle is obviously the same goal as Ke Wenzhe thinks.
And if you want to be on the throne of the boss, is it active or passive? From a historical point of view, it seems that passive landing is a relatively high score. In the far, there is Zhao Wei’s Huang Pao, and there are many elders who have persuaded the elders to ""reluctantly participate"" in the election. The passive conditions of Ke Wenzhe and the Liberal Party seem to be inadequate, and it is better to actively integrate other organizations of the third force.
In essence, the key to the status and strength of the third power brother is whether it can integrate the third forces outside the two parties, and it is called the other ""political hills"" of the name - whether it is Ke Wenzhe or James Soong. In recent years, the contact with the small party is not too small, and compared to Ke Wenzhe's chip is obviously more abundant than James Soong, because behind him there is a huge resource of the entire Taipei city government to allocate dispatch, James Soong has only vice president, 1 -3 seats are not partitioned and the legislature can be exchanged, and the cold is mixed.
Therefore, although James Soong has a presidential ticket, Ke Wenzhe is not in the party that integrates the disadvantages of the small party.
According to the beautiful island electronic newspaper poll on October 29, the mass base of Ke Wenzhe and the Liberal Party mostly fell into the green block, which made the question of whether the ""People's Party should cooperate with the Pan-Blue camp's James Soong"" is even more intriguing. In the past, Song was called ""orange green"" because of cooperation with Ke Wenzhe. He also served as an APEC representative of Xiaoying. Song and these non-blue objects on the same line stood on the same line, so that the original supporters were not satisfied with the soil. Oil and water are separated, so this time, no matter what the situation, whether it is cooperating with others, it must be the recommendation of the People First Party to let the People First Party return to the spectrum of the pan-blue.
Therefore, if Ke Wenzhe adopts a cooperation plan, will it instead let Ke Wenzhe’s supporters be dissatisfied and separated? Let Ke powder fall back to Xiaoying, or Joy Island, one country, the Green Party, Shili and other small party arms? Even led to the vacancy of Ke Wenzhe and the Liberal Party? In either case, the support of the future CPP will definitely decline because of the increased activities of the PFP.

If Song Chuyu enters the presidential election, it is obviously a great warning for Ke Wenzhe and the Liberal Party, and this is beyond the scope of the three sets of scripts that Ke Wenzhe originally claimed. In addition, Guo Taiming’s announcement of no election, the date of the appointment, and other events, the original three sets. The life of the script is almost declared dead. At this time, if Ke Wenzhe prepares 18 sets of scripts in advance, he and the Liberal Party will be marginalized with the election of the old Song.
Ke Wenzhe’s best script is of course matched with the People’s Party. When the legislator’s nominee’s hen is working hard to perform as a good brother, he will also go to the Friends’ Party in the constituency to tour the country and pull the people’s party. Do not divide the ballots, and work with the People First Party brothers to climb the political party votes to obtain the 2024 presidential election entry ticket; if you can not be recommended by the People First Party as the vice presidential candidate, at least send Caibi as a partner with the old Song, no big brother, at least There is a big scorpion to take the hen train and play the same role.
If the Liberal Party does not have a presidential election to serve as a hen role, the rest is to strengthen the physique.
One of the ways in which the Patriotic Party wants to grow rapidly is to annex it. In addition, it is an alliance. Only by continuously cooperating with political parties and improving party organization and physique can it increase the brightness of the party itself, instead of only losing the aura of the mayor. There are many objects that can be annexed or allied, such as the power of the times, the coalition of the congressional parties, the Zhi Gong Dang, the Taiwan Reform Party, and the Lu Xiulian of the Joy Island, etc., which are all actively integrated. This is just one of the ways that the PFP is actively adopting for a strong constitution.
The old Song, who is about to re-enter the levy, actively integrates the small parties and fights the two suns with the stars and the old spirits. On the other hand, if Ke Wenzhe and the Patriotic Party do not follow the line of the alliance and there is no hen to pull up, the momentum of the Liberal Party’s regional legislators and political parties not to divide the votes will be marginalized with the president’s election campaign. The mayor is smarter, and may not think of any other coup that can prevent the popular party from shrinking.

Looking back at the previous presidential elections, Ke Wenzhe’s president’s road has to be mirrored by James Soong.


The ticket to the People First Party presidential election is not as good as Wang Jinping.
