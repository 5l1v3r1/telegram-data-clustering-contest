      <p>DETROIT (AP) - Documents released this week by a federal agency raise questions about whether a self-driving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> SUV that ran down a pedestrian last year should have been allowed on public roads for test purposes.</p>
      <p>A report from the National Transportation Safety Board on a 2018 crash that killed an Arizona woman found that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a>’s self-driving system didn’t consider jaywalkers. It also had trouble figuring out whether the woman was a pedestrian, vehicle, bicycle or other object.</p>
      <p>Experts say that could mean more regulation is needed before testing is allowed on public roads.</p>

        <p>The board will determine the cause of the crash and make safety recommendations at a meeting in Washington on Nov. 19.</p>
