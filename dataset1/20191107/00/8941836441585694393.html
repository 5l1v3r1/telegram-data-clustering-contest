      <p>TULSA, Okla. (AP) - A Republican lawmaker from Oklahoma has abandoned his effort to rename a stretch of Route 66 after President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>State Sen. Nathan Dahm told the Tulsa World on Wednesday that he’s done trying to rename the 4-mile (6.44-kilometer) stretch of the iconic highway in northeastern Oklahoma after Trump.</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma Route 66 Association and Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell both swiftly rejected naming sections of Route 66 after Trump or any other political figure.</p>
      <p>Pinnell, who oversees Oklahoma’s marketing and branding, and others have been working to establish the route of the former U.S. 66 for tourism. Pinnell says a “uniform branding” will soon be rolled out.</p>
      <p>State Rep. Ben Loring, who represents the district where the proposed stretch of highway is located, says it could have adversely impacted tourism.</p>
