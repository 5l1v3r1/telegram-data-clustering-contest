民主黨的「法院重組」難題：小羅斯福曾試圖增加大法官人數，可惜未能如願

在2020民主黨總統初選中，候選人意見分歧的議題之一，就是未來是否應該要增加美國最高法院的法官人數，還是應該要廢止最高法院大法官的終身任期。
這個主題在俄亥俄州的哥倫布、威斯特維爾的郊區小鎮，星期二的民主黨初選辯論中被直接提及，來自CNN的主持人艾琳．伯奈特（Erin Burnett）問了前副總統拜登（Joe Biden），若羅訴韋德案（Roe v. Wade）的判例被推翻，他是否願意試著在最高法院增加法官人數來「保護女人的生育權」。
拜登重申了他對法院重組（court packing ）方案的反對，「最高法院會失去他們現有的信譽」，而前住房與城市發展部（Housing and Urban Development）部長朱利安．卡斯楚（Julián Castro）則說他對於改變大法官任期的計畫保持開放的態度，印地安納州南灣的市長皮特．布塔加智（Pete Buttigieg）則提出要增加大法官的席次，從現有的9名增加到15名，並指出其中5名大法官的任命必須要其他大法官的一致同意。
如同時代雜誌之前所報導的，法院重組已成為了下一個「民主黨的大議題」，因為現在最高法院的9名大法官中，有5名是共和黨總統提名，而只有4名是民主黨總統提名的，而民權、移民與槍枝管制等影響深遠的大案子，又要在相當激烈的總統大選年進行判決。
憲法並沒有規定大法官只能有9個人，這讓這樣的改革方案擁有可行性，但民主黨過往在試圖重組法院上，也有著複雜的歷史，其中，最有名的就是小羅斯福（Franklin Delano Roosevelt）總統試圖實踐布塔加智的計畫，也就是擴大大法官的人數到15人的嘗試，但這顯然並沒有成功。
在1936年，小羅斯福剛贏得他的第二個任期而感到所向無敵，認為這場大勝代表了美國人喜歡他採用「新政」（New Deal ）來對抗大蕭條的政策，但是，雖然美國人買單了「新政」，但是保守傾向的最高法院並沒有為此買單。在他第一任期的尾聲，大法官認為部分「新政」中增加政府對經濟管制的法律和紐約州規定婦女與兒童基本工資的法律違憲，而撤銷了它們。這樣的情況掀起了大眾對「新政」中的社會立法是否能夠繼續施行的疑慮。
就像他在大蕭條時採取了激烈的措施如「新政」來擴張政府權力一樣，小羅斯福認為他也可以採取激烈的措施來讓他的「新政」持續施行，即使這意味著換掉大法官也一樣。
在1937年2月，小羅斯福支持了《1937年司法程序改革法》（Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937），此法稱因為司法部門的案件量過大以至於其處理進度已嚴重落後，總統可以在大法官超過70歲時為最高法院增加一名法官，而增加的人數以6人為限。小羅斯福尚且指出，增加大法官的人數曾有先例，《1789年司法條例》（Judiciary Act of 1789）設定了最高法院大法官的人數為6名，但在1807年增為7名、在1837增為9名，而在1863年增為10名，而在1860年代末，大法官的人數則為8名，直到1869年將大法官的人數改回9名，而這個人數也延續至今。
「身體上與精神上的活力減低會讓一個人避免去檢驗複雜與變化的情勢」，小羅斯福在1937年2月5日寄給國會法案草案時的附帶聲明中說到，「逐漸的，隨著老花眼鏡越緊貼一個人的臉頰，新的事實就越模糊，就像現在一樣。假設目前的情勢與過去一樣的老人，停止他們去探索、調查現在與未來情勢的腳步。」
這份聲明對其他政府機構與媒體來說是非常震驚的，時代雜誌在1937年2月15日的刊號形容了各界的反應：
就像他在其他重要政策（而這是目前最大的）上一樣，小羅斯福再一次的驚訝了全國。震驚的國會議員匆匆的衝進國會，發現這個跟流言一樣的消息居然是真的。證券交易所的新聞跑馬燈不斷的撥放這個消息，而股票市場因此而暴跌。這個消息佔據了所有報紙的頭條與所有的看板。美國與其說是很驚訝，不如說是被震驚了。只有最狂熱的「新政」支持者的某些報紙公開讚揚了這樣的計畫，通常支持小羅斯福政府的獨立媒體，如紐約時報，則一反之前的態度，嚴厲的指出「小羅斯福在最高法院案子上所展現的機敏與聰明並不是一般清醒的公民會讚賞的特質」，斯克里普斯霍華德基金會（Scripps-Howard）的編輯則寫道，「雖然這個行為沒有比前總統格蘭特（Ulysses Grant）試圖在最高法院加入兩名成員，以通過他的《法定貨幣法》（legal tender law）的行為來的原始粗暴，但是小羅斯福的提案在政治上來看，是為了達成一樣的目的。正因為這個目的如此的明顯而刺眼，總統必須為這個議題走向情緒之爭而負大部分責任。」總統的訊息雖然很清楚，也就是為了更好的政府，司法部門需要改變，但是他的提案卻讓人懷疑他有不可告人的動機。讓他更改目前大法官的人數或替換目前的大法官，以為他的「新政」增加法律基礎，這個理由很顯然是相當牽強的。
首席大法官查爾斯（Charles Evans Hughes）寫了一封信抨擊了這份提案，在1937年6月，參議院司法委員會將此法案送到參議院大會給全體參議員進行投票，並建議投下否定票，稱此法案是「在美國從未被嘗試過的，對司法權的侵犯」，而「維持我國憲政民主所必須的，就是司法部門完全獨立於行政與立法部門之外」。當年7月，參議院以70比20的比數將此法案退回了委員會，要求將法院重組的條款從法案中除去。
小羅斯福決定另闢蹊徑，試圖「清黨」，支持黨內主要不支持他「新政」部分政策的9位參議員的對手，但這樣的手段也失敗了，這9人都贏得了選舉，這成為了總統要影響國會選舉結果的重要教訓，總統的影響力是有限的，特別是要挑戰那些現任而要追求連任者時。
雖然法院重組的法案被留在委員會，但是保留「新政」的方向已經逐漸被確定了。
當年春天，最高法院的判決支持了華盛頓州的最低薪資法，以及另外兩個「新政」最重要的法律，也就是《社會保障法》（Social Security Act）與《全國勞工關係法》（National Labor Relations Act），保守傾向的大法官歐文．羅伯茲（Owen Roberts）一開始想投下反對票，但他沒有，他的轉向被稱為「拯救9人席次的即時轉向」，一年後，一些學者如威廉．勞易登保格（William Leuchtenburg）都猜測， 「法院重組的法案所帶來的壓力可能是非常強大而有影響力的」，其他學者則稱大法官歐文早就已經在心裡決定好了，而他的這票也符合他過往的一些決定。
無論如何，增加大法官席次這個想法的污名依然留了下來。
也不是所有民主黨任命的大法官都同意2020民主黨初選候選人擴大法院的想法。露絲．拜德．金斯伯格（Ruth Bader Ginsburg），柯林頓1993年提名的大法官，就在7月的訪問中說到，小羅斯福在1937年增加大法官的想法是個「壞主意」，而在80年後這依然是，因為增加的法官會讓最高法院看起來更與政黨政治有關。

The ""reorganization of the court"" of the Democratic Party: Roosevelt tried to increase the number of judges, but unfortunately failed to do so.
07 Nov 2019, 00:25 by TIME
Text: Olivia B. Waxman translation: Zeng Shizhen
In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, one of the topics of disagreement among candidates is whether the number of judges in the US Supreme Court should be increased in the future, or whether the life of the Supreme Court justice should be abolished.
The theme was directly mentioned in the Democratic primary election debate in Columbus, Westville, Ohio, on Tuesday, from CNN host Irene. Erin Burnett asked former Vice President Joe Biden, if Roe v. Wade's jurisprudence was overturned, would he be willing to try to increase the number of judges in the Supreme Court to ""protect"" The reproductive rights of women.""
Biden reiterated his opposition to the court packing program, ""the Supreme Court will lose their existing credibility,"" said Julian, the former Minister of Housing and Urban Development. Julián Castro said that he is open to the plan to change the term of the judge, Mayor of the South Bay of Indiana. Pete Buttigieg proposed to increase the number of seats for the judges from the existing nine to 15, and pointed out that the appointment of five of the judges must be unanimously agreed by other judges.
As Time magazine reported earlier, the reorganization of the court has become the next big issue of the Democratic Party, because now five of the nine judges of the Supreme Court are nominated by the Republican president, and only four are Democrats. The president’s nomination, and the far-reaching big cases such as civil rights, immigration and gun control, must be judged in the fierce presidential election year.
The Constitution does not stipulate that the judge can only have nine people, which makes such a reform plan feasible. However, the Democratic Party has a complicated history in trying to reorganize the court. Among them, the most famous one is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The president tried to practice Butagar’s plan, which is an attempt to expand the number of judges to 15 people, but this has obviously not been successful.
In 1936, Roosevelt just won his second term and felt invincible. He believed that this victory represented the Americans' preference for his ""New Deal"" to fight the Great Depression, but the Americans paid for it. The ""New Deal"", but the conservative Supreme Court did not pay for it. At the end of his first term, the Chancellor ruled that some of the ""New Deal"" added government's laws on economic regulation and the New York State law on women's and children's basic wages unconstitutional, and withdrew them. This situation has raised public concern about whether the social legislation in the ""New Deal"" can continue to be implemented.
Just as he took drastic measures such as the ""New Deal"" to expand government power during the Great Depression, Roosevelt thought he could also take drastic measures to keep his ""New Deal"" going, even if it meant replacing the justice. The same is true.
In February 1937, Roosevelt supported the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which stated that because the amount of cases in the judiciary was so large that its processing progress was seriously behind, the president could be big. When the judge is over 70, he adds a judge to the Supreme Court, and the increase is limited to six. Roosevelt also pointed out that there have been precedents for increasing the number of judges. The Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number of Supreme Court justices to six, but in 1807 it increased to seven and increased in 1837. It was nine, and it increased to 10 in 1863. In the late 1860s, the number of judges was eight. Until 1869, the number of judges was changed back to nine, and this number has continued to this day.
""The reduction in physical and mental vitality will allow one to avoid examining complex and changing situations,"" Roosevelt said in a statement attached to the Congressional bill on February 5, 1937, "" Gradually, with The closer the reading glasses are to a person's cheek, the more blurred the new facts are, as it is now. Suppose the current situation is the same as the old people in the past, stop them from exploring and investigating the current and future situation.""
This statement is very shocking to other government agencies and the media. Time magazine's February 15, 1937 issue described the response from all walks of life:
Just as he was on other important policies (and this is currently the biggest), Roosevelt once again surprised the country. The shocked congressman rushed into the parliament and found that the same news as the rumors was true. The news marquee of the stock exchange kept releasing the news, and the stock market plummeted. This message occupies the headlines of all newspapers and all the billboards. The United States is not so surprised, it is better to be shocked. Only some of the most fanatical ""New Deal"" supporters have publicly praised such plans, often supporting the independent media of the Roosevelt government, such as the New York Times, which is an anti-previous attitude and sternly pointed out that ""Little Roosevelt is in the Supreme Court."" The dexterity and cleverness shown in the case are not the qualities that ordinary sober citizens appreciate,” the editor of Scripps-Howard wrote, “although this act is no better than the former President Grant (Ulysses Grant). ) trying to join two members in the Supreme Court to pass the original legal law of the legal tender law, but Roosevelt’s proposal is politically aimed at achieving the same purpose. The purpose is so obvious and dazzling that the president must take most of the responsibility for this issue to go to the emotional debate. ""The president's message is clear, that is, for a better government, the judiciary needs to change, but his proposal makes People suspect that he has an ulterior motive. It is obviously far-fetched to let him change the current number of judges or replace the current justice to increase the legal basis for his ""New Deal.""
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote a letter to attack the proposal. In June 1937, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent the bill to the Senate to vote for all senators and recommended a negative vote. This bill is ""an infringement of judicial power that has never been tried in the United States"", and ""the only thing necessary to maintain our constitutional democracy is that the judiciary is completely independent of the executive and legislative branches."" In July of that year, the Senate returned the bill to the committee in a 70 to 20 ratio, requesting that the terms of the court reorganization be removed from the bill.
Roosevelt decided to find another way to try to ""clear the party"" and support the opponents of the nine senators who mainly did not support some of his ""New Deal"" policies. But this means also failed. These nine people won the election, which became The president wants to influence the important lessons of the outcome of the congressional elections. The influence of the president is limited, especially when it comes to those who are incumbent and want to pursue re-election.
Although the bill for reorganization of the court was left in the committee, the direction of retaining the ""New Deal"" has gradually been determined.
In the spring of that year, the Supreme Court’s decision supported Washington State’s minimum wage law and the two most important laws of the “New Deal”, namely the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act (National Labor). Relations Act), Conservative Tendency Owen. Owen Roberts wanted to vote against it at first, but he didn't. His turn was called ""the immediate turn to save 9 people."" A year later, some scholars like William. William Leuchtenburg has speculated that ""the pressure from the reorganization of the court may be very powerful and influential,"" other scholars say that Justice Owen has already decided in his heart. His vote is also in line with some of his past decisions.
In any case, the stigma of the idea of increasing the number of judges is still left.
Nor is it that all the Democratic-appointed judges agree with the idea of the 2020 Democratic primary election candidate to expand the court. Ruth. Bader. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton’s 1993 nominee, said in his July interview that Roosevelt’s idea of adding a judge in 1937 was a “bad idea” and in 80 years. This is still the case, because the addition of judges will make the Supreme Court look more relevant to party politics.
