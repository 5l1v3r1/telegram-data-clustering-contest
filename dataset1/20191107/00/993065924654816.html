      <p>Tagging proteins in human cells with a small sugar molecule could help understand neurological diseases, according to a team of scientists in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Professor Daan van Aalten of the University of Dundee’s School of Life Sciences made use of a molecule called O-GlcNAc, which is found on proteins related to conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, motor neurone disease and intellectual disability.</p>
      <p>There are over 20,000 proteins in every human cell and approximately 20% of these contain O-GlcNAc.</p>
      <p>Prof van Aalten’s team hypothesise that increasing levels of the molecule appears to have a therapeutic benefit, leading them to develop a technique to tag proteins and explore what happens.</p>
      <blockquote>I had been working on this problem for several years when a few unexpected observations led me to establish this new method<cite>Dr Andrii Gorelik</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He said: “It is likely that perturbation of the O-GlcNAc sugar on just a single protein could have deleterious effects on healthy neurons and other cells but until recently, the research field lacked methods to investigate this.</p>
      <p>“We have now created the tool that enables us to do this.</p>
      <p>“This allows us to ask questions about the role of specific sugar modifications that are dysregulated in cases of intellectual disability, as well as other brain diseases.</p>
      <p>“Our technique has great potential to advance knowledge of O-GlcNAc-related disorders and help develop novel therapeutics.”</p>
      <p>With additional gene editing technology, the team could use their method to understand the causes of the diseases when the sugar level is disrupted.</p>
      <blockquote>I had been working on this problem for several years when a few unexpected observations led me to establish this new method<cite>Dr Andrii Gorelik</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Dr Andrii Gorelik, lead author of the research, found carbohydrate-protein linkage could be genetically altered to permanently fix the sugar to the protein, allowing it to be studied.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had been working on this problem for several years when a few unexpected observations led me to establish this new method.</p>
      <p>“Because the approach is so simple, it can be used in virtually any biomedical research lab worldwide and, hopefully, result in exciting findings regarding the role of O-GlcNAc in normal physiology and disease.”</p>
      <p>The research was supported by Wellcome Trust funding, with the findings published in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology.</p>
