德國擴大「雙軌式職訓」，不讓大學與工業產業脫鉤
07 Nov 2019, 00:25 by 劉威良


我們想讓你知道的是過去德國的大學與工業產業是脫鉤的，大學生畢業之後就進入自由市場中找工作。而最近幾年來德國大學年制減縮改革，除了把過去大學的碩士，實務性的分為學士與碩士學位，並進一步發展更實用性地職訓升級版的雙軌專業大學學科。



兒子念九年級中學的學校老師來函，告知今（2019）年的職訓與就業博覽會日期，說明學校這次不帶學生去參加，有興趣的父母可以自己帶孩子去。這個職訓與就業博覽會每年都會舉辦一至兩次，目的是要讓正在就讀中學或將畢業的大學生，讓他們知道有什麼合適的工作與職訓機會。而失業者、想更換工作或想再重新進入職場的人，也可以來了解現今各行各業的發展與可能性，並和企業主有直接會談的可能。
這個活動是由本城的勞工局主辦，邀請本城與附近的相關企業主86家企業及職訓單位參加，讓未來要進入職場的學生及尋求或重新進入職場的人，可以在最短的時間認識到現今職場上最需要的職缺。博覽會中也安排演講，詳談各個重要專業領域的趨勢與需求，並為懵懂的青年人介紹與諮詢各項職業與生涯規劃，比如近來德國首重的雙軌式的實務與理論兼具的專業大學學科（Dualen Studium）。
雙軌式職訓與專業大學學科
這種實務與理論兼具的專業大學學科，是德國繼雙軌職訓學習之後的升級版。從過去至今都有的雙軌式職訓，是中學畢業以後，根據自己是九年級基礎中學畢業，還是十年級實用中學畢業的資格來選擇就業的市場，在中學畢業後找到職訓缺，參加兩至三年的職訓學到一技之長，考證照多可順利就業。職訓期間的職訓生可說幾乎是在工作場域工作，一星期大約只有一天要到學校來學習上理論課，並和老師做職訓上的實務交流。學生在職訓中也可主動要求換職訓企業主。中學生畢業的職訓，因為多在企業主的工作場域工作，也就可以拿到大約是未來全薪工作的一半薪水，在第二年與第三年的職訓薪水也會跟著學習得更多而薪資增多。
好的職訓生，在職訓中就會和企業主簽下職訓後成為正式員工的工作契約。這樣一來，一方面企業主可以就職訓生的工作態度了解未來任用的可能性，另一方面，職訓生也可以在職訓中認識與實作此項工作，從而了解企業的精神與要求，是否符合將來性向與所需。

從職訓延展升級的專業大學學科，是因應德國工業近來大量需求專業技術人士所發展出來的。德國是高科技的工業國家，工業上所需求的人才，很多是應用科學的研發工程師，他們的人才大多要從大學來找。過去德國的大學與工業產業是脫鉤的，大學生畢業之後就進入自由市場中找工作。而最近幾年來德國大學年制減縮改革，除了把過去大學的碩士，實務性的分為學士與碩士學位，並進一步發展更實用性地職訓升級版的雙軌專業大學學科。
這種專業大學學科也像德國取得學士學位一樣是三年半的時間。專業大學學科的學習時間一半要在企業工作場域，一半的時間是在課堂上學習理論課程。要唸此學科的前提，必須要有上大學的資格，也就是要考過類似台灣的指考，依據考試的成績申請學科。有考過大學資格考的學生必須有十二年學習或是中學畢業後有通過職訓二到三年的學習，才能上大學。
對於比較晚發展的年輕人，他們早期在學校成績可能不盡人意，中學畢業九或十年級以後，還是可以再補念兩年的專業中學，畢業之後考大學資格考，也可以完成要進入大學的夢想。
而在中學畢業之後做職訓完成的人，如果在就業之後還想回到大學唸書，學校會承認他職訓的年資，所以只要再補唸一年的職業中學，畢業後考過念大學的資格考，即可唸大學。
企業獵人頭
本次的職訓與就業博覽會，齊聚本城與鄰近各地的各大企業，包括製造汽車的名廠奧迪與相關產業、德鐵與本城最大教學醫院等，但也有一般人比較陌生的工作如警察、軍人與監獄看管犯人的工作人員，他們都出來擺攤獵人頭。
社會工作的職場上，與世界各國一樣最缺護理人員。護理人員也分成專業人員的養成三年及助理人員養成一年的職訓。另外還有在職場繼續進修的各項技能訓練的機構，包括外語與德語學習的語言學校。這些機構也是勞工局出資讓求職者免費進修的合作機構，根據求職者的需求與技能，讓他們失業時可以充電，充實自己的技能，以便在職場上盡快找到自己事業的第二春。

Germany expands ""double-track vocational training"" to prevent university from decoupling from industrial industry
07 Nov 2019, 00:25 by Liu Weiliang


What we want you to know is that in the past Germany's universities were decoupled from the industrial industry. After graduating, college students entered the free market to find jobs. In recent years, the annual system of the German university has been reduced. In addition to the master's degree in the past, the practice is divided into bachelor's and master's degrees, and further develops a more practical vocational training upgraded version of the dual-track professional university discipline.



The son of the school teacher in the ninth grade middle school sent a letter to inform the date of the vocational training and employment fair in this (2019) year, indicating that the school did not bring students to participate this time, and interested parents could take their children. This Vocational Training and Employment Expo is held once or twice a year to educate college students who are attending or will graduate, to let them know about the right job and vocational training opportunities. Unemployed people who want to change jobs or want to re-enter the workplace can also learn about the developments and possibilities of all walks of life and have direct talks with business owners.
This event was hosted by the Labor Bureau of the city and invited the city and 86 related companies and vocational training units to participate in the event, so that students who want to enter the workplace in the future and those who seek or re-enter the workplace can know in the shortest time. The most needed job in the workplace today. The exhibition also arranged speeches to discuss the trends and needs of various important professional fields, and to introduce and consult various career and career plans for ignorant young people, such as Germany’s first dual-track practice and theory. Discipline (Dualen Studium).
Dual-track vocational training and professional university disciplines
This kind of professional university discipline with both practice and theory is an upgraded version of Germany after the study of dual-track vocational training. The double-track vocational training that has been in the past is the market that chooses employment after graduating from high school according to whether it is a ninth grade basic high school or a tenth grade practical middle school. After graduating from high school, I found a job shortage and participated in two. After three years of professional training, I learned a skill, and I can successfully apply for a photo. The vocational training students during the vocational training can be said to work almost in the field of work. There is only one day in a week to go to the school to study the theoretical class, and to communicate with the teacher on the practical training. Students can also take the initiative to ask for change of training business owners in the vocational training. The vocational training for middle school students, because they work in the workplace of the business owner, can get about half of the salary for the full-time salary in the future. In the second and third year, the salary will be learned more. More and more salary.
A good job trainer will become a work contract for a formal employee after signing a vocational training with the business owner in the vocational training. In this way, on the one hand, the business owner can understand the possibility of future appointments. On the other hand, the vocational training students can also understand and implement this work in the vocational training, so as to understand the spirit and requirements of the enterprise. Whether it meets future sexual orientation and needs.

The professional university disciplines that have been extended from vocational training have been developed in response to the recent demand from the German industry for a large number of professional and technical personnel. Germany is a high-tech industrial country. Many of the talents needed in industry are R&D engineers in applied sciences. Most of their talents are from universities. In the past, universities in Germany were decoupled from the industrial industry. After graduating, college students entered the free market to find jobs. In recent years, the annual system of the German university has been reduced. In addition to the master's degree in the past, the practice is divided into bachelor's and master's degrees, and further develops a more practical vocational training upgraded version of the dual-track professional university discipline.
This professional university discipline is also like a German bachelor's degree for three and a half years. Half of the study time of a professional university subject is in the field of corporate work, and half of the time is to study theoretical courses in the classroom. To read the premise of this subject, you must have the qualification to go to college, that is, you must take a test similar to Taiwan, and apply for a subject based on the results of the test. Students who have passed the university qualification examination must have 12 years of study or two or three years of vocational training after they graduate from high school.
For younger people who are late in development, their early school performance may be unsatisfactory. After graduating from the 9th or 10th grade in high school, they can still take two years of professional secondary school. After graduation, they can take the university qualification test, or they can complete the university. dream.
Those who have completed their vocational training after graduating from high school, if they want to go back to college after employment, the school will recognize the seniority of his vocational training, so he only needs to re-take the vocational middle school for one year, and then take the university after graduation. Qualification test, you can go to college.
Corporate hunter head
This vocational training and employment fair gathered in the city and neighboring major enterprises, including the famous automobile manufacturing factory Audi and related industries, the German railway and the largest teaching hospital in the city, but also the unfamiliar work of ordinary people. The police, military and prison guards the prisoners’ staff, and they all came out to set up the hunter’s head.
In the workplace of social work, as with the rest of the world, the most lack of nursing staff. Nursing staff are also divided into three years of professional development and one year of assistant training. There are also various skills training institutions that continue to pursue further education in the workplace, including language schools for foreign languages and German language learning. These institutions are also the cooperation agencies funded by the Office for job seekers to study for free. According to the needs and skills of job seekers, they can recharge and enrich their skills when they are unemployed, so as to find the second spring of their career in the workplace as soon as possible.
