Taking Stock: Booster plan for real estate, US-China trade truce help Sensex hit new high, Nifty ends above 12K
In terms of sectors, the action was seen in energy, metal, realty, and consumer durable sector while profit-taking was visible in the public sector, oil & gas, capital goods, and auto index.

07 Nov 2019

The Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,688 on an intraday basis, while the Nifty50 closed above 12,000 level for the first time since June 2019. Investors sentiment bolstered on the back of progress in US-China trade talks and a booster dose by the government for the real estate sector.
The Nifty50 is now just 91 points away from its record high of 12,103.
The final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 183 points to 40,653 while the Nifty50 rallied 46 points to close at 12,012. Sensex ended at fresh record closing high on Thursday.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on November 7 said the government will put in Rs 10,000 crore in the recently announced alternative investment fund (AIF) while State Bank of India and LIC would provide Rs 15,000 crore, taking the total revival package to Rs 25,000 crore.
The market took comfort in the fact that the proposed plan is better than the earlier one and more such measures could be in the offing to support the economy and revive investor sentiment.
""The proposed AIF is better than the earlier one since this also includes projects referred to NCLT,” Dr VK Vijaykumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Service told Moneycontrol.
“This will be beneficial not only to the stressed real estate sector but also to the home finance and NBFCs which have lent to developers. The announcement also sends the signal that more economic reforms are in the offing,” he said.
Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on November 7 said the central bank is closely monitoring the scam-hit PMC Bank situation and a forensic audit is underway. He also added that the RBI is closely monitoring non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
On the global front, China and the United States have agreed to cancel, in phases, the tariffs imposed during their prolonged trade war, Reuters said in a report, quoting the Chinese commerce ministry.
In terms of sectors, the action was seen in energy, metal, realty, and consumer durable sector while profit-taking was visible in the public sector, oil & gas, capital goods, and auto index.
