      <p>BROOKHAVEN, Miss. (AP) - A Mississippi public school district says it has been the victim of a cyber attack.</p>
      <p>Lincoln County Schools superintendent Mickey Myers told The Daily Leader on Monday that district computers had been hacked with a ransomware virus.</p>
      <p>The newspaper reports that officials said the district was experiencing a network outage affecting phone systems and internet communication at its schools. Myers said “numerous agencies” were assisting in the investigation. He didn’t say if the FBI would be joining.</p>
      <p>The FBI explains that ransomware is a malicious software that can lock users out of computer systems, among other issues. Hackers usually demand payment in order to restore access to the system.</p>
