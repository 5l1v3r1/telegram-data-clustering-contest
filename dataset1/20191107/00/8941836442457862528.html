      <p>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanley-cup/">The Stanley Cup</a> champion <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis-blues/">St. Louis Blues</a> are rolling again.</p>
      <p>Alex Pietrangelo had a goal and two assists and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis/">St. Louis</a> remained atop the Western Conference standings, beating the second-place <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Edmonton Oilers</a> 5-2 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory.</p>
      <p>Jaden Schwartz, Robert Thomas, Tyler Bozak and Ivan Barbashev also scored to help <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis/">St. Louis</a> tie Washington for the overall NHL lead with 25 points.</p>
      <p>“We just find a way to get it done,” said Thomas, whose team had won its previous three outings in overtime. “We’re winning a lot of 2-1, 3-2 games and close games at the end. I think that shows our character and being able fight until the end and get some wins.”</p>
      <p>Jake Allen made 32 saves to improve to 3-1 on the season.</p>

      <p>“I’ve felt like I’ve been getting better every game to be honest than at the start of the year,” Allen said. “I felt a lot more comfortable and it felt good to get a lot of action and obviously it was good to get the win and the guys battled hard.”</p>
      <p>Connor McDavid and Zack Kassian scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a>. They have lost two in a row.</p>
      <p>“This was a lesson for us,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> defenseman Oscar Klefbom said. “This was a playoff game and obviously we have a long way to go. We have to find a way to win these games because there are going to be many of them this year. We’re going to play a lot of good teams and we have to be ready. They played last night, we gave them a little bit too much and it cost us.”</p>
      <p>Leon Draisaitl extended his points streak to seven games with a feed to McDavid, who tucked his eighth goal of the season through the legs of goalie Jake Allen, to open scoring on a power play 2:46 into the game. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis/">St. Louis</a> responded with a power-play goal of its own six minutes into the first when Schwartz tipped Pietrangelo’s point shot past Mike Smith.</p>

        <p>Pietrangelo’s long-range shot got past Smith 7 minutes into the second period on another power play. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/st-louis/">St. Louis</a> added to its lead with 5 minutes remaining in the middle period when Thomas beat Smith to the glove side.</p>
        <p>Draisaitl picked up another assist with 9 minutes left when he sent a long feed to Kassian.</p>
        <p>Bozak’s short-handed empty-net goal went into the net on a lucky bounce before Barbashev added another short-handed empty-netter.</p>
