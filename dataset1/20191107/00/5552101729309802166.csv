刑事局破獲黑幫合作販毒案！具有黑幫身分的郭姓、卓姓主嫌，在新北市承租大樓掩人耳目，作為毒品存放場所。刑事局研判，這個犯罪集團疑似將市價3億元、118萬顆的三級毒品一粒眠銷往馬來西亞，蒐證後搗破毒窟，阻止毒品流入市面。



10月21日，刑事局偵三大隊會同新北市蘆洲分局、新莊分局和台北市士林分局、台北市刑大等單位，前往新北市五股區的一處大樓進行攻堅，當場查獲26歲郭嫌、35歲卓嫌及另外2名販毒共犯，查扣217公斤的一粒眠共24箱、118萬顆，還在房間衣櫥內起出火藥式手槍3把、消音器1支、彈匣2個、手槍子彈103顆、霰彈槍子彈21顆，及2輛運毒轎車等贓證物。

專案小組指出，去年8月間與馬來西亞警方合作，在基隆港截獲偽裝成「活餌箱」的一粒眠毒品400公斤、160萬顆，市價約8億元，並持續追查毒源及幕後集團。調查發現，具有竹聯幫、四海幫背景的郭嫌與卓嫌，是登記在案的毒品人口，因此展開跟監蒐證。
專案小組表示，住在新北市三重區的郭嫌等人，從今年5月起在新北市五股區承租社區大樓，研判是作為毒品儲存倉庫；10月中旬時掌握，卓嫌駕駛貨車將24個可疑的紙箱，在路邊交付駕駛休旅車的郭嫌，載運至承租的大樓內藏放。

警方表示，一粒眠的成分為第三級毒品硝甲西泮及第四級毒品硝西泮，是毒咖啡包的重要原料之一，在台灣的市價每顆約250元，銷往國外可獲利一倍左右。粗估每顆一粒眠可製作3包毒咖啡包，查獲的118萬顆約可製作350萬包，幸虧及時攔截，否則將毒害社會。
警方訊後將郭、卓2嫌和2名同夥移送新北地檢署偵辦，郭、卓遭檢方聲押獲准，另外2人各以3萬元、5萬元交保候傳。

The Criminal Bureau cracked the gang's cooperation drug trafficking case! Guo Xing and Zhuo Xing, who have gangster status, are suspected of being in a rented building in New Taipei City as a drug storage place. The Criminal Bureau judged that the criminal group suspected that the market price of 300 million yuan and 1.18 million third-class drugs would be sold to Malaysia. After the test, the drug was broken and the drug was prevented from flowing into the market.



On October 21st, the Criminal Bureau's three major battalions met with the Luzhou Branch of Xinbei City, the Xinzhuang Branch, the Taipei Shilin Branch, and the Taipei City Penal Division, and went to a building in the Wusheng District of New Taipei City to attack and seize 26 on the spot. Aged Guo suspected, 35-year-old Zhuo suspect and two other drug-trafficking accomplices, seized 217 kilograms of a total of 24 boxes of sleep, 1.18 million, also in the room closet, three gunpowder-type pistols, one silencer, There are 2 magazines, 103 pistol bullets, 21 shotgun bullets, and 2 vehicle poisoning cars.

The ad hoc group pointed out that in August last year, in cooperation with the Malaysian police, 400 kilograms of a sleeping drug disguised as a ""live bait box"" was seized in Keelung Port, with a market price of about 800 million yuan, and the drug source and behind-the-scenes group continued to be traced. The investigation found that Guo suspected and Zhuo suspect, who had the background of Zhulian Gang and Sihaibang, was the registered drug population, so he began to conduct a surveillance with the supervisor.
The ad hoc group said that Guo suspect and others living in Sanchong District of New Taipei City have been renting a community building in Wusheng District of New Taipei City since May this year. They are judged as a drug storage warehouse; they will be mastered in mid-October. A suspicious carton, which was delivered to the rented building by the roadside, was transported to the rented building.

The police said that the composition of a sleeping drug is the third-class drug nimetazepam and the fourth-grade drug, nitricepsin, which is one of the important raw materials for poisonous coffee bags. The market price in Taiwan is about 250 yuan per piece, which can be sold abroad. The profit is about doubled. A rough estimate of each can make 3 packs of toxic coffee bags, and the 1.18 million seized can make 3.5 million packs. Fortunately, timely interception will poison the society.
After the police, Guo and Zhuo 2 and two accomplices were transferred to the New North District Inspection Office for investigation. Guo and Zhuo were accused by the prosecution. The other two were paid 30,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan each.
