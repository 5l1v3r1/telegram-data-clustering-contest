Upadhye said the sales of its key product, a generic called Sensipar, has witnessed a price erosion in Q2 due to competition, however the company has maintained its market share.
Upadhye indicated that the further dip in the contribution from generic Sensipar will be offset by new limited-competition launches and strong traction in the recently launched generic Pregabalin and gradual traction of antibiotic Daptomycin injection.
Cipla reported sales of $135 million in the US, of which Sensipar accounted for $15-20 million, as analyst estimates.
Cipla also stated that the launch of asthma drug inhaler Albuterol is likely to be delayed by a quarter owing to the inclusion of a dose counter in the device by the innovator. Now, the filing of the generic Advair is expected in early part of calendar year 2020.
The Phase III trial readout and the subsequent filing for IV Tramadol, the approval for the generic Proventil, and a filing for the generic Advair are expected to be the key catalysts in FY21E.
The management guided for a 200 basis points improvement in the tax rate in FY21 as it opts for the new tax rates from FY21E. The company expect to incur tax outgo of 29-30 percent in FY20.
