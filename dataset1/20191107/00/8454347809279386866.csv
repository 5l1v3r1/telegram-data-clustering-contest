New Apple TV+ series For All Mankind portrays an alternate history in which the U.S. space program triumphs in defeat after the Russians land on the moon first. Executive producers and co-creators Ronald D. Moore, Matt Wolpert, and Ben Nedivi and executive producer Maril Davis provide insight into their new drama ahead of the November 8 premiere of episode four, “Prime Crew,” in which a training accident sparks a debate about women astronauts.

About the show: 

For All Mankind presents an aspirational world where NASA astronauts, engineers and their families find themselves in the center of extraordinary events seen through the prism of an alternate history timeline — a world in which the USSR beats the U.S. to the moon. The series stars Joel Kinnaman, Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel VanSanten, Wrenn Schmidt, Jodi Balfour. For All Mankind is  directed by Seth Gordon.
