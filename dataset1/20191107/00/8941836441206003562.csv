LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Trump tried to sniff out corruption
07 Nov 2019 by THE WASHINGTON TIMES

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

How ironic — the day Andrew P. Napolitano’s op-ed (“Would Roosevelt have made a Trumpian demand with a world leader?” Web, Nov. 6) which basically accuses President Trump of a crime, is printed in The Times, the front page leads with the headline, “Legal scholars see no ‘quid pro quo’ crime.” In reading these two pieces one can plainly see just how politically partisan this entire episode is.
For Democrats and Never Trumpers (like the judge and columnist Peggy Noonan), it’s all about digging up “dirt” on your political opponent. For “legal scholars,” it’s about the president’s duty to uphold the law in rooting out possible corruption by a previous U.S. vice president who just happens to be running for president for the opposition party.
Let’s call the whole thing off.
