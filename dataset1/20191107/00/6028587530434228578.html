      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/lululemon-athletica/">Lululemon Athletica Inc.</a> (NASDAQ: LULU), the Canadian athletic apparel retailer, is one of the fastest-growing apparel companies in the world. The company’s healthy lifestyle-inspired athletic apparel and accessories have helped the company achieve strong growth over the last few years. Moreover, this growth has been aided by new store-openings and a steady increase in comparable-store sales as well as e-commerce sales across the U.S. and Canada. While the company’s retail business has flourished, Lululemon’s Direct-To-Consumer segment has been the single largest contributor to growth over recent years. Trefis highlights the <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/a2kFcXla/What-Is-The-Importance-Of-Direct-To-Consumer-DTC-Segment-To-Lululemon-?fromforbesandarticle=lulu191107"><b>importance of its DTC segment to Lululemon </b></a>in an interactive dashboard, and also details why the segment will remain key to growth in <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/RibFuG4e/Lululemon-Valuation-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=lulu191107">Lululemon’s valuation</a> over coming years. </p>

        <b>
          <i>#1 DTC Segment Contributes More Than 25% Of Lululemon’s Revenues</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>DTC segment has achieved robust growth in the last few years, with revenues more than doubling from $400 million in 2015 to roughly $860 million in FY 2018</li>
        <li>This growth can be attributed to an increase in traffic on e-commerce websites, improved conversion rates and increased dollar value per transaction.</li>
        <li>We expect DTC revenues to continue their growth trajectory – increasing at a rate of 23% to $1.05 billion in FY 2019.</li>
        <li>With increased digitization and higher traffic on the company’s website and mobile apps, the contribution of digital sales to total revenue is expected to cross 28% in 2019.</li>
      </ul>

          <i>#4 Finally, the DTC Segment Has Been Operating At A Higher Margin Too</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As of 2018, the DTC segment’s operating margin was 41% – well above Lululemon’s total adjusted operating margin of 30%</li>
