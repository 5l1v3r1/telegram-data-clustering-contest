07 Nov 2019, 00:30 by 熊景玉, 楊兆元
號稱「大哥專業戶」的王識賢演出改編自真人真事的電影《樂園》，詮釋一位戒毒成功，並開設了有機農場幫助其他誤入歧途的少年戒毒的更生人。王識賢在片中毒癮發作難熬，他回憶那場戲拍了2小時，整個人在堅硬的地上扭動，拍完自己也虛脫了。
王識賢為了詮釋戒毒成功的更生人，曾經親自訪問主角原型，對方告訴他，由於毒癮上來實在太痛苦，只好用自殘等更痛苦的方式逼自己轉移注意力。他在演這場戲時，劇本沒有指示他要怎麼演，他只有憑自己想像在地上扭動。他笑說地上很硬，一拍就是2小時，他拍完全身痛，體力也耗盡，整個人快虛脫。
但另一場他與入圍本屆新人獎的原騰的對手戲更辛苦，劇情描述原騰毒癮發作，他要按住原騰不讓他自殘，兩人有激烈扭打，王識賢回憶拍攝前雖然有先設定好動線，但正式來時卻完全不是那回事，才25歲的原騰力氣又大，王識賢形容他「像頭牛一般」，按都按不住，加上兩人身上又都是汗，有次一個手滑沒抓住他，讓原騰一頭撞到桌腳。


王識賢扮演戒毒成功的更生人，他表示演完該片後感覺背負重大使命，希望能傳遞正面訊息。

戲中王識賢有個正值青春期的女兒，但父女關係惡劣，真實生活裡王識賢也有兩個分別就讀國三與小六的女兒。他表示以前有人問他：「願意等女兒長大後買法拉利給她，還是在她小時候當馬讓她騎？」王識賢說，他寧願在女兒小時候就當馬讓她騎，給家庭與孩子多點時間陪伴，才不會因為錯過孩子的成長而後悔。
電影劇情描述王識賢飾演的「華哥」早年沉淪毒海，成功戒毒後開設了有機農場，專門收留也犯了毒癮的青少年，幫助他們藉助宗教及勞動力量戒毒。導演廖士涵透露，該片角色都「有所本」，除了「華哥」外，藍葦華的角色也是真有其人，在離開農場後半年就因繼續吸毒酗酒而暴斃。王識賢也說，以往他的角色都是只關注個人，這次他覺得自己學會感恩，也背負了使命，如今面向較一般角色更寬廣，希望能透過電影向社會傳遞正面訊息。


原騰入圍本屆金馬獎最佳新演員，導演廖士涵因此為他掛上彩帶祝他得獎。

而6日晚間《樂園》也舉辦了首映，該片未正式上映全台已售出近兩百萬的預售票。首映會現場導演為因此片入圍金馬獎最佳新演員的原騰掛上「勇奪金馬」的披肩帶預祝奪獎，而男主角王識賢則送上用樂高做的「金馬獎座」，除了希望原騰月底可以拿真的獎座，更希望「樂」園開出「高」票房。王識賢說：『也許大家看到的是原騰的幸運，但我絕對要肯定他的努力，他為了戲可以不睡覺、抽煙抽到吐、勤學台語，讓人看了很感動，入圍金馬獎絕對實至名歸。』
而從幕後轉戰幕前演戲的原騰，除了演技獲肯定，未來也想嘗試當導演，拍讓大家看了開心的喜劇，還邀廖士涵導演當顧問，而王識賢一聽馬上改口說：「導演您好，下一部戲再麻煩你了，我不是只會演大哥，我也很會搞笑。」
