      <p><b>Topline:</b> Drake’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/canopy-adds-drake-to-its-growing-roster-of-cannabis-partnerships?srnd=markets-vp">More Life Growth Company</a> joins the ranks of celebrity-driven cannabis partnerships with Canopy Growth, which has been in a protracted slump.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drake, whose <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2019/06/14/drake-net-worth-150-million-in-2019/#3ecd69a11774">net worth</a> <i>Forbes</i> estimated to be $150 million in 2019, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/canopy-adds-drake-to-its-growing-roster-of-cannabis-partnerships?srnd=markets-vp">teamed up</a> with Canopy Growth, the world’s biggest cannabis company by market value.</li>
        <li>The company is 60% owned by Drake, with Canopy holding the remaining 40%.</li>
        <li>According to More Life’s <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark?id=1991352&amp;lang=eng&amp;tab=reg&amp;posNum=1&amp;search=%7B%22selectField1%22%3A%22appnum%22%2C%22textField1%22%3A%221991352%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22%22%2C%22status%22%3A%22%22%2C%22viennaField%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22searchDates%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22selectMaxDoc%22%3A%22500%22%2C%22language%22%3A%22eng%22%7D&amp;length=25&amp;start=0">trademark filing</a>, the company wants to sell weed along with a host of medicinal herb products and potentially a full range of clothing.</li>
        <li>Drake teased the announcement on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gK3hGFNaV/?igshid=1vs2ezsiw3g6g">Instagram</a>, posting a video with the caption simply reading “@morelife.” </li>
        <li>But Canopy has <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/canopy-growth-beverages-chocolates-thc-marijuana-drinks-cannabis-51572461870">stumbled through 2019</a>, having fired its founder in addition to suffering a 60% drop in its share value and having half a billion dollars in negative cash flow by August. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-07/canopy-adds-drake-to-its-growing-roster-of-cannabis-partnerships?srnd=markets-vp">Bloomberg reported</a> that celebrity partnerships can drive brand recognition, but may not do much to bump up value for shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“The idea of being able to build something special in an industry that is ever growing has been inspiring. More Life and More Blessing,” said Drake in a <a href="https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canadian-icons-come-together-canopy-growth-and-drake-launch-new-cannabis-wellness-company/?sf112071810=1">press release</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> The who’s who of celebrities working with Canopy include Snoop Dogg and his best friend Martha Stewart, along with actor Seth Rogan. Rapper Jay-Z, actress Whoopi Goldberg and singer Melissa Etheridge also have cannabis ventures with other companies. Despite its famous partners, Canopy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marijuana-madness-turns-into-a-cannabis-crash-11570888800">reported</a> a C$1.3 billion loss in the quarter ending June 30. Both U.S.- and Canada-based marijuana companies are struggling in 2019, with share prices tumbling and mergers scrapped.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> More Life will be based in Toronto, Drake’s hometown.</p>
