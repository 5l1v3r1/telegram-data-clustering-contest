      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A former Albuquerque police officer accused of pushing a handcuffed suspect’s head into the wall of a cell has pleaded no contest to a battery charge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hill/">John Hill</a> entered the plea Thursday in connection with a Feb. 17 incident involving a man accused of causing a disturbance at a church.</p>
      <p>The incident prompted a Police Department investigation that led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hill/">Hill</a> being fired.</p>
      <p>The Albuquerque Journal reports that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-hill/">Hill</a> will be placed on unsupervised probation for six months and be eligible to eventually have the conviction dismissed.</p>
