《書上設計展2019》：不是本科又怎樣，想要就衝了啊！
07 Nov 2019 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是每個人面對自己的現在或未來，難免困惑，甚至處在其中，心中卻是對他方的想像。如果有夢，是什麼讓你停在此地呢？我們很容易把自己綁在一個自己限定的框架裡面，最後變成不知道是自己辦不到，還是潛意識中自己不允許自己達成了。



「轉彎人生」收錄了以設計為始或終的幾個分享，他們也曾經日夜為設計燃燒生命，但發現了其他更熱愛的東西，而帶著與其他本業中不同的設計養分，在新的行業中繪出不同的色彩；更有出生並非設計相關，但就是一股想要的熱情，帶自己在設計相關領域裡，活出自己跟別人不同的力度。
其實並不限定是設計，用心走過的路都沒有浪費；任何想要抵達的地方，就算你現在還很遙遠，但只要你想，就不要被害怕裹了足，因為跨出去後的一片天，絕對不是站在原地看得見的。你的起始點也許現在看來不是你的目的地，但也因為這個點，畫出你獨一無二的亮點。
〈前高雄文化局長－尹立〉從設計師變成文化局長的狠角色
初次見到前高雄市文化局長尹立時，是在2017年高雄設計節的開幕派對餐桌上。當時高雄設計節首次規劃「為市政設計」內容，找來工務局、社會局、捷運局進入展覽內容，讓人驚艷文化局背後運籌帷幄的能力，在設計界產生很大的話題討論。要與背後的關鍵人物談話，心情戰戰兢兢，但卻在一個「你對外界總說高雄是文化沙漠的評語，有何看法？」問題上，看見尹立這個官員，另外潛藏的學者人格與設計師特質……
〈金雞母主廚－黃泰彥〉設計一碗法式基底台日混血的挫冰
金雞母主廚為台北科技大學工業設計畢業的黃泰彥，他畢業後也曾循所謂設計科系畢業的正常人生流程，成為設計師；但每天都在電腦上繪製汽車 3D 模型，睜大眼睛、擴張血絲去調整設計中的小細節，黃泰彥很快就對自己的人生開始產生質疑，不曉得每天調這些小數點以下兩位的板材厚度，對自己有什麼意義？
〈前美可特設計－顧介鈞〉鐵人三項般的設計轉職人生
人生中所經歷的人事物都會在你需要的時候跳出來幫助你。當你發現工作狀態不甚理想、無法得到相對應的回報時，建議你暫停一下快轉的人生，留給自己空間思考。工作的選擇不需要被過往侷限，機會來臨的時候要勇敢去嘗試，試了之後才會知道自己能不能做、適不適合。顧介鈞積極樂觀的個人特質，讓他在不同跑道上都能保持赤子般的好奇心探索挑戰，對人生的迷惘反而成為他向前跨出一步的能量，雖說轉換到一個新領域需要很大的勇氣，也要付出相當的努力，但也只有當你勇敢地跨出去，才會看見不同人生壯闊的風景。
〈麻醉風暴2攝影－安宜倫〉心理的溫度拍出不妥協的影像人生
如果能重新選擇，是否還是會毅然決然地走進影像創作的路？面對這個不可逆的假想題，安宜倫說，人生最重要的事情，「就是相信自己當下的決定。」
2018 年，以〈麻醉風暴2〉入圍金鐘獎攝影獎，可說是讓從心理專業半路轉行的安宜倫更堅定了當初的決心。畢業於中原心理系的他其實也能追隨其他同學一般的人生道路，好好地在心理相關領域安安穩穩地領一份外界看起來其實不錯的薪水，但他卻因為老家一台母親留下來的AE-1 老底片機玩出興趣，而決定要跳進平面攝影界，後來更隻身前往澳洲，攻讀電影學校的攝影專業。

07 Nov 2019 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that everyone faces their own present or future, and it is inevitable that they are confused and even in it. The mind is the imagination of others.
