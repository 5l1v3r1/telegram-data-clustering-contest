      <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A former Philadelphia Navy Yard worker charged with lying to the FBI about his ties to white nationalist groups to obtain security clearance at the historic shipyard was denied bail Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Fred Arena, 41, stands accused of lying on an application for a national security clearance in January for his job as a government contractor at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility.</p>
      <p>The Salem, New Jersey, resident is an avowed member of Vanguard America, a white supremacist group, and authorities said he did not disclose on the federal form that he had ever been a member of the organization.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Pennsylvania arrested and charged Arena with making false statements to government agents in October.</p>
      <p>Arena has denied the allegations.</p>

      <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge David Strawbridge withheld bail because he agreed with prosecutors’ depiction of Arena, who say he’s a danger to the community and potential witnesses in his case, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.</p>
      <p>Arena’s Facebook pages are filled with photos of him holding guns and knives with captions that threaten violence to places of worship, the Inquirer reported.</p>
      <p>Strawbridge’s decision came after several hearings over the last week in which his attorney, Brian Zeiger, accused prosecutors of attempting to jail Arena solely because of his beliefs.</p>
      <p>Zeiger pushed back on the assertion that Arena’s social media posts were proof of him being an imminent threat.</p>

        <p>“Every single thing in those photos is legal under the First and Second Amendments,” Zeiger said during proceedings Thursday. “It’s not illegal to be a member of one of those groups.”</p>
        <p>A trial date has not been set in his case.</p>
