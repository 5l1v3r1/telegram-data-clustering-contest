      <p>BERLIN (AP) - Olivier Ntcham scored deep in injury time for Celtic to book its place in the knockout stages of the Europa League with a 2-1 come-from-behind win at Lazio on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The French midfielder, who previously played for Lazio’s Italian rival Genoa, lifted the ball over goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha after Odsonne Edouard capitalized on a mistake from Valon Berisha to set him up in the 95th minute.</p>
      <p>The goal set off wild celebrations among an estimated 9,000 Celtic fans attending the game at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>Police said two traveling fans had been stabbed by Lazio supporters before the game, following a brawl outside a pub, and that five Lazio fans were stopped for possession of dangerous materials such as baseball bats and knives.</p>
      <p>With just three points from its opening three games, Lazio needed a win to have any realistic hopes of progressing. The home side took a seventh-minute lead through Ciro Immobile before pushing for more.</p>

      <p>But James Forrest equalized with Celtic’s first attempt in the 38th and Ntcham’s late lob all but ended Lazio’s prospects of advancing from Group E.</p>
      <p>With two games remaining, Celtic leads with 10 points, one ahead of Romanian side Cluj, which beat Rennes 1-0, and seven ahead of Lazio. Rennes has one point.</p>
      <p>Former champion Sevilla also booked its place in the knockout stages, with a 5-2 win at Luxembourg champion Dudelange.</p>
      <p>The Spanish side raced into a four-goal lead in the first 36 minutes, with Munir completing his hat trick in the second half.</p>

        <p>APOEL Nicosia defeated Qarabag 2-1 in the other Group A game. Sevilla is through with 12 points, followed by APOEL and Qarabag on four with Dudelange propped the group on three points.</p>
        <p>Maxime Lestienne scored in injury time for Belgian side Standard Lüttich to beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1.</p>
        <p>There were wins too for Basel, Krasnodar, Sporting Lisbon and Austrian side LASK Linz.</p>
        <p>Manchester United, Roma and Porto were in action later Thursday.</p>
