      <h1>China Bans Minors From Playing Video Games After 10 PM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>China has a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50315960">new plan</a> for preventing youth video game addiction: make it literally illegal for minors to do too much gaming.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, China’s National Press and Publication Administration <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-11/06/content_5449157.htm">released new regulations</a> banning people under the age of 18 from playing videos games between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. Even outside of those hours, minors are no longer allowed to game for more than 90 minutes on weekdays and three hours on weekends and holidays.</p>
      <p>Additionally, China is prohibiting gamers between the ages of eight and 15 from spending more than 200 yuan ($29) on video games per month, while 16- and 17-year-olds can spend up to 400 yuan ($57).</p>
      <p>To keep track of this weirdly rigid tier system, China is setting up a system through which gaming minors must register their real names. Gaming companies will then verify players’ identities via a national database.</p>
      <p>To be fair, in 2018 the World Health Organization did officially recognize <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/neurotic-introverted-men-risk-gaming-addiction">gaming addiction</a> as a <a href="https://www.who.int/features/qa/gaming-disorder/en/">mental health disorder</a>. In a <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2019-11/05/c_1125194322.htm">statement</a> published by state-run news agency <i>Xinhua</i>, the National Press and Publication Administration said that it hopes the new regulations will prevent youth<b>s</b> from experiencing the mental and physical health problems that can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/magazine/can-you-really-be-addicted-to-video-games.html">happen when</a> you get hooked on gaming.</p>
      <p>Still, young people in China who want to play video games might just resort to using their parents’ IDs and phone numbers to get around the rules.</p>
      <p>“There are always going to be loopholes,” Daniel Ahmad, a senior analyst at Niko Partners, a research and consulting firm focused on Asia’s gaming market, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-video-game-ban-young.html">told <i>The New York Times</i></a>.</p>
