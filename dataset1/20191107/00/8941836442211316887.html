      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky nurse has been charged with sexually abusing a patient who reported that he touched her bare breasts with ungloved hands and rubbed her inner thighs.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 48-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-dorsey/">Scott Dorsey</a> is set to be arraigned on Nov. 15. Court records allege he went into a patient’s room at Louisville’s Jewish Hospital in November 2018 and inappropriately touched her while repeatedly saying “I would like to video you.”</p>
      <p>The documents say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-dorsey/">Dorsey</a> was unknown to the woman, who initially assumed he had medical reasons for his actions but later reported the encounter. He was later fired.</p>
