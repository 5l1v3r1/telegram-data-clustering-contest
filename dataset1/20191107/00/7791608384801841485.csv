07 Nov 2019 by Mikelle Leow
Will Aldi’s holiday commercial be the greatest show among them all this year? The supermarket has just unveiled its Christmas ad for UK viewers, and it’s jam-packed with action and pop culture influences comprising references to the BBC’s Peaky Blinders, The Greatest Showman, and A Christmas Carol. Set to Robbie Williams’ Let Me Entertain You, the short starts with Aldi’s protagonist Kevin the Carrot in trouble. He’s being held hostage and bound to a grater by a cap-wearing gang of Brussels sprouts called the Leafy Blinders. “Because Christmas before Kevin was all about sprouts,” the narrator explains. Advertisement Advertisement The root vegetable is unexpectedly rescued by a baby tomato, and as the show must go on, Kevin begins performing on a dinner table mirroring The Greatest Showman. Enjoy the delightful video, produced by advertising agency McCann Manchester, below.
