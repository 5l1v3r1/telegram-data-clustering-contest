      <p><i>(Updated: 3:23 p.m. EST, 11/7/2019)</i><b>Topline: </b>Juul <a href="https://newsroom.juul.com/juul-labs-stops-the-sale-of-mint-juulpods-in-the-united-states/">stopped sales</a> of its mint nicotine pods Thursday after a National Youth Tobacco survey showed the number of high school students vaping has grown to one in four, while a separate study indicated mint was the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teens-increasingly-prefer-mint-flavored-juul-so-how-effective-is-a-ban-on-fruit-flavors-2019-11-06">number one flavor</a> for that age group.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“These results are unacceptable and that is why we must reset the vapor category in the U.S. and earn the trust of society,” said chief executive K.C. Crosthwaite in a press release. </li>
        <li>The mint pods make up 70% of Juul’s U.S. sales, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/juul-halts-sales-of-its-popular-mint-flavor.html">CNBC</a>, and while they’ll be withdrawn, Juul’s classic tobacco, Virginia tobacco and menthol pods will remain on the market.</li>
        <li>Other studies published Tuesday in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> found mint was the most popular flavor among high school students.</li>
        <li>Pulling the mint pods from store shelves followed a week after a former Juul SVP filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the company, with the additional claim that it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/10/30/ousted-juul-executive-claims-vaping-firm-refused-to-recall-1-million-contaminated-pods/#5a02aea95d7e">refused to recall</a> one million contaminated pods. </li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ktXuQSp8GrNgSOCftBjqJiL8XbKD1rL4/view?usp=sharing">The lawsuit</a> also alleges that after Juul stopped selling its fruit and candy-flavored pods, it “did nothing more than to increase the demand for mint-flavored pods.” </li>
        <li>The Trump administration is separately expected to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/kellyanne-conway-says-trump-administration-will-announce-flavored-e-cigarette-policy-very-soon.html">announce a policy</a> on e-cigarettes exempting menthol and tobacco flavors from any ban, but it’s unclear when that will take place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big number: </b>Altria said Thursday it’s taking a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/investing/altria-juul-writedown/index.html">$4.5 billion write down</a> on its investment in Juul. It invested $12.8 billion in Juul for a 35% stake in 2018.</p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Juul has been caught in the middle of public health scares over vaping. Over 2,000 people have been sickened with vaping-related illness, while nearly 40 people have died from it, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control.  A number of the cases have been linked with vaping THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis. Several states, including New York, Michigan, Oregon and Massachusetts have banned e-cigarettes flavors, including those popularized by Juul, to tackle surging use by teenagers and nicotine addiction.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> Juul said October 28 it would <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/28/juul-says-it-will-lay-off-employees-amid-vaping-scrutiny/#585f511c79a1">cut 500 jobs</a> by the end of the year, considered by executives as a “necessary reset” following the onslaught of regulatory and legal challenges it faces.</p>
