芬蘭小島現驚人奇景 數千萬「冰蛋」佔領海灘

07 Nov 2019, 00:55

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】隨着冬季的到來，芬蘭北部的氣溫逐漸下降。近日在芬蘭的海盧奧托島（Hailuoto）海灘出現了十分壯觀的「冰蛋」奇景——成千上萬顆、大大小小的冰蛋密密麻麻地佈滿了整個海灘，而且綿延好幾公里，這樣的奇特景象讓當地民眾興奮不已。
綜合俄羅斯衛星通訊社、CNN等媒體報導，位於波羅的海最北端的海盧奧托島海灘上，近日憑空出現了無數大大小小的「冰蛋」。一顆顆半透明乳白色的橢圓冰球整整齊齊地排佈在海灘上，規模宏大，範圍達數平方英里。
當地居民告訴媒體，雖然以前也曾看到過冰球，但如此龐大規模的冰球佈滿整片沙灘的奇景是前所未見的。居民們對這些「冰蛋」 形成的原因都感到大為困惑，有人開玩笑稱「這些蛋可沒有母雞來孵化」。



芬蘭氣象研究所的冰川專家約尼•瓦尼奧（Jouni Vainio）在接受媒體採訪時解釋說，儘管這種大規模的「冰蛋」確實很罕見，但這些冰球並不是生物行為造成的，也不是人為製造的，而是一種非常特殊的自然現象。
瓦尼奧表示，「冰蛋」的出現，需要一種罕見的接近冰點的空氣和水的條件組合，冰在這種條件下緩慢地聚集在諸如碎冰、小石頭甚至是一小塊漂流物的周圍，然後在恰到好處的風力條件下，在潮汐等自然現象的作用下，這些大大小小的冰凝結物體就有機會被海浪打磨成光滑的球體。
瓦尼奧說：「海岸線附近的流水在特定條件下會以層層疊的方式相互結冰、推擠，並在沖上岸時發生旋轉而打磨成光滑球體」。
據了解，除芬蘭以外，俄羅斯西伯利亞沿海以及美國密西根湖沿岸也曾出現過類似冰蛋景象。

Finnish islands are amazingly amazing. Tens of millions of ""ice eggs"" occupy the beach.

07 Nov 2019, 00:55

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] With the arrival of winter, the temperature in northern Finland has gradually declined. Recently, a spectacular ""ice egg"" scene has appeared on the beach of Hailuoto in Finland - thousands of large and small ice eggs are densely covered with the entire beach and stretch for several kilometers. Such a strange sight has excited local people.
According to media reports from the Russian Satellite News Agency and CNN, on the beach of Hailuoto Island, the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea, numerous ""ice eggs"" have appeared in the air. The semi-transparent milky white oval ice hockeys are neatly arranged on the beach and are large in scale, ranging from a few square miles.
Local residents told the media that although ice hockey had been seen before, the wonders of such a large-scale ice hockey covered the entire beach were unprecedented. Residents were greatly confused about the reasons for the formation of these ""ice eggs"". Some people joked that ""these eggs can be hatched without hens.""



Jouni Vainio, a glacier expert at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, explained in an interview with the media that although such large-scale ""ice eggs"" are indeed rare, they are not caused by biological behavior. It is not artificially created, but a very special natural phenomenon.
Vagno said that the emergence of ""ice eggs"" requires a rare combination of air and water conditions close to the freezing point, under which ice slowly accumulates in such things as crushed ice, small stones or even a small drift. Around, and then under just the right wind conditions, under the influence of natural phenomena such as tides, these large and small ice condensation objects have the opportunity to be polished by the waves into smooth spheres.
Vagno said: ""The flow of water near the coastline will freeze and push each other under certain conditions, and will rotate into a smooth sphere when it is washed ashore.""
It is understood that in addition to Finland, there are similar ice eggs in the coast of Siberia, Russia, and along the shores of Lake Michigan in the United States.
