Bye Bye Marciano Museum
07 Nov 2019 by Tom Teicholz
Los Angeles’ Marciano Foundation Art Museum, the 3 year old art museum founded by Marciano brothers, Paul and Maurice,who made their fortune in the jeans business has unceremoniously closed.

Housed in a former Masonic Temple on Wilshire Boulevard in Hancock Park, the museum’s collection was not particularly focused and was very much an art-advised wealthy person’s hit list of contemporary artists. Nonethelss, the Museum in its brief existence, had many strong temporary or traveling exhibits by such artists as Ai Wei Wei, Yayoi Kusuma, Catherine Opie, and Olafur Eliasson.
Much as no one really knew why the Museum opened (Altruism? Philanthropy? Tax benefits?), the reasons for it closing are not known. Some have suggested that employees attempting to unionize recently was reason to close, but no one really knows at this time.
I can’t say it will be missed. And I can’t say it added to Los Angeles many museums by being distinctive. I do hope the collection, and sponsoring of exhibition by the Marcianos and their foundation continues, perhaps to bolster MOCA or add to the increasing influence of the Hammer.
