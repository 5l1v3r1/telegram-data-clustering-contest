      <h1>Madeleine McCann family's friend slams ex-detective over 'spiteful' search remark</h1>
      <h2>Former officer John Coxon took aim at Scotland Yard's efforts to find missing Maddie - but his comments have been branded "ludicrous"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:49:06+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 00:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jerry Lawton</a></address>
      <p>A family friend of the McCanns has slammed an ex-detective over his 'spiteful' remark about the search for missing Madeleine.</p>
      <p>Retired vice squad officer John Coxon demanded an end to efforts to find the missing girl.</p>
      <p>And he said Scotland Yard’s £12million probe Operation Grange is a “disgraceful waste of resources,” reports the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/madeleine-mccann-family-pals-slam-20828259">Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>A source close to the couple has slammed Mr Coxon and fumed: “The opinion of a retired officer who has not even worked on the case is quite frankly ludicrous.</p>
      <p>“It is insensitive and spiteful towards Madeleine’s family and the detectives who are trying their utmost to find out what happened.”</p>

      <p>Madeleine vanished from her family’s Portuguese holiday apartment in 2007 when she was just three years old.</p>
      <p>Mr Coxon has called on the Independent Office Of Police Conduct to shut down the inquiry, branding it “the biggest scandal in the history of the Met”.</p>
      <p>But the body has confirmed it will not investigate his gripe. They say his complaint is invalid in law because he has not been personally affected by the case.</p>

      <p>Mr Coxon has not responded to requests for comment on the decision not to pursue his complaint.</p>
      <p>Tonight, doctor parents Kate and Gerry, who believe their daughter was abducted and continue to hope she may still be alive, thanked police for continuing their hunt for Madeleine.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the McCanns said tonight: “Kate and Gerry have been advised not to talk about the inquiry while it is still ongoing and they remain extremely grateful to the Met Police.”</p>
