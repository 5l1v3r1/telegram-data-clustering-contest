Topline: A judge ordered President Donald Trump on Thursday to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit accusing him and his family of misusing funds from the now-shuttered Trump Foundation to further his political interests, confirming previous reporting about financial mismanagement related to Trump and his charities.

The lawsuit was brought in July 2018 by the New York state attorney general.
The settlement says that Trump admitted to illegally using funds from the Trump Foundation to coordinate with his 2016 presidential campaign, settle legal obligations of companies he controlled and to pay for a $10,000 portrait of himself.
The illegal political coordination took place in January 2016, settlement documents say, when $2.8 million in proceeds from a Trump Foundation fundraiser was distributed to veterans’ organizations by his campaign, which took credit for it, instead of the foundation.
The $2 million settlement, along with the Trump Foundation’s remaining assets—$1.78 million—will go into a fund for a group of nonprofits, including the United Negro College Fund and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
As part of the agreement, Trump admitted wrongdoing and faces restrictions on any charity he joins in the future, such as requiring that any nonprofit he joins have a majority of independent directors. The attorney general’s office had wanted a full ban on joining the board of any nonprofit.

Key background: Six months after the lawsuit was filed, the Trump Foundation shut its doors. Charities belonging to Trump and his family, including Trump’s children Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, have also been scrutinized for self-dealing and financial impropriety. Forbes reported in 2017 that the Trump Foundation apparently used a separate charity started by Eric Trump to funnel $100,000 in donations into revenue for the Trump Organization, the family’s real estate business.
Tangent: Here is how Forbes calculated Trump’s net worth, which sits at $3.1 billion.
