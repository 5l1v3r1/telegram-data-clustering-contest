      <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - The Memphis Grizzlies finally held onto a fourth-quarter lead thanks to the play of their starting guards.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dillon-brooks/">Dillon Brooks</a> scored 31 points, rookie <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja-morant/">Ja Morant</a> added 26 and the Grizzlies beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> 137-121 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The fourth-quarter play of the two guards sealed the game with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dillon-brooks/">Brooks</a> scoring 16 points in the period and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja-morant/">Morant</a> adding 14, The pair combined to shoot 11 of 17 in the quarter.</p>
      <p>“It was a good way to end the game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dillon-brooks/">Brooks</a> said. “We put it in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja-morant/">Ja</a>’s hands and he knew how to finish the game.”</p>
      <p>But it was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dillon-brooks/">Brooks</a> who put the game away, scoring all 10 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> points in a 10-2 burst near the midway point of the fourth.</p>

      <p>Rookie Brandon Clarke made all seven of his shots and scored 18 points, while Jae Crowder also had 18 points for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a>. The Grizzlies snapped a three-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>The game featured two of the league’s fastest teams in pace, leading to rapid changing ends of the court. The Grizzlies were able to record 26 fast-break points compared to 13 for Minnesota. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> would end the night shooting a season-best 57%, including connecting on 12 of 23 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>The 137 points was the second-highest scoring game in franchise history - quite the change from the grit and grind era where <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> was annually among the slowest-pace teams in the league.</p>
      <p>“It was mostly the transition defense, but our halfcourt defense wasn’t that good either,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a> coach Ryan Saunders said.</p>

        <p>Andrew Wiggins led the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a> with 30 points. Karl-Anthony Towns returned from a two-game suspension for a confrontation with Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid to finish with 25 points and 13 rebounds.</p>
        <p>“It came down to getting stops,” Wiggins said. “We couldn’t get any stops. They had some guys who kept making plays.”</p>
        <p>For <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> coach Taylor Jenkins, the victory - the Grizzlies’ second of a season - is an example of the continued work needed for his young team to improve. And he is noticing strides in the right direction.</p>
        <p>“You’ve got to be able to do this night-in and night-out,” Jenkins said. “Minnesota still scored a bunch of points. We can get better defensively. We can get better offensively. But where we’re trending, this was a big step for us.”</p>

        <p>PAINT PRODUCTION</p>

        <p>For the second straight game, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja-morant/">Morant</a> went flying toward the basket only to end up on the floor in a heap after missing the shot. Each time, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> fans have held their breath. “I tell him to chill out,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dillon-brooks/">Brooks</a> said. “You’re going to get your posters. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
