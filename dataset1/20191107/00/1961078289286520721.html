      <h1>Don’t Let Trump Make You Numb to What’s Unacceptable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:00:53+00:00">07 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Kristof</a></address>
      <p>The problem with being a frog in a beaker is that you may not notice the water temperature rising to a boil.</p>
      <p>Humans, too. In New Delhi, people get used to air that is filthy. In Syria, to checkpoints. In Angola, to corruption. In China, to propaganda. And in America, we risk becoming numbed to a political, social and moral breakdown.</p>
      <p>Scandal and dysfunction dribble out from Washington day by day, numbing us so that we may forget just how unprecedented and outrageous the trends are. It was only five years ago that Fox News was deploring a <a href="https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/902358401321115648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbarack-obama-tan-suit-anniversary">“shocking”</a> and “desperate” presidential scandal that Republican Representative Peter King <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/459155-barack-obamas-tan-suit-controversy-hits-5-year-anniversary">described</a> as inexcusable: Barack Obama wore a tan suit! Now we can’t even keep track of how many countries President Trump has asked to do him political favors.</p>
      <p>I’ve been traveling abroad, so I’ve been asking journalists and officials how they see America, and from a distance they offer blunt assessments. “If your president isn’t a Manchurian candidate,” one senior European official said, “he’s doing a pretty good imitation of one.”</p>
      <p>That distance can be useful to see the big picture. To resist complacency, let’s take stock:</p>
      <p>In 2016, Obama’s passivity and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/denis-mcdonough-mcconnell-watered-down-russia-warning-2016-n853016">Republican intransigence</a> may have allowed Russian cyberattacks to swing the presidency to Trump (there’s no way to be sure, but that’s what the forensic work of Kathleen Hall Jamieson <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump">suggests</a>). Yet despite improvement, the United States still doesn’t have an adequate strategy to foil Russian or Chinese interference in the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>Trump is a hero of many evangelical Christians who previously emphasized the importance of personal values and restoring <a href="https://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=37755">“honor and dignity”</a> to the White House. Meanwhile, he is on his third wife, has cheated on all three and has been accused of sexual misconduct by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12">25 women</a>. And Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164138795475881986">tweeted</a> a supporter’s praise likening him to “the second coming of God.”</p>
      <p>Since taking office, Trump has made more than 13,400 false or misleading statements, according to a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/">database</a>. The Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/">found </a>that he has recently accelerated his falsehoods to a rate of 22 per day, more than one per waking hour. (I’ve covered many world leaders, and the only two whom I consider pathological liars are Trump and former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.)</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/politics/donald-trump-chosen-one/index.html">declared</a> “I am the chosen one.” His press secretary last month <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/politics/john-kelly-trump-yes-man/index.html">spoke of</a> “the genius of our great President.”</p>
      <p>Trump, who according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?module=inline">a Times investigation</a> is wealthy partly because of fraud, pledged to fight corruption and “drain the swamp.” Since then, he has <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-cabinet-ethics-cloud_n_5d28d5f9e4b02a5a5d5a793f?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067">lost more first-term cabinet members</a> to scandal than any president in history.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=f0NZt_-eB9o">Trump said </a>before his election. In fact, he has visited golf clubs approximately <a href="https://trumpgolfcount.com/">224 times</a> since taking office, including more than three months in total at Mar-a-Lago. These vacation trips have cost taxpayers more than $100 million.</p>
      <p>Trump’s mother was an immigrant, as are two of the women he married (his current wife <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/was-melania-trump-once-undocumented-994609">may have been</a> undocumented). Yet he has ripped children from parents at the border, and his administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/migrant-children-toothbrushes-court.html?module=inline">argued </a>that detained immigrant children do not need soap or toothbrushes.</p>
      <p>We haven’t even gotten to Trump trying to buy Greenland, marching into women’s changing rooms to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing">admire </a><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing">undressed</a><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/teen-beauty-queens-say-trump-walked-in-on-them-changing"> teenagers</a>, borrowing Stalinist language to denounce the press as the “enemy of the people,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en">claiming</a> that climate change is a Chinese conspiracy, banning Muslims or diverting money to build the wall that Mexico supposedly would pay for.</p>
      <p>Oh, and that multibillion-dollar wall is now being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-sections-of-trumps-border-wall/2019/11/01/25bf8ce0-fa72-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html?wpisrc=al_trending_now__alert-national--alert-world--alert-politics&amp;wpmk=1">cut open</a> by smugglers with $100 saws.</p>
      <p>Yet America’s dysfunction goes beyond Trump, and it will outlast Trump, even as it is aggravated by him.</p>
      <p>American kids ages 1 through 19 are <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0767">57 percent more likely to die </a>than those in other advanced nations, according to a study in the journal Health Affairs. That’s partly because the United States is virtually alone in failing to provide universal health coverage: Trump didn’t create that problem, but he did magnify it so that the number of uninsured children is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/upshot/medicaid-uninsured-children.html?module=inline">now increasing</a>.</p>
      <p>Longstanding economic inequality in the United States, exacerbated by Trump’s tax cuts and other policies, is staggering. A single hedge fund tycoon, James Simons, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-15/the-10-best-paid-hedge-fund-managers-made-7-7-billion-in-2018">made </a>$1.6 billion last year, or more than $4 million each day — yet the United States has 100,000 children who on any given night are homeless. Since 2000, <a href="https://www.fox25boston.com/news/missing-and-forgotten-thousands-of-foster-kids-kicked-out-of-the-system/755376482">61,000 foster kids</a> have simply gone missing. Girls and boys are sold by pimps for sex in every American city.</p>
      <p>America is not, as President Trump once <a href="https://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/21/donald-trump-this-country-is-a-hellhole/">called it</a>, a “hellhole.” It is a nation of enormous strengths and resources, but we need to muster them now. A merit of our species is that we are adaptable and resilient and can get used to almost anything.</p>
      <p>But we should never get accustomed to all this. Let’s not let ourselves be numbed by the daily drip into accepting a level of Trumpian dysfunction that should always be unacceptable.</p>
