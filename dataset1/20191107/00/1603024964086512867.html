      <h1>63 Moons dues: HC restrains DHFL promoters from going abroad</h1>
      <h2>The order came on a petition filed by 63 Moons Technologies seeking recovery of dues of around Rs 200 crore from DHFL.</h2>

      <p>The Bombay High Court on November restrained <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-housing/dewanhousingfinancecorporation/DHF">Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd</a> (DHFL) promoters Dheeraj Wadhawan and Kapil Wadhawan from leaving the country.</p>
      <p>The order came on a petition filed by 63 Moons Technologies seeking recovery of dues of around Rs 200 crore from DHFL.</p>
      <p>Justice S J Kathawalla said the Wadhawans will have to seek permission from the high court if they wish to leave the country.</p>

      <p>After the court passed the order, the DHFL counsel submitted a statement in the afternoon session that the Wadhawans will not leave the country before November 14.</p>
      <p>The court was hearing a plea filed by Jignesh Shah-promoted 63 Moons Technologies for recovery of around Rs 200 crore which it said were due from mortgage lender DHFL, and seeking a direction that the Wadhawans should not leave the country.</p>
      <p>DHFL had earlier told the court that the Wadhawans may have to travel abroad to raise funds.</p>
      <p>63 Moons raised apprehension that they may escape if allowed to leave the country.</p>
      <p>63 Moons, which had subscribed to non-convertible debentures (NCD) of DHFL, approached the court after the latter failed to repay the money.</p>
      <p>DHFL has challenged maintainability of the petition, arguing that trustees of bond-holders have already filed an application before the Pune bench of Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for recovery of dues on behalf of debenture-holders, so this petition is redundant.</p>
      <p>The Enforcement Directorate is conducting a probe against DHFL over alleged financial irregularities.</p>
      <p>The court posted the plea for further hearing on November 14.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
