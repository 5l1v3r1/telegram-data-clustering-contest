      <p>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) - The state of Montana has agreed to pay some of an inmate’s attorney fees and have a prison warden undergo religion rights training to settle a discrimination complaint.</p>
      <p>The Billings Gazette reported Wednesday that the state Department of Corrections settled with Montana Women’s Prison inmate May Simmons in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/simmons/">Simmons</a> said the prison failed to grant her full access to worship services as a Jehovah’s Witness.</p>
      <p>The state Human Rights Bureau says the department likely violated the law by denying Simmons use of the prison chapel while permitting its use for other religions.</p>
      <p>An agreement copy released this week says the state would pay $4,400 in fees to attorney Eric Holm and $1,000 to Simmons.</p>

      <p>It also requires the prison to provide training and an internal analysis by February.</p>
