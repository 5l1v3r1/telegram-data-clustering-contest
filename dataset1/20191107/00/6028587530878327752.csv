Gert Boyle, Longtime Columbia Sportswear Chairman, Dies At 95

Topline: Gert Boyle, the longtime chairman of Columbia Sportswear, died Sunday in Portland, Oregon, the company said. The refugee from Nazi Germany, who starred in Columbia’s iconic “One Tough Mother” ad campaign, was 95. 

Boyle’s family came to the U.S. in 1937 as refugees from Nazi Germany. When they arrived, all they had was $20. 
Boyle had served as Columbia’s chairman since 1970 (she rejected the term chairwoman, according to the Wall Street Journal), when she took over her husband’s small ski-wear company after he died suddenly of a heart attack.
She is best known for being the face of Columbia during the 1980s in the company’s humorous “One Tough Mother” ad campaign, which featured a gray-haired Boyle in Columbia outerwear with a faux tattoo reading “Born to Nag.”
Her toughness wasn’t just for show. In 2017, then 86-year-old Boyle foiled a kidnapping and burglary attempt by surreptitiously pressing the silent panic button on her home alarm system. 
Boyle’s son, Tim, helped run the business after his father died. He now serves as CEO and will assume the role of acting chairman of the board until the company appoints another chairman. 

Key background: When Boyle’s husband, Neal, took over Columbia in Portland from his father in 1964, he took out a loan with the Small Business Administration using their house, vacation home, Boyle’s mother’s house and life insurance as collateral. After he died, the only option for Boyle was to take over the businesses with her son, Tim, who still had a year left at the University of Oregon. 
Within the first two years, they almost ran the business into the ground, with sales decreasing 25% to $600,000 during the first year. A buyer offered just $1,400 for the business at the time, and in turning it down, Boyle her son recommitted to building the business. 
Since then, Columbia has grown to a recognizable sportswear brand with a $6.25 billion market cap. It went public in 1998 and now has 7,800 employees worldwide.
