      <p>HELENA, Mont. (AP) - The Great Divide Ski Area will be the first ski area in Montana to open for the new season this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Aided by the early cold and snow this fall, the staff has been making snow for a few weeks now.</p>
      <p>Owner Kevin Taylor tells the Independent Record that the Nov. 9 opening will be its earliest ever to having a chairlift running.</p>
      <p>Taylor says the ski area opened Nov. 10 last year and on Nov. 11 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Operating on Saturday will be the Good Luck Chairlift on the lower mountain as well as the backyard towrope.</p>

      <p>Snowmaking continues on some additional runs, but because the latest cold snap was so short, Taylor is uncertain whether other runs will open this weekend or next.</p>
