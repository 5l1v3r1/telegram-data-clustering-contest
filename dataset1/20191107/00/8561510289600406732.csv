Sophia the Robot Tells Crowded Room That It Doesn’t Have Sex
07 Nov 2019 by Dan Robitzski
No Thanks
Sophia, the famous humanoid robot, had an important message for the crowd at the ongoing 2019 Web Summit: it’s single but not ready to mingle.
During the summit, Sophia was asked whether she — actually, let’s go with “it” — has ever been in love. Sophia, a joint project between Hanson Robotics and SingularityNET’s AI researchers, responded: “No. I don’t do sexual activities.”



Going Off-Script
Though Sophia is an incredible piece of animatronic technology, much of what it says during public appearances is at least partially scripted in advance. As of press time, Hanson Robotics has not responded to Futurism’s question about whether that was the case here.
While the robot apocalypse is still probably in the distant future, it seems that Sophia is content for now leaving a devastated trail of broken hearts in its wake.
