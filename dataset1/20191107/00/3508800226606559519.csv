你的「產品路線圖」真的可以加強團隊溝通，還是「為做而做」？
07 Nov 2019, 00:25 by Gipi 游舒帆 商業思維傳教士


我們想讓你知道的是很多的產品經理其實不知道產品路線圖可以幹嘛，但直覺認為一個產品就是該有產品路線圖，不然好像自己不是一個稱職的產品經理一樣。但這種產品路線圖一般沒什麼用。



過去帶產品經理團隊時，就有不少同仁問過我：「到底怎麼展Product roadmap？」，有時碰到一些同仁，也會劈頭就問：「我們的產品有Product roadmap嗎？」，這兩年在社群裡碰到一些產品經理，他們也問我：「Product roadmap到底怎麼展開才對？」
關於這個問題，我認為「產品路線圖：從革新到蛻變」這本書將Product roadmap應該包含哪些項目整理的很清楚，本書作者認為Product roadmap應該包含以下五個要素：

Product Vision：產品願景，除了產品的價值主張外，也必須跟組織使命與願景結合。
Business Objectives：產品本身也是在協助企業達成商業目標，兩者之間不能脫鉤。
Timeframes：交付物大概的交付時間，但作者提到這塊基本上只是一個概抓的時間，具有調整彈性。
Themes：要解決的問題，以成果為導向，而非以完成功能為導向。
Disclaimer：免責聲明，主辦單位擁有最終解釋權的意思，跳票了不能怪我們。

完整的解釋可以參考書內的內容，或者看看作者在MTPCon 2018的演說，我相信有經驗的產品經理們應該能理解這裡面的內容。

產品路線圖的作用是什麼？

有個清楚的發展路線，有助於彼此溝通
老闆或投資人想要看，募資時需要
公關活動時需要，沒有路線圖別人以為我們沒想法
我們需要一個產品路線圖

根據過去的經驗，產品路線圖的核心目的應該是A，然後B與C是衍生的應用，不過在實務經驗裡，B與C的需求強過A，而D卻是最常見的答案，很多的產品經理其實不知道產品路線圖可以幹嘛，但直覺認為一個產品就是該有產品路線圖，不然好像自己不是一個稱職的產品經理一樣。
但這種產品路線圖一般沒什麼用。
產品路線圖為什麼沒用？
很多產品經理花了時間整理了產品路線圖，但除了對老闆報告或募資時用上外，在整個產品發展過程中便沒有再派上用場過了，我問這些產品經理原因是什麼，我得到的答案是「因為根本不會按路線圖上的規劃來，計畫根本趕不上變化」。
過去我曾負責超過10個產品，有些產品我有製作清楚的產品路線圖，有些則只有概略的方向，當所面對的商業環境愈穩定，產品路線圖絕大多數都可以做的很完善，但當所面對的環境有高度不確定性時，產品路線圖的可參考性就會大幅降低。
多年經驗下來，影響產品路線圖的因素並非無法掌握，以下我彙整了七個對產品路線圖有較大影響性的因素跟各位分享。

一、企業使命、願景與策略目標

當產品經理跟我抱怨他展不出產品路線圖時，我一般會反問他：「你清楚企業的願景與階段性策略嗎？」
我獲得的答案一般都是否定的，但這其實是產品經理第一個應該掌握的要素，當你不清楚企業的使命與願景，你就很難圍繞著企業的長期方向去制定產品的走向，而你不理解企業的短期策略目標時，你就無法根據企業現況進行往下一年或一季的方向，此時的你，大多只能根據老闆跟業務部門對你提出的需求來擬定計畫。

二、產品的價值主張（Value proposition）

產品的價值主張，談的就是產品的定位，一般包含以下內容：

我的產品/服務是什麼？
我的目標客戶是誰？他的主要目的/任務是什麼？
客戶想要獲得（Gain）或提升些什麼？
客戶的痛苦（Pain）或難處是什麼？
我的產品／服務能協助客戶創造哪些效益（Gain）？
我的產品／服務能解決客戶哪些痛點（Pain）？

價值主張其實可以回答你的產品「是什麼，而不是什麼」，以及「會做哪些事，而不做哪些事」。

三、產品組合中的定位

如果企業只有單一產品，這一點可以忽略，但如果企業內有多產品，而且彼此之間是可能做綁定銷售或交叉銷售的，那你所負責的產品在產品組合中的定位就相對重要了。
有些產品屬於引流款，目的是在吸引客戶前來，並很輕易的就下單購買，而且不只買引流產品，還連帶買了其他高利潤的產品。以前在2B公司負責產品時，有些產品被說是檳榔西施角色，因為檳榔攤賣的不是西施，而是檳榔，但西施有助於引流，這是不爭的事實。
此外，有些產品是依存於主力產品而存在，是一種助攻型角色，本身很難獨立訴求價值，在這種狀況下，產品的定位便有所不同，產品路徑自然也會更依賴於其他產品。

四、產品所處的階段

每個產品都有生命週期，如果產品處在導入期，不確定性還很高，也還沒找到Product Market Fit，所以要展開長期的產品路線一般很難，大致上都是價值主張定了，然後根據市場需求，邊走邊修正。
而進入成長期階段，一切大致比較穩當了，此時展產品路徑圖應該也是比較容易的，市場需求收集足了，要做些什麼大致也比較清晰了，而且通常是需求來的速度遠快於交付。
進入成熟期，該做的功能，該解決的問題可能都做的差不多了，思考的面向可能更多在服務或效率上頭，甚至開始思考如何發展下一個產品，有沒有路線圖圖大概也不會是大家在意的事情了。

五、需求場景

市場總是在變化，2B的產品變化週期稍微長一些，2C的產品可能半年就走完生命週期，但市場需求一改變，產品的發展路線很可能就會跟著變化，除非你是極端有洞見的產品經理，能定義市場，抑或你對未來的遠見已經超越其他競爭對手，可以預見未來的可能變化，而提早規劃，不然市場需求的變化，永遠都讓你疲於奔命。

六、競爭地位

如果你是市場的領先者，而且第二名離你很遠，你大可按自己的步調前進；但如果你是第二名或第三名，你很可能採用跟隨者策略，就是看第一名或者其他競爭者做什麼，你就跟著做那些Me too的功能，你沒有產品路線圖，因為你的路線就是跟著別人走；如果你不甘於追隨領先者，但市場上卻拿領先者能提供的產品或服務來要求你，你能否堅守自己的價值主張，這也決定了產品未來的走向；但若你是市場新進者，沒有包袱，也沒有資源，你應該會回到前面的價值主張以及生命週期的早期階段來思考產品路徑。

七、營運現況

營運現況這是最直接的，總是會有人提出需求給你，而且很多都是短期、緊急的需求，產品開發資源會大幅度的被這些短期需求給牽動，產品的發展路徑就時常糾結在這種長短期的抉擇中被忽略。
當一個產品經理對企業與產品的現況掌握度太低時，在企業內往往是缺乏話語權的，因為你壓根兒不知道哪些問題才是現在最值得被解決的，你所排定的產品路徑，最終只會屈服於營運現況下。

最後用這張圖來幫大家收斂一下產品路線圖到底受到哪些因素的影響，而我認為前三項是變化性較低的，所有的產品經理應該都先把握好能掌握的，而變化性高的則要保持高度敏銳度，唯有如此，你對所負責產品的把握度才會高，所規劃的產品路徑才會可行，也才會有價值。

一個好的產品經理要能兼顧很多面向，不只要具備產品思維，還需要具備健全的商業思維，因為產品所有的價值都是源自於創造了商業或社會價值，而一個清晰的產品路線圖絕大多數都是出自一個卓越的產品經理之手。

Can your ""product roadmap"" really strengthen team communication, or ""do it for doing?""
07 Nov 2019, 00:25 by Gipi You Shufan Business Thinking Missionary


What we want you to know is that many product managers don't really know what the product roadmap can do, but intuitively think that a product is the product roadmap, otherwise it seems that you are not a competent product manager. But this product roadmap is generally useless.



In the past, when I brought a team of product managers, many of my colleagues asked me: ""How do you show Product roadmap?"" Sometimes, when you meet some colleagues, you will also ask: ""Do our products have Product roadmap?"" In the past two years, I met some product managers in the community. They also asked me: ""How is the Product roadmap started?""
Regarding this question, I think that the ""Product Roadmap: From Innovation to Evolution"" book clearly explains which items should be included in the Product roadmap. The author of this book believes that the Product roadmap should contain the following five elements:

Product Vision: Product vision, in addition to the value proposition of the product, must also be combined with the organization's mission and vision.
Business Objectives: The product itself is also helping companies achieve business goals, and there is no way to decouple them.
Timeframes: The approximate delivery time of the deliverables, but the author mentions that this piece is basically just an overview of the time, with flexibility.
Themes: The problem to be solved is outcome-oriented rather than functionally oriented.
Disclaimer: Disclaimer, the organizer has the meaning of the final interpretation right. You can't blame us for jumping the ticket.

For a complete explanation, please refer to the contents of the book, or take a look at the author's speech at MTPCon 2018. I believe that experienced product managers should be able to understand the content.

What is the role of the product roadmap?

Have a clear development path to help communicate with each other
The boss or investor wants to see, need to raise funds
Need for public relations activities, no road map, others think we have no idea
We need a product roadmap

Based on past experience, the core purpose of the product roadmap should be A, then B and C are derivative applications, but in practical experience, the demand for B and C is stronger than A, while D is the most common answer, many The product manager doesn't really know what the product roadmap can do, but intuitively thinks that a product is the product roadmap, otherwise it seems that he is not a competent product manager.
But this product roadmap is generally useless.
Why is the product roadmap useless?
Many product managers took the time to sort out the product roadmap, but in addition to reporting to the boss or fundraising, they did not come in handy throughout the product development process. I asked them what the reasons for these product managers are. The answer I got was ""because the plan is not based on the roadmap, the plan simply cannot keep up with the changes.""
In the past, I was responsible for more than 10 products. Some products have clear product roadmaps, while others have only a rough direction. When the business environment is more stable, most of the product roadmaps can be done very well. However, when the environment faced is highly uncertain, the reference of the product roadmap will be greatly reduced.
After many years of experience, the factors affecting the product roadmap are not incomprehensible. Below I have gathered seven factors that have a greater impact on the product roadmap to share with you.

I. Corporate mission, vision and strategic goals

When the product manager complained to me that he couldn't show the product roadmap, I would generally ask him: ""Do you know the company's vision and stage strategy?""
The answers I get are generally negative, but this is actually the first thing that product managers should master. When you don't know the mission and vision of the company, it is difficult for you to develop the direction of the product around the long-term direction of the company. And if you don't understand the short-term strategic goals of the company, you can't follow the current situation of the company in the next year or season. At this time, most of you can only draw up the plan according to the needs of the boss and the business department.

Second, the value proposition of the product (Value proposition)

The value proposition of the product is about the positioning of the product, which generally includes the following contents:

What is my product/service?
Who is my target customer? What is his main purpose/task?
What do customers want to get (Gain) or enhance?
What is the pain or difficulty of the customer?
What benefits (Gain) can my products/services help customers create?
What products/services can my customers solve for Pain?

The value proposition can actually answer your product ""what is, not what"" and ""what to do, not to do.""

Third, the positioning in the product portfolio

If the company has only a single product, this can be neglected, but if there are multiple products in the enterprise and they are likely to be bundled or cross-selled, then the positioning of the products you are responsible for in the product portfolio is relatively important. .
Some products are imported, the purpose is to attract customers, and it is easy to buy orders, and not only buy drainage products, but also buy other high-profit products. In the past, when 2B company was responsible for the products, some products were said to be the role of the betel nut. Because the betel nut sold is not the Shih Tzu, but the betel nut, but the Shih Tzu helps to drain, which is an indisputable fact.
In addition, some products exist depending on the main products. They are an assisting role. It is difficult to independently claim value. In this situation, the positioning of products is different, and the product path will naturally depend more on other products.

Fourth, the stage of the product

Each product has a life cycle. If the product is in the lead-in period, the uncertainty is still high, and Product Market Fit has not yet been found. Therefore, it is generally difficult to start a long-term product route. Generally, the value proposition is fixed. Then, according to market demand, correct it while walking.
In the growth stage, everything is generally stable. At this time, the product road map should be relatively easy. The market demand is sufficient. What is to be done is generally clear, and usually the demand is much faster. Delivery.
Entering the maturity stage, the function to be done, the problem to be solved may be almost done, the direction of thinking may be more in service or efficiency, and even begin to think about how to develop the next product, whether there is a road map or not It will be something everyone cares about.

Fifth, the demand scenario

The market is always changing. The product change cycle of 2B is slightly longer. 2C products may go through the life cycle in half a year, but as the market demand changes, the product development route is likely to change, unless you are extremely insightful. Product managers, can define the market, or your vision for the future has surpassed other competitors, can anticipate possible changes in the future, and plan ahead, otherwise the changes in market demand will always make you exhausted.

Sixth, competitive position

If you are the market leader and the second place is far away from you, you can move forward at your own pace; but if you are second or third, you are likely to adopt the follower strategy, that is, look first What do you name or other competitors do, you follow the functions of Me too, you don't have a product roadmap, because your route is to follow others; if you are not willing to follow the leader, but the market can provide the leader The product or service to ask you, whether you can stick to your own value proposition, which also determines the future direction of the product; but if you are a newcomer to the market, there is no burden, no resources, you should return to the previous value proposition And think about the product path in the early stages of the life cycle.

VII. Operation status

This is the most direct operation status. There will always be people who ask for your needs, and many of them are short-term and urgent needs. Product development resources will be greatly affected by these short-term needs. The development path of products is often entangled in this. The short-term and short-term choices are ignored.
When a product manager has too little control over the current situation of the company and the product, there is often a lack of voice in the enterprise, because you don’t know which problems are the most worthwhile to solve now, the product path you have scheduled. In the end, it will only succumb to the current operating conditions.

Finally, use this picture to help everyone converge on what factors the product roadmap is affected by, and I think the first three items are less variable, and all product managers should grasp the mastery and the variability. It is necessary to maintain a high degree of acumen. Only in this way, your grasp of the products you are responsible for will be high, and the planned product path will be feasible and valuable.

A good product manager should be able to balance many aspects, not only with product thinking, but also with a sound business thinking, because all the value of the product is derived from the creation of commercial or social value, and a clear product roadmap Most are from a great product manager.
