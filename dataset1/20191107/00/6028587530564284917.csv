Interestingly, none of Target’s Black Friday ad scan laptop and TV deals catch my attention like the current live deals. That said, there are some standout options here: the Galaxy smartphone deals are head turners and Target is going big on the Nintendo Switch when rivals are not (so far).

There’s also the best iPad deal you’re going to find this year and Target has some killer smart home deals, I don’t expect the Google Nest Hub, Home and Home Mini Gen-2 deals to be beaten.
