        <b>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min said he was "really sorry" for his tackle which led to Everton midfielder Andre Gomes' horrific ankle injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gomes had surgery on Monday after he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50283980">suffered a fractured dislocation</a> to his right ankle in Sunday's league draw.</p>
      <p>Son was sent off for his tackle on Gomes and was visibly distressed.</p>
      <p>"It has been a really tough few days," Son told BT Sport after scoring twice in Spurs' <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50296549">4-0 Champions League win</a> at Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p>"I have realised how lucky I am with all the support I have had from the fans and my team-mates," he added.</p>
      <p>"I can say I'm really sorry for the accident and the situation but I had to focus for the team and I had to keep going and it was the right response to all the people who have supported me."</p>

      <p>Son scored two goals in four minutes as second-placed Tottenham easily won their Group B game to open up a four-point gap over Red Star Belgrade in third.</p>
      <p>The South Korean did not celebrate his first goal, instead clasping his hands and bowing his head.</p>
      <p>His red card for the tackle on Gomes at Goodison Park was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50309594">overturned</a> by the Football Association on Tuesday following an appeal by Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino had described Son as "devastated" following the incident, while team-mate Dele Alli said he "couldn't pick his head up".</p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Gomes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50325253">thanked fans</a> on social media for their support.</p>
