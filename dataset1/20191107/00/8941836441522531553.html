        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The women of “The View,” namely Meghan McCain and Sunny Hostin, have had a particularly rollicking time in recent media cycles screaming — figuratively (mostly) — about the illegalities of naming names that should not be publicly named and warning of the crime, the federal crime, the jail-able federal crime of identifying, out loud, the whistleblower whom Democrats seem to believe is the golden key to impeach.</p>
      <p>But sift through the shrill; step away from expressions of hate. Law is: It’s not against the law to out this whistleblower.</p>
      <p>It’s only against the law for the inspector general to out this whistleblower.</p>
      <p>The rest of us — memo to ladies of “The View” — maintain our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech. And yes, yes indeed, that includes the president of the United States, too. Oh, and members of the media.</p>
      <p>Saying otherwise is a lie. Yet that hasn’t kept others from saying otherwise. </p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Here’s the latest: Donald Trump Jr. was a recent guest on “The View” alongside his girlfriend, the former Fox News host and attorney Kimberly Guilfoyle. During, Hostin said to Guilfoyle, “Kimberly, you’re a lawyer … did you advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out a whistleblower?”</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. jumped in and clarified, Mediaite <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/tv/sunny-hostin-to-ex-lawyer-kim-guilfoyle-did-you-inform-your-boyfriend-its-a-federal-crime-to-unmask-whistleblower/">reported</a>, “it’s only a federal crime for the IG to do it.”</p>
      <p>And Hostin responded: “That’s a lie.”</p>
      <p>Hmm. Who’s right?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Sen. Rand Paul says Trump Jr.</p>
        <p>“The whistleblower statute protects the whistleblower from having his name revealed by the inspector general. Even The New York Times admits that no one else is under any legal obligation [to protect the name],” Rand <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/11/05/sen_rand_paul_corrects_reporter_it_is_not_illegal_for_media_to_name_the_whistleblower.html">said</a>, in a recent interview. He also said at a Trump rally he may out the whistleblower himself, in the coming days.</p>
        <p>And for that, McCain went off the rails.</p>
        <p>“I hate him,” she <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheHill/posts/the-view-co-host-meghan-mccain-went-off-on-republican-sen-rand-paul-for-his-comm/10157642862204087/">said</a>, of Paul, after “The View” <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/469052-meghan-mccain-rips-rand-paul-for-trying-to-out-whistleblower-i-hate-him?fbclid=IwAR382sNm76QUQc-S8-PdtC5B2rD8F5vKUUJT9-wRH6SxWW2A4QstpKmvHsI">played</a> clips of his remarks. “He sounds so crazy. Why does he sound so crazy?”</p>
        <p>Nope; the ones sounding crazy are the ones telling all of America — from politicians to members of the media to the president to Joe Q. Citizen — that it’s a federal crime to publicly name the whistleblower.</p>
        <p>It’s not.</p>
        <p>Not even close.</p>
        <p>“Can Trump Legally Out The Whistleblower? Experts Say It Would Not Violate Any Laws,” NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/776481504/can-trump-legally-out-the-whistleblower-experts-say-it-would-not-violate-any-law">reported</a>, in a headline.</p>
        <p>NPR. The public media outlet that regularly receives drubbing for its leftist slant. Yet even NPR quoted several top legal and intelligence minds as saying — drumroll, please — just what Trump Jr. said: it’s only illegal for the inspector general to out this whistleblower.</p>
        <p>“There is no overarching protection for the identity of the whistleblower under federal law,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/776481504/can-trump-legally-out-the-whistleblower-experts-say-it-would-not-violate-any-law">said</a> Dan Meyer, a lawyer and the former executive director of the intelligence community whistleblower program, in NPR. Meaning, he should know.</p>
        <p>“Congress has never provided that protection,” Meyer went on.</p>
        <p>And here’s the clue Meyer knows what he’s talking about: Rand, just hours ago, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rand-paul-blocks-senate-push-to-protect-trump-whistleblower">blocked</a> a resolution on Capitol Hill — pushed by the Democrats, no less — that would’ve pressed Congress and the White House to protect whistleblowers.</p>
        <p>Why the need for the resolution if the protections are already in place?</p>
        <p>Confusion may abound because federal law is a bit of a “patchwork” when it comes to whistleblower protections, as NPR put it. On top of that, states <a href="https://www.whistleblowers.org/faq/">have</a> their own whistleblower laws; different agencies have their own whistleblower policies; and attorneys, of course, have their own interpretations of all these whistleblower rules and laws and policies.</p>
        <p>But fact is fact and on this, the fact is this whistleblower, the guy with the impeachment know-how for Democrats, has no legal right to remain unnamed — except by the IG. That’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/3829/actions">according</a> to the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998. That’s according to legal minds and intelligence experts. That’s according, even, to common-sense application of the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>That’s not to say the whistleblower’s attorneys won’t threaten and bluster and bluff to the contrary. But they stand on shaky ground.</p>
        <p>As far as law goes — for what law these days is worth — it’s simply not true to say the whistleblower’s name cannot be released.</p>
