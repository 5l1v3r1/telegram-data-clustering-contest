      <p>AEW Dynamite featured a final pitch for AEW Full Gear on a show where Cody vowed he would never challenge for an AEW World Championship again if he were unsuccessful in Saturday’s main event against Chris Jericho. The night built to a wild brawl featuring The Young Bucks, Kenny Omega, Jon Moxley, Cody and The Inner Circle.</p>
      <p>AEW Dynamite continued its weekly slide with a series-low viewership of 789,000, a number severely affected by Game 7 of the MLB World Series. With postseason baseball out of the picture, AEW’s viewership is fully expected to shoot back up to its watermark of around one million.</p>

        <b>AEW Dynamite Results: Wednesday, November 6, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>PAC def. Trent</b>
      </p>
      <p>PAC’s win-loss record must have automatically updated the win column after seeing this matchup on paper.</p>
      <p>Despite his tag team ceiling, Trent (Baretta) has always been an above-average singles performer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cody makes a Career Announcement</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cody’s career announcement is going to draw a whole lot of accusations for blatantly stealing from NWA Powerrr’s Tim Storm storyline.</p>
      <p>Cody said he’d never challenge for the AEW World Championship if he loses to Chris Jericho, but he didn’t say he wouldn’t accept a challenge from a future champion.</p>
      <p>This promo was filled with bars that, if I didn’t know any better, could have been easily convinced it was a shoot. Excellent.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Private Party def. The Dark Order</b>
      </p>
      <p>Private Party, rising babyfaces, are announced from “a place where you have to have a ticket” and their body weights are given in vodka measurements.</p>
      <p>I don’t know what The Dark Order are going for, but whatever it is, it would work so much better in CHIKARA.</p>
      <p>The Chris Jericho segment that aired after his was a hilarious, yet still somewhat serious, parody of Cody’d vignette from a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emi Sakura and Jamie Hayter def. Shanna and Riho</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emi Sakura tried to get a “boom boom clap” chant going, and boy did this crowd hate her for it.</p>
      <p>Jamie Hayter attacked Riho on the on the outside and boy did this crowd hate her for it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shawn Spears def. Brandon Cutler</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shawn Spears’ entrance does a great job of convincing viewers at home that he is little more than a good hand in AEW. I hope I’m wrong.</p>
      <p>If Brandon Cutler loses enough, there will one day be a lot of intrigue in an underdog win-streak storyline. But we’re probably years away from that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sammy Guevara and Chris Jericho vs. Kenny Omega and Hangman Adam Page</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is there a bigger star with more generic theme music than Kenny Omega in AEW?</p>
      <p>After Sammy Guevara used a selfie cam, AEW accomplished the impressive feat of stealing from NWA and NXT in one evening.</p>
      <p>There was a “we are a–holes” chant coming out of commercial, which leads me to believe Chris Jericho must have cut a heel promo calling them a–holes and it backfired.</p>
      <p>How hasn’t Prowrestlingtees.com made several more “Cowboy [expletive]” merch <a href="https://www.prowrestlingtees.com/wrestler-t-shirts/adam-page/adam-page-cowboy-sh-t.html">in addition to the original</a>? Are they still trying to get the clearances to use the poo emoji?</p>
      <p>The fact that Jake Hager refused to speak in the earlier vignette made him so much more terrifying as Jericho’s heavy.</p>
