      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Attorneys for President Donald Trump have notified the court overseeing a settlement between Ohio's capital city and porn actress Stormy Daniels of money owed to him by Daniels.</p>
      <p>A federal judge last year said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, must pay Trump nearly $293,000 for his attorneys' fees and another $1,000 in sanctions after her defamation suit against him was dismissed.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the city of Columbus reached a $450,000 settlement with Daniels over the porn actress' arrest at a strip club in 2018.</p>
      <p>Her federal lawsuit alleged officers conspired to retaliate against her over her claims she had sex with Trump before he became president.</p>
      <p>Trump's lawyers said in a Wednesday filing that Clifford owes him $293,052.</p>
      <p>Messages were left for Trump's and Daniels' attorneys.</p>
