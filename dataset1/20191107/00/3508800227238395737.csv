中國困惑（下）：為什麼「普世價值」不只是西方價值？
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by 《思想坦克》


我們想讓你知道的是為什麼過去一度被部分中國人民追求的自由、人權、民主等價值——不管稱它們是「普世價值」、「西方價值」或「核心價值」等——今天，新世代的中國人民卻放棄追求它們？這個問題我稱為「中國困惑」。

中國困惑（上）：普世價值在中國不管用？


1978年底，中國已故最高領導人鄧小平拍板決定中國應該「改革開放」，把中國建設成一個現代化國家，實現「工業、農業、國防、科技」四個現代化，從此中國走向四十年來物質國力快速增長的道路。
在改革開放最初十年，許多中國知識分子大聲呼籲中國共產黨實行第五個現代化——政治民主化，可惜並未被中共當局接受。政府拒絕與民主要求的張力，在1989年達到緊繃狀態，中國共產黨為了維持自己的統治利益，親手摧毀中國的民主幼苗，製造了「六四事件」的悲劇。然而，六四的悲劇並沒有阻止中國的經濟發展，中國仍然蛻變成一個經濟與科技強國。
這段歷史的簡短回顧是想指出：「自由」、「人權」、「民主」等「普世價值」曾經是部分中國人民追求的目標。然而，今天廣大的中國人民似乎向世人顯示：他們拒絕自由、人權、民主這些價值，他們認為那是「西方的價值」，不是「普世價值」，也不適用於中國。中國有自己的「社會主義核心價值」，像愛國、發展、和諧、穩定等。中國也講「自由、人權、民主」，但是，那些價值概念有中國自己的實踐標準：中國式的自由、人權與民主。即使如此，它們仍然遠遠比不上愛國、發展、和諧、穩定的重要性。
為什麼過去一度被部分中國人民追求的自由、人權、民主等價值——不管稱它們是「普世價值」、「西方價值」或「核心價值」等——今天，新世代的中國人民卻放棄追求它們？這個問題我稱為「中國困惑」。
中國困惑之所以會形成，部分原因是過去三十年來，中國共產黨與支持它的中國知識分子成功地推動一個「文化特殊性」的意識形態論述，它不僅為中國政府的「對外宣傳」、也為「對內控制」提供了理論基礎。
這個「文化特殊性」的論述是這樣的：西方國家所謂「自由、人權、民主」等等「普世價值」並不是真正的普世價值，它們只是西方特殊文化的反映、只是「西方價值」。它們之所以被稱作「普世價值」，是因為西方國家過去的政治經濟力量強大，形成西方文化霸權，西方挾其霸權把自己的價值推廣到全球。但它們只適用於西方文化，中國則有自己文化的特殊性，西方價值並不適於中國。
根據同樣的「邏輯」，一旦中國的政治經濟強大，中國自然也能推廣自己的文化和價值到全球，當全球有更多國家接受中國的文化價值時，中國的文化價值就有可能取代西方的文化價值而成為「普世價值」。但是，中國並不「稱霸」，中國不會干預或改變他國的內政與文化，他國（政府與人民）也不該對中國的內政說三道四、妄加議論。那是干涉中國內政，不尊重中國的特殊國情與文化，染黑中國形象。
這個「文化特殊性」的意識形態蘊涵了關於「價值」的三個論題：唯權力論、相對主義和集體主義。三者的內涵如下：
一，「價值的唯權力論」意指價值和價值推廣的基礎就是政治權力。因此，不同價值如西方價值和中國價值之間的競爭，在本質上是權力鬥爭，沒有任何客觀的理性基礎。
二，「價值的相對主義」意指價值的內涵與意義是相對於文化而決定的，不同的文化內涵會賦予同一個價值名稱不一樣的意義和標準，例如「人權」、「自由」等名稱相對於中國和西方文化有不同的意義和標準，換言之，有中國文化意義下的人權和西方文化意義下的人權。西方國家不應該以自己文化的「人權」意義和標準來看待中國的情況。
三，「價值的集體主義」是指價值應該實現在集體之上，而不是在個人之上，因為個人唯有依賴於集體才能成就其個人，這也意謂個人的生命意義在集體意志中才能彰顯。許多中國官方強調的「權利」如生存權、發展權、社會和諧、穩定、愛國（服從國家領導）等指的都是中國社會和整個中國的「權利」：中國（社會）需要生存、發展、和諧、穩定、國民服從國家的領導。在國家整體「權利」的實現之下，個人的生存、發展、人與人之間的和諧、生活的穩定才能得到保障，這樣的觀念也是中國推動中的「社會信用制度」背後的理論基礎。
基於這套思路，每當外國媒體甚至外國人民的言論，對於中國內政或中國政府違反人權的施政（如對待圖博人、維吾爾人、香港人等的措施）提出報導或評論時，中國官方和支持官方政策的人民總是對這些評論極其敏感，往往猶如被激怒的非洲犀牛般，宣稱那些評論傷害中國人民的情感。
我在〈中國困惑（上）〉一文中，理論性地駁斥了「文化特殊性」這個意識形態和它的三個子論題。然而，這個意識形態邏輯地拒絕「普世價值」的存在，主張所謂的「普世價值」不過是「西方的價值」。要徹底駁倒這個意識形態，我們也有必要積極地論證「普世價值不只是西方的價值，它們確實是普世的」，這就是本文的目標。

「價值的唯權力論」堅持：非西方國家或文化（如日本、台灣、韓國等）對於所謂「普世價值」的接受，是受到西方文化霸權的支配。因為東亞國家在「現代化」的憧憬下，接受西方的自由、人權、民主等價值，同時相信它們是西方人宣稱的普世價值。
「普世價值」最初確實是源自西方，從十七世紀起改變了西方文化和西方世界，然後隨著西方的殖民侵略行動來到世界各地。西方國家在國力強大之後，挾其科技力量，侵略、殖民、剝削其它國家，這是歷史事實，也是西方國家的歷史污點。可是，這些事實並不能證明後來非西方國家對於自由、人權、民主這些價值的接受是基於西方霸權的影響和支配，理由正是：如果我們要譴責西方國家過去的殖民歷史，唯有基於超越權力的價值判準——過去西方人的殖民行動之所以錯，正是因為那些行動牴觸、危害了那些普世價值——他們危害其他國家人民的生命、自由、財產等基本人權。
「普世價值」起於十七世紀西方這個事實，也不能支持它們只是西方的，不是普世的。我們應該把普世價值的出現，看成十七世紀西方的思想家和哲學家「發現」了它們、發現了根植在普遍人性中的內在目的。它們是人天生想擁有和追求的抽象事物：人人天生想要自由、想要生命財產與安全、想要參與決定公共事務、不想總是低人一等。
非西方國家在接受普世價值的過程中，由於傳統文化缺乏這些概念，導致產生一些不適應或不良的後果，這也是事實。但是，這些事實同樣不能證明它們不是普世的。因為西方國家在實現這些普世價值的過程中，也曾遭受更古老的西方中世紀傳統文化的抵抗。在文化價值變遷與交流的過程中，各種傳統文化確實會有保守舊文化、抗拒新文化的現象。
因此，普世價值在非西方國家的實現，同樣也會再走一趟西方國家曾經經歷的發現之旅，亦即，他們會在文化衝突的情境中「再發現」根植於自己人性中的價值。也就是說，如果一個價值確實是基於普遍人性的普世價值，那麼每一個文化的成員都可以從自己的人性去發現那些天生想追求的價值與目的。而且，如同上段所述，自由、人權、民主確實是這樣的價值。
如果某些價值確實有跨越文化的客觀性，那些「價值的（文化）相對主義」就是錯的。很多主張價值相對主義的人可能混淆它與「文化多元性」的現象。「文化多元性」是指在人類世界確實存在不同的文化，它們事實上標榜不同的價值目標，即使他們可能有一些共同的價值名稱，但也會有不同的實踐和詮釋，例如不同的文化會以不同的行為來實踐「尊重」這個價值。
可是，這種文化多元性並不會導出「普世價值」不存在，相反地，不同文化實現了一個共同的價值概念，彰顯了普世價值的跨文化性。例如「尊重」是使對方感到自己「被看重」，雖然「被看重」的形式和程度會隨文化而有所變動，但如果個人和文化都要求「尊重」，就展現了一個共同的客觀意義。而且，不管在哪個文化之內、或者在文化與文化之間，「尊重」總是相互的、互為主體的，因此也需要當事者雙方彼此磨合，而非單方面的要求。
很明顯地，當文化相對主義者要求不同的文化彼此之間應該相互尊重時，他們就至少引入了一個跨文化的價值標準——尊重。因為，「尊重」的意義不可能是單方向的，不能一方面要求其他文化的成員尊重自己文化標榜的價值（如愛國主義），自己卻不尊重其他文化標榜的價值（如言論自由）。若是如此，那就是霸權，而不是尊重。何況，如果你自己不承認「尊重」的相互性，不承認它是個跨文化的價值，也就沒有立場要求別的文化也要尊重你的文化——因為你並不接受「尊重」是彼此間相互對待應有的態度。
「西方的普世價值」也經常被說是根植於「西方個人主義」之上，而這種個人主義漠視社群與社會的重要性，不適合東方國家，因為東方的文化傳統傾向「價值的集體主義」。這是誤解。西方文化和「西方的個人主義」並沒有漠視社群與社會的重要性，而是主張一個客觀的事實：社群與社會集體應該奠基在個人之上。
集體主義經常把個人主義誤解、甚至扭曲成「孤立主義」和「利己主義」。集體主義者認為孤立主義主張一個一個在社會關係外的、孤立的、原子化的個人，忽略了個人的人格是在社會生活中被教養與塑造出來的，社會先於個人人格而存在。利己主義則主張個人在規範上應該優先追求自己的利益，如此導致漠視他人與團體的利益，危害社群的和諧與生存，最終也危害了自己。然而，這兩種主張都不是個人主義的內涵。
「價值的個人主義」同意個人人格確實是在社會中被教養與塑造的，但是這個事實並不能否定其立場的合理性，因為「價值個人主義」的核心內涵是「實現價值的主體是個人」。這裡的價值包括權利與責任，換言之，享有權利與承擔責任的主體最終都是個人。這並不是說，團體、社群、共同體、社會、整個國家等等，都不能享有權利與承擔責任。而是，當我們說一個團體、社群或國家享有某項權利或承擔某項責任時，該權利必定被全體成員所共享，該責任也必須被全體成員共同承擔。因此，集體的權利與價值，終究必須被落實在個人身上。
從上述討論可以結論：源於西方的「普世價值」，儘管是隨著西方的文化霸權而被推廣到全球，並不妨礙它們的跨文化特性。它們的普世性恰恰奠基在「基本人性」、「跨文化性」和「價值的個人主義」之上。

Chinese confusion (below): Why is ""universal value"" not just Western value?
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by ""Think Tank""


What we want you to know is the value of freedom, human rights, democracy, etc. that were once pursued by some Chinese people - whether they are ""universal values"", ""western values"" or ""core values"" - today, new The Chinese people of generations have given up on pursuing them? This issue is called ""Chinese confusion.""

Chinese confusion (on): Universal value does not work in China?


At the end of 1978, China’s late top leader Deng Xiaoping decided that China should “reform and open up”, build China into a modern country, and realize the four modernizations of “industry, agriculture, national defense, science and technology”. Since then, China has been moving rapidly for four decades. The road to growth.
In the first decade of reform and opening up, many Chinese intellectuals called out to the Chinese Communist Party to implement the fifth modernization-political democratization, but unfortunately it was not accepted by the Chinese Communist Party. The government refused to maintain the tension with the demands of democracy. In 1989, the Chinese Communist Party reached a state of tension. In order to maintain its own interests, the Chinese Communist Party personally destroyed the democratic seedlings of China and created the tragedy of the ""June 4th Incident."" However, the tragedy of the June 4th did not stop China's economic development, and China has still become an economic and technological power.
A brief review of this history is to point out that ""universal values"" such as ""freedom"", ""human rights"" and ""democracy"" were once the targets pursued by some Chinese people. However, today the vast Chinese people seem to show the world that they reject the values of freedom, human rights and democracy. They think that it is ""the value of the West"", not the ""universal value"", nor does it apply to China. China has its own ""social core values,"" such as patriotism, development, harmony, and stability. China also talks about ""freedom, human rights, democracy"", but those values have Chinese own standards of practice: Chinese-style freedom, human rights and democracy. Even so, they are still far less important than patriotism, development, harmony and stability.
Why are the values of freedom, human rights, democracy, etc. that were once pursued by some Chinese people in the past – whether they are “universal values”, “western values” or “core values” – today, the new generation of Chinese people have given up they? This issue is called ""Chinese confusion.""
Part of the reason why Chinese confusion has arisen is that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese intellectuals who supported it have succeeded in promoting an ideological discourse of ""cultural particularity"" in the past three decades. It is not only the ""foreign propaganda"" of the Chinese government, but also Provide a theoretical basis for ""inside control"".
This ""cultural particularity"" is like this: Western countries' so-called ""freedom, human rights, democracy"" and other ""universal values"" are not true universal values. They are only reflections of Western special cultures, just ""Western values."" . They are called ""universal values"" because the Western countries have strong political and economic powers in the past, forming Western cultural hegemony, and the West has its hegemony to spread its value to the world. But they only apply to Western culture, while China has its own cultural particularity, and Western values are not suitable for China.
According to the same ""logic"", once China's political economy is strong, China can naturally promote its own culture and values to the world. When more countries around the world accept China's cultural values, China's cultural values may replace the West. Cultural values have become ""universal values."" However, China does not ""hegemony"". China will not interfere or change the internal affairs and culture of other countries. Other countries (governments and people) should not make irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs. That is to interfere in China's internal affairs, not to respect China's special national conditions and culture, and to blacken China's image.
This ideology of ""cultural particularity"" contains three themes on ""value"": power, relativism and collectivism. The connotations of the three are as follows:
First, ""the authoritarian theory of value"" means that the basis for the promotion of value and value is political power. Therefore, the competition between different values, such as Western values and Chinese values, is essentially a power struggle without any objective rational basis.
Second, ""relativism of value"" means that the meaning and meaning of value are determined relative to culture. Different cultural connotations will give different meanings and standards to the same value name, such as ""human rights"" and ""freedom"". Compared with Chinese and Western cultures, they have different meanings and standards. In other words, there are human rights in the sense of Chinese culture and human rights in the sense of Western culture. Western countries should not look at China's situation with the ""human rights"" meaning and standards of their own culture.
Third, ""collectivism of value"" means that value should be achieved on the collective rather than on the individual, because individuals can only rely on the collective to achieve their individual, which means that the meaning of individual life can only be in the collective will. Highlighted. Many Chinese authorities emphasize ""rights"" such as the right to life, development, social harmony, stability, and patriotism (subject to national leadership), etc., all refer to the ""rights"" of Chinese society and China as a whole: China (society) needs to survive, develop, Harmony, stability, and national obedience to state leadership. Under the realization of the country's overall ""rights"", the survival, development, harmony between people and the stability of life can be guaranteed. This concept is also the theoretical basis behind the ""social credit system"" promoted by China.
Based on this set of ideas, whenever foreign media or even foreign people’s remarks report or comment on China’s internal affairs or Chinese government’s violations of human rights (such as measures against Tubo, Uighurs, Hong Kong people, etc.), Chinese officials and People who support official policies are always extremely sensitive to these comments, often like the irritated African rhinoceros, claiming that those comments hurt the Chinese people's feelings.
In the article ""China's Confusion (I)"", I theoretically refute the ideology of ""cultural particularity"" and its three sub-themes. However, this ideology logically rejects the existence of ""universal value"" and advocates that the so-called ""universal value"" is nothing but ""the value of the West."" To completely refute this ideology, we also need to actively argue that ""the universal value is not only the value of the West, they are indeed universal"", which is the goal of this article.

The ""power theory of value"" insists that the acceptance of the so-called ""universal values"" by non-Western countries or cultures (such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, etc.) is subject to Western cultural hegemony. Because East Asian countries accept the values of freedom, human rights, and democracy in the West under the guise of ""modernization,"" they believe that they are universal values declared by Westerners.
The ""universal value"" originally originated from the West. It changed the Western culture and the Western world from the 17th century and then came to the world with Western colonial aggression. After the country’s powerful national power, Western countries have invaded their scientific and technological forces, invaded, colonized and exploited other countries. This is a historical fact and a historical stain of Western countries. However, these facts do not prove that the acceptance of the values of freedom, human rights and democracy by non-Western countries was based on the influence and domination of Western hegemony. The reason is: if we want to condemn the past colonial history of Western countries, only based on transcendence of power The value of the judgment - the mistakes of Western colonial action in the past, precisely because those actions touched and endangered the universal values - they endanger the basic human rights of people, life, freedom and property in other countries.
The fact that ""universal values"" originated in the West in the seventeenth century cannot support them as Western only, not universal. We should regard the emergence of universal values as the 17th century Western thinkers and philosophers ""discovered"" them and discovered the inner purpose rooted in universal humanity. They are abstract things that people want to own and pursue: everyone wants freedom, wants life, property, and safety, wants to participate in deciding public affairs, and doesn't want to be inferior.
It is also true that non-Western countries in the process of accepting universal values, because traditional culture lacks these concepts, resulting in some unacceptable or undesirable consequences. However, these facts also cannot prove that they are not universal. Because Western countries have also resisted the older Western medieval traditional culture in the process of realizing these universal values. In the process of cultural value changes and exchanges, various traditional cultures do have the phenomenon of conserving old culture and resisting new culture.
Therefore, the realization of universal values in non-Western countries will also take a trip to the discovery journey that Western countries have experienced, that is, they will “rediscover” the value rooted in their own humanity in the context of cultural conflicts. . That is to say, if a value is indeed based on the universal value of universal humanity, then members of each culture can discover the values and purposes that they are naturally seeking from their own humanity. Moreover, as stated in the previous paragraph, freedom, human rights, and democracy are indeed such values.
If certain values do have objectivity across cultures, those ""valued (cultural) relativism"" are wrong. Many people who advocate value relativism may confuse it with the phenomenon of ""cultural pluralism."" ""Cultural pluralism"" means that there are different cultures in the human world. They actually advertise different value objectives. Even if they may have some common value names, they will have different practices and interpretations, such as different cultural associations. Practice the value of ""respect"" with different behaviors.
However, this cultural diversity does not lead to the absence of “universal values”. On the contrary, different cultures have realized a common concept of values, demonstrating the cross-cultural value of universal values. For example, ""respect"" means that the other party feels that he is ""valued"". Although the form and degree of ""being valued"" will change with culture, if both individual and culture require ""respect"", it shows a common objective meaning. . Moreover, ""respect"" is always mutual and mutual, no matter in which culture or between culture and culture. Therefore, it is also necessary for the parties to work together, rather than unilaterally.
Obviously, when cultural relativists demand that different cultures should respect each other, they introduce at least a cross-cultural value standard – respect. Because the meaning of ""respect"" cannot be unidirectional. On the one hand, members of other cultures are not required to respect the value of their cultural ostentation (such as patriotism), but they do not respect the value of other cultural slogans (such as freedom of speech). If so, it is hegemony, not respect. What's more, if you don't recognize the mutual respect of ""respect"" and don't recognize it as a cross-cultural value, there is no position to ask other cultures to respect your culture - because you don't accept ""respect"" and treat each other. Due attitude.
""The universal value of the West"" is often said to be rooted in ""Western individualism"", and this individualism ignores the importance of the community and society, and is not suitable for the Eastern countries, because the cultural traditions of the East tend to ""the collective of values."" Doctrine."" This is a misunderstanding. Western culture and ""Western individualism"" do not ignore the importance of the community and society, but advocate an objective fact: the community and the social collective should be based on the individual.
Collectivism often misunderstands and even distorts individualism into ""isolationism"" and ""egoism."" Collectivists believe that isolationism advocates an isolated, atomized individual outside of social relations, ignoring that individual personality is cultivated and shaped in social life, and society exists before personal personality. Self-interestism advocates that individuals should give priority to their own interests in terms of norms, which leads to disregard the interests of others and groups, endangering the harmony and survival of the community, and ultimately endangering themselves. However, these two claims are not the connotations of individualism.
""Value individualism"" agrees that individual personality is indeed nurtured and shaped in society, but this fact does not negate the rationality of its position, because the core connotation of ""value individualism"" is that ""the subject of value realization is an individual"" . The values here include rights and responsibilities. In other words, the subjects who enjoy rights and assume responsibility are ultimately individuals. This is not to say that groups, communities, communities, society, the whole country, etc. cannot enjoy rights and assume responsibility. Rather, when we say that a group, community, or state has a certain right or assumes a certain responsibility, that right must be shared by all members, and that responsibility must also be shared by all members. Therefore, collective rights and values must ultimately be implemented on individuals.
From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the “universal values” originating from the West, although they are promoted globally with Western cultural hegemony, do not hinder their cross-cultural characteristics. Their universality is based on ""basic humanity,"" ""interculturalism,"" and ""value individualism.""
