      <h1>Collins English Dictionary names 'climate strike' as word of the year</h1>
      <h2>The 2019 edition of the respected dictionary also recognises the word 'non-binary' for the first time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:18:24+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 00:18</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Green</a></address>
      <p>The word “non-binary” has been recognised by Collins dictionary for the first time.</p>
      <p>The respected online edition also named “climate strike” as its word of the year for 2019.</p>
      <p>It follows pop star Sam Smith coming out as non-binary and 16-year-old Greta Thunberg launching a global environmental movement.</p>
      <p>Bosses said “non-binary” was now part of the English lexicon and it recognised “changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves”.</p>
      <p>A person who identifies as non-binary does not define themselves exclusively as masculine or feminine. They often prefer they/them pronouns, rather than he/she.</p>

      <p>Collins’ definition reads, “relating to a gender or sexual identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female, heterosexual or homosexual”.</p>
      <p>Smith was among the first celebrities to ask the public to refer to them using they/them.</p>
      <p>Laura Russell, of LGBT charity Stonewall, said: “It’s great that Collins will officially be adding non-binary to their dictionary.</p>
      <p>“It’s important more organisations and people use language that includes everyone and recognises who they are.”</p>
      <p>Climate strikes are part of a growing movement sparked by Thunberg’s school strikes outside the Swedish parliament.</p>
