      <p>SEATTLE (AP) - The restaurant empire of Seattle chef Tom Douglas will pay $2.4 million to more than 1,000 current and former employees after settling a class-action lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-seattle-times/">Seattle Times</a> reports the suit against the operator of Dahlia Lounge, Palace Kitchen, Brave Horse Tavern and more than a dozen other local eateries accused the restaurants of not disclosing how much of a 20% service fee billed to customers went to the service workers and of not providing substantial rest and meal breaks.</p>
      <p>When Seattle increased its minimum wage from $9.19 to $15 in 2015, some restaurants instituted a “surcharge” or “service fee” they claimed would offset the burden of paying their service workers $15. Tom Douglas Seattle Kitchen implemented a service fee of 20% of a customer’s bill across its restaurants.</p>
      <p>Tom Douglas Seattle Kitchen denied any wrongdoing in the settlement.</p>
