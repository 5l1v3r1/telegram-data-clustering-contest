放棄使用「黃金時代」，荷蘭博物館群在「去殖民」過程遭遇哪些困境？
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是阿姆斯特丹博物館於其聲明稿表示，「黃金時代」一詞在西方史學佔有重要的地位，與荷蘭的民族自豪感息息相關。但在這展示「繁榮、和平和富裕時代」的詞彙中，並沒有涵蓋過去應該負起的歷史責任，也忽略了當時社會現實的許多消極面。

博物館為一個具有批判性的非營利專業組織，它可以批評時事、歷史以表達多元觀點和聲音，來提供觀眾不同角度的面相和思考；同樣地，博物館也可以自我批判，勇於正視國家過去不光彩的歷史，並促進多元對話。
今年9月荷蘭阿姆斯特丹博物館（Amsterdam Museum）宣布不再使用「黃金時代」一詞，並更改常設展名稱的例子，引發一連串荷蘭政壇的爭論，凸顯了身處「後殖民時代」的荷蘭博物館群在「去殖民（decolonisation）」的過程中，所遭遇到的現實困境。
荷蘭的黃金時代（Golden Age）
「黃金時代」被譽為荷蘭國力的巔峰，係指17世紀時，荷蘭於商業貿易、科學技術、軍事武力和藝術領域等方面都取得了積極的發展，為國內帶來了一片令人矚目、欣欣向榮的景象，且在世界史上佔有舉足輕重的地位。最著名的荷蘭東印度公司（VOC）、藝術家林布蘭（Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn）和維梅爾（Johannes Vermeer）等，都是這時期的代表之一。

博物館放棄使用「黃金時代」，是展現包容性並容納多元聲音的一步
荷蘭阿姆斯特丹博物館9月份於其官方網站上公告，同時發出相關新聞稿宣布博物館將不再使用「黃金時代（Golden Age）」一詞。
阿姆斯特丹博物館於其聲明稿表示，「黃金時代」一詞在西方史學佔有重要的地位，與荷蘭的民族自豪感息息相關。但在這展示「繁榮、和平和富裕時代」的詞彙中，並沒有涵蓋過去應該負起的歷史責任，也忽略了當時社會現實的許多消極面，如：貧窮、戰爭、人口買賣和強迫勞動的奴隸制度等。「黃金時代」一詞是從當權者的角度來詮釋歷史，粉飾了荷蘭歷史不公義的一面。博物館認為，每一個世代、每一個人都應該要能詮釋和形成自己的歷史故事，而該詞彙（指「黃金時代」）本身限制了不同聲音的對話空間，框限了講述更多故事的可能。
博物館將放棄使用「黃金時代」一詞，這是博物館達到包容性和容納多元聲音的一步。博物館多年來與當地社群和民眾共同努力，希望讓博物館成為一個「屬於每個人」與「每個人息息相關」的地方，使其感到認同，因此，希望透過這個決定，為過去被忽略或是沒有發聲權的多元族群提供重新對話和講述故事的空間。此外，也決定將館內其中一個常設展名稱「黃金時代的荷蘭人（Dutch of the Golden Age）」改為「17世紀的集體肖像（Group Portraits of the 17th century）」
荷蘭政壇對於博物館的作為表示不認同
不過當阿姆斯特丹博物館發布此消息後，立即受到國內政壇各方的強烈反彈。
荷蘭首相Mark Rutte表示不認同博物館的做法，認為「黃金時代」是一個美麗的名詞，「我們不應該要浪費我們的時間精力去重新命名黃金時代這個詞，我們可以談論過去不好的地方，但我們應該要去創造我們新的黃金時代（Let’s not waste our energy on renaming the Golden Age － a beautiful term. We can talk about what wasn’t good, but let’s devote our energies to creating a new Golden Age）」。
荷蘭議員Zohair El Yassini重批博物館這種做法是荒腔走板（lost the plot completely），並表示博物館有責任解釋黃金時代的負面影響，這本來就是博物館的職責，而非直接棄用這個詞彙。更有其他官員指控博物館試圖改寫歷史。
社交媒體Twitter上，民眾反應不一，有人稱讚博物館走向更具包容性和更全面的觀點；也有人批評博物館試圖抹煞這個國家最具影響力的歷史時代。
荷蘭國家博物館（Rijksmuseum）表示不會跟進
同樣位於阿姆斯特丹的荷蘭國家博物館表示不會跟進阿姆斯特丹博物館的腳步，並且不會疏遠「黃金時代」這個詞彙。國家博物館館長Taco Dibbits解釋，「黃金時代是荷蘭歷史上一段光輝繁榮的時期，使用它並不代表我們不承認這個時代不光彩的歷史事實，國家博物館將嘗試用不同的角度去詮釋這段歷史，我們明年將在博物館內舉辦以奴隸貿易為主題的展覽」。

阿姆斯特丹博物館的回應
受到抨擊的阿姆斯特丹博物館館長Judikje Kiers表示，將持續努力達到更平衡的歷史觀點，很多地方可能還沒有辦法立即到位。不過，這是博物館邁向更包容和多元聲音的重要的一步，他們將繼續與當地居民和社群合作，以發現共同歷史中不足的故事與觀點。
荷蘭博物館的後殖民時代
近年來荷蘭一直對其過去歷史進行批判，特別是殖民時代。根據萊頓大學非洲研究中心（Leiden University’s African Studies Center）指出，荷蘭自17世紀起參與大西洋奴隸貿易，持續了200多年，曾在非洲黃金海岸（今迦納共和國）建立要塞據點，並抓捕和販運當地的非裔人民至各地進行奴役，其奴隸貿易人次達60多萬，這種剝削行為為當時國家賺取了豐厚的利潤且壯大了國力。
這幾年荷蘭博物館群積極正視過去的殖民黑歷史，例如：荷蘭國家博物館於2015年起刪除其館藏內可能含有種族歧視的標籤或言語，像是negro（羞辱非裔族群的用字）、Indian、dwarf、Hottentot（荷蘭給南非Khoi人的稱呼，荷蘭語意為口吃的人，極具污辱性）等。
而收藏維梅爾名作《戴著珍珠耳環的少女（Girl with a Pearl Earring）》的Mauritshuis皇家美術館，2018 年撤下館內展示之過去官員Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen的半胸像——歷史上透過奴隸貿易賺進巨大財富的殖民地官員。即使該館長Emilie Gordenker解釋，因為該胸像為複製品，其後代正在建立另一個有關Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen的博物館，可以展示原始胸像，加上撤掉該胸像有助於改善美術館講述過去荷蘭歷史正反兩面的詮釋，仍受到政壇猛烈批評，被認為是「用今天先入為主的觀念來批判遙遠的過去」且「過於敏感」。

結語
博物館身處於去殖民化的辯論和後殖民時代中，都應具備自我批判的能力，不斷地滾動式調整。唯有如此，博物館的權威觀念才能被解構並打破，以容納更多元的聲音。
無論你／妳贊同上述何種說法，博物館應設法擺脫自我中心與殖民主義的先決條件，雖然這個過程會非常的艱難，也會牽涉許多定義範圍和權力結構等複雜面。不過這仍是博物館應持續去正視和挑戰的課題，將博物館視為一個學習型社群，而非一個無懈可擊的權威中心，透過與不同社群對話的過程，去重新構思一個可以被理解的多元視角，展現出文化和歷史詮釋的無限可能，否則博物館將僅僅是殖民主義的複製品。
阿姆斯特丹博物館的嘗試或許在短時間內我們還沒辦法給予過多的評價，不過可以肯定的是該博物館團隊自我批判及打開對話的努力。正如台灣博物館界的張譽騰前輩於〈三十年磨一劍+《博物館法》的回顧與前瞻〉所言，「博物館是與時俱進的行業……更重要的，是個別博物館的自覺、自省和自我改善的意願……博物館要有能力實施自我意識改革」，阿姆斯特丹博物館已經給了我們一個博物館嘗試實施「自覺、自省和自我改善」的具體例子。

Abandoning the use of the ""Golden Age"", what difficulties did the Dutch museum group encounter in the process of ""decolonization""?
07 Nov 2019, 00:26 by readers


What we want you to know is that the Amsterdam Museum stated in its statement that the term ""Golden Age"" has an important place in Western history and is closely related to the Dutch national pride. However, in the vocabulary of ""prosperity, peace and prosperity"", it does not cover the historical responsibility that should be taken in the past, and ignores many negative aspects of social reality at that time.



Text: Guo Yizhen
The museum is a critical non-profit professional organization that can criticize current affairs and history to express multiple perspectives and voices to provide viewers with different perspectives and reflections. Similarly, museums can also criticize themselves and face the country's past disgrace. History and promote multi-faceted dialogue.
In September this year, the Amsterdam Museum announced that it would no longer use the term “Golden Age” and change the name of the permanent exhibition, sparking a series of debates in the Dutch political arena, highlighting the Dutch museum group in the “post-colonial era”. The real dilemma encountered in the process of ""decolonisation"".
The Golden Age of the Netherlands
The ""Golden Age"" is known as the peak of the Dutch national strength. It means that in the 17th century, the Netherlands has made positive developments in commercial trade, science and technology, military force and art. It has brought a remarkable eye to the country. A thriving scene and a pivotal position in world history. The most famous Dutch East India Company (VOC), artists Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer are among the representatives of this period.

The museum’s abandonment of the “Golden Age” is a step to show inclusiveness and accommodate multiple voices.
The Amsterdam Museum in the Netherlands announced on its official website in September and issued a press release announcing that the museum will no longer use the term ""Golden Age"".
The Amsterdam Museum stated in its statement that the term “Golden Age” has an important place in Western history and is closely related to Dutch national pride. But in the vocabulary of ""prosperity, peace and prosperity"", it does not cover the historical responsibility that should be taken in the past, and ignores many negative aspects of social reality at that time, such as poverty, war, human trafficking and forced labor. Slavery and so on. The term ""golden age"" interprets history from the perspective of those in power and whitewashes the unjust aspects of Dutch history. The museum believes that every generation and every person should be able to interpret and form their own historical stories, and the vocabulary (referring to the ""Golden Age"") itself limits the dialogue space of different voices, and limits the possibility of telling more stories.
The museum will abandon the use of the term ""Golden Age"", which is a step in the museum's inclusiveness and versatility. The museum has worked with the local community and the people for many years, hoping to make the museum a place where “everyone belongs” and “everyone is closely related” and feels that it is recognized. Therefore, it is hoped that this decision will be ignored or not for the past. The multi-ethnic community of voices provides room for re-conversation and storytelling. In addition, it was decided to change the name of one of the permanent exhibitions, ""Dutch of the Golden Age"" to ""Group Portraits of the 17th Century"".
Dutch political circles do not agree with the museum’s work
However, when the Amsterdam Museum released this news, it immediately received a strong rebound from all parties in the domestic political arena.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that he does not agree with the museum's practice and believes that the ""Golden Age"" is a beautiful term. ""We should not waste our time and energy to rename the word golden age. We can talk about bad places in the past, but Let's not waste our energy on renaming the Golden Age - a beautiful term. We can talk about what wasn't good, but let's devote our energies to creating a new Golden Age).
The Dutch parliamentary Zohair El Yassini's re-approval of the museum is a lot of the plot, and it is said that the museum has the responsibility to explain the negative effects of the golden age, which is the responsibility of the museum, rather than directly abandoning the term. More officials accused the museum of trying to rewrite history.
On social media Twitter, the public reacted differently, some praised the museum for a more inclusive and more comprehensive view; others criticized the museum for trying to erase the country's most influential historical era.
The Dutch National Museum (Rijksmuseum) said it would not follow up
The Dutch National Museum, also located in Amsterdam, said it would not follow the footsteps of the Amsterdam Museum and would not alienate the term “Golden Age”. National Museum Director Taco Dibbits explained, ""The Golden Age is a period of glorious prosperity in the history of the Netherlands. Using it does not mean that we do not recognize the historical facts of this era. The National Museum will try to interpret this history from different angles. An exhibition on the theme of slave trade will be held in the museum next year.""

Amsterdam Museum's response
Judikje Kiers, curator of the Amsterdam Museum, said that he will continue to work hard to achieve a more balanced historical perspective, and there may be no way to get it right in many places. However, this is an important step for the museum to move towards more inclusive and diverse voices, and they will continue to work with local residents and communities to discover stories and perspectives that are not common in common history.
The post-colonial era of the Dutch Museum
The Netherlands has been criticizing its past history in recent years, especially in the colonial era. According to the Leiden University's African Studies Center, the Netherlands has been involved in the Atlantic slave trade since the 17th century. It has been in existence for more than 200 years and has established a stronghold in the African Gold Coast (present-day Ghana Republic) and arrested and The local African-American people were trafficked to various places for slavery. The number of slave traders reached more than 600,000. This exploitation made the country earn a lucrative profit and strengthened its national strength.
In the past few years, the Dutch museum group has actively confronted the past colonial black history. For example, the National Museum of the Netherlands has deleted labels or words from its collection that may contain racial discrimination in 2015, such as negro (swearing the words of African-American ethnic groups), Indian , dwarf, Hottentot (the Dutch name for the Khoi in South Africa, Dutch means stuttering, very humiliating).
And the Mauritshuis Royal Art Museum, which is a collection of Vimer's masterpiece ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", was removed from the semi-breasted image of past official Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen in 2018 - historically through slaves Trade colonial officials who earned enormous wealth. Even though the curator Emilie Gordenker explained that because the bust is a replica, his descendants are building another museum about Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen that can showcase the original bust and remove the bust to help improve the museum's past Dutch history. The interpretation of both sides is still strongly criticized by the political arena and is considered to be ""to over-sensitive"" with the concept of today's preconceived ideas to criticize the distant past.

Conclusion
In the decolonization debate and the post-colonial era, the museum should have the ability to self-criticize and constantly adjust to it. Only in this way can the museum's authoritative concept be deconstructed and broken to accommodate more yuan.
Regardless of what you agree with, the museum should try to get rid of the preconditions of self-centeredness and colonialism. Although this process will be very difficult, it will involve many complex aspects such as the scope of definition and power structure. However, this is still the topic that museums should continue to face and challenge. The museum is regarded as a learning community rather than an impeccable authority center. Through the process of dialogue with different communities, we can re-conceive a diversity that can be understood. The perspective reveals the infinite possibilities of cultural and historical interpretations, otherwise the museum will be merely a replica of colonialism.
The Amsterdam Museum's attempt may not give us too much comment in a short period of time, but what is certain is the museum team's self-criticism and open dialogue efforts. As Zhang Yuteng’s predecessors in the Taiwanese museum community said in the ""Review and Prospect of the 30-Year Grinding and Sword + Museum Law"", ""Museums are an industry that keeps pace with the times... More importantly, the conscious and introspective of individual museums. And the willingness to self-improvement...the museum must be able to implement self-awareness reforms.” The Amsterdam Museum has given us a concrete example of a museum trying to implement “consciousness, self-examination and self-improvement”.
