The Justice Department charged two former Twitter employees with spying on behalf of Saudi Arabia by exploiting their access to confidential information on users stored by the social media company.
It’s the first time federal prosecutors have charged Saudis with spying inside the United States.
The Justice Department charged Ahmad Abouammo, an American, and Ali Alzabarah, a Saudi citizen, on Wednesday. A third person, Ahmed Almutairi, a Saudi citizen, was also charged. Almutairi previously ran a marketing company that was paid by the Saudi royal family.
Abouammo is alleged to have spied on the Twitter accounts of three users on behalf of Riyadh, according to the criminal complaint. Alzabarah was accused of accessing the personal information linked to more than 6,000 Twitter accounts on behalf of the country. One of those accounts belonged to a prominent dissident.
Prosecutors said Almutairi acted as an intermediary between the Twitter employees and Saudi officials.
Abouammo was arrested Tuesday in Seattle. Alzabarah and Almutairi are believed to be in Saudi Arabia.
