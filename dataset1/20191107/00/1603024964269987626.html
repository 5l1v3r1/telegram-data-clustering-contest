      <p>US printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp has made a roughly $33 billion (Â£25.67 billion) cash-and-stock offer for personal computer maker HP Inc , a company more than three times its size, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>HP confirmed the bid, but declined to disclose the offer price. The companies have explored a combination from time to time, and HP will consider Xerox's latest proposal "with an eye towards what is in the best interest of all our shareholders," HP said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Five days ago Enrique Lores, former president of HP's imaging and printing business, officially took over as its chief executive.</p>

      <p>Xerox's stock has rallied under CEO John Visentin, who took over last year and resolved a long-running dispute with joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp .</p>
      <p>Xerox said on Tuesday it would sell its 25% stake in the joint venture for $2.3 billion. Fujifilm agreed to drop a lawsuit against Xerox. With the dispute behind it and more cash in hand, Xerox set its sights on HP.</p>
      <p>Xerox has offered to acquire HP for between $22 and $23 per share, to be paid in cash and stock, the sources said. To help fund the cash portion of the deal, Xerox has lined up financing from Citigroup Inc , the sources said.</p>
      <p>Xerox believes it can achieve at least $2 billion in annual cost synergies by creating an office technology supplies giant, one of the sources said. HP will spend a few days considering the offer before responding, another source added.</p>
      <p>The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.</p>
      <p>Xerox and Citigroup did not respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Xerox was preparing a bid for HP.</p>
      <p>HP shares closed 6.4% higher at $19.57 in New York on Wednesday. Xerox shares rose 3.6% to $37.66, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Many analysts said there was merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.</p>
      <p>"We would be left to question Xerox's ability to finance such a large transaction and the potential overlap the two businesses would face," Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note.</p>
      <p>Xerox had scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from two major investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who went on to overthrow its board.</p>
      <p>HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division's third-quarter revenue dropping 5% on-year. It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.</p>
      <p>This is not the first deal that Icahn has tried to orchestrate by having a small company buy a bigger one. In June, U.S. casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc agreed to acquire larger peer Caesars Entertainment Corp for $17.3 billion, including debt.</p>
      <p>Icahn had earlier gained seats on the board of Caesars.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
