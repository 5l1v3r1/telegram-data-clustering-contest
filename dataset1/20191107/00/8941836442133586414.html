      <p>BOSTON (AP) - The vaping industry has dropped its federal lawsuit challenging Massachusetts’ temporary ban on the sale of vaping products while a separate suit advances in state court.</p>
      <p>The Vapor Technology Association filed notice late Wednesday dismissing its lawsuit in Boston federal court. The D.C.-based group is still challenging Massachusetts’ ban in state court.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins recently issued rulings in the case that the state has appealed. The state’s highest court has agreed to hear arguments next month.</p>
      <p>The industry argues the ban will destroy Massachusetts’ $331 million nicotine vapor products industry and irreparably harm local businesses.</p>
      <p>Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s office declined to comment on the federal case’s dismissal.</p>
