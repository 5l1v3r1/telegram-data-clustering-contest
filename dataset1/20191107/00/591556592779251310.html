        <b>Company turns around 1H18 loss to post NZ$1.3 million in after-tax profit for the first-half of 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xero has remained in the black for a second consecutive half, reporting that net profit after tax reached NZ$1.3 million. Year on year, the result is up nearly NZ$30 million compared to the six months to 30 September 2018, which recorded a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-falls-deeper-into-the-red-with-nz28-6m-h1-loss/">NZ$19.6 million loss</a>.  <br/><br/>The cloud accounting firm also indicated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation excluding impairments hit nearly NZ$66 million, almost <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-has-bigger-losses-as-it-grows-revenue-by-36-percent/">double the NZ$34.5 million</a> that was reported in the previous period.<br/><br/>Operating revenue, meanwhile, was up 32% year on year, reaching close to NZ$339 million.<br/><br/>The company also announced it tipped passed the 2 million global subscribers mark, with global subscribers increasing by 478,000 during the period.<br/><br/>Concurrently, total subscriber lifetime value grew by 37% to NZ$5.4 billion, with more than NZ$1 billion added during this half-year period.</p>
      <p>"While it took more than a decade to add Xero's first million subscribers, it took just two and a half years to add the next million, demonstrating the pace of Xero's adoption across a number of markets," Xero told shareholders on Thursday.<br/><br/>On a region-by-region basis, the United Kingdom saw the most significant growth in terms of subscriber and revenue numbers. Subscribers grew by 51% compared to the same period last year to 536,000, while revenue also grew 51%.</p>
      <p>The company attributed the growth to its ongoing investment in the market, which was marked by the opening of a third office in the country. <br/><br/>Meanwhile in Australia, subscribers grew 28% compared to the same period last year, which saw the half-year end with 840,000 subscribers, while revenue went up 26%. Xero said the implementation of the Australia Taxation Office's single touch payroll initiative has contributed to the demand for cloud accounting in the market. <br/><br/>For New Zealand, subscriber numbers saw a 13% increase compared to the last year to 367,000, with revenue rising by 22%. <br/><br/>"Favourable average revenue per user (ARPU) trends were driven by a greater emphasis on additional platform solutions including Xero Payroll which benefited from the introduction of Payday filing by Inland Revenue on 1 April 2019 and the adoption by existing customers of higher value and function subscriptions," the company said.<br/><br/>North American subscriber numbers lifted by 21% to 215,000, while revenue increased by 34%.<br/><br/>Rest of the world markets now have 99,000 subscribers, which was led mainly by South Africa, Hong Kong, and Singapore. <br/><br/>Xero also upped its head count during the six months to just over 2,700 staff. <br/><br/>On new hires, the New Zealand-based company announced during the period the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/former-telstra-ibm-australia-ceo-david-thodey-adds-xero-to-board-interests/">appointment of David Thodey</a> as its latest non-executive board member.<br/><br/>During the six months, Xero also <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-boosts-data-flow-with-machine-learning-capabilities/">bolstered its machine learning capabilities</a> for document processing and extraction using technology from Hubdoc, a company that the cloud accounting firm <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/xero-scoops-up-hubdoc-in-70-million-acquisition/">acquired last year for $70 million</a>.<br/><br/>"We continue to invest in Xero's platform and made significant progress on our strategy in the first six months of our 2020 financial year," Xero said. <br/><br/>"We have been investing heavily in technologies to support our platform, which will help Xero rapidly scale so we can deliver customer value and meet our growth ambitions."</p>
