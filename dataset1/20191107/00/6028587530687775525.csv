The Surface Pro line of 2-in-1 devices offers a super-thin design that makes it perfect for students or professionals on the go, but that thing design doesn’t necessarily translate to low performance. In fact, the Surface Pro 6 is now available for $300 off its normal price, straight from Best Buy.

The new Apple iPad boasts Apple’s A10 Fusion chip, along with options for either 32GB or 128GB of storage and a classic iPad design. Sure, it doesn’t look as modern as the iPad Pro, but even the older iPad design still looks great. With those specs, you can use the iPad for web browsing, social media, watching shows on Netflix, and more. 
While the iPad is normally available starting at $329, but it’s currently available on Amazon for $30 off its normal price, bringing the total to $299. That’s a pretty incredible price for a device that’s so powerful and versatile. 



Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1

The iPad is largely considered to be the most popular tablet on the market, but if you’re firmly in the Android ecosystem, it’s probably worth considering the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 instead.

The device is also pretty sleek and stylish, plus it plugs into your Google account, so it’ll integrate with your other Android devices.

E-Readers
Kindle Paperwhite


All-new Kindle Paperwhite – Now Waterproof with 2x the Storage

Just last week, Amazon announced the newly updated Kindle Paperwhite, which has arguably been the best affordable e-reader on the market for years now. Now, you can take the device anywhere with peace of mind, thanks to its waterproof design, Wi-Fi + free cellular connectivity and weeks of battery life. Now with Audible, the device lets you switch from reading to listening through Bluetooth-enabled speakers or headphones at the touch of a button, making it the perfect commuting or travel partner.
Available as of November 7, the e-reader is currently listed for $130 on Amazon. While the device itself isn’t on sale, if you already own a Kindle, you can currently trade it in for a discount on the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite. If your device meets their standards, you’ll receive a 25 percent promotional discount toward the new Kindle plus an Amazon.com Gift Card equal to the appraised value of your Kindle. It's the equivalent of finding forgotten money in your coat pocket. Now is the time to root around your tech drawer for your outdated e-readers (even non-working devices are eligible).

Kindle Oasis


Kindle Oasis
