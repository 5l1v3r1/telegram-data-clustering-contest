      <p>Markets regulator SEBI's decision to allow Aadhaar as e-KYC for mutual fund investments will be a shot in the arm for the MF industry as it will reduce time for client onboarding and boost mutual fund penetration, feel experts.</p>
      <p>On November 5, SEBI issued a detailed circular regarding the process to be followed for Aadhaar-based electronic KYC exercise for domestic investors.</p>
      <p>The circular mentions about the requirements to be fulfilled by entities registered with the UIDAI as KYC User Agency (KUA) as well as for sub-KUA.</p>
      <p>"This is a step in the right direction as we had noticed lot of investors discontinuing SIPs after Aadhaar was disallowed to be used as e-KYC," said Narendra Sinha, a Mumbai-based distributor.</p>
      <p>SEBI in its last circular had mentioned that Aadhaar-based e-KYC investors can only invest up to Rs 50,000 in a financial year. This time around, SEBI has not made a mention of an upper limit for Aadhar-based KYC investors making investments.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, Supreme Court banned the use of Aadhaar data for financial transactions. This means a Permanent Account Number (PAN) is mandatory for every investor KYC.</p>
      <p>As per latest data, till July 2018, 1.22 billion Aadhar cards were existing, equal to 90 percent of population.</p>
      <p>Aadhaar-based KYC helps reach 90 percent of India like a banking outreach.</p>
      <p>Aadhaar becoming a one-stop access to capital markets investment like MF, should ease buisness for rural and small town focussed MFs like Mahindra Mutual Fund and PSU bank-promoted MFs that have large number of small town branches.</p>
      <p>"PSU bank mutual funds must gain great subscription as small account holders in small towns are already mapped through Aadhaar to their bank accounts a ready made client base," said a distributor.</p>
      <p>Converting these clients to long-term SIP subscribers would depend on how well the bank branches cross sell alongside small town distribution - the plain vanilla diversified equities.</p>
      <p>At this stage, initially MFs should not be selling risky sectoral or volatile small cap funds as any downturn will put off the small town investor .</p>
      <p>The risky products should be pushed to a later stage.</p>
      <p>"In 2006-07, SEBI was first regulator to make PAN mandatory for securities market transactions, now putting Aadhar as E KYC for all without limits, SEBI has achieved 2 targets - ensuring best standardsÂ  PMLA compliance and reaching out to smallest investor at end of tail," said a former SEBI DGM who worked in its MF department.</p>
