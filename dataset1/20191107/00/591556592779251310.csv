Year on year, the result is up nearly NZ$30 million compared to the six months to 30 September 2018, which recorded a NZ$19.6 million loss.  The cloud accounting firm also indicated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation excluding impairments hit nearly NZ$66 million, almost double the NZ$34.5 million that was reported in the previous period.Operating revenue, meanwhile, was up 32% year on year, reaching close to NZ$339 million.The company also announced it tipped passed the 2 million global subscribers mark, with global subscribers increasing by 478,000 during the period.Concurrently, total subscriber lifetime value grew by 37% to NZ$5.4 billion, with more than NZ$1 billion added during this half-year period.
""While it took more than a decade to add Xero's first million subscribers, it took just two and a half years to add the next million, demonstrating the pace of Xero's adoption across a number of markets,"" Xero told shareholders on Thursday.On a region-by-region basis, the United Kingdom saw the most significant growth in terms of subscriber and revenue numbers. Subscribers grew by 51% compared to the same period last year to 536,000, while revenue also grew 51%.
The company attributed the growth to its ongoing investment in the market, which was marked by the opening of a third office in the country. Meanwhile in Australia, subscribers grew 28% compared to the same period last year, which saw the half-year end with 840,000 subscribers, while revenue went up 26%. Xero said the implementation of the Australia Taxation Office's single touch payroll initiative has contributed to the demand for cloud accounting in the market. For New Zealand, subscriber numbers saw a 13% increase compared to the last year to 367,000, with revenue rising by 22%. ""Favourable average revenue per user (ARPU) trends were driven by a greater emphasis on additional platform solutions including Xero Payroll which benefited from the introduction of Payday filing by Inland Revenue on 1 April 2019 and the adoption by existing customers of higher value and function subscriptions,"" the company said.North American subscriber numbers lifted by 21% to 215,000, while revenue increased by 34%.Rest of the world markets now have 99,000 subscribers, which was led mainly by South Africa, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
