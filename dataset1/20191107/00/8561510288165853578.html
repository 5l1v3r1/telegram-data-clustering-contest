      <h1>Italy Will Soon Force Public Schools to Teach Climate Change</h1>

      <h3>New School</h3>
      <p>Starting in September 2020, every public school student in Italy will study climate change for 33 hours per year — nearly one hour per school week.</p>
      <p>“The entire ministry is being changed to make sustainability and climate the center of the education model,” Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-italy-exclusive/exclusive-italy-to-make-climate-change-study-compulsory-in-schools-idUSKBN1XF1E1">told <i>Reuters</i></a>. “I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school.”</p>
      <h3>Trojan Horse</h3>
      <p>Once the new changes go into effect, Italy will be the first nation in the world to make climate change required learning for students.</p>
      <p>The focus won’t be limited to studying climate change directly. Italy’s schools will also look for ways to apply a message of sustainability to traditional subjects, Fioramonti <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/europe/italy-schools-climate-change.html">told <i>The New York Times</i></a> — in geography class, for example, students might learn about how human actions impact various parts of the Earth.</p>
      <h3>Class Act</h3>
      <p>Fioramonti told the <i>NYT</i> that “the 21st century citizen must be a sustainable citizen,” and this isn’t the first time he’s stressed the importance of young people being active in climate change issues.</p>
      <p>In September, he actually <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-italy/strike-for-the-climate-italys-education-minister-tells-students-idUSKBN1W828G">encouraged Italy’s students</a> to skip school — so they could participate in climate protests.</p>
