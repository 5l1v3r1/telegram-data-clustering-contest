      <p>The company said a challenging operating environment with continuing weak consumer sentiment had impacted the travel segment primarily in the outbound and domestic businesses.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the financial performance, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd Chairman and Managing Director Madhavan Menon said, "This has been a challenging quarter for the travel industry with the collapse of Jet Airways leading to a surge in airfares, as well as the negative impact on customers and to the entire Indian Travel industry caused by the closure of Cox &amp; Kings."</p>
