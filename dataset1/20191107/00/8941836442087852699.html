      <p>BEREA, Ohio (AP) - A person familiar with the negotiations says Cleveland Browns center JC Tretter has agreed to terms on a three-year, $32.5 million contract extension with the club.</p>
      <p>Tretter, who is in his third season with the Browns, will receive $23 million guaranteed, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been finalized. An announcement could come Friday, the person said.</p>
      <p>NFL Network was first to report the agreement.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Tretter has been a steady presence up front for the Browns, who signed him as a free agent in 2017. He started all 16 games last season and played every snap despite a severely sprained ankle.</p>
      <p>Cleveland’s offensive line did not allow a sack in five of the team’s final seven games in 2018.</p>

      <p>Tretter was drafted by Green Bay in the fourth round in 2013 out of Cornell. He played three seasons with the Packers, making 10 starts.</p>
