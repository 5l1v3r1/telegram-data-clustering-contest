Mexico prison raid leads to chaos in border city

07 Nov 2019

MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican security forces continue working inside a state prison in an operation that set off a night of chaos in Ciudad Juarez.
State prosecutor Jorge Nava says eight people were murdered in various incidents Tuesday night as some 850 local, state and federal officers raided the prison.
Four arrested suspects told authorities they were paid in methamphetamine to create a distraction. They burned five private vehicles and 10 buses, including one transporting assembly plant workers. Several workers suffered burns.
Nava said Wednesday it was a “Machiavellian plan to be able to get authorities to stop the operation.”
He did not provide details about the murders.



It was reminiscent of Oct. 17 shootouts in Culiacan that resulted in the release of a son of jailed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
