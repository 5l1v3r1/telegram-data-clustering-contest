Ingenious T-Shirt Design Makes You Invisible To AI’s Intrusive Eyes
07 Nov 2019 by Mikelle Leow
There are several options claiming to help you bypass surveillance and AI sensors, and most of them look ridiculous. In time, though, you might be able to evade detection by wearing a simple t-shirt. Researchers from Northeastern University, MIT, and IBM have created an innovative t-shirt that conceals you from image recognition systems. Like CAPTCHA, the garment fools bots into thinking the object is something else or that there’s nobody there. The Adversarial T-Shirt features a special design that, when printed on a garment, makes the wearer indiscernible to AI detectors. Advertisement Advertisement Unlike previous options, the t-shirt looks pretty natural, and works even when the top is wrinkled or deformed. However, it’s still a work in progress. The researchers divulge that it currently has a 79-percent digital and 63-percent physical success rate.
