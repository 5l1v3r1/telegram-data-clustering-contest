      <p>Following months of secrecy from producer M. Night Shyamalan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1cOR0sRRIw">Apple TV+'s <i>Servant</i> trailer teases creepy new plot details</a>. The Wednesday, Nov. 6 preview of the upcoming psychological thriller series reveals Philadelphia couple Sean and Dorothy Turner (Toby Kebbell and Lauren Ambrose) are grieving the loss of their 13-month-old son, Jericho. For Dorothy, whom Sean explains "took it hard," her grief therapy involved replacing her late child with a lifelike doll, which, he adds was "the only thing that brought her back."</p>
      <p>The ten-episode series, which <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/everything-you-need-to-know-about-apple-tv-subscription-18806431">Apple TV+ will make available to stream</a> on Thanksgiving, Nov. 28, will also deliver another twist in the form of the titular "servant," or more like "a nanny for a doll," Leanne <i>(Game of Thrones’ </i>Nell Tiger Free). For some as-yet-unknown reason, the caretaker seems to be even more committed (almost unsettlingly so) to the charade than the father himself. In its official description, Apple TV+ cited a "rift" in the mourning couple's marriage as opening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1cOR0sRRIw">opening "the door for a mysterious force</a> to enter their home," so perhaps there's much more to Leanne than initially meets the eye.</p>
      <p>Twice during the sneak peek clip, a voice is heard asking, "Do you know who you welcomed into your home?" The mystery of Leanne's identity will surely be central to the new series' suspense. Rounding out the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/178664-what-is-rupert-grint-doing-now-harry-potters-ron-weasley-is-prepping-to-re-enter-the-spotlight"><i>Servant</i> cast is <i>Harry Potter</i>'s Rupert Grint</a> as Dorothy’s brother Julian Pierce, who adds to the intrigue of what could potentially is transpiring in this Philadelphia house.</p>

      <p>Prior to Nov. 6, the only publicly available <i>Servant</i> footage came in the form of two brief late Sept. <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/24/m-night-shymalan-servant-apple-tv-series-teasers/">teasers, one featuring the then-unknown "creepy-looking" baby</a> watching TV. In the other, a cricket crawls out of a bathtub drain, and viewers hear a woman say, "My aunt used to say that when a cricket came into your home, something bad was coming." <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-glass-twist-ending-might-be-m-night-shyamalans-most-ambitious-one-yet-15730495">Shyamalan reportedly first privately unveiled</a> the <i>Servant</i> trailer during an Oct. 3 New York Comic Con panel.</p>
      <p>"Ok. I've been very quiet about what I have been working on with Apple TV+ but it has been one of the most incredible creative experiences," <a href="https://twitter.com/mnightshyamalan/status/1176483174861303809">Shyamalan tweeted on Sept. 24, along with a <i>Servant</i> teaser</a>. He added that he was "so excited" to tell fans all about the new show at Comic Con.</p>

      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/m-night-shyamalan-apple-tv-series/"><i>Servant</i> marks Shyamalan's return to television</a> following his Fox mystery series <i>Wayward Pines, </i>which ran for two seasons from 2015 to 2016. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/should-you-watch-unbreakable-before-glass-the-new-m-night-shyamalan-thriller-is-meant-to-stand-alone-15582915">Shyamalan also recently directed 2019's <i>Glass</i></a>, which served as a crossover for characters from his <i>Split</i> and <i>Unbreakable</i> films. His is among the freshman roster of programming for Apple TV+, with the new subscription streaming service having launched on Nov. 1. Among other original Apple TV+ tites: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-the-morning-show-uses-a-metoo-scandal-to-discuss-its-aftermath-19287749">Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon's <i>The Morning Show</i></a> and <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/wiz-khalifas-dickinson-character-is-emily-dickinsons-greatest-muse-19288336"><i>Dickinson</i>, which stars Hailee Steinfeld and Wiz Khalifa</a>.</p>
      <p>If the newly released <i>Servant</i> trailer is any indication, the Apple TV+ series will surely have the attention of fans of a solid, creepy psychological twist. The image of fake baby Jericho is surely enough to stick in one's mind, at the very least.</p>
