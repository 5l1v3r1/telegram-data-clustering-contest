      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A new report says Federal Aviation Administration errors contributed to the crash of a floatplane in Alaska.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported Thursday that the National Transportation Safety Board report criticizes FAA oversight of the company operating the July 2018 flight.</p>
      <p>There were no deaths when the de Havilland Otter owned by Taquan Air crashed into Mount Bradley in Juneau.</p>
      <p>Six passengers were seriously hurt and four sustained minor injuries on the flight originating at Prince of Wales Island.</p>
      <p>The report says the FAA allowed Taquan to keep an operations director who was at times too busy to oversee flight safety due to another aviation job.</p>

      <p>An FAA spokesman said Thursday that the agency could not immediately respond to questions about the report it had just received.</p>
