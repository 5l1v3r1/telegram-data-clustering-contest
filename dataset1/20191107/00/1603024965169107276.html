      <p>The brokerage believes these stocks will be chosen on the higher free float market cap criteria.</p>
      <p>Insurance stocks have been the biggest gainers in the last one year with ICICI Prudential rising 45 percent and SBI Life up 68 percent. Most experts believe these stocks are expected to be in demand due to low penetration of life insurance sector in India compared to developed countries.</p>
      <p>On the other side, ICICI Direct believes due to the lower free float market cap, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-housing/indiabullshousingfinance/IHF01">Indiabulls Housing Finance</a>, and <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pharmaceuticals/glenmarkpharma/GP08">Glenmark Pharma</a> may be excluded from the MSCI India index.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
