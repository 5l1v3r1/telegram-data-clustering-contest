Amazon's big Black Friday sales on its hardware kick off November 22

07 Nov 2019, 00:24

November is already here, which means that Black Friday will be here before we even know it. There are already a ton of deals to be had, including a bunch of 'Happy HoliDeals' offers that are running right now, but Amazon has just taken the wraps off of some upcoming plans. Amazon sells tons of its own first-party hardware, and now we finally know when we can expect to see it going on sale, as well as how much it will selling for.
