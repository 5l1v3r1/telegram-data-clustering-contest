      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Officials with Tennessee’s Medicaid program want to expand postpartum health insurance for low-income women.</p>
      <p>The Tennessean reports TennCare Deputy Director Stephen Smith announced at a Wednesday state budget hearing that the program hopes to expand the program current two-month coverage to an entire year.</p>
      <p>Smith says the move was inspired by 52 Tennessee women who died in 2017 within a year of giving birth. He says many of the women suffered opioid additions and, with the risk of relapse heightened postpartum, most died from overdoses after their TennCare coverage ended.</p>
      <p>TennCare estimates that up to 6,500 women currently not eligible for state insurance could be covered by the extended program. TennCare’s budget presentation proposes a three-year pilot of the expansion, which it says may cost about $19.5 million annually.</p>
