      <p>“Matsekete was part of the team that set up Old Mutual Asset Managers, now OMIG, in Zimbabwe soon after demutualisation 20 years ago, so I am very pleased to be welcoming him back into the Old Mutual family,” Chinaka added.</p>
      <p>Matsekete’s appointment comes at a time when the group has been conducting a rigorous internal and external recruitment process.</p>
      <p>“This new appointment does come at a challenging time in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>However, it is thanks to the strength of our leadership that we have weathered the storm and will continue to seize opportunities for growth. Matseketse can now build on the strong foundation we have in Zimbabwe to take the business forward,” Chinaka said.</p>
