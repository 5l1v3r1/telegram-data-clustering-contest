      <p>One night after Kentucky freshman guard Tyrese Maxey stole the national headlines in his team’s win over No. 1 Michigan State, Cole Anthony made his own mark on college basketball.</p>
      <p>With his father, former NBA point guard and current NBA analyst Greg Anthony in the building, the 6-foot-3 Anthony set North Carolina and ACC records by putting up 34 points, 11 rebounds and 5 assists in North Carolina’s 76-65 win over rival Notre Dame. Anthony, a New York City native who spent last season at famed Oak Hill Academy (VA), drained six 3-pointers in his debut.</p>
      <p>Anthony’s scoring output was the highest ever by a North Carolina freshman in a debut. To put that in perspective, that means Anthony scored more in his debut than James Worthy, Michael Jordan, Vince Carter, Tyler Hansbrough or anyone else in program history.</p>
      <p>He also tied for the third-most points by a freshman in North Carolina history, and became the first ACC freshman with 30, 10 and 5 in a debut in the last 20 seasons.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, I used to say, Tyler Hansbrough carried us," UNC coach Roy Williams told reporters. “Cole Anthony carried us tonight. ... That was pretty impressive, to say the least."</p>
      <p>Anthony, <a href="https://www.zagsblog.com/2019/11/04/cole-anthony-cassius-winston-james-wiseman-headline-naismith-watch-list/">who was named to the Naismith Watch List</a>, began the game wearing goggles but then took them off because he said they impacted his depth perception.</p>
      <p>"It's cool, I'm going to — not celebrate, but be happy about it a little bit tonight, give myself a little pat on the back," <a href="https://goheels.com/news/2019/11/6/mens-basketball-basketball-vs-notre-dame.aspx?path=mbball">Anthony told reporters</a>. "But we've got practice tomorrow. We've got to lock back in. We've got a game on Friday."</p>
      <p>Notre Dame coach Mike Brey is familiar with Anthony, having recruited him heavily before Anthony<a href="https://www.zagsblog.com/2019/04/23/cole-anthony-to-north-carolina/"> chose North Carolina in April over Oregon, Georgetown and Notre Dame</a>.</p>
      <p>He effectively replaced Coby White, who is now a rookie with the Chicago Bulls.</p>
      <p>“Cole is the consummate point guard for today's game," legendary Oak Hill coach Steve Smith said when Anthony committed. "He is a scoring point guard. He thrives in transition with tremendous court vision and awareness. He can play equally as well in the half court. He defends his position and I have never coached a point guard that rebounds the ball the way he does. How many point guards average as many rebounds as they do assists? Cole does!"</p>
      <p>Now Anthony is a projected top-5 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft and already point guard-starved teams like the Knicks are dreaming of “getting in a hole to land Cole.” The Knicks dropped to 1-7 after Wednesday’s loss in Detroit.</p>
