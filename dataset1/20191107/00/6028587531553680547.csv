Topline: Collins English dictionary has named “climate strike” its word of 2019, continuing a trend of recognizing environmentally-linked phrases after “single-use” was chosen last year.

“Climate strike,” defined as “a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change,” was first registered by Collins in 2015, to coincide with the Climate Change conference in Paris, where a mass protest took place.
Lexicographers at the dictionary and educational publisher spotted use of the word had grown more than any other word on their radar. They logged a 100-fold increase in the use of the word this year and a fourfold increase since 2013.
Words that were shortlisted include: BoPo (short for body positivity), rewilding (returning areas of land to a wild state) influencer, non-binary (a gender identity that does not conform to male or female categories) and deepfake (a doctored image or video that looks unedited).
In recent years, fake news (2017), Brexit (2016), and binge-watch (2015) have been crowned word of the year by Collins.

Crucial quote: “These are strange, anxiety-inducing times—but there are reasons to be cheerful. That’s what the English language seems to be telling us in 2019. Having trawled websites, newspapers, magazines, social media, and everyday conversations, Collins’ lexicographers have detected an uptick in words linked to both environmental and digital derangement—as well as ones linked to fighting back,” Collins said in a statement.
Key background: Usage of the word “climate strike” exploded in the last year partially thanks to protests around the world inspired by Swedish student and climate activist Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion campaign group.
