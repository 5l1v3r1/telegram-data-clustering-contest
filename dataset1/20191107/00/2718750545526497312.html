      <h1>James Holzhauer Gets Senioritis, Only Wins $30,000 in His <i>Jeopardy!</i> Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:30:29+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Ivie</a></address>
      <p>The prodigal buzzer returns! <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/jeopardy-emma-boettcher-james-holzhauer-defeat-interview.html">Months after ending his reign</a> as one of <i>Jeopardy!</i>’s <a href="http://www.vulture.com/article/jeopardy-quiz-james-holzhauer-got-wrong.html">most successful players</a> of all time, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/04/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-winning-strategy.html">James Holzhauer</a> appeared on the show Wednesday evening to compete in the biennial Tournament of Champions. Surprise, surprise: He won quite formidably, defeating his smart opponents, Lindsey Shultz and Alan Dunn, in what was by all means a runaway game. However, take a look at that score. $30,635? In <i>this </i>game-show economy? It’s far from Holzhauer’s best work, and, in fact, it’s actually his second worst single-game tally ever. (The lowest amount of money he won comes from his sixth game back in April, when he <i>only</i> took in $27,190.) With the quarterfinals behind him, Holzhauer will now advance to the tournament’s semifinal round, and he’ll compete in a trio of games this upcoming Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Should Holzhauer win the tournament, $250,000 will be deposited into his savings account.</p>
      <p>To recap Holzhauer’s previous <i>Jeopardy! </i>success, he captivated the nation earlier this year with his “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-winning-strategy.html">strategically aggressive</a>” gameplay, which he defined as seeking high-value clues first and subsequently wagering a significant amount — if not his entire sum — of money on Daily Doubles. (This made it virtually impossible for his competitors to catch up.) He ended his reign with an astounding total sum <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/james-holzhauer-ken-jennings-jeopardy-record.html">of $2,464,216 over 32 games</a>, which places him in second place for a player’s total regular-game earnings, as well as second for consecutive games won. (Ken Jennings, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/ken-jennings-alex-trebek-jeopardy-all-star-games.html">the GOAT</a>, still remains first in both.) The woman who defeated him, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/jeopardy-emma-boettcher-james-holzhauer-defeat-interview.html">Emma Boettcher</a>, will be making her tournament debut on Thursday. Give us the rematch already!</p>
