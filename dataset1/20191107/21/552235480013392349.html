      <h1>EK residents could be forced to pay for parking outside their own home</h1>
      <h2>The recommendations will now be put to the community and enterprise resources committee on November 12 for final approval</h2>

      <p>Plans to charge residents for parking outside their own homes have moved a step closer.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council’s roads safety forum have endorsed recommendations to introduce a £10 charge to issue permits in Residents’ Parking Permit Zones (RPPZs).</p>
      <p>The recommendations will now be put to the community and enterprise resources committee on November 12 for final approval.</p>
      <p>Engineering manager Colin Park put forward the research into the RPPZ policy to the roads safety forum last Wednesday.</p>

      <p>He said: “The view of the forum was that RPPZs were an effective demand management approach to assist in minimising the impact on residents in areas of competing parking demand.</p>
      <p>“RPPZs should be seen as an additional approach that officers can use to complement existing approaches.”</p>
      <p>Councillors previously agreed to the principal of charging in order to cover the cost of issuing permits and council officers have recommended option one – a flat £10 per permit scheme.</p>
      <p>Currently, up to four permits are issued per household in each RPPZ with around 6900 issued to residents and businesses at a cost of almost £50,000.</p>

      <p>After the council’s recent climate change declaration, Rutherglen Central and North councillor Janine Calikes was concerned that allowing four permits per household could send the wrong message.</p>
      <p>She said the council was “not addressing the issue” and that people may have to “justify if they need more than two”.</p>
      <p>Mr Park said that residents “took advantage” of the current system and that each household “didn’t have four cars each”.</p>
      <p>He also suggested future schemes could see free permits issued for electric or hybrid vehicles, and a sliding scale could be used for diesel and petrol cars.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that a charge could reduce the number of permits issued by one third.</p>
      <p>The forum had also previously enquired about using the surplus from a permit charge to cover the cost of additional parking attendants however a £10 charge would only generate £50,000 and more expensive options may not be accepted as “reasonable” by residents.</p>
