蔡英文選情飆漲 專家：北京是最佳助選員

07 Nov 2019, 21:28

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月08日訊】對中共而言，2020年中華民國大選無疑很重要。但是北京近來對港台一系列的施壓動作，反而令蔡英文原本低落的民調起死回生並不斷高漲，中共支持的候選人眼看獲勝無望。專家指，北京儼然成為蔡英文的「最佳助選員」。
11月5日《彭博社》發表評論文章稱，中共「正在破壞它自己的台灣政策」。此文作者為澳大利亞洛伊研究所研究員、前《金融時報》駐北京記者站主任馬利德(Richard McGregor)。
文章說，中共希望自己喜歡的候選人贏得明年1月的中華民國大選，但奇怪的是，北京正在做很多事情破壞韓國瑜勝出的機會。過去一年來，北京一手復蘇了其政治對手、民進黨蔡英文總統的勝選前景。
文章提到，今年年初蔡英文民調只有24%的支持度，但是北京當局發表以「一國兩制」推動統一的講話，再加上對台灣更嚴厲的打壓，導致強硬反共的蔡英文目前在多個民調中的支持率都超過53%，而國民黨候選人韓國瑜只有31%。中共強硬打壓香港反送中抗議，令蔡英文的聲勢繼續高漲。
文章認為，北京的策略取得適得其反的效果後，依然無意修正自己的立場，顯示在北京當局的強硬政治路線壓制下，相對柔軟的政治姿態已難以持續。而這種這種不妥協的做法，將導致未來發生誤判的風險增加。
賓州大學當代中國研究中心主任戴傑（Jacque deLisle）在上週華府一次座談會上更戲稱，習近平已成為蔡英文連任的「榮譽競選陣營主席」。
戴傑表示，北京每一個行動都會引起反應，中共的強硬打壓也會為台灣帶來更多美國的支持、外來的支持以及更多國際空間，對台灣「過多的壓力」也可能對台灣內部的政治勢力分布造成反效果。
前美國在台協會主席卜睿哲(Richard Bush)也對《美國之音》表示，他以前認為，中共施壓台灣是為了懲罰民進黨政府及其選民，包括挖走中華民國邦交國，但實際上挖走台灣盟友同樣對國民黨不利。因此，現在他得出的結論是，中共已不在乎中華民國誰執政，或許「它只對展示和行使它的權力有興趣而已」。
前美國在台協會台北辦事處處長包道格(Douglas Paal)也認為，中共對中華民國2020年選舉的期望已不高，中共現在的施壓已開始針對民進黨勝選後的台灣。
中共近年來開始高調對外擴張，並積極介入國際事務，直奔所謂的「人類命運共同體」，其外交政策日趨強硬。也有台媒分析，北京當局對外政策過度強硬，或顯示中共已經被它多年培養的民間「愛國情緒」所挾持，喪失了彈性調整的空間。
另一方面，在香港反送中運動中，一家親共港媒曾痛批港首林鄭月娥給北京攪局，並宣稱「只要北京穩住了，香港和台灣不會亂」。這顯示中南海內鬥可能也是造成港台亂局的一個重要因素。
香港歷來是中共江派大佬曾慶紅的地盤，江派多年來都在攪亂香港，給習近平挖坑。而中共外交系統，包括國台辦也由江派掌控多年，目前習近平當局仍在持續整肅外交部門。此前台灣一度出現兩個被指中共背景的總統候選人，並相互攻擊。有分析指，兩人的後台或分屬中共不同派系。
近日網傳一段中共高官的私下談話錄音指，中共統治面臨危機，內部三股勢力也在你死我活地激鬥，早已顧不上人民的死活。

Cai English's election is soaring. Expert: Beijing is the best assistant.

07 Nov 2019, 21:28

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 08, 2019] For the Chinese Communist Party, the 2020 Republic of China general election is undoubtedly very important. However, Beijing’s recent pressure on Hong Kong and Taiwan has caused the original low-profile polls of Tsai Ing-hui to rise and rise, and the candidates supported by the CCP are hopeless to win. Experts say that Beijing has become the ""best assistant"" in Tsai Ing-wen.
On November 5th, Bloomberg published a commentary saying that the CCP ""is destroying its own Taiwan policy."" The author of this article is Richard McGregor, a researcher at the Australian Loy Institute and former director of the Financial Times' Beijing correspondent.
The article said that the CCP hopes that its favorite candidates will win the Republic of China election in January next year, but the strange thing is that Beijing is doing a lot of things to undermine the opportunity of South Korea's Yu. In the past year, Beijing has revived its political opponents and the DPP’s prospects for victory in the election of President Tsai Ing-wen.
The article mentioned that at the beginning of this year, Tsai Ing-wen polls only had 24% support, but the Beijing authorities issued a speech on ""one country, two systems"" to promote reunification, coupled with a more severe suppression of Taiwan, resulting in a tough anti-communist Tsai Ing-wen is currently in multiple The support rate in the polls is over 53%, while the Kuomintang candidate South Korea Yu is only 31%. The CCP’s hard-line suppression of Hong Kong’s anti-delivery protests has made Tsai’s English momentum continue to rise.
The article believes that after Beijing’s strategy has achieved counterproductive effects, it still has no intention of revising its position. It shows that under the suppression of the tough political line of the Beijing authorities, the relatively soft political stance is difficult to sustain. This uncompromising approach will lead to an increased risk of misjudgment in the future.
Jacque de Lisle, director of the Center for Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, even joked at a symposium in Washington last week that Xi Jinping has become the ""honor of the honorary campaign camp"" for Tsai Ing-wen.
Dai Jie said that every action in Beijing will cause a reaction. The CCP’s tough pressure will bring more US support, foreign support and more international space to Taiwan. The “excessive pressure on Taiwan” may also be internal to Taiwan. The distribution of political power has produced counter-effects.
Former US President of Taiwan Association Richard Bush also told The Voice of America that he used to think that the CCP pressured Taiwan to punish the DPP government and its constituents, including the exhumation of the Republic of China, but in fact It is also unfavorable for the Kuomintang to dig away Taiwan’s allies. Therefore, he now concludes that the CCP does not care about who is in power in the Republic of China, perhaps ""it is only interested in the power to display and exercise it.""
Douglas Paal, former director of the Taipei Office of the Taiwan Association of Taiwan, also believes that the CCP’s expectations for the 2020 elections in the Republic of China are not high, and the CCP’s current pressure has begun to target Taiwan after the Democratic Progressive Party’s victory.
In recent years, the CCP has begun to make high-profile external expansion, and has actively intervened in international affairs and went straight to the so-called ""community of human destiny"". Its foreign policy has become increasingly tough. There is also a media analysis. The Beijing authorities have been overly tough on foreign policy, or it has shown that the CCP has been held hostage by the civilian ""patriotic sentiments"" it has cultivated for many years, and has lost the space for flexible adjustment.
On the other hand, in the Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign, a pro-Hong Kong media had painstakingly approved Hong Kong's first forest Zheng Yuejun to spoil the Beijing, and declared that ""as long as Beijing stabilizes, Hong Kong and Taiwan will not be chaotic."" This shows that Zhongnanhai internal fighting may also be an important factor causing the chaos in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Hong Kong has always been the site of the Chinese Communist Party's Jiangpai Da Zeng Qinghong. The Jiang faction has been harassing Hong Kong for many years and has been digging for Xi Jinping. The Chinese diplomatic system, including the Taiwan Affairs Office, has also been under the control of the Jiang faction for many years. At present, the Xi Jinping authorities are still continuing to clean up the diplomatic service. Prior to this, Taiwan had two presidential candidates who were accused of the CCP’s background and attacked each other. Some analysts pointed out that the background of the two people or the different factions of the CCP.
Recently, a private interview with a senior official of the Chinese Communist Party reported that the CCP’s rule was facing a crisis, and the three internal forces were also fighting and dying, and they had long been unable to attend the people’s lives.
