        <b>Homes belonging to two brothers wanted for questioning about the deaths of 39 people in a lorry in Essex have been searched by the Irish authorities.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ronan and Christopher Hughes have links to Armagh in Northern Ireland and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>Two County Monaghan homes owned by the pair were among 10 properties searched by Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), according to police sources.</p>
      <p>CAB seized vehicles and cash as part of its year-long smuggling investigation.</p>
      <p>The bureau also secured court orders to freeze 20 bank accounts holding about €200,000 in total.</p>
      <p>The CAB investigation is focused on "a group suspected of being involved in various international smuggling activities".</p>
      <p>However, that investigation has "intensified over the past two weeks" according to a statement issued by gardaí (Irish police).</p>

      <p>The statement, issued on Thursday morning, said the CAB investigation was "not linked to the ongoing Essex Police investigation".</p>
      <p>However, it is understood that the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex on 23 October has given added impetus to CAB's long-running investigation into international smuggling.</p>
      <p>The 10 County Monaghan properties searched by CAB staff on Thursday consisted of seven homes and three industrial premises, which were described by gardaí as sheds or yards.</p>
      <p>The items seized during the raids included two BMW cars; a Volkswagen van and a Mitsubishi Shogun.</p>

      <p>Cash in different currencies was also found, with CAB seizing €1,400, $900 and £600.</p>
      <p>In addition to the four vehicles seized in Monaghan on Thursday, a Northern Ireland-registered lorry and a Bulgarian-registered lorry were seized at Dublin Port last Tuesday as part of the same investigation.</p>
      <p>Garda sources also confirmed that some of the material seized belongs to 40-year-old Ronan Hughes and his 34-year-old brother Christopher.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50221753">Hughes brothers were identified as suspects in the lorry deaths investigation</a> by Essex Police at the end of last month.</p>
      <p>Investigating officers said at the time the pair were wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of the 39 Vietnamese victims.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, the force said <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50333559">all 39 people have been formally identified</a> but their names are not yet being released.</p>
