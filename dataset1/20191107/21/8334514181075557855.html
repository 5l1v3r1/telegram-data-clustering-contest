      <p>(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ATVI.O">ATVI.O</a>) forecast fourth-quarter adjusted revenue below estimates, as the video game publisher faces stiff competition from online, free-to-play games.</p>

      <p>The company expects current-quarter adjusted revenue of $2.65 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $2.75 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The company had previously labeled 2019 a “transition year”, cutting about 800 jobs and focusing on investing more in developing its game franchises like “Candy Crush” and “Overwatch” to boost its top and bottom line.</p>
      <p>Traditional publishers of console-based, desktop games are facing stiff competition from the increasing popularity of online, free-to-play games like “PUBG”, Epic Games’s “Fortnite” and Electronic Arts’ (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/EA.O">EA.O</a>) “Apex Legends”.</p>
      <p>The forecast overshadows a better-than-expected third quarter adjusted revenue, which was lifted by its recent launches “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare” and “Call of Duty: Mobile”.</p>
      <p>The mobile version of “Call of Duty” launched on Oct. 1 racked up 100 million downloads worldwide in its first week, according to industry site Sensor Tower.</p>
      <p>Activision, behind popular franchises such as “Diablo” and “World of Warcraft”, reported adjusted revenue of $1.21 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.17 billion.</p>
      <p>The company, which continues its e-sports push, is set to launch its “Call of Duty League” on Jan. 24 2020, following its highly successful “Overwatch” league.</p>
      <p>The company’s net income fell to $204 million, or 26 cents per share, in the quarter, from $260 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company earned 0.38 cents per share.</p>
