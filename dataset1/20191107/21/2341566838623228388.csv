（中央社台北7日電）港媒報導，香港大學二年級陸生陳子謀7月在「反送中」示威衝突現場被捕，他假扮記者並被搜出一支伸縮棍。由於沒有證據顯示陳子謀參與暴動，西九龍裁判法院今天判決他監禁6週。
綜合星島日報、獨立媒體報導，7月28日中上環反送中示威爆發嚴重衝突，共49人被捕，其中包括24歲的陳子謀；他當時身穿記者的黃色反光背心，並被搜出一支伸縮棍。
陳子謀被捕消息傳到大陸後，他遭起底是瀋陽人，其後到港大就讀音樂系主修鋼琴，並在深圳兼課教琴，曾在社群媒體發表「批評中國的激進言論」。當時遭許多愛國網友嗆聲，要他今後別回大陸。
8月27日，陳子謀在微博發表聲明否認參與暴動，並稱721元朗襲擊事件發生後，因擔心自身安危，才買伸縮棍防身。當晚因為地鐵停駛提前下車，不知有示威而步行前往該地區，還主動找警方詢問路線，並未停留在現場參與示威，不料因為伸縮棍涉及違規被拘留。
10月24日首度開庭，陳子謀承認一項管有攻擊性武器罪；由於他不太會說廣東話，還一度要求翻譯。
案情顯示，陳子謀當時向警員解釋，由於擔心被其他人打，該伸縮棍是用來作自我防衛用途，警方於是在晚上9時20分正式拘捕他。到達警署後，陳在錄取口供表示，由於擔心被其他人襲擊，所以打扮成記者，認為這樣的外表比較安全。
據報導，主任裁判官羅德泉今天考慮到陳子謀管有的伸縮棍是用作自衛，從未展示或使用，也無任何證據證明陳是參與暴動之一員，因此判他即時監禁6星期，不得緩刑。（編輯：楊昇儒）1081107
