      <h3>The 2020 Honda Rebel received few minor cosmetic updates and is powered by an updated Euro-V compliant 471 cc parallel-twin PGM-FI engine</h3>
      <p>Honda has showcased the 2020 Rebel 500 cruiser at EICMA 2019 in Milan, Italy. The 2020 Edition of the cruiser has received minor cosmetic updates and some new features. The cruiser is available with three new colour options- Matte Armored Silver, Graphite Black and Matte Blue Jeans Metallic.</p>
      <p>The first thing that will catch everyone’s attention is the new round LED headlamp that replaced the stock halogen unit of its predecessor. The cruiser also features a new LED taillight at the rear and LED side turn indicators.</p>
      <p>The Rebel 500 Bobber styling is further reflected by its raked 11.2-liter fuel tank and a flat handlebar. The cruiser features an updated round compact LCD unit with negative display that features a new gear position indicator and fuel consumption display while the ignition positioned below the left side of fuel tank adds an old school feeling.</p>
