      <p>PHILADELPHIA (CN) — A former Division 1 football player who went on to play for the Steelers and the Broncos brought a <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/johnson-edpa.pdf">federal class action</a> to force fair compensation for student-athletes.</p>
      <p>Represented by Philadelphia-based Paul McDonald and Wigdor in Manhattan, lead plaintiff Ralph “Trey” Johnson filed the 116-page doorstopper against the National Collegiate Athletic Association and 22 Pennsylvania colleges and universities.</p>
      <p>At its outset the complaint confronts the NCAA with its own analogy that likens student-athletes to “prisoners, who may be required to work without pay because the Thirteenth Amendment permits involuntary servitude as punishment for crime.”</p>
      <p>“While the NCAA may wish to treat student-athletes as <i>prisoners, there is no legal basis for the decision to do so</i>,” the complaint states (emphasis in original).</p>
      <p>Johnson, who used to play for Villanova, likens student-athletes to the students accepted into work-study programs. Both are supervised by adults responsible for filling out time sheets, albeit those supervising the athletes are well-paid members of “the billion-dollar Big Business of NCAA sports,” according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>Students who take tickets or work the concession stands at an NCAA game earn about $11 an hour through work-study. “At the same time, the student-athletes, whose athletic work creates <i>those </i>work-study jobs at the ticket gate, in the seats and at the concession stands, are paid <i>nothing</i>,” the complaint continues.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s complaint comes after an October <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ncaa-clears-way-for-college-athletes-to-make-money-from-deals/">announcement</a> by the NCAA that it is contemplating allowing D-I, -II and -III student-athletes to profit of their name, image and likeness — a new scheme expected to take effect by January 2021. </p>
      <p>In the past, similar cases have not fared well in court. In 2018, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit in which former Villanova University football player Lawrence “Poppy” Livers said he should have been paid for his time as a student-athlete. In another suit by former University of Southern California linebacker Lamar Dawson, the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-no-minimum-wage-for-college-football-players/">ruled</a> this past August that college football players are not NCAA employees entitled to minimum wage.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the NCAA did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. McDonald did not immediately return a phone call or an email seeking comment. Johnson plays today in the Canadian Football League.</p>
