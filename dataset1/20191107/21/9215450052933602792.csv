輝立暗盤價：收報1.13元，升18.56%。

小心新股首日表現大波動
宏滙資產管理董事及投資策略總監林嘉麒指出，這批上市的新股多數為市值少於10億元的細價股，相信首日上市可能有一成至兩成升幅，但要小心最近新股上市當日都有獲利離場情況。
而新股大多以下限定價，相信短期可以上市上限價作目標，當中可以多留意最近熱炒的藥業股，而東曜藥業（01875）暫時仍處於虧損狀態，短線可望炒上至7.8元至8元水平，但長遠仍需公司開始獲利，股價才能進一步向上。

[New stock strategy] Xinji Shaxi price rose 40%! 6 listed new shares on the same day
07 Nov 2019, 21:39 by Investment
The IPO market of the new shares continued to be lively. Although a large number of new shares were listed immediately after the listing, many retail investors lost their hands. However, after a medium-handed tour (00302) had a stamina, the atmosphere of the new stocks became hot again. On Friday (November 8th), there will be 6 new shares listed, among which the performance of the dark disk is different. The economy will cover the performance of each new stock in the week, and then ask the experts to teach the road and decide to open the market after Friday!

Hong Kong façade engineering company Yimei International (01870) was oversubscribed by more than 19 times and the price was limited to 0.97 yuan. The company's turnover and gross profit last year rose 10% and 4.8% respectively.

Beware of the big fluctuations in the first day of new shares
Lin Jiawei, director of Honghui Asset Management and director of investment strategy, pointed out that most of the listed new shares are low-priced stocks with a market capitalization of less than 1 billion yuan. I believe that the first day of listing may increase from 10% to 20%, but beware of the recent IPO listings. There are profitable departures.
Most of the new shares are below the price limit. I believe that the short-term price can be listed as the target price. Among them, we can pay more attention to the recent hot-selling pharmaceutical stocks, while Dongpu Pharmaceutical (01875) is still in a loss state for the time being, and it is expected to be up to 7.8 yuan in the short-term. To the level of 8 yuan, but the long-term still needs the company to start to profit, the stock price can be further upward.
