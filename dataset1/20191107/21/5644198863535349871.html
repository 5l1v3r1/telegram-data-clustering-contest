      <p>SINGAPORE: Two teenagers have been arrested in separate cases of payment card fraud involving a ride-hailing firm and a taxi company, police said on Thursday (Nov 7). </p>

      <p>Following investigations, it was revealed that a 17-year-old boy had created these accounts with the taxi company, and used debit cards with insufficient funds to book rides. </p>
      <p>He was arrested on Wednesday. A mobile phone and four bank cards were seized. </p>
      <p>In the second case, police received information that another 17-year-old had defrauded a ride-hailing firm. </p>
      <p>Preliminary investigations revealed he had created several user accounts with the company using prepaid cards with insufficient funds to book rides. </p>
      <p>He was arrested on Thursday, and a mobile phone and two bank cards were seized. </p>
      <p>“In both cases, the teenagers are believed to have made bookings on behalf of other passengers and charged these passengers at cheaper than market rates,” police said.</p>
      <p>“They then requested for them to make payments for the rides amounting to more than US$1,000 for the first case and more than US$1,100 in the second case, directly to their bank accounts.”</p>
      <p>Investigations are ongoing. </p>
      <p>Those convicted of unauthorised access to computer materials could be fined up to S$5,000, jailed up to two years or both.</p>
