      <h1>Sinitta claims she pitched X Factor replacement to ITV before Simon Cowell</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The former girlfriend of Simon Cowell says she dreamed up a talent show idea last year</h2>

      <p>While Simon Cowell and Little Mix battle over who’s idea it was to form a band for a new show - Sinitta says in fact she actually came up with the format first.</p>
      <p>She says she’s been working on a show for 18 months long before either the girl group’s The Search or Simons’ The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : The Band was planned.</p>
      <p>In the footage from the pilot, which was filmed in November 2018, she explains: “Little Mix are all grown up and there isn’t a new girlband that’s killing it so we are going to make one.”</p>
      <p>She claims she pitched the show to Simon Cowell as well as Syco MD Tyler Brown.</p>

      <p>She continued: “We created our show late summer 2018. I showed the orginal idea to Tyler at Syco music then a little bit to Simon.”</p>
      <p>Simon even features in some of the clips giving advice to some of the singers telling them “there is no guarantees” in the music industry.</p>

      <p>There’s no guarantees your mate won’t take your idea either Simon!</p>
      <p>But Sinitta has no hard feelings that her pal has gone with a similar format.</p>

      <p>A well placed source explained: “Sinitta pitched the show to Simon last year. She’s already has her series edited. She’s been snapped up by a TV agent and has been meeting with networks. This was long before either Simon or Little Mix announced their shows.”</p>
