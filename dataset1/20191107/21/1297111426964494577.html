      <p>The City of Regina is warning residents about the hazards of thin ice after firefighters were sent to rescue a local resident in the city’s north end.</p>
      <p>Regina Fire and Protective Services rescued someone Wednesday night who had fallen through thin ice on a lake. “Although the weather has taken a frigid cold turn, the ice that has formed on Regina’s water surfaces is still very thin,” states the city’s news release.</p>
      <p>Residents are reminded to stay away from all bodies of water, including Wascana Lake and creek, storm channels and detention ponds in residential neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>The city advises that throughout the winter season, do not walk, ski, skate or play on any body of water. It also urged parents and guardians are asked to take a few moments to talk with children about safety rules.</p>
      <p>It is also suggested dogs are kept on leashes when close to bodies of water. If a pet breaks through the ice, people are advised against attempting a rescue since that can put the rescuer at risk.</p>
      <p>Those who see anyone, particularly children, close to thin ice, is asked to call the Regina Police Service at 306-777-6500.</p>
      <p>In an emergency involving people or pets, call 9-1-1.</p>
