In Hindsight... Infamous Tech Industry Predictions and Quotations
07 Nov 2019, 21:52 by Graham Singer and Julio Franco
The computing industry is fuelled by prediction and gossip. Before the patent became the carefully guarded weapon it is today, chip engineers from competing companies would often share an astounding amount of information on an informal basis -- not just with each other, but with the wider consumer audience as well.
As an accelerated timeline of novel products, new features and standards gained momentum, the sound bite and quotable quote became the means to become noticed by a user base clamouring for any tidbit in the thousands of tech-centric forums and the endless stream of industry related magazines.
Three years before co-founding Intel and whilst working as Fairchild Semiconductors head of R&D, Gordon E. Moore authored an article “Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits” which appeared in the April 19, 1965 edition of Electronics Magazine. In that paper Moore predicted that the transistor count for a minimum component cost would double every year for at least a decade based upon Fairchild’s previous five years of IC design. So accurate a forecast -- and self-fulfilling prophecy -- Moore and Intel became prime movers in the industry and his prediction is enshrined as Moore’s law.
Within an industry known as much for its predictive pronouncements and verbal sparring as its actual innovation, low bandwidth morality, and elastic attitude towards intellectual property rights, many have felt compelled to follow Gordon Moore in bringing their judgements and observations into the public eye… with varying degrees of success.
“Two years from now, spam will be solved” – Bill Gates, founder and then Microsoft's Chairman [World Economic Forum, January 2004]

I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders” – Michael Dell, Chairman/CEO of Dell Computers said when asked what he would do if he was CEO of Apple [Various news outlets, October 1997]



“The era of the PC is over” – Louis Gerstner, Chairman/CEO of IBM [Smart Computing, July 1999]“There's no doubt that the antitrust lawsuit was bad for Microsoft, and we would have been more focused on creating the phone operating system. And so instead of using Android today, you would be using Windows Mobile” – Bill Gates on why he thinks Microsoft was unable to build the world's most popular mobile OS... he got too personally involved with the company's antitrust battle in the late 90s [New York Times DealBook Conference – November 2019]“There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.” – Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO [USA Today, April 2007]

The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It's complete gibberish. It's insane. When is this idiocy going to stop?” – Larry Ellison, Oracle co-founder and CEO [Analyst conference, September, 2008]



– Tandy’s Radio Shack division financial VP when asked about the IBM PC“There definitely is a new kid on the block, but there is nothing that IBM has presented that would blow the industry away”[Business Week, August 24, 1981]By 1989, eight years after its introduction, the IBM PC and its clones had captured 83.6% of the personal computing market.– John Roach, Tandy President in August 1981 when asked about the impact that IBM’s imminent move into personal computing with the IBM PC“I don't think it's that significant”[The Making of Microsoft, by Daniel Ichbiah and Susan Knepper, 1991]



“Stone Age. Bronze Age. Iron Age. We define entire epics of humanity by the technology they use. In fact, technology has been the story of human progress from as long back as we know. In 100 years people will look back on now and say, “That was the Internet Age.” And computers will be seen as a mere ingredient to the Internet Age.” – Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and CEO [Education Innovation Summit, May 2002]At the COMDEX expo in Las Vegas on 18 Nov 1996, Andrew Grove (Intel CEO and President) predicts that by 2011, Intel CPUs will integrate one billion transistors, operate at 10 GHz and be capable of 100,000 MIPS (millions of instructions per second). Intel’s Gulftown would meet two of those criteria (1.17 billion transistors and 147,600 MIPS) in 2010. We are still waiting on the third.
