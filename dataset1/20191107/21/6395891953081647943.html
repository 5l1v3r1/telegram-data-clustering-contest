      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - New data shows an "alarming" rise in vaping by Rhode Island high school students, state health officials said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Department of Health said 10.2% of high school students now report frequent use of vaping products, compared to 3.7% in 2017. Frequent use means using vaping products on 20 or more days in the month prior to taking the survey.</p>
      <p>The department's 2019 youth risk behavior survey also found 30.1% of high school students reported vaping at least once in the last 30 days, compared to 20.1% in 2017. Overall, 48.9% of high school students and 16.4% of middle school students reported trying vaping in 2019.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said the numbers are a "wake-up call."</p>
      <p>"Electronic cigarettes are dangerous. They're also responsible for getting more teenagers addicted to nicotine every year, primarily because of products that come in candy-like flavors," Raimondo said in a statement. "That's why I took action this September. Nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our kids."</p>
      <p>Raimondo signed an executive order banning flavored vaping products in September, saying that a ban is necessary to protect children.</p>
      <p>A Superior Court judge denied an industry association's request Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against the ban. The Washington-based Vapor Technology Association and the owner of RI e-Cig and Vapes, Donna Dionne, didn't immediately say whether they'll continue pursuing the case.</p>
      <p>The health department is also convening an advisory committee to monitor vaping developments and recommend next steps to promote public health.</p>
