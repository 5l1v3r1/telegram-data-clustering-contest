      <h1>MLS chief claims Zlatan Ibrahimovic has "signed for AC Milan"</h1>
      <h2>Former Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is looking for a new challenge - and he could be set to rejoin AC Milan as he departs the MLS</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:35:59+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>MLS commissioner Don Graber has claimed Zlatan Ibrahimovic has signed for AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Swedish superstar Ibrahimovic departed LA Galaxy at the end of the most recent MLS campaign, ending an 18-month spell in the United States.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old has been linked with a host of clubs as he aims to extend his playing career - and Graber has claimed AC Milan will be his next destination.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, who also enjoyed a successful spell under Jose Mourinho at local rivals Inter, scored 42 Serie A goals in just two prolific seasons with AC Milan before departing for Paris Saint-Germain in 2012.</p>
      <p>He could now be set for a second spell as the club look to find more goals after a lacklustre start to the season leaving them 11th in the table.</p>

      <p>Graber told ESPN: "Zlatan is an interesting character. He keeps me very busy &amp; you need this kind of players like what happened with Beckham few years ago.</p>
      <p>"He is 38 years old &amp; has now been signed by Milan, one of the biggest clubs in the world."</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic recently teased a return to Spain, posting an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story claiming: "Hola Espana. I'm coming back".</p>
      <p>But it has been claimed the post was a publicity stunt related to him becoming a brand ambassador for betting firm Bethard.</p>
      <p>A-League side Perth Glory were also reported to have launched an ambitious bid to sign the superstar on a short term deal.</p>

      <p>But a move back to Italy has appeared most likely, with Napoli also said to be keen.</p>
      <p>He now appears to be close to a move back to the San Siro, where he has enjoyed arguably the most success in his memorable career.</p>
      <p>He seemed to confirm his MLS career was over after LA Galaxy's play-off defeat last monht.</p>
      <p>"What happens next year? I don't know," he said. "If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is."</p>
