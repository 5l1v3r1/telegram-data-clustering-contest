The City of Regina is warning residents about the hazards of thin ice after firefighters were sent to rescue a local resident in the city’s north end.
Regina Fire and Protective Services rescued someone Wednesday night who had fallen through thin ice on a lake. “Although the weather has taken a frigid cold turn, the ice that has formed on Regina’s water surfaces is still very thin,” states the city’s news release.
Residents are reminded to stay away from all bodies of water, including Wascana Lake and creek, storm channels and detention ponds in residential neighbourhoods.
The city advises that throughout the winter season, do not walk, ski, skate or play on any body of water. It also urged parents and guardians are asked to take a few moments to talk with children about safety rules.
It is also suggested dogs are kept on leashes when close to bodies of water. If a pet breaks through the ice, people are advised against attempting a rescue since that can put the rescuer at risk.
Those who see anyone, particularly children, close to thin ice, is asked to call the Regina Police Service at 306-777-6500.
In an emergency involving people or pets, call 9-1-1.
