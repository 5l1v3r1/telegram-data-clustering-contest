21 Red Hair Color Ideas for Every Complexion
07 Nov 2019, 21:51 by Janell M. Hickman
While just two percent of the world's population is born with red hair (including baby Archie according to mom, Meghan Markle), you don't need a ginger gene to pull off the super-rare shade. “The key to achieving the most natural red hair is sticking within the copper or copper-gold family,” explains Matrix celebrity stylist George Papanikolas, who works with the Kardashians, Hailey Baldwin, Shay Mitchell and Nicole Richie. “Any highlights should also stay on tone and in the warm family to accent and compliment the copper base.”
As a former temporary redhead myself, admittedly one challenge can be maintaining your new shade at home. Red dyes notorious bleed faster than other colors, making faded an annoying but real reality. Celebrity hairstylist Chuck Amos— who works with Tracee Ellis Ross, Alicia Keys, Erykah Badu, Solange, and Lion Babe—suggests opting for tinted shampoo or conditioners for colored hair . “This way, you can enhance your color during the wash process,” he explains. “Even if you're born with red tones, you usually need color boost on a regular basis.
Another sub-trend we’re predicting? Cinnamon spice hair, not to be confused with the pumpkin spice phenomena. KEVIN.MURPHY COLOR.ME Global Design Director Kate Reid explains this shade of stunning red is best-suited for those with “natural or golden skin tones. If you have this coloring, try turning to red, peach, coral, orange, amber, gold, and apricot hues this fall.” Inspired? Keep clicking to see all the most complementary reds.

Rih Rih returned to her former red head roots at the 2019 BET Awards—and has fans speculating that a new album might be on the horizon, too.

19 Sabina Karlsson

Cited often as one to watch, this Afro-Swedish model breaks the stereotype of natural redhead. Swoon.
20 Lana Del Rey



Getty Images


Though she switches back and forth from auburn to dark brown, and even light strawberry blonde, Lana Del Rey rocks deep red with aplomb.
21 Lily Collins



Getty Images


Lily Collin's take on red is bright, brazen, and bold. The cherry tone plays up her ahem, lily complexion. Commitment-phobes can fake the funk with strategically placed extensions.
