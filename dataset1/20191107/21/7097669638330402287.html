          <b>This is our best look yet at Ford's upcoming electric crossover, likely to be called <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/mach-e">Mach E</a>.</b>
        </li>

          <b>Its styling is said to draw inspiration from the Mustang, and that's in full display here.</b>

          <b>The Mach E will <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29577360/ford-electric-crossover-release-date/">make its debut November 17</a> just before the L.A. auto show.</b>

      <p>Ford wasn't kidding around when it said its new electric crossover would look like a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/mustang">Mustang</a>. These spy photos of the new model, said to be called Mach E, clearly display several classic Mustang styling cuesâ€”although we're not sure how we feel about how they look applied to a vehicle like this.</p>
      <p>There's a fair amount of <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/jaguar/i-pace">Jaguar I-Pace</a> in the Mach E's overall shape, as it's similarly long and low with smooth surfacing along the sides. But the slim headlights, familiarly shaped "grille" cutout, and three-bar taillights clearly identify it as a member of the Mustang family, at least in terms of looks.</p>

      <p>Mechanically, it won't share anything at all with Ford's famed pony car, as it is slated to ride on Ford's new architecture engineered specifically for EVs. That will mean a floor-mounted battery pack said to provide 300 miles of range, and a likely setup of both front- and rear-mounted electric motors that will provide all-wheel-drive capability.</p>
      <p>Ford will share lots more information about the Mach E when it formally debuts November 17. But in the meantime, you can sow your excitement (or discontent) by looking at these spy photos.</p>
