      <p>“This guy is amazing and I wouldn’t be at the level that I’m at without him.”</p>
      <p>Jones is waiting for a fitness test to see if he can rejoin Scott on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m really hoping. I still don’t know.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been dancing today a lot, I’ve been doing that, it’s been feeling really good.</p>
      <p>“But I need to be passed by the physio.”</p>
      <p>Scott said she did not mind who she danced with in the next show, adding: “Whether I’m dancing with Neil or dancing with Kev, they’re both amazing guys.”</p>
