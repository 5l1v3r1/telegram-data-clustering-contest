Twitter in Shreds Over Don Trump Jr.’s Childhood Memories About Hanging Out With Michael Jackson

07 Nov 2019, 21:50


Don Junior’s new book is being marketed with a warning that it is not for those who would rather see the US fail than succeed. Among other things in the book, the US president’s son has refuted claims that his father is racist by saying that he was allowed to spend time with Michael Jackson when he was a child.

Donald Trump Jr. has sparked debate on Twitter over a part in his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, where he defends his father, US President Donald Trump, against claims that he is racist. One of his arguments that such accusations are false is that his dad let him hang out with Michael Jackson, who had an apartment in New York's Trump Tower.
“Given all the things my father has been called, particularly a ‘racist', it sure sounds odd that he’d let his son vacation with a black man or hang out with Michael Jackson, doesn’t it? If he’s a racist, he’s sure not very good at it”, his work says, as cited by The Independent.
However, this argument was interpreted differently on Twitter, as many alluded to allegations that the “King of Pop” sexually abused children, accusations that were recently rekindled by HBO’s documentary Leaving Neverland.












​In his literary work, the website of which says “Caution! If you'd rather see this country fail than succeed under President Trump, this book might not be for you”, the 41-year-old, who serves as an executive in The Trump Organisation, did not shy away from praise for his father and insisted that he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize more than Barack Obama.



​
The incumbent president’s son also lambasts former President George W. Bush as a “loser” and calls Robert Mueller a “feeble old fool”, referring to the latter's probe into the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections as a “crooked investigation”.
