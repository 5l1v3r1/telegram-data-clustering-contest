NATO allies clash after Macron says alliance experiencing ‘brain death’

07 Nov 2019, 21:45

ISLAMABAD: Twitter is the gift that keeps on giving, and on Wednesday Jemima Goldsmith hilariously trolled Pakistani cleric Mufti Kifayatullah after he accused her of being cousins with what can only be described as his take on a human embodiment of WikiLeaks.
While featuring on a TV show this week, the cleric declared that he knew who “Wiki Leaks” actually was, assigning WikiLeaks a person called Vicky Leaks, who he confirmed was a cousin of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith.
Goldsmith retweeted the video circulating social media with the hashtags #VickyLeaks, and wrote a series of humorous jabs at Kifayatullah to her audience of over 3 million.
“For those who don’t speak Urdu — apparently I have a first cousin called “Wiki” — who set up Wikileaks — which is a Zionist tool, supporting Imran Khan’s Zionist agenda,” wrote Goldsmith in a tweet. “This from a so called Islamic scholar/cleric.... “Wiki’ cousin hai Jemima ka,” (Wiki is Jemima’s cousin) followed by a series of laughing emojis.
