Apple fixes background app bug with iOS and iPadOS 13.2.2
The update addresses cellular data issues in addition to the background app bug.

Today, Apple released a minor update for the operating systems running on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. Labeled iOS 13.2.2 (or iPadOS 13.2.2 for the iPad), the key bullet point in this update is a fix for a widely reported (and apparently RAM-management-related) bug in iOS 13 that saw apps quitting and losing their state while running in the background.
All the other changes listed for this update are bug fixes as well. Issues addressed include multiple problems with cellular service and reception, corrupted emails when using S/MIME encryption, a charging problem when using YubiKey accessories, and a bug involving Kerberos authentication in Safari.
Here are Apple's release notes for iOS 13.2.2. The iPadOS release notes are the same, except they omit the bullet point about fixing a cellular data bug:

iOS 13.2.2 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:



Fixes an issue that could cause apps to quit unexpectedly when running in the background


Resolves an issue where iPhone may temporarily lose cellular service after a call


Addresses an issue where cellular data may temporarily not be available


Fixes an issue that caused replies to S/MIME encrypted email messages between Exchange accounts to be unreadable


Addresses an issue where using Kerberos single sign-on service in Safari may present an authentication prompt


Resolves an issue where charging may be interrupted on YubiKey Lightning-powered accessories



This marks the seventh iOS software update since the release of iOS 13 less than 50 days ago. As we've noted before, this is an unprecedented release cadence from Apple, which clearly marks some internal changes and reflects an effort to get ahead of bugs that shipped with an ambitious—and it appears from the outside, rushed—iOS 13 and iPadOS release.
iOS and iPadOS 13.2.2 are available today for all devices that are supported by iOS 13. You can find the option to update in the Settings app on your device.
