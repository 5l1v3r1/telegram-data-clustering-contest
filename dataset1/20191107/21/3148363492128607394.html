      <h2>A Hill-HarrisX poll <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/469263-most-democrats-say-they-would-vote-for-a-democratic-socialist">released</a> on Wednesday shows that 75 percent of Democrats would vote for a Democratic Socialist candidate.</h2>

      <p>In contrast, only 26 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of independents say they would back someone who describes themselves as a Democratic Socialist.</p>
      <p>The Hill reported on its poll, which the media outlet said comes after a number of far left candidates were elected to Congress in 2018, including the Squad — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA):</p>
      <blockquote>Younger voters were also more likely to throw their support behind a self-described democratic socialist. Seventy-four percent of those aged 18-34 said they would back a candidate with the tag, compared to 52 percent of those aged 35-49 and 30 percent of those aged 50-64. However, voters were nearly evenly split on the term overall: 48 percent of those polled said they would support a democratic socialist, while 52 percent said they would not.</blockquote>
      <p>The Hill noted that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is the only one running for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination who has embraced that title and has defended his ideology as carrying on the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt “New Deal,” <a href="https://www.austincc.edu/lpatrick/his1302/deal.html">redistribution</a> of wealth model.</p>
      <p>The Hill-HarrisX online survey asked questions of 523 registered voters between Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. The margin of error for the full sampling is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.</p>
