      <p>The man then walked into the Wendy’s and followed the woman into the bathroom, police said. After the couple came out of the restroom, the woman went behind the counter. Investigators said the suspect walked up to the counter and argued with the woman before going behind the counter as employees were calling the police.</p>
      <p>The man then grabbed the woman by the arm, and forced her out of the Wendy’s, police said.</p>
