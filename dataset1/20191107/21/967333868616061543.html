The release said al-Qosi has encouraged lone-wolf attacks against the United States in online propaganda.</p>
      <p>The State Department also noted that al-Qosi was a Guantanamo detainee after his capture in Pakistan in 2001. He was returned to Sudan in 2010 two years after pleading guilty to supporting al-Qaeda.</p>
