      <h1>Disney CEO Says Deadpool and R-Rated Content Will Stay on Hulu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:15:34+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>The Disney+ service is set to launch next week with a number of new shows and older favorites from the company’s library. Fortunately, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-07/inside-disney-bob-iger-on-star-wars-pixar-and-more">Bloomberg</a> that <b>Deadpool</b> and other mature programming will still have a home even if it’s not on Disney+.</p>
      <p>According to the report, “Edgier Fox fare, such as TV’s <b>Family Guy</b> and the exuberantly R-rated <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/deadpool"><b>Deadpool</b></a> films, will remain on Hulu.”</p>
      <p>Disney acquired a controlling interest in Hulu from Comcast <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/media/disney-hulu-comcast.html">earlier this summer</a>. It should serve as a strong secondary service to Disney+. In fact, Disney currently offers subscription plans that include both, along with ESPN+ for $12.99.</p>
      <h3>RELATED: <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/470499-tim-miller-wanted-the-thing-to-fight-juggernaut-in-deadpool-2"><b>Tim Miller Wanted The Thing To Fight Juggernaut In Deadpool 2</b></a></h3>
      <p>Iger didn’t break down specifics as to what other programming would make its way to Hulu. But the R-rated <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/x-men"><b>X-Men</b></a> movie <b>Logan</b> seems like a safe bet, along with other Fox programming that doesn’t fit the Disney mold. For another example, <b>Die Hard</b>, will probably make for great Christmas viewing on Hulu.</p>
      <p>When Disney+ launches on November 12, subscribers should get a better idea of how programming will be lined up. In the meantime, it’s great to see that <b>Deadpool</b> still has a streaming service to call home.</p>
      <p>What do you think about Disney dividing up programs between two streaming services? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
