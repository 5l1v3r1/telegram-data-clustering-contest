      <p>(Reuters) - Ontario police said on Thursday they have arrested the father of two boys aged 9 and 12, who were found dead on Wednesday night, and charged him with two counts of first-degree murder.</p>
      <p>Police originally received a medical assist call to a house in Brampton, Ontario, a city west of Toronto, at around 11 p.m. local time on Wednesday, where they found the boys deceased at the scene.</p>
      <p>Police said the call came from within the house and they are not looking for other suspects. The Peel Regional Police identified the arrested man as 52-year old Edwin Bastidas.</p>
      <p>No obvious signs of trauma were found on the bodies, and it was only “a little bit later” that the deaths were determined to be suspicious, Heather Cannon, a constable with the Peel Regional Police, told reporters on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The cause of the boys’ deaths has not been released. Bastidas will appear in court on Thursday for a bail hearing, the police said.</p>
