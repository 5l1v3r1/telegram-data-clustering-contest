The former FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss appeared to accuse the Senegal international of going to ground too easily in a recent interview, comments Jurgen Klopp responded to by denying his claims.

""I think it's a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee, but I will just play my football like I'm always doing,"" Mane said, according to Reuters.
""I don't pay attention to what he's saying because it's part of football. If the 'dive' will give me a penalty, then I will do it.
""Why not? But what coach Jurgen (Klopp) said is correct. I do not dive.""
