      <h2>This is a great weekend for live music</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:56:07+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:56</time> by <a rel="author">Joel Patenaude</a></address>
      <p>This is the weekend to see bands heard on mainstream radio (The Chainsmokers, Goo Goo Dolls) and local favorites (WheelHouse and every act at Flannel Fest). We also call out the Winter Art Fair Off the Square, a stage play and a couple comedians.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MUSIC</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://madisonorpheum.com/event/joe-bonamassa/"><b>Joe Bonamassa, The Orpheum Theater</b></a><br/><i>Thursday, Nov. 7, 8 p.m.</i><br/>Guitar slinger Joe Bonamassa, who has traded licks on stage with B.B. King and Eric Clapton, can legitimately claim to have redefined blues-rock with 21 of his albums, released since 2000, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard blues chart. His show at the Orpheum will likely live up to its billing as "the guitar event of the year."</p>
      <p><a href="http://flannelfest.com/"><b>Flannel Fest South, High Noon Saloon</b></a><br/><i>Friday, Nov. 8, 6 p.m.</i><br/>Flannel Fest, now in its sixth year, brings together five American bands born-and-bred in Wisconsin. Milwaukee's Trapper Schoepp and The Listening Party and Madison's The Mascot Theory, Beth Kille Band and The North Code will all play at this benefit for the Keep Wisconsin Warm/Cool Fund, which helps keep the power on for people in financial need. The show is Friday, then it moves Saturday night to the Gibson Music Hall in Appleton.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thewinnebago.com/shows/wheelhouse"><b>WheelHouse, The Winnebago</b></a><br/><i>Friday, Nov. 8, 9 p.m.</i><br/>If you would prefer your roots rock played in the country-bluegrass vein, WheelHouse is playing two shows Friday night at The Winnebago. The first new album release show of the night is sold out, but earlier this week tickets were still available for the 9 p.m. show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/397756934423861/"><b>My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Crucible</b></a><br/><i>Friday, Nov. 8, 7:30 p.m.</i><br/>My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult has been making electronic-industrial-rock dance music for more than 30 years. Groovie Mann and Buzz McCoy founded the band in Chicago and became the target of censorship campaigns for their making satirical references to Satan in their lyrics and stage shows. Also on the bill of the Friday night show at Crucible is CONFORMCO, BIOCARBON13, daddybear and DJ Ecto.</p>
      <p><a href="http://melharmonymusic.com/"><b>Twin Composers Melharmony Festival</b></a><br/><i>Friday-Saturday, Nov. 9-10,</i><br/>Western and Indian music traditions will converge this weekend for the Twin Composers Melharmony Festival in Madison. Friday will include a concert at Madison Memorial High School with accomplished Indian singers, flute and guitar players joined by young people from all over the U.S. The highlight of the two-day event is Sunday night at the Middleton Performing Arts Center. That's when L Shankar, on 10-string double violin, and Chitravina N Ravikiran, on a 20-string slide, will be joined by Wisconsin Melharmonic Orchestra in playing "Lakshya — String Vision 2030."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.alliantenergycenter.com/Upcoming-Events/EventId/1565/e/the-chainsmokers-28-apr-2017"><b>The Chainsmokers, Veterans Memorial Coliseum</b></a><br/><i>Saturday, Nov. 9, 7 p.m.</i><br/>The Chainsmokers, a DJ duo, started out remixing songs by indie artists. They've gone on to score huge hits, such as "Roses," "Don't Let Me Down" and "Something Just Like This." A younger crowd will likely be on hand to hear them at the Coliseum.</p>
      <p><a href="https://madisonorpheum.com/event/goo-goo-dolls/"><b>Goo Goo Dolls, Orpheum Theater</b></a><br/><i>Sunday, Nov. 10, 8 p.m.</i><br/>Then Sunday night at the Orpheum Theater come '90s-era Goo Goo Dolls — known for their enduring radio hits "Iris," "Slide" and "Sympathy." The 30-plus-year-old rock band is touring in support of its 12th album, "Miracle Pill," released in June.</p>

        <b>THEATER</b>
      </p>

The show centers on a gathering of five middle-aged siblings in their childhood home. One of them is Ann, who reminisces about playing Peter Pan in a community theater production in her youth — conjuring the magic of Neverland and youthful imagination that that story was all about.</p>
