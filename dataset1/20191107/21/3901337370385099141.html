      <p>The former FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss appeared to <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/pep-guardiola-fires-dig-at-liverpool-s-african-superstar/666615">accuse the Senegal international of going to ground too easily</a> in a recent interview, comments <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/jurgen-klopp-reacts-to-pep-guardiola-s-sadio-mane-comments/666745">Jurgen Klopp responded to</a> by denying his claims.</p>
      <p>Guardiola then, in an attempt to clarify his statement, insisted he was not trying to take aim at Mane, who has now said he will not take too much note of what the City manager has said about him.</p>

      <p>"I think it's a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee, but I will just play my football like I'm always doing," Mane said, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>"I don't pay attention to what he's saying because it's part of football. If the 'dive' will give me a penalty, then I will do it.</p>
      <p>"Why not? But what coach Jurgen (Klopp) said is correct. I do not dive."</p>
