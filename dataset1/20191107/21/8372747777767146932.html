      <p>Large parts of the US may experience record low temperatures as an Arctic blast sweeps across the Midwest and Northeast through the middle of next week.</p>
      <p>Nearly two-thirds of the country will be vulnerable to unseasonably cold temperatures.</p>
      <p>"We are in a pattern where multiple waves of cold are moving in from Canada and impacting the Central and Eastern US," CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said Thursday.</p>
      <p>"One wave of cold came in late last week, another is moving in today and tomorrow, and the coldest blast by far moves in early next week."</p>
      <p>For much of the country east of the Rocky Mountains, the cold wave could mean temperatures 20-30 degrees below average.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cold-weather records could be broken</b>
      </p>
      <p>Starting Tuesday morning, record low temperatures are possible across Texas and Oklahoma, along with parts of the Ohio Valley.</p>
      <p>By Wednesday, there could be more than a dozen record lows in the Deep South and the Gulf Coast, Ward said.</p>
      <p>In parts of Mississippi and Alabama, highs aren't likely to rise out of the 30s Wednesday. For those areas, that's more than 10 degrees colder than usual even in mid-January.</p>
      <p>The cold temperatures have had unusual side effects in some places.</p>
      <p>In the Kansas City area, residents were saying they smelled an unusual odor.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service in Kansas City <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSKansasCity/status/1192422075043958784">tweeted</a> out a map and blamed the bad smell on a culprit more than 300 miles north.</p>
      <p>The odor of manure from a large stock farm was trapped in a part of the atmosphere that moved southward with the cold front as it passed over Kansas City, meteorologists said.</p>
