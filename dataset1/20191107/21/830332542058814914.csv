This is the weekend to see bands heard on mainstream radio (The Chainsmokers, Goo Goo Dolls) and local favorites (WheelHouse and every act at Flannel Fest). We also call out the Winter Art Fair Off the Square, a stage play and a couple comedians.

MUSIC

Joe Bonamassa, The Orpheum TheaterThursday, Nov. 7, 8 p.m.Guitar slinger Joe Bonamassa, who has traded licks on stage with B.B. King and Eric Clapton, can legitimately claim to have redefined blues-rock with 21 of his albums, released since 2000, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard blues chart. His show at the Orpheum will likely live up to its billing as ""the guitar event of the year.""
Flannel Fest South, High Noon SaloonFriday, Nov. 8, 6 p.m.Flannel Fest, now in its sixth year, brings together five American bands born-and-bred in Wisconsin. Milwaukee's Trapper Schoepp and The Listening Party and Madison's The Mascot Theory, Beth Kille Band and The North Code will all play at this benefit for the Keep Wisconsin Warm/Cool Fund, which helps keep the power on for people in financial need. The show is Friday, then it moves Saturday night to the Gibson Music Hall in Appleton.

My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, CrucibleFriday, Nov. 8, 7:30 p.m.My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult has been making electronic-industrial-rock dance music for more than 30 years. Groovie Mann and Buzz McCoy founded the band in Chicago and became the target of censorship campaigns for their making satirical references to Satan in their lyrics and stage shows.

Friday will include a concert at Madison Memorial High School with accomplished Indian singers, flute and guitar players joined by young people from all over the U.S. The highlight of the two-day event is Sunday night at the Middleton Performing Arts Center. That's when L Shankar, on 10-string double violin, and Chitravina N Ravikiran, on a 20-string slide, will be joined by Wisconsin Melharmonic Orchestra in playing ""Lakshya — String Vision 2030.""
The Chainsmokers, Veterans Memorial ColiseumSaturday, Nov. 9, 7 p.m.The Chainsmokers, a DJ duo, started out remixing songs by indie artists.
