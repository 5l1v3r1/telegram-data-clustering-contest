      <h1>Ray J Is Apparently Trying to Get Suge Knight Out of Prison, Coming for Kim’s Bag</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T03:45:20+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 03:45</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Murphy</a></address>
      <p>In news that would sound far-fetched on even the most unrealistic of reality-TV shows, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7648897/Ray-J-talks-Trump-administration-potential-pardoning-Suge-Knight.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a><i> </i>reported on Wednesday evening that Ray J is trying to get <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/american-dream-american-knightmare-showtime-review.html">Suge Knight</a> released from prison. According to the report,<i> </i>the <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop</i> star and one of Kim Kardashian’s more memorable exes is in “secret talks” with the Trump administration in an attempt to procure a pardon for Knight, who is currently <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/01/suge-knight-has-been-charged-with-murder.html">serving a 28-year prison sentence for murder</a>. In 2018, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/suge-knight-takes-plea-deal-in-2015-murder-case.html">Knight pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter</a> in a hit and run that fatally injured his associate, Terry Carter, on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/suge-knight-indicted-for-threatening-to-kill-movie-director.html">set of the film <i>Straight Outta Compton</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Ray J’s interest in procuring a pardon for Knight comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/21/suge-knight-signs-life-rights-ray-j/">Knight recently signing over his life rights to Ray J</a>. While his new business partnership with Knight may be partly responsible for Ray J’s interest in getting him pardoned, the <i>Daily Mail </i>posits that it might stem from competition with his ex, <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189956773374939136&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2019%2F11%2F2019-best-celebrity-halloween-costumes.html"><s>Elle Woods</s></a> Kim Kardashian. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/2019-best-celebrity-halloween-costumes.html">As Kim would like everyone to remember</a>, she has devoted much of her spare time to issues regarding prison reform, from aiding incarcerated individuals in their quest for freedom to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/why-kim-kardashian-was-back-at-the-white-house.html">helping former inmates get jobs</a>. A source told <i>DailyMailTV</i> that “Ray J is very competitive and always has been. He saw what Kim was able to do with her work in the criminal justice system with the Trump administration and he is determined to do the same.” Maybe Ray J should focus on keeping <a href="https://twitter.com/onicado/status/1026697952662773760">his hat in one place on his head while filming <i>Love &amp; Hip Hop</i></a>, and leave the legal stuff to, like, actual lawyers?</p>
