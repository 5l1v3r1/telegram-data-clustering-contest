Conspiracy Theory: The Kardashians and the Royal Family Are Exactly the Same

07 Nov 2019, 03:00

As you know, the Kardashians and the royals have lots in common: They’re both blessed to be friends with Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Meghan and the Kardashians have kinda, sorta had the same boss (Suits and KUWTK are owned by NBC Universal). They’re both run by powerful matriarchs. They’ve attended parties together. But this goes deeper than famous people doing the same famous people stuff. Could these dynasties actually be secret mirror images of each other? We’re here with the evidence.
People they have in common:

Kim and Meghan are both *actually* close with Serena Williams…not just “met one time at a party” friends but “text each other advice” friends.
Meghan and Jameela worked on a British Vogue issue together and Jameela low-key hates the Kardashians. Awk.
Harry and Will both know Harry Styles, and he is a confirmed Kendall Jenner ex.
Meghan and your favorite human Chrissy Teigen played in a flag football tournament together, and Chrissy/the Kardashians are good friends.





Freakish coincidences:

Prince George and North West were born in 2013. Saint West and Princess Charlotte were born in 2015. Chicago, Louis, Stormi, and True were all born in 2018.





And…


Meghan, Kim, William, and Kate were all born freakishly close together.
Meghan and the Kardashians all grew up in L.A., which makes them cooler than you by default.
The Kardashians went to Marymount High School in L.A., and Meghan went to Immaculate Heart. Those schools play each other in sports. (Imagine a Kim K./Meghan Markle soccer game!)


Kate’s and Kim’s weddings (the Kris Humphries round) were within four months of each other.





Plus…


Kim did this really bizarre thing where she designed shoes for Kate??? FWIW, Kate probably never wore them.
Kate and Kim both had really terrible pregnancy complications.
Harry/Will and Kim/Kourtney/ Khloé all lost a biological parent at a young age, and both of these families’ widowed parents got remarried after super-public divorces.


Overlapping events:

The Kardashians and Meghan were at the NBC Upfronts in 2014 and 2015, walking the red carpet, probs minutes apart.
Meghan and Kendall went to the same British Fashion Awards; Meghan gave out an award.


Times they’ve done the same thing:

Kim and Meghan both wore Givenchy for their weddings (for Kim, it was the the Kanye round).

Not to mention…


Kim and Meghan have worn the same Black Halo dress (all right, all right, 10 years apart and it was in different colors).
Meghan and Kylie wore the same Maggie Marilyn dress within three months of each other.
Kim and Kate celebrated the 100th British Vogue: Kate on the cover, Kim at the party.
Both Prince Harry and Kim became more popular because of ~sexy scandals~. Harry’s nudes were leaked, and Kim had that sex-tape situation.
