      <p>CONSUMER group Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Health (J&amp;J) and Lazada Group have partnered to incubate emerging brands in South-east Asia and China.</p>
      <p>Both companies will help these brands reach and engage more Chinese consumers by leveraging J&amp;J’s market insights and offline distribution channels, and e-commerce player Lazada’s regional ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Tim Deng, Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Health China managing director, said the partnership will serve as a gateway to "bring out" local China brands to reach South-east Asian consumers. At the same time, it would "bring in" South-east Asian products to "inspire Chinese consumers".</p>
      <p>"In addition, we will support a vibrant ecosystem of startups and entrepreneurs in the Belt and Road Initiative region with access to the world-class open innovation expertise within the Johnson &amp; Johnson global network," Mr Deng added.</p>
      <p>Qian Yi, general manager of Lazada Cross-Border business, said that through the partnership, the connectivity between the South-east Asia market and Chinese consumers can be further strengthened, while also bringing more quality products and services to China from South-east Asia.</p>
