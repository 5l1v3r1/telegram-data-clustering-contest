美参院多数党领袖：若今审判弹劾案 总统会判无罪

07 Nov 2019, 03:37

【中新网】美国参议院多数党领袖麦康奈尔5日说，如果现在举行弹劾审判，参议院会宣布总统特朗普无罪。据报道，麦康奈尔对记者说：“我敢说，我很肯定这件事会如何结束。如果（审判）是在今天，我认为结果是显而易见的，这个案件不会导致总统被撤职。所以现在的问题是参议院想要在这件事上花多长时间？”这名肯塔基共和党人补充说，他还没有和参议院少数党领袖舒默讨论如何处理弹劾案的问题。但他表示，两人可能会先看看前参议院两党领袖达施勒和罗特在克林顿弹劾案期间达成的协议。关于特朗普和肯塔基共和党参议员保罗确认举报人身份的呼吁，麦康奈尔5日不愿置评，他还对特朗普要求乌克兰总统调查其政治对手的做法表示了担忧。

US Senate Majority Leader: If the trial is impeached, the president will be acquitted

07 Nov 2019, 03:37

[China News] US Senate Majority Leader McConnell said on the 5th that if the impeachment trial is held now, the Senate will declare President Trump not guilty. According to reports, McConnell told reporters: ""I dare say, I am sure how this will end. If (trial) is today, I think the result is obvious, this case will not lead to the president being dismissed. So the question now is how long does the Senate want to spend on this matter?” The Kentucky Republican added that he has not discussed with the Senate Minority Leader Schumer how to deal with the impeachment case. But he said that the two may first look at the agreement reached by the former Senate bipartisan leaders Daschler and Roth during the Clinton impeachment case. Regarding the appeal of Trump and Kentucky Republican Senator Paul to confirm the identity of the reporter, McConnell declined to comment on the 5th. He also expressed concern that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political opponents.
