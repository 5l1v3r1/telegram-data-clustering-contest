中国将恢复进口 加拿大牛肉和猪肉

07 Nov 2019, 03:07

【路透渥太华讯】加拿大总理特鲁多(Justin Trudeau)周二表示，中国将恢复进口加拿大牛肉和猪肉。大约四个月前中加两国外交争端升级后中国停止进口上述产品。“今天有好消息告诉加拿大农户：加拿大对中国的猪肉和牛肉出口将恢复，”特鲁多发推特称。中国驻加拿大大使馆暂时没有置评。2018年12月，加拿大警方应美国要求逮捕中国华为首席财务长孟晚舟。之后不久，中国逮捕了两名加拿大人，后来他们被指控从事间谍活动，目前仍被拘留。这些事件导致中加双边紧张关系升级。截至8月，按贸易额衡量，中国是加拿大第三大猪肉市场，进口额为4.91亿加元(3.73亿美元)。加拿大对中国猪肉出口激增是因为亚洲部分地区爆发非洲猪瘟疫情。“我们与中国长期以来的贸易关系对双方十分重要，这对两国而言意味着迈出重要一步，”加拿大肉类协会主席Chris White在一份声明中称。加拿大红肉行业9月预计，中国暂停进口已导致该行业损失近1亿加元。

China will resume importing Canadian beef and pork

07 Nov 2019, 03:07

[Reuters, Ottawa] Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that China will resume importing Canadian beef and pork. China stopped importing the above products about four months ago after the escalation of diplomatic disputes between China and Canada. “There is good news today telling Canadian farmers that Canada’s pork and beef exports to China will resume,” Trudeau said. The Chinese Embassy in Canada has not commented for the time being. In December 2018, the Canadian police arrested Meng Huazhou, chief financial officer of China Huawei, at the request of the United States. Soon after, China arrested two Canadians who were later accused of espionage and are still being detained. These incidents have led to an escalation of bilateral tensions between China and Canada. As of August, China was Canada's third-largest pork market by trade volume, with imports of 491 million Canadian dollars ($373 million). Canada’s surge in pork exports to China is due to the outbreak of African swine fever in parts of Asia. “Our long-standing trade relationship with China is very important to both parties, which means an important step for both countries,” said Canadian Meat Association President Chris White in a statement. The Canadian red meat industry is expected in September that China’s suspension of imports has caused the industry to lose nearly $100 million.
