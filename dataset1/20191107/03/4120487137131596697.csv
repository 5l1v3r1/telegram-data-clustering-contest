波音787梦幻客机被曝 氧气系统或存故障：且为蓄意组装

07 Nov 2019, 03:39

【海外网】一名曾是美国波音公司的员工曝料称，787梦幻客机（787 Dreamliner）的氧气系统存在问题，如果机舱突然减压，乘客可能没有氧气。据英国广播公司（BBC）6日报道，约翰巴内特（John Barnett）说，测试表明，多达四分之一的氧气系统可能有故障，并且在需要时可能无法正常工作。他还声称，有故障的零件是被故意在波音一家工厂的生产线上安装的。曾任质量控制工程师的巴内特在波音工作了32年，直到2017年3月因健康原因退休。从2010年起，他被聘为波音南卡罗来纳州北查尔斯顿工厂的质量经理。该工厂是参与建造787梦幻客机的两家工厂之一，该飞机是一架最先进的现代客机，广泛用于世界各地的长途航线。尽管在服役初期出现了初期的问题，但事实证明，这架飞机大受欢迎，并为公司带来了利润。巴内特说，由于波音急于将新飞机从生产线下线，组装过程很匆忙，不得不在安全性上妥协。巴内特表示，尽管突然减压事件很少见，但确实会发生。在2018年4月，一架西南航空公司的飞机被损坏的发动机碎片击中后，一扇窗户炸开了。一名坐在窗户旁边的乘客受了重伤，后来死亡。但是，其他乘客却能够依靠紧急氧气供应，并没有受到伤害。巴内特表示，他试图进一步调查此事，但遭到波音公司经理的阻挠。2017年，他向美国联邦航空局（FAA）投诉，公司未采取任何措施解决该问题。但是，FAA表示无法证实这一说法。而波音否认该指控，并表示所有飞机的制造均达到最高的安全性和质量水平。报道称，巴内特并不是唯一对波音的制造工艺表示担忧的员工。今年早些时候，在埃塞俄比亚航空公司737 Max坠机后，四名现任或前任雇员联系了FAA热线以报告潜在问题。

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was exposed to an oxygen system or malfunction: and was deliberately assembled

07 Nov 2019, 03:39

[Overseas] A former Boeing employee of the United States revealed that there is a problem with the oxygen system of the 787 Dreamliner. If the cabin is suddenly decompressed, passengers may not have oxygen. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on the 6th, John Barnett said tests show that up to a quarter of the oxygen system may be faulty and may not work properly when needed. He also claimed that the faulty parts were intentionally installed on the production line of a Boeing factory. Barnett, a former quality control engineer, worked in Boeing for 32 years until March 2017 for retirement due to health reasons. Since 2010, he has been hired as the Quality Manager for the Boeing North Carolina Charleston plant. The plant is one of two plants involved in the construction of the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art modern airliner that is used extensively on long-haul routes around the world. Despite the initial problems in the early days of service, the aircraft proved to be very popular and brought profits to the company. Barnett said that because Boeing was eager to take the new aircraft off the production line, the assembly process was in a hurry and had to compromise on security. Barnett said that although the sudden decompression event is rare, it does happen. In April 2018, after a Southwest Airlines aircraft was hit by damaged engine fragments, a window exploded. A passenger sitting next to the window was seriously injured and later died. However, other passengers were able to rely on an emergency oxygen supply and were not harmed. Barnett said he tried to investigate the matter further, but was blocked by the Boeing manager. In 2017, he filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the company did not take any action to resolve the issue. However, the FAA said it could not confirm this claim. Boeing denied the allegation and said that all aircraft are manufactured to the highest level of safety and quality. According to reports, Barnett is not the only employee who expressed concern about Boeing's manufacturing process. Earlier this year, after the Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash, four current or former employees contacted the FAA hotline to report potential problems.
