        <i>Underwater volcano sees old island disappear below the waves, replaced by a bigger one nearby</i>
      </p>
      <p>An undersea volcanic eruption in the Tongan archipelago has sunk one island and created another one that is three times larger, according to a report by geologists released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Taaniela Kula, of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/tonga">Tonga</a> Geological Service, said the new island is estimated to be about 100 metres wide and 400 metres long, and is situated about 120 metres west of its now-submerged predecessor, Lateiki island.</p>
      <p>The upheaval followed an 18-day undersea eruption last month in an area prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.</p>
      <p>The new island lies between Kao and Late in the Pacific island nation’s northern Ha’apai group of islands.</p>
      <p>Tonga sits on the notorious Ring of Fire, an area of frequent seismic activity in the Pacific ocean and which is responsible for about 90% of the world’s earthquakes.</p>
      <p>In late 2014 the eruption of an undersea volcano created another Tongan island that is now home to plants and birdlife.</p>
