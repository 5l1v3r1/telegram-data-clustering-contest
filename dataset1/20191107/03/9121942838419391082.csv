EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Police say an apparent neighborhood dispute in north Eugene left three people wounded and the alleged gunman dead after turning the gun on himself.
The Register-Guard reports the victims were taken to Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield.
Their conditions were not known and Police Chief Chris Skinner said he did not know if the victims, who all suffered gunshot wounds, were expected to survive.
Police were called at 1:13 p.m. Wednesday to a report of shots fired.
When police arrived, Skinner said they found a situation “that feels like a neighborhood dispute that went really, really bad.”
The alleged shooter, estimated to be in his 70s, was found dead. Skinner says at least two handguns, owned by the man, were found at the scene.
The Lane County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI and Oregon State Police also responded.
