國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜被爆曾於2011年購買價值7200萬元、位於北市南港的豪宅，遭綠營狂批是「假庶民」、「錢從哪裡來」；韓則解釋房子是貸款買的、後來因財務壓力也賠售出去，整個交易過程完全合法，更批一件單純合法的買賣權利轉售，竟在選舉期間遭到公開、侵害個人資料，強烈質疑洩漏交易資訊者之背後動機。
請問你是否同意韓國瑜所說，被爆7200萬買豪宅是侵犯個資？

The Kuomintang presidential candidate, Yukyu Yu, was born in 2011. He bought a luxury home in the Nangang of Beibei City, which was worth 72 million yuan. He was madly criticized by the green camp as ""false people"" and ""where does the money come from?"" Han explained that the house was bought by a loan. Later, due to financial pressures, the entire transaction process was completely legal. A simple legal sale of resale rights was made. During the election period, it was disclosed and infringed on personal data. The motivation behind the leakage of information was strongly questioned.
Do you agree with South Korea’s Yu that the explosion of the luxury home of 72 million is a violation of capital?
