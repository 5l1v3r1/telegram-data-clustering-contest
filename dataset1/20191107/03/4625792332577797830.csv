07 Nov 2019, 03:03 by Madison Dibble
President Trump criticized Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s attorney, for his 2017 tweets calling for the president to be impeached.
Zaid sent several tweets in 2017 calling for a “rebellion” and a “coup” against Trump, hoping it would lead to an impeachment.
During his rally in Louisiana on Wednesday night, Trump bashed Zaid as a “sleazeball.”
“It’s all a hoax,” said Trump. “It’s a scam. And you know who helps them? These people right back here, the media.”
Trump pointed to Zaid’s tweet claiming that CNN could “play a key role” in his impeachment.



“Can you believe this?” Trump asked. “And this was done a long time ago!”



Trump has been adamant that the whistleblower be identified and testify in the impeachment hearings.
Zaid vowed to keep his client’s identity private, calling any effort to reveal the name “the pinnacle of irresponsibility.”
