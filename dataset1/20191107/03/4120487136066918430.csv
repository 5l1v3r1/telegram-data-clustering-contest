【雅加达Tribun新闻网11月6日讯】周三（11月6日），国家警察总署法医实验室中心（Puslabfor）小组已赴雅加达东区扎贡区干冬墟村化粪池爆炸现场取样。法医实验室中心小组组长法伊法尔说，化粪池中有一氧化碳和甲烷有毒气体。他补充说，样本处理需要两周时间。印尼科学院（LIPI）就致一人身亡的化粪池爆炸事件表态。研究人员内妮·辛塔娃尔拉尼说，甲烷是易燃的气体，是一种能源。点燃报纸放进化粪池是非常危险的行为。11月4日，雅加达东区扎贡区干冬墟村一户人家化粪池发生爆炸，一名住在200米远的男子听见爆炸声，他以为是卡车轮胎的爆炸声。为化粪池进行污泥处理的工人躺在化粪池旁边一动不动。警方在这一户人家前拉起警戒线。据悉，清理化粪池的工人点燃纸张放进化粪池之后发生了爆炸，他掉入两米深的化粪池后死亡。房主也受了伤。扎贡区警察局刑事侦查组主任汤姆·希莱特说，工人想要证明给房主看已完成化粪池清理工作。本周二，汤姆说：“他点燃报纸放进化粪池里，想要证明给房主看，化粪池的污水已经排干了。”片刻之后，化粪池发生了爆炸，站在化粪池上面的工人掉了进去，被送至医院，经抢救无效死亡。汤姆说，虽然掉进发生爆炸的化粪池里，但工人身上无任何烧伤痕迹。
