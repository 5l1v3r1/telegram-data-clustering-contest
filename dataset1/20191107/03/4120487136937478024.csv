07 Nov 2019, 03:37

【中新社伦敦】英国议会当地时间6日凌晨解散，英国大选选战随即拉开帷幕。英国首相鲍里斯约翰逊6日上午前往白金汉宫觐见女王伊丽莎白二世，女王正式签署公告解散议会。据英国媒体报道，约翰逊将于6日晚些时候在唐宁街10号发表讲话，正式启动竞选活动。英国上次大选于2017年举行。上月29日，英国议会下院通过表决同意解散议会，并定于12月12日提前举行大选。议会解散后，议会下院全部650个席位自动空缺。包括首相在内的所有内阁大臣仍将留任，直至新内阁组建完成。据英国广播公司报道，即将到来的大选是英国自2015年以来的第三次大选，也是英国近百年首次在圣诞节所在的12月举行大选。6日，英国各党派纷纷启动竞选活动。民调显示，英国执政党保守党的支持率领先反对党工党与自由民主党，但多家英国媒体认为，在未来五周的时间里，民意可能出现波动，目前难以预料大选结果。

The dissolution of the British parliament

07 Nov 2019, 03:37

[China News Agency, London] The British Parliament was dissolved in the early hours of the 6th local time, and the election of the British general election immediately began. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went to Buckingham Palace on the morning of the 6th to see Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen officially signed an announcement to dissolve the parliament. According to British media reports, Johnson will speak at 10 Downing Street later on the 6th to officially launch the campaign. The last election in the UK was held in 2017. On the 29th of last month, the lower house of the British Parliament agreed to dissolve the parliament by voting, and is scheduled to hold an election in advance on December 12. After the dissolution of the parliament, all 650 seats in the lower house of the parliament were automatically vacant. All cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister, will remain in office until the new cabinet is completed. According to the BBC, the upcoming general election is the third general election in the UK since 2015. It is also the first time in nearly 100 years that the UK has held a general election in Christmas. On the 6th, various political parties in the UK launched campaigns. Polls show that the British ruling Conservative Party's support rate is ahead of the opposition Labor Party and the Liberal Democrats, but many British media believe that public opinion may fluctuate in the next five weeks, and it is difficult to predict the outcome of the election.
