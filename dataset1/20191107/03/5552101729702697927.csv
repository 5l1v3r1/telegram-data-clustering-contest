07 Nov 2019, 03:18 by 林俊宏
「台灣民政府」祕書長林志昇涉嫌虛構美國軍政府將接管台灣，吸金超過7億元，桃園地檢署今年7月間將他起訴，不過，今天上午傳出林志昇在家跌倒致顱內出血死亡，轄區警方已報請桃園地檢署相驗，追查有無外力介入。
林志昇遭起訴後移審院方，檢方請求法官續押，不過，合議庭最後裁定林志昇1000萬元交保，但每天晚間8點以前需前往蘆竹警分局南崁派出所報到。
未料，全案在法院審理之際傳出林志昇已死亡，檢警初步調查，林志昇在本月2日，在桃園住家跌倒，被人發現後，先扶到臥室床上休息，不久後即開始口吐白沫，林志昇隨即被送至敏盛醫院，到院時已幾乎沒有生命跡象，院方仍緊急插管搶救。
過了2天，林志昇拔管後，一度有恢復正常呼吸並轉到普通病房，後來脈搏越來越弱，林志昇被家屬載回住家準備處理後事，直到6日晚間確定死亡，事後家屬通知法醫到場。
不過，法醫發現醫院診斷證明書上寫著顱內出血，且左耳因摔倒有外傷，屬意外死亡，無法直接開立死亡證明，儘管死者家屬對於林志昇死因沒有意見，但檢警為求謹慎，決定進行相驗。
