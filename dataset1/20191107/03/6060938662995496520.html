      <p>ZAGREB: A Croatian animal rights group said on Wednesday it would file charges against a local footballer who kicked a chicken to death during a semi-professional match over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The incident took place on Sunday when a brood of chickens ran onto a pitch in eastern <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Croatia">Croatia</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the players, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ivan-Gazdek">Ivan Gazdek</a> from the home team <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NK-Jelengrad">NK Jelengrad</a>, ran after the birds, kicked one with his foot and then chucked it over the fence in a flurry of feathers.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was red-carded for unsporting behaviour.</p>
      <p>The NGO Animal Friends also strongly condemned the "shameful act and cowardly behaviour of the player against an innocent animal who died with crushed bones and in pain".</p>
      <p>The group said it would file charges against the player for the "criminal act of animal killing or torture".</p>
      <p>If formally charged and found guilty, the player could face up to one year in prison.</p>
      <p>Gazdek, who claims to be an animal lover that owns several pets, argued to local media that the killing "was not intentional".</p>
      <p>"I ran towards the chickens to chase them away, swung my foot and accidentally killed one," he said.</p>
      <p>"Chickens are constantly entering the pitch interrupting the match. The pitch is full of faeces, these are unhygienic conditions," he added in comments to the local <i>24sata</i> paper.</p>
