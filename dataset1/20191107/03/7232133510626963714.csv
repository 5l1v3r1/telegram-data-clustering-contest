Ethereum (ETH) Forming Bearish Pattern, $186 Hold Key

07 Nov 2019, 03:08


Ethereum price is struggling to climb above the $192 and $195 resistances against the US Dollar.
It seems like a head and shoulders pattern forming with support near the $188 and $186 levels.
This week’s key bullish trend line is intact with support near $188 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).
Bitcoin is still facing a lot of hurdles near the $9,400 and $9,500 resistance levels.


Ethereum price is forming a bearish breakdown pattern versus the US Dollar, while bitcoin is trading below $9,400. ETH price could decline heavily if it breaks $186.

Ethereum Price Analysis
Recently, there was a decent rise in Ethereum above the $188 and $190 resistance levels against the US Dollar. Moreover, ETH price traded above the $192 resistance area and settled above the 100 hourly simple moving average.
However, the price faced a strong resistance near the $195 level and a high was formed near $195. There was a downward move from the $195 and the price traded below the $190 level.
At the outset, Ethereum is holding the $188 and $186 support levels. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $192 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $188 low is near the $192 zone.
Therefore, an upside break above the $192 level might push the price towards the $195 resistance. An intermediate resistance is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $188 low.
On the downside, there are many supports near the $188 and $186 levels. More importantly, this week’s key bullish trend line is intact with support near $188 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.
It seems like there is a head and shoulders pattern forming with support near the $188 and $186 levels. Thus, if there is a bearish break below the $186 support, the price could start a fresh decline in the near term.
The next key support is near the $185 level. Any further losses are likely to push the price back towards the main $178 support area.
