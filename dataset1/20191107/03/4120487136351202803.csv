软银14年来首见季度亏损 因愿景基金惨亏89亿美元

07 Nov 2019, 03:07

【路透东京讯】日本软银集团周三公布14年以来的首次季度亏损，因旗下愿景基金录得9700亿日圆(89亿美元)亏损，主要受到WeWork及优步等主要投资标的估值下滑影响。这次亏损的程度令人质疑公司创办人孙正义投资烧钱草创公司的高风险策略，而孙正义目前正准备成立第二档大规模的投资基金。软银集团公布7-9月当季录得营业亏损7040亿日圆(65亿美元)，上年同期则为获利7060亿日圆，根据路孚特数据，分析师预估中值为营业亏损480亿日圆。上个月，软银被迫耗资逾100亿美元抢救共享办公初创企业WeWork。此前WeWork的首次公开发行(IPO)尝试以失败告终。软银对WeWork投资的公允价值再第二季下降了34亿美元。有沙特阿拉伯支持的愿景基金(Vision Fund)，在截至9月底已经向88家公司投资了707亿美元。不包括退出的部分，这些投资目前价值776亿美元。随着市场越来越关注其投资的初创企业的盈利路径，软银正艰难地将这些初创企业推向市场；推动旗下投资公司上市对释放资本、维持软银投资优势来说非常关键。愿景基金对上市公司的投资在当季价值大多下滑；这些投资中包括优步(Uber)、Slack Technologies和Guardant Health。对优步的投资价值持续下滑，该公司亏损规模继续扩大，且IPO之后的锁定期结束，其股价本周触及新低。软银的投资活动得到孙正义企业帝国麾下其他支柱业务的支撑，包括软银公司(SoftBank Corp)，该公司周二公布第二季营业利润增长9%，超出预期。软银并未披露对当前业务年度的预估，称有太多不确定因素。

Softbank saw its first quarterly loss in 14 years. The vision fund suffered a loss of 8.9 billion US dollars.

07 Nov 2019, 03:07

[Reuters Tokyo] Japan's Softbank Group announced its first quarterly loss in 14 years on Wednesday, as its vision fund recorded a loss of 970 billion yen ($8.9 billion), mainly due to the decline in the valuation of major investment targets such as WeWork and Uber. The extent of the loss raises questions about the company’s founder, Sun Zhengyi’s high-risk strategy to burn money, and Sun Zheng is currently preparing to set up a second-largest investment fund. Softbank Group reported an operating loss of 704 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in the July-September quarter and a profit of 706 billion yen in the same period last year. According to Lufite, analysts estimate a median loss of 48 billion. Japanese yen. Last month, Softbank was forced to spend more than $10 billion to rescue WeWork, a shared office startup. Earlier, WeWork's initial public offering (IPO) attempt ended in failure. The fair value of Softbank's investment in WeWork fell by $3.4 billion in the second quarter. The Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund has invested $70.7 billion in 88 companies by the end of September. Excluding the exit portion, these investments are currently worth $77.6 billion. As the market pays more and more attention to the profit path of the startups it invests in, Softbank is struggling to bring these start-ups to market; promoting the listing of its investment companies is critical to unlocking capital and maintaining Softbank's investment advantage. The Vision Fund’s investment in listed companies declined mostly in the current quarter; these include Uber, Slack Technologies and Guardant Health. The value of Uber’s investment continued to decline, the company’s loss scale continued to expand, and the lock-up period after the IPO ended, and its share price hit a new low this week. Softbank's investment activities were supported by other pillar businesses of Sun Justice's corporate empire, including SoftBank Corp., which reported second-quarter operating profit growth of 9% on Tuesday, exceeding expectations. Softbank did not disclose its estimate for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertainties.
