河南婚宴豬肘瞬間一掃光 大叔：半年沒吃肉了

07 Nov 2019, 03:02

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】一場非洲豬瘟引爆中國大陸豬肉危機，豬肉價格飆升，民眾直言吃不起。近日，河南某婚姻酒席上，一盤豬肘剛上桌，瞬間就被客人搶光的視頻在網絡熱傳。視頻中一位大叔意猶未盡地說，已半年沒吃過豬肉了。
11月5日，網上傳出一段視頻顯示，在河南洛陽一婚禮宴席上，一盤豬肘子剛剛端上桌，一桌的客人紛紛拿筷子搶肉，瞬間將其「秒殺」。其中一位大叔直言不諱地說，已半年沒吃過豬肉了。



這段視頻引爆網路熱議，網民紛紛留言：「我也好久沒吃豬肉了。」
「這兩年能吃得起肉的，都是土豪。」
「諷刺啊！！！！強大到連豬肉都吃不起了。」
美中貿易戰開打後，中共報復美國，拉攏俄羅斯，封殺美國進口豬肉，改從俄羅斯進口豬肉。然而，俄羅斯爆發非洲豬瘟疫情後尚未完全扑滅，結果導致非洲豬瘟疫情在中國大陸蔓延。
雖然中共官方對此極力否認，但不少證據顯示，大陸爆發非洲豬瘟疫情的時間點，與從俄羅斯進口豬肉的時間點相吻合。
此外，由於中共當局防疫措施及監管不到位，非洲豬瘟疫情迅速蔓延全國，導致生豬大量死亡，豬肉短缺，價格飆升，一些地方豬肉甚至高達58元1斤。
中國是豬肉消耗大國，豬肉是民眾必不可少的菜餚，但由於豬肉價格太高，老百姓直呼「吃不起」，怨聲載道。
加拿大前駐華大使趙樸（Guy Saint-Jacques）日前表示，中國已耗盡豬肉儲備，現在幾乎32個省都出現疫情，損失了1億頭豬，豬肉供應至少要10年時間才能恢復正常。
近日，一張《連山回鍋肉創始人代木兒菜譜》在大陸社交媒體上引發熱議。菜譜上顯示，一份精品晾竿回鍋肉（10片）的菜品，標價高達400元人民幣。
隨後，飯店負責人代梅對媒體表示，菜譜是真實的，因為成本上漲太快，只能定這個高價。
她介紹說，現在每斤豬肉價格漲到了58元，這種精品晾竿回鍋肉，製作一份要10片，每片生肉重量在4兩多，僅用肉就需要近5斤。由於成本上漲，她們也沒辦法。
由於豬肉價格飆升，豬肉甚至被當成奢侈品的代名詞，有大陸網友製作晒豬肉炫富的視頻，調侃天價豬肉，引發網友共鳴。



目前，中國大陸正面臨一場嚴重的豬肉危機，中共總理李克強近日在西安視察時，突然拐進路邊一家小店，詢問當地豬肉價格。可見豬肉問題不可小覷，已牽動中南海高層。

Henan wedding banquet pigs and elbows are swept away in an instant. Uncle: No meat for half a year.

07 Nov 2019, 03:02

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] An African pig plague detonated the pork crisis in mainland China. The price of pork soared and the people could not afford to eat. Recently, in a marriage banquet in Henan, a plate of pork knuckles just came to the table, and the video that was robbed by the guests was instantly transmitted on the Internet. In the video, a big uncle said that he had not eaten pork for half a year.
On November 5th, a video appeared on the Internet. At a wedding banquet in Luoyang, Henan, a plate of pork knuckles was just on the table. A table of guests took chopsticks to grab meat and instantly ""snap"" them. One of the uncles said bluntly that he had not eaten pork for half a year.



This video detonated the Internet and the netizens wrote: ""I haven't eaten pork for a long time.""
""It is a local tyrant who can afford meat in these two years.""
""Satire!!!! It’s so strong that even pork can’t afford it.”
After the US-China trade war began, the CCP retaliated against the United States, rallied Russia, blocked US imports of pork, and imported pork from Russia. However, the outbreak of African swine fever in Russia has not yet been completely extinguished, resulting in the spread of African swine fever in mainland China.
Although the CCP officials strongly deny this, there is a lot of evidence that the time of the outbreak of African swine fever in the mainland coincides with the time of importing pork from Russia.
In addition, due to the quarantine measures and supervision of the Chinese authorities, the African swine fever epidemic spread rapidly across the country, resulting in a large number of pigs dying, shortage of pork, and soaring prices. In some places, pork is as high as 58 yuan and 1 kg.
China is a country with a large consumption of pork. Pork is an indispensable dish for the people. However, because the price of pork is too high, the people call ""can't afford it"" and complain.
Canada's former ambassador to China, Guy Saint-Jacques, said that China has exhausted pork reserves, and now there are epidemics in almost 32 provinces, losing 100 million pigs. It takes at least 10 years for pork to return to normal.
Recently, a ""Lianshan Hui Pan meat founder Dai Muer recipe"" has sparked heated discussion on the mainland social media. The menu shows that a dish of fine-baked pork (10 pieces) is priced at 400 yuan.
Subsequently, the person in charge of the hotel, Demei, told the media that the recipe is real, because the cost rises too fast and can only set this high price.
She said that the price of pork per kilogram has risen to 58 yuan. This kind of fine-baked pork is made into 10 pieces. The weight of each piece of raw meat is more than 4, and only 5 kg is needed for meat. Because of the rising costs, they have no choice.
As the price of pork soared, pork was even synonymous with luxury goods. There were videos from mainland netizens who made sun-baked and smashed the rich, and ridiculed the price of pork, which caused netizens to resonate.



At present, mainland China is facing a serious pork crisis. When Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese Communist Party, recently visited Xi'an, he suddenly turned into a small shop on the roadside to inquire about local pork prices. It can be seen that the pork problem cannot be underestimated and has already touched the high level of Zhongnanhai.
