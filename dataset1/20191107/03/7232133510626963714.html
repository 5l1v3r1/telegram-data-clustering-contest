      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, there was a decent rise in Ethereum above the $188 and $190 resistance levels against the US Dollar. Moreover, ETH price traded above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/06/ethereum-eth-bulls-eyeing-further-upsides-bitcoin-facing-hurdles/">$192 resistance area</a> and settled above the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>However, the price faced a strong resistance near the $195 level and a high was formed near $195. There was a downward move from the $195 and the price traded below the $190 level.</p>
      <p>At the outset, Ethereum is holding the $188 and $186 support levels. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $192 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $188 low is near the $192 zone.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $192 level might push the price towards the $195 resistance. An intermediate resistance is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $195 high to $188 low.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many supports near the $188 and $186 levels. More importantly, this week’s key bullish trend line is intact with support near $188 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>It seems like there is a head and shoulders pattern forming with support near the $188 and $186 levels. Thus, if there is a bearish break below the $186 support, the price could start a fresh decline in the near term.</p>
      <p>The next key support is near the $185 level. Any further losses are likely to push the price back towards the main $178 support area.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price seems to be preparing for the next move, with key supports near $186 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. If the highlighted head and shoulders pattern plays well, the price could decline towards the $180 and $178 support levels in the short term.</p>
