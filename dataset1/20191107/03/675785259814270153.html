      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T03:13:23+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Chris Murphy, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A 63-year-old teacher killed her husband and then herself after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a pupil at her school, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>A SWAT team was sent to Emma Ogle's home in North Carolina when her husband Michael failed to show up for work.</p>
      <p>Colleagues had called a family member who went to the house and phoned the police after discovering it was barricaded.</p>
      <p>By the time the SWAT team arrived at the scene on Wednesday morning, both were dead.</p>
      <p>It is believed Ogle shot her 59-year-old husband before turning the gun on herself.</p>

      <p>She allegedly began a relationship with a 17-year-old in the spring and it became sexual during the summer.</p>
      <p>The age of sexual consent is 16 in North Carolina, but is still deemed illegal when one party has authority over the other, in this instance a teacher over a pupil.</p>
      <p>Police said it was actually the student who reported her to a staff member at Garinger.</p>
      <p>Ogle had been suspended from the school with pay pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>
