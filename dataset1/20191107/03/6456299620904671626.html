      <p>An unspecified number of smart TVs manufactured by Samsung will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/netflix-samsung-smart-tv-roku/">lose native support for Netflix next month</a>, the companies said in an announcement this week. From a report:<i> Netflix app installed -- or available for -- Samsung smart TVs manufactured in 2010 and 2011 (C and D lineups) -- and likely sold for many years after that -- will stop functioning December 2, Samsung alerted customers this week. In a statement, a company spokesperson said these TV models were sold only in the U.S. and Canada. In its statement, the top smart TV manufacturer advised affected customers to look for a game console, streaming media player, set-top box or other devices that still support Netflix app to continue their binge-watching sessions. A Netflix spokesperson cited technical limitations for the change.</i> The developement comes weeks after Netflix alerted several Roku customers that they, too, will lose access to the streaming service on December 1.</p>
