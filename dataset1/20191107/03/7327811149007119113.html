      <p>JAMESBURG, New Jersey (WABC) -- Two people died in a fast-moving fire that tore through a home in New Jersey early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Firefighters arrived at the house on Sheridan Street in Jamesburg at approximately 3:45 a.m. to find heavy flames that caused extensive damage to the structure.</p>
      <p>The victims, whose identities have not been released, were discovered a short time later.</p>
      <p>Lawanda Kitchen is the sister of one of the victims and identified them as her 53-year-old brother, Clifford Kitchen, and a family friend. She said her nephew, who was previously unaccounted for, had stayed with a friend Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>She said her brother had a huge heart and would often allow struggling individuals to stay at his house until they got back on their feet.</p>
      <p>"He would never turn anyone away," she said. "If he had a friend in need, he would open his doors to anybody."</p>
      <p>The exact causes of the death will be determined by the Middlesex County Medical Examiner's Office.</p>
      <p>No firefighters or police officers were injured.</p>
      <p>The Jamesburg Fire Department, the Jamesburg Police Department, the Middlesex County Office of the Fire Marshal, and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office all responded to the scene.</p>
      <p>The investigation into the cause of the fire is active and is ongoing.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Sergeant Jason Muller of the Jamesburg Police Department at (732) 521-0011, or Detective Deon McCall of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office at (732) 745-3848.</p>
