每天生活費2元 女大生吳花燕擊碎中共脫貧謊言

07 Nov 2019, 03:34

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】貴州女大學生吳花燕，每天只有2元人民幣生活費，靠吃白飯拌糟辣椒生活的消息，登上了中國媒體新聞的頭條，同時也戳穿了中共所聲稱的絕對貧困問題即將得到解決的脫貧神話。
現年24歲的吳花燕是貴州銅仁市松桃縣沙壩河鄉茅坪村炮爐山組人，目前是貴州盛華職業學院經濟學專業大三學生。
吳花燕4歲那年母親生病過世。2014年，她升入高中時，父親得肝硬化撒手人寰。從此，她和弟弟只能寄宿在同樣貧困的大伯家，依靠300元的低保維持生計。
這筆錢大部分都花在為弟弟治病上面，吳花燕每天僅花2元買飯，從來捨不得吃早餐，中午吃饅頭，晚餐還是饅頭，打飯也基本上是只打白米飯。
曾有5年多時間，糟辣椒就是她唯一的下飯菜，由於長期的營養不良，吳花燕身體一直不好。高三時，她的身體開始出現明顯的病狀，整日狂掉頭髮、眉毛也掉光，仍然沒有到醫院去檢查。
至今她身高仍只有1.35米，體重僅43斤。相當於一個正常8、9歲女孩的身高和體重。
上了大學後，她開始勤工儉學，做兩份兼職。2018年起，她的雙腳開始浮腫起來。今年9月29日，她的身體狀況再度惡化。她的同學硬是背她到醫院。
經醫院檢查，吳花燕的三個心臟瓣膜都有了嚴重問題，僅僅手術費起碼都要20多萬，更不用說後期的治療。
吳花燕對弟弟說，「弟弟，我們不治了，帶姐姐回家。」弟弟聽完，偷偷地跑到病房外嚎啕大哭。
後來，在病友的督促和勸說下，她想了多天後才同意在網上發起眾籌。

吳花燕的遭遇引起廣泛同情

吳花燕的遭遇被媒體曝光後引起廣泛同情，同時也招致許多中國民眾對政府的不滿。
有網友批評中共在建政70周年活動上花費巨大，卻沒有幫助吳花燕這樣的窮人。「盛世螻蟻」，「擊碎了一切謊言！」
「24歲，身高135厘米，體重43斤，我們吃了什麼盛世鎮靜劑，才能每天面對如許苦難，謊言，罪行，卻視而不見，充耳不聞！ 」
「教育部一年300多億的獎學金撒給亞非拉留學生，好歹留一點給本國貧困學生也不至於這麼慘啊！」
據報，吳花燕的故事經媒體披露後，各界紛紛捐款，5天内，她獲捐47萬。
吳花燕寫感謝信說，像「丟黑夜裡重見太陽一樣」。 然而，她的身體，很多方面已經無法逆轉了。
貴州是中國最窮的省份之一。長期關注中國大陸貧困問題的民營企業家胡力任曾多次考察該省。
他對自由亞洲說，地方政府所有的扶貧資金進入貧困地區，並沒全額到底層貧困人口手中，都被地方政府剋扣了，以修路等建設的名義拿去了。
胡力任說，中共政府目前制定的扶貧標準也有問題。所謂的脫貧不僅是吃飽飯而已，也應包括完善的醫療和教育等各方面機制，比如，沒有受到良好教育，只是吃飽了是脫貧嗎？

脫貧神話早已成泡沫

早在2015年11月23日，習近平主持中共中央政治局會議時，提出5年內實現脫貧，扶貧開發工作被指為「啃硬骨頭」。
2017年10月，中共十九大上，習近平又表示，將脫貧列為主要目標，2020年實現農村貧困人口全數脫貧。
今年10月17日，習近平再次稱，「絕對貧困問題，即將歷史性地得到解決，這將為全球減貧事業作出重大貢獻」。然而，事實已經證明，習近平的脫貧神話被戳破。
過去40多年來，雖然中國經濟快速增長，社會財富總量明顯增加，湧現了一大批富豪，但一些經濟不發達地區，特別是農村，仍然存在着大量的窮人。
世界銀行的數據顯示，約5億中國人——占人口約40％，生活在每天不足5.5美元的條件下。
而一篇題為「中國有多少窮人，他們究竟貧窮到何種程度？」一文中則說，中國有一種窮人，叫做「絕對貧窮」，他們的年收入不到人民幣683元，平均每天不到人民幣1.87元，他們過着「衣不蔽體，食不果腹，饑寒交迫」的生活。
這樣的窮人，中國還有2100萬人。
中國還有一種窮人，叫做「低收入」者，他們的年收入不到人民幣958元，平均每天不到人民幣2.63元。
這樣的窮人，中國有2個億。
文章說，按照聯合國的計算標準，中國的窮人有10億之多，其中9億在農村，1億在城市。脫貧或開始富起來的，只是3億人，他們大部分集中在城市。

The daily living expenses are 2 yuan. The female student Wu Huayan crushes the CCP to get rid of poverty.

07 Nov 2019, 03:34

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Guizhou female university student Wu Huayan, who only has a living allowance of 2 yuan per day, has made headlines in Chinese media news by relying on the news of eating white rice and pepper, and also debunked the CCP’s claim. The myth of poverty alleviation is about to be solved.
Wu Huayan, 24, is a member of the Gunlushan Village of Maoping Village, Shabahe Township, Songtao County, Tongren City, Guizhou Province. She is currently a junior in economics at Guizhou Shenghua Vocational College.
When Wu Huayan was 4 years old, her mother died of illness. In 2014, when she was promoted to high school, her father had cirrhosis. Since then, she and her younger brother can only stay in the same poor Dabo family, relying on the 300 yuan minimum living to maintain their livelihood.
Most of this money is spent on treating the younger brother. Wu Huayan only spends 2 yuan a day to buy rice. She never wants to eat breakfast. She eats steamed buns at noon, dinner is still a steamed bun, and rice is basically only white rice.
For more than five years, the bad pepper was her only meal. Wu Huayan’s body has been bad due to long-term malnutrition. When she was in her third year, her body began to show obvious symptoms. She lost her hair all day and her eyebrows fell. She still did not go to the hospital for examination.
She is still only 1.35 meters tall and weighs only 43 pounds. It is equivalent to the height and weight of a normal 8- or 9-year-old girl.
After attending college, she began to work and study, doing two part-time jobs. Since 2018, her feet have begun to swell. On September 29 this year, her physical condition deteriorated again. Her classmates are hard to carry her to the hospital.
After hospital examination, Wu Huayan's three heart valves have serious problems, only the surgery costs at least 200,000, not to mention the later treatment.
Wu Huayan said to her younger brother, ""Younger brother, we are not cured, take my sister home."" After listening to the younger brother, he sneaked out into the ward and cried.
Later, under the supervision and persuasion of the patient, she thought for a few days before agreeing to launch crowdfunding online.

Wu Huayan’s encounter caused widespread sympathy

Wu Huayan’s experience was exposed by the media and caused widespread sympathy. At the same time, it also caused many Chinese people to be dissatisfied with the government.
Some netizens criticized the CCP for spending a lot on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the government, but did not help the poor like Wu Huayan. ""Sheng Shi ants"", ""breaking all lies!""
""24 years old, height 135 cm, weight 43 kg, we have eaten any sedatives in order to face such sufferings, lies, crimes, but turn a blind eye and turn a deaf ear!""
""The Ministry of Education has donated more than 30 billion scholarships to Asian, African, and Latin American students. It is not so bad for the poor students in the country!""
According to reports, after Wu Huayan’s story was disclosed by the media, various sectors donated money. Within 5 days, she was donated 470,000.
Wu Huayan wrote a thank-you letter saying, ""Like the sun in the night."" However, many aspects of her body have been irreversible.
Guizhou is one of the poorest provinces in China. Hu Liren, a private entrepreneur who has long been concerned about poverty in mainland China, has visited the province many times.
He told Free Asia that all the poverty alleviation funds of local governments have entered the poverty-stricken areas, and they have not been fully paid to the bottom of the poor. They have been deducted by the local government and taken away in the name of building roads and other construction.
Hu Liren said that the poverty alleviation standards currently formulated by the Chinese government are also problematic. The so-called poverty alleviation is not only a meal, but also a comprehensive medical and educational mechanism. For example, if you are not well educated, is it just to get rid of poverty?

The myth of poverty alleviation has long been a bubble

As early as November 23, 2015, when Xi Jinping presided over the Politburo meeting of the CPC Central Committee, he proposed to achieve poverty alleviation within five years, and poverty alleviation and development work was referred to as ""hard bones.""
In October 2017, at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping also stated that poverty alleviation was the main goal. In 2020, the rural poor will be lifted out of poverty.
On October 17 this year, Xi Jinping once again said that ""absolute poverty will soon be resolved historically, which will make a major contribution to the cause of global poverty reduction."" However, the facts have proved that Xi Jinping’s myth of poverty alleviation has been poked.
Over the past 40 years, although China’s economy has grown rapidly, the total amount of social wealth has increased significantly, and a large number of rich people have emerged. However, in some economically underdeveloped areas, especially in rural areas, there are still a large number of poor people.
According to World Bank data, about 500 million Chinese – about 40% of the population – live on less than $5.5 a day.
And an article entitled ""How many poor people are in China, to what extent are they poor?"" said that China has a poor person called ""absolute poverty"". Their annual income is less than RMB 683, an average daily. Less than RMB 1.87, they lived a life of ""clothing is not covered, food is not enough, and hunger and cold are forced.""
Such a poor, China has 21 million people.
There is also a poor person in China, called ""low-income"". Their annual income is less than RMB 958, and the average daily is less than RMB 2.63.
Such a poor, China has 200 million.
According to the article, according to the United Nations' calculation standards, there are 1 billion poor people in China, of which 900 million are in rural areas and 100 million are in cities. Only 300 million people have been lifted out of poverty or started to get rich. Most of them are concentrated in cities.
