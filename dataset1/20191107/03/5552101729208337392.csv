南韓天團Super Junior成員希澈口才佳又人脈廣，活躍於各大綜藝節目，人來瘋型的他其實性格相當細膩。近日他開直播時，有粉絲眼尖發現鏡頭出現一隻陌生的貓，經過網友細心比對，疑似是已故的同門師妹雪莉的愛貓。
希澈昨（7日）在YouTube開直播，不過畫面右下角有一隻陌生貓咪出現，仔細看是一隻無毛貓，後來還搗蛋跳上電腦桌，出動希澈將牠抱離桌子。有粉絲詢問新貓的來歷，結果希澈僅用一句「祕密」簡單帶過，令人更加好奇。

有網友比對鏡頭中短暫出現的貓耳朵，發現和雪莉生前養的無毛貓相似，推測應該是希澈收養了雪莉的貓，引起網友熱議，紛紛留言：「雪莉以前真的是希澈很喜歡的妹妹…」「是溫柔的人想守護的最美麗的祕密」「哥哥太善良了！真的」「之前一直在想姐姐的貓怎麽辦…看來是有了好的歸宿」，不過也有網友認為，「他們的關係一直都很好，希澈也是很善良的人，但是在並沒有正面回應的情況下大家還是先不要隨意猜測了」。

The Super Junior member of the South Korean group, Hiroshi, is very popular and has a wide network of people. He is active in all kinds of variety shows. He is crazy and he is very delicate. When he started the live broadcast recently, a fan of the eye pointed out that there was a strange cat in the camera. After careful comparison, the suspect was the cat of the late sister Shirley.
Heechul was broadcast live on YouTube yesterday (7th), but there was a strange cat in the lower right corner of the picture. He looked carefully at a hairless cat. Later, he jumped to the computer desk and sent Heechul to take it away from the table. Some fans asked about the origin of the new cat. As a result, Heechul simply used a ""secret"" to make it more curious.

Some netizens compared the cat ears that appeared in the lens for a short time. They found that they were similar to the hairless cats that Shirley had raised before. It was speculated that Heech had adopted Shirley’s cat, causing hot comments from netizens. They all said: ""Shirley used to It is the sister that Heechul likes very much..."" ""It is the most beautiful secret that gentle people want to guard."" ""Brother is too kind! Really."" ""What about the cat that I always thought about my sister... It seems that there is a good home."" However, some netizens believe that ""their relationship has always been very good, and Heechul is also a very kind person, but in the absence of a positive response, we should not arbitrarily guess.""
