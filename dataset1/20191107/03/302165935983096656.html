      <p>MEXICO CITY, Nov 7 — Archaeologists said yesterday they have made the largest-ever discovery of mammoth remains: A trove of 800 bones from at least 14 of the extinct giants found in central Mexico.</p>
      <p>Moreover, they believe they have made the first-ever find of a mammoth trap set by humans, who would have used it to capture the huge herbivores more than 14,000 years ago, said Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).</p>
      <p>“This is the largest find of its kind ever made,” the institute said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The skeletal remains were found in Tultepec, near the site where President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government is building a new airport for Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Some bore signs that the animals had been hunted, leading experts to conclude that they had found “the world’s first mammoth trap,” it said.</p>

      <p>“Mammoths lived here for thousands of years. The herds grew, reproduced, died, were hunted... They lived alongside other species, including horses and camels,” archaeologist Luis Cordoba told journalists.</p>
      <p>Researchers said at least five mammoth herds lived in the area of the find.</p>
      <p>Mexico has been the scene of surprising mammoth discoveries before.</p>
