《陳情令》爆夯出番外篇電影　魏無羨名字被喊11次
07 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 溫雅雯
大陸夯劇《陳情令》榮登今年度網劇播放量第一名，主人公肖戰和王一博谷底翻身人氣爆漲，昨（6日）舉辦銀川互聯網電影節頒獎，肖戰即以此劇和《長安十二時辰》男主角雷佳音共同獲得最佳男主角獎。而製作方打鐵趁熱推出以鬼將軍溫寧和藍思追為主角的番外篇電影《陳情令之生魂》，今日在愛奇藝台灣站上線。



《陳情令之生魂》以鬼將軍溫寧追查扶風城「鬼燈殺人」傳說為起點，意外與藍家小輩藍思追重逢，共同緝凶找出整起事件的真相。雖然與正劇相比，番外篇只有溫寧與藍思追兩名人物，其他角色都是新登場的生面孔，運鏡敘事方式仍保有《陳情令》的特有風格，尤其武打場面拍得非常用心，幾場重要打鬥場景看得相當過癮。

全新的故事別有風味，但電影裡時不時提起「魏公子」、「夷陵老祖」，算算次數多達11次，更出現原版純音樂的〈無羈〉配樂，加上穿著黑服，頭繫紅髮帶的「魏無羨」登場，以原配音員路知行的聲音與溫寧對話，算是一解《陳情令》戲迷的思念之情，但也不禁讓人覺得有蹭原版熱度的味道。

《陳情令》自7月播出，豆瓣分數開低走高，最後幾集的內容還被播出平台以「多付費搶先看」方式大賺一筆，而且先後在天津、泰國與南京舉辦見面會，場場門票秒殺，黃牛票一度喊到6萬人民幣（約新台幣27萬元）。《陳情令之生魂》由于斌和鄭繁星重披溫寧與藍思追人物角色，據傳之後還會有一部院線電影和網路電影的番外篇與戲迷見面，至於大家買不買單，得先從《陳情令之生魂》上線後的反應來觀察了。
