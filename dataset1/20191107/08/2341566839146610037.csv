12強台日大戰爭分組第一 中華隊廖乙忠先發

（中央社記者楊啟芳台中6日電）世界12強B組預賽中華隊與日本確定晉級複賽，明天兩隊交鋒將決定誰是分組第一，中華隊推出廖乙忠先發。廖乙忠表示，每一顆球都會全力投，不會因為先發而保留實力。
廖乙忠為中信兄弟投手，去年參加中華職棒季中選秀雖然落選，不過以自主培訓身分進入兄弟，今年下半季就成為一軍先發輪值，總計投13場都是先發，拿下3勝5敗，防禦率4.36，總冠軍賽也奪下勝投。
廖乙忠這次入選12強賽，一開始定位就是先發投手，3日官辦熱身賽先發投2局，被敲出一發陽春全壘打，失1分，送出1次三振。廖乙忠表示，今天到球場時，投手教練才跟他說要擔任台日戰先發，因為比賽還沒開始，「所以還不知道會不會緊張」。
洲際棒球場是廖乙忠母隊中信兄弟的主場，他表示，會讓自己心情跟例行賽一樣，不要想太多，「不要想說自己是先發就保留實力，畢竟中華隊好的投手很多，每一顆都全力投，一球一球投，把自己該做的本分做好就好」。
廖乙忠2013年參加日職選秀會時也曾落選，他說：「會投給他們看。」他指出，平常就有在看日本職棒，加上有情蒐團隊提供的資料，會以情蒐為主下去投球，其他的就交給隊友，「這次每一隊都很強，都是不能輕忽的隊伍」。
今天賽前洪一中曾說，對日本的先發投手會是胡智為及廖乙忠2選1，因此明天胡智為也有機會上場。胡智為表示，「每一場比賽我都會準備，在牛棚待命，即使沒有要上場丟球，也會讓自己緊急要上場時，能馬上準備好。」
胡智為之前在官辦熱身賽時曾說有些緊張，不過他今天說：「緊張已經都收起來了，之前是因為7年沒在這邊投球，那種緊張是興奮、不是擔心，但比賽前還是要把這種心情收起來。」（編輯：屈享平）1081106
