（中央社記者楊啟芳台中6日電）世界12強B組預賽中華隊以3比0擊退委內瑞拉，晉級複賽，繳出7局好投的張奕賽後表示，這是人生中第一次投滿7局，感到相當不可思議，即使第5局就全身抽筋，也咬牙撐過。
張奕此戰用102球主投7局，僅被敲出4支安打，出現2次保送，送出6次三振，完全沒讓對手攻下分數，第5及第7局雖然遇到得點圈有人，不過都飆出三振化解危機。總教練洪一中也稱讚他：「太棒了，完全壓制對手。」
由於去年張奕才剛棄打從投，他賽後表示：「這場是我人生第一次投到第7局，非常不可思議，其實投到第5局就全身在抽筋了，但還是想盡全力贏下這場比賽，也聽到球迷的加油聲，感謝所有幫助我的工作人員，讓我能有這麼好的表現。」
雖然張奕身體抽筋，不過總教練洪一中表示，上投手丘詢問狀況時，他都說沒有任何異狀，「張奕的回答都很堅定，甚至7局投完要換投時，也是毫無表情，展現十足鬥志，還有求勝意志力，即使後半段開始球路偏高，態度還是非常肯定，真的很謝謝他」。
此戰搭配張奕的捕手林泓育給出「1000分」高評價，他表示，這場比賽主要是配各種變化球種，不過要決勝負時就用直球吊高球，「張奕投的位置也很到位，所以可以做這樣的搭配」。
林泓育也指出，張奕投滿7局對球隊影響很大，是超過預期的結果，「因為我們投手到後面會愈輪愈好，到8、9局一定都是最好的投手上來，明天還有比賽，很多投手也可以休息」。
委內瑞拉總教練素貝羅（Carlos Subero）賽後也稱讚張奕說：「台灣應該要把所有功勞給他，我也想對他脫帽致意，尤其是都能用三振化解危機，吊高球搭配慢速球，投出非常精彩的比賽。」（編輯：林治平）1081107
