07 Nov 2019, 08:42 by 葉文全
學術研討會不再硬梆梆，中市辦「台中學」展創意！台中市政府研考會將於11月15、16日2天在中興大學舉辦「台中學國際研討會」，今年首創「一句話代表台中的Slogan競賽」「2050的台中樣貌學生繪畫競賽」，用庶民的語言和繪畫來帶出台中學的特色，引起廣大師生的迴響。
研考會與中興大學今（7日）特別舉行「台中學國際研討會」活動記者會，由研考會主任委員吳皇昇、中興大學法政學院副院長李長晏一同為活動揭開序幕。現場更邀請知名書法家柳炎辰老師題字，展現台中人文底蘊，研考會吳皇昇代表台中市長盧秀燕歡迎社會各界來中興大學共同討論台中學的過去與未來展望。
吳皇昇表示，「台中共好 宜居偕老」這8字是台中學今年舉辦「一句話代表台中之市民Slogan競賽」的金質獎，這句話充分反映市民對台中未來發展的深層期許！吳皇昇說明，盧市長及市府團隊肩負市民期望，以8大價值HOME-PLUS（友善Hospitality、活力Opportunity、便捷Mobility、共享Ecology、宜居People、均衡Land、智慧Ubiquitous、永續Sustainability）為核心，並用12大發展策略為具體方針，打造「富市台中、新好生活」的承諾。

吳皇昇表示，「2050的台中樣貌學生繪畫競賽」的成果也相當有趣，台中學子畫出未來的台中有飛天車、有任意門、有自我發電建築物等等，展現豐富有創意的願景想像。吳皇昇指出，其實台中市政府也不遑多讓，今年9月由普立茲克獎得主妹島和世所設計的綠美圖，台中市政府克服多重困難正式發包動工，台中巨蛋也開始著手規劃，期盼未來台中的樣貌將讓市民引以為傲。
中興大學法政學院副院長李長晏也提到今年的主題為『創新城市、共融台中』，以台中在地化MIT（行銷Marketing、創新Innovation、轉型Transformation）為會議主軸，融入關於台中當地的地方創生與共榮社會、區域治理與城市發展、人文歷史與地方實踐及經濟產業與環境保育等多元議題，共同探討關於台中的過去、現在到未來的發展軌跡，藉此提升世人對台中之認同。
台中市政府研考會指出，明年台灣燈會在台中的主題為「璀璨台中」，也是台中學研究未來展望很棒的期許，研討會的啟動儀式特別搭配了LED發光球做為象徵，由主委及副院長、贊助商代表一同讓球體發亮，點亮台中的未來，研考會也將透過學術研考活動邀請師生及民眾一起參與109年2月8日至2月23日於后里花博森林園區、馬場園區及108年12月21日至109年2月23日在文心森林公園展出的「2020台灣燈會」，歡迎大家來體驗台中的美，一同展望台中的未來。

07 Nov 2019, 08:42 by Ye Wenquan
The seminars are no longer hard, and the ""Taiwan Middle School"" exhibition of the Central Government Office is creative! The Taichung City Government Research Institute will hold the ""Taiwan High School International Seminar"" at Zhongxing University on November 15 and 16, and this year will create ""Slogan Competition for Taichung"" and ""2050 Taichung Appearance Student Painting Competition"". Using the language and paintings of the untouchables to bring out the characteristics of the middle school, it has aroused the echoes of teachers and students.
The seminar and ZTE University held a special press conference on the ""Taiwan Middle School International Symposium"" today (7th). The director of the research council, Wu Huangsheng, and the vice president of the School of Law and Politics of Zhongxing University, Li Changyu, kicked off the event. At the scene, the famous calligrapher Liu Yanchen was invited to inscribe the inscriptions of Taichung. The researcher Wu Huangsheng on behalf of Taichung Mayor Lu Xiuyan welcomed the community to Zhongxing University to discuss the past and future of Taiwan Middle School.
Wu Huangsheng said that the ""Taiwanese Communist Party is a good place to live in the old age"" is the gold medal awarded by the Taiwanese Middle School this year for ""one sentence representing the Slogan competition of the citizens of Taichung"". This sentence fully reflects the public's deep expectations for the future development of Taichung! Wu Huangsheng explained that Mayor Lu and the city government team shoulder the expectations of the public, with the eight values of HOME-PLUS (Friendly Hospitality, Vibrant Opportunity, Convenient Mobility, Shared Ecology, Livable People, Balanced Land, Smart Ubiquitous, Sustainability Sustainability) as the core. And use the 12 major development strategies as a specific guideline to build a commitment to ""the rich city of Taichung, a new life.""

Wu Huangsheng said that the results of the ""2050 Taichung Appearance Student Painting Competition"" are also very interesting. The middle school students draw the future of Taichung with flying cars, arbitrary doors, self-powered buildings, etc., showing rich and creative visions. Wu Huangsheng pointed out that in fact, the Taichung City Government did not give up much. In September this year, the Taichung City Government officially started the contract with the Pulitzer Prize winner Sister Island and the World Office. The Taichung Dome also began planning. Looking forward to the future of Taichung, the public will be proud of it.
Li Changchun, deputy dean of the School of Law and Politics of Zhongxing University, also mentioned that the theme of this year is ""Innovative City, Inclusive Taichung"", and Tai Chi Localization MIT (Marketing, Innovation, Transformation) is the main axis of the conference, and it is integrated into local innovations in Taichung. The diverse issues of life and co-prosperity society, regional governance and urban development, human history and local practice, and economic industry and environmental conservation jointly explore the development track of Taichung's past, present and future, thereby enhancing the recognition of Taichung.
The Taichung City Government Research Institute pointed out that the theme of the Taiwan Lantern Festival in Taichung next year is ""Taiwanese"", which is also a great expectation for the future of Taiwan Secondary School. The launching ceremony of the seminar is specially matched with the LED luminous ball as a symbol. Together with the deputy dean and sponsor representatives, the sphere will be brightened and the future of Taichung will be illuminated. The seminar will also invite teachers, students and the public to participate in the post-secondary period from February 8 to February 23, 2010.
