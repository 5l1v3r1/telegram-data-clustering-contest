段純貞牛肉麵4度檢出過期食材　竟都是同家分店
07 Nov 2019, 08:51 by 吳妍
新竹縣王座餐飲公司旗下品牌「段純貞牛肉麵」廣三SOGO店連續被查出過期麵條、牛筋和滷豆干，3名員工遭依虛偽標記及偽造文書罪起訴。
根據《自由時報》報導，「段純貞牛肉麵」廣三SOGO店先是去年12月向廠商訂購保存期限僅5天的麵條，但量訂太多，丟掉會變成耗材，增加成本，擔心被總公司責罵情況下，內場黃姓員工向陳姓區經理反映後，陳男指示黃男用白板筆劃掉原本保存期限，多延2天，繼續照用。
同月，因廣三SOGO百貨副總向「段純貞牛肉麵」總公司反映油煙罩清潔不佳，總公司前來處理時一併稽查，卻發現冰箱內有5包保存期限被劃掉、改標的麵條，因此下令丟棄。
時隔不到7個月，又發現「段純貞牛肉麵」廣三SOGO店向另一製麵廠採購陽春麵，同樣訂超過使用量，過期5、6天後，楊姓組長以新塑膠袋重新包裝，並貼上偽造的製造日期與有效日期，下鍋煮給客人吃，但手寫的標籤一看就知道是改標。
今年7月24日，檢調與員警稽查王座餐飲公司全台分店，再度於同一分店「段純貞牛肉麵」廣三SOGO店查出冰箱內有過期滷豆干（1.5公斤已過期1天）和牛筋（1.5公斤已過期3天），因此祭出行政裁罰60萬。
楊姓組長與黃姓員工對犯行均坦承不諱，但陳姓區經理卻不承認有改標且態度不佳，3人遭中檢依虛偽標記及偽造文書罪一併起訴。

Duan Chunjun beef noodles 4 degrees out of expired ingredients are actually the same branch
07 Nov 2019, 08:51 by Wu Hao
The Hsinchu County Throne Catering Company's brand ""Duan Chunyu Beef Noodle"" Guangsan SOGO Store was continuously found out of expired noodles, beef tendon and dried bean curd, and three employees were prosecuted for falsehood and forgery.
According to the ""Free Times"" report, ""Duan Chunyu beef noodles"" Guangsan SOGO store first ordered the noodles with a shelf life of only 5 days from the manufacturer in December last year, but the quantity is too much, and the loss will become consumables, increase the cost, and worry about being scolded by the head office. Next, after the in-house Huang surnamed employee reported to the Chen surnamed district manager, Chen Nan instructed Huang Nan to use the whiteboard pen to cross the original shelf life, and extended it for 2 days to continue to use it.
In the same month, the vice president of Guangsan SOGO Department Store reported to the “Dongchunyu Beef Noodle” head office that the hood was not cleanly cleaned. When the head office came to handle the inspection, it found that there were 5 packages of noodles that were crossed out and changed. Therefore ordered to discard.
After a lapse of less than 7 months, it was discovered that “Duanchunyu Beef Noodle” Guangsan SOGO Store purchased Yangchun Noodles from another noodle factory, and ordered more than the usage amount. After 5 or 6 days of expiration, Yang’s team leader repackaged with a new plastic bag. And affixed the fake manufacturing date and effective date, boiled to the guests to eat, but the hand-written label will be changed as soon as it is seen.
On July 24 this year, the inspection and police officers inspected the throne catering company's entire Taiwan branch, and once again in the same branch ""Duan Chunyu beef noodle"" Guangsan SOGO store found that the refrigerator has expired dried bean curd (1.5 kg has expired 1 day) and beef tendon (1.5 kg has expired for 3 days), so the administrative penalty was 600,000.
The team leader Yang and the staff of Huang’s family confessed to the crimes, but the manager of Chen’s district did not admit that there was a change of bid and the attitude was not good. Three people were prosecuted for the crime of falsehood and forgery.
