      <h1>An Post to secure €100m contract for Department cash payment services</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:23:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>An Post is set to secure a €100m contract from the Department of Social Protection.</p>
      <p>The company has been selected as the preferred bidder for the new cash payment services contract.</p>
      <p>The agreement will run from January 1, 2020, until the end of the following year.</p>
      <p>It means An Post will continue to process social-welfare for at least another two years.</p>
      <p>“In 2018, almost 31 million payments – or 40% of all payments by the Department - were paid in cash through An Post’s network of post offices reaching into local communities throughout the entire country," said Regina Doherty, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>
      <p>"Once the new contract is signed, the arrangements currently in place will remain unchanged for everyone who has chosen to receive their welfare payment through An Post.”</p>
      <p>Debbie Byrne MD of An Post Retails added:</p>
      <p>“An Post welcomes the certainty provided by the latest announcement which will come as good news to Postmasters and our customers.</p>
      <p>"Cash payments to the Department’s clients, which include pensions and Child Benefit, are an important element of the business of post offices and a clear example of the value of the post office network in delivering government services to local communities.</p>
