澳媒刊登希臘裔法輪功學員的修煉故事

07 Nov 2019, 08:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】前不久，澳洲墨爾本希臘社區最大的媒體Neos Kosmos，在其報紙和網站的健康欄目報導了希臘裔法輪功學員比爾·托多里（Bill Thodori）的故事，其題目是：「尋找為什麼這些希臘裔澳洲人都喜歡這種特殊的打坐方式」（Find out why Greek Australians are flocking to this special form of meditation）。
明慧網報導，該文中講述：二零零二年，比爾·托多里從希臘移民到澳大利亞後不久，發現自己的健康突然崩潰了，當時他才二十多歲。
連續幾週頭暈目眩的症狀變成了連續幾個月不間斷的暈眩，他最終決定去看家庭醫生。隨後他被推薦給很多專家，並進行了一系列檢查，但是最終診斷結果都是身體一切正常。然而不久之後，嚴重的暈眩發作迫使比爾放棄了工作。
他想起了在悉尼認識的一位希臘同胞——法輪功學者安東尼（Antoni），於是他在電話中向安東尼傾訴了幾個月來經歷的病痛折磨。安東尼分享了自己修煉法輪大法（又稱法輪功）的體會，鼓勵比爾嘗試。神奇的功效讓比爾折服，他欣喜地說：「不到一個月，我的所有症狀都消失了。」至今比爾修煉法輪大法已經超過十七年，健康快樂，妻子和相繼誕生的兩個女兒都走入大法修煉，一家四口幸福美滿。
文章中還說：法輪大法，又稱法輪功，是一種古老的氣功修煉方法，主要是通過打坐和五套功法改善身心。法輪大法是由李洪志先生在中國創立的，於一九九二年開始廣泛地介紹給民眾，現已在世界各地迅速傳播，在包括澳洲和希臘在內的六十多個國家裡廣受歡迎。
雖然不是宗教，但法輪功確有精神修煉原則和信仰。不僅對身體健康有益，正如比爾等許多人所分享的那樣：改善了健康狀況、使頭腦清晰、還能解除精神壓力，而且通過修煉提升道德品質，還能使人獲得智慧和啟發。法輪大法的三個主要原則是「真、善、忍」，鼓勵修煉者在日常生活中按照這些原則去做。
文章介紹，（法輪大法）兩部主要書籍是《法輪功》和《轉法輪》，後者已被翻譯成超過二十五種語言，包括英語和希臘語。學煉法輪大法是完全免費的，甚至不需要捐贈。比爾是週末費茨羅伊公園（Fitzroy Gardens）煉功點的常客，這樣的煉功點遍布全澳各地。如果天氣等原因導致戶外煉功不方便，人們可在家中煉功，網上也有大量免費的書籍等資料可指導修煉。
由於法輪功不是一個組織，因此您無需註冊自己的名字；在煉功點學或參加一個教功班，如果覺得好，可隨時回來學煉。
文章還提到，儘管這種修煉方法來自中國，但各種文化背景的人們都對這種方法產生了興趣——比爾是墨爾本眾多希臘裔法輪功學員之一。
他說：「就像古希臘人所說的那樣，『擁有健康的心靈，就擁有健康的身體』（Healthy mind， healthy body）。我相信思想能起很大的作用、主導的作用。心存真善忍，不斷煉功、打坐，能使人保持內心平靜，一切都變的更祥和快樂。」
他還表示，在打坐中保持思想清淨對思維特別活躍的人士來說有時候的確構成挑戰，但只需保持恆心，每天堅持煉功，人人都可以做到。
比爾說，除了身體恢復健康，他還見證了自己生活中各個方面的積極變化，從與家人和朋友的關係到工作環境，甚至讓他戒除了駕車時經常超速、易怒的毛病。「修煉後，駕車時內心變的非常平靜。從A地到B地，保持冷靜的心態，雖然花了更長的時間，但感覺時間過得很快。」

如今，比爾修煉法輪大法已十七年了，他和妻子以及兩個分別為十二歲和十歲的孩子自然而然的加入了他的行列。他說：「我有兩個孩子，老實說，有時候看社會新聞真讓人恐懼。但法輪大法（教人向善）帶給人希望。」
這也是比爾為什麼如此熱衷於傳播有關法輪大法消息的原因，「法輪功提升道德品質，基於真善忍原則，還有什麼比這個更好的道德準則呢？」
比爾說：「我遇到的每個人都很好奇，問我義務傳播法輪功如何能做到？我的回答是，因為有好東西就應該無私地分享，我是發自內心希望幫到社區的民眾。」

Australian media published the cultivation story of Greek Falun Gong practitioners

07 Nov 2019, 08:51

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Not long ago, Neos Kosmos, the largest media in the Greek community in Melbourne, Australia, reported on the story of the Greek Falun Gong practitioner Bill Thodori in the health section of his newspaper and website. The title is: ""Find out why Greek Australians are flocking to this special form of meditation"".
According to Minghui.com, the article said: In 2002, shortly after Bill Todori immigrated from Greece to Australia, he found his health suddenly collapsed. He was only in his twenties.
The symptoms of dizziness for several weeks turned into uninterrupted dizziness for several months, and he finally decided to go to the family doctor. He was then recommended to a number of experts and conducted a series of tests, but the final diagnosis was that everything was normal. However, shortly afterwards, a severe dizziness attack forced Bill to give up his job.
He remembered a Greek compatriot who met in Sydney, Falun Gong scholar Antoni, and he confided to Anthony on the phone about the painful experience he had experienced for months. Anthony shared his experience in practicing Falun Dafa (also known as Falun Gong) and encouraged Bill to try. The magical effect made Bill impressed. He said with joy: ""In less than a month, all my symptoms have disappeared."" So far, Bill has practiced Falun Dafa for more than seventeen years, healthy and happy, and his wife and two daughters who have been born one after another. Walking into Dafa cultivation, the family of four is happy.
The article also said: Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong, is an ancient method of practicing Qigong, mainly through meditation and five sets of exercises to improve the body and mind. Founded in China by Mr. Li Hongzhi, Falun Dafa has been widely introduced to the public in 1992. It has spread rapidly around the world and is popular in more than 60 countries including Australia and Greece.
Although not a religion, Falun Gong does have spiritual principles and beliefs. Not only is it good for health, as many people like Bill share: improving health, clearing the mind, and relieving mental stress, and improving morality through cultivation can also lead to wisdom and inspiration. The three main principles of Falun Dafa are ""truthfulness, benevolence, and forbearance"", encouraging practitioners to follow these principles in their daily lives.
According to the article, the two main books (Falun Dafa) are ""Falungong"" and ""Zhuan Falun"", which have been translated into more than 25 languages, including English and Greek. Learning Falun Dafa is completely free and does not even require donations. Bill is a frequent visitor to the Fitzroy Gardens practice site on weekends, and this practice site is spread throughout Australia. If the weather and other reasons lead to inconvenient outdoor cooking, people can practice at home, and there are a large number of free books and other materials on the Internet to guide the cultivation.
Since Falun Gong is not an organization, you don't need to register your name; you can learn at a practice or attend a teaching class. If you feel good, you can come back to study at any time.
The article also mentioned that although this method of cultivation comes from China, people of all cultural backgrounds have become interested in this method - Bill is one of the many Greek Falun Gong practitioners in Melbourne.
He said: ""As the ancient Greeks said, ""Healthy mind, healthy body."" I believe that thought can play a big role and lead. Truth, compassion, and constant practice, meditation, can keep people calm, and everything becomes more peaceful and happy.""
He also said that keeping a clear mind during meditation sometimes poses a challenge to those who are particularly active in thinking, but only need to be persevering and persevere in practicing every day. Everyone can do it.
Bill said that in addition to his health, he also witnessed positive changes in all aspects of his life, from the relationship with family and friends to the working environment, and even let him quit the speeding and irritability of driving. ""After cultivation, the heart became very calm when driving. From A to B, maintaining a calm mindset, although it took longer, I felt that time passed quickly.""

Today, Bill has been practicing Falun Dafa for 17 years. He and his wife and two children, aged 12 and 10, naturally joined him. He said: ""I have two children. To be honest, sometimes it is frightening to watch social news. But Falun Dafa (teaching people to be good) brings hope.""
This is why Bill is so keen to spread the news about Falun Dafa. ""Falun Gong promotes moral quality. Based on the principle of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance, is there any better moral code than this?""
Bill said: ""Everyone I met was very curious. How can I communicate with Falun Gong? My answer is that because there are good things, you should share them unselfishly. I am from the heart who wants to help the community. .""
