      <h3>KTM 390 Adventure will be launched at India Bike Week in Goa in early December and is expected to carry a price tag of around Rs. 3 lakh</h3>
      <p>After years of having us waited, KTM finally pulled the covers off the 390 Adventure at the 2019 EICMA show in Milan, Italy and is accompanied by its smaller sibling, the 250 Adventure. Our video of the 390 Adventure straight from the EICMA floor will show you all the information you need to know about the promising dual-purpose adventure tourer, so make sure to check it out.</p>
      <p>The 390 Adventure was spied numerous times in India and most of the details revealed were there on the production model gladly. In a nutshell, it is a go-anywhere variant of the Duke 390 and KTM says it will give the experience and performance of the 450 Rally machine. As for the powertrain, it comes equipped with the same 373.2 cc single-cylinder liquid-cooled DOHC fuel-injected engine.</p>
      <p>It is good enough to produce a maximum power output of 44 horsepower at 9,000 rpm and 37 Nm of peak torque delivered at 7,000 rpm. It is mated to a six-speed transmission and was expected to have optimised gear ratios for better low- and mid-end grunt but KTM has not made any sprocket changes for quicker acceleration. KTM will be offering switchable ABS system with the 390 Adv.</p>
