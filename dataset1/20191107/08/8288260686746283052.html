      <p>And Holloway has been blown away by Bilic's impact at the Baggies and reckons they are a good bet for promotion, adding that any side that does finish near West Brom will be close to a place in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I had the pleasure of meeting Slaven Bilic last week," He wrote in his column for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/slaven-bilic-making-west-brom-20826010">Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>"Woah what a fella! I was absolutely captivated in his company. It was marvellous.</p>
      <p>"Would I bet against West Brom getting promoted? I don't think I would. Anyone who finishes either one place above them or one place below is going to be very close to being promoted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"They are going to be in that shake-up and I think they are going to be one of the two to go up.</p>
      <p>"I think that is all down to the manager. He filled me with confidence and I don't even play for him.</p>
      <p>"When I sat with him and listened to him it was fantastic. He is the secret behind the solidness they seem to have."</p>
