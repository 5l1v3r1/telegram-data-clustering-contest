        <b>Iran has resumed uranium enrichment at its underground Fordow plant south of Tehran in a new step back from its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iranian authorities also say they have cancelled the accreditation of a UN nuclear inspector.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Engineers restarted the plant's mothballed enrichment centrifuges in "the first minutes of Thursday", the statement said.</p>
      <p>Tehran separately announce that it was cancelling the accreditation of one UN nuclear inspector.</p>
      <p>The suspension of uranium enrichment at the long-secret plant was one of the restrictions Iran had agreed to on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of UN sanctions.</p>
      <p>Iran's announcement on Wednesday that it would resume enrichment at the Fordow plant from midnight had drawn a chorus of concern from the remaining parties to the troubled agreement.</p>
      <p>Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia have been trying to salvage the hard-won deal since Washington abandoned it in May last year and re-imposed crippling unilateral sanctions.</p>
      <p>They say Iran's phased suspension of its obligations under the deal since May makes that more difficult.</p>
      <p>The resumption of enrichment at Fordow is Iran's fourth move away from the deal.</p>
      <p>Uranium enrichment is the process that produces fuel for nuclear power plants but could also, in highly extended form, produce the fissile material essential for a warhead.</p>
      <p>Iran has always denied any military dimension to its nuclear programme.</p>
