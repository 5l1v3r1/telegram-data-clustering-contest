There will be a pop-up virtual reality experience you can try, which will take thrill-seekers on an inner-city drone flight through and above the streets of Dubai. There’s also going to be a close look inside the capsule concept for the proposed Dubai to Abu Dhabi Hyperloop – the vacuumed tube capable of firing passenger pods at speeds of up to 1,080kmph. And with a host of other activities including Red Bull bike stunts, live drifting and more, it will be pedal to the metal.



Who’s going?Other than tens of thousands of visitors from the region, there will also be a handful of motoring celebrities visiting. F1 team owner and legend, Eddie Jordan, will be speaking on the 14th and the 15th and world stunt-driving champion Mike Jensen, regional champion Shadi Al Dhaheri and car park drift stunt driver Abdo Feghali are set to push the limits of what’s possible on two wheels in the dedicated drifting area. The first ladies-only supercar club, the Arabian Gazelles, will also be heading down and hosting a number of workshops, so don’t miss it.Anything else?With live music, plenty of grub, huge prizes, fun-filled experiences and loads of dedicated games and activations for mini petrolheads (they can even earn their license on the streets of KidZania), it’s a guaranteed experience-packed day out for all.
