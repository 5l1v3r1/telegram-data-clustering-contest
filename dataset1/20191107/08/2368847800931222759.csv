毛澤東策劃皖南事變內幕：害死項英 嫁禍蔣介石

07 Nov 2019, 08:53

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】1941年1月6日的「皖南事變」，一直被中共稱為是國民黨不打外戰，專打內戰的陰謀。然而，有學者披露「皖南事變」的真相是，毛澤東策劃了皖南事變，藉機幹掉自己的死對頭項英，並給蔣介石扣上發動內戰的大帽子，迫使國際社會給國民政府施壓，使中共得以苟延殘喘。
第二次國共合作期間，中共紅軍游擊隊接受國民政府改編成為新四軍，並接受蔣介石的國民政府最高軍事委員會統一指揮。然而，新四軍拿着國民黨軍餉，卻聽命於延安的毛澤東和中共。
新四軍自成立以來，就只圖發展和擴張，只打友軍，不打日軍，甚至拒絕聽從國民黨的命令。中共宣傳的所謂著名的韋崗戰役、黃橋戰役，即所謂的七戰七捷，以及西路戰役等，全部打的是內戰，打的是國民黨正在抗日的軍隊。
1940年7月17日，蔣介石正式發布命令，限新四軍軍部一個月全部撤到江北。中共在拖延了不少時日後，於1941年1月4日下令新四軍軍部及所屬的支隊9000多人由雲嶺出發北移。
在行至皖南涇縣茂林時，遭到國民黨軍8萬多人的伏擊，新四軍除2000人突圍外大部分被俘或陣亡。軍長葉挺與國民黨軍隊談判時被扣押，項英、周子昆被中共內部叛徒殺害。這次事件被稱為皖南事變。
英國籍華裔作家張戎在《毛澤東：鮮為人知的故事》一書中，披露了皖南事變的真相：皖南事變的主角之一新四軍政委項英，一直就是毛澤東的死對頭，二人有不解之仇。項英曾想制止毛用血腥暴力打AB團，毛則誣陷項英是AB團的後台。後來項英又反對毛「長征」，預見到毛要伺機奪權。項英對毛的態度一直是批評和嘲諷的，而毛則費盡心思想除掉項英。
項英的總部是新四軍唯一在長江以南的部隊，總部有1千工作人員、8千部隊，駐紮在雲嶺，黃山之側。毛澤東把新四軍90%的隊伍都已調到江北，組成了江北指揮部，由毛的盟友劉少奇負責，項英管轄的新四軍不到10%。
毛有意把項英的孤零零的總部送給蔣介石的部隊去殺戮，逼蔣介石開第一槍，促使斯大林同意打全面內戰。
1940年12月10日，蔣介石下令項英撤到江北，規定其走皖東路。因為鎮江一帶國民黨韓德勤部正在和新四軍開打，他不想項英部隊去參戰。
毛沒有向蔣表示異議，12月29日，他批准了這條路，對項英說：「同意直接移皖東、分批渡江。」
但是第二天，毛突然打電報要項英改走蔣介石特地否決的蘇南路線：「走蘇南為好。」這一路線改變，毛沒有通知蔣介石。
蔣介石還以為項英會按他的要求走皖東，於1941年1月3日發電報給新四軍軍長葉挺，重申皖東路線，並說他「沿途已令各（國民黨）軍掩護。」
項英發現蔣介石並不知道路線已改，趕緊在4日給蔣介石發了封電報通知他。但這封關鍵電報沒有送達蔣介石手裡，毛把電報壓下了。毛早已明令禁止中共將領直接跟蔣介石聯繫，所有的聯絡都必須經過他，再由周恩來轉。
張戎指出，毛澤東壓下項英1月4日關鍵電報的根據，是他在1月13日給重慶周恩來的電報。裡面說：「軍機前轉上葉、項支（4）日致蔣電，措詞不當，如未交請勿交。」這不僅說明毛不讓周轉項英的電報，而且說明毛是在13日或前一兩天才把項英4日的電報發給周恩來，這時國民軍隊對項英部隊的攻擊，已經在持續一星期後結束。
項英發完電報又等了若干小時，拖到當天夜裡才出發。他以為蔣介石應該得到改變路線的消息了，沿途駐紮的國民黨軍隊也應該接到命令，給他讓路了。
1月4日的夜晚，風雨交加，項英和一萬新四軍進入了國民黨十幾萬大軍的駐紮區。這些軍隊沒有得到項英要過路的通知，以為是新四軍來挑釁，就開了火。早已因黃橋之戰而痛恨新四軍的顧祝同，6日下令把項英的部隊「徹底加以肅清」。皖南事變爆發了。
1月6日到9日，國民黨軍隊圍殲項英部的最激烈的4天，慌張的項英發了一封又一封電報給延安，要毛向國民黨交涉停火，但是毛毫無動靜。到了9日，新四軍江北指揮部劉少奇電毛談起項英的情況，毛回電說他什麼情況也不知道。
毫無疑問，毛不想為新四軍解圍，毛要蔣介石殲滅他們。這樣莫斯科才可能批准他打全面內戰。同時，他也一箭雙鵰，除掉項英這個心腹之患。
在收到劉少奇1月9日發給毛的電報後，10日，新四軍總部報告毛：「支持四日夜之自衛戰鬥，今已瀕絕境，幹部全部均已準備犧牲。」「請以黨中央及恩來名義，速向蔣、顧交涉，以不惜全面破裂威脅，要顧撤圍，或可挽救。」然而，毛仍舊沒有動靜。
10日那天，項英親自給蔣介石打了封電報，懇求蔣撤圍。這封電報他再次發給毛轉，毛又再次把它壓了下來。毛對周恩來說，項英的這封電報比前一封「立場更壞」，「此電決不能交，故未轉你處。」
11日晚間，周恩來在重慶開酒會，慶祝《新華日報》3週年。毛關於新四軍總部被圍攻的電報這時姍姍來到，由周對慶祝會上的人宣布。但就是這份電報也不是叫周恩來向國民黨交涉停火，而只是泛泛的情況通報。
直到13日，周恩來才在毛的指令下向國民黨提出抗議，要求撤軍，而蔣介石已在前一天主動下令停止攻擊了。
也是在13日這一天，毛突然活躍起來，叫周恩來「向全國呼籲求援」。他命令部隊：「軍事上立即準備大舉反攻。」「已不是增兵威脅問題，而是如何推翻蔣介石統治問題。」「一下決心，就要打到四川去，打到底。」
毛知道他的軍隊遠不是國民黨的對手，沒有斯大林出兵相挺，他將一敗塗地。1月15日，周恩來去見蘇聯大使潘友新，說中共急需蘇聯的拯救。但潘潑了他一頭冷水。
潘在他的只給蘇聯高層看的回憶錄裡指出，他當時就懷疑皖南事變是毛澤東有意讓項英去送死，而周恩來在向他撒謊。
毛又繞過潘友新，直接向莫斯科呼籲懇求，要斯大林出兵幫他打全面內戰。但是莫斯科不相信毛的危言聳聽，也不相信蔣介石要「斬盡殺絕」中共。斯大林警告毛澤東「不要挑起破裂」。毛只好服從。
毛雖然沒能挑起全面內戰，但他的宿敵項英死了。項英在蔣介石下令停火後逃了出來，3月14日深夜，他在一個山洞裡睡覺時，被副官開槍打死。這名副官本來就對共產黨不滿，打死項英後，他拿走項英身上的金條財物，後來投向國民黨。
而毛澤東則給項英冠以種種罪名，把皖南事變說成是他「一貫機會主義領導的結果」，甚至影射項英是內奸：「此次失敗是否有內奸陰謀存在，尚待考查，但其中許多情節是令人懷疑的。」
直到今天，皖南事變的帳仍算在項英和蔣介石身上。蔣介石被毛澤東扣上打內戰的大帽子，受到國際社會施壓。皖南事變時，美國媒體報導，華盛頓打算把準備給中國的5千萬美金貸款壓下來，等中國不打內戰了再說。羅斯福對蔣介石表示，想要美國援助就不要打內戰，不管是誰發動的都不行。
英國也對蔣介石施壓，英國大使科爾（ClarkKerr）直言不諱地對蔣說，要是打起內戰來英國不會支持蔣，不管它是誰挑起的。
皖南事變後，莫斯科在西方組織了一場聲勢浩大的反蔣宣傳，稱蔣介石屠殺了一萬新四軍。實際數字是死亡兩千餘人。有三千新四軍成功歸隊，原因是他們掙脫包圍圈後，轉身走皖東路，渡過長江。而他們走的正是蔣介石指定的路，一路安全，沒人騷擾。
蔣介石並沒有給新四軍設陷阱，皖南事變後，蔣介石發表講話，指出此次不過是「整飭軍紀的問題」，「凡違令亂紀的軍人，在所必懲，至於稱兵作叛，襲擊友軍，侵佔防地，妨害抗戰的軍隊，更必然的須解散。這是抗戰治軍的天經地義……」
美國記者、著名小說家海明威在皖南事變後，對中共有一些深刻的觀察。他表示，中共「善於宣傳，使美國對他們在抗戰中起的作用，產生了名不副實的印象。其實中央政府軍隊的作用勝過他們一百倍。」
海明威還說，「根據我在西班牙（內戰裡）的經驗，共產黨總是拚命給人假象，只有他們在努力作戰。」
海明威對周恩來也看得很準：「共產黨的觀點是什麼他就賣什麼，而且賣得不錯。」
遺憾的是海明威的這些見解，直到20多年後的1965年才見天日。1941年，在羅斯福助理居裡的勸說下，海明威沒有把這些見解公之於世。居裡的理由是：「我們的政策是不要他們打內戰。」
迫於一系列國際上的壓力，皖南事變後，蔣介石讓新四軍繼續留在長江流域。

Mao Zedong planned the inside story of the Southern Anhui Incident: Killing Xiang Ying, blaming Chiang Kai-shek

07 Nov 2019, 08:53

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The ""Southern Anhui Incident"" on January 6, 1941 has been called by the CCP to be a conspiracy of the Kuomintang not to fight foreign wars and to fight civil war. However, some scholars have revealed that the truth about the ""Southern Anhui Incident"" is that Mao Zedong planned the Southern Anhui Incident, took the opportunity to kill his own rival, and gave Chiang Kai-shek a big hat to launch a civil war, forcing the international community to pressure the National Government to make the CCP It was able to survive.
During the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the CCP's Red Army guerrillas were reorganized by the National Government into the New Fourth Army and accepted the unified command of Chiang Kai-shek's National Government's Supreme Military Council. However, the New Fourth Army took the Kuomintang army, but took orders from Mao Zedong and the CCP in Yan'an.
Since its inception, the New Fourth Army has only developed and expanded. It only fights with friendly forces, does not fight Japanese troops, and even refuses to heed the orders of the Kuomintang. The so-called famous Weigang campaign and the Huangqiao campaign, the so-called seven wars and seven battles, and the West Road campaign, all played by the CCP, were all civil wars, and the Kuomintang was fighting against Japan.
On July 17, 1940, Chiang Kai-shek officially issued an order to limit the withdrawal of the New Fourth Army to Jiangbei. After a long delay, the CCP ordered on January 4, 1941, that more than 9,000 new military units and their respective detachments departed from Yunling.
When they went to Maolin in Weinan County, they were ambushed by more than 80,000 Kuomintang troops. Most of the New Fourth Army was captured or killed in addition to 2,000 people. When the military commander Ye Ting was detained during negotiations with the Kuomintang army, Xiang Ying and Zhou Zikun were killed by traitors inside the CCP. This incident was called the Southern Anhui Incident.
In the book ""Mao Zedong: Little-known Story"", the British-born Chinese writer Zhang Wei disclosed the truth about the Southern Anhui Incident: One of the protagonists of the Southern Anhui Incident, the New Fourth Army Political Commissar Xiang Ying, has always been Mao Zedong’s dead rival, and the two have puzzled hatred. Xiang Ying once wanted to stop the use of blood and violence to fight the AB group, Mao is the backstage of the AB group. Later, Xiang Ying also opposed the Mao ""Long March"" and foresees Mao to wait for opportunities to seize power. Xiang Ying’s attitude towards Mao has always been criticized and ridiculed, and Mao has tried his best to get rid of Xiang Ying.
Xiang Ying’s headquarters is the only force of the New Fourth Army south of the Yangtze River. It has 1,000 staff and 8,000 troops at its headquarters. It is stationed on the side of Yunling and Huangshan. Mao Zedong has transferred 90% of the New Fourth Army to Jiangbei, forming the Jiangbei Command, which is under the responsibility of Mao’s ally Liu Shaoqi, and the New Fourth Army under the jurisdiction of Xiang Ying is less than 10%.
Mao intends to give Xiang Ying’s solitary headquarters to Chiang Kai-shek’s troops to kill, and forced Chiang Kai-shek to open the first shot, prompting Stalin to agree to a full-scale civil war.
On December 10, 1940, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang Ying to withdraw to Jiangbei, stipulating that he would go east. Because the Kuomintang Han Deqin Department of Zhenjiang was playing with the New Fourth Army, he did not want Xiangying troops to go to war.
Mao did not object to Jiang. On December 29, he approved the road and said to Xiang Ying: ""Agree to move directly to the east and cross the river in batches.""
But the next day, Mao suddenly called the telegram to go to the southern Jiangsu route that Chiang Kai-shek specifically vetoed: ""Going to Sunan is good."" This route changed, Mao did not inform Chiang Kai-shek.
Chiang Kai-shek also thought that Xiang Yinghui would go to the east according to his request. On January 3, 1941, he reported to the new Fourth Army commander Ye Ting, reaffirming the Jidong route and saying that he ""had covered the Kuomintang troops along the way.""
Xiang Ying found that Chiang Kai-shek did not know that the route had been changed. He quickly sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek on the 4th to inform him. However, the key telegram was not delivered to Chiang Kai-shek’s hand, and Mao’s telegram was suppressed. Mao has already banned the CCP generals from directly contacting Chiang Kai-shek. All contacts must pass through him and then Zhou Enlai.
Zhang Wei pointed out that Mao Zedong’s basis for pressing the key telegram of Xiang Ying on January 4 was his telegram to Chongqing Zhou Enlai on January 13. It said: ""The military aircraft turned to the top, the branch (4) to the Chiang Kai-shek, the wording is not appropriate, if you have not paid, please do not pay."" This not only shows that Mao does not let the turn of the telegram, and that the hair is 13 On the day or a day or two before the Xiangying 4 telegram was sent to Zhou Enlai, the national army’s attack on Xiang Ying’s troops had ended one week later.
Xiang Ying’s telegram waited for a few more hours and was delayed until the night. He thought that Chiang Kai-shek should get news of changing the route. The Kuomintang troops stationed along the way should also receive orders to give way to him.
On the night of January 4, wind and rain, Xiang Ying and 10,000 new Fourth Army entered the stationed area of the KMT’s 100,000-strong army. These troops did not get a notice that Xiang Ying had to cross the road, thinking that it was the New Fourth Army to provoke and fire. Gu Zhutong, who had hated the New Fourth Army because of the Battle of Huang Qiao, ordered the ""King Ying"" troops to be ""completely eliminated"" on the 6th. The Southern Anhui Incident broke out.
From January 6th to 9th, the Kuomintang army encircled the most intense four days of the Xiangying Department. The panic of Xiang Ying sent a further telegram to Yan'an, asking Mao to negotiate a ceasefire with the Kuomintang, but Mao did not move. On the 9th, Liu Shaoqi, the commander of the New Fourth Army Jiangbei, talked about Xiang Ying’s situation. Mao said that he did not know what happened.
There is no doubt that Mao did not want to break the New Fourth Army. Mao wanted Chiang Kai-shek to annihilate them. This will allow Moscow to approve him to fight a full-scale civil war. At the same time, he also double-edged and removed the guilty heart of Xiang Ying.
After receiving the telegram sent by Liu Shaoqi to Mao on January 9, on the 10th, the headquarters of the New Fourth Army reported that Mao: ""Supporting the self-defense battle on the four-day night, the cadres are now desperate, and all the cadres are ready to sacrifice."" In the name of Enlai, speeding up to Jiang and Gu to negotiate, in order to avoid the threat of a complete rupture, to take care of the withdrawal, or to save."" However, Mao still has no movement.
On the 10th, Xiang Ying personally gave Chiang Kai-shek a telegram and begged Jiang to withdraw. The telegram sent him another hair, and Mao again pressed it down. Mao told Zhou En that the telegram of Xiang Ying was worse than the previous one. ""This power cannot be handed over, so it has not been transferred to you.""
On the evening of the 11th, Zhou Enlai opened a cocktail party in Chongqing to celebrate the 3rd anniversary of the Xinhua Daily. Mao’s telegram on the siege of the New Fourth Army headquarters came at this time and was announced by Zhou’s people at the celebration. But it is this telegram that is not called Zhou Enlai to negotiate a ceasefire with the Kuomintang, but only a general briefing.
Until the 13th, Zhou Enlai protested to the Kuomintang under the command of Mao, demanding the withdrawal of troops, and Chiang Kai-shek had taken the initiative to stop the attack the day before.
On the 13th, Mao suddenly became active and called Zhou Enlai to ""call for help from the whole country."" He ordered the troops: ""The military is ready to make a big counterattack immediately."" ""It is not a threat to increase the number of troops, but how to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's rule."" ""If you make up your mind, you must go to Sichuan and fight to the end.""
Mao knows that his army is far from the opponent of the Kuomintang. Without Stalin’s sentiment, he will be defeated. On January 15, Zhou Enlai went to see the Soviet ambassador Pan Youxin, saying that the CCP urgently needed the salvation of the Soviet Union. But Pan poured a cold water on him.
In his memoirs only for the Soviet high-level officials, Pan pointed out that he suspected that the Southern Anhui Incident was Mao Zedong’s intention to let Xiang Ying go to death, and Zhou Enlai was lying to him.
Mao also bypassed Pan Youxin and directly appealed to Moscow to ask for Stalin to send him to help him fight a full-scale civil war. However, Moscow does not believe in Mao’s alarmist voice and does not believe that Chiang Kai-shek wants to “kill the CCP”. Stalin warned Mao Zedong that ""do not provoke a breakdown."" Mao had to obey.
Although Mao failed to provoke a full-scale civil war, his old enemy Xiang Ying died. Xiang Ying escaped after Chiang Kai-shek ordered a ceasefire. On the night of March 14, when he slept in a cave, he was shot and killed by the adjutant. The adjutant was dissatisfied with the Communist Party. After killing Xiang Ying, he took away the gold bars and belongings of Xiang Ying and later voted for the Kuomintang.
Mao Zedong gave Xiang Yingguan all kinds of charges, and described the Southern Anhui Incident as ""the result of his consistent opportunistic leadership."" He even insinuated that Xiang Ying was a traitor: ""Is there a conspiracy of conspiracy in this failure, but it remains to be examined, but Many plots are doubtful.""
Until today, the accounts of the Southern Anhui Incident are still counted on Xiang Ying and Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek was detained by Mao Zedong as a big hat of civil war and was pressured by the international community. At the time of the Southern Anhui Incident, the US media reported that Washington intended to suppress the $50 million loan that was prepared for China, and wait for China not to fight civil war. Roosevelt told Chiang Kai-shek that if he wants US aid, he should not fight civil war, no matter who is launching it.
Britain also put pressure on Chiang Kai-shek. British ambassador Clark Kerr said bluntly to Chiang. If the civil war came, Britain would not support Chiang, no matter who it provoked.
After the Southern Anhui Incident, Moscow organized a massive anti-Chiang propaganda in the West, saying that Chiang Kai-shek slaughtered 10,000 new Fourth Army. The actual number is more than two thousand deaths. Three thousand new four troops successfully returned to the team because they broke away from the encirclement and turned to take the East Road and cross the Yangtze River. And they are taking the road designated by Chiang Kai-shek, all the way safe, no one is harassing.
Chiang Kai-shek did not set a trap for the New Fourth Army. After the Southern Anhui Incident, Chiang Kai-shek made a speech, pointing out that this was just a ""problem of rectifying the military discipline."" ""Where the soldiers who violated the chaos were punished, they would be rebellious and attacked the friendly forces. The army that invaded the land and hampered the war of resistance must be dissolved. This is the natural meaning of the war of resistance and the army...""
After the Southern Anhui Incident, the American journalist and famous novelist Hemingway had some profound observations on the Chinese Communist Party. He said that the CCP’s ""good advocacy"" has given the United States an impression of their role in the war of resistance. In fact, the role of the central government army is one hundred times better than that of them.""
Hemingway also said, ""According to my experience in Spain (the civil war), the Communist Party is always trying to give people the illusion that only they are fighting hard.""
Hemingway also saw Quenzilai very accurately: ""What is the Communist Party's point of view, what he sells, and sells well.""
Regrettably, Hemingway’s insights were not seen until 1965, more than 20 years later. In 1941, under the persuasion of Roosevelt's assistant Curie, Hemingway did not disclose these insights to the world. The reason for Curie is: ""Our policy is not to let them fight civil war.""
Under a series of international pressures, after the Southern Anhui Incident, Chiang Kai-shek allowed the New Fourth Army to remain in the Yangtze River.
