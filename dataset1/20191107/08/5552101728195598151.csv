高雄市一名國小人事主任，因為上月參加公民割草行動假日論壇，批評高雄市長韓國瑜，被教育局長要求寫3,000字心得報告。今（7日）高雄市議會民進黨和時代力量議員召開記者會，聲援這位主任，認為教育局長吳榕峯不適任，應該下台。
高雄市議員鄭孟洳、林于凱、林智鴻、高閔琳、黃文益等人今（7日）召開記者會，聲援因參加公民割草行動假日論壇，被教育局長要求寫3,000字心得報告的國小人事主任。
林于凱認為，公務員也是公民，在週末時應享有言論自由，不應強迫他寫3,000字報告；黃文益則舉起標語「順韓者昌、逆韓者亡」表達不滿；高閔琳說，這位國小主任覺得很無奈，在猶豫到底要不要寫心得報告。議員們也批評教育局長吳榕峯不適任，應該下台。
教育局長吳榕峯則強調，這位國小人事主任是教育人員，當然要用教育的方式讓他了解，所以請他閱讀第三屆第二次定期大會，共129頁的報告，讓他知道一整年教育局做了什麼事情，寫個心得報告作為懲處依據，「我覺得這個是一個教育手段」，但也表示主任可以拒絕這項要求。
