Nate Diaz has hinted he has retired from UFC.
Diaz, 34, suffered defeat to Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244 last weekend.
Diaz suffered two nasty cuts to the right side of his face - one above and one below the eye - in the early stages of his huge BMF title showdown, which was controversially stopped at the end of round three.
He has since been handed a 90 day medical suspension.
Since the defeat, there has been talk over a rematch between Diaz and Masvidal, while speculation over him facing Conor McGregor again has not gone away.

""F*** a rematch this s*** was over before it started. I’m goin on out on tour. Peace out fight game.""
Diaz is unable to contemplate a return to the octagon until February at the earliest and it now appears he has decided to walk away.
