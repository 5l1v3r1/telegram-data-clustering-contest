      <h1>Billy Joe Saunders falls for hustle ahead of appearance on KSI vs Logan Paul undercard</h1>
      <h2>Saunders will defend his super-middleweight world title against Marcelo Esteban Coceres on Saturday in Los Angeles</h2>

      <p>Jet-lagged Billy Joe Saunders sleepwalked dozily into an American hustle after landing in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The super-middleweight world champion arrived in California less than a week before the first defence of his title.</p>
      <p>He takes on the unknown Marcelo Esteban Coceres on Saturday looking to add legitimacy to the YouTube rematch between KSI and Logan Paul.</p>
      <p>But as a fighter renowned for his sharp mind in the ring, Saunders uncharacteristically let his guard down on the streets of Hollywood.</p>
      <p>“I was hustled out of $200,” he said. “Some kids came up to us selling candy and I felt sorry for them.</p>

      <p>“There were four of them, so I asked my mate to change some money up.</p>
      <p>“Then one of them says, ‘You want change? I've got change’, and pulls out a wad of notes, about $2,000, so I just thought, ‘F*** it, you had me’, and I gave it to them.</p>
      <p>“It's very different here, it’s my first time in LA and it’s a bit strange.”</p>
      <p>Saunders, 30, became a two-weight world champion in May when he outpointed Shefat Sufi at Stevenage’s football ground.</p>
      <p>Argentina’s Coceres brings an unbeaten record to the Staples Center but little else.</p>

      <p>And</p>
      <p>as Saunders targets fights with Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez next year, his toughest opponent this weekend may be exhaustion.</p>
      <p>“I'm walking around like a zombie, I'm nodding off to sleep but hopefully it will be different on fight night,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got the play the hand you’re dealt and there are no excuses from me, I'm here, I'm ready and I'm fit.</p>
      <p>“I've got to stay professional and get in the ring awake and hopefully get out awake.</p>
      <p>“All I can do is hopefully put on a masterclass.”</p>
