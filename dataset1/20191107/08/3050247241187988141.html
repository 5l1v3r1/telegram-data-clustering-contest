      <h1>Bitcoin Steady Around $9.2K as ‘Volatility Collapse’ Predicts Big Move</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:52:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) continued its downtrend on Nov. 7, barely keeping support above $9,200 as market commentators stay realistic about the future.</p>

      <h3>“Much bigger” BTC price move could come this week</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 shows BTC/USD down 1.6% on the day, circling $9,250 after a sudden dip saw markets bounce off $9,200.</p>
      <p>That level has been in play for the past 72 hours and has seen two tests since local highs of $9,520 on Monday. </p>
      <p>The week’s behavior continues a broader trend which Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-falls-below-9-200-after-rejection-by-9-500-resistance">reported on</a> previously — Bitcoin remains range-bound between $9,000 and $9,500.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now, commentators are considering the potential for a change in the pattern as volatility lessens. For Jim Wyckoff of gold outfit <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-11-06/Bitcoin-daily-chart-alert-Collapse-in-volatility-suggests-bigger-move-coming-Nov-6.html">Kitco</a>, that watershed could appear before the end of the week.</p>
      <p>“Recent price action has choppy, quiet and sideways. This ‘collapse in volatility’ suggests a much bigger price move is right over the horizon—maybe yet this week,” he summarized on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Wyckoff added that bulls held “slight overall near-term technical advantage,” giving strength to the possibility of a break to the upside.</p>
      <p>For regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to be in a similar position to 2016, just before markets began a breakout to all-time highs of $20,000.</p>
      <p>For him, Bitcoin hitting nearly $14,000 earlier this year followed by a consolidation period means that next in line is an uptick. This should happen by next May’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-most-dramatic-2020-halving-could-cut-supply-by-63m-a-week">block reward halving</a> and could take BTC/USD to $22,000.</p>
      <p>“Looks similar to 2016 still,” he told <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1191988453048832000">Twitter</a> followers on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins drip down amid lack of momentum</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile have seen a lackluster trading period over the past 24 hours, with most tokens losing several percentage points. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, lost $190 support after <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-price-breaks-key-resistance-can-it-repeat-bitcoins-42-gain">performing strongly</a> through the week. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Others fared worse, with Stellar (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stellar">XLM</a>) likewise reversing its gains to drop almost 8%. The exception was Tezos (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tezos">XTZ</a>), which gained 25% on the back of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-cryptocurrency-exchange-opens-tezos-staking-to-all-us-customers">staking deal</a> with exchange Coinbase.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap stands at $250 billion, with Bitcoin’s share equating to 66.8% of the total.</p>
