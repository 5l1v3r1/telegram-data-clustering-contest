追韓劇是寫小說的最新方法？　陳雪：我希望《無父之城》也能讓讀者廢寢忘食
07 Nov 2019, 08:48 by 鏡文學
由鏡文學企劃製作的《鏡文學耳朵K書吧》說書節目，每週二晚上9點在KKBOX「鏡文學頻道」直播，11/5的節目邀請到台灣的小說女王陳雪，她選擇跨出純文學的領域，首次嘗試用類型的方式寫小說，就選擇與鏡文學合作推出《無父之城》。她笑稱在不同領域發現了自己的新潛能，「都在《無父之城》一次爆發出來！」而喜歡看各種戲劇的陳雪，甚至點名邱澤、謝盈萱等多位帝后級演員來飾演《無父之城》，「溫昇豪就很適合演Seafood。這個角色就是臉上太光亮了，看不清楚。」
主持人陳栢青一開場即馬上告白自己從《惡女書》開始就是「叛逆女神」陳雪的頭號粉絲，還親眼見證了《無父之城》大排長龍的簽書會現場。雖然已是備受肯定的台灣中堅作家，追求新鮮的陳雪依然持續嘗試不同的寫作可能，從早餐文開始經營臉書，也寫自己的生活點滴，才發現寫散文對小說家來說「蠻療癒的」，在這個過程中陳雪也感受到自己有許多改變：「以前好像是嚴肅悲苦的純文學作家，現在更能釋放自己去和讀者互動，開發自己的不同面向」。這個過程「對小說家很滋補」，也讓她終於寫成彷彿島國縮影，圖像龐大的《無父之城》。

《無父之城》的故事發想其實早於《摩天大樓》，但這個自純文學轉到推理類型的嘗試，陳雪卻耗費了一番「苦功」。為了做功課，陳雪列了一個長長的追劇清單，甚至被業內人士譽為「製片級的專業片單」，「因為我希望大家讀我的小說，也可以廢寢忘食」。陳雪羅列最近在追的韓劇，除了歷史劇《我的王國》，也包含感情劇《我的大叔》、懸疑劇《信號》，「韓劇有很多寫實的地方，處理很多當代政治社會議題」，從追劇當中陳雪發現，不自覺地看下去的關鍵在於解謎。
《無父之城》講述背負著沉重過去的偵探陳紹剛，與失意的作家汪夢蘭相遇，一起捲進台灣中部小鎮的少女失蹤疑雲中，其中有政治、幫派、宗教狂熱，藉著這個海山鎮，具體而微了台灣的近當代社會現況。「我想寫關於摩天大樓、小鎮、小島的小說」，陳雪為了寫《無父之城》，讀了很多台灣近當代史，她發現台灣的歷史創傷，正可以作為這個龐大謎團的核心，一個集體創傷導致的後續現象可以持續50年，在小鎮裡變成一個漫長的故事。








小說裡還出現了一個台灣小說裡不曾出現的「Seafood」周老師。「我覺得每個台灣小鎮裡，都會有一個『師父』。」陳雪解釋無父之城的「父」代表父輩、國族，也可以代表信仰，當人失去核心，就會開始造神；而且師父身邊一定會有一個代言人，就是故事裡的龍小姐。「自從看了謝盈萱忽男忽女的表演，我就覺得龍小姐非她莫屬！」至於師父，陳雪則點名溫昇豪，「要有神性，臉太光亮了以至於看不清楚。」直播間連番爆出帝后級卡司陣容，眾人笑稱彷彿頒獎典禮現場！
《鏡文學耳朵K書吧》節目由鏡文學企劃製作，11月的《類型宇宙》由文壇人氣才子陳栢青主持，下集（11/12）來賓將訪問以《鬼島故事集》系列制霸恐怖文壇的作家飲馬人。每週二晚上9點在KKBOX「鏡文學頻道」直播，帶你探索各種不同類型的小說！

Is chasing Korean drama the latest way to write novels? Chen Xue: I hope that ""The City without Father"" can also make readers sleepless.
07 Nov 2019, 08:48 by Mirror Literature
The storytelling of ""Mirror Literature Ear K Book"" produced by the Mirror Literature Project was broadcast live on KKBOX ""Mirror Literature Channel"" at 9:00 pm every Tuesday. The 11/5 program invited Taiwanese novel Queen Chen Xue to choose to step out. In the field of pure literature, for the first time, I tried to write novels in a type of way, and I chose to cooperate with Mirror Literature to launch ""The City Without Fathers."" She laughed and said that she found her new potential in different fields. ""All of them broke out in ""The City without Father""!"" Chen Xue, who likes to watch various dramas, even named Qiu Ze, Xie Yingqi and many other emperors to play "" ""The City without a Father"", ""Wen Shenghao is very suitable for playing Seafood. This role is that the face is too bright, can't see clearly.""
The host, Chen Baiqing, immediately confessed that he had been the number one fan of Chen Xue, the ""rebellious goddess"" since the ""bad girl"", and witnessed the scene of the long queue of the ""Fatherless City"". Although he is already a well-recognized Taiwanese writer, the pursuit of fresh Chen Xue continues to try different writing possibilities. From the breakfast text, he started to run Facebook and wrote his own life, only to find that writing prose is quite good for novelists. In the process, Chen Xue also felt that he had many changes: ""It used to be a serious and sorrowful pure literary writer. Now he can release himself to interact with readers and develop his own different face."" This process ""is very nourishing for the novelist"", and she finally wrote it as a miniature of the island, a huge image of ""The City without a Father.""

The story of ""The City Without a Father"" was actually earlier than ""Skyscraper"", but Chen Xue has spent a lot of ""hard work"" on the attempt to transfer from pure literature to reasoning. In order to do his homework, Chen Xue listed a long list of follow-up dramas, and even was praised by the industry as a ""professional film-making professional film"". ""Because I hope that everyone can read my novels, I can also forget to eat and sleep."" Chen Xueluo’s recent Korean drama, in addition to the historical drama ""My Kingdom"", also includes the emotional drama ""My Uncle"" and the suspense drama ""Signal"". ""There are many realistic places in Korean dramas, dealing with many contemporary political and social issues."" In the pursuit of Chen Xue, the key to unconsciously watching is the puzzle.
""The City without a Father"" tells Chen Shaogang, a detective with a heavy past, and Wang Menglan, a frustrated writer, who is involved in the disappearance of a girl in the central town of Taiwan. Among them are politics, gangs, and religious fanaticism. Specifically, it has reduced the current situation of Taiwan’s contemporary society. ""I want to write novels about skyscrapers, towns, and small islands."" Chen Xue wrote a lot of Taiwan's recent and contemporary history in order to write ""The City Without Fathers."" She discovered that the historical trauma of Taiwan can be the core of this huge mystery. A follow-up phenomenon caused by a collective trauma can last for 50 years and become a long story in the town.








In the novel, there is also a ""Seafood"" teacher who did not appear in Taiwanese novels. ""I think there will be a ""master"" in every Taiwanese town."" Chen Xue explained that the ""father"" of the fatherless city represents the father and the nationality, and can also represent the faith. When the person loses the core, he will start to make God. And there must be a spokesperson around Master, the Miss Long in the story. ""Since I saw Xie Yingxi’s performance of a man and a woman, I think Miss Long is none other than her!"" As for Master, Chen Xue is named Wen Shenghao. ""If you have divinity, your face is so bright that you can't see clearly."" After a series of explosions, the post-election level of the Emperor’s lineup, everyone laughed and said that it was like the award ceremony!
The ""Mirror Literature Ear K Book"" program was produced by the mirror literature project. In November, ""Type Universe"" was hosted by Chen Baiqing, a popular literary talent. The next episode (11/12) guests will visit the ""Ghost Island Story Collection"" series to dominate the horror literary world. The writer is drinking horseman. Live at KKBOX ""Mirror Literature Channel"" every Tuesday at 9pm to explore different types of novels!
