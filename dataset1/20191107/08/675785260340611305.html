      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:32:07+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool Under-23s boss Neil Critchley is in line to take charge of the Carabao Cup quarter-final with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Reds are set to travel to Villa Park, just 24 hours before the Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp is yet to make a decision on who will take charge of the two teams, with logistics meaning he is unlikely to be in the dugout for both.</p>
      <p>Klopp is also likely to want to be with his players when they fly to Doha earlier in the week, before the FIFA competition.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7657637/Liverpool-23-boss-Neil-Critchley-line-charge-Carabao-Cup-quarter-final-tie.html">The Mail reports</a> Klopp's assistant Pep Lijnders is also a contender to take charge of the Villa tie, but Critchley may be a likelier option.</p>

      <p>Klopp is said to have complete confidence in the Under-23s boss, who will know the players involved first hand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are set to play a similar team to the one that beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the last round, with the likes of Rhian Brewster, Sepp van den Berg and Curtis Jones set to feature.</p>
      <p>First-team stars James Milner and Adam Lallana played in the previous round but will likely travel to Qatar, meaning the Reds will have to raid the Under-23 side to fill the squad at Villa.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the decision to play the game on December 17, Klopp said: "We asked Aston Villa if they would come to Qatar and we can play the game there!”</p>
      <p>“We have an idea how we do it, but it’s too early to speak about it. We made a decision because all the other alternatives were more problems than solutions, so we said ‘OK’.</p>
      <p>“This is how we can do it as good as possible for us. We have a bit of time to think about that, and more important things to do.</p>
      <p>“In these next couple of weeks we will make a decision about how it will look exactly. But in the end, they will play a Liverpool team, 100 per cent.”</p>
