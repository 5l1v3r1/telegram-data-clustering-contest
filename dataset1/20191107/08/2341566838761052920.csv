反送中效應 葛來儀：北京對台可能更強硬

（中央社記者徐薇婷華盛頓6日專電）香港「反送中」運動延燒數月，外界都在看中國最終會如何應對。美國學者葛來儀分析，若「一國兩制」證明在香港失敗，中國必將反思對台政策，未來可能採取更強硬作法及施以更大壓力。
美國戰略暨國際研究中心（CSIS）亞洲事務資深顧問葛來儀（Bonnie Glaser）在昨天播出的最新一集「中國國力」（China Power）播客節目中，與CSIS中國問題專家布蘭契特（Jude Blanchette）探討「反送中」運動對中國未來政策及台灣1月大選的影響。
葛來儀表示，中共已故領導人鄧小平在1979年提出「一國兩制」概念，他當時表示，若台灣回歸祖國懷抱，陸方將會「尊重台灣現實情況」。中國全國人大隨後在1982年通過內含特別行政區條款的新「憲法」，為「一國兩制」提供法律基礎。
葛來儀指出，時任中共總書記江澤民在1995年發表的俗稱「江八點」，也是在為「一國兩制」在台灣施行的願景，以及北京最終和平統一計畫奠定基礎。
在這背景下，葛來儀分析，香港「反送中」運動所帶來的長期衝擊，在中國的政策上會較為顯著。她表示，若「一國兩制」真的證明在香港失敗，中國必須自問「在台灣會可行嗎？」若中國認定，追求兩岸和平發展及最終和平統一的政策永遠行不通，北京則必須反思對台政策。
葛來儀說：「我的猜測是，在中國國家主席習近平統治之下，他們（中國）不會朝較溫和方向去，而會向更強硬方向發展。雖然這不必然代表會使用武力，但中國內部可能會有人這麼要求。」
葛來儀進一步分析，雖然習近平有許多問題要處理，像是美中貿易戰、中國經濟放緩及未來人口問題等，所以不太可能將台灣議題擺第一，但北京還是可能會好好反思未來對台政策。她強調，能確定的是，台灣可能面對更大外交、政治及軍事方面壓力。
關於「反送中」運動對台灣1月大選的影響，葛來儀表示，香港事件是影響總統蔡英文民調最重要的因素。她表示，蔡總統今年前5個月的民調數字，絕大部分都處於落後，但6月底開始卻完全翻盤，幾乎每份民調都領先國民黨總統候選人、高雄市長韓國瑜。
葛來儀指出，或許有些人主張，蔡總統民調上升與她過境美國或美國對台軍售有關，但她不認為台灣人有這麼注意相關新聞。相較之下，香港事件確實引起台灣人注意，也讓他們十分擔心，「若選出想與中國改善關係的總統，台灣可能面對不確定的未來」。1081107

Counter-delivery effect Ge Laiyi: Beijing may be tougher against Taiwan
07 Nov 2019, 08:23 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Xu Weiling, Washington, 6th) The Hong Kong ""reverse delivery"" campaign has been burning for several months, and the outside world is watching how China will eventually respond. American scholar Ge Laiyi analyzed that if ""one country, two systems"" proves to be a failure in Hong Kong, China will certainly reflect on its Taiwan policy and may adopt a tougher approach and exert greater pressure in the future.
Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser on Asian affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in the latest episode of China Power's podcast on yesterday, and CSIS China expert Blanchett ( Jude Blanchette) explores the impact of the ""Reverse Sending"" campaign on China's future policy and Taiwan's January general election.
Ge Laiyi said that the late leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping, proposed the concept of ""one country, two systems"" in 1979. He said that if Taiwan returns to the embrace of the motherland, the mainland will ""respect the reality of Taiwan."" The National People's Congress of China subsequently passed a new ""constitution"" containing the provisions of the Special Administrative Region in 1982, providing a legal basis for ""one country, two systems.""
Ge Laiyi pointed out that the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin published in 1995, known as ""Jiang Bian"", is also laying the foundation for the ""One Country, Two Systems"" vision in Taiwan and the final peace plan of Beijing.
Against this background, Ge Laiyi analyzed that the long-term impact of the ""reverse delivery"" movement in Hong Kong will be more pronounced in China's policies. She said that if ""one country, two systems"" really proves to be a failure in Hong Kong, China must ask itself ""Will it be feasible in Taiwan?"" If China determines that the policy of pursuing cross-strait peace development and eventual peaceful reunification will never work, Beijing must reflect on Taiwan policy. .
Ge Laiyi said: ""My guess is that under the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping, they (China) will not go in a more moderate direction, but will develop in a more tough direction. Although this does not necessarily mean the use of force, but it does not necessarily mean the use of force, but There may be people in China who ask for it.""
Ge Laiyi further analyzed that although Xi Jinping has many problems to deal with, such as the US-China trade war, China's economic slowdown and future population problems, it is unlikely to put the Taiwan issue first, but Beijing may still reflect on the future. Taiwan policy. She stressed that what is certain is that Taiwan may face greater diplomatic, political and military pressures.
Regarding the impact of the ""reverse delivery"" campaign on Taiwan's January general election, Ge Laiyi said that the Hong Kong incident was the most important factor affecting the president's Tsai Ing-wen. She said that most of the polling figures of President Cai’s first five months of this year were behind, but they started to completely reverse at the end of June. Almost every poll was ahead of the KMT’s presidential candidate and Kaohsiung Mayor.
Ge Laiyi pointed out that some people may argue that the rise of President Cai’s poll is related to her transit to the United States or the United States to arms sales to Taiwan, but she does not believe that Taiwanese have such attention to relevant news. In contrast, the events in Hong Kong have indeed caught the attention of Taiwanese and they are very worried. ""If you choose a president who wants to improve relations with China, Taiwan may face an uncertain future."" 1081107
