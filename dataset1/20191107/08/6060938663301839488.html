      <p>DHAKA: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mominul-Haque">Mominul Haque</a> says he was stunned to be named Bangladesh Test captain in place of the banned <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shakib-Al-Hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a> but is relishing the chance to take on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>'s side in India.</p>
      <p>Shakib was banned last week by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Cricket-Council">International Cricket Council</a> for two years, one of them suspended, for failing to declare attempts to bribe him.</p>
      <p>Such is the fame of 32-year-old superstar Shakib that around 700 people took to the streets of his hometown in protest, with the prime minister expressing her anguish at the punishment.</p>
      <p>Haque, 28, who has never led a top team in domestic cricket, told reporters ahead of the first Test in India next week that he was surprised to get the role.</p>
      <p>"I was not ready at all. It was completely unexpected. I never thought even in my dreams that I will be the captain of Bangladesh or I will captain the Test side," he said late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh's first two-Test series in India begins November 14 in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indore">Indore</a> and ends with the inaugural day-night Test between the sides in Kolkata from November 22.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited as I think (Kohli) is the best player in the world, the best batsman in all formats combined. Thinking about that makes me feel good," Mominul said.</p>
      <p>Mominul has played 36 Tests and scored 2,613 runs and has the highest average among his country's batsmen at 41.47.</p>
      <p>"We have not played a Test under the floodlights and with the pink ball. It is a very good chance to play good cricket," the left-hander said while insisting the captaincy would not affect his game.</p>
      <p>"I never considered captaincy as pressure or responsibility. If I keep thinking that as a captain I have to take extra responsibility to carry the team forward then I will be in some pressure," he said.</p>
      <p>"But if I play my natural game, and think that I am a batsman who needs to score for his team, then it will not have any effect," he added.</p>
      <p>Mominul is not part of the Twenty20 squad in India, led by experienced batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a> Riyad, who are 1-0 up in a three-match series after winning the opener by seven wickets in New Delhi. The second match is in Rajkot later Thursday.</p>
