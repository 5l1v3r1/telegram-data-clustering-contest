【雙11開戰】同行非冤家　全國電子攜手良興電子聯手進攻電商
07 Nov 2019, 08:30 by 柯長錕, 吳貞慧
搶在雙11購物節前夕，籌備一年多，全國電子今（7日）宣布攜手同業良興電子，正式進軍線上購物，打破同業相斥的競爭態勢，在業界相當罕見。全國電子總經理林政勳自信滿滿地說，「要成為最有溫度的電商平台。」預計雙11 檔期帶動1成以上業績成長，並希望每年朝雙位數成長邁進。
「我知道我們做電商比別人起步慢，但有40多年通路經驗、300多家實體門市，有信心可以做得更好。」今日，在全國電子線上購物開站記者會上，總經理林政勳向媒體細數自家的競爭優勢。
全國電子線上購物從8月以來已經試營運三個月，業績表現比預期好，林政勳開心地透露，「8月上線單月業績破千萬元。」刻意選在雙11大檔前正式上線，要與PChome、momo、燦坤等勁敵互別苗頭。
外界好奇全國電子為何要選擇與同業良興電子合作，「不是收購也沒有持股交換，單純就是合作。」林政勳急忙撇清媒體連珠炮的質疑。
良興電子總經理賴志達補充，「台灣3C家電生態系非常競爭，良興電子和全國電子都是40多年的，我們優勢是資通訊產品，全國則是家電，面對未來市場變化，同行不是冤家，異業可以良師。」在線上購物的營運分工，全國電子委託良興電子負責電商平台系統建置、金流和物流，預估省下千萬元的建置成本，未來全國電子負責大家電、而良興電子則以資通訊產品為主，兩者達到互補。
談到敏感的業收拆分，賴志達透露，「會有分潤。」但簽約時間、詳細拆分方式則低調不願意透露。


全國電子線上購物選在雙11購物節前上線，搶攻年度電商最大檔大餅。

面對既有電商，全國電子線上購物優勢和差異化在哪？林政勳信心滿滿地說，「我們要做最有溫度的電商，優勢會在大家電部分，消費者線上下訂後，會由就近門市的服務人員致電聯繫安裝，以及後續服務事宜。」不同於既有電商只負責銷售，全國電子將線上服務延伸到線下門市，主打一站式的服務讓消費者有感。
明（8日）起至12日線上線下將同步展開為期五天的「破盤11.11」活動，包括全館指定家電9折、指定電腦/螢幕現折2,222元、刷指定銀行信用卡最高回饋3,600(需分期及登錄)，也都將推出限定瘋搶3C家電商品，消費滿499元免運費。
