And Holloway has been blown away by Bilic's impact at the Baggies and reckons they are a good bet for promotion, adding that any side that does finish near West Brom will be close to a place in the Premier League.
""I had the pleasure of meeting Slaven Bilic last week,"" He wrote in his column for the Mirror .
""Woah what a fella! I was absolutely captivated in his company. It was marvellous.
""Would I bet against West Brom getting promoted? I don't think I would. Anyone who finishes either one place above them or one place below is going to be very close to being promoted.
 
""They are going to be in that shake-up and I think they are going to be one of the two to go up.
""I think that is all down to the manager. He filled me with confidence and I don't even play for him.
""When I sat with him and listened to him it was fantastic. He is the secret behind the solidness they seem to have.""
