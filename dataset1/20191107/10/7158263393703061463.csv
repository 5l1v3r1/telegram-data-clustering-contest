Okay, so you’ve booked your long-overdue girls’ trip, but it includes a 10-hour flight or an extensive road trip. Boo! While it would be nice to simply snap your fingers and be in Hawaii, scientists haven’t quite figured that one out yet. So until they crack the space-time continuum, you’re stuck in a cramped, freezing plane next to that one person who puts their bare feet on the seat in front of them (you know the one). The process of getting to your destination might not be fun, but with all the right travel accessories, the trip will be way less stressful. Be prepared with these 28 essentials, from compression socks to dry shampoo, and the next time you travel anywhere, it’ll be a breeze.
