      <p>Arsene Wenger maintains he is not in discussions with Bayern Munich about their managerial vacancy – but would “never refuse” to talk to the Germans.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old former Arsenal boss is reported to be high on Bayern’s wanted list as they look for a replacement for Niko Kovac, who was sacked following the 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga club are said to be looking at a deal to bring the Frenchman to the Allianz Arena until the end of the season, with former Juventus boss Max Allegri another name in the frame.</p>

      <p>Wenger, who had been close to joining the Germans earlier in his coaching career, has been working as a pundit for beIN SPORTS.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal boss was in the studio to help analyse Bayern Munich’s Champions League win over Olympiakos on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Asked about the reports he was now willing to talk to the German giants, Wenger said: “I never refuse to talk to Bayern Munich because I know these people who lead the club for 30 years.</p>
      <p>“I was nearly going to Bayern a long, long time ago. At the moment, that is all I can say.</p>

      <p>“At the moment, I haven’t talked to them at all.</p>
      <p>“We have not talked to each other and I don’t know (if we will).”</p>
      <p>The veteran Frenchman has been out of football since leaving the Gunners during May 2018 after 22 years with the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>Wenger is also considering a job offer from FIFA, but any such role would not prevent him from completing a return to management.</p>

      <p>“I have not decided yet if I will go back on the pitch or not,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am quite happy at what I do. I miss the pitch as well, so it is a difficult decision for me at the moment.</p>
      <p>“I will make that decision in the coming days or the coming week.”</p>
      <p>Pressed if he would be open to an approach from Bayern, Wenger replied: “I always talk – in fact I talk a lot here, I wonder why!”</p>
