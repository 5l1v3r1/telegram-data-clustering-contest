藍絲黃絲
07 Nov 2019, 10:06 by Lo's Psychology


我們想讓你知道的是藍黃之爭在心理學上可以用很多知識解釋，而現在的香港是高度政治化的：政治化沒有甚麼不好，作為優秀的香港公民，應該積極參與政治，為社會作出貢獻。



相信大家昨天（編按：11月5日）都有留意杜汶澤和陳百祥「阿叻」在香港電台節目中的舌戰，其實他們的「辯論」並沒有太多讓人討論的價值，迴響這麼大只是由於他們是名人而已，在本質上，他們的辨論和平日發生在我們身邊的並沒有甚麼不同，是黃絲和藍絲之間的日常對話。黃絲藍絲是香港在社會運動下顯露出來的兩種社會群體，擁有截然不一樣的價值觀和政治理念。
在逃犯條例發展至今已經差不多5個月，黃絲和藍絲之間的爭鬥無日無之，社會之撕裂已蔓延至生活各個領域上，和「佔中」時流於語言及肢體暴力的層面不一樣，「反修例」運動的黃藍之爭在經濟層面上也可以看到。我們排隊「懲罰」黃店，罷食罷買藍店就是例子。所以現在社會是高度政治化的，政治化沒有甚麼不好，作為優秀的香港公民，應該積極參與政治，為社會作出貢獻。從自己開始，從生活開始，從小事開始參與政治我相信對每個人來說並不困難。
藍黃之爭的出現在心理學上可以用很多知識去解釋。例如確認偏誤（confirmation bias）：人類只喜歡接收和自己意見一致的資訊，令到黃絲只看黃絲資訊，藍絲只看藍絲資訊，不斷接收和自己意見一致的資訊會不斷強化自己的理念，令黃絲變成「深黃」、藍絲變成「深藍」，這種越走越極端的社會心理學現象稱為群體極化（group polarization），令本來中立的一群開始選擇歸邊。整個社會於是被完全撕裂成兩個陣營。
除了以上那些心理學理論外，隨著運動不斷深化，我發現了一個很奇特的現象。在我們常常覺得示威者捨身成仁是正義化身、警察是所有事端的始作俑者的同時，藍絲和撐警人士和我們有相同的思想，只不過是反過來：他們覺得警察維持治安保護香港也是正義之師的化身，而示威者才是亂局的源頭。兩邊陣營都覺得自己是正義的一方，敵方則是魔鬼。這讓我想起一個社會心理學理論，鏡象感知（mirror image perception）。這個心理學概念形容在衝突過程中（現在的香港正正在衝突的中心），己方和敵方都會將自己的行為判斷為正確、將對方的行為判斷為錯誤。
以上的心理學知識告訴了我們一些人類的行為和思想天性，我們傾向接收和自己思想一致的聲音和資訊；確認偏誤讓我們黃的越黃、藍的越藍，讓社會越來越撕裂；在衝突下鏡像感知則讓黃藍兩派都懷著自己做的事是正確的思想狀態，讓藍黃融合幾乎成為不可能的事。
我們今天學了很多心理學知識去簡單理解「黃藍之爭」，我們都知道這些是人類本質，但我們不應將「人類本質」去合理化所有不公義的事情，例如我們不應將所謂的「路西法效應」合理化警察的暴力，在大是大非前，真理永遠只有一個。
最後，其實我們真的不需要將專注力放於「叻哥」身上，我們還有更多更重要的事要關注要做。藍絲有很多種，「叻哥」這種算是最低級的。

Blue silk yellow wire
07 Nov 2019, 10:06 by Lo's Psychology


What we want you to know is that the blue-and-yellow dispute can be explained in psychology with a lot of knowledge. Now Hong Kong is highly politicized: there is nothing wrong with politicization. As a good Hong Kong citizen, you should actively participate in politics. Society contributes.



I believe that everyone yesterday (Editor's Note: November 5) has paid attention to the war between Du Wenze and Chen Baixiang's ""Auntie"" on Radio Television Hong Kong. In fact, their ""debate"" does not have much value for discussion. The response is so big. Because they are celebrities, in essence, their argument that Peace Day happens to us is no different, is the daily dialogue between Huang Si and Lan Si. Yellow silk is the two social groups that Hong Kong has revealed under the social movement. It has very different values and political ideas.
It has been almost five months since the development of the fugitive offenders regulations. The battle between Huang Si and Lan Si has been in vain. The tears of society have spread to all areas of life, and the level of language and physical violence in the ""occupation of China"". Not the same, the yellow-blue battle of the ""anti-revision"" movement can also be seen on the economic level. We are lining up to ""punish"" the Huangdian, and taking the strike to buy a blue store is an example. Therefore, the society is highly politicized now. There is nothing wrong with politicization. As a good Hong Kong citizen, we should actively participate in politics and contribute to society. Starting from myself, starting from life, starting to participate in politics from a small matter, I believe that it is not difficult for everyone.
The emergence of the blue-and-yellow battle can be explained in psychology with a lot of knowledge. For example, confirmation bias: humans only like to receive information that is consistent with their own opinions, so that Huangsi only looks at the yellow silk information, blue silk only sees the blue silk information, and constantly receives information that is consistent with their own opinions will continue to strengthen themselves. The idea of turning yellow silk into ""dark yellow"" and blue silk into ""dark blue"", this more and more extreme social psychological phenomenon called group polarization, made the group that was originally neutral begin to choose to return. The whole society was then completely torn into two camps.
In addition to the above psychological theories, as the movement deepened, I discovered a very strange phenomenon. At the same time that we often feel that the demonstrators are the embodiment of justice and the police are the initiators of all the incidents, Lansi and the police supporters have the same thoughts, but the other way around: they feel that the police maintain law and order and protect Hong Kong is also justice. The incarnation of the teacher, and the demonstrators are the source of the chaos. Both camps feel that they are the right side of the camp, and the enemy is the devil. This reminds me of a social psychology theory, mirror image perception. This psychological concept is described in the process of conflict (now Hong Kong is at the center of the conflict), both the enemy and the enemy will judge their actions as correct and judge each other's behavior as wrong.
The above psychological knowledge tells us about some human behaviors and thoughts. We tend to receive sounds and information that are consistent with our own thoughts. Confirming the bias makes us yellower, bluer and bluer, let the society tear more and more. Under the conflict, the mirror perception makes the yellow and blue parties carry the things they do is the correct state of mind, making the integration of blue and yellow almost impossible.
We have learned a lot of psychological knowledge today to understand the ""blue-blue battle"". We all know that these are human natures, but we should not rationalize the ""human nature"" of all injustices. For example, we should not call the so-called The ""Lucifer effect"" rationalizes the violence of the police. Before the big and the big, there is only one truth.
In the end, in fact, we really don't need to focus on ""Geng Ge"". We have more and more important things to pay attention to. There are many kinds of blue silk, and this is the lowest level.
