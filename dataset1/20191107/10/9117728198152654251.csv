Kimi Raikkonen's phenomenal start to US GP: Five places gained!
07 Nov 2019, 10:45 by Matt Gretton

In his own words, he ""could just as well have been the last"" in Austin. Kimi Raikkonen finished eleventh in the Grand Prix of the United States and therefore again did not score points. The racing skills of the Iceman certainly did not depend on it: At the start of the race, the Finn raced extremely skillfully past five competitors, to ride P11 again at the end of lap one. Not a bad start from P17!
