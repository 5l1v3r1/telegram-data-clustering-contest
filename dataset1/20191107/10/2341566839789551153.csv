07 Nov 2019, 10:42 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者汪淑芬台北7日電）星宇航空預定明年一月開航，目前正準備最後考試，今天是第2次緊急逃生演練，預計下週接受交通部民航局50小時國內外驗證飛行，這也是星宇航空營運前最重要的關卡。
星宇航空首架A321neo飛機10月28日已回到台灣，民航局依規定檢視星宇航空營運前必需具備的條件，先前已做了一次機組員緊急逃生演練，昨天舉行空地勤口試，今天再進行第2次機組員緊急逃生演練。
根據民航局的規定，如果星宇航空第2次逃生演練過關，預計下週就可開始國內外50小時的驗證飛行，其中必須含10小時夜間飛行，由民航局考官登上飛機，對星宇航空已完訓的機師出考題，實際檢測星宇航空機師，在面臨飛行中的各種情況下，是否能通過考驗。
至於國外的驗證飛行，主要是星宇航空未來預計飛行的航點。
星宇航空先前已公布明年1月23日首航，初期先飛東南亞，規劃明年下半年飛東北亞，首航當天同時開航澳門、越南峴港及馬來西亞檳城。
民航局說，因A321neo是台灣首次引進的機型，星宇航空開航前，除了驗證飛行外，首航的3個航點，民航局都會派人在星宇航空飛機上，做實際航路、航點檢視。
依照民航局的檢測進度，如果星宇航空的驗證飛行一切順利，預計11月底或12月初可完成，之後再由交通部核發「民用航空運輸業許可證」，星宇航空就可售票營運。
根據星宇航空先前說法，希望最快12月中可以售票。（編輯：方沛清）1081107
