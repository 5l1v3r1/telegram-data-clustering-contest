      <p>The victims of an attempted murder bid in Greenock are in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>Karen Branwhite, 37, and Finlay McIntyre, 52, were repeatedly knifed yesterday in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/bloodbath-horror-greenock-murder-bid-20828682">“horrendous and horrific” targeted attack</a>.</p>
      <p>Police said they were following a positive line of inquiry as they hunted the two attackers who carried out the stabbings at about 8.45pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector David Wagstaff, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock">Greenock</a> CID, described the latest attack as “horrendous and horrific”.</p>

      <p>He said: “This is a despicable, targeted attack on two people. They sustained knife injuries to their bodies.”</p>
      <p>He said the victims were both being treated in a high dependency unit in Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and their condition was “critical but stable”.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the street was sealed off as police gathered evidence.</p>
      <p>A resident, who did not want to be named, said: “This place is getting wild.</p>
      <p>“I saw loads of police and the road was totally blocked off for a while. Later on, maintenance men were in cleaning the steps and outside stairs.</p>
      <p>“It must have been like a bloodbath.”</p>

      <p>Police are asking anyone with information on what happened to get in touch.</p>
      <p>Wagstaff said: “The suspects arrived in a silver-coloured taxi and left in the same taxi.</p>
      <p>“They then got out of the taxi in Kilmacolm Road, near to Blairmore Road. They were last spotted walking along Kilmacolm Road, going in the direction of Burnhead Street.”</p>
      <p>Both suspects were wearing dark clothing and one had a baseball cap on.</p>
