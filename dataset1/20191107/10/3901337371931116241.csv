Ramsey scored his first Champions League goal for Juve during the club's 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow when he poked home Ronaldo's free-kick, despite it looking like the ball would have crossed the line anyway.
The former Arsenal star immediately acknowledged that he had stolen his teammate's goal and, in a video that has circulated on social media, could be seen mouthing ""that's your goal"" to a smiling Ronaldo.



Ramsey also revealed that he apologised to the former Real Madrid star, and explained his reasoning for putting the ball in the back of the net.
""I thought the keeper was a lot closer to me and had a chance of diving back and maybe clearing it,"" Ramsey said after the match, as reported by IBTimes.
""My instinct took over to make sure that it went over the line. I've apologised to Cristiano.""
