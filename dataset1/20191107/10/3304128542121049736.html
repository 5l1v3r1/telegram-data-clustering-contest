      <p>Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale took to his heels a few minutes after showing up in Kibra’s Laini Saba. He was trying to make his way to YMCA Polling Station.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the former lawmaker had turned up to show support for Jubilee candidate and flag bearer in Kibra by-elections McDonald Mariga.</p>

      <p>Khalwale has been one of the most vocal supporters of McDonald Mariga, appearing in every press conference and rallies.</p>
      <p>He changed his political stance and is now a staunch supporter of Deputy President William Ruto, from ODM’s Raila Odinga, with the pledge to deliver Western Kenya votes to jubilee come 2022 General Elections.</p>
      <p>The Kibra race has been viewed as a supremacy contest between Odinga and DP Ruto.</p>
      <p>Kibra has been viewed as Odinga’s ‘bedroom’ with Ruto labelled the visitor who has invaded it.</p>

      <p>The by-election that has kicked on earlier today, November 7, will determine the outcome in the upcoming 2022 general elections, where Ruto is aiming the top seat.</p>
      <p>This is after the death of Ken Okoth, who succumbed to cancer after a long time battle a few months ago.</p>
      <p>The hotly contested seat has attracted 24 candidates, with five wards – Makina, Laini Saba, Sarang’ombe, Woodley/Kenyatta Golf Course and Lindi with 118,658 votes.</p>
