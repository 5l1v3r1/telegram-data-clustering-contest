      <h2>Chris Kamara and Chris Moyles were trying to fool fans of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! into thinking the football pundit would appear in the jungle this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:02:11+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Football pundit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-kamara">Chris Kamara</a> has confessed he set up an elaborate prank to try and fool fans into thinking he was joining <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity </a> this year.</p>
      <p>The ex-footballer, 61, sparked rumours he was joining the jungle when he was spotted filming in front of a green screen clad in jungle attire.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online debunked the stunt, confirming he was not <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">on the list</a> for the jungle show</p>
      <p>Now Radio X presenter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-moyles">Chris Moyles</a> told listeners of his show yesterday that it was just a joke - and even Kamara's own kids were fooled.</p>
      <p>Kammy said: "My own son asked, 'What's going on dad?'"</p>
      <p>When he was asked by Moyles if he'll be on the show, he replied: "Definitely not.</p>
      <p>"I've got a Christmas album to promote."</p>

      <p>An ITV source previously told Mirror Online: "He's not on the list of contestants so it's likely he was filming something unrelated."</p>
      <p>It's unlikely Chris would ever have been considered for a spot as ITV bosses are said to have already signed up two sports stars - rugby ace James Haskell and ex-footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb returns to TV on November 17 and fans can expect a stellar line-up.</p>

      <p>Rumoured camp mates currently include US sports star-turned-reality TV regular Caitlyn Jenner and former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>Also said to be in the mix is ex-EastEnders actress Jaqueline Jossa and telly star Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>X Factor's Myles Stephenson, Corrie's Andrew Whyment and radio presenter Roman Kemp are all believed to be dusting off their hiking boots and jungle hats.</p>

      <p>This year's series will see the return of Ant McPartlin, who took last year off to deal with his personal problems in the aftermath of his drink-driving conviction.</p>
      <p>He was replaced by Holly Willoughby, who has stood aside to allow Ant to retake his place alongside presenting partner Declan Donnelly.</p>
