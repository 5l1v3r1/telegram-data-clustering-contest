The association of the two brands surely took many by surprise, although luxury and activewear have increasingly crossed paths. Adidas last month unveiled a new unique digital store in London which will launch exclusive products, including a collaboration with artist Lucy Bryant, and has a history of partnerships with designers and artists ranging from Stella McCartney, Raf Simons and Rick Owens to Pharrell Williams.
