      <p>Collins Dictionary has recognised the word “non-binary”, whilst also naming “climate strike” as its Word of the Year 2019.</p>
      <p>The additions mark a year in which Sam Smith came out as non-binary and 16-year-old Greta Thunberg launched a global environmental movement.</p>
      <p>The dictionary said it added the term “non-binary” in recognition of “changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves”.</p>
      <p>A person who identifies as non-binary does not define themselves exclusively as masculine or feminine‍ and generally prefers they/them pronouns, rather than he/she.</p>

      <p>Collins defines non-binary, which can also be spelled nonbinary, as “relating to a gender or sexual identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female, heterosexual or homosexual”.</p>
      <p>Pop star Smith came out as non-binary this year, sparking a debate over gender and sexuality, and was among the first celebrities to ask the public to refer to them using they/them pronouns.</p>
      <p>Other stars who identify as non-binary include Me Too campaigner Rose McGowan, Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness, drag queen Courtney Act and musician Grimes.</p>
      <p>Miley Cyrus and Cara Delevingne, however, identify as genderfluid, which differs from non-binary in that the person does not identify as having a fixed gender.</p>

      <p>LGBT charity Stonewall’s director of campaigns Laura Russell hailed the move to recognise the term.</p>
      <p>She told the PA news agency: “It’s great that Collins will officially be adding non-binary to their dictionary.</p>
      <p>“Non-binary people have always existed in every community, so it’s important more organisations and people use language that includes everyone and recognises who they are.”</p>
      <p>In a similar move, Collins has recognised the term bopo, short for body positivity, a movement which advocates people being proud of their bodies whatever their shape or size.</p>

      <p>Climate strikes are part of a snowballing movement sparked by Thunberg’s school strikes outside the Swedish parliament.</p>
      <p>The term was first registered by Collins’ lexicographers in November 2015 when the first event of its kind took place during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris.</p>
      <p>The term was used on average 100 times more in 2019 than the previous year.</p>
      <p>Alongside “climate strike”, Collins has also added the term “rewilding”, the practice of returning land to a wild state.</p>
      <p>A slate of recent political terms have also been recognised.</p>
      <p>“Double down” describes those who “refuse to give ground” rather than concede a mistake, while cancelled is defined as “publicly ceasing to acknowledge a person, organisation, etc, esp on social media, in order to express disapproval of their activities or opinions”.</p>
      <p>The term “influencer”, the TV genre of “hopepunk” and the digital imaging technique of “deepfakes” also feature.</p>
      <p>All the words of the year can be found on CollinsDictionary.com, and will be considered for future print editions.</p>
