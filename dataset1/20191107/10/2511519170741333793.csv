Everton midfielder Andre Gomes has issued a thank you message to supporters and well-wishers, after leaving hospital this week.
The Portuguese international suffered a fracture dislocation of the ankle after a tackle from Tottenham‘s Son Heung-min in the Premier League match at the weekend and underwent surgery on Monday.
On Tuesday, the Merseyside club confirmed that the midfielder had been discharged and was headed home, before Gomes himself released a video on Twitter to thank fans for their support.
“Hi everyone. As you already know everything went well,” he began.
“I’m already at home with my family and I’d like to thank you all for the support, the messages and the positive energy. Thank you.”
No timeframe has been put on Gomes’ recovery by Everton, though it is unlikely he’ll play a meaningful role, if anything, this season.
On Wednesday, Son once more apologised for his part in the injury, telling BT Sport how he remained sorry and had to focus for the good of the team.
Son scored twice in Spurs’ 4-0 win over Red Star Belgrade.
