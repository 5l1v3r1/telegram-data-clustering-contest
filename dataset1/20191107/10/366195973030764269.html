      <p>You've all heard her viral hit "Mooo!" but since then, Doja Cat has seriously been establishing herself as one of the most prominent forces in hip-hop. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/doja-cat-delivers-sophomore-effort-hot-pink-ft-tyga-gucci-mane-and-smino-new-mixtape.119749.html">The versatile singer/songwriter/rapper from Los Angeles released her sophomore album <i>Hot Pink</i> today and, after giving it a full listen, you'll realize what she's all about</a>. Throughout the project, her sex appeal is made extremely clear and on tracks like "Cyber Sex," which actually opens up the album, we get a sense that Doja Cat is just one of the freakiest artists out there.</p>
      <p>Following her performance on the main stage at the Day N Vegas festival, Doja Cat has dropped the official video for "Cyber Sex" and it's exactly what you would imagine from her. The creative songstress crafts a futuristic wonderland, filled with fantasy, lust and elements of pornography. The star transforms into a camgirl from several years ahead of us, wrapping herself in electrical wires and somehow even making that look stunning.</p>
      <p>This is the first video that Doja Cat releases post-<i>Hot Pink</i>. Take a look below and let us know what you think. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/doja-cat-delivers-sophomore-effort-hot-pink-ft-tyga-gucci-mane-and-smino-new-mixtape.119749.html">Don't forget to give the album a spin too!</a></p>
