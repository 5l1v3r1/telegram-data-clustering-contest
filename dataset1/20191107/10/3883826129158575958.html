      <h1>Alun Cairns row 'shows why women do not report rape'</h1>

        <b>The victim in the collapsed rape trial that led to Alun Cairns' resignation as Welsh secretary said the case shows why women do not alert police.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Cairns <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50255710">said he did not know about a former aide's involvement in the collapse of her trial</a> until last week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50302173">But he resigned after BBC Wales obtained an email</a> sent to him discussing the case over a year ago.</p>
      <p>The victim has called for Mr Cairns to quit as a general election candidate. Mr Cairns has been asked to comment.</p>
      <p>The politician, who still intends to stand for the Conservatives in Vale of Glamorgan, denies any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party had said Mr Cairns was "completely unaware" until last week of the details of the case, which collapsed in April 2018 when his former aide Ross England, a witness, was accused by the trial judge of deliberate sabotage.</p>
      <p>But an email sent on 2 August 2018 shows Mr Cairns received an update regarding Mr England's situation.</p>
      <p>It was sent to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser, and copied to Richard Minshull - the director of the Welsh Conservatives - and another member of staff.</p>
      <p>It said: "I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."</p>
      <p>Four months after that email was sent, Mr England was selected to represent the Conservative Party in the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election.</p>

      <p>"It is because of situations like this that women don't come forward and report rape," the victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons and who previously worked in Mr Cairns' constituency office - told BBC Wales.</p>
      <p>"I think Alun Cairns did the right thing resigning," she said. "However, I feel that the way he has handled this does not reflect well on the Conservative Party and raises serious questions as to whether he's a suitable candidate to be standing in the general election.</p>
      <p>"What he did was to minimise my experience as a rape victim.</p>
      <p>"He was aware that Ross England had delayed my right to justice and made me go through another trial and still felt that he was a suitable candidate.</p>
      <p>"This brings into question his judgment and the party's judgment."</p>

      <p>Lord Davies of Gower, who has been the chairman of the party in Wales since 2017, said he "deeply regrets" the situation has arisen but added: "There will be an apology if I find out that one should be forthcoming.</p>
      <p>"I'm very sorry that this has happened to her. There is nothing I can do about it. It all happened before I became chairman of the party. I deeply regret it and I will deal with it very sympathetically," he told BBC Radio Wales.</p>
      <p>In his resignation letter, Mr Cairns said: "This is a very sensitive matter, and in light of continued speculation, I write to tender my resignation as secretary of state for Wales.</p>
      <p>"I will co-operate in full with the investigation under the ministerial code which will now take place and I am confident I will be cleared of any breach or wrong doing."</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50255710">a statement issued last week</a>, Lord Davies said he could "categorically state" that he and Mr Cairns were "completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week".</p>
      <p>Following Mr England's selection to stand as an AM, Mr Cairns endorsed the candidate as a "friend and colleague" with whom "it will be a pleasure to campaign".</p>
      <p>Mr England was suspended from his candidacy and his employment with the Conservative Party last week.</p>
      <p>At the rape trial Mr England, giving evidence, made claims he had had a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she has denied.</p>
      <p>The judge Stephen John Hopkins had earlier told the trial evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible.</p>
      <p>He told Mr England: "You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ€¦ get out of my court."</p>
      <p>The defendant James Hackett, a friend of Mr England's, was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial.</p>

      <p>Mr Cairns is facing further pressure to resign his candidacy in the upcoming general election from other parties.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the "moral right" of Mr Cairns to stand, while Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said he should do the "honourable thing" and withdraw.</p>
      <p>Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said he was "not fit to represent Wales".</p>
      <p>Assembly Tory leader Paul Davies has distanced himself from Mr England, saying he had <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50317086">fallen short of the standards expected of a Conservative candidate</a>.</p>
      <p>Shazia Awan-Scully, a former Conservative Party member who ran to be an MP in 2010, said the actions of the party "alienate women".</p>
      <p>"It says everything about the moral state of the party right now that the prime minister thinks it's OK for Alun Cairns to stand as a candidate I think it's absolutely disgraceful," she added.</p>
      <p>Other candidates standing in the Vale of Glamorgan include Sally Stephenson, for the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards for Welsh Labour and Ian Johnson for Plaid Cymru.</p>
      <p>The close of nominations is 14 November.</p>
