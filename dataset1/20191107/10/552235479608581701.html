      <p>Euromillions winner <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/euromillions-winner-jane-park-to-19877480">Jane Park</a>  has sadly miscarried - weeks after announcing she was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/euromillions-winner-jane-park-reveals-20730842">pregnant with her first baby</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jane-park">23-year-old</a> shared the heartbreaking news this morning.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's 4am and I'm wide awake but emotionally exhaused. I never thought I'd have to say this, but this pregnancy just wasn't meant to be.</p>
      <p>"I've never cried this hard in my life but with my mum by by side I know I'll get through this."</p>

      <p>Jane's management confirmed she miscarried, saying: "Sadly, Jane's pregnancy did not make full term."</p>
      <p>Jane revealed on October 26 she was expecting her first child and claimed that winning the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/euromillions-winner-jane-park-to-19877480">£1million</a> didn't come close to the elation she felt when she found out she was becoming a mum.</p>
      <p>She said: “Seeing the positive-result pregnancy test was more exciting than seeing the winning numbers on my lottery ticket. It’s a crazy time but I’m so happy.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“People think winning the lottery is the best thing that can happen to you but this feeling is just magical in a completely different way.</p>
      <p>"This is something that no amount of cash could buy."</p>
