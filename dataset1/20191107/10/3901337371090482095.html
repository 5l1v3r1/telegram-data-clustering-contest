      <p>A scroll down McCarthy’s Instagram timeline and it is clear to see just how much the 42-year-old loved his fast cars.</p>
      <p>His collection included a stunning personalized Bentley, a host of Porsches, including the Panamera, an Escalade, and the footballer’s favourite, the Range Rover Sport.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Check out all of Benni’s cars in the gallery above.</i>

      <p>Though it’s unclear whether the legendary figure still drives any of these vehicles, his collection, just like him, will surely go down as one of the best. </p>
