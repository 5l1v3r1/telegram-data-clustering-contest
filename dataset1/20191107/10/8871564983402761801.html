            <b>Beyond Stereotypes: Ethnic Minority Voices in Present Day HK</b>
          </a>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>Hong Kong is often referred to as “Asia’s world city,” and solidarity with Hong Kong’s ethnic minority community was <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/protesters-help-clean-up-mosque-after-police-fire-water-cannon-at-building/">one of the main themes at a protest last month</a>, but that doesn’t change the fact that many ethnic minority groups here are routinely marginalized and discriminated against.</p>
      <p>This free talk will feature two activists — one from Christian Action, an organization providing support to asylum seekers, and the other from African Community Hong Kong, which promotes community cohesion between African immigrants and Hongkongers — talking about their experiences as ethnic minorities living in Hong Kong, the changes they’ve seen in Hong Kong over the past five years, and how to build bridges that will help people move beyond stereotypes.</p>
      <p>Following the talk, there will be a dinner (you will have to pay for yourself) with the speakers. Entry is free but space is limited, so arrive early if you want to secure a space.</p>
