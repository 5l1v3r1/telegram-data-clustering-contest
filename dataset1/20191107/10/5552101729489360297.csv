假名片！馬偕前董事長及院長被控誣告案　獲北檢不起訴

亞洲大學附屬醫院副院長林璨控告台北馬偕紀念醫院前董事長劉伯恩、前院長施壽全誣告、妨害名譽案，台北地檢署日前偵結，檢察官以難認劉、施二人有故意捏造虛偽事實；向台中地檢署提告也非毫無所本為由，裁定不起訴處分。
全案緣起於林璨曾持印有「馬偕國際醫療副院長」名片，前往大陸拜會大陸在地人士並洽談籌備上海馬偕醫院，但台北馬偕醫院獲知此事後，馬偕財團法人前董事長劉伯恩、馬偕醫院前院長施壽全召開記者會，並對媒體宣稱，該院並無「國際醫療副院長」這職位，也沒委託林到上海籌備醫院，林璨持有的是「假名片」，隨後，指派法務人員向台中地檢署對林璨提出冒用商標和偽造文書告訴。
全案經台中地檢署偵查終結，裁定林璨不起處分，林遂轉回頭向台北地檢署控告馬偕財團法人前董事長劉伯恩、馬偕醫院前院長施壽全誣告及妨害名譽等罪。
林璨指控，他在2015年10月起至2016年8月止任職宣捷公司，經公司總經理宣昶有指派他至大陸地區成立醫院負責統籌建院事務，媒體報導的假名片是由宣捷公司交付其使用，他事先並不知情。且他也曾和宣昶有一同拜訪過時任馬偕醫院董事長的劉伯恩，及院長施壽全，宣昶有也證明有取得馬偕醫院授權印製名片。
劉、施2人在北檢偵查庭則是否認有誣告犯行，並辨稱並無授權印製爭議的「假名片」，他們也是在被媒體查詢後，才被動召開記者會統一說明，在記者會上的聲明和澄清，都是為了馬偕財團法人的名譽及利益並無誹謗意思。
檢察官在詢問相關證人及調查相關事證後，認定被告2人同意證人宣昶有印製系爭名片交付告訴人使用一節，並非無疑。從而，尚難認定被2人有何故意捏造虛偽事實的誹謗犯行。
不起訴處分書指出，本件既如前述無從認定被告2人確有同意或授權證人宣昶有或造訴人印製本案名片事實，被告2人委由馬偕醫院法務向台中地檢署提出告訴，也並非毫無所本，亦無捏造告訴事實，自難逕認涉有誣告罪嫌。

Fake business card! Former chairman and dean of Ma Rong was accused of false accusation
07 Nov 2019, 10:35 by Sun Wei, Photography Group
Lin Wei, deputy dean of the Affiliated Hospital of Asia University, accused Liu Boen, former chairman of the Taipei Ma Rong Memorial Hospital, and the former dean of the hospital, Shi Shouquan, and the nuisance case. The Taipei Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office recently investigated the prosecutor’s confession of Liu and Shi’s deliberate fabrication of hypocrisy. Facts; it is not unreasonable to lodge a complaint with the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office.
The whole case originated from Lin Biao’s business card with the “Ma Ying International Medical Vice President”. He traveled to the mainland to meet mainland Chinese and negotiated for the preparation of Shanghai Ma Rong Hospital. However, after the Taipei Ma Rong Hospital was informed of this, the former director of the Ma Rong Foundation Mr. Liu Boen and former director of Ma Rong Hospital, Shi Shouquan, held a press conference and announced to the media that there was no ""International Medical Associate Dean"" position and did not entrust Lin to Shanghai to prepare for the hospital. Lin Biao held a ""fake business card"". Subsequently, the legal personnel were assigned to the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office to inform Lin Biao of fraudulent use of trademarks and forgery documents.
The whole case was investigated by the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office, and Lin refused to take the punishment. Lin Biao turned back to the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office and accused Liu Boen, former chairman of the Ma Rong Foundation, and Shi Shouquan, former director of the Ma Rong Hospital, and slandered the reputation.
Lin Biao accused him of serving as Xuan Jie Company from October 2015 to August 2016. After the company’s general manager Xuan Xuan appointed him to set up a hospital in the mainland to take charge of the establishment of the hospital, the false business card reported by the media was announced. The company delivered its use and he did not know it beforehand. He also visited Xu Boen, the then chairman of the Ma Rong Hospital, and the director of the hospital, Shi Shouquan. Xuanzhen also proved that he had obtained the authorization to print business cards from Ma Rong Hospital.
In the Northern Inspection and Investigation Court, Liu and Shi were denied false accusations and identified the “fake business cards” that were not authorized to print disputes. They were also passively convened by the media after they were inquired by the media. The statements and clarifications at the meeting were all for the sake of the reputation and interests of the Ma Rong Foundation.
After inquiring about the relevant witnesses and investigating the relevant evidence, the prosecutor found that the two defendants agreed that the witnesses had announced that they had printed a business card and told the person to use the section. This is not undoubted. Therefore, it is still difficult to determine what is wrong with the two people who deliberately fabricated false facts.
The non-prosecution penalties pointed out that this article is not as clear as the above, that the defendant has two consents or authorizes the witness to declare or the respondent to print the business card facts of the case. The defendant 2 is appointed by the Ma Rong Hospital Legal Affairs to the Taichung District Prosecutor’s Office. It is not unfounded, nor is it fabricated to tell the facts.
