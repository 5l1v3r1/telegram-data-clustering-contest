      <p>A Co-op petrol station has reopened after the ceiling collapsed last night forcing the store to close.</p>
      <p>A customer at the Co-op in Staddiscombe sent us footage and <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/live-coop-ceiling-collapses-flooding-3509565">told Plymouth Live yesterday evening</a> that he was shopping in the store when water began gushing from the ceiling.</p>
      <p>Customers were told to leave and the store was closed.</p>
      <p>Jordan, aged 22, saw the ceiling "bowing" before it collapsed and water started pouring all over the floor.</p>
      <p>Jordan said: "I was just getting a quick drink when a bloke told a member of staff there was a bit of a leak through the ceiling. I went round into the aisle, being nosey, and saw water dripping through the light fitting.</p>

      <p>"I pulled my mate back as I could see the ceiling bowing and then told a member of staff there's no way the store can stay open, in case the whole ceiling comes down."</p>
      <p>He said: "I used to work at a supermarket and a leak like this caused an electrical fire. With that I went to the till where two ladies were serving and told them they need to get people out. One lady said, 'OK, everyone out'. The store is now completely closed."</p>
      <p>This morning, a spokesperson for the store has confirmed that it has now re-opened as usual and the flooding "wasn't anything major".</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Plymouth, there were reports of flooding as bad weather and storms battered the region.</p>
