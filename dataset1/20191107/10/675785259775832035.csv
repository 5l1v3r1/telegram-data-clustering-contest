Arsene Wenger reckons Liverpool are favourites to beat Manchester City in this weekend's Premier League crunch match.
The Reds are unbeaten in the league this season and go into the match six points clear of rivals City after 11 games played.
Champions City are playing catch-up, but have won five of their last six matches in all competitions and will see the contest as the perfect opportunity to close the gap.
Wenger won three Premier League titles in 22 years as Arsenal boss and was asked for his thoughts on the match. The Frenchman explained why, for him, Liverpool are favourites.

""Well we have seen in recent years that they are very tight games,"" Wenger told beIN Sports.
""We know Man City will take the game to Liverpool, and that Liverpool will be very dangerous on the counter-attack.

""I personally feel they could not afford to lose [Aymeric] Laporte, Manchester City.
""If you look at their results, they still play great football but they are a fractionally a bit more vulnerable defensively. And that could be a big handicap against Liverpool.""
