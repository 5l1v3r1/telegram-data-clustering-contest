      <h2>Unbeaten Liverpool play host to champions Man City, who are have won five of their last six matches in all competitions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:02:42+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsene Wenger reckons Liverpool are favourites to beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in this weekend's Premier League crunch match.</p>
      <p>The Reds are unbeaten in the league this season and go into the match six points clear of rivals City after 11 games played.</p>
      <p>Champions City are playing catch-up, but have won five of their last six matches in all competitions and will see the contest as the perfect opportunity to close the gap.</p>
      <p>Wenger won three Premier League titles in 22 years as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss and was asked for his thoughts on the match. The Frenchman explained why, for him, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are favourites.</p>

      <p>"Well we have seen in recent years that they are very tight games," Wenger told beIN Sports.</p>
      <p>"We know Man City will take the game to Liverpool, and that Liverpool will be very dangerous on the counter-attack.</p>

      <p>"I personally feel they could not afford to lose [Aymeric] Laporte, Manchester City.</p>
      <p>"If you look at their results, they still play great football but they are a fractionally a bit more vulnerable defensively. And that could be a big handicap against Liverpool."</p>
