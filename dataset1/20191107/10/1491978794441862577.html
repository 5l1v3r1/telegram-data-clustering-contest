      <p>1) The yin and yang of goal celebrations: none more modern than this one, from Brazil, in which the Santos forward Marinho <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/nov/05/santos-forward-marinho-performs-var-celebration-after-scoring-video">mimics a VAR check after scoring</a> but, far away from the world of contentious technology, check out what this last-minute <a href="https://twitter.com/MattFri94/status/1190694905447931904?s=04&amp;fbclid=IwAR1LOCVked8kWZA8g1xP5H_YPLL-bhJtACMhD-TQbFT9jKr45s7Uhis-OuE">FA Vase equaliser means for Falmouth Town’s players and fans</a>. The visitors, Longlevens, had been 2-0 up going into second-half stoppage time. Falmouth eventually won 3-2 after extra-time.</p>

      <p>2) Nicola Adams announced her retirement this week. The Yorkshire fighter was as popular a figure as British boxing has produced in recent years, so let’s reminds ourselves why: Here’s her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fJHOYFESQI">London 2012 gold medal bout against China’s Ren Cancan</a> in all its glory, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4teIw6h5a8s">her reaction to it</a>. Four years later in Rio, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcxsh49BSA8">she did it again</a>. Here’s the full fight from her last bout as a pro, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve1-iZBzbO8">against Maria Salinas in September</a>.</p>
      <p>3) We’re used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGw-bYm0VP8">cats invading the pitch in English football grounds</a>, wedged as they often are between rows of terraced houses, but less common is the sight of a moggy doing a lengthy run into the end zone at an NFL match. So, here’s to this furry feline <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7g19GzFkg">entertaining the crowd at the Cowboys-Giants game</a>! Golf’s always good for animal intruders, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43vii7vT44I">Here’s a top 10 for you</a>.</p>

      <p>4) Congratulations to England’s Emily Scarrat on being crowned women’s world rugby union <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/england-emily-scarratt-womens-world-player-of-the-year">player of the year</a> last weekend. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpguliNkaTE">This is why she won</a>, and here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tsSO3tJilA">she is telling her story</a>, and having a more trivial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR-cqJROT84">quickfire chinwag with James Haskell</a>.</p>
      <p>5) <a href="https://twitter.com/RadioMARCA/status/1191405664180088833">Yaya Touré gets sent off after only 10 seconds </a>for kicking an opponent up the backside in a match for Qingdao Huanghai against Nantong Zhiyun in China. It’s certainly a good way to get out of 89 minutes and 50 seconds’ worth of running.</p>
      <p>6) Andrei Svechnikov <a href="https://twitter.com/NHL/status/1189657172864651265">is the first NHL player in history to score the “Michigan” goal</a>. It’s quite something. Can’t score from here, can he? We have more ice-hockey genius here, too, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v_F-peobEA">courtesy of Matthew Tkachuk</a>.</p>
