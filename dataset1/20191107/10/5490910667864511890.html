      <p><b>NEW FRIENDS: </b><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/prada-2/">Prada</a> and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/adidas/">Adidas</a> are tickling curiosity by teasing a new collaboration. On Thursday morning, the Italian luxury house posted a photo on Instagram of <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/despite-margin-pressure-q3-adidas-predicts-positive-year-end-spurt-1203362895/">Adidas</a> and an Adidas Originals shoe boxes peeking out of a classic white <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/pradas-chairman-on-equal-rights-consumer-power-1203364028/">Prada</a> shopping bag. The hashtag reads Pradaforadidas.</p>
      <p>No other details were available, but followers were quick to react with flame, heart and clapping hands emojis. One Adidas fan was quick to dub the partnership “Pradidas.”</p>

      <p>The association of the two brands surely took many by surprise, although luxury and activewear have increasingly crossed paths. Adidas last month unveiled a new unique digital store in London which will launch exclusive products, including a collaboration with artist Lucy Bryant, and has a <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/grimes-to-appear-in-fall-ad-campaign-for-adidas-by-stella-mccartney-1203220184/">history of partnerships </a>with designers and artists ranging from Stella McCartney, Raf Simons and Rick Owens to Pharrell Williams.</p>
