07 Nov 2019, 10:32 by 社會組, 攝影組
有媒體報導，知名牙醫陳俊龍日前遭人控訴，指他與「英業達」創辦人葉國一兒子葉力誠合股「里昂哈佛數位科技」公司，並擔任核心教學人物，卻在一個植牙教學的合作案中，A走1名徐姓股東300萬元。對此，陳俊龍今（5日）發聲明嚴正駁斥，表示徐姓股東是不實指控，將對其提出法律訴訟。

以下為陳俊龍聲明全文：

針對近日媒體報導，有關里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司投資與哈佛大學捐款乙事，本人說明澄清如下，以正視聽：
一、 本人以提供專業的醫術，醫治病人為一生之志業，並致力推動植牙教學，就植牙及植體相關技術，長期投注心力研發相關技 術、器材及臨床案例。
二、 本人基於推廣植牙技術之理念及研發成果及牙醫教學，過去曾與邱小容、徐紹傑成立之里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司協議合作，進行教學研習合作與植體經銷等事宜，惟邇來本人察覺邱小容、徐紹傑經營管理之里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司諸多行為不符合雙方合作共識及約定，發生向醫生收取費用後卻未購貨、中飽私囊、帳務不實、積欠應付款項、另行設立公司規避契約義務等涉嫌違法違約之行為，衡諸以上種種，本人已發函終止與邱小容、徐紹傑、里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司間之一切合作關係。
三、 本人身為美國哈佛大學校友及哈佛牙醫學院董事會董事，向來致力於貢獻所學回饋母校及學子，長期與哈佛大學保持互動，就研發牙醫治療技術及發展相關議題，交換意見及合作，共同為牙醫領域發展貢獻一份心力。對於哈佛大學之捐款，實與里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司毫無關係，故本人自無對其提出捐款發票之必要，以免遭有心人士利用，對外散布不實消息， 有害哈佛大學及本人聲譽。
四、 又，本人自始至終均明確告知參與本人教學之學員及邱小容、徐紹傑、里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司並無參與教學後可取得哈佛大學牙醫學院認證乙事，報導所稱並非屬實。邱小容、徐紹傑雖意欲透過本人與哈佛大學合作並提出構想草約，惟本人對其內容並未同意。於此期間，里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司仍曾請託本人與哈佛大學溝通授予認證事宜，惟此等要求並不符合哈佛大學之政策，哈佛大學及本人立場相同，皆是明確婉拒。邱小容、徐紹傑、里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司等知之甚詳。
五、 本人得知里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司股東邱小容、徐紹傑提出與事實不符之陳述，實感遺憾。本人與邱小容、徐紹傑、里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司已無合作關係，尚請該等人士勿以與本人合作或哈佛捐款之名招攬投資或從事業務。懇請相關人士查察。為維護本人之名譽，謹澄清說明如上，以正視聽。本人並擬對邱小容、徐紹傑及里昂哈佛數位科技股份有限公司等就其等帳務不實、收取費用卻未購貨行為所涉詐欺、背信等 罪嫌及其他違約事項，提起民、刑事法律救濟。

Charged A to take shareholders 3 million yuan Dentist Chen Junlong: false accusation will be announced
07 Nov 2019, 10:32 by Social Group, Photography Group
According to media reports, well-known dentist Chen Junlong has been accused of cooperating with Ye Rongcheng, the founder of ""Ying Ye Da"", to join the ""Lyon Harvard Digital Technology"" company as a core teaching figure, but in a cooperation in dental implant teaching. In the case, A took a 3 million shareholder of Xu. In this regard, Chen Junlong issued a statement on the 5th (September), resolutely refuted that Xu’s shareholder is a false accusation and will file a lawsuit against him.

The following is the full text of Chen Junlong's statement:

In response to recent media reports, regarding the investment of Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd. and Harvard University, I clarify the following as follows:
First, I provide professional medical skills, treat patients as a lifelong career, and strive to promote the teaching of implants, on implants and implant-related technologies, long-term betting on the development of related technologies, equipment and clinical cases.
Second, based on the concept of promoting dental implant technology and research and development results and dentistry teaching, in the past, I have cooperated with Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd., which was established by Qiu Xiaorong and Xu Shaojie, to conduct teaching and research cooperation and plant distribution, but I have come to see it. Many actions of Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd., managed by Qiu Xiaorong and Xu Shaojie, did not meet the consensus and agreement of the two parties. After charging the doctor, they did not purchase the goods, they were not satisfied with the goods, the accounts were untrue, the accounts were owed, and the company was evaded. Contractual obligations and other suspected violations of the law, and all kinds of above, I have sent a letter to terminate all cooperation with Qiu Xiaorong, Xu Shaojie, Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd.
3. As a board member of Harvard University and a board member of Harvard School of Dentistry, I have always been committed to contributing my school to my alma mater and students. I have long been interacting with Harvard University to exchange ideas and cooperation on research and development of dental treatment technology and development issues. Contribute to the development of the dentistry field. For Harvard University's donation, it has nothing to do with Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd., so I have no need to make invoices for donations, so as not to be used by people with a heart, to spread false news outside, which is harmful to Harvard University and my reputation.
IV. In addition, I have clearly informed the participants who participated in my teaching and Qiu Xiaorong, Xu Shaojie, and Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd. that they have obtained the certification of Harvard University School of Dentistry after they have not participated in the teaching. The report said that it is not true. Although Qiu Xiaorong and Xu Shaojie intended to cooperate with Harvard University and proposed a draft contract, I did not agree with the content. During this period, Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd. still asked me to communicate with Harvard University to grant certification. However, these requirements are not in line with Harvard University's policy. Harvard University and I have the same position and are clearly rejected. Qiu Xiaorong, Xu Shaojie, Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd., etc. know very well.
5. I am sorry to learn that the shareholders of Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd. Qiu Xiaorong and Xu Shaojie have submitted statements that are inconsistent with the facts. I have no relationship with Qiu Xiaorong, Xu Shaojie, and Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd., and these people are not allowed to solicit investment or engage in business in the name of cooperating with me or Harvard. I ask the relevant people to check. In order to maintain my reputation, I would like to clarify the above as for the above. I also intend to bring civil and criminal legal remedies to Qiu Xiaorong, Xu Shaojie and Lyon Harvard Digital Technology Co., Ltd. for fraudulent and other breaches of scams and other breach of contract, such as fraudulent misconduct and other breach of contract. .
