      <p>A 28 year old man who raised a metal extendable baton in an aggressive manner, while gardai tried to resolve a dispute two years ago, was the victim of a serious assault earlier five months ago for which he received hundreds of staples, Dundalk district court was told last week.</p>
      <p>Counsel for Martin Smith with an address at Ashling Park, Dundalk also told the court his client is awaiting an appointment with a neurologist arising out of the injuries sustained in the attack.</p>
      <p>The serious assault was initially referenced by the defendant’s legal counsel, who sought to explain why his client still owed 240 euro in relation to a criminal damage offence.</p>
      <p>Judge Eirinn McKiernan pointed out the charge started out in May 2018 when the barrister said his client had been the victim of a serious attack in May this year</p>
      <p>The court also heard that Martin Smith was acting in a threatening manner and was highly intoxicated and a danger to himself at Ashling Park, Dundalk on September 18, 2017.</p>
      <p>A month later gardai were called to a dispute outside the defendant’s home. Approximately 20 people were in the area at the time and the accused was standing in his front garden.</p>
      <p>Another man had a wooden bat and the accused was carrying a metal extendable baton, which the court was told he raised in an aggressive manner as gardai were attempting to resolve the situation.</p>
      <p>The court was further told of a further incident at Maxol on the Castletown Road, where the accused had discharged a fire extinguisher on the forecourt and had returned three hours later, and punched an aluminium panel on the wall outside the shop.</p>
      <p>The father of two had 48 previous convictions and his barrister told the court his client is now in receipt of illness benefit following a stabbing.</p>
      <p>The counsel said the number of staples inserted ran into the hundreds and his client is unable to work, is receiving physio and is awaiting an appointment with a neurologist in Beaumont hospital and due to his financial circumstances he was finding it difficult to come up with the balance of compensation. Judge McKiernan imposed a four month sentence and the rest of the charges taken into consideration.</p>
