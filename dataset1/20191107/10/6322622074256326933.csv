（吉隆坡7日讯）虽然大多数半导体业者第三季盈利走低，但腾达（Pentamaster Corp Bhd）的净利却增长25.56%，主要得益于自动测试设备（ATE）业务的收入提高。
腾达今日向大马交易所报备，截至9月杪第三季净利达2148万令吉，或每股4.52仙，高于上财年同期的1711万令吉，或每股3.6仙。

盈利走高归功于集团营运效率提升。
展望未来，尽管目前市场形势严峻且动荡，该集团预计现年的表现仍不俗。

其他乐观因素包括工厂自动化解决方案（FAS）市场的扩展，以及集团不断多元化和拓展至新领域，尤其是汽车和医疗行业。

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Although most semiconductor companies posted lower earnings in the third quarter, Pentamaster Corp Bhd's net profit increased by 25.56%, mainly due to higher revenue from the automated test equipment (ATE) business.
Tengda reported to the Bursa Malaysia today that its net profit for the third quarter ended September was 21.48 million ringgits, or 4.52 cents per share, up from RM17.11 million in the same period last fiscal year, or 3.6 cents per share.
The quarterly turnover was RM18.30 million, up 15.08% to RM126.63 million.
In the first nine months of the fiscal year of 2019, the net profit was reported at RM60.59 million, or 12.76 sen per share, compared with RM38.28 million, or 8.06 sen per share, a year ago, up 58.27% year-on-year; the turnover was also 300 million. Wanlingji, rose 17.47% to RM64.13 million.
The higher profitability was attributed to the improved operational efficiency of the Group.
Looking ahead, despite the current severe market situation and turmoil, the group expects to perform well in the current year.
Due to the increasing complexity and widespread adoption of smart sensors, the popularity of 3D sensing technology, and the Group's continued expansion in the optical and optoelectronics sectors, management expects that the business will show positive growth.
Other optimistic factors include the expansion of the Factory Automation Solutions (FAS) market and the Group's continued diversification and expansion into new areas, particularly in the automotive and medical industries.
