      <p>-z6tbNT_iYwTwo Celtic FC fans were stabbed in Rome on Wednesday evening as they clashed with Lazio supporters ahead of their teams' Europa League match.</p>
      <p>The incident took place outside the Flann O'Brien pub where supporters of the Glasgow club had gathered. Italian police said the pair have been transported to hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>Celtic and Lazio are scheduled to play in Rome's Stadio Olimpico on Thursday evening. Their first clash on October 24 resulted in a 2-1 win for the Scottish team but also led to Europe's football governing body, UEFA, to charge both clubs for their fans' behaviour.</p>
      <p>Both sides face disciplinary action for the display of an "illicit banner" with Celtic also charged with "illicit chants". The case will be dealt with during a meeting of the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on November 21.</p>
      <p>Ahead of their second meeting, Celtic had issued guidance to the 8,000 fans expected to travel to the Italian capital, asking them to "keep a low profile" and to "avoid wearing club colours while walking around the city".</p>
