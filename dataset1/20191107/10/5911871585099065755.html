      <p>Tomorrow, Wiki, the slurry and snaggletoothed New York rap great and former Ratking member, will come out with a new album called <i>OOFIE</i>. You should be excited about that. In the past few weeks, Wiki has shared the new singles “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061879/wiki-fee-fi-fo-fum-smarty-jones-feat-cleo-reed/music/">Fee Fi Fo Fum</a>,” “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061879/wiki-fee-fi-fo-fum-smarty-jones-feat-cleo-reed/music/">Smarty Jones</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063649/wiki-pesto-video/video/">Pesto</a>.” They have been great. And today, Wiki teams up with two gifted and intense peers, Denzel Curry and Lil Ugly Mane, on an excellent new song called “Grim.”</p>
      <p>A while back, Wiki and the grimy, self-lacerating Richmond, Virginia rapper Lil Ugly Mane were in a sort of punk-rap supergroup called Secret Circle with the California rapper Antwon. Last year, in the wake of sexual assault allegations against Antwon, Secret Circle <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1997391/secret-circle-break-up/news/">broke up</a>. Both Wiki and Lil Ugly Mane publicly affirmed their support for assault victims, and Lil Ugly Mane vented some serious disgust at Antwon. So “Grim” marks a sort of reunion between Lil Ugly Mane and Wiki.</p>
      <p>On “Grim,” all three rappers vent serious darkness over a heavy, staggering beat that Lil Ugly Mane co-produced with former Spank Rock collaborator XXXChange. Wiki: “Death don’t got no mercy / got you talking murky when you popping perkys.” Lil Ugly Mane: “Floating down the river Styx, counting daffodils / Ignoring all these emails from <i>Complex</i> and <i>Mass Appeal</i> / Thinking if I wasn’t such a pussy, I’d’ve had a deal.” Denzel Curry: “Telling myself that I’ll be fine is the point where it’s scariest.” It’s intense!
