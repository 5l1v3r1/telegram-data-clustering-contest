「希望他有一天能回來」　陳立農望海思父淚潰堤
07 Nov 2019, 10:29 by 溫雅雯
今年19歲的陳立農因為參加大陸選秀《偶像練習生》拿下第2名成績，以「NINE PERCENT」成員順利出道，他在團綜《限定的記憶》讓大家看到私下與媽媽、外公等家人相處的輕鬆面貌，坦言自己在工作滿檔的日子裡，特別會想家，而且一直掛念著已經很久沒見到的父親，談到傷心處不禁落淚。



曾經提過父親以前是醫生，後來卻在夜市賣魷魚，小學三年級時的陳立農就常陪父親在夜市擺攤，最懷念陪爸爸去釣魚的悠閒時光。陳立農說小時候常常和爸爸合吃一碗泡麵解決一餐，「當時爸爸會讓我吃麵，他說他喝湯和吃碎麵就可以，那時候的我不懂，現在想起來…」。

回到小時候生活的高雄，陳立農要求製作單位將車開到興達港，那是他和父親曾經一起釣魚的地方，陳立農表示最後聽到爸爸的聲音已經是2年半之前，「當時他打電話給我，說我可能再也不會再見到他了，有點像遺言吧，我有問他在哪裡，只聽到大海的聲音。」

陳立農臉上掛著淚痕，相信他的爸爸總有一天會出現，「我還在等，希望他有一天能回來。」陳立農說目前人生最重要的兩個時間點，一個是2018年《偶像練習生》獲得第2名時，一個是18歲生日的那天，但是失聯已久的爸爸都不能陪在自己身邊，讓他覺得很遺憾。他說他仍會重複每次提到父親要說的話，「不管你在哪裡，我都希望你一直在看著我，我會繼續努力，賺錢讓家人過更好的生活。」

""I hope he can come back one day."" Chen Linong Wang Haisi's tears break the embankment
07 Nov 2019, 10:29 by Wen Yawen
Chen Linong, 19, won the second place in the mainland draft ""Idol Trainee"", and the ""NINE PERCENT"" member made a smooth debut. He was in the ""Limited Memory"" of the group and let everyone see privately with his mother, grandfather and other family members. The easy face to get along with, frankly, in the days when I was working full, I was especially homesick, and I always missed my father who had not seen it for a long time. When I talked about sadness, I couldn’t help but cry.



I once mentioned that my father used to be a doctor, but later sold squid in the night market. Chen Linong, who was in the third grade of primary school, often accompanied his father in the night market and missed the leisure time with his father. Chen Linong said that when he was a child, he often shared a bowl of instant noodles with his father to solve a meal. ""My father would let me eat noodles at the time. He said that he could drink soup and eat broken noodles. I didn't understand it at that time. Now I think about it..."".

Back to Kaohsiung, who was a child, Chen Linong asked the production unit to drive the car to Xingda Port, where he and his father used to fish together. Chen Linong said that he finally heard his father’s voice two and a half years ago. ""At that time he called. I said that I may never see him again. It is a bit like a last word. I asked him where he was and only heard the sound of the sea.""

Chen Linong has tears on his face. I believe his father will appear one day. ""I am still waiting, I hope he will come back one day."" Chen Linong said that the two most important moments in life, one is the idol practice in 2018. When Sheng was the 2nd place, one was the day of his 18th birthday, but the father who had lost his connection for a long time could not stay with him, which made him feel very sorry. He said that he would still repeat what he said to his father every time. ""No matter where you are, I hope that you will always look at me. I will continue to work hard to make money for my family to live a better life.""
