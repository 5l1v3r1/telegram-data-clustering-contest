OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro updates

Current stable version: Android 10
When will the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro get Android 11? September 2020 (estimated)

The OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro launched on September 26, 2019, and October 10, 2019, respectively. Both launched with the latest version of Android out-of-the-box (Android 10). It’s expected both devices will receive at least two major Android updates in the future — Android 11 in 2020 and Android 12 in 2021. It’s possible that it will also receive an update to Android 13 in 2022, as the OnePlus 3T received four flavors of Android during its update lifespan (Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo, and Pie).
