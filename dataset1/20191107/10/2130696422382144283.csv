The joint investments are aimed at developing tech solutions that can spur new business models and improve the operational efficiency, safety and sustainability of the different clusters of maritime industry. The clusters include shipping, port logistics, port operations and maritime services.
For each startup, SEEDS Capital will match the co-investor's investment in a 7:3 (SEEDS:co-investor) ratio, up to the first S$500,000 from SEEDS. Thereafter, it will match the investment dollar for dollar up to a total investment of S$4 million from SEEDS.
Co-investors must have operations based in Singapore and be prepared to invest at least S$50,000 into each startup. They must help early-stage stage maritime tech startups to fast-track commercialisation, and provide mentorship and connections to potential clients.
SEEDS Capital had previously launched calls for co-investors in areas such as agrifoodtech, which culminated in seven co-investment partners appointed to pump more than S$90 million into startups.
