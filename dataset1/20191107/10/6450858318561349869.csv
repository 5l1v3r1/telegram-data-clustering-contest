Gamers are notoriously keen for a bargain - the closely followed Steam sales are a prime example - so it’s no surprise that people are always on the lookout for big deals on PlayStation 4 consoles and game, as well as additional PS4 accessories.
2019 is a great year for the PlayStation, with huge new games due for release in the run-up to Christmas, so it's a great time to pick up a console if you haven't already.
Best PS4 deals right now
There are great gaming discounts to be found all year round, not just in the run-up to Christmas. We’ve rounded up the best PS4 deals of November 2019 for you, right here.

Naturally, console bundles are among the most requested bargains. It’s become pretty typical to see a 500GB PS4 Slim with a game for £250, or the 1TB model for £330, so less than this is a bit of a bargain. Look for prices that drop below those, or bundles with even more games or an additional controller and other accessories.
The PS4 Pro is a little more expensive, and is worthwhile if you’ve got a 4K TV  or plan on getting one in the near future. If you have, the PS4 Pro will help you future-proof and enhance your overall gaming experience. Given the additional horsepower, it’s a very compelling alternative to the Slim and is easy to recommend. You’ll find bundles available for £350, so any less than that for the Pro is a good deal.
PlayStation VR bundles are sought-after, too. While the headset is officially available for around £200, you can often find bundles with additional games or other extras. Check out our separate round-up of VR deals for more on this.
Of course, loads of PS4 and PSVR games are available for low prices too - look for new releases at £35 or below, while older games often drop to just £10 or £15.
Where to find PS4 deals
Most major game retailers do discounts throughout the year. The best places to look are the likes of Amazon, Game, Currys and Argos.
