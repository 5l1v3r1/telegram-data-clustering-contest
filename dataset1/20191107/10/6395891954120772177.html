      <p><b>SANDUSKY, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Cedar Fair Entertainment says its amusement and water parks have seen another jump in attendance this year.</p>
      <p>The Sandusky, Ohio-based company says helping drive the increase are its popular Halloween and winter events along with new nighttime festivals at some of its parks.</p>
      <p>Attendance is up 4% overall this year at Cedar Fair's 11 amusement parks and five water parks across the U.S.</p>
      <p>The company said Wednesday that season pass sales for next year are up 50% compared with a year ago.</p>
      <p>Much of that is linked to a new discounted pass at the company's flagship park, Cedar Point, in Sandusky.</p>
      <p>Company officials say they plan to roll out more special events in 2020 to get more people in the parks during what are considered slower times of the year.</p>
