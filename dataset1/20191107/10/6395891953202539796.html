      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Contributions to tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts that Ohio offers to eligible children and adults with disabilities have exceeded $100 million.</p>
      <p>Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague (sprayg) said the STABLE Account program his office administers hit the mark this week.</p>
      <p>Ohio was the first state to participate when it launched the program in 2016. Since then, over 13,000 accounts have been opened, about 6,000 in-state and 8,000 out-of-state.</p>
      <p>Accountholders accumulate money for college, retirement or other purposes without losing eligibility for certain benefits programs, such as Medicaid, SSI and or SSDI.</p>
      <p>STABLE Accounts have normal bank accounts' saving and withdrawal features, while allowing for long-term investments like a 529 college savings account or 401(k). They're federal income tax-free so long as the money is spent on qualified disability expenses.</p>
