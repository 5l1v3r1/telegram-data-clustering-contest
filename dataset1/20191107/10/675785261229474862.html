      <h1>Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker almost had huge reveal for Carrie Fisher's Leia</h1>
      <h2>Carrie Fisher's brother Todd Fisher has revealed that General Leia Organa had a huge twist role</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:16:47+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The Rise of Skywalker is set to bring the Skywalker saga to an end.</p>
      <p>However, it has now been revealed that the late <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/carrie-fisher">Carrie Fisher</a> almost paid a much more pivotal role in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a> in her iconic role of Leia Organa, before she sadly passed away in 2016.</p>
      <p>Carrie Fisher's brother Todd Fisher revealed to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/details-of-carrie-fishers-rise-of-skywalker-role-revealed-210514180.html?guccounter=2">Yahoo Entertainment</a> : "She was going to be the big payoff in the final film. She was going to be the last Jedi, so to speak. That’s cool right?"</p>
      <p>The interview revealed that Leia would have wielded a lightsaber as a full-fledged Jedi warrior.</p>
      <p>He also revealed how confident he was in director <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/j-j-abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> adapting the role in the wake of the actress' death.</p>
      <p>He added: “The truth is that J.J. Abrams was great friends with Carrie... he had an extraordinary sense of love for her."</p>

      <p>Fisher also revealed: "They had eight minutes of footage. They grabbed every frame and analyzed it... and then reverse-engineered it and [got] it into the story the right way. It’s kind of magical."</p>
      <p>On how well this new role for General Leia Organa works, Fisher reveals he is very happy with the "beautiful" way they have managed to provide a new "payoff" to the character.</p>
      <p>He explained: "This is, in its own way, a payoff. ... It’s Carrie talking to us all from beyond. The beautiful thing about the concept of the Force is that there is no real death; you just exist in another dimension.</p>
      <p>"So Carrie is looking down or sideways or wherever and is still part of us. To be able to see that — it’s magical stuff only in the movies."</p>
      <p>Other figures to appear from the original Star Wars trilogy in the new instalment include Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, and Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine.</p>
      <p>It's sure to be an emotional final instalment.</p>
