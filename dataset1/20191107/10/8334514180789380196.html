      <p>SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of Chinese stocks rose to a record high by the end of the third quarter, despite the ups and downs in a protracted trade dispute with the United States, as Beijing further opens its financial markets to help fund businesses.</p>

      <p>By end-Sept, Chinese equities held by foreigners were at a record of 1.77 trillion yuan ($253.14 billion) after having risen for four straight months, up nearly 40% in a year, the latest data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) shows.</p>
      <p>China is stepping up opening of its heavily policed, giant capital markets, having recently scrapped investment quotas under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme.</p>
      <p>Cross-border yuan usage jumped 20% in Jan-Sept on capital market opening, with about 6 trillion yuan of cross-border yuan payment for securities investment, according to a central bank official.</p>

      <p>The data also showed investors had been net buyers of A-shares through the Stock Connect linking Hong Kong and the mainland for the past five months through October, purchasing a net 158.2 billion yuan worth of A-shares.</p>
      <p>The Stock Connect is a scheme to allow foreign investors convenient access to the A-share market.</p>
      <p>Robust foreign inflows into the stock market of the world’s second largest economy come as major international index providers, including MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&amp;P, have begun or are stepping up inclusion of China A-shares and bonds on global indexes.</p>

      <p>The heaviest foreign flows were into the consumer sector, as foreign investors hoped for China’s policy stimulus to bolster an economy hurting in a nearly two-year long trade war with the United States.</p>
      <p>Beijing has rolled out a raft of measures to boost domestic consumption, which accounts for over 60% of its economy, to help shore up faltering demand.</p>
      <p>The consumer sector remained the most preferred by the northbound flows via the Stock Connect, with food and beverage, home appliances and healthcare stocks making up 40% of those foreign investors’ A-share holdings by market value, analysts at Essence Securities said in a report.</p>

      <p>The preference for the consumer sector was evident from the mainland-listed firms in which foreigners invested the most heavily, such as top liquor makers Kweichow Moutai (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/600519.SS">600519.SS</a>) and Wuliangye Yibin (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/000858.SZ">000858.SZ</a>), and leading home appliances makers Midea Group (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/000333.SZ">000333.SZ</a>) and Gree Electric (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/000651.SZ">000651.SZ</a>).</p>
