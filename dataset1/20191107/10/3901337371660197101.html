        <b>SS4 &amp; SS10 (ROA)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kick-off at 20:00 (CAT)</p>
      <p>Absa Premiership, Friday 8 November</p>
      <p>A top-eight battle awaits at the Bidvest Stadium. The Students have quietly gone about their business, winning five of their six matches with 11 goals scored in that period. Matsatsantsa come into the fixture on a high having won the MTN8 and have key players in Thamsanqa Gabuza and Bradley Grobler performing consistently. The match will be a tactical showdown as both Kaitano Tembo and Gavin Hunt always deliver a masterclass in tactics.</p>

        <b>Kaizer Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates SS4 - </b>
        <b>(SA), SS10 (SA) &amp; SS8 (ROA)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kick-off at 15:30 (CAT)</p>
      <p>Absa Premiership, Saturday 9 November</p>
      <p>The fourth Soweto Derby of 2019 kicks off with a match that carries significance for both sides. Chiefs have been impressive thus far, having only lost once in their last eight games, including commanding wins over Cape Town City and Sundowns. Pirates will look to continue their dominance over their rivals, but their indifferent form will be worrisome for Rulani Mokwena and his troops.</p>

        <b>Mamelodi Sundowns vs Petro de Luanda</b>
      </p>

The Pretoria based team has won three of their four matches in the tournament thus far including an 11-1 win over Cote d’Or. Petro de Luanda have won two and drawn two of their four games going into their trip to South Africa for their first game of the group stage.</p>
