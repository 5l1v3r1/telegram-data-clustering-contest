幼保無償化、３３施設が便乗値上げの疑い…厚労省など調査

07 Nov 2019, 10:17

　１０月にスタートした幼児教育・保育無償化に伴い、保育料などを大幅に引き上げる「便乗値上げ」をした疑いのある認可外保育施設や私立幼稚園が３３か所に上ることが７日、厚生労働省と文部科学省の調査で分かった。
　３３か所のうち認可外保育施設は２８施設。半数の１４施設が、無償化の対象となる３～５歳児のみを対象とした値上げなど国が９月に通知で「便乗値上げ」として例示したものに該当したという。残り１４施設も便乗値上げの疑いがあるとして、都道府県などが調べている。私立幼稚園では、少なくとも５園で便乗値上げの可能性があるという。

Childcare free of charge, 33 facilities suspected of raising piggyback price ... Survey by Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

07 Nov 2019, 10:17

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare will raise 33 non-authorized childcare facilities and private kindergartens that have been suspected of raising the piggyback price, which will significantly raise childcare fees, etc., as a result of the early childhood education and childcare that started in October. I learned from a survey by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
Of the 33 locations, 28 are non-authorized childcare facilities. Half of the 14 facilities are said to have been designated as “price increase” in a notification in September, such as a price increase only for 3-5 year old children who are eligible for gratification. Prefectural governments are investigating that the remaining 14 facilities are suspected of raising piggyback prices. In private kindergartens, there is a possibility of raising the piggyback price in at least 5 gardens.
