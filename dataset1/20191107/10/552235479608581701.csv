Euromillions winner Jane Park  has sadly miscarried - weeks after announcing she was pregnant with her first baby.
The 23-year-old shared the heartbreaking news this morning.
She said: ""It's 4am and I'm wide awake but emotionally exhaused. I never thought I'd have to say this, but this pregnancy just wasn't meant to be.
""I've never cried this hard in my life but with my mum by by side I know I'll get through this.""

Jane's management confirmed she miscarried, saying: ""Sadly, Jane's pregnancy did not make full term.""
Jane revealed on October 26 she was expecting her first child and claimed that winning the £1million didn't come close to the elation she felt when she found out she was becoming a mum.
She said: “Seeing the positive-result pregnancy test was more exciting than seeing the winning numbers on my lottery ticket. It’s a crazy time but I’m so happy.
 
“People think winning the lottery is the best thing that can happen to you but this feeling is just magical in a completely different way.
""This is something that no amount of cash could buy.""
