      <h1>ANZ employee gets life term for $3.9 mln fraud - VnExpress International</h1>

      <p>The Ho Chi Minh City People’s Court Thursday pronounced the sentence on Nguyen Pham Gia Tho, 30, former head of customer relations at an ANZ branch in HCMC's District 7.</p>
      <p>It handed down a similar sentence to Tho’s sister-in-law Nguyen Tuong Vi for assisting him in stealing the money. The court also ordered the two to compensate the bank with the stolen money.</p>
      <p>From 2015 to 2017, Tho forged signatures of customers to open internet banking accounts in their names.</p>
      <p>He stole a total of VND91.3 billion ($3.94 million) from these accounts, of which VND80 billion ($3.45 million) was sent to Vi to invest in her fruit importing company in HCMC.</p>
      <p>ANZ reported the theft to authorities towards the end of 2017 after Tho’s actions aroused suspicion.</p>
      <p>The trial was suspended several times as Vi was having a child.</p>
