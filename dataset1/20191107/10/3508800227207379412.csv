07 Nov 2019, 10:30 by nagee


我們想讓你知道的是為了吸引灣灣，他們準備了26個「禮物」，但過往那些收下禮物「回家」的人們，後來都怎麼樣了呢？

中國央視的主播海霞，在新聞節目上露著微笑，深情款款的說「灣灣回家吧」。為了吸引灣灣，他們還準備了26個「禮物」，但那些收下禮物的人們，後來都怎麼樣了呢？
西藏人收了，快樂到自己燒起來；新疆人收了，幸福的住在集中營，人人有宅，居住正義；香港人收了，社會和諧，從此無姦殺案，無可疑無爭議。台灣收下了，台灣安全，人民有錢，發大財。
話是這麼說，我們家的李明哲，什麼時候能才可以回家啊？


中共推「26條措施」要「灣灣回家」，影響選情只是其中一部分

What we want you to know is to attract Bay Bay. They have prepared 26 ""gifts"", but what happened to those who took the gift ""go home"" in the past?

Haixia, the anchor of China’s CCTV, showed a smile on the news program, and said that he would like to go home. In order to attract the Bay, they also prepared 26 ""gifts"", but what happened to those who received the gifts?
The Tibetans received it, and they were happy to burn themselves; the Xinjiang people collected, the happy people lived in the concentration camp, everyone had a house, and they lived in justice; Hong Kong people received it, and the society was harmonious. From then on, there was no suicide, no doubt and no dispute. Taiwan has accepted it, Taiwan is safe, the people have money, and they make a fortune.
That is to say, when can Li Mingzhe of our family go home?


The CCP pushes ""26 measures"" to ""go bay to go home"", affecting the election is only part of it
