      <p>Following the defeat in the national capital in the opening T20I, stand-in India captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> admitted that the pressure is not just on any particular department, but on the entire team to perform in the remaining two matches of the series.</p>
      <p>"Pressure is just on the team to perform, as simple as that. Not a particular department. You've lost as a team, you've not lost as a bowling unit. So the focus will be on the team," Rohit told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
