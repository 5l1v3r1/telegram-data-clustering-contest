NEW DELHI: India's boxing icon Mary Kom on Thursday thanked World Olympians Association (WOA) after the sports body granted her the use of post-nominal letters 'OLY'.
'OLY' signifies sportspersons' ongoing role in society as an Olympian, living and promoting the Olympic values.
Mary Kom shared the certificate of recognition on Twitter and wrote, ""Thank you so much for the RECOGNITION @worldolympians @iocmedia.""



Six-time world champion Mary Kom had to settle for a bronze medal in the Women's World Boxing Championships last month after facing a defeat in the semi-finals of the tournament.
It was Mary Kom's eighth world championships medal, which made her the only amateur boxer to achieve the feat with six gold, one silver and one bronze.
