Khalwale has been one of the most vocal supporters of McDonald Mariga, appearing in every press conference and rallies.
He changed his political stance and is now a staunch supporter of Deputy President William Ruto, from ODM’s Raila Odinga, with the pledge to deliver Western Kenya votes to jubilee come 2022 General Elections.
