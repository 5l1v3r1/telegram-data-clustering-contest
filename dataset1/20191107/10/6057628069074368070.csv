More children in need of aid in Cameroon - UNICEF
07 Nov 2019, 10:07 by Michael Kuduson, Zainab Ibrahim

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has announced that at least 1.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the northwestern and southwestern regions of Cameroon, of which half are children.

In a speech to the Parliament in Geneva, Switzerland, spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said that the humanitarian crisis has continued to affect nearly 2 million people, an increase of 15 times since 2017.
UNICEF says the problem is preventing children from accessing education, as thousands of schools remain closed as a result of attacks by independent separatists.
Mercado says more than 855,000 children have dropped out of school due to conflict in the northwestern and southwestern provinces of Cameroon.
OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said three schoolgirls were abducted last month, and said the lack of support was a problem that had hit the country like a failure. 41 percent of the $ 299 million she needs to get.
Laerke said the problem of poor roads affecting 65 percent of these areas has prevented aid workers from carrying out their work for fear of being kidnapped.
