      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): The Rubber Production Incentive (IPG) will remain at RM2.50 per kg, says Deputy Primary Industries Minister Datuk Seri Shamsul Iskandar Mohd Akin.</p>
      <p>He said the government does not intend to raise the IPG to RM3 per kg, as doing so would have a significant financial impact on the nation.</p>
      <p>“It has gone up by 30 sen from RM2.20 per kg previously, so I think it’s a good development for the people especially smallholders,” he said at the question-and-answer session at the Dewan Rakyat here today.</p>
      <p>He was replying to a supplementary question from Ahmad Tarmizi Sulaiman (PAS-Sik) on whether the ministry would raise the IPG to RM3 per kg to help rubber smallholders.</p>
      <p>In January this year, the government increased the Activation Pricing Level (PHP) from RM2.20 to RM2.50 per kg of scrap rubber.</p>
      <p>In another development, Shamsul said his ministry is in the midst of testing an online system for IPG claims by rubber tappers.</p>
      <p>He said the system is being implemented in seven states, where about 24,000 smallholders have made online claims.</p>
      <p>“We are now conducting a trial run for the online payment of IPG claims. The name has not been finalised but we have given it the provisional name of ‘e-rubber’.</p>
      <p>“We give our assurance that if the system proceeds smoothly, we will implement it nationwide,” he said, adding it will have a direct impact on latex entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>Rubber tappers and smallholders currently have to fill in an IPG claim form, which the village chief or rubber middleman then sends to the nearest Malaysian Rubber Board office. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
