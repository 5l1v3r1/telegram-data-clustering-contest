TV-B-Gone, the hidden-in-your-glasses edition
07 Nov 2019, 10:49 by Cory Doctorow



Facelesstech created a fun pair of ""smart glasses"" with an embedded a miniature attiny85 Arduino controller, and followed it up with a pair that concealed a TV-B-Gone (Mitch Altman's open source hardware gadget that cycles through all known switch-TV-off codes, causing any nearby screens to go black). It's a much less creepy use than the spy glasses with embedded cameras sold by Chinese state surveillance vendors. I'd certainly buy a pair! (via JWZ)
