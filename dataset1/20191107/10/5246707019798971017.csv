Now funding on Kickstarter
07 Nov 2019, 10:30 by Ryan Craddock



The developer behind Alwa's Awakening is set to launch a brand new game on Switch called Alwa's Legacy, as long as it can generate the necessary funds through Kickstarter, that is.
Eden Pixels describes the new title as a ""modern retro game full of dangerous dungeons, magical items and ancient secrets"". It's a non-linear adventure game said to be full of exploration, with no particular path being the 'correct' way to choose.
Here's a feature list and some screenshots:
Customize how you play - With our upgrade system you can choose how you want to play - Explorative, offensive or strategic. It’s your choice!Exploration is rewarded - Don’t leave any stone unturned, the world of Alwa is filled with secrets and finding them requires you to explore and solve puzzlesA non-linear experience - Combining exploration and different item upgrades allows you to find your own way through this adventure
Looks and sounds amazing - Enjoy crisp pixel-art combined with modern effects as well as a soundtrack made by chiptune extraordinaire RushJet1A challenge awaits - Quick reflexes are needed to navigate through the many challenging rooms and with easy-to-change settings anyone can enjoy Alwa’s Legacy












You can learn more about it and pledge your support over on the game's Kickstarter page. We imagine this has the potential to do pretty well with Switch fans - the original game's first week on the Switch eShop outperformed its first whole month on Steam.
Will you be backing this one? Are you hoping it does manage to make its way to Switch? Let us know in the comments.
