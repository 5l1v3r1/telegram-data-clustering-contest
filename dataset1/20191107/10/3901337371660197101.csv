Kaizer Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates SS4 - 
(SA), SS10 (SA) & SS8 (ROA)

Kick-off at 15:30 (CAT)
Absa Premiership, Saturday 9 November
The fourth Soweto Derby of 2019 kicks off with a match that carries significance for both sides. Chiefs have been impressive thus far, having only lost once in their last eight games, including commanding wins over Cape Town City and Sundowns. Pirates will look to continue their dominance over their rivals, but their indifferent form will be worrisome for Rulani Mokwena and his troops.
 

Mamelodi Sundowns vs Petro de Luanda

CAF Champions League, Friday 29 November
Mamelodi Sundowns, the 2016 champions of the CAF champion league, host the Angolan side Petro de Luanda in a Group C clash. The Pretoria based team has won three of their four matches in the tournament thus far including an 11-1 win over Cote d’Or. Petro de Luanda have won two and drawn two of their four games going into their trip to South Africa for their first game of the group stage.
