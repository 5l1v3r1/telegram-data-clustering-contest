      <p>Cork City have made Cian Coleman the first signing of the Neale Fenn era. The midfielder returns to City after a three-year absence that saw him play for Cobh Ramblers, Limerick and St Patrick’s Athletic.</p>
      <p>He made three senior appearances for the club as a teenager, before departing in search of regular first team football. The 22-year-old said: “I’m delighted. I spent a few years away to try and get first them football but I’m back now and I’m delighted and I’m ready to go.</p>
      <p>Fenn welcomed the arrival of Coleman:</p>
      <blockquote>We’re delighted to have Cian on board. He’s a young player that I’ve admired since my time at Longford, when he played against us for Limerick. I’m delighted that we managed to sign him.</blockquote>
      <p>"He’s going to bring energy in midfield, physicality and he’s got quality as well. I’m sure that the fans know him, he’s been here before as a youngster so it’s great for the club that we could get him back.”</p>
      <p>City also confirmed the departures of Joel Coustrain, Eoghan Stokes, Colm Horgan and Karl Sheppard.</p>
