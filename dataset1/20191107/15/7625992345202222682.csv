COVER STORY: With deepest sympathy: The complications of coping with grief | Watch VideoDealing with death is simply part of living life, as every person who dies leaves behind loved ones who must face a grieving process. And while most of us eventually adapt to a ""new normal,"" one in 10 endures what researchers calls ""complicated grief."" For them the acute phase of grief never lets up. Susan Spencer investigates the study of grief, and how a website, Modern Loss, is sharing personal stories of grief, loss and coping from around the world, sometimes with unexpected twists.
BOOK EXCERPT: ""Modern Loss: Candid Conversation About Grief. Beginners Welcome.""Rebecca Soffer writes that, when communing about grief in a social media era, no ""like"" can replace a conversation, or a hug, or shared double martinis.
BOOK EXCERPT: ""Black Widow"" by Leslie Gray StreeterThe Palm Beach Post columnist recounts the terrible night when her life was turned upside-down, and her unplanned, forced accommodation to the newly-dominant emotion of grief.
