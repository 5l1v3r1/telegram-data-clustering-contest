      <p>Candidates from pro-European Union parties have entered a pact to give voters a single Remain choice in dozens of constituencies at the General Election.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens will not run candidates against each other in 60 seats across England and Wales.</p>
      <p>The deal, brokered by the Unite To Remain group, follows an agreement earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Lib Dems took the seat from the Conservatives after the other two parties stood aside.</p>
      <p>Heidi Allen, chairwoman of Unite To Remain and previously MP for South Cambridgeshire, said the cross-party arrangement is "unprecedented in modern British political history".</p>
      <p>In the Isle of Wight and Brighton Pavilion, the Greens will be given a free run, while in the constituencies of Richmond Park and Cheltenham, the Lib Dems will be unopposed by other Remain-backing parties.</p>
      <p>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she is "delighted" that an agreement has been reached, adding that it is a "significant moment for all people who want to support remain candidates across the country".</p>
      <p>Ms Allen said: "This is a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> election, and staying in the European Union is possible - and this is the deciding moment.</p>
      <p>"We are putting party politics aside in the interest of our country and have cemented a cross-party arrangement whereby Remain-voting parties in England and Wales are working together to back one Remain candidate.</p>
      <p>"With a single Remain candidate in each of these seats, we can deliver a greater number of MPs into Parliament. This is our opportunity to tip the balance of power away from the two largest parties and into a progressive Remain Alliance.</p>
      <p>"The number of seats achieved, and the scope of what we're seeking to achieve, is unprecedented in modern British political history. Together, we can unite to Remain."</p>
      <p>Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said: "In these deeply serious times, we need grown-up politics that puts our countries before parties.</p>
      <p>"The single most important thing in this election is that we return as many pro-Remain MPs back in Parliament as possible."</p>
      <p>Sian Berry, co-leader of the Green Party, said: "The crash-out Brexit the Tories are pushing for would be a disaster for people up and down England and Wales. And for action on climate chaos."</p>
      <p>Ms Allen, who will not be standing in the general election, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the "sense of a common purpose really focused minds".</p>
      <p>On why Labour was excluded from the pacts, she said: "Labour are not a Remain party unequivocally. They still want to negotiate a new Brexit deal and potentially facilitate Brexit."</p>
