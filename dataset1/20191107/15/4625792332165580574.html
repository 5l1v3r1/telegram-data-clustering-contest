      <h1>'Two million voices saying listen to us': Oprah calls on Texas governor to stop execution</h1>

      <p>Oprah Winfrey urged Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to stop a death row inmate from being executed, adding her voice to a petition demanding Abbott act.</p>
      <p>Rodney Reed has been on death row since 1998 for the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/texas-judge-sets-execution-date-for-rodney-reed"><u>murder of Stacey Stites,</u></a> and his execution is scheduled for Nov. 20. Reed and his <a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/stand-with-rodney-reed-on-texas-death-row/"><u>attorneys</u></a> from The Innocence Project argue that he has been denied a full and fair trial because there is untested DNA evidence and claims that Stites’ ex-husband may have committed the crime.</p>
      <p>Reed claimed he and Stites were having an affair, which is why his DNA was present on her body when she died.</p>
      <p>More than 1.5 million people, including several celebrities, have signed a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/15m-sign-petition-stop-rodney-reeds-execution-66805028"><u>petition</u></a> calling on Abbott to delay Reed’s execution and give him a new trial.</p>
      <p>In an interview on <i>CBS This Morning</i>, Winfrey asked Abbott to use his power to stop the execution.</p>
      <p>“At least the governor has to pause and look at the 2 million people who have signed a petition,” she said. “Two million voices saying listen to us, something is off here. Something needs to be done.”</p>
      <p>“Governor, if you’re watching, hello. I think this is a sign you’re supposed to at least not execute, but look at it,” she said.</p>
      <p>Abbott also received a letter from 26 legislators in Texas, but he has not made any decision to delay Reed's execution.</p>
