Prada and Adidas Are Fashion's Newest Power Couple
07 Nov 2019, 15:19 by Nerisha Penrose
If any brand knows its way around collaboration, its Adidas. But its latest team-up isn't with your favorite rapper (the brand has partnered with Kanye) or the hottest star athlete (David Beckham, James Harden). This time Adidas is dipping its three-striped insole into the luxury pool for a special collaboration with Prada.
""#Pradaforadidas @adidas @adidasoriginals. Coming soon,"" the Italian luxury label succinctly captioned a photo on Instagram, which showed two Adidas shoe boxes—one in the brand's signature blue hue and one in black—peeking out of an oversized white Prada shopping bag. Prada's caption directed followers to click a link in its bio, which didn't reveal any further information about the collab. Based on the photo, however, it's safe to assume the brands are whipping up two pairs of sneakers.



Talks of the #Pradaforadidas collaboration began back in October when Twitter user @pyleaks tweeted the two brands would be releasing two sneakers ""soon."" According to the tweet, the sneaker will be titled Adidas Prada Sailing, will arrive in three different colorways: white, silver, and red.



When it comes to designer collaborations, Adidas is no amateur. The sports brand has previously teamed up with Raf Simmons, who re-designed Adidas' iconic Stan Smith silhouette and the chunky Oweego shoe. Adidas's growing list of collaborators also include Pharrell Williams, Rick Owens, Alexander Wang, Stella McCartney and more.
