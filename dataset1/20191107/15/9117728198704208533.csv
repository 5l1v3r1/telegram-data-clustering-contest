Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel shared a special moment after the US Grand Prix and the German has admitted he's happy for Hamilton but insists he isn't content with Ferrari being so far back.

Hamilton wrapped up a sixth Formula 1 World Championship at the Circuit of the Americas, P2 enough to beat Valtteri Bottas to the title. Hamilton has been a class above the rest of the field once again this season with his ten race wins more than double anyone else.
Vettel and the Brit shared a moment before the podium in Austin and the four-time World Champion admitted he's happy for Hamilton but it isn't good seeing Ferrari so far back.
""I think now is the time to write as many good things as you can,"" said Vettel as quoted by Motorsport.

""I think if somebody wins the title six times then he deserves all of it. That is what I told him as well.


""I am happy for him. I am not happy that we are not in contention this year and we are so far back.


""We need to respect what he achieved the last years and also this year, plus together with his team how strong they have been. I am happy for him. But less happy for us.""
