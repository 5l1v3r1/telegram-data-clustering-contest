      <p>GIYANI (South Africa), Nov 7 — With a sleek swish of his knife, Germaine Esau, the head chef at Cape Town’s award-winning Myoga restaurant, slices open a freshly caught tuna, tops it with seaweed and delivers his masterstroke: A sprinkling of sacred Baleni salt.</p>
      <p>“It’s like nothing you’ve tasted before,” he says. “It brings all the flavours out and just lifts everything.”</p>
      <p>Hand-harvested from the banks of a remote river in northwestern South Africa, Baleni salt is developing a growing culinary following, as much for its unique taste as its back story.</p>
      <p>The salt, say locals, is sanctified by the spirits of their ancestors, for the crystals come from the water of a holy spring said to have healing powers.</p>
      <p>Top chefs prize it for crystals that are tiny, evenly-sized and chunky and with an inimitable savour.</p>
      <p>“It gives quite a mineral taste to anything you do and it’s very salty, so a little goes a long way,” Esau said.</p>
      <p>Baleni salt is used in numerous luxury restaurants across Cape Town and Johannesburg, where it retails for 125 rand (RM34.16) per kilo.</p>
      <p>At the Myoga, Baleni salt became the salt of choice after the restaurant decided to phase out imported products and go for local sources.</p>
      <p>Replacing Maldon salt from England, Baleni salt is served in dainty ceramic bowls on every table inside the old English-style building built in 1800.</p>

      <p>“Everyone likes a story and there’s a great story behind the salt,” Esau said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sacred salt</b>
      </p>
      <p>That tale begins in Giyani, 2,000 kilometres from the coast, at a site on the banks of the Klein Letaba River in South Africa’s northern-most province of Limpopo.</p>
      <p>A trek through thick forest brings the visitor to a sort of oasis, fed by a river, amid tropical grasslands where, even in mid-winter, the temperature can reach 30 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>There, on winter mornings, elderly women from the local Tsonga community reach down to the earth, scraping up soil blanketed by a shiny white, thin crystallised deposit.</p>
      <p>“This is a sacred place, given to us by our ancestors,” said 73-year-old harvester Emelin Mathebula, teasing salty soil onto a metal plate with a steel rod.</p>
      <p>Before they begin their work, the women make offerings of tobacco, coins and mqombothi — a traditional sorghum malt beer — at the base of a nearby leadwood tree, to solicit the help of the spirits.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t start by asking, you stand a chance of not even getting any salt,” warned Ndaheni Mashele, 66, another harvester.</p>
      <p>“The sulphate water from the hot spring flows... the heat from the sun dries it, then we have this sort of salt there,” local guide Thinashaka Tshivhase told AFP.</p>
      <p>The harvesting is done only by women, who often camp in the dry river bed for weeks to make the most of the dry season before the spring rains fall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Healing power’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The spring is dubbed “kamkhulu” meaning “the place of the great one”. According to legend, the spirit of ancestors who first settled there give it its power.</p>
      <p>High in magnesium, chloride and other minerals, the water can treat high blood pressure and aching muscles, according to locals.</p>
      <p>The sick come and bathe in the spring for healing, while the healthy dip into the spring for good luck and prosperity.</p>

      <p>But the bathing is done under strict rules — one of which is a ban on sex for at least three days prior to going into the spring.</p>
      <p>One visitor, said Tshivhase, came to bathe in the spring and lied about his sexual activities.</p>
      <p>The man “felt his legs were burning and his bones were cracking because he was not clean when he came here”.</p>
      <p>According to Eleanor Muller, who heads a non-profit organisation Transfrontier Parks Destinations that helps the harvesters, archaeologists have confirmed that on that exact site, salt has been harvested using the same technique for the last 2,000 years.</p>
      <p>“The sacred salt has been a central point of importance for traditional healers in South Africa for centuries and still today,” Muller said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ancient harvesting method</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mathebula, a grandmother of eight, steps lithely along the riverbank filling her five-litre bucket with the crystal-infused soil.</p>
      <p>She then carries it up the river bank to filter it through her self-made filtration — a system using branches from the local mopane tree, clay, long grass and leaves.</p>
      <p>The liquid slowly drips through, landing in the bucket below.</p>
      <p>The concoction of river sand, salty soil and water is filtered up to four times until the colour of the water is almost clear.</p>
      <p>The liquid is left to boil over a small fire for four hours until the evaporating mixture begins to froth.</p>
      <p>When the foam hardens, it crystallises, forming the precious salt.</p>
      <p>Over the harvesting season, the grannies can pick up and process up to two tonnes of salt. Up to 80 kilos of the seasoning can be harvested in three days.</p>
      <p>The women sell the bulk of it to Muller’s NGO, which then sells it to a company called Oryx, which in turn retails it to top-end restaurants.</p>
      <p>“We are following the ways of harvesting the salt that we learnt from our grandparents,” Mathebula said.</p>
      <p>But passing down knowledge to the next generation is difficult, as many youngsters in the remote area migrate to the cities in search of work, she said. — AFP</p>
