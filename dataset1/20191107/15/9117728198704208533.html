        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> shared a special moment after the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a> and the German has admitted he's happy for Hamilton but insists he isn't content with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> being so far back.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton wrapped up a sixth Formula 1 World Championship at the Circuit of the Americas, P2 enough to beat <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> to the title. Hamilton has been a class above the rest of the field once again this season with his ten race wins more than double anyone else.</p>
      <p>Vettel and the Brit shared a moment before the podium in Austin and the four-time World Champion admitted he's happy for Hamilton but it isn't good seeing Ferrari so far back.</p>
      <p><i>"I think now is the time to write as many good things as you can,"</i> said Vettel as quoted by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/vettel-hamilton-deserves-success-sixth-title/4593919/">Motorsport</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think if somebody wins the title six times then he deserves all of it. That is what I told him as well.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I am happy for him. I am not happy that we are not in contention this year and we are so far back.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"We need to respect what he achieved the last years and also this year, plus together with his team how strong they have been. I am happy for him. But less happy for us."</i>
