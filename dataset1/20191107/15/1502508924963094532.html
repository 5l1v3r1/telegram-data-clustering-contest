      <h1>Global debt load surges to new all-time record high of $188 trn: IMF chief</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:50:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP | PTI</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/global-debt">global debt </a>load has surged to a new all-time record equivalent to more than double the world's economic output, IMF chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kristalina-georgieva">Kristalina Georgieva </a>warned Thursday.</p>
      <p>While private sector borrowing accounts for the vast majority of the total, the rise puts governments and individuals at risk if the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-economy-1160102.htm">economy </a>slows, she said. "<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/global-debt">Global debt </a>-- both public and private -- has reached an all-time high of $188 trillion.</p>
      <p>This amounts to about 230 per cent of world output," Georgieva said in a speech to open a two-day conference on debt.</p>
      <p>That is up from the previous record of $164 trillion in 2016, according to IMF figures.</p>
      <p>While interest rates remain low, borrowers can use debt to make investments in productive activities or weather a bout of low commodity prices.</p>
      <p>But it can become "a drag on growth," she said.</p>
      <p>"The bottom line is that high debt burdens have left many governments, companies, and households vulnerable to a sudden tightening of financial conditions," she cautioned.</p>
      <p>Corporate debt accounts for about two thirds of the total but government borrowing has risen as well in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-debt">Public debt </a>in advanced economies is at levels not seen since the Second World War," she warned. And "emerging market <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/public-debt">public debt </a>is at levels last seen during the 1980s debt crisis."<br/><br/>She called for steps to ensure "borrowing is more sustainable," including making lending practices more transparent and preparing for debt restructuring with "non-traditional lenders" -- an apparent reference to China, which has become a major creditor to developing nations including in Africa.</p>
