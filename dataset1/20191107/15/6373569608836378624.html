      <p>A film starring Stephen Fry is to be screened in Tavistock, where the director will also take part in a question and answer session.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow is a film that depicts the reality of PTSD and has a number of links to the South West.</p>
      <p>Stuart Brennan, lead producer of the film, is from Barnstaple and it also stars Joss Stone, who has spent large parts of her life in Devon.</p>
      <p>The story centres around Tesla, a military man who returns home to London after getting injured by an IED in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>He struggles to adapt to civilian life until he makes an unlikely friendship with a character called Sky.</p>
      <p>The story is based on experiences that many of the military go through and this special screening will also see various members of Help for Heroes and veterans take part in the Q&amp;A session alongside director Martha Pinson.</p>

      <p>Jock Easton, recovery manager at Help for Heroes’ recovery centre in Plymouth, said: “In the last 20 years, 40,000 people have been medically discharged from the British Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>“We want to make sure every wounded hero has the best opportunity to stand strong in civilian life.</p>
      <p>“Without public donations we wouldn’t be able to continue to do this so we are grateful to The Wharf and the Tomorrow producers for their support.”</p>
      <p>Tomorrow is Martha’s directorial debut but she has learnt from one of the best, having worked as the long-time script supervisor of Martin Scorsese.</p>
      <p>Also starring in the film is James Cosmo and Paul Kaye, who will be known for portraying Jeor Mormont and Thoros of Myr in HBO hit Game of Thrones, amongst other things.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Street, Sophie Kennedy Clark, Stephanie Leonidas and Will Tudor were also cast in the film.</p>
      <p>The screening takes place on Sunday, November 17 at The Wharf in Tavistock.</p>
      <p>The Q&amp;A session will begin at 2.30pm and the film will be shown shortly after that.</p>
