      <p>Ileana D’Cruz had closely guarded her relationship with Andrew Kneebone, sparingly dropping hints about their relationship. However this year the couple parted ways and seems like the actress is positively emerging from the heart-break.</p>
      <p>In an interview with a news portal, Ileana stated that after the break-up she went to a therapist who told her to accept the complements and that she is doing well now. While Ileana went on to accept that having a partner makes one calm and secure, the actress added that she is not ready for love. The ‘Rustom’ actress wished good for Andrew and stated that after the break-up, she didn’t curse him or think anything bad about him.</p>

But everybody who is involved in '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pati-Patni-Aur-Woh">Pati Patni Aur Woh</a>', does not belong to that school, does not belong to that thought process."</p>
