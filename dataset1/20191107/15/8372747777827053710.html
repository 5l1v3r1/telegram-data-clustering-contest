      <p>HANCOCK, Maine – A company in Maine is recalling cold smoked salmon that may be contaminated with <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>, a bacterium which is responsible for foodborne botulism, a form of food poisoning.</p>
      <p>Mill Stream Corp. (Sullivan Harbor Farm) announced the recall Wednesday and warned consumers not to consume the products even if they don’t look or smell spoiled.</p>
      <p>The smoked salmon was sold and distributed in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Utah, Iowa, Tennessee, Minnesota, Colorado, Florida, Arizona, Wisconsin, Washington, Georgia, Illinois, Virginia, Michigan, and Texas.</p>
      <p>The products were sold through retail, wholesale and online orders between March 6 and September 17, 2019 in vacuum sealed packages in the following sizes: whole salmon side, 2 lb., 1 lb., 8 oz., and 4 oz.</p>
