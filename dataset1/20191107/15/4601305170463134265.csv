This was just explained to him.



THIS was just explained to the President of the United States.
His tweet:
It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!
I keep thinking it can't get any more surreal and weird, and it does.
Every.
God.
Damned.
Day.
Lots of this today. The walls are closing in.
