Boko Haram kill Nigerian army in Borno
07 Nov 2019, 15:33 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

At least 10 Nigerian soldiers have been killed, while nine others have been injured in an ambush by suspected Boko Haram militants in northeastern Nigeria.

According to military sources, there are still 12 more soldiers missing following the attacks launched by the insurgents in Damboa, Borno State.
The source said the Bopko Haram fighters had ambushed the Nigerian army on their way back to their base in Damboa, 88 km from Maiduguri.
The military has been working in the area to control the insurgents.
Reports said the militants had burned five military vehicles and kidnapped six self-propelled grenades in two-hour attacks.
After more than a decade of fighting, Boko Haram has claimed the lives of 35,000 people, and about 2 million have lost their lives, causing them to seek refuge in neighboring countries including Niger and Cameroon.
