有日一位小姐睇完醫生，出藥時佢問我:「可唔可以寫多幾張病假紙俾我呀？」我：「幾張？一模一樣嘅？」

小姐一次過要7張病假紙
佢：「係呀，我要嚟交返俾公司！」你同時打緊幾多份工呀？我：「你有好多間公司？你要幾多張呀？我要幫你問問醫生先⋯⋯」佢喺度數手指：「半打啦，半打都夠。」我覺得好不可思議，真心求教：「你點樣同時間返六份工呀？唔係，加埋原本呢張，應該係七份工？」佢：「唔係呀，我返一份工咋嘛！」我：「咁你要七張病假紙嘅？」佢：「我公司有七個人。」⋯⋯你每人都要派一張病假紙呀？派帖都係派俾一家之主,搵個代表收啫~我：「公司嘅話，應該交一張俾HR就夠啦，唔駛個個都俾，啲同事唔關事嘅更加唔駛。」
佢：「我要話俾全世界知我拎SL啫，廢事佢哋煩我呀！」我：「或者你EMAIL俾佢哋咪得囉？咁唔駛醫生寫咁多張嘛！」佢：「我而家冇俾錢醫生咩？我要多幾張都唔得咩？」我都幾肯定如果你要醫生寫多六張，醫生一係發脾氣，一係就發住脾氣咁收你額外費用。我：「我可以幫你問醫生嘅，不過因為你要嘅係多過我哋原本應該提供俾你嘅，係有機會收取你額外費用，或者你會唔會考慮自己拎去影印呀？或者影相咪算囉？唔係交俾HR做請假用途嘅話，可以唔駛咁正式喎！」佢諗咗陣再講：「我本身已經有幫襯啦喎，要收幾多呀？幾蚊就當跌咗啦我！」
我：「一定唔止幾蚊啦，你真係要醫生寫？要嘅話我而家幫你問醫生！」佢諗多諗：「寫幾隻字都咁難為你哋就唔好啦！我從來都唔鍾意勉強人，係咁啦！」佢嬲爆爆俾錢離開診所。
