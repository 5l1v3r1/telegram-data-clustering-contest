      <h1>Former Plymouth Argyle manager Derek Adams appointed as Morecambe boss</h1>
      <h2>The 44-year-old has been out of football since his dismissal by the Pilgrims at the end of April</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:10:49+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Former promotion-winning Plymouth Argyle boss Derek Adams is back in football management - with the Pilgrims' League Two rivals Morecambe.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old takes over at Morecambe on a contract until the summer of 2022 after the long-serving Jim Bentley was lured away by ambitious National League club AFC Fylde.</p>
      <p>Adams has been out of management since his dismissal by Argyle following a 5-1 drubbing at Accrington Stanley on April 27.</p>
      <p>Morecambe are currently bottom of League Two, below Stevenage on goal difference so the task for Adams is obvious - to keep the Shrimps in the EFL.</p>
      <p>The Shrimps are away to League One outfit Blackpool int he FA Cup first round on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Adams will be at the match but caretaker bosses Kevin Ellison and Barry Roche will take charge of the team.</p>
      <p>In the not too distant future is the prospect of Adams returning to Home Park with Morecambe on Saturday, December 14.</p>
      <p>That is set to see the redeveloped Mayflower Grandstand open for a league game for the first time, albeit at 50 per cent of its' 5,403-seat capacity.</p>
      <p>The return match will be at the Globe Arena on Saturday, March 14.</p>
