      <p>SEOUL: South Korea expelled on Thursday (Nov 7) two North Korean fishermen suspected of killing 16 colleagues before crossing the border into the South last week, South Korea's Unification Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The two men, both in their 20s, breached the inter-Korean maritime frontier into the South aboard a squid fishing boat on Saturday and South Korean authorities detained them for questioning, ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min said.</p>

      <p>The authorities concluded after their investigation that the men had fled to the South after killing 16 other men on the vessel, Lee said.</p>
      <p>"The government decided to expel them as they had committed grave, non-political crimes such as murder and were not subject to our protection under the law," Lee told a briefing.</p>
      <p>Lee did not elaborate on why or how the two men had killed their colleagues.</p>
      <p>They were handed over at the border village of Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone dividing the two Koreas, Lee said.Â </p>
