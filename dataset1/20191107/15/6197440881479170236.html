      <h1>Google Store ad suggests $200 off Pixel 4 on Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:55:55+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>After last year, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/11/28/comment-google-pixel-launch-buy/">waiting for the holiday season</a> to buy the latest Made by Google phone is advisable. A Google Store ad today suggests that the Pixel 4 on Black Friday and Cyber Monday will be $200 off.</p>
      <p>According to one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dsy8jg/pixel_4_bfcm_price_leaked_via_google_ad_200_off/">Redditor</a> that encountered a Google Store ad, the “Pixel 4 &amp; 4 XL are $200 off.” This “Save on Google Pixel 4” banner notes how you can “Shop the deal through 12/2,” which implies one deal starting on Black Friday (or earlier) and lasting into the weekend until Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 Black Friday ad implies that all models will be discounted by $200. In this scenario, the 64 GB Pixel 4 is $599 and 128 GB is $699, while the Pixel 4 XL starts at $699 and goes to $799. Clearly White and Just Black will be available, but it’s not clear if the the “limited” stock of Oh So Orange will last.</p>
      <p>This possible Pixel 4 Black Friday will likely cause another uproar among early Made by Google adopters. Assuming the $200 deal is across the line, this is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/11/16/google-store-black-friday-pixel-3/">more generous</a> than last year where the identically priced Pixel 3 was discounted by $150 and the Pixel 3 XL by $200.</p>

      <p>In 2018, there was even an early Black Friday promo that saw buying a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL at full price and getting a second phone at up to 50% off. Meanwhile, pre-orders this year will receive a $100 Google Store credit, though it’s not yet available.</p>
