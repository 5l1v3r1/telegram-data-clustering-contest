      <h1>Nolte: Snopes Confirms Dems Tried to Impeach Every Elected GOP President Since Eisenhower</h1>
      <h2>The fake, far-left fact check site Snopes accidentally confirmed that Democrats have sought to impeach every elected Republican president since <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-impeach-gop-presidents/">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:58:11+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">John Nolte</a></address>
      <p>Naturally, while confirming this, the garbage fire of fake news that is Snopes rated what is “mostly true” as “mostly false.”</p>
      <p>The claim is: “Have Democrats Tried to Impeach Every GOP President Since Ike?”</p>
      <p>Snopes decided to fact check this claim based on a popular meme that shows a black and white photo of Gen. Eisenhower above a caption that reads “INTERESTING FACT!!! Did you know Democrats have tried to impeach every Republican President since Eisenhower???”</p>
      <p>Looking to debunk this mostly true claim, Snopes accidentally confirms that Democrats have indeed tried to impeach every <i>elected</i> Republican president since Eisenhower [emphasis mine]:</p>
      <blockquote>The U.S. has had six republican presidents since Eisenhower left office in 1961: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. The claim is wrong on its face because <b>Democrats made no effort to impeach Ford</b>. While a handful of <b>Democratic lawmakers have introduced articles of impeachment against five of the last six Republican presidents</b>, in most cases these efforts weren’t taken seriously by the party at large. Nixon and Trump have been the only Republican presidents since Ike who have faced a serious threat of impeachment.</blockquote>
      <p>So, Snopes has indeed confirmed that Democrats have “introduced articles of impeachment against five of the last six Republican presidents,” the sole exception being Gerald Ford, who was not elected.</p>
      <p>Ford was not even elected to the vice presidency; he was appointed by Nixon after his original vice president, Spiro Agnew, resigned in disgrace over a matter that had nothing to do with Watergate.</p>
      <p>What’s more, Ford was president for only a little more than two years.</p>
      <p>But there you have it — confirmation from a left-wing fact check site that Democrats sought to impeach five of the last six Republican presidents and sought to impeach every Republican <i>elected</i> to the presidency since Eisenhower.</p>
      <p>Granted, the meme that claims Democrats tried to impeach <i>every</i> president since Ike is not 100 percent accurate. But after Snopes confirmed the meme was 5/6th correct, why is a mostly accurate claim hit with a verdict of “mostly false”?</p>
      <p>I think we all know the answer to that one…</p>
      <p>Because it is a damning fact that proves just how anti-democratic the Democrats are, what a bunch of sore losers they are, and Snopes is not a real fact-checking site, it is a Palace Guard for the political left.</p>
      <p>So Snopes splits hairs between what it describes as “serious” impeachment efforts and efforts that never went beyond a lawmaker introducing articles of impeachment.</p>
      <p>So what we have here is Snopes making a subjective opinion about what “tried to impeach every elected Republican president since Eisenhower” means — and wouldn’t you know it? — Snopes’s subjective opinion falls right into the category of aiding and abetting the left.</p>
      <p>But by any objective, pro-science standard, the meme in question is MOSTLY TRUE.</p>
      <p>Regardless, we should at least thank Snopes for doing the hard work that proves for a fact the following…</p>
      <p>
        <i>Democrats Have Tried to Impeach Every Elected GOP President Since Eisenhower…</i>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks, Snopes!!!</p>
