      <p>Google play - the official app store for Android apps on Google is facing the wrath of social media users after the app “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201808091067077947-india-uk-khalistan-protest/">2020 Sikh Referendum</a>” was made available for download by users.</p>
      <p>Social media users were miffed after coming across the app, listed on the Play Store as already having more than 1,000 downloads, and slammed the tech giant for allowing the radical extremist movement to be on its platform.</p>
      <blockquote>The free app asks its members to join their team 2020 for a “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201908131076538279-twitter-erupts-as-british-indian-rapper-posts-controversial-video-in-support-of-khalistani-movement/">Punjab Independence Referendum</a>”, with 27 countries, including the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and Pakistan, listed amongst others.</blockquote>
      <p>Several people have called it anti-India propaganda, while urging others to report it as “inappropriate” to have it taken down.</p>

      <p>India’s Union Cabinet on 17 July 2019 banned "<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201907191076285052-british-indian-rapper-sparks-row-after-joining-controversial-sikh-group/">Sikhs for Justice"</a>, the separatist group, on the grounds of secessionism and carrying out alleged anti-national activities.</p>
      <p>Recently, literature on Ghazwa-e-Hind, translated as “Holy War Against India” was also made available on Play Store. It is a term allegedly mentioned in an Islamic book saying that India will be conquered by Islamic forces.</p>
