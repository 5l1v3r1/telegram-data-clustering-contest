      <p>So far we’ve heard two songs from Mura Masa’s upcoming album <i>R.Y.C.</i>, which stands for Raw Youth Collage. Clairo handled lead vocals on the phenomenal lead single “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2055500/mura-masa-i-dont-think-i-can-do-this-again-feat-clairo-video/video/">I Don’t Think I Can Do This Again</a>,” while Mura Masa himself grabbed the mic on “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062819/mura-masa-no-hope-generation/music/">No Hope Generation</a>.” Today, we get to hear what he’s cooked up with slowthai, the provocative young UK rapper who’s beed making a name for himself with stunts like <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2042459/slowthai-nothing-great-about-britain/video/">calling the Queen a cunt</a> on his album’s title track and <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058844/slowthai-mercury-prize-boris-johnson/video/">staging a fake Boris Johnson beheading</a> at the Mercury Prize ceremony.</p>
      <p>Mura Masa and slowthai’s song together is called “Deal Wiv It.” They spelled it that way because they are British — deal wiv it. (Very meta!) It’s a bouncy little rock-inflected rap song — or is it a rap-inflected rock song? Like most slowthai tracks, it reminds me of the Streets. Like most Mura Masa tracks, it feels like a whole music festival distilled into one sleek, multifarious whole.</p>
      <p>“Deal Wiv It” arrives with a video directed by Yoni Lappin, which you can watch below.</p>
