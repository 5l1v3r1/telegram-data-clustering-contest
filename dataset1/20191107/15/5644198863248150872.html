      <p>SINGAPORE: A man who stole S$12,000 worth of valuables from his father-in-law got a divorce and a fine for his actions.</p>
      <p>Sylvester See Sheng Sen, 27, was fined S$8,000 on Thursday (Nov 7) for one count of theft, with a second count taken into consideration during sentencing.</p>

      <p>The court heard that the sales associate was at his father-in-law's Serangoon flat on Apr 10 last year when he decided to steal some valuables.</p>
      <p>He had seen his 61-year-old father-in-law keep the key to his drawer in a bag in the living room.</p>
      <p>He searched the bag, retrieved the key and went to his father-in-law's bedroom. He unlocked a drawer with the key, where he found another key with the Chinese word for "safe" on it.</p>
      <p>See unlocked the safe in the room with the key, and found an assortment of jewellery inside. </p>
      <p>He took S$12,000 worth of items including gold chains, bangles and S$2,000 in cash.</p>
      <p>See then returned the keys to their original places and went back to his own flat with his three-year-old son.</p>
      <p>His father-in-law realised that the jewellery was missing and made a police report on Apr 22 last year.</p>
      <p>See was arrested on May 2 and investigations revealed that he had pawned some of the valuables at a pawn shop in Bedok for about half their value. </p>
      <p>He later went back and redeemed the items as he felt guilty. All the items were recovered from his Woodlands flat.</p>
      <p>See's defence lawyer told the court that his client's wife divorced him over the offences.</p>
      <p>The lawyer said See always intended to return the items, and never planned to "cause any permanent loss". He has also made full restitution, and compensated his father-in-law an additional S$3,000 as a gesture of his remorse.</p>
      <p>"Our client has suffered greatly," said the lawyer. "He cannot see his four-year-old son regularly. He has also lost his matrimonial flat."</p>
      <p>For theft, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined or both.</p>
