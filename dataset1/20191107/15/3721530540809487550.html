      <p>As DC Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/22/17600376/snyder-cut-san-diego-comic-con-zack-snyder-joss-whedon-dc-warner-bros">Snyderverse</a> dissipates, the latest take on the caped crusader is on the horizon. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/24/16199426/batman-matt-reeves-dc-warner-bros"><i>The Batman</i></a> comes from <i>Cloverfield</i> and <i>War for the Planet of the Apes</i> director Matt Reeves. And with a release date set for 2021, the reboot is slowly but surely amassing a cast.</p>
      <p>Originally, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/30/18204607/ben-affleck-new-batman-movie-release-date">Ben Affleck was set to direct and star in the film</a>, but thanks to scheduling and development hell, the Bat-fleck take of the movie was shelved. Goodbye Affleck, hello Reeves.</p>
      <p>Unlike <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/3/20893138/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-robert-de-niro-todd-phillips">this October’s <i>Joker</i></a>, which set itself separate from <i>Aquaman</i>, <i>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice</i>, and the ever-changing DC Extended Universe, <i>The Batman</i> is expected to be part of the DCEU, though only through small connections. It won’t be an origin story, either, said Reeves and instead will be a “noir-driven” original story</p>
      <h3>So who’s cast in the movie?</h3>

      <h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/14/20914529/batman-zoe-kravitz-catwoman-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves"><b>Robert Pattinson</b></a> as Bruce Wayne/Batman</h3>
      <p>We learned that RPattz would take up the cowl last May. <i>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</i> ‘s Nicholas Hoult was reportedly up for the role, but Pattinson beat him out. The English actor was Reeves’ first choice for the role. In addition to playing Edward Cullen in the Twilight saga, Pattinson also has a robust filmography of independent movies. Most recently, he starred in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/19/18631577/the-lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-cannes-2019">indie horror flick <i>The Lighthouse.</i></a></p>
      <h3>Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon</h3>
      <p>Wright will play the steadfast Gotham police commissioner, a role Gary Oldman and J.K. Simmons have also played. The <i>Westworld</i> actor also appeared in the Hunger Games as District 3 tribute Beetee.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/14/20914529/batman-zoe-kravitz-catwoman-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves"><b>Zoë Kravitz</b></a> as Selina Kyle/Catwoman</h3>
      <p>Kravitz follows a long line of totally awesome Catwoman actresses, including Eartha Kitt, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Anne Hathaway. She played Leta Lestrange in<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/8/18072518/fantastic-beasts-crimes-of-grindelwald-review"><i>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</i></a>, but was killed off at the end of the movie so she doesn’t have any outstanding Wizarding World commitments. Incidentally, Kravitz also voiced Catwoman in <i>The Lego Batman Movie.</i></p>
      <h3>Paul Dano as Edward Nashton/The Riddler</h3>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> is rumored to have six villains. Six! The next addition to the rogue’s gallery is Paul Dano, who is reportedly playing the Riddler.</p>
      <h3>But Jonah Hill is NOT the Penguin</h3>
      <p>Hill was in the talks to appear in <i>The Batman</i>, reportedly as either the Penguin or Riddler, but that didn’t pan out. Alas! But fret not because...</p>
      <h3>Colin Farrell as the Penguin!</h3>
      <p>Might be an odd casting choice considering the last onscreen Penguin was played by Danny Devito (who incidentally was in 2019’s <i>Dumbo</i> with Farrell), but hey! We’ll take it.</p>
      <h3>Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth</h3>
      <p>You may know Serkis as Gollum. Or maybe as Caesar from Reeves’ Apes films. Or maybe as Ulysses Klaue in <i>Age of Ultron</i> and <i>Black Panther</i>. Or as the upcoming director of <i>Venom 2</i>. One thing’s for certain — Serkis will have a distinct take on Batman’s beloved butler.</p>
      <h3>Michael Giacchino will score the film</h3>
      <p>You may know Giacchino from the Pixar soundtracks, most notably <i>The Incredibles</i> (and its sequel), <i>Ratatouille</i>, and Up. Giacchino also did the scores for the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, <i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</i>, and <i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</i> among others.</p>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> is set to swoop into theaters on a June 25, 2021.</p>
