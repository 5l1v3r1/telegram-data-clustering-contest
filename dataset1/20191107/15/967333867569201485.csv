The free app asks its members to join their team 2020 for a “Punjab Independence Referendum”, with 27 countries, including the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and Pakistan, listed amongst others.
Several people have called it anti-India propaganda, while urging others to report it as “inappropriate” to have it taken down.


















India’s Union Cabinet on 17 July 2019 banned ""Sikhs for Justice"", the separatist group, on the grounds of secessionism and carrying out alleged anti-national activities.
