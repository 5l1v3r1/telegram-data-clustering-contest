Twitter user Namio’s hobby isn’t just knitting, but knitting woolen Gundam helmets.
It took days to knit each helmet. The RX-178 Gundam Mk-II helmet, for example, took four days, with Namio knitting morning to night for two of those. The result is glorious. Perfect for winter, too. 









Yes, that’s a knitted face mask. With the helmet, apparently it’s very warm—hot, even.



And when the helmet is not being worn, it’s perfect for bewildering cats.
