      <h1>'MADE UP': Trump denies story claiming he asked Barr to hold news conference</h1>

      <p>President Trump denied reporting yesterday by the <i>Washington Post</i> that he had asked Attorney General William Barr to hold a press conference to deny any wrongdoing in a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 phone call</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>In a Thursday morning tweet, Trump chided the newspaper for not sourcing their story. "The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference," he said. "Never happened, and there were no sources!"</p>
      <p>[<b>READ:</b> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-wanted-barr-to-publicly-declare-he-broke-no-laws-in-call-with-ukrainian-president">Trump wanted Barr to publicly declare he broke no laws in call with Ukrainian president</a>]</p>

      <p>The story from the <i>Washington Post </i>cited "people familiar with the matter" as the source for their story, saying they knew that Barr had declined a request from the president to hold the press conference.</p>
      <p>Trump also repeated a request to review the phone call transcript, which has been made public, and he has described as a "perfect phone call" with the Ukrainian leader. Critics of the president and House Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">pursuing impeachment</a> over the call insist that Trump attempted to initiate a quid pro quo with Zelensky by withholding military aid unless Ukraine investigated Joe and Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>"Read the transcript!" Trump said on Twitter shortly after denying the story about the press conference.</p>

      <p>Sources also told the <i>Post</i> that Trump had complained about Barr's reported refusal to publicly deny wrongdoing but that two remained on good terms.</p>
      <p>The White House denied that Trump had requested Barr hold such a press conference in a statement on Wednesday. "The President has nothing but respect for AG Barr and greatly appreciates the work he’s done on behalf of the country — and no amount of shady sources with clear intent to divide, smear, and slander will change that," said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.</p>
