Watch: Akshay Kumar heads out for a movie date with daughter Nitara
07 Nov 2019, 15:21 by TIMESOFINDIA.COM
Akshay Kumar may be busy with his many film commitments, but that did not stop him from spending a quiet evening at the movies with his daughter Nitara.
The father-daughter duo was spotted arriving at a theatre in the city to enjoy a movie together. While Akki looked dashing in a crisp white shirt and black pants, Nitara looked adorable in her floral dress.
The doting dad even managed to keep the shutterbugs at bay and even tricked a few by opting to take the stairs instead of the elevator.









Akshay is currently juggling his time between three films. He is shooting for ‘Sooryavanshi’ with director Rohit Shetty, apart from also awaiting the release of his next film ‘Laxmmi Bomb’ that is now set to release on Eid 2020. He is also expected to kickstart work on his period film ‘Prithviraj’.
