      <p>THIS was just explained to the President of the United States.</p>
      <p>His tweet:</p>
      <blockquote>It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER &amp; NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!</blockquote>
      <p>I keep thinking it can't get any more surreal and weird, and it does.</p>
      <p>Every.</p>
      <p>God.</p>
      <p>Damned.</p>
      <p>Day.</p>
      <p>Lots of this today. The walls are closing in.</p>
