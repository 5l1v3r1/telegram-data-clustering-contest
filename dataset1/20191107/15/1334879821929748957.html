      <p>Do you want to be able to make healthy meals on a weeknight, but feel like it just takes too long?</p>
      <p>This is where pressure cooker meals come to the rescue! With an electric pressure cooker, like an Instant Pot, you can make meals a lot faster than on the stove or in the oven. You also just set the time, and let it do its thing while you do yours, until you hear the beep.</p>
      <p>Taking advantage of this time-saving device to make healthy meals is easy, but it’s hard to know where to start in searching through all of the recipes online. It takes forever to browse around and find something you want to make.</p>
      <p>Let’s get you started with 27 easy recipes for healthy pressure cooker meals you can make this week – along with some info on why they’re healthy to motivate you to make them.</p>
      <h3>1. Chipotle Burrito Bowls</h3>

      <p>Adding sweet potatoes and a little splash of maple syrup and bourbon takes an already delicious chili to the next level.

This recipe pairs slightly sweet butternut squash and earthy sage for a perfect fall meal.</p>
