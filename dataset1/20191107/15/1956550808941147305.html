      <p>One of Abu Dhabi’s <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/gallery/402763-in-pictures-abu-dhabis-qasr-al-sarab-desert-resort">most impressive hotels</a> is about to celebrate a milestone.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/travel/features/12528-qasr-al-sarab">Qasr Al Sarab Desert Resort by Anantara is celebrating its tenth birthday</a> with some new experiences for guests.<br/><br/>Head down to the desert retreat, through he stunning dunes along the way, and you can try something a little bit different to your standard staycation (it was voted the <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/hotels/410410-get-a-discount-stay-in-abu-dhabi-at-the-worlds-most-instagrammable-hotel">most-insatgrammable hotel in the world</a> earlier this year, after all).<br/><br/>To celebrate, the resort has launched the Bedouin Night Camping Experience. You can choose to arrive at the outdoor camping site by camel ride or by hitching a ride in a 4x4. Once at the site, a majlis will welcome you where you can enjoy some dates and Arabic coffee before checking into your camp room overlooking the dunes.<br/><br/>While you’re there you can also have an authentic Emirati meal, watch falconry shows and try activities including archery and dune bashing.<br/><br/>We don’t know about you but a night under the stars away from the busy city is sounding pretty good right about now.<br/><i>Prices vary.
