Claudio Borghi, the former World Cup winner with Argentina who now works in the media, has said that River Plate coach Marcelo Gallardo could replace Ernesto Valverde in December.
Reports in Argentina continue to suggest that Gallardo is a Barça target, despite the fact Barcelona and people close to Lionel Messi have denied any interest in pushing for the coach.
Barça say they have not made any contact with the Argentine or his people, while Messi's people say the forward has not asked for Gallardo to replace Valverde.
The latest to comment on the situation is Borghi, who said: ""Gallardo could be the coach of Barcelona in December, per information I have. He is one of the best coaches in the world.
""[River Plate president Rodolfo] D'Onofrio said he'd only leave by quitting his post, but I know this from a direct source.""
Valverde has been in charge since 2017 and has a contract until 2021. He has won La Liga in each of the last two seasons but Champions League disappointment and recent results have seen the pressure go.
