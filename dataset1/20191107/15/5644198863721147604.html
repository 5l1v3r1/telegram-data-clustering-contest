      <p>China and the United States must simultaneously cancel some existing tariffs on each other's goods for both sides to reach a "phase one" trade deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>BEIJING: China and the United States have agreed in the past two weeks to cancel tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war in different phases, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>China and the United States must simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other's goods for both sides to reach a "phase one" trade deal, said Gao Feng, spokesman at the commerce ministry.</p>

      <p>The tariff cancellation is an important condition for there to be any agreement, he said at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>The proportion of tariffs cancelled must be the same, and how many tariffs should be cancelled can be negotiated, Gao told reporters.</p>
      <p>"The trade war started with tariffs, and should end with the cancellation of tariffs," Gao told reporters.</p>
      <p>He did not give a timeline.</p>
      <p>A source previously told Reuters that Chinese negotiators wanted the United States to drop 15per cent tariffs on about US$125 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect on Sept. 1.</p>
      <p>They are also seeking relief from earlier 25per cent tariffs on about US$250 billion of imports from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.</p>
      <p>A person familiar with China's negotiating position said it was pressing Washington to "remove all tariffs as soon as possible".</p>
      <p>A deal may be signed this month by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a yet-to-be determined location.</p>
      <p>Dozens of venues have been suggested for a meeting, which had originally been scheduled to take place on the sidelines of a now-cancelled mid-November summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, a senior official of the Trump administration told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>One possible location was London, where the two leaders could meet after a NATO summit that Trump is due to attend from Dec. 3-4, the official said.</p>
      <p>Gao declined to say when and where such a meeting could be.</p>
