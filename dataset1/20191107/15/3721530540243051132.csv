Netflix holiday specials already gave us modern day prince and princess switcheroos. The next logical, totally reasonable step in this progression: roping in some knights. But not just some modern stately officials from an imaginary tiny European country— nay! Netflix has decided to bring-eth a real bonafide medieval knight to bless Vanessa Hudgens’ holiday season.
Enter The Knight Before Christmas! Because there’s that poem called “The Night Before Christmas” and the guy in this movie is an actual knight? And it happens before and around Christmas? Genius!
Want even more Netflix holiday specials?Check out the full slate of Christmas programming Let’s get merry!
Regular ol’ science teacher Brooke (Vanessa Hudgens) finds a very confused man who talks like he’s a Medieval Times actor. Except, he’s actually from the medieval times. Brooke thinks Cole (Josh Whitehouse from Poldark) is just a regular amnesia patient, so against the judgement of literally everyone in her life, she decides to take him in for the holidays.
Because this is a Christmas movie, the two bond, find joy in the holidays, and will most likely fall head over heels for each other by the time Dec. 25 rolls around. Expect wonderful, gooey, marshmallow-y fluff, perfect as an accompaniment to a mug of hot cocoa.
The Knight Before Christmas rides onto Netflix on Nov. 21.
