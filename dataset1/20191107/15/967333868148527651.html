        <b>BANGKOK (Sputnik) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah has rejected US State Secretary Mike Pompeo's suggestion that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in January be held in the United States now that Chile had pulled out of its hosting role.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"The US is thinking of hosting APEC somewhere in January in the US but I have informed the American officials while they were in Bangkok that we don't think it is a good idea", Abdullah told reporters, as quoted by The Star news outlet.</blockquote>
      <p>The foreign minister did not provide details as to why he rejected the proposal.</p>
      <p>The statement comes after Chilean President Sebastian Pinera cancelled the 2-day summit, scheduled to start on 16 November, last week amid <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911021077205211-thousands-of-protesters-gather-in-central-santiago-police-use-tear-gas---reports/">ongoing protests in the South American country</a>.</p>
      <p>Abdullah said Pompeo had called him while in Bangkok to ask for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910311077186054-chile-says-to-share-achievements-in-preparing-for-apec-forum-with-next-host-malaysia/">Malaysia's stance on hosting the event</a>.</p>
      <p>Malaysia is due to host next year's APEC summit.</p>
      <p>APEC is a regional economic forum that aims to strengthen regional economic integration among its 21 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</p>
