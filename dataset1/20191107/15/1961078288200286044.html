      <h1>Chicago Police Superintendent to Announce Retirement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:49:24+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Mitch Smith</a></address>
      <p>CHICAGO — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/us/eddie-johnson-new-chicago-police-leader-has-deep-roots-in-a-city-adrift-in-turmoil.html?module=inline">Eddie Johnson</a>, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/us/rahm-emanuel-chicago-interim-police-chief-eddie-johnson.html?module=inline">took over</a> Chicago’s police department at a time of cratering public confidence and a spike in homicides, will announce his retirement on Thursday. Superintendent Johnson, a native of Chicago who spent his entire career in the department, stabilized a city and a department that were in crisis after the murder of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/laquan-mcdonald-van-dyke-trial.html?module=inline">Laquan McDonald</a>, a black teenager who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/laquan-mcdonald-van-dyke.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer">shot 16 times</a> by a white officer.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Johnson was scheduled to hold a news conference with Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Thursday morning. His decision to retire was confirmed by Anthony Guglielmi, a Police Department spokesman.</p>

      <p>Chicago becomes the latest in a series of large cities this year to see turnover at the top of its police department. The Philadelphia police commissioner <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/philadelphia-police-commissioner-resigns.html?module=inline">abruptly resigned</a> in August, the chief in <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article235882902.html">Charlotte, N.C.</a>, announced plans to step down and a new commissioner was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/nyregion/nypd-commissioner-james-oneill-resigns.html?module=inline">appointed this week</a> in New York City.</p>
      <p>During more than three years in charge of the country’s second-largest municipal police force, Superintendent Johnson led an overhaul in training, introduced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/chicago-police-force-shooting.html?module=inline">more restrictive rules</a> for when officers could use force and guided the department into a court-enforced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/us/chicago-police-consent-decree.html?module=inline">consent decree</a>. After a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/04/us/chicago-shootings.html?module=inline">dramatic rise in homicides</a> early in his tenure, the murder rate had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/fbi-crime-data.html?module=inline">steadily dropped</a>.</p>
      <p>But the superintendent faced mounting problems, especially in recent weeks. He requested an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/us/chicago-Eddie-Johnson-sleeping-car.html?module=inline">investigation of himself</a> last month after being found asleep in a parked S.U.V. late at night. Superintendent Johnson blamed the episode on medication, but Chicago’s <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/18/20921395/supt-eddie-johnson-couple-of-drinks-dinner-slumping-over-car-mayor-says">mayor later said</a> he had been drinking that evening. Days later, the superintendent lost a <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/23/20929379/fop-issues-no-confidence-vote-eddie-johnson">vote of no-confidence</a> by leaders of the city’s main police union.</p>
      <p>The superintendent’s departure leaves the city and its new mayor, Ms. Lightfoot, facing difficult choices on what type of leader to select for a department that has faced intense criticism over crime levels but also distrust from residents.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004057511/video-of-teen-shot-by-police-released.html?module=inline">video</a> of the shooting of Laquan McDonald was released in late 2015, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/us/chicago-officer-charged-in-death-of-black-teenager-official-says.html?module=inline">protesters marched</a> for weeks, the city’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/us/chicago-police-rahm-emanuel-laquan-mcdonald.html?module=inline">top police official was fired</a> and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/us/chicago-police-superintendent.html?module=inline">national search</a> for a new superintendent ended with a political stalemate. Superintendent Johnson had not applied for the top job, but eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/us/rahm-emanuel-chicago-interim-police-chief-eddie-johnson.html?module=inline">was tapped</a>.</p>
