      <p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (KABC) -- Dylan Short's journey of healing continues one year since <a href="https://abc7.com/thousand-oaks-survivor-i-heard-somebody-yell-hes-reloading/4649166/">surviving last year's mass shooting</a> at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks.<br/><br/>"I'd be a liar if I told you it was easy, it's not easy for anybody," Short said.<br/><br/>The 25-year-old is now 65 pounds lighter. His injuries and the entire experience pushed him to lead a healthier lifestyle. While he's improved physically, he's also made emotional progress. He says his recovery and healing process was put to the test shortly after the shooting.<br/><br/>"I walked into the most crowded bar I could find, walked in, got myself in the middle of the group where there was no exit planning for myself. Nothing. And basically took the feeling as much as I could head on," he said.<br/><br/>A mixture of anger, sadness and anxiety came bubbling up to the surface.<br/><br/>"It was a very challenging thing for me to do, but it was probably the best thing I ever did," he said.<br/><br/>For Short, other therapy has included listening to fireworks and dealing with loud sounds.<br/><br/>He says the shooting has been a motivator to live life and follow his dreams. He's also now more invested in his passion for motorcycles.<br/><br/>His advice for other survivors is to face your fears.<br/><br/>"Sometimes after the craziest, most screwed up things in your life, you end up going through some of the happiest and wildest and fun times that you'll ever have in a lifetime."</p>
