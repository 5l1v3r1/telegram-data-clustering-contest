      <h1>Dow jumps 250 points on trade deal optimism</h1>
      <h2>Chinese official: Tariff roll-backs discussed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:15:24+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Anneken Tappe, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - It could be another record-breaking day in the US stock market, after a Chinese official said that Washington and Beijing have discussed rolling back tariffs.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce told reporters these roll-backs could happen even before a "phase one" trade deal is signed. The United States and China agreed a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/politics/donald-trump-china-trade-negotiations-october-deal/index.html">preliminary deal in mid-October</a>.</p>
      <p>Investor sentiment rebounded on the back of the comments. On Wednesday, markets were more or less flat after a Reuters report warned that the signing of the preliminary agreement could be delayed.</p>
      <p>The Dow was up nearly 250 points, or 0.9%, around midday, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.5%. Both indexes opened at fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%, and also hit a trading record high within the first half hour of the market opened.</p>
      <p>Gains were broad across industries, with only five Dow stocks trading in the red. Tech, energy and industrials stocks were best-performing in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
      <p>"For almost two years now, the US/China trade tussle has posed the biggest headwind to global growth. But with promising signs of progress on the trade front, a shift in global central banks to easing (including three consecutive rate cuts by the Fed this year), and mostly better-than-expected corporate profits, US stocks were pushed to all-time highs," wrote Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, economic analyst at BMO.</p>
      <p>All three major stock indexes could close at fresh record highs on Thursday. It would be the third record of the week for the Dow and the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>Safe haven assets like Treasury bonds and gold, which increase in appeal during times of uncertainty and volatility, are down on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 10-year Treasury yield is up at 1.942%, implying weaker demand for the government bond. Its the highest yield 14 weeks, according to Refinitiv. Bond yields and prices move opposite to one another.</p>
      <p>Gold prices dropped 0.6%, to $1,481.70 an ounce.</p>
