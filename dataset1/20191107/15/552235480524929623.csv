A search has been launched for a missing man who vanished from his home in Perth .
Concerns are growing for Colin White who was last seen at the ASDA on Dunkeld Road around 4pm on Tuesday November 5.
The alarm was raised when the 35-year-old failed to show up to work despite saying that is where he was heading.

Constable Rory Miller, Perth Police Station, said: “Colin has never been missing before.
""It was when he didn’t turn up for work on Tuesday – after saying that was where he was heading – that the alarm was raised.
“Colin has worked all over the Highlands and Islands and we have been in touch with previous employers but unfortunately no one has heard from or seen him.
“He drives a silver Ford Fiesta SW04KUF and this car was on the A82 heading towards Invergarry around 4.15 am on Wednesday morning.
“We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen Colin, or maybe knows where he is, to get in touch. His family are very concerned for him.
 
“We would also ask Colin to call us or his family to let everyone know he is ok.”
