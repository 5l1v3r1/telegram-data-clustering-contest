That compared with a profit of $194 million or 32 cents per diluted share a year ago.
Revenue totalled $1.59 billion, down from nearly $1.61 billion.
On an adjusted basis, Hydro One says it earned 40 cents per share for the quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 38 cents per share a year ago.

""Our main focus has been and will remain operational excellence as we continue to drive performance,"" Hydro One chief executive Mark Poweska said in a statement.
