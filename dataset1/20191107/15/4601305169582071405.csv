Mangoes spilling from an overturned tractor trailer caused a messy morning commute on Maryland beltway.
The mango truck overturned early Wednesday morning on I-495 in Bethesda.
Montgomery County Fire & Rescue Service spokesman Pete Piringer told a reporter that one person suffered minor injuries.
No word on what caused the truck to roll over, but the Washington Post reports traffic was backed up for miles when two lanes of the highway were closed around 6am.
