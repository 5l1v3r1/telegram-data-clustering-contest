        <b>She says that details of her past stopped her being asked back for the new sequel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kristen Stewart has claimed that “slut-shaming” meant she wasn’t asked back to audition for a role in the new <i>Snow White</i> sequel.</p>
      <p>The actress, who appeared in 2012’s <i>Snow White and the Huntsman,</i> spoke to DJ Howard Stern on <i>Sirius XM</i> radio this week. On it, she addressed the aftermath of her public affair with <i>Snow White</i> director Rupert Sanders around the film’s release in 2012.</p>

      <p>“We lived in a different time then, you know what I mean?” she said. “I feel like the slut-shaming that went down was so absurd. And they should’ve put me in that movie! It would’ve been better. Not to be a dick, but…”</p>
      <p>Stewart continued: “They didn’t put me in that movie because I went through such a highly publicised scandal, and so they were like scared of touching that.”</p>

      <p>“That was a really hard period of my life,” she added. “I was really young, I didn’t really know how to deal with that. I made some mistakes. And honestly, it’s no one’s business.</p>
      <p>“Basically, what I’m saying is, the work to me genuinely was ignored in a really sort of frivolous, silly, petty way. For a group of adult people who were supposed to be running studios and making films? Honestly, the film industry in Hollywood is so fear-based.</p>
      <p>“I think they’re idiots, because if you take a little risk and make something good, people will watch it and like it and pay you.”</p>
      <p>The new revelation comes after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/kristen-stewart-was-told-to-tone-down-sexuality-if-she-wanted-to-bag-marvel-roles-2544407">Stewart recently revealed she was told to “tone down” sexuality if she wanted to bag Marvel roles</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Stewart <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/watch-first-charlies-angels-trailer-featuring-miley-ariana-lanas-collab-2517847">is set to star in the new reboot of <i>Charlie’s Angels</i></a>, which hits the big screen this month and sees her appear alongside Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska.</p>
