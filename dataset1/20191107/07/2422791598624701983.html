      <p>LAHORE, Pakistan -- Dangerously poor air quality has forced Pakistan's government to close all schools in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province and home to 11 million people.</p>
      <p>A thick smog is hanging over the city, caused in part by widespread crop burning in the surrounding province. It's a popular practice among poor farmers, who set fire to remnants of the previous season's crop to prepare the land for their next planting. Punjab is considered Pakistan's breadbasket.</p>
      <p>Heavy traffic, open fires for cooking and warmth as well as years of cutting down trees have all contributed to the city's poor air quality.</p>
      <p>Lahore's air quality index was 114 on Thursday morning, which is considered hazardous, particularly for sensitive groups like children.</p>
