According to the EAC, the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad discussed the results of an impact study on the CPTPP conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

In addition to the government's efforts to create a more competitive, efficient and conducive domestic market environment, the EAC also discussed the results of a review on the national food sector market under the Competition Act 2010.
