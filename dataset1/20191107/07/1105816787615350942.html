      <h1>Arsene Wenger in talks with Bayern</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:43:24+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BERLIN: </b>Arsene Wenger is reportedly in talks with Bayern Munich to potentially become their new head coach while Ralf Rangnick, another possible candidate, is said to not be interested.</p>
      <p>Wenger, 70, gave an evasive answer when broadcaster beIn Sports directly asked him about working at Bayern, who dismissed Niko Kovac on Sunday in the wake of a 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>

      <p>According to German daily Bild, talks have taken place between Wenger and Bayern with club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge leading the search to find Kovac’s replacement.</p>
      <p>Wenger, who speaks fluent German, coached Arsenal from October 1996 until May 2018 and said that he misses some aspects of coaching.</p>
      <p>While Wenger has enjoyed his year away from football, the satisfaction of winning matches and preparing players is “something you miss, of course,” said the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rangnick, currently head of sport and development at Red Bull and the previous sports director at Bundesliga side RB Leipzig, is reportedly the latest big name to turn Bayern down.</p>
      <p>“Ralf is not available. We don’t believe that what Ralf Rangnick is all about is currently being sought by Bayern,” Rangnick’s manager Marc Kosicke told Bild.</p>
      <p>“That why it doesn’t make sense to hold concrete talks.”</p>
      <p>Rangnick joins Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel by stating they will not leave their current jobs this season.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, club president Uli Hoeness said they expected to be able to name a new coach in time for Bayern’s trip to Fortuna Duesseldorf on November 23.</p>

      <p>Former Real Madrid and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and ex-Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri have also been linked to the job by the German media.</p>
      <p>Former Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick took over as interim coach for Wednesday’s 2-0 Champions League win at home to Olympiakos.</p>
      <p>He will also oversee Saturday’s Bundesliga match against second-placed Dortmund at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are currently fourth in the table.</p>
      <p>Before kick-off on Wednesday, director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic refused to confirm whether Wenger and Rangnick have been approached.</p>
      <p>“We don’t comment on rumours,” said Salihamidzic.</p>
      <p>However, he revealed Flick could stay on longer as caretaker coach should their preferred candidate only be available next season.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see. I am glad Hansi Flick is here. At the moment he is the right coach.”</p>
