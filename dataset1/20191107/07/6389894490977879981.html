      <h1>DEBATE: Will the M&amp;S venture with Ocado turn around its fortunes?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:13:06+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Vettese</a></address>
      <p>Will Marks &amp; Spencer’s joint venture with Ocado turn around the struggling retailer’s fortunes?</p>
      <h3>YES, says Adam Vettese, investment analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro</h3>
      <p>When you think of <a href="https://www.cityam.com/ms-finance-boss-heads-for-the-exit/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, you think of food. And not just any food, but top-quality food.</p>
      <p>In fact, food is so important to M&amp;S that it now accounts for 58 per cent of group revenue – nearly double the amount that its clothing and home division makes.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the UK’s online grocery market is forecast to grow 60 per cent to nearly £20bn by 2023. </p>
      <p>Therefore, M&amp;S’s foray into the world of online groceries is of vital importance if it is to cement and grow its place in the market.</p>
      <p>The joint venture with <a href="https://www.cityam.com/asos-to-appoint-ocado-boss-to-board-as-it-plots-leadership-shake-up/">Ocado</a> – which has the best technology in the business – not only does just that, it will also allow M&amp;S to cut costs and bolster its finances in the long run.  </p>
      <p>Of course, both companies will have to win over the sceptics, but if they get things right there is every possibility that M&amp;S’s new online shopping presence can offset the poor performance of its failing clothing and home division.</p>
      <h3>NO, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com</h3>
      <p>M&amp;S increasingly looks like <a href="https://www.cityam.com/marks-spencers-profit-falls-on-poor-clothing-sales/">a grocer that also does clothing</a>, with 60 per cent of revenues now coming from food. So, the Ocado tie-up is central to the turnaround strategy. </p>
      <p>But at about £800m it’s an expensive entry into a sector – online groceries – that doesn’t make any money for the major supermarkets. Goldman Sachs reckons that it will only deliver £10m a year in free cash flow by 2024.</p>
      <p>M&amp;S basket sizes are tiny at about £14, versus the £108 at Ocado, making online uneconomic. The joint venture will of course see this figure rise, but M&amp;S seems to be banking on consumers changing their habits, by making M&amp;S the place for their big weekly shop rather than for the occasional top-up or getting a prawn sandwich on the go. This seems hard to imagine in value-conscious Britain where discounters are on the march. </p>
      <p>And as Waitrose goods are switched out for M&amp;S products, customer loyalty on the Ocado platform will be tested, particularly as the John Lewis grocer expands its £1bn online operation.</p>
