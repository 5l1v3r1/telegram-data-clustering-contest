「得不到也不便宜別人」　渣男散布前女友性愛照還哭窮
07 Nov 2019, 07:46 by 林慶祥, 攝影組
台中市一名楊姓男子，不甘前女友要嫁人，竟將兩人交往期間經對方同意拍攝的性愛影片、裸露私密照，PO在個大色情網站，甚至附上女友真實姓名。前女友憤而提告，庭訊時楊男哭窮，聲稱經營麵攤不善，已經倒閉，他最多只能賠償10萬，但法官認為，影片內容極其私密，文字更是私生活露骨不雅的負面描述，楊男賠償50萬為適當。
台中地院判決書指出，楊姓男子與前女友交往期間，他在女友同意之下，拍攝性愛影片供兩人觀賞，但分手之後，楊男並未刪除，還是保留在硬碟裡。去年底，楊男知道前女友及將要嫁給別人，心起怨念，他認為自己得不到的，寧可咬爛也不能便宜別人。
楊男將兩人性愛照片、前女友私密裸照，PO在各大色情網站，他還公布前女友真實姓名，並剪輯其生活照及文字介紹，內容露骨，且極盡貶抑之能事，對女友更有許多污辱性的負面描述。

前女友經友人告知，氣憤不已，她認為隱私權及名譽權受損，向台中地院提告，求償200萬元；庭訊時，楊男坦承犯案，但他向法官哭窮，聲稱他的麵攤還賠錢、收入不佳，現已停業，還需扶養幼子，最多只能賠10萬元。
法官認為，楊男擁有兩人交往時合意拍攝性愛影片，非竊錄或脅迫手段取得，雖然沒有妨害秘密，但他將性愛影片散布於色情網站，網路散佈速度快且廣，遭第三人下載、重製，或再轉行散布機率極高，已難予完全回收、刪除，對原告損害難以量化。
被害人請求隱私權及人格權損害賠償有理，被害人狀態仍持續存在，致她精神上受極大的痛苦，楊男辯稱事發後已刪除影片，但卻無法證明是否被轉載的也能收回，審酌影片內容極其私密，一般女性都不願被親密愛人以外之人所見，而附加之文字更是被害人私生活露骨不雅的負面描述，足以貶損被害人人格及名譽，應該賠償50萬元為適當。

""I can't get it, it's not cheap,"" Scum man spreads his ex-girlfriend's sex and still crying poorly.
07 Nov 2019, 07:46 by Lin Qingxiang, Photography Group
A male surnamed Yang in Taichung City, not willing to marry his ex-girlfriend, actually took the sex film and naked private photos that were agreed by the other party during the exchange, PO was on a big porn site, and even attached his girlfriend's real name. The former girlfriend angered and complained that Yang Man was crying poorly at the hearing, claiming that the business was not well-off and had closed down. He could only compensate 100,000 at most, but the judge believed that the content of the film was extremely private and the text was a negative description of private life. Yang male compensated 500,000 as appropriate.
The judgment of the Taichung District Court pointed out that during the relationship between the male surname Yang and his ex-girlfriend, he photographed a sex movie for the two to watch, with the consent of his girlfriend, but after the breakup, Yang Nan did not delete it, or kept it on the hard disk. At the end of last year, Yang Nan knew that his ex-girlfriend and his wife would marry others, and he felt resentful. He thought that he could not get it, and he would rather not be cheaper than others.
Yang Nan will take photos of two sexes and ex-girlfriends in private nudes. PO is on the major porn sites. He also announced the real names of his ex-girlfriends, and edited his life photos and texts. The content is explicit and extremely derogatory. There are many negative descriptions of insults.

The ex-girlfriend told her friends that she was angry. She believed that the right to privacy and reputation was damaged. She appealed to Taichung’s court and demanded 2 million yuan. At the hearing, Yang Nan confessed to committing the crime, but he cried to the judge and claimed his face. Amortization lost money, poor income, has been closed, but also need to support young children, up to only 100,000 yuan.
The judge believes that Yang Nan has the right to film sex films when they are in contact with each other. It is not pirated or coercive. Although there is no harm to the secret, he spreads the sex videos on pornographic websites, and the Internet spreads quickly and widely. Downloading, re-creating, or re-transfer is extremely high, and it is difficult to completely recycle and delete it. It is difficult to quantify the damage to the plaintiff.
The victim’s request for privacy and personal rights damages was justified, and the victim’s status continued to exist, causing her to suffer great mental pain. Yang Nan argued that the film had been deleted after the incident, but it could not prove whether it could be reclaimed. Discretionary film content is extremely private. Generally, women are not willing to be seen by people other than intimate lover. The additional text is a negative description of the victim's private life. It is enough to detract from the victim's personality and reputation. It should be appropriate to compensate 500,000 yuan.
