        <i>BMW in Australia begins voluntary recall of E46 3 Series cars produced between November 1997 and June 2000</i>
      </p>
      <p>Some 12,000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bmw">BMW</a> vehicles are being urgently recalled after transport safety authorities identified another Takata airbag that poses a critical risk of death or serious injury, the competition watchdog says.</p>
      <p>BMW in Australia on Thursday began a voluntary recall of its E46 3 Series cars produced between November 1997 and June 2000.</p>
      <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says it comes after safety authorities identified a pattern of abnormal airbag deployments involving BMW cars in Australia, Japan and the United States.</p>
      <p>If a vehicle with an affected airbag crashes, the airbag inflator could rupture, causing sharp metal fragments to enter the vehicle cabin at high speed, the ACCC says.</p>
      <p>Owners of the vehicles are advised to stop driving them immediately and contact their local BMW dealership or BMW Australia’s Takata hotline on 1800 243 675 for a free inspection.</p>
      <p>“BMW will arrange to tow your vehicle to repair facilities for inspection, or send a mobile technician out to your premises or vehicle’s location to inspect the vehicle,” the ACCC’s deputy chair, Delia Rickard, said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“If your vehicle has been fitted with one of these dangerous airbags, BMW will arrange a loan or hire car or reimbursement for alternative transportation costs until airbag replacement parts are available or until other arrangements are made.</p>
      <p>“You may also wish to discuss the vehicle being purchased back by BMW.”</p>
      <p>The airbags are Takata NADI-type 5AT airbags and are not part of the current Takata airbag compulsory recall.</p>
