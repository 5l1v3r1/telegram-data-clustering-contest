彭定康：香港整整一代人 被中共逼向對立

07 Nov 2019, 07:06

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】香港反送中抗爭運動已進入第5個月，末代港督彭定康（Chris Patten）11月6日接受澳洲廣播公司（ABC）專訪時表示，中共已經放棄《中英聯合聲明》的內容及精神，自香港移交22年以來，其所作所為令一代的香港人希望獨立。
根據《ABC》報導，彭定康受訪時指出，從任何角度來看，北京已經放棄《中英聯合聲明》的內容及精神，自1997年香港回歸以來，中共22年間的所作所為，實際造就一代想要獨立的香港人。對於中方一再重申香港事務是中共內政，與《中英聯合聲明》無關，彭定康表示，他不認同這種說法，香港問題恰巧體現中共在國際事務上的雙重標準，「中共有個習慣是，國際協議是別人需要遵守的，不是中共需要遵守的」。
對於中共政府及官媒多次斥責彭定康是干預香港的「黑手」，彭定康大呼荒謬，並表示多數香港示威者都是在1997年後出生，不是英國殖民時期的公民。彭定康痛斥中共「純粹是政治宣傳的說詞」。
此前，法廣6月6日曾報導，香港當局正試圖讓當地議會投票通過《逃犯條例》的修訂，以便允許將嫌犯引渡到至今和香港還沒有達成引渡協議的國家，其中包括中國大陸。對於香港最後一任總督彭定康來說，這項法案的通過將是香港可能發生的最糟糕的事情。
彭定康說：「這一建議或這一系列的建議嚴重破壞香港的法治、穩定和安全，打擊香港作為國際貿易平台的地位。這是我的看法，這也是大部分香港人和國際社會的看法？為什麼這麼重要呢？因為這是近年來發生的一系列事件的一部分。北京正在努力或至少正在試圖加強對香港的控制，我認為最新的引渡法案是該戰略的一部分。」
彭定康還說：「雖然半自治的香港當局表示，這項法律應該會填補法律上存在的一個真空，允許將一個謀殺他伴侶的香港人引渡到台灣，但批評人士確信這一謀殺案事實上只是一個藉口，一個讓北京高興的藉口，批評人士擔心這部法律會使人民受到一個不透明的和政治化的中共司法制度的擺佈。」

Patten: Hong Kong’s entire generation was forced by the CCP

07 Nov 2019, 07:06

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign has entered its fifth month. Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on November 6 that the CCP The content and spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration have been abandoned. Since the handover of Hong Kong for 22 years, the Hong Kong people who have made a generation have wanted independence.
According to ABC, when PATTEN was interviewed, he pointed out that from any point of view, Beijing has given up the content and spirit of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Since the return of Hong Kong in 1997, the CCP’s 22 years of work have actually created a generation. I want an independent Hong Kong person. The Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that Hong Kong affairs are the internal affairs of the Chinese Communist Party. It has nothing to do with the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Patten said that he does not agree with this statement. The Hong Kong issue happens to reflect the CCP's double standards in international affairs. ""The common habit is that International agreements are something that others need to abide, not what the CCP needs to observe.""
The Chinese government and the official media have repeatedly criticized Patten for being a ""black hand"" to intervene in Hong Kong. Patten is ridiculous and said that most Hong Kong demonstrators were born after 1997, not British colonial citizens. Patten swears that the CCP is ""a purely political propaganda.""
Earlier, France and Guangdong reported on June 6 that the Hong Kong authorities were trying to get the local council to vote on the revision of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance to allow the extradition of suspects to countries that have not yet reached an extradition agreement with Hong Kong, including mainland China. For the last Governor of Hong Kong, Patten, the passage of this bill will be the worst thing that can happen in Hong Kong.
Patten said: ""This proposal or this series of proposals seriously undermines the rule of law, stability and security in Hong Kong and combats Hong Kong's status as an international trading platform. This is my opinion. This is also the view of most Hong Kong people and the international community. Why is it so important? Because this is part of a series of events that have occurred in recent years. Beijing is working hard or at least trying to strengthen its control over Hong Kong. I think the latest extradition bill is part of this strategy.""
Patten also said: ""Although the semi-autonomous Hong Kong authorities said that the law should fill a vacuum in law, allowing a Hong Kong person who murdered his partner to be extradited to Taiwan, critics are convinced that the murder is in fact It’s just an excuse, an excuse for Beijing to be happy, and critics worry that this law will expose people to an opaque and politicized CCP judicial system.""
