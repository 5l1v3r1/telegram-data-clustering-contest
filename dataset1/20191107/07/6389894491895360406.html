      <p>Sainsbury’s has reported a double-digit drop in half-year profit, underlining the a turbulent period for one of Britain’s largest grocers.</p>
      <p>Underlying profit before tax hit £238m in the 28 weeks to 21 September 2019, slumping 15 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Statutory pre-tax profit fell from £107m to £9m, following a one-off write-down from a review of its property portfolio.</p>
      <p> The firm cited the “combined impact of the phasing of cost savings, higher marketing costs and tough weather comparatives”.</p>
      <p>Group sales edged down 0.2 per cent to £16.86bn, while like-for-like sales fell one per cent.</p>
      <p>Retail sales (excluding fuel) were down 0.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said: “We are investing in hundreds of Sainsbury’s and Argos stores, introducing new products and services and continually improving service and availability. As a result, customer satisfaction has increased significantly year on year.</p>
      <p>“We have set out our plan to create one multi brand, multi-channel business. This will make the combined Sainsbury’s and Argos offer much more accessible for customers and gives us the opportunity to make our business more efficient.”</p>
