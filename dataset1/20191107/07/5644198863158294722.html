      <p>BANGKOK: An American drug suspect and his Thai wife who went on the run after they <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/drug-suspects-shoot-way-out-of-thai-court-12065748">shot and stabbed their way out</a> of a courtroom were apprehended Wednesday (Nov 6), authorities said, with the man shooting his wife and then himself as police closed in.</p>
      <p>The couple, along with an associate, had made their brazen and violent escape from a court holding room in the seedy southern city of Pattaya on Monday, wounding a police officer before fleeing in a pick-up truck.</p>

      <p>But on Wednesday they were tracked down in Sa Kaeo province, which shares a border with Cambodia, with the American taking his wife hostage in the ensuing standoff with police.</p>
      <p>"The foreign suspect shot his wife, and then himself," Sattawat Hiranburana, assistant to the national police chief, told AFP, adding that the American had sustained "serious" injuries.</p>
      <p>The wife was also wounded though in a less critical condition, Sattawat said.</p>
      <p>The couple are facing death penalty charges for drug trafficking, although sentences are rarely carried out.</p>
      <p>The third suspect was apprehended separately, police said, while two others suspected of helping the trio make their daring getaway were also detained.</p>
      <p>According to local TV, the authorities had acted on a tip-off from a villager in Sa Kaeo, who saw the couple acting suspiciously.</p>
      <p>Thailand is both a producer and major transit hub for drugs.</p>
      <p>Much regional drug manufacturing takes place in the Golden Triangle, a remote border region where Myanmar, Laos and Thailand all meet.</p>
