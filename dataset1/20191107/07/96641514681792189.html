Another tech giant, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/05/yandex-nhl-streams-free-russia/">Yandex</a>, is working on its own autonomous package carrier, called Yandex.Rover.</p>

      <p>Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/28/yandex-public-tests-self-driving-cars-russia/">self-driving division</a> is trialing Yandex.Rovers (which are based on the same tech as the cars) at the company's Moscow headquarters. For now, they're carrying documents to a shuttle that connects Yandex offices throughout the city. The robot can plan its route, detect and bypass obstacles and give pedestrians and pets the right of way.</p>
      <p>Yandex.Rover, which is about the size of a suitcase, rolls along at walking pace and can even operate in the dark because it uses LiDAR to navigate. Given Moscow's climate, it'll be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/28/yandex-tests-self-driving-cars-in-winter/">put to the test in a variety of weather conditions.</a></p>
      <p>While the robot travels autonomously, it'll remain under remote supervision during testing. The company hopes to use Yandex.Rover for restaurant, grocery and meal-kit deliveries, as well as for its online store Beru and in its warehouse. It might sell robots to other companies, too.</p>
