美國學者開酸　習近平是蔡英文拚連任的「榮譽競選主席」
07 Nov 2019, 07:19 by 謝文哲, 鄒保祥
2020總統大選將至，中國一連串施壓，反讓總統蔡英文原本落後的民調起死回生，賓州大學當代中國研究中心主任戴杰（Jacque deLisle）幽默稱中國最高領導人習近平對一國兩制的談話和對香港反送中的強硬表態，堪稱是蔡英文總統競選連任的「榮譽競選陣營主席」。
《美國之音》今（7日）刊出報導〈北京是民進黨最佳助選員？〉，內容提到中國自年初以來對台一連串施壓，反讓蔡英文總統的民調起死回生，許多人對中國的做法不解，認為中國未從過去經驗得到教訓。
戴杰在華盛頓的兩岸會議中提到，中國強硬打壓讓台灣獲得更多美國和國際支持，反過來對北京自身造成反效果，他笑稱習近平應該被總統蔡英文任命為「榮譽競選陣營主席」（honorary campaign chairman），直言習近平年初的一國兩制談話和香港反送中問題，「是他或任何人能夠為蔡英文做的最好事情。」
前美國在台協會主席卜睿哲（Richard Bush）則提到，過去他認為中國打壓台灣是想懲罰民進黨、懲罰把選票投給蔡英文的台灣選民，因此挖走台灣的邦交國只是懲罰的手段之一。但如今卜睿哲卻有不同看法，反映出其實中國不在乎台灣是由誰執政，「或許它只對展示和行使它的權力有興趣而已。」
而前美國在台協會台北辦事處處長包道格（Douglas Paal）也有類似觀點，他認為中國甚至已經準備好，看民進黨贏得第二任、甚至未來第三個總統任期也由民進黨人擔任，為了避免對台政策受到台灣政黨輪替影響，中國對台選舉採取更務實手段－－「繞過執政者和政府部門，把『胡蘿蔔』直接給予台灣企業和一般民眾」，而這週才發布的26條惠台措施便是其中的一環。

American scholars open up acidity Xi Jinping is the ""honor campaign president"" of Tsai Ing-wen
07 Nov 2019, 07:19 by Xie Wenzhe, Zou Baoxiang
The 2020 presidential election is approaching, China has a series of pressures, and the president’s backward English polls have been brought back to life. Jacque deLisle, director of the Center for Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, humorously called the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on the one country, two systems. The tough stance in Hong Kong's counter-delivery is the ""honor of the election campaign camp"" for the re-election of President Tsai Ing-wen.
""Voice of America"" today (7th) published a report ""Beijing is the best candidate for the DPP? 〉, the content mentioned that China has exerted a series of pressure on Taiwan since the beginning of the year, which has caused President Tsai Ing-wen’s poll to come back to life. Many people are puzzled by China’s approach and believe that China has not learned from past experience.
In his cross-strait meeting in Washington, Dai Jie mentioned that China’s tough pressure has given Taiwan more American and international support, which in turn has had a counter-effect on Beijing itself. He laughed that Xi Jinping should be appointed by President Tsai Ing-wen as the “Honest Campaign Camp Chairman” ( Honorary campaign chairman), bluntly speaking, the issue of ""one country, two systems"" and the reversal of Hong Kong at the beginning of Xi Jinping, ""is the best thing he or anyone can do for Tsai Ing-wen.""
Former US President of the Taiwan Association, Richard Bush, mentioned that in the past he believed that China’s suppression of Taiwan was to punish the DPP and punish Taiwan voters who voted for Tsai Ing-wen. Therefore, it is only a punishment for Taiwan’s diplomatic relations. one. But now Bu Ruizhe has different views, reflecting that China does not care who Taiwan is in power. ""Perhaps it is only interested in the power to display and exercise it.""
Douglas Paal, former director of the Taipei Office of the Taiwan Association of Taiwan, has similar views. He believes that China is even ready to see that the DPP won the second term, and even the third presidential term in the future is also In order to prevent the Taiwan policy from being affected by the rotation of Taiwan’s political parties, China’s election to Taiwan has taken a more pragmatic approach – “bypassing the governors and government departments and giving “carrots” directly to Taiwanese enterprises and the general public”. The 26 Huitai measures released by Zhou Cai are part of this.
