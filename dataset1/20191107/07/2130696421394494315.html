      <p>FIRST-TIME Malaysian home owners will power consumer spending with their purchase of home furnishings and other household goods in the next five years.</p>
      <p>Spending on household goods is expected to hit 55.6 billion ringgit (S$18.1 billion) by 2023, according to Fitch Solutions research, for a compound annual growth of 7.6 per cent from 2019.</p>
      <p>Furniture, home appliances and utensils make up the bulk of household spending, with the glass, tableware and utensils segment projected to grow the fastest among household goods.</p>
      <p>Fitch analysts noted that home-grown Mr DIY and multinationals such as Ikea and Harvey Norman will likely benefit - including in the East Malaysian regions of Sarawak and Sabah, where ongoing mega-infrastructure projects should create jobs and drive demand.</p>
      <p>Fitch’s analysis came alongside an assessment by AmInvestment Bank that “the key problem in the current soft property market is the supply-demand mismatch, with many potential buyers having difficulties in obtaining loans due to their already high debt service ratios”.</p>

      <p>Still, the Fitch analysts wrote: “The key driver of this strong growth in spending on household goods stems from the country’s real estate growth outlook, especially the projected demand among first-time buyers, who will be furnishing their new properties for the first time.”</p>
      <p>They pointed to a property market recovery, as well as public initiatives such as the national Home Ownership Campaign for affordable housing.</p>
