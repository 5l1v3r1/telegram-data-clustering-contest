      <p>WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand has placed itself on the right side of history in the battle against climate change, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday, after lawmakers adopted a measure to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s framework enshrines in law the new 2050 greenhouse gas reduction target and makes it a legally binding objective to keep global warming below a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius forecast by the United Nations.</p>
      <p>“Today, we have made a choice that I am proud of,” Ardern told parliament. “I hope it means the next generation will see that we...were on the right side of history.”</p>
      <p>The bill, spearheaded by her center-left Labour-led coalition government, was passed with cross party support from the main opposition National Party, despite changes promised by the latter if it wins the next election in 2020.</p>
      <p>The bill accords different treatment to methane emissions from animals versus other greenhouse gases, but still targets a cut of 10% in biological methane by 2030, and up to 47% by 2050.</p>
      <p>“This...is the centerpiece for meaningful climate change action in New Zealand,” said Minister for Climate Change James Shaw, the leader of the Green party, which is in coalition with Ardern’s Labour.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers had received 11,000 submissions and heard from a cross-section of society, from students and scientists to farmers and activists, Shaw added.</p>
