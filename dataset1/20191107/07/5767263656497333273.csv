20 Tough Cats That Won’t Let You Get Away That Easily

07 Nov 2019, 07:30

Even dog people sometimes go “aww” when looking at a tiny clumsy kitten. Not to mention cat owners who usually go crazy about their pets. Sometimes the level of madness is so high that they don’t even notice the obvious, strange things in the behavior of their pets: all those unnatural poses, the way they stare at you, and the eyes that have a fire burning in them.
We at Bright Side came across some evidence that cats are not always nice and fluffy. It seems some of them are trying to hide their dark side in vain.

“I heard that if a cat sees a circle, he will definitely sit inside of it. But here something went hilariously wrong.”

My human is behaving badly again!

Your face looks like this when you are making plans to conquer the world.



“Watching my mom’s animals while she is away... was not warned about this one.”

If you suddenly see this, you might want to run away and leave all your property to this cat.

“So my girlfriend saw this at the front door at 3:00 AM. We don’t have a cat.”

Do your cats behave in a strange way too? We would be glad to hear from you in the comments!
