高智商不一定帶來成功，「適當練習」才是背後的關鍵（下）
07 Nov 2019, 07:03 by 樹洞 - TreeholeHK


我們想讓你知道的是心理學家Anders Ericsson認為記憶力減弱是長期沒有使用大腦記憶功能所致，因此用些少時間重新「reboot」，持續練習就能恢復當年，因此人到中年，依然係有能力繼續學習。

「神以前都係人，自從佢做到人做唔到嘅嘢，佢就成為咗神。」《頭文字D》阿木
借《頭文字D》一句電影對白，如果今日你開個價，去買一個由人變神嘅秘訣，你會出幾多錢？我計過，其實唔算貴，你都俾得起，分分鐘乞兒都畀得起，特別喺21世紀呢個時代，爭在你肯唔肯比。
將一個平凡人推上神台的故事
《刻意練習》（Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise）的作者Anders Ericsson覺得大腦其實同肌肉一樣，只要搵到適當的方法訓練，大腦就可以做到很多出色的事情。
在書的開始，Ericsson紀錄了一個為期兩年的實驗，每星期到實驗室進行數次長達一小時的記憶練習。實驗目的很簡單，試著找出實驗者在短時間內能記得多少個數字，然後通過持續練習，找出普通人可否突破瓶頸做到超乎常人的事情。
實驗的內容是每一秒會讀出一個數字，實驗者需要嘗試記住組成的數字串。對於香港人而言，記得八個數字應該不算是難事，而Ericsson的實驗對象在頭幾次的實驗也只是徘徊在10個數字附近。但經過四個月的練習，成績躍升到一次能記得15個數字。最終兩年後完成實驗當天，記得到82個數字。背後的故事並不神秘，只是很難很難，但卻合乎想像。
練習有三個要訣：專注（Focus）、反饋（Feedback）、糾正（rectification）
專注（Focus）：有清晰及有目的訓練目標。漫無目的地練習只會使你身心沮喪，苦苦不見成果下放棄繼續訓練。
反饋（Feedback）：即是犯錯的時候，有導師會指出錯誤及提供正確的方法。反饋不一定由導師／教練指出，也可以由自己給予自己反饋。例如電競選手要得到反饋則很簡單，只要重播當場的賽事，不斷回看自己犯錯的畫面便算是一樣反饋。
糾正（Rectification）︰當掌握自己的錯誤，便開始制定和思量新的方法去解決問題。
你會質疑：如此類推，不斷重覆，便可練成神功？
實驗者也是個普通的心理學系學生，但結果顯示即使同一套訓練方法，用於不同受試者身上真的會出現不同結果。有一位實驗者在達到30個數字的時候，遇上了瓶頸，但久久沒能找到方法突破，然後就選擇了放棄。作者指出記得82個數字創舉的實驗者也常遇到瓶頸未能夠突破，但他的選擇是傾向思考不同方法嘗試，尋求新的突破口。
Ericsson在書中直言，達成創舉其實與他的背景有很大關係，也表示自己實驗成功有一定程度的運氣，因為實驗者者其實是個長跑的愛好者，面對瓶頸時，有一定的韌力和耐性支持，所以實驗最終由預期的幾個星期延續至兩年，並達成了當時前所未有的創舉。
讓自己退回心理舒適區（Comfort Zone）
Ericsson的實驗設定非常有趣，若某次的練習失敗，則會向後倒退兩個數字，讓實驗者再嘗試。如此的設定對實驗者的心理其實有很大的幫助，我們在制定訓練計劃的時候都可以嘗試使用。
因為人對於從未做過的事情，腦袋會感到很不舒服，有著很多抵抗，例如大腦釋出一些信號：「我覺得自己做不到」、「我從未試過跑這麼遠」、「這個很難，我辦不到的」。
因此將練習目標退後兩個數字，目的是讓實驗者退回自己的舒適區內，建立起信心後，再向前邁進，擴大自己的舒適區，在不斷衝擊新的目標時，不會累積太多挫敗感的訓練設定。
除此之外，胡師傅的「畀啲掙扎」確有其精秒之處，因為太大的掙扎，大腦只會感覺到極度痛苦，換來的結果只有積極逃避。例如，初初健身的朋友，若缺乏導師指導，一落場心頭太高，不斷舉這個，練那個，目標要一個月內練出人魚線云云。一來身體很容易受傷，二來太大幅跨越大腦的舒適區，就會使到過程極度痛苦。「循序漸進」和「畀啲掙扎」能使身體緩緩適應，接受現狀，建立起更大面積的舒適區。

P.S. 因發夢而耽誤寫作，拖稿甚久，特設以下番外篇：
番外篇：無師自通，神級英文點樣練
《刻意練習》中有個故事：富蘭克林在年輕的時候，很羨慕其他人能夠寫出優秀嘅文章，而自己卻缺乏導師指導寫作。所以他乾脆將當時的雜誌《The Spectator》當作教材，展開了「自己寫文自己教」的旅程。
一開始的時候先「觀察」，他勾選了幾篇自己喜歡的文章，加上簡單的注釋，好讓自己能夠回想起大意。如果自己忘記了文章某些句子的措辭後，就嘗試用自己的文筆，以最相近的方式重寫句子。然後就是反饋和糾正，他會將自己重寫的句子，再對比《The Spectator》的原文，思考自己與其他作家在表達同一事件時的用詞、表達和描寫方式。這種不斷找出錯誤，然後改正的過程，使到富蘭克林的寫作功力進步神速。
Ericsson指富蘭克林後來創造了出一個練習變體，幫自己更有效率地練習，但不在此詳述，歡迎參照《刻意練習》第六章：沒有導師怎麼辦。
番番外篇：小作實驗篇
《刻意練習》將刻意練習的概念寫得非常清晰，當然要嘗試應用在生活上。筆者就喺大學Exchange的時候有幸拜閱，就嘗試制定一個跑步計畫，整個model的設計目標就是跑兩日，休息一日，每次跑步都向前推進1分鐘或者30秒。如果太累或者不在狀態，當天便慢跑並傾向記錄不變。成績由一開始只能夠跑9分鐘到最後可以堅持40分鐘。（然後就沒有然後了，因為回到香港，便是另一個故事了，哈哈。）
番番番外篇：逆轉的可能性
點解我開頭會話人人都比得起，因為個價真係好易開，可以係十年，係二十年，甚至三十年，而時間人人都有，在乎嘅係你會否願意持續地做「呢件事」，不斷地練習、出錯、再加以糾正。有很多中年人，包括自己父母都時常用腦袋退化，記憶不如以往作藉口，拒絕學習新知識。
但事實並非如此，即使人到中年，Ericsson描述腦袋依然具有一定的「可塑性」，記唔入腦只是長期沒有使用大腦記憶功能所致，因此用些少時間重新「reboot」，持續練習就能恢復當年，因此人到中年，依然係有能力繼續學習。

High IQ does not necessarily lead to success. ""Appropriate practice"" is the key behind it (below)
07 Nov 2019, 07:03 by Tree Cave - TreeholeHK


What we want you to know is that psychologist Anders Ericsson believes that memory loss is caused by not using brain memory for a long time, so use less time to re-reboot, and continue to practice to restore the year, so people still have middle-aged Ability to continue learning.

""God used to be a man. Since he has done it, he has become a god."" ""Initial D"" Amu
Borrow a movie dialogue with ""Initial D"". If you open a price today and buy a secret that is changed from person to person, how much money will you pay? I have counted, in fact, it is expensive, you can afford it, you can afford it in minutes, especially in the 21st century, and you will be willing to be willing.
The story of pushing an ordinary person to the platform
Anders Ericsson, author of ""Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise,"" thinks that the brain is actually the same as the muscles, and the brain can do a lot of good things as long as the appropriate method is trained.
At the beginning of the book, Ericsson recorded a two-year experiment that went to the lab several times a week for a memory exercise. The purpose of the experiment is very simple. Try to find out how many numbers the experimenter can remember in a short time, and then continue to practice to find out whether ordinary people can break through the bottleneck and do things beyond ordinary people.
The content of the experiment is that a number is read every second, and the experimenter needs to try to remember the composed number string. For Hong Kong people, remembering eight numbers shouldn't be difficult, and Ericsson's subjects in the first few experiments were only around 10 numbers. But after four months of practice, the score jumped to one time to remember 15 numbers. On the day of the completion of the experiment two years later, I recorded 82 figures. The story behind it is not mysterious, it is hard to be difficult, but it is imaginative.
There are three key points in practice: Focus, Feedback, and rectification.
Focus: There are clear and purposeful training goals. A goalless practice will only make you physically and mentally depressed, and will give up training if you don't see the results.
Feedback: When a mistake is made, a tutor will point out the error and provide the correct method. Feedback is not necessarily pointed out by the instructor/coach, and feedback can be given by myself. For example, e-sports players need to get feedback is very simple, as long as the replay of the event on the spot, and constantly look back at the picture of their mistakes is the same feedback.
Rectification: When you master your own mistakes, you begin to develop and think about new ways to solve problems.
You will question: So analogous, repeated, you can practice magic?
The experimenter was also an ordinary psychology student, but the results showed that even the same set of training methods would really have different results for different subjects. One experimenter encountered a bottleneck when he reached 30 figures, but he couldn't find a method breakthrough for a long time, and then chose to give up. The author points out that the experimenters who remembered the 82 digital innovations often encountered bottlenecks that could not be broken, but his choice was to try to think different ways and try to find new breakthroughs.
Ericsson bluntly said in the book that the achievement of the initiative has a lot to do with his background. He also said that he had a certain degree of luck in his experiment, because the experimenter is actually a long-distance lover, and he has certain resilience when facing the bottleneck. With patience support, the experiment lasted from the expected weeks to two years and reached an unprecedented initiative at the time.
Return yourself to the Comfort Zone
Ericsson's experimental setup is very interesting. If a practice fails, it will back backwards by two numbers and let the experimenter try again. Such a setting is actually very helpful to the psychology of the experimenter, and we can try it when we develop the training plan.
Because people can feel very uncomfortable about things they have never done before, there are many resistances, such as the brain releasing some signals: ""I don't think I can do it"", ""I have never tried to run so far"", ""This It's hard, I can't do it.""
Therefore, the practice goal is to retreat two figures, the purpose is to let the experimenter return to their comfort zone, build confidence, then move forward, expand their comfort zone, and not accumulate too much when constantly impacting new goals. More frustrating training settings.
In addition, Master Hu’s “struggling” does have its own fine seconds. Because of too much struggle, the brain only feels extreme pain, and the result is only actively evaded. For example, if a friend who was initially in fitness lacks the guidance of a mentor, the mind is too high, and he constantly raises this and practices it. The goal is to train the mermaid line in a month. Once the body is easily injured, and the second is too large across the comfort zone of the brain, it will make the process extremely painful. ""Step by step"" and ""striking struggle"" enable the body to adapt slowly, accept the status quo, and build a larger area of comfort.

P.S. Delayed writing due to dreams, and dragged the manuscript for a long time.
Fan outside articles: no teacher self-pass, God level English spotting practice
There is a story in Deliberate Practice: When Franklin was young, he envied that other people could write excellent articles, but he lacked a mentor to guide writing. So he simply used the magazine ""The Spectator"" as a textbook and started the journey of ""writing your own teaching.""
At the beginning, I first ""observed"". He ticked a few articles he liked, plus simple comments so that he could recall the general idea. If you have forgotten the wording of some sentences in your article, try to rewrite the sentence in the most similar way with your own pen. Then there is feedback and correction. He will rewrite the sentence he rewrote, compare the original text of The Spectator, and think about the way words, expressions and descriptions he and other writers use to express the same event. This process of constantly finding faults and then correcting makes Franklin's writing skills progress.
Ericsson pointed out that Franklin later created a practice variant to help himself practice more efficiently, but it is not detailed here. Welcome to Chapter 6 of Deliberate Practice: What to do without a mentor.
Fan Fan outside article: Xiao Zuo experiment
""Deliberate Practice"" writes the concept of deliberate practice very clearly, of course, try to apply it in life. When I was lucky enough to read at the University Exchange, I tried to develop a running plan. The design goal of the whole model was to run for two days, rest one day, and advance every time for 1 minute or 30 seconds. If you are too tired or not in the state, you will jog on the same day and tend to keep the record unchanged. The results can only be run for 9 minutes from the beginning to 40 minutes at the end. (Then there is no more, because when I return to Hong Kong, it is another story, haha.)
Fan Fanfan's external article: the possibility of reversal
I can meet everyone at the beginning of the conversation, because the price is really easy to open, can be ten years, twenty years, or even thirty years, and everyone has time, regardless of whether you would like to Continue to do ""things"", constantly practice, make mistakes, and then correct. There are many middle-aged people, including their own parents, who often use their heads to degenerate. Memory is not as excuses as before, and they refuse to learn new knowledge.
But this is not the case. Even if people are middle-aged, Ericsson describes that his head still has a certain ""plasticity"". It is only because he has not used the brain memory function for a long time. Therefore, he will use less time to re-reboot and continue to practice. In those days, people were still able to continue their studies in middle age.
