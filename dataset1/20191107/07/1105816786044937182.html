      <p><b>HYDERABAD: </b>An accident between a coach and a rickshaw on the National Highway in Sindh’s Matiari district claimed at least nine lives and injured three others, according to police and the local volunteers.</p>
      <p>A rickshaw transporting local labourers to their workplace was struck by a coach carrying passengers from Punjab’s Layyah to Karachi. Local police confirmed that all the deceased and injured were labourers.</p>
      <p>The deceased and injured were shifted to Taluka Hospital Saeedabad. Two of the injured are reportedly in a critical condition and they were referred to Hyderabad while another injured individual was sent to Nawabshah.</p>
      <p>Following the collision, police impounded the coach, which was transporting passengers to Karachi.</p>
      <p>However, the incident’s FIR has not been lodged so far.</p>
      <p>The accident again displays lax regulation by the National Highway and Motorway Police as a rickshaw overloaded with passengers was allowed to travel on the highway.</p>
