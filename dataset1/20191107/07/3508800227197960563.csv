由星島賣盤，想起媒體的紅色滲透
07 Nov 2019, 07:12 by 蕭家怡


我們想讓你知道的是支持獨立的媒體、支持專業的記者、支持有質素的報導，變得重要——寸土必爭，因為我們所失的，可能已經是所有。



星島新聞集團上星期五宣布，正與對公司有興趣之潛在獨立投資者進行磋商，對此，董事會亦戴了頭盔，指磋商可能成事，亦可能不成事。但拋開這次賣盤可能牽涉到集團掌權人的自身考慮以及股票市場操作，單是「媒體賣盤」這事，已令我想起了早前讀的《紅色滲透：中國媒體全球擴張的真相》。
《紅色滲透》一書由著名的媒體人及政治、經濟學學者何清漣所著，由名字可見，談的就是中國媒體在全世界的擴張，那何以星島賣盤會令我想起這書呢？就在於作者在書中提到，中國「大外宣」的執行方法。



《紅色滲透：中國媒體全球擴張的真相》封面


簡單來說，這方法離不開一個「買」字。國家級的媒體在外地建立分社、辦公室，用錢「買」空間；高薪聘請在地的傳媒人才，務求用當地人感興趣的形式將訊息傳達，用錢「買」人才；一些亞非窮困國家的記者，則以奬學金、貴賓式招待、採訪特權等來建立關係，用錢「買」人心，當然，還有一招就是：連人帶舖把你買下。《星島日報》正正屬於此一例子。
書中的第四章「香港回歸後媒體的喉舌化」就有談到此事。作者順著歷史的發展，試圖將港英時期、回歸後的媒體情況還原，而談到「愛國富商」在回歸後的辦媒體熱情時，《星島日報》就是案例。作者指出，《星島日報》由東南亞華僑富商胡文虎於1938年創辦，2004年時，胡文虎的女兒胡仙把股權賣給泛華集團，而泛華集體則是由親中色彩濃厚的何柱國擁有；透過支持親中商人收購媒體，以在商場上明買明賣的方式，將控制之手伸進媒體當中。當然，《星島日報》絕對不是唯一，放眼遠望，《南華早報》、《明報》、TVB的故事，其實也相似無比。
所以，當有人說：我不看《星島日報》、《頭條日報》只用來墊枱、《東周刊》更是久未拿上手，從而推論星島賣盤一事註定告吹時，我卻覺得，只要有國家支持，媒體集團還是會有價有市的。
以上所談的，不是危言聳聽，而是明明白白發生在我們眼前的事，也正因如此，支持獨立的媒體、支持專業的記者、支持有質素的報導，才變得如斯重要——寸土必爭，因為我們所失的，可能已經是所有。

Sold by Sing Tao, remembering the red penetration of the media
07 Nov 2019, 07:12 by Xiao Jiayi


What we want you to know is to support independent media, support professional journalists, and support quality reports. It becomes important – we must fight for it, because what we have lost may be all.



Sing Tao News Group announced last Friday that it is negotiating with potential independent investors interested in the company. The board of directors also wears a helmet, which may or may not be a matter of consultation. But abandoning this sale may involve the group's own considerations and stock market operations. The single ""media selling"" has reminded me of the ""Red Infiltration: The Truth of Global Expansion of Chinese Media"". .
The book ""Red Penetration"" is written by the famous media person and political and economics scholar He Qingyi. It can be seen from the name. It is about the expansion of Chinese media in the world. Why does the sale of Sing Taos remind me of this book? It is in the book that the author mentioned the implementation method of China's ""big foreign propaganda"".



""Red Infiltration: The Truth of the Global Expansion of Chinese Media"" Cover


Simply put, this method is inseparable from a ""buy"" word. National-level media set up branches and offices in the field to “buy” space with money; hire high-paying media talents in the locality to communicate with the locals in a form of interest, and “buy” talents with money; some Asian and African poor countries The reporters use the scholarships, VIP hospitality, interview privileges, etc. to establish relationships and use money to ""buy"" people's hearts. Of course, there is another trick: even people bring you to buy. ""Sing Tao Daily"" is just one example of this.
The fourth chapter of the book, ""The mouthpiece of the media after the return of Hong Kong"", talks about this. Following the development of history, the author tries to restore the media situation during the British and British period and after the reunification. When talking about the enthusiasm of the media after the return of the ""patriotic wealthy businessmen"", ""Sing Tao Daily"" is a case. The author pointed out that ""Sing Tao Daily"" was founded in 1938 by Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman in Southeast Asia. In 2004, Hu Wenhu's daughter Hu Xian sold the shares to the Fanhua Group, while the Fanhua Group was owned by He Zhuguo, a pro-China-speaking group; Support pro-Chinese businessmen to buy media, in the way of buying and selling in the mall, the control hand into the media. Of course, ""Sing Tao Daily"" is definitely not the only one. Looking at the distance, the stories of ""South China Morning Post"", ""Ming Pao"" and TVB are actually very similar.
Therefore, when someone said: I don’t watch the ""Sing Tao Daily"" and ""Headline Daily"" used only for the stage, ""East Weekly"" has not been used for a long time, so that the sale of Sing Tao is destined to blow, I think, as long as there is State support, the media group still has a price to have a market.
What I have talked about above is not an alarmist, but a clear-cut thing that happened before our eyes. It is precisely because of this that supporting independent media, supporting professional journalists, and supporting quality reports has become so important. Fight, because what we have lost, may already be all.
