        <i>Should I do my research into tariffs before I get the car or get the car first?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Like a lot of car owners, I’m thinking about replacing my diesel car with one powered by battery. I’ve identified a model that I’d like, but I’m puzzled by the infrastructure I’ll need. As far as I can tell, it’d be cheapest to charge the car overnight, using a suitable tariff like Economy 7. But I’m reluctant to commit to installing a charger until I’ve worked out what to do next.</b>

        <b>Should I check with my energy supplier first to see if it has a suitable tariff, or go ahead and get the charger installed in the hope that I can find a suitable tariff afterwards. Or should I just buy the car and sort out </b>
        <b>charging issues later?</b>

      <p>Your caution is understandable since electric cars, while promoted by the government for their green credentials, made up only 1.1% of car sales this year and, although cheaper to run, they cost more than the average traditional car to buy.</p>
      <p>For pioneers like you, there’s the issue of rapidly evolving battery and charging technologies and the dearth of public charging points. According to David Lewis, founder of the advice website <a href="https://electriccarhome.co.uk/">electriccarhome</a>, the cost of charging depends on where, when and how often, you charge. Charging at home overnight on an off-peak tariff would cost 5p per kWh rising to 30p at a motorway service station. At work, or at a hotel, it could be free if you have an obliging employer or all-in deal.</p>
      <p>A number of energy companies offer cheap night-time rates for electric car owners, depending on where you live.</p>
      <p>Find the provider first, preferably an eco-friendly one since that’s the whole point, and get a free smart meter installed before you bring the car home. If you have off-street parking, it’s safer and faster to get a dedicated charging point installed and you get a £500 government grant towards the cost.</p>
      <p>Lewis advises asking your electricity supplier to confirm that the type of charging point you have in mind is “smart” enough to charge automatically during the off-peak charging window. Once you’re up and running that 5p off-peak tariff could buy you 10,000 miles for around £132 a year.</p>
