""The state of the economy in the country is bad. The service sector has fallen flat. Employment is decreasing. Those ruling are busy in themselves and the people are suffering on every front,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi.
Taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said while he held his ""Howdy Mody"" event in the US, the Americans have reduced H-1B visas for Indians seeking to work there.



""The question that everyone should ask the BJP government is that who is being benefitted during their tenure.
