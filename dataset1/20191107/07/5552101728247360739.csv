南投縣國姓鄉國道六號東行線「國姓一號」隧道事故頻仍，兩天前，才發生隧道裡火燒車事件，今天同一路段又發生七車連環撞事故，造成兩名民眾受傷送醫，目前已無大礙，事故發生時，警方封鎖一個車道，造成國道車流回堵一、兩公里，目前車潮已經抒解，初步研判，這起車禍係肇事車輛未保持安全距離而追撞。
兩天前，國道6號東行線「國姓一號隧道」指標近19K處，有部小貨車，疑似電瓶電線走火，車子自體燃燒，駕駛倉皇逃出時，整部車子陷入火海，而今天中午，幾乎同一路段，又發生七車連環撞事故。

目擊者指出，當時隧道內外側車道施工封閉，只剩內側車道可通行，中午一點半左右，一部小貨車疑似未保持安全距離，追撞前車，造成前後共七部車輛連環撞！兩位民眾受傷，經送埔里基督教醫院急救，目前均無生命危險，但仍得住院觀察。

這起車禍，造成後方車流回堵達1、2公里，兩個小時後才排除事故，解除車道封閉，車流也逐漸舒緩，警方也提醒路過駕駛人保持適當車速與車距，以策安全。
