Manchester United's Europa League journey continues as they take on Partizan Belgrade.
Although The Red Devils’ Premier League campaign has been underwhelming, they top Europa League Group L on seven points and a win in this tie confirms their progression to the knockout stages.
Despite having 61 percent possession against Partizan two weeks ago, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men only managed to muster one shot on target in the entire 90 minutes.
Anthony Martial’s penalty was the difference between the sides last time out, but United fans will be hoping the game is more of a formality on home soil.
