      <p>We thought nobody could beat M&amp;S when it came to seasonal showstoppers, but <a href="https://fave.co/2YV2C8V">Morrisons</a> has just launched a Chocolate Orange Gin Liqueur that shimmers with bronze and gold glitter when you shake the bottle.</p>
      <p>As part of <a href="https://fave.co/32zXlCT">Marks and Spencer’s Christmas menu</a> , the high street favourite recently released the Clementine Gin Liqueur Snow Globe - a £15 tasty tipple with a festive flavour that comes complete with edible 23 carat gold leaf pieces.</p>
      <p>And when the bottle is turned, the pieces float, creating a snow globe effect, making the drink an amazing gift or a conversation-starting centrepiece.</p>

      <p>Morrisons Chocolate Orange flavour Gin Liqueur combines the zesty and refreshing flavour of orange with indulgent, velvety chocolate, as well as tasting festive - it also looks the part too, shimmering with bronze and gold glitter when you shake it.</p>
      <p>As it's a gin liqueur, it's got a slightly lower alcohol content, with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 20 per cent.</p>
