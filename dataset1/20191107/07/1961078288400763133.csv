Kentucky Blues
President Trump campaigned for Matt Bevin, the Republican governor of Kentucky, ahead of Tuesday’s vote. As of Wednesday night, Bevin was down 5,000 votes but refused to concede to his Democratic challenger, Andy Beshear. The result in Kentucky mirrored races across the country, in which Democrats made strides in typically red areas.

“He was ahead by five points in the polls last week. Then Trump showed up to support him and he lost, which was embarrassing.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Team Trump was in full spin mode today. His campaign said he just about dragged Bevin across the finish line, and Trump himself tweeted multiple times that he almost helped the Republican win the governor’s race. This is like the Astros bragging they almost won the World Series: ‘We won three out of the seven games!’” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Democrats just picked up a governorship in a state as red as Trump’s face when he heard about this.” — SAMANTHA BEE“This is Trump’s worst nightmare come true. I mean, his second-worst nightmare, after the one where he’s chased by stairs and salads.” — SAMANTHA BEE“Bevin lost by about 5,000 votes, and as of this morning, he refused to concede defeat. Yeah. He will not, proving once again that Republicans are the party of men who won’t go away after you say no.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“It was a really humiliating result for Trump. He endorsed the losing Republican candidate. Or, as Trump puts it, ‘No, I didn’t.’” — JAMES CORDEN
The Punchiest Punchlines (Middle Finger Edition)
[Reading from The New York Times] “‘Democrats control both chambers in the state legislature and the governor’s office for the first time since 1993.’ Oh yeah, baby! The ’90s. The ’90s are back, baby. Everybody in Virginia is going to get a Crystal Pepsi and a Blockbuster video card.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“From red to blue. And remember, this is in a place where the governor’s face went from white to black.” — TREVOR NOAH“Perhaps the biggest victory belongs to a woman named Juli Briskman, who lost her job for flipping off Trump’s motorcade two years ago. Well, last night Briskman got a new job because she was elected supervisor in Loudoun County, Va. So Virginia’s got a new county supervisor and a new state bird.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“Yeah, that finger launched her political career.” — TREVOR NOAH“She did extremely well with young, educated voters and she completely swept the road rage demographic.” — JAMES CORDEN“People didn’t even need to hear her policies. Once they knew she was the person who flipped off Trump, they were like, ‘She’s got my vote.’” — JAMES CORDEN“Just imagine if she had mooned him — she would be governor by now.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
