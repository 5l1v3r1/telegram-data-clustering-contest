07 Nov 2019, 07:10 by RFI

Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, has officially launched his Conservative party campaign in a city that, historically, is the stronghold of Labor's main opposition party while vowing to complete the Brexit process if he wins.

Speaking to supporters of the party, Boris asked them to cast votes that would enable him to gain more members of Parliament so that he could complete the process of withdrawing from the European Union.
For his part, the opposition leader of the Labor party, Jeremy Corbyn, said if he was elected he would make sure he brought about the real change that the Conservatives failed.
Several parties also launched their campaign after Prime Minister Boris submitted a letter to Queen Elizabeth informing her of the December 12 General Election.
