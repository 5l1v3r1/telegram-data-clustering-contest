To have them in BiKi’s industry circle now is indeed a privilege. At Singapore Blockchain Week’s opening event, they will be able to provide great insights to the audience on intriguing topics like “How to Disrupt the Chinese Crypto Exchange Market” and “Blockchain Investments in 2020” which is such a value-add to our audience.
