        <b>Conan is the nickname of a military dog which took part in and was injured during the US military operation in north Syria against the leader and founder of Daesh* Abu al-Baghdadi that resulted in his death on 26 October.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday in a political campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana, that Conan would attend the White House ‘very soon’.</p>
      <blockquote>"He's coming to the White House very soon… I said, 'bring him now,' they said, 'He's on a mission.' I said, 'You gotta be kidding. Come on, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910311077184558-video-pentagon-holds-briefing-on-baghdadi-raid-releases-surveillance-footage/">give him couple of days rest</a>, please,” said Trump.</blockquote>
      <p>Trump called the dog, which he claims got injured while taking down Daesh’s leader al-Baghdadi, a great hero.</p>
      <blockquote>"You know who the real hero is, forget about Trump, the dog was the great hero, Conan," Trump remarked.</blockquote>
      <p>While celebrating the dog’s heroism, Trump <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911011077203529-russian-foreign-minister-calls-daesh-leader-baghdadi-us-brainchild/">sent a message to the fighters of the terrorist group</a>, whom he referred to as ‘bloodthirsty savages’, that they “don't stand a chance against the might of the United States military”</p>
      <p>On 27 October, Trump announced that Daesh* leader <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077208499-no-one-seems-to-know-how-trump-learned-that-daesh-chief-baghdadi-died-a-crying-death/">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed</a> in a raid executed by US Special Operations Forces in Syria’s Idlib province.</p>
