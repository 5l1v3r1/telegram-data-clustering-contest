Uchunguzi unaofanywa na wabunge umejikita katika madai kuwa rais Trump alimshinikiza rais wa Ukrain kutangaza hadharani kuanza uchunguzi dhidi ya mpinzani wake Joe Biden.

Criminal case against Trump: Open interview begins November 13
07 Nov 2019, 07:24 by RFI

Democrats of the Democrats have announced the start of an open interview starting next week in an investigation that could see president Donald Trump being removed from office.

Their statement indicated that three senior officials from the ministry of foreign affairs would testify, after being secretly interviewed for weeks.
The parliamentary inquiry is based on allegations that President Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to publicly announce the investigation against his rival Joe Biden.
Intelijensia committee chairman Adam Schiff, who oversees the process, told reporters that all procedures had been completed and they had also published documents of interviews with witnesses to be called.
President Trump has in turn criticized the process initiated by Democrats saying there was no mistake he made during his speech with the president of Ukraine, a statement backed by some of his party's parliamentarians.
