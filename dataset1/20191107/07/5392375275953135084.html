      <p>In the official renders released over on Weibo, we can finally have a look at real design of the device. The Vivo S5 comes with a OLED display and a camera hole in upper right corner. We see these two technologies together for the first time on a Chinese phone. The only other devices with this tech are indeed the Samsung S10 and Note 10 series.</p>
      <p>The render also confirms a very talked about aspect of the phone: its camera configuration. The Vivo S5 does indeed appear to feature a diamond-shaped camera setup. In particular, we see three cameras in the diamond at the center and a flash, plus an additional one just below.</p>

      <p>So, Vivo will be bringing something different in this market filled with either iPhone X or Huawei Mate 20 clones (weâ€™re talking about the camera setup alone).</p>
      <p>As for the resolutions of all these cameras. We currently know the primary rear shooter will have a resolution of 48MP. Meanwhile the camera at the front will be able to snap 32MP high res selfies.</p>
      <p>Finally, the only other spec on the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/22/vivo-s5-appears-in-video-by-mistake-during-an-interview/">Vivo S5</a> we know from a previous certification is the support for 22.5W fast charging.</p>
