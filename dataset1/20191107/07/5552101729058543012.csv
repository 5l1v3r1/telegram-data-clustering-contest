63歲的日本資深諧星田代政因持有毒品，於昨（6日）遭到警方逮捕！19年前他曾用手機偷拍女性裙底被捕，後又因染上毒癮2度進出監獄，沒想到他出獄後再犯，前科累累極有可能被判重刑。
根據日媒報導，田代政今年8月23日投宿宮城縣鹽竈市旅館時，宮城縣警方於隔日接到旅館通報「有客人忘記可疑物品」，於6日在田代政位於東京杉並區的住宅逮捕他，並在他身上搜出毒品，5度因涉毒被逮。
田代政在80年代曾是人氣節目《志村大爆笑》的固定班底，和志村健交情匪淺，但他2000年後屢爆醜聞，不但因偷拍女性裙底被捕，甚至淪為毒蟲，遭到東家炒魷魚後演藝事業全毀。

2004年田代政因涉毒被判有期徒刑3年半，老婆也在他入獄服刑期間與他離婚，2011年他再度因長期服毒被判刑3年半，2014年7月獲釋後，隔年在網誌公開謝罪，並聲稱將戒毒「改過自新」，最近則以自身經驗協助毒癮患者回歸社會的活動，獲得綜藝節目旁白的工作。
