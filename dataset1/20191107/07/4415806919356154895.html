      <p>Andre Drummond got 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists as the Detroit Pistons routed the New York Knicks 122-102.</p>
      <p>Tony Snell added 24 points and Markieff Morris got 22 as Detroit made light of the fact that they were played without the injured trio of Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose and Reggie Jackson.</p>
      <p>The Pistons have now won their last eight games against the Knicks.</p>
      <p>The latest loss drops the Knicks to an NBA-worst of 1-7, while the Pistons are now 4-5 and lie in eighth place in the Eastern Conference.</p>

      <p>In Atlanta the Hawks lost 113-93 to the Chicago Bulls, in a game that saw Tomas Satoransky score a career-high 27 points.</p>
      <p>It was just the Bulls’ third win in nine games this season and they lie in 11th place in the East, two places below the Hawks.</p>
      <p>Atlanta’s coach Lloyd Pierce did not mince his words after the match. “The only positive from this game: It’s over,” he said. “We don’t have to worry about it anymore.”</p>
