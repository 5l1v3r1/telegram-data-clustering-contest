防干預台灣選舉　臉書將強制揭露廣告出資者
07 Nov 2019, 07:49 by 謝文哲
2020年中華民國總統副總統及立法委員選舉將至，臉書於今年初就在台展開選舉觀察，昨（6日）正式宣布11月中旬起將強制執行揭露廣告出資者的作法，而且限定僅用台灣人申請的帳號和新台幣，才能刊登政治相關廣告。
根據《中央社》報導，臉書主管表示為對抗不實資訊，臉書將採取3大政策：移除、降低與告知。「移除」是指違反社群規範者刪帳號，今年第一季就移除了22億個假帳號；「降低」則是與第三方事實查核單位合作，以機器學習方式偵測假訊息，「降低」假消息散布的機會；一旦有人要分享假消息，臉書會跳出警示「告知」，避免假消息繼續被散布。
為了維護台灣選舉公正性，臉書正積極增加廣告透明度，並預告11月中旬將會強制執行要求管理員和出資者提供身分認定，用戶都可以看到，並且強調「這功能是為確保只有台灣人申請的帳號和新台幣，才可以刊登政治相關廣告」，鎖定台灣的廣告主都得先完成廣告授權程序，才能刊登社會議題、政治或選舉的廣告。
