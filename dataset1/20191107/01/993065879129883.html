      <p>THERE have been almost 100 attacks on Irish language signs in the Mid Ulster council area in two years - with CCTV erected at one sign targeted 12 times in recent months.</p>
      <p>Councillors are to hold a meeting with the PSNI to discuss the campaign of vandalism.</p>
      <p>The council last night confirmed that from June 2017 to mid-October this year there have been 93 “incidences of vandalism” involving dual language signs.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin councillor John McNamee, who sits on its environment committee, said the damage is "costing tens of thousands to the ratepayers".</p>
      <p>He said police will attend a specially arranged meeting with committee members in Cookstown next week.</p>

      <p>“One of the key outcomes of this meeting will be to get the police to deal with this,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The ratepayers are paying for it.”</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman revealed that one dual language sign near the village of Gulladuff in Co Derry has been damaged 12 times since February.</p>
      <p>It is understood signs have been defaced and pulled from the ground.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year The Irish News reported how household rubbish was also dumped beside a sign.</p>
      <p>A camera has since been put up in the area in a bid to catch the culprits.</p>
      <p>The council spokeswoman confirmed that CCTV was erected temporarily at Gulladuff Hill, “a site which had experienced illegal dumping as well as repeated damage to a street sign".</p>
      <p>“However, the monitoring produced no results,” she said.</p>

      <p>UUP councillor Trevor Wilson last night said “it’s important to attend this meeting to find out exactly the extent of this across the whole district”.</p>
      <p>He raised concerns about other signs being targeted, including road signs bearing the name ‘Londonderry’, and claimed that Irish language signs had been put up on council-owned facilities in mainly unionist areas.</p>
      <p>“I do condemn all acts of vandalism but to put dual language signs in Protestant areas where signs were never erected before, even in English, is antagonising at the least,” he said.</p>
      <p>William Lennox from the British Truth Forum, which has in the past criticised council action over flags and bonfires, also claimed "they have brought it on themselves".</p>
      <p>"I don't see why they need a special camera to look after road signs."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for police said: "PSNI can confirm that local officers have accepted an invitation to a meeting organised by Mid Ulster council next week."</p>
