BACK IN THE DAY

The Irish News: - November 7 2009: Paul McCloskey announced himself on the European boxing scene last night as the Dungiven man sauntered his way to the European light welterweight championship title with a ninth-round knockout of Spain’s Daniel Rasilla.
Three thousand people, including Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, packed the Meadowbank Sports Arena in Magherafelt to roar on ‘Dudey’, and the 30-year-old returned the compliment with the minimum of fuss in front of the Sky Sports cameras, knocking Rasilla out two minutes and 15 seconds into the ninth.
Rasilla, a last minute replacement for France's ex-world champion Souleymane M'baye, who pulled out at the start of the week, offered little resistance throughout.
He didn’t rattle the southpaw and McCloskey needed just two more rounds to become the first Derryman to be crowned a European champion since Charlie Nash claimed the European lightweight title in 1979.
But there was disappointment for Belfast’s Martin Rogan as his bid to win back the Commonwealth heavyweight title from Sam Sexton ended in despair after he
was forced to retire at the end of the sixth round at the Odyssey in Belfast.
