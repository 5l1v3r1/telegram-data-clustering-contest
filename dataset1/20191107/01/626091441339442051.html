      <h1>A Ton of People Received Text Messages Overnight That Were Originally Sent on Valentine's Day</h1>

      <p>Something strange is happening with text messages in the US right now. Overnight, a multitude of people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay">received text messages that appear to have originally been sent on or around Valentine's Day 2019</a>. From a report:<i> These people never received the text messages in the first place; the people who sent the messages had no idea that they had never been received, and they did nothing to attempt to resend them overnight. Delayed messages were sent from and received by both iPhones and Android phones, and the messages seem to have been sent and received across all major carriers in the US. Many of the complaints involve T-Mobile or Sprint, although AT&amp;T and Verizon have been mentioned as well. People using regional US carriers, carriers in Canada, and even Google Voice also seem to have experienced delays. At fault seems to be a system that multiple cell carriers use for messaging. A Sprint spokesperson said a "maintenance update" last night caused the error.</i></p>
