UFC 245: Usman vs. Covington fight card
07 Nov 2019, 01:30 by Mookie Alexander
The final UFC pay-per-view of 2019 is a doozy. There are three title fights on tap at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, headlined by a welterweight title grudge match between champion Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington. In the co-main, Max Holloway defends his featherweight crown versus Australia’s Alex Volkanovski, and the first of three championship bouts features two-division champ Amanda Nunes putting her women’s bantamweight belt on the line against former 145 lbs champ Germaine de Randamie.
But wait, there’s more! Legendary former featherweight king Jose Aldo drops down to bantamweight to face Marlon Moraes, while bantamweight sensation Petr Yan squares off with Urijah Faber. Oh, and you also have a newly announced slugfest between Geoff Neal and Mike Perry, as well as a big women’s flyweight bout for Viviane Araujo against Jessica Eye. Hell, there’s also Matt Brown vs. Ben Saunders, which is a fight I swear had already happened, but evidently that’s not the case!
There’s no bout order yet, but I think we have a full fight lineup for December 14th. Here’s what UFC 245 looks like:
Kamaru Usman vs. Colby CovingtonMax Holloway vs. Alex VolkanovskiAmanda Nunes vs. Germaine de RandamieMarlon Moraes vs. Jose AldoUrijah Faber vs. Petr YanGeoff Neal vs. Mike PerryJessica Eye vs. Viviane AraujoBrandon Moreno vs. Kai Kara-FranceOmari Akhmedov vs. Ian HeinischPunahele Soriano vs. Oskar PiechotaChase Hooper vs. Daniel TeymurMatt Brown vs. Ben Saunders
