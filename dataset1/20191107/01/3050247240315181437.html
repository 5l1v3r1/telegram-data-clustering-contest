      <h1>Bitcoin Buyers for Square’s Cash App Doubled in Q3 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:44:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:44</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>According to its Q3 2019 shareholder letter, Square’s Cash App reported many new first-time Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) buyers, but low profits related to its Bitcoin business.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 6, payment processing giant Square issued a <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2019/Q3/2019-Q3-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf">letter</a> to shareholders outlining Q3 2019 financial figures, in which it disclosed that the total net revenue for its Cash App was $307 million, while the gross profit resulted in $123 million for Q3.</p>
      <h3>First-time BTC buyers have almost doubled</h3>
      <p>Square’s Cash App saw $148 million in Bitcoin revenue. However, the company endured a whopping $146 million in Bitcoin costs during the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in only $2 million profit on Bitcoin sales during the same time period.</p>
      <p>Despite the low profit margin on BTC sales, more and more users are apparently finding their way to the  Square’s Cash App as a means to invest in Bitcoin. Ever since the company introduced the redesigned Cash App’s customer interface, product adoption of Bitcoin and Cash Card has increased significantly. The letter stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“First-time Bitcoin buyers have approximately doubled and Cash Card orders have seen a meaningful uplift.”</blockquote>
      <p>The shareholder letter further points out that in the third quarter of 2019, total net revenue grew 44% year-over-year to $1.27 billion, and adjusted revenue grew 40% year-over-year to $602 million. Net income was $29 million in the Q3 2019, compared to a net income of $20 million in the Q3 2018.</p>
      <p>The Cash App, Square’s popular payments app, was initially designed to facilitate the transfer of fiat currency but soon started supporting cryptocurrency trading.</p>
      <p>Square’ Cash Card is a free business debit card that enables sellers to spend their funds as soon as they make a sale. When a seller takes a payment, the proceeds immediately go into their Square stored balance, which can then be spent or withdrawn from an ATM.</p>
      <h3>Buy a fraction of Berkshire Stock </h3>
      <p>Square App has continued to expand beyond its initial purpose as a payments app. Recently, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/jack-dorsey-you-can-buy-a-fraction-of-berkshire-stock-or-stack-sats">announced</a> that Square’s Cash App is poised to enable users to purchase fractions of stocks — with an entry of as little as $1. Dorsey wrote: </p>
      <blockquote>“Now anyone can buy $42 or even $1 worth of Berkshire Hathaway A ($BRK.A, or $TSLA or $SFIX or…) instantly and for free right in @CashApp. Really proud of the team for making buying stocks and building wealth accessible to more people. Rolling out now!”</blockquote>
      <p>Dorsey also pointed out that users who are not into stocks can buy fractions of Bitcoin using the same interface.</p>
