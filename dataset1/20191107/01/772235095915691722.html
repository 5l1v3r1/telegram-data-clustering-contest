      <p><b>Tesla</b> will reveal its <b>electric ute</b> on <b>November 21</b>, as it prepares to take on the Rivian R1T and upcoming pure-electric Ford F-150.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> used Twitter to reveal the "Cybertruck" will be unwrapped in Los Angeles, near the SpaceX rocket factory. If that date sounds familiar, it's because <i>Blade Runner</i> references it â€“ and it's smack-bang in the middle of the Los Angeles motor show's media days.</p>
      <p>The company has revealed precious few details about its upcoming pickup, but we know it should cost <b>less than US$50,000 ($72,000)</b> and be capable of hauling 136 tonnes, although what that means for real-world tow ratings remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>A range between 650km and 800km has been tabled, which hints at a battery significantly larger than 100kWh.</p>
      <p>Of course, it remains to be seen if the ute will look anything like the fan-made speculative rendering pictured atop this story. (Source unknown.)</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/rivian/">Rivian</a> has positioned itself as a leader in the electric light-commercial space, promising to offer the R1T dual-cab ute in Australia by 2022.</p>
      <p>With a range of <b>643km</b> and claimed towing capacity of <b>4500kg,</b> the R1T has a towing capabilities north of those offered by conventional internal-combustion dual-cab utes.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more on the Tesla ute in the lead-up to its launch.</p>
