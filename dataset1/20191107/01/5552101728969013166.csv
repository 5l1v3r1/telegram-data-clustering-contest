下半天東北風增強　北台灣變天轉濕涼
07 Nov 2019, 01:57 by 徐文鴻, 攝影組
今（7）日下半天東北季風開始增強，北台灣有明顯轉涼的感覺，根據中央氣象局資料顯示，迎風面北部及東半部降雨機率提高，甚至還有局部大雨發生的可能，中南部仍維持多雲到晴，各地早晚低溫落在19至22度，提醒大家要留意較大的日夜溫差，記得隨身攜帶衣物適時調整。
針對午後東北風略為增強，氣象達人彭啟明也於臉書po文分析，指北部感受較明顯，北東迎風面會偶有陣雨，預估週六（9日）東北風減弱將轉乾轉晴，不過要留意輻射冷卻，清晨低溫可能落在19至20度間。
至於空氣品質方面，北部及東半部地區擴散條件佳，雲嘉南以南位於下風處汙染物易累積，加上光化反應明顯，細懸浮微粒會明顯增加，接近到敏感族群不健康等級，高屏局部地區甚至短時間可能達紅色警示等級，敏感族群要稍加留意。
而中颱哈隆與輕颱娜克莉未來也對台灣無影響，中颱哈隆將持續往北移動，輕颱娜克莉則預期緩慢的往越南方向接近，南部可能雲量會稍多一些。

The northeast wind strengthened in the second half of the day.

In the second half of the day (7), the northeast monsoon began to strengthen, and northern Taiwan has a feeling of turning cold. According to the Central Meteorological Administration, the probability of rain in the north and east of the windward side is increasing, and even local heavy rain may occur. It is still cloudy to sunny, and the temperature falls between 19 and 22 degrees in the morning and evening. It reminds everyone to pay attention to the large temperature difference between day and night. Remember to carry the clothes in time to adjust.
In the afternoon, the northeast wind was slightly enhanced. The meteorologist Peng Qiming also analyzed the Facebook essay. It means that the northern part feels more obvious. The northeast windward surface will occasionally have showers. It is estimated that the northeast wind will weaken and turn fine on Saturday (9th). However, be aware of radiant cooling, which may fall between 19 and 20 degrees in the early morning.
As for the air quality, the diffusion conditions in the northern and eastern half are good. The pollutants in the downwind are easy to accumulate in the south of Yunjia South, and the photochemical reaction is obvious. The fine aerosols will increase significantly, which is close to the unhealthy level of sensitive groups. Local areas of high-screen may reach red warning levels even in a short period of time, and sensitive groups should pay more attention.
The middle platform Halong and the light Taiwan Na Keli will have no influence on Taiwan in the future. The middle platform Halong will continue to move northward. The light platform Na Keli is expected to approach the direction of Vietnam slowly, and the cloud may be slightly more in the south.
