Deal: Protect your computer with Cylance Smart Antivirus for $29

07 Nov 2019, 01:00




Hackers are more skilled than ever. All they want to do is steal your information, whatever it takes. Get defensive and kick your cybersecurity up a notch with a Cylance Smart Antivirus two-year subscription for only $29.
Cylance is more advanced than traditional antivirus software. It does not rely on byte matching or heuristics to spot a hacker, but rather advanced machine learning to protect your system. It only makes sense to use advanced antivirus to beat advanced hackers.
Set it, forget it, and protect your digital presence.
The worst part about traditional antivirus software is the tendency to run a scan at the most inconvenient time. You’re gaming or watching a movie, you get a security popup, and suddenly your system is at a crawl. Cylance runs quietly in the background, taking down threats before they can infect your computer.
One of the most secure benefits of Cylance is that it operates independently of the cloud. Nobody can access flaws in your security when your system is tightly contained. Cylance works with any operating system from Windows 7 or Mac OS X Mavericks onward.
Cylance Smart Antivirus highlights:

Prevention focused design stops threats at runtime.
AI-based predictive advantage protects against never-before-seen threats.
Runs without popups, scans, or performance impacts.
Get a bird’s eye view of your system from an intuitive interface.
Operates on your device independently of the cloud.

McAfee security can cost up to $100 per year, and Norton can cost $60 per year, but neither one offers the advanced AI features of Cylance Smart Antivirus. A two-year subscription to Cylance retails at $58, but this deal provides all of that protection for just $29.
This deal will disappear soon, but hackers keep getting better. Upgrade your protection via the button below.

Get the deal!
