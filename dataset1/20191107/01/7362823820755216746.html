      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-history-attorney-general">Kentucky Attorney General-elect Daniel Cameron</a> reflected on his historic victory on Tuesday, telling "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Story</a>" one particular president inspired him to seek public service.</p>
      <p>Cameron, a Republican who became the first African-American to be elected the state's attorney general, told host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-story">Martha MacCallum</a> Abraham Lincoln was someone he always looked up to.</p>
      <p>"I grew up in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Harden County, which is not too far from the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln," Cameron said.</p>
      <p>"And so, he's always been someone who has inspired my interests in public service. And so, it was a great honor, again, to be elected as the attorney general last evening.</p>

      <p>"I hope that folks that look like me, regardless candidly of their political affiliation, not only look at me and say that, you know, I want to vote for him at the ballot box, but also make the decision that perhaps they want to put their name up for public service and for public office."</p>
      <p>Cameron said it was "thrill" to run for statewide office, and that he is excited to defend and enforce the laws of the state.</p>
      <p>He added earlier Wednesday, he was already holding meetings with his staff and expressed gratitude to those who came out to vote for him.</p>
      <p>Endorsed by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, Cameron was previously a legal counsel to Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mitch-mcconnell">Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.</a>,</p>
      <p>To that extent, MacCallum asked whether he would consider one day running to be the eventual successor to the senior senator from Kentucky.</p>
      <p>"We want to do a good job in serving in this role," Cameron replied.</p>

      <p>"I was honored to have the endorsement of the Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police, and they expect me to really advocate for our law enforcement community for a commonwealth and county attorneys. I had the opportunity to serve as Senator McConnell's legal counsel in D.C. and it was a phenomenal and transformative experience. I'm grateful for his service to the Commonwealth, and I hope that the Kentuckians will make a determination that he needs to be reelected next year."</p>
