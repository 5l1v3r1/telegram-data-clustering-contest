      <p>OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — Burkina Faso’s prime minister says his county is in shock following the attack by gunmen which killed at least 37 employees traveling to a Canadian-owned mine.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Christophe Dabire, in a tweet Thursday, said the West African country is still reeling from the news of the attack and sent his condolences to the families of those killed.</p>
      <p>The attack on Wednesday happened about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the Boungou mine, owned Canada’s Semafo company, in eastern Burkina Faso. The gunmen attacked a convoy of five buses carrying mine employees and which was accompanied by a military escort.</p>
      <p>The area has become dangerous for Semafo, which operates two gold mines in Burkina Faso.</p>
