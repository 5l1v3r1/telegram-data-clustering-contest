      <h1>Alberta private members bill to reopen debate on physician conscience rights</h1>

      <p>EDMONTON - Alberta politicians are to debate the role of conscience rights and the responsibilities of physicians asked to assist or advise on abortions, contraception or medically assisted deaths.</p>
      <p>United Conservative backbencher Dan Williams is to introduce Thursday a private member's bill to reassert the Charter-protected freedom of conscience and religion for health providers.</p>
      <p>Williams says the bill is in response to an Appeal Court of Ontario ruling this spring.</p>
      <p>Ontario's high court affirmed a lower court ruling that found physicians who object on moral grounds to contentious issues like abortion must offer patients an "effective referral" to another health provider.</p>
      <p>The court called it a fair compromise, but groups such as Canadian Physicians for Life say it is still an intolerable violation of their rights.</p>
      <p>Currently, the College of Physicians of Surgeons of Alberta directs doctors who do not wish to provide these services to offer patients timely access to either a member or a service that can.</p>
