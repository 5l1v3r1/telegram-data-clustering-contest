      <h1>Whistleblower's attorney warned Trump a ‘coup is coming’ in 2017 tweets</h1>

      <p>The Ukraine whistleblower’s attorney Mark Zaid has been warning President Trump of a pending coup since 2017.</p>
      <p>Zaid has been a critic of the president long before he was hired to represent the whistleblower that triggered the House impeachment proceeding.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Zaid tweeted that Trump was facing a “rebellion” that would eventually lead to impeachment.</p>

      <p>Zaid’s tweets came as Trump announced that Trump had fired Deputy Attorney General <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sally-yates-fired-by-trump-calls-on-the-nation-to-honor-the-rule-of-law"><u>Sally Yates</u></a> for refusing to enforce executive policies.</p>
      <p>Zaid became a pivotal member of Trump’s impeachment by representing the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Despite calls from Trump and others for the whistleblower to be identified and provide an impeachment testimony, Zaid has maintained that the whistleblower will remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>He called any efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/pinnacle-of-irresponsibility-attorneys-decline-to-confirm-cia-officer-eric-ciaramella-is-whistleblower"><u>identify the whistleblower</u></a> the “pinnacle of irresponsibility.”</p>
