      <p>PARIS (AP) — French police have carried out a large operation to dismantle makeshift migrant camps in northeast Paris.</p>
      <p>Police Prefect Didier Lallement told reporters Thursday that “1,606 people were evacuated and the site is now freed of all its occupants.”</p>
      <p>Officials say almost 600 police officers were involved in clearing up the makeshift tents set up in exhaust-fumed clad areas underneath suburban highways.</p>
      <p>Lallement said that a police presence in the areas would be maintained to stop the migrants from returning.</p>
      <p>This highly-publicized operation, the biggest in over a year, comes amid a French government pledge to “take back control” of immigration.</p>
      <p>President Emmanuel Macron has been accused of cynically trying to fend off the appeal of the far right before next year’s municipal elections.</p>
