Pensioner (72) with history of exposing himself back in court

07 Nov 2019, 01:00

A pensioner with a history of exposing himself in public has been remanded in custody.
Alex Reynolds, from College Avenue in Belfast, appeared at the city's crown court using a walking aid.
The 72-year old was charged with exposing his genitals 'intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm or distress' on May 18 this year.
When the charge was put to Reynolds by the clerk and he was asked how he pleaded, the pensioner replied, ""Oh I plead guilty, love.""
Defence barrister JonPaul Shields told Judge Philip Gilpin that Reynolds was in custody and there would be no application for bail.
The barrister also asked for pre-sentence reports, adding that Reynolds was ""familiar with probation.""
After the judge was handed a copy of his criminal record - which included previous exposure offences - he told the pensioner: ""Mr Reynolds, you have pleaded guilty to these matters. Probation will contact you to discuss the next stage, and it's important to engage with them and discuss matters with them.""
When he was told his plea would be heard on December 5, Reynolds said ""that's three days before my birthday"".
He was then remanded back into custody.
