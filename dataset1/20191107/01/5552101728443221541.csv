影委會湊合人才資方　徐若瑄拉謝盈萱打頭陣主演
07 Nov 2019, 01:43 by 娛樂組, 攝影組
台北市影委會從去年開始舉辦「台北影視音人才媒合會」，為創作者與資方提供平台直接接觸，尋求合作可能，今年已經是第2屆。上屆只想試水溫，沒想到促成近250場的會談，也有2部作品媒合成功順利籌拍，其中之一就是由徐若瑄、謝盈萱主演的《孤味》。今年影委會更樂觀預估能夠媒合成功並開拍3到5部作品，引入更多外地人才與資金進台灣。
從3月就可看見徐若瑄多次在個人IG貼出電影《孤味》開工的照片，該片在5月公布演員陣容，除了徐若瑄外，還有「俗女」謝盈萱、孫可芳、丁寧，及號稱「全民阿嬤」的陳淑芳，清一色的女性主演，且徐若瑄還與剪接大師廖慶松共同擔任監製工作。

類型豐富　可行度大增
這雖然只是徐若瑄個人數十部電影作品之一，卻是台北市影委會舉辦「台北影視音人才媒合會」，第一部經由影委會媒合創作者與資方成功，而完成拍攝的作品。該活動今年主要媒合對象為劇本創作與動畫特效人才，影委會總監饒紫娟透露，今年有超過300場以上的會談，比去年成長了25%，且劇本的類型更加擴大。


台北市影委會總監饒紫娟樂觀預估，今年將有3到5部成功媒合的作品可以在明年順利開拍。

饒紫娟表示，去年媒合會的劇本創作人還略顯青澀，但今年專業度及可執行度大增，甚至還吸引一些得獎老手，因此她樂觀預估，明年應該可以看到3至5部順利拍成的影視作品。


香港美納影視總裁李志剛認為台灣的劇本水準很高，但需要更熟悉影視法規、財管、行銷的人才。

根據觀察，今年來到媒合會的影視製作公司、資方代表都對「IP」趨之若鶩，來自香港的美納影視總裁李志剛，這2年都來尋找可以合作的劇本。李志剛認為，台灣的劇本水準很高，「就像一個很好的水果，但要有養分的泥土，水果才能長得好。」李志剛也提出建言：「台灣需要更熟悉法規、財管、行銷等統合人才，在劇本、製作以外，幫助影視業的體質更加健全。」
題材受限　來台成轉機
此外，第11屆「拍台北」電影劇本甄選活動的得獎者，也在影音媒合會上尋找適合的製作方與投資方，金劇本得主楊慈露的《貪婪演算法》，是以1999年新光保全監守自盜價值共3億元的黃金及現鈔，至今人贓均下落不明的懸案為背景，探討犯人的犯案心態。真人實事改編的故事相當受矚目，楊慈露表示已有超過10間製作公司找她會談，希望該劇本能順利拍攝成功。

中國大陸近年因太多題材無法過審，外資合拍片一旦無法上映隨時面臨慘賠，但這也成為台灣的利多，因為許多怕被波及的人才或資金反而轉進台灣，今年香港、新加坡及韓國公司都積極尋求與台灣合作，饒紫娟認為這就是台灣的轉機，看好台灣雖有兩岸政治情勢不佳的陰影，卻能獲得原本得不到的資源。

The film committee will make up the talents. Xu Ruoxi, La Xie Ying, starred in the starring role.

The Taipei Film Commission has held the ""Taipei Film and Sound Talents Media Association"" since last year, providing direct access to the platform for creators and employers, and seeking cooperation. This year is the second. In the last session, I only wanted to test the water temperature. I didn't expect to promote nearly 250 sessions. There were also two works that successfully managed to shoot. One of them was ""The Lonely Taste"" starring Xu Ruoxuan and Xie Yingxi. This year, the Film Commission is more optimistic that it can succeed in matching and launching 3 to 5 works, introducing more foreign talents and funds into Taiwan.
From March, I can see that Xu Ruoxuan has repeatedly published photos of the film ""Orphan"" in his personal IG. The film released the cast in May. In addition to Xu Ruoxuan, there are also ""female women"" Xie Yingwei, Sun Kefang, Ding Ning, and the company. Chen Shufang, the ""Auntie of the Whole People"", starred in the women of the same color, and Xu Ruoxuan also worked as a supervisor with the editing master Liao Qingsong.

Rich in type, greatly increased in feasibility
Although this is only one of Xu’s personal dozens of film works, it is the Taipei Film Commission’s “Taipei Film and Sound Talents Matching Conference”. The first film was successfully completed by the film co-creator and the employer. works. This year's main event is composed of script creation and animation special effects talents. Rao Zijuan, director of the Film Commission, revealed that there were more than 300 talks this year, which was 25% more than last year, and the type of scripts has expanded.


Rao Zijuan, director of the Taipei Film Commission, is optimistic that three to five successful matches will be able to start shooting next year.

Rao Zijuan said that the scriptwriters of the CCC last year were still slightly green, but this year's professionalism and enforceability increased, and even attracted some veteran veterans. Therefore, she is optimistic that she should be able to see 3 to 5 next year. The film and television works successfully produced by the Ministry.


Li Zhigang, president of Mina Film and Television in Hong Kong, believes that Taiwan's script is of a high standard, but needs to be more familiar with film and television regulations, financial management, and marketing talents.

According to observations, the film production companies and employers' representatives who came to the media conference this year are all eager for ""IP"". Li Zhigang, president of Mina Film and Television from Hong Kong, has been looking for a script that can cooperate in the past two years. Li Zhigang believes that Taiwan's script is of a high standard. ""It's like a good fruit, but with nutrients, the fruit can grow well."" Li Zhigang also made a suggestion: ""Taiwan needs to be more familiar with regulations, financial management, marketing. In addition to scripts and production, we will help the film and television industry to be more healthy.""
Limited subject matter
In addition, the winners of the 11th ""Taipei Movies"" screenplay selection event also sought suitable producers and investors in the video media conference. The gold script winner Yang Cilu's ""Greed Algorithm"" was based on 1999 Shin Kong. Preserving the self-stealing of gold and cash, which is worth a total of 300 million yuan, has been the unsuccessful case of unsettled people, and explores the prisoner's mentality of committing crimes. The story of real people's actual adaptation is quite eye-catching. Yang Cilu said that more than 10 production companies have talked to her, hoping that the script will be successful.

In recent years, mainland China has been unable to pass trials because of too many subjects. Once foreign-invested films can't be released, they will face huge losses at any time, but this has also become Taiwan's bullishness, because many people who are afraid of being affected are transferred to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea this year. The company is actively seeking cooperation with Taiwan. Rao Zijuan believes that this is a turning point for Taiwan. Although Taiwan is optimistic about the shadow of cross-strait political situation, it can obtain resources that it could not get.
