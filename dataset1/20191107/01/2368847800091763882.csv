習近平「區塊鏈」話音未落 任正非：不值一提

07 Nov 2019, 01:49

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】習近平近日熱捧「區塊鏈」，甚至將其形容為中共「未來發展的核心」。然而，習近平語音未落，華為總裁任正非就嘲諷說，區塊鏈不值一提。
11月6日，任正非在深圳總部針對信息安全問題發表言論。據鳳凰財經報導，任正非表示，現在說區塊鏈多麼偉大，但是在量子計算機面前，就不值一提了。
任正非還說，信息安全是相對的，量子計算機出現後，幾百萬年破譯不了的信息都能破譯。
外界認為，任正非此言無疑是對習近平熱捧的區塊鏈，澆下一瓢冷水。
在中國經濟急速衰退的大背景下，習近平在四中全會召開前大力提倡區塊鏈，將其提高到國家戰略的高度，引發輿論高度關注。中國股市中與區塊鏈相關的科技股也一度暴漲，不過隨即就開始暴跌。
曾服務於摩托羅拉、微軟和雅虎的網際網路研發專家程墨，目前在美國媒體服務公司Hulu擔任架構師。他近日發表了《火爆的區塊鏈炒作只不過是又一個「水變油」騙局》一文，對區塊鏈火爆現象進行深度分析。
他在文章中介紹，區塊鏈是分布式數據存儲、點對點傳輸、共識機制、加密演算法等計算機技術的新型應用模式。區塊鏈並不是一個新技術，用區塊鏈技術發明的比特幣，差不多就有了10年。區塊鏈的一個特點就是它的信息安全性，不可刪改。
同時他也指出，中共大力提倡區塊鏈，試圖以此提振經濟，但這項技術並不是所謂的萬能「妙藥」，除了用於虛擬貨幣上，用於其他領域沒有任何技術優勢。
中國經濟觀察人士秦鵬對大紀元表示，習近平把區塊鏈當成新法寳推出有三個目的：
第一個目的是監控，中共要去搶佔標準基礎設施、頂層設計，以達到監控和管理社會。
第二個目的是中共的金融野心，推出區塊鏈的同時，重點也提了國家數字貨幣。中共試圖通過一帶一路推廣國家數字貨幣，希望以此跟美國爭奪金融霸權。
第三個目的是建設中共特色的「全球命運共同體」。從區塊鏈的技術延伸角度上講，它未來可能改變金融、物流、製造、軍事等各領域。中共試圖在這方面搶佔先機，彰顯其全球爭霸的野心。

Xi Jinping's ""blockchain"" voice has not fallen. Ren Zhengfei: not worth mentioning

07 Nov 2019, 01:49

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Xi Jinping has recently embraced the ""blockchain"" and even described it as the ""core of future development"" of the CCP. However, Xi Jinping’s voice has not fallen, and Huawei’s president Ren Zhengfei ridiculed that the blockchain is not worth mentioning.
On November 6, Ren Zhengfei made a speech on the information security issue at the Shenzhen headquarters. According to Phoenix Finance, Ren Zhengfei said that now how great the blockchain is, but in the face of quantum computers, it is not worth mentioning.
Ren Zhengfei also said that information security is relative. After the emergence of quantum computers, information that could not be deciphered for millions of years can be deciphered.
The outside world believes that Ren Zhengfei’s remarks are undoubtedly the blockchain that Xi Jinping is eager to take, pouring a cold water.
In the context of China's rapid economic recession, Xi Jinping vigorously promoted the blockchain before the Fourth Plenary Session, raising it to the height of the national strategy, causing public concern. The technology stocks related to the blockchain in China's stock market also skyrocketed, but then they began to plunge.
Cheng Mo, an Internet research and development expert who has worked for Motorola, Microsoft and Yahoo, is currently an architect at Hulu, a US media services company. He recently published ""The hot blockchain speculation is just another ""water-to-oil"" scam"", which provides an in-depth analysis of the blockchain hot phenomenon.
He introduced in the article that the blockchain is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption algorithm. Blockchain is not a new technology, and bitcoin invented with blockchain technology has been around for 10 years. One of the characteristics of the blockchain is its information security, which cannot be deleted.
At the same time, he also pointed out that the CCP strongly advocates the blockchain in an attempt to boost the economy, but this technology is not a so-called omnipotent ""magic drug"". Apart from being used in virtual currency, there is no technical advantage in other fields.
Chinese economic observer Qin Peng told the Epoch Times that Xi Jinping's introduction of the blockchain as a new magic weapon has three purposes:
The first purpose is to monitor, the CCP is going to seize the standard infrastructure and top-level design to achieve monitoring and management of the society.
The second purpose is the CCP's financial ambitions. At the same time as the introduction of the blockchain, the focus is also on the national digital currency. The CCP is trying to promote the national digital currency through the Belt and Road, hoping to compete with the United States for financial hegemony.
The third purpose is to build a ""global destiny community"" with the characteristics of the CCP. From the perspective of the technical extension of the blockchain, it may change the fields of finance, logistics, manufacturing, and military in the future. The CCP is trying to seize the opportunity in this respect and demonstrate its ambitions for global hegemony.
