So when such a system suffers a crippling days-long outage and the operators are tight-lipped about why, look no further than Bert Hubert (who you may know from the PowerDNS project) to scramble together a <a href="https://github.com/ahupowerdns/galmon">bunch of code</a> and a <a href="https://galmon.eu/">worldwide network of volunteers</a>, to analyze exactly what happened. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/galileo-accident/">This is the story of how and why the Galileo GNSS network was down for a whole week.</a></i></p>
