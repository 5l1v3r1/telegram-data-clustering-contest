      <p>Voter registration clinics have been organised by loyalists to coincide with the gatherings to try to maximise votes in key constituencies.</p>
      <p>Mr Bryson said they were "organic events, aimed at encouraging friends and family to vote", claiming that nationalists were running an "aggressive Irish nationalist" campaign in an attempt to "unseat unionist MPs".</p>

      <p>"We will not sit idly by and allow Boris Johnson's betrayal act to drive Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom and into an economic united Ireland," he said.</p>
      <p>Loyalists have reacted angrily to plans by the prime minister to create a 'sea border' between Britain and Northern Ireland under his Brexit deal with EU leaders.</p>
      <p>A meeting organised in east Belfast last month was attended by a number of senior paramilitary figures from once rival factions.</p>
