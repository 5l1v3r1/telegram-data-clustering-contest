      <h1>Left-handed women's quirk over sense of smell</h1>

        <b>Scientists say they have discovered a biological anomaly that could change how we understand our sense of smell.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The study <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30854-2">in the journal Neuron</a> shows some people can smell normally, despite missing the part of the brain that is considered to be crucial for smell - the olfactory bulbs.</p>
      <p>Lacking bulbs should cause anosmia (being unable to smell).</p>
      <p>Curiously, the phenomenon mostly affects left-handed women, and has never been detected in men.</p>
      <h3>How does smell work?</h3>
      <p>So how do we smell a fresh mug of coffee, a garden flower or even a newborn's soiled nappy?</p>
      <p>Current science says odours enter the nose where they excite nerve endings.</p>
      <p>This creates an electrical signal that travels up to a specialised part of the brain called the olfactory bulbs.</p>
      <p>They process the signals coming from the nose to work out what we are sniffing.</p>
      <p>Except researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have found people who have a normal sense of smell even though they are bulb-less.</p>

      <h3>How common is it?</h3>
      <p>The scientists stumbled across the first example when doing brain scans of people with a healthy sense of smell as part of a completely unrelated study.</p>
      <p>Researcher Prof Noam Sobel told BBC News: "We could not find any sign of olfactory bulb in her brain, it's an anomaly - this does not make sense, right?"</p>
      <p>The woman was left-handed and the researchers wanted to compare her brain to other left-handed women, to see what was going on.</p>
      <p>They only had to scan another nine brains before they found another woman with no bulbs, but a cracking sense of smell.</p>
      <p>"It was overwhelmingly shocking, this started ringing all the bells," Prof Sobel said.</p>
      <p>The team then turned to a public library of 1,113 brain scans - the <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/">Human Connectome Project</a> - and found yet more examples.</p>
      <p>The phenomenon has never been detected in men, but is present in more than 4% of left-handed women.</p>
      <p>Prof Sobel said he had "absolutely no clue" why gender and left-handedness seem to be involved.</p>
      <h3>So what is going on?</h3>
      <p>There are a number of ideas, but only more research will tell which is correct.</p>
      <p>One possibility is the women do have olfactory bulbs, but they are so small they cannot be detected on brain scans.</p>
      <p>However, this does not explain how they retain such a good sense of smell with such compromised bulbs.</p>
      <p>Another explanation is the brain's ability to adapt, known as plasticity.</p>
      <p>If a child is born without olfactory bulbs, then maybe another part of the brain takes on the bulb's aroma-discerning responsibilities.</p>
      <p>But the researchers have raised a more controversial explanation which challenges current understanding of smell.</p>
      <p>They argue the bulbs may not be involved in recognising smells and instead have a different role, potentially for locating a smell rather than identifying it.</p>
      <p>"It's a dramatic alternative," said Prof Sobel.</p>
      <p>He added: "My hunch is the olfactory bulbs may be more important for the 'where'."</p>
      <h3>What do experts think?</h3>
      <p>"The fact that their olfactory ability is virtually identical to that of normal subjects is very surprising," Prof Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester told the BBC.</p>
      <p>Prof Cobb, author of the forthcoming book <i>Smell: A Very Short Introduction</i> says the living brain is very flexible, and may be compensating for a lack of olfactory bulbs.</p>
      <p>"For example, there is a man in Marseille whose cortex - the region of the brain generally thought to be involved in higher intellectual functions - is compressed into a tiny sliver of cells, yet he is of average intelligence and holds down a job as a civil servant.</p>
      <p>"In China, a young woman has no cerebellum - the structure at the base of the brain involved in co-ordination - and although she does have slurred speech and poor coordination, these symptoms are nowhere near as serious as animal studies would suggest they should be."</p>
