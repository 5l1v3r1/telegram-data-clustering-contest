      <p>INSPIRED by a true story, The Aeronauts takes flight with a heavy cargo of dramatic licence to chart a high-altitude expedition, which pushes two emotionally driven souls to the upper limits of human endurance.</p>
      <p>Director Tom Harper's visually stunning odyssey is loosely tethered to Richard Holmes's 2013 book Falling Upwards: How We Took To The Air, which pays tribute to brave pioneers of the ballooning community.</p>
      <p>Scriptwriter Jack Thorne focuses on one notable entry – the record-breaking 1862 ascent of James Glaisher and Henry Coxwell – and replaces one of the men with a fictional female adventurer, whose daredevil actions are thrillingly realised by a stunt woman on a balloon in mid-flight.</p>
      <p>Harper repeatedly smacks our gobs with vertiginous thrills and spills including a knuckle-whitening encounter with a raging storm that spins the balloon wildly out of control.</p>
      <p>On a technical level, the film soars and George Steel's breath-taking cinematography is particularly captivating on a giant IMAX screen.</p>
      <p>However, characters are emotionally malnourished despite the best efforts of Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne to recapture their Oscar-winning on-screen chemistry from The Theory Of Everything.</p>
      <p>James Glaisher (Redmayne) is a meteorologist in Victorian London, who believes the secret to predicting weather patterns lies 30,000 feet above the earth.</p>
      <p>While colleagues in the scientific community pour scorn on his ideas, James is compelled to prove his theory by attempting a record-breaking hot air balloon flight captained by Amelia Wren (Jones).</p>
      <p>She is the wife of a famous pilot, Pierre (Vincent Perez), who lost his life two years earlier during an ill-fated ascent.</p>
      <p>Haunted by Pierre's self-sacrifice, Amelia accompanies James in a wicker basket bearing a motto from Ovid – Caelum certe patet, ibimus illi – which translates as: "surely the sky lies open, let us go that way".</p>
      <p>Far below, James's elderly parents (Sir Tom Courtenay and Anne Reid) and his good friend John Trew (Himesh Patel) await news of the expedition.</p>
      <p>As the balloon passes 12,000 feet, James and Amelia are dazzled by swarms of butterflies fluttering around the basket.</p>
      <p>Soon, reduced oxygen levels and the plummeting temperature threaten theirs wellbeing.</p>
      <p>As the altimeter records 30,000 feet, Amelia prepares to clamber atop the bulging silk canopy to forcibly remove ice from a release valve, which should allow the balloon to descend safety back to terra firma.</p>
      <p>The Aeronauts gender-flips historical fact to provide Harper's picture with a gutsy heroine a la Sandra Bullock in Gravity, who refuses to surrender her fate to the laws of physics.</p>
      <p>Immersive sound design heightens tension at key moments as Jones and Redmayne chew delicately on the script's meagre scraps.</p>
      <p>They convince us to care about their airborne trailblazers while a dizzying whirl of digital effects rages around them.</p>
