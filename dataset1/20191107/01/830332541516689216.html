      <p>(CNN) - Just one day after a man reported his gun missing, it turned up -- in his grandson's backpack.</p>
      <p>A 6-year-old child in first grade at Kids Care Elementary in Columbus, Ohio brought a loaded, semiautomatic gun to school in his backpack Wednesday, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColumbusPolice/posts/10156783548406762">police say</a>.</p>
      <p>The school discovered the gun when he told another student about the weapon. That student reported it to a teacher. The school, after collecting the firearm, contacted police.</p>
      <p>Det. Dave Bucy, who works with the department's gun crimes unit, said the reason why the gun was brought to school was unknown.</p>
      <p>"I think it was curiosity to one extent," he said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColumbusPolice/videos/2429284317329295/">at a news conference</a>. "I think it was, 'Look what I have in my bag' to another extent."</p>
      <p>The child, due to his age and competency, will not be charged in the case, Bucy said. The incident remains under investigation.</p>
      <h3>The day could have gone much worse, police say</h3>
      <p>Still, the episode could have easily had another outcome, Bucy said.</p>
      <p>"I think it's very obvious that this could have been the worst day that that school could have ever experienced," he said.</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that more schoolage children die from guns than <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/health/gun-deaths-school-age-children-trnd/index.html">on-duty police in the US</a>.</p>
      <p>Many of these are accidental. Another study, based on data from 2012 to 2014, found that out of the thousands of children receiving medical treatment for gun-related injuries, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/19/health/child-gun-violence-study/index.html">21% are unintentional</a>.</p>
      <p>Bucy warned firearm owners about keeping weapons secured in their homes or on their persons.</p>
      <p>"Keeping firearms away from juveniles is a must and not a request," he said.</p>
