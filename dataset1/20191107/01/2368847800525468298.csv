馬克龍訪華談香港 勸習近平「需要對話」

07 Nov 2019, 01:31

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】儘管北京當局提前要求法國不要提香港議題，但法國總統馬克龍在為期3天的訪華期間，仍然多次清楚地告訴習近平，歷經數個月民主抗爭的香港議題，需要對話解決，「我表達了我們和其他歐洲國家的關切。」
法國總統馬克龍於11月4日至6日訪問中國，出席第二屆中國國際進口博覽會。馬克龍出發前，法國總統府就已經對中方宣布，雙方會談將不會有禁忌話題，包括香港或新疆的人權問題。中共外交部也預先警告稱，香港新疆都是中共的內部事務，列入外交會談不合適。
然而，結束為期3天中國行的馬克龍，仍在11月6日召開的記者會表示，他曾告訴習近平，歷經數個月民主抗爭的香港議題需要對話。
馬克龍說：「我曾多次清楚地向習近平主席提了這件事情……我表達了我們和其他歐洲國家的關切……我們一再呼籲各方對話，要展現克制、緩和。」
他還透露，自己告訴習近平：「問題核心在於強調透過對話緩解局勢的必要性。」
今次是馬克龍第二次訪華，他5日還當着習近平的面，指責中共不夠開放，以及外界「對中共的改革承諾持懷疑態度」。
馬克龍當着習近平的面表示，不少外國政府和商業團體對中共的改革承諾均持懷疑態度，他並指外國政府和商業團體曾長期警告，如果中共的開放跟其貿易夥伴長期不對稱，中共將招致貿易夥伴的報復。
據悉，馬克龍在香港民眾抗爭時期到訪中國，法國內部有很多質疑聲音。路透社6日說，在馬克龍到訪期間，中法兩國簽署了40多項總值150億美元的貿易合約，涉及航空、能源以及農業等領域，並有20家法國公司獲准向中共出口家禽、牛肉和豬肉。
馬克龍4日在上海一酒店內，與法國和德國企業高層面前講話時，還曾呼籲歐洲人要團結起來，共同面對中共，而不是和中共單打獨鬥。
