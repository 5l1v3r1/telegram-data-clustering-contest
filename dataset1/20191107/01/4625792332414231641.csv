Whistleblower's attorney warned Trump a ‘coup is coming’ in 2017 tweets
07 Nov 2019, 01:31 by Madison Dibble
The Ukraine whistleblower’s attorney Mark Zaid has been warning President Trump of a pending coup since 2017.
Zaid has been a critic of the president long before he was hired to represent the whistleblower that triggered the House impeachment proceeding.
In 2017, Zaid tweeted that Trump was facing a “rebellion” that would eventually lead to impeachment.






Zaid’s tweets came as Trump announced that Trump had fired Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce executive policies.
Zaid became a pivotal member of Trump’s impeachment by representing the whistleblower.
Despite calls from Trump and others for the whistleblower to be identified and provide an impeachment testimony, Zaid has maintained that the whistleblower will remain anonymous.
He called any efforts to identify the whistleblower the “pinnacle of irresponsibility.”
