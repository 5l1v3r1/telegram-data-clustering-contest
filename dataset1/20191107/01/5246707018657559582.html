      <p>We've seen some fatal cuties in certain other games in the past, but this one is perhaps the <i>cutest</i> of them all.</p>
      <p>Following the release of the DLC fighter Terry Bogard in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b>, the Nintendo Versus Twitter account has uploaded a few screenshots to showcase what exactly the pink puffball Kirby looks like as the iconic SNK character from the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/fatal_fury">Fatal Fury</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/king_of_fighters_95">King of Fighters</a></b> series.</p>

      <p>Kirby's copy ability gives him Terry's cap, his long blonde ponytail, and even his leather gloves. It also allows him to perform the fighter's neutral special attack, Power Wave.</p>
      <p>As previously noted, Kirby isn't the first character to be turned into a fatal cutie. There was a time when Terry himself was <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/fatal_furyrs_terry_bogard_has_been_transformed_into_a_lfatal_cutier_in_snk_heroines">transformed</a> into one in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snk_heroines_tag_team_frenzy">SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy</a></b>, as a result of a prank.</p>
