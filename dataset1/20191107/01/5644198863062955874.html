      <p>WASHINGTON: The new leader of the Islamic State group is "a nobody" with little apparent reputation but the United States hopes he will be killed soon, a US official said on Wednesday (Nov 6).</p>
      <p>The group last week announced Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi as its new leader after a US commando raid killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chief of the ultra-violent movement.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that monitoring of Islamic State social media indicates that even followers did not know much about Hashimi.</p>
      <p>"That has become a major issue in, if you will, the ISIS social media world. This guy appears to be a nobody," the official told reporters.</p>
      <p>"What little we know about him, we're not impressed. And if he's in Iraq or Syria, we don't think he's too long for the world anyway," he said.</p>
      <p>The official declined to offer further details, including whether, like Baghdadi, Hashimi had been detained at some point by US forces.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump last week tweeted of the group's new leader that "we know exactly who he is," but few details have emerged about Hashimi.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi, who led the Islamic State group since 2014, had become the world's most wanted person for the militants' grisly attacks both in the region and abroad.</p>
      <p>The Islamic State group confirmed that the 48-year-old Iraqi died in the raid in Syria's northwestern Idlib province.</p>
