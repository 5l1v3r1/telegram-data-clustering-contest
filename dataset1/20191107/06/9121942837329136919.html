      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is reporting substantial losses for the third quarter driven by catastrophic wildfires. The company anticipates those costs could escalate to as much as $6.3 billion.</p>
      <p>The state’s largest utility on Thursday swung to a loss of $1.62 billion, after a profit of $564 million in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>That’s a per-share loss of $3.06, or $1.11 when one-time costs are removed. Revenue was $4.43 billion.</p>
      <p>The bankrupt company is facing criticism for blackouts intended to limit wildfires, but that have left millions without power.</p>
      <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom called PG&amp;E CEO Bill Johnson into a closed-door meeting Tuesday.</p>
