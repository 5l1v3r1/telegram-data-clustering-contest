07 Nov 2019, 06:05

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】「伊斯蘭國」（IS）首腦巴格達迪（Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi）被美軍特種部隊獵殺後，伊斯蘭國10月31日宣布，阿比．易卜拉欣．哈希米．古拉希（Abi Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi）為新任領導人。對此，一名美國高層官員日前表示，伊斯蘭國新領袖只不過是無名小輩，但也活不久了。
《法新社》報導引述一名美國高層官員表示，監控伊斯蘭國社交媒體的資料顯示，即使是追隨者也對古拉希所知甚少，誰都不知道他的出身，好像他是個無名之輩（nobody）。該名官員說，「我們對他雖然有一點了解，但是不多，以至於沒有留下印象。」
該名美國官員指出，「如果他在伊拉克或者敘利亞，我們不認為他還能在這個世界上活多久了。」這名官員拒絕提供進一步的細節，包括像巴格達迪一樣，古拉希是否曾經被美軍拘留等細節。
據報，10月27日，美國川普（特朗普）總統公布巴格達迪在26日晚的一個突擊行動中死亡的消息。28日，美國務院的一位高級官員向「福克斯新聞」證實，巴格達迪的頭號接班人穆哈吉爾在美軍對敘利亞阿勒頗省（Aleppo）發動的另一次突擊中死亡。
美國總統川普29日也發推說：「剛剛證實，阿布•巴克爾•巴格達迪的頭號接班人已經被美軍擊斃。此人原本最有可能接班，而現在他也死了。」
10月31日伊斯蘭國證實巴格達迪的死訊，並宣布阿比．易卜拉欣．哈希米．古拉希（Abi Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi）為新任領導人。
