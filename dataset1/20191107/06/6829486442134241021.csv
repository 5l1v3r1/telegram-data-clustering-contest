Gaze In Horror At This Creepy DeepFake Video Of Diplo And Niall Horan
07 Nov 2019, 06:04 by Jules LeFevre
If you’ve traipsed across the internet in recent months, there’s a high chance you’ve stumbled across the legitimately terrifying phenomenon of DeepFakes.
If you’re not familiar, they’re essentially computer-generated fake photographs and videos — which seems like a fairly innocent quirk of the internet age, until you consider the disastrous role they could play in the spread of disinformation around the world.

They’ve been cropping up more and more recently in pop culture: this blend of Tom Cruise and Bill Hader spread like wildfire back in August, and the morphing of Jennifer Lawrence and Steve Buscemi back in January was even more bizarre. Never one to miss out on a trend, Diplo has now entered the game.
His latest remix of Niall Horan’s ‘Nice To Meet Ya’ is accompanied by a DeepFake video combining both of their faces. It’s done very, very well — you can tell where the faces shift by the subtle change in their jawlines, and the shift in lighting. But if you weren’t familiar with the faces of both artists, there’s almost no chance you could tell it’s two different people.
Watch the clip below, and embrace the horrifying future of the internet.
