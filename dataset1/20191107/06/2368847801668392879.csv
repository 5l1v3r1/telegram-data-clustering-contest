多家港媒報導，香港中文大學11月7日早上舉行畢業禮，由開始到典禮期間都有畢業生以不同形式抗議。
有學生及畢業生發起於港鐵大學站集合，並遊行至校內烽火台，部分畢業生戴「V 煞」面具及頭盔，手持「中大人不割蓆」、「光復香港時代革命」標語橫幅，高喊口號，由大學港鐵站，遊行至百萬大道。
遊行學生沿途高呼：「光復香港 時代革命」、「香港人 反抗」、「五大訴求 缺一不可」，並唱出《願榮光歸香港》，其後再度高喊口號。
遊行隊伍到達「烽火台」時，一名講普通話的人士突然持刀衝前唱中共國歌，有人質問他為什麼拿着刀，他聲稱因為害怕，但現場並沒有人攻擊他，該男後來被保安帶走。
參與遊行的學生於烽火台前，為反送中運動衝突中受傷的學生及離世的市民默哀一分鐘。
然後，中大畢業生代表在場以中、英文宣讀聲明，批評反送中風波擾攘5個月，市民被捕、受傷，付上沉重代價，但政府和警隊至今仍未有人要為事件負上責任。
遊行結束，各位學生隨後進入典禮會場參與畢業禮。

香港科技大學學生周梓樂在警方清場中墜樓，仍處於重傷昏迷中。據立場新聞報導說，當日在香港科技大學畢業禮上，有畢業生戴口罩上台，有人拒絕向校長史維鞠躬，更有人在台上大喊「希望在於人民，改變始於抗爭」。
在畢業禮開始前，數十名身穿黑衣年輕人在場外抗議，部分人拿着單張，上面寫上科大生周梓樂受重傷的事。因為難得有中國家長來到現場，希望讓他們看到事實真相。
畢業典禮奏起中共國歌時，場外人士大唱《願榮光歸香港》，而在禮台前則有畢業生舉起標語。

反送中以年輕人為主

以年輕人為主的香港反送中運動已經持續5個月，雖然這場民主運動得到港人、全球各界的支持，但卻遭到港警血腥鎮壓。截至目前，超過3000被捕，其中三分之一是未成年人。
港府10月25日公開的數據顯示，至少有264名大學生被捕。其中理工大學共有58人被捕，5人已被起訴，其次是中文大學、香港大學及專業教育學院（IVE），分別有57人、44人及40人被捕，已被起訴的人數分別是14人、2人及10人。
10月10日晚，香港中文大學學生吳傲雪（Sonia）向校長哭訴，自己被捕期間遭遇警員性暴力，其他被捕人士也曾經遭受警員性侵及虐待等。吳同學哭訴後，短短幾天就得到逾1.8萬中大師生、校友實名聯署聲援，要求港府徹查施暴警員，要求校方加強保護學生。
