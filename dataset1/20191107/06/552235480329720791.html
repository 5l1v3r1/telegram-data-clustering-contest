      <p>A man was stopped by police near Overtown who then discovered a huge drugs haul in his car.</p>
      <p>Graeme Gallagher was caught on the Garrion Bridge after officers had observed him driving in an erratic manner for several miles.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, 27, admitted being concerned in the supply of the class A drug last December.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Guy, prosecuting, told Hamilton Sheriff Court that police officers noticed the vehicle on the East Kilbride Expressway shortly before 7pm.</p>
      <p>She explained: “The driver appeared very hesitant. He was on and off the brakes, driving well under the speed limit.</p>
      <p>“He travelled on to the M74, took the exit for Larkhall and headed for Garrion Bridge. At all times he was driving in a hesitant manner.</p>
      <p>“Eventually police stopped him.</p>
      <p>“Officers saw a polythene bag containing white powder next to the driver’s seat. He was detained and admitted he had some ‘gear’ in his pocket.</p>
      <p>“A small amount of cocaine was found inside his pocket.</p>
      <p>“There was in total 246.59 grams of cocaine with a purity level of 70 per cent.</p>
      <p>“The wholesale value of the drugs would be up to £12,000, but if sub divided and sold it would give a total value of £24,700.</p>
      <p>“Gallagher answered ‘No comment’ to every question the police put to him.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher’s lawyer said the dad of two works full time as a labourer for a bricklayer and “realises the seriousness” of his situation.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar deferred sentence until November 14 for a criminal justice social work report and a restriction of liberty assessment.</p>
      <p>Gallagher, of Brackenhill Drive, Hamilton, had his bail continued.</p>
