An Actually Useful Guide to Crystals

07 Nov 2019, 06:53

Like anybody, I’m a sucker for a gorgeous, good vibes–y crystal. But due to said prettiness, it can be easy to forget to ask the tough questions. Like, um, how do they work? Do they work? How much should I spend on one? Also, there are just So. Many. Crystals. How do I pick the best one for me?
So I asked one of our resident astrologers, Aliza Kelly, for some intel. “Crystals are sort of like little USB drives,” Kelly says. “They’re particularly receptive to us putting our intentions into them.” Basically, you can consider crystals a super ’gram-friendly combo of a vision board, a diary, and—I don’t know—a guardian angel? They’re not as $$ as they sound either. According to Kelly, “Most of the crystals linked to different practices of love, abundance, prosperity, health, or protection are actually really affordable and not hard to find.”
I want a crystal starter kit of my own, so I enlisted the help of Erica Feldmann, the founder and owner of HausWitch, a home and healing store in Salem, Massachusetts (aka Witch City). And she should know— Feldmann is always packing. “My shop girls and I keep them in our bras, our pockets, our purses, and our cars,” she says. “The bigger chunks are great—but you don’t need that!” Find what you do need below.


for your 24/7 Rose Quartz Crystal Clusteranthropologie.com $18.00 SHOP NOW Rose quartz is Feldmann’s go-to for “ultimate self-love.” Keep one in your bra, near a mirror, or even as a face roller.



for your wallet Handmade Green Moldavite Crystal Gold NecklaceTinisTinyThings etsy.com $18.99 SHOP NOW Moldavite is great for heart healing and releasing money blockages. PSA: This crystal can be pricey, so stick to small chunks.



for your bedroom Howlite Raw CrystalDivineSpiritualGifts etsy.com $2.40 SHOP NOW Howlite is ideal for keeping things chill. Set it on a nightstand, Feldmann suggests. You can’t have enough good bedroom vibes. 



for your yoga bag Amethyst Crystal Clusteranthropologie.com $18.00 SHOP NOW Amethyst can tap into your psyche and, as Feldmann puts it, “act as your third eye, helping with intuition.”



for your desk Raw Carnelian RingBhagatjewels etsy.com $21.00 SHOP NOW This red-orange stone is fiery and great for manifesting creativity. Perfect for any bouts of writer’s block.



for your purse Raw Black Tourmalineetsy.com $8.60 SHOP NOW “I’m susceptible to a lot of energy—good and bad,” Feldmann says. “Black tourmaline is an amazing protector.”



for the office Pyrite Nuggetsetsy.com $1.57 SHOP NOW For willpower—which is why Feldmann keeps pyrite at her desk “whenever I’m doing something new or business-related.”
