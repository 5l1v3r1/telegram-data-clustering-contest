      <h1>Wishaw, Newmains, Motherwell and Cleland library hours cut due to cuts</h1>
      <h2>It follows a consultation, which asked users to choose when the current hours of opening should be retained as part of a savings package.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>Wishaw Library will be closing two hours earlier on Mondays and Wednesdays from later this month.</p>
      <p>It follows a public consultation during the summer, which asked users to choose when the current hours of opening should be retained and which two evenings should be cut as part of a savings package.</p>
      <p>Cleland and Newarthill libraries will now be closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays as part of the same budgeting measures and their late openings will cease.</p>
      <p>Newmains library will be closing at 2pm on Fridays and Shotts and New Stevenston libraries will also shut at that time plus all-day on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>Motherwell library will also now close earlier at 5pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays instead of the current 7pm under the plans – which come into effect next Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>Library operators Culture NL had already decided to retain the later finishing time for its main town centre libraries on Thursdays, identified as the busiest evening of the week; Tuesday was then chosen as the other 7pm finish by 42 per cent of those voting on Wishaw’s hours.</p>
      <p>It means the town centre library, based in the Houldsworth Centre on Kenilworth Avenue, will now open from 9am to 5pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; 9am to 7pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays; and 10am to 5pm on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>The changed hours and days are the result of Culture NL being required to find efficiency savings of £400,000 for the current financial year, and the organisation noted of the consultation responses: “Most comments received stated an opposition to the proposals.”</p>
      <p>A total of 966 online and paper survey responses were submitted, including letters from two library industry bodies.</p>
