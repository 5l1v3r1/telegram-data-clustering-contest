大众银行第三季净赚13.6亿
07 Nov 2019, 06:18 by Surin Murugiah
（吉隆坡7日讯）大众银行（Public Bank Bhd）第三季净赚13亿6000万令吉，略低于上财年同期的13亿8000万令吉，归因于5月隔夜政策利率（OPR）调降的负面影响。
大众银行今日向大马交易所报备，截至9月杪第三季营业额为56亿1000万令吉，相比同期的56亿2000万令吉。
每股盈利从35.64仙，下滑至35.10仙。
综合2019财政年首9个月业绩，大众银行取得41亿1000万令吉的净利，一年前是41亿9000万令吉；营业额为167亿8000万令吉，同期报164亿1000万令吉。
大众银行创办人、名誉主席、董事兼顾问丹斯里郑鸿标在文告中指出，近期的营运环境局势对银行业构成进一步的挑战。
他表示，尽管宏观经济的不利因素依然存在，但5月降息也导致银行业的净息差下滑，进而影响截至9月杪首9个月的盈利。
“尽管如此，大众银行集团能够维持稳定的盈利表现，主要因为不断增长的贷款和存款业务，带来稳定的利息收入。”
他解释说，该集团的获利也得益于非利息收入在首9个月增长5.8%。
针对银行贷款和存款，郑鸿标称，该集团采取了一项策略，以优化融资状况，平衡存款增长和融资成本，同时确保充足的流动性缓冲。
他说，截至9月底，该集团的资金状况依然稳健，贷款总额和资金的比率及股本比率为79.8%。
他指出，大众信托（Public Mutual）仍是该集团的非利息收入的主要来源。
“首9个月，大众信托共管理152个单位信托基金，资产净值为842亿令吉，且维持在国内私人单位信托基金行业的市场领先地位，零售市占率为35.3%。”
在资产质量方面，他说，由于消费者面对来自宏观环境面临的挑战，银行业预期将面对更高的减值贷款。
“尽管贷款组合不断扩大，但大众银行集团仍能够保持强劲和稳定的资产质量，受益于集团谨慎放贷和积极收回的一贯做法。”
与此同时，针对海外业务，郑鸿标表示，海外业务依然是一个重要的收入来源。
“首9个月来自海外业务的盈利增长14.4%，主要来自印度支那，尤其是Campu Bank和Public Bank Vietnam Ltd。”
展望未来，郑鸿标称，在下行风险日益增加的情况下，大众银行集团将保持谨慎态度。
“惟这并不妨碍集团继续扩大业务。在不断增长的大马和区域经济中，银行仍有大量机会可以探索。”
“这包括对可负担房屋的持续需求，以及数字银行的发展所带来的新增长机会。”
休市时，大众银行平盘挂于19.80令吉，市值高达768亿7000万令吉。

07 Nov 2019, 06:18 by Surin Murugiah
KUALA LUMPUR (April 7): Public Bank Bhd posted a net profit of RM1.36 billion in the third quarter, slightly lower than the RM1.38 billion in the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to the overnight policy rate (OPR) adjustment. The negative impact of the decline.
Public Bank reported to the Bursa Malaysia today that its turnover in the third quarter of September was RM5.61 billion, compared to RM5.62 billion for the same period.
Earnings per share fell from 35.64 cents to 35.10 cents.
In the first nine months of the 2019 fiscal year, Public Bank achieved a net profit of RM4.11 billion, a year ago of RM4.19 billion; turnover of RM16.68 billion, and a record of RM16.41 billion.
Dansley Zheng Hongbiao, founder, honorary chairman, director and consultant of Public Bank, pointed out in the statement that the recent operating environment situation poses a further challenge to the banking industry.
He said that although the macroeconomic disadvantages still exist, the interest rate cut in May also led to a decline in the net interest margin of the banking industry, which in turn affected the profit for the first nine months of September.
“However, the Public Bank Group is able to maintain stable earnings performance, mainly due to the growing loan and deposit business, resulting in stable interest income.”
He explained that the group's profit also benefited from non-interest income growth of 5.8% in the first nine months.
In response to bank loans and deposits, Zheng Hongbiao said the group adopted a strategy to optimize financing conditions, balance deposit growth and financing costs, while ensuring adequate liquidity buffers.
He said that as of the end of September, the group's financial position remained stable, with the ratio of total loans to funds and equity ratio of 79.8%.
He pointed out that Public Mutual remains the main source of non-interest income for the group.
“In the first nine months, Public Trust managed a total of 152 unit trust funds with a net asset value of RM84.2 billion and maintained its market leading position in the domestic private sector trust fund industry with a retail market share of 35.3%.”
In terms of asset quality, he said that the bank is expected to face higher impaired loans as consumers face challenges from the macro environment.
“Although the loan portfolio continues to expand, the Public Bank Group is able to maintain strong and stable asset quality, benefiting from the Group’s consistent approach of cautious lending and active recovery.”
At the same time, for overseas business, Zheng Hongbiao said that overseas business is still an important source of income.
“The profit from overseas business increased by 14.4% in the first nine months, mainly from Indochina, especially Campu Bank and Public Bank Vietnam Ltd.”
Looking ahead, Zheng Hongbiao said that the Public Bank Group will remain cautious in the context of increasing downside risks.
“But this does not prevent the Group from continuing to expand its business. In the growing Malaysian and regional economies, banks still have plenty of opportunities to explore.”
“This includes continued demand for affordable housing and new growth opportunities brought about by the development of digital banking.”
At the time of the market, the public bank was hovering at RM19.80 with a market capitalization of RM76.87 billion.
