07 Nov 2019, 06:58 by BS Web Team
In an effort to end to the impasse over government formation in Maharashtra, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitin Gadkari on Thursday cancelled all his appointments and flew to Nagpur. He is expected to meet with Mohan Bhagwat, the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and discuss the political scenario with both the BJP and Shiv Sena unwilling to let go of the Chief Minister's post as the prospects of President's Rule loom ahead by this weekend. The tenure of the present assembly ends in two days.
There continues to be suspense over the shape of the next government in Maharashtra even though people of the state gave a clear mandate to the ruling coalition in the assembly election. Two alliances were in the contest for power in Maharashtra, the BJP-Shiv Sena's NDA and the NCP-Congress representing the UPA. Now, post-election, Shiv Sena, which won 56 seats, has staked claim to the Chief Minister’s Office, though on a rotational basis. The BJP, which emerged as the single-largest party with 105 seats, is unwilling to come to terms with Shiv Sena's demands.

October 30: Shiv Sena softens stand on its demand

The Shiv Sena softened its stand on its demand for rotational chief ministers and “50:50 power-sharing” in its negotiations with BJP over government formation in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said it was necessary for the party to stay in the BJP-led alliance in the larger interest of Maharashtra, but without compromising on “respect”. To a question on whether the Shiv Sena was adamant on implementing the equal power-sharing formula, Raut blamed the media for raking it up. “You (the media) are saying this. We only want things to be done according to what has been decided earlier.”
