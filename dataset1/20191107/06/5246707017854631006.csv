Capcom Didn't Like The Idea Of A Street Fighter Character In Mortal Kombat, ""Wasn't A Good Fit""
Ed Boon got rejected

Capcom has a long history of teaming up with Marvel, and has even allowed some of its characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate most recently, but would it be open to the likes of Ryu and Ken one day appearing in the brutal, violent and bloody Mortal Kombat series?
Apparently not, according to Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono. During an on-stage interview with Eurogamer at EGX last month, Ono was asked if he was the one who denied Ed Boon's request to add a Street Fighter character to Mortal Kombat.
While it's true the proposal was made, he wasn't the one who personally knocked Boon back:
It's true that a proposal for a Street Fighter character in Mortal Kombat was rejected by Capcom. But it wasn't me personally! There were many people at the company that felt that it wasn't a good fit for our characters. I actually met Ed at the Brazil game show and spoke to him personally about it. So it's true - but I didn't make the decision!
Eurogamer followed this up by asking if it was a case of the two worlds not mixing. Ono confirmed it was indeed a ""major concern"" for Capcom at the time.
Would Capcom be open to any crossovers in its own game, though? Although nothing was specifically mentioned about a Mortal Kombat character coming to the Street Fighter series in the future, Ono did note how Capcom liked the idea of guest fighters:
We don't necessarily rule anything out. We've had our share of crossovers over the years - Marvel vs. Capcom, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. From Ed Boon's side they had Injustice that had various universes colliding. It didn't work out this time, but Capcom is interested in doing that kind of thing. If we can get something we feel good about, we could move quite quickly to make that happen.

Do you think Capcom made the right call? How would you feel about a character like Ryu appearing in Mortal Kombat? Would it work better the other way round? Leave a comment below.
