While the first is currently in the production stage and the actors are shooting for the film in Mumbai they seemed to have developed a good camaraderie.</p>
      <p>The 'Coolie No. 1' co-stars were recently spotted at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayushmann-Khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a>'s 'Bala' screening last night and they even posed for the shutterbugs before leaving. But what grabbed our attention was their funny banter while posing as Varun struck Sara's popular pose whenever she is spotted in the city and looking at that the young starlet gave a stunned look and after flashing her beautiful smile she said, "Don't do that."</p>
