      </p>
      <p>Jacinda Ardern’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/new-zealand-introduces-bill-for-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050">landmark climate legislation</a> has passed in New Zealand parliament, with historic cross-party support, committing the nation to reduce its carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and meet its commitments under the Paris climate accords.</p>
      <p>The climate change response (zero carbon) amendment bill passed on Thursday afternoon with the centre-right opposition National party throwing their support behind it late in the day, despite none of their proposed amendments being accepted. The bill passed 119 votes to one.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change">Climate change</a> minister James Shaw said the bill, which commits New Zealand to keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees, provided a framework for the island country of nearly 5 million to adapt too, and prepare for the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>“We’ve led the world before in nuclear disarmament and in votes for women, now we are leading again.” Shaw said.</p>
      <p>“Climate change is the defining long-term issue of our generation that successive governments have failed to address. Today we take a significant step forward in our plan to reduce New Zealand’s emissions.”</p>
      <p>Prime minister <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/11/historic-moment-mps-erupt-in-applause-as-zero-carbon-bill-passes-final-reading.html">Jacinda Ardern told MPs</a> New Zealand was on the “right side of history”. She said: “I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.</p>
      <p>“Undeniably, our sea levels are rising, and undeniably, we are experiencing extreme weather events – increasingly so.</p>
      <p>“Undeniably, the science tells us the impact there will be on flora and fauna, and yes also the spread of diseases in areas where we haven’t previously seen them.”</p>
      <p>The bill will enshrine a new 2050 greenhouse gas reduction target into law and require that future governments have plans to meet the target. It will also establish a climate change commission and ensure future government’s plan and budget for adaption and mitigation.</p>
      <p>The reduction target will have two seperate plans. One for biogenic methane, or that which is produced by living organisms, and another for all other greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>The legislation has been applauded by environment groups around the globe, who said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> was leading the world in its pragmatic and levelled approach to climate change.</p>
      <p>Forest &amp; Bird chief executive Kevin Hague said the bill was only a first step. “Now we need to see a path to carbon neutrality that has protecting and restoring nature at its heart.”</p>
      <p>“The bill is only a first step on climate change. We need concrete, urgent, climate action to save our most vulnerable native species and restore native ecosystems.”</p>
