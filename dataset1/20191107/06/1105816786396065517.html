      <h1>Texas executes ex-leader of white supremacist gang for murder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:28:51+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>Texas on Wednesday executed a former leader of a white supremacist gang for the 2002 murder of a woman near El Paso.</p>
      <p>Justen Hall, 38, was pronounced dead at 6:32 pm (0032 GMT) at Texas’s Huntsville penitentiary.</p>
      <p>Hall was sentenced to death in 2005 for strangling to death a 29-year-old woman outside El Paso, then burying the body in the desert in nearby New Mexico.</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution, Hall killed the woman because she had threatened to reveal the existence of an illegal drug manufacturing laboratory run by Hall’s gang, the “Aryan Circle.”</p>
      <p>Hall’s attorneys lodged several appeals in an attempt to save his life, arguing that their client suffered mental problems and demanding additional DNA tests.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Hall himself asked them to abandon this effort, saying that he was “ready” to accept his fate.</p>
      <p>According to local media, in 2016 Hall described himself as a “rabid dog” who deserved to be shot.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, his lawyers recently tried to plead his case, saying that Hall’s refusal to defend himself proved a deterioration of his mental health.</p>
      <p>Hall is the 19th death row inmate executed this year in the United States and the eighth in the state of Texas.</p>
      <p>Texas on Wednesday resentenced another death row inmate, Bobby Moore, to life in prison after his case made it to the US Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>In 2017 the top US court ruled that Moore, sentenced to die for the murder of a cashier during a burglary in 1980 in Houston, could not be executed because of his serious mental deficiencies.</p>
      <p>The court also criticised the medical criteria Texas used to assess the mental health of the inmate.</p>
