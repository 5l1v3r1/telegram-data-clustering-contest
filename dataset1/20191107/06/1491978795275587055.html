        <i>International Barter Week initiative sees B&amp;B and hotel owners provide accommodation in return for DIY and tech knowhow</i>
      </p>
      <p>More than 600 B&amp;Bs, hotels and self-catering businesses across the world have signed up to take part in the second international Barter Week. The initiative runs for a week in November (18-24) and invites accommodation owners to offer free stays to guests in exchange for sharing skills or goods.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.barterweek.com/en/">Hosts register their “wishes”</a>, which range from carpentry and decorating skills to social media knowhow or website expertise and invite potential guests to make an offer.</p>
      <p>Properties range from an eco-retreat in Bulgaria that is looking for someone with <a href="https://www.barterweek.com/en/bb/wild-thyme/534">woodworking skills</a> to help build a reiki room in its garden to a Sri Lankan hotel-spa hoping to find an expert in search engine optimisation and a Torquay guesthouse in need of a painter and decorator.</p>
      <p>It’s not just skills that are required. A <a href="https://www.barterweek.com/en/bb/bb-cascina-moncrava/435">B&amp;B in Turin</a> is after children’s books in good condition; a <a href="https://www.barterweek.com/en/bb/casa-picassa-moscow-russia/1929">hostel in Moscow</a> wants board games, and a Ger house in Mongolia is hoping for a used computer.</p>
      <p>Among more obscure requests are “vintage globes”, wanted by a B&amp;B in Livorno, and musicians or acrobats to join a community setting up a vegetarian campsite south of Tarragona in Spain.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2018, the initiative is the sister project to Italian Barter Week which started 11 years ago when the website <a href="https://www.bed-and-breakfast.it/en/">bed-and-breakfast.it</a> discovered one of its members, in Sardinia, was bartering with guests.</p>
      <p>“When we found out there was this bizarre way of doing business, we asked all our properties to experiment for one week a year in low season,” said marketing manager Clara Corallo. The Italian edition of Barter Week, <a href="https://www.settimanadelbaratto.it/it">Settimana del Baratto</a>, which operates over the same period, has nearly 900 properties listed on its site.</p>
      <p>Corallo says the next stage is to launch a permanent bartering site for accommodation owners to use at any time of year, not just the fixed week. This is expected to launch in 2020.</p>
      <p>Barter Week is not the only initiative offering free stays in exchange for skills. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/06/amazing-places-to-stay-for-free-around-world-volunteering-holidays">Workaway lists 30,000 hosts worldwide</a> offering accommodation and food in exchange for a few hours’ work a day, and individual hostels and lodges around the world often offer free stays on an ad-hoc basis in return for skills.</p>
