      <p>Liverpool lead second-placed Man City by six points, and a win at Anfield on Sunday would be a massive boost for Pep Guardiola's side in their bid to defend the Premier League title.</p>
      <p>City are already without defenders Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko, while David Silva is also struggling with a thigh problem ahead of the weekend.</p>
