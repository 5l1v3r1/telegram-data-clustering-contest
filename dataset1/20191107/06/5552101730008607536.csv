【米蘭車展直擊】IONEX新成員　KYMCO i-ONE DX續航動力再提升
07 Nov 2019, 06:45 by 鄭閎, 鄭閎
國內二輪龍頭品牌KYMCO在今年的EICMA發表了IONEX車能網家族新成員i-ONE DX，這台以今年五月才曝光的i-ONE X為基礎的新車，是一款同樣具有白牌動力輸出的車款，但在部份的細節上面做出了更近一步的更動，此車推測將會在明年正式的量產。
i-ONE DX取消了輪殼馬達的設計，改採用動力更為直接的邊掛馬達設計，與i-ONE X相比極速提升到了時速74公里，最大續航力也從60公里提升到了90公里，同時透過了「擴充式電池插槽」，將電池位置改在置物箱中，最多可裝上兩顆電池，增加最大續航可能。


i-ONE DX在外觀上與i-ONE X沒有差別，車頭燈都載用LED燈組。



數位儀表導入了最新的Noodoe車聯網系統。

從外觀看過去，i-ONE DX的外型其實與i-ONE X幾乎沒有差別，但與先前所曝光的i-ONE X相比，這次i-ONE DX的儀表板導入了Noodoe車聯網系統，同時全數位儀表可輕易的辨別車輛的即時資訊，看起來極具科技感。


i-ONE DX搭載12吋的輪圈，同時邊掛馬達的輸出將更為直接。



i-ONE DX推測將在明年正式的量產。

在電動二輪進入戰國時代的狀況之下，雖然KYMCO被不少人詬病步調太慢，但其實從IONEX車能網發表至今不難看出他們一直在自己的節奏裡面，不因人廢言也不因為被罵就揠苗助長，這次i-ONE DX的曝光，也代表著KYMCO也同步的在聆聽消費者的聲音，不僅增加了動力，同時續航也再次的提升，算是一款值得期待的全新產品。

Compared with the i-ONE X, the speed is up to 74 km per hour and the maximum endurance is increased from 60 km to 90 km. Through the ""Expanded Battery Slot"", the battery position can be changed to the compartment, and up to two batteries can be installed to increase the maximum battery life.


The i-ONE DX is no different in appearance from the i-ONE X, and the headlights are equipped with LEDs.



The digital meter introduces the latest Noodoe car networking system.

Viewed from the outside, the i-ONE DX looks almost the same as the i-ONE X, but compared to the previously exposed i-ONE X, the i-ONE DX dashboard was introduced to the Noodoe car networking system. At the same time, the full digital instrument can easily identify the real-time information of the vehicle, which looks very scientific.


The i-ONE DX is equipped with a 12-inch rim, and the output of the side-mounted motor will be more direct.



i-ONE DX is supposed to be officially mass-produced next year.

Under the condition that the electric two-wheeled enter the Warring States period, although KYMCO was too slow to be criticized by many people, it is not difficult to see that they have been in their own rhythm since the publication of IONEX.
