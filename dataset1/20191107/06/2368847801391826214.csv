周曉輝：蓬佩奧正在一步步揭開中共的畫皮

07 Nov 2019, 06:57

繼10月24日美國副總統彭斯發表對華政策重磅演講後，30日美國國務卿蓬佩奧在哈德遜研究所的演講中，再一次清晰地區分了中共與中國、中國人，即中共不等於中國，不等於中國人民。蓬佩奧說道：「美國一直非常珍視與中國人民之間的友誼，但是中共政府與中國人民並非一回事。」「中共正在尋求用各種方法來挑戰美國和全世界，我們所有人都要直面這些挑戰。」
這樣清晰的區分讓一直隱藏在中國背後並綁架14億中國人的中共浮出水面，這也表明，美國和世界意識到正是中共利用手中竊取的權力，幾十年來戕害中國人，壓制信仰，毀壞中華文化，幹盡滔天壞事，並利用市場和金錢收買西方政要和各界精英，將中共的價值體系和行為方式向全世界輸出，構成了對美國和全世界的挑戰。對於中共的惡行，被壓迫和殘害的中國人也是深惡痛絕的。
對於這樣的中共，蓬佩奧毫不客氣地指出：「今天，我們終於認識到中國共產黨真正敵視美國和我們的價值觀的程度，以及它的更惡劣言行和對我們的影響。」「在今後幾個月中，我將發表一系列講話。我將更加具體地談到其中每一個問題。」
蓬佩奧的這番話可是讓中共膽顫心驚，這是因為他不僅明確點出了中共對美國和其價值觀的強烈敵視和影響，暗示雙方的真正問題根子是在價值觀上的差異，而且他還將抽絲剝繭，在未來的演講中，將中共的惡劣言行一一道出。借用清初小說家蒲松齡老人的說法，那就是將中共的畫皮一層層撥開。
蒲老先生當年寫的《聊齋誌異》中有篇叫《畫皮》的故事，講的是一個王姓書生一日清晨偶遇一名無家可歸的美麗女子，王生因為同情其遭遇，遂將其帶回家中藏進書房。不料，這是個專門吃人心的面目猙獰的鬼所變，在美麗的人皮後面是「翠色的面皮，長而尖利、像鋸子一樣的牙齒」。當道士識破其真面目後，因可憐其境況不忍傷其性命，故只是用拂塵希望將其嚇走；但披著人皮的鬼卻惱羞成怒，將王生的心臟挖出後逃走。道士最終運用法術將鬼消滅，王生也在神仙的幫助下死而復生。
與《畫皮》中的女鬼類似的是，中共通過欺騙、宣傳、恐嚇打造的看似光鮮亮麗的畫皮下面同樣是面目猙獰，同樣是以「吃人」為目的。不過，中共與單一的女鬼又不同的是，中共這個魔鬼幾十年來通過花言巧語、謊言欺騙，依靠西方的經濟、政治上的輸血，早已變得十分強大，而其藉由各種方式的洗腦，也讓無數中國人在無知中為其增加能量。
要消滅這樣的中共，除了要認清其魔鬼的真面目外，更為重要的是在行動上不再給其輸血，不再為其增加能量。在中國大陸廣為人知的「三退」運動和新興的海外爆料革命，就在喚醒著一個個中國人脫離中共，而美國政府公開區分中共與中國、中國人，制裁中興華為、眾多高科技公司，抓捕中共間諜，擬限制美國資金投入中國等，也是為了讓世人徹底認清中共，切斷供給魔鬼中共的能量。從這個意義上講，蓬佩奧的未來的演講非常值得期待。
根據蓬佩奧提前透露的信息，他將在未來的演講中涉及如下話題：
第一個話題是美、中相互競爭的意識形態和價值觀，及其對美國及全世界的影響。蓬佩奧認為，中共是一個著重於鬥爭和國際統治的馬克思-列寧主義政黨。只需要聽聽他們領導人的話就可知曉。在這種模式中，一個列寧主義政黨進行統治，而且人人都必須按照共產黨精英的意願來思考及行事。
此前彭斯在演講中也傳遞了同樣的信息，那就是美、中兩個國家在信仰、價值觀和社會制度方面的根本性差異，決定了兩國關係的走向。如果中共領導人不改變自身，不去擁抱普世價值，美國絕沒有可能去接納它。基於這樣的認知，美國一定會以更加強硬的姿態應對中共的挑戰。
第二個話題是中共是如何干預在美國認為最理所當然的事情的。那就是「中共的情報機構、統戰部及其宣傳分支已經發起一場把公眾輿論導向傾向於北京的全球運動。我們要維護我們的自由——我們的言論自由，而且我們要確保信息在每一個地方都自由地流動。」
蓬佩奧顯然針對的是中共在間諜層面、統戰和宣傳層面對美國非同一般的滲透，以及中共利用美國的自由從中漁利的惡行。近兩年美國FBI抓捕的將美國高科技泄密給中共的幾個華裔科學家和中共國安人員，中共封殺NBA、《南方公園》，迫使蘋果、暴雪等西方公司向其叩頭，用孔子學院脅迫美國大學，都是明證。或許，蓬佩奧未來演講時會透露更為詳盡的信息。
蓬佩奧將涉及的第三個話題是國際秩序受到的影響。他指出，中共正在積極地創造它自己的國際空間，而且它參與國際組織以使其專制體制得以存在並擴大其範圍。
從越來越多的報導中，世人可以看到，中共通過「一帶一路」正在希冀打通稱霸全球的通道，而其更是藉由在國際組織領導層安插中國人，來讓國際組織為自己服務，比如國際刑警組織、聯合國國際電信聯盟、聯合國工業發展組織等。目前，美國已經掌握了很多證據，蓬佩奧未來或許會公布更多的內情。而對此，美國和西方國家必須想出合理有效的方式應對，否則中共將會繼續蠶食更多國際組織，施加更多影響。
第四個話題是經濟。蓬佩奧認為，中共從事不公平的掠奪性經濟行為，而且利用國有資產在全世界各地打下其經濟足跡。「我們希望中國成功。我們希望它有一個成功的經濟。但是我們希望有一個透明的、有競爭性的、由市場驅動的惠及所有參與方的體系。」美中貿易戰的核心問題無疑就是要推動中共經濟走向透明、走向真正的市場化。而如何推動中共改變，蓬佩奧將來的演講，極有可能在美國現有行動的基礎上，更全面詮釋美國的政策。
除此而外，蓬佩奧還打算談及美國的軍隊是如何競爭的，以及中國（中共） 所建立的遠遠超出他們的自衛所需的有關能力。他或許同樣會披露更為詳細的內容。
在筆者看來，蓬佩奧未來針對每個話題進行的一系列講話，就是在將中共魔鬼披著的看似美麗的外衣一步步剝去，從而讓更多的美國人，更多的西方人，更多的中國人，更多的世人，真切地意識到中共才是對世界最大的威脅，必須將其徹底從這個世界上剷除。只有這樣，中國才能走向自由，中國才能與世界公平的進行商務往來，中國人的聰明才智可以得到充分發揮。
正如蓬佩奧所言，美國政府「必須以全新的、非常規的思維方式來思考中華人民共和國」，而且「同中國接觸要基於其現狀，而不是我們所希望的狀況」。這實際上在說，美國早已從幻夢中醒來，對於當下堅決走邪路、死路的中共，美國絕不會妥協。

Zhou Xiaohui: Pompeo is gradually uncovering the paintings of the CCP

07 Nov 2019, 06:57

After the US Vice President Peng Si delivered a heavy speech on China policy on October 24, on the 30th, US Secretary of State Pompeo’s speech at the Hudson Institute once again clearly distinguished the Chinese Communist Party and China and the Chinese. The CCP is not equal to China and does not mean the Chinese people. Pompeo said: ""The United States has always cherished the friendship with the Chinese people, but the Chinese government is not the same thing as the Chinese people."" ""The CCP is seeking to challenge the United States and the world in various ways. All of us must face each other."" These challenges.""
This clear distinction has made the CCP, which has been hidden behind China and kidnapped 1.4 billion Chinese, surfaced. This shows that the United States and the world realize that it is the CCP’s use of the power stolen in its hands. It has harmed the Chinese for decades and suppressed the faith. Destroying Chinese culture, doing all the bad things, and using the market and money to buy Western political figures and elites from all walks of life, exporting the value system and behavior of the CCP to the whole world constitutes a challenge to the United States and the world. For the evils of the CCP, the Chinese who were oppressed and maimed also hated it.
For such a CCP, Pompei has unceremoniously pointed out: ""Today, we finally realize the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party is truly hostile to the United States and our values, and its worse words and deeds and influence on us."" In the middle of the month, I will deliver a series of speeches. I will talk more specifically about each of these issues.""
Pompeo’s remarks made the CCP tremble, because he not only clearly pointed out the CCP’s strong hostility and influence on the United States and its values, but also suggested that the real problem of the two sides is the difference in values, and He will also smash and smash, and in the future speech, the CCP’s bad words and deeds will come out one by one. Borrowing the old man of the early Qing Dynasty, Pu Songling’s old saying, it is to pluck the CCP’s paintings layer by layer.
In the ""Strange Tales from a Lonely Studio"" written by Mr. Pu Lao, there is a story called ""Painted Skin"", which tells a story of a surnamed Wang Sheng who encounters a beautiful woman who is homeless in the morning. Wang Sheng sympathizes with his encounter, 遂Take it home and hide it in the study. Unexpectedly, this is a special kind of ghost that has been eaten by people. Behind the beautiful human skin is a ""green face, a long, sharp, saw-like tooth."" When the Taoist priests saw his true face, he could not bear to hurt his life because of his pity. Therefore, he only wanted to scare him away with the dust; but the ghost in the human skin was angry and angered, and he dug out the heart of Wang Sheng and fled. The Taoist priest eventually used the spell to destroy the ghost, and Wang Sheng died with the help of the gods.
Similar to the female ghosts in Painted Skin, the seemingly glamorous paintings created by the CCP through deception, propaganda, and intimidation are also the same as the ""eat"". However, the difference between the CCP and the single female ghost is that the CCP, the devil, has been deceived through rhetoric and lies for decades, relying on Western economic and political blood transfusions, and has become very powerful, and it has been brainwashed by various means. It has also enabled countless Chinese to increase their energy in ignorance.
To eliminate such a CCP, in addition to recognizing the true face of its devil, it is even more important to no longer give blood to its actions and no longer add energy to it. The well-known ""three retreats"" movement in mainland China and the emerging overseas revolutionary revolution are awakening the Chinese people to leave the CCP. The US government publicly distinguishes the CCP from China and the Chinese, sanctions ZTE Huawei, and many high-tech companies. The arrest of CCP spies, and the proposed restriction of US funds to invest in China, is also to let the world thoroughly understand the CCP and cut off the energy supplied to the CCP. In this sense, Pompeo's future speech is very worth looking forward to.
According to the information disclosed by Pompeo in advance, he will cover the following topics in his future speeches:
The first topic is the ideology and values of the United States and China, and their impact on the United States and the world. Pompeo believes that the CCP is a Marx-Leninist party that focuses on struggle and international rule. Just listen to their leaders and you will know. In this model, a Leninist party rules, and everyone must think and act in accordance with the will of the Communist elite.
Previously, Peng Si also conveyed the same message in his speech, that is, the fundamental differences in beliefs, values, and social systems between the two countries in the United States and China have determined the direction of bilateral relations. If the CCP leaders do not change themselves and do not embrace universal values, the United States will never accept it. Based on this understanding, the United States will certainly respond to the challenges of the CCP in a more tough stance.
The second topic is how the CCP intervenes in what the United States considers to be the most natural. That is, ""The CCP's intelligence agencies, the United Front Department and its propaganda branch have launched a global campaign to turn public opinion toward Beijing. We want to preserve our freedom - our freedom of speech, and we want to ensure that information is everywhere. They are free to flow.""
Pompeo apparently aimed at the CCP's extraordinary penetration of the United States at the spy level, the united front and the propaganda level, and the CCP's use of the freedom of the United States to profit from it. In the past two years, the US FBI has arrested several Chinese scientists and CCP national security personnel who have leaked American high-tech to the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party blocked the NBA and South Park, forcing Western companies such as Apple and Blizzard to swear to the United States and use the Confucius Institute to intimidate the United States. The university is a testimony. Perhaps, Pompeo will reveal more detailed information in his future speech.
The third topic that Pompeo will cover is the impact of the international order. He pointed out that the CCP is actively creating its own international space, and it participates in international organizations to allow its authoritarian system to exist and expand its scope.
From more and more reports, the world can see that the CCP is pursuing a channel to dominate the world through the “Belt and Road”, and it is to let international organizations serve themselves by placing Chinese in the leadership of international organizations. For example, Interpol, the United Nations International Telecommunication Union, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, etc. At present, the United States has already obtained a lot of evidence, and Pompeo may announce more insiders in the future. In this regard, the United States and the Western countries must come up with a reasonable and effective way to deal with it, otherwise the CCP will continue to erode more international organizations and exert more influence.
The fourth topic is the economy. Pompeo believes that the CCP is engaged in unfair predatory economic behavior and uses state-owned assets to lay down its economic footprints around the world. ""We want China to succeed. We hope that it has a successful economy. But we hope to have a transparent, competitive, market-driven system that benefits all participants."" The core issue of the US-China trade war is undoubtedly Promote the CCP economy to become transparent and move towards real marketization. And how to promote the change of the CCP, Pompeo's future speeches, it is very possible to more comprehensively interpret US policies based on the existing actions of the United States.
In addition, Pompeo also intends to talk about how the US military is competing, and the relevant capabilities that China (CCP) has built far beyond their self-defense. He may also disclose more detailed content.
In my opinion, Pompeo’s series of speeches on each topic in the future is to peel off the seemingly beautiful cloak of the CCP’s devil, so that more Americans and more Westerners More Chinese, more people, truly realize that the CCP is the biggest threat to the world and must be completely removed from the world. Only in this way can China move toward freedom, and China can conduct business with the world in a fair manner, and the wisdom and wisdom of the Chinese can be fully utilized.
As Pompeo said, the US government ""must think about the People's Republic of China in a new, unconventional way of thinking,"" and ""contact with China is based on its current state, not what we want."" This is actually saying that the United States has long awakened from the illusion of dreams. The United States will never compromise on the CCP that is determined to take the evil path and die.
