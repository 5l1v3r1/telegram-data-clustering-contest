      <p>NEW YORK - Jahala Dudley and Buddy Koerner said their first summer spent trying to grow and harvest commercial hemp in Vermont was an eye-opener.</p>
      <p>But nothing prepared them for the incident that unfolded over the weekend, which still has them shaking their heads.</p>
      <p>The two business partners at Fox Holler Farms in New Haven had just completed the labor-intensive job of processing, packaging and shipping 106 pounds of organically grown hemp flower to a commercial customer in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
      <p>They said they dropped off nine boxes at FedEx in Williston on Friday and made clear what it was. Dudley said they'd used FedEx many times before with no problem.</p>
      <p>"It's all legal," Koerner said. "We did everything by the books."</p>
      <p>The boxes never made it to their destination.</p>
      <p>Officers at the New York Police Department's 75th Precinct in Brooklyn, apparently acting on a tip, seized the shipment, believing it was marijuana.</p>
      <p>A representative of the Green Angel CBD shop was then arrested as he arrived to pick it up.</p>
      <p>The NYPD appeared pleased with its handling of the case. On Monday, the department posted a photograph on Facebook showing their officers posing with the cache. On Twitter they congratulated the two cops for their "relentless follow-up" that helped confiscate "106 pounds of marijuana that was destined for our city streets."</p>
      <p>Dudley was flabbergasted.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking at it. It's the stuff you see in movies," Dudley told NBC5. "Like, these two cops are holding our hemp, like it's an awesome drug bust! This is hemp!"</p>
      <p>One detective who Dudley said she spoke with by phone seemed unaware of the distinction between marijuana, which is illegal under federal law, and its cannabis cousin, hemp.</p>
      <p>A person looking at packaged hemp "can't tell the difference" she said. "Genetically it's a very similar plant. I'm not blaming anyone for that. But the paperwork was there. We've had it all tested."</p>
      <p>Under the law, hemp must contain ultra-low levels of the active psychoactive ingredient THC, which gives marijuana users a "high."</p>
      <p>Hemp is, however, prized for its CBD content, which offers a calming effect without intoxication, advocates say.</p>
      <p>The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill made commercial hemp production and shipment legal in all 50 states.</p>
      <p>Police appeared to ignore the documentation inside each box, Dudley said, including copies of their Vermont state-issued hemp growers' license along with independent lab testing confirming the hemp had "nondetectable levels" of THC.</p>
      <p>The Fox Holler Farms shipment was a particularly high-grade strain of hemp, from Oregon seed, and was expensive to produce, Koerner said. The Brooklyn CBD retailer had agreed to pay $17,500 for the shipment.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Vermont agriculture leaders said they contacted New York Agriculture Commissioner Richard Ball, to make him aware of the situation, hoping he might help sort out the confusion.</p>
      <p>So far, the New York Police Department has declined to answer questions about the controversy.</p>
      <p>The NYPD spokeswoman, Sgt. Mary Frances O'Donnell, told NBC5 on Tuesday evening only that "the investigation is active and ongoing."</p>
      <p>The department's Facebook and Twitter postings have generated about 2,000 comments, many of which were critical of the handling of the case.</p>
      <p>Dudley said she is hoping the police makes things right.</p>
      <p>For now, she said, the perishable hemp shipment remains in police custody.</p>
      <p>"We have a limited product, a limited crop," Dudley said. "This shipment will make or break the farm this year. If this sale goes through, we'll be OK. If it doesn't, we don't break even."</p>
      <p>She added that a Vermont lawyer has advised making one other change going forward -- and switch to the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
