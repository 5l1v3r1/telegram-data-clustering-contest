中國推出最新「電玩宵禁」：未成年每天限時90分鐘、22點以後不得上線
07 Nov 2019, 06:20 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是中國國家新聞出版署5日發出一項電玩禁令，將嚴格控制未成年人使用網路遊戲時段與時間，為避免盜用身分，也將推行「實名註冊」。



中國國家新聞出版署近日推出一項「電玩宵禁」，限制未滿18歲的未成年人在晚上10點之後、早上8點之前不准打電玩遊戲，平日最多只能玩90分鐘，假日與假期雖然放寬，但仍不能超過3小時，且避免「借用帳號」的身分認證漏洞，政府也要求網路遊戲企業自通知施行日起的2個月內，要求所有用戶完成「實名註冊」，沒有實名註冊的用戶，則將被停止遊戲服務。
為了遏制未成年人沉迷網絡遊戲、過度消費，中國國家新聞出版署5日發出《關於防止未成年人沉迷網絡遊戲的通知》 （以下簡稱《通知》），將嚴格控制未成年人使用網路遊戲時段與時間，每日晚間10點至隔日8點，遊戲業者不得為未成年人提供遊戲服務。另外也明確規範遊戲業者能向未成年人提供服務的時間為，每日累計不得超過1.5小時，法定節假日每日累計則不得超過3小時。
官方聲稱，這是為解決中國境內「日益嚴重的網路遊戲成癮與相關社會問題」，包括：青少年玩遊戲有害身心健康與發育、沒有經濟能力卻過度課金、因過度沉迷而導致家庭發展與人際關係破裂⋯⋯等等「社會隱憂」。
這樣明定遊戲時間，則是為「合理分配未成年人日常作息時間」，將扣除正常睡眠、學習、用餐等活動時間外，對遊戲時間給予限制。
因為不少未成年人使用家長帳號登入遊戲，導致管理制度難以實施，《通知》將嚴格要求「實名註冊」，所有網路遊戲用戶都需使用有效身份資訊才可以註冊遊戲。
《通知》也嚴密規範未成年的玩家為遊戲付出的金額上限，遊戲業者不得向8歲以下使用者提供付費遊戲的服務，另外8歲以上未滿16歲者，每月不得花超過200人民幣（約新台幣868元）在遊戲儲值上，16歲以上但未滿18歲者，每月上限則是400人民幣（約新台幣1737元）。

強制「健康遊戲時間」，超玩還會被歸零「經驗值」
為防範沉迷網路遊戲，中國新聞出版總署其實早在2005年就制定《網絡遊戲防沉迷系統開發標準》，利用技術對未成年人在線遊戲時間予以限制，並通知中國7家大型網路遊戲公司，要求業者向政府提出開發防沉迷系統計畫，並自2007年開始推行防沉迷系統，並要求註冊玩家提供身分證、姓名等資訊，交給公安部門核對。
根據規定，防沉迷系統會監控玩家的遊戲時間，接近3小時將給予提醒，如超過3小時，系統就會不斷提出警告，讓遊戲玩家不要繼續玩下去。同時，在3-5個小時內，遊戲中的遊戲收益（包含經驗值、掉寶率、榮譽值、聲望值等）將下降至原有的50% ，5個小時後將降為0。系統還規定，玩家玩滿「健康遊戲時間」，該帳號必須還要經過5個小時的下線時間累計間隔，才能重新啟用。
不過這次的宵禁，則更為明確與嚴謹。《紐約時報》指出，這是因去年中國國家領導人習近平在公開場合談到了兒童視力低下的禍害，給了官員們更大的執行壓力。中國網路遊戲的龍頭「騰訊」其實去年就自主啟動了「未成年遊戲限制機制」—要求玩家實名註冊；並限制未成年者的遊戲時間，12歲以下每日只能玩1小時、12歲以上未滿18歲每日最多2小時，時間到了就會被迫退出遊戲。
中國公安局恐全面掌控遊戲時間惹議
針對這次禁令，中國最大的遊戲公司騰訊表示將配合國家禁令，與執法部門合作建立年齡識別系統，賦予遊戲公司使用嚴格的使用者身份審查的權力，一旦未成年人超時玩遊戲，將被遊戲端強制停止。
《轉角國際》報導，國家新聞出版署的命令發出後，中國的社群網路也掀起了一波熱門討論，「#未成年人22点至8点禁玩网游」的關鍵字，也登上了微博的話題熱搜榜。
然而未來若施行「統一實名註冊」，並將資料交付中央政府、與公安局控管，是否將與試驗中的「社會信用點數制度」相連結？全國玩家的遊戲個資與網路使用習慣，又會在中央政府的控制下，出現怎樣的「應用」？來自歐美國家的外商遊戲，又該如何回應中國政府對用戶資料的權限要求？種種問題，也讓中國的「天網恐懼」進一步升溫。


天網恢恢、信賞必罰：「中國社會信用體系」即將全面上路


中國的線上遊戲產業是全球最大的遊戲產業之一，年收入超過330億美元，吸引了數億用戶。不過，中國官媒將某些遊戲比作「​​毒藥」，中國政府更以某些遊戲過於暴力為由，禁止部分遊戲的銷售。此次祭出電玩宵禁限制，也是繼去年成立遊戲監管機構、加強審查上市遊戲之後，最新一波的禁令。
此外，世界衛生組織（WHO）去年第一次將「電玩成癮」被列為新型的心理疾病。

China launches the latest ""Video Game Curfew"": 90 minutes per day for minors and no online after 22:00
07 Nov 2019, 06:20 by Abby Huang


What we want you to know is that the China National Press and Publication Administration issued a video game ban on the 5th that will strictly control the time and time for minors to use online games. In order to avoid misappropriation, ""real name registration"" will also be implemented.



The China National Press and Publication Administration recently launched a ""video curfew"" to restrict minors under the age of 18 from playing games after 10 pm and before 8 am, and playing only 90 minutes on weekdays, holidays and holidays. Although it is relaxed, it can still not exceed 3 hours, and the identity authentication loophole of ""borrowing account"" is avoided. The government also requires online game companies to require all users to complete ""real name registration"" within 2 months from the date of notification. There is no real name. Registered users will be stopped from the game service.
In order to curb the indulging of online games and excessive consumption by minors, the China National Press and Publication Administration issued the Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games on the 5th (hereinafter referred to as the ""Notice""), which will strictly control the use of online games by minors. Time and time, from 10:00 pm to 8:00 pm every day, gamers are not allowed to provide game services for minors. In addition, it is also clear that the time that game operators can provide services to minors is no more than 1.5 hours per day, and no more than 3 hours per day for legal holidays.
The official claims that this is to solve the ""increasing online game addiction and related social problems"" in China, including: the harmful effects of physical and mental health and development of young people playing games, over-skills without financial ability, and family development due to excessive addiction. The breakdown of interpersonal relationships and other ""social concerns.""
In this way, the game time is defined as ""reasonable allocation of minors' daily work schedules"", and the game time will be limited in addition to the normal sleep, study, meal and other activities.
Because many minors use the parent account to log in to the game, which makes the management system difficult to implement, the Notice will strictly require ""real name registration"". All online game users need to use valid identity information to register the game.
The Notice also strictly regulates the maximum amount of money paid by a minor player for the game. The game industry shall not provide paid games to users under 8 years of age. In addition, those who are under the age of 8 and under 16 shall not spend more than 200 RMB per month. About NT$868) In the game's stored value, those who are over 16 but under 18 years old, the monthly limit is 400 RMB (about NT$1,737).

Forced ""healthy game time"", super play will be reset to zero ""experience value""
In order to prevent indulging in online games, the China Press and Publication Administration actually formulated the ""Development Standards for Online Game Anti-addiction System"" as early as 2005, using technology to limit the online game time of minors and notifying China of 7 large online games. The company requires the industry to propose to the government to develop anti-addiction system plans, and since 2007, the anti-addiction system has been implemented, and registered players are required to provide information such as identity cards and names, and submit them to the public security department for verification.
According to the regulations, the anti-addiction system will monitor the player's game time, and will be reminded when it is close to 3 hours. If it is more than 3 hours, the system will continue to warn the game players not to continue playing. At the same time, within 3-5 hours, the game's game revenue (including experience value, loss rate, honor value, reputation value, etc.) will drop to 50%, and will drop to 0 after 5 hours. The system also stipulates that if the player plays ""healthy game time"", the account must pass the 5 hour offline time accumulation interval to be re-enabled.
However, this curfew is more clear and rigorous. The New York Times pointed out that this was because last year Chinese state leader Xi Jinping spoke publicly about the scourge of children's low vision and gave officials greater pressure to implement. Tencent, the leader of online games in China, actually launched the ""Underage Game Restriction Mechanism"" last year - requiring players to register their real names; and limiting the game time of minors. Only 12 hours and 12 years old can be played under 12 years old. Above the age of 18, up to 2 hours per day, when the time is up, you will be forced to withdraw from the game.
China Public Security Bureau fears full control of game time
In response to the ban, Tencent, China's largest game company, said it would cooperate with law enforcement agencies to establish an age identification system in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, giving game companies the power to use strict user identity review. Once minors overtime play games, they will be gamed. The terminal is forcibly stopped.
According to ""The Corner International"", after the issuance of the order of the National Press and Publication Administration, China’s social network has also launched a wave of popular discussions. The keyword ""#Minors banned online games from 22:00 to 8:00"" is also on the list. The topic of Weibo is hot.
However, if the ""Uniform Real Name Registration"" is implemented in the future and the information is delivered to the Central Government and the Public Security Bureau, will it be linked to the ""Social Credit Points System"" under test? What are the ""applications"" of the national players' game capital and network usage habits under the control of the central government? How do foreign-funded games from European and American countries respond to the Chinese government's permission requirements for user data? All kinds of problems have further heated up China’s “Tianwang fear”.


Skynet will be restored and rewards will be punished: ""China's social credit system"" will soon be on the road


China's online gaming industry is one of the world's largest gaming industries, with annual revenues of more than $33 billion, attracting hundreds of millions of users. However, Chinese official media liked some games as ""poisons"", and the Chinese government banned the sale of some games because some games were too violent. The current ban on video game curfews is also the latest wave of bans following the establishment of game regulators last year and the strengthening of censorship of listed games.
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed ""video addiction"" as a new type of mental illness for the first time last year.


The Chinese regulatory authorities have been reorganized and the game approvals have been fully frozen.


After 28 years, WHO revised the International Classification of Diseases: Transgender is no longer a mental illness, and there is more ""game addiction"".
