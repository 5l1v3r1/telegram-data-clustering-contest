Spika wa bunge la Uganda, Rebecca Kadaga amehoji ikiwa bado nchi hiyo ina mfumo wa vyama vingi, akitolea mfano tukio la kupigwa, kunyanyaswa na kukamatwa kwa wanasiasa wa upinzani.

Spika Kadaga, alitolea mfano tukio la Jumanne ya wiki hii ambapo polisi walitumia nguvu kubwa kumkamata mwanasiasa wa chama cha upinzani FDC, Kizza Besigye na wafuasi wake.
Wabunge kutoka pande zote walihoji namna Serikali imekuwa ikiwanyanyasa wanasiasa wa upinzani.
Wanasiasa wa upinzani au vyama vya upinzani kwa jumla katika nchi nyingi za Afrika vinaonekana kuwa maadui wa vyama madarakani.
Baadhi ya wanasiasa wa upinzani na wafausi wao wamekuwa wakizuiliwa jela kwa tuhuma mbalimbali, hasa wengi wanakabiliwa na mashitaka ya kuhujumu usalama wa taifa.
