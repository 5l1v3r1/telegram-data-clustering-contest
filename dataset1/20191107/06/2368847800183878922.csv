07 Nov 2019, 06:40

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】美國聯邦調查局（FBI）探員調查波多黎各領地貪汙情形，6日上午逮捕波多黎各參議員納沙利奧（Abel Nazario）及另外7人，他們因涉嫌在各項領取聯邦資金的計劃中行竊、賄賂而遭起訴。
中央社引述美聯社報導，美國聯邦檢察官辦公室表示，嫌疑人名單中，多人過去是波多黎各西南部市鎮堯科（Yauco）的政府員工，他們因涉嫌在各項領取聯邦資金的計畫中行竊、賄賂而遭起訴。
部分嫌疑人被控挪用超過5000美元市府資金，並拿部分資金來網羅其他嫌疑人進入納沙利奧的參議員競選團隊行列。
另外一部分嫌疑人協助其他參議員的競選工作。這些參議員都是納沙利奧出任堯科市長期間所想拉攏的對象。
堯科前人事主任及市長特助都在嫌疑人名單之中。
波多黎各參議院議長李維拉（Thomas Rivera Schatz）要求納沙利奧立即辭職，他說：「很替他和他的家人感到遺憾，但更替波多黎各人民感到遺憾，這些令人傷心的事件已重創人民對政府機構的信任。」
納沙利奧向媒體表示他不會下台，說自己是清白的。
他在首都聖胡安的辦公室表示，如果自己所屬的新進步黨（New Progressive Party）認為他是阻礙，「讓他們開除我，但我不會離開，這是我的家」。
