      <p>Bayer Leverkusen sprang to life in their Champions League group as they picked up their first points with a 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid in a bad-tempered game on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>LEVERKUSEN, Germany: Bayer Leverkusen sprang to life in their Champions League group as they picked up their first points with a 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid in a bad-tempered game on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Atletico would have clinched their place in the round of 16 with a win but failed to produce a single shot on target in the first half of the Group D game and fell behind in the 41st minute when Thomas Partey headed a corner into his own goal.</p>

      <p>Kevin Volland fired the second in the 55th minute but Leverkusen had to survive a nerve-wracking finale after Nadiem Amiri was sent off for a late tackle with six minutes left and Alvaro Morata pulled one back for Atletico in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Leaders Juventus have qualified with 10 points from four games while Atletico have seven and Lokomotiv Moscow and Leverkusen three apiece.</p>
