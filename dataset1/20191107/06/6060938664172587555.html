      <p>LUCKNOW: Height became a problem in finding accommodation for an Afghani man who flew down to watch the one-day international <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> series between <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and West Indies here.</p>
      <p>Sher Khan, who is 8-feet-two-inches tall, visited several hotels in search of a place to stay but no hotel allegedly agreed to rent him a room due to his height.</p>
      <p>Disappointed and alone in a new city, Khan approached police for help and the cops took him to Hotel Rajdhani in Naka area where he spent Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of people gathered outside the hotel to see the tall man, who is a resident of Kabul. "As many as 200 people have come to see him. He is very disturbed," hotel owner Ranu said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Due to the people gathered outside the hotel, the police had to escort Khan to Ekana Stadium where the first ODI was played on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The hotel owner said the man will be staying in the city for the next four to five days.</p>
