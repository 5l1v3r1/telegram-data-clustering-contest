【金馬56】呂雪鳳焦慮騎金馬　夢見落敗竟放聲大哭
07 Nov 2019, 12:18 by 熊景玉, 蕭志傑
2019年金馬影展今（7）日正式揭幕，由張作驥執導的《那個我最親愛的陌生人》擔任開幕重任，他率領演員呂雪鳳、張曉雄、李英銓、劉承恩、林郁璋及李幼鸚鵡鵪鶉小白文鳥走上紅地毯。張作驥對於走紅毯很有壓力，笑稱「有機會還是不要當開幕片」，而入圍最佳女主角的呂雪鳳已對自己是否得獎感到十分緊張。
張作驥是第二次有作品擔任金馬影展開幕片（前次是2008年的《蝴蝶》），他自承「有機會還是不要當開幕片，要走紅地毯壓力超大的」，不過他並不擔心觀眾反應，反正一部片一定有人喜歡有人不喜歡；而入圍影后的呂雪鳳則是超緊張，還夢見自己沒得獎，表面上高興，回家大哭。
呂雪鳳說，當然想拿獎，如果沒得回家可能真的會哭。上次呂雪鳳以《當愛來的時候》入圍女配角，結果被大陸的郝蕾《第四張畫》拿走，對方在台上意氣風發的樣子呂雪鳳還記憶猶新，不過今年沒有陸片角逐，「一年才一次金馬獎，幾百部片搶入圍，入圍又有5個人搶一匹馬，肥水不落外人田嘛！不過金馬獎的精神就是不會排斥任何外來競爭，我們開大門迎貴賓，歡迎他們以後繼續來。」


呂雪鳳與張曉雄飾演一對夫妻，太太辛苦照顧丈夫多年，對方愛的卻是男人。

知名影評人李幼鸚鵡鵪鶉小白文鳥在片中客串飾演遊民「火雞哥」，他笑稱以往曾為蔡明亮客串，結果演得超爛。他在演出前恰好摔傷，四肢都在流血，大熱天整整兩週沒洗澡，打算辭演。劇組派了2位小鮮肉來探視他的情況，原本他想以「請小鮮肉幫我洗澡」條件願意繼續演出，怎知張作驥叫他不用洗了，「導演很高招，他知道我演得很爛，如果不洗澡，我就不是在「演」遊民，而真的就是遊民，這樣角色才進得去。」李幼鸚鵡鵪鶉小白文鳥透露自己「每天還是有花1小時洗『男孩子兩腿之間最臭的地方』！且他還有3個替身，有的幫他穿夾腳拖，有的幫他騎機車，簡直是超大牌的特殊禮遇。


李幼鸚鵡鵪鶉小白文鳥與李英銓片中有不少對手戲，兩人培養出好默契。

而入圍男配角，年僅13歲的童星李英銓，首次演出電影就獲得提名。眾人誇他小小年紀但相當會帶戲，「他真的是天才演員，應該要拿獎。」尤其他與李幼鸚鵡鵪鶉小白文鳥對手戲最多，兩人私下聊天時的話題也被他用到戲裡，雙方的對話擦出不少火花。只是他目前課業繁重，應該暫時都不會再拍戲。


本身即是歌仔戲演員的林郁璋（右）3歲就開始接觸歌仔戲，戲齡長達10幾年；劉承恩（左）則在對岸演出京劇。

[Golden Horse 56] Lu Xuefeng anxiously riding a golden horse, dreaming of defeat, actually bursting into tears
07 Nov 2019, 12:18 by Xiong Jingyu, Xiao Zhijie
In 2019, the Golden Horse Film Festival was officially unveiled today (7). The ""My Dearest Stranger"" directed by Zhang Zuojun was the opening task. He led the actors Lu Xuefeng, Zhang Xiaoxiong, Li Yingwei, Liu Chengen, Lin Yuxi and Li You Parrot. On the red carpet. Zhang Zuojun is very pressured to walk the red carpet. He laughs and says, ""I have a chance to not be the opening film."" Lu Xuefeng, who was shortlisted for the best actress, is very nervous about whether she won the prize.
For the second time, Zhang Zuojun has a work for Jin Maying's opening film (the last time was ""Butterfly"" in 2008). He insisted that ""there is a chance to not be the opening film, and the pressure on the red carpet is too big,"" but he is not worried about the audience. Reaction, anyway, some people must like someone who doesn't like it; Lu Xuefeng, who is behind the shadows, is extremely nervous. He also dreams that he has not won the prize. He is happy on the surface and goes home crying.
Lu Xuefeng said, of course, want to get the prize, if you don't have to go home, you may really cry. The last time Lu Xuefeng was selected as a supporting actress for ""When Love Comes"", the result was taken away by Hao Lei's ""Fourth Painting"" on the mainland. Lu Xuefeng, who looks like the other side on the stage, still remembers it, but there is no land contest this year. Only one Golden Horse Award a year, hundreds of films were selected, and five people were robbed of a horse. The fat and water did not fall outside the field! But the spirit of the Golden Horse Award does not exclude any foreign competition. We open the door to welcome VIPs. Welcome them to continue in the future.""


Lu Xuefeng and Zhang Xiaoxiong played a couple. The wife worked hard for her husband for many years, but the other person loved it.

A well-known film critic, Li Youli, and Xiao Baiwen, starred in the film as a turkey brother. He laughed and said that he had been a guest of Cai Mingming in the past, and the result was super bad. He just fell before the show, his limbs were bleeding, and he didn't take a bath for two weeks on a hot day. He planned to resign. The crew sent two small fresh meats to visit him. Originally, he wanted to continue the performance with the condition of ""please ask me to take a bath for me."" How do you know that Zhang Zuoqi told him not to wash? ""The director is very good, he knows that I played very well."" It’s rotten. If I don’t take a bath, I’m not “playing” the nomads, but I’m really a nomad, so the characters can go in. Li young parrot, Xiao Baiwen, revealed that he ""has spent an hour washing every day ""the most stinky place between the boys' legs!"" And he has three substitutes, some help him to wear pinch, some Helping him ride a locomotive is a special gift for a super big card.


There are quite a few opponents in the film of Li Xiaojiao, Xiao Baiwen and Li Yingqi. The two cultivated a good understanding.

The short-selling male support actor, the 13-year-old child star Li Yingxi, was nominated for the first performance of the film. Everyone praised him for his young age but he was quite a fan. ""He is really a genius actor. He should have a prize."" In particular, he and Li Xiaoli have the most opponents of the little white bird. The two people used to talk privately. In the play, the dialogue between the two sides sparked a lot of sparks. It’s just that he’s currently having a lot of work and shouldn’t be filming for the time being.


Lin Yuxi (right), who is a singer of the opera, began to contact the Taiwanese opera at the age of 3, and the age of the game lasted for more than 10 years; Liu Chengen (left) performed the Peking Opera on the other side.
