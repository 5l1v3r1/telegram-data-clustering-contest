07 Nov 2019, 12:39 by 陳于嬙, 李鍾泉
費玉清（小哥）連兩天在小巨蛋，舉辦告別歌壇之作《2019告別演唱會》，今日進入最終場，早一步封麥的好友江蕙特別打造「小哥號」熱氣球送給摯友，江蕙說：「我也是小哥的忠實粉絲，本來想看最終場，但怕在現場會忍不住哭得太傷心，所以用特製的氣球花籃，為小哥獻上滿滿的祝福。」
江蕙與費玉清擁多年交情，兩人陸續「封麥」，告別歌壇，江蕙私底下傳訊息，在後台也送上「小哥號」，讓粉絲與費玉清的人型立牌合照，她寫著：「Dear小哥，帶著所有人滿滿的祝福遠走高飛，飛去每個想去的地方，p.s.可別丟包我，要帶我一起去。」


早一步封麥的好友江蕙特別打造「小哥號」熱氣球，供歌迷拍照同樂。

接收江蕙的祝福，開唱前仍處於「禁語」階段的費玉清，以文字方式指「江蕙的可別丟包我，讓我印象深刻」。費玉清經紀人指費玉清與江蕙是多年的老朋友，兩人私下會聚會，因此不會特別出國去玩，費玉清今最終場演出後，將正式封麥引退，歸於平淡的退休生活，為出道46年的演藝人生劃下句點。

07 Nov 2019, 12:39 by Chen Yuxi, Li Zhongquan
Fei Yuqing (small brother) even held the farewell song ""2019 farewell concert"" for two days in the small dome. Today, he entered the final stage. Jiang Yan, a good friend of the early morning, specially created the ""Little Brother"" hot air balloon to his friends. Jiang Yan said: ""I am also a big fan of my brother. I wanted to see the final game, but I was afraid that I couldn't help but cry too sadly at the scene. So I used a special balloon basket to give my brother a full blessing. ""
Jiang Yan and Fei Yuqing have been in the relationship for many years. The two men have successively ""blocked the wheat"" and bid farewell to the music scene. Jiang Yan privately sent a message, and in the background also sent a ""Little Brother"" to let the fans and Fei Yuqing's humanoid stand up, she wrote ""Dear brother, with all the people's full blessings, go flying high, fly to every place you want to go, ps don't lose me, take me with me.""


Jiang Yan, a friend who took a step earlier, specially created a ""Little Brother"" hot air balloon for fans to take pictures.

I received the blessing of Jiang Yan, and Fei Yuqing, who was still in the ""forbidden language"" stage before singing, said in words that ""Jiang Yan's can not be lost, I am very impressed."" Fei Yuqing said that Fei Yuqing and Jiang Yan are old friends for many years. The two will meet in private, so they will not go abroad to play. After Fei Yuqing’s final performance, he will officially retire the wheat and return to his dull retirement. The performance life of the year is drawn down.


Jiang Yan did not dare to look at Fei Yuqing's last performance, and he was afraid to cry at the scene. (Reflected from Jiang Yan Facebook)
