07 Nov 2019, 12:05 by 蔡世偉
三立台灣台《寶島神很大》自2014年開播以來，不只是台灣最接地氣、最貼近傳統文化、最關心生活民俗的節目。今（7日）《寶島神很大online》 正式開站，宣布將從節目走上雲端，從電視延伸到網路。嘉賓卓毓彤（熊熊）自曝有選擇障礙，從手機號碼、租屋，到地址都靠算命，曾經為求姻緣聽信朋友介紹，跑去去拜「豬八戒」，事後才發現那是特種行業的信徒才會拜祂。
記者會中阿男道長、生活開運小導師艾莉絲分別替熊熊算命看面相，兩位老師都覺得她氣很旺，明年是有發展的1年，而且成績會不俗，老師還表示氣場能量會說話，叮嚀熊熊要少說話，而且要內斂，不過她最關心的是明年有沒有機會買房，老師表示機會大，讓她好開心。
熊熊表示自己是算命控，因為有選擇障礙，所以連吃的和人生都要靠算命讓自己安心，她笑說：「從手機號碼、租屋，到地址都要算，而且經紀人還要去算過八字，更別提求姻緣了！」

熊熊雖相信算命，但也有拜錯神明的時候，像以前求姻緣，朋友說要拜天蓬大元帥豬八戒，後來才發現那是特種行業才會去的神明。算命可讓心靈慰藉，不過卓毓彤（熊熊）曾為了心安而在朋友介紹下買了9面佛牌，花了快10萬元，而且每天要對佛牌念咒語說話就要花1小時，弄到都睡眠不足，結果最後發現受騙，九尊只有一尊有神明，其他都是空牌。
