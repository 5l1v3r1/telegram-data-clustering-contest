Jubilee candidate for Kibra Constituency McDonald Mariga has denied reports that his representatives have been involved in voter bribery.
Speaking at Kibra’s Lindi Mosque, the former footballer said the bribery allegations are being spread by ODM propagandists trying to cause chaos.
“Hio ni porojo. ukipata mtu yeyote anahonga wapiga kura, ambia polisi washikwe na wapelekwe mahakamani.”

The ex Inter Milan footballer said he is confident about bagging the win.
Asked how he feels about not being able to exercise his civic right, Mariga blamed the IEBC for not carrying out voter registration in the diaspora.
