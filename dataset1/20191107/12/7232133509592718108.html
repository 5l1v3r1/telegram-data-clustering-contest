      <p>Bitcoin’s surge from $7,300 to $10,600 woke up cryptocurrency bulls after a long slumber. And as normal, bulls have pushed extremely bullish price predictions, calling for BTC and its ilk to surge much higher by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>In fact, as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/industry-leader-anticipates-bitcoin-to-soon-hit-16000-despite-recent-consolidation/">reported by NewsBTC previously</a>, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao of Binance wrote on Twitter that he expects for the leading cryptocurrency to hit $16,000 “soonish,” citing the news that China has adopted blockchain technologies, which theoretically should have bullish knock-on effects on Bitcoin.</p>

      <p>But according to a Bloomberg analyst, who covers the crypto markets in a once-a-month commentary, a $16,000 Bitcoin likely isn’t possible, at least in 2019 anyway. Here’s why.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price Remains Trapped</h3>
      <p>Su Zhu, the chief executive of Three Arrows Capital, recently released an excerpt of a report from <a href="http://bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg’s</a> “monthly crypto market columnist.” And according to them, Bitcoin is looking a bit more bullish than bearish but remains stuck in a tight range.</p>
      <p>The excerpt reads that “the worst of this year’s Bitcoin price correction… in our view.” The analyst elaborated that they expect for Bitcoin to remain bound to the $8,000 to $12,000 range until year-end; Bloomberg wrote that increasing institutional investment and a “favorable macroeconomic environment” should produce upside potential, but that “hangover selling from 2017’s price surge” should limit the upside, and potentially create some room for downside to the $8,000 region.</p>

      <p>This analyst’s assertions echo a comment made by another Bloomberg analyst,<a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11?lang=en"> Mike McGlone</a>. Per <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/08/21/bitcoin-could-get-stuck-in-8k-20k-range-endlessly-bloomberg-analyst/">previous reports from this outlet,</a> Bloomberg Intelligence’s McGlone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Ki7_jt3OM">remarked in an interview</a> that with there being key support at $8,000 and heavy resistance at $20,000, the cryptocurrency could be stuck in that range “endlessly.”</p>

      <p>Summing up his opinion in one single — and quite morbid — thought, the Bloomberg analyst concluded by stating that he believes that the price of Bitcoin is entering “an extended hibernation.”</p>
      <h3>What Comes First? $8,000 or $12,000?</h3>
      <p>Assuming that the columnist’s assertion that Bitcoin remains “caged” is true, what will the cryptocurrency trend towards, $8,000 or $12,000?</p>
      <p>According to a number of analyses, $12,000 is more likely than the lower-end target. A <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/fractal-bitcoin-price-surge-above-10000-weeks/">fractal pointed out by Starbust,</a> for instance, largely implies that BTC will surge to the upside to retake $10,000 and beyond in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Also, a Bitcoin price model created using Facebook Prophet machine learning found that the leading cryptocurrency is likely to end the year at just over $12,000. What’s notable about this model is that it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/19/model-bitcoin-price-drop-8000-bears-done/">called the price drop to $8,000 months in advance</a>, and forecasted a ~$7,500 price bottom for BTC.</p>
