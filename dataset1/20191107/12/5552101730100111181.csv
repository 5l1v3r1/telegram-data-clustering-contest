日本心靈歌姬夏川里美日前登上年代《MUCH金點秀》，與音樂鬼才鄭進一、金曲歌后張秀卿同台飆歌，天籟美聲驚豔全場。彩排時因語言不通，阿咪老師透過逗趣的音效與她互動，夏川里美盛讚十分有趣，更說：「我比較怕生，第一次合作非常緊張，透過阿咪老師的引導馬上就解除緊張情緒。」阿咪老師則私下透露，夏川里美音色毫無瑕疵，是他入行38年，繼鄧麗君後聽過最完美的現場演唱，甚至形容夏川里美現場比CD更好聽。
夏川里美從小就唱鄧麗君的歌參加歌唱比賽，也多次在演唱會上表演鄧麗君的歌曲，走紅後因音色、曲風與鄧麗君相似，更獲「日本鄧麗君」美名。
此次在《MUCH金點秀》現場演唱，歌聲不僅驚豔工作人員，吸引眾人圍觀錄影，連樂隊老師阿咪也深受感動，他說一般錄製專輯時，會透過後製去修，而夏川里美現場演唱近乎完美，不是修出來的，超越專輯收錄的歌聲。阿咪老師更透露：「以前合作過鄧麗君，是現場演唱第一名，鄧麗君到天上了，她（夏川里美）晉升第一。」超高評價也讓觀眾更加期待節目播出。

夏川里美此次來台，主要為宣傳12月舉辦的大型售票演唱會，行程滿檔的她笑說錄影前一天還抽空到士林吃最愛的胡椒餅，更表示年底老公一起來台開唱時，一定會再一起去吃。夏川里美透露不會對兒子唱搖籃神曲《童神》，原因是「兒子很小的時候聽這首歌馬上就會睡著，長大後反而睡不著，因為太仔細聽我唱歌，後來也不好意思唱了」。
