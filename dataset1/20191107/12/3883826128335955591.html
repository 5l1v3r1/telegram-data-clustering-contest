        <b>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby son, Archie, is beginning to crawl and has his first two teeth, his parents have said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meghan Markle told stories about the six-month-old's development while visiting military families in Windsor.</p>
      <p>She was a "normal mum" discussing weaning and crawling, said one mother.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Prince Harry praised military families, saying: "I can't imagine what it's like to miss so much as they change so quickly."</p>

      <p>The royal couple met families from the Welsh Guards, Coldstream Guards and Household Cavalry on Wednesday at a coffee morning on an Army housing estate.</p>
      <p>Meghan spoke about Archie's teething as she bent down to greet children outside Windsor's Broom Farm Community Centre.</p>
      <p>She smiled at one toddler, who was holding a flower for her, and said: "Yes. Look at all your good teeth."</p>

      <p>"Archie just got two teeth. Two tiny ones, right there," she added, pointing to the middle of her own bottom row.</p>
      <p>Amy Thompson, whose husband Brad is attached to the Welsh Guards, spoke to the duchess.</p>
      <p>"My daughter Aeris is the same age as Archie and we talked about weaning and the children beginning to crawl - she's just a normal mum and it was like talking to a friend," Ms Thompson said.</p>

      <p>Most of the Coldstream Guards are on exercise in Kenya, while a large proportion of the Welsh Guards are coming to the end of a deployment to the Falklands.</p>
      <p>Harry, who spent a decade serving as an Army officer, spoke of his admiration for military families.</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievably hard. I have so much respect and admiration for anyone who has to deal with that," he said.</p>
