      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s smaller pro-European parties have announced a “remain” alliance for next month’s general election in which they will step aside for each other in 60 constituencies, covering about 10% of the seats in parliament.</p>

      <p>The aim is to deny a majority to Prime Minister Boris Johnson who plans to take Britain out of the EU if he wins the vote on Dec. 12.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats, the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru and the Green Party, along with some independent lawmakers, aim to give a free run to just one “remain” candidate in each constituency.</p>
      <p>One of their biggest targets is foreign minister Dominic Raab. The Green Party plans to stand aside for the Liberal Democrat candidate in what polls say may be a closely fought contest in Raab’s affluent constituency southwest of London.</p>
      <p>Heidi Allen, a former Conservative lawmaker who joined the Liberal Democrats, said the cross-party alliance was the first in a British national election in more than a century.</p>
      <p>The parties “know this general election is the last chance to change the path that this country is currently on,” said Allen, who was involved in organizing the pact.</p>
      <p>The first December election in Britain since 1923 is one of the hardest to forecast in years. Brexit may well trump voters’ traditional loyalties and give smaller rivals a chance to challenge the two biggest parties: Johnson’s Conservatives and the left-leaning Labour Party.</p>
      <p>Most polls so far have the Conservatives ahead - a YouGov poll this week had them leading Labour by 11 percentage points.</p>
      <p>The template for the cross-party deal was a local election in Wales earlier this year, when the Liberal Democrats seized the seat from the Conservatives after Plaid Cymru and the Greens did not run candidates.</p>
      <p>However, the alliance does not include the Labour Party or the Scottish National Party, which will blunt its effectiveness because they currently have the second and third-most MPs and support another Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>Labour’s finance spokesman John McDonnell said his party did not need an alliance to defeat Johnson. “We are going to have a majority Labour government - we don’t need any pacts,” he told a rally on Thursday.</p>
