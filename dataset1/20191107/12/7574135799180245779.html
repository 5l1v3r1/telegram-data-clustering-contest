      <p><b>Frank Ocean</b> hasn’t played live since 2017, though he’s been talking about a new album and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/frank-ocean-releases-new-song-in-my-room/">rolling out new music</a> (including at his <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/frank-ocean-celebrated-halloween-previewed-new-music-at-third-prep-party-videos/">new DJ night in NYC</a>), so we are expecting and hoping he’ll return to the stage soon. As far as we know, absolutely nothing is confirmed, but Primavera Sound director Gabi Ruiz said in a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/primaverasound/comments/dodkb8/qa_with_festival_director_gabi_ruiz_wednesday/">Reddit Q&amp;A</a> that he might be the secret headliner at Tyler the Creator’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/camp-flog-gnaw-2019-streaming-live-on-twitch-set-times-announced/"><b>Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival</b></a> this weekend, and that he’s planning to tour the US in 2020 and end at <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/coachella-2020-on-sale-friday/"><b>Coachella</b></a>. He’s also been heavily rumored for Coachella on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/">r/Coachella subreddit</a>, and a recent update to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/cnotd6/coachella_2020_confirmed_predictions_and_outs/">Coachella 2020: Confirmed, Predictions, and Outs thread</a> says that “a very reliable source” says Frank and Travis Scott are both playing.</p>
      <p>The only confirmed artist so far is <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/rage-against-the-machines-instagram-now-verified/"><b>Rage Against the Machine</b></a>, and we also know from a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/billboard-live-music-summit/8542954/coachella-paul-tollett-beychella-lineup-panel"><i>Billboard</i> interview</a> with Goldenvoice president and CEO and Coachella co-founder Paul Tollett that the festival is “95% booked.”</p>
      <p>Some have also wondered if Goldenvoice presenting My Chemical Romance’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/what-are-my-chemical-romance-teasing">first reunion show</a> means they are playing too. Again, these are all guesses and rumors. Stay tuned!</p>
