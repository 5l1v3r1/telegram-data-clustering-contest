      <h1>Pilot accidentally triggers hijack alarm, causes major security incident</h1>
      <h2>Was a typo to blame?</h2>

      <h4>Why it matters: Anyone can make a mistake at work, but the consequences can be a lot more severe in some professions. Just ask the airline pilot who accidentally set off a hijack alarm, causing a major security situation at one of Europe’s busiest airports.</h4>
      <p>The incident took place at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport earlier this week. Reports say an Air Europa pilot on a plane bound for Madrid triggered the hijack alarm just before take-off.</p>
      <p>The aircraft was evacuated, and the airport’s military police tweeted that they were responding to a “suspicious situation.” The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50325887">BBC reports</a> that parts of Schiphol's D-pier were cordoned off to the public, and while flights still landed at other parts of the airport, some were grounded for around 60 minutes.</p>
      <p>About an hour after police responded to the alert, Air Europa tweeted: "False alarm. In the flight Amsterdam-Madrid this afternoon was activated, by mistake, a warning that triggers protocols on hijackings at the airport."</p>
      <p>"Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologise."</p>
      <p>The incident was originally described as being a GRIP-3 situation, which means an event with potentially serious consequences for those in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>Exactly how the alert was triggered is still unclear. According to FAA documents, pilots can use a special transponder beacon code, typing 7500, to raise an alert for unlawful interference in the case of a hijacking, so it could be the case that the entire situation was the result of a typo.</p>
