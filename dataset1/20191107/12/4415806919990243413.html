      <h1>'I thought it was scaremongering' - Lyric FM presenter in disbelief over plan to close Limerick stuido</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:33:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/david-raleigh/" target="_blank">By David Raleigh</a></address>
      <p>Seasoned RTÉ Lyric FM presenter Lorcan Murray said he learned of the proposed closure of the station’s studio headquarters in Limerick, through a text message last night, sent from a friend who had seen the news online.</p>
      <p>“A friend of mine sent me a text at 11.30pm last night, asking me had I seen <i>The Irish Times</i> online. I was just going to bed. So, there you go. So, The Irish Times knew about it before I did,” Murray said.</p>
      <p>Sources at Lyric said they felt “snubbed” by RTÉ in the way station bosses handled the announcement.</p>
      <p>For Murray however, who left 2FM to join Lyric, and launch the station in Limerick 20 years ago, last night’s news came as something of a bombshell.</p>
      <p>Speaking this morning, he remarked how it was a particularly bitter pill to swallow, having felt that he and his colleagues have been “very loyal” employees.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s just so disappointing. I’m 31 years now with RTÉ and I would call myself a very loyal employee, and I feel very disappointed in the way I’ve been told.</blockquote>
      <p>Murray recently approached the mayor to seek support for keeping the studios on air in Limerick.</p>
      <p>“I had asked him to put forward a motion before the Council for all parties to endorse holding Lyric in Limerick.”</p>

      <p>Last May, Lyric’s Limerick staff outwardly maintained a positive outlook, despite their inner concerns about the studio’s future, after RTÉ announced it would hold Lyric’s 20 year celebrations in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The decision not to hold the celebrations in Limerick was defended at the time on “cost grounds” by the Head of Lyric FM, Aodan O Dubhghaill.</p>
      <p>After the announcement last May, Murray maintained that having a national radio station based locally was “a great feather in the cap” for Limerick.</p>
      <p>Today, Murray, who steers the station’s flagship drivetime programme, Classic Drive, said he was gobsmacked by RTÉ's plan closing down Lyric in Limerick.</p>
      <p>“I didn't think it would come to be honest, I thought it was scaremongering to be honest, you know - holding out the baby. I’ve had around 30 calls, since 8am from friends, saying they can’t believe it,” he said.</p>
      <p>RTÉ Director General Dee Forbes is due to address staff in Limerick today about the plans.</p>
      <p>Menawhile, Labour TD for Limerick Jan O'Sullivan criticised the plans to move Lyric FM to Dublin and Cork.</p>
      <p>"RTÉ is a national public service broadcaster and not a Dublin public service broadcaster," she said.</p>
      <p>“Lyric FM is part of the cultural fabric of Limerick and I cannot see how a once off windfall from closing the studio will generate enough money to cover the organizations financial difficulties."</p>
