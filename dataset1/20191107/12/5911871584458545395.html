      <p>We last heard from Fireworks way back in 2014, when the ambitious Detroit pop-punk band released their third album, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1668042/fireworks-flies-on-tape-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/"><i>Oh, Common Life</i></a>. They announced an indefinite hiatus the following year, but it appears that hiatus is now over, and dramatically so.</p>
      <p>Fireworks’ Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreFireworks/status/1192472788067590151">posted today</a> for the first time in more than two years. The tweet linked to a website higherlonelypower.com, where you can take a short metaphysical/sociological/anthropological survey and hear an epic new song called “Demitasse,” named for a small coffee cup typically used for espresso. Among the questions on the survey: Do you believe a higher power is in control of your life? Are you too busy to notice war? Cult + Time Elapsed = Religion?

      <p>The song itself is a stunner that suggests Fireworks aren’t really a pop-punk band anymore. Ranging from the atmospheric to the bombastic, it’s a grand bit of post-rock balladry built around the refrain, “Turn me into a dark cloud.” There are also electronic beats and a Sufjan-esque twee choir. David Mackinder’s familiar croak is there in the middle of it all, but otherwise it seems Fireworks have returned transformed — arguably for the better because this shit rules.</p>
