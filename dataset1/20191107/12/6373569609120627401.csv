Plymouth Argyle will have around 1,000 members of the Green Army cheering them on at their FA Cup first round clash away to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday.
It is going to be the first time the Pilgrims have played at the 28,000-seat capacity University of Bolton Stadium since it opened in 1997.
The tie has been made all-ticket for Argyle supporters, who have until 5pm today (Thursday) to make their purchases.
It has been stressed there will be no pay-on-the-day option for fans attending the game.
The Travel Club coaches will leave from outside the Devonport End at 6.30am on Saturday for the 600-mile round trip to the north-west of England.
The last time that Argyle played an away game against Bolton was in January 1993, when Wanderers played their fixtures at Burnden Park.
It will be the sixth this season that Argyle will have been watched by more than 1,000 members of the Green Army at an away match.
The previous five have been Crewe Alexandra (1,599), Newport County (1,039), Northampton Town (1,291), Swindon Town (2,300) and Exeter City (1,154).
