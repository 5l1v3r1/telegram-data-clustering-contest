Leapfrog Group releases hospital safety grades for Southwest Florida
07 Nov 2019, 12:38 by WFTX Digital Team


Several hospitals in the area received excellent grades. Lee Health Hospitals received A grades, while Charlotte County Hospitals received C grades. Lastly, NCH in Naples received D grades.

The Leapfrog Group announced its fall 2019 hospital safety grades.
Cape Coral, Lee Memorial, Gulf Coast Medical Center, and Healthpark Medical Center received 'A' grades.
Hospital safety grades focus on how hospitals protect patients from errors, accidents, and hospital-related injuries.
Not all hospitals in our area did well, however.
Fawcett Memorial and Bayfront Health in Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda received 'C' grades.
Both Collier County Hospitals NCH Naples and NCH Baker received a 'D' grade.
NCH filed a lawsuit against Leapfrog over the grades they received.
The health group announced that lawsuit earlier this week.
NCH says the group's grade is inaccurate.
The Leapfrog Group released a statement in response to the lawsuit;
Naples residents should be very concerned when their hospital system wastes money on a frivolous lawsuit disputing the free speech rights of an independent nonprofit organization.
Leah Binder, Leapfrog President and CEO.
