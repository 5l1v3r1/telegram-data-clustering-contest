      <p>Jubilee candidate for Kibra Constituency McDonald Mariga has denied reports that his representatives have been involved in voter bribery.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Kibra’s Lindi Mosque, the former footballer said the bribery allegations are being spread by ODM propagandists trying to cause chaos.</p>
      <p>“Hio ni porojo. ukipata mtu yeyote anahonga wapiga kura, ambia polisi washikwe na wapelekwe mahakamani.”</p>

      <p>The ex Inter Milan footballer said he is confident about bagging the win.</p>
      <p>Asked how he feels about not being able to exercise his civic right, Mariga blamed the IEBC for not carrying out voter registration in the diaspora.</p>
