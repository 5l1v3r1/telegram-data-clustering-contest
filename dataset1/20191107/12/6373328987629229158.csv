It’s November. Whether you’re a humbug or yulephile, you can’t avoid the season, whether it’s Mariah Carey’s perennial tune echoing through supermarkets, or the erection of trees and decorations everywhere you see.
But, as the nights grow darker and colder, is there a more wholesome feeling than sitting down to a classic Christmas movie with a cuppa?

Sony launched their 24/7 Christmas movie channel back in September, offering up a never-ending stream of seasonal schmaltz.

Christmas films are filled to the brim with goodwill, generally always aiming for a positive message. It’s a Wonderful Life may feel like an onslaught of misery for much of its run-time, but its coda is triumphantly happy, sparking universal tears.

Elf is a one-size-fits-all film for the family: you’ve got jokes that appeal to kids and adults and everyone in between, and a pure handle on what the season is all about.
If, like me, you routinely watch the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special, we have a real gift in store in December. With recent reactions, it appears we won’t disappointed when the show makes its long-awaited comeback.
The Christmas countdown is on. Don’t be a cotton-headed ninny muggins, chuck a film on.
