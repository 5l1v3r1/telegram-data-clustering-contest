      <p>PORT LOUIS, Nov 7 — Mauritians are voting in the first election since Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth was installed in the job after his father stepped down in 2017.</p>
      <p>Jugnauth succeeded his father Anerood Jugnauth as prime minister without a popular vote when the older man stood down two years ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old is asking voters to judge him on his short time in office, pointing to his record on modernising public infrastructure and economic reforms in the former British colony.</p>
      <p>But he faces two opponents who say his appointment to the island’s top job amounted to little more than nepotism.</p>
      <p>After three hours of voting, some 15 per cent of almost one million registered voters had cast their ballots, according to officials in the Indian Ocean state.</p>
      <p>“I voted early to avoid long queues,” Sunita, a voter in her 40s, told AFP in the central town of Curepipe. She did not want to say who she voted for, commenting only that change should not be stopped.</p>
      <p>Businessman Saoud, 55, who was casting his vote in the coastal village of Trou d’Eau Douce, told AFP he admired opposition leader Navin Ramgoolam, adding: “I’m not happy with the performance of the current government with regards to small businesses.”</p>
      <p>Campaigning lasted for two weeks, with Mauritius bedecked in the flags and colours of the rival parties. Results are expected tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The country of 1.3 million people has evolved from a poor, agriculture-based economy, to one of Africa’s wealthiest nations and financial services hub.</p>
      <p>Mauritius, comprised of four volcanic islands roughly 1,800 kilometres (1,100 miles) off the eastern coast of Africa, is predominantly Hindu but has sizeable Christian and Muslim minorities.</p>

        <b>New alliances</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the first time in decades, three distinct political blocs will vie for power in the legislative elections. New alliances could be likely if none can clinch an absolute majority.</p>
      <p>Jugnauth heads the centre-right Morisian Alliance while Navin Ramgoolam, a two-time former premier leads the centre-left National Alliance and one of his former allies Paul Berenger is going it alone with his Mauritian Militant Movement.</p>
      <p>Berenger, who briefly served as prime minister between 2003 to 2005, has denounced dynastic politics and accused Jugnauth of presiding over “scandals of all kinds”.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has banked on the strength of the Mauritius economy — it grew 3.8 per cent in 2018 — and key reforms such as introducing a minimum wage and hiking pensions.</p>
      <p>Mauritius has increasingly come under fire for helping global companies avoid paying taxes — often in poor African nations — and was until October on a European Union watch list.</p>
      <p>General unemployment, while low compared to the rest of the continent, also remains high among youth at 22 per cent, and inequality is seen to be rising.</p>
      <p>Voters are choosing 62 MPs — 60 from the main island of Mauritius, and two from Rodrigues, a small island some 600 kilometres (370 miles) to the east.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission then appoints eight other representatives from among those not elected, but who received a high number of votes, to rebalance the distribution of seats between parties and communities in the national assembly. — AFP</p>
