ISO長期列台灣為中國一省 監委促請行政院重視

（中央社記者葉素萍台北7日電）監委張武修今天說，國際標準組織在ISO 3166「國家及所屬機構名稱代碼」，長期不法並不當將國名列台灣為中國一省，並阻礙參與ISO相關議題合作參與案，促請行政院整合各部會重視並改進。
監察院今天發布新聞稿指出，國際標準組織（ISO）從1974年在ISO 3166「國家及所屬機構名稱代碼」中，長期不法並不當以Taiwan （Province of China）（台灣，中國一省）名稱列示國名，以及阻礙ISO相關議題合作參與案，監察院財政及經濟委員會、外交及僑政委員會聯席會議6日已通過調查報告，促請行政院督促相關部會檢討改進。
張武修受訪指出，這個不只是標準制定的議題而已，而是ISO訂出一個名字，其他國家、機構沿用這個名字，造成中華民國台灣其他的業務受到影響，這個不能輕忽。
張武修說，ISO於1947年正式成立，中央標準局（現為經濟部標準檢驗局）是創始會員國之一，並曾擔任理事會理事；1949年政府來台後，因未繳納會費，經ISO理事會於1950年決議停止中華民國在該組織會籍；1953年被撤銷會籍。
張武修表示，政府雖於1956年申請繳付3年會費，以期恢復會籍，但遭「前蘇聯」強力反對，致中華民國失去會籍；其後十餘年，政府因受ISO種種阻礙，未能再積極爭取恢復會籍；等到1971年中華民國喪失聯合國會籍，ISO1974年發布ISO 3166「國家及所屬機構名稱代碼」，不法以Taiwan （Province of China）名稱列示國名；更擴散至國際間許多類似「不當列示我國名」情況；1978年中國成為ISO會員，並成為理事會理事，使中華民國要重返該組織更加困難。
此外，張武修說，2000年之後，外交部及相關駐外館處重新嘗試與ISO交涉但未獲正面結果，雖因國際政治現實難歸責；但經濟部及負責標準化的主管機關沒有積極主動整合並提升量能，結合外交部，務實參與必要國際組織，爭取重要國家及國人支持，強化國際標準化及經貿科技產業，保障國家利益。
張武修也提到，2007年外交部委請律師向瑞士日內瓦邦初審法院提起民事侵權行為訴訟，要求ISO正名為Republic of China（Taiwan）（中華民國台灣）。
他說，雖然此案最終經瑞士聯邦法院另以外交承認與否的政治考量，作出無管轄權的不受理判決，但該案5名承審法官肯定中華民國有權作為訴訟當事人的一造，符合國家要件，具有國際法人地位及訴訟當事人能力等，對中華民國有利的結論與正面回應，有助於之後於國外法院進行訴訟時，做為法律地位主張有利的依據。
張武修強調，國家標準的制定及國際標準資訊接軌攸關國家競爭力，經濟部未能確實整合跨部會資源，不易發揮綜效。
他說，標準制定或修正涉及多元領域專業，只憑經濟部標準檢驗局之力，難以適應國際競爭局勢，行政院應強化協調聯繫各相關部會，妥善進行資源配置，提升實效。（編輯：蘇龍麒）1081107

ISO has long been listed as a province of China. The JISC urged the Executive Yuan to pay attention to it.
07 Nov 2019, 12:54 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Ye Suping, Taipei, 7th) The supervisory committee Zhang Wuxiu said today that the International Standards Organization in ISO 3166 ""National and Affiliated Organization Name Codes"" has long been illegal and not listed as a province of China and hinders participation in ISO-related issues. In the case, the Executive Yuan is urged to integrate the ministries to pay attention to and improve.
The Supervisory Office issued a press release today stating that the International Standards Organization (ISO) has been in the name of Taiwan (Province of China) (Taiwan, China) since 1974 in ISO 3166 ""National and Affiliate Name Codes"". On the 6th, the Joint Meeting of the Finance and Economic Committee of the Inspectorate, the Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee has passed the investigation report, and urged the Executive Yuan to urge the relevant ministries to review and improve.
Zhang Wuxiu pointed out that this is not just a matter of standard setting. Instead, ISO has set a name. Other countries and institutions have used this name, which has caused other businesses in the Republic of China and Taiwan to be affected. This cannot be ignored.
Zhang Wuxiu said that ISO was formally established in 1947. The Central Bureau of Standards (now the Standards Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs) was one of the founding members and served as a council member. After the government came to Taiwan in 1949, due to the failure to pay membership fees, ISO In 1950, the Council decided to stop the membership of the Republic of China in the organization; in 1953, it was revoked.
Zhang Wuxiu said that although the government applied for a three-year membership fee in 1956 to restore membership, it was strongly opposed by the ""former Soviet Union"" and lost the membership of the Republic of China. For the next ten years, the government failed due to various obstacles of ISO. Actively strive to restore membership; until the Republic of China lost its membership in 1971, ISO issued 1974 ""ISO 3166 ""name of the country and its affiliated name"", illegally listed in the name of Taiwan (Province of China); more spread to the international Many of them were similar to the ""inappropriately listed names of our country""; in 1978, China became an ISO member and became a council member, making it even more difficult for the Republic of China to return to the organization.
In addition, Zhang Wuxiu said that after 2000, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and related foreign libraries re-attempted to negotiate with ISO but did not receive positive results. Although the international political reality is difficult to blame, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the competent authorities responsible for standardization did not actively integrate. And to improve the amount of energy, in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pragmatically participate in the necessary international organizations, strive for the support of important countries and people, strengthen the international standardization and economic and trade technology industry, and safeguard national interests.
Zhang Wuxiu also mentioned that in 2007, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested lawyers to file a civil tort lawsuit in the court of first instance in the Swiss state of Geneva, requiring ISO to be called Republic of China (Taiwan) (Taiwan, Republic of China).
He said that although the case was finally subject to the political consideration of diplomatic recognition in the Swiss Federal Court and made a non-jurisdictional inadmissibility judgment, the five trial judges in the case affirmed the right of the Republic of China as a litigant. In line with national requirements, with the status of international legal person and the ability of litigants, the favorable conclusions and positive responses to the Republic of China will help to serve as a basis for legal status claims when litigating in foreign courts.
Zhang Wuxiu stressed that the formulation of national standards and the integration of international standards information are crucial to the competitiveness of the country. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has not been able to integrate the resources of inter-ministerial associations and it is not easy to play a comprehensive role.
He said that standard formulation or amendment involves multi-disciplinary majors. It is difficult to adapt to the international competition situation only by the strength of the Bureau of Standards and Inspection of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Executive Yuan should strengthen coordination and contact with relevant ministries, properly allocate resources and improve actual results. (Editor: Su Longzhen) 1081107
