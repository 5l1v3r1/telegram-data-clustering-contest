      </p>
      <p>Former Santos prodigy Rodrygo has made an impressive start to life at the Spanish giants, having already scored five goals in his first six senior matches for the club.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old has the chance to follow in the footsteps of many great Brazilians who have played for the 13-time Champions League winners, as does his teammate Vinicius Junior, although he seems to have fallen down the pecking order under Zinedine Zidane of late.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/real-madrid/uefa-champions-league-report-real-madrid-v-galatasaray-06-november-2019/666915">Rodrygo scored three times in his team's 6-0 win over Galatasaray</a> on Wednesday night, and provided the assist for another goal, showing plenty of promise for the future.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Brazilian with the most appearances for Real is legendary left-back Roberto Carlos, who played 527 matches in 11 years for the club. Carlos is still remembered fondly by Los Blancos' loyal fans, leaving a legacy Rodrygo will hope to emulate.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Ronaldo Nazario joined the LaLiga giants from Inter Milan, and went on to spend five years in Madrid. The former striker, widely considered the greatest No. 9 of all time, had fans on the edge of their seats when he was on the field, scoring 104 times in 177 matches for Real.</p>
      <p>Another big-name Selecao star who wore the iconic white shirt was Robinho, who, like Rodrygo, came through Santos' youth academy in Brazil.</p>
