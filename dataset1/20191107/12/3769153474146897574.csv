Here 27 other addons which I checked in Blender 2.81.Video is 25 minutes, and you see on the top of the video what addon is discussed, and you see the previous and next addons as well. Since the addons are alphabetically listed, is quite easy to navigate in the video.I made this video to stimulate the Blender Addons climate. For example developers get more attention, users get an idea what is available, etc. Development of addons by community could indirect stimulate blender Development.
