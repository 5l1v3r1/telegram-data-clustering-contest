綜藝天王吳宗憲除了在演藝圈撐起一片天，在副業上也經營的有聲有色，近日上《TVBS看板人物》接受方念華專訪，搞笑表示自己副業投資雖然遍及房地產、餐飲業及科技業等，但不能聊成功經驗，因為這樣只能錄半集，並自謙說：「可是我聊失敗，可以聊八集！」自嘲入行32年，在演藝圈如同「台灣標準箭靶」對於自己一直處於被誤解的狀態，他也學會自我療癒，認為「被誤解也是演藝事業的一部份」。
多年前吳宗憲手上曾同時有6個節目，但卻陸續收掉，他自認很明白自己要什麼：「我從來沒有變不好笑，只是我對這件事已經不再眷戀！」從商後，吳宗憲在工廠很快樂，那是生命中不斷在呼喚他的事，他不想再當一個被盤算的人。對吳宗憲來說，當時「轉商」是個逃脫，只要離開藝能界，他就能重新做人、洗白人生。
先前LED燈事業失敗收場，吳宗憲表示：「我做得太早了！」但賠錢也不代表結束，他從沒停止過耕耘，對吳宗憲來說那是一門非常重要的課程，現在研發、製造和行銷他全學會了。

演藝生涯中，吳宗憲常成為被攻擊的對象，活像是「台灣標準箭靶」，面對黃安、館長及陳沂等人的批評，吳宗憲無奈地說：「這一串的人我都不認識」。面對網友的酸言酸語，他提出了一個「二八理論」，他解釋「或許100個人中有20個人在罵你，但是你應該要在乎的是那80個愛你的人！」方念華有感而發詢問：「你就是靠這樣度過漫長的演藝生涯？」吳宗憲坦言：「就是一種自我催眠。」，認為「被誤解也是演藝事業的一部份」。
深受父母親「處處為人好」的家風影響，吳宗憲提拔後輩不餘遺力，自覺自己得到的愛太多，所以從不吝於成就他人。吳宗憲透露當年因為受美國301條款影響，電視台遭禁播MV，於是他在自己的電視台，下了五千多萬的廣告，只播周杰倫的MV，成就亞洲天王。吳宗憲誇口說：「從數量來說，拉過的人要比我多的，算是比較不可能！」方念華笑回：「如果跟小燕姐的子弟兵相比呢？」吳宗憲秒答：「小燕姐在精不在多！」

Self-deprecating for 32 years, in the entertainment industry as ""Taiwan Standard Arrow Target"" has been misunderstood for himself. In the state, he also learned to heal himself and thought that ""misunderstanding is also part of the acting career.""
Many years ago, Wu Zongxian had six programs at the same time, but they gradually accepted them. He himself knew that he wanted something: ""I have never changed to laugh, but I am no longer attached to this matter!"" Wu Zongxian is very happy at the factory. It is something that is constantly calling him in his life. He does not want to be a person who is being counted. For Wu Zongxian, at that time, ""transfer"" was an escape. As long as he left the art world, he could re-do and wash his life.
When the previous LED lamp business failed, Wu Zongxian said: ""I did it too early!"" But losing money does not mean ending. He never stopped working. It is a very important course for Wu Zongxian, now R&D, manufacturing and He has learned all about marketing.

In the face of criticisms from Huang An, curator and Chen Yu, Wu Zongxian said helplessly: ""I don't know this string of people."" ""."" In the face of the sour words of netizens, he proposed a ""two-eighth theory"". He explained that ""perhaps 20 of 100 people are jealous of you, but you should care about the 80 people who love you!"" I was asked by feeling: ""Are you going to spend a long career in this career?"" Wu Zongxian said frankly: ""It is a kind of self-hypnosis."" He believes that ""misunderstanding is also part of the acting career.""
Influenced by the family style of the parents who are ""good at all,"" Wu Zongxian promoted the younger generation and spared no effort. He consciously got too much love, so he never stumbled upon others. Wu Zongxian revealed that because of the influence of the US 301, the TV station was banned from broadcasting MVs.

Wu Zongxian boasted: ""In terms of quantity, it is more impossible to pull more people than me!"" Fang Nianhua laughed back: ""If compared with the children of Xiaoyan's sister?"" Wu Zongxian second answer: ""Xiao Yan Sister is not at all!""
