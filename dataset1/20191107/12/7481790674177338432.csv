07 Nov 2019, 12:01

　先の参院選で国政に復帰した日本維新の会の鈴木宗男参院議員が７日、１０年ぶりに国会で質問に立った。長年取り組んでいる北方領土問題を取り上げ、健在ぶりをアピールした。
　鈴木氏は参院外交防衛委員会に出席し、「世界自然遺産となった知床半島と同じ希少生物や動物が国後島と択捉島にいる。両島の世界自然遺産登録に向けて、ロシアと相談するべきだ」と持論を展開した。これに対し、茂木外相は「信頼関係醸成、強化につながるアプローチは重要だ」などと応じた。
　鈴木氏が国会で質問を行うのは、２００９年６月の衆院決算行政監視委員会以来。衆院議員だった０２年に受託収賄容疑などで逮捕され、１０年に刑が確定して失職し、公民権回復後の１７年衆院選では落選した。

Mr. Muneo Suzuki, National Diet question for the first time in 10 years… Appealing the North Territories issue

07 Nov 2019, 12:01

Mr. Muneo Suzuki, a member of the Japan Restoration Society who returned to national politics in the previous Senate election, asked questions at the National Assembly for the first time in 10 years. Taking up the problem of the northern territories that have been addressed for many years, he appealed for his health.
Mr. Suzuki attended the House of Councilors' Foreign Defense Committee and said, “The same rare creatures and animals on the Shiretoko Peninsula, which became a World Natural Heritage site, are located on the Kunashiri Island and the Etorofu Island. I should do it. "" In response, Foreign Minister Mogi responded that “an approach that leads to building and strengthening trust is important”.
Mr. Suzuki has been asking questions at the Diet since the House of Representatives' Financial Results Monitoring Committee in June 2009. He was arrested in 2002 when he was a member of the House of Representatives and was arrested for alleged bribery, and in 10 years he was sentenced to work and lost his job.
