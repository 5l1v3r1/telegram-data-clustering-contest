      <h2>Paul takes on YouTube rival KSI in their rematch in Los Angeles on Saturday after the pair turned professional</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Logan Paul has admitted he broke his own sex ban in the build up to his rematch with KSI.</p>
      <p>The American YouTube star will settle his feud with his fellow social media sensation when the pair clash in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Paul has been training with former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs after turning professional for the sequel which will be held 14 months after the first fight ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>Paul had previously claimed that he was abstaining from sex for the duration of this training camp and that he had banned girls from his 'Maverick Mansion'.</p>
      <p>But he has now conceded: "There were no girlfriends, just tunnel vision, no sex all camp but just one issue a month ago... so we did four weeks.</p>

      <p>"In this camp I have never been more calm focused and confident. I truly feel like the best version of myself and better than I have ever felt and boxing is the vehicle for that."</p>
      <p>Briggs was brought on board earlier this year when promoter Eddie Hearn demanded Paul and KSI turn professional in order for him to stage the show.</p>
      <p>And the 47-year-old former boxer insists his man has the mentality to win.</p>
      <p>"He's mean right now, he's ready to fight," he said. "Everybody had to move people out of the house, we're not playing.</p>

      <p>"I called him the first week and told him he had to change as a person, that boxing will change you.</p>
      <p>"You've got to dig deep into your soul because you have to confront fighting another man. I don't care what you say, it's not easy; you can lose, get knocked out, be embarrassed.</p>
      <p>"The man's already famous so he's got a lot to lose. He took everything seriously because he knows I can't play around; this is my life, I didn't come to play."</p>
