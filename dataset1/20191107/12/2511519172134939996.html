        <p>"A year ago this tournament started, a year later I am in the final against Nonito Donaire, and I am very grateful for that,” said 26-year-old Inoue.</p>
        <p>“I’ve been watching Nonito’s fights even before I became professional, and he’s one of the fighters who I admire. I am truly proud of myself to be in the ring with him the day after tomorrow.</p>
        <p>“It’s a beautiful trophy, I like the design.</p>
        <p>“The winner of this tournament will be crowned as the greatest of the division. I am representing Japan as a professional boxer and I will show the greatest performance of my career as an answer to all the exceptions here.</p>
        <p>“The appeal of the WBSS is that we can decide who is the best in the division. I would like to be victorious, but I’m not stopping there. In the future, I want to be the greatest of all time!”</p>

It would be some statement if so.<br/> <br/><b>And Donaire's route to the final looked a little bit like this:<br/></b> <br/>Quarter-final: Ryan Burnett (RTD, 4th round)Semi-final: Stephon Young (KO, 6th round)<br/> <br/>Neither man have gone the distance in the tournament so far but it is worth noting that the fight against Burnett was brought to an end after the Brit was forced to retire through a freak back injury which was caused by a punch. Burnett had to be stretchered out of the arena and straight to hospital.<br/> <br/>Burnett managed one more fight after that but was forced into recent retirement because of his injury.</p>
