If you're feeling the Terry Bogard hype after yesterday's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate presentation and the SNK star's first day in the game, why not treat yourself to a replica hat, allowing you to be just like your new favourite fighter on the big screen?
This charming piece of Fatal Fury merchandise has been available on Fangamer for some time, but the company decided to remind everyone about it at the most opportune time. According to the product listing, it's a fully custom, 7-panel snapback hat featuring a thick, embroidered logo and white brim piping.
