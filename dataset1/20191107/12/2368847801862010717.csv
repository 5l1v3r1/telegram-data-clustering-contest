川習會延期 或阻股價進一步漲勢

07 Nov 2019, 12:13

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】標普500指數近幾日連創歷史新高，但部分專家認為檯面上的好消息已全數反映到股價中，任何的風吹草動都可能引發較大的獲利回吐賣壓，股價進一步的上漲還需要其它更多的好消息。
據CNBC新聞網報導，白宮資深官員已證實原定11月16日簽訂美中貿易第一階段協議的進程已無法保證，可能延到12月，而且會面的地點也還未確定。地點可能考慮歐洲，而非先前傳出的中國或美國。
考慮川習會地點改成歐洲的其中一個原因是，川普今年2月就說他希望在瑞士舉行相關的會議，因為瑞士是全球最中立的國家。第二個原因是12月3～4日川普預定出席在倫敦舉行的NATO領袖會議。路透社引述白宮官員的說法報導，會面的地點可能是倫敦。
美國商務部長羅斯（Wilbur Ross）4日接受彭博電視台專訪時所說，地點的決定將是協商過程中最簡單的部分。但這麼簡單的議題卻遲遲未能決定，顯示協議過程中出現了阻礙。此外，若沒有選在美國或中國進行川習會，雖省掉了國事訪問的外交繁文縟節，但凸顯美中兩國的關係將持續緊張。
至於時間方面，最早是希望安排在11月16～17日智利舉行的APEC會議進行川習會，但智利在10月30日宣布因國內抗議而停辦APEC會議。
原本市場預期川習會還可以在11月舉行，只是地點改變而已。但現在，若會議時間延到12月以後，說明美中的協議細節還沒有談攏，或者說中方提出了額外的附加條件，讓美方一時無法回應。
一般猜測，中方提出的附加條件是除了推遲12月15日美方預計加徵中國商品的關稅之外，就連9月已經課徵的部分關稅也希望有討價還價的空間，而中方也希望能解除華為的美商供貨管制。
據彭博社引述消息人士的話報導，中方協商人員已要求美方取消部分9月1,110億美元中國產品已課徵的關稅，同時下調去年開始課徵2,500億美元商品的25%關稅。
換而言之，在第一階段協議簽訂的前夕，中方正透過地點和時間無法敲定的方式，試圖探詢美方同意讓步的最大底線。而這個底線的協調過程如果一再不順遂，會不會導致川習會的時間再度延到明年，成了投資人心中的一個疑問。
對投資界來說，第一階段協議簽約的時間延期就是一個不確定的因素，或許最後證實是個假議題，但不排除在該議題操作過程中時間拖太長，不慎引發較大的獲利回吐賣壓。
週三，標普500指數一度因傳言川習會延期到12月的消息下挫約0.3%，終盤小漲0.1%至3,076點。道指則小跌0.07點，幾乎收平盤。那斯達克下挫0.3%至8,410點。

Sichuan learned to postpone or hinder the stock price to rise further

07 Nov 2019, 12:13

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The S&P 500 index has hit a record high in recent days, but some experts believe that the good news on the table has been fully reflected in the stock price. Any turmoil may lead to a larger gain. Lee back to sell pressure, further rise in stock prices need more good news.
According to the CNBC News Network, senior White House officials have confirmed that the process of signing the first phase of the US-China trade agreement on November 16 is no longer guaranteed, and may be extended to December, and the location of the meeting has not yet been determined. The location may consider Europe, not the previously transmitted China or the United States.
One of the reasons for considering the change of the Sichuan Learning Association location to Europe is that Trump said in February that he hopes to hold relevant meetings in Switzerland because Switzerland is the most neutral country in the world. The second reason is that Trump is scheduled to attend the NATO Leadership Conference in London on December 3-4. Reuters quoted White House officials as saying that the meeting might be in London.
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on the 4th that the location decision will be the simplest part of the negotiation process. However, such a simple issue has not been decided, showing obstacles in the process of displaying the agreement. In addition, if there is no election in the United States or China for the Sichuan Learning Association, although the diplomatic red tape of the state visit is omitted, it highlights that the relationship between the United States and China will continue to be tense.
As for the time, the earliest hope is to arrange the APEC meeting in Chile on November 16-17, but Chile announced on October 30 that it will suspend the APEC meeting due to domestic protests.
The original market expectation of the Chuan Xihui can also be held in November, but the location has changed. But now, if the meeting time is extended to December, the details of the agreement between the United States and China have not yet been discussed, or the Chinese have proposed additional conditions to allow the US to respond.
It is generally speculated that the additional condition proposed by the Chinese side is that in addition to postponing the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US on December 15, even some tariffs already levied in September also hope to have room for bargaining, and China hopes to lift Huawei. US supply control.
According to sources quoted by Bloomberg, Chinese negotiators have asked the US to cancel some of the $11 billion worth of Chinese products that have been levied in September, while lowering the 25% tariff on goods that started to be priced at $250 billion last year.
In other words, on the eve of the signing of the first phase agreement, China is trying to explore the maximum bottom line for the US to agree to concession in a way that cannot be finalized by location and time. If the coordination process of this bottom line is not smooth again and again, it will lead to the delay of the Sichuan Learning Fair to next year, which has become a question in the minds of investors.
For the investment community, the time extension of the first phase agreement signing is an uncertain factor, which may prove to be a false issue at the end, but it does not rule out that the time is too long in the operation of the issue, and inadvertently triggers a larger profit. Take back the selling pressure.
On Wednesday, the S&P 500 index fell by about 0.3% due to the rumor that the Sichuan Learning Association was postponed to December, and the final rose slightly by 0.1% to 3,076. The Dow fell 0.07 points, almost flat. Nasdaq fell 0.3% to 8,410 points.
