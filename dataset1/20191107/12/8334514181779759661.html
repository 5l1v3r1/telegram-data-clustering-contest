      <p>An end to the row over pay and pensions, and the legal status of flight attendants’ union UFO would relieve the company of a major headache.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa faces intense competition from Ryanair and easyJet and has reacted by cutting costs and announcing a turnaround plan for its budget unit Eurowings, which it said on Thursday was paying off as it reported better-than-expected quarterly figures.</p>
      <p>Shares in the Frankfurt-based group were up 8.5% at 1140 GMT.</p>
      <p>“We are confident of finding a way to resolve legal questions by going into arbitration,” Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said.</p>
      <p>The airline and the union have been at odds for months over UFO’s legal status. Lufthansa says the union leadership that took office earlier this year was not elected in a way that met legal requirements - a stance that UFO contests.</p>
      <p>UFO official Nicoley Baublies said his union was accepting the offer of weekend talks and would decide afterwards about formal arbitration talks.</p>
      <p>“We will make this attempt. We don’t yet know whether it will be successful,” he said.</p>
      <p>UFO for now will not prolong the two-day strike at Lufthansa’s core brand or extend it to other airlines within the group, the union said.</p>
      <h3>QUIET TERMINALS</h3>
      <p>Lufthansa on Wednesday said it expected to cancel a total of 1,300 flights on Thursday and Friday with 180,000 passengers affected.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, one of the airline largest hubs in Europe, was most affected by the walkout, with some 400 connections canceled on Thursday alone, the airline said.</p>
      <p>The departure board on Frankfurt airport’s website showed canceled flights to Germany, Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>But there were no signs of chaos. “It’s quiet in the terminals,” a spokeswoman for the airport said, adding that many passengers had rebooked onto different flights and had not shown up.</p>
      <p>The DAX-listed company this week unsuccessfully tried to challenge the walkout in court.</p>
      <p>One day of strike action would cost the company an estimated 10 million to 20 million euros, CFO Ulrik Svensson said. Even rumors of a walkout would deter customers, he added.</p>
