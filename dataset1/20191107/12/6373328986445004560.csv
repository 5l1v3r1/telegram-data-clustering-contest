It’s 4am and I’m wide awake but emotionally exhausted.I never thought I’d have to say this, but this pregnancy just wasn’t meant to be.I’ve never cried this hard in my life but with my mum by my side I know I’ll get through this.

Just a couple of weeks ago, Jane told the Mirror:

Seeing the positive pregnancy test was more exciting than seeing the winning numbers on my lottery ticket.It’s a crazy time but I am so happy.People think ­winning the lottery is the best thing that can happen to you but this is ­something that no amount of cash could buy.
Jane was 13 weeks into her pregnancy and was looking forward to co-parenting with her baby’s father, a friend called Barry.
23-year-old Jane, from Edinburgh, shot to fame in 2013 when she won £1,000,000 on the Euromillions after buying her first ever lucky dip ticket at the age of 17.

I thought it would make my life 10 times better but it’s made it 10 times worse. I wish I had no money most days.I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won.’
