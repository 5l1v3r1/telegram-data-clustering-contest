章子怡試鏡日本藝伎 曾因僅說四個字慘遭淘汰

07 Nov 2019, 12:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】擔任東京電影節評審團主席的大陸女星章子怡，11月5日以一襲黑裙亮相，在台上揭曉了丹麥電影《叔叔》捧走電影節最終大獎。
當晚，章子怡在微博晒出一組參加東京電影節閉幕式的照片，並配文：「願電影藝術永遠燦爛不朽！電影節任務順利完成了，我也要安心準備去卸貨啦！」開心與幸福之情溢於言表。
而在八天的電影節開幕式上，章子怡曾用中英雙語致辭，同時宣布自己懷二胎的消息，表示自己參加東京電影節「是一次美好而特殊的胎教旅程」。
開幕式當晚，她還在微博發文：「我來和大家分享喜悅啦，今日身分——第32屆東京國際電影節評審團主席，未來8天，我會跟其他四位夥伴在14部作品中評出七個重要獎項。今日特殊身分——愛崗敬業堅持工作的准媽媽，孕期30週，體重116斤（持續上升中）。這兩個身分都讓我無比驕傲！感謝大家一直以來對我的關心和支持！」
從東京電影節官方公布的照片中可見，已經懷孕近8個月的章子怡，身材保持得非常好，和普通孕婦相比，算是非常苗條。面對國際媒體的閃光燈時，章子怡依然儀態萬方。日媒大讚，紅毯上的章子怡，氣質優雅，雖肚大如蘿，但皮膚好得似乎吹彈可破。
電影節在介紹章子怡時，特別提到了她主演過兩部關於日本的電影：《藝伎回憶錄》和《狸御殿》。媒體評論無論是《藝伎回憶錄》中美得不可方物的「小百合」，還是《狸御殿》中的「美麗公主」，章子怡飾演的這兩個日本女性角色都非常成功。
不過，可能很多人不知道，章子怡首次試鏡《藝伎回憶錄》時是慘敗。
該片根據美國作家阿瑟·高頓（Arthur Golden）創作的長篇小說改編，故事講述20世紀初的日本漁村，少女「小百合」被賣到京都做藝伎，歷經戰爭與磨難的傳奇一生。
這部小說1997年出版後引發轟動，1998年，好萊塢導演史蒂文·斯皮爾伯格（Steven Allan Spielberg）決定把這部小說的故事搬上銀幕。當時，許多亞裔女演員都希望出演，其中不乏楊紫瓊、宮澤理惠、劉玉玲、鄔君梅、金喜善等大牌明星。
據悉，當年已貴為柏林國際電影節影后的張曼玉，也親自飛往紐約試鏡，將一個鏡頭以7種不同方式詮釋，令導演大加讚賞。
章子怡當時因電影《臥虎藏龍》在美國聲名鵲起，也希望有機會出演《藝伎回憶錄》，並找到了斯皮爾伯格試鏡。
儘管章子怡經常出國參加電影節，但英文水平並不高。為了試鏡，身邊的工作人員臨時教了她一些單詞和句子。
試鏡時，章子怡只能聽懂斯皮爾伯格說「安靜」、「開拍」「停」等，她也只說了「 Hire Me Please」，翻譯成中文就是四個字「請僱用我」。
結果，章子怡因蹩腳的英文被攔在門外。
不過，斯皮爾伯格後來覺得，《藝伎回憶錄》是一個很難講好的故事，便一直改劇本，推遲到2004年才開機。
而此時，一邊是當年試鏡的張曼玉等大牌明星，年齡已經不再適合出演充滿青春氣息的「小百合」；另一邊是因試鏡失敗的章子怡，知恥而後勇，不斷地學習英語，水平已不可同日而語。加上章子怡的舞蹈基礎有助於學習藝伎技能，因此斯皮爾伯克便決定讓章子怡出演「小百合」。
多年後兩人再見面，斯皮爾伯克還對章子怡開玩笑說：「我僱用你了，對吧！」章子怡用流利的英文回答：「是啊，都過好幾年了！」
果然章子怡的表演很出彩，與鞏俐、楊紫瓊兩位華語影壇的大明星對戲也毫不露怯。
《藝伎回憶錄》上映後入圍奧斯卡六項大獎，章子怡還連續被提名為金球獎、英國電影學院獎的最佳女主角，並擔任當年奧斯卡的頒獎嘉賓，國際地位和身價都水漲船高。
一出道就有幸遇幾位大導演的章子怡，通過塑造多個經典角色，奠定了在華語電影圈的地位。她是迄今首位獲得香港金像獎、台灣金馬獎等華語電影主要獎項的大滿貫得主，還獲頒法國法蘭西藝術與文學騎士勳章，因電影成就獲封「國際章」。
此次，章子怡擔任東京國際電影節評審團主席，不僅再次蓋章了「國際章」的名頭，還說明章子怡和日本真的很有緣分。
章子怡的成功讓很多人認為她運氣太好，不過，她對此表示：「其實，前後順序是不對的，大家忽視了我的努力，只看到了結果。」

Zhang Ziyi auditioned Japanese geisha, who was killed because he only said four words.

07 Nov 2019, 12:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Zhang Ziyi, the mainland actress who is the chairman of the jury of the Tokyo Film Festival, unveiled her in a black dress on November 5 and unveiled the Danish film Uncle on the stage. The final prize.
On the evening, Zhang Ziyi showed a group of photos on the Weibo at the closing ceremony of the Tokyo Film Festival, and wrote: ""I hope that the film art will always be immortal! The film festival mission is successfully completed, and I have to be prepared to unload the goods!"" The feelings of happiness are beyond words.
At the opening ceremony of the eight-day film festival, Zhang Ziyi gave a speech in both Chinese and English, and announced that she was pregnant with a second child, saying that she participated in the Tokyo Film Festival ""is a beautiful and special prenatal journey.""
On the evening of the opening ceremony, she also posted on Weibo: ""I will share joy with you, today's identity - Chairman of the 32nd Tokyo International Film Festival Jury. In the next 8 days, I will work with 14 other partners in 14 works. In the middle of the evaluation of seven important awards. Today's special status - love parents dedicated to work mothers, 30 weeks of pregnancy, weight 116 pounds (continuous rise). These two elements make me very proud! Thank you all the time has been My concern and support!""
It can be seen from the official photo released by the Tokyo Film Festival that Zhang Ziyi, who has been pregnant for nearly 8 months, is very well-maintained and is very slim compared with ordinary pregnant women. In the face of the flash of international media, Zhang Ziyi is still in a state of mind. Japanese media praised, Zhang Ziyi on the red carpet, elegant temperament, although the belly is as big as the radish, but the skin looks so good that the blow can be broken.
When introducing Zhang Ziyi, the film festival specifically mentioned that she starred in two films about Japan: Memoirs of Geisha and The Royal Palace. The media commentary is the ""Little Lily"" in the ""Memoirs of the Geisha"", and the ""Beautiful Princess"" in the ""The Royal Palace"". The two Japanese female characters played by Zhang Ziyi are very successful.
However, many people may not know that Zhang Ziyi was a fiasco when he first auditioned the ""Memoirs of a Geisha"".
The film is based on a novel written by American writer Arthur Golden. The story tells about the Japanese fishing village in the early 20th century. The girl ""Little Lily"" was sold to Kyoto as a geisha, a legendary life of war and suffering.
The novel was sensational after its publication in 1997. In 1998, Hollywood director Steven Allan Spielberg decided to bring the story of the novel to the screen. At that time, many Asian actresses wanted to star in, among which there were many big stars such as Yang Ziqiong, Miyazawa Rie, Liu Yuling, Yan Junmei and Jin Xishan.
It is reported that Maggie Cheung, who had already been a filmmaker at the Berlin International Film Festival, flew to New York for an audition and interpreted the camera in seven different ways, which greatly appreciated the director.
Zhang Ziyi was famous in the United States for her movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". She also hoped to have the opportunity to appear in the ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and found Spielberg's audition.
Although Zhang Ziyi often goes abroad to participate in the film festival, the English level is not high. In order to audition, the staff around me temporarily taught her some words and sentences.
During the audition, Zhang Ziyi could only understand Spielberg's ""quietness"", ""opening"" and ""stopping"". She only said ""Hire Me Please"". The translation into Chinese is the four words ""Please hire me.""
As a result, Zhang Ziyi was stopped in the English because of his lameness.
However, Spielberg later felt that the ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" was a difficult story to tell, and he continued to change the script, and it was postponed until 2004.
At this time, on the one hand, Zhang Manyu and other big-name stars who auditioned in the same year, the age is no longer suitable for the youthful ""Sililet""; on the other hand, Zhang Ziyi, who failed because of the audition, knows shame and then bravely, constantly learning English, the level is no longer Same day. In addition, Zhang Ziyi's dance foundation helped to learn geisha skills, so Spiel Burke decided to let Zhang Ziyi star in ""Little Lily.""
After two years, the two met again. Spiel Burke joked to Zhang Ziyi and said, ""I hired you, right!"" Zhang Ziyi replied in fluent English: ""Yeah, it’s been several years!""
Sure enough, Zhang Ziyi’s performance was very good, and the big stars of Gong Li and Yang Ziqiong’s Chinese-language films were also unspoken.
After the release of ""Memoirs of Geisha"", he was nominated for the six Oscar Awards. Zhang Ziyi was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award and the Best Actress of the British Film Academy Awards. He was also the guest of honor for the Oscars in that year. His international status and worth are rising.
Zhang Ziyi, who was fortunate to meet several big directors, debuted and established a position in the Chinese film circle by shaping many classic characters. She is the first Grand Slam winner to receive the Hong Kong Academy Awards, the Taiwan Golden Horse Award and other major awards in Chinese-language films. She was also awarded the French Franciscan Art and Literature Knight Medal, and was awarded the ""International Chapter"" for her film achievements.
This time, Zhang Ziyi, the chairman of the jury of the Tokyo International Film Festival, not only stamped the name of the ""International Chapter"", but also explained that Zhang Ziyi and Japan really have a good fate.
Zhang Ziyi's success made many people think that she was lucky, but she said: ""In fact, the order is not right. Everyone ignored my efforts and only saw the results.""
