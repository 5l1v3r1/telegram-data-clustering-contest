Cape Town – From a sweet romantic comedy, and a reimaging of a classic story, to the true story of two African American entrepreneurs, and a second look at Bad Boys for Life - here are four movie trailers you might have missed.

THE BANKER

Based on a true story this drama centres on revolutionary businessmen Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie) and Joe Morris (Samuel L. Jackson), who devise an audacious and risky plan to take on the racially oppressive establishment of the 1960s by helping other African Americans pursue the American dream. Along with Garrett’s wife Eunice (Nia Long), they train a working-class white man, Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to pose as the rich and privileged face of their burgeoning real estate and banking empire – while Garrett and Morris pose as a janitor and a chauffeur.

WATCH THE TRAILER HERE:





The film releases on Apple TV+ on Friday, 6 December.


BAD BOYS FOR LIFE

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as Detective Mike Lowrey and Detective Marcus Burnett. The new instalment centres on the Miami PD and its elite AMMO team's attempt to take down Armando Armas, head of a drug cartel. Armando is a cold-blooded killer with a vicious, taunting nature. He is committed to the work of the cartel and is dispatched by his mother to kill Mike (Smith).

THE PHOTOGRAPH

On Valentine’s Day, Issa Rae (Insecure) and LaKeith Stanfield (Atlanta) connect in a romance where a woman must learn from the secrets in her mother’s past if she is to move forward and allow herself to love and be loved.
When famed photographer Christina Eames unexpectedly dies, she leaves her estranged daughter Mae Morton (Rae) hurt, angry and full of questions. When a photograph tucked away in a safe-deposit box is found, Mae finds herself on a journey delving into her mother’s early life and ignites an unexpected romance with a rising-star journalist, Michael Block (Stanfield).

WENDY

The upcoming fantasy drama reimagines the classic story of Peter Pan. Lost on a mysterious island where ageing and time have come unglued, Wendy (Tommie Lynn Milazzo) must fight to save her family, her freedom, and the joyous spirit of youth from the deadly peril of growing up.
