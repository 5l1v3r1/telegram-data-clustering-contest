      <p>The 5G connectivity is one that is still evolving, and there aren’t too many phones yet that can click to this blazing network. We have a few of them already on sale in China and <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/28/vivo-x30-might-go-official-in-december-with-5g-and-exynos-980/">we’ve known for a while now</a> VIVO is working on a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/06/vivo-x30-launch-date-tipped/">dual-mode 5G smartphone</a> – the VIVO X30. The Chinese firm and Samsung mobile held a joint conference today, and instead of unveiling the device in full, the firm only <a href="https://news.mydrivers.com/1/656/656009.htm">gave us the tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
      <p>Vivo at the event announced that the VIVO X30 smartphone will be officially unveiled in China next month. A specific date hasn’t been given yet. However, we now know that the device will be powered by an Exynos chipset, and not the Snapdragon chipset this time. The Exynos 980 8nm SoC with support for both SA and NSA dual-mode 5G will power the X30, and of course the VIVO X30 Pro. The Exynos 980 SoC has two high performing ARM Cortex-A77 cores and six efficient Cortex-A55 cores and ARM Mali-G76 MP5 GPU. The modem supports E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC), which combines 2CC LTE and 5G connectivity, to maximize mobile downlink speed up to 3.55Gbps and 5G NR Sub-6GHz speeds of up to 2.55Gbps.</p>
