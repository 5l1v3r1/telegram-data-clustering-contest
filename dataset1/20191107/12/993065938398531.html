      <h1>Criminal Assets Bureau makes Co Monaghan seizures</h1>

      <p>CARS, cash, documents and electronic devices have been seized in Co Monaghan as part of a Criminal Assets Bureau probe into international smuggling.</p>
      <p>The probe is investigating the finances of haulage companies along the border.</p>
      <p>A total of seven homes and three yards or industrial sheds were searched in the county earlier today.</p>
      <p>Among the items seized were four high-performance cars and cash sums of euro, sterling and dollars worth €1,400, £600 and $900 respectively.</p>
      <p>No one was arrested.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, a lorry tractor registered in the north, a lorry trailer registered in Bulgaria and a trailer were seized at Dublin port.</p>
      <p>The Criminal Assets Bureau said the searches are not linked to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants found in a lorry container in Essex last week.</p>
      <p>A CAB spokesman said: “For over a year, the Criminal Assets Bureau has, in accordance with its statutory remit, been investigating a group suspected of being involved in various international smuggling activities. That investigation has intensified over the past two weeks.”</p>
