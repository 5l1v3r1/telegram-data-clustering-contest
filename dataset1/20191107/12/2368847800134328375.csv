【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】台灣第一名模林志玲於6月與日本團體「EXILE」成員AKIRA閃婚，近日有媒體報導兩人將於11月17日在台南舉辦婚宴。對此，好友林依晨7日出席「Cinecittà and Beyond 電影藝術古董珠寶展」，表示有收到喜帖，當下心情是「有受寵若驚的感覺耶！」

不過，林依晨表示因為收到帖子的時間太臨時，「可惜我當天已有安排，無法參加婚禮，現在還在想要送什麼禮物，很難送耶，她是如此貼心的人。」被問及地點是否在台南？她則笑著回說：「還是讓她保有隱私。」她也不知道還有哪些賓客受邀。
據《鏡週刊》報導，林志玲與AKIRA祕密籌備在台婚禮，時間地點訂在11月17日，在林志玲父親的家鄉台南後壁舉行。雖然兩人都人緣好、交友廣闊，但婚禮僅邀請至親好友，下午舉辦婚宴儀式、晚上舉行派對，目前下榻飯店及婚宴地點仍未公布，細節相當保密。

林依晨10月29日剛過完37歲生日，問及生日願望？她表示：「就是少點戰爭、少點污染物。」之前為準備懷孕計劃減少工作量，她微笑表示目前還未有進度，「我今天的服裝應該被束成20寸左右的腰了吧？所以做人進度還是一樣的。」希望懷個男孩或女孩？她笑說：「健康就好。」

However, Lin Yichen said that because the time of receiving the post was too temporary, ""unfortunately I have arranged for the day, I can't attend the wedding. I still want to give a gift, it is difficult to send it, she is such a caring person."" Is the location in Tainan? She smiled and said, ""Let her keep her privacy."" She doesn't know which other guests are invited.
According to ""Mirror Weekly"", Lin Chi-ling and AKIRA secretly prepared for the wedding in Taiwan. The time and place was scheduled to be held on November 17, in the back wall of Lin Chi-ling's father's hometown of Tainan. Although both of them are well-connected and have a wide range of friends, the wedding only invites relatives and friends, a wedding banquet in the afternoon, and a party in the evening. The hotel and wedding venues have not yet been announced, and the details are quite confidential.

She previously said that she has not made any progress in preparing her pregnancy plan. ""I should have been wearing a 20-inch waist today."" So the progress of the person is still the same."" I hope to have a boy or girl? She laughed and said, ""Health is good.""
