      <h1>Time your credit card application this bonus-friendly season</h1>

      <p>In late 2017, San Francisco couple Riley Adams and his wife stumbled upon the Halley's comet of airline credit card welcome offers. For a limited time, the card was advertising a companion pass on top of a large sign-up bonus.</p>
      <p>"We knew we had a lot of spending in one specific area coming up, and we wanted to try to shop around to get the best value for those needs," says Adams, a certified public accountant and owner of the blog Young and the Invested. "If you plan for it, you can really offset those costs (with a sign-up bonus)."</p>
      <p>If you're considering a new credit card, the bonus-friendly season from October through December is an ideal time. Your expenses on Black Friday, holiday travel and meals, end-of-the-year charitable donations and more may easily meet a large spending requirement for a juicy sign-up bonus.</p>
      <p>Here's what to know about such offers.</p>
      <p>TIMING A CREDIT CARD BONUS</p>
      <p>A sign-up bonus is a one-time incentive offered by rewards credit cards on top of any ongoing cash back, points or miles on purchases. Snagging a bonus typically requires spending between $500 and several thousand dollars within a certain time - often three months - after you're approved for the card.</p>
      <p>That level of spending may not be difficult this time of year. During the 2019 holiday season, consumers plan to spend an average of nearly $1,048 for items such as gifts, decorations, candy and more for themselves or family, according to the National Retail Federation's annual survey.</p>
      <p>Even if your expenses aren't entirely holiday-related, a little planning can still help you reap a windfall that you can use the following holiday season.</p>
      <p>The Adamses, for example, mapped their budget before applying for that airline card with the generous bonus. They met its spending requirement primarily by paying for Riley's wife's work-related expenses in 2017; they then put what they earned toward holiday travel the next year.</p>
      <p>"We used it all of 2018 to visit family for holidays - Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas - plus two domestic trips for (our) own purposes, and then flying to a major hub for an international flight on our one-year anniversary," Adams says.</p>
      <p>HAVE THE MONEY ON HAND</p>
      <p>It's not worth spending money you don't have just to chase a large bonus. If you can't pay your credit card bill in full each month, interest charges will eat away at any rewards you accrue.</p>
      <p>But if you've saved up a holiday fund, you can gift yourself a rich introductory credit card offer while you're at it.</p>
      <p>Andy Hill, host of the podcast "Marriage, Kids and Money," plans to earn a sign-up bonus this holiday season with the savings he's earmarked for Christmas gifts.</p>
      <p>"We save about $1,200 for Christmas gift shopping," Hill says. "If we're going to spend that $1,200, we might as well hit a bonus on a new credit card for us to get some cash back."</p>
      <p>OTHER FACTORS TO KEEP IN MIND</p>
      <p>As you size up a rewards credit card and its sign-up bonus, ask yourself these questions:</p>
      <p>- Can you meet the card's credit requirements? You'll generally need good credit (a FICO score of 690 or higher) to qualify for a rewards card with a big bonus.</p>
      <p>- Are you willing to pay an annual fee? The top cards - those with the highest bonuses, richest rewards and best perks - charge one. If you don't think you'll earn enough in rewards and benefits to outweigh that fee, consider a no-annual-fee rewards card. Many of them also offer bonuses.</p>
      <p>- Do the card's rewards categories match your expenses? A sign-up bonus can offer a chunk of upfront value, but the card won't be useful long term if its ongoing rewards and perks don't fit your habits.</p>
      <p>- Are you eligible for the bonus? Check the card's terms. For example, you may not be able to earn a bonus if you've already received one from the same issuer recently.</p>
      <p>- Can you meet the spending requirement for the bonus with your current budget? If you know you can't spend $4,000 in three months without going into debt, look for a bonus with a lower spending threshold.</p>
      <p>- Will you pay your bill in full every month to avoid interest? Rewards cards tend to have high ongoing APRs, meaning you don't want to carry a balance month to month. If you're already struggling with debt, a rewards credit card may not be ideal for you.</p>
