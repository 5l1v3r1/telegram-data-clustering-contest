杜汶澤舌戰陳百祥後呼籲：集中精神做對的事

07 Nov 2019, 12:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】持續了近五個月的香港「反送中」「反極權」運動，迄今依然牽動人心。一直力挺抗爭的香港藝人杜汶澤（阿澤），在5日舌戰「撐警」藝人陳百祥之後備感無奈。網民在一邊倒地支持和稱讚阿澤的同時，也同情他對牛彈琴。對此，阿澤次日在facebook請求網民：「放下對陳先生的仇恨，皆因道不同不相為謀，不要讓無緣者擾亂自己清淨的人生，集中精神做自己認為對的事。」
港台電視節目《視點31》於11月5日邀請立場對立的藝人杜汶澤及陳百祥「辯論」，引起高度關注。數據顯示，兩人交鋒的視頻在高峰時期有逾27萬人同時收看，截至目前，視頻直播已獲得逾260萬人次觀看和16萬條留言。
雙方就警暴、年輕人等話題展開舌戰。

杜汶澤引用港大的民調數字，指香港有七成人不信任警察。但陳百祥說，不相信民調，「我也可以說有七成人支持我」，並強調自己沒看到警察暴力。
當杜汶澤提到7·21元朗站白衣人無差別地襲擊市民，警方卻不管時，陳百祥稱當時是「互毆」，並認為白衣人所持藤條、木棍不是攻擊性武器，因此警察當時不能開槍制止。
10月1日，警察用真槍近距離射擊中五學生曾志健。杜汶澤表示，當時曾同學手裡只拿著一根塑膠棒，但陳百祥堅持說，自己看到曾同學拿的是鐵管。
有記者提到警察將無辜的街坊按到牆邊、按倒在地上抓捕，警察是否該被問責時，陳百祥回答說：「看熱鬧可以在家裡的嘛。」而對於警察抓捕記者事件，他則說：「我看不到這些事情。」
陳百祥早前曾到警署發表「如果自己是警務處處長，會更早開真槍」的言論，此次節目中，他繼續「撐警」。杜汶澤激動地還擊：「即使開槍的人不算無人性，那麼支持開槍的人絕對是滅絕人性！這就是為什麼今日有這麼多香港人恨陳百祥，答案就在這裡！」
節目結束後，兩人接受訪問，杜汶澤直言，沒看過陳百祥之前的訪問：「人與人吵架，要有東西可以吵的，但他（陳百祥）最可怕的地方是，他不記得自己講過什麼，完全沒有邏輯可言。」他因多次被陳百祥的歪理「擂倒」而目瞪口呆，網民一面倒地撐阿澤，並同情他對牛彈琴。
杜汶澤過後在facebook留言說，自己一肚子的氣，要去吃打邊爐消氣。
不少藝人都收看了這場直播。
徐天佑譏諷，陳百祥的邏輯就是：「我不知！我不識！我不信！我沒看到！不關我事！」
港台主持曾志豪表示：「阿澤太善良，一心講道理。但荷蘭叻（陳百祥）使出『不看不信不知』的無恥防守，密不透風。」
王宗堯看完也在fb揶揄陳百祥：「看完好想打人。等天收。我信因果！」
而經過一晚的沉澱和思考，阿澤6日再度在facebook表示：「再一次感謝香港電台，給我一個機會表達自己對反送中運動的看法。背負著社會大眾對本人的期望，我必須承認，參與該場辯論，多少是有點壓力的。如未能達到大眾所期望，深表遺憾。雖然我已盡最大努力，安忍克制，奈何才淺學疏文不精、碩學閱之難生喜，如有辜負所託，本人在此致歉。今後定當繼續努力，全力以赴，做得更好。」
杜汶澤還寫道：「在此大膽地請求網民，放下對陳先生的仇恨。皆因道不同不相為謀，不要讓無緣者擾亂自己清淨的人生。集中精神做自己認為對的事，並為受重傷同學祈禱。」並再次呼籲：「光復香港，時代革命！」

Du Wenze’s tongue after Chen Baixiang’s appeal: focus on doing the right thing

07 Nov 2019, 12:38

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Hong Kong’s “reverse delivery” and “anti-total rights” campaign, which has lasted for nearly five months, has still touched the hearts of the people. Hong Kong artist Du Wenze (Aze), who has been fighting hard, has been helpless after the ""warning"" artist Chen Baixiang on the 5th. While netizens supported and praised Azer on one side, they also sympathized with him playing the piano. In this regard, Aze next day in facebook asks netizens: ""Let the hatred of Mr. Chen be put down, because the different ways are not in agreement, don't let the ignorant disturb their clean life, concentrate on doing what they think is right.""
On November 5th, the Hong Kong and Taiwan TV program ""Viewpoint 31"" invited the opposing artists Du Wenze and Chen Baixiang to ""debate"" and caused great concern. The data shows that more than 270,000 people watched the video during the peak period. Up to now, the live video has received more than 2.6 million views and 160,000 messages.
The two sides began a war of words on topics such as police violence and young people.


Du Wenze and Chen Baixiang argued. (youtub video screenshot)

Du Wenze quoted the polling figures of the University of Hong Kong as saying that seven adults in Hong Kong do not trust the police. However, Chen Baixiang said that he did not believe in the polls. ""I can also say that there are seven adults supporting me."" He stressed that he did not see police violence.
When Du Wenze mentioned that the white people in the 7.21 Yuen Long Station attacked the people indiscriminately. However, the police did not care. Chen Baixiang said that it was ""mutually deflated"" at the time. He believed that the rattans and sticks held by the white people were not offensive weapons, so the police then Can not shoot to stop.
On October 1, the police used a real gun to shoot a five-year student, Zeng Zhijian. Du Wenze said that at that time, the classmates only held a plastic rod in their hands, but Chen Baixiang insisted that he saw that the classmates took the iron pipe.
Some reporters mentioned that the police pressed the innocent neighbourhood to the wall and arrested them on the ground. When the police should be held accountable, Chen Baixiang replied: ""You can watch the fun at home."" He said, ""I can't see these things.""
Chen Baixiang had previously posted to the police station ""If he is the Commissioner of Police, he will open a real gun earlier."" In this program, he continued to ""support the police."" Du Wenze excitedly replied: ""Even if the person who shoots is not inhuman, then the person who supports the shooting is absolutely extinct! This is why so many Hong Kong people hate Chen Baixiang today, the answer is here!""
After the program ended, the two were interviewed. Du Wenze bluntly said that he had not seen Chen Baixiang’s previous visit: ""People fight with each other and have something to be noisy, but the most terrible thing about him (Chen Baixiang) is that he does not remember what he said. There is absolutely no logic at all."" He was stunned by Chen Baixiang’s many sorrows, and the netizens fell to the ground and sympathized with him.
After Du Wenze left a message on Facebook, he said that he was going to eat and beat the gas.
Many artists have watched the live broadcast.
Xu Tianyou ridiculed, Chen Baixiang's logic is: ""I don't know! I don't know! I don't believe it! I didn't see it! It's none of my business!""
Hong Kong and Taiwan host Zeng Zhihao said: ""Aze is too kind and reasonable. But the Dutch 叻 (Chen Baixiang) has made the shameless defense of ""not knowing or not knowing"".
After reading Wang Zongqi, he also watched Chen Baixiang at fb: ""I want to beat people after watching. Waiting for the day. I believe in cause and effect!""
After a night of precipitation and thinking, Aze said on Facebook again on the 6th: ""Thanks to RTHK once again, giving me a chance to express my views on the anti-send campaign. I am carrying the expectations of the public, I must I admit that it is a little stressful to participate in the debate. If I fail to meet the expectations of the public, I deeply regret it. Although I have done my best, I have to exercise restraint and do not learn how to read. Hi, I apologize if I have lived up to my enthusiasm. I will continue to work hard and do my best in the future.""
Du Wenze also wrote: ""Boldly ask netizens and let go of hatred against Mr. Chen. Because they are different, they don't let the ignorants disturb their clean lives. Concentrate on what they think is right, and Seriously injured students prayed."" And once again called: ""Recovering Hong Kong, the revolution of the times!""
