      <p><b>MADRIDÂ (AP)</b> - The company which owns Spain*s Air Europa airline says the pilot that set off an accidental hijacking warning in Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was teaching procedures to a junior pilot at the time.</p>
      <p>Globalia said Thursday the pilot keyed in the code by mistake as the plane bound for Madrid was preparing for takeoff Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The alert triggered a big security operation at the airport. No one was injured.</p>
      <p>The company said in a statement Wednesday that the passengers informed by the crew that it had been a false alarm.</p>
      <p>The airline tweeted at the time: "Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologize."</p>
      <p>Globalia said Thursday it considered the matter finished and no disciplinary action would be taken.</p>
