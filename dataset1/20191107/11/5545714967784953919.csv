07 Nov 2019, 11:30 by Chris Carter
The big one today is Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy Deluxe Edition, a Switch port of a mobile game that continued the Layton tale with his daughter in charge. The Switch is getting a few more heavy-hitters this week like New Super Lucky's Tale, as well as Disney Tsum Tsum Festival.

No 3DS or Wii U offerings again this week! But there is a ton of Switch stuff, keeping in line with Nintendo's wishes. Scroll through the Switch eShop sometime: it's insane just how bloated it's become, allowing sales like this to exist just to be noticed.
If you missed last week's edition, here it is. For those who are interested, sales are going on for all platforms.
