Vingroup begins making smart televisions - VnExpress International
07 Nov 2019, 11:20 by VnExpress
The smart TVs are currently being manufactured in a factory in Hanoi's Hoa Lac Industrial Park, and are set to be released around December this year, according to a Vingroup source who wished to remain anonymous.
They will run on the Android TV operating system, which is currently being used by smart TVs produced by Japanese electronics-maker Sony, according to information leaked on tech forums on Wednesday.
Users will be able to install applications from the Google Play Store, as well as issue voice commands in Vietnamese.  
The new smart TV has garnered thousands of comments on internet forums, many of which said it should be affordable so that it can compete with existing products of Sony and South Korean electronics-maker LG.
VinSmart was established by Vingroup in June 2018, and produced its first smartphones just six months after. It has produced a total of eight models thus far. Last month, the company began selling four of its Vsmart models in Russia.
