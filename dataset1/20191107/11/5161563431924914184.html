      <p>VICTORIA -- It's been a long time coming – about 67 million years, in fact – but British Columbia finally has a dinosaur to call its very own.</p>
      <p>The fossilized bones of the <i>Ferrisaurus sustutensis</i>, or the "iron lizard from the Sustut River,” have actually been right under researchers' noses for years but weren't correctly identified until now.</p>
      <p>The handful of bones belonging to the Triceratops-like specimen were discovered in 1971 by a geologist near the Sustut River in B.C.'s north-central Interior.</p>
      <p>The fossils were eventually donated to Dalhousie University in 2005 before winding up in the Royal BC Museum in 2007.</p>
      <p>Victoria Arbour, curator of paleontology at the museum, has been studying the fossils and has now determined they belong to a whole new kind of dinosaur.</p>
      <p>"B.C. isn’t a place that's super well-known for dinosaur fossils," Arbour told CTV News.</p>
      <p>"We actually have a really good fossil record, we just haven’t found a lot of dinosaur specimens yet. So this being a unique species found only in British Columbia, so far, is pretty exciting."</p>
      <p>The <i>Ferrisaurus sustutensis</i> resembled its larger cousin, the Triceratops, but lacked horns.</p>
      <p>The dinosaur had a parrot-like beak, ate only plants, and measured about 1.75 metres in length and 150 kilograms (330 pounds) in weight, according to Ardour's research published Thursday in the scientific journal <i><a href="https://peerj.com/">PeerJ: The Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences</a>.</i></p>
      <p>"For the first time, we've got a set of dinosaur bones from British Columbia that's unique to this province," Arbour said.</p>
      <p>The fossilized remains have been given the nickname "Buster," and are now on display at the Victoria museum.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Arbour led an expedition to the Sustut River region where the bones were first discovered, and found fossilized plants and parts of a turtle from the same era, which are now part of the museum's collection.</p>
      <p>“This is an exciting scientific milestone for our province and I encourage everyone to come see the fossils for themselves," said B.C.'s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Lisa Beare.</p>
      <p>Arbour’s peer-reviewed article, “A new leptoceratopsid dinosaur from Maastrichtian-aged deposits of the Sustut Basin, northern British Columbia, Canada,” was co-authored by David Evans from the Royal Ontario Museum.</p>
