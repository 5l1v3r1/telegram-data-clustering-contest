        <b>Glasgow has been listed as the top cultural and creative centre in the UK in a report from the European Commission.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following in the top five were London, Bristol, Brighton and Manchester, with Edinburgh just missing out in sixth place.</p>
      <p>Dundee was the next Scottish city to be ranked, coming in 12th.</p>
      <p>Glasgow came first for "openness, tolerance and trust" and "cultural participation and attractiveness".</p>
      <p>The study<a href="https://composite-indicators.jrc.ec.europa.eu/cultural-creative-cities-monitor/cultural-creative-cities/docs-and-data"> ranks 190 cities in 30 European countries on various factors.</a></p>

      <p>"Cultural vibrancy", "creative economy", and the ability to bring in creative talent and nourish cultural engagement were all taken into account.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh came first for cultural venues and facilities in the UK.</p>
      <p>The report said: "Glasgow was one of the first European capitals of culture, in 1990. Known as an industrial city, it has now gained recognition as a creative and cultural centre of European importance."</p>

      <p>Glasgow boasts over 100 cultural organisations and is home to five of Scotland's six national performing arts companies: the Royal Scottish National Orchestra; National Theatre of Scotland; BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra; Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet.</p>
      <p>The council said that Glasgow's museums have more visitors than in any UK city outside London.</p>
      <p>Eight Turner Prize winners have been born, trained or worked out of Glasgow in recent years, and the city's Tramway hosted the event in 2015.</p>

      <p>Bridget McConnell from Glasgow Life, the organisation that delivers cultural and sports events for Glasgow City Council, said: "We always knew Glasgow was a global cultural leader and we're delighted that the European Commission has confirmed our position of the UK's leading cultural and creative city.</p>
      <p>"Glasgow is a city bursting with energy, passion and creativity and filled with artists, designers, creators and innovators.</p>
      <p>"We have world-class museums and galleries, incredible architecture and history and, as a Unesco City of Music, there's nowhere better to enjoy a gig.</p>
      <p>"What's more, our openness, tolerance and trust has been rated as the best in Europe, confirming what we already know, that our people make Glasgow the best city in the world."</p>
