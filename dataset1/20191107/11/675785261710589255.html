      <h2>Emily Harvey was hit with a baseball bat, frying pan and vacuum cleaner pipe before being strangled at the 17-year-old boy's home in Loughborough</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:18:19+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Troughton, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>A teenager was beaten with a baseball bat until it broke then strangled by a boy she met on a dating app.</p>
      <p>Emily Harvey, 19, was lured to the boy's flat where he hit her with the bat, before grabbing a frying pan to continue his violent onslaught.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old attacker, from Loughborough, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also used a vacuum cleaner pipe as a weapon and went on to strangle Ms Harvey until she passed out, <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/this-it-hes-going-kill-3506743">Leicestershire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Leicester Crown Court heard that during the prolonged and sadistic attack, he took sick photographs of Emily, terrified and cowering on his settee, and shared them with a friend and his half-brother.</p>
      <p>Emily said she managed to escape his evil clutches after she woke up - before he accused her of stabbing him.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Realising what happened, she fled the flat and ran into the arms of a neighbour who called the police.</p>
      <p>Recalling her ordeal, Emily said: “He had beaten me with a baseball bat, and when he broke that on me, he got a frying pan and hit me on the back of the head with it, then picked up a Hoover pipe and started to rain blows on me with that."</p>
      <p>When her attacker started to strangle her she said she could feel herself passing out.</p>
      <p>“At that moment, I thought, ‘This is it. He’s going to kill me’," she said. "Then it all went black.”</p>
      <p>Emily had no idea how long she had lost consciousness but when she came around and he accused her of stabbing him she feared he would kill her.</p>
      <p>She said: "He screamed at me for attacking him and told me to get out.</p>
      <p>“I managed to get to my feet and I ran as fast as I could out of the door.</p>
      <p>“As I tried to get out of the building I bumped into one of his neighbours. She took me in and called the police.”</p>
      <p>Emily's traumatic ordeal had lasted a total of six hours.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She had met her attacker through the dating app Badoo where they laughed and joked before she agreed to go to his flat.</p>
      <p>“We got chatting and he seemed really nice," she said.</p>
      <p>"He was funny and said he liked me. We chatted for about a month. We sent messages on Snapchat too.</p>
      <p>“He asked me to go over to meet him and said he would pay for the taxi.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I sort of knew him, so I agreed to go. At first he was lovely. It was fun. Then he just changed.</p>
      <p>"He damaged my phone so I couldn't contact anyone. Then he attacked me.</p>
      <p>“One minute he was okay with me, then he just flipped.</p>
      <p>"He attacked me for no reason. I really thought he was going to kill me there in his flat."</p>

      <p>Last month he was sentenced to five years in detention and four on licence. </p>
      <p>Emily said: “I don’t think that is justice after what he did to me.</p>
      <p>“They should lock him away and never let him out."</p>
      <p>Today, Emily is slowly trying to find some normality in her life in the wake of the attack.</p>
      <p>“The biggest problem I've got physically is the ligament in my right hand,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It got badly damaged as I tried to fend off the blows as he hit me, and kept on hitting me, with the baseball bat until it broke on me.</p>
      <p>“I can’t do much for another couple of months.</p>
      <p>"I hope that it will heal and then I can start to look for a job.”</p>
      <p>Emily has been offered counselling, but said she felt she did not need it.</p>
      <p>“I want to just get on with things,” she said. "I haven’t had any nightmares about this, which is good.</p>

      <p>“I've been out a couple of times with friends and that helps.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel like I can trust anyone I don’t know properly now."</p>
      <p>She added: "I’m not sure how I might feel about meeting another man and going on a date – that’s so far off in the future I can’t even think about it."</p>
      <p>Emily's father Richard Harvey said: “My daughter used to be so outgoing, so full of life,” he said.</p>
      <p>“She was just a normal 19-year-old. Going out with her friends, having fun. So bright, so lovely.</p>
      <p>“Now she spend so much time in her bedroom. She rarely goes out.</p>
      <p>“The physical scars will heal, but I'm not so sure that the mental ones will.</p>
      <p>“I think she may be forever looking over her shoulder, worrying that something like this might happen again.”</p>
