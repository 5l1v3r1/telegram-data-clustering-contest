      <p>After a turbulent and not-especially-productive run on RCA Records — or at least productive in the years after she released her great 2014 debut <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1710329/album-of-the-week-tinashe-aquarius/franchises/album-of-the-week/">Aquarius</a></i> — the LA R&amp;B queen Tinashe is now on her own, getting ready to release a new independent album called <i>Songs For You</i>. A couple of weeks ago, she dropped a video for “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062651/tinashe-die-a-little-bit-feat-ms-banks-video/video/">Die A Little Bit</a>,” a sharp, slinky, clubby track that features the UK rapper Ms Banks. Today, she’s come out with another single, a more traditional R&amp;B number that features the Atlanta singer 6LACK.</p>
      <p>Sadly, “Touch &amp; Go” is not an ode to the long-running Midwestern indie label that put out all those Butthole Surfers and Jesus Lizard records. Instead, it’s a slow and emotional just-before-the-breakup song, with both Tinashe and 6LACK playing two people who are trying to figure out whether to keep their relationship together.

      <p>And speaking of 6LACK, he’s the guest on the latest episode of producer Kenny Beats’ great YouTube series <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2054626/kenny-beats-the-cave-youtube-show/franchises/status-aint-hood/">The Cave</a></i>. He raps, too! 6LACK is quiet and undemonstrative for most of the episode. But when Kenny finishes the beat — 6LACK specifically requests something that sounds like 1997 New York — 6LACK goes extremely hard and pile on the <i>Cave</i> inside jokes. Here’s that episode:</p>
