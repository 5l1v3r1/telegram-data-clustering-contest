智利抗議者疑遭警虐殺：19天已累計145起酷刑、17起性虐待訴訟
07 Nov 2019, 11:20 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是智利爆發的抗議活動示威者主要是30歲以下的新生代，專家認為他們「寧為玉碎，不為瓦全」，訴求很容易發展成暴力。



智利10月爆發近年來最嚴重的社會動亂，造成上千人受傷、有更多的人被拘捕，智利警方也遭控在過去9年來，前所未有的虐待、性侵和殺害示威者。不過智利總統皮涅拉今（7）日表示，他的政府無所隱瞞，並將以制裁動亂人士的相同力道，追究違反人權的軍警。
智利今年宣布調漲地鐵票價，結果引發全民不滿，百萬人上街要求經濟改革、總統下台，是智利有史以來最大規模的示威。雖然智利總統皮涅拉（Sebastian Pinera）承諾將重組內閣，但仍無法澆熄民眾的怒火，堅持要總統下台，抗議蔓延至全國，也引爆嚴重的警民衝突。

《路透社》報導，有關當局與人權團體指出，抗議爆發至今（7）日，已有至少23人死亡、7000多人遭拘留，並有1659名示威者和800名警員受傷。
此外，智利檢方正在調查800多起安全部隊施虐指控，包括對示威者動用酷刑、性侵或毆打。檢方表示，有5名抗議人士疑似死於安全部隊之手。

警察涉酷刑、性虐待，19天數量直逼過去9年
聖地牙哥東區檢察官蓋拉（Manuel Guerra）今天說，他將尋求法院批准對14名疑似酷刑對待示威者的警察展開調查。他鎖定2起事件，都發生在聖地牙哥10月18日進入緊急狀態後的9天內。
《半島電視台》報導，14名警察受到調查是個好兆頭，不過他們相信，濫用職權的警察預期將更多。智利人權委員會正針對120多名警察進行調查，也希望智利當局能繼續深入調查。
智利人權委員會（INDH）指出，過去9年來，智利國家人權研究所（NHRI）一共針對319起警察使用酷刑、33起警察涉性虐待提出訴訟，而其中分別有145起酷刑、17起性虐待，是在過去19天提出。
聯合國人權使節團「泛美人權委員會」（Inter-American Commission on Human Rights）也正在調查智利警方在示威期間虐待民眾的指控。他們在人權團體請求下，今天要求皮涅拉批准使節團派員進入智利。
不過，智利總統皮涅拉（Sebastian Pinera）今天則在總統府莫內達宮（Palacio La Moneda）發表演說，表示：「我們一直對（死傷）人數完全透明，因為我們沒什麼好隱瞞。」他還承諾，警察和軍人若違反人權被判有罪，將受到和暴徒及搶劫犯相同力道懲罰。
《BBC》採訪當地一名15歲的示威者Matias Vera Valdivia，他曾被橡膠子彈擊中6次，其中1次導致他失去視力，他將進行手術希望能恢復視力。「總統在撒謊」，他表示，「人們在和平地遊行，但警察是壞人，他們因為少數人的行為，牽連了所有人。」

「寧為玉碎，不為瓦全」智利示威者多為30歲以下
《中央社》報導，聖地牙哥大學政治分析家達梅爾特（Lucia Dammert）指出，智利爆發的抗議活動是一個已經孕育了很長時間的現象，示威者主要是30歲以下的新生代，未經歷過獨裁政府，敢怒敢言，寧為玉碎，不為瓦全，所以他們的抗議訴求很容易發展成暴力。
另一方面，包括皮涅拉和反對派在內的智利政治和經濟菁英不願正視民眾的訴求，面對社會動亂的反應冷漠，一味派軍隊以武力鎮壓，統治者變成民主重建的障礙，結果令不容忍現象和暴力加劇。
安地斯大學政治學教授曼蘇伊（Daniel Mansuy）指出，這場危機之所以如此持久，是因為一般統治階級，尤其是政治階層，尚未能夠闡明、遏制或為社會弊病指明方向，而人民覺得不能依靠政府機關。
智利政治專欄作家卡瓦洛（Ascanio Cavallo）認為，皮涅拉政府已經「象徵性的玩完了」，尤其是上週宣布取消主辦亞太經濟合作會議高峰會（APEC）以及聯合國氣候變化綱要公約第25次締約方大會（Cop 25）後。因為這是皮涅拉政府在國際事務中取得的最大成就。
儘管國內示威活動持續，民意支持度下滑至14%，皮涅拉堅稱他不會辭職下台，但表示可能通過國會修憲，修正民營化積累的社會財富和社會不公之間的矛盾。
報導指出，智利的生活成本高昂，尤其是首都聖地牙哥，過去10年房價上漲150%，但工資只漲25%。智利雖為經濟合作暨發展組織（OECD）成員國，70%的人口月入不到770美元，超過60%的人口債務纏身。

Chilean protesters suspected of being killed by police: 19 days have accumulated 145 tortures and 17 sexual abuse suits
07 Nov 2019, 11:20 by Abby Huang


What we want you to know is that the protesters in Chile broke out mainly in the new generation under the age of 30. Experts believe that they ""are rather jade, not complete,"" and the appeal is easy to develop into violence.



Chile’s most serious social unrest in recent years in October caused thousands of injuries and more people to be arrested. The Chilean police have also been accused of ill-treatment, sexual assault and killing of demonstrators in the past nine years. However, Chilean President Piñera said today (7) that his government has no concealment and will use the same force of sanctioning the unrest to pursue military and police violations of human rights.
Chile announced this year that it will raise the price of subways. The result is dissatisfaction among the whole people. Millions of people are on the streets demanding economic reforms and the president is stepping down. This is the largest demonstration in Chile's history. Although Chilean President Sebastian Pinera promised to reorganize the cabinet, it still could not quench the anger of the people, insisted that the president step down, protests spread to the whole country, and also detonated serious police and civilian conflicts.


The biggest demonstration in Chile’s history, millions of people took to the streets: the president disbanded the cabinet, and even the APEC summit was cancelled.


Reuters reported that authorities and human rights groups have pointed out that at the end of the protests (7), at least 23 people have been killed, more than 7,000 have been detained, and 1,659 demonstrators and 800 police officers have been injured.
In addition, Chilean prosecutors are investigating more than 800 allegations of torture by security forces, including torture, sexual assault or beatings against demonstrators. The prosecution said that five protesters were suspected of dying from the hands of the security forces.

The police involved in torture and sexual abuse, and the number of 19 days was almost the same as the past 9 years.
San Diego’s Eastern District Attorney, Manuel Guerra, said today that he would seek court approval to investigate 14 suspected torture police officers. He locked in two incidents, all within nine days after San Diego entered the state of emergency on October 18.
Al Jazeera reported that 14 police officers were surveyed, which bodes well, but they believe that the police who abuse their powers are expected to be more. The Chilean Human Rights Commission is conducting an investigation into more than 120 police officers and hopes that the Chilean authorities will continue to conduct in-depth investigations.
The Chilean Human Rights Commission (INDH) pointed out that over the past nine years, the National Institute of Human Rights (NHRI) has filed a lawsuit against 319 police officers and 33 police-related sexual abuses, including 145 tortures and 17 sexual abuses. It was presented in the past 19 days.
The United Nations Human Rights Envoy, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, is also investigating allegations of Palestinian police abuse during the demonstrations. At the request of the human rights group, they asked Piniella to approve the envoys to enter Chile.
However, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera gave a speech at the Palacio La Moneda in the presidential palace today, saying: ""We have always been completely transparent about the number of (deadly injured), because we have nothing to hide."" Commitment, if police and military personnel are found guilty of violating human rights, they will be punished with the same force as the mob and the robber.
The BBC interviewed a local 15-year-old demonstrator, Matias Vera Valdivia, who was hit six times by rubber bullets, one of which caused him to lose sight. He will undergo surgery to restore sight. ""The president is lying,"" he said. ""People are marching peacefully, but the police are bad people. They are implicating everyone because of the actions of a few people.""

""It’s better to be jade, not to be full."" Chilean demonstrators are mostly under 30 years old.
""Central News"" reported that Lucia Dammert, a political analyst at the University of San Diego, pointed out that the protests in Chile were a phenomenon that had been bred for a long time. The demonstrators were mainly new generations under the age of 30 and had not experienced After the dictatorship of the government, they dare to speak out, they are rather jade, not for the sake of the whole, so their protest appeals can easily develop into violence.
On the other hand, Chilean political and economic elites, including Piniella and the opposition, are reluctant to face the demands of the people, face the indifference of social unrest, and force the army to suppress by force, and the rulers become obstacles to democratic reconstruction. As a result, intolerance and violence have intensified.
Daniel Mansuy, a professor of political science at the University of the Andes, points out that the crisis is so long-lasting because the general ruling class, especially the political class, has not been able to clarify, contain or point the way for social ills, and the people feel Can not rely on government agencies.
Chilean political columnist Ascanio Cavallo believes that the Piniella government has ""successfully finished playing"", especially last week announced the cancellation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC) and the UN Climate Change Framework Convention 25 After the Conference of the Parties (Cop 25). Because this is the greatest achievement of the Pinella government in international affairs.
Although domestic demonstrations continued and public opinion support fell to 14%, Pinera insisted that he would not resign, but said that it is possible to amend the constitution to amend the contradiction between social wealth and social injustice accumulated by privatization.
The report pointed out that the cost of living in Chile is high, especially in the capital city of San Diego. In the past 10 years, house prices have risen by 150%, but wages have only increased by 25%. Although Chile is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 70% of the population has a monthly income of less than $770, and more than 60% of the population is in debt.
