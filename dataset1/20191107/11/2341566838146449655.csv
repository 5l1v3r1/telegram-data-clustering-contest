首里城大火疑肇因電氣設備 白澤之圖逃過火劫

（中央社東京7日綜合外電報導）日本沖繩首里城大火屆滿一週，消防單位研判電氣系統設備出問題可能是起火原因。目前已知館藏文物「白澤之圖」等逾千件逃過火劫，但另外逾400件文物很可能已被燒毀。
日本時事通信社報導，那霸市消防局研判火災原因很可能是電氣系統設備出問題，仍持續跟沖繩縣警方進行火場調查。
目前受損情況逐漸明朗，正殿地下的世界遺產可能稍微受損，另外過去花了約73億日圓重建的7棟建物及逾400件收藏文物皆被燒毀，目前難以預料何時能完成重建。
這場大火是在10月31日清晨發生，保全人員在得知警報啟動後趕往現場，發現已濃煙密布；保全人員請求支援再返回火場時，配電箱所在的正殿一樓東北側窗戶冒出濃煙，此時火勢已達無法撲滅狀態。
消防等單位研判，起火點很可能就是正殿北側。沖繩縣警方與消防人員已找到看似配電箱的物體，從本月5日起詳細調查是否有短路等情況；沖繩縣政府等單位表示，過去並未發生漏電等異常情況。
受沖繩縣委託管理與營運首里城的財團法人「沖繩美麗之島」，昨天也更正事發前一天晚上保全人員最後巡視的時間。保全人員在事發前約5小時進入正殿內巡邏，事發前一小時僅從正殿對面的奉神門進行確認，管理公司等單位也將檢討管理體制是否有疏失。
位於正殿地下的遺跡登錄為世界遺產，目前已知在方便民眾參觀而設置的透明玻璃處發現瓦礫，表示可能有部分損傷；但由於大多數遺跡都被土覆蓋，預料不致受損。
沖繩美麗之島表示，館藏中總計約有1100件逃過火劫，包括沖繩縣政府指定為文化財的「白澤之圖」等3件，但琉球王朝時代的繪畫「雪中花鳥圖」等約400件文物，很可能已付之一炬。
另外存放庫房內的「黑漆菊花鳥蟲七寶繫沈金食籠」、「黑漆牡丹七寶繫沈金食籠」雖未見燒傷痕跡，但因為受到漏水影響，有可能受熱產生變化。
根據日媒拍攝的火場照片，木造正殿已全數燒毀，僅剩殿前基座上2根雕成龍形的石柱殘存。
這次燒毀的正殿是在1992年重建完成，日本內閣府表示，正殿內需使用到的約百根檜木目前已難尋，加上需要藉由專門職人（工匠）高超手藝，目前要估算重建預算及訂定重建時程表，顯有困難。
日本產經新聞報導，那霸市消防局表示，首里城大火原因很可能跟正殿電氣系統有關。相關人士表示，目前已在正殿東北側周邊配線發現多處疑似短路痕跡，正在調查跟火災的關聯性。（譯者：黃名璽/核稿：張曉雯）1081107

Shuri Castle fire suspected because of electrical equipment Bai Zezhi escaped the fire robbery
07 Nov 2019, 11:43 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th, comprehensive foreign news report) Japan's Okinawa Shuri Castle fire expired a week, the fire unit to study the electrical system equipment problems may be the cause of fire. At present, more than a thousand pieces of the cultural relics such as the ""Bai Ze Zhi"" have been escaped from the fire, but more than 400 other cultural relics are likely to have been burned.
Japan's current affairs news agency reported that the Naha City Fire Bureau has determined that the cause of the fire is likely to be a problem with the electrical system equipment, and continues to conduct fire investigations with the Okinawa police.
At present, the damage is gradually becoming clear. The world heritage in the main hall may be slightly damaged. In addition, 7 buildings and more than 400 pieces of cultural relics that have been rebuilt in the past 730 million yen have been burned. It is difficult to predict when reconstruction will be completed.
The fire broke out on the early morning of October 31. The security personnel rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm started, and found that the smoke was densely covered. When the security personnel requested support and returned to the fire, the northeast side window of the first floor of the main hall where the distribution box was located Smoke is emitted, and the fire has reached a state where it cannot be extinguished.
The fire and other units have judged that the fire point is likely to be the north side of the main hall. Okinawa police and firefighters have found objects that appear to be distribution boxes. From the 5th of this month, they will investigate in detail whether there is a short circuit or not. The Okinawa Prefecture Government and other units said that there have been no abnormalities such as leakage in the past.
Okinawa Prefecture was commissioned to manage and operate the ""Okinawa Beautiful Island"", a consortium of Shuri Castle. Yesterday, it was also corrected the time of the last inspection of the security personnel the night before the incident. The security personnel patrolled the main hall about 5 hours before the incident. Only one hour before the incident, the company was confirmed from the Fengshen Gate opposite the main hall. The management company and other units will also review whether the management system is negligent.
The remains on the ground floor of the main hall are registered as World Heritage Sites. It is known that rubble is found in the transparent glass set up for the convenience of the public, indicating that there may be some damage; but since most of the remains are covered by soil, it is not expected to be damaged.
Okinawa’s beautiful island says that there are about 1,100 escaped fires in the collection, including three such as the “Bai Ze Zhi” designated by the Okinawa Prefecture Government for cultural wealth, but about 400 paintings such as the “Snow and Birds” in the Ryukyu Dynasty era. A piece of cultural relics is likely to have been paid.
In addition, the ""black lacquer chrysanthemum bird seven treasures Shenjin food cage"" and ""black lacquer peony seven treasures Shenjin food cage"" stored in the warehouse have not seen burn marks, but they may be affected by heat due to water leakage.
According to the photos of the fire scene taken by the Japanese media, the main hall of the wooden building has been completely burned, leaving only two stone pillars carved into a dragon shape on the pedestal in front of the temple.
The main hall of the burnt was completed in 1992. The Cabinet Office of Japan said that about 100 cedar trees in the main hall are hard to find. In addition, it is necessary to use the skilled workers (artisans) to superb craftsmanship. It is difficult to reconstruct the schedule.
Japan’s Sankei Shimbun reported that the Naha City Fire Department said that the cause of the Shuri Castle fire is likely to be related to the main hall electrical system. According to relevant sources, many suspected short-circuit traces have been found in the wiring around the northeast side of the main hall, and the correlation with the fire is being investigated.
