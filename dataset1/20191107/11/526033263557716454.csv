The unknown gunman fired multiple shots from a red Pontiac G6, police said Thursday. The suspect or suspects then fled in the car, said police.

The boy, who was rushed to a children's hospital, was still in critical condition on Thursday, police said.

Police gather at the scene where a 10-year-old boy was shot in the back of the head in Philadelphia, Nov. 6, 2019.

This shooting comes just weeks after a 2-year-old girl, Nikolette Rivera, was in the shot dead in her North Philadelphia home on a Sunday afternoon.
Nikolette was in her mother's arms when bullets from an automatic rifle came through the wall and hit her in the head.
One day before Nikolette was killed, an 11-month-old boy, Yazeem Jenkins, was shot four times and critically injured while in the back of a car in Philadelphia's Hunting Park neighborhood.
""Yazeem is fighting for his life at Children’s Hospital,"" William McSwain, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, said Monday.
After those two shootings, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said weapons are ""flowing"" into the city ""like a river.""
""Outraged, disgusted, and heartbroken by the violence this weekend that claimed the life of an innocent 2-year-old and left another infant fighting for his life,"" Kenney tweeted. ""Philadelphians should not live in fear of violence that could take away a child’s life.""
