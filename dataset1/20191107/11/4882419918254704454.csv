Bayern Munich's search for a new manager has led them to former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger after they sacked Niko Kovac this week.
Wenger, 70, has emerged as the top candidate after the Germans saw their advances for various other coaches turned down.
A move for the French coach is seen as a short-term solution to fix the problems they have had this season and which led to the dismissal of Kovac.
The idea is to offer Wenger a contract until the end of the season with the objective of then appointing a younger coach next summer to lead their project for the coming years.
According to Bild, the details of the contract will be negotiated in the coming days, although there has already been a phone call between Wenger and Bayern's CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.
Bayern want a new man in place before Nov. 15 with the aim of him then being able to take charge after the international break.
Before Wenger, Thomas Tuchel (PSG), Ralf Rangnick (ex-Leipzig) and Erik ten Hag (Ajax) had all been linked, but none of them were prepared to take the job on at this stage of the season.
