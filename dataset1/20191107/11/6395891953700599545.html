      <p><b>SRINAGAR, IndiaÂ (AP)</b> - Heavy snowfall killed at least three people in Himalayan Kashmir on Thursday, leaving the region paralyzed, officials said.</p>
      <p>Deep snow blocked some roads and damaged power lines, disrupting life in the disputed region.</p>
      <p>Civil administrator Baser Khan said two porters working with the Indian army slipped into a deep gorge in frontier Kupwara bordering Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.</p>
      <p>He said efforts were underway to retrieve their bodies.</p>
      <p>Another man working with the electricity department died in Srinagar, the region's main city while trying to restore power supplies, which have been disrupted. He fell off a pole, dying on the spot, officials said.</p>
      <p>The snow caused large scale damage to apple trees, the mainstay of the region's economy.</p>
      <p>Roads were treacherous and mostly empty.</p>
      <p>While the snowfall was moderate in the plains of Kashmir, heavy snowfall at higher elevations disrupted flights.</p>
      <p>An official of the airport authority of India said all incoming and outgoing flights at Srinagar airport were canceled Thursday.</p>
      <p>Weather forecasts called for moderate to heavy snowfall and rains in the region.</p>
      <p>"The snowfall will continue till Friday morning," said weatherman Sonam Lotus.</p>
