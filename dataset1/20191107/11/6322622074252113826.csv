China and the United States agree to cancel tariffs
07 Nov 2019, 11:15 by Justin Lim
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug. 7): The Malaysian stock market rose 6.08 points or 0.38% to close at the all-day high as China and the United States agreed to phase out the increase in tariffs.
In addition, the optimism of Sino-US trade has driven the ringgit to strengthen with the renminbi.
The FTSE KLCI fell to 1601.18 points in intraday trading. It was led by Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd, and closed at 1609.33 points.
The Malaysian stock market has the same trend as Hong Kong. Reuters reported that the Hong Kong stock market closed higher on Thursday, as signs of progress in China-US trade negotiations resurfaced, triggering a wave of gains in the 30 minutes before the close.
At the close, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.6% to 27,847.23. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.7% to 10,935.89.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that China and the United States agreed to cancel the tariff increase in stages with the progress of the agreement.
CNBC reported that the new hope for the first phase of the trade agreement prompted US stock index futures to rise earlier Thursday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open more than 120 points.
Liu Songzeng, vice president of Rakuten Trading Research, told theedgemarkets.com that the market’s optimism about Sino-US trade negotiations has pushed the KLCI up.
He said that Lotte expects these optimism to continue to push up the KLCI.
Lee Siao Ping, research and technology analyst at Public Investment Bank, pointed out that from a technical point of view, if the KLCI remains above the 1600 level tomorrow, this means that the KLCI will have a “long reversal” in the short term.
“The support levels are visible at 1600 and 1580. The resistance levels are 1622 and 1636.”
The Malaysian stock market had 2.6 billion shares and a total value of RM1.895 billion.
Major upholds include Kuala Lumpur's Kepong and Hong Leong Financial Group. KL in Kuala Lumpur rose 60 sen or 2.69% to RM22.92, and Hong Leong Financial rose 28 sen or 1.63%, hung at 17.48 ringgit.
In the foreign exchange market, the ringgit exchange rate against the US dollar rose to 4.1240 as the yuan appreciated against the dollar.
Reuters reported that onshore and offshore RMB regained the 7-yuan mark on Thursday, as the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that both China and the United States have agreed to cancel tariffs imposed in phases over several months of trade war.
The report pointed out that the onshore RMB once rose to 6.9840, the highest since August 2. 0752GMT reported 6.9908, while the offshore RMB was 6.9924.
