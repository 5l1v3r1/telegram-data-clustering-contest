      <p>The Green Party has announced it will not be standing candidates in any of Belfast's four consitituencies in next month's general election.</p>
      <p>After <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/06/news/clare-bailey-says-backing-claire-hanna-is-taking-action-needed-to-reject-brexit--1757341/">previously standing aside in south Belfast</a> and backing the SLP's Claire Hanna, leader Clare Bailey said this morning that there will be no Green Party candidates in any of Belfast's other three constituencies.</p>
      <p>“This election is all about returning as many pro-Remain MPs as possible," she said.</p>
      <p>“These are extraordinary times and require an extraordinary response.</p>
      <p>“The Green Party NI achieved our best ever vote across the city of Belfast in the local government election earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“However, I’m prepared to put the need to have pro-Remain MPs returned ahead of party interest. </p>
      <p>The Green Party move is the latest in a series of announcements by parties lending support to rivals.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Sinn Féin <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/04/news/sinn-fe-in-will-not-contest-election-in-three-seats-1756091/">said it will not contest South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down</a> in order to back other pro-Remain candidates.</p>
      <p>The SDLP <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/04/news/sdlp-to-give-sinn-fe-in-s-john-finucane-a-free-run-in-north-belfast-1755288/">said it will not run candidates in North Belfast, East Belfast or North Down</a>, and asked its supporters to vote for other pro-Remain candidates in the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, unionists are also preparing to stand aside to support rivals.</p>
      <p>DUP leader Arlene Foster <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/04/news/uup-pull-out-of-north-belfast-as-unionist-pact-to-go-ahead-in-fermanagh-south-tyrone-1755337/">announced that her party would not run in Fermanagh and South Tyrone</a>, and would instead back former Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott in a bid to unseat Sinn Fein's Michelle Gildernew.</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott has declined to say whether he intends to run.</p>
      <p>Incoming UUP leader Steve Aiken had previously indicated that his party would stand in all 18 constituencies in the north.</p>
      <p>But in a U-turn over the weekend. he announced that the UUP will not field a candidate in North Belfast, where DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds is expected to come under pressure from Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane.</p>
