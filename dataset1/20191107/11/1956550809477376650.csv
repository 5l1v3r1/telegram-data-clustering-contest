Blue Marlin Ibiza UAE is no doubt one of the coolest places to party.
If you love dancing on a beach (who doesn’t?), it’s one of the best places to be at the weekend, but on Friday November 22 it is putting on something extra special.
The Hob Festival is set to feature sets from a long list of brilliant DJs including Bahramji & Medusa Odyssey, Frederick Stone, Habibi Funk, Hoolz, Layla Kardan and many more big names.
But that’s not all.
You can also start your day at the beach bar by joining in with the pop-up brunch, and enjoy making all your Instagram followers very jealous as you relax on a sunbed and feast on tasty bites from 1pm to 4pm.
Or, if you want to burn off a few calories before you start partying there will be a yoga class held at 10.30am and a dance class at noon.
We’ll see you on the dancefloor.Dhs84 (entry), Dhs350 (brunch). Fri Nov 22 10.30am onwards. Golden Tulip Al Jazira Hotels and Resort, Ghantoot (056 113 3400).
