      <p>Former Smiths musician Johnny Marr appeared to quash rumours that he and Morrissey could be set to reunite as he joked Nigel Farage could join the band to play guitar.</p>
      <p>Marr, who played guitar in the influential band, was responding to speculation on a Morrissey fan forum that a reunion tour for the Smiths was "closer than ever to becoming a reality".</p>
      <p>Asked directly by a fan about the rumours on Twitter, Marr responded: "Nigel Farage on guitar."</p>

      <p>Marr appeared to be making a reference to Morrissey's increasingly strident political statements, which have seen him support Brexit Party leader Mr Farage and more recently the far-right party For Britain.</p>
      <p>Rumours of a reunion have been near constant since Marr left the band in 1987, but he and Morrissey have repeatedly said they have little interest.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Marr, who once tweeted to "forbid" David Cameron to like the Smiths, said in an interview with Sky News in 2016 that Morrissey's pro-Farage views would also be "a slight drawback" to any possibly reunion.</p>
      <p>Morrissey hit the headlines again last month when he performed at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles wearing a vest which bore the slogan "f*** the Guardian", as he claims the newspaper is running an "inexhaustible hate campaign" against him.</p>
