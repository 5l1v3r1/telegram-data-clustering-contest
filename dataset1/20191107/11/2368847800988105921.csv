孝子遭非法關押三月餘 九旬老母含冤離世

07 Nov 2019, 11:58

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】陝西省岐山縣法輪功學員沈紅奇，被國保大隊和派出所從他在縣城經營的家電修理服務部綁架，非法關押至今已三月有餘。
明慧網報導，近日，構陷沈紅奇的所謂「案子」已到岐山縣檢察院。
2019年7月22日，沈宏奇被岐山縣國保大隊夥同鳳鳴派出所、麥和營派出所警察，綁架到岐山縣星期五賓館，被上刑具，坐「鐵椅子」四天四夜，並非法刑事拘留，目前被關押在岐山縣看守所。
沈紅奇被關押迫害後，家人一直瞞著他母親，告訴老人兒子外出打工，老人精神狀態一直很好。最近老人知道了兒子的遭遇，特別傷心，要求親自去要回兒子。家人勸說阻止說，她年紀太大 ，折騰不起。
老人整天見人就哭著述說兒子有多麼孝順，多麼聽話，多麼心靈手巧，「我兒子這好那好，那些人關押好人不是在造罪嗎……」
有兒不能養老盡孝送終，老人終究承受不了打擊，最近整天整夜不睡覺，突然出現腦梗，臥床不起，在醫院搶救無效，含冤離世。家人悲痛至極。
沈紅奇（沈宏奇）1997年開始學法輪功，身心發生了很大的變化，上學時得的胃病徹底好了；他正直善良，樂於助人、特別孝敬父母。
沈紅奇父親活到90歲，靠吸氧機活了五六年。一次，沈紅奇去醫院買回一次性氧氣袋，供父親吸氧，可他村子停電，供不上，就又拉著吸氧機和父親去親戚家插電供氧。村子裡的人都羨慕老人有這樣孝順的兒子，若別家老人這樣可能早去世了。
沈紅奇學法輪功後做人按真善忍要求自己，認真對待每一件事，遇事先考慮別人。
在他女兒上大學期間，國家對貧困學生有助學補助款，名額有限，老師就每年輪流發放。有一年輪到他家孩子了，孩子已買好了車票回家辦手續，後來他聽說女兒同班有一個孩子家庭困難，更需要這三千元，就告訴女兒退了車票回學校，讓給那同學了。
沈紅奇修煉法輪功初期，那時家家戶戶都養豬增加收入，他家養了兩頭大豬。當時村子豬瘟流行，不法商販在村子裡收豬時連病豬都會一二百元廉價收走，他家也有一頭大豬病了，那些人在他家去了幾趟要求賣給他們，他說什麼都不賣，寧願扔了也不干那些損人利己的缺德事。豬販子很感動，說以後有時間想好好了解法輪功。
此事在村子被傳為佳話，因為當時的一二百元也不是一個小數目，小工一天才十元錢。
三十年來，沈紅奇上門給方圓幾十里的人服務維修電器，不坑不騙，人緣很好。一提起老沈的為人，了解他的都會說是一個大好人。
「這樣善良有才氣的好人，現在因為堅守自己的信仰，被關押起來，叫人想起，心裡真不是滋味。」沈宏奇的一個朋友說，「在和他的接觸中，老沈總能給人正向思維，化開人的心結。站在道義上，這麼對人、對社會有益的人怎麼就有罪了呢？」

The dutiful son was illegally detained for more than three months.

07 Nov 2019, 11:58

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Shen Hongqi, a Falun Gong practitioner from Daishan County, Shaanxi Province, was kidnapped by the National Security Brigade and the police station from his home appliance repair service department in the county town. It has been illegally detained for more than three months.
Minghui.com reported that in recent days, the so-called ""case"" that has fallen into Shen Hongqi has arrived at the Daishan County Procuratorate.
On July 22, 2019, Shen Hongqi was escorted by the National Security Team of Daishan County to the police station of Fengming Police Station and Maiheying Police Station. They were kidnapped to the Friday Hotel in Daishan County, and were sentenced to ""iron chairs"" for four days and four nights and illegal criminal detention. Currently, he is being held at the Daishan County Detention Center.
After Shen Hongqi was detained and persecuted, his family kept taking care of his mother and told his old man to go out to work. The mental state of the old man has been very good. Recently, the old man knew his son’s experience and was particularly sad. He asked to go back to his son in person. The family persuaded to stop saying that she was too old to toss.
When the old man saw people all day, he cried and said how filial the son is, how obedient, how ingenious, ""My son is so good, those people are not guilty of detaining good people...""
Some children can not support the elderly to filial piety, the elderly can not afford to fight, most recently did not sleep all night, suddenly appeared cerebral infarction, bedridden, ineffective in hospital rescue, including death. The family is extremely sad.
Shen Hongqi (Shen Hongqi) began to learn Falun Gong in 1997. His body and mind have undergone great changes. The stomach disease he got when he went to school was completely good. He was kind and kind, helpful and especially filial to his parents.
Shen Hongqi's father lived to 90 years old and lived on an oxygen concentrator for five or six years. Once, Shen Hongqi went to the hospital to buy a disposable oxygen bag for his father to take oxygen. However, his village had a power outage and could not supply it. He then took the oxygen absorber and his father to the relatives to plug in the electricity for oxygen. The people in the village admire the old man who has such a filial son. If the old man is so old, he may die early.
Shen Hongqi learns Falun Gong and then asks himself to be true and kind, and takes every matter seriously, considering others in advance.
During his daughter's college days, the state has subsidized grants for poor students. The number of places is limited, and teachers are issued on a rotating basis every year. One year it was his turn to have a child. The child had bought a ticket to go home to go through the formalities. Later, he heard that his daughter had a child in the same class and had a family problem. He even needed the three thousand yuan. He told his daughter to return the ticket to the school and let it go. Classmates.
Shen Hongqi practiced Falun Gong at the beginning. At that time, every household raised pigs to increase income. He raised two big pigs. At that time, the village pigs were popular. When the illegal traders collected pigs in the village, they would even take away the sick pigs for one or two hundred yuan. There was also a big pig in his family. Those people went to his house and asked for a few of them to sell them. He If you say nothing, you would rather throw it away and do things that are detrimental to others. The pig dealer was very moved and said that he had time to learn about Falun Gong.
The matter was passed down as a story in the village, because the one or two hundred yuan at that time was not a small amount, and the small worker was only ten yuan a day.
In the past 30 years, Shen Hongqi has come to the door to serve the maintenance of electrical appliances for dozens of people in the circle. As soon as you mention the old Shen, people who know him will say that they are a good person.
""This kind of good and talented person is now being held up because of his beliefs. It is reminiscent of people. It is really a taste in my heart."" A friend of Shen Hongqi said, ""In his contact with him, Lao Shen can always give positive To think, to open the heart of the people. Standing on the moral, how can people who are good for people and society have sin?""
