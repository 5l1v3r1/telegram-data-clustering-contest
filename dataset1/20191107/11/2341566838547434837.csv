（中央社記者溫貴香台北7日電）國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜遭爆購買南港豪宅，韓辦質疑用國家機器查韓非常不公平。對此，總統府秘書長陳菊今天表示，要說國家機器介入，這個要有證據，歡迎提供證據，「我們支持整個檢調嚴辦」。
陳菊上午到立法院司法及法制委員會進行總統府109年度工作計畫及收支預算報告前受訪做了以上表示。
被詢及韓國瑜豪宅案，韓國瑜競選辦公室指稱用國家機器查韓非常不公平，陳菊對此表示，有沒有用國家機器要有證據，「我們這一代都受到國家機器高度壓制、壓迫甚至是坐牢，像我們這樣的人，像我們現在執政，我們不會濫用國家機器，這是很嚴肅的事情」。
陳菊說，要說國家機器介入，這個要有證據，歡迎提供證據，「我們支持整個檢調嚴辦」；被詢及韓國瑜所塑造的庶民形象是否因而破功，陳菊表示，沒有評論。（編輯：趙蔚蘭）1081107

(Central News Agency reporter Wen Guixiang, Taipei, 7th) The Kuomintang presidential candidate, Yuki Yu, was smashed to buy a luxury home in Nangang. The South Korean government questioned the use of state machines to check South Korea. In this regard, Chen Ju, secretary-general of the presidential palace, said today that if there is evidence of state machine intervention, there is evidence to support the evidence. ""We support the entire inspection and regulation.""
Chen Ju made the above statement in the morning before the Judicial and Legal Committee of the Legislative Yuan conducted the Presidential Office's 109 annual work plan and budget report.
When asked about the case of South Korea's Yu Hao, the South Korean Yu campaign office alleged that it was very unfair to use the state machine to check South Korea. Chen Ju said that there is no evidence to use the state machine. ""Our generation has been highly suppressed, oppressed and even oppressed by the state machine. It’s a jail, people like us, like we are in power now, we don’t abuse the state machine, this is a very serious matter.”
Chen Ju said that if the state machine is involved, there must be evidence. We welcome the evidence. ""We support the entire inspection and strict handling."" The question was asked whether the image of the Dalits created by the Korean Yoga Institute was broken. Chen Ju said that there was no comment. (Editor: Zhao Weilan) 1081107
