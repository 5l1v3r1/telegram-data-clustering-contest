      <h1>Arsene Wenger is too old for ‘front line’ managerial return with Bayern Munich says Marcel Desailly</h1>
      <h2>Wenger has not had a managerial role since leaving Arsenal 18 months ago</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ars%C3%A8newenger">Arsene Wenger</a> has been tipped as a potential appointment for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BayernMunich">Bayern Munich</a>‘s vacant head coach position, but <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marcel-desailly">Marcel Desailly</a> feels it wouldn’t be the right move.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> boss won three league titles with the Gunners, as well as one with Monaco earlier in his career.</p>
      <p>Bayern are on the lookout for a new boss after the departure of Niko Kovac, with Wenger and Ralf Rangnick thought to be the front-runners to take over until the end of the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fc-bayern-munich-news-manager-arsene-wenger-thomas-tuchel-jose-mourinho-a9188681.html">Wenger has spoken about his admiration of Bayern’s approach</a>, former Chelsea and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ACMilan">AC Milan</a> star Desailly feels the time has past for his compatriot to be in the dugout.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>BeIN Sports</i>, the World Cup-winning defender feels Wenger still has lots to give to the game, but in a different role.</p>
      <p>“Bayern Munich is a real institution. But to have him back in [the] front line I’m not sure,” Desailly said.</p>
      <p>“He’s maybe more than that now. He should not be in the dugout. It’s not for him any more.</p>
      <p>“He has great ability, great other possibility to restructure, to build up the philosophy of the club toward the first team and the academy in the [technical director] role, but as a front line [coach] we don’t see him any more. He’s 70 years old, he’s tempered by it.”</p>
      <p>Bayern had Hans-Dieter Flick in the dugout on Wednesday night, as they beat Olympiacos 2-0 in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>They now face a headline clash against Borussia Dortmund in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> this weekend, before the final two-week international break of the calendar year.</p>
