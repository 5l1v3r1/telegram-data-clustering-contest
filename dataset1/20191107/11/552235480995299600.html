      <h2>A suspected drug dealer has claimed in court that the scales in his kitchen were for measuring out dog treats- not cannabis.</h2>

      <p>Stephen Wheatley was found with more than half a kilo of the class B drug when his home in Simpson Court Scott Crescent, Troon, was raided by police officers.</p>
      <p>Police found cannabis with an estimated street value of between £2,200 and £3,500 when they searched the home on September 30 this year.</p>
      <p>They found three bags of “herbal material” and other drug “paraphernalia.”</p>
      <p>But, it was claimed in mitigation the scales were used for measuring the quantity of treats for Wheatley’s dog.</p>
      <p>Wheatley, aged 28, appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court on Tuesday, October 29.</p>
      <p>He admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis at his home of September 30 this year.</p>
      <p>Fiscal Depute Scott Toal said the search unfolded at 2.30pm.</p>
      <p>He told the court: “Entry was forced and the property searched.</p>
      <p>“Among other things, officers found three bags of herbal material and a vacuum packed bag containing other material.</p>
      <p>“Clear bags were recovered at the time and items were tested and found to be cannabis, 504 grammes with a street value of between £2,200 and £3,500.</p>
      <p>“The accused was interviewed and told officers he stored them for an individual who was not named.</p>
      <p>“They recovered scales and material elsewhere in the property.”</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Ms Kane said: “He accepts that he was asked to store cannabis, which he did for two weeks and that was his involvement.”</p>
      <p>But Sheriff John Montgomery asked: “Why did he have scales and other paraphernalia?</p>
      <p>“ I have heard from the fiscal depute that scales, associated with drug dealing, were found in the house.”</p>
      <p>Scott Toal said: “Scales were recovered from the kitchen worktop and the cannabis was found in another room. Clear bags were found in the kitchen as well.”</p>
      <p>Ms Kane said: “It’s his position the scales were nothing to do with the drugs.”</p>
      <p>The case was recalled for later in the morning and when it returned Ms Kane said: “The scales were used to measure out dog treats.”</p>
      <p>However, Sheriff Montgomery continued the case until December 20 so that a proof in mitigation is heard, which essential means testing the veracity of the defence’s explanation.</p>
      <p>Wheatley’s bail conditions were continued.</p>
