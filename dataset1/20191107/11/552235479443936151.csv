Proposals to give the former Garshake Waterworks site a new lease of life having lain empty for the past 12 years have been refused.
Neighbours have expressed concern that the area has suffered from antisocial behaviour since the business owner took charge of the site.
Mr Lenny Donnelly, who operates LWS Engineering in Helensburgh, has outgrown his premises and planned to move to the land at the top of Garshake Road in Dumbarton for his Land Rover repair yard.
However, he has already been storing some vehicles at the site which objectors say has attracted bother.
West Dunbartonshire Council's planning committee refused the application yesterday (Wednesday).
A report which went to councillors read: “Since acquiring the site, the applicant has failed to secure it and antisocial activity has increased since they have occupied the site.”
Worries were also put forward by objectors about environmental concerns with one saying: “Fires have been started and the black toxic smoke emanating from this has a significant impact for residents in the area.”
Planning officers, however, recommended the application was granted saying it will result in the “regeneration and partial redevelopment of the area”.
Objections raised about the fact that it is against planning policy to allow such a development within the area are addressed by planners who state: “Whilst the proposed specialist vehicle repair business is not fully supported by greenbelt policies, it is considered a departure from these policies can be justified as the land constitutes a vacant and derelict brownfield site.”
