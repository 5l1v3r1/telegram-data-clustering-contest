Former Cavalier set to play for Beermen

07 Nov 2019, 11:03

WHEN San Miguel returns to the court on Saturday, it is likely to parade a new import.
The Beermen are set to replace injured import Dez Wells with a former Cleveland Cavalier player John Holland in the PBA Governors' Cup.
Wells has yet to recover from an ankle injury that he sustained against the Meralco Bolts last October 27, and sat out when the Beermen played Blackwater Elite on Wednesday.
San Miguel claimed a hard-earned 99-96 win in overtime, but with Wells still not at 100%, the team decided to select a new import.
""Since sinabi ni Wells he can't play on Saturday, we got a backup. We can't afford na walang import for the second time,"" San Miguel coach Leo Austria told the league website.
The Beermen expect Holland to arrive on Friday, in time for SMB's next game against Rain or Shine on Saturday.
Holland briefly played for Cleveland in 2017-2018, and also had stints in the G-League. The 31-year-old last played in Puerto Rico before getting the call from SMB.
The Beermen, seeking a grand slam, have six wins against three losses.
