      <p>Bayern Munich's search for a new manager has led them to former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger after they sacked Niko Kovac this week.</p>
      <p>Wenger, 70, has emerged as the top candidate after the Germans saw their advances for various other coaches turned down.</p>
      <p>A move for the French coach is seen as a short-term solution to fix the problems they have had this season and which led to the dismissal of Kovac.</p>
      <p>The idea is to offer Wenger a contract until the end of the season with the objective of then appointing a younger coach next summer to lead their project for the coming years.</p>
      <p>According to Bild, the details of the contract will be negotiated in the coming days, although there has already been a phone call between Wenger and Bayern's CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.</p>
      <p>Bayern want a new man in place before Nov. 15 with the aim of him then being able to take charge after the international break.</p>
      <p>Before Wenger, Thomas Tuchel (PSG), Ralf Rangnick (ex-Leipzig) and Erik ten Hag (Ajax) had all been linked, but none of them were prepared to take the job on at this stage of the season.</p>
