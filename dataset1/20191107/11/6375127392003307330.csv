MALAPIT nang ikasal ang 32-year-old Kapuso actress na si Sheena Halili sa kanyang lawyer-fiance na si Jeron Manzanero. The two got engaged nung August 26, 2018  at kamakailan lamang ay lumipad ang dalawa patungong Tokyo, Japan for their pre-nup shoots.
Tulad ng iba pang soon-to-be-wed couples, ayaw pa ring magbigay ng detalye sina Sheena at Jeron sa kanilang nalalapit na pag-iisang-dibdib.  Ang kanilang wedding planner ay si Chikee Uy.
Si Sheena ay produkto ng original talent reality show ng GMA, ang unang season ng “Starstruck” kung saan sina Jennylyn Mercado, Mark Herras, Yasmien Kurdi at Rainier Castillo ang Top 4 winners.
Bago ang kanyang fiancé na si Jeron, na-link noon si Sheena kina Rainier at Rocco Nacino.
