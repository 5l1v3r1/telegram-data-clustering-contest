Ronnie binago ang paniniwala sa long distance relationship
07 Nov 2019, 11:21 by Aster Amoyo
TO some, hindi nagwu-work out ang LDR or long distance relationship pero hindi ito totoo sa singer-actor-host at soon-to-be-pilot na si Ronnie Liang dahil limang taon na umano sila ng kanyang New York-based girlfriend na isang nurse at isa na umanong American citizen.
Inamin ng Pinoy Dream Academy 2nd runner-up in 2006 na kahit hindi siya ang naging big winner kundi si Yeng Constantino na sinundan ni Jay-R Siaboc, malaki umano ang nagawa ng nasabing reality show sa kanyang buhay at career.
Bukod sa cash prize, nabigyan din umano siya ng isang brand new house and lot na ibinigay niya sa kanyang nakatatandang kapatid na babae na may asawa at walang sariling tirahan.
Paglabas niya ng PDA ay doon na rin umano nagsimulang  bumuhos ang mga blessing sa kanya dahil nabigyan siya ng chance sa recording, acting, hosting at maging sa mga live shows and concerts.  Dito na rin umano nagsimulang magbago ang takbo ng buhay ng kanyang pamilya na hirap noon.
“Noon kasi palipat-lipat kami ng tirahan dahil madalas kaming napapaalis sa aming nirerentahan sa kakulangan ng pambayad,” pagbabahagi ni Ronnie.
“May maliit na talyer ang tatay pero ang kinikita niya ay hindi pa sapat sa amin ng mga kapatid ko kaya natuto akong maghanap-buhay at a young age.  Kung anu-ano ring trabaho ang pinasok ko para makatulong sa pamilya ko at matustusan ang aking pag-aaral.  Sa awa ng Diyos, nakapagtapos ako ng college sa Holy Angel University sa Angeles, Pampanga pero hindi ako nakapag-trabaho dahil nabaling na ang attention ko sa pagkanta at pag-arte,” aniya.
Nang maganda na ang kita ni Ronnie ay nakapagpatayo na siya ng sarili nilang bahay at nabigyan din niya ang kanyang ama ng sarili nitong talyer  at natulungan din niya ang iba niyang mga kapatid pero three years ago ay sumakabilang-buhay ang kanyang ina.
“Hindi na masasaksihan ng mother ko ang pag-graduate ko sa flying school,” aniya.
This month ay nakatakdang grumadweyt si Ronnie bilang piloto sa APG International Aviation Academy sa Subic na inaasahang dadaluhan ng kanyang girlfriend na nasa New York, USA, at ang kanyang pamilya – ang kanyang ama at mga kapatid.  Pero bago ito ay haharapin muna niya ang kanyang concert sa Music Museum tonight, Friday, November 8 at 8 p.m. na pinamagatang “Love x Romance” produced ng Viva Live.  Magiging special guests ni Ronnie ang Pop Star na si Sarah Geronimo, Ella Cruz at Janine Tenoso.

Ronnie changed his belief in long distance relationship
07 Nov 2019, 11:21 by Aster Amoyo
TO some, the LDR or long distance relationship doesn't work out, but that's not true of singer-actor-host and soon-to-be-pilot Ronnie Liang since he and his New York-based girlfriend have been dating for five years. a nurse and one alleged American citizen.
The Pinoy Dream Academy 2nd runner-up admitted in 2006 that although he was not the big winner but Yeng Constantino, followed by Jay-R Siaboc, the reality show has done a great job in his life and career.
In addition to the cash prize, he is also given a brand new house and lot which he gave to his older sister who is married and has no home.
After she left the PDA, it was said that the blessings began to pour out on her as she was given the opportunity to record, act, hosting and even live shows and concerts. It is here that her family's life began to change in the face of hard times.
""It's because we move so much because we often get rid of our rent because of the lack of payment,"" Ronnie shared.
“My dad had a small studio but his income wasn't enough for my siblings and I learned to make a living at a young age. What kind of jobs did I come in to help my family and finance my education? By the grace of God, I finished college at Holy Angel University in Angeles, Pampanga but was unable to work because my attention was turned to singing and acting, ”he said.
When Ronnie's income was good, he was able to build his own house and even give his father his own studio and help his other siblings, but three years ago his mother passed away.
""My mother will never see me graduate from flying school,"" she said.
This month, Ronnie is set to graduate as a pilot at the APG International Aviation Academy in Subic, expected to be attended by his girlfriend in New York, USA, and his family - his father and siblings. But before that he will hold his concert at the Music Museum tonight, Friday, November 8 and 8 p.m. titled “Love x Romance” produced by Viva Live. Ronnie will be special guests of Pop Star Sarah Geronimo, Ella Cruz and Janine Tenoso.
