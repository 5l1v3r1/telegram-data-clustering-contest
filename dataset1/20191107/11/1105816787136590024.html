      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:35:28+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Kylie Jenner and Drake are in a relationship, but it’s the same relationship they’ve been in for a long time – just friends.</p>
      <p>Sources close to both Kylie and American rapper tell <i><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/06/kylie-jenner-drake-not-dating-birthday-friends/">TMZ</a></i>  they are not spending any romantic time together, as other outlets have reported or speculated. Reportedly, the duo have been at some events together, including the rapper’s recent 33rd birthday party, simply because they are pals.</p>
      <p>Their friendship has endured despite Drake’s beef with Kylie’s brother-in-law, Kanye West, but sources added there they are in no way, shape or form dating.</p>
