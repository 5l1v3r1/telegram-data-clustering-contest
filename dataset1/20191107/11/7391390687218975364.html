      <p>In terms of glow ups, Greggs has had an off-the-chart year. I mean don't even get me going on their vegan sausage rolls. And what's the best way to celebrate an incredible year? Why, with an incredible Christmas menu, of course. And you guys, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/greggs-is-working-on-vegan-versions-of-all-their-best-sellers-im-so-here-for-it-18705989">Greggs' 2019 Christmas offerings</a> are a real insight into celebrating greatness in style.</p>
      <p>Screw holly, this year I'm decking the halls with cheese and onion slices. And I'd much rather a snog with a Belgian bun than some damp-mouthed letch under the mistletoe.</p>
      <p>Greggs has joined legions of culinary establishments in creating their <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-are-christmas-sandwiches-hitting-supermarkets-in-2019-because-its-never-too-early-18816153">very own Christmas-themed menu</a>. Let's be real, I feel like you could legitimately hit up a different restaurant, chain, cafe, or sarnie shop in the UK for each day of December and <i>still</i> not run out of options.</p>
      <p>Good old Greggs has come through <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-can-you-get-greggs-home-delivery-these-are-the-areas-blessed-with-fresh-pastries-18171904">with myriad delicious offerings</a> from savoury to sweet to hot drinks. However, I will say in advance, for a company whose vegan dish was potentially one of the most discussed vegan food goods of 2019, there's nothing vegan available. And their savoury specials all contain meat, so veggies may feel slightly left out too. But luckily Greggs have been <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/greggs-is-working-on-vegan-versions-of-all-their-best-sellers-im-so-here-for-it-18705989">hinting at a load of new items</a> to rival their regular meat and dairy laden products, so maybe 2020 will be where it's at.</p>
      <h3>Festive Bake</h3>

      <h3>Christmas Lunch Sandwich</h3>
      <p>Not just any old sarnie, this one is made up of sliced turkey breast with pork, sage and onion stuffing, sweetcure bacon, and fresh salad leaves, topped off with a cranberry and port sauce and mayonnaise.</p>

      <h3>Pigs Under Blanket Baguette</h3>
      <p>Guys, we have a hybrid. This one is a play on the old Christmas table favourite, pigs in blankets. It's a baguette filled with succulent pork sausages, sweetcure bacon, pork, and sage and onion stuffing, with a cranberry and port sauce.</p>
