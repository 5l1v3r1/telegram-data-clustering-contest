        <b>Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris has had surgery <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49945886">on the left elbow he dislocated</a> in a 3-0 defeat by Brighton in October.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The France international fell awkwardly as he failed to hold a cross and, initially, it was thought he would not need to be operated on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/hugo-lloris-injury-update/">But Spurs said:</a> "Surgery was advised after further reviews by specialists found the elbow remained unstable.</p>
      <p>"Our club captain remains on course to return to training in the early part of next year."</p>
      <p>Lloris received oxygen when being treated after suffering the injury and was then carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital.</p>
