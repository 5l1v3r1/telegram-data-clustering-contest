One of Britain's most beloved actresses has spoken out in support of a BAFTA competition for unsung heroes.
Olivia Colman, BAFTA Leading Actress winner 2019, has spoken out in support of the BAFTA ""For the Love of Film"" competition, which searches the nation for inspiring individuals ad local heroes who have worked hard to help the public access and engage in cinema, with the actress highlighting London’s Peckhamplex when talking about its community spirit.
Colman said: ""It’s really exciting to see BAFTA honour and recognise people who work tirelessly to share the joy of film with their local communities. The ‘For the Love of Film’ competition is an excellent platform to showcase the unsung heroes of the UK’s film industry.
""A brilliant example of an organisation playing a vital role in making movies accessible to their community is local cinema, Peckhamplex – they provide all films all day at one affordable price, amazing Q&As and special interest weeks. They are really community minded and helpful; I couldn't praise them enough.""

Last year's inaugural competition saw honours for Dan Ellis, Founder and Managing Director of Jam Jar Cinema, and Iain MacColl, Senior Operator of Screen Machine.
On the competition, Amanda Berr, Chief Executive of BAFTA, said: ""Film has the power to change lives, which is why BAFTA is committed to celebrating inspiring individuals from across the UK who are ensuring that film is at the heart of their local communities.
""Last year I was so impressed by the work of both Screen Machine and Jam Jar Cinema and I can’t wait to see who is selected this year.""
