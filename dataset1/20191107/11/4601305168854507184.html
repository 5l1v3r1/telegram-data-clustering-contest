      <h1>A UFO-themed brothel is now providing remote services for its alien sex robots</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nz88vz/take-me-to-your-boner-inside-nevadas-alien-themed-brothel">Alien Cathouse</a> near Las Vegas is the "final frontier of sexual adventure," a popular refuge for anyone seeking a little action in their own Area 51. From their <a href="https://www.aliencathouse.com/">website</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>On an interstellar mission to bring erotic pleasure to the entire universe, the Cosmic Kittens from the planet Venus 69 set out on a fantastic voyage across deep space — but a freak mishap caused their starship to crash land on planet Earth just outside Nevada’s mysterious Area 51 Air Force facility. Now, stranded on a strange planet populated by so many repressed men and women fraught with a galaxy’s worth of lust, the Cosmic Kittens have vowed to use their extraterrestrial sexual prowess to help horny Earthlings satisfy their insatiable carnal desires.</blockquote>
      <p>In addition to escorts, fetish services, and plush alien dolls already offered at the Cathouse, they'll soon be offering a cutting-edge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics">teledildonics</a> program. According to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/sex-robot-brothel-using-teledildonics-20765805">Daily Mail</a>, the Cathouse is investing heavily in <a href="https://www.kiiroo.com/pages/teledildonics">KIIROO</a>'s remote sex robot technology, so that customers can enjoy their services even in a galaxy far, far away. "Visitors" to the remote alien brothel would need to provide their own Interactive Vibrating Masturbator for Men or OhMiBod toy and presumably a stable wifi connection in order to get the full haptic experience.</p>
      <blockquote>The Cathouse’s Rod Thompson told Daily Star Online why they have added a robot to their line-up: "For clients that have certain … fetishes that courtesans might not be interested in, the robot could fulfill those."<br/><br/>Asked how the Cathouse’s flesh-and-blood denizens felt about working alongside an AI rival, Rod said they were all for it: "The Courtesans are actually excited about the additional revenue stream to Alien Cathouse, and themselves … as well as the additional opportunities that might present themselves for interested parties wanting to party with a real flesh and blood courtesan and with an AI sex robot at the same time."</blockquote>
      <p>It's only fitting that the most technologically advanced brothel in the country would be sci-fi themed.</p>
