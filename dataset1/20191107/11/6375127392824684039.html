      <h3>WHEN San Miguel returns to the court on Saturday, it is likely to parade a new import.</h3>
      <p>The Beermen are set to replace injured import Dez Wells with a former Cleveland Cavalier player John Holland in the PBA Governors' Cup.</p>
      <p>Wells has yet to recover from an ankle injury that he sustained against the Meralco Bolts last October 27, and sat out when the Beermen played Blackwater Elite on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>San Miguel claimed a hard-earned 99-96 win in overtime, but with Wells still not at 100%, the team decided to select a new import.</p>
      <p>"Since sinabi ni Wells he can't play on Saturday, we got a backup. We can't afford na walang import for the second time," San Miguel coach Leo Austria told the league website.</p>
      <p>The Beermen expect Holland to arrive on Friday, in time for SMB's next game against Rain or Shine on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Holland briefly played for Cleveland in 2017-2018, and also had stints in the G-League. The 31-year-old last played in Puerto Rico before getting the call from SMB.</p>
      <p>The Beermen, seeking a grand slam, have six wins against three losses.</p>
