      <p>A police officer has been charged with murder over the death of fomer footballer Dalian Atkinson.</p>
      <p>Atkinson collapsed and later died after he was Tasered in Telford in August 2016.</p>
      <p>The former Aston Villa striker was struck by a 50,000-volt shock after reportedly threatening his elderly father on the doorstep of his home.</p>
      <p>He went into cardiac arrest and died in hospital 90 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Witnesses on Meadow Close claimed officers discharged their stun guns twice more after Atkinson had hit the pavement.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution confirmed on Thursday that two officers of West Mercia police had been charged over the death.</p>
      <p>One of those officers has been charged with murder, the other with ABH. A third officer, who was also subject to the investigation, was not charged.</p>

      <p>Speaking on behalf of Atkinson's family, solicitor Kate Maynard said: "Dalianâ€™s family welcomes the decision to put the conduct of police officers before a jury but regrets that already more than three years have passed since Dalian died."</p>
      <p>After his death, Atkinson's family vowed: "We are determined to get justice for him, which means getting to the truth.</p>
      <p>"We are looking to the (police watchdog) IPCC to carry out a thorough and robust investigation that will ultimately provide transparency and accountability. Dalian's memory requires nothing less."</p>
      <p>Charges were later brought against the officers after the final report into Atkinson's death was filed.</p>
      <p>The officers will appear at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday afternoon.</p>

      <p>A former friend had said Atkinson had come out of hospital following an extended stay, a week before his death.</p>
      <p>Nephew Fabian, 32, had admitted: "He had some health issues that he was trying to get through."</p>
      <p>Thousands flocked to his funeral in 2016, including former Villa teammates Ian Taylor and Tommy Johnson.</p>
