      <h1>Bale left Bernabeu (again!) before full time as Madrid beat Galatasaray</h1>
      <h2>The Welshman has not stayed until the final whistle in the last three matches</h2>

      <p>He did it against Leganes, again against Real Betis and now against Galatasaray. It doesn't matter who Real Madrid are playing or how they are doing, Gareth Bale is leaving early.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, who missed the 6-0 win over the Turkish side in the Champions on Wednesday, abandoned the Bernabeu in his car before the final whistle.</p>
      <p>Bale, who has now missed Madrid's last five games injured, was caught on camera by OK Diario leaving at 22.43, when there were still eight minutes to go. He missed Karim Benzema's second goal and Rodrygo's hat-trick strike.</p>
      <p>Madrid have an internal code that states that players not in the squad cannot leave before the final 10 minutes of a game. It seems Bale is leaving as soon as 80 minutes is up.</p>
      <p>It will increase the debate around Bale, who has been included in Ryan Giggs' Wales squad for the upcoming European Championship qualifiers this month.</p>
      <p>If he plays in those games having not been fit to play for Madrid for so long, it will raise further questions about his commitment to Madrid as talk of a January transfer continues.</p>
