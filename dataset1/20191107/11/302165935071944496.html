      <p>ANKARA, Nov 7 — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today that Uefa was discriminating against Turkey’s football team following a controversy over the players’ use of military salutes on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Uefa opened disciplinary hearings against Turkey last month after its players saluted during Euro 2020 qualifiers — a gesture seen as supporting the country’s military offensive in Syria.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said this was part of a wider campaign against Turkish sports stars who supported the operation.</p>
      <p>“Sportsmen representing our country abroad are being subjected to a lynching campaign since the start of the operation,” Erdogan said at a press conference in Ankara.</p>
      <p>“We reject Uefa’s discriminating, unjust and political attitude towards our national team and clubs,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It is the natural right of our sportsmen to salute our soldiers after a victory.”</p>
      <p>The players made the military salutes during anthems and after goals against Albania and France last month.</p>
      <p>Uefa’s press chief Philip Townsend said at the time that the gesture “could be considered a provocation” given the ban on references to politics and religion. — AFP</p>
