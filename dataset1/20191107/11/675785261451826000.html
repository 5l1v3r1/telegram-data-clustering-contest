      <p>Garth Stirrat told Mirror Sport: "I have no comment to make on an issue from my very distant past and which I have no intention of relitigating."</p>

      <p>Stirrat, from Wellington, expressed his delight at being named as fourth official for England's defeat to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>"Was proud as punch to be involved in the T20i in Nelson as 4th umpire. Wasn't a bad way to spend the birthday too," he wrote.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for putting on weather and a sell-out crowd."</p>
      <p>Stirrat previously played cricket in his homeland before later venturing into umpiring.</p>
      <p>Stirrat had previously been chief executive of the New Zealand Professional Golfers’ Association but resigned in 2008.</p>
      <p>He also held a post as head of the New Zealand Hotel Council but quit as news of his X-rated antics came to light.</p>
      <p>On his profile on the New Zealand Professional Cricket Umpires' Association (NZPCUA) page, he explains his decision to go into umpiring.</p>
      <p>"I’ve always said it’s the best seat in the house – if you like watching cricket and have a passion for it, you can’t get any closer to the action," he said.</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport has also contacted NZPCUA for comment.</p>
