      <h1>Hugo Lloris: Tottenham reverse decision as goalkeeper undergoes elbow surgery</h1>
      <h2>Lloris is out of action until the new year</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham</a> have released a statement confirming that goalkeeper <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Hugo_Lloris">Hugo Lloris</a> has undergone surgery on his elbow.</p>
      <p>The World Cup-winning captain suffered a dislocated elbow in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> game against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brighton-and-hove-albion">Brighton</a> in early October, landing awkwardly after dropping a cross just a few minutes into the match.</p>
      <p>Brighton scored from that mistake and went on to win 3-0, but the longer-term impact of the moment was that Lloris faced an extended period on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Spurs initially released a statement saying that there was ligament damage as well as the dislocation, but that no surgery would be required – but on Thursday a second message confirmed that he had indeed necessitated an operation on the injury.</p>
      <p>The change comes after Lloris’ “elbow remained unstable,” according to the clinical tests, but appears not to have impacted on his expected recovery timeframe.</p>
      <p>Spurs’ statement in full read: “Following further clinical testing and examination, Hugo Lloris has now undergone surgery on his left elbow.</p>
      <p>“The France goalkeeper dislocated his elbow and sustained ligament damage during our Premier League match against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion last month.</p>
      <p>“Surgery was advised after further reviews by specialists found the elbow remained unstable.</p>
      <p>“Our Club captain remains on course to return to training in the early part of next year.”</p>
      <p>In his absence, Paulo Gazzaniga has started five games in succession, conceding four goals in that time but keeping clean sheets in back-to-back Champions League encounters against Red Star Belgrade, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/tottenham-vs-crvena-zvedza-uefa-champions-league-2019-lo-celso-red-star-belgrade-a9188756.html">a 4-0 win in Serbia coming on Wednesday night</a>.</p>
      <p>Lloris, 32, has been at Tottenham since 2012 and has played over 300 games for the club.</p>
