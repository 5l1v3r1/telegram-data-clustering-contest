      <h3>DESPITE his personal bad experience with television giant ABS-CBN Corp., Speaker Alan Peter CAyetano assured the public that the network’s bid for a new franchise will have a fair hearing.</h3>
      <p>In an interview, Cayetano said the committee on franchise will soon start hearing the pending proposals for  granting ABS-CBN another 25-year franchise to operate during which several issues against the network will be addressed.</p>
      <p>Cayetano said he himself had a bad experience with the company during the 2016 national elections.</p>
      <p>“There are people with issues, narinig niyo sa ating Pangulo. Ako mismo, apat kaming naimbitahan na vice presidential candidates sa DZMM.</p>
      <p>“Yung isa nilabas sa 6:30 p.m. news, sa Bandila, sa Umagang Kay Ganda at lunch time. Yung dalawa sa amin, DZMM and then Bandila. Yung isa sa amin sa DZMM (lang), hindi lumabas sa iba,” Cayetano complained without naming names.</p>
      <p>According to the House leader the company should answer the complaints of the other candidates, especially President Duterte who paid P2 million but his political ad was not aired.</p>
      <p>To date there are at least six bills proposing the approval of the franchise of ABS-CBN which will expire in March 2020.</p>
      <p>When Cayetano was asked if the House will grant the renewal of the ABS-CBN franchise before it expires, he did not categorically answer but only said the chamber will be “fair” to all camps.</p>
      <p>“Ang ginagarantiya ko ay ang 18th Congress will be fair at magkakaroon ng hearing.</p>
      <p>“On one hand there are real issues. So may mga katanungan kami or issues.</p>
      <p>“But I’m sure meron ding stand at meron din pag sagot diyan,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Mag hearing muna tayo, pakinggan muna natin yung issues—base dun sa mapakinggan natin, we will make a decision. We will make a decision—the decision is the consequence of the hearing and hindi baliktad,” he added.</p>
