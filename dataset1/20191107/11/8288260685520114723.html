      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | The claret and blue captain is in line for his first call-up to the England national team and fans of his side are all saying the same thing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:47:54+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans are calling for Jack Grealish to be included in the latest England squad.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> captain is in line for his first cal-up to Gareth Southgate's senior side having featured for the Under-21s in the past.</p>
      <p>Calls for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> to be included in the England team for European Championships qualifiers against Montenegro and Serbia later this month have grown after he missed out on the last couple of squads.</p>
      <p>Grealish has watched his Villa team-mate Tyrone Mings make his debut for the Three Lions but he has remained down the pecking order below Leicester City's James Maddison and Chelsea's Mason Mount.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, before Grealish picked up a calf injury against Manchester City last month - one that ruled him out of Villa's past couple of games - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-grealish-england-gareth-southgate-17215030">he had been an influential figure for his boyhood team</a> .</p>
      <p>He netted an equaliser against Brighton and Hove Albion and set up the winner for Matt Targett in injury time - a performance that led to Grealish being touted for the next England squad.</p>
      <p>An official announcement is expected this afternoon and Villa fans want to see their hero included.</p>
