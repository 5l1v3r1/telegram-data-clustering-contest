      <p>SINGAPORE sovereign wealth fund GIC has bought a 50 per cent stake in a Beijing office building from Beijing Capital Land for an undisclosed sum, making it the sole owner post-acquisition.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong-listed Beijing Capital Land is the flagship firm of Chinese state-owned enterprise Beijing Capital Group's real estate business.</p>
      <p>The grade A 42-storey building is located in the centre of the Lize Financial Business District, and is the district's tallest building.</p>
      <p>The site's area is 26,352 square metres (sq m) and the property has a gross floor area of 38,612 sq m.</p>
      <p>It stands along Lize Road, a major road within the emerging central business district, said GIC.</p>

      <p>The office building is directly connected to an interchange station for key public transport lines, and upcoming infrastructure development in the business district will enhance its accessibility.</p>
      <p>"This investment reflects GICâ€™s continued confidence in China, and commitment to acquiring quality assets with good long-term earning potential in this market," said GIC.</p>
      <p>The Chinese building acquisition comes after GIC on Tuesday said it had <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/gic-charter-hall-jv-acquires-a-grade-office-building-in-parramatta-sydney">entered into a joint venture</a> with Australia-listed property group Charter Hall to acquire an A-grade office building in Sydney for an undisclosed sum.</p>
      <p>GIC currently has "well over" US$100 billion in assets under management.</p>
