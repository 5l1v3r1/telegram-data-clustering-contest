BALIK si Coco Martin sa pagiging lead actor-director at producer ng bago  niyang Metro Manila Film Festival I(MMFF) entry, ang action-comedy na “3pol Trobol: Huli Ka Balbon” under his own CCM Productions.
Unang sumabak si Coco sa pagdidirek ng pelikula in 2017 sa pamamagitan ng kanyang sariling version ng “Ang Panday” na unang pinagbidahan ng namayapang Movie King na si Fernando Poe, Jr.  Si Coco rin ang nagbida at nag-produce ng nasabing pelikula.
Wala mang formal background si Coco sa pagdidirek, natutunan niya ito sa  kanyang long-running action-drama TV series na “FPJ’s Ang Probinsyano” where he serves as one of the directors.
Although irreplaceable ang yumaong si FPJ, marami ang nagsasabi na si Coco umano ang pinakabagong version ng kanyang idolong si FPJ.
