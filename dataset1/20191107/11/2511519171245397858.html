      <h1>Bill Gates says Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax would leave him ‘counting what he had left over’</h1>
      <h2>Microsoft founder and billionaire says he will not make ‘political declarations’ about who he will vote for</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:12:56+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Osborne</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BillGates">Bill Gates</a> has criticised <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>’s proposed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wealth-tax">wealth tax</a>, claiming it left him doing “a little math about what I have left over”.</p>
      <p>The Microsoft founder and billionaire spoke about the Democratic presidential candidate’s plan at <i>The New York Times</i> DealBook conference on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve paid over $10bn [£7.8bn] in taxes. I’ve paid more than anyone in taxes,” he said. ”If I had to pay $20bn, it’s fine.</p>
      <p>“But when you say I should pay $100bn, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Sorry, I’m just kidding.”</p>
      <p>Ms Warren has proposed a 6 per cent tax on wealth above $1bn.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would speak to Ms Warren about her tax plans, he said: “You know I’m not sure how open minded minded she is.</p>
      <p>“Or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.”</p>
      <p>Mr Gates also said he would not make “political declarations” about who he would vote for if the choice was between <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> and Ms Warren.</p>
      <p>“But I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach is even – as much as I disagree with some of the policy things that are out there, I do think a professional approach to the office – whoever I decide would have the more professional approach in the current situation probably will weigh, is the thing that I will weigh the most.</p>
      <p>“I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.”</p>
      <p>Ms Warren responded on Twitter, saying she would be happy to meet with Mr Gates to “explain exactly how much you’d pay under my wealth tax”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I promise it’s not $100bn.”</p>
      <p>Mr Gates is worth an estimated $107bn, according to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Last week, Ms Warren <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-health-plan-tax-2020-election-a9181631.html">revealed how she would fund her controversial Medicare for All plan</a>, insisting ordinary Americans would not pay “one penny” extra in taxes.</p>
