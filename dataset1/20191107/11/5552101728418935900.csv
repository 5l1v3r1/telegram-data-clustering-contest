盟可睞（MONCLER）7日晚間在台北信義新光三越A9開設的MONCLER Genius台灣限時概念店舉辦派對，嘉賓昆凌自稱「運動甜心」，雖未能征服滑雪這項運動，但決定先穿上好看的MONCLER，在摔倒之前先拍好勝利網美照，自已發在社群軟體上秀一下。
昆凌穿著全白的3 MONCLER Grenoble系列連身褲裝，笑稱自己走「牛仔很忙」路線，她說：「我喜歡它的牛仔元素以及流蘇，把羽絨衣做得很有趣味性。」她並透露不喜歡像米其林寶寶外型的羽絨衣，「我覺得那種外型很難駕馭，我喜歡是外面平平的一整片，要有造型，米其林部分可以放在裡面。」她也說服裝外觀一定要美，「頂多我在裡面穿很多層保暖」。


昆凌以一襲來自全新合作系列3 MONCLER Grenoble的白色流蘇連身衣華麗亮相：連身褲NT$107,000、雪靴NT$18,200。

她稱自己是「運動甜心」：「是我自己在說啦！但田徑運動這類我唯一不會的就是滑雪，這件連身褲讓我有很輕鬆的感覺，我覺得它是會陪著我在滑雪之路上的伴耶，不過我在摔倒前一定會先拍好勝利照片。」她笑說自己跟老公周杰倫都是滑雪初學者，如果要挑選，會幫他挑藍色外套，「淡藍色配白色的雪地很美」。


張軒睿身著酷黑7 MONCLER Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara聯名潮服帥氣現身；T-Shirt NT$13,600、羽絨背心NT$41,700、長褲NT$22,000、球鞋NT$21,200。

張軒睿穿著藤原浩設計的7 MONCLER Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara聯名系列，他說：「這跟我的私服滿像的，因為是街頭運動風，我很喜歡，又融入了軍事風格、復古潮流、還結合了美國歷史、精靈寶可夢等元素，是冬天可以很不一樣的嘗試。」他補充解釋，「雖然我平常不會抓寶，但小時候很喜歡寶可夢，覺得好可愛，我有收集好多玩偶，都會帶去學校。」
第一次穿著MONCLER的他很開心，「之前在國外有逛過店，現在穿上後才知道跟以前的羽絨外套很不同，以前穿只是為了保暖，但這件背心非常輕，兼具機能性保暖外又很有型。」
