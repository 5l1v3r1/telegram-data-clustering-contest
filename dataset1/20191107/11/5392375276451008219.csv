Apple Watch is one step away from 50% market share2.8 (56.67%) 6 votes
Apple has complete dominance in the smartwatch market with its Apple Watch. This is what emerges from the analysis conducted by Strategy Analytics, which sees the company reaching peaks never explored, with 47.9% market share.
Only 2 percentage points are missing and the fateful half market share will be reached. It would mean that for every 2 smartwatches, one is branded Apple. A success that is hard to imagine at the outset.
In general, the data nevertheless offers a healthy picture for the market, with a 42% increase in shipments compared to last year, with Samsung leading the best year-on-year growth (73%).



But there is another big name that seems to have a promising future, and it is Google. The fresh owner of the Fitbit brand. Which has fallen from second to third place in the last year.
Fitbit will continue its business for the moment but will be fully into Google’s activities. Under the banner Made by Google, which includes all devices designed by the Mountain View company.
The experience acquired by Fitbit in the field of activity monitoring but also in the design of smartwatches should be used in Google projects and could accelerate its development. Google Fit, the health platform of the California giant, should also benefit from technologies developed by the manufacturer.
Global Smartwatch Shipments Leap to 14 Million Units in Q3 2019




Apple shipped 6.8 million smartwatches worldwide in Q3 2019, rising an above-average 51 percent from 4.5 million in Q3 2018. Apple Watch remains a long way ahead of the chasing pack and its global smartwatch marketshare has grown from 45 percent to 48 percent in the past year.
Samsung shipped 1.9 million smartwatches worldwide in Q3 2019, almost doubling from 1.1 million a year ago. Samsung’s global smartwatch marketshare has jumped from 11 percent to 13 percent during the past year. Samsung is the world’s number two smartwatch vendor.
Fitbit shipped 1.6 million smartwatches worldwide in Q3 2019, inching up slightly from 1.5 million in Q3 2018. However, Fitbit’s global smartwatch marketshare fell to 11 percent this quarter, down from 15 percent a year ago.
