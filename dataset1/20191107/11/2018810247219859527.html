      <p>Cloud gaming is the latest frontier tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, are trying to crack into. It seems Valve wants a piece of the pie too with new partner codes indicating its working on a cloud gaming service for its Steam platform to make it a reality.</p>
      <p>Spotted <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/0947d1270f23b2c8aa495807022381ba38ed1964#diff-7641e3f4688e6136d56f495b7259c943">on GitHub</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1192017645765382144?s=20">Steam Database's Twitter</a>, 22 new files containing partner codes have been added to GitHub suggesting something called 'Steam Cloud Gaming' is being worked on.</p>

      <p>The codes contain references to game developers needing to agree "terms in the Steam Cloud Gaming Addendum before continuing". While Steam has yet to publicly confirm anything about an upcoming cloud service for its massive library, it would follow a trend in announcements from <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/10/google-stadia-still-has-no-australian-release-date/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/09/microsofts-project-xcloud-game-streaming-service-will-begin-public-testing-in-october/">Microsoft</a> regarding their upcoming Stadia and xCloud platforms.</p>

      <p>Steam already has a number of cloud-based offerings such as as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about/">Steam Link</a>, now software-only after initially coming as hardware, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay/">Steam Remote Play</a> but it's yet to offer an alternative option that doesn't require using your PC acting as a conduit to stream the titles.</p>
      <p>Kotaku Australia has reached out to Steam to confirm whether it's got a cloud gaming service in the works.</p>
