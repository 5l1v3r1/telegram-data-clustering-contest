Frozen's ""Let it go"" sung in Klingon
07 Nov 2019, 11:12 by Rusty Blazenhoff
Ever wonder what the song ""Let it go"" from Disney's hit movie Frozen would sound like in Klingon? Me neither but then again, something like that would never even occur to me. But it did occur to Jen Usellis, who performs as the Klingon Pop Warrior.
Listen as she belts out her Klingonese version, called ""yIbuSQo'"":



Nerdist:
After Reddit user staq16 posted the song to Reddit’s Star Trek subreddit earlier this month, the track quickly earned mad parmaq from the forum’s community. However, while most users thought the song was on point, some took issue with the fact that Klingons are known for not enjoying the cold—nor letting things go. They also apparently don’t do a lot of other things.
