被網友抓包拍床戲有「反應」　楊子儀力駁：有反應很合理

三立《天之蕉子》本週五進入精彩大結局，男、女主角楊子儀、吳怡霈歷經多重波折後，最終苦盡甘來，還給吳怡霈一個久違的婚禮。此外，楊子儀還針對之前被網友抓包，與吳怡霈的親熱床戲疑似有生理反應而做出回應，直言：「有反應才正常！」
本週《天之蕉子》將播出完結篇，女主角吳怡霈回想拍戲到殺青的半年多以來，最難忘的一場戲是剛開拍沒多久，那場掉下溪邊的落水戲，她說現在回想起來還是有點心驚膽顫，殺青到現在仍不敢去河邊和溪邊。吳怡霈回憶起那條溪非常地臭，想到當時腳踩在河裡的泥濘上的那種觸感，就覺得很可怕，況且雖然拍落水戲有吊鋼絲，但當要從橋上飛落溪邊的瞬間，如果沒有楊子儀抓住她的話，她的頭已經撞到橋墩，而兩人也因為這場戲開始變熟。
吳怡霈很感謝楊子儀在這部戲很幫忙她也很保護她，由於兩人都是主持人出身，因此楊子儀很能了解她的不安，甚至還會主動去跟導演、攝影師溝通可不可以不要讓她發現鏡頭，讓她可以有更自然的表現，令吳怡霈很感動。
讓吳怡霈哭最慘的是劇中妹妹楊小黎死掉的那場戲，她整整哭了200分鐘，哭完後眼睛腫到不行，還冰敷了1個小時，吳怡霈笑說隔天早上眼睛睜開以為鬼遮眼，因為眼睛完全無法睜開，還說自己就算失戀也沒哭過200分鐘。


對於日前被網友懷疑拍床戲產生「反應」，楊子儀認為「很合理」。

拍攝結婚戲時，吳怡霈從梳化開始就很多人搶著幫忙側拍，自己也在跟楊子儀討論以後結婚想穿什麼禮服，因為現場營造出唯美的氛圍，當下真的有想結婚的喜悅跟衝動。不同於甜美外表，吳怡霈是一個不按牌理出牌的人，對於自己的婚紗風格沒有設限，但不愛露胸，因此劇中的婚紗正巧就是吳怡霈喜歡的婚紗風格。
楊子儀談到他之前與和吳怡霈有一場親熱床戲，被網友懷疑有生理反應，而在戲最後一集楊子儀也終於站出來說清楚講明白，他表示自己也不能確定當時的反應，從手機看好像真的有反應，從電視看又像是褲子拉鍊沒喬好，這件事已成了一個謎，但在沒有造成對手演員困擾的前提下，那場戲散發的氛圍與狀態，「有反應是合理且成立的」。

Sanli's ""Tianzhijiazi"" entered the wonderful finale this Friday. After the multiple twists and turns, the male and female protagonists Yang Ziyi and Wu Yizhen finally gave up their efforts and gave Wu Yizhen a long-lost wedding. In addition, Yang Ziyi also responded to the fact that he was caught by netizens and had a physiological reaction with Wu Yizhen’s intimate bed, and bluntly said: ""There is a reaction to be normal!""
This week, ""The Seeds of Heaven"" will be aired, and the heroine Wu Yizhen recalls that she has been filming for more than half a year. The most memorable scene is that it hasn’t been long before the filming, and that she fell off the stream, she said now It still has a bit of horror, and I still dare not go to the river and the stream until now. Wu Yizhen recalled that the stream was very stinky. I thought it was terrible when I thought of the touch on the mud in the river. Besides, although I had a hanging wire, I had to fly from the bridge to the stream. In an instant, if Yang Ziyi did not catch her, her head had already hit the pier, and the two began to mature because of the play.
Wu Yizheng is very grateful to Yang Ziyi for helping her in this play. She also protects her. Because both of them are hostesses, Yang Ziyi can understand her uneasiness and even take the initiative to communicate with the director and photographer. Can you not let her The discovery of the lens allowed her to have a more natural performance, which made Wu Yizhen very moved.
The worst thing for Wu Yizhen to cry is the scene where her sister Yang Xiaoli died. She cried for 200 minutes. After she was crying, her eyes were swollen and she couldn’t do it. It was iced for an hour. Wu Yixiao said that her eyes opened the next morning. I thought that the ghost was covering my eyes, because my eyes couldn’t be opened at all, and I said that I didn’t cry for 200 minutes even if I fell in love.


Yang Ziyi thinks that ""it is very reasonable"" for a ""response"" that was suspected of being hit by a netizen.

When filming the wedding scene, Wu Yizhen started to comb and began to help others to shoot. He also discussed with Yang Ziyi what dress he would like to wear after the wedding, because the scene created a beautiful atmosphere, and now there is really the joy and impulsiveness of wanting to get married. . Unlike the sweet appearance, Wu Yizhen is a person who does not press the cards. There is no limit on the style of her wedding dress, but she does not like to show her breasts. Therefore, the wedding dress in the play happens to be the wedding style that Wu Yizhen likes.
Yang Ziyi said that he had a intimate bed scene with Wu Yizhen before, and he was suspected of having a physiological reaction. In the last episode of the show, Yang Ziyi finally stood up and made it clear that he could not confirm the reaction at that time. Really reacting, from the TV, it’s like a zipper zipper, no Joe. This has become a mystery. But without the trouble of the opponent’s actors, the atmosphere and state of the show, “There is a reaction. Reasonable and established.""
