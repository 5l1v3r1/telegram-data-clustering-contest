      <p>Highly rated Scottish MMA prospect Chris Duncan has signed a multi-fight deal with Bellator, joining MXP team mate Robert Whiteford and the Scottish Hit Squad’s Chris Bungard on the MMA giant’s roster.</p>
      <p>Duncan, 26, is the current Ultimate Fight League lightweight champion and boasts a perfect professional record of five wins - all ending by stoppage – which includes a first round KO win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ufc">UFC</a> icon <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>’s team mate Sam Slater in Dublin earlier this year.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>can exclusively reveal that with the contract he was waiting for in the bag, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tullibody">Tullibody</a> based fighter is ready to make major waves in the Bellator lightweight division.</p>
      <p>Duncan said: ”I’m delighted to have signed this contract and I’m looking forward to having the opportunity to get out there in front of the cameras and show everyone what I can do on the world stage.</p>
      <p>“I got some experience of fighting for Bellator earlier this year in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> where I knocked out Sam Slater in the first round. Bellator got to know who I was after that fight and they will know me even better after I knock out the others they put in front of me.</p>

      <p>“Fighting is something that is deep, deep within me. It is in my blood and I am more than ready to take advantage of this opportunity. I was telling my coach the other day that I feel I was born in the wrong era. </p>
      <p>"I just love being in the trenches ready for war and should probably have lived during the days of Vikings and Gladiators. I want to be a modern day Gladiator”.</p>
      <p>Duncan hasn’t been added to any fight card just yet but expects his debut to be sooner rather than later. He said: “I think it will probably be early next year before I get to make my debut but I’m always training so if the opportunity to fight earlier than that comes up I’m ready to go.</p>
      <p>“I’m never really out of shape and feel like I can go five rounds right the way through any training camp. I only use the last six weeks of a fight camp to sharpen up the tools and get some heavy sparring in so I will fight whoever they give me and whenever they want.</p>
      <p>“Bellator have signed me to fight so show me a guy and I will go in there and perform. That is my job; it’s as simple as that.  If you don’t do your job you don’t get paid.</p>
      <p>“So make no mistake, I will be the employee of the month for Bellator. Watch this space”. </p>
