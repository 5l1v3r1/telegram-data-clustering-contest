The ‘Don’t Extradite Assange’ event took place at 6pm outside the Home Office on Tuesday (November 5).
Before the event, M.I.A. tweeted: “Once Upon a time there were men with beards… B 4 the bearded guys there were someone else I can’t remember / Now it’s Russians / Later it could be u or me / I’m here for whatever sets truth free / Coz Jesus loves me. /Amen.”
In response to a fan who asked “Are you gonna sing M.I.A?” the singer, real name Mathangi Arulpragasam, replied “Yez, u coming?” M.I.A. performed at the event alongside Lowkey.
Now, M.I.A. has shard footage from the event and has thanked fans who attended the event. M.I.A. wrote: “Thanks you for everyone who turned up and helped out last night you bought the sunshine out today.” M.I.A also thanked Vivienne Westwood who designed her a “secrecy veil” to wear for the event.















Earlier this year (April 11), Assange was arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he had been claiming refuge for the last seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped.
He was then found guilty of failing to surrender to the court while facing US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets. He was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for a bail violation, while fighting extradition to the United States.
Back in 2017, M.I.A. wrote a letter in support of Assange urging people to “thank” the Wikileaks founder and saying the world should “fast fix your system not hide him or the cracks he exposed.” Assange is a long-term friend of the rapper.
The British-Sri Lankan rapper has used her politically charged music to explore life as a refugee across five albums and two EPs in her 20-year career and was awarded the MBE for services to music in this year’s New Year’s Honours List.
NME has contacted representatives of M.I.A for comment.
