Satoshi Nakaboto: ‘China will no longer crack down on Bitcoin mining’
07 Nov 2019, 09:30 by Satoshi Nakaboto

Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Machiavelli used to say: Fight the power!
Bitcoin Price
We closed the day, November 6 2019, at a price of $9,360. That’s a minor 0.21 percent increase in 24 hours, or $20. It was the highest closing price in one day.
We’re still 53 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).
Bitcoin market cap
Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $168,806,151,583. It now commands 67 percent of the total crypto market.
Bitcoin volume
Yesterday’s volume of $23,133,895,765 was the lowest in two days, 45 percent above the year’s average, and 48 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 484 tons of gold.
Bitcoin transactions
A total of 314,566 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 5 percent below the year’s average and 30 percent below the year’s high.
Bitcoin transaction fee
Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.54. That’s $3.17 below the year’s high of $3.71.
Bitcoin distribution by address
As of now, there are 13,289 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 4.9 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.
Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin
With a market capitalization of $168 billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.
Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million
On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.
He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 92.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $130,925 by now, according to dickline.info.
Bitcoin on Twitter
Yesterday 17,193 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 7.3 percent below the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.
Most popular posts about Bitcoin
This was yesterday’s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:



This was yesterday’s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:
When you tell r/IRS that bitcoin is beyond seizure. from r/Bitcoin
And this was yesterday’s top submission on Hacker News about Bitcoin:

One Tether Trader Didn’t Cause the Bitcoin Bubble (bloomberg.com)
