      <h1>Changing times: Market leaders and investor groups call for shorter working day on trading floors</h1>

      <p>The daily bustle on Europe’s high-octane trading floors should be cut short by more than an hour in a bid to improve mental health and diversity, two of the financial industry’s most influential bodies have urged this morning.</p>
      <p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said it will begin a formal consultation looking at working hours after receiving a letter from the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) and the Investment Association (IA) calling for a 90-minute reduction to the day.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Long hours are impacting on traders’ mental health and wellbeing, the bodies warned, adding that a shortened day would help recruit and retain employees with families.</p>
      <p>Calls for greater diversity on the trading floors come amid a wider push to improve the City’s culture, which has faced fresh scrutiny in recent months following misconduct allegations in financial sectors such as insurance and banking.</p>
      <p>April Day, head of equities at AFME, warned that “equities trading risks lagging behind a wider financial services industry push for more diversity and inclusion unless the long trading day is tackled by an industry-wide approach”.</p>

      <p>However, today’s call has been met with mixed reaction from traders in the City.</p>
      <p>The boss of one of Britain’s largest stockbrokers told <i>City A.M.</i>: “I just don’t know whether this is practical in the international world that we’re living now. People always get in the office from 7am too, so would this really make a difference?”</p>
      <p>They said: “Making the period shorter could also mean less profit as there would be less time for activity”.</p>
      <p>Another added: “I agree with the point that we need a more diverse workforce, but if you take off 90 minutes to the trading side of business, it won’t solve much.</p>
      <p>“If anything, its worse on the IB (investment banking) side because the total hours are longer.”</p>
      <p>City commentator David Buik said: “I doubt very much that women would care to have allowances made for them due to their domestic commitments. I think they might be appalled!</p>
      <p>“Markets are never, ever shut to accommodate anyone for any reason. Frankly if you live by the sword you must be prepared to die by it.”</p>
