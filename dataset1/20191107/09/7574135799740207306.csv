British electronic vets Cinematic Orchestra released their fifth studio album and first in twelve years, To Believe, earlier this year on Ninja Tune (ft. Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, and more), and they’ve been out on their first North American tour in over ten years this fall. They stopped in NYC on Tuesday night (11/5) for a show that brought out die hard fans who’d been waiting years to see the band in person. Joined by frequent collaborator, London vocalist Heidi Vogel, Cinematic Orchestra delivered a gorgeous show with beautiful melodies given an almost jazzy vibe by their saxophone player. Check out pictures from the night in the gallery above.—
