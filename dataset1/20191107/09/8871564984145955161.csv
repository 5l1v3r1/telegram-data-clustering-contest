The Luciano Pavarotti Foundation & Anggun in Concert





The Embassy of Italy and the Italian Cultural Institute (Istituto Italiano di Cultura), in collaboration with Aula Simfonia Jakarta, is hosting The Luciano Pavarotti Foundation & Anggun in Concert on Saturday. The concert is part of a series of events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Italy and Indonesia.
The late Luciano Pavarotti (1935-2007) was an Italian operatic tenor who, due to his crossover into popular music, became one of the most renowned and commercially successful tenors of all time. This concert will revisit the Maestro’s philosophy, which melds together modern and operatic classical music, that will be performed by the artists of The Pavarotti Foundation.
The show’s highlight will be the virtual duet between Indonesian-born French singer Anggun C. Sasmi and Pavarotti, a repeat of the performance on the finale of Asia’s Got Talent in April this year.

Saturday, Nov 9 at Aula Simfonia Jakarta, Kemayoran, Central Jakarta, from 5pm onwards. Tickets are available through Aula Simfonia’s ticket box at +6221 6586 7808, +628777 100 2009, or email: boxoffice@aulasimfoniajakarta.com.



Romantic Intimate Concert with Brian McFadden





This weekend, enjoy a romantic evening with Brian McFadden, the former member of the Irish boyband Westlife. He will be performing your favorite Westlife hits from the noughties in what promises to be a nostalgia-filled evening. If you were (or still are) a fan of McFadden, you might not want to miss the chance to meet him in person in the meet-and-greet session.

Saturday, Nov 9 at WHIZ Prime Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, from 8pm-10pm.
