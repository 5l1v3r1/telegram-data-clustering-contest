      <p>Preston's head of recruitment Joe Savage is on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SouthamptonFc">Southampton</a>'s radar as they search for a new sporting director.</p>
      <p>Hearts are also taking an interest after Savage's impressive work at Deepdale.</p>
      <p>North End have one of the smallest budgets in the Sky Bet Championship but are second in the table, two points behind leaders West Brom.</p>
      <p>Savage joined Preston in 2017, following boss Alex Neil to Deepdale after the pair worked together at Norwich and Hamilton.</p>
      <p>He was chief scout at Carrow Road for two years having been director of recruitment and analysis at Hamilton.</p>
      <p>Boss Neil has also been in demand with Preston rejecting Stoke's request to speak to the Scot at the weekend.</p>
      <p>They reported the Potters to the EFL for an illegal approach before withdrawing the complaint.</p>
      <p>Southampton are looking for a new sporting director to replace Ross Wilson after he moved to Rangers last month.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old helped bring boss Ralph Hasenhuttl to St Mary's last December following the departure of Mark Hughes.</p>
      <p>The Saints are 18th in the Premier League having suffered a record 9-0 defeat to Leicester two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Managerless Hearts, who sacked Craig Levein last week, are looking to create a sole post for a sporting director.</p>
      <p>Owner Ann Budge is reorganising the structure of the club, who sit second bottom of the Ladbrokes Premiership, with Levein having also acted as director of football.</p>
