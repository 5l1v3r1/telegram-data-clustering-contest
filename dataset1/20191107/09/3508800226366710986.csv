推動社會「善的循環」，加入自立共好平台，用你的專業幫助公益團體
07 Nov 2019, 09:17 by 廣編企劃


我們想讓你知道的是公益團體常因人力與技術問題而難以維運，為使公益團體自立成長，和德文教基金會推動「自立共好平台」，希望號召具有餐飲專長的個人或餐飲領域的企業，一起創新公益模式。



一路向上，爬過蜿蜒曲折的盤山路，一個彎轉過一個彎，山壁險峻，產業道路不斷彎曲而上，路面在崇山峻岭中迴旋俯仰，再過一條逕流小溪才能到達南投信義鄉的陳有蘭中心。

「我印象最深刻的，就是那一路向上彎曲的道路，過了溪水、進入深山，在教室裡， 我坐在小小的課桌椅旁，看著孩子們就著燈光寫著功課，很心疼。」頂新和德文教基金會創辦人魏應充回憶起，那一次他親自到南投信義鄉的陳有蘭中心，看著博幼基金會課輔班的孩童努力地一筆一筆寫著作業，那次造訪令他印象深刻，也讓他下定決心，投入深耕偏鄉課輔班的志業，後續也在彰化的永靖鄉開設課輔班。



與其接受恩惠，不如學習自立，改寫未來
頂新和德文教基金會從2017年開始，以飲食為經、以公益為緯，聚焦「食公益」捐助，隔年更設立「食公益慈善捐助辦法」，期望透過定期捐助及實質行動支持的能量，幫助全臺灣公益團體創新成長與茁壯，持續提供弱勢族群優質服務，啟發善與愛的能量，建構友好、互信、向善的社會，成就「共好」臺灣。
食公益捐助每年舉行兩次徵選，至今共服務了五十三個公益慈善團體，而博幼基金會就是其中之一。這些年來，食公益持續幫助在第一線服務的社福團體，期許能成為公益團體的最佳後盾，讓他們有更多能量，持續幫助身心障礙朋友、獨居老人、偏鄉孩童；這些受助者不只生活得到照顧、獲得愛與關懷，甚至有開創事業翻轉未來的可能。

但魏應充也發現，「捐助」雖然能提供最直接的協助，公益團體卻常因人力不足、技術力不佳，很難靠著自己的力量持續地長期營運；善款捐助只能解一時燃眉之急，卻無法讓公益團體建立永續經營模式。「自立共好，才是社福公益的最終目標。」魏應充語氣堅定地說道。
祖訓中的善念生生不息：「積善之家，必有垂裕。」
1826年，魏家祖先，魏儉正自汀州府永定縣渡海來台，至彰化縣武西保永靖街開墾，1885年興建永靖魏成美公堂，也就是現今頂新集團魏家的古厝。「『積善之家，必有垂裕。』魏家的祖訓，我時時刻刻謹記著，魏家子女從小就學習慈悲，也是我們自始自終堅持的理念。」

也因此，基金會決定設立「自立共好平台」，要以「成人之美」，一起「成就共好」。透過基金會一系列資源投注與深入輔導，幫助公益團體與其服務之個案，獲得能量邁向「自立」，公益團體能反思傳統服務思維，發展創新服務內容，建立永續經營模式，擴大服務能量協助更多族群；服務個案獲得支持，努力重返社會，扭轉現有，翻轉未來。
好比是，高雄的「一勾堂咖啡烘焙坊」，由頂新和德提供烘培技職教育與師資顧問輔導、飛揚協會開設營運，店裡工作人員來自弱勢家庭裡的青少年，對於烘焙技術、門市管理、前場服務等技術與知識皆不純熟，「餐飲業是我們熱愛的領域，如果能有業界的專業師傅協助輔導，就能創造更高的社會價值，產生善的循環。」

自立共好平台的第一步，就是募集「餐飲業師志工」，廣邀擁有餐飲知識（如中式麵點、西式點心、烘焙產品等）的業界師傅擔任業師志工，教導與陪伴公益團體的庇護工場或是烘焙坊等事業單位，協助檢視現有產品、生產流程簡化、通路市場開拓、餐點製作教學、新產品開發等專業幫助。
而第二步則是「企業職缺」，從各「餐飲」領域之公司行號或餐廳等，提供相關職缺給參與此平台的公益團體，使身心障礙朋友、高關懷青少年有更多就業機會，讓他們能努力回到社會與一般職場，穩定就業、邁向自立。
加入自立共好平台，用你的專業成就社會共好的未來
「改變台灣的未來，不是靠少數人的努力，而是要影響更多的人一起做！」魏應充表示，這些微小而眾多的改變，就像在社會裡撒佈一顆又一顆「善的種子」，深入台灣社會各個角落，將金錢資助擴及資源分享、媒合，透過社會間的彼此互助互惠，讓善念延續、開花結果，持續不斷擴散下去。
如同魏應充從佛法悟出的道理：要幫助社會，除了錢財物資的「財布施」，還有以知識、技術、真理教化他人的「法布施」，以及讓人無所畏懼的「無畏施」。只要願意做，有力出力、有物資出物資，或許，開啟「善的循環」從來就不難。

Promote the ""circle of goodness"" in society, join the platform of self-reliance and help your public welfare groups with your profession
07 Nov 2019, 09:17 by Guangbian Planning


What we want you to know is that public interest groups are often difficult to transport due to human and technical problems. In order to enable non-profit organizations to grow up independently, and the German Culture and Education Foundation promotes a platform for self-reliance, it is hoped that individuals or catering areas with catering expertise will be called upon. Enterprises, together with innovative public welfare models.



All the way up, climbed the winding mountain road, a bend turned a corner, the mountain wall is steep, the industrial road is constantly curved, the road is swaying in the mountains, and then a runoff creek can reach Chen Youlan, Nanyi Xinyi Township. center.

""The most impressive thing about me is that the road that bends upwards, the river, the deep mountains, in the classroom, I sit next to the small desks and chairs, watching the children write their homework with lights, very distressed. Wei Yingchong, the founder of the Dingxin and German Cultural and Cultural Foundation, recalled that he personally went to the Chen Youlan Center in Xinyi Township, Nantou, and watched the children of the Bo's Foundation's supplementary class work hard to write a book, the visit order. He was impressed, and he also made up his mind to invest in the philanthropy of the suburban class, and to follow up in Yongjing Township in Changhua.



Instead of accepting favors, it is better to learn to be self-reliant and rewrite the future.
Since 2017, the Dingxin and German Culture and Education Foundation has focused on the “food charity” donation with the theme of diet and public welfare. The “Food Charity Donation Method” has been set up every other year, and the energy supported by regular donations and substantive actions is expected. To help all charitable groups in Taiwan to innovate and grow stronger, to continue to provide quality services to the disadvantaged, to inspire the energy of good and love, to build a society of friendship, mutual trust and goodness, and to achieve ""good"" Taiwan.
Food charity donations are held twice a year and have served a total of 53 charitable charities, and the Boyi Foundation is one of them. Over the years, the food charity has continued to help the social welfare groups in the first-line service, and hopes to become the best backing for the public welfare groups, so that they can have more energy and continue to help the physically and mentally handicapped friends, the elderly living alone, and the children in the hometown; Helpers not only take care of their lives, gain love and care, but even have the possibility to start a career and turn the future.

However, Wei Yingchong also found that although ""donation"" can provide the most direct assistance, public welfare groups often have limited manpower and poor technical skills, and it is difficult to rely on their own strength to continue to operate for a long time. The donation can only solve the urgent need. However, it is impossible for public interest groups to establish a sustainable business model. ""It is the ultimate goal of social welfare for self-reliance,"" Wei Ying said firmly.
The good thoughts in the ancestral training are endless: ""The house of goodness will have a good life.""
In 1826, the Wei family ancestors, Wei Yizheng from Tingzhou Prefecture Yongding County, crossed the sea to Taiwan, to Changhua County, Wuxi Baoyongjing Street, opened in 1885, Yongjing Wei Chengmei Gongtang, which is now the ancient family of the Wei Group. ""The house of goodness must have a dignity."" The ancestral training of the Wei family, I always remember that the children of Wei family learned compassion from an early age, and it is also our philosophy that we insisted on from beginning to end.""

Therefore, the Foundation decided to establish a ""self-reliant platform"", and to ""achieve a good together"" with ""the beauty of adults."" Through a series of resource betting and in-depth counseling by the Foundation, we can help the public welfare groups and their services to gain energy and become self-reliant. The public welfare groups can reflect on traditional service thinking, develop innovative service content, establish a sustainable business model, and expand service energy assistance. More ethnic groups; service cases receive support, strive to reintegrate into society, reverse existing ones, and flip the future.
For example, Kaohsiung’s “One Hooktang Coffee Bake Shop” is provided by Dingxin and Degi, and provides consulting services for teachers and teachers, and the Flying Association provides operations. The staff in the store are from young people in disadvantaged families. The technology and knowledge of store management and front-end services are not well-known. ""The catering industry is an area we love. If we can have professional teachers in the industry to assist in counseling, we can create higher social values and create a good cycle.""

The first step in self-reliance on the platform is to recruit “food and beverage industry volunteers” and invite industry masters with catering knowledge (such as Chinese noodles, western-style dim sum, bakery products, etc.) to volunteer and teach and accompany the public welfare groups. Institutions such as workshops and bakeries help to review professional products such as existing products, streamlined production processes, channel market development, meal production teaching, and new product development.
The second step is the ""business job vacancies"". From the company numbers or restaurants in the ""catering"" field, the relevant job vacancies are provided to the public welfare organizations participating in the platform, so that the physically and mentally handicapped friends and high-care young people have more employment. Opportunities, so that they can work hard to return to society and the general workplace, stabilize employment, and become self-reliant.
Join a platform of self-reliance and use your profession to achieve a better future for society
""To change the future of Taiwan is not to rely on the efforts of a few people, but to influence more people to do together!"" Wei Yingchong said that these tiny and numerous changes are like spreading one after another in the society. ""Seeds"", deep into all corners of Taiwanese society, will expand financial resources to share resources and mediation, and through mutual assistance and mutual benefit among the society, let the good thoughts continue and blossom, and continue to spread.
Just as Wei Yingchong realized from the Dharma: to help the society, in addition to the ""funding"" of money and materials, there is ""Fashion"" that educates others with knowledge, technology, and truth, and ""fearlessness"" that makes people fearless. As long as you are willing to do it, you can make a strong effort and have materials to make supplies. Perhaps it is not difficult to open a ""circle of goodness.""
