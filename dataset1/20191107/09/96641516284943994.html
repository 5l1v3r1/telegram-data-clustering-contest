      <h1>Sony's PlayStation leadership is changing again</h1>
      <h2>Guerilla Games co-founder will lead Sonyâ€™s first-party studios.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:31:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/rachel-england" target="_blank">Rachel England</a></address>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/08/the-playstation-5-launch-date-holiday-2020/">PlayStation 5</a> due next year, PlayStation is no doubt keen to get its ducks in a row. It's seen a number of managerial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/30/shawn-layden-leaves-sie-playstation/">changes</a> recently, and has now announced two new moves. Hermen Hulst, formerly of studio Guerilla, is now head of worldwide studios, tasked with making sure the PS5 has plenty of first-party blockbuster games on its roster. PlayStation veteran <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/17/an-intimate-chat-with-sony-playstation-shuhei-yoshida/">Shuhei Yoshida</a>, meanwhile, takes the helm of a new initiative to encourage more indies to the platform.</p>
      <p>Hulst co-founded Amsterdam-based Guerilla, best known for the <i>Killzone </i>franchise and <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-made-me-fall-in-love-with-open-world-rpgs/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. </i>Sony acquired Guerilla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005/12/07/sony-buys-killzone-developer-bungie-killer-imminent/">back in 2005</a>, and since then Hulst has been responsible for driving a number of innovations, including proprietary game engine Decima which has been used to produce a number of titles, among them the upcoming <i>Death Standing.</i></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Yoshida's new role will see him leading a new company initiative designed to support independent developers -- exactly what that looks like isn't clear yet, but Yoshida is well-known in the business for his love of indie games, and Sony could certainly use a boost in this area. Once a staunch backer of independent developers the company's foothold in this market <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/24/sony-xbox-devolver-indie-games-ps4-publishing-e3/?guccounter=1">has weakened in recent years</a> -- Yoshida's new position could turn this around.</p>
