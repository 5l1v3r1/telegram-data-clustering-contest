      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - The “E3” group of major West European countries that cooperated on Iran policy should be formalised after Britain’s planned departure from the European Union, German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer said that after Brexit, close cooperation with France and Germany should continue, creating an added security forum alongside the EU and NATO.</p>
      <p>“Brexit or not, the island won’t just sail away. It remains part of our security architecture,” she said in a speech in Munich. “I therefore propose that we make permanent the ‘E3-format’ that emerged around the Iran question.”</p>
      <p>Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Angela Merkel’s conservatives and widely seen as the Chancellor’s preferred successor, said a further meeting of the three countries’ defence ministers should take place later this year.</p>
