国行建议现金交易上限为2.5万
07 Nov 2019, 09:55 by Syahirah Syed Jaafar
（吉隆坡7日讯）国家银行提议，明年设定现金交易限制（CTL）为2万5000令吉，作为继续遏制金融犯罪举措的一部分。
现金交易限制是指每笔交易可以支付实际现金额度的上限。
国行指出，如果这项建议得以落实，超出建议限额的现金交易不能以现金支付，必须以电子方式或支票支付。任何企图规避这一限制的行为，付款人和收款人均属违法。
国行副总裁Datuk Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour在媒体汇报会上表示，该提议并非是新或独特的，因为许多其他国家已推行。
“鉴于现金交易的不可追踪性和匿名性质，令其成为非法活动的理想工具，因此需要落实CTL。”
他指出：“现金仍广泛受到非法活动的滥用。因此，这项措施针对被滥用风险较高的大额现金交易。这也不是为了妨碍合法的货物与服务现金支付，因大部分是小额物品。”
CTL将涵盖所有类型的现金支付交易，包括货物与服务，以及个人出于个人目的的捐赠或付款。
但Abdul Rasheed说，通过持牌银行、回教银行、货币兑换商或指定机构进行的交易则不受限制，因为已遵循严格的报告举措。
经财政部批准的人道主义和救灾等“紧急情况”的交易也将豁免。
“CTL是进一步加强大马反洗钱、反恐融资框架的一系列措施中的最新举措。”
他指出，这补充现有的诚信措施，如可疑交易报告（STR）和现金门槛报告（CTR），以更好地为当局提供进一步加强大马金融诚信的工具。
CTL符合现有CTR的2万5000令吉门槛。CTR从今年1月起，从原本的5万令吉，降至2万5000令吉。如果超出门槛，必须呈报。
CTL的公众咨询文件将于11月11日至12月31日在国行网站上发布，供公众在拟议政策实施前提交任何反馈。国行的目标是明年落实。
Abdul Rasheed补充：“公众可提供意见，并提出他们所担心的事项，无论是所设限额还是其他实践挑战。最终，确保遵守新的CTL是所有人的共同责任，以真正地打击任何不必要的活动。”
CTL是国家反洗钱协调委员会（NCC）提出的倡议，国行是秘书处。

Bank of China recommends a cash transaction limit of 25,000
07 Nov 2019, 09:55 by Syahirah Syed Jaafar
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): The National Bank proposes to set a cash transaction limit (CTL) of RM25,000 next year as part of its ongoing efforts to curb financial crime.
The cash transaction limit refers to the upper limit of the actual cash amount that can be paid for each transaction.
The Bank of China pointed out that if this proposal is implemented, cash transactions beyond the recommended limit cannot be paid in cash and must be paid electronically or by check. Any attempt to circumvent this restriction is illegal for both the payer and the payee.
Datuk Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour, vice president of Bank of China, said at the media briefing that the proposal was not new or unique because many other countries have implemented it.
“Given the untrackability and anonymity of cash transactions, making them an ideal tool for illegal activities, CTL needs to be implemented.”
He pointed out: ""Cash is still widely abused by illegal activities. Therefore, this measure is aimed at large-value cash transactions that are at higher risk of abuse. This is not to hinder the legal payment of cash for goods and services, because most of them are small items. """"
CTL will cover all types of cash payment transactions, including goods and services, as well as personal donations or payments for personal purposes.
But Abdul Rasheed said that transactions through licensed banks, Islamic banks, money changers or designated agencies are not restricted because strict reporting initiatives have been followed.
“Emergency” transactions such as humanitarian and disaster relief approved by the Ministry of Finance will also be waived.
“CTL is the latest in a series of measures to further strengthen Malaysia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework.”
He pointed out that this complements existing integrity measures, such as the Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) and the Cash Threshold Report (CTR), to better provide the authorities with tools to further strengthen Malaysia's financial integrity.
The CTL meets the existing CTR's RM25,000 threshold. Since January this year, CTR has dropped from RM50,000 to RM25,000. If the threshold is exceeded, it must be reported.
The CTL's public consultation document will be posted on the website of the Bank of China from November 11th to December 31st for public feedback before the proposed policy is implemented. The goal of the Bank of China is to implement it next year.
Abdul Rasheed added: “The public can provide advice and raise concerns about what they are worried about, whether it is a set limit or other practical challenges. Ultimately, ensuring compliance with the new CTL is a shared responsibility of all to truly combat any unnecessary activity.""
The CTL is an initiative of the National Anti-Money Laundering Coordination Committee (NCC), which is the Secretariat.
