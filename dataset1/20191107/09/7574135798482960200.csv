Dead & Co played 2 nights at Nassau Coliseum (videos, setlists)
07 Nov 2019, 09:35 by Nick Masi



After Dead & Company began their Fall Fun Run with a two-night stand at MSG that included a Robert Hunter tribute on night one (Halloween) and surprise guest Maggie Rogers on night two, they made their way to the nearby NYCB Live: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum for shows on Tuesday (11/5) and Wednesday (11/6). It doesn’t look like there were any major surprises at these, but they kept changing the setlists up and played plenty of favorites that were skipped at MSG. And at night two, they hung a tie-dye banner for all 44 times the Dead (including the real Grateful Dead and Dead & Co) played the Coliseum. Highlights included “St. Stephen” into “The Eleven” on night one, and “Help on the Way > Slipknot > Franklin’s Tower” on night two, and to my ears, they sounded better at these shows than they did all summer.
Check out the setlists and videos from both Coliseum shows below. Meanwhile, if you were at the Halloween show, did you happen to see Jimmy Fallon?
In other Grateful Dead news, Phil Lesh’s 80th birthday will be celebrated at Lockn’ 2020.
