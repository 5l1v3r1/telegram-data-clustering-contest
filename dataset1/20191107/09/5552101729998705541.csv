兒子IKEA手淫謝罪　李興文竟讚「一個巨星的誕生」
07 Nov 2019, 09:23 by 娛樂組
早先李興文因兒子荒唐夜闖IKEA，他先是代兒道歉，如今事主也上傳影片，「希望能夠與IKEA達成和解，並幫助扭轉形象，希望藉由此次的前車之鑑，不會再有任何人效法」。



之前自豪軍事化教育的李興文，結果兒子李堉睿為了拍片惹出是非，行徑頗屁孩，如今也用拍片致歉，但除了鞠躬認錯之外，也放上有關自己的新聞報導。
李堉睿道歉之後，坐上了李興文的車，父子前往公司開會；李堉睿還轉頭問李興文：「爸爸你知道怎麼樣跟他們講，就是介紹我嗎？」
只見李興文則回答：「你是一個潛力無窮的巨星。」李堉睿聽了超爽，並且看似信以為真地接說：「我是一個巨星，又是一個演員，又是一個嘻哈歌手。」整個過程看來，頗有之前吳宗憲、鹿希派的fu，順序大致都是先罵後捧。
回顧事發過後李興文寫下的千字長文，字句令人不捨：「我深切自責，並認為自己是一個教子無方的父親而感到慚愧！」如今態度丕變；李堉睿遭IKEA提告妨害風化，以及侵入建築物後，現則覺得自己仍是演員與嘻哈歌手，父子狀況似不太妙。

Son IKEA masturbation sins Li Xingwen praised ""the birth of a superstar""
07 Nov 2019, 09:23 by Entertainment Group
Earlier, Li Xingwen apologized for his son's ridiculous night IKEA. He first apologized to the child. Now the victim also uploaded a film. ""I hope to reach a settlement with IKEA and help reverse the image. I hope that no one will follow the example of this car."" .



Li Xingwen, who was previously proud of militarized education, said that his son Li Yurui had provoked the right and wrong for filming. He now apologizes for taking pictures, but in addition to admitting his mistakes, he also puts his own news reports.
After Li Haorui apologized, he took Li Xingwen's car and his father and son went to the company for a meeting. Li Ruirui also turned to Li Xingwen: ""Dad, do you know how to tell them, is it to introduce me?""
I saw Li Xingwen replied: ""You are a superstar with great potential."" Li Haorui listened to super cool, and seemed to believe that he said: ""I am a superstar, an actor, and a hip-hop singer."" It seems that there are quite a few fus before Wu Zongxian and Lu Xipai.
Looking back at the thousand-character long text written by Li Xingwen after the incident, the words are reluctant: ""I feel deeply guilty and think that I am a father who has no way to teach the son!"" Now the attitude has changed; Li Yirui has been slammed by IKEA. After invading the building, I feel that I am still an actor and a hip hop singer. The father and son are not very good.
