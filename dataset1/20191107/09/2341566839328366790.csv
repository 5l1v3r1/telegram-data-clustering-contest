（中央社記者江今葉華盛頓6日專電）美國駐巴貝多大使館今天推文公布美台代表團在台灣友邦聖露西亞的考察畫面。據了解，這是美台首度籌組聯合商務考察團前往台灣友邦考察投資環境，希望能協助台灣鞏固邦交。
美國駐巴貝多大使館官方推特（Twitter）發布訊息指出，美台代表團訪問台灣在加勒比海友邦聖露西亞，以促進民間部門投資。
照片中除了有台灣駐聖露西亞大使沈正宗外，還有世界銀行（World Bank）美籍代理執行董事貝特爾（Erik Bethel）、聖露西亞官員查爾斯（Nancy Charles）、美國國務院首席競爭官強斯敦（Corey Johnston）等人一同參觀美國企業投資的工廠。推文還加註「美國加勒比海2020」（#USCaribbean2020）。



涉外人士指出，這是台美首度籌組聯合商務考察團考察台灣友邦，了解當地投資與經商環境，未來希望美台與邦交國的往來能由援助轉為更具積極性的投資，協助台灣鞏固邦交。
在索羅門群島與吉里巴斯於9月相繼與台灣斷交、轉向中國之後，台灣剩15個邦交國。
儘管台灣國際空間遭到中國擠壓，美國行政與立法部門對台灣的支持力道反而更為加強。除了「台北法案」正在美國國會審議，助台灣鞏固邦交外，美國行政部門近來也積極與台灣合作，希望促進台美與台灣邦交國間的三邊關係。
日前外交部政務次長徐斯儉抵達華府與美國國務院主管亞太事務助理國務卿史達偉（David Stilwell）的會晤，美方罕見主動公開行程，兩人也談到未來在台灣邦交國的合作意向。
美國國務院西半球事務局代理助卿柯札克（Michael Kozak）日前於推特上公布與駐美代表高碩泰、美國國務院亞太事務副助卿費德瑋（Jonathan Fritz），以及聖露西亞總理查士納（Allen Chastanet）在內的7個台灣友邦部長級以上官員，在華府召開會議的照片。這場會談主要是討論強化與台灣在西半球友邦國家合作。（編輯：馮昭）1081107

(Central News Agency reporter Jiang Jinye, Washington, 6th) The US Embassy in Barbados today tweeted the picture of the US-Taiwan delegation's visit to Taiwan's friendly state, St. Lucia. It is understood that this is the first time that the United States and Taiwan have organized a joint business delegation to Taiwan to investigate the investment environment, hoping to help Taiwan consolidate diplomatic relations.
The official US Embassy in Barbados issued a message stating that the US-Taiwan delegation visited Taiwan in the Caribbean, St. Lucia, to promote private sector investment.
In addition to Taiwan’s Ambassador to St. Lucia, Shen Zhengzong, there are also World Bank’s American Acting Executive Director Erik Bethel, St. Lucia’s official Nancy Charles, and US State Department Chief Competitive Officer. Corey Johnston and others visited the factories invested by American companies. The tweet also added ""US Caribbean 2020"" (#USCaribbean2020).



Foreigners pointed out that this is the first time that Taiwan and the United States have organized a joint business delegation to visit Taiwan's friends and understand the local investment and business environment. In the future, we hope that the exchanges between the US and Taiwan and the diplomatic relations can be turned from aid to more active investment to help Taiwan consolidate. diplomatic relations.
After the Solomon Islands and Kiribati broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in September and turned to China, Taiwan left 15 states to pay.
Although Taiwan’s international space has been squeezed by China, the US administration and legislative departments have strengthened their support for Taiwan. In addition to the ""Taipei Act"" being reviewed by the US Congress to help Taiwan consolidate diplomatic relations, the US administration has recently actively cooperated with Taiwan and hopes to promote the trilateral relations between Taiwan and the United States and Taiwan.
Recently, Xu Sijun, the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Washington to meet with US State Department Assistant Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific Affairs David Stilwell. The US side rarely took the initiative to publicly travel. The two also talked about the future cooperation intentions in Taiwan.
Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary of the Western Hemisphere Bureau of the US State Department, recently announced on Twitter that Gao Shuotai, a representative of the United States, Jonathan Fritz, the US Department of State for Asia Pacific, and St. Lucia’s Prime Minister, Chatner (Allen Chastanet), seven Taiwanese friends and ministers above the ministerial level, held a photo of the meeting in Washington.
