      <h1>Hong Kong Startup Launches LSE-Powered Bitcoin Spot, Futures Platform</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:17:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:17</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Hong Kong-based Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) spot and derivatives exchange Atom Group has launched amid a tightening of the region’s crypto-regulatory regime.</p>
      <p>As the South China Morning Post (SCMP) <a href="https://www.scmp.com/print/business/companies/article/3036674/blockchain-start-aax-expects-crypto-exchange-hong-kong-stay">reported</a> on Nov. 7, the Atom Asset Exchange (AAX) uses the Millenium Exchange matching engine developed by the London Stock Exchange and promises prospective clients lower trade latency and trade data transparency.</p>
      <h3>SFC brings security tokens and crypto futures under its remit</h3>
      <p>AAX’s launch comes just one day after Hong Kong’s securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-regulator-to-unveil-new-cryptocurrency-exchange-rules">released</a> new guidance for domestic <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> exchanges. </p>
      <p>The watchdog has indicated that cryptocurrency trading related to security offering or futures contracts will henceforth come under its remit as a regulated activity — an announcement whose significance has been <a href="https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1192153493877882880?s=20">underscored</a> by industry commentator Dovey Wan, a founding partner of blockchain investment firm Primitive Ventures.</p>
      <p>In its guidance, the SFC stated that a license or authorization would be required for cryptocurrency futures products unless an exemption applies. It outlined:</p>
      <blockquote>“Hong Kong hosts dozens of virtual asset trading platforms which pose serious investor protection concerns. A number of these may decide not to seek an SFC license under the new regulatory framework. This is a course of action which is open to them simply by ensuring that no virtual asset traded on their platforms is a ‘security’ or ‘futures contract.’”</blockquote>
      <p>As SCMP notes, the SFC’s chief executive Ashley Alder has stressed this week that certain crypto futures or derivatives contracts that offer high leverage pose high risks and could potentially be deemed illegal in the region.</p>
      <h3>AAX bets on a regulated future</h3>
      <p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-barely-any-hong-kong-crypto-funds-being-approved-for-licenses">covered</a> earlier this week, a fresh report has alleged that the SFC’s licensing regime for cryptocurrency fund managers — introduced back in Oct. 2018 — has resulted in just one confirmed approval to date. </p>
      <p>This March, the SFC <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kongs-securities-regulator-issues-detailed-guidance-for-security-token-offerings">released</a> regulatory guidelines for Security Token Offerings, indicating that security tokens are likely to be classified as securities under Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Ordinance, and thus fall under existing securities laws.</p>
