      <h1>Russian, regime strikes kill eight civilians in NW Syria: Observatory for Human Rights</h1>

      <p><b>AL-SAHAARA, SYRIA: </b>Air strikes by the Syrian regime and its ally Russia killed eight civilians in an embattled anti-government bastion in northwestern Syria Wednesday, a Britain-based war monitor said.</p>
      <p>A Russian strike killed seven civilians and wounded at least 20 others in an attack in the village of Al-Sahaara in the enclave of Idlib, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>
      <p>At the site, an <i>AFP</i> correspondent saw a rescue worker carry the limp body of a tiny girl away from the rubble, her clothes blanketed in fine dust.</p>

      <p>Bright red blood had gathered around her throat and, under a crop of dusty hair, her eyes were closed.</p>
      <p>Another emergency worker stood with a body bag at his feet, as colleagues in white hard hats sprayed water onto a building partially pummelled to grey rubble.</p>
      <p>Another civilian was later killed in a regime strike in the town of Jisr al-Shughur in the west of Idlib province, the <i>Observatory</i> said.</p>
      <p>Less than 30 kilometres away in the regime-held city of Aleppo, one civilian died and another was wounded in artillery fire by militants state news agency SANA reported, using the regime’s term for all armed opposition groups.</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s Russian strike was the second of its kind in less than a week, the Observatory said, after a Russian raid on the village of Jabala on Saturday killed six civilians, including one child.</p>
      <p>The monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria, says it determines who carries out an air strike according to flight patterns, as well as aircraft and the munitions involved.</p>
      <p>The Idlib region, which is home to some three million people including many displaced by Syria’s eight-year civil war, is controlled by the country’s former al-Qaeda affiliate.</p>
      <p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces launched a blistering military campaign against Idlib in April, killing around 1,000 civilians and displacing more than 400,000 people from their homes.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire announced by the regime’s major backer Moscow has largely held since late August, although the Observatory says skirmishes have persisted.</p>

      <p>Assad last month said Idlib was the main front standing in the way of an end to the civil war, as his forces made a partial comeback in northeast Syria to stave off a Turkish offensive against Kurdish fighters there.</p>
      <p>The Damascus regime had gained back large swathes of Syria from rebels in the past four years since Moscow intervened militarily by its side.</p>
      <p>Syria’s war has killed 370,000 people and displaced millions from their homes since beginning in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-Assad protests.</p>
