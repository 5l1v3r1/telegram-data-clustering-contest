      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Southern Kings</b> have flown in replacements ahead of their final PRO14 tour game against Welsh side Ospreys in Swansea on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Kings have lost their captain <b>JC Astle</b> to an upper respiratory infection, with the lock returning home, while tighthead <b>Rossouw de Klerk</b> has an ankle injury and will also return home.</p>
      <p>The Kings will be flying in veteran scrumhalf <b>Sarel Pretorius</b> and former SA Schools tighthead <b>Lupumlo Mguca </b>as replacements for the last game of the tour.</p>
      <p>"Sarel wasn't fully fit before, and was struggling with a calf strain, but he brings a certain amount of experience for us," Kings coach Rob Kempson said.</p>
      <p>The Kings have also rested flanker <b>Tienie Burger </b>from training this week to cope with the workload he has put in.</p>
      <p>"Tienie put in tremendous work in the last game, so we will be keeping him a bit on the sidelines to</p>
      <p>make sure he recovers and is ready for the next game," Kempson added.</p>
      <p>Saturday's clash is scheduled for 17:00 (SA time).</p>
