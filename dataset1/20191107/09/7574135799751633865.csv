07 Nov 2019, 09:09 by Andrew Sacher



Pete Davidson, who’s back to regularly appearing on SNL, has added an appearance at the final day of New York Comedy Festival, which is underway now. He’ll be one of the guests on Triumph The Insult Comic Dog‘s new quiz show and podcast, Let’s Make A Poop. In addition to Pete, it’ll feature Anthony Scaramucci (or as you may know him, The Mooch), Lawrence O’Donnell, and a “special mystery guest to poop on” (yes you read that right).
It’s billed as an “insult-packed game show, with celebrity panelists playing for charity and humiliation,” and it goes down at the Murmrr Ballroom on Sunday (11/10) at 9 PM. Tickets are on sale now with proceeds going to charity.
As for Pete Davidson, he also has upcoming shows in Portland and Chicago this month. SNL resumes November 16 with Harry Styles as host and musical guest.
