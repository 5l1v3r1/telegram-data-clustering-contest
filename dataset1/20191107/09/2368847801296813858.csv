07 Nov 2019, 09:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】韓國7日首次透過板門店遣送朝鮮居民。統一部發言人李相旻表示，政府下午將2名越界南下的凶殺案嫌犯驅逐出境。
韓聯社報導，韓國今天下午3時10分已將2人經由板門店遣送朝鮮。2人所乘坐的漁船8日將送還朝鮮。
李相旻表示，這2人都是20多歲的男性，涉嫌在東部海域北方限界線（NLL）附近海域殺害同一漁船上的16名船員後棄屍逃逸。
統一部人士透露，經調查後，這2人承認殺人棄屍，但是具體犯罪情況應由朝鮮深入調查。
韓國政府則表示，這2人涉嫌殺人重罪，不屬於政治犯和庇護對象，還可能對韓國公民的生命安全造成威脅，不能視為國際法上的難民，決定驅逐他們。
