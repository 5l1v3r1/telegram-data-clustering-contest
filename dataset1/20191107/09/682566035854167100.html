      <p>Cape Town - <b>Manchester United </b>striker <b>Marcus Rashford</b> is refusing to give up on a top-four finish, saying it's "nowhere near impossible".</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are 10th in the Premier League table after picking up just 13 points from their first 11 games, with Rashford scoring five goals in that time.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's troops have won only three games all season and defeats to Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Newcastle United and Bournemouth have put the pressure on the Norweigan.</p>
      <p>They are now ten points behind Leicester City and Chelsea who currently occupy third and fourth in the top flight.</p>
      <p>After drawing with Liverpool and beating Norwich, United looked to have found their rhythm, with Anthony Martial and Rashford causing problems.</p>
      <p>Martial and midfield ace Paul Pogba have struggled with injury problems all season but Rashford believes they will go close once they are all fit and ready to play.</p>
      <p>He told <i>Soccer Saturday</i>: "It's going to be tough (to get into the top four), but it's nowhere near impossible. We don't need to focus on any other teams; we play our best football when we focus on ourselves and us improving.</p>
      <p>"Old Trafford is a special place, and if we do that with the fans behind us, it's a tough place to come.</p>
      <p>"With the tempo, we play at when we're at our best, it's very hard to stop us so we use it as a template, and we need to get back to doing that."</p>
      <p>United will try to return to winning ways on Thursday when they take on Partizan in the Europa League group stage.</p>
      <p>The north-west giants can progress from Group L with a win on home soil before they then take on Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>After a two-week international break, they then face Sheffield United at Bramall Lane.</p>
