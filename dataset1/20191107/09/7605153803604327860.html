        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 7 – The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has warned voters in the ongoing Kibra mini-poll to adhere to secrecy of the ballot a violation of which is an electoral offence punishable in law.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement posted on its tweeter account on Thursday, the electoral body has warned those found to be violating the directive of dire consequences.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The warning by the Wafula Chebukati-led commission comes after a section of voters took to social media to post photographs depicting the candidates they voted for after casting their ballots.</p>
      <p>According to the IEBS Act, anyone found to be engaged in election malpractice is liable to fines or imprisonment depending on the offense committed.</p>
      <p>Two people have so far been arrested over suspicion of voter bribery.</p>
      <p>One person was arrested at Mashimoni Squatters polling centers after he was spotted by irate voters dishing out money to voters who were on the queue.</p>

      <p>Another was apprehended at the Old Kibra Primary polling center with the area residents claiming that he was spotted in various centers trying to dish out money.</p>
      <p>The two who will be arraigned in court to face charges are not registered voters in the area and are not agents to any of the contenders vying in the race, voters who spoke to the press said.</p>
      <p>Voters in began polling on Thursday morning to elect their representative in the National Assembly in a contest seen as a do or die for ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto.</p>
      <p>Polling centres opened at 6am and were expected to close by 6pm.</p>
      <p>Odinga’s ODM is fighting to retain the seat through its candidate Imran Okoth, the brother to late area MP Ken Okoth.</p>
      <p>Ruto on the other hand has been campaigning for the ruling Jubilee Party’s McDonald Mariga and is keen to win the constituency perceived as an opposition stronghold.</p>
      <p>There are 24 candidates and 118,658 registered voters.</p>
