        <b>These days, testing on track is extremely limited. One of the ways to test different set-ups, components and gather general data is to use a simulator. The simulator has improved over recent years and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> believes it has 95% realism. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>"That's why we practice a lot in the simulator,"</i> explains the Dutchman at The Rich Eisen Show. </p>

      <p>Verstappen suggests the only major thing missing from the simulator is the G-forces. <i>"I would say 95 percent, the missing five percent are the G-forces, because you cannot really replicate that in the simulator,"</i> Verstappen added. </p>
      <p>In modern F1, most of the important work is carried out even before a wheel is turned on track in the build-up to the race weekend. <i>“We ensure that the car is ready before we leave for the circuit because the run time there is very limited. Going more prepared is all the better because then you can really take steps during the weekend,"</i> says the Dutchman.</p>
