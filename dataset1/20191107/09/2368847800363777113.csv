陳思敏：全球反活摘領軍組織獲獎 中共恐慌

07 Nov 2019, 09:37

全球制止中共活摘器官罪行的領軍機構「醫生反對強制摘取器官組織」（簡稱DAFOH），因其針對中國良心犯被非法強制摘取器官的調查和調查結果，於週日（11月3日）獲頒「特蕾莎修女社會正義獎」簡稱DAFOH）11月3日獲頒「特蕾莎修女社會正義獎」（Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice）。
《印度時報》（The Indian Times）報導，DAFOH創辦人、執行主任托斯坦‧特雷（Torsten Trey）醫生在得獎感言中提到：「我們看到了一家中國醫院，該醫院每年進行2,000次肝移植。這個數字是令人難以置信的，尤其是在器官捐贈率較低的國家。」特雷醫生所稱這個到現在仍是令人難以置信的數據，其實曝光於13年前。
在2006年9月8日美國總統生物倫理委員會聽證會上，特雷醫生做專題演講時提到：（2006年）7月，我參加了在波士頓舉行的世界移植大會。我有幸與天津市的一名中國移植外科醫師交談。我們談到了肝移植。他說，他的醫院是天津市進行肝移植的三所醫院之一。他進一步說，僅在他的醫院，他們每年將進行2000次肝移植。相比之下，在整個德國，每年大約有700例肝臟移植；在阿根廷，每年只有200個。世界移植大會的許多與會者聽了他（中國天津醫師）的數據感到震驚。所以我想知道所有這些器官來自何處。Kilgour和Matas的最新報告是一項深入的調查，它提供了重要的數據，指出中共系統地從活著的法輪功修煉者身上摘取器官。
DAFOH正是成立於中共活摘黑幕曝光國際社會的2006年，並自此開始了迄今不輟的調查和研究。今年6月英國倫敦，DAFOH的調查結果得到了獨立人民法庭的支持，法庭宣判，中共強摘活體器官暴行猖獗，法輪功是主要來源，維族、藏人、基督徒也可能受害。
在特雷醫生與DAFOH成員醫生聯合發表學術論文《中共對法輪功的冷酷種族滅絕》中指出，中國器官移植行業的發展緊隨中共政權對法輪功的種族滅絕政策。DAFOH在2012年發起制止中共活摘器官全球聯署以來，全球50多個國家和地區超過300萬人簽署，已經成為世界歷史上最大的民事請願行動之一。而這項請願也作為DAFOH獲提名諾貝爾和平獎的大量貢獻之一。
DAFOH曾於2016年被提名諾貝爾和平獎，且DAFOH的提名是與中共強摘器官有關的第二個諾貝爾和平獎提名。第一個提名是2010年的兩位人權律師David Kilgour和David Matas。
醫學雜誌Croatian Medical Journal曾於2016年6月刊文介紹，DAFOH獲諾貝爾獎提名本身就是對其堅持醫學道德規範的肯定，儘管每年都有重大醫學進步獲得諾貝爾獎，但同等重要的醫學道德和人道主義方面受到的關注卻很少。DAFOH是唯一一家重點研究良心囚犯成為中共強摘器官主要目標人群的國際醫療組織。中國移植濫用的歷史，自2006年以來，越來越多的證據表明，良心犯被殺害後器官被摘取用於移植，法輪功是主要目標。
Croatian Medical Journal文章寫道，DAFOH這十年來的努力，旨在提高人們的認識並向醫學界和社會揭露不道德的器官摘除，尤其是中共強迫進行器官摘除的罪行，不僅是危害人類罪，而且對醫學普遍構成嚴重威脅。文章最後寫道，不能讓強摘器官這種濫用移植醫學的現象繼續存在，也不能對這種不道德行為保持沉默，如此才能使世界不再是「危險的生活場所」。這呼應文章開篇詞──愛因斯坦名言：我們居住的世界危險並不是人壞，而是因為人們沒有做任何事去改變。「The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.」
今次「醫生反強摘器官組織」DAFOH獲頒「特蕾莎修女社會正義獎」實至名歸，也令中共恐慌，因為正義必定戰勝邪惡。

Chen Simin: Global Anti-Resilience Leadership Organization Awards Panic

07 Nov 2019, 09:37

The global leader in the fight against the CCP's crime of organ harvesting, ""Doctors against forced organ harvesting"" (DAFOH), was investigated and investigated for illegally forcibly harvesting organs from Chinese conscience, on Sunday (November 3) The ""Teresa Social Justice Award"" (DAFOH) was awarded the ""Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice"" on November 3.
The Indian Times reported that Dr. Torsten Trey, founder and executive director of DAFOH, said in a speech: ""We saw a Chinese hospital that has 2,000 livers a year. Transplantation. This number is incredible, especially in countries with low organ donation rates."" Dr. Trey said this is still incredible data, and it was actually exposed 13 years ago.
At the hearing of the US President's Bioethics Committee on September 8, 2006, Dr. Trey said in a special speech: (2006) I participated in the World Transplant Conference in Boston. I had the privilege of talking to a Chinese transplant surgeon in Tianjin. We talked about liver transplantation. He said that his hospital is one of the three hospitals for liver transplantation in Tianjin. He further said that in his hospital alone, they will have 2,000 liver transplants per year. In contrast, there are approximately 700 liver transplants per year throughout Germany; in Argentina, there are only 200 livers per year. Many participants at the World Transplant Conference were shocked by the data of his (Tianjin, China). So I want to know where all these organs come from. The latest report by Kilgour and Matas is an in-depth survey that provides important data on the systematic removal of organs from living Falun Gong practitioners.
DAFOH was established in 2006, the CCP's live-harvest exposure to the international community, and has since started the investigation and research. In June of this year, the DAFOH survey was supported by the Independent People's Court. The court sentenced the CCP to pick up live organ atrocities. Falun Gong is the main source, and Uighurs, Tibetans and Christians may also suffer.
Dr. Trey and DAFOH member doctors jointly published an academic paper, ""The CCP's Cold Genocide of Falun Gong,"" pointed out that the development of China's organ transplant industry closely follows the CCP's genocidal policy toward Falun Gong. DAFOH has signed more than 3 million people in more than 50 countries and regions since its launch in 2012 to stop the global joint harvesting of organs. It has become one of the largest civil petitions in world history. This petition is also one of the major contributions of DAFOH's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.
DAFOH was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016, and the DAFOH nomination was nominated for the second Nobel Peace Prize related to the CCP's strong organ harvesting. The first nomination was two human rights lawyers David Kilgour and David Matas in 2010.
The medical journal Croatian Medical Journal published in June 2016, and the Nobel Prize nomination for DAFOH itself is an affirmation of its adherence to medical ethics. Although major medical advances each year receive the Nobel Prize, equally important medical ethics and The humanitarian side has received little attention. DAFOH is the only international medical organization that focuses on the study of prisoners of conscience as the main target group for the CCP's strong organ harvesting. Since the history of transplant abuse in China, since 2006, more and more evidence has shown that organs are taken for transplantation after the conscience is killed. Falun Gong is the main target.
The Croatian Medical Journal article writes that DAFOH's efforts over the past decade have been aimed at raising awareness and exposing unethical organ removal to the medical community and society, especially the CCP's forced organ removal, not only for crimes against humanity, but also It poses a serious threat to medicine. Finally, the article writes that the phenomenon of abuse of transplanted medicine, such as strong organ harvesting, cannot continue, and that such unethical behavior cannot be silenced, so that the world can no longer be a ""dangerous place of life."" This echoes the opening words of the article - Einstein's famous saying: The danger of the world we live in is not that people are bad, but because people have not done anything to change. ""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.""
This time, the ""Doctors' Anti-Strength Organs Organization"" DAFOH was awarded the ""Sister Teresa Social Justice Award"". It also caused the CCP to panic because justice must overcome evil.
