      <h1>Thank you to a 'stubborn and sassy' Value Cabs taxi driver</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">MAEVE CONNOLLY</a></address>
      <p>A night out and lost keys go hand in hand. When it happened to Darryl Campbell it led to an adventure that saw him 'breaking into' a taxi company, leaving a tub of home made curry in a café and marvelling at the "stubbornness and sass" of a taxi driver.</p>
      <p>The adventure began at 3.30am when Darryl realised he had lost his keys at some point during a cracking night out.</p>
      <p>After a few hours' sleep at a friend's house he began ringing around. The club. His landlord. Finally, Value Cabs. Bingo. Darryl had left his keys in a taxi at the very beginning of the night.</p>
      <p>The only problem was that the taxi driver, Keith, was on a job in Dublin and so were Darryl's keys.</p>
      <p>Darryl passed the time in a south Belfast café until Keith could meet him.</p>
      <p>"Keith comes to Sinnamon Coffee, because he’s sound. We meet. He hurls abuse at me and generally laughs at me for being a mess. I agree with him. I offer him money. He speeds off yelling ‘I’m not taking anything from you’.</p>
      <p>"I’m inspired by Keith’s stubbornness and sass so I must gift him something."</p>
      <p>Darryl chose "a cute card" and a Starbucks gift voucher. So far, so straightforward. Darryl's next challenge is delivering the gift and that's where the real adventure began.</p>
      <p>"I take my card to Value Cabs' head office and somehow break in. Jessica, a lovely admin lady, has no idea how I got in. I have no idea how I got in but I’m standing inside an empty building and she comes down the stairs all scared like ‘helllooooooooo’. </p>
      <p>"At this point, Jessica thinks I’ve broken the door. I think I’ve broken the door. I camp it up to let her know I’m here, I’m queer, and I’m not to be feared. </p>
      <p>"Jessica confirms Keith’s details are correct and promises she’ll get the card and gift to him. I thank her, tell her the story and she laughs. I think she likes me. I hope she does. I like her at this point as the police aren’t outside." </p>
      <p>Darryl's reason for getting in touch with the Irish News?</p>
      <p>"Keith, if you’re reading this, you’re a legend. Thanks for going the extra mile and being chill. Good people deserve shout outs. </p>
      <p>"Oh. And it turns out that I left a tub of curry my dad made for me in Sinnamon Coffee whilst rushing to meet Keith. The saga continues."</p>
