'New Neymar' set a record in Real Madrid
07 Nov 2019, 09:27 by Michael Kuduson

Real Madrid's Brazilian striker Rodrygo has set his sights on winning the Champions League with three goals in a 6-0 thrashing of Galatasaray on Wednesday.

The 18-year-old becomes only the second youngest player to score such goals in the Champions League after former Real Madrid striker Raul Gonzales.
He has already been criticized for 'new Neymar', as Neymar, from Santos, Brazil, came to Spain.
The only player in South America known to have been on the same level as Neymar was, not least, before his arrival from Real Madrid earlier this summer.
Rodrygo has scored five times in his first six appearances for the club in all competitions.
