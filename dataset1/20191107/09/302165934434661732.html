      <p>ISTANBUL, Nov 7 — The wife of slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi revealed “a lot of information” about the jihadist group’s “inner workings” after she was captured last year, a Turkish official said.</p>
      <p>The official said that Baghdadi’s spouse identified herself as Rania Mahmoud but was in fact Asma Fawzi Muhammad Al-Qubaysi.</p>
      <p>She was said to be the “first wife” of the IS leader, who was killed in a US special forces raid in Syria last month.</p>
      <p>The woman was arrested on June 2, 2018 in the province of Hatay, near the Syrian border, along with 10 others, including Baghdadi’s daughter, who identified herself as Leila Jabeer.</p>
      <p>The official said the family links were confirmed using a DNA sample of Baghdadi provided by Iraqi authorities.</p>
      <p>“We discovered (the wife’s) real identity pretty quickly. At that point, she volunteered a lot of information about Baghdadi and the inner workings of ISIS,” the official said.</p>
      <p>“We were able to confirm a lot of things that we already knew. We also obtained new information that led to a series of arrests elsewhere.”</p>
      <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan revealed for the first time yesterday that she had been detained.</p>
      <p>“We caught his wife — I say this today for the first time — but we didn’t make a big fuss about it,” Erdogan told a gathering of students in Ankara.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that Turkey had also captured Baghdadi’s sister and brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>Erdogan took a swipe at the United States for making a big deal of Baghdadi’s killing, saying: “They started a very big communication operation.”</p>
      <p>The IS leader was killed in a US special forces raid carried out with the help of Kurdish fighters in the north-western Syrian province of Idlib, just across the border from Turkey.</p>
      <p>According to the US account, Baghdadi ran into a dead-end tunnel in his hideout and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children.</p>
      <p>The raid came in the wake of a Turkish military offensive against the Kurdish militants, who have been a close ally of the West in the fight against IS, but are viewed as terrorists by Ankara. — AFP</p>
