Sponsored by Sto and supported by the World Architecture Festival (WAF), this year’s lineup was selected from nearly 2000 entries from 42 countries.
In its eighth year, The Architectural Photography Awards “highlights the expertise of architectural photography and aims to focus on the skill and creativity of the photographer”. For each one of the 6 categories, 4 entries were chosen to be part of the shortlist.
