        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>I’ll be the first one to admit it: I’m not the most generous spender when it comes to headphones. Frankly, I’m not all that into music anymore — and I prefer to stay alerted to my surroundings.</p>
      <p>But if there’s one time I’d make an exception, it’d be for noise-canceling cans, especially if they’re wireless, and especially if they’re Bose’s QuietComfort 35 II… at $100 off.</p>
      <p>Does it sound too good to be true? Maybe. But it is. There’s currently a sweet, nearly 30-percent discount on the QC 35 II on eBay. You can <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBose-QuietComfort-35-II-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black-Silver-Rose-Gold-NEW%2F193157921164">grab a pair for just $249.99</a>. How great is that?</p>
      <p>While I haven’t tried the QC 35 II myself, my colleagues say they sound amazing and come with Bose’s proprietary noise-canceling tech, which apparently happens to be excellent. Oh, and they can last a full 20 hours wireless, or up to 40 hours if plugged into your device.</p>
      <p>Personally, I always go for the black color option, if available. But if that’s not you, that’s cool: there’s also a silver and a rose gold alternative you can grab.</p>
      <p>Now go cop a pair by clicking <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBose-QuietComfort-35-II-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black-Silver-Rose-Gold-NEW%2F193157921164">here</a> and drown out the voices of those annoying humans at the office. At $100 off, you won’t regret it.</p>
