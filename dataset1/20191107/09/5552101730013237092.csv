都是莎士比亞惹的禍？　英國寶級女星和老公同台飆戲卻離婚收場
07 Nov 2019, 09:51 by 祁玲
好不容易把英國殿堂級四大女星茱蒂丹契、瑪姬史密斯、瓊安普洛萊特與艾琳阿特金斯齊聚一堂，紀錄片《女神們的下午茶》的導演羅傑米歇爾，卻只想讓她們講廢話、聊八卦和回憶過往。沒想到眾「女神」都很配合，女星瑪姬史密斯便在片中大爆離婚祕辛，該片也獲得影評網站爛番茄99%推薦。
2度獲奧斯卡獎的英國國寶影后瑪姬史密斯，以《哈利波特》的麥教授和《唐頓莊園》的太夫人形象深植人心。殊不知，時光倒帶回到60年代，她也曾美豔俏皮、戲路百變，和第一任丈夫羅伯史帝芬斯是英國影壇知名的銀色夫妻。
2人同台演過莎士比亞喜劇《都是男人惹的禍》，分別飾演冤家班尼狄克與碧翠絲，在片中唇槍舌戰，火花四射，在當時也備受讚譽，可惜後來以離婚收場。
不知是巧合還是魔咒，除了瑪姬，英國知名女星艾瑪湯普遜及導演肯尼斯布萊納這對夫妻檔，於1993年合演過新版本的《都是男人惹的禍》，2年後便感情生變、宣告仳離。
向來不喜歡在鏡頭前談論私生活的瑪姬，在《女神們的下午茶》卻打開話匣子，和老友茱蒂丹契、瓊安普洛萊特、艾琳阿特金斯罕見談起前夫羅伯。她坦言，那段婚姻曲曲折折，但大部時間還是快樂的。或許因為成為鎂光燈焦點，加上羅伯情緒起伏大、事業也大起大落，導致婚姻黯然收場。

羅伯已於1995年過世，現在的瑪姬只想記住幸福的回憶，《女神們的下午茶》也收錄許多2人早年合作的舞臺劇珍貴片段，讓觀眾一窺當年2人年輕時的舞台丰采。
《女》片邀請4位影壇資深女神首度在攝影機前，暢談他們超過半世紀的友誼。談演戲、劇場、家庭、婚姻、保養，甚至衰老，該片將於11月22日全台上映。

Finally, the British four-star actress Judy Dench, Maggie Smith, Joan Plolet and Irene Atkins gathered together, the director of the documentary ""Goddess' Afternoon Tea"" Roger Michel But just want them to talk nonsense, talk about gossip and recall the past. I didn't expect the ""Goddess"" to cooperate. The actress Maggie Smith made a big divorce in the film. The film also received 99% recommendation from the movie review website.
The 2nd Oscar-winning British national treasure, Maggie Smith, is deeply rooted in the image of Professor Harry of Harry Potter and Mrs. Tai of the Downton Manor. As everyone knows, time reversed back to the 1960s, she was once glamorous and playful, and her first husband, Robert Stefans, was a well-known silver couple in British cinema.
Two people played the Shakespeare comedy ""All Men's Misfortunes"" on the same stage. They played the Benedict and Beatrice respectively. They were screaming and sparkling in the film. They were also highly praised at the time, but later they later Divorce ends.
I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or a curse. Except for Maggie, the famous British actress Emma Thompson and director Kenneth Brana, the couple’s file, in 1993, co-produced a new version of “All Men’s Misfortunes”, 2 After the year, the feelings changed and declared.
Maggie, who has never liked to talk about private life in front of the camera, opened her voice in ""The Tea of the Goddess"", and talked with her old friend Judy Dench, Joan Plolet, and Eileen Atkins about her ex-husband Rob. . She admits that the marriage is twisted and twisted, but most of the time is still happy. Perhaps because of the focus of the spotlight, and the ups and downs of Robert's emotions, the cause of the ups and downs, the marriage ended.
