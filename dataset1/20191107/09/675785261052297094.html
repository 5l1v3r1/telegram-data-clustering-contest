      <h1>Arsene Wenger explains his theory on why Granit Xhaka lashed out at the Arsenal fans</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka was stripped of the captain's armband for swearing at the Arsenal fans against Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:05:39+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsene Wenger says Granit Xhaka lashed out at the Arsenal fans because he is a passionate character who is under immense pressure.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was stripped of the Gunners captaincy by Unai Emery after a run-in with the fans during the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Swiss took offence to fans booing him and reacted by storming off the pitch, cupping his ears, swearing and then heading down the tunnel to the changing room.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was "devastated" by the incident, according to his boss, who later confirmed that he had taken the armband off him as a direct result of his outburst.</p>

      <p>Arsene Wenger bought Xhaka when in charge of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal.</a></p>
      <p>Discussing the midfielder lashing out at the fans, he told BeIN Sports: "You have people with passion, with the pressure they are under, with the disappointment they carry out, they have sometimes reactions you don't want.</p>
      <p>"But you have to remind people of the behaviour you want.</p>

      <p>"I think Xhaka is an intelligent player, contrary to what I heard in recent weeks. Finally he apologised and that's what he [Emery] wanted from him."</p>
      <p>Wenger also explained he is still very much a fan of the north London club he managed for a staggering 22 years.</p>
      <p>"I don't talk a lot about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>, I just support them. I'm a supporter who wants a team to win, so that's all," Wenger added.</p>

      <p>"For me it's very difficult to have any assessment on Arsenal because it will be straight away interpreted when you've been at the club for such a long time.</p>
      <p>"So I'm just a supporter, when they don't win I'm not happy, when they win I'm very happy."</p>
