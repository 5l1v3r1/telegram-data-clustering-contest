      <p>This one’s for those of you out there looking for a little something different to do this weekend. Have you ever considered watercolor painting? <i>Coconuts Bali</i> has certainly mused over the idea, even when we consider ourselves artistically challenged. So if you’re somewhat similar (or just really enthusiastic about art!) this workshop might just be your entryway to gaining a new skill, and perhaps even find some calm and peace in the process. </p>
      <p>The workshop will be led by Yenti, who describes herself as a full-time architect and a free-time artist on <a href="http://instagram.com/yentiameliaa">Instagram</a>. Just a quick look at her work on the platform is enough to make one eager to learn how to capture moments through the strokes of your hand, no? There’s limited spot for the workshop, so don’t forget to reserve! </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sunday, Nov 10 at Xich Lo Bali, from 9am to 11.30am. The workshop costs IDR250k per person, including materials &amp; snacks. To reserve a spot, call +6287762388008. </i>

      <p>Sundays and wine, you say? Sign us up. The allure of this great combination is no secret, but then you throw in food and market to the mix, making it a little harder to resist. If you’re up for a casual day out this coming Sunday, the Market at VIN+ in Seminyak is a good place to be. Entry is free, and the price is pretty reasonable to enjoy some drinks and food during the occasion. They’re also promising clothes, accessories and second-hand goods stall for the event, as well as tarot reading and live music for entertainment.</p>

      <p>This shouldn’t be the first time you hear of <a href="http://instagram.com/wearemanja">Manja</a>, the Bali-based iconic trio who have been gracing many events on the island with their cool, pop performances. Now, the band plans to release their debut single in January 2020, and as <i>Coconuts Bali</i>’s heard them play several times before, we have a feeling they might become more of a household name sooner rather than later. </p>
      <p>Catch them at Deus Bali’s backyard this Sunday evening, where they will be joined by The Munchies and DJ Dubwill. Happy hours are from 5 to 7pm, and they have 2 for 1 deals for pretty much everything. If you’re planning on attending, do note that they recommend reserving a place if you plan on dining in. </p>
