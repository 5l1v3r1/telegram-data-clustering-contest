        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 7 – The government has launched the Kenya Investment Policy and the County Investment Handbook.  </b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking during the unveiling of the policy, Industry, Trade &amp; Cooperatives Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya described the handbook as a comprehensive and harmonized policy to guide attraction, facilitation and retention of private investment both at the national and county levels.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The handbook details establishment of County Investment Units (CIUs) to spearhead investments at the grassroots, build capacities for counties and promote the devolved units as viable investment destinations,” he said.</p>
      <p>The policy is guided by seven core principles, which emphasize the need for openness and transparency, inclusivity and sustainable development.</p>
      <p>The County Investment Handbook was developed to build capacity of county governments in effective investment promotion and facilitation.</p>
      <p>It is aimed at helping county structures dealing with investors in establishing priorities and lobbying for proper technical, financial and other forms of support from county and national stakeholders.</p>
      <p>“Well thought-out investments are critical to achieve the Big 4 Agenda and help Kenya to achieve industrial transformation at the county level and expand the contribution from manufacturing to national wealth as targeted in vision 2030,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Handbook was prepared with technical support of the World Bank Group (WBG), United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and The Netherlands Government.</p>
