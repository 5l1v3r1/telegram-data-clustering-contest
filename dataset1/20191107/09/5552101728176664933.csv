【新潟秋日限定】搭上紅葉特快　俯衝滿山震撼美景
07 Nov 2019, 09:57 by 林亦君, 何宗昇
秋天到新潟，一定要搭秋日限定的賞楓纜車，湯沢町的苗場山是日本很出名的滑雪勝地，連結山腳與山頂的「苗場纜車」，雖然是為滑雪場服務，但每年到了10月上旬就會限時開放，讓遊客可以來一場懸吊在空中的紅葉散步。
這條日本最長的滑雪纜車，全長5,481公尺，從苗場高原一路航向田代高原。每年秋季只開短短的一個多月，今年從10月5日開放到11月10日，如果錯過今年的紅葉纜車，對不起，只好等明年了。
滿懷期待登上纜車後，先越過幾個黃中帶綠的小山頭，眼眶便被最高明畫家也難調出的漸層色彩快速填滿。纜車一路越過雄偉的平標山與籠罩神秘色彩的二居湖，今天比較可惜，以往可見七彩的湖面，因為之前的颱風影響，顯得比較黃濁，偶爾可見河流蜿蜒奔流腳下，隨著山勢地形更迭的美景，讓大家快門按個不停。


纜車剛啟程時，腳下還可見綠、橘、黃的參差色彩。



接著看到山間溪流，山頭開始染上紅色。



到最低處時，距離溪流相當近，視覺感也頗震撼。



開始進入渺無人煙的高山之間。



再越過一個山頭，色彩便全面轉成濃重的橘黃。



在纜車上可打開小窗，紀錄無邊美景。

我們還來不及一一頌讚美景，纜車已經開始攀往高處，旁邊的日本朋友提醒說，纜車到了最高點便會俯衝而下，那一刻簡直像坐雲霄飛車般的刺激，偏偏身邊被居高臨下的震撼景色包圍，如果尖叫出聲，實在太煞風景了。
還好纜車下墜的速度沒想像中的快，我忍住了尖叫，但還是不由自主地為眼前滿山遍野的紅葉景色折服，單程25分鐘的車程，時而霧氣繚繞，彷若仙境，時而雲散霧開，視野清明宏大，整個人被濃重色彩徹底淘洗過一遍，十分過癮。


纜車最後目的地是標高1,346公尺的山頂，山頂氣溫比平地低，秋天約攝氏2到6度。

身心舒暢地抵達山頂，如果天候允許，可以在附近繼續健行之旅，或搭另一條田代纜車往更深的山裡去，但大部分人選擇在山頂的「ALM餐廳」稍做休憩，喝杯熱呼呼的「甘酒」與貌似迷你草仔粿的「笹團子」，便心滿意足打道回府了。


喝杯「甘酒」（後，400日圓／杯，約NT$111）與「笹團子」（前，180日圓／個，約NT$50）補充體力。



餐廳中升起柴火，予人暖意。



遊客圍著圓形炭火暖爐而坐，閒適聊天。



餐廳另一頭又有不同風景。



挑高的空間、超大落地窗，是吃午餐的好地方。



苗場纜車山頂站附近的「ALM餐廳」，是登頂後可暫時休憩的所在。

實際來過一趟苗場，才知道這個滑雪場其實四季皆宜，冬天當然是滑雪首選，除了經常舉辦國際比賽的苗場滑雪場，其他還有神樂、淺貝等適合親子的多樣化選擇，可一路滑到5月上旬，是日本唯一春天還能滑雪的地方。
既然可以「春滑」，可想而知，苗場的春天肯定超級短，不過同時也能看到日本最晚綻放的櫻花。到了夏天，最大型的活動自然是「富士搖滾音樂祭」了，每年7月最後一週的週四到週日，苗場會展開一連4天的音樂祭典，會有來自日本內外共200組樂手與樂團參與，8月14、15日兩天還有神轎巡禮與淺貝川畔的煙火秀。如此看來，位在新潟湯沢町的苗場，真是一年四季都能衝一波的好所在！

[Niigata Autumn Day Limited] Take the Red Leaf Express and dive into the beautiful scenery of the mountains
07 Nov 2019, 09:57 by Lin Yijun, He Zongsheng
In the autumn to Niigata, you must take the autumn maple line that is limited by the autumn. The Miaochang Mountain in Yuga-cho is a well-known ski resort in Japan. It connects the foothills and the top of the mountain to the ""Miaochang Cable Car"". Although it is for the ski resort, it is October every year. It will be open for a limited time in the first ten days, allowing visitors to take a walk in the red leaves hanging in the air.
The longest ski lift in Japan, with a total length of 5,481 meters, sails from the Naeba Plateau to the Tadai Plateau. It is only a short month in the autumn. It is open from October 5 to November 10 this year. If you miss this year's Hongye cable car, I am sorry, I have to wait until next year.
After looking forward to the cable car, I crossed the hills with greens in the middle of the yellow, and the eyelids were quickly filled by the gradual colors that the most brilliant painters couldn't recall. The cable car has crossed the majestic Pingbiao Mountain and the mysterious color of the Erju Lake. It is a pity today. In the past, the colorful lake surface was visible. Because of the influence of the typhoon, it appeared yellow turbid. Occasionally, the river rushed to the bottom, along with the mountain. The beautiful scenery of the terrain makes everyone's shutters keep pressing.


When the cable car is just off, there are also stippling colors of green, orange and yellow.



Then I saw the mountain stream and the hills began to stain red.



At the lowest point, the stream is quite close and the visual sense is quite shocking.



Start between the uninhabited mountains.



After crossing a hill, the color will turn into a thick orange.



A small window can be opened on the cable car to record the boundless beauty.

We still have no time to praise the beautiful scenery. The cable car has already begun to climb to the heights. The Japanese friend next to me reminded that the cable car will go down at the highest point. It is like a spur of the sky, but it is condescending. Surrounded by the stunning scenery, if you scream out, it’s too much scenery.
Fortunately, the speed of the cable car fell without thinking of the speed, I resisted screaming, but still involuntarily admire the red leaf scenery in front of the mountains, a one-way 25-minute drive, sometimes misty, like a fairyland, sometimes clouds and fog The vision is clear and grand, and the whole person has been thoroughly washed by heavy colors, which is very enjoyable.


The final destination of the cable car is the peak of 1,346 meters above sea level. The temperature at the top of the mountain is lower than that of the flat, and the fall is about 2 to 6 degrees Celsius.

Reach yourself to the top of the mountain. If the weather permits, you can continue your hiking trip nearby, or take another Tandai cable car to go deeper into the mountains, but most people choose to take a break at the ""ALM restaurant"" on the top of the mountain. The ""Ganji"" and the ""small squad"" that looks like a mini-grass scorpion are satisfied with their journey back home.


Add a cup of ""Ganji"" (later, 400 yen/cup, about NT$111) and ""Sui Tuanzi"" (previously, 180 yen/piece, about NT$50).



The firewood in the restaurant is warm and warm.



Visitors sit around a circular charcoal stove and chat casually.



The restaurant has a different view at the other end.



The high space and oversized floor-to-ceiling windows are a great place to have lunch.



The ""ALM Restaurant"" near the Mt. Cable Car Peak Station is where you can rest temporarily after climbing to the top.

Actually, I have come to see a seedling field, only to know that this ski resort is suitable for all seasons. Winter is of course the first choice for skiing. In addition to the Miaochang ski resort where international competitions are often held, there are other diversified choices such as Kagura and Asakusa. All the way to the beginning of May, it is the only place in Japan that can ski in the spring.
Since it is possible to ""spring slide"", it is conceivable that the spring of the seedling field must be super short, but at the same time, the cherry blossoms that bloom at the latest in Japan can be seen. In the summer, the biggest event is naturally the ""Fuji Rock Music Festival"". Every Thursday from Thursday to Sunday in the last week of July, the seedlings will start a four-day music festival. There will be 200 musicians and orchestras from inside and outside Japan. Participation, on August 14 and 15 two days there is a shrine tour and a fireworks show on the shallow Beichuan. It seems that the seedlings in Niigata Yuji-cho are really good for all the year round!
