      <p>OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso -- Burkina Faso's prime minister says his county is in shock following the attack by gunmen which killed at least 37 employees travelling to a Canadian-owned mine.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Christophe Dabire,<a href="https://twitter.com/christophedabir?lang=en"> in a tweet Thursday</a>, said the West African country is still reeling from the news of the attack and sent his condolences to the families of those killed.</p>
