      <p>The Ardee Road is badly flooded on approach to Dundalk this morning, and according to reports there are severe delays in both directions.</p>
      <p>The flooding is also impacting traffic coming in from Knockbridge.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Dromin Road off the M1 is closed, while the road from Ravel to Dunleer is reportedly flooded, along with the Barn Road in Dunleer, with a large flood outside Conachy's garage.</p>
      <p>In Drogheda, according one online user: "Donore Road past Newgrange centre like a river, do not drive through the flood there".</p>
