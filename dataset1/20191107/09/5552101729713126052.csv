防止未成年玩家沉迷　中國政府祭出「線上遊戲宵禁」手段
07 Nov 2019, 09:47 by 周文凱
中國政府對於電玩遊戲產業的管控力道持續加強中。中國國家新聞出版署近日發出《關於防止未成年人沉迷網絡遊戲通知》，除了再次重申力推網路實名制之外，現在更出現針對未成年玩家「遊戲時間限制」、「線上遊戲宵禁」，以及遊戲儲值金額的管控。
根據新華社報導，這次政府發出的通知共有「六方面舉措」。第一項是「進行網路遊戲帳號實名制註冊」。雖然中國政府要求「實名制」並不稀奇，但值得關注的是，此次通知的用字更為強硬，「要求『嚴格』實施實名制註冊，所有網路遊戲中的用戶都須使用真實的身分文件才可以註冊遊戲帳號。」
通知的第二項是「嚴格控制未成年人使用網路遊戲時段時長」，明確規定每日22時至次日8 時不得為未成年人提供遊戲服務。除此之外，未成年玩家的遊戲時間平日每日不得超過1.5小時，在法定假日每日也不能超過3小時。
第三項則是規範「向未成年人提供付費服務」。規定網路遊戲廠商不得向未滿 8 歲的用戶提供遊戲付費服務。若是 8 歲以上，未滿 16 歲的用戶，雖然可以進行遊戲儲值，但單次儲值金額不得超過50元人民幣（約新台幣220元），每月儲值金額不可超過200元人民幣（約新台幣870元）。而16 歲以上、未滿18歲的用戶，單次儲值金額不可超過100元人民幣（約435元新台幣），每月儲值金額不得超過400元人民幣（約新台幣1740元）。
至於該通知的第四項到第六項，主要是重申一些基本的要求，包括確實加強行業監管、探索實施適齡提示制度，以及要引導家長、學校等社會各界力量履行對未成年的監護、守護責任，幫助未成年人樹立正確的網路遊戲消費習慣、觀念。
從通知內容來看，第一項措施或許可解讀為過去遊戲廠商對實名制的推動並不確實，讓中國在遊戲監管、尤其是對未成年玩家的監管難以推行，因此才有這次更強硬的要求。而第二項措施則形同對未成年玩家實行「線上遊戲宵禁」，加上每日遊戲時間的控管，基本上已算是動用國家機器替家長管教孩子作息。而第三項對於儲值金額的限制，雖然對遊戲業來說可能會少賺一筆，但對家長而言應該算是滿受到歡迎的一項措施。
只是雖然中國當局祭出不少手段來防止未成年玩家沉迷線上遊戲，然而教養孩子終究還是家長的責任；政府可以透過一些政策來引導遊戲業善盡社會責任，但連孩子的遊戲時間政府都要介入管控，大概也只有中國才能訂出這樣的規範了。

Preventing underage players from indulging Chinese government to offer ""online game curfew""
07 Nov 2019, 09:47 by Zhou Wenkai
The Chinese government's control over the video game industry continues to strengthen. China’s National Press and Publication Administration recently issued the “Notice on Preventing Minors from Indulging in Online Games”. In addition to reaffirming the push for online real-name systems, there are now more “game time limits” for “underage players” and “online game curfews”. Control of the amount of stored value of the game.
According to the Xinhua News Agency, the notice issued by the government has a ""six-sided initiative."" The first item is ""registration of real-name system for online game accounts."" Although the Chinese government's request for a ""real name system"" is not unusual, it is worth noting that the wording of this notice is more tough. ""Require strict implementation of real-name registration. Users in all online games must use real identity documents. You can register your game account.""
The second item of the notice is ""Strictly control the length of time for minors to use online games"", which clearly stipulates that no gaming services should be provided for minors from 22:00 to 8:00 every day. In addition, the game time of underage players should not exceed 1.5 hours per day on weekdays and 3 hours per day on statutory holidays.
The third is to regulate the provision of paid services to minors. It is stipulated that online game manufacturers are not allowed to provide game payment services to users under the age of 8. If the user is over 8 years old and under 16 years old, although the game can store the value, the single stored value cannot exceed 50 yuan (about NT$220), and the monthly stored value cannot exceed 200 yuan. NT$870). For users over 16 years old and under 18 years old, the amount of a single stored value cannot exceed 100 yuan (about NT$435), and the monthly stored value cannot exceed 400 yuan (about NT$1,740).
As regards the fourth to sixth items of the notice, it mainly reaffirms some basic requirements, including the actual strengthening of industry supervision, the exploration and implementation of the age-appropriate reminder system, and the guidance of parents, schools and other social forces to perform the supervision and protection of underage. Responsibility to help minors establish the correct online game consumption habits and concepts.
Judging from the content of the notice, the first measure or license interpretation is not true that the game makers in the past promoted the real-name system. It is difficult for China to supervise game supervision, especially for underage players. Therefore, this is a tougher requirement. . The second measure is similar to the implementation of ""online game curfew"" for underage players. With the control of daily game time, it is basically used to use the national machine for parents to discipline their children. The third restriction on the amount of stored value, although it may be less profitable for the game industry, should be considered a welcome measure for parents.
However, although the Chinese authorities have resorted to many means to prevent underage players from indulging in online games, it is still the responsibility of parents to educate their children. The government can guide the game industry to fulfill its social responsibilities through some policies, but even the children’s game time is required by the government. Intrusion control, probably only China can set such a specification.
