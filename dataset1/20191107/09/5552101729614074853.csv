07 Nov 2019, 09:04 by 陳慧明, 李鍾泉
寶格麗自今日起，在重新開幕的台北101 PETER MARINO概念店中，舉辦Cinecittà and Beyond電影藝術古董珠寶展，邀請林依晨擔任嘉賓，她透露自己生活簡單，無法應付複雜的人際關係，雖然「做人」進度依然跟過去一樣，但生日願望許下的是「少點戰爭、少點汙染物」，非常佛系大愛的師姐路線。
林依晨無愧是「零負評女神」，減少工作量很長一段時間的她，被媒體逼問生子進度時，笑說自己尚未「做人」成功，「我今天的服裝應該被束成20寸左右的腰了吧？所以做人進度還是一樣的。」有希望之後龍鳳胎還是男孩或女孩？她笑說：「健康就好。」


林依晨身上配戴的是BVLGARI Heritage典藏系列黃K金彩寶飾品。

媒體問她長年下來如何保養自己？她說：「依然就是簡單過生活。我無法應付複雜的人際關係、也無法過著每天看社交軟體的生活。」上月底剛過生日，問她可有許下什麼願望？她表示，「其實每年都一樣的，就是希望能少點戰爭、少點汙染物。」
林志玲本月中將在台南舉辦婚禮，林依晨坦承自己有收到喜帖，她說：「收到時真有受寵若驚的感覺耶，可惜我當天已有安排，無法參加婚禮，現在還在想要送什麼禮物，很難送耶，她是如此貼心的人。」
對於寶格麗，她說自己最愛的是古幣系列，而不是鑽石、彩寶，「結婚時經紀人送我一個古幣戒指，是我很珍藏的東西，常常會忍不住撫摸它，想著它當年的故事性。」她並透露自己在配件中最愛耳環，「外套、圍巾一戴，項錬就會看不到，但是無論如何都能看到耳環，而且耳環可以顯現一個人的個性、心情。」
