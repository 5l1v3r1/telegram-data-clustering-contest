JAEN, Nueva Ecija – The municipal mayor here and her councilor-son, including the municipal treasurer and an alleged dummy contractor were sued before the Office of the Ombudsman for alleged falsification of public documents, malversation of public funds and violation of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
Named respondents in an administrative case filed by former municipal Engineer Crispin G. Laureano before the anti-graft body were municipal Mayor Sylvia C. Austria, her son, Councilor Sylvestre C. Austria, municipal Treasurer Edelson Espiritu and contractor Ma. Perla Tablante, of the Pearl Cast Construction and Trading.
