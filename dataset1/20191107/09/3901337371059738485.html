      <p>As much as we will remember Benni McCarthy for his passion on the touchline, the head coach has also left us with some unforgettable ‘quotables’.</p>
      <p>Cape Town City terminated the contract of McCarthy at midnight on Sunday, leaving much of the football fraternity in shock due to the timing of their announcement.</p>

      <p>While farewell tributes have poured in from all over, Soccer Laduma takes a look at five memorable quotes from the former head coach, where he enjoyed having quite the dig at his counterparts, the match referee and even his own players.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Ref Could Have Worn A Chiefs Shirt…</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The referee was terrible today, he might as well have put on a Kaizer Chiefs shirt and then I hear he is from Cape Town so he had to prove a point that he was not being biased?” he told the media after a painful loss to Chiefs at the Cape Town Stadium in October this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rulani Will Never Come Out On Top In A Fist Fight</b>
      </p>
      <p>“So I felt he just needed to know what was going through my mind. I just said, 'you are winning now and you want to kick balls and throw it,' and then when he was chasing for balls I just said 'leave it there! </p>
      <p>“But it wasn’t a fight, if it was a fight he won’t come out on top that I can assure you (laughs),” McCarthy said as he explained the heated exchange of words between himself and Rulani Mokwena this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pirates Were Not Going To Be Champions On My Watch…</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I have to again sincerely apologise to Orlando Pirates that today wasn’t going to be the day where they become champions on my watch,” McCarthy told the media after their 2-2 draw to the Bucs at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When The Ref Is Chiefs’ Best Player…</b>
      </p>
      <p>“But when you’re playing against a Kaizer Chiefs team and their best player is the referee then you know you’ve got no chance.</p>
      <p>“I know the league is going to come for me but they are more than welcome. I don’t know how many times this is going to happen before we do something about it,” McCarthy said some time in last season after a defeat to Chiefs. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Even My Grandma Could Have Scored…</b>
      </p>
      <p>“We play nice football and I could count, 4, 5, at least five goalscoring chances, I think even my Grandma could have put it in,” said McCarthy last season after voicing his frustration for his side's lack of goals. </p>
