      <p>Even as the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tea-board">Tea Board </a>of India has moved the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court alleging trademark infringement over the use of the word ‘Darjeeling’ for sale of goods at one of ITC’s hotels in Kolkata, it is hopeful that the tussle can be solved amicably. The board is also hopeful that it can negotiate with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/itc">ITC </a>to allow it to use the geographical indication (GI)-protected Darjeeling logo at its hotel lounge. “We have already spent a huge amount of money to protect the GI tag of Darjeeling and will spend more if necessary. Darjeeling is a protected trademark of the board and has a historical value. I am hopeful that the issue can be solved amicably,” said A K Ray, deputy chairman of the Tea Board, on the sidelines of the 47th Annual General Meeting of the Tea Association of India. The board has claimed that the word ‘Darjeeling’ itself is protected by the GI tag, and it has sole authority over the name, so no entity could use the word without its approval.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/itc">ITC </a>has been contesting the claim.</p>
