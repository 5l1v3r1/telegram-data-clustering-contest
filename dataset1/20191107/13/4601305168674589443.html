      <p>The reputation of Damascus steel goes back as far as the 3rd century, to ancient Syria. Without getting into the nerdier aspects of metallurgy, there's a good reason it was highly prized by the weaponsmiths of old.</p>
      <p>These days, you can still get a taste of its distinctive look in this <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/damascus-steel-hand-forged-3-pcs-brown-kitchen-chef-knife-set?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=damascus-steel-hand-forged-3-pcs-brown-kitchen-chef-knife-set&amp;utm_term=scsf-346655&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MrkM&amp;scsonar=1">Hand-Forged Damascus Steel Chef Knife Set</a>.</p>
      <p>That telltale wavy pattern isn't just for show, either. It's the result of layering high-carbon steel over lower-carbon steel as much as 200 times. The result is a blade with a hardness rating of 55 HRC, suitable for display in any serious chef's kitchen.</p>
      <p>This particular set of three knives comes with pakka wood handles that only increase its pedigree as an heirloom. This kind of performance requires a little extra TLC, and a wipe with vegetable oil will keep it rust-free. But with proper care, it'll be in your kitchen for many expertly-cut meals.</p>
