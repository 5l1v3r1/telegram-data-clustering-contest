《葉問》系列是功夫經典作，在影迷期待下再次集合黃金陣容，由主演葉問的甄子丹領軍，加上原班人馬導演葉偉信及監製黃百鳴及知名武術指導袁和平，7日發布最新預告，甄子丹力戰群雄的畫面曝光，詠春身手果然氣勢驚人，葉師父被逼出手，嚴厲向對手說了一句「夠了」！再次展現葉問的宗師氣度。
首支預告中，看到年少時期曾在英文學校唸書的葉問，可以用簡單的英文回答外籍校長的提問，帶出這集以國外為背景的故事。預告中可以接連見到葉問與飾演中華總會會長萬宗華的吳樾大打出手，2人以玻璃轉盤切磋武術；還有在唐人街中秋晚會挑戰葉問的外國跆拳高手，葉問一招便把飛起來的對手打趴在地。

同時也可看到葉問與曾參演《奇異博士》的英國動作演員史考特飾演的海軍陸戰隊軍官，在軍營對決，可以見到甄子丹的驚人身手，新加入的吳建豪飾演華籍軍官、飾演李小龍的陳國坤在體育館打跆拳道，也點出華人當時在海外受到歧視的景況。
甄子丹與導演葉偉信已建立起良好默契，他4度詮釋葉問一角，決定選擇隨心的方式挑戰自我演出：「我已經很了解葉問這個人物，所以導演在開拍前兩天才給我劇本，再結合現場給我的感覺去琢磨，結果演出來的效果，我和導演都很滿意。」


《葉問4：完結篇》中的打鬥場面當然不少，但各有情節巧妙，要讓戲迷看了過癮。（華映提供）

《葉問》系列橫跨十年，第一集探討的「生存」、第二集的「生活」、第三集的「生命」，到這集父子間，葉問為了兒子前途，遠赴美國尋找學校，葉問見證了華人被歧視，導演葉偉信說：「每次葉問出手，都因為看到不公義，這是葉問武之初心，從來沒變，這集更想帶出，無論你在哪，只要自己是爭氣、自強，哪裡都是美滿幸福。」《葉問4：完結篇》將於12月20日正式上映。
