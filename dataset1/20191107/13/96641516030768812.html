      <p>If you've been patiently waiting for a retailer to put Sony's excellent WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones on sale, your patience has paid off. Amazon has discounted both the black and silver models by $72, making them <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=7f865a55bef1d5fd3da37cde611eb8e8&amp;language=en_US">$278</a> instead of their usual $350. <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/product/B07G4MNFS1">According to price tracker Camelcamelcamel</a>, that 21 percent price cut is the biggest discount Amazon has ever offered on the Bluetooth headphones.</p>
      <p>We absolutely loved the WH-1000XM3 when we reviewed them late last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/18/sony-1000xm3-review/">awarding them a score of 94</a>. Even with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/16/bose-700-headphones-review/">new competition that has entered the space</a> since Sony released the WH-1000XM3, they're still the best Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones you can buy. They feature best-in-class noise cancellation, 30 plus hours of battery life on a single charge, USB-C fast charging and a very comfortable fit. Moreover, unlike some other premium wireless headphones, they support almost every Bluetooth audio codec under the sun, including aptX HD and AAC -- which helps with latency and signal quality. The only thing we didn't like about the WH-1000XM3 was their touch controls, which can be finicky in some situations.</p>
