      <p>Despite the fact that the Switch is in full swing and how offers an entry-level option in the form of the Switch Lite, Nintendo's Doug Bowser continues to refuse to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/talking_point_come_in_nintendo_3ds_your_time_is_up">call time</a> on the console's forerunner, the 3DS.</p>
      <p>The veteran handheld is selling <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/sorry_nintendo_but_the_3ds_really_is_dead_now">dismally</a>, software support has effectively <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/nintendo_finally_hints_that_it_has_ditched_game_development_on_the_3ds">ended</a> (at least from Nintendo's standpoint) and services are slowly but surely being <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/pay_your_respects_the_3ds_youtube_service_has_now_ended_in_japan">cancelled</a>. Despite all of this, Bowser maintains that the 3DS remains a viable 'entry point' for younger players.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles">The Verge</a>, he said:</p>
      <blockquote>We continue to look at the 3DS family, both hardware and games, as a strong entry point for some consumers. And we’re seeing that. As long as consumer demand is there, we’ll continue to provide both hardware and software on the front.</blockquote>
      <p>When quizzed at what point it could be said that the 3DS is <i>finally</i> dead as a platform, Bowser replied:</p>
      <blockquote>We’re certainly not going to say it today. I think time will tell. We will continue to support 3DS this holiday and into 2020.</blockquote>
      <p>On one hand, <i>of course</i> Bowser isn't going to come out and declare the 3DS done and dusted – not while Nintendo still has inventory of the console it wants to shift over the festive period. But in the cold light of day, the machine has little in the way of a solid future; software support has all but dried up and it's almost impossible to find brand-new versions of anything but the 2DS variants of the system now. <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/feature_best_nintendo_3ds_games">Still, it has an amazing library of games, so that's certainly something.</a></p>
      <p>Perhaps 2020 is when Nintendo will finally pluck up the courage to bid the 3DS family a fond farewell.</p>
