      <p>Brussels - Irish sprinter<b> Sam Bennett</b> is to leave <b>Bora-Hansgrohe</b>, the German team announced on Thursday, and is expected to join Deceuninck-Quick Step.</p>
      <p>Bennett, 29, won three stages at the 2018 Giro d'Italia and two stages on this year's Tour of Spain.</p>
      <p>"Over the last six years, Bora-Hansgrohe developed Sam Bennett into one of the best sprinters in the peloton," the team said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Against this background it however became more and more difficult to align the team's and rider's goals.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, Bora-Hansgrohe's management has decided to accept Sam Bennett's wish to leave Bora-Hansgrohe and continue his journey with another team."</p>
      <p>Bennett began his career with Sean Kelly's An Post team in Ireland before joining NetApp-Endura in 2014 which a year later evolved into Bora.</p>
      <p>Deceuninck-Quick Step have been courting him for several weeks.</p>
