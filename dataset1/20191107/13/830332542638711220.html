      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Gun control advocates are set to rally in Madison ahead of a special legislative session on gun restrictions that's expected to go nowhere.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last month ordered a special session to take up bills mandating universal background checks and allowing judges to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat.</p>
      <p>Groups including Moms Demand Action, Doctors for America and the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee will hold news conferences and rally at the state Capitol ahead of the session.</p>
      <p>Republicans have said they will gavel in and immediately gavel out, ending the session as soon as it begins.</p>
