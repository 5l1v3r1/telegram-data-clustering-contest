      <p>Ansu Fati was the star attraction as Barcelona presented their youth football section at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>While Ernesto Valverde has considered him a first-team player since his debut against Real Betis, the forward didn't want to miss an emotional day for the academy. By the same token, Carles Perez was also present.</p>
      <p>Ansu, now 17, spoke for the first time since making his debut for the first team in an interview with Barça TV.</p>
      <p>"I've always wanted to be here," he said. "This has been my idea from the start and I hope I can spend my whole life here."</p>
      <p>The teenager says nothing has changed since his debut: "I am calm, trying to do normal things. These (the U19s and B team players) are my teammates and will continue to be. I spend all day with them and nothing will change."</p>
      <p>Ansu scored against Osasuna and again vs. Valencia: "Osasuna was a dream fulfilled, my first goal with the first team. And then Valencia, at Camp Nou... They were nights that I had dreamed of becoming a reality. You can't believe it."</p>
