      <p>LONDON, Nov 7 — A police officer has been charged with murder after the 2016 death of former English Premier League striker Dalian Atkinson, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>An alternative charge of unlawful act manslaughter was also put forward.</p>
      <p>Atkinson, 48, died when police fired a high-voltage Taser stun-gun at him during an incident outside his father’s house in his home town of Telford in central England.</p>
      <p>A second officer was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>“This decision was made following a careful review of all the evidence presented to us by the Independent Office for Police Conduct following an investigation,” said Jenny Hopkins of the CPS.</p>
      <p>The unidentified officers were due to appear at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court later today.</p>
      <p>Atkinson started his professional career at Ipswich Town and his clubs included Sheffield Wednesday, Aston Villa and Spain’s Real Sociedad as well as Turkish side Fenerbahce. — Reuters</p>
