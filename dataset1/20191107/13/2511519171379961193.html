      <h1>Tottenham’s Son Heung-min reveals text message exchange with Andre Gomes after horror injury</h1>
      <h2>Son netted twice on Wednesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:05:30+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Veal</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/son-heung-min">Son Heung-min</a> has revealed he has exchanged messages with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andre-gomes">Andre Gomes</a> and says he will use the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder’s injury as personal motivation.</p>
      <p>It was the South Korean’s tackle in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham</a>‘s 1-1 draw at Goodison Park on Sunday that led to Gomes breaking and dislocating his ankle.</p>
      <p>Son, who made a genuine attempt to play the ball, was inconsolable when he saw the extent of the injury and needed support from Spurs in the aftermath, which made him a doubt for Wednesday’s trip to Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p>However, Son – who was sent off for the tackle but later had the red card overturned by the Football Association – wanted to get back out on the pitch and will be glad he did after scoring twice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/tottenham-vs-crvena-zvedza-uefa-champions-league-2019-lo-celso-red-star-belgrade-a9188756.html">in the 4-0 win</a> that puts his side on the brink of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> knockout stages.</p>
      <p>The two goals have done little to ease Son’s guilt, but he is determined to use the incident as a positive having been in touch with Gomes.</p>
      <p>“I text him, it’s been a really tough few days for me,” Son revealed. “I text him before I flew and he text me back. I still feel really, really bad about this. I feel really sorry.</p>
      <p>“Football is a sport where something [like this] can happen, nobody wants to see this situation.</p>
      <p>“I’m so sad this happened and that I was involved with this situation. It’s been a really, really tough few days.</p>
      <p>“I just text him to say best wishes to you, I’m really sorry for you, your family and your team-mates.”</p>
      <p>On his return to action, he added: “I have to respect that this is what I have to do, what I love to do. I realise how lucky I am.</p>

      <p>“Of course, Gomes got the injury but the people around me sent me really, really strong messages.</p>
      <p>“My team-mates and even Everton fans as well, as well as Tottenham fans, even from South Korea.</p>
      <p>“I’m really, really grateful for that. Still, I feel really sorry about this situation, but on the pitch I want to work for it because the team needs especially positive energy.</p>
      <p>“I tried to work out this situation. I want to send the message that I’m really grateful for all the messages from every single supporter.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it’s really difficult to say this, but I’m really grateful and I realise how lucky I am.</p>

      <p>“I want to pay them back on the pitch. That’s all I can do. I want to respect him [Gomes] as well, and this is how I show respect – by working harder than in the past.”</p>
      <p>It was also a good night for Giovani Lo Celso after he scored on his first start for the club, three months after joining on transfer deadline day.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian said: “I have been waiting a lot after I got injured, but I am enjoying this moment and would like to thank my team-mates and the staff.</p>
      <p>“I am starting to adapt well. I had a small problem with the injury with the national team, but I am back and more importantly I now feel well and have completed my first game for the club.”</p>
