Tracy Letts Play The Minutes Heads to Broadway, Starring Tracy Letts and Armie Hammer
07 Nov 2019, 13:30 by Jackson McHenry
In what feels like an appropriate level of haste and efficiency for a play about a small-town council meeting, Tracy Letts’s play The Minutes is finally coming to Broadway three years after it premiered in Chicago. The Steppenwolf production has announced that it will start performances on Broadway at the Cort Theatre on February 25, 2020, and open March 15. The Minutes will star Letts himself, as well as Ian Barford, Blair Brown, Cliff Chamberlain, K. Todd Freeman, Armie Hammer, Danny McCarthy, Jessie Mueller, Sally Murphy, Austin Pendleton, and Jeff Still. Anna D. Shapiro, who directed this season’s other Tracy Letts play Linda Vista (which starred Barford), will direct The Minutes, which is currently set for a Tony-bait 16-week run through June 14.
If you somehow don’t have enough Tracy Letts in your life already, he also appears in Ford v Ferrari and Little Women this fall. In other news that will make Chicago theater fans happy, Jessie Mueller’s presence in The Minutes makes her the third Mueller sibling on Broadway this season, as Abby Mueller is playing Jane Seymour in Six, while Matt Mueller is playing Ron Weasley in Cursed Child. Welcome to the talented Midwestern Mueller Theatrical Universe.
