      <p>Speaking on achieving the milestone, Rohit said: "Firstly, I never thought I would play so many games. I am grateful for the opportunity I got in the past and till date as well. It has been a long journey since I made my debut as there had been many ups and downs. I have now understood my game. Yes, I am very happy where I stand right now."</p>
