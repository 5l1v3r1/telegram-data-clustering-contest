      <h1>Arsenal’s Kieran Tierney ‘learning a lot’ from Unai Emery and says players must ‘correct’ poor form and results</h1>
      <h2>The left-back played the full 90 minutes in Arsenal’s Europa League draw on Wednesday</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> insists it is up to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> players to address a poor run of form as pressure continues to mount on head coach <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a>.</p>
      <p>A 1-1 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EuropaLeague">Europa League</a> draw against Vitoria in Portugal on Wednesday afternoon only ramped up the criticism aimed at Emery as the Gunners were lucky to leave Guimaraes with a share of the spoils.</p>
      <p>Shkodran Mustafi opened the scoring for the visitors with an 80th-minute header – Arsenal’s first and only effort on target during the game – only to see Bruno Duarte equalise in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>It is the fourth time in 10 days that Emery’s side have let a lead slip and Arsenal have now won just one of their last six games across all competitions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-news-latest-unai-emery-jose-mourinho-next-manager-a9188676.html">Emery was defiant following the game when was asked about speculation</a> linking former Chelsea and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager Jose Mourinho as a potential replacement – simply replying “I am the coach.”</p>
      <p>But as the whispers surrounding Emery’s future seem to increase in volume with each passing game, Tierney believes turning results around is a challenge that lies on the shoulders of the players rather than their beleaguered coach.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was convinced Emery was the right man to address the recent slide, the Scotland defender replied: “Yes, of course.</p>
      <p>“It is up to us as players to correct it on the pitch. For me, he (Emery) has been brilliant since I’ve come in.</p>
      <p>“I have learned a lot. I am learning a lot every day, playing with great players. Everybody in the changing room has got belief in each other and the manager.”</p>
      <p>Tierney, who joined from Celtic for £25million in the summer, also credited Emery with helping him develop his game as he looks to establish himself in the Arsenal side having made the move while carrying a groin injury</p>

      <p>“Of course,” he replied when asked if Emery was making him a better player.</p>
      <p>“The players around me are making me a better player as well. I am just learning and I am enjoying every week.</p>
      <p>“He likes to keep the ball, pass the ball with a possession type game and for me I am just learning and working on my technique with him.</p>
      <p>“I am working on passing and crossing – everything in general. I am working with the coaches as well, so just all round I am learning.”</p>
      <p>Tierney has started just six games for Arsenal as the club continue to manage the 22-year-old back to full fitness.</p>
      <p>He has also been omitted from the last two Scotland squads at the request of Arsenal after the club put in place a full recovery programme.</p>
      <p>It means Tierney will miss the upcoming <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan but he accepts the decision and is keen to rest up, also revealing Scotland are on board with the situation</p>

      <p>“They (Scotland) understand,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Of course you want to play for your national team, but you need to do what is best for your career long-term.</p>
      <p>“Tonight this my second game in five days so near the end I was tiring.</p>
      <p>“It is probably the right decision as now I am going into the international break knowing I am getting a rest and recovery, because since my operation the load has went up, up and up.</p>
      <p>“To get a rest would be beneficial and hopefully for the next camp I’m ready.”</p>
