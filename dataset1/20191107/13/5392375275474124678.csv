In the recent Chinese 11.11 sales, the Xiaomi TV brand took only 13 minutes and 42 seconds to reach 100,000 units. However, unlike Xiaomi smartphones, Xiaomi TV is not widely available. Now, the latest report is that the Xiaomi TV brand is now officially in China.  In a new Xiaomi poster, the company said “Hola, Spain! We are here!”



On November 6, 2019, Xiaomi TV officially entered the Spanish market. Recently, Xiaomi TV officially released the Xiaomi TV 5 series. At the press conference, Li Xiaoshuang, the general manager of the Xiaomi TV Department, made a bold statement: Xiaomi TV shipments will remain the highest in China year after year. At the press conference, Xiaomi released the Quantum TV 50M Pro, 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch. Interestingly, Xiaomi TVs have only been in the market for a few years.
