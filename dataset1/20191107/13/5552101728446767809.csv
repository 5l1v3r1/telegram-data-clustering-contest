榮恩回來了！　《靈異女僕》再掀恐怖題材熱潮
07 Nov 2019, 13:36 by 娛樂組
打從電影《哈利波特》系列告一段落後，已經很久沒有看到飾演榮恩的演員魯伯葛林特的蹤跡。不像他的同事艾瑪華森《美女與野獸》演出真人版的貝兒，或丹尼爾雷德克里夫熱衷演出獨立製片，他幾乎消失在影壇上。好不容易現在魯伯特葛林特終於復出了，這回要挑戰恐怖影集《靈異女僕》。
由Apple TV+投資的恐怖影集《靈異女僕》（Servant），找來《分裂》《異裂》而重新翻紅的導演M.奈沙馬蘭，擔任劇集的監製與導演。故事發生在費城，一對夫妻雇用一位全職女僕，希望擔任他們小孩的保姆。

這看起來再稀鬆平常不過，但是等到妻子出門後，丈夫才向這位女僕坦承，其實他們的小孩早就死了，嬰兒床上的那個洋娃娃，只是幫忙妻子度過悲傷時期、漸漸接受現實的替代品，希望她不會在意。但這位女僕一點都不在意演這齣「家家酒」，甚至日子一久，她手上的洋娃娃好像逐漸有了生命似的，儼然「假戲真作」，還傳出嬰兒的哭聲！到底這個房子裡頭，無法分辨現實的是誰？而他們請來的，真的是位女僕嗎，還是別的？
打從《安娜貝爾》紅了之後，各種靈異娃娃的題材就不斷冒出來，《靈異女僕》的故事猛一聽好像很耳熟，但仔細一想，真正的蹊蹺似乎不在洋娃娃身上，而是把洋娃娃當活人一樣照顧的保姆。加上導演M.奈沙馬蘭最喜歡玩劇情大逆轉的遊戲，也屢屢把觀眾嚇個半死。全劇預計在11月28日上線推出。

Rong En is back! ""Spiritual Maid"" renews the horror theme
07 Nov 2019, 13:36 by Entertainment Group
After a while from the movie ""Harry Potter"" series, it has been a long time since I saw the trace of Ron Greenett, the actor who played Rong. Unlike his colleague Emma Watson's ""Beauty and the Beast"" performance live version of Belle, or Daniel Radcliffe is keen to perform independent production, he almost disappeared into the film. Finally, Rupert Grint has finally come back, this time to challenge the horror album ""The Sprouting Maid.""
M. Nasha Maran, the director of the horror album ""Servant"" who invested in Apple TV+, and found ""Split"" and ""Splinter"", served as the producer and director of the series. The story takes place in Philadelphia, where a couple hires a full-time maid who wants to be the nanny of their child.


As a maid of a babysitter at home, she is more than anyone else to take care of this doll. What is weird? (available from Apple TV)

This seems to be commonplace, but after the wife went out, the husband admitted to the maid, in fact, their child had already died. The doll in the crib only helped his wife through the sad period and gradually accepted the reality. I hope she won't care. But the maid was not interested in playing this ""house wine"". Even for a long time, the doll in her hand seemed to have a life like it. It was a ""fake play"" and a cry of the baby! In the end of this house, who can't tell the reality? And they invited, is it really a maid, or something else?
After the ""Annabel"" was red, the themes of various spiritual dolls continued to emerge. The story of ""The Prodigal Maid"" seemed to be familiar, but when you think about it, the real embarrassment does not seem to be on the doll, but the doll. When the living person is taking care of the nanny. In addition, the director M. Nasamaran's favorite game of reversing the drama has repeatedly scared the audience to death. The whole series is expected to be launched on November 28.
