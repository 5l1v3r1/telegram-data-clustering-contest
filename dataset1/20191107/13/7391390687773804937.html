      </p>
      <p>The Moon remains in dreamy and tender Pisces today, heightening our feelings as well as our need to escape. This means that any activity that helps to heal, soothe, and replenish ourselves and others is what we should be looking to do, namely as the Moon joins up with compassionate and magical Neptune in Pisces in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>By the afternoon, the Pisces Moon teams up with powerful Pluto in Capricorn, which encourages us to seek out the healing and catharsis needed to deal with our tougher emotions. Towards the evening, the Pisces Moon teams up with Mercury retrograde in insightful Scorpio, which can help us to initiate and engage conversations that can help to foster intimacy, emotional honesty, forgiveness, and love.</p>
      <p>With the Moon squaring off with generous and bountiful Jupiter in Sagittarius by late tonight, we're called to open our hearts. On a separate note, we may have to be careful of overindulging or overextending ourselves under this Moon-Jupiter combo.</p>
      <p>Read below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/your-november-2019-monthly-horoscope-17894181">November 2019 monthly horoscope</a>.</p>

      <p>You might be feeling more tender or sensitive than usual today. And while you shouldn't stifle your feelings, you may need to be a bit more careful about the kind of energy you're absorbing and focusing on. If things seem too heavy or negative, seek out the things that uplift you.</p>

      <p>When it comes to a plan that you've been working on, you may need to start focusing on the things that you want to see happen instead of the things that you don't. Talking to someone that's supportive or encouraging can help. Too, in what way can your words be a balm for others?</p>

      <p>In terms of your success and sense of fulfillment, know that it's less about you doing things perfectly and more about you doing things that feel true to who you are. People appreciate authenticity and that's exactly what you need to bring to the world. Being yourself inspires others.</p>

      <p>You might receive a positive indication of how well you're doing with a financial plan or an improved approach to your money. This could be connected to a home related matter or your path to financial security. Meanwhile, when it comes to sharing with others, exercise some limits.</p>
