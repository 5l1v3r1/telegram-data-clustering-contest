      <h1>Bill Gates Voices Concern About Elizabeth Warren's Wealth Tax Proposal</h1>
      <h2>Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates on Wednesday criticized 2020 White House hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) wealth tax proposal, stating that it left him doing “a little math about what I have left over.”</h2>

      <p>“I’ve paid over $10 billion in taxes. I’ve paid more than anyone in taxes,” Gates, who has an estimated <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-to-lose-status-as-worlds-richest-man-as-amazon-stock-tumbles-105615138.html">networth</a> of $107 billion, said at the <i>New York Time</i>s DealBook conference. ”If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine.</p>

      <p>“But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, I’m just kidding,” he then quipped.</p>
      <p>Warren has vowed, if elected president, to double the top rate of her wealth tax to 6% from 3%, which would tax individuals 3 cents on every dollar over $1 billion in net worth.</p>
      <p>DealBook’s Andrew Sorkin asked Gates if he would be open to discussing alternate tax proposals with the Massachusetts Democrat, to which he replied: “I’m not sure how open-minded she is… or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.”</p>
      <p>Gates then went on to say that he did not want to make “political declarations” about whether he would support President Donald Trump or Warren for president in 2020.</p>
      <p>“I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach is even – as much as I disagree with some of the policy things that are out there, I do think a professional approach to the office – whoever I decide would have the more professional approach in the current situation probably will weigh, is the thing that I will weigh the most,” said Gates. “I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.”</p>
      <p>Warren took to Twitter shortly after Gates’s comment, tweeting that she would be happy to meet with Gates to “explain exactly how much you’d pay under my wealth tax”.</p>
