Bennett, 29, won three stages at the 2018 Giro d'Italia and two stages on this year's Tour of Spain.
""Over the last six years, Bora-Hansgrohe developed Sam Bennett into one of the best sprinters in the peloton,"" the team said in a statement.
""Against this background it however became more and more difficult to align the team's and rider's goals.
""Therefore, Bora-Hansgrohe's management has decided to accept Sam Bennett's wish to leave Bora-Hansgrohe and continue his journey with another team.""
