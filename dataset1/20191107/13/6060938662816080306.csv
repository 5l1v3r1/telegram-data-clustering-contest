RAJKOT: Stand-in India skipper Rohit Sharma achieved a rare feat on Thursday when he took the field in the second T20I of the three-match series against Bangladesh at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Rajkot. Rohit became the first Indian men player and second globally in men's cricket to feature in 100 T20I games.
Pakistan's Shoaib Malik (111 T20Is) is the only player to have played more than 100 games in the shortest format of the game at the international level.
Speaking on achieving the milestone, Rohit said: ""Firstly, I never thought I would play so many games. I am grateful for the opportunity I got in the past and till date as well. It has been a long journey since I made my debut as there had been many ups and downs. I have now understood my game. Yes, I am very happy where I stand right now.""



He also admitted playing the 100th T20I game for India was a moment of pride for him.
Termed as 'Hitman', Rohit has slammed four centuries in the shortest format of the game. However, he said he is not very keen to term any particular knock as a 'special' one and whatever innings results in winning cause makes him happy.
""I can't rate any of the knock as special. I have never been fond of rating any particular knock as I love all my knocks,"" he expressed. ""I look forward to many more memorable knocks as well,"" Rohit added.



Rohit has been prolific in T20Is, scoring 2452 runs with four hundreds to his name and 17 fifties before this match. On Sunday, the Mumbai batsman reclaimed the top spot in the list of highest run-scorer in T20Is during the first game against the Bangla Tigers at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.
Rohit has been trading the top spot with regular skipper Virat Kohli for some time now and it was the latter who was leading the chart with 2,450 runs to his name. Rohit was eight runs behind Kohli going into the first T20I against Bangladesh, and he had closed the gap in the first over of the game.
