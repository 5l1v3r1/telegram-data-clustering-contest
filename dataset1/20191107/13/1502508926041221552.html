      <p>The government is examining a possibility for setting up of a regulatory authority for the e-commere sector, a senior official said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Domestic traders have time and again demanded for a regulator to monitor the sector and act against online retail companies flouting norms.</p>
      <p>The official in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said that they are currently working on a policy for e-commerce sector and are examining several issues under that.</p>
      <p>"One of the ideas floated as a part of this exercise is whether there's a need for any regulatory authority for e-commerce. It is not a decision because the policy is yet to be finalised, but one of the many suggestions that we are examining," the official added.</p>
      <p>Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) have pressed for formation of a regulatory authority empowered to act against companies flouting norms.</p>
      <p>They have alleged that e-commerce companies are following unethical business models and are infringing on the foreign direct investment (FDI) norms.</p>
      <p>They have also alleged that these firms are involved in predatory pricing, deep discounting, loss funding, and exclusivity of various products which are not allowed under the FDI policy.</p>
      <p>The government in February released the draft national e-commerce policy proposing setting up a legal and technological framework for restrictions on cross-border data flow and also laid out conditions for businesses regarding collection or processing of sensitive data locally and storing it abroad.</p>
