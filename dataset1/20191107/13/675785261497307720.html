      <p>A man has been given a 22-year sentence after carrying out a prolonged campaign of physical and sexual abuse against a toddler.</p>
      <p>Kane Fanelli subjected the victim to a protracted campaign of abuse between May 2018 and June 2018.</p>
      <p>The child, who has now been safeguarded, suffered a catalogue of traumatic injuries including bruising, swelling, bite marks, burns, cuts and abrasions.</p>
      <p>On Sunday 1 July 2018, when the victim who lived in Watford, was just 18 months old, he was taken to hospital with an injury.</p>
      <p>After doctors conducted a thorough physical examination, they discovered a large number of other painful injuries they deemed non-accidental and the police were called.</p>
      <p>One of the paediatricians who assessed the victim said that ‘in over 25 years of paediatric practice he had rarely seen such extensive injuries in a child’ and that it was ‘fortuitous he was alive’.</p>
      <p>The victim was given medical treatment to relieve his pain before being immediately placed under police protection.</p>
      <p>Fanelli of Clover Close, Luton, was convicted after a seven-week trial at St Albans Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Detective constable Caroline Bright, from Hertfordshire Constabulary’s Joint Child Protection Investigation Team, said: “This was the most challenging and gruelling case I have ever investigated and first and foremost, my thoughts are with the little boy.</p>
      <p>"He is now finally safe from his abuser and I can only hope the inexplicable cruelty he suffered does not have a far-reaching impact on the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>“During his campaign of torture, Fanelli showed himself to be a significant and dangerous risk to children.</p>
      <p>"He consistently displayed a complete disregard for the wellbeing of an innocent toddler.</p>
      <p>“I am satisfied with Fanelli’s custodial sentence and am glad he will no longer pose a danger to children now he is behind bars.”</p>
      <p>After serving an 18-year custodial sentence, Fanelli will serve an additional four years on extended licence.</p>
      <p>He will be assessed prior to release from prison to ensure he no longer poses a danger to the community.</p>
      <p>His name will appear on the Sex Offenders’ Register indefinitely and he will also be subject to a lifetime Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) with a number of terms which prevent him having contact with any child under the age of 16.</p>
      <p>Fanelli is prohibited from contacting the victim, who is now three years old and thriving in foster care.</p>
