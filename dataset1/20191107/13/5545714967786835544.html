      <h1>Rockstar continues to patch its problematic launcher for Red Dead Redemption 2</h1>
      <h2>Stability</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Carter</a></address>
      <p>While some folks are able to get into the newly minted <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> PC port without issue, a lot of folks can't.</p>
      <p>Issues are piling up that include Anti-Virus incompatibility, Vulkan setting problems (swap to DirectX12), and as I mentioned in my impressions piece, optimization troubles. But it seems like the main culprit isn't necessarily the game itself, but the new proprietary Rockstar launcher that popped into existence a few months back.</p>
      <p>Who would have thought that a mandatory brand new launcher for what is ostensibly a very huge and potentially bug-prone game could have done this? Either way, expect at least a week of rockiness for <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> PC if you don't have a top-end machine.</p>
      <p>You can find the full patch notes below for 1.14, as well as additional updates beyond the scope of the launcher.</p>
