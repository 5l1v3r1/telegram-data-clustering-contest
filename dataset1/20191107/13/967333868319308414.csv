The tech giant confirmed it is aware of the problem and is working to resolve it. The app appears to be broken across most major platforms, while other Amazon services (including Alexa) seem to be operating properly.

According to numerous reports, hundreds of users have not been able to connect to the Amazon Prime Video app. It apparently went down on Thursday morning. Media outlets have suggested that Amazon Prime Video was not working in the UK as late as 9:45 a.m. GMT.



Most of the affected users are from the UK and other European countries, however, according to online tracker Down Detector, the US is also experiencing certain technical problems, although it is nighttime or very early morning in the country.



Amazon Prime Video is an internet video-on-demand service, created by the company in 2006. At the moment, it covers around 26 million users across the globe.
