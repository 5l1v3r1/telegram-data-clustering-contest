When you think about Android phones, what comes to mind? Maybe it's how customizable the user experience is right out of the box, or perhaps the endless options of devices you have to choose from thanks to the platform's open-source nature.

Mike Dee 11-03-2019 04:23 PM I don't keep a device long enough to matter and I stopped rooting after OEMs basically eliminated lag in their devices, but I agree.
