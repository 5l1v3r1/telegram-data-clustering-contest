      <p>Rumour continue to suggest that FC Barcelona are working on a deal to bring Marcelo Gallardo to replace Ernesto Valverde in the future. Argentinian outlets have spoken about this interest and it's spread across the world of football. However, SPORT can reveal that Barça haven't contacted Gallardo or anyone close to the coach because there are no plans to replace Valverde.</p>
      <p>Some reports have even suggested that Lionel Messi is the one who put forward Gallardo for the role. This is based on the fact Leo named the River Plate coach in his shortlist of the top coaches for The Best awards, Sources close to the player have told SPORT that those reports are incorrect. Messi insists that he has never had a say in who coaches the club, not even Tata Martino.</p>
      <p>These rumours will only grow if the poor results continue to come. So far, Gallardo and Koeman are the main names being linked with the Camp Nou hot seat. At the moment, Barça aren't considering any imminent changes in the dugout.</p>
