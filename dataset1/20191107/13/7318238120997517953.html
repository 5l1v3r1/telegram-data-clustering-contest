      <p>Supporters of Bolivian president Evo Morales have been involved in violent clashes with supporters of rival presidential candidates in the city of Cochabamba.</p>
      <p>Firing sticks of dynamite and hurling rocks, the Morales supporters kept their rivals at bay under the watchful eye of the police.</p>
      <p>In La Paz, anti-Morales protesters taunted the president by offering a letter of resignation and promised to continue their action until he leaves government.</p>
      <p>"We are here marching against the biggest fraud," said protester Fared Paredes who marched peacefully through the streets with others.</p>
      <p>Opponents challenge the official result of October 20 elections that showed Morales winning by a margin big enough to avoid the need for a runoff against a united opposition.</p>
      <p>Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, accuses the opposition of trying to stage a coup.</p>
