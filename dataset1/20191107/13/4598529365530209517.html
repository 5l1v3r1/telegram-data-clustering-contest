      <p>As President Donald Trump’s team braces for public impeachment inquiry <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/taylor-kent-yovanovitch-will-be-first-public-impeachment-testimonies-next-week">testimonies</a> beginning next week, they’ve focused much of their trepidation on the first witness in particular: Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/politics/donald-trump-impeachment-public-hearings/index.html">According to CNN,</a> the White House is wary of the combination of Taylor’s credibility — longtime and current State Department official, veteran, personally recruited by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — and the damning information he first conveyed behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Trump is so anxious about the upcoming testimony that he barked at Pompeo for hiring Taylor in the first place, a rare rebuke for one of Trump’s preferred secretaries.</p>
      <p>Taylor’s closed-door testimony was one of the most <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bil-taylor-three-reveals-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo">damning</a> days for Trump during the impeachment inquiry so far, as he detailed the quid pro quo at the heart of the Ukraine pressure campaign.</p>
