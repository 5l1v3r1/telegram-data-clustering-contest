Kilmarnock boss Angelo Alessio has scooped the Ladbrokes Premiership manager of the month award for October.
The Italian guided the Ayrshire side to three wins in a row in October before his 10 men narrowly lost at Motherwell in the last game of the month.
The month started brightly with a 1-0 win at Tynecastle as a Chris Burke header, which could also have been argued as an own goal, put Hearts to the sword.

Next up was a 2-1 victory at Rugby Park over Livingston as goals from Gary Dicker and Rory McKenzie were enough to combat a late Lee Miller strike.
Then a week later captain Dicker scored again as he helped the side to a 1-0 victory at home to St Mirren.
Killie lost Alex Bruce after just 12 minutes at Fir Park as they went down 2-1 to Motherwell.
A Dom Thomas equaliser after a Liam Donnelly opener wasn't enough to take anything back home as Devante Cole's header sealed all three points for the Steelmen.
