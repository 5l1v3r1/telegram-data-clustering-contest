（中央社記者楊啟芳台中7日電）世界棒球12強賽B組已經確定由中華隊及日本晉級，今天兩隊將正面對決，中華隊推出廖乙忠先發，日本則是左投今永昇太掛帥，奪下勝利的一方就能成為分組第一，帶1勝進入複賽。
中華隊昨天在先發投手張奕7局好投率領下，以3比0擊退委內瑞拉，奪下2連勝；日本隊則是以4比0擊敗波多黎各，同樣取得2連勝，預賽B組由台灣及日本出線。今天晚間6時30分兩隊將對戰，爭取分組第一，能帶1勝進入超級循環賽。
中華隊推出來自中信兄弟的廖乙忠先發主投，他去年雖然參與中華職棒季中選秀落選，不過以自主培訓的身分加入兄弟，今年下半季就得到一軍先發輪值機會，總計投13場都是先發，拿下3勝5敗，防禦率4.36，總冠軍賽也奪下勝投。
由於兄弟主場就是在洲際棒球場，廖乙忠表示，會將這場比賽當作例行賽來投，「每一顆球都全力投，不要想說自己是先發就保留實力，後面好的投手很多」。預賽尚未亮相的胡智為，也會在牛棚待命，他表示，「會讓自己緊急要上場時，能馬上準備好。」
日本隊則是推出左投今永昇太先發，之前日本媒體就曾預測過今永昇太會對戰中華隊，他來自橫濱DeNA灣星隊，本季在一軍出賽25場，包含3場完封勝，拿下13勝7敗，防禦率2.91。
今永昇太除了有150公里以上速球，還有滑球、變速球、曲球、卡特球等多樣變化球種，曾在2017年亞洲職棒冠軍爭霸賽代表日本隊出賽，當時與中職聯隊交手，先發投6局飆12次三振，讓台灣打者吃足苦頭。他日前曾表示，「希望可以投出好成績，讓中華隊打者看看自己的成長」。（編輯：方沛清）1081107
