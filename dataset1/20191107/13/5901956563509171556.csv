Mamo, očeta in sina je Lenki vzel rak
Očim ji je delal, kar se ženskam dela.
07 Nov 2019, 13:22 by A. L.
Ko je bila majhna, je Lenka s štirimi sestrami in z bratom ostala brez očeta. Kriv je bil rak. Že mladi so morali na polje, tako je sama pobirala krompir že pri šestih. Šola ni bila v prvem planu. Zjutraj pred njo so bili v hlevu, popoldne pa na polju. Zaradi vonja, ki so se ga navzeli od živali, so jih klicali 'gnojšeki'.Nekaj let kasneje je mama spoznala novega partnerja in Lenka je pri devetih dobila očima. Sprva se je zdelo vse dobro, nato pa se je prvič zgodilo, da je sestra zbolela. Ostala je doma, očim pa z njo. Ko se je Lenka z mamo vrnila s polja, je bilo s sestro res slabo. Jokala je in bruhala. Ne glede na to, da še ni bila zdrava, je naslednjič vseeno raje odšla z njima delat, kot da bi ostala doma. Zakaj, je spoznala kmalu, ko je vročino dobila sama. Mama jo je spraševala, mar ne bi šla raje z njima delat, a je želela ostati doma in brati. Okoli poldneva pa se je zgodilo. Očim je smrdeč po alkoholu vstopil in ji naredil, kar se dela ženskam. Bolelo jo je, on pa ji je zabičal, če bo povedala mami, ji bo »gobec razbil pa meni tudi«. Mama je pešala, kriva je bila bolezen in enkrat se je z dela prej vrnila domov. Lenko je zalotila z njim in ga poskušala pregnati, tudi s ponovijo. A bila je šibka. Z roko jo je odrinil v steno, nekaj dni kasneje je mama umrla. Kriv da je bil krvni rak, tako kot že pri očetu. S sestro Jero so ju ločili, vsaka je odšla k svoji novi družini.Novo življenje Lenki ni prineslo nič dobrega. Tepli so jo, na mamin grob je niso pustili, skrbnik pa ji je počel, kar ji je očim. Zato je pri 16 letih pobegnila. Na poti je spoznala moškega, ki jo je vzel k sebi. »Samo za ženo sem morala biti. Tega sem bila že vajena. Če nisem bila, me je pretepel,« se je izpovedala. Dobila sta tudi otroka, malega Jožija. Ko je njen partner prvič položil roko nanj, je odšla: »Sem si rekla, Lenko lahko 'gajžvajo', Jožija pa ne!«Najprej so jima pomagale nune, sama je denar služila, ko je čistila po hišah, Joži pa se je počasi izšolal in začel tudi služiti. Spoznal je dekle in jo pripeljal domov. Lenke snaha, s katero je Joži imel dva otroka, ni preveč marala. A za voljo vnučkov je potrpela, Joži pa je vse bolj pešal. Tudi njega je vzel krvni rak: »Še ohladil se ni, pa je mlada šla z bankirjem iz službe.«Lenka je ostala sama. S slabimi 300 evrov pokojnine pozimi ne more pokriti niti vseh položnic. Ko so jo iz društva Humanitarček obiskali, je bila v stanovanju brez elektrike, želodček si je polnila z juhami za nekaj centov. Navadno jo je razredčila, da jo je jedla par dni in si ob njej privoščila še kakšen kos kruha: »Pri 78 ne rabim več. Duša me boli. Ponoči sanjam očka pa rejnika. Če se spomnim, me boli.«Ko so Lenki prišli na pomoč, je le jokala. Želela si je le rož, da jih nese na mamin in Jožijev grob.Lenkino življenjsko zgodbo je objavilo društvo Humanitarček v sklopu projektVida, glasbeno, družbeno odgovornega projekta, ki daje glas pozabljenim starostnikom.

Mother, father and son were taken by Lenki for cancer
My stepfather did what women do.
07 Nov 2019, 13:22 by A.L.
When she was little, Lenka, with four sisters and a brother, lost her father. Cancer was to blame. The young had to go to the field, so she was picking potatoes at six. School was not in the foreground. In the morning before her they were in the stable, and in the afternoon in the field. Because of the odor that came from the animals, they were called 'pus'. A few years later, the mother met a new partner and Lenka got her eyes at nine. At first everything seemed fine, but then it happened for the first time that her sister had become ill. She stayed home, with her stepfather with her. When Lenka and her mother returned from the field, it was really bad with my sister. She was crying and vomiting. Even though she was not yet healthy, she would rather go to work with them next time than stay home. Why, she realized soon after she got the fever on her own. Her mother asked her if she would rather not work with them, but she wanted to stay home and read. Around noon, however, it happened. The stepfather, by the smell of alcohol, went in and did what was done to women. She was hurting, and he was yelling at her if she told her mother, ""her muzzle will break me, too."" Mom was walking, her illness was to blame, and she returned home from work once. Lenko caught up with him and tried to drive him away, even with a repeat. And she was weak. He pushed her into the wall with his hand, and a few days later his mother died. He was guilty of blood cancer, just like his father. She and her sister Jero were separated, each leaving for their new family. Lenka's new life did nothing good. They beat her, they did not let her go to her mother's grave, and the guardian did her thing to her stepfather. That's why she escaped at the age of 16. Along the way, she met a man who had taken her to him. “I just had to be for my wife. I was used to this already. If I wasn’t, he beat me, ”she confessed. They also got a baby, little Jozi. When her partner put her hand on her for the first time, she went, ""I told myself, Lenka can be 'mugged', but Jozia could not!"" First, the nuns helped them; he went to school and began to serve. He met the girl and brought her home. Lenka's daughter-in-law, with whom Jozi had two children, did not care too much. However, she suffered for her grandchildren's will, and Jozi was increasingly walking. He was also taken by blood cancer: ""He has not cooled down yet, the bride went with a bank teller from work."" Lenka was left alone. With just under $ 300 a pension in winter, he can't cover all the money orders. When she was visited by the Humanitarček Society, she was in an apartment without electricity, filling her stomach with soups for a few cents. She usually diluted it to eat for a couple of days and had another piece of bread with her: “At 78 I don't need it anymore. My soul hurts. At night, I dream of Daddy being a foster parent. If I remember, it hurts me. ”When Lenki came to the rescue, she just cried. All she wanted was flowers to bear on Mom's and Jozi's grave. Lenka's life story was published by the Humanitarček Society as part of ProjectVida, a musical, socially responsible project that gives voice to forgotten old people.
