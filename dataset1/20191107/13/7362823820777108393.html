      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> woman whose home was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">burglarized</a> last month is pleading with the thief to return a small green box that contained the ashes of her late husband.</p>
      <p>Liz Liposky, 76, had been away from her South Amboy home since Oct. 24. She returned on Halloween to hand out candy to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-girl-9-sustains-several-fractures-while-trick-or-treating-after-strong-winds-topple-over-tree">trick-or-treaters</a> in the neighborhood only to find that her door had been kicked in and her home burglarized, family members told <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NJ-Family-Pleads-for-Burglar-to-Return-Stolen-Ashes-564594671.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">NBC New York</a>.</p>

      <p>Alon with several items of jewelry, including a commemorative wedding band, Liposky discovered that the thief had taken a small green box containing the ashes of her husband Michael Liposky, who passed away in 2011 from cancer, the victim's niece Jamie Stratton told <a href="https://abc7ny.com/burglar-steals-ashes-of-womans-late-husband-from-nj-home/5673933/">WABC</a> this week.</p>

      <p>"By this point, they have to have known that it's not jewelry," she said. "It's the remains of someone, whether it be a pet or your loved one. Just bring him back.</p>
      <p>"It's killing her deep inside."</p>
      <p>Stratton said that the ashes were held in a small box put inside a larger box placed near a funeral card.</p>
