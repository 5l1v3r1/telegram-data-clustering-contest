Wisconsin Assembly to vote on 3 overrides of Evers vetoes

07 Nov 2019, 13:42

MADISON, Wis. -  The Wisconsin Assembly will vote on overriding three of Gov. Tony Evers' budget vetoes.
Thursday's votes will mark the first time since 2010 that the Legislature has tried to override the veto of a governor. No veto override has succeeded since 1985.
One of the targeted vetoes killed $15 million in funding to create a northern Wisconsin regional mental health crisis center. Another one blocked $5 million a year for doctors who care for people in state health care programs. The third gave the Evers administration more flexibility in how to spend $500,000 to increase the number of health care providers.
Republicans will need Democratic votes to be successful in the override, but no Democrats are expected to vote for it. The Senate would also have to go along.
