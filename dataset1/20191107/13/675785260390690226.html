      <p>A man who joined a group fighting ISIS terrorists has been jailed for four years.</p>
      <p>Aidan James, 28, is the first Brit to be punished for travelling to fight against Islamic State.</p>
      <p>The British Army reject was charged after attending a Kurdish militant training camp in Iraq.</p>
      <p>The man from Formby, in Merseyside had travelled to train with the banned Marxist political organisation the PKK in Iraq.</p>
      <p>He had no previous military knowledge when he set out to join the war in 2017, the Old Bailey previously heard.</p>
      <p>Following a landmark trial, James, who was repeatedly turned down by British armed forces due to his mental health, was found guilty of training in weapons with the PKK.</p>
      <p>But he was cleared of a second charge of attending a place of terror training with Kurdish YPG units, or "People's Protection Units," across the border in Syria.</p>

      <p>The defendant, who is in custody, has appeared today at the Old Bailey.</p>
      <p>Justice Edis to sentenced him to four years in prison.</p>
      <p>It is the first time a Brit has been put on trial for going to Syria to oppose IS, after charges were dropped against ex-soldier James Matthews, 43, from Dalston, east London.</p>
      <p>The court had heard how Aidan James was in contact with the anti-terror Prevent programme before he left Britain for Iraq in August 2017.</p>
      <p>While there, he wrote in his diary that sitting on a roof with a 50 calibre machine gun was like something out of "Mad Max".</p>
      <p>By December, he wrote that the situation with Turkey was worsening, saying: " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-daesh-mean-isis-threatens-6841468">Daesh</a> is the biggest threat the world has seen since Hitler so anything I can do in these operations is good."</p>
      <p>Later, as he prepared to come home, James wrote in his diary of his "amazing time".</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Lost good friends, met great ones, fought on front line numerous times, killed Daesh soldiers, been shot at many times by Isis and our own guys.</p>
      <p>"Drove humvys (sic), sat on roof as drove through desert, attacked by suicide vehicles many times, mortar fire, sniper RPG, drones, chilled with donkey."</p>
      <p>The court heard he finally returned to Liverpool John Lennon Airport on February 14 last year on flights via Baghdad, Amman and Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>James declined to give evidence but denied training with PKK terrorists in Mahkmour, Iraq on or before October 1 2017 and attending another place for training in Syria with YPG units on or before November 4 2017.</p>
