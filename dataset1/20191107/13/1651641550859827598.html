      <p>Microsoft announced the Surface Pro X along with Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3 at their annual Surface Event in October. Among the new Surface hardware announced at the event, the Surface Pro X was the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-goes-on-sale-today/">last one to go on sale</a>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/surface-pro-x-review-roundup-not-the-kind-of-pro-youd-like-to-have/">early reviews</a> of the Surface Pro X weren’t as good as what Microsoft had hoped for.</p>
      <p>The good news is, Surface Pro X scored well in one department, which is serviceability. This year Microsoft made a point of making <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ifixits-teardown-of-surface-laptop-3-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-replace-ssd-and-other-components/">Surface devices a little better in terms of repairability</a> and Surface Pro X is no exception. Just days after the device went on sale, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+X+Teardown/127703">iFixit</a> grabbed their tools to pop open the Surface Pro X. The device managed to score a decent 6 out of 10 on their repairability scale which is better than the previous <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/surface-go-gets-ifixit-teardown-scores-1/">Surface Go</a>. The teardown can be summarised using the following bullet points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The user-removable SSD makes for easy upgrades and data security that doesn’t require device destruction.</li>
        <li>To the extent that screws are used, they are all standard Torx fasteners.</li>
        <li>Many components are modular and can be replaced independently.</li>
        <li>(Almost) all repairs require display removal, with an improved procedure that needs no heat, but necessitates careful prying.</li>
        <li>The battery is firmly glued in place, with its connector pinned under the motherboard—requiring near-total disassembly for service.</li>
        <li>The SSD is truly user-replaceable, requiring only a SIM eject pin and a T3 driver—no need to remove the screen. That’s awesome to see in such a slim form factor. As a bonus, it’s the same SSD as in the Laptop 3, meaning more standardization and better support from third parties.</li>
        <li>In a first for tablets, the display is held down with friendly foam adhesive that doesn’t require heat or solvents to remove.</li>
        <li>A funky jumper cable clings to the back of the main board, and it’s labeled “New SAM”—which could stand for Slippery Agile Meerkat.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The better design and easy access to the components allowed Surface Pro X to get 6. While Microsoft can still improve on a little to make it more repairable, the Surface Pro X is still better than the old Surface devices.</p>
