      <p>Jordan Nobbs and Beth England have said they want the English FA to become the next country to strike a deal that closes the pay gap between the men's and women's national teams.</p>
      <p>Australian <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/football.html">football</a>'s governing body said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with the players' union on a new collective bargaining agreement that "closes the pay gap" between the Socceroos and Matildas.</p>
      <p>New Zealand and Norway have already moved to address the pay gap between their male and female players.</p>
      <p>"When you see other nations doing it, of course, we want to carry on that progression with our nation," Arsenal midfielder Nobbs told BBC.</p>
      <p>England host Germany at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, which could set a record attendance for a women's international in the UK.</p>
      <p>The Lionesses finished fourth at this year's World Cup in France but Chelsea forward England said they still needed to work towards building steady revenue streams off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"It's one of them where we have been better than [the men] so why are we not on the same [pay] as them, in a way?" she said.</p>
      <p>"But, again, look at the revenue that the men bring in and you can't really compare it because their standard is relatively higher than the women - so it's going to be an ongoing battle and a long process."</p>
