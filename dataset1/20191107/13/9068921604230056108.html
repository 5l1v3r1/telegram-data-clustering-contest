      <p>iOS and ‌iPadOS‌ 13.2.2 are minor updates focusing on performance improvements and bug fixes for issues that were not able to be addressed in iOS 13.2 rather than major outward facing changes. <br/><br/>According to Apple's release notes, the update fixes an issue that could cause apps running in the background to unexpectedly quit, which led to background apps refreshing more often than normal. These frequent app refreshes of Safari, YouTube, and other media apps, led to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/31/ios-13-2-safari-refreshing-poor-ram-management/">multiple user complaints</a>. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-multitasking-bug-fix/">addressed this problem</a> in the iOS 13.3 beta too. <br/><br/>The update also resolves an issue where the iPhone could lose cellular service after a call, and it fixes a bug that caused cellular data to be temporarily unavailable. Apple's full release notes for the update are below:</p>
      <blockquote>iOS 13.2.2 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update: <br/><br/>- Fixes an issue that could cause apps to quit unexpectedly when running in the background <br/>- Resolves an issue where iPhone may temporarily lose cellular service after a call <br/>- Addresses an issue where cellular data may temporarily not be available <br/>- Fixes an issue that caused replies to S/MIME encrypted email messages between Exchange accounts to be unreadable <br/>- Addresses an issue where using Kerberos single sign-on service in Safari may present an authentication prompt <br/>- Resolves an issue where charging may be interrupted on YubiKey Lightning-powered accessories</blockquote>
      <p>The release notes for the ‌iPadOS‌ 13.2.2 update are the same, with the exception of the fix for cellular issues.</p>
