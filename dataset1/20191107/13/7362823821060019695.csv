A North Carolina high school teacher recently charged with having sex with a student was found dead in her home on Wednesday along with her husband, according to officials.
The Huntersville Police Department said the bodies of Emma Ogle, 63, and her husband, 59-year-old Michael Ogle, were discovered by members of a SWAT team shortly after they made entry into the couple's home in Huntersville, located north of Charlotte.
""It's a very unfortunate situation,"" Huntersville Police Officer Odette Saglimbeni said at a news conference. ""It's not a very common thing that we see here in Huntersville, so when it happens it's shocking.""

Authorities responded to the home after receiving a call around 8 a.m. about a ""barricaded suspect"" inside, according to officials.
Before the call was made, Huntersville police said Ogle had not shown up at work in the morning and was not answering calls, which prompted a family relative to go to the home to check on him. When the family member arrived at the home, they noticed Emma Ogle with a handgun and her husband dead inside.
""The information we have is that she was still alive when the family member got there and her husband was not,"" Saglimbeni told reporters.

Police said they tried to make multiple attempts to contact the 63-year-old until going in at 9:51 a.m. and discovering the bodies of the couple inside. The two were found dead from apparent gunshot wounds, according to Saglimbeni.
While the deaths appeared to be an apparent murder-suicide, the Huntersville Police Department said the deaths are still under investigation.
