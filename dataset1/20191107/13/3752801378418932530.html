      <p>Between 10 and 15 people, including a three-year-old, have been treated after a structural collapse on West Street near Warwick Junction in the Durban CBD on Thursday, paramedic services said.</p>
      <p>Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said they arrived on the scene around midday and had to start treating the injured immediately.</p>
      <p>"The building has collapsed onto the floor below. There is quite bad damage and there are people still in the premises. We are treating... patients including an approximately three-year-old child."</p>
      <p>There were no major injuries, Jamieson said. The fire department was also on the scene.</p>
      <p>"Paramedics and the fire department are removing patients. They had to break a door down to [start to] remove patients. All appear to be accounted for. A sweep is being done."</p>
