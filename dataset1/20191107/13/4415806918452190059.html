      <p>The mother of a seven-year-old girl who was left with part of her skull exposed after a dog attack has praised the “magic hands” of the surgeons who patched her back together.</p>
      <p>Sophie Evans, from Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England was left covered in blood and with bite wounds across her face and scalp after she was attacked by a German Shepherd dog in January.</p>
      <p>Sophie’s mother, Lyndsey, 34, described her horror at finding her daughter with injuries so deep that the bones were exposed on her head.</p>

      <p>Mrs Evans said: “I got a phone call at work to say Sophie had been attacked and I was heartbroken when I saw her.</p>
      <p>“To this day, I cannot believe how brave she was when I arrived, she just held out her hand and said ‘mummy, I’m OK’.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Evans, said Sophie was taken to a local hospital but then transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital’s emergency department.</p>

      <p>She said that Sophie’s nine-year-old brother Jack saw the attack and began to worry that she would not survive.</p>
      <p>“I’m used to seeing people on their worst days but nothing can prepare you for being on the other side as a parent,” said Mrs Evans, who is a receptionist in a hospital emergency department.</p>
      <p>Sophie was treated by the emergency team before spending four-and-a-half hours in surgery the next morning.</p>
      <p>She was discharged two days later and Sophie was back at Kingsoak Primary School, in Wombwell, within three weeks.</p>

      <p>Mrs Evans said: “All the staff who helped us were absolutely amazing, words will never be enough to explain how forever grateful we will be.</p>
      <p>“On the worst day of our lives, they made sure we were all looked after and reassured.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to the magic hands of the emergency department team, her scars are barely noticeable today. They fixed my Sophie up and she is perfect to us once again.”</p>
      <p>The family has now devoted themselves to fundraising for The Children’s Hospital Charity’s £4.5 million appeal to build a new emergency department at Sheffield Children’s Hospital.</p>
      <p>Jack has already begun the effort, running his first-ever 10K alongside his dad – security officer Rob, 37 – and raising £800 towards the appeal.</p>
      <p>David Vernon-Edwards, director of The Children’s Hospital Charity, said the emergency department was built to see a maximum of 32,000 patients every year but last year saw almost 57,000.</p>
      <p>In addition to the expanded waiting room and clinical space, the redevelopment will also build a dedicated space for children with mental health issues or learning difficulties and a separate area for adolescents.</p>
      <p>Mr Vernon-Edwards said: “We’re so thankful to Sophie’s family for sharing their story and to her brother, Jack, for his fantastic fundraising.”</p>
