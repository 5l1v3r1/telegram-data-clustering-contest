      <p>Conservative London Assembly member Tony Devenish blamed Transport for London’s (TfL) revenue losses on the overcrowding.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cityam.com/rory-stewart-signals-potential-fare-rise-as-he-slams-tfl-losses-under-sadiq-khan/">TfL is expected to make a £742m loss in 2019-20</a> on the back of Khan’s fare freeze and expensive bus subsidies.</p>
      <p>Devenish said: “By depriving TfL of much-need revenue through his flawed partial fares freeze…the mayor has severely restricted the amount of money available for much-needed infrastructure upgrades.”</p>
      <p>Khan announced a four-year TfL fare freeze for individual journeys as a part of his campaign for mayor in 2016.</p>
      <p>The freeze was in contrast to Boris Johnson’s time as mayor of London when prices rose by 42 per cent over eight years.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Khan said the policy made public transport “more affordable for millions of Londoners”.</p>
      <p>They added: “He is also investing record amounts in modernising and increasing capacity on London’s Tube network.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>“This includes the huge transformation of Bank station, the Northern Line Extension, major new signalling on the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines, and investing in major upgrades to stations such as Finsbury Park.”</p>
      <p>Independent mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has indicated he would likely raise TfL fares if elected and Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey has also said a fare rise would be a “done deal” under him.</p>
      <p>Stewart told <i>City A.M. </i>on Tuesday it “cannot make sense to be running a system that’s losing this much money every year”.</p>
      <p>“Under Boris Johnson, TfL was generating a lot of money for the city a lot of time, but for various reasons – not all his fault – TfL under [Khan] has been losing money,” he said.</p>
      <p>TfL and Khan were contacted for comment.</p>
