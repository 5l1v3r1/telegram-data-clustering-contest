As President Donald Trump’s team braces for public impeachment inquiry testimonies beginning next week, they’ve focused much of their trepidation on the first witness in particular: Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor.

Trump is so anxious about the upcoming testimony that he barked at Pompeo for hiring Taylor in the first place, a rare rebuke for one of Trump’s preferred secretaries.
Taylor’s closed-door testimony was one of the most damning days for Trump during the impeachment inquiry so far, as he detailed the quid pro quo at the heart of the Ukraine pressure campaign.
