為何5G的推出伴隨間諜疑雲 發展現狀怎樣

07 Nov 2019, 13:27

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】全球電信公司正在引入5G無線技術，有望為移動服務帶來創新。這是十年來全球手機網絡的首次重大升級，也帶來新一輪全球技術競賽。但伴隨著5G推出的另一個議題是間諜和安全疑慮，這是為什麼呢？
5G時代即將來臨，5G應用也成為焦點，無人駕駛、無人機、智能工廠、智能醫療、智能城市等領域都將因為5G的高速、延遲減少、大規模設備連接的特性，從而迅速發展。但建造5G的競賽也聚焦在其安全性上，特別是包括華為在內的中國公司帶來的間諜和安全風險。
瑞典無線設備製造商愛立信AB表示，到2024年，移動網絡承載的數據量將是今天的五倍，而5G網絡將覆蓋全球40%以上的人口。據估計，到2024年，將有超過220億個小工具連接到物聯網。
1. 什麼是5G？5G代表第五代移動網絡或第五代無線系統，是4G的後繼產品。5G最終速度可能是其前代產品的100倍，數據速度達到每秒10Gbps。消費者可以在幾秒鐘內下載完整的高清電影。
5G架構的設計是可以大幅提高速度的原因之一。在5G架構中，本地可以處理一些數據，而不必將所有數據通過核心網絡傳回。
2. 5G已經開始使用了嗎？5G尚在初始階段，韓國在4月份啟用了全國性5G網絡，預計到年底將達到最高速度，日本緊隨其後。
美國運營商已經開始提供有限的服務：Verizon Communications Inc.計劃年底之前在30個城市部署5G，而AT＆T Inc.則表示在2020年中期在全國範圍內提供5G服務。
英國運營商計劃在2019年提供有限的5G服務，而德國則希望5G能推動其行業在數字化轉型方面的實力。

3. 5G何時會成為新常態？尚需數年時間。即使生活在運營商已經開始提供5G服務的17個國家之中，5G完全普及至少要再等幾年時間。
三星搶在5G大規模商用前，積極佈局5G手機市場，至今已有4款5G手機面市。華為也推出5G手機。蘋果則可能到2020年才能提供兼容5G的iPhone。
4. 5G的安全隱患是什麼？隨著5G技術從醫院到運輸系統及發電廠各個方面的涉入，5G網絡將迅速成為每個國家關鍵基礎設施的一部分。這就使網絡出現問題或遭到故意攻擊、破壞行為的後果更加嚴重，也令各國政府更加擔憂。
5G不僅關係到信息保護的機密性，也關乎日常生活中所依賴的數據及系統的完整性和可用性。網絡越大，黑客攻擊的機會就越多，這意味著系統越來越複雜，需要保護的部件越來越多。
當前的衝突集中在華為。美國和其它一些國家擔心，因為中企無法擺脫中共政府的控制，中國產5G設備、芯片和軟件可能會帶有監視客戶的配備，這些中國設備會成為中共進入世界信息基礎設施的「特洛伊木馬」。

5. 關於華為的風險是什麼？美國政府希望讓美企遠離華為5G。2019年5月，美國總統川普（特朗普）採取行動遏制華為在美國銷售設備的能力，並將華為列入商務部出口管制黑名單。美國還力求說服其它國家放棄華為5G。
邁克‧羅傑斯（Mike Rogers）是美國國會眾議院情報常設專責委員會前主席。2012年由他領導的一個國會小組針對華為和中興對美國國家安全帶來的威脅，發表了一份調查報告。
該報告和近期美國情報機構的報告及分析顯示，華為是中共情報及國防機構的一個職能企業。羅傑斯說，根據中共法律，所有中國公司，無論身處何地，只要被中共要求提供數據，他們就必須服從。這個過程中，沒有法律程序或第三方的監督機制。
羅傑斯說，華為的5G計劃是中共的「中國製造2025」戰略計劃的一部分，目標是希望建造全球範圍內的5G主幹設備。這意味著，中共可以根據自己的需要，獲取和控制任何它們渴望的數據。
美國聯邦通信委員會（FCC）以國家安全為由，提議禁止電信業者用國家預算採購中興及華為的網路設備，並要拆除現有的中國產設備。這項提案預計11月19日投票。
去年澳大利亞禁止了華為和中興通訊為其電信運營商提供5G設備。
英國正計劃對供應商的系統進行更嚴格的監督；法國計劃對5G設備進行測試，這相當於對供應商提出一些要求。
德國媒體日前披露，德國政府做出決定，不排除華為參與本國5G網絡建設，政界、商界、媒體等都對此提出尖銳批評。
德國國會外交事務委員會主席羅特根（Norbert Röttgen，CDU）表示，「這不是我們是否信任華為的問題，而是我們是否信任中共，華為自然會服從中共的利益和要求。我們到底要誰來建立國家的數字網絡系統？這是國家安全問題，屬於憲法級別。」

Why is the launch of 5G accompanied by espionage cloud development status?

07 Nov 2019, 13:27

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Global telecommunications companies are introducing 5G wireless technology, which is expected to bring innovation to mobile services. This is the first major upgrade of the global mobile phone network in the past decade, and it has also brought a new round of global technology competition. But another issue that followed the launch of 5G is spying and security concerns. Why?
The 5G era is approaching, and 5G applications have also become the focus. Unmanned vehicles, drones, smart factories, smart medical care, smart cities and other fields will rapidly develop due to the high speed, delay reduction and large-scale equipment connection of 5G. But the 5G competition is also focused on its security, especially the spy and security risks brought by Chinese companies including Huawei.
Swedish wireless device manufacturer Ericsson AB said that by 2024, the mobile network will carry five times the amount of data, and the 5G network will cover more than 40% of the world's population. It is estimated that by 2024, there will be more than 22 billion gadgets connected to the Internet of Things.
1. What is 5G? 5G stands for the fifth generation mobile network or the fifth generation wireless system and is the successor of 4G. The final speed of 5G may be 100 times that of its predecessor, and the data speed is 10Gbps per second. Consumers can download full HD movies in seconds.
The design of the 5G architecture is one of the reasons why the speed can be greatly increased. In the 5G architecture, some data can be processed locally without having to pass all the data back through the core network.
2. Is 5G already in use? 5G is still in its infancy, and South Korea launched a national 5G network in April. It is expected to reach its peak speed by the end of the year, followed by Japan.
US carriers have begun offering limited services: Verizon Communications Inc. plans to deploy 5G in 30 cities by the end of the year, while AT&T Inc. said it will provide 5G services nationwide by mid-2020.
British operators plan to offer limited 5G services in 2019, while Germany hopes that 5G will drive the strength of its industry in digital transformation.

3. When will 5G become the new normal? It will take several years. Even in the 17 countries where operators have begun to provide 5G services, it will take at least a few more years for 5G to become fully popular.
Samsung grabbed the 5G mobile phone market before 5G large-scale commercial use, and so far 4 4G mobile phones have been available. Huawei also launched 5G mobile phones. Apple may not be able to offer a 5G compatible iPhone by 2020.
4. What are the security risks of 5G? As 5G technology moves from hospitals to transportation systems and power plants, 5G networks will quickly become part of every country's critical infrastructure. This has made the network more problematic or has been deliberately attacked, and the consequences of sabotaging behavior have become more serious, which has also caused more concern to governments.
5G is not only related to the confidentiality of information protection, but also to the data and system integrity and availability depended on in daily life. The larger the network, the more chances of hacking, which means that the system is more and more complex and more and more components need to be protected.
The current conflict is concentrated in Huawei. The United States and other countries are worried that because Chinese companies cannot get rid of the control of the Chinese government, China's 5G equipment, chips and software may be equipped with surveillance customers. These Chinese devices will become the ""Trojan horses"" of the CCP's access to the world's information infrastructure. .

5. What is the risk of Huawei? The US government wants to keep US companies away from Huawei 5G. In May 2019, US President Trump (Trump) took action to curb Huawei's ability to sell equipment in the United States and included Huawei in the Ministry of Commerce's export control blacklist. The United States also sought to persuade other countries to abandon Huawei 5G.
Mike Rogers is the former chairman of the US House of Representatives Intelligence Standing Committee. A congressional team led by him in 2012 published a report on the threats that Huawei and ZTE pose to US national security.
The report and recent US intelligence agencies report and analysis show that Huawei is a functional enterprise of the Chinese intelligence and defense agencies. According to the laws of the Chinese Communist Party, all Chinese companies, regardless of their location, must be obeyed if they are required by the CCP to provide data. There are no legal procedures or third-party monitoring mechanisms in this process.
Rogers said that Huawei's 5G plan is part of the CCP's ""Made in China 2025"" strategic plan, with the goal of building 5G backbone equipment worldwide. This means that the CCP can acquire and control any data they desire based on their own needs.
On the grounds of national security, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed to prohibit telecom operators from using the national budget to purchase ZTE and Huawei network equipment, and to dismantle existing Chinese-made equipment. This proposal is expected to vote on November 19.
Last year Australia banned Huawei and ZTE from providing 5G equipment to its telecom operators.
The UK is planning to impose stricter supervision on the supplier's system; France plans to test 5G equipment, which is equivalent to asking the supplier for some requirements.
The German media disclosed that the German government has made a decision not to rule out Huawei's participation in the construction of its 5G network. Political, business, and media have all made sharp criticisms.
Norbert Röttgen (CDU), chairman of the German Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ""This is not a question of whether we trust Huawei, but whether we trust the CCP. Huawei will naturally obey the interests and requirements of the CCP. Who do we want to build? National digital network system? This is a national security issue and belongs to the constitutional level.""
