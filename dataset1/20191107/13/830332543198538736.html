      <p>MADISON, Wis. -  The Wisconsin Assembly will vote on overriding three of Gov. Tony Evers' budget vetoes.</p>
      <p>Thursday's votes will mark the first time since 2010 that the Legislature has tried to override the veto of a governor. No veto override has succeeded since 1985.</p>
      <p>One of the targeted vetoes killed $15 million in funding to create a northern Wisconsin regional mental health crisis center. Another one blocked $5 million a year for doctors who care for people in state health care programs. The third gave the Evers administration more flexibility in how to spend $500,000 to increase the number of health care providers.</p>
      <p>Republicans will need Democratic votes to be successful in the override, but no Democrats are expected to vote for it. The Senate would also have to go along.</p>
