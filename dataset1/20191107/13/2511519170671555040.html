      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/StokeCity">Stoke City</a> have made an official approach to the Irish Football Association to appoint <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/michael-oneill">Michael O’Neill</a> as their new manager.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/northern-ireland-football">Northern Ireland</a> boss has been in charge at international level for eight years, taking his side to Euro 2016 and being in with a chance of reaching <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a>, too.</p>
      <p>Stoke dismissed Nathan Jones at the start of November and sit bottom of the Championship, with just two wins and eight points from their 15 games this season.</p>
      <p>O’Neill has yet to manage in the English football league, with his previous club roles coming at Brechin in Scotland and Shamrock Rovers in Ireland. As a player, he featured for the likes of Newcastle, Coventry and Wigan in England.</p>
      <p>The IFA have confirmed that Stoke have requested permission to speak to O’Neill and it is understood that discussions are underway regarding compensation amounts.</p>
      <p>Stoke have already been denied the chance to appoint Alex Neil by current club Preston, with an approach rejected soon after Jones’ departure.</p>
      <p>The Potters were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2017/18 season and finished 16th in the second tier last term.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland face Netherlands and Germany in two Euro 2020 qualifiers across the upcoming international break, for which O’Neill has already named his squad.</p>
      <p>Stoke play Barnsley in the Championship on Saturday, before the two-week break.</p>
