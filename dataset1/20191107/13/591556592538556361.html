      <p>Tesla will reveal its highly anticipated but so far unseen electric pickup truck on November 21, Elon Musk announced on Twitter on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Musk called the electric pickup truck the 'Cybertruck' and says Tesla intends to unveil it in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory.   </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-electric-pickup-truck-cybertruck-reveal/">As ZDNet sister site CNET's Roadshow notes</a>, it's not known yet whether the Cybertruck will be a production vehicle or a concept car. But the unveiling should satisfy Tesla fans who have been intrigued by the prospect of an electric pickup ever <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-hopes-to-unveil-semi-truck-this-year-pickup-by-2019/">since April 2017, when Musk teased the idea</a> and said it would be revealed in the next 18 to 24 months. <br/><br/>Musk in <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1072488765753618437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1072488765753618437&amp;ref_url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/elon-musks-plans-for-2019-might-include-a-tesla-pickup-truck-prototype/">December last year said</a> he was keen to make the electric pickup truck and that, "We might have a prototype to unveil next year". <br/><br/>In June 2018, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1011724688706318337">he said the pickup truck</a> "will have power outlets allowing use of heavy-duty 240V, high-power tools in field all day. No generator needed".</p>
      <p>And Musk was keen on the idea of including a utility port from its air suspension system – <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-air-suspension-update-over-the-air/">found on the Model S and X</a> – so that pickup drivers could connect and use air tools.  <br/><br/>The November 21 unveiling will happen during the LA Auto Show, where Tesla will be offering fans a chance to test-drive its electric vehicles. Musk also noted it is the same month in the opening credits for Blade Runner. </p>
      <p>CNET Roadster reckons it's highly unlikely the Cybertruck will go into production soon, in part because Tesla is still trying to make the Model 3 a mass-produced electric car and has the Model Y crossover SUV scheduled for next year. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-to-be-unveiled-nov-21-in-la-elon-musk-says.html">As per CNBC</a>, Musk last year claimed the Tesla electric pickup will be better than the classic Ford F-150 as a truck and a better sports car than a standard Porsche 911.</p>
