      <p>BOCA RATON, Fla. â€” Just like Lyft and Uber, there is a new ride-sharing service aimed at children.</p>
      <p>The service is called 'Zum,' and its focus is children ages five and up.</p>
      <p>While the service is not set up in southwest Florida, it is being tested out in Boca Raton.</p>
      <p>the company says their goal is to provide personalized, door-to-door ride-sharing service for kids.</p>
      <p>For parents, this may sound sketchy and possibly dangerous.</p>
      <p>one driver says the company doesn't play around when it comes to safety; drivers go through several background checks.</p>
