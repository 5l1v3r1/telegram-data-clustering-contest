      <h1>Italy introduces mandatory climate change lessons in schools</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:09:02+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>Italy is to become the first country to make climate change lessons compulsory in schools, Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti announced.</p>
      <p>When children return to class in September 2020 after their summer holidays, their annual curriculum will also include 33 hours — approximately one per school week — dedicated to climate change and sustainable development.</p>
      <p>"I want to make the Italian education system the first education system that puts the environment and society at the core of everything we learn in school," Fioramonti explained to Reuters.</p>
      <p>"The entire ministry is being changed to make sustainability and climate the centre of the education model," he added.</p>
      <p>Fioramonti, 42, is a former professor of political economy at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, and the author of two books he which he argues that Gross Domestic Product — the principal instrument used to measure the economic health of a country — is not representative of how healthy economies are and actually present a distorted picture.</p>
      <p>He was elected to Italy's parliament in March 2018 for the populist Five-Star Movement and was promoted minister in September after his party entered into a coalition with the centre-left Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>He has called for new taxes on plane tickets and on profits from oil drilling to boost funds for educational and environmental policies.</p>
      <p>In September, he also encouraged students to skip school and take part in the Fridays for Future protests which call on world leaders to take more decisive action to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>He described the movement — launched a year earlier by Swedish teen Greta Thunberg — as "essential", adding that students' future was being "threatened by environmental devastation and an unsustainable economic growth model."</p>
