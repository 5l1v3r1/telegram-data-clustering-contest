      <h2>Lowe: 'There would be nothing better for this football club than to have a good run in the FA Cup'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:51:12+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Lowe has some special FA Cup memories from his career as a player, now he wants to create more of them as Plymouth Argyle manager.</p>
      <p>He will get the chance to do so when <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims take on Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup first round</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Bolton are four-times winners of the FA Cup, including in 1923 when they beat West Ham United 2-0 in the first-ever final held at Wembley.</p>
      <p>They have fallen on hard times over recent years and almost went out of business this summer.</p>
      <p>Now, though, after they were rescued out of administration at the end of August, they are aiming to climb the EFL ladder again.</p>
      <p>They are doing so under the management of former Argyle defender Keith Hill and his No 2 David Flitcroft, who used to be his boss at Bury.</p>
      <p>Bolton began the season with a 12-point deduction but after a difficult start they seem to have turned a corner after winning their last three games in League One.</p>
      <p>So a victory for Argyle in the FA Cup tie at the University of Bolton Stadium would be an excellent achievement for them.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “As a player I just wanted to be on Match of the Day – I loved the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>“It’s special. It’s the best cup competition in the world for me, in terms of all the football league clubs, and it’s a great opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Lowe’s FA Cup highlights include playing for Shrewsbury Town against Everton in 2003.</p>
      <p>Shrewsbury beat their Premier League visitors, who included Wayne Rooney in their side, 2-1 in a third round tie.</p>
      <p>Nearly three years later, Lowe netted twice as Chester City, then a League Two club, beat former European champions Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the second round.</p>
      <p>“Gary Megson nearly signed me a few years later and gave me a bit of a telling off for that because he actually got sacked (by Forest) after that,” said Lowe.</p>
      <p>He added: “I have got some special FA Cup memories and we will certainly be looking to get a special memory come Saturday.”</p>
      <p>Argyle would pick up £36,000 in prize money if they were to beat Bolton, with the prospect with even more lucrative rewards further into the competition.</p>
      <p>“The league is our bread and butter, don’t get me wrong, but there would be nothing better for this football club than to have a good run in the FA Cup.”</p>
      <p>Hill, who had a lot of success in two spells as manager of Rochdale, was appointed as Bolton boss soon after the takeover of the club by Football Ventures was completed.</p>
      <p>Flitcroft has had recent spells as manager of Swindon Town and Mansfield Town, who he took to the League Two play-off semi-finals last season.</p>
      <p>He has now been reunited with Hill, having previously worked for him as his assistant at Rochdale.</p>

      <p>Lowe said: “Keith and Flicker are going to go and do a fantastic job, I certainly believe that.</p>
      <p>“They are on a good run of form at the moment. We are probably going there as slight underdogs, if you like, because we are in League Two and they are in League One.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “We are not taking nothing for granted. We are going there bubbly and in good shape ourselves.</p>
      <p>“It’s one loss in seven so we are in good form also and we are looking forward to it. I don’t want to go there and get beat, let me tell you that.</p>
      <p>“I’m going there to win, but ultimately we have got a team standing in our way and Bolton are going to be in the same position as us.”</p>
