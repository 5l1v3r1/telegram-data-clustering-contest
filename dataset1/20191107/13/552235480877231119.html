      <h2>The Rugby Park boss guided his side to nine points from their available 12 in October.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lochlin Highet, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lochlin-highet/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio</a> has scooped the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Ladbrokes Premiership</a> manager of the month award for October.</p>
      <p>The Italian guided the Ayrshire side to three wins in a row in October before his 10 men narrowly lost at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> in the last game of the month.</p>
      <p>The month started brightly with a 1-0 win at Tynecastle as a Chris Burke header, which could also have been argued as an own goal, put <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> to the sword.</p>

      <p>Next up was a 2-1 victory at Rugby Park over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> as goals from Gary Dicker and Rory McKenzie were enough to combat a late Lee Miller strike.</p>
      <p>Then a week later captain Dicker scored again as he helped the side to a 1-0 victory at home to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren.</a></p>
      <p>Killie lost Alex Bruce after just 12 minutes at Fir Park as they went down 2-1 to Motherwell.</p>
      <p>A Dom Thomas equaliser after a Liam Donnelly opener wasn't enough to take anything back home as Devante Cole's header sealed all three points for the Steelmen.</p>
