【三國英雄】之五：曹操袁紹為何分道揚鑣

07 Nov 2019, 13:23

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】董卓進京之後對百姓燒殺搶掠，破壞了中國的民生；壞五銖錢鑄小錢，摧毀了中國的經濟；廢立皇帝，破壞了中國的政治制度，可以說是人神共憤。天下的英雄成立了反董聯盟，共推袁紹做盟主。



可是面對國賊董卓，反董聯軍卻沒一個進攻董卓的。反董聯軍為什麽不反董？面對國難，曹操的選擇又是什麽？
而作為曹操的好朋友，反董聯軍的盟主袁紹在這個時期不打董卓，卻打起了自己盟友的主意。
四世三公的袁紹在這個時間點上做出了和曹操截然不同的選擇，也奠定了曹操和袁紹從此分道揚鑣。
袁紹到底做了什麽呢？請看視頻。

[Four Heroes of the Three Kingdoms]: Why did Cao Cao Yuan Shao parting ways?

07 Nov 2019, 13:23

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] After Dong Zhuo entered Beijing, he burned and looted the people and destroyed the people's livelihood in China. The bad five money cast small money and destroyed the Chinese economy; the emperor was abolished and the Chinese politics was destroyed. The system can be said to be a common indignation. The heroes of the world established the anti-Dong alliance and pushed Yuan Shao as the ally.



However, in the face of the national thief Dong Zhuo, the anti-Donglian army did not attack Dong Zhuo. Why is the anti-Donglian army not opposing Dong? In the face of national difficulties, what is Cao Cao’s choice?
As a good friend of Cao Cao, Yuan Shao, the ally of the anti-Donglian army, did not play Dong Zhuo during this period, but he played the idea of his own allies.
At this point in time, Yuan Shao of the four worlds made a completely different choice from Cao Cao, and also laid a way for Cao Cao and Yuan Shao to separate.
What did Yuan Shao do? Please watch the video.
