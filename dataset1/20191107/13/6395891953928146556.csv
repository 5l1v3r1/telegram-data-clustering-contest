Lava tubes are channels formed by nature where lava flows beneath the surface.
While the tubes snake under the Hawaiian islands, it is rare that someone falls into them, The Washington Post reported.
Police believe the man, who was in his 70s, was trimming branches when he sank through the soft ground over the tubes. Officials said there could have been a hole that the man couldn't see due to overgrowth, the Post reported.
Rescue teams recovered his body by rappelling into the lava tube, CNN reported.
The man died from injuries consistent with falling, police said.
