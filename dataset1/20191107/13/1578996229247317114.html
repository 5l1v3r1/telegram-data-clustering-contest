      <p>Their union comes shortly after <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29651193/kate-middleton-prince-harry-william-feud-stance/">Us Weekly </a></i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29651193/kate-middleton-prince-harry-william-feud-stance/">reported</a> that while Kate was concerned about William and Prince Harry's rift and Meghan's struggle with the British tabloids, she was trying not to get involved. A source told the outlet that Kate "hates to see" Meghan and Harry "so miserable," but “while Kate’s concerned about Harry and Meghan’s well-being, she tries to stay out of the drama.”</p>
      <p>Several upcoming events for Kate and her husband Prince William were announced by Kensington Palace this week. The two are set to attend the Royal Variety Performance at the Palladium Theatre on Monday, November 18, which will benefit the Royal Variety Charity.</p>
      <p>Ahead of that, Kate will do a solo event and visit East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices’ new hospice The Nook on Friday, November 15. The Duchess will meet children and families being supported by EACH, tour the hospice, and officially open the building, per <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1190229371270975490">Kensington Palace</a>.</p>
