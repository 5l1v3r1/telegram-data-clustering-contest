      <p>LONDON: Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp has hailed Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola as the best manager in the world as the Premier League rivals gear up for Sunday's top-of-the-table clash at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Leaders Liverpool have a six-point advantage over the defending champions and the match is a crucial one for both sides.</p>

      <p>The build-up has been coloured by Guardiola saying Liverpool's Sadio Mane sometimes dived and then backtracking.</p>
      <p>Klopp, who has taken a dig at City's "tactical fouling", drew a line under the verbal sparring on Thursday in an interview with Sky Sports television.</p>
      <p>"We constantly get asked questions and sometimes we say what is in that second in our mind without thinking about anything else, that we are in public, that there is a camera," said the German.</p>
      <p>"I couldn’t have more respect for Pep Guardiola, that’s how it is. I’ve known him for so long, for me still it’s a big thing to be his contender.</p>
      <p>"For me he's the best manager in the world and we have the chance to win against his team which is very difficult but possible. That's enough for me."</p>
      <p>Klopp dismissed a suggestion that the match was as much one Liverpool could not afford to lose as must win.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's a 100per cent want-to-win game - 100per cent with all I have," he said. "We want to win and we try everything to make that happen, which is difficult enough. And then after that we will see how the situation is and use that situation.</p>
      <p>"But it's a big one, we know that. The whole world will be watching that game, I would 100per cent, everybody I know will, so it's a massive one."</p>
      <p>Champions League winners Liverpool lost at Manchester City last season after a goalless draw at Anfield and were beaten to the title by a single point.</p>
      <p>"Last year's performance of City at Liverpool was probably the biggest show of respect I ever got, that one of my teams ever got, because they played different to what they usually do," said Klopp.</p>
      <p>"I expect a tight game. How exactly it will be, I don't know."</p>
