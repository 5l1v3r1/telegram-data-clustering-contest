【看懂韓粉番外篇】每個韓粉生命中都有一個韓國瑜（下）
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 鄭進耀
76歲的廖善妹跟女兒同住，客廳的桌上插著中華民國國旗和中國五星旗，牆上是她過世的先生和一家人的合照。廖善妹有4個小孩，假日時會到高雄照顧孫子。她每天固定到菜市場做資源回收，空閒時就到韓國瑜的場子助陣，「我以前每次跟先生回山東，我一定會送那邊的親戚蔣經國的照片和中華民國國旗。」當地的親戚也回贈她五星旗，她不覺得有任何衝突矛盾處，就直接放在客廳插在一起。
她說：「什麼九二共識、一國兩制我不知道，是中國人還是台灣人這個問題我覺得也不重要。」但她討厭民進黨，有時在早餐店、麵店吃東西時，看到報章有蔡英文的照片，她會拿筆將蔡英文的臉塗黑，身上沒筆的話，就用手指把報紙上的頭像戳洞。這個報章「斬首」名單不只蔡英文，還包括陳水扁、李登輝等人，讀報這件事對廖善妹來說，是一件眼到心到，手也要到的三到運動。
問她為什麼支持韓國瑜？她先是說：「不然要支持蔡英文嗎？只要國民黨推出來的都會支持。」郭台銘也是國民黨的你怎不支持他？「他不行。韓國瑜比較像蔣經國。」說到底，影響她的投票意向不是韓國瑜的什麼特質，而是哪個候選人最像蔣經國。
廖善妹有一照珍藏的照片不輕易示人，那是她大約三十多歲那年，到溪頭出遊。當時還叫「廖美惠」的她走累了，坐在路邊，見到遠方一名中年男子，週邊簇湧著人群。中年男子走到她面前，親切問她早餐吃了嗎？吃了些什麼？廖善妹發現，那是當時的行政院長蔣經國。
蔣經國親切搭著她的肩拍照，成了廖善妹一說再說的往事：「從來沒有一個男人這樣對我說話，而且還是官位這麼大的人。」
回首前半生，沒有一個男人這樣和顏悅色跟廖善妹說過話，她出生於屏東內埔豐田的客家村。家中務農，經濟困窘，小學畢業就被父親賣到隔壁村當養女，她耐不住想家，總是想盡辦法逃回家，最後都由父親賠錢了事。最後，父親乾脆將她賣到台北，想逃也無處可逃了。
即便已經隔了一世紀這麼久了，廖善妹還能背得出台北養父家的住址，記得養父養母的名字，但這一切並不是基於感恩：「我每天負責全家的打掃工作，養母不高興就打我出氣…我偷偷拿家裡的廢紙箱去賣，把賺來的錢偷偷寄回去，叫爸爸來贖我回屏東。」父親一直沒來接她，最後她以死相逼，才終於回鄉。
回鄉後，父親仍沒給她好臉色，逼17歲的她嫁給一位大她35歲，山東來的高先生。高先生待人和氣，在台電公司任工程師，但回到家又變成一個人，專打老婆出氣：「我懷孕7個月，不小心打破碗，我嚇到發抖，管不了手被劃破，流血了，騎單車一直騎，騎到市區買一個一模一樣的碗回來，就怕我先生回來，又要打人了。」
鄰居都說，高太太個子小小的，看不出來這麼會跑，高先生人高馬大發脾氣要打人時，怎麼都追不上他太太。不過，總有跑累的時候，只能躲在椅子底下，人高馬大的高先生一把將她拖出痛打一頓。鄰居也說，高太太被打成這樣，她先生死了，一定不會哭。廖善妹不曉得，對很多像高先生這樣在戰爭裡倖存，而後被迫離鄉、有家歸不得的外省人，內心的創傷最後只能以暴力傷害親近的人。高先生和高太太都是被這個時代所傷的人。
「我名字有個善字啊，我這人就是壞在善良。」高先生愈來愈老，廖善妹依舊認命服侍他，每天精心準備高先生愛吃的饅頭，只是年歲已大，從一餐二顆，變成一餐一顆，漸漸地連半顆都吃不完了。在過世前一年，高先生很認真跟廖善妹道歉，她還記得：「他跟我說，打妳一輩子了，妳都不跑，妳待我也是一片真心，我不應該這樣對妳。」
浪子回頭金不換，即使被打了大半輩子，廖善妹一念之間就原諒了先生：「這種會悔改的人，你不覺得很感人嗎？」她也用一樣的話，形容韓國瑜年輕時吃喝嫖賭，而後當上高雄市長的人生經歷。
高先生在世時，偶而看著電視新聞罵台獨、罵民進黨，但少有實際參與政治運動的時候，廖善妹不同，她是高屏地區有名的「衝組」，敢跟民進黨支持者在街頭打架，還上了報，每逢選舉，帶頭一號召就能招滿數台遊覽車參加造勢。


舊剪報裡，廖善妹（未改名前為廖美惠）捧著與蔣經國的合照到頭寮追拜蔣經國。

「我是結婚之後，才有政治立場，很多政治的事都是我先生跟我說的…。」廖善妹攤開了幾張舊剪報，那是她拿著當年與蔣經國的合照哭倒在頭寮的新聞照片，她有些得意，每年蔣經國逝世當天，她必到頭寮一哭：「我哭到那些衛兵都認識我了，會讓我靠近棺木的地方哭，一般人是不能靠得這麼近。」一個打她的男人，教了她什麼是政治；一個對她溫柔摟肩合照的政治強人，則成了她政治信仰的核心。而這二種男人形象，在廖善妹心理，在韓國瑜身上得到完美的投射：一個會悔改的政治人物，又時時刻刻把蔣經國做為典範掛在嘴邊。
前立法委員林濁水形容韓國瑜是一個「羅賓漢」人物，行俠仗義，無視法律：「這種形象的政治人物很得到社會底層的共鳴，無視法律同時也是這些底層人們共同的生活經驗，他們甚至認為，違法又沒事的人是真正有辦法的人。」不只一位韓粉告訴我們：「韓國瑜說貪污的話要把自己關到死，你聽了能不感動嗎?」但同時拿農舍事件追問韓粉，得到的反應大多是：「他是被冤枉的…。」「這種小事，有什麼大不了的？」
「一個對的政治人物，比制度還重要。」一位韓粉這樣說，這也普遍存在所有韓粉的心裡。只有人是重要，制度一點也不重要。一個會承諾假使貪污願意把自己關到死的政治人物本身就道德的化身，羅賓漢就是道德，不必在乎法律。
代表打破既有傳統框架的「羅賓漢」所追尋的，卻是矛盾地回到威權秩序的時代。高雄長庚醫院神科醫師李俊毅分析：「多數經歷那段時光的人，甚至經歷過白色恐怖時期，這些人的政治傾向多數是偏向保守的，也就是不講話、不反抗是他們維繫生命與工作的主要方式，這是一種對攻擊者認同（identification with the aggressor）的心理防衛機轉，保命用的。」他認為台灣一直有認同的危機：「認同讓一個該離開、該失去的客體不用離開，而是內化到個案的內在世界，彷彿這個逝去的客體依然真實存在。」
廖善妹似乎沒有好好哀悼自己身上發生的一切創傷， 原該離開的威權沒有離開，反而曲曲折折內化成手上珍藏的那張合照，當她抱著合照而哭時，生命中那些創傷好像都變得輕飄飄的，不重要了。

[See Korean powder outside the article] Every Korean powder has a Korean Yu (below)
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Zheng Jinyao
The 76-year-old Liao Shanmei lives with her daughter. The table on the living room is lined with the flag of the Republic of China and the Chinese five-star flag. The wall is a photo of her dead husband and family. Liao Shanmei has 4 children and will go to Kaohsiung to take care of her grandson during the holiday. She fixed to the vegetable market every day to do resource recovery. When she was free, she went to the South Korean Yu field to help out. ""I used to go back to Shandong with my husband every time. I will send photos of relatives Jiang Jingguo and the Republic of China flag."" Relatives also donated her five-star flag. She did not feel that there were any conflicts and conflicts, and they were directly placed in the living room.
She said: ""I don't know what the 1992 consensus, the one country, two systems, the Chinese or the Taiwanese. I don't think it matters."" But she hates the DPP, sometimes when she eats at breakfast and noodle shops. The newspaper has a picture of Tsai Ing-wen. She will blacken the face of Tsai Ing-wen with a pen. If there is no pen on her body, she will use her fingers to poke the picture on the newspaper. The list of ""daggers"" in this newspaper is not only Tsai Ing-wen, but also Chen Shui-bian, Lee Teng-hui and others. Reading this newspaper for Liao Shanmei is an eye-catching, three-to-sport movement.
Ask her why she supports Korean Yu? She said first: ""Do you want to support Tsai Ing-wen? As long as the Kuomintang is launched, it will support it."" Why is Guo Taiming also a KMT? ""He can't. Korean Yu is more like Chiang Ching-kuo."" In the end, the voting intention that affects her is not what traits of Korean Yu, but which candidate is most like Chiang Ching-kuo.
Liao Shanmei’s photo with a collection of photos is not easy to show, that is, when she was about thirty years old, she went to Xitou for a trip. At that time, she was also called ""Liao Meihui"". She was tired and sat on the side of the road. She saw a middle-aged man in the distance and surrounded the crowd. The middle-aged man walked up to her and asked her if she had breakfast. What have you eaten? Liao Shanmei discovered that it was the then Executive Director Jiang Jingguo.
Jiang Jingguo cordially took pictures of her shoulders and became the past that Liao Shanmei said: ""No man has ever spoken to me like this, and he is still a man of such a large official position.""
Looking back on the first half of my life, no man like Yu Yanyue and Liao Shanmei had spoken. She was born in Hakka Village, Toyota, Pingtung. I am farming in the family, and the economy is embarrassed. When I graduated from elementary school, my father sold to the next village to be a foster daughter. She couldn’t resist homesickness and always tried to escape home. In the end, her father lost money. In the end, my father simply sold her to Taipei, and there was nowhere to escape.
Even after so many years have passed, Liao Shanmei can still bear the address of the father's family in Taipei, remember the name of the adoptive father, but this is not based on gratitude: ""I am responsible for the cleaning of the whole family every day, and the mother is not happy. I vented... I secretly took the waste cartons from my house and sold them, and sneaked back the money I earned, and asked my father to redeem me back to Pingtung.” My father never came to pick her up, and finally she forced her to return to her hometown. .
After returning home, her father still did not give her a good face, forcing her to marry a 35-year-old, she is 35 years old, Mr. Gao from Shandong. Mr. Gao is a man of enthusiasm. He worked as an engineer at Taipower Company, but he became a person when he returned home. He specializes in his wife's anger: ""I was pregnant for 7 months. I accidentally broke the bowl. I was scared to tremble. I couldn’t control my hand and was bleeding. I have been riding a bicycle all the time, riding in the city to buy a bowl of the same kind, I am afraid that my husband will come back and hit someone again.""
Neighbors said that Gao Tai is too small to see that he will run. When Mr. Gao is so angry that he wants to beat someone, he can't catch up with his wife. However, when there is always running tired, he can only hide under the chair, and Mr. Gao, who is a tall man, drags her out and beats him. Neighbors also said that Gao Taitai was beaten like this, her husband is dead, and she will not cry. Liao Shanmei did not know that many of the other provinces like Mr. Gao who survived the war and then were forced to leave their homes and have their families to return home, the inner wounds can only hurt people close to them with violence. Mr. Gao and Mrs. Gao are both injured by this era.
""My name has a good word. I am a bad person."" Mr. Gao is getting older. Liao Shanmei still promises to serve him. Every day, he carefully prepares the gimmicks that Mr. Gao loves. He is only a year old, from a meal. Two, become one meal, and gradually can not finish even half a piece. One year before his death, Mr. Gao apologized very seriously to Liao Shanmei. She still remembers: ""He told me that he had been fighting for a lifetime, and he did not run. It is true that I am treated as a sincerity. I should not be so confronted.""
The prodigal son does not change the gold. Even if he has been beaten for most of his life, Liao Shanmei forgave the gentleman for a moment: ""Do you feel resentful, do you not feel very touching?"" She also used the same words to describe Korean yogi eating and drinking. Then became the life experience of Kaohsiung Mayor.
When Mr. Gao was alive, he occasionally watched TV news, Taiwan independence, and the Democratic Progressive Party. However, when there was little actual participation in the political movement, Liao Shanmei was different. She was a famous ""rushing group"" in Gaoping District, dare to support DPP supporters. Fighting in the streets, and still reported, every election, take the lead in the call to recruit a number of tour buses to participate in the momentum.


In the old newspaper clippings, Liao Shanmei (not renamed Liao Meihui) held a photo with Chiang Ching-kuo to go to the head to chase Chiang Ching-kuo.

""I have a political position after I got married. Many political things are what my husband told me..."" Liao Shanmei spread a few old newspaper clippings, which she took with the photo of Chiang Ching-kuo and cried in the head. The news photos, she is somewhat proud, every year on the day of Chiang Ching-kuo’s death, she will cry at the head: ""I cried that the guards knew me, and would make me cry near the coffin. The average person can't be so close."" A man who beat her, taught her what politics is; a political strongman who is gentle and shoulder-to-shoulder, has become the core of her political beliefs. The images of these two men, in Liao Shanmei's psychology, have been perfectly projected in South Korea's Yu: a politician who will repent, and always hangs Jiang Jingguo as a model.
Former legislator Lin Zhuoshui described South Korea as a ""Robin Hood"" character, arrogant and disregarding the law: ""The politicians of this image are very resonated by the bottom of society, ignoring the law and the common life experience of these bottom people, they even think Those who violate the law and have nothing to do are people who really have a way."" More than one Han powder told us: ""If you say that corruption is in Korea, you have to shut yourself down. Can you listen to it?"" But at the same time, I asked the farmhouse incident. Han Han, the response is mostly: ""He is being shackled..."" ""This little thing, what's the big deal?""
""A politician of the right is more important than the system."" A Korean powder said that this is also common in all Korean powder. Only people are important, and the system is not important at all. A politician who promises to be willing to shut himself down to death is a manifestation of morality. Robin Hood is moral and does not have to care about the law.
The “Robin Hood”, which represents the breaking of the traditional framework, is the era of contradictory return to authoritarian order. Li Junyi, a psychiatrist at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital, said: ""Most of the people who have experienced that period of time have even experienced white horror. Most of these people's political tendencies are conservative, that is, they do not talk or resist. It is their maintenance of life and work. The main way, this is a kind of mental defense machine for identification with the aggressor, which is used for life.” He believes that Taiwan has always had a crisis of identity: “Identify that one should leave, the lost object does not have to leave, It is internalized into the inner world of the case, as if the lost object still exists.""
Liao Shanmei did not seem to mourn all the wounds that occurred in her body. The authoritarians who had left should not leave. Instead, they turned into a group of photos in their hands. When she cried with a photo, the wounds in life seemed to change. It’s not important to be light and fluttering.
