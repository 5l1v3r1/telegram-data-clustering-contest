      <p><b>SAN ANTONIO</b> -</p>
      <p>A woman was <a href="https://twitter.com/Espinosa35__/status/1191898816791879680">caught on video</a> throwing trays with an employee during a fight Tuesday at a San Antonio Popeyes restaurant.</p>

      <p>The young woman can be seen in the video standing in line before the melee starts. </p>
      <p>An employee is defensively holding up a tray while she and the woman yell at each other. The employee then picks the tray up over her head and throws it at the customer. </p>
      <p>A man in a military veteran hat holds back the customer's arms behind her back as the manager comes around the counter.</p>
      <p>The woman and manager went outside and fought in the parking lot, <a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/2019/11/07/trays-fly-in-viral-video-at-san-antonio-popeyes-as-employee-fights-with-customer/">KSAT reported</a>. That altercation was not caught on video.</p>
      <p>San Antonio police did not have any calls for service at the Popeyes, <a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/2019/11/07/trays-fly-in-viral-video-at-san-antonio-popeyes-as-employee-fights-with-customer/">KSAT reported</a>. </p>
      <p>The restaurant did not <a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/2019/11/07/trays-fly-in-viral-video-at-san-antonio-popeyes-as-employee-fights-with-customer/">comment to KSAT</a>. </p>
      <p>The video comes just days after a man was <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/trending-now/man-found-fatally-stabbed-outside-maryland-popeyes/1005138529">fatally stabbed for cutting</a> in line at a Maryland Popeyes. </p>
