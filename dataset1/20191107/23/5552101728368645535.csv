【看懂韓粉5】盼不到「明天會更好」　專家揭高雄由綠翻藍真相

「國民黨很久沒有這樣的政治人物了！」王豪餘認為韓國瑜和傳統國民黨政治人物不同，他從韓國瑜競選國民黨黨主席就成為韓粉。然前立委林濁水語帶諷刺評論：「與其形容他是眷村的小流氓，不如說是羅賓漢，行俠仗義，無視法律。」
在北農時期，將公司賺得的錢分紅給員工，的確是夠俠義了；但也有北農員工認為：「台北果菜市場要改建、現場通風不好、設施老舊，錢有更多該花的地方，而不是分一分就算了，如果公司是你自己的，你辛苦賺的錢絕對不會這樣隨便分掉。」
韓國瑜的行為，源於他很清楚自己的位子充滿政治性。韓國瑜不只花大錢當「俠客」收買人心，也勤走雲嘉地區，表面上是為了農產，但一位北農人告訴我們：「北農總經理常要跟產地農民溝通，到拍賣市場巡視，但韓總只會到雲嘉，不常到產地和市場巡視，而是到政治組織走動。」
在中央與地方矛盾中保住自己的北農位子、氣候異常使得公司異常獲利；加上出身基層選舉，言語犀利、精於選舉運作，符合這個時代對「羅賓漢」型政治人物的渴望。韓國瑜的興起有其機運，但說到底，是戰後經濟高速發展期遺留下這時代專屬的獨特問題，才培養出孕育鋼鐵韓粉的沃土。


所有的韓粉對過往的經濟奇蹟、亞洲四小龍的神話津津樂道。

中研院副研究員瞿宛文的研究指出，台灣戰後經濟發展，背後是從土地改革一路的經濟作為。一面仰賴政府干預市場，調整出適合經濟後進國發展的環境，如對財政、物價問題的高度戒慎恐懼。時至90年代中期，這個世代的「明天會更好」的想像遇到挫敗。台灣加入WTO，中國經濟開始起飛，反倒吸納台灣的經濟能量。
72歲的陳先生，年輕時在外資投資的工廠裡擔任幹部，習得技術之後，80年代開設自己的工廠。幾年之間，累績了財富，到了90年代開始，產業卻開始外移，並伴隨國族認同、經濟競爭，對岸中國成了一個複雜情結的外在他者。
這樣的複雜情結，在高雄這座長期由民進黨執政的城市，特為明顯。長庚醫院精神科醫師李俊毅以高雄韓國瑜的勝選為例，分析其背景：「高雄已經沒落長達20年，這是一個很難啟齒的問題，高雄曾是充滿光榮感的城市，但傳產出走、高科技進不來，只留下中油等高污染產業，這也是台灣產業的類似困境。」


想回到過去的韓粉，因為現實的困境，只能築起更高的錯覺高牆來回避現況。

林濁水指出，90年代中南部原本是是國民黨票倉，隨著中小企業外移，中南部的選民開始將經濟失落感投射到民進黨上。10年間，中南部轉而成為民進黨票倉。但這樣的版圖，在近幾年又再一次變動——許多中南部原是綠營支持者，在2018年大選卻倒戈成了韓粉，好比賣魚的文山伯、菜農林佳新等人。1位農業專家分析：「自加入WTO以來，為了開放農產品，民進黨政府一直延續國民黨時期的補助政策，農業沒有產業觀，只有砸錢補助的福利化傾向。」
水稻靠公糧收購，鳳梨、高麗菜價崩靠政府補貼，該專家表示：「台灣是全球前十大農產進口國，你以為農產專做內銷就好，現在連內銷市場也得跟國外農產品競爭，農業狀況也愈來愈不樂觀。」民進黨無法解決農村缺工，又缺乏產業政策，遇上吳音寧與韓國瑜在北農總經理位置上的媒體效應落差，一舉點燃不滿，政治變天。
韓國瑜挾「賣菜郎」的形象襲捲中南部農業縣，高雄市長上任初期勤於出國簽屬各項農產品銷售合約，原本造成中南部經濟困境因素之一的中國，搖身一變成了農業困境的解答，甚至還被期待是所有產業的解答，總錯誤期待：「只要東西賣到中國市場就能賺大錢」。

[See Korean powder 5] I don't expect ""Tomorrow will be better"" Experts reveal Gao Chunxiong's truth from green to blue
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Yang Zilei, Chen Yiwei, Photography Group
""The Kuomintang has not had such a political figure for a long time!"" Wang Haoyu thinks that the Korean Yu and the traditional Kuomintang politicians are different. He has become the Korean powder since he was elected to the KMT Party. However, the former legislator Lin Shuoshui said with irony: ""It is better to say that he is a hooligan in the village, but rather Robin Hood, who is arrogant and disregards the law.""
In the period of the Northern Farming Period, it was indeed chivalrous to distribute the money earned by the company to the employees. However, there are also employees of the North Farmers who believe that: ""The Taipei fruit and vegetable market should be rebuilt, the site is not well ventilated, the facilities are old, and the money has more places for the flowers. It’s not a point, if the company is your own, your hard-earned money will never be so casual.""
The behavior of Korean Yu is due to his clarity that his position is political. South Korea Yu not only spends a lot of money as a ""Knight"" to buy people's hearts, but also diligently walks to the Yunjia area, on the surface for agricultural production, but a North farmer tells us: ""The general manager of Beinong often communicates with the farmers in the production area and visits the auction market. However, Han will only go to Yunjia, not to visit the place of origin and the market, but to move to political organizations.""
In the central and local contradictions, maintaining their own north agricultural position and climate anomalies made the company extremely profitable; coupled with the elections at the grassroots level, the words were sharp and refined, and they were in line with the eagerness of the ""Robin Hood"" politicians in this era. The rise of South Korea's Yu has its own machine, but in the final analysis, it is the unique problem that was left behind in this era after the post-war economic rapid development period, and it has cultivated fertile soil for the production of steel and Korean powder.


All the Korean powder is relished by the economic miracles of the past and the myth of the Asian Tigers.

Yan Wanwen, an associate researcher at the Academia Sinica, pointed out that Taiwan’s post-war economic development is backed by economic actions from land reform. On the one hand, relying on the government to intervene in the market, and adjusting the environment suitable for the development of the economy after entering the country, such as the high fear of financial and price issues. By the mid-1990s, the imagination of this generation of ""better tomorrow"" was frustrated. When Taiwan joined the WTO, the Chinese economy began to take off, but it absorbed the economic energy of Taiwan.
Mr. Chen, 72, worked as a cadre in a foreign-invested factory when he was young. After acquiring technology, he opened his own factory in the 1980s. In the past few years, wealth has been accumulated. In the 1990s, the industry began to move outwards, and along with national identity and economic competition, China on the other side became an external one with complex complexities.
This complex complex is particularly evident in Kaohsiung, a city that has long been governed by the DPP. Li Junyi, a psychiatrist at Chang Gung Hospital, took the example of Kaohsiung Korea Yu as an example. He analyzed the background: ""Kaohsiung has been down for 20 years. This is a difficult question. Kaohsiung used to be a city full of glory, but it was a good result. Going away, high-tech can't get in, leaving only the highly polluting industries such as CNPC, which is also a similar dilemma for Taiwan's industry.""


I want to go back to the Korean powder in the past. Because of the reality of the predicament, I can only build a higher illusion and avoid the situation.

Lin Zhuoshui pointed out that the central and southern parts of the 1990s were originally Kuomintang ticket warehouses. As SMEs moved outward, voters in the south-central region began to cast a sense of economic loss on the DPP. In the past 10 years, the central and southern parts have turned into the DPP ticket warehouse. However, such a map has changed again in recent years - many of the central and southern regions were originally supporters of the Green Camp. In the 2018 election, they turned into Korean powder, such as Wenshanbo, vegetable farmer Lin Jiaxin and others who sell fish. An agricultural expert analyzed: ""Since joining the WTO, in order to open up agricultural products, the DPP government has continued the subsidy policy of the Kuomintang period. There is no industrial view in agriculture, and there is only a welfare trend for subsidies.""
Rice is purchased by public grain, and the price of pineapple and Korean food collapses with government subsidies. The expert said: ""Taiwan is the top ten importer of agricultural products in the world. You think that agricultural products are good for domestic sales. Now even the domestic market has to go abroad. The agricultural products are competing, and the agricultural situation is becoming less and less optimistic.” The DPP cannot solve the rural shortage of labor and lacks industrial policies. In the face of the media effect gap between Wu Yinning and South Korea’s general manager of North Agriculture, the dissatisfaction is ignited. Politics is changing.
The image of South Korean yoga ""selling the lang"" hit the agricultural county in the south of China. The Kaohsiung mayor was in diligently signed a contract for the sale of agricultural products at the beginning of the year. China, which originally caused one of the economic difficulties in central and southern China, became an agricultural dilemma. The answer is even expected to be the answer of all industries. The total error is expected: ""As long as things are sold to the Chinese market, you can make big money.""
