【加州北太浩湖（下）】帆船遨遊湖畔　餐廳欣賞夕陽沉落山頭
07 Nov 2019, 23:57 by 童心怡, 童心怡
在太浩市除了能採買食材，小鎮上亦有不少戶外體驗，我自己最喜歡的一項，是搭帆船遊湖。皮膚曬得黝黑的船長Tyler熱情帶領遊客上船，他不但很會介紹，也很會幫遊客拍照，讓這趟旅程風趣又難忘。


船長Tyler風趣幽默，也很會跟客人合照。



在船上可以一邊欣賞風景，吹著微微徐風，即便是仲夏也很涼爽。

搭帆船最大的樂趣是乘風而行，隨著船駛離碼頭，水手會升起帆布，緩緩的航行在湛藍水面上。由於太浩湖幅員遼闊，兩小時航程只夠繞湖的四分之一圈，加上海拔較高，即便是夏天，微風徐來，仍有陣陣涼意；沒一會兒，船員開始詢問每個人想要的飲料，在航程中皆可無限暢飲，我想，遊湖就該如此享受。


喜歡戶外運動的人也可以在湖上划獨木舟。



在湖邊野餐也是另一種享受太浩湖的方式。

傍晚，距離市區5分鐘車程的「Sunnyside Restaurant and Lodge」，是一邊欣賞湖光山色與用餐的好去處，餐廳就緊鄰湖岸，還有專屬的遊艇碼頭。如果不急著填飽肚子，可以先到戶外酒吧或用餐區，點些前菜和飲料，悠閒的欣賞落日餘暉映射在白色峰頂上的橘黃霞光，為我在太浩湖的短暫旅程畫下完美句點。


搭船遊湖能從另一種角度欣賞鷹岩。



傍晚在湖邊的餐廳用餐，很適合做為太浩湖之旅的句點。



天色未暗，可以坐在戶外區，慢慢欣賞落日餘暉。

[California North Lake Tahoe (below)] Sailing boat tour the lakeside restaurant to enjoy the sunset sunken hills
07 Nov 2019, 23:57 by Tong Xinyi, Tong Xinyi
In addition to buying ingredients in Taihao City, there are many outdoor experiences in the town. One of my favorite things is to take a sailing tour of the lake. The skinned captain Tyler enthusiastically led the tourists to the boat. He not only introduced it, but also helped the tourists to take pictures, making this trip fun and memorable.


Captain Tyler is humorous and will be taking photos with the guests.



On the boat, you can enjoy the scenery, blowing a slight breeze, even in the midsummer is very cool.

The biggest pleasure of sailing is to ride the wind. As the ship sails off the dock, the sailor will lift the canvas and slowly sail on the blue water. Due to the vast size of Lake Tahoe, the two-hour voyage is only enough to circle a quarter of the lake, and the altitude is higher. Even in the summer, the breeze is still cool. After a while, the crew began to ask everyone to think. The beverages you want can be enjoyed in the voyage. I think that you should enjoy the lake.


People who enjoy outdoor sports can also go canoeing on the lake.



Picnic at the lake is another way to enjoy Lake Tahoe.

In the evening, the ""Sunnyside Restaurant and Lodge"", a 5-minute drive from the city, is a great place to enjoy the lake and mountains and dining. The restaurant is right next to the lakeshore and has its own yacht marina. If you are not in a hurry to fill your stomach, you can go to the outdoor bar or dining area, order some appetizers and drinks, and enjoy the sunset glow of the orange glow on the white peak, drawing a perfect ending for my short journey on Lake Tahoe. .


Take a boat trip to the lake to enjoy the Eagle Rock from another angle.



Dining in the restaurant by the lake in the evening is a good time for a trip to Lake Tahoe.



The sky is not dark, you can sit in the outdoor area and slowly enjoy the sunset.
