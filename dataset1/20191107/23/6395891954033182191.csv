PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Progressives in Rhode Island have unveiled a plan to power a town with only renewable energy.
The proposal announced Wednesday by the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats of America is the first part of a larger goal to ""fight the climate crisis"" and meet all the state's energy needs with solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage facilities by 2030.
The Providence Journal reports the goal of the blueprint is to find ways to generate an excess of renewable energy that a public utility could sell out of state and the profits would be channeled back to state residents.
The goal is for the city of Cranston to be powered with a combination of sources.
The group has hired a joint venture of consulting firms for $26,000 to develop the plan.
