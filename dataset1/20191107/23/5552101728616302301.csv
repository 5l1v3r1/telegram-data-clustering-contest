【鏡書摘】《江湖無招》選摘九之七

07 Nov 2019, 23:28

清同治年間，太平天國之亂波及甚廣，
山東糧行幼子儲幼寧小小年紀遭逢連番變故而罹上抑鬱之症，
由家中師爺閻桐春將其帶上周邊山寨扶養，卻因禍得福，
演化出察人所不能察，見人所不能見的異稟，
之後更練就絕世武技。十五歲後，儲為了避禍住在鹽商金阿根處。

故事提要


儲幼寧才剛大婚，卻傳來山寨故人遭屠盡的消息。在德州，儲求助金阿根舊識胡延海。二人一見如故，並於次日一同前往秋決現場觀賞砍頭好戲。事後，胡延海帶著儲幼寧拜訪趙一刀。趙一刀對二人詳述成為劊子手的過程。

罷，胡延海又向一旁小攤、小挑子，買了醬爆牛肉、燻魚、滷豆干、五香花生、五十個素煎餃，外帶一整隻德州扒雞。另外，又買了一個德州西瓜。這德州扒雞，聞名遐邇，口味鮮鹹香嫩，肉嫩骨酥，拿筷子夾住，稍微抖抖，即骨脫肉爛，故又名脫骨扒雞。而德州西瓜，在北五省，也是叫得出字號。
各樣菜色，隨即一一端上酒缸木蓋，唯有那西瓜，卻是挑好了之後，先不送來，得裝進木桶裡，扔進井裡，讓井內涼水浸泡。待酒足菜飽之後，再將西瓜自井裡撈上來，切開了吃，涼透脾胃，特別受用。
趙一刀茹素，就吃花生、豆干、素餃等，其他葷菜，就由胡延海、儲幼寧爺兒倆飽餐一頓。
三人邊吃邊聊，胡延海就慫恿趙一刀，講講當初入行學藝之事。趙一刀說，這都是陳年往事，說過多次，胡延海早知，何必再問。胡延海則說，他雖知此事甚詳，但儲幼寧從未聽過，就要趙一刀趁著酒勁，再講講當年。
趙一刀喝了口燒刀子，夾起一筷子滷豆干，放進嘴裡嚼著道：「好吧，小娃娃，就看在這老頭面上，我再講講我這一輩子刀頭舔血的勾當。這話，得從五百年前講起了，那時候，還是前明，明太祖有個兒子，叫朱棣，是為燕王。這人，身邊有五位貼身衛士，五兄弟，姓姜。這姜家五兄弟，專給燕王幹些殺人勾當，替燕王剷除異己。後來，明太祖死了，把皇位傳給孫子。」
「燕王不安分，後來作亂，把侄子皇帝殺了，自己當上了皇帝，這就是明成祖。他當皇帝之後，姜家五兄弟還給他辦事，專門替他砍人頭。這姜家五虎，在刑部掛名當差，職位叫執事。這就是求個好聽，執事，執什麼事？執的還是砍人頭的事。在那之後，就有了規矩，把行刑劊子手都稱為執事。就這樣，一代一代往下傳，京裡刑部執事，都是姜家五虎後代弟子。等年代一久，自然也收外姓人。但可有一樣，五百年之後，這執事還是師徒制，不是你要當執事，就能當執事，那得有人引薦，有師父收你，你先當徒弟，練上不知多少年工夫，等你師父說，你成了，你才能上場出紅差。」
儲幼寧問道：「趙老爺子，什麼叫紅差？」
趙一刀道：「你聽不懂嗎，砍人頭會流血，所以，劊子手上法場砍人頭，就叫出紅差。」
胡延海道：「繼續說，我都聽多少次了，還想再聽，你這故事，百聽不厭。」
趙一刀道：「我是德州本鄉本土人，自小家窮，沒能力讀書，起小自懂事起，就幫著家裡，下地去幹活兒。十六歲那年，因故惹上了麻煩，地痞混混放話，要廢我一隻招子。於是，我趕緊逃離老家，去北京投靠熟人。」
儲幼寧又問道：「趙老爺子，什麼叫招子？」
胡延海代為答道：「江湖話，就是眼睛。」
趙一刀接著道：「到了北京，兩眼漆黑，誰也不認識，要找的熟人，也沒找到，不曉得搬到哪兒去了。沒法子，肚子餓，得找活兒幹。於是，就搖煤球，當了煤黑子。小娃娃，你又要問，什麼是煤黑子，我先說了，就是搖煤球小徒弟，身上被煤染得漆黑，叫煤黑子。搖煤球，苦啊。把碎煤塊與黏黃土攪混了，然後放進笸籮裡搖，搖成一個一個圓煤球。」
「沒法子，大字不識一個，在北京人生地不熟，能幹什麼呢？有天，正搖著煤球，有個勁裝打扮武生模樣漢子路過，見我還有一膀子力氣，就問我，願不願意到刑部當執事？我那年紀，啥都不懂，一聽刑部，心裡就害怕，又聽什麼執事，更是不懂，當時就懵了，呆在那兒，不知該怎麼答？那人就說，管吃管住，吃得飽，有床睡，身上乾淨。我這就聽懂了，當場點頭，就跟了去。」
「這武生模樣漢子，叫姜勇，就是當年姜家五虎後代，當時就是個刑部執事，也就是北京城砍人頭劊子手。他帶我回家，姜家大院，在北京南城，那兒窮人多。北京嘛，說是東富西貴南貧北賤，說是東城富人多，西城貴人多，南城窮人多，北城低賤行業人多。這話，到底是真是假，我在北京多年，總也說不清楚。有些人銅牙鐵齒，硬說就是這樣，另有人說，這純屬胡說八道。不管這話是真是假，光說那姜家大院，位於南城，裡頭住著的，全是姜家後代。」

The two met at the same time, and went to the autumn meeting on the next day to watch the beheading. Afterwards, Hu Yanhai took Zhao Youning to visit Zhao Yidao.

This Texas pheasant is famous for its taste, fresh and salty, tender and tender, with chopsticks and slightly shaken, that is, bones are rotten, so it is also known as boneless chicken. And Texas Watermelon, in the Northern Five Provinces, is also called the font size.
All kinds of dishes, then one end on the wine tank wooden cover, only the watermelon, but after picking it, do not send it, you have to put it into the barrel, throw it into the well, let the well water soak. After the satiated food is full, the watermelon is picked up from the well, cut and eaten, cool and spleen and stomach, especially used.
Zhao Yisuo Rusu, eat peanuts, dried beans, vegetarian dumplings, etc., other amaranth, Hu Yanhai, Chu Youning, two children to eat a meal.
When the three people ate and talked, Hu Yanhai yelled at Zhao and talked about the things he had learned. Zhao Yidao said that this is a past event. He has said many times that Hu Yanhai knew it early, why bother to ask. Hu Yanhai said that although he knew that the matter was very detailed, but Chu Youning had never heard of it, it was necessary for Zhao Yi to sip his energy and talk about the same year.
Zhao Yidao drank his mouth and burned a knife. He picked up a chopstick and dried the dried bean curd. He put it in his mouth and chewed: ""Well, little doll, just look at this old man's face. Let me talk about my life's head and blood."" In this case, it has to be talked about five hundred years ago. At that time, it was still the former Ming, Ming Taizu had a son named Zhu Xi, who was Yan Wang. This person has five personal guards and five brothers. The surname Jiang. This Jiang family five brothers, dedicated to Yan Wang to do some murder activities, for Yan Wang to eradicate dissidents. Later, Ming Taizu died, passed the throne to his grandson.
""Yan Wang is restless, later chaos, killing the emperor, and he became the emperor. This is Ming Chengzu.

The five tigers are famous in the criminal department, and the position is called the deacon. This is to ask for a good, deacon, and what to do? It is still a matter of hacking people. After that, there is a rule that the executioner is called a deacon. In this way, generations and generations of descendants, the deacons of the Jingli Prison Department, are descendants of the Jiang family and the five tigers. After a long time, naturally, they also received surnames. But there is one, five hundred years later, this deacon is still a mentoring system. It is not that you have to be a deacon, you can be a deacon, you have to be recommended, there is a master to accept you, you first become an apprentice, do not know how many years of training, wait for your master to say, you become, you can play the game. ""
Chu Youning asked: ""Zhao Laozi, what is the difference?""
Zhao Yidao said: ""Do you not understand, the hacking head will bleed, so the scorpion slashes the head in the field, and it is called the red.""
Hu Yanhai said: ""Continue to say, I have listened to it many times, and I want to hear it again. You can’t listen to this story.""
Zhao Yidao said: ""I am a native of Texas. I am a poor family. I have no ability to study. Since I started to understand things, I helped my family and went to work. When I was 16 years old, I got into trouble. The mantle mixed up and let me abolish me. So, I quickly fled my hometown and went to Beijing to join an acquaintance.""
Chu Youning asked again: ""What is Zhao, the father of Zhao?""
Hu Yanhai replied on behalf of him: ""The words of the rivers and lakes are the eyes.""
Zhao Yidao continued: ""When I arrived in Beijing, my eyes were dark and no one knew. The acquaintances I was looking for did not find it. I didn't know where to move. I couldn't help myself. I was hungry and I had to find a job. So, Shaking the briquettes, when the coal sunspots. Little dolls, you have to ask, what is the coal blacks, I said first, that is, the small apprentice who shakes the coal ball, the body is dyed black by coal, called coal blacks. Shake the briquettes, bitter. The broken coal pieces are mixed with the sticky loess, then put into the simmer and shaken into a round briquettes.""
""There is no way, big characters don't know one. I don't know what I am doing in Beijing. What can I do? One day, I am shaking the briquettes. I have a strong dress and I am passing by. I have a shirt and I am willing to ask me. I don’t want to be a deacon at the punishment department. I didn’t understand my age. When I heard the criminal department, I was afraid of it, and I listened to the deacon. I didn’t understand it. I was paralyzed and stayed there. I don’t know what to answer? That is to say, the tube is eaten, the food is full, there is a bed to sleep, and the body is clean. I understand this, and nodded on the spot, I followed.""
""This martial arts man, called Jiang Yong, was the descendant of the Jiang family and the five tigers. At that time, he was a deacon of the criminal department, that is, the Beijing city hacked the head scorpion. He took me home, the Jiang family compound, in the south of Beijing, where the poor There are many people. Beijing, it is said that it is rich in the east and the west is rich in poverty. It is said that there are many rich people in the east city, many people in the west city, many poor people in the south city, and many people in the low-lying city in the north city. This is true or false, I am in Beijing. For many years, I have always said that it is unclear. Some people have iron teeth, which is hard to say. Others say that this is pure nonsense. Whether it is true or false, it is said that the Jiang Family Courtyard is located in Nancheng. They are all descendants of the Jiang family.""
