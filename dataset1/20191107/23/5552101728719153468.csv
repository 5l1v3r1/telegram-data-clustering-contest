【看懂韓粉2】眷戀台灣錢淹腳目年代　他們相信韓能讓子孫發大財
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 鄒保祥, 陳毅偉
屏東是台灣所得最低的縣市之一，卻有全台灣最鋼鐵的韓粉組織。王豪餘開著賓士，載我們在屏東市區四處逛，一邊介紹「屏東韓家軍」集資做成的韓國瑜看版。他說自己從30年前的第一台車就是賓士：「以前拚的時候，一天睡3個小時，你說不累嗎？我只要想到我這麼努力工作，會有相對應的報酬就不累了。」
王豪餘來自比屏東更窮的鄉下：雲林湖口。父親早死，只好到台北當學徒，做過水電工，也做過廣告看板學徒。工作空閒時，還到百貨公司附近攤地攤。相類似的故事也發生在另一位屏東韓家軍成員劉輝政身上，60歲的他出生屏東農村，因為太窮，從小過繼給別人，養父因案入獄，他最後只能到孤兒院度過童年，他突破人生的方式依舊是離家北上念軍校。


從去年底開始，全台掀起韓流狂潮，這群人以國旗衣做為辨識彼此的符號。

劉輝政一輩子追求脫貧，軍校畢業後，搭上「投資熱潮」成了當時地下投資公司一員。儘管「好幾千萬投下去，就這樣沒了。」但他依舊對當年掛著副總頭銜，出入有司機的美好日子念念不忘。投資失敗，妻子也跑了，沒有關係，他一無所有回到屏東做起水電、裝潢工作，依舊存活下來。
王豪餘則在70到80年代房市狂飆時做起房產代銷，景氣一波過去，公司倒閉。王豪餘沒有低潮太久。壽險業在1987年自由化之後，新興商家多達二十幾家，王豪餘可以輕易找到轉職機會。他從門檻不高的保險業務做起，因為喜歡跟人親近，性格開朗，很快就做出業績，3年之間成了屏東地方的業務總監，也是全公司最年輕的主管。
彼時，以美援和黃金儲備做為穩定的基本要素，隨著農村的土地改革與機械化生產，多餘人力開始可以外流都市尋找生命的出路。而中國才在起步，台灣在全球分工產業鍊上佔據優勢的位子，經濟帶來的好處影響整個世代，包括對未來的想像：經濟會無止境成長，未來會更好。〈明天會更好〉這首流行歌曲，正是戰後嬰兒潮這世代的集體精神樣貌。
人生經驗讓他們堅信「沒有什麼苦不苦，努力撐下去就有回報。」當王豪餘看見現今年輕人重複在浪底翻滾、缺乏出路，使他期待台灣能再度出現一位他成長時的強人領袖前總統蔣經國，帶他們回到過去。而那人就是韓國瑜。2018年，他因北農總經理的位置被擠下，宣布參選高雄市長，以「打造高雄，全台首富」作為競選主軸，竟以黑馬之姿順利當選。

[Read Han Powder 2] I love Taiwan’s money and flooded the eyes. They believe that Han can make children and grandchildren
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Zou Baoxiang, Chen Yiwei
Pingtung is one of the lowest counties and cities in Taiwan, but it has the most steel-organized Korean powder organization in Taiwan. Wang Haoyu opened a guest, carrying us in the city of Pingtung, and introduced the Korean Yu watch version made by the ""Pingdong Han Jiajun"". He said that the first car he had 30 years ago was a guest: ""When I used to fight, I slept for 3 hours a day. Are you tired? I just think that if I work so hard, I will not be tired of the corresponding compensation. It is.""
Wang Haoyu comes from a poorer country than Pingtung: Yunlin Hukou. When his father died early, he had to go to Taipei to be an apprentice, a plumber, and an apprentice apprentice. When the work is idle, I will also go to the stalls near the department store. A similar story happened to another member of Pingtung Han Jiajun, Liu Huizheng. At the age of 60, he was born in Pingtung countryside. Because he was too poor, he was given to others from a young age. The adoptive father was imprisoned because of the case. He finally went to the orphanage. In childhood, his way of breaking through life is still to go to the north to go to the military school.


Since the end of last year, the whole Taiwan has set off a wave of Korean Waves. This group of people uses the flag coat as a symbol to identify each other.

Liu Huizheng pursued poverty all his life. After graduating from the military academy, he joined the ""investment boom"" and became a member of the underground investment company. Although ""there are tens of millions of casts, it's gone."" But he still remembers the deputy general title of the year, and he never misses the good days of having a driver. The investment failed, and the wife ran away. It didn't matter. He returned to Pingtung to do water and electricity and decorate work, and he still survived.
Wang Haoyu started the real estate agency sales in the 70s and 80s when the housing market was arrogant. The company went bankrupt and the company closed down. Wang Haoyu did not have a low tide for too long. After the life insurance industry was liberalized in 1987, there were more than 20 emerging businesses, and Wang Haoyu could easily find a job change opportunity. He started from the low-risk insurance business, because he likes to be close to people, is cheerful, and quickly made achievements. In the past three years, he became the business director of Pingtung and the youngest director of the company.
At that time, with US aid and gold reserves as the basic elements of stability, with the rural land reform and mechanized production, the surplus manpower can begin to find a way out of life in the outflow city. China is only starting. Taiwan has an advantage in the global industrial chain. The benefits of the economy affect the entire generation, including the imagination of the future: the economy will grow endlessly and the future will be better. ""Tomorrow will be better"" This popular song is the collective spirit of the generation of baby boomers after the war.
The experience of life has made them firmly believe that ""there is no hardship and hardship. If you work hard, you will have a reward."" When Wang Haoyu saw that the young people are now rolling over at the bottom of the wave and lacking a way out, he hopes that Taiwan will once again have a strong man when he grows up. Former President Chiang Ching-kuo took them back to the past. And that person is Korean Yu. In 2018, he was squeezed by the position of General Manager of North Agriculture, and announced his candidacy for Kaohsiung Mayor. He was selected as the mainstay of the campaign by ""Building Kaohsiung, the richest man in Taiwan"" and was elected as a black horse.
