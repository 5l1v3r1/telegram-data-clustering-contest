９月消費支出、過去最大９・５％増…増税前の駆け込み需要

07 Nov 2019, 23:39

　総務省が８日発表した９月の家計調査によると、１世帯（２人以上）あたりの消費支出は３０万６０９円となり、物価変動の影響を除いた実質で前年同月から９・５％増加した。増加幅は比較が可能な２００１年以降で最大となった。
　１０月の消費税率引き上げを前に、高額商品などで一定の駆け込み需要が起きた。昨年９月に台風２１号の被害で消費支出が落ち込んだ反動も出た。
　消費税率が８％に引き上げられる前の１４年３月は、伸び率が７・２％だった。増税幅が違うことなどもあり、総務省は「前回と今回で駆け込み需要の大きさは比較出来ない」としている。
　今回の調査を項目別にみると、１０項目のうち９項目で増加した。冷蔵庫やエアコンなど高額の家庭用耐久財を含む「家具・家事用品」が６０・３％、眼鏡やマスクなどの「保健医療」が２６・３％、定期代などの「交通・通信」が１５・４％と高い伸びを示した。設備修繕などの「住居」（１１・０％）、テレビやパソコン、宿泊などの「教養娯楽」（１０・８％）なども好調だった。
　総務省は「今回だけでは消費の基調は判断できず、今後の動きを注視する」としている。
