Lexus has rolled out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto across its line-up, but existing owners haven't been left in the cold.
The ES mid-sized sedan and RX SUV were the first two models to get the technology in October, while the mid-sized NX SUV, range-topping LS sedan, and the RC and LC coupe line-ups have been outfitted with the system since November 1.
Finally, all UX SUVs sold from December 1 onwards will have the technology. The BMW 3 Series-rivalling IS sedan misses out though, for now.
Owners of the following models are eligible to have the technology retrofitted to their cars – it costs $249, and the work takes around an hour to complete:


NX produced from September 1, 2017


ES produced from July 4, 2018


RC/RC F produced from November 27, 2017


LC (all models)


LS produced from January 8, 2018


UX (all models)


The move from Lexus follows an announcement from Toyota, which last week revealed owners of some models will be able to pay $199 to have the technology retrofitted in their vehicles.
Mazda was the first to offer a retrofit for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Owners of vehicles with MZD Connect infotainment systems dating back to 2014 can pay $495 to have the software on their cars upgraded, and the hardware of their USB ports improved to support it.
