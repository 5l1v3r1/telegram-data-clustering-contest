      <h1>Jeremy Corbyn does Live at the Apollo - and it sums up his whole general election campaign</h1>
      <h2>Not the Hammersmith Apollo on BBC Two, but the Manchester Apollo - and a crowd of hundreds of cheering Labour backers. Dan Bloom saw a show that was well-worn but told from the heart</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T23:03:03+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>"ManchestEEER!" bellowed Angela Rayner.</p>
      <p>"It’s an absolute pleasure to be LIVE AT THE APOLLO!"</p>
      <p>Sure, there was no Michael McIntyre. No primetime TV audience. The warm-up act was the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate for West Derby.</p>
      <p>And the jokes weren't that funny...</p>
      <p>... Actually, maybe it was a bit like Live at the Apollo after all.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn's gigs - sorry, rallies - have always felt as much like crowd-participation live drama as a political event.</p>
      <p>And Thursday night's, at Manchester's Apollo, showed he has no plan to reinvent the wheel he's rolled on since gaining those seats in 2017.</p>

      <p>The Labour activists cheered, chanted, stood and waved placards emblazoned "it's time for real change" as Labour's leader worked the crowd for 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>Little to none of it was 'news' in the traditional sense.</p>
      <p>Sure, there were plenty of policies, but all announced before, for anyone who bothers to get on Google.</p>
      <p>The thing is - and we in Westminster do forget this - to this crowd of ultra-faithful it doesn't matter a jot.</p>
      <p>The cut-and-thrust of the campaign matters less than the feeling of being part of a spectacle, a movement.</p>
      <p>They chanted "not! for! sale!" - the mantra of the 2019 campaign - as he warned of an NHS sell-out to Donald Trump.</p>

      <p>They booed the Lib Dems, who leapt on the event with a blazing ad van declaring "Only Lib Dems will stop Brexit."</p>
      <p>They laughed as Corbyn boasted of his £1m in small donations: "I was going to call all my billionaire friends until I realised I didn’t have any!"</p>
      <p>And one shouted "w***er!" as Corbyn told how Boris Johnson would crash Britain out of the EU with no deal.</p>
      <p>"It's not pantomime season yet!" Corbyn cried, the stage lightbulbs blazing behind him.</p>
      <p>Agree with any of it or none, anyone can see how the atmosphere jars with images of Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>On the day Labour unveiled its bog-standard campaign bus, the Prime Minister toured the country in a private jet he nicknamed 'Con Air'.</p>

      <p>Insulated from the public, the PM has issued videos of himself from the back of a chauffeur-driven Merc.</p>
      <p>And just compare the rote-learned "get Brexit dones" and "oven-ready deals" with Angela Rayner's warm-up speech.</p>
      <p>"I was that kid who grew up in a council house," she said. "My mum was from Wythenshawe and couldn’t read or write. I left school without qualifications, pregnant at 16.</p>

      <p>"l felt ashamed of who I was. I felt I was nothing. And I remember at the time there was a Tory minister at the time saying girls like me were getting pregnant to get council housing. That's what they think".</p>
      <p>The story is well-worn, but it was told with genuine passion and anger, spoken from the heart.</p>
      <p>All of these, as it happens, are things you could say about Labour's election campaign.</p>
      <p>The real question is whether its fanbase will grow from cult theatre hit to primetime on BBC Two.</p>
      <p>Only on December 13 will we really know the answer.</p>
