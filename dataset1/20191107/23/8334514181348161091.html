      <p>“My understanding is Brown is eager to present his side &amp; that there r teams still interested in signing him pending the resolution of the league’s investigation,” ESPN reporter Josina Anderson tweeted on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Hours later, Brown took to social media to vent his frustration with the league.</p>
      <p>“Imagine conforming to a system giving it a 100 percent to see them treat me like this is unfairly!” Brown wrote on Twitter. “Making money off my sweat and blood (expletive) the @nfl I’ll never play in that (expletive) treat black people the worse! Clear my name and go (expletive) your self.”</p>
      <p>Brown later deleted the tweet and posted a new one, writing, “I’m just very frustrated right now with the false allegations and slander to my name. I love football and I miss it. I just want to play and I’m very emotional about that. I’m determined to make my way back to the NFL asap.”</p>
      <p>Brown, 31, initially tweeted on Sept. 22 that he “will not be playing in the NFL anymore.”</p>
      <p>That tweet came two days after the New England Patriots released him.</p>
      <p>The NFL released a statement on Sept. 20 that said Brown would not be placed on the commissioner’s exempt list while he is a free agent but warned, “If he is signed by a club, such placement may become appropriate at any time depending on the status of the investigation.”</p>
      <p>Brown was cut by the Oakland Raiders on Sept. 7 and then signed with the Patriots. He played in one game, catching four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown in New England’s 43-0 win at Miami on Sept. 15.</p>
      <p>The four-time All-Pro has been under investigation by the NFL under its personal conduct policy since former trainer Britney Taylor filed a lawsuit in September alleging that she was sexually assaulted on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>In 10 NFL seasons (the first nine with the Pittsburgh Steelers), Brown has 841 catches for 11,263 yards and 75 touchdowns.</p>
