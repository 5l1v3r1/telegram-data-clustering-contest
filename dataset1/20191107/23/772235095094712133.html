      <p><b>Lexus</b> has rolled out <b>Apple CarPlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>Android Auto</b> across its line-up, but existing owners haven't been left in the cold.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-es/">ES mid-sized sedan</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-rx/">RX SUV</a> were the first two models to get the technology in October, while the mid-sized <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-nx/">NX SUV</a>, range-topping <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-ls/">LS sedan</a>, and the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-rc/">RC</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-lc/">LC</a> coupe line-ups have been outfitted with the system since November 1.</p>
      <p>Finally, all <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-ux/">UX SUVs</a> sold from December 1 onwards will have the technology. The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/3-series/">BMW 3 Series</a>-rivalling <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lexus-is/">IS sedan</a> misses out though, for now.</p>
      <p>Owners of the following models are eligible to have the technology retrofitted to their cars â€“ it costs <b>$249,</b> and the work takes around an hour to complete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>NX produced from September 1, 2017</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ES produced from July 4, 2018</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RC/RC F produced from November 27, 2017</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>LC (all models)</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>LS produced from January 8, 2018</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UX (all models)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The move from Lexus follows an announcement from Toyota, which last week <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/804992/toyota-apple-carplay-retrofit/">revealed owners of some models will be able to pay $199 to have the technology retrofitted in their vehicles</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/">Mazda</a> was the first to offer a retrofit for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Owners of vehicles with MZD Connect infotainment systems dating back to 2014 can pay $495 to have the software on their cars upgraded, and the hardware of their USB ports improved to support it.</p>
