【看懂韓粉6】在美好回憶裡取暖　韓粉眼中的韓國瑜就是「他」
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 攝影組
陳先生說，他工廠的生意自90年代中開始受中國競爭影響，因不願離鄉背井，決定關掉工廠。他一方面認為這是世界趨勢，但眼看一海之隔的窮困國家，10年之間戲劇性成了經濟巨龍，焦慮開始蔓延。這使陳先生與其他韓粉一樣，堅信台灣近20年來的經濟停滯，是出於民進黨的政治鬥爭。「你看中國大陸就是因為有一個有魄力的政府，才會有現在繁榮的狀況。」王豪餘這幾年，也把小孩送到中國「實習」：「我要他們看中國怎麼花錢，支付寶、消費金融的創新都比台灣進步很多。」
瞿宛文雖認為政府的干預可有效創造有利經濟發展的環境，但「威權政體和經濟發展之間並沒有任何必然的關係」「威權體制不見得能帶來穩定環境」。瞿宛文的研究也同時認為，戰後國民黨政府，以「救亡圖存」的民族情緒作為動員能量，來推動經濟發展。台灣經濟奇蹟是結合民族主義的特定時空下的產物，韓粉們戒嚴時代的生命經驗也充滿亡國感，風雨飄搖的小島，好像隨時就要翻覆，「經濟發展」「繁榮自由寶島」是大家唯一能拉住的救命繩索。

國終究是沒有亡，但帶來的卻是雙重的失落感。90年代後，韓粉們不僅面對一個經濟光榮不再的社會，同時曾經被動員的愛國情操突然在民主多元的社會裡找不到安放的位子。那些在造勢大會上看著國旗流淚的人們，他們懷念過去的經濟奇蹟，同時也懷念威權政體將大家緊緊綁在一起的日子，而蔣經國正是大家對那個年代的想望。
韓國瑜多次的演講和採訪不斷提及「四小龍」神話、「看少棒」的共同記憶，企圖喚起的是韓粉記憶裡那段「亡國」的日子（許多韓粉擔心中華民國不見了、國旗被消滅了），以及圍繞在經濟發展下的各種愛國情緒和保守價值。一位政治工作者表示：「韓國瑜一開始就說，民進黨對台灣民主有貢獻，但現在台灣人民已經不欠民進黨了，他把關注從民主價值拉開，專注在生活經濟問題。」


所有的韓粉對過往的經濟奇蹟、亞洲四小龍的神話津津樂道。

韓粉汲汲營營「發大財」這種看似可笑的信念，其實含括一個更深層的情緒，美國內華達大學助理教王宏恩說：「支撐許多外省族群一直待在台灣，跟親人分離數十年的理由，過去是反攻大陸的信仰，反攻無望後就是台灣比較好的光榮感，假如現在台灣沒有中國好，還有甚麼能支持他們這段破碎的人生呢？」
種種困頓與挫敗，讓韓粉更為焦慮地期待國家給出答案。然而民進黨的兩岸主張，卻一再摧毀韓粉對穩定進步的想像。於此同時，民進黨的支持者，還一再否定韓國瑜的各種政見，這讓韓粉自然不能放過任何「詆毀者」。
北市立醫院松德院區精神科醫生蔡榮裕，以精神分析的角度看這群想回到過去的人：「他們要的名字是中華民國，但他們想回去的地方早就不存在，或是只能安放在被管控的紀念館裡，當有人提醒他們回不去了，便衍生『無處可去』的恨意和不滿，向說的人射去。」
韓粉潛意識知道，過去的經濟光榮感和社會的單一集體認同感，已隨著時代不同而轉變。好比，過去齊頭式的平等，仰賴政府高度介入，隨著市場經濟開放，政府力量也被限縮。在這種不切實際的期待中，韓粉陷入困頓的現實。李俊毅進一步指出：「當人遇到現實挑戰，通常會有二種回應，其一是重新審視現實並做回改正，其一則是現實困頓太強烈了，只好築起錯覺高牆隔絕現實。」
韓粉們眼前只有困境和失落，只要這些焦慮不斷被挑起，韓國瑜的各種失言和想像力十足的政見都能被忽略。李俊毅以高雄大選為例：「韓國瑜要高雄市民不要想像他會做什麼…重要的是你要渴望他會做什麼。…他並不是來「解決」高雄困境的，而是來讓大家「忘掉」高雄困境的。」
現實愈困頓，錯覺之牆就需要被建得更高。錯覺的高牆拒絕了未來，韓粉只好從過去的回憶裡，撈取可供取暖的符號，維持心理唯一的感情連繫，韓國瑜旋風把這群時代的遺民全都捲了進來，一同過著一個二手的時代，但他們仍如此自信，相信自己終於站在歷史的浪頭上。

[Learning Korean powder 6] Warming up in good memories Korean Yu in the eyes of Korean powder is ""he""
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Photography Group
Mr. Chen said that his factory's business has been affected by Chinese competition since the mid-1990s, and he decided to shut down the factory because he did not want to leave his hometown. On the one hand, he believes that this is a world trend, but seeing the poor countries separated by the sea, the drama has become an economic dragon in 10 years, and anxiety has begun to spread. This makes Mr. Chen, like other Han powder, firmly believe that Taiwan’s economic stagnation in the past 20 years is due to the political struggle of the DPP. ""You see China's mainland because there is a government that is strong, and there will be a situation of prosperity now."" Wang Haoyu also sent children to China for ""internships"" in the past few years: ""I want them to see how China spends money, Alipay, The innovation of consumer finance is much more advanced than that of Taiwan.""
Although Yan Wanwen believes that government intervention can effectively create an environment conducive to economic development, there is no necessary relationship between authoritarian regimes and economic development. ""The authoritarian system does not necessarily bring about a stable environment."" Yan Wanwen’s research also believes that after the war, the Kuomintang government used the national sentiment of “salvation and saving” as a mobilizing energy to promote economic development. Taiwan's economic miracle is a product of a specific time and space combined with nationalism. The life experience of the Han dynasty in the era of martial law is also full of sense of national ruin. The stormy island seems to be overturned at any time. ""Economic development"" and ""prosperous and free treasure island"" are the only ones who can Pull the lifeline.

After all, the country has not died, but it brings a sense of double loss. After the 1990s, the Korean powder not only faced a society where the economy was no longer glorious, but the patriotic sentiment that was once mobilized suddenly could not find a seat in a democratic and pluralistic society. Those who watched the national flags in tears at the conference, they missed the economic miracles of the past, and also missed the days when the authoritarian regimes tied everyone together, and Chiang Ching-kuo was everyone’s hope for that era.
Many speeches and interviews by South Korea Yu have repeatedly mentioned the common memory of the ""Four Little Dragons"" mythology and ""Looking at the Little"". The attempt to evoke the ""death"" of the Korean powder memory (many Han powder worried that the Republic of China is gone. The flag has been eliminated), as well as various patriotic sentiments and conservative values surrounding economic development. A political worker said: ""Korean Yu said at the beginning that the DPP has contributed to Taiwan's democracy, but now the Taiwanese people are not owed to the DPP. He has focused his attention on democratic values and focused on economic issues. .""


All the Korean powder is relished by the economic miracles of the past and the myth of the Asian Tigers.

The seemingly ridiculous belief in the ""big money"" camp of Hanamaki Camp actually includes a deeper sentiment. Wang Hongen, an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, said: ""Supporting many foreign provinces has been staying in Taiwan and separated from their loved ones. The reason for the year is that the past is the counter-attack of the mainland's beliefs. After the counterattack is hopeless, Taiwan is a better sense of glory. If Taiwan does not have China, what can support this broken life?""
All kinds of difficulties and frustrations made Han powder more anxious to expect the country to give an answer. However, the DPP’s cross-strait proposition has repeatedly destroyed Han’s imagination of stability and progress. At the same time, the supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party have repeatedly denied the various political views of South Korea, which made it impossible for Han powder to let go of any ""destroyers.""
Cai Rongyu, a psychiatrist at Songde Hospital of North City Hospital, looks at this group of people who want to go back to the past with a psychoanalytic perspective: ""They want the name of the Republic of China, but the place they want to go back does not exist, or only Can be placed in the controlled memorial hall, when someone reminds them that they can't go back, they will be born with the hatred and dissatisfaction of ""nowhere to go"" and shoot at the person who said it.""
Han Min subconsciously knows that the past economic glory and the single collective identity of society have changed with the times. For example, the past equality has depended on the government's high level of involvement. As the market economy opened up, government power was also limited. In this unrealistic expectation, Han powder has fallen into a difficult reality. Li Junyi further pointed out: ""When people encounter realistic challenges, there are usually two kinds of responses. One is to re-examine the reality and make corrections. The other is that the reality is too strong, and it is necessary to build up the illusion and isolate the reality.""
The Korean powder people only have difficulties and losses. As long as these anxietyes are provoked, the various sorrows and imaginative political views of South Korea’s Yu can be ignored. Li Junyi takes the Kaohsiung election as an example: ""Korean Yu wants Kaohsiung citizens not to imagine what he will do... What is important is that you want to be eager to do what he does.... He does not come to ""solve"" Kaohsiung's predicament, but to let everyone ""forget about it."" Kaohsiung is in trouble. ""
The more difficult the reality is, the wall of illusion needs to be built higher. The illusion of the high wall rejected the future. Han powder had to take the symbols of warmth from the memories of the past and maintain the only emotional connection of the mind. The Korean whirlwinds rolled all the remnants of this era and lived together. Second-hand era, but they are still so confident, I believe that I finally stood on the wave of history.
