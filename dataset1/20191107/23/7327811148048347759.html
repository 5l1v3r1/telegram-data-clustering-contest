      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- By daybreak on Friday, temperatures will plummet and the added wind chill will make it feel like 25 degrees in Central Park and even colder to the north and west.</p>
      <p>A fast-moving system will bring some light snow to higher elevations overnight, but for most of us, the story is the arrival of the coldest air of the season.</p>
      <p>As the cold air arrives on the backside of the front, some snow can be expected in the Poconos and Catskills.</p>
