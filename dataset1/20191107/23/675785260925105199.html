      <p>Emmerdale viewers have predicted an impostor twist will hit the Dales, after Lydia Hart's discovery about her benefactor.</p>
      <p>She learned her recent windfall came from her mother Agatha Finn, who had her placed up for adoption when she was a child.</p>
      <p>But after trying to track her down, she learned the heartbreaking news her mother had passed away three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The news came from her secret sister she didn't even know existed, while it was quickly clear she was hiding someting.</p>
      <p>She was pretty quick in getting Lydia away from the house, and avoided letting her in or even having a proper conversation with her.</p>

      <p>As the episode ended it appeared to be confirmed she was lying about their mother, who was very much alive in the house.</p>
      <p>Now, viewers think there is more to the storyline and that her mother's true fate might not be the only lie.</p>
      <p>Viewers were quick to praise the soap for the casting of Lydia's sister, stating how alike the two actresses look.</p>

      <p>But this then led to a new theory, with fans questioning whether the newcomer is even Lydia's sister at all.</p>
      <p>They're now wondering if she could in fact be posing as Lydia, pretending to be her given the fact the mother and daughter were separated years ago.</p>
      <p>There's also the fact that Agatha had heard about her daughter from the recent newspaper report confirming a baby's remains had been discovered at the school - it was Lydia, real name Jenny Finn, who buried her baby who died during childbirth.</p>

      <p>So could the mystery sister have seen an opportunity, and taken on Lydia/Jenny's identity?</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "She is impersonating Lydia to steal her Mum's money... bookmark me!"</p>
      <p>Another asked: "Is it really Lydia's sister though."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "This sister is acting very suspiciously."</p>
