      <p>There were several picture from inside the house, including snaps of Cara and Poppy's bedrooms.</p>

      <p>She described the ordeal as "hysterical".</p>

      <p>"It was hysterical - we needed to pee so badly but we were on a party bus and we were like, 'let's get out at McDonald's'.</p>
      <p>"They wouldn't let us use the toilets so we just peed outside on the lawn outside it."</p>
      <p>Cara unveiled more details of the night out, adding: "She's one of my really close friends. She's a babe.</p>
      <p>"I was with her last week - I had a reunion with a lot of my English girlfriends and she came long and she was the person there that no one knew, because she's my newest friend."</p>
