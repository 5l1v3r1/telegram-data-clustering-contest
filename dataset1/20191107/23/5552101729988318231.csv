【看懂韓粉番外篇】每個韓粉生命中都有一個韓國瑜（上）
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 鄭進耀, 賴智揚
每一位韓粉的人生軌跡裡都有一個韓國瑜。
41歲的游偵敏去年底大選挺韓，剃了大光頭，最近頭髮變長了：「我之前留妹妹頭，臉書常把我的照片辦認成蔡英文，我很賭爛。」她前陣子又搭上流行，跟著拍了「韓粉開箱文」，穿著國旗比基尼，擺出各式韓國瑜週邊商品一同入鏡拍照。
為什麼支持韓國瑜？「因為他愛國，他說自己是三民主義的追隨者。」愛國很重要，游禎敏有一個念小學的女兒，她看過女兒的升旗典禮：「現在的小孩不知道唱國歌、升旗還動來動去，根本不知道什麼是愛國。」愛國對游禎敏是生活中重要的事：「我一緊張、不開心，就會唱國歌…以前我最拿手的科目是三民主義，差1分就滿分。」
她申論什麼是愛國：「軍人保衛國家是愛國，我從小走路靠右邊走，連地上撿垃圾我覺得都是愛國的表現。」她認為全台灣最愛國的人是眷村的老兵還有學校的教官：「教官教你什麼是禮義廉恥、什麼是國家和國旗。」
如此愛國的奇女子，前大半生卻是一個被國家體制所拋棄的人。她來自花蓮，父親是貨車司機，她的母親是父親的第二任妻子，雖不是外省人，卻因為家境貧困，只能租得起在桃園眷村裡破舊的小房子過日子。父親一喝醉就打母親，母親是2個小孩的繼母，保守的年代還受盡鄰居的耳語歧視。母親一受了委屈就找唯一的親生女兒出氣：「她常打我、罵我：為什麼我生的，不會比別人更好？」
母親不愛她，父親又家暴：「我童年唯一覺得被愛的時候，是跟我爸的貨車出去，途中他買維大力汽水給我喝。」現下的生活若不如意，她除了唱唱國歌之外，便是喝維大力。家庭破碎，對外又得面臨貧困的掙扎：「學校有營養午餐，雞腿肉捨不得吃，帶回家，上課中途伸手去捏一小塊一小塊偷吃，回家時，雞腿上都一點一點被捉破像星星的痕跡。」
衣服是撿別人剩的，下課就到工廠當童工，織毛衣、組電子零件、幫小禮品上漆，這些工作都做過。年紀大一點，她到餐廳端盤子：「像我們這樣的家庭出來的，最後不是去做酒店就是去當檳榔西施，但我沒有，我現在有5間房子。」游禎敏的手上有淡淡的刺青，她也不掩飾：「我以前混過太妹，我不怕死，打架打起來很可怕。」

為什麼不怕死？她覺得從來沒有被愛，這麼努力，受盡各種委屈，都沒得到應得的愛：「真的對我好的，只有眷村裡的老杯杯們，他們單身一人，把我當成自己的小孩。」混太妹是對原生家庭的反叛，「老兵教我基本的道德，做人的道理，我在外面混，打人什麼的，但毒品和淫亂我是不碰的。」混了1、2年，她自省日子這樣下去不是辦法，決定回頭求教官，讓她回校念書。
她順利以優秀的成績畢業，之後插班考上大學英文系，畢業後開了英語補習班，之後因少子化的關係，結束營業，帶著女兒到中壢當起房仲，因為比別人認真，第1年的業績就已是全國第29名。「我跟韓國瑜一樣，不怕苦，所以能存活下來。」
這種不怕苦的底層翻身故事，一直是台灣人熱愛的勵志故事。游禎敏告訴我們，在韓國瑜之前，她支持過的政治人物是：陳水扁。「他在立法院時，很努力，我家還有幾個阿扁娃娃。」她並不是特例，雲林的退休老師林先生長期是綠營支持者，他的兒子說：「阿扁下台時，我爸很失落，覺得自己的夢想好像破滅了。」
林老師也是出身雲林的貧農家庭，是村子裡唯一念大學的小孩，畢業後回鄉教書，是地方上眾人器重的知識分子。對林老師來說，貧農出生的陳水扁就是他的化身，被包裝成庶民總統韓國瑜也召喚了他同樣的情感，再加上年改政策，林老師義無返顧成為鋼鐵韓粉。
游禎敏說韓國瑜很敢衝、很努力，這些形容同樣也可以放在陳水扁身上。外界總認為韓粉在政治光譜上屬急統，但我們實地採訪卻發現在韓粉在統獨立場上，立場並不一致，從「華獨」到保持現狀、支持九二共識甚至到接受一國二制的聲音都有。林濁水分析，韓粉吸納了許多社會底層，這些底層一直熱愛庶民翻身的神話，很可能原本就扁迷，現在納在韓粉的群體裡，統獨差異被刻意隱去。
成為鋼鐵韓粉的過程也非單一因素，訪談到最後，游禎敏說起自己的女兒：「我一輩子沒被愛過，我怕我愛不了自己的孩子，當媽媽之前還特別去幼保科旁聽，學習如何照顧、愛一個小孩。」雖然順利當了媽媽，最後還是因為相處問題，和平地和丈夫離婚，成了單親媽媽。小孩3歲時，游禎敏罹癌，激烈的化療過程，她日日抱著馬桶嘔吐，但這不是最難受的：「最難過的是小孩要妳抱她，妳卻抱不了她，眼睜睜看她在哭。」
她語氣一轉：「當了媽媽之後，你才能理解，當女兒問你，同學家裡有2個媽媽、為什麼同志遊行的人身上只遮一塊布在胯下，那種憂心，你不是媽媽你不會知道。」相較於統獨立場的分歧，韓粉們在性別、環保議題上的保守態度是近乎一致：「我不是討厭蔡英文，但一個沒結婚當媽媽的女人，可以理解我們的辛苦嗎？」
游禎敏一直相信古文說的：「齊家治國平天下。」她解釋：「一個好的家庭，你才會有打拚的動力…韓國瑜的家庭這麼幸福，一定有辦法把國家帶到對的方向。」韓粉縱使對蔡英文執政有再多的不滿，同婚爭議更是催毀他們根深蒂固對家庭的刻板想像，對他們來說，不僅國沒了，現在連家也要毀了。
政治選舉很多時候就是一場大型圓夢計劃。對游禎敏來說，生命裡匱乏的經驗，在成為韓粉之後，替代性地擁有了那些不曾擁有的一切。她現在每天看YouTube上的各種挺韓國瑜的影片：「我跟女兒說，韓國瑜真是一個了不起的人。」除了唱國歌、喝維大力，現在她還多了一個選擇：看韓國瑜的影片。說起來，韓國瑜的參選也算是功德一件。

[See Korean powder outside the article] Every Korean powder has a Korean Yu (on)
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Zheng Jinyao, Lai Zhiyang
There is a Korean Yu in the life track of every Korean powder.
The 41-year-old You Zhenmin was very popular at the end of last year. He shaved his head and his hair became longer. ""I used to stay in my sister's head. Facebook often recognizes my photo as Tsai Ing-wen. I am very bad."" A while ago, I got on the pop, and I took a picture of ""Korean Powder Open Box"", wearing a national flag bikini and posing a variety of Korean Yu products.
Why support Korean Yu? ""Because he is patriotic, he said that he is a follower of the Three People's Principles."" Patriotic is very important. You Minmin has a daughter who is in elementary school. She has seen her daughter's flag-raising ceremony: ""Now the children don't know how to sing the national anthem and raise the flag. Going, I don’t know what is patriotic.” Patriotic vs. You Minmin is an important thing in life: “When I am nervous and unhappy, I will sing the national anthem... The subject I used to be the best is the Three People’s Principles. ""
She is proposing what is patriotic: ""The military defends the country is patriotic. I walked from the small to the right. I even felt that the garbage on the ground was a patriotic performance."" She believes that the most patriotic person in Taiwan is the veteran of the village and the school. Instructor: ""The instructor teaches you what is ethics, what is the country and the national flag.""
Such a patriotic woman, most of her life, is a person abandoned by the state system. She is from Hualien, her father is a truck driver, and her mother is the father's second wife. Although she is not a foreigner, she can only afford to live in a dilapidated small house in Taoyuanyu Village because of her poverty. When the father was drunk, he beat his mother. The mother was the stepmother of two children. In the conservative era, he was also discriminated against by neighbors. When the mother was wronged, she found the only biological daughter: ""She often beats me and yells at me: Why am I born better than others?""
The mother does not love her, and her father is also violent: ""When I felt that I was loved in my childhood, I went out with my dad's van. On the way, he bought Weiwei's powerful soda for me."" If she is not happy, she will sing the national anthem. In addition, it is to drink vigorously. The family is broken, and the outside world has to face the struggle of poverty: ""The school has a nutritious lunch. The chicken legs are reluctant to eat, take home, and reach out to pick up a small piece to steal food during class. When you go home, the chicken legs are one by one. The point was captured like a trace of the stars.""
The clothes are left to others, and they go to the factory as a child laborer in the class, knitting sweaters, group electronic parts, and helping small gifts to be painted. These jobs have been done. When she was a little older, she went to the restaurant side plate: ""The family like us came out, but the last time I didn't go to the hotel, I went to betel nut, but I didn't. I have 5 houses now."" You Minmin's hand has a touch of light. Tattoo, she did not hide: ""I used to mix with Taimei, I am not afraid of death, fighting is terrible.""


The open box of You Minmin wearing a bikini caused a hot discussion on the Internet. (provided by You Minmin)

Why are you not afraid of death? She felt that she had never been loved, so hard, and suffered all kinds of grievances, and did not get the love she deserved: ""Really good for me, only the old cups in the village, they are single, and treat me as their own. ""Children."" Mixed Taimei is a rebellion against the original family. ""The veterans taught me the basic morality, the truth of being a man, I am mixing outside, hitting people, but I don't touch drugs and fornication."" In 2 years, her introspection was not the way to go, and she decided to go back to the instructor and let her go back to school.
She successfully graduated with excellent grades. After that, she was admitted to the English Department of the university. After graduation, she opened an English tutoring class. After that, she ended her business because of her childless relationship. She took her daughter to Zhongli as a housekeeper because she was more serious than others. The performance of the first year is already the 29th in the country. ""I am just like Korean Yu, I am not afraid of suffering, so I can survive.""
This story of the bottom of the story, which is not afraid of suffering, has always been an inspirational story that Taiwanese love. You Minmin told us that before she was in Korea, the political figure she supported was: Chen Shui-bian. ""When he was in the Legislative Yuan, he worked very hard. There are a few A-flat dolls in my family."" She is not a special case. Yunlin’s retired teacher, Mr. Lin, has long been a supporter of the Green Camp. His son said: ""When A-Bian stepped down, my father Very lost, I feel that my dream seems to be shattered.""
Teacher Lin is also a poor peasant family from Yunlin. He is the only child in the village who goes to college. After graduation, he returns to his hometown to teach. He is an intellectual with a lot of talent in the locality. For Teacher Lin, Chen Shui-bian, born of a poor peasant, is his embodiment. He was also packaged as the president of the Republic of Korea, and he also summoned his same feelings. Together with the policy of changing the year, Mr. Lin did not return to become a steel powder.
You Minmin said that South Korea Yu is very daring and hard working. These descriptions can also be placed on Chen Shui-bian. The outside world always thinks that the Korean powder is urgent in the political spectrum, but our on-the-spot interview found that the position of the Korean powder in the independent field is not consistent, from ""China independence"" to maintaining the status quo, supporting the 1992 consensus and even accepting a country. The sound of the two systems is there. Lin turbid water analysis, Han powder has absorbed many of the bottom of society, these bottom layers have always loved the myth of the people to turn over, it is likely to be flat, and now in the group of Korean powder, the difference between the system and the independence is deliberately hidden.
The process of becoming a steel Korean powder is not a single factor. At the end of the interview, You Minmin talked about his daughter: ""I have never been loved in my life. I am afraid that I can't love my children. When I was a mother, I went to the nursery school. Learn how to care for and love a child."" Although she became a mother, she finally became a single mother because she was divorced peacefully because she got along with her husband. When the child is 3 years old, Yu Min is a cancer, intense chemotherapy process, she is holding the toilet and vomiting every day, but this is not the most uncomfortable: ""The most sad thing is that the child wants to hug her, but she can't hold her, see her. is crying.""
She changed her tone: ""When you are a mother, you can understand. When my daughter asks you, there are 2 mothers in the classmates. Why do the comrades parade only cover a piece of cloth under the armpit? That kind of worry, you are not a mother, you are not I will know."" Compared with the differences between the independent and independent fields, the conservative attitude of the Korean powder on gender and environmental issues is almost the same: ""I don't hate Tsai Ing-wen, but a woman who is not married as a mother can understand our hard work. ?""
You Min has always believed in the ancient saying: ""Qi Jiazhi Guoping the world."" She explained: ""A good family, you will have the motivation to fight hard... Korean Yu family is so happy, there must be a way to bring the country to the right direction Even if Han Fen has more dissatisfaction with Tsai Ing-wen's administration, the dispute over marriage is to ruin their stereotypes of deep-rooted family. For them, not only the country is gone, but now even the family is destroyed.
Political elections are often a big dream project. For You Minmin, the experience that is lacking in life, after becoming a Korean powder, has something that he does not have. She is now watching a variety of Korean videos on YouTube every day: ""I told my daughter that Korean Yu is a great person."" In addition to singing the national anthem and drinking the vitality, she now has another choice: watching Korean Yu's film. . To put it bluntly, the election of South Korea’s Yu is also a merit.
