Juul sued for privacy violations over customer biometric data
07 Nov 2019, 23:01 by Peter Blumberg
Juul Labs Inc. was sued for collecting biometric data from its online customers as a method of verifying they are legally old enough to buy vaping products.
The company was accused in a complaint filed Thursday in Illinois of violating a state law that requires consumer consent for companies to gather sensitive biometric data.
WeWork was hit this week with a similar class-action complaint over its alleged used of facial scans to track people in its shared office spaces without informed written consent, which plaintiffs claim is a violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act.
