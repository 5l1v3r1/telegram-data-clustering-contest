      <p>(Reuters) - The Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s busiest for ocean trade with China, processed fewer containers of imported and exported goods in October as the U.S.-China trade war roils the domestic economy and global supply chains.</p>
      <p>October imports dropped 19% to 392,768.6 TEU - or 20-foot equivalent unit - versus a year ago. Exports also fell 19%, landing at 140,331.5 TEU. A TEU is a standardized maritime measurement for counting cargo containers.</p>
      <p>“With 25% fewer ship calls, 12 consecutive months of declining exports and now decreasing imports, we’re beginning to feel the far-reaching effects of the U.S.-China trade war on American exporters and manufacturers,” Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said.</p>
      <p>The data came amid reports that China and the United States have agreed to roll back tariffs on each others’ goods as part of the first phase of a trade deal.</p>
      <p>“We expect soft volumes in the months ahead and with the holiday season upon us, less cargo means fewer jobs for American workers,” said Seroka, who called for a negotiated settlement to the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing.</p>
