【看懂韓粉4】颱風繞道農產量大　北農獎金發不完創韓總神話
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 王均峰
一位曾任職北農的主管透露：「韓國瑜是天公囝，命太好，他在位那幾年，農產量大，又都拍出高價，錢賺不完。」2014年到2016年之間，有數個「雷聲大雨點小」或突然繞徑而過的颱風，農民趕在颱風來臨前搶收，拍賣市場擠進大量蔬果貨量，加上颱風市場預期心理，這批蔬果全拍出高價。這位主管直言，北農根本沒有績效問題，一切看天吃飯，「北農是抽頭生意，穩賺不賠的，如果量來得大，價格又拍得好，自然就賺得多。」
除了本業之外，台北市政府在韓國瑜任內剛好將青年公園堤外的停車場，劃歸北農管理，這筆「業外收入」每年就高達8、9,000萬元。「這也不是韓國瑜去爭取的，是之前就規劃好的事。」有錢就有資源，這一切正是「北農神話」的根基。
韓國瑜的北農神話到底有多威？「三節獎金、績效獎金各種獎金名目發一發，還發不完，最後額外再給單位主管依據自己評斷再發給下屬員工，結果還是發不完，那時候一個北農員工1年可以分得6個月甚至是雙薪的狀況。」北檢因而介入調查韓國瑜是否濫發獎金，「老實說，他這樣發獎金是有可議之處，但你很難找到任何法條來辦他。」
2016年，民進黨二度重返執政，6月起，民進黨亦將政治之手伸入北農總經理大位佈局。在農委會主委陳吉仲力薦下，作家吳音寧就任。繼任的吳音寧將發放獎金制度化，比照國營企業不得超過本薪4.4個月，該北農前主管說：「所以，下面的人怎會高興，相比之下，他們多愛韓國瑜。」
國民兩黨爭奪北農，與其股份結構有關。北農股權分別有中央、地方政府、民股三個部分，當中央與地方不同政黨執政時，就會發生總經理高層人事問題。韓國瑜任期間，本有2個時機得下台：2014年柯文哲當選台北市長，及2016年蔡英文當選總統。後來被留任，「並不是他多有能力，而是外部權力結構矛盾，大家喬不好人選。」
最後，韓國瑜2017年離開北農，但在市議會中，與嘴尖舌利的市議員王世堅舌戰，王世堅竟佔下風。這則影片高達1,451萬次瀏覽，比蔡依林的MV點閱還高，意外為韓國瑜打開知名度。而繼任者吳音寧在市議會備詢左右見絀的媒體形象，進一步反襯出韓國瑜的幹練。

[Look at Han Powder 4] Typhoon bypasses agricultural production. North Agricultural Awards are not finished.
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Wang Junfeng
A former director of Bei Nong revealed: ""Korean Yu is a good man, and his life is very good. In the years he was in office, the agricultural output was large, and they all shot high prices, and the money could not be earned."" 2014 to 2016 Between the two, there were several typhoons that thundered and thundered, and the peasants rushed to grab the typhoon before the arrival of the typhoon. The auction market squeezed in the volume of fruits and vegetables, plus the expected mentality of the typhoon market. High prices. The supervisor bluntly said that Bei Nong had no performance problems at all, and everything looked at the day. ""Northern farmers are tapping their businesses and making a steady profit. If the volume is large and the price is good, it will naturally earn more.""
In addition to the industry, the Taipei City Government has just placed the parking lot outside the Youth Park embankment in the South Korean Yoga Office, which is equivalent to RMB 80,000 per year. ""This is not what South Korea has to fight for. It is something that has been planned before."" There is money and resources. All this is the foundation of the ""Northern farming myth"".
How strong is the North Nong myth of Korean Yu? ""Three bonuses, performance bonuses, various bonus names will be issued, and they will not be issued. Finally, the directors will be sent to the subordinates based on their own judgments. The results will not be completed. At that time, a North Agricultural employee can get 6 years. Month is even a double-pay situation."" The North Inspection involved in investigating whether South Korea Yu was indiscriminately paying bonuses. ""To be honest, he has a lot to do with bonuses, but it is difficult for you to find any law to handle him.""
In 2016, the DPP returned to power for the second time. From June onwards, the DPP also extended its political hand to the general position of the general manager of Beinong. Under the recommendation of Chen Jizhong, the chairman of the Council of Agriculture, the writer Wu Yining took office. The successor Wu Yining will institutionalize the bonus. The state-owned enterprise must not exceed the salary of 4.4 months. The former North Agricultural Supervisor said: ""So, how can the following people be happy, in contrast, they love Korean Yu.""
The two parties compete for the North Nong, which is related to its share structure. The shares of Beinong are divided into three parts: the central government, the local government, and the private stocks. When the central and local political parties are in power, high-level personnel problems will occur. During the period of South Korea's yoga, there were two opportunities to step down: in 2014, Ke Wenzhe was elected mayor of Taipei, and in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen was elected president. Later, he was retained. ""It is not that he has the ability, but the external power structure is contradictory. Everyone is not a good candidate.""
Finally, South Korea Yu left North Nong in 2017, but in the city council, Wang Shijian, the city councillor with a sharp tongue, fought hard. Wang Shijian actually took the lead. This film has reached 14.51 million views, which is higher than Jolin Tsai's MV. The accident opened the popularity of Korean Yu. The successor, Wu Yining, in the city council to inquire about the media image of seeing you, further reflects the skill of Korean Yu.
