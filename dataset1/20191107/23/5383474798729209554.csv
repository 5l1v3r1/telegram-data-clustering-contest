SMS from the past: right now people are getting messages from Valentine's Day
07 Nov 2019, 23:24 by Artyom Bausov
Something strange is happening right now in the USA. Overnight, many people across the country received messages that were originally sent on Valentine's Day 2019.
Users did not know that their messages did not reach the recipients, so they did not try to resend them.
The problem affected the owners of the iPhone and Android. Now users of almost all American operators are actively complaining: from AT&T and Verizon to T-Mobile and Sprint. As well as customers of small regional companies.
Many users were shocked by the messages they received, as their senders might already have died.



Whose phone has forwarded the message from Valentine's Day?



Who else received the belated message from Valentine's Day?



Which operators do you use? They say t mobile and sprint resent messages from Valentine's Day.
Barbara Call told The Verge that she immediately realized that she had received an old SMS. Her sister wrote that her mother is in a good mood and feels great. Only one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: the woman died in June of this year.
T-Mobile and Sprint claim that the problem arose on the side of a ""third-party service provider."" Now it is already fixed. [The Verge]
