      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/blackfriday2019">Black Friday</a> is still weeks away, but retailers are already trying to pull shoppers into their stores with enticing discounts, and Target's preview is worth checking out for anyone considering a cellphone upgrade. On <a href="https://www.target.com/c/target-black-friday/-/N-5q0f2?lnk=BlackFriday">November 8th and 9th</a>, it will throw a Target gift card in with several smartphones purchased and activated with either Verizon or AT&amp;T. You may be able to find deep discounts via bill credits on activated phones elsewhere, but that's going to be immediately useful for the rest of your holiday shopping.</p>
      <p>The offers include a $200 gift card attached to Apple's <a href="https://weeklyad.target.com/search?code=Target-20191106&amp;lnk=BlackFridaysnea&amp;page=4&amp;keyword=iphone%2011">iPhone 11 / 11 Pro / 11 Pro Max</a>, as well as the older <a href="https://weeklyad.target.com/search?code=Target-20191106&amp;lnk=BlackFridaysnea&amp;page=4&amp;keyword=iphone%20xs">iPhone XS and XS Max</a>, if purchased and activated from Friday through Sunday.</p>
      <p>Prefer Android? There's a $300 gift card waiting for you upon the purchase of a <a href="https://weeklyad.target.com/search?code=Target-20191106&amp;lnk=BlackFridaysnea&amp;page=4&amp;keyword=pixel%204">Google Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL</a>, available now through Sunday.</p>
      <p>Finally, you can get a $400 gift card waiting along with <a href="https://weeklyad.target.com/search?code=Target-20191106&amp;lnk=BlackFridaysnea&amp;page=4&amp;keyword=Samsung%20Galaxy">Samsung's Galaxy S10, S10+ and Note 10+</a>, or $200 if you prefer the cheaper Galaxy S10E, all available from now through Sunday.</p>
