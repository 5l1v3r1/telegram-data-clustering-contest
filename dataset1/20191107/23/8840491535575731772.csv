Peace breaks out in Mayo GAA over confidence vote

07 Nov 2019, 23:54

THE Mayo GAA County Board has issued a brief statement tonight following an emergency meeting of the organisation in Castlebar which lasted over four hours.
The meeting was called to deal with claims by a number of clubs that contrary to a statement issued by the board after last Monday's meeting held in camera, a vote of confidence was not passed in the officer board.
Tonight's statement did not make any reference to the issue or the fact the board has been investigating reports that Monday's meeting was recorded by a person in attendance and circulated.
It stated: ""The meeting discussed a number of topics with a range of views being expressed by all in attendance.
""Following this, all clubs and the board are now looking forward to working together for the betterment of Mayo GAA from now on and in 2020.""
It remains to be seen if clubs abide by a board request not to issue statements on social media in relation to county board business.
This appeal was made after seven clubs challenged a statement issued by the board after Monday's meeting and did so via social media platforms.
The board has been instructed by its legal advisors to refrain from public comment on its widely publicised dispute with the Mayo GAA International Supporters Club which is withholding €250,000, raised at a function in New York last May, due to concerns over governance issues.
