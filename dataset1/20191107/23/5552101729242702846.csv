【看懂韓粉1】在韓國瑜身上找到眷村味　國旗比基尼妹載盲父追星
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 鄭進耀, 賴智揚
11月１日下午，一場由韓粉發起的挺韓大車隊，繞行整個台北市，行經台大門口附近，一群年輕人對車隊比中指、倒讚，車隊裡的人沉默、不做反應。真實世界裡的韓粉多半寡言帶點害羞的特質。網紅四叉貓曾做個一個試驗，在路口若看到數台插著國旗的機車：「我大喊韓國瑜，旁邊那幾個人會莫名激動跟著喊凍蒜！」也有韓粉告訴我，當他在機車上插著國旗，放著愛國歌曲，在市區繞幾回，身後就會有如貪食蛇一般，默默跟上幾台國旗機車。
車隊繞進了軍公教大本營的文山區，那是一段和台大門口全然不同的光景，沿路有人搖國旗、喊加油，車隊裡的人眼神都亮了，像是原本只能對著鏡子跳舞的孤鸞，終於見到世間的同伴，快樂引吭悲鳴。
韓粉是一群壓抑許久，找不到同伴的孤鳥，這一次韓國瑜終於讓他們有聚在一起的理由了。


上週五的挺韓車隊，車隊裡有熱心大叔指揮交通。

類似的狀況也發生在9月8日中午，人潮不斷湧入三重水漾公園，參與國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜的造勢大會。來者有男有女，年紀大多五十歲以上，造勢大會場地多爛泥，他們彼此叮嚀要小心走路，有老人經過，還會同時數人伸手幫忙。
幾位女性在捷運站月台上看見整個公園飄洋的旗海，幾乎眼神帶淚：「好美的國旗！好久沒見到了。」接著便忍不住激動，集體往月台邊衝，掏出手機拚命往公園拍照。他們不顧月台上捷運列車將要通過——韓國瑜就要為中華民國粉身粹骨，他們也要邁開壯烈的腳步。
為了相挺韓國瑜，這些原本平凡得像在捷運上會讓座的路人，會瞬間激動轉為另種人格——有高雄店家因反韓，收到冥紙和各式恐嚇信，最後休業；與蔡英文總統共同網路直播的「貓咪也瘋狂」粉絲頁，也疑因遭韓粉攻擊，暫時下架。最新風波，是政論節目主持人、律師謝震武於節目中飆罵韓國瑜十分鐘。韓粉憤起攻訐，卻搞錯對象，跑到跟他名字相似的藝人謝祖武臉書留言。
韓粉的狂暴行徑，經常被另位總統候選人蔡英文的年輕支持者揶揄：「韓粉出征，笑到往生。」輿論表面看來是中老年與年輕世代的對立，但韓粉的凝聚力，靠得並非年紀。
28歲的章梓薰是韓粉中的年輕面孔。她因多次在韓國瑜的造勢場合上穿國旗比基尼，得到國旗妹稱號。章梓薰出生高雄鳳山眷村，父親眼盲，和母親一起在夜市裡賣青草茶，兄姊則為了謀生，離開台灣工作。

章梓薰小時候曾以父親眼盲為恥，長大發現父親靠一攤涼水攤養活一家人實為不易：「家裡算是過得還不錯，我很感謝爸爸，他現在很依賴我，去哪裡都要我陪，我也很喜歡照顧他。」2000年民進黨執政後，加速推動眷村拆除改建政策。章梓熏從小住居的家在幾年前被拆，此後父親常要她開車，以時速十公里速度載著他，開在在舊時巷弄：「他眼睛看不到，就只是聞著空氣，想像以前眷村的樣子。」
韓國瑜來自眷村，第一次參選便是由與眷村關係密切的黃復興黨部推薦。韓國瑜非將領之後，父親僅是中校退伍，全家住的是一般眷村，他學生時代功課不好，於是只好從軍；父母為了改善經濟，成了地下投資公司的受害者，當年大型的地下投資公司正是以眷村軍公教族群為主要客群之一。這些都是許多眷村韓粉共同的生命經驗。
章梓薰的父執輩在韓國瑜身上看到「同我族類」的認同感。他們因為眷村封閉的環境過著一種與台灣社會半隔離的生活，而章梓薰雖然在在南部長大，「我如果知道對方是民進黨的支持者，我會盡量避免跟他們當朋友。」她甚少關關心政治，政治狂熱對她來說，像是一場晚發的水痘，她從在去年底才開始追著韓國瑜跑。「第一次參與韓國瑜在鳳山的造勢大會，我牽著爸爸到會場。現場人好多，還會主動幫我爸找位子，我被現場的氣氛感動了。」

細看韓粉，除像章梓薰一家對身分認同的站隊，多數韓粉自認是為了下一代而站出來。根據各家民調，韓國瑜的支持者特別在50至60歲這個年齡層，領先其他候選人。53歲、身為壽險業總監總監的王豪餘直言：「為什麼韓國瑜較少年輕人支持？因為年輕人不像我們，見過台灣最美好的時代。」

[Looking at Han Powder 1] Finding the taste of the village in the South Korean Yu.
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Zheng Jinyao, Lai Zhiyang
On the afternoon of November 1, a South Korean team sponsored by Hanbiao, bypassing the entire Taipei city, was passing near the gate of Taida University. A group of young people were more than the middle finger and praised the team, and the people in the team were silent and did not respond. Most of the Korean powder in the real world is shy and shy. The net red four-pronged cat once did a test. If you saw several locomotives with the national flag at the intersection: ""I yelled at South Korea, and the people next to them would be excited to call the frozen garlic!"" Han powder told me. When he inserted the national flag on the locomotive, put a patriotic song, and circled around the city a few times, he would be like a snake in front of him, silently catching up with several flag locomotives.
The team circled into the Wenshan District of the Army's main camp. It was a completely different scene from the entrance of the National Taiwan University. Some people along the road shook the national flag and shouted. The eyes of the team were bright, like the ones who could only dance in the mirror. Hey, finally seeing the companions in the world, happy and sorrowful.
Korean powder is a group of solitary birds that have been suppressed for a long time and cannot find a companion. This time, Korean Yu finally gave them a reason to get together.


Last Friday's pretty Korean team, the team had an enthusiastic uncle to direct traffic.

A similar situation occurred at noon on September 8th, and crowds of people poured into the triple water park, participating in the KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea’s Maoist Conference. There are men and women who come here. Most of them are over 50 years old. The venues of the conference are muddy. They have to walk carefully with each other. When the elderly pass by, several people will reach out and help.
Several women saw the entire flag of the park on the platform of the MRT station, almost tears in their eyes: ""The beautiful flag! I haven't seen it for a long time."" Then I couldn't help but excited, and collectively rushed to the platform. I took a photo of the mobile phone and went to the park. They are going to pass the MRT train on the platform. South Korea’s Yu will be the backbone of the Republic of China, and they will also take a strong footstep.
In order to match South Korea's Yu, these ordinary passers-by will be like a passer-by on the MRT, and will be instantly excited to become a different personality - there are Kaohsiung stores because of anti-Korean, received a paper and all kinds of threatening letters, and finally closed; The ""Cat is crazy"" fan page, which was broadcast live with President Tsai Ing-wen, was also suspected of being attacked by Han powder and temporarily removed. The latest turmoil is that the political commentary host and lawyer Xie Zhenwu has ten minutes of Korean Yu in the program. Han Fan became angry and attacked, but he made a mistake and went to the Xie Zuwu face-book with his similar name.
Han Fan’s violent behavior is often criticized by the young supporter of another presidential candidate, Tsai Ing-wen: “Han-Han’s expedition, laughing to the future.” The public opinion seems to be the opposition between the middle-aged and the younger generation, but the cohesiveness of the Korean powder, It is not old.
The 28-year-old Zhang Yuxun is a young face in Korean powder. She has won the national flag sister title for wearing a national flag bikini on several occasions in Korea. Zhang Yuxun was born in Fengshan Village, Kaohsiung. His father was blind. He sold his herbal tea in the night market with his mother. The brother-in-law went to work in Taiwan to make a living.


In the occasion of the occasion, because of wearing the national flag bikini, Zhang Yuxun got the title of the flag girl. (Reflected from Zhang Yuxun Fan Group)

When Zhang Xiaoxun was a child, he was ashamed of his father's blindness. When he grew up, he found that it was not easy for his father to support a family by a cold water. ""The family is a good day. I am very grateful to my father. He is very dependent on me now. I also like to take care of him."" After the DPP came to power in 2000, it accelerated the policy of demolition and reconstruction of the village. Zhang Yu smoked his family from a small residence. He was demolished a few years ago. After that, his father often asked her to drive. He was carrying him at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour. He opened the old lane and said: ""He can’t see his eyes, just smell the air, imagine before. The look of the village.""
South Korea’s Yu is from the village, and the first election is recommended by the Huang Fu Party, which has close ties with the village. After the Korean non-general general, the father was only a veteran of the middle school, and the whole family lived in the general village. His student time was not good, so he had to go to the army. In order to improve the economy, the parents became the victims of the underground investment company. The investment company is one of the main customers of the village. These are the common life experiences of many Yucun Han powder.
The father of Zhang Yuxun saw the identity of ""with my family"" in Korean Yu. Because of the closed environment of the village, they lived a life that was semi-segregated from Taiwanese society. Although Zhang Yuxun grew up in the south, ""I will try to avoid being friends with them if I know that the other party is a supporter of the DPP."" Very little concern about politics, political enthusiasm for her, like a late chickenpox, she began to chase the South Korean yoga run at the end of last year. ""For the first time to participate in the Korean Yoga exhibition in Fengshan, I took my father to the venue. There were a lot of people on the scene, and I would take the initiative to help my dad find a seat. I was touched by the atmosphere of the scene.""

Looking closely at the Korean powder, except for the team that is recognized by the identity of Zhang Yuxun, most of the Korean powder believes that it is standing for the next generation. According to various polls, Korean Yu's supporters are particularly leading the other candidates in the age group of 50 to 60 years old. Wang Haoyu, 53, who is the director of life insurance industry, said bluntly: ""Why is South Korea less supportive of young people? Because young people are not like us, they have seen the best times in Taiwan.""
