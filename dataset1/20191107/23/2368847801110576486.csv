中國頻爆債務違約 或成明年最大「黑天鵝」

07 Nov 2019, 23:01

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月08日訊】中國經濟加速下行，近來多家知名企業資金鏈也陷入困境，出現債務違約。民企之間經常交叉擔保，一家違約會引發連鎖效應。有港媒稱，明年將是中國企業巨額還債高峰期，債務違約或成中國經濟最大的「黑天鵝」。
彭博社引述數據報導，截至10月18日，中國今年違約的債券已達120家，違約本金合計1,029億元（人民幣，下同）。安永會計師事務所估計，到今年年底，中國累計違約金額將超過去年，創下1,220億元歷史新高。
其中，民企經濟發達的江浙地區，今年違約特別嚴重，排在全國前列。官方統計，今年前三季度債務違約接近800億，按年增加36%。但市場人士認為，官方統計數據遠低於實際規模，因為有更多違約糾紛沒有通過官方，是在地下管道協商解決。
近期一些知名企業也加入債務違約大軍。重要製鋼企業山東西王集團，10月底出現10億債務違約。而標準普爾指出，山東民企流行交叉擔保，一家大企業資金出問題，很容易導致連鎖崩盤的骨牌效應。
就連知名科技國企也爆發債務危機，包括清華大學控股的紫光集團、北京大學控股的方正集團，近期也出現美元債暴跌，危機空前。
港媒指，中國企業債務違約頻發，主要原因是經濟下行導致企業經營困難，沒有足夠的資金回籠還債。另外，當局此前「一刀切的去槓桿」，民企借貸困難，近兩年央行大舉放水又流不到民企手中。再一個是「國進民退」的政治風向令民企卻步，不斷縮小經濟規模。
2014至2016年中共央行大放水推高負債，所以2018至2020年成為中國的還債高峰期。明年更有巨額債務到期，如果經濟繼續下行，可能引發債務連鎖爆雷，導致經濟危機。
除了企業負債，中共政府債務和中國家庭債務也不斷攀升。國際金融協會（IIF）報告指，早在今年第一季度，中國企業、家庭和政府的債務總規模已升至40萬億美元，相當於GDP的303%，約占全球債務的15%。
中共全國人大財經委副主任委員賀鏗去年5月曾在北京透露，中國的地方債總額已達到40萬億元，但地方政府沒有一個想還債，許多地方連利息都還不起。榮鼎集團（Rhodium）早前報告指，今年前4個月大陸就已有13個地方政府融資平台債務違約，但多數違約案件都未申報。
日前，被指中共高層智囊的經濟學家魏傑也發出警告稱，明年中國經濟下行壓力還是很大，同時也將面臨還債高峰期，必須保障資金供應正常，否則將會發生大量的債務危機，發展到一定程度就會導致金融危機。
中共當局也頗為緊張，國務院副總理劉鶴10月21日出席會議中表示，政府及國企清償民企債務的工作「問題不少」，要求今年之內儘快還債。
與此同時，美中貿易戰仍在繼續，中國經濟還在加速下行。中共當局宣稱第三季度GDP增速為6%，但該數據連中共體制內學者都公開質疑，美國總統川普（特朗普）更表示，中國實際GDP增速是負數。而中共一家智庫指出，今年下半年美國加徵關稅的效果還沒有完全顯現，明年中國經濟形勢將更為嚴峻。

China's frequent debt default or become the biggest ""black swan"" next year

07 Nov 2019, 23:01

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 08, 2019] China's economy has accelerated its downward trend. Recently, a number of well-known corporate capital chains have also been in trouble and debt defaults have occurred. There is often cross-guarantee between private enterprises, and a default will trigger a chain effect. Some Hong Kong media said that next year will be the peak period for Chinese companies to pay heavily, and debt defaults may become the biggest ""black swan"" in China's economy.
Bloomberg quoted data reports that as of October 18, China had defaulted on 120 bonds this year, with a total default of 102.9 billion yuan (RMB, the same below). Ernst & Young has estimated that by the end of this year, China’s cumulative default will exceed last year, setting a record high of $122 billion.
Among them, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions with developed economies in private enterprises are particularly serious in default this year, ranking first in the country. According to official statistics, the debt default in the first three quarters of this year was close to 80 billion, an increase of 36% year-on-year. However, market participants believe that the official statistics are far below the actual scale, because more default disputes have not passed the official, and they are negotiated in the underground pipeline.
Recently, some well-known companies have also joined the debt default army. The important east-west Wangshan Group, a steel-making enterprise, had a default of 1 billion debts at the end of October. Standard & Poor's pointed out that the popular cross-guarantee of private enterprises in Shandong, a problem with a large enterprise, can easily lead to the domino effect of the chain collapse.
Even the well-known technology state-owned enterprises have also experienced debt crisis, including the Ziguang Group, controlled by Tsinghua University, and the Founder Group, which is controlled by Peking University. Recently, the US dollar debt has plummeted, and the crisis is unprecedented.
According to the Hong Kong media, Chinese enterprises have defaulted on debts. The main reason is that the economic downturn has led to difficulties in business operations and insufficient funds have been returned to pay debts. In addition, the authorities had previously ""one-size-fits-all-leveraging"", and private enterprises were having difficulty borrowing money. In the past two years, the central bank’s massive release of water has not flowed to the hands of private enterprises. Another is that the political trend of ""national advancement and retreat"" has deterred private enterprises and has continuously reduced the scale of the economy.
From 2014 to 2016, the central bank of the Chinese Communist Party has pushed up its debts, so it will become China's debt repayment period from 2018 to 2020. Next year, there will be a huge debt maturity. If the economy continues to decline, it may trigger a debt chain explosion, which will lead to an economic crisis.
In addition to corporate liabilities, CCP government debt and Chinese household debt are also rising. According to the International Finance Association (IIF), as early as the first quarter of this year, the total debt of Chinese companies, households and governments has risen to 40 trillion US dollars, equivalent to 303% of GDP, accounting for about 15% of global debt.
He Wei, deputy director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the National People's Congress of China, revealed in Beijing last May that China's total local debt has reached 40 trillion yuan, but no local government wants to pay off debts. Many places cannot even afford interest. Rhodium Group reported earlier that in the first four months of this year, 13 local government financing platforms had defaulted on debts, but most of the default cases were not declared.
A few days ago, Wei Jie, an economist accused of the CCP’s high-level think tank, also warned that China’s economic downturn will be very strong next year. At the same time, it will also face the peak of debt repayment. It must protect the normal supply of funds, otherwise a large debt crisis will occur. To a certain extent, it will lead to a financial crisis.
The Chinese Communist Party is also quite nervous. Vice Premier Liu He attended the meeting on October 21 and said that the government and state-owned enterprises have ""a lot of problems"" in repaying the debts of private enterprises, and they are required to pay their debts as soon as possible within this year.
At the same time, the US-China trade war is still continuing and the Chinese economy is still accelerating. The Chinese authorities claimed that the third quarter GDP growth rate was 6%, but the data was even openly questioned by scholars within the CCP system. US President Trump (Trump) also said that China's real GDP growth rate is negative. The CCP’s think tank pointed out that the effect of the US tariff increase in the second half of this year has not yet fully manifested, and China’s economic situation will be more severe next year.
