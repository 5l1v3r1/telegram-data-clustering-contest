      <p>Juul Labs Inc. was sued for collecting biometric data from its online customers as a method of verifying they are legally old enough to buy vaping products.</p>
      <p>The company was accused in a complaint filed Thursday in Illinois of violating a state law that requires consumer consent for companies to gather sensitive biometric data.</p>
      <p>WeWork was hit this week with a similar class-action complaint over its alleged used of facial scans to track people in its shared office spaces without informed written consent, which plaintiffs claim is a violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act.</p>
