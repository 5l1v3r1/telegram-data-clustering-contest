英前下議院議長：脫歐是二戰後最錯誤外交政策

（中央社記者戴雅真倫敦7日專電）請辭後的英國前下議院議長貝爾考（John Bercow）終於可以說出真心話。他表示，脫歐是英國在第二次世界大戰之後，做過最錯誤的外交政治決策。
下議院的議長制度可追溯至1377年，在18、19世紀演變出議長必須保持中立的規矩。56歲的貝爾考從2009年起出任議長。他之前是保守黨議員，但當選議長後必須脫離黨派，維持中立。
不過，貝爾考在脫歐過程中的許多抉擇被認為偏頗、傾向留歐派，引發脫歐派激烈質疑。他在10月31日請辭。下議院4日選出工黨籍議員霍伊爾（Lindsay Hoyle）為下議院新任議長。
貝爾考昨天在倫敦的外籍記者協會表示，卸下10年的下議院院長職務後，他終於不必「保持中立」，可以抒發己見。
但他也表示，他在擔任議長時，「一直都公平對待」各方議員，無論是脫歐派或留歐派。
被問到他是否認為脫歐對英國的國際地位有益處，貝爾考表示：「老實說，答案是沒有。」
他說：「我認為脫歐是二戰之後最錯誤的外交政策，這是我真實的想法。」
貝爾考也說，他幾乎可以肯定，國會即使沒有拖上15年，至少接下來5年還會持續辯論脫歐。（編輯：周永捷）1081107

Former British House of Commons Speaker: Brexit is the most wrong foreign policy after World War II
07 Nov 2019, 23:08 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Dai Yazhen, London 7th special) After the resignation, the former British House of Commons Speaker John Bercow can finally tell the truth. He said that Brexit was the most wrong diplomatic and political decision made by the United Kingdom after the Second World War.
The Speaker's system of the House of Commons dates back to 1377, and in the 18th and 19th centuries it evolved that the Speaker must maintain a neutral rule. The 56-year-old Belkau has been the speaker since 2009. He used to be a Conservative Party member, but he must be separated from the party and remain neutral after being elected as Speaker.
However, many of Belk's choices in the process of Brexit were considered biased and tend to stay in Europe, causing fierce doubts from the Brexit. He resigned on October 31. On the 4th, the House of Commons elected Labour Party member Lindsay Hoyle as the new Speaker of the House of Commons.
Belkau’s Foreign Correspondents Association in London yesterday said that after dismissing the position of Dean of the House of Commons for 10 years, he finally did not have to “keep neutral” and could express his opinion.
However, he also said that when he was the speaker, he ""always treated all parties"" fairly, whether it was the Brexit or the Europeans.
Asked if he thinks Brexit is good for Britain's international status, Belk said: ""To be honest, the answer is no.""
He said: ""I think Brexit is the most wrong foreign policy after World War II. This is my real idea.""
Belkau also said that he is almost certain that Congress will continue to debate Brexit for at least the next five years, even if it has not been dragged on for 15 years. (Editor: Zhou Yongjie) 1081107
