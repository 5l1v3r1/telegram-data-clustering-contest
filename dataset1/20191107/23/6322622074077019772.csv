KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Global passenger traffic results for September 2019 showing that demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) climbed 3.8% compared to the same month last year, broadly unchanged from August’s performance, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
In a statement Nov 7, IATA said capacity (available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased by 3.3%, and load factor climbed 0.4% percentage point to 81.9%, which was a record for any September.
IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said September marked the eighth consecutive month of below average demand growth.
“Given the environment of declining world trade activity and tariff wars, rising political and geopolitical tensions and a slowing global economy, it is difficult to see the trend reversing in the near term,” he said.
