07 Nov 2019, 23:42 by WABC



NEW YORK (WABC) -- By daybreak on Friday, temperatures will plummet and the added wind chill will make it feel like 25 degrees in Central Park and even colder to the north and west.
A fast-moving system will bring some light snow to higher elevations overnight, but for most of us, the story is the arrival of the coldest air of the season.
As the cold air arrives on the backside of the front, some snow can be expected in the Poconos and Catskills.



Some northern communities could also see some mixing or even flurries.
Friday will be an AccuWeather Alert day because of the cold and blustery conditions.
High temperatures might not break the 40 degree mark in some places. Wind chills will keep it feeling like the 20s and teens.
