Trays were sent flying at a Popeyes restaurant in San Antonio on Tuesday during a fight between a customer and an employee.
The two unidentified women are seen throwing food trays at each other in a dispute caught on video and posted on Twitter.
The woman who filmed the altercation said she was in line to pick up some of Popeyes’ popular chicken sandwiches when a woman who she believes was initially in the drive-thru line came in through a side door.
