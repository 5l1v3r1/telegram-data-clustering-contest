      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - W Series champion Jamie Chadwick has taken a step closer to Formula One this year but her dream of one day competing at the pinnacle of motor racing feels further away than ever.</p>

      <p>The Briton, who collected $500,000 for winning the inaugural all-female single-seater title, celebrated her 21st birthday in May with a new role as development driver for the Williams F1 team.</p>
      <p>She is also one of four finalists for the BRDC Young Driver of the Year award, which is co-sponsored by Red Bull’s title partners Aston Martin and whose main prize is a Formula One test.</p>
      <p>The experience of being on the inside of the grand prix paddock has made her realize just how much more she has to do, however.</p>
      <p>Asked whether she felt closer to becoming the first female Formula One driver since 1976, she replied: “To be completely honest, further away.</p>
      <p>“Not in a bad way, in a really refreshing way, I feel I know what I need to now learn in the next few years. I’m not going to rush that. I’m not going to try and cheat it,” Chadwick added.</p>
      <p>Those who enquire on social media whether she might replace departing Williams driver Robert Kubica were living in a fantasy world, not only because Chadwick lacks a super license but also because she is nowhere near ready.</p>
      <p>Her world is very different to that of Mercedes’ six times world champion Lewis Hamilton, an admired compatriot she has yet to meet.</p>
      <p>“I need the time to develop and if I get to Formula One I want to be the best possible driver to make the mark I need to make,” said Chadwick.</p>
      <h3>DIRECT CORRELATION</h3>
      <p>While the Williams role has been mostly simulator-based, her work has a direct correlation to what happens at the track.</p>
      <p>Williams previously had Susie Wolff, now retired and a team principal in the all-electric Formula E series, in a similar role and gave the Scot track time in some Friday practice sessions.</p>
      <p>Chadwick indicated she would be pushing for such an opportunity.</p>
      <p>“In terms of getting in the car, that’s an ongoing discussion. We’re sort of pushing as hard as we can but we’ll see,” she said.</p>
      <p>“If we can continue the relationship into next year, and if I can continue to do the best possible job in the sim, then that hopefully gives me justifiable reason to potentially test the car at a future date.”</p>

      <p>Chadwick will be back to defend her W Series title next year, hoping to then join the men climbing the motorsport ladder.</p>
      <p>“At the moment although the first year and the exposure has been absolutely incredible, I haven’t quite managed to secure the (financial) support to go to, say, FIA F3,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully off the back of a strong second year’s campaign... that’s going to give me that opportunity.”</p>
