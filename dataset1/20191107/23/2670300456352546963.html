      <h1>Lauren Duca on Trump’s gaslighting, her new book, online bullies, and coming out gay (Part 1)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T23:32:55+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 23:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://americablog.com/author/john-aravosis" target="_blank">John Aravosis</a></address>
      <p>We had a gangbusters interview with journalist, feminist and political columnist Lauren Duca today, that went nearly two hours! I’ve broken the interview into two parts for that reason. This is part 1.</p>
      <p>We talk with Lauren about her new book, “How to Start a Revolution: Young People and the Future of American Politics”; about Fox News’ toxic impact on our culture, about Trump’s ongoing gaslighting, about online bullies and purity politics, and about the news that Lauren came out this year, and how that self-discovery was intimately tied with her political awakening. She’s a really interesting woman. I think you’ll like this.</p>
