      <p>SASKATOON -- Calvin Bruneau found an unexpected visitor while unpacking his groceries after a Costco shopping trip on Saturday.</p>
      <p>While emptying a cardboard box he used to bring groceries home from the Marquis Drive Costco, Bruneau believes he spotted a black spider lurking inside.</p>
      <p>“I asked my son to keep an eye on it while I grabbed a container because I could tell right off the bat that it wasn't a regular spider that you would typically see around here,” Bruneau said.</p>
      <p>Upon closer inspection, Bruneau recognized a red spot on the spider's stomach, the signature of a black widow. The venomous spider is uncommon in western Canada.</p>
      <p>"If the spider would have got out and bit someone, the person would be sick and you wouldn't know to think that it would be from a poisonous spider."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Remain calm</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/pest-control-tips/spiders.html">Health Canada</a>, black widow bites rarely result in serious long-term complications or death. </p>
      <p>If a person is bitten one of the spiders, their reaction depends on where the bite occurs and their sensitivity to the venom. Also, the amount of venom injected is a factor.</p>
      <p>While Health Canada suggests anyone bitten by a black widow should remain calm, it is recommended they seek medical attention.</p>
      <p>One expert believes the spider did not come from somewhere in Saskatchewan, but rather from a warmer climate.</p>
      <p>“Given that it’s kind of cold out now, I would say that it came from California,” said Felix Sperling, Univesity of Alberta biological sciences professor.</p>

      <p>Bruneau said he did notice the box used to pack his groceries was from Grape Man Farms, a California-based company.</p>
      <p>Costco foods and Grape Man Farms have not yet returned CTV News Saskatoon's requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Bruneau said he doesn't blame Costo for the incident.</p>
      <p>"It's not going to change how we shop or what we buy from there," Bruneau said. "This could have happened anywhere."</p>
      <p>As for the black widow, it's now in the care of a "spider enthusiast" in Saskatoon, Bruneau said.</p>
