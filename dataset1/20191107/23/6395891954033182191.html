      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Progressives in Rhode Island have unveiled a plan to power a town with only renewable energy.</p>
      <p>The proposal announced Wednesday by the Rhode Island Progressive Democrats of America is the first part of a larger goal to "fight the climate crisis" and meet all the state's energy needs with solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage facilities by 2030.</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports the goal of the blueprint is to find ways to generate an excess of renewable energy that a public utility could sell out of state and the profits would be channeled back to state residents.</p>
      <p>The goal is for the city of Cranston to be powered with a combination of sources.</p>
      <p>The group has hired a joint venture of consulting firms for $26,000 to develop the plan.</p>
