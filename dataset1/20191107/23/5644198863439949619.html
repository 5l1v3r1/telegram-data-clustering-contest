      <p>World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) President-elect Witold Banka pledged on Thursday to be tough on Russia if the country is proven to have manipulated the doping data of its athletes.</p>
      <p>KATOWICE, Poland: World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) President-elect Witold Banka pledged on Thursday to be tough on Russia if the country is proven to have manipulated the doping data of its athletes.</p>
      <p>The Polish Tourism and Sports Minister, who was officially appointed as the next WADA president on Thursday, will take over his post on Jan. 1.</p>

      <p>"I start my term of office next year. I am waiting for the results of the analyses. If we discover some manipulations the reaction should be tough," Banka told a news conference.</p>
      <p>For more than four years Russia has been the focus of several investigations and sanctions after a 2015 WADA-commissioned report highlighted a vast doping network in the country's sports community.</p>
      <p>Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA was suspended after a 2015 WADA report which found vast evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics. The country has since struggled to restore its international credibility in sport.</p>
      <p>RUSADA’s suspension was lifted in September 2018 amid strong criticism as WADA gradually obtained access to key Russian athletes’ data from the Russian lab.</p>
      <p>But WADA opened compliance proceedings again in September after finding inconsistencies in the vast bank of historical testing data finally handed over in January.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Banka, a former track and field athlete who will succeed Craig Reedie, was the public authorities' choice for WADA president, as the post rotates between a choice from sports bodies and one from public authorities.</p>
      <p>Banka, whose appointment was rubber-stamped by the body's Foundation Board on the final day of the world conference on doping in sport, has also pledged to set up a doping fund for corporate sponsors to contribute towards clean sport.</p>
      <p>"We have the same objective and goals in our hearts, to clean up sport and create a fair environment," Banka said in a brief address after a unanimous election.</p>
      <p>"I promise you to try to always build bridges with all stakeholders. I am sure together we will make anti-doping systems stronger."</p>
      <p>WADA also approved a revision of its World Anti-Doping Code which will come into force on Jan. 1, 2021 after a two-year consultation process.</p>
      <p>Among the changes are considerably lower sanctions for the use of illicit drugs taken not to enhance performances but for recreational purposes, such as marijuana and cocaine.</p>
      <p>Athletes will be banned for weeks instead of years for such an anti-doping rule violation if they can establish that the use of such banned substances was unrelated to their sport performance.</p>
      <p>Successful completion of a rehab treatment programme can further reduce the suspension.</p>
