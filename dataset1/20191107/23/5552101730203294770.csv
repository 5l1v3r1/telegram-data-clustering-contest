【看懂韓粉3】韓國瑜的魯蛇經驗　從國民黨邊緣人成黨的救星
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鄭進耀, 陳毅偉, 林俊耀
王豪餘和劉輝政的人生跟著台灣政經環境轉變而起伏，韓國瑜的政治之路也鑲崁在這幾年深具台灣特色的民主化過程裡。在論資排輩，講求歷練資格的國民黨人才梯隊裡，韓國瑜出身背景一般，雖為官校畢業，但念的非正統官科而僅是專修班，這樣一個不起眼的人，卻在90年代一路竄起。
他開始受到注目是初任台北縣市議員時，與當時的縣長尤清拍桌叫罵，最後還向尤清砸了水杯。在那個只有民進黨會在議會裡打架的年代，國民黨缺乏這種「衝組」。當年國民黨內部就有這樣的說法：「你難道要叫大學畢業的政務官跳到台上打人嗎？連官科畢業的軍官都不適合，也只有韓國瑜這樣的人才可以」。
敢衝的韓國瑜在台北縣議員任期還沒結束就投入立委選舉，1993年當選第一次國會改選後的立法委員，之後又再連任二次，不到35歲就在政壇一飛衝天。國民黨立種在議會裡打人打到出名的，除了羅福助大概就是韓國瑜了。他十分明白，機會來了就要捉住，不管有沒有準備好，先衝再說。當年如此，現在更是。
隨著選制改變，與權力的更迭，韓國瑜沒搭上時代的變化，2001年，他被排在國民黨安全名單外，首度選舉失利。2006年，受邀擔任中和市副市長，並於2007年盤算再戰立委。不過，因攻訐同選區參選人李慶華與張慶忠，而被取消參選資格。
這些個人仕途的挫敗並不是壞事，之後全被韓國瑜轉化成「庶民翻身」的勵志故事，並進一步與民間底層的不滿，結合成一個「我和你一樣都被這個國家欺負」的「怨氣共同體」。把「莫忘世上苦人多」列為政見，看似不知所云卻深深打動韓粉們，時時掛在嘴邊。


對許多國民黨的支持者來說，韓國瑜是讓他們再度一起站出來的理由。

然而，這又絕非是一個簡單的庶民故事。
無論高雄市長選舉，或總統選戰，韓國瑜身旁總會跟著他的妻子，李佳芬。李佳芬出身雲林縣西螺鎮福佬客籍政治世家，父親李日貴早年於濁水溪畔經營砂石業，也曾擔任三屆雲林縣議員，更重要的是，與曾擔任雲林縣長的張榮味往來密切。張榮味除是雲林地方派系張派要角，長年來，更掌握台灣農會體系。
台灣農會前身為農民組合，國民政府來台後，為安定農村，進行改組，此後農會、漁會與農田水利會，成為政治治理的重要基礎。1975年至1991年間幾次與農會相關的修訂法案，如農會總幹事由主管機關遴選，更使農會被政治深深介入。國民黨長期執政期間，還進一步安排農會管理者參選地方政治，由於農會同時握有放款金脈，長年下來，使農會成為各級選舉重要的動員機器。
韓國瑜擔任中和市副市長期間，曾與中華民國農會總幹事、張榮味妹婿張永成接洽處理事務，加上岳家關係，於2012年前台北市長郝龍斌執政期間，被推派為台北農產運銷公司總經理。並無農業或管理專業背景的韓國瑜，於在任期間，立下「北農神話」，這段經歷，及其後民進黨為打破張榮味勢力的北農總經理爭奪戰，意外將韓國瑜拱成政治新星。

[See Han Powder 3] Korean Yu's Lu Snake Experience From the Kuomintang Marginal Party to the Party's Savior
07 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Zheng Jinyao, Chen Yiwei, Lin Junyao
The life of Wang Haoyu and Liu Huizheng has followed the ups and downs of Taiwan's political and economic environment. The political road of South Korea's Yu is also embedded in the process of democratization with Taiwan characteristics in recent years. In the seniority of the Kuomintang talents, which is highly qualified, the Korean youth has a background in general. Although he graduated from the official school, he is only a non-orthodox official and only a special class. Such an inconspicuous person has been in the 1990s. Start.
He began to receive attention when he was the first member of the Taipei County Council. He and the then county magistrate, You Qing screamed at the table, and finally smashed the cup to You Qing. In the era when only the DPP would fight in the parliament, the Kuomintang lacked such a ""group."" In the same year, the Kuomintang said: ""Do you want to call the university administrator to jump on the stage to beat people? Even the officers who graduated from the official department are not suitable, and only the talents such as South Korea Yu can.""
The dare-stricken Korean Yu was placed in the legislature elections before the end of his term in Taipei County. In 1993, he was elected as the legislator after the first congressional election, and then re-elected twice. He was in the political arena when he was less than 35 years old. The Kuomintang established a famous name in the parliament, except for Luo Fuzhu, which is probably Korean. He knows very well that if the opportunity comes, he will catch it. Whether he is ready or not, he will say it first. That was the case, and now it is even more.
With the change of the system of choice and the change of power, South Korea’s Yu did not catch up with the changes of the times. In 2001, he was ranked outside the KMT’s safe list and lost his first election. In 2006, he was invited to serve as deputy mayor of Zhonghe City, and in 2007, he decided to fight for the legislator. However, he was disqualified from the election because of the attack on Li Qinghua and Zhang Qingzhong.
The frustration of these personal careers is not a bad thing. After that, it was turned into a motivational story of ""Yu people turning over"" and further combined with the dissatisfaction of the bottom of the people into a ""rebel community that I am being bullied by this country like you."" ""."" As a political opinion, ""I don't forget many people in the world"", it seems that I don't know what it is, but I am deeply impressed by the Korean powder, and I always hang on my lips.


For many KMT supporters, South Korea is the reason for them to stand up again.

However, this is by no means a simple untouchable story.
Regardless of the Kaohsiung mayoral election or the presidential election, South Korea’s Yu will always follow his wife, Li Jiafen. Li Jiafen was born in the Weilu guest political family in Xiluo Town, Yunlin County. His father Li Rigui operated the sandstone industry in the early years of the Zhuoshui River. He also served as a member of the 3rd Yunlin County Council. More importantly, he was the former Zhang Yunwei of Yunlin County. Close contacts. In addition to the Zhang faction of the local faction of Yunlin, Zhang Rongwei has mastered the Taiwan Agricultural Association system for many years.
The Taiwan Farmers Association was formerly a peasant group. After the National Government came to Taiwan, it was reorganized for the stability of the countryside. Since then, the peasant associations, fisheries and farmland water conservancy have become an important basis for political governance. Several amendments related to the peasant association between 1975 and 1991, such as the selection of the director general of the peasant association, made the peasant association deeply involved in politics. During the long-term administration of the Kuomintang, the peasant associations were further arranged to participate in local politics. Since the peasant associations also held the money for lending, the peasant associations became an important mobilization machine for elections at all levels.
During his tenure as deputy mayor of Zhonghe City, South Korea Yu was contacted by the Director General of the Republic of China Agricultural Association and Zhang Rongwei, Zhang Yongcheng, and the relationship between Yue Jia and Yue Jia, who was promoted to Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Company during the 2012 Taipei Mayor Hao Longbin. General manager. Korean Yu, who has no background in agriculture or management, set up the ""Northern Farming Myth"" during his tenure, and this experience, and the Democratic Progressive Party’s fight for the defeat of Zhang Rongwei’s general manager of the North Agriculture, unexpectedly turned Korean Yu into politics. New star.
