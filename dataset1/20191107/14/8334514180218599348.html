      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s sports minister said on Thursday that concerns raised over a vast bank of Russian doping data being scrutinized for possible abuses were of a purely technical nature and that the data had not been tampered with.</p>
      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has said it identified inconsistencies in laboratory data provided by Moscow earlier this year, potentially jeopardizing the country’s participation in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>“Nothing was deleted... This is a purely technical question linked to the way the system’s work is organized,” Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said.</p>
      <p>Kolobkov’s comments came after Yuri Ganus, the head of Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, said the data handed to WADA had been manipulated.</p>
      <p>“There were no so-called manipulations as comrade Ganus says. What’s more, this word doesn’t feature anywhere and doesn’t appear in any WADA document,” Kolobkov said.</p>
      <p>Russia was barred from the Pyongchang Winter Games last year as punishment for alleged state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, although some Russians with no history of doping were cleared to compete as neutrals.</p>
      <p>The Russian Olympic Committee said in September that the country could miss the Tokyo Games if Moscow failed to explain why the data was inconsistent.</p>
