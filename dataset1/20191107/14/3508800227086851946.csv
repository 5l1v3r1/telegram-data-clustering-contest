粉絲俱樂部的行銷魔力

案例一：和路雪的選秀行銷

《超級女聲》的熱烈光芒開啟了選秀時代，《快樂男聲》、《我型我秀》、《星光大道》等選秀節目層出不窮，隨之粉絲俱樂部紛紛成立，成為企業推動粉絲經濟的主體對象。
2008年3月，和路雪（冰淇淋品牌）聯手粉絲網舉辦了一個網路歌唱比賽，面向全國網友開放，只要上傳自己的歌唱影片就可參賽，由林俊傑和金莎等組成的明星評審團和網路投票結果決定勝負，最終獲勝者將可能與海蝶唱片簽約，與青春偶像林俊傑、金莎成為同門。在投票環節，一個和路雪可愛多霜淇淋可以兌換一個投票代碼，相當於100張網路投票，一個超級可愛多的代碼則相當於200倍的網路投票。
每個人都渴望出名，和路雪推出的這個活動給了很多人希望，而明星評審團也在一定程度上滿足了粉絲們追星的欲望，因而這個活動受到了市場的熱烈回應，最終吸引了超過1萬5000名參賽者，網路瀏覽量超過6000萬人次，與此同時，和路雪可愛多霜淇淋銷量大增。

案例二：曼陀珠的創意粉絲行銷

作為糖果業的天之驕子，專門經營各種糖果和膠姆糖的不凡帝范梅勒集團（Perfetti Van Melle S.P.A）擁有數十個品牌、近百個產品，而曼陀珠就是其子產品之一。
曼陀珠以其外脆內軟的獨特口感和珍珠般的外形而享譽全球100多個國家，它的廣告非常注重創意，比如透過手的影子把桌上的曼陀珠糖送入朋友口中，在懸崖上垂直倒立的攀登者還能騰出手來享受曼陀珠的美味。
由於主要針對年輕群體，所以曼陀珠非常注重網路傳播，不但品牌有專屬網站，還在粉絲網擁有自己的品牌專區，比如粉絲們可以在論壇上討論曼陀珠廣告是如何拍成的，也可自己創造神奇的幻覺作品，由網路投票選出優勝者，優勝者可以得到非常豐厚的獎品。
曼陀珠的網路行銷很得人心，其粉絲團人數已超過5萬，論壇訪問量更是超過700萬人次。在年輕人心中，曼陀珠在其獨特創意下傳達的趣味文化「真的很曼陀珠」，具有非凡的魅力。

案例三：樂高等品牌的粉絲參與行銷

與曼陀珠類似，已發展了80年的玩具品牌樂高也十分注意粉絲中的創意行銷，樂高鼓勵粉絲們在樂高社區中分享自己的創意玩法。這種簡單的拼插、搭扣玩具風靡全球已經幾十年，樂高社區的創意分享功不可沒。具有200年歷史的牙膏品牌高露潔則鼓勵粉絲們自行創作牙膏廣告，此舉因為滿足了粉絲表現的欲望，進而獲得了極高的參與度。百事可樂也透過「燃情麥克風」、「美麗髮色我來秀」等活動都開展了轟轟烈烈的粉絲行銷，效果不凡。
這些粉絲行銷，透過粉絲們的互動參與，使得品牌一傳十、十傳百口口相傳，得到了裂變式的傳播效果。
粉絲行銷如何持續有效
由以上案例，我們可以看到粉絲行銷的強大，既然粉絲行銷效果如此之好，投入相比傳統行銷幾可忽略，那麼為什麼沒有推廣到各行各業，甚至許多強勢的品牌根本就沒有粉絲。粉絲行銷真的如看起來這樣簡單而有效嗎，如何避免粉絲的負面傳播，粉絲行銷如何持續？這些都是做粉絲行銷之前應該搞清楚的問題。
首先，適不適合做粉絲行銷，品牌首先要考慮清楚以下問題：

品牌的客戶是哪個階層，他們之間有多少有品牌意識？
品牌有沒有粉絲群，他們有多少品牌忠誠度？
吸引消費者的購買行為是基於廣告、活動還是產品本身？
搞清楚了以上問題，企業再來思考以何種方式行銷。
粉絲行銷表達的內涵是否和品牌文化匹配？
行銷活動能否促進銷量增長？
如何保證粉絲傳播正面資訊？

所有問題全部清晰，品牌商就可以開展粉絲行銷了。而粉絲行銷的重要步驟，就是在粉絲俱樂部內開展互動活動。如何把參與俱樂部的活動變成粉絲生活的一部分，是粉絲行銷的成敗關鍵。比如寫博客、貼靚照比賽，讓粉絲分享自己跟產品有關的生活故事，吸引更多的粉絲參與討論等，都是確實可行的行銷手段。在這個過程中，需要一個有影響力的俱樂部領袖，作為品牌與粉絲之間的互動橋樑，引導粉絲團的發言和互動，對粉絲的意見給予即時回饋，讓粉絲覺得被重視，進而建立品牌忠誠度。
由於俱樂部活動有限，如何在熱烈的活動之後維持人氣是粉絲行銷的另一項重要工作。很多粉絲可能因為一次活動的誘惑而進入俱樂部，那麼活動之後如何吸引他們繼續停留？一般來說俱樂部領袖此時要發起新一輪的話題，而這輪話題能否留住粉絲，與領袖個人能力的關係很大。
粉絲行銷的最高境界，就是讓品牌融入粉絲的日常生活，讓論壇成為粉絲生活的一部分，有些社區已經做到了這一點。愛錶族論壇是全國領先的鐘錶社區，這個腕錶粉自發組建的社區幾乎涵蓋所有鐘錶品牌論壇，更難得的是而且每個論壇都很有人氣，成員層次也不低，他們自發地分享心得，上傳圖片發起討論，還在各地組成分會，時常發起活動，是粉絲行銷的理想模式。

What we want you to know is that fan marketing is as simple and effective as it seems. How to avoid the negative spread of fans and how does fan marketing continue? These are all questions that should be clarified before doing fan marketing.

Fan Club's marketing magic

Case 1: And Lu Xue's draft marketing

The warm radiance of ""Super Girl"" opened the era of drafts, and the ""Happy Boys"", ""My Show"", ""Star Avenue"" and other talent shows emerged one after another, and the fan clubs were established one after another, becoming the main target of the company to promote the fan economy.
In March 2008, and Lu Xue (ice cream brand) teamed up with Fan Network to hold a network singing competition, open to national netizens, as long as they upload their own singing films to participate, star jury composed of Lin Junjie and Jinsha. The result of the online voting will determine the outcome. The winner will probably sign with Haidie Records and become the same door as the youth idols Lin Junjie and Jinsha. In the voting session, a cute and frosty cream can be exchanged for a voting code, which is equivalent to 100 online votes. A super cute code is equivalent to 200 times online voting.
Everyone is eager to be famous, and this event launched by Lu Xue has given many people hope, and the star jury has satisfied the desire of fans to chase stars to a certain extent, so this event received a warm response from the market and eventually attracted more than With 15,000 participants, the number of online views exceeded 60 million. At the same time, the sales volume of Lu Xue's cute and creamy cream increased.

Case 2: Mantra Zhu's creative fan marketing

As the pride of the confectionery industry, Perfetti Van Melle SPA, which specializes in all kinds of candy and gum, has dozens of brands and nearly one hundred products, and Mandala is one of its sub-products. .
Mandala is well-known in more than 100 countries around the world for its unique taste and pearl-like appearance. Its advertising is very creative, such as sending the mandolin on the table into the mouth of friends through the shadow of the hand. Climbers standing upside down on a cliff can also free their hands to enjoy the deliciousness of the mandala.
Because it is mainly aimed at young people, Man Tuozhu pays great attention to online communication. Not only does the brand have its own website, but also has its own brand area in Fan. For example, fans can discuss how the mandala advertisement is made in the forum. You can also create magical illusion works yourself, vote for the winners by online voting, and the winners can get very rich prizes.
Mandaz's online marketing is very popular, with more than 50,000 fan groups and more than 7 million forum visits. In the hearts of young people, the fun culture that Mandala conveys under its unique creativity is “really a mandala” with extraordinary charm.

Case 3: Fans of brands such as Lego participate in marketing

Similar to Mandala, Lego, which has been developing the toy brand for 80 years, pays great attention to the creative marketing of fans. Lego encourages fans to share their creative gameplay in the LEGO community. This simple plug-in, buckle toy has been popular all over the world for decades, and the creative sharing of the LEGO community has contributed. The 200-year-old toothpaste brand Colgate encourages fans to create their own toothpaste ads, which is highly desirable because it satisfies the fans' desire to perform. Pepsi-Cola has also carried out vigorous fan marketing through activities such as ""burning microphone"" and ""beautiful hair color to show me"". The effect is extraordinary.
These fan marketing, through the interactive participation of fans, made the brand pass the 10th and the 10th pass, and got a fissile effect.
How does fan marketing continue to be effective
From the above cases, we can see that the marketing of fans is strong. Since the marketing effect of fans is so good, the investment is negligible compared to traditional marketing, so why not promote to all walks of life, and even many strong brands have no fans at all. Is fan marketing really simple and effective as it seems, how to avoid the negative spread of fans and how does fan marketing continue? These are all questions that should be clarified before doing fan marketing.
First of all, it is not suitable for fan marketing. The brand must first consider the following issues:

Which class is the brand's customer, and how much brand awareness is there between them?
Does the brand have a fan base and how much brand loyalty do they have?
Is buying behavior that appeals to consumers based on advertising, activity, or the product itself?
To figure out the above problems, companies will come to think about ways to market.
Does the content of fan marketing expression match the brand culture?
Can marketing activities promote sales growth?
How to ensure that fans spread positive information?

All the questions are clear, and the brand can start fan marketing. An important step in fan marketing is to engage in interactive activities within the Fan Club. How to turn the activities of participating clubs into a part of fan life is the key to the success of fan marketing. For example, writing blogs, posting photos, letting fans share their life stories related to products, attracting more fans to participate in discussions, etc., are all practical marketing methods. In this process, an influential club leader is needed as an interactive bridge between brands and fans, guiding the fans' speeches and interactions, giving immediate feedback to fans' opinions, and making fans feel valued and building brand loyalty. degree.
Due to the limited activities of the club, how to maintain popularity after a lively event is another important job of fan marketing. Many fans may enter the club because of the temptation of an event. How do you attract them to stay after the event? In general, club leaders are about to launch a new round of topics at this time, and whether this round of topics can retain fans is very much related to the individual abilities of the leaders.
The highest level of fan marketing is to integrate the brand into the daily life of the fans, making the forum a part of the fan life, and some communities have already done this. The Love Watch Forum is the leading watch community in the country. The self-organized community of watch powder covers almost all watch brands forums. What is even more rare is that each forum is very popular and the membership level is not low. They spontaneously share their experiences. Uploading pictures to initiate discussions, and forming chapters in various places, often launching activities, is an ideal mode for fan marketing.
