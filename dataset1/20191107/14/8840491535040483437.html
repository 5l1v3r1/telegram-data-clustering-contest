      <p>A bridge between the Greenway in Turlough and the historic village is to be provided next year, it has been confirmed.</p>
      <p>The project is to be progressed to the planning and consultation stages next month with a view to work starting in 2020.</p>
      <p>The original plan for the bridge was shot down following some local objections.</p>
      <p>But a new location has been found for the bridge that addresses the reservations initially raised by a number of residents.</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Kilcoyne, cathaoirleach, said he was disappointed the proposal had fallen behind somewhat,</p>
      <p>But he welcomed the news that the Part 8 procedure is imminent.</p>
      <p>Councillor Blackie Gavin said it is a step forward and the Part 8 will be supported by the elected members.</p>
      <p>Councillor Cyrl Burke stated the project has taken a long time but is now closer to becoming a reality.</p>
