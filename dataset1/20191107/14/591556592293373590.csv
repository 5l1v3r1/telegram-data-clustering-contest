If you're in the market for a tablet that's repairable, then Microsoft's Surface Pro X should be on your shortlist. Why? Because according to repair specialists at iFixit, Microsoft has upped its repairability game dramatically.According to iFixit, ""the Surface Pro X is one of the more repairable tablets we've seen lately,"" which is high praise from a company that spends a lot of time tearing down and analyzing the repairability of devices.CNET: Microsoft Surface Pro X review: Sleek, but software hasn't caught up yetBut there's more. Compared to Apple's tablet offering, the Surface Pro X is ""far more repairable than any iPad in the past nine years.""So, what makes the Surface Pro X so repairable? A combination of things:

A super easy to replace SSD (all it needs is a SIM eject pin and a T3 driver -- there's no need to remove the screen to do this).
The display is held down with foam adhesive that doesn't require heat or solvents to remove, which is a first for tablets according to iFixit.

But the design could be made even more friendly. The battery is still glued down in place and requires a lot of disassembly to reach, and there are a number of delicate ribbon cables that can be torn or broken.But it's still progress, and a sign that Microsoft is taking repairability into account when designing its devices.
