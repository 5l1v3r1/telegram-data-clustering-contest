07 Nov 2019, 14:58

Cape Town - From UFO sightings, to inside one of the most expensive hotels in London, to a saucy award-winning series - here are our top three recommendations to watch tonight. 

UFOs: The Lost Evidence

18:30 - Discovery Family (DStv 136)
Our technology advanced rapidly over the past few decades. Could extra-terrestrials have been involved in aiding these innovations? And what about alien encounters with presidents and other people in power – have these occurred? And if so, how have they affected our day-to-day lives? UFOs: The Lost Evidence connects the dots between alleged UFO sightings and abductions and real-world events.




A Hotel for the Super Rich and Famous

20:01 - BBC Lifestyle (DStv 174)
This documentary series going behind-the-scenes at London's Corinthia hotel, looking at how it tries to stand out in a fiercely competitive market.



The L WordShowmaxEnjoy this long-running and award-winning drama about the lives and loves of a group of women in LA, with all the hookups, breakups... and everything in between. A reboot of the popular of the show is scheduled to premiere in the coming months.
