UK’s funniest business names including gems like Spruce Springclean and Surelock Homes
While many businesses choose names based on who founded them and others simply describe what they do there is a third sort too - the ones where the owner decides to have a bit of fun. These are the best business names we've seen

When it comes to choosing a tradesperson to fix a leak, fit a lock or replace a window, there are plenty of options.
But as well as looking at reviews, asking for recommendations and calling for quotes for the job, we'd be lying if we said we didn't also take the names into account.
And while a solid, respectable name we've heard of before might help inspire confidence, it's no guarantee of quality.
And that means it can pay to stand out - so, with this in mind, tradesperson comparison site HaMuch.com decided to track down the best comedy business names in the country.

HaMuch founder Tarquin Purdie said: “With the sheer volume of tradespeople in the UK, standing out from the crowd is an uphill struggle and whether you compete on price, provide a better level of service, or simply catch the eye with a creative company name, it’s important to have a differentiating factor between you and the competition.""
It found some tue gems - from the all-female plumbing business Stopcocks to North Lincolnshire gardeners Lawn N Order and Brighton removals firm He-Van.
