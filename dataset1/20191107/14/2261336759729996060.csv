MMA SQUARED: Bringing back the caption contest, because it’s Greg Hardy fight week
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Chris Rini
In the early days of MMA Squared we ran a Friday Caption Contest (the FCC), and some of your submissions were legit hilarious. Ply your trade in the comments section.


“Kim Winslow is the referee for this fight! Not your opponent” - Fedor’s Sweater

A tip of the pen to BE commenter Fedor’s Sweater who won the first ever caption contest back in December 2018. Maybe I’ll just run this same image every Greg Hardy fight week.
A commenter yesterday asked if I’d do a shirt of print of one of these cartoons. I’ll talk to cottonbureau about doing something later this month. I’ve selected two drawings to choose from, one of Israel Adesanya’s comments that ‘Jon Jones looks like a Dorito on chopsticks’ or Jorge Masvidal baptizing Ben Askren. Let me know which you like and I’ll get on it. Thanks for all your support, this is a blast.






Take care of yourself and I’ll talk to you next week.
