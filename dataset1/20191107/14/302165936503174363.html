      <p>CARACAS, Nov 7 — The angry, oppressed citizens are actors and their caps and overcoats evoke 19th-century France rather than modern-day Venezuela.</p>
      <p>But local people going to the theatre to see a new performance of “Les Miserables” in Caracas could be forgiven for thinking this show was about them.</p>
      <p>In a country deep in economic crisis, getting the show on the stage was a heroic feat almost on the scale of the epic novel it is based on.</p>
      <p>“It was an act of rebellion,” said producer Claudia Salazar.</p>
      <p>The social injustice in Victor Hugo’s 1862 novel — and songs such as <i>Do You Hear the People Sing?</i> and <i>I Dreamed a Dream</i> — resonate with Venezuelans.</p>
      <p>“It’s a real classic, so it could be adapted to any period,” said one woman who came to see the show, Gabriela Oropeza, 43, a filmmaker.</p>
      <p>“But for us right now, it is marvellous to see a show like this,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This is a momentous event for our country, with a magnificent message, very much suited to the social reality of the moment.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>I Dreamed a Dream</b>
      </p>
      <p>Salazar said she fell in love with “Les Miserables” when she first saw it two decades ago on stage in New York.</p>
      <p>Many people said she was “crazy” when she applied for the rights to stage it in her native country.</p>
      <p>She spent three years securing sponsorship from private companies to finance the show.</p>
      <p>Then her team had to cast it, rehearse it and build giant sets — all in a country suffering shortages of cash, food and basic supplies.</p>
      <p>After seeing the audience jump to their feet to applaud the cast, she observed: “The craziness is contagious.”</p>
      <p>“We are resisting and trying to be rebels, faced with a situation that threatens to knock us down.”</p>

        <b>Castle on a Cloud</b>
      </p>
      <p>Founded in 1983, the Teresa Carreno state theatre used to be considered one of the top theatres in Latin America.</p>

      <p>But artistic life there had all but ground to a halt in the crisis.</p>
      <p>Its seats are stained and maintaining the building is tricky.</p>
      <p>It has lately been more often used to host pro-government political gatherings than plays, dance or music.</p>
      <p>The state allowed the producers to use the theatre for their “rebellious” show, however.</p>
      <p>The producers fixed the air conditioning, but still had to reduce the capacity of the auditorium from 2,500 to 1,400 for it to function properly.</p>
      <p>“Les Miserables” has reminded the public what the theatre used to be like before the country was stricken by poverty and high levels of violent crime.</p>
      <p>“This is like living in a normal country,” said one audience member, Ricardo Skenazi, a 21-year-old student. “Just for a moment.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hear the People Sing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Venezuelan audiences “identify deeply” with the show, said one of the members of the all-Venezuelan cast, baritone Gaspar Colon.</p>
      <p>He plays the part of Javert, a policeman chasing the tale’s working-class hero, released convict Jean Valjean.</p>
      <p>At US$30 (RM124) to US$65, tickets cost at least double the minimum salary in a country crippled by inflation.</p>
      <p>But for those who can afford it, a few hours in the theatre offer a respite from their own economic and political crisis.</p>
      <p>“Horrendous things may be happening” in the country, said Colon. “But marvellous things are happening too.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>At the Barricade</b>
      </p>
      <p>When angry students set up barricades on stage, it is more than a historical curiosity as it might be for an audience in London or New York.</p>
      <p>It is a sight Venezuelans are used to from the recent years of street protests against President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
      <p>“The first rehearsals were enormously emotional. We were crying,” said performer Mariana Gomez. She plays the part of Madame Thenardier, one of the hapless citizens caught up in the drama.</p>
      <p>For her, the barricade scene, when the rebels of Paris are massacred, was the most painful of all.</p>
      <p>That was close to the bone in a country where some 200 people have been killed in protests since 2014.</p>
      <p>“That really moved us,” Gomez said. “A lot of people are suffering.”</p>
      <p>Yet the story of Valjean’s redemption signals hope for a happy ending.</p>
      <p>In Victor Hugo’s vision, Gomez said, “there is always hope.” — AFP</p>
