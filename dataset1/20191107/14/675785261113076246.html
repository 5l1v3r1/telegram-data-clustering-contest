      <h1>England squad announced as James Maddison makes the cut but Jack Grealish misses out</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Southgate has officially announced his England squad for the final two European qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:00:02+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has kept faith with James Maddison after naming a 27-man squad to face Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> midfielder Maddison was sweating on his place after being pictured in a casino while England played Czech Republic last month despite being sent home ill from the last squad.</p>
      <p>England boss Southgate was unhappy with Maddison and warned him about being his future behaviour but has resisted any temptation to drop him out of the squad.</p>
      <p>But there is no place for Aston Villa's Jack Grealish and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> defender Michael Keane is the big casualty after Englandâ€™s defeat in Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>Southgate has been checking on Grealish but the Villa midfielder has been carrying an injury, although expects to play this weekend.</p>

      <p>Manchester City's fit-again John Stones returns while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - with four goals in his last three starts - returns to the squad after missing out last time.</p>
      <p>Fabian Delph is also in the squad along with Ross Barkley who has been out of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> starting line-up for the past month while Callum Hudson-Odoi is promoted back to the seniors.</p>
