CBS News fires staffer who leaked ABC News video about Epstein cover-up: Report
07 Nov 2019, 14:47 by Mike Brest
The former ABC News employee who leaked the video of Amy Robach talking about the network refusing to run her story on one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers was fired from their current job at CBS News.
Project Veritas released a video Tuesday of Robach discussing the information she received years earlier from Virginia Roberts Giuffre on a hot mic. She can be heard expressing her frustration surrounding ABC News's refusal to air the interview and claimed that the network made the decision after receiving threats from Buckingham Palace after they had found out Prince Andrew was implicated in the story. She also alleged that Epstein may have been murdered.
""It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything,"" she stated. ""I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it.""
The former ABC News employee who accessed the video has been fired from the person's current position at CBS News, according to journalist Yashar Ali.



""Two sources familiar with the matter tell me that CBS News has fired the staffer in question. This comes after ABC informed CBS that they had determined who accessed the footage of Amy Robach expressing her frustrations about the Epstein story,"" Ali tweeted Thursday morning.
ABC News is not sure if the individual who accessed the video was the same person who shared it with Project Veritas or if that individual gave it to someone else who passed it along.



Robach released a statement after the video was released claiming her comments were ""caught in a private moment of frustration"" and added that her interview with Giuffre ""didn't air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC's editorial standards about her allegations.""
Her response echoes that of the network, which said, ""At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it. That work has led to a two-hour documentary and 6-part podcast that will air in the new year.""
UPDATE: ABC News declined to comment on the matter.
