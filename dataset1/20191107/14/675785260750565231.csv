Shoppers have mocked a pair of designer shoes on sale at TK Maxx saying that look like they're covered with swimming pool-style shoe guards.
Others joked that the £100 footwear by Joseph were ""perfect"" for wearing during a foot and mouth epidemic.
The black and blue creation were also dubbed 'operating chic' and that they gave off a 'swimming pool look.'
Janet McConnell posted snaps of the boots from TK Maxx's website, adding: ""Amazing! They really have captured that 'Swimming pool' look!!""
Lauren Matthews said: ""Perfect for when you want to look fancy during a foot and mouth epidemic!""

Alice Taylor added: ""Voila! I can't tell you how long I have been searching for some boots, kinda cowboy style, but not and look like you're wearing floor protectors but with the heel showing through.
""Amazing people amazing!""
Claire HillI said: ""I wore something like that when I worked in an isolation unit in a hospital.

And Jenny Munro-Hunt said: ""Definitely good for visiting a showhome.
