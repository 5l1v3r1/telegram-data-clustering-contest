      <h1>Tesla’s new Autopilot traffic cone detection feature demonstrated (video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:54:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Atiya</a></address>
      <p>The latest Tesla<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/tesla-autopilot-update-changelog/"> update</a> for users with the Full Self-Driving package brought useful new AutoPilot features to Tesla cars; including the ability to see and respond to traffic cones while in AutoPilot mode.</p>
      <blockquote>“The driving visualization now displays traffic cones. In cases where a traffic cone is detected and Navigate on Autopilot is engaged (requires Full Self Driving Capability), the vehicle is designed to suggest a lane change (or attempt a lane if REQUIRE LANE CHANGE CONFIRMATION is set to NO) to avoid cones. As always, you are responsible for your vehicle and are required to pay attention at all times.”</blockquote>
      <p>Now, courtesy of Tesla hacker verygreen, AKA ‘green the only’, we can see the road through the eyes of a Tesla in autopilot mode.  In the second video, we can see how Tesla readjusts the drivable area based on the obstacles in the construction site:</p>

      <p>Tesla owners report that at present not all cones appear to be recognized by Tesla Autopilot (<i>though this will improve over time)</i>, making the warning that drivers should always remain aware and in control of their car at all times even more important.</p>
      <p>Even though the feature still needs some perfecting, it still looks promising in its early stages- indicating that it won’t be long until the autopilot feature makes its debut in city roads.</p>
