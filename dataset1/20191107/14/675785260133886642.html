      <h1>Playgroup rejects twin boys, 3, because they have two 'unnatural' gay dads</h1>
      <h2>The Swiss day care centre claimed a gay couple raising children is “neither normal nor natural” - and refused to back down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:47:33+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Three-year-old twin boys were told to find another day care centre because their fathers are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lgbt">gay</a> , it has been claimed.</p>
      <p>The toddlers were turned away from the Swiss playgroup "for the benefit of the children".</p>
      <p>The daycare centre in Lenzburg, Switzerland, refused to enroll Rafael and Rahul - and say they know they are discriminating.</p>
      <p>It's owner believes that a gay couple raising children is “neither normal nor natural.”</p>
      <p>They told Stefan, one of the twins’ fathers, that the decision was for their own good.</p>
      <p>“She said that little ones could be very mean to each other, so she did not want to have children from a gay couple,” he told <a href="https://www.20min.ch/ro/news/suisse/story/Jumeaux-d-un-couple-gay-refuses-par-une-garderie-20204113"><i>20 Minutes</i> </a><i>.</i></p>

      <p>The day care officials say it is privately funded - and is under no obligation to accept the children of same-sex couples.</p>
      <p>When approached by Swiss newspaper <a href="https://www.gmx.ch/magazine/panorama/zeichen-schwulenhass-kiss-lenzburg-34151206"><i>Sonntagsblick</i> </a>, the owner refused to apologise, said she has the right to decide which children she cares for, and claimed she had been the victim of a “witch hunt".</p>
      <p>Lawyer Cordula Niklaus said: “This case shows that protection against hatred and discrimination is a necessity. If these children had Jewish parents, such an exclusion would already be punishable."</p>
      <p>Dad Stefan added: “It’s good that our case led to a discussion about homophobia in society.</p>
      <p>“We hope that no other gay or lesbian couple will have to face the same discrimination that we did.”</p>
