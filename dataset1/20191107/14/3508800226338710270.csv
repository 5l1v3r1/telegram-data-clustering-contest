《痛苦可以分享嗎？》：「黑粉」剝開了人們的真面目，把世界變成了一個動物園
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是一般大眾會鄙視黑粉，並表現出對他人關注沒什麼興趣的模樣，但對黑粉來說，這些大眾「其實不也是急著想被關注」？揭露大眾的偽裝，也會給這類黑粉帶來非常大的喜悅。

【第二部・痛苦的社會學：關於展示和消費痛苦的機制】
黑粉剝開了人們的真面目，把世界變成了一個動物園
如果黑粉只是一兩個零星地出現，還可能是一種個人心理或社會病理學上的現象，但如果黑粉是大量產生，就成了社會現象。在現今社會，一方面，已不太可能透過勞動進行社會貢獻，獲取存在感；另一方面，人們也較少處於互相讓對方快樂的關係，而是彼此貢獻、消費樂趣的關係，如此一來，想透過矚目來取得存在感，也是理所當然。
此時的存在有幾個層次。如果社交層次是第一順位，那麼，就有政治性的存在感，在韓國，以正義為名的「打臉文化」便是典型的例子。政治原本就包含正義問題，人們透過討論、合作或爭執來定義和實現正義的行為，就是政治的一環。但現在的社會已離這種政治越來越遠，政治漸漸只剩政客和官僚，在這個慢性政治嫌惡的社會中，以正義為名的政治表演，就成了可以吸引目光的策略。
不可忽視的是，這類矚目背後都代表了金錢。和我素有往來的民間神學家鄭容澤曾告訴我，歐美早有相關研究結果顯示，這種矚目不只是文化現象，也是經濟現象，有很多媒體和輿論報導在Facebook、YouTube、Afreeca TV直播網等自媒體或個人主播（BJ）平台上能夠獲得多少收益。當然了，所有自媒體都需要和平台上無數的會員競爭，競爭之激烈，和寥寥無幾的傳統媒體大相徑庭，想在這些平台上爭取存在感和目光，就得不斷下猛藥。
那些想透過逗樂別人來吸引關注，且強度越來越強的「內容」之一，就是羞辱他人，遭受羞辱之人則因為羞恥感而不知如何應對。這麼說來，對人類來說最羞恥的會是什麼？恐怕就是在別人面前被剝光。「衣服」是文明的象徵，它掩蓋了羞恥，使人類與動物有所區別，一旦在他人面前被剝光，人便不再是人，而會墮落成獸。對此加以嘲笑、以此為樂，甚至把遭受羞辱者丟到街上示眾的人，就屬某種「黑粉」。
黑粉的先驅在《聖經》裡也曾出現，那就是挪亞的其中一個兒子——含（Ham）的故事。某天，挪亞喝得爛醉，脫個精光就睡著了，此時含非但沒有裝作不知或幫忙掩飾，還告訴自己的兩個兄弟。雖然《聖經》中沒有出現「捉弄」這個詞彙，但把別人的糗事傳出去，就是讓當事人丟臉的行為。《聖經》箴言中有句話是這樣的：「屢次挑錯的，離間密友。」黑粉的嘲弄行為不僅讓當事人丟臉，也會讓說話者和聆聽者漸行漸遠。
而現代黑粉的目的，自然是在公共場合羞辱某人、使其丟臉，對他們來說，遭受羞辱的當事人是用來恥笑和捉弄，並非用來憐憫的對象。如果對象剛好不是人而是動物，那就更不會有罪惡感了，放肆大笑也無所謂。總之，不穿衣服、不用遮掩重要部位的動物當然就是被展示的對象，因為牠們不知羞恥，所以觀賞牠們不需要保持距離，就好比動物園似的。事實上，黑粉想要的就是把整個世界都變成動物園。
「你不也仰賴大家的關注過活嗎？就讓我來揭開你的偽善吧！」
當黑粉想要透過羞辱他人來誘發大眾的笑聲，把當事人變成展示品來換取關注時，通常第一個被拿來使用的藉口，就是「偽善」。因為偽善就是對人的蔑視，因此即使揭露了，揭露者也可以獲得道德辯護。脫掉當事人虛偽的外衣，令其赤裸地面向大眾時，黑粉是開心的，如果偽善者剛好具有很大的權力或平時自以為是，那就更令人開心。
事實上，「打臉（finger-pointing）」是一種很古老的政治手段，特別是點出支配者的虛偽和雙重標準，這已在受支配的群體中被廣為使用，效果也很顯著。在國際人權運動中，也經常使用這種方法來揭露西方世界的偽善雙重標準。而將這種打臉行為正當化的，正是「正義」，這點不容忽視。
近來若觀察韓國社會便會發現，連日以來，上搜尋排行榜第一名的新聞，大部分都是名人的「醜聞」、偽君子的八卦，以及有關他們垮台的新聞，比起深深影響了生活的政治或經濟議題更能引人注意。笑看那些一直都比自己過得更好、讓自己相形見絀的人們失去了地位，透過感受他人的痛苦來振奮自己的心情，這幾乎是成天把「完蛋了」放在嘴邊過活的那類人唯一振奮的時刻。
特別是名人聲望的殞落，它們之所以能帶來更大的快感，就是因為一旦開始墜落，溜到谷底可是比一般人來得既快又深。而隨著下墜的速度越快，墜落得越深不見底，受到打擊的當事人就更顯悲慘，對於那些想要享受別人痛苦的人來說，名人是非常好的獵物。名人墮落的八卦會以光速傳播給大眾，並遭到徹底的剝光，當一個原本很有名望的人走向衰敗時，人們會群起圍觀。吃著爆米花、看著名人完蛋，世上可沒什麼比這個更加有趣的了。
除了曝光其偽善之外，名人之所以成為黑粉的目標，還有另一個原因。因為在黑粉的世界中，為了不斷引起注意，必須推出「更強的東西」，才能不斷吸引人們的興趣，順便提升自己的「聲望」。而提高自己「聲望值」的最佳方法，就是毀滅一個名人。「我贏過那個人了！」的心情，就好像自己一舉站上那個人的地位一般。
因為如此，黑粉樂於挑戰名人，好比武俠小說中的「踢館」，黑粉尋找著那些傳聞中武功高強的道館挑戰。找名人挑戰這件事令人興味盎然，而大眾則是拿著爆米花前來觀看就可以了。更有甚者，在網路發達的當今世界中，黑粉更可以完成過去不可能的任務——直接上門挑戰名人。不管是辯論或是用其他方法，只要能讓名人垮台，就能瞬間聲名遠播。想當然耳，被踢館的當事人也就要面臨丟臉和被羞辱的局面了。
而對此火上加油的，則是媒體，目前我們社會中的大多數媒體性質都是黑粉，且正在系統化地量產。媒體最常處理的話題就是「八卦醜聞」，而我們常看到的報導型態都是揭人之短，通常以藝人為焦點，假作大義地將其隱私和偽裝揭開，暴露在大眾眼前。如此這般，新聞媒體將名人醜聞政治化，再把政治醜聞化，在這個時代，從事政治是不可能的。
然而這種被揭開了偽裝、在眾人面前丟臉的經驗，不僅是名人才會經歷。在這個時代下，每個人都有被剝光示眾的風險，這就是當今社會空間的基本特徵。
社會不是一個能夠與人素面相見的地方。社會學家厄文．高夫曼（Erving Goffman）曾說，當我們走進社會空間時，都要扮演一個被賦予的角色，會戴上面具與人來往，而面具背後的素顏究竟長相如何並不重要，重要的是，個人是否忠於自己被賦予的角色。如果我們忠於這個角色，就該對別人面具底下的面孔裝作若無其事、無所關心，這是所有在社會上闖蕩的人都必須遵守的禮儀。根據這點，其實社會上互相左右的每一個人，都是蒙面的存在，也就是偽君子。
黑粉鄙視並嫌惡這種偽裝，他們希望得到公眾的關注，卻又同時鄙視公眾。一般大眾會鄙視黑粉，並表現出對他人關注沒什麼興趣的模樣，但對黑粉來說，這些大眾「其實不也是急著想被關注」？揭露大眾的偽裝，也會給這類黑粉帶來非常大的喜悅。對黑粉來說，不僅是名人的偽裝，玩著假面遊戲的普通人也是噁心的目標，一般大眾的日常生活、社會關係，也是他們想揭露的。
只要一般人有任何不檢點，黑粉就會全面動員起來，把當事人挖出來當街示眾。事情發生的原因和前後背景並不重要，對他們來說，重要的是事實本身，而且是那些可以讓當事人脫掉偽裝、展現醜惡內在的事實。所以對黑粉來說，重要的並非事件的脈絡，而是片段式的、能夠呈現當事人偽裝的「真相」（fact），而比起「事實」，這裡的真相更接近「短篇小說」。
黑粉的話語和形態之所以大部分都顯得邪惡，原因就是在此。他們嫌惡偽善的行為，揭露偽善令他們感到痛快，同時又能得到其他人的關注。他們認為邪惡在道德上比偽善更正當，這才是人類本色，也就是更接近人類素顏的模樣。由此來看，他們真正想要破壞的，是允許大家玩假面遊戲的舞台——社會。

在旁觀者不理解的痛苦背後，是一個個的「人」在吶喊：我在這裡，請看見我！
每個人的痛苦都不同，但痛苦帶來的孤獨與寂寞，是相通的。支持陪伴者，跟同理受苦者一樣重要，為創傷者和陪伴者創造一種新的相處之道，走出痛苦的迴圈，是我們所能做的最好的事。

本書特色


一本細膩探究痛苦形式與核心、深思社會結構與個人心理因素，尋求解決之道的另類療癒之作。
作者特別為台灣讀者撰寫繁體中文版序文。


允許悲傷、擁抱脆弱，才能真正地看見痛苦，與痛苦同行。幫助受傷的人說出生命中無處安放的痛，讓「我們」一起好起來。


從高度階級化的韓國切入，以社會學視角，看見全人類的痛苦。一本來回爬梳痛苦的養成過程、痛苦在不同階級的展演，以及藉由痛苦所壯大的宗教與網路經濟，如剝開層層洋蔥，深刻探討「痛苦效應」的驚人之作。


原來，我們過去所理解的「痛苦」，只是表象而已……

生而為人，一定都曾陷入痛苦，但我的痛苦，無法與你的痛苦劃上等號。
現代社會中，許多人的靈魂都生了病，當人人皆痛苦的時代來臨，卻無法彼此同理，支持系統也難以建立，個人該如何才能走出這種強大的情緒監牢？甚至，藉由述說並分享痛苦的經驗，找回與外界喪失已久的連結？

不僅婚姻貌合神離，丈夫破產後還瞞著自己逃走，徒留鉅額債務的宣雅
無論如何都無法從喪妻之痛走出、最後一頭栽進了神祕宗教的學者

他們時時自問：

為什麼遭遇如此不幸的，不是別人，而是我？
無論我怎麼費力形容，為什麼一說出口，我的痛苦就顯得平庸至極，跟其他人毫無不同？
別人都說經歷痛苦是有意義的，但如果只是因為沒得選擇，此後也會不斷發生……那麼，意義何在？


活在社會中的每一個人，無論過去與未來，都懷抱各自的創傷前行，也都需要著他人。若人不是孤島，我們就該思考：


身為受苦者的親友，如何才能正確陪伴？
無法負荷對方的情緒重擔時，陪伴者如何應對與自救？
當感到孤立無援時，如何才能暫時擺脫情緒，給自己喘息的空間？
當「極度痛苦」破壞了個人內在對外在世界的交流管道，如何重新打造溝通橋梁？

當痛苦無法被述說，它就不會消失；它會化為一堵高牆，將個體與他人全然隔絕。然而，痛苦的敘事該如何才能正確形塑？深陷痛苦時，唯有語言才是唯一的解決之道嗎？原本極度個人化的「痛苦」心理，在擴大為集體的心理狀態之後，又反映了哪些社會與階級問題？韓國人權工作者嚴寄鎬以其獨特的社工視角切入，從集體與個人經驗雙管齊下，為無數在痛苦情緒中掙扎浮沉的受苦者與陪伴者，提出最深刻的觀察與建言，探討遭逢巨大創傷的人們該如何互相扶持，邁向復原之路。

Can pain be shared? "": ""Black powder"" stripped people of their true colors and turned the world into a zoo
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the general public will despise the black powder and show no interest in the attention of others. But for the black powder, these people are ""not really eager to be concerned"". Exposing the public's disguise will also bring great joy to this kind of black powder.



Text: Yan sent 镐 (엄기호 지음)
[The second part of the painful sociology: the mechanism of display and consumption pain]
Black powder peels off the true colors of people and turns the world into a zoo
If the black powder appears only one or two sporadicly, it may also be a personal psychological or social pathological phenomenon, but if the black powder is produced in large quantities, it becomes a social phenomenon. In today's society, on the one hand, it is not possible to make social contributions through labor and gain a sense of existence; on the other hand, people are less in a relationship that makes each other happy, but a relationship of mutual contribution and consumption. It is only natural that I want to gain a sense of existence through my eyes.
There are several levels of existence at this time. If the social level is the first overall, then there is a political sense of existence. In South Korea, the ""face culture"" in the name of justice is a typical example. Politics originally included the issue of justice. People's behavior through definition, cooperation or disputes to define and realize justice is a part of politics. But nowadays society has become farther and farther away from this kind of politics. Politics and politicians and bureaucrats are gradually left. In this society of chronic political dislike, the political performance in the name of justice has become a strategy that can attract attention.
It cannot be ignored that money behind this type of attention is representative of money. Zheng Rongze, a folk theologian who has always been with me, told me that the results of relevant research in Europe and the United States have shown that this kind of attention is not only a cultural phenomenon, but also an economic phenomenon. There are many media and public opinion reports on Facebook, YouTube, Afreeca TV live broadcast network, etc. How much revenue can be earned from the media or personal anchor (BJ) platform. Of course, all self-media needs to compete with countless members on the platform. The competition is fierce, and there are very different traditional media. If you want to gain a sense of presence and gaze on these platforms, you have to continue to use drugs.
One of the ""contents"" that wants to attract attention by amused others and become stronger and stronger is to humiliate others, and those who suffer from humiliation do not know how to deal with it because of shame. So what is the most shameful thing for humans? I am afraid that I will be stripped in front of others. ""Clothing"" is a symbol of civilization. It masks shame and makes humans and animals different. Once they are stripped in front of others, people are no longer human beings, but will become fallen beasts. It is a kind of ""black powder"" to laugh at this and enjoy it. Even those who have been humiliated to the public on the street are some kind of ""black powder.""
The pioneer of black powder also appeared in the Bible, that is, one of Noah's sons, the story of Ham. One day, Noah was drunk and fell asleep after taking off the light. At this time, she did not pretend to be ignorant or help to cover up, and told her two brothers. Although the word ""catch-up"" does not appear in the Bible, the act of spreading someone else's anecdote is the act of making the person lose face. There is a saying in the Bible's rumor that ""there are repeated mistakes, and close friends."" The taunting of the black powder not only makes the party lose face, but also makes the speaker and the listener drift away.
The purpose of modern black powder is naturally to humiliate someone and make them humiliated in public. For them, the humiliated party is used to ridicule and tease, not to be used for mercy. If the object is not just a human but an animal, then there is no sense of guilt. It doesn't matter if you laugh and laugh. In short, animals that don't wear clothes and don't cover important parts are of course the objects to be displayed, because they are not ashamed, so watching them does not need to maintain distance, just like a zoo. In fact, what black powder wants is to turn the whole world into a zoo.
""Do you not rely on everyone's attention to live? Let me uncover your hypocrisy!""
When black powder wants to provoke public laughter by humiliating others and turning the party into a display for exchange of attention, the first excuse to be used is “hypocrisy”. Because hypocrisy is a contempt for people, even if exposed, the exposer can obtain moral defense. Black powder is happy when you take off the false appearance of the party and make it naked to the public. If the hypocrisy has just a lot of power or is self-righteous, it is even more enjoyable.
In fact, ""finger-pointing"" is a very old political means, especially the hypocrisy and double standards of the dominators, which have been widely used in the dominated groups, and the effect is also significant. In the international human rights movement, this method is often used to expose the double standards of hypocrisy in the Western world. It is precisely ""justice"" that justifies this kind of face-lifting behavior. This cannot be ignored.
Recently, if you observe Korean society, you will find that most of the news on the top of the list for the past few days is the ""scandal"" of celebrities, the gossip of hypocrites, and the news about their collapse, which has deeply affected life. Political or economic issues are more noticeable. Laughing at those who have always been better than themselves and who have dwarfed themselves, lost their status and invigorated their feelings by feeling the pain of others. This is almost the kind of person who puts ""completed"" on his lips. The only exciting moment.
Especially the decline of celebrity prestige, they can bring greater pleasure, because once they start to fall, slipping to the bottom of the valley is faster and deeper than the average person. As the speed of the fall is faster, the deeper the fall is, the more affected the victim is, and the celebrity is a very good prey for those who want to enjoy the pain of others. Celebrity's fallen gossip will spread to the public at the speed of light and will be completely stripped. When a prestigious person goes down, people will stand up. Eating popcorn and watching famous people finish, there is nothing more interesting in this world than this.
In addition to exposing its hypocrisy, there is another reason why celebrities have become the target of black powder. Because in the world of black powder, in order to attract attention, it is necessary to introduce ""stronger things"" in order to attract people's interest and improve their ""prestige"" by the way. The best way to improve your ""prestige value"" is to destroy a celebrity. The mood of ""I won that person!"" is like standing in the position of the person in one fell swoop.
Because of this, Black Powder is happy to challenge celebrities, like the ""Kicking Pavilion"" in the martial arts novels, and Black Powder is looking for the rumored martial arts challenges. It’s fun to find celebrities to challenge this, and the public is just watching popcorn. What's more, in today's world where the Internet is developed, black powder can accomplish the impossible tasks in the past – directly to the celebrity. Whether it's debate or other methods, as long as the celebrity can collapse, it will be instantly famous. Of course, the parties involved in the pavilion will also face humiliation and humiliation.
What fuels this fire is the media. At present, most of the media in our society are black powder and are systematically mass-produced. The most frequently dealt topic in the media is the ""gossip scandal"", and the type of reporting we often see is a short-cut, usually focusing on the artist, pretending to reveal its privacy and disguise, and expose it to the public. . In this way, the news media politicizes celebrity scandals and then political scandals. In this era, it is impossible to engage in politics.
However, this experience of being disguised and disgraceful in front of everyone is not only experienced by celebrities. In this era, everyone has the risk of being stripped of the show, which is the basic feature of today's social space.
Society is not a place where people can meet people. Sociologist Irving. Erving Goffman once said that when we walk into the social space, we must play a role that is given, and we will wear masks to communicate with people. It is not important how the face behind the mask looks. What is important is that Whether the individual is loyal to the role he is given. If we are loyal to this role, we should pretend that there is nothing to do with the faces under the masks of others. This is a ritual that all people in society must obey. According to this point, in fact, everyone in the society is a masked existence, that is, a hypocrite.
Black powder despise and dislike this disguise. They want to get the public's attention, but at the same time despise the public. The general public will despise the black powder and show no interest in the attention of others. But for the black powder, these people are ""not really eager to be concerned"". Exposing the public's disguise will also bring great joy to this kind of black powder. For black powder, not only the celebrity's disguise, ordinary people playing fake games are also disgusting goals, the general public's daily life, social relations, they also want to expose.
As long as the average person has any unchecked points, the black powder will be fully mobilized, and the parties will be dug out to show the crowd. The reason for the occurrence of the incident and the context before and after is not important. For them, what matters is the fact itself, and the fact that the parties can take off their disguise and show their ugliness. Therefore, for black powder, what is important is not the context of the event, but a fragmentary ""fact"" that can present the party's disguise, and the truth here is closer to the ""short story"" than the ""fact"".
The reason why most of the words and forms of black powder appear evil is here. They are disgusting and hypocritical, revealing the hypocrisy that makes them feel happy, while at the same time getting the attention of others. They believe that evil is more morally justified than hypocrisy. This is the true nature of human beings, that is, closer to the human face. From this point of view, what they really want to destroy is the stage that allows everyone to play fake games - society.

Behind the pain that the onlookers don't understand, there are individual ""people"" crying: I am here, please see me!
Everyone's pain is different, but the loneliness and loneliness brought about by pain are connected. Supporting companions is as important as the suffering of the same people, creating a new way for the traumatists and companions to get along, and getting out of the painful circle is the best thing we can do.

Book features


An exquisite healing work that explores painful forms and cores, ponders social structures and individual psychological factors, and seeks solutions.
The author writes a traditional Chinese version of the preface for Taiwanese readers.


Allow sorrow, embrace fragility, truly see pain, walk with pain. Help the injured person to say that there is no pain in life, let ""we"" get together.


From the highly classified South Korea, we see the pain of all mankind from a sociological perspective. A process of growing up and down pains, painful performances in different classes, and a religious and online economy that grows through pain, such as stripping layers of onions, deeply explores the amazing work of ""painful effects.""


It turns out that the ""pain"" we have understood in the past is just an appearance...

Being born and being a person must have been in pain, but my pain cannot be equated with your pain.
In modern society, many people's souls are sick. When the times when everyone is suffering, but they can't agree with each other, the support system is difficult to establish. How can individuals get out of this powerful emotional prison? Even by telling and sharing painful experiences, we can find a link that has been lost for a long time.

Suffering from chronic diseases due to old age, physical pain, difficulty in action, but unable to let the family understand one in ten thousand in Xi
Not only does the marriage look like a god, but after the bankruptcy of the husband, he still flees by himself, leaving Xuanya, who has a huge debt.
In any case, it is impossible to get out of the pain of losing a wife, and the last scholar who has planted a mysterious religion

They always ask themselves:

Why are you so unfortunate, not others, but me?
No matter how hard I describe it, why do I say that when I say it, my pain is mediocre and it is no different from others?
Everyone else said that experiencing pain is meaningful, but if it is just because there is no choice, it will happen constantly... Then, what is the significance?


Everyone who lives in society, both past and future, embraces their own wounds and needs others. If people are not isolated, we should think about it:


As a relative of friends who suffer, how can they be accompanied?
How can co-responses and self-help be accompanied by the emotional burden of the other party?
When you feel isolated and helpless, how can you temporarily get rid of your emotions and give yourself a breathing space?
When ""extreme pain"" undermines the communication channel of the individual's inner world, how can we re-establish a bridge of communication?

When pain cannot be said, it will not disappear; it will turn into a high wall, completely separating the individual from others. However, how can a painful narrative be correctly shaped? When the pain is deep, is language only the only solution? What kind of social and class problems have been reflected in the extremely painful psychology of the original personalization after expanding into a collective psychological state? The Korean human rights worker Yan Kezhen cuts through his unique social work perspective. From the collective and personal experience, he puts forward the most profound observations and suggestions for countless suffering and companions who are struggling in painful emotions, and explores the huge trauma. How do people support each other and move toward recovery?
