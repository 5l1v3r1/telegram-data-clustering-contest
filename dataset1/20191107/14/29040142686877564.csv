Most people think about getting a credit card for making a major purchase - buying appliances, a new television, or going on vacation. We also tend to think about credit card rewards the same way - something to look forward to when we use it to buy something expensive. There are, however, a ton of credit cards that are designed to earn you the most on the small, everyday purchases we all make. Here are some of the best ones we've found that'll earn you the most on everything from dining out, going to the movies, or grabbing groceries.


Chase Sapphire Preferred®: A travel monster


Capital One Savor: For the foodies


Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express: Cover the staples


Chase Freedom® Unlimited: Straight up cash


Ink Business Preferred℠ Credit Card: A business beast








Chase Sapphire Preferred®: A travel monster
When it comes to travel cards, it's hard to beat the signup bonus from the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card. Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's equivalent to $750 toward travel when you redeem through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. After that, this card will earn you 2X points on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. Those rewards get even higher as those who redeem for airfare, hotels, car rentals and cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards get 25% more value.

Capital One Savor: For the foodies
The Capital One® Savor® Cash Rewards Credit Card is card built for your inner foodie and your nightlife, with an solid cash back bonus to start you off. New cardholders can earn $300 cash back after you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening. After that, you'll always earn unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% at grocery stores, and 1% on all other purchases. This is one of the highest cash back rates for those common, smaller purchases all of us make - like going out for dinner and a movie.
