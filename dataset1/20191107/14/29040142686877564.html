      <p>Most people think about getting a credit card for making a major purchase - buying appliances, a new television, or going on vacation. We also tend to think about credit card rewards the same way - something to look forward to when we use it to buy something expensive. There are, however, a ton of credit cards that are designed to earn you the most on the small, everyday purchases we all make. Here are some of the best ones we've found that'll earn you the most on everything from dining out, going to the movies, or grabbing groceries.</p>
