      <p>Mirror Online previously contacted Caroline Flack's representative for comment.</p>
      <p>A representative for Caroline told The Sun Online that she is “100% not engaged” but she and Lewis are “still very much together”.</p>
      <p>The couple were thought to have embarked on a whirlwind romance together after she returned to the UK following her stint in Mallorca for Love Island over the summer.</p>
      <p>Caroline has been drip feeding her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account with a series of loved-up snaps of her new man.</p>

      <p>Recently, she confessed she is worried about running out of time to have kids.</p>
      <p>"I've kind of always put work first. Wake up in the morning, go to work, come home — just like my boyfriend has," she told Kathy Burke's All Woman show.</p>
      <p>"I'm scared it's going to get too late where I've wanted to go, 'Right, maybe slow down, think about having kids and maybe think about settling down,' but I've never had that.</p>
      <p>"I feel guilty for it sometimes, I feel like maybe I'm being selfish."</p>
      <p>Before Lewis, it was The Apprentice star Andrew Brady, who was very briefly her fiancé, and Jack Street, who she moved in with after just eights months before he broke her heart.</p>
