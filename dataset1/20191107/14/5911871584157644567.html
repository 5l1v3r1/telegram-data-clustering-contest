      <p>Rumors of a Smiths reunion began swirling this week after a “trusted source” reportedly told Morrissey fan site <a href="https://www.morrissey-solo.com/threads/the-smiths-to-reunite-for-2020-tour-promoted-by-live-nation.145090/">Morrissey-Solo</a> that “concert industry insiders, not authorized to speak publicly, say concert giant ‘Live Nation’ has won the rights” to a planned tour reuniting Moz with guitarist Johnny Marr. Not so, says guitarist Johnny Marr.</p>
