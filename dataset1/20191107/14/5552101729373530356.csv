深深一鞠躬告別歌壇　費玉清最終場：把握分分秒秒
07 Nov 2019, 14:23 by 陳于嬙, 李鍾泉
出道47年，費玉清在今（7日）晚舉辦最終場《2019告別演唱會》，之後將正式封麥，全面告別歌壇，他不捨說：「謝謝多年來的厚愛，今晚我要把握分分秒秒，好好唱最後一場，用歌聲來謝謝大家。」最後，他深深一鞠躬，告別了舞台。
回溯費玉清的出道歷程，1972年，他參加中視舉辦的《星對星》歌唱比賽，在總決賽時，以一首〈煙雨斜陽〉獲得第四名，之後順利出道，成為中視基本歌星。費玉清熱愛且擅唱老歌，他說：「小時候寫功課，旁邊的收音機就放著老歌，不管是〈鳳凰于飛〉、〈花好月圓〉，對我來說都有點超齡，但我就是喜歡老歌的韻味。」


費玉清因「禁語」，對最終場的倒數，沒有太多情緒起伏。

一句「濃烈一時快、雅淡意味長」，費玉清點出了熱愛老歌所傳達出淡淡的情感，也因愛這餘韻，讓他自認是歌壇裡少數的「清淡派」，一般而言，只因情緒淡容易被邊緣化，他卻是一唱就47年，他說：「每個階段都有不同想法，每個階段都有各自的燦爛。」


費玉清在最末場演唱會，又唱又說，逗趣又感性。

登台前，費玉清因「禁語」，對最終場的倒數，沒有太多情緒起伏，反而是跟他多年的經紀人說：「小哥今天是用生命在唱歌，完美。聲音又亮又高又寬，低音也漂亮，他真的是用命在唱，今天最後一場了，應該是搏命吧！」也透露費玉清退休後勢必寂寞，可以感覺得出費玉清的茫然，卻也只能慢慢適應。
