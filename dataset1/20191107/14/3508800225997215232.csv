《雙職事奉》：撒母耳的母親如何孕育他，使其成為被神揀選跟使用的人？
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是除了哈拿之外，神也曾經在許多不孕婦人身上行大事，像是撒拉、利百加、拉結、以利沙伯等，事實也證明，這些婦女在神的祝福下喜獲麟兒後，最終都撫養出忠心事奉神且與眾不同的孩子—以撒、雅各、約瑟、施洗約翰。



文：孔毅（Roger I. Kung）
開展王權管理的撒母耳
在士師記的三百年歷史裡，實為神允許以色列人從「神權管理」慢慢轉移到「王權管理」的過渡。在這當中，撒母耳扮演了舉足輕重的角色，他既是最後一個士師，也是膏以色列國王的第一人。
本文的討論範疇是在撒母耳記上，講到的是撒母耳的出生、被神揀選，以及如何奉神之命膏了掃羅當第一個王；下一章則是介紹撒母耳所膏的第二個王——大衛。
如同俗語所說，「每個成功的男人背後，都有一個偉大的女人。」撒母耳背後那個偉大的女人，正是他的母親——哈拿。因此在解析撒母耳這個人之前，我們先來看他的母親是如何孕育撒母耳，使其最終能成長為被神揀選跟使用的人，同時具備了士師、先知、祭司的身份。
撒母耳的生命推手——慈母手中線的哈拿
原先的哈拿，是一個不孕婦女。雖然撒母耳的父親以利加拿，愛哈拿甚過於另一個妻子毗尼拿，但因毗尼拿看哈拿膝下無子，加上爭寵失敗，所以屢次對哈拿冷嘲熱諷。
哈拿心裡甚為愁苦，便在某次獻祭後向神祈求：
萬軍之耶和華啊！ 你若垂顧婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，賜我一個兒子，我必使他終身歸於耶和華，不用剃頭刀剃他的頭。（撒上1:11）
神應允了哈拿的禱告，讓她順利懷孕並且產下一子，名為「撒母耳」，意思就是：「這是我從耶和華那裡求來的」。
撒母耳誕生之後，哈拿始終沒有忘記「把撒母耳歸給神」的承諾。哺育撒母耳到斷奶，哈拿就備齊了三隻公牛，一伊法細麵，一皮袋酒，帶著撒母耳來到耶和華的殿中，交給祭司以利、作為他的老師，往後就由以利來教導撒母耳。
以時間長度來度量，哈拿把撒母耳獻給神之後，母子倆相處的時間並不多，但哈拿用母愛為撒母耳編織出的袍衣，卻是綿延不盡。


生命的外袍


如同所有的母親都必須歷經辛苦懷胎十個月，以及生產過程中的劇烈陣痛，方能孕育出一個新生命。撒母耳亦是披戴上母親所賜的生命外袍，方能有機會來到這個世界上，並且立足於天地間。


慈愛的外袍


利用一年一度的獻祭機會，到了耶和華位於示羅的殿中，哈拿都會為撒母耳送上一件自己縫製的外袍，讓撒母耳穿上之後，可以感覺到母愛的擁抱和同在。如此的細膩用心，也難怪有人會形容母愛最接近神的愛，也有人說正因為上帝太愛我們，才會在每個家庭當中預備一個母親的角色，作為衪的代理人。


教養的外袍


撒母耳尚未成形時，哈拿便向神禱告說要將孩子獻於神，得知懷孕之後亦是如此預備心，顯見撒母耳打從在哈拿的肚子裡，就開始感受到這樣的「胎教」。撒母耳斷奶以前，哈拿的敬虔態度也對他產生潛移默化的效果。撒母耳斷奶後，哈拿依約將他歸於耶和華，更是展示了令人欽佩的身教。
哈拿讓我們見識到，一個偉大母親的行事樣貌應該為何。況且整體而言，神賦予母親跟父親的角色和任務本為不同。
創世紀第3章記載，夏娃在蛇的引誘下，偕同亞當偷吃了知善惡樹上面的果子，神因為他們的不信，而預言了他們及其後代：
又對女人說：我必多多加增你懷胎的苦楚，你生產兒女必多受苦楚。你必戀慕你丈夫，你丈夫必管轄你。又對亞當說：你既聽從妻子的話，吃了我所吩咐你不可吃的那樹上的果子，地必為你的緣故受咒詛；你必終身勞苦才能從地裡得吃的。（創3:16-17）
從這話便可以看出，神是要父親負責養家、母親負責顧家；從現實層面上，我們也看到，父親在家中通常是一個公義的代表，母親則是一個慈愛的代表；在教導子女方面，父親著重的是人生方向的教導，母親是生活教養的教導。這都在在顯明了，多數時候，母親與孩子的生命比較貼近。
再加上孩子在出世以前，早就與母親生死相依地共處十個月。因此孩子與母親較為親密，相較於父親，母親也比較會時時念慕孩子。這也就是為什麼，母親帶孩子時，注意力都放在孩子身上、以孩子為中心，多數父親則是以自己要做的事情為主。
另外我們也可以看到，除了哈拿之外，神也曾經在許多不孕婦人身上行大事，像是撒拉、利百加、拉結、以利沙伯等，事實也證明，這些婦女在神的祝福下喜獲麟兒後，最終都撫養出忠心事奉神且與眾不同的孩子—以撒、雅各、約瑟、施洗約翰。
撒母耳的屬靈老師——尊兒為大的以利
哈拿把撒母耳送到聖殿，以當時的祭司以利為撒母耳的老師。以利也是神揀選的士師，卻教子無方，竟然違反神旨意，讓兩個惡棍兒子擔任祭司，褻瀆神職工作。
而且他的兩個兒子，屢次以祭司之名為所欲為、橫行霸道。不僅屢次派僕人從以色列百姓的手中，奪走給神的肉類祭物，還跟在會幕門前伺候的婦女發生性行為。年邁體衰的以利，雖然從百姓口中聽聞兒子們的惡行，卻也只是出言相勸，並未採取具體的制裁行動。
一日，神派使者來責備以利說：
我所吩咐獻在我居所的祭物，你們為何踐踏？ 尊重你的兒子過於尊重我，將我民以色列所獻美好的祭物肥己呢？ 因此⋯⋯決不容你們這樣行。因為尊重我的，我必重看他。藐視我的，他必被輕視。（撒上2:29-30）
以利竟然尊重孩子勝過於尊重神，這是一個很重要的提醒，值得我們進一步深思。尤其是，現代人孩子普遍生得少，常常教養出自我中心的孩子，對孩子唯命是從。殊不知身為信徒的我們，若是不曾把神的道教導給孩子，便是把孩子視為比神重要。
日子必到，我要折斷你的膀臂和你父家的膀臂，使你家中沒有一個老年人⋯⋯我必不從我壇前滅盡你家中的人；那未滅的必使你眼目乾癟、心中憂傷。你家中所生的人都必死在中年。（撒上2:31-33）
此後，神變得甚少對以利說話，轉而親近年幼的撒母耳。這也告訴我們說，愛的反義詞不是恨，而是冷漠，因為恨一個人代表還有情感上的付出，但冷漠就意味著真的都不管了。所以父母對孩子所能做的最大懲罰，就是用行動宣示「我再也不管你了」。
當神開始親近撒母耳時，撒母耳還不認識神，以至於在睡夢中聽見有人呼喚他的名，以為以利在叫他，還跑去問以利找他有什麼事？ 以利也被問得一頭霧水，直到第三次，以利才意識到是神想對撒母耳說話，便要他留意聆聽。
結果，撒母耳聽見了神默示：
我指著以利家所說的話，到了時候，我必始終應驗在以利身上。我曾告訴他必永遠降罰與他的家，因他知道兒子作孽，自招咒詛，卻不禁止他們。所以我向以利家起誓說：以利家的罪孽，雖獻祭奉禮物，永不能得贖去。（撒上3:12-14）
隔天一早，撒母耳擔心以利聽了會不高興，如常打理殿中的事情，不敢提起隻字片語。反倒是以利，知道神昨晚必然是要透過撒母耳講述關於他的事，便要求撒母耳據實以告。聽完轉述，竟說出「這是出於耶和華，願祂憑自己的意旨而行」（撒上3:18）的輕慢或無奈的話語。
為什麼以利面對往後整個家族都將遭害，仍絲毫沒有悔改的行動，也沒有要跟神求赦免的意思呢？ 那是因為神「使」以利的心剛硬，如同早年也曾使埃及法老的心剛硬一般。
出埃及記當中記載，神為了讓以色列人可以順利離開埃及，透過摩西在法老面前行了十個神蹟，前七次行神蹟，是法老自己的心剛硬，到了第八次之後，就變成是神「使」法老的心剛硬。
如同冷漠所傳達的態度，當父母「任憑」孩子去做一些犯罪的事情時，亦是一種「我不再管你了」的意思。因此「神使人的心剛硬」的這件事情，身為當代信徒的我們，務必要引以為戒，神既是施慈愛也是行公義，若是我們犯了罪卻執意不改，那麼神就未必會無限上綱的給予機會。
人心亦會隨著犯罪次數的加增，漸而麻木不仁。以一塊白布來形容，未犯罪以前，人的心就猶如一塊白布。爾後，每犯一次罪，白布上就會多一個紅點，若不及時消除那紅點，紅點越多，痛悔的程度就越低，終至無感或是變得沒有羞恥心。所以提醒信徒千萬不要悔而不改，免得心越來越剛硬（或神使你的心變剛硬），那就連回轉的機會都沒有了。
自此，神的靈也不再與以利同在，加上當時以色列人的心已遠離神，自然神也就不在約櫃之中。有次，以色列人跟非利士人打仗，抬出約櫃，希望藉由神的同在來打勝仗，不料卻兵敗如山倒，約櫃還被非利士人奪去。唯神仍看顧這件外證之物，在神的神蹟作為下，最後還是回到以色列人手中。
戰爭過程中，以利一直守在城門口等消息，以為神會透過約櫃幫助以色列人打贏，沒想到最後卻接到戰敗的壞消息。更令以利難以接受的是，他的兩個兒子也戰死了，應了神曾說他的兩個兒子會一日同死，並且神的約櫃也被擄去，一得知此，以利在驚嚇中後倒，折斷頸項而終。
可能有信徒會不解，以色列人都已經把約櫃請到軍營了，為什麼還是被殺三萬人、被非利士人打得毫無回手之力？ 我想很重要的一個原因就是，神希望藉此教訓以色列百姓，讓他們知道：若沒有神的實質同在，約櫃也不過是一個外在的形式，不具任何效力。
神重視一個人的信仰心態，勝過於宗教形式。身為信徒的我們，不要以為只要把聖經或是十字架帶在身邊當護身符，神就隨時同在，主要還是要看你跟神的關係是否親近。
撒母耳膏的第一個王——合人心意的掃羅
撒母耳斷奶後就被哈拿送到聖殿中，神喜愛他，經常親自對他說話。長大之後，撒母耳同時肩負了先知、祭司、士師的重責大任，堪稱是所有士師中最完美的一個，至少聖經未記載他做過什麼錯事。
以利在世時，以色列人一再敗給非利士人，連約櫃也一度被擄去。神及時興起撒母耳，先是要他除去以色列百姓信仰的外邦神和亞斯他錄、巴力，使以色列全家都歸向耶和華。隨後又協助掃羅帶領以色列人打勝仗，收回所有被占領的城邑，非利士人從此不敢再入侵，可見成事是在於耶和華。
撒母耳年老之際，曾想立自己的兩個兒子當士師，卻被以色列的眾長老拒絕，原因是「他兒子不行他的道、貪圖財利、收受賄賂、屈枉正直。」（撒上8:3）而且比起士師，眾長老更希望撒母耳為他們立一個王。神要撒母耳叫長老們想清楚，一旦立了個王，百姓們可能會被奴役，但眾長老仍希望如此行。撒母耳便在神的指示下，膏立便雅憫支派的掃羅，作為以色列的第一個王。
掃羅同時也是合人心意的王——健壯、俊美、高大，幾乎占盡一切身為「人」的外在條件優勢。再加上，起初掃羅還懷抱著敬畏神的心志，神就使他戰無不勝、攻無不克，在外人眼中看來，他幾乎就是一個贏在起跑點的人，令人稱羨。
但又是為什麼，後來的掃羅會輸在拐點，終至被神拔掉王者的位份呢？


原因一：在吉甲時，因信心不足，而犯下僭越祭司之職份。撒母耳記第13章記載，掃羅成為以色列王的第二年，帶著以色列人到吉甲爭戰。


撒母耳曾事先交代要掃羅在吉甲等候七天，等神的時候一到，身為祭司的撒母耳就會前去獻燔祭和平安祭。不料到了第七日，掃羅眼見百姓紛紛散去，非利士人步步逼近，心急之餘便擅自獻祭。獻完燔祭，撒母耳就抵達，斥責掃羅的同時，也預告因為他不遵守神吩咐，神將另立他人為王。


原因二：在殺滅亞瑪力人之後，因貪心，故意違命，憐惜了亞瑪力王亞甲，又保留了那上好的牛、羊，並將一切美物歸為己有。


撒母耳記第15章記載，撒母耳按照神的吩咐，命令掃羅帶兵攻剿亞瑪力人，且務必趕盡殺絕、不留任何活口。掃羅雖聽命照做，卻因聽信百姓建議，留下上好的牛羊，假稱為獻祭的物品，同時因為心軟，沒有照著神的吩咐把亞瑪力王殺死。
撒母耳一到，雖然及時殺了亞瑪力王，但亞瑪力王懷孕的妻子已經逃走，其後產下一子—那人便是五百多年後，在波斯地要致以色全族於死地的敵人哈曼的祖先。身為人類的我們哪裡能意識到，一次的不順服便為後代在日後帶來這麼大的災難，而此舉亦再度引發神的不悅，透過撒母耳告訴掃羅，已經厭棄他作為以色列的王。
在那之後，撒母耳奉神的指示，前去找一位名為耶西（大衛的父親）的伯利恆人，並且膏立他的小兒子大衛為王，神的靈從此與大衛同在。反觀掃羅，因為神的靈離去，開始受到惡魔攪擾，正如同一個人遠離了主，就會有世界上的事情來打擾，使他失去了以往的平安。掃羅的僕人見狀，找來擅長彈琴的大衛，為掃羅紓解心裡的空虛愁煩，使惡魔離開了他，大衛也因此很得掃羅的喜愛。
兩人關係甚篤，一直到了後來大衛打死非利士的巨人歌利亞，凱旋回來時，婦女們唱著：「掃羅殺死千千，大衛殺死萬萬。」掃羅心生妒忌，自此千方百計想置大衛於死地。交手過程中，大衛兩度可以殺死掃羅，卻沒有這麼做，也沒有因為自知即將要取代掃羅為王，而擅自作主替神先除掉掃羅，此亦顯示了大衛對神的尊重。
明知大衛兩次放他生路，掃羅卻還是鐵了心要追殺大衛。最終因為去找交鬼的婦人，一錯再錯得罪神，導致隔日就與三個兒子一同戰死的結局。
綜觀掃羅從「贏在起點」到「輸在拐點」的歷程，其靈性及扭轉五力的破產，早已有跡可循。


靈性的破產（屬靈）



不信神：如同我們偶爾會在教會裡看到，有些人會受洗是因為家人信神，所以自己也信神（卻不真的認識神），掃羅信的也是撒母耳的神，每次只要遇到事情就拉住撒母耳，從未自己跟神禱告過，或是親自求告神的印證。
輕看罪：從掃羅與撒母耳的對話可以看見，掃羅是一個勇於認罪的人，然卻死不悔改，而且從不為自己犯的罪負責，總是推卸給他人，或是以向神獻祭之名義，來合理化自己的私心。
不順服：以擊殺亞瑪力人的事件為例，掃羅從撒母耳那邊明明得知，神要其格殺勿論，掃羅卻明知故犯，擺明犯下悖逆和頑硬的罪。



扭轉力破產（屬世）



眼力：作戰時只知墨守成規、拒絕變化，一味蠻幹，因而毫無過人戰術可言。
魅力：位居高位卻害怕部屬比自己強，進而追殺大衛，有失領導者風範。
動力：除了兒子約拿單主動追隨，對於他人都得靠王者權威來驅動行事。
魄力：生性懼怕、不敢冒險，加上毫無膽識，以至於受制於民和受制於敵。
德力：以怨報德，明知大衛兩次放他生路，卻又執意追殺對方。

""Double duty ministry"": How did Samuel's mother breed him to become a person chosen and used by God?
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that in addition to Hannah, God has done great things in many infertile people, such as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Elizabeth, and the facts prove that these women are in God. After blessing the joy of Lin Lin, they eventually raised the children who were faithful to serve God and made a difference - Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, John the Baptist.



Text: Roger I. Kung
Samuel who manages the royal power
In the three hundred years of the Judges' history, God has allowed the Israelis to slowly move from ""the management of theocracy"" to the transition to the ""manship management."" Among them, Samuel played a pivotal role. He was the last judge and the first person to anoint the king of Israel.
The scope of this article is in Samuel, about the birth of Samuel, the choice of God, and how to anoint Saul as the first king by the command of God; the next chapter is about the second of Samuel's cream. King - David.
As the saying goes, ""There is a great woman behind every successful man."" The great woman behind Samuel is his mother, Hannah. Therefore, before analyzing Samuel, let us first see how his mother gave birth to Samuel, so that he could eventually grow into a person chosen and used by God, and possess the status of a judge, a prophet, or a priest.
Samuel's life pusher - Hannah in the hands of the mother
The original Hannah was an infertile woman. Although Samuel's father, Elkanah, loved Hannah to be more than another wife, Peninnah, but because of Peninna's view of Hannah's knees without a child, and the failure of the pet, he repeatedly sneered at Hannah.
Hannah was very bitter in her heart, and prayed to God after a sacrifice:
Lord of armies! If you look down on the bitterness of the prostitute, and remember not forgetting the prostitute, and giving me a son, I will make him to the Lord for life, shaving his head without a razor. (sprinkled 1:11)
God answered Hannah's prayer and made her pregnant and gave birth to a child named ""Samuel"", which means: ""This is what I asked from the Lord.""
After the birth of Samuel, Hannah never forgot the promise of ""delivering Samuel to God."" Feeding Samuel to weaning, Hannah prepared three bulls, a fine dish of Ipha, a bag of wine, and came to the temple of the Lord with Samuel, and gave it to the priest Eli as his teacher. Eli came to teach Samuel.
Measured by the length of time, after Hannah gave Samuel to God, the mother and the son did not spend much time together, but Hannah used her mother's love to sew the robes of Samuel, but it was not extended.


Robe of life


Just as all mothers have to work hard for ten months, and the intense pains in the production process, they can give birth to a new life. Samuel also wore a life robes given by her mother to have the opportunity to come to this world and to stand on the ground.


Loving robe


Taking advantage of the annual sacrifice opportunity, when the Lord is in the temple of Shiloh, Hannah will give Samuel a self-sewed robe, so that when Samuel is put on, he can feel the embrace and presence of maternal love. With such delicate care, it is no wonder that some people will describe the love of maternal love closest to God. Others say that because God loves us too much, we will prepare a mother's role in each family as an agent of blasphemy.


Raised robe


When Samuel was not formed, Hannah prayed to God that she would give her children to God. She learned that after pregnancy, she also prepared her heart. It was obvious that Samuel had been in the belly of Hannah and began to feel such ""prenatal education."" Before Samuel was weaned, Hannah’s godly attitude also had a subtle effect on him. After Samuel was weaned, Hannah gave him the Lord, and showed his admirable teaching.
Hannah let us see why a great mother should behave. Moreover, on the whole, God has given the mother and father the same role and mission.
In the third chapter of Genesis, Eve was tempted by the serpent to sneak out the fruit of the tree of knowledge and evil, and God predicted them and their descendants because of their unbelief:
And said to the woman: I will increase the suffering of your pregnancy, and you will suffer more from the production of your children. You will love your husband, and your husband will rule over you. And he said to Adam, ""You have obeyed the words of your wife, and ate the fruit of the tree that I commanded you not to eat, and the earth will be cursed for your sake; you will have labor for life to eat from the earth."" (Gen 3:16-17)
From this point of view, it can be seen that God wants the father to be responsible for raising the family and the mother responsible for the family. On the practical level, we also see that the father is usually a representative of justice at home, and the mother is a representative of kindness; teaching children In terms of the father's emphasis on the direction of life, the mother is the teaching of life education. This is showing up, most of the time, the mother and the child's life is closer.
Plus, before the child was born, he had been living with his mother for 10 months. Therefore, the child is more intimate with the mother, and the mother is more likely to admire the child than the father. This is why, when the mother takes the child, the attention is placed on the child, the child is the center, and most fathers are mainly doing what they want to do.
In addition, we can also see that in addition to Hannah, God has done great things in many infertile people, such as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Elizabeth, and the facts prove that these women are in God. After blessing the joy of Lin Lin, they eventually raised the children who were faithful to serve God and made a difference - Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, John the Baptist.
Samuel's spiritual teacher - John the Great
Hannah sent Samuel to the temple, and the then priest Eli was the teacher of Samuel. Eli is also the chosen teacher of God, but the teachings are incompetent, and they actually violate the will of God and let the two villains sons serve as priests and work in the ministry.
Moreover, his two sons repeatedly used the name of the priest to do whatever they want. Not only did the servants repeatedly take away the meat sacrifices from God in the hands of the Israelites, but they also had sex with the women who served in front of the tabernacle. Eli, who was old and weak, although he heard the bad behavior of his sons from the mouth of the people, he only spoke out and did not take specific sanctions.
One day, God sent messengers to blame Eli:
Why did you trample on the sacrifices that I commanded to offer in my residence? Respect your son to respect me too much, and to give me a good sacrifice from my people Israel? Therefore, you will not be allowed to do this. Because I respect him, I will look at him. Despising me, he will be despised. (Spread 2:29-30)
Eli even respects the child to win over respecting God. This is a very important reminder and deserves further consideration. In particular, modern children generally have fewer children, and often teach self-centered children, and they are obedient to their children. As we are not aware of, as a believer, if we have never taught the Word of God to our children, we regard the child as more important than God.
The days will come, and I will break your arm and the arm of your father's house, so that there is not an old man in your house, and I will not destroy all the people in your house from my altar; the undead will make your eyes dry, Sad in my heart. Everyone born in your family will die in middle age. (1 Sam 2:31-33)
Since then, God has become less talkative to Eli and turned to the young Samuel. This also tells us that the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference, because hate one person represents emotional effort, but indifference means that it really does not matter. So the biggest punishment parents can do for their children is to use action to declare ""I don't care about you anymore.""
When God began to get close to Samuel, Samuel did not know God, so that in his sleep he heard someone calling his name, thinking that Eli was calling him, and ran to ask Eli to find him. Eli was also asked to be confused, until the third time, Eli realized that God wanted to speak to Samuel, and he wanted him to pay attention to listening.
As a result, Samuel heard the inspiration of God:
I pointed to what Eli said, and by then, I will always be fulfilled in Eli. I told him that he would be fined with his home forever, because he knew that his son was guilty, he cursed himself, but he did not ban them. Therefore, I swear to the Eli family that the sins of the Eli family, though offering sacrifices, can never be redeemed. (1 Sam. 3:12-14)
The next morning, Samuel worried that Eli would be unhappy when he heard it. If he used to take care of the things in the temple, he would not dare to mention a word. Instead, Eli, knowing that God had to tell Samuel about him last night, asked Samuel to tell the truth. After listening to the retelling, he said, ""This is out of the Lord, and may he walk by his own will"" (1 Sam. 3:18).
Why did Eli face the entire family in the future, and there is still no repentance, and there is no intention to ask God for forgiveness? That is because God's ""making"" Eli's heart is hard, as early as the early days, the heart of the Egyptian Pharaoh was hardened.
In Exodus, it is recorded that in order to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt smoothly, God has performed ten miracles in front of Pharaoh through Moses. The first seven miracles were made by Pharaoh’s own heart. After the eighth time, It became the heart of God to ""make"" Pharaoh hard.
As the attitude conveyed by indifference, when parents ""allow"" the child to do some crimes, it is also a kind of ""I no longer care about you."" Therefore, the ""God makes the heart harder"". As a contemporary believer, we must take the precepts. God is both merciful and righteous. If we commit sin but insist on not changing, then God will It is not necessarily an opportunity to give infinitely.
The human heart will gradually become insensitive with the increase in the number of crimes. Described as a piece of white cloth, before the crime, the human heart is like a white cloth. Afterwards, every time you commit a crime, there will be a red dot on the white cloth. If you do not eliminate the red dot in time, the more red dots, the lower the degree of contrite, and the endless feeling or become shameless. So remind the believers not to repent and not change, lest the heart become harder and harder (or God makes your heart harder), then there is no chance of turning.
Since then, the Spirit of God has ceased to be with Eli, and the hearts of the Israelites have been far from God, and the natural God is not in the Ark. On one occasion, the Israelites fought with the Philistines and carried out the ark of the covenant, hoping to win the battle with God's presence, but the defeat was defeated, and the ark was taken away by the Philistines. Only God still cares about this foreign evidence, under the miracle of God, and finally returns to the hands of the Israelites.
During the war, Eli kept keeping the news at the gate of the city, thinking that God would help the Israelites to win through the ark, but did not expect to receive the bad news of the defeat. What is even more unacceptable to Eli is that his two sons also died in battle. It was said that God had said that his two sons would die the same day, and that the ark of God was also taken away. Eli fell in the middle of the fright and broke the neck.
There may be believers who will not understand. The Israelites have already invited the ark to the military camp. Why are they still being killed by 30,000 people and being beaten by the Philistines? One reason I think is very important is that God wants to learn from the Israeli people and let them know that without the essence of God, the ark is nothing but an external form and has no effect.
God values one's belief in mind and is better than religious form. As believers, don't think that as long as you bring the Bible or the cross to your side as amulets, God will always be there, mainly depending on whether your relationship with God is close.

After Samuel was weaned, he was sent to the temple by Hannah. God loved him and often spoke to him personally. When he grew up, Samuel also shouldered the responsibility of the prophets, priests, and judges. It was the most perfect of all the judges. At least the Bible did not record what he had done wrong.
When Eli was alive, the Israelites were repeatedly defeated to the Philistines, and even the Ark of the Covenant was once taken captive. God raised Samuel in time, first asking him to remove the Gentile gods and the Ashtar and the Baal of the people of Israel, and to bring the whole family of Israel to the Lord. Later, he assisted Saul in leading the Israelites to victory and to take back all the occupied cities. The Philistines never dared to invade again. It is obvious that the Lord is in the Lord.
When Samuel was old, he wanted to establish his two sons as judges, but he was rejected by the elders of Israel. ""The reason is that his son can't do his own way, be profitable, accept bribes, and succumb to integrity."" 8:3) And compared to the judges, the elders hope that Samuel will establish a king for them. God wants Samuel to call the elders to think clearly. Once a king is established, the people may be enslaved, but the elders still hope to do so. At the direction of God, Samuel anointed Saul of the tribe of Benjamin as the first king of Israel.
Saul is also the king of the people's minds - strong, handsome, tall, almost occupying all the external conditions that are ""people."" In addition, at first Saul was still holding the fear of God, and God made him invincible and invincible. In the eyes of outsiders, he was almost a winner at the starting point, which is commendable.
But why is it that the subsequent Saul will lose at the turning point and eventually be removed from the position of the king by God?


Reason one: In Gilgal, due to lack of confidence, he committed the duties of the priest. In the 13th chapter of Samuel, Saul became the second year of the king of Israel, and he took the Israelites to fight in Gilgal.


Samuel had previously stated that Saul had been waiting for seven days in Gilgal, and when he was waiting for God, Samuel, who was a priest, went to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. Unexpectedly, on the seventh day, Saul saw the people scatter, and the Philistines approached step by step, and they sacrificed themselves without urgency. After the sacrifice of the burnt offering, Samuel arrived and rebuked Saul. He also warned that because he did not obey God's command, God would make others king.


Reason 2: After killing the Amalekites, due to greed, deliberately disobeying, pity the Amadea king, and retain the good cows and sheep, and attribute all the good things to their own.


In the 15th chapter of Samuel, Samuel ordered, according to God's command, Saul to bring troops to attack the Amalekites, and to kill them without leaving any living. Although Saul took orders to do it, he listened to the suggestions of the people, left good cattle and sheep, and faked the items of sacrifice. At the same time, because of his soft heart, he did not kill the king of Amalek according to God's command.
When Samuel arrived, although he killed the king of Amalek in time, the pregnant wife of Amalie Wang had fled, and then he gave birth to a child. That person was more than five hundred years later, in the Persian land to be the best of the color. The ancestors of Harman, the enemy of the dead. As human beings, we can realize that once disobedience will bring such a great disaster to future generations, and this move will once again trigger God's dissatisfaction, telling Saul through Samuel that he has rejected him as the king of Israel. .
After that, Samuel was instructed by God to go to a Bethlehem named Jesse (David's father) and anoint his little son David to be king. The Spirit of God has been with David since then. . In contrast, Saul, because the Spirit of God has left, began to be disturbed by the devil, just as the same person is far from the Lord, there will be things in the world to disturb, causing him to lose the peace of the past. When Saul's servant saw it, he found David, who was good at playing the piano, to relieve Saul's emptiness in his heart, and let the demon leave him. David was so much like Saul's favorite.
The relationship between the two was so great that David had killed the Philistine giant Goliath. When the triumph came back, the women sang: ""Saul killed thousands, and David killed tens of thousands."" Saul was jealous. Since then, I have tried every means to set David to death. During the fight, David could kill Saul twice, but he did not do this. He did not know that he was about to replace Saul as a king. He did not take the initiative to remove Saul for God. This also shows David. Respect for God.
Knowing that David had let him live for two times, Saul was still eager to chase David. In the end, because she went to find a woman who had been married, she mistakenly sinned God, leading to the end of the battle with her three sons on the next day.
Looking at Saul's journey from ""winning at the starting point"" to ""losing at the turning point"", its spirituality and reversal of the bankruptcy of the five forces have long been traced.


Spiritual bankruptcy (spiritual)



Do not believe in God: as we occasionally see in the church, some people will be baptized because their family believes in God, so they also believe in God (but don't really know God). Saul's letter is also the god of Samuel. When you get to Samuel, you have never prayed with God, or you have asked for the testimony of God.
Look down on sin: From the dialogue between Saul and Samuel, Saul is a man who is daring to confess, but he does not repent, and he is never responsible for his own sins, always shirking to others, or to God. In the name of sacrifice, to rationalize your own selfishness.
Disobedience: Take the case of killing the Amalekites as an example. Saul knew from Samuel that God wanted to kill him, but Saul knew it and made a sin of rebellion and stubbornness.



Torsion of bankruptcy (worldly)



Eyesight: In combat, I only know how to stick to the rules, refuse to change, and ruthlessly, so there is no tactical.
Charm: Being in a high position, but fearing that the subordinates are stronger than themselves, and then chasing David, there is a loss of leadership style.
Motivation: In addition to the son Jonathan actively follow, for others to rely on the authority of the king to drive.
魄力: Sexual fear, not afraid to take risks, and without courage, so that they are subject to the people and subject to the enemy.
Deli: With resentment, knowing that David had let him go, he insisted on chasing each other.

Life is faith, work is mission


How do the ""jobs"" of personal work and the ""positions"" of national missions combine? How does the future development of the church go from ""inside the wall to outside the wall""? ""Wall to wall?"" From the work of the ""key moments"" of 16 great men of confidence to the life-torsing power of ""definition moments"", this book highlights the new and different situations in God and their covenants. The 16 case studies in this book are the best examples of workplace education.

The author of this book, Mr. Kong Yi, is an important entrepreneur in the scientific and technological circles and a devout Christian. Forty years of experience in the workplace, in the ""critical moment"" of life, the decision to go up or down, or in a special situation, the final ""presentation moment"" of what kind of person he is, Mr. Kong Yi in the Bible I found an example of learning.
The biblical characters introduced in this book accept God's call when they are in trouble, reversing their own lives in the interaction with God, and at the same time completing God's plan and changing history! In contrast to today's life and work, Mr. Kong Yi's ""reversing the five forces"" (power, eyesight, charm, courage, and deli) extracted from the workplace's tempering, also find each other in the life course of the Bible characters. The presentation of the radiance. This book is the essence of Mr. Kong Yi's reading notes for decades.
This book takes 16 Bible characters as a model, focusing on ""the work of the critical moments of twisting power"" and ""defining the life of the moment"" to explore how they respond to God's call in their respective environments (workplaces), and then find the destiny, mission accomplished. There is also how they humble and obey God's leadership in the critical moments of their work and the definition of life, and fulfill the mission of God.
The most special feature of this book is to describe the biblical characters ""taking the workplace as the field"" and complete the core principles and values of workplace education at each stage. From their experience, the church now truly understands the urgency of ""dual duty ministry"". Inspire the believers in the workplace not only to enjoy the dedication in the church wall on the main day, but also to achieve excellence, glory and benefit in the workplace outside the wall, and to live more faith.
At the same time, workplace education will also be the work concept of Christians in the 21st century - a godly way of integrating faith into work and truly uniting with life.
