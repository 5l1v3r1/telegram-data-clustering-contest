      <p>Three-quarters of a million poppies are to be dropped over the White Cliffs of Dover in an emotional tribute to the fallen for Remembrance Day.</p>
      <p>An original second world war Dakota aircraft will fly over the landmark at exactly 11am GMT on Sunday, flanked by two Spitfires.</p>
      <p>As the nation falls silent, the Dakota will soar above the Kent countryside to mark 74 years since the end of the second world war.</p>
      <p>Veterans from several conflicts, including the second world war, Northern Ireland, Iraq and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>, will signal the drop from on board the Dakota as the formation reaches the sky above the cliffs.</p>
      <p>The event is the brainchild of Kent-based Aero Legends, with proceeds going to the annual Poppy Appeal.<br/>Aero Legends, managing director Ben Perkins said: "Commemorations like this are incredibly important to remember those who fought and continue to fight for our freedom."</p>
      <p>The bio-degradable poppies will be dropped at exactly 11am GMT on Remembrance Sunday above the Battle of Britain War Memorial next to the White Cliffs.</p>
      <p>The aircraft will fly past at an altitude of just 500 feet (152.4 metres) and a team of volunteers will ensure the poppies are cleared up after the ceremony.</p>
      <p>The sight of three original second <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/world-war.html">world war</a> aircraft dropping the poppies is sure to provide a moving tribute to those who fought, and continue to fight, for their country.</p>
      <p>The Dakota will carry five veterans, including three former RAF men who served during the second world war.</p>
      <p>The battle-scarred aircraft - known to its crew at the time as "Drag 'Em Oot" - is itself a veteran of the conflict and took part in the troop drops on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-day-landings-190605180238052.html">D-Day</a>.</p>
      <p>It still has 40 bullet holes in its fuselage dating back to those battles.</p>
