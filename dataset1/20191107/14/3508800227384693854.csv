《用書脫魯的一生閱讀術》：國際移動力——你的未來在世界旅行中找到

我們想讓你知道的是如果你把國際移動當成把自己換到陌生空間短暫生活或工作，那你就誤解國際移動力的意義。有人說： 不要天真地想著透過旅行來改變自己的狀態，能改變你的，不是風景，而是經歷。

國際移動力：你的未來在世界旅行中找到
「我可以適應全球就業的新時代？」「全球化時代，如何培養國際移動力？」「我能成為適性揚才的世界公民？」怡慧tips：「旅行是另類的閱讀，讓你在世界的地圖找到生命的地標。」
有次在上完《裨海紀遊》的課程後，我們開始討論三百年前郁永河來臺採硫，事後寫了一本來臺的所見所聞。郁永河因《裨海紀遊》名留歷史，被譽為臺灣的大旅行家， 臺灣遊記文學的開創者， 堪稱臺灣國際移動力的先驅。接著，我以《享受吧！一個人的旅行》的西方小說作東西國際移動的主題探索，一位女性如何從失去自我透過一個人的旅行，慢慢找回愛人與被愛的能力。兩個人國際移動的目的不同，獲得的結果也不同。說穿了，旅行某種程度是卡繆說的：「旅行幫助我們找回自己。」繞了一圈，常常發現：出走有時候是追尋未來與逃避現實的一體兩面，這和閱讀有相似的地方都在為困惑找答案。
然而，一趟旅行能夠帶給你生命的答案嗎？
全球化時代來臨，我們很難只在一個地方生活或是工作。更多的可能是雲林科技大學校長楊能舒說的：未來人才隨自己的專業能力，因地制宜，找到最適合發揮的地點、場域應徵，向全世界成功行銷自己。
那麼，國際移動力又是什麼？陳超明教授認為的：全球化不僅是資源的全球利用，更重要的是人才的流動，未來國際移動力的關鍵在具備國際視野的專業能力；流暢的語言溝通力；跨文化的思維；適應生活的能力。
因此，對以上四個指標為大家推薦十本適合增強國際移動力的書籍，讓你從離開與回歸之間，找到與世界接軌的競爭力。
移動力讓腦袋進行靜態革命
作家洪震宇與搭檔游智維認為： 或許旅行結束後， 世界不會因此而改變，但重要的是，我們的腦袋變了，世界從此變得不一樣。旅行的意義不在目的地是哪裡，而在於過程中遇見的人與在他們身上發生的故事。能滲透人心、跨越人與人之間藩籬的溫暖故事，是洪震宇與游智維所謂「旅行」的核心。連志展在《勇氣，在山盡頭》提到：登山從來都不是為了征服山，而是為了征服自己內心的軟弱。在爬的時候，總是可以找到無數的理由告訴自己不要再爬，那要如何在每當想要逃離的時候，讓自己再度找到力量，堅持走下去。踏錯一步是永不復返的凶險，往頂峰接續踏出的腳步，卻是行者不變的堅持與追尋。
對於登山這件看起來很小的事，連志展告訴我們：離開舒適圈前，他做好專業的準備、心理的建設、環境的對話，才能從登山體會到：走過盡頭之後，下一個盡頭之後，又會是什麼風景，從此，不會害怕面對新的未知，更清楚自己對生活、對生命的理解是什麼。因此，真正的國際移動力必須用專業力帶來的腦內靜態的革命，從一次又一次的移動中，帶來一次又一次新價值與新學習的啟動，讓自己越來越接近全球價值。
國際移動讓你換個思考的面向
愛因斯坦說：「持續不斷地用同樣的方法做同一件事情，卻期望得到不同的結果，叫做荒謬！」只有換方法，讓價值觀升級，才有可能破局，走上新局。
所謂「勤奮的懶惰」是常見的勤奮誤區，當你缺乏思考與識見，反而重複又長時間做著同一件事，事實上是徒勞無功的。一如學習，最重要的是找對方法， 幫助學習的歷程。因此把國際移動力視為知識的實踐、文化的理解，會讓思維更開闊。
《可複製的領導力》提到：掌握要領，平凡人也能成為優秀的領導者，如果，團隊在上海，自己一個人在北京生活，如何做到管理與領導？ 在國際移動的時代， 樊登幾乎兩個月才去一次公司， 主要是和CEO以及高層團隊吃個飯， 開個會。他大部分的時間是讀書、養生和旅行。他的團隊主力不超過三十歲，一群從沒有創業和在大公司工作經驗過的年輕人，如何創造每年公司百分之一千的發展速度，更重要的是，他們在工作中獲得快樂！
具有國際移動力的團隊領導人透過認真傾聽，累積「罵人的成本」，建立起與部屬的情感帳戶後，對事不對人，部屬不會輕易生氣上司的建議，反而感覺上司是真心為他好，而非毫無意義的人身攻擊。主管不用緊迫盯人，卻讓員工對他有高黏著力。就像查理．蒙格說，打高爾夫球不能按照自己的本能來打，得學點兒專業技巧。
在國際移動力的時代，一個好的領導人不是死守公司，反而是學會領導的技巧，增進團隊溝通，樊登說：領導人要留意三說。工作製造太多的「不能說」，會讓團隊整日都生活在焦慮和壓力之中。主管常常「忘了說」，會顯示管理者的傲慢，自以為不用說，部屬「應該要知道」的事情，往往是誤解的開端。「不好意思說」的領導，常讓團隊錯失許多機會，也可能造成一些致命的後果。真正的國際移動讓你換個思考的面向，找到更好的方法解決組織內的諸多問題。
移動是遇見返璞歸真的自己
如果你把國際移動當成把自己換到陌生空間短暫生活或工作，那你就誤解國際移動力的意義。有人說： 不要天真地想著透過旅行來改變自己的狀態，能改變你的，不是風景，而是經歷。
以最簡單的旅行來談，一段旅程的時間，改變自己是最浪漫而務實的自我對話。每個人的心裡，都該有個既定的地景，透過移動力遇見真實的自己，陪伴內在的小孩，經歷荒涼反叛的旅行之後找到成熟自信的大人。旅行的陌生感與不確定性，能將生活觀察力放到最大，因為要把慣常的日子過得風生水起，真的不太可能。重新爬梳、充電、重新出發，行旅的過程，你被嶄新的人事時地物觸發，而有所成長。
離開舒適圈是為了遇見另一個自己，而不是花錢買個奢華頹廢的理由，就像Peter Su《如果可以簡單，誰想要複雜》說的：「我熱愛旅行的最大原因，因為你永遠不知道前方有什麼在等著你。」從陌生開始，每個步履成了有機體，落地生根，一步又一步漫地生長。一跨步，世界變得彷彿更開闊、更自由了，當我們不再裹足不前，越過害怕的雷池，會發現百迴千轉之後，你找到一個反璞歸真的自己，勇敢純真地只想簡單地做回小時候帶著夢想前進的自己。
國際移動是華麗的冒險
鍾成虎說，做音樂不要做無所在意的漣漪，要做奮力的石頭，向這個時代投擲一些什麼。要出走，要移動，走屬於自己的路，你的確無前跡可循，卻因為願意移動的情勢，因此把路走得蜿蜒而強壯。願意闖一闖，某種程度是置之死地而後生的膽識，人生短短幾個秋，說真的沒什麼好怕的。帶著一種理想與憧憬出發，你的心境、身體某種程度也獲得自由。陌生的空間，某條街道，某個商店，某個背影，都是你鏈結過往很重要的回望，從移動的剎那，彷彿人生片段被濃縮了。《瞬：陳綺貞歌詞筆記》書摘提到：〈旅行的意義〉是個很深遠的問題：嚮往的地方在哪兒？心中的理想是什麼？想了很久都沒有答案，於是哼出了這樣的旋律。這首歌有很多自己在移動空間當中的回憶... ...
你無法理會或回應世界對我們過多期待，甚至討好。但是，你敢不敢做和別人不一樣的事？這點自信可以透過出走、離開的華麗冒險尋回。
小說家的國際移動力
《你說，寮國到底有什麼？》旅行對一個人的意義以及對於一個作家的意義，到底有什麼不同？村上春樹說：旅行是件好事，雖然會有疲倦，會有失望，但一定也會有什麼。真正的旅行，或許是到了出發的那一刻都在探問自己，走過不同的風景，看過不同人情，我們的生命真能有所改變抑或是頓悟。我發現，有時候為工作而書寫的文字就無法享受忘記工作的快樂，旅行就該讓腦袋一片空白，只享受縱情旅行的樂趣與放鬆。總有那麼一個時刻，靈光乍現剎那，地景與心情交融的悸動，文字串接而起行旅的暢快，沉澱移動時的真實感受， 回歸當下， 當地的生活歷歷在目， 立體鮮活了起來。因此，小說家從國際移動力得到創作的靈感，而我們從單純地享受快樂到以文字記錄吉光片羽的感動，兩者的移動生活同等精彩。
有種國際移動叫流浪
從《轉山》到《走河》，作家在國際移動的另類風采叫流浪。《轉山》所說：「流浪，是為了看看這個世界，能不能用自己希望的方式生活。」當時謝旺霖渴望從流浪看見自己的成長和蛻變，《走河》卻是作家在流浪裡，覺知更多的了悟和割捨。謝旺霖許我們在一個絕然孤獨的時刻，享受一個絕美的浪游，我們學著用旅人漂蕩的觀點，換位看這個世界。而切．格瓦拉，從阿根廷優渥的舒適圈出走，騎著摩托車繞了南美洲一圈，一次一萬二千公里的旅行，完成一位孤獨又高貴靈魂在旅途中，找到自我的成長，還有對理想世界改變的熱情。一如《 革命前夕的摩托車之旅》 所說：「 讓世界改變你，你才能改變世界。」這不也印證Mark 所說的，人的一生要瘋狂一次，無論是為了一個人，一段情，一段旅途，甚至是一個夢想。關於出走，關於國際移動，都是我們一生可以思考與論辨的議題。
在世界地圖上找到自己
公益平臺文化基金會董事長嚴長壽《在世界地圖上找到自己》書中提出的教育觀點，許多思考的方向和黃益中是不謀而合的。他們倆強調自學、體驗， 他們希望學生能運用所學， 透過親身實踐， 產生真實的生活經驗與內在力量，對臺灣教育、文化、經濟、國家競爭力來說，我們都需要會好奇、會懷疑、會思辨、會創造的孩子，而教育的本質無非是讓學生認清自己的定位，不要盲目地陷入某種思考的陷阱中，以反璞歸真的初心，讓學習已經不再侷限在教室內，受制於時間的壓力，能更自在地學習，一如嚴長壽所預言的無校園大學（Minerva School），或許將成為下一波教育改革的新潮流，如果連教育都能在國際移動中學習，就太震撼又吸睛了。
創作是國際移動力的餘韻
「我的眼是康橋教我睜的，我的求知欲是康橋給我撥動的，我的自我的意識是康橋給我胚胎的。」我在《背起文學行囊：造訪英倫名家》的文字中也看到另類的移動力。其中一位作者是二○○一年赴英攻讀博士學位的嚴愛群，背起文學行囊，她帶上一枝art pen、一本手札，透過鏡頭，記錄每一個文學行腳。廖培蓉專攻英國女作家維琴尼亞．伍爾芙的作品，兩位作者聯手打造造訪英倫文學名家的令人驚艷國際移動故事。
你知道倫敦科芬園（CovenGarden） 是蕭伯納《茶花女》 出現的地景、福爾摩斯博物館是柯南道爾創造的奇幻世界、「僧侶屋」（Monk’sHouse）是吳爾芙為女性發聲的謬思所在... ...許多的作品來自於生活，作家願意透過文字讓讀者也進行國際移動的閱讀學習。倫敦腔的英語發音、獵鹿帽、披肩風衣，英倫風情... ...從紙上的召喚到真正移動的歷程，文字的力量，讓即將前往的城市、鄉野，加入更多走過、愛過、沉澱過的想像與嚮往。就像義大利作家安伯托． 艾可（UmbertoEco） 說過的：「 若你堅持要反抗智慧的啟發，那就照舊帶著你的偵探小說出發吧！」
原來，國際移動力，不只是旅行而已，從不同面向我們明白：當自己擁有國際移動力，未來在全世界任何地方都能自處、都能生存。國際移動力不只是一個名詞， 把它視為動詞， 讓你在專業技術能力外， 帶上「 語言」 及「文化」的「軟知識」，「國際移動」的專用標籤就屬於你了。未來是一個能從在地出發，願意發揮所長的時代，期待我們做好準備，帶著競爭力，移動到世界各地，貢獻所用——適才、適性、適所。

""Lifelong Reading with Books"": International Mobility - Your future is found in world travel
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that if you think of international mobility as a short-term life or work in a strange space, then you misunderstand the meaning of international mobility. Some people say: Don't naively think about changing your own state through travel. It can change yours, not scenery, but experience.



Text: Song Yihui
International Mobility: Your future is found in world travel
""Can I adapt to the new era of global employment?"" ""How can we cultivate international mobility in the era of globalization?"" ""Can I become a world citizen of appropriateness and talent?"" Yi Hui tips: ""Travel is an alternative reading that will keep you in the world."" The map finds the landmark of life.""
After finishing the course of ""Bohai Jiyou"", we began to discuss the sulphur extraction from Yuyonghe to Taiwan three hundred years ago. Afterwards, I wrote a story about Taiwan. Known as the great traveler of Taiwan, Yu Yonghe is known as the great traveler of Taiwan and the pioneer of Taiwan's travel literature. He is a pioneer of Taiwan's international mobility. Then, I will enjoy it! The Western Fiction of One's Travel is an exploration of the theme of international mobility. How can a woman slowly recover her lover and be loved by losing herself through a person's journey. The purpose of two people moving internationally is different, and the results obtained are different. To put it bluntly, some degree of travel is what Kathy said: ""Travel helps us find ourselves."" Around a circle, it is often found that leaving is sometimes a two-sided pursuit of the future and escapism, which is similar to reading. They are all looking for answers to confusion.
However, can a trip bring you the answer to your life?
With the advent of globalization, it is difficult for us to live or work in one place. More likely, Yang Nengshu, president of Yunlin University of Science and Technology, said: In the future, talents will adapt to their own professional abilities and adapt to local conditions, find the most suitable location and field application, and successfully market themselves to the world.
So what is international mobility? Professor Chen Chaoming believes that globalization is not only the global use of resources, but more importantly, the flow of talents. The key to international mobility in the future is the professional ability with international vision; smooth language communication; cross-cultural thinking; adapting to life. ability.
Therefore, for the above four indicators, we recommend ten books suitable for enhancing international mobility, so that you can find the competitiveness of connecting with the world from leaving and returning.
Mobility makes the brain a static revolution
Writer Hong Zhenyu and his partner, You Zhiwei believe: Maybe after the end of the trip, the world will not change, but what is important is that our head has changed and the world has become different. The meaning of travel is not where the destination is, but the people who meet in the process and the stories that happen to them. The warm story that can penetrate people's hearts and cross the barriers between people is the core of Hong Zhenyu and You Zhiwei's so-called ""travel."" Lian Zhizhan mentioned in ""Courage, at the end of the mountain"": Mountaineering has never been to conquer the mountains, but to conquer the weakness of one's heart. When you climb, you can always find countless reasons to tell yourself not to climb again. How to make yourself find strength again when you want to escape, and stick to it. Taking a wrong step is the hunger that never returns. It is the constant persistence and pursuit of the walker.
For the seemingly small thing of climbing, Lian Zhizhan told us: Before leaving the comfort zone, he should be professionally prepared, psychologically constructed, and talked about the environment in order to get from the mountaineering experience: after the end, the next one After the end, what kind of scenery will be, from then on, will not be afraid to face new unknowns, more clearly what is their understanding of life and life. Therefore, the true international mobility must use the static revolution in the brain brought about by professionalism. From time to time, it will bring about the new value and the start of new learning again and again, and bring yourself closer to global value.
International Mobile lets you change your mind
Einstein said: ""Continuously doing the same thing in the same way, but expecting different results, is ridiculous!"" Only by changing the method and letting the values escalate can it be broken and embarked on a new situation.
The so-called ""hardworking laziness"" is a common diligence and misunderstanding. When you lack thinking and understanding, you repeat the same thing for a long time. In fact, it is futile. As with learning, the most important thing is to find the right way to help the learning process. Therefore, considering international mobility as the practice of knowledge and understanding of culture will make thinking more open.
""Reproducible Leadership"" mentions: Mastering the essentials, ordinary people can also become excellent leaders. If the team is in Shanghai, living alone in Beijing, how to manage and lead? In the era of international mobility, Fan Deng went to the company almost two months, mainly to have a meal with the CEO and the senior team, to open a meeting. Most of his time is reading, health and travel. His team's main strength is no more than 30 years old. A group of young people who have never started a business and have worked in a large company have created a development rate of one thousand per year. More importantly, they are happy at work!
The team leaders with international mobility have earnestly listened to the “costs of deaf people” and established an emotional account with the subordinates. After they have done something wrong with the subordinates, the subordinates will not easily anger their boss’s suggestion. Instead, they feel that the boss is really good for him. , not a meaningless personal attack. Supervisors don't have to stare at people, but they let employees have a high adhesion to him. Just like Charlie. Meng Ge said that golf can't be played according to his own instinct, and he has to learn some professional skills.
In the era of international mobility, a good leader is not to stick to the company, but to learn the skills of leadership and enhance team communication. Fan Deng said: Leaders should pay attention to the three. Too much work can't be said, and the team will live in anxiety and stress all day long. Supervisors often ""forgot to say"", which shows the arrogance of managers. They don't have to say that the fact that the subordinates ""should know"" is often the beginning of misunderstanding. Leaders who are ""sorry to say"" often let the team miss many opportunities and may have some fatal consequences. Real international mobility allows you to change your thinking and find better ways to solve many problems within your organization.
Mobile is to meet back to yourself
If you think of international mobility as a short-term life or work by swapping yourself into a strange space, then you misunderstand the meaning of international mobility. Some people say: Don't naively think about changing your own state through travel. It can change yours, not scenery, but experience.
Talking on the simplest trip, changing the time of a journey is the most romantic and pragmatic self-talk. Everyone's heart should have an established landscape, meet the real self through mobility, accompany the inner child, and find mature and confident adults after the desolate rebellious trip. The strangeness and uncertainty of travel can maximize the ability of life observation, because it is really impossible to get used to the usual days. Re-climbing, charging, re-starting, and traveling, you are triggered by new personnel and things, and grow up.
Leaving the comfort zone is to meet another one, not to spend money on a luxury decadent, just like Peter Su, ""If you can be simple, who wants to be complicated,"" says: ""I love the biggest reason for traveling, because you never Know what is waiting for you in front of you."" From the beginning of strangeness, each step becomes an organism, rooting and rooting, growing step by step. As soon as we step by step, the world becomes more open and free. When we are no longer able to get enough, we will go beyond the scared thunder pool. After discovering a hundred turns, you will find yourself a self-defeating, brave and purely just want to do it back. When I was young, I took my dreams forward.
International Mobile is a gorgeous adventure
Zhong Chenghu said that to do music, don't be unscrupulous, do the stone of struggle, throw something to this era. To go out, to move, to take your own path, you really have no foresight to follow, but because of the willingness to move, so the road is so strong and strong. I am willing to take a look at it. To some extent, it is the courage to die, and the life is just a few autumns. I really have nothing to fear. With an ideal and awkwardness, your state of mind and your body will be free to some extent. Unfamiliar space, a certain street, a certain store, and a certain back are all important backs of your past. From the moment of moving, it seems that the fragments of life are concentrated. ""Instant: Chen Yu's Lyrics Notes"" book mentions: ""The meaning of travel"" is a very far-reaching question: Where is the place to look forward to? What is the ideal in my heart? I haven't had an answer for a long time, so I got out of this melody. This song has a lot of memories of his own in the mobile space...
You can't pay attention to or respond to the world's excessive expectations of us, and even please. But do you dare to do something different from others? This confidence can be recovered through the gorgeous adventure of leaving and leaving.
The novelist's international mobility
""You said, what is there in Laos? What is the difference between the meaning of travel to a person and the meaning of a writer? Haruki Murakami said: Travel is a good thing. Although there will be fatigue, there will be disappointment, but there will be something. The real travel, perhaps at the moment of departure, is to explore yourself, walk through different landscapes, see different people, our life can really change or epiphany. I have found that sometimes the words written for work can't enjoy the pleasure of forgetting work. Traveling should leave your head blank and enjoy the pleasure and relaxation of indulging. There is always a moment when the aura is in a moment, the landscape and the mood blend together, the text is connected in series, the journey is smooth, the real feelings when the movement is settled, and the local life is vivid, the three-dimensional life is vivid. stand up. Therefore, the novelist got the inspiration from the international mobile power, and we moved from simply enjoying happiness to writing the Jiguang film plume. The mobile life of the two is equally exciting.
There is an international mobile called wandering
From ""turning the mountain"" to ""walking the river"", the writer's alternative style in international mobility is called wandering. ""Turning the Mountain"" said: ""Wandering is to see the world, can you live in the way you want."" At that time, Xie Wanglin was eager to see his growth and transformation from the wandering. ""Walking the River"" was the writer in the wandering. Awareness of more awareness and giving up. Xie Wanglin promised us to enjoy a beautiful wave in a time of absolute loneliness. We learned to use the drifting views of travelers to change the world. And cut. Guevara, who walked away from the comfort circle of Argentina, riding a motorcycle around South America, once a journey of 12,000 kilometers, completed a lonely and noble soul on the journey, found the growth of self, and Passion for the change of the ideal world. As the ""Motorcycle Journey on the Eve of the Revolution"" said: ""Let the world change you, you can change the world."" This does not confirm Mark's saying that a person's life is going crazy once, whether for a person, a love, A journey, even a dream. With regard to leaving, about international mobility, it is an issue that we can think and debate in our lifetime.
Find yourself on the world map
The educational viewpoint put forward by Yan Changshou, Chairman of the Public Welfare Platform Cultural Foundation, ""Find Yourself on the World Map"", many directions of thinking and Huang Yizhong coincide. They emphasize self-study and experience. They hope that students can use what they have learned, through hands-on practice, to produce real life experience and inner strength. For Taiwan's education, culture, economy, and national competitiveness, we all need to be curious and doubtful. The children who will think, will create, and the essence of education is to let students recognize their position, do not blindly fall into the trap of some kind of thinking, to reverse the original heart, so that learning is no longer confined to the classroom, subject to Under the pressure of time, I can learn more freely. As the Yanerva School predicted by Yan Changshou, it will become the next wave of education reform. If even education can learn in international mobility, It’s too shocking and eye-catching.
Creation is the end of international mobility
""My eyes are that Kangqiao taught me. My curiosity is that Kangqiao has given me a move. My self-consciousness is that Kangqiao gave me embryos."" I am in the book ""Holding Literature: Visiting British Famous"" I also see alternative mobility. One of the authors was Yan Aiqun, who went to the UK to study for a doctoral degree in 2001. She took up her literary slogan. She took an art pen and a handwritten book and recorded every literary foot through the lens. Liao Peirong specializes in the British female writer Vicinia. In Woolf's work, the two authors teamed up to create an amazing international mobile story about visiting British literature.
You know that the Coven Garden in London is the scene of the Shaw's ""La Traviata"", the Sherlock Holmes Museum is the fantasy world created by Conan Doyle, and the Monk's House is the reflection of Wu Erfu's voice for women. Where... Many of the works come from life, and the writers are willing to let readers read and learn internationally through text. The English pronunciation of the London cavity, the deer cap, the shawl trench coat, the British style... From the call of paper to the real movement, the power of words, let the cities and towns that are going to go, join more, Loved and precipitated imagination and yearning. Just like the Italian writer Amberto. UmbertoEco said: ""If you insist on resisting the inspiration of wisdom, then start with your detective novels!""
It turns out that international mobility is not just a matter of travel. From the different perspectives, we understand that when you have international mobility, you can live anywhere in the world and survive in the future. International mobility is not just a noun. It is regarded as a verb. It allows you to bring ""soft knowledge"" of ""language"" and ""culture"" in addition to professional technical ability. The special label of ""International Mobile"" belongs to you. The future is an era in which we can start from the ground and are willing to give full play to our strengths. We look forward to preparing ourselves, moving with competitiveness, moving to the rest of the world, and contributing to our use – appropriateness, adaptability and adaptability.
