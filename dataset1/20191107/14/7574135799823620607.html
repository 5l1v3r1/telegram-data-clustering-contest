      <p>In case you wondered if <b>Tool</b> frontman <b>Maynard James Keenan</b> had relaxed his stance on attendees taking pictures and videos at shows since A Perfect Circle’s last tour, where <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/a-perfect-circle-ejecting-dozens-at-shows-on-current-tour-for-taking-cellphone-pics/">dozens of people were ejected for taking cellphone pics</a>, the answer is: doesn’t look like it! As <i><a href="https://loudwire.com/tool-warn-ejection-show-cellphone-use/">Loudwire</a></i> points out, ticketholders for Tool’s recent Cleveland, OH show received a pre-show email warning them against snapping pics for the ‘gram:</p>
      <blockquote>We respectfully request that you please watch and listen to the show, not your phone. You will be ejected from the show without the opportunity to return and without a refund if you violate this simple request and elect to take photos during the performance. In the event of a personal emergency, phone use may occur on the concourse away from the performance area.</blockquote>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolBand/comments/ds8ebz/no_cameras_is_printed_on_the_tickets_posted_at/">redditor</a> said the warnings continued with signs “posted at every spot possible” at the venue, and printed on tickets.</p>
      <p>Maynard has a sense of humor, though; according to <i>Alternative Press</i> editor-in-chief Jason Pettigrew, who was in attendance, Maynard told the Cleveland audience they were “up to par,” and gave the okay for security to stand down and let people check their email.</p>
