      <p>Anti-government demonstrations have rocked Iraq's capital and its south, with sit-ins increasingly targeting main roads and state infrastructure -- including oil fields -- in OPEC's second-biggest producer.<br/><br/>About 90,000 barrels of crude oil meant for export were trapped at a northern Iraq field on Thursday because transport routes were cut by protests, an industry source told AFP.<br/><br/>The Qayyarah field in northern Iraq produces 30,000 barrels per day of crude oil that is trucked to the southern port of Basra to be exported, but sit-ins have sealed off some of those roads.<br/><br/>A senior source at the North Oil Company, which manages the Qayyarah field, told AFP on Thursday that trucks were unable to carry out that journey for a third consecutive day.<br/><br/>"These trucks usually transport the oil daily, but have been unable to do so since Tuesday because of what's happening in Basra," the source said.<br/><br/>"I don't know when it will resume as it depends on the situation stabilising and the roads being reopened."<br/><br/>Iraq is the fifth-largest oil exporter worldwide, sending around 3.4 million bpd out from its Basra port.<br/><br/>A vast majority of that oil is transported across the country via pipeline, and Qayyarah is one of the rare fields that sends its crude by truck.<br/><br/>The government's budget is funded almost exclusively by oil revenues and analysts have said a hit to exports could be "disastrous" for the country.<br/><br/>In the south, protesters this week have shut down the access route to the Dhi Qar oil company and the Shanafiyah refinery in Diwaniyah, according to AFP correspondents.<br/><br/>A sit-in has also cut the road to the Umm Qasr port, which brings in most food and medical imports through Basra, but it reopened on Thursday.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iraqi security forces shot dead at least four protesters in central Baghdad on Thursday, police and medical sources said.<br/><br/>Another 35 people were wounded in the clashes near Shuhada Bridge, they said, Reuters reported.</p>
