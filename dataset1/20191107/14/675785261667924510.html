      <p>A teenage boy who violently choked and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">raped</a> a 10-year-old girl as she walked home from school has been jailed for seven years.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old grabbed the schoolgirl as she walked along a street and dragged her to a nearby riverbank in Exmouth, Devon, on October 4, 2018.</p>
      <p>He restrained the girl around the neck after snatching her and then raped her after she fell unconscious next to the water.</p>
      <p>A passerby came to her aid after hearing her screaming for help.</p>
      <p>The boy, who was 16 at the time of the attack and cannot be named for legal reasons, previously pleaded guilty to rape on the first day of a retrial at Bristol Crown Court on July 22.</p>

      <p>He had earlier admitted choking and sexually assaulting the girl.</p>
      <p>In March, a jury at the first trial acquitted the boy of attempting to murder the girl.</p>
      <p>Jurors could not reach a decision on charges of rape and choking with intent to commit rape.</p>
      <p>During the trial the jury heard how the boy grabbed the girl, who he did not know, as she walked home from school.</p>
      <p>He restrained her around the neck and walked her to a nearby riverbank, where he raped her after she fell unconscious.</p>
      <p>The boy claimed he checked the girl had a pulse and waited until she woke up before leaving the area.</p>

      <p>A passerby heard the girl yelling from the stream and went to her aid, with police called a short time later.</p>
      <p>During his evidence in the trial, the boy said he carried out the attack because of "extraordinary emotions".</p>
      <p>He claimed he was angry, scared, depressed, sad and lonely at the time.</p>
      <p>"I just wanted someone else, just anybody, to feel at least some of the way I was feeling," he told the jury.</p>
      <p>The boy admitted the charge of rape on the first day of his re-trial in July.</p>
      <p>Mrs Justice May jailed the boy, who admitted charges of rape, choking the girl with intent to commit sexual assault and sexual assault, for seven years and two months.</p>
      <p>She also imposed an extended sentence of eight years on licence, which the boy will serve after his release from prison.</p>

      <p>The judge told him: "You violated her in the most ugly and cruel way.</p>
      <p>"After raping her, you stayed for a short while before leaving her in that state - half in and half out of the water, soaking wet.</p>
      <p>"Why on earth did you do it?"</p>
      <p>The judge said the boy had told a psychiatrist that he was "angry, full of resentment and wanted to cause damage" to another person.</p>
      <p>He believed attacking a person in a sexual manner would cause "the most psychological harm", Mrs Justice May said.</p>
      <p>"You took steps to inflict the most damage you could on a young person much smaller than you," she told the boy.</p>
      <p>"You used a great deal of force on her and you were aware of the impact of your actions."</p>
      <p>The judge said that impact on the girl and her family was "as bad as it possibly could be".</p>
