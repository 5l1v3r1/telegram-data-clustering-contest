      <h1>Celtic fan says Rome bar attack is first time he's feared for life following Hoops</h1>
      <h2>John Campbell has been following Celtic across Europe for 40 years and says that he has never been scared attending an away game until now.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:30:30+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A lifelong <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fanatic is ‘fearing for his life’ for the first time in 40 after two supporters were stabbed outside an Irish pub in Rome.</p>
      <p>John Campbell arrived in the Italian capital city on Tuesday evening ahead of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> club’s crunch Europa League tie against Lazio.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old, from Glasgow, has been following Celtic across Europe - visiting the likes of Barcelona and St Petersburg since he started supporting the club 40 years ago.</p>
      <p>He, along with six of his friends and family, were enjoying a drink in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-release-statement-after-two-20831393">Flann O’Brien</a>’s in Rome on Wednesday evening, when two fans were stabbed outside.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We were all here for a party and that’s what we got - we even had a good laugh with some of the Lazio lads", John told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Daily Record</a>.</p>

      <p>However, the atmosphere soured when word spread that two of the club’s fans had been stabbed near the Irish pub.</p>
      <p>Images from the streets near the pub showed blood on the ground and the pavement.</p>
      <p>Other footage showed the Baccanale bar in the Trastevere area of the city <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fan-attacks-puts-rome-20830835">also coming under attack</a>.</p>
      <p>John said.“One of the guys rushed into the pub and told everyone that someone had been attacked outside</p>
      <p>“Even though we were given warnings to be vigilant, everyone inside was hoping that the trip was going to go without incident.</p>
      <p>“The mood inside the pub just dropped when the we started hearing things about a stabbing."</p>
      <p>Prior to the Thursday night fixture, the Foreign Office warned fans not to wear club colours while visiting Rome after Celtic’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-2-lazio-1-3-20716068">2-1 win</a> in Glasgow last month.</p>
      <p>John said: “I’ve never seen any warnings like the ones the Foreign Office put out in all my years of supporting Celtic.</p>
      <p>“We had booked the tickets to come over to Rome months ago, so we never knew that it was going to be as tense as this.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to countless games against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> at Ibrox and I can honestly say I’ve never been scared about an away game before - but I am fearing for my life with this one.”</p>

      <p>Lazio fans caused outrage on the day of the match by making <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lazio-fans-way-celtic-park-20716855">fascist open handed salutes</a> while marching through Glasgow city centre.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s own ultra fans, The Green Brigade, countered by making a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-banner-draws-mussolini-response-20728990">massive banner</a> depicting fascist leader Benito Mussolini hanging upside down - depicting how he was treated after his death in Milan in 1945.</p>
      <p>Its message of “follow your leader” brought a UEFA charge for Celtic and led the club to believe the provocation might put fans in danger.</p>
      <p>Celtic FC issued detailed guidance on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/6-places-celtic-fans-should-20808095">fan safety</a> after considering that the potential risks in Rome exceeded anything else the club has faced in recent years.</p>
