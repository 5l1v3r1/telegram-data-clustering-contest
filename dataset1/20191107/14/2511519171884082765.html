      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/emilia-clarke">Emilia Clarke</a> has praised the nurses and paramedics who took care of her after she suffered from two <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/emilia-clarke-brain-aneurysm-stroke-game-of-thrones-what-is-it-symptoms-treatment-a8834631.html">brain aneurysms</a> as "unsung heroes". </p>
      <p>Earlier this year the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Game_of_Thrones"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> actor, who plays <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/daenerys-targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> in the HBO show, revealed she had to undergo life-saving surgery after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/emilia-clarke-aneurysm-brain-surgery-game-of-thrones-health-a8834546.html">suffering two brain aneurysms in 2011 and 2013</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=3659&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://people.com/tv/emilia-clarke-grateful-kindness-nurses-two-brain-hemorrhages/"><i>People</i></a> magazine for its first-ever “kindness” issue, the 33-year-old spoke about the people who helped her through the health scare, which left her unable to remember her own name. </p>
      <p>“It was a brain aneurysm that ruptured, and it was pretty traumatic,” Clarke said.</p>
      <p>“The paramedics were unbelievable. They’d given me drugs so I was in less pain, wrapped me up like a tortilla, and made me laugh the whole way to the hospital. </p>
      <p>“There I was, bleeding in the brain, and there we were in this ambulance having an absolute giggle. They were so gracious.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/last-christmas"><i>Last Christmas</i></a> star also shared how important the nurses were throughout the experience, revealing that they were part of the reason she decided to become an ambassador for the <a href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/">Royal College of Nursing</a> in 2018. </p>
      <p>“Every single nurse I came across was so kind,” Clarke explained. </p>
      <p>"Nurses are the unsung heroes; they’re at people’s most frightening moments."</p>
      <p>In addition to the devoted nurses, Clarke also praised her mother for always being by her side.</p>
      <p>"I feel endless gratitude—to my mum and brother, to my doctors and nurses, to my friends. </p>
      <p>“[My mum] went into mum superpower in the hospital. I had aphasia [loss of speech], and she looked at me and went, ‘Yeah, I know exactly what you mean'," Clarke said. </p>
      <p>“She made me believe she understood exactly what I was saying. It was genuinely her greatest moment.”</p>

      <p>Clarke first opened up about her brain aneurysms in an essay for <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpersonal-history%2Femilia-clarke-a-battle-for-my-life-brain-aneurysm-surgery-game-of-thrones&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/emilia-clarke-brain-aneurysm-nurse-paramedics-game-of-thrones-a9190216.html"><i>The New Yorker</i></a> in March this year. </p>
      <p>“In my worst moments, I wanted to pull the plug. I asked the medical staff to let me die,” she wrote, later adding, “In the years since my second surgery, I have healed beyond my most unreasonable hopes. I am now at 100%." </p>

      <p>Clarke has set up a charity in the UK and US called <a href="https://www.sameyou.org/">SameYou</a>, which aims to provide treatment for people recovering from brain injuries and stroke. </p>
      <p>She said she hopes the charity, which is aimed at supporting young people with brain injuries, will help others who are suffering from the “invisible illness”.</p>
