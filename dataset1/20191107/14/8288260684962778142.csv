The biggest online shopping day of the year takes place on November 29 in 2019 and this includes discounts on flights and hotels.

Expedia says: ""We will start posting new deals before the big day.
""Check on this Black Friday page regularly in order to stay up to date on the destinations on offer.""



The travel site teased that customers could find flights to Orlando, a weekend getaway to France, hotel package deals to sandy beaches or snowy mountains across the whole of November.
If you want bag a deal ahead of Black Friday then its early bird sale kicks off on November 25, with the landing page being updated with daily deals each day.
