      <h1>These are Nintendo's Black Friday 2019 deals for Switch</h1>
      <h2>$40 games, $60 controllers, and a Mario Kart console bundle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Devore</a></address>
      <p>Nintendo is mostly focusing on big-hitters for Black Friday 2019 – Switch games that have, and will, continue to sell well for years to come. Case in point: the main <b>hardware bundle</b> this year is a $300 Nintendo Switch console that throws in a digital copy of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-mario-kart-8-deluxe-430414.phtml"><i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i></a> (normally a $60 title).</p>
      <p>That deal kicks off November 28, 2019 at Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and GameStop.</p>
      <p>Is there a catch? Well, kinda. A word of caution: this particular Nintendo Switch is the older model, HAC-001, with an expected battery life of 2.5 to 6.5 hours (certain games hog the battery more than others). The newer Switch model, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/compare/">HAC-001(-01)</a>, has an approximate battery life of 4.5 to 9 hours.</p>
      <p>If you expect to primarily play your Switch in portable/handled mode, that comparison is definitely worth weighing. The newer battery makes a noticeable difference. Otherwise, if you're a TV player first and foremost, this might not be much of a factor for you. How do you tell them apart? The older Switch model has a product serial number starting with "XAW"; the newer model's serial begins with "XKW."</p>

          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These games will be on sale for $40 – that's $20 off – at Amazon, Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and GameStop starting November 27, 2019. <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> and <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild </i>are the must-haves, but you (arguably) can't go wrong with the rest of that list aside from maybe <i>Super Mario Party</i>. (It's fine, just a bit underwhelming. Also, <i>Mario Party </i>games tear families apart.)</p>
      <p>Those stores will also have the <b>Poké Ball Plus</b> – an <a href="https://pokeballplus.nintendo.com/">optional accessory</a> for <i>Pokémon Go</i>, <i>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!</i> and <i>Eevee!</i>, and <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> – for $20 on November 28. That's 60% off.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Amazon, Target, and Best Buy will have Switch <b>Joy-Con controllers</b> marked down to $60 on November 27. That might not sound like a deal, but these things usually go for $80. Yes, it's ridiculous.</p>
      <p>We don't yet know which digital games will make it into the Black Friday Switch eShop sale, but that's coming up. If you're a prospective Switch owner, keep an eye out for deals on <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22481/~/microsd-card-faq">microSD cards</a>, too.</p>
