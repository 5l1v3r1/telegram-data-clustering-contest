      <h1>Jurgen Klopp makes Liverpool Carabao Cup quarter-final team selection vow</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool face Aston Villa in the last eight of the Carabao Cup on December 17, and then play their Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar the very next day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:25:27+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has suggested that Liverpool's line-up for their Carabao Cup quarter-final tie at Aston Villa will closely resemble the side that beat Arsenal in the last round.</p>
      <p>The Reds beat the Gunners on penalties after a remarkable 5-5 draw at Anfield last week, setting up their last eight clash at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>But from the moment that victory was secured via a Curtis Jones penalty in front of the Kop, debate raged over just when the game with Dean Smith's side would be played.</p>
      <p>As European champions, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are in Qatar for the FIFA Club World Cup on December 18, and after much discussion with the EFL have decided to fit in the Villa tie the day before.</p>

      <p>The Reds are likely to field a team of younger player for the Villa game, and Klopp says they deserve the opportunity to play again.</p>
      <p>"I am not sure if we prioritise it (the Club World Cup)," he said when questioned by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzSNXCcnjas">Sky Sports</a> .</p>
      <p>"We had talks over the Club World Cup much longer. We had to make a decision over it and the boys wanted to play in it.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully it's not a once-in-a-lifetime chance but it doesn't happen too often. We decided to do that and after that we played in the Carabao Cup.</p>

      <p>"We have two games. In England, it's not that important. For the rest of the world, they look at that.</p>
      <p>"The Carabao Cup, we didn't know if we would go through. We played <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , a tough draw, with a much-changed team and I see it as an opportunity for them to play in the next round."</p>
      <p>Reports suggest the Liverpool under-23s boss Neil Critchley could take charge of the Villa game, with Klopp and most of his first-team already in Qatar.</p>

      <p>The German, though, says no decision has been taken on that matter yet.</p>
      <p>"I don't have to think about it yet," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have until the middle of December. We will find a proper solution for everybody.</p>
      <p>"I won't play! It won't make a difference to fans watching."</p>
