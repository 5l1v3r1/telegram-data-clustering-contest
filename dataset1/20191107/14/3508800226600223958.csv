《「零」導學》：成功的工作者都是由別人付錢，聘請他們享受自己的「嗜好」
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是所有成功的畫家、雕刻家、樂器演奏家、歌唱家、演說家、作家、教師、醫師、企業家，還有各行各業成功的工作者，都是由別人付錢，請他們來享受著自己的嗜好。



文：林德嘉
工作勤奮的習慣，是一個人能否成功的必要條件。懶惰、不努力工作，當然不可能成功，但是努力工作必須講求方法、策略與效率，才會提升成功的機率。
你願意為工作付出多大代價？
一個人工作會不會勤奮，與其是否能有策略、有效率地工作，以及個人才華和工作內容是否投合他的興趣息息相關。所以每個人尋求工作時，應該注意下列幾點：

分析才能，確定適合自身興趣和才華的工作。如果職業市場找不到自己理想的工作，就要設法創造。
尋找有職缺，符合自己理想的工作的公司，無論是私營公司、上巿公司、政府機關。
深入瞭解預計申請工作的公司，瞭解其高層成員的人品、公司的政策與人事制度。
評估自己的才華，可以給預計工作的公司做出多少貢獻。
有了信心確定自己可以為期待工作的單位做出貢獻，在申請工作時，就不要在意工資待遇是否豐厚，而是要集中精神專注於如何做出貢獻，甚至可以充滿信心地向公司表達，願意接受低待遇的試用期合約。制度健全的公司，不會以廉價勞力占你的便宜，只要你有信心、有才能，所謂試用期的低待遇，很快就會獲得補償。
寫出詳細完整的計劃，表達自己如何為期待的工作單位做出貢獻。

把申請工作的意願、個人背景及計劃，交給有人事權的人。個人的教育背景、工作經歷與意願、工作計劃等，只要不摻雜贅言，愈詳細愈佳。健全的公司不會草率聘用人，會很耐心地閱讀夠資格候選人的申請文件，並慎重考慮。
申請工作之前的準備工作，事實上就是已經在考驗一個人是否願意付出代價，為自己的前途鋪設。付出的代價，可以在工作的成就、報酬、未來的發展獲得回報而不願付出代價者，不曉得自己其實也已經付出了失業、待遇微薄、生活清苦的代價。
一位心理學家格林．伯格（H. M. Greenbery）曾經調查過18萬名工作人員，發現有80％的人厭倦自己的工作，這是人生的悲劇。其實，工作不只是在賺取生活費，工作本身就是人生的一部分。每個人都可以從工作中培養自信、自尊、責任感等許多人格特質。凡是登上巔峰的企業家，尤其是白手起家者，無不是勤奮的工作。他們之所以勤奮，是因為都熱愛自己選擇的工作，認為工作是一種享受。
至於工作報酬，卻是附帶所得的結果。第二次世界大戰後，美國人民的工作時間顯著減短，休閒時間增加許多。這種現象帶來的結果，竟然是社會問題如婚姻破碎、犯罪、身體疾病、精神疾病、酗酒、吸毒等比率升高，可見工作在人生中扮演何等重要的角色。第二次世界大戰以後，許多文明國家職業運動聯盟之所以崛起，應該就是解決社會問題的一帖處方。
熱愛工作，享受工作
資訊與科技突飛猛進的時代，資訊傳遞面之廣、頻率之高、速度之快，使得每個人的生活都處在應接不暇的狀態。你必須針對適合自己的核心才華可以發揮的領域，選擇方向確立目標，專心集中焦點，做好時間的管理，把大部分的時間用在可以發揮自己核心才華，有助於實現目標的方向上。
每個人都可能會有幾項核心的天賦，也就是特殊的才華。當你從事適合於自己才華的領域時，你會樂在其中、得心應手，或者可以學得比別人更快更容易，表現得比別人更突出。因此，必須細心檢視自己，找出自己的才華，列出2、3 項考慮作為生涯中可以專心從事的事業或職業。
1943 年，奧斯卡金像獎最佳女明星加森（Greer Garson，1904 ― 1996）說過：「人生最大的錯誤，就是開始為賺錢找工作。你應該尋找適合自己才華的工作，如果你真的足夠好，錢自然而然就會來。」加森的話，確實道破了許多無法成功的人，未能獲取成功的根源。假如目前的工作並不適合你的才華，但待遇優厚，那麼就應該從工作中培養出興趣。
懷蘭（Wyland）喜歡畫圖，開始在鄰近的中學開畫展，只要有人想買他的畫，無論價格高低，他都不計較，只希望可以得到一些錢，買繪畫的材料。有一天母親告訴他，藝術只能當嗜好，不能當職業，並且把他帶到底特律失業局找工作。懷蘭卻無心在工廠之類的場所工作，連續3天換了3種工作，都被解僱。
他一心只想當畫家，就在自家的地下室設立工作室，日夜工作，終於獲得底特律藝術學校的全額獎學金。
於是他把握機會，專心繪畫。雖然幾年繪畫所得的錢只能維持基本的生活，但他仍然決心要做畫家，繼續磨練繪畫的功力。最後為求發展，他搬到加州拉古那海灘，因為那裡有許多畫廊可以啟發靈感。
懷蘭就在那裡又奮鬥了好幾年，終於開設了自己的畫廊。他一度每年可以畫1000幅作品，有些作品一張可以賣200萬美元。後來他在加州夏威夷佛羅里達擁有4棟房子，經濟狀況應該相當富有。他能把自己的嗜好作為謀生的工具，又能創造財富，這是多麼幸福的人生。當然這也是付出代價所得的結果。
做自己喜歡的事，找到謀生方向
威廉姆斯（Pet Williams）的策略是先尋找自己喜歡做的事，再從喜歡做的事當中，探究是否可以將其作為謀生的事業，然後確立人生的目標，朝自己既可以享受，又能作為謀生的方向努力。
對於威廉姆斯而言，在他孩童時期，父親第一次帶他去看費城隊的棒球賽開始，他就愛上運動，並且決定要以運動作為謀生的事業，確立他的人生目標。威廉姆斯開始參與運動，學習閱讀《紐約時報》的運動版，搜集棒球卡片，在學校的報紙寫運動專欄。
畢業後，威廉姆斯找到可以在費城棒球隊的辦公室裡工作，後來轉到費城的一個籃球團隊中工作。當NBA考慮擴展球隊數時，威廉姆斯即帶領他的團隊，爭取到奧蘭多魔術隊的經營權。他成功地選擇了自己喜歡的工作，作為謀生的事業，最終當上奧蘭多魔術隊球團的首席副總裁，並寫了36本書，成為職業的演說家。
曼蒂．羅伯特（Monty Roberts，1935―）在中學時代，老師要求學生寫未來的志向時，他寫了長大以後要擁有200畝的牧場，馴養純種賽馬，老師給了「F」的成績，老師認為一位只能在小型卡車的後院，搭帳蓬的窮家小孩，不可能積蓄那麼多的錢買牧場，買純種賽馬，還要僱用馴馬師，所以給「F」的成績，正是反映不切實際的寫作。
老師要求曼蒂．羅伯特重寫，來換取較高的成績。曼蒂．羅伯特回答老師說：「你保留『F』就好，我繼續維持自己的夢想。」
這位正是《傾聽馬的人》（The Man Who Listens to Horses）的作者，目前在加洲的索夫昂（Solvang）就擁有154畝的牧場，以人性化的方式訓練了數百位的訓馬師，也蓄養了許多純種的賽馬。曼蒂．羅伯特本身充滿激情，喜愛自己的工作，本身的馴馬獲得了8次美國賽馬的錦標，也贏得超過300次以上國際純種馬的賽跑。
他寫了數本書，《傾聽馬的人》在《紐約時報》列為最暢銷書長達58週之久。一個人如果沒有雄心壯志，沒有理想，只侷限在現實環境認為合理的尺度下立定目標，則一生只有處在妥協的情境，無法發揮深藏的潛能。
西蒙．波娃（Simon de Beauvouir，1908―1986）說過：「天才不是與生俱來的，而是培養出來的。」（One isnot born a genius, one becomes a genius.）真正有了興趣，特殊的才華就可以從中培養出來。
假如目前的工作待遇不高，又不適合自己的才華，最好在工作之餘，尋找創造適合自己才華的工作做為副業，慢慢地副業就會變成正業。做自己可以樂在其中的工作，又可以賺錢，這是人生何等的享受。老虎伍茲（Tiger Woods）從小學高爾夫，迷上了打高爾夫，大家卻要付錢請他，繼續玩他自己喜歡的小白球。
沙沙（Sammy Sosa）小時候在多明尼加擦皮鞋，每個月賺不到10塊錢，愛上棒球以後天天玩，到了美國大聯盟，在芝加哥俱樂部（Chicago Club），每季打出60到70支的全壘打，打出去的那種快感，是他人生的最大享受，而他在享受自己人生的同時，又獲得年薪1062萬5000美元，請他繼續享受，難怪他會說棒球太好玩了。
所有成功的畫家、雕刻家、樂器演奏家、歌唱家、演說家、作家、教師、醫師、企業家，還有各行各業成功的工作者，都是由別人付錢，請他們來享受著自己的嗜好。
選擇自己真正喜歡的工作，作為謀生的工作，那麼你一定會廢寢忘食地工作而不會感到疲倦。畫家畢卡索曾經說：「當我在工作時，我覺得是在放鬆，當我在無所事事或為著要應對訪客時，我覺得很疲憊。」馬克．吐溫（Mark Twain，1835―1910）也說過：「成功的秘訣，就在於能夠把職業當作在放假。」真正愛自己的工作時，就會有如此的心情──工作就是在享受人生。

""Zero"" Guide: Successful workers pay for others and hire them to enjoy their ""hobbies""
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that all successful painters, sculptors, instrumentalists, singers, orators, writers, teachers, physicians, entrepreneurs, and successful workers from all walks of life are paid by others. Please invite them to enjoy their hobbies.



Text: Lin Dejia
The habit of working hard is a necessary condition for a person to succeed. Being lazy and not working hard can certainly not be successful, but hard work must focus on methods, strategies and efficiencies to increase the chances of success.
How much are you willing to pay for your work?
Whether a person can work diligently is closely related to whether he can work strategically and efficiently, and whether his personal talents and job content are suitable for his interests. So when everyone seeks a job, they should pay attention to the following points:

Analyze your talents and determine the work that suits your interests and talents. If the professional market can't find its ideal job, it must be managed.
Look for companies that have jobs that meet their ideal jobs, whether they are private companies, captains, or government agencies.
Gain an in-depth understanding of the companies that are expected to apply for jobs, and understand the character of their senior members, the company's policies and personnel systems.
Assess your talents and how much you can contribute to the company you expect to work for.
Have the confidence to make sure that you can contribute to the unit you are looking for. When you apply for a job, don’t worry about whether the salary is rich, but concentrate on how to make a contribution, and even express your confidence to the company with confidence. Accept a low-paid trial period contract. A company with a sound system will not take advantage of cheap labor. As long as you have confidence and talent, the so-called low-term treatment period will soon be compensated.
Write a detailed and complete plan to express how you contribute to the desired work unit.

Give the willingness to apply for a job, personal background and plan to someone with authority. Personal education background, work experience and willingness, work plan, etc., as long as it is not rumored, the more detailed the better. A sound company will not rush to hire people, and will patiently read the application documents of qualified candidates and consider them carefully.
The preparatory work before applying for a job is actually testing whether a person is willing to pay the price and lay for his future. The price paid can be rewarded in the achievement of work, remuneration, and future development, and it is not willing to pay the price. I don’t know that I have already paid the price of unemployment, meager treatment, and hard life.
A psychologist, Green. H. M. Greenbery has surveyed 180,000 staff members and found that 80% of people are tired of their work. This is the tragedy of life. In fact, work is not just about earning living expenses, but work itself is part of life. Everyone can cultivate many personality traits such as self-confidence, self-esteem, and responsibility from work. Entrepreneurs who are on the peak, especially those who start from scratch, are not diligent. They are diligent because they love the work they choose and think that work is a pleasure.
As for the remuneration for work, it is the result of incidental income. After the Second World War, the working hours of the American people were significantly shortened, and leisure time increased a lot. The result of this phenomenon is actually the rise of social problems such as broken marriage, crime, physical illness, mental illness, alcoholism, drug abuse, etc., showing how important work plays in life. After the Second World War, the rise of many civilized countries' professional sports leagues should be a prescription for solving social problems.
Love work and enjoy work
In the era of rapid advancement of information and technology, the wide range of information transmission, the high frequency and the fast speed make everyone's life in an unstoppable state. You must set the direction for the areas that your core talents can play, choose the direction, focus on the management of time, spend most of your time in the direction that can play your core talents and help achieve the goal.
Everyone may have several core talents, that is, special talents. When you are engaged in a field that suits your talents, you will be happy, be able to learn, be able to learn faster and easier than others, and be more prominent than others. Therefore, you must carefully examine yourself and find out your talents, and list 2 or 3 items as a career or career that you can concentrate on in your career.
In 1943, the best female star of the Academy Awards, Greer Garson (1904 - 1996), said: ""The biggest mistake in life is to start looking for work for making money. You should look for a job that suits your talents, if you really Good enough, the money will come naturally."" Garson’s words did indeed break many unsuccessful people and failed to get the root of success. If the current job is not suitable for your talents, but the treatment is good, then you should cultivate interest from your work.
Wyland likes to draw pictures and start painting in neighboring middle schools. As long as someone wants to buy his paintings, regardless of the price, he doesn't care, just wants to get some money and buy painting materials. One day the mother told him that art can only be a hobby, can't be a professional, and take him to the Detroit Unemployment Bureau to find a job. However, Huailan was unwilling to work in a factory and the like. She changed three jobs for three consecutive days and was fired.
He only wanted to be a painter, set up a studio in his basement, worked day and night, and finally won a full scholarship from the Detroit Art School.
So he seized the opportunity and concentrated on painting. Although the money from painting for a few years can only maintain a basic life, he is still determined to be a painter and continue to hone his skills in painting. Finally, for development, he moved to Laguna Beach, California, where there are many galleries to inspire.
Hualan struggled there for several years and finally opened his own gallery. He once painted 1,000 works a year, and some of them can sell for $2 million. Later, he owned four houses in Hawaii, Florida, California, and the economy should be quite rich. He can use his hobby as a tool for making a living and create wealth. What a happy life. Of course, this is also the result of paying the price.
Do what you like and find a way to make a living.
Pet Williams' strategy is to find what he likes to do, and then explore whether he can use it as a career for a living, and then establish the goal of life, and enjoy it for himself. Work hard in the direction of making a living.
For Williams, when he was a child, his father took him to the Philadelphia team for the first time. He fell in love with sports and decided to use sports as a career to earn a living. Williams began to participate in the sport, learning to read the sports version of The New York Times, collecting baseball cards, and writing sports columns in school newspapers.
After graduating, Williams found himself working in the Philadelphia baseball team's office and later moved to a basketball team in Philadelphia. When the NBA considered expanding the number of teams, Williams led his team to win the Orlando Magic's management rights. He succeeded in choosing his favorite job, as a career for a living, and eventually became the chief vice president of the Orlando Magic team and wrote 36 books to become a professional speaker.
Mandy. In the middle school age, when the teacher asked the students to write the future ambitions, he wrote that after growing up, he had to have 200 acres of pastures, domesticated purebred horses, and the teacher gave the ""F"" results. The teacher thought that one It can only be used in the backyard of a small truck. It is impossible to save so much money to buy a ranch, buy a purebred racehorse, and hire a horse trainer. Therefore, the result of giving the ""F"" is reflected. Unrealistic writing.
The teacher asked Mandy. Robert rewritten in exchange for higher grades. Mandy. Robert replied to the teacher and said, ""You just keep ""F"", I will continue to maintain my dreams.""
This is the author of The Man Who Listens to Horses, who currently has 154 acres of ranch in Solvang, California, training hundreds of people in a humane way. The trainer also stocks many purebred racehorses. Mandy. Robert himself is full of passion and loves his work. His own horse has won 8 American horse racing championships and won more than 300 international thoroughbred races.
He has written several books, ""The Man Who Listens to Horses"" has been listed as the best-selling book in the New York Times for 58 weeks. If a person has no ambition, no ideals, and is limited to setting goals on a scale that the real environment considers reasonable, then he will only be in a compromised situation and will not be able to exert his deep potential.
Simon. Simon de Beauvouir (1908-1986) said: ""Genius is not born, but cultivated."" (One isnot born a genius, one becomes a genius.) Really interested, special Talent can be cultivated from it.
If the current job is not high, and it is not suitable for your talents, it is best to find a job that is suitable for your talents as a sideline, and slowly become a business. It is the enjoyment of life to do the work that you can enjoy and to make money. Tiger Woods has been fascinated with golf from elementary school golf, but everyone has to pay for him to continue playing his favorite white ball.
When Sammy Sosa was a child, he wiped his shoes in Dominica, earning less than 10 yuan a month. After playing baseball, he played every day. He went to the American League, and at the Chicago Club, he played 60 to 70 per season. The home run of the branch, the kind of pleasure that he played out, is the greatest enjoyment of his life. While enjoying his life, he earned an annual salary of 10.62 million US dollars. Please continue to enjoy it. No wonder he would say that baseball is too fun. .
All successful painters, sculptors, instrumentalists, singers, orators, writers, teachers, physicians, entrepreneurs, and successful workers from all walks of life are paid by others and invited to enjoy themselves. Hobbies.
Choose the job you really like, as a job for a living, then you will work in a sleepless night without getting tired. The painter Picasso once said: ""When I was at work, I felt relaxed. When I was doing nothing or dealing with visitors, I felt very tired."" Mark. Twain (1835-1910) also said: ""The secret of success is to be able to take a career as a holiday."" When you really love your job, you will have this feeling - work is to enjoy life. .
