      <p>Interestingly, this photo comes just days after the actress shared a video of herself learning Kathak for her upcoming film ‘Thalaivi’, a biopic on late Tamil Nadu CM J <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/J.-Jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a> <b><i>.</i></b></p>
      <p>However, it looks like the biopic hit a roadblock recently when the Madras High Court on issued a notice to director Gowtham Vasudev Menon and others on a plea opposing their proposed bilingual biopic on the late Tamil Nadu chief minister. Justice K.Kalyanasundaram sought the response of Menon and filmmakers <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vishnu-Vardhan">Vishnu Vardhan</a> Induri and A L Vijay when an application arising out of a suit filed by Jayalalithaa's niece <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepa-Jayakumar">Deepa Jayakumar</a> came up for hearing.</p>
