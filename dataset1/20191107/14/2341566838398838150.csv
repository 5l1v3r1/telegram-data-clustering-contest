07 Nov 2019, 14:12 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者陳俊華台北7日電）文化部長鄭麗君今天表示，文化部將進行組織改造，包括將文化資產局升格為文化資產署、新設「博物館司」。此外，影視及流行音樂發展司和影視及流行音樂產業局整併為文化產業署，全案仍須經行政院核定。
立法院教育及文化委員會今天邀請文化部長鄭麗君列席，審查文化部及所屬單位預算。
鄭麗君受訪時表示，文化部組織法在這2、3年持續檢討，主要是以文化基本法為基礎及文化政策白皮書、推動的各項政策及整體性的思維，來重新修改文化部組織法，因為政策要體系化，其實需要組織、法律、預算及計畫要一致化。
鄭麗君表示，其中就包含文資局要升格成文資署，讓政策和推動可以合一，且在各地方有分署辦公室；另外司、局過去沒有整合，現在要把相關的文化產業整合；各國博物館政策都是很重要的基本文化政策，有博物館法後，接下來就會希望有博物館司、博物館政策。
目前文化部下設7個業務司、2個局，未來擬組改為5個司、2個署。鄭麗君說，總數其實沒有成長，都是在既有數量下進行調整跟整合，但更細部內容要尊重行政院的審查，若有共識就會及早說明。
根據文化部規劃，未來影視及流行音樂發展司將與影視及流行音樂產業局整併，並與文創發展司、人文及出版司等相關業務合併為「文化產業署」；文化資產局將升格為文化資產署，另外將新增「博物館司」。（編輯：林興盟）1081107
