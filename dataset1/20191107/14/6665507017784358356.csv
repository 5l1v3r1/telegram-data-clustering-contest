The 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry in Essex have all been identified and their families told, Essex Police said. 
In a statement, the force said all of the victims found in the back of a lorry in Grays last month had been formally identified and their families informed.
“This is an important step in the investigation and enables us to work with our Vietnamese Police colleagues to support the families of those victims,” Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said. 
“It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information,” he said. 
“Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.”
