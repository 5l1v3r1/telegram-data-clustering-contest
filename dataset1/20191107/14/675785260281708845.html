      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:42:06+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Everton boss Marco Silva has confirmed Andre Gomes could return before the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Gomes suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle during Sunday's 1-1 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> at Goodison Park after a late challenge from Son Heung-min.</p>
      <p>There were initial fears the Portuguese midfielder would be out of action for up to a year with the injury.</p>
      <p>Gomes has since undergone successful surgery and ahead of his side's vital clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , Silva said: "It is not easy to give a sure date about when he will return.</p>
      <p>"But the feedback from medical staff is, it is possible we will see him playing again this season.</p>

      <p>"It looks like a really serious injury, but everything went really well and we hope we can see him playing again this season."</p>
      <p>Son confirmed he had text Gomes about the injury with his red card later rescinded by the FA.</p>
      <p>Silva added: "Of course it was the toughest moment for Andre and the other players on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"For the two players involved it was really tough as well. What is most important is to give Andre all the support he needs in this moment.‚Äù</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> head to Southampton in 17th in the table, just three points ahead of their opponents.</p>
      <p>Their task has been made harder with Fabien Delph struggling with injury, depleting Silva's midfield options even further.</p>
      <p>Morgan Schneiderlin is expected to return for the Toffees but Silva has not ruled out giving youngster Anthony Gordon a chance.</p>
