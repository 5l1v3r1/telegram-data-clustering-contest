07 Nov 2019, 14:59

　那覇市の首里城で起きた火災で、同市消防局は７日、火元とみられる正殿内の配線や延長コードの計数十か所に焼け溶けた痕跡が確認されたと発表した。いずれも正殿の北東部分に設置された分電盤につながっており、このうち数か所はショートしたとみられる。同局は電気系統のトラブルが有力な出火原因とみており、詳しく鑑定する。
　同局によると、痕跡は正殿１階の北東部分にあった分電盤に電力を供給する配線１本と、分電盤から発光ダイオード（ＬＥＤ）照明につながる延長コードで確認された。出火当時も電気が通じていたとみられる。配線には溶けた痕跡が１か所あり、延長コードは焼損して３０か所以上で寸断されていた。
　正殿は毎日午後９時半に自動でブレーカーが落ちる仕組みだったが、出火当時は防犯カメラのほか、延長コードを通じて照明器具にも電気が通っていたという。
　また、同局は出火した１０月３１日未明、正殿北東部分を外部から撮影していた防犯カメラに、白い強烈な光が瞬間的に映っていたことも明らかにした。この時間帯に電気設備に異常が起きた可能性があるとみている。

Wiring inside Shurijo Castle, traces of melting and melting in dozens of places ... Firefighting announcement

07 Nov 2019, 14:59

In the fire that broke out in Shuri Castle in Naha City, the city fire department announced on the 7th that there were traces of burnt and melted wiring in the main hall, which seems to be the source of fire, and ten extension cords. All of them are connected to a distribution board installed in the northeastern part of the main shrine, and it seems that several of them are short-circuited. The station sees electrical system troubles as a probable cause of fire, and makes a detailed assessment.
According to the bureau, the trace was confirmed with one wiring that supplies power to the distribution board located in the northeastern part of the first floor of the main shrine, and an extension cord connected to the light emitting diode (LED) lighting from the distribution board. It seems that electricity was still in use at the time of the fire. There was one melted trace on the wiring, and the extension cord was burned out and cut into more than 30 locations.
The main shrine was designed to automatically break the breaker every day at 9:30 pm, but at the time of the fire, it was said that electricity was passed through the extension cord as well as the security camera.
Also, the station revealed that white intense light was instantaneously reflected on the security camera that had taken the northeastern part of the main hall from outside at dawn on October 31 when the fire broke out. We believe that there may be an abnormality in the electrical equipment during this time.
