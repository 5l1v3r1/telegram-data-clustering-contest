Scribner

[Be sure to watch Serena Altschul's report on ""Joy of Cooking"" on ""Sunday Morning"" November 10!]

Of their Mushroom Confit they write:
""We first encountered mushroom confit in a Thomas Keller cookbook, and we've been tweaking the recipe for years. In our opinion, this is the perfect way to preserve wild mushrooms from a successful foraging venture. Serve as part of an antipasto spread or cheese board, or toss with pasta, serve over polenta, or pile on thickly sliced toasted bread.""
Mushroom Confit

Makes about 6 cups

Toss together in a colander placed in the sink or over a bowl:2 pounds mushrooms, larger ones quartered, any tough stems removed1 tablespoon salt
Let sit for 1 hour. Gently press any excess moisture out of them (do not rinse). Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 200°F.
Combine in a large ovenproof saucepan or Dutch oven:2 cups olive oil2 shallots, thinly sliced4 garlic cloves, smashed4 sprigs thyme1 small sprig rosemary1 bay leaf1/2 teaspoon black pepper
Set the heat to medium and wait for the garlic to start faintly bubbling. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mixture steep for at least 15 minutes.
Add the mushrooms, cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven, uncover, and stir in:1/4 cup sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar1 teaspoon smoked paprika
