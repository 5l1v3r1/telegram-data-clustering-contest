        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 7 – The government has committed to provide adequate security to residents of Marsabit county, following Tuesday’s attack that left 10 people dead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two police officers were among those killed on Tuesday when bandits staged two separate attack.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The first attack occurred in Kukuto area where three people were killed when armed bandits ambushed their vehicle.</p>
      <p>In the second attacks, 7 other people including two police officers were killed in Jaldesa.</p>
      <p>National Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna told the press on Thursday a team of law enforcers has since been deployed in the troubled area, in a bid to restore normalcy.</p>
      <p>“As a government we are concerned about such incidents, as we speak a team has been dispatched to determine status of the attack,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the authorities are yet to establish what prompted the attack.</p>
      <p>This is the latest in a series of killings pitting clans in the expansive county bordering Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>The killers targeted national government administrators setting a chief ablaze, according to police.</p>
      <p>Marasbit Governor Mohamud Ali led a host of local leaders in expressing their disappointment on the loss of lives.</p>
      <p>“We cannot keep crying every day, we cannot keep burying people months after months,” Ali said.</p>
      <p>The leaders urged the government to address rampant insecurity in the region.</p>
      <p>Marasbit County Commander Steve Oloo also called for peace among warring factions.</p>
      <p>“An eye for an eye is an old mentality,” he said.</p>
