      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:14:47+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>If you're one to know every word from Christmas classics such as Elf and Home Alone, there's a good chance your festive film binges are doing wonders for your health.</p>
      <p>The even better news is that we're actually being encouraged to watch Christmas movies <i>all year round</i> to give a boost to our 'feel-good' hormones which comes with snuggling down and turning on flicks like Love Actually and Die Hard (there's no time for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/die-hard-ultimate-christmas-film-13664309">that debate</a> ).</p>
      <p>A psychologist has revealed that these films have been proven to help people live longer and healthier lives, as reported by <a href="https://doyouremember.com/92889/health-benefits-christmas-movies-year">DoYouRemember?</a> , so don't be a Grinch.</p>

      <p>Discussing the benefits of Christmas films, the psychologist said: "It does create that neurological shift that can produce happiness.</p>
      <p>"I think anything that takes us out of our normal habituation, the normal day in, day out, signals our senses, and then our senses measure if it’s pleasing or not.</p>
      <p>"Christmas decorating will spike dopamine, a feel-good hormone."</p>
      <p>As well as bringing us some much-needed festive cheer, it can also help reduce levels of stress and anxiety.</p>

      <p>Watching Christmas movies with someone else can even strengthen your relationship, including anyone from a love interest to a family member.</p>
      <p>The nostalgia which comes with the films can bring people together due to the focus on family values and close bonds.</p>
      <p>As if you needed anymore encouragement, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> has revealed a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/upcoming-netflix-christmas-movies-revealed-20635635">host of new Christmas movies</a> that it will be releasing in the countdown to the big day.</p>
      <p>The original films include some big name appearances, such as Kristin Davis and Vanessa Hudgens, while also continuing the popular festive franchise A Christmas Prince.</p>
      <p>So don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't watch Christmas films in June. Science says yes.</p>
