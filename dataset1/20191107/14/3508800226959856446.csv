《向下扎根！德國教育的公民思辨課7》：為何網路上會有這麼多的「仇恨言論」？
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是「hate speech」是英文詞彙，意即「仇恨言論」。它們往往是針對不同膚色、不同信仰、不同出身或不同性取向的人而來。人們往往會使用文字、照片或符號來貶抑這些人。



文：曼佛雷德．泰森（Manfred Theisen）
【網路霸凌與仇恨言論】
懲罰：什麼能夠威脅霸凌者？
「人性尊嚴不可侵犯。」這點明文規定於德國《基本法》第一條中。然而，網路霸凌卻是在侵犯人性尊嚴。法律如何保護受害者免於受到傷害呢？
奧地利《刑法》第107c條規定，在網路上、透過電話或是在廣播電視上持續妨害或騷擾他人，將被處以刑罰。人們也不許在其他人面前傷害某人的「名譽」，或是讓其他人得以取得某人的照片，違反者將面臨一年以下的有期徒刑。
雖然德國沒有特別的網路霸凌條款，不過霸凌者往往會同時觸犯《刑法》裡的多項規定，例如侮辱某人（第185條）、說別人的壞話（第186條）、強迫某人做某些事情（第240條）、威脅某人（第241條）＊，以及在未經某人同意下轉發某人的錄音、錄影和照片（第201條）＊等等。違反這些規定的人，輕則會被判處罰款，重則可能要面臨長達五年的徒刑。
在德國，青少年從14歲以上才要承擔刑事責任，但這並不代表更年輕的行為者可以全身而退（編按：台灣形況亦然）。民事責任適用於七歲以上的兒童。因此，受害者的父母可以透過律師向對方發出警告，要求對方不作為。換言之，霸凌者必須以書面形式表明自己將來不會再霸凌。霸凌者的父母必須為這項警告支付高昂的律師費。如果拒絕簽署停止霸凌聲明或再次霸凌，則必須面臨進一步的罰款甚至於訴訟程序。
不僅是照片和影片，就連某人的錄音，在你公開這些材料前，你都必須先徵得對方的同意。

編注：在台灣，霸凌者的行為可能會觸犯《刑法》的規定，包括侮辱（第309條）、誹謗（第310條）、強制（第304條）、恐嚇（第305、346條）、剝奪他人行動自由（第302條）、傷害他人身體或健康（第277、278條）等。
編注：在台灣，侵害人格權的行為則會觸犯《民法》（第195條）。


為何網路上會有這麼多的仇恨？
「hate speech」是英文詞彙，意即「仇恨言論」。它們往往是針對不同膚色、不同信仰、不同出身或不同性取向的人而來。人們往往會使用文字、照片或符號來貶抑這些人。
一直以來，都存在著謾罵其他族群的人這樣的事情。這樣的事情也總是錯的；無論謾罵所針對的是穆斯林、猶太人、基督徒、移民還是原住民。然而，在過去20年中，這種敵意卻是有增無減。
這有兩個原因：首先，如今我們有社群網路，每個人都能藉此迅速傳播自己的意見。其次，2001年9月11日所發生的「911事件」，徹底改變了這個世界。當時，激進的伊斯蘭主義者刺客，針對位於美國紐約的世貿中心（World Trade Center），發動了一場恐怖攻擊。這場恐攻造成了大約3,000人死亡。在這樣的情況下，對於激進的伊斯蘭主義者（radical Islamist）的恐懼，加劇了人們對穆斯林移民的偏見。
也因此，在德語國家裡，仇恨言論往往是針對穆斯林。而這也與日益增加的難民有關。
仇恨者常見的手法就是：他們會區分「自己人」與「他人」，而對他人總是給予負面的評價。如果他人之中有個人被逮到偷竊，散播仇恨言論的人就會立即將這起事件推論到這個人所屬的整個族群，接著，例如所有的難民，都會因此自動變成竊賊。個案就這樣被抹黑成通案。不僅如此，它們往往還會被加油添醋，然後整起件事就又成了網路上的仇恨言論。
恐怖就是故意擴散害怕和驚恐。為此，恐怖分子除了謀殺以外，他們有時還會進行公開處決並發布行刑的影片。激進的伊斯蘭主義者意欲以神（真主）的名義，將國家改造成根據伊斯蘭教法、嚴格的穆斯林社會；或是根據他們是如何解釋伊斯蘭教（穆斯林的宗教）。在此過程中他們無懼於使用暴力。

你能如何對抗仇恨言論？
仇恨言論是本於斷言，而非本於事實。絕大多數沒有根據的斷言，你都可以憑藉事實與駁倒它們的論證對付之。例如：
斷言：我們無法收容所有的難民！
反駁：事實上，我們也無須收容所有的難民。因為大多數的難民都是在他們本國的某些地方避難，或是逃往與國土直接接壤的鄰國。在人口比例上，黎巴嫩收容難民的比例最高：2015年，同樣都以每1,000人為分母，黎巴嫩平均每千人收容了約183名難民，土耳其約32人，瑞典約17人，奧地利約10人，德國則只有5人。
斷言：恐怖分子會跟著尋求庇護的人混入我們的國家。
反駁：許多難民都在自己的故鄉因恐怖攻擊而失去了親戚或朋友，他們自己甚至也曾在這類攻擊中倖免於難。他們和我們一樣害怕在這個國家裡發生恐怖攻擊。
斷言：難民好吃懶做！
反駁：難民不是來德國工作，而是因為他們遭受迫害，或是不得不逃離戰爭和恐怖。因此，我們的國家給予他們保護（庇護）。不過，獲得許可的政治庇護申請者，倒是能夠從事某種職業。其餘的難民則可在一定的條件下，在我們的國家裡工作。
斷言：庇護政策只是在浪費我們的錢。
反駁：政治庇護申請者今後可以幫助我們與阿拉伯國家建立更好的聯繫。因為他們不僅了解自己的語言和文化，也對我們的語言和文化有所認識。
斷言：戴頭巾的女性根本無心融入我們的社會。
反駁：戴頭巾的動機不一而足，與融入的意願完全無關。許多婦女之所以戴頭巾是出於宗教或文化的原因。在我們的民主制度裡存在著宗教自由，而這也明訂於《歐洲聯盟基本權利憲章》（Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union）中。
斷言：根本就沒有大屠殺這回事！
反駁：確有其事！猶太人、同性戀者、羅姆人（Roma）、辛提人（Sinti）以及其他族群，在第三帝國中慘遭納粹分子大規模殺害，這是一個無可爭辯且不容否認的事實。任何否認此事的人，都有可能被處以刑罰。
如果你正在尋找更多的論點，或是你想更深入地研究仇恨言論，你不妨上德國聯邦政府所資助的www.no-hate-speech.de這個網站上獲取相關資訊。
庇護（asylum）一詞源自古希臘語，意思是「安全」。獲得庇護的人，至少在生命上有了一定的保障，而且可以獲得一個能夠遮風避雨的地方。大屠殺（holocaust）一詞同樣也源自古希臘語，意思就是「完全燒毀」。從大約1970年起，這個詞彙就被用來指涉納粹時期針對數百萬歐洲猶太人所為的謀殺。希伯來文中的「shoah」一詞也有同義的用法，其本意則是「大災難」、「浩劫」。否認大屠殺，最高可判處五年以下的有期徒刑。

對抗網路仇恨的政策是什麼？
自2018年1月1日起，《網路執行法》（NetzDG）已在德國生效。該法旨在遏止網路上的仇恨、煽動及故意的虛假報導。換言之，旨在對抗與網路霸凌、仇恨言論及假新聞有關的重重惡行。
然而，這項法律卻僅適用於Facebook、Twitter與YouTube等社群媒體，而不適用於像WhatsApp之類的即時通訊服務或電子郵件。這項法律究竟有些什麼具體的規定呢？
如果有人在某個網路平台上，針對像是仇恨言論之類明顯違法的內容提出申訴，平台營運商就有責任在24小時內檢查該內容，必要時也應將違法內容移除。如果他們不這樣做，將面臨高達5,000萬歐元的罰款。
許多使用者都歡迎此一規範，它迫使像Facebook這樣的企業持續且迅速地對於仇恨言論、威脅或侮辱做出回應。不過，批評者卻擔憂，這項法律會長期傷害言論自由，因為，為了避免遭到罰款，線上服務的營運商可能會乾脆迅速且未經檢查即刪除遭申訴的內容。無國界記者（Reporters without Borders）則批評說，這項法律將使民間的營運商成為「網路上的新聞自由與資訊自由的法官」。
這項法律是否有用或者運作良好，如今尚無定論。在該法上路了大約半年之後，Facebook已經封鎖或刪除了遭到舉報的1,704則貼文中的362則，約莫每天一則。在Twitter上，265,000件遭投訴的發文中有26,000個被刪除。至於在YouTube上，則有214,827個影片遭人檢舉，其中有超過四分之一被刪除。
德國每天約有1,700萬人使用Facebook， 60萬人使用Twitter（2018年1月的統計）。

""Bottom rooted! Citizen's Speculation in German Education 7: Why are there so many ""hate speeches"" on the Internet?
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that ""hate speech"" is an English vocabulary, meaning ""hate speech."" They are often directed at people of different skin colors, different beliefs, different origins or different sexual orientations. People tend to use text, photos or symbols to depress these people.



Text: Manfred. Manfred Theisen
[Internet Bullying and Hate Speech]
Punishment: What can threaten bullies?
""Human dignity is inviolable."" This is clearly stated in Article 1 of the German Basic Law. However, cyber bullying is in violation of human dignity. How does the law protect victims from harm?
Article 107c of the Austrian Criminal Code stipulates that penalties will be imposed on the Internet, by telephone or by broadcasting or harassing others on radio and television. People are not allowed to harm someone's ""honour"" in front of others, or to allow others to obtain someone's photo, and the violators will face imprisonment for up to one year.
Although there is no special cyberbullying clause in Germany, bully often violates many provisions of the Criminal Law, such as insulting someone (Article 185), saying bad things about others (Article 186), forcing someone to do Something (Article 240), threatening someone (Article 241)*, and forwarding someone's recordings, videos, and photographs (Article 201)*, etc. without the consent of someone. Those who violate these rules will be fined, and may face up to five years in prison.
In Germany, adolescents are criminally responsible from the age of 14 but this does not mean that younger actors can retreat from their bodies (Editor's note: Taiwan is also the case). Civil liability applies to children over the age of seven. Therefore, the victim's parents can warn the other party through the lawyer and ask the other party to act. In other words, the bully must indicate in writing that he will not bully in the future. Parents of the bully must pay a high legal fee for this warning. If you refuse to sign a ban on bullying or another bullying, you must face further fines or even proceedings.
Not only photos and videos, but even someone's recordings, you must first obtain the consent of the other party before you disclose the materials.

Note: In Taiwan, the behavior of bullies may violate the provisions of the Criminal Code, including insults (Article 309), 诽谤 (Article 310), Coercion (Article 304), and intimidation (Articles 305 and 346) Deprive others of their freedom of movement (Article 302), harm others' bodies or health (Articles 277 and 278), etc.
Note: In Taiwan, violations of the right to personality violate the Civil Code (Article 195).


Why is there so much hatred on the Internet?
""Hate speech"" is an English vocabulary meaning ""hate speech."" They are often directed at people of different skin colors, different beliefs, different origins or different sexual orientations. People tend to use text, photos or symbols to depress these people.
All along, there are things like people of other ethnic groups. Such things are always wrong; whether they are aimed at Muslims, Jews, Christians, immigrants or aborigines. However, in the past 20 years, this hostility has increased.
There are two reasons for this: First, now that we have a social network, everyone can use it to quickly spread their opinions. Secondly, the ""911 incident"" that took place on September 11, 2001 completely changed the world. At that time, the radical Islamist assassin launched a terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in New York, USA. The terrorist attack caused about 3,000 deaths. Under such circumstances, the fear of a radical Islamist has exacerbated prejudice against Muslim immigrants.
Therefore, in German-speaking countries, hate speech is often directed at Muslims. This is also related to the increasing number of refugees.
The common practice of haters is that they distinguish between ""self"" and ""others"", and always give negative comments to others. If someone among others is caught stealing, the person who disseminates the hate speech will immediately infer the incident to the entire ethnic group to which the person belongs. Then, for example, all the refugees will automatically become thieves. The case was thus smeared into a general case. Not only that, but they are often refueled, and then the whole thing becomes a hate speech on the Internet.
Terror is the deliberate spread of fear and panic. To this end, in addition to murder, terrorists sometimes conduct public executions and release films for execution. Radical Islamists intend to transform the country into Islamic societies, strict Muslim societies in the name of God (God), or according to how they interpret Islam (Muslim religion). In the process they are not afraid to use violence.

How can you fight hate speech?
Hate speech is based on assertions, not on facts. The vast majority of unfounded assertions can be dealt with by facts and arguments against them. E.g:
Assertion: We cannot accommodate all refugees!
Refutation: In fact, we do not need to accommodate all refugees. Because most of the refugees have taken refuge in certain parts of their home country or fled to neighboring countries directly bordering the country. In terms of the proportion of the population, Lebanon has the highest proportion of refugees: in 2015, the denominator was also used for every 1,000 people. Lebanon has an average of 183 refugees per 1,000 people, 32 in Turkey, 17 in Sweden and 10 in Austria. There are only five people in Germany.
Assertion: Terrorists will follow our asylum-seekers into our country.
Refutation: Many refugees have lost relatives or friends in their hometowns because of terrorist attacks, and they themselves have even survived such attacks. They are as afraid as we are to have a terrorist attack in this country.
Assertion: Refugees are lazy!
Refutation: Refugees do not come to work in Germany, but because they are persecuted or have to flee war and terror. Therefore, our country gives them protection (asylum). However, licensed political asylum applicants can be engaged in certain occupations. The rest of the refugees can work in our country under certain conditions.
Assertion: Asylum policy is just wasting our money.
Refutation: Political asylum applicants can help us build better links with Arab countries in the future. Because they not only understand their own language and culture, but also their language and culture.
Assertion: Women wearing headscarves have no intention of integrating into our society.
Refutation: The motives for wearing a headscarf are not the same, and have nothing to do with the willingness to integrate. Many women wear headscarves for religious or cultural reasons. There is religious freedom in our democratic system, and this is also clearly stated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Assertion: There is no such thing as a massacre!
Refutation: There is something wrong! It is an indisputable and undeniable fact that Jews, homosexuals, Roma, Sinti and other ethnic groups have been massacred by the Nazis in the Third Reich. Anyone who denies this may be punished.
If you are looking for more arguments, or if you want to delve into hate speech, you may wish to obtain information on the website www.no-hate-speech.de funded by the German Federal Government.
The word asylum comes from ancient Greek, meaning ""safe."" Those who receive asylum have at least a certain degree of protection in their lives and a place where they can shelter from the wind. The word holocaust also comes from ancient Greek, meaning ""completely burned."" Since about 1970, this term has been used to refer to the murders committed against millions of European Jews during the Nazi period. The word ""shoah"" in Hebrew also has synonymous usage. Its original meaning is ""catastrophe"" and ""catastrophe."" Denying the Holocaust, the maximum penalty is up to five years.

What is the policy against online hatred?
Since January 1, 2018, the Internet Enforcement Act (NetzDG) has been in force in Germany. The law aims to curb hatred, incitement and deliberate false reporting on the Internet. In other words, it is designed to counter the evils associated with cyber bullying, hate speech, and fake news.
However, this law only applies to social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, not to instant messaging services or emails like WhatsApp. What are the specific provisions of this law?
If someone lodges a complaint on something on a network platform that is clearly illegal, such as hate speech, the platform operator is responsible for checking the content within 24 hours and, if necessary, removing the illegal content. If they don't, they will face a fine of up to 50 million euros.
Many users welcome this specification, which forces companies like Facebook to respond continuously and quickly to hate speech, threats or insults. However, critics worry that the law will hurt freedom of speech for a long time, because in order to avoid fines, online service operators may simply and quickly remove the content of the complaint without checking. Reporters without Borders criticized the law as making the private operators ""judges of freedom of the press and freedom of information on the Internet.""
Whether the law is useful or works well is still inconclusive. About half a year after the law took place, Facebook has blocked or deleted 362 of the 1,704 posts that were reported, about one day a day. On Twitter, 26,000 of the 265,000 complaints were deleted. As for YouTube, 214,827 videos were reported, and more than a quarter of them were deleted.
About 17 million people use Facebook every day in Germany, and 600,000 people use Twitter (statistics in January 2018).

Hu Yuanhui: The ever-changing digital communication technology has indeed created an incomparably convenient communication tool for human beings. It has indeed brought us into the mud of garbage and untrue information. The key is whether we can bring into play the positive effects brought about by new technologies through mature literacy. Potential, inhibiting the negative effects that new technologies may have. Without information, we certainly cannot participate in public life; but without quality and real information, we cannot have a good public life.
