        <b>The Chinese government has released a new set of rules that aim to combat gaming addiction across China, including no playing video games at night and a limit on screen time.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/business/china-video-game-ban-young.html">As reported by The New York Times</a>, the Chinese government claims that video games are responsible for a “rise in nearsightedness” and “poor academic performance.” As such, the government has implemented several rules in an attempt to curb gaming addiction in young people in China.</p>
      <p>The new rules, <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2019-11/05/c_1125194322.htm">which you can read by clicking the embedded link here</a>, officially ban all under-18s from playing video games between the hours of 10pm and 8am.</p>
      <p>Minors also can no longer play more than 90 minutes of games on weekdays, while they get a slightly more generous three hours on weekends and holidays.</p>
      <p>Along with limiting time spent playing, the regulations also impose a cap on spending. Young people in China are now restricted to a budget when buying items such as cosmetics or weapons in-game, with the cap varying between $28 and $57 a month based on the player’s age.</p>
      <p>The National Press and Publication Administration also said that all under-18s must now use real names and identification numbers when logging in.</p>
      <p>These new rules won’t be surprising to anyone who knows the slightest thing about China’s video game industry.</p>
      <p>China has always been notorious for censorship and over-regulation in the industry, doing things such as <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/chinas-censorship-of-kingdom-hearts-3s-winnie-the-pooh-is-both-insane-and-hilarious/">censoring Winnie the Pooh in Kingdom Hearts 3 with a bright white light</a>, revoking a studio’s business license and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/update-chinese-government-revokes-indievents-business-license-shuts-down-company/">shutting down the studio just for depicting Chinese president Xi Jinping as Winnie the Pooh</a>, and banning <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/china-bans-blood-imperial-history-and-mahjong-from-video-games/">blood, imperial history, and Mahjong from video games</a>.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, gaming addiction is starting to become an increasingly worrying threat across the entire world. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/nhs-to-open-its-first-specialist-clinic-for-gaming-addiction/">The NHS in the UK recently opened its first specialist clinic that aims to target gaming addiction</a> and The World Health Organization classified ‘gaming disorder’ as a mental health condition for the first time.</p>
      <p>Whether these new rules will actually help in curbing gaming addiction, though, is yet to be seen.</p>
