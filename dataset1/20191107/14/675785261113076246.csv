Gareth Southgate has kept faith with James Maddison after naming a 27-man squad to face Montenegro and Kosovo.
Leicester midfielder Maddison was sweating on his place after being pictured in a casino while England played Czech Republic last month despite being sent home ill from the last squad.
England boss Southgate was unhappy with Maddison and warned him about being his future behaviour but has resisted any temptation to drop him out of the squad.
But there is no place for Aston Villa's Jack Grealish and Everton defender Michael Keane is the big casualty after England’s defeat in Czech Republic.
Southgate has been checking on Grealish but the Villa midfielder has been carrying an injury, although expects to play this weekend.

Manchester City's fit-again John Stones returns while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - with four goals in his last three starts - returns to the squad after missing out last time.
Fabian Delph is also in the squad along with Ross Barkley who has been out of the Chelsea starting line-up for the past month while Callum Hudson-Odoi is promoted back to the seniors.
