      <h1>Baker Mayfield on Shaving Handlebar Mustache: 'I Didn't Deserve It' | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has not lost his starting job due to his struggles on the field.</h2>

      <p>However, his poor play has cost him his handlebar mustache.</p>
      <p>Mayfield showed up to Empower Field in Denver with a full bear beard:</p>

      <p>However, given that he was undefeated while rocking the handlebar mustache, Mayfield decided to go back to that:</p>

      <p>Sadly though, for Mayfield and Browns fans, the handlebar mustache did not produce victory. After Cleveland’s 24-19 loss to the Broncos, Mayfield decided he did not “deserve” the handlebars, and shaved them off.</p>

      <p>Incredibly, though Mayfield had shaved twice in the same day producing two entirely different looks, his head coach Freddie Kitchens said he didn’t notice.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know he shaved the day of the game,” Kitchens <a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/2019/11/06/mayfield-mustache-i-didnt-deserve-it/">said</a>. “I don’t really look at faces that much in terms of facial hair.”</p>
