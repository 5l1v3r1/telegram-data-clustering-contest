Soul Trailer: Pixar Cues Up Your Next Existential Crisis
07 Nov 2019, 14:49 by Jackson McHenry



“What do you want to be known for on earth?” The trailer for Pixar’s Soul asks you as soon as it starts, with absolutely no chill. The movie stars Jamie Foxx as Joe Gardner, a middle-school band teacher who dreams of playing jazz, who takes a wrong step one day, falls through a manhole, and ends up in some mysterious spirit universe with a character named 22 voiced by Tina Fey. Gardner is also the animation studio’s first black lead. Pete Docter, of Inside Out, directed Soul, which similarly promises to go to weird existential places with cute characters Disney can also make bank selling as toys. The movie premieres June 19, 2020, just in time for a nice summer emotional breakdown.
