      <h2>Microsoft's latest tablet features a lot of smart design decisions when it comes to ease-of-repair.</h2>

      <p>It turns out Microsoft's new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/02/microsoft-surface-pro-x-arm-announce/">Surface Pro X</a> represents a new direction for the company in than just one way. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+X+Teardown/127703?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=110619_PR_Microsoft%20Surface%20Pro%20X%20Teardown&amp;utm_content=110619_PR_Microsoft%20Surface%20Pro%20X%20Teardown+CID_94e58aa947dcddfb7badb42017b5f0f2&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=Microsoft%20Surface%20Pro%20X%20Teardown">According to DIY heroes iFixit</a>, the device is one of the most repairable tablets on the market currently thanks to a couple of smart design decisions.</p>
      <p>It starts with how Microsoft has built the SSD into the Surface Pro X. All you'll need to access the compartment that holds the drive is a SIM eject tool -- a paperclip will also do in a pinch. That's it: you don't need to pry off the display to get at the internal storage. There a lot of reasons this is great, but the thing most future Pro X owners will likely appreciate is that they'll be able to upgrade the SSD on their own easily.</p>

      <p>The display is also much easier to separate from the main body than with a lot of other tablets. You don't need to apply heat or solvents to the foam adhesive to make it workable. That said, you'll still need a steady hand and nerves of steel to remove the screen, but its a significant departure from how most manufacturers build their tablets nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Other repairability highpoints include that you'll only need a Torx screwdriver to remove all the screws, and the fact that most of the components, including the two USB-C ports, are modular. "It would seem that Microsoft has placed at least one foot on the repairability trainâ€”between this Pro X and the Laptop 3, we can hardly believe all the repair-focused changes they've made!" says iFixit.</p>

      <p>After completing the teardown, the company awarded the Surface Pro X a repairability score of six out of 10 (a higher score indicates an easier to repair device). To put that score in perspective, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad+Pro+11-Inch+Teardown/115457">iPad Pro</a> earned a three out of 10. Repairability, like water resistance, is one of those things that isn't important until it becomes the most important aspect of a device. Eventually, something in your device will break -- usually at the worst possible moment. When it does, you might appreciate the fact that you can do the repair yourself.</p>
