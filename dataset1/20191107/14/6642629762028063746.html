      <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury's expects to trade well in the run-up to Christmas but fears a consumer hangover in the new year if <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> is unresolved, its boss said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> called a snap December 12 election in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-Kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> is currently due to leave the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> on January 31, though that could change depending on the result of the election.</p>
      <p>"All our experience will say that people will celebrate Christmas, they always do. We would expect that we'll do well over Christmas," Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe told reporters.</p>
      <p>"But depending on the outcome of the election and how quickly we get the whole Brexit situation resolved, there may well be a hangover into the new calendar year," he said.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's reported a 15 percent fall in first-half profit, blaming the combined impact of the phasing of cost savings, higher marketing costs and tough weather comparatives with last year which impacted on sales.</p>
      <p>The 150-year-old group did, however, forecast that the second-half profits would benefit from the annualisation of last year's staff wage increase and normalisation of marketing costs and weather comparatives.</p>
      <p>It said it was on track to make analysts' profit consensus for the full 2019-20 year of 584 million pounds ($751.2m), down from 601 million pounds ($770m) in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>The first-half profit fall comes as Sainsbury's tries to rebuild confidence in its strategy following a botched attempt to take over rival Asda. UK's competition regulator blocked the agreed 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4bn) deal in April and Sainsbury's shares have fallen 34 percent over the last year.</p>
      <p>In September, Coupe put cost-cutting and paying off debt at the heart of a new plan designed to show Sainsbury's can prosper on its own.</p>
      <p>The group made an underlying pretax profit of 238 million pounds ($305m) in the 28 weeks to September 21 - ahead of analysts' average forecast of 232 million pounds ($297m) but down from 279 million pounds ($358m) made in the same period last year. Group sales fell 0.2 percent to 16.86 billion pounds ($21.6bn), with like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, down 1 percent.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's reported a statutory pretax profit of just 9 million pounds ($11.5m) for the first half. That reflected 229 million pounds ($293.5m) of one-off costs, the bulk of which follows a review of its store estate.</p>
      <p>Shares in the group were up 0.3 percent at 09:57 GMT.</p>
      <p>Coupe said he was hopeful Sainsbury's shares would be rated afresh once Brexit is resolved and consumer confidence improves.</p>
