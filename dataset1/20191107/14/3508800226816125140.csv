【導讀】受困與自由的辯證：關於《全球化的時代》
“Always think [like an] Olympian!”——Benedict O. Anderson （1936-2015）
1.
班納尼克．安德森是一個裝了一肚子故事，而且很喜歡講故事的人，每次和他見面聊天都有聽不完的故事，彷彿在讀〈一千零一夜〉一般。這個有趣的業餘說書人常跟我說，他這一輩子最想寫的是小說，不是理論書，而這本《全球化的時代》應該是他一生所寫過最接近小說的文本了。它最初的書名《三旗之下》（Under Three Flags）看起來就像是小說標題，而他本人更明白說這本書是用「蒙太奇」和「連載小說」手法寫成的。所以，寫了《想像的共同體》的民族主義理論大師到了晚年終於放棄枯燥乏味的學術論文，（令人興奮地）改行寫通俗小說，變成一個專業的說書人了嗎？
我們的大師終究沒有當成專業的說書人。即使書名像小說，敘事像小說，情節戲劇化，這終究不是一本小說，因為它所敘述的不是虛構 （fiction），而是歷史 （history）：《全球化的時代》是一冊用小說敘事手法寫成的歷史著作。同樣的，大師也沒有擺脫《想像的共同體》的偉大陰影，因為這部小說化的歷史所敘述的，正是該書第七章所提到的「最後一波」反殖民民族主義的一個個案 ——最後一波的第一個個案，也就是初期的菲律賓民族主義。換句話說，《全球化的時代》可以被理解為《想像的共同體》的延伸，或者《想像的共同體》理論架構下的一個經驗個案研究。
安德森之所以用小說——而且是十九世紀後半通俗連載小說——的方式來寫菲律賓民族主義史，除了出於大師對跨越文類邊界無法壓抑的遊戲衝動之外，最主要的目的應該是要向本書的英雄之一，菲律賓最初的民族主義者與小說家荷西．黎剎（José Rizal, 1861-1896）致敬。換句話說，安德森以他書中主人公當年寫小說的手法，書寫了這位英雄和他同時代人的歷史。對於任何寫作者而言，我們實在難以想像有比此更複雜 （sophisticated）而尊崇的恭維了。然而安德森對敘事選擇的思慮並不止於此。如果翁貝托‧艾柯（Umberto Eco）仿作歷史文獻的目的是虛構，安德森則挪用歷史性虛構文本的敘事來重建歷史，而這種重層、反身的書寫方式 （reflexive writing）其實有著方法論上的考量。
2.
《全球化的時代》既是《想像的共同體》的延伸之作，自然也承襲了後者的比較史方法。請容我在此引述筆者與班納迪克．安德森2011年在東京對話時對這個著名的研究途徑的描述：
安德森教授研究民族主義的途徑或方法論可以說是一種比較史，或者是比較歷史社會學，但它又不只是一種比較史，而是以全球為範圍的比較史。也就是說，那是一種世界史式的比較分析。這種途徑最關鍵的特色之一，是以鳥瞰的眼光看歷史，看到大局，看到相似的事件與現象不僅在不同的地方各自向前展開 （unfold diachronically），彼此之間也有共時性的連結。如此一來，在特定地方發生的事件，往往也成為一個更大個世界史過程的一部分，而這個過程有可以辨識的機制與模式，因此也是可以解釋的。在他幾年前寫給我的信中，安德森教授提醒我要「永遠像奧林帕斯諸神一樣思考！」（Always think Olympian！），因此我們不妨稱這種方式為「奧林帕斯山頂的觀點」（a view from the top of Olympus）。
當然，即使是同樣來自奧林帕斯山頂的眺望，視野所聚焦之處依然有全體與局部之別。作為一部解釋民族主義起源與全球擴散的總論，《想像的共同體》的比較史關注全球性歷史運動的擴散 （diffusion），而《全球化的時代》的比較史則是一種全球史觀點的個案研究——一篇個論。不過，它不是當代全球史研究中常見的「定點觀測」（日本學者駒込武語，指從特定的地方個案觀察全球史過程），反而著重於鳥瞰、並置、比較、移動、連結─具體而言，安德森在本書中經由探索、重建幾位具有全球視野 （cosmopolitan-minded）的民族主義者，如小說家黎剎、人類學家陸雷彝 （Isabelo de los Reyes） 和組織家彭西 （Mariano Ponce）等人在世界不同地域之間的物理性與精神性移動，試圖重新揭露地方性個案（主要是菲律賓，其次為古巴）所具有的全球史特性與國際化性格。
3.
安德森把他在本書中所描繪的亞洲民族主義者漫遊世界——全球移動——的脈絡，也就是十九世紀末交通與通訊科技飛躍式進展的時代，稱為「早期全球化」（early globalization）。但他在書中所未明言的事實是，構成所謂「早期全球化」脈絡的，正是十九世紀末葉新科技條件下形成的全球殖民帝國網絡與其衍生的全球反殖民運動網絡。換句話說，黎剎和他的民族主義夥伴們在本書中，是完全依循著由十九世紀末新帝國主義（new imperialism）所創造的核心與邊陲交錯連結而形成的路徑而展開世界漫遊的。
哈佛大學的經濟學家丹尼・羅德里克（Dani Rodrik）對全球化歷史的分析，為本書所討論的「早期全球化」提供了一個重要的政治經濟學註解。他指出穩定的全球化秩序的形成需要同時滿足兩個條件——市場全球化與政治（治理）的全球化。十九世紀末葉的初期全球化（他稱為「第一次偉大的全球化」）得以達成某種穩定的主因，是帝國主義 （尤其是大英帝國）創造了某種市場全球化所不可或缺的公共財，也就是跨國、廣域的治理結構之故。
當代資本全球化所以處處引發衝突、乃至瀕臨崩解，原因就在市場全球化雖完成，治理全球化卻難產之故——當代帝國秩序正當性不再，但治理全球化的替代性方案（如聯合國）也遭遇失敗。羅德里克的洞見揭露了隱藏在本書敘事背後的一個重要的歷史辯證：帝國主義秩序（及其背後的全球資本主義體系），既是激發殖民地民族主義興起的不可避的他者，同時也是使殖民地民族主義者得以「全球漫遊」，獲得其國際化性格不可或缺的政治條件。
4.
現在讓我們回到《全球化的時代》。很明顯地，本書所討論的「早期全球化」主要指的是政治和思想層面的全球化，而當代政治經濟學所謂的資本全球化過程則隱身幕後，成為本書的背景或潛文本 （subtext）。在概念層次上，安德森在這本書中想傳遞的主要理論訊息或許可以歸納為以下圖式：
十九世紀末西方帝國主義秩序所建構的一個跨國或跨地域移動的全球網絡，如何既使（一）帝國中心的統治者得以遠程投射國力，跨海支配殖民地，同時也使（二）殖民地人民得以移動、進入到帝國中心，學習帝國文明 （亦即薩伊德〔Edward Said〕所說的「航入」〔voyage in〕），使 （三）各帝國中心內部的反對勢力相互移動 （如馬克思主義者和無政府主義者從德國、西班牙向巴黎、倫敦亡命／移動），最終促成了（四）中心與中心、邊陲與中心、以及邊陲與邊陲的反體系勢力（anti-systemic forces）的連結 （如不同殖民地民族主義之間，以及中心的無政府主義與邊陲的反殖民民族主義的結盟）。
那麼具體而言，本書所談的這些帝國，這些中心與邊陲，這些反體系勢力又指涉些甚麼呢？
首先，本書涵蓋的時間範圍，主要是十九世紀的最後二十年，也就是1880年代到1900年代。這個時期恰好是歐洲史上所謂「新帝國主義」興起，也就是歐洲各國開始競相展開對外殖民擴張 （colonial scramble，尤其是在非洲大陸，但不限於非洲）以壓制國內勞動階級挑戰的整合民族主義 （integral nationalism） 時期。這個階段的帝國主義競爭，建構了一個重疊綿密的勢力網絡，幾乎覆蓋了整個地球。
其次，這個時期同時也見證了新舊帝國的交替，最重要的是美利堅帝國取代西班牙帝國在南北美洲興起，以及在東北亞日本帝國的興起與大陸的清帝國（和俄羅斯帝國）的衰落。
第三，在這個時期，無政府主義運動經由帝國網絡從歐陸快速擴張到新世界、亞、非殖民地，並且因其鮮明的國際主義精神與強烈的反帝、反殖民立場而在自由主義與馬克思主義之前，率先與殖民地的民族主義建立了理論與政治同盟關係。 安德森之所以選擇「無政府主義者與反殖民想像」作為本書副標題，就是刻意要連結這個左翼思想脈絡，來為長期蒙受來自自稱左派庸俗論者「封閉、保守」污名的殖民地民族主義翻案。
本書討論的主要個案，是在西班牙帝國統治末期——或者應該說崩潰前夜——的東亞殖民地菲律賓出現的民族主義。安德森在書中追蹤、重建了初期的幾位菲律賓民族主義者在西班牙帝國轄下不同地區的移動與連結，如他們在帝國中心馬德里與自由主義者與共和主義者的合作，受到另一個帝國中心巴塞隆納的無政府主義者的啟發，以及和另一個帝國邊陲古巴的反殖民民族主義的結盟等。另一方面，安德森也追蹤了這些菲律賓民族主義者在同時代諸帝國中心，如柏林、巴黎、布魯塞爾、倫敦，乃至東北亞的東京，甚至位處歐洲之外的帝國邊陲香港之間的移動與連結——他們如何受到時代思潮的啟蒙、如何就地組織、如何海外結盟、如何書寫、如何流亡、如何返鄉，最終如何讓祖國進入了世界的移動與連結。
安德森以這幾位特出的全球格局民族主義者，以及他們在移動過程中連結的人物，作為節點 （nodal points），將在每個節點發生的故事、故事與故事的交融碰撞，以蒙太奇手法拼貼，最後連結成一幅「作為世界史的地方史」圖像。當然，在故事的結局之中，西班牙帝國雖然滅亡了，菲律賓卻沒有獲得獨立，因為新的美利堅帝國取代了西班牙，再度殖民了菲律賓。安德森筆下「早期全球化」的時代所見證的，只是第一波反殖民民族主義的興起，而不是它的完成。
5.
最後，我們必須談一下安德森在《全球化時代》書中對於黎剎兩部小說的討論，因為他在這裡的討論不只直接呼應了《想像的共同體》所提出的現代小說作為民族想像之媒介的著名命題，同時也為本文所再三致意的「全球漫遊的民族主義者」的精神世界提供了一個絕佳例證。
荷西．黎剎被世人尊為菲律賓民族之父，然而他是一個非常奇妙的民族之父。他只有很少的實際政治經驗，從不曾像孫文或尼赫魯一樣直接領導一個組織性民族革命運動，既沒有甘地般的宗教性奇理斯瑪（charisma），也不是蔣渭水式的群眾魅力領袖，更沒有喬治．華盛頓或本書另一位英雄，古巴獨立之父荷西．馬蒂（José Marti, 1853-1895）那種指揮武裝革命的赫赫軍功。他短暫的一生所做的最重要的事，是為一個尚未出現的菲律賓民族寫作——主要是小說，然後透過他的小說想像（imagine）了菲律賓民族的容貌，並且召喚（summon）出後來者著手建構民族的政治行動。
在《全球化的時代》書中，安德森提醒了我們，黎剎敘述民族的小說從來就不只是狹隘的本土主義敘事，而是遠離故土，從世界想像家園，在世界召喚祖國，將世界帶進祖國，不斷以菲律賓和世界相互參照、比較、聯想、置換的全球性敘事。也因如此，黎剎的小說完美體現了近代亞、非民族主義的世界性根源：民族主義，其實是一種觀看世界的方式。
我們可以將黎剎先後完成的政治小說二部曲，分別理解為他對民族的 「想像」以及「召喚」。
第一部《不許犯我》（Noli me Tangere，1887，拉丁文原意為「別碰我」），是黎剎對菲律賓與菲律賓民族的想像。在小說中，他以寫實而略帶嘲諷的筆法，描繪了一個從殖民官僚、墮落神職人員、本地協力者、新興土著資產階級、反抗知識份子到少女、農民、盜墓者、盜匪、與勞動者等等，包含了各行各業，各個階層、族群、年齡與性別的繁複圖像，而這個圖像構成了一個他稱之為「菲律賓」的整體（social whole）。
換言之，黎剎以生花妙筆「想像」出了菲律賓民族的容顏。安德森指出，黎剎是第一個透過現代小說的敘事將菲律賓民族的全體像表現出來的本地作者，因此可謂「第一個菲律賓人」（the first Filipino）。事實上，這個用小說敘述民族（narrating the nation）的驚人語言行動，也使他成為近代東亞最初，而且最具創意的反殖民民族主義者。
在第二部作《起義者》（El Filibusterismo，1891）之中，黎剎一反第一部作的寫實主義風格，將他在長住歐洲時期所經歷或見聞的學生示威與無政府主義者四處「以行動宣傳」（propaganda by deed）的恐怖暗殺行動等當時在菲律賓難以想像的場景移入、置換到這個殖民地社會之中。此外，他也在這部作品中大量暗示了1890年代全球地緣政治的種種衝突。借用安德森生動的語言來說，黎剎在《起義者》之中「想像了（第一部作中所描繪的菲律賓社會）在政治上的解體，以及整個統治菁英的瀕臨消滅」，而且這是一個空前的想像——菲律賓人從來沒有想過殖民秩序解體，統治集團消滅的可能，但黎剎的小說大膽地、生動地，而且激烈地提示了這個可能性。
如同安德森所言，黎剎這個想像的民族革命在現實中產生了巨大的後果，「彷彿這個天才的精靈已經逃出瓶子」，而小說中奮袂而起的反叛英雄開始獲得了他們自己的生命。這就是《起義者》的功能：它召喚了行動者。深受黎剎小說感動與鼓舞，終於在1896年揭竿而起，領導武裝革命，並在兩年後暫時終結了三百五十年的西班牙殖民統治的民族英雄波尼費希歐 （Andres Bonifacio，1863——1897，也是本書英雄之一），豈不是黎剎筆下「起義者」的化身嗎？在這裡，小說與小說家分道揚鑣了：小說家黎剎並不支持武裝鬥爭，然而他在小說中想像的武裝鬥爭，卻鼓舞、召喚、誘發了現實中終極的反抗與決裂行動。
6.
就像許多十九世紀的通俗連載小說一般，我們這本《全球化時代》講述的故事也是「未完待續」的，因為它終結於新帝國與再殖民，而不是殖民地菲律賓的獨立。然而這本書必然是未完待續的，因為它講述的是帝國夾縫之中的弱小民族的故事，而未完成、不可完成正是帝國夾縫中弱小民族主義的地緣政治宿命。
然而，這篇奇妙的文本完整、鮮明地描繪了一個在早期全球化過程中興起的反殖民民族主義的原型——受胎於全球化（帝國主義與殖民主義），因而也深受全球化形塑的一種開放的，高度意識到當代世界，非常重視相互連結、具有強烈國際主義精神的民族主義。這個圖像徹底顛覆了通俗論述對民族主義封閉性格的描繪與指責，因為它捕捉到全球化時代，殖民邊陲如何辨證地運用了帝國創造的全球路徑進行抵抗。於是我們知道，原來安德森在奧林帕斯山頂上看到的景色，是一種雙重結構：它顯示了地緣政治對弱者的嚴厲限制 （如帝國夾縫），但同時也提示了弱者的出路 （反向利用帝國創造的全球網路進行國際連結與逆襲）。
我們所身處的當代距離本書所講述的時代已經超過百年之久，可說是一個「晚期全球化」（late globalization)）的時代。在晚期全球化的時代中，帝國雖然不再具有正當性，但新自由主義失控而不均衡的全球資本擴張與全球治理的失敗，反而誘發了新一波帝國爭霸。對地緣政治的弱小者而言，晚期全球化是一個高度不確定的、危險的年代，因為帝國夾縫結構不動如山，新舊宗主國交替與再殖民的宿命如恆。然而安德森在《全球化的時代》裡所提示的帝國與殖民地的辯證，我們在奧林帕斯山頂上看到的制約與逃逸、壓迫與自由的雙重結構，在這個時代卻也顯得更清晰明確。
如同羅德里克所言，晚期全球化是一個「極端全球化」（hyper-globalization）的年代，沒有全球治理制約的資本到處擴張、肆虐，並且誘發了激烈的地緣政治衝突，把全世界緊緊地結合在一個共同災難之中。然而這個地獄般景象的另一面，卻是解放與自由的承諾：極端全球化同時意味著帝國更受制約，不易採取片面行動，而邊陲弱者的國際化程度則更加深，國際知識愈豐富，國際連結愈強。在帝國正當性下降的條件下，這意味著今日弱者抵抗、逃逸的可能性更高。
這就是東亞兩個島嶼邊陲——台灣與香港——此時此刻正在上演的故事。在晚期全球化的時代，我們不得不繼續承受宗主國交替與連續殖民的命運，但我們卻也因極端全球整合而吸收了大量關於世界的知識，結交了無數跨國的友人，也建立了巨大的國際連結網絡——如今我們的國際化程度已經遠遠超過一個世紀多以前的黎剎。在晚期全球化的時代，每一個台灣人，每一個香港人都是漫遊世界的黎剎。如果一個黎剎就開啟了想像民族之路，那麼數以百萬、數以千萬計的黎剎可以成就甚麼？帝國強大而脆弱，因為帝國困守大陸，但島嶼卻擁有全世界。受困與自由的辯證——這就是班納迪克．安德森這本看似難解的《全球化時代》給我們的啟示。

謹以此文向所有正在流水革命中奮戰的香港「巴絲」——世界的香港人，以及所有獻身於保衛台灣民主獨立的台灣人——世界的台灣人——致敬。

貧富差距，階級剝奪，政治失序…十九世紀末就像今天，「全球化」帶來更大的不平等。於是，人類史上第一次，反抗者們也彼此連結起來，讓反抗運動「全球化」！

最有既視感的歷史與比較政治研究《想像的共同體》作者班納迪克．安德森為二十一世紀而寫！
本書是安德森在二十一世紀初，對十九世紀晚期國際政治研究的一本專著。以十九世紀末的三位菲律賓人，小說家黎剎、民俗學者陸雷彝、旅居日本的革命份子彭西為主角，隨著他們一生經歷，綜觀當時的國際局勢與殖民地的革命。
在安德森的研究中，十九世紀的世界已經透過電報、輪船旅行等技術被連成一張大網絡。相比於今天，當時可稱為「早期全球化」。而這個早期全球化的時代，就像今天一樣有種種的問題：貧富差距，階級剝奪，政治集權，民主運動遭遇暴力鎮壓，資源集中在大國，地方利益長期被榨取… 。「全球化」時代的到來造成更大的不平等。但這也帶給殖民地人民，運用全球化網絡進行革命的機會。史上第一次，世界各地的反抗者們彼此連結，讓反抗運動「全球化」。
班納迪克．安德森以蒙太奇手法，跟隨三位主角走向國際的旅程，描繪出十九世紀三個互相交疊的世界：第一個世界是1860-90年代之間的國際世界體系，掌握在如俾斯麥等強權領袖的手中。第二個世界是全球左派、國際無政府主義的世界，在其中活躍的是來自各國、跨國界移動串連的革命份子。第三個世界則是苟延殘喘的西班牙帝國，和它的兩個殖民地：古巴和菲律賓。在這些交疊的世界中，出現了三位非凡的菲律賓人物----小說家黎剎、民俗學者陸雷彝、旅日革命份子彭斯。安德森以他們的生命經歷為軸，展開一張十九世紀末波瀾壯闊的世界畫卷。
在本書中，讀者會隨著三位主角的旅程，遇見各種多采多姿的人物，如中國的孫中山、梁啟超，日本的末廣鐵腸，古巴的馬蒂等，都在其中出現。這些來自世界各地的革命分子，在由帝國主義秩序構建出的全球化舞台上相遇，共同譜寫一個反抗殖民、爭取主權，未完待續的故事…。

""The Era of Globalization"" Wu Ruiren's Guide: A Case Study of the Philippines Experience under the Theoretical Framework of ""Imagined Community""
07 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Selected Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the empire is strong and fragile, because the empire is trapped on the mainland, but the island has the world. Dialectics of being trapped and free - this is Benadic. Anderson's seemingly intractable ""Times of Globalization"" gives us inspiration.

[Introduction] Dialectics of Being trapped and free: About ""The Age of Globalization""
""Always think [like an] Olympian!"" - Benedict O. Anderson (1936-2015)
1.
Bannaknik. Anderson is a story with a stomach story, and he likes to tell stories. Every time he meets and chats with him, there are stories that can’t be heard, as if reading a thousand and one nights. This interesting amateur storyteller often tells me that the most he wants to write in his life is a novel, not a theory book, and this ""Time of Globalization"" should be the text that he wrote the closest to a novel in his life. Its original title, Under Three Flags, looks like a novel title, and he himself understands that the book was written in the form of ""montage"" and ""serial novels."" Therefore, the master of the nationalist theory who wrote the ""Imagined Community"" finally gave up the boring academic papers in his later years. (Excitingly) diverted to write popular novels and became a professional storyteller?
After all, our masters did not become professional storytellers. Even if the title is like a novel, a narrative like a novel, or a dramatic drama, this is not a novel, because it is not a fiction, but a history: The Age of Globalization is a book with a novel narrative. A historical work written in a tactical way. In the same way, the master did not get rid of the great shadow of the ""Imagined Community"", because this novelized history is the case of the ""last wave"" of anti-colonial nationalism mentioned in the seventh chapter of the book. - The first case of the last wave, the initial Philippine nationalism. In other words, ""The Age of Globalization"" can be understood as an extension of the ""Imagined Community"" or an empirical case study under the theoretical framework of the ""Imagined Community.""
Anderson’s use of fiction—and the popular series of novels in the second half of the nineteenth century—to write the history of Philippine nationalism, except for the impulsive impulses that masters can’t suppress across literary boundaries, the main purpose should be One of the heroes to the book, the original nationalist and novelist of the Philippines, Jose. Salute (José Rizal, 1861-1896) pays tribute. In other words, Anderson wrote the history of the hero and his contemporaries by writing the novels in his book. For any writer, it's hard to imagine a more complimented and respectful compliment. However, Anderson’s consideration of narrative choice does not stop there. If Umberto Eco's imitation of historical documents is fictional, Anderson uses the narrative of historical fictional texts to reconstruct history, and this reflexive writing is actually methodological. Considerations.
2.
""The Age of Globalization"" is not only an extension of the ""Imagined Community"", but naturally inherits the latter's comparative history method. Please let me quote the author and Benadic here. Anderson’s description of this famous research path during the Tokyo dialogue in 2011:
Professor Anderson's approach or methodology for studying nationalism can be said to be a comparative history or a comparative historical sociology, but it is not just a comparative history, but a comparative history of the world. In other words, it is a comparative analysis of world history. One of the most crucial features of this approach is to look at history from a bird's eye view, see the big picture, and see similar events and phenomena not only unfold diachronically in different places, but also have synchronicity with each other. Link. As a result, events occurring in specific places often become part of a larger process of world history, and this process has identifiable mechanisms and models that can be explained. In a letter he wrote to me a few years ago, Professor Anderson reminded me to ""Always think like Olympus!"" (Always think Olympian!), so we might as well call this way ""Olympus ""a view from the top of Olympus"".
Of course, even if it is also from the top of Olympus, there is still a difference between the whole and the part. As a general comment explaining the origin of nationalism and global diffusion, the comparative history of ""Imagined Community"" focuses on the diffusion of global historical movements, while the comparative history of ""Times of Globalization"" is a global historical perspective. Case study - a monograph. However, it is not a common ""fixed-point observation"" in contemporary global history research (the Japanese scholar 驹込武语 refers to the process of observing global history from specific local cases), but instead focuses on bird's-eye view, juxtaposition, comparison, movement, and connection-specifically In this book, Anderson explores and reconstructs several cosmopolitan-minded nationalists, such as the novelist Rizal, the anthropologist Isabelo de los Reyes, and the organizer, Mariano Ponce. The physical and spiritual movements of people in different parts of the world attempt to re-expose the global history and international character of local cases (mainly the Philippines, followed by Cuba).
3.
Anderson puts the era of the Asian nationalist roaming world, the global movement, described in this book, the era of the rapid advancement of transportation and communication technology in the late 19th century, called early globalization. . But what he did not say in the book is that the network that constitutes the so-called ""early globalization"" is the network of global colonial empire formed under the conditions of Yexin Science and Technology at the end of the 19th century and the network of global anti-colonial movements derived from it. In other words, in this book, Rizal and his nationalist partners roam the world in full accordance with the path formed by the intertwined connections between the core and the border created by the new imperialism of the late nineteenth century.
Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard University, provides an important political economics commentary on the ""early globalization"" discussed in this book. He pointed out that the formation of a stable globalization order needs to satisfy two conditions at the same time: globalization of the market and globalization of politics (governance). The early globalization of the late nineteenth century (he called ""the first great globalization"") was able to achieve some kind of stable main reason, and imperialism (especially the British Empire) created an indispensable part of market globalization. The public finances are the governance structure of transnational and wide-area.
The globalization of contemporary capital has caused conflicts and even collapsed. The reason is that although the globalization of the market is completed, the governance of globalization is difficult to produce. The legitimacy of the contemporary imperial order is no longer, but alternative solutions to governance globalization (such as The United Nations has also suffered failure. Roderick's insight reveals an important historical dialect behind the narrative of the book: the imperialist order (and the global capitalist system behind it) is both an inevitable other inspiring the rise of colonial nationalism and a colonial nation. The ambassadors were able to ""role globally"" and gain political conditions that are indispensable for their international character.
4.
Let us now return to the Age of Globalization. Obviously, the ""early globalization"" discussed in this book mainly refers to the globalization of politics and ideas. The so-called capital globalization process of contemporary political economy is hidden behind the scenes and becomes the background or subtext of this book. . At the conceptual level, the main theoretical messages that Anderson wants to convey in this book may be summarized as follows:
At the end of the nineteenth century, a global network of transnational or trans-regional movements constructed by the Western imperialist order enabled (1) the rulers of the Imperial Center to project national power remotely, cross the sea to dominate the colonies, and at the same time enable the (2) colonial people to Move, enter the center of the empire, learn the imperial civilization (also known as ""voyage in"" by Edward Said), so that (3) the opposition forces within the various imperial centers move to each other (such as Marxism) And anarchists from Germany, Spain to Paris, London, desperate/moving), which ultimately led to (iv) the connection between the center and the center, the border and the center, and the anti-systemic forces of Bentham and Bentham (eg Between different colonial nationalisms, and the alliance between central anarchism and Bentham’s anti-colonial nationalism).
So specifically, the empire discussed in this book, these centers and Bentham, what do these anti-system forces refer to?
First, the time frame covered in this book is mainly the last two decades of the nineteenth century, from the 1880s to the 1900s. This period happens to be the rise of the so-called ""new imperialism"" in European history, that is, the integration of nationalism in which European countries began to compete for colonial expansion (especially on the African continent, but not limited to Africa) to suppress the challenges of the domestic working class ( Integral nationalism) period. The imperialist competition at this stage constructed an overlapping network of forces that covered almost the entire planet.
Secondly, this period also witnessed the alternation of the old and new empire. The most important thing was that the American Empire replaced the Spanish Empire in North and South America, and the rise of the Japanese Empire in Northeast Asia and the decline of the mainland's Qing Empire (and the Russian Empire).
Third, during this period, the anarchist movement rapidly expanded from Europe to the New World, Asia and Africa, through the Empire Network, and in liberalism and Marxism because of its distinctive internationalist spirit and strong anti-imperialist and anti-colonial stance. Before, he took the lead in establishing a theoretical and political alliance with the colonial nationalism. Anderson's choice of ""anarchist and anti-colonial imagination"" as the subtitle of this book is to deliberately link this left-wing ideology to the long-term refusal of colonial nationalism from the ""closed, conservative"" stigma of self-proclaimed leftist vulgarists.
The main case discussed in this book is the nationalism that emerged in the East Asian colonies of the Philippines at the end of the Spanish empire, or the eve of the collapse. In the book, Anderson traces and reconstructs the movements and connections of several early Filipino nationalists in different parts of the Spanish Empire, such as their cooperation with liberals and republicans in the Imperial Center of Madrid, and another imperial center. Inspired by the anarchists of Barcelona and the alliance with another anti-colonial nationalism by Cuba. On the other hand, Anderson also traced the movement of these Filipino nationalists in the centers of contemporary empires, such as Berlin, Paris, Brussels, London, and even Tokyo in Northeast Asia, and even outside the border between Europe and the Empire. Links - how they are inspired by the trend of the times, how to organize on the spot, how to form alliances overseas, how to write, how to exile, how to return home, and ultimately how to let the motherland into the movement and connection of the world.
Anderson uses these unique global pattern nationalists, as well as the characters they connect in the movement, as nodal points, colliding with stories, stories and stories that occur at each node, with montage The collage is finally linked into an image of ""local history as a world history."" Of course, in the ending of the story, although the Spanish Empire died, the Philippines did not gain independence, because the new American Empire replaced Spain and re-colonized the Philippines. What Edson’s ""early globalization"" era witnessed was only the rise of the first wave of anti-colonial nationalism, not its completion.

Finally, we must talk about Anderson's discussion of the two novels of Rizal in the book ""Times of Globalization"", because his discussion here not only directly echoes the modern novels proposed by the ""Imagined Community"" as the medium of national imagination. The famous proposition also provides an excellent example of the spiritual world of the “national roaming nationalist” who has repeatedly paid tribute to this article.
Jose. Rizal was honored as the father of the Filipino nation by the world, but he is a very wonderful father of the nation. He has only a small amount of practical political experience. He has never directly led an organized national revolutionary movement like Sun Wen or Nehru. He has neither the charitable religious charisma nor the Jiang Yishui masses. Charming leader, not even George. Washington or another hero of the book, Jose, the father of Cuban independence. José Marti (1853-1895), the heroic commander who commanded the armed revolution. The most important thing he did in his short life was to write for a Philippine nation that had not yet appeared—mainly a novel, and then imagined the appearance of the Filipino nation through his novels, and summoned the latecomers. Set out to construct the political actions of the nation.
In the book ""Times of Globalization"", Anderson reminds us that Rizal's narrative of national novels has never been just a narrow narrative of localism, but from the homeland, from the world to imagine homeland, summoning the motherland in the world, bringing the world into the world. The motherland continues to use the global narrative of cross-referencing, comparison, association, and replacement between the Philippines and the world. For this reason, Rizal's novel perfectly reflects the cosmopolitan roots of modern Asian and non-nationalism: nationalism is actually a way of watching the world.
We can understand the two pieces of political novels that Li Shu has completed in succession as his ""imagination"" and ""call"" to the nation.
The first ""Noli me Tangere"" (1887, Latin originally meant ""Don't touch me"") is Rizal's imagination of the Philippines and the Filipino nation. In the novel, he portrays a colonial bureaucracy, fallen clerics, local co-workers, emerging indigenous bourgeoisie, rebellious intellectuals to adolescent girls, peasants, grave thieves, bandits, and laborers in a fictional and slightly mocking brushwork. Etc., including complex images of all walks of life, all classes, ethnic groups, ages and genders, and this image constitutes a social whole that he calls ""Philippines.""
In other words, Rizal has ""imagined"" the face of the Philippine nation with a wonderful flower. Anderson pointed out that Rizal was the first local author to present the entire image of the Filipino nation through the narrative of modern fiction, so it was the ""first Filipino"". In fact, this amazing language act of narrating the nation also made him the first and most creative anti-colonial nationalist in modern East Asia.
In the second part of the book ""El Filibusterismo"" (1891), Rizal countered the first realism style, and he took the action of the student demonstrations and anarchists he experienced or witnessed during his long stay in Europe. Propaganda by deed, such as the terrorist assassination, and the scenes that were unimaginable in the Philippines at that time were moved into and replaced by this colonial society. In addition, he also heavily hinted at the global geopolitical conflicts of the 1890s in this work. Borrowing Anderson’s vivid language, Rizal “imagined the political disintegration of the Philippine society depicted in the first work and the ruin of the entire ruling elite” in the Uprising, and this It is an unprecedented imagination - the Filipinos never thought about the disintegration of the colonial order and the possibility of ruling the group, but Rizal's novels boldly, vividly, and fiercely reminded of this possibility.
As Anderson said, the imaginary national revolution of Rizal has had great consequences in reality. ""As if this genius elf has escaped from the bottle,"" the rebellious heroes who fought in the novel began to gain their own lives. . This is the function of the Insurgent: it summons the actor. Inspired and inspired by the novels of Lich, it was finally launched in 1896, leading the armed revolution, and two years later, the national hero of Spanish colonial rule, Andres Bonifacio (1863- - 1897, also one of the heroes of this book), isn't it the embodiment of the ""insurgent"" by Li Bra? Here, the novel and the novelist parted ways: the novelist Rizal did not support the armed struggle, but the armed struggle he imagined in the novel encouraged, summoned, and induced the ultimate resistance and breakup action in reality.

Like many popular serial novels of the 19th century, the story of our ""Globalization Age"" is also ""to be continued"" because it ends in the new empire and re-colonization, not the independence of the colony of the Philippines. However, this book is bound to be unfinished, because it tells the story of the weak and small people in the empire, but the unfinished and unfinished is the geopolitical fate of the weak nationalism in the empire.
However, this wonderful text completely and vividly depicts a prototype of anti-colonial nationalism that emerged in the early days of globalization—born by globalization (imperialism and colonialism) and thus deeply shaped by globalization. An open, highly aware contemporary world, attaches great importance to nationalism that is interconnected and has a strong internationalist spirit. This image completely subverts the portrayal and accusation of the closed character of nationalism in the popular discourse, because it captures the era of globalization, how the colonial side uses dialectical use of the global path created by the empire to resist. So we know that the scenery that Anderson saw on the top of Olympus is a double structure: it shows the strict restrictions of geopolitics on the weak (such as the empire), but also suggests the way out of the weak (reverse Use the global network created by the Empire for international links and counterattacks).
The era in which we live is more than a hundred years old, and it can be said to be an era of ""late globalization."" In the era of late globalization, although the empire no longer has legitimacy, the failure of neoliberalism to control unbalanced global capital expansion and global governance has induced a new wave of empire. For the geopolitical weak, late globalization is a highly uncertain and dangerous era, because the structure of the empire is not moving, and the fate of the new and old sovereigns and re-colonization is constant. However, Anderson's dialectic of the empire and the colony in the Age of Globalization, the dual structure of restraint and escape, oppression and freedom we saw on the top of Olympus, is also clearer and clearer in this era. .
As Rodrik said, late globalization is an era of ""hyper-globalization"". Capital without global governance constraints expands and ravages everywhere, and it triggers fierce geopolitical conflicts and tightens the world. The ground is combined in a common disaster. However, the other side of this hellish scene is the promise of liberation and freedom: extreme globalization also means that the empire is more restricted, it is not easy to take one-sided action, and the internationalization of the weaker is deeper, the international knowledge is richer, international The stronger the link. Under the condition that the empire's legitimacy declines, this means that today's weak people are more likely to resist and escape.
This is the story of the two islands in East Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are now taking place. In the era of late globalization, we have to continue to bear the fate of the alternate and continuous colonization of the sovereign state, but we have absorbed a lot of knowledge about the world because of extreme global integration, made numerous transnational friends, and also established a huge international Linked networks - Today we are far more international than Rizal more than a century ago. In the era of late globalization, every Taiwanese and every Hong Kong person is a Rizal that roams the world. If a Rizal opens up the road to imagining the nation, what can millions of tens of millions of Rizal achieve? The empire is strong and fragile because the empire is trapped on the mainland, but the island has the world. Dialectics of being trapped and free - this is Benadic. Anderson's seemingly intractable ""Times of Globalization"" gives us inspiration.

I would like to pay tribute to all the Hong Kong people who are fighting in the water revolution, the Hong Kong people of the world, and all the Taiwanese who have dedicated themselves to defending Taiwan's democratic independence.

The gap between the rich and the poor, class deprivation, political disorder... At the end of the 19th century, like today, ""globalization"" brings greater inequality. So, for the first time in human history, the rebels have also linked each other and let the resistance movement ""globalize""!

The most historical and comparative political study of the ""Imagined Community"" author Benadic. Anderson wrote for the 21st century!
This book is a monograph by Anderson in the early 21st century on international political studies in the late nineteenth century. At the end of the nineteenth century, three Filipinos, the novelist Rizal, the folklorist Lu Leizhen, and the revolutionary son of Pengxi, who lived in Japan, took the lead. As they lived through their lives, they looked at the international situation and the colonial revolution.
In Anderson's research, the world of the nineteenth century has been connected into a large network through telegraph, ship travel and other technologies. Compared to today, it can be called ""early globalization."" In this era of early globalization, there are various problems as they are today: the gap between rich and poor, class deprivation, political centralization, democratic movements, violent suppression, resources concentrated in big countries, and local interests have been squeezed for a long time... The arrival of the era of ""globalization"" has caused greater inequality. But it also gives the colonial people the opportunity to use the global network for revolution. For the first time in history, the rebels around the world are connected to each other to make the resistance movement ""global.""
Benadic. Anderson used the montage technique to follow the three protagonists' journey to the international world, depicting three overlapping worlds in the nineteenth century: the first world was the international world system between the 1860s and the 1990s, and it was mastered by powerful leaders such as Bismarck. Hands. The second world is a global leftist, international anarchist world, in which the active revolutionary movements from countries and across borders are active. The third world is the lingering Spanish Empire, and its two colonies: Cuba and the Philippines. In these overlapping worlds, three extraordinary Filipino figures have emerged - the novelist Rizal, the folklorist Lu Leizhen, and the revolutionary revolutionary Peng Si. With his life experience as the axis, Anderson launched a magnificent picture of the world at the end of the 19th century.
In this book, the reader will meet a variety of characters with the journey of the three protagonists, such as Sun Yat-sen of China, Liang Qichao, the end of Japan, and the Marty of Cuba, among them. These revolutionary elements from all over the world met on the global stage built by the imperialist order and jointly wrote a story about rebelling against colonization and fighting for sovereignty.
