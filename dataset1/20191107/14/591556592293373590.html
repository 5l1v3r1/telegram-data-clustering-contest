      <p>If you're in the market for a tablet that's repairable, then Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview">Surface Pro X</a> should be on your shortlist. Why? Because according to repair specialists at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+X+Teardown/127703">iFixit</a>, Microsoft has upped its repairability game dramatically.<br/><br/>According to iFixit, "the Surface Pro X is one of the more repairable tablets we've seen lately," which is high praise from a company that spends a lot of time tearing down and analyzing the repairability of devices.<br/><br/><b>CNET: </b><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-sleek-but-software-hasnt-caught-up-yet/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Microsoft Surface Pro X review: Sleek, but software hasn't caught up yet</b></a><br/><br/>But there's more. Compared to Apple's tablet offering, the Surface Pro X is "far more repairable than any iPad in the past nine years."<br/><br/>So, what makes the Surface Pro X so repairable? A combination of things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A super easy to replace SSD (all it needs is a SIM eject pin and a T3 driver -- there's no need to remove the screen to do this).</li>
        <li>The display is held down with foam adhesive that doesn't require heat or solvents to remove, which is a first for tablets according to iFixit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But the design could be made even more friendly. The battery is still glued down in place and requires a lot of disassembly to reach, and there are a number of delicate ribbon cables that can be torn or broken.<br/><br/>But it's still progress, and a sign that Microsoft is taking repairability into account when designing its devices.</p>
