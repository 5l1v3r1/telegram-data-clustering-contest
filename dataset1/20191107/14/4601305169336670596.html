      <p>Police in a Phoenix, Arizona suburb received a 911 emergency call recently from a 5-year-old boy who just wanted to order a Happy Meal from McDonald’s, and who, other than this, didn't have an actual emergency.</p>
      <p>The City of Mesa Police Department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MesaAzPD/photos/a.197458856934406/2946832598663671/?type=3">published the call audio on their Facebook page</a>.</p>
      <p>In the recording, Charlie Skabelund, who is five, asks if he's speaking with McDonald's.</p>
      <p>“Do you have an emergency?” dispatcher Anthony Bonilla replies.</p>
      <p>There's a pause.</p>
      <p>Then, the kindergartener says he would like “One Mc-Happy Meal.”</p>
      <p>The child then hangs up the phone.</p>
      <p>Fifteen minutes later, Mesa police officer Randolph “Scott” Valdez arrived at the Skabelund’s driveway to deliver the Happy Meal in person to Charlie.</p>

      <p>Officer Valdez also spoke to the child about how 911 is to be used properly.</p>
      <p>The boy's dad, Randy Skabelund, spoke to the dispatcher in a follow-up call later to apologize and explain that there was not an emergency, but that little Charlie probably got a hold of dad's cellphone.</p>
      <p>Kim Skabelund, Charlie's mom, says officer Valdez handled the situation with “love and kindness.”</p>
