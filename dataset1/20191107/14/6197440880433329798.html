      <h1>Valve may be developing ‘Steam Cloud Gaming’ as a Google Stadia competitor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:40:34+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-launching/">launches in just a couple of weeks</a> and the service is set to be the first of a few game streaming options. Now, some unearthed code is suggesting that Steam is working on its own game streaming service to compete with Stadia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1192017645765382144"><i>@SteamDB</i> spotted</a> code from a partner site which mentions that Valve – the company that owns Steam – is working on something called “Steam Cloud Gaming.”</p>
      <p>The implications of that name are pretty obvious, but there’s a lot we don’t know about what Valve is working on. Partners will need to sign an addendum to their terms alongside this new service.</p>
      <p>This discovery raises a few questions, firstly whether or not Valve could even pull off this technology. A huge part of the reason that Google Stadia can pull off low-latency game streaming is by using Google’s vast network of servers located across the world, and that’s something a game streaming service from Steam wouldn’t have access too.</p>
      <p>Right now, it’s important to take this with a huge grain of salt, but with Google and Microsoft pushing game streaming forward, it makes sense that a big name such as Valve would want to get in on the fun. No official word has been given from the company.</p>
