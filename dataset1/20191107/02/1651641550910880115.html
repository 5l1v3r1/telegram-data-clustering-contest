      <p>Back in August, we <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-makes-changes-to-the-new-tab-context-menu-in-the-latest-canary-update/">reported</a> that Google had dropped some items from the tab context menu. The options included New tab, Close other tabs, Reopen closed window and Bookmark all tabs.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Google <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-gives-in-to-pressure-again-and-brings-back-google-chrome-close-other-tab-option/">confirmed</a> that they will bring back the Close other tabs option as the option is still being used. However, the company won’t be adding back the other removed options. That being said, Google will soon allow third-party developers to create extensions that can add back options. A <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1894630">new commit</a> (<i>via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/dsnaxf/do_you_miss_some_of_the_items_in_the_tab_context">Reddit</a></i>) on the Chromium Gerrit repository confirmed that Google is planning to allow extensions to add options using “chrome.contextMenus API”.</p>
      <p>There’s no ETA mentioned at the moment but we expect Google to enable the feature soon. Once done, Google Chrome users will be able to take advantage of the API change to add back options using third-party extensions.</p>
