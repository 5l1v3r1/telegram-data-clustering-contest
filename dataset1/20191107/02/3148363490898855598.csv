WKBW reports that 36-year-old Charles Cooper allegedly “forced his way into a home” around 9 p.m. on Tuesday night. The 76-year-old homeowner claimed Cooper pointed a gun in his face while making his entry.
Cooper was wearing a ski mask, reports say.
Cooper allegedly ordered the homeowner and his wife to the back of the home. The homeowner went first because he had a shotgun he believed he could retrieve once he got back there.
The homeowner said, “I hurried up and went down, he didn’t follow me right away. I backed up against the wall, reached up and got the shotgun. I put it behind me. He couldn’t see it. He turned around, dropped his money and he reached down and I shot from the hip. He went down.”
13 WHAM reports that Cooper was airlifted to a hospital and charges against him are pending upon his release.
