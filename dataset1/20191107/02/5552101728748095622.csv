【對不起牛肉麵番外篇】小二喪母　打工賺贏老師雙倍薪　
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by 王筱君, 陳俊銘, 何懿原
「其實我母親如果沒走的話，我可能不用這麼辛苦做這個。」宜蘭頭城排隊名店龍記尚品牛肉麵創始人陳學良小學二年級母親癌逝，父親擺攤賣冰，他和姊姊從小就要張羅一家人的三餐，練就一身好廚藝。沒有傘的孩子才會努力奔跑，陳學良高中寒暑假，清晨4點就到便當店包便當，再扛上火車月台兜售，1個月可賺7、8千元零用錢，是當年老師的雙倍月薪，做事有方法的他很早就展露生意頭腦。



「我記得小時候，我爸都是用籠子下面鋪木屑，裝一整籠斑節蝦拿到醫院送醫師，媽媽開2次刀，第二次送到台大醫院，癌細胞已經蔓延，無法處理只能縫回去。」「送台大那次要花5萬元，民國50幾年可以買下頭城火車站前連7間透天厝含土地，那時奶奶只說『人在錢再賺就有』，沒想到人沒醫好錢也沒了。」提起童年往事，陳學良不願刻意賣弄悲情，更沒有一絲一毫怨天尤人情緒。

小學二年級喪母，父親忙著擺攤做生意，陳學良坦言：「從小到大我都沒人管，想學好就學好、想學壞就學壞，但我覺得學壞沒前途，連試都不會想試。」高中暑假他就到便當店打工，清晨4點就要到店裡幫忙裝便當，扛上火車站月台兜售，1個便當可賺1元，1天最多可賣300個。
賣便當是2人一組，1人顧前、1人顧後節車廂，但陳學良卻從中間開始賣，「中段車廂常常被忽略，那時我就小聰明，加上動作特別快，賣完之後還有時間再往前或後面跑。」70年代老師一個月薪水才3千多元，陳學良打工1個月就可以賺7、8千元，他豪氣地說：「自己賺錢自己花很爽呀！那年代有錢就是大哥，下課就跑福利社請同學吃東西，大家都很買我的帳。」

在同儕間，陳學良永遠是意見領袖、孩子王，「以前有愛心募款，我們班的募款金額總是特別高，我當班長，我第一個先捐50元，然後身邊的死黨也都挺我，訓導主任都私下打聽我有沒有脅迫同學，學校記我嘉獎我都不敢貼布告欄，大家的功勞卻記在我頭上。」
經營龍記尚品牛肉麵之前，陳學良曾開卡拉ok店，工作輕鬆又好賺，每天睡到下午自然醒，傍晚到店裡簡單打掃、切水果，1瓶啤酒成本18元賣60元，還可賺1成小費，1個晚上少則1萬元、多則3、4萬元營業額，榮景維持長達4年。
「唯一比較討厭的是，有些噗嚨共（指迷糊少根筋）喝了酒會打架鬧事，比較有分寸的會到店外打，但也把鄰居嚇得半死，一看不對勁立刻先把掃把畚箕藏好，怕不小心變凶器。」陳學良哭笑不得的說。因店裡常有人酒後鬧事，久而久之一般消費者敬而遠之，加上常要讓熟客賒帳，曾有從小看著陳學良長大的鄰居長輩問：「你又不是老大，你開這個要幹嘛？」讓他決定把卡拉ok店頂出去。

[I'm sorry for the beef noodles outside the article] Xiao Er lost the mother to work to earn the teacher double pay
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Wang Yijun, Chen Junming, He Yuyuan
""In fact, if my mother didn't leave, I might not have to work so hard."" Yilantou City lined up the famous store Longji Shangpin beef noodle founder Chen Xueliang primary school second-grade mother died, his father stalled selling ice, he and he grew up To build a family of three meals, practice a good cooking. Children without umbrellas will work hard. Chen Xueliang is in high school, winter and summer vacation. At 4 o'clock in the morning, he will go to the shop and shop for lunch. Then he will sell on the train platform. You can earn 7 or 8 thousand yuan in pocket money in one month. He has a monthly salary, and he has a business approach.



""I remember when I was a child, my dad used the cage to lay sawdust underneath the cage. He took a whole cage of shrimp and took it to the hospital for a doctor. The mother opened the knife twice, and the second time it was sent to the National Taiwan University Hospital. The cancer cells have spread and cannot be processed. I can sew it back."" ""It would cost 50,000 yuan to send the University of Taiwan. In the 50 years of the Republic of China, you can buy 7 land-permeable land in front of the train station in Lower City. At that time, Grandma only said that people will earn money when they earn money. ""I didn't expect people to have no money to heal."" When he mentioned his childhood, Chen Xueliang did not want to show off his sadness, and there was no trace of grievances.

In the second grade of elementary school, she lost her mother and her father was busy setting up a business. Chen Xueliang said frankly: ""I have no one to control from small to large. If I want to learn well, I will learn well. If I want to learn bad, I will learn badly. But I don’t think there is any future for learning. I want to try."" In the summer of high school, he went to the bento shop to work. At 4 o'clock in the morning, he will go to the store to help with the lunch. He will sell it on the platform of the train station. One lunch can earn 1 yuan, and up to 300 can be sold in one day.
Selling lunch is a group of 2 people, 1 person in front and 1 person in the car, but Chen Xueliang sells from the middle. ""The middle car is often ignored. At that time, I was smart, and the action was very fast. After the sale, I sold it. There is still time to run forward or backward."" In the 70s, the monthly salary of the teacher was only 3,000 yuan. Chen Xueliang earned 7,000 yuan in one month. He said with pride: ""It’s cool to make money yourself. In those days, it was the big brother who had money. When I was in class, I ran the welfare agency and asked my classmates to eat. Everyone bought my account.""

In the same period, Chen Xueliang is always the opinion leader and the child king. ""There was a love fundraising in the past. The fundraising amount of our class is always very high. I am the squad leader. I will donate 50 yuan first, then the buddies around me. It’s quite me, the director of the training has privately inquired if I have coerced my classmates. I don’t dare to post a bulletin on the school’s award. Everyone’s credit is on my head.”
Before running Longji Shangpin Beef Noodle, Chen Xueliang once opened a karaoke shop, working easily and earning money. Every day, I slept in the afternoon and naturally woke up. In the evening, I went to the store to clean and cut the fruit. The cost of a bottle of beer was 18 yuan and 60 yuan. Earn a tip of 10%, a minimum of 10,000 yuan in one night, and a turnover of 30,000 yuan and 40,000 yuan. Rongjing will last for 4 years.
""The only thing that is more annoying is that some people who share a drink will fight and make trouble. They will go to the store outside the store, but they will scare their neighbors to death. If they don't feel right, they will immediately put the broom."" Hidden, afraid to accidentally change the weapon."" Chen Xueliang said with a smile. Because there are people in the store who often make trouble after drinking, the average consumer stays away from it for a long time, and often has to let the regular customers credit, and the neighbors who grew up watching Chen Xueliang asked: ""You are not the boss, what are you doing this?"" Let him decide to put the karaoke shop out.
