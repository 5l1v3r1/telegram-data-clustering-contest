【對不起牛肉麵3】日操15小時　排隊客潮激出心臟病

這次再度失業，陳學良不願走回頭路賣冰，又不想看人臉色當上班族，剛好有朋友在台北、宜蘭賣牛肉麵，願傳授技術，「台北的是用電話口頭教，宜蘭的我去學了一個早上，回來就自己摸索。」1989年牛肉麵店開張，但生意普通，閒暇時他還玩股票，「那時還沒結婚，一人飽全家飽，很輕鬆沒什麼壓力。」

怎料80年代末期遇台股泡沫化，他慘虧百萬元，「所有錢都賠光了，乾脆收心好好做生意。」原是不婚族的他，在卡拉OK店結識陪同事來唱歌的潘美玲，2人差10歲，陳學良堅稱：「我沒有追，只送自己煮的便當，聽說是便當裡的小卷夠大尾，讓她很滿意。」
廚藝了得的他，曾到女友家辦2桌筵席菜，讓準岳父、岳母刮目相看，婚後太太辭去工作，夫妻倆披星戴月守著小吃店。而陳學良也一頭栽進牛肉麵的世界，逛書店必買教煮牛肉麵的食譜書籍，週日放假時更是揪全家人吃遍全台牛肉麵名店。
有時刁嘴客人也是良師，他不諱言：「客人一直嫌，我一直改進，慢慢批評聲越來越少，我就知道自己已經抓到黃金比例。」2006年雪隧通車，為宜蘭頭城帶來大批觀光人潮，也讓龍記牛肉麵生意強強滾。
「1碗麵煮1分鐘算快吧？但問題一開店就湧進50、60人，等於要花1小時才能消化完，換句話說，下一批客人吃到麵時，可能已經等超過1小時，客人等這麼久，自然對我們的品質要求會更高一點。」獨撐內場的陳學良，只要從門縫看到排隊人潮，心臟就會怦怦怦加速狂跳。











表面上，龍記尚品牛肉麵看似只營業3小時，但每天開店前6小時陳學良就開始備料，打烊後更是一路做到晚上10點、11點，日操15至16小時，疲勞與壓力日積月累，50歲那年他突然胸悶喘不過氣，疑似心肌梗塞被送上119救護車。陳學良苦笑說：「一輩子沒住過院，第一次就被直送加護病房，醫生叫我老婆簽病危通知書時，她的手皮皮挫，差點簽不下去。」那年大兒子才國二，老二還在念小學，簡直把全家人嚇壞了。

[Sorry beef noodles 3] 15 hours a day, queuing crowds to excite heart disease
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Wang Yijun, Chen Junming, He Yuyuan
This time I was unemployed again, Chen Xueliang did not want to go back and sell ice, but did not want to look at the face of the office workers. Just had friends selling beef noodles in Taipei and Yilan. I would like to teach technology. ""Taipei is speaking by phone, I am going to study in Yilan. In the morning, when I came back, I groped myself."" In 1989, the beef noodle shop opened, but the business was normal. In his spare time, he also played stocks. ""At that time, I was not married. One person was full and full, and it was easy and stressful.""





His wife, Pan Meiling, went to the karaoke store opened by Chen Xueliang and became acquainted with each other. (courtesy of Chen Xueliang)

How do you expect the Taiwan stocks to be in a bubble in the late 1980s? He lost a million yuan. ""All the money is lost. I just want to do business well."" He was originally a non-married person, and he met with colleagues at the karaoke shop. Pan Meiling singing, 2 people are 10 years old, Chen Xueliang insisted: ""I did not chase, only sent my own cooked lunch, I heard that the small volume in the lunch is big enough to make her very satisfied.""
After cooking, he went to his girlfriend's house to do 2 tables of banquet dishes, so that the prospective father-in-law and mother-in-law looked at each other. The married wife resigned from work, and the couple wore stars and watched the snack bar. Chen Xueliang also plunged into the world of beef noodles. The bookstore must buy recipe books for cooking beef noodles. On Sundays, the whole family ate the whole beef noodle shop.
Sometimes the pouting guest is also a good teacher. He does not swear: ""The guests have always been sceptical. I have been improving. I am slowly criticizing and getting less and less. I know that I have already caught the golden ratio."" In 2006, the snow tunnel was opened to Yilan. The first city brought a large number of tourists, and the Longji beef noodle business was strong.
""1 bowl of noodles for 1 minute is fast? But the problem is that if you open a shop, you will have 50 or 60 people. It will take an hour to digest. In other words, the next batch of guests may have waited more than 1 when they eat. Hours, guests wait for so long, naturally, our quality requirements will be higher."" Chen Xueliang, who is alone in the infield, as long as they see the queues from the door, the heart will speed up and jump.











On the surface, Longji Shangpin beef noodles seems to be only open for 3 hours, but Chen Xueliang begins to prepare materials 6 hours before the opening of the store every day. After the war, it is all the way to 10:00, 11:00, 15 to 16 hours, fatigue and stress. Over time, at the age of 50, he suddenly had chest tightness and breathlessness. He suspected that the myocardial infarction was sent to the 119 ambulance. Chen Xueliang said with a smile: ""I have never lived in the hospital for the rest of my life. I was sent directly to the intensive care unit for the first time. When the doctor asked my wife to sign the notice of critical illness, her hand skin was frustrated and almost could not be signed."" The second child is still in elementary school and scared the whole family.
