      <p>TORONTO - A family from Everton, Ont., northeast of Guelph, fears that a popular brand of children’s shoes, that light up as you walk in them, may have caused a fire in their house.</p>
      <p>Abby Spielmacher said a fire in her home this past Sunday morning could have been tragic as she was hosting a children’s birthday party for her daughter at the time. </p>
      <p>“One of the girls screamed out ‘fire, fire.’ I went to the mudroom where the shoes and backpacks were and saw three-foot flames," Spielmacher said. </p>
      <p>She and her husband tried to smother the flames and threw the burning items outside. A pair of battery-powered light up shoes was in a backpack hanging on the wall and the family believes that one of the battery-operated light-up shoes caused the fire.</p>

      <p>“It didn't come from the wall or the floor. When we looked through all the burnt items the only thing we could think of was the shoe," Spielmacher said. </p>
      <p>Her five-year-old son Bryson said the S-Sport shoes from Skechers were one of his favourite pairs. </p>
      <p>“When you step on them, they light up,” he said. </p>
      <p>While the family believes the shoes are the likely source of the fire, they said they can't be sure without an investigation. </p>
      <p>In May of 2016, a family in Texas said they believed light-up shoes caused a fire in their SUV. </p>
      <p>Class action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. alleging battery-operated shoes are responsible for fires and burns to children's feet. The lawsuits allege when the shoes get wet, the batteries can short circuit and cause a fire. </p>
      <p>“We have absolutely no evidence or reason to believe that this style caused a fire, which is pure speculation at this time. Nonetheless, we will contact the owner of the shoes so that they can be returned and examined,” a Skechers spokesperson told CTV News Toronto.</p>
      <p>The family wants to have the shoes investigated to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. </p>
      <p>“Thank goodness it didn't happen during the night. We were fortunate to find the fire within minutes," Spielmacher said.</p>
