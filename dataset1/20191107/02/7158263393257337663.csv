Who Is the Butterfly on ‘The Masked Singer’ Season 2?

07 Nov 2019, 02:30

Okay, you’re here, so it’s pretty safe to assume you’ve fallen victim to watching The Masked Singer. Don’t worry, it’s okay—I can totally understand why! After working your very stressful 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift, the last thing you wanna do is watch television that will stress you out! And just like that, in comes The Masked Singer, perhaps the most delightfully preposterous competition show to hit television in recent years. The show has blessed us with celebs cosplaying as food, inanimate objects, actual animals...literally anything and everything.
Now, season 2 of The Masked Singer is BACK and better than ever, baby! And with that comes all the bets and predictions on who’s who behind the masks. People have been solidifying their guesses for the Flamingo (Adrienne Bailon, maybe) and the Fox (Jeremy Renner, is that you?), so it’s only natural that theories are coming in about the majestic, glittering Butterfly...who may or may not be Michelle Williams of Destiny’s Child. I was skeptical at first, but the evidence really adds up. Let’s discuss!



The telling clues
In the Butterfly’s identity teaser, it said, “After achieving success in many stages of life, I found myself terrified by the one place I used to call home.” First of all, awww. Second of all, this totally sounds like Michelle.



The “many stages of life” could very well reference all the years she spent performing onstage with Destiny’s Child before they officially called it quits in 2005!
And when the Butterfly later said it was “terrified by the one place I used to call home,” a picture of London flashed in the clip. This could possibly be referring to when Michelle was living in London while she performed as Roxie Hart in the play Chicago.
Perhaps the most telling clue is when the Butterfly said, “I’m here to take you to church. Can I get an amen?” Michelle is known for her love of gospel, so much so that she released three solo gospel albums.
This ICONIC performance of “Bang Bang”
Literally from the moment the Butterfly opened its mouth to sing, I had a sneaking suspicion it was totally Michelle. Someone with this much agility in their voice MUST be an industry veteran, which Michelle totally is. Being one of three members of Destiny’s Child means you must have talent and skill, amirite?



People in the comments definitely agree and are thoroughly convinced that only Michelle could sound like this. I mean:
“Michelle from Destiny’s Child is killing the game right about now!”
“This is Michelle Williams and y’all are going to put some respect on her name.”
“On the notion that we all know it’s Michelle Williams, how did a voice like THIS get so much hate when in DC?!”
“C’mon, we all know this is Michelle Williams. She sick of being just the third member of Destiny’s Child and not even the most famous Michelle Williams.”
“Michelle is HERE! She like, ‘Beyoncé ain’t the only one that can SLAY!’ All three Destiny’s Child women...AMAZING! Michelle is doing her thing...AND the band arrangement is SICK!”
This video showcasing Michelle’s high notes
One fan of Michelle’s was crafty enough to find a video of Michelle singing and SLAYING some high notes in a live performance. The fan then put The Masked Singer performance of “Bang Bang” directly after, and the similarities are striking, to say the least. Michelle and the Butterfly even do the same hand and arm movements when performing! A coincidence? I think not.



That being said, the internet unanimously agrees that Michelle is the Butterfly, and there are tons of tweets to prove it!















Okay and on top of all THAT, the Butterfly had a car salesman reference in her clues—and a rudimentary Google search of “Michelle Williams” + “car salesman” brings up the fact that her dad did, in fact, sell cars when she was growing up. I mean...c’mon! Michelle Williams of Destiny’s Child is definitely the Butterfly, and if you think otherwise, your ears need cleaning!
