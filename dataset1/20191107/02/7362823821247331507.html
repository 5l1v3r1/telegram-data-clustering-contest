      <h1>LA Times accused of 'blaming' Mexican cartel massacre victims by noting family's 'long history of violence'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T02:54:13+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>The Los Angeles Times faced fierce backlash for its coverage of the nine Americans murdered by a Mexican drug cartel this week, after a report highlighted the family's "long history of violence."</p>
      <p>At least six children and three women living in a faith-based community of U.S. citizens in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> were shot to death Monday in the northern part of the country, and six more children were wounded after their convoy came under fire during a brazen daylight ambush believed to have been carried out by gunmen affiliated with cartels.</p>
      <p>All the victims are believed to be members of the extended LeBaron family, who have lived in a religious community in La Mora, northern Mexico, a decades-old settlement in Sonora state founded as part of an offshoot of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/mormon">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> around 70 miles south of Douglas, Ariz.</p>

      <p>However, the California newspaper ran <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-11-06/mormons-mexico-lebaron-fundamentalist-history">a report</a> on Monday headlined, "U.S. victims in Mexico massacre were tied to family with a long history of violence," which detailed the community's tragic past with the cartels.</p>

      <p>The report sparked a firestorm of criticism on social media.</p>
      <p>"Is the idea here that the victims had it coming? This is an insane piece," conservative commentator Ben Shapiro <a href="https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1192127080625885184">reacted.</a></p>
      <p>"This story is just terrible. A family is burying small children and now the media is dredging up completely unrelated events, committed by distant relatives, that happened more than a generation ago. Nice," The Dispatch senior editor David French <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1192126422149685249">wrote.</a></p>

      <p>The Washington Examiner's Siraj Hashmi <a href="https://twitter.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1192212183062654982">equated</a> the Times's report on the family to reports that have dug up "old problematic tweets."</p>
      <p>"They did it. They basically dug up the old problematic tweets of the family that was brutally murdered by a drug cartel in northern Mexico this week," Hashmi wrote.</p>

      <p>As Townhall's Julio Rosas <a href="https://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1192150693676822528">pointed out</a>, the Times later changed the headline of its report to "Massacre of U.S. citizens aims spotlight at Mormon community with deep roots in Mexico."</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Times did not immediately respond to Fox News' question regarding the changed headline.</p>
