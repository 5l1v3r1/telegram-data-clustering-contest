【江湖一點訣】滷三寶不加一滴水　讓人一吃就回不去
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by 王筱君, 陳俊銘, 何懿原
西南氣流為宜蘭帶來豐沛水氣，瞬間豆大雨水打在身乒乒乓乓，疾風驟雨卻無阻食客前仆後繼趕赴龍記牛肉麵。即使是平日，上午10點一過，龍記尚品牛肉麵店門前數十張候位椅已一位難求，半掩電捲門縫飄出陣陣牛高湯香氣，所有食客幾乎都是衝著創辦人陳學良研發的三寶牛肉麵而來，這款開店半小時內必秒殺鎮店寶，憑什麼讓人一吃就回不去？



「說一句實在話，做吃的沒什麼要領，就是眉眉角角要特別注意，小細節不一樣，做出來的東西就不一樣。」陳學良花31年磨一味，一頭栽進牛肉麵的世界，逛書店必買教煮牛肉麵的食譜書籍，週日放假時更是揪全家人吃遍全台牛肉麵名店，他謙稱煮牛肉麵的手藝是被客人「磨」出來的，「客人一直嫌，我一直改進，慢慢批評聲越來越少，我就知道自己已經抓到黃金比例。」


招牌牛三寶料多實在，整碗的料幾乎快滿出來。

本刊直擊他製作費工牛三寶冷凍包，澳洲牛肚得流水8小時去腥，翻面修剪粘膜與多餘油脂雜質，再加入新鮮檸檬川燙，滷牛肚過程中加入半罐豆腐乳，利用豆腐乳的酵素增添甘甜風味；牛肉則採較費工的生切做法，口感更勝熟切，為求均勻平整，每一塊牛肉都得磅重。
不論是滷牛肉、牛筋或牛肚，全程不加一滴水，以米酒取代，指著眼前這鍋牛筋，陳學良笑說：「如果是加水馬上現省100元，但味道完全不一樣。」用來提味的辛香料中藥材，陳學良幾乎每周到宜蘭市區百年中藥行老店選貨，每次採買金額超過1萬元，像是人蔘，一般料理店用1斤700、800元等級，他用到快2000元，甘草也是只買最大片的，中藥行老闆直呼：「他買東西很挑，只用最好的。」


陳學良（右）對食材相當挑剔，中藥行大盤商拿出最貴、最頂級藥材讓他挑，下重本不手軟。

妻子潘美玲爆料：「他到現在仍堅持早上親自上市場買菜，連蔥都要一根一根自己挑選，調味調色的醬油也選用非基改大廠牌，什麼都要最好、最漂亮的，價錢再貴他都買得下手。」陳學良聳聳肩說：「別人不是不會煮，只是捨不得花成本。」
招牌牛三寶冷凍包光食材重量就超過300克，供2人分食綽綽有餘，陳學良每天在廚房備料超過15小時，兒子曾估算食材、人力、時間成本，約占售價8成5，認為爸爸定價太佛心。


陳學良滷牛筋功力了得，厚逾2.5公分的牛筋軟Q充滿膠質，連老人家都咬得動。

對此，陳學良笑說：「以前開店就給這麼多，現在怎麼可能縮水？我們的食材用料成本高，客人都吃得出來，不要說物美真的是價廉，內行人一吃就跑不掉了、回不去了。」
手工製作冷凍包因產量有限，宅配訂單得等上2個月，但美味值得等待，不少在地人把龍記冷凍工坊當成地方伴手名物，寧可平日省吃儉用，也要買來送給親朋友好，無形中也幫陳學良做口碑行銷。
「全台灣牛肉麵一大堆，人家肯花錢來跟我買，錢先匯給你，還要耐心排隊等待，我當然要讓客人有驚豔的感覺。」儘管已是秒殺名店，每一天陳學良仍競競業業從早忙到晚，時時刻刻提醒自己莫忘初衷，要做就要做到最好。

[A little bit of rivers and lakes] The three treasures of the brine do not add a drop of water.
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Wang Yijun, Chen Junming, He Yuyuan
The southwesterly airstream brought abundant water and moisture to Yilan. In an instant, the big rainwater hit the table and ping-pong, and the hurricane and the rain stopped the diners and rushed to the Longji beef noodles. Even on weekdays, at 10:00 in the morning, dozens of waiting chairs in front of the Longji Shangpin beef noodle shop have been hard to find, and the half-covering of the door is full of aromas of beef soup. All the diners are almost always founded. The three treasures of beef developed by Chen Xueliang came from the store. This store will kill the town store treasure within half an hour. Why can't people go back if they eat?



""To tell the truth, there is no point in cooking. It is the eyebrows and corners to pay special attention to. The small details are different. The things that are made are different."" Chen Xueliang spent 31 years grinding and plunging into the world of beef noodles. Visiting the bookstore must buy recipe books for cooking beef noodles. On Sundays, the whole family ate the whole beef noodle shop. He said that the craft of boiled beef noodles was ""grinded out"" by the guests. ""The guests have always been suspected. I have been improving, and I have been slowly criticizing less and less, and I know that I have already caught the golden ratio.""


The signature Niu Sanbao is more realistic, and the whole bowl of material is almost full.

This magazine directly hits him to make a labored beef Sambo frozen package. The Australian beef belly has to flow for 8 hours to smash, turn over the mucosa and excess oil impurities, then add fresh lemon and hot, add half a can of bean curd in the process of braised beef belly, use The enzyme of bean curd adds a sweet flavor; the beef is more labor-intensive, and the taste is more ripe. In order to achieve evenness, each piece of beef is pounded.
No matter whether it is roast beef, beef tendon or tripe, do not add a drop of water in the whole process, replace it with rice wine, and point to the pot of beef in front of it. Chen Xueliang said with a smile: ""If you add water, you will save 100 yuan, but the taste is completely different."" The Chinese herbal medicine used to enhance the taste, Chen Xueliang almost every week to the old store in Yilan City, the century-old Chinese medicine store to choose the goods, each purchase amount of more than 10,000 yuan, like a person, the general restaurant with 1 kg 700,800 yuan grade He used 2,000 yuan faster, and licorice only bought the biggest one. The owner of the Chinese medicine bank said: ""He buys things very pick, only the best.""


Chen Xueliang (right) is quite picky about the ingredients. The Chinese medicine bank's large-cap stocks come up with the most expensive and top-grade medicinal materials to pick him up.

His wife, Pan Meiling, broke the news: ""He still insists on going to the market to buy food in the morning. Even the onions should be picked one by one. The soy sauce for seasoning and coloring also uses the non-basic reform brand. Beautiful, the price is too expensive, he can buy it."" Chen Xueliang shrugged and said: ""Others will not cook, just reluctant to spend.""
The signature of Niu Sanbao's frozen packaged foods weighs more than 300 grams, which is more than enough for 2 people. Chen Xueliang prepares more than 15 hours a day in the kitchen. His son estimated the cost of ingredients, manpower and time, accounting for about 85% of the price. Taifo heart.


Chen Xueliang's braised beef tendon skill, and the soft tendon with a thickness of more than 2.5 cm is full of gelatin, and even the elderly are biting.

In this regard, Chen Xueliang said with a smile: ""There was so much to open the store before. How can it shrink now? The cost of our ingredients is high, and the guests can eat it. Don't say that the goods are really cheap, and the insiders will not run as soon as they eat. It’s gone, I can’t go back.”
Due to the limited production of hand-made frozen bags, the home delivery order has to wait for 2 months, but the delicious food is worth waiting for. Many local people regard the Longji frozen workshop as a local companion, preferring to eat and use it on a regular basis. Good friends and relatives, also help Chen Xueliang to do word-of-mouth marketing.
""There are a lot of beef noodles in Taiwan. People are willing to pay for it. I will send it to you first. I have to wait patiently in line. I certainly want to make the guests feel amazing."" Although it is already a killing shop, every day Chen Xueliang Still racing from the morning to the night, always reminding me not to forget the original intention, to do it is best.


The signature Niu Sanbao frozen package does not contain broth, and the weight of light food is more than 300 grams, which is more than enough for 2 people. (250 yuan / share)
