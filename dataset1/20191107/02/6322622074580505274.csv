油气股会继续走高吗？
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Ahmad Naqib Idris








（吉隆坡7日讯）石油与天然气公司股价昨日进一步走高，归功于本地活动回暖的乐观情绪。
然而，能否在短期内维持上升趋势仍有待观察。
大马交易所能源指数从今年初的820.36点，涨至昨日的1196.49点，涨幅为45%。
从今年初至今，上升股包括科恩马（KNM Holdings Bhd，升506.67%）、达洋企业（Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd，扬251.85%）、Petra Energy Bhd（涨245.68%）及Carimin石油（Carimin Petroleum Bhd，增228.4%）。
油气股与原油价格走势不一致，因布兰特原油期货从4月份的每桶约74美元，跌至下半年的每桶约60美元。截稿时，布兰特原油期货报每桶62.50美元（258.75令吉）。
另一方面，这些公司的股价受到积极的领先指标以及国家石油（Petronas）在下半年提高资本开销的提振。
大马大华继显分析员Kong Ho Meng指出，领先指标——自升式钻井平台数量——比今年初有所增加，表明上游活动有所改善。
他表示，大马和联合开发区的自升式钻机数量从今年2月的9台，增加到9月的16台。
“这16台最终达到国油在其《2019-21年活动展望》中提及的16至19台自升式钻井平台需求预测。”
他说：“国油特别表示，对钻机的高需求是因对现有活动的需求增加。因此，像达洋企业这样的公司正在引导异常强劲的第三季度。”
不过，他指出，油气股能否持续上升，取决于国油将于12月发布的《2020-2022年活动展望》。
他说：“否则，股票收益可能会下降，投资者应该会套利。”
艾芬黄氏资本研究分析员Tan Jianyuan在11月4日的报告中鼓励投资者趁行业升温套利，因为今年第四季和第一季是季节性疲软时期（受季候风影响）。
他表示，企业收益将成为本月的重点，而且维修和钻机业者可能因受益于高工作流量，而发布更强的第三季业绩。
分析员说：“我们认为，海上维修业者可能会在2019财年第3季实现强劲利润，包括Deleum Bhd、Carimin石油、达洋企业和Petra Energy等维修、建造、变更合约受益者。”
Tan表示，艾芬黄氏资本研究也喜欢那些拥有良好盈利可见度的公司，如戴乐集团（Dialog Group Bhd）、Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd、Velesto Energy Bhd、Bumi Armada Bhd及科艺集团（Kelington Group Bhd）。
他说：“但是，鉴于最近行业增长以及我们研究的部分股项接近其合理价值，我们建议在即将发布的第三季强劲业绩套利，因为第四季和第一季是季节性疲软时期（受季候风影响）。”
他还指出，国油在上半年的资本开销严重不足，总计160亿令吉，或占其承诺全年500亿令吉的32%。
国油今年维持500亿令吉资本开销，其中一半是供本地项目，Tan表示，这意味着国油在未来几个月颁发更多合约。
他说：“我们相信活动将保持强劲，国内上游资本开销也将增至150亿令吉，高于2018年的80亿令吉。”

Will oil and gas stocks continue to rise?
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Ahmad Naqib Idris








KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 7): Oil and gas company shares rose further yesterday, thanks to the optimism that local activity is picking up.
However, it remains to be seen whether it is possible to maintain an upward trend in the short term.
The Bursa Malaysia Energy Index rose from 820.36 points at the beginning of this year to 1,196.49 points yesterday, an increase of 45%.
Since the beginning of this year, rising stocks include KNM Holdings Bhd (506.67%), Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd (251.85%), Petra Energy Bhd (245.68%) and Carimin Petroleum Bhd (Carimin Petroleum Bhd). Increased by 228.4%).
Oil and gas stocks and oil prices are inconsistent, as Brent crude oil futures fell from about $74 a barrel in April to about $60 a barrel in the second half. At the time of writing, Brent crude futures were quoted at $62.50 a barrel (RM258.75).
On the other hand, the share prices of these companies were positively boosted by the leading indicators and the increase in capital spending by Petronas in the second half of the year.
According to Kong Ho Meng, an analyst at Da Ma Dahua, the leading indicator, the number of jack-up rigs, has increased from the beginning of the year, indicating an improvement in upstream activities.
He said that the number of jack-up rigs in Malaysia and the joint development zone increased from 9 in February this year to 16 in September.
“The 16 units ultimately meet the demand forecast for 16 to 19 jack-up rigs mentioned by Petronas in its “2019-21 Activity Outlook.”
He said: ""National Oil specifically stated that the high demand for drilling rigs is due to increased demand for existing activities. Therefore, companies like Dayang are leading an extremely strong third quarter.""
However, he pointed out that whether oil and gas stocks will continue to rise depends on the ""Vision Outlook for 2020-2022"" that Petronas will release in December.
He said: ""Otherwise, stock returns may fall and investors should arbitrage.""
In the November 4th report, Affin Huang's research analyst Tan Jianyuan encouraged investors to stagnate the industry because the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year were seasonally weak (affected by the monsoon).
He said that corporate earnings will be the focus of this month, and repair and rig operators may be able to release stronger third-quarter results by benefiting from high workflow.
Analysts said: ""We believe that offshore maintenance operators may achieve strong profits in the third quarter of FY 2019, including maintenance, construction, and contractual beneficiaries such as Deleum Bhd, Carimin Petroleum, Dayang and Petra Energy.""
Tan said that Affin Huang's Capital Research also likes companies with good profitability, such as Dialog Group Bhd, Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd and Kelington Group Bhd. .
He said: ""However, given the recent industry growth and some of the stocks we studied are close to their reasonable value, we recommend a strong performance arbitrage in the upcoming third quarter, as the fourth quarter and the first quarter are seasonally weak (accepted Monsoon impact).""
He also pointed out that the capital expenditure of Petronas in the first half of the year was seriously insufficient, totaling RM16 billion, or 32% of its commitment to RM50 billion for the whole year.
Petronas has maintained a capital expenditure of RM50 billion this year, half of which is for local projects, which Tan said means that Petrol will issue more contracts in the coming months.
He said: ""We believe that the activity will remain strong and the domestic upstream capital expenditure will increase to RM15 billion, which is higher than RM8 billion in 2018.""
