      <p>ROME (AP) — Italy has given steelmaker ArcelorMittal a few days to agree to a plan to keep operating a southern Italian plant.</p>
      <p>The French-Italian steelmaker this week balked at continuing to operate the Taranto steel plant when the Italian government removed immunity from prosecution in case of environmental damage.</p>
      <p>Premier Giuseppe Conte says he has rejected as “unacceptable” the steelmaker’s plan to cut 5,000 jobs. Political pressure was building Thursday on the center-left government to avoid cuts.</p>
      <p>Conte said late Wednesday, after meeting ArcelorMittal executives, that the government offered in the talks to restore the immunity. But he described the immunity shield as a “false problem,” saying ArcelorMittal wants to slash jobs and cut production annually to 4 million tons, to far below previously agreed upon levels.</p>
