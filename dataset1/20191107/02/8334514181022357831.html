      <p>Speaking at a conference, Airbnb co-founder and Chief Executive Brian Chesky said the company would make a “significant investment” in the new measures and that it would not have an impact on plans to go public next year.</p>
      <p>“We are making the most significant change to our platform to increase the amount of trust in our platform,” Chesky said at The New York Times DealBook Conference.</p>
      <p>San Francisco-based Airbnb has already banned “party houses” after the shooting incident last week, where five people were killed at a large Halloween gathering inside a rental home.</p>
      <p>Airbnb will now expand manual screening of high-risk reservations from Dec. 15 to identify suspicious reservations and start a verification process for all the listings on its platforms, the company said.</p>
      <p>It will also set up a hot line for neighbors of Airbnb properties with concerns, and offer a “guest guarantee” whereby customers can unhappy with a listing can rebook at another property or get a full refund.</p>
      <p>Chesky said Airbnb was profitable in 2017 and 2018, and that the company has more money in its coffers than the $3.2 billion that it had raised through fundraising.</p>
      <p>Airbnb is leaning toward going public through a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering, Reuters has reported.</p>
      <p>In an IPO, shares are sold by a company to raise money. In a direct listing, however, no new shares are sold, rather existing investors are given the opportunity to sell shares.</p>
      <p>Asked about how Airbnb was approaching going public through an IPO or a direct listing, Chesky said, “I certainly don’t have any news to make except to say that we also don’t need to raise new money.”</p>
