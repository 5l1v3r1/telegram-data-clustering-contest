Barcelona target publicly reveals attraction to Bayern Munich
07 Nov 2019, 02:51 by Nishant Narayanan
German wunderkind Kai Havertz is being scouted by Barcelona who looks to expand their squad with promising talents.
Havertz, in an extensive interview with Marca, admits to having an open mind when discussing his future.
“I think I’ve picked up enough international experience at Leverkusen. I know the rhythm of these international matches and I’m confident that I can go abroad at any moment and play at clubs outside of Germany.”
The promising youngster has been linked with FC Barcelona as well as other European teams like Liverpool and Bayern Munich.
Blaugrana has been tracking the German for four years, dating back to his playing days with Leverkusen’s youth team, and will continue to watch the prospect in this week’s Champions League match between Atletico Madrid and Bayern Leverkusen.
Barca’s heavily stocked midfield, with Frankie de Jong, Sergio Busquets, Arthur Melo, Arthuro Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Carles Alena, is currently struggling to keep up with the pace of their opponents as evident in their previous two encounters. The rotational midfield has witnessed the reduced playing time for Alena and Rakitic, along with La Masia graduate Riqui Puig who is pushing for the first team.
The Spanish giants know that Leverkusen will charge a lot of money for the in-demand player who is currently valued at €90 million euro, according to Transfermarkt. The club has its financial issues as they look to bring in €124 million euro by the end of June in order to balance the books.
Regardless of the monetary issues, the German international has shown his interest and has even spoken about his attacking style and how his presence will suit Barcelona,
Yes, because Barcelona has a lot of the ball, but there are lots of teams that do that these days, not only Barcelona. Real Madrid, for example, are a team that has a lot of possession, although they’ve been a bit less efficient than Barcelona in recent years.
The youngster also admitted having maestro Andres Iniesta as his biggest football idols, while also listing other players that have inspired him.
“There are many players that inspired me like Kaka, [Zinedine] Zidane, Ronaldinho… they’ve always been my idols. Between the Spanish players, my favourite is Andres Iniesta. He’s outstanding on the ball. Unique. I like him the most.”
Amidst the player’s transfer speculations, however, Havertz has displayed his appeal for Bayern Munich.
“They’re probably the biggest club in Germany and there are many players that were very successful at a young age that went there, there’s something clear: if you want to be a star in Germany, you can’t go wrong with Bayern.”
The youngster has called upon both domestic and international teams that interest him. Leverkusen knows the quality of the player they currently possess and will surely look to demand a hefty sum for the German prospect.
Is Havertz a good fit for an already stacked Barca midfield?
