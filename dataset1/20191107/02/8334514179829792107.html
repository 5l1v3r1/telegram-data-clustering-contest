      <p>Cleveland Indians catcher Roberto Perez was selected the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year on Wednesday as the glove supplier announced its defensive player awards.</p>
      <p>Perez, who is one of four first-time honorees on the all-defensive team, threw out an American League-best 40.8 percent of base steals (20 of 49) this season.</p>
      <p>Also claiming their first Wilson team honor are three other position players: St. Louis Cardinals second baseman Kolten Wong, Arizona Diamondbacks left fielder David Peralta and New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge.</p>
      <p>The Houston Astros, named Defensive Team of the Year, also received an award for the first time.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles Angels shortstop Andrelton Simmons won for the sixth time, Milwaukee Brewers center fielder Lorenzo Cain earned his fourth award and Diamondbacks/Astros pitcher Zack Greinke won for the third time.</p>
      <p>Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman and Oakland Athletics third baseman Matt Chapman each won for the second time. Chapman was the 2018 Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>Wilson began picking a top defensive player in 2012 and added the team award in 2014.</p>
