【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】英國倫敦一間劇院6日正演出亞瑟米勒（Arthur Miller）劇作「推銷員之死」，期間天花板突然局部崩落，導致演出中斷，造成一些人輕傷、1100人疏散。
事發在倫敦西區的皮卡迪利劇院（Piccadilly Theatre），警方晚間8時許接獲報案後抵達現場。天花板因局部水泥板掉落，「每個人都撤出劇院，有些人受到輕傷。」
英國「地鐵報」（Metro）報導，當時坐在劇院內的記者喬治（Martin George）說，「演出大約10分鐘後，我們聽到劇院發出輕微的滴答聲響，民眾開始四處張望，在想是發生什麼事，但演出仍持續進行。」
他說：「幾分鐘後，滴答聲響愈來愈頻繁，聽起來像是有水從天花板滴下來，一些人開始起身移動。最後，聲音大到大家都站起來開始離開。」
他說：「就在我們站起來時，有一大塊天花板掉落，寬度大概有3到4公尺，民眾開始放聲大叫，每個人起身往樓梯移動。」



事發時院內正在演出1949年劇作「推銷員之死」（Death of a Salesman），由美國演員維德爾皮爾斯（Wendell Pierce）飾演主角威利羅曼（Willy Loman）。
維德爾皮爾斯事後在劇場入口外安撫觀眾，他說：「我不是故意讓劇情有這樣的發展。感謝大家都安全地撤離。我們為此深感道歉，我們很慶幸沒有人重傷。」
維德爾皮爾斯以演出電視影集「火線重案組」（The Wire）和2014年電影「逐夢大道」（Selma）而聞名。
