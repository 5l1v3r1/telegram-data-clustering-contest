英国议会正式解散

07 Nov 2019, 02:54

【中国金融信息网】 英国本届议会当地时间6日凌晨正式解散，这标志着12月的英国大选选战已拉开帷幕。英国大选将于12月12日举行。按英国法律，议会在大选开始前25个工作日自动解散。根据历史传统，英国首相鲍里斯约翰逊仍将觐见女王伊丽莎白二世，提请解散议会并获女王同意。议会解散后，议会下院所有席位自动空缺，但包括首相在内的所有内阁大臣仍保留现职位直至新内阁组建完成。英国上次大选于2017年举行。英国近百年来并无在圣诞节所在的12月举行大选的先例，但约翰逊政府为尽快兑现“脱欧”承诺不得不破例。民调显示，英国执政党保守党支持率领先反对党工党与自由民主党。英国“脱欧”僵局已持续3年有余。舆论认为，此次大选将成为实际意义上的“第二次脱欧公投”，选民将在支持“脱欧”与支持 “留欧”的政党间做出选择。

British parliament officially dissolved

07 Nov 2019, 02:54

[China Financial Information Network] The British parliament officially dissolved on the morning of the 6th local time, which marked the beginning of the December election campaign in the UK. The British general election will be held on December 12. Under British law, the parliament is automatically dissolved 25 working days before the start of the general election. According to historical traditions, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will still glimpse Queen Elizabeth II, requesting the dissolution of the parliament and the consent of the queen. After the dissolution of the parliament, all seats in the lower house of parliament were automatically vacant, but all cabinet ministers, including the Prime Minister, retained their current positions until the new cabinet was formed. The last election in the UK was held in 2017. In the past 100 years, Britain has not set a precedent for the general election in December, but the Johnson Administration has to make an exception to fulfill the promise of ""Brexit"" as soon as possible. Polls show that the British ruling party's Conservative Party support rate is ahead of the opposition Labor Party and the Liberal Democrats. The British ""Brexit"" deadlock has been going on for more than three years. Public opinion believes that this election will become the ""second referendum on the Brexit"" in the actual sense, and voters will make choices between the parties that support ""Brexit"" and support ""Leaving Europe.""
