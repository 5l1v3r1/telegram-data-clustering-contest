Jessie Ware has returned with a brand-new single titled ‘Mirage (Don’t Stop)’.
The song is Ware’s first new offering since releasing the song ‘Overtime’ in 2018 and ‘Adore You’ earlier in February. According to a press release, ‘Mirage (Don’t Stop)’ is a “return to her roots with a more club-based sound”. The track previews Ware’s upcoming fourth studio album, the follow-up to 2017’s ‘Glasshouse’. Her new record is reportedly set to arrive sometime next year.
