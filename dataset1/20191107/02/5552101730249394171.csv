【對不起牛肉麵2】他放棄一晚賺上萬的店　只因父親給的噩夢
07 Nov 2019, 02:54 by 王筱君, 陳俊銘, 何懿原
賣牛肉麵是陳學良人生第3次創業，在這之前開過冰果室與卡拉OK店，有話直說、心事藏不住的他自嘲：「最難賺的做最久。」身為家中唯一的男孩，父親擺攤賣剉冰，他從小耳濡目染幫忙煮豆子配料，小學2年級母親罹癌病逝，他和姊姊得站上爐灶張羅一家人的三餐。

退伍後，因養賽鴿結識海山唱片董事長，被延攬做外務，看不慣同事們遲到早退還找人代打上班卡，上班躲在倉庫下象棋，他狀告高層，把所有同事一次得罪光，之後雖被另一家公司挖角，但有業務往來的前公司卻挑明：「派誰來都可以，就是小陳來不行。」不得已只好辭職，回憶往事，他淡淡地說：「那時太年輕，不懂事。」
回到家鄉，他決定開冰果室，但賣冰夏天忙死、冬天餓死，撐了5年，見礁溪開始流行卡拉OK，他決定跟進。
「剛開始很好做，一晚營業額再差都能破萬元，好一點可到3、4萬元，唯一比較討厭的是，有些噗嚨共（指迷糊少根筋）喝了酒會鬧事，稍有分寸的會到店外打，但也把鄰居嚇得半死，掃把、畚箕都要藏好，怕不小心變凶器。」他哭笑不得地說。


烹調牛肉備料時間長，對於體力是一大負荷，陳學良自嘲最難賺的做最久。

陳學良本身不菸不酒，但父親卻常因貪杯惹事，「沒喝酒像貓，一喝就變獅子，會大小聲、鬧事，總之別人都會來找我投訴。」那些酒後鬧事的客人，勾起他從小的噩夢，促使他決定頂讓卡拉OK店。

He was not accustomed to returning to the office to find a person to work for a late arrival, to go to work in the warehouse to play chess, he sued the top, and all his colleagues were offended. After that, although it was dug by another company, the former company with business contacts has clarified: ""Whoever can send it, Xiao Chen can't."" He had to resign and recall the past. He said faintly: ""At that time too Young, not sensible.""
When he returned home, he decided to open the ice fruit room, but the ice was busy in the summer and starved to death in the winter. He supported it for 5 years and saw Jiaoxi began to popular karaoke. He decided to follow up.
""It’s very good at the beginning. The turnover of one night can be broken by 10,000 yuan. It’s better to get 30,000 yuan or 40,000 yuan. The only thing that is more annoying is that some people have a drink. A little bit of it will go out of the store, but it will also scare the neighbors to death, the broom and the hoe will be hidden, afraid of accidentally changing the weapon."" He said with a smile.


Cooking beef has a long time to prepare, and it is a big load for physical strength. Chen Xueliang is the hardest to earn the longest.

In short, others will come to me to complain."" Those who make trouble after drinking, evoke His little nightmare prompted him to decide to let the karaoke shop.
