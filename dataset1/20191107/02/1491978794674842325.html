        <i>A New Zealand jury has been shown CCTV of British backpacker Grace Millane’s movements on the night she died while on a Tinder date with a 27-year-old man. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/07/grace-millane-trial-cctv-footage-shows-uk-backpackers-final-hours">The footage shows the pair visiting numerous bars across Auckland</a>. The man – whose identity has been suppressed by the court – is accused of strangling her in his apartment later that night. He has pleaded not guilty to murder. Millane's body was found crammed inside a suitcase buried in scrubland outside the city.</i>
