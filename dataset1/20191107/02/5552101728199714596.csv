林俊憲再爆　韓國瑜找政治人物施壓台肥借款1400萬
07 Nov 2019, 02:16 by 黃揚明, 林煒凱
國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜被爆曾於2011年購買台北市南港總價7200萬元的豪宅，並於2015年交屋前售出。民進黨立委林俊憲今（7日）再爆料，指韓國瑜在2014年11月要求台肥借他2成房價（約1400萬元），台肥雖在隔月發存證信函拒絕，但韓找了政治人物施壓台肥，讓台肥2015年4月借韓這筆錢，且還准韓分20年償還，「這不就等於是特權嗎？」
林俊憲指出，昨天韓國瑜對買房一事聲明無關特權，但他指控韓施壓台肥借款的部分韓都迴避。他表示，馬政府時期打豪宅，規定台北市7千萬以上豪宅只能貸款5成，韓國瑜買南港豪宅後，「我想請問韓，你有沒有在2014年11月，發存證信函給台肥，要求台肥借你2成的房價的錢？」
林俊憲指出，台肥立刻在隔月發存證信函回覆韓國瑜拒絕借款，然後韓找政治人物去施壓台肥，讓台肥在2015年4月借了1400多萬，大約房價2成的款項。他還指，這些錢原本應該是韓國瑜要繳給台肥的購屋款項，韓卻解釋成欠台肥，特准韓分20年償還，「這不就等於是貸款？這不就等於是特權嗎？不要說一般庶民做不到，就連權貴買房都沒像你韓國瑜這麼厲害！」
林俊憲要求韓國瑜應針對今天的相關質疑提出回應，包括韓說買房不關權貴，那憑什麼可以讓台肥正式發存證信函拒絕借錢後大轉彎？他也說，韓國瑜當年賣房子打了多少通電話？甚至把契約書到處傳，「你都忘記了？」
被問到是否有相關證據，林俊憲說，韓國瑜喬事情、拜託很多人，有多少人會知道，「我講得這麼仔細，韓市長心裡非常清楚。」
不過，本刊查閱韓國瑜今年3月向監察院申報的財產資料，並不包括這筆向台肥借款的相關紀錄。

Lin Junxian re-explodes South Korea Yu to find political figures to pressure Taiwan to borrow 14 million
07 Nov 2019, 02:16 by Huang Yangming, Lin Yikai
KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea Yu, was smashed in 2011 to purchase a luxury home in Taipei’s Nangang with a total price of 72 million yuan, which was sold before the house was handed over in 2015. The Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lin Junxian (7th) broke the news again, saying that South Korea Yu asked Taiwan to borrow 20% of the house price (about 14 million yuan) in November 2014. Although Taiwanese fertilizer refused to issue a certificate every other month, Han found a political figure to pressure Taiwanese fertilizer, let Taiwanese borrow the Korean money in April 2015, and still reimbursed the Korean won for 20 years. ""Is this not a privilege?""
Lin Junxian pointed out that yesterday, South Korea’s statement on the purchase of a house had nothing to do with privilege, but he accused Han’s partial pressure on Taiwan’s borrowing of Taiwan’s borrowing. He said that during the Ma government's period of luxury, it was stipulated that more than 70 million luxury homes in Taipei City could only be loaned 50%. After South Korea's Yu bought a luxury home in Nangang, ""I would like to ask Han, have you issued a letter of deposit to you in November 2014? Taiwanese fertilizer, ask Taifei to borrow 20% of your house price?""
Lin Junxian pointed out that Taiwan Fertilizer immediately sent a letter of deposit to the South Korean Yu to refuse to borrow money. Then Han asked political figures to pressure Taiwanese fertilizer, so that Taiwan Fertilizer borrowed more than 14 million in April 2015, about 20% of the house price. . He also pointed out that the money should have been the amount of money that South Korea Yu had to pay for Taiwanese fertilizer. Han explained that it was owed to Taiwanese fertilizer. The special Korean won was repaid in 20 years. ""Is this not a loan? This is not a privilege. Don't say that the general public can't do it, even the right to buy a house is not as powerful as your Korean Yu!""
Lin Junxian asked South Korea to respond to today's relevant questions, including Han said that buying a house is not a privilege. Why can Taiwan's officially send a certificate to refuse to borrow money and make a big turn? He also said that how many phone calls did South Korea’s Yu sold in the same year? I even passed the contract to the book. ""Have you forgotten?""
When asked if there is any relevant evidence, Lin Junxian said that there are many people in Korea, and how many people will know, ""I am so careful, the mayor of Han is very clear.""
However, the magazine reviewed the property information filed by the Korean Yu in March this year and did not include the relevant record of the loan to Taiwan.
