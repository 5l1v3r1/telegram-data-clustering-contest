People Are Disgusted By T.I.’s Comments About Monitoring His Daughter’s Hymen
07 Nov 2019, 02:37 by Michelle Rennex
In a podcast, T.I. has said that he has attended yearly gynaecologist visits with his daughter, Deyjah Harris, every year since she turned 16 to “check her hymen”.
Rapper T.I., who is no stranger to controversy, has recently come under fire for his recent comments about his daughter and her hymen.
During the now-edited ‘Life Hacks with T.I.’ episode of the Ladies Like Us podcast, hosted by Nazanin Mandi and Nandia Moham, T.I. shared insights into his marriage and parenting style.
According to BuzzFeed News, when the hosts asked T.I if he has had the “sex talk” with his daughters, he spoke about his experience with his daughter, Deyjah Harris.



T.I. explained that he has indeed had the conversation with her and actually accompanies Deyjah, who is now 18 and a college student, on “yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen”.
While the hosts giggled through the clearly awkward topic, T.I. recounted: “There was this one time, I think this might’ve been after her 16th birthday… I put a sticky note on the door: ‘Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30.'”
He continued, “So we’ll go and sit down and the doctor comes and talk, and the doctor’s maintaining a high level of professionalism. He’s like, ‘You know, sir, in order or me to share information’ — I said, ‘Deyjah, they want you to sign this so we can share information. Is there anything you would not want me to know? Oh, ok. See, Doc? Ain’t no problem,'” T.I. said.
Despite the doctor explaining to him that hymen inspection as an indicator as virginity isn’t a valid method, T.I. still insisted. “She don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.'”
He ended the discussion with “I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.”
After the internet caught wind of T.I’s comments, there was major backlash against the rapper.















While others found issues with the fact that “she’s 18” was trending because of the implications that T.I.s actions would be acceptable at any age.









The conversation also brought forth discussion around T.I. and the double standard he holds for his sons over his daughters.
In a clip from the Harris family reality TV show, T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, it’s revealed that King Harris, Deyjahs younger brother, had lost his virginity.
In reaction to finding out, T.I. shared that while he doesn’t want any of his children having sex before it’s time for them, he “will definitely feel different about a boy than I will about a girl and that is just the God’s honest truth.”



Beyond the obvious issues with T.I.s actions, including privacy invasion and his possessive behaviours, studies show that virginity tests actually do not “accurately or reliably predict virginity status”.
Dr Jennifer Gunter, a popular OB/GYN, even weighed in on the matter, likening the hymen to baby teeth which do not serve a purpose beyond the developmental stages.
“The hymen is no virginity indicator. 50% of sexually active teens do not have a disrupted hymen,” she tweeted. “The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing. They are unnecessary and support a disgusting patriarchal trope.”



While neither Deyjah or her representatives have commented on the matter, her likes on Twitter do imply that she, like everyone else, is also uncomfortable with situation.
