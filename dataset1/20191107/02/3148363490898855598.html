      <p>WKBW <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/homeowner-shoots-intruder-during-alleged-home-invasion">reports</a> that 36-year-old Charles Cooper allegedly “forced his way into a home” around 9 p.m. on Tuesday night. The 76-year-old homeowner claimed Cooper pointed a gun in his face while making his entry.</p>
      <p>Cooper was wearing a ski mask, reports say.</p>
      <p>Cooper allegedly ordered the homeowner and his wife to the back of the home. The homeowner went first because he had a shotgun he believed he could retrieve once he got back there.</p>
      <p>The homeowner said, “I hurried up and went down, he didn’t follow me right away. I backed up against the wall, reached up and got the shotgun. I put it behind me. He couldn’t see it. He turned around, dropped his money and he reached down and I shot from the hip. He went down.”</p>
