Actress Anushka Sharma recently made headlines after a former India cricketer accused a national selector of serving tea to her during this year’s cricket World Cup in England. Anushka reacted angrily to allegations made by Farokh Engineer as she posted a hard-hitting statement from all her social media pages. She had ended her statement by claiming that she drank coffee and not tea as was being alleged by Engineer. Within days of her extraordinary public statement on the controversy, Anushka is now facing incessant trolling from her fans after she contradicted herself and wrote that she had enjoyed tea with her husband Virat Kohli and their local hosts in Bhutan during the couple’s recent holiday trip to the kingdom.



Taking to Twitter, Anushka wrote, “Today, during our 8.5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago. While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea?”





No sooner did she share her post along with some breathtaking photos from their trekking expedition, Anushka began to face trolling from her fans with some even accusing her of lying recently when she claimed to not drink tea.









Her fans also poked fun at her when she shared the same photos with identical captions on Instagram. Anushka was reminded about her last statement claiming to not drink tea.






India had lost to New Zealand in the semi-final of this year’s World Cup to get knocked out of the competition. Hosts England later defeated New Zealand in a thrilling encounter to lift their first-ever World Cup.
