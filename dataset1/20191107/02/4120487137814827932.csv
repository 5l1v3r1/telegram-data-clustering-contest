沃尔玛日益在美国零售商竞争中占据上风

07 Nov 2019, 02:54

【新华财经华盛顿讯】美国零售分析公司First Insight近日公布的调查结果显示，在美国两大零售商亚马逊和沃尔玛的消费者之争中，沃尔玛日益获得消费者青睐。随着假日购物季的临近，“消费者争夺战”逐渐拉开帷幕。First Insight分别在2017年12月、2018年9月和今年9月对约1000人进行了三次消费者调查。结果显示，在亚马逊上购买商品的频率达到每月六次或更多的消费者比例已经从2017年的80%降至今年的40%。有55%的受访者表示更喜欢在沃尔玛购物而非亚马逊，这一比例高于去年的约47%。同时，支持亚马逊的受访者比例从2018年的53%降至45%。First Insight首席执行官格雷格佩特罗(Greg Petro)在一次采访中说， “(对消费者来说)，亚马逊快递盒送达时的兴奋感正在减弱亚马逊的新鲜感正在消失”。数据显示，亚马逊在全球范围内共拥有超过1亿Prime会员。但First Insight的报告显示，注册亚马逊高级会员的人数正在下降。在今年的调查中，仅有52%的受访者是会员，低于去年的59%。分析人士认为，近年来亚马逊和沃尔玛纷纷加快交付速度以吸引更多消费者，但报告结果则显示沃尔玛的电子商务投资正在取得回报。亚马逊上月宣布，计划向2000个特定地区的所有Prime会员免费提供两小时内杂货送达服务。此前，亚马逊还宣布对Prime会员提供免费一日送达服务。但是，随着该服务日益扩大，亚马逊为此花费高达数十亿美元，导致其第三季度收支情况未能达到分析师预期。与此同时，沃尔玛也开始在三个城市开启食品杂货配送服务，会员费用在每月19.95美元。与亚马逊相比，沃尔玛拥有前者无法比拟的实体店优势，在全美拥有2700多家在线取货点。数据显示，今年第三季度沃尔玛电子商务销售额大幅增长37%，超出许多投资者预期。佩特罗认为，沃尔玛的送达速度正助力其在短期内实现跨越式发展，并与亚马逊展开激烈竞争。随着今年感恩节、圣诞节和新年购物季的到来，美国零售商之间的“消费者争夺战”将正式敲响。由于今年假日购物季较去年少了6天，各大零售商压力倍增，迫使其采取更快和更加精准的措施吸引消费者。今年以来，亚马逊股价上涨约19%，而沃尔玛股价涨幅则超过26%。同时，亚马逊市值约为8880亿美元，沃尔玛市值则为3340亿美元。

Wal-Mart is gaining the upper hand in the US retailer competition

07 Nov 2019, 02:54

[Xinhua Finance News] The US retail analysis company First Insight recently released a survey showing that Wal-Mart is increasingly favored by consumers in the US consumer dispute between the two major retailers Amazon and Wal-Mart. As the holiday shopping season approached, the “consumer battle” gradually began. First Insight conducted three consumer surveys of approximately 1,000 people in December 2017, September 2018, and September this year. The results show that the proportion of consumers who buy goods on Amazon six or more times a month has dropped from 80% in 2017 to 40% this year. 55% of respondents said they prefer to shop at Wal-Mart instead of Amazon, which is about 47% higher than last year. At the same time, the proportion of respondents who supported Amazon fell from 53% in 2018 to 45%. Greg Petro, chief executive of First Insight, said in an interview that ""(for consumers), the excitement of Amazon Express boxes is weakening Amazon's freshness is disappearing."" The data shows that Amazon has more than 100 million Prime members worldwide. But First Insight's report shows that the number of registered Amazon premium members is declining. In this year's survey, only 52% of respondents were members, down from 59% last year. Analysts believe that in recent years, Amazon and Wal-Mart have accelerated delivery speeds to attract more consumers, but the report shows that Wal-Mart's e-commerce investment is paying off. Amazon announced last month that it plans to offer free grocery delivery within two hours to all Prime members in 2000 specific regions. Previously, Amazon also announced a free one-day delivery service for Prime members. However, as the service grew, Amazon spent billions of dollars on it, causing its third-quarter revenue and expenditure to fail to meet analyst expectations. At the same time, Wal-Mart began to open grocery distribution services in three cities, with membership costs of $19.95 per month. Compared with Amazon, Wal-Mart has the advantage of a physical store that the former can't match, with more than 2,700 online pick-up points in the United States. Data show that in the third quarter of this year, Wal-Mart e-commerce sales increased by 37%, exceeding many investors' expectations. Petrova believes that Wal-Mart's delivery speed is helping to achieve leapfrog development in the short term and to compete fiercely with Amazon. With the arrival of the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year shopping season this year, the “consumer battle” between US retailers will officially ring. Since this year's holiday shopping season is six days less than last year, the pressure on major retailers has doubled, forcing them to adopt faster and more precise measures to attract consumers. Since the beginning of this year, Amazon's share price has risen by about 19%, while Wal-Mart's share price has risen by more than 26%. At the same time, Amazon's market capitalization is about $88.8 billion, and Wal-Mart's market value is $334 billion.
