【對不起牛肉麵4】棄大把加盟金　只為把配方留給同鄉人

病後為了調整步調，陳學良調整營業時間，1星期開店3天，剩下3天改做宅配，他直言：「做宅配並沒有比較輕鬆，只是少了11點一定得開店的時間壓力，我不會那麼緊張，可以慢慢做，把每一個步驟工序做得更仔細，讓客人一吃就有驚豔的感覺。」週日則帶著自己煮的牛肉麵、好料到療養院陪父親，2個孩子雖對下廚沒興趣，卻發揮電機、資工所學專長，幫忙架設官網與管理網購訂單。



陳學良的好手藝吸引不少人捧著鈔票想拜師、加盟，但他只收同鄉林志勝為徒，希望把手藝留在頭城。原本從事金工加工的林志勝，因產業沒落，6年前偕妻子李奕霏三顧茅廬，陳學良說：「想一想，年輕人既然這麼有心想要做，好吧！就教他了。」


牛三寶是龍記尚品牛肉麵秒殺單品，開店半小時內必售罄。（260元／份）

從最基本的切肉、炒料、熬湯，陳學良手把手不藏私地傳授，2個月後，林志勝在礁溪開黔龍坊牛肉麵，打著龍記尚品嫡傳大弟子門號，連菜單、價格也大同小異，但生意卻是每況愈下。陳學良說得含蓄：「可能年輕人有自己的想法，想變化吧！這也是人之常情啦！」


陳學良2年前將本店經營權交給徒弟林志勝，如今登記在李奕霏（右）名下。

考量體力不若當年， 2年前陳學良將頭城區實體店面經營權轉讓給徒弟，自己則全心放在網購宅配。「師傅的招牌不好扛，他常好意繞進來看一看，我都很怕哪裡又讓他覺得不對勁，有次客人給我2顆星評價，他馬上傳訊息來關切。」林志勝一提起陳學良，難掩敬畏三分情緒，他自嘲：「師傅做到心臟怦怦怦，我當他徒弟也一樣，去醫院都是看同一科，現在藥吃得比他還多，心悸、胸悶、緊張都有傳承到啦！」


熟客除了內用也會選購冷凍包，一發現是陳學良本人親送，當場和他切磋起手藝。

去年3月，林志勝將頭城老店登記在李奕霏名下，雖仍由林志勝掌杓，但有老顧客覺得口味變了樣，認為湯頭花椒太過搶戲，不過老店生意不受易主影響，依舊大排長龍。看在陳學良眼裡，他淡淡地說：「既然已選擇放手（指不開店）就灑脫一點，反正1個問題我只說3次，再講就沒意思了。」


龍記尚品牛肉麵每天只賣3小時，被向隅者戲稱「對不起牛肉麵」。

In order to adjust the pace after the illness, Chen Xueliang adjusted the business hours, opened the shop for 3 days in 1 week, and changed the house to the house for 3 days. He said bluntly: ""It is not easy to do the housework, but it is only 11 points less time to open the store. I will not So nervous, you can do it slowly, and make every step of the process more careful, so that guests will have a stunning feeling when they eat."" On Sunday, they brought their own beef noodles and expected them to accompany the father in the sanatorium. Not interested in the kitchen, but to play the expertise of the motor, capital, to help set up the official website and manage online shopping orders.



Chen Xueliang's good craftsmanship attracted many people to hold the banknotes and wanted to join the teacher. He only accepted the fellow Lin Zhisheng as a disciple and hoped to leave his hand in the city. Lin Zhisheng, who was originally engaged in metalworking, was declining because of the industry. Six years ago, his wife Li Wei was in charge of Mao, and Chen Xueliang said: ""Think about it, since young people want to do so, okay! Just teach him.""


Niu Sanbao is a single-piece beef noodle with Longji Shangpin, which must be sold within half an hour. (260 yuan / share)

From the most basic meat, stir-fry, soup, Chen Xueliang did not hide and teach privately. Two months later, Lin Zhisheng opened the Longfang beef noodle in Jiaoxi, playing the dragon disciples and rumors of the big disciple, even the menu. The price is similar, but the business is getting worse. Chen Xueliang said implicitly: ""Maybe young people have their own ideas and want to change! This is also human nature!""


Chen Xueliang handed over the management of the store to his apprentice Lin Zhisheng two years ago, and is now registered under the name of Li Wei (right).

Considering that physical strength is not the same as that of the past year, Chen Xueliang transferred the management rights of the physical storefront in the first district to the apprentice two years ago, and he devoted himself to online shopping. ""The master's sign is not good. He often looks around and looks at it. I am very afraid of what makes him feel wrong. Some guests gave me 2 stars to evaluate. He uploaded a message to worry about it."" Lin Zhisheng mentioned Chen Xueliang, it is difficult to conceal the three-pointed feelings. He laughed at himself: ""The master is doing the heart, and I am the same as his apprentice. I went to the hospital to see the same subject. Now I have more medicine than him. I feel palpitations, chest tightness, nervousness. There are inheritance!""


In addition to the internal use, the regular customers will also purchase the frozen package. One of them is Chen Xueliang's personal delivery, and he and his work on the spot.

In March of last year, Lin Zhisheng registered the old store in the first city in the name of Li Wei. Although Lin Zhisheng was still in the palm of his hand, some old customers felt that the taste had changed. They thought that the soup was too popular, but the old store business was not affected by the owner. , still long queues. In the eyes of Chen Xueliang, he said faintly: ""Since I have chosen to let go (meaning not opening a store), I will be free and easy. Anyway, I only say 3 times for one question. It would be boring to talk about it.""


Long Kee Shang Pin Beef Noodle only sells for 3 hours a day, and is nicknamed ""Sorry Beef Noodle"" to the singer.
