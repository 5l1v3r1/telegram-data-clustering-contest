【對不起牛肉麵番外篇】牛肉賣客人2子只能喝湯　身高飆190

正所謂親情無價，宜蘭排隊名店龍記尚品牛肉麵創辦人陳學良，被熟客私下封為孝子，過去開店時，不論生意再好他都堅持週日休息，週週定帶著自己煮的牛肉、好料，探視住在療養院的父親。有趣的是，因店內生意太好，牛肉都被客人買光，2個兒子只剩牛肉湯可喝，加入蔬果、中藥材每日現敖的牛肉湯，2子頭好壯壯身高飆破180、190公分。



陳學良小學二年級母親病逝，青少年時期，父親忙著在外討生活，一不順心就借酒澆愁，酒後會打罵孩子，「像在打共匪一樣，養成我一看不對勁，拔腿就往外逃，等他火氣消了就沒事。」也許是童年的遺憾，陳學良開店不論再忙，他絕不犧牲親情，和2個兒子無話不談，他強調：「賺錢有數啦，親情最重要，小孩子你要陪在他旁邊跟他一起成長，他就永遠不會學壞。」


陳學良（左）是宜蘭頭城排隊名店龍記尚品牛肉麵創始人，2年前轉為製作冷凍包。

父親長年酗酒，把胃都喝壞了，陳學良記取教訓不菸不酒，他自豪地說：「我看太多人抽菸、喝酒把身體搞壞，我當兵是政戰士，負責管理香菸發放，整個營部600多人，都是我負責登記、收錢，三節配給我的額度都讓給同袍。」


手工製作的冷凍包數量有限，老闆娘潘美玲每天為了調配訂單傷透腦筋。

注重身教言教的他，從小灌輸2個兒子「你不要想去占人家的便宜，人家就占不了你的便宜」，妻子潘美玲吐槽另一半常恐嚇孩子不認真念書，以後就到店裡煮牛肉麵。此話曾傳到一位醫師熟客耳裡，竟依樣畫葫回家威脅孩子：「人家龍記的小孩如果書讀不好，還可以去賣牛肉麵，當醫生要考執照的，你們能做什麼？」成為地方趣談。

長子學生時期暑假曾想到店裡拜父親為師，怎料才在鍋爐前站10分鐘就滿身大汗，從此打消念頭。對此，陳學良反倒看得開，「人家說做一行怨一行，沒有人會把自己不喜歡做的事情，留給下一代去做，孩子有自己的思維、造詣，只要不學壞、對自己的行為負責，我都會支持。」


陳學良是地方上有名的孝子，父親生前雖然住在療養院，他每週日休假必定驅車前往探望陪伴，圖為帶父親吃大餐。（陳學良提供）

兄弟倆雖然對煮牛肉麵沒興趣，卻分別發揮電機、資工所學專長，幫忙撰寫麵店官網與管理網路訂單，成為陳學良最強而有力的後盾。


烹煮牛肉費時費工，對62歲的陳學良來說，是一大體力考驗。

The so-called family is priceless, Yilan line up the famous store Longji Shangpin beef noodle founder Chen Xueliang, was secretly privately sealed as a dutiful son, in the past when the store opened, no matter how good business he insisted on Sunday rest, Zhou Zhouding with his own boiled beef, good Expect to visit the father who lives in the sanatorium. Interestingly, because the business in the store is too good, the beef is bought by the guests. The two sons only have the beef soup to drink, and the beef soup with fruits and vegetables and Chinese herbal medicines is added every day. The 2 sons are strong and smashed. 180, 190 cm.

When Chen Xueliang opened the store no matter how busy he was, he never sacrificed his family and talked with his two sons. He stressed: ""There are a lot of money, the most important family, the children. If you want to stay with him and grow up with him, he will never learn bad.""

My father has been drinking alcohol for a long time, and his stomach has been ruined. Chen Xueliang remembers the lessons and does not smoke or drink. He proudly said: ""I see too many people smoking and drinking to ruin their bodies. I am a political warrior and responsible for managing cigarettes. There are more than 600 people in the entire camp. I am responsible for registering and collecting money. The amount allocated to me in the three sections is given to the same robes.""


The number of hand-made frozen packs is limited, and the boss's mother, Pan Meiling, has a daily headache for the deployment of orders.

He pays attention to teaching and teaching. He has instilled two sons from childhood. ""You don't want to take advantage of people's cheapness. People can't take advantage of your cheapness.""

This statement was passed to a doctor's customer, and he went home to threaten the child: ""If the child's book is not good, you can go to sell beef noodles.

During the summer vacation of the eldest son, I thought of my father as a teacher in the store. It was only after 10 minutes in front of the boiler that I was sweating and I was dispelled. In this regard, Chen Xueliang turned his back on it. ""The people say that they are doing a line of resentment. No one will leave what they don't like to do to the next generation. The children have their own thinking and accomplishments, as long as they don't learn bad, they are themselves. I am responsible for the behavior, I will support it.""


Chen Xueliang is a well-known filial son in the locality. Although his father lived in a nursing home before his death, he must drive to visit and accompany him on a Sunday vacation. The picture shows his father taking a big meal. (courtesy of Chen Xueliang)

Although the brothers were not interested in boiled beef noodles, they used the expertise of the motor and the laboratories to help write the official website of the noodle shop and manage the network orders, which became the strongest and powerful backing of Chen Xueliang.


Cooking beef takes time and labor, and for the 62-year-old Chen Xueliang, it is a big physical test.
