      <p>BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials say the country’s main port has reopened after being blocked by protesters for five days.</p>
      <p>The officials said scores of trucks were picking up imports Thursday from Umm Qasr port in the country’s south. The port houses a vital oil terminal and is an entry point for food and basic goods.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.</p>
      <p>Iraq has been gripped by protests in the capital Baghdad and across most of its southern provinces. Scores of people have been killed by security forces.</p>
      <p>The protests are a continuation of the economically-driven demonstrations that began in early October. They’ve since turned deadly as security forces cracked down, using live ammunition.</p>
