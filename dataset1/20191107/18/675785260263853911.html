      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Toronto Wolfpack have confirmed the signing of Sonny Bill Williams on a bumper two-year contract.</p>
      <p>Cross-code superstar Sonny Bill, 34, will again make the switch to rugby league to play in Super League next season with the Canadian side.</p>
      <p>Toronto sealed their place in the top flight with victory over Featherstone in the Million Pound Game last month and have now signalled their intent with the signing of Williams.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander, who crashed out of the Rugby World Cup with the All Blacks at the semi-final stage having twice won the tournament previously, will earn in the region of £5million over the course of his contract making it the most lucrative in the history of either code.</p>
      <p>“Toronto Wolfpack has established themselves as a multicultural and economic powerhouse, not only in the city but across the world," Williams said on joining the Wolfpack.</p>

      <p>"The club has big ambitions and big goals. I want to be part of all this and do all I can to help reach those lofty goals. On the field, I’d like to bring high-quality play and do all I can for the betterment of the team.</p>
      <p>"Off the field, I’d like to use my experience to mentor the young players and be helpful where I am needed. Super League will be a new challenge and one I’m looking forward to. It will be a new experience and one I’m ready to embrace.”</p>
      <p>Toronto coach Brian McDermott added: "We have signed one of the highest-profile rugby players, if not sports stars in the world.</p>
      <p>"He will enhance the global game of rugby by being in Toronto and certainly push the brand of the Wolfpack onto another level.</p>

      <p>"The main point of excitement for our club is that we are signing a great Rugby League player who has the hunger to be successful in Super League much as he was in the NRL and Rugby Union.”</p>
      <p>Australia coach Mal Meninga floated the possibility of a tour match between the Kangaroos and Toronto prior to next year's Ashes Tests on the back of the Williams signing.</p>
      <p>He said: "Sonny Bill Williams will provide an immediate impact for rugby league in the Northern Hemisphere and for the development of rugby in North America.</p>
      <p>"When the Kangaroos tour England in 2020 – we will look forward to playing a warm-up game against the Wolfpack as it would create a lot of excitement for the sport.”</p>
      <p>In two previous stints in rugby league, Sonny Bill won the NRL with Canterbury Bulldogs and Sydney Roosters.</p>
