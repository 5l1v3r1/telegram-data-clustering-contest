      <h1>Cancel Santa, The Knight Before Christmas Trailer Is the Best Gift of All</h1>

      <p>Vanessa Hudgens is quickly becoming the heir to the Netflix Christmas movie throne. Appearing in her second Yuletide-centered rom-com in two years, she’s gone from switching with princesses to falling for knights. <i>The Knight Before Christmas</i> <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a26885326/vanessa-hudgens-the-knight-before-christmas-movie/">hits Netflix</a> on November 21, and its first trailer is everything you imagined and more.</p>
      <p>It begins with voiceover from Hudgens’ character Brooke, who laments, “We all grow up fantasizing about finding true love, a knight in shining armor, living happily ever after. But that’s all it is: a fantasy.” Cut to medieval knight Sir Cole (Josh Whitehouse) appearing—by magic only made possible in a Netflix original—in the modern day.</p>
      <p>What happens next can only be described as gender-reversed <i>Enchanted</i>. There’s the knight learning what a car radio is, chopping down a Christmas tree with a sword, and referring to Brooke as “m’lady” when he rescues her from slipping on ice. And is that a makeover montage we smell?</p>
      <p><i>The Knight Before Christmas</i> is essentially a stocking stuffed to the brim with all the holiday movie cliches you could ask for, following in the path of 2018’s <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a25224958/the-princess-switch-netflix-review/">The Princess Switch</a>,</i> which saw Hudgens playing two roles as a royal and a commoner who switch places when they realize they look identical. As for Hudgens’ future as the patron saint of Netflix festivity, it’s looking pretty secure. In 2020, <i>The Princess Switch </i>is <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a29636940/the-princess-switch-sequel-twitter-reactions/">getting a sequel</a>. After that, may we suggest: <i>The Knight After Christmas </i>sequel<i> </i>for a 2021 release?</p>
