The man left the area in a silver or gray late 2000’s model Lincoln Town car, al.com reported.
Blanchard was reported missing the next day. Her black 2017 Honda CRV was later found abandoned at an apartment complex more than 50 miles away, in Montgomery. Police said the car contained evidence that Blanchard had been harmed.
Police say they want to speak with the man as part of the investigation into Blanchard's disappearance.
