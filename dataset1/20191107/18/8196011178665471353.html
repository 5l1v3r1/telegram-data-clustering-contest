      <p>Waterford Council has approved planning for one of the country’s largest solar farms in a scenic region of mid-Waterford.</p>
      <p>Dublin-based Highfield Solar Ltd had sought 10-year permission for a development across four distinct land sections, spanning 270 acres in the county’s Copper Coast region.</p>
      <p>There are 120 houses within a 500-metre boundary of a site nestling between Waterford greenway, Copper Coast Geopark and the Comeragh Mountains.</p>
      <p>The nearest settlement is Tidy Towns old medal winner Stradbally village, some 800 metres from the development boundary.</p>
      <p>The planning application drew 32 submissions from locals opposing the development.</p>
      <p>Most objectors feared the farm would be out of sync with the agricultural, recreational and tourism profile of the area.</p>
      <p>Three landowners in the region have submitted written consent to have the company apply for permission to site the farm on their properties.</p>
      <p>Permission was granted with 22 conditions.</p>
      <p>Community activist Anne Troy said locals are “gutted” but believes that “not everyone realises the scale” of the development.</p>
      <p>“Whichever direction you take, it will be a sea of glass, visible from both Mahon Falls and Waterford greenway,” she said.</p>
      <p>The activist, who has campaigned successfully against two windfarm proposals in the region, believes the planning will be appealed to Bord Pleanála.</p>
      <p>Ms Troy says her concerns are not derived merely from landscape or visual factors, claiming she is responding to health fears for her grandchildren.</p>
      <p>“We are talking about battery packs, power stations and 100 KW lines,” she said. “Highfield Solar want to store 110 batteries in steel containers. They haven’t sought planning for a substation, which means accessing the national grid via overhead lines”.</p>
      <p>Highfield Solar already had planning for a 27 acre solar farm in in Kilmacthomas, after Bord Pleanála overturned the council’s planning refusal earlier this year.</p>
      <p>That site rests on a busy junction between the old and new N25 route, bringing TII objections on the grounds of possible glare on motorists.</p>
      <p>The latest permission comes weeks after Bord Pleanála upheld planning granted by Waterford Council for another solar farm in the Comeragh area.</p>
      <p>That development saw Dublin-based BNRGN Mothel Ltd also seek a 10-year permission, with a view to building a solar farm on two sites totalling 95 acres, with a projected lifespan of 30 years.</p>
      <p>The company also received permission for a 110 KV substation by which the farm will connect to the national grid.</p>
      <p>Planning again included 22 conditions.</p>
