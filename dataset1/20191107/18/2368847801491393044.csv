川普關稅壓力生效 中國首次重判9名芬太尼毒販

07 Nov 2019, 18:48

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月08日訊】芬太尼在美國造成大量死亡，而中國是芬太尼的主要來源。川普政府已將管制芬太尼納入美中貿易談判。在承諾管制近一年之後，中共首次採取實質行動，重判9名中國芬太尼毒販。這也是美中第一次聯手打擊芬太尼走私者。
11月7日，9名中國芬太尼毒販在河北邢台中級法院被判刑。首犯劉勇被判死刑，緩期兩年執行。另外兩名被告蔣菊華和王鳳璽被判處無期徒刑。其餘6人分別獲刑6個月到10年不等。
邢台中級法院宣判當天，中共国家禁毒委员会办公室副主任于海斌与美国国土安全部驻华官员摩尔在當地举行了记者会。中共官员表示，中方正在根据美国情报部门提供的线索，追查三个芬太尼走私贩运网络，在邢台破获的走私贩运网络只是其中之一。
邢台中級法院透露，本案是第一宗中美聯手調查與芬太尼走私有關的案件。該案始於2017年，當時中共公安部禁毒局根據美國邊檢單位提供的線索，在上海與江蘇發現一個販毒網絡，查扣了11.9公斤芬太尼。
據《紐約時報》報導，美國新奧爾良緝毒局2017年8月的一次逮捕，引發了針對一個龐大地下芬太尼生產網絡的國際性調查。檢方指控劉勇精心策劃和組織了這一網絡，其中包括上海和江蘇的一個實驗室及兩個配送中心。
此案拖延兩年之久才宣判，顯然和政治背景有關。目前中國經濟局勢日益嚴峻，中共正在向美方釋放「善意」，以促成美國簽署「美中第一階段貿易協議」，暫緩貿易戰。
就在今年8月，中共官方還在極力推卸責任，聲稱美國芬太尼氾濫是因為「自己管制不嚴」，和中方無關。當時川普政府剛剛宣布對中國商品加徵關稅，理由是中共拒不兌現管制芬太尼和採購美國農產品的承諾。
去年12月的川習會上，習近平承諾打擊中國芬太尼的生產和走私。之後中共官方將芬太尼列入管製品，但並無實質行動，中國製芬太尼依然在美國氾濫。
芬太尼比海洛因毒性強50倍，每年導致數萬美國人死亡。美國官方報告指，美國的芬太尼主要來自中國，輸美渠道包括郵寄和經手墨西哥毒販。而多家媒體實地調查顯示，芬太尼製造和對外走私在中國近乎半公開，生產和銷售網點遍及大江南北十幾個省市。
中國雖然是芬太尼的最大產地，但中國本地需求極小，生產的芬太尼主要走私美國和加拿大等地。專家指，芬太尼可能是中共對美「超限戰」的一部分，部分美國政客甚至將中共對美輸出芬太尼稱為現代版的「鴉片戰爭」。

Trump tariff pressure is in force China first sentenced 9 fentanyl drug dealers

07 Nov 2019, 18:48

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 08, 2019] Fentanyl caused a large number of deaths in the United States, and China is the main source of fentanyl. The Trump administration has incorporated fentanyl into the US-China trade negotiations. Nearly a year after the promised control, the CCP took concrete action for the first time and sentenced nine Chinese fentanyl drug dealers. This is also the first time the United States and China have teamed up against the smugglers of Fentanian.
On November 7, nine Chinese fentanyl drug dealers were sentenced in the Xingtai Intermediate Court in Hebei. The first offender Liu Yong was sentenced to death and suspended for two years. The other two defendants, Jiang Juhua and Wang Fengqi, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The remaining six were sentenced to six months to 10 years respectively.
On the day of the Xingtai Intermediate People's Court's verdict, Yu Haibin, deputy director of the Office of the National Anti-Drug Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Moore Moore, the US Department of Homeland Security, held a local press conference. Officials at the Chinese Communist Party said that China is following up on three fentanyl smuggling trafficking networks based on clues provided by US intelligence agencies. The smuggling traffic network that was uncovered in Xingtai is only one of them.
The Xingtai Intermediate Court revealed that the case was the first case in which China and the United States jointly investigated the smuggling related to fentanyl. The case began in 2017, when the Anti-Drug Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China found a drug trafficking network in Shanghai and Jiangsu based on the clues provided by the US border inspection unit, and seized 11.9 kilograms of fentanyl.
According to the New York Times, an arrest by the New Orleans Drug Enforcement Administration in August 2017 triggered an international investigation into a large underground fentanyl production network. The prosecution accused Liu Yong of carefully planning and organizing the network, including a laboratory in Shanghai and Jiangsu and two distribution centers.
The case was delayed for two years before it was pronounced, apparently related to the political background. At present, China's economic situation is getting more and more serious. The CCP is releasing ""goodwill"" to the US to promote the signing of the ""US-China first-phase trade agreement"" and suspend the trade war.
Just in August this year, the CCP official still tried to shirk its responsibility, claiming that the US fentanyl was flooded because of ""dignity of its own control"" and had nothing to do with China. At that time, the Trump administration had just announced a tariff on Chinese goods on the grounds that the CCP refused to honor its commitment to control fentanyl and purchase US agricultural products.
At the Sichuan Learning Conference in December last year, Xi Jinping promised to crack down on the production and smuggling of Chinese fentanyl. After the CCP officially listed fentanyl as a pipe product, there was no substantive action, and the Chinese-made fentanyl was still flooding in the United States.
Fentanyl is 50 times more toxic than heroin and causes tens of thousands of American deaths each year. According to US official reports, the US fentanyl is mainly from China, and the channels for exporting to the United States include mailing and handling Mexican drug dealers. According to a number of media field surveys, fentanyl manufacturing and external smuggling are almost semi-open in China, with production and sales outlets covering more than a dozen provinces and cities in the north and south.
Although China is the largest producer of fentanyl, China's local demand is extremely small, and the production of fentanyl mainly smuggles the United States and Canada. Experts say that fentanyl may be part of the CCP's ""super-limit war"" against the United States. Some American politicians even referred to the CCP's export of fentanyl to the modern version of the ""Opper War.""
