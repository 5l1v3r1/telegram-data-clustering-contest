      <p>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. - Minnesota-based HealthPartners says it's closing 30 retail pharmacies as well as its mail-order pharmacy operation next year.</p>
      <p>The nonprofit health insurer saidÂ about 300 jobs will be eliminated, including about 100 pharmacists.</p>
      <p>A HealthPartners vice president, Scott Schnuckle, says consumer preferences and pharmacy economics have changed to favor large-scale organizations that can provide extended hours, drive-through pickup and other conveniences.</p>
      <p>HealthPartners also runs clinics and hospitals in Minnesota and Wisconsin, including Regions Hospital in St. Paul and Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, The Star Tribune reported.</p>
      <p>Besides hospitals, HealthPartners runs 55 primary care clinics, 22 urgent care centers and 24 dental clinics.</p>
      <p>The pharmacies are expected to close early next year.</p>
