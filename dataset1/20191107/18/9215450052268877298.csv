07 Nov 2019, 18:00 by 熱話
BNO申請是近期的熱話之一！不少港人在持有特區護照的同時，都想擁有BNO，除了因為政治因素外，亦因為BNO好處多多，如有多個免簽證國家，去旅行就更加方便！而且英國護照署簡化了BNO續期（BNO renew）的步驟，現時只要在官網遞交申請並上載證件相，即可為BNO續期。然而，很多人對BNO副簽（Countersign）、申請資格及相片要求存有疑問，或是面對遺失BNO的情況，有意為BNO續期的人士，可以留意以下的續領教學！

BNO港人有居英權？
英國下議院外交事務專責委員會發表報告，由於香港自反修例風波引發的一連串社會事件，認為香港「一國兩制」的高度自治受威脅，故此建議英國政府向持有BNO護照的香港人賦予居英權。對於某些正考慮移居外國的人士絕對是一大喜訊，若果你的BNO已過期，就要快點跟以下指示為BNO續期了！
3個BNO申請資格
一些港人的BNO已經過期超過10年，是否還可以補領呢？事實上，BNO申請資格有以下3個，只要符合以下條件，即使逾期多年仍然可以補領。

曾於 1997年7月1日前成功申請過BNO的港人，不接受新申請。
BNO不接受新申請，從未持有BNO，或1997年7月1日或以後出生人士均無法申請。
擁有BNO的家長曾經在護照內「included child」一欄填寫過當時未滿16歲子女的姓名，即使子女從沒申請BNO passport， 也擁有BNO資格， 可以申請BNO護照。

BNO續期 renew步驟教學
BNO續期可在英國護照署的網站理，申請可按：HM Passport Office。現時新系統步驟較以往簡單，主要是選擇題及填寫個人資料的填充題，其後上載個人相片，並以Visa或Master信用卡付款即可。申請人在進入BNO續期的頁面後，會出現以下數條問題，接下來將逐步拆解BNO網上續期的申請方法：

Do you live in the UK? 你是否住在英國？（一般填「No」，然後在下方選擇居住的國家或地區）
Date of birth 填寫出生日期
Have you had a UK passport before? 你曾否擁有英國護照？（此處應填「Yes」）
Is your passport lost or stolen? 你的護照是否已遺失或被盗？
When was your passport issued?  填寫BNO的簽發日期
Which is your passport issuing authority? 誰發行你的護照？（此處應選「Other」）
Is your passport damaged? 你的護照是否損壞？
Do you have a naturalisation or registration certificate? 你有否申請歸化入籍英國證明？
Do you have any passports from other countries? 你是否擁有其他國家的護照？
Which country were you born in? 你在哪個國家出生？

回答完所有問題後，系統會提示你重新申請英國護照（Apply for a first UK passport），按「Continue」繼續，然後按指示上載照片及列出所需文件，並以 Visa 或 Master 信用卡付款。成功付款後，申請人會收到確認電郵和短訊，可直接將文件用快遞或空郵掛號形式寄到英國護照署，建議用軟墊信封作保護。新的BNO約需4至6個星期寄回香港，而且申請文件會和BNO分開寄回。

BNO費用

34頁護照（10年有效期）連運費：£105.86（約1,031港元）
50頁護照（10年有效期）連運費：£115.86（約1,129港元）

申請BNO的相片要求
BNO續期的證件相可用自拍形式拍攝，系統上已列明證件相的要求，包括使用灰色或白色等純淺色背景，需包含頭部、肩膀和上半身等部位。另外不能有微笑、皺眉等表情，背景不能有陰影，眼鏡亦不能反光。
申請人可上載符合要求的照片，系統接受jpg及jpeg的檔案類型，惟證件相的大小需介乎50KB至10MB。上載照片後，系統會即時判斷相片是否符合要求。

BNO申請所需文件

已過期的舊 BNO 正本（未剪角）。若已經遺失，需要另外填妥「遺失或被盜護照通知書（LS01）」。
香港永久性居民身份證的彩色影印本（包括正面及背面）。
現時持有的任何未過期之其他國家護照全彩影印本（每一頁，包括封面封底），或可以把護照正本（如特區護照）寄去申請。
出世紙正本 或 雙面的彩色影印本。
12個月內的住址證明文件：需要文件正本，文件上要現實申請人姓名、地址、居住地，如政府信件、銀行信件等。
父母雙方的出世紙正本
父母結婚證明正本

如果未能提供任何一樣文件，可以書面解釋。準備好所有資料後便可寄回英國護照署，地址為：HM Passport Office, INT-E-FTA, (你的PEX no.申請編號), 101 Old Hall Street, Liverpool, L3 9BP, UK
BNO副簽 Countersign 要求
每次提起BNO續期，人們總會因BNO副簽（Countersign）的重重步驟而卻步。其實並非所有BNO申請都需要提交副簽，申請人在填寫聲明書時，系統會顯示其申請是否需要副簽。如需副簽，副簽人要在聲名書上填寫個人資料和簽署。
若申請人出現以下其中一種情況就要副簽：

舊 BNO 護照遺失、被偷及損壞
樣貌跟舊護照相片很大變化
個人資料有重大改變
被歸類為「First Adult Passport」、「First Child Passport」

BNO副簽人士的要求如下：

需與申請人認識 2 年或以上，非家庭成員
持有英國或歐盟護照
官方接受的專業人士，如：會計師、記者、護士、老師等

申請人要留意，要在遞交申請後90天內提供所有文件，否則申請會被取消，而且不會獲得退款！

遺失BNO的處理方法
如果申請人的BNO被盜或是遺失了，就要向英國護照署報失。申請人在英國護照署網站續領BNO時，在BNO是否遺失的問題上答「Yes」，系統就會出現報失頁面，申請人要先在網上取消之前的 BNO，之後才能重新申請。
不過，如果申請人的BNO被盜，除了網上報失，申請人還需提供報失紙。申請人可以在英國護照署網站找到「LS01」的表格，填寫後可連同證明文件寄往英國護照署。
BNO好處及免簽證國家
香港曾經是英國殖民地，所以部分在回歸前出生的港人可同時持有特區護照和BNO。根據亨氏護照指數 Henley Passport Index 2019年度全球護照排行榜，BNO處於第6位，免簽國／地區達185個；而香港今年則以169個免簽國／地區排第19位。換言之，BNO護照是全球最方便的護照之一，免簽證國家較多。

[BNO application, renewal teaching] BNO Hong Kong people have the right to live in the UK? New system steps, deputy sign, photo request lazy bag 2019
07 Nov 2019, 18:00 by hot words
BNO application is one of the recent hot words! Many Hong Kong people want to have a BNO while holding a SAR passport. Apart from political factors, and because of the many benefits of BNO, if there are multiple visa-free countries, it is more convenient to travel! Moreover, the British Passport Office has simplified the BNO renew process. At present, as long as the application is submitted on the official website and the documents are uploaded, the BNO can be renewed. However, many people have doubts about the BNO deputy (Countersign), eligibility and photo requirements, or in the face of the loss of BNO, those who intend to renew BNO, you can pay attention to the following renewed teaching!

BNO Hong Kong people have the right to live in the UK?
The British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee issued a report. Due to a series of social incidents triggered by the anti-reforms in Hong Kong, the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" is threatened. Therefore, it is recommended that the British government grant the right to reside in the Hong Kong people holding BNO passports. . For some people who are considering moving abroad, it is definitely a good news. If your BNO has expired, you should follow the instructions below to renew your BNO!
3 BNO application qualifications
Some Hong Kong people's BNOs have expired for more than 10 years. Can they still be replenished? In fact, there are three BNO application qualifications, as long as the following conditions are met, even if they are overdue for many years, they can still be replaced.

Hong Kong people who have successfully applied for BNO before July 1, 1997 will not accept new applications.
BNO does not accept new applications, never holds BNO, or people born on or after July 1, 1997 cannot apply.
Parents who have BNO have filled in the name of the child under the age of 16 in the ""included child"" column of the passport. Even if the child has never applied for a BNO passport, he or she has BNO status and can apply for a BNO passport.

BNO renewal renew step teaching
The renewal of the BNO can be found on the website of the British Passport Office. The application can be made by HM Passport Office. At present, the new system steps are simpler than before. They mainly choose multiple questions and fill in the personal information, then upload personal photos and pay with Visa or Master credit card. After the applicant enters the BNO renewal page, the following problems will occur. Next, the application method for BNO online renewal will be gradually dismantled:

Do you live in the UK? Do you live in the UK? (Generally fill in ""No"", then select the country or region where you live below)
Date of birth Fill in the date of birth
Have you had a UK passport before? Have you ever had a UK passport? (This should be filled with ""Yes"")
Is your passport lost or stolen? Has your passport been lost or stolen?
When was your passport issued? Fill in the date of issue of BNO
Which is your passport issuing authority? Who issued your passport? (This should choose ""Other"")
Is your passport damaged? Is your passport damaged?
Do you have a naturalisation or registration certificate? Have you applied for a naturalization certificate?
Do you have any passports from other countries? Do you have a passport from another country?
Which country were you born in? Which country were you born in?

After answering all the questions, you will be prompted to apply for a first UK passport, press ""Continue"" to continue, then follow the instructions to upload photos and list the required documents, and pay by Visa or Master credit card. After successful payment, the applicant will receive a confirmation email and SMS, and can directly send the documents to the UK Passport Office by express or airmail registration. It is recommended to use a soft padded envelope for protection. The new BNO will take about 4 to 6 weeks to be sent back to Hong Kong, and the application documents will be sent back separately from the BNO.

BNO fee

34-page passport (10-year validity) with shipping: £105.86 (approximately HK$1,031)
50-page passport (10-year validity) with shipping: £115.86 (approximately HK$1,129)

Request photo request for BNO
The BNO renewal document can be taken in self-portrait format. The requirements for the document phase are listed on the system, including the use of pure light background such as gray or white, including the head, shoulders and upper body. In addition, you can't have smiles, frowns, etc., the background can't have shadows, and the glasses can't reflect.
Applicants can upload photos that meet the requirements. The system accepts JPG and jpeg file types, but the size of the documents must range from 50KB to 10MB. Once the photo is uploaded, the system will immediately determine if the photo meets the requirements.

BNO application documents required

Old BNO original that has expired (not cut corner). If it has been lost, you will need to complete the Lost or Stolen Passport Notice (LS01).
A color photocopy of the Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card (both front and back).
Full-color photocopies of any passports (including each cover, including the back cover) of any other passports that are not expired, or you can send the original passport (such as a SAR passport) to apply.
Original or double-sided color photocopy of the original paper.
Address proof documents within 12 months: The original documents are required. The documents must be the actual name, address and place of residence of the applicant, such as government letters and bank letters.
Original copy of both parents' papers
Parental marriage certificate original

If you do not provide any of the same documents, you can explain them in writing. Once you have all the information ready, you can return it to the UK Passport Office at HM Passport Office, INT-E-FTA, (your PEX no. application number), 101 Old Hall Street, Liverpool, L3 9BP, UK
BNO Deputy Signature Countersign
Every time you mention a BNO renewal, people will always be deterred by the BNO deputy (Countersign) steps. In fact, not all BNO applications need to submit a deputy. When the applicant fills in the declaration, the system will show whether the application requires a deputy. If you need a deputy sign, the deputy signer must fill in the personal information and sign in the fame book.
If the applicant has one of the following conditions, the deputy sign is required:

Old BNO passport lost, stolen and damaged
Looks and old passport photos vary greatly
Personal data has changed significantly
Classified as ""First Adult Passport"", ""First Child Passport""

The requirements of the BNO deputy are as follows:

Need to know with the applicant for 2 years or more, non-family members
Hold a UK or EU passport
Officially accepted professionals such as accountants, journalists, nurses, teachers, etc.

Applicants should note that all documents should be provided within 90 days of submitting the application, otherwise the application will be cancelled and no refund will be given!

Loss of BNO treatment
If the applicant's BNO is stolen or lost, he or she will report the loss to the UK Passport. When the applicant renews the BNO on the UK Passports website, he or she will answer “Yes” on the question of whether the BNO is lost. The system will report the loss page. The applicant must cancel the previous BNO online before re-applying.
However, if the applicant's BNO is stolen, in addition to the online loss, the applicant is also required to provide a loss of paper. Applicants can find the ""LS01"" form on the UK Passports website and fill it out with the supporting documents to the UK Passport Office.
BNO benefits and visa-free countries
Hong Kong used to be a British colony, so some Hong Kong people born before the reunification can hold both the SAR passport and the BNO. According to the Hennessy Passport Index 2019 Global Passport Rankings, BNO is ranked 6th, with 185 visa-free countries/regions; Hong Kong ranks 19th with 169 visa-free countries/regions this year. In other words, BNO passports are one of the most convenient passports in the world, with more visa-free countries.
