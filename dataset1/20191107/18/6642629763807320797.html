      <p>Bank of England boss Mark Carney has said interest rates may need to be slashed if global and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> headwinds do not ease.</p>
      <p>The Bank governor suggested a cut could be on the cards after two of the central bank's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for lower rates in their latest meeting.</p>
      <p>The committee also suggested that hard times could be ahead, after downgrading economic growth forecasts for the next three years on the back of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a>'s Brexit deal and the continued slowdown in the global economy.</p>
      <p>Two committee members - Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders - made the first call for a cut in more than three years, despite economists predicting the MPC would unanimously hold rates.</p>
      <p>Members of the group had previously suggested they could vote for a cut if Brexit delays continued.</p>
      <p>However, the governor remained coy, suggesting that both a cut or rise could be possible due to the impact of the "pretty big tectonic forces" affecting the world and UK economies.</p>
      <p>He added that an increase "may be needed" if uncertainty around Brexit and the global economy significantly fades.</p>
      <p>The seven-to-two vote was the first time in more than a year that the Bank had faced a split decision and highlighted current appetite for a cut.</p>
      <p>In recent months, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve have both reduced interest rates to deal with economic slowdowns.</p>
      <p>However, Carney said that the prime minister's new Brexit deal has helped to reduce some uncertainty and said that business investment could pick up.</p>
      <p>The MPC increased its forecast for UK GDP in 2019 to 1.4 percent from 1.3 percent as Carney added that he expects the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> will not enter a recession when quarterly GDP figures are revealed.</p>
      <p>Kerstin Braun, president of international trade finance provider Stenn Group, said she suspects interest rates could be cut by early 2020.</p>
      <p>She said: "Mark Carney is right to hold rates for now. Brexit and trade worries have been weighing on the economy and now a snap general election has been thrown into the mix.</p>
      <p>"But even if we avoid a Brexit crash out, or if Brexit is scrapped altogether, the UK is slowly running out of gas, driven down by persistent uncertainty and the flagging global economy.</p>
      <p>"The MPC has been hinting at a rate cut for a while, with or without a confirmed Brexit deal, but it's likely to be at least three more months of paralysis before we see a move."</p>
