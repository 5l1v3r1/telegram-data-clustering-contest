      <h1>Mexico Prison Raid Leads to Chaos in Border City</h1>

      <p>(MEXICO CITY) — Mexican security forces continue working inside a state prison in an operation that set off a night of chaos in Ciudad Juarez.</p>
      <p>State prosecutor Jorge Nava says eight people were murdered in various incidents Tuesday night as some 850 local, state and federal officers raided the prison.</p>
      <p>Four arrested suspects told authorities they were paid in methamphetamine to create a distraction. They burned five private vehicles and 10 buses, including one transporting assembly plant workers. Several workers suffered burns.</p>
      <p>Nava said Wednesday it was a “Machiavellian plan to be able to get authorities to stop the operation.”</p>
      <p>He did not provide details about the murders.</p>
      <p>It was reminiscent of Oct. 17 shootouts in Culiacan that resulted in the release of a son of jailed drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.</p>
