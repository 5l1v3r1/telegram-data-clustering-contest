      <p>Jewellery, sure. Designer clothes, maybe. But sex toys? Not that I’m advocating theft or crime in any way, I’m just struggling to understand who would concoct such a plan in the first place.</p>
      <p>But concoct they did, because police are currently searching for thieves who did exactly that – with £1 million worth of adult goods going missing from a lorry parked in a lay-by.</p>

      <p>The sex toys were stolen from the vehicle as it was parked overnight on the A43 near Broughton, Northamptonshire, on September 18.</p>
      <p>Police investigating the saucy crime believe the theft took place sometime between 1am and 6.30am, with those responsible breaking into the trailer and swiping all of its imported stock in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>The lorry had been travelling from Felixstowe in Suffolk to deliver its load to Rocks Off Ltd, which is based at the aptly named Satisfaction House in Kettering.</p>
