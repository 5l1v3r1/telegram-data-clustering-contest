        <b>A man who doused eight police officers with a watering can full of petrol and left them fearing for their lives has been jailed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Justin Jackson, 28, doused the officers in the flammable liquid during disorder in Basildon, Essex on 5 May.</p>
      <p>One officer said that he remembered thinking at the time "we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles".</p>
      <p>Jackson, of Ward Close, was jailed for three years and nine months at Basildon Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He had admitted eight counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to cause injury at an earlier hearing.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Joe Bird told the court that disorder had broken out as police tried to arrest a youth riding a stolen motorbike and people interfered with attempts to arrest him.</p>
      <p>During this disorder, Jackson "armed himself with a watering can full of petrol" then "brings it to the scene and sprays officers with it", Mr Bird said.</p>
      <p>Temporary Supt Jonathan Baldwin said: "At the time of the incident while being covered with petrol I remember thinking 'we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles'."</p>
      <p>He added: "It was one of those days I realised I might not have got home at all."</p>
      <p>Alison Gurden, defending, said Jackson had written a letter of apology in which he said: "I'm deeply sorry for what I've done and I can only imagine the fear they felt."</p>

      <p>Judge Samantha Cohen said Jackson did it to prevent them from making arrests.</p>
      <p>She said: "Initially some (of the officers) thought they were splashed with a disfiguring acid or bleach, but when they smelled it was petrol they feared they would be set alight."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jackson's mother Janine Justin, 47, of Ward Close, was given a suspended nine-month prison sentence after being found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.</p>
      <p>The court heard she had threatened police officers with a hammer during the disorder.</p>
      <p>After the sentencing, Supt Baldwin said that "to say that it does not have an effect on us is incorrect".</p>
      <p>"We have had a lot of support from the organisation and colleagues and specialists to help us," he said.</p>
