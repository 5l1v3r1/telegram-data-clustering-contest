07 Nov 2019, 18:11 by 投資
鵬鼎控股（002938）為印刷電路板（PCB）全球龍頭，2019年上半年業績穩健，大行預計第五代流動通訊（5G）技術面世，將會掀起5G換機潮，刺激電路板需求，同時可穿戴電子產品持續錄得增長，預計公司2020年將進入新一輪增長期。

鵬鼎控股全球PCB廠商排名第一
集團是全球PCB廠商排名第一名，市佔率持續上升。數據顯示，2018年全球PCB產業總產值為624億美元。 分析預計，未來5年全球PCB市場將保持溫和增長，預計2018至2023年之間以年均複合增長率3.7%成長，到2023年全球PCB行業產值將達到747.6億美元。 此外，分析預計未來5年內地將繼續主導全球PCB市場的發展，前者增長繼續領先其他國家。
目前集團在全球市佔率約為6%，位列全球第一。大行相信，輕、薄、短、小，為未來技術的主要方向主，而公司的實力為全球頂尖，在產品要求持續上升時，預期市佔率可以同步提升。 SLP技術取勝 大行指出，類載板（SLP）技術會是未來主要的升級方向，因走線密度高，令使用面積減少，以騰出空間給更大的電池和更多的鏡頭。蘋果4G手機、三星5G手機已經開始使用SLP技術，未來國產品牌亦有望採用相關技術。 由於SLP面積更小，會帶動鏡頭、天線、無線充電、按鍵、充電接口等功能組件，使用液晶聚合物（LCP）和軟性印刷電路板（FPC），拉動整個電路板行業需要。公司擁有先進的SLP和FPC技術，同時是蘋果SLP和FPC主力供應商，加上相關技術，目前正在向內地手機品牌普及。



SLP主板的價格是次一級高密度板（HDI）兩倍，大行預計5G手機換機潮中，公司可望受惠於行業升級帶來的利潤。 2019年上半年公司總營業收入93.39億元人民幣，按年下降1.5%，歸屬於母公司所有者淨利潤為6.09億元人民幣，按年增長41.6%，毛利率19.95%，按年升2.26個百分點。 單看第二季，總營業收入51.02億元人民幣，按年增長11.37%，純利4.24億元人民幣，按年增長68.88%。 大行指出，毛利率提升主要是公司消費電子業務拓展，以及工廠自動化效率提升，帶動公司盈利能力增長。

分部業務看，消費電子及電腦領域產品收入錄得較高增長。通訊用板（手機）產品收入則錄得下跌。 大行指出，上半年由於貿易戰因素，以及宏觀環境不利影響，公司手機類產品收入有所下滑，通訊用板（手機）板塊上半年收入63.7億元人民幣，按年下跌15.2%，毛利率19.07%，按年增長1.91個百分點。在收入下跌的情況下，毛利率繼續提升，大行認為這表示公司的自動化生產，及成本管理奏效有關。 消費電子及電腦用板方面，公司收入29.62億元人民幣，增長51.05%，毛利21.81%，增長2.17個百分點，大行認為這意味著公司積極開拓手表等可穿戴領域，獲得良好成果，拉動收入增長。
蘋果新一代機型iPhone 11系列發布，公司從今年第二季開始，就積極為新機出貨部署，大行預計第三季，收入按年、按季均會錄得改善。 同時受蘋果新機型天線改版的影響，集團的軟板單機平均售價有望增長5%至10%左右。
秦皇島半加成製程（mSAP）工廠產能增長順利，大行指其自動化水平，和良率均為行業絕對領先，拉動SLP收入比例穩步提升。 另一方面，Apple Watch和Airpods出貨增長強勁，公司亦積極調整產品結構適應市場，消費電子板塊收入增長迅速，毛利結構改善明顯。 隨著5G周期開始，集團產品有望進入量價齊升時代。大行指蘋果明年正式推出5G手機，換機潮刺激手機零件平均售價上升，其中包括更多的FPC和SLP應用，公司有望於2020年進入新的成長周期。



可穿戴設備亦有望受5G時代拉動加速增長，同時推動軟板及 SLP需求增長。 大行相信，隨日系廠商逐漸退出軟板領域，公司的軟板的市場分額有望進一步提升，伴隨公司自動化產線的改造，公司盈利能力有望逐季加強。 鵬鼎控股股價9月初開始進入上升通道，現價處通頂部創一年新高，可待股價回至42元人民幣水平時買入，目標價看50元人民幣。

5G change the tide demand! A share Pengding Holdings has earned
07 Nov 2019, 18:11 by Investment
Peng Ding Holdings (002938) is the global leader in printed circuit boards (PCBs). Its performance in the first half of 2019 is stable. The Bank expects that the fifth generation of mobile communication (5G) technology will be launched, which will set off a 5G exchange and stimulate circuit board demand. At the same time, wearable electronic products continue to record growth, and the company is expected to enter a new round of growth in 2020.

Pengding Holdings ranked first in the global PCB manufacturers
The Group is ranked first in the global PCB manufacturers, and its market share continues to rise. The data shows that the total output value of the global PCB industry in 2018 is 62.4 billion US dollars. The analysis predicts that the global PCB market will maintain moderate growth in the next five years. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% between 2018 and 2023. By 2023, the global PCB industry will reach US$74.76 billion. In addition, the analysis predicts that the mainland will continue to dominate the development of the global PCB market in the next five years, and the former continues to lead other countries.
At present, the Group's global market share is about 6%, ranking first in the world. Daxing believes that light, thin, short and small are the main directions for future technology, and the company's strength is the world's top. When product requirements continue to rise, the market share is expected to increase simultaneously. SLP technology wins ABC pointed out that the class-board (SLP) technology will be the main upgrade direction in the future. Because of the high density of the traces, the use area is reduced to make room for larger batteries and more lenses. Apple's 4G mobile phones and Samsung 5G mobile phones have begun to use SLP technology, and future domestic brands are also expected to adopt related technologies. Due to the smaller SLP area, it will drive the lens, antenna, wireless charging, buttons, charging interface and other functional components, using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and flexible printed circuit board (FPC), pulling the entire circuit board industry needs. The company has advanced SLP and FPC technology, and is the main supplier of Apple SLP and FPC, plus related technologies, is currently popularizing mobile phone brands in the Mainland.



The price of the SLP motherboard is twice that of the next-level high-density board (HDI). The company expects the 5G mobile phone to change the tide, and the company is expected to benefit from the profits brought by the industry upgrade. In the first half of 2019, the company's total operating income was 9.339 billion yuan, down 1.5% year-on-year. The net profit attributable to owners of the parent company was 609 million yuan, up 41.6% year-on-year, with a gross profit margin of 19.95%, up 2.26 percentage points year-on-year. . Looking at the second quarter alone, the total operating income was 5.102 billion yuan, up 11.37% year-on-year, and the net profit was 424 million yuan, up 68.88% year-on-year. Dahang pointed out that the increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the expansion of the company's consumer electronics business and the improvement of factory automation efficiency, which led to the growth of the company's profitability.

In terms of segment business, revenues from products in the consumer electronics and computer sectors recorded higher growth. Revenue from communications board (mobile phone) products recorded a decline. Daxing pointed out that due to trade war factors and adverse effects of the macro environment, the company's mobile phone products revenue declined. The communications board (mobile phone) segment recorded revenue of 6.37 billion yuan in the first half of the year, down 15.2% year-on-year, with a gross margin of 19.07. %, an increase of 1.91 percentage points year-on-year. In the case of falling income, the gross profit margin continued to rise. The Bank believes that this means that the company's automated production and cost management are related. In terms of consumer electronics and computer boards, the company's revenue was 2.962 billion yuan, an increase of 51.05%, and the gross profit was 21.81%, an increase of 2.17 percentage points. The Bank believes that this means that the company actively develops wearable fields such as watches and achieves good results and stimulates revenue growth. .
Apple's next-generation iPhone 11 series was released. Since the second quarter of this year, the company has been actively deploying new machines. The Bank expects that the third quarter will see an improvement in revenue on a yearly and quarterly basis. At the same time, affected by the revision of Apple's new aircraft antenna, the average price of the Group's soft board single machine is expected to increase by 5% to 10%.
The production capacity of the Qinhuangdao semi-additive process (mSAP) plant has grown smoothly. The big line refers to its automation level, and the yield is the absolute leading position in the industry, which drives the SLP income ratio to increase steadily. On the other hand, shipments of Apple Watch and Airpods grew strongly. The company also actively adjusted its product mix to adapt to the market. The revenue of the consumer electronics sector grew rapidly and the gross profit structure improved significantly. With the beginning of the 5G cycle, the Group's products are expected to enter the era of rising volume and price. The big line said that Apple will officially launch 5G mobile phones next year. The change of the machine will stimulate the average selling price of mobile phone parts, including more FPC and SLP applications. The company is expected to enter a new growth cycle in 2020.



Wearable devices are also expected to accelerate growth in the 5G era, while driving demand for soft boards and SLPs. Daxing believes that with the gradual withdrawal of Japanese manufacturers from the soft board sector, the market share of the company's soft boards is expected to increase further. With the transformation of the company's automated production lines, the company's profitability is expected to strengthen quarter by quarter. Pengding's share price began to enter the rising channel at the beginning of September. The current price reached a new high for the year. It can be bought when the stock price returns to 42 yuan, and the target price is 50 yuan.
