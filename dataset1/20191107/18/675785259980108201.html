      <h2>Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, and Man City counterpart Pep Guardiola go head-to-head in a mouthwatering top-of-the-table clash at Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:13:26+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp attempted to defuse a potential war of words with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , admitting that he shouldn't have accused Pep Guardiola's side of "tactical fouls".</p>
      <p>Klopp's Reds and Guardiola's reigning champions go head-to-head in a mouthwatering top-of-the-table clash at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the showdown, Guardiola fanned the flames last weekend with comments that labelled <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker Sadio Mane as a diver.</p>
      <p>Klopp responded by referencing tactical fouling, a ploy City have been accused of in the past.</p>
      <p>And now, after Guardiola admitted he was wrong to suggest Mane regularly goes down too easily, Klopp held his hands up too.</p>

      <p>"If I could do it again, I wouldn’t say it again, [the tactical fouls comments]," Klopp told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"It’s just not necessary, these kind of things. I know there is a lot of respect there.</p>
      <p>"I feel that’s how it should be. I feel all the rest will be decided on the pitch."</p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Guardiola reneged on his original remarks on Mane, admitting he was wrong with his remarks.</p>
      <p>Klopp accepts the Spaniard's explanation and hailed the Etihad chief as the best manager in the world.</p>
      <p>"He explained it well, he said he discussed it at home," he added.</p>
      <p>"I’m completely fine with that. I couldn’t have more respect for Pep Guardiola. I've known him for so long. It’s a big thing to be his contender.</p>

      <p>"For me, he is the best manager in the world. We have the chance to win against his team, which is enough for me. We’ve had a few good results against them.</p>
      <p>"On my side, there is nothing but respect for him. I said what I said. Okay, you cannot leave it completely without a comment, but actually, I’m not interested.</p>
      <p>"These kind of things…I think there’s enough to write about before the game, purely football."</p>
