      <p>It's been an incredible year for Dave and one that's well-deserved. The U.K. bred rapper released his debut album <i>Psychodrama</i> which earned him the Mercury Prize award in the U.K. On top of that, he starred in <i>Top Boy</i> as Modie and contributed two songs to the soundtrack. As we approach the end of the year, he's back with a brand new drop that teeters closer towards U.K. drill than we've ever heard him before.</p>
      <p>The anticipation surrounding his latest drop, "Paper Cuts" is real. For months, fans have eagerly awaited for its release since a clip of it surfaced online. It's a certified banger that finds Dave flexing his lyrical prowess as he usually does over a haunting drill instrumental. It's another side of Dave that we've only heard in bits.</p>
