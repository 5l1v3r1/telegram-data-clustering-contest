      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An ad was spotted recently showing the Pixel 4 and 4 XL will be discounted by $200 through December 2 on the Google Store.</li>
        <li>The sale is not currently live, but we can expect it to start sometime near Black Friday on November 22.</li>
        <li>It could also be live across all retailers that carry the Pixel 4 phone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It looks like Google is proving yet again that it pays to wait to pick up the latest Pixel phone. Recently, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dsy8jg/pixel_4_bfcm_price_leaked_via_google_ad_200_off/">Redditor</a> spotted an ad for the Google Store online that revealed the Pixel 4 and 4 XL will be $200 off until December 2.</p>
      <p>It doesn't mention when the sale will start, but seeing how it runs through Cyber Monday, we can assume it will start on November 22 for Black Friday. However, with stores starting <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Black Friday sales</a> earlier and earlier each year, it's still quite possible we could see this promotion start even sooner.</p>

      </p>
      <p>At the moment, the Pixel 4 base model will run you $799, but with a $200 discount, you're looking at a much more reasonable $599 price tag. The Pixel 4 XL, on the other hand, starts at $899 regularly but will drop down to $699 once the sale begins.</p>
      <p>That beats out last year's Pixel 3 deals where Google only offered $150 off the Pixel 3 models. Even so, it still doesn't match the leaked <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/targets-black-friday-ad-doesnt-disappoint-19-smart-speakers-huge-gaming-bundles-and-more">Target ad</a> which is offering a $300 gift card with purchase of the Pixel 4. Then there's also been at least one <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82111YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fblack-friday%252Fcell-phone-ad%252Fpcmcat1568908277830.c%253Fid%253Dpcmcat1568908277830&amp;token=sJgcQeyM">mention</a> of Best Buy offering the same $200 off deal for the Pixel 4 phones, meaning it could be seen across all retailers that carry them.</p>
      <p>One thing's for sure though, if you've waited this long, it's certainly worth waiting a couple more weeks for these deals to go live before picking up your new shiny Pixel 4.</p>
