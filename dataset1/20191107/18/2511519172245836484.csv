A book about the efforts of environmental activist Greta Thunberg has been shortlisted for a Blue Peter prize.
The teenage climate activist is among the collected tales of inspirational children gathered in Rise Up: Ordinary Kids With Extraordinary Stories, which was written by Amanda Li. 
It is among the shortlisted titles for the 2020 Blue Peter Book Awards in the “best book with facts” category.
Li commented: “I’m over the moon that Rise Up is on the shortlist for the Blue Peter Book Award. I grew up with Blue Peter and never missed an episode. I loved writing this book as it gave me the chance to find out all about the lives of some amazing young people. 
“All of them are working in their own ways, big and small, feel empowered and fire your imagination.”
Thunberg has attracted a number of high-profile supporters in the entertainment world, most recently from Arnold Schwarzenegger, Patti Smith and Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Other shortlisted titles for the 2020 awards include books about astronauts, stories of magical guilds, student elections, and a lonely young boy. 
The winner will be announced on 5 March 2020 on CBBC.
