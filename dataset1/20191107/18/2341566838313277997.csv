幼兒園2歲班太少 教部加碼13億增設

（中央社記者陳至中台北7日電）台灣2歲幼兒進入幼兒園的比率僅23%，低於OECD國家平均值許多。教育部長潘文忠今天宣布5年加碼新台幣13億元，鼓勵各縣市增設幼兒園2歲專班，預計到民國113年增加800班。
總統蔡英文今天宣布2到3歲托育補助將無縫接軌，續留公共托育、準公共保母、準公共托嬰中心，也可以繼續領取托育補助。
衛生福利部長陳時中解釋，原先是希望2歲以後銜接幼兒園，但目前台灣2歲班的量還不足夠，各縣市分布也不均勻。政府考量整體政策是要減輕家長負擔，讓轉銜之際、正在幫孩子尋找幼兒園的家長，也能獲得足夠的支持，才提出延長托育補助的政策。
對此，教育部長潘文忠表示，目前台灣2歲幼兒入園率是23%，OECD國家平均是33%，還有一大段落差。推估原因，幼兒園2歲班（幼幼班）的成本較高，師生比要求是1比8，相比之下3歲以上班的師生比要求是1比15，業者設置意願較低。
潘文忠表示，為了提升2歲幼兒入園率，教育部109年到113年將投入13.55億元，鼓勵各縣市增設2歲專班。具體作法是要求所有新建的公共化幼兒園，都要設置2歲班；現有幼兒園中，設置2歲班可獲得150萬元全額補助。准公共化幼兒園部分，每新增一班2歲班，將提供30萬元獎勵金。
增設2歲班需要大量幼教師，潘文忠表示，近年已有越來越多大學擴增幼教名額，教育部之所以規劃5年逐步擴增，就是考量了師資的準備。
潘文忠表示，預計113年全台幼兒園將增加800個2歲班，增加1.2萬個招生名額，2歲入園率將可達到OECD國家平均的33%水準。（編輯：葉俐緯）1081107

Kindergarten 2 years old class too small Ministry of Education plus 1.3 billion additional
07 Nov 2019, 18:06 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Chen Zhizhong, Taipei, 7th) The ratio of Taiwanese 2-year-old children entering kindergarten is only 23%, which is lower than the average of OECD countries. Education Minister Pan Wenzhong announced today that it will increase NT$1.3 billion in five years. It encourages counties and cities to set up a 2-year-old class for kindergartens. It is estimated that 800 classes will be added in the Republic of China in 113 years.
President Tsai Ing-wen announced today that the 2 to 3 year old childcare subsidy will be seamlessly integrated, and the public care, quasi-public babysitter, and quasi-public nursery center will be renewed.
Chen Shizhong, Minister of Health and Welfare, explained that it was originally hoped that the kindergarten would be connected after the age of two, but the current number of classes in Taiwan is not enough, and the distribution of counties and cities is uneven. The Government's overall policy is to reduce the burden on parents. Parents who are helping children to find kindergartens at the time of transfer can also obtain sufficient support before they propose a policy to extend the subsidy for childcare.
In this regard, Education Minister Pan Wenzhong said that the current rate of admission for 2-year-old children in Taiwan is 23%, and that in OECD countries is 33%. There is still a big gap. The reason for the estimation is that the cost of the 2-year-old class (young class) is higher, and the teacher-student ratio is 1 to 8, compared with the teacher-student ratio of 3 to 15 years, the requirement is 1 to 15. .
Pan Wenzhong said that in order to increase the admission rate of 2-year-old children, the Ministry of Education will invest 1.355 billion yuan from 109 to 113, encouraging the county and city to set up a 2-year special class. The specific method is to require all newly-built public kindergartens to set up a 2-year-old class; in the existing kindergartens, a 2-year-old class can receive a full subsidy of 1.5 million yuan. In the quasi-publicized kindergarten section, each additional class of 2 years old will provide 300,000 yuan in rewards.
The addition of a 2-year-old class requires a large number of young teachers. Pan Wenzhong said that in recent years, more and more universities have expanded the number of kindergartens. The reason why the Ministry of Education plans to gradually expand for five years is to consider the preparation of teachers.
Pan Wenzhong said that it is estimated that the number of kindergartens in Taiwan will increase by 800 two-year-old classes in 113 years, and the number of enrollment quotas will increase by 12,000. The 2-year admission rate will reach the average of 33% in OECD countries. (Editor: Ye Weiwei) 1081107
