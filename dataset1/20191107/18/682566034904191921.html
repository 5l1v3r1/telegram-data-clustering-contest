      <p>Lisbon - Lokomotiv Moscow forward<b> Eder</b>, whose goal won <b>Portugal </b>Euro 2016, earned a recall to his country's squad Thursday for their upcoming qualifiers for next summer's finals against Lithuania and Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old returns as part of a 25-man squad named by coach Fernando Santos as Portugal attempt to lock down a place at Euro 2020 over the final two qualifying rounds.</p>
      <p>They host Lithuania, the bottom side in Group B, in the Algarve on November 14 before making the trip to Luxembourg three days later.</p>
      <p>Eder's last appearance for his country came almost a year ago but he is included after a strong start to the season in Russia, where he has scored four times in nine league games.</p>
      <p>Portugal are without Andre Gomes who suffered a horrific leg injury playing for Everton at the weekend, while teenage star Joao Felix and Goncalo Guedes are also sidelined.</p>
      <p>Uncapped forward Diogo Jota is one of four Wolves players selected by the UEFA Nations League winners.</p>
      <p>Portugal are second in their group but just one point ahead of Serbia following a 2-1 loss to leaders Ukraine in Kiev last month.</p>
