      <p>Bill Gates and Elizabeth Warren are tweeting at each other — and it seems possible they could have an IRL conversation soon.</p>
      <p>But let’s first back up to <i>why</i> they’re @-ing each other. Yesterday, the Microsoft co-founder was interviewed at <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>’ DealBook Conference. The very first thing CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Gates was his position on Warren’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/elizabeth-warren-would-double-billionaire-wealth-tax-for-medicare-for-all-plan.html">proposed 6 percent wealth tax</a> on billionaires, which is designed to help pay for Medicare for All.</p>
      <p>As part of his response, he discusses how a wealth tax could affect him, and if he’s ever met with Elizabeth Warren:</p>

      <p>His comment about paying over $10 billion in taxes can only be described as a tax flex (he seemed to be joking, but maybe not really). And he didn’t seem confident that Warren would want to sit down with him.</p>
      <p>Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/_15DReQKbt8?t=300">video of his comments</a>, with the tweeted quotes coming in just after the six-minute mark:</p>

      <p>Well, last night Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1192237965113790466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1192237965113790466&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">tweeted to say</a> that, actually, she’d be happy to discuss her wealth tax further with Gates:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And this morning, Gates <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1192462488895275010">tweeted back</a> — though he doesn’t exactly agree to meet up. But he at least sounds interested in having some kind of conversation with Warren to discuss how to fight wealth inequality:</p>

      <p>So, it doesn’t seem as if the Elizabeth Warren Bill Gates Wealth Inequality Beer Summit Extravaganza will be happening imminently — but perhaps the two will talk soon. Since they’re already chatting on Twitter, maybe they’ll just keep tweeting back and forth, because that’s a thing a Democratic candidate and one of the richest men in the world will do in 2019.</p>
