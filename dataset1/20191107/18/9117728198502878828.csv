Toro Rosso expect to struggle until at least 2023
07 Nov 2019, 18:14 by Tom Mason

Toro Rosso manager Franz Tost has said that he doesn't think the team will be competing anywhere near the podiums until 2023. The team are seventh in the drivers' standing with two races remaining and are just one point below the team above them, Racing Point.

Neither driver were in the points at the United States Grand Prix, Daniil Kvyat finishing in 12th, while Pierre Gasly ended up in 16th.



 ""I do not expect a success in 2021. Budget cuts will come into effect in 2021, which means that the best teams [have to reduce] their development costs. The others will come next, I hope, but I do not expect that before 2023, "" As quoted by F1 only.
""In 2021, the teams will use the developments made in 2019 and 2020 and will only be able to use what is indicated in the budget limit, which will significantly reduce the possibilities of progression until 2022.""



 To highlight just how big a gap there is between the top three teams and the rest, there is 245 points between Aston Martin Red Bull Racing in 3rd and McLaren in 4th.
