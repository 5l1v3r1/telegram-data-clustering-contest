      <p>MOSCOW:Â Russia's sports minister insisted Thursday that data handed to the World Anti-Doping Agency was not doctored, while WADA has asked Moscow to explain "inconsistencies."</p>
      <p>"Nothing was removed there, our experts insist this didn't happen," sports minister Pavel Kolobkov said, Interfax news agency reported.</p>

      <p>The electronic data handed to WADA investigators early this year came from RUSADA's former Moscow anti-doping laboratory. in September, WADA asked Russia to respond to "inconsistencies" in the data.</p>
      <p>"These are technical questions, they are linked to the system," Kolobkov insisted, according to TASS news agency.</p>
      <p>"At a meeting shortly between specialists from Russia and WADA these questions may be cleared up.</p>
      <p>"We are doing all we can to fulfil the obligations that we committed to last September and we fulfilled them," Kolobkov added.</p>
      <p>He said the current controversy had nothing to do with athletes preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>"Such questions only make our athletes, trainers and federations nervous," he said.</p>
      <p>The current head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Yuri Ganus, has denied that his team had any involvement in falsifying data but has said that he believes there was manipulation.</p>
      <p>In an interview with AFP last month, Ganus said he expected Russia to be banned from the Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics over the doctored data.</p>
      <p>He blamed unnamed Russian officials for manipulating the data handed over to WADA.</p>
      <p>Kolobkov denied those claims, saying: "There was not any manipulation as the head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Yuri Ganus, has said. That's our position."</p>
      <p>He said Russia had already selected more than 100 athletes to take part in the Tokyo Olympics next year and he expected a final total of around 400 to take part.</p>
      <p>"We can expect good results from the Olympics," he said.</p>
      <p>WADA is currently holding its world conference in the Polish city of Katowice and the scandal over Russian state-backed doping and institutionalised cheating has dominated the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the conference on Wednesday, Ganus blasted the "irresponsible and destructive actions" of Russian authorities and blamed the falsification of the data from the laboratory on "forces outside RUSADA."</p>
