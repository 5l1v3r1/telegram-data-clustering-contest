        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): India and the US have been embroiled in a series of trade spats, both bilaterally and at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) since the middle of last year, but this hasn’t stopped them from looking at other viable options.</b>

      <p>India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal is likely to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/piyush-goyal-to-visit-us-for-trade-talks-next-week/articleshow/71945259.cms?utm_source=ETMyNews&amp;utm_medium=HPMN&amp;utm_campaign=AL1&amp;utm_content=20">undertake a visit to the US</a> on 11 and 12 November presumably to conduct talks on a more significant bilateral trade deal moving forward, reports The Economic Times.</p>
      <p>The proposed visit is being viewed as significant following New Delhi's decision to opt-out of the 15-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement earlier this week due to its key concerns not being addressed.</p>
      <p>Next week's trip to the US will be Goyal's second in the last two months. He had earlier visited Washington and New York in September for bilateral trade talks.</p>
      <p>India and the US have trade differences on <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910221077115985-indian-ruling-party-affiliate-asks-federal-govt-to-cancel-licenses-of-e-commerce-giants-/">providing greater market access for American agricultural items</a>, price controls on essential medical devices (cardiac stents, drug-eluting stents, condoms and intra-uterine appliances) and high import duties on goods like American whisky and Harley Davidson motorcycles.</p>
      <p>During Goyal's visit, the Indian delegation is likely to ask the US to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201909251076887940-us-india-trade-deal-falling-through-not-a-good-sign-analysts/">restore the over three-decades-old Generalised System of Preferences or GSP</a> (a preferential tariff system for developing countries) which it withdrew in the first week of June this year, the Indian daily quoted sources as saying.</p>
      <p>The US had terminated the GSP on the grounds that India was not providing "equitable and reasonable access to its markets".</p>
      <p>Negotiations for an expanded trade deal will include tariff elimination on information and communications technology (ICT) goods and data-related relaxations.</p>
      <p>India is also keen on <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077191849-us-wins-challenge-to-india-export-subsidies-at-wto-trade-representative-office/">safeguarding the interests of the country's farming community</a> and keeping religious sensitivities in mind while importing products with animal-based feed into their food chain.</p>
      <p>Trade talks with the US Trade Representative's (USTR's) office have been ongoing, and both sides are quite optimistic about arriving at a mutually beneficial pact during Minister Goyal's visits to Washington and New York next week.</p>
      <p>Bilateral trade between India and the US currently stands at about $150 billion. According to government data available in the public domain, there has been a 10 per cent annual increase. In fiscal 2018-19, Indian exports to the US were an estimated $52.4 billion. Imports from the US to India were pegged at $35.5 billion.</p>
