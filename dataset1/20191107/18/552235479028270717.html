      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-defiantly-don-colours-20832346">Celtic</a> fan has gone on trial accused of punching three police horses during the worst riot an officer claimed he has ever seen.</p>
      <p>Kevin McGuire, 36, denies “causing unnecessary suffering” to Nerston, Oban and Glasgow on January this year before the Hoops played Airdrie in the fourth round of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a> at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Mark Stewart told Glasgow Sheriff Court: “When I got there, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/airdrie">Airdrie</a> fans were being blocked from getting into the ground by Celtic fans.</p>
      <p>“There were families trying to get in and there were bricks and missiles getting flung as well as spitting and throwing lit cigarettes.</p>
      <p>“They were very aggressive and this was the worst riot I had ever seen.”</p>
      <p>The officer claimed McGuire was "directing others" during the alleged incident and said he saw him attack three police horses outside the ground.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: “I asked him to move and he punched my horse Oban on the nozzle which caused him to react.</p>
      <p>“It was a full blown punch and he also punched police horse Glasgow on the face.”</p>
      <p>Sgt Stewart claimed another police horse named Nerston was also punched later on.</p>
      <p>He stated he was hit on the leg by McGuire as was another officer, while PC Mark Garner claimed to have witnessed the attacks.</p>
      <p>But PC Garner was unable to identify himself or McGuire when CCTV was shown to the court.</p>
      <p>He claimed to have arrested McGuire after the incident and put him into a police van with two sets of handcuffs locked behind his back.</p>
      <p>But he claimed McGuire moved them to the front using a “party trick.”</p>
      <p>Lawyer, Michael McKeown, defending, asked how it was possible.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>PC Garner replied: “I’m not a contortionist and don’t know how it was done.”</p>
      <p>PC Garner took McGuire to nearby London Road police office where he was said to be “compliant but aggressive.”</p>
      <p>McGuire, from Cardonald, Glasgow, is also charged with two assaults to police officers and acting in a threatening and abusive manner.</p>
      <p>He denies the charges.</p>
      <p>The trial continues before Sheriff John McCormick.</p>
