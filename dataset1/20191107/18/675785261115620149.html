      <h2>Tyson Fury is keen to appear in a WWE ring again - and he has threatened to knock out Brock Lesnar in devastating fashion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:10:21+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has threatened to hit Brock Lesnar so hard he will "wake up in Tokyo" as he called out the superstar for a Wrestlemania showdown.</p>
      <p>Lineal heavyweight boxing champion Fury knocked out Braun Strowman on his first in-ring WWE appearance at the Crown Jewel pay-per-view last week.</p>
      <p>But it appears it will not be his only WWE appearance, with the Gypsy King already confirmed to appear on Friday Night Smackdown in hometown Manchester this week.</p>
      <p>Lesnar has not made the trip as part of WWE's European tour having initially been tipped to be Fury's first opponent.</p>
      <p>But the giant boxer has not given up hopes of taking on the ex-UFC star as he revealed his desire to knock him out at Wrestlemania 36.</p>

      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1483233538">Corey Graves' After the Bell</a> podcast, Fury said: “Hopefully you see me in the ring again.</p>
      <p>“I want to fight Brock Lesnar next.</p>
      <p>"One clip from the Gypsy King and he’ll wake up in Tokyo.”</p>
      <p>He declared his desire to make the fight happen on the biggest stage at Wrestlemania.</p>
      <p>Fury could also follow in Lesnar's footsteps by appearing in both WWE and UFC.</p>

      <p>The Gypsy King has declared his desire to take over combat sports and teased an MMA switch, training with British star Darren Till as he eyes a transition.</p>
      <p>In a clip posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Thursday, Fury said: "Good news everybody, I'm going to go training with Darren Till this weekend.</p>

      <p>"We're going to smash it and he's going to get me started on my MMA career. Get in there my boy."</p>
      <p>But he is due for a huge rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in February 2020, with his heavyweight rival claiming he is running scared of a second clash.</p>
      <p>An angry Fury responded by saying: "The thing is with you Wilder, crack on with your own business and I'll see you February 22 to finish what I started. This time you're going to get smashed you big bum dosser."</p>
