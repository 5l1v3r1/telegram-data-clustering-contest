      <p>Pixar has made a bit of history by featuring Filipino CGI animated characters for the first time in a new film.<br/><br/>"Float" is a film about acceptance. In it, a father discovered his adorable son is unlike other kids. The film followed their trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>Pixar writer/producer Bobby Rubio talked to us about his project.<br/><br/><b>RELATED: <a href="https://abc7.com/disney+-what-to-know-price-release-date-shows/5244792/">Disney+: What to know about price, release date, shows and more!</a></b><br/><br/>"It's based on my own personal story of my son," he explained. "In the story, the father is dealing with a son that floats, which makes him different from other children."<br/><br/>"Float" was seen as a chance to celebrate children with unique gifts.<br/><br/>Rubio said he took a feature-based approach to make the characters Filipino American. The father has darker skin and a flatter nose.<br/><br/>"I know we don't all look alike, but at the same time, I wanted traits that I had so that it at least felt authentic," he said.<br/><br/>The characters are animated versions of himself and his son. Rubio has long looked for ways to introduce his culture to a broader audience, and Pixar offered that opportunity.<br/><br/><b>RELATED: <a href="https://abc7.com/disney-lists-basically-everything-you-can-watch-on-disney-plus/5608593/">What movies, shows can you watch on Disney+?
