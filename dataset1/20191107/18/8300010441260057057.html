      <p>25 miles south of the Las Vegas strip, lies the Rise Festival, a music and lantern festival in the middle of a dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert. It's a stark contrast to the traffic and blaring lights of Vegas. Thousands gather here for a three-day festival of music, food and a simultaneous release of more than 10,000 lanterns into the desert sky.<br/><br/>"There's an experience and emotion at Rise that doesn't exist anywhere I have ever found" says Rise co-founder Dan Hill. Many come to Rise to celebrate new beginnings and to remember the life of loved ones that have passed on.<br/><br/>Join us as we take you on a behind the scenes look at one of the most magical events you've never been to!<br/><br/>For more info on Rise and their future events, <a href="https://risefestival.com/">click here</a>.</p>
