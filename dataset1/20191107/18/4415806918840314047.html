      <p>The abandoned house where Ana Kriegel was murdered last year should be demolished, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.</p>
      <p>The Taoiseach's comments come after two 15-year-old boys convicted of Ana’s murder in Lucan, Co Dublin, in May 2018 were sentenced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Boy A, who was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault, was sentenced at the Central Criminal Court to life, with a review period after 12 years.</p>
      <p>Boy B was sentenced to 15 years’ detention, with a review after eight years.</p>
      <p>Ana Kriegel’s body was found last year in Glenwood House, a derelict 19th-century farmhouse, located in Lucan in west Dublin.</p>

      <p>Ana's blood was found on the walls and the floor of the room where she died when her body was discovered last May.</p>
      <p>Local councillors in West Dublin have called for the house to be removed from the protected structures list and to be demolished following the sentencing on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Dublin today, Mr Varadkar said he agreed that it should be demolished.</p>
      <p>“It’s very hard to pass that building without thinking about what happened there.</p>
      <p>“It’s not, in my view, a building of enormous architectural heritage and I would like to see the designation lifted by the council and to have that building demolished.”</p>
      <p>Glenwood House has a protected structure status and is privately owned by the O’Callaghan family who own a hotel chain.</p>
      <p>The two-storey mansion was designed by architect James Gandon, who also designed former Taoiseach Charles Haughey’s home, Abbeyville in Kinsealy, north Dublin.</p>
