      <p>Sam Woodring, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1986136/two-inch-astronaut-announce-indefinite-hiatus/news/">formerly of</a> Two Inch Astronaut, is releasing his debut full-length as Mister Goblin, <i>Is Path Warm?</i>, at the end of the month. We’ve heard one track from it so far, the Sadie Dupuis-featuring “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062185/mister-goblin-calendar-dogs-feat-sadie-dupuis/music/">Calendar Dogs</a>,” and today he’s back with another one, “Fix Your Face.”</p>
      <p>It’s a downbeat wallow that contains some ace horror references. “Still I always get struck on the same old things and then history repeats like <i>Friday The 13th</i>/ Every sequel the same and I die at the end/ Except for a few,” Woodring sings, and then: “…I lose the whole plot like in <i>Halloween III</i>/ When they took Mike away and we just didn’t know how lonely it’d be.” (<i>Season Of The Witch</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBaxLR13pyE">is fun</a>, though.) Turns out the diminishing returns of slasher sequels make an apt analogy for the diminishing returns of life.</p>
