""Currently, Yeung’s passport has been impounded while he is assisting the police with ongoing investigations.""
""He is, however, neither arrested nor in police custody, and is free to go about his activities within Singapore,"" the authorities said. 
The Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong has been embroiled in anti-government unrest for several months, after what started as rallies against a now-dead extradition Bill erupted into a wider movement calling for greater freedoms and police accountability.

Mr Yeung said in a YouTube video posted on Monday he had planned to stay in Singapore from Oct 10 to Oct 12 to seek business opportunities.
""I have never thought of breaking any laws in Singapore … I have never been in politics,"" said the founder of the Wah Kee chain of restaurants, who has drawn the ire of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong for his pro-China views.
""The police would like to remind the public that organising or participating in a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is illegal and constitutes an offences under the Public Order Act,"" said the Singapore authorities. 
""The police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries. Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore should abide by our laws,"" they added.
