      <h1>Liam Payne hints at painful cause of Cheryl split as he admits his part in breakup</h1>
      <h2>Liam Payne and Cheryl split just over a year after the birth of their son Bear, and Liam says the problems were his.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:19:11+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>It's been 16 months since Liam Payne and Cheryl Cole split, and in that time no specific reason has ever been given.</p>
      <p>But now Liam has held his hands up and revealed what went wrong between the pair after the birth of their son Bear in March 2017.</p>
      <p>Having dreamed of being a dad from the age of 16, Liam - who was 23 when Bear arrived - said one of the first problems arose when the pressure of fatherhood knocked him for six.</p>
      <p>"Becoming a dad at such a young age, it's such a difficult thing," he says in his new documentary, Ant Middleton and Liam Payne: Straight Talking.</p>

      <p>"And I think I built fatherhood up so much in my head that it kind of messed me up to start with. I started in a bad place with it," he contiued.</p>
      <p>"I think it spooked me out early on, and I was just worried I would not be enough to look after the both of them. They're so important to me â€” Cheryl as well."</p>
      <p>The second issue, he says according to heat magazine, was that he didn't "understand" what Cheryl, 36, was going through as a new mum.</p>

      <p>"The one thing I was missing as a man in the relationship I had, was a level understanding about what she was feeling about stuff," he admitted.</p>
      <p>"I think I learnt through away being that, while I want to protect her, there's a big part of her that wants to protect me."</p>
      <p>Liam, 26, is now dating Texan model Maya Henry, 19, but says Cheryl remains the number one person in his life.</p>
      <p>"She's one of the most, if not the most, important people in my life. I'm lucky I have someone who understands what I'm going through," he added.</p>

      <p>And he also joked they could get back together if Cheryl "plays her cards right."</p>
      <p>Like Liam, Cheryl found fame as a teenager on a reality show and was just 19 when she won a place in Girls Aloud on Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
      <p>She first met Liam in 2008 when he was a 14-year-old hopeful on The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> and she was a judge. Their paths crossed again in 2015 when he returned to perform with One Direction and the rest is history.</p>

      <p>Cheryl has credited Liam with being the only man not to have cheated on her, and previously opened up about her side of the story.</p>
      <p>Revealing how after One Direction split, Liam just wanted to "settle down and have a family," she told the Times she encouraged Liam to pursue a solo career, "and then it didn't work out."</p>
      <p>Asked if Liam changed his mind about wanting domestic bliss, she responded, "You'll have to ask him that."</p>
      <p>But she admitted he struggled switching his head from pop star to father as his career took off.</p>
      <p>Like Liam, she harbours no ill will and describes their existing relationship as "healthy".</p>
      <p>"There's no animosity whatsoever. We are learning all the time. We're just like any other couple that have gone through this, but we have a few more eyes watching us... Just a few," she added.</p>
