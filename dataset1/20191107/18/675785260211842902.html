      <p>A teenage boy was stabbed to death in west London this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It is the latest murder involving a blade to strike the capital which is in the grip of a knife crime epidemic.</p>
      <p>Met Police officers were called to reports of a stabbing on the High Street in Uxbridge at 4.40pm today.</p>
      <p>They found a boy who had been knifed in the chest and he was rushed to hospital.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead at 5.25pm and a murder investigation has been launched.</p>
      <p>A second boy also suffered a knife injury to his ear, Scotland Yard said in a statement. His injuries are not life threatening.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made and police remain at the scene this evening.</p>
      <p>The stabbing comes the day two teenagers were found guilty of murdering Girl Scout Jodie Chesney in east London in March in a murder which caused national outrage over London's knife crime epidemic.</p>
      <p>The local force has authorised a Section 60 order to be in place until 8.37am tomorrow.</p>
      <p>It gives police the power to stop and search anyone in a prescribed area without probable cause.</p>
      <p>Enquiries are underway to notify next of kin of the teenage boy whose exact age has not been released by police.</p>
