      <h1>Warren would 'love to explain' how much Bill Gates would pay under her wealth tax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:04:38+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Allan Smith </a></address>
      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she'd be "happy" to meet with Microsoft founder Bill Gates to discuss her policy plan after the billionaire joked that her wealth tax might cost him $100 billion.</p>
      <p>"I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views," the 2020 presidential candidate <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1192237965113790466">tweeted</a> Wednesday evening. "<a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates">@BillGates</a>, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.)"</p>
      <p>Warren has proposed a 6 percent <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elizabeth-warren-s-plan-tax-super-rich-has-been-tried-n963971">wealth tax</a> on assets above $1 billion to help fund "Medicare for All." The wealth tax proposal has come under <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-tells-bill-gates-shell-explain-her-wealth-tax-to-him/">criticism</a> from billionaires like financier Leon Cooperman and JP Morgan Chase's Jamie Dimon.</p>
      <p>"Yes, billionaires will have to pay a little more, but they will still likely pay less than what they would earn just from putting their assets into an index fund and doing nothing," Warren <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/ending-the-stranglehold-of-health-care-costs-on-american-families-bf8286b13086">wrote</a> in her plan released Friday. Warren has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/elizabeth-warren-would-double-billionaire-wealth-tax-for-medicare-for-all-plan.html">also</a> proposed a series of other taxes aimed at the wealthiest Americans.</p>
      <p>Speaking at The New York Times' DealBook conference on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/watch-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-speak-at-dealbook-conference.html">Gates said</a> he's "paid over $10 billion in taxes."</p>
      <p>"I've paid more than anyone in taxes," he continued. "If I had to pay $20 billion, it's fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, okay, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over. I'm just kidding."</p>
      <p>Gates added that he was unsure whether Warren would meet with a billionaire to discuss policy.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure how open-minded she is — or that she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money," Gates said.</p>
      <p>Gates declined to say who he would vote for in a hypothetical matchup between Warren and President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to make political declarations," Gates said. "But I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind, a professional approach is even, as much as I disagree with some of the policy things that are out there, I do think a professional approach to the office is… whoever I decide will have the more professional approach in the current situation probably is the thing that I will weigh the most. And I hope that the more professional candidate is an electable candidate."</p>
      <p>Gates is worth an estimated $109 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/william-h-gates/">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
