      <p>If you're in the Houston-area this fall, take a drive along I-10 and experience Dewberry Farm in Brookshire, Texas! <br/><br/>What started as a research property in the 2000s has turned into a little slice of country paradise with games, rides, trains, food, gifts and more!<br/><br/>Mary Emerson and her husband Larry own the farm.<br/><br/>"So much of society has gone now to indoor activities with their iPads and iPhones," Emerson said, "To be out in the open is something that all children should experience."<br/><br/>And, if you visit before Thanksgiving, you'll get an opportunity to pick your own pumpkin, weave your way through an authentic corn maze and take pictures in front of a variety of fall-themed backgrounds and decorations!</p>
