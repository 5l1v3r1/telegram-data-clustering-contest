      <h1>Don Trump Jr. rips ABC on The View for hypocrisy over firing their own whistleblower</h1>

      <p>Donald Trump Jr. went on ABC's <i>The View</i> to defend his father, President Trump, and promote his new book <i>Triggered.</i></p>
      <p>The hosts attacked him Thursday for publishing the name of the whistleblower, and Trump Jr. said he released it because it was already out on the Drudge Report and other news sites. He said the media was hypocritical for criticizing him because ABC had gotten their own whistleblower fired Thursday.</p>
      <p>The son of the president blasted the network for criticizing him while getting CBS to fire the person who leaked video from a host saying they spiked the Jeffrey Epstein story three years ago.</p>
      <p>Trump Jr. said he does not regret releasing the name of the whistleblower.</p>
