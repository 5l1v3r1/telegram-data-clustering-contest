      <h2>Which song will win?</h2>

      <p>We have a strong feeling we already know which song will end up winning this bracket. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/drake-track-bracket-round-3-is-live-right-now-news.95047.html">At the beginning of the week, we launched the official HNHH Drake Track Bracket, asking his most loyal fans to choose their picks for his best track of all time</a>. Obviously, it's pretty difficult to single out one cut from his extensive discography for that title. He's got so many songs that are worthy of that prize. However, we've got to come to a conclusion and tomorrow, we will finally have your pick for the top spot. The semi-finals round is officially live and only four Drizzy tunes remain.</p>

      <p>After an intense third round, a few of our favorites have been bounced from the tournament. "HYFR" and "Started From The Bottom" are no longer in the running after getting kicked out of the competition and now, we're left to choose between four songs: "Marvin's Room," "Know Yourself," "Best I Ever Had", and "Headlines." It's up to you to determine which song walks away with the top prize.</p>
