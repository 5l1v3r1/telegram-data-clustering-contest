      <p>A 13-year-old boy, who was hit with a brick on Guy Fawkes Day, has been taken off life support and his family is now hoping that he recovers fully.</p>
      <p>The boy, whose name is known to News24, had been playing in a street in Heinz Park, Cape Town, on Tuesday when a man came out of a yard and threw a brick at him, hitting him in the head, his mother said.</p>

      <p>"They took him off life support and he has a heart machine. He is still in a coma," she said after visiting him at Groote Schuur Hospital.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy because I have to work and put bread on the table. Through God, I will survive."</p>
      <p>Heinz Park Football Club coach Quinton Abrahams said the teen had opened his eyes and asked for water on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"Maybe he will not be the same but I know he is going to make it."</p>
      <p>Abrahams said he had sent a message to his players to tell them to stay away from Guy Fawkes activities.</p>
      <p>"[I believe that] the reason for him being hit was that the guy wanted to scare them off because I am sure nobody would want to injure or kill a boy. They were just smearing one another with paint."</p>
      <p>He said the teen was a disciplined soccer player and had a lot of promise.</p>
      <p>"He started carrying water for the older players when he was around six years old and started playing for the junior team a few years later.</p>
      <p>"Coaches in the different divisions noticed he was one of the boys who had real talent. This year, he started playing for the under-14 side. Now, the under-16 coach wants him to play for that team," said Abrahams.</p>
      <p>The boy's sister previously told News24 they could not believe what had happened as he had a bright future ahead.</p>
      <p>The family is in the process of opening a case with the police.</p>
