        <b>It is hoped the sale of a 52 percent stake in France's national lottery 'Francaise des Jeux' will bring in 2 billion euros for the French government. FDJ is the fourth-largest betting company in the world.</b>
      </p>
      <p>France's state-owned lottery 'La Française des Jeux' (FDJ) started its transition to the private sector on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The state will retain a 20 percent stake in the company, and will benefit from a yearly public contribution of some €3.5 billion.</p>
      <p>The indicative price for shares in the operator have been set between €16.50 and €19.90, which would value the company at up to €3.8 billion.</p>
      <p>A third of the shares have been reserved for individual investors, who are being offered a two percent discount.</p>
      <p>FDJ's scratchcards and lotteries are played by millions, and the sale could help jump-start the reform drive after it was knocked off track by the 'Yellow Vest" protest movement.</p>
      <p>The privatisation is part of President Emmanuel Macron's broader reforms to re-vitalise the French economy and make it more welcoming for foreign investors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>High stakes for France's economy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that the sale was a "chance for the French to diversify their holdings at a time when interest rates are low."</p>

      <p>"The funds obtained would open the door to new development prospects," he added.</p>
      <p>The government hopes the sale will rekindle demand for stocks among French savers, many of whom have stuck massively with ultra safe but low-interest savings accounts since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>To further entice individual investors, they will be given a free share for every 10 bought if they hold them for at least 18 months.</p>
      <p>The subscription period runs to 20 November, and trading will begin the next day</p>
      <p>
        <b>Selling off the family jewels?</b>
      </p>
      <p>FDJ came into being as the successor of a national lottery founded in 1933 to help soldiers disfigured in World War I and struggling farmers.</p>
      <p>Today, it is the second-biggest betting company in Europe and the fourth in the world.</p>
      <p>Consequently, critics and opposition parties have assailed the move to offload a rare money-making state enterprise, saying it is tantamount to selling off "the family jewels".</p>
      <p>Le Maire rejected the claims Thursday, saying "FDJ is part of our national heritage."</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's government has vowed to partially privatise a number of entities, including the airports operator ADP and the energy behemoth Engie, to feed a 10 billion euro fund to kickstart technological innovation.</p>
