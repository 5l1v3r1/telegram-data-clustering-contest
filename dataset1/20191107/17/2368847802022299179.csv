中共低頭接受華府條件 同意分階段取消關稅

07 Nov 2019, 17:12

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】週四（11月7日），中共商務部發言人高峰表示，在過去的兩周中，中美雙方已同意隨協議進展分階段取消已加征關稅。《美國之音》稱，這是北京對華盛頓做出的重要妥協。
高峰在當天臨時通知舉行的商務部新聞發布會上宣布了上述消息。他還強調了中方在該問題上的立場：如果中美雙方達成第一階段協議，應當根據協議的內容同步等比率取消已加征關稅，這是達成協議的「重要條件」。
高峰並表示，根據第一階段協議內容商定取消多少關稅，「有利於穩定市場預期，有利於中美兩國經濟和世界經濟」。
但他隨後強調：「中方對關稅問題的立場是一貫明確的，貿易戰由加征關稅而起，也應由取消加征關稅而止。」
《美國之音》報導，中方此前一直堅持如果達成協議，美方必須全部取消已加徵關稅。高峰的說法顯示，北京現在似乎在這個問題上做出了妥協。美方一貫堅持，鑒於中共長期以來不遵守承諾的歷史記錄，美方必須視中方執行協議的情況分階段取消關稅，以防北京故伎重演。
上月的美中貿易談判後，川普宣布達成「第一階段原則性協議」。當時中方承諾每年購買400億到500億美元美國農產品，並公布了明年開放部分金融市場的時間表。但是後續消息顯示，中方開始將採購額度縮水，並提出其它附加條件，包括取消部分關稅。
英媒報導，中方提出第一階段協議達成後，美方取消12月15日加徵關稅的計劃，並撤銷9月1日已加徵的關稅。但迄今美方仍未做出最後決定。
雙方原定11月中旬在智利的APEC峰會上簽訂協議，但目前進展並不順利。不但智利取消了舉辦APEC峰會，美中敲定協議文本的高階談判仍未提上日程。日前美國貿易代表辦公室宣布，繼續副部級談判以解決剩餘的「突出議題」。多方消息指，11月可能已經無法簽署協議，最早也要推遲到12月。
對於在何處簽署協議，雙方似乎仍然爭執不下。中共商務部發言人在週四的記者會上表示，關於簽署協議的地點，目前仍「沒有具體信息可以透露」。
此前一個多月，中方一直在向美國釋放達成協議的「誠意」。有分析認為，這可能是為了中共「十一」和四中全會的「穩定」。四中剛一落幕，中共官方和官媒就轉向強硬，重申「核心利益」不妥協、取消關稅是達成協議的「必要條件」云云。

The CCP bowed its head to accept Washington’s conditions and agreed to phase out tariffs.

07 Nov 2019, 17:12

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] On Thursday (November 7), the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China said that in the past two weeks, China and the United States have agreed to cancel the phased increase with the progress of the agreement. tariff. ""Voice of America"" said that this is an important compromise made by Beijing to Washington.
The peak announced the above news at the press conference of the Ministry of Commerce, which was temporarily notified on the same day. He also emphasized China's position on this issue: If China and the United States reach the first phase agreement, they should cancel the tariffs according to the content of the agreement at the same time. This is an ""important condition"" for reaching an agreement.
Gao Feng also said that according to the content of the first phase agreement, it is agreed to cancel the tariffs. ""It is conducive to stabilizing market expectations and benefiting the economies of the two countries and the world economy.""
However, he later stressed: ""China's position on the tariff issue has always been clear. The trade war should start with the addition of tariffs, and it should be stopped by the elimination of tariffs.""
""Voice of America"" reported that the Chinese had previously insisted that if an agreement was reached, the US must cancel all the tariffs already imposed. The peak said that Beijing now seems to have compromised on this issue. The United States has consistently adhered to the fact that in view of the long history of the CCP’s failure to comply with its commitments, the United States must abolish tariffs in stages, depending on China’s implementation of the agreement, in order to prevent the recurrence of Beijing’s old sayings.
After the US-China trade talks last month, Trump announced the conclusion of the ""first phase of the principled agreement."" At that time, China promised to buy 40 to 50 billion US dollars of US agricultural products every year, and announced the timetable for opening some financial markets next year. However, follow-up news showed that China began to shrink the purchase quota and proposed other additional conditions, including the cancellation of some tariffs.
The British media reported that after the Chinese side proposed the first phase of the agreement, the US canceled the plan to impose tariffs on December 15 and revoked the tariffs imposed on September 1. But so far the US has not made a final decision.
The two sides originally scheduled an agreement at the APEC summit in Chile in mid-November, but the progress is not smooth. Not only did Chile cancel the APEC summit, but the high-level negotiations between the US and China to finalize the agreement were still not on the agenda. Recently, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced that it will continue the deputy ministerial level negotiations to resolve the remaining ""prominent issues."" Multi-party news means that the agreement may not be signed in November, and it will be postponed until December at the earliest.
The parties seem to be still arguing about where to sign the agreement. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference on Thursday that there is still no specific information on the location of the agreement.
More than a month before, China has been releasing the ""sincerity"" of reaching an agreement to the United States. Some analysts believe that this may be for the ""seven"" of the CCP and the ""stability"" of the Fourth Plenary Session. As soon as the Fourth China was over, the official and official media of the Chinese Communist Party turned to be tough, reaffirming that the ""core interests"" were not compromised and that the elimination of tariffs was the ""necessary condition"" for reaching an agreement.
