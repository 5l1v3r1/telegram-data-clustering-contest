      <p>BEIJING: Beijing on Thursday (Nov 7) criticised as "fictitious" a report by British politicians claiming there was "alarming evidence" of Chinese interference on university campuses.</p>
      <p>The report, which was released Tuesday, cited examples where Beijing-linked organisations appeared to suppress freedom of speech at institutions of higher education.</p>

      <p>One academic told lawmakers he saw Confucius Institute officials confiscating papers which mentioned Taiwan - which Beijing considers a rebel province awaiting reunification - at an academic conference.</p>
      <p>Likened to France's Alliance Francaise, Spain's Instituto Cervantes and the British Council, the Confucius Institute teaches students about Chinese language and culture at hundreds of universities around the world.</p>
      <p>Christopher Hughes, a professor at the London School of Economics, said he had seen Chinese students in the British capital engaged in activities to "undermine Hong Kong protestors".</p>
      <p>"China has always adhered to a principle of non-interference in internal affairs," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a press briefing.</p>
      <p>The UK lawmakers should "do more to ... advance China-UK relations, instead of making fictitious remarks and sowing discord," Geng added.</p>

      <p>The report comes as pro-democracy demonstrations in semi-autonomous Hong Kong have sparked tensions across universities in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, as students organise rallies both in support of - and against - the protest movement.</p>
      <p>In Australia, public rallies and acts of solidarity have been staged at several campuses, angering some mainland Chinese students who have physically confronted protestors and torn down message boards.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government does not appear to have tried to quiet the tensions, with consulates in Auckland and Brisbane praising the "spontaneous patriotism" of pro-Beijing students.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been convulsed by five months of huge and increasingly violent protests calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability - representing the biggest challenge to Beijing's rule since the city was handed back to Britain in 1997.</p>
      <p>In July, Australian education minister Dan Tehan said the government was looking at whether deals between thirteen local universities and the Confucius Institute breached foreign interference laws.</p>
      <p>It came after the Sydney Morning Herald published 11 of the 13 contracts between the Confucius Institute and Australian universities.</p>
      <p>Four contracts featured clauses giving the organisation final say on "teaching quality" and stated activities must respect "cultural custom".</p>
      <p>In return, the universities received minimum funding of A$100,000-A$150,000 and 3,000 Chinese books and other materials.</p>
