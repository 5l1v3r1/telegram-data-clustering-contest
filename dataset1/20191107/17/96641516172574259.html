      <h1>Kanye West's sustainable Yeezy concept uses algae foam</h1>
      <h2>Theyâ€™re basically khaki crocs for hypebeasts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:55:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>The next sneaker in Kanye West's Yeezy line could be made from algae foam. West <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90428095/kanye-just-unveiled-a-new-foam-sneaker-made-from-algae">offered a glimpse</a> of the shoe at <i>Fast Company</i>'s Innovation Festival today. He also shared that Yeezy is planning to move its headquarters to a 4,000-acre ranch in Wyoming, where it will grow its own algae in a hydroponic farm.</p>
      <p>Creating more sustainable sneakers is great, but these might have a hard time winning people over. The pair West showed today look an awful lot like the original Crocs -- they're modeled after the <a href="https://solecollector.com/news/2019/09/adidas-yeezy-foam-runner-release-date">Yeezy Foam Runner</a>. West says the company is experimenting with alternatives to harmful dyes, but in the meantime, the sneakers are painfully khaki.</p>
      <p>It's not entirely surprising that Yeezy is developing sustainable footwear. It is an Adidas brand, after all, and Adidas has been experimenting with eco-friendly designs for years. In 2016, it made a sneaker out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/04/adidas-ultraboost-uncaged-parley/">ocean plastic</a>. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/17/adidas-futurecraft-loop-recycled-running-shoes-sustainability-speedfactory/">Futurecraft Loop</a> is a running shoe that's fully recyclable, and it has pledged to use only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/16/adidas-will-only-use-recycled-plastics-by-2024/">recycled plastics by 2024</a>.</p>
      <p>West didn't say when the algae-derived Yeezy kicks will be available or how long it will take to get the hydroponic farm up and running.</p>
