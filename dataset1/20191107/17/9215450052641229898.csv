A股真升浪要等2020年！牛熊線預告未升完 ｜傅允軒

A50指數在今年2月25日錄得突破性上升之後，八個月來一直在高位橫行，當日留下的「上升裂口」，幾度為市場帶來支持。雖然A股先後在3月、5月和8月顯著回吐，但都守於該「上升裂口」之上。

A股顯著轉強
隨著A股顯著轉強，A50指數的250天線也重拾升勢，現在已升至比上述裂口還要高的水平，成為市場另一道防線。整體上，最近數月A股一直徘徊於去年貿易戰開打時的相近水平，種種跡象表明，A股並沒有對表面上的利淡消息有任何利淡的反應。
跟短期走勢不同的，牛熊線乃反映長期趨向的一個指標，而這個指標本身，亦有自己的趨向。由於牛熊線代表的，是長線投資者的取態，不似短線投機者的飄忽多變，所以牛熊線的趨向一般較易捉摸。以A股為例，一旦牛熊線由跌轉升，其趨勢往往能夠維持一段日子。例如2016年11月，A股牛熊線開始回升，其升浪足足維持了一整年。
A股牛熊線預告未升完
所以說，今次A股牛熊線的升勢在7月份剛剛開始，至今才四個月左右，可以合理地預期，將有下一波升浪跟尾。現在的情況，大概跟2017年4月有點相似。A股強勢，連帶跟A股相關度較高的中國平安（02318）亦受到追捧，年初至今平保上升了超過30%，升幅大概是同期恒生指數的10倍。其實平保強勢已非甚麼新鮮事，那怕是在港股勁升的2017年，恒指全年升幅達36%，但平保的升勢亦遠超恒指。
筆者關心的，反而是這麼一隻強勢股，在短期跑輸大市的時候該怎麼做，說的就是現在。港股在10月11日見底回升，同日平保大升2.7%，翌日恒指跟平保再衝一段，但就在10月14日開始，平保便突然跑輸大市，持續至今。歷史上平保跑輸恒指的情況並不常見，而這些日子往往構成吸納平保的機會，重點是這種跑輸大市的情況會持續多久。

平保跑輸情況罕見
如果想知道較為具體的情況，可以將平保股價除以恒生指數來看，將會得出一個數值。數值愈大，代表平保跑贏恒指；相反在數字下降時，就是平保跑輸大市的日子，到底平保這幾年有幾勁，便可以一眼認清。當中有幾段平保明顯跑輸大市的日子，分別是2008年金融海嘯、2011年歐債危機、2013年內地錢荒，以及2015年人民幣貶值。
由於恒指成分股中有相對穩健的股份存在，這些日子持有波動較強的平保當然較傷，但如果是長線持有，卻是沒有大礙。除了因為大環境淡勢而令平保跑輸大市的非常時期外，平保亦有間歇性跑輸大市的日子，但這些日子一般較為短暫，最長為時約兩個半月。
以往績推論，如果在10月14日開始跑輸大市計起，兩個半月後即第四季結束之前，將會是吸納平保的好機會。由此引伸推測A股的真正升浪，可能會在明年第一季開始。免責聲明：本專頁刊載的所有投資分析技巧，只可作參考用途。市場瞬息萬變，讀者在作出投資決定前理應審慎，並主動掌握市場最新狀況。若不幸招致任何損失，概與本刊及相關作者無關。而本集團旗下網站或社交平台的網誌內容及觀點，僅屬筆者個人意見，與新傳媒立場無關。本集團旗下網站對因上述人士張貼之資訊內容所帶來之損失或損害概不負責。

A shares are really rising and waiting for 2020! Bulls and bears line notice has not been upgraded | Fu Yunxuan
07 Nov 2019, 17:46 by Investment
After the breakthrough in the A50 index on February 25 this year, it has been at a high level for eight months. The ""rising gap"" left on that day has brought support to the market several times. Although the A shares have retreated significantly in March, May and August, they all adhered to the ""rising gap"".

A shares significantly strengthened
As the A-shares strengthened significantly, the 250 antenna of the A50 index also regained its upward momentum. Now it has risen to a level higher than the above-mentioned gap and become another line of defense in the market. Overall, A-shares have been at a similar level in the last few months of the trade war in recent months, and there are indications that A-shares have not had any negative reaction to the apparently bad news.
Unlike the short-term trend, the bull-bear line is an indicator of long-term trends, and the indicator itself has its own trend. Because the bull-bear line represents the attitude of long-term investors, unlike the short-term speculators, the trend of the bull-bear line is generally more elusive. Take A-shares as an example. Once the bull-bear line rises from a falling point, the trend tends to last for some time. For example, in November 2016, the A-share bull-bear line began to rise, and its rising tide was maintained for a whole year.
A-share bull-bear line notice has not been upgraded
Therefore, the uptrend of the A-share bull-bear line has just started in July, and it has only been about four months since then. It can be reasonably expected that there will be the next wave of rising and falling. The current situation is probably similar to April 2017. A-shares are strong, and Ping An (02318), which has a high correlation with A-shares, has also been sought after. The year-to-date level has risen by more than 30%, which is about 10 times that of the Hang Seng Index. In fact, the strength of Ping An is nothing new. Even in 2017, the Hang Seng Index rose 36% in the year, but the rise in Ping An far exceeded that of the HSI.
What the author cares about is a strong stock, what to do when it loses the market in the short term, and it is now. Hong Kong stocks bottomed out on October 11th. On the same day, Ping An surged 2.7%. On the same day, Hang Seng Index and Pingbao re-rushed for a while, but on October 14th, Ping An suddenly underperformed the market and continued to this day. Historically, it has been uncommon for Ping An to underperform the HSI, and these days often constitute an opportunity to absorb Ping An, with a focus on how long this situation will run out of the market.

Pingbao’s underrun is rare
If you want to know more specific circumstances, you can divide the Ping An stock price by the Hang Seng Index and you will get a value. The larger the value, the better the Pingheng wins the HSI; on the contrary, when the number drops, it is the day when the Pingbao underperforms the market. In the end, the Pingbao has a few strengths in the past few years, so you can recognize it at a glance. Among them, there were several days when Ping An clearly underperformed the market, namely the 2008 financial tsunami, the 2011 European debt crisis, the inland money shortage in 2013, and the RMB depreciation in 2015.
As there are relatively stable stocks in the HSI constituent stocks, it is certainly more serious to hold the volatility of Ping An in these days, but if it is held in the long-term, it is not a big problem. In addition to the extraordinary period in which Ping An underperformed the market due to the weak environment, Ping An also had intermittently underperformed the market, but these days were generally short-lived, and the longest period was about two and a half months.
In the past, if you start to underperform the big market on October 14, it will be a good opportunity to absorb the insurance before the end of the fourth quarter after two and a half months. This extension speculates that the real rise of A shares may start in the first quarter of next year. Disclaimer: All investment analysis techniques published on this page are for reference only.
