通脹退休理財法
諗Sir：
本人48歲，算是高管，年薪156萬元，但位置不穩；太太47歲，文職，年薪42萬元。資產方面如下：

青衣三房自住樓，市值1,600萬元，欠450萬元，月供20,000元；
青衣三房父母自住樓，市值1,200萬元，欠380萬元，月供15,000元；
青衣兩房收租樓A，市值900萬元，欠120萬元，收租18,000元，月供10,000元；
青衣兩房收租樓B，市值900萬元，欠260萬元，收租19,000元，月供10,500元；
馬灣珀麗灣兩房收租樓，市值700萬元，欠260萬，收租16,000元，月供10,500元；

本人正開始計劃退休，希望穩陣行先，本屬意債基，但諗sir講過「債基只屬1至5年投資物」，如何部署應付30年通脹？

投資物業需穩定現金流
投資物業需穩定的現金流，好區份要有高成交量，令業主隨時可將物業賣走套錢；同時可減少空租期及谷高樓價，然而青衣不屬此類。青衣沒向上換樓階梯，一旦客人認為盈翠四房都唔夠照，就要搬走，等於留唔到大客的生意，想盤數做大難上加難。
排除自住樓，讀者手上投資的物業現金流產出效率如下：

青衣兩房A為1.2%（（1.8—1）×12÷（900—120））；
青衣兩房B為1.54%（（1.9—1.05）×12÷（900—260））；
珀麗灣兩房1.5%（（1.6—1.05）×12÷（700—260）；
灣仔商業樓2.74%（1.5—0.7）×12÷（500—150））；
上環商業樓1.7%（2.3—1.3）×12÷（1,000—300））。

債基只屬1至5年投資物
筆者確實有講過「債基只屬1至5年投資物」，要應付30年通脹貶走銀紙購買力之險，就要買樓。珀麗灣客路不夠闊，可以賣走；其實讀者全部投資物的現金流都不合格。由於經濟放緩會持續一陣，上環及灣仔商業樓以及車位應首先賣走，套回約1,200萬元（500—150＋1,000—300＋150）。賣後兩間青衣收租樓連同兩間自住物業，樓房淨值達3,430萬元（1,150＋820＋800＋660）。
1,200萬元重心買直債，選取保誠6.5厘息及渣打7厘年息的，投入780萬元，收平均6.5厘，一年產出65,000美元收入，即平均一個月收42,000元。當然，780萬元買債可順便開埋私人銀行戶口，做直債槓桿時降低借貸成本。餘下420萬元投入債基，分三注買入，主打美國國債為主，15厘息每年派63萬元，即月月有52,000元收入。那1,200萬元投入，每股收94,000元利息，夠讀者人工支出。一年後作好上述安排，到時返工與否已不重要。

Inflation retirement financing law
谂Sir:
I am 48 years old, I am an executive, with an annual salary of 1.56 million yuan, but the position is not stable; my wife is 47 years old, civilian, with an annual salary of 420,000 yuan. The assets are as follows:

Tsing Yi three-bedroom self-occupied building with a market value of 16 million yuan, owing 4.5 million yuan and a monthly payment of 20,000 yuan;
Tsing Yi three-bedroom parents live on their own, with a market value of 12 million yuan, owing 3.8 million yuan, and a monthly payment of 15,000 yuan;
Tsing Yi two-room rental building A, with a market value of 9 million yuan, owing 1.2 million yuan, collecting 18,000 yuan, and providing 10,000 yuan a month;
Tsing Yi two-room rental building B, with a market value of 9 million yuan, owing 2.6 million yuan, renting 19,000 yuan, monthly supply of 10,500 yuan;
Two-bedroom rental housing in Ma Wan Park Island, with a market value of 7 million yuan, owing 2.6 million yuan, renting 16,000 yuan, and monthly payment of 10,500 yuan;
Wanchai 480 sq ft commercial building with a market value of 5 million yuan, owing 1.5 million yuan, renting 15,000 yuan, and monthly payment of 7,000 yuan;
930 sq. ft. commercial building in Sheung Wan, with a market value of 10 million yuan, owing 3 million yuan, renting 23,000 yuan, and monthly payment of 13,000 yuan;
Tsing Yi's own parking space, with a market value of 2.5 million yuan, no mortgage;
There are two parking spaces in Haojing Garden, with a market value of 1.5 million yuan and a monthly rent of 3,500 yuan. There is no mortgage;
Each of Zhongshan, Zhuhai and Jiangmen Building has a market value of 4.5 million yuan and Jiangmen Building has a monthly fee of 10,000 yuan.
Cash is about 10 million yuan and stocks are about 10 million yuan.

I am planning to retire. I hope that the situation will be stable. This is the basis of debt. But sir said that ""the debt base is only one to five years of investment."" How to deploy 30 years of inflation?

Investment property needs stable cash flow
Investment properties require stable cash flow, and high-volume volume in good districts allows owners to sell their properties at any time. At the same time, it can reduce the air-rent period and the high property prices. However, Tsing Yi does not belong to this category. Tsing Yi did not change the stairs upstairs. Once the guests think that Ying Cui four rooms are enough to take photos, they have to move away, which is equivalent to staying in the business of big customers, and it is more difficult to make the number of disks difficult.
Excluding self-occupied buildings, the cash flow output efficiency of the property invested by readers is as follows:

Tsing Yi two rooms A is 1.2% ((1.8-1) × 12 ÷ (900-120));
The two rooms B in Tsing Yi are 1.54% ((1.9-1.05)×12÷(900-260));
Two rooms in Rosedale Bay 1.5% ((1.6-1.05)×12÷ (700-260);
2.74% (1.5-0.7) × 12÷ (500-150)) of Wanchai Commercial Building;
Sheung Wan Commercial Building 1.7% (2.3-1.3) × 12 ÷ (1,000-300)).

The debt base is only one to five years of investment
The author has indeed said that ""the debt base is only one to five years of investment."" To cope with the 30-year inflation and the risk of purchasing silver paper, it is necessary to buy a flat. The Park Road in Park Island is not wide enough to sell; in fact, the cash flow of all the readers' investment is unqualified. As the economic slowdown will continue for a while, the commercial buildings and parking spaces in Sheung Wan and Wan Chai should be sold first and set back for about $12 million (500-150+1,000-300+150). After the sale of the two Tsing Yi rental buildings together with two self-occupied properties, the net worth of the building reached 34.3 million yuan (1,150+820+800+660).
The 12 million yuan focus on direct debt, the choice of Prudential 6.5 cents and Standard Chartered 7 percent annual interest, invested 7.8 million yuan, an average of 6.5 percent, a year of output of 65,000 US dollars, that is, an average of 42,000 yuan a month. Of course, 7.8 million yuan of debt can be used to bury private bank accounts, and reduce borrowing costs when making direct debt leverage. The remaining 4.2 million yuan will be invested in the debt base, and will be bought in three bets. The main focus is on US Treasury bonds. The 15% interest rate is 630,000 yuan per year, that is, the monthly income is 52,000 yuan. That 12 million yuan investment, 94,000 yuan per share interest, enough for readers to spend. After the above arrangements are made one year later, it is not important to rework or not.
