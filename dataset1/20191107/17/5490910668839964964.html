      <p>Endeavor is putting yet another company under its umbrella and bringing in a new president of its influential representation and management businesses.</p>
      <p>The entertainment conglomerate, just a few weeks after pulling its IPO, said it’s taken a majority stake in Whalerock Industries, a media consulting company founded by Lloyd Braun. With the investment, the value of which was not disclosed, Endeavor said it’s now a “strategic operating partner” of Whalerock and that Braun will become the head of its various management businesses, including WME, <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/img/">IMG</a> (including the <a href="https://wwd.com/eye/people/candace-bushnell-is-there-still-sex-in-the-city-1203356688/">IMG</a> licensing business), The Wall Group, Art + Commerce and Lens.</p>
      <p>Mark Shapiro, <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/media/mark-shapiro-named-president-of-endeavor-1202929818/">president of Endeavor</a>, pointed to Braun’s “innate ability to identify and grow successful businesses for individuals and brands” and his history of executive roles within a variety of media companies. Before founding Whalerock in 2007, he led Yahoo Media after a few years as chairman of ABC Entertainment and a prior stint as president of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment.</p>
      <p>“In this new role, Lloyd will be charged with harnessing our collective resources to elevate our offerings for clients across entertainment, sports and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/fashion/">fashion</a>,” Shapiro said. “I was lucky enough to work with Lloyd while he was at ABC, where I witnessed firsthand his significant expertise and passion for the creative community.”</p>
      <p>As for Braun, he noted Endeavor’s influence, adding: “Artists and creators have more influence and power than ever before, and I’m excited to be joining Endeavor in a role that will help our clients best capitalize on all the resources available to them across our network.”</p>
      <p>Whalerock will still operate under that name, but also start working within Endeavor’s operation of 160over90, its in-house creative agency that creates promotions and ad campaigns for brands and clients. Anne-Marie O’Neill, Whalerock’s chief operating officer, will take over Braun’s role as chief executive officer.</p>
      <p>Shapiro added that Whalerock’s operations in consulting “will serve at the ideal complement to 160over90’s capabilities across advertising, branding, experiential, partnerships, p.r. and communications.”</p>
