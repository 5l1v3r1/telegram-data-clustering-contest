      <p>Universal <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/universal-has-reportedly-given-up-on-its-monsterverse.html">scrapped</a> its expensive yet ill-conceived Dark Universe plans after Tom Cruise’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-mummy-movie-review.html"><i>The Mummy</i></a><i> </i>failed to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-mummy-could-kill-universals-dark-universe-or-save-it.html">make a dent</a>, but the studio’s legacy monsters are still very much alive. Today we got the first trailer for writer and director <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/leigh-whannell-defined-a-decade-of-horror-and-hes-not-done.html">Leigh Whannell</a>’s <i>The Invisible Man</i>, which is being handled by Blumhouse (i.e., made on a far leaner scale than the previously conceived Johnny Depp iteration would have been) before Universal lets it out like a test balloon for a smaller-scale Universal Monsters revival in February. The new take on the classic tale stars <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/elisabeth-moss-handmaids-tale-feminism-and-peak-tv.html">Elisabeth Moss</a> as Cecilia Kass, who begins the movie by escaping her sociopathic abusive boyfriend, Adrian (played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen), and learning shortly after that he’s killed himself and left her a $5 million fortune. The one catch is that she must never be declared mentally unfit if she wants to keep the money, but she can’t shake the feeling that her abusive ex … is still around. Following her, taunting her, threatening her, and exploiting her trauma. Is Adrian alive and terrorizing Cecilia, or is this all in her head? You probably know the answer to that question, but the movie opens February 28 if you want to make sure.</p>
