      <h1>Margaret Atwood: Greta Thunberg Is the 'Joan of Arc of the Environment'</h1>
      <h2>Margaret Atwood has declared Greta Thunberg the ‘Joan of Arc of the environment.’</h2>

      <p>The Canadian novelist, best known for her dystopian feminist fable <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>, was speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly94ci1wb2RjYXN0LnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vcnNzMi54bWw%3D&amp;episode=aHR0cHM6Ly94ci1wb2RjYXN0LnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vZW50cnkvMjAxOS0xMS0wMVQxOF8yNF8zMC0wN18wMA%3D%3D&amp;hl=en-GB">podcast </a>of the environmental extremist action group Extinction Rebellion.</p>
      <p>Atwood said:</p>
      <blockquote>“She’s wonderful and she’s impervious to people slagging her off.”</blockquote>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>“She’s sort of the Joan of Arc of the environment. I think she needs a big white horse.”</blockquote>
      <p>Like Thunberg, Joan of Arc was a visionary teenager who appeared to have supernatural powers. Thunberg – at least according to her mother – can see carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, even though it’s invisible. Joan of Arc, aka the Maid of Orleans, also had visions – of figures she claimed were Saint Michael, Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret, who told her to drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years War.</p>
      <p>Joan of Arc was illiterate.</p>
      <p>Thunberg isn’t illiterate – but she is a 16-year-old school drop out, which almost counts.</p>
      <p>Joan of Arc was burnt at the stake for heresy by the English.</p>
      <p>Thunberg is currently<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2019/11/04/theyre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat-more-climate-activists-cry-for-help-to-reach-cop25-climate-conference/"> stuck</a> in Los Angeles, trying to work out how she can cross the Atlantic to reach the next United Nations climate conference in Madrid, Spain without the use of an aircraft.</p>
