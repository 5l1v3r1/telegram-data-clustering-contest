      <h1>Antonio Brown says, again, he's done with the NFL: 'No more control of my name and body'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/antonio-brown">Antonio Brown</a> said, again, he was finished with the NFL.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post Thursday, the former star wide receiver apparently took issue with the league making money off his name and also hit out at those hoping he would come back to save their fantasy football teams.</p>

      <p>It appeared that Brown was referencing trying to clear his name in regard to the allegations made against him, which ultimately cost him a job with the New England Patriots. He was accused by a former personal trainer of sexual assault and rape in a civil lawsuit and of sexual assault in a separate report.</p>
      <p>Brown has vehemently denied the allegations. He still hasn’t met with the NFL over the allegations, but <a href="https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson/status/1192455512270557184">ESPN</a> reported that the former receiver was going to meet with the league in person next week.</p>
      <p>The wide receiver was traded to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/oakland-raiders">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in March, but never played a down with the Raiders. Brown forced himself out of Oakland and signed with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a>. He played one game before being released again.</p>
      <p>After his exit in New England, Brown said he was done with the NFL but backtracked days later.</p>

      <p>It’s unclear whether teams are interested in signing him despite his representatives’ assertion that there are teams looking to pick him up. The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> reportedly checked in on Brown before ultimately signing Josh Gordon last week.</p>
