      <h1>Tesco apologise to angry Plymouth family over turkey mix-up</h1>
      <h2>The retailer says spot-checks during busy periods - particular at lunchtime - are normal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:14:34+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Miles O'Leary</a></address>
      <p>Tesco has said sorry to a Plymouth family who were made to hand over their receipts after they went shopping to prove they had paid.</p>
      <p>But the retail giant says there was nothing wrong with the way staff conducted themselves on the day Claire Harrison and her loved ones visited the Transit Way supermarket branch.</p>
      <p>Mum of five Claire was left fuming after her husband, auntie and mum <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-familys-humiliating-row-tesco-3508259">were confronted by staff at the self-service tills.</a></p>
      <p>The Sherford mum-of-five claimed cashiers were rude and grabbed hold of her auntie's receipt right out of her handbag and ripped another from her hubby's clutches.</p>
      <p>She has vowed to never step foot inside the busy shop ever again after the episode.</p>
      <p>Claire's mum was also made to hand over a receipt for a Christmas turkey she bought. She initially lost it at first but managed to find it at the bottom of her shopping trolley.</p>
      <p>Tesco said spot-checks are carried out routinely with shoppers - and its actions towards Claire and her family weren't personal.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Plymouth Live, a Tesco spokesperson said: "We are sorry to hear that Ms Harrison and her family were unhappy about their experience in the store.</p>
      <p>"It is very common for our colleagues to carry out spot checks at self-service checkouts, particularly during busy lunch time periods, and we can confirm that the correct procedures were followed."</p>
      <p>Claire told how she felt humiliated by the store's actions on Wednesday, November 6.</p>

      <p>"I have been going there for the last eight years and I will never, ever step foot in there again," she raged.</p>
      <p>"I am a 31-year-old mum with five kids, I ain't no criminal."</p>
      <p>Claire and her loved ones visited Tesco after being appalled with the price of a turkey bird from Morrisons - where they're reportedly going for £30 a pop.</p>
      <p>In the end they snapped up a £20 turkey in Tesco, deciding against the slighter cheaper £16 one because it looked 'dented'.</p>
      <p>"My mum, she paid for her stuff on her bank card and bought a turkey for Christmas separately," Claire explained.</p>
      <p>"They asked her for her receipt and she didn't know what she had done with it.</p>
      <p>"She thought she might have left it in the shopping trolley. She found it and it was yanked out of her hand.</p>
      <p>"There was no apology, nothing."</p>
      <p>Claire says the checkout area was packed full of shoppers - but no-one else was confronted.</p>
      <p>Readers on Plymouth Live's Facebook page said random spot-checks were quite common at Transit Way and in another other supermarket.</p>
      <p>Heather Jones said: "It's pretty standard in any supermarket for staff to stop folk who have gone through self-service tills to be stopped and checked that they paid for everything.</p>
      <p>Markpeter Woodbridge said: "The shop has every right to ask for a receipt, it's nothing personal, if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about, end of."</p>
      <p>Tammy Sawyer said: "Just a random check don't make it more then it is lol."</p>
      <p>Whilst others have jumped to the defence of staff at the store.</p>
      <p>Kate-Louise Power said: "The staff have a job to do I very much doubt they snatched receipts out of hands."</p>
