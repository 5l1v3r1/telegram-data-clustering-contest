      <h1>Stocks hit new highs as China, U.S. said to agree to tariff rollback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:45:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Ballentine and Vildana Hajric</a></address>
      <p>Equities climbed to new highs after reports that China and the U.S. have agreed to roll back tariffs on each other’s goods in phases as they work toward a trade deal. Ten-year Treasury yields hit a 14-week high on their biggest gain since 2016, while gold declined the most in six weeks.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 Index rose to a record Thursday, with tech and financial sectors leading the charge, after a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a rollback agreement would be part of a phase-one agreement. China is also reportedly studying the removal of curbs on U.S. poultry imports.</p>
      <p>Shares advanced in Hong Kong and China’s yuan strengthened offshore, while the Stoxx Europe 600 advanced. West Texas crude futures rose above US$57 a barrel in New York. The pound weakened after two Bank of England policy makers unexpectedly voted for an interest-rate cut. European sovereign bonds declined.</p>

      <p>Risk appetite is picking up as the latest reports of progress on trade helped counter earlier reports that a preliminary accord may not happen this month as the two sides continued to wrangle over a location to sign it. With economic indicators showing signs of stabilization, investors will now be looking for further evidence that a global recession can be avoided.</p>
      <p>“At the very least, we can start to call it less bad to constructive, so it’s positive for the markets in general,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “Obviously, until we get a done deal, there can be volatility around trade headlines. It seems like the U.S.-China trade news now is surprising to the upside, which is a tailwind to the markets.”</p>
