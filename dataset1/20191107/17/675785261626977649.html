      <p>Hollyoaks actor Rory Douglas-Speed has confessed fatherhood is both "amazing" and "terrifying", as he opened up on returning to set for the first time since baby son Reggie was born.</p>
      <p>The new dad, who plays Joel Dexter on the Channel 4 soap, welcomed his adorable baby boy with fiancée Nadine Mulkerrin last month.</p>
      <p>Rory spoke <b>exclusively to Mirror Online</b> and confessed it was "challenging" returning to work with the little one and his mum at home, but said he was finding the whole experience "a whirlwind".</p>
      <p>He explained: "It's crazy, it's like everything anybody ever explained it as or tells you.</p>

      <p>"It's terrifying but so exciting, it's been a whirlwind few weeks and being back here has made it a little bit more difficult and a little bit more challenging, but no it's amazing and we're both loving it."</p>
      <p>On being back to work, he revealed the return of co-star Jamie Lomas, who plays on-screen dad Warren Fox, has been a breath of fresh hair and made his return "a ball".</p>
      <p>The star also admitted taking a nap or two if he has time between filming, getting as much sleep as he can around the couple's sleepless nights.</p>

      <p>He said: "Yeah, I’m a lot more tired than I usually am which I think is a given.</p>
      <p>"It's brilliant cos there's a new energy on set with Jamie coming back and it's been a ball so far.</p>
      <p>"I’m loving it and I don’t tell Nadine this but if I’ve got a couple of hours off in the afternoon, I go for a sleep in the green room!"</p>

      <p>The actor also shared his hopes of exploring a darker side of his character Joel, ahead of his dad's comeback.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think it's different for a character, I’ve played nicey nicey for three years and I've only had one or two scenes where I turn it up a bit and to be honest, I enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"It's challenging playing a villain-esque character because the audience can immediately turn on you, but if you're gifted like Grace Black or like Warren Fox, or Sienna, it can be brilliant for a character and it can give longevity in that if you get it right and play it right it could be excellent. I'd love to get my teeth into that."</p>
