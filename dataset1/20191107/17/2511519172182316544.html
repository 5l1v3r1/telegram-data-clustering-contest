      <p>A city in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Brazil">Brazil</a> is preparing to pay a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/basic-income">basic income</a> to around 50,000 residents in one of the largest trials of such a scheme in the world.</p>
      <p>The policy will see around one-third of the city’s residents being given 130 reais (£25) each per month, without any conditions about how they can spend the money.</p>
      <p>The money is distributed in “Mumbuca” – the city’s local currency which is not accepted in the rest of Brazil.</p>
      <p>“For us, this is a critical public policy issue that is in a constant state of development,” Fabiano Horta, the mayor of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marica">Marica</a>, said.</p>
      <p>“It was created as a social currency to supplement income, and today it has already advanced to become a basic income for Marica’s citizens.</p>
      <p>“We are in a good moment to undertake these studies and understand how the Mumbuca currency is transforming the social context of the city.”</p>
      <p>In the first round of payments, around 27,000 residents will be given the basic income this month, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/marica-brazil-basic-income-policy-monthly-payments-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"><i>Business Insider</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>They will receive the money on a pre-loaded card, or through a mobile phone app. There is no option to receive it in cash.</p>
      <p>To be eligible for the stipend, residents must have lived in the city for at least three years and must earn below a certain amount, pegged at three times Brazil’s monthly salary.</p>
      <p>The scheme will be evaluated by researchers at the Jain Family Institute, a New York-based social research organisation.</p>

      <p>Michael Stynes, CEO of the institute, said: “This is an exceptionally rare and exciting opportunity to study a cash transfer policy at a large scale.</p>
      <p>“We’re thrilled to work with an incredibly innovative government and researchers from UFF [the Universidade Federal Fluminense] who are taking bold steps towards creating a better life for Marica’s citizens.</p>
      <p>“We are united in our belief that this policy, and the evidence it creates, will be a touchstone in discussions of [universal basic income] throughout Brazil and the world.”</p>
      <p>Similar basic income schemes have recently been run in Stockton in California, Ontario in Canada and Finland.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Finnish experiment <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/finland-universal-basic-income-trial-unemployment-experiment-trial-a8769621.html">ended in failure</a> when it did not help the unemployed rejoin the workforce.</p>
      <p>The two-year test saw 2,000 randomly selected citizens who did not have jobs given €560 (£480) a month. </p>
      <p>Researchers found it did not encourage recipients to seek work compared to a control group who did not receive the money, though they did report being happier and healthier.</p>
      <p>A poll conducted last year found <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/universal-basic-income-uk-labour-poverty-benefits-poll-john-mcdonnell-a8474626.html">40 per cent of British people supported the concept of a universal basic income</a> and would welcome experiments in their local area.</p>
