07 Nov 2019, 17:13

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月08日訊】本週四，北京當局接連釋放多個對美國政府示好的信息：由國務院宣布新的政策法規，全面取消外資銀行、券商、基金等金融機構在華業務範圍的限制，並減少外國投資者在華投資設立銀行、保險機構的數量型准入條件；同時宣布海關總署和農業農村部正在研究解除美國禽肉對華出口限制等事宜。分析認為，中方這一系列做法，意在為中美貿易協議簽署營造良好氣氛，顯示雙方當前的貿易談判或有了新的進展。
中共國務院在當地時間11月7日公佈了旨在大幅鬆綁外企在華投資的文件，主要內容包括：全面取消外資銀行、券商、基金等金融機構業務範圍限制，允許外國保險業在中國設公司，2020年取消券商、壽險業的外資持股限制等。
文件中還明文規定，行政機關及其工作人員不得透過行政許可、監督檢查、行政強制等，強制或變相強制外國投資者、外商投資企業轉讓技術。
之前，美國總統川普（特朗普）曾多次批評中國服務業大門緊閉，因此北京當局這次的舉措被視為對川普政府的一種回應。
據了解，這次公佈的金融領域鬆綁外企的政策分4大項20條。
所謂「4大項」是指：「深化對外開放」、「加大投資促進力度」、「深化投資便利化改革」和「保護外商投資合法權益」。
具體的鬆綁條款則涉及以下方面：全面取消外資銀行、證券公司、基金管理公司等金融機構在中國的業務範圍限制；減少外國投資者投資設立銀行、保險機構和開展相關業務的數量型准入條件；取消外國銀行赴中國設立外資法人銀行、分行的總資產要求；取消外國保險經紀公司在中國經營保險經紀業務的經營年限、總資產要求。
根據這份文件，中方將要擴大投資入股外資銀行和外資保險機構的股東範圍，取消中外合資銀行中方唯一或主要股東「必須是金融機構」的要求；允許外國保險集團公司投資設立保險類機構；繼續支持按照內外資一致的原則，辦理外資保險公司及其分支機構設立及變更等行政許可事項。
文件還規定，將於2020年取消中國境內證券公司、證券投資基金管理公司、期貨公司、壽險公司的外資持股比例不得超過51%的限制。
此外，文件還要求各地區、各部門要嚴格貫徹落實外商投資法及其配套法規，確保外商投資法各項制度切實有效執行；各地區應建立健全外商投資企業投訴受理機構；各地區、各部門應嚴格依法對外商投資實施行政許可，不得擅自改變。
同一天，中共央視發佈了中國海關總署和農業農村部正在研究解除美國禽肉對華出口限制事宜的快訊。
當天下午，商務部新聞發言人高峰在例行記者會上表示，中美已同意隨協議進展，分階段取消加徵關稅。
