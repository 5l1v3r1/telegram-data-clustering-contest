      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:46:31+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>After collecting work from her students, a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/schools">school</a> teacher from Florida was stunned to find a sweet gift nestled inside one of the folders.</p>
      <p>Mary Hall Chambers from Gorrie Elementary School in Tampa discovered nine-year-old Parker Williams had made a very touching gesture.</p>
      <p>The youngster had decided that his teacher wasn't being paid enough, so he secretly gifted her $15 of his birthday money to help make up for it.</p>
      <p>Alongside the cash, Parker had left a handwritten note, saying: "I don't think teachers get paid enough for what they do so will you except this gift".</p>

      <p>Chambers, who has been working as a teacher for 16 years, told <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/boy-9-donates-birthday-money-to-teacher-because-shes-not-paid-enough-230952432.html">Yahoo Lifestyle</a> that the act of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kindness">kindness</a> gave her "goosebumps" and she reacted by giving the boy a hug.</p>
      <p>She returned the note and the money to Parker, writing a message of grattitude for him along the bottom.</p>
      <p>It said: "I can't accept this, but appreciate the gesture, Parker. Students like you are the reason I teach."</p>
      <p>Parker's father, Darrell Williams later discovered the gift in his son's school bag and proudly shared a photo of it on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , where it garnered <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/viral">a lot of attention.</a></p>

      <p>One person replied: "Love this story! Way to go Parker! Such a great role model."</p>
      <p>Another commented: "Parker was definitely raised right!"</p>
      <p>A third wrote: "My heart just melted."</p>
      <p>Someone else said: "That is just beautiful. We love you Parker."</p>
      <p>A fifth responded: "Wow! He is a real champion. Truly a class act."</p>
      <p>A different user proclaimed that it might be "the best thing" they'd ever seen on Facebook. They added: "You guys are doing something right over there."</p>
      <p>Recently another young boy hit the headlines for making his teacher emotional - but in a very different way.</p>
      <p>Writing on Facebook, a teacher known only as Brooke, revealed that a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/teacher-cries-class-boys-heartbreaking-20560610">student had made her cry at work</a> after he asked a heartbreaking question.</p>
      <p>The little boy had asked when "the lady that puts food in his backpack is coming".</p>
      <p>He was referring to the guidance counselor, who had been giving him food to take home to feed his family, who were unable to afford to buy more.</p>
      <p>The young boy's words exposed the harsh reality that some little ones are facing today.</p>
      <p>She explained: "Today I cried at work. Not because I hate my job, or that it is just too hard (it really is).</p>
      <p>"Today I cried for a child, a child who so innocently talked about food, and the lack of it.</p>
      <p>"I lost it, I cried in front of 20 little people. No kid should ever be hungry, ever."</p>
      <p>Brooke sprung into action and sent a message to the teacher group chat. They all chipped in and made up a bag of food for the little one to take home.</p>
      <p>The school, which is based in Jacksboro, United States, is now starting a food pantry for its students to ensure they will be able to get food and hygiene products whenever they are needed.</p>
