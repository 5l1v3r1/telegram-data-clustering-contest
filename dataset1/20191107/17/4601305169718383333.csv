07 Nov 2019, 17:02 by Mark Frauenfelder



A restaurant in Singapore is under fire for putting live crabs in a claw game vending machine. After social media backlash, the restaurant owner has apologized and removed the crabs.
From Oddity Central:
The restaurant had posted a video of clients using its controversial claw machine to catch live crabs in early October, and then lifestyle website Shout posted its own video on it as well, which drew a lot of attention on social media. Apparently, for a $5 token, clients could try their luck at the claw machine, only instead of a plush animal, they could catch a live Sri Lankan crab. If they were lucky enough to catch one of the 500 to 800 gram crustaceans the restaurant would cook it for them for free.
