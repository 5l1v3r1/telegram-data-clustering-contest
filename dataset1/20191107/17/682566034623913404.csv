""I have known Peter for some time and worked with him at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane seven or eight years ago, so I know what a top bloke he is.
""He is a successful captain, a fine middle-order player and the sort of character who will help create a strong positive environment that will keep moving the club forward.
""He has been brought up in a tough environment and his background will help with the continued development of our young cricketers.""
