      <h1>OnePlus is Teasing Some New Bullshit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:00:21+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus has got something cooking, and it's not a phone.</p>
      <p>The company posted an image of whatever the hell it's been working on on its <a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_UK/status/1192412989607043077">Twitter account</a>, saying that the product would be "coming soon." It's a pretty dark picture, and turning up the brightness didn't illuminate the situation any further, although you can see a cheeky "nice try" slipped in there.</p>

      <p>Here's the same image with the brightness cranked up:</p>

      <p>So far, <a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_UK/status/1192409029924052993">OnePlus says</a> no one has guessed correctly, so that means it's not a tablet either if that tweet is to be trusted. The closest guess was that <a href="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_UK/status/1192412989607043077">it's a desk</a>, but that's not massively helpful. Looking at this tech Rorschach test, it looks like buttons on a cassette player, but there's no idea of scale - or anything really  - so who the fuck knows.</p>
      <p>It could be something related to the new <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/the-oneplus-tv-is-rather-fancy-but-you-better-not-expect-it-to-be-cheap/">OnePlus TV</a> or the rumoured wearable that's said to be launching alongside the OnePlus 8 next year.</p>
      <p>Either way, we haven't got the foggiest. Chime in with your suggestions in the comments.</p>
