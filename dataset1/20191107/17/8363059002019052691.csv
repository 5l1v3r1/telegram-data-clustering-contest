OnePlus is Teasing Some New Bullshit
07 Nov 2019, 17:00 by Shabana Arif
OnePlus has got something cooking, and it's not a phone.
The company posted an image of whatever the hell it's been working on on its Twitter account, saying that the product would be ""coming soon."" It's a pretty dark picture, and turning up the brightness didn't illuminate the situation any further, although you can see a cheeky ""nice try"" slipped in there.



Here's the same image with the brightness cranked up:



So far, OnePlus says no one has guessed correctly, so that means it's not a tablet either if that tweet is to be trusted. The closest guess was that it's a desk, but that's not massively helpful. Looking at this tech Rorschach test, it looks like buttons on a cassette player, but there's no idea of scale - or anything really  - so who the fuck knows.
It could be something related to the new OnePlus TV or the rumoured wearable that's said to be launching alongside the OnePlus 8 next year.
Either way, we haven't got the foggiest. Chime in with your suggestions in the comments.
