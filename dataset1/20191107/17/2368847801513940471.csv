上海進博會外商抱怨:去年簽的合同多數變廢紙

07 Nov 2019, 17:11

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】中共正在上海舉行第二屆國際進博會，用來展示其「對外開放」姿態。但最近兩項調查顯示，參加進博會的外企認為，這更像是一場公關造勢，去年在進博會簽署的多數合同，多數都是沒有下文的「象徵性」合約。
法新社報導，根據歐洲在華商會在進博會開幕前對歐洲在華企業的調查，這些企業認為，進博會只是一場對外展示中國市場的「公關造勢」，他們都質疑中共進一步開放市場的「誠意」。
調查顯示，去年參加第一屆進博會的歐洲商會會員，有一半獲得了合同，但因為簽約的中國公司不遵守約定，這些合同多數都沒了下文。有的歐洲商會成員稱這些合同為「象徵性」合同。
歐洲在華商會的結論是，「有關方面」過份強調公關效果，而不是為歐洲企業在華長遠發展創造健康的經營環境。商會高層在一份聲明中說，我們期待中共當局出台進一步開放市場的具體措施，而不是空洞的承諾，這些承諾我們聽得太多了。
美國在上海商會9月的一項調查也顯示，僅有10%的美國企業認為上海進博會很重要，而68.5%的美國企業認為無關緊要。
外國企業和政府經常抱怨他們在中國遭遇的障礙：規則模糊不清，官僚主義，歧視外企，優先國企，知識產權保護基本不存在等等。
中共官方宣稱去年上海進博會共達成570億美元的合同，今年進博會有來自150個國家的3000多個企業參加。但據外媒披露，很多參會的所謂「外企代表」是當局花錢僱傭的臨時演員，而進博會簽署的所謂「進口訂單」，有的是重複原有訂單合同，有的則是沒有實際約束力的備忘錄。
去年進博會，世界大經濟體七國集團（G7）都沒有政府首腦出席，韓國、澳大利亞等重要的中國貿易夥伴國，也沒有派出重量級人物參加。今年進博會，中共用高達150億美元的貿易合同，換來法國總統馬克龍出席站台。
不過，馬克龍在進博會開幕式上當面批評北京當局，指不少外國政府和商業團體對中共的「改革開放」承諾均持懷疑態度，並已發出警告，如果中共的開放跟其貿易夥伴長期不對稱，將招致貿易夥伴的報復。

Shanghai Foreign Trade Fair complained that most of the contracts signed last year turned waste paper

07 Nov 2019, 17:11

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The CCP is holding the second International Expo in Shanghai to show its ""opening up"" posture. However, two recent surveys show that foreign companies participating in the Expo believe that this is more like a public relations campaign. Most of the contracts signed at the Expo last year are mostly ""symbolic"" contracts.
Agence France-Presse reported that according to a survey of European companies in China before the opening of the China Chamber of Commerce in China, these companies believe that the Expo is only a ""public relations campaign"" to showcase the Chinese market. They all question the CCP's further opening up of the market. ""Sincerity.""
According to the survey, half of the members of the European Chamber of Commerce who participated in the first session of the Expo last year were awarded contracts, but most of these contracts were missing because the contracted Chinese companies did not comply with the agreement. Some European Chamber of Commerce members called these contracts ""symbolic"" contracts.
The European Chamber of Commerce in China concluded that the “related parties” over-emphasized the effectiveness of public relations, rather than creating a healthy business environment for European companies in the long-term development of China. The senior officials of the Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that we expect the Chinese authorities to introduce specific measures to further open up the market, rather than empty promises. We have heard too many of these promises.
A US survey conducted by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in September also showed that only 10% of US companies consider Shanghai Expo to be important, while 68.5% of US companies consider it irrelevant.
Foreign companies and governments often complain about the obstacles they face in China: unclear rules, bureaucracy, discrimination against foreign companies, priority state-owned enterprises, and the absence of intellectual property protection.
The CCP officially announced that Shanghai has reached a total of 57 billion US dollars in contracts last year. This year, more than 3,000 companies from 150 countries participated in the Expo. However, according to foreign media reports, many of the so-called ""foreign-enterprise representatives"" are temporary actors who are employed by the authorities, and the so-called ""import orders"" signed by the Expo will be repeated with the original order contracts, while others have no actual constraints. Memo.
Last year, at the Expo, the world's big economy, the Group of Seven (G7), did not have government leaders, and important Chinese trading partners such as South Korea and Australia did not send heavyweights. This year, the Expo will share a trade contract of up to 15 billion U.S. dollars in exchange for French President Mark Long to attend the platform.
However, Mark Long criticized the Beijing authorities in the opening ceremony of the Expo, saying that many foreign governments and business groups are skeptical about the CCP’s ""reform and opening"" commitments and have issued a warning if the CCP is open to its trading partners. Long-term asymmetry will lead to retaliation from trading partners.
