Top-10 Viewing Options: UFC on in the morning and Logan Paul at night. Just as God intended, I presume.
 
  1. KSI vs. Logan Paul/Billy Joe Saunders vs. Marcelo Esteban Coceres: Billy Joe making his American debut, playing second-fiddle to YouTube drama. Fitting. Poetic, even.
  2. Jamel Herring vs. Lamont Roach Jr./Kubrat Pulev vs. Rydell Booker: Herring vs. Roach is easily the best title fight of the weekend, and Pulev is a hell of a get for a co-main heavyweight for ESPN+.
  3. UFC Fight Night: Magomedsharipov vs. Kattar: Set your alarm clocks nice and early, the Dagestanians are upon us!






  4. OneFC: Masters of Fate:A bit of a step down in terms of quality, but they’re not far removed from having Demetrious Johnson fourth on one of their cards, so they’re probably due for a little cool-off.






  5. Navy vs. Penn State:The defending champs are back in action with a couple top-ranked wrestlers going up against ranked opponents.
  6. Bellator 233: Unbelievably pedestrian offering from Bellator this Friday. Wowzers.






  7. Fight To Win 131:Had to end eventually, but F2W’s run of loaded shows comes to an end this weekend.
  8. WGP 59: Still the best South American option for kickfighting, and I’m so happy they’re on Fite for more exposure.
  9. KSW 51: The Polish promotion near and dear to my heart is now on Fite! Easier viewing is always a good thing.
  t10. Pancrase 310: Title-less, non-descript card, but what else are you watching at 3am late Saturday night?






  t10. PBC Face-To-Face: Ortiz vs. Wilder:Say what you want about Deontay, but after this fight, and assuming the rematch gets made, his last six bouts would have been Stiverne-Ortiz-Fury-Breazeale-Ortiz-Fury. That’s one hell of a run. No Tom Schwarz’s in there.
 
4×5: Every week, UCS’s Luke Irwin will list his Top-5 bouts in each of the four major different combat sports that he’s looking forward to the most, regardless of any conventional criteria, merit, or logic.

Bold, Yet Probably Fruitless Predictions: I might be overarching a bit, but I’m well on my way to K-Mart for Christmas!
