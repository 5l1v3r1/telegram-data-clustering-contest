Nintendo Reveals Its Best Black Friday Deals For 2019 (North America)
Lots of discounted games and a console bundle
07 Nov 2019, 17:30 by Ryan Craddock



We're fast approaching Black Friday 2019 - which technically takes place on 29th November - and Nintendo has let us in on its very best offers on Nintendo Switch consoles, games, and accessories.
The highlight of the bunch is a Nintendo Switch console bundle which throws in a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at no extra charge. Starting on 28th November, you'll be able to get the bundle for $299.99 - the regular price of a standalone Switch console.
That's not all, though, as a selection of major Nintendo releases will have $20 knocked off their recommended retail price, and you'll even be able to save on accessories like Joy-Con and the Poké Ball Plus.
Here are all the offers, prices, and dates you need:
