      <p><b>EASTON, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities in Massachusetts are now calling the death of a woman found shot in the chest suspicious.</p>
      <p>Police officers were originally called to the second floor of an Easton two-family home on Wednesday for an unresponsive 49-year-old woman who had reportedly shot herself in the chest. The Brockton Enterprise reports that a man inside the home reported an accidental shooting and said he was unable to perform CPR because of a large amount of blood and the gunshot wound.</p>
      <p>Gregg Miliotte, spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn III, confirmed Wednesday night the incident is being investigated as suspicious. If it ultimately turns out to be a homicide, it would Easton's first in three years.</p>
      <p>Miliotte tells the Enterprise the death was still under investigation as of Thursday morning.</p>
