      <h1>Disney+ will hit the UK and four other European countries March 31st</h1>
      <h2>It's also coming to France, Germany, Italy and Spain on that date.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:12:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ will officially debut in the US, Canada and the Netherlands <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/11/disney-plus-price/">November 12th</a>, and Australia and New Zealand a week later. The rest of the world will need to wait a little longer to stream the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/avengers-endgame-disney-plus-marvel-release-date/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/the-mandalorian-disney-plus/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> on the service. But Disney fans in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain might want to mark March 31st on their calendars. That's when Disney+ will land in those countries.</p>

      <p>Rollout dates for other nations will be announced soon, Disney said. However, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/disney-plus-launch-musicals-documentaries-jeff-goldblum/">the movies and shows</a> you can stream will vary by territory, because Disney has rights agreements with other companies for much of its content. It'll have to untangle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/disney-plus-twitter-promotion/">shows and movies</a> from its deals in certain locales before it can bring those titles to Disney+.</p>
