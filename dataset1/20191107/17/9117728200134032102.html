      <h1>Marko shuts down potential Ricciardo return to Red Bull: "There's no room"</h1>

        <b>Amidst the rumour of F1 constructor <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> potentially leaving the sport at the end of this season, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> advisor Dr Helmut Marko has already ruled out a potential return of their former star <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, saying <i>"there's no room" </i>for the Aussie.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ricciardo somewhat shockingly left Red Bull at the end of 2018 for Renault, announcing his departure during the summer break of last season.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was part of the Bulls' program for a decade, having driven for them in junior categories, as well as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> and the main team. He competed for Red Bull Racing for five seasons between 2014 and 2018, winning seven races in his time there.</p>
      <p>Now he's departed, and with the rumour going around of Renault potentially shutting down their F1 program after a recent change of CEO's of the company as a whole, Marko has already shut down a return for Ricciardo.</p>

      <p><i>"Our drivers are fixed. There's no room," </i>the 76-year-old told <a href="https://f1-insider.com/f1/f1-steigt-renault-ende-des-jahres-aus/"><i>F1-Insider</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Even under the hypothetical that Renault indeed leaves the sport and Red Bull would get a third car on the grid, Marko doesn't see a return on the cards, simply saying a third seat isn't realistic.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"That hasn't been discussed. Either way: who would pay for that? </i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"I would assume they </i>[Renault] <i>would immediately be taken over by somebody else </i>[if they leave F1]<i>"</i>.</p>
