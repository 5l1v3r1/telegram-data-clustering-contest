Police have detained protesters in Paris
07 Nov 2019, 17:23 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

French police have evacuated more than 1,600 refugees from two camps in the north of Paris this Thursday. The move comes just a day after the government announced new anti-immigration measures in the country.

About 600 French police officers were evacuating the refugees from shelters to different centers, and the massive operation was carried out as soon as the rains hit.
Many of these migrants are from Afghanistan and from sub-Saharan Africa.
In an interview with the press, Paris police chief Didier Lallement said they would not allow such a dangerous situation.
Indeed, he said, the work they have done is part of the government's plan on immigration.
The government of President Emmanuel Macron blames the country's immigration crisis, but its plan is seen as an attempt to prevent radical parties from voting in public elections. municipalities that will be in place next year.
