      <p>A restaurant in Singapore is under fire for putting live crabs in a claw game vending machine. After social media backlash, the restaurant owner has apologized and removed the crabs.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.odditycentral.com/news/restaurant-slammed-for-using-live-crabs-as-prizes-for-claw-machine.html">Oddity Central</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The restaurant had posted a video of clients using its controversial claw machine to catch live crabs in early October, and then lifestyle website Shout posted its own video on it as well, which drew a lot of attention on social media. Apparently, for a $5 token, clients could try their luck at the claw machine, only instead of a plush animal, they could catch a live Sri Lankan crab. If they were lucky enough to catch one of the 500 to 800 gram crustaceans the restaurant would cook it for them for free.</blockquote>
