      <h1>Why Boks had the World Cup final won as early as the pre-game coin toss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:41:02+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Former Springboks attack coach Swys de Bruin has provided a unique perspective on the coin toss ahead of last Saturday’s World Cup final, claiming it had a huge impact on a match <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> went on to win 32-12 against England.</p>
      <p>In what looks to be a fairly innocuous encounter between captains <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/siya-kolisi/">Siya Kolisi</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a> with referee Jerome Garces, de Bruin explains how Kolisi dominated that situation through his body language. This is what he said:</p>

      <p>While some may not read into this too much, de Bruin emphasised how important this was. He also explained how <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/the-strange-reason-why-siya-kolisi-was-made-springboks-captain/">Kolisi had changed the way that he conducts himself</a> over the past few months.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old de Bruin left his post with the Springboks in August due to personal reasons, but he knows the players well and this makes his analysis interesting.</p>
      <p>What is most significant is that this pre-game meeting between the captains was in essence a microcosm of how the final panned out, as South Africa physically dominated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> from the very first minute.</p>

      <p>A number of excuses have been laid out for England in the wake of their 20-point loss, namely that their bus arrived half an hour late to the stadium and that it was hard to replicate the intensity that they showed against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> the week before.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Eddie Jones’ side looked a shell of the team that stunned the world with their sublime performance against the reigning champions in the semi-final.</p>

      <p>They were ravaged at the scrum and found it almost impossible to penetrate the Springboks defence. In the end, it resulted in a comfortable win for Rassie Erasmus’ side.</p>
      <p>What happened at the coin toss may just be Farrell’s style – and there is indeed a chance that some footage can be overanalysed, but there is no doubt that Kolisi’s conduct embodied South Africa’s dominant performance in Yokohama.</p>
