中大畢業禮上，校長段崇智爆肚的一番話
07 Nov 2019, 05:29 by 區家麟


我們想讓你知道的是段崇智願意略為放下身段，已得學生體諒，贏得一些掌聲。五個月來，林鄭政府無中生有，縱容警暴，觸發仇恨撕裂；大學校長們予人地位崇高的感覺，理應可以做得更多。



畢業禮的風風火火，也許會令人忽略主禮台上，中大校長段崇智不跟講稿，臨時爆肚，給畢業生的幾句話。
段崇智給人的印象，是一個躲在實驗室的科學家，木吶、會黑面、會拍抬，又不擅辭令；他旅美幾十年，與學生對話時，要講廣東話，明顯是苦差，辭不達意。看來是上一次對話戲劇性大團圓結局，學生最後道歉兼改口稱校長做「段爸」後，段崇智似乎明白了一些什麼，一下子由「校政」思維模式，轉化為家人關愛的思考角度理解學生。
百萬大道上，段崇智不讀官式演辭，直望台下數千人，「講心嗰句」，以英語講述三點。
一，社區︰每個人都活在社群中，沒有人是孤島。我們的社群很多元，有不同的人、不同的價值、膚色、不同衣著、不同文化；我們生活在一起，社群有生氣，建基於互相尊重與互相理解。我們的生命，有如乘坐飛船，在時空穿梭；終有一天，我們到達終站，會問這次旅程意義何在。旅途的意義，就在於你為這個社群做了什麼。
二，時間︰生命是流動的連續體。我們不是活在3D的立體世界，生命是4D世界，第四維度就是時間。今天是明天的昨天，今天也是昨天的明天。不要只在乎今天，不要滿足於今天的成功，也不要被今天的失敗嚇倒。
三，快樂︰史懷哲說：成功不是快樂的關鍵，快樂才是成功的關鍵；選擇你喜歡做的事，就會成功。
我以為，這番話，不只是給畢業生的臨別贈言，一眾高官、林鄭月娥、警隊、示威者、全體香港人都可以思考。我們畢竟活在同一社群，要包容體諒；我們也不能只見當下，為未來繫上難解的結。
段崇智願意略為放下身段，已得學生體諒，贏得一些掌聲。五個月來，林鄭政府無中生有，縱容警暴，觸發仇恨撕裂；大學校長們予人地位崇高的感覺，理應可以做得更多。

At the graduation ceremony of the University, the president’s Duan Chongzhi’s words
07 Nov 2019, 05:29 by District Jialin


What we want you to know is that Duan Chongzhi is willing to let go of his body. He has been forgiven and won some applause. In the past five months, the Lin Zheng government has been out of nothing, indulging in police violence and triggering a tearing of hatred; the presidents of the university have given a sense of lofty status and should be able to do more.



The graduation ceremony is so hot that it may be neglected on the main ceremony. Duan Chongzhi, the president of the University of China, does not follow the lectures, and temporarily gives a few words to the graduates.
Duan Chongzhi’s impression is that a scientist hiding in the laboratory, Muxi, will be black-faced, will be lifted, and not arrogant; he traveled to the United States for decades, when talking to students, he must speak Cantonese, obviously It is a hard time, and the words are unsatisfactory. It seems that the last dialogue was a dramatic reunion. After the students finally apologized and changed their minds to say that the principal was doing ""Duan Dao"", Duan Chongzhi seemed to understand something. He suddenly turned into a thinking mode of ""school politics"" thinking mode and turned into family care. Understand the students.
On Million Avenue, Duan Chongzhi did not read official speeches, and looked down on thousands of people under the stage. He said ""three words"" in English.
First, the community: everyone lives in the community, no one is an island. Our community is multi-faceted, with different people, different values, skin colors, different clothes, different cultures; we live together, the community is angry, based on mutual respect and mutual understanding. Our lives are like flying in a spaceship, in time and space; one day, we will arrive at the terminal and ask what the significance of this journey is. The meaning of the journey is what you did for this community.
Second, time: life is a continuum of flow. We are not living in a three-dimensional world, life is a 4D world, and the fourth dimension is time. Today is tomorrow's yesterday, today is also yesterday's tomorrow. Don't just care about today, don't be satisfied with today's success, and don't be intimidated by today's failure.
Third, happiness.. Schweitzer said: Success is not the key to happiness, happiness is the key to success; choosing what you like to do will succeed.
I thought that these words are not just for the parting of the graduates. A lot of high officials, Lin Zhengyue, police, demonstrators, and all Hong Kong people can think. After all, we live in the same community and we must be considerate; we can't just see the present and tie the knot for the future.
Duan Chongzhi is willing to put down his body slightly, and he has been forgiven by the students and won some applause. In the past five months, the Lin Zheng government has been out of nothing, indulging in police violence and triggering a tearing of hatred; the presidents of the university have given a sense of lofty status and should be able to do more.
