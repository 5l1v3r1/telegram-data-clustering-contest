中南海權斗多慘烈？兩大事件爆祕辛

07 Nov 2019, 05:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】中共四中全會期間，重慶第三號人物任學鋒離奇死亡，閉幕式緊急從原訂的京西賓館移到「大會堂」等兩大事件，都使這個推遲了近兩年的全會透露出「權鬥慘烈」的跡象。
中共中央候補委員、重慶3把手任學鋒，在中共十九届四中全會閉幕當天出事，任是重慶市的第三把手，典型地方高官。
网上流傳出他是在京西賓館7樓墜樓死亡。任學鋒成為中共首位在中央全會期間離奇身亡的高官。多方消息稱，任死亡後，超過500人參加的四中全會閉幕式，緊急從原訂的京西賓館移到北京大會堂。
即使中共沒有承認相關消息，但有眼尖網友從央視側錄的閉幕式典禮中發現，地點是北京大會堂。
有海外觀察員懷疑，任學鋒死因不單純，很可能是被自殺，跟中南海慘烈權鬥有關，在戒備森嚴、重重保衛的京西賓館被自殺，更增添滅口的可能性。
身為中央候補委員，任學鋒葬禮也沒有安排在臨近的八寶山，而是捨近求遠降格到昌平，去找一個僅能容納200人以下的告別廳舉行，更讓各界感到蹊蹺。

任學鋒家屬疑遭到軟禁

中共處理後事的過程也疑點重重，先是在任學鋒死後第4天公布死訊，公布之後數小時內立即進行火化，而火化過程又嚴格保密，甚至在官方公布的北京昌平殯儀館內，竟然在該時段內所有的監視系統全部關閉，使得火化過程被懷疑並非真的進行、或是有其他內情。
另有訊息稱，任學鋒後事處理是由重慶常務副市長吳存榮負責，並非任學鋒家屬，而且外界無法跟任學鋒家屬取得連繫，疑似遭到軟禁，但無法獲得官方證實。
自由亞洲引述熟悉重慶官場的趙先生透露，年僅54歲的任學鋒原本是作為重要後備人才重用的，也是被當作繼黃奇帆之後，又一個懂經濟的技術型官僚。一度傳出要成重慶的接班人。其突然死亡，只能說高層權力之間又出了大事。
趙先生說，有兩個朋友正式告訴他，任學鋒是在京西賓館墜樓死亡的。因為他知道在這種時候選擇自殺的話，就把自己解脫掉了。
任學鋒是南開大學管理學博士，曾任天津副市長，2014年8月主政廣州，後來升任廣東省委副書記兼廣州書記，去年10月才被平調到重慶市任副書記。
大紀元評論員王赫說，四中全會期間，任學鋒的離奇死亡，「會議組織工作」的格外嚴格，數百名與會中共官員遭變相軟禁，以及全會期間劉雲山、李長春、劉奇葆的家人被抓等傳聞，都使此次全會漏出一絲血腥，重重黑幕仍遮不住會議中的刀光劍影。

How hard is Zhongnanhai’s power? Two major events

07 Nov 2019, 05:51

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, Ren Xuefeng, the third person in Chongqing, died bizarrely. The closing ceremony was urgently moved from the original Jingxi Hotel to the ""City Hall"" and other two events. This plenary, which has been postponed for nearly two years, reveals signs of ""powerful tragic"".
Alternate member of the CPC Central Committee and Chongqing No. 3 Ren Xuefeng, who was involved in the closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, was the third-in-command of Chongqing, a typical local high official.
It was rumored that he died on the 7th floor of Jingxi Hotel. Ren Xuefeng became the first high-ranking official of the CCP who died in the Central Plenary Session. According to various sources, after the death, more than 500 people attended the closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session and moved to the Beijing City Hall from the original Jingxi Hotel.
Even though the CCP did not acknowledge the relevant news, some eye-dropping netizens found in the closing ceremony of the CCTV side record that the location was the Beijing City Hall.
Some overseas observers suspect that Ren Xuefeng’s death is not simple. It is likely to be suicide. It is related to the fierce struggle of Zhongnanhai. He was suicide in the heavily guarded and heavily guarded Jingxi Hotel, adding to the possibility of extinction.
As an alternate member of the Central Committee, Ren Xuefeng’s funeral was not arranged in the nearby Babao Mountain. Instead, he went down to Changping and went to a farewell hall that could only accommodate 200 people or less.

Ren Xuefeng’s family is suspected of being under house arrest

The CCP’s process of dealing with the aftermath was also very doubtful. First, the death was announced on the fourth day after Ren Xuefeng’s death. The cremation was carried out within a few hours after the announcement, and the cremation process was strictly confidential. Even in the officially announced Beijing Changping Funeral Parlour, All monitoring systems were closed during this time period, making the cremation process suspected not to be true or otherwise.
According to another message, Ren Xuefeng’s aftermath was handled by Wu Cunrong, the deputy mayor of Chongqing. He was not a family member of Ren Xuefeng, and the outside world could not get contact with Ren Xuefeng’s family. He was suspected of being under house arrest but could not obtain official confirmation.
Free Asia quoted Mr. Zhao, who is familiar with Chongqing's officialdom. He revealed that Ren Xuefeng, who was only 54 years old, was originally reused as an important reserve talent. He was also regarded as a technical bureaucrat who understood the economy after Huang Qifan. Once passed out to become the successor of Chongqing. Sudden death, can only say that there is a big deal between the high-level powers.
Mr. Zhao said that two friends officially told him that Ren Xuefeng died in the Jingxi Hotel. Because he knew that he chose to commit suicide at this time, he freed himself.
Ren Xuefeng is a Ph.D. in management from Nankai University. He served as deputy mayor of Tianjin. He was in charge of Guangzhou in August 2014. Later he was promoted to deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Guangzhou secretary. In October last year, he was transferred to Chongqing as deputy secretary.
Epoch Times commentator Wang He said that during the Fourth Plenary Session, Ren Xuefeng’s bizarre death, “conference organization work” was exceptionally strict, hundreds of CCP officials were under house arrest, and the families of Liu Yunshan, Li Changchun and Liu Qiwei were arrested during the plenary session. Such rumors have caused the whole plenary to leak a trace of blood, and the heavy black curtain still can't cover the swords and swords in the meeting.
