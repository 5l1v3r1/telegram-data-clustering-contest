      <p>Inoue has lived up to “The Monster” nickname throughout his career. At bantamweight, his three top-quality opponents have lasted a combined 7:22, and the heavy-handed Inoue is going to have a partisan crowd on hand at the Saitama Super Arena.</p>
      <p>Donaire is 36 years old and not in his prime, but he still possesses big knockout power in the form of a lethal left hook. Once one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, he’ll look to pull of a shock result in Japan and add to his Hall of Fame legacy.</p>
