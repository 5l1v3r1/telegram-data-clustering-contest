編劇、填詞人陳心遙談創作與前景
07 Nov 2019, 05:38 by 香港中文大學人類學系


我們想讓你知道的是在創作過程中，一些看似沒有用的東西，可能其實最有用。Saville笑言：「我是我，我是這樣去思考、創作，一些人類學的思維，已經潛移默化地在其中啦。」



「我從小到大都喜歡文學，大學開始玩樂器和嘗試填詞。但我覺得這和專門去讀這些科目，是兩件事來的。創作的世界很大，多接觸不同的社群與文化，可能更能刺激你的思考。」陳心遙（Saville）在大學修讀人類學，畢業之後，對電影的興趣愈發濃厚，慢慢開始在這個行業尋找機會。「讀書的時候就喜歡看電影，之後越看越多，就嘗試接一些短片、廣告的project來邊做邊學，由不懂學到懂。」
但當被問到有何入行經驗可作分享時，Saville卻是「拒絕」的。「世界變得太快，如果我答了、別人真的信了，會害人的！」在Saville看來，隨著社會的變遷、科技的進步，即使一個普通年輕人，影片製作技術可能亦已經非常純熟。「我認識一些編劇、導演，說到拍片、剪片，他們的仔女比他們更加叻！這是一個視像爆炸的年代，人人拿著電話、人人有部電腦，人人都有不同的方法，可以製作出好看的影像。」
前輩的經驗，到了今時今日未必適用，很難以一條定律來說年輕人應該怎樣做。但話說回來，「製作技術可能很多人都會，但那不是作品的全部。『創作』不是只靠技術去實現，而是要對世界有多些認識、再從你自己的獨特角度去理解、詮釋。」
說到創作，靈感與養分從何而來？Saville的作品，如《狂舞派》、《哪一天我們會飛》，常被形容為「本土電影」。 「但我沒有刻意去想本不本土這些問題……創作本來就是源自生活的喇！我在哪裡生活，就最容易寫得到哪裡的故事，這是很自然的。」但這並不是說，創作者要固步自封、固守己見；Saville解釋，在近年的合拍片熱潮之中，不少著名的香港導演要到中國大陸拍攝電影，也會先在當地居住生活一段時間。「要寫出貼地的劇本、拍出觸動人心的故事，始終是要瞭解民情、紮根於一個地方的。所以我覺得，『本土』這個概念，要有多點思考和討論才有意思，不然就容易變成純粹是情緒宣洩、標籤噱頭了。」
不過，Saville又補充︰「電影的生命有很多人參與：電影拍出來，誰幫你剪預告片、誰寫廣告語、誰安排宣傳活動、誰協調院線排片……都是團隊工作來的，其中有很多經濟的考量。我自己或許不會刻意要宣傳『本土』，但發行公司也可能有他們的判斷。那我會覺得，在一個自由的市場之中，這是沒有問題的——觀眾不是傻的嘛！宣傳是和觀眾的一個博弈，如果只是賣本土情懷但電影不好看，試多兩次，觀眾就不會買賬了。最緊要是有一個自由的、大家可以選擇的創作氣氛；最重要的始終是作品本身。」
身兼編劇、監製、作詞人等多種角色，Saville怎樣看香港電影與音樂的發展前景呢？「我沒有特別悲觀，也不是特別樂觀；事情始終是要做，有些東西始終是不會消失的。就說電台吧，我讀書的時候都已經說是夕陽行業，但我畢業後在電台工作了很多年，直到現在我離開電台了，廣播電台也還未消失喔！電影也一樣，可能未必有最風光的時候那麼高收入、那麼多人注意，但它是會繼續存在的。電影也只是一個format，可能以後最流行的變成廣告、網劇、短片，但總而言之，觀眾不會突然對『用影像去說故事』這件事完全失去興趣。放在一個大世界裡看，我所做的創作，所需要的資源其實很少，那就去和其他人競爭囉，競爭是現實來的，不能迴避。出路不是想出來，是做出來的嘛。」
同樣，大學的數年時光，放到整個人生裡看，也只是很短的一段時間。「有些師弟師妹，讀書的時候會擔憂將來的發展，這很正常。但我覺得也不用過分逼迫自己，甚至反而浪費了這幾年自由自在、喜歡做什麼就做什麼的階段——到你出來工作就會發現，可以選擇的空間越來越小，因為你的時間都被別人買走了。」Saville說，回過頭，他也會想，自己讀大學的時候，是不是應該不要那麼懶呢？不只是說讀書、學習，也是說，不要那麼懶不去玩——自己鍾意、有興趣、好玩的東西，就應該趁有時間多點去做。
更何況，人類學這學科本身的優勢，就是要讓同學去打開眼睛看世界。談到人類學訓練對他的影響，Saville以編劇工作為例：「人物是劇本的核心，人物寫得好，很多問題都會解決。但對於你要寫的某一類人，你本身可能是沒什麼認識的，那怎麼辦呢？不外乎是靠想像、靠在其他作品中得出的觀感、甚至是刻板印象。我想，最好的方法，是在當下找一些真的是這樣的人，和他們傾談，而這exactly就是人類學家在做田野考察時做的事啊。又譬如，在戲劇裡面，不同角色之間是各有關聯的。你寫一個『反派』，是想令觀眾更加瞭解那個『正派』的主角是一個怎樣的人。而在人類學裡面，去探索異文化，最終也是想瞭解自己：世界連成一線，『他者』總是相對於『自我』而言的。這種概念不是每個人都有的啊！」
在創作過程中，一些看似沒有用的東西，可能其實最有用。Saville笑言：「我是我，我是這樣去思考、創作，一些人類學的思維，已經潛移默化地在其中啦。」

Screenwriter and lyricist Chen Xinyao talk about creation and prospects
07 Nov 2019, 05:38 by Department of Anthropology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong


What we want you to know is that some seemingly useless things in the creative process may actually be the most useful. Saville said with a smile: ""I am me. I think and create like this. Some anthropological thinking has been subtly in it.""



""I grew up in literature, and I started to play music and try to write lyrics. But I think it is two things to go to these subjects. The world of creation is very big, and it is more accessible to different communities and cultures. Maybe It can stimulate your thinking."" Saville studied anthropology at the university. After graduation, he became more interested in movies and slowly began to look for opportunities in this industry. ""When I was reading, I liked to watch movies. After I saw more and more, I tried to pick up some short films and advertisements to learn by doing. I didn't know how to learn.""
But when asked about the experience of sharing, Saville was ""rejected."" ""The world has become too fast. If I answer it, others will believe it, it will hurt people!"" In Saville's view, with the changes of society and the advancement of technology, even a normal young person, film production technology may also Already very skilled. ""I know some screenwriters and directors. When it comes to filming and film-cutting, their daughters are even more embarrassed than them! This is a time when video explosions occur. Everyone has a phone, everyone has a computer, everyone is different. The method can make a good-looking image.""
The experience of seniors may not be applicable today, and it is difficult to say what a young person should do with a law. But then again, ""production technology may be a lot of people, but that is not the whole of the work. ""Creation"" is not achieved by technology alone, but to have more understanding of the world and to understand and interpret it from your own unique perspective. .""
When it comes to creation, where does inspiration and nutrients come from? Saville's works, such as ""The Dance"" and ""Which day we fly,"" are often described as ""local movies."" ""But I didn't deliberately think about the problem of not being local. The creation is originally from life! It is natural that I live where it is the easiest to write the story."" But this is not to say, The creators have to stand still and stick their own opinions; Saville explained that in the recent co-production boom, many famous Hong Kong directors have to live in China for a while, and they will live in the local area for a while. ""To write a script that is affixed to the ground and to make a story that touches people's hearts, it is always necessary to understand the feelings of the people and to be rooted in one place. Therefore, I think that the concept of ""native"" should be more interesting to think and discuss, otherwise it would be interesting. It is easy to become purely emotional catharsis and label gimmicks.""
However, Saville added: ""There is a lot of people involved in the life of the film: the film is filmed, who can help you cut the trailer, who writes the slogan, who arranges the promotion, who coordinates the cinema line... all work by the team, There are a lot of economic considerations. I may not deliberately promote ""local"", but the issuing company may have their judgment. Then I think that in a free market, there is no problem - the audience It’s not stupid! Propaganda is a game with the audience. If you only sell local feelings but the movie is not good, try it twice, the audience will not buy it. The most important thing is to have a free atmosphere that everyone can choose; The most important thing is always the work itself.""
As a writer, producer, lyricist and many other characters, how does Saville see the development prospects of Hong Kong movies and music? ""I am not particularly pessimistic, nor particularly optimistic; things are always done, and some things will never disappear. Just say radio, when I was studying, I said that it was the sunset industry, but I worked on the radio after graduation. For many years, until now I left the radio station, the radio station has not disappeared yet! The movie is the same, may not have the highest income, so many people pay attention, but it will continue to exist. The movie is just one Format, may become the most popular advertisements, online dramas, and short films in the future, but in short, the audience will not suddenly lose interest in the use of images to tell stories. In a big world, I will create The resources needed are actually very few. Then we will compete with other people. Competition is reality and cannot be avoided. The way out is not to come out, it is made.""
Similarly, the university’s years of time have been seen throughout life, and it’s only a short period of time. ""Some younger brothers and sisters will worry about future development when they are studying. This is normal. But I don't think it would be too much to persecute myself, or even waste the years of freedom and what I like to do. - Come to you. The job will find that the space you can choose is getting smaller and smaller, because your time has been bought by others.” Saville said, when he turned around, he would also think that when he was in college, should he not be so lazy? ? It’s not just about reading and studying, but also saying, don’t be so lazy to play – you should have time to do more things that you like, interested, and fun.
What's more, the advantage of anthropology itself is to let students open their eyes to see the world. Speaking of the influence of anthropological training on him, Saville takes the writer's work as an example: ""The character is the core of the script, the characters are well written, and many problems will be solved. But for some kind of person you want to write, you may not know anything about it. What should I do? It is nothing more than imagination, and even stereotypes that come from other works. I think the best way is to find some people who are really like this in the moment, and They talk, and this is exactly what anthropologists do when doing fieldwork. For example, in drama, different characters are related. You write a ""reverse"" to make the audience more aware. The protagonist of the ""decent"" is a kind of person. In anthropology, to explore different cultures, and ultimately want to know yourself: the world is connected, the ""other"" is always relative to the ""self"". Kind of concept is not for everyone!""
In the creative process, something that seems to be useless may actually be the most useful. Saville said with a smile: ""I am me. I think and create like this. Some anthropological thinking has been subtly in it.""
