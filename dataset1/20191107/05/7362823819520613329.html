      <h1>AOC mocks JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon's concern about 'harsh' criticism: 'Billionaires are asking for a safe space'</h1>

      <p>Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that billionaires are looking for a “safe space” from criticism after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>’s rhetoric “vilifies successful people.”</p>
      <p>“Y’all, the billionaires are asking for a safe space - you know, in addition to the entire US economy and political lobbying industry,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in reaction to Dimon saying that Warren used “pretty harsh words” against him and other billionaires.</p>

      <p>“I don’t like vilifying anybody,” he told CNBC. “I think we should applaud successful people.”</p>

          <b>JAMIE DIMON ACCUSES ELIZABETH WARREN OF VILIFYING 'SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE'</b>

      </p>
      <p>It wasn't the first time that comments by Dimon appeared to irritate Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
      <p>In March, the Democrat lashed out at the banking executive after he criticized the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/green-new-deal">Green New Deal</a>, saying the climate-change legislation that Ocasio-Cortez co-authored "could hurt the economy," <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/434984-ocasio-cortez-fires-back-at-jamie-dimon-after-ceo-dismisses-green-new-deal">according to The Hill</a>.</p>
      <p>Ocasio-Cortez countered that perhaps Dimon wasn't the "best authority" to comment on the subject.</p>
      <p>"JP Morgan agreed to pay out *$13 billion* over its massive role in mortgage schemes w the ‘08 recession," Ocasio-Cortez wrote. "They also finance major fossil fuel pipelines. It’s big money."</p>
      <p>"So maybe they *aren’t* the best authority on prioritizing economic wellbeing of everyday people &amp; the planet," she added.</p>

      <p>Then in April, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Ocasio-Cortez clashed with Dimon over the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
      <p>“I represent kids that go to jail for jumping a [subway] turnstile because they can’t afford a MetroCard,” Ocasio-Cortez told Dimon during the hearing. “Do you think that more folks should have gone to jail for their role in a financial crisis that led to 7.8 million foreclosures in the 10 years between 2007 and 2016?”</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, Warren tweeted that Dimon and other billionaires achieved success partly because of “opportunities, workforce, and public services that we all paid for.”</p>

      <p>She has said that she would place higher taxes on the top 1 percent of earners to help pay for her estimated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warrens-52t-medicare-for-all-plan-revealed-campaign-still-claims-no-middle-class-tax-hikes-needed">$52 trillion Medicare-for-All</a> plan.</p>
      <p>“It's only fair that [Dimon] and his billionaire friends chip in to make sure everyone else has a chance to succeed,” she tweeted.</p>
      <p>Dimon has supported higher taxes for the wealthy in the past, but he told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-says-sen-elizabeth-warren-vilifies-successful-people.html">CNBC</a> that Warren’s Accountable Capitalism Act would change the “complete nature of how you run a corporation.”</p>
