【錶壇焦點】黃金錶殼Astron特別款現身！SEIKO 1969石英Astron五十週年限量版

十月底的時候，SEIKO發表為了紀念Quartz Astron 35SQ 50週年的SBXD002，18K黃金錶殼加上可以接收GPS信號校正時間的新機芯3X22，復刻當年原款的外型，和現行的Astron比較運動款的外型有著滿大的差異。


Astron五十週年限量版 (SBXD002) | 錶徑43.9mm，18K黃金錶殼，3X22太陽能機芯，時間及日期指示，全球限量50只，建議售價日幣3,800,000(不含稅)，約台幣100萬。

今年在不斷提到1969年對於鐘錶史來說是個重要的年份，因為2019年是滿多很具代表性事件發生的五十周年，像是三個品牌陣營聯手推出錶壇第一枚自動上鏈計時機芯，SEIKO也在那年的12月25日，推出全球第一只石英錶35SQ。當時35SQ的數據每月誤差±5秒，每天則是誤差±0.2秒，在精準度方面完勝了那時的機械錶，為日後重創瑞士製錶業的石英風暴鳴響了第一槍。


Astron限量版的錶殼做了鐫刻處理，新機芯3X22的搭載也有助降低錶殼厚度。

SEIKO今年為了Quartz Astron 35SQ 50週年，推出Astron五十週年限量版，不過搭載的不是初始設定的石英機芯，而是Astron在2012年推出的時候主打的GPS太陽能機芯，能透過GPS衛星電波取得當下的正確的位置及時間。這款紀念版本雖然不是搭載石英機芯的全然復刻，但結合初款Astron的外型，以及後來的太陽能機芯，也算是做了一個Astron系列成就的整合。


1969年SEIKO推出的第一只石英錶Quartz Astron 35SQ，今年的特別版就是為了紀念它問世50周年而推出。

乍看之下這款五十週年限量版和1969年的35SQ相似度很高，但錶冠和時標等細節都有差異，35SQ是內縮式錶冠，而限量款的時標多了一道切面比較立體。這次的限量版搭的是新機芯3X22，當它設定GPS衛星對時，數據顯示可以達到十萬年只有1秒誤差的驚人精準度。


實心底蓋上刻有限量編號及紀念字樣，全球限量50只，11月28日正式發售。

不過也有一派說法對於3X22機芯在沒有接收信號時平均月誤差大約是±15秒有點微詞，但就象徵意義來說，SEIKO為了這個殼型特別研發出新機芯3X22，讓錶殼厚度可以進行縮減，和以往大塊頭典型運動錶的Astron做出了差異，一眼就可以看出它是特別版，或許也是為Astron之後的其他可能性開始鋪路。

[Focus on the table] Astron special case of the gold case! SEIKO 1969 quartz Astron 50th Anniversary Limited Edition
07 Nov 2019, 05:24 by Wang Hao Amanda Wang
At the end of October, SEIKO released the SBXD002 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Quartz Astron 35SQ. The 18K yellow gold case and the new movement 3X22, which can receive the GPS signal correction time, re-enact the original model of the year, compared with the current Astron sports model. The appearance is full of differences.


Astron 50th Anniversary Limited Edition (SBXD002) | Table diameter 43.9mm, 18K yellow gold case, 3X22 solar movement, time and date indication, global limited edition 50, recommended price of Japanese yen 3,800,000 (excluding tax), about NT$100 Million.

This year, it is said that 1969 is an important year for the history of watches, because 2019 is the 50th anniversary of a very representative event, such as the three brands to join hands to launch the first automatic winding of the table. The chronograph movement, SEIKO also launched the world's first quartz watch 35SQ on December 25 of that year. At that time, the 35SQ data had a monthly error of ±5 seconds, and the error was ±0.2 seconds per day. In terms of accuracy, the mechanical watch at that time was won, and the first shot was fired for the quartz storm that hit the Swiss watch industry in the future.


The Astron limited edition case has been engraved, and the new 3X22 movement also helps to reduce the thickness of the case.

SEIKO launched the Astron 50th Anniversary Limited Edition for the 50th anniversary of the Quartz Astron 35SQ this year, but it is not equipped with an initial quartz movement, but the main GPS solar movement that Astron launched in 2012, which can be obtained by GPS satellite waves. The correct location and time of the moment. Although this commemorative version is not a complete re-enactment of the quartz movement, but combined with the appearance of the original Astron, and later solar movement, it can be considered an integration of the Astron series of achievements.


In 1969, SEIKO launched the first quartz watch Quartz Astron 35SQ. This year's special edition was launched to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

At first glance, this 50th anniversary limited edition is very similar to the 35SQ in 1969, but the details of the crown and the time scale are different. The 35SQ is a retractable crown, and the time stamp of the limited edition has one more. The cut surface is relatively three-dimensional. This limited edition is equipped with the new movement 3X22. When it sets the GPS satellite pair, the data display can reach the amazing accuracy of only 1 second error in 100,000 years.


The solid bottom cover is engraved with a limited number of numbers and commemorative words. It is limited to 50 pieces worldwide and will be officially released on November 28.

However, there is also a saying that the average monthly error of the 3X22 calibre is about ±15 seconds when there is no signal, but in a symbolic sense, SEIKO has developed a new movement 3X22 for this shell, so that the thickness of the case can be made. The reduction is different from the previous Astron, which is a typical sports watch. It can be seen at a glance that it is a special edition, and perhaps paving the way for other possibilities after Astron.
