      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): theedgemarkets.com highlighted nine stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. One stock displayed positive momentum while eight had negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stock with positive momentum was :</p>
      <p>Prolexus Bhd - up six sen at 96.5 sen</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>DGB Asia Bhd - up 0.5 sen at 17 sen</p>
      <p>PBA Holdings Bhd -down two sen at RM1.13</p>
      <p>Luster Industries Bhd - unchanged at 9.5 sen</p>
      <p>Malaysian Bulk Carriers Bhd (Maybulk) - up 0.5 sen at 70 sen</p>
      <p>Homeritz Corp Bhd - down 1.5 sen at 70 sen</p>
      <p>Carimin Petroleum Bhd - up four sen at RM1.37</p>
      <p>FoundPac Group Bhd - up two sen at 50.5 sen</p>
      <p>EG Industries Bhd - up 0.5 sen at 48.5 sen<br/><br/>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
