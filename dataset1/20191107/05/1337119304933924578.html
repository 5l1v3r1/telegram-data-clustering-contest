      <h1>San Francisco proceeds with e-cigarette sales ban after decisive vote</h1>
      <h2>More than 80 percent voted against Proposition C</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T05:17:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 05:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/mary-beth-griggs" target="_blank">Mary Beth Griggs</a></address>
      <p>San Francisco will ban the sale of e-cigarettes entirely starting in 2020, after the resounding defeat of a proposition designed to thwart the restrictions. The ballot measure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758505/san-francisco-juul-ban-fda-e-cigarettes-sf">was the last hurdle for the proposed ban</a>, which was <a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3895574&amp;GUID=BABC44F3-8798-49AF-A75D-A27561A77B0D">passed into law</a> in June.</p>
      <p>Early results from the city’s Department of Elections show that <a href="https://sfelections.sfgov.org/november-5-2019-election-results-summary">slightly more than 80 percent</a> of voters opposed Proposition C, which would have overturned the ban and paved the way for looser regulations. Initially, Proposition C was heavily supported by Juul Labs, which poured an <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11784165/should-san-francisco-ban-the-sale-of-e-cigarettes-your-guide-to-proposition-c">estimated $18 million</a> into promoting the measure. Efforts to defeat the proposition were spearheaded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who spent about $6.6 million to oppose the proposition.</p>
      <p>Juul abruptly ceased support for Proposition C in September, around the same time that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20883188/juul-ceo-replaced-advertising-flavor-ban-regulators-burns-crosthwaithe">company replaced its CEO</a> and stopped advertising its products in the United States. Juul has been under fire recently amid a continued rise in underage vaping, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899114/vaping-lung-injury-seizures-explosions-e-cigarette-youth-vaping-flavor-bans">outbreak of injuries</a> associated with using THC products in e-cigarettes, and a lawsuit made by a former executive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940162/juul-contaminated-pods-lawsuit-svp-siddharth-breja-flavor">alleging that Juul shipped contaminated pods</a>.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco ban is one of the more comprehensive in the country. Other jurisdictions have proposed bans on sales of flavored e-cigarette products, but San Francisco’s prohibits sales of all products not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. So far, no e-cigarette products have gotten that approval.</p>
