      <p>WELLINGTON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/New-Zealand">New Zealand</a> lawmakers have joined forces across the aisle to pass a bill aimed at combating <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/climate-change">climate change</a>.</p>
      <p>The Zero Carbon bill aims to make New Zealand reduce its <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/greenhouse-gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions to the point the country becomes mostly carbon neutral by 2050. It gives some leeway to farmers, who bring in much of the country's foreign income.</p>
      <p>The bill was spearheaded by the liberal government but in the end was supported by the main conservative opposition party, which nevertheless promised changes if it wins the next election.</p>
      <p>The bill would require all greenhouse gases except <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Global-warming">methane</a> from animals to be reduced to net zero by 2050. Methane emissions would be reduced by 10% by 2030 and by between about one-quarter and one-half by 2050.</p>
