美官員：川習或將延12月簽協議 倫敦列可能地點

（中央社華盛頓6日綜合外電報導）美國行政部門一位高層官員今天告訴路透社，美國總統川普與中國國家主席習近平可能延後到12月會面，簽署各界期待已久的臨時貿易協議，倫敦是可能地點之一，但尚未確定。
這位要求匿名的官員說，時間延後主因雙方還在討論協議條款和會談地點，這項所謂「第一階段」協議仍有可能無法達成，但達成協議的可能性較高。
川普與習近平原定在11月中舉行的亞太經濟合作會議（APEC）領袖會議場邊會談，但這項峰會臨時取消。
這位官員說，川習會的建議替代地點多達數十個，倫敦是可能地點之一，因為川普12月3至4日將赴歐洲出席北大西洋公約組織（NATO）高峰會，峰會後兩人可以在倫敦會面。他說：「此事在考慮之中，但還沒有作決定。」
川習會也可能在歐洲與亞洲其他多處地點舉行，但歐洲的地點可能性較高，其中包括瑞典和瑞士。他又說，川普建議的美國愛阿華州似乎已經排除。
中國近來力促美方取消更多關稅，此事將會列入討論，但預料不會影響達成臨時協議的進展。這位官員說，因為川普尋求在2020年競選連任，而且面臨國會的彈劾調查，據信中國認為迅速達成協議最有機會取得有利條款。
白宮發言人迪爾（Judd Deere）表示：「談判持續進行，第一階段協議的文本有所進展。一旦要宣布簽署協議地點，我們會讓各位知道。」（譯者：林治平）1081107

US officials: Chuan Xi may extend the agreement in December. London may list possible locations

A senior executive of the US administration told Reuters today that US President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may postpone their meeting in December and sign a long-awaited interim trade agreement. London is One of the possible locations, but has not yet been determined.
The official who asked for anonymity said that the delay was mainly due to the fact that the parties were still discussing the terms of the agreement and the venue of the meeting. The so-called ""first phase"" agreement may still be impossible to reach, but the possibility of reaching an agreement is high.
Trump and Xi Jin Plain are scheduled to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting held in mid-November, but the summit was temporarily cancelled.
The official said that the number of alternatives suggested by the Sichuan Society was as many as dozens. London is one of the possible locations because Trump will go to Europe to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit on December 3-4, after the summit. The two can meet in London. He said: ""The matter is under consideration, but no decision has been made yet.""
The Sichuan Learning Association may also be held in Europe and many other locations in Asia, but locations in Europe are more likely, including Sweden and Switzerland. He added that the United States Iowa State recommended by Trump seems to have ruled out.
China has recently urged the US to cancel more tariffs. The matter will be included in the discussion, but it is not expected to affect the progress of the interim agreement. The official said that because Trump seeks to run for re-election in 2020 and faces impeachment investigations by Congress, it is believed that China believes that a speedy agreement will have the best chance of obtaining favorable terms.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said: ""The negotiations have continued and the text of the first phase of the agreement has progressed. Once we have announced the location of the agreement, we will let everyone know."" (Translator: Lin Zhiping) 1081107
