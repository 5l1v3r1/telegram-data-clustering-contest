      <p>In light of recent developments in police investigations against <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Produce X 101</b>', '<b>Produce 48</b>', and more, project group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/x1">X1</a> of 'Produce X 101' will reportedly resume with their upcoming schedule as planned. </p>
      <p>On November 7, a rep from X1's side cautiously told media outlets, <i>"</i><i>Currently there are no changes to X1's scheduled attendance at the '<b>2019 V Live Awards V Heartbeat</b>'."</i></p>
      <p>The '2019 V Live Awards V Heartbeat' is set to take place this November 16 at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. Other attending artists include <b>GOT7</b>, <b>Stray Kids</b>, <b>CIX</b>, <b>AB6IX</b>, <b>ITZY</b>, <b>TOMORROW x TOGETHER</b>, and more. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile back on November 5, the court approved police's arrest warrants against <b>Ahn Joon Young </b>PD and <b>Kim Yong Bum</b> CP of Mnet's 'Produce' series, for charges of fraud including vote rigging. Ahn Joon Young PD has allegedly admitted to rigging vote results for 'Produce X 101' and 'Produce 48', but not 'Produce 101' seasons 1 or 2. </p>
