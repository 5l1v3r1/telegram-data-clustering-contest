      <h1>Real Betis back boss Rubi ahead of Sunday's crunch Seville derby</h1>
      <h2>The coach is under pressure following a tough start to the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:08:50+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author">SPORT.es</a></address>
      <p>Real Betis have picked up four points in their last two games to ease the pressure on Rubi going into Sunday's derby against Sevilla.</p>
      <p>Betis, who beat Celta Vigo and then drew with Real Madrid, go into the derby with the coaching staff, the board and the players all rowing in the same direction.</p>
      <p>Ángel Haro and José Miguel López Catalán, the club's president and vice president, were present at Thursday's training session which was behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Their presence was to offer their support to Rubi, who has been questioned following his summer move from Espanyol amid poor results.</p>
      <p>However, the win against Celta -- when the players made it clear they backed their boss -- and the draw with Madrid have eased the pressure on Rubi.</p>
