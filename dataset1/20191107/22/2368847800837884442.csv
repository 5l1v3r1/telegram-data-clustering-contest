智利警方也傳濫暴 總統聲明:暴警須受嚴懲

07 Nov 2019, 22:53

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月08日訊】智利爆發反政府示威運動已持續了3週，期間爆發多起流血衝突事件，已有23人在衝突中喪生。其中不乏有警員爛暴的現象出現。對此，智利總統皮涅拉（Sebastian Pinera）11月7日公開表示，對警方暴行無須隱瞞，要讓濫暴的警員跟暴徒同樣受到法律的嚴懲。
綜合外媒報導，皮涅拉（Sebastian Pinera）7日公開表示，政府對警員濫暴的數據完全透明化，政府不會隱瞞警方濫暴的情況，濫暴的警員將為他們的行為承擔罪責。
皮涅拉表示，在任何情況下，都必須完全尊重人權，武裝部隊務必遵守國際使用武力的規定，犯有虐待行為的軍警，與故意採取暴力行為的示威者一樣需受到嚴懲。
事實上迄今為止，智利檢察官已前後起訴了14名警員，智利獨立國家人權研究所（Chile ‘s independent National Human Rights Institute）也針對181起案件提起法律訴訟。
相比較之下，香港反送中運動持續4個多月的時間裏，不斷傳出港警的各種濫用武力的暴行，甚至在眾目睽睽之下發射布袋彈或橡膠子彈將一名女救護人員和一名女記者的眼睛打傷致失明，但港府卻一直拒絕成立獨立調查委員會對警方濫用暴力的案件進行審查，因此許多港人感嘆，香港警方和政府都已經完全被中共赤化變異得面目全非了。
