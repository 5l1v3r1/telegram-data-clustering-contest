【兆元風電商機4】選前風電股漲很大還能買？法人兩句話教你進出
07 Nov 2019, 22:05 by 鄧麗萍
選前倒數六十多天，面對漲多的風力發電族群，投資達人建議，現階段應避開股價已反映未來獲利的個股，並密切留意各家供應商的動向，慎選有新訂單和實質業績的公司，搭配選前政策利多行情，賺短線波段財。
過去一年，風電概念股可說市場火紅題材，曾有兩波大漲行情，首先是去年4月離岸風電遴選，另一次是8月下旬與廠商簽約之時，例如世紀鋼去年就暴漲約7倍，不過專家認為，目前資金行情延燒，加上選前政策利多，買風電股仍有獲利機會。
「投資人應趁著風電題材降溫時，再逢低承接。」前10大持股有2檔風電股、今年來績效逾32%的群益中小型股基金經理人吳胤良指出，「更重要的是，要慎選真正有機會切入風電產業的廠商。」他也提醒說，離岸風場剛開始施作，往往不會那麼順利，投資人應研判是長期問題或是短期因素所造成。
早在2014年即留意及研究風電產業，並於2016年世紀鋼股價10元附近就開始布局，曾持有4100多張世紀鋼的股市中實戶林適中，提出對於風電發展的最新看法，他說，「風電產業開始進入收成階段，如果政府很積極要推動本土化、國產化，今年底以前應該要看到更多訂單合約。總之，供應商的動向值得密切留意，因為有訂單才能實現業績。」
林適中指出，上緯投控去年曾漲到150元，世紀綱、華城和台船等股價也都有表現，「到現在，很多股票被市場烘抬之後又回到原點，甚至比起漲時更低，顯示出各業者的風電實質受惠程度。」他因此建議，現階段應避開股價已反映未來獲利的個股。
法人認為，風電股雖然已先漲一波，但接單仍是進行式，可注意一些持續有簽下新合約的風電股。例如台船與比利時DEME Offshore合資的轉投資公司台船環海風電工程，最近簽訂台灣首宗大型統包工程計畫優先承攬商合約，市場預估合作計畫超過10億美金，可為台船未來營運增溫。
另外像是華城，原本已手握3座離岸風力示範風機訂單，今年又拿下海能（FORMOSA 2）變電站及陸域電力系統統包工程，預計2021年商轉，未來2年可望挹注營運。
華城電機董事長許邦福就透露，6月取得台電第1期離岸風電工程21部日立風機塔內變壓器、電力模組等設備訂單。張捷指出，「華城今年上半年獲利已賺贏去年，台汽電也是如此，股價漲幅還不算大，成長性可期。」
第一金投顧董事長陳奕光表示，風電概念股具有政策利多，操作心法是「買在選前，賺在選前。」由於選舉前股價會發動一波，等到真正獲利出來時，股價反而會下跌，就像營建業採完工比例法認列，投資必須反過來操作。「另外在選後謝票時，股價也會動一下。」

[Zhaoyuan wind power business opportunity 4] Before the election, the wind power stocks rose a lot and could buy? The legal person teaches you in and out two sentences
07 Nov 2019, 22:05 by Deng Liping
Countdown to more than 60 days before the election, in the face of rising wind power generation groups, investment experts suggest that at this stage should avoid stocks that have reflected the future profit, and pay close attention to the trends of various suppliers, carefully choose new The company with orders and real performance, with the pre-election policy and the bullish market, earn short-term band money.
In the past year, wind power concept stocks can be said to have a hot market theme. There have been two surges in the market. First, offshore wind power selection in April last year, and another time when companies signed contracts with manufacturers in late August. For example, Century Steel surged last year. 7 times, but experts believe that the current fund market is burning, coupled with the pre-election policy, the purchase of wind power stocks still have profit opportunities.
""Investors should take advantage of the wind power theme to cool down, and then take the bargain-hunting."" The top 10 holdings have two wind power stocks, and this year's performance of more than 32% of the group's small and medium-sized stock fund manager Wu Yuliang pointed out, ""More It is important to carefully select the manufacturers who really have the opportunity to cut into the wind power industry.” He also warned that the offshore wind farms are not starting to work very often, and investors should judge whether they are long-term problems or short-term factors. .
As early as 2014, we paid attention to and researched the wind power industry. In 2016, Century Steel's stock price was around 10 yuan. It has held more than 4,100 Century Steel's stock market members, and proposed the latest views on wind power development. Said, ""The wind power industry is beginning to enter the harvest stage. If the government is actively promoting localization and localization, more orders should be seen before the end of this year. In short, the trend of suppliers is worth paying close attention to because of the order to achieve results. .""
Lin Shizhong pointed out that Shangwei’s investment control rose to 150 yuan last year, and the stock prices of Century Gang, Hwaseong and Taiwan Ships also performed. “Today, many stocks have been battered by the market and then returned to the original point, even compared to The rise is lower, showing the extent to which the wind power of the various industries is actually benefiting."" He therefore suggested that at this stage, stocks that have already reflected the future profitability should be avoided.
The legal person believes that although the wind power stocks have risen first, but the orders are still in progress, you can pay attention to some wind power stocks that continue to sign new contracts. For example, Taiwanese ship and the Dutch DEME Offshore joint venture investment company Taiwan ship wind and sea wind power project, recently signed Taiwan's first large-scale turnkey project priority contractor contract, the market estimated cooperation plan more than 1 billion US dollars, can be the future of Taiwan ship Operational temperature increase.
In addition, like Huacheng, it has already held orders for three offshore wind demonstration fans. This year, it won the FORNOSA 2 substation and land power system turnkey project. It is expected to be converted in 2021 and will be expected in the next 2 years. Operation.
Xu Bangfu, chairman of Hwaseong Electric, revealed that in June, he obtained orders for 21 transformers, power modules and other equipment in the Hitachi wind turbine tower of the first offshore wind power project of Taipower. Zhang Jie pointed out that ""Hangcheng has made a profit in the first half of this year and won last year. The same is true for Taiwan's auto power. The stock price increase is not large, and growth can be expected.""
Chen Shuguang, the chairman of the first gold investment company, said that the wind power concept stocks have a lot of policy, and the operating principle is ""buy before the election, earning before the election."" Since the stock price will start a wave before the election, when the real profit comes out, the stock price On the contrary, it will fall. Just like the construction industry adopts the proportion method, the investment must be reversed. ""In addition, when the vote is selected, the stock price will also move.""
