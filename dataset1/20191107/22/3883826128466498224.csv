The first match starts in Whangarei on Tuesday (22:00 GMT on Monday).

England's Test specialists arrived in Auckland this week and will travel to Whangarei on Monday with the rest of the squad and management.
New Zealand hold a 2-1 series lead before the fourth Twenty20 international in Napier on Friday (05:00 GMT).
