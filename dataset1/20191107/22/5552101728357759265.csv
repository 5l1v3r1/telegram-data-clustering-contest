【明星推手賺基金】採訪後記：演藝圈中穿上冒險放膽投資的人
07 Nov 2019, 22:57 by 劉以親, 王均峰
約訪倪良瑋之前，早已與他通過幾次電話，「小瑋哥，我想約訪你們家藝人！」「你旗下有沒有藝人很會投資理財？」也許是還不熟、聯絡頻率不高，他沒有露餡自己就是基金達人。後來，無意間發現小瑋哥其實是理財高手，立馬遞出訪綱，當下真有股相見恨晚的感覺。



「我1976年次，很老了耶！」雖然倪良瑋在電話那頭這樣說，但見面採訪那天，我們一行人都驚訝他看起來比實際年齡43歲要來得小，還私下聊了他皮膚好。
「小瑋哥，你全名怎麼寫啊？」「倪匡的『倪』……」眼前這位忙於藝人大小事務的王牌經紀人，難得坐下來聊自己，從個人生活到理財規劃，幾乎有問必答，讓人得以一窺他的理財配置。
剛出社會時的倪良瑋，曾經也是賺多少花多少的月光族，雖然處在光鮮亮麗的演藝圈打拚，但危機感讓他開始認真理財，起初投資股票賠錢，他便改買基金，而且理出一套養基金的心法。「我是未雨綢繆型的，會擔心如果有一天退休或者去天堂了，得留給家人一些東西。」所以，房子、保單也老早幫自己和家人都備好了。
「我買基金通常停利點要求20%以上，而且只停利不停扣，算是膽大。」倪良瑋敢放膽的原因在於資產配置，而且用閒錢投資，就算市場震盪也不影響生活，進可攻退可守。
採訪結束，我一直想起被封為日本國民奶奶的女演員樹木希林，她曾幫百貨公司代言講過一句廣告詞：「年齢を脱ぐ、冒険を着る」（脫掉年紀、穿上冒險），人生不也如此嗎？活到100歲的人生，越來越可能發生，這樣想想，理財更重要了，最好要像43歲的倪良瑋這般，做好資產配置，用閒錢投資。
幾個禮拜前，瑞士信貸亞太區董事總經理陶冬才示警：「如果把錢放在銀行，會死無葬身之地。」話說得嚇人，用意在強調負利率的可怕，這一刻聽來，不管你幾歲，都該脫掉年紀、做好配置、冒險投資。

[Star Pushing Earnings Fund] Interview: After putting on the adventure and investing in the entertainment circle
07 Nov 2019, 22:57 by Liu Yiqin, Wang Junfeng
Before I visited Ni Liangzhu, I had already called him several times. ""Little brother, I want to visit your artist!"" ""Do you have any artists who will invest in financial management?"" Perhaps it is still unfamiliar and the frequency of contact is not high. He didn't show himself that he was a fund. Later, it was unintentionally discovered that Xiao Xiao Ge was actually a wealth management expert. He immediately handed in a visit to the program, and now there is a feeling of hatefulness.



""I was 1976, very old!"" Although Ni Liangxi said this on the phone, but on the day of the interview, our group was surprised that he looked smaller than the actual age of 43 and talked privately about his skin. .
""Little brother, how do you write your full name?"" ""Ni Hao's ""Ni""..."" The ace agent who is busy with the artist's affairs, rarely sat down to talk about himself, from personal life to financial planning, almost asked Must answer, let people have a glimpse of his financial allocation.
When he first came out of the society, Ni Liangzhu, who used to earn a lot of money, was playing in the glamorous entertainment circle, but the sense of crisis made him start earnest financial management. When he initially invested in stocks to lose money, he changed the fund and decided to buy it. A set of fund management methods. ""I am a rainy day. I am worried that if I retire one day or go to heaven, I have to leave something to my family."" Therefore, the house and the insurance policy have been prepared for myself and my family.
""I usually buy a fund that requires more than 20% of the moratorium, and it is only daring to stop the moratorium."" Ni Lianghao dares to blame because of asset allocation, and investing with idle money, even if the market shock does not affect life, Attack and retreat can be defended.
At the end of the interview, I always remembered the actress Shulin, who was named a Japanese national grandma. She once helped the department store to speak an advert: ""A young man is arrogant and arrogant"" (getting out of age, putting on adventure), life Not the same? Life that is 100 years old is more and more likely to happen. Think about it, financial management is more important. It is best to do asset allocation and invest with spare cash, like the 43-year-old Ni Liangzhu.
A few weeks ago, Tao Dongcai, the managing director of Credit Suisse Asia Pacific, warned: ""If you put money in the bank, you will die without a place to die."" The words are scary, and the intention is to emphasize the terrible negative interest rate. At this moment, no matter how many you When you are old, you should take off your age, make a good job, and invest in it.
