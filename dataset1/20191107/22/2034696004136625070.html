        <b>Oh wow!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The original storyline for Carrie Fisher’s Leia in <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/star-wars-episode-9-release-date-trailer-1961269"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a> has been revealed <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/carrie-fisher-dies-aged-60-1924550">three years after the actress’ untimely death</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Carrie’s brother, Todd, claimed that his sister – who portrays General Leia Organa in the sequel trilogy films (posthumously so in the upcoming final instalment <i>The Rise of Skywalker) </i>– was supposed to be the “last Jedi” rather than her brother Luke Skywalker.</p>
      <p>“She was going to be the big payoff in the final film,” Fisher told <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/details-of-carrie-fishers-rise-of-skywalker-role-revealed-210514180.html"><i>Yahoo Entertainment</i></a>. “She was going to be the last Jedi, so to speak. That’s cool right?”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jj-abrams-discusses-using-carrie-fisher-footage-star-wars-episode-ix-2491122">He went on to address the decision made by the creators of <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> to use unused footage of Carrie as Leia</a>. “The truth is that JJ Abrams was great friends with Carrie… he had an extraordinary sense of love for her,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They had eight minutes of footage. They grabbed every frame and analysed it… and then reverse-engineered it and [got] it into the story the right way. It’s kind of magical.”</p>
      <p>He added: “This is, in its own way, a payoff. … It’s Carrie talking to us all from beyond. The beautiful thing about the concept of the Force is that there is no real death; you just exist in another dimension.</p>
      <p>“So Carrie is looking down or sideways or wherever and is still part of us. To be able to see that — it’s magical stuff only in the movies.”</p>

      <p>In other news, box office figures for the opening weekend of <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> are projected to be the lowest of the current trilogy.</p>
      <p>Despite tickets for the first screenings of the final part of the sequel trilogy in the US outselling Avengers: Endgame in the first hour of pre-sales, according to Box Office Pro, it is projected to rake in $200 million on its opening weekend.</p>
      <p>That would make <i>The Rise of Skywalker’s</i> opening weekend the the lowest-performing of the sequel trilogy. Comparatively, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/reviews-various-artists-16360"><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i></a> (2015) opened to $247.9 million while <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/star-wars-last-jedi-film-review"><i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i></a> opened to $220 million.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> has a release date of December 19 in the UK and Friday, December 20 in the US.</p>
