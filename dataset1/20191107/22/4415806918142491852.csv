All 39 people found dead in the back of a lorry in England last month have now been formally identified, police has said.
Essex Police said a series of files had been brought before an identification commission with the assistance of Vietnamese police.
Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray has now formally identified all of the victims and their families have been notified.
Mrs Beasley Murray said: “May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims’ families.”
All of the deceased were Vietnamese nationals, a spokesman for Essex Police said.
Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith, who is leading the investigation, said: “This is an important step in the investigation and enables us to work with our Vietnamese police colleagues to support the families of those victims.
“It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.
“Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.”
Vietnam sent a delegation of officials to the UK earlier this week to assist with the investigation.
