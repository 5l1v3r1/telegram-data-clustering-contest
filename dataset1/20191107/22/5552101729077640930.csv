【兆元風電商機2】接單國際風電大廠　23家材料供應商最吸金
07 Nov 2019, 22:05 by 鄧麗萍
政府大力扶持離岸風電產業，並打造本土化供應鏈，冀望借助國外廠商的經驗、能力和資金，為一些傳產公司，包括鋼鐵、造船、水泥、樹脂等帶來新的業務，沾上風電利多的個股也應聲大漲。
「政府積極推動綠能，產業有這個需求，尤其國際企業都很重視綠電供應鏈。」前10大持股有2檔風電股、今年來績效逾32%的群益中小型股基金經理人吳胤良指出，全球再生能源是不可逆的產業趨勢，不管是哪個政黨執政，都將持續推動風力發電。
經濟部預估，離岸風電產值逾9,000億元，超過20家本土供應商受惠。經濟部工業局的報告指出：「整個本土產業鏈中，水下基礎設施、塔架與海纜，預期將成為貢獻產值最高的產業別。」
「建立離岸風場需要投入很多錢，並非本土廠商有能力單獨完成的。」吳胤良指出，透過國產化政策，可借助國外廠商的經驗、能力和資金，為一些傳產公司，包括鋼鐵、造船、水泥、樹脂等帶來新的業務。
吳胤良觀察，全球的風力發電產業正在恢復成長，包括歐洲、美國持續啟動風機建置外，中國也出現搶建潮。「一些國內零件廠本來就是西門子、Vestas等風機大廠的供應商，未來若能拿到國外風廠如越南和日本的訂單，就有機會擴大出口、增加業績。」
有「產業隊長」稱號的台股達人張捷表示，目前台灣風電產業供應鏈以上游製造業為主，產值以零組件為最大宗，「以製造塔架與水下基礎的世紀鋼、葉片樹脂的上緯投控、承攬陸上變電工程的台汽電等，貢獻產值最高。」
「距離選舉剩下60、70天，各大政黨都會針對能源政策積極發表政見，而風電的發展會比太陽能來得快。」第一金投顧董事長陳奕光認為，大選倒數計時，在政策利多題材帶動下，供應風機零件的公司可望有不錯的表現，包括世紀鋼、上緯、永冠等。

[Zhaoyuan Wind Power Business Opportunity 2] Ordering International Wind Power Factory 23 material suppliers are the most absorbing gold
07 Nov 2019, 22:05 by Deng Liping
The government has vigorously supported the offshore wind power industry and built a localized supply chain. With the experience, capabilities and capital of foreign manufacturers, the government has brought new business to some of the transmission companies, including steel, shipbuilding, cement and resin. The stocks of wind power and bullish stocks also rose.
""The government is actively promoting green energy. The industry has this demand. In particular, international companies attach great importance to the green power supply chain."" The top 10 holdings have two wind power stocks, and this year's performance of more than 32% of the group's small and medium-sized stock fund managers Wu Yuliang pointed out that global renewable energy is an irreversible industrial trend, and no matter which party is in power, it will continue to promote wind power.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs estimates that offshore wind power output value exceeds 900 billion yuan, benefiting more than 20 local suppliers. According to the report of the Industrial Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: ""Under the local industrial chain, underwater infrastructure, towers and submarine cables are expected to be the industries with the highest output value.""
""The establishment of an offshore wind farm requires a lot of money, and it is not the ability of local manufacturers to do it alone."" Wu Yiliang pointed out that through the localization policy, the experience, capabilities and funds of foreign manufacturers can be used for some of the mid-production companies, including Steel, shipbuilding, cement, and resins bring new business.
Wu Yuliang observed that the global wind power industry is recovering, including Europe and the United States continue to launch wind turbines, and China has also seen a wave of construction. ""Some domestic parts factories are originally suppliers of wind turbines such as Siemens and Vestas. If they can get orders from foreign wind factories such as Vietnam and Japan in the future, they will have the opportunity to expand exports and increase their performance.""
Zhang Jie, a Taiwanese company leader with the title of ""Industry Captain"", said that the current wind power industry supply chain in Taiwan is dominated by upstream manufacturing, and the output value is the largest component. ""To make towers and underwater foundations of Century Steel and Blade Resin The output of the Shangwei and the Taiwan-based steam power plant that undertakes the onshore substation project have contributed the highest output value.""
""There are 60 or 70 days left until the election. All major political parties will actively express political views on energy policy, and the development of wind power will be faster than solar energy."" Chen Yinguang, chairman of the first gold investment, believes that the countdown to the election is in the theme of policy Driven by the company, the supply of fan parts is expected to have good performance, including Century Steel, Shangwei, Yongguan and so on.
