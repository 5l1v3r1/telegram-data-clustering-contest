      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:07:02+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>The trailer of Ashutosh Gowarikar's one of the ambitious projects, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Panipat'">'Panipat'</a> has been dropped over the internet recently. It has received a lot of appreciation and love from the audience as well as other <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> celebs.</p>
      <p>In the film, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a> will be portraying the role of Peshwa Sadashiv Rao Bhau while <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a> will be seen as Parvati Bai. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a> will essay the character of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ahmad-Shah-Abdali">Ahmad Shah Abdali</a>, an Afghan ruler. Baba's fans have hailed him for the portrayal of Abdali.</p>
      <p>And now we hear that it also caught Afghanistan's attention. According to a report, the Afghanistan embassy feels that Ashutosh's film might portray Abdali's character in a bad light. And hence, they have written to the ministry of information and broadcasting regarding their concerns.</p>
      <p>In the letter written to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/prakash-javadekar">Prakash Javadekar</a>, the embassy stated that distorted depiction of the Afghan ruler might hurt the sentiments of the citizens of Afghanistan. Which will also affect between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Also, former Afghanistan Ambassador to India Dr Shaida Abdali tweeted his concerns. He wrote, "Dear @duttsanjay Ji: Historically, the Indian cinema has been extremely instrumental in strengthening the Indo-Afghan ties - I very much hope that the film "Panipat" has kept that fact in mind while dealing with this important episode of our shared history."</p>
