      <p>It was said that Jimmy Garoppolo was attempting to hit on FOX reporter Erin Andrews during a postgame interview last Thursday night, but the 49ers quarterback strongly denies doing so.</p>
      <p>Jimmy G was asked about how he felt regarding the team’s win over the Seahawks on “Thursday Night Football,” and he was pumped about it in his postgame interview.</p>
      <p>“Feels great, baby,” Garoppolo told Andrews.</p>

      <p>Garoppolo heard some criticism for his use of “baby,” as that’s just the world we live in nowadays. He downplayed it, though, saying he uses that word all the time.</p>
      <p>“I say baby like 500 times a game to my teammates and stuff. It wasn’t like that,” he explained.</p>

      <p>We side with Jimmy G here. The “baby” talk was overblown.</p>
