      <p>Antalya - <b>Matthias Schwab</b> and<b> Tom Lewis</b> shared the lead after the first round of the <b>Turkish Open</b> on Thursday with hat-trick seeker <b>Justin Rose</b> handily placed.</p>
      <p>Three late birdies helped Olympic champion Rose sign for a five-under-par 67, two shots off his fellow Englishman Lewis and Schwab of Austria.</p>
      <p>Ryder Cup winners Alex Noren and Thomas Pieters were tied for third with American David Lipsky on 66.</p>
      <p>"I guess it's job done," said the 39-year-old former world number one Rose, who could join a select group of Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam and Colin Montgomerie as the only players to win a regular European Tour event three years in a row.</p>
      <p>"The hot finish was exactly what we needed. I was aware of the leaderboard. Obviously it was a perfect day to play golf as it normally is here in Turkey and I could see the lads going low."</p>
      <p>Schwab, 24, is seeking his European Tour breakthrough after nine top-10 finishes this season.</p>
      <p>"I'm just trying to give it my best," he said.</p>
      <p>"Every time I tee it up, it seems to be working well the last few months but I have no recipe."</p>
