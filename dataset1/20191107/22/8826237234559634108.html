      <h1>Maine Lobsterman Reels In Unusual Catch: A Live Deer</h1>

      <p>(HARRINGTON, Maine) — A Maine lobsterman hauled in an unusual catch 5 miles off the coast — a live deer.</p>
      <p>Ren Dorr says he was setting traps when he saw a young deer Monday morning. He says the deer had given up swimming and was being carried farther offshore.</p>
      <p>He and his crew hauled the 100-pound buck aboard.</p>
      <p>Having a wild animal in a confined space could be trouble. But Dorr told the<i> Bangor Daily News</i> that the deer was so tuckered out that he “laid right down like a dog.” He says it took a half-hour to return to Harrington, where the deer was set free.</p>
      <p>Dorr says that he has seen deer swimming before but that this was different.</p>
      <p>He says that if he and his crew hadn’t intervened, the deer would have been “a goner.”</p>
