【「玩」掉焦慮（中）】強化動機和參與感　「遊戲化」成心理治療神器
07 Nov 2019, 22:11 by 查修傑
在「個人禪修」（Personal Zen）這支手機app裡，玩家不須要頓悟，而是得緊盯著畫面上不斷飛舞的負面情緒（生氣臉）和正面情緒（快樂臉），想辦法用最快速度撿起快樂臉撒下的星芒，同時避開生氣臉，最後就能獲得彩色寶石和勳章，此時畫面的色調也會隨著玩家的分數增加，逐漸從灰暗，轉變為「彩色」。
當然，骨灰級的電玩玩家看到這種「無害」的遊戲內容，多半會翻白眼、嗤之以鼻；而對於焦慮症的患者來說，光靠遊戲就能治病，如此天馬行空的想法一時間恐怕也很難接受。美國新聞網站Vox的記者為了實地了解這些「抗焦慮app」的效果，親自下載軟體試用，拿自己當實驗品，結果出乎她意料之外。
剛開始，當螢幕上出現「繼續，你一定可以的！」、「你已經連續XX天達成冥想任務，太棒了！」諸如此此類打氣字眼，記者只覺得幼稚可笑；但奇怪的是，玩了幾天下來，她開始不由自主地拿起手機，檢查每天的「例行功課」；過了一段時間，她發現透過app給予的關卡任務，自己竟養成每天定時散步的習慣，同時逐漸減少了自我懷疑的負面心態。
而箇中奧妙，或許就如近年來許多研究所指出的，是受惠於「遊戲化」所帶來的「動機」與「投入」強化作用。
「動機」與「投入」可說是每一位想要吸引學生注意力的老師，或是企圖打開市場的行銷人員都急於追求的東西。要怎麼做，才能吸引對象的注意力，並持續地與你互動？近年來常見的熱門詞彙──「遊戲化」（gamification），雖然迄今缺乏公認的定義，但一般相信所謂的「遊戲化」就是將原本非遊戲的事物，額外附加上「遊戲機制」，藉以強化使用者參與和互動的意願；而其具體案例，從航空公司和信用卡業者的「積點」、「哩程」制度，到觀光景點常見的「蓋章」活動，都屬之。
而在數位經濟範疇內，不管是Uber鼓勵司機多開幾趟的獎勵機制、還是約會軟體Tinder引誘使用者不斷尋找對象的介面設計，都有著「遊戲化」的影子；而循此激勵法則，用以戲來抑制負面情緒的概念，似乎也就不再顯得那麼天馬行空，而是有著心理學的認知行為理論作為基礎。
心理學家認為，焦慮症患者最常面臨的障礙是：沒有足夠動機讓他們每天打起精神，完成醫生建議的心理療程。而「遊戲化」的作用，就是為那些療程加上「動機」和「樂趣」，令人想要一而再、再而三地「出任務」。
某種角度來說，有點像是替難吃的「心藥」加上糖衣，讓患者想吃，甚至愛吃。

[""Playing"" off anxiety (middle)] Strengthening motivation and participation Sense ""Game"" into a psychotherapeutic artifact
07 Nov 2019, 22:11 by Cha Xiujie
In the mobile app ""Personal Zen"", players don't need to be enlightened, but they have to keep an eye on the negative emotions (angry faces) and positive emotions (happy faces) that are constantly flying on the screen. Quickly pick up the starburst of the happy face, while avoiding the angry face, and finally get colored gemstones and medals. At this time, the color of the picture will increase with the player's score, and gradually change from dark to ""color"". .
Of course, ashes-level video game players will see this ""harmless"" game content, and most of them will turn their eyes and sneer; for patients with anxiety, the game can cure the disease, so the idea of being arrogant is also very time-consuming. Hard to accept. In order to understand the effects of these ""anti-anxiety apps"" on the spot, the reporters of the US news website Vox personally downloaded the software and tried to use them as experimental products. The results were unexpected.
At the beginning, when the screen appears ""Continue, you can!"", ""You have reached a meditation task for XX days in a row, great!"" Such a pumping word, the reporter only feels childish and ridiculous; but strangely, After playing for a few days, she began to pick up her mobile phone and check the daily routines. After a while, she found that through the level task given by the app, she developed the habit of walking regularly every day, and gradually reduced it. The negative mentality of self-doubt.
The mystery of the singularity, perhaps as pointed out by many research institutes in recent years, is to benefit from the ""motivation"" and ""input"" enhancements brought about by ""gamification"".
""Motivation"" and ""input"" can be said to be every teacher who wants to attract students' attention, or what the marketing staff who are trying to open the market are eager to pursue. What do you do to attract the attention of the subject and continue to interact with you? In recent years, the popular vocabulary, ""gamification"", although there is no known definition so far, it is generally believed that the so-called ""gamification"" is to add the ""game mechanism"" to the original non-games. The willingness of users to participate and interact; and its specific case, from the ""points"" and ""squatting"" systems of airlines and credit card operators to the ""seal"" activities common to sightseeing spots.
In the digital economy, whether Uber encourages drivers to open a few reward mechanisms, or the dating software Tinder entice users to constantly find the interface design of the object, there is a ""gamification"" shadow; and follow this incentive law, The concept of using drama to suppress negative emotions seems to be no longer so arrogant, but rather based on the cognitive behavioral theory of psychology.
Psychologists believe that the most common obstacles for patients with anxiety disorders are: there is not enough motivation for them to get up every day and complete the psychological treatment recommended by the doctor. The role of ""gamification"" is to add ""motivation"" and ""fun"" to those treatments. It is desirable to ""get out of the task"" again and again.
In a certain way, it is a bit like a ""heart medicine"" plus a sugar coat for the patient to eat, even to eat.
