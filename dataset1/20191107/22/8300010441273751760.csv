But their house was filled with love. And in 2004, Tiffany felt compelled to create a safe space for kids in need.She made the decision to become a foster mom, taking in five boys - four of them brothers who had been separated across the county.""As I got to know the boys I got attached to them and they just became like my own children,"" she said.Two of her sons suffer from mental illnesses.""The challenges escalated to a higher level than I could have ever imagined. But through it all, we made it and the kids are grown and well now. So I'm grateful for that,"" she said.Friends and co-workers who know Tiffany best say she is the most giving person they know. And this time, they're happy to see her on the receiving end as a Mathis Brothers Pay It Forward finalist.""I'm older than she is but I look up to her. I admire her for her strength, the courage and her ability to make things happen in her life and for other people,"" said Tiffany's friend and co-worker, Toni Babers.""Sometimes even when I go back and look at my life, myself it's amazing to me. So I'm very grateful that someone else sees the beauty in what I've done,"" Tiffany said.Being a mother and raising seven boys who are now happy, successful young men, she says, has been her life's greatest accomplishment.""Children that need just the basics in life, being a solid foundation, stability, love and nurturing and if I'm in a position to be able to render that to children in need, by all means I would jump at the chance to do that again,"" she said.Smith is one of three ""Pay It Forward"" finalists announced this week leading up to Friday's big reveal.
