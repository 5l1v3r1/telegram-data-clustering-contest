      <h1>Baby 'dies 12 times' as mum gives birth early after falling pregnant on the coil</h1>
      <h2>Sammi Love, who is from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, described little Eidy as "a miracle baby" after falling pregnant while using contraception</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:38:44+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:38</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Hayley Parker, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A mum who fell <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pregnancy">pregnant</a> on the coil told how her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/miracle-babies">miracle baby</a> "died 12 times" after his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/giving-birth">birth</a> .</p>
      <p>Sammi Love, 31, had the coil fitted four months before little Eidy was conceived with her partner of two years, Carl Riley.</p>
      <p>And the device caused her to go into early labour by causing her waters to break, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/my-baby-died-12-times-3509246">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a> says.</p>
      <p>Eidy was born weighing just 1lb 6oz - the same size as a Samsung S10 - at 25 weeks in hospital.</p>
      <p>The baby enduring around a dozen near death experiences, with Sammi by her side on five of those occasions.</p>
      <p>But now aged nine months, the baby has beaten tiny odds to join her siblings at home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.</p>

      <p>"Eidy's a coil baby, I wasn't expecting her. I only did a pregnancy test because I was feeling unwell, I was sick and tired," Sammi said.</p>
      <p>"I thought that was the first thing the GP would ask me, even though it was next to impossible.</p>
      <p>"When the test came up positive, I was more than a little bit shocked. I was about six weeks' pregnant.</p>
      <p>"Eidy is my fourth and final baby. But we decided if she could beat the coil, she was obviously meant to be."</p>
      <p>When she fell pregnant, Sammi was already mum to Ryan, aged 13, Zakk, aged nine, and Ebon, aged eight, with her ex-husband.</p>

      <p>The former waitress, who worked in a tea room until Eidy came home from hospital, was told her due date was May 25 this year - but ended up giving birth on February 12.</p>
      <p>She said: "Because the coil was so close to her, there was a risk taking it out could cause miscarriage.</p>
      <p>"The pregnancy was absolutely awful. I was really sick and had to be off work for six weeks at one point.</p>
      <p>"I only stopped being sick at 23 weeks, then my waters broke at 24. The coil had ruptured the membrane (pricked the amniotic sack).</p>
      <p>"I was at home when it happened, I'd been at work during the day and my sister came round for tea with the kids, which was homemade soup.</p>
      <p>"She left about 7.30pm and I had backache so I sat down on the sofa, then I said 'Karl, I can't get up'. I thought I'd wet myself at first.</p>

      <p>"I had C-sections with all the boys because I've had a hip replacement, so I rang my sister and said 'what's it like when your waters break?' but she'd had a C-section too.</p>
      <p>"I rang my mum, who said to call the hospital, and they told me to put a pad on and lie on my left-hand side for half an hour.</p>
      <p>"But it was obvious by then my waters had broken, so I went straight into Royal Stoke University Hospital.</p>
      <p>"We went to the Medical Assessment Unit and, as I was having an internal examination, the doctor asked the nurse if my baby was alive. Luckily she was fine."</p>
      <p>Sammi was moved hospital and gave birth four days later.</p>
      <p>"I was miles away from home so I wasn’t getting any visitors although Carl stayed with me, he works at a builders' merchant but they were really good about it," the mum-of-four added.</p>

      <p>"At 11.30am that day, I started getting contractions. They didn't think I was in labour as I wasn't dilating, they said my uterus was just stressed.</p>
      <p>"At 3am on Tuesday, I asked the nurse for some pain relief and she said to wait for the doctor's ward round at 6am. I had Eidy at 6.05.</p>
      <p>"Carl was asleep on the chair but I woke him and said 'you need to help me get my leggings off', then 'go get the midwife'.</p>
      <p>"By the time they came back into the room, I had Eidy in my hands. She was very impatient. I'd gone from not dilating at all, to having a baby on the bed in the ward.</p>
      <p>"The coil came out with her. The midwife picked it up and said 'do you want this?' I said 'I never want to see that again in my life'."</p>
      <p>Sammi added: "She was the same size as my Samsung S10 phone, she was tiny. They don’t measure premmies anymore, but they estimated her at 10.5 inches.</p>
      <p>"She came out crying, which was a good sign, then they took her down to intensive care for an assessment.</p>

      <p>"It was six hours before we got to see her, it was very surreal.</p>
      <p>"Even now I'm numb to it until I think 'my baby could have been dead'. If she wasn't over a certain weight or hadn't shown signs of life, they wouldn't have intervened.</p>
      <p>"We were initially told her survival rate was just 15 per cent. When she came out, she looked great and was breathing on her own, but within 48 hours she'd had a drop.</p>
      <p>"She also got <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> at seven days old, and we were questioned about what we wanted to do.</p>
      <p>"She had what I call a code blue. Her heartbeat dropped to four beats a minute. All I could think was 'if she dies, she's going to want her mum'.</p>
      <p>"Eidy was re-ventilated five times in total. She was really good with apnoea, that was her party trick.</p>
      <p>"She’d get sent into the final room at special care, then she’d go blue and end up back in intensive care, because she’d have to be resuscitated.</p>
      <p>"I've watched her die five times, I wasn't there for the others. It was about a dozen times in total."</p>

      <p>Eidy, who will be nine months old next week, now feeds through a peg fed into her stomach - because she's developed oral aversion from being ventilated.</p>
      <p>Sammi said: "She was in hospital for 128 days, 19 weeks, and was on a ventilator for seven weeks.</p>
      <p>"It was awful, now I look back on it. At the time, you're numb and living in the moment.</p>
      <p>"You can't think about it too much, because it can break you. You’ve got to be OK for your baby.</p>
      <p>"Everything can change so fast with a premature baby. They can be fine in the morning and fighting for their life by the evening."</p>
      <p>Eidy came home for four weeks on June 19, but ended up back in hospital for 10 weeks with her feeding issues.</p>
      <p>Sammi said: "She only came out properly four weeks ago. She's still tiny, she was weighed last week and she was only 12lb 12oz. She wears nought to three-month clothes."</p>
