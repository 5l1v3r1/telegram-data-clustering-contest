      <p>A soundbar can provide some of the best sound you'll ever get for home audio, and this one from Samsung is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> right now for pretty cheap.</p>
      <p>How cheap? $278. That might not sound like a low price, but it is. The retail cost of the soundbar is $499.99, so this price drop is bringing it down by $222.</p>
      <p>It's even more of a value because it's not just the soundbar you're getting. You <i>also </i>get a wireless sub woofer to go with it. The two are a package deal, and after setting them up the soundbar gives off crisp, clear sound while the sub brings in some nice bass.</p>
