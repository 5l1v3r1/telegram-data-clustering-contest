She was born on May 15, 1923 in Milwaukee, Wis., to Peter and Carolina (Carnera) Odorico from Sequals, Italy.
Tillie is survived by her children, Jim (Mary Jane) Schuchardt, Nancy (Jim) Entgelmeier and Bob (Ruth) Schuchardt; seven grandchildren, Michelle (Bill), Karen (Kevin), Sara (John), Jennie, Eric (Makayla), Cindy (Dennis) and Mike; and six great-grandchildren, Carson, Katelynn, Sophia, Torin, Emmett and Raquel, and one to arrive in April 2020.

She was happily married to her husband, Emmett, until his death on March 2, 2011. Tillie enjoyed her family, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.  One of her greatest joys was family gatherings at the house, and family visiting her at assisted living. A special memory of hers was returning to Sequals, Italy with her sisters, and visiting her homeland and relatives. She loved trips to Northern Wisconsin on Lake Nancy, bocce ball tournaments, sewing, flower arrangements and cross-stitch.
