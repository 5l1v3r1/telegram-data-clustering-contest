      <p>The stakeholder ministers of the National Broadband Network -- Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and Minister for Finance Mathias Cormann -- have announced the appointment of Kate McKenzie to the NBN board. <br/><br/>McKenzie is currently in the metaphorical CEO departure lounge of New Zealand broadband wholesaler Chorus after announcing in August she would <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chorus-ceo-kate-mckenzie-leaving-at-end-of-2019/">leave at the end of 2019</a>. <br/><br/>McKenzie took on the role in <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chorus-selects-former-telstra-coo-kate-mckenzie-as-ceo/">February 2017</a>, after <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/telstra-on-hunt-for-new-coo-as-kate-mckenzie-retires/">resigning as Telstra's COO</a> in July 2016. <br/><br/>She added at the time she was returning to Australia and did not intend to take on another executive role. <br/><br/>"Of course, my one regret is I'd love to take the fantastic Chorus fibre network back home with me, but yeah, that's probably not going to happen," McKenzie said at the time.</p>
      <p>As well as NBN, McKenzie also hold places on the boards of Allianz Australia and Stockland when she joins the Australian broadband wholesaler on December 1. <br/><br/>At the same time, the ministers also announced that Justin Milne and Patrick Flannigan would step down from the board at the expiration of their terms on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The pair <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackett-picked-for-nbn-co-board/">joined the NBN board</a> together in November 2013, alongside Internode founder Simon Hackett. Hackett was replaced by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/iinet-founder-michael-malone-appointed-to-nbn-board/">iiNet founder Michael Malone</a> in April 2016. <br/><br/>Flannigan was a former head of construction at NBN, while Milne was an ex-Telstra executive who had close ties to former Communications Minister cum Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. <br/><br/>As chair of MYOB, Milne oversaw the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/shareholders-approve-kkrs-au1-6b-myob-acquisition/">company's AU$1.6 billion acquisition</a> by private equity firm KKR &amp; Co. He was also chair of the ABC during the bumbled sacking of former ABC CEO Michelle Guthrie, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/06/abc-paid-michelle-guthrie-164m-after-she-was-sacked-as-managing-director">gained AU$1.64 million</a> from the national broadcaster after she was sacked.</p>
