【「玩」掉焦慮（下）】電玩是糖衣、療癒是目的　app限制遊戲時間防上癮
07 Nov 2019, 22:11 by 查修傑
根據美國娛樂軟體協會統計，有42%的美國人每星期至少會花3個小時在電玩上，而其中有四分之三是成年人，約四成四的玩家是女性。
SuperBetter的創作者Jane McGonigal曾自行做過一項統計：線上遊戲《魔獸世界》的全球玩家花在這套遊戲上的全部時間，如果通通加起來，相當於592萬年。McGonigal認為這些時間如果能夠透過「遊戲化」的設計，引導至現實世界的心理療癒和問題解決，所能夠釋放出來的效益將不可限量。
除了透過SuperBetter、Personal Zen這類app來對抗焦慮，學界也早已發現，其實不管任何類型的遊戲──從經典不敗的俄羅斯方塊到最新多人連線電玩──都能在焦慮症的治療上發揮奇效。
一個著名的例子是2006年的一項醫學實驗，研究人員讓112名準備接受外科手術的小朋友，在進入開刀房之前暢玩掌上型遊樂器，結果這些孩子的術前焦慮症狀竟大幅降低，效果甚至比服用抗焦慮藥物更為有效。
藉由攫取注意力來達成期待的效果，正是近年備受心理學界和科技業者重視的「認知吸引」（congnitive absorption）現象。但矛盾的是，就像社群網路一樣，使用者若對app成癮，投注了大量時間在遊戲上，犧牲和親人好友相處的時間，可能反而會增加焦慮感，不但無助改善病情，反而加速惡化。
「重點是，你不能在藥的外層添加太多糖衣，否則就適得其反，」矽谷另一家開發抗焦慮app的軟體公司創辦人Spencer Greenberg認為：「新創業者或許很難抵抗用戶黏著度的誘惑，因為那是股東最在意的數字；但你必須著眼長期效益：如果使用者沒有獲得（降低焦慮的）預期效果，黏著度再高也沒用。」
其他的抗焦慮app設計者，顯然也意識到了這一點。SuperBetter的任務設計方式就是讓使用者一天上線的時間控制在10分鐘左右：進行3次「能力強化」、完成一項任務，並擊退一名壞蛋。一旦任務達成，程式就停止累計分數，避免用戶為了追求高分而沉迷其中；Personal Zen的作者Dennis-Tiwary也強調其設計理念是取代一般人常在捷運或公車上玩的小遊戲，並不鼓勵用戶花太多時間在抗焦慮app上。
因為畢竟，當你推出的是一套號稱能夠療癒人心的app，就不能像唯利是圖的社群平台一樣，只以營利為目的。
「我們賣的是一種心理療法，所以絕不能變成江湖郎中；矽谷這裡已經有太多利用人性弱點來賺錢的公司，我們不能再同流合汙，」Dennis-Tiwary語重心長的說。

[""Play"" off anxiety (below)] Video game is sugar coating, healing is the purpose of app limit game time anti-addiction
07 Nov 2019, 22:11 by Cha Xiujie
According to the American Entertainment Software Association, 42% of Americans spend at least three hours a week on video games, and three-quarters of them are adults, and about four-fourths of them are women.
SuperBetter creator Jane McGonigal has done a statistic on his own: the global game ""World of Warcraft"" global players spent all the time on this set of games, if combined, it is equivalent to 5.92 million years. McGonigal believes that if these times can be guided to the real world of psychological healing and problem solving through ""gamification"" design, the benefits that can be released will be limitless.
In addition to anti-anxiety through apps like SuperBetter and Personal Zen, the academic community has long discovered that no matter what type of game – from classic unbeaten Tetris to the latest multiplayer video game – it can be used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Amazing.
A well-known example is a medical experiment in 2006. The researchers asked 112 children who were going to undergo surgery to play palm-sized game instruments before entering the knife room. As a result, the pre-operative anxiety symptoms of these children were greatly reduced. Even more effective than taking anti-anxiety drugs.
By taking attention and achieving the desired effect, it is the phenomenon of ""congnitive absorption"" that has attracted the attention of the psychology and technology industry in recent years. But the paradox is that, like the social network, users who are addicted to the app, bet a lot of time on the game, and sacrifice time with friends and family, may increase anxiety, not only help to improve the condition, Instead, it accelerated the deterioration.
""The point is that you can't add too many icings on the outer layer of the drug, otherwise it's counterproductive,"" says Spencer Greenberg, founder of another software company that develops anti-anxiety apps in Silicon Valley. ""New entrepreneurs may have a hard time resisting the temptation of user adhesion. Because that's the number that shareholders care most about; but you have to look at long-term benefits: if the user doesn't get the desired effect (lowering anxiety), the higher the adhesion is useless.""
Other anti-anxiety app designers are clearly aware of this. SuperBetter's task design method is to let the user control the time of the day to be around 10 minutes: 3 times of ""strengthening"", completing a task, and repelling a bad guy. Once the mission is reached, the program stops accumulating scores and prevents users from indulging in high scores. Personal Zen author Dennis-Tiwary also emphasizes that the design concept is to replace the small games that most people often play on the MRT or bus. Users spend too much time on anti-anxiety apps.
Because after all, when you launch a set of apps that claim to be healing people, you can't just use the profit-oriented community platform.
""We are selling a kind of psychotherapy, so we must not become a river and a lake. There are already too many companies in the valley to make money by using human weaknesses. We can no longer co-exist,"" Dennis-Tiwary said with a strong heart.
