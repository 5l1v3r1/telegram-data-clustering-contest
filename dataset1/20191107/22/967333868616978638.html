      <p>New York State Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla ordered Trump on Thursday to pay a stiff sum to a group of charities that claimed the Trump Foundation violated the state's charities laws.</p>
      <blockquote>"I direct Mr. Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence, on a pro rata basis to the Approved Recipients," Judge Scarpulla wrote.</blockquote>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed in June 2018 by the office of New York's then-attorney general, Barbara Underwood, over the issue of the Trump Foundation collecting political donations for Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, which she characterized as "extensive unlawful political coordination."</p>
      <blockquote>The foundation, which was being managed by Trump's children Donald, Jr. and Ivanka, has since dissolved itself under court supervision, and a stipulation of that agreement added last month provided for the distribution of the foundation's remaining assets to charities determined to have no connection to the Trump family.</blockquote>
      <p>Accordingly, the $2 million to be paid by the president himself, as well as the $1.78 million in foundation assets, will be distributed equally to eight charities: Army Emergency Relief, the Children’s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha’s Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of National Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.</p>
      <blockquote>New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a Thursday <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/ag-james-secures-court-order-against-donald-j-trump-trump-children-and-trump">press release</a> the ruling was a "major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain."</blockquote>
      <p>"No one is above the law - not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States," James said.</p>

      <p>The settlement agreement also imposes "a regime of restrictions" on Trump's future participation in the leadership of charities. "Any charity he joins as a director must have a majority of independent directors, must engage counsel with expertise in New York not-for-profit law, and must engage the services of an accounting firm to monitor and audit the organization’s grants and expenses," the press release notes. "If Mr. Trump forms a new charity, such an organization must comply with these requirements, and also report to the Office of the Attorney General for five years."</p>
      <p>​While the White House did not immediately respond, Trump has in the past characterized the case as politically motivated.</p>
