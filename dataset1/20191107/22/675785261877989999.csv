Gareth Southgate has warned James Maddison that he must be ­“high-performance, low-­maintenance” from now on following his casino own goal.
Maddison gambled his ­international career by being ­pictured in a casino while England played Czech ­Republic last month, after he left the squad through illness.
The Leicester midfielder has been named for Euro 2020 ­qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo even though there was no place for Dele Alli or Jack ­Grealish. But Southgate plans to speak to Maddison when the players meets up next week.
The England boss said: “It would be dangerous for me to go on a moral crusade. I’m not ­perfect and a lot of the players that we selected have had their ­moments, but it was not a good situation. So, that’s the ­challenge. You want to be high-performance, low-maintenance.

“I am prepared to work with players who are more difficult but you’re more likely to back those players if they’ve scored a winner for you and sweated blood for you, and that’s the bond you build.
“James probably didn’t realise what the consequences of going out might be, and he’s not been with an England team before. I’m sure he’s aware of that now.”
Southgate recalled fit-again Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and John Stones but showed his ruthless streak by overlooking Alli who has started Tottenham ’s last five games and axing Michael Keane after his drop in form. And much-vaunted ­Grealish must wait for his chance.
