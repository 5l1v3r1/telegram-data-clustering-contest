【兆元風電商機3】選前60天行情啟動　14檔風電股搶賺波段
07 Nov 2019, 22:05 by 鄧麗萍, 董孟航
距離大選倒數2個多月，具政策利多的風電股可望在選前有表現機會。不過專家提醒，最好檢視各業者的風電業績貢獻度和實質獲利，避開漲多個股、趁拉回再低接。
「距離選舉剩下60、70天，各大政黨都會針對能源政策積極發表政見，而風電的發展會比太陽能來得快。」第一金投顧董事長陳奕光認為，大選倒數計時，在政策利多題材帶動下，供應風機零件的公司可望有不錯的表現，包括世紀鋼、上緯、永冠等。
「永冠去年虧2.5元，今年第2季轉虧為盈，第3季也持續賺錢，預計明年EPS（每股純益）有機會達到3.4元。」陳奕光解釋，就算永冠過去幾年都賠錢，但隨著整個風電產業加速發展，仍具有翻身機會。
有「產業隊長」稱號的台股達人張捷表示，目前台灣風電產業供應鏈以上游製造業為主，產值以零組件為最大宗，「以製造塔架與水下基礎的世紀鋼、葉片樹脂的上緯投控、承攬陸上變電工程的台汽電等，貢獻產值最高。」他表示，離岸風電產業箭在弦上，趨勢確立，由於有預期獲利，股價不寂寞。
以潤泰材為例，近期拿下「離岸風電基座水下灌漿材」認證，成為亞洲唯一離岸風電砂漿廠，同時晉升全球前三大寶座，即使還未接到訂單，但市場看好之下，潤泰材股價已從9月下旬的25元漲至46元。
同樣搭上風電題材飆漲的世紀鋼，陳奕光分析：「它去年賺0.17元，估計今年賺0.51元，明年則估2.58元。只是股價去年因離岸風電遴選及開標而大漲，已差不多反映今年至明年風電獲利結構的改變。」
整體而言，過去1年風電股曾有兩波大漲行情，首先是去年4月離岸風電遴選，其次是8月下旬與廠商簽約之時，例如世紀鋼去年就暴漲約7倍，不過專家認為，目前資金行情延燒，加上選前政策利多，買風電股仍有獲利機會。

[Zhaoyuan Wind Power Business Opportunity 3] 60 days before the start of the market, 14 wind power stocks to earn the band

More than two months after the election, the wind power stocks with favorable policies are expected to have performance opportunities before the election. However, experts reminded that it is best to review the contribution of wind power performance and substantial profits of various industries, avoiding the rise of multiple stocks, and pulling back and then lowering.
""There are 60 or 70 days left until the election. All major political parties will actively express political views on energy policy, and the development of wind power will be faster than solar energy."" Chen Yinguang, chairman of the first gold investment, believes that the countdown to the election is in the theme of policy Driven by the company, the supply of fan parts is expected to have good performance, including Century Steel, Shangwei, Yongguan and so on.
""Yongguan lost 2.5 yuan last year, turned profitable in the second quarter of this year, and continued to make money in the third quarter. It is expected that EPS (per share of net profit) will have a chance to reach 3.4 yuan next year."" Chen Shuguang explained that even if Yongguan lost money in the past few years. However, with the accelerated development of the entire wind power industry, there is still a chance to turn over.
Zhang Jie, a Taiwanese company leader with the title of ""Industry Captain"", said that the current wind power industry supply chain in Taiwan is dominated by upstream manufacturing, and the output value is the largest component. ""To make towers and underwater foundations of Century Steel and Blade Resin Taiwan's gasoline power generation, which is controlled by Shangwei and contracted on land substation, contributed the highest output value."" He said that the offshore wind power industry is on the line and the trend is established. The stock price is not lonely because of the expected profit.
Taking Runtai as an example, it recently won the certification of “offshore wind power base underwater grouting material”, becoming the only offshore wind power mortar factory in Asia, and promoted to the world's top three thrones, even if it has not received orders, but the market is optimistic. Underneath, Runtai's share price has risen from 25 yuan in late September to 46 yuan.
Similarly, Century Steel, which has risen on the subject of wind power, said: ""It earned 0.17 yuan last year. It is estimated that it will earn 0.51 yuan this year and 2.58 yuan next year. It is only the stock price that rose last year due to the selection and opening of offshore wind power. The wind power profit structure has changed from this year to next year.""
Overall, there have been two surges in wind power stocks in the past year. First, offshore wind power selection in April last year, followed by contracting with manufacturers in late August. For example, Century Steel surged about 7 times last year, but experts It is believed that the current fund market is prolonged, and the pre-election policy is more favorable. There are still profit opportunities for buying wind power stocks.
