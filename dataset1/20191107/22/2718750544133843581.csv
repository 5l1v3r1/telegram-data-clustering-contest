Zoe Saldana and Reese Witherspoon are combining forces to bring you a best-selling story of love, loss, and love. The two women will produce an adaptation of Tembi Locke’s memoir From Scratch, which was released earlier this year and was the May 2019 pick for Reese’s Hello Sunshine book club. Saldana will star in the Netflix miniseries, which will adapted by Locke herself along with her sister, Attica, who will also serve as showrunner. The story, based on Tembi’s life, follows a women who finds love while studying abroad in Italy, and plans for happily ever after with him back home in the States. When he dies tragically from an illness, however, she has to make her way in life and raise her daughter while coping with the loss. Sounds like a classic Reese Witherspoon production.
