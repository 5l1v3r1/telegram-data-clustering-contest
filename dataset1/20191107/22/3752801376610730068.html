      <h1>Water supply to Hammanskraal restored as Temba purification plant is fixed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:07:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>The water supply has been restored to Hammanskraal, City of Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has announced.</p>
      <p>This after the suburb was without water following a temporary shutdown of the Temba water treatment plant by the City's utility services department last week.</p>
      <p>The shutdown was as a result of raw water quality from the Leeukraal Dam, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/water-tankers-continue-to-supply-hammanskraal-residents-20191028">News24 previously reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The Temba purification plant's operations were affected by a lightning strike at the Rooiwal waste water treatment plant which had an impact on the water supply. </p>
      <p>"The City will resume the process of withdrawing 66 water tankers that were delivered to Hammanskraal. This was done as an emergency measure because of insufficient water," Mokgalapa said.</p>
      <p>One of the most affected sites has been Jubilee Hospital which ended up having to put measures in place - in the form of changes to operations - to deal with its water crisis, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/update-emergency-measures-put-in-place-at-jubilee-hospital-to-deal-with-water-crisis-20191107">News24 reported on Wednesday</a>. </p>
      <p>Health MEC Bandile Masuku visited the hospital on Wednesday afternoon to assess the impact of the water crisis on the hospital. </p>
      <p>Residents have been urged to be patient as the reservoirs are still filling up. The process may delay the levels of water running from taps. </p>
      <p>The City has apologised for the inconvenience caused to residents. </p>
