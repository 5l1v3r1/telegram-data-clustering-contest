CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department is preparing to roll out the second tranche of aid to compensate farmers for losses due to the U.S.-China trade war, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Thursday.
“We’ll be getting it ready hopefully by the end of this month or early December,” Perdue said in a call with reporters.
The payments are part of a $16 billion aid package announced in May to be paid in three separate tranches.
