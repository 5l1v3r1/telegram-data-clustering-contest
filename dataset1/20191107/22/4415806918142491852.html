      <p>Essex Police said a series of files had been brought before an identification commission with the assistance of Vietnamese police.</p>
      <p>Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray has now formally identified all of the victims and their families have been notified.</p>
      <p>Mrs Beasley Murray said: “May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims’ families.”</p>
      <p>All of the deceased were Vietnamese nationals, a spokesman for Essex Police said.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith, who is leading the investigation, said: “This is an important step in the investigation and enables us to work with our Vietnamese police colleagues to support the families of those victims.</p>
      <p>“It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.</p>
      <p>“Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.”</p>
      <p>Vietnam sent a delegation of officials to the UK earlier this week to assist with the investigation.</p>
