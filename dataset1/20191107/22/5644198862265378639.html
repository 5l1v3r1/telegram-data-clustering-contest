      <p>MANAMA: A US-led naval coalition officially launched operations in Bahrain on Thursday (Nov 7) to protect shipping in the troubled waters of the Gulf, after a string of attacks that Washington and its allies blamed on Iran.</p>
      <p>The coalition, aimed at warding off the perceived threat to the world's oil supply, has been in the making since June.</p>

      <p>Iran, which has denied any responsibility for the mystery attacks, has put forward its own proposals for boosting Gulf security that pointedly exclude outside powers.</p>
      <p>Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, joined the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) in August. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed suit in September.</p>
      <p>Australia and Britain are the main Western countries to have agreed to send warships to escort Gulf shipping. The newest member, Albania, joined on Friday.</p>
      <p>Vessels will be escorted through the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic chokepoint at the head of the Gulf and the main artery for the transport of Middle East oil.</p>
      <p>Vice Admiral Jim Malloy, commander of US Naval Forces in the Middle East, said Operation Sentinel is a defensive measure aimed at protecting Gulf waters.</p>
      <p>"While Sentinel's operational design is threat-based, it does not threaten," he said during a ceremony at the IMSC's command centre.</p>
      <p>"We employ capable warships on patrol, but there is no offensive line of effort in this construct, other than a commitment to defend each other if attacked.</p>
      <p>"Our commitment to the region isn't short-lived, it is enduring, and we will operate as part of Sentinel for as long as it's needed - as long as the threat looms."</p>
      <p>Most European governments have declined to participate in the naval coalition, fearful of undermining their efforts to save a landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, which was badly weakened by Washington's withdrawal last year.</p>
      <p>Animosity between Tehran and Washington has soared since President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned the deal and reimposed crippling US sanctions.</p>
      <p>On May 12, the UAE said four commercial oil tankers - two Saudi, one Emirati and one Norwegian - had been targeted by "acts of sabotage" in waters off its coast.</p>
      <p>Washington and Riyadh blamed Tehran, which denied involvement.</p>
      <p>A month later, the Kokuka Courageous was hit and around the same time another tanker in the area, the Norwegian-owned Front Altair, was damaged by three explosions, according to the Norwegian Maritime Authority.</p>
      <p>They were transiting through the Strait of Hormuz towards the Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p>Then on Sep 4, drone strikes targeted two key Saudi oil facilities onshore, causing catastrophic damage and temporarily knocking out half of the kingdom's oil production.</p>
      <p>The attacks were claimed by Yemen's Huthi rebels who are battling a Saudi-led coalition, but Washington and Riyadh blamed Iran, saying the strikes were carried out with advanced missiles and drones.</p>
