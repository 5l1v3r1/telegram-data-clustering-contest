So with Disney+ set to launch inthe US, Canada, and Netherlands next week, then Australia and New Zealand a week later on 19th, lots of people have been eagerly awaiting when the streaming service would be available in the UK. Now we have an answer, and you are really not going to like it.



Fuck you Disney. Especially if content really is going to vary that much, because the least you could do is let us watch what you can offer right away and not wait an extra four and a half months.
The piracy folks are going to have a field day with The Mandalorian, and it could even give Game of Thrones a run for its money.
