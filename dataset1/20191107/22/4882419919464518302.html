      <p>FC Barcelona continue to comb the market for the best young players. Since the arrival of Patrick Kluivert as director of youth football, as well as a number of other changes in the scouting department, one of the players to catch the eye is Karim Adeyemi.</p>
      <p>According to Transfermarkt, the Spanish champions have already made an offer of 15 million euros for the Red Bull Salzburg forward.</p>
      <p>At 17, Adeyemi is currently playing for Salzburg's feeder club FC Liefering and is tipped to be one of the forwards to watch in the coming years. Barça have followed him for a while and all the reports on him are very positive.</p>
      <p>Transfermarkt say that Barça's first offer to the Austrian club would not be of interest to Salzburg, who don't want to lose one of their biggest talents on the cheap.</p>
      <p>Barcelona will continue to follow him with the idea of placing him in the B team, although they will face competition from a number of Premier League clubs.</p>
