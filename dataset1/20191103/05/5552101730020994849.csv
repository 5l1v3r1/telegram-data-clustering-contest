【全文】未拿官方補助　莫斯科音樂週的營運智慧
03 Nov 2019, 05:15 by 祁玲, 李鍾泉, 陳廷豐, 林雅菁
資源有限下，如何經營一個showcase音樂節？莫斯科音樂週創辦人史蒂潘卡薩彥（Stepan Kazaryan）的心法是：做出與眾不同的特色及明確的市場定位。
莫斯科音樂週以發掘新人為宗旨，邀請的表演團體9成是俄羅斯樂團，以前衛、古怪的非主流樂風為主，協助他們站上國際舞台。即使缺乏官方補助，這個僅舉辦5年的活動已闖出名號，成為當地規模最大的showcase音樂節。



史蒂潘原本任職公關公司，喜歡音樂的他，閒暇時間會承辦演唱會活動。2008年的金融海嘯害他失業，一時之間找不到適合的工作，遂把資遣費拿來當做承辦演唱會的基金，如此做了一段時間。
他回憶說：「我一度萌生退意，但父親和友人都鼓勵我繼續走這行。久而久之，承辦演唱會已從玩票性質變成正職。」他後來在一間俱樂部擔任節目總監，俱樂部停止營業後，他乾脆開一家演唱會公司Connected Agency，並於五年前創辦莫斯科音樂週（Moscow Music Week，簡稱MMW）。

創辦靈感來自史蒂潘七年前、去愛沙尼亞參加塔林音樂週（Tallinn Music Week）的經驗。他看到很多音樂人集結在一起，有showcase演出和論壇，心想俄羅斯也應該要有這樣的活動，便開始尋覓合夥人，同時申請官方補助，沒想到兩者都比想像中來得困難。厭倦等待的他於是放手一搏，獨自籌辦MMW。
史蒂潘不諱言，全世界showcase音樂節多如過江之鯽，內容大同小異。為了做出區隔，他邀請的表演團體九成是俄羅斯樂團，「這點已經與眾不同。」他也排除主流音樂，鎖定古怪、前衛的各類型非主流音樂，漸漸做出成績。
他說：「 檢視去年應邀採訪的國際媒體相關報導，他們的正面評價簡直像業配文，連我都很驚訝。但我沒付廣告費，也沒有把他們關在籠子裡、直到寫出好評才放人。」

MMW每年於8月底、9月初登場，為期4天，平均參與人數為4500至5000人。今年表演團體約150組，有16個表演場地。
除了以俄羅斯演出者為主，另一個特色是把樂團的展演活動依類型區分，就算觀眾對表演者不熟悉，也可以從感興趣的類型挑選想看的節目。
史蒂潘解釋：「我們的showcase依據音樂類型來區分，讓想接觸新人、卻對樂團陌生的觀眾更容易選擇，其他音樂節似乎沒這麼做過，還有人反映這是很棒的點子。」如今，有些音樂節也開始為showcase分類，他很高興MMW率先示範。

他大學念的是政治，因熱愛音樂才入行，不過興趣變成工作後，壓力不小，如今雖然仍愛聽音樂，但已無法從看演唱會得到樂趣。尤其MMW成立以來，官方從未給予補助。每年營運經費有八成五至九成來自門票收入，其餘靠廠商贊助，至今有兩年賺錢、兩年虧錢。

音樂活動具有教育意義和功能，有利於提升城市形象、振興觀光，可惜政府官員沒有意識到這一點。

史蒂潘不願透露MMW所需的實際金額，「我只能說真的很少，與其他showcase音樂節比起來是小巫見大巫。」他說就算公開數字，也沒有人會相信他竟能用這麼少的錢辦活動，甚至還邀請外國人士前往。

他坦言：「缺乏政府補助，對於經營MMW來說很大的挑戰。官方不一定要給錢，提供免費租借場地或其他資源也可以。這樣的音樂活動具有教育意義和功能，有利於提升城市形象、振興觀光，可惜政府官員還沒有意識到這一點，但我相信總有一天會有所改變。」

除了沒有官方補助，礙於政策規定，MMW也不能申請註冊活動名稱，導致即使有人冒名舉辦類似的音樂活動，史蒂潘也無法提出告訴。因為俄羅斯政府禁止人民以地理或區域名稱當做註冊商標，理由是地理名稱的使用權屬於每一個人，不能把「莫斯科」這幾個字變成私人所有。

樂團只需表演2首歌，產業相關人士如音樂節策展人，就能判定有無潛力，不需要讓他們唱很久。

雖然不透露預算數字，史蒂潘樂於分享有限預算下、經營showcase音樂節的心法。他表示，首先要掌握預算來源和金額，例如從政府補助、贊助和門票收入各可以拿到多少錢。再依據這個金額分配給節目製作、團隊、受邀參加者和樂團等各項支出。 扣除上述費用，若還有餘額，他會優先邀請國外媒體，最後才邀請俄羅斯各地的記者。

史蒂潘強調，了解自己的市場定位、並據此邀請媒體或專業的參訪對象很重要。他每年都會調整專業人士和記者的比例，例如2017年他邀請的對象以東歐專業人士居多，去年則增加了記者的比例，其中多半來自英國和德國。
近2、3年在MMW演出的樂團，有些已應邀至歐洲巡演，逐步在海外打響知名度，呼應MMW把俄羅斯新人推上國際舞台的創立宗旨，這都歸功於史蒂潘。但他謙稱：「不是我的功勞，是他們很聰明，也勇於嘗試接受其他showcase音樂節的邀請，在眾人面前展現實力。」

史蒂潘已走訪亞洲多次，據他觀察，很多音樂節主辦單位不了解一件事，那就是某個樂團只需表演兩首歌，產業相關人士如音樂節策展人，就可以判定是否喜歡、有無潛力，不需要讓他們演出一小時。因為時間有限，他就算再喜歡、還是得離開，去看其他人表演。
未來，他希望造訪更多亞洲音樂市場，尤其是韓國。史蒂潘說：「在當地看到很多有趣的團，當然也有很多差的。但我看過非常有趣的，也深受啟發。很想去韓國研究當地流行音樂現況。」

[Full Text] No official subsidy. Operational wisdom of Moscow Music Week
03 Nov 2019, 05:15 by Yan Ling, Li Zhongquan, Chen Tingfeng, Lin Yajing
How to run a showcase music festival with limited resources? Stepan Kazaryan, founder of Moscow Music Week, has a distinctive approach to making distinctive features and clear market positioning.
For the purpose of discovering new people, the Moscow Music Week invited 90% of the performing groups to be Russian orchestras, with avant-garde and quirky non-mainstream styles to help them stand on the international stage. Even with the lack of official subsidies, this five-year event has been named as the largest showcase music festival in the region.



Stefan originally worked as a public relations company. He likes music and will host concert events in his free time. The financial tsunami in 2008 killed him, and he could not find a suitable job at one time. He used the severance payment as a fund to host the concert.
He recalled: ""I once retired, but my father and friends encouraged me to continue this trip. Over time, the concert has changed from playing the ticket to becoming a full-time job."" He later served as a program director in a club and the club closed. After that, he simply opened a concert company, Connected Agency, and founded Moscow Music Week (MMW) five years ago.

The inspiration was inspired by Steven's seven years ago to travel to Estonia to participate in Tallinn Music Week. He saw a lot of musicians gathered together, showcase shows and forums, and thought that Russia should also have such activities, they began to look for partners, and applied for official subsidies, I did not expect both to be more difficult than imagined. Tired of waiting for him, he let go and set up MMW alone.
Stepan does not say that the world's showcase music festival is like a river, and the content is similar. In order to make a distinction, the 90% of the performing groups he invited were Russian orchestras. ""This is already different."" He also excluded mainstream music, locked in odd and avant-garde types of non-mainstream music, and gradually made achievements.
He said: ""Inspecting the international media reports that were interviewed last year, their positive comments are like industry essays, even I am very surprised. But I did not pay the advertising fees, and did not keep them in the cage until they wrote praise. Only release people.""

MMW debuts at the end of August and early September for a period of four days with an average of 4,500 to 5,000 participants. This year's performance group has about 150 groups and has 16 performance venues.
In addition to Russian performers, another feature is to distinguish the orchestra's performances by type. Even if the audience is not familiar with the performers, they can choose the programs they want to watch from the types of interest.
Stepan explained: ""Our showcases are distinguished by the type of music, making it easier for viewers who want to reach new people but are unfamiliar to the orchestra. Other music festivals don't seem to have done this. Others say this is a great idea."" Nowadays, some music festivals are beginning to be classified as showcases, and he is very happy that MMW is the first to demonstrate.

He studied politics at university, and he loved music because he was interested in music. However, after the interest became work, the pressure was not small. Although he still loves to listen to music, he can no longer enjoy watching concerts. Especially since the establishment of MMW, the official has never given a subsidy. Eighty-five to ninety percent of the annual operating expenses come from ticket sales, and the rest are sponsored by manufacturers. So far, two years have made money and two years have lost money.

Musical activities have educational significance and functions, which are conducive to enhancing the image of the city and revitalizing tourism. Unfortunately, government officials are not aware of this.

Stefan didn't want to reveal the actual amount of money needed for MMW. ""I can only say that it's really rare. Compared with other showcase music festivals, it's a shame."" He said that even if there are public figures, no one will believe that he can With so little money to do activities, and even invite foreigners to travel.

He said frankly: ""The lack of government subsidies is a big challenge for operating MMW. Officials don't have to give money, and they can provide free rental space or other resources. Such music activities have educational significance and functions, which are conducive to enhancing the image of the city. It is a pity that the government officials have not realized this, but I believe that there will be some changes in the day.""

In addition to the absence of official subsidies, MMW was not able to apply for the name of the registration activity due to policy regulations, which made it impossible for Steven to tell even if someone impersonated a similar music event. Because the Russian government prohibits people from using geographical or regional names as registered trademarks on the grounds that the right to use geographical names belongs to everyone, the words ""Moscow"" cannot be turned into private ownership.

The orchestra only needs to perform 2 songs, and industry stakeholders such as music festival curators can determine whether there is potential or not, and they don't need to sing for a long time.

Although not revealing the budget figures, Stephan is happy to share the mindset of the showcase music festival under a limited budget. He said that the first thing to do is to know the source and amount of the budget, such as how much money can be obtained from government subsidies, sponsorships and ticket sales. Based on this amount, it is allocated to the production of the program, the team, the invited participants and the orchestra. After deducting the above fees, if there is a balance, he will give priority to foreign media, and finally invite journalists from all over Russia.

Stepan emphasized that it is important to understand your market position and to invite media or professional visitors. He adjusts the proportion of professionals and journalists every year. For example, in 2017 he invited the majority of professionals in Eastern Europe, and last year increased the proportion of journalists, most of them from the UK and Germany.
Some orchestras performing at MMW in the past 2 or 3 years have been invited to tour Europe and gradually become famous overseas, echoing MMW's founding purpose of bringing Russian newcomers to the international stage, thanks to Steven. But he humbly said: ""It's not my credit. They are smart and have the courage to try to accept invitations from other showcase music festivals to show their strength in front of everyone.""

Stefan has visited Asia many times. According to him, many music festival organizers don’t understand one thing. That is, an orchestra only needs to perform two songs. Industry stakeholders, such as music festival curators, can judge whether Like, have no potential, don't need to let them perform for an hour. Because of the limited time, even if he likes it again, he still has to leave to see other people perform.
In the future, he hopes to visit more Asian music markets, especially South Korea. Stepan said: ""There are a lot of interesting groups in the area, and of course there are a lot of bad ones. But I have seen it very interesting and inspired. I really want to go to Korea to study the current situation of local pop music.""
