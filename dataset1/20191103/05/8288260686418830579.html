      <p>If you are looking for a really <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/new-independent-italian-restaurant-been-13483294">authentic Italian pasta experience, </a>then look no further.</p>
      <p>Laghi's serves up a carbonara pasta like no other!</p>
      <p>The restaurant owned by Luca Laghi, prides itself on serving the most authentic carbonara you will find in Brum. This is Roman style carbonara made with rigatoni pasta, eggs, pecorino cheese,  Guanciale (cured pig cheek) and peppercorn.</p>

      <p>Or how about black ravioli stuffed with carb and mascarpone, smoked provola fondue with homemade onion jam?</p>
      <p>On our visit we loved their linguine with monkfish - beautifully cooked al dente pasta with a classic fresh tomato and basil sauce.</p>
      <p>The pasta here is all hand made on site by chefs including Luca's mum.  Bellissimo.</p>

      <p>Award-winning Fumo cocktail bar and restaurant specialises in 'ciccheti' (Venetian-style tapas). Among our ciccheti favourites is their incredible gnocchi gorgonzola in a baked parmesan basket. So good, you may want to order two plates - they are tapas style portions after all.</p>
      <p>Other pasta small plates include lasagne al forno -  layers of pasta with slow cooked beef ragu, ravioli lobster with lobster bisque and prawns, and spinach and ricotta ravioli - with pachino tomatoes. </p>
      <p>This is the place for a pasta party - or any kind of party.</p>

      <p>Wild Mushroom Tagliatelle -  Eyrngii &amp; enoki mushrooms, torrontés white wine cream, tarragon and raw yolk is worth a visit just for this alone!</p>

      <p>And the  swanky surroundings make this a sensational dining experience - whatever you order.
