馬利軍事基地遇襲54死，剛換新領袖的「伊斯蘭國」坦承犯案
03 Nov 2019, 05:12 by Lo


我們想讓你知道的是馬利從9月下旬開始遭受數次大小襲擊，凸顯當地武裝份子日益茁壯、影響範圍越來越大。當地的武裝團體與蓋達組織、伊斯蘭國等有所聯繫，並做為這些恐怖組織在馬利的據點，影響範圍還包括鄰近的尼日與布吉納法索。



（中央社）馬利（Mali）東北部一個軍方前哨基地1日遇襲，造成至少53名官兵、1名平民喪生，激進組織伊斯蘭國（IS）旗下阿瑪克通訊社（Amaq）2日報導稱，伊斯蘭國犯下這起攻擊案，但未交代犯案證據。
馬利政府表示，馬利東北部一個軍方前哨基地遇襲，造成53名官兵和1名平民喪命。這是西非國家馬利軍方近期遭逢的最致命攻擊之一。
《衛報》報導，馬利從9月下旬開始遭受數次大小襲擊，凸顯當地武裝份子日益茁壯、影響範圍越來越大。當地的武裝團體與蓋達組織、伊斯蘭國等有所聯繫，並做為這些恐怖組織在馬利的據點，影響範圍還包括鄰近的尼日與布吉納法索。9月30日，馬利中部兩個軍事基地被襲擊，造成38名馬利士兵被殺。儘管法國軍隊和其他國際部隊也駐紮在馬利，但這些遭襲擊的軍事基地已脫離政府控制。
10月份，在馬利靠近布吉納法索的金礦場，也遭遇武裝攻擊，造成約20人死亡。
《CNN》報導，包括蓋達組織在內的恐怖組織，之所以會在西非布局，是因當地有許多分離主義的武裝團體，從2012年開始日漸嚴重，因為當地政府軍或是外國援助的部隊，始終無法有效掌握西非國家的某些內陸區域。歐盟在一份聲明中表示：「歐盟支持馬利政府與人民，對抗這種嚴重的暴力行為。並會繼續參與馬利的維安行動，使該國在所有領土上重新建立國家權威，以確保其發展和公民的繁榮。」
馬利遭攻擊54死，挑戰法國及非洲反恐承諾
《中央社》報導，近期幾起攻擊案對中西非國家反恐武力及法國來說，都是一種羞辱。法新社報導，這是近期伊斯蘭武裝暴力針對馬利軍方發起的最嚴重攻擊之一。
馬利通訊部長桑加雷（Yaya Sangare）在推特發文表示，另有一名平民在接近馬利與尼日邊境的梅納卡（Menaka）地區因代利曼（Indelimane）前哨基地被殺。
除了說明最新死亡人數，他還說：「情況已在控制之中，搜索及辨識死者的程序持續進行。」桑加雷表示，有10名倖存者在前哨基地被發現，前哨基地受損相當嚴重。此外沒有更多關於這起攻擊案的細節。
馬利政府先前譴責這起「恐怖攻擊」，指這起事件造成許多傷亡，但未提到精確數據。政府聲明還表示，已派增援去保護這片區域及追捕發起攻擊的人。尚未有任何組織承認犯下這起攻擊案。
一個月前，在靠近馬利與布吉納法索邊境處，發生兩起聖戰士攻擊案，造成40名軍人死亡，但幾個消息人士提到死亡人數被淡化。
伊斯蘭極端分子勢力從馬利北部的不毛之地延伸到中部，中部地區混居不同種族，是個不太穩定的地區，馬利軍方面對他們的造反陷入苦戰。
近期攻擊案對G5沙赫爾國家組織（G5 Sahel）和法國來說是一種羞辱，G5 Sahel這個大肆宣傳的組織由馬利、查德、布吉納法索、茅利塔尼亞及尼日等5國聯合組成，有5000人的反恐武力；法國則是承諾支援這個脆弱的區域。
前領袖剛死就有行動，伊斯蘭國的新領導是誰？
《中央社》報導，伊斯蘭國10月31日證實，首腦巴格達迪（Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi）在美軍於敘利亞西北部的突襲中喪命，除了誓言對美國進行報復，也公布新的領導人。美國總統川普（Donald Trump）10月27日宣布，巴格達迪在美軍特種部隊追緝下走投無路，最終引爆炸彈身亡。
伊斯蘭國以錄音形式在網路上公布巴格達迪的死訊，並宣布已指定哈希米（Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi）為繼任者。
英國斯旺西大學（Swansea University）伊斯蘭國專家塔米米（Aymenn al-Tamimi）表示，外界沒聽過這號人物，但他可能是名為阿布達拉（Hajj Abdullah）的伊斯蘭國要角。美國國務院曾點名哈希米是巴格達迪的接班人。
塔米米說：「我認為他們意圖傳達這項訊息：『不要只因為你們殺了巴格達迪，以及這名官方發言人，就認為能摧毀這項計畫。』」
川普：美國知道IS新頭目是誰
《中央社》報導，美國總統川普1日表示，美國知道伊斯蘭國（IS）新領導人是誰。國務院反恐協調官賽爾斯（Nathan Sales）誓言，將繼續對這些極端分子施壓，「絕不寬貸」。
賽爾斯在記者詢問下並未透露哈希米的詳細資料，只表示，美國正在「調查伊斯蘭國新領導人、他原本扮演的角色以及他出身的組織」。
賽爾斯說：「我們將動用一切國力工具，來繼續對伊斯蘭國施加反恐壓力，絕不寬貸。」、「我們將瓦解伊斯蘭國，無論其領導幹部是誰。」

The Marley military base was attacked 54 dead, and the ""Islamic State"" who just replaced the new leader confessed to committing crimes.
03 Nov 2019, 05:12 by Lo


What we want you to know is that Marley has suffered several attacks from the end of September, highlighting the growing strength of the local armed forces and the growing scope of influence. Local armed groups have contact with al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, etc., and as a stronghold of these terrorist organizations in Mali, the scope of influence also includes neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.



(Central News Agency) A military outpost in northeastern Mali was attacked on the 1st, killing at least 53 officers and soldiers and a civilian. The militant organization of the Islamic State (IS) Amac News Agency (Amaq) reported on the 2nd. The Islamic State committed the attack but did not submit evidence of the crime.
The government of Mali said that a military outpost in northeastern Mali was attacked, killing 53 officers and soldiers and one civilian. This is one of the most deadly attacks on the West African military’s recent military encounter.
The Guardian reported that Marley has suffered several large-scale attacks since late September, highlighting the growing strength of the local armed forces and the growing scope of influence. Local armed groups have contact with al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, etc., and as a stronghold of these terrorist organizations in Mali, the scope of influence also includes neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso. On September 30, two military bases in central Mali were attacked, killing 38 Marley soldiers. Although the French army and other international forces are also stationed in Marley, these attacked military bases have been out of government control.
In October, an armed attack was carried out in Marley’s gold mine near Burkina Faso, killing about 20 people.
CNN reported that terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, will be deployed in West Africa because there are many separatist armed groups in the region, which have become increasingly serious since 2012 because of local government forces or foreign aid troops. It is not always possible to effectively grasp certain inland areas of West African countries. The EU said in a statement: ""The EU supports the Mali government and the people to fight this serious violence. It will continue to participate in the peacekeeping operations in Mali, so that the country can re-establish national authority in all territories to ensure Its development and the prosperity of its citizens.""
Marley was attacked 54 dead, challenging France and Africa's anti-terrorism commitment
The Central News Agency reported that several recent attacks have been a humiliating act against the anti-terrorist force of the West and Central African countries and France. Agence France-Presse reported that this is one of the most serious attacks launched by the Islamic armed violence against the Mali military.
Marley Communications Minister Yaya Sangare said in a tweet that another civilian was killed at the Indelimane outpost near the Menaka area on the border with Mali and Niger.
In addition to explaining the latest death toll, he added: ""The situation is under control, and the process of searching for and identifying the deceased continues."" Sangare said that 10 survivors were found in the outpost and the outpost was seriously damaged. . There is no more details about this attack.
The Marley government previously condemned the ""terrorist attack"", saying that the incident caused many casualties, but did not mention accurate data. The government statement also stated that reinforcements have been sent to protect the area and to hunt down the attackers. No organization has yet admitted to committing this attack.
A month ago, two holy warriors attacked the border between Marley and Burkina Faso, killing 40 soldiers, but several sources mentioned that the death toll was diluted.
The Islamic extremist forces extended from the barren land in the north of Mali to the central part. The central region was mixed with different races and was a less stable area. The Ma Lijun was struggling against their rebellion.
The recent attack is a humiliation for G5 Sahel and France, and G5 Sahel is a big propaganda organization by Marley, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. The five countries are united and there are 5,000 anti-terrorist forces; France is committed to supporting this fragile region.
The former leader has acted just after death. Who is the new leader of the Islamic State?
The Central News Agency reported that the Islamic State confirmed on October 31 that the head of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a raid by the US military in northwestern Syria. In addition to vows to retaliate against the United States, new leaders were also announced. US President Donald Trump announced on October 27 that Baghdadi had nowhere to go under the chasing of US special forces and eventually led to the bombing.
The Islamic State published the death of Baghdadi on the Internet in a recorded form and announced that it had designated Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi as its successor.
Aymenn al-Tamimi, an Islamic State expert at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, said that the outside world had not heard of this person, but he may be the head of the Islamic State called Hajj Abdullah. The US State Department once named Hashimi as the successor of Baghdadi.
Tamimi said: ""I think they intend to convey this message: ""Don't just because you killed Baghdadi and this official spokesperson, you think you can destroy this project.""
Trump: The United States knows who IS is the new leader.
""Central News Agency"" reported that US President Trump said on the 1st that the United States knows who the new leader of the Islamic State (IS) is. Nathan Sales, the State Department’s counter-terrorism coordinator, vowed to continue to pressure these extremists to “never lend a loan”.
Under the reporter's inquiry, Seles did not disclose the details of Hashemi. He only said that the United States is ""investigating the new leader of the Islamic State, his original role and the organization he was born in.""
Sayers said: ""We will use all national tools to continue to exert anti-terrorism pressure on the Islamic State and never lend money."" ""We will disintegrate the Islamic State, regardless of its leading cadres.""
Extended reading


""He is dead like a dog and a coward!"" Trump confirmed: The head of the Islamic State, Baghdadi, was killed by the US military.


Although Baghdadi is dead, the problem remains unresolved.


Trump screamed how the US military ""forced"" the IS leader, and experts worried that more holy soldiers would carry out ""retaliation attacks.""


Although the leader of the Islamic State died, Islamic radicalism still hangs over the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
