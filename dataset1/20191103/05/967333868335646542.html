        <b>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday she expects the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump to begin public hearings this month but insisted there’s no deadline to finish the investigation and close-doors meetings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pelosi spoke a day after the House voted to set up a formal process for public hearings in an investigation of the allegations that US President Donald Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine to open a politically motivated investigation in exchange for releasing military aid.</p>
      <p>“I would assume there would be public hearings in November,” Pelosi said in a roundtable with Bloomberg reporters and editors, adding that any case made to impeach the president “has to be ironclad.”</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t know what the timetable will be,” she said. “We have not made any decisions on if the president will be impeached.”</blockquote>
      <p>Trump, while leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Mississippi, told reporters, “You can’t impeach a president who did nothing wrong. You can’t impeach a president who has the greatest economy.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20191031/1077191544.html">Pelosi</a> also declared that Congress should pursue an impeachment inquiry regardless of its impact on financial markets. “The markets have their own strength and their resilience,” she said.</p>
      <p>On 24 September, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry over a whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump might have abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a 25 July phone call to investigate potential corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Trump released the transcript of the call and slammed the impeachment inquiry as a “hoax” and another political witch hunt aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
