Mario Maker Contest: Too Many Thwomps
03 Nov 2019, 05:05 by Zack Zwiezen



Thwomps are possibly my favourite enemy in the Mario universe. They look cool and seem tough, but the other thing I love is their name. Thowmps. It is just fun to say. Just fun enemy all around, so let’s make some levels featuring these great enemies.
Your Challenge This Week: Create levels featuring Thwomps!
Theme: Thwomps, Thwomp, Too Many Thwomps
Use any style you want and make the levels as long or short as you desire. The only important thing is to make sure you include some Thwomps. How many? I don’t know, but try to include more than one. You can never have too many Thwomps. (I was just informed that you can, in fact, have too many Thwomps. Sorry.)
Next week I’ll pick some of my favourite courses and a winner.
How To Submit A Level — Instructions1. Build a new course based on the challenge.2. Name the level and please add “Kotaku” AND / OR the theme this week into the name of the level. Once that’s done, upload it in Super Mario Maker 2 for the Nintendo Switch.3. Then post the course ID into the comments, along with the name of the level and any other info you want to include. PLEASE include the name of the course in the comments.
