      <h2>The mum was looking through her pictures taken at a Sutton Coldfield Cinema and noticed a man sitting behind them wearing goggles likes an old fashioned pilot</h2>

      <p>Is the face of a ghost haunting a Birmingham cinema?</p>
      <p>One mum certainly thinks so after capturing a shadowy figure photo-bombing a selfie.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old mother took her daughter and nephew to Empire Cinema, on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/row-erupts-outside-court-nabeel-17184199">Birmingham Road, Sutton Coldfield</a> , when she took the spooky image.</p>

      <p>It was not until days later that she noticed a mysterious figure sat behind them in the snap.</p>
      <p>The spooky soul seems to be wearing goggles and is looking down at the camera with his hands clasped before him.</p>
      <p>What is more intriguing is that there are no seats where the man is supposed to be sat - only a space for people to exit.</p>
      <p>The mum - who is also from Sutton Coldfield - said: “I knew it was strange. The corridor veers out and there are no further seats behind me.</p>
      <p>"There’s nowhere for someone to sit. I thought the person or whoever it is sitting there has got these old fashioned goggles on their head, like a pilot.</p>
      <p>“I would’ve noticed if someone was sitting there because it was just before the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/aldi-christmas-2019-advert-takes-17184409">film was going to start</a> and the cinema wasn’t packed out.</p>
      <p>"There were a series of selfies I took with me and the children and he suddenly appears in one of them.”</p>
      <p>The picture was taken in 2014 as the family watched a movie. Yet the image has played on the mum’s mind as time has gone on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “Over the years, I showed the photographs to friends and they thought it was strange, particularly with the goggles.</p>
      <p>“When <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/couple-aged-98-95-left-17183043">Birmingham Live</a> asked this week if anyone had seen had seen a ghost to get in touch, I thought I would send it in, so the readers could make their mind up.</p>
      <p>She added: “When I was a kid and growing up, I always used to go to the Odeon as it was known back then and there were stories that there was ghost or it was haunted.</p>
      <p>“I thought nothing of it.</p>
      <p>“Maybe the readers know what it is?”</p>
