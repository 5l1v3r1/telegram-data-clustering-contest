      <p>PARIS: Memphis Depay's last-gap goal earned a recovering Olympique Lyonnais a 3-2 victory at Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lyon twice came from behind, Depay and Moussa Dembele cancelling out Yaya Sanogo's goal and keeper Anthony Lopes's own goal, and Depay got the winning strike five minutes into extra time to lift them to eighth on 16 points from 12 games.</p>
