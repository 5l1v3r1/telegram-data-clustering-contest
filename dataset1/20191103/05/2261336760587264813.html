      <p>Madison Square Garden in New York City was home to a great night of fights. The card saw seven (T)KOs, zero submissions and five decisions, including one split-decision.</p>
      <p>The main event was as advertised, a fast-paced, brutal affair with Jorge Masvidal out-landing and out-classing Nate Diaz handily before the ringside physician stepped in after the third round, putting an end to the fight due to a massive cut over Diaz’s right eye. The fans in attendance were disappointed with the outcome and immediately began a chant of “Bullshit! Bullshit!” Masvidal used his mic time after being awarded the BMF belt to promise Diaz that they would run it back ASAP. Stockton’s favorite son readily agreed, so at the bare minimum, we get another fight between two, and that is the silver lining.</p>
      <p><b>Performances of the Night:</b> Corey Anderson, Kevin Lee</p>
      <p>Finishes were notched in the most exciting fashion by Lyman Good, Yairzinho Rozenstruik, Edmen Shahbazyan, Shane Burgos, Corey Anderson, Kevin Lee and Jorge Masvidal. Despite the bountiful array of stoppages, only Corey Anderson and Kevin Lee took home performance bonuses for their outstanding first-round knockouts of Johnny Walker and Gregor Gillespie.</p>
      <p><b>Fight of the Night:</b> Stephen Thompson vs. Vicente Luque</p>
      <p>We also got some terrific fights from Derrick Lewis, Stephen Thompson, Hakeem Dawodu, Darren Till and Katlyn Chookagian, but it was the Thompson-Luque fight that took home FOTN honors. Stephen Thompson handled Luque like the savvy veteran, turning in an exciting, dominant performance that left no doubt that he is still very much an elite-level talent.</p>

      <p><b>Attendance:</b> 20,143 - sellout</p>
