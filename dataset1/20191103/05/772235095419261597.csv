Lexus LC Convertible prototype visits Australia
But there's still no word on whether the production model will be added to the local range, and when it'll be here if that happens.

The Lexus LC Convertible prototype has touched down in Australia to be displayed at the 2019 Lexus Melbourne Cup.
Still wrapped in digital camouflage fresh from its world debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July this year, the body design looks almost identical to the concept revealed at the Detroit motor show earlier this year.
There are no blue Lexus badges to be seen, so it's not powered by the V6 hybrid system offered on the LC500h coupe. Instead, it features the same petrol V8 engine as the LC500 coupe. Take a look at the video above to hear it sing.
The interior is still a work in progress so we can't show you details, but a temporary leather cover currently protects the camel-coloured leather.
Whether the production model will have soft or hardtop still hasn't been announced, and was hard to ascertain in our recent spy photos.

“We’re really thrilled to have the LC Convertible prototype in Australia for the Lexus Melbourne Cup, where it has been air freighted here directly from Europe.
“I think the LC coupe has been a real design icon for us. It’s a huge brand builder and a real showcase of what our design team can do. This really is the next step for Lexus.”
See the LC convertible prototype on show at the Melbourne Cup Carnival from November 2 to 10.
