03 Nov 2019, 05:19 by 關鍵評論網 ASEAN：Indochina


我們想讓你知道的是湄公河下游流域第一座水力發電站沙耶武里大壩10月29日於寮國啟用，引發泰國黎府民眾抗議、擔憂將影響生計；印尼於10月28日無預警宣布，原訂明年1月1日生效的鎳礦出口禁令即日實施。

南洋誌東南亞週報第38期，為讀者挑選2019年10月26日至11月1日期間，有關寮國、泰國、印尼、越南、泰國、馬來西亞、新加坡等六則東協區域大事。
寮國&泰國｜湄公河沙耶武里大壩正式啟用，引發泰國民眾抗議
湄公河下游流域第一座水力發電站沙耶武里（Xayaburi）大壩10月29日於寮國啟用，引發泰國黎府（Loei）民眾抗議、擔憂將影響生計。沙耶武里大壩發電容量為1285千瓩，其中95%發電量預計將輸送至泰國，並將以每單位2泰銖（約為新台幣2.02元）的平均價格售出。
沙耶武里大壩自規劃起就曾引發用水和食物安全爭議，因為湄公河上游已有中國政府於中國境內所建造的11座水壩，引發將影響下游寮國、泰國、柬埔寨、及越南上百萬人民生計的擔憂。沙耶武里大壩是由泰國銀行和公司所資助和營建，耗資1350億泰銖（約為新台幣1364.1億元 ）、工期長達9年。
位於泰國依靠捕魚維生的Ban Namprai村，正經歷有史以來最為乾旱的一年。根據《路透社》報導，該村村民表示，通常雨季結束時湄公河至少有3米的河水高度，而村民將會於此時舉行龍舟比賽。然而，今年龍舟比賽卻因為水位過低而取消。當地漁民指出，在今年3月沙耶武里大壩甫試運轉時，他們亦觀察到無法純粹透過乾旱而解釋的河水流量不穩定現象。
負責開發沙耶武里大壩的泰國公司CK Power表示，湄公河水乾枯的原因在於今年雨季延遲抵達、以及上游中國所建造的水壩所導致。
寮國是東南亞唯一的內陸國，由於土地貧瘠，所以致力於成為「亞洲的電池」。寮國目前擁有44座營運中的水力發電廠，且尚有46座正在建設中。

印尼｜調查違規出口，鎳礦出口禁令無預警實施
鎳礦出口大國印尼於10月28日無預警宣布，原訂2020年1月1日生效的鎳礦出口禁令，在與業者達成協議後即刻開始實施。隔日印尼政府改口表示，停止出口乃為調查近期國內違反出口配額規定的情事，預計調查完畢後，1至2週內即恢復鎳礦出口。
印尼政府9月2日時即宣布2020年開始停止鎳金屬出口，比原訂2022年提早2年。能源及礦產資源部官員阿里約諾（Bambang Gatot Ariyono）表示，印尼每年需要8100萬噸的鎳礦，而國內鎳礦儲量有限，已探明的鎳礦僅剩6.98億公噸，只能再使用7至8年，為了加速國內冶煉工業的建立，且因鎳為鋰電池原料，期為發展電動車產業做好準備因而頒布禁令。政策一公布，倫敦金屬交易所（LME）的鎳礦金額創下近五年新高，來到每公噸1萬8850美元。
根據投資協調委員會主席巴赫利爾（Bahlil Lahadalia）在28日的聲明，禁令提早實施並非政府單方的決議，而是國內鎳礦產業協會與政府達成的協議，一致同意即刻停止鎳礦出口。而至29日時，礦業與海事協調部長潘賈譚（Luhut Pandjaitan）則指出，自九月宣布2020年停止出口政策後，國內鎳礦出口量大幅增加，恐有違規情事，因而下令暫時停止出口並讓肅貪委員會、關稅局等相關單位進行調查，一至二週後即會恢復正常出口，禁令維持至2020年生效。

越南｜河內捷運試通車，力拼年底正式營運
河內第一條捷運線「吉靈-河東線」自10月28日開始試車，將展開20天的測試階段，對全數13台列車進行測試，並由國營的河內捷運公司負責監工。
河內自2008年就已經開始規劃捷運建設，包含有9條路線，總長度為410公里，其中342公里是高架運行、68公里為地下化。第一條2A線，路線由吉靈坊（Cat Linh）到河東郡（Ha Đong）共13公里長、12個站，亦被稱為「吉靈-河東線」。
吉靈-河東線從2011年10月開始施工，原定2013年完成未果，規劃延至2017年第三季完工、2018年第一季正式營運。然而工期再度延宕，自2018年9月才進行首次試車，原本預計3至6個月後即能通車，又延遲一年餘。建設經費也從原定的3億7,700萬美金一路倍增到8億6800萬美金（約260億新台幣），其中6億7000萬美金資金來源為中國提供的貸款。
越南副總理鄭廷勇（Trinh Dinh Dung）於十月初向媒體表示，今年一定會讓河內捷運通車，並透露捷運工程已完成99%，僅差統包商中國中鐵六局集團與交通部進行捷運移交作業與提供安全認證文件，交通部長阮文世（Nguyen Van The）指出，預計可在30至45天內完成。然而捷運工程的顧問公司法商Apave-Certifier-Tricc則表示，整體安全評估應需費時6個月，恐怕未能如期於今年底營運。
本月傳出河內當局可能將吉靈-河東線延長至河內市西南方的春梅鎮（Xuan Mai），從14公里延長至34公里，其他線段也擬延長建設。而原定2017年營運的第二條捷運3號線/仁-河內線（Nhon-Hanoi），則預計延遲至2020年底才會通車，首批車廂將於明年7月交貨，工程費用仍維持在2014年規畫的13億美金。

泰國｜泰政府不顧美方反對，通過三種農藥禁令
泰國國家有害物質委員會（The National Committee on Hazardous Substances）10月22日通過對於三種農藥的禁令，包括巴拉刈（paraquat）及嘉磷塞（glyphosate）等兩種除草劑，以及陶斯松（chlorpyrifos）殺蟲劑，並將於12月1日生效。此三種農藥將被列為泰國第四類有害物質，往後三種農藥都不得於泰國製造、進出口、轉移或持有。
根據《路透社》報導，禁令本身並沒有延伸到農產品，但反對農藥禁令的農民團體指出，他們呼籲泰國也能夠禁止任何來自使用三種農藥國家的農作物進口，其中便包含美國。媒體於10月25日披露一封由美國農業部副部長麥金尼（Ted McKinney）致泰國總理帕拉育（Prayuth Chan-ocha）的信件，內文要求泰國能夠暫緩執行對於嘉磷塞除草劑的禁令。麥金尼指出，若禁令執行後，將會嚴重影響諸如美國黃豆和美國小麥等農業原物料的進口，因此呼籲泰國維持現行透過限制農藥殘留量的審查標準。此外，美方亦譴責泰國政府在沒有足夠科學證據支持的情況下便禁用嘉磷塞。
泰國衛生部長參威拉軍（Anutin Charnvirakul）於10月25日旋即回應，美國在意的只有貿易，而泰國政府關心的是泰國消費者的健康。他表示，「美國擔心未來無法賣出他們的產品，因而要求我們解除禁令。我們應該要對美方的動作低頭嗎？」他說，有害物質委員會的29位專家在達成禁令的共識之前，已經對於禁令的優缺點作出研究有段時間了。
泰國目前每年向美國進口約732億泰銖（約為新台幣739.41億元）的農產品，而嘉磷塞則是由美國農業生技巨頭孟山都（Monsanto）所發展出的農藥、並透過Roundup品牌進行銷售。

馬來西亞｜1MDB案關鍵人物劉特佐與美國司法部和解，同意放棄逾7億美元資產
美國司法部10月30日表示，已與馬來西亞一馬發展公司（1MDB） 弊案的關鍵人物劉特佐（Jho Low）達成和解，劉特佐同意放棄美國政府尋求扣押的逾7億美元資產，包括比佛利山的一間旅館以及一架私人飛機。
美國聯邦檢察官韓納（Nick Hanna）指出，劉特佐涉嫌用盜自一馬發展公司的大筆金錢，透過購買包括美國在內的多國昂貴資產來洗錢，「多虧這份和解協議，涉嫌這大宗計畫的核心人物之一，將無法動用數以億計的美元」。美國司法部刑事案件部門負責人本切科夫斯基（Brian Benczkowski）也指出，這份協議表明美國不會成為貪腐資金安全避風港的立場。該和解協議有待法院批准，一旦法院同意，將成為美國史上金額最大宗之民事充公協議。
大馬首相馬哈迪31日旋即表示，劉特佐非法購買的資產，是用大馬人民的錢買的，「我們可以證明這是馬來西亞的錢」，因此將向美國政府索要款項。劉特佐目前仍為美國通緝之逃犯，目前可能藏身於中國大陸或中東等國家。1MDB案於2015年曝光後引起廣大民怨，是造成納吉政府2018年大選慘敗的主要原因之一。

新加坡＆馬來西亞｜新航與馬航正式達成擴大共用班號合作協議
新加坡航空與馬來西亞航空10月30日宣布，雙邊已正式簽署擴大共用班號的合作協議，未來將增加共用班號服務航線，以及聯合營銷來促進新馬的觀光旅遊業。
新航與馬航今年6月27日簽署諒解備忘錄以來，雙邊即磋商加強兩家航空公司合作的正式協議內容，歷經4個多月的談判過程終於正式達成協議。該協議使新航與其子公司勝安航空（SikeAir），能與馬航經營飛往大馬16個機場的共用班號航線，例如關丹、瓜拉登嘉樓、浮羅交怡等地。此外，兩公司也將運用共用班號機制，加強經營飛往歐洲與南非等國際航線。
根據《聯合早報》社論指出，新航與馬航雖屬於不同的航空聯盟，但事實上1972年分家後，就以共用班號方式經營新加坡往返吉隆坡航線，成為兩家航空公司擴大合作的基礎。往訪兩國首都的航線是全球最繁忙的國際航線之一，每年超過3萬次航班與400萬人次搭乘，是兩國合作與開放天空的成果。如今共用班號合作範圍擴大，將可能帶動其他航線旅客數量的成長。
由於馬航自從1997亞洲金融風暴後長年虧損，加上2014年兩起空難使得大馬國籍航空經營陷入困境，近年不斷傳出政府將關閉或轉賣馬航的消息。大馬上週才剛宣布已鎖定四家可能投資的潛在公司，而目前正積極透過共用班號的機制與其他航空合作，希望能改善經營狀況，例如10月才剛宣布和英國航空達成共用班號協議，涵蓋飛往14個機場的航班。

[Southeast Asia Weekly] The Shuye Buri Dam in Laos is used to open the Yintai people's dissatisfaction | Indonesia has no warning to implement the nickel mine export ban in advance | Hanoi MRT is expected to be officially operated at the end of the year
03 Nov 2019, 05:19 by Key Commentary ASEAN: Indochina


We want you to know that the Shay Buri Dam, the first hydroelectric power station in the lower reaches of the Mekong River, was opened in Shu State on October 29, triggering protests from residents in Loei, Thailand, and concerns will affect livelihoods; Indonesia has no warning on October 28 It was announced that the ban on nickel ore export, which was originally scheduled to come into effect on January 1 next year, will be implemented on the same day.

Laos & Thailand | Mekong River Shay Buri Dam officially opened, triggering protests from Thai people
The Xayaburi dam, the first hydroelectric power station in the lower reaches of the Mekong River, was opened in the country on October 29, triggering protests and concerns from Loei in Thailand that will affect livelihoods. The Shay Buri Dam has a capacity of 1,285 thousand kilowatts, 95% of which is expected to be delivered to Thailand and will be sold at an average price of 2 baht per unit (about NT$2.02).
The Shay Buri Dam has caused water and food safety controversy since its inception, as the upper reaches of the Mekong River have 11 dams built by the Chinese government in China, which will affect millions of downstream countries, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Concerns about the livelihood of the people. The Shay Buri Dam is funded and built by Thai banks and companies. It costs 135 billion baht (about NT$136.41 billion) and has a construction period of 9 years.
The village of Ban Namprai, which is based in Thailand and relies on fishing, is experiencing the most arid year in history. According to Reuters, the villagers said that the Mekong River usually has a river height of at least 3 meters at the end of the rainy season, and the villagers will hold a dragon boat race at this time. However, this year's dragon boat race was cancelled because the water level was too low. Local fishermen pointed out that during the trial operation of the Sayaburi dam in March this year, they also observed instability of river flow that could not be explained purely through drought.
CK Power, the Thai company responsible for the development of the Sayaburi dam, said the reason for the dryness of the Mekong River was due to the delayed arrival of the rainy season this year and the dam built by upstream China.
Laos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia. Due to the poor nature of the land, it is committed to becoming a ""battery in Asia."" Laos currently has 44 hydropower plants in operation and 46 are under construction.

Indonesia|Investigate illegal export, nickel mine export ban without warning
Nickel-exporting country Indonesia announced on October 28 that there was no warning to announce that the nickel ore export ban, which was originally scheduled to come into force on January 1, 2020, was implemented immediately after an agreement was reached with the industry. On the next day, the Indonesian government changed its position and said that the cessation of exports is an investigation into the recent violation of export quotas. It is expected that nickel ore exports will resume within one to two weeks after the investigation is completed.
The Indonesian government announced on September 2 that it would stop exporting nickel metal by 2020, two years earlier than the original 2022. Bambang Gatot Ariyono, an official with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said that Indonesia needs 81 million tons of nickel ore per year, while domestic nickel reserves are limited. The proven nickel mine has only 698 million metric tons left and can only be used 7 times. In the past eight years, in order to accelerate the establishment of the domestic smelting industry, and because nickel is a raw material for lithium batteries, the ban was issued for the development of the electric vehicle industry. As soon as the policy was announced, the amount of nickel ore in the London Metal Exchange (LME) hit a new high of nearly five years, reaching $18,850 per metric ton.
According to the statement of the Investment Coordination Committee Chairman Bahlil Lahadalia on the 28th, the ban was implemented not directly by the government, but the agreement reached between the domestic nickel mining industry association and the government, and agreed to stop the nickel ore export immediately. On the 29th, Luhut Pandjaitan, the Minister of Mines and Maritime Coordination, pointed out that since the announcement of the 2020 export policy in September, the domestic nickel ore export volume has increased significantly, and there may be violations, so the export is temporarily suspended. The relevant departments such as the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Customs Bureau will conduct investigations and resume normal exports in one to two weeks. The ban will remain in force until 2020.


Indonesia has no warning to announce the cessation of export of nickel ore, and the cost of stainless steel has risen to promote the speed of local factories in Taiwan.

Vietnam|Taiwan MRT trial and traffic, working hard at the end of the year
The first MRT line in Hanoi, the ""Jiling-Hedong Line"", began trial operation on October 28 and will begin a 20-day test phase to test all 13 trains and be supervised by the state-owned Hanoi MRT Corporation.
Hanoi has been planning the construction of the MRT since 2008, including 9 routes with a total length of 410 km, of which 342 km are elevated and 68 km are underground. The first line 2A, the route from Cat Linh to Ha Dongong (Ha Đong) is 13 kilometers long and 12 stations, also known as the ""Jiling - Hedong Line"".
The construction of the Jiling-Hedong Line began in October 2011 and was originally scheduled to be completed in 2013. The plan was extended to the third quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. However, the construction period was delayed again. The first test was carried out in September 2018. It was originally expected to be open to traffic after 3 to 6 months, and delayed for more than one year. Construction funds have also doubled from the original 377 million US dollars to 868 million US dollars (about 26 billion Taiwan dollars), of which 670 million US dollars of funds are from China.
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung told the media in early October that he will definitely open the Hanoi MRT to this year and revealed that the MRT project has been completed 99%, only the China Railway Sixth Bureau Group and the Ministry of Communications Nguyen Van The, the Minister of Transportation, said that it is expected to be completed within 30 to 45 days. However, Apave-Certifier-Tricc, a consultancy firm of MRT Engineering, said that the overall safety assessment should take six months, and I am afraid that it will not operate as scheduled at the end of this year.
This month, the Hanoi authorities may extend the Jiling-Hedong line to Xuan Mai in the southwest of Hanoi, extending from 14 kilometers to 34 kilometers. Other lines are also planned to be extended. The second MRT Line/Nhon-Hanoi, which was originally scheduled to operate in 2017, is expected to be delayed until the end of 2020. The first batch of cars will be delivered in July next year. Maintained $1.3 billion planned for 2014.

Thailand|Thai government disregards US opposition and passes three pesticide bans
The National Committee on Hazardous Substances passed a ban on three pesticides on October 22, including two herbicides, paraquat and glyphosate, and chlorpyrifos. Insecticide will take effect on December 1. These three pesticides will be listed as the fourth category of hazardous substances in Thailand, and the three pesticides will not be manufactured, imported, transferred, or held in Thailand.
According to Reuters, the ban itself did not extend to agricultural products, but farmers' groups opposed to the pesticide ban pointed out that they called on Thailand to ban any imports of crops from countries that use three pesticides, including the United States. The media disclosed on October 25 a letter from the US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Ted McKinney to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, which asked Thailand to suspend the implementation of the herbicide for Jiaphos. The ban. McKinney pointed out that if the ban is implemented, it will seriously affect the import of agricultural raw materials such as US soybeans and US wheat, and therefore calls on Thailand to maintain the current review criteria for limiting pesticide residues. In addition, the US also condemned the Thai government for banned Jiaphosé without sufficient scientific evidence to support it.
Thai Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul responded immediately on October 25th. The United States only cares about trade, while the Thai government is concerned about the health of Thai consumers. He said, ""The United States is worried that it will not be able to sell their products in the future, and therefore requires us to lift the ban. Should we bow to the US action?"" He said that 29 experts from the Hazardous Materials Committee had already reached a consensus on the ban. The advantages and disadvantages of the ban have been studied for some time.
Thailand currently imports about 7.32 billion baht (about NT$73.941 billion) of agricultural products to the United States each year, while Jiaphosse is a pesticide developed by the US agricultural biotechnology giant Monsanto and sold through the Roundup brand. .

Malaysia|1MDB key figure Liu Tezuo and the US Department of Justice reconciled and agreed to give up more than $700 million in assets
The US Department of Justice said on October 30 that it had reached a settlement with Jho Low, a key figure in the Malaysian Development Corporation (1MDB) fraud, and Liu Tezuo agreed to abandon the US government’s attempt to seize more than $700 million in assets. Includes a Beverly Hills hotel and a private jet.
US federal prosecutor Nick Hanna pointed out that Liu Tezo was suspected of using the large sums of money stolen from a Malaysian development company to wash money by purchasing expensive assets from many countries, including the United States. ""Thanks to the settlement agreement, allegedly One of the core figures in this large-scale project will not be able to use hundreds of millions of dollars."" Brian Benczkowski, head of the criminal case department at the US Department of Justice, also pointed out that the agreement shows that the United States will not be a safe haven for corruption. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and will become the largest civil concession agreement in US history once the court agrees.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mahathir said on the 31st that the illegally purchased assets of Liu Tezuo were bought with the money of the Malaysian people. ""We can prove that this is Malaysian money"" and therefore will ask the US government for money. Liu Tezuo is still a fugitive of the United States, and may be hiding in countries such as China or the Middle East. The 1MDB case caused widespread public grievances after exposure in 2015, which was one of the main reasons for the Najib government's 2018 election.

Singapore & Malaysia|Singapore and Malaysia Airlines formally reached an agreement to expand the shared class number
Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines announced on October 30 that bilateral cooperation has officially signed a cooperation agreement to expand the sharing class. In the future, it will increase the service route of the shared class and joint marketing to promote the tourism and tourism of Singapore.
Since the signing of the memorandum of understanding between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines on June 27 this year, bilateral negotiations have strengthened the formal agreement on the cooperation between the two airlines. After more than four months of negotiations, the agreement has finally been formally reached. The agreement enables Singapore Airlines and its subsidiary, SikeAir, to operate a shared line with Malaysia Airlines to fly to 16 airports in Malaysia, such as Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu, and Langkawi. In addition, the two companies will also use the shared class mechanism to strengthen their operations to international routes such as Europe and South Africa.
According to the Lianhe Zaobao editorial, although Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines belong to different aviation alliances, in fact, after the separation in 1972, the Singapore-based route to Singapore was used as a shared class to become the basis for the expansion of cooperation between the two airlines. The route to the two capitals is one of the busiest international routes in the world. More than 30,000 flights and 4 million passengers a year are the result of cooperation and open skies between the two countries. Nowadays, the expansion of the cooperation of the shared class will increase the number of passengers on other routes.
Since Malaysia Airlines has suffered long-term losses since the 1997 Asian financial turmoil, and the two air disasters in 2014 have caused Malaysian national aviation operations to be in trouble, in recent years, the news that the government will shut down or resell Malaysia Airlines will continue. Dalai Zhou just announced that he has locked in four potential companies that may invest. He is actively working with other airlines through a shared class mechanism, hoping to improve his business. For example, he just announced a joint class agreement with British Airways in October. Covers flights to 14 airports.
