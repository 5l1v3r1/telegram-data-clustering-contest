      <p>Thwomps are possibly my favourite enemy in the <i>Mario</i> universe. They look cool and seem tough, but the other thing I love is their name. Thowmps. It is just fun to say. Just fun enemy all around, so let’s make some levels featuring these great enemies.</p>
      <p><b>Your Challenge This Week</b>: Create levels featuring Thwomps!</p>
      <p><b>Theme:</b> Thwomps, Thwomp, Too Many Thwomps</p>
      <p>Use any style you want and make the levels as long or short as you desire. The only important thing is to make sure you include some Thwomps. How many? I don’t know, but try to include more than one. You can never have too many Thwomps. (I was just informed that you can, in fact, have too many Thwomps. Sorry.)</p>
      <p>Next week I’ll pick some of my favourite courses and a winner.</p>
      <blockquote><b>How To Submit A Level — Instructions<br/></b><br/>1. Build a new course based on the challenge.<br/><br/>2. Name the level and please add “<i>Kotaku</i>”<b> </b><b><i>AND</i></b><b> /</b> <b><i>OR</i></b><b> </b>the theme this week into the name of the level. Once that’s done, upload it in <i>Super Mario Maker 2</i> for the Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/>3. Then post the course ID into the comments, along with the name of the level and any other info you want to include. <b>PLEASE</b> include the name of the course in the comments.</blockquote>
