      <h1>Teams make progress against latest major California blaze</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T05:53:48+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 05:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Firefighters in California made progress Saturday containing a sizable new blaze in the southern part of the state as they continued to battle a much larger fire in the north.</p>
      <p>The so-called Maria Fire broke out Thursday in bone-dry conditions in Ventura County, 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, sending thousands of people fleeing and endangering more than 2,500 structures.</p>
      <p>It had spread to 9,412 acres (3,808 hectares) by Saturday evening, California fire officials said but was 30 per cent contained.</p>
      <p>That progress came despite the forced grounding overnight of firefighting helicopters after at least two hobby drones were seen operating in the area, posing a risk of collision, officials said.</p>

      <p>The Ventura County Fire Department warned on Twitter that “even a tiny drone can cause a serious or fatal accident if it collides with firefighting aircraft.”</p>
      <p>In Sonoma County north of San Francisco, the Kincade Fire – the largest in the state this season – was continuing to burn over 77,758 acres on Saturday evening and was 74 per cent contained, state officials said.</p>
      <p>The fires prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to declare an emergency across the state, parts of which have not had rainfall for months.</p>
      <p>An extreme red-flag warning issued for the Los Angeles area this week was lifted Thursday but the National Weather Service warned that so-called Santa Ana winds could still wreak havoc through Saturday evening.</p>

      <p>The state’s largest utility company, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, has been shutting off power to millions of customers in northern and central California, reducing fire risks but provoking public outrage.</p>
      <p>Last year’s Camp Fire destroyed the northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people. Similar blazes in the area the previous year killed 44 people.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, the past two weeks have brought no fatalities even as hurricane-force winds have fanned fierce blazes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.</p>
      <p>Authorities credited repeated warnings on radio and TV, PG&amp;E’s precautionary power shut-offs, the pre-positioning of firefighters in high-risk forests, and more sophisticated weather-prediction capabilities than in past years.</p>
