興趣變工作又很成功　他卻說是人生最慘的事

「最慘的事情是興趣變成了工作，音樂、演唱會啊，對大多數人來說是休閒活動，但對我來說再也不是休閒了，永遠都不會是。」史蒂潘卡薩彥（Stepan Kazaryan）說。



史蒂潘5年前創辦了莫斯科音樂週（Moscow Music Week，簡稱MMW），雖然辦得很成功，卻讓他壓力很大。他說：「一旦以舉辦演唱會為業，便再也無法從觀賞藝人的現場演出而得到樂趣。不管是我經手或其他人辦的，再也無法專注欣賞音樂。」
取而代之的，他只想到要計算參加人數、觀察人們的情緒反應等等。假如某場演唱會成功了，他才會得到樂趣。如果不是那麼成功，但它仍是一場好的表演，只不過參加的人不多，那麼這場演唱會就不會帶給他任何感覺。不過，就算是一場很成功的演唱會，他也無法與音樂產生共鳴，「就只是一份工作而已。」
史蒂潘強調，他還是能分辨一場演唱會的好壞，只是聽演唱會這件事再不能觸動他的情感，他只有「這音樂會很棒」或「這個歌手很有天份」等等的想法。


史蒂潘表示，音樂是他生命中不可或缺的事物。

他不諱言，創辦MMW前，他對音樂很有熱情。現在的他仍視音樂為生命中不可或缺之事，在家裡也會聽，但已經很難從演唱會現場感受到特定的情感，「很快就會厭煩。」如今，愛吃也愛做菜的他，閒暇時最常下廚，或者收看與歷史地理相關的書籍或節目。
雖然演唱會已引不起他的興趣，所幸挖掘有潛力的新人，仍令他感到振奮。他說：「對我來說就像挖礦工人挖到金子般。當人們在尋覓、且找到他要的東西時，是會很開心的。」

""The worst thing is that interest has become a job, music, concerts, leisure activities for most people, but it is no longer casual for me, never will be."" Stefan Casa Stepan Kazaryan said.



Stefan founded Moscow Music Week (MMW) five years ago, and although it was successful, it put him under great pressure. He said: ""Once you start a concert, you will never be able to enjoy the live performances of the artists. Whether it is handled by me or someone else, I can no longer concentrate on listening to music.""
Instead, he only thought of calculating the number of participants, observing people's emotional reactions, and so on. If a concert is successful, he will have fun. If it is not so successful, but it is still a good performance, but there are not many people participating, then this concert will not bring him any feeling. However, even if it is a very successful concert, he can't resonate with music. ""It's just a job.""
Stefan stressed that he can still distinguish the quality of a concert. He just can't touch his emotions when he listens to the concert. He only has ""this concert is great"" or ""this singer is very talented"" and so on. Thoughts.


Stepan said that music is an indispensable part of his life.

He did not say that he was very passionate about music before he founded MMW. Now he still regards music as an indispensable thing in his life, he will listen at home, but it is difficult to feel the specific emotion from the concert scene. ""It will soon get bored."" Now, love and love to do He is the one who cooks most often in his spare time, or watches books or programs related to historical geography.
Although the concert has not attracted his interest, he is fortunate to find out the potential newcomers. He said: ""For me, it is like a mining worker who digs into gold. When people are looking for and finding what they want, they will be very happy.""
