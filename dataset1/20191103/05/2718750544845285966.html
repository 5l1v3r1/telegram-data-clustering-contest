      <h1><i>SNL</i> Rightfully Continues Canine Antics With Hero-Dog Sketch</h1>

      <p>Someone over at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/saturday-night-live/"><i>SNL</i></a><i> </i>has made the correct choice, and the brave choice, to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-dog-court-cecily-strong-david-harbour.html#comments">feature dogs</a> in sketches in two episodes this season. And oh, what a debt we owe to them. Reoccurring bits on <i>SNL </i>have the difficult job of walking the line between repetitive and charming, but somehow, watching a dog clearly misunderstand the concept of live television never gets less delightful. This week, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/snl-cecily-strong-goes-for-emmy-gold-with-jeanine-pirro.html">Cecily Strong</a> played a dog translator for Conan, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/conan-military-dog-send-care-package-delta-force-syria-2019-10">K-9 officer</a> who aided in a terrorist raid in Syria. Strong is valiant in her efforts to keep this giant dog from moving around on what is clearly a flimsy prop podium, but the giant dog is determined to do what he wants to do, which is be a gentle agent of chaos. Someone also made the — again, correct — call to mic Conan the dog, because we can hear his quiet grumbles throughout the sketch. We are all the better for it.</p>
