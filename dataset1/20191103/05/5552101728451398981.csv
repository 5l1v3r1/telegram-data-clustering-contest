世界盃讓人愛上俄羅斯？　他申請補助遭拒理由很傻眼
03 Nov 2019, 05:26 by 祁玲, 陳廷豐, 林雅菁
莫斯科音樂週 （Moscow Music Week，簡稱MMW）成立至今，官方沒有給予任何資源，其中8成5至9成的預算來自於門票收入，其餘來自廠商贊助。創辦人史蒂潘卡薩彥（Stepan Kazaryan）直言，有官方補助固然好，但卻無法保證音樂節的品質。



他說：「如果你有百分之百官方補助，想要辦論壇和showcase音樂節當然沒問題。然而我只在亞洲看過以這種方式運作，且這些音樂節都辦得很差。你會察覺到承辦者不去思考：是否有人需要這個音樂節？」
史蒂潘強調，在歐洲，政府可能會補助30%左右的預算，從旁協助，但不會為主辦方扛下所有的財務風險。主辦方不需負風險並不好，因為他們會忘記舉辦音樂節的初衷。「這活動當然是為了歌手或樂團，但也為了觀眾，樂團需要觀眾，後者才是評判音樂節優劣的人。」
過去他嘗試向莫斯科市政府提出補助計畫案，但被拒絕了，原因是官方不理解為什麼莫斯科需要音樂節。於是史蒂潘向他們解釋，這有助於提升城市形象和名氣，「但他們說莫斯科有900年的歷史，已經很有名了。大家都知道莫斯科啊，看看世界盃足球賽，大家都愛俄羅斯…。」讓他很傻言。
倒是莫斯科會把文化預算投在像蜂蜜節（Festival of Honey）這樣的活動，讓大家展示自家生產的蜂蜜，以及所有和蜂蜜相關的事物。他無奈說：「我不想說那不是文化，但那只是蜂蜜，真的很荒謬。」
他舉例，俄羅斯有些地方政府補助的活動就很有趣，比方聖彼得堡市政府補助的SKIF（Sergei Kuryokhin International Festival “SKIF”）是公認很前衛的音樂節，便是很好的例子。

不過史蒂潘也強調，世道在變。如今莫斯科文化局官員已有年輕的一代， 他們了解音樂節有存在必要，但仍要花一段時間才有辦法突破現狀。「有些人理解，但沒有權力說服他的上司，相信假以時日會有所改變。」

The World Cup makes people fall in love with Russia? His reason for applying for a subsidy was disgusting.

Since the establishment of Moscow Music Week (MMW), the official has not given any resources, of which 85% to 90% of the budget comes from ticket sales, and the rest comes from vendor sponsorship. Founder Stepan Kazaryan bluntly said that official subsidies are good, but there is no guarantee of the quality of the festival.



He said: ""If you have 100% official subsidy, it is certainly no problem to have a forum and showcase music festival. However, I have only seen it in this way in Asia, and these festivals are very poor. You will notice the hosting. Don't think about it: Does anyone need this festival?""
Stupin stressed that in Europe, the government may subsidize about 30% of the budget, assisting from the side, but will not leave all financial risks for the organizers. It is not good for the organizers not to take risks, because they will forget the original intention of the festival. ""This event is of course for singers or orchestras, but also for the audience. The orchestra needs the audience. The latter is the person who judges the merits of the festival.""
In the past he tried to submit a subsidy plan to the Moscow city government, but was rejected because the official did not understand why Moscow needed a music festival. So Stepan explained to them that it helps to enhance the image and fame of the city. ""But they say that Moscow has a history of 900 years and it is already very famous. Everyone knows that Moscow, look at the World Cup, everyone loves it. Russia..."" Let him be stupid.
Instead, Moscow will cast its cultural budget on activities like the Festival of Honey, where everyone will showcase their own honey and all the things related to honey. He said helplessly: ""I don't want to say that it is not culture, but it is just honey, it is really ridiculous.""
For example, the activities of government subsidies in some localities in Russia are very interesting. For example, the SKIF (Sergei Kuryokhin International Festival “SKIF”) subsidized by the St. Petersburg Municipal Government is a well-known avant-garde music festival, which is a good example.

But Stepan also stressed that the world is changing. Nowadays, officials of the Moscow Cultural Bureau have a younger generation. They understand that there is a need for a music festival, but it still takes a while to break through the status quo. ""Some people understand, but have no power to convince his superiors that they will change in time.""
