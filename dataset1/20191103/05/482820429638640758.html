      <p>An anonymous reader quotes ZDNet: <i>Linus Torvalds, Linux's creator, doesn't make speeches anymore. But, what he does do, and he did again at Open Source Summit Europe in Lyon France is have public conversations with his friend Dirk Hohndel, VMware's Chief Open Source Officer. In this keynote discussion, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-im-not-a-programmer-anymore/">Torvalds revealed that he doesn't think he's a programmer anymore</a>. <br/><br/>So what does the person everyone thinks of as a programmer's programmer do instead? Torvalds explained: <br/><br/><i>"I don't know coding at all anymore. Most of the code I write is in my e-mails. So somebody sends me a patch ... I [reply with] pseudo code. I'm so used to editing patches now I sometimes edit patches and send out the patch without having ever tested it. I literally wrote it in the mail and say, 'I think this is how it should be done,' but this is what I do, I am not a programmer."</i> <br/><br/>So, Hohndel asked, "What is your job?" Torvalds replied, "I read and write a lot of email. My job really is, in the end, is to say 'no.' Somebody has to say 'no' to [this patch or that pull request]. And because developers know that if they do something that I'll say 'no' to, they do a better job of writing the code."</i></p>
