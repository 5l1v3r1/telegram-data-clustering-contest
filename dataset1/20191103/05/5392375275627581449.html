      <p>A <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/22/motorola-one-hyper-could-be-motorolas-first-pop-up-phone/">Motorola smartphone with a pop-up camera setup</a> may soon become a reality, as speculated a few weeks ago. Motorola hasn’t confirmed the existence or not of the device, but we could say the device dubbed the Motorola One Hyper is a step closer to its official launch.</p>
      <p>The NBTC in Thailand has not cleared the device to launch in the country. The listing officially <a href="https://www.droidshout.com/motorola-one-hyper-xt-2027-3-gets-nbtc-certification/">confirm</a>s the Motorola One Hyper moniker, but sadly doesn’t dwell on the handsets’ specs, but does suggest its official debut might not be far off.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the specs, and internal details, reports from a few weeks back say the Motorola One Hyper will launch as Motorola’s first smartphone with a pop-up camera module. It features a 6.39″ notch-less IPS LCD display having FHD+ resolution. It will be powered by a Snapdragon 675 SoC with 4GB RAM and 128GB storage, while a 3,600 mAh battery will keep the light on.</p>
      <p>Designwise, the device is free of any notch with a full-screen design, all thanks to its pop-up camera module housing a 32-megapixel selfie camera with an f/2.0 lens. It gets a fingerprint scanner under, as well as a dual-camera setup on the flip side.</p>
      <p>And speaking of camera details, reports say the device will get a 64-megapixel primary camera on the back with an f/1.8 lens, coupled with an 8-megapixel depth-sensing camera with an f/2.2 aperture. It can record 4K videos at 30fps, full-HD videos at up to 60fps, slo-mo videos at 120fps in 1080p resolution and at 240fps in 720p resolution. Also, the device has a dedicated Night Vision mode for low-light photography.</p>
