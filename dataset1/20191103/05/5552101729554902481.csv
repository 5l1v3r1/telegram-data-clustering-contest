辦音樂節失敗風險有多大？　他說比玩俄羅斯輪盤還高
03 Nov 2019, 05:26 by 祁玲, 陳廷豐, 林雅菁
「我記得俄羅斯輪盤的遊戲是這樣玩的：在可容納7顆子彈的手槍彈匣裡只放一顆，因此被手槍射到的機率是1/7。但舉辦音樂節就像在手槍裡放4、5顆子彈，失敗的機率高達4/7或5/7，是像在走滑波般、風險很大的工作。」



莫斯科音樂週（Moscow Music Week，簡稱MMW）創辦人史蒂潘卡薩彥（Stepan Kazaryan）接受本刊專訪，請他以過來人經驗提供建議，供有意舉辦音樂節的人士參考時，史蒂潘除了分享上述心得，還強調：「這並不好玩，你可能會過得很悲慘。」

他坦言，音樂節的舉辦人不但不會從中得到任何樂趣，還會有很多壓力。「有時一定會賠錢，最後有可能會結束，毀了你的生活，且沒有人會稱讚你。」
史蒂潘說明：「我做莫斯科音樂週，多少算是做成功的了，至少目前為止的報導都沒有太差。不過，萬一如果不小心出了什麼差錯的話，也許幾年後大家就會忘記我。」
他強調，如果有人因為熱愛音樂，或是想成就一個更好的世界，他奉勸那個人不要做音樂節。如果相信它具有社會使命，非做不可，那可以去試試，不過要很小心，因為出差錯的機率很大，也有可能得不到樂團或歌手的諒解。

""I remember the Russian roulette game is like this: only one in the pistol magazine that can hold 7 bullets, so the chance of being shot by a pistol is 1/7. But the music festival is like in a pistol. Putting 4 or 5 bullets, the chance of failure is as high as 4/7 or 5/7, which is like a slippery, risky job.""



Stepan Kazaryan, founder of Moscow Music Week (MMW), accepted an exclusive interview with the magazine and asked him to provide suggestions for people who want to hold a music festival. Sharing the above tips, I also stressed: ""This is not fun, you may be very miserable.""


Stepan believes that the chances of making a music festival are very high, and there may be no understanding of the orchestra or singer. (provided by MMW)

He admits that the organizers of the festival will not only have no fun, but also a lot of pressure. ""Sometimes you will lose money. In the end, it may end, it will ruin your life, and no one will praise you.""
Stepan explained: ""I am doing a lot of success in Moscow Music Week. At least the reports so far are not too bad. However, if you accidentally make a mistake, maybe you will forget it in a few years. I.""
He stressed that if someone loves music or wants to achieve a better world, he advises that person not to be a music festival. If you believe that it has a social mission, you can try it, but be careful, because the chances of making mistakes are great, and you may not get the understanding of the orchestra or singer.
