      <p>Power producers' total outstanding dues owed by distribution companies rose around 37 per cent to Rs 69,558 crore in September 2019 over the same month last year, reflecting stress in the sector.</p>

      <p>In order to give a relief to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/power-generation">power generation </a>companies, the Centre has enforced a payment security mechanism from August 1. Under this mechanism, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/discoms">discoms </a>are required to open letters of credit for getting power supply.</p>
      <p>Data on the portal indicates that outstanding as well as overdue amount have decreased over the preceding month. In August 2019, total outstanding on discoms was Rs 80,087 crore, while the total overdue amount was Rs 60,935 crore.</p>
      <p>The August 2019 figures of dues and overdues have been revised upwards from Rs 78,020 crore and Rs 59,532 crore provisional numbers released last month on the portal.</p>
      <p>Discoms in Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu account for the major portion of dues to power generating companies, taking a longer duration of up to 881 days to make payments, the portal showed.</p>
      <p>Among major states, Rajasthan tops the list with 881 days to make payments, followed by Haryana (879 days), Tamil Nadu (877 days), Madhya Pradesh (866 days) and Telangana (859 days) in that order.</p>
