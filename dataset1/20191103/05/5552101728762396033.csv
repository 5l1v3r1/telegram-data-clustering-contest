有潛力卻搞不清狀況　他常登門拜託菜鳥參加演出

莫斯科音樂週（Moscow Music Week，簡稱MMW）以發掘新人為宗旨，表演團體有9成是俄羅斯樂團，大部分由創辦人史蒂潘卡薩彥（Stepan Kazaryan）和團隊人員在網路上尋找。他透露，有些樂團不了解這是曝光的好機會，他還得拜託他們來參加。



史蒂潘說：「我們很挑的，雖然每年會收到幾百組藝人報名申請，95%不會被採用。如果能多選一些我會很高興，但他們還不夠好。」
有時他在網路上看到不錯的樂團，會登門拜訪，問他們是否有意願參加MMW。史蒂潘說：「大部分人沒有敏感度，或者不太清醒、過於懶散，沒有體認到參加音樂節可以帶來什麼收穫，我們還得拜託他們來參加。」
MMW的另一個特色是把展演活動依類型區分，從R&B、後龐克搖滾到爵士樂等。理論上，每個類型都設有專責策展人 ，只不過史蒂潘實際上卻承擔了大部分的邀訪工作。
他說：「對外我都聲稱沒有介入策展工作，但有時我的確要負責其中幾個。而且老實說，有9成的樂團都是我找來的。可能沒有到9成啦，我太誇張了，不過絕不少於70%到75%。」
史蒂潘表示，2017年他原本有15個策展人，但活動結束後他解雇了一半。剩下來的策展人做完隔年的活動後，又有一半捲鋪蓋走人。他解釋：「他們沒有做好份內的事，我做得比他們好。原本希望他們分擔我的工作，讓我有時間去處理其他事，結果我反而變成他們的顧問，或做了他們的工作。」

他認為，資深的音樂人對於挖掘潛力新人來說，不見得有敏感度，所以他會找較年輕的策展人，但是「他們不專業又懶散，有時不切實際，很不幸這是我們要冒的風險。」

He has the potential but can’t figure out the situation. He often goes to the door to invite the rookie to participate in the performance.

Moscow Music Week (MMW) aims to discover new people. 90% of the performing groups are Russian orchestras, most of which are found on the Internet by founder Stepan Kazaryan and team members. He revealed that some orchestras did not understand that this was a good opportunity for exposure, and he had to ask them to attend.



Stepan said: ""We are very picky. Although hundreds of artists will apply for registration every year, 95% will not be adopted. I would be happy if I can choose more, but they are not good enough.""
Sometimes he sees a good orchestra on the Internet and will visit and ask if they are willing to participate in MMW. Stepan said: ""Most people are not sensitive, or not sober, too lazy, and do not recognize the benefits of participating in the festival, we have to ask them to participate.""
Another feature of MMW is the distinction between the show's activities, from R&B, post-punk rock to jazz. In theory, each type has a dedicated curator, but Stefan actually assumes most of the invitation work.
He said: ""I have claimed that I have not been involved in curating work, but sometimes I am responsible for a few of them. And to be honest, 90% of the orchestras are all I have found. Maybe not 90%, I am too Exaggerated, but not less than 70% to 75%.""
Stefan said that he had 15 curators in 2017, but he was fired half after the event. After the remaining curators finished the activities of the next year, half of the rolls were covered. He explained: ""They didn't do the job well. I did better than them. I wanted them to share my work and let me have time to deal with other things. As a result, I became their consultants or made them. jobs.""

He believes that senior musicians are not necessarily sensitive to potential newcomers, so he will look for younger curators, but ""they are unprofessional and lazy, sometimes unrealistic, unfortunately this is us. The risk to take.""
