A military convoy, including a personnel carrier armored vehicle, a mine flail and a utility vehicle, dispatched by the US, arrived in Jazira base located west of Raqqa province via the northeastern Syrian province of Al-Hasakah.
Nearly 30 US soldiers were also seen in the convoy heading to Jazira base.

Ankara and Moscow reached a deal under which YPG/PKK terrorists will pull back 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) south of Turkey’s border with northern Syria within 150 hours, and security forces from Turkey and Russia will conduct joint patrols there.
In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and the European Union – has been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the Syrian offshoot of the PKK.
