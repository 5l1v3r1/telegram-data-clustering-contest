巴西浮油汙染困擾3個月 擴及座頭鯨保育區

03 Nov 2019, 05:42

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】困擾巴西海岸3個月的浮油汙染，目前已飄到座頭鯨保育區。巴西海軍2日通報說，這將嚴重汙染生物多樣性豐富的群島地區，背後的環境及經濟破壞目前還無法量化。
3個月前，油污出現在巴西東北部外海，令巴西著名2000公里海岸線上的200多個海灘遭到油漬汙染。環保人士先前就擔心油汙會飄至阿布羅略斯群島，漁民及志工也都站崗監督。
巴西東北巴伊亞州（Bahia）外海阿布羅略斯（Abrolhos）群島四周，有著巴西最豐富的海洋多樣性。群島中一座國家公園有著罕見珊瑚群、海鳥以及座頭鯨繁殖地。
海軍在聲明中表示，海軍船艦清理的油汙有部分在海洋中，有部分則在海灘上。而船員及志工已在海灘上清出數噸重的原油。
巴西政府1日點名一艘從委內瑞拉載石油前往新加坡、掛有希臘旗幟的油輪布普林納號（Bouboulina）是主要嫌疑犯。
巴西國家太空署（Inpe）1日表示，海中仍可能有油汙在洋流推動下，南下至巴西東南的聖靈州（Espiritu Santo）及里約熱內盧州（Rio De Janeiro）。
巴西官員說，目前還無法量化油漬造成的環境及經濟破壞。

Brazil oil pollution has been plagued for 3 months and expanded to the humpback whale conservation area

03 Nov 2019, 05:42

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The oil pollution that has plagued the Brazilian coast for three months has now flown to the humpback whale conservation area. The Brazilian Navy reported on the 2nd that it will seriously pollute the biodiversity-rich archipelago region, and the environmental and economic damage behind it is still not quantifiable.
Three months ago, oil spilled out of the northeastern part of Brazil, contaminating more than 200 beaches on Brazil's famous 2,000-kilometer coastline. Environmentalists have previously worried that oil will drift to the Abros Islands, and fishermen and volunteers are also supervised.
Surrounded by the Abrolhos archipelago off the coast of Bahia in northeastern Brazil, Brazil has the richest marine diversity in Brazil. A national park in the archipelago has rare coral colonies, seabirds and humpback breeding grounds.
The Navy said in a statement that the oil that was cleaned by the Navy ships was partly in the ocean and some on the beach. The crew and volunteers have cleared tons of crude oil on the beach.
On the 1st, the Brazilian government named the oil tanker Bouboulina, which carries oil from Venezuela to Singapore and has the Greek flag, is the main suspect.
The Brazilian National Space Agency (Inpe) said on the 1st that there may still be oil in the sea, driven by ocean currents, to the south of Brazil in the state of Espiritu Santo and Rio De Janeiro.
Brazilian officials say it is not yet possible to quantify the environmental and economic damage caused by oil stains.
