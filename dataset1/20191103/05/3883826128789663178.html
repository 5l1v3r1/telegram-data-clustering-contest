        <figcaption>Mr Johnson faces what the Sunday Times calls a "double threat" to his hopes of winning a Commons majority - Labour enjoying a bounce in the polls and Remain parties finalising an election pact to thwart him. The paper says the prospect of the election campaign becoming a two-horse race will unnerve Tory strategists.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday Telegraph reports comments from Conservative chairman James Cleverly that said some British Jewish people he knows would leave the UK if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister, amid the row about Labour's handling of anti-Semitism claims in the party. It also joins several papers in marking England's defeat in the Rugby World Cup final by featuring a photo of the dejected-looking squad on its front page. "England's agony" is its headline.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The prime minister has told the Sunday Express that an election victory for the Tories could lead to Brexit being wrapped up in days. Referring to his Brexit deal, Mr Johnson tells the paper: "You could put it in Gas Mark 4, 20 minutes and Bob's your uncle."</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Prince Charles has become embroiled in what the Mail on Sunday calls a "major art scandal" following allegations that a painting at one of his stately homes is a fake and not the Â£50m Monet it was claimed to be. An American forger says he, and not the 19th century French impressionist, painted the image hung at Dumfries House.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Pictures of the body of Amelia Bambridge, who died in Cambodia after accidentally drowning, have appeared on social media, reports the Sunday Mirror. The paper says Facebook and sister company Instagram have removed some of the images, but others remain.</figcaption>

        <b>"England's agony" declares a front-page headline in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/11/02/eddie-jones-loss-explain-englands-world-cup-final-capitulation/">Sunday Telegraph</a>, above an image of members of the England rugby team, moments after their World Cup defeat in Japan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Crushed" is the verdict of the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/">Sunday Times</a>, while the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/">Sunday Express</a> says England simply found no answers to the Springboks' power play.</p>

      <p>The Sunday People says the hammering left Eddie Jones - "the coach with an answer for everything" - with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/rugby-world-cup-final-eddie-20800545">no explanation</a> for the way in which his side were mauled by "the unstoppable power" of South Africa.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/02/england-south-africa-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report">the Observer</a> says even the most despondent England fan could take comfort in the fact they were witnessing history.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/">the Sun</a>, captain Siya Kolisi's journey from poverty to sporting greatness marked a "seismic moment" for South Africa.</p>
      <h3>'Spending taps'</h3>
      <p>The Sunday Express <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1199313/Brexit-latest-Boris-Johnson-general-election-interview">devotes its front page to an interview with Boris Johnson</a>, in which he promises to drive through his Brexit deal at full speed, if he wins the general election.</p>
      <p>He tells the paper he'll get "Brexit wrapped up fast".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10268338/boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-christmas-stuffing/">The Sun</a> says the suggestion that Britain could be out of the EU - "before the Christmas turkey is cooked" - should be "music to the ears" of voters, sick of more than three years of political in-fighting.</p>
      <p>However, the Sunday Times <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/general-election-poll-double-trouble-for-boris-johnson-after-bounce-in-corbyn-support-and-remain-electoral-pact-0nbttwvwd">detects signs of Tory nervousness</a> in the face of what it calls a recent Labour bounce in support.</p>
      <p>It adds that the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party are set to reveal a Remain pact in up to 60 seats, in an effort to deny Mr Johnson a majority.</p>

      <p>In a nod to the uncertainty surrounding the election, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/31/matt-cartoons-november-2019/">Matt cartoon</a> in the Telegraph shows an amateur psephologist holding forth in a pub.</p>
      <p>"If the Not Sures refuse a Pact with the Don't Knows, it could split the Undivided Vote," is his prediction.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7643255/Tories-turn-spending-taps-Boris-Johnson-promises-5bn-boost-pensions-welfare.html">Tories turn on the spending taps</a>," runs a headline in the Mail on Sunday, in its coverage of the government's plans to end the benefits freeze from April.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/">Sunday Times</a>, says the spending commitment - to be accompanied by a rise in the state pension - is aimed squarely at blue-collar workers.</p>
      <p>It reports that Mr Johnson's senior aide, Dominic Cummings, has told colleagues that "people are hurting", and if the Conservatives are to pick up seats in Leave areas in the north, they have to do more to help the working poor.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7643255/Tories-turn-spending-taps-Boris-Johnson-promises-5bn-boost-pensions-welfare.html">Mail on Sunday suggests the plans</a> to ditch the last remnants of David Cameron's austerity drive could mean trouble ahead.</p>
      <p>The paper reports that the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, has privately expressed concern that the expensive set of manifesto policies could "drastically" reduce his room for manoeuvre to deliver tax cuts for traditional Tory voters.</p>
      <h3>'Great untapped properties'</h3>
      <p>The Sunday Mirror predicts that Labour's plans to insulate millions of homes across the country could <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-pledges-make-27-20797568">create 450,000 construction jobs</a>, as workers fit the loft insulation, solar power and double glazing needed.</p>
      <p>According to the Sunday Telegraph, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/02/labour-vows-turn-every-home-uk-energy-efficient-create-450000/">scheme aims to eradicate the vast majority of fuel poverty</a> by the middle of the next decade.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Sunday Times says the prospective sale of the Daily Telegraph has attracted unexpected interest from America.</p>
      <p>It claims that Steve Bannon - the controversial mastermind of Donald Trump's presidential campaign - <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/trump-guru-steve-bannon-eyes-daily-telegraph-purchase-ktkz82rfb">wants to put together a consortium to turn the newspaper into a global voice "promoting populist nationalism"</a>.</p>
      <p>The Telegraph is one of the "great untapped properties," the Times quotes Mr Bannon as saying.</p>
      <p>But the paper says it is less clear whether the former White House strategist can come up with the nine-figure asking price.</p>
