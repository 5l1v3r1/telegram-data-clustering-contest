【獨家】福茂氣不過合約風波　怒打電話封殺韋禮安

韋禮安與老東家福茂唱片之間的合約風波，剪不斷理還亂。近日更傳出福茂唱片老闆張耕宇怒氣難洩，親自打電話給各大唱片公司高層，告知「勿與韋禮安合作」，企圖全面封殺韋禮安。此招似乎見效，據傳原欲與韋禮安合作的華納唱片，因此緊急剎車，一切停擺。
去年9月初，韋禮安在臉書宣布與合作十年的福茂唱片約滿。他文情並茂寫著：「沒有福茂就沒有今天的韋禮安，接下來的道路就是自己的課題了。只有更努力的做好音樂才不負這些年的栽培，現在的道別，只是為了未來更好的相遇，希望到時我已變得更好。」可惜老東家不買他的帳，堅持提告。
據了解，向來「以和為貴」的韋禮安，對於福茂唱片的封殺令，感到相當難過，畢竟，雙方合作多年，有一定的情感。當年，韋禮安以新人的合約簽給福茂唱片，多年來合約內容未變，就算得了金曲獎最佳新人獎的加持，條件依舊沒變，因此就算撕破臉，他也打算獨自前行。據了解，韋禮安離開福茂唱片一年多來，自己所創造的產值遠超過在福茂10年的累積，近期更展開《而立》巡迴演唱會。

[Exclusive] Fu Mao gas but contract winds angry call to block Wei Li'an
03 Nov 2019, 01:58 by Entertainment Group
The contract between Wei Li'an and the old club, Fu Mao Records, has been continually chaotic. Recently, it was revealed that Zhang Gengyu, the owner of Fumao Records, was so angry that he personally called the top records of major record companies and told him not to cooperate with Wei Li'an in an attempt to completely ban Wei Li'an. This move seems to be effective. It is said that Warner Music, which was originally intended to cooperate with Weili, is therefore in an emergency brake and everything is stopped.
At the beginning of September last year, Wei Li'an was announced on Facebook to share the ten-year-old Fu Mao record. He wrote in a literary and emotional style: ""Without Fumao, there is no today's Wei Li'an. The next road is his own problem. Only by working harder to do the music will not be cultivated for these years. The current goodbye is just for the future. A good meeting, I hope that I have become better by then."" Unfortunately, the old club does not buy his account, insist on the notice.
It is understood that Wei Li'an, who has always been ""to be more expensive"", feels very sad about the ban on Fu Mao Records. After all, the two sides have cooperated for many years and have certain emotions. At that time, Wei Li'an signed the contract with Fumao on the contract of the newcomer. The content of the contract has not changed for many years. Even if he won the Golden Bull Award for Best Newcomer, the conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, even if he tore his face, he intends to go on his own. It is understood that Wei Li'an has left Fumao Records for more than a year, and his output value has far exceeded the accumulation in Fumao for 10 years. Recently, he has also started a concert tour.
