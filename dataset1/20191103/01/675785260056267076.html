      <h2>Katya made the decision after sick online trolls sent dance partner Mike Bushell messages warning he was a "dead man"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T01:11:02+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 01:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Concerned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katya-jones">Kayta Jones</a> has shut down her social media after celebrity dance partner Mike Bushell received <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictly-2019-mike-bushell-sent-20747292">death threats</a> .</p>
      <p>Katya is so angry about about what has been said to the BBC Breakfast host that she is no longer using twitter or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Mike has been told to quit the BBC1 show or be a “dead man”.</p>
      <p>He received the threat hours after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> judge Shirley Ballas saved him over ex-Coronation Street Catherine Tyldesley in last Saturday's dance-off.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Daily Mirror's Pride of Britain Awards, Mike, said: "It said that unless I withdraw from the competition now I'm a dead man.</p>

      <p>"It was personal and I thought WTF. There are bigger things in the world to worry about.</p>
      <p>"I get that people have their own favourite dancers but it's an entertainment show at the end of the day and to get a death threat is ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"My wife saw it first and when I went to see who had sent it, they had already removed the tweet. A death threat? What?! On Strictly?</p>
      <p>"You rise above it but it's people being cowardly isn't it? The show is meant to be happy, make people feel happy."</p>

      <p>Now, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10267242/strictlys-katya-jones-quit-social-media/">The Sun</a> , Katya is quitting social media.</p>
      <p>The dancer, 30, said: “I’m off social media; it’s not real. For me, it’s real what we’re doing with our dancing and performance.</p>
      <p>“There’s no need for negatives. I just want to do my own thing.”</p>
      <p>Mike, 53, added: "We haven't reported it to police because the tweet had already gone. The BBC have been great, really supportive.</p>

      <p>"There were others saying 'f*** off, you've got to pull out of the competition', but you don't quit.</p>
      <p>"I'm fine. As you get older you get thick skinned. I'll just come out fighting harder this week.</p>
      <p>"I totally have time for people that say the judges made the wrong decision. Everyone has their own opinion don't they?</p>
