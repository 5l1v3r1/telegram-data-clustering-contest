      <h1>William Saliba's Arsenal transfer questioned by St Etienne boss Claude Puel</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal are due to welcome William Saliba to the club next summer after his season-long loan back in France</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T01:51:27+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 01:51</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>William Saliba is set to link up with Arsenal in the summer - but Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel has questioned club bosses for their decision to sell the young defender.</p>
      <p>Saliba put pen to paper with the Gunners in July in a £27million deal which saw him immediately head back to France on loan for the season.</p>
      <p>Whilst injuries have limited the centre-back to just six appearances this season, he has made a major impact and shown his class.</p>
      <p>It has led to ex-Leicester boss Puel labelling him their best player despite being just 18-years-old.</p>
      <p>And he branded their decision to sell him to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> before his arrival as "short-term" and "reactionary".</p>

      <p>Using the Saliba transfer as an example to question their business model, Puel told L'Equipe: |It’s done, adopted and I’ve got nothing to say because it helped perform.</p>
      <p>"Saint-Etienne have held their rank these past few years. Finishing fourth is a great result. Work was done in the short-term.</p>
      <p>"Is this model viable? I don’t think it can make the club a success. Rather than buying a ready-made player, I’d rather we buy him to develop him and help him grow.</p>

      <p>"It’s hard to accept that we sell our best player, a young kid, to help fill the coffers.</p>
      <p>"When you have to sell your gems to round up the budget and then do short term deals to fill in the gaps, you’re being reactionary."</p>
      <p>Saliba was recently back in London with Arsenal as part of his recovery from a hamstring injury.</p>

      <p>He watched on in the away end when his new club travelled to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> last month and reportedly impressed club chiefs with his physical prowess.</p>
      <p>They have some concerns over a groin injury and don't consider him yet ready for first-team Premier League action, but he is still being tipped for big things when he joins the club with an extra year of French top flight experience under his belt.</p>
