Football: Patient Brighton beat Norwich 2-0

03 Nov 2019, 01:21

REUTERS: Second-half goals by Leandro Trossard and Shane Duffy earned Brighton & Hove Albion a 2-0 home win over struggling Norwich City on Saturday to move them into the top half of the Premier League table.
Brighton dominated possession but could not find any way through at a windswept Amex Stadium until substitute Trossard poked home Martin Montoya's cross in the 68th minute.

The hosts had gone closest in the first half with Neal Maupay lifting a decent chance over the bar. Norwich keeper Tim Krul, who saved two penalties last week against Manchester United, also produced a great save to deny Steven Alzate.
The visitors were neat and tidy in possession but rarely looked like getting anything once they fell behind and Duffy made sure of the points for Brighton late on.
