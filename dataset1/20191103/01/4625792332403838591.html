      <h1>Matt Gaetz blasts ABC News pundit as 'definition of useless'</h1>

      <p>Rep. Matt Gaetz did not take kindly to a mocking tweet from Matthew Dowd, calling the longtime political strategist "the definition of useless."</p>
      <p>Dowd, who works as a political analyst for ABC News, took aim at the Florida Republican on Friday. "I just want to stick up for Rep. Matt Gaetz, he is definitely not a tool. Tools are useful," he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Hours later, Gaetz fired back. "I was overwhelmingly elected to Congress. Twice. I’ve served nearly a decade in public office, earning voter trust every 2 yrs," he said. "You are appointed by corporate media 2 spread the very nonsense voters rejected when they elected Trump. Your views are the definition of useless."</p>

      <p>Their spat appears to have stemmed from <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-gaetz-ellen-degeneres-show-executive-producer_n_5db75102e4b006d491737b08">a feud between Gaetz and Andy Lassner</a>, executive producer of <i>The Ellen Degeneres Show</i>, who reacted to a tweet the Florida Republican sent out last week with a selfie of himself at the World Series with President Trump and first lady Melania Trump.</p>

      <p>Gaetz, a 37-year-old Florida native who took on a political career following in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rep-matt-gaetz-wants-you-to-know-who-he-is-and-his-plan-is-working/2018/02/20/2dfce71e-126a-11e8-8ea1-c1d91fcec3fe_story.html">footsteps of his father and grandfather</a> and has a 2008 DUI arrest mug shot that his <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2019/02/matt-gaetz-dui-arrest-mugshot/">critics enjoy sharing</a>, has been all over the news lately.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-gaetz-calls-out-democrats-for-not-defending-katie-hill">slammed</a> Democrats for not rallying around Rep. Katie Hill, a California Democrat who last week announced her resignation from Congress after news stories revealing her relationship with a young female campaign staffer and a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-ethics-to-investigate-rep-katie-hills-alleged-romance-with-aide">House Ethics Committee investigation</a> into another alleged romance between Hill and her legislative director.</p>
      <p>Gaetz has also been a leading critic of the House Democrats' impeachment effort against the president. The congressman demonstrated his dismay last month by joining fellow Republicans in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/gop-lawmakers-storm-closed-impeachment-proceeding-and-demand-access">storming</a> a secure hearing room where lawmakers were conducting <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nancy-pelosi-backs-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment proceedings</a> in a protest over access. He also filed a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/ethics-war-brewing-gaetz-files-complaint-against-schiff">complaint</a> against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/schiff-claims-his-summary-of-trumps-call-was-at-least-part-in-parody">opening statement</a> at the only public impeachment hearing so far, in which the California Democrat delivered a parody account of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">Trump’s July 25 phone call</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>Dowd, 58, is a former altar boy who once thought about <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-14-na-dowd14-story.html">becoming a priest</a>. His political career began in Democratic politics, having worked for former Sen. Lloyd Bentson, a Texas Democrat, before becoming a Republican in 1999 and ultimately working for former President George W. Bush as his chief strategist on his successful 2004 reelection campaign. Dowd had a change of heart in 2007 over the Iraq War, leading to him identifying as an independent and becoming a vocal opponent of the two-party system.</p>
      <p>He was a strategist for then-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2006 reelection campaign and later <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/11/01/schwarzenegger-follows-his-passion-maria-follows-hers-a-new-boyfriend/">began dating</a> Maria Shriver, the Kennedy heiress who filed for divorce from Schwarzenegger in 2011 after finding out he fathered a son in an affair with their maid. In 2017, Dowd considered <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-bush-aide-matthew-dowd-considers-cruz-challenge">an independent campaign</a> against Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 election but <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/10/dowd-wont-challenge-cruz-2018/">decided against it</a>.</p>
      <p>Dowd is now a vocal Trump critic. Over the summer he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/matthew-dowd-trumps-divisive-rhetoric-dangerous-democracy-64619221">said</a> Trump's rhetoric is "dangerous to our democracy."</p>
