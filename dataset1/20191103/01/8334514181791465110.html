      <p>ARCADIA, Calif. (Reuters) - Bricks and Mortar edged United by a head to win the $4 million Breeders’ Cup Turf on Saturday, finishing his season undefeated and making a strong case for Horse of the Year honors.</p>
      <p>After being stuck in traffic in the early going, the even-money favorite surged from the outside to overtake United down the stretch and claim his sixth win in six starts this season.</p>
      <p>The win was jockey Irad Ortiz and trainer Chad Brown’s third at the Breeders’ Cup this weekend.</p>
      <p>Longshot United (50-1) had to settle for second and Anthony Van Dyck was third in the 1-1/2 mile race for three-year-olds and up on turf.</p>
      <p>“This is a special horse, he might be the best I’ve ever ridden,” Ortiz said.</p>
      <p>“Today, he was a little keen with me, so we were closer to the pace than normal. So, I just tried to get him to relax. When I asked him to run, I looked behind me and saw we were clear.</p>
      <p>“He saw that other horse in front of us and he fought all the way to the wire.</p>
      <p>“I knew it was very close, but I thought we won it. I’m so happy.”</p>
