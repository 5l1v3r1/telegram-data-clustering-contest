【獨家】黃立成創同志交友平台爆差別待遇　約會1次1萬有人只用1000吃到飽
03 Nov 2019, 01:58 by 娛樂組
本刊近日接獲民眾投訴，男星黃立成創立的「M17」集團旗下同志交友平台「HEDER」，以低價拉攏條件良好的單身猛男，吸引其他同志朋友付下高額費用，期待能配對成功，但實際上這些人卻是為了充門面而已，讓你看的到卻吃不著。
據投訴的同志會員表示，他與朋友分別繳交了五萬新台幣的報名費用給交友平台進行5次配對，等於平均與一位對象配對約一次會要花掉一萬元。但雙方見面後卻發現，對方條件通常都很差，就算遇到條件稍微好一點的，通常都是約會過一次後就不了了之，讓他直呼不值得。這樣花錢找罪受就算了，近來該會員竟發現有位身材健美的猛男只花了一千塊就直接入會參與配對，更因外表、工作條件都相當好，吸引不少人急欲配對。這也讓他不禁懷疑該交友平台刻意找讓同志朋友容易產生幻想的猛男來吸人付錢入會，但實際上卻「看的到吃不著」。

該會員事後質問該交友平台服務人員，為何同樣繳錢入會配對，待遇竟相差如此大？對方卻僅答覆「如果對方在約會過程有違約行為，會將他停權處置」等不相干回應，刻意淡化不同條件的會員有不同的配對費用的態度，只能徒呼負負。對於遭受不平等對待，該會員備感無奈，也只能自認倒楣，他表示當初就是看中該平台是知名集團旗下產品，認為不會遭遇詐騙等情事，但事到如今，他未來也再不相信這樣的交友平台。

[Exclusive] Huang Licheng created a gay dating platform for differential treatment. Dating 1 time 10,000 people only used 1000 to eat full

Recently, the magazine received complaints from the public. The ""M17"" group of the ""M17"" group, created by the male star Huang Licheng, has drawn a good single man at a low price, attracting other comrades and friends to pay high fees, and expects to be successful. But in fact, these people are just to fill the facade, so you can't eat it.
According to the comrades who complained, he and his friends paid the registration fee of NT$50,000 to the dating platform for 5 times, which is equivalent to spending an average of 10,000 yuan on an average partner. However, after meeting the two sides, they found that the conditions of the other party are usually very poor. Even if the conditions are slightly better, it is usually not possible after the date has been met. It is not worthwhile to let him call. In this way, even if the member spends money to find guilty, recently, the member found that a man with a bodybuilding body spent only a thousand pieces to participate in the pairing directly, and because of his appearance and working conditions, he was attracted by many people. . This also made him wonder that the dating platform deliberately asked the comrades who made the comrades' friends easy to generate illusions to attract people to pay in, but actually ""cannot eat.""


""HEDER"" is the first entity in Asia to set up an dating dating platform for comrades. (Figure / flip from HEDER official website)

Afterwards, the member questioned the service platform staff of the dating platform. Why did the same payment and membership match, and the treatment was so different? The other party only replied that ""if the other party has breached the contract during the dating process, he will stop the power to dispose of it"" and other irrelevant responses, and the members who deliberately dilute the different conditions have different matching costs, and can only be negative. For the unequal treatment, the member feels helpless and can only admit himself. He said that he was fancy that the platform is a product of a well-known group and that he would not encounter fraud and other circumstances, but now he will not believe it in the future. Such a dating platform.
