      <p>Evan Holyfield got his professional career off to a winning start in just 16 seconds in front of his proud father in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Five-time world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was watching on from ringside as his middle son made a major statement on the undercard of Canelo Alvarez vs Sergey Kovalev.</p>
      <p>He has been keen to take a back seat in the career of his son, but he could not help an approving nod as he watched a display which did the family name proud.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old came storming out of the blocks, launching a barrage of punches against opponent Nick Winstead and flooring him after just 16 seconds.</p>

      <p>He first stunned Winstead with a quick left hook, before connecting again with an overhand right which sent his opponent onto his heels then putting him down with another left hand.</p>
      <p>The fight was instantly waved off amongst protests from Winstead, with Holyfield celebrating a dream start to what he hopes will be a career to match his iconic father.</p>
