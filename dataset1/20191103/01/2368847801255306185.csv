組圖：港警暴力干預選舉 抓3候選人及200多人

03 Nov 2019, 01:46

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】11月2日下午3點，香港民眾在維園舉行「112求援國際，堅守自治」集會，向國際發出求援訊息。同時，全球17國家46個城市將同步舉行集會聲援香港。130多名民主派區議會選舉候選人在維園舉行選民聚會，但集會剛剛開始，就遭到大批防暴警察暴力干預。警方發射催淚彈，濫捕濫抓。
民間記者會週六發聲明譴責警方，指責「黨衛軍」假借「執法」之名，配合中共港共政權打壓民主派候選人，以武力明目張膽地干擾選舉。民間記者會呼籲國際社會關注並援助香港人道危機，並希望美國國會盡快通過《香港民主與人權法案》，制裁在港殘害人民的中共代理人。
當天有多個合法集會都被警方腰斬。警方在多地狂射催淚彈、胡椒球彈清場，並狂抓市民。次日，警方宣稱抓捕超過二百人，創下一日內抓人最高記錄。

Photo: Hong Kong police violent intervention elections 3 candidates and more than 200 people

03 Nov 2019, 01:46

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] At 3 pm on November 2, the Hong Kong people held a ""112 for International Assistance, Adhere to Autonomy"" rally in Victoria Park to send a message of help to the international community. At the same time, 46 cities in 17 countries around the world will hold a rally to support Hong Kong. More than 130 candidates for democratic regional council elections held a voter's party in Victoria Park. However, just after the rally began, they were violently intervened by a large number of riot police. The police fired tear gas and caught the catch.
The folk press conference issued a statement on Saturday condemning the police, accusing the ""Defence Army"" of using the name of ""enforcement"" and cooperating with the Chinese Communist regime to suppress democrats and use force to blatantly interfere with the election. The folk journalists will appeal to the international community to pay attention to and assist the humanitarian crisis in Hong Kong, and hope that the US Congress will pass the Hong Kong Democracy and Human Rights Act as soon as possible and sanction the CCP agents who have murdered the people in Hong Kong.
There were a number of legal gatherings on the day that were shackled by the police. The police fired tear gas and pepper balls in many places to clear the field and madly caught the public. The next day, the police claimed to arrest more than 200 people, setting a record for catching people in one day.
