A Chinese hospital has suspended 11 staff members for trying to sell medical waste used by a famous singer.
Singaporean songwriter JJ Lin, who is hugely popular in China, stayed at a hospital in the Jiangsu province of east China as he was treated for a fever last Saturday.
Soon after his medical treatment, pictures emerged on Chinese social media of an IV drip bag, syringe and a paper cup and were widely shared.
The post suggested web users could bid for the items that were reportedly used by the famous singer during his hospital stay.

A video shared online shows the nurses taking turns to lie on the ward bed where Mr Lin had been treated.
Mao Zhenwei, chief executive at Zhenjiang No.1 People's Hospital, said in a press conference that the picture was first shared among a closed chat group on WeChat.

Mao expressed his deep sincere apology and stated the medical waste had been disposed of in accordance with regulations.
