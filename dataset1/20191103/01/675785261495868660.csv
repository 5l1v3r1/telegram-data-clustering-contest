Evan Holyfield got his professional career off to a winning start in just 16 seconds in front of his proud father in Las Vegas.
Five-time world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield was watching on from ringside as his middle son made a major statement on the undercard of Canelo Alvarez vs Sergey Kovalev.
He has been keen to take a back seat in the career of his son, but he could not help an approving nod as he watched a display which did the family name proud.
The 21-year-old came storming out of the blocks, launching a barrage of punches against opponent Nick Winstead and flooring him after just 16 seconds.

He first stunned Winstead with a quick left hook, before connecting again with an overhand right which sent his opponent onto his heels then putting him down with another left hand.
The fight was instantly waved off amongst protests from Winstead, with Holyfield celebrating a dream start to what he hopes will be a career to match his iconic father.
