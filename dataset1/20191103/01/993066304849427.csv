BACK IN THE DAY
The Irish News, November 5 2009: Ryan Cup Division 1D: Queen's 0-11 UUJ 0-11
Late Kielt point earns a draw for Queen's
When the ball floated gently over the crossbar, Jordanstown manager Adrian McGuckin smiled, turned, and said: “Unreal”.
It was an apt description for the conversion he had just witnessed.
At least 50 metres from goal, not far from the sideline, and facing a swirling breeze, Darren Hughes had just split the posts with an audacious effort taken from the ground.
A couple of minutes earlier, Hughes had been on target from 45 metres, that free was also kicked in the traditional style. The athletic Monaghan man has sweet memories of the Dub.
Last year, he gave the performance of his career when he captained Jordanstown toashock victory against Queen's in the Sigerson Cup.
Hughes was back in fine form yesterday, but he had to share top billing with his midfield opponent, Charlie Kielt.
Indeed, the influence of this duo was such, that the game could be more accurately described as Charlie Kielt v Darren Hughes rather than Queen'svJordanstown.
