      <h1>Meghan Markle 'wasn't begged for a date by Ashley Cole,' says his brother</h1>
      <h2>Ashley Cole's brother, Matty Cole, said reports his brother had begged the former Suits star for a date are 'nonsense'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T01:10:03+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>Ashley Cole's brother has said reports the ex-footballer begged Meghan Markle for a date are "nonsense".</p>
      <p>The former Suits star reportedly revealed she was being pursued by Cheryl Tweedy's ex in an interview with a UK based journalist nearly six years ago.</p>
      <p>Lizzie Cundy has also claimed she tried to set Meghan up with Ashley after his split from Cheryl in 2010.</p>
      <p>She said the pair got on "like a house on fire" at a charity event and Meghan revealed she was looking for a British boyfriend.</p>
      <p>Lizzie explained: "She wanted to find a boyfriend. She said 'I would like a British boyfriend'."</p>

      <p>When Lizzie asked if she wanted a celebrity, Meghan replied: "Why not?"</p>
      <p>But Matty Cole told The Sun: “It’s nonsense, completely made up. He definitely wouldn’t have to beg <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> for a date.</p>
      <p>“She’s not the kind of girl he goes for anyway, and he’s never fancied her.”</p>
      <p>However, the showbiz journalist at the Mail Online claims Meghan showed her the messages Ashley had been sending her.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "[Meghan pulled an] iPhone from her handbag, she pointed to the picture of a good-looking man on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account, and said: 'Do you know this guy, Ashley Cole?</p>
      <p>"'I bet,' I said calmly.</p>
      <p>"She continued: 'He wants to go out on a date while I'm over here in London. What do you think? Do you know him?'"</p>
      <p>At the time Ashley was playing for Chelsea and earning around £100,000 a week.</p>

      <p>But in the UK he was known as pop princess Cheryl's ex, who had a roving eye reputation. Meghan, who knew nothing about his cheating past, was swiftly informed - and decided to swerve a date with the footie ace.</p>
      <p>She said: "Some of my friends told me to stay away from him, too. I think I'll leave it."</p>
      <p>Meghan, then 32, had just divorced film producer husband  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-meghan-markles-first-husband-11595699">Trevor Engelson</a> , and was meeting up with UK journalists in a bid to get a mention in press the other side of the pond.</p>
      <p>She went on to meet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> on a blind date and the couple wed in 2018.</p>
      <p>Their first child, Archie, was born in May.</p>
