Meghan Markle's alleged claim that Ashley Cole pursued her before she met husband Prince Harry is “nonsense,” the ex-soccer ace’s brother says.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, is said to have told a journalist that womanizer Cole, also 38, “tried very hard” to get her attention on Twitter back in 2013.
It is said to have been part of a “determined” drive by the then U.S. soap actress to boost her profile by appearing in U.K. tabloids.

But Matty Cole said: “It’s nonsense, completely made up. He definitely wouldn’t have to beg Meghan Markle for a date.
“She’s not the kind of girl he goes for anyway, and he’s never fancied her.”
Duchess Meghan last month claimed the British media was trying to “destroy” her.

But a showbiz editor revealed she “all but begged” for tabloid exposure two years before she met Harry.
Last month, TV presenter Lizzie Cundy — a former friend of the duchess — described her as “manipulating.”
Cundy said she had “seen a different side” to Duchess Meghan since she joined the Royal Family last year.
