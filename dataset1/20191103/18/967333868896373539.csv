Caracas Expels El Salvador Diplomats, Gives Them 48 Hours to Leave Venezuela

03 Nov 2019, 18:24


The day before, El Salvador gave Venezuela's diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, explaining the decision by the country's vote in the Organisation of American States (OAS), which supports a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights condemning alleged violations of the human rights of Venezuelans.

Venezuela expelled on Saturday diplomats of El Salvador, giving the officials 48 hours to leave the country.
The decision comes a day after El Salvador initiated the cut of diplomatic ties by expelling Venezuelan diplomats of the country. 



El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele assumed office on 1 June, and since the beginning, he has distanced himself from Venezuela and proclaimed the United States to be his country's greatest historical ally.



​Nayib Bukele recognised the head of the country’s legislature Juan Guaido as ""president in charge of Venezuela"" and advocated ""in the near future, the receipt of credentials from the new diplomatic representation of Venezuela.""
Venezuela has been suffering from a severe political crisis since late January when US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president in a bid to oust Venezuelan President Maduro from power.
Maduro has accused Guaido of being a US puppet, working with Washington to orchestrate a coup so that the US can control Venezuela’s vast fossil fuel reserves, the largest in the world.
