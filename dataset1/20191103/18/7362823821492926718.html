      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a>'s alleged claim that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Ashley Cole</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-meghan-markle-tv-host-famous-english-men">pursued her</a> before she met husband <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> is “nonsense,” the ex-<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer">soccer </a>ace’s brother says.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10256437/meghan-markle-wounded-creature-need-healed-intimate-chat-2/">The Duchess of Sussex, 38,</a> is said to have told a journalist that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10206995/ashley-cole-manager-chance-lampard-jt-gerrard/">womanizer Cole, </a>also 38, “tried very hard” to get her attention on Twitter back in 2013.</p>
      <p>It is said to have been part of a “determined” drive by the then U.S. soap actress to boost her profile by appearing in U.K. tabloids.</p>

      <p>But Matty Cole said: “It’s nonsense, completely made up. He definitely wouldn’t have to beg Meghan Markle for a date.</p>
      <p>“She’s not the kind of girl he goes for anyway, and he’s never fancied her.”</p>
      <p>Duchess Meghan last month claimed the British media was trying to “destroy” her.</p>

      <p>But a showbiz editor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-tabloids-prince-harry-ashley-cole">revealed she “all but begged” for tabloid exposure</a> two years before she met Harry.</p>
      <p>Last month, TV presenter Lizzie Cundy — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-meghan-markle-tv-host-famous-english-men">a former friend of the duchess</a> — described her as “manipulating.”</p>
      <p>Cundy said she had “seen a different side” to Duchess Meghan since she joined the Royal Family last year.</p>
