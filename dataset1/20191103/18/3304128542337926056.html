      <p>The baby, who was born on October 2, joins the list of Diamond’s babies who have Instagram accounts. Tiffa and her brother Nillan’s accounts are run by Diamond’s ex-lover Zari Hassan.</p>
      <p>Tanasha had declined to reveal the baby’s name for fear of ‘wicked people harming him’.</p>
      <p>There have been rumours that the couple falsified the birth of their son to coincide with the <i>Bongo</i> star’s 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>Tanasha, however, denied the claims saying that would only make her a bad mother.</p>

      <p>“I know people do a lot for clout. But fake my son’s birthday for 15 minutes of clout? Only an idiot can do that. What kind of mother would I be to have my son celebrate a false birthday each year?</p>
      <p>I’d be a very selfish mother to do that. Foolish blogs, they never get their facts right!” she lamented.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to prove that the couple didn’t lie about the child’s birth, Tanasha took to Instagram to post a photo of her at hospital with a band on her hand bearing the date of delivery, “Tanasha Donna Baby, DOB: 02-OCT-2019.”</p>
      <p>“17 Hours Of Labour at 42 weeks, natural birth… But it was worth it. Good is good am now a mom to a healthy beautiful baby boy who shares a birthday with my love. Thank you, Lord, ” she wrote.</p>
