      <p>BEIRUT: Tens of thousands of Lebanese packed into central Beirut Sunday calling on officials to speed up the political transition following Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s resignation last week.This was the biggest anti-government demonstration since supporters of the militant Hezbollah group rampaged through their main protest site in the lead up to Hariri stepping down. The demonstration on Sunday came hours after a much smaller rally of thousands was held in support of Lebanon’s president and foreign minister, two of the main targets of the anti-government protests, which first erupted Oct. 17. The protesters called for a general strike Monday, but flyers circulating online later rescinded the call. The protesters are calling for sweeping changes to the political system established after the 1975-1990 civil war. President Michel Aoun, his son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, and other political leaders have refused the protesters’ demands to resign. Aoun and Bassil are members of a Christian party allied with the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has accused foreign powers of manipulating the protests.--- With AP Related Articles <a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1061517-fighting-the-tragedy-of-the-commons">Fighting the tragedy of the commons </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1061754-protesters-close-roads-paralyzing-lebanon-as-crisis-worsens"> Protesters close roads, paralyzing Lebanon as crisis worsens </a><a href="https://en.annahar.com/article/1061655-protesters-call-for-a-general-strike-on-monday"> Protesters call for general strike on Monday</a></p>
