      <p><b>OTTAWA, OntarioÂ (AP)</b> - The Ottawa Senators say forward Scott Sabourin has a fractured nose and is expected to be released from the hospital later Sunday, a day after being taken off the ice on a stretcher during a game in Boston.</p>
      <p>Sabourin was taken from the ice with his head immobilized following a collision with David Backes in which the players' helmets hit at nearly full speed early in the first period of Boston's 5-2 win on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Sabourin gave the crowd a "thumbs up" as he was taken from the arena.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old Sabourin posted a photo to his Instagram on Sunday morning of him in a hospital bed while smiling with a chipped tooth, a black eye and a few cuts around his face.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for all the well wishes. Hope to be back out on the ice in the near future," Sabourin wrote with the post.</p>
      <p>After colliding with Backes, Sabourin fell to the ice and appeared to be unconscious. There was a large blood spot on the ice under his face.</p>
      <p>Backes went to the dressing after Sabourin was taken from the ice and didn't return. The Bruins announced that Backes had an upper-body injury. He was visibly upset, fighting back tears, as medical personnel attended to Sabourin.</p>
      <p>Sabourin has played in 11 NHL games, all this season, with one goal and one assist.</p>
