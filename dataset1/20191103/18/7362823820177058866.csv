A homeowner in Colorado shot a man who was allegedly trying to break into his home early Saturday after warning multiple times he had a weapon, according to officials and family members.
The Denver Police Department said on Twitter the incident happened around 12:44 a.m. on the 4600-block of Wyandot Street in the city's Sunnyside neighborhood.
The suspect, identified as 25-year-old Aaron Rivers, was attempting to break into the home through the front door.

Family members told FOX31 the homeowner told the suspect to leave several times, warning he had a gun, but the 25-year-old proceeded to break the window and was later shot.
“I just feel sorry for my neighbors over there, they are a nice couple and they have a little boy,” Kathy Parsons, a neighbor across the street, told the television station. “The guy started to try to beat down the front door and he was afraid he had a gun ready for him to come through.”
