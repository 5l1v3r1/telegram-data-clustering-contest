The 32-year-old is one of a number of South American footballers to be hit with an international ban, which includes former Paraguay 'keeper Roberto Rojas who intentionally cut himself in order to deceive the match officials and earned a lifetime ban for his troubles. 
Uruguay star Luis Suarez was suspended for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus was banned for two months after his furious reaction to being sent off at the Copa America earlier in the year.

The French had further trouble at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa where a number of players revolted against coach Raymond Domenech, resulting in the likes of Nicolas Anelka, Patrice Evra and Franck Ribery being expelled from the team.
