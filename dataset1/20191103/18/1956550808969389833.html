      <p>There is set to be a dry night in Dubai, and itâ€™s due to fall on Friday November 8.</p>
      <p>Dubai will be dry for the night from 5.30pm on Friday November 8 until 6.30pm on Saturday November 9.</p>
      <p>This means that bars and restaurants across Dubai will not be serving anything other than soft drinks. There will also be no entertainment.</p>
      <p>Other upcoming celebrations mean that public and private sector workers could enjoy a <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/421372-a-three-day-public-holiday-for-the-uae-will-take-place-in-december">public holiday</a> on Sunday December 1 for Commemoration Day and two days' holiday for UAE National Day on December 2 and 3.</p>
      <p>So if you already get weekends off, it looks like you might be able to expect five days off at the end of November and beginning of December.</p>

      <p>Dry night Fri Nov 8, 5.30pm-Sat Nov 9, 6.30pm.</p>
