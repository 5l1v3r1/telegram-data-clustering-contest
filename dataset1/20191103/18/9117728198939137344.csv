McLaren duo wary of wind at United States Grand Prix
03 Nov 2019, 18:21 by Adam Newton

The McLaren pairing of Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris are starting seventh and eighth for Sunday's United States Grand Prix, but they will be wary of a change in direction of wind from Saturday's qualifying session.

It was originally thought that McLaren may struggle at the Circuit of the Americas, but the duo locked out row four with an impressive qualifying performance.
However, the wind of all things could make it tough for them at lights out.



Sainz said after qualifying: ""With this wind direction from the north, the car switches on – for reasons we still don’t understand.

""The wind is going to change back to FP2 so it would have a big effect on us, so heads down, analyse and make sure it doesn’t happen like in Mexico.""

Teammate Norris added: ""The wind favoured us a bit more today which is good and bad at the same time. Good because we took advantage of it and we have a strong position for tomorrow.""
