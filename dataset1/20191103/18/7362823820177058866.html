      <p>Family members told FOX31 the homeowner told the suspect to leave several times, warning he had a gun, but the 25-year-old proceeded to break the window and was later shot.</p>
      <p>“I just feel sorry for my neighbors over there, they are a nice couple and they have a little boy,” Kathy Parsons, a neighbor across the street, told the television station. “The guy started to try to beat down the front door and he was afraid he had a gun ready for him to come through.”</p>
