      <p>Cape Town - <b>Mamelodi Sundowns</b> had to come back from a goal down on two separate occasions before they eventually managed to squeeze past <b>Chippa United</b> in the quarter-final of the <b>Telkom Knockout </b>in Port Elizabeth on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The home side could not have asked for a better start than when they grabbed the lead in just the 13th minute of the match.</p>
      <p>After a couple of speculative long-range attempts, Tercious Malepe split the Downs defence in half with a glorious ball to Augustine Kwem, who finished calmly passed Denis Onyango.</p>
      <p>They continued to dominate and should have been 2-0 up moments later but Elvis Moyo blew the golden opportunity to put a real stamp on the match.</p>
      <p>The visitors grew in confidence after that miss and could have been back on level terms shortly before half time when Mauricio Affonso managed to get his head to a cross before the on-rushing Patrick Tignyemb, but the Uruguayan disappointingly couldn't hit the target.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians grabbed the equaliser five minutes after the break, though, as Phakamani Mahlambi made an instant impact off the bench by winning a penalty moments after he had been sent on by Pitso Mosimane. The spot kick was finished emphatically by Gaston Sirino.</p>
      <p>Chippa regained the lead thanks to huge stroke of luck eight minutes later. Silas Maziya attempted to hit an audacious cross on the volley and his miss-timed looped over Onyango and into the goal.</p>
      <p>The visitors reacted to going down again in a very similar fashion, by slowly working themselves back into the game by wearing their hosts down.</p>
      <p>It paid dividends in the 70th minute when Tignyemb couldn't hang on to a Thapelo Morena cross and Sirino was on hand to tap in a simple goal for his brace.</p>
      <p>Both sides threw caution to the wind in search of an equalising goal, but the attempts grew more speculative and less threatening as the players became increasingly tired.</p>
      <p>Any hope Chippa had of grabbing a winning goal before heading to penalties vanished in the 101st minute when Tercious Malepe was shown a red card.</p>
      <p>In opposition to how the match began for the home side, they could not have had a worse start to the penalty shoot out as Onyango saved their very first attempt.</p>
      <p>Every single Sundowns player scored with their penalties while Lehlogonolo Masalesa missed the final kick of the match to ensure the Brazilians would advance to the semi-final.</p>
