        <b>Shakib Al Hasan, who was banned from cricket for breaching graft code last week, has met Anti-Corruption Commission Chairman Iqbal Mahmood at its Dhaka headquarters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Test and Twenty20 International captain of the national team has been the ACC’s goodwill ambassador since 2018.<br/><br/>He did not speak to the press.<br/><br/>“He came to discuss an issue. It was a scheduled meeting,” ACC spokesman Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya said.<br/><br/>ACC officials said they treated Shakib to traditional winter cakes. <br/><br/>He will not be able to play until Oct 29 next year due to the ban slapped by the International Cricket Council for not reporting “corrupt approaches” by a bookie. He also faces another year of suspended ban.<br/><br/>ACC chief Iqbal had earlier hailed Shakib for accepting the charges brought by the ICC.<br/><br/>He hoped Shakib would be with the ACC in its efforts to prevent corruption.</p>
