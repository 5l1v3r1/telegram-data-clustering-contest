President Michel Aoun, his son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, and other political leaders have refused the protesters’ demands to resign. Aoun and Bassil are members of a Christian party allied with the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has accused foreign powers of manipulating the protests.--- With AP Related Articles Fighting the tragedy of the commons  Protesters close roads, paralyzing Lebanon as crisis worsens  Protesters call for general strike on Monday
