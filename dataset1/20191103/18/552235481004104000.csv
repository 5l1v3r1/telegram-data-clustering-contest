Rangers captain James Tavernier hailed the contribution of Alfredo Morelos after reaching the Betfred Cup Final - but forgot about his second goal.
Filip Helander opened the scoring for Steven Gerrard's side just before the break against Hearts, with the Colombian striker hitting a double to set up a final against Celtic .
Speaking after the match Tavernier was full of praise for Morelos, but the fact his team-mate had scored twice seemed to slip his mind.
The captain told Rangers TV: ""You go into the second half leading and it's a matter of controlling the game and breaking them down.
""We know we're going to create opportunities and we did second half.
""Alfredo and... Fil? No, he was first half... Oh yeah, he (Morelos) got two. Alfredo got two second half!
""He came up with the goods and put us over the line.
""He's been terrific for us from the start of the season.
""He's really put his head down and he's been terrific. He had some problems last season with his discipline but he's shown already how he's matured and he's a real big asset for us.""
