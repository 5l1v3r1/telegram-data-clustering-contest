      <h1>Smog crisis as 'hazardous' air levels in major city close schools and halt flights</h1>
      <h2>India's capital city Delhi shrouded in toxic smog as government takes drastic steps to protect people and get the city running again</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T18:13:29+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Nadeem Badshah</a></address>
      <p>Air quality in Delhi reached “hazardous” levels as a minister admitted the situation was “unbearable”.</p>
      <p>The smog crisis in the Indian capital has led to schools having to be closed, flights being diverted and building work being forced to stop.</p>
      <p>Levels of lethal PM2.5 particles in the air are far higher than recommended, and around seven times higher than China’s capital Beijing.</p>
      <p>Five million masks were handed out to school children as officials declared a public health emergency.</p>
      <p>Delhi's Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, 51, compared the city to a “gas chamber”, blaming field stubble burning by farmers.</p>

      <p>He said: “Pollution has reached unbearable levels...”</p>
      <p>The city's schools have been closed until at least Tuesday, all construction halted for a week and fireworks have been banned.</p>
      <p>And from Monday, the city will launch a temporary scheme so only cars with odd or even numbered licence plates can drive on given days, in a bid to slash traffic pollution.</p>
      <p>The thick blanket has led to polluted waters in the river Yamuna which is used for rituals by Hindus.</p>
      <p>The high pollution levels has been partly caused by farmers in neighbouring states burning crop stubble to clear their fields, creating a lethal cocktail of carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.</p>

      <p>Fireworks set off during the Hindu festival Diwali as well as vehicle fumes and construction and industrial emissions have also been blamed.</p>
      <p>Mr Kejriwal tweeted: "Pollution has reached unbearable levels across North India.</p>
      <p>“Delhi government taken many steps. Delhiites have made many sacrifices.</p>
      <p>“Delhi suffering for no fault of theirs.</p>
      <p>“Centre should take immediate steps to provide relief. We will support Centre in all initiatives".</p>
      <p>In a video posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , he added: “"In the last 20 days so much smog has come to Delhi but the media is saying 'don't do blame game'.</p>

      <p>“We don't want to do that. It is about our health... our kids... our future. What would we get if we played blame game?"</p>
      <p>He added: ”We are just saying... what is the disease? The disease is that air polluted by crop burning comes into Delhi and we have to stop it."</p>
      <p>Last month, Mr Kejriwal announced plans to sweep roads mechanically, plant trees and control pollution at 12 hotspots in the city.</p>
      <p>India is home to many of the world's most polluted cities.</p>
