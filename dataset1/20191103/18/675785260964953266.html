      <h1>Cruel elephant camp where babies bred to perform are hit with hammers and tugged by ears</h1>
      <h2>WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT. Footage from inside a baby elephant nursery in Thailand reveals the young calves are struck, scraped by metal bullhooks and forced to learn cruel tricks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T18:54:42+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Peacock</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of elephants are being abused and kept in captivity in a camp in northern Thailand, where they are bred for the purpose of becoming money-making 'performers'.</p>
      <p>The calves are taken away from their mothers when they are just two years old before being forced to learn tricks and perform at Maesa Elephant Nursery.</p>
      <p>Footage taken inside the nursery by Moving Animals - a photojournalism and filming project working to expose animal industries around the world - shows the young elephants being struck and scraped by sharp metal bullhooks, tugged by their ears and chained up, swaying in distress.</p>
      <p>This kind of abuse is part of the 'phajaan' - the traditional process of breaking a young elephant's spirit.</p>

      <p>Elephants are bound with ropes, confined in tight wooden structures, starved and beaten repeatedly with bullhooks, nails and hammers until their will is crushed.</p>
      <p>Activist Amy Jones said the group's investigations across Asia had repeatedly shown elephants facing "relentless" physical and emotional suffering.</p>
      <p>"It is heartbreaking to think that these innocent babies at Maesa Elephant Nursery are at the start of a lifetime of captivity that will feature sharp bullhooks, cruel performances, and severe psychological stress," she said.</p>
      <p>“Travel companies are misleading tourists into supporting animal abuse.</p>
      <p>"To save another generation of baby elephants from a lifetime of misery, Defra must act now and ban British companies from selling tickets to elephant “attractions”."</p>

      <p>More than 80 elephants are living in captivity in the camp, which has been running for more than 40 years.</p>
      <p>The aim is that they will entertain tourists who come to see the infant elephants at the 'nursery' and watch the older animals perform.</p>
      <p>They're taught to paint pictures with their trunks, to throw sharp darts at balloon targets and to kick footballs into goals.</p>
      <p>They're also forced to pull and stack heavy logs.</p>
      <p>Over 20 animals take part in the performances, which are put on three times a day.</p>

      <p>The camp is one of many in which the baby animals are treated poorly.</p>
      <p>This year Phuket Zoo's performing baby elephant 'Dumbo' made headlines when he was forced to perform until his back legs snapped beneath him and he died.</p>
      <p>There were also concerns about the breeding systems in place in many elephant nurseries.</p>
      <p>One adult elephant at the camp had already given birth to six babies.</p>
      <p>As elephants spend 18-22 months in pregnancy, the mother elephants often spend a lot of their lives pregnant.</p>
      <p>They are often forced to continue to work and perform whilst pregnant.</p>
      <p>Moving Animals along with Save the Asian Elephants - a not-for-profit association - are urging Defra to implement a law making it illegal for British companies to advertise or profit from selling tickets to place like Maesa.</p>
      <p>The latter is asking individuals to voice their support, by signing a petition <a href="https://www.movinganimals.org/elephantnursery">here</a> .</p>
