      <h1>If an official is attacked we will withdraw our services, Lesufi warns Gauteng parents</h1>

      <p>MEC of Education in Gauteng Panyaza Lesufi has warned frustrated parents that should a district official be attacked during online placement, the service will be withdrawn.</p>
      <p>"Assaulting our officials who are trying to assist, with placements can’t be tolerated. We’ve persuaded union members not to pull out their members from our district offices however if a single official is attacked we will withdraw the service," he tweeted on Sunday.</p>

      <p>This comes after district officials allegedly faced intimidation from parents that had stood in line for hours to place their children only to find that the system is offline.</p>
      <p>The service was made available to parents to deal with the backlog in the placement of children.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-11-03-officials-attacked-as-irate-parents-queue-for-places-at-gauteng-schools/">TimesLive</a> the placement period for admissions of children in grades 1 and 8 at state schools in the province was scheduled to close on October 31 but a day before the deadline there were  about 77,000 parents who had neither declined nor accepted placement offers for their children.</p>
      <p>Lesufi further alerted parents to the fact that "most of [Gauteng's] good public schools" were full, but alternatives would be found to ensure that all learners are placed.</p>
      <p>A parent took to social media to plead with the MEC to intervene as parents had been in the queue for placements for up to three hours.</p>
      <p>"After queuing for 3hrs ,le system is offline.What for next my Daughter?We need assistance MEC (sic)," the frustrated parent asked.</p>

      <p>Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona has been approached for comment. This will be added once received.</p>
      <p>It was not clear at this stage whether the issues surrounding the offline system have been resolved.</p>
