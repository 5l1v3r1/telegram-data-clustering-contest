Police are investigating after a 97-year-old woman was found dead in her Fife home.
Detectives have refused to rule out foul play as they continue with forensic examinations at her house in the village of Kinglassie.
The pensioner, who lived alone, was discovered after a relative raised concerns with Police Scotland when the woman failed to make any contact for several days.
Officers forced their way into the house on the edge of the village on Friday, October 25, and found her body.
It's understood an initial post mortem has already been carried out and police are carrying out further examinations.
 
The case has not yet been passed to the Major Investigation Team, which probes murders and other suspicious deaths.
Police officers have remained stationed outside the bungalow since the grim find.
Neighbours have also been spoken to as part of the investigation.
A police spokeswoman said: ""Following a report of concern for a person, we attended an address on West End, Kinglassie, around 11.10am on Friday, 25th October.
""A 97-year-old woman was found dead within the property and her death is currently being treated as unexplained pending further enquiries.""
