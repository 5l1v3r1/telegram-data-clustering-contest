      <p>Announcement on loudspeakers at the Bentegodi stadium then warned fans the game would be abandoned under the league's anti-racism rules if the abuse continued.</p>
      <p>Later, Balotelli, who was born in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/italy.html">Italy</a> to Ghanian parents, scored a late consolation goal in his side's 2-1 loss.</p>
      <p>Verona coach Ivan Juric said that nothing special happened against Balotelli, save some hissing and teasing chants with no racial connotation. </p>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/fifa.html">FIFA</a> President Gianni Infantino urged Italian <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/football.html">football</a> authorities to hand out stadium bans for supporters guilty of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/racism.html">racism</a> after an incident in a Serie A match between Atalanta and Fiorentina.</p>
      <h3>'Why always me?'</h3>
      <p>The 29-year-old Balotelli experienced racism at the beginning of his career in Italy, when he rose to prominence with Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Balotelli's on-the-field achievements have often been overshadowed by his antics on and off the field.</p>
      <p>During his time at Manchester City, where he won the league title, Balotelli was sent off four times, threw a dart at a youth-team player and was involved in an incident that saw fireworks explode in his toilet.</p>
      <p>After scoring against Manchester United, he revealed a T-shirt under his City jersey reading, "Why Always Me?"</p>
