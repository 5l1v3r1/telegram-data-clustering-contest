      </p>
      <p>Messi was slapped with a three-month ban after the FC Barcelona star labelled FIFA as “corrupt” following his controversial sending off during Argentina’s third-place play-off win over Chile at the 2019 Copa America in July.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old is one of a number of South American footballers to be hit with an international ban, which includes former Paraguay 'keeper Roberto Rojas who intentionally cut himself in order to deceive the match officials and earned a lifetime ban for his troubles. </p>
      <p>Uruguay star Luis Suarez was suspended for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus was banned for two months after his furious reaction to being sent off at the Copa America earlier in the year.</p>

      <p>In Europe, Zinedine Zidane received a three-match ban for his infamous headbutt on Italy's Marco Materazzi at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, although he retired from international football before serving his time. </p>
      <p>The French had further trouble at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa where a number of players revolted against coach Raymond Domenech, resulting in the likes of Nicolas Anelka, Patrice Evra and Franck Ribery being expelled from the team. </p>

      <p>Former Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng received an indefinite ban from the Black Stars camp four years later for "persistent disciplinary issues", while Egypt’s Amr Warda was also temporarily suspended by the national team after allegations of sexual harassment emerged against him.</p>
