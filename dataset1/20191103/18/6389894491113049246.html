      <h1>Christmas can come too early - or at least the adverts can</h1>

      <p>It’s just days since Halloween, but the Christmas advert season is well and truly upon us already.</p>
      <p>But not everyone is feeling festive yet. Market researcher Kantar Group has revealed that 67 per cent of shoppers think the adverts are too early. </p>

      <p>On the other hand, 46 per cent love the festive adverts and can’t wait to see them on television.</p>
      <p>Lynne Deason, head of creative excellence at Kantar, says that retailers had changed their strategies for their adverts this year:</p>
      <p>“Overall there seems to be little in the way of brands focusing on product messaging, or even a higher purpose.”</p>
      <p>Instead, the focus is much more on recreating the magic of the cinematic experience.</p>
      <p>Asda’s advert, for example, tells the story of a young girl who uses her imagination to make other people’s wishes come true by capturing the magic of the Northern Lights.</p>
      <p>Argos’ effort harks back to the days before ecommerce, reimagining the perennial classic catalogue as a “Book of Dreams”.</p>
      <p>Deason says: It’s single minded, simple and assuming the supporting paid and earned channels deliver core brand messages as intended, then this should be a strong campaign for the brand.”</p>
      <p>Iceland, on the other hand, has gone back to basics by focusing on its partnership with Disney for Frozen 2. </p>
      <p>It’s an odd move, Deason said, for a company who want to be seen as so much more than a frozen food retailer. </p>
      <p>“Reinforcing long held perceptions around their frozen heritage in such an obvious way, may seem like a slightly backwards step.”</p>

      <p>For Deason, all this Christmas cheer could be just what we need:</p>
      <p>“Many of the brands are making a very deliberate effort to lift spirits and distract from the doom and gloom around! This is much needed with us hurtling towards a Christmas election and the prospect of a unending discussion on Brexit.”</p>
