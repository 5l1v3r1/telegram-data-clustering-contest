Superintendent Jim Causby called the incident ""unfortunate,"" and said he wishes it hadn't happened.
""It is never appropriate for a teacher to segregate students based on religious, political or personal beliefs,"" Causby said. ""In fact, it is not appropriate for a teacher to even ask a student what their beliefs are. Our school system takes very seriously the rights of students in these areas and students should never be instructed to not share classroom activities with their parents.""
