      <p>Earlier this year, Adrian Marcel shared his <i>98th</i> album, returning with 15 new tracks to deliver on an update since 2017's <i>GMFU</i> output.</p>
      <p>Since then, the crooner went on to flex his acting chops with a starring role in the television biopic <i>The Bobby DeBarge Story</i>, taking on the role of James DeBarge.</p>
      <p>Now, after supporting <i>98th</i> with a visual and launching the second semester of his "Marcel University" masterclass series, the crooner revisits 98th and brings in a little help from his pal <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/CaseyVeggies/profile">Casey Veggies</a> for the assist on the remix for "Can't Go For That." On the cut, the two men set their respective boundaries in love and relationships.</p>

      </p>
      <p>I think I’m done<br/>Can’t do this forever<br/>I must be done<br/>If I stay it’s whatever<br/>I can take a lot of things baby<br/>But I can’t go for that</p>
