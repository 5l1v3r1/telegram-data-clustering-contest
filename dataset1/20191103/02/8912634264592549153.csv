Placement-wise of course I’m happy with the results,” Chan told isu.org.“I made a lot of silly errors, errors that I need to fix,” he added.Chen’s second gold medal of the series after winning at Skate America in Las Vegas hands the 20-year-old a chance to claim his third straight overall Grand Prix title.Later Saturday, 16-year-old Russian Alena Kostornaia carried her lead from the short program to the free skating with an overall score of 159.45 points to clinch her second senior medal in only three competitions.Kostornaia, who claimed gold at the Finlandia Trophy in mid-October, saw off Mariah Bell of the United States who was second on 142.64 and compatriot and Olympic champion Alina Zagitova in third with 141.82.“I am pleased that I was able to skate well and to show a clean program. I hope to improve my jumps and my program with each competition and to perfect myself.“I had a show number to this music and I liked it so much and we decided to use it for this season,” said Kostornaia who skated to ‘Twilight’, ‘New Moon’ and ‘Supermassive Black Hole’.Elsewhere, four-time world champion ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron clinched their fifth French Grand Prix win in the space of six years.The French pair scored an overall 133.55 points to beat the American pair of Madison Chock and Evan Bates with Italy’s Charlene Guignard and Marco Gabbri in third.Russia’s Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov took the pairs won ahead of compatriots Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin.Grenoble is the third stop on the six-round Grand Prix series.
