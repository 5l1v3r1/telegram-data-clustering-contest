MILWAUKEE, Nov 3 — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 36 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and added eight assists as the Milwaukee Bucks held on to defeat the visiting Toronto Raptors 115-105 last night.

Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Bucks, while Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each had 11 points.

The Bucks bumped the lead to seven points on Middleton’s two free thows with 3:27 remaining. VanVleet’s 3-pointer trimmed the lead to four with 2:24 remaining. But the Bucks went ahead by eight on a dunk by Antetokounmpo with 1:22 to go.
The Bucks opened a 12-1 lead with Antetokounmpo scoring seven and finished the first quarter with a 36-17 lead.
The lead reached 22 points early in the second quarter when Lopez made a 3-pointer. Middleton’s reverse layup with 4:59 remaining in the first half gave the Bucks a 55-30 lead.
