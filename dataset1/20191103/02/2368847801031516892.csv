午餐時間攻擊 馬利軍方前哨基地釀50死

03 Nov 2019, 02:55

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】馬利東北部一個軍方前哨基地1日遇襲，造成50人喪生，其中包括一名法軍士兵；另有3人受傷。激進組織伊斯蘭國（IS）聲稱犯下這起攻擊案。這是近期伊斯蘭武裝暴力針對馬利軍方發起的最嚴重攻擊之一；外界認為，近期幾起攻擊案對中西非國家反恐武力及法國來說，都是一種羞辱。
事發在馬利與尼日爾（Niger，另譯尼日）邊境的梅納卡（Menaka）地區因代利曼（Indelimane）前哨基地，當時正值午餐時間。
馬利通訊部長桑加雷（Yaya Sangare）在推特（Twitter）發文表示，「情況已在控制之中，搜索及辨識死者的程序持續進行。」
當局一度稱死亡人數達53人，翌日更正至50人死亡，另有3人受傷，軍車等物資被毀及被劫走。死者包括隸屬法軍瓦朗斯非正規騎兵第一兵團的士兵普安托（Ronan Pointeau）。
桑加雷表示，有10名倖存者在前哨基地被發現，前哨基地受損相當嚴重。當局表示，已派增援去保護這片區域及追捕發起攻擊的人。



一個月前，在靠近馬利與布吉納法索邊境處，發生兩起激進組織武裝攻擊案，造成40名軍人死亡。
伊斯蘭極端分子勢力從馬利北部延伸到中部，中部地區混居不同種族，是個不太穩定的地區，馬利軍方面對他們的造反陷入苦戰。
近期攻擊案對G5沙赫爾國家組織（G5 Sahel）和法國來說是一種羞辱。這個組織由馬利、查德、布吉納法索、茅利塔尼亞及尼日爾等5國聯合組成，有5000人的反恐武力；法國則承諾支援這個脆弱的區域。

Lunch time attack, Mali military outpost base brewed 50 dead

03 Nov 2019, 02:55

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] A military outpost in northeastern Mali was attacked on the 1st, killing 50 people, including a French soldier; and three others were injured. The radical organization Islamic State (IS) claims to have committed this attack. This is one of the most serious attacks launched by the Islamic armed violence against the Mali military. It is believed that the recent attacks are a humiliating act against the anti-terrorism force of the West and Central African countries and France.
The incident occurred at the Indelimane outpost in the Menaka area on the border with Mali and Niger, at lunch time.
Yari Sangare, Minister of Communications of Mali, said on Twitter that ""the situation is under control and the process of searching for and identifying the deceased continues.""
The authorities once said that the number of deaths reached 53. The next day, the number of deaths was reduced to 50, and three others were injured. Military vehicles and other materials were destroyed and stolen. The deceased included Ronan Pointeau, a soldier belonging to the First Corps of the French Cavalry irregular cavalry.
Sangare said that 10 survivors were found in the outpost and the outpost was seriously damaged. Authorities say they have sent reinforcements to protect the area and hunt down the people who launched the attack.



A month ago, two militant groups attacked militants near the border between Mali and Burkina Faso, killing 40 soldiers.
The extremist forces of Islam extended from the north of Mali to the central part. The central part of the country was mixed with different races. It was a less stable area, and the Ma Lijun was struggling against their rebellion.
The recent attack is a humiliation for the G5 Sahel and France. The organization is composed of five countries including Marley, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger, with 5,000 anti-terrorist forces; France is committed to supporting this fragile region.
