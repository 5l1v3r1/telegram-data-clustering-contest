Nestled along the shores of Lake Charles is a small little park boasting a few ferocious creatures.
When entering Lake Charles from Interstate-10 you’ll pass Cypress Pond, a small alligator enclosure containing several small alligators and a few turtles. There is no entrance fee and the exhibit is free for anyone who wants to get up close and personal with a few gators.
