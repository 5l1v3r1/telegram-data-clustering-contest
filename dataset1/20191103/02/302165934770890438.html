      <p>TOKOYO, Nov 3 — A film festival in suburban Tokyo will show a documentary on the highly controversial issue of Japan’s wartime military brothels, organisers said today after coming under fire for dropping the movie.</p>
      <p>The film’s screening was cancelled last week after concerns over the safety of volunteers and objections from local officials.</p>
      <p>But the decision was reversed after “lots of voices offering cooperation to address our safety concerns,” a member of the organising committee told AFP, who said the festival would increase the number of volunteers to boost security. </p>
      <p>The controversy over the film comes after an exhibit in central Japan was shut down for two months earlier this year after it received threats for displaying a statue of a wartime sex slave, and with relations between Japan and South Korea badly frayed over wartime issues. </p>
      <p>The documentary <i>Shusenjo: The Main Battleground of The Comfort Women Issue </i>examines the debate over so-called “comfort women”, who were forced to work in military brothels during World War II.</p>
      <p>Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women — mostly from Korea, but also other parts of Asia including China — were forced to work in the brothels.</p>
      <p>But some nationalists insist the women were prostitutes, claiming there is no documented evidence that the Japanese military was ordered to recruit women against their will.</p>
      <p>Some of the people interviewed in the film, by Japanese-American director Miki Dezaki, have filed suit against him, claiming they were not aware the interviews would be used in a movie for public release.</p>
      <p>Kawasaki City on Tokyo’s outskirts, which provided nearly half of the festival’s budget, reportedly expressed concerns about the lawsuit in its conversations with organisers.</p>
      <p>Local officials however denied pressuring organisers to drop the film, with one telling AFP they merely questioned “whether showing such a film is appropriate”. — AFP</p>
