      <p>MILWAUKEE, Nov 3 — Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 36 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and added eight assists as the Milwaukee Bucks held on to defeat the visiting Toronto Raptors 115-105 last night.</p>
      <p>The Raptors tried to come back from a 26-point deficit but could get no closer than four points in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>It was the first meeting between the teams since the Raptors eliminated the Bucks in the Eastern Conference finals last season.</p>
      <p>Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Bucks, while Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each had 11 points.</p>
      <p>Kyle Lowry led Toronto with a season-best 36 points and Pascal Siakam had 16 points before fouling out with 1:41 to play in the fourth quarter. Fred VanVleet added 12 points, Serge Ibaka scored 11 and Marc Gasol contributed 10 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Bucks scored the first five points in the fourth, but Ibaka’s dunk cut the lead to four with 7:03 remaining.</p>
      <p>The Bucks bumped the lead to seven points on Middleton’s two free thows with 3:27 remaining. VanVleet’s 3-pointer trimmed the lead to four with 2:24 remaining. But the Bucks went ahead by eight on a dunk by Antetokounmpo with 1:22 to go.</p>
      <p>The Bucks opened a 12-1 lead with Antetokounmpo scoring seven and finished the first quarter with a 36-17 lead.</p>
      <p>The lead reached 22 points early in the second quarter when Lopez made a 3-pointer. Middleton’s reverse layup with 4:59 remaining in the first half gave the Bucks a 55-30 lead.</p>
      <p>The Raptors outscored the Bucks 25-15 in the final 6:45 of the first half that ended with the Bucks leading 66-50.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo scored 17 first-half points and Lowry also led Toronto with 17. The Bucks shot 53.2 percent from the field and the Raptors shot 31.7 percent before the break.</p>
      <p>The Bucks opened a 20-point margin on a layup by Donte DiVincenzo two minutes into the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Lowry had 17 points in the third quarter as the Raptors trimmed the lead to 95-90 entering the fourth quarter. — Reuters</p>
