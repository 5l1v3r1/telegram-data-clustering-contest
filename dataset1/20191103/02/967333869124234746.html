      <p>The fluffy pooch is very focused on his goal, he keeps eating and eating the raindrops and the pupster even jumped in a bid to get them. However, it is more than likely that the baby boy was disappointed with the rain as he didn't taste what he expected to taste. Obviously, the puppy didn't think it was water, but rather treats for doggos.</p>
