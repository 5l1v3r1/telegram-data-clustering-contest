香港浮屍四大疑點 大陸特警揭中共絕密殺人內幕

03 Nov 2019, 02:22

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】香港「反送中」運動已延燒數月，近期香港跳樓自殺、浮屍等可疑案件暴增。對此，一名大陸特警披露，香港多起浮屍案是中共特戰隊所為，其中有4大重點。
香港反送中運動已持續5個多月以來，港警勾結中共臥底武警公安、及黑幫的血腥鎮壓示威者的消息不絕於耳。特別是自831港警恐襲港鐵太子站後，香港可疑「墜樓」、「浮屍」案件頻頻出現，而水警搶撈屍體等行動均引起外界質疑。
最典型的一個案例是，曾參與反送中並擅長跳水的15歲女學生陳彥霖，失蹤多日後全裸浮屍海面。警方指其自殺「無可疑」。但陳彥霖生前深諳水性，死時卻屍體赤裸，警方證詞與反常積極的捕撈動作，讓人疑竇。

11月2日，《大紀元》引述消息披露，香港多起浮屍案並非當地警察所為，而是中共軍方的黑手。
這名爆料人自稱，曾在中共公安特警隊任職。關於香港多起浮屍案，他查閱了大量照片進行比對，他肯定這是中共陸軍特戰隊、武警特戰隊的作戰手法。
爆料人稱，幾年前他作為中共公安特警通過了公安部的層層選拔，代表中共警察與香港飛虎隊（SDU) 交流學習。香港飛虎隊是港警最高作戰部隊，其戰術動作、格鬥技術非常全面。而香港所有警察裡面不存在任何一支隊伍比飛虎隊技能更多。
飛虎隊講究兩種作戰方式，第一種是控制嫌疑人，用土話說就是活捉；第二種是格殺嫌疑人，也就是一擊斃命。也就是說，香港的飛虎隊不存在有第三種作戰方式，而他們的訓練也就圍繞這兩種設計戰術動作。
這名爆料人說，如今發現的香港浮屍有4個重點：1，香港水中發現的屍體舌頭沒有伸出嘴外的， 這樣排除了勒死之嫌。2，屍體的手、腳均未呈現勾回狀，這樣排除了溺水而死進行投屍。3，根據報導屍體沒有內臟嚴重受損，骨骼沒有明顯變形，這樣排除了飛虎隊慣用的一擊斃命。4，屍體沒有針孔、彈孔、電擊傷，這樣排除了武器斃命。
綜上所述，所有死者根本不存在是被香港警察打死的！因為連飛虎隊都做不到的技戰術，其他香港警察更做不到！
這名爆料人肯定的說：死者基本上都是在假死狀態下被投入水中，也就是說他們被投入水中之前還有生命跡象，在死亡邊緣。這種技術全世界只有中共陸軍特戰隊、武警特戰隊、公安特警精英才具備。
之所以這麼說，原因是世界任何國家暴力機關的訓練只有控制和擊殺，只有中共還有一種訓練就是讓對方半死不活。
他感嘆這太恐怖了，真沒想到中共在香港居然能用到這種殺人手法，更沒想到中共會派出特戰隊的精銳部隊去香港殺人。
還有一個關鍵問題是為啥把人弄個假死後扔水裡，因為這樣死者既不具備活體溺水死亡的特徵，也不具備死屍入水的特徵。因為死者是假死扔到水裡後溺水而亡。相當於吃了一瓶安眠藥扔水裡淹死的，就這個意思。
這名爆料人最後說，「就這個料沒有人會說的出來，也沒有人懂這個，因為懂這個的人都在為共黨效力，只有我給他們踹了。」
上述消息雖然無法證實真偽，但在此前，已經有香港消防人員推斷，這些離奇自殺事件可能是死後投屍，「他殺」嫌疑更高。



近兩個多月來，香港離奇「自殺」案急速飆升。
有民間學者統計，6月12日到9月10日發生109起「自殺」個案。僅從9月1日後的10多天內，也就是8.31太子站事件發生後，「自殺」案例陡然提升至49人。
而且這些自殺案疑點重重，包括墮樓屍體無血跡，反有舊傷，浮屍雙手被捆綁，卻有血跡等等。有些死狀相當恐怖。一女子全裸「墮樓」，屍體從腰部斷為兩截；一名「溺死」女子成乾屍等等。
案發時間段則多集中在早上5至6點，有分析認為，應該是警方擔心被人發現，因此傾向於在凌晨祕密運送屍體，一大早製造「自殺」。
由于8.31事件後不斷傳出警察打死人的說法，加上港鐵拒絕公開當晚太子站的閉路電視錄像片段，更加深了民眾的質疑。
針對這些密集離奇的自殺案，10月6日，美國權威機構AI披露了示威者被港警拘捕、被性侵和「被自殺」的恐怖內幕。
文章說，情報界反饋給他們的報告說，北京政權已在香港警局內，部署了中共軍事部隊，並通過人工智能的面部識別技術定位學生後，將女學生拘禁。
報告顯示，這些女孩們被港警多人強姦。而這些所謂「港警」，實際上是被派往香港並且得到港府批准的大陸警察和安全機構人員。
文章揭露，香港的學生，包括男孩和女孩皆被宣稱是跳水或跳樓自殺。實際上，有一些女性是強姦受害者。而那些宣稱跳樓的則是被脅迫或直接扔下去的，這種「被自殺」在大陸普遍使用。中共的目的是恐嚇學生群體退縮，以使北京接管香港。

Four major doubts about Hong Kong's floating corpses

03 Nov 2019, 02:22

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Hong Kong's ""reverse delivery"" campaign has been burning for several months. Recently, suspicious cases such as suicide and floating bodies in Hong Kong have exploded. In response, a mainland special police revealed that many cases of floating corpses in Hong Kong were carried out by the CCP special forces, including four major points.
The Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign has been going on for more than five months. The news of the Hong Kong police colluding with the CCP’s undercover armed police and the gang’s bloody suppression of demonstrators is endless. In particular, since the 831 Hong Kong police attacked the MTR Prince Edward Station, cases of suspected ""falling down"" and ""floating corpses"" in Hong Kong have appeared frequently, and the actions of the Marine Police to rob the bodies have caused doubts.
The most typical case is Chen Yanlin, a 15-year-old female student who was involved in the reversal and is good at diving. After a few days, she was completely naked. The police said that their suicide was ""no doubt."" However, Chen Yanlin was deeply hydrated when he was alive, but his body was naked when he died. Police testimony and abnormally active fishing movements made people suspicious.

On November 2, the ""Epoch Times"" quoted the news as saying that many cases of floating corpses in Hong Kong were not carried out by the local police, but were the black hands of the Chinese military.
The person who broke the news claimed that he had served in the special police team of the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the many floating corpses in Hong Kong, he consulted a large number of photos for comparison. He is sure that this is the combat method of the CCP Army Special Forces and the Armed Police Special Forces.
The person who broke the news said that a few years ago, he passed the layered selection of the Ministry of Public Security as the special police of the Chinese Communist Party, and exchanged and studied on behalf of the CCP police and the Hong Kong Flying Tigers (SDU). The Hong Kong Flying Tigers is the highest combat force of the Hong Kong Police. Its tactical movement and fighting techniques are very comprehensive. And there is no team in all police in Hong Kong that has more skills than the Flying Tigers.
The Flying Tigers pay attention to two modes of warfare. The first is to control the suspects. In the native language, it is a live capture. The second is to kill the suspects, that is, to kill the commandments. In other words, Hong Kong's Flying Tigers do not have a third type of combat, and their training revolves around these two design tactics.
The person who broke the news said that the Hong Kong floating corpse found today has four main points: 1. The tongue of the body found in Hong Kong water does not extend out of the mouth, thus eliminating the suspicion of strangulation. 2, the hands and feet of the corpse did not show a hook-like shape, thus eliminating the drowning and dying to cast the corpse. 3, according to reports that the corpse is not seriously damaged by internal organs, the bones are not obviously deformed, thus eliminating the usual killing command of the Flying Tigers. 4, the body has no pinholes, bullet holes, electric shocks, thus eliminating the weapon life.
In summary, all the deceased did not exist and were killed by the Hong Kong police! Because the skills and tactics that the Flying Tigers can't do, other Hong Kong police officers can't do it!
The person who broke the news said with certainty that the deceased were basically put into the water in a state of suspended animation, that is to say, there were signs of life before they were put into the water, on the verge of death. This kind of technology is only available to the CCP Army Special Warfare Team, the Armed Police Special Warfare Team, and the Public Security Special Police.
The reason for this is that the training of violent organs in any country in the world is only controlled and killed. Only the CCP has a kind of training that allows the other party to die.
He lamented that this was too horrible. I really didn't expect the CCP to use this murderous method in Hong Kong. I didn't even think that the CCP would send elite troops from the special forces to kill people in Hong Kong.
Another key issue is to throw a person into the water after a fake death, because the deceased does not have the characteristics of living and drowning, nor the characteristics of dead bodies. Because the deceased was thrown into the water after the fake death and drowned. This is equivalent to eating a bottle of sleeping pills and drowning in water.
The person who broke the news finally said, ""No one will say this, and no one knows this, because everyone who knows this is working for the Communist Party. Only I am jealous of them.""
Although the above news could not prove the authenticity, before this, some Hong Kong firefighters had inferred that these bizarre suicides may have been post-mortem and the murder was higher.



In the past two months or so, the bizarre ""suicide"" case in Hong Kong has soared.
According to statistics from folk scholars, 109 cases of ""suicide"" occurred between June 12 and September 10. Only in the more than 10 days after September 1st, that is, after the 8.31 prince station incident, the ""suicide"" case suddenly increased to 49 people.
Moreover, these suicides have many doubts, including the bloody body of the squatter, and the old wounds. The floating corpses are tied, but there are bloodstains and so on. Some deaths are quite scary. A woman is naked, ""the squatter"", the body is broken from the waist into two pieces; a ""dead"" woman becomes a corpse and so on.
The time period of the incident was mostly concentrated at 5 to 6 in the morning. Some analysts believe that the police should be worried about being discovered. Therefore, they tend to secretly transport the body in the early morning and create ""suicide"" in the early morning.
As a result of the repeated police deaths after the 8.31 incident, and the fact that the MTR refused to publicize the CCTV footage of the Prince’s Station that night, it further deepened the public’s doubts.
In response to these intensive and bizarre suicides, on October 6, the US authority AI disclosed the terrorist insider who was arrested, sexually assaulted and ""suicided"" by the Hong Kong police.
The article said that the intelligence community reported to them that the Beijing regime had deployed the Chinese military forces within the Hong Kong police station and detained female students after locating students through artificial intelligence facial recognition technology.
The report shows that these girls were raped by many Hong Kong police officers. These so-called ""Hong Kong Police"" are actually mainland police and security agencies who are sent to Hong Kong and approved by the Hong Kong Government.
The article reveals that Hong Kong students, including boys and girls, are all claimed to have committed diving or jumping from the building. In fact, some women are victims of rape. Those who claim to jump off the building are forced or directly thrown away. This ""suicide"" is commonly used in the mainland. The purpose of the CCP is to intimidate the student group to retreat so that Beijing can take over Hong Kong.
