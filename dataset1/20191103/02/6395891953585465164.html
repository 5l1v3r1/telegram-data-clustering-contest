      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Calgary's Sean Monahan ended a personal 13-game scoreless streak with a goal that proved to be the winner.</p>
      <p>Monahan, Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk scored, and David Rittich recorded the shutout as the Flames beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 3-0 Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Flames (8-6-2) won their second game in two nights and dealt Columbus its fourth straight loss, and second straight at home.</p>
      <p>Rittich stopped 43 shots for his seventh victory and second shutout.</p>
      <p>"Rittich was dialed in and in control all night long," Flames coach Bill Peters said. "It was a real good effort by him. He's been solid all year."</p>
      <p>Columbus (5-6-3) outshot the Flames 43-29 and goalie Joonas Korpisalo lost his third straight start.</p>
      <p>Monahan got the Flames on the board early, beating Korpisalo with a high shot from right in front of the net at 3:44 of the first period. Elias Lindholm and Johnny Gaudreau assisted on Monahan's third goal of the season.</p>
      <p>It was his first goal since Oct. 5.</p>
      <p>"You play in this league a long time, you are going to go through stretches and not find the back of the net," Monahan said. "You've got to focus on the little things. That what I tried to do."</p>
      <p>Calgary led 2-0 after Korpisalo chased a wide shot by Derek Ryan, leaving an open net for Bennett, who buried the puck at 8:20 of the second period for his third goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Matthew Tkachuk made it 3-0 with an empty-net goal at 17:21 of the third.</p>
      <p>Jackets captain Nick Foligno said letting opposing teams get on the board first has been a challenge for Columbus.</p>
      <p>"I think the real tale of this game is honestly our start," he said. "For whatever reason, we have a difficult time setting the tone of how we want to play. I think that's the difference in the game."</p>
      <p>Coach John Tortorella agreed.</p>
      <p>"Our start was terrible," he said. "After that, I thought we played hard. Did we make a lot of plays? No. We just didn't execute. It's unacceptable how we started the game."</p>
      <p>NOTES: Sonny Milano's penalty with 27.5 seconds left in the first period was his sixth in 12 games. ,,, With the win, Calgary started its third back-to-back series of the season, while the Jackets finished their fourth. ... Kole Sherwood, a native of New Albany, Ohio, left in the second period after a punch in the face by Milan Lucic, but later returned.</p>
