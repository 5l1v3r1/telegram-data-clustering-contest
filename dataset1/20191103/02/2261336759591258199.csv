UFC 244 PPV results: Kevin Lee spectacularly KO’s Gregor Gillespie with head kick
03 Nov 2019, 02:33 by Eddie Mercado



The UFC 244 PPV is underway, and the promotion’s #10 ranked lightweight, Kevin Lee, just slept the #11 ranked Gregor Gillespie with a sensational head kick in the first round.
Both men came out popping with the jab. No takedown attempts happened and it seemed pretty even — until Lee landed a massive head kick that totally slumped Gillespie. WOW OH WOW OH WOW!

The win snapped a two-fight losing skid for Lee, and broke up Gillespie’s undefeated record at 13-0. With this sort of performance from Lee, it seems like his move under the wing of Firas Zahabi was a favorable move for the “Motown Phenom.” Don’t be surprised to see Lee elevated in the rankings come Monday, and slated for another top tier opponent in his next outing. Did we forget to say wow, because wow!
Kevin Lee def. Gregor Gillespie by KO at 2:47 of round 1 : Lightweight
