Donald Trump is in attendance at UFC 244, with the US President walking to his seat prior to the start of the pay-per-view portion of the event. Trump got notoriously booed attending a World Series game, but he did get mixed reactions from the crowd during this MMA event.
As he was slowly walking to his seat, Trump was heavily booed by the crowd.









It wasn’t all boos though, there were also some noticeable cheers as he got to his seat, specifically when he started waving to some people.



Dana White has been very vocal about his support of the President, even being part of his campaign a few years back. The show’s headliner fighting for a “BMF” belt, Jorge Masvidal has also voiced support for Trump this week, saying he’s a “cool” and “bad motherf—ker.”
“I think real recognize real,” Masvidal said. “No matter what your views are on Trump as a president, the guy’s a bad (expletive), man. The money that he’s made, the obstacles that he’s conquered. He’s a bad (expletive) in his own way. No matter what your political views are.”
“Trump’s a cool (expletive). I don’t want to get too much into politics though, you know, a lot of my Latin community might be upset at me so I’m not going to dabble into politics right now.”
