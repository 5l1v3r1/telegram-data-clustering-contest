      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> was booed as he took to his seat at UFC 244 in New York on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The president is cageside at Madison Square Garden to watch Nate Diaz take on Jorge Masvidal at the famous combat arena.</p>
      <p>He took his seat shortly before the main card started at 10pm local time and was met by a chorus of jeers.</p>
      <p>Hours earlier, a group of protesters began lining the streets in order to ensure they were there to greet the president.</p>
      <p>It was reported earlier this week that Trump, who has promoted boxing and mixed martial arts fights in the past, would attend the fight.</p>

      <p>And he entered the area with a huge entourage and security detail and took his seat right in front of the action.</p>
      <p>On his way to his seat, Trump was greeted by former boxing world champion Roberto Duran who will be in Masvidal's corner later tonight.</p>
      <p>Diaz and Masvidal clash for the Baddest Motherf***** belt which will be presented to the winner by WWE legend and movie star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.</p>
      <p>And journalists reported long delays as they attempted to check in with reporters asked to leave their equipment to be checked by sniffer dogs before returning.</p>

      <p>And protesters made their presence felt with a long banner which read "#outnow!".</p>
      <p>Trump is a long-time friend of UFC president Dana White who spoke during the Republican's 2016 election campaign.</p>
      <p>White told the Washington Times last year: "That guy gave us our start when nobody would talk to us. No arenas wanted us.</p>
      <p>"Donald Trump has never done anything remotely negative to me ever — except try to compete with me. I’m not going to say anything negative about him and I never have.”</p>
