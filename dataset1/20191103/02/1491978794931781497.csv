Joseph McDonald, 22, allegedly murdered Lucas McDonald last week

A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his seven-week-old baby in suburban Melbourne.
Joseph McDonald, 22, allegedly murdered seven-week-old Lucas McDonald at Clayton, in south-east Melbourne, on Tuesday.
The father, from Benalla in Victoria’s north-east, appeared in the Melbourne magistrates court on Sunday charged with murder.
He did not apply for bail, and his Legal Aid lawyer said it was the man’s first time in custody and requested he be seen by a nurse.
The lawyer also noted the accused was vulnerable in custody due to his age and appearance.
McDonald handed himself in to a Melbourne police station on Saturday.
He has been remanded to reappear in court on Monday for a filing hearing.
