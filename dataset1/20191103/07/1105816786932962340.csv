Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday congratulated his government over the construction of the Kartarpur Corridor in ‘record time’ ahead of the 550th birthday celebrations of the founder of Sikh religion Baba Guru Nanak.
“I want to congratulate our government for readying Kartarpur, in record time, for Guru Nanak jee’s 550th birthday celebrations. Kartarpur ready to welcome Sikh pilgrims,” the prime minister said on his Twitter handle.
The PM also shared multiple images of the fully illuminated building of the complex, including the courtyard, road, and checking counters.



Later, he also presided over a meeting to review the arrangements made for the inauguration of Kartarpur Corridor and facilitation of the Sikh pilgrims coming from India and across the world.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, Interior Minister Brig (retd) Ijaz Ahmed Shah, federal secretaries of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, interior, defence and religious affairs besides special secretary for finance and other senior officers.
The premier expressed satisfaction over the facilities offered to the Sikh pilgrims. Likely to be inaugurated on November 9, the Kartarpur Corridor would make Pakistan a religious hub for Sikhs from India as well as across the globe.
The corridor will provide visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib – the final resting place of Baba Guru Nanak.



According to the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), the first phase of the corridor comprised construction of main corridor up to zero point, main offices at zero point, basic polishing of existing building of Gurdwara, Baradari, Langar Hall, Angetha Sahib, Sarowar, administrative block and the parking area.
The second phase would include accommodation for about 10,000 Yatrees, five- and seven-star hotels and shopping malls.
The Kartarpur Corridor will be inaugurated by the premier on November 9 – three days before the 550th birth anniversary festivities. Thousands of Sikh pilgrims are traveling to Nankana Sahib to celebrate the anniversary of their religious founder.
The agreement to open the corridor was signed between Islamabad and New Delhi in October. The Kartarpur Corridor will allow Sikh pilgirms to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib – one of Sikhism’s holiest pilgrimage sites in Narowal district of Punjab – without a visa.
The corridor – about six kilometres long – connects Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, the last resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev Ji, with Dera Baba Nanak Sahib, another Sikh holy site in the Indian state of Punjab.
