      <p>Nigel Farage said he has been twice offered a peerage, with the Brexit Party leader claiming it is one of a number of “baubles” put forward by the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party could play a significant role at the December 12 General Election but Boris Johnson has ruled out an election pact.</p>
      <p>If the party did stand down hundreds of candidates across the country it would improve the chances of Mr Johnson’s Tories gaining a majority or remaining the largest party in a hung parliament.</p>
      <blockquote>When you get it out of the fridge, it's really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible</blockquote>
      <p>Speaking to the Sunday Times, Farage said he would decide this coming week where he would stand, with Thurrock a “possibility” but it “might make more sense” if he stood in a Labour leave seat in the north.</p>
      <p>Thurrock was a target seat for Mr Farage’s former party Ukip in 2017.</p>
      <p>At the EU referendum, 72.3% of people cast their ballots in favour of Leave, the second highest proportion among the East of England’s 47 voting areas.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal, Mr Farage told the paper it was like a piece of cheese.</p>
      <p>“When you get it out of the fridge, it’s really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible.”</p>
