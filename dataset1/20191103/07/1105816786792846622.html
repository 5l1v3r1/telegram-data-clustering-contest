      <p><b>NEW YORK: </b>President Donald Trump was loudly booed on Saturday for the second time in a week at a sporting event as he attended a UFC fight in New York.</p>
      <p>Trump, wearing a dark suit and a red tie, pumped his fist and waved at the crowd as he walked into the city’s iconic Madison Square Garden arena on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>There was no repeat of the loud chants of “lock him up” that greeted Trump when he attended a World Series baseball game last weekend, but loud jeers rung out.</p>
      <p>Many mixed martial arts fans also clapped and cheered as Trump took his seat just 15 feet from the cage where the UFC was set to award the “BMF” belt.</p>

      <p>Several dozen protesters carrying placards with slogans such as “Trump/Pence Out Now!” and “Headlock Him Up” demonstrated outside the 20,000-seat venue as Trump arrived for the pay-per-view spectacle.</p>
      <p>The president, 73, looked on in concern as lightweight Kevin Lee delivered a vicious left kick to rival Gregor Gillespie’s face during the first bout on the main card.</p>
      <p>The contact, which left the fighter sprawled on the ground for around 30 seconds, drew loud gasps from the capacity crowd as they watched the slow-motion replay of his face being squished.</p>
      <p>Trump could be seen clapping in support when Gillespie finally got to his feet.</p>
      <p>The president was attending the fight night with sons Donald Jr and Eric.</p>
      <p>Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz were due to slug it out for the “BMF” belt later Saturday.</p>
