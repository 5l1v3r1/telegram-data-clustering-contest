薄如蟬翼用來形容布料，會給人一種性感與輕柔的感覺，那如果用來形容火鍋肉片呢？日前有民眾網友在吃到飽火鍋店用餐，服務生送上數盒肉片，其中一盒當真是薄如蟬翼，讓他傻眼「這刀工，只有在小當家裡才看得到」。
去吃到飽的火鍋店就是為了痛快吃肉，有網友在「爆怨公社」發文表示，今天用餐根本碰上小當家，送上來的其中一盒肉片薄到會透光，盒子的紋路清楚可見，一丟下鍋後就快撈不到，讓人又傻眼又無奈，表示「我一直以為薄到透光的肉片只有動漫才會出現」。
這等神祕刀工吸引許多網友回應，紛紛笑說「快比岡本0.02還要薄了」、「只融你鍋、不融你口」、「薄的讓你忘了它的存在」、「這個要揉成一團再丟進去煮啦」，也有人表示，「幸好是吃飽，萬一單點還送上這個，老闆天天被客訴吧」。
