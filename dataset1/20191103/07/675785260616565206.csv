Accrington Stanley are the surprise winners of a league of shame showing England's dirtiest team - but where do you side figure?
Clubs such as Leeds United and Millwall have long held reputations for being “dirty”.
But new Mirror Sport analysis of disciplinary records over the last decade suggests that it’s Accrington Stanley who have the worst discipline in English football.
The Lancashire club have picked up 52 red cards in 429 league games over the last 10 seasons.
That works out as one every 8.3 matches.

No club to have played in the top four divisions of English football in each of those campaigns has had players sent off more regularly.
Peterborough have the next worst record at one red every 8.6 games.
Southend come next with one every 8.8 games, then Sunderland (8.9 games), Northampton (9.1 games), Stevenage (9.3 games) and Brighton (9.7 games).
“Dirty Leeds” have only the joint 11th worst record with one red every 10.0 matches.

When it comes to fair play, Derby County top the league.
The Rams have only seen red 17 times in 428 matches, the equivalent of one every 25.2 matches.
Burnley have the next best record with one red every 21.8 games.
The Clarets are followed by Cardiff (one every 21.7 games), Exeter (21.5), Bournemuth (20.6) and Crewe (19.5).
