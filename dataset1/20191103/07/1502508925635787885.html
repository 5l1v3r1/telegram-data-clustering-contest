      <p>India is committed to further improving its people-friendly <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tax">tax </a>regime, Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi </a>said, as Asia’s third-largest economy seeks to attract more overseas investment to spur growth.</p>
      <p>The government has cut corporate <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tax">tax </a>rates and introduced a nationwide goods-and-services charge to integrate the nation’s economy, Modi said in a speech at Aditya Bira Group’s golden jubilee celebrations in Thailand on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We want to work toward making it even more people friendly,” he said.</p>
      <p>Attracting new investment is key to creating jobs and boosting growth in the economy, which slowed to a six-year low growth rate of 5 per cent in the quarter ended June. India is considering <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tax">tax </a>relief for individuals as it looks at measures to accelerate consumer demand.</p>
      <p>The next pulse check for the economy is due on Nov. 29, when the government will publish gross domestic product data for the July-September period. Modi aims to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025.</p>
      <p>“For investment and easy business, come to India,” Modi said. The nation welcomes investors who are keen on innovation and plan to start new businesses, he said.</p>
