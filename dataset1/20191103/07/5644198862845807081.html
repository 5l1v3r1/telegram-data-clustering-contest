      <p>FRANKFURT: The eastern German city of Dresden has declared a "Nazi emergency" as officials warned of a rise in far-right support and violence.</p>
      <p>The city is the birthplace of the Islamophobic Pegida movement, which holds weekly rallies here, while the anti-immigration Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) party won 28 per cent in September regional elections.</p>

      <p>Dresden's city council on Wednesday backed a resolution against far-right extremism with the title "Nazinotstand", or "Nazi emergency".</p>
      <p>It was brought by Max Aschenbach, a local councillor for left-leaning satirical party Die Partei, who told the DPA news agency that "this city has a Nazi problem".</p>
      <p>The resolution said the city was "worried that anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, discriminatory and far-right positions which include violence" were on the rise in Dresden.</p>
      <p>It called for a "strengthening of a democratic culture", making a priority of "the protection of minorities, human rights and victims of extreme-right violence".</p>
      <p>The motion also stressed the importance to fight "anti-Semitism, racism and Islamophobia".</p>
      <p>The resolution was approved by 39 council member votes against 29.</p>
      <p>It was backed by the left and liberal parties, but rejected not only by the AfD members but also by centre-right Christian Democrats who said it should not have targeted right-wing extremism only.</p>
      <p>"The title is clearly pointed," said Thomas Loeser, a council member for the Green party.</p>
      <p>"But we, as the city community, clearly declare our support for those who oppose racism and anti-Semitism, and expect everybody else to do the same," he said.</p>
