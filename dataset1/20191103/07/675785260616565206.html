      <h2>Analysis of disciplinary records over the last decade has discovered which club has the worst discipline in English football</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T07:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Dubas-Fisher, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-dubas-fisher/</a></address>
      <p>Accrington Stanley are the surprise winners of a league of shame showing England's dirtiest team - but where do you side figure?</p>
      <p>Clubs such as Leeds United and Millwall have long held reputations for being “dirty”.</p>
      <p>But new Mirror Sport analysis of disciplinary records over the last decade suggests that it’s Accrington Stanley who have the worst discipline in English football.</p>
      <p>The Lancashire club have picked up 52 red cards in 429 league games over the last 10 seasons.</p>
      <p>That works out as one every 8.3 matches.</p>

      <p>Southend come next with one every 8.8 games, then Sunderland (8.9 games), Northampton (9.1 games), Stevenage (9.3 games) and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> (9.7 games).</p>
