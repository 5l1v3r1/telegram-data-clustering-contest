Call of Duty: Modern Warfare on PC Gets a Huge 8GB Patch
03 Nov 2019, 07:46 by Mike Sanders



I have to admit that since the release of Call of Duty Modern Warfare last month, the game has successfully been able to drag me back into the franchise for the first time in 10 years. Not that I’m complaining.
While playing with friends (both on PC and console) has been a genuinely fun experience, what has perhaps surprised me the most (particularly in this modern gaming world) is that this launched in a very solid state. Yes, there are problems, but truthfully not many of them.
If you are, however, planning on jumping in for some Call of Duty action on your PC today, then you might want to get your Battle.net launcher open now. A huge 8GB patch has arrived to look to fix some of the little problems lurking within Call of Duty Modern Warfare.



Call of Duty Modern Warfare
As part of the official patch notes, the update includes the following fixes/repairs:

More fixes to prevent crashes and improve stability across all platforms
Battlechatter has been removed from tactical, one-life modes
APCs and Tanks in Ground War no longer award points towards a nuke
Fix for charms affecting weapon performance when firing from the hip
Claymores: Stun grenades can now force claymores into a disabled state for 3 seconds
Footsteps: Adjustments to tame the 3rd person footsteps. They will now filter out based on occlusion more.
Fix to an issue where Tac Inserts could cause players to spawn out of bounds
Fix for the gold camo not unlocking on the .357

Playlist Update

NVG (TDM only)
Ground War
Gunfight
Kill Confirmed
FFA






What Do We Think?
Having tried the patch, there are definite improvements in the overall feel of the game. Particularly to the aforementioned ‘footsteps’ which I did notice as a problem myself. Admittedly, there are still a few issues lurking within the game. As above, however, I can’t stress enough just how surprisingly good this game has been since its release.
If you are, therefore, sitting on the fence with this one, I can thoroughly recommend it and, despite the huge size of this 8GB patch making it appear that this was (or is) a bit of a mess, it honestly really isn’t!
