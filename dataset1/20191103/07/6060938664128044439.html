      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> promised fans on his birthday that he will definitely announce a film soon, and seems like all those rumours about the actor working with South filmmaker Atlee could soon be proved right. Atlee and his wife Priya was snapped last night at Shah Rukh Khan’s birthday celebrations and the filmmaker also shared a picture of them from the party. And his caption clearly spelled the admiration he has for the actor, “love u sir,” shared Atlee. The filmmaker is currently riding high on the success of his last release ‘Bigil’, which has set the cash registers ringing like never before.</p>

      <p>In a grand celebration last night, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">SRK</a> greeted a packed auditorium of fans and was welcomed on stage with hoots and cheers. Blowing kisses to his fans, Shah Rukh Khan cut a grand three-tiered golden and black cake. Fans were eager for a big announcement from the actor regarding his next movie and SRK promised that an official announcement will be made in a couple of months, once the film goes on floors. The actor also revealed that he is taking “utmost” care not to let his fans down.</p>
      <p>Reports suggested that Shah Rukh Khan’s collaboration with Atlee is titled ‘Sanki’ and will feature the actor in the role of a hot-headed hero. The film will be a commercial potboiler and we are all ears for more deets on this exciting project.</p>
