      <p>IRVING, Texas - ExxonMobil is finally cashing in on America's shale oil boom. But soft crude prices are dinging the oil giant's bottom line.</p>
      <p>Exxon said Friday its third-quarter <a href="https://news.exxonmobil.com/press-release/exxonmobil-earns-32-billion-third-quarter-2019">profit tumbled 49% to $3.2 billion</a> as stronger production was overwhelmed by lower prices. Wall Street was bracing for an even steeper decline.</p>
      <p>Like other oil titans, Exxon was slow to take advantage of the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/15/investing/texas-oil-permian-basin-energen/index.html">oil boom happening in its backyard</a>. But Exxon has since ramped up spending, especially in the West Texas <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/investing/permian-basin-oil-texas/index.html">shale hotbed of the Permian Basin.</a></p>
      <p>The company reported a 70% spike in Permian shale output, which represents staggering growth for an oil producer the size of Exxon.</p>
      <p>Those investments helped boost Exxon's once-stagnant production. The company's total oil production rose 4%, excluding asset sales and other items.</p>
      <p>"We are making excellent progress on our long-term growth strategy," Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in a statement that highlighted the Permian strength.</p>
      <p>However, that progress came at a cost. Exxon's capital spending jumped 17%, a contrast from the relative restraint some of its peers are showing.</p>
      <p>And the oil market hasn't cooperated. Slow economic growth, trade tensions and excess supply have kept a lid on prices. US oil prices ended the third quarter at around $50 a barrel, compared with nearly $70 a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Exxon said weak prices slashed its drilling profit by $1.5 billion during the third quarter. The segment's US division suffered a 94% plunge in earnings to just $37 million. Exxon explained that production growth was "more than offset by lower prices and higher growth-related expenses."</p>
      <p>The results still managed to exceed Wall Street's expectations. Exxon's share price ticked 1% higher on Friday.</p>
      <p>Exxon's profit drop comes as the company is mired in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/us/exxonmobil-trial-climate-change-tillerson/index.html">high-stakes legal battle in New York</a>. The oil giant has denied accusations of duping investors about the cost of climate change regulations.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, rival Chevron posted results on Friday that were worse than investors anticipated. Chevron's profit dropped 36% and its revenue retreated because of lower prices.</p>
      <p>Like Exxon, Chevron continues to rapidly build up its shale operations. The company's Permian Basin oil production totaled 455,000 barrels per day, up 35% from a year ago.</p>
