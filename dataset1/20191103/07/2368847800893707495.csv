王友群：加速中共垮台的四中全會

03 Nov 2019, 07:46

10月24日，美國副總統彭斯就中美關係發表第二次重要演講時，再次引用中國古語：「人見目前，天見久遠」。這八個中國字，內涵非常深刻，用來認識中共四中全會，很有幫助。

四中全會召開的歷史大背景

2002年，貴州省平塘縣掌布鄉發現了一塊距今2.7億年的「藏字石」，上面赫然顯現「中國共產黨亡」6個大字。這塊非人工雕鑿的「藏字石」問世，將「天滅中共」的天機告訴了世人。
2004年11月，大紀元發表系列社論《九評共產黨》，第一次將中共反天、反地、反人類、反神佛的本質昭告天下，從此，拉開了「天滅中共」的序幕。
2019年6月，香港爆發有史以來最大規模的反抗中共暴政的反送中運動，「天滅中共」的口號寫滿香港的大街小巷，在許多集會、遊行、示威活動中，「天滅中共」的口號響徹天宇。今天，我看到一張照片，在中國大陸的一座立交橋上，也有人寫了「天滅中共」4個大字！
2019年，是中共老宗祖宗馬克思發表《共產黨宣言》171周年。20世紀80年代末90年代初，蘇聯東歐各國共產黨政權，一夜之間，全部垮台。這是「天滅共產黨」的歷史大事件。之後，中共又苟延殘喘近30年。現在，到了「天」滅掉地球上最後一個最大的共產主義政黨——中共的時候了。
10月28日，北京出現近10年未曾有過的大風沙塵天氣，狂風飛舞，黃沙漫天，整個北京城籠罩在一片烏煙瘴氣之中。
正是在這樣的歷史大背景下，中共四中全會10月28日在北京召開。
四中全會召開前 中共在幹什麼？
中共四中全會召開前幹的事很多，擇其要者有四：

迫害法輪功20年 還在繼續迫害

1999年7月20日，當時的中共獨裁者江澤民發動對法輪功的瘋狂大迫害。這場迫害已持續20年，製造了21世紀全世界最大的人權災難。至今，迫害仍在繼續。
據明慧網消息，1至9月，中共警察至少綁架了4805名法輪功學員，528人被非法判刑。8月15日，吉林省四平市梨樹縣康平社區法輪功學員孟祥岐一家9口被非法綁架。這9個人分別是：孟祥歧，孟的岳父姚德義，岳母付貴華，母親王桂珍，父親孟凡軍，妻子於健萍的姐姐於健莉與丈夫王東吉、於健莉的公公王克民、婆婆王鳳芝。家中只剩孟祥岐的妻子於健萍和3個月的嬰兒，這兩人也被警察監視居住。
10月26日，美國福克斯新聞台發表《倖存者和受害者關於駭人聽聞的由國家政府批准的中國器官活摘》的報導，介紹了今年6月17日倫敦「獨立人民法庭」的終審裁決，並採訪了幾位證人。該法庭裁決：中共反人類罪成立，其活摘良心犯器官已大規模存在多年，並仍在進行，法輪功學員是器官供應的最主要來源。
中共大規模活摘法輪功學員器官，被稱為「這個星球上前所未有的罪行」。

香港被折騰到有史以來最黑暗

中共收回香港僅22年，卻一再違背它在《中英聯合聲明》中關於「一國兩制」的承諾，管了大量「國防與外交」之外不該管的事，一步一步侵蝕香港的自由。到今年6月，中共折騰香港22年積累下來的所有矛盾，以「反送中運動」的形式，來了一個總爆發。
4個多月來，中共將過去20年在中國大陸迫害法輪功的各種流氓手法，直接搬到香港的大街小巷，輪番上演「高壓」與「欺騙」的丑戲。至今為止，香港警方已發射5000多枚催淚彈，抓捕近3000人，最小的僅12歲。15歲的少女陳彥霖，被發現裸體浮屍海上。有港人到台灣控訴，一名國中女生遭4個以上黑警輪姦。據報導，已有100多人「自殺」，「自殺」案例還在不斷增加。不少人被懷疑是黑警殺害後「被自殺」。
11月2日，香港多區舉行集會和遊行，警方隨後暴力清場。當晚抓捕200多人，創下一天內抓人最高記錄。

中國經濟被折騰到崩潰的邊緣

9月，中共的外匯儲備為3.09萬億美元。日本大和資本2018年8月的研究報告顯示，中共外匯管理局公布的外債總額，沒有包括中國企業在香港、紐約、開曼群島和英屬維京群島等地發行的美元債。如果把這些美元債都算在內，中共外債總額可能在3萬億到3.5萬億美元，比官方公布的數據高出1萬多億美元。據此，外債與外儲相抵，中共的外匯儲備可能是負數！
10月18日，中共國家統計局公布今年第三季GDP增長6%。10月21日，美國總統川普表示，真實情況可能是負數。「他們（中共）說今年情況很糟糕，是57年以來最糟糕的情況。如果他們自己都這麼說，那代表情況比這更糟。」9月，中國外流資金達890億美元。三星、英特爾、諾基亞、日東電工等世界級企業，紛紛撤離中國。
產業鏈移出中國的後果是：外匯大減、稅收大減、工業產值大減、進出口大減、失業大增！

到處樹敵 國際上沒有一個真朋友

今年10月1日，是中共「國慶」70周年「大慶」。中共舉辦了人類有史以來規模最大、耗資最多、最盛大隆重的閱兵式，卻沒有邀請一位外國元首或政府首腦觀禮。為什麼？因為中共頑固堅持被實踐反覆證明是禍害人類的馬克思主義的歪理邪說，堅持拒絕普世價值，與世界各國漸行漸遠，在全世界沒有一個真朋友。
四中全會只會加速中共垮台作為一個正常的政黨，一年開一次中央全會，肯定會聚焦民眾最關心的重大問題。上述4大問題，中共四中全會一個也沒有給予正常的關注，更沒有給出可行的解決辦法。
四中全會都幹了些啥？5000多字的四中全會公報，「堅持」一詞出現57次。「堅持」什麼呢？一句話，堅持黨對一切的領導，即所謂「黨政軍學民、東西南北中，黨領導一切」。
黨領導迫害法輪功20年，14億中國人的「信仰自由、言論自由、免於恐懼的自由、免於匱乏的自由」全部被剝奪，黨還要繼續領導迫害法輪功；黨領導香港22年，把曾經光彩萬千的「東方之珠」變得暗無天日，黨還準備繼續把「東方之珠」打碎；1949年至1978年，黨領導搞社會主義30年，把中國經濟搞到崩潰的邊緣；1979年至2019年，黨領導「改革開放」40年，中國經濟又被搞到崩潰的邊緣，黨還將控制一切經濟領域，窒息一切創新活力；黨領導政權70年，環顧世界，中共的敵人遍天下，黨還將繼續與自由民主的歷史大潮背道而馳。
堅持黨的領導，用最簡單的話來說，就是繼續作死。

為什麼說四中全會將加速中共垮台？

法輪功學員信神敬神，按照「真、善、忍」做好人，於國於民有百利而無一害。中共卻持續迫害法輪功20年，至今仍在喪心病狂地迫害。上面提到的吉林省四平市警方一天將一家9口人全部抓起來，就是中共末日瘋狂的具體體現。
「不信神，假、惡、鬥」，這6個字，這是中共的本質，也是當今中國一切問題的癥結所在。
四中全會依然在維護那個不信神的黨，依然充滿假話、大話、空話，依然對人民「懷惡意」，依然「鬥」字當頭！
中國傳統文化講：「人在做，天在看」，「人算不如天算」，「順天而行，天必助之」。這個「天」就是神。
中共不信神，不敬神，不相信做壞事，老天爺看得清清楚楚，天不怕，地不怕，什麼喪天害理的事都敢幹。
在中美貿易戰爆發、中共面臨全面危機之際，中共不僅不知內省，反而發瘋似地毀滅中國人對神的信仰。
2月2日，位於河北平山縣的世界最高摩崖石刻觀音像，上半身被炸得粉碎；幾天後，為防止觀音像被重建，下半身被徹底炸毀！此後，全國各地頻傳各種荒唐至極的毀佛事件。
一位佛教徒氣憤地說：「拆佛像，毀經書，逼出家人還俗，現在趕上文化大革命了，哪有信仰自由啊？」「共產黨就是怕人都信佛，沒人信黨了。」
中共「假、惡、鬥」體現在內政外交的一切領域。
茲舉一例。四中全全談到香港時，提出要「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。這是針對所謂「港獨」的。
「港獨」本身是個偽命題。絕大多數香港人並沒有提出「香港獨立」問題，這不是香港的主流民意。
反送中運動爆發以來，中共不斷炒作「港獨」話題，目的是為暴力鎮壓找藉口。四中全會提出這麼個整治「港獨」的辦法來，只會激化香港的矛盾。
尤其需要指出的是，中共才是「分裂中國」、「危害國家安全」的罪魁禍首。
1931年11月7日，日本侵占中國東北三省、國難當頭之際，中共在中華民國境內的江西瑞金成立「國中之國」——中華蘇維埃共和國。《中華蘇維埃共和國憲法》第十四條規定：「承認中國境內少數民族的民族自決權，一直承認到各弱小民族有同中國脫離，自己成立獨立的國家的權利。」
1999年12月9日以來，中共獨裁者江澤民將相當於40多個台灣的中國領土無條件送給俄羅斯等國。中共沒有一個黨小組、黨支部、黨總支、黨組、黨委，對此「分裂中國」、「危害國家安全」的滔天大罪，說一個「不」字！
作為馬列子孫，中共不僅不愛中國，不愛中國人，不愛中國文化，而且是全世界最大的賣國政黨！
2004年，中共以「維護國家安全」為藉口，在香港強推23條立法，導致50萬人上街，最後不得不撤回；今年，中共在香港強推「送中條例」，導致200萬人上街，最後，不得不撤回。
目前，香港危局無解，中共四中全會又提出這麼個蠢招。是否中共又想在香港強推23條立法？是否中共不把香港折騰成「死港」不算完？
歷朝歷代，某個王朝要滅亡時，必定是病入膏肓，無藥可醫，無人能回天，只會隨著歷史的慣性，往死路上滑。
中共亦然。2019年的中共，已成為全世界最腐敗的政黨。中共四中全會的57個「堅持」，全都是逆天意而行。
如此「堅持」下去，中共將與全球正義力量為敵；最後被徹底剷除。

Wang Youqun: Accelerating the Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC

03 Nov 2019, 07:46

On October 24, when US Vice President Pence published his second important speech on Sino-US relations, he once again quoted the old Chinese saying: ""People see the present, the sky is long."" These eight Chinese characters have very profound connotations and are very helpful for understanding the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party.

The historical background of the Fourth Plenary Session

In 2002, a 270 million-year-old ""Tibetan Stone"" was discovered in Zhangbu Township, Pingtang County, Guizhou Province. The six characters of ""The Chinese Communist Party"" were revealed. This non-artificially carved ""hidden stone"" came out and told the world the ""celestial CCP"".
In November 2004, the Epoch Times published a series of editorials, ""The Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party."" For the first time, the CCP’s anti-天, anti-land, anti-human, and anti-God Buddha essences were revealed to the world. Since then, the ""Tianzhu CCP"" has been opened. prelude.
In June 2019, Hong Kong broke out the largest anti-delivery campaign against the CCP's tyranny in history. The slogan of ""Tianzhu CCP"" was written in the streets of Hong Kong. In many gatherings, demonstrations, demonstrations, ""the CCP The slogan resounded through Tianyu. Today, I saw a photo. On an overpass in mainland China, some people wrote the four characters of ""Tianzhu CCP""!
In 2019, it was the 171st anniversary of the Communist Party’s ancestor Marx’s publication of the Communist Manifesto. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the communist regimes of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries collapsed overnight. This is a major historical event of ""the annihilation of the Communist Party."" After that, the CCP has been lingering for nearly 30 years. Now, it is time for the ""Tian"" to destroy the last largest communist party on the planet, the CCP.
On October 28th, there were windy and dusty weather in Beijing that had never been seen in the past 10 years. The wind fluttered and the sand was full of clouds. The entire Beijing city was covered in black smoke.
It is in this historical context that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party was held in Beijing on October 28.
Before the Fourth Plenary Session, what was the CCP doing?
There are many things to do before the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party. There are four people who choose them:

Persecution of Falun Gong for 20 years, continue to persecute

On July 20, 1999, the then CCP dictator Jiang Zemin launched a crazy persecution of Falun Gong. The persecution has lasted for 20 years, creating the world’s largest human rights disaster in the 21st century. So far, the persecution is still going on.
According to Minghui.com, from January to September, the Chinese Communist Party police kidnapped at least 4,805 Falun Gong practitioners and 528 were illegally sentenced. On August 15, a 9-member family of Falun Gong practitioners from the Kangping community in Lishu County, Siping City, Jilin Province was illegally abducted. The nine people are: Meng Xiangqi, Meng's father-in-law Yao Deyi, mother-in-law Fu Guihua, mother Wang Guizhen, father Meng Fanjun, wife Yu Jianping's sister Yu Jianli and husband Wang Dongji, Yu Jianli's father-in-law Wang Kemin, mother-in-law Wang Fengzhi. There are only Meng Xiangyu's wife, Yu Jianping, and a three-month-old baby. The two are also under police surveillance.
On October 26th, Fox News published a report on Survivors and Victims about the appalling Chinese organ-approved Chinese organ harvest, which introduced the final judgment of the Independent People's Court in London on June 17 this year. Interviewed several witnesses. The court ruled that the CCP’s crime against humanity was established, and its organ harvesting conscience has been on the large scale for many years and is still in progress. Falun Gong practitioners are the main source of organ supply.
The large-scale live harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese Communist Party is called ""an unprecedented crime on this planet.""

Hong Kong is tossed to the darkest ever

The Chinese Communist Party has only recovered Hong Kong for only 22 years, but it has repeatedly violated its commitment to ""one country, two systems"" in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. It has taken a lot of things beyond ""national defense and diplomacy"" and has eroded Hong Kong's freedom step by step. By June of this year, the CCP had tossed all the contradictions accumulated in Hong Kong for 22 years, and in the form of ""reverse delivery movement"", a total outbreak came.
For more than four months, the CCP has moved all kinds of hooligans that have persecuted Falun Gong in mainland China to the streets of Hong Kong in the past 20 years, taking turns to stage the ugly drama of ""high pressure"" and ""deception."" So far, the Hong Kong police have launched more than 5,000 tear gas bombs, arresting nearly 3,000 people, the youngest being only 12 years old. Chen Yanlin, a 15-year-old girl, was found naked on the sea. Some Hong Kong people have complained to Taiwan that a girl from a middle school has been raped by more than four black police officers. According to reports, more than 100 people have ""suicide"" and the number of ""suicides"" is increasing. Many people are suspected of being ""suicided"" after the black police killed.
On November 2nd, Hong Kong held a rally and a parade in various districts. The police then violently cleared the scene. More than 200 people were arrested that night, setting a record for the next day.

The Chinese economy is tossed to the brink of collapse

In September, the CCP’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $3.09 trillion. According to a research report by Daiwa Capital of Japan in August 2018, the total foreign debts announced by the CCP Foreign Exchange Administration did not include US dollar bonds issued by Chinese companies in Hong Kong, New York, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands. If these dollar debts are included, the total foreign debt of the CCP may be between $3 trillion and $3.5 trillion, which is more than $1 trillion more than the officially published data. According to this, the foreign debt and the foreign reserves are offset, the CCP's foreign exchange reserves may be negative!
On October 18, the National Bureau of Statistics of the Communist Party of China announced that its GDP growth in the third quarter of this year was 6%. On October 21, US President Trump said that the real situation may be negative. ""They (the CCP) said that this year's situation is very bad, the worst situation in 57 years. If they say so, it means the situation is worse than this."" In September, China's outflow of funds reached $89 billion. World-class companies such as Samsung, Intel, Nokia, and Nitto Denko have withdrawn from China.
The consequences of the industrial chain moving out of China are: large foreign exchange reduction, large tax reduction, industrial output value reduction, import and export reduction, and unemployment increase!

Enemy everywhere, there is no real friend in the world.

On October 1 this year, it was the 70th anniversary of the ""National Day"" of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP has held the largest, most expensive, and most grand military parade in the history of mankind, but did not invite a foreign head of state or government to pay tribute. why? Because the CCP’s stubborn persistence in practice has repeatedly proved to be a Marxist fallacies and evils that harm humanity, insisting on rejecting universal values, and gradually drifting away from countries around the world, without a true friend in the world.
The Fourth Plenary Session will only speed up the CCP’s collapse as a normal political party. Opening a Central Plenary Session once a year will definitely focus on the major issues that the people are most concerned about. The above four major issues, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party did not give normal attention, and did not give a feasible solution.
Did the Fourth Plenary Session do something? The twentieth plenum bulletin of more than 5,000 words, the word ""persistence"" appeared 57 times. What is ""persistence""? In a word, we must uphold the party’s leadership over everything, that is, the so-called ""party, government, and the people, the East, the West, and the Middle East. The party leads everything.""
The party leaders persecuted Falun Gong for 20 years, and the 1.4 billion Chinese ""freedom of belief, freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from want"" were all deprived, and the party must continue to lead the persecution of Falun Gong. The party led Hong Kong for 22 years. The once-famous ""Pearl of the Orient"" has become dark and the party is still preparing to continue to break the ""Pearl of the Orient""; from 1949 to 1978, the party leaders engaged in socialism for 30 years, bringing the Chinese economy to the brink of collapse; Between 1979 and 2019, the party led the ""reform and opening up"" for 40 years, and the Chinese economy was on the verge of collapse. The party will also control all economic fields and suffocate all innovations. The party leads the regime for 70 years, looking around the world, the CCP's enemies. Throughout the world, the party will continue to run counter to the historical tide of freedom and democracy.
Upholding the leadership of the party, in the simplest terms, is to continue to die.

Why do the Fourth Plenary Session accelerate the collapse of the CCP?

Falun Gong practitioners believe in God and respect God. They do good deeds in accordance with ""truthfulness, goodness, and forbearance."" The CCP has continued to persecute Falun Gong for 20 years and is still ruthlessly persecuted. The above-mentioned police in Siping City, Jilin Province, arrested all 9 people in one day, which is the concrete manifestation of the madness of the Chinese Communist Party.
""Do not believe in God, false, evil, fighting"", these six words, this is the essence of the CCP, but also the crux of all problems in China today.
The Fourth Plenary Session is still maintaining the party that does not believe in God. It is still full of lie, big words, and empty words. It is still ""insidious"" to the people, and it is still ""word""!
Chinese traditional culture says: ""People are doing, the sky is watching."" ""People are not as good as days."" ""Going by the sky, Heaven will help."" This ""day"" is God.
The CCP does not believe in God, does not respect God, does not believe in doing bad things, God can see clearly, the sky is not afraid, the land is not afraid, and everything that is ruined is dare to do.
At a time when the Sino-US trade war broke out and the CCP faced a full-scale crisis, the CCP not only did not know the introspection, but madly destroyed the Chinese people's belief in God.
On February 2nd, the world's highest cliff stone statue in Pingshan County, Hebei Province, the upper body was blown up and crushed; a few days later, in order to prevent the Guanyin image from being reconstructed, the lower body was completely blown up! Since then, various ridiculous ruinous incidents have been circulated throughout the country.
A Buddhist said angrily: ""Removing the Buddha image, destroying the scriptures, forcing the family to return to the customs, and now catching up with the Cultural Revolution, how can freedom of belief?"" ""The Communist Party is afraid that everyone believes in Buddha, no one believes in the party.""
The CCP’s ""fake, evil, and fighting"" is reflected in all areas of internal and external diplomacy.
Let me give you an example. When the four countries talked about Hong Kong, they proposed to ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security."" This is for the so-called ""Hong Kong independence.""
""Hong Kong independence"" itself is a false proposition. The vast majority of Hong Kong people have not raised the issue of ""Hong Kong independence"". This is not the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong.
Since the outbreak of the campaign, the CCP has been hyping the topic of ""Hong Kong independence"" with the aim of making excuses for violent suppression. The Fourth Plenary Session proposes such a rectification of ""Hong Kong independence"", which will only intensify the contradictions in Hong Kong.
In particular, it is necessary to point out that the CCP is the chief culprit in ""split China"" and ""endangering national security.""
On November 7, 1931, when Japan invaded the three provinces of Northeast China and the national disaster, the CCP established the ""State of the Middle Kingdom"" - the Soviet Republic of China in the Republic of China. Article 14 of the Constitution of the Chinese Soviet Republic states: ""Recognizing the right of ethnic minorities in China to self-determination has always recognized that all weak and small nations have the right to separate themselves from China and establish an independent state.""
Since December 9, 1999, Jiang Zemin, the dictator of the Chinese Communist Party, has unconditionally sent more than 40 Chinese territory of Taiwan to Russia and other countries. The CCP does not have a party group, a party branch, a party branch, a party group, or a party committee. It is a big crime to ""separate China"" and ""endanger national security.""
As a descendant of Marx, the CCP not only does not love China, does not love Chinese, does not love Chinese culture, and is the world's largest patriotic party!
In 2004, under the pretext of ""maintaining national security"", the CCP pushed 23 pieces of legislation in Hong Kong, causing 500,000 people to go to the streets and finally had to withdraw. This year, the CCP pushed the ""Send Regulations"" in Hong Kong, resulting in 2 million people. Going to the streets, in the end, had to withdraw.
At present, the Hong Kong crisis has no solution, and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has raised such a stupid move. Does the CCP want to push 23 pieces of legislation in Hong Kong? Does the CCP not toss Hong Kong into a ""dead port""?
During the dynasties of the dynasties, when a certain dynasty was to perish, it must be ill and ill. No medicine can be used for medical treatment. No one can return to the sky. It will only slide along the road of inertia with the inertia of history.
The CCP is also true. The CCP of 2019 has become the most corrupt political party in the world. The 57 ""persistences"" of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party are all against the will of God.
In such a ""persistence"", the CCP will be the enemy of global justice forces; it will be completely eradicated.
