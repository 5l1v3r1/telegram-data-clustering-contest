暴雪總裁再談聰哥事件：不贊成、也未授權網易「維護國家尊嚴」的貼文
03 Nov 2019, 07:13 by 楊政勳, 楊政勳

暴雪總裁J. Allen Brack於2019暴雪嘉年華（2019BlizzCon）開幕式時，針對「聰哥事件」道歉，坦承當初處理這件事時「太快做出決策，後來跟玩家的溝通又太慢」，並表示願意接受外界指責。但網友反應兩極，不買帳的網友認為他表達得太模糊，且仍然沒有收回懲處，如今J. Allen Brack在接受外媒PC Gamer的最新採訪中，也談到他在開幕式上的談話，並解釋為何不收回懲處的原因。


此外，他也提到聰哥事件發生後，暴雪的中國發行商網易在爐石戰記微博發布「同時，我們也將一如既往地堅決維護國家尊嚴」的貼文，並沒有受到暴雪的授權與核准，而且就算網易提出要求，暴雪也不會核准。

以下是PC Gamer與J. Allen Brack的訪談內容：
PC Gamer：關於昨天開幕式開始時你所發表的談話，你提到：「暴雪確保每個人表達自己立場的權利，無論是透過哪些方式或在哪些地方表達。」接著你也承諾未來會更妥善處理類似情形，並將不是以紙上空談的形式，也將以實際行動證明。所以你是否會調整針對香港選手Blitzchung和兩位台灣主播賽評的懲處？
J. Allen Brack：我們並不會重新調整懲處。
PC Gamer： 為什麼？
J. Allen Brack：我們之所以在開幕式的談話中提到我們確保每個人透過不同方式在不同地方表達自己立場的權利，是因為我們深信言論自由，同時深信每個人有表達意見的權利。長期以來，這項觀念也融入在公司企業與員工文化中。我們也堅信這是我們想與玩家社群共同分享的文化。因此，員工可以自由在私人的社群媒體帳號發表自己的意見與看法。我們的電競選手、大師職業賽選手、或是任何與電競領域相關的人，他們都能夠在自己私人的社群媒體帳號中自由表達自己的意見或做任何他們想做的事情。傳統運動產業在聚焦每個觀點後，就會確保所有人員都能夠遵守。相較於傳統運動來說，我認為我們在電競上針對此領域有更開放的指導準則跟政策。以上是我們對於自由表達意見權利的想法，以及一些背景的說明。
官方轉播頻道的內容通常佔所有我們產製內容的很小一部分，但我們希望它能夠與遊戲或賽事相關，並聚焦在遊戲或賽事內容。再次說明，這與Blitzchung所表達的訊息內容無關，而是因為這訊息與遊戲或賽事並沒有關聯。如果我們沒有採取對應的行動，或是我們沒有應對，你可以想像未來賽事訪問時可能會發生的各種情形。這些時段可能被用來陳述任何他們想做的事或是議題。這不是我們樂見的，我們真的想讓這些官方轉播頻道上的內容能夠聚焦在遊戲與賽事本身。
PC Gamer：以暴雪的立場是，你們希望玩家能夠擁有自由表達意見的權利，但是在官方轉播頻道以外的地方嗎？
J. Allen Brack： 沒錯
PC Gamer：那我是否可以說，如果Blitzchung表達了任何政治立場的訊息，也會受到同樣的懲處嗎？這並不是因為他特別提到並呼籲了香港自由，而是他表達了政治性的言論嗎？
J. Allen Brack：沒錯，訊息內容本身不是問題所在。事實上，是因為那些問題與賽事本身無關，兩者間有很大的不同。我並不想推測他如果當初說了這個、說了那個，事情會如何發展，這是一件困難的事情，但這一切與他所表達的訊息內容並沒有關係。有很多人是支持他和他所傳遞的訊息的。
PC Gamer：有一件事我很好奇，但大眾並沒有廣為討論的，是兩位台灣的主播賽評以及他們在整個事件中的角色，我想進一步了解他們的懲處。其中一位賽評主動聯繫我，他們對於事情的發展感到相當沮喪。他們並不認為自己應該因為Blitzchung想表達的訊息而被處罰。我想了解亞太區的賽評或是任何暴雪電競賽事的賽評，是否受過賽事轉播期間特殊情況處理所進行的特別訓練？
J. Allen Brack：我們和不同的賽評主播有著不同程度的合作歷史與合作關係。我們的目標一直很清楚，是讓賽事轉播持續進行並聚焦在遊戲或是賽事上。針對兩位台灣賽評以及他們是否與Blitzchung涉入（此起事件）等都有不同解讀，但這並不是我們考量的因素。我們考量的是，他們是受暴雪聘請來執行一項工作，讓賽事轉播聚焦在該被聚焦的東西上。在這次事件中，他們工作是確保轉播能夠聚焦在賽事、在獲勝選手以及在奪冠路程中的故事。他們並沒有成功地完成他們的工作，這是我們針對兩位賽評做出決定的原因。
PC Gamer：一直流傳著一個猜測是中國和你們在中國的業務影響了對於此事件的裁定以及你們的聲明。能否請你公開確認網易或是任何一個你們在中國的夥伴，在此事件中的裁決過程中並沒有任何影響？
J. Allen Brack：我很開心你問了這個問題，因為我想非常清楚地說明。第一件事情我想特別說明的是，有很大量令人混淆的資訊和對於中國規範的不甚了解。就法律層面而言，暴雪並不被允許在中國營運或發行任何遊戲，你必須要有一個夥伴。這是當地的規範和法律。網易是我們的夥伴，網易並不是政府機構，網易是一家公司，是我們在中國的發行商。在整個事件中有一個事情被討論的是暴雪（爐石戰記）微博發文和文章內的用詞。我們於法並不被允許直接經營或營運這些頻道，這是我們在中國的發行商網易的決定。
網易是否參與在此事件中的討論當中？當然他們有參與其中，同時台灣暴雪辦公室、爐石戰記領導團隊和爐石電競團隊等單位都參與其中，如同我所說的，我們行動的太快也太倉促。這整件事情錯誤的部分是當這些單位聚集起來後，在非常短的時間內決定了什麼是合適且該採取的行為。
PC Gamer：所以那篇微博發文中，提到 「同時，我們也將一如既往地堅決維護國家尊嚴」是由網易所寫的嗎？
J. Allen Brack：是的，我們並沒有授權此貼文，我們也沒有核准此貼文。就算他們提出要求，我們也不會核准此貼文。

PC Gamer：至於兩位賽評，你也以暴雪的立場承認有做錯以及失誤的地方。我很好奇為什麼這些寬容並未適用在兩位賽評身上？考量暴雪承認在此次事件上的處理有所失誤，為什麼不寬容兩位賽評以及降輕兩位賽評的處分？
J. Allen Brack：有的，針對兩位賽評我們是有較寬容處理的。最初的裁決是我們將中止與兩位賽評合作。經過重新審視後，我們認為針對Blitzchung以及兩位賽評的裁決應該盡可能一致，我們也調整裁決為暫停合作六個月。

President Blizzard talks about the incident of Cong Ge: disapproval and no authorization for NetEase to ""maintain the dignity of the country""
03 Nov 2019, 07:13 by Yang Zhengxun, Yang Zhengxun

Blizzard President J. Allen Brack apologized for the ""Cong Brothers Incident"" at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Blizzard Carnival (2019BlizzCon), confessing that ""the decision was made too quickly when the incident was handled, and the communication with the player was too slow"" Expressed willingness to accept accusations from outside. However, netizens reacted to the two poles. The netizens who did not buy the account thought that he was too vague and still did not recover the punishment. Now J. Allen Brack also talked about his talk at the opening ceremony in the latest interview with foreign media PC Gamer. Explain why the punishment is not recovered.


In addition, he also mentioned that after the Congge incident, Blizzard’s Chinese publisher NetEase released the post “At the same time, we will continue to resolutely safeguard the national dignity” on the Hearthstone Weibo. It was not authorized and approved by Blizzard. And even if Netease makes a request, Blizzard will not approve it.

The following is an interview with PC Gamer and J. Allen Brack:
PC Gamer: Regarding the conversation you made at the beginning of the opening ceremony yesterday, you mentioned: ""Blizzard ensures everyone's right to express their position, no matter in which way or in what place."" Then you promise that the future will be better. Dealing with similar situations will not be in the form of paper talks, but will also be proved by practical actions. So, will you adjust the punishment for Hong Kong player Blitzchung and two Taiwanese anchors?
J. Allen Brack: We will not re-adjust the punishment.
PC Gamer: Why?
J. Allen Brack: We mentioned in the opening speech that we have the right to ensure that everyone can express their position in different places in different ways because we are convinced of freedom of speech and believe that everyone has the right to express their opinions. For a long time, this concept has also been integrated into the company's corporate and employee culture. We also believe that this is the culture we want to share with the player community. Therefore, employees are free to express their opinions and opinions in private social media accounts. Our eSports players, master professional players, or anyone involved in the eSports field are free to express their opinions or do whatever they want in their private social media accounts. After focusing on each point of view, the traditional sports industry will ensure that all personnel can comply. Compared to traditional sports, I think we have more open guidelines and policies for this field in e-sports. These are our thoughts on the right to freely express opinions, as well as some background descriptions.
The content of the official broadcast channel usually accounts for a small portion of all our production content, but we want it to be relevant to the game or event and focus on the game or event content. Again, this has nothing to do with the content of the message expressed by Blitzchung, but because it is not related to the game or event. If we don't take the corresponding action, or if we don't respond, you can imagine the various situations that might happen in future events. These periods may be used to state anything they want to do or issues. This is not something we are happy to see. We really want the content on these official broadcast channels to focus on the game and the event itself.
PC Gamer: According to Blizzard's position, you want players to have the right to express their opinions freely, but outside the official broadcast channel?
J. Allen Brack: That's right.
PC Gamer: Can I say that if Blitzchung expresses any political position, will it be punished equally? This is not because he specifically mentioned and appealed to Hong Kong's freedom, but did he express political remarks?
J. Allen Brack: Yes, the message itself is not the problem. In fact, it is because those issues are not related to the event itself, and there is a big difference between the two. I don't want to speculate that if he said this and said that, how things will develop, this is a difficult thing, but it has nothing to do with the content of the message he expressed. There are many people who support him and the messages he delivers.
PC Gamer: One thing I was curious about, but the public did not discuss it extensively. It was the two Taiwanese anchor reviews and their role in the whole incident. I want to know more about their punishment. One of the contestants contacted me and they were quite frustrated with the development of the matter. They don't think they should be punished for what Blitzchung wants to say. I would like to know if the Asia-Pacific competition or any Blizzard competition is a special training for special situations during the broadcast.
J. Allen Brack: We have different levels of cooperation history and cooperation with different game anchors. Our goal has always been clear, to keep the event broadcast and focus on the game or event. There are different interpretations of the two Taiwanese reviews and whether they are involved in Blitzchung (this incident), but this is not a factor we consider. What we are considering is that they were hired by Blizzard to perform a job to focus on the focus of the event. In this incident, their job is to ensure that the broadcast can focus on the event, the winner and the story of the championship. They did not successfully complete their work, which is why we made a decision on the two reviews.
PC Gamer: There has been a speculation that China and your business in China have affected the ruling on this incident and your statement. Can you please confirm that Netease or any of your partners in China have no influence in the ruling process in this incident?
J. Allen Brack: I am very happy that you asked this question because I want to explain it very clearly. The first thing I want to make special is that there is a lot of confusing information and a lack of understanding of Chinese norms. At the legal level, Blizzard is not allowed to operate or distribute any games in China, you must have a partner. This is the local norms and laws. Netease is our partner, Netease is not a government agency, NetEase is a company and our publisher in China. One thing that was discussed throughout the incident was the words published in Blizzard (Hestone Wars) Weibo and articles. We are not allowed to operate or operate these channels directly, which is the decision of our publisher in China, NetEase.
Does NetEase participate in the discussion in this incident? Of course, they are involved, and Taiwan’s Blizzard Office, Hearthstone Wars Leadership Team and Hearthstone E-sports team are all involved. As I said, we act too fast and too hasty. The whole part of this whole thing is that when these units get together, they decide what is appropriate and what to do in a very short time.
PC Gamer: So in the Weibo post, I mentioned, ""At the same time, we will, as always, resolutely safeguard the dignity of the country."" Was it written by NetEase?
J. Allen Brack: Yes, we did not authorize this post and we have not approved this post. We will not approve this post even if they request it.

PC Gamer: As for the two reviews, you also acknowledged the mistakes and mistakes in Blizzard's position. I am curious why these tolerances are not applicable to the two competitions? Considering Blizzard's acknowledgment of the mistakes in the handling of this incident, why not tolerate the two evaluations and the two disciplinary actions?
J. Allen Brack: Yes, we are more tolerant of the two reviews. The initial ruling was that we will suspend cooperation with the two competitions. After a re-examination, we believe that the rulings against Blitzchung and the two competitions should be as consistent as possible, and we have also adjusted the ruling to suspend cooperation for six months.
