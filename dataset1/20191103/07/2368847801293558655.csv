娛樂筆記：電影《花椒之味》透視的人生況味

03 Nov 2019, 07:49

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】主演新片《花椒之味》的香港藝人鄭秀文（Sammi），日前在社交平台透露，年邁的父母近期都出現身體問題。當「生蛇」（帶狀皰疹）的媽媽正在接受治療的時候，父親的身體又開始抱恙。她遺憾的是，儘管新片日前還在公映，但父母這回再不能像以往那樣去戲院看她的電影。
鄭秀文在facebook寫道：「想起父母以往總是身體力行去支持我這個女兒，我深深感受到父母已踏進了另一個更年老的階段。《花椒之味》說的是親情，『如樹』這個大女兒角色提醒我，趁一切還在，好好珍惜。」「生命老病死看似很悲哀，但只要好好去愛，就起碼不會有遺憾。心中有愛，就會微笑。」
親情是人類情感中最複雜的一種，親人也是最難和解卻最容易原諒的矛盾體。電影《花椒之味》改編自香港作家張小嫻多年前出版的小說《我的愛如此麻辣》，描繪的就是讓人都很有共鳴的親情。
影片講述，一個看似不負責任的父親，在年輕時經歷了三段感情，並留下了三個女兒。因為自責和不想女兒們彼此影響，他選擇了一直隱瞞事實真相。因此三個女兒各自在自己的城市生活，她們渴望著父愛但又缺失父愛。
而這一切在這位父親去世後得到了改變。
有一天，在旅行社工作的夏如樹（鄭秀文飾）突然收到父親夏亮（鍾鎮濤飾）的去世的噩耗時，卻發現原來自己在台北、重慶兩地各有一個同父異母的妹妹歐陽如枝（賴雅妍飾）及夏如果（李曉峰 飾）。
來自不同地域的三姐妹在父親葬禮上首次碰面，明明陌生，卻有著血緣的牽絆，也同樣面對著父母離異的創傷與對生活的徬徨。
本片主線雖在鄭秀文飾演的大姐「如樹」與父親的關係，但也有老二「如枝」和再婚母親的爭執，以及不被母親承認的老三「如果」與外婆間的親情。三組人物關係雖有不同表現手法，卻都在講難以向至親說真話的問題。
終於，性格迥異的三姐妹在共同回憶父親的道路上走在了一起。「如樹」毅然決定，帶著兩個妹妹繼續經營父親留下的火鍋店。她們在忙碌的歲月裡，重新認識了父親的另一面。在破碎家庭中成長的三姊妹，也因此認識了親情，認識了身邊的人，療癒了成長的傷口。
片中的演員群整體表現不俗，其中洗淨鉛華的鄭秀文戲分吃重，演技精湛。電影中有不少針對人生的金句，例如火鍋店員工對「如樹」說：「每個人都會犯錯，大家都在等一個原諒自己的人。」就像在觀照「如樹」與父親的關係。
花椒，常用調味輔料之一，味麻、味辣、味澀，刺激性強，初次接觸很難適應，但有著溫中行氣、逐寒、止痛、殺蟲等功效。《花椒之味》中講述的是人與人之間的親情故事，卻以「花椒」來命名，強調的就是花椒帶給人的那種複雜又深刻的感受。電影中的「花椒」至少具有三層含義：
首先，明指的是「父親」火鍋店裡的實物花椒。因為三姐妹對父親的主要追憶是在火鍋店完成，而火鍋店裡最大的特色就是那大大小小放滿各地的花椒。三個女兒在充滿了花椒氣息的店鋪裡研究著父親火鍋底料的配方，回想著父親曾在這裡說過的話、做過的事，把對父親的思念寄託在了花椒之中。
其次，代指的是父親的愛。花椒的味道是用一種痛去掩蓋另一種痛，看似是痛，其實也是愛。父親對女兒們充滿了關愛，卻有著自己難以言傳的苦衷，只能選擇遠遠地躲在一邊，默默地關注著她們的成長，關心著她們的生活，害怕自己再給女兒們帶來傷害，這位父親就像一罐把自己鎖在玻璃瓶子裡的花椒。
此外，片名還透視出，生活中的人就像一顆花椒，很多人內心火熱但表面充滿了倔強，固守著自己的情緒與執著，卻不懂得與人好好相處，明明是愛到頭來卻變成了誤會。大姐「如樹」與父親和前男友是這樣，二姐「如枝」與自己的母親是這樣，三妹與自己的婆婆也是這樣。
當一個人經歷太多之後，最回味的還是一家人團圓相聚時的溫暖。這或許就是《花椒之味》要以「花椒」來命名的原因。花椒之味，五味雜陳，但回味無窮。人生的成長，親情，愛情都像食一顆花椒，會有陣痛，會有灼烈，會有麻木，但最後的味道是溫暖。
人生如果一直甘之如飴，可能不會有太過深刻的感受。人生就是充滿荊棘和坎坷，對於鄭秀文來說也是如此。她曾是香港最受歡迎女歌手，最有號召力的女藝人。她在自己演藝生涯的高峰時曾身患疾病隱退多年，在愛情上，她既經歷了甜蜜，也經歷了丈夫的背叛。
現在的鄭秀文依然積極樂觀地生活著，面對父母年邁體衰，她孝順地說：「我並不會陷入悲觀，生命本是不斷地經歷和學習，身體壯的照顧身體弱的，年壯的就保護老弱。生命就是如此在愛和磨練中生生不息。父母一直無條件地去養育和愛護子女，現在父母老了，需要我們，我們就要盡全心去照顧父母。」

Entertainment Notes: The Life of the Movie ""The Flavor of Pepper""

03 Nov 2019, 07:49

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Sammi, the Hong Kong artist who starred in the new film ""The Flavor of Pepper"", revealed on the social platform that elderly parents have recently had physical problems. When the mother of the ""snake"" (shingles) is being treated, the father's body begins to hold on again. She regrets that although the new film is still being released, the parents can no longer go to the theater to watch her movie.
Zheng Xiuwen wrote on Facebook: ""I remembered that my parents used to support my daughter. I deeply felt that my parents have stepped into another stage of ageing. ""The taste of pepper"" is about family, ""like a tree."" ""This big daughter role reminds me that everything is still there, and I cherish it."" ""Life seems to be very sad, but as long as you love it, there will be at least no regrets. If you have love in your heart, you will smile.""
Family ties are the most complicated kind of human emotions, and loved ones are also the most difficult contradictions but the most easily forgiven contradictions. The film ""The Flavor of Pepper"" was adapted from the novel ""My Love is So Spicy"" published by Hong Kong writer Zhang Xiaoyu many years ago. It depicts the family that people are very resonating.
The film tells that a seemingly irresponsible father experienced three emotions at a young age and left three daughters. Because of self-blame and not wanting daughters to influence each other, he chose to keep the truth. So the three daughters each lived in their own city, they longed for the father's love but lacked the father's love.
And all this changed after the death of this father.
One day, Xia Rushu (Zheng Xiuwen), who worked in a travel agency, suddenly received the loss of his father Xia Liang (Zhong Zhentao), but found that he had a half-sister, Ouyang Ru, in Taipei and Chongqing. Branch (Lai Yazhen) and Xia if (Li Xiaofeng).
The three sisters from different regions met for the first time at the father's funeral. They were unfamiliar, but they were bloody, and they also faced the trauma of their parents and the embarrassment of life.
Although the main line of this film is in the relationship between the big sister ""Rushu"" played by Sammi Cheng and his father, there is also a dispute between the second child ""Ruzhi"" and the remarried mother, and the relationship between the third child ""if"" and the grandmother who are not recognized by the mother. Although the three groups of characters have different expressions, they are all talking about the difficulty of telling the truth to the next.
Finally, the three sisters with different personalities walked together on the road to recall their father. ""Rushu"" decided to take the two sisters to continue to run the hot pot shop left by his father. In the busy years, they re-recognized the other side of their father. The three sisters who grew up in the broken family also met their family, met the people around them, and healed the growing wounds.
The actor group in the film performed well overall, among which Zheng Xiuwen, who cleaned the lead, played heavily and performed well. There are many golden sentences in life in the movie. For example, the staff of the hot pot restaurant said to ""Rushu"": ""Everyone will make mistakes, everyone is waiting for someone who forgives himself."" It is like watching ""Rushu"" and his father. relationship.
Pepper, one of the commonly used seasoning accessories, taste, spicy, miso, strong, irritating, difficult to adapt to the first contact, but has the effect of warming, cold, pain, insecticide and so on. The flavor of pepper is about the family story between people, but it is named after ""Pepper"", which emphasizes the complex and profound feeling that pepper brings to people. The ""Prickly Pear"" in the movie has at least three meanings:
First of all, Ming refers to the actual pepper in the ""father"" hot pot restaurant. Because the main memory of the three sisters to the father is done in the hot pot restaurant, and the biggest feature of the hot pot restaurant is the large and small peppers. The three daughters studied the formula of the father's hot pot base in a shop filled with pepper, recalling what the father had said and done, and pinning his father's thoughts on the pepper.
Second, the generation refers to the father's love. The taste of pepper is to cover up another kind of pain with a kind of pain. It seems to be pain, but it is also love. My father is full of love for his daughters, but he has his own unspeakable hardships. He can only choose to stay away from the side, silently pay attention to their growth, care about their lives, and fear that they will bring harm to their daughters. The father is like a can of pepper that locks himself in a glass jar.
In addition, the title also reveals that people in life are like a pepper, many people are hot inside but the surface is full of stubbornness, sticking to their emotions and persistence, but they don’t know how to get along well with others, obviously they love it and become Misunderstanding. The older sister ""Rushu"" is like this with her father and ex-boyfriend. The second sister is like ""the mother"" and her mother. This is also true of the three sisters and their mother-in-law.
When a person experiences too much, the most memorable thing is the warmth of a family gathering together. This may be why the ""flavor of pepper"" is named after ""Pepper."" The taste of pepper is mixed with five flavors, but the aftertaste is endless. The growth of life, affection, love is like eating a pepper, there will be pain, there will be burning, there will be numbness, but the final taste is warm.
If life has always been ruthless, there may not be too deep feelings. Life is full of thorns and bumps, and so is Zheng Xiuwen. She was once the most popular female singer in Hong Kong and the most charismatic female artist. She had suffered from illness for many years at the peak of her acting career. In love, she experienced both sweetness and her husband's betrayal.
Zheng Xiuwen is still living with optimism. In the face of her parents' aging and decline, she said filially: ""I will not fall into pessimism. Life is constantly experienced and learned. The body is strong and takes care of the weak, strong. Protecting the old and the weak. Life is so in love and tempering. Parents have been unconditionally raising and caring for their children. Now that their parents are old and need us, we must do our best to take care of our parents.""
