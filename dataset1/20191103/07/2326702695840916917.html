      <p>I have to admit that since the release of <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> Modern Warfare last month, the game has successfully been able to drag me back into the franchise for the first time in 10 years. Not that I’m complaining.</p>
      <p>While playing with friends (both on <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/pc">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/console">console</a>) has been a genuinely fun experience, what has perhaps surprised me the most (particularly in this modern gaming world) is that this launched in a very solid state. Yes, there are problems, but truthfully not many of them.</p>
      <p>If you are, however, planning on jumping in for some Call of Duty action on your PC today, then you might want to get your <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/blizzard">Battle.net</a> launcher open now. A huge 8GB patch has arrived to look to fix some of the little problems lurking within Call of Duty Modern Warfare.</p>

      <h3>What Do We Think?</h3>
      <p>Having tried the patch, there are definite improvements in the overall feel of the game. Particularly to the aforementioned ‘footsteps’ which I did notice as a problem myself. Admittedly, there are still a few issues lurking within the game. As above, however, I can’t stress enough just how surprisingly good this game has been since its release.</p>
      <p>If you are, therefore, sitting on the fence with this one, I can thoroughly recommend it and, despite the huge size of this 8GB patch making it appear that this was (or is) a bit of a mess, it honestly really isn’t!</p>
