香港電台取消「42屆十大中文金曲」頒獎禮

03 Nov 2019, 07:46

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】香港電台11月1日宣布，將取消「第42屆十大中文金曲」頒獎典禮及音樂會。港台說明取消的理由是，因近月社會氣氛的影響，電台慮及歌手和樂迷等參與公眾活動時的安全。據港媒報導，這是該項活動42年來首次停辦。
香港電台週五（11月1日）向媒體廣發通告：「因為近月社會氣氛及港台重視歌手、樂迷等參與公眾活動時的安全，今年決定暫停『第42屆十大中文金曲』的頒獎禮和音樂會。」
通告還表示，雖然取消了頒獎禮和音樂會，但會改為製作跨媒體特備節目，安排於2020年1月下旬通過港台電視31、香港電台第二台及香港電台網站播出，以此總結香港樂壇2019年的成績及宣布所有獎項。
據香港蘋果日報報導，「香港電台」總監周國豐受訪時表示，「大約在兩個多星期前有這樣一個決定，原因同新聞稿寫的一樣，但除了社會氣氛，港台作為一間公營電台，必須保障入場所有人士的安全。之前與所有唱片公司都進行過溝通。」
今年的「十大中文金曲」頒奬禮及音樂會，原計劃分別於12月13日、2020年1月13日在九龍灣的Star Hall、香港中文大學的球場舉行，但現在改成節目形式舉辦，周國豐表示：「雖然今年沒有頒奬禮，但往年的投票機制沒變，投票期是11月2日2點至11月10日，樂迷可以登入港台網上專頁投票。」
至於今年「金針獎」的得主，周國豐指今年「金針獎」將從缺，但沒說明原因。
一年一度的「十大中文金曲」的評選始於1978年，旨在推動華中文流行音樂。活動由香港電台主辦，香港作曲家及作詞家協會、國際唱片協會、香港唱片商會協辦。
去年舉行的「第41屆十大中文金曲」頒獎大會，是繼第30屆和第40屆之後，第三次將活動整體拆分為頒獎禮和紀念音樂會兩個部分，即首先於2018年12月17日假香港知專設計學院舉行頒獎禮，並頒發大部分獎項，其後於2019年1月3日晚，假九龍灣國際展貿中心舉行紀念音樂會及頒發餘下的獎項。
