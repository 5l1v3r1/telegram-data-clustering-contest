四川法輪功學員潘曉萍遭藥物迫害致瘋

03 Nov 2019, 07:04

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】四川省什邡市法輪功學員潘曉萍，因堅持「真、善、忍」信仰，多次遭綁架、非法關押、勞教，於2015年被非法判刑3年。在獄中，潘曉萍遭到各種酷刑折磨，後被藥物迫害致瘋。
明慧網報導，潘曉萍在修煉前，曾患多種疾病，有胃出血、頭痛、心跳不正常、鼻咽癌等，當時38歲的她活得痛苦不堪。
2006年初，潘曉萍開始修煉法輪功，身心受益，多種疾病很快痊癒，並且從一個悲觀者變成樂觀、開朗之人。
2008年7月8日，潘曉萍在街上講法輪功真相時，被綁架、非法拘留了15天。
2009年，她在家裡聽語音版的《九評共產黨》，遭人惡告後，什邡市公安局國保大隊警察闖到她家。她及時走脫後，被迫離家出走，隨後在成都市青白江區打工，後被綁架、非法拘留15天。
2011年6月，什邡市「610辦公室」（專門迫害法輪功的非法機構）主任李某、城東派出所警察和廣漢和興洗腦班人員五六個人，闖到潘曉萍打工的飯館，把她綁架到位於廣漢市和興鎮的德陽市「610」洗腦班，迫害了39天。潘曉萍始終不配合、「不轉化」（放棄修煉）。
從洗腦班回家後，為了謀生，潘曉萍租了一輛三輪車來跑客運。2011年12月21日，德陽市「610」安排一個人來坐她的車，誘騙她給那人講法輪功真相，以此為所謂的「證據」綁架了她，非法拘留她15天。
隨後潘曉萍被劫持到四川省資中楠木寺女子勞教所非法勞教1年。期間，她遭毆打、罰站、長期坐小板凳等。

2015年7月2日，潘曉萍發法輪功真相光碟時，被綁架到什邡市拘留所。她不穿號服、不報數，遭警察毆打。在拘留所被非法關押了十多天後，她被劫持到什邡市看守所。
潘曉萍絕食反迫害，被看守所灌食，她不配合，牙被撬出血來。獄警用鐵鏈子把她鎖住，致使她只能彎著腰走路；獄警還慫恿室內的在押犯打她、罵她，把她的褲子脫掉，只剩內褲，拿鞋底子蘸上水打她的臀部。
2015年9月16日下午，什邡法院與檢察院合謀，對潘曉萍非法判刑3年，於11月11日把她劫持到四川女子監獄（龍泉驛女子監獄）。
在監獄二監區，潘曉萍每天遭洗腦迫害，被強迫看誹謗法輪功的宣傳片。獄警看她不「轉化」，每天晚上12點鐘才准她睡覺，並指使值班的犯人每隔半小時叫醒她一次；並不准她洗臉、洗腳、洗澡，不讓上超市購買生活必需品。
在兩年多的時間裡，獄警對她實施了不讓睡覺、冷凍、澆涼水、溺水——把人頭按進涼水桶裡、坐小板凳、電棍電擊、面壁罰站、吊銬在床柱上、灌食等迫害。

他們為了不讓潘曉萍煉功，就用筷子綁在她的手彎上和腳彎上，認為這樣就可以制止她煉功。她還是煉，把筷子都折斷了；獄警就又給她穿上「約束衣」、不讓上廁所、把她關進嚴管組。
後來獄警乾脆誣衊潘曉萍是「精神病」，強制給她灌「治」精神病的藥，在潘曉萍回家前的兩個月開始給她灌藥，有時隔一天灌一次，有時每天都灌。監獄具體給她灌了多少次，她已記不清了，一直到她出獄前一天還在給她灌藥。
自灌藥後，潘曉萍身體出現了不正常狀態，出現牙痛、身體僵硬、走路時腳痛、聽力下降、頭部出現很多風癬、心慌意亂。包夾（看管法輪功學員的刑事犯）說：「灌藥後還會出現手、腳發軟的症狀。」
潘曉萍出獄幾個月後，大約2019年10月初，出現了更為嚴重的精神失常的現象，她丈夫只好把她反鎖在家裡，才能出門幹活。
據悉，什邡市城東派出所警察於2019年10月18日把潘曉萍送到什邡市精神病醫院。#
