王渝屏以《你的孩子不是你的孩子---貓的孩子》單元入圍本屆金鐘新人獎，而她主演的《鏡文學驚悚劇場---完美Lily》也令人驚豔，她的演技狂放與她的感性十分契合，談起戀愛她也敢愛敢恨，王渝屏說：「一定要相信愛情啊，不然還有什麼可以相信的呢？」




王渝屏小檔案

生日 1994.10.8
身高168公分，體重45公斤
愛吃麵食類
愛運動，BMI值18以下。


另一方面天秤座的王渝屏，覺得人生很重要的，是一定要保持獨立思考狀態，無論碰到這輩子的大小事，都要一直這樣，隨時能停下來，想一想。


談起戀愛王渝屏敢愛敢恨，她說：「一定要相信愛情啊，不然還有什麼可以相信的呢？」

在時尚表演上，王渝屏很常以獨特妝容表情吸睛，和她的戲劇演出一樣，令人想多看幾眼；但在北藝大讀表演系時，她並不想學以致用。「當時我喜歡電影，但一直沒辦法enjoy到表演裡面，因為無法放鬆。」王渝屏讀書時接觸到許多不同國家、不同派系的老師，一下子要吸收、呈現，她覺得自己做不太到。
「當時我想將來可能要做平庸的規畫了。那時候的指導老師是陳湘琪、徐華謙，他們是很高標準的，我覺得表演好像是為了取悅老師，或為了讓老師給你很高分，這的確給我很大壓力。」
後來拍拍廣告、當模特兒賺零用錢，王渝屏覺得有趣、放鬆，海選《貓的孩子》時，她想說人很多、反正選不上，就反而放很開，說了很多想法，沒想到反而打動導演，後來甚至為她把角色從男生改成女生。這部戲讓王渝屏開始懂得演戲的樂趣。

「我不會說自己超愛表演，畢竟常常拍戲一整天，也只是重複做著幾個日常動作，可能端著一杯水走來走去，可是當你遇到好的劇組和對手，會有那麼靈光乍現的一兩秒，是你覺得從來都沒有過這樣的體驗，就這一兩秒，可以讓我撐很久很久。」王渝屏藉著表演和世界溝通，她的同學很多人都熱愛創作，想寫劇本、想當導演，她不想，她只想在有限的範圍內做無限的創作，比方說當演員這件事，就非常契合。
王渝屏和妹妹都非常獨立，姊妹倆似乎成了一派，會一起說父母的小話，比方說父母都是的巨蟹座好恐怖喔之類的。關於巨蟹座很愛家的說法，姊妹倆的解釋是：「他們愛的是他倆的家啊，他們一直過自己的生活，感情一直很好，還會一直放閃。」每次接受訪問，大家都對姊妹的父母興趣很高，王渝屏甚至以「drama queen」形容母親對待她們的樣貌，但是父母的教養方式，反而讓她和妹妹王渝萱天不怕地不怕的，加上很早就接觸歐美新浪潮電影，兩人擁有自由自在的靈魂。

王渝屏說：「好像從小到大都有一個憨膽，做事常常也沒多想，就覺得先做了再說。」她是一個耐得住孤獨的人，在未成年時獨自去了尼泊爾爬山和英國旅遊，讓她藉著移動，看見許多美好的事物，她不是抱著玩的念頭，而是去體驗人生。
「我在尼泊爾的每天都印象深刻，每天都睡在玉米倉庫裡，長達一個多星期沒洗澡，每天都在吃咖哩，穿上華美的傳統服飾Saree，在古老的寺廟上看到許多栩栩如生的性愛雕刻，這對當時年僅16歲的我都是很巨大的文化衝擊。」
對王渝屏而言，生活應該有很多的餘韻，工作也和生活密不可分，藉工作旅遊各地，也體驗生活，她希望自己時而理性、時而感性，讓人生更為精彩。

[Mrs. Lan Lan's meeting room 2] Chen Xiangqi's high standard makes her want to give up Wang Shuping relies on her timid experience
03 Nov 2019, 23:09 by Wang Yalan, Xiao Zhijie
Wang Yuping was shortlisted for the Golden Bell Newcomer Award for ""Your Child Is Not Your Child---Children of Cats"", and her ""Mirror Literature Thriller Theater---Perfect Lily"" is also amazing. Her acting is wild. She is very close to her sensibility. When she talks about love, she dares to love and hate. Wang Yuping said: ""Be sure to believe in love, or what else can you believe?""

On the other hand, Wang Liping of Libra thinks that life is very important. It is necessary to maintain a state of independent thinking. No matter how big or small it is in this life, you must always do this. You can stop at any time and think about it.


When talking about love, Wang Shuping dare to love and hate, she said: ""Be sure to believe in love, or what else can you believe?""

In the fashion show, Wang Shuping often wears a unique look and looks like a drama. It is like her drama, and she wants to see more. But when she was reading the performance department at Beiyi University, she didn't want to use it. ""At the time, I liked movies, but I couldn't have been invited to the show because I couldn't relax."" When Wang Shuping was reading, he was exposed to many teachers from different countries and different factions. He wanted to absorb and present at once. She felt that she could not do it.
""At the time, I thought I might have to make mediocre plans in the future. At that time, the instructors were Chen Xiangqi and Xu Huaqian. They are very high standards. I think the performance seems to be to please the teacher, or to give the teacher a high score. This really puts a lot of pressure on me.""
Later, when I patted advertisements and used models to make pocket money, Wang Yiping felt interesting and relaxed. When she chose ""Children of Cats"", she wanted to say that there were many people, and she couldn’t choose anyway. Instead, she opened it very much and said a lot of ideas. I thought of moving the director instead, and later changed her role from a boy to a girl. This play made Wang Shuping begin to understand the fun of acting.

""I don't want to say that I love performances. After all, I often take pictures all day. I just repeat a few daily actions. I may walk around with a glass of water, but when you meet a good crew and opponents, there will be Then, for a second or two seconds, you feel that you have never had such an experience. In these two seconds, you can keep me for a long time."" Wang Yuping communicated with the world through performances, and many of her classmates loved creating. I want to write a script and want to be a director. She doesn't want to. She just wants to make unlimited creations within a limited scope. For example, when she is an actor, it fits very well.
Wang Yuping and his sister are very independent. The sisters seem to be a group. They will talk about their parents' words, such as the fact that their parents are Cancer. Regarding Cancer’s love of home, the sister’s explanation is: “They love their home. They have been living their lives, their feelings have been good, and they have been flashing.” Every time I accept the interview, everyone They are very interested in the sisters' parents. Wang Shuping even described the mother as a ""drama queen"", but the parent's parenting style made her and her sister Wang Haotian not afraid of it, and contacted Europe and the United States very early. In the tide movie, the two have a free soul.

Wang Yuping said: ""It seems that there is a daring from small to large, and often do not think about things. I feel that I have to do it first."" She is a person who can stand the loneliness and went to Nepal to climb mountains and travel to the UK alone. Let her see many beautiful things by moving. She is not holding the thought of playing, but going to experience life.
""I am very impressed every day in Nepal. I sleep in a corn warehouse every day. I haven’t taken a bath for more than a week. I eat curry every day, wear colorful traditional costumes, Saree, and see many vivid life in ancient temples. Sex carving, which was a huge cultural shock for me at the age of 16.""
For Wang Yuping, life should have a lot of aftertaste, and work is inseparable from life. Through work and travel, I also experience life. She hopes that she can be rational and sometimes emotional, which makes people more exciting.
