Kilcoo (Down) 1-11 - 0-9 Magherafelt (Derry)
A Jerome Johnston goal proved crucial as Kilcoo overcame the stubborn resistance of Magherafelt in yesterday’s Ulster Club SFC quarter-final at Páirc Esler.
The hosts started brightly with scores from Aaron and Daryl Branagan before Emmett McGuckin gave his side a foothold.
However Kilcoo’s hard work was rewarded with future scores include a Paul Devlin free which edged them to a 0-5 to 0-4 interval lead.
Johnston’s 37-minute goal increased that advantage but Magherafelt refused to throw in the towel.
