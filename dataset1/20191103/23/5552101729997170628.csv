03 Nov 2019, 23:57 by 蔡世偉
衛視中文台《一袋女王》日前邀請陳子玄、陳建隆、陳子玄爸爸、陳櫻文、大夫、陳櫻文媽媽、依依、史丹利、依依媽媽三對夫妻檔與爸媽上節目，談岳父母怎麼看女婿話題。陳子玄笑說自己跟老公陳建隆差14歲，老公跟爸爸也恰好相差14歲，三個人等於是三代同堂的概念。
陳子玄爸爸說女兒交往的歷任男朋友都是他自己不經意發現，唯一一個說要介紹讓他認識的男朋友就是陳建隆。對於陳子玄怎麼會「找一個中年人來當男友」，陳爸爸坦言至今還是充滿疑惑。
而陳建隆長的像岳父這件事，連陳媽媽都認證通過，笑說陳子玄選擇陳建隆是不是有戀父情結，讓陳子玄接話笑說好像真的有，她說媽媽曾經問她要嫁給怎麼樣的男人，她當時就回說：「我要嫁給跟我爸一樣的男人！」
陳爸爸說當初陳子玄在講這些話的時候，他就在旁邊，聽到時他心裡是高興的，可是後來看到女婿時卻是難過，讓全場笑翻。陳爸爸緊接著說，其實他的心情很錯綜複雜，就是一開始似曾相識，突然間心裡湧上心頭很難過，到後來變得很放心，因為發現自己是把女兒交給另外一個爸爸，讓陳建隆一聽也鬆了一口氣。

陳爸爸毫不客氣認為女兒結婚太早，認為女兒心智成熟比較慢，不是幼稚而已，根本是驕縱，但也自豪地說：「驕縱要有本事啊，我讓她驕縱啊！」超霸氣言論讓曾國城很是激賞。
倒是陳建隆委屈的說：「就是你讓她太驕縱了，我都要扛」，讓現場笑翻。陳建隆也提到，當初陳子玄跟他說很憧憬未來的家庭生活，但生了兒子後一切都變了，完全超乎陳子玄想像，陳子玄也接話說到那個未來可能是十年後的未來，她也坦承自己真的太早結婚了，其實有點遺憾。

Chen’s father is unceremonious that his daughter is getting too early to marry. She thinks that her daughter’s mental maturity is relatively slow. It’s not childish. It’s just arrogance, but she is proud to say: “I have to be proud of my arrogance. I’m arrogant!” Zeng Guocheng is very exciting.
Instead, Chen Jianlong said: ""You just make her too arrogant, I have to swear"", let the scene laugh.
