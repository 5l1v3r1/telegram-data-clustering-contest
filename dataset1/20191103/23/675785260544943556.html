      <h1>Mothercare 'plans to go into administration' with thousands of UK jobs at risk</h1>
      <h2>The company is now looking to fold its UK business and will concentrate on its profitable franchises abroad</h2>

      <p>Mothercare is making plans that could see its UK business go into administration, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>The move has put thousands of British high street jobs at risk as it becomes the latest retailer facing collapse.</p>
      <p>The listed company is in advanced talks with lenders about fresh refinancing, according to Sky News.</p>
      <p>But the radical restricting plans would not directly affect its publicly quoted parent company.</p>
      <p>Mothercare's UK business represents only a small part of its overall group sales and is now dominated by its franchising business outside the UK.</p>
      <p>Mothercare has been trying for several months to find a buyer for its UK business.</p>

      <p>It opened its first store in the UK in 1961 in Surrey which now comprises just 79 standalone outlets.</p>
      <p>The company has around 2,500 employees who are now facing redundancy.</p>
      <p>In recent times, Mothercare has transformed itself into an international franchising group and trades from 1,000 stores in about 50 countries.</p>
      <p>The struggling retailer, which fell to a £36.3million loss last year under a controversial company voluntary arrangement (CVA).</p>
      <p>The news comes just months after Mothercare sold off its Early Learning Centre arm to The Entertainer for £13.5million.</p>
      <p>Mothercare’s UK business has been unprofitable for more than a decade, which sparked a mass of closures last year.</p>
