      <p>(CNN) - The day has finally come. The sorely-missed Popeyes chicken sandwich<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/business/popeyes-chicken-sandwich/index.html"> is back </a>and people are acting ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Drive-thru lines are stretching into the streets, people are live-tweeting from their cars and chicken sandwich memes have hit what seems to be an all-time high.</p>
      <p>After launching in August, the Popeyes chicken sandwich flew out of the fryer and into people's mouths. That is, until the chain announced the sandwiches <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/27/business/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-sold-out-trnd/index.html">were sold out</a> "for now." For two months, fanatics have been wondering eagerly when it would return.</p>
      <p>To the relief of many, Popeyes announced last week that the hot-commodity sandwich would return November 3. For those who haven't connected the dots, that's a Sunday, the day their chicken sandwich rival Chick-fil-A is closed.</p>
      <p>All week, enthusiasts have been prepping for the day they would be able to reunite with their beloved sandwich.</p>
      <p>Sunday eventually arrived with Popeyes tweeting, "Y'all...it's back."</p>
      <p>The lines were so long, some compared it to the end times.</p>
      <p>Some joked they'd give up their day jobs to start scalping sandwiches.</p>
      <p>And let's all have a moment of silence for Popeye's employees today.</p>
      <p>"I hope everyone working at Popeyes gets a raise of bonus because whew," writer Saeed Jones tweeted.</p>
      <p>Luckily for them, Popeyes has no plan to end the sandwich's run.</p>
      <p>"We plan to offer it to our guests for a long time," a Popeye's representative<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/business/popeyes-chicken-sandwich/index.html"> told CNN</a>. "We are confident that we'll be able to meet the demand."</p>
