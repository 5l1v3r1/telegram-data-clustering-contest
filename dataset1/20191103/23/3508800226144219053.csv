五感體驗是門好生意：「殺風景」的台中中央公園，如何喚醒感官？
03 Nov 2019, 23:56 by 眼底城事


我們想讓你知道的是當臺中清翠園的設計團隊挖空心思，大量運用高科技，最終目的也只是為了喚醒人體最原始的底層感官，這是否意味著我們日常生活中的物件與個人感知之間，早已出現了一道鴻溝？

曾幾何時，「五感體驗」成了當今市面上最常見的行銷口號。眾多商品（從音樂專輯到夜間市集）都不難發現類似的廣告。在今天訊息爆炸、眼球經濟主導的消費語境下，為何「感官體驗」這種行銷手法卻能歷久不衰？也許正因為我們處在一個眾聲喧嘩，真假難辨的時代，人們不再相信眼見為憑。商品除了賣相好，還得能親手觸碰到、聞到、體驗到，才是令消費者願意買帳的真實。
景觀設計也是一種充滿真實的商品。這種真實往往表現在它的科技、材料與人類感知之間的互動。如果沒有人類的感知，也就沒有所謂的景觀，充其量只是客觀的「環境」。巴西景觀設計師Benedito Abbud曾說，如果運用得當，景觀是唯一一門五感皆能參與其中的藝術表現。相較於建築、繪畫、雕塑強調視覺，音樂強調聽覺，景觀營造的效果除了賞心悅目之外，還包含了更豐富、更多變、與時推移的感官與情境。

景觀（Landscape）：不止於視覺
不用說，我們今天活在一個視覺導向的社會。據說人類所有的感知裡，光視覺一項就占了百分之七十以上。然而，除了這種先天的、生理的因素外，還有無數後天的、歷史政治的原因造就了這種視覺的霸權。舉例來說，文藝復興時期發明的透視圖技法，為西方社會建構出一套理性精確的構圖方式，一切物體的遠近高低，相對位置都可以單獨透過輔助線，網格及消點丈量決定。這一套視覺體系結合近代啟蒙的理性思維，流傳至今。成為一種觀看的法則。
沒有視覺當然也就沒有景觀，然而我們習慣將Landscape一詞理解為「景觀」，卻不免強化了其視覺涵義，同時也暗示了「人與土地」之間的距離感。換個角度來看，有學者認為「Landscape」一詞的概念最早可回溯至中世紀，代表當時封建制度下，一塊具有特定邊界，供農民耕作的土地（Land土地＋scape塑造）。然而，這一詞進入英語是十六世紀以後，用來指稱今日荷蘭沿海一帶，一種描述農村景象的繪畫類型。從此以後，Landscape一詞正式與繪畫產生了連結，沾染上了「觀看」的含意。
耐人尋味的是，後來語言學家把scape和scope兩字混淆，scope源自希臘文skopein「觀看」（look at），或是用來觀看的道具（telescope，microscope等），並不帶有「塑造」的含意，和scape在字源學上並不相干。把scape誤解成觀看scope，張冠李戴的後果，更加強化了scape就是視覺的印象。直到今天我們還是經常將Landscape理解為一種靜態的畫面，卻不明白它更早的來源其實著重在人與土地之間的互動。
中世紀地景的塑造者主要不是畫家，而是農民、漁夫和工匠。他們的目的不像畫家為了創造視覺上的愉悅，而是為了實際生存需求。靠雙手打磨鋤具、犁田、耕種，靠氣味採集，從四季遞嬗中讀取收割時節。他們或許比任何傑出的畫家更深入了解感官與土地之間的連繫。

台中清翠園：建構氣候與感官的實驗
比起中世紀歐洲，今天我們所接收的訊息量肯定是當時的幾百倍。尤其在科技之島台灣，每天睜開眼，都要面臨各種觀看的選擇（視而不見，視若無睹？）。街道上五顏六色的告示牌、公園裡的卡通公仔⋯⋯各種物件都試圖勾引著日漸疲乏的都市人眼球。我們都曾想過逃離日常這些紛擾的視覺牢籠。有鑑於此，近年來打著「感官體驗」為訴求的景觀設計中，有設計師嘗試利用人體對於觸覺（haptic）及溫度的感受，來轉移對「視覺」的過度依賴。
風土建築理論家Paul Oliver曾說，沒有任何環境因子比氣候一項，對人類生存發展有更重大的影響。對生活在台灣亞熱帶季風裡的大多數人，一年到頭外邊世界大半是無所遁逃的炎夏烈日，轟隆喧鬧的蒸騰背景。大多數公園，恐怕都無法抵消冷氣房裡一時的暢快。
也許是親身體會到台中市悶濕的氣候條件，了解台灣人長期夏日待在室內冷氣房的習性，瑞士建築師Philippe Rahm在台中水湳經貿園區的中央公園（台中清翠園）競圖案之中，重新審視「身體」作為一種感覺的容器，並且透過地景裝置，建立起一套偵測，調節並改善都市空氣的機制。讓使用者在參與過程中，在先進科技與原始感官的碰撞之中開啟了有趣的對話與想像。

根據設計說明，規劃團隊首先掌握影響人體舒適度的三種關鍵的氣候因素：溫度、濕度及汙染程度，利用流體力學模擬出全區空氣地圖，分析基地範圍內既有的微氣候狀況，及其對人體造成的感受差異，並且分區發展出適宜此氣候的活動。在具體設計上，Philippe Rahm研發出一套降溫、乾燥、去汙染的智慧型裝置，將地面熱氣吸入地底，冷卻後送回地表創造涼風，吸收空氣中有害物質。同時塑造地形，調整微氣候，利用遮蔭、闊葉喬木吸收濕氣，白花反射日光等手法，減少地表吸熱，增進人體的舒適程度。
靠溫度來殺風景？
有評論家認為，Philippe Rahm的作法，試圖擺脫「公園」長久以來過度重視「視覺美景」（vista）的傳統。藉由各式地景設施，喚醒使用者對體感、溫度、觸覺的感受，並將視覺的依賴降至最低。換句話說，這些看起來不知所以然，甚至有點「殺風景」的景觀設施，其設置的目的不正是為了「殺風景」？ 將人們從積習已久的視覺牢籠之中解放，回歸到純粹原始的體感經驗。
然而，這種做法卻也進一步引發了有關生物政治學的聯想。建築理論家Maria Giudici在一篇評論中指出，人類所有感覺系統中，對溫度的感受，是最不受到既有文化所操控的（試想：天氣熱了就想脫衣，冷了就想穿，禦寒避暑等行為，豈不是極自然的生理反應？）。另一方面，我們眼睛看見的、耳朵聽到的、舌頭嚐到的卻不如此，視覺、聽覺、味覺甚至嗅覺，都極易受到個人主觀因素如成長記憶，文化背景等影響。
因此，按照Maria Giudici的說法，建築師藉由控制公園內的氣候這一項基本環境因子來操縱人體最直觀的感受，將物理性的肉身組成分子重新擺回設計的核心，試圖排除了其它感官引發的複雜思維。這種做法，某方面像是將人類視為單純、可量化的「肉體」。去除了性別、種族、身分及社經地位，公園裡的人們彷彿置身於傅柯（Michel Foucault）筆下那座著名圓形監獄，不自覺被禁錮、物化在這種充滿權力階級的空間裡。而這些地景設施，看似靈魂的解放，事實上，會不會隱喻著身體的牢籠？

說來有點諷刺，當設計團隊挖空心思，大量運用高科技，最終目的也只是為了喚醒人體最原始的底層感官，這是否意味著我們日常生活中的物件與個人感知之間，早已出現了一道鴻溝？很可能在不久將來，新創科技也無法滿足的人們，如同動畫片「瓦力」所描述，四肢短胖，平板駑鈍，在幻彩繽紛的太空艙中日復一日，規律形同機械。而最終喚醒感知的，竟是一株鮮綠樹苗，與偶然碰觸的雙手溫度？
感官的行銷 vs. 公園的想像
台中清翠園一案以結果來看，業主買單了，獎金設計費也入袋了。然而對多數台中市民而言，如此新穎的設計理念能否被理解，可能還有待觀察。溽熱的炎陽下，有多少人願意捨棄自家冷氣房，老遠跑到公園體驗如同「花蓮瑞里的清淨空氣」？少了公仔、玩偶等打卡熱點的公園，這些所費不眥，號稱能製造涼風的地底冷卻系統，在經濟掛帥的政治現實中，也必然面臨虛擲公帑的質疑聲浪。
因此，這個占地近70公頃，造價27億的公園提案，是一個真正貼近民眾對亞熱帶戶外氣候的回應？或是另一個打著「感官體驗」為名的行銷案例？隨著基地周邊不斷推出新建案，房價持續看漲的態勢下，這個公園的後續效應會如何影響台灣當代大型公園的走向？
筆者認為，除非人們對於當代景觀設計的想像，能從傳統滿足視覺美景的功能，轉移到一種新型態的「氣候、溫度與人體感官」相互激盪的媒介，否則，它最終只會落得不負「清翠園」之名：一片看上去青青翠綠的公園，但也僅此而已。
筆者在某個夏天傍晚走進清翠園。發現一角設立了「觸覺體驗區」，乍看之下是一堆柱子排列，然而近看會發現，這些柱子由三種不同的石材組成：灰色鑿面花崗石，黑色自然面花崗石，以及類似白色大理石的結晶材料，這些材料擁有各自的質感，比熱等物理特性，摸上去表面有細緻、有光滑，有粗糙，有溫熱有微涼，供人觸摸感受。原本再平凡不過的景觀材料，經由設計者的言語包裝，居然也成為一件高價的「感官體驗」商品。
然而，在不明究裡的人眼中，它不過就是一堆柱子。

The five senses experience is a good business: How does Taichung Central Park, which kills the scenery, awaken the senses?
03 Nov 2019, 23:56 by fundus city affairs


What we want you to know is that when the design team of Taichung Crest Garden digs into the ground and uses a lot of high technology, the ultimate goal is only to awaken the most primitive sense of the human body. Does this mean that between the objects in our daily life and the perception of the individual? Has there been a gap?



Text: T.H. Cheng
Once upon a time, the ""five senses experience"" became the most common marketing slogan on the market today. A lot of goods (from music albums to night markets) are not hard to find similar ads. Under the consumer context of today's information explosion and eyeball economy, why does the ""sensory experience"" marketing method last forever? Perhaps because we are in an era of screaming, unrecognizable, people no longer believe in seeing. In addition to selling goods, the products have to be touched, smelled and experienced by hand, which is the truth that consumers are willing to buy.
Landscape design is also a kind of real product. This reality is often manifested in the interaction between its technology, materials and human perception. If there is no human perception, there is no such thing as a landscape. At best, it is only an objective ""environment."" Brazilian landscape designer Benedito Abbud once said that if used properly, the landscape is the only artistic expression in which all five senses can participate. Compared with architecture, painting, and sculpture, which emphasizes vision, music emphasizes hearing. The effect of landscape creation is not only pleasing to the eye, but also the senses and situations that are richer, more varied, and time-lapse.

Landscape: More than just vision
Needless to say, we live in a vision-oriented society today. It is said that in all human perceptions, light vision accounts for more than 70%. However, in addition to this innate and physiological factor, there are countless acquired, historical and political reasons that have created this visual hegemony. For example, the perspective technique invented in the Renaissance constructed a rational and accurate composition method for Western society. The relative position of all objects can be determined by the auxiliary line, grid and elimination point. This set of visual systems combined with the rational thinking of modern enlightenment has been passed down to the present day. Become a law of watching.
There is no vision, of course, there is no landscape. However, we are used to understanding the word Landscape as ""landscape"", but it can not only enhance its visual meaning, but also implies the sense of distance between ""people and land."" From another point of view, some scholars believe that the concept of ""Landscape"" can be traced back to the Middle Ages, representing a land with a specific boundary for farmers to cultivate under the feudal system (Land Land + scape). However, the word entered English after the sixteenth century, used to refer to the coastal area of the Netherlands today, a type of painting that describes the rural scene. Since then, the word ""Landscape"" has officially linked with painting, and it has been contaminated with the meaning of ""watching.""
Intriguingly, later linguists confused the words scape and scope. The scope was derived from the Greek skopein ""look at"" or the props used to watch (telescope, microscope, etc.) without ""shaping"" The meaning of "","" and scape are irrelevant in the etymology. Misunderstanding scape as a viewing scope, the consequences of Zhang Guan Li Dai, further enhanced the scape is a visual impression. Until today, we still often understand Landscape as a static picture, but we don't understand that its earlier source actually focuses on the interaction between people and land.
The shapers of medieval landscapes are mainly not painters, but farmers, fishermen and artisans. Their purpose is not like the painter in order to create visual pleasure, but to actually survive the needs. Use your hands to polish the cookware, plow the fields, cultivate, collect by the smell, and read the harvest season from the four seasons. They may have a deeper understanding of the connection between the senses and the land than any outstanding painter.


The sixteenth-century Dutch painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder was good at depicting the landscape of the peasants' daily life. His painting Hay Hatvest (1565) profoundly showed the connection between human dwelling and land at that time. It is now housed in the Lokwez Palace in Prague, Czech Republic.

Taichung Qing Cuiyuan: an experiment to construct climate and sensory
Compared to medieval Europe, the amount of information we receive today is certainly hundreds of times. Especially in Taiwan, the island of technology, every day, when you open your eyes, you have to face all kinds of viewing choices (turn a blind eye and turn a blind eye?). Colorful billboards on the streets, cartoon dolls in the park, and various objects are trying to seduce the eyes of the increasingly tired urbanites. We all thought about escaping the visual cages of everyday turmoil. In view of this, in recent years, in the landscape design with the ""sensory experience"" as the appeal, some designers have tried to use the human body's feelings of haptic and temperature to shift the excessive dependence on ""vision"".
Territorial architecture theorist Paul Oliver once said that there is no environmental factor that has a greater impact on human survival than climate. For most people living in the subtropical monsoon in Taiwan, most of the world outside the year is the sun and the sun, the raging background of the hustle and bustle. Most parks, I am afraid, can't offset the momentary air-conditioned room.
Perhaps it is the climatic conditions of the boring wetness in Taichung City. I understand the habits of Taiwanese people staying in indoor air-conditioned rooms for a long time. Swiss architect Philippe Rahm competes in the Central Park of Taichung Shuiyu Economic and Trade Park (Taizhong Qing Cui Garden). In the re-examination of the ""body"" as a container of sensation, and through the landscape device, a mechanism for detecting, regulating and improving urban air is established. Let users engage in interesting dialogues and imaginations in the collision of advanced technology and original senses during the participation process.

According to the design specification, the planning team first grasps three key climatic factors that affect human comfort: temperature, humidity and pollution degree, using fluid mechanics to simulate the air map of the whole area, analyzing the existing microclimate conditions within the base, and Differences in feelings caused by the human body, and the division develops activities suitable for this climate. In terms of specific design, Philippe Rahm developed a smart device for cooling, drying and decontamination, which sucks the ground hot air into the ground, cools it and returns it to the surface to create a cool breeze and absorb harmful substances in the air. At the same time, the terrain is shaped, the microclimate is adjusted, and the shading, broad-leaved trees absorb moisture, white flowers reflect sunlight, and the like, reducing surface heat absorption and improving human comfort.
By temperature to kill the scenery?
Some critics believe that Philippe Rahm's approach attempts to get rid of the ""park"" tradition that has long paid too much attention to ""vista"". Through various landscape facilities, the user's feelings of body, temperature and touch are awakened and the visual dependence is minimized. In other words, these landscapes that don’t seem to know why, even a bit of “killing the scenery”, are not designed to “kill the scenery”? Emancipate people from the long-awaited visual cage and return to the purely original somatosensory experience.
However, this practice has further led to the association of biopolitics. In a commentary, the architectural theorist Maria Giudici pointed out that in all human sensory systems, the feeling of temperature is the least controlled by the existing culture (Imagine: if the weather is hot, you want to undress, if you are cold, you want to wear it, Isn't it a very natural physiological reaction to keep warm and so on?). On the other hand, what our eyes see, what the ears hear, and what the tongue tastes are not. Visual, auditory, taste, and even smell are highly susceptible to personal subjective factors such as growing memories and cultural backgrounds.
Therefore, according to Maria Giudici, the architect manipulates the most intuitive feelings of the human body by controlling the basic environmental factors of the climate in the park, and re-enters the physical body components back to the core of the design, trying to exclude other senses. The complex thinking that is triggered. In this way, some aspects seem to regard human beings as a simple and quantifiable ""body."" With the removal of gender, race, identity and socio-economic status, the people in the park seem to be in the famous circular prison of Michel Foucault, unconsciously imprisoned and materialized in this space full of power class. These landscape facilities, like the liberation of the soul, in fact, will metaphorize the body's cage?


A variety of landscape devices that awaken the senses in Taichung Central Park. University of California professor Rob Thayer believes that when we perceive the landscape, we are always influenced by the three emotions of the land itself, the hobby of technology and the aversion to technology.

It is a bit ironic. When the design team digs into the ground and uses a lot of high technology, the ultimate goal is only to awaken the most primitive sense of the human body. Does this mean that there is a gap between the objects in our daily life and personal perception? It is very likely that in the near future, people who can't satisfy the new technology, as described in the cartoon ""Walli"", are short-legged, flat and blunt, and in the colorful space capsule day after day, the law is the same. The ultimate awakening of the perception is actually a fresh green sapling, with the temperature of the hands touched by chance?
Sensory marketing vs. park imagination
In the case of Taichung Qing Cuiyuan, the result was that the owner paid the bill and the bonus design fee was also included. However, for most Taichung citizens, it may be necessary to understand whether such a novel design concept can be understood. Under the hot sun, how many people are willing to give up their own air-conditioned rooms, and go to the park to experience the ""clean air of Hualien Ruili""? There are fewer parks for dolls, dolls, and other hot spots. These are not expensive. The underground cooling system, which claims to be able to create a cool breeze, is bound to face the suspicion of falsifying public money in the political reality of economic leadership.
Therefore, this park proposal covering nearly 70 hectares and costing 2.7 billion is a real response to the public's response to the subtropical outdoor climate. Or another marketing case under the name ""sensory experience""? With the continuous introduction of new cases around the base, and the continued upward trend in housing prices, how will the follow-up effect of this park affect the trend of Taiwan's contemporary large parks?
The author believes that unless people imagine the contemporary landscape design, they can transfer from the traditional function of satisfying the visual beauty to a new medium of climate, temperature and human senses. Otherwise, it will only end up in the end. The name of ""Cleaning Garden"": a park that looks green and green, but that's it.
The author walked into the Qing Cui Garden in the evening of a summer. I found a corner of the ""Tactile Experience Zone"". At first glance, it is a pile of pillars. However, in the near future, these pillars are composed of three different types of stone: gray chiseled granite, black natural granite, and Crystallized materials similar to white marble, these materials have their own texture, physical characteristics such as heat, touched the surface is fine, smooth, rough, warm and slightly cool, for people to feel. The original landscape material, which was originally ordinary, was also a high-priced ""sensory experience"" product through the designer's speech packaging.
However, in the eyes of those who are not clear, it is just a pile of pillars.
