The red bank also announced a AU$2.5 billion capital raise.

Westpac is preparing for a digital future, announcing on Monday that it is investing in a new digital-only banking platform.According to CEO Brian Hartzer, the new platform would complement Westpac's existing banking businesses.  ""This will initially operate a 'bank-as-a-service' model and we intend to bring new digital products and services to market through fintech and institutional partners,"" he said, delivering the bank's 2019 financial results.""This will allow Westpac to reach a new group of customers as well as create value for our partners by enhancing the service offering to their own customers.""The announcement was coupled with a minority equity investment in 10x Future Technologies, a UK-based cloud banking tech provider.
Hartzer said the bank's range of fintech partnerships would open up opportunities in an ""increasingly digitised world"".""This initiative builds on the significant investment we have made -- and will continue to make -- in modernising our platforms, including the Customer Service Hub and Panorama,"" the CEO continued. ""Together this will mean we have the right systems to meet changing customer needs now and in the future.""

Westpac said the increase was mainly due to a AU$349 million increase in provisions for estimated customer refunds, payments, associated costs, and litigation; higher technology expenses of AU$174 million; a rise in regulatory compliance; and investment-related spend of AU$171 million.During the year, Westpac implemented a new group-wide HR management system.
