      <h1>Courtland Sutton lays out for amazing diving TD catch (Video)</h1>

      <p>The Broncos have a young, talented group of wide receivers, and Courtland Sutton showed what his upside can look like with an unbelievable, highlight-reel grab in Sunday’s game against the Browns.</p>
      <p>Denver traded away Emmanuel Sanders due to their faith in the young receiver group, and Sutton helped show that the decision they made was a wise one on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The play took place in the first quarter of Sunday’s game, with the game scoreless. Denver was in scoring range, though, so Brandon Allen floated a ball to the end zone, intended for Sutton. Browns cornerback Denzel Ward had tight coverage on him, though, making a completion extremely difficult.</p>
      <p>No problem, though, as Sutton made an insane adjustment, then just laid out to make a ridiculous diving grab for the touchdown — beating Ward to the ball.</p>
