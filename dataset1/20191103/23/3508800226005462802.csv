善用「TOM」元素，讓敢於追求的你縮短現實與理想的差距
03 Nov 2019, 23:51 by 李政諭


我們想讓你知道的是期限（Time）、行動（Operation）、融合（Mix），簡稱TOM好了，如果未來我們能輕易地想起怎麼規劃行動方案，那不如就這麼稱呼它好了。



年輕時追求的是金錢，再來是好的工作、名聲，後來也許是一直忽視的健康，無論求學或是出了社會，不同階段的人生總是追求著不同的東西，每個人都有不同目標，但都一樣追求著，沒有不同。
偶而看到一本書、聽到一句話，開始建構理想生活的想像，不同的成長背景、價值觀或是思考邏輯，都能讓理想在不同的框架底下誕生，但從來沒有人告訴我們理想誕生之後，該怎麼去追求。
理想就是與現實之間的差距，我們該努力的，就是盡可能地縮短距離。
一個人的價值觀只要越明確，理想也越好取捨，這是因為不同價值的優先順序，只有在各自的心中才能清楚劃分，你可能在乎健康，不願意熬夜加班；他可能只在意金錢，無論工作份量都能任勞任怨。如果理想都是追求未來安穩的生活，同種理想卻可以靠著不同的路徑抵達。
對每個人而言，理想訂得太高或太低都不好，一種是不容易達成，另一種則是太容易完成，對於實際執行都是種困擾。就像運動，跟一個太強或太弱的對手競爭，對你的成長並沒有幫助，追求的理想也應該要設定成強度適中。
當大學成績慘不忍睹的我，下定決心要攻讀研究所
我大學時期的成績很差。
大四下準備考研究所，在這之前的七個學期，只有兩個學期沒有被當掉任何一科，平均成績則是只有一學期超過80分，最爛的一次連60分也沒有。大學生涯保有這樣的成績是很危險的，除了容易被退學之外，也有很多被當掉的科目需要在之後補修回來。
也因此，到了大四，大多數人可以開始準備規劃未來，投入時間在準備考試，或是準備相關的應徵文件，規劃自己的工作選項，而我，只能忙於應付那些不用功所欠的債，不停地補修。
當時，下定決心要攻讀研究所，也因此，該如何考上就是我當時必須達成的理想目標。
如何縮短與理想之間的差距？
首先，一定要給自己訂下一個完成的期限，替自己訂下一個能達成目標的期間，期間也能分成不同區段，像是短中長程時間區段的概念。
再來則是思考要達成目標時，所需完成的必要條件，或是自己需要補足什麼來完成必要條件，將項目盡可能地分解成能實際執行的項目。由上到下、由淺到深，粗略到具體地去思考每一項行動措施，有點類似於工作分解結構的概念（ Work Breakdown Structure）。
最後則是將以上兩種元素融合，以時間軸串連出整個行動指南，訂出具體的行動順序。就像闖關遊戲一樣，完成特定的要件逐步破關，最後總會打敗大魔王，大魔王可以想像成那個怠惰的、阻止你追求理想的自己。
期限（Time）、行動（Operation）、融合（Mix），簡稱TOM好了，如果未來我們能輕易地想起怎麼規劃行動方案，那不如就這麼稱呼它好了。
藉由上述說的，先依照學校的考試日期設定完成的期限，再依據每個要考的科目，由粗略到具體擬定該完成的事項。舉例來說，如果某間研究所的考試科目為民法，我就可以將這個科目再分成時事、學說、基礎等類別，又在這幾個類別當中設定該研讀哪些資料，從考試日期的期限將時間分成不同區段，與要執行的項目融合，就成了一套可以確實執行的行動方案。
短期之內我必須打好哪些基本功夫，中期來說我該如何持續精進，長期而言又該如何融會貫通、充分運用，才能幫助自己在面臨任何考題上都能得心應手。
記得永遠都要搞清楚一件事，完成一樣「具體事項」，並不等於會讓你靠得離目標近一點。
舉例來說，想要減肥所以需要運動器材，去購買了運動器材，卻忘了再將這個項目之下研擬更細緻的行動措施，缺乏了具體的運動計畫去使用，來達成減肥的效果。或是想要增進某方面的專業知識，看到新的參考書籍就選擇購買，卻完全沒有記得還要翻開來看，這都會讓你最終得到失敗的結果。
另外，也可以照時間的長短設定目標高低，如果是長期目標，在目標的設定上可以適中，甚至設定得再高一點點，也算是能夠激發潛能的方式，讓自己能在可行的目標上突破自我。如果是短期要達成的目標，那目標就一定要具體，而且是可以達成的項目。
當年懞懂的埋頭苦幹，是不是比較快樂？
前面講了那麼多，其實也都是後話了。
當年懵懂的埋頭苦幹，也從不了解過程該有的思維結構，也幸好懵懂地得到自己想要的結果。
後來，我總會想起，那幾年在課業上人言微輕的幾個時刻，不在世俗眼光的評分下突出，是否會讓自己顯得進退兩難，找不到立足點或是自己的價值了呢？
於是學生生涯的我們，開始投身在比較分數的軍備競爭當中，其他科目的成就永遠比不上主科，名次、學校用來定義一個人的高低，衡量一個人的未來價值。
出社會後開始賺錢，比較的是收入高低、待遇多少，又有多少人能肯定地說出不畏世俗做著自己想做的事，又能保有多少時間讓自己留戀在單純喜歡的事物上面。
放下以前喜歡的，跟著追求社會眼光喜歡的，這樣的生活真的快樂嗎？
以前吃著小美冰淇淋就覺得很快樂，後來吃著哈根達斯（Häagen-Dazs）卻也沒有那種感覺了。
期待在寫下每段後話之前，能在人生每個階段的課題當中，率先得到解答。一起共勉。

Make good use of the ""TOM"" element, let the courageous pursuit shorten the gap between reality and ideal
03 Nov 2019, 23:51 by Li Zhengyu


What we want you to know is Time, Operation, Mix, TOM is good. If we can easily think about how to plan the action plan in the future, it is better to call it.



When you are young, you are pursuing money. It is good work and reputation. Later, it may be the health that has been neglected. Whether you are studying or going out of society, life at different stages always pursues different things. Everyone has different goals. But they all pursue the same, no difference.
Occasionally I saw a book, heard a sentence, began to construct the imagination of an ideal life, different growth backgrounds, values or thinking logic, can make the ideal born under different frameworks, but no one has ever told us that after the ideal is born, How to pursue.
The ideal is the gap with reality. What we should work hard is to shorten the distance as much as possible.
As long as the individual's values are more clear, the ideals are better. This is because the priority of different values can only be clearly divided in their own hearts. You may care about health and do not want to work overtime. He may only care about money, regardless of the amount of work. Can work hard. If the ideal is to pursue a stable life in the future, the same kind of ideal can be reached by different paths.
For everyone, the ideal is too high or too low to be too good, one is not easy to achieve, the other is too easy to complete, it is a problem for the actual implementation. Just like sports, competing with an opponent who is too strong or too weak does not help your growth. The ideal of pursuit should also be set to moderate intensity.
When the university’s performance was terrible, I was determined to study at the Institute.
My college results were very poor.
In the seven semester before the junior high school, only two semesteres were not taken out of any subject. The average score was only one semester of more than 80 points, and the worst one was not even 60 points. It is very dangerous to maintain such a grade in a college career. In addition to being easily dropped out of school, there are also many subjects that have been taken out and need to be repaired later.
Therefore, when I am a senior, most people can start to plan for the future, invest time in preparing for the exam, or prepare relevant application documents, plan their own work options, and I can only cope with those debts that are not owed. , keep on repairing.
At that time, I was determined to study at the Institute. Therefore, how to get it is the ideal goal that I must achieve at that time.
How to shorten the gap between the ideal and the ideal?
First of all, be sure to set a deadline for completing yourself, and set a period for you to achieve the goal. The period can also be divided into different sections, such as the concept of short, medium and long time zones.
Then come to think about the necessary conditions to accomplish when you want to achieve your goals, or what you need to do to complete the necessary conditions and break down the project into projects that can actually be executed. From top to bottom, from shallow to deep, roughly and specifically think about each action measure, somewhat similar to the Work Breakdown Structure.
Finally, the above two elements are merged, and the entire action guide is connected in time series to set a specific sequence of actions. Just like the game, the completion of certain elements gradually breaks through, and in the end it will defeat the Great Devil. The Big Devil can imagine itself as a lazy, self-defeating pursuit of ideals.
Time, Operation, Mix, TOM is good. If we can easily think about how to plan the action plan in the future, it is better to call it.
According to the above, the deadline for completion of the school is set according to the test date of the school, and the completed matter is roughly formulated according to each subject to be tested. For example, if the examination subject of a research institute is civil law, I can divide the subject into current affairs, doctrine, basics, etc., and set which materials to study in these categories, from the date of the test date. Time is divided into different sections, and the integration with the project to be executed becomes a set of action plans that can be implemented.
In the short term, I have to do a good job of basic skills. In the medium term, how can I continue to improve, and in the long run, how to integrate and fully utilize it, in order to help myself to be able to handle any questions.
Remember to always figure out one thing and accomplish the same ""concrete matter"". It does not mean that you will be closer to the target.
For example, if you want to lose weight, you need sports equipment to buy sports equipment, but you forget to develop more detailed action measures under this project, and lack specific sports plans to achieve weight loss. . Or if you want to improve your expertise, you can choose to buy a new reference book, but you don't have to remember to open it. This will eventually lead to a failure.
In addition, you can set the target level according to the length of time. If it is a long-term goal, you can set the target level moderately, or even set it a little higher. It can be a way to stimulate potential, so that you can break through the feasible goals. self. If it is a short-term goal, then the goal must be specific and achievable.
Was it more happy when I was immersed in hard work?
I talked so much about it before, but it’s all in fact.
When I was ignorant of my hard work, I never understood the thinking structure of the process, but I was fortunate enough to get the results I wanted.
Later, I always remembered that in the past few years, the few words in the academic field were not prominent under the scoring of the secular vision. Will it make you seem to be in a dilemma, can't find a foothold or your own value?
Therefore, in our student life, we began to participate in the arms competition of comparative scores. The achievements of other subjects are never comparable to the main subjects. Rankings, schools are used to define the level of a person, and measure the future value of a person.
After starting out to the society, I started to make money. I compare the income level and the treatment rate. How many people can definitely say that they are doing what they want to do without fear of the world, and how much time they can keep their love for things they simply like.
Let's put down what I liked before, and follow the pursuit of social vision, is this life really happy?
I used to eat Xiaomei Ice Cream and felt very happy. Later, eating Häagen-Dazs didn't feel that way.
I look forward to being able to get answers first in each stage of my life before writing down each paragraph. Together.
