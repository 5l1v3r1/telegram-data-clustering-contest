牡蠣 vs. 堤防：比起混凝土，「生態防洪」會是固守海岸線更好的選擇

我們想讓你知道的是研究人員在美國北卡羅來納州博福特（Beaufort）附近的海岸建置牡蠣基床，並測試該結構對海岸線的保護效果。強化濕地比興築高牆更能保護海岸線。

2011年8月27日，艾琳颶風（Hurricane Irene）重擊美國北卡羅來納州，掏空外灘區，傾瀉的暴雨淹及小腿肚，狂風捲起3公尺高巨浪，奔騰衝向陸地前方的堰洲島，摧毀多處道路及1100棟房屋。
颶風過後，當時在北卡羅來納大學教堂山分校任職的年輕生態學家吉特曼（Rachel K. Gittman）決定進行災區研究。吉特曼曾在美國海軍擔任穩固海岸線計畫環境顧問，對於海岸韌性（coastal resilience）相關資訊的極度缺乏感到相當驚訝，她解釋：「研究做得越深，我就益發意識到我們對此並不了解，在制定這麼多的政策及管理措施時，竟沒有任何科學依據。」她決定投身海岸線研究，並專攻此領域。
吉特曼的發現令人大開眼界。沿著受到重創的美國海岸線，有3/4的防水牆（bulkhead）損壞。這些2公尺高的堤防通常以混凝土建造，是美國沿海地區許多屋主用來抵擋海浪的標準設施。然而，所有天然沼澤構成的海岸線都沒有受損，這些沼澤地從海岸向陸地延伸10～40公尺，完全沒有因為艾琳颶風的侵襲而流失沉積物或降低高度。雖然颶風過境導致植被密度減少至少1/3，但一年過後，綠色植物又恢復生機，許多區域的植被厚度一如往常。

吉特曼的研究證實了許多專家早先的猜測：混凝土防水牆雖然幫海岸線「穿上盔甲」，但面對巨型暴風雨時，它的保護效果並不如想像的那麼強。這些防水牆會反射而非分散海浪的能量，導致本身的基部磨損，使防水牆逐漸傾倒。雖然防水牆在一般暴風雨中仍能發揮功效，一旦來襲的暴潮高過它們時，反而遭受海水從後方衝擊，導致碎裂或坍塌，整座後院流入海中。
在後續的一項研究中，吉特曼和其他研究人員查訪689名沿海的屋主，發現93％的災害損失集中在37％以防水牆保護的住宅，這些防水牆住宅每年的維護成本是採用自然保護措施住宅的4倍。而天然鹽沼（saltmarsh）雖然變了樣，卻沒被沖垮。
近年來，越來越多科學家及政策制定者相信，「生態海岸線」——紅樹林、牡蠣礁、海灘和珊瑚礁等天然鹽沼群落——能發揮出人意表的效果，讓沿海居民贏回失守多年的海岸線。
由於海平面上升、超強風暴以及海岸開發失控，造成大規模土地侵蝕及洪水危害，美國海岸線正在逐漸瓦解。美國每天有89公頃的國土遭波浪吞噬，每年造成5億美元的財產損失。整體而言，美國有40％的海岸線持續遭受侵蝕，某些地方的流失速度令人吃驚。只要利用Google Earth的縮時影像功能，就可以看見沙克福爾海岸（Shackleford Banks）宛如炎炎夏日被丟在人行道上的冰淇淋，不斷消融。
過去，幾乎所有保護海岸的資金都花在「灰色」的基礎設施上：防波堤、防水牆、堤防和岩石護岸。現在，情況開始改變，研究人員越來越能夠精確評估「綠色」海岸防禦技術的長期影響，保險公司和政府也開始關注生態防洪（living defense）並跟上這股潮流。
濕地勝過堤防
艾琳颶風肆虐美國東海岸時，貝克（Michael W. Beck）正與保險公司展開一項可能會改變海岸保護方式的合作計畫，他當時是美國自然保育協會（Nature Conservancy）的首席海洋科學家，現在是加州大學聖克魯茲分校的研究教授。貝克在聖克魯茲的辦公室告訴我：「很多人都說生態系統有助於防洪，但證據薄弱。」
事實上，生態防洪的物理機制相當明確：牡蠣礁和珊瑚礁可做為天然防波堤（離岸海堤），它們的波紋表面能分散波浪的能量，把侵蝕及洪水的破壞力降到最低。鹽沼和紅樹林能形成泥土堤岸，並靠著密佈的植物莖稈產生阻力，在15公尺的距離內削減一半以上的暴潮能量。
儘管科學家了解生態防洪的物理學原理，卻沒有人將其轉化為易於政策制定者參考的型式。貝克開始嘗試解決這個問題，他解釋：「如果我想改變做法，不能直接把我的生態系統模型直接提供給美國聯邦緊急災難處理署（Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA）或美國陸軍工兵團使用，必須依照他們的風險模型，將生態系統納入其中。」
貝克和同事開始與英國倫敦勞合社（Lloyd's of London）、瑞士再保公司（Swiss Re）等保險公司合作，這些公司擁有最好的資產風險數據及模型。貝克把沿海生態系統的數據輸入他們的風險模型當中，結果相當明顯：「生態海岸線」是絕佳的防洪措施。他還指出：「我告訴工兵團、FEMA和開發銀行，這些數據都是來自保險公司，受到信賴的程度立刻提高。」
第一項研究鎖定2012年桑迪超級風暴（Superstorm Sandy）肆虐紐約和紐澤西州所帶來的損害，這群科學家與大型保險公司「風險管理解決」（Risk Management Solutions）合作，發現濕地能遏阻風暴水災的損失高達6億2500萬美元，尤其該地區海岸的保護性濕地在過去已經流失60～90％，這樣的結果實在令人驚訝。
這些碩果僅存的濕地在淹水地區平均降低了11％的洪水災害，同時具有一般的洪水緩衝能力。在一項當地研究中，發現有沼澤做為緩衝的房產，每年遭受的洪水損失比沒有沼澤緩衝的房產少16％。貝克指出：「這樣的幅度足以讓屋主減少預期支付的保費。」

Oyster vs. Embankment: ""Ecological flood control"" is a better choice for anchoring the coastline than concrete
03 Nov 2019, 23:55 by ""Science Man"" Fans


What we want you to know is that the researchers built an oyster bed on the coast near Beaufort, North Carolina, USA, and tested the structure's protection of the coastline. Strengthening wetlands can protect coastlines more than building high walls.



Written by: Rowan Jacobsen Translation: Lin Huizhen
On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene slammed the state of North Carolina, smashing the Bund area, pouring rain and flooding the calves. The wind blew up 3 meters high waves and rushed to the front of the land. Weizhou Island, destroying many roads and 1,100 houses.
After the hurricane, Rachel K. Gittman, a young ecologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, decided to conduct research in the disaster area. Gitman, who served as an environmental consultant for the Stabilization of Coastline Planning in the US Navy, was quite surprised by the extreme lack of information on coastal resilience. She explained: ""The deeper the research, the better I realize that we are I don't understand that there is no scientific basis for formulating so many policies and management measures."" She decided to devote herself to shoreline research and specialize in this field.
Gitman's discovery is eye-opening. Along the heavily damaged US coastline, 3/4 of the bulkhead was damaged. These 2 metre high embankments are usually constructed of concrete and are standard facilities used by many homeowners in the US coastal area to withstand the waves. However, the coastlines of all natural marshes have not been damaged. These marshes extend 10 to 40 meters from the coast to the land, and there is no loss of sediment or height due to the invasion of hurricane Irene. Although the hurricane transit caused the vegetation density to decrease by at least 1/3, after one year, the green plants returned to life, and the vegetation thickness in many areas was as usual.

Gitman's research confirms many experts' earlier speculations that although the concrete waterproof wall ""wears armor"" to the shoreline, its protection is not as strong as it might seem in the face of a giant storm. These waterproof walls reflect, rather than disperse, the energy of the waves, causing the base to wear and the water wall to gradually fall over. Although the waterproof wall can still function in the general storm, once the incoming storm is higher than them, the seawater will be impacted from the rear, causing fragmentation or collapse, and the entire backyard will flow into the sea.
In a follow-up study, Gitman and other researchers visited 689 coastal homeowners and found that 93% of disaster losses were concentrated on 37% of homes protected by waterproof walls. The annual maintenance cost of these waterproof wall homes is The nature protection measures are 4 times that of the house. The natural salt marsh (saltmarsh), although changed, was not washed away.
In recent years, more and more scientists and policy makers believe that “ecological coastlines” – mangrove forests, oyster reefs, beaches and natural salt marshes such as coral reefs – can play an unexpected role, allowing coastal residents to win back. Years of coastline.
The US coastline is gradually disintegrating due to rising sea levels, super storms, and out of control of coastal development, resulting in large-scale land erosion and flood damage. Every day, 89 hectares of land in the United States is swallowed up by waves, causing $500 million in property damage each year. Overall, 40% of the US coastline continues to be eroded, and the rate of loss in some places is surprising. Just use Google Earth's time-lapse imagery feature to see the ice cream on the sidewalk that Shackleford Banks is like on a hot summer day.
In the past, almost all of the funds protecting the coast were spent on “gray” infrastructure: breakwaters, waterproof walls, dikes and rock revetments. Now that things are starting to change, researchers are increasingly able to accurately assess the long-term impact of “green” coastal defense technologies, and insurance companies and governments are beginning to focus on ecological defense and keep up with this trend.
Wetlands outweigh the dike
When Hurricane Irene ravaged the East Coast of the United States, Michael W. Beck was working with insurance companies on a collaborative project that could change the way coastal protection was done. He was then the chief marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy. Now a research professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Baker told me at the Santa Cruz office: ""Many people say that ecosystems help to prevent flooding, but the evidence is weak.""
In fact, the physical mechanisms of ecological flood protection are quite clear: oyster reefs and coral reefs can be used as natural breakwaters (offshore seawalls) whose corrugated surfaces dissipate the energy of the waves and minimize the damage of erosion and flooding. Salt marshes and mangroves can form earth embankments and generate resistance by dense plant stems, cutting more than half of the storm energy at a distance of 15 meters.
Although scientists understand the physical principles of ecological flood protection, no one has turned it into a model that is easy for policy makers to refer to. Baker began to try to solve this problem. He explained: ""If I want to change my practice, I can't directly provide my ecosystem model directly to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers. Integrate ecosystems into their risk models.""
Baker and colleagues began working with insurance companies such as Lloyd's of London and Swiss Re, which have the best asset risk data and models. Baker puts coastal ecosystem data into their risk models, and the results are quite obvious: the “ecological coastline” is an excellent flood protection measure. He also pointed out: ""I told the Corps of Engineers, FEMA and the Development Bank that the data came from insurance companies and the level of trust immediately increased.""
The first study locked in the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, which ravaged New York and New Jersey. The scientists collaborated with the big insurance company Risk Management Solutions to find wetlands. The loss that can curb storm floods is as high as $625 million. In particular, the protective wetlands on the coast of the region have lost 60-90% in the past. This is surprising.
These surviving wetlands have reduced floods by an average of 11% in flooded areas and have a general flood buffer capacity. In a local study, swamps were found to be a buffered property, with 16% less flood damage per year than those without swamp buffers. Baker pointed out: ""This is enough to allow homeowners to reduce the premiums they are expected to pay.""
