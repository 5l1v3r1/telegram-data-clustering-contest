      <p>Looks like <b>AOA</b>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seolhyun">Seolhyun</a> made some fans "<i>jealous</i>" with her recent feat.</p>
      <p>Recently, amid AOA's celebrated appearance on <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Queendom</b>', Seolhyun took to Instagram Live and interacted with her fans in the car. During the live stream, fans asked Seolhyun if she ever became close with <b>Oh My Girl</b> members, to which she answered with a knowing smile.</p>

      <p>She responds, "<i>I'm not sure to what degree you mean by 'becoming close,' but I snagged <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/jiho">Jiho</a>'s number.</i>"</p>
      <p>Right after uttering those words, Jiho gave a cunning smirk and playfully bragged for obtaining such a coveted piece of information! When a fan jokingly called her out by writing, "<i>Unnie, why are you bragging?</i>", Seolhyun responded with a cheeky smile, "<i>Well, I know her number~ You're jealous, right? /LOL/</i>"</p>
