小孩得流感到底要停課幾天？現場幼教老師的觀點
03 Nov 2019, 23:52 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是孩子罹患了有傳染性的疾病，或是因為班級腸病毒停課必須停課自主隔離，家長要在家照顧固然必須負擔請假壓力又心力損耗。但如果能夠確實執行居家隔離，就可以避免把病毒帶給更多孩子、把不方便帶給更多家庭。



文：Tin-Tin Chou
十月天氣轉涼以後，園內先是一波腸病毒停課，國慶假期又開始有好幾例的A型流感確診，包括幼兒、家長和老師都難逃病毒攻擊。
一直到上個星期還有零星確診個案出現，而這位個案爸爸對於孩子停課的思考和反應，也一直讓我覺得應該從現場幼教老師的角度，來談談關於小孩生病到底要停課幾天的問題。
星期一的時候，隔壁班老師帶著一位爸爸來班上找我，說孩子上週五確診是A流病例，今天孩子卻來學校了，老師無法說服爸爸帶孩子回家隔離，想問問我有沒有相關的防疫措施必須配合。
這是我跟爸爸的對話：
我：「請問爸爸，Y小朋友是什麼時候確診是A型流感的呢？」Y爸：「上個星期五，不過醫生開克流感吃了以後就退燒了，這兩天都沒發燒啊！小孩精神也很好，她跟妹妹兩個都有打流感疫苗，沒什麼症狀了，看起來都沒事了。」我：「確定是A型流感？吃的藥是克流感嗎？」Y爸：「對。」我：「藥吃完了嗎？克流感的藥有五天對嗎？」Y爸：「呃…還沒吃完，今天有寫餵藥單。所以她不能來學校嗎？」
我向爸爸解釋：目前全國有明定幼兒園停課天數及標準的是腸病毒，流感的部分我們查過了：衛福部疾管局建議流感確診患者宜居家隔離十天，台北市則是有325的流感停課標準（三天內同一班級有兩名以上學生經醫師臨床診斷為感染流感時，建議該班停課五天含例假日）。
「再加上雖然兩姊妹有打流感疫苗所以看起來症狀很輕，但因為快篩結果是A流，代表身上有病毒，是有傳染性的。因為我們不在台北市，所以也只能柔性勸導您，依照醫生指示在家隔離，請問醫生建議您要讓孩子在家休息幾天呢？」
Y爸：「呃……」爸爸有點支吾，沒有回答我的問題，表情有點尷尬。
我接著告訴爸爸，我知道孩子生病在家真的造成父母照顧上很大的負擔，但因為流感的傳染性強且時間長，一旦造成班級中的群聚感染，會有更多的孩子和家長受到健康與生活上的影響。更何況，園裡有許多孩子家中還有襁褓中的弟弟妹妹，年紀越小的寶寶感染病毒越難照顧，甚至要住院治療。這些事情都是我們為人父母所不樂見。
Y爸最後接受了，找了個台階給自己下，說是孩子吵著要來上學，他去說服看看小孩願不願意回家好了。當老師的我們也才鬆了一口氣，感謝他願意理解與幫忙。
私下作為母親的角色，這一陣子以來也看到身邊好幾個好友因為孩子接連因為生病、班級中有腸病毒停課而必須在家隔離，等到終於可以上課了，卻又被因為手足感染流感應該建議在家隔離的孩子來班上上課，沒多久又被傳染，爸媽只好又輪流請假一個禮拜在家照顧生病居家隔離的孩子。
可以感受到的是，孩子生病的確會造成父母工作請假與照顧上的很大的負擔。上星期看到新聞報導有多個民間團體開記者會，爭取家中幼兒腸病毒停課隔離的家長，能夠有七天的有薪家庭照顧假。除了希望有支援家長的相關政策及配套措施能夠被規劃並且實施之外，在罹患傳染病自主隔離方面的衛教宣導和意識喚醒，才是更加重要且從根本改善疫情擴散的做法。
孩子罹患了有傳染性的疾病，或是因為班級腸病毒停課必須停課自主隔離，家長要在家照顧固然必須負擔請假壓力又心力損耗。但如果能夠確實執行居家隔離，就可以避免把病毒帶給更多孩子、把不方便帶給更多家庭。

How many days does the child have to stop the flu? View of the preschool teacher
03 Nov 2019, 23:52 by readers


What we want you to know is that the child has a contagious disease, or because the class guinea virus has to suspend classes and must be suspended for self-segregation. Parents must take care of their homework and suffer from stress. But if you can actually perform home isolation, you can avoid bringing the virus to more children and bringing inconvenience to more families.



Text: Tin-Tin Chou
After the weather turned cold in October, a wave of enterovirus was suspended in the park. Several cases of influenza A were diagnosed during the National Day holiday, including children, parents and teachers.
Until last week, there were sporadic confirmed cases, and the father’s thinking and reaction to the child’s suspension of classes also made me feel that I should talk about the child’s illness from the perspective of the kindergarten teacher. problem.
On Monday, the teacher from the next class took a dad to come to the class to find me, saying that the child was diagnosed with A-stream case on Friday. Today the child came to school. The teacher could not convince Dad to take the child home to isolate, would like to ask I have no relevant epidemic prevention measures that must be coordinated.
This is my conversation with my father:
Me: ""When is Dad, when is the child diagnosed with influenza A?"" Y Dad: ""Last Friday, but the doctor started to flu after eating the flu, and did not have a fever for the past two days! It's also very good. She and her sister both have flu shots. There are no symptoms. It seems to be fine."" I: ""Is it flu? Is the flu? Is it flu?"" Y Dad: ""Yes. ""I: ""Is the medicine finished? Is there five days for the flu medicine?"" Y Dad: ""Hey... I haven’t finished eating yet. I have a medication order today. So she can’t come to school?”
I explained to my father: At present, there are intestinal viruses in the Mingding kindergarten and the standard is the enterovirus. The flu part of the flu has been checked: the Weifu Department of Disease Management recommends that the flu-confirmed patients should be separated from home for ten days, and the Taipei City has 325. Influenza suspension criteria (three or more students in the same class within three days of clinical diagnosis of influenza infection, it is recommended that the class be suspended for five days including holiday).
""Plus, although the two sisters have flu shots, it seems to be very mild, but because the quick screening result is A flow, it means there is a virus on the body. It is contagious. Because we are not in Taipei, we can only be flexible."" You are separated at home according to the doctor's instructions. Does the doctor advise you to let your child rest at home for a few days?""
Y Dad: ""Hey..."" Dad was a bit sloppy, didn't answer my question, and his expression was awkward.
I went on to tell my father, I know that the child’s illness at home really causes a great burden on the parents. However, because the flu is highly contagious and takes a long time, more children and parents will be affected once the group is infected. Health and life impact. What's more, there are many children in the park who also have brothers and sisters in Suizhong. The younger the baby, the more difficult it is to take care of the virus, and even hospitalization. These things are unpleasant for our parents.
Y Dad finally accepted, and found a step for himself, saying that the child is clamoring to come to school, he went to persuade to see if the child would like to go home. When we were a teacher, we were relieved and thanked him for his understanding and help.
Privately as a mother, this time I have seen several good friends around me because the children have to be separated from home because of illness, classy virus in class, and wait until they can finally go to class, but they should be recommended because of the flu in the hands and feet. The isolated children came to class for class, and it was not long before they were infected. Parents had to take time off to take care of the sick children at home for a week.
What can be felt is that the child's illness does cause a great burden on parents to take time off for work and care. Last week, I saw a news report that a number of non-governmental organizations opened a press conference. Parents who were forced to stop the isolation of children with enterovirus in their homes were able to have seven days of paid family care leave. In addition to the hope that the relevant policies and supporting measures for supporting parents can be planned and implemented, the health education propaganda and awareness awakening in the isolation of infectious diseases will be more important and fundamentally improve the spread of the epidemic.
The child has a contagious disease, or because the class of enterovirus is suspended, the class must be suspended for independent isolation. Parents must take care of the leave and have to lose time. But if you can actually perform home isolation, you can avoid bringing the virus to more children and bringing inconvenience to more families.
