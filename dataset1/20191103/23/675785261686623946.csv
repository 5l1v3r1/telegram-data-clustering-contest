Andrew Scarborough has reportedly quit Emmerdale after two years of playing Graham Foster.
The actor is set to leave the village in dramatic scenes that will be filmed over the next few weeks and will air in the new year, sources have claimed.
It has also been rumoured that his exit storyline will involve his ongoing feud with ex-lover and businesswoman Kim Tate.
A source recently told the Daily Star On Sunday : ""Andrew's been a great addition to the cast and has been involved in some of Emmerdale's biggest storylines since he arrived in the village in 2017.""

The telly source added: ""So he was never going to leave in the back of a taxi.
""His exit will be huge and will kick start a drama filled and action packed year in the Dales.""
In recent Emmerdale action, Graham rejected Kim Tate, which led to her threatening to ruin his new romance with Rhona Goskirk.
As Graham was the person to expose Kim's son Jamie as being the mole that gave police evidence to send her to prison, their bitter feud has many ups and downs.
Graham mysteriously arrived in the village in 2017 and it was soon discovered that he was involved in the death of his wife and child while drink driving.

He's also rumoured to be the biological father of Millie with Andrea Tate.
Graham has played the Dales residents against one another after exposing Nicola King's deception earlier in the year, and he previously admitted that he had even more sinister plans for the village.
Kim returned in October last year and it was clear that she and Graham had a romantic history together and that he was unflinchingly loyal towards her.
Although Graham's exit hasn't been confirmed, rumours suggest his departure will involve a bitter battle.
Mirror Online has reached out to Emmerdale for comment.
