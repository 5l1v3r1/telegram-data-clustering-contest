A man is facing charges in Florida, according to reports, for allegedly picking up a Chihuahua in a metal cage and throwing it at a family member during a fight last Tuesday night.
Stephone Johnson, 27, was said to have threatened to harm his cousin during the argument in St. Petersburg, and then threw the cage with the 1-year-old Chihuahua named Roscoe inside, the Tampa Bay Times reported.
Johnson, now facing a misdemeanor battery charge, investigators said, admitted to the crime after officers questioned him.
