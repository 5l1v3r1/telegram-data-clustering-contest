Ulster Club SFC: Naomh Conaill show little sign of fatigue

03 Nov 2019, 23:15

Castlerahan (Cavan) 0-11 - 1-11 Naomh Conaill (Donegal)
Cavan’s bid to break their luck in the Ulster Club SFC continues after Castlerahan were defeated yesterday by Naomh Conaill at Kinspan Breffni Par.
Ciarán Thompson’s 25th-minute goal proved the crucial score, as the Donegal champions — who were crowned on Wednesday night — held a three point (0-5 to 1-5) interval lead.
The result looked signed and sealed with Naomh Conaill sub Dermot Molloy made it 1-10 to 0-6 after 42 minutes but their hosts came storming back to make a real fight of it.
With county star Cian Mackey now pulling the strings, Castlerahan slowly reeled in their opponents and a brace of points from the excellent Cormac Daly made it a two-point game by the 63rd minute.
In a fiery finish, the red carding of substitute Gavin Daly time added further salt into Castlerahan’s wound. Three minutes later the Tír Chonaill men sealed a date with Clontibret in the semi-finals with a fine score from Anthony Thompson.
CASTLERAHAN: J Leahy; S Cooney (0-1), K McEnroe, E O’Connell; S O’Reilly, O Kiernan, F Reilly; Pauric Smith, C Daly (0-4); K Cosgrave (0-3, 1f), B Ennis (0-1), Paul Smith; O O’Connell, R Flanagan, E Flanagan (0-1).
