【台三線藝術季3-3】15公分小人在監視器上　臉戴口罩看新竹北埔
03 Nov 2019, 23:57 by 游琁如, 胡耀仁
跟著台三線藝術季來到新竹北埔，策展人Eva為這場大展下了有趣的眉批：「客家的二字，是作客他方並以此為家，與遷徙地之文化進行有機的交合。」移民文化的態度，使得北埔的作品更與在地緊緊依存，藏於屋瓦夾縫，唯有極為緩慢步行搜尋才能識得。
走在北埔小鎮巷裡，藝術品不似其他地區以自然的融和為追求出現，而是幾乎隱身在市井中。作品原來可以如此微小卻同時強烈。走在小鎮裡，藝術與空間以一種沉著不打擾的方式彼此相擁。


紅磚屋頂上，身著蓑衣倚著藍天白雲而立。



灰牆上頭略帶沮喪的姿態。

西班牙籍雕塑家伊薩克·科達爾在屋頂紅磚之上、監視器、窗框上頭，製作出約15公分高的塑像。帶有沮喪氣息的中年男子，膚色似亞洲人與白人，頭戴斗笠，有時身型瑟縮蜷曲，偶見雙手插腰探看土地。行走在北埔因防禦建築的蜿蜒街道，一支監視器上頭，竟有呼應時事的蒙面小人站立，這場與城市空間的對話，如同沉默的咆哮，令人震撼。


戴著口罩站在監視器上，反映了香港蒙面法的時事。



排氣孔上，他扭曲於上，無法抬頭。



編竹夾泥牆上，身著蓑衣戴斗笠的人在上頭。

一間歇業中的老製材廠前面的《砍下一棵油桐樹》，一棵油桐樹被高高吊起，吊掛是製材中基礎重要的環結，經歷50年的製材業，老師傅邊說他眼中的樹與城市人心中的罕有截然不同，樹曾經是賴以維生工具，如今衰落，他仍滿足。


策展人Eva創建出一個優雅藏於小鎮的藝術氛圍。



歇業中的製材場，油桐樹以隱藏的姿態被吊起，彷彿工廠仍在運轉。

蕃薯伯與捕習工作室的《北埔嗅吸之間》透過南埔穀倉創作者蕃薯伯的空間，將源自客家傳統生活的氣味置於其中。膨風茶、青草味、市場梅干菜味、油蔥酥、竹子、柿子、樟樹等氣味，展現味道與生活的氣息。


蕃薯伯自己編織舊時穀倉，成為藝術季的一部分。



台灣光復前後使用的穀倉，在南埔還能找到。



10種當地氣味，譜出北埔的客家記憶。

詹姆士·塔普斯柯特將《Arc Zero》藏在環繞北埔小鎮的秀巒山上，簡潔線條的燈光鋼架引入當地溪水，水霧裝置灑於山林，在夜晚宛如走入山中隧道，真實又迷幻。


飄渺氣質的《Arc Zero》，夜裡看也像火圈，框入後方的客家人紀念碑。

[Taiwan three-line art season 3-3] 15 cm villain on the monitor face wearing a mask to see Hsinchu Beipu
03 Nov 2019, 23:57 by You Ruru, Hu Yaoren
Following the Taiwanese third-line art season, he came to Hsinchu, Hsinchu. The curator Eva made an interesting eyebrow for this exhibition: ""The word of Hakka is to be a guest and use it as a home to make an organic relationship with the culture of the migratory land. The attitude of immigrant culture makes Beipu's works more closely related to the locality. It is hidden in the roof tile, and it can only be recognized by walking slowly.
Walking in the town lane of Beipu, the art is not like other areas with the pursuit of natural harmony, but almost hidden in the market. The work can be so small but strong at the same time. Walking in the town, art and space embrace each other in a calm and undisturbed way.


On the red brick roof, wearing a coat and leaning against the blue sky and white clouds.



The gray wall was slightly frustrated.

Hispanic sculptor Isaac Kodal made a statue about 15 cm high on top of a red brick roof, a monitor and a window frame. A middle-aged man with a frustrated atmosphere, looks like Asians and whites, wears a fight, sometimes squabbling, and occasionally sees the land with his hands. Walking in Beipu's defensive building's winding streets, a monitor on the head, there is a masked villain that echoes current events, this dialogue with urban space, like a silent roar, is shocking.


Wearing a mask standing on the monitor reflects the current affairs of Hong Kong masked law.



On the vent, he twisted and could not lift his head.



On the bamboo wall, the person wearing a coat and a hat is on the head.

In the middle of the old factory in the industry, ""Chopping a tung tree"", a tung tree was hoisted high, hanging is an important basic knot in the material, after 50 years of the industry, teacher Fu Bian said that the tree in his eyes is very different from the rareness of the people in the city. The tree used to be a tool for survival, and now it is fading. He is still satisfied.


Curator Eva creates an artistic atmosphere that is elegantly hidden in the town.



In the finished material field, the tung tree was lifted in a hidden posture, as if the factory was still running.

The ""Beipu Sniffing"" between the potato and the studio was placed in the space of the Hakka traditional life through the space of the Nanpu barn creator. The smell of swelled tea, grassy taste, market plum dried vegetables, oily onion, bamboo, persimmon, eucalyptus, etc., show the taste and the atmosphere of life.


Fan Jibo woven his old barn and became part of the art season.



The barn used before and after the recovery in Taiwan can still be found in Nanpu.



10 local scent, which reflects the Hakka memories of Beipu.

James Tapscott hides Arc Zero on the Xiuyi Mountain surrounding the town of Beipu. The simple curved steel frame is introduced into the local stream, and the water mist device is sprinkled on the mountain forest. At night, it is like walking into the mountain tunnel. Real and psychedelic.


The ethereal temperament of ""Arc Zero"", like a fire circle at night, is framed in the rear of the Hakka Monument.
