中國困惑（上）：普世價值在中國不管用？
03 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 《思想坦克》


我們想讓你知道的是如果你真的有文化自信，為什麼不敢讓「西方價值」和「中國價值」在平等的言論環境下互相對話、互相競爭？表面上是中國服膺「文化封閉主義」，深層的因素恐怕是中國政府害怕人民透過反思而「再發現」西方價值的普世性因為它們根植在人性之中。



文：陳瑞麟（在學院的哲學工作者，專長是科學哲學，但是對於政治有相當關懷。在臉書上有一「陳瑞麟的科哲絮語」專頁，不定期地發表個人在各種領域探索、思考的片段文字）
美國NBA總管莫雷（Daryl Morey）在美國境內的社交軟體推特上，發表支持香港反送中運動的言論，引來中國國內的憤怒情緒。中國輿論不僅要求莫雷道歉，甚至要NBA總裁蕭華（Adam Silver）開除莫雷。
這種反應引爆了中國人民的「愛國主義」與美國人民的「言論自由」之間的衝突。從更寬廣的角度來看，這個衝突似乎反應了「中國的價值」與「西方民主國家的價值」之間的衝突。如果自由民主國家視為理所當然的自由、人權、民主等是「普世價值」、是生而為人都應該追求的基本價值，為什麼中國人民卻反對甚至敵視這些價值，反而支持中國共產黨的專制獨裁？這個問題令世人困惑，可稱為「中國困惑」。
回顧歷史，過去四十年來，中國透過台商與西方資本的投資變成世界工廠，經濟持續高速成長。貿易活動使中國與世界有大量人才與物資交流，中國每年到西方國家（特別是美國）留學的學生人數高速成長，四十年來有大量人才學成歸國。這種種現象都讓西方國家相信：或許有可能慢慢地改變中國的政治制度，和平演變中國。
然而，與世人預期和預測不同的是，中國共產黨始終拒絕走向民主制度，對國內的管制更在習近平擔任國家主席之後，走上更專制極權的方向。例如對西藏（圖博）、新疆（東土耳其斯坦）人民的壓迫，今（2019）年更迫使逾百萬香港人民站出來抗議港府政策而爆發「反送中運動」，也因此引爆了中國抵制（甚至可以說霸凌）NBA的衝突事件。
這個極簡短的回顧為「中國困惑」添加了歷史的面向：為什麼自由、人權、民主這些普世價值在中國與世界密切交流四十年來，沒有成為廣大中國人民的基本信念？
想對「中國困惑」提供一個完整的答案非常困難，因為內容可能極端複雜。有人可能認為這一切都是出於中國共產黨的意志，因為中國政府對其國內的言論與思想有嚴密的控制，使得人民不敢表達出自己真實的聲音（回顧三、四十年前，中國曾有過爭取民主現代化的北京之春、八九民運等等）；有人可能主張中國傳統文化使中國人民對於專制政權不僅容易忍受、甚至傾向支持，因此，美國NBA事件反應了真實的文化衝突；有人可能爭論中國共產黨的洗腦教育，塑造了當代中國人民的思想，把他們變成中國民族主義的後備軍等等。
這些看法都有其真實性。然而，這篇文章無法提供一個全面的答案。在此我只想討論一個意識形態的策略，即訴諸於「文化特殊性」的理論或論述。這個理論為中國共產黨的國家治理政策與全球政策，提供理論上的支持，而且至少說服一些具有思考力的知識分子或人民，因而支持中國共產黨的統治，並為中國共產黨標榜的「中國式社會主義」的「文化自信」提供心理基礎。
「文化特殊性」指的是什麼？
這個「文化特殊性」的論述是這樣的：西方國家所謂「自由、人權、民主」等等「普世價值」並不是真正的普世價值，它們只是西方特殊文化的反映、只是「西方價值」。它們之所以被稱作「普世價值」，是因為西方國家過去的政治經濟力量強大，形成西方文化霸權，並推廣到全球。因為它們只適用於西方文化，而中國有自己文化的特殊性，因此它們並不適於中國。
根據同樣的「邏輯」，一旦中國的政治經濟強大，中國自然也能推廣自己的文化和價值到全球，當全球有更多國家接受中國的文化價值時，中國的文化價值就有可能取代西方的文化價值而成為「普世價值」。但是，中國並不「稱霸」，中國不會干預或改變他國的內政與文化，他國（政府與人民）也不該對中國的內政說三道四、妄加議論。那是干涉中國內政，不尊重中國的特殊國情與文化，染黑中國形象。
什麼是「中國的文化價值」呢？中國官方特別強調的是生存權、發展權、社會和諧、穩定、愛國等等。根據一些出現在中國都市街道的標語顯示，「富強、民主、文明、和諧、自由、平等、公正、法治、愛國、敬業、誠信、友善」這十二名詞被列為「社會主義核心價值」。
說穿了，這套「文化特殊性理論」還是根源自西方，但是本文不打算追究它的來龍去脈，只想分析它的內涵、拆解它，並駁斥它的理論基礎。
支持中國「文化自信」的「文化特殊性理論」蘊涵了下列三個關於「價值」的論題：唯權力論、集體主義和價值相對主義。我在下文逐點說明其內涵並加以駁斥。

一、「價值的唯權力論」
意指價值和價值推廣的基礎就是政治權力。因此，不同價值如西方價值和中國價值之間的競爭，在本質上是權力鬥爭。從這樣的唯權力論，會推出接受一個價值沒有對或錯、合理性或不合理、正當或不正當可言。一個有更大權力支持的信念或行為，不管它的合理性是怎樣，它就是「有價值的」。
駁斥：價值的唯權力論通常是強權者「合理化」自己霸權的藉口。可是，強權者無法保證自己永遠是強權，一旦它淪為弱勢時，「唯權力論」會讓它無法指控欺凌它的其它強權是錯的、不正義的，因為強權之所在即價值之所在。
一百多年前，今日中國的前身清帝國，曾經長期淪為列強欺凌的弱者，「唯權力論」在邏輯上使中國無法控訴當年的西方或日本的帝國主義對於中國的傷害。如果今天中國堅持過去西方與日本帝國主義對中國的行為是錯的、不正義的（因為他們侵犯了中國人民的自由、生命、財產等權利），那就表示中國正訴諸於超越權力之上的客觀價值。如果這世界存在超越權力的客觀價值，就表示「唯權力論」是錯的，那麼主張所謂「普世價值」只是由於西方霸權的支撐才成為普世價值就站不住腳了。
二、「價值的相對主義」
包括有二個相關面向：第一，價值的內涵與意義是相對於文化而決定的，不同的文化內涵，會賦予同一個價值名稱不一樣的意義和標準。例如「人權」、「自由」等名稱，相對於中國和西方文化有不同的意義和標準。換言之，有中國文化意義下的人權和西方文化意義下的人權。西方國家不應該以自己文化的「人權」意義和標準，來看待中國的情況。第二，每個文化之下的成員都應該受其文化的價值系統約束，例如中國文化的成員都應該要服從中國文化價值，不應該妄圖引入其他文化的價值。
駁斥：本文先對準第二個面向。一方面，它代表一種比保守主義更極端的文化封閉主義，拒絕文化更新；另方面，它牴觸各種文化持續交流的事實。如果一個文化想要保持自己的活力，影響其它文化，採取這種價值相對主義是背道而馳，因此在手段上只能訴諸於價值的唯權力論，即透過權力來推動自己的文化價值。
另外，在全球文化持續交流的情況下，要實現這種文化封閉主義只能依賴於政治封閉。這也是為什麼中國要建立各種嚴密的監控系統，把整個中國國民封閉在官方的價值觀點下。因此，這種價值相對主義支持了中國的專制與極權政治。要拒絕專制與極權，就得拒絕這種價值的文化封閉主義。
再來，接受第一個面向等於拒絕承認「普世價值」的存在、拒絕一個價值概念可以有跨文化的客觀意義。「中國的價值相對主義」拒絕自由、人權、民主等是普世價值，要駁斥這一點，我們要進一步積極地論證自由、人權、民主等等政治價值不只是西方的，它們確實是普世的。這一點我將另文為之。
三、「價值的集體主義」
是指價值應該實現在集體之上，而不是在個人之上，因為個人唯有依賴於集體才能成就其個人，這也意謂個人的生命意義在集體意志中才能彰顯。
許多中國官方強調的「權利」如生存權、發展權、社會和諧、穩定、愛國（服從國家領導）等指的都是中國社會和整個中國的「權利」：中國（社會）需要生存、發展、和諧、穩定、國民服從國家的領導。在國家整體「權利」的實現之下，個人的生存、發展、人與人之間的和諧、生活的穩定才能得到保障，這樣的觀念也是中國推動中的「社會信用制度」背後的理論基礎。
駁斥：價值的集體主義是價值相對主義的邏輯後果，接受它也等於拒絕價值的個人主義。價值的集體主義預設「思想的集體主義」，要駁斥它，就得正面證成「個人才是集體思想的基礎」。為什麼個人是集體思想的基礎？要證成這一點，我們要求「反思」。
假設你（讀者）接受上述「價值的集體主義」各種主張時，請你反思並問你自己為什麼要接受這樣的想法？你是否可以「想像」自己拒絕這樣的想法？如果你可以想像自己能拒絕（姑不論你是否真地拒絕），你就是一個個人，你就是在個人的基礎上去接受或拒絕一個信念。
換言之，思想的接受或不接受，要依賴於能反思的個人之決定，而思想來自他人與社會，正是如此證成了「集體思想的基礎在於個人」。當然，個人的生活要依賴於社會、社群也是事實，但這樣的事實並不能拒絕「思想的個人主義」以及以之為基礎的「價值個人主義」，因為個人才是追求價值與實現價值的主體。
再者，社會與集體也能實現一個價值，然而，這是許多個人集合起來去實現一個共同追求的目的。因此，無視個人作為權利的主體，只是強調集體權利的實現（國家的發展、社會的和諧等等），卻不能保障個人權利的主張，其實是以「集體權利」為藉口來掩飾少數統治者的私人統治利益。
最後，中國政府禁止在其境內討論「普世價值」的政策（所謂「七不講」其中之一），自我駁斥了由這套「文化特殊性」所支持的「文化自信」：如果你真的有文化自信，為什麼不敢讓「西方價值」和「中國價值」在平等的言論環境下互相對話、互相競爭？表面上是中國服膺「文化封閉主義」，深層的因素恐怕是中國政府害怕人民透過反思而「再發現」西方價值的普世性因為它們根植在人性之中。這個政策也反向地證明了西方價值的普世穿透力。
中國太龐大了，任何對中國的討論，都像是瞎子摸象，這篇文章自然也不可能對於「中國困惑」提供一個完整的解答，我只能盡我所能在有限的篇幅內，為這個困惑提出一個訴諸於「文化特殊性」的論述策略，並揭示這套論述「自欺欺人」的本質。

Chinese confusion (on): Universal value does not work in China?
03 Nov 2019, 23:58 by ""Think Tank""


What we want you to know is that if you really have cultural self-confidence, why not let ""Western Value"" and ""China Value"" talk and compete with each other in an equal speech environment? On the surface, China is obedient to ""cultural closureism."" The deeper factor is that the Chinese government is afraid of the people's universality of ""rediscovering"" Western values through reflection because they are rooted in human nature.



Text: Chen Ruilin (a philosopher in the college, specializing in philosophy of science, but has a lot of concern for politics. On Facebook, there is a special page of ""Chen Ruilin's Ke Zhe"", occasionally publishing personal exploration and thinking in various fields. Fragment text)
Daryl Morey, the NBA general manager of the United States, expressed his support for the anti-send campaign in Hong Kong on social software Twitter in the United States, which led to domestic anger. Chinese public opinion not only asked Morey to apologize, but even NBA president Adam Silver expelled Morey.
This reaction has ignited the conflict between the ""patriotism"" of the Chinese people and the ""freedom of speech"" of the American people. From a broader perspective, this conflict seems to reflect the conflict between ""the value of China"" and the ""value of Western democracies."" If liberal democracy, as a matter of course, freedom, human rights, democracy, etc. are ""universal values"" and the basic values that should be pursued by human beings, why do the Chinese people oppose and even hostile these values, instead supporting the authoritarian dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party? ? This problem is confusing to the world and can be called ""Chinese confusion.""
Looking back at history, over the past four decades, China has become a world factory through the investment of Taiwanese businessmen and Western capital, and the economy continues to grow at a high speed. Trade activities have brought a lot of talents and materials exchanges between China and the world. The number of students studying in Western countries (especially the United States) has grown rapidly every year. In the past 40 years, a large number of talents have returned to China. This kind of phenomenon has made the Western countries believe that it is possible to slowly change China's political system and peacefully evolve China.
However, unlike the world's expectations and predictions, the Chinese Communist Party has always refused to move toward a democratic system. The domestic control has taken the direction of more authoritarian totalitarianism after Xi Jinping became the president of the country. For example, the oppression of the people of Tibet (Tubo) and Xinjiang (East Turkestan) has forced more than one million Hong Kong people to stand up to protest against the Hong Kong government policy in the current (2019) year and erupted into the ""reverse movement movement"", thus detonating China. Resisting (or even bullying) NBA conflicts.
This extremely brief review adds a historical dimension to ""China's confusion"": Why are the universal values of freedom, human rights, and democracy in China's close communication with the world for forty years, and have not become the basic belief of the Chinese people?
It is very difficult to provide a complete answer to ""China Confusion"" because the content can be extremely complicated. Some people may think that this is all due to the will of the Communist Party of China, because the Chinese government has strict control over its domestic rhetoric and ideas, making the people afraid to express their true voice (reviewed three or four decades ago, China once There have been Beijing Spring, the Eighth and Nine Democracy Movements, etc., which strive for democratic modernization. Some people may argue that Chinese traditional culture makes the Chinese people not only easy to endure or even support the authoritarian regime. Therefore, the US NBA incident reflects the real cultural conflict; It is possible to argue about the brainwashing education of the Communist Party of China, to shape the thinking of the contemporary Chinese people, to turn them into reserve forces for Chinese nationalism, and so on.
These views have their authenticity. However, this article does not provide a comprehensive answer. I just want to discuss an ideology strategy, that is, to resort to the theory or discourse of ""cultural particularity."" This theory provides theoretical support for the Chinese Communist Party’s national governance policy and global policy, and at least persuades some intellectuals or people with thinking, thus supporting the rule of the Communist Party of China and advertises Chinese socialism for the Chinese Communist Party. ""Cultural self-confidence"" provides a psychological foundation.
What does ""cultural particularity"" mean?
This ""cultural particularity"" is like this: Western countries' so-called ""freedom, human rights, democracy"" and other ""universal values"" are not true universal values. They are only reflections of Western special cultures, just ""Western values."" . They are called ""universal values"" because the Western countries have strong political and economic powers in the past, forming Western cultural hegemony and spreading them to the world. Because they only apply to Western culture, and China has its own cultural particularity, they are not suitable for China.
According to the same ""logic"", once China's political economy is strong, China can naturally promote its own culture and values to the world. When more countries around the world accept China's cultural values, China's cultural values may replace the West. Cultural values have become ""universal values."" However, China does not ""hegemony"". China will not interfere or change the internal affairs and culture of other countries. Other countries (governments and people) should not make irresponsible remarks about China's internal affairs. That is to interfere in China's internal affairs, not to respect China's special national conditions and culture, and to blacken China's image.
What is ""China's cultural value""? Chinese officials particularly emphasize the rights to subsistence, development, social harmony, stability, and patriotism. According to some slogans appearing in Chinese urban streets, the 12 terms “rich, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, free, equal, fair, rule of law, patriotic, dedicated, honest, and friendly” are listed as “social core values”.
To put it bluntly, this set of ""cultural particularity theory"" is rooted in the West, but this article does not intend to investigate its ins and outs, just want to analyze its connotation, dismantle it, and refute its theoretical basis.
The ""cultural particularity theory"" that supports China's ""cultural self-confidence"" contains the following three themes on ""value"": power theory, collectivism and value relativism. I will explain the meaning of it point by point and refute it.

First, ""the power of power theory""
It means that the foundation of value and value promotion is political power. Therefore, the competition between different values, such as Western values and Chinese values, is essentially a power struggle. From such a power theory, it will be introduced that accepting a value is not right or wrong, reasonable or unreasonable, just or improper. A belief or behavior with greater power, no matter what its rationality, is ""valuable.""
Refutation: The power theory of value is usually an excuse for power owners to ""rationalize"" their hegemony. However, the power can not guarantee that it will always be a powerful power. Once it becomes weak, ""power theory"" will make it impossible to accuse it of bullying its other powers is wrong, unjust, because the power is where the value lies.
More than a hundred years ago, China’s predecessor, the Qing Empire, had long been a weak person of bullying. The “power theory” logically prevented China from accusing the Western or Japanese imperialists of the same year. If China today insists that the Western and Japanese imperialist actions against China are wrong and unjust (because they violate the Chinese people’s freedom, life, property, etc.), it means that China is resorting to surpassing power. The objective value. If the world has an objective value that transcends power, it means that ""only power theory"" is wrong. Then it is untenable to claim that the so-called ""universal value"" is only universally supported by Western hegemony.
Second, ""relativity of value""
There are two related aspects: First, the connotation and meaning of value are determined relative to culture. Different cultural connotations will give different values and standards of the same value. Names such as ""human rights"" and ""freedom"" have different meanings and standards than Chinese and Western cultures. In other words, there are human rights in the sense of Chinese culture and human rights in the sense of Western culture. Western countries should not look at China's situation with the ""human rights"" meaning and standards of their own culture. Second, members of each culture should be bound by the value system of their culture. For example, members of Chinese culture should obey Chinese cultural values and should not attempt to introduce the value of other cultures.
Refutation: This article first aimed at the second aspect. On the one hand, it represents a more extreme cultural closure than conservatism, rejecting cultural renewal; on the other hand, it touches on the fact that various cultures continue to communicate. If a culture wants to maintain its own vitality and influence other cultures, it is contrary to this value relativism. Therefore, it can only resort to the value of power theory, that is, to promote its cultural value through power.
In addition, in the case of continuous exchange of global culture, the realization of such cultural closureism can only rely on political closure. This is why China has to establish a variety of strict monitoring systems to enclose the entire Chinese nation under the official value point of view. Therefore, this value relativism supports China's autocracy and totalitarian politics. To reject autocracy and totalitarianism, we must reject cultural closureism of this value.
Furthermore, accepting the first aspect is tantamount to refusing to recognize the existence of ""universal value"" and rejecting a concept of value can have cross-cultural objective meaning. ""China's value relativism"" rejects freedom, human rights, democracy, etc. is universal value. To refute this point, we must further actively demonstrate that the political values of freedom, human rights, democracy, etc. are not only Western, they are indeed universal. . I will add another article to this point.
Third, ""value collectivism""
It means that value should be realized on the collective, not on the individual, because the individual can only rely on the collective to achieve his individual, which means that the meaning of the individual's life can be manifested in the collective will.
Many Chinese authorities emphasize ""rights"" such as the right to life, development, social harmony, stability, and patriotism (subject to national leadership), etc., all refer to the ""rights"" of Chinese society and China as a whole: China (society) needs to survive, develop, Harmony, stability, and national obedience to state leadership. Under the realization of the country's overall ""rights"", the survival, development, harmony between people and the stability of life can be guaranteed. This concept is also the theoretical basis behind the ""social credit system"" promoted by China.
Refuting: the collectivism of value is the logical consequence of value relativism, and accepting it is also equal to the individualism of rejecting value. The collectivism of value, the ""collectivism of thought"", must be refuted, and it must be positively proved that ""individuals are the foundation of collective thought."" Why is the individual the basis of collective thinking? To prove this, we ask for ""reflection.""
Suppose you (the reader) accept the above-mentioned ""collectivism of value"" claims, please reflect and ask yourself why you should accept such an idea? Can you ""imagine"" yourself to reject such an idea? If you can imagine that you can refuse (whether or not you really refuse), you are an individual, and you accept or reject a belief on an individual basis.
In other words, the acceptance or disapproval of ideas depends on the decision of the individual who can reflect, and the thought comes from others and society, which is why the foundation of collective thought lies in the individual. Of course, it is a fact that an individual's life depends on society and the community, but such facts cannot reject ""individualism of thought"" and ""value individualism"" based on it, because individuals are pursuing value and realizing value. main body.
Moreover, society and the collective can also achieve a value, however, this is the purpose of many individuals to come together to achieve a common pursuit. Therefore, ignoring the individual as the subject of rights, but only emphasizing the realization of collective rights (national development, social harmony, etc.), but can not guarantee the claim of individual rights, in fact, under the pretext of ""collective rights"" to cover up a few rulers Private ruling interest.
Finally, the Chinese government bans the discussion of ""universal value"" policies in its territory (one of the so-called ""seven talks""), self-refuting the ""cultural self-confidence"" supported by this ""cultural particularity"": if you really Cultural self-confidence, why not dare to let ""Western values"" and ""Chinese values"" talk and compete with each other in an equal speech environment? On the surface, China is obedient to ""cultural closureism."" The deeper factor is that the Chinese government is afraid of the people's universality of ""rediscovering"" Western values through reflection because they are rooted in human nature. This policy also contradicts the universal penetration of Western values.
China is too big. Any discussion of China is like a scorpion. This article naturally cannot provide a complete answer to ""China's confusion."" I can only do as much as I can within a limited space. This confusion proposes a discussion strategy that appeals to ""cultural particularity"" and reveals the essence of this set of ""self-deception.""
