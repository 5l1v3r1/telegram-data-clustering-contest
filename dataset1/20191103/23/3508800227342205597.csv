想跳脫選舉迷思，得先認清「總統不是台灣最有權力的人」
03 Nov 2019, 23:59 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是2020大選不是庶民與權貴的戰爭，而是時間的戰爭——兩組候選人都不在此時此刻下思考議題與討論政策，這對台灣是有害的，而破解的方式，可能反而不在你投下的總統選票。



文：林懿平（國立台灣大學政治學系政治理論組三年級）
一、胡謅與笑罵背後的危機
韓國瑜，近幾日來網路上搜尋就可以找到無數相關新聞，且多半與他的發言相關，媒體除了持續宣揚來路不明的民調之外，似乎愛上了韓國瑜言論的荒謬性以及各界對它的回應：支持者與韓國瑜國政團隊字字講究，嘗試在這些發言中理出一個「頭緒」來，反對者與蔡英文陣營則提出資料、事實反駁與嘲諷，一時之間台灣政界唇槍舌戰，寶島政治充滿了快活的空氣。
但在這一片輕鬆之中，許多人似乎忘記了韓國瑜是總統候選人，他的支持者們也是以期望他成為總統為目標持續支持。韓國瑜也並非光說不練，他勤跑基層、四處造勢，還作出了開發支持者的努力，舉辦青年座談會。然而上述的行動與努力幾乎都激起了反效果，例如造勢場合有地方政治人物發表反同言論、青年論壇被質疑預先篩選參加者的疑雲。
在傳統的政治學理論中，韓國瑜的行為可謂自殺：中間選民理論告訴我們，政黨與政治人物若要勝選，必須要往選民意向的「中間」移動，這是兩黨制之下兩大政黨的政見、形象都逐漸接近的根本原因，美國當代的民主黨與共和黨就是最好的例證。在過去幾年之間「藍綠一樣爛」的根本原因也與這個理論脫不了關係。
大選到了，誰不要票？那麼為什麼韓國瑜會說「我不要你的票」以及在實踐上並不是特別在乎自己的形象與政見被批評？答案是韓流現象以及廣大韓粉所明顯展演出的政治忠誠。
無論從什麼角度來看，韓粉的動員力都是相當驚人的，蔡總統可能沒辦法指望自己的支持者通通出來投票，但韓國瑜可以合理的相信自己的支持者八成都會出來投票，韓粉展現出了一種對於韓國瑜以及其一切言行的不二支持，這個現象甚至反過來要脅國民黨這個百年老店，即使有所謂的「知識藍」站出來批判韓國瑜以及郭台銘的實際挑戰，韓粉依然力挺到底，逼退國民黨高層、青年力量以及最大的台灣人金主。這種奇妙的現象除了是政界奇譚之外，其實還藏有更深層的內涵，而這個內涵正是台灣社會在這次總統大選中被凸顯出來的最大危機：時間的失序。
二、2020總統大選的真正問題：過去與未來在搶食「現在」
所謂的時間秩序，其實就是過去、現在與未來的正常排列，且社會大眾對於這個秩序都有正確地理解，不會混淆。
為什麼說這是台灣社會最大的危機呢？我們只消看看韓粉們的行為與意向：唱軍歌、堅持「傳統價值」以及緬懷蔣經國等威權時代的領導者、要求政府模仿威權時期的國家統合主義、成為社會的「施惠者」，並高度期待一個領袖集中權力、帶領國家走向富強。這個腳本正是將時間秩序下的過去套用到現在與未來，並去脈絡化的相信過去的方法一定能成功，無論現在的現實條件是什麼、國際局勢有沒有改變、人們的心智與價值有沒有進步，韓國瑜的忠誠支持者們都依然相信追隨英明領袖的力量。
而他們越是這樣相信，他們就越不能忍耐現狀、越願意付出一切代價來改變現狀，即使用來替換現任的新選擇在是否「英明」仍屬可議，他們並不在乎。
而總統大選的另一端，蔡總統陣營無論是因應韓流或本身意識的選擇，也慢慢走向了這個道路，但與韓國瑜陣營不同，蔡總統及其支持者是將未來套用到現在與過去，未來的進步價值、還沒有獲得社會支持的先進思想被套用在解決現在與過去的問題之上，忽略掉保守勢力以及人民意識並未跟上的事實，甚至造成自己黨內同志與支持者的疑慮，蔡總統的許多政策與改革之所以跛腳也正是如此。
但總體而言，蔡總統的陣營在時間秩序的裂解上並沒有如同韓國瑜的支持者那般嚴重，或許也這是執政者手握較多資訊與資源使然。

時間的錯置是非常嚴重的問題，這就像是神經系統的紊亂，要動手卻動去了腳，這樣的身體遲早出意外。2020大選不是庶民與權貴的戰爭，而是時間的戰爭：今天的台灣到底要由過去決定還是由未來決定。過去決定現在，台灣在美中競爭的局面裡一定翻船，國家自主與生存也會極端危險；未來決定現在，台灣社會會在持續不斷的改革中分裂，使社會秩序與合作基礎產生不可反逆的傷害。
綜上，我們看到這次總統大選，是由兩組都不在此時此刻下思考議題與討論政策的候選人競逐政權，這對台灣是有害的，台灣雖然比上不足比下有餘，但顯見地，當今社會依然有著各式各樣的沉痾以及每天不斷發生的新問題，這些不義絕對不合理且需要改變，任何一個社會都應該以「不讓任何一個人因為自己無法改變的先天條件，而遭受不義待遇」為目標，只要還有一個案例，這個社會就不偉大、這個社會的人們就不應該滿足於現狀。
那麼對大多數台灣人來說，我們僅僅是普通的民眾，沒有強大的政治影響力，更沒有龐大的經濟力量足以撼動社會結構，我們面對這個局面還可以做什麼？還可以改變什麼？
三、想清楚，掙脫總統大選的框架
首先，容我說一句驚世駭俗的話：總統不是台灣最有權力的人。
這句話的依據為何？在正向證明之前，我們不妨反向思考，為什麼這個社會這麼看重總統的身分與能力？制度上，總統對內代表台灣社會的多數民意、對外也代表台灣的國際形象，其一言一行都在世界的舞台上被注視——考量到台灣的特殊狀況——也在國台辦與北京政府的凝視中。政治實務上，總統常兼任黨主席，實際上是政黨的領導人，政黨黨員沒有意外的話也是以黨主席及其組織是從。社會上，總統是政府的化身，雖然依據憲法這並不正確，但實務運作上透過閣揆的任免，總統一手掌握了台灣的最高行政權。
當人民看到總統或會面總統時，便合理的帶著這樣的假設與總統互動，配合上華人敬畏高官與領導的傳統性格，總統就是「最有權力的人」，然而這些都是依據，雖都反映了台灣的政治社會實際狀況，但是這些依據仔細思考卻也都站不住腳。
第一，總統並不是台灣唯一能代表民意的政府官員，代表性甚至還不如立法院，而日常的許多外交攻防靠的其實是我們廣大的外交領事人員；第二，總統雖身兼黨主席，但兩大黨依然時不時發生黨內權力鬥爭，從現在已經被淡忘的馬王政爭也可以發現，總統並不能完全操控國會，遑論根本是無黨籍與地方派系大本營的地方議會；第三，在一個現代的民主國家，官員雖然有身份保障與必要的維安保護，但事實上也僅僅是人罷了，而且似乎台灣民眾（特別是政權的反對者）也充分了解這件事，在嘴巴上和行為上並不特別給總統什麼優待。

總統既然不是最重要的，我們不妨拋開總統這個因素，重新思考四年一次的民主選舉對台灣的意義究竟為何，為何過去的選舉似乎總是令人不滿，以及在這次選舉中，對兩個候選人都充滿疑慮的人們，到底該如何行動以避免含淚投票等狀況一而再再而三的發生，並真正帶來改變。
四、在台灣投票好像「沒有用」，問題出在哪裡？
民主民主所為何物？這個問題的答案，非民主國家往往比民主國家的人民，更容易回答。因為民主國家的人們經常無法感受到自己的參政帶來任何改變，在台灣更是適切，我們批判政治人物通通都一個樣，結黨營私、僭越職權、私德不彰，且不管票怎麼投，這個狀況好像永遠無法改善。
這個狀況有兩個潛在解釋，一是台灣人民識人不明，二是台灣沒有人才。
然而，從客觀條件來說這都不成立：我們的人口排在世界的第56名、土地面積第137名，但我們的國內生產總值卻超越荷蘭、瑞典與新加玻，人類發展指數高過盧森堡、韓國、法國、西班牙。一片「彈丸之地」，靠著我們的才能與智慧，可以產出舉世聞名的奇才，我們的社會更積極公益，在危機時期對自身的社會乃至周遭國家顯示出極大的物資、資金動員能力，台灣人的素質絕對值得驕傲，但是懂考試、懂投資、懂賺錢、懂避險的台灣人，在政治上卻顯得欲振乏力，一直在含淚投票、一直在罵政府、一直在高呼台灣政治不公不義。
為什麼台灣人發展經濟、社會的智慧無法用於政治呢？關鍵在參與。
參與，我們難道不常參與嗎？參與社會運動、出門投票、看政論節目關心國家大事，這我們難道都沒有做嗎？並非沒有，但理解錯誤。雖然總統推行的國家政策好像是一切的根本，但請各位仔細思考，自己生活周遭的一景一物究竟是誰在決定？住家附近的公園有什麼設施、附近的路標何時整修、道路平整與否甚至我們所處都市的都市規劃如何分配又是誰在定奪？是國會、是政黨、是地方政府、是地方議會、是里長，這些人是如何獲得權力的？不都是民選嗎？這樣看來，政府職能不佳、昏庸誤國追根究底是誰造成的呢？是你我，是鄰里，是台灣廣大的人民。

九合一大選固然已過，大家不妨回顧一下當初投票產生的各類民意代表與首長，至今都做了些什麼？想做什麼？以及如何做？除了北高的柯市長與韓市長，2018年台灣共產生了11047名領公帑並乘載人民期待的公職人員，他們而今安在呢？有了這些認知，2020的真正重點應該已經呼之欲出。
政治不難，既不是污穢不堪的罪惡淵藪，也不是廟堂之上才能討論的神聖儀典，政治不過是生活的一個面向，而參與政治也不過就是用生活的經驗去仔細思考，在每一次選舉與代表會、意見會、公聽會之間思考你的議題順位是什麼？什麼事情對你來說是真正重要的？你期待一個怎麼樣的生活環境？你的投票有沒有忠於你的順位？投票是操之在己，而不是還人情債、服膺政黨的恐嚇或無奈的虛應故事，我們高呼要更好的生活，現在機會就在我們手中。
不把握，我們要怪誰？
如果所有的錯都是執政黨的錯，那國民黨取代民進黨、民進黨守住政權有什麼區別？我們是付出稅金供養一群小丑，還是審慎思量選出真正能代表我們意見的政府？回頭關注屬於您選區的立委候選人，當這些人迎著笑臉希望獲得您的授權，以參與國家大事，請你停止從花邊新聞以及他們的文宣中認識他們，利用您的稟賦與能力，一如思考投資股市、思考投資房產或購買房產的思維去看待政治，與親朋好友從這個角度討論政治，2020大選才真的能為台灣帶來改變，而不是只是淪為「另一場大選」而已。

If you want to get rid of the election myth, you must first recognize that ""the president is not the most powerful person in Taiwan.""
03 Nov 2019, 23:59 by readers


What we want you to know is that the 2020 election is not a war between the people and the powerful, but a war of time. The two groups of candidates are not thinking about issues and discussing policies at this moment. This is harmful to Taiwan and the way to crack it. It may not be the presidential vote you cast.



Text: Lin Yiping (third grade of political theory group, Department of Political Science, National Taiwan University)
First, the crisis behind Hu Yu and laughter
South Korea Yu, in the past few days, online search can find countless related news, and most of them are related to his speech. In addition to continuing to promote unidentified polls, the media seems to fall in love with the absurdity of Korean Yoga and various circles. Response to it: The supporters and the South Korean Yuguo government team are paying attention to the words, trying to come up with a ""headline"" in these speeches. The opponents and the Tsai English camp put forward materials, factual rebuttals and ridicules. The gun battle, Baodao politics is full of happy air.
But in this easing, many people seem to have forgotten that South Korea is a presidential candidate, and his supporters continue to support him in the hope of becoming president. South Korea’s Yu is not just saying that he is not practicing. He has worked hard at the grassroots level and has made efforts to develop supporters and hold youth symposia. However, the above actions and efforts have almost provoked counter-effects. For example, there are local political figures who publish opposite opinions, and the Youth Forum is questioned to pre-screen the participants' doubts.
In the traditional theory of political science, the behavior of Korean Yu can be described as suicide: the middle voter theory tells us that if political parties and politicians want to win, they must move to the ""middle"" of the voters' intentions. This is the two major parties under the two-party system. The fundamental reason why political views and images are gradually approaching is that the contemporary Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are the best examples. The root cause of ""blue and green is bad"" in the past few years is also irrelevant to this theory.
The election is over, who is not going to vote? So why does the Korean Yoga Association say ""I don't want your ticket"" and in practice is not particularly concerned about his image and political views being criticized? The answer is the Korean loyalty phenomenon and the political loyalty of the Korean show.
No matter from what point of view, Han Mian’s mobilization power is quite amazing. President Cai may not be able to count on his supporters to vote, but South Korea’s Yu can reasonably believe that his supporters will all vote for it. It shows a kind of support for South Korea's Yu and all its words and deeds. This phenomenon even in turn threatens the Kuomintang's century-old store. Even if there is a so-called ""knowledge blue"" to stand up and criticize the actual challenges of Korean Yu and Guo Taiming, Han Han Still working hard to defeat the top of the Kuomintang, the youth and the biggest Taiwanese gold lord. In addition to being a political figure, this wonderful phenomenon still contains deeper connotations, and this connotation is the biggest crisis that Taiwan society has highlighted in this presidential election: the disorder of time.
Second, the real problem of the 2020 presidential election: the past and the future are rushing to eat ""now""
The so-called time order is actually the normal arrangement of the past, the present and the future, and the public has a correct understanding of this order and will not be confused.
Why is this the biggest crisis in Taiwanese society? We only have to look at the behaviors and intentions of the Korean powder: singing military songs, upholding ""traditional values"" and cherishing the leaders of the authoritarian era such as Chiang Ching-kuo, asking the government to imitate the national integrationism in the period of authoritarianism, and becoming the ""beneficiary"" of society. I highly expect a leader to concentrate power and lead the country toward prosperity. This script is the application of the past in the time order to the present and the future, and the way to believe in the past will be successful, no matter what the current conditions are, whether the international situation has changed, whether people’s minds and values are there. Progressive, Korean loyal supporters still believe in following the power of wise leaders.
The more they believe, the more they can't stand the status quo and the more they are willing to pay the price to change the status quo. Even if it is still negotiable to replace the current new choices, they don't care.
At the other end of the presidential election, President Cai’s camp has slowly moved toward this path, whether it is in response to the Korean Wave or its own consciousness. However, unlike the Korean Yoga camp, President Cai and his supporters apply the future to the present and the past. The advanced value of the future and the advanced ideas that have not yet received social support are applied to solve the problems of the present and the past, ignoring the fact that the conservative forces and the people's consciousness have not kept up, and even caused their own comrades and supporters within the party. Doubt, many of President Cai’s policies and reforms are also lame.
But in general, President Chua’s camp is not as serious as the supporters of South Korea’s Yu in the cracking of the order of time, perhaps because the governors hold more information and resources.

The misplacement of time is a very serious problem. It is like a disorder of the nervous system. If you want to move your hands, you will have an accident. The 2020 election is not a war between the people and the powerful, but a war of time: whether Taiwan today is determined by the past or by the future. In the past, it was decided that Taiwan will definitely overturn the ship in the US-China competition. National autonomy and survival will also be extremely dangerous. In the future, Taiwan’s society will now split in the ongoing reforms, causing irreversible damage to the social order and cooperation foundation. .
In summary, we have seen that this presidential election is dominated by two groups of candidates who are not thinking about issues and discussing policies at this moment. This is harmful to Taiwan. Although Taiwan is more than adequate, it is obvious. Land, today's society still has all kinds of indulgences and new problems that happen every day. These unjustties are absolutely unreasonable and need to be changed. Any society should ""not allow anyone to be innate because they cannot change."" Aiming at unjust treatment, as long as there is another case, this society is not great, and people in this society should not be satisfied with the status quo.
So for most Taiwanese, we are just ordinary people, have no strong political influence, and have no huge economic power to incite social structure. What can we do in the face of this situation? What else can I change?
Third, think clearly, break the framework of the presidential election
First of all, let me say a shocking saying: The president is not the most powerful person in Taiwan.
What is the basis for this sentence? Before we can prove it, we may wish to think backwards. Why does this society value the president's identity and ability so much? Institutionally, the president’s representation on behalf of the majority of Taiwan’s society and the international image of Taiwan’s external representation are all watched on the world stage – considering the special situation of Taiwan – also in the Taiwan Affairs Office and Beijing. The government’s gaze. In political practice, the president often serves as the party chairman. In fact, it is the leader of the political party. If the party members do not have an accident, they will also follow the party chairman and his organization. In society, the president is the embodiment of the government. Although it is not correct according to the constitution, in practice, the president has mastered the highest executive power of Taiwan through the appointment and dismissal of the cabinet.
When the people see the president or meet the president, they will reasonably interact with the president with such assumptions, and cooperate with the Chinese to respect the traditional character of senior officials and leaders. The president is the ""most powerful person"", but these are the basis, although They all reflect the actual situation of Taiwan's political society, but these reasons are also untenable.
First, the president is not the only government official in Taiwan who can represent the public opinion. It is even less representative than the Legislative Yuan. Many of the daily diplomatic attacks rely on our vast number of diplomatic consular officers. Second, although the president is the party chairman, The two major parties still have power struggles within the party from time to time. From the current Mawang political struggle that has been forgotten, the president can not completely control the Congress. The public opinion is basically the local council without party membership and local faction base camp. Third, in a modern In democracies, officials have identity protection and necessary security protection, but in fact they are just people, and it seems that the Taiwanese people (especially the opponents of the regime) are fully aware of this matter, in terms of mouth and behavior. It does not give the president any special treatment.

Since the president is not the most important, we may wish to abandon the president and rethink the significance of the four-year democratic election to Taiwan. Why the past elections always seem unsatisfactory, and in this election, two The candidates are full of doubts, how to act in order to avoid the situation of tears voting and other things happen again and again, and really bring about change.
Fourth, voting in Taiwan seems to be ""useless"". Where is the problem?
What is democratic democracy? The answer to this question is that non-democratic countries tend to answer more easily than people in democracies. Because people in democracies often can't feel any change in their participation in politics, it is more appropriate in Taiwan. We criticize that politicians are all the same, and we must be party-run, private, and private, and no matter how the vote is cast, this situation It seems that it can never be improved.
There are two potential explanations for this situation. One is that the people of Taiwan are illiterate, and the other is that Taiwan has no talent.
However, this is not true from the objective conditions: our population ranks 56th in the world and 137th in the land area, but our GDP exceeds the Netherlands, Sweden and Singapore, and the human development index is higher. Luxembourg, South Korea, France, Spain. A ""projectile land"", relying on our talents and wisdom, can produce world-famous wizards. Our society is more active in public welfare, showing great material and financial mobilization capabilities to our society and even the surrounding countries during the crisis. The quality of Taiwanese people is absolutely worthy of pride, but Taiwanese who understand exams, understand investment, know how to make money, and understand how to avoid risks are politically weak and have been voting in tears, have been blaspheming the government, and have been shouting Taiwan. Political injustice.
Why can Taiwanese people develop economic and social wisdom that cannot be used for politics? The key is to participate.
Participation, don't we participate often? Do we not do it by participating in social movements, going out to vote, watching political affairs programs and caring about national events? Not without, but understand the mistake. Although the national policy promoted by the president seems to be the root of everything, please think carefully about who is going to decide what is going on in your life? What facilities are there in the park near the home, when the nearby road signs are being refurbished, whether the roads are level or not, and even how the urban planning of the city we live in is assigned? It is Congress, a political party, a local government, a local council, and a lieutenant. How do these people gain power? Not all elected? In this way, who is responsible for the poor government functions and the ruthlessness of the country? It is you, me, the neighbor, the vast majority of the people of Taiwan.

The nine-in-one election has already passed. You may wish to recall the various public opinion representatives and heads that were originally voted. What have you done so far? Want to do something? And how to do it? In addition to the Mayor of Ke Gao and the mayor of North Korea, in 2018, Taiwan produced a total of 11,047 public servants and took public officials who were expected by the people. Are they safe now? With these insights, the real focus of 2020 should already come to the fore.
Politics is not difficult. It is neither a sinful sin and a sacred ritual. It is not a sacred ritual that can be discussed on the temple. Politics is only one aspect of life. Participation in politics is just to use life experience to think carefully, in every election and What is your agenda item between the representative meeting, the opinion meeting, and the public hearing? What is really important to you? What kind of living environment do you expect? Is your vote loyal to your position? Voting is a matter of doing things, not a human debt, a threat of a party or a helpless story. We shout for a better life, and now the opportunity is in our hands.
Do not grasp, who are we to blame?
If all the mistakes are the fault of the ruling party, what difference does the Kuomintang replace the DPP and the DPP in holding the political power? Are we paying taxes to support a group of clowns, or are we carefully considering the government that really represents our opinions? Looking back at the candidates for the legislators who belong to your constituency. When these people meet your smiles and hope to gain your authorization to participate in national events, please stop knowing them from the lace news and their propaganda, and use your endowments and abilities. If you think about investing in the stock market, thinking about investing in real estate or buying real estate to look at politics, and discussing politics with friends and family from this perspective, the 2020 election will really bring change to Taiwan, not just ""another election.""
