釋字784：不只是退學，學生只要權利受侵害就可以救濟？
03 Nov 2019, 23:54 by 法操FOLLAW


我們想讓你知道的是什麼是特別權力關係？過去大法官是如何看待學校與學生的關係？釋字784之後，學生只要受有侵害就可以請求嗎？



2019年新任大法官做出的第一件大法官釋字，就是推翻過去大法官對學生與學校「特別權力關係」的解釋。其中推翻了以往僅得針對退學等影響學生身分的處分才能提起救濟的限制，認為當學生的權利因學校教育或管理等公權力措施而遭受侵害時，就可以依法提起救濟。
究竟什麼是特別權力關係？過去大法官是如何看待學校與學生的關係？釋字784之後學生只要受有侵害就可以請求嗎？
特別權力關係
「有權利，就可以救濟」是我國憲法所保障的基本權利，但有某些具備特殊身分的人，在特別權力關係的架構下，即便有權利也不得依法提起外部救濟。常見的包括軍人、公務員、學生等。
所謂的特別權力關係，指的是某些特別強調「服從」與「紀律」的身分或職業的人民，對於國家公權力有較高的服從義務。在這樣的狀況下，過去大法官解釋認為，只有在處分可能「改變」特殊「身分」，或對於該身分「權益」有「重大影響」的處分，才可以依法提起訴願或行政訴訟。
學生與學校關係的經典釋字：釋字382

一、學校為什麼是公權力機關？

公立學校是各級政府依法令設置之機構，具有機關的地位。而私立學校也是依法經教育行政主管機關許可設立，屬於授予行使公權力之教育機構，與公立學校地位相當。

二、學校的公權力權限？

他們在實施教育之範圍內，有錄取學生、確定學籍、獎懲學生、核發畢業或學位證書等權限。

三、僅限於改變學生身分才可以請求

在釋字382解釋中，大法官認為只有「足以改變其學生身分及損害其受教育之機會」的處分，例如退學，才是訴願法及行政訴訟法上的行政處分。如果學校只是基於「維持學校秩序、實現教育目的」所必要，例如記過或申誡，大法官認為，只要有學校內部申訴途徑救濟就足夠了，「尚無許其提起行政爭訟之餘地」。
釋字784之後，學生受到侵害就可以請求嗎？

一、放寬範圍，不限退學處分

大法官認為，學校所作的處分除了可能侵害學生「受教權利」外，也有可能會侵害到其他憲法的基本權，例如一般人民地位所享之身體自主權、人格發展權、言論自由、宗教自由或財產權等憲法上的權利或其他權利等。
基於憲法的訴訟權保障，若學生憲法上其他權利，因為學校的教育或管理等公權力措施而遭受侵害時，就應該可以提起相應的行政爭訟程序以為救濟，沒有特別限制的必要。

二、什麼處分都可以請求嗎？

大法官認為，還是需要個案判斷學校所作的處分，另外要整體考量學校所採取措施之目的、性質及干預程度。如果干預很輕微，就很難說構成權利的侵害。另外大法官也強調，行政法院在做相關判斷時，仍應尊重給予教師及學校的專業判斷餘地。

Interpretation 784: Not only drop out of school, students can be relieved as long as their rights are violated?
03 Nov 2019, 23:54 by Falun FOLLAW


What do we want you to know is a special power relationship? How did the judge in the past view the relationship between the school and the students? After the release of the word 784, students can request as long as they are infringed?



The first judge's interpretation by the new judge in 2019 was to overturn the previous interpretation of the ""special power relations"" between the students and the school. It overturns the restriction that in the past, only the punishment for the student's identity, such as dropping out of school, can be used to bring relief. It is considered that when the student's rights are infringed by public education measures such as school education or management, the relief can be instituted according to law.
What exactly is a special power relationship? How did the judge in the past view the relationship between the school and the students? After the release of the word 784, students can request as long as they are infringed?
Special power relationship
""There is a right to be able to remedy"" is the basic right guaranteed by our Constitution, but some people with special identities, under the framework of special power relations, may not bring external remedies according to law even if they have the right. Common people include military personnel, civil servants, and students.
The so-called special power relationship refers to people who emphasize the identity or occupation of ""obedience"" and ""discipline"" and have a higher obedience obligation to the state's public power. Under such circumstances, the Chief Justice explained that the prosecution or administrative litigation can only be instituted in accordance with the law if the disposition may ""change"" the special ""identity"" or have a ""significant influence"" on the identity ""equity"".
The classic interpretation of the relationship between students and the school: interpretation 382

1. Why is the school a public authority?

Public schools are institutions set up by governments at all levels according to law and have the status of organs. Private schools are also authorized by the administrative authority for education according to law, and are educational institutions that grant the exercise of public power, which is equivalent to the status of public schools.

Second, the school's public authority?

Within the scope of implementing education, they have the authority to enroll students, determine student status, reward and punish students, and issue graduation or degree certificates.

Third, only to change the student's identity can request

In the interpretation of Interpretation 382, the Chancellor considered that only the ""sufficient to change the identity of the student and the opportunity to harm his education"", such as dropping out of school, is the administrative punishment of the law of appeal and administrative law. If the school is only necessary to ""maintain school order and achieve educational purposes"", such as remembering or applying for a stipend, the judge thinks that as long as there is a remedy for the internal appeal of the school, ""there is no room for administrative disputes.""
After the release of the word 784, students can be requested if they are violated?

First, relax the scope, not limited to dropout points

The Chancellor believes that the penalties imposed by the school may infringe on the students' right to be taught, and may also infringe upon the fundamental rights of other constitutions, such as the body autonomy, personality development rights, freedom of speech, and religious freedom enjoyed by the general people's status. Or constitutional rights or other rights such as property rights.
If the constitutional right to sue is protected, if the student's other constitutional rights are infringed by public education measures such as education or management, then the corresponding administrative dispute procedure should be filed as relief, and there is no need for special restrictions.

Second, what can be requested?

The Chancellor believes that it is still necessary to judge the disciplinary action taken by the school and to consider the purpose, nature and degree of intervention of the measures taken by the school as a whole. If the intervention is mild, it is difficult to say the violation of rights. In addition, the Chancellor also stressed that the administrative court should still respect the professional judgment given to teachers and schools when making relevant judgments.
