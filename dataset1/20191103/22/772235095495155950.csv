Ford has revealed the logo for its upcoming Bronco, and confirmed the rough-and-ready crossover will launch in the first half of 2020.
Although speculation and spy photos have been flying, this is the first official mention of the Bronco since Ford's press conference at the Detroit motor show in January.
When it launches in the Northern Hemisphere's spring (our autumn), the 2020 Bronco will pick up a badge that's been dormant since 1996 in the USA.



The badge debuted in the 1960s, however.
Ford hasn't offered any details about the Bronco, but a number of patent filings have given us a look at what will be offered in the upcoming off-roader.
It appears the Blue Oval has been working on ways of incorporating side airbags into tubular doors, as it works to create a safe way for nostalgic off-roaders to get their open-air kicks. It's also expected to have a range of roof options, including a soft roll-top.
A report from Automotive News earlier this year claimed the Bronco will have round headlights, a rectangular grille, prominent Bronco branding and a retro design.
