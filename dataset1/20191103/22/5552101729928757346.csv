【通靈檢察官6】命案卷宗飄出神祕香水味　檢察官神感應驗屍破案
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 林俊宏, 攝影組
雖然有檢察官號稱有通靈能力，但有的檢察官雖然沒有靈異體質，卻遇上科學無法解釋的現象，例如遭判無期徒刑定讞的男子張鶴齡，13年前用乙醚迷昏妻女後殺害，過程中還用手機即時傳送「殺人實況」的聲音給情婦聽，手段至為凶殘，起訴他的檢察官林宏松當初在偵辦時，不知何故從一大堆案卷中聞到陣陣香水味，直覺死者應該不是自殺，解剖後，果然在死者體內驗出有乙醚成分。
後來林宏松率警員重回命案現場勘驗，一進門就感到寒風陣陣，檢警回家後還連拉3天肚子，當他訊問此案到半夜，清晨回家補眠時，突然聽到有女子喊叫：「起床！」當他驚醒後，刑事局就來電告知「凶嫌已承認殺人！」
擁有美國史丹福大學電機工程博士的台大前校長李嗣涔，進行20多年的特異功能研究，他在1998年出版《人身極機密：人體X檔案》、2000出版《難以置信：科學家探尋神秘信息場》以及2004年的《難以置信II：尋訪諸神的網站》，去年又出版《靈界的科學》，引起迴響。


台大前校長李嗣涔研究超自然現象，他相信有靈界及特異功能存在，還在台大開課，吸引不少學生前來聆聽。

李嗣涔認為人類所處的時空之外，有所謂的「信息場」存在，意即俗稱的「靈界」，這些超自然現象，也可解釋神佛存在。
不過，辦案講求證據，檢警查案難免遇上瓶頸，求神問卜只能做為參考；法網恢恢，疏而不漏，冥冥中自有定數，切勿心存僥倖犯罪。

[Psychic Prosecutor 6] The murder case filed a mysterious perfume. The prosecutor’s god sensed the autopsy
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Lin Junhong, Photography Group
Although prosecutors claim to have psychic abilities, some prosecutors, although not spiritually singular, encounter phenomena that science cannot explain, such as Zhang Heling, a man sentenced to life imprisonment, who was distressed with his wife 13 years ago. In the process of killing, the voice of the ""murderous live"" was immediately transmitted to the mistress by means of a mobile phone. The means was fierce. When the prosecutor Lin Hongsong sued him for the investigation, somehow he smelled the perfume from a large number of files. Intuitive death should not be suicide. After dissection, it is true that there is ether in the body of the deceased.
Later, Lin Hongsong led the police officer back to the scene of the murder. When he entered the door, he felt the cold wind burst. When the police went home, he even pulled the stomach for 3 days. When he interrogated the case until midnight, when he went home to sleep in the morning, he suddenly heard The woman shouted: ""Get up!"" When he woke up, the Criminal Bureau called to inform him that ""the murderer has admitted to killing!""
Li Wei, former president of National Taiwan University, who has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Stanford University, has conducted more than 20 years of research on specific functions. In 1998, he published ""Personal Secrets: Human X Files"", 2000, ""Unbelievable: Scientists Search Mysterious Information Fields"" and 2004 The year's ""Unbelievable II: Searching for the Sites of the Gods"", and the publication of ""Science in the Spiritual World"" last year, caused repercussions.


The former president of National Taiwan University, Li Wei, studied supernatural phenomena. He believed that there were spiritual realms and special functions. He also started classes at National Taiwan University and attracted many students to listen.

In addition to the time and space in which human beings live, Li Wei believes that there is a so-called ""information field"", which is commonly known as the ""spiritual world."" These supernatural phenomena can also explain the existence of the Buddha.
However, handling cases requires evidence, and it is inevitable that the police will encounter bottlenecks when investigating the case. Asking God to ask for a reference can only be used as a reference; the legal network is restored, not leaking, and there are certain numbers in the dark, so don't be lucky.
