【通靈檢察官3】她早上預告會有兒童命案　檢方下午就接到通報電話

知情人士說，該名女檢還有感應預知的本事，有一回她神祕兮兮地打電話到法警室說：「你們轉告今天的外勤檢察官，今天相驗會有一個小孩子。」果然當天警方回報一起兒童意外死亡，神準命中的預言，讓同仁嘖嘖稱奇。
更玄的是，桃檢之前有一名檢察官意外過世，不久後該名女檢在地檢署說「學長回來了」，甚至提到學長託她向另名男檢察官交代一些案件的後續事項，讓該名男檢察官相當訝異，因為她所說的事項，只有他跟剛過世的檢察官2人知道。


桃園地檢署日前落成啟用，通靈女檢林欣怡常向同仁稱五樓南側廁所有不少「髒東西」。

由於通靈女檢的言行異於一般檢察官，讓不信鬼神的檢察官倍感困擾，署內更盛傳她曾在書類寫了「死者證稱」等語，但科學辦案講求證據，加上死人根本不會講話，偏偏她自稱能感應到亡靈，最後該書類仍被主任要求修改。
此外，她開庭時有別於檢察官高高在上、坐在檢察官席問案，為了感應，她常坐在被告或證人旁問筆錄，曾引起對造當事人不滿，質疑檢察官偏袒，議論之聲四起。


通靈女檢林欣怡六月低調完婚，同事及長官都不知情，婚紗照可見她幸福出嫁模樣。（讀者提供）

[Psychic Prosecutor 3] She will announce a child murder case in the morning. The prosecution will receive a notification call in the afternoon.

The person familiar with the matter said that the female doctor had the ability to sense and predict. One time she called the police room secretly and said: ""You tell the field prosecutor today that there will be a child today."" The police rewarded the accidental death of a child, and the prophecy of God's righteousness made the colleagues marvel.
What is more mysterious is that a prosecutor passed away before the peach inspection. Soon after, the female doctor said in the local inspection department that ""the seniors are back"", and even mentioned that the seniors asked her to explain the follow-up cases to some other male prosecutors. The male prosecutor was quite surprised because the things she said were only known to him and the two prosecutors who had just passed away.


The Taoyuan District Inspection Office was recently commissioned. Lin Lingyi, a psychic woman, often told her colleagues that there were many ""dirty things"" in the toilet on the south side of the fifth floor.

Because the words and deeds of the psychic female prosecutors are different from the general prosecutors, and the prosecutors who do not believe in ghosts are troubled, the department is even more rumored that she wrote the words ""dead witnesses"" in the books, but the scientific case deals with evidence, plus the dead. She did not speak at all, but she claimed to be able to sense the undead. Finally, the book was still revised by the director.
In addition, when she was in court, she was different from the prosecutor and sat in the prosecutor's office. In order to sense, she often sat next to the defendant or witness to ask the transcript, which caused dissatisfaction with the founding party, questioned the prosecutor's partiality, and the voice of the argument .


The psychic female examiner Lin Xinyi was married in a low-key manner in June. Her colleagues and the chief executive did not know. The wedding photos showed her happy marriage. (provided by the reader)
