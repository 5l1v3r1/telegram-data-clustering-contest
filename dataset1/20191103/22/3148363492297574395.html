      <h1>Jimmy Carter Says He Is 'Absolutely and Completely at Ease' with Death</h1>
      <h2>Former President Jimmy Carter said Sunday during a church service in Plains, Georgia, that he “was absolutely and completely at ease with death” after doctors informed him in 2015 that his cancer had spread to his brain.</h2>

      <p>“I assumed, naturally, that I was going to die very quickly,” the 39th president said while delivering a church sermon. “I obviously prayed about it. I didn’t ask God to let me live, but I asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death.”</p>
      <p>“It didn’t really matter to me whether I died or lived,” Carter added. “Except I was going to miss my family, and miss the work at the Carter Center and miss teaching your Sunday school service sometimes and so forth. All those delightful things.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Carter experienced a fall in his Georgia home and was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/jimmy-carter-out-of-hospital-after-treatment-for-fall/">hospitalized</a>. Carter, who is the oldest living former president in U.S. history, fractured his pelvis but was treated and released by the hospital shortly after.</p>
      <p>In September, Carter strongly criticized President Donald Trump, saying it would be a “disaster” if he were to get reelected in 2020.</p>
      <p>“It would be a disaster to have four more years of Trump,” Carter said at the time. “I voted for Bernie the last time. But one of the major factors I have in my mind is who can beat Trump.”</p>
      <p>Carter’s wife, Rosalynn, also shared her thoughts on President Trump at that time and said, “I think we need a new president.”</p>
      <p>“I am so disturbed about white power. He says he is not a racist and maybe he is not,” she added of Trump. “But some of the things he says encourages racism.”</p>
