政府為提倡綠能，近年力推太陽能發電，不料卻成為不肖人士詐騙的題材。本刊接獲投訴，有詐騙集團以「太陽能種電計畫」名義，吸金逾億元，卻虛晃一招，數十名被害人發現被騙後提告，拖了近2年，檢調卻沒任何動作。
本刊日前接獲爆料，指「富柏財務顧問公司」楊大業，與太陽能公司「鼎笙國際」負責人施慶鴻合作，以舉辦免費理財講座的方式，誘騙學員投資太陽能發電廠，後來投資人發現鼎笙根本沒有建廠計畫，卻求償無門，於是成立自救會，對楊大業、施慶鴻等人提告。
3人異口同聲地告訴本刊，楊大業旗下的業務人員先叫他們以借款、貸款等方式，各自成立公司，強調用公司名義可提高貸款額度，再去和鼎笙簽約，參與時下最流行的太陽能種電計畫。楊還告訴他們，不僅有固定利息可領，還保證獲利，「投得越多，賺得越多！」

投資人事後找楊大業理論，楊卻說自己也是受害者。「我們是真的沒辦法才求助媒體，希望把真相公諸於世，讓他們不能再害人！」自救會成員並出示他們與施慶鴻簽訂的太陽能種電契約，可清楚看到電廠地址、Google空拍圖，以及計算發電、獲利與付款方式等，更在Google空拍圖上煞有其事地畫出未來太陽能板設置的規劃圖。
本刊依契約上的地址，詢問位於高雄小港的工廠，工廠人員卻回覆記者：「毫無所悉，施慶鴻或鼎笙公司並沒有跟我們談過要在屋頂上設置太陽能板的事。」

施慶鴻創立的鼎笙太陽能公司，涉嫌吸金詐騙，已遭多名被害人提告。（翻攝臉書）



多名被害人指控楊大業等人，以投資太陽能發電為由，騙取他們畢生積蓄。

本刊致電遭控吸金詐騙的鼎笙國際負責人施慶鴻，但無論是名片上的公司電話或工廠電話，皆已成空號，本刊再以臉書私訊施，至截稿前，皆未獲回應。
另一名涉案人楊大業，查無電話號碼，本刊透過臉書詢問，一樣未獲回應。
