        <b>After getting another penalty for a last-lap lunge, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> didn't hold back, as the Russian called the five-second penalty which dropped him out of the points <i>"bulls***"</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kvyat crossed the line in P10 and looked to have bagged a point, but a post-race investigation ended in a five-second time penalty for the 25-year-old, dropping him down to P12. </p>
      <p>His move on <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> in the final lap was deemed illegal, much like his move in the last lap of last weekend's Grand Prix in Mexico, when he sent it down <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a>'s inside, resulting in contact and a penalty as well.</p>

      <p> After the race, Kvyat couldn't contain his anger when quizzed about the incident by <i>Ziggo Sport</i>.</p>
