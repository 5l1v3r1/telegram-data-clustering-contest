【地表最強里長3】不知不覺從里長變成爸　沒有他的口令長輩都不敢動
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 簡竹書, 楊子磊, 林俊耀, 吳偉韶
方荷生說，做這些服務，只因為「看到了」，無法別過頭去，老人與小孩皆是，「我看到小朋友偷摩托車，還看到我兒子的同學去援交，她才小六，媽媽是大陸人，跟先生離婚後精神出狀況。」他輕輕嘆道。



開課輔咖啡屋，顧老也顧小
開辦課輔班，讓下課後沒錢補習、父母又還在打工晚下班的孩子，有地方繼續學習。他還開咖啡屋，「那幾年星巴克竄起，孩子說：『里長，我們想學咖啡，好酷喔。』你知道沖一杯咖啡對孩子吸引力多大嗎？他英文字母26個只認得13個，可是為了記咖啡豆，他26個都學會了。他們在這裡學沖咖啡、考上證照、領到薪水，穿著制服告訴大家他是認真的。」
3年前，連家樂福都點頭與方荷生合作，捐出即期品，幾家麵包店陸續加入，方荷生說，商家為了商譽，食物快到期就得下架，麵包更是大桶大桶地丟，「其實都沒壞，可以吃，只是他們不敢賣。」即期蔬果用來烹調，麵包則放進「食享冰箱」。

食享冰箱相當先進，里民插卡、人臉辨識，每日可領二樣食物，既省人力，「年輕人工作不順時，臉皮薄不敢排隊，來這裡按一下就可以拿二個麵包回家。」冰箱並無資格限制，里民皆可享用。
大概是天分，方荷生口才極佳，對「管理」更是有一套，沒進修課程無師自通，例如「老人乖寶寶牆」，又如食享冰箱，起初居民爭先恐後搶食物，「有一天我就把冰箱裡的食物通通放到垃圾袋丟掉，反正本來也是要丟掉的即期品。」二次之後，居民乖乖排隊，「他們看到有人想插隊，還會叫他排隊，說不然里長會生氣。」不同於我們想像中的好人好事代表，方荷生不走和藹可親路線，忠勤里居民都知道里長脾氣大。
老人共餐也有技巧，方荷生至今堅持每餐要收20元，月繳440元，「很多里長跟我學，又說他們比我厲害，不收費，可是最後都做不下去，因為老人會出於各種原因不來吃飯。我收20元，老人會想說『今天就算我不吃，胖子里長也不會還我20元』，他拄著柺杖都來！」
管老人像管小孩，也像帶兵，他不知不覺取代父親在社區的角色，他帶老人出遊、吃辦桌，每次活動結束，其他里的老人紛紛離場，「只有我的老人乖乖坐在原地不動，里長說可以起來才能起來，不然下次不帶他出門！」儼然軍團團長。他解釋，大型活動若所有人同時離開，容易推擠、跌倒。


方荷生擔任里長的北市忠勤里，如今每日提供的餐食多達300份，方荷生要求走得動的長者需自行來取餐或共餐，走不動才由志工送餐，以維持長輩活力。

當年，他當選里長後忙裡忙外，父親也跟著坐鎮里長辦公室協助，「每天早上小朋友看到他，都叫他『里長爺爺』，他覺得自己好有用。」但沒幾年，父親在2004年忽然病逝。
「我到現在還是很難過。當年我媽媽走掉，很多人幫爸爸介紹女人再婚，但他一直沒再娶，怕後母對我們不好。也有很多人想領養我四弟、五弟，我爸爸都拒絕，他靠打棉被、修鞋、修傘，一天工作12小時養大我們，我們家才沒有散掉。」他說，五兄弟至今感情極好，例如四弟後來是點心師父，退休後現在就在忠勤里的共餐廚房當主廚。
　
報總統文化獎，只為一百萬
方荷生的咖啡屋有一隻漂亮的橘貓，平日嗓門大、講話直的他，抱起貓整個人就變了樣，一副貓奴爸爸。他說，曾找寵物溝通師，才知道「牠說我是爺爺」，說得氣噗噗。
這天他抱完貓後，談起父親當年打棉被，「我現在睡的棉被就是我爸爸打的，超過30年，我沒換，多套一層被單。社區很多老奶奶蓋的棉被也都是我爸爸打的，用到現在，所以我對社區長輩特別有感情。」
老爺爺、老奶奶們在方家最艱辛時送餐送飯、買棉被，又在方荷生人生最低潮時，選他當里長。他說，今年報名「總統文化獎」，原因無他，「聽說獎金有100萬元，拚拚看，100萬我可以做好多事！」

[The strongest surface of the surface 3] Unconsciously changed from a long to a dad without his password, the elders dare not move
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Jian Zhushu, Yang Zilei, Lin Junyao, Wu Weiwei
Fang Hesheng said that these services are only because ""seeing"", can't go too far, old people and children are, ""I saw children stealing motorcycles, and I saw my son's classmates to help, she is only six, mother. It’s a mainlander, and he’s in a state of divorce after he’s divorced,” he sighed softly.



Start a supplementary coffee house, Gu Lao also cares
The class is set up to allow children who have no money to remedial after class, and whose parents are still working late in the evening. There is a place to continue studying. He also opened a coffee house. ""In those years, Starbucks picked up. The child said, ""Li Chang, we want to learn coffee, it’s so cool."" Do you know how attractive a cup of coffee is to children? His only 26 letters are recognized. Thirteen, but in order to remember coffee beans, he has learned 26. They are here to learn coffee, get a license, get a salary, and wear a uniform to tell everyone that he is serious.""
Three years ago, even Carrefour nodded and cooperated with Fang Hesheng to donate the spot products. Several bakeries joined in succession. Fang Hesheng said that for the goodwill of the merchants, the food would soon be put off the shelf and the bread would be lost in large barrels. ""In fact, it's not bad, you can eat, but they don't dare to sell it."" The instant fruits and vegetables are used for cooking, and the bread is placed in the ""food refrigerator.""

The food enjoyment refrigerator is quite advanced. The people can insert cards and face recognition. They can receive two kinds of foods every day, which saves manpower. ""When young people don't work well, they don't dare to line up. You can take two breads by clicking here. Go home."" The refrigerator is not eligible for restrictions and can be enjoyed by the public.
Probably talent, Fang Hesheng is very good. There is a set of ""management"". There is no teacher training course. For example, ""the old man licks the baby wall"", and if you enjoy the refrigerator, the residents will rush to grab food at first. ""One day."" I put the food in the refrigerator and put it in the garbage bag and throw it away. Anyway, I was also the one that I had to throw away."" After the second time, the residents lined up. ""They saw someone wanting to jump in the queue, and they would also ask him to line up, or else Long will be angry."" Unlike the good deeds of our imaginary, Fang Hesheng does not take the path of amiable, and the residents of Zhongqin know that they have a long temper.
The elderly also have skills in sharing meals. Fang Hesheng has insisted on paying 20 yuan per meal and paying 440 yuan per month. ""Many of the lieutenants learned from me, and they said that they are better than me, no charge, but they can’t do it in the end because the old people will I don’t come to eat for various reasons. I will charge 20 yuan, and the old man will want to say, “If I don’t eat today, the fat man won’t pay me 20 yuan.” He came with a cane!”
The old man is like a child, and he is like a soldier. He unwittingly replaces his father’s role in the community. He takes the elderly to go out and eat and run the table. At the end of each activity, the old people in the rest have left. ""Only my old man Sitting still in the field, the long said that you can get up, or you will not take him out next time!"" He explained that large events can easily push and fall if everyone leaves at the same time.


Fang Hesheng served as Li Zhong’s Zhongqin Li, and now offers up to 300 meals a day. Fang Hesheng’s elders who want to move must take their own meals or share meals. They can’t wait until they are delivered by volunteers to maintain their elders. vitality.

At that time, he was busy after he was elected to the lieutenant. His father also followed the office of the long-term office to help. ""Every morning, the children saw him and called him ""the grandfather,"" he thought he was very useful."" But in a few years, the father Suddenly died in 2004.
""I still feel very sad until now. When my mother left, many people helped Dad introduce women to remarry, but he has never been jealous again, fearing that her stepmother is not good for us. There are also many people who want to adopt my four brothers and five brothers. Dad refused. He relied on quilts, shoes, and umbrellas. He worked for 12 hours a day to raise us. Our family did not disperse."" He said that the five brothers have had very good feelings, such as the fourth brother, who later became a snack master. After retirement, I am now a chef in the kitchen of Zhongqin.

Reported Presidential Culture Award, only one million
Fang Hesheng's coffee house has a beautiful orange cat. He is a big man who speaks loudly and speaks straight. He picks up the cat and the whole person changes. A cat slave father. He said that when he was looking for a pet communicator, he knew that ""it said that I am a grandfather"" and he was discouraged.
After he had finished the cat this day, he talked about his father playing quilts. ""The quilt I am sleeping now is my father. For more than 30 years, I have not changed, and I have a layer of quilt. The quilts covered by many old grandmothers in the community are also It’s all my father’s playing, I use it now, so I have a lot of feelings for the community elders.”
Old grandfathers and grandmothers sent meals and quilts when they were in the most difficult time. When Fang Hesheng had the lowest tide in life, he chose him to be a lieutenant. He said that this year's registration of the ""Presidential Culture Award"" has no reason for him. ""I heard that there is 1 million yuan in bonuses. I can try to figure it out. I can do a lot of things for 1 million!""
