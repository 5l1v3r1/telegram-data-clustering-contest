      <p>We know how amazingly hard our NHS staff work but the strain they face due to Tory cuts is immense.</p>
      <p>We lack the nurses to properly care for patients while Tory NHS pension changes are driving out doctors or forcing them to cut their shifts.</p>
      <p>Budgets for repairs have been slashed and social care support savaged, causing yet more misery for patients.</p>
      <p>Today official statistics show waiting lists are at record levels, the numbers waiting longer than 18 weeks for treatment are over 660,000.</p>

      <p>Shamefully cancer patients are cruelly failed.</p>
      <p>When you need treatment, you need it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>In the past year over 32,000 patients waited beyond two months.</p>
      <p>Staff are warning about the coming winter.</p>
      <p>Last winter over 215,000 patents were stranded on trolleys, doctors are warning this winter it will be 300,000.</p>
      <p>This is what happens when the Tories cut over 15,000 beds.</p>
      <p>Ensuring cancer patients are given lifesaving treatment needed will be a Labour priority.</p>
      <p>We’ll fund our NHS properly and recruit more staff.</p>
