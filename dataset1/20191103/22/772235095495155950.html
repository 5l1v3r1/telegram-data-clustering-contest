      <p><b>Ford</b> has revealed the logo for its upcoming <b>Bronco,</b> and confirmed the rough-and-ready crossover will launch in the <b>first half of 2020</b>.</p>
      <p>Although speculation and spy photos have been flying, this is the first official mention of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/ford-bronco/">the Bronco</a> since <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/">Ford's</a> press conference at the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/detroit-motor-show/">Detroit motor show</a> in January.</p>
      <p>When it launches in the Northern Hemisphere's spring (our autumn), the 2020 Bronco will pick up a badge that's been dormant since 1996 in the USA.</p>

      <p>The badge debuted in the 1960s, however.</p>
      <p>Ford hasn't offered any details about the Bronco, but a number of patent filings have given us a look at what will be offered in the upcoming off-roader.</p>
      <p>It appears the Blue Oval has been working on ways of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/786823/2021-ford-bronco-patents-hint-at-removable-doors/">incorporating side airbags into tubular doors</a>, as it works to create a safe way for nostalgic off-roaders to get their open-air kicks. It's also expected to have a range of roof options, including a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/742363/ford-bronco-canvas-roll-top-roof/">soft roll-top</a>.</p>
      <p>A report from <i><a href="https://www.autonews.com/sales/dealers-get-glimpse-bronco-prototype">Automotive News</a> </i>earlier this year claimed the Bronco will have round headlights, a rectangular grille, prominent Bronco branding and a retro design.</p>
