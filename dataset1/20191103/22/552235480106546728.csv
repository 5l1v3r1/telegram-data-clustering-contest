Ford Kiernan says he is “chuffed to bits” after he and his Still Game co-creator Greg Hemphill were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Television award at the Scottish Baftas on Sunday night.
The long-running sitcom ended this year with a run of live shows at Glasgow’s Hydro more than two decades after curmudgeonly pensioner pals Jack and Victor, played by Ford and Greg, first hit our screens.

Ford said: “It’s been 21 years, it’s been ages – it just means a lot to finally get that sort of recognition at the end.
“We’ve had a couple of Baftas before – oh yes – but we’re chuffed to bits to be picking this up tonight. It’s obviously the work of a whole lot of people.”
Gavin Mitchell, who played Boaby the Barman in the comedy, said: “We’re very chuffed – it’s the icing on our cake after filming the final series and after the Hydro – 51 shows all in all. It feels like the perfect conclusion.
