      <h1>US white supremacist arrested hours before far-right conference in Norway</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:58:06+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Peter Stubley</a></address>
      <p>An American <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/white-supremacist">white supremacist</a> was arrested hours before he was due to speak at an international far-right conference in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Norway">Norway</a>.</p>
      <p>Greg Johnson was detained under immigration law on the basis that he posed a threat to national interests, according to the police security agency PST.</p>
      <p>“He stands for and communicates an extreme right-wing ideology,” PST spokesman Martin Bernsen said. “There’s a danger that it can result in violence.”</p>
      <p>The authorities are now seeking to deport him back to the US later this week.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, who runs the alt-right organisation Counter-Currents Publishing, was scheduled to take part in the Scandza Forum, a far-right network known for its anti-Semitic and racist views.</p>
      <p>He has called for white-only states and once claimed that ‘”excessive kindness” was “Hitler’s greatest flaw”, according to the anti-racism campaign group <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hope-not-hate">HOPE not hate</a>.</p>
      <p>Before heading to the conference in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Oslo">Oslo</a>, he complained that the Norwegian website Filter Nyheter was “agitating to stop my entry” by claiming he had expressed support for the far-right terrorist <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/anders-breivik">Anders Breivik</a>.</p>
      <p>“I have always consistently condemned violence and terrorism,” he wrote on his website, before suggesting that his writings about Breivik had been “taken out of context”.</p>
      <p>He added: “In fact, it was a text that discussed Breivik’s own rationale for the crime."</p>
      <p>One of the other speakers at the event was listed as Edward Dutton, a British academic who has written about racial differences.</p>
      <p>Mr Bernsen said that the PST was working “to keep this milieu as small as possible”. He told<i> Aftenposten: </i>“It’s important to stop those trying to radicalise others to a more extreme direction.”</p>
      <p>Around 50 demonstrators protested against the Scandza Forum conference in the Norwegian capital on Saturday, chanting: “No racism in our streets.”</p>
