McDonald's fires CEO over consensual relationship with employee
03 Nov 2019, 22:25 by Tim Pearce
McDonald's Corp. has fired CEO Steve Easterbrook for engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee.
The McDonald’s board voted on Friday to oust Easterbrook, 52, after conducting an internal investigation into the relationship and announced their decision Sunday. Easterbrook also resigned his spot on the board, according to the Wall Street Journal. The employee who was involved with Easterbrook was not named.
""This was a mistake,"" Mr. Easterbrook told the Wall Street Journal. ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.""
He added that his actions violated company policy. Easterbrook was named CEO of McDonald’s in 2015. He will be replaced by USA President Chris Kempczinski.
Under Easterbrook's direction, McDonald’s sacrificed some profits to update and improve stores with digital kiosks and food items and ingredients that are more healthy and fresh. Kempczinski, 51, has pledged to stick with the vision outlined by Easterbrook.
""There isn't going to be some radical, strategic shift. The plan is working,"" Kempczinski said on Sunday.
