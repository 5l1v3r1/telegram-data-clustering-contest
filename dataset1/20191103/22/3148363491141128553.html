      <h2>A father in Buffalo, New York, is being praised by his adopted son for his decision to adopt five young siblings at once.</h2>

      <p>Michael Perez, who now works as a nurse, was the first young man 48-year-old Lamont Thomas took in as a foster child in 2001. Not long after he came to live with Thomas, the divorced father of two decided to adopt him.</p>
      <p>Over the next fifteen years, the single dad <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/single-dad-adopts-5-siblings-after-years-of-fostering-2019-11-01/">fostered</a> more than thirty kids and adopted five more.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe that I would be the person that I am today without the morals that he instilled in me, the extended family that I have now,” Perez told CBS News’s Steve Hartman.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Thomas recently <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/local/2019/10/18/single-dad-adopts-five-siblings-at-once-to-keep-them-together/">adopted</a> five siblings all under the age of 6 after fighting for two years in court to keep them together.</p>
      <p>“I want to be the difference; make a difference by being a difference for these youths,” he said after the adoption was made final on October 17.</p>
      <p>Perez said when he found out about his dad’s plans to make the children his own, he was stunned.</p>
      <p>“It really was a shocker. I didn’t expect for him to restart and to do it all over again. It’s just amazing,” he commented.</p>
      <p>Thomas <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/single-father-adopts-5-siblings-under-5/">said</a> his long career as a foster parent began when he decided to help a couple who happened to be Perez’s parents.</p>
      <p>“In the beginning, I was helping out some friends. They had lost their child to the system. I went on and got certified and became a foster parent. I haven’t stopped since,” he recalled.</p>
      <p>Perez <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/single-dad-fostered-30-kids-adopts-siblings-years-66499941">said</a> he is grateful to Thomas for making sure he was cared for during such an uncertain time in his life.</p>
      <p>“He was my third foster home and it ended up being my forever home,” he stated. “He [knew] my biological parents. Lamont never turned [a child] away. They either aged out or went back home to their own families.”</p>
      <p>Although the five siblings will be a challenge, Thomas knew he had to do everything in his power to keep them together.</p>
      <p>“Every child that I have had, it was my goal to make a difference in their lives,” he said, adding “I had to help them. They deserved to be raised together.”</p>
