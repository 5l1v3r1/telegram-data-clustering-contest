      <p>Ariana Grande has been snubbed at the MTV Europe Music Awards after failing to win a single prize, despite being nominated in seven categories.</p>
      <p>The Grammy award-winning US pop star, who did not attend the event, was among the big losers on the night, alongside Lil Nas X who was nominated in six categories but also went home empty handed.</p>
      <p>Billie Eilish, however, took home two gongs, for best song and best newcomer, blowing her fans a kiss in a brief pre-recorded video message.</p>

      <p>K-pop superstars BTS, who were not at the event, also scored a double win for best live and biggest fans.</p>
      <p>The night was also marked by a performance from NCT 127.</p>
      <p>The K-pop boy band became the first from the Korean genre to appear at the annual event, this year held at the FIBES Conference and Exhibition Centre in Seville, Spain.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift, hot from the release of her seventh album Lover, and Halsey were also handed two awards.</p>

      <p>The star-studded event featured an impressive roster of performances from the likes of Halsey, Mabel and Spanish singer Rosalia.</p>
      <p>The event is returning to Spain for a fourth time after visiting Barcelona in 2002, Madrid in 2010 and Bilbao in 2018.</p>
      <p>Dua Lipa kicked off the night with a high-intensity performance of her new single Don’t Start Now.</p>

      <p>The British star was joined by a troupe of dancers clad in white body-suits as she sung the disco-tinged track, from her forthcoming untitled album.</p>
      <p>Lipa, 24, later sat next to her boyfriend Anwar Hadid, 20, the younger brother of models Bella and Gigi.</p>
      <p>The pair have been together since Lipa’s reported split from her former partner, chef Isaac Carew, earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Liam Gallagher also made an appearance to collect the inaugural rock icon award.</p>
      <p>In his inimitable style, the former Oasis singer told the crowd: “I was here last year. I want to recognise MTV for recognising my brilliance.”</p>
      <p>He then closed out the evening with a two-song set including the Oasis track Wonderwall.</p>
