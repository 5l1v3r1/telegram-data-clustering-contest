      <h1>The Rangers star Steven Gerrard described as 'a man possessed' in League Cup triumph over Hearts</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss was particularly impressed with one of his stars.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:29:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard described <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> as "a man possessed" after a star turn in the League Cup win over Hearts.</p>
      <p>The Scotland midfielder has been one of the key men for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> this season and was impressive again as they set up a Betfred Cup final with Celtic next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> grabbed the headlines with two goals and an assist, but the Gers manager was also struck by Jack's performance.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: "It felt ever so different on the side today knowing you have a number nine who is in terrific form and another number nine behind you who is capable on this stage.</p>

      <p>“We had great back-up and you can also see why we paid the money for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-kent">Ryan Kent</a> and were so desperate to get him in. He hasn’t played much over the past five months, so he’ll get better and better.</p>
      <p>“The midfield were outstanding, they controlled the whole game. Ryan Jack was like a man possessed again. Defensively, we were solid, so I’m very happy with how all departments of the team worked today.”</p>
      <p>Jack joined Rangers in the summer of 2017, having left Aberdeen at the end of his contract.</p>
