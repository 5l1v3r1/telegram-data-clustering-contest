談判獲「巨大進展」？白宮高官對貿易協議樂觀

03 Nov 2019, 22:31

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】智利取消主辦亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）峰會後，外界關注原定在這次峰會上簽署的美中第一階段貿易協議會否因此生變。最近兩天，美國商務部長羅斯和白宮經濟顧問庫德洛先後對媒體表示，美中談判雙方在多項領域取得了很大進展，他們都對美中在近期正式簽署首階段協議表示持樂觀態度。
正在曼谷訪問的美國商務部長羅斯（Wilbur Ross）週日（11月3日）在接受彭博電視台訪問時表示，自己對美中在月內達成第一階段協議持樂觀態度，而商務部對於美國公司提出的華為禁令豁免申請也即將批出。
羅斯透露，智利決定取消主辦峰會後，美中兩國政府正致力於另覓可以簽署首階段貿易協議的場地，美國艾奧瓦州、阿拉斯加州、夏威夷和中國城市均在考慮之列。他表示，目前談判正在取得良好進展，他本人對於美中簽署這份協議持樂觀態度。
羅斯表示，華府正在確保協議雙方都對各自同意的事宜有「非常正確、清楚和詳細的了解」。他指，目前正在取得良好的進展，沒有理由質疑美中不能簽署這份協議。不過，他同時也表示，還是不能排除以後又「出現偏差」的可能。
羅斯接着還表示，其他階段的貿易協議，將取決於中方的相關立法事宜和執行機制，如果沒有執行機制，協議將「只是一疊紙張」。
對於華為禁令豁免許可即將於11月19日到期的問題，羅斯透露，商務部已收到260宗有關華為禁令的豁免申請，即將會批出有關的許可證。
此前，白宮經濟顧問庫德洛11月1日也曾在白宮外告訴媒體，美國貿易代表萊特希澤、財政部長姆努欽和中國副總理劉鶴正在繼續敲定「第一階段」貿易協議，而雙方當前的氣氛「很積極的，很有建設性」。
他表示，中共商務部、外交部、財政部等各部委對達成這份協議的評論一直都「很積極」並「具有建設性」，這與他在談判現場所了解的情況一致。
「是的，他們將討論全部的問題。我的意思是說所有的。」 庫德洛接著說：「 協議還沒有完成，但是我們取得了巨大的進展。我們現在已經超出了我們在今年春天時的進展，所以我要從樂觀的角度來看。」
美國貿易代表辦公室在同一天發表了一份聲明說，美國貿易代表萊特希澤、財政部長姆努欽當天與中國副總理劉鶴就一項臨時貿易協議通了電話，「他們在多項領域取得了進展，目前正在解決未決問題的過程中。討論將在副手級繼續進行。」

Negotiations have been ""great progress""? Senior White House officials are optimistic about trade agreements

03 Nov 2019, 22:31

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] After Chile canceled the hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the outside world was concerned about whether the first-stage US-China trade agreement originally signed at the summit would change. In the past two days, US Secretary of Commerce Ross and White House economic adviser Kudlow have told the media that the US-China negotiating parties have made great progress in various fields. They are all optimistic that the US and China will formally sign the first phase agreement in the near future.
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who is on a visit to Bangkok, said on Sunday (November 3) that he was optimistic that the US and China will reach the first phase of the agreement within the month, while the US Department of Commerce is optimistic about the US company. The proposed Huawei ban exemption application will also be awarded soon.
Ross revealed that after Chile decided to cancel the host summit, the US and Chinese governments are working on another venue that can sign the first-stage trade agreement, and Iowa, Alaska, Hawaii and Chinese cities are considering. He said that the negotiations are currently making good progress and he is optimistic about the US-China agreement.
Ross said that Washington is ensuring that both parties to the agreement have ""very correct, clear and detailed understanding of their respective consents."" He pointed out that good progress is currently being made and there is no reason to doubt that the United States and China cannot sign this agreement. However, he also said that it is still impossible to rule out the possibility of ""deviation"" in the future.
Ross went on to say that the trade agreements at other stages will depend on the relevant legislative issues and enforcement mechanisms of the Chinese side. If there is no enforcement mechanism, the agreement will be ""just a stack of papers.""
Regarding the issue that the Huawei ban exemption is about to expire on November 19, Ross revealed that the Ministry of Commerce has received 260 applications for waiving of the ban, that is, the relevant license will be granted.
Earlier, White House economic adviser Kudlow told the media outside the White House on November 1. US Trade Representative Wright Heze, Finance Minister Mnuchin and Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He are continuing to finalize the ""first phase"" trade agreement. The current atmosphere between the two sides is ""very positive and constructive.""
He said that the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and other ministries have been ""very positive"" and ""constructive"" in reaching this agreement, which is consistent with what he learned at the negotiation site.
""Yes, they will discuss all the questions. I mean to say everything."" Kudlow continued: ""The agreement has not been completed, but we have made great progress. We are now beyond our spring this year. Progress, so I have to look at it from an optimistic perspective.""
On the same day, the Office of the US Trade Representative issued a statement saying that US Trade Representative Wright Heze and Finance Minister Munuchin had a phone call with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu He on a temporary trade agreement. ""They have achieved in various fields. Progress is currently in the process of resolving outstanding issues. The discussion will continue at the deputy level.""
