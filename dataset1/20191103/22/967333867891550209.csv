'How About Tehran?' Netizens Advise Michelle Obama Where to Host Barack’s Presidential Library

03 Nov 2019, 22:01


While Michelle Obama argued that there’s plenty of places around the world which would’ve been eager to host the Obama Presidential Center, many social media users either seemed reluctant to agree with her or offered the ex-FLOTUS some sarcastic suggestions.

Former First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama has apparently managed to stir quite a ruckus online as she boasted about the alleged popularity of her husband, the 44th President of the United States Barack Obama.
Speaking at the Obama Foundation Summit at the Illinois Institute of Technology earlier this week, Michelle revealed that Chicago's Jackson Park was selected as the location for the Obama Presidential Center due to its proximity to both her childhood home and to the couple’s old home, adding that, in theory, it probably could’ve been opened elsewhere.



""Barack’s presidential library could’ve been anywhere in the world, because there’s so many people who feel like he’s their president"", she claimed. ""New York wanted it. Hawaii wants it. Because it’s also an economic engine, because it will be a visited presidential library"".
Many social media users, however, did not seem amused by her remarks.












​A number of people also gave the ex-FLOTUS some suggestions about where Barack’s library might’ve been opened instead of Chicago.















The Barack Obama Presidential Library is expected to become the first fully digital presidential library.
