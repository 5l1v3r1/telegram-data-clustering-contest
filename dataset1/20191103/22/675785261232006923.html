      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:11:47+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Former Oasis rocker <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> cut short his acceptance speech at the MTV European Music Awards in Seville this evening.</p>
      <p>Liam, sporting his classic parka, strolled off stage after seeming like he ran out of things to say.</p>
      <p>Hopping up onto the stage alongside host Becky G, he accepted the Rock Icon Award, becoming its first ever recipient.</p>
      <p>"Thank you, man," he told the cheering crowds, "I won't keep you too long.</p>
      <p>"I wanna congratulate Seville for having a great city."</p>
      <p>Drawing cheers from the locals, he later added: "I also want to congratulate MTV for recognising my brilliance."</p>
      <p>He closed his speech with: "Thanks for the award, I'll wear it well."</p>

      <p>Liam turned on his heel and wandered off the stage.</p>
      <p>Later, he finished the night with a performance of a new track, which led into the Oasis smash hit Wonderwall.</p>
      <p>He was introduced with a montage of clips and photos from his musical career up to that point, including his Oasis days and his fallout with brother, Noel.</p>
      <p>Their feud's become the stuff of legend, as both sides still refuse to budge more than ten years on from the end of Oasis.</p>

      <p>They were known for their clashes during the band's heyday in the nineties, but a 2009 confrontation proved too much and the brothers called it quits on their joint ambitions.</p>
      <p>He shared how the bitterness has affected his mum, saying: "If, God forbid, something happens to my mam, and we haven't made up by then, then there will be war, because there's been so many opportunities on his behalf.</p>
      <p>"It's not about getting the band back together, I'm not arsed about that. It's just about going, 'Look, let's go for a beer, let's have a chat or whatever.'</p>
      <p>"And obviously I say s**t in the press and he says stuff, and his missus says something and I say something and it's all childish and we should all grow up and all that, but at the end of the day, basically it's down to him, you know what I mean?"</p>
