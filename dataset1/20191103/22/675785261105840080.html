      <h1>Man City suffer injury blow as captain David Silva ruled out of Liverpool showdown</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish playmaker picked up an injury in the win over Southampton and won't feature at Anfield next week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-silva">David Silva</a> is out of Manchester City’s title showdown with Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>City’s captain suffered a muscular injury in the first-half of Saturday’s 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> and has been ruled out of the potential title race-defining trip to Anfield.</p>
      <p>The loss of Silva, 33, is a major blow to City and boss Pep Guardiola, for whom the cultured playmaker is such an influential player.</p>
      <p>Silva - in his last season with City - will also miss Wednesday’s Champions League tie away to Atalanta, but it is the loss of him for the Liverpool clash that will hurt the champions most.</p>

      <p>Asked if Silva will be fit to face Liverpool, Guardiola said: “I don’t think so.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t speak with the doctor, but when he has a muscular problem and cannot play more minutes, it’s because he has something.</p>
      <p>“When it’s a muscular problem, it’s always a minimum of 10 to 12 days.</p>
      <p>“Five minutes before the first-half ended, he told me he had a muscular problem.”</p>

      <p>Kyle Walker set up the equaliser and scored City’s 86th-minute winner to ensure Guardiola’s side did not fall further behind Jurgen Klopp’s men ahead of their meeting.</p>
      <p>“We had most of the ball possession and caused their keeper lots of problems,” said Walker.</p>
      <p>“The key was our patience and persistence, also being positive. Luckily, I was there at the right time.</p>
      <p>“There are still so many games to play in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, a lot of people talk about the title race, but anything can happen in football.”</p>
