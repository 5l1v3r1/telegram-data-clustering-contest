【綠能大騙局4】遭質疑當詐騙集團門神　蘇煥智：絕不可能
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 社會組, 攝影組
自救會成員告訴本刊，聽說楊大業、施慶鴻等人在黑白兩道關係頗佳，才沒有單位敢辦。「甚至連前台南縣長蘇煥智都幫施打官司，還寄存證信函給我們，讓我們大家都很緊張。」自救會成員質疑，蘇煥智可能是詐騙集團的門神。
自救會成員表示：「對司法沒有任何信心！」原來，這些被害人從2017年開始，就陸續向調查局新北市調處、台北市調處等單位，對楊大業、施慶鴻等人提出詐欺、違反《銀行法》等刑事告訴，但是拖了快2年，卻毫無進展。
為了要釐清真相，本刊訪問蘇煥智，他強調：「絕對不可能！」並說，他雖然有接施慶鴻的訴訟委託，但當時他正在台南選市長，所以是由事務所其他的律師處理此案。

他說，當初之所以會接受委任，是因施的母親前來拜託，聲稱施遭受暴力威脅，找遍所有律師都沒有人敢接此案，「總不能眼睜睜看著有人生命受威脅，還不過問吧？」
蘇煥智強調，因為當時有人對施慶鴻施暴，才會寄存證信函給這些投資人，希望釐清投資人們是否與這起暴力事件有關。他說：「施開庭時，也有不明男子在門口等候，連我們事務所的律師也倍感壓力。」


蘇煥智強調不可能干預司法，自己絕非詐騙集團門神。

至於債務部分，蘇煥智表示，並沒有接到施慶鴻委託，也不清楚施慶鴻、楊大業及投資人3方的債務關係到底為何？只聽說富柏向施收取過高的佣金，最後才會產生糾紛，他除了幫施慶鴻對施暴者提告恐嚇、強制外，其他的部分完全沒插手。

[Green Energy Big Scam 4] was questioned as a fraudulent group door god Su Huanzhi: It is impossible
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Social Group, Photography Group
Members of the self-rescue meeting told this magazine that I heard that Yang Daye, Shi Qinghong and others had a good relationship between black and white, and no unit dared to do it. ""Even even the front county magistrate Su Huanzhi has helped to fight the lawsuit, and also sent us a letter to us, so that we are all very nervous."" Self-rescue members questioned that Su Huanzhi may be the door of the fraud group.
Self-rescue members said: ""There is no confidence in the administration of justice!"" Originally, these victims have been arbitrarily arbitrarily detained to Yang Daye, Shi Qinghong and others in violation of the Banking Law since the beginning of 2017. ""The criminal told me, but it has been dragging on for two years, but there is no progress.
In order to clarify the truth, the journal visited Su Huanzhi. He stressed: ""It is absolutely impossible!"" He said that although he had the entrustment of Shi Qinghong, he was elected as the mayor in Tainan, so the lawyers of the firm handled the case. .


Many of the victims of the solar investment case received a letter of deposit from Su Huanzhi Law Firm. (provided by the reader)

He said that the reason why the appointment was accepted was because Shi’s mother came to ask for it and claimed that he was threatened with violence. No lawyers dared to pick up the case. “You can’t watch the life threatened, but Just ask?""
Su Huanzhi stressed that because some people were violently attacking Shi Qinghong at that time, they would deposit certificates to these investors, hoping to clarify whether investors are related to this violent incident. He said: ""When the court was opened, there were also unidentified men waiting at the door, and even the lawyers of our firm were under pressure.""


Su Huanzhi stressed that it is impossible to intervene in the judiciary, and he is not a fraudulent group.

As for the debt component, Su Huanzhi said that he did not receive the commission from Shi Qinghong, and he did not know the debt relationship between Shi Qinghong, Yang Daye and the investors. I only heard that Fubai had charged too much commission to Shi, and finally there was a dispute. In addition to helping Shi Qinghong to intimidate and force the perpetrators, the other parts did not intervene at all.
