03 Nov 2019, 22:08 by Bloomberg
(Nov 4): McDonald’s Corp. fired Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook because he had a consensual relationship with an employee against company policy.
The burger company’s board voted Friday to terminate Easterbrook, 52, after investigating the relationship, according to a statement Sunday. It promoted Chris Kempczinski to president and CEO.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Easterbrook sent an email to employees Sunday.
”This was a mistake,” Easterbrook said in the email, according to the newspaper. “Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.”
Easterbrook had run the company since 2015. He was the head of the U.S. division before taking over the global operation.
Kempczinski joined McDonald’s in 2015 to oversee global strategy, business development and innovation. He most recently served as president of the U.S. business.
Joe Erlinger, who joined the company in 2002, will become president of the U.S. business.
McDonald’s has more than 38,000 locations in 100 countries, including 14,000 in the U.S. - Bloomberg
