【富家子運動的騙局 2】運動是複製菁英階級的密碼
03 Nov 2019, 22:46 by 謝樹寬
哈佛提供運動員更多教育機會並無問題。問題是哈佛並不提供運動獎學金。它招生入學的運動員往往不是有潛力的低收入學生，或是未來有機會從事職業運動的運動明星。運動員的招生制度似乎無關學術或機會的公平，純粹是為了錢。這些費用高昂的運動項目，也成了優惠有錢白人的入學管道。
阿爾西迪亞克諾（Peter Arcidiacono）論文裡的數據提到，常春藤名校的校隊比其他同學更白、也更有錢。
常春藤聯盟學校的棒球、越野、擊劍，草地曲棍球、高爾夫、冰球、袋棍球、划船、帆船、滑雪、壘球、壁球、網球、排球、水球和摔角的校隊，非裔和西裔學生比例不到10%。
在哈佛，運動校隊許多來自高收入家庭學生。根據哈佛校內的資料，運動員招募學生家庭收入超過50萬美元的比例是非運動員學生家庭的兩倍。
《大西洋期刊》的報導也提到，富家子運動不只是在大學入學時發揮威力，它對美國菁英的專業服務業－－律師事務所、投資銀行、顧問公司－－決定要雇用什麼人也扮演了驚人的巨大作用。
美國西北大學社會學家瑞維拉（Lauren A. Rivera）在2015年出版的《家譜：菁英學生如何獲得菁英工作》（Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs）書中，曾問菁英公司的雇主們如何挑選新進員工，她發現答案是簡單三個字：Ivy League Sports（長春藤聯盟運動）。
瑞維拉說，菁英公司招聘新進員工是根據的是兩件事。首先他們篩選「最好」的學校，如哈佛、史丹佛、普林斯頓的學生。其次他們會察看應徵者的課外活動，尤其是他們在高中和大學參加什麼運動。
當然，你不是有運動就行。招募人員對應徵者的運動項目最偏好的是「曲棍球、網球、壁球、或划船」。因為這些運動具備了稀有性（rarity）和排他性（exclusion）。這些運動成了階級的符碼，讓上流社會的菁英們辨識彼此。
一名銀行家告訴瑞維拉說：「你不會在底特律的公立學校找到一個壁球（squash）選手。對他們來說，南瓜（squash，和壁球同樣拼法）只是一種蔬菜。」在菁英的企業裡，透過高檔時髦的運動，高階主管可以篩選出和他們社經地位相當的新人，而不需面試時當面問他：「孩子，你家裡是不是像我家一樣有錢？」
於是，運動不再是一種休閒活動，而是攸關教育和就業的競賽。有錢的父母、菁英大學、還有菁英的企業都參與了這部複製特權的機器。

[The scam of the rich family movement 2] The movement is to copy the password of the elite class
03 Nov 2019, 22:46 by Xie Shukuan
There is no problem with Harvard providing athletes with more educational opportunities. The problem is that Harvard does not offer sports scholarships. Athletes enrolled in school are often not potential low-income students, or sports stars who have the opportunity to engage in professional sports in the future. The athletes’ enrollment system seems to have nothing to do with academic or opportunity fairness, purely for money. These costly sports have also become an admissions channel for wealthy whites.
The data in the paper by Peter Arcidiacono mentions that the Ivy League school team is whiter and richer than other students.
Ivy League School's baseball, cross country, fencing, grass hockey, golf, ice hockey, bag hockey, boating, sailing, skiing, softball, squash, tennis, volleyball, water polo and wrestling school teams, the proportion of African-American and Hispanic students Less than 10%.
At Harvard, many sports school teams come from high-income families. According to information from Harvard School, the proportion of athletes recruiting students with family incomes exceeding $500,000 is twice that of non-athlete students.
The ""Atlantic Journal"" report also mentioned that the rich family movement is not only the power of college admissions, it also decides which people to hire for the professional services industry of the United States - law firms, investment banks, consultants Played an amazingly great role.
Lauren A. Rivera, a sociologist at Northwestern University, asked Elite in the book ""Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs"" published in 2015. How employers choose new employees, she found the answer is three simple words: Ivy League Sports.
Rivera said that the recruitment of new employees by Elite is based on two things. First they screened the ""best"" schools, such as Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton students. Secondly, they will look at the candidates' extracurricular activities, especially what sports they participate in in high school and college.
Of course, you don't have to exercise. The recruiter's sports program for the recruiter is most likely to be ""hockey, tennis, squash, or rowing."" Because these movements have rarity and exclusion. These movements became the code of the class, allowing the elites of the upper class to recognize each other.
A banker told Rivera: ""You won't find a squash player at a public school in Detroit. For them, pumpkin (squash, spelling the same as squash) is just a vegetable."" In the enterprise, through high-end fashion sports, senior executives can screen out newcomers who are equivalent to their social status, and ask him when interviewing: ""Children, is your family as rich as my family?""
As a result, sports are no longer a leisure activity, but a competition for education and employment. Rich parents, elite universities, and elite companies are all involved in this privileged machine.
