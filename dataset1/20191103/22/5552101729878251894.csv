【地表最強里長番外篇】南機場金婆婆銀婆婆的故事
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 簡竹書, 楊子磊, 吳偉韶
北市「南機場公寓」落成於半個世紀前，當年是全台灣第一個有抽水馬桶的大型社區，然而因每戶坪數多半僅十幾坪，隨著社會變遷，後來南機場成了高齡人口比例甚高的社區，獨居老人尤其不少。



里長方荷生說，起初他提供長輩共餐服務，是想以此掌握社區長輩的起居，避免有長輩在家中獨自過世多日才被發現，後來社區長輩們逐漸因此相熟，透過一起吃飯、早上一起來上活化筋骨等運動課程，彼此互相看顧。
忠勤里的共餐地點在「樂活園地」的一樓，可提供數十人共餐，方荷生特地選購圓桌，「很多社區共餐是用長桌，但那是開會的桌子，感覺像來開會、吃飯。圓桌卻是像回厝裡面吃飯，這是阮叨。感覺就是不一樣。」
透過共餐或送餐，里長也得以掌握社區長輩健康狀況，「長輩信賴我們，身體不舒服，我們懂得送醫院。」方荷生笑說，因為社區長者比例高，乾脆與附近的和平醫院合作，希望醫院提供更多健康課程等等服務，忠勤里如今可是和平醫院的大客戶。
南機場公寓早年住戶多半是1949年來台的軍人或軍眷，有些老兵終身未婚，因此，方荷生提供的服務甚至包括：「如果長輩真的不行了，交代我辦後事，我們也幫他辦。如果長輩交代我要把骨灰帶回大陸，我就帶回去。」他說，至今已辦過數百件後事，也帶過不少老兵骨灰回大陸安葬。
方荷生還說了一個「金婆婆銀婆婆」的故事，「日本不是有金婆婆銀婆婆的故事嗎，我們也有，兩個婆婆住在同一棟，每天在樓梯碰面，一碰面就常常吵架。」他笑說，老人家脾性就是如此。金婆婆與銀婆婆皆是丈夫過世後獨居。
直到有一天，金婆婆忽然對方荷生說，怎麼兩天沒看到銀婆婆了？方荷生覺得不對勁，找了人一起去銀婆婆家中查看，才發現銀婆婆在浴室跌倒，過世了。
方荷生協助銀婆婆辦喪事，「金婆婆堅持要來，那天，化完妝（銀婆婆大體妝）推出來之後，金婆婆說好醜，這不是銀婆婆。」於是幾個人包了小紅包，請化妝師重新畫得漂亮些。
「再推出來，金婆婆看了說，嗯，這個才是她。我們才開始辦喪事。」他說，金婆婆銀婆婆以前經常拌嘴罵來罵去，卻也一直是互相看顧的老朋友。

[The strongest in the surface, the long story] The story of the golden mother-in-law of the South Airport
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Jian Zhushu, Yang Zilei, Wu Weiwei
The ""South Airport Apartment"" in Beibei was completed half a century ago. It was the first large community in Taiwan with a flush toilet. However, since the number of flats per household was only a dozen or so pings, with the social changes, the South Airport became a senior population. In a very high proportion of communities, there are especially many elderly people living alone.



Li Changfang said that at the beginning, he provided elders' meal service. He wanted to master the life of the community elders and avoid the elders who were alone in the family for many days before being discovered. Later, the community elders gradually became familiar with each other. Together, you will be able to look after each other on a sports course such as activating bones.
The dining place in Zhongqin is on the first floor of ""Luohuo Garden"". It can provide dozens of people to eat together. Fang Hesheng specially chooses a round table. ""Many community meals are long tables, but it is a table for meetings, it feels like Come to a meeting and eat. The round table is like eating inside, it’s awkward. It feels different.""
Through sharing meals or delivering meals, Li Chang also has the health status of the community elders. ""Elders trust us and are uncomfortable. We know how to send them to hospitals."" Fang Hesheng said with a smile, because of the high proportion of elderly people in the community, simply cooperate with the nearby Peace Hospital. I hope that the hospital will provide more health courses and other services. Zhongqinli is now a big customer of Peace Hospital.
Most of the early residences of South Airport Apartments were military or military cadres who came to Taiwan in 1949. Some veterans were unmarried for life. Therefore, the services provided by Fang Hesheng even include: ""If the elders really can't do it, let me know what to do, and we will help him."" If the elders confess that I want to bring the ashes back to the mainland, I will bring them back."" He said that hundreds of incidents have been done so far, and many veterans have been brought back to the mainland for burial.
Fang Hesheng also said the story of a ""Golden Mother-in-law"". ""Is there a story of a mother-in-law of the mother-in-law of Japan? We also have two mother-in-laws living in the same building, meeting each other on the stairs every day, and often quarreling when they meet."" He laughed and said that the old man's temperament is like this. Both Jin Po and Yin Po are living alone after her husband passed away.
Until one day, Jin Popo suddenly said to the other child, how did she not see her silver mother in two days? Fang Hesheng felt that something was wrong. When he went to the silver mother-in-law’s house to see it, he found that Yin’s mother fell down in the bathroom and passed away.
Fang Hesheng assisted the silver mother-in-law to do the funeral. ""Golden mother-in-law insisted on coming. On that day, after the makeup was finished (the silver mother-in-law's general makeup), the golden mother-in-law said that it was ugly, this is not the silver mother-in-law."" So several people wrapped up a small red envelope, please The makeup artist repainted beautifully.
""Re-launch, Jinmao looked and said, um, this is her. We only started the funeral."" He said that the mother-in-law of the mother-in-law has often sneaked around and squatted, but she has always been an old friend who cares for each other.
