撤換傳言不止 韓正週三公開見林鄭料談香港

03 Nov 2019, 22:27

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】香港行政長官林鄭月娥本月5日結束在上海的活動後，將赴北京出席粵港澳大灣區會議，並將於6日上午與分管港澳事務的中共國務院副總理韓正會面。據信屆時韓正將向林鄭下達中共四中全會作出的有關香港的具體指令，但不會涉及林鄭下台的問題。有港媒引述評論人士表示，料北京尚需林鄭在下台前替中共做盡「髒活」（DIRTY JOB）。
香港政府週日(3日)發布的消息，目前正在訪問南京和上海的林鄭月娥，5日結束在上海參加的第二屆中國國際進口博覽會活動後，當晚將乘飛機赴北京。6日上午，林鄭將獲韓正接見，其後於下午出席粵港澳大灣區建設領導小組第三次全體會議，7日返港。而林鄭的這次北京之行，港府政制及內地事務局局長聶德權和行政長官辦公室主任陳國基將會隨行。
這是香港爆發反送中運動以來，負責分管港澳事務的韓正首度公開接見林鄭月娥。今年6月海外曾盛傳韓正曾親赴深圳，與林鄭月娥密會並討論「反送中」情勢，但此消息並未獲得中共官方的證實。
港府的新聞公告沒有提及韓正接見林鄭月娥將談到什麼具體內容，但鑒於剛剛結束的中共十九大四中全會曾重點討論香港問題，並聲稱要「健全」中共中央對香港的管治，建制派學者預料，韓正這次會見林鄭，會就香港問題正式表態，並下達中央的有關指令。
此前，兼任香港基本法委員會主任的中共人大常委會法工委主任沈春耀曾對外放風稱，北京當局料將加強中央政府對香港的管治，包括進一步強化中共中央對香港特區政府的管治，包括對特首和官員的任命權，以致加強警隊執法以及如何讓香港「融入」大灣區等內容。
對此，法廣援引中國港澳研究會副會長劉兆佳表示，相信今次韓正除了針對香港反修例風波正式闡明中央政府的立場外，還會交付任務，包括要求港府利用法律手段加大打擊示威者，亦會支持警隊繼續「止暴制亂」，但估計不會談及特首去留問題。
香港蘋果新聞則援引時事評論員劉銳紹分析指出，中共四中全會提出了不少香港問題，都有具體後續工作需要特首落實。相信這次韓正與林鄭的會面所談的內容，將包括加強中共中央對香港特區問責班子的人事任免權力，以及解決公務員體系與問責班子間出現的斷層等問題。劉說：「北京可能覺得公務員隊伍抗衡，令政策不能落實。」
其次，中共為了提高香港特區政府所謂「止暴制亂」的能力，或將擴充機制，包括更多利用諸如傳聞中警方有專線接駁到中國大陸法院的等等。但劉相信，這次的會面不會觸及林鄭下台的問題，因中共的慣例是不會與特首先做雙向討論，而是「落決定後就直接同你講」。
獨立評論人協會召集人、浸大新聞系高級講師呂秉權亦認為，這次韓正與林鄭會面，不會談及林鄭下台的問題，反而會繼續下達指令，利用林鄭去做盡「髒活」 （DIRTY JOB），這樣等將來新的特首上台時，「不需要揹太多的黑包袱」。
呂秉權並分析指出，四中全會對香港方針政策明顯是收緊對港管治，相信後續連串措施將會落實，特別是國家安全上要有執行機制，中共會試圖利用香港法律達到臨時23條之效果，官員任免上亦會有更大幹預，甚至鑽盡《基本法》條文的空子，不排除中共中央在林鄭下台後，以緊急情況為由，不舉行選舉就通過協商而產生下一任特首的可能性。
此外，林鄭月娥已於10月31日前往上海，並將於5日出席第2屆中國國際進口博覽會開幕式，而身為中國國家主席的習近平也會出席這場活動，因此外界也十分關注，習會否藉此機會接見林鄭月娥，並討論香港的情勢。
今年10月1日林鄭月娥赴北京參加中共政府舉行的慶典活動時，雖然並沒有正式安排她與中央領導公開會晤，但林鄭月娥在出席國慶典禮後轉道深圳回港，當時就有輿論認為，林鄭月娥當日應是在深圳與中共的重要官員暗中有會晤。而林鄭回到香港後，隨即宣布正式「撤回」修例，亦加深了有關猜測。

Reversing rumors, Han Zheng, seeing Lin Zheng on Wednesday, Hong Kong

03 Nov 2019, 22:27

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue will go to Beijing to attend the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Great Bay Area meeting after the event ends in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, and will be in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs on the morning of the 6th. Han Zheng, vice premier of the State Council, met. It is believed that Han Zheng will issue specific instructions to Hong Kong to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, but will not address the issue of Lin Zheng’s stepping down. Some Hong Kong media quoted commentators as saying that Beijing still needs Lin Zheng to do DIRTY JOB for the Chinese Communist Party before he stepped down.
The Hong Kong government announced on Sunday (3rd) that Lin Zhengyue, who is currently visiting Nanjing and Shanghai, will fly to Beijing on the evening after finishing the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai on the 5th. On the morning of the 6th, Lin Zheng will be interviewed by Han Zheng, and then attend the third plenary meeting of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Dawan District Construction Leading Group in the afternoon and return to Hong Kong on the 7th. Lin Zheng’s trip to Beijing, the head of the Hong Kong Government’s Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Nie Dequan, and the Director of the Chief Executive’s Office, Chen Guoji, will accompany him.
This is the first time that Han Zheng, who is in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, has publicly interviewed Lin Zhengyue since the outbreak of the anti-delivery campaign in Hong Kong. In June this year, overseas officials had rumored that Han Zheng had personally went to Shenzhen to discuss with Lin Zhengyue and discuss the ""reverse delivery"" situation, but the news was not confirmed by the official CCP.
The Hong Kong Government’s press release did not mention what Han Zheng was going to meet with Lin Zhengyue’s specific content. However, in view of the just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, he focused on the Hong Kong issue and claimed to “sound” the CPC’s governance of Hong Kong. The founding scholars expected that Han Zheng would meet with Lin Zheng this time and formally state his position on the Hong Kong issue and issue relevant instructions from the central government.
Prior to this, Shen Chunyao, director of the Standing Committee of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress, who was also the director of the Hong Kong Basic Law Committee, said that the Beijing authorities are expected to strengthen the central government's governance of Hong Kong, including further strengthening the CPC Central Committee's governance of the Hong Kong SAR government, including The appointment of chief executives and officials has resulted in enhanced police enforcement and how to integrate Hong Kong into the Great Bay Area.
In response, Liu Guangjia, vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Macao Research Association of China, said that he believes that this time Han will officially clarify the position of the central government in response to the Hong Kong anti-reforms storm, and will also deliver tasks, including asking the Hong Kong government to use legal means to increase the crackdown on demonstrations. It will also support the Police Force to continue to ""stop the storm"", but it is estimated that the Chief Executive will not talk about leaving the issue.
Hong Kong Apple News quoted Liu Rushao, a commentator on current affairs, as saying that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has raised many Hong Kong issues and that specific follow-up work requires the implementation of the Chief Executive. I believe that the content of this meeting between Han Zheng and Lin Zheng will include strengthening the power of the CPC Central Committee for the appointment and dismissal of the Hong Kong SAR's accountability team, as well as solving the problems between the civil service system and the accountability team. Liu said: ""Beijing may feel that the civil service team is competing and the policy cannot be implemented.""
Secondly, in order to enhance the ability of the Hong Kong SAR Government to ""stop the storm"", the CCP may expand its mechanism, including making more use of the police, such as the rumor, that the police have a special line to connect to the Chinese mainland courts. However, Liu believes that this meeting will not touch on the issue of Lin Zheng’s stepping down. Because the CCP’s practice is not to have a two-way discussion with the special first, it is to talk directly to you after the decision is made.
Lv Bingquan, a convener of the Independent Critics Association and a senior lecturer at the Department of Information of the Baptist University, also believes that this time Han Zheng met with Lin Zheng and did not talk about the issue of Lin Zheng’s stepping down. Instead, he will continue to issue instructions and use Lin Zheng to do “dirty work” ( DIRTY JOB), so that when the new chief executive comes to power, ""no need to carry too much black bag"".
Lv Bingquan also pointed out that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Hong Kong Plenary Session is obviously tightening the governance of Hong Kong. I believe that the follow-up measures will be implemented. In particular, there must be an enforcement mechanism for national security. The CCP will try to use the laws of Hong Kong to reach provisional 23 The effect will be greater interference in the appointment and dismissal of officials, and even the exhaustion of the provisions of the Basic Law. It is not ruled out that after the demise of Lin Zheng, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will use the emergency situation as the reason for the emergency. The possibility.
In addition, Lin Zhengyue has traveled to Shanghai on October 31 and will attend the opening ceremony of the 2nd China International Import Expo on the 5th. Xi Jinping, who is the Chinese president, will also attend the event, so the outside world is also very concerned. Will the seminar take the opportunity to meet with Lin Zhengyue and discuss the situation in Hong Kong.
When Lin Zhengyue went to Beijing to attend the celebrations held by the Chinese government on October 1 this year, although she did not formally arrange her public meeting with the central leadership, Lin Zhengyue returned to Shenzhen after attending the National Day ceremony. At that time, there was public opinion that On the same day, Lin Zhengyue should have a secret meeting with important officials of the Chinese Communist Party in Shenzhen. After Lin Zheng returned to Hong Kong, he immediately announced the formal ""withdrawal"" of the amendments, which also deepened the speculation.
