港警催淚彈誤炸自己人 港民鼓掌歡呼：自食其果（視頻）

03 Nov 2019, 22:28

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】香港民主抗爭運動本週末繼續延燒。週六抗議者在香港多個地區發起了多場集會活動，有數十名抗議人士被警方逮捕。當警方在香港灣仔修頓球場試圖驅散抗議人群時，意外發生了催淚彈在警方防線上空爆炸事件。有網民隨後在網絡上曝光了一名警員疑因吸入催淚煙後身體不適而躲入小巷中跪地休息的照片和相關視頻，眾多網民紛紛留言嘲笑港警「自食其果」。
香港「反送中」抗爭活動仍在持續。香港民眾11月2日又舉行了多場集會活動，其中僅在愛丁堡廣場和遮打花園舉行的兩場集會獲得了警方的不反對通知書。當晚，在警方強行驅逐抗議者的過程中，有身份不明人士在滙豐銀行總部和中國銀行香港分行附近投擲燃燒彈，新華社香港分社也被人投擲了汽油瓶。
警方在香港灣仔修頓球場採取清場行動時，向抗議者投擲了不少催淚彈。期間，有催淚彈意外在警方防線上爆開，而當時的風向也恰恰把釋出的催淚煙霧吹回警隊之中，導致部分未佩戴防毒面具的警員吸入了催淚彈的煙霧。許多參與集會的市民當場鼓掌慶賀。
該消息迅速在網絡社群中被熱傳，並有網友很快曝光了在事發現場拍攝的視頻和圖片，顯示有幾名警員疑因吸入催淚煙而引發不適，躲入一條小巷之中，其中一名警員更痛苦地跪倒在地上。
《立場新聞》在臉書上的相關貼文和曝光的圖片視頻被廣大網友熱傳，不少網友為此拍手叫好，紛紛留言稱港警這次是「自作自受」、「報應」、「自食其果」。
有網友留言評論稱，「每個警察多吃100顆催淚彈都不夠償還自己的所作所為。」
有網友評論道：「平時肆無忌憚用化學武器攻擊市民，這次讓它們也嚐嚐山埃氰化物的味道！」
還有網友發帖嘲笑道，「第一次吃（催淚煙霧）嗎？多吃幾次就習慣了」。
也有網民分析稱，有可能是中國大陸生產的催淚彈質量不行，導致警員拋出時意外提前引爆。

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The Hong Kong Democratic Resistance Campaign continued to burn this weekend. On Saturday, protesters launched a number of gatherings in various parts of Hong Kong, and dozens of protesters were arrested by the police. When the police tried to disperse the protesters at the Southorn Stadium in Wanchai, Hong Kong, a tear gas bomb exploded in the police to prevent an online bombing. Some netizens then exposed photos and related videos of a police officer who was suspected of hiding in the alleys due to physical discomfort after inhaling tears. Many netizens replied that the Hong Kong police ""satisfed their own food.""
The ""reverse delivery"" protests in Hong Kong are still continuing. The Hong Kong people held a number of gatherings on November 2nd, in which only two meetings held at Edinburgh Place and Chater Garden received police notices of no objection. In the evening, during the forced eviction of the protesters by the police, unidentified persons threw firebombs near HSBC headquarters and Bank of China Hong Kong Branch, and Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch was also throwing gasoline bottles.
When the police took a clearance operation at the Southorn Stadium in Wan Chai, Hong Kong, they threw a lot of tear gas to the protesters. During the period, a tear gas accident exploded on the police defense line, and the wind direction also immediately released the released tear gas back to the police, causing some police officers who did not wear gas masks to inhale the tear gas. Many citizens who participated in the rally applauded on the spot.
The news was quickly spread in the online community, and some netizens quickly exposed the videos and pictures taken at the scene of the incident, showing that several police officers suspected of inducing discomfort due to inhalation of tears and hid in an alley. Among them, one of the police officers fell to the ground more painfully.
The related posts on Facebook and the exposed photos and videos on Facebook were popular among the netizens. Many netizens applauded this. They all said that the Hong Kong police were ""self-sufficient"", ""retribution"" and ""self-sufficiency"".
Some netizens commented that ""every policeman who eats 100 tear gas bombs is not enough to pay for what he has done.""
Some netizens commented: ""I usually use chemical weapons to attack the public. This time, let them taste the taste of cyanide!""
Some netizens posted a message and sneered, ""Is it the first time I eat (tears and smog)? I have gotten used to eating more.""
Some netizens also said that it is possible that the quality of tear gas produced in mainland China is not good, leading to accidental detonation when police officers throw out.
