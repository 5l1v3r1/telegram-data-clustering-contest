      <h1>Hope for ban on sick trophy hunt imports as talks begin on ending cruel 'sport'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: A new consultation will examine four options, including a ban on import and export of hunting trophies and stricter requirements to demonstrate 'clear benefits' to conservation and local communities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:45:17+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>A ban on sick trophy hunting imports is edging closer as a public consultation on stopping the sick souvenirs being brought to Britain gets underway.</p>
      <p>Environment Minister Zac Goldsmith hit out at the vile practice as he announced a 12-week call for evidence which could lead to a crackdown.</p>
      <p>Writing exclusively in the Mirror, he said he was “repulsed and baffled” at the senseless killing of big game as trophies.</p>
      <p>Mr Goldsmith added: “I’m pleased we are able to launch this consultation to address the import and export of hunting trophies.”</p>

      <p>The consultation will examine four options, including a ban on the import and export of hunting trophies from certain species and stricter requirements to demonstrate clear benefits to conservation and local communities.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 lions are killed every year, along with hippos, elephants, bears and rhinos by trophy hunters.</p>
      <p>Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting founder Eduardo Goncalves said: “British trophy hunters are among the worst in the world when it comes to shooting lions in captivity and elephants. Killing animals purely for pleasure and to show off a trophy has no place in a civilised society.”</p>
      <p>The Mirror’s End Trophy Hunting campaign is supported by celebrities, MPs, peers and conservation charities.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a trophy hunting firm is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/trophy-hunting-firm-offering-sickening-20526636">offering a sickening buy one, get one free package</a> – throwing in a lioness if a customer pays to shoot a lion.</p>
      <p>The offer at Mkulu African Hunting Safaris comes as wildlife experts warn cheap air fares and falling tour prices are making the vile pursuit affordable to far more people.</p>
      <p>The advert boasts: “Book a lion hunt with us and add a lioness at no extra cost.”</p>
      <p>Eduardo Goncalves, of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “Business is booming for the trophy industry.</p>
      <p>“Before, it was just the landed gentry and army colonels who went on hunting safaris.</p>
      <p>“Today, it’s gas engineers, utility company customer service managers, NHS suppliers, internet provider supervisors and even pensioners jetting off to kill wild animals for fun.</p>
