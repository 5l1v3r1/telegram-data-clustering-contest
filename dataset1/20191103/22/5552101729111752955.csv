【通靈檢察官1】仙姑女檢現場感應死者　墜樓命案玄奇偵破
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 林俊宏, 楊兆元
挾著第一季熱度、日前開播的電視劇《通靈少女2》，再度引發戲迷熱議，但在現實世界裡，桃園地檢署也有位被稱為「仙姑」的女檢察官，自稱具通靈能力、看得見靈魂的她多次告訴同仁「背後有人跟著」，讓其他檢察官懷疑地檢署有鬼。最勁爆的是，她連辦案或相驗遺體也能感應磁場，感受到死者傳遞訊息，還因此偵破一起吸毒墜樓命案，宛如「通靈女檢」，引起司法圈議論。

10月6日，《通靈少女2》開播，敘述具有靈異體質的高中生謝雅真（郭書瑤飾演）白天上課，晚上在宮廟當仙姑，靠著通靈起乩的超能力，為信眾解惑，年紀輕輕的她，扮演陰陽兩界的溝通橋梁，因此看盡人生百態。
巧合的是，桃園地檢署也有一位被稱為「仙姑」的女檢察官林欣怡，自稱擁有通靈體質的她，不但能感應到死者傳遞的訊息，還能居中穿針引線，協助死者家屬問事，不僅震驚案件當事人，司法圈對此也議論紛紛。

最讓同事感到神奇的是，現為緝毒組檢察官的林欣怡，竟靠感應偵破一起墜樓命案。案件偵辦時，她覺得死因有外力介入，而非外界以為的單純自殺，為了追出真相，她到現場模擬時，還刻意站到頂樓最高處、即死者生前墜樓的位置，最後感應到是毒品釀禍，進而將幕後供毒者全數繩之以法。


桃園地檢署日前落成啟用，通靈女檢林欣怡常向同仁稱五樓南側廁所有不少「髒東西」。

桃園地檢署表示，不論檢察官林欣怡是否真的具備特殊體質得以通靈感應，檢察官偵辦刑事案件，最終仍必須依據卷證資料來認定事實，力求無枉勿縱，實現公平正義。

[Psychic Prosecutor 1] The immortal female inspected the scene to sense the deceased
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Lin Junhong, Yang Zhaoyuan
Taking advantage of the first season's heat and the recently released TV series ""Psychic Girl 2"", it has once again triggered a heated debate among fans, but in the real world, the Taoyuan District Procuratorate also has a female prosecutor known as ""Xiangu"", who claims to have a pass. She has the ability to see the soul, and she has repeatedly told her colleagues that ""there is someone behind me,"" and let other prosecutors suspect that the prosecutor has a ghost. The most exciting thing is that she can detect the magnetic field even when she handles the case or the body of the test. She feels that the deceased has transmitted the message, and therefore she has detected a drug homicide case, like a ""psychic woman test"", causing the judicial circle to discuss.


The fairy tale of the TV series ""Psychic Girl"" communicates with both the Yin and Yang circles. (Flip the public Facebook fan group)

On October 6th, ""Psychic Girl 2"" was broadcasted, and the high school student Xie Yazhen (played by Guo Shuyao), who had a spiritual physique, was given a class during the day. At night, he was a fairy at the temple, relying on the super power of the spirit to confuse the believers. At a young age, she plays the bridge of communication between the two sides of Yin and Yang, so she looks at life.
Coincidentally, the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office also has a female prosecutor named Lin Xinyi, who is known as ""Xiangu"". She claims to have a psychic physique. She can not only sense the message transmitted by the deceased, but also help the deceased's family members to ask questions. Not only did the parties in the case be shocked, but the judicial circle also talked about it.


""Tong Ling Women's Inspection"" Lin Xinyi not only has yin and yang eyes, but also can sense the message of the deceased. She is called ""Xian Gu"" by her colleagues. (provided by the reader)

What makes colleagues most surprised is that Lin Xinyi, who is now a prosecutor of the anti-drug group, actually relied on induction to detect a murder. When the case was investigated, she felt that the cause of death was externally intervened, rather than the simple suicide thought by the outside world. In order to chase the truth, when she went to the scene to simulate, she also deliberately stood at the highest point of the top floor, that is, the position of the deceased who fell to the building before the death. Drugs are blamed, and all those behind the scenes are brought to justice.


The Taoyuan District Inspection Office was recently commissioned. Lin Lingyi, a psychic woman, often told her colleagues that there were many ""dirty things"" in the toilet on the south side of the fifth floor.

The Taoyuan District Procuratorate said that no matter whether the prosecutor Lin Xinyi really has a special constitution to be inspired, the prosecutor will investigate the criminal case, and ultimately must still rely on the information of the certificate to determine the facts, and strive to achieve injustice and justice.
