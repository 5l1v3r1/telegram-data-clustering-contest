（中央社記者龍柏安台北3日電）林書豪在中國男子職業籃球聯賽（CBA）處女秀，沒讓球迷失望，首役他繳出25分、9助攻與6籃板的全能數據，率領北京首鋼以103比81擊敗天津先行者，開出紅盤。
上季隨美國職籃（NBA）多倫多暴龍奪得隊史首冠的林書豪，本季轉戰CBA再出發。賽前他在微博「發願」表示，本季只要每投進一顆3分球，就要捐出3000人民幣（約新台幣1萬3164元），累計到季末捐給基金會做公益，用以幫助北京的小朋友。
林書豪今天出賽35分鐘，累計18投中7，另有12罰11中，攻下全場最高的25分，可惜3分球5投盡墨，還未開張。
生涯在CBA的第一場比賽，林書豪也吸引大批球迷進場觀賽，他上半場僅得9分，5次助攻；半場打完北京以45比46落後天津。
上半場手感冷冰冰的林書豪，下半場改以快攻和切入搶分，他第3節狂轟14分，且率領北京拉出一波33比18攻勢奠定勝基，第3節最後43.2秒，他單兵快攻上籃，球進算還造成犯規，一口氣連拿3分，也幫助球隊取得14分領先。
北京雖是客場作戰，不過第3節尾聲當林書豪站上罰球線，現場天津球迷也高喊著「林書豪加油」，讓人見識到林書豪在中國的高人氣。
林書豪攻勢打開後，也帶動北京全隊攻勢，第4節北京一度握有24分領先，幾已提前底定勝局。林書豪在比賽剩下5分51秒時下場，功成身退，交由隊友負責收尾，最後北京輕鬆摘下首勝。（編輯：屈享平）1081103
