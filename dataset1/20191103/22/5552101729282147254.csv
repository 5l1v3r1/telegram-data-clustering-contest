【地表最強里長番外篇】胖里長的課輔班　為何堅持聘專職老師
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 簡竹書, 楊子磊, 吳偉韶
都說不要給孩子太多課業壓力，台北市忠勤里里長方荷生卻堅持他辦的課輔班就是補習，還堅持聘專職教師。



「一般社福團體做課後輔導是做遊戲式的，但我知道台北市真的很現實，功課進步了，學校老師看得起、同學看得起，孩子才會看得起自己，不然他5科加起來沒有100分，坐在教室裡老師痛苦他也痛苦。」他說，也會請大學生辦活動，但課輔班就是教課業，且一定找專職教師。
「專職老師可以陪著孩子一整年，看到孩子一整年的進步，跟孩子產生互信，而且孩子知道老師對他好，當這個孩子在學校發生什麼事，我的老師都會知道，學校老師也會知道這孩子在這裡發生什麼事，兩個老師互相連結。」
忠勤里的課輔班上課時間頗長，週一至週五，每天下午4點至9點，中間提供晚餐。寒暑假也沒停，方荷生說，社區裡的孩子常因家庭經濟因素，寒暑假沒能力去補習，「就放牛吃草，但放出去以後2個月就拉不回來了。」他說，忠勤里靠近萬華，宮廟多，誘惑也多，青少年極容易在暑假期間受誘惑接觸毒品、或去西門町援交。

[The strongest in the surface, the long story] The long class of the fat class, why insist on hiring a full-time teacher

They said that they should not give too much pressure on their children. In the city of Taipei, Zhongli Lili, the long-term student of the school, insisted that his class is a tutoring, and he insisted on hiring full-time teachers.



""General social welfare groups do after-school tutoring is a game-style, but I know that Taipei City is really realistic, the homework has improved, the school teachers can afford it, the students can afford it, the children will be able to see themselves, otherwise he will not have 100 in the 5 subjects. Points, sitting in the classroom, the teacher is suffering, he is also suffering."" He said, college students will also be invited to do activities, but the class is the teaching industry, and must find full-time teachers.
""The full-time teacher can accompany the child for a whole year, see the child's progress throughout the year, and have mutual trust with the child, and the child knows that the teacher is good to him. When the child happens at school, my teacher will know that the school teacher I will also know what happened to the child here, and the two teachers are connected to each other.""
The class in Zhongqin’s class is quite long. From Monday to Friday, every day from 4pm to 9pm, dinner is served in the middle. The summer and winter vacations have not stopped. Fang Hesheng said that children in the community often have no ability to go to tutoring because of family economic factors. ""I will graze cattle, but I will not be able to pull back after two months of release."" He said, Zhongqin is close to Wanhua, there are many palaces and temples, and there are many temptations. It is very easy for young people to be tempted to contact drugs during the summer vacation or to help Ximending.
