【通靈檢察官2】「阿公在旁邊看著你們」　爭遺產家屬一聽全楞住
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 林俊宏, 攝影組
仙姑女檢林欣怡據說擁有陰陽眼，能見到死者的魂魄，偶爾還會提醒剛相驗完遺體的檢察官同仁，「死者的靈魂已跟回地檢署」，一句話聽得讓人背脊發涼，有時同仁背後明明沒人，女檢卻稱「有人跟著」，讓檢察官懷疑地檢署是否真的有鬼。


桃園地檢署日前落成啟用，通靈女檢林欣怡常向同仁稱五樓南側廁所有不少「髒東西」。

不僅如此，有次她到殯儀館相驗一名老翁大體，家屬們為了死者的後事大吵，就在二邊意見不合、鬧得不可開交之際，她突然拍桌怒斥：「不要再吵了，阿公在旁邊看著你們。」家屬一聽全楞住，不但乖乖閉嘴，還頻頻追問「阿公還有沒有說什麼？」


「通靈女檢」林欣怡不但有陰陽眼，還能感應死者傳遞訊息，被同事稱為「仙姑」。（讀者提供）

此外，一位檢察官同事有次偵辦一起溺斃案件，解剖後發現死者胃部有大量安眠藥，懷疑死者因毒品糾紛，生前遭強灌藥物再被丟進池塘溺死，全案朝他殺方向偵辦。由於現場位處荒郊野外，沒有目擊者及監視器，案情陷入膠著。
檢方只好死馬當活馬醫，在沒有告知任何案情的情況下，請女檢發功感應提示偵辦方向，只見她隨手摸了摸卷宗，沉默片刻後回說：「死者說他很感謝你們這麼努力調查死因，但他不願追究了。」讓辦案人員不寒而慄。

[Psychic Prosecutor 2] ""Agong looks at you next to you""
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Lin Junhong, Photography Group
Xiangu female Lin Xinyi is said to have yin and yang eyes, can see the soul of the deceased, and occasionally reminds the prosecutor who just finished the examination of the body, ""the soul of the deceased has been returned to the local inspection department"", a sentence to make people back cold Sometimes, there is no one behind the colleagues. The female prosecutor says that ""someone is following,"" and the prosecutor suspects that the prosecutor’s office is really a ghost.


The Taoyuan District Inspection Office was recently commissioned. Lin Lingyi, a psychic woman, often told her colleagues that there were many ""dirty things"" in the toilet on the south side of the fifth floor.

Not only that, but once she went to the funeral parlour to check out an old man, and the family members had a big argument for the aftermath of the deceased. On the other hand, when the two sides disagreed and made trouble, she suddenly slammed the table and said: ""Don’t quarrel again. Ah Gong looked at you next to him."" The family members listened to them all at once, not only shut up, but also frequently asked ""Is there anything that the Agong still said?""


""Tong Ling Women's Inspection"" Lin Xinyi not only has yin and yang eyes, but also can sense the message of the deceased. She is called ""Xian Gu"" by her colleagues. (provided by the reader)

In addition, a prosecutor's colleague once reported a case of defamation. After dissection, he found that there were a large number of sleeping pills in the stomach of the deceased. It was suspected that the deceased was guilty of a drug dispute. He was thrown into the pond and died before his death. The whole case was investigated in the direction of his killing. As the scene was in the wild, there were no witnesses and monitors, and the case fell into a stalemate.
The prosecution had to die as a living horse doctor. In the absence of any case, the woman was asked to check the direction of the investigation. She only touched the file, and after a moment of silence, she said, ""The deceased said that he thanked you very much. So hard to investigate the cause of death, but he is not willing to pursue it."" Let the case handlers shudder.
