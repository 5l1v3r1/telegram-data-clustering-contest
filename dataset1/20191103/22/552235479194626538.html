      <h1>Joe Worrall claims he was 'complete player' at Rangers as he makes bizarre weather statement</h1>
      <h2>The centre-back is now a regular at Nottingham Forest.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:29:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Geoff Knox</a></address>
      <p>Joe Worrall says his season-long stint in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scotland</a> is the reason he is now flying at Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>Defender Worrall spent last term with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>, making 32 appearances in a frantic loan spell.</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-worrall">Worrall</a>, 22, is back with the club he once supported from the City Ground terraces and helping their promotion push.</p>
      <p>Worrall played his part in a masterful Forest performance as the visitors managed to largely silence the home crowd in the driving rain.</p>

      <p>Goals in each half from Lewis Grabban and Sammy Ameobi looked to have put the game out of Luton’s reach, until an 87th-minute Callum McManaman strike caused a late siege on the visitors’ goal.</p>
      <p>Worrall feels his time at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> stood him in good stead, saying: “I was used to the rain last year. And backs-to-the-wall defending is second nature to me.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got intelligent football players and lots of leaders out there, so we know we can pull through games like these.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was the complete player last season. But then you realise that spending a year away from the demands of the Championship, you might need that time away to look at it like an outsider.</p>

      <p>“But I enjoyed my time up there and I’ve come back a much better player. I couldn’t have got a better loan.</p>
      <p>“Now I’m back where I belong, so I’m really happy at the moment.</p>
      <p>“If any other lad gets an opportunity to go up there I’d recommend it – it’s crazy. Especially if you can get a loan to dip your toe into it then come back to your parent club.”</p>
      <p>Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi’s game plan of letting the hosts dominate possession paid off as his side twice punished sloppy defending on the counter-attack.</p>
      <p>Grabban gobbled up one of two presentable first half chances six minutes before the break, then Ameobi curled in from Joe Lolley’s cross just before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>Luton are looking over their shoulders at the drop zone and crestfallen Hatters sub McManaman said: “We can’t be giving those goals away at this level. The lads are disappointed. There weren’t any good individual performances today.</p>
      <p>“But we’re not talking about relegation, we just need to be a bit cleverer.”</p>
