      <h1>Jurgen Klopp explains how he's preparing for Liverpool's Man City showdown</h1>
      <h2>The Reds host the Premier League champions at Anfield next weekend, six points clear at the top of the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:33:53+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp is yet to think about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> crunch clash with champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Reds host Pep Guardiola's champions at Anfield next Sunday, in a mouthwatering encounter between the Premier League's top two.</p>
      <p>But the Anfield chief, whose side sit six points clear at the top, says he isn't even thinking about the visit of City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> came from behind to beat Aston Villa on Saturday, with Sadio Mane's injury-time winner giving them a 2-1 victory - having trailed at half-time.</p>
      <p>But Klopp's side face Genk in the Champions League in midweek and that is his new focus after the win in the West Midlands.</p>

      <p>He insists he hasn't spent any time thinking of next week's fixture and that it didn't cross his mind while speaking to his side at the break.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: “I never thought a second about the Man City game and the Aston Villa game together.</p>
      <p>"I never thought, ‘OK, you should win that, because maybe we lose next week and then we are on a level [points] or whatever.’</p>
      <p>“As yet, I have no clue about any Premier League results from other teams, I didn’t ask, it was not too important."</p>

      <p>And even now that three points at Villa Park have been claimed, the German's focus is firmly on their return meeting with Genk, whom they beat 4-1 in Belgium.</p>
      <p>“We play Genk and then we play City," added Klopp.</p>
      <p>"Yes, it’s important, away at Aston Villa, the way they set up, really important, really difficult, but we did it and that’s good.</p>
      <p>"And now we have to again collect the bounce and prepare for the next challenge - Genk.”</p>
