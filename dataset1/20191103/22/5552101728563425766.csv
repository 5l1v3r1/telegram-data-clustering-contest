【綠能大騙局3】投資太陽能都變董事長　他們下場很悽涼
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 社會組, 攝影組
本刊日前和多位自救會成員約在台北市某短租辦公室見面，在採訪過程中，他們全程戴著口罩，還不時探頭張望，且會不自主地捏手、抖腳，猶如驚弓之鳥。
自救會成員小王、小美、小雯（皆為化名）痛批施慶鴻、楊大業等人，「根本是用時下流行的心靈課程洗腦我們，不斷游說要我們投資太陽能發電廠，現在回想起來，感到非常後悔，因為不僅沒賺到錢，還讓家人的生活更困頓。」
3人異口同聲地告訴本刊，楊大業旗下的業務人員先叫他們以借款、貸款等方式，各自成立公司，強調用公司名義可提高貸款額度，再去和鼎笙簽約，參與時下最流行的太陽能種電計畫。楊還告訴他們，不僅有固定利息可領，還保證獲利，「投得越多，賺得越多！」


自救會成員拿出與鼎笙簽署的太陽能投資合約，指控根本是一場騙局。

本刊查閱楊大業公司網站，標榜「讓淨資產成長超給力」「利率、時間與通膨如何影響你的財務」等口號以及話術充斥其間，教導投資人「活化資產」，就連一些專業的理財週刊，都能看到楊的身影，種種假象讓投資人信以為真，紛紛掏錢或借錢投資。
自救會會長小王進一步指出，楊大業等人以名車代步，教大家如何讓自己的財務自由，加上講課內容十分專業，讓擁有金融背景的小王也因此上當，投資了這個不存在的太陽能電廠。
小雯也說：「後來我們才知道，楊大業開的課程雖然是免費的，但他們在介紹投資案時，有從施慶鴻那邊拿佣金，還說有錢大家賺，當時我就在場。」

本刊調查，2017年曾有媒體大幅報導施慶鴻創立的鼎笙公司，指施為響應蔡 政府的綠能計畫，與在加拿大相當成功的綠能台商合作。
自救會成員說，楊大業等人就是拿相關新聞給他們看，讓他們掉入陷阱，沒想到結果竟是一場騙局，讓他們畢生積蓄毀於一旦。
自救會成員痛批楊大業等人根本就是詐欺，並且強調：「這幾年為了清償債務，大家都很不好過，還有人為此離婚，或者脫離父子關係！」

[Green Energy Big Scam 3] Investing in solar energy has changed the chairman. They are very bleak.
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Social Group, Photography Group
Recently, a number of self-rescue members met in a short-term rental office in Taipei. During the interview, they wore masks all the time. They also looked at them from time to time, and they would involuntarily pinch their hands and shake their feet, just like a bird of surprise.
Self-rescue members Xiao Wang, Xiao Mei, Xiao Wen (both are pseudonyms) criticized Shi Qinghong, Yang Daye and others. ""It is simply brainwashing us with the popular spiritual curriculum. We are constantly lobbying us to invest in solar power plants. Now, in retrospect, I feel very regretful because I have not only made money, but also made my family’s life more difficult.""
The three people told the journal in unison. The business personnel of Yang Daye first asked them to set up their own companies by means of loans and loans. They emphasized that they could increase the loan amount in the name of the company, and then signed a contract with Dingyi to participate in the most popular solar energy. Electric plan. Yang also told them that not only is there a fixed interest rate, but it also guarantees profit. ""The more you vote, the more you earn!""


The self-rescue members took out the solar investment contract signed with Ding, and the allegations were a scam.

This article refers to the website of Yang Daye Company, which advertises the slogan “Let the net assets grow overpowered”, “How interest rates, time and inflation affect your finances”, and the words that are used to teach investors to “activate assets”, even some professional financial management. In the weekly magazine, you can see Yang’s figure. All kinds of illusions make investors believe that they are saving money or borrowing money to invest.
Xiao Wang, the president of the self-help committee, further pointed out that Yang Daye and others traveled by car, teaching everyone how to make their financial freedom, and the content of the lecture was very professional, so that Xiao Wang, who has a financial background, was also fooled and invested in this non-existent solar power plant. .
Xiaowen also said: ""We later learned that although Yang Daye’s courses were free, when they introduced the investment case, they took a commission from Shi Qinghong and said that they had money to make money. I was there.""


Yang Daye’s financial lectures and Ding’s solar projects have all been on the media and become a tool for them to absorb gold. (turning over Facebook)

According to the survey, in 2017, there was a media report from the Dingyi Company founded by Shi Qinghong, referring to the green energy project in response to the Cai government, and the cooperation with the green business in Canada.
The members of the self-rescue society said that Yang Daye and others were taking relevant news to them and let them fall into the trap. They did not expect the result to be a scam, and they would be destroyed in their lives.
Self-rescue members criticized Yang Daye and others for being fraudulent, and stressed: ""In recent years, in order to pay off debts, everyone is very difficult, and some people are divorced or separated from their father-son relationship!""
