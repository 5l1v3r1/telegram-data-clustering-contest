【地表最強里長2】替老兵收屍收到怕　他替長輩送餐反扛千萬債
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 簡竹書, 楊子磊, 林俊耀, 吳偉韶
方荷生以榜首考取中國海專，卻付不出2萬多元學雜費，改讀公立商職，下課後打工。「我跟哥哥要幫忙爸爸，想辦法把家撐起來。」畢業後他離家做過各種工作：餐廳服務生、推銷員、服飾店店長。



老爸一聲吆喝，輕鬆就當選


母親還在世時的珍貴全家福，方荷生排行老二，後排居中。（方荷生提供）

31歲那年他車禍，小腿骨斷一節，住院一個月後與妻子返回老家休養，臥床半年，「起來就胖了20公斤，才會這麼胖。」閒來無事，他找昔日街坊聊天，「長輩怎麼每個腰都彎了，有的還動不了，以前他們都是強壯的中年人。」身體康復，他去夜市擺攤賣小吃、賣花。
1998年他39歲，國民黨推他選里長，沒做任何一支競選旗幟就當選，他說：「我爸爸在社區就像軍團團長，每次投票他就帶著大隊人馬，他說投給誰，大家就投誰。」
起初他不懂當里長，後來父親說，很多長輩需要照顧，他便幫忙申請低收入戶、甚至辦喪事，那幾年，來台老兵開始凋零，南機場公寓不少獨居老兵，有的老兵死在家中多日才被發現，方荷生進屋查看時，「都是小時候就認識的爺爺。」
　
收屍獨死老兵，開啟千萬債
一件、二件、三件…他慌了，跑去問醫生該怎麼辦，醫生建議他替老人家送餐，以此掌握起居。2001年，「我去自助餐店買了一個80元便當，送到周老先生家，收他20元，他覺得划得來。就這樣送到現在。」他說話總是大剌剌，唯獨一談起舊時長輩，聲音就變柔。
他說，送餐不代表長輩就不會死，至今已處理過幾百件喪事，「但我把網絡做起來了，不會讓長輩死在家裡我卻不知道，我送餐的用意在這裡。人死在家中的氣味你聞過就忘不掉，才幾件我就受不了。」
送餐規模越來越大，後來其他里他也送，樹大招風，他被懷疑想選議員，遭檢舉。他解釋，送餐有申請補助，但他不懂細節，並不知道油錢、電話費等行政支出都不能報帳，最後帳兜不起來，「差60萬元，說我貪污，5年60萬元，等於一個月1萬，我要貪污會5年才賺60萬元嗎？」他被罰20萬元，共要繳回80萬元，沒錢，只好拿房子抵押。


忠勤里的食物銀行，符合資格的住戶每月有500點（價值約1,500元），可換取需要的食物。

怎知那成了一個開端，方荷生笑說，後來每次經費不夠，他就去銀行增貸，至今老房子的貸款已達千萬元，一副死豬不怕滾水燙的豁出去口吻。千萬債務是這樣欠下的：2000年他打造樂活園地，接著陸續做兒少課輔、共餐廚房、圖書館、咖啡屋…，他總是自己推坑自己，不停想出新招，如今他每月得自籌50萬元，四處募款仍不夠時，他就增貸。
募款真的累，他說，自己已算有名氣的里長，但每10元開銷中，政府也只補助四元左右，其他里更少。募款得與人搏感情，在台灣就靠敬酒乾杯，早年方荷生的酒量僅一瓶啤酒，現在可是2瓶高粱，「58度的，38度已經沒感覺。」

[The strongest surface in the ground 2] Received fear for the veterans to collect the corpse.
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Jian Zhushu, Yang Zilei, Lin Junyao, Wu Weiwei
Fang Hesheng took the top of the list and took the Chinese Haizhu, but he could not pay more than 20,000 yuan for tuition and fees, read public business, and work after class. ""My brother and I want to help my father and find ways to support my family."" After graduation, he has done various kinds of work from home: restaurant waiter, salesman, clothing store manager.



Dad screamed and was elected easily.


The mother is still a precious family portrait, Fang Hesheng ranks the second child, and the back row is centered. (provided by Fang Hesheng)

When he was 31 years old, he had a car accident and his calf was broken. After he was hospitalized for one month, he returned to his hometown to recuperate. He stayed in bed for half a year. ""Get up to 20 kilograms, it will be so fat."" Nothing to do, he went to the old neighborhood to chat. How did the elders bend every waist, and some of them couldn’t move. They used to be strong middle-aged people.” Physical rehabilitation, he went to the night market to sell snacks and sell flowers.
In 1998, he was 39 years old. The Kuomintang pushed him to the election. He was elected without any election banner. He said: ""My father is in the community like the head of the legion. Every time he votes, he will bring a large team of people. He said Whoever to vote for, everyone will vote.""
At first he didn't know how to be a lieutenant. Later, his father said that many elders need to take care of him. He helped to apply for low-income households and even to do funeral. In those few years, veterans came to Taiwan to die, and many airport residents in South Airport were veterans. The veteran died in the family for many days. When Fang Hesheng entered the house, he was ""a grandfather who knew him when he was a child.""

Collecting dead mortal veterans
One, two, three... He panicked and ran to ask the doctor what to do. The doctor advised him to give food to the elderly to master the living. In 2001, ""I went to the buffet restaurant and bought a 80-yuan lunch. I sent it to Mr. Zhou Lao’s house and collected him 20 yuan. He thought it would be worth it. It was sent to the present."" He always talks loudly, only to talk about it. When the old elders are old, the voice becomes softer.
He said that the delivery of food does not mean that the elders will not die. So far, hundreds of funerals have been dealt with. ""But I have done the Internet and will not let the elders die at home. I don't know. My intention to deliver food is here. The smell of people dying at home can't be forgotten when you smell it. I can't stand it.""
The size of the meal was getting bigger and bigger. Later, he also sent it in the other place. He was tempted to choose a member and was accused. He explained that there was an application for subsidy for food delivery, but he did not understand the details. He did not know that the administrative expenses such as oil money and telephone charges could not be reported. The final account could not be paid. ""The difference is 600,000 yuan, saying that I am corrupt, 5 years 60 Ten thousand yuan, equal to 10,000 a month, I want to earn $600,000 in corruption for five years?"" He was fined 200,000 yuan, and he had to pay back 800,000 yuan. Without money, he had to mortgage the house.


In the food bank of Zhongqin, eligible households have 500 points per month (worth about 1,500 yuan), which can be exchanged for the food they need.

How do you know that it became a beginning? Fang Hesheng said with a smile. Later, every time he was not financially enough, he went to the bank to increase his loan. So far, the loan for the old house has reached 10 million yuan, and a dead pig is not afraid of boiling water. Tens of millions of debts are owed in this way: in 2000, he built a Lok Garden, and then he continued to make small classes, shared kitchens, libraries, coffee houses... He always pushed himself and kept coming up with new ideas. Now, he has to raise 500,000 yuan a month. When the fundraising is still not enough, he will increase his loan.
The fundraising is really tired. He said that he is already a well-known lieutenant, but for every 10 yuan of expenses, the government only subsidizes about four yuan, and the rest is less. Fundraising has to make friends with people. In Taiwan, they rely on toasting and toasting. In the early years, Fang Hesheng’s drink was only a bottle of beer. Now it’s 2 bottles of sorghum. “58 degrees, 38 degrees has not felt.”
