【財經氣象站】川習會因APEC取消延宕　美中貿易協議添市場變數
03 Nov 2019, 22:12 by 理財組
美中有望簽署第一階段貿易協議，英國將於12月提前舉行大選，短線硬脫歐風險降低，美股財報多數優於預期，提振市場風險偏好。此外，聯準會再度降息，雖然聯準會對後續政策態度有所保留，但市場預期仍有寬鬆空間，美債小幅反彈。另外，原油庫存回升，且產油國未加大減產力道，壓抑油價持續下跌。
美股預報：陰天

利多：


低利率環境延續：聯準會如預期降息1碼，政策聲明中放棄了有關「採取適當行動以維持擴張」的措辭，市場解讀聯準會可能一段時間內將按兵不動，直到通膨明顯上揚才會改變。
經濟數據穩健：9月成屋待完成銷售月增1.5%，年增率為6.3%，創4年來最大增幅，美國第3季GDP折合年率成長1.9%，高於預期的1.6%，10月ADP民間就業人口增加12.5萬人，優於預估的11萬人。
企業財報報喜：根據Factset（10月25日）報告，史坦普500大企業四成已公布財報，獲利及營收優於預期比例分別為80%及64%，獲利高出預期幅度達3.8%，其中醫療、通訊、公用事業等防禦型產業為前三高的正成長產業。


不確定性：


美中貿易：原定11月16日至11月17日在智利舉行的APEC峰會，因抗議取消，留意美中雙方是否尋覓到合適地點，後續是否簽署第一階段貿易協議。此外，根據彭博報導，先前中方官員對於全面的長期貿易協議存疑，可觀察11月4日東協峰會、11月5日上海博覽會期間，美中雙方官員是否有相關發言。
英國選舉：英國將於12月12月提前舉行國會大選，11月6日競選活動開始，民調顯示保守黨支持度領先工黨。11月7日為英國央行貨幣政策會議，利率預期維持按兵不動在0.75%。



由於智利突然取消APEC會議，「川習會」何時舉行，攸關美中貿易協議的簽署。


鏡週刊投資建議：

美中貿易情勢持續朝正向發展，加上英國無協議脫歐風險降低，美國重要權值股財報報喜，為全球風險性資產注入強心針。但在美國股市創下歷史新高之際，全球經濟數據及部分財報顯示，貿易紛爭對景氣的負面影響已逐漸顯現，仍須仰賴全球央行的寬鬆貨幣政策，緩解景氣下行風險。
隨著市場已陸續反映對央行寬鬆與貿易協商正向的樂觀期待，投資人仍須慎防高檔震盪。現階段宜採取成長與防禦的多元配置，掌握反彈行情之餘，也能防範潛在震盪風險。

In addition, the United Kingdom has no agreement to reduce the risk of Brexit, and the United States’ important weighted stocks report good news, injecting a strong boost into global risk assets.
