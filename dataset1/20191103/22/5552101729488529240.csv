【通靈檢察官4】她說地檢署廁所有「髒東西」　主任不久被車撞
03 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 林俊宏, 攝影組
桃園地檢署日前剛搬遷到新完工的大樓，很多檢察官還沒進駐前，新的地檢署顯得空蕩，仙姑卻跟一位正準備搬到新辦公室的女檢察官說：「學姐，我去幫妳看過了，裡面還有好幾個人在那裡，要請他們離開。」讓該名不信鬼神之說的女檢氣炸。
巧合的是，仙姑曾指桃檢新大樓的五樓南側廁所有很多「髒東西」，偏偏辦公室靠近該區域的一名主任檢察官後來出車禍，另名檢察官因眼疾開刀住院，有同仁為此還擺了屏風擋煞；就連辦公室冷氣機發出聲響，女檢也稱是「新舊大樓的髒東西在打架」，聽得眾人一頭霧水。

桃園地檢署原本位在桃園市法治路，是早在1973年興建的2層鋼筋磚造建築，40多年來，隨著桃園人口增加，又升格直轄市，辦公廳舍老舊不堪，早已不敷使用，在歷任檢察長努力下，由行政院批准新建地下2層，地上10層的現代化鋼筋混凝土辦公大樓，去年3月15日落成啟用，與昔日老舊辦公廳舍截然不同。
不過，舊桃檢大樓靈異傳聞不斷，20多年前，檢方廳舍中庭曾有出庭被告在大樹下上吊死亡，也有涉及性侵害案的教師被移送地檢署後，當晚就在法警室拘留室自殺身亡，還有被告突然在法警室廁所內嘔吐暴斃，更傳出有書記官半夜加班，看到「好兄弟」，隨著辦公大樓搬遷，昔日傳聞也跟著消失。

The Taoyuan District Inspection Office has just moved to the newly completed building. Many prosecutors have not yet settled in. The new local inspection office appears to be empty. Xiangu said to a female prosecutor who is preparing to move to the new office: ""Sister I went to help you to see it. There are still a few people out there, and I have to ask them to leave."" Let the woman who did not believe in the ghosts blow up.
Coincidentally, Xiangu once said that there was a lot of ""dirty things"" on the south side of the fifth floor of the Taozheng New Building. However, a prosecutor near the office was later involved in a car accident. Another prosecutor was hospitalized for eye diseases. This also puts a screen on the wind; even the office air-conditioner makes a sound, and the female test is also called ""the dirty things in the old and new buildings are fighting"", and everyone is confused.


The psychic female examiner Lin Xinyi was married in a low-key manner in June. Her colleagues and the chief executive did not know. The wedding photos showed her happy marriage. (provided by the reader)

The Taoyuan District Inspection Office was originally located in the legal road of Taoyuan City. It was built in 1973 as a two-story reinforced brick building. For more than 40 years, with the increase of the population of Taoyuan, it has been upgraded to a municipality. The office building is old and unsatisfactory. Use, with the efforts of the procurator-general, the Executive Office approved the construction of a new underground 2 storey, 10-story modern reinforced concrete office building, which was opened on March 15 last year, which is completely different from the old office building.
However, the rumors of the old peach inspection building were continually rumored. More than 20 years ago, the Atrium of the prosecution office had appeared in court and the defendant was hanged under the big tree. After the teacher involved in the sexual assault case was transferred to the local inspection office, he was in the detention room of the police room that night. Suicide was dead, and the defendant suddenly vomited and vomited in the toilet of the police room. It was also reported that the clerk worked overtime in the middle of the night and saw the ""good brothers"". As the office building moved, the old rumors disappeared.
