      <h1>Starving dad asks foodbank for parcels for his kids and refuses help himself</h1>
      <h2>The dad hadn't eaten for three days and his main concern was feeding his children, a foodbank volunteer in Lincolnshire says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T22:48:14+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Ashley Franklin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A starving single dad showed up at a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food-banks">foodbank</a> to get a parcel for his two children and refused food for himself, a volunteer has revealed.</p>
      <p>The dad hadn't eaten for three days and his main concern was feeding his children, said Damon Parkinson, a volunteer at a foodbank in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.</p>
      <p>The case highlights a surge in demand for emergency parcels and shortages of supplies at foodbanks which are under increasing pressure.</p>
      <p>Mr Parkinson told of the heartbreaking moment the starving dad visited the service at Riverside Training after going without food for almost half a week, <a href="https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/heartbreaking-moment-starving-dad-refuses-3489554">LincolnshireLive</a> reports.</p>

      <p>As volunteers were putting together a package for the dad, he told them not to worry about him and to include things his children would enjoy.</p>
      <p>Mr Parkinson said: “We ask about children in the household and whether there are any food allergies or intolerances.</p>
      <p>“He said, 'It doesn’t matter about me, I just need food for the children. Can you give us stuff they will eat?'</p>
      <p>“He hadn’t eaten for three days but still wanted food just for the kids.</p>
      <p>“He was more concerned about them than himself.”</p>

      <p>There have been other worrying cases, Mr Parkinson added.</p>
      <p>A record 1.6million emergency food parcels were given out by the Trussell Trust foodbank network last year.</p>
      <p>More than half a million of them were given to children.</p>
      <p>Mr Parkinson said the service at Riverside Training in Gainsborough has "snowballed" since October last year after a man taking part in an education class didn’t go for a meal when everyone else did.</p>
      <p>He said: “We didn’t realise the scale of the issue – it’s a hidden issue.</p>

      <p>“A learner didn’t leave for lunch when all the others left. He sat there.</p>
      <p>“We had a conversation with him and he said he had not had breakfast but said ‘I am ok’.</p>
      <p>“We asked him what the last thing he had to eat was. He said ‘I had a slice of toast yesterday morning’.</p>
      <p>“From there we got a few items for learners not eating to try and support them to continue with their education and courses.”</p>
      <p>The service links those in need with other services they may require, including education courses and appointments related to mental health.</p>
      <p>One man who was referred was considering suicide, said Mr Parkinson.</p>
      <p>He added: "People have an image of what someone not eating looks like.</p>
      <p>“It is not necessarily someone who is unemployed or an addict – it could be anyone.</p>
      <p>“We have had single parents, people with low-paid jobs – it is not a stereotypical person.</p>
      <p>“For me it makes you realise how quickly life can turn upside down."</p>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> turning colder, the foodbank is seeing more people coming in looking for parcels, but its supplies are running low.</p>
      <p>Foodbanks across the UK have put out calls for donations and volunteers ahead of a busy season which includes Christmas.</p>
