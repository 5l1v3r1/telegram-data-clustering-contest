      <p>(Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China’s Huawei Technologies Co will come “very shortly,” in an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ross said the licenses “will be forthcoming very shortly” and that the U.S. government had received 206 requests.</p>
      <p>“That’s a lot of applications - it’s frankly more than we would’ve thought,” Ross added.</p>
      <p>Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>In May, Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment provider, was put under a U.S. blacklist citing national security concerns, effectively banning it from buying American-made parts without a special license, while U.S. companies were banned from selling to Huawei without carrying a special license.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump promised in June to provide some relief to firms that did business with Huawei.</p>
      <p>On U.S.-China trade developments, Ross said there was no reason the deal could not be on track to be signed this month.</p>
      <p>“We are in good shape, we are making good progress, and there is no natural reason why it could not be,” Bloomberg quoted Ross as saying.</p>
