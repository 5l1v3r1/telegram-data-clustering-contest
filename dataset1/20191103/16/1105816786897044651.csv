After frequent reported cases of Pakistani diplomats’ harassment in Afghanistan, the Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday summoned the Afghan chargé d’affaires to convey serious concerns over the safety and security of embassy personnel in Kabul and its sub-missions.
According to a statement issued by the FO, Pakistani diplomats were obstructed by Kabul officials on roads, often hit by anonymous motorcycles while heading towards Pakistani Embassy from their residencies in the capital city.



With hindrances in commutation, Pakistani diplomats have also launched their complaints against the hurling of inappropriate remarks and usage of abusive language throughout their confrontations with Afghan officials.
In the light of Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities 1961, the chargé d’affaires was reminded about the responsibility of the Afghan government to ensure safety, security and freedom of movement to all members of the mission.
He was asked to convey to the Afghan authorities to immediately investigate the incidents and share the report with Pakistan.
The Afghan official also urged to take necessary measures to guard against the recurrence of such incidents in the future.
