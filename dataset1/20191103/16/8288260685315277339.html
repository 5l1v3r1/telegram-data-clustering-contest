      <p>Daniel Craig has insisted he isn't "grumpy" despite his reputation - but admitted he doesn't do much to try and change people's perception.</p>
      <p>The James Bond star, 51, said he actually loves what he does but that when he was growing up people trying to be artists didn't seek approval.</p>
      <p>Discussing how he is perceived, Craig told The Sunday Times Culture: "I don't do much to dispel it, because I'd just be chasing my tail to prove that I'm not the person people think I am.</p>
      <p>"You know, I probably don't have a particularly good public persona.</p>
      <p>"Some do. Some can go on talk shows and tell stories, but I'm just not wired that way. I don't know what to say.</p>
      <p>"I can try, but people would go, 'What's he doing?' They'd go, 'Where is the grumpy f*****?"'</p>

      <p>He added: "But I'm not grumpy. Genuinely, I'm not... I love what I do."</p>
      <p>The 007 star went on: "But I just grew up in an era when, if you were trying to be an artist, you didn't look for approval. You didn't look for likes.</p>
      <p>"You just did your thing. And this? This is what I do.</p>
      <p>"Who am I personally? It has nothing to do with anybody, except for the people in my life."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The actor is set to reprise the role of the suave spy in new film No Time To Die, which is due to be released next year.</p>
      <p>The film will be Craig's fifth and reportedly final outing as Bond.</p>
      <p>He said the cast and crew are "pulling out all the stops" for the eagerly anticipated film.</p>
      <p>"We're trying to make the best f****** Bond movie we can," he said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Pulling out all the stops.</p>
      <p>"If we aim for the stars, we might hit the treetops."</p>
