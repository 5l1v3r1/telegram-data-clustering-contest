      <p>BEIRUT (AP) â€” The Latest on anti-government protests in Lebanon (all times local):</p>
      <p>6:45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of Lebanese have packed into central Beirut for the biggest anti-government demonstration since supporters of the militant Hezbollah group rampaged through their main protest site last week.</p>
      <p>The demonstration on Sunday came hours after a much smaller rally of thousands was held in support of Lebanon's president and foreign minister, two of the main targets of the anti-government protests, which first erupted Oct. 17.</p>
      <p>The protesters called for a general strike Monday and for the government to speed up the political transition following Prime Minister Saad Hariri's resignation last week.</p>
      <p>The protesters are calling for sweeping changes to the political system established after the 1975-1990 civil war. President Michel Aoun, his son-in-law, Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, and other political leaders have refused the protesters' demands to resign. Aoun and Bassil are members of a Christian party allied with the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has accused foreign powers of manipulating the protests.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Hezbollah supporters rampaged through the main protest site on Tuesday, tearing down tents and setting them on fire. Hariri resigned hours later.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>1:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people are marching to show their support for Lebanon's president and his proposed political reforms.</p>
      <p>The demonstration near Michel Aoun's presidential palace in southeastern Beirut comes after more than two weeks of widespread anti-government demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Another such anti-government protest is scheduled for later Sunday in central Beirut.</p>
      <p>These demonstrations have united people from the country's many religious sects and factions against the political class.</p>
      <p>Those leaders have ruled Lebanon since the 1975-1990 civil war, and are widely seen as having tanked the economy.</p>
      <p>Aoun, one of the main targets of the protesters' anger, gave a speech late Thursday proposing that Lebanon should move away from the decades-old sectarian political system. He said the country is at a "dangerous crossroads."</p>
