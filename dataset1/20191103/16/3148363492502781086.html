      <h1>Italian Far-Leftists Arrested for Illegally Giving Migrants Public Apartments</h1>
      <h2>Police have arrested five members of a far-left extremist group in Milan after they broke into vacant public housing and illegally gave it away to migrants.</h2>

      <p>The five individuals, three Italian nationals, a Romanian, and an Angolan, are members of the far-left Autonomous Committee of Ambitanti Barona (CAAB). CAAB claims to fight against evictions and for the right to housing,<i> Il Giornale</i> <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/picchiavano-chi-disobbediva-arrestati-5-membri-caab-1777892.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Police allege that the group broke into uninhabited publically-owned apartments and then illegally assigned them to migrants. The new occupants pay the group between €700 and €1,400 in what investigators have labelled as bribes.</p>
      <p>The migrants, who mostly come from non-European Union states, were also expected to take part in demonstrations against evictions and were often at the front of protests in which the group clashed with Milan police.</p>
      <p>Investigators were tipped off to the group’s activities by a 43-year-old Moroccan migrant who had become disillusioned with CAAB’s activities and stopped showing up to demonstrations and meetings.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the migrant was called on by members of CAAB to explain his absence and lack of communication. He was then allegedly physically attacked until another man, a 32-year-old, defended him.</p>
      <p>CAAB <a href="https://www.facebook.com/comitatoautonomoabitantibarona/posts/2451916008429273">responded</a> to the arrests, calling them a “political attack” and claimed that the Moroccan started the physical altercation.</p>
      <p>“As the Barona Autonomous Committee, we reject every single accusation and send it back to the sender: occupying houses for money is a mafia practice, which speculates on people’s problems, and we fight it every day,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>Public housing for migrants has been a significant issue in many Italian cities, including in Sesto San Giovanni. Earlier this year, the city’s right-wing Mayor Roberto Di Stefano <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/05/right-wing-mayor-gives-italians-apartments-predecessor-gave-foreigners/">reversed a leftist policy</a> of giving migrants priority for housing over local Italians.</p>
