      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Marathoner Steve Goldfarb is running his first marathon since having back surgery less than one year ago.</p>
      <p>Right after he ran last year's TCS New York City marathon, the 60-year-old Brooklynite decided he couldn't take his back pain any longer.</p>
      <p>And so began his quest to find the right doctor to perform his surgery.</p>
      <p>"The first doctor I went to was just going to prescribe opioids," said Steve. "The second doctor I went to said that I wouldn't be able to run again."</p>
      <p>In fact, Dr. Sheeraz Qureshi at Manhattan's Hospital for Special Surgery was the fourth doctor Steve visited. But his persistence paid off.</p>
      <p>"I basically left the hospital using a walker," Goldfarb said. "I was anxious to get started with my running."</p>
      <p>Thanks to his determination and his doctor's help, Steve is back to run the New York City marathon on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"We chose a minimally invasive approach in Steve's condition because we knew the level of activity that he was used to," said Qureshi.</p>
      <p>The doctors placed spacers in between Goldfarb's vertebrae and held everything in place with screws and rods.</p>
      <p>"Steve still has some follow up tests here, an x-ray and a CT scan, to make sure the surgery is holding."</p>
      <p>Despite the surgery and his own team's hard work, Qureshi says that the biggest key to Steve's success is one thing: Steve.</p>
      <p>"I did want to set realistic expectations, but I felt that Steve had such a commitment to get back. If any patient was going to be able to do it, it was going to be him," he said.</p>
      <p>It's not every day can a runner get back in action so soon after having major surgery. But for Steve Goldfarb, he agrees he's like a bionic man now, ready to take his mark.</p>
