“When I was in college, my brother was telling me, ‘You got that Jon Jones attitude,’” he said. “When he was the youngest champ. Like, ‘You don’t give a f—k,’ this, and this, and but be respectful.
“And I get to a level where I realize what he thought he was, and it pisses me off. I’m apologizing now for my actions because if there are any kids out there watching, I want them to know that I was wrong. I don’t want you to do that. I want you to be a sport about it.”
Anderson went as far as calling Jones a “fraud”, while still seemingly holding grudges for the UFC 232 mess that caused him and his wife a lot of inconvenience and trouble.
“So to be at a level where I can see the way he acts and the way he treats people and all that different stuff, and now knowing his personal life is aired out, it’s kind of like, ‘Bro, you were just a fraud,” he said of Jones. “All those years that I thought you were the one, you were a fraud.’ And I want to be the one that the kids will look up to, a true champ. Professional.

“I’m not gonna be entitled, I don’t think I deserve anything different than anybody else. I’m gonna be professional and treat everybody the same. And that’s the way it should be for everybody.”
Anderson is now on a four-fight win streak, as he improves to a record of 13-4 (with five wins by knockout). He also took home an extra $50,000 for Performance of the Night honors.
