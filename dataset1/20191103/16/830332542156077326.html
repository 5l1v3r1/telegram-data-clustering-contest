      <p>HOUGHTON, Mich. - The longtime superintendent of Isle Royale National Park in Michigan is retiring.</p>
      <p>Phyllis Green stepped down Friday as head of the remote park in northwestern Lake Superior. She held the position for 18 years. It was her final stop in a 41-year career with the federal government that also included posts with the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
      <p>At Isle Royale, Green oversaw the first stages of a continuing project to restore the gray wolf population by relocating animals from the mainland.</p>
      <p>The native of Houghton, Michigan, also led efforts to prevent exotic species in ship ballast tanks from infesting waters near the island park.</p>
      <p>Green worked to upgrade visitor facilities and equip the park with solar power while protecting its wilderness character.</p>
