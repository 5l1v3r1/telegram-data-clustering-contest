      <h1>Weeks After Breaking His Pelvis, Former President Jimmy Carter Is Back to Teaching Sunday School</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T16:39:53+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(PLAINS, Ga.) â€” Former President Jimmy Carter is back at church teaching Sunday school less than two weeks after breaking his pelvis in a fall.</p>
      <p>The 95-year-old Democrat used a walker to slowly enter the crowded sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church in the southwest Georgia town of Plains on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He sat on a motorized lift chair at the front of the room to teach a 45-minute lesson on life after death. More than 400 people were on hand.</p>
      <p>Carter was briefly hospitalized and has since been recovering at home since fracturing his pelvis on Oct. 21. He also fell a few days before that and needed stitches above his left eye.</p>
      <p>Carter is the oldest U.S. ex-President ever and has been teaching Bible lessons since he was in his teens.</p>
