      <p>Lebanese President Michel Aoun said Sunday that a three-point plan had been drawn up around tackling corruption, restoring the economy, and building a civil state.<br/><br/>Aoun, who must now hold consultations with members of parliament to designate a new premier following the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, said: "These three points are not easily achieved, we need your efforts, and we need a square filled both by you and the (anti-government) protesters to defend your rights.<br/><br/>"Many are trying to be obstructive. This is why we need to make a huge effort," said Aoun in a televised speech, addressing his supporters who converged on the presidential palace in Baabda to back him.<br/><br/>Hariri resigned on Tuesday following unprecedented nationwide protests.<br/><br/>Aoun has signaled support for a more technocratic government, saying in a speech after Hariri's resignation that ministers should be chosen "according to their competencies and expertise, not political loyalties."<br/><br/>Hariri's government has continued in a caretaker capacity until a new one is formed.<br/><br/>In his speech on Sunday, Aoun described corruption, a primary protestor grievance, as having become "nested" in the state.<br/><br/>Foreign Minister Jebran Bassil, Aoun's son-in-law and an object of ridicule by anti-government protesters, addressed supporters at the rally, pledging to root out corruption and hold all who had taken state funds accountable.<br/><br/>"Be careful, we have long and difficult days ahead of us. We were racing against time to prevent a collapse but the corruption, squandering (of resources) and public debt beat us."</p>
