      <h1>Michael Owen and Peter Schmeichel in heated TV debate over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United players had the discussion after the Red Devils had lost 1-0 to Bournemouth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T16:26:41+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United players Michael Owen and Peter Schmeichel were involved in a heated studio debate over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's role as Red Devils manager on Saturday.</p>
      <p>United went down 1-0 at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> to slide down to 10th place in the Premier League table having won just three of their 11 top-flight games this season.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is facing mounting pressure on his role at Old Trafford, and the two ex-United players - who were working on the game as pundits for Premier League Productions - disagree over his progress as a manager ever since he replaced Jose Mourinho in the hotseat in December last year.</p>

      <p>"I’m a patient person myself but if Jurgen Klopp or if Pep Guardiola were manager of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , then I’m certain you would have seen a huge improvement with what they’ve got,” said Owen, who spent three years at Old Trafford between 2009 and 2012.</p>
      <p>"You look at the other two teams - Guardiola and Klopp get the best (out of them).</p>
      <p>"You name a player out of those two squads that hasn’t got better under the management, under the guidance of them.”</p>

      <p>However Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles with United, says that Klopp and Guardiola have been working with a more talented squad.</p>
      <p>“I have to disagree a little bit with that," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think Jurgen Klopp, he’s got very, very few players in his team that were there when he started. He’s got (Jordan) Henderson..."</p>
      <p>Owen then replied with: “What was Henderson like five years ago? Everyone was laughing him out of town, now everyone’s saying he’s world class."</p>

      <p>Schmeichel then reiterated his idea that the Manchester City and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> managers have the benefit of time on their side.</p>
      <p>“(That’s) five years in," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Now, Guardiola in the first year wasn’t great, people forgot that. He changed the whole back five, he didn’t play (Vincent) Kompany in the second year, didn’t play him at all.</p>

      <p>"Obviously he came back in the third year but he changed the whole back five, he bought players like Bernardo Silva in. He has changed that team a lot and it has taken him time to get to that point.</p>
      <p>"Now, Ole’s starting point was nowhere near what Guardiola came into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> with."</p>
      <p>Liverpool and City remain the top two in the Premier League, and meet at Anfield next weekend.</p>
