      <h1>Protesters gather at gender identity speaker’s Vancouver talk despite location switch</h1>
      <h2>Some protesters carried signs proclaiming that ‘Trans rights are human rights’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T16:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of protesters gathered outside the venue of a panel discussion on gender and sexuality — the location of which was kept secret until shortly before the event due to security concerns.</p>
      <p>Police stood in front of the doors of the Pan Pacific Vancouver hotel where the talk took place in an event space and prevented a group of peaceful protesters from entering.</p>
      <p>They chanted, played music and held up signs — sometimes making noise loud enough to be heard three floors up when the event doors would open.</p>
      <p>Some protesters carried signs proclaiming that “Trans rights are human rights” and “Trans women are women.”</p>
      <p>The event was originally scheduled to take place at Simon Fraser University, but was moved after the senior director of campus security said there was a high safety concern.</p>
      <p>The talk included Meghan Murphy, a freelance writer who opposes trans rights, saying they threaten the rights of cisgender women.</p>
      <p>Her talk at a Toronto library at the end of October drew several hundred protesters, and the Toronto Public Library faced intense criticism for booking the room to the hosts.</p>
      <p>Ticketholders to the Vancouver event learned of the new location at the Pan Pacific Vancouver hotel in an email.</p>
      <p>The message assured attendees that a combination of hotel and the event’s security, as well as a police presence “will make this a safe event.”</p>
      <p>Temporary gates were erected to prevent unauthorized access to the space, while several police officers and private security workers were on hand. They checked the bags of people allowed in.</p>
      <p>Inside, the event went mostly undisturbed. After the talk concluded, attendees were escorted through a different exit in an effort to avoid protesters.</p>
