      <p>Elon Musk has apparently added $2 billion to his net worth after the electric car maker Tesla posted surprise profits.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old Tesla CEO and co-founder owns about 22 percent of the company’s outstanding stock. Tesla’s shares rose by 24 percent in the week after it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201810251069207294-tesla-profit-quarter/">reported third-quarter adjusted earnings</a> per share of $1.86 and $312 million in profit – after losing a total of $1.1 billion in the previous two quarters.</p>
      <p>Wall Street analysts had projected a loss of 46 cents per share, so Tesla’s stock price skyrocketed, meaning that Musk’s net worth grew by nearly $2 billion to $22.9 billion. </p>
      <p>He is now ranked the 21st richest person in the world, according to the Forbes 400 list, right between chocolate tycoon John Mars and hedge fund manager Jim Simons.</p>
      <p>Musk — <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077204749-tesla-chief-elon-musk-says-he-is-quitting-twitter/">currently on a break from Twitter</a> — also owns an estimated $12.5 billion stake in the rocket company SpaceX.</p>
