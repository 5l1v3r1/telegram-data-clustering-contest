There is a strong focus on quality training and upskilling job seekers as we are committed to supporting the Sultanate’s economy and diversifying our support beyond our boundaries to other economic sectors.”<br/><br/>Several government dignitaries attended the ceremony held at the PDO’s Knowledge World venue in Muscat, including Dr Muna Al Jardaniyah, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Manpower for Technical Education and Vocational Training, and Eng.
