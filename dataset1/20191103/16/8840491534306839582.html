      <p>ANOTHER date with the current Galway, Connaught and All-Ireland champions, Corofin, was the prize for Ballintubber who eased through their quarterfinal clash against Glencar-Manorhamilton at a wet and slippery Elverys MacHale Park, Castlebar, this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It finished 1-11 to 0-9 in favour of the Mayo champions who were never under pressure and that was without their talismanic Cillian O’Connor who was absent.</p>
      <p>The first half was evenly contested in very difficult conditions with Ballintubber just nosing ahead by 0-6 to 0-5 at the break.</p>
      <p>However, the game lurched dramatically in favour of the Mayo champions inside two minutes of the restart with Alan Plunkett finding the net with the only goal of the game.</p>
      <p>To rub even more salt into the wound, the Leitrim champions were reduced to 14 men in the 34th minute when a second yellow card saw Killian McGriskin take the long walk and with him went any slim chance the visitors had of causing an upset.</p>
      <p>If it is any consolation for the visitors they had the best player on show with corner forward Conor Dolan scoring 0-6 and putting in a huge performance, but Ballintubber always had the edge in experience and craft and dominated around the middle thanks to Jason Gibbons and Diarmuid O’Connor.</p>
      <p>Alan Dillon, Gibbons, Stephen O’Malley (three frees) and Ciaran Gavin, who scored for point (two frees) in that first half, were superb for the champions who now face Corofin in a repeat of last year’s final.</p>
      <p>That was in Castlebar but they must now travel to Tuam on Sunday for the semi-final knowing they will need to improve if they are to take another big step towards winning their first ever Connaught title.</p>
