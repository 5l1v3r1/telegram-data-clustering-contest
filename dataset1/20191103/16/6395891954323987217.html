      <p><b>NEW YORK (AP)</b> - Manuela Schär of Switzerland has won her third straight women's wheelchair title at the New York City Marathon, giving her eight consecutive marathon major victories.</p>
      <p>After rolling ahead of the record pace for much of Sunday's race, Schär crossed the finish about a minute off the mark at 1 hour, 44 minutes and 20 seconds.</p>
      <p>Daniel Romanchuk of the United States repeated as men's wheelchair champion in another tight finish over Switzerland's Marcel Hug.</p>
      <p>Romanchuk held off Hug with a final sprint through Central Park, crossing the finish line in 1 hour, 37 minutes and 24 seconds. Hug was one second behind for a second straight year, and Germany's David Weir and American Aaron Pike were also within 10 seconds.</p>
      <p>Last year, Romanchuk became the first American and youngest competitor to win the men's division as a 20-year-old. He followed with victories this year at the Boston and London Marathons. Hug took the New York title in 2016 and 2017.</p>
