      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Senior leader of PTI Jahangir Tareen on Sunday said government has not stopped Azadi March at any point so opposition must stuck to the agreement.</p>
      <p>Addressing to media in Lahore, he said Shehbaz Sharif has always spoken big words but this government is correcting the things that were badly dealt in previous regimes.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Tareen said there are reports of huge funding for the Azadi March of JUI-F.</p>
      <p>Talking in Dunya News program ‘Dunya kamran Khan Kay Sath,’ he said such things could not happen without resources and we know from where the funds are coming.</p>
      <p>He said traders did not give a single penny for Azadi March but JUI-F must explain about funding as it would raise questions. He said Maulana Fazlur Rehman could not get public fame and government would not create hurdles for the marchers.</p>
      <p>Tareen said we wish people use their democratic right and government would act responsibly, adding that roads leading to Red Zone would be blocked.</p>
