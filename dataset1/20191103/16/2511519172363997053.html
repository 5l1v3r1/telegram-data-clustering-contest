      <p>During the annual celebration of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/dia-de-los-muertos">Dia de los Muertos</a>, people in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mexico">Mexico</a>, Latin America and across the world commemorate the lives of loved ones who have passed away.</p>
      <p>Ofrendas (altars) are set up in homes of members of the Mexican community, where photographs of the deceased and items such as their favourite foods are placed in honour of their memory.</p>
      <p>Public celebrations also take place, including parades featuring large skeletal figures, traditional dancers and a plethora of extravagantly dressed participants and spectators.</p>

      <p>The theme of the event was monarch butterflies, which are believed by those who observe Dia de los Muertos to hold the spirits of the people in their lives who they have lost.</p>
      <p>A march titled “March of the Catrinas” was held in Mexico City to raise awareness of and protest against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/femicide">femicide</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/violence-against-women">violence towards women</a> in the country.</p>
      <p>Many of the female marchers wore “skull candy” make-up and carried pink crucifixes inscribed with messages including “ni una más” (not one more) and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/vivasnosqueremoscomunidad/">vivas nos queremos</a>“ (we want ourselves to be alive).</p>
