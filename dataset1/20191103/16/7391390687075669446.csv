He came in with that voice and that timing and he made every scene better. And weirder. Every moment was completely unique.""
The Palladinos went on to note that in addition to being a brilliant actor and comedian, Tarantina was a unique presence who will be missed, writing, ""You can’t describe a guy like Brian, you just had to be there. And lucky for us, we were. We love him and will forever miss him.""
Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Midge Maisel, also paid tribute to Tarantina with a post on Instagram. ""He was hilarious and talented and kind and an all around golden f*cking weirdo. Our family of weirds won't be the same without him,"" she wrote in part.



Amy and Daniel Palladino have cast Tarantina in prior projects as well. From 2001-2002, Tarantina appeared in Gilmore Girls, playing Bootsy, owner of the Stars Hollow newsstand. In 2016, the actor also appeared in the series' revival Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.
Tarantina's career spanned decades, and the character actor appeared in a variety of other movies and television shows over the years, including The Good Wife, BlacKkKlansman, Law & Order: SVU, Heroes, The Sopranos, and Miami Vice, according to IMDb.
