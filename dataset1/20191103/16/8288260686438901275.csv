Liverpool fans want to see John McGinn at Anfield after Saturday’s 2-1 victory against Aston Villa.
The Reds took all three points so extend their lead at the top of the Premier League, coming from behind after Trezeguet had fired Villa into a first-half lead.
Late goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane turned the game on its head and Jurgen Klopp’s side now have a six-point advantage over Manchester City.
But it was Villa midfielder McGinn who caught the eye of plenty of Liverpool supporters.

The Scotland international was a stand-out performer, driving Villa forward in the absence of Jack Grealish who missed out through injury.
He’s impressed all season after helping Villa to win promotion – and Manchester United are said to be keeping tabs on his performances.
McGinn is said to be valued at around £60m and Dean Smith said last month: “The big clubs can come calling but they’ll get a short, swift reply! He’s a player we want here at Aston Villa.”

But that hasn’t put off Liverpool fans who think the 25-year-old should be a target for their side. Here’s what they have been saying:
@Redxabi141: Liverpool needs to look at McGinn as a long term Milly (Milner) replacement. Quality player!
@Jell_1982: Thought Villa were excellent yesterday. Yes we created a lot of chances but they didn’t just put 11 behind the ball. McGinn looks a top player.
@Kev_Charlton: Credit to Villa, they were good. McGinn would be a great signing for us to add to the Scottish contingent (of 1). Absolutely amazing end to the game, Trent class all game.
 
@Dantunna: McGinn would be a great signing for #LFC to replace Lallana, who is likely to leave at the end of the season.
@Nayanmoha: John McGinn better than all our three midfielders.
