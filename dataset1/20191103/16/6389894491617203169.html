      <h1>Boris Johnson feels 'deep regret' for missing his 31 October Brexit deadline</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T16:13:41+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan Boscia</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has apologised to Conservative party members for not fulfilling his 31 October “do or die” Brexit pledge.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister continually claimed he would not ask for a Brexit extension, saying “he would rather die in a ditch” than ask Brussels to extend the 31 October deadline.</p>

      <p>When asked by Sky News’ Sophy Ridge this morning if he would apologise to Tory members who voted for him to be leader, he responded: “Of course…it’s a matter of deep regret.”</p>
      <p>He said the fault for the delay lay with parliament for not voting through his deal in his specified timeframe and for passing the so-called Benn act.</p>
      <p>However, when asked if he accepted some responsibility, Johnson said: “I do and I’m deeply, deeply disappointed.”</p>
      <p>Johnson also denied any need to extend the transition period past December 2020 if his Brexit deal passes through parliament.</p>
      <p>If the Conservatives win a majority, and then pass the Prime Minister’s deal, it would give the UK one year to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>
      <p>It took Canada and Japan six and seven years respectively to broker a free trade deal.</p>
      <p>Johnson refused definitively to rule out that there would be no extension, but said there is “no reason whatever” to extend the transition period.</p>
      <p>He added the trade negotiations with the EU “should be extremely simple.”</p>
      <p>He said: “We already have zero tariffs and zero quotas.</p>
      <p>“We already have regulatory and legislative alignment.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>One trade expert immediately dismissed this claim as “unrealistic”.</p>
      <p>David Henig, UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy and trade, said it was: “Not only unrealistic, but bad for UK – [it] would give us 10 months to decide many years of future economic policy.”</p>
