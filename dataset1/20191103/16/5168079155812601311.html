      <p>Located in Mabela, Al Sahwa Public Garden is a great location for the entire family, and reminds us in many ways of our childhood. Vast expanses of freshly-mown green grass provide ample opportunity for children to play to their heart’s content, while the beautifully manicured landscape is sure to be appreciated by the adults.<br/><br/>Covering an area of nearly 300,000 square metres, and located next to the Burj A’Sahwa roundabout and the Sahwa clock tower, the park also features a plethora of play areas, picnic spots, gazebos and running paths. Six gardens that have been created in the Islamic style are the centrepiece of the park.<br/><br/>There is ample parking for those who wish to come to the park, while regular Mwasalat buses will take you as far as Burj A’Sahwa. However, Muscat Municipality recently decided to introduce paid parking to those who came to Al Sahwa Park, after they found out that many people were using their parking spaces for free, without actually visiting it.</p>

      <p>“In its quest to tackle random behaviour affecting the general appearance in the Wilayat, and in pursuit of the public interest, the General Directorate of Muscat Municipality in As Seeb has decided to tow away the long-term vehicles left at As`Sahwa park within the prescribed time limit given to owners,” said Bushra Al Busaidiyah of Muscat Municipality.<br/><br/>“The municipality has put some warning stickers on vehicles that have been parked for the long-term, giving their owners a deadline. Automatic gates will also be installed at the park, which will be opened automatically during the allowed visiting hours. The park doors will be opened every day from 4pm to midnight, and on Fridays, Saturdays and official holidays from 9am to 12 at night,” she added.<br/><br/><br/><br/>“The municipality decided to install the automatic gates due to the need to tackle the increasing number of abandoned vehicles that have been left at the park for a long time at the park,” said Bushra Al Busaidiyah. “These vehicles do distort the beauty of the green landscapes and they are prone to accumulation of dust and dirt, besides the large space they use in the park.”</p>
