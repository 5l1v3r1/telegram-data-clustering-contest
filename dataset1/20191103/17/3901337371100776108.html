      <h1>Pirates Star’s Worst PSL Season Ever…    </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T17:23:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>An Orlando Pirates player is on his way to having the worst season ever in the Absa Premiership due to lack of game time. </p>
      <p>Tebogo Tlolane, who is in his first season with the Buccaneers, is yet to start a match for the team, having only made one substitute appearance so far in the campaign. </p>

      <p>However, with Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena using a rotation policy in selecting matchday squads for the different matches, Tlolane can be hopeful that he will get his chance to play at some point under the club’s coach.  </p>
      <p>And why is Tlolane heading for his worst season?    </p>
      <p>During his time with Chippa United last season, the left-back amassed 29 appearances – all starts – from the first match up to the 29th.  </p>
      <p>The only match he missed was the last one of the season against Kaizer Chiefs, only because he was suspended due to having picked four yellow cards. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Messi, as Tlolane is known in football circles, made a total of 34 appearances (all starts) in all competitions for the Port Elizabeth side, which was the highest number for the club by a single player.</p>
      <p>However, last season was the player’s first in Mzansi’s topflight, having joined the Chilli Boys from Jomo Cosmos in the National First Division.      </p>
      <p>At only 24 years of age, Tlolane will know that his time to shine again will come again, and can only wait for it for now.   </p>
