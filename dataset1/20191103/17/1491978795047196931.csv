World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont believes the Japan tournament will ‘probably be remembered as the greatest Rugby World Cup’.
“We’ve broken records at every level,” said Beaumont a day after South Africa sealed Rugby World Cup glory in Yokohama. “Attendances, fan zones, broadcast, digital and social media.”
Beaumont also revealed the World Rugby Council has approved the implementation of a dual-host selection process for the tournaments in 2027 and 2031, beginning next year.
