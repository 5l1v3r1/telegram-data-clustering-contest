      <p>(CNN) - After 48 years, El Al is retiring its 747 fleet -- and to say goodbye, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/el-al-airlines-aviation-collector-marvin-goldman/index.html">Israel's national carrier</a> used a flight tracker to "draw" the plane in the skies over the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
      <p>Departing from<a href="https://cnn.com/travel/destinations/rome"> Rome</a> at 10am local time on Sunday, the <a href="https://cnn.com/travel/article/boeing-747-jumbo-jet-travel/index.html">Boeing 747 Jumbo</a> took a one-time flightpath to create the shape commemorating El Al's final commercial 747 flight.</p>
      <p>According to the airline, Flight LY1747 began "painting" two hours after take-off, as the plane flew above southern <a href="http://www.cnn.com/travel/amp/cyprus-best-things/index.html">Cyprus</a>.</p>
      <p>Flight LY1747 descended to 10,000 feet to begin the artwork, according to flight tracking service FlightRadar24, which documented the trip in a series of images posted to its Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>The aircraft flew for just under four hours before landing in Tel Aviv, according to the tracker.</p>
      <p>Known as the "Queen of the Skies," the first Boeing 747 made its maiden flight on February 9, 1969.</p>
      <p>A year later, the plane entered service with Pan American World Airways; it has been a passenger favourite ever since.</p>
      <p>There are close to 500 747s still flying, although many airlines are now replacing their passenger 747s with larger, more advanced, and more efficient twin-engine planes.</p>
      <p>El Al said it <a href="https://www.elal.com/en/More-Info/Pages/hp/747.aspx">had flown many different 747 models</a> in its five decades using the jet, but is now replacing them with a <a href="https://www.elal.com/en/About-ELAL/About-ELAL/News/Pages/DreamLiner-120617.aspx">new fleet of 787 Dreamliners</a>.</p>
