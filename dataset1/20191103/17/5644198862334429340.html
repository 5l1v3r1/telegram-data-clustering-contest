      <p>BANGKOK: The signing of the world's largest trade pact will likely be kicked back to 2020, according to a draft statement by Southeast Asian leaders, delaying a deal craved by China to offset a painful tariff war with the US.</p>
      <p>The 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) spans from India to New Zealand and includes 30 per cent of global GDP and half of the world's people.</p>

      <p>Objections by India have dashed hopes of finalising the pact at this weekend's Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Bangkok, where members of the 10-nation bloc have been joined by the premiers of India and China.</p>
      <p>"Most market access negotiations have been completed and the few outstanding bilateral issues will be resolved by Feb 2020," said a draft agreement obtained by AFP.</p>
      <p>Negotiations have sputtered for several years, but the statement said the text of all 20 chapters was now complete "pending the resolution of one" member, believed to be India.</p>
      <p>But it said all members were "committed to sign the RCEP" next year in Vietnam, which will take over the ASEAN chair.</p>
      <p>New Delhi is worried its small businesses will be hard hit by any flood of cheap Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi repeated his country's concerns during talks with ASEAN leaders on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Modi said India's unresolved issues include "meaningful market access for all parties", according to a diplomat who attended the meeting, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Beijing sees RCEP as a central pillar of its trade strategy for its Asian neighbourhood, and it is backed by the leaders of ASEAN and who represent a 650 million-strong market.</p>
      <p>Concluding the deal has been made more pressing by the brutal tit-for-tat trade war with the US, which has chipped back at growth in China, the world's second-largest economy.</p>

      <p>RCEP - which includes the 10-nation ASEAN bloc along with China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - accounts for 40 per cent of global commerce.</p>
      <p>The tariffs lobbed by the US and China on billions of dollars worth of each others' goods could drag growth to the lowest rate in over a decade, according to the IMF.</p>
      <p>That has spooked Asia-Pacific economies and - with the exception of India - sharpened the focus on getting the RCEP deal over the line.</p>
      <p>"In just the past two years new protectionism measures have affected nearly US$1 trillion of world trade," New Zealand premier Jacinda Ardern told a business meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.</p>
      <p>"We've been a strong proponent for concluding a high quality RCEP as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump said he hopes to sign a deal with China's Xi Jinping in order to roll back some of the tariffs, telling reporters over the weekend an agreement could be signed in the US state of Iowa.</p>
      <p>Chinese premier Li Keqiang said earlier in the day his country remained "firmly committed to supporting ASEAN centrality" as part of its regional ties.</p>
      <p>He is expected to drive the case for RCEP when member states meet on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Li also professed Beijing's readiness "to work" with ASEAN states on a code of conduct (CoC) in the contested South China Sea.</p>
      <p>China, which says the most of resource-laden sea is its own, is accused of aggression and building military outposts in waters claimed by several rival states.</p>
      <p>Li described the first reading of the code as "a very important landmark" and committed to a timeline to settle on the wording of the agreement by 2021.</p>
      <p>The sea, one of the world's major trade passageways, is considered a flashpoint between China and rival claimants with the US also desperate to keep the waterway open to its vessels.</p>
      <p>Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte welcomed the progress of the painstakingly established code but said more needed to be done.</p>
      <p>"Let us get this job done sooner than later as we are given the assurance of tranquillity of the area," he said.</p>
