Flights at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were temporarily halted after a threatening note was reportedly found on an American Airlines flight.
The details of the note have not been revealed, but the Atlanta Police Department confirmed that they investigated the incident. Passengers on the flight were reportedly deplaned and rescreened at the gate before airport operations returned to normal.



The incident occurred early on Saturday morning, according to a tweet released by the Atlanta Airport. The American Airlines flight, headed toward Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, had apparently not left the gate yet and passengers were forced to deplane.
