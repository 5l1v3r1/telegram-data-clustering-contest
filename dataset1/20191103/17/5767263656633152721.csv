20 Things That Only Needed One Added Detail to Become a Thousand Times Cooler

03 Nov 2019, 17:30

Today, scientists and designers invent hundreds of useful ideas that nobody would have even thought about just a few decades ago. But they also don’t forget about the ordinary things that, as it turns out, can be dramatically improved by adding just one small detail. This is how we now have hairdryers for shoes, umbrellas that collect the raindrops after they are folded, and even pedestrian crossings that don’t allow cars through.
We at Bright Side were amazed by how inventive these designers were and we want to show you the most unusual updates to things we already thought we knew.
