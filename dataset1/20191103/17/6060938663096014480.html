      <p>SAARBRUCKEN (Germany): India's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lakshya-Sen">Lakshya Sen</a> bagged his second successive <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/BWF-World-Tour-Super-100">BWF World Tour Super 100</a> title with a thrilling win over China's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Weng-Hong-Yang">Weng Hong Yang</a> in an exciting final at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/SaarLorLux-Open">SaarLorLux Open</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Lakshya, seeded eighth, needed 59 minutes to overcome Weng 17-21, 21-18, 21-16 in the summit clash for his third successive singles title of the season.</p>
      <p>He had clinched the Belgian International challenge and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dutch-Open-Super-Tour-100">Dutch Open Super Tour 100</a> in his last two outings. He had also reached the Polish Open final this year.</p>
      <p>World number 51 Sen, who has won the Asian Junior championship, a silver at the Youth Olympics and a bronze at World Junior Championship last year, continues to impress on the senior circuit.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old from Uttarakhand had come into the final with a 1-2 head-to-head record against the Chinese but it didn't matter as he rallied his way after squandering the first game to complete a thrilling win here.</p>
      <p>After this win, Lakshya is set to break into the top 50 when the BWF rankings are released on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Lakshya had a good start as he was leading 14-11 but he couldn't sustain the pressure on his opponent who turned the tables to win the opening game.</p>
      <p>Stung by the reversal, Lakshya jumped to a 8-4 lead in the second game. The Indian quickly moved to 13-6. Weng reduced it to 10-14 but Lakshya managed to stay ahead of his rival and take the match into the decider.</p>
      <p>In the third game, Lakshya fell behind 5-7 but managed to claw back at 10-10 before Weng moved to a 16-13 lead.</p>
      <p>A fighting Lakshya then stepped on the gas and reeled off the remaining eight points to leave his rival stranded.</p>
      <p>Lakshya is likely to participate in two International Challenge events, the Irish Open (November 13-16) and Scottish Open (Nov 21-24) -- before featuring in the Syed Modi International Super 300 (Nov 26-Dec 1).</p>
