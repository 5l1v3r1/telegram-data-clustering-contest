      <p>This week, he sparked concerns that an Ibrox exit could be on the cards in the near future, telling Colombian radio station Blu Radio: “So far there is nothing official.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of speculation of teams things I've read on Twitter and stuff, but there's been nothing concrete, but if there is then I will let you know.</p>
      <p>"I just need to continue doing things to the best of my ability and we will see now in the winter transfer window if there’s the chance to make a bigger move, to a much better and more competitive league.</p>
      <p>"It would be good for me to keep improving, both for my game and my statistics to keep doing things the best I can."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Gerrard has said in no uncertain terms that his star forward will be going nowhere once the window re-opens.</p>
      <p>Asked about his future, he told BT Sport: "I'm not confident... I'm sure. I'm 100 per cent sure he's not going anywhere."</p>
