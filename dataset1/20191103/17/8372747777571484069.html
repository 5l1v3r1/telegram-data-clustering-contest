      <p>State leaders tried to give voters an election security confidence boost. U-S Attorneys, FBI, and Florida election staff are stressing they are working together ahead of 2020. They say they are sharing information to prevent future compromises.</p>
      <p>This is after two Florida county elections offices got hacked in the 2016 election. Authorities warn foreign threats are only growing, and technology to undermine elections is constantly evolving. Florida's secretary of state says the effort to fight back will help the state keep the pace.</p>
      <p>"Those of us who stand here before you are committed to working together every day between now and 2020 to give you the most secure, efficient, and reliable election possible," Secretary of State Laurel Lee said.</p>
      <p>Beyond working with each other, they are relying on recently improved security measures, including more than 18 million dollars worth of upgrades and training since last year.</p>
