      <h1>UK weather forecast: 'Scandinavian chill' to grip Bonfire Night before snow hits</h1>
      <h2>Temperatures are set to plunge to -4C this week with frost, ice and snow expected and Britain possibly set for its coldest November since 2010, say weather forecasters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T17:54:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Britain could see its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">coldest</a> November since the 2010 Big Freeze with a 1,200-mile wide 'Scandinavian shiver' set to grip the country from Guy Fawkes Night.</p>
      <p>Overnight temperatures are set to plunge to -4C in parts of the country this week, there is a risk of frost and ice and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snow">snow</a> is expected over high ground from midweek.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> is predicting colder-than normal conditions lasting for at least a week, but the chilly snap could go on for much of the month.</p>
      <p>Britons who are heading to Bonfire Night festivities have been told to wrap up and keep warm as cold air from Scandinavia arrives on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Most will shiver through 6-8C daytime maximum temperatures from Wednesday, with nights falling from -2C on Tuesday night to -4C by the weekend in the north.</p>
      <p>Lows in the south will be just above the freezing mark.</p>
      <p>Midweek sees Scotland face snow on high ground and ice worries, with 50mph gusts in the South West.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain was falling in parts of Scotland on Sunday with flood alerts for Aberdeenshire and Dundee and Angus.</p>

      <p>In England, there were two flood warnings (for Bristol Avon from Chippenham to Melksham, and River Esk from Briggswath to Ruswarp) and 43 alerts following Saturday's torrential downpours.</p>
      <p>A flood warning was issued for the River Ritec at Tenby in Wales, in addition to four alerts as of Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>The weather is set to turn colder after Britain was battered by hurricane-force winds of 109mph and heavy rain that caused flooding on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Computer forecast models point to this November being the coldest since 2010, said The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">Weather</a> Outlook.</p>

      <p>A November average temperature under 4.9C, 1.3C below normal, would be the UK's coldest November since 2010, Met Office records show.</p>
      <p>Weather maps show all of the UK with temperatures between 1C and 3C below average over the next week, a forecast by the UK-based European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts said.</p>
      <p>The Big Freeze in 2010 began with -18C lows in Wales on November 28, followed by a month-long whiteout and travel mayhem with lows down to -19C in England and -21C in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “After a number of mild Novembers in recent years, computer models for the month ahead suggest this November is set to be the coldest since 2010.”</p>

      <p>Forecaster John Hammond, of weathertrending, said: “There are similarities between the current set-up and November 2010.”</p>
      <p>Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: “A much colder spell of weather arrives as cold air sinks down from Scandinavia and the Arctic from Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Wrap up warm for Bonfire Night and wear wellies. After recent rain, there's the risk of cancellations for events using parking on grass.</p>
      <p>“Tuesday night looks dry but frosty, with -2C lows in Scotland, with cold nights in the south as well later in the week and -4C possible</p>

      <p>“Daytime temperatures will struggle to 6-8C for many this week, with midweek showers cold enough for snow in Scotland and to lower levels on Shetland, with 50mph gusts forecast in the South West.</p>
      <p>“The pool of cold air stays with us and it looks like remaining on the cold side from the weekend onwards.”</p>
      <p>A Met Office forecaster said: “Temperatures may stay below average this week, bringing the risk of frost and ice.</p>
      <p>“November 17 to December 1 is more likely to be below-average at the start of the period, then become near-average towards the end of the month.”</p>
