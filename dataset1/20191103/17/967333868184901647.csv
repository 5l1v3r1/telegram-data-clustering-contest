Ukraine Whistleblower Must Come Forward, Trump Insists

03 Nov 2019, 17:52


The whistleblower's complaints about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president into launching a certain investigation essentially led to the ongoing impeachment inquiry against the US head of state.

Appealing to the whistleblower directly, which appears to be a deviation from the norms of conduct in such matters, Trump claimed that the person should reveal themselves because they ""got it so wrong.""
Voicing his grievances via Twitter, as usual, the US president also claimed that the ""Fake News Media"", which he also described as ""an arm of the Democrat Party"", is well aware of the whistleblowers identity but is reluctant to reveal it ""because there would be hell to pay.""
""Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!"" Trump demanded.



​The US president also declared that none of the ""many people"" who were listening to his call with the Ukrainian president seemed to have any complaints about it because it was ""totally appropriate"", and boasted that his ""Republican approval rating"" is now 95 percent.



​The impeachment inquiry against US President Donald Trump was launched on 24 September after a whistleblower complained that Trump allegedly attempted to pressure the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating potential corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, thus possibly gaining advantage for the upcoming 2020 US presidential election.
Trump released the transcript of the 25 July phone conversation to which the whistleblower was referring to, and declared that the impeachment inquiry is nothing but a ‘hoax’ aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 US presidential election.
