Jeg trodde tyvene her i byen var mer kresne

Jeg kjøper kun brukte sykler til et par tusen kroner. De blir stjålet uansett.
Den var meget godt brukt, kjedet var rustent etter en vinter på saltføre, men sykkelen gjorde nytten sin den. Helt til en tjuveradd fant ut at han skulle tjene noen raske kroner på min gamle DBS. Sykkelen sto innelåst i en privat parkeringskjeller i Sentrum, men jeg hadde selvfølgelig ikke låst den. Jeg trodde tyvene her i byen var mer kresne på tyvegodset. Der tok jeg grundig feil. Jeg var på grensen til å bli forbannet. Jeg var tross alt glad i den gamle ramma.

I only buy used bicycles for a couple of thousand dollars. They are stolen anyway.
It was very well used, the chain was rusty after a winter of salt, but the bike did its best. Until a thief riddle found out that he was earning some quick bucks on my old DBS. The bike was locked in a private parking garage in the city center, but of course I hadn't locked it. I thought the thieves here in town were more discerning about the thieves. There I was thoroughly wrong. I was on the verge of being cursed. After all, I loved the old frame.
