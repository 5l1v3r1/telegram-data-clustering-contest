      <h1>Microsoft Japan experiments with 3-day weekend, productivity increases by nearly 40 percent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T17:42:50+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">David Aaro</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/japan">Japan</a> is known for having some of the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health">longest working hours</a> in the world, with nearly a quarter of Japanese companies previously requiring employees to clock in more than 80 hours of overtime a month, according to a 2016 government survey. They were so long that Japan introduced a new law this year limiting legal overtime work to 45 hours a month, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/02/new-labour-law-puts-limits-japans-overworking-culture/">Telegraph reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Japan is working to break that trend, thanks to a bold new strategy it hopes will improve the work-life balance of its workers by implementing a three-day weekend for its employees.</p>
      <p>They found that when the company decreased hours of its workweek, productivity actually increased -- a surprising result considering Japan is one of the most overworked and least productive workforces among G-7 nations, according to a CNBC report that used data from OECD Compendium of Productivity Indicators.</p>

      <p>In August, the company carried out a "Working Reform Project," called the Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019. For one month in August, they gave their 2,300 employees every Friday off during the month, according to <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/">soranews24</a>.</p>

      <p>The results found that even without the additional day, productivity within the company increased by 39.9 percent.</p>
      <p>The study found a major factor in the productivity increase was a result of meeting changes. The four-day workweek forced employees to use their time more efficiently, so many of the meetings were either cut, shortened or changed to virtual meetings instead of in-person, according to the outlet.</p>

      <p>Employees also took 25.4 percent fewer days off during the month, printed 58.7 percent fewer pages and used 23.1 percent less electricity in the office, the study concluded.</p>
      <p>While this strategy won't work for every type of job, the majority of employees at Microsoft Japan were big supporters of the new initiative.</p>

      <p>The outlet said that 92.1 percent of employees said they liked the four-day workweek at the end of its trial run in August.</p>
      <p>Due to the success of the program, Microsoft says it plans on implementing it again next summer or at other dates in the future.</p>
