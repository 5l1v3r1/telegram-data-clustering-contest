      <h1>Barcelona's worst start in away games for 13 years</h1>
      <h2>The Catalans have only won twice and suffered three defeats in their start to the league season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T17:01:38+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">German Bona</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona are struggling away from home. At Camp Nou they have won five from five, but after 2-0 and 3-0 wins at Getafe and Eibar seemed to have got the situation under control, it's got bad again.</p>
      <p>The Catalans are leaders despite that, but there is a problem away from home. In the Champions League they drew with Dortmund and beat Slavia narrowly, in two more uncertain displays. Ter Stegen saved them away in Europe but in the league he's not been able to.</p>
      <p>Barca have the worst run of away results since the 2007-08 season with Frank Rijkaard. They have the aforementioned two wins, a draw (Osasuna) and three defeats (Athletic, Granada, Levante). Seven points from 18 and not even against any sides playing in Europe or fighting for the title.</p>
      <p>It's 13 years since Barca did that badly. That campaign with Rijkaard they took a point less - 6 - after curiously only winning away at Levante, 4-1, drawing with Racing and Osasuna 0-0 and 1-1 at Valladolid, and losing at Villarreal (3-1) and Getafe (2-0). Barca finished second that season.</p>
