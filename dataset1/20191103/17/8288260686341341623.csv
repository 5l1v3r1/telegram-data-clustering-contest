A man has been arrested on suspicion of grooming a child for sexual activity in Stourbridge.
The 50-year-old man, who has not been named, was detained by police after officers were called to Kingsway just before 8.15pm on Saturday, November 2.
A video, which Black Country Live is not broadcasting, appears to show a vigilante sting moments before the arrest took place.

The spokesman added: “Police have arrested a 50-year-old man on suspicion of grooming a child for sexual activity, after being called to Kingsway in the Wollaston area of Stourbridge just before 8.15pm last night (Saturday, November 2).
“He remains in police custody today (Sunday, November 3).""
