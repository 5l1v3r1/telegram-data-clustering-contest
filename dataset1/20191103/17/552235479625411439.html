      <h1>Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon could be filmed in Scotland</h1>
      <h2>Fantasy author George RR Martin sparked frenzy among GOT fans with his latest blog post.</h2>

      <p>A new Game of Thrones spin-off show could be filmed in Scotland. </p>
      <p>George RR Martin, who wrote the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> books, sparked frenzy among GOT fans in his latest blog post. </p>
      <p>House of the Dragon could use Scottish locations used in the original series, according to Martin. </p>
      <p>In the post, The Dragons Take Wing, Martin toys with the possibility of making a return to Scotland among other locations across Europe. </p>
      <p>He wrote: “Ryan Condal has already done a considerable amount of writing on House of Dragon, but a lot of work remains ahead of us. </p>
      <p>“As yet, we don’t even know where we will be shooting . . . though I expect we will revisit at least some of the countries David and Dan used for Game of Thrones (Ireland, Iceland, Scotland, Croatia, Morocco, Malta and Spain.”</p>

      <p>Initially when Game of Thrones crew started looking for locations, Scotland was on the list. </p>
      <p>Those who’ve watched the hit TV series since the beginning will remember one of Scotland’s most iconic castles from the very first episode. </p>
      <p>The 14th century <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/games-thrones-star-rory-mccann-3303810">Doune Castle</a> in Stirling was used to depict Winterfell in the pilot for the series. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately this didn’t last long and film crews left Scotland soon after. </p>
      <p>Doune Castle isn't the only Scottish connection to GOT.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year we told how two new limited edition Game of Thrones whiskies had been released.</p>
      <p>The Johnnie Walker team and HBO are introducing two collaborations inspired by the iconic and powerful houses of Westeros – House Stark and House Targaryen – which are the successors to the White Walker by Johnnie Walker limited edition blend launched in 2018.</p>
