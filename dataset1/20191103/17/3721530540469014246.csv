BlizzCon is a fan convention, after all, so it follows that heaping helpings of fan service are served up there. Here is one such plateful, a retrospective on the 25-year canon of Warcraft.
Fifteen years of that are driven by World of Warcraft, of course, and its factions’ principal characters combine for the trailer’s money line “You’ll never fight alone.” This is a massively multiplayer online game, after all.
So no matter who you’ve become attached to — and in 15 years’ time, it might be everyone, Jaina, Anduin, Sylvanas and Thrall are here to give a big thumbs up, in scenes referencing the pivotal events of Azeroth, going back to the RTS days.
World of Warcraft launched Nov. 23, 2004. World of Warcraft Classic, a vanilla presentation of the game’s early state, went live in the MMO in August. And World of Warcraft: Shadowlands was announced as the next major expansion — no launch date or window though — at BlizzCon 2019 this weekend.
