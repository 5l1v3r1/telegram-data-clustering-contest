The New Pope Trailer Leads Us Into Temptation
03 Nov 2019, 17:45 by Devon Ivie



Meet the new pope, same as the young pope? Definitely not. HBO has blessed us heathens with a new trailer for the sinful New Pope, which finds our papal boo, Lenny (Jude Law), ending his time as supreme pontiff thanks to falling into a coma. Coming out of the white chimney smoke as his replacement is a volatile chap (John Malkovich) who prefers straggly beards to Speedos, although it’s nice that the same Big Narcissist Energy will remain. “Everyone in the world should know who the pope is,” he coos to his staff. “It’s not vanity; it’s necessity.” Little is currently known about the nine-episode season, with showrunner Paolo Sorrentino only teasing that he’ll keep exploring “the world of the modern papacy.” Silvio Orlando’s conniving cardinal will return, with Sharon Stone and Marilyn Manson also joining in supporting roles. It’ll arrive on HBO in January 2020. Praise be!
