A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a young woman was found dead in a town centre.
Detectives say the 26-year-old victim lost consciousness following an altercation in Halifax, West Yorkshire, during the early hours of this morning.
The street where the incident took place was cordoned off for a painstaking forensic examination.
Bystanders sobbed in the street as 999 workers tried to revive the girl with heart massage and the kiss of life.
She was rushed to hospital intensive care but pronounced dead despite medic's desperate attempts to save her life.

One bystander had attempted to perform CPR on the critically-injured woman but was unable to save her her life, it later emerged.
A local shopkeeper said: “I just saw a lot of people there and somebody was trying to press on the chest of a girl because she couldn’t breathe.
“There more than 20, 25 people. I saw one girl crying. Maybe she was with her.”
