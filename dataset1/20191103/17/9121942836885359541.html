      <p>MIAMI (AP) — Duncan Robinson scored 23 points, Meyers Leonard added 21 and the Miami Heat led by 41 points on the way to a 129-100 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Butler scored 18 points and had nine assists for the Heat, and James Johnson had 17 points in his season debut. Miami is 5-1, matching the best six-game start in franchise history.</p>
      <p>James Harden scored 29 points for Houston, and Russell Westbrook was held to only 10. The Heat had 38 assists to Houston’s 19, in a game that was decided very early.</p>
      <p>It was a record-setting opening quarter for the Heat — resulting in the third-biggest lead after 12 minutes in the NBA’s shot-clock era, starting with the 1954-55 season. Miami led 46-14 after that first quarter. The only bigger leads after one quarter since the shot clock was put into play came when the Los Angeles Lakers led the Sacramento Kings 40-4 after one quarter on Feb. 4, 1987, and the Baltimore Bullets leading the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 45-12 after one quarter on Dec. 9, 1972.</p>
      <p>KINGS 113, KNICKS 92</p>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — De’Aaron Fox scored 24 points, Buddy Hield had 22 and Sacramento beat New York for its second straight victory following an 0-5 start.</p>
      <p>Harrison Barnes added 19 points, and Richaun Holmes had 14 points and 10 rebounds.</p>

      <p>Marcus Morris scored 28 points for New York. The Knicks have lost three straight to fall to 1-6.</p>
      <p>PACERS 108, BULLS 95</p>
      <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — T.J. Warren scored a season-high 26 points and Indiana beat Chicago.</p>
      <p>Malcolm Brogdon added 22 points and seven assists. Indiana was missing injured forward/center Myles Turner (ankle), center Domantas Sabonis (calf contusion) and All-Star guard Victor Oladipo (knee).</p>
      <p>Zach LaVine scored 21 points for Chicago. The Bulls are 0-5 on the road</p>
