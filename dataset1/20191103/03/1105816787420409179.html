      <h1>Trade talks in balance at Southeast Asian summit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T03:41:20+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 03:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>BANGKOK: </b>Plans to finalise an Asia-wide trade deal at a summit in Bangkok this weekend were uncertain after new demands raised by India in the negotiations to create the world’s largest trading bloc.</p>
      <p>Southeast Asian leaders meeting in Thailand hope to make progress on the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – which would comprise 16 countries that account for a third of global gross domestic product and nearly half the world’s population.</p>
      <p>Talks are expected to continue on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Bangkok after a press conference was cancelled on Friday, raising questions whether ministers could reach an agreement in their last formal negotiations ahead of a summit on the regional partnership on Monday.</p>

      <p>Host Thailand has been pushing for a preliminary deal by the end of the year, keen to push ahead at a time when US-China tensions threaten to slow growth in the region.</p>
      <p>A major sticking point has been demands from India, which is worried about a potential flood of Chinese imports. “It’s a fact India has put new demands which are difficult to meet,” said a person with knowledge about New Delhi’s negotiations.</p>
      <p>Any breakthrough on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would boost confidence in export-reliant Southeast Asia that has been weighed down by the US-China trade war, with growth expected to slow to its lowest in five years.</p>
