      <p>BOLOGNA, Italy: Romelu Lukaku scored twice in the last 15 minutes, the second a stoppage-time penalty, as Inter Milan dramatically came from behind to win 2-1 at Bologna in Serie A on Saturday (Nov 2) and keep up the pressure on Juventus.</p>
      <p>The Belgian settled the match with his ninth goal of the season after Lautaro Martinez went down under Riccardo Orsolini's challenge in the penalty area.</p>

      <p>Although the decision appeared clear cut, Bologna were furious at having their own penalty appeal turned down in a previous attack and the match ended amid angry protests from the home team and jeering from their fans.</p>
      <p>The win meant that Inter, who have 28 points from 11 games, would finish the weekend as Serie A leaders if Juventus, who were two points behind, failed to beat neighbours Torino later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"The team showed a great reaction. We conceded a goal that could have destroyed us but these lads demonstrated fantastic inner strength," said Inter coach Antonio Conte.</p>
      <p>"We’re working hard and the thing that is making me happy is working with a group of serious and willing lads. Today, those who came on also did really well, they all have a drive that allows them to never give up in adversity and this is the most important aspect."</p>
      <p>Inter had two goals disallowed in the first half, the first for offside against Martinez and the second because the ball went out of play before Valentino Lazaro - making his first start since his move from Hertha Berlin - pulled the ball back for Lukaku to turn into the net.</p>
      <p>Bologna had not beaten Inter at home since 2002, a run of 14 matches, but looked as if they could end that sequence when Roberto Soriano gave them shock lead with a deflected shot in the 59th minute.</p>
      <p>Lukaku missed a chance for a quick equaliser by failing to make proper contact with Lazaro's low cross but he made no mistake in the 75th minute, turning in the rebound after Lukasz Skorupski made a superb save from Milan Skriniar's shot.</p>
      <p>Bologna had a penalty waved away when Rodrigo Palacio went down under a challenge late in the game and, in Inter's next attack, Orsolini clumsily kicked Martinez's leg and gave away a penalty which Lukaku comfortably dispatched. </p>
