【蕭茗看世界】蓬佩奧、彭斯美中關係演講比較與分析

03 Nov 2019, 03:50

大家好，我是蕭茗。今天是2019年11月1日星期五。很對不起大家，我有兩個多星期沒有做節目了。主要是我在做一個深度報導，是關於中國公司在美國資本市場的規模，在這個背景下講中美經濟脫鉤的意義和難度。這是一個非常重要的問題，不亞於貿易戰。所以我花了很大精力做那個報導，自媒體就沒跟上。那個深度報導是一個系列，做完一期我也會把核心內容在自媒體 跟大家講講。最新一期這週就出來了。我會把鏈接放在置頂留言裡面。
相關視頻：



那今天我主要想談的是美國國務卿蓬佩奧剛剛在hudson institute 的一個演講，我想把他這個演講和美國副總統彭斯上週的演講做一個比較。我覺得這兩個演講的不同之處透露出了一些重要信息。我會把我最近在華府參加活動的經歷放在一起說一說。
首先說蓬佩奧的這個演講。他是在保守派智庫Hudson Institute做的。他不是專門爲做這個演講去Hudson的，而是hudson頒給他一個獎-Herman Kahn獎。他是在頒獎慶典上做這個演講的。Herman Kahn是什麽人呢？是Hundson Institute的創始人。他在1983年的時候已經去世了。他生前是美國關於冷戰的重要學者。冷戰中的重要思路，比如，對蘇聯的核威懾力的理論就是他提出的。在hudson初創的時候，他就指示要以非傳統方式，研究美國的未來。那這次蓬佩奧在演講中也多次提到非傳統這個詞。 尤其是他說，針對中國問題，美國必須用新的、非傳統方式處理。
所以蓬佩奧是去領獎的，按常理他發表的演說應該是一個獲獎感言，是吧？應該講講自己的理念，生活經歷，對世界的看法。但蓬佩奧沒有那樣做。他在這個發表獲獎感言的場合發表了一篇討共檄文。爲什麽會這樣呢？我認爲有兩個原因。一個是中國對他來說是一個非常重要的話題。另外一個，我認爲他是在彭斯發表了關於中國的演講之後，要發出一個和一週前彭斯不太一樣的聲音。一個對中共更強硬的聲音。而他這篇演講不是在國務院那么正式的場合做的，所以和彭斯比較的意味就更澹一些。我覺得這可能也是專門的考慮。
他的這篇演講，時間不太長，大概18分鍾。最核心的內容可以總結成一句話。「美國和全世界要正面對抗中共所有的挑戰」。這句話是整篇演講的核心論點。然後他講了爲什麽要這樣做。爲什麽要這樣做基本上就是羅列中共長期以來在國際舞台上，在中美關係上所做的那些不能被容忍的行爲，以及美國這麽多年對中共的誤判導致的對華政策錯誤，對美國的傷害。這些內容大家在過去美國鷹派政治人物的演講中都聽過，比如：美國如何錯誤的認爲只要讓中國經濟發展，民主自然會發生。美國企業如何爲了在華市場而屈從於中共，在任何中共認爲有爭議的問題上都和中共保持一致，從而發展出了一個中共在美國的永久說客集團。還有，中共媒體如何一貫歪曲美國的政策和意願等等。還有一個小小的地方。他在演講中提到習近平的時候說的是習總書記，而不是習總統。彭斯在上個星期演講的時候用的是習總統。蓬佩奧稱他習總書記，是要強調他共產黨黨魁的身分。這一點和彭斯也有區別。
蓬佩奧的演講中有好幾處對中共措辭非常嚴厲的地方。比如，他說「今天，我們終於認識到了中國共產黨對美國和美國價值仇視的程度，他們更糟糕的言行以及給美國帶來的影響。」
這是非常決絕的一句話，這不是說給既競爭又合作的夥伴說的，這是在把對方認定爲敵人之前說的定性的話。 而彭斯副總統在他的演講中是重提川普在2017年的國家安全戰略中說的，美國現在認定中國是美國的戰略和經濟對手。蓬佩奧的說法和彭斯的說法勉強可以說是在一個級別，但毫無疑問，蓬佩奧的用詞更堅定決絕。對共產黨的定義也更清晰。
我上面說了，這篇蓬佩奧演講的核心是「美國和西方世界要正面對抗中共的所有挑戰」。然後他講了爲什麽要這樣做，第二個重要的原因就是中共在全球的野心。說白了就是中共要改變整個二戰之後建立的以崇尚民主，人權和自由爲主體架構的國際秩序，要取代美國在世界上的領導位置。蓬佩奧在演講裡說：中國共產黨是一個馬克思-列寧主義政黨，核心目標是鬥爭和爭奪世界主導權。 他說：北京正在積極創造自己的國際空間，並參加國際組織以驗證其極權體系並擴大其影響範圍。 而我們在美國，包括哈德遜學院的的這些好人是希望維護美國幫助建立並繼續領導的現有自由和開放的國際秩序。
這就是中美兩國在全球層面對坑的核心。一個要改變現有的國際秩序，削弱另一方，並取代另一方的世界領導地位。另一方是要維持現有的國際秩序，不讓中共成爲世界霸主。
說到這裡，我想差開說一件我最近在華盛頓DC保守派智庫聯邦黨人社會舉辦的一個活動上的經歷。那個活動邀請美國商業部部長羅斯來發表關於中美貿易的演講。那是在中美剛剛宣布要達成第一階段的貿易協議之後。羅斯演講完了之後，有一圈討論。我問了在場的商業部助理部長Jeffery Kessler兩個問題。第一個問題是：我想知道川普政府是否真的相信中共會做那些結構性的改變，因爲這些改變對於中共來說，意味著要改變他們運作中國經濟的方式，運作國家的方式，統治的模式。這不是一個不可能的任務嗎？第二個問題是關於香港的。我下期節目再說。先說這個問題。助理部長回答的大意是說，他認爲中共可以對它的經濟作出結構性的改革，因爲他們以前也那麽做過。雖然最近幾年他們沒有進一步開放，但是還有可能回到從前的道路上。之後，美國國際貿易委員會的前主席也回答了這個問題。他說，美國從來沒有拒絕和極權國家，或者非市場經濟國家進行貿易往來。這和制定什麽樣的互惠的貿易規則是兩回事。我想他的意思是，美國可以和集權國家貿易，在這種情況下也可以制定互惠的貿易規則。
這就和上面我提到的蓬佩奧說中共的全球野心有關了。美國確實在和很多集權國家做生意呀，比如沙特阿拉伯就是美國在中東的盟友，美國從它那裡購買石油。但問題是，沙特沒有尋求改變國際秩序，沙特也沒有要在改變國際秩序的情況下削弱美國，取代美國在國際上的地位。還有，美國和沙特以及其他集權國家的貿易關係很簡單。經濟融合度遠沒有中美經濟大。所以在中美經貿關係中的很多問題都不會出現在美國和其他集權國家的貿易關係中。即便如此，美國公司自己制定的公司原則中很多都有要保護人權，不和有人權迫害記錄的公司和個人做生意的規定。
再回到助理商業部長的回答，他說中共會作出結構性改革，我覺得他沒有給出足夠的證據。首先，中共從來沒有對它的經濟體制作出根本性的改變。中國一直到現在也不能被稱爲真正的市場經濟。而這一點正是因爲它一直無法對政治體制進行改革。因爲真正的市場經濟，它不只是一個經濟制度。它的實現需要有一個堅實的政治制度做基礎。這個制度就是民主，法制，對人權的尊重。在民主制度之下，private sector，就是屬於個人的公司，企業，他們的權益才能獲得全面的保障，他們才能免受政府對他們的各種干預控制，他們才能在這個環境中蓬勃發展。對人權的尊重是民主制度的一部分，而根本上來講，這個理念有一個宗教信仰的淵源。 就是創世主創造了人，賦予人不可被剝奪的權利。就是天賦人權。它是這麼來的。 只有對人權尊重，才會尊重私有產權，尊重知識產權。只有在完善的法制之下，才能對知識產權進行強有力的保護。所以，一個繁榮的市場經濟的背後，是一個堅實的民主制度。中共只改經濟不改政治，註定經濟領域的改革也是半吊子改革，還在生出無窮無盡的問題。而現在在中國和美國的經濟高度融合，大量交往的狀況下，川普政府要求的中共做結構性改革實際上就是要動到中共管理中國的方式，要動到它的政治體制。
我爲什麽要說一大堆這個呢？因為很可能川普內閣中的很多人，包括我提問的助理商業部長，在應對中美貿易戰的時候，對中共的判斷上可能都缺失了這樣重要一個環節。就是結構性改革和中共的統治模式，和它命運的關係。這是一個很核心的認知，不一定一直要被掛在嘴上，但是觀察美國在貿易戰中的做法，就可以知道他們是否心中有這樣的認知。 而從彭斯副總統的這次演講中，我也沒有感覺到他對這個因果鏈條有特別清晰的認知。所以這就導致他在後面的演講中給人以立場不是特別清晰的印象。
他實際上把兩面的話都說了。一方面說美國要堅守自己的價值。另一方面說中共只要好好守規矩的做生意，中美之間就會有一個新的開始。
他具體是這麼鋪陳的。首先他用了大量篇幅講述了中共在各個領域不遵守國際規則，違反人權，破壞宗教自由，對周邊國家武力威脅，美國企業被它脅迫和收買，成為中共的說客。 最後說到，川普總統在為美國而戰，為美國人民，美國的工作機會而戰，絕不退縮。
然後，口風突然一轉，說了這樣一句話。他說：雖然如此，但川普總統非常清晰的表示他並不尋求和中國對抗。他尋求的是一個公平的競爭場地，開放的市場，公平的貿易和對美國價值的尊重。可能是覺得聽眾對此理解還不深，所以他又進一步解釋了一下。他說：美國不尋求壓制中國的發展。美國尋求和中共領導人的建設性關係，就像我們幾代人一直和中國人民保持的關係一樣。中國完全可以和美國開始一個新篇章，只要中共停止長期以來在貿易方面占美國便宜的行為就可以。川普總統就會願意和中國開始一個新的篇章，就像我們過去做的一樣。
所以，這個邏輯是不是這樣：美國要堅守自己的價值，中共做了很多壞事。但中共只要在經貿方面守規矩改好，美國就願意和中共開始一個新篇章。
這個邏輯深究下去，是有點讓人擔心的。只要經貿方面改好，就會有一個新開始。那別的方面都不管了嗎？人權，宗教自由都不管了嗎？ 從另外一個角度說呢，這也是一個自相矛盾的邏輯。如果美國在和中共的交往中只要求中共在經貿方面改好？美國怎麼可能堅守自己的價值呢？ 是吧？實際上，這個做法是行不通的。
當然，可能很多朋友會想到，你解讀的不對呀，美國在保護人權和信仰自由方面都有作為呀！ 比如最近把28家違反人權的企業和機構都列在實體名單上不就是美國堅持自己的價值，對中共懲罰的例子嗎？川普總統不是自己也說，如果中共不人道的對待香港，中美之間是很難達成貿易協議嗎？是這樣的。這兩件事，一個是蓬佩奧領導的國務院基於美國的價值觀，所做的一個符合美國國家利益和理念的舉措。川普總統也是基於美國的價值觀，還有多方反饋，作出了對香港那樣的表態。但是，從根本上，它並不能代表川普總統對中美貿易戰核心邏輯的理解。 而這個核心邏輯，就是我上面說的：中共沒有可能在不進行政治改革的情況下遵守國際秩序，做到美國要求的結構性的改革。
前者基於美國價值觀去做事，是比較鬆散的，可多做也可少做的。而後者是一場戰爭中對對手的核心判斷。這個判斷時刻都不能離開對戰爭每一環節的部署。有了這個核心判斷，再加上堅守美國的價值觀，這才是完整的對抗中共的戰略。
而對於這個核心判斷，川普總統從來沒有這麼表述過。他內心怎麼想，我不知道。我的判斷是，他可能不是特別清晰，或者他有些迴避，不願意從這個角度去想這個問題。因為就像我上次說的，川普總統是想通過一場貿易戰來糾正中美之間不平等的經貿關係。他的初始目標並不是要中共進行政治改革，更不是推翻中共。所以，一場為經濟利益而打的貿易戰，最後成敗的關鍵卻落在了讓中共做政治改革，甚至讓它不存在。這個認知上的轉變，對於川普總統來說是需要一個時間和過程的。
如果川普將來真的意識到中共不會做結構性改革的話，我認為他會得出一個結論，就是中美經濟必須要脫鉤。 大家想想這是不是唯一的道路？ 因為美國不可能再維持這個不公平的經貿關係，中共又不會做關鍵的改變。那還能怎麼辦？剩下的路只能是脫鉤。（視頻中， 大家想想……）
那麼，我把一切都繫於這一點，就是中共無法做結構性改革，基於這個做所有的沙盤推演，這一點又有多實在呢？ 中共萬一能做結構性改革呢？我確實不能100%的保證未來將發生什麼事情。我們只能根據歷史，使用理性進行分析。我現在看到的是，越來越多的人，包括中共內部的人都在說，結構性改革將是中共最難以接受的條件。
說到這裡，我還想提一句，我最先提到美國要求中共進行結構性改革，不太可能的時候，大概是一年以前了，那時候我還沒有聽到別人在說這個事情。但是後來，我看到美國鷹派的言論中越來越顯示了他們對這個問題的認知，也是基於此，他們贊成中美經濟要脫鉤。現在，我們看到中國那邊也明確表示了結構性改革是最大的障礙。我最近看的一片彭博社的文章引述一位前中國商業部官員周小明的話。他說：如果美國要求的太多，例如堅持要讓中國做所謂的結構性的改革，這些改革要改變中國的經濟模式，那在川普的第一任是不可能達成完整協議的。如果美國不堅持的話，中國倒是願意儘快達成協議。另外，一個完整的協議中是不可以給中方施加任何懲罰性關稅的。
所以中共那邊有兩條底線。一個是中共內部的意識形態壓力不允許習近平接受一個所謂屈辱的協議，也就是說，如果懲罰性關稅還在，習近平就不敢簽完整的協議。實際上第一階段的協議現在也開始有些不確定了，就是因為這個原因。第二，結構性改革不能接受。我認為中共只有到萬不得已的時候，經濟危機已經嚴重威脅到統治安全的時候，才會表面上接受結構性改革，但是實質上還會想盡辦法不執行。所以，川普那邊就一直要把關稅這把劍懸在中共頭上。執行的不好，關稅就一直不取消。那中共那邊又認為這成了一個喪權辱國的條約，絕對不能接受。所以，貿易談判最終很可能就會陷入死胡同。
所以，川普越早認識到中共不可能做結構性的改革，就越早會走向兩國經濟脫鉤的道路。實際上，貿易談判陷入死胡同，表面上是中共在承受更大的壓力，但其實，這裡面還有一個很大的變量，就是美國金融界一直在給中共輸血。就是我最近做的中國公司在美國資本市場的規模的深度報導。如果這些輸血繼續進行，那麼，中國經濟就依然受到美國的支持，更嚴重的是，中國公司的盈虧就關係到了美國人自己未來的經濟安全。那時候，中美經濟就沒法脫鉤了。川普要對中國經濟進行的任何懲罰，例如關稅，也會在國內受到更大阻力。那些限制美國基金投資中國的法案，就可能很難通過。所以，中共只要能拖下去，讓中美經濟在金融領域進一步融合，那最終贏的就是中共。
所以，川普總統意識到中共不會做結構性改革，儘早走上中美經濟脫鉤的道路，這是整盤棋中的關鍵一步。
但這次彭斯演講中說，川普不是讓中美脫鉤，他想讓中美經貿關係重組後，兩國重新融合。川普總統現在還認為北京希望和美國達成貿易協議。
也就是說，川普總統還抱有希望。希望幾乎在任何情況下都是一個正能量詞。但是這次，川普總統的希望可能承載了巨大的代價。
說到這裡，我再最後說一下蓬佩奧的演講。蓬佩奧國務卿的這次演講和彭斯副總統的上次演講比較相似，和彭斯的這次演講相比，少了那些立場不太堅定的部分。雖然他也提到川普總統和中共達成第一階段協議表明美中兩國還是可以找到共同點，有機會合作。但是這部分一筆帶過，感覺上像是說的場面話。他這篇演講的核心意思，就是美國要非常清晰和把中共當成敵對對手，全面對抗。不僅是美國，還要聯合全世界。他雖然沒有直接提到我上面說的那個對貿易戰的核心認識。但是，他如果有這樣的認識我也不會驚訝的。
另一方面，我覺得川普總統在維護美國利益方面是不含煳的。這次擊斃ISIS的頭就是一個例子。川普總統不讓美國深陷中東戰爭，但是要保存美國在中東的必要利益，在這個前提下，能痛擊敵人的時候絕不手軟。所以，只要川普總統想清楚了，並且接受了中美貿易戰裡面的這個核心邏輯，那剩下的事情就比較好辦了。
好，今天說的太長了。就先到這裡。如果您喜歡我的節目，請訂閱和傳播我的頻道，並且別忘了按訂閱旁邊的小鈴鐺。感謝您的收看，我們下次再見。

[Xiao Wei sees the world] Comparison and analysis of the speeches of Pompeo and Peng Simei

03 Nov 2019, 03:50

Hello everyone, I am Xiao Yu. Today is Friday, November 1, 2019. I am sorry everyone, I have not finished the show for more than two weeks. Mainly I am doing an in-depth report about the scale of Chinese companies in the US capital market. In this context, the significance and difficulty of the decoupling of the Sino-US economy. This is a very important issue, no less than a trade war. So I spent a lot of energy doing the report, and I haven’t kept up with the media. The in-depth report is a series. After finishing the first issue, I will also talk about the core content in the media. The latest issue came out this week. I will put the link in the top message.
Related videos:



What I mainly want to talk about today is that US Secretary of State Pompeo has just given a speech at the hudson institute. I want to compare his speech with the speech of US Vice President Pence last week. I think the difference between the two speeches reveals some important information. I will talk about my recent experience in Washington.
First of all, I said this speech by Pompeo. He did it at the conservative think tank Hudson Institute. He did not specifically go to Hudson for this speech, but hudson awarded him a prize - the Herman Kahn Award. He made this speech at the awards ceremony. Who is Herman Kahn? Is the founder of the Hundson Institute. He died in 1983. He was an important scholar of the United States on the Cold War during his lifetime. The important ideas in the Cold War, for example, the theory of nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union was what he proposed. When Hudson was first created, he instructed to study the future of the United States in an unconventional way. That time, Pompeo also mentioned the word non-tradition many times in his speech. In particular, he said that the United States must deal with the Chinese issue in a new, non-traditional way.
So Pompeo is going to receive the award. According to common sense, his speech should be an award-winning testimonial, right? You should talk about your own ideas, life experiences, and views on the world. But Pompeo did not do that. He published a discussion on the occasion of the award-winning speech. Why is this so? I think there are two reasons. One is that China is a very important topic for him. The other one, I think, after he delivered a speech about China in Burns, he wanted to make a voice that was not quite the same as Pengs a week ago. A tougher voice against the CCP. And this speech was not made in the formal occasion of the State Council, so the meaning of comparison with Burns is even more awkward. I think this may also be a special consideration.
His speech is not too long, about 18 minutes. The core content can be summarized into one sentence. ""The United States and the world must face all the challenges of the CCP."" This sentence is the core argument of the whole speech. Then he told why he was doing this. Why is it basically to list the unacceptable behaviors that the CCP has done on the international stage in the Sino-US relationship for a long time, and the mistakes made by the United States over the years in the misjudgment of the Chinese Communist Party and the harm to the United States? . These contents have been heard in the speeches of American hawkish politicians in the past. For example, how the United States mistakenly believes that as long as China's economy develops, democracy will naturally happen. How American companies succumb to the CCP in order to compete in the Chinese market, and consistent with the CCP on any issues that the CCP believes to be controversial, thus developing a permanent lobby group of the CCP in the United States. Also, how the Chinese media has consistently misrepresented US policies and wishes. There is also a small place. In his speech, he mentioned Xi Jinping when he was talking about General Secretary Xi, not the president. In the last week, Burns used President Xi. Pompeo called his general secretary to emphasize the identity of his Communist Party leader. This is also different from Burns.
In Pompeo's speech, there are several places where the CCP's wording is very strict. For example, he said, ""Today, we finally realized the extent of the Chinese Communist Party’s hatred of the United States and the United States, their worse words and deeds and the impact on the United States.""
This is a very decisive sentence. This is not to say to a partner who is both competitive and cooperative. This is a qualitative statement before the opponent is identified as an enemy. In his speech, Vice President Burns reiterated Trump’s national security strategy in 2017. The United States now recognizes China as a strategic and economic opponent of the United States. Pompeo’s statement and Burns’s remarks can be said to be at one level, but there is no doubt that Pompeo’s words are more determined and determined. The definition of the Communist Party is also clearer.
As I said above, the core of this Pompey speech is ""The United States and the Western world must face all the challenges of the CCP."" Then he talked about why he should do this. The second important reason is the CCP’s global ambitions. To put it bluntly, the CCP wants to change the international order established after the Second World War to advocate democracy, human rights and freedom as the main body, and to replace the United States' leadership position in the world. In his speech, Pompeo said: The Communist Party of China is a Marxist-Leninist political party whose core goal is struggle and competition for world dominance. He said: Beijing is actively creating its own international space and participating in international organizations to verify its totalitarian system and expand its influence. And these good people in the United States, including Hudson College, want to maintain the existing free and open international order that the United States helps to build and continue to lead.
This is the core of China and the United States facing the pit at the global level. One wants to change the existing international order, weaken the other side, and replace the other party's world leadership. The other side is to maintain the existing international order and not let the CCP become the world hegemon.
Having said that, I would like to say a piece about my recent experience at an event organized by the Washington DC Conservative Think Tank Federal Party Society. The event invited US Secretary of Commerce Ross to give a speech on Sino-US trade. That was after China and the United States just announced that they would reach the first phase of the trade agreement. After Ross’s speech was over, there was a circle of discussion. I asked two questions from the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Jeffery Kessler. The first question is: I want to know if the Trump administration really believes that the CCP will do those structural changes, because these changes mean to the CCP to change the way they operate the Chinese economy, the way they operate the country, and the rule. Mode. Isn't this an impossible task? The second question is about Hong Kong. I will talk about the next show. Let me talk about this first. The assistant secretary replied that he believed that the CCP could make structural reforms to its economy because they had done so before. Although they have not been further opened in recent years, it is still possible to return to the road ahead. Later, the former chairman of the US International Trade Commission also answered this question. He said that the United States has never refused to trade with totalitarian countries or non-market economy countries. This is two different things from what kind of reciprocal trade rules are formulated. I think what he means is that the United States can trade with a centralized state, and in this case, it can also formulate reciprocal trade rules.
This is related to the global ambition of the CCP that Pompeo mentioned above. The United States is indeed doing business with many authoritarian countries. For example, Saudi Arabia is the United States’ ally in the Middle East, and the United States buys oil from it. But the problem is that Saudi Arabia has not sought to change the international order. Saudi Arabia has not yet weakened the United States in the face of changing the international order and replaced the United States in its international status. Also, the trade relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia and other authoritarian countries is simple. The degree of economic integration is far from the economic growth of China and the United States. Therefore, many problems in Sino-US economic and trade relations will not appear in the trade relations between the United States and other authoritarian countries. Even so, many of the company's own corporate principles have provisions to protect human rights and not to do business with companies and individuals with human rights persecution records.
Returning to the answer of the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, he said that the CCP will make structural reforms, and I think he did not give enough evidence. First of all, the CCP has never made a fundamental change in its economic system. China has not been called a real market economy until now. And this is precisely because it has been unable to reform the political system. Because of the real market economy, it is not just an economic system. Its realization needs to have a solid political system as the basis. This system is democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. Under the democratic system, private sector, that is, individual companies, enterprises, their rights and interests can be fully protected, they can not be controlled by the government's various interventions, they can flourish in this environment. Respect for human rights is part of a democratic system, and fundamentally, this concept has a source of religious belief. It is the Creator who created the people and gave them the right not to be deprived. It is a natural human right. It is like this. Only respect for human rights will respect private property rights and respect intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights can be strongly protected only under a sound legal system. Therefore, behind a prosperous market economy is a solid democratic system. The CCP only changed its economy and did not change its politics. It is doomed that reforms in the economic field are also half-sluggish reforms, and there are still endless problems. Now, with China and the United States highly integrated and a large number of exchanges, the CCP’s structural reforms required by the Trump administration are actually moving to the CCP’s way of managing China and moving its political system.
Why do I have to say a lot of this? Because it is very likely that many people in the Trump cabinet, including the assistant business minister who asked me, in the response to the Sino-US trade war, there may be such an important link missing from the CCP’s judgment. It is the relationship between structural reform and the ruling mode of the CCP and its destiny. This is a very core cognition. It doesn't always have to be hung up. But if you look at the US practices in the trade war, you can know if they have such perceptions. From the speech of Vice President Burns, I did not feel that he had a particularly clear understanding of this causal chain. So this led him to give a particularly unclear impression in his later speech.
He actually said everything on both sides. On the one hand, the United States must adhere to its own values. On the other hand, as long as the CCP is doing business in a good manner, there will be a new beginning between China and the United States.
He is so concrete. First of all, he used a lot of space to tell the CCP's failure to abide by international rules in various fields, violate human rights, undermine religious freedom, threaten the armed forces of neighboring countries, and American companies are coerced and bought by it, becoming a lobbyist of the CCP. Finally, President Trump is fighting for the United States, fighting for the American people and the United States, and never shrinking.
Then, the tone suddenly turned and said such a sentence. He said: Nevertheless, President Trump stated very clearly that he did not seek to confront China. What he seeks is a fair playing field, an open market, fair trade and respect for American values. It may be that the audience did not understand this deeply, so he explained it further. He said: The United States does not seek to suppress China's development. The United States seeks constructive relations with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, just as our generations have always maintained relations with the Chinese people. China can start a new chapter with the United States, as long as the CCP stops its long-standing trade-related behavior in the United States. President Trump will be willing to start a new chapter with China, just as we have done in the past.
Therefore, this logic is not the case: the United States must adhere to its own values, and the CCP has done a lot of bad things. However, as long as the CCP changes its rules and regulations in economic and trade relations, the United States is willing to start a new chapter with the CCP.
This logic goes deeper and is a bit worrying. As long as the economic and trade aspects are improved, there will be a new beginning. Doesn't that matter? Does human rights and religious freedoms matter? From another perspective, this is also a contradictory logic. If the United States only wants the CCP to improve its economic and trade aspects in its dealings with the CCP? How can the United States stick to its own value? right? In fact, this approach does not work.
Of course, many friends may think that your interpretation is wrong. The United States has a role in protecting human rights and freedom of belief! For example, the recent listing of 28 companies and institutions that violate human rights on the list of entities is not an example of the United States insisting on its own value and punishment for the CCP. President Trump did not himself say that if the CCP does not treat Hong Kong inhumanely, is it difficult to reach a trade agreement between China and the United States? Is such that. One of these two things, one is the State Department led by Pompeo, based on American values, and made an initiative that is in line with US national interests and ideas. President Trump is also based on American values, and there are many feedbacks that have made such a statement to Hong Kong. However, fundamentally, it does not represent President Trump’s understanding of the core logic of Sino-US trade war. And this core logic is what I said above: It is impossible for the CCP to abide by the international order without political reform and to achieve the structural reforms that the United States requires.
The former is based on American values and is relatively loose. It can be done more or less. The latter is the core judgment of the opponent in a war. This judgment moment cannot leave the deployment of every aspect of the war. With this core judgment, coupled with adhering to the values of the United States, this is a complete strategy against the CCP.
For this core judgment, President Trump has never said so. What does he think inside, I don't know. My judgment is that he may not be particularly clear, or he may be somewhat evasive and unwilling to think about it from this perspective. Because, as I said last time, President Trump wants to correct the unequal economic and trade relations between China and the United States through a trade war. His initial goal was not to politicize the CCP, nor to overthrow the CCP. Therefore, a trade war for economic interests, the key to success or failure in the final stage is to let the CCP do political reform, and even let it not exist. This cognitive shift requires a time and process for President Trump.
If Trump really realizes that the CCP will not make structural reforms in the future, I think he will come to the conclusion that the Chinese and American economies must be decoupled. Think about this is the only way? Because the United States cannot maintain this unfair economic and trade relationship, the CCP will not make key changes. What else can I do? The rest of the road can only be decoupled. (In the video, everyone thinks...)
Well, I have tied everything to this point, that is, the CCP can't do structural reforms, and based on this, all the sandboxes are deduced. How realistic is this? Can the CCP do structural reforms in case? I really can't guarantee 100% what will happen in the future. We can only use rationality for analysis based on history. What I am seeing now is that more and more people, including those within the CCP, are saying that structural reforms will be the most unacceptable conditions for the CCP.
Having said that, I would like to mention that I first mentioned that the United States asked the CCP to carry out structural reforms. When it was unlikely, it was probably a year ago. At that time, I had not heard anyone else saying this. But later, I saw that the American hawks’ speeches have increasingly shown their understanding of this issue. It is also based on this. They agree that the Chinese and American economies should be decoupled. Now, we have seen that China has also clearly stated that structural reform is the biggest obstacle. A recent Bloomberg article I quoted quoted Zhou Xiaoming, a former Chinese business ministry official. He said: If the United States asks too much, for example, insisting that China do so-called structural reforms that will change China's economic model, it is impossible to reach a complete agreement in Trump's first term. If the United States does not insist, China is willing to reach an agreement as soon as possible. In addition, a complete agreement cannot impose any punitive tariffs on the Chinese side.
So there are two bottom lines in the CCP. One is that the ideology pressure within the CCP does not allow Xi Jinping to accept a so-called humiliating agreement, that is, if punitive tariffs are still there, Xi Jinping will not dare to sign a complete agreement. In fact, the agreement of the first phase is now somewhat uncertain, for this reason. Second, structural reforms are unacceptable. I think that the CCP will only accept structural reforms when it is absolutely necessary, when the economic crisis has seriously threatened the security of the rule, but in essence, it will try its best not to implement it. Therefore, Trump has always wanted to hang the sword of tariffs on the head of the CCP. If the implementation is not good, the tariff will not be cancelled. The CCP also believed that this became a treaty to humiliate and humiliate the country, and it was absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, trade negotiations will eventually fall into a dead end.
Therefore, the sooner Trump realized that the CCP could not make structural reforms, the sooner it would lead to the decoupling of the two economies. In fact, trade negotiations are in a dead end. On the surface, the CCP is under more pressure. But in fact, there is a big variable in it, that is, the US financial community has been giving blood to the CCP. This is the in-depth report of the scale of Chinese companies in the US capital market. If these blood transfusions continue, then the Chinese economy will still be supported by the United States. What is more serious is that the profits and losses of Chinese companies are related to the economic security of the Americans themselves. At that time, the Chinese and American economies could not be decoupled. Any punishment that Trump wants to impose on the Chinese economy, such as tariffs, will also be more resistant at home. Those bills that restrict US funds from investing in China may be difficult to pass. Therefore, as long as the CCP can drag on and let the Chinese and American economies further integrate in the financial field, the CCP will eventually win.
Therefore, President Trump realized that the CCP will not make structural reforms and embark on the road of decoupling the Sino-US economy as soon as possible. This is a key step in the whole game.
But this time, Peng Si said that Trump is not decoupling between China and the United States. He wants to re-integrate the two countries after the reorganization of Sino-US economic and trade relations. President Trump also now believes that Beijing hopes to reach a trade agreement with the United States.
In other words, President Trump still has hope. Hope is a positive energy word in almost any situation. But this time, President Trump’s hopes may carry a huge price.
Having said that, I will finally talk about Pompeo’s speech. The speech by Secretary of State Pompeo is similar to that of Vice President Penns's last speech. Compared with this speech by Burns, there are fewer parts that are less determined. Although he also mentioned that President Trump and the Chinese Communist Party reached the first phase of the agreement, the United States and China can still find common ground and have the opportunity to cooperate. However, this part has been taken over and it feels like a scene. The core meaning of his speech is that the United States should be very clear and regard the CCP as a hostile opponent and a full-scale confrontation. Not only the United States, but also the world. Although he did not directly mention the core understanding of the trade war I said above. However, if he has such an understanding, I will not be surprised.
On the other hand, I feel that President Trump is not flawed in safeguarding the interests of the United States. This shot is the first example of killing the head of ISIS. President Trump will not let the United States fall into the Middle East war, but it must preserve the necessary interests of the United States in the Middle East. Under this premise, it will not be soft when it can attack the enemy. Therefore, as long as President Trump wants to be clear and accepts this core logic in the Sino-US trade war, the rest of the matter is easier to handle.
