週五，清華紫光集團（Tsinghua Unigroup）規模7.5億美元的2023年到期美元債券，價格一度跌到75.5美分的歷史新低。
而北大方正集團（Founder Group）2022年到期美元債券，價格更跌到了63.2美分。
方正集團美元債券此前連續下跌了數個月，價格從1美元左右下跌了超過30%。紫光美元債券則從一週前開始價格連續下跌，最大累積幅度超過15%。
澳盛銀行（Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.）信用策略主管賈里摩爾（Owen Gallimore）表示，紫光和方正可能會成為下一波美元債違約的中共國有企業，而中共企業複雜的產權結構，很難讓投資人安心。

紫光集團受中共官方大力扶植進軍半導體產業，方正集團的業務則涉及網絡、醫藥等行業。目前，兩集團的有息負債已經分別達到1,500億和2,000億人民幣。之前傳出消息，紫光集團尋求將部分債務的償還日期推遲54個月。
