      <p>LONDON:Â Liverpool staged a thrilling fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 thanks to Sadio Mane's last-gasp winner, while Manchester City kept in touch with the Premier League leaders after their own escape act in a 2-1 victory against Southampton on Saturday (Nov 2).</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side trailed to Trezeguet's first-half goal at Villa Park, but hit back to preserve their unbeaten league record this season in dramatic fashion.</p>

      <p>Andy Robertson equalised with four minutes left before Senegal winger Mane's stoppage-time goal gave Liverpool their 10th win from 11 league games.</p>
      <p>The Reds, chasing their first English title since 1990, are six points ahead of second-placed City.</p>
      <p>"It is the best possible feeling. It really is very satisfying, and the winner was from a corner kick routine that we have tried a few times," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"It was not because we have had a couple of comebacks in other games, you just have to keep on trying because we could have had another one today."</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's champions fell behind to James Ward-Prowse's early goal at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>But Sergio Aguero levelled for City with 20 minutes left and Kyle Walker snatched the winner in the 86th minute to keep Liverpool in their sights.</p>
      <p>"In the first season we won the title, we got 100 points and won four or five games in the last minute; last season we won more comfortably. Okay, this is like the first year," Guardiola said.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Chelsea climbed to third place as Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic sealed a 2-1 win at Watford.</p>
      <p>Manchester United slumped to a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth and Arsenal were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by Wolves, but all the focus was on the drama at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>At Villa Park, the hosts took a shock lead in the 21st minute when Egypt midfielder Trezeguet met John McGinn's free-kick and fired through the legs of Liverpool keeper Alisson.</p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino thought he had equalised for Liverpool, but the Brazilian was flagged for offside from Mane's cross.</p>
      <p>The goal was ruled out by VAR, with the Premier League offering a bizarre explanation that said Firmino's "armpit" was offside.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's equaliser finally arrived in the 86th minute when Mane's driven ball was met by Robertson and the full-back headed in at the far post.</p>
      <p>Then in the fourth minute of stoppage-time, Mane glanced in from Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner to complete Liverpool's incredible revival.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CITY ESCAPE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Struggling Southampton took the lead in the 13th minute when City keeper Ederson spilled Stuart Armstrong's shot and Ward-Prowse was on hand to slot home from close range.</p>
      <p>Aguero struck in the 70th minute when the club's record goalscorer converted Walker's low cross.</p>
      <p>With the momentum finally on their side, City won it in the 86th minute as Walker pounced after goalkeeper Alex McCarthy failed to deal with Angelino's cross.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted Manchester United had taken a "step back" after their mini-revival came to a crashing halt as Josh King's strike gave Bournemouth the points at Dean Court.</p>
      <p>Three consecutive wins on the road at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea had hinted at a turning point for United.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer said: "We have to win games like this. We were missing some quality at times. It is a step back for us today."</p>
      <p>Unai Emery's problems mounted as Raul Jimenez gave Wolves a 1-1 draw as fifth-placed Arsenal surrendered the lead for the third time in a week.</p>
      <p>The Gunners appeared to have put the issues surrounding Granit Xhaka to one side, the midfielder watching from home after swearing at supporters last week, when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck in the 21st minute.</p>
      <p>But Emery has now overseen a run of two wins from the last nine league games after Jimenez rose to header in an equaliser with 14 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>At Vicarage Road, Chelsea's fifth successive league win was earned thanks to Abraham's fifth minute strike and Pulisic's 55th minute tap-in.</p>
      <p>Gerard Deulofeu's 80th minute penalty came too late to stop Chelsea recording their seventh consecutive away victory in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Newcastle won 3-2 at West Ham, Sheffield United eased past Burnley 3-0 and Brighton beat Norwich 2-0.</p>
