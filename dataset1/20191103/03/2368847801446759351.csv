特斯拉第三代太陽能屋頂即將投產 更容易安裝

03 Nov 2019, 03:11

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】特斯拉（Tesla）近日宣布，將推出第三代太陽能屋頂（Solar Roof）——「太陽能玻璃」（Solarglass）。這種太陽能玻璃據稱可以大規模生產，價格會大幅降低。特斯拉希望以太陽能發電、電池儲能系統Powerwall和電動車組成完美的太陽能電力循環系統，滿足家庭綠能全電化的需求。
CEO馬斯克（Elon Musk）在一個電話會議上稱，他認為這將是應該大規模推出的首個版本，將於未來幾週內開始大面積安裝，希望每週能夠安裝1,000個。
特斯拉在2016年以26億美元購併太陽能供應商SolarCity後，在同年10月底推出四種不同樣式的第一代太陽能屋頂。特斯拉太陽能瓦片可直接當作屋瓦，屋頂一體成形，對整體美觀不會產生任何影響。只不過目前只有紋理與平滑型瓦片上市，且價格奇高。
與一二代相比，第三代太陽能屋瓦更容易安裝。馬斯克希望能進一步加速裝設速度，最終超越傳統屋瓦。
特斯拉的太陽能屋頂官網現在包括一個定價估算器，其中列出42,500美元作為2,000平方英尺屋頂瓦，外加10kW太陽能電池板的平均總價，而減去8,550的稅收優惠後，實價僅為33,950美元。
特斯拉表示，新一代太陽能屋瓦的單體發電效率雖然不如傳統的太陽能板，但太陽能屋瓦裝設面積較廣，因此整體發電量更高。除此之外，由於太陽能屋瓦是由強化玻璃製成，耐用性是一般瓦片的三倍以上，保固期是25年左右，包括其抗暴風（130 英里/小時）的能力與發電能力。

Tesla's third-generation solar roof is about to go into production easier to install

03 Nov 2019, 03:11

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing, November 03, 2019] Tesla recently announced that it will launch the third-generation Solar Roof, Solarglass. This type of solar glass is said to be mass-produced and the price will be greatly reduced. Tesla hopes to use solar power, battery energy storage system Powerwall and electric vehicles to form a perfect solar power circulation system to meet the needs of household green energy.
CEO Elon Musk said in a conference call that he thinks this will be the first version that should be launched on a large scale and will start a large-scale installation in the next few weeks, hoping to install 1,000 per week.
After purchasing solar energy supplier SolarCity for US$2.6 billion in 2016, Tesla launched the first generation of solar roofs in four different styles at the end of October of the same year. Tesla solar tiles can be used directly as roof tiles, and the roof is integrally formed without any impact on overall aesthetics. Only the texture and smooth tiles are currently available, and the price is very high.
Compared with the first and second generations, the third generation of solar roof tiles is easier to install. Musk hopes to further accelerate the installation speed and eventually surpass the traditional roof tiles.
Tesla's solar roof official website now includes a pricing estimator that lists $42,500 as a 2,000-square-foot roof tile, plus an average total price of 10kW solar panels, and after subtracting 8,550 tax credits, the net price is only 33,950. Dollar.
Tesla said that although the power generation efficiency of the new generation of solar roof tiles is not as good as that of traditional solar panels, the solar roof tiles are installed in a wider area, so the overall power generation is higher. In addition, since the solar roof tile is made of tempered glass, the durability is more than three times that of the general tile, and the warranty period is about 25 years, including its ability to withstand storms (130 mph) and power generation capacity.
