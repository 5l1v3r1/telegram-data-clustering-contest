03 Nov 2019, 03:20 by Lo


我們想讓你知道的是外籍男子2日下午闖入桃園機場管制區，爬上準備起飛的華航班機起落架疑企圖偷渡，遭人發現阻止，航班也因此延誤約3小時，這是桃機史上頭一遭。航警調查發現，男子身上沒有證件及入出境資料，國籍身分待查。



（中央社）桃園國際機場昨（2）日發生一名外籍男子闖入管制區，並爬上準備起飛的華航班機起落架案件。由於男子被警方逮捕後不願開口配合調查，因此航警昨晚將他留置在拘留所。
這名外籍男子2日下午闖入桃園機場管制區，爬上準備起飛的華航班機起落架疑企圖偷渡，遭人發現阻止，航班也因此延誤約3小時，這是桃機史上頭一遭。航警調查發現，男子身上沒有證件及入出境資料，國籍身分待查。
警方表示，由於男子已入侵管制區，警方當務之急要查明究竟如何進入，因為此舉已涉及航空保安法；另外，這名外籍男子也與航空器有接觸，恐怕也涉及影響飛航安全。
此外，男子如何進入台灣，這牽涉到入出境的問題，是否偷渡也需要查證；若非法入境，恐已違反入出國及移民法第74條，未經許可入國或受禁止出國處分而出國者，處3年以下有期徒刑、拘役或科或併科新台幣9萬元以下罰金。警方目前朝這些方向調查釐清。
警方表示，由於男子晚間偵訊還是不願開口，因此先將他留置在桃園機場航警局拘留所，希望經一夜的時間讓他心情平復並設法誘導他開口接受偵訊，以獲得有用的線索，便於進行案情調查。
另外，警方也希望能透過指紋、虹膜等方式來辨識男子身分，同時也從男子行李中的其他物品著手調查，並調閱機場周邊監視畫面，希望能查到蛛絲馬跡。在確認外籍男子身分之後，接下來則會移交給桃園地檢署檢察官進行後續偵辦。
一名法官表示，對於男子行為，必須要視警檢提出的「證據能力」來認定，也是法官認定有罪依據；沒有證據能力，就不能用來認定犯罪。
例如當事人供述性證據，經常會變來變去，證明比較低，但若警方採集到男子已接觸到航空器，或者是攀爬進入機場管制區域的監視錄影器畫面，並且有破壞圍籬等事證，就可以作為量刑依據，即使當事人自始行使緘默權，仍可做為起訴或量刑依據。
桃園國際機場公司副總經理但昭璧表示，中華航空編號CI-28飛往帛琉班機，下午1時55分於S1滑行道待命準備至南跑道預備起飛時，突遭一身分不明外籍男子由一旁草叢闖入攀爬起落架，後方韓亞航班機機長發現通報塔台，飛機也立刻停飛。
但昭璧指出，航務處獲報立刻會同航警局人員趕到滑行道上，並在2時10分把外籍男子制伏押回。桃機職員表示，男子並非瘖啞人士，懷疑他使用語言不是英語而無法溝通，但可以確認男子並非旅客。
對於外傳男子隨身行李內有反光背心，瓦斯爐點火器數支，還有一張看不懂的手繪圖，以及男子是由機場南側大園方向闖入，然後潛伏躺在跑道旁的草地上等說法，警方表示一切都在調查中，不願證實。
男子今（3）日上午9時40分被押解到上車前不發一語，警方將男子隨身所攜帶的2個背包帶上車，將移交桃園地檢署進行偵辦。

攀飛機起落架試圖偷渡，各國案例層出不窮
桃園機場2日有一名外籍男子闖入管制區，爬上準備起飛的班機起落架，疑似企圖偷渡，所幸遭到阻止。其實國外的類似案例層出不窮，甚至有少數偷渡者成功捱過漫長且危險的高空旅程。

►藏匿機身偷渡的頻率多高？

英國廣播公司（BBC）今（2019）年7月報導，舉英國民航局（Civil Aviation Authority）最新數據為例，2004年1月至2015年3月間，英國各地機場共發現6名偷渡客。另有1名偷渡客在國外機場被發現躲在一架英國航機上。
美國聯邦航空總署（U.S. Federal Aviation Administration）也有數據顯示，1947年至2012年間，全球共有96人在飛航期間，躲在85架班機的機下輪艙。
航空專家金恩（Irene King）則告訴BBC，許多偷渡客並未成功抵達目的地，其人數難以估算。

►有多少偷渡客因此死亡？

英國已發現這類偷渡客喪命的若干案例。
2001年：21歲巴基斯坦人阿亞斯（Mohammed Ayaz）的遺體，出現在倫敦希斯羅機場（Heathrow Airport）附近列治文區（Richmond）一處商家的停車場。4年前也有偷渡客從飛機墜落，掉進同一處商家附近的煤氣廠。
2007年：英國航空公司（British Airways）一架班機在美國洛杉磯時，發現起落架上有一名年輕男子的遺體。
2012年8月：一架來自南非開普敦（Cape Town）的飛機抵達希斯羅機場後，在輪艙發現一具男性遺體。
2012年9月：26歲莫三比克人瑪塔達（Jose Matada）的遺體出現在西倫敦摩特雷克（Mortlake）街上。瑪塔達透過一架來自安哥拉的飛機偷渡，半途從機上墜落，因身上多處傷勢不治。
2015年6月：一名男子死在列治文區一個辦公室的屋頂，希斯羅機場另有一人被發現時情況危急。據信兩人攀上一架從南非約翰尼斯堡（Johannesburg）起飛的英航班機。
2019年6月：一名疑似偷渡客的男子從肯亞航空（Kenya Airways）班機墜落，摔進倫敦西南區克利普罕（Clapham）的民宅花園。遺體一公尺外當時有名男子正在做日光浴。
至於生還者偷渡上的飛機航程一般很短，而且他們年紀很輕。
2010年6月，一名20歲羅馬尼亞人從奧地利維也納（Vienna）啟程後，到希斯羅機場才被發現藏在輪艙內。當時飛機因天候不佳，高度一直保持低於2萬5000英尺。
美國聯邦航空總署提到1947至2012年間全球有96名偷渡客躲在輪艙，其中23人活著撐完航程，比例約為1/4。

►其他存活案例

1969年：22歲的蘇卡拉斯（Armando Socarras Ramirez）躲在飛機起落架輪艙，成功從古巴哈瓦那飛往西班牙馬德里，儘管他被凍傷，但身體沒有受到重大傷害。
1996年：23歲的塞尼（Pardeep Saini）躲在客機輪艙內，從印度德里飛往英國倫敦，途中歷經10個小時。
2000年：馬魯希（Fidel Maruhi）藏匿在一架波音747客機的輪艙，從太平洋大溪地飛往美國洛杉磯，這趟旅程長達4000英里（約6440公里）。
2002年：22歲的阿爾瓦雷茲（Victor Alvarez Molina）躲藏在DC-10客機的輪艙內，從古巴飛往加拿大蒙特婁，期間歷經4小時。
2014年：15歲少年艾布迪（Yahya Abdi）躲在波音767班機的輪艙內，從美國加州聖荷西（San Jose）飛到夏威夷毛伊島。

►飛行途中的狀況

如果有人試圖躲在飛機輪艙，他將面臨極端狀況所構成的嚴重風險。
這些風險包括起落架縮回輪艙時，偷渡客可能意外遭壓傷，飛行期間可能會受到凍傷、聽力喪失、耳鳴及酸中毒，體液中累積太多酸可能會導致昏迷或死亡。
飛行過程中，溫度可能降到攝氏零下63度，導致體溫過低症狀。
飛機在1萬8000英尺（約5490公尺）高空，偷渡者會開始有缺氧現象，這會造成虛弱、顫抖、輕微頭暈和視力等問題。
當飛機來到2萬2000英尺（約6710公尺）高空時，人體的血氧濃度會下降，偷渡者將很難保持清醒。
到了3萬3000英尺（約1萬公尺）或更高的高度，偷渡者的肺部需要人工壓力才能正常運作。
到了航程末段，輪艙艙門會在離地數千英尺高空再度打開以便降落，偷渡者可能因此跌落摔死。

►偷渡客如何攀上機身？

有些地方的機場管制區維安不夠嚴謹，若未妥善檢查，偷渡客就有可趁之機。
2012年8月就有一名男子偷偷攀上南非開普敦（Cape Town）飛往倫敦的班機，但警告來得太晚。機組員升空後才接獲通知，開普敦一座維安柵欄被破壞，有人看到男子爬進輪艙。這名偷渡客最後不幸喪命。

►誰會當偷渡客？

偷渡客多半企圖從開發中國家前往歐洲或北美，以男性為主。
曾有人提到某些偷渡客試圖躲避母國迫害或逃離衝突，也有人可能是想出國找工作，追尋更美好的生活。
英國慈善組織難民理事會（Refugee Council）成員陶艾爾（Lisa Doyle）對此表示：「我們呼籲政府提供比較安全和經常性的難民入境路線，作為避免這類悲劇事件發生的重要方式。」

The foreign man’s peach machine climbed onto the flight landing gear ready to take off, and the transfer of the peach inspection still did not say a word.
03 Nov 2019, 03:20 by Lo


What we want you to know is that the foreign man broke into the Taoyuan Airport Control Zone on the afternoon of the 2nd and climbed onto the landing gear of the flight that was preparing to take off. He was suspected of attempting to sneak into the flight. The flight was delayed for about 3 hours. This is the history of the peach machine. One suffers. The traffic police investigation found that there were no documents and entry and exit information on the man, and the nationality status was to be investigated.



(Central News Agency) Taoyuan International Airport yesterday (2) occurred a foreign man broke into the control area and climbed the flight landing gear case for the flight. Since the man was arrested by the police and refused to cooperate with the investigation, the air traffic police left him in the detention center last night.
The foreign man broke into the Taoyuan Airport Control Zone on the afternoon of the 2nd and climbed onto the landing gear for the flight that was preparing to take off. He was suspected of attempting to smuggle and was prevented from being arrested. The flight was delayed for about three hours. This is the first time in the history of the peach machine. The traffic police investigation found that there were no documents and entry and exit information on the man, and the nationality status was to be investigated.
The police said that since the man had invaded the control area, it was imperative for the police to find out exactly how to enter because the move involved the Aviation Security Act. In addition, the foreign man also had contact with the aircraft, which may also affect the safety of the flight.
In addition, how men enter Taiwan, which involves the issue of entry and exit, whether or not to smuggle also need to be verified; if illegal entry, it is possible to violate the Article 74 of the Immigration and Immigration Act, and to go abroad without permission to enter the country or to be prohibited from going abroad. At the end of the period of 3 years imprisonment, criminal detention or section or a new NT$90,000 fine. The police are currently investigating these directions.
The police said that because the man was still unwilling to speak in the evening, he was first placed in the detention center of the Taoyuan Airport Air Traffic Police Bureau. He hoped that he would calm down and try to induce him to open the investigation for a useful clue. To facilitate the investigation of the case.
In addition, the police also hope to identify the man's identity through fingerprints, irises, etc., and also investigate other items in the men's luggage, and read the surveillance screen around the airport, hoping to find clues. After confirming the status of the foreign man, it will be handed over to the procurator of the Taoyuan District Inspection Office for follow-up investigation.
A judge said that for men's behavior, it must be identified by the ""evidence ability"" proposed by the police, and it is also the basis for the judge to be found guilty; without the ability of evidence, it cannot be used to identify a crime.
For example, the confession evidence of the party often changes and proves to be relatively low. However, if the police collects the man’s contact with the aircraft, or climbs into the surveillance video of the airport control area, and has evidence of damage to the fence. It can be used as a basis for sentencing, even if the parties exercise their right to silence, they can still be used as a basis for prosecution or sentencing.

Climbing the aircraft landing gear to try to sneak, the national case is endless
On the 2nd, a foreign man in Taoyuan Airport broke into the control area and climbed the flight landing gear ready to take off. He was suspected of attempting to sneak into the area. Fortunately, he was prevented. In fact, similar cases from abroad have emerged in an endless stream, and even a few stowaways have successfully survived long and dangerous high-altitude journeys.

►How high is the frequency of hiding a fuselage?

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported in July (2019) that the latest data from the Civil Aviation Authority was taken as an example. From January 2004 to March 2015, six illegal immigrants were found at airports across the UK. Another smuggler was found hiding at a foreign airport on a British aircraft.
According to data from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, between 1947 and 2012, a total of 96 people around the world were hiding in the undercarriage of 85 flights during the flight.
Aviation expert Irene King told the BBC that many illegal immigrants did not successfully reach their destination, and the number is difficult to estimate.

►How many illegal immigrants died as a result?

The United Kingdom has found a number of cases in which such smugglers have lost their lives.
2001: The body of a 21-year-old Pakistani Mohammed Ayaz appears in a parking lot at a merchant in Richmond, near Heathrow Airport in London. Four years ago, some smugglers fell from the plane and fell into a gas plant near the same business.
2007: British Airways, a flight in Los Angeles, found the body of a young man on the landing gear.
August 2012: A plane from Cape Town, South Africa, arrived at Heathrow Airport and found a male body in the wheel bay.
September 2012: The body of the 26-year-old Mozambique Jose Matada appears on Mortlake Street in West London. Matada sneaked through a plane from Angola and fell from the plane halfway through the scene.
June 2015: A man died on the roof of an office in Richmond, and another person at Heathrow was found to be in critical condition. The two are believed to have climbed a British flight from Johannesburg, South Africa.
June 2019: A man suspected of being a smuggler fell from a Kenya Airways flight and fell into a residential garden in Clapham, southwest London. One man a metre away from the body was sunbathing.
As for the survivors, the voyages of the planes are generally very short, and they are very young.
In June 2010, a 20-year-old Romanian was found in Vienna, Austria, and was found hidden in the wheel cabin at Heathrow Airport. At that time, the aircraft was kept below 25,000 feet due to poor weather.
The US Federal Aviation Administration mentioned that between 1947 and 2012, 96 illegal immigrants were hiding in the wheel wells, and 23 of them lived on the voyage, a ratio of about 1/4.

►Other survival cases

1969: 22-year-old Armando Socarras Ramirez hid in the landing gear of the aircraft and successfully flew from Havana, Cuba, to Madrid, Spain. Although he was frostbitten, his body was not seriously injured.
1996: 23-year-old Pardeep Saini hides in the passenger cabin and travels from Delhi, India to London, England, for 10 hours.
2000: Fidel Maruhi hides in a wheeled cabin of a Boeing 747, flying from Pacific Tahiti to Los Angeles, which lasts 4,000 miles (about 6,440 kilometers).
2002: 22-year-old Victor Alvarez Molina hides in the wheelhouse of a DC-10 airliner and travels from Cuba to Montreal, Canada, for four hours.
2014: 15-year-old Yahya Abdi flies in the wheel room of the Boeing 767 flight from San Jose, Calif., to Maui, Hawaii.

►The situation on the way to flight

If someone tries to hide in the aircraft wheel well, he will face a serious risk of extreme conditions.
These risks include accidental crushing of the smugglers when the landing gear is retracted. During the flight, frostbite, hearing loss, tinnitus and acidosis may occur. Accumulation of too much acid in body fluids may lead to coma or death.
During the flight, the temperature may drop to minus 63 degrees Celsius, causing symptoms of hypothermia.
At an altitude of 18,000 feet (about 5,490 meters), stowaways will begin to have hypoxia, which can cause problems such as weakness, trembling, slight dizziness and vision.
When the plane reaches an altitude of 22,000 feet (about 6710 meters), the blood oxygen concentration of the human body will drop, and it will be difficult for the stowaway to stay awake.
At a height of 33,000 feet (about 10,000 meters) or higher, the lungs of stowaways require artificial pressure to function properly.
At the end of the voyage, the cabin door will be opened again for thousands of feet off the ground to land, and the stowaway may fall and fall.

►How do stolen passengers climb the fuselage?

In some places, the airport control area is not rigorous enough. If it is not properly checked, the illegal immigrants will have a chance.
In August 2012, a man sneaked into a flight to Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa, but the warning came too late. The crew was notified only after the lift was lifted. A Vian fence in Cape Town was destroyed and someone saw the man climb into the wheel well. The stowaway was finally killed.

► Who will be a smuggler?

Most of the illegal immigrants attempt to travel from developing countries to Europe or North America, mainly to men.
It has been mentioned that some illegal immigrants try to avoid the persecution or escape of conflict in their home country, and some may want to go abroad to find a job and pursue a better life.
Lisa Doyle, a member of the British Refugee Council, said: ""We call on the government to provide safer and more frequent refugee entry routes as an important way to avoid such tragedies.""
