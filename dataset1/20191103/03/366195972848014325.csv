While his self-titled debut arrived in September, cracking the Top 5 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, GASHI has already returned to serves fans up with a new offering in the form of his ""Mr. Ferrari"" track.
Produced by Stargate, the new selection finds GASHI positioned over a pop-laced backdrop as he continues to deliver on familiar boasts: ""Don't you forget how you still owe me/Cause we know that the drip ain't free.""
The track is equally matched in a retro-futuristic visual that finds GASHI flexing in a vintage Ferrari while exploring a virtual world topped off with actual VHS footage.


Quotable Lyrics


I don't fall in love all the time'Cause that's the way I lost my mindI fell in love with my ride'Cause that's the way to the money
