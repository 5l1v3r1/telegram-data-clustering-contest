      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Thousands of people are marching to show their support for Lebanon’s president and his proposed political reforms.</p>
      <p>The demonstration near Michel Aoun’s presidential palace in southeastern Beirut comes after more than two weeks of widespread anti-government demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Another such anti-government protest is scheduled for later Sunday in central Beirut.</p>
      <p>These demonstrations have united people from the country’s many religious sects and factions against the political class.</p>
      <p>Those leaders have ruled Lebanon since the 1975-1990 civil war, and are widely seen as having tanked the economy.</p>
      <p>Aoun, one of the main targets of the protesters’ anger, gave a speech late Thursday proposing that Lebanon should move away from the decades-old sectarian political system. He said the country is at a “dangerous crossroads.”</p>
