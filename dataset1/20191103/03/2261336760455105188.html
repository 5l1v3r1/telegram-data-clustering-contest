      <p>The UFC 244 PPV main card just watched the #9 ranked welterweight, Stephen Thompson, and the #14 ranked Vicente Luque bang it out for three rounds. Luque had strong moments in the first act, but Thompson got it together and began to hurt and outland his opposition. When the dust had settled, it was Thompson who took home the unanimous decision to get himself back into the win column.</p>

      <p>Luque came out attacking the legs right away. Thompson was elusive as always, using his footwork to stay on the outside. Luque was finding success with throwing his punches in combinations, scoring with his left hand. Thompson was landing counters, but Luque seemed unfazed by them.</p>
      <p>Thompson started exploding in with straight punches early in the second act. He then landed a sweet side kick that knocked over Luque. Thompson stunned Luque, causing him to cover up, but he recovered quickly. Luque returned fire, landing clean punches that backed off the advancing Wonderboy. Thompson started to put it on Luque, bloodying up his increasingly stationary opposition.</p>
      <p>Thompson hit another side kick that knocked over Luque early in the final round. He then launched a left hand that knocked down his opponent. Thompson went in for the kill with ground strikes, but allowed Luque to stand back up. Luque kept throwing, but Thompson was so fluid with his movement, that Vicente just couldn’t land clean. Another cross dazed Luque, causing him to shell up, but he survived.</p>
