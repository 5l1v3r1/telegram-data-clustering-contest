開槍港警秘密搬家 躲追殺三週不敢出門

03 Nov 2019, 03:37

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】香港反送中抗爭持續至今，警方暴力不斷升級，開真槍已成為常態。日前，一名香港警察向美媒透露，他對示威者開槍後承受極大壓力，憤怒的民眾將他個人資料在網路曝光，甚至有人出價50萬港幣追殺他。他為此恐懼地立刻秘密搬家，三週不敢踏出房門。

開槍港警被追殺

如今的香港被指重演1989年六四天安門慘案，香港警方已開始對示威民眾開真槍，至少2名中學生中彈入院，其中一名中學生被警察近距離開槍射中左胸口，差點喪生。
不過，這些被中共當局及港府充當暴力鎮壓工具的警察，也勢必要為自己的暴力行為承擔後果。香港示威群眾嚴厲譴責警方濫權濫暴，5大訴求之一就是要求進行獨立調查，追究暴警責任。
近日，一名曾對示威者開真槍的香港警察Jacky（化名）接受彭博社專訪時坦言，他為此承受了極大壓力，開槍後僅2天，憤怒的香港民眾就將他及家人的資料在網路上曝光。
隨後，不斷有民眾打電話譴責他，有人詛咒他全家去死，甚至有人出價50萬港幣追殺他。而且他的女兒也遭池魚之殃，在學校的桌椅被塗鴉、破壞，迄今仍無法返校上課。Jacky出於恐懼立刻秘密搬離警察宿舍，而且三週都不敢踏出房門。
這名港警坦言，在一次抗議活動中，在與示威者前線對峙時，警方無法驅散示威民眾，令他感到害怕，於是對示威者開了真槍，「這是我第一次感到，不這樣做我一定會死。」
報導指出，Jacky是匿名受訪，他不願意公開案發細節，包括是在什麼時間、什麼場合開的真槍等。

警察內部分化 不願當作炮灰「送死」

這場反送中抗議活動將香港變成示威者與警察的戰場，港警在抗爭中淪為市民口中的「黑警」，而一些警察則將示威者稱為「蟑螂」，警民之間出現前所未有的對立情緒，且愈演愈烈，社會裂痕日益加深。
這場抗爭也使警隊內部出現分化。早在7月份，就有超過200名香港警察家屬向特首林鄭月娥發出聯署公開信，要求港府「政治問題政治解決」，不要將警察當作人肉盾牌。
還有不少警察抱怨道：「政治問題是要政治解決，政府無能，警隊高層不斷把我們推去『送死』。」

港警披露：部分警察已失控

曾在香港警隊工作了11年的邱汶珊說，「我覺得政府好像是躲在了警隊後面」，「好多警察在下班脫下制服後，都是普通的香港市民。我們都是香港公民，但政府似乎並不在乎街上發生流血事件。」
6月16日的2百萬人大遊行，邱汶珊被派到現場監視示威者，抗議者從她身邊經過時大聲地叫她「黑警」。那一刻起，她開始覺得自己可能「站錯了陣營」。
更令邱汶珊失望的是：7月21日，一群身穿白衣的暴徒在元朗火車站無差別地毆打抗議者，而警察——她以前的同事們，就站在一旁。
36歲的邱汶珊在7月已辭職，並公開批評港府。她認為，部分警察已經失控，警方使用了過分的武力。「作為一名訓練有素的警官，我知道他們的行為並不完全合法。」
「你看到很多畫面，警察身上很多裝備，他一手就可以抓到那個人，那人都站不穩了，你還要打他，我覺得太過分了。」

中共邪招在香港上演

《大紀元》報導說，中共近百年積累的整治人的邪術，正在香港上演。中共邪招是：煽動仇恨，讓警民、港人互鬥，製造恐怖，達到讓香港各界再也無法承受這樣的恐怖和社會亂象時，「跪求」中共出手平暴的目的。
不願透露身份的警員Tom表示，他是警隊中少見的支持「反送中」的。他認為，反送中造成今天的困局，始作俑者是政府。警隊也是被政府擺上台的。
另一名警員Peter在警署負責後勤執法工作，他贊成成立獨立調查委員會。他認為，整場風波源於政府處理不當，卻讓前線警察成為箭靶。他們二人都表示打算辭去警察工作，甚至萌生移民念頭。
香港「警察隊員佐級協會」主席林志偉7月15日曾對媒體表示，前線同仁（指執勤的普通警察）的怨氣很大，他們成了港府與市民矛盾的「磨心」而左右為難。
警察隊員佐級協會代表了香港警界最基層的民意。該協會在7月14日也發表聲明稱，應確保執勤人員在行動中的安全，不應指派人員執行可能引致受傷的任務或到危險的地方執勤。
隨後，一位警察家屬李某在香港網路電台節目中表示，「警察隊員佐級協會」的聲明不可輕忽，那相當於是為香港廣大基層警員發出的「求救訊號」。
這位警察家屬表示，當權者就想要在衝突中鬧出人命，而且最希望有人能入浩園（專門安葬殉職公務員的墓地），以便藉此機會將民意傾向翻盤。
她呼籲前線警察，不要忘記自己保護市民的初心，更不要變成一具屍體被他人踩著上位。
8月25日，港警家屬冒雨舉行「還警於民」集會，他們提出的訴求，包括成立全面獨立調查委員會，呼籲警隊高層重定行動手法，懇請前線警察克己自律等。

Shot of the Hong Kong police secretly moved to hide and chase three weeks without going out

03 Nov 2019, 03:37

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The protests in Hong Kong's anti-delivery have continued to this day, police violence has escalated, and the opening of real guns has become the norm. A few days ago, a Hong Kong police revealed to the US media that he was under great pressure from the demonstrators. The angry people exposed his personal information on the Internet, and some even bid for 500,000 Hong Kong dollars to kill him. For this reason, he immediately moved secretly in fear, and he did not dare to step out of the house for three weeks.

Shot of the port police was chased

Nowadays, Hong Kong is accused of repeating the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989. The Hong Kong police have started shooting fire at the demonstrators. At least two middle school students were shot in the hospital. One of the middle school students was shot at the close of the left chest by the police and almost lost their lives.
However, these police officers, who have been used as violent repression tools by the Chinese authorities and the Hong Kong Government, are also bound to bear the consequences for their violence. The demonstrators in Hong Kong severely condemned the police for abuse of power. One of the five major demands was to demand an independent investigation and investigate the responsibility of the police.
Recently, a Hong Kong police officer, Jacky (pseudonym) who had fired a gun at the demonstrators, accepted an interview with Bloomberg. He admitted that he was under great pressure. Only two days after the shooting, the angry Hong Kong people would inform him and his family. Exposure on the web.
Subsequently, people continued to call to condemn him. Some people cursed his family to die, and some even bid for 500,000 Hong Kong dollars to kill him. Moreover, his daughter was also smashed by the fish, and the tables and chairs in the school were graffiti and destroyed. So far, it is still impossible to return to school. Jacky immediately moved out of the police quarter in fear, and did not dare to step out of the house for three weeks.
The Hong Kong police frankly stated that during a protest, when confronted with the demonstrators’ front line, the police could not disperse the demonstrators and made him feel scared. So he fired a real gun on the demonstrators. ""This is the first time I feel that this is not the case. I will definitely die if I do.""
The report pointed out that Jacky was interviewed anonymously, and he was not willing to disclose the details of the case, including when and where the guns were opened.

Internal division of the police, not willing to use as cannon fodder

The anti-delivery protests turned Hong Kong into a battlefield between demonstrators and police. The Hong Kong police became a ""black police"" in the public's mouth, and some police officers called the demonstrators ""蟑螂"", an unprecedented presence among police and civilians. The opposite emotions are growing and the social rift is deepening.
This struggle also caused differentiation within the police force. As early as July, more than 200 Hong Kong police family members issued an open letter to the Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue, asking the Hong Kong Government to ""politically resolve political issues"" and not to use the police as human shields.
Many police officers complained: ""The political issue is to be resolved politically. The government is incompetent. The top of the police force constantly pushes us to ""send to death.""

Hong Kong Police revealed: some police officers have lost control

""I think the Government seems to be hiding behind the police,"" said Mr. Cheung Wing-shan, who has worked in the Hong Kong Police Force for 11 years. ""A lot of police officers are ordinary Hong Kong citizens after they get off work. We are all Hong Kong citizens. But the government does not seem to care about the bloodshed on the street.""
On June 16th, the 2 million people marched, and Qiu Wenshan was sent to the scene to monitor the demonstrators. When the protesters passed by her, they called her ""black police"" loudly. From that moment on, she began to feel that she might ""get the wrong camp.""
What disappoints Qiu Wenshan is that on July 21, a group of white-clothed mobs beat the protesters in Yuen Long Railway Station indiscriminately, and the police, her former colleagues, stood by.
Qiu Wenshan, 36, resigned in July and publicly criticized the Hong Kong government. She believes that some police officers have lost control and the police have used excessive force. ""As a well-trained police officer, I know that their actions are not completely legal.""
""You see a lot of pictures, the police have a lot of equipment, he can catch that person with one hand, that person is not standing, you have to beat him, I think it is too much.""

The CCP’s evil tricks staged in Hong Kong

The Epoch Times reported that the sorcerer of the rectification of the people accumulated by the CCP in the past 100 years is being staged in Hong Kong. The evil tricks of the CCP are: inciting hatred, allowing the police and the people of Hong Kong to fight each other and creating terror. When the Hong Kong people can no longer afford such horror and social chaos, they pleaded for the purpose of tyranny.
Tom, a police officer who did not want to disclose his identity, said that he was a rare supporter of the police force. He believes that the anti-delivery has caused the dilemma of today, and the initiator is the government. The police force was also put on the stage by the government.
Another police officer, Peter, is responsible for logistics enforcement at the police station. He is in favor of setting up an independent investigation committee. He believes that the whole incident was caused by the government's improper handling, but the frontline police became an archery target. Both of them expressed their intention to resign from the police work and even thought about immigration.
Lin Zhiwei, chairman of the Hong Kong ""Police Players Association"", told the media on July 15 that the frontline colleagues (referring to the ordinary police on duty) were very resentful. They became the ""hearts"" of the contradiction between the Hong Kong Government and the public.
The Police Team and the Zoning Association represent the most grassroots public opinion in the Hong Kong police community. The association also issued a statement on July 14 stating that it is important to ensure that the officers on duty are safe in their operations and that no personnel should be assigned to perform tasks that may lead to injury or to work in dangerous places.
Subsequently, a police officer's family member Lee said in a Hong Kong Internet radio program that the ""police team member association"" statement should not be neglected, which is equivalent to the ""warning signal"" issued by the majority of grassroots police officers in Hong Kong.
The police family said that those in power wanted to make a living in the conflict, and most hoped that someone could enter the Haoyuan (specially buried in the cemetery of civil servants) in order to take the opportunity to turn public opinion.
She called on the frontline police, don't forget to protect the public's initial intentions, and don't become a body to be stepped on by others.
On August 25, the Hong Kong police officers took part in a rally to ""return the police to the people"". Their appeals included the establishment of a comprehensive independent investigation committee, calling on the police to re-define their actions and urge the frontline police to self-discipline.
