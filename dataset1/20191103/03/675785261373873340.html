      <h1>Man Utd special edition shirt to celebrate Chinese New Year leaked</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United are set to commemorate Chinese New Year with an outlandish new shirt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T03:55:36+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 03:55</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are set to launch an outlandish shirt to commemorate Chinese New Year.</p>
      <p>The first pictures of the eccentric kit have been leaked by <a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2019/10/dragon-adidas-manchester-united-2020-chinese-new-year-kit.html">FootyHeadlines.com</a> , with the limited edition item set to go on sale nearer the Chinese New Year on January 25.</p>
      <p>But the shirt is not set to be worn by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in an official match, instead being sold through the Adidas store.</p>
      <p>The shirt fits the same template as the controversial Adidas x EA Sports shirts released last year which also featured in FIFA 19 but were not worn in real life.</p>
      <p>This time, the limited edition kit includes a black v-neck collar with a gold United badge centrally located and outlandish Chinese dragons printed all over the red shirt.</p>

      <p>It is said to be part of a wider range, also including a pair of trousers shown in the leaked images with more items to mark Chinese New Year potentially set to be unveiled at a later date.</p>
      <p>The report also claims <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , Bayern Munich, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> will launch similar clothing items to celebrate the event.</p>

      <p>United have already opted for an eccentric snakeskin away kit this season, with the Adidas kit dividing opinion.</p>
      <p>There have been mixed responses at best to the Chinese New Year shirt, which is certainly eye-catching, although those who are not a fan can take comfort in the fact it will not be seen on the pitch.</p>
