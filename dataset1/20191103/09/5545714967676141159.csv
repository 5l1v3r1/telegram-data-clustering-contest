You can, and absolutely should, buy Frog Detective for a dollar
[Insert RoboCop meme here]

The Haunted Island, a Frog Detective Game is goofy and delightful in all the right ways. It’s a short experience, at just about an hour long, but the length is perfect for the story it’s trying to tell. I loved it at release, but I’ve found myself growing more and more fond of it over time. I miss its wholesome jokes and references to the ever-impressive Lobster Cop, who I am one-hundred percent down to see receive his own spinoff series. He’s so dang mysterious, and I hear he’s got mad skills.
While we may never get the chance to dive deeper into the Lobster Cop lore we all crave and deserve, the sequel to the first game, Frog Detective 2: The Case of the Invisible Wizard, is gearing up to release sometime in the next couple of months, and I couldn't be more excited!



If you’re a total dork who never played the original, it’s too late. You’re already dead to me. You had your chance. We can still be friends, but I’m duty-bound to slip you a judging side-eye when you’re not looking for the foreseeable future. My hands are tied. I don't make the rules.
Luckily, thanks to this super neat Humble Day of the Devs 2019 Bundle, you’ve been given the opportunity to dive in and redeem yourself for the low price of one dollar. That same dollar will get you a copy of the surreal painting adventure known as ART SQOOL. The “pay more than the average” tier offers up both Battle Chef Brigade and Flipping Death. I still haven’t yet gotten around to the former, but the latter is the spiritual successor to the extremely excellent Stick it to The Man. It never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it’s definitely worth it for existing fans.
Lastly, with the final tier, coughing up nine dollars will get you copies of Minit (which Brett insists is awesome and I need to finally get around to playing) as well as Toejam & Earl: Back in the Groove, a game that CJ gave a whopping 9.5/10 score in his review.
All in all, this is a damn solid bundle and a great opportunity for me to pester all of you to finally play Frog Detective. That sounds like a win to me.

Disclosure-bot: Just in case the editor neglected to mention it, we have zero control when deals start and end. Deals can sometimes be gone within minutes (please don't shoot the messenger). Trying deal links even hours after this article's time stamp may lead to self-punching, so maybe bookmark our video game deals if you're on the hunt. Also, it goes without saying, but some shopping links do directly support the author. If you've spotted any inaccuracy please let us know asap.
