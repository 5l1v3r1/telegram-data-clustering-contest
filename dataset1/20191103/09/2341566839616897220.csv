敘利亞邊境城鎮炸彈攻擊13死30傷 土耳其歸咎庫德民兵

（中央社伊斯坦堡2日綜合外電報導）親土耳其部隊上個月奪占的敘利亞邊境城鎮特爾阿布雅德（Tel Abyad）市場今天發生汽車炸彈攻擊，造成13死30傷。安卡拉當局指責庫德族民兵「人民保衛軍」（YPG）犯案。
設在英國的「敘利亞人權瞭望台組織」（Syrian Observatory for Human Rights）表示，特爾阿布雅德的死傷者包括親土耳其戰士及平民。土耳其國營安納杜魯新聞社（Anadolu Agency）報導稱，一部滿載炸彈車輛引爆後，炸死13人。
土耳其軍隊於10月9日對盤據敘利亞東北部的庫德族人民保衛軍發動越界攻擊，特爾阿布雅德是戰鬥最激烈的兩個邊境大城之一。土耳其軍隊的入侵行動招致國際譴責，YPG多年來一直與美軍聯手對抗激進組織伊斯蘭國（IS）。
在發生汽車炸彈攻擊前，敘利亞東北部經歷相對平靜兩週時間，且土耳其與俄羅斯部隊於一天前根據雙方所達成協議，開始聯手在當地執行地面巡邏任務。俄土兩國達成的協議，目的是要把YPG驅離土耳其邊界。
儘管莫斯科當局先前表示，YPG已根據協議從邊界後撤至少30公里，但安卡拉當局抱持懷疑立場，且倘若被它視為恐怖組織的庫德族民兵成員未撤離，它不排除發動新攻擊。
土耳其國防部發推文表示：「我們譴責血腥的庫德工人黨/人民保衛軍（PKK/YPG）恐怖分子，對特爾阿布雅德的無辜平民發動不人道攻擊，他們因為和平之泉行動（Operation Peace Spring）而得以重返鄉土及家園。」
土耳其總統府發言人卡林（Ibrahim Kalin）也指責YPG犯案。
記者尚未連絡到以YPG為首的「敘利亞民主力量」（Syrian Democratic Forces）針對此置評。

Syrian border town bomb attack 13 dead 30 wounds Turkey blames Kurdish militia
03 Nov 2019, 09:30 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Istanbul, 2nd comprehensive foreign news report) The car bomb attack on the Tel Abyad market in the Syrian border town, which was seized by the Turkish forces last month, caused 13 deaths and 30 injuries. The Ankara authorities accused the Kurdish militia of the People's Defence Force (YPG) of committing crimes.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the dead and wounded in Tel Abujad include pro-Turkey fighters and civilians. The Turkish state-run Anadolu Agency reported that 13 people were killed after a bomb-filled vehicle was detonated.
On October 9, the Turkish army launched a cross-border attack on the Kurdish People's Defence Forces in northeastern Syria. Tel Abujad was one of the two most powerful border cities. The invasion of the Turkish army has led to international condemnation, and YPG has been working with the US military for many years against the radical organization of the Islamic State (IS).
Before the car bomb attack, the northeastern part of Syria experienced a relatively quiet two weeks, and the Turkish and Russian forces began to jointly conduct ground patrols on the ground according to the agreement reached by the two sides one day ago. The agreement reached between Russia and Turkey aims to drive YPG out of the Turkish border.
Although the Moscow authorities had previously stated that YPG had withdrawn from the border by at least 30 kilometers under the agreement, the Ankara authorities held a skeptical position and that if the members of the Kurdish militia, which it considered to be a terrorist organization, had not withdrawn, it did not rule out launching new attacks.
The Turkish Ministry of Defence issued a tweet saying: ""We condemn the bloody Kurdish Workers' Party / People's Defence Force (PKK/YPG) terrorists and launch inhuman attacks against innocent civilians in Tel Abujad. They act because of the Fountain of Peace (Operation Peace Spring) is able to return to the home and home.""
Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for the Turkish presidential palace, also accused YPG of committing crimes.
The reporter has not yet contacted the Syrian Democratic Forces headed by YPG for comment.
