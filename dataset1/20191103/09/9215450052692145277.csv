動能ETF揀選有法 MTUM側重大型股｜吳瑞麟
03 Nov 2019, 09:00 by 投資
動能（momentum）作為主要的選股因子之一，近年可謂大放異彩，相關交易所買賣基金（ETF）中資產總值、平均每日成交量最高的iShares Edge MSCI美國動能ETF（美股代號：MTUM），過去三年累積總回報為60.44%；大幅拋離同期標準普爾500指數ETF（美股代號：SPY）的48.05%，表現理想。

然而，一如早前引述美國技術分析大師迪默（Walter Deemer）所言：「每次你自以為掌握解鎖市場之匙，那該死的鎖便會被人換掉。如果以為持有MTUM，就鐵定可以跑贏大市，過去一年恐怕頗覺失望，因MTUM一年總回報僅9.26%；SPY同期則為10.39%，MTUM略遜一籌。MTUM短線小幅跑輸大市，當然不構成甚麼「動能投資已死」的結論；不過詳細了解MTUM的組成，有助投資者選擇另一些動能ETF的可行之選。
MTUM側重大型股
MTUM的選股範圍是MSCI美國指數，當中包括大型股及中型股，從過去半年、一年的風險調整後回報，選出動能分數最高的約120支股票，再按流通市值加權。換言之，當升勢由少數超大市值巨企強勢領導，例如FANG加微軟（美股代號：MSFT），那MTUM將會極具優勢。因為最大市值的數支股票，已佔MTUM組合超過20%，影響力遠超市值處於末端的股份；相反，若領先股並非最大市值股份，甚至並非大型股，MTUM表現則可能稍嫌遜色。如前所述，市場尚有另一些動能ETF可供選擇，如Invesco 標普中型股動能ETF（美股代號：XMMO）就是一例。根據ETFdb.com的排行榜，XMMO於動能ETF中，資產總值、平均每日成交量均排行第三位，選股範圍為標普400中型股指數，成分股會按過去一年的表現分成五級，動能最高的一級（頭20%）才可入選。
截至10月21日，XMMO持股78隻，不論個股佔比及板塊佔比，都比MTUM平均。例如佔比最大的個股為金融股WR Berkley（美股代號：WRB），為3.54%；MTUM比重首位為P&G（美股代號：PG），佔5%。XMMO的頭十大持股，總共佔組合25.53%；而 MTUM十大持股，已佔組合38.8%；換言之，若最大一批持股，因個股消息或市場口味轉變，有何「冬瓜豆腐」，則XMMO所受影響，會比MTUM要輕。此外，XMMO的板塊分布，亦比較平均，佔比較重為房地產（15.42%）、醫護（13.73%）、資訊科技（13.67%）、金融（12.69%）及自主消費（12.05%），全部不過兩成，差別不大。
相比之下，MTUM板塊則較集中於資訊科技（38.32%）和醫護（12.33%）；如上所述，若科技板塊突遭拋售，會對MTUM打擊較大，不難明白。若論過去一年表現，XMMO一年總回報20.7%，跑贏同標標指400中型股ETF（美股代號：MDY）的5.53%，亦比MTUM、SPY要好。當然，要注意中型股的波動性會高於大型股，過去一年XMMO的波幅為21.2%，高於MTUM（18.2%）和SPY（15.2%），在注碼上切勿太過進取。此外，亦應長期觀察XMMO與MTUM兩者的相對強度，始終風水輪流轉，當大型強勢股再度主宰大市，便是時候轉回後者。

Kinetic Energy ETF picking method has a major MTUM side stock | Wu Ruilin
03 Nov 2019, 09:00 by Investment
Momentum, one of the main stock picking factors, has been a big hit in recent years. The iShares Edge MSCI US kinetic energy ETF with the highest total asset value and average daily trading volume in the ETFs (US stock code: MTUM) ), the cumulative total return for the past three years was 60.44%; sharply off the same period of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index ETF (US stock code: SPY) 48.05%, the performance is satisfactory.

However, as quoted by Walter Deemer, the American technical analysis guru earlier, “Every time you think you have the key to unlocking the market, the damn lock will be replaced. If you think you hold MTUM, then Tie Ding can outperform the market. I am afraid that I have been disappointed in the past year, because MTUM's total return is only 9.26% in one year; SPY is 10.39% in the same period, MTUM is slightly inferior. MTUM short-term underperforms the market, of course, does not constitute anything. The conclusion that kinetic energy investment is dead is good; however, a detailed understanding of the composition of MTUM will help investors choose the viable options for other kinetic energy ETFs.
Major stocks on the MTUM side
MTUM's stock selection range is the MSCI US Index, which includes large and medium-sized stocks. From the risk-adjusted returns of the past six months and one year, the 120 stocks with the highest kinetic scores are selected and then weighted by the market capitalization. In other words, when the uptrend is led by a few large-capacity companies, such as FANG plus Microsoft (US stock code: MSFT), then MTUM will be extremely advantageous. Because the stocks with the largest market capitalization have accounted for more than 20% of the MTUM portfolio, the influence of the supermarket is at the end of the shares; on the contrary, if the leading stock is not the largest market capitalization, or even large-cap stocks, MTUM performance may be slightly inferior. As mentioned earlier, there are other kinetic energy ETFs available in the market, such as the Invesco S&P Mid-Capital Ekins ETF (US stock code: XMMO). According to the ETFdb.com ranking, XMMO ranks third in terms of total assets and average daily volume in the kinetic energy ETF. The stock selection range is the S&P Midcap 400 Index, and the constituent stocks will be divided according to the performance of the past year. At the fifth level, the highest level of kinetic energy (the first 20%) can be selected.
As of October 21, XMMO holds 78 shares, regardless of the proportion of individual stocks and sectors, which is evener than MTUM. For example, the largest share of the stock is financial stock WR Berkley (US stock code: WRB), which is 3.54%; MTUM's first place is P&G (US stock code: PG), accounting for 5%. XMMO's top ten holdings accounted for 25.53% of the total; while MTUM's top ten holdings accounted for 38.8% of the portfolio; in other words, if the largest batch of shares held, due to individual stock news or market taste changes, what is the ""winter melon tofu"" , XMMO will be affected, it will be lighter than MTUM. In addition, XMMO's sector distribution is also relatively average, accounting for a relatively large proportion of real estate (15.42%), medical care (13.73%), information technology (13.67%), finance (12.69%) and self-consumption (12.05%), all but two Cheng, the difference is not big.
In contrast, the MTUM sector is more concentrated in information technology (38.32%) and medical care (12.33%); as mentioned above, if the technology sector suddenly sells, it will be a big blow to MTUM, it is not difficult to understand. If the performance of the past year is over, XMMO's total return for the year is 20.7%, which beats 5.53% of the 400 medium-sized stock ETF (US stock code: MDY), which is better than MTUM and SPY. Of course, it should be noted that the volatility of mid-cap stocks will be higher than that of large-cap stocks. In the past year, XMMO's volatility was 21.2%, higher than MTUM (18.2%) and SPY (15.2%), and should not be too aggressive in the bet. In addition, the relative strength of both XMMO and MTUM should be observed for a long time. The wind and water are always flowing. When large and powerful stocks once again dominate the market, it is time to turn back to the latter.
