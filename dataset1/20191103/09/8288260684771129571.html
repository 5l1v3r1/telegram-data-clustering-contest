      <h1>'Real deal!' - Aston Villa fans all saying the same thing about this player after Liverpool clash</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool reaction | The claret and blue faithful have had their say on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T09:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans have been full of praise for midfielder Marvelous Nakamba after his performance in the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe international <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-player-ratings-liverpool-17191100">put in another excellent display to further endear himself</a> to the claret and blue faithful.</p>
      <p>A summer signing from Club Brugge, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/marvelous-nakamba">Nakamba</a> has played every one of Villa's Premier League games since he made his on September 16 in a goalless draw with West Ham United.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old needed to get up to speed and now he's coping with the rigours of English top flight football he looks at home on the biggest stage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And there's no better platform to showcase your talents than a clash with the reigning European champions.</p>
      <p>Villa and Nakamba took Jurgen Klopp's Reds all the way, opening the scoring on the 21st minute and holding their own right until the last.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-17191526">Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane netted on the 87th and 94th minutes</a> to break Villa hearts but there were plenty of positives from the Villa Park clash and Nakamba was one of them.</p>
      <p>The claret and blue faithful took to social media to praise Nakamba in their droves post match.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction...</i>
      </p>
      <p>@ <b>FaraiJulian</b> : Villa will be tweeting all season long because Nakamba is the real deal!    I predict he will keep this form up &amp; another premier league club will definitely come for him at the end</p>
      <p>@ <b>Villanews11</b> : Him and trez were brilliant</p>
