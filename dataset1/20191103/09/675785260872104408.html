      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T09:06:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 09:06</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Letcher, Ben Weich</a></address>
      <p>A mum-of-two has spoken of a debilitating condition which left her with periods so painful she would "vomit and pass out" - leaving her begging her doctors for a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>Jade Spargo, who lives in Truro, Cornwall with her partner Sabrina and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pregnancy">two young daughters</a> , was diagnosed with the relatively-common endometriosis two years ago.</p>
      <p>This was despite complaining for decades about the pain for a decade.</p>
      <p>Endometriosis is a painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old told <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/pain-plagued-woman-begged-hysterectomy-3487419">Cornwall Live</a> that battling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/periods">heavy periods</a> and agonising pain led to the deterioration of her mental health.</p>
      <p>To top it off, she was then diagnosed with a similar condition, adenomyosis, in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.</p>

      <p>For many, the only cure is a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>Jade said that medics told her that her symptoms were “just something that women have to put up with".</p>
      <p>She said: “Years went by and I thought this was just what being a woman was about. I figured it was a bit rubbish but I dealt with it. It settled down in my late teens and in my early 20s it all started again.</p>
      <p>“I started to get such painful and heavy periods that I would pass out and vomit. Again I started visiting the doctor's surgery regularly to try and get someone to listen to me and help me."</p>
      <p>Jade then pleaded with her doctors to refer her for a hysterectomy in her mid-20s, but said it was not something <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">medics</a> ever seriously entertained.</p>
      <h3>What is endometriosis?</h3>
      <p>Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus.</p>
      <p>It is a relatively common condition, primarily affecting girls and women of childbearing age. It is less common among women who have been through menopause.</p>
      <p>It can cause painful or heavy periods, and may also lead to infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems.</p>
      <p>Approximately 1.5 million women in Britain live with endometriosis.</p>
      <p>While it is a long-term condition, for which there is no cure, treatments to ease symptoms are available.</p>
      <p>More information from the NHS is available <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/">here</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She added: “She gave me another prescription for another type of hormone pill, even after I explained they don't help me and make it worse.</p>
      <p>"GPs kept telling me the pain was in my head. Even after ending up in A&amp;E in so much pain no one would take me seriously.”</p>
      <p>She finally achieved a breakthrough when, at 27, she visited a different GP, who officially diagnosed her with endometriosis.</p>
      <p>Jade said: “I had never even heart of it. She then referred me to the gynecology team at Royal Cornwall Hospital."</p>
      <p>She says that the surgeons also discovered that she had a "bulky uterus", which was caused by adenomyosis.</p>
      <p>Unlike endometriosis, which can be treated with hormone therapy, the only treatment for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>With her new diagnosis, doctors have finally given Jade the green light for a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>First, they will medically induce menopause.</p>

      <p>She said: “I am trying to raise awareness for adenomyosis. No-one knows what it is. Also endometriosis - it shouldn't have taken me thirteen years to get a diagnosis but it has.</p>
      <p>“At least this one has a cure. Mentally I'm doing much better now than I was a year ago. I must have been a nightmare to live with then.</p>
      <p>"My new team of doctors have been amazing to deal with. After so many doctors making me feel like I'm a hypochondriac and I'm being dramatic, it feels amazing to be acknowledged.</p>
      <p>"I have bipolar disorder and I'm worried about how the menopause will affect my mental health.</p>
      <p>"I'm nervous about silly things that 30-year-olds shouldn't have to worry about. It's going to be a bit strange.</p>
      <p>"My partner has been amazing. I had my big operation three weeks before our youngest daughter, Tilda was born.</p>
      <p>"She came three weeks after the operation but my partner encouraged me to have the surgery anyway.</p>
      <p>"Its been difficult having a new baby after the operation. Sometimes when I get the pains I say to her 'you have no idea what it feels like' and I forget that she has been through pregnancy and labour, but she is incredibly supportive."</p>
