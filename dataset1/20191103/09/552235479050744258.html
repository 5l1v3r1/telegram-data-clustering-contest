      <p>With plagues, floods and persecution you might not think the Bible is a source of humour.</p>
      <p>However, three Hamilton churches are taking to the stage to perform an innovative comedy night based on the scriptures.</p>
      <p>You might be familiar with TV show Whose Line Is It Anyway? and now Whose Word Is It Anyway? is coming to town.</p>
      <p>Cadzow Parish, St John’s Parish and Hamilton Old Parish have teamed up to form Drama Kirk.</p>
      <p>And they are performing an evening of Bible-inspired improvised comedy tomorrow (Friday, November 1) at 7pm in Hamilton Old Parish.</p>
      <p>Liz Blackman, who leads Drama Kirk, explained: “The opportunity to combine different performance styles and the occasional silly prop with Bible stories struck me as a great way to help us experience some parts of the Bible afresh.</p>
      <p>“Perhaps putting a different slant on things will help us understand them differently, or perhaps it will help it to stick in our memories.</p>
      <p>“Either way, it gives us an informal way to explore scripture.</p>
      <p>“Whilst improvised comedy is not an approach you might take for a Sunday morning service, it struck me as an ideal way to look at Friday night church, where we can all relax together.”</p>
      <p>All of the improvised material on the night will come from Bible stories suggested by the audience. You could, for example, see the Nativity as a spaghetti western, the book of Revelation as a Tarantino movie, hear Bible stories in the style of different authors or see well-known Bible characters interviewed by TV personalities.</p>
      <p>The organisers say that the evening promises to be a fresh, fun way to enjoy the scriptures, where anything is possible.</p>
      <p>Drama Kirk are already known locally for their innovative approach to bringing the Bible to life, which has included an annual large-scale Passion Play in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the comedy night are £5 and refreshments will be on sale at the interval. Go to www.eventbrite.com/e/whose-word-is-it-anyway-tickets-74877397311 for tickets.</p>
