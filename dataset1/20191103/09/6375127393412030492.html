      <h3>ORANI, Bataan -- Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) conferred Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) and agricultural equipment to farmers in Bataan.  </h3>
      <p>During the Farmers and Fishermen’s Summit 2019 held in Orani town, about 41 Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARB) received their CLOAs that cover 150 hectares of agricultural lands in Hermosa town.  </p>
      <p>Agrarian Reform Secretary John R. Castriciones urged the beneficiaries to do their part in improving their respective farmlands and elevating their economic lives.</p>
      <p>“We promise to give you support services like farm machines, access to credit and various trainings to help you sustain the gains that you reap from this land that is now legally yours,” Castriciones stressed.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet official also vowed housing projects for farmers, provision of crop insurance from the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation and AFFORD-ARB credit assistance from Land Bank of the Philippines, among others.</p>
      <p>Moreover, agrarian cooperatives in the province received farm machines and equipment under the Climate Resilient Farm Productivity Support Project.  </p>
      <p>It aims to boost farmers’ household income by modernizing their farming through the provision of new equipment.<br/>organized by Office of 1st District Representative Geraldine B. Roman to inform her constituents of the programs and policies of government agencies.</p>
