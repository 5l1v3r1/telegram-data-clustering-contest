Speaking about the mishap, a friend of the manager’s family and industry insider, who was present at the Bachchan's Diwali party, had stated, “While SRK did indeed jump into the fray to help Archana Sadanand by taking off his sherwani and got involved in the process too - I felt if it wasn’t for Aishwarya’s presence of mind the situation could have been much much worse for her— the fire was flaring up real quick and if she didn’t rip off Archana’s clothes like she did, to limit the damage - things could have turned out very different and graver than it is.”
It has been revealed to us that Aishwarya was in constant touch with her manager’s family and also wanted to cancel her even in Rome, but her team assured that things would be managed in her absence. We wish for a speedy recovery for Archana Sadanand.
