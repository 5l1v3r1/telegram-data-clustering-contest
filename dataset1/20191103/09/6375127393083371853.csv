KUNG nanaisin lamang ng TV host-actor-comedian and successful entrepreneur na si Luis Manzano (38) ay kaya na nitong bumuo  ng sarili niyang pamilya lalupa’t napaka-stable na ng kanyang estado sa buhay in terms of income.
Hinihintay na lamang umano ng kanyang 26-year-old girlfriend  of more than three years na si Jessy Mendiola ang wedding proposal at handa na rin umano nitong pasukin ang buhay may-asawa.
Kung ang entranged parents lamang ni Luis na sina Cong. Vilma Santos-Recto at Edu Manzano lamang ang masusunod ay gusto na umano ng dalawa na mag-asawa na ang kanilang panganay at kaisa-isang anak para magkaroon na rin sila ng apo.  Pero hindi naman nila puwedeng pangunahan ang desisyon ng kanilang binata at maghihintay lamang umano sila kung kelan ito mangyayari.
Bukod sa pagiging most in-demand TV host ng Kapamilya Network, pagiging actor-comedian at celebrity endorser, si Luis ay isa ring successful businessman who owns his own fleet of taxi, gasoline stations, perfume business at iba pang negosyo.  Napakasuwerte umano ni Jessy kapag si Luis ang kanyang napangasawa dahil bukod sa mabait at pagiging responsible nito, tiyak ding isa itong good provider at secured ang kanilang magiging pamilya.
Si Jessy ang ipinalit ni Luis nang sila’y magkahiwalay ni Angel Locsin na malapit nang ikasal.

Luis will be ahead of Angel

IF TV host-actor-comedian and successful entrepreneur Luis Manzano (38) only wants to build his own family, his state is already very stable in terms of income.
His 26-year-old girlfriend of more than three years, Jessy Mendiola, has been waiting for the wedding proposal and is ready to enter into married life.
If only Luis's entranged parents were Cong. Only Vilma Santos-Recto and Edu Manzano are expected to want the two to marry their first child and their only child so they can have grandchildren. But they cannot take the lead in their young men's decisions and they will have to wait for it to happen.
Besides being the most in-demand TV host of the Kapamilya Network, being an actor-comedian and celebrity endorser, Luis is also a successful businessman who owns his own fleet of taxis, gasoline stations, perfume businesses and other businesses. Jessy was very fortunate when Luis was his wife because besides his kindness and responsibility, he was also a good provider and secured their family.
Jessy replaced Luis when they were separated from Angel Locsin who was about to marry.
