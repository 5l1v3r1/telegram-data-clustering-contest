沙特阿美石油獲准上市 可能是最大規模IPO

03 Nov 2019, 09:45

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】沙特阿拉伯資本市場局（CMA）今天(3日)宣布，允許國營能源巨擘沙特阿美石油公司（Aramco）在國內股市上市。消息人士透露，該公司會在10日公布計劃首次公開募股說明書，而市場預料將在12月中展開交易。這可能是世界最大規模首次公開募股（IPO）。
這筆交易可能使阿美公司估值達到1.7兆美元，也是沙國王儲穆罕默德．沙爾曼（Mohammed bin Salman）改造經濟、擺脫國家對石油長期依賴的計劃核心。
法新社引述熟知這項募股計畫的消息人士報導，阿美石油公司料將在兩次交易賣出共5%股份，分別在12月沙特阿拉伯證交所（Tadawul）首次掛牌釋出2%股票、明年在海外交易所掛牌上市將再釋出3%股票，目前尚未選出地點。
外界原本預期阿美公司會在10月展開兩階段公開募股的第一部分，但程序遭到延後，據傳是因王儲不滿意對公司的估值不到預期的2兆美元。
阿美公司表示，今年前9月淨收入（net income）達680億美元，營收以及和銷售有關的其他收入總計2440億美元。去年淨收入則達到1110億美元，不但是蘋果公司的2倍，更是埃克森美孚（Exxon Mobil）、荷蘭皇家殼牌（Royal Dutch Shell）的好幾倍。
紐約時報形容，這可能是史上規模最大的IPO，可望打破中國電商巨頭阿里巴巴（Alibaba）2014年在美國紐約上市所創下的紀錄。

Saudi Aramco is approved to be listed, probably the largest IPO

03 Nov 2019, 09:45

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The Saudi Arabian Capital Markets Agency (CMA) announced today (3rd) that it will allow state-owned energy giant Saudi Aramco to list on the domestic stock market. According to sources, the company will announce plans for an initial public offering on the 10th, and the market is expected to start trading in mid-December. This is probably the world's largest initial public offering (IPO).
The deal may give Ami a valuation of $1.7 trillion, also known as Shah King Mohammed. Mohammed bin Salman is at the heart of the plan to transform the economy and get rid of the country's long-term dependence on oil.
Agence France-Presse quoted sources familiar with the offering plan to report that Aramco is expected to sell a total of 5% of its shares in two transactions, and for the first time in December, the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange (Tadawul) will release 2% of its shares. Next year, listing on the overseas exchange will release 3% of the stock, and no location has been selected yet.
The outside world originally expected Ami to launch the first part of the two-stage public offering in October, but the procedure was postponed. It was reported that the Crown Prince was not satisfied with the company's valuation less than expected of 2 trillion US dollars.
Aramco said that net income in the first nine months of this year reached $68 billion, and revenues and other revenues related to sales totaled $244 billion. Net income last year reached $111 billion, not only twice that of Apple, but several times that of Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.
The New York Times described this as perhaps the largest IPO in history, and is expected to break the record set by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in listing in New York in 2014.
