康生是鬼不是人 生前糜爛生活曝光

03 Nov 2019, 09:39

陳雲曾說過「康生是鬼不是人」，他對黨內異己的直接和間接的迫害，可謂空前絕後。（網路）
陳雲曾說過「康生是鬼不是人」。康生，這個從延安整風到「文革」，一直在中國政壇呼風喚雨的風雲人物，被西方人定義為「狡詐的，無道德良知的機會主義者」。其實，國內知情者更喜歡稱其為「閻羅王」，他曾用逼供信等手段，迫害致死很多人。康生是一個極端陰險毒辣的政治騙子。他對黨內異己的直接和間接的迫害，可謂空前絕後。……

第一宗罪：貪婪掠奪

康生在收藏書畫方面的愛好，幾近於一種瘋狂的掠奪。在「文革」以前，康生常以打借條的方式佔有一些文物。1956年，故宮博物館太和殿展出一方唐代陶龜硯，康生看中了，說是「借」去看看，結果是久借不還，故宮博物館不好入賬，只好為他為調撥手續，歸康生所有了。
「文革」中，康生更是想盡辦法掠奪文物。1969年10月18日上午，康生得知京城有名的文物收藏家傅惜華的書被「抄」出，並已經集中到國子監藏書庫，趕緊驅車前往到了又臟又冷的書庫，他一屁股坐在一個破木箱上動手挑書。71歲的老頭子，嘴唇發紫了，鼻涕也流出來了，一個人挑了3個多小時。就這樣，傅惜華的藏書經過紅衛兵「抄家」行動，流入康生之手。
自1968年至1972年，康生先後到北京市文管處32次，竊取圖書12,080冊，竊取文物1,102件。其中有大批宋元版和明版的珍本、孤本圖書，有2,000多年前的青銅器，有1,000年前的古硯、碑帖、書畫和印章，還有30萬年前的玳瑁化石等，都是具有重要歷史價值和藝術價值的珍品，有的還是絕無僅有的國寶。

第二宗罪：害人成性

1947年，康生在山西省林縣主管土地改革時，施行的殘酷政策，幾乎殺掉了每一個地主和富農，使許多共產黨幹部對他產生憎惡。
康生髮明的眾多酷刑中包括：把囚犯拴在馬後，然後，鞭打那匹馬，驅使他拖著受害者不停地奔跑，直到把他拖死；把醋灌進受害者的喉嚨；用一根馬尾刺進受害者的陰莖。當康生對他的施虐狂隊伍的「努力」不滿意的時候，他會不斷發明使不幸者更加痛苦的新方法。他曾威脅要把毒蛇扔進囚犯的牢房來加快獲取「供詞」。當需要恐怖的戲劇性表演時，他會極其高興地捏住囚犯們的鼻子，像牽著牛一樣領他們穿過巷。
康生害人成性，喜歡整人，其「迫害欲」在「文革」中表現得淋漓盡致。他的迫害大體分為兩類：
第一類，根據政治氣候的變化來整人。「文革」前的中央宣傳部副部長、國際問題專家姚臻，從1960年開始就在康生領導下的寫作班子里工作，勤勤懇懇，同康生朝夕相處，做了大量工作。「文革」開始後，有人貼了姚臻幾張大字報，康生立即把姚臻拋了出來，並污衊姚臻是彭真專門派來監視他的特務。姚臻當天晚上就含冤自殺了。
1968年，康生和江青一起指揮「劉少奇、王光美專案組」大搞刑訊逼供，製作偽證，誣陷劉少奇、王光美是「叛徒」、「特務」。1968年9月17日，康生在寫給江青的信中，給劉少奇戴上「大叛徒、大內奸、大工賊、大賣國賊、大漢奸」等大帽子。
第二類是那些知道康生底細的老幹部。康生心胸狹窄，生性多疑。他總怕那些知道自己底細的人有朝一日會向毛澤東告他的狀，揭發他干過的壞事，
據資料記載，「文革」初期，正當紅衛生兵到處「揪叛徒」時，康生的小姨子蘇枚突然服用安眠藥自殺。康生等人硬說這是「反革命謀殺」，責令公安部門和政法幹校追查謀殺的凶手。他指使謝富治等人，以「謀殺蘇枚的嫌疑」和「炮打無產階級司令部」的罪名將該校副校長石磊等7人拘捕起來。另外，50多人被隔離審查和受到批鬥，其中逼死1人，逼瘋4人。

第三宗罪：生活糜爛

1960年，中國人大都忍飢挨餓，苦度時日。康生卻是少數利用職權盡情享樂的人物之一，他非常溺愛他的北京種愛犬，這是過去專為皇室預備的。豢養寵物並不是康生惟一的宮廷生活樂趣，他還雇了一名宮廷廚師，享受皇帝的飲食待遇。
康生愛抽大煙，這是一名提供材料者在上世紀50年代初期發現的，當時她去探望在北京醫院裡養病的康生。她發現他帶著全套吸食鴉片的工具：煙槍、煙燈，用來在火苗上燒煙泡的細針和小匙。康生利用權勢地位保持他的吸毒癖，儘管那時候政府正在無情地處決任何進行毒品交易的人。
康生還曾把演員找到家裡，表演模仿男女的床上戲，並用當時十分罕見的錄音機給錄製下來。此外，還把京劇演員找到家，叫他們演很黃很暴力的劇目，並親自拉京胡伴奏。他還喜歡收集春宮畫，看得樂不可支。
在公開場合，他卻更喜歡把自己打扮成高深莫測的知識份子模樣。「文革」時期，他更是力求站在毛澤東身邊時舉止溫和，使自己看上去更像書生，而非閻王。
1975年，康生在氣息奄奄之際，還在毛澤東面前告了鄧小平一狀，足見其人之陰險。同年12月，康生病死。

Kang Sheng is a ghost is not a person

03 Nov 2019, 09:39

Chen Yun once said that ""Kangsheng is a ghost is not a human being."" His direct and indirect persecution of the party's dissidents is unprecedented. (network)
Chen Yun once said that ""Kangsheng is a ghost is not a person."" Kang Sheng, the man who has been in the political circle of China since the Yanan rectification to the ""Cultural Revolution"", has been defined by Westerners as ""a cunning, opportunistic opportunist."" In fact, domestic insiders prefer to call it ""King Luo"". He used persecution and other means to persecute many people. Kang Sheng is an extremely sinister and sinister political swindler. His direct and indirect persecution of dissidents within the party is unprecedented. ......

The first sin: greed and plunder

Kang Sheng's hobby in collecting calligraphy and painting is almost a kind of crazy plunder. Before the ""Cultural Revolution"", Kang Sheng often occupied some cultural relics by means of borrowing. In 1956, the Palace Museum of the Taihe Hall exhibited a Tang Dynasty pottery turtle. Kang Sheng took a fancy and said that it was a ""borrowing"" to see. The result was that it was not repaid for a long time. The Palace Museum was not well accounted for, so he had to transfer the procedures for him. Kang Sheng is all there.
In the ""Cultural Revolution"", Kang Sheng was trying to plunder the cultural relics. On the morning of October 18, 1969, Kang Sheng learned that the book of Fu Xihua, a well-known cultural relic collector in Beijing, was ""copied"" and had been concentrated in the library of the Guozijian Library. He quickly drove to the dirty and cold library, and he sat down. Pick a book on a broken wooden box. The 71-year-old man had purple lips and his nose was flowing out. He had been picking it for more than three hours. In this way, Fu Xihua's collection of books passed the action of the Red Guards' ""copying home"" and flowed into the hands of Kang Sheng.
From 1968 to 1972, Kang Sheng went to the Beijing Municipal Administration Office 32 times, stealing 12,080 books and stealing 1,102 cultural relics. Among them are a large number of rare and rare books in the Song and Yuan Dynasties, bronze books with more than 2,000 years ago, ancient plaques, rubbings, paintings and seals 1,000 years ago, and fossils of the scorpion 300,000 years ago. Treasures of historical value and artistic value, some are unique national treasures.

The second sin: harming human nature

In 1947, when Kang Sheng was in charge of land reform in Lin County, Shanxi Province, the cruel policy was implemented, almost killing every landlord and rich peasant, and causing many Communist Party cadres to hate him.
Among the many tortures that Kang Sheng invented were: squatting the prisoner behind the horse, then whipping the horse, driving him to drag the victim to keep running until he was dragged to death; vinegar was poured into the victim’s throat; A pony tail stabbed into the victim's penis. When Kang Sheng was dissatisfied with the ""effort"" of his sadistic team, he would continue to invent new ways to make the unfortunate more painful. He had threatened to throw the snake into the prisoner's cell to speed up the acquisition of ""confessions."" When a horrific dramatic performance is needed, he will be extremely happy to pinch the prisoners' noses and lead them through the lane like a cow.
Kang Sheng is a man of nature and likes the whole person. His ""persecution desire"" is vividly expressed in the ""Cultural Revolution"". His persecution is roughly divided into two categories:
In the first category, people are based on changes in the political climate. Yao Min, deputy director of the Central Propaganda Department and an expert on international issues before the Cultural Revolution, has been working in the writing team under the leadership of Kang Sheng since 1960. He has worked diligently and lived with Kang Sheng and has done a lot of work. After the ""Cultural Revolution"" began, some people posted Yao Yao's several large-character posters. Kang Sheng immediately threw out Yao Yao and slandered Yao Wei, who was sent by Peng Zhen to monitor his spies. Yao Wei committed suicide on the night.
In 1968, Kang Sheng and Jiang Qing together commanded ""Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangmei's task force"" to engage in torture and confessions, and produced perjury. Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangmei were ""traitors"" and ""special agents."" On September 17, 1968, in a letter to Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng gave Liu Shaoqi a big hat of ""great traitors, big traitors, big thieves, big traitors, big traitors"".
The second category is the old cadres who know the details of Kang Sheng. Kang Sheng has a narrow heart and is suspicious. He is always afraid that those who know their own details will one day sue him to Mao Zedong and expose the bad things he has done.
According to the records, in the early days of the ""Cultural Revolution"", when the health guards were everywhere ""smugglers"", Su Sheng, a young nephew of Kang Sheng, suddenly committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Kang Sheng and others insisted that this was a ""counterrevolutionary murder"" and ordered the public security departments and political and legal schools to trace the murderers. He instructed Xie Fuzhi and others to arrest seven people including Shi Lei, vice president of the school, on charges of ""murdering Su Mi's suspicion"" and ""cannoning the proletarian headquarters."" In addition, more than 50 people were quarantined and punished, of which one was forced to die and four were forced to go crazy.

The third sin: life is gorgeous

In 1960, the Chinese people were hungry and bitter. Kang Sheng is one of the few people who use his power to enjoy himself. He loves his Beijing breed dog very much. This was originally prepared for the royal family. Keeping pets is not the only court life of Kang Sheng. He also hired a court chef to enjoy the emperor's diet.
Kang Sheng loves to smoke, this is a material found in the early 1950s, when she went to visit Kang Sheng who was sick in Beijing hospital. She found that he was carrying a full set of opium-absorbing tools: a smoker, a smoke lamp, a fine needle and a spoon for burning cigarettes on the flame. Kang Sheng used his power to maintain his drug abuse, even though the government was ruthlessly executing anyone who was involved in the drug trade.
Kang Sheng also found the actor to the house, performing a bed show that mimicked men and women, and recorded it with a recorder that was rare at the time. In addition, the Peking Opera actor was found to be home, and they were asked to play a very violent repertoire, and personally accompaniment. He also likes to collect the erotic paintings, which is not fun.
In public, he prefers to dress himself up as an inscrutable intellectual. During the ""Cultural Revolution"" period, he even tried to stand gentle when he stood next to Mao Zedong, making himself look more like a scholar than a king.
In 1975, when Kang Sheng was in a breath, he also told Deng Xiaoping before Mao Zedong that he could see the insidiousness of his people. In December of the same year, Kang Sheng died of illness.
