      <h1>Everton vs Tottenham odds: Best bets for Sunday's Premier League and Championship games</h1>
      <h2>Expert betting tips for Goodison Park clash plus Leicester's trip to Crystal Palace and Preston North End at Charlton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T09:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Hankin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/alex-hankin/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane’s rising like a lion after slumber - back him to roar again at Goodison.</p>
      <p>The England ace’s re-emergance after injury blight continues – and Kane has scored EIGHT goals in his last four run outs against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> (4.30pm).</p>
      <p>Ignore the Carabao Cup – many do – and Everton are W3 D1 L6 this season. I make them about five points ‘down’, given the fixture list.</p>
      <p>A disappointing tally for boss Marco Silva, who got to renegotiate Everton’s squad this summer, shuffling several hundred million pounds worth of livestock in and out.</p>
      <p>Somehow it’s brought home an even worse deal than he started with.</p>
      <p>Still, a No.10 source reports that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> rates Silva as “the greatest Mexican soccerballer of all time”, so, you know, early days.</p>
      <p>While we wait, punt <b>Kane ‘anytime’ at 6/5 (Unibet, 888sport)</b> – a small price but big on his stats – and nibble the general <b>11/2 that he ‘scores two or more’.</b></p>
      <p>Roy Hodgson could order his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> lads to “park the charabanc” when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> roll up (2pm).</p>
      <p>Palace now employ youth liason workers in the dressing room to translate some of the wise old owl’s pre-decimilisation patter.</p>
      <p>They strip out all his references to Flanagan and Allen, thre’penny bits and going for tongue sandwich at the Lyons Cornerhouse.</p>
      <p>Longshot king <b>James Maddison</b> can be the Foxes’ winkle pin - he’s flying right now, and the <b>4/1 ‘anytime scorer’</b> is good value, even in old money.</p>
      <p>In the Championship, Charlton can use their heads to upset high-flying Preston North End at lunchtime (12pm).</p>
      <p>The Addicks’ discipline stats are in keeping with a blood-and-guts style, but their promotion triumph last season was defined by cool, shrewd set-piece analysis.</p>
      <p>Dead-ball scenarios are a Preston weak spot too, so big nuisance <b>Naby Sarr is a likeable longshot poke at the general 14/1 ‘anytime scorer’.</b></p>
