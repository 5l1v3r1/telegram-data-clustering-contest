Facebook承受政治壓力 反映美科技公司有被拆骨風險｜林子俊

Facebook（美股代號：FB）創辦人朱克伯格日前出席美國國會聽證會時表示，由於來自立法監管機構的阻力愈來愈大，最初支持Libra項目的伙伴亦出現退縮，故願意把原本明年發行Libra的計劃推遲，Facebook股價應聲下挫。

筆者之前曾在本欄談及，Facebook將主導發行虛擬貨幣Libra，假如成事，將會是目前公信力最大的虛擬貨幣發行平台。事實上，Facebook聰明地沒有選擇「獨食」，而是聯合了眾多合作夥伴一起推行。尤其是兩大信用卡機構Visa（美股代號：V）和Mastercard（美股代號：MA）的加盟，令到項目大有可為，消息出台後Facebook股價一路走高，反映了投資市場的看好。
Facebook承受政治壓力
先來歸納一下朱克伯格在聽證會上發言的重點，主要有四點：
一）Facebook創立Libra的目的，在於服務全球超過10億（包括1,400萬美國人）因為各種原因無法使用銀行服務的用戶，可以便捷地使用支付等功能；
二）在得到美國監管機構批準前，Facebook承諾不會在美國以外的任何一個國家發行Libra，並且主要由美元支持；換言之，Libra假如成功發行，將會進一步加強美國的金融地位；
三）國會擔心Facebook或會獲取Libra的數據，從而使其廣告業務獲利，例如針對性投放信貸廣告和消費廣告等，更甚者會根據消費者數據「歧視」性服務用戶；朱克伯格承諾不會出售數據，不會使用數據做信貸報告，不會和第三方共享數據以及不會將支付信息和廣告目的捆綁；
四）在得到監管機構批準之前，Libra不會使用Facebook作推廣，朱克伯格認同推遲虛擬貨幣發行。

較上一次聽證會進步的是，朱克伯格放棄用大量的專業術語向國會議員解釋其系統有多麼完善，而是把系統上線後的結果，利用承諾方式向國會解釋。與此同時，其似乎並不著急於推出Libra，當然這很大程度建立在Facebook強勁的現金流和穩定的業務底氣上。由于Libra的前景未明，假設投資者不再把Libra作為Facebook未來盈利的必定因素，而是作為「驚喜」，似乎對目前的估值沒有太大的影響，畢竟之前的升幅並不算太過分。
目前令Facebook最頭痛的，是美國47個州將會對科技公司進行反壟斷調查，而Facebook被視為頭號目標。是次調查由紐約州發起，而針對Facebook的指控包括公司利用用戶大數據降低消費者選擇的質量並抬高廣告價格；以及公司使用誇大後的指標來說服營銷人員，讓其他公司的營銷人員相信Facebook是大量視頻的消費方，造成欺詐行為等。事實上，美國有不少政客對大型科技公司抱敵意態度，尤其是民主黨的總統競選候選人Elizabeth Warren建議對Facebook，蘋果公司（美股代號：AAPL）、亞馬遜（美股代號：AMZN）和谷歌等進行分拆。筆者擔心的是，美國的十年牛市很大程度上是由大型科技公司市值上升所帶動，假如真的要分拆，很可能會引發環球股票市場的大震盪。

Facebook is under political pressure, reflecting that US technology companies have the risk of being dismantled | Lin Zijun
03 Nov 2019, 09:00 by Investment
Facebook (US stock code: FB) founder Zuckerberg said at a US Congressional hearing that the resistance from the legislative regulators has grown, and the partners who initially supported the Libra project have also retreated, so they are willing to release Libra originally. The plan was postponed and Facebook's share price fell.

I have previously discussed in this column, Facebook will lead the release of virtual currency Libra, if it is a success, it will be the most credible virtual currency distribution platform. In fact, Facebook smartly did not choose to ""single food"", but joined forces with many partners to implement. In particular, the joining of the two major credit card agencies Visa (US stock code: V) and Mastercard (US stock code: MA) made the project very promising. After the news came out, Facebook's stock price went up, reflecting the optimistic investment market.
Facebook is under political pressure
Let's first summarize the main points of Zhu Kebei's speech at the hearing. There are four main points:
a) Facebook's purpose in creating Libra is to serve more than one billion people worldwide (including 14 million Americans) who are unable to use banking services for various reasons, and can easily use functions such as payment;
b) Prior to being approved by US regulators, Facebook promised not to issue Libra in any country outside the United States, and it was mainly supported by the US dollar; in other words, if Libra was successfully issued, it would further strengthen the US financial position;
c) Congress is concerned that Facebook may obtain Libra's data, thereby making its advertising business profitable, such as targeted credit advertising and consumer advertising, and even more will serve users based on consumer data ""discrimination""; Zuckerberg promises not Will sell data, will not use the data for credit reporting, will not share data with third parties and will not bundle payment information and advertising purposes;
d) Libra will not use Facebook for promotion until approved by the regulator, and Zuckerberg agrees to postpone the issuance of virtual currency.

What progressed from the previous hearing was that Zuckerberg gave up explaining in a lot of technical terms to the MPs how perfect their system was, but to explain the results of the system's launch to the Congress using a commitment. At the same time, it does not seem to be eager to launch Libra, which is largely based on Facebook's strong cash flow and stable business climate. Since Libra's prospects are unclear, it is assumed that investors will no longer use Libra as a necessary factor for Facebook's future earnings, but as a ""surprise"". It seems that it does not have much impact on the current valuation. After all, the previous increase is not too much.
The biggest headache for Facebook is that 47 states in the United States will conduct antitrust investigations on technology companies, and Facebook is considered the number one target. The survey was initiated by the State of New York, and allegations against Facebook include the company's use of user big data to reduce the quality of consumer choices and raise advertising prices; and the company uses exaggerated metrics to convince marketers to convince other company's marketers Facebook is a consumer of a large number of videos, causing fraud and so on. In fact, many politicians in the United States are hostile to large technology companies, especially the Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren suggested to Facebook, Apple (US stock code: AAPL), Amazon (US stock code: AMZN) and Google, etc. Perform a spin-off. The author is worried that the ten-year bull market in the United States is largely driven by the rise in the market value of large technology companies. If it is really to be split, it is likely to trigger a big shock in the global stock market.
