      <h1>Bank of England set to slash growth outlook as rates held firm</h1>

      <p>The Bank of England is set to keep interest rates on hold at 0.75% on Thursday, but downgrade Britain’s economic outlook as prolonged Brexit uncertainty takes its toll on growth.</p>
      <p>The noon rates decision will be accompanied by the Bank’s latest set of forecasts – now renamed the Monetary Policy Report – which are expected to slash its 2020 growth outlook from the 1.3% previously pencilled in.</p>
      <p>Economists believe it may also cut the ambitious 2.3% growth forecast for 2021, given signs of strain in the UK economy amid political wrangling and Brexit uncertainty, with the withdrawal deadline pushed back again to January 31.</p>
      <blockquote>We are dubious that the Bank of England will cut interest rates unless the UK economy takes a major downward lurch</blockquote>
      <p>The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) warned in its last rates decision over the damage being inflicted by “entrenched” Brexit uncertainty.</p>
      <p>It also hinted at the possibility that rates may need to be cut if Brexit is delayed again – and since then two MPC members have voiced support for the case for a rate reduction in such circumstances.</p>
      <p>But the looming snap General Election in the UK on December 12, together with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s move to secure a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, is seen staying the Bank’s hand.</p>
      <p>This comes despite its counterparts in Europe and America recently moving to reduce rates in the face of slowing global growth.</p>
      <p>Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said it would be “extremely unusual” for the Bank to change monetary policy in the run-up to a general election.</p>
      <p>He is pencilling in a unanimous vote among the nine-strong MPC, though he added there could potentially be some dissent from one or more members.</p>
      <p>Before the latest Brexit extension, policymakers Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders both said rate cuts would likely be needed to support the economy if Brexit was delayed again.</p>
      <p>In a sign of a potential rift on the MPC, Bank deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said be believed the UK’s slower “speed limit” for growth would weaken the case for lower rates.</p>

      <p>Mr Archer said there is a “very real chance” rates will be cut in 2020 even if a deal is now struck by January 31, although he believes it is more likely they will be held at 0.75% through to 2021.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are dubious that the Bank of England will cut interest rates unless the UK economy takes a major downward lurch given a still relatively tight labour market, the fact that fiscal policy is likely to be looser and a belief that the economy will gradually pick-up following a UK exit from the EU with a deal.”</p>
      <p>Steady and below-target inflation – which remained at near three-year lows of 1.7% in September – also helps ease any pressure on the Bank to raise rates.</p>
      <p>This all comes as recent economic indicators have suggested all sectors of the economy are suffering amid the Brexit indecision, particularly in August and September.</p>
      <p>But a more buoyant July performance is set to see the UK avoid a technical recession, with third-quarter growth bouncing back to 0.4% from the 0.2% contraction in the previous three months.</p>
