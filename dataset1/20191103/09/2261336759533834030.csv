What was the high point of the fight?

Both men started the fight very patient on the feet, showing great respect for each other’s striking abilities. Gastelum tried to find success in the clinch but Till did well to break free and attack the lead leg of Gastelum with some heavy leg kicks.
Other than an eye poke from Gastelum briefly halting the action, the second round was much the same with Till turning the fight in his favour by continuing to chop down Gastelum’s front leg. Gastelum did better in the third round taking Till down for a moment, but the Liverpudlian got up and the two continued their chess match on the feet.

Where do these two go from here?

The loss for Gastelum means he is now a two-fight losing skid, previously dropping a unanimous decision to Israel Adesanya earlier this year. Never really finding his groove in the fight, Gastelum will probably drop in the middleweight rankings after the loss, maybe a fight against Jared Cannonier, who was a backup for this fight at UFC 244, is a good one to make next.
Many doubted Till when this matchup was announced, given it was his debut at 185-pounds and the 26-year-old was on a two-fight losing streak coming into UFC 244. It’s hard to know who’s next for Till given Gastelum was ranked fourth at middleweight before their fight, but it’s fair to say Till is right in the mix at 185-pounds.

Watch it now, later or never?

Never. Not much happened in the fight, so you’re not missing anything.
