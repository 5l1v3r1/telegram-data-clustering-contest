      <p>STUART, Fla. (AP) — After vowing to go on following a fatal plane crash days earlier, organizers of a Florida air show are canceling the event because of weather.</p>
      <p>Organizers of the Audi Stuart Air Show on Sunday tweeted that they were canceling the show out of safety concerns due to continuing rain.</p>
      <p>One of the planned participants was killed Friday while preparing for the show.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Dr. Joseph Masessa was running a practice routine when the plane went nose down into the runway. The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.</p>
      <p>Organizers of the air show described Masessa as a beloved performer, and Sunday’s show was being dedicated to him and another aviator.</p>
      <p>Bad weather also forced air show events to be canceled on Saturday.</p>
