      <blockquote>The move comes a day after Reuters cited unnamed sources as saying that “Crown Prince [Mohammed bin Salman] finally gave the green light” to Aramco’s IPO.</blockquote>
      <p>Plans for the decision were first announced in 2016 as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 economic overhaul programme but have been delayed a number of times.</p>
      <p>Riyadh reportedly expects the IPO to value the oil giant at some $2 trillion, the largest such valuation in history, which would allow the company to raise as much as $100 billion by listing just a 5 percent stake.</p>

Riyadh blamed the incident on Iran, which for its part denied allegations.</p>
