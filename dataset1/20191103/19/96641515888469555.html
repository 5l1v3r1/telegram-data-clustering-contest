      <h1>The first in-the-wild BlueKeep cyberattack isn't as dangerous as feared</h1>

      <p>When word broke of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/17/us-recommends-windows-users-patch-against-worm-vulnerability/">BlueKeep vulnerability</a> in Windows, many feared a repeat of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/16/white-house-blames-russia-for-notpetya/">NotPetya</a> and other widespread worms that have wreaked havoc. They might not have to worry <i>quite</i> so much, though. Kryptos Logic has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/16/white-house-blames-russia-for-notpetya/">discovered</a> the first known in-the-wild BlueKeep exploit, and it isn't as vicious as feared. The initial attack from a "low-level actor" appears to have scanned the internet and infected vulnerable systems with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/02/police-commandeer-malware-botnet/">cryptocurrency miner</a>, but little else. There are no data wipes, no automatic spreading or other signs of a worm in action.</p>
      <p>There's been a "spike" in traffic related to the flaw, Rendition Infosec's Jake Williams <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluekeep-hacking-cryptocurrency-mining/">told</a> <i>Wired</i>, but it hasn't hit "critical mass."</p>
      <p>This doesn't rule out the possibility of a more serious BlueKeep attack. There were still 735,000 computers open to BlueKeep as of August, according to Errata Security. However, the window of opportunity for a large-scale attack is closing. The longer it takes for someone to develop a large-scale attack, the more people patch their PCs against it. This may be one of those precious instances where a potentially serious vulnerability fizzles out due to both slow-to-move hackers and, importantly, an effective campaign to patch people's computers.</p>
