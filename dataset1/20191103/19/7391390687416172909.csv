The 13 Softest Bath Towels

03 Nov 2019, 19:00

No one likes to get out of a warm, relaxing shower only to grab a towel that feels like sandpaper. In fact, that's one of the best parts of staying at a hotel — you pretty much know the towels are going to be as soft as butter. But here's the thing: You don't have to go on vacation for that level of luxury. You can actually buy the softest bath towels out there and use them anytime you want.
Do one quick search and you'll come away with thousands of options for bath towels. And sure, the images all look ultra fluffy and soft, but the key is truly in the fabric. Before you invest in a new set of bath towels, be sure to look for luxe fabrics like Turkish cotton or breathable bamboo. Or if you're in the market for a lightweight option, there are also microfiber bath towels that dry quickly and still feel like a dream.
You'll also want to keep your personal preferences in mind. For example, if you're anything like me, you like to be literally swallowed up in your bath towels. There are a ton of great oversized bath towels that can do the trick. If you plan to take your towels with you to the gym or when you're traveling, you may want a more compact, textured option that wicks moisture quickly.
When it comes down to it, there are so many choices that it's not always easy to find the perfect bath towel for you. Here's a round-up of some of the comfiest options on the market to help you get started.
1. A Soft Towel Set Made Of Bamboo & Turkish Cotton




Chakir Turkish Linens Luxury Towels (Set Of 4)$45|AmazonSee On Amazon

These bamboo towels are super soft and naturally anti-fungal, to keep your towels from smelling or growing mold. They're also woven with Turkish cotton for extra softness, and reviewers say these towels only get softer with each wash. Plus, with the double-stitched hem, you never have to worry about them unraveling after all those washes. You can get this set of four in one of eight colors, including a classic white towel.
What fans say: ""They are definitely the softest towels I have ever used. I believe they are 65% cotton and 35% bamboo. Wish Amazon carried more towels with this fiber content—it would be the only towels I would own!!""
2. Plush Towels That Are Just As Soft As The Ones In A Hotel

You don't have to check into a hotel for the luxe experience these plush bath towels offer. They're made from 100% Turkish cotton that makes them feel heavenly against your skin. These towels are also heavier weight than most luxury towels, so you truly feel like you're being wrapped in a blanket each time you get out of the shower. And since they're made with such high-quality fabrics, you can also pretty much guarantee that they'll never get coarse over time.
What fans say: ""These are easily the best towels I’ve ever bought. They are thick and durable, as well as super soft! I highly recommend buying these!""
3. Spa-Grade Towels That Feel Like A Dream

Even better, they're made without any toxic chemicals or dyes that tend to bleed in the wash. Reviewers insist that these towels continue to look like new, even after months of use and washing.
What fans say: ""I must say these are the best towels I have ever owned. They washed and dried great the first time without lots of lint like other towels I have owned in the past.

4. Soft Oversized Towels With Thousands Of Fans

I never thought I'd wax poetically about a towel, but then again, I hadn't encountered this towel.""
5. A Set Of Two Soft Towels That's Quick Dry

What fans say: ""Was pleasantly surprised with these at this price. Super soft, extremely absorbent. After the first wash they soften up so much they feel a bit like microfiber cloths.
