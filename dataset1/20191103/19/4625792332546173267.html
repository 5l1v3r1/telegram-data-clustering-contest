      <h1>Trump says he told Fox to get a new pollster amid network's 'lousy' polls on support for impeachment</h1>

      <p>President Trump called Fox News pollsters “lousy” and suggested the network find better people to run their presidential polling amid data showing nearly half of American voters support impeachment.</p>
      <p>During a gaggle on Sunday, Trump was asked if he is confident that he will win reelection in 2020 despite the impeachment proceedings that are underway. He claimed that his internal polling was strong.</p>
      <p>“I’m very confident,” Trump said. “Our poll numbers are great. We’re doing very well in the polls.”</p>
      <p>Trump noted that internal impeachment polls have been “very strong” in favor of keeping him in office despite several recent polls showing the country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/americans-sharply-divided-over-whether-to-impeach-and-remove-trump-from-office-post-abc-poll-finds/2019/10/31/b0562312-fc04-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html"><u>split</u></a> evenly about impeachment.</p>
      <p>“You’re reading the wrong polls,” Trump said after being asked about the divide. “Let me tell you. I have the real polls.”</p>
      <p>The president claimed polls from CNN were “fake” and continued to question Fox News as well.</p>
      <p>“The Fox polls have always been lousy,” he said. “I tell them they ought to get themselves a new pollster.”</p>

      <p>He later added, “People don’t want anything to do with impeachment. It’s a phony scam.”</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-whoever-fox-news-pollster-is-they-suck"><u>condemned Fox’s polling before</u></a>, saying they “suck.”</p>

      <p>A Fox News poll <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-49-percent-favor-impeaching-trump"><u>released</u></a> Sunday morning showed that support for Trump’s impeachment and removal from office is at 49%, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fox-news-poll-just-more-than-half-of-voters-want-trump-impeached-and-removed-from-office">down from 51%</a> in early October.</p>
