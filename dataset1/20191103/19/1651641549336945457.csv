That cheaper Samsung Galaxy S10 might look like this
03 Nov 2019, 19:02 by Raka
We’ve earlier reported that Samsung is considering bringing a “Lite” version of its Note and S series to the market. While we didn’t get to know much about the specs, according to previous rumors, the cheaper Galaxy S10 smartphone with model number SM-G770F and the upcoming Galaxy A91 are going to share a lot of similarities in terms of specifications.
Now the good news is we now know what the upcoming cheaper Galaxy S could like, thanks to the latest patent that’s filed Samsung and published by USPTO. The Samsung patent is of a device that looks very similar to the design aesthetic of the current Galaxy S10 smartphone and hence, it’s easier to draw a conclusion that the patent is for the cheaper Galaxy S10 Lite smartphone. That said, whether Samsung will officially call it Galaxy S10 Lite or something else is unknown.



Aside from the look of the smartphone, we also know about what’s inside the smartphone. The cheaper Galaxy S10 model could feature a 6.7-inch FHD + Infinity-O display and the Snapdragon 855 is what the smartphone is going to depend on for its processing power. The smartphone is also rumored to be coming with a huge 8GB of RAM and powering the smartphone will be a 45oomAh battery.
