The MTV EMAs kicked off in style tonight, with Dua Lipa leading the red carpet arrivals at the glitzy event in Seville, Spain.
Dressed in a sheer black midi-dress, the New Rules singer, 24, flashed her bra as she posed for snaps alongside a host of famous faces from the world of music.
Her kooky number was slit to the thigh, allowing her to flash her stockings and metallic black boots.
Dua also wore a black corset style waist belt over the dress, drawing attention to her slim frame.
Her blonde locks were worn in a slick backed style and she sported a pair of dangling diamond earrings.
