BREAKING: Vettel retires from United States Grand Prix with suspension failure!
03 Nov 2019, 19:30 by Nicolás Quarles van Ufford

Ferrari star Sebastian Vettel has retired from the United States Grand Prix, with the suspension of the German's SF90 suddenly breaking on the rear right as he came out of turn nine at the Circuit of the Americas.

A sudden snap put Vettel on three wheels and immediately ended his race, with the four-time champion having already dropped from second place on the grid to seventh.
His car was already understeering heavily until it finally gave the ghost. Will the very bumpy COTA have been the reason for the 32-year-old's car breaking down in such a sudden way?
