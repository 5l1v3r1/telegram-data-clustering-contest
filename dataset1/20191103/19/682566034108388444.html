      <p>New York - Kenya's <b>Joyciline Jepkosgei</b> ended <b>Mary Keitany's</b> <b>New York Marathon</b> reign on Sunday, powering to victory in her first ever outing over the distance.</p>
      <p>Jepkosgei produced a superb tactical race, pulling away from defending champion Keitany in the final few miles to take the tape with an unofficial time of 2:22:38.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Jepkosgei had never run a competitive marathon before while compatriot Keitany had been gunning for her fifth New York title.</p>
      <p>The two women had been part of a three-pronged breakaway that led from around the 12-mile mark alongside Ethiopia's Ruti Aga.</p>
      <p>That trio remained out in front as they advanced into Manhattan at mile 16, although Keitany gave the first clue she was struggling after appearing to vomit.</p>
      <p>Keitany and Jepkosgei started edging away from Aga by mile 20 and soon the Ethiopian had been dropped from contention.</p>
      <p>Jepkosgei then made her move in mile 23, rapidly putting daylight between herself and Keitany and opening up a 16-second lead heading down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Heading into the final mile Jepkosgei grimaced as she dug in for victory, glancing over her shoulder to check the presence of Keitany.</p>
      <p>Keitany looked comfortable but by that stage had left herself too much work to do and Jepkosgei closed out a superb win, just missing out on Margaret Okayo's 2003 course record of 2:22:31.</p>
      <p>South Africa's Gerda Steyn finished in a time of 2:27:48.</p>
