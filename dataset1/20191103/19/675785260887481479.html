      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing-line-up">Strictly Come Dancing</a> has always loved a bit of glitz and glam, and presenters <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tess-daly">Tess</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/claudia-winkleman">Claudia</a> are no exception.</p>
      <p>Tonight the presenting duo both stepped onto the ballroom in sparkly fashion ensembles, ahead of delivering the shocking results of week seven's dance-off.</p>
      <p>BBC dancing competition host Tess Daly looked phenomenal as she sizzled onto the Strictly Ballroom in a shimmering gun-metal grey dress.</p>
      <p>Her co-host Claudia Winkleman was also unmissable as she sparkled onto the seventh results show of the series in a deep red pleated skirt with sequin embellishments and a slinky halterneck blouse tucked in.</p>

      <p>Blonde bombshell Tess, 50, looked sensational as she shimmered onto the dancefloor in the glittering quarter-sleeved dress which featured flattering ruched detailing, floaty sleeves and a pretty waterfall hemline.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, brunette beauty Claudia, 47, changed up for look from her usual classic black outfit to a glitzy skirt.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three added glamour to her Strictly Results show look with dark eyeshadow, thick mascara and added a slick of nude gloss to her lips.</p>
      <p>While Tess tied her glossy blonde looks into a tousled up-do and accentuated her natural features with rose-tinted make-up and a glowing complexion.</p>
