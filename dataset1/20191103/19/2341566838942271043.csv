反送中蛋糕赴英參展 遭中國選手舉報撤銷資格[影]

（中央社台北3日電）近日在英國舉行的「國際蛋糕節2019」活動，一件以香港「反送中」為題的作品遭中國選手投訴，並被主辦單位撤銷參賽資格。蛋糕製作團隊表示將上訴，並強調勿用「港獨」抹殺了解的機會。
據中國參賽者陳瑤1日在微博上傳的照片顯示，這座三層蛋糕的底部，模仿「連儂牆」貼上寫有反送中口號的便利貼，中層有一塊「V怪客」面具和頭盔、雨傘，上層則是一位手持黃傘的黑衣示威者。
陳瑤在微博上表示，她和4位中國選手向主辦單位舉報了「港毒」作品，稱自己可能因此被取消參賽資格，「但那又怎樣？不論結果如何，這比比賽本身更重要！祖國利益面前，決！不！妥！協！」
她還表示，從技術水平看，這個作品恐怕不是衝著拿獎的，「更像是一個政治工具」，「利用國際賽事為恐怖暴力洗地不能忍」。
陳瑤2日又再發文指，在中國選手們團結一致共同努力下，兩個「政治敏感蛋糕」都被撤展。她提到，有人質疑她不尊重別人自由表達的權利，但她認為世上沒有絕對的自由，「建立在法律，在國家利益不受侵犯的前提之下才叫自由」。
星島日報報導，主辦單位認為蛋糕主題內容涉及冒犯成分，引來其他參賽者投訴，因此決定取消其參賽資格。
香港餐廳3rd Space則在Instagram上傳這件作品的影片，表示團隊成員製作的蛋糕遭政治DQ（取消資格，Disqualification），但仍會做回自己，將提出上訴。貼文也以簡體字強調，「不要用一頂『港獨』的帽子，去抹殺了解事情的機會」。（編輯：沈朋達/林克倫）1081103

Responding to the cake in the UK to participate in the exhibition
03 Nov 2019, 19:54 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Taipei, 3rd) Recently, a ""National Cake Festival 2019"" event held in the United Kingdom, a piece of Hong Kong ""reverse delivery"" title was complained by Chinese players and was disqualified by the organizer. The cake making team said that they would appeal and stressed that they should not use ""Hong Kong independence"" to obliterate the opportunities.
According to a photo uploaded by Chinese entrant Chen Yao on Weibo on the 1st, the bottom of the three-layered cake imitates the ""Lianyu Wall"" with a sticky note with a slogan in the reverse, and a ""V geek"" in the middle. Masks and helmets and umbrellas, the upper layer is a black demonstrator holding a yellow umbrella.
Chen Yao said on Weibo that she and four Chinese players reported the ""Hong Kong Poison"" works to the organizers, saying that they might be disqualified. ""But what about it? Regardless of the outcome, it is more important than the competition itself. ! In front of the interests of the motherland, no! Not! Proper!
She also said that from a technical perspective, this work may not be directed at winning prizes. ""It is more like a political tool."" ""Using international events to wash the land for terrorist violence cannot be tolerated.""
On the 2nd, Chen Yao issued another article saying that under the joint efforts of Chinese players, the two ""politically sensitive cakes"" were dismantled. She mentioned that some people questioned her disrespect for the right of others to express freely, but she believed that there was no absolute freedom in the world. ""It is based on the law and is called freedom under the premise that the national interest is not violated.""
The Sing Tao Daily reported that the organizers believed that the theme of the cake involved offensive elements and attracted other participants to complain, so they decided to cancel their qualifications.
Hong Kong restaurant 3rd Space uploaded a video of this work on Instagram, indicating that the cake made by the team members was politically DQ (Disqualification), but will still be back to themselves and will appeal. The post also emphasizes in simplified Chinese characters, ""Do not use a hat of ""Hong Kong independence"" to obliterate the opportunity to understand things.""
