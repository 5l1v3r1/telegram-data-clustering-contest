Strictly Come Dancing has always loved a bit of glitz and glam, and presenters Tess and Claudia are no exception.
Tonight the presenting duo both stepped onto the ballroom in sparkly fashion ensembles, ahead of delivering the shocking results of week seven's dance-off.
BBC dancing competition host Tess Daly looked phenomenal as she sizzled onto the Strictly Ballroom in a shimmering gun-metal grey dress.
Her co-host Claudia Winkleman was also unmissable as she sparkled onto the seventh results show of the series in a deep red pleated skirt with sequin embellishments and a slinky halterneck blouse tucked in.

Blonde bombshell Tess, 50, looked sensational as she shimmered onto the dancefloor in the glittering quarter-sleeved dress which featured flattering ruched detailing, floaty sleeves and a pretty waterfall hemline.
Meanwhile, brunette beauty Claudia, 47, changed up for look from her usual classic black outfit to a glitzy skirt.
The mum-of-three added glamour to her Strictly Results show look with dark eyeshadow, thick mascara and added a slick of nude gloss to her lips.
While Tess tied her glossy blonde looks into a tousled up-do and accentuated her natural features with rose-tinted make-up and a glowing complexion.

Sttunning host Tess also added a touch of sparkle to her look with a pair of dramatic hoop earrings, while Claudia kept things simple with minimal jewellery.
Both presenters added height to their fashion ensembles with stiletto heels.
Tonight's results show will reveal the next celebrity to be booted off the show and join fellow voted off stars England goalie David James, presenter Dev Griffin, TV legend Anneka Rice and Olympic Rower James Cracknell .
