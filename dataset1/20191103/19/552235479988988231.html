      <p>A family who worked out £10,000 on a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/holidays">dream Disney World holiday</a> for their severely <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/autism">disabled boys</a> were left disgusted after finding insects and a used condom in their hotel room.</p>
      <p>Michael, 35, and Paul Atwal-Brice, 41, found dead cockroaches, a used condom, exposed wiring and dirt on every fixture at the £400-a-night Caribbean Beach Resort hotel in Florida.</p>
      <p>The couple, and their two adopted twins Levi and Lucas, aged 13, were on a 'magical' trip to the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, US.</p>
      <p>Their twin boys are <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/autism">autistic</a> , asthmatic, suffer from epilepsy and don't speak.</p>

      <p>The family had called ahead and asked staff to clean and check the room for their arrival as their children will touch anything.</p>
      <p>Michael and Paul, who hit the headlines in 2018 when they adopted two sets of twins - Levi and Lucas and toddlers Lance and Lotan, were terrified about the dangers the hotel room posed.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Michael told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/disney-world-nightmare-after-cockroaches-20791306">Mirror Online</a> : "Straight away you could see the room was dirty then we saw a dead cockroach, which was quite big.</p>
      <p>"There was lots of exposed wiring. Our boys have no sense of danger, so they could easily stick their fingers in that.</p>
      <p>"There was so much crap and dust.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a holiday from hell so far. Dead cockroaches and other bugs in  the room, broken lights with exposed wires and, worst of all, a used condom on the bed.</p>
      <p>"The boys could have stood on the cockroach and could very easily have touched the condom if they dropped their bouncy ball down the side of the bed."</p>

      <p>"This holiday was supposed to be like all their presents rolled into one."</p>
      <p>With flights, the Disney Package which includes tickets to Walt Disney World and the £400-a-night hotel, in all the couple spent around £10,000.</p>
      <p>The flight took 10 hours before a two hour ride on the Magical Express bus which takes holidaymakers to the resort. </p>
      <p>After all that, the family were distraught with what they found.</p>
      <p>"That's what shocked us. We've not just booked any old hotel. We've purposefully booked this resort and spent a vast amount of money to make it all magical and special," said Michael.</p>
      <p>"It's supposed to be magical, once in a lifetime, but that was like a one-star bedsit.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"We couldn't stay in there. The boys were upset and were screaming and distressed.</p>
      <p>"It was a really bad start to the holiday."</p>
      <p>When the couple complained to front desk at the Caribbean Beach, they were moved to another room.</p>
      <p>But to make matters worse, the next room contained just as much dirt and dust - as well as centipedes moving around the place.</p>
      <p>Michael said: "It was more like I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>

      <p>Michael said Disney staff initially refused to refund any more than one night's stay but, as things escalated, senior management got involved.</p>
      <p>Now the family have been moved to Disney's lavish, bayside Grand Floridian Resort and Spa.</p>
      <p>Michael and Paul have been foster parents to more than 20 children.</p>
      <p>They appeared on the BBC programme Shop Well For Less as they tried to save up cash to go on the dream trip.</p>
      <p>They admitted to presenters Alex Jones and Steph McGovern that they regularly spent thousands on making Christmas special for their foster children.</p>
      <p>The couple also campaign for better access to cannabis-based medications on the NHS and have appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the topic.</p>
      <p>Michael is an ambassador of charity  MY AFK - formerly known as Action For Kids - and is a speaker on disability.</p>
      <p>Paul was awarded a British Citizenship Award for promoting diversity and inclusion and also mentors new LGBTQ foster carers, giving support and advice for families who may be looking after children with additional needs.</p>
      <p>A Disney spokeswoman said: "While we believe the guest claims were exaggerated, we took several steps to enhance their vacation."</p>
