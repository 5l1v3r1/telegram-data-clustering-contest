No. 12 Washington volleyball team cruises to sweep of No. 25 UCLA
03 Nov 2019, 19:39 by Seattle Times staff
No. 12 Washington earned a Pac-12 volleyball sweep against No. 25 UCLA on Sunday at Alaska Airlines Arena, 25-14, 25-14, 25-23.
Shannon Crenshaw had 10 kills and hit .474 for the Huskies (17-5, 8-4 Pac-12), on a day when all their attackers hit over .300.
“You hope it for kids sometimes, but they’ve got to do it out there, and she looked just like she looked two nights ago but even better,” UW coach Keegan Cook said about Crenshaw. “The kid puts in a lot of work before practice, after practice, she’s been hearing a lot of feedback for the last year and a half, and making changes is hard, and she’s done that. Now she’s getting the reward of that so I’m really happy for her.”
Kara Bajema added 11 kills, and Shayne McPherson had 15 digs for UW.
The win put UW into a five-way tie (along with Washington State, California, Utah and UCLA) for second place in the Pac-12, two matches behind Stanford.
There’s four weeks remaining in the regular season. UW is on the road next weekend against the Oregon schools.
More volleyball

Hockey
• Bryce Kindopp’s penalty shot in overtime, his second goal of the game, gave the Everett Silvertips a 4-3 road win against the Spokane Chiefs. Wyatte Wylie assisted on Everett’s first three goals, and Michal Gut had a goal and an assist. Jalen Price also scored for the Tips.
