You don’t realize just how convenient a smart TV is until you use one. Bonus points when it’s got a premium 50-inch screen too. This Vizio D-Series smart TV checks both boxes and it’s just $430 for a limited time.
It packs all of the crisp detail you expect in an ultra HD smart TV, with all of the convenience of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and more apps you love. The built-in Spatial Scaling Engine converts everything to ultra HD, so you’ll never want to go back to your old TV.
Enjoy the crisp detail of over 8.3 million pixels.
Everything looks better when it’s powered by 8.3 million Vizio pixels. Maybe you can even solve the mysterious Sasquatch footage once and for all. The V8 Octa-core processor will help launch your apps and power the TV on faster so you won’t miss a minute of your shows.
With four built-in HDMI ports, WiFi, and a screencast app, you can find a way to watch anything you want. Plug in your cable box, an Xbox, and a PlayStation and still have space to add more devices. Vizio’s huge screen might even help you play better in Fortnite.

Massive 50-inch screen with 4K Ultra HD resolution.
V8 Octa-core processor to speed up CPU and GPU functions.
Browse on your phone and cast it right to your TV.
