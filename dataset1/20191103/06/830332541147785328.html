      <h1>'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is getting a sequel</h1>
      <h2>Movie set to be released in April 2022</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T06:40:32+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 06:40</time> by <a rel="author">Leah Asmelash, CNN</a></address>
      <p>HOLLYWOOD, Calif. - The original "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" was a hit with both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/13/entertainment/spiderman-into-the-spiderverse-review/index.html">critics</a> and comic book fans when it was released in 2018.</p>
      <p>Now, fans of the Oscar-winning film have a little something to look forward to.</p>
      <p>The franchise announced the sequel Friday to the pure delight of fans everywhere.</p>
      <p>The new movie is set to be released on April 8, 2022. No other details have been provided.</p>
      <p>Still, the announcement is welcoming. In a saturated comic book and superhero movie era, "Spider-Verse" <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/25/entertainment/most-satisfying-movies-and-tv-list/index.html">stood out</a> for its stunning animation and energy. In a crowded 2019 Oscar field, the movie beat out hits like "Incredibles 2," "Isle of Dogs" and "Ralph Breaks the Internet" to win for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/24/entertainment/oscars-winners-2019-list/index.html">best animated feature</a>.</p>
      <p>The movie follows Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic teen who develops powers when bit by a spider (sound familiar?).</p>
      <p>But the movie doesn't go the way other introductory Spider-Man films have gone in the past. The film introduces multiple Spider-People from different dimensions â€” like Spider Gwen, Spider Ham, and of course Peter Parker.</p>
      <p>We don't want to give too much away. But, in a nutshell, they've all ended up in Morales' world through a dimensional portal and must work together to find their way back home. Did we mention they also have to save the universe? It<i> is</i> a superhero movie, after all.</p>
      <p>In 2022, it seems like they'll be gearing up for action all over again.</p>
