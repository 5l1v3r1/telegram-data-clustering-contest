鍾孟宏導演昨（2）日於光點華山舉辦《陽光普照》放映暨導演講堂，心情相當好的導演還在講堂上自曝，當年因演出《一路順風》入圍金馬獎的主持人納豆曾跟他許下承諾，未來將願意在他再婚的婚禮上免費擔任主持，以表達謝意。
榮獲本屆金馬獎11項大獎提名，口碑撼動本屆多倫多影展、東京影展與釜山影展，導演鍾孟宏第5部作品《陽光普照》，前天（1日）在台上映。導演鍾孟宏在光點華山舉辦《陽光普照》放映暨導演講堂，而「陽光兄弟」巫建和、許光漢一同也出席長春國賓、欣欣秀泰、真善美與in89豪華等戲院映後座談，兵分兩路與粉絲面對面暢談電影。

談到新戲為何沒有找自稱「金馬入圍吉祥物」的固定班底納豆合作，鍾孟宏表示片中《大佛普拉斯》阿堯導演飾演的戶政事務所證婚人原本屬意納豆，但因時間配合不上而作罷，更笑言：「如果找納豆演弟弟或哥哥，這部戲能看嗎？」導演更加碼爆料納豆因《一路順風》入圍金馬男配角，曾承諾他：「願意終生免費主持鍾孟宏任何活動，不管是女兒結婚、甚至是他再婚，來作為答謝。」讓現場爆滿觀眾一陣爆笑。但導演也偷偷透露納豆即將演出自己監製、阿堯最新作品《同學麥娜絲》納豆有參一腳。
而「陽光兄弟」巫建和、許光漢出席的欣欣秀泰影城映後座談中，現場觀眾詢問，兩人在片中的眼神戲很動人，有無特別揣摩？巫建和表示：「用直覺演戲，表現當下最好的狀態。」許光漢則表示：「現場即興碰撞出來的。」有觀眾很驚訝巫建和、許光漢兩人並非科班出身，演技卻非常出色。巫建和表示自己平時透過閱讀和觀察來揣摩， 卻被年紀稍長的觀眾反虧：「導演怎麼敢用你？」笑翻全場。
