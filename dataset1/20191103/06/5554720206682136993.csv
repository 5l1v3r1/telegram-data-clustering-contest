Among those injured are also two station house officers (SHOs) and an additional commissioner rank officer. A report by news agency PTI said that the violence was triggered by an argument between lawyers and police over parking.
News agency ANI reported that Chief Justice of Delhi High Court Justice DN Patel had taken suo moto cognisance of yesterday’s clash.
IPS officer Aslam Khan, who was the DCP (North West) in Delhi before being shifted to Goa in January this year, shared a CCTV video on Twitter and wrote, “Any opinion? This was starting point of tussle what I could guess.For how long police will be at receiving end just because they have no support and leadership.”





In the video shared by Khan, dozens of lawyers are seen pouncing on a policeman. After a minute in the video, the policeman is seen lying motionless. Replying to a user’s response, Khan said that the Delhi Police desperately needed ‘strong and honest leadership.’
Meanwhile, both parties have lodged complaints and the cases will be probed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Crime Branch, reported PTI. Several Bar Associations have called for a one-day strike in all district courts on 4 November.
