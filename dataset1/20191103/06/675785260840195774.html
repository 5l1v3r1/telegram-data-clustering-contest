      <h1>Canelo Alvarez KOs Sergey Kovalev to win light-heavyweight world title</h1>
      <h2>Canelo was bidding to win a world title at a fourth different weight against the champion Kovalev</h2>

      <p>Canelo Alvarez produced a devastating KO to beat Sergey Kovalev and win a world title in a fourth different weight division.</p>
      <p>The Mexican was jumping up from middleweight to take on the light-heavyweight champion in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>And although Kovalev made the better start, Alvarez came on strongly in the second half of the fight before delivering a sickening KO in the 11th round.</p>
      <p>The challenger, who earned a staggering Â£27million for his efforts, overcame his size disadvantage to add another belt to his collection.</p>

      <p>Kovalev attempted to use his size in the opening round as he popped out his jab, albeit to little penetrating effect.</p>
      <p>Canelo's body punching was considered a crucial weapon against the susceptible Kovalev and the Mexican looked to utilise that from the second round.</p>
      <p>But still the champion controlled proceedings with his jab, much as he did against Britain's Anthony Yarde in August.</p>
      <p>Alvarez began to land the left hook in the fourth round but he found the Russian's guard difficult to infiltrate.</p>
      <p>He did however increase his work rate as the fight reached the halfway point with the Mexican on the front foot.</p>

      <p>But if he was expected to push on into the second half of the bout, it was Kovalev who was the busier of the two as the championship rounds loomed.</p>
      <p>Kovalev was almost stopped by Yarde in the ninth round before rallying to stop the Londoner in the penultimate session.</p>
      <p>But despite the quick turnaround, he appeared fresh at the same stage against Canelo although the Mexican came on strongly in the 10th.</p>
      <p>And after he landed a left hook to the head in the penultimate round, he followed it up with a right hook which sent Kovalev through the ropes.</p>
