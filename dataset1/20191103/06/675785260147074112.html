      <h2>Dramatic pictures show the scale of the landslide in the village of Xenaxicul in Aguacatan, Guatemala</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T06:41:16+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 06:41</time> by <a rel="author">Elaine McCahill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/elaine-mccahill/</a></address>
      <p>A dad and his three children have died after their house was swallowed by a landslide.</p>
      <p>The incident took place at around 6.30am in the village of Xenaxicul in  Aguacatan, northwest Guatemala, close to the border with Mexico. </p>
      <p>According to the local authorities, heavy rainfall in the region softened the earth and caused the landslide.</p>
      <p>The catastrophic landslide started while four family members were inside the house and two were outside.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old dad, identified as Francisco Mejia Lux, and his three children, aged 10, six and three, all died in the incident.</p>
      <p>The three boys have been identified as Feliciano, Fredy Gaspar and Enzo Arael.</p>

      <p>A 16-year-old boy who was using the outhouse at the time was rescued by the emergency services, but his current condition is unknown.</p>
      <p>Reports said he had suffered multiple fractures and was taken to the National Hospital of Huehuetenango.</p>
      <p>The children’s 36-year-old mother Catarina Tum Luc was also outside grinding corn for breakfast when the house was swallowed by the landslide and is said to be in deep shock.</p>
      <p>Neighbours and local residents are helping to console the devastated mum as well as raising money for the funeral costs, according to local media.</p>
      <p>The video shared on social networks shows the moment neighbours start digging the area in order to rescue the family.</p>

      <p>On Monday, onlookers recorded the moment a huge chunk of land with houses built on it plummets down a cliff.</p>
