館長轟韓國瑜「背信忘義厚顏無恥」　以討客兄為例酸韓落跑參選
03 Nov 2019, 06:26 by 朱晉緯
館長日前直播又再度大嗆韓國瑜，提到韓國瑜在青年論壇被問到「溜之大吉」一事，卻回答「其他人也都這樣」「我沒有違法」等，和韓國瑜曾經在他節目許下的承諾完全相反，讓館長氣得狂飆三字經。館長還用「討客兄」舉例說明韓參選，批韓背信忘義、厚顏無恥，並表示這次絕對不會再被他騙。
館長提到，在韓國瑜辦的青年論壇中，有年輕人詢問關於「溜之大吉」一事，韓國瑜卻表示行政院長、某些立委、美國的歐巴馬等都曾經帶職參選，也表示自己沒有違法，也是合法請假，這番話讓館長相當不爽。
館長回顧過去曾經跟韓國瑜的直播，當時他直接詢問韓「你會不會像其他人一樣『落跑』去選總統？」，韓肯定的回答「不會跟他們一樣」，但如今做的卻和當初的承諾完全不一樣，讓館長氣得狂飆三字經。

館長甚至還表示「韓國瑜的粉絲，如果你們老婆在外面『討客兄』都沒關係嗎？」「你老婆當初跟你說『愛你一萬年、一輩子跟你在一起』，那你老婆為什麼要去給人家X？結果你回答『沒辦法嘛，大家太想X我老婆』。」館長用這個老婆外遇的例子說明韓國瑜「落跑」選總統。
館長氣憤的表示「大家太想X你老婆，你老婆就要給人家X？這是什麼道理？」、「太多人對他選總統有希望，他就要Yes I do又是什麼道理？」痛批韓國瑜沒有信守當初給大家的承諾，竟隨便找一個不合理的理由就帶職參選，館長接著猛批他「背信忘義，又厚顏無恥」。
館長表示，當初不少粉絲因為他的關係投給韓國瑜，如今他表示「你叫我再支持你，我他X又不是弱智」，並且會用盡全力去反韓國瑜。

The curator slammed South Korea’s ""returning the letter and forgetting the shame and shamelessness""
03 Nov 2019, 06:26 by Zhu Jinwei
The curator recently broadcasted a resurgence of South Korea’s Yu, and mentioned that South Korea’s Yu was asked to “slack the way” in the youth forum, but answered “other people are also like this” “I am not illegal”, and South Korea’s Yu once made his show. The promise was completely the opposite, and the curator was so angry that he was arrogant. The curator also used the ""women's brother"" as an example to illustrate the Korean election, and the approval of Han's letter of obedience and shamelessness, and said that this time he will never be deceived again.
The curator mentioned that in the youth forum of the South Korean Yoga Office, some young people asked about the ""slippery"". South Korea Yu said that the executive dean, some legislators, and the United States, Obama have all taken the election. I did not violate the law, but also legal leave, which made the curator quite uncomfortable.
The curator reviewed the live broadcast of the past with South Korea. At that time, he directly asked Han ""Would you like to ""run away"" like other people to choose the president?"" Han answered affirmatively ""will not be like them"", but nowadays However, it was completely different from the original promise, and the curator was so angry that he was arrogant.

The curator even said that ""Norwegian Yu fans, if your wife is outside the ""women"", does it matter?"" ""Your wife said to you, ""Love you for 10,000 years, stay with you forever"", then why is your wife? Going to give someone X? As a result, you replied, ""No way, everyone wants X my wife."" The curator used this example of his wife's affair to explain that South Korea's Yu ""running away"" elected president.
The curator said with anger that ""everyone wants X your wife, your wife will give someone X? What is the reason?"" ""Too many people have hope for his president. What is the truth of Ye I do?"" It was painful that South Korea Yu did not abide by the promises given to everyone. He even took an unreasonable reason to lead the election. The curator then fiercely criticized him for ""respecting his faith and being brazen.""
The curator said that many fans had voted for South Korea Yu because of his relationship. Now he said, ""You told me to support you again, I am not mentally handicapped,"" and will use all efforts to fight against South Korea.
