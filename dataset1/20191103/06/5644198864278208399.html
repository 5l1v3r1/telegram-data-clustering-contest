      <p>PARIS:Â Marseille took advantage of two comical defensive mix-ups to secure a 2-1 win at home to Lille on Saturday (Nov 2) that sent them up to fourth in Ligue 1 and alleviated some of the pressure on coach Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
      <p>Morgan Sanson stroked home the opening goal on 48 minutes after Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan spilled a cross following a hefty collision with team-mate Gabriel.</p>

      <p>The Brazilian centre-back unwittingly gifted Marseille a second goal 11 minutes from time when Valentin Rongier's tame shot struck Dario Benedetto before Adama Soumaoro's attempted headed clearance struck Gabriel and looped in off the post.</p>
      <p>Lille captain Soumaoro rose magnificently to nod in a corner to give the visitors hope but Marseille held on to move level with third-placed Nantes on 19 points.</p>
      <p>It was just a second win in seven league outings for Marseille and the ideal tonic for a team dumped out the League Cup in midweek following a display branded "shameful" by Villas-Boas.</p>
      <p>That 2-1 loss at Monaco followed a 4-0 humbling away to Paris Saint-Germain, a defeat which left OM winless in 16 Ligue 1 meetings with their greatest rivals.</p>
      <p>"I think we deserved the win. We played with everything we'd been missing the past two matches," said Villas-Boas.</p>
      <p>"We spoke (this week). We were all frustrated because we played two good second halves, which shows we're capable of doing it. It just needs to be applied for 90 minutes."</p>
      <p>As for Lille, Christophe Galtier's side have not won away from home in the league since March and missed the opportunity to reduce the gap to leaders PSG.</p>
      <p>"I think we're going to be in the New Year's Eve bloopers," said Galtier. "You can't concede goals like that at this level, two goals from big mistakes."</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEPAY MAGIC BOOSTS LYON</b>
      </p>
      <p>Memphis Depay conjured up a superb 95th-minute winner as Lyon twice fought back from a goal behind to defeat Toulouse 3-2.</p>
      <p>Yaya Sanogo put Toulouse ahead on 15 minutes but Depay soon levelled after a slick assist from Jeff Reine-Adelaide.</p>

      <p>Toulouse regained the lead when Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes crashed into team-mate Jason Denayer coming for a cross, with the ball rolling off Lopes into the net.</p>
      <p>Moussa Dembele's eighth goal of the season pulled Lyon level again before a brilliant solo strike from Depay won it at the death.</p>
      <p>"This should make the players take note that you must never give up," said Lyon boss Rudi Garcia, whose side moved up to eighth.</p>
      <p>"Even when we were trailing twice I felt there was character in this team and this proves the players refused to accept defeat."</p>
      <p>Angers climbed to second, seven points adrift of PSG, as a Stephane Bahoken penalty earned the hosts a 1-0 victory over Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Amiens beat Brest 1-0 at the Stade de la Licorne, where a 25-year-old home fan was rushed to hospital after suffering a head injury following a nasty fall.</p>
      <p>The man was reportedly bleeding heavily after tumbling several metres from a stand on to concrete. An update from the stadium announcer said the supporter had since regained consciousness.</p>
      <p>Metz remain in the bottom three after blowing a two-goal advantage in a 2-2 draw at home to Montpellier, while the clash between Nimes and Rennes was postponed due to heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Defending champions PSG suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Dijon, who started the weekend at the foot of the table, on Friday with coach Thomas Tuchel accusing his expensively-assembled team of "being too passive and not playing together".</p>
      <p>It was the third loss of the season for PSG who could also see their lead at the top trimmed to just five points by the end of the weekend.</p>
