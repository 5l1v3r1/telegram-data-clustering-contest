飛來橫禍 墾丁遙控滑翔機砸死抱童婦女

03 Nov 2019, 06:18

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】台灣南部墾丁龍磐公園2日舉辦一年一度「F3F無動力滑翔機國際公開賽」，不幸發生遙控無動力滑翔機失控砸死女遊客事件。當時女遊客還抱著一名2歲男童，也遭刮傷。事故發生後，所有選手都感到震驚與遺憾。
中央社報導，恆春警分局表示，這項比賽2日起一連3天在墾丁龍磐公園舉行，各國好手齊聚。當天下午4時50分，由美國隊隊員大衛．克提納（David Cortina）操控的滑翔機突然失控，砸死500公尺外在龍磐公園步道上賞景的35歲林姓婦人，林婦抱著的2歲男童頸部也被割傷，送醫發現傷口頗深，但意識清楚。
大衛．克提納昨晚拒絕夜間偵訊，今天上午由美國在台協會派律師協助他偵訊。昨晚大衛初步向警方提及，他一開始操作時很順利，但飛機突然不見了，隨後聽到有人大叫撞到人了。
對於在國家公園發生從天而降的災難，死者林姓婦人的父親認為太離譜，向媒體表示，他要申請國賠。
協會理事長曾國棟已完成偵訊，協會今天上午發出新聞稿表示，昨天下午當地風況轉強，由於這項活動參賽機都沒有動力，因此受風力影響很大，推測美國肇事選手極可能是因為場地較不熟悉，加上天氣突然轉變影響，導致滑翔機失控，大幅偏離規劃航道墜毀，並造成遊客傷亡。
曾國棟表示，大衛．克提納是2017年在龍磐舉行遙控飛機「颱風賽」的美國冠軍隊成員。
曾國棟表示，發生這個不幸事件，協會昨晚已做成停賽決議，並將選手繳交的報名費等各項費用捐助給傷亡家屬，作為慰問金；這項活動都按規定辦理保險，目前已通知保險公司進行後續理賠，並將盡力協助肇事選手處理善後事宜。
曾國棟表示，龍磐國際公開賽已舉辦數年，無論是場地安全及清潔維護，保險及參賽資格等，都有完善規劃，並正式向墾管處提交申請，墾管處在賽前一天派員會勘，都符合申請項目。
他說，墾丁龍磐特殊崩崖地形，被譽為全球最佳飛行地點之一，斜坡滑翔機是一種運用大自然風力的飛行方式，完全不自備動力，不僅沒有噪音，同時也不會排放任何廢氣，可以說是最環保的飛行活動。
曾國棟表示，多年來在龍磐舉辦的賽事頗受國際好評，而在龍磐產生的台灣選手目前也保持世界第一的殊榮，在全球斜坡滑翔機領域裡，成功把台灣推上國際舞台，發生事故，所有選手都感到震驚與遺憾。

Flying to the sun, the remote control glider, the dead child, the woman

03 Nov 2019, 06:18

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The annual ""F3F Unpowered Glider International Open"" was held on the 2nd in Kenting Longyi Park in southern Taiwan. Unfortunately, the remote-controlled unpowered glider lost control of the female tourist. At the time, the female tourist was also holding a 2-year-old boy and was also scratched. After the accident, all the players were shocked and regretted.
The Central News Agency reported that the Hengchun Police Branch said that the competition was held in Longjing Park in Kenting for three days from the 2nd. At 4:50 pm that day, by the American team member David. The glider controlled by David Cortina suddenly got out of control, and the 35-year-old Lin surnamed 500 meters away on the Longyan Park Trail, the 2-year-old boy held by Lin Lin was also cut. The doctor found that the wound was quite deep, but the consciousness was clear.
David. Ktina rejected the night-time interrogation last night. This morning, the US Taiwan Association sent a lawyer to assist him in the investigation. Last night, David mentioned to the police that he had been operating smoothly at first, but the plane suddenly disappeared, and then he heard someone yelling at someone.
For the disaster that occurred in the national park from the sky, the father of the deceased Lin’s woman thought that it was too outrageous and told the media that he would apply for a national compensation.
The chairman of the association, Zeng Guodong, has completed the investigation. The association issued a press release this morning saying that the local winds strengthened yesterday afternoon. Because the event has no motivation, it is greatly affected by the wind. It is speculated that the American accident player is most likely because The site was less familiar, and the sudden change in weather caused the glider to lose control, drastically deviating from the planned channel crash and causing tourist casualties.
Zeng Guodong said that David. Ktina is a member of the American Championship team that held the typhoon ""remote"" in Longyan in 2017.
Zeng Guodong said that in the event of this unfortunate incident, the association had made a suspension resolution last night and donated the fees and other expenses paid by the players to the casualties as a condolence payment. This activity is handled according to regulations. Inform the insurance company to make follow-up claims, and will try their best to assist the players in dealing with the aftermath.
Zeng Guodong said that the Longyan International Open has been held for several years. Both the site safety and cleaning maintenance, insurance and qualifications have been well-planned, and the application was formally submitted to the management office. The management office dispatched personnel one day before the competition. The survey will be in line with the application.
He said that Kenting Longjing's special cliff topography is regarded as one of the best flight locations in the world. The slope glider is a kind of flight mode that uses natural wind power. It does not have its own power, not only no noise, but also no emissions. Exhaust gas is arguably the most environmentally friendly flight activity.
Zeng Guodong said that the events held in Longyan for many years have been well received by the international community, and the Taiwanese players born in Longyan are also the world's No. 1 winners. In the field of global slope gliders, they have successfully brought Taiwan to the international arena and accidents. All the players were shocked and regretted.
