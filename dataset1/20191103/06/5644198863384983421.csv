TURIN, Italy: Juventus stayed top of Serie A and maintained their winning routine in fixtures against their less glamorous neighbours Torino when a second-half goal from Matthijs de Ligt gave them a 1-0 away win in Saturday's Derby della Mole.
The 20-year-old Dutchman hooked the ball in following a corner midway through the second half of a scrappy, bad-tempered match.
