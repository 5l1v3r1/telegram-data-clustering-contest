日前在江蘇開唱的「JJ」林俊傑，當時因感冒太過嚴重，特地前往當地醫院吊點滴，讓人相當擔憂他的身體。昨（2日）晚JJ「聖所2.0」巡迴演唱會來到重慶，他就與現場跟歌迷分享自己的身體狀況：「一開始以為只是一般的感冒，後來確診竟得了5歲以下小朋友才會得的『手足口症』，嘴巴裡面長了70多顆的潰瘍。」
JJ坦言自己這幾天身體不舒服，狀態不好，但就算不說話也希望歌迷的熱情和尖叫聲也不要停。讓人窩心的是，滿場歌迷得知JJ要抱病唱滿3小時，一見到他準備在台上換裝脫掉外套，都心疼高呼「不要脫」。在JJ演唱《可惜沒如果》一曲時，歌迷更是全程合唱，體恤JJ的辛苦，讓人相當感動。

Lin Junjie blew himself to ""hand, foot and mouth disease"". More than 70 ulcer fans in his mouth helped chorus
03 Nov 2019, 06:48 by Entertainment Group
Singer Lin Junjie was sung in Jiangsu when he started singing in Jiangsu. He was exposed to ""hand, foot and mouth disease"" at the concert in Chongqing last night, which is the ""gut virus"" infection we often hear.


The fans are very hard-working, Lin Junjie is hard, and the chorus ""Unfortunately not"" is moving. (Reviewed from Lin Junjie's Facebook)

Lin Junjie, the ""JJ"" who sang in Jiangsu a few days ago, was too serious for a cold. He went to the local hospital to hang a little bit, which made people worry about his body. Yesterday (2nd) night JJ ""Sanctuary 2.0"" tour concert came to Chongqing, he shared his physical condition with the fans on the spot: ""At first I thought it was just a general cold, and later I was diagnosed with a child under 5 years old. The ""hand, foot and mouth disease"" has more than 70 ulcers in the mouth.""
JJ admitted that he was uncomfortable in the past few days and his condition was not good, but even if he didn't speak, he hoped that the fans' enthusiasm and screams would not stop. It is heart-warming that the fans of the game know that JJ is going to sing for three hours. When he sees that he is going to change his jacket on the stage, he will be distressed and shouting ""Don't take off."" When JJ sang ""Unfortunately not"", the fans were full of chorus, and the hard work of JJ was very moving.
