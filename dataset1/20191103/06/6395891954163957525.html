      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - To the surprise of no one, outfielder Rusney Castillo declined to opt out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox and will remain in their minor league system.</p>
      <p>Castillo agreed to a $72.5 million, seven-year contract in 2014 and has not appeared in a major league game since 2016. He could have voided the final season of his deal, which calls for a $13.5 million salary, and become a free agent.</p>
      <p>Now 32, Castillo hit .278 with 17 homers and 64 RBIs this year for Triple-A Pawtucket.</p>
      <p>He batted .262 with seven homers and 35 RBIs over 99 games for the Red Sox from 2014-16, then was sent outright to Pawtucket in June 2016. Because Boston removed him from the 40-man roster, Castillo's salary didn't count toward Boston's luxury tax payroll. Under a change in the labor contract agreed to after the 2016 season, Castillo's salary would count toward the tax payroll if Boston put him back on the 40-man roster and later sent him outright to the minors again.</p>
