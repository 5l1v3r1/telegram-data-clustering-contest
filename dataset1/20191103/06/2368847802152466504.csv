火燒新華社 港人11·2抗爭「驅逐共匪」11月2日，香港民間在維園舉行大集會，遭港警狂放催淚彈並出動水砲車清場。下午5點左右，位於灣仔的《新華社》香港分社遭破壞並縱火，門外也被噴上「驅逐共匪」等字眼。

港急救員被中國製催淚彈炸傷 背部皮膚焦黑（視頻）11月2日晚，香港警方在銅鑼灣時代廣場清場過程中，向記者和義務急救人員投擲中國製催淚彈。催淚彈在一名急救人員背部爆開，導致其背部大面積皮膚燒傷，受傷急救員當即痛苦倒地，並出現休克情況。
四中全會釋信號 中共擬3招「管治」香港中共四中全會公報稱對香港澳門「依法實行管治」，中共官員續解釋「加強香港法治」，釋放出繼續強硬打壓港人抗爭的信號。港媒總結，依照《基本法》，中共有三方面「法律工具」收緊管控，包括在香港實施大陸法律。
港民含淚致謝大紀元：是你們陪我們往前走「是你們（《大紀元》）才讓那麼多人明白，我們真的是在被人打壓」，香港一名反送中抗爭者哽咽地說，現在她才明白「你們陪著我們在往前走。」
港警腰斬集會抓2百人創紀錄 拘3區議會候選人惹眾怒週六（2日），香港多區舉行集會和遊行，警方隨後暴力清場，包括多個合法集會也遭腰斬。當晚街戰持續到次日凌晨，官方稱抓捕超過二百人，創下一日內抓人最高記錄。警方還拘捕至少3名區議會候選人，被指暴力干預選舉。
組圖：港警暴力干預選舉 抓3候選人及200多人11月2日下午3點，香港民眾在維園舉行「112求援國際，堅守自治」集會，向國際發出求援訊息。同時，全球17國家46個城市將同步舉行集會聲援香港。130多名民主派區議會選舉候選人在維園舉行選民聚會，但集會剛剛開始，就遭到大批防暴警察暴力干預。警方發射催淚彈，濫捕濫抓。

開槍港警化名受訪:政客應做更好 支持獨立調查香港爆發反送中抗爭運動以來，警方濫用暴力不斷升級，多位警察更開槍射擊實彈。日前一名曾開槍警員在警總接受彭博社訪問，稱事後被示威者起底，生活嚴重受影響。他表示對於「五大訴求」而言，只要調查範圍夠廣泛，進行「獨立調查是合理」。同時還表示理解示威者向警員叫罵，並非針對警察，只是「表達對政府的憤怒」。
美中仍無高階談判 美:尚餘突出議題繼續副部磋商美中原計劃11月中旬簽署「第一階段貿易協議」，但敲定協議文本的高階談判至今仍未排上日程。日前雙方談判代表通話，美方隨後表示，還有突出議題需要解決，繼續低階談判。
