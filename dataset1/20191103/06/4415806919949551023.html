      <p>A 310-year-old antique violin worth £250,000 which was stolen from a train in London has been returned to its owner with no damage.</p>
      <p>Professional musician Stephen Morris, who said it was “devastating” to lose the instrument made by craftsman David Tecchler in 1709, reported the violin as missing on October 22.</p>
      <p>He said he left the violin on the London Victoria to Orpington train when he got off at Penge East.</p>
      <p>Tweeting the news that the violin had been returned, Mr Morris wrote: “My violin is home safe and sound! Thanks for the overwhelming support.”</p>

      <p>Overseen by plain-clothes police officers, the instrument was handed over to Mr Morris at a car park in Beckenham on Friday evening after a suspect was identified.</p>
      <p>The BBC reported that the man who had the violin apologised and said he had made a mistake.</p>
      <p>Mr Morris told the BBC: “I feel a bit battered and bruised… I haven’t had a great deal of sleep since it went missing.</p>
      <p>“He was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person.”</p>

      <p>British Transport Police (BTP) had previously said a man had taken the violin as the train approached Bromley South station, and got on a connecting train.</p>
      <p>Police released a CCTV image of a man they believed to be connected to the incident; a person then sent a direct message to Mr Morris on Twitter who identified him.</p>
      <p>BTP said it would be taking no further action against the man, as he had contacted Mr Morris and handed the violin back.</p>
      <p>Mr Morris said: “It couldn’t have ended in a happier way.”</p>
