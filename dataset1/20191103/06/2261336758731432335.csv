Video: Canelo Alvarez scores spectacular, crushing KO of Sergey Kovalev
03 Nov 2019, 06:12 by Mookie Alexander
It was not a great fight by any means, but Canelo Alvarez (53-1-2, 36 KOs) is now a world champion at light heavyweight.
Moving up two divisions from his present middleweight (160 lbs), he engaged in a tactical, if a bit action-starved boxing match with Sergey Kovalev (33-4-1, 29 KOs) at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was closely contested through ten rounds, but Canelo turned up the heat in the 11th and started to land some big shots. A big right hand and left hook had the Russian on skates, and another right hand put Kovalev down and out cold against the ropes. Referee Russell Mora immediately stopped the right, and for obvious reason.

Canelo now has the WBO title at 175 lbs, taking the belt away in spectacular fashion in an otherwise unspectacular contest. Kovalev started 2019 having regained the WBO belt by avenging his loss to Eleider Alvarez, but after defending that belt against Anthony Yarde in August, his reign as champion ends in the most brutal knockout defeat of his career.
Watch the KO below:






Hopefully that was worth the long, UFC 244-related wait for the Canelo fans in Las Vegas. This is one of the best KOs of 2019.
Here’s our play-by-play of the ending:
Round 11 - Alvarez catches Kovalev with a couple of power punches to the head. Uppercut by Canelo. Kovalev not doing a whole lot in this frame and he takes a left hook. Another left hook by Alvarez.

AND CANELO KNOCKS KOVALEV OUT COLD WITH A RIGHT HAND!!!! WOW!!!! HE SLUMPED HIM AND KOVALEV IS HALFWAY OUT OF THE RING!Official result: Canelo Alvarez def. Sergey Kovalev by KO at 2:15 of round 11 to win the WBO light heavyweight title
