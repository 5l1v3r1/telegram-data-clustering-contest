      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> is 'doing a Coleen Rooney' as he tries to track down who leaked his birthday invitations.</p>
      <p>Simon, 60, is not at all happy that news of his big bash got out.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10268137/simon-cowell-catch-birthday-leak/">The Sun</a> , he was due to have dinner at trendy Chelsea restaurant La Famiglia.</p>
      <p>That was suddenly postponed but the Celebrity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> judge is not happy the invites were seen by people not on his 80-strong guestlist.</p>
      <p>Now he wants to find out who has been sending them around - and he has taken inspiration from Mrs Rooney as he looks to get to the bottom of it.</p>

      <p>She accused Rebekah Vardy, the wife of Leicester City striker Jamie, of selling stories on her in a public spat last month.</p>
      <p>Simon will also play detective as he attempts to find the guilty party.</p>
      <p>“No stone is being left unturned; Simon and his team are on a mission," a source said.</p>
      <p>“Inspired by Coleen and her intrepid Wagatha Christie efforts, Simon is wading through his party list, trying to figure out possible motives: greed, publicity, desperation or revenge.</p>

      <p>“The invites were all sent out from a secure email address, so this is being looked at, too.</p>
      <p>"Simon can be quite the sleuth when he puts his mind to it - the culprit should be quaking in their Louboutins.”</p>
      <p>The music mogul called his celebration off and blamed a diary clash.</p>

      <p>The cancellation notice read: "Dear all, I am so sorry but this dinner is cancelled/postponed.</p>
      <p>"Scheduling conflicts unfortunately are prohibiting us from having this dinner at this time.</p>
      <p>"We will keep you posted as to when it will be rescheduled for."</p>
