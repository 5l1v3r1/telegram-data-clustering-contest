        <b>Mexican great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez further added to his legacy by taking the WBO light-heavyweight crown from Sergey Kovalev with a devastating 11th-round knockout in Las Vegas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Middleweight king Canelo, 29, had stepped up two weight divisions to face the 36-year-old Russian.</p>
      <p>It proved a close fight which failed to ignite before an explosive combination from Canelo ended Kovalev's night.</p>
      <p>Canelo has now won world titles in four weight divisions.</p>
      <p>A cagey encounter at the MGM Grand appeared to be heading to a 12th round and one for the judges to decide before a left hook-right hand combination came from nowhere and left Kovalev floundering on the ropes.</p>
      <blockquote>Canelo will make history. It's a guarantee.<cite>Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Judges had Canelo slightly ahead at that point on their scorecards.</p>
      <p>"The plan was patience, to have patience," Canelo said. "We knew it would take time for me to get to him. I am new at this division, but overall it was successful."</p>
      <p>Canelo, the best-paid fighter in the sport, said winning a title at a fourth weight was an attempt to further enhance his reputation in his boxing-obsessed homeland.</p>
      <p>"This is just one step in my history," he said. "Be patient because Canelo will make history. It's a guarantee."</p>
      <p>He started his career at 139lbs when he boxed as a 15-year-old on debut in 2005 and had won world titles at light-middleweight, middleweight and super-middleweight before this latest victory.</p>
      <p>Kovalev was a tough opponent in what was his 16th consecutive world title fight, a run which started when he dismantled Briton Nathan Cleverly in Cardiff in 2013.</p>
      <p>But the victory means Canelo still has just one defeat in 56 fights - against Floyd Mayweather in 2013.</p>
      <p>Following the fight Canelo was also asked about who he could face next - a third fight against former middleweight rival Gennady Golovkin has long been mooted.</p>
      <p>"We have to see what happens," the Mexican said. "We have to see what's best for us and look for the best fights."</p>
      <p>"We've fought 24 rounds and I beat him. It's really not a challenge for me, but if it represents business, why not?," he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another Mexican, <b>Miguel Berchelt,</b> successfully defended his WBC world super-featherweight title with a fourth-round knockout of American Jason Sosa at the Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, California.</p>
