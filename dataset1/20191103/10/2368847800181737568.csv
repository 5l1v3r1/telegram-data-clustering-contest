一位重度殘疾者的遭遇

03 Nov 2019, 10:30

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】河南省鹿邑縣重度殘疾人、法輪功學員李國梁因堅持修煉法輪功，遭綁架、誣判3年，至今仍在監獄裡遭受迫害。
明慧網報導，李國梁（良）修煉前患有強直性脊髓炎，從胯部到頸椎都不能彎曲，走路時只能靠膝關節一點點地彎曲挪動，生活十分不方便。這種狀態已有二三十年之久，最嚴重時，他甚至精神失常。
後來李國梁修煉法輪功，雖然他做不了煉功動作，但法輪功的威力也在他身上顯示出來。他完全不能動的手能活動了，幾乎張不開的嘴可以張開吃東西了；更可喜的是，他的精神完全恢復成一個健全的人。
李國梁開始做一些小生意自食其力。他讓家人給買了輛三輪車，批發一些小東西在車上賣。因為他只能站著把握方向，需要改裝車把兒的高度，但當修車師傅也不知如何改裝時，他便指導師傅成功改裝了車把兒。
鹿邑縣城的一些臨街商戶和熟悉他的人都以他為榜樣教育子女：你看看人家一個殘障人士，都能自食其力。
李國梁經常將法輪功的美好告訴人們，還告訴人們善惡有報的因果關係。曾經有一個小偷聽了他的話後，從此改邪歸正，做起小生意。
李國梁的勵志故事曾經在鹿邑本地的媒體上刊載，也有相關醫療研究機構認為他的事情就是一個奇蹟，曾想對他進行深入研究。
2015年12月31日，當時40歲左右的李國梁被綁架，後被誣判、非法關押到鄭州監獄。因李國梁不「轉化」（放棄修煉），獄方一直派包夾（監管法輪功學員的刑事犯）對他進行隨身監控，他上廁所都需要先報告。
即使在艱難的環境中，他都儘量不麻煩別人，水房、廁所常有積水，只要有時間他就要掃一掃；監獄每到節日發的很少的一點水果或其它食物，他都要留給別人。
李國梁的妹妹已經去世，但在他被綁架到監獄不久，他的妹夫還帶著新娶的妻子一起去監獄探視他，給他存上錢，囑咐他照顧好自己的生活和身體，可見李國梁的善良為人和融洽的家庭關係。
如此善良、勵志的人卻遭到迫害。鹿邑縣警察在綁架李國梁時，還故意推搡折磨他重度殘障的身體。
在監獄中，有一次犯人吳陵印趁監室人都外出時，對李國梁大打出手，致使他有半年多的時間下不了床，而獄警對此一直不做任何處理。

The experience of a severely disabled person

03 Nov 2019, 10:30

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Li Guoliang, a severely disabled person and Falun Gong practitioner in Luyi County, Henan Province, was abducted and sentenced to three years for insisting on practicing Falun Gong. He is still persecuted in prison.
Minghui.com reported that Li Guoliang (liang) suffered from ankylosing myelitis before practicing. He could not bend from the ankle to the cervical vertebra. When walking, he could only bend and flex by the knee joint. Life is very inconvenient. This state has been around for twenty or thirty years. In the worst case, he was even insane.
Later, Li Guoliang practiced Falun Gong. Although he could not do the exercises, the power of Falun Gong was also shown in him. His completely incapable hand can move, and the mouth that can't be opened can open his mouth to eat. What is more gratifying is that his spirit is completely restored to a healthy person.
Li Guoliang began to do some small business to support himself. He asked his family to buy a tricycle and wholesale some small things to sell in the car. Because he can only stand and grasp the direction, he needs to modify the height of the handlebars. However, when the car repairer does not know how to modify it, he instructed the master to successfully modify the handlebars.
Some street-facing merchants in Luyi County and people familiar with him use his role as a model to educate their children: You can look at people with disabilities who are able to support themselves.
Li Guoliang often tells people about the beauty of Falun Gong and tells people about the causal relationship between good and evil. Once a thief had listened to his words, he changed his mind and changed his mind and started a small business.
Li Guoliang's inspirational story was published in the local media of Luhan, and related medical research institutions thought that his business was a miracle. He wanted to conduct in-depth research on him.
On December 31, 2015, Li Guoliang, who was around 40 years old, was kidnapped and later sentenced and illegally detained to Zhengzhou Prison. Because Li Guoliang did not ""transform"" (abandon cultivation), the prison authorities always sent a double-team (a criminal who supervised Falun Gong practitioners) to carry out his personal surveillance. He had to report to the toilet first.
Even in a tough environment, he tries not to bother others. Water and toilets often have water. If there is time, he will sweep it; if there is very little fruit or other food in the prison, he will stay. give others.
Li Guoliang’s sister has passed away, but soon after he was kidnapped to prison, his brother-in-law went to the prison with his new wife to visit him, save him money, and take care of his life and body. Kindness is a harmonious family relationship.
Such kind and inspiring people have been persecuted. When the Luyi County police kidnapped Li Guoliang, he deliberately shirked his severely disabled body.
In the prison, when a prisoner Wu Lingyin’s prisoner’s office went out, he shot Li Guoliang, causing him to have more than half a year to go to bed, and the prison guards did not do anything about it.
