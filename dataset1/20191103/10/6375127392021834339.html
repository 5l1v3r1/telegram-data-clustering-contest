      <h3>THE first of the four Sundays of Bar examinations administered by the Supreme Court yesterday at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in Manila went off smoothly.</h3>
      <p>Some 600 MPD police officers  were deployed to secure the over  8,000 aspiring lawyers and deter any untoward incident that may happen around the vicinity of the university.</p>
      <p>The MPD assured the examinees and the public of stepped-up security in the next examination days “to provide a conducive environment for our future lawyers to take the examination without the worry of any disruption.”</p>
      <p>A total of 8,245 law graduates took this year’s bar examination, which is considered the toughest licensure test in the country.</p>
      <p>This year’s Bar exams will be held at UST on November 3, 10, 17 and 24.</p>
      <p>The Bar exams covers eight subjects  Political Law,  Civil Law, Taxation, Labor Law, Criminal Law, Remedial Law, Mercantile Law and Legal and Judicial Ethics.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Bar Examinations Committee Chairperson is SC Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe.</p>
      <p>In last year’s Bar exam, only 1,800 out of 8,158 examinees, or 22.7 percent, passed the exam with a graduate from Ateneo de Manila University emerging as number one.</p>
      <p>With a passing rate of 89.306 percent, Sean James B. Borja made his way to the top besting more than 8,000 examinees who took the four-Sunday test.</p>
      <p>Borja was the class valedictorian in Ateneo law school and worked at Gulapa Law as an underbar associate of the firm.</p>
