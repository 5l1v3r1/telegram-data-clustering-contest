Students killed in Afghanistan suicide bombing
03 Nov 2019, 10:36 by Nura Ado Suleiman

A car bomb has killed nine children in the Darfur area of northeastern Afghanistan.

Volunteers say all the boys are students, between the ages of 7 and 11, and were on their way to school at the time of the explosion.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, though the Taliban have not commented on the incident.
In October, the United Nations published a report that the number of civilian casualties in IS and Taliban attacks rose 42 percent, including children, in September, killing 7 children. , as a result of the collision of a mine buried at the side of the road.
