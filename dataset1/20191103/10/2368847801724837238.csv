美國就業數據強勁 標普和納指同創歷史新高

03 Nov 2019, 10:28

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】在美國勞工部公布10月強勁的非農就業報告激勵下，標普500指數11月2日上漲1%至3,066點（今年漲幅達22%），為一週內三度刷新歷史高價，同時也連續四週上漲，創下3月初以來最長上漲紀錄。
與此同時，代表科技股的那斯達克指數也上揚1.1%至8,386點，首度突破7月高峰，創下歷史高價。道指也漲1.1%至27,347點，比7月的歷史高峰僅差51點，預估下週將刷新高價。
市場原本預期美國10月非農就業人數僅增加7.5萬人，但結果是12.8萬人，大幅超出預期，且9月新增的就業人數也上修到18萬人，一掃先前經濟學家悲觀預期美國就業市場將受到製造業衰退衝擊的陰霾。
這份優於預期的就業報告，加上近日公布的第三季GDP增長率達優於預期的1.9%，凸顯美國經濟在貿易戰的紛擾中依舊表現強勁，一般預料美國家庭據此將可毫無後顧之憂地擴張消費，進而推動第四季甚至明年的經濟增長，這也是週五標普和那斯達克續創歷史高價所展現的意義。
在企業獲利方面，標普500大企業迄今有350家已公布第三季財報，其中76%的盈餘擊敗市場預期，而整體盈餘僅小幅下滑0.8%，遠低於先前分析師預估的衰退4.1%，顯示企業獲利並不悲觀。
在製造業方面，IHS Markit公布的10月美國製造業採購經理人指數（PMI）跳升到51.3，雖低於預期的51.5，但高於前月的51.1，且為4月以來最高值。美國供應管理協會（ISM）公布的10月PMI則為48.3，雖仍處於50榮枯線以下，但已較前月的47.8改善。兩項數據顯示，美國製造業也緩慢復甦。
貿易談判也傳來好消息，中方表示在與美方週五的通話中已達成了核心問題的「原則共識」，美方則聲明雙方在解決「突出的問題」。這些正面的聲明也掃除了前一日彭博社引述中方消息人士拋出的負面看法，讓股市的上漲少了阻礙的懸念。
對川普當局而言，經濟持續表現強勁和美股續創歷史新高，正好給予美方在貿易談判中更有利的地位，中方想透過股市動盪等方式擾亂美國經濟，進而迫使美方在談判中讓步的企圖難以得逞，這或許將促成第一階段協議提早完成正式的簽署。
由於第四季向來是美股表現優異的季節（去年第四季受美聯儲鷹派升息導致標普指數下挫20%除外），在目前經濟、就業和企業獲利等各項數據都優於預期的前提下，部分分析師已上看標普500指數年底可漲到3,200點以上。

Strong US employment data, S&P and Nasdaq hit record highs

03 Nov 2019, 10:28

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The S&P 500 index rose 1% to 3,066 points (up 22% this year) on November 2, when the US Department of Labor announced its strong non-farm payrolls report in October. It has set a new high price for three times in a week, and it has also risen for four consecutive weeks, setting a record for the longest rise since the beginning of March.
At the same time, the Nasdaq index, which represents technology stocks, also rose 1.1% to 8,386 points, breaking through the peak in July for the first time, setting a record high. The Dow also rose 1.1% to 27,347 points, which is only 51 points lower than the historical peak in July. It is estimated that the price will be refreshed next week.
The market originally expected the US non-farm payrolls to increase by only 75,000 in October, but the result was 128,000, which was significantly higher than expected, and the number of newly added jobs in September was also revised to 180,000, sweeping away the pessimistic expectations of previous economists. The US job market will be stunned by the manufacturing recession.
This better-than-expected employment report, together with the recently announced third-quarter GDP growth rate, was better than the expected 1.9%, highlighting the strong performance of the US economy in the trade wars. It is generally expected that US households will be able to Unleashing the expansion of consumption, and then promoting economic growth in the fourth quarter or even next year, this is the significance of the continued high prices of S&P and Nasdaq on Friday.
In terms of corporate profits, the S&P 500 companies have so far reported 350 third-quarter earnings, of which 76% of the earnings beat market expectations, while the overall surplus fell only 0.8%, much lower than the previous analyst's forecast. 4.1%, showing that corporate profits are not pessimistic.
In manufacturing, IHS Markit announced that the US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) jumped to 51.3 in October, which was lower than the expected 51.5, but higher than the previous month's 51.1, and the highest since April. The US Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released the PMI for October at 48.3. Although it is still below the 50-point line, it has improved from 47.8 in the previous month. Two data show that the US manufacturing industry is also slowly recovering.
There was good news in the trade negotiations. The Chinese side stated that it had reached a ""principle consensus"" on the core issue during the call with the US on Friday. The US side stated that the two sides are solving ""prominent problems."" These positive statements also wiped out the negative comments that the Chinese sources quoted by Bloomberg on the previous day, and the stock market's rise was less obstructive.
For the Trump administration, the continued strong economic performance and the US stocks have continued to record highs, which has given the US a more favorable position in the trade negotiations. The Chinese side wants to disrupt the US economy through stock market turmoil and thus force the US to make concessions in the negotiations. It’s hard to succeed, which may lead to the early completion of the formal signing of the first phase of the agreement.
Since the fourth quarter has always been a season for US stocks to perform well (except for the 20% decline in the S&P index caused by the Fed’s hawkish rate hike in the fourth quarter of last year), the current economic, employment and corporate profits are better than expected. Next, some analysts have seen the S&P 500 index rise to more than 3,200 points at the end of the year.
