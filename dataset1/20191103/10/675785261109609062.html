      <h1>Edenbridge bonfire: John Bercow effigy is set alight at famous fireworks display</h1>
      <h2>A likeness of the controversial former Speaker was burned at the event in Kent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:38:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Burke</a></address>
      <p>Speaker John Bercow was at the heart of plenty of fireworks in Parliament - and last night a huge likeness of him went down in flames.</p>
      <p>An effigy of the outgoing politician, who stood down this week, was burned last night in Kent.</p>
      <p>But all did not go to plan, as strong winds blew Bercow's head off an 11 metre design which also included <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p>
      <p>Video shows the ex-Buckingham MP's large head being set alight by the Edenbridge Bonfire Society in Kent.</p>
      <p>The group is renowned for picking controversial figures to burn, with Katie Hopkins, Wayne Rooney, Saddam Hussein and Jonathan Ross among its former targets.</p>

      <p>Andrea Deans, who created the Bercow figure, said: "As always, we received many suggestions for who the public would like to see at our event and this year it was a close vote between John Bercow and Piers Morgan.</p>
      <p>"However, John Bercow is not going to be on his own on the night as we have included Johnson, Corbyn and the whole Houses of Parliament to join him."</p>

      <p>Fireworks were also set off at the display, and a large parade was held.</p>
      <p>Following the event, many shared their thoughts on social media.</p>
      <p>Debbie Edwards wrote: "Thank you for the fantastic parade and firework display, especially following the awful <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> today. Well done to all concerned."</p>

      <p>And Leigh Gyngell posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : "Wow amazing this year, well done Edenbridge best yet!"</p>
      <p>Bonfire society chairman Bill Cummings said "This year we have chosen the infuriating Commons Speaker John Bercow as our celebrity guy, and I am sure you will agree that our artist, Andrea Deans, has captured his likeness very well.</p>
      <p>"Our message to Mr Bercow is that you cannot keep disrupting Parliament and this is one situation you cannot argue yourself out of.</p>

      <p>"We hope Mr Bercow will appreciate the humour contained in our caricature and take it in the good spirit with which it is intended."</p>
      <p>The bonfire society says the intention behind its own light-hearted tradition is to bring an element of fun to proceedings, to raise awareness of the event, which raises thousands of pounds for local charities and community organisations.</p>

      <p>The society has been celebrating Bonfire Night for more than 90 years and this year will see more than 750 people joining the torchlit parade through Edenbridge High Street.</p>
      <p>It takes more than 100 volunteers to put on the event and local businesses provide sponsorship or help out with support activities.</p>
