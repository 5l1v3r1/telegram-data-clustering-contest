Christian Horner: ""It’s clear we’ve had a competitive car here this weekend""
03 Nov 2019, 10:32 by Tom Mason

Christian Horner believes the results in qualifying shows just how competitive the car has been in Austin so far this weekend. Aston Martin Red Bull Racing secured a third-place courtesy of Max Verstappen, in qualifying while Alex Albon came through in sixth.

As tight as it was, the Dutchman Verstappen missed out on pole position by just six-hundredths of a second after finishing behind Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel.



""We’ve been in the top three throughout every session so it’s been a positive day and it’s clear we’ve had a competitive car here this weekend, "" Horner told Red Bull after qualifying.
""Now we just need to build on that in the race tomorrow.”



Verstappen still has plenty to race for in the final few races, with just 16 points between himself, Charles Leclerc and Vettel.
As does Albon, who is currently eighth, and just three points off sixth-placed Pierre Gasly.
