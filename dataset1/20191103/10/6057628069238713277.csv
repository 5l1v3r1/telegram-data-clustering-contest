The IS has claimed responsibility for the killing of 49 Malian soldiers in an attack on a camp in Indelimane, a border town of Menaka with the Niger Republic.

IS is also responsible for the killing of one French soldier, who was killed when the militants dispersed a bomb they buried, just as the French barracks hit the Indelimane area on their way to Gao.

At the end of October, militants suspected of being jihadists kidnapped six teachers in central Mali for speaking and teaching French students.
The attack comes after more than 900 schools were closed in parts of Mali, more than two-thirds of them in the central province of Mopti, due to security concerns. religion and ethnic violence.
In another story, in early October, the US pledged a $ 5 million reward, for anyone who helped her with information on the head of the IS branch in sub-Saharan Africa, claiming to kill American and Niger soldiers for two years. the past.
The United States launched the hunt for Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi after he claimed responsibility for an attack on US and Niger forces in Tongo Tongo on October 4, 2017, killing 4 US and 5 Nigerians.
