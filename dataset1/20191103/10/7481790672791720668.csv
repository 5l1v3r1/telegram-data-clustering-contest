　台風１９号による川の増水で橋が崩れて孤立状態だった福島県矢祭（やまつり）町高地原地区で、土のうや大型パイプで応急的に造った橋が完成し、３日から通れるようになった。住民たちは早速、車や自転車で買い物などに出かけ、会社員の１人（５０）は「ようやく以前の生活を取り戻せる」と喜んだ。
　１１世帯約３０人が住む同地区では、橋の崩落後、ＪＲ水郡線の鉄橋を歩いて行き来していた。列車の運行が再開した１日以降は、日中の２時間以外通れなくなっていた。町は半年程度で仮設の橋、３年以内に恒久的な橋の建設を目指す。

In the highland area of the Yamatsuri-cho, Fukushima Prefecture, where the bridge collapsed due to the flooding of the river due to the typhoon No.19, a bridge constructed of sandbags and large pipes was completed, so that it could pass from the 3rd became. Residents immediately went shopping by car or bicycle, and one of the office workers (50) was glad that he finally regained his previous life.
In the same area where about 30 people live in 11 households, they walked on the JR Suizori Line after the collapse of the bridge. After the first day when the train resumed, it was not possible to pass except for two hours during the day. The town aims to build a temporary bridge in about six months and a permanent bridge within three years.
