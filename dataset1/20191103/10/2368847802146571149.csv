貿易戰負面傳聞又起 道指一度回挫268點

03 Nov 2019, 10:19

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】金融市場週四（10月31日）又重燃了美中貿易協議的不確定風險，掩蓋了美股財報優於預期的利多。道指一度下挫268點，尾盤仍收跌140點，VIX恐慌指數上漲逾7%至13.22。
據彭博社引述消息人士的話報導，即使美中即將簽署第一階段協議，中共官員也對達成全面貿易協議表示存疑。此一消息導致投資人擔心貿易戰風暴又起，涵蓋47個國家股市表現的MSCI世界指數週三創下2018年2月以來最高峰，但週四也因此利空而回挫0.37%。
市場原本樂觀希望美中貿易第一階段協定可於11月15～17日在智利舉行的APEC會議中簽定，但智利卻因當地示威抗議而突然宣布取消APEC會議。
儘管如此，中方表示美中貿易談判代表週五仍將舉行電話會談。川普也在推文上說會很快公布另外的簽約定點，同時透露第一階段協議已達成60%，川習兩人將共同簽署協議。
據彭博社報導，第一階段的協議內容包括不再加增關稅（但不等同取消關稅）、規範智慧財產權、不操縱貨幣，以及中方採購大量大豆、豬肉等美方農產品，但不包括解除華為黑名單。
川普此前提到，一旦簽署第一階段協議，將開始進入第二階段談判。但根據彭博社消息，中方不會在最棘手的問題上向美方屈服，同時擔心川普「個性衝動」，擔憂美中簽定的有限協議仍存在被放棄的風險。
消息人士稱，中方的立場是希望川普取消12月15日即將對1,600億美元中國產品課徵的15%關稅，成為第一階段協議或下階段協議的一部分。
該消息可視為中方在第一階段協議簽訂前的討價還價，或許是試探美方對於第一階段協議簽訂的意願有多強烈，若美方放棄或推遲12月15日的新關稅生效，意味著下一階段中方還可進一步予取予求，不排除談到對9月1日開始的1,100億美元商品15%的關稅，以及2,500億美元25%關稅的存廢問題。
一般預料，川普將不會放棄已經課徵的關稅，而未來將課徵的關稅或許推遲，以換取階段性的協議簽訂，一旦中方毀約，美方將用新關稅的生效進行制裁。換言之，新關稅的生效與否將成為美方用來迫使中方履約的一顆活棋。
就金融市場而言，在標普創下歷史新高、全球股市逼近20個月高峰的當下，任何的利空消息都會引發獲利回吐賣壓，貿易戰的風險再起就是其中一個關鍵的因素。
然而，美中貿易戰在歷經了18個月之後，中國經濟已敗象頻現，經濟的衰敗已危及中共統治的威權合法性，預估中方在貿易戰中已沒有負隅頑抗的能力。
而川普面臨2020年大選的挑戰，如何確保經濟不受外力干擾，股市不會出現劇烈波動，消費和投資信心如何穩定攀升，這些經濟的議題刻不容緩。川普似乎有意淡化貿易戰的衝擊，用階段性協議來逐步清理貿易戰場似乎成了勝選的妙招。
在這種美中雙方都有意達成至少階段性協議的前提下，預估貿易戰負面傳聞對股市的衝擊將為期短暫，至少在年底前，股市創新高的動能還不會因此衝擊而瞬間冷卻。

Negative rumors of trade wars again, the Dow once fell 268 points

03 Nov 2019, 10:19

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] The financial market on Thursday (October 31) rekindled the uncertain risks of the US-China trade agreement, covering up the US stocks' earnings better than expected. The Dow once fell 268 points, and the market still closed down 140 points. The VIX panic index rose more than 7% to 13.22.
According to sources quoted by Bloomberg, even if the United States and China are about to sign the first phase agreement, the CCP officials are doubtful about reaching a comprehensive trade agreement. This news led investors to worry about the trade war again, the MSCI World Index, which covers the performance of 47 countries' stock markets, hit its highest peak since February 2018, but fell by 0.37% on Thursday.
The market was optimistic that the first phase of the US-China trade agreement could be signed at the APEC meeting in Chile from November 15 to 17, but Chile suddenly announced the cancellation of the APEC meeting due to local protests.
Despite this, China said that US-China trade negotiators will hold telephone talks on Friday. Trump also said in a tweet that it will soon announce another signing point, and revealed that the first phase agreement has reached 60%, and the two will jointly sign the agreement.
According to Bloomberg News, the first phase of the agreement includes no longer increasing tariffs (but not equal to eliminating tariffs), regulating intellectual property rights, not manipulating currency, and Chinese purchasing large quantities of US agricultural products such as soybeans and pork, but excluding the blacklist of Huawei. .
Trump previously mentioned that once the first phase agreement is signed, it will begin to enter the second phase of negotiations. However, according to Bloomberg News, China will not yield to the US on the most difficult issues, and is worried about Trump’s “personal impulse” and fears that the limited agreement signed by the US and China still has the risk of being abandoned.
According to sources, China’s position is that Trump will cancel the 15% tariff on the upcoming US$160 billion Chinese product on December 15 and become part of the first phase agreement or the next phase agreement.
The news can be regarded as the bargaining price of the Chinese side before the signing of the first phase of the agreement. Perhaps it is to test the US's willingness to sign the first phase agreement. If the US side abandons or delays the new tariff on December 15, it means the next stage. The Chinese side can further seek for it, not to mention the 15% tariff on the US$110 billion commodity that began on September 1, and the 25% tariff on the US$250 billion.
It is generally expected that Trump will not abandon the tariffs already levied, and the tariffs may be postponed in the future in exchange for a phased agreement. Once China breaks the contract, the US will impose sanctions on the entry into force of the new tariff. In other words, the entry into force of the new tariff will become a living chess used by the US to force China to perform.
As far as the financial market is concerned, when the S&P hit a record high and the global stock market is approaching the peak of 20 months, any bad news will trigger profit-taking and selling pressure. The risk of trade war is one of the key factors.
However, after 18 months of the US-China trade war, the Chinese economy has been defeated frequently. The economic decline has jeopardized the authoritarian legitimacy of the CCP's rule. It is estimated that China has no ability to resist in the trade war.
While Trump faces the challenge of the 2020 general election, how to ensure that the economy is not interfered by external forces, the stock market will not experience violent fluctuations, and how the consumption and investment confidence will rise steadily. These economic issues cannot be delayed. Trump seems to be deliberately diluting the impact of the trade war, and using staged agreements to gradually clean up the trade battlefield seems to be a coup for winning the election.
Under the premise that both the United States and China are willing to reach at least a phased agreement, it is expected that the impact of negative rumors of trade wars on the stock market will be short-lived. At least until the end of the year, the kinetic energy of the stock market's new high will not be shocked and cooled.
