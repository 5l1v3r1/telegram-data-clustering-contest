汽車維修問與答：追尾能自己修嗎？

03 Nov 2019, 10:16

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】汽車維修問與答。
讀者Jianming問：你好，我上個星期追尾了。現在冷氣不冷，空調外機風扇也不轉，我還是學生，所以車子一直沒有修，我的車是2014 Toyota RAV4。我能自己修嗎？如果不是很嚴重。謝謝！
李進答：Jianming您好，有可能碰撞導致風扇卡住了，看看是否可以「掰開」？肯需要朋友幫忙。車前方的空調管道和散熱器有可能破裂導致冷媒洩漏。更換管道或散熱器需要一些經驗。自己修不大容易，因為不知道碰撞的嚴重性。
讀者YY問：李進師傅，你好。
1）紅色2003 Pontiac Vibe，每年做防鏽，上星期才發現司機位車頂蓋角位連接和擋風大玻璃接合位置約寸半長有鏽，不知道什麼時候開始。請教怎樣補救？買什麽去清潔和去那裡買？買什麼牌子顏料去塗防止惡化？車是棗紅色所以一直也沒察覺生了鏽。
2）每天第一次啟動汽車時一下就OK，但跟著去別處回來後再撻車去別處要三秒才OK。若一天去六處地方的話，最後那次就要花六秒才能啟動。何解，是否要換濾蕊塞了？
多謝解答!
李進答：YY您好，
1) 擋風玻璃接合的地方不容易解決，需要把擋風玻璃取出後把生鏽的地方打磨，重新打底漆，油漆後再把擋風玻璃安裝。手續不簡單。
2) 這個啟動困難的問題可能出自於水溫傳感器，熱啟動困難是因為傳感器在熱車時仍然是出於冷啟動的狀態。可以請師傅檢查一下，更換起來不難。汽油濾芯Fuel Filter更換起來不難，網上搜尋一下可以有個大概的價格範圍。
讀者YY回信問：李進兄，車內司機前面原裝地毯（Carpet）好像有白霧箘，用了清潔用的漂白水和洗碗水一星期，但幾天後又出來了。不知是何種箘？請問怎處理或買什麽東西來噴灑？謝謝！後面兩座位Carpet暫不受影響，無此問題。謝答覆!
李進答：YY您好，原因可能來自空調的排水管道堵塞，導致空調的冷卻水無法排出，囤積過多後開始溢出。需要清理、打通排水管。

Car maintenance question and answer: Can the rear-end fix it yourself?

03 Nov 2019, 10:16

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Car maintenance questions and answers.
Reader Jianming asked: Hello, I caught up last week. Now the air is not cold, the air conditioner outside the fan does not turn, I am still a student, so the car has not been repaired, my car is 2014 Toyota RAV4. Can I fix it myself? If not very serious. Thank you!
Li Jin: Hello, Jianming, there is a possibility that the collision will cause the fan to get stuck and see if it can be ""opened""? Ken needs a friend to help. Air conditioning ducts and radiators in front of the vehicle may break and cause refrigerant to leak. It takes some experience to replace the pipe or radiator. It’s not easy to fix it yourself, because you don’t know the seriousness of the collision.
Reader YY asked: Master Li Jin, hello.
1) Red 2003 Pontiac Vibe, which is rust-proof every year. Last week, it was discovered that the corner of the driver's roof and the large glass joint of the windshield were about half long and rusty. I don't know when to start. Ask how to remedy? What to buy to clean and go there to buy? What brand of paint to buy to prevent deterioration? The car is reddish, so I haven't noticed the rust.
2) When you start the car for the first time every day, it will be OK, but after you come back elsewhere, you can take another three seconds to get OK. If you go to six places a day, it will take six seconds to start. Why do you want to change the filter plug?
Thank you for your answer!
Li Jin: Hello, YY,
1) The place where the windshield is joined is not easy to solve. It is necessary to remove the windshield, polish the rusted area, re-prime the paint, and then install the windshield after painting. The procedure is not simple.
2) This difficult starting problem may be caused by the water temperature sensor. The hot start is difficult because the sensor is still in a cold start state when it is hot. You can ask the master to check it out. It is not difficult to replace it. It is not difficult to replace the fuel filter Fuel Filter. There is a general price range for online search.
Reader YY wrote back to ask: Li Jinxiong, the original carpet in front of the driver inside the car (Carpet) seems to have white smog, used cleaning bleach and dishwashing water for a week, but came out a few days later. I don't know what kind of trick? How can I handle or buy something to spray? Thank you! The latter two seats Carpet are temporarily unaffected, no such problem. Thank you!
Li Jin A: Hello, YY, the reason may be caused by the blockage of the air conditioning drain pipe, causing the cooling water of the air conditioner to be discharged, and overflowing after hoarding too much. Need to clean and open the drain pipe.
