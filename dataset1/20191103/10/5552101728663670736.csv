新黨候選人楊世光1日宣布總統連署並未達到目標，遺憾連目標的4成都不到，將會退出選舉，並以大局為重，支持國民黨候選人韓國瑜，未來會繼續推廣相關活動，跟支持「一國兩制」的好朋友們分享想法。
新黨候選人楊世光1日舉辦記者會，宣布總統連署連目標的4成都不到，將會退出選舉，並以大局為重，支持國民黨候選人韓國瑜。
新黨前祕書長楊世光在今年7月宣布代表新黨參選，他強調「一國兩制是台灣唯一選擇」，提出的政見包括上任後要將蔡英文繩之以法，還有每年引進1萬名中國人來台，按一個人800萬元的居留證費用，1年就有800億元，所得可以用來補助台灣年輕人沉重的學貸、房貸。他也曾經批評韓國瑜指台灣「又老又窮」的說法，他表示台灣其實一點都不窮，只是分配的問題。
楊世光也在臉書引用報導發文，表示不會將連署書送交國家機器，資料後續會有妥善處理，每個人的個資絕對保密與安全。未來，他也會繼續舉辦相關的活動，與支持一國兩制的好朋友繼續宣揚理念

New Party candidate Yang Shiguang announced on the 1st that the president has not reached the target. Unfortunately, even if the target is less than 40%, he will withdraw from the election and take the overall situation as the priority. He will support the Kuomintang candidate, South Korea Yu, and will continue to promote related activities in the future. Good friends who support ""one country, two systems"" share their ideas.
New Party candidate Yang Shiguang held a press conference on the 1st, announcing that the president would not even reach the target of 40% of the target. He would withdraw from the election and take the overall situation as the priority and support the Kuomintang candidate, South Korea.
The former Secretary-General of the New Party, Yang Shiguang, announced in July this year that he would represent the New Party in the election. He emphasized that ""one country, two systems is the only choice for Taiwan."" The political views put forward include the appointment of Tsai Ing-wen to the law after taking office, and the introduction of 10,000 people each year. When Chinese people come to Taiwan, they will have a residence permit fee of 8 million yuan, and they will have 80 billion yuan in one year. The income can be used to subsidize the heavy learning loans and mortgages of young people in Taiwan. He also criticized the South Korean Yu for saying that Taiwan is ""old and poor"". He said that Taiwan is actually not poor at all, just a matter of distribution.
Yang Shiguang also quoted a report on Facebook, saying that he would not send the book to the state machine, and the information will be handled properly. Everyone’s personal assets are absolutely confidential and safe. In the future, he will continue to hold related activities and continue to promote the concept with friends who support the one country, two systems.
