Jane gets more daring: Butt exposure in new movie?
03 Nov 2019, 10:02 by Mario Bautista
JANE Oineza has done two films so far this year, “Finding You” and “Henerasyong Sumuko sa Love”. She has now completed her third film for 2019, “Tayo Muna Habang Hindi Pa Tayo”, an entry in the 15th Cinema One Originals filmfest that will be shown from November 7 to 17 in selected cinemas. She is paired for the first time with JC Santos, who was last seen in the Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino entry, “Open”. Why is the title of their movie “Tayo Muna Habang Hindi Pa Tayo”?
“Yes, mapapaisip ka and you’d ask ‘Ano raw?’” she laughs. “Pero ganyan talaga 'yung movie. May kaguluhan talaga siya. It’s about problematic relationships and about compromise.”
How is it working with JC? “Frst time naming magkapareha at maganda ang timpla ng movie namin kasi may halong comedy and kilig factor.”
Do they have love scenes? How did she handle them? “Nag-jell agad kami so walang awkwardness sa amin. Maayos ang rehearsals namin before each take with our director, Denise O’Hara. We became close friends while doing this movie. The name of my character is Alex at si JC naman is Carlo. I’m in love with him but I found out that he is not ready to seriously commit to a relationship. So I ask myself if love could survive without commitment and I offered na kami muna habang di pa talagang kami.”
Looks like she’s getting to be more daring after she did “Project Feb. 14” for iWant streaming where she had torrid scenes with McCoy de Leon. Her leading man now, JC, is more used to doing daring roles, just like in “Open” and “Don’t Call Me Tita” where he had butt exposure. How about her?
“May butt exposure din siya rito,” she laughs. “At ako rin, meron. Abangan nyo. Ha ha ha!”
