      <p>Bangkok (AFP) - Beijing said Sunday it is "ready to work" with Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct in the flashpoint South China Sea, where it is accused of building up military installations and bullying fellow claimants.</p>
      <p>China claims most of the resource-rich waterway, a major global shipping route that has long been a source of tension in the region.</p>
      <p>For years, the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been locked in talks for a code of conduct for the sea, where China is accused of deploying warships, arming outposts and ramming fishing vessels.</p>
      <p>The agreement, set to be finished in 2021, will lay out conduct guidelines for the sea along with conflict resolution parameters.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the first reading of the document -- a chance for all members to comment on the draft terms -- was "a very important landmark".</p>
      <p>"We stand ready to work with ASEAN countries building on the existing foundation and the basis to strive for new progress" on the guidelines, he said.</p>
      <p>He added that China wanted to "maintain and uphold long-term peace and stability in the South China Sea".</p>
      <p>The Philippines -- which has sparred with China in the sea -- said Sunday that Beijing is committed to the code, despite its broad claims to the waterway.</p>
      <p>"It recognises the fact that if it doesn't agree to a code of conduct then there will be turmoil in the region," presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told reporters in Bangkok on the sidelines of ASEAN.</p>
      <p>The Philippines in 2016 filed a case with a UN-backed tribunal, which ultimately rejected Beijing's assertions in the sea.</p>
      <p>Tensions in the waterway have flared in recent weeks between China and Vietnam, one of Beijing's most vocal critics on the issue.</p>
      <p>Hanoi hit back at China after it sent a survey ship into waters inside its Exclusive Economic Zone and around islands claimed by both Hanoi and Beijing.</p>
      <p>The ship left after several weeks in the area.</p>
      <p>Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have overlapping claims with China in the sea.</p>
      <p>The US has accused China of bullying behaviour, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week America has been too easy on China.</p>
      <p>"We hesitated and did far less than we should have," he said, referring to China's disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The three-day ASEAN summit in Bangkok closes Monday, with leaders expected to issue a joint statement that will likely include a section on the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Members have tussled in the past over wording in the final statement, with some countries pushing for harsher language against China.</p>
