03 Nov 2019, 10:30 by 精選轉載


我們想讓你知道的是貓貓知道你對他的愛，他很滿意，真的，可是為了尊嚴他必須告訴你誰是老大，身而為貓，我一點也不抱歉。






鼻妹的廢話亂畫


絕大多數的貓奴，照顧貓貓都是無微不至的，貓吃鮮食人吃剩菜，貓吹冷氣人吹電扇，但就在貓貓幾乎被捧成為全地球最尊貴的生物之際，你精挑細選的罐罐他不想吃還是不吃，剛清完的平整的貓砂，貓貓還是會拉在盆子外面。
每有這樣的事情發生，貓奴都會驚訝碎念翻白眼，問自己扛了幾層樓的貓砂回家到底為了什麼。但又能如何？打掃完，還是會抱抱貓貓，對他說「你真可愛」。
其實貓貓知道你對他的愛，他很滿意，真的，可是為了尊嚴他必須告訴你誰是老大，身而為貓，我一點也不抱歉。
