      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>More than 2,400 Pakistani prisoners have been released from jails in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the past year due to the efforts of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.</p>
      <p>“Pakistan has secured the release of 1,245 prisoners from Saudi Arabia and 1,200 more from UAE during the first year of the PTI-led government, which is an unprecedented figure,” an official of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (OPHED) told <i>APP.     </i></p>
