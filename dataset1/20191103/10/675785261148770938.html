      <h1>Deontay Wilder accused of 'flirting' with Riyad Mahrez's wife leaving Man City star 'devastated'</h1>
      <h2>The heavyweight champ reportedly met Mahrez's wife Rita at a Manchester nightclub in August</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:12:12+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Boxing champ Deontay Wilder has sensationally been accused of 'flirting' with the wife of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Riyad Mahrez.</p>
      <p>Algerian Mahrez, a Premier League winner with both City and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , has been left 'devastated' by the developments, report <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10267891/riyad-mahrez-deontay-wilder-flirt-wife-rita/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>Wilder and Mahrez's wife Rita met at Manchester nightclub Club Liv and there was a 'real connection' between the duo, a source told the paper.</p>
      <p>The source said: "They were chatting intently, laughing and joking. You could see there was chemistry there and a real connection. But because of where it was, a lot of people noticed how well they seemed to be getting along.</p>
      <p>“It’s a club full of footballers and Wags, which even some of Riyad’s team-mates go to. Rita was actually on a night out with Riyad’s sisters who she really gets on with.</p>

      <p>“And they did not appear to be happy with what was going on. One even seemed to go and get Rita, to take her away from ­Deontay, who was of course trying to keep her with him.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit of a tug of war over her affections, which of course a few people witnessed.”</p>
      <p>Mahrez is a Muslim non-drinker who snubs the clubbing lifestyle of many of his Premier League colleagues.</p>
      <p>And when reports of the encounter between WBC king Wilder and the 25-year-old wife of his two children filtered back to him - he was reportedly 'devastated'.</p>

      <p>The meeting allegedly took place on Friday August 23, with Wilder spotted at Manchester fashion store The Couture Club the following day, where he met <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> midfielder Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p>Mahrez, 28, married Rita in a private ceremony in August 2015.</p>
      <p>He joined Manchester City for a then club-record £60million fee in July 2018 from Leicester.</p>
      <p>American Wilder, 34, has won 41 of his 42 professional boxing bouts, with 40 of those coming by knockout.</p>
      <p>His only failure to claim victory came against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> in December last year when the duo fought to a draw in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>A rematch between the duo is pencilled in for February next year after Fury's brief stint in WWE.</p>
      <p>Wilder must first negotiate another rematch - against Luis Ortiz - on November 23 in Las Vegas.</p>
