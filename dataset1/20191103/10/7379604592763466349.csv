03 Nov 2019, 10:40 by Hannah Verdier

THE X Factor: Celebrity returned for another night of celebrities battling it out to impress X Factor judges and viewers at home.

Follow our live blog below for all the reaction and gossip from the show...




























Hannah Verdier11 hours agoNovember 2, 2019THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT Right, we're off to download Martin Bashir's Easy now because we've got some hip-swinging dance moves to learn. Not to mention the new lyrics. Altogether now, “ba ba booo… ee… around.” Until next week…
Hannah Verdier12 hours agoNovember 2, 2019THE MOST SHOCKING NIGHT OF X FACTOR: CELEBRITY SO FAR Missed tonight's show? Here's what went down: Coronation Street's Victoria Ekanoye was voted off the show, despite earning praise for her big Beyoncé number. Ex-EastEnders star Jonny Labey was first to perform, but left the show tonight. Martin Bashir forgot his words, but was saved. Simon Cowell refused to cast his vote as the decision reached deadlock, deferring to the public vote instead. Try Star's tribute to the England rugby team earned them a free pass. Louis gave Kevin McHale his safe seat. Simon was so impressed by No Love Lost that he saved them from the public vote. Dermot had a great night, baiting the judges and generally going rogue with the Love Island supporters. Nine acts remain and with the competition wide open they'll be singing for survival next week.
Hannah Verdier12 hours agoNovember 2, 2019“YOU SHOULD'VE WON” OK, so everyone's in shock over Jonny leaving, but let's give his followers the last word. And that word is: GUTTED.
Hannah Verdier12 hours agoNovember 2, 2019SAFE SEATS Tonight's shocks began with the dishing out of the safe seats. Simon gave his free pass to No Love Lost, after their Charles & Eddie-fuelled performance. Louis made sure Kevin McHale was safe from the public vote after he sang Dance Monkey, flanked by a load of legs. And after Try Star brought the house down in a very different way to last week, Nicole kept them safe because they sang Swing Low, Sweet Chariot as a tribute to the England rugby team. But that left her acts at risk. Although Nicole heaped praise on Victoria Ekanoye for her gutsy performance of Beyoncé's Why Don't You Love Me? it wasn't enough to save the soap star.
Hannah Verdier12 hours agoNovember 2, 2019MEGAN'S A STRONGER CONTENDER Tonight's X Factor: Celebrity had its shocks, but it also gave us the glimpse of the future superstar that is Megan McKenna. Stripped down in styling and song, she performed the emotional ballad that she wrote about her late grandad. Stronger was a hit with the judges as she once again proved she's a force to be reckoned with.
