      <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard says his side are enjoying life on the road so much because of their work ethic.</p>
      <p>The Blues posted a club-record seventh successive away win in all competitions when they beat Watford 2-1 at Vicarage Road on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic earned the points and ensured another enjoyable bus ride home.</p>

      <p>Asked what he thought the away form was down to, Lampard said: “I don’t think there’s one absolute thing that’s making us win, they’re just working hard, the way we’re working off the ball.</p>
      <p>“Maybe away from home teams slightly open up against us slightly more.</p>
      <p>“Today wasn’t one of them but that gives us the opportunity with the pace we have that we can counter-attack and create chances, whereas maybe at Stamford Bridge teams can make it more difficult to do that with such freedom. Maybe that’s why we have been so free-flowing away from home.”</p>

      <p>Lampard’s men are also blessed with pace which allows them to turn defence into attack at speed.</p>
      <p>“Willian takes people out of the game with his pace and I love that Christian scored a goal from four yards out,” Lampard added.</p>
      <p>“He could have decided not to go the extra mile and that ball flashes across the face and no one gets on the end of it.</p>

      <p>“If he continues doing that sort of thing then the goals will rack up. His general performance was top as well.”</p>
      <p>A comfortable evening was turned into a nervy one after VAR awarded Watford a penalty which Gerard Deulofeu tucked away and in the end Chelsea needed a massive save from Kepa Arrizabalaga to deny opposite number Ben Foster with the last action of the game.</p>
      <p>Foster, who had kept the scoreline respectable with a number of saves, was sent forward for a free-kick and saw his goalbound header kept out by the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>“To get a draw would have been an unbelievable turnaround,” Foster told the club’s official website.</p>

      <p>“It was a really good save. I’ve never scored, and this was the closest I’ve ever come. Fair play to Kepa, it was a really good save.</p>
      <p>“I just closed my eyes and hoped for the best.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t at our best, I’ll be honest. We’re close, we know it and we believe it’s not far away.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t get started until 2-0 down. We can’t let ourselves get one or two down before getting competitive.”</p>
