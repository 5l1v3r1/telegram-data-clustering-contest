Jorge Masvidal Defeats Nate Diaz Via Doctor Stoppage; Wins BMF Title
03 Nov 2019, 10:37 by Oisin McQueirns

Jorge Masvidal is the official owner of the esteemed title of ‘baddest motherf*cker in the UFC’ after he defeated Nate Diaz via doctor stoppage at UFC 244 in New York City last night.

Masvidal and Diaz put on an instant classic as expected at Madison Square Garden despite the finish, which came at the end of round three, not quite being a popular choice with the fans.
‘Gamebread’ was coming into this fight off the back of the promotion’s quickest ever knockout over Ben Askren in July, but it was Diaz who looked as though he had control early, walking Masvidal down in his typical style.



Masvidal settled however and after getting locked in the clinch he hit Diaz with a big inside elbow which cut the Stockton native, before a head-kick knocked him to the mat.
Diaz was bleeding heavily but showed his patented endurance as he and finished strong in the opening round before entering the second with big pressure once again.
It was Masvidal again though who was doing the damage with a number of big shots to the already crimson face of his opponent before a huge kick to the body rocked Diaz.



Diaz’s endurance has been a staple of his UFC career and he showed it in abundance in MSG as he absorbed some massive shots from Masvidal and in the third round it was more of the same – Gamebread hitting big, but Diaz staying in there.
The cut above his eye was noticeably deep though and just before the start of the championship rounds, the doctor came in to check on Diaz and despite the fighter’s insistence on continuing, the bout was stopped.
“I didn’t think they were going to stop it,” Diaz said afterwards. “I was just getting ready to get started.



“He got the job done like he was supposed to so right on to Jorge for what he did. But I’m coming back for your ass, motherf*cker. Let me heal up and let’s go again.”
Masvidal was in agreement that the two should run in back when Diaz recovers.
“I told Nate right now, I swear that we’re running it back,” said Masvidal.
“Let’s run it back. I don’t like to leave the ring like this with my opponent conscious. There’s only one way to do it and that’s to baptize them. I didn’t get to baptize Nate.



“We’re going to run it back. Don’t worry, its’s going to happen again.”
