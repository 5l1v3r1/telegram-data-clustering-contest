Senate adoption of House 2020 budget bill eyed
03 Nov 2019, 10:27 by Marlon Purificacion
SENATOR Panfilo Lacson is looking at the possibility of the Senate adopting the version of the 2020 budget bill approved by the House of Representatives to prevent congressmen from making further amendments.
Lacson said he already took this proposal up with Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, who both are already considering the suggestion.
Lacson confirmed that there is nothing irregular so far in the House-approved General Appropriations Bill.
He said the only changes he saw there are the P9.5-billion institutional amendments that Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano announced before transmitting the bill to the Senate.
However, he also noticed that there are “unclear” items in the National Expenditure Program but these cannot be considered “pork” allocations worth P20 billion as these were vetted by executive departments themselves.
“Kung wala namang maraming issues at pwedeng patawarin yung P20 billion at pwede nang ipaubaya sa DBM kung paano mai-realign, ang pinakamagandang gawin, dahil sa nakita namin na P9.5 billion lang na institutional amendments, baka mas magandang gawin namin i-adopt nalang yung House version,” he said.
”Kapag ganun, nganga yung mga may hawak na amendments para sa bicam. Kasi siyempre wala nang bicam kapag in-adopt namin yung House version,” Lacson added.
Lacson said senators have to keep an eye during the bicameral conference committee deliberations on the budget, as this is where congressmen could make their individual amendments.
“Kung totoo man na may kanya-kanya silang hawak o naisumite na sa appropriate chairman nila yung listahan ng mga gustong proyekto ng mga kongresista, malamang sa hindi, sa bicameral conference nila yun ilalatag o ipapasok,” he said.
“Yun ang delikado at yun ang kailangang bantayan ng Senado, at least yung magiging members ng bicam,” he added.
He also challenged congressmen to disclose to the public whether they would still make amendments to the budget during the bicameral conference committee.
“In the spirit of transparency, mas mainam na ipakita nila sa publiko, ia-announce na nila, ito yung aming mga individual amendments pa na hindi naisama doon sa third and final reading at nai-transmit na kopya sa Senado, para sa ganun maaral na rin namin para pagharap namin sa bicam, preparado kami,” he said.

He said the only changes he saw there were the P9.5-billion institutional amendments that Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano announced before transmitting the bill to the Senate.
However, he also noticed that there are ""unclear"" items in the National Expenditure Program but these cannot be considered ""pork"" allocations worth P20 billion as these were vetted by executive departments themselves.
“If there are not many issues and the P20 billion can be forgiven and the DBM can be left to be realized, the best thing to do, given that we have seen only P9.5 billion in institutional amendments, is that we might do better to adopt that's the House version, ”he said.
”Then, those who are holding amendments for bicam are surprised. Because of course there was no use when we adopted the House version, ”Lacson added.
Lacson said senators have to keep an eye during the bicameral conference committee deliberations on the budget, as this is where congressmen could make their individual amendments.
""Whether it's true that they hold or have already submitted to their appropriate chairman the list of congressional projectors, it is unlikely, at their bicameral conference, to be circulated or introduced,"" he said.
""That's dangerous and that's what the Senate needs to watch out for, and at least the bicam members,"" he added.
He also challenged congressmen to disclose to the public whether they would still make amendments to the budget during the bicameral conference committee.
“In the spirit of transparency, it is best to make it public, they will announce, it is our individual amendments that are not included in the third and final reading and transmitted copy to the Senate, for that purpose. well for us to deal with bicam, we are prepared, ”he said.
