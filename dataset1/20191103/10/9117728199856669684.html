        <b>Christian Horner believes the results in qualifying shows just how competitive the car has been in Austin so far this weekend. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> secured a third-place courtesy of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>, in qualifying while <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> came through in sixth.</b>
      </p>
