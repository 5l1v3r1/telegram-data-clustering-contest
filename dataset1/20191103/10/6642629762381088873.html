      <p>Last month, the country's High Court had set a November 7 deadline for him to appear in person.</p>
      <p>The Labour Court had earlier issued an arrest warrant for Yunus and two other executives after he failed to appear because he was abroad.</p>
      <p>The three employees filed the cases in July, saying they were terminated illegally after seeking to form a trade union.</p>
      <p>Grameen Communications, a not-for-profit information technology firm, is one of several companies under the Grameen umbrella founded by Yunus.</p>
      <p>Yunus shared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2017/10/grameen-bank-debt-trap-poor-171020082314218.html">Grameen Bank</a>, which provides small loans to impoverished people.</p>
      <p>He lost a legal battle after the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina removed him from the bank over retirement age regulations in 2011.</p>
      <p>A year earlier, in November 2010, Hasina claimed Yunus was "sucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation".</p>
      <p>In the following years, the authorities filed a criminal case against him for food adulteration, and initiated investigations into the bank and its sister companies.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the National Bureau of Revenue filed a court case against Yunus for allegedly failing to pay $1.5m in tax - an allegation he called "baseless". The case was subsequently stayed by the High Court.</p>
      <p>The move was seen by some observers as a possible new step in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/03/2011328141930555865.html">ruling Awami League party's ongoing feud</a> with Yunus, which was initially triggered by his attempt in 2007 to establish a rival political party.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has also accused him of lobbying the World Bank to stop its $3bn financing of a bridge over the Padma river at Mawa, 50km (30 miles) south of Dhaka, and this year said "the conspirators" seeking to block the grant "will be prosecuted".</p>
