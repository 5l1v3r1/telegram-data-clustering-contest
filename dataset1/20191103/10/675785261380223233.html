      <h1>Brits to continue MH370 search in Cambodian jungle despite near-fatal experience</h1>
      <h2>Ian Wilson is determined to resume his search after travelling to south east Asia with brother Jack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T10:53:45+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Burke</a></address>
      <p>A tenacious Brit convinced that missing flight MH370 is in the Cambodian jungle says he will resume his search - even though a previous attempt nearly proved deadly.</p>
      <p>Ian Wilson believes he spotted the Malaysia Airlines plane when looking at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> Maps.</p>
      <p>He travelled to the area with brother Jack last year - and Jack was lucky to survive a sudden fall after ground gave way underneath him.</p>
      <p>Despite this Ian is keen to return to the mountainous terrain.</p>
      <p>The video producer <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/mh370-cambodia-hunter-vows-search-20760337">told the Daily Star</a> that it was "so dangerous", and added: "We should have been badly injured, but the guides were good, they would go across first, and pull us up."</p>

      <p>He said Jack had been on a steep incline when the ground gave way, forcing him to "dive" and ending up in a tree.</p>
      <p>Ian said: "He was hanging on at one point, if he hand't have dived and hung onto that branch, he would have had a pretty steep fall."</p>
      <p>He is now determined to resume the search for the missing Boeing 777-2000, which vanished in March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
      <p>This is despite the impact it had on him personally.</p>

      <p>"I had a weird seizure the day after I came there, I thought I was having a stroke, all jittery and my heart was going, probably really bad dehydration," he said.</p>
      <p>Ian told the Daily Star he is hoping to get the money together for another trip to Cambodia.</p>
      <p>He began his quest after spotting a plane on Google Maps.</p>
      <p>However the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) is certain that the aircraft was captured mid-flight.</p>
      <p>Evidence is mounting that the crash, which has become of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time, was a murder-suicide.</p>
      <p>New flight data suggests "some abnormal turns [were] made by the 777 [that] can only be done manually."</p>

      <p>French investigators claim captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a troubled, lonely man who deliberately killed all passengers and crew on board the flight.</p>
      <p>But it will take around "a year" to go through all of the information received from Boeing, sources said in July.</p>
      <p>A source, who is "close to the investigation", said: "Some abnormal turns made by the 777 can only be done manually. So someone was at the helm.</p>

      <p>"It is too early to state categorically.</p>
      <p>"But nothing is credited that anyone else could have entered the cockpit."</p>
      <p>The informant told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/vol-mh370-revelations-sur-le-crash-mystere-10-07-2019-8114283.php">Le Parisien</a> the new development amid France's judicial inquiry into the crash. It is the only country to conduct one as of yet.</p>
