Hey guys.Today I show you how to create an mesh (bevel) along an bezier curve. It is very easy to create pipes or any other kind of organic round shapes (horns, tree trunk, ... ). I will explain how to do the setup and how to modify your curve for your needs.Maybe this will help you in any kind of way.Cheers!
