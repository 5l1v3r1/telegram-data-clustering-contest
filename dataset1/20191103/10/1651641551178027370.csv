BlizzCon Q&A featured a kid shouting for Hong Kong liberation
03 Nov 2019, 10:48 by Lewis White

BlizzCon 2019’s annual BlizzCon Q&A was broken up by one brave kid shouting for Hong Kong’s liberation. 

After the reveal of the new World of Warcraft expansion Shadowlands, Blizzard hosted a Q&A session for fans to learn more about the upcoming content.
During the panel, one fan was asked if they had anything else to say. “Uh, yeah,” the fan replied. “Free Hong Kong, Revolution of our Age.” It’s a short clip, but the host looks unsurprisingly shaken up. With Blizzard firing Hearthstone casters for Pro-player Blitzchung’s pro-revolution speech, it’s a dangerous position to be in.
The BlizzCon Q&A continues: directly after the questioner exits the frame, a child can be heard in the background. “Free Hong Kong,” the child chants. As another fan goes up to ask his question, the child continues, “Free Hong Kong, Free Hong Kong!”
The child eventually makes his way down to the camera, continually chanting.
“You got a question, mate?” The interviewer asks.
“Yeah,” the child replies. “Free Hong Kong.”



The video was posted on video game forum Resetera where a flood of gamers congratulated the child for speaking out against Blizzard.
“Whoever you are small child, bless your heart,” said user Hobbes. “Bless that kid for doing their best to fight the overwhelming impression that Blizzcon attendees are more offended by Blizzard making a mobile game to pander to China than by Blizzard punishing pro-democracy speech to pander to China,” says another.
With Blizzard’s censorship of Hong Kong protesters, those who support the revolution against China’s Communist Party have fired back. Protesters are now using Blizzard characters as political mascots, such as Overwatch’s Mei.
While many were part of the recent BoycottBlizzard push, many have already crawled back after the announcement of new content. “Well, I TRIED to have a break,” says one Twitter user.
