UFC 244 video recap: Jorge Masvidal wins ‘BMF’ title against Nate Diaz by unexpected doctor’s stoppage
03 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Harry Davies



The inaugural ‘BMF’ title fight between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz at UFC 244 ended in somewhat disappointing fashion, with the doctor stopping the fight at the end of the third round due to cuts around Diaz’s eye.

What was the high point of the fight?

Masvidal started off the fight by dropping Diaz in the first round with a big elbow followed by a head kick as he was going down. A cut opened up on the face of Diaz as he started to bleed heavily. In the second round Masvidal hurt Diaz with a body kick, and he continued to land some big hooks to the body which took a toll on Diaz.
As the third round ended with Masvidal on top of Diaz landing some ground and pound, the doctor decided to check up on the cut above Diaz’s eye. In a decision that took many by surprise, the doctor stopped the fight which sparked a wave of boo’s from the crowd, and the fight ended in a rather anti-climactic fashion.

Where do these two go from here?

The win for Masvidal means he is now the inaugural UFC ‘BMF’ champion, and given the way the fight ended it looks pretty likely he will be making the first (defense?) of his belt against Diaz as they will likely run the fight back.
Although Diaz said after the fight he wants to run it back as soon as possible, the cuts around his eye were quite deep, and they were the same ones he obtained in his decision win against Anthony Pettis in August. If the UFC is to book the rematch, they will have to wait until Diaz is fully fit and medically cleared to fight again.

Watch it now, later or never?

It was a fight that lived up to the billing, up until the doctor’s stoppage, watch it now.
