        <b>Irish U21 international Troy Parrott has been named on the Tottenham bench for the first time in the Premier League ahead of Spurs’ clash with Everton this afternoon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has never made a squad in the top flight for Spurs<a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1191014716178653185?s=20"> but is included among the substitutes for the game at Goodison Park.</a></p>
      <p>Tottenham captain Harry Kane did not travel with the squad for the game against Everton, who have also struggled at the start of the season, meaning <a href="https://punditarena.com/features/oisinmcqueirns2758/troy-parrott-tottenham-ireland/">Parrott</a> makes the bench while Lucas Moura comes into the side.</p>

      <p>Parrott’s involvement in the squad is also a big boost for his chances of winning his first senior Irish cap having been included in Mick McCarthy’s 39-man provisional squad named last week.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old is very highly rated at the North London club and according to<a href="https://twitter.com/Daily_Hotspur/status/1189162751039553537"> a report from David Ornstein in The Athletic,</a> Mauricio Pochettino is prepared to put his faith in youth, Parrott included, instead of adding to his squad in January.</p>
