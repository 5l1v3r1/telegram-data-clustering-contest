      <p>The incident came as riot police were patrolling several shopping centres in Hong Kong after hundreds of people had taken to the streets on Sunday in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911021077208417-hong-kong-rioters-vandalise-office-of-xinhua-news-agency-amid-ongoing-violence---reports/">another wave of protests</a>. The mass protests started in China's special administrative region in June in response to a highly unpopular bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to the mainland. Though the draft bill was eventually <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201909041076718624-hong-kong-chief-executive-to-announce-formal-withdrawal-of-extradition-bill---reports/">dropped</a> the protesters have since become more militant and are now demanding more radical changes in Hong Kong's policies.</p>
