（中央社記者游凱翔台北3日電）國防部今天表示，參考先進國家作法滾動調整，民國109年招募的志願役士兵，「脖子以上、手腕以下不得刺青」，已列入招募簡章。
刺青在過去被視為是幫派、黑幫的象徵，但隨著時代進步，刺青已逐漸成為潮流、藝術，因此只要不涉及幫派圖騰、不雅圖文等，國防部日前已放寬志願役士兵的刺青標準，但刺青範圍過大者仍不能夠加入國軍，但國防部近期參考先進國家等作法，刺青的規定將有所調整。
國防部官員今天表示，經過蒐集先進國家、警察機關及美軍的規定，已調整國軍官兵刺青規範，民國109年起招募的志願役士兵，「脖子以上、手腕以下不得刺青」，但已入營且有刺青的志願役士兵，並不需要清除既有刺青，也不會影響工作考核。
此外，報考三軍官校、專業軍士官班者仍不得刺青；三軍樂儀隊、政戰局、憲兵單位官兵刺青部位，則不得在穿著短袖、短褲時露出，相關規定已列入109年募兵簡章。（編輯：蘇志宗）1081103
