      <p>We can do it! But if you’re too lazy to do it and need to be verbally harassed to go <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-best-war-movies-on-netflix.html">kill some Nazis overseas</a>, please allow Barb, Norma, and Dot <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-hero-dog-sketch-with-cecily-strong-video.html">to change your mind</a>, a trio of slug-thumper BFFs who all happen to be in the running to become <i>the </i>face for America’s war-propaganda posters. They’re bawdy. They’re grotesque. They would absolutely drive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4dfuf69q_8">Colonel Klink</a> to the point of monocled insanity if they were given the chance to fulfill their German wartime dreams. “I’d take that Hitler and I would shove his head right up my ass until he was dead,” one opines. “I’d fight Hitler, I’d strip him naked, and march him across Poland with a Lucky Strike stuck between his cheeks.” It’s a shame they weren’t chosen as models. They would’ve gone nude.</p>
