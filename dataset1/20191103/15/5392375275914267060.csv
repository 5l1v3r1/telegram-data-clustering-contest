According to a recent report, Finnish manufacturer, HMD Global, is preparing a successor to the recently released Nokia 2.2. According to a distributor database, Nokia is preparing a new smartphone – Nokia 2.3. The name of this device suggests that it is the successor to the Nokia 2.2. While we are still trying to verify the authenticity of this information, a new report from NPU claims that Nokia 5.2 has passed through FCC with model number “TA-1214”.



According to the report, this smartphone comes with a dimension of 157.69 × 75.41mm and the display is about 6.1 inches. According to the report, there are currently three versions of the Nokia 5.2. While “TA-1206” is a dual card version, “TA-1214” is a single card version, and “TA-1211” currently has no information. In addition, “TA-1209” also got a certification in India. This smartphone comes with a 3920 mAh battery.
It is possible that Nokia will unveil the entry-level Nokia 2.3 and Nokia 5.2 together. As of now, there is no information on the configuration of the Nokia 2.3. However, there are speculations that it should come with MediaTek’s Helio A22, and Bluetooth may use 5.0. Generally, the specifications of Nokia 2.3 device should be similar to Nokia 2.2. The Nokia 5.2 should be a mid-range smartphone.
