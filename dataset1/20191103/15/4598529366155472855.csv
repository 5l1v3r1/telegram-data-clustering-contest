Trump Gets Booed At A Sporting Event Yet Again, But Also Met With Some Cheers

03 Nov 2019, 15:14

President Donald Trump’s second venture out to the public on Saturday night wasn’t much more successful than his first.
Trump and his two sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump attended UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York City with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Peter King (R-NY).
He was met with a deluge of boos from a large section of the audience.






After the game, Trump retweeted posts and a video claiming that the crowd was in fact cheering on the President.



Though at least Trump wasn’t met solely with a wave of boos this time, the mixed reception closely echoes the response he got exactly a week prior when hemade a surprise appearance at the World Series in D.C.
