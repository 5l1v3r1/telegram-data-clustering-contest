New York City Marathon: Jepkosgei tops Keitany in debut, Kamworor wins for second time
03 Nov 2019, 15:32 by Travis Fedschun
The 49th running of the New York City Marathon on Sunday was marked by a major upset on the women's side and the second win in two years on the men's.
Joyciline Jepkosgei, 25, of Kenya came out on top Sunday, winning the 2019 TCS New York City Marathon in her debut running in the race with an unofficial finish time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 38 seconds, seven seconds off the course record.
Jepkosgei overtook the reigning champion and countrymate Mary Keitany in the last half of the race who was attempting her fifth title in six years at the New York City Marathon The Kenyan pulled away from countrymate Keitany with about three miles to go. Four-time winner Keitany collapsed after finishing 53 seconds later.



A year ago, 37-year-old Keitany finished 17 seconds off the course record. Keitany had dominated the New York City Marathon since her first victory in 2014. She followed with two more consecutive titles, including a dominant conquest in 2016 when she won by more than 3 1/2 minutes and finished last year with her fastest mark yet, in 2 hours, 22 minutes, 48 seconds — not far off Maraget Okayo's 2:22:31 course record from 2003.
But it was Jepkosgei who pulled away on Sunday to become the youngest winner in New York since 25-year-old Margaret Okayo in 2001. She also won the New York City Half-Marathon in March and is the first runner to win both events.

On the men's side, reigning champion Lelisa Desisa dropped out of the New York City Marathon after completing just seven miles, perhaps hurting following a grueling victory at the sweltering world championships last month. That allowed Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya to win the men's division of the 2019 TCS New York City Marathon, his second time winning the race, with an unofficial finish time of 2 hours, 08 minutes, and 13 seconds.



He previously won the 2017 New York City Marathon.



Desisa, who is from Ethiopia, was in 17th place at the seven-mile mark before leaving the course on Sunday.

It was 45 degrees at the start of the men's race, ideal for marathoning.

Desisa was attempting to defend his title 29 days after winning worlds in Doha, Qatar, in boiling conditions he described this week as ""dangerous."" With a temperature of 84 degrees F for the midnight start, 18 of 73 men didn't finish that race.
Roughly 52,000 took to the streets of New York City on Sunday on the trek to the finish line in Central Park after winding through New York's five boroughs.
