      <p>SYDNEY: Australia looked on course to chase down a small target in their first T20 International against Pakistan before the game was called off due to rain on Sunday (Nov 3).</p>
      <p>Put into bat, Pakistan were 88 for three wickets in the 13th over when rain interrupted play.</p>

      <p>The match was subsequently reduced to 15-overs-a-side when the players returned and skipper Babar Azam made 59 not out to help Pakistan to a below-par 107-5.</p>
      <p>Counterpart Aaron Finch gave Australia a flying start with 37 runs from 16 balls as the hosts cruised to 41 for no loss in 3.1 overs.</p>
      <p>It was at that moment that rain returned to the Sydney Cricket Ground to dash Australia's hopes of going 1-0 up in the three-match series.</p>
      <p>"It's frustrating," Finch said afterwards.</p>
      <p>"To restrict them to 107 off 15 overs was a great effort and then to be on track to get them was nice."</p>
      <p>"It was nice to get a few out of the middle. Like I said, a bit unfortunate the rain played such a part."</p>
      <p>Canberra hosts the second match on Tuesday.</p>
