      <h1>Nolte: The Biggest, Dumbest, Woketard Plot Hole in 'Terminator: Dark Fate'</h1>
      <h2>I’ve had some second thoughts about the box office flop Terminator: Dark Fate...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T15:53:11+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">John Nolte</a></address>
      <p>Believe it or not, I go to the movies — every movie — looking to love that movie. This was certainly the case with <i>Terminator: Dark Fate, </i>especially with the return of Linda Hamilton. I was rooting for her. <i>Linda Hamilton</i> and <i>Terminator</i> make up the soundtrack of my life. Plus, I can’t imagine an existence where you walk into a theater with a chip on your shoulder, where you’re looking for any excuse to hate the movie.</p>
      <p>Because I resist this impulse, I tend to gloss over things, which is why my <i>Dark Fate</i> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/01/terminator-dark-fate-review-an-all-girl-remake-of-terminator-2/">review</a> is kinder than some others. Sometimes this glossing over technique works. Sometimes the gloss doesn’t hold, and after a few days I’m forced to admit, <i>Yeah, that was so awful it took me out of the movie, even though I tried to fool myself into pretending it didn’t.  </i></p>
      <p>So, here I am a couple of days later, removing a pebble in my shoe I can no longer ignore…</p>
      <p>Sadly, this particular pebble happens to be what should have been <i>Dark Fate’s</i> biggest hell-yeah moment: Sarah Connor’s (Hamilton) grand entrance in <i>Dark Fate</i>.</p>
      <p>Minor spoilers coming…</p>
      <p>One of the many questions <i>Dark Fate</i> has to answer is what Sarah Connor has been doing since 1991, since the end of <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</i></p>
      <p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/01/terminator-dark-fate-review-an-all-girl-remake-of-terminator-2/">my review</a>, it’s actually a cool answer. It turns out that before Skynet was destroyed in <i>T2</i>, they managed to send back a bunch of Terminators, stragglers if you will, and Connor’s dedicated her life to destroying them. Like I mentioned before, that’s a concept that might have made for a pretty cool movie: a stripped out, <i>Logan</i>-style, down-and-dirty genre feature… A weathered, aging, grieving, emotionally empty, alcoholic Sarah Connor roaming the world as a Terminator hunter. Sarah Connor is now a Terminator. If done right, I’d pay to see that twice.</p>
      <p>Instead, what we got was an empty, over-CGI’d, all-girl remake of <i>T2</i>, but I digress….</p>
      <p>Here’s the set-up…</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkF5a1ysYM">Androgynous Terminator</a> (Mackenzie Davis) and Half-Pint Diversity Hire (Natalie Reyes) are on the run from a Liquid Terminator (Gabriel Luna’s Rev-9) determined to kill the Half-Pint Diversity Hire because, you know, the future ‘n stuff. After a pretty solid chase sequence, they find themselves cornered on a highway overpass.</p>
      <p>They’re doomed.</p>
      <p>It’s over.</p>
      <p>When…</p>
      <p>Sarah Connor shows up out of nowhere in slow-mo to save the day. She hits the Liquid Terminator with some automatic fire and launched-grenades, and it falls over the side of the bridge.</p>
      <p>Situation totally in hand — because she’s apparently done this dozens of times — a bored-by-the tired-routine-of-killing-Terminators Sarah Connor pulls a pistol and tells Androgynous Terminator “I’ll be back.”</p>
      <p>She then proceeds down the hill to finish off the Terminator, and this is all total bullshit.</p>
      <p>First off, when Sarah hits the Liquid Terminator with the grenades, it reveals itself to her as a Liquid Terminator. So she knows this is a Liquid Terminator, and she’s not surprised it’s a Liquid Terminator, which tells us she has not only been hunting and killing T-800s (the Terminators played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), she has also been hunting and killing Liquid Terminators (T-1000s), like the one played so memorably by Robert Patrick in <i>T2.</i></p>
      <p>So how the hell did she plan to kill this thing with a handgun?</p>
      <p>Those of us who have seen <i>The Terminator</i> (1984) and <i>T2</i>, know how impossible it is to kill Terminators. Sarah barely survived Arnold’s T-800 in <i>T1</i>, and would not have had she not happened upon a factory with an industrial press. But this was nothing compared to what it took to kill the T-1000 in <i>T2</i>, and there she even had the help of Arnold’s T-800.</p>
      <p>So how exactly is Sarah Connor killing off Terminators all by herself now?</p>
      <p>Not only that, she’s 30-years older, and while I’m a decade younger than Hamilton, I can tell you that the physical difference between and a 53-year-old and a 33-year-old is significant. She’s 63.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a plot hole, it’s a plot canyon. We’re supposed to believe that 1) a Social Security-eligible Sarah Connor is out killing Terminators all on her own, and 2) she’s doing it with the conventional weapons that failed so miserably at stopping Patrick’s T-1000 in <i>T2</i>.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the filmmakers didn’t care because GRRRRRRL POWER. You see, Sarah no longer needs a man. Oh, no —  she’s killing Terminators all over the world all on her own by brandishing a gun and a vagina.</p>
      <p>This is not just terrible storytelling, it’s insulting to the intelligence.</p>
      <p>Honestly, how hard would it have been to have Sarah show up with a weapon she had developed over the last 30 years, a Terminator Killer, some gizmo that takes these things down easy peasy, except…</p>
      <p>Uh, oh… this Terminator is not like the Terminators I’ve been killing for 30 years… RUUUUNNNNN!!!!</p>
      <p>Imagine her having this weapon when she promises to kill Schwarzenegger’s T-800 later in <i>Dark Fate</i>. Instead of sounding ridiculous — 110 pound grandma’s gunna kill her a Terminator — with that in her pocket, it would have added an extra layer of tension, something this movie very much needed.</p>
      <p>So why didn’t they do that…?</p>
      <p>Well, it’s not because I have a better imagination than producer James Cameron or screenwriter David Goyer, two of the best storytellers in the business. That’s for sure…</p>
      <p>No, I think it was all about this woke-feminist garbage — this obnoxious, stupid nonsense that has Hollywood pandering to a handful of insecure, left-wing harpies on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Rather than make Sarah Connor’s back-story realistic, the message became more important than verisimilitude: Here’s a woman doing a job a man can’t, the job Kyle Reese and even the T-800 couldn’t do — killing Terminators all on her own.</p>
      <p>But, hey, geniuses… Where are all these pathetic, crybaby feminists you sought to appease? Where the hell are they? All that appeasement, and they still <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/02/woke-terminator-tanks-at-the-box-office/">didn’t show up</a> for opening weekend.</p>
      <p>And this is why I use the term “woketard.”</p>
      <p>Woke makes you stupid.</p>
