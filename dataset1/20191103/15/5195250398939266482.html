      <h3>The Imperiale 400 rivals directly against the RE 350 range of motorcycles and the recently introduced Jawa 300 and the Jawa 42</h3>
      <p>Royal Enfield dominated the retro classic segment of India until Jawa stepped into the scene last year. Jawa launched a total of two new bikes in 2018 that gave some tough competition to Royal Enfield. Recently Benelli introduced their first retro-styled motorcycle the Imperiale 400. The Imperiale 400 is the least expensive motorcycle launched by Benelli in India.</p>
      <p>The lower price tag was achieved due to heavy localization that itself is a huge achievement for the Chinese owned Italian two-wheeler manufacturer. The Benelli Imperiale 400 is priced at Rs 1.69 Lakh (ex-showroom) and here are the few other motorcycles that you can buy with that money</p>
      <h4>1. Royal Enfield Classic 350</h4>
