      <h1>Derrick Lewis after UFC 244 win: I want Greg Hardy out of the UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T15:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Milan Ordoñez</a></address>
      <p>Former title challenger and UFC heavyweight contender Derrick Lewis was candid about his dislike towards Greg Hardy. “The Black Beast” expressed his sentiments about the controversial heavyweight during a post-fight scrum after his decision win over Blagoy Ivanov at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>“I want Greg Hardy to get his ass out of the UFC,” Lewis told reporters. “He’s making everyone else look bad. So, we don’t need him to win no more fights.”</p>
      <p>Hardy hopped right back into action after UFC Boston in mid-October, as he takes on number-seven ranked contender Alexander Volkov in Moscow next weekend. Having locked horns with Volkov in the Octagon and winning via a come-from-behind knockout, Lewis isn’t counting on “The Prince of War” to win.</p>
      <p>“They got on to him now, so I don’t think his ass can <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/18/20921893/ufc-boston-greg-hardy-uses-inhaler-in-between-rounds-against-ben-sosoli-mma-news">bring an inhaler to the cage</a> to help him this time,” Lewis said of Hardy. “So I don’t think he’ll win.”</p>
      <p>Volkov and Hardy will co-headline UFC Moscow on November 9th. Headlining the event is a featherweight tiff between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar.</p>
