Irish U21 international Troy Parrott has been named on the Tottenham bench for the first time in the Premier League ahead of Spurs’ clash with Everton this afternoon.

The 17-year-old has never made a squad in the top flight for Spurs but is included among the substitutes for the game at Goodison Park.
Tottenham captain Harry Kane did not travel with the squad for the game against Everton, who have also struggled at the start of the season, meaning Parrott makes the bench while Lucas Moura comes into the side.



Parrott’s involvement in the squad is also a big boost for his chances of winning his first senior Irish cap having been included in Mick McCarthy’s 39-man provisional squad named last week.
The 17-year-old is very highly rated at the North London club and according to a report from David Ornstein in The Athletic, Mauricio Pochettino is prepared to put his faith in youth, Parrott included, instead of adding to his squad in January.
