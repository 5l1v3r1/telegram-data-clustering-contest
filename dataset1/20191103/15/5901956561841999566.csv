Na japonski gori Fudži so našli truplo pohodnika, za katerega utemeljeno sumijo, da je umrl med tem, ko je na družbenih omrežjih prenašal video v živo. Kot poročajo tuji mediji, je nesrečnežu verjetno spodrsnilo, nato pa je padel in obležal. Policija je ob izginotju pohodnika izvedla veliko iskalno akcijo. Upanje, da ga bodo našli živega, je kmalu usahnilo, saj so na nadmorski višini 2700 metrov našli moško truplo.Na videoposnetku, ki je nastal pred smrtjo, je moški dejal, da so mu prsti otrpnili od mraza in da si želi, da bi seboj vzel grelnike. Ravno ko je potožil, da je pot do vrha gore izredno spolzka in prekrita s snegom, je začel padati, nato pa se je snemanje prekinilo. 



Vpon na najvišjo goro na Japonskem je sicer dovoljen le od začetka julija do 10. septembra.
