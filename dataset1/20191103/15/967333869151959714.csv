At least four people have been injured in a knife attack in Hong Kong, according to reports by local media.
The attacker was subdued by people in the mall. His name has not yet been released.
According to some sources, a district councillor was among the injured.



The incident happened​ after the attacker had argued with a family over political issues, the South China Morning Post says. According to the paper, district councillor Andrew Chiu Ka-yin had his ear partially cut off during the brawl. He was sent to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in Chai Wan, a fellow councillor said as quoted by the South China Morning Post.

The incident came as riot police were patrolling several shopping centres in Hong Kong after hundreds of people had taken to the streets on Sunday in another wave of protests. The mass protests started in China's special administrative region in June in response to a highly unpopular bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to the mainland. Though the draft bill was eventually dropped the protesters have since become more militant and are now demanding more radical changes in Hong Kong's policies.
