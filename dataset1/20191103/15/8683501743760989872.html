      <p>Rian Johnson is a divisive figure for <i>Star Wars</i> fans. As director of <i>The Last Jedi</i>, he faced an onslaught of backlash from those who weren’t thrilled with the narrative choices. News that he’d been tasked with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480387/rian-johnson-explains-the-timing-of-his-star-wars-trilogy">creating a new series of <i>Star Wars</i> films</a> wasn’t met with the warmest reception from those who already had issues with him -- and we’ve had a confusing mix of information about the status of that project ever since. And now appears that even the director is waiting to find out whether they are happening or not.</p>
      <p>While promoting <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482002/knives-outs-opening-weekend-could-be-bigger-than-expected">his new film <i>Knives Out</i></a>, Rian Johnson spoke with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/rian-johnson-star-wars-talks-knives-out-last-jedi-twitter-inspiration-1202775691/">Deadline</a>. He addressed the “angry” tweets he endured after <i>The Last Jedi</i>, before speaking to where he stands with his next <i>Star Wars</i> endeavor. He told the magazine:</p>
      <blockquote>We’re still engaged with Lucasfilm and we’ll wait and see. No updates on it at this moment, but yeah.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s not the first vague comment Rian Johnson has made about his future with the franchise. But it’s at least a <i>little</i> more concrete than some of his previous remarks. In October, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481963/wait-is-rian-johnsons-star-wars-trilogy-not-a-sure-thing">he dropped an “if”</a> when discussing his next steps with <i>Star Wars</i> in an interview with Bang Showbiz (he <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483034/dont-worry-rian-johnson-is-still-working-on-his-star-wars-movies">later clarified</a> that he thinks it’s less of an ‘if’ and more of a ‘when’).</p>
      <p>But, to be fair, it seems like a <i>lot</i> is up in the air where <i>Star Wars</i> is concerned these days. In addition to the backlash surrounding <i>The Last Jedi</i>, the standalone <i>Solo</i> failed to impress at the box office, which seems to have caused Disney to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2438599/could-disney-be-pressing-pause-on-star-wars-spinoffs">put similar projects on hold</a>. Fans can still anticipate the end of the nine-part epic Skywalker saga this December. But after <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> and <i>The Mandalorian</i>, it’s difficult to tell where they will go next.</p>
      <p>Upheaval outside of Rian Johnson’s role in the franchise has only made things more confusing. <i>Game of Thrones</i> showrunners D.B Weiss and David Benioff were on deck to create their own series of <i>Star Wars</i> films. But they <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483534/game-of-thrones-creators-reportedly-left-star-wars-over-fear-of-toxic-fandom">ended their relationship with Lucasfilm</a> somewhat abruptly (allegedly due to concerns about facing another fervent fandom). And <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483691/disneys-bob-iger-says-star-wars-movies-are-special-and-less-is-more">Disney CEO Bob Iger</a> has made it pretty clear he thinks they goofed in throwing so many <i>Star Wars</i> projects at fans in such quick succession.</p>
      <p>In other words, if Rian Johnson is in the dark about <i>Star Wars</i>’ long-term future, he’s probably not the only one. For his part, the director has weathered the controversy surrounding <i>The Last Jedi</i>. He’s fiercely defended the creative decisions he made. And when <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>’s trailer dropped, he proved that even if he's in 'wait and see' mode with his own <i>Star Wars</i> projects, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482897/rian-johnson-had-the-best-response-to-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalkers-final-trailer">he can still geek out</a> with the best of us.</p>
