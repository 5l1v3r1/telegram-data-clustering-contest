Vinnie was the hero of the hour, and moved to help diner Norman ahead of paramedics arriving by performing CPR.
A source told The Sun : ""Everyone was panicking when the bloke started choking but Vinnie ran over to help.
""His CPR training came flooding back. He was a real superhero.
""Norman’s family contacted Vinnie that night to thank him for saving his life.""
 
Tragically, despite Norman being revived by Vinnie, he sadly passed away four days later.
In 2012, Vinnie starred in an NHS advert which demonstrated how to perform hands-only CPR.
 
In the advert, Vinnie said: ""There really shouldn't be any messing about when it comes to CPR. If you're worried about the kiss of life just forget it and push hard and fast in the centre of the chest to Stayin' Alive.
""Hands-only CPR should give have-a-go heroes the confidence to step in and help when somebody is in cardiac arrest.""
