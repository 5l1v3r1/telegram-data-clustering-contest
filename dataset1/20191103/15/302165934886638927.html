      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 3 — Some 300 to 400 Singaporeans today held a rare rally in a park against the government’s immigration policies, a hot button issue likely to figure in a parliamentary election expected in the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>The People’s Action Party (PAP), which has ruled since independence in 1965, suffered its worst showing ever in the 2011 elections, in part due to voter concern over immigration.</p>
      <p>Around 40 per cent of the 5.7 million people living on the small city-state are foreign and some Singaporeans are frustrated with the number of immigrants in the city-state, who they accuse of competing for jobs, housing and schooling.</p>
      <p>“Singaporeans, it is time to stand up for your rights to a reasonably good job in our own country — we must always adhere to the Singaporean-first slogan and that employment must be given to a local first before we ever consider a foreigner,” Gilbert Goh, the organiser of today’s protest, said in a Facebook post for the event.</p>
      <p>Posters reading messages including “We want a Singapore first labour policy” were placed around Speakers’ Corner, a designated site for people to air their views in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Many protesters listened to speeches from plastic chairs, some sipping cups of malted milk, while a few waved the Singapore flag.</p>
      <p>Public dissent is rare in Singapore where a licence is required to hold a demonstration.</p>
      <p>The government has been tightening the inflow of foreign labour over the last few years.</p>
      <p>Today’s protest followed a viral video showing a man of Indian descent swearing at an elderly local security guard at his condominium complex late last month. Local media reported the man was a naturalised Singapore citizen.</p>
      <p>Singapore’s trade and manpower ministries did not respond to emailed requests for comment outside business hours. — Reuters</p>
