Odinga anchored his sentiments on his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying, “A vote for Okoth is a vote for unity … without unity, there can never be development.”
At the DC’s grounds, leaders affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto pitched camp, among them Kikuyu legislator Kimani Ichung’wa and National Assembly Leader of Majority Adan Duale.
DP Ruto said with Mariga, Kibra stands a better chance to eliminate poverty after decades of being in the opposition.
“Raila has joined the Government through a bridge called handshake, why does he want you to be left in the opposition?” he asked thousands of Kibra residents, who attended the rally.
He highlighted some of the projects the National Government intends to undertake in Kibra, saying already much work was done by the National Youth Service, during the Jubilee Government first term.
“Vote for Mariga and he will join the President and myself to work for you,” he said.
Mariga has committed to ensure proper use of Kibra’s Constituency Development Fund, in a bid to build on the late Ken Okoth’s legacy.
According to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), there are 118,658 registered voters in Kibra.
