      <p>President Donald Trump’s second venture out to the public on Saturday night wasn’t much more successful than his first.</p>
      <p>Trump and his two sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump attended UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden in New York City with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Peter King (R-NY).</p>
      <p>He was met with a deluge of boos from a large section of the audience.</p>

      <p>After the game, Trump retweeted posts and a video claiming that the crowd was in fact cheering on the President.</p>

      <p>Though at least Trump wasn’t met solely with a wave of boos this time, the mixed reception closely echoes the <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-boos-lock-him-up-nationals-astros-game">response</a> he got exactly a week prior when he<br/>made a surprise appearance at the World Series in D.C.</p>
