        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 3 – Kibra constituency pulsated on Sunday afternoon, as the scramble for votes intensified, on the eve of  campaigns deadline, Monday and ahead of the November 7 by-election .</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The main rallies were those of Jubilee’s candidate McDonald Mariga at the DC’s grounds, while Imran Okoth of the Orange Democratic Movement was in Woodley.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>In the ODM rally, Raila Odinga led a team that cut across the political divide, with among the notable leader’s present being Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, among others.</p>
      <p>Also present was Governors Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni).</p>
      <p>“I urge Kibra residents to cast their votes carefully since this by-election is bigger than you can imagine,” MP Kamanda said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Odinga anchored his sentiments on his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying, “A vote for Okoth is a vote for unity … without unity, there can never be development.”</p>
      <p>At the DC’s grounds, leaders affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto pitched camp, among them Kikuyu legislator Kimani Ichung’wa and National Assembly Leader of Majority Adan Duale.</p>
      <p>DP Ruto said with Mariga, Kibra stands a better chance to eliminate poverty after decades of being in the opposition.</p>
      <p>“Raila has joined the Government through a bridge called handshake, why does he want you to be left in the opposition?” he asked thousands of Kibra residents, who attended the rally.</p>
      <p>He highlighted some of the projects the National Government intends to undertake in Kibra, saying already much work was done by the National Youth Service, during the Jubilee Government first term.</p>
      <p>“Vote for Mariga and he will join the President and myself to work for you,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mariga has committed to ensure proper use of Kibra’s Constituency Development Fund, in a bid to build on the late Ken Okoth’s legacy.</p>
      <p>According to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), there are 118,658 registered voters in Kibra.</p>
