      <h1>Twitter Amused as Children Allegedly Told to ‘Build the Wall’ at White House Halloween Party</h1>
      <h2>A White House Halloween party on 25 October had been conceived as an interactive and inspiring child-friendly event, built around the theme: “When I grow up I want to be…”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:25:20+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">by Svetlana Ekimenko</a></address>
      <p>A Halloween party which took place in an office building used by White House staff and included families of executive-branch employees and VIP guests had all the attributes of a kid-friendly event: candy and paper airplanes, interactive displays and … a station where children were supposedly encouraged to help “Build the Wall” with their own personalised bricks.</p>
      <p>Photos of the children’s mural with the paper wall were made public by Yahoo News.</p>

      <p>​“Horrified. We were horrified,” was the response quoted from a person who attended the event and requested anonymity.</p>
      <p>The Eisenhower Executive Office Building stands across from the White House and houses a large number of West Wing support staff and is home to the vice president’s ceremonial office.</p>
      <p>The “Build the Wall” mural was on the first floor, and featured red paper bricks, each bearing the name of a child.</p>
      <p>Large letters on the display spelled out “Build the Wall.”</p>
      <p>The children, dressed as superheroes and ninjas, were given brick-coloured paper cards and instructed to write their name with a marker and tape them to the wall.</p>
      <p>Alongside the paper wall were signs including one that read “America First.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Halloween party, offices inside the EEOB had been instructed to assemble interactive and inspiring kid-friendly displays for trick-or-treaters, addressing the party’s theme: “When I grow up I want to be…”</p>
      <p>Needless to say, there was a considerable social media backlash after the photos of the mural went viral.</p>
      <p>Some social media users saw nothing wrong with the interactive game the party offered the youngsters:</p>

      <p>​Some made sarcastic reference to little progress in Donald Trump’s border wall project.</p>

      <p>​Other social media users found the interactive game totally inappropriate and deplorable.</p>

      <h3>Trump's Promise to Build the Wall</h3>
      <p>In 2015, Donald Trump <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908281076665395-trump-lashes-out-at-wapo-denies-fake-story-about-presidential-pardon-for-illegal-border-wall-orders/">campaigned on a pledge to build an “impenetrable and beautiful” wall</a> along the entire 3,150-kilometre-long Mexico border an addition to existing structures, to stop illegal migrants from crossing into the US and crack down on crime.</p>
      <p>However, after Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2018 mid-term election, Trump found himself <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201905251075323770-us-judge-trump-money-emergency-wall/">incapable of securing</a> the $5.7 billion he said he required for the barrier to be built.</p>
      <p>Despite major setbacks when differences with Democratic lawmakers resulted in a month-long partial shutdown of government agencies, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border three weeks later in a move that enabled him to divert military funds toward the wall project.</p>
      <p>The US President is seeking to build some 400 miles of border wall by next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201905241075288216-trump-border-wall-firm/">Trump touted the wall</a> as “virtually impenetrable” when he visited a construction site close to San Diego in September, according to NBC News.</p>
