      <p>Harry Kane is out of Tottenham's clash at Everton through illness.</p>
      <p>In a huge blow for Spurs, their talismanic striker will miss the game with Lucas Moura set to step in up front.</p>
      <p>The England captain has started the season in good form, despite his side's tribulations in the first months of the campaign.</p>
      <p>He has 10 goals in 13 matches in all competitions and has already found the net on six occasions in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Spurs go into the game at Goodison Park 13th in the Premier League but could jump up to eighth with three points.</p>

      <p>The Toffees are in even greater strife, sitting just one place above the relegation zone and with boss Marco Silva under huge pressure.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate is set to be at Goodison with Dele Alli among those looking to catch the eye of the England boss.</p>
      <p>On criticism of Alli so far this term, Mauricio Pochettino said: "We need to remember that Dele is still so young and the demand and the pressure on him is massive.</p>
      <p>“Everyone expects big things from him but he’s only 23 years old. OK, he’s now dropped a little bit but we need to help and back him.”</p>
      <p>Youngster Ryan Sessegnon is part of Spurs' squad for the first time since signing from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> in the summer after overcoming a hamstring injury.</p>
