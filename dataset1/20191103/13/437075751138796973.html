      <p>An Overberg mechanic says his testicles were shattered when he and a burglar were wrestling for possession of a firearm and it suddenly went off.</p>
      <p>Murandi (MC) Fletcher says doctors warn he will be infertile after the incident, but he is glad that at least his “big weapon is still intact”.</p>
      <p>However, besides the nagging pain in his “crown jewels”, MC has another concern.</p>
      <p>He and his wife, Annelise, have had to deny rumours in the fertile Elgin Valley over the past week and in a tabloid newspaper that Annelise actually shot him for being “naughty”.</p>
      <p>On Friday, in their log home next to the Viljoenshoop road, the couple explained in elaborate detail what “really happened” last Sunday night.</p>
      <p>MC is a former security guard. He says a bullet pierced his neck in a robbery in the Free State in 2003.</p>
      <p>He showed City Press the injury, saying he was never treated for the post-traumatic stress he suffered after the incident.</p>
      <p>As he chatted, he lit up a cigarette and walked up and down the cramped, dimly-lit room with its large fish tank, memorabilia and birdcage with parakeets.</p>
      <p>Annelise began to explain what really took place on Sunday night just before 8pm.</p>
      <p>It was raining at the time.</p>
      <p>“Outside the house, a boerboel and a Rottweiler were on patrol. In the house were the two domestic dogs and six cats,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We were still waiting for one cat to come in, so the sliding door was open.”</p>
      <p>An Overberg mechanic says his testicles were shattered when he and a burglar were wrestling for possession of a firearm and it suddenly went off.</p>
      <p>She and her 13-year-old daughter, who was wearing headphones, were in a room.</p>
      <p>MC’s bookkeeper, who lives in a back room of the house, was in the shower.</p>
      <p>“MC was standing here at the kitchen,” said Annelise.</p>
      <p>“I was a few ‘paraffins’ down,” interjected MC. “Brandy. All the lights were off, except the TV.”</p>
      <p>According to Annelise, she heard “something”.</p>
      <p>“I thought: ‘What the f**k’s going on!? It’s probably MC shooting rats with the pellet gun.’”</p>
      <p>Annelise said that, as she entered the front room, MC stood there.</p>
      <p>“He just said: ‘Someone was here.’ I said: ‘Don’t talk sh*t to me!’</p>
      <p>“When I looked down, I saw blood coming out of the legs of his shorts. He wasn’t even aware he was bleeding.</p>
      <p>“He then said: ‘The guy had a black ski mask on, with holes for the eyes. He was wearing branded sneakers, with luminous markings.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone now – he slammed the door shut.’”</p>
      <p>MC again intervened to continue relating the story.</p>
      <p>“I just looked at him. Then I grabbed his hand and pushed it down. Then the shot went off.”</p>
      <p>Annelise said her husband “was hit in the ball bag. The bullet just missed his big ‘weapon’.”</p>
      <p>The couple then called a “lady” they knew who is a psychologist, and she called the police. MC was taken to Worcester Hospital by ambulance.</p>
      <p>Police apparently could not find the bullet in the house later.</p>
      <p>“The doctors took out the bullet,” said MC. “They say I can’t father children any more.</p>
      <p>“They also say my voice is going to change and my beard’s going to change... and that I’m going to become depressed.</p>
      <p>“It’s not something new to me. After the first shooting in 2003, I’m not afraid of anything or anybody.”</p>
      <p>Annelise said she was “very cross” about the rumours that she had shot her husband.</p>
      <p>“We’re telling you now: we’re going to get legal advice,” she said.</p>
      <p>MC added nothing more to the story, but stroked his beard calmly.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Mihlali Majikela says a charge of attempted murder is being investigated.</p>
      <p>“Circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated.</p>
      <p>“No one has been arrested yet,” he says.</p>
