        <b>Services have been held in memory of the 39 Vietnamese victims found dead in a lorry container in Essex.</b>
      </p>
      <p>More than 100 people attended the service at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the 39 died "seeking freedom, dignity and happiness".</p>
      <p>At Mass on at the same church on Sunday Bishop Nicholas Hudson also asked for prayers for traffickers.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed by police on Friday that all of those who were found were Vietnamese. Police had initially believed they were Chinese.</p>

      <p>At the service on Saturday evening, prayers were heard and members of the Catholic congregation performed readings and candles were lit.</p>
      <p>"We show our condolences and sympathies for the people who have lost their lives on the way seeking freedom, dignity and happiness," said Mr Nguyen.</p>
      <p>"We ask God to welcome them into his kingdom even though some of them were not Catholic but they strongly believed in eternal peace, so we pray for them."</p>
      <p>After the service he said: "The people here are very united because we are all refugees.</p>
      <p>"All the people here - most of the Vietnamese - came here as refugees in the '70s and the '80s and the '90s."</p>

      <p>He said in those decades, the disappearances of people from Vietnam were "not reported by the media, but many of them died".</p>
      <p>"These victims [who died in the lorry last month], this tragedy, was reported but many tragedies to the Vietnamese no-one [knows about]," he said.</p>
      <p>A memorial Mass on Sunday began with a projection of the trailer containing the bodies being removed from the industrial estate.</p>
      <p>After a minute's silence, Bishop Hudson said the service was to pray for the relations of congregation members who could be among the dead.</p>
      <p>He also asked for prayers for the emergency service staff who attended the scene.</p>
      <p>Bishop Hudson also sought prayers for traffickers, who he hoped "as a result of this tragedy may have had a change of heart".</p>
      <p>About 7% of Vietnam's population class themselves as Catholic, although the figure is higher in the area of the country where many of the missing people come from.</p>
      <p>In the past some Catholics <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8278336.stm">have had a fractious relationship</a> with Vietnam's communist government.</p>

      <p>Essex Police said it was now in "direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK" and the Vietnamese Government.</p>
      <p>A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead.</p>
      <p>Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her "trip to a foreign land has failed".</p>
      <p>The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead.</p>
      <p>Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of their deaths.</p>

      <p>The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50221753">Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland</a>, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.</p>
