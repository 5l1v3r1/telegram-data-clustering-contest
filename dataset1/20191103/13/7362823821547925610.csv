Her mother, Sharlene Parze, told News 12 the 25-year-old's phone and car were found at Parze's house.
""She would never go out of the house without her phone,"" her mother told News 12 New Jersey. ""Everything is just not her. You know, and I had just left her. And she was supposed to text me when she got home and she never did, but we know that she made it home because her car was in the driveway.""

Family members said that they knew something was wrong when the 25-year-old didn't show up to work the next day.
Stephanie's father, Ed Parze, told WCBS-TV it's not like his daughter, the oldest of four children, to just go without contacting anyone.
""Your mind is racing and you don’t know where she is,” he told WCBS.
