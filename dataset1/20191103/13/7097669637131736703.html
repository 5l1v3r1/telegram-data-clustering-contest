      <h1>Warren-Biden Gap Narrows in ABC/Wash Post Poll: Campaign Update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:51:16+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Niluksi Koswanage</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Senator Elizabeth Warren narrowed the gap with former Vice President Joe Biden in primary preferences for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday. Biden is seen as the stronger leader of the two, though, with the best chance of defeating President Donald Trump in 2020.</p>
      <p>His support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents was unchanged at 27% in the survey conducted Oct. 27-30 compared with one in early September, while Warren’s rose to 21% from 17%. Senator Bernie Sanders’ support held steady at 19%.</p>
      <p>The survey also showed support rising for Pete Buttigieg and falling for California Senator Kamala Harris. Voters voiced some health concerns over Sanders, who had a heart attack last month; they were split on the question about whether he’s “healthy enough to be president.”</p>
      <p>Backing for Harris slipped to 2% from 7% in September and 11% in July. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had 7% support, up three percentage points since early September.</p>
      <p>Some 1,003 adults were surveyed by Lander Research Associations. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.</p>
      <p>COMING UP</p>
      <p>Democratic candidates, including Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, continue to hold events Sunday in Iowa, home to the first 2020 nominating contest.</p>
