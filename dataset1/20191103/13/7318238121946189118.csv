Tiny, privately owned satellites are changing how we view the Earth

SAN FRANCISCO — In recent months, satellite photos have streamed into a former textile factory here revealing a build-up of potentRussian air defense systems in Ukraine, a serious new threat to NATO aircraft.This is not a secret CIA facility, and the images didn't come from a billion-dollar surveillance satellite.They were taken by private spacecraft — some the size of a loaf of bread — operated by Planet Labs, a Silicon Valley company that is leading a revolution in how humans glimpse Earth from space.A short stroll from the downtown San Francisco headquarters of Yelp and LinkedIn, Planet operates the largest and least expensive fleet of satellites in history — the first to take pictures of the entire landmass of the globe, once a day, and sell them to the public. The company is part of a fast-growing commercial satellite industry that is democratizing insights once available mainly to people with Top Secret government security clearances.In May, one of Planet's satellites captured a white plume of smoke from an illegal North Korean missile test, an image that rocketed through the next day's news cycle, undercutting President Donald Trump's insistence that the North Korean regime is negotiating with the U.S. in good faith.

""I think it's so important that the pictures don't lie,"" said Will Marshall, one of Planet's co-founders and a former NASA spacecraft designer. ""The picture is what it is. And sometimes that can be inconvenient. But it also will help us to transition away from this post-truth world, towards one more grounded in facts.""The U.S. intelligence community is a Planet customer, but so are environmental groups, farmers, Wall Street traders and journalists. Planet's fleet of imaging satellites documentsclimate change, natural disasters, the growth of refugee camps and the number of cars in the parking lots of a national retail chain.When floods inundated Western Iowa in March, state officials didn't have a handle on the severity of the damage until they saw Planet's overhead imagery. They say the data helped them better coordinate the response.As last year's Camp fire raged across California, Planet's imagery helped officials decide where to send firefighting crews.#embed-20190815-iowa-flood-slider iframe {width: 1px;min-width: 100%}
""Earthquakes, fires, floods, typhoons, tsunamis… We can help, because we have an image the day before, an image afterwards, to help responders quickly get in there,"" Marshall said.The first spy satellites weighed nearly a ton and sent back pictures by dropping giant film canisters into passing airplanes. These days the most sophisticated government photo satellites can be the size of a school bus, and cost billions.Marshall and his partners built their first satellite in a garage, applying the principles of the smart phone, stuffing a sophisticated camera and telescope into a rectangular box that weighs as much as a bowling ball.Then they began blasting dozens of them into space at a time, piggybacking on commercial launches of larger satellites.Planet won't say how much each one costs to make, except that it's ""orders of magnitude"" cheaper than traditional satellites.Commercial imaging satellites are not new; Americans have been looking at pictures from space of their houses on Google maps for years.

That is so much data that customers are turning to artificial intelligence to make sense of it. That technology is in its infancy, which means this could be the beginning of a new age of insights about the Earth. One day, there could be enough satellites in orbit to provide total persistent overhead coverage — an-on demand photo of any spot on the earth at any time, weather permitting.Other U.S. commercial satellite firms, including BlackSky and Maxar, operate more expensive satellites with better resolution than Planet's, but they don't have as many in orbit.Planet's small satellites stay in orbit only two or three years before burning up as they fall form the sky. So the company is constantly building more of them, with newer and better technology.""Last year we built roughly as many satellites as the whole world put together, outside of us, here in this little lab in San Francisco,"" Marshall said.The company, which has yet to go public, is now valued at $2 billion.As with any surveillance technology, the proliferation of commercial imagery can be put to ill use, by both governments and the private sector. The U.S. government limits the resolution of commercial satellite photos to ensure American spies still have the best pictures, and so the satellites cannot be used to snap close-ups of backyard sunbathers.
