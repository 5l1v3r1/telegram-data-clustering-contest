      <p>One person was killed and a further 91 wounded in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad as ongoing protests turned violent on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of Iraqis held a mass anti-government rally, occupying the central Tahrir Square and blocking roads to a major port.</p>
      <p>The wave of demonstrations is the biggest since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Protesters are demanding the removal of what they see as a corrupt political elite, and more jobs and better services.</p>
      <p>"We want our rights for we don't have any, no jobs or work," claimed one protester. "Privileges are only for the (political) parties."</p>
      <p>Protests have accelerated dramatically in recent days, drawing huge crowds from across sectarian and ethnic divides.</p>

      <p>They have been comparatively peaceful by day, becoming more violent after dark as police use tear gas and rubber bullets to battle self-proclaimed "revolutionary" youths.</p>
      <p>More than 250 people were killed in October.</p>
      <p>The government of Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, which has only been in office for one year, has so far failed to come up with an adequate response to the protests.</p>
