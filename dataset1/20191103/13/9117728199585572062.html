      <p>During the winter, they'll close the circuit to get started on the work. On Friday, they frantically tried to fix the problem and smooth the tarmac, but this proved impossible.</p>

      <p>Prior to the MotoGP race held earlier this year, part of the circuit has already been tackled, which should have been sufficient to also drive the GP of America without problems in F1 cars. Something that Epstein acknowledges is underestimated.</p>
