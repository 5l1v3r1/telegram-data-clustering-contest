      <p>"She would never go out of the house without her phone," <a href="http://newjersey.news12.com/story/41263533/family-searches-for-freehold-woman-last-seen-wednesday">her mother told News 12 New Jersey</a>. "Everything is just not her. You know, and I had just left her. And she was supposed to text me when she got home and she never did, but we know that she made it home because her car was in the driveway."</p>

      <p>"Your mind is racing and you don’t know where she is,” he told WCBS.</p>
