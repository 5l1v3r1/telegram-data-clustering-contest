      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Hunter Ehnstrom's face is one of pure inspiration.</p>
      <p>Hunter turned one year old in September, but his story of overcoming a challenge goes back before he was born.</p>
      <p>During his mother's pregnancy, doctors discovered Hunter had spina bifida, which usually means the person affected will never have use of their lower extremities.</p>
      <p>But doctors performed an amazing fetal surgery.</p>
      <p>They removed him from his mom's womb before birth to correct the condition, then placed him back for the rest of the pregnancy.</p>
      <p>It's a true medical miracle, and today Hunter is on the move.</p>
      <p>"We're very fortunate that he does have full movement all the way down to his toes," said Rebecca Ehnstrom.</p>
      <p>It's clear that both Hunter and his big brother, Austin, are loving bundles of joy.</p>
      <p>Watching all of his son's struggles, Bryan Ehnstrom decided to take on a challenge of his own: running the TCS NYC Marathon.</p>
      <p>"To me it was like, if he can handle all that, why can't I handle 26.2 miles?" he said.</p>
      <p>"Having the boys and Hunter as his inspiration of it, I just want to stand by him and support him for it," said Rebecca.</p>
      <p>Bryan's passion for running and his love of family has inspired his students to get on the move at the Hudson County schools of technology.</p>
      <p>"I actually want to go to the marathon and support him," said student Alexandra Roque. "We were thinking about having all of the runner's club go over there and support him."</p>
      <p>"I appreciate the fact that he's actually taking the time out of his day to still give his best level to us as a teacher," said Omar Salgado, another student.</p>
      <p>Bryan says he keeps his family in mind while running.</p>
      <p>"In my head I just kept saying, 'Hunter. Spina bifida.' Like, what he's going through is so much harder than anything I'm doing. Hunter and Austin are the two happiest kids that I know. I love them so much."</p>
