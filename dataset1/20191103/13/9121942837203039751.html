      <p>OLYMPIA — Washington officials are scrambling to notify roughly 1,000 people to check their voter registration status ahead of Tuesday’s election, after discovering a glitch last week that prevented the proper transfer of some new voter information.</p>
      <p>The issue occurred with potential voters registering at <a href="https://www.wahealthplanfinder.org/_content/Homepage.html?bmctx=B1EF2C76C22FC823F3BC4BBDAD8CA2C823B2A98DCF1D66A14F235198F62516A8&amp;contextType=external&amp;username=string&amp;password=secure_string&amp;challenge_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wahealthplanfinder.org%2F_content%2FHomepage.html&amp;request_id=-4440254766616480572&amp;authn_try_count=0&amp;locale=en_US&amp;resource_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.wahealthplanfinder.org%253A443%252FHBEWeb%252F">Washington’s health plan website</a>, which provides an option to register when people sign up for health or dental coverage.</p>
      <p>That’s a new program available this year — <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-is-adding-same-day-voter-registration-will-it-boost-turnout/">along with same-day voter registration</a> — courtesy of legislation lawmakers approved in 2018.</p>
      <p>Last week, during a regular audit of voter information, the Secretary of State’s Office discovered that voter-registration numbers from the health plan looked a little off, according to Assistant Secretary of State Mark Neary.</p>
      <p>Officials say they believe the problem started when the Washington Health Benefit Exchange underwent a system upgrade in August. At that time, health officials changed the destination at the Secretary of State’s Office for where they were sending new voter registrations as a precaution for the upgrade.</p>
      <p>After the upgrade, that destination wasn’t changed back. So information was getting transmitted to the Secretary of State’s Office — but to the wrong account.</p>

      <p>Michael Marchand, spokesman for the Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the health plan website, said no personal information was compromised.</p>
      <p>“None of the data ever left a safe and secure environment,” Marchand said. “It’s kind of like if you put a file in the wrong file cabinet.”</p>
      <p>Officials at the Health Benefit Exchange have been calling and emailing people potentially affected through the weekend so they can check their voter status, he added.</p>
      <p>Election officials were able to mail out roughly 300 ballots Friday to some of those impacted, according to Neary.</p>
      <p>Officials waited until Friday night to publicly announce the issue, Neary said, because they were still determining that day how many people were affected.</p>
      <p>Anyone unsure of their voter status should check it at <a href="https://voter.votewa.gov/WhereToVote.aspx">VoteWA.gov</a>, or contact their county elections office.</p>

      <p>The glitch was discovered just days before Tuesday’s election. Ballots were mailed to voters in mid-October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-times-2019-voter-guide/">Voters this year will decide upon</a> a slew of local elections, including high-profile Seattle City Council races, as well as statewide measures on car-tab fees, affirmative action and a state constitutional amendment on government contingency plans in the face of a widespread disaster.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of State’s website <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-state-voters-guide-website-down-days-before-election/">also experienced an outage that brought down its website</a> this weekend, including its online voter pamphlet, according to Secretary of State’s Office spokeswoman Kylee Zabel.</p>
      <p>The outage, which was discovered at about 2:20 p.m. Saturday, happened after a construction crew inadvertently dug up and cut a fiber cable, affecting multiple state agencies.</p>
      <p>The problem was fixed and the statewide voter pamphlet and the Secretary of State’s website were back up by 1 a.m. on Sunday, according to Zabel.</p>
      <p>During the outage, citizens should still have been able to access the voter pamphlet through county election websites via <a href="https://voter.votewa.gov/WhereToVote.aspx">VoteWa.gov</a>.</p>
      <p>Vote WA, which is an updated and more centralized statewide voter-registration and elections system, is another new feature this year.</p>
      <p>Vote WA <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/as-the-august-primary-looms-washingtons-new-voter-system-struggles-to-stay-online/">had some issues</a> in testing during the run-up to the August primary elections, but officials during that election <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washingtons-primary-election-tests-new-voter-system-but-everything-went-according-to-plan/">said it performed fine</a>.</p>
