Hamilton: Mercedes car ""had the capability but I couldn't put the lap together""
03 Nov 2019, 13:22 by Matt Gretton

Lewis Hamilton deems his qualifying performance in the United States as one of the worst for a long time. His teammate clinched pole position while the British F1 driver slumped to P5. The Mercedes car was able to get on the front row, but Hamilton says he ""couldn't pull the lap together"". 

Hamilton, who can win his sixth Formula 1 world championship on Sunday afternoon, believes it'll be a tough challenge to get past both Ferrari cars but he'll try his hardest to fight back. 



""This must be one of the worst qualifying sessions I’ve had in a long time. Clearly, the car had the capability to be on the front row, I just couldn’t put the lap together. Valtteri did a great job, so congratulations to him,"" Hamilton said. 

""Now I’ll have to try and figure out what went wrong today and how I can get myself to the front. It’s going to be a tough challenge trying to get past two Ferraris, a Red Bull and Valtteri, but I’ll continue to work at it and hope that I can do a better job tomorrow.""

Hamilton needs to score just four points to win the championship. If Bottas fails to win the race, the title will be Hamilton's.
