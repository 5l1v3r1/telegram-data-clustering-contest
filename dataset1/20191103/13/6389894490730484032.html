      </p>
      <p>The agency announced it had added a one-off charge of £6.4m to its accounts in August to correct a “misapplication of accounting policies”.</p>
      <p>M&amp;C Saatchi is now informally speaking to M+A advisers Clarity in an attempt to overhaul the company, according to The Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>The talks have caused speculation that the company may be forced to look for a buyer.</p>
      <p>August’s accounting admission caused stocks in M&amp;C Saatchi to fall from a peak of 339p in August to its current 169p level.</p>
      <p>The company also reported in August that it owes £22m over the next year, which equates to £14m of the company’s value.</p>
      <p>Directors tried to purchase shares in the company to instil confidence, however this was to no avail.</p>
      <p>The stock slump is exacerbated by the fact that the firm is made up of a number of smaller agencies, which are paid for with its own shares.</p>
