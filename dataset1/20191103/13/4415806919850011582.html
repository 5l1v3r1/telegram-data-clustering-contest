      <p>It was not immediately known if the migrants would stay in Italy or be distributed among other European Union countries.</p>

      <p>Under an EU-brokered deal, 67 of them will go to four other countries, while the others will stay in Italy.</p>
      <p>A Taranto official, Gabriella Ficocelli, told Italian news agency ANSA that the migrants included five unaccompanied minors who were “tired and tried by the voyage”.</p>
      <p>They disembarked eight days after being rescued from Libyan-based traffickers’ unseaworthy vessels in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
