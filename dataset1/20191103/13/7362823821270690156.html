      <p>Someone inside the house found the girl, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">who investigators said</a> was scared, and supervised her for an hour while others tried searching for her guardian, <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/man-accused-of-leaving-child-alone-in-haunted-house">WOFL reported</a>.
