      <p>Fans have known for a while that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/affair-renewed-fifth-final-season-showtime-1129988?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral"><i>The Affair </i>won't return</a> after the Season 5 finale, but no one could predict how the story would eventually play out. In July 2018, before Season 4 ended, Showtime announced that the fifth would be its last, per <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, and that co-creator and show runner Sarah Treem had "always envisioned" only five seasons. Weeks later, the death of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/is-ruth-wilson-in-the-affair-season-5-alisons-death-is-still-a-mystery-18692747">Ruth Wilson's character Alison Bailey</a> took everyone by surprise and an entire season still lingered ahead.</p>
      <p>After Alison's death aired, Treem told <i>THR </i>that she always saw it as a possibility, but it was made official when Wilson wanted to leave. "That was a request, so that was decided basically before we started writing," Treem said. "It wasn't a discovery of any kind. That was very deliberate."</p>
      <p>Season 5 explored the aftermath of Alison's death and introduced a new character and timeline — <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/803390/the-affair-season-5-anna-paquin-joanie/">Alison's grown daughter Joanie (Anna Paquin)</a>, who's determined to get to the bottom of the circumstances around her mother's death. She told TV Insider before the Season 5 premiere, "Everything the audience knows about her life is not necessarily the version of events as she understands it. Obviously, she's grown up without a mother, which has had a profound effect. She and everyone else is very confused about how her mother died. The audience knows more sometimes than the character does."</p>

      <p>Still, the departure of Wilson did leave some fans wondering what had happened. And in this case, the audience likely knows a lot <i>less</i> than the talent. For example, in an interview with <i>CBS This Morning</i>, Wilson revealed that she's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLZQfnFyelTBOQ15kmHSgEbdjzLMWzZpL7&amp;time_continue=3&amp;v=RkvykjZX7KU">"not allowed to talk about why" she left</a> <i>The Affair</i>, although there are speculations based on an earlier interview she did with the <i>Radio Times. </i>In that interview, Wilson spoke about<i> </i><a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-02-19/golden-globe-winner-ruth-wilson-im-sure-co-star-dominic-west-gets-paid-more-for-the-affair/">pay parity and her co-star Dominic West</a>. "He definitely gets more than me," she said in the interview. "I mean, I don’t know what the figure is, but I’m sure he does.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with Vulture, Wilson stressed that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/ruth-wilson-addresses-alisons-death-on-the-affair.html">she had no creative input</a> on Alison's ending, and later that month, she told the <i>New York Times </i>that her departure was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/style/ruth-wilson-the-affair-little-stranger.html">“a much bigger story"</a> than what people suspected. In September 2018, Joshua Jackson, who played Alison's first husband on the show, announced that <a href="https://tvline.com/2018/09/25/joshua-jackson-leaving-the-affair-season-5-cole/">he would not return</a> as a regular for Season 5, per TVLine.</p>

      <p>A year after Alison's death aired, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/maura-tierney-the-affair-final-season-interview">cast member Maura Tierney weighed in</a>. "The work was certainly very demanding for [Wilson.] Like, that character was just suffering all the time. I mean, I can’t speculate as to what happened," she told <i>Vanity Fair</i>. “You know, this show is very specific. And it’s very demanding. And sometimes people have a shelf life for it. I think that’s what I would say.”</p>
      <p>Whatever the impetus behind Wilson's departure, the final season of <i>The Affair</i> wrapped up a ton of storylines and left viewers with most of the answers they were looking for.</p>
