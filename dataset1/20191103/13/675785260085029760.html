      <h1>Chris Kamara claims VAR official "decided they didn't want Liverpool to score"</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool were denied an equalising goal at Aston Villa on Saturday, but went on to win the match 2-1</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T13:50:59+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit Chris Kamara has hit out at the VAR decision that denied <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> a goal at Aston Villa on Saturday, claiming that the call was deliberately made.</p>
      <p>With the Reds trailing 1-0 at Villa Park, Roberto Firmino turned home a Sadio Mane cross to equalise in the first half.</p>
      <p>The goal was disallowed on the pitch at the time, but a VAR review showed Firmino to be as good as level with Villa defender Tyrone Mings from Mane's cross.</p>
      <p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/new-footage-proves-roberto-firmino-20801307">as highlighted by Andy Gray on beIN Sports</a> , Firmino was first shown to be onside before the VAR lines were redrawn and he was marginally off.</p>

      <p>The decision ultimately didn't matter too much for Liverpool after they came back to win 2-1 thanks to late goals from Andy Robertson and Mane, but Kamara slammed the VAR officials responsible, with the game being overseen by Martin Atkinson.</p>
      <p>“I’m not happy with it, I’ll be 100 per cent honest with you," he said on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“In my opinion this is made up, this has been made up by somebody at Stockley Park who’s decided they don’t want this to be a goal, and that is my opinion, and that is my honest opinion.</p>

      <p>“From the naked eye you don’t need that calibration of dots or whatever to tell you, look at Tyrone Mings’ knee, Firmino is onside, right.</p>
      <p>“So you look at the yellow line and there’s a black line there as well. So they’ve done that there - that tells you that he was onside.</p>
      <p>“So they change it round now to make it that Firmino is the black line and Tyrone Mings is the yellow line, as you can see now.”</p>

      <p>Kamara even held up a piece of paper to the screen to prove that the VAR lines drawn weren't straight.</p>
      <p>“But the line that comes up towards Firmino isn’t straight - that’s not a straight line, that’s an angled line," he continued.</p>
      <p>“I put a piece of paper to it this morning haven’t I and I showed you - that is not a straight line.</p>
      <p>“Get your rulers out, get your spirit level out. That red line is not a straight line.</p>

      <p>“Now, somebody has decided to do that and I think they should be outed because that is not offside for me.</p>
      <p>“That’s why it’s not a straight line, look at that paper, look how angled it is, that’s not a straight line.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool's late win keeps them six points clear at the top of the Premier League table ahead of a meeting with second-place <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> next Sunday.</p>
