The Portuguese star already has five Ballon d'Or accolades to his name, which he collected during his time with Manchester United and Real Madrid.
Ronaldo is yet to claim one since joining Juventus after Luka Modric was crowned as the 2018 winner, although he has been named on the 30-man shortlist for 2019.
""There's a mafia. That's the right word to describe it. Yes, there is a football mafia. If you look at everything that has happened, you'll realise that it's because of this mafia,"" Dolores Averio said, as per AS.
When asked if Ronaldo would win his sixth Ballon d'Or this year, she added,""I don't know if he'll win it, but I'm confident. I think if you look at everything he did last season, he deserves it.""
