Starship is threatening strong legal action after nude photos of Monsta X Shownu get leaked online.On November 3, an individual on Twitter posted three photos online and claimed that they were of Monsta X’s Shownu. In the photos, a man can be seen sleeping on a bed in his underwear, and one of the photos is more explicit than the others as he appears to be fully unclothed. The photos in question seem to have been taken in secret while the man was asleep, and they began spreading quickly on social media and online communities.Starship alleged the photos were ""fabricated"" and released an official statement on the afternoon of the 3rd stating, ""We will report to the police those who spread the illegally taken photos for violating the law of Sexual Violence Crimes and will strongly respond with legal action by seeking civil damages against the crime of circulating obscene materials under the Information and Communication Network Act.""




1. [+1,681, -403] Yea he's done..he had such an innocent image too...a lot of people are talking about it.
2. [+1,458, -235] Now that it's happened to a man they're going to tighten the law on molka ㅋㅋ
3. [+1,051, -205] Just wait, now that it happened to a guy they'll come out with the ""Shownu Law"" even though this has happened to many women for billions of years...just look at the ranking search terms right now..
4. [+1,070, -567] There's a bunch of secondary perpetrators too...take them with you.
5. [+1,016, -416] Do you think it makes sense that they're manipulated if they were taken while asleep?
6. [+938, -401] Clarify the issue first...don't use the excuse that they're fabricated and blame the perpetrator.
7. [+667, -242] He's not even married yet. This is troubling..
8. [+528, -116] Please respond without mercy~
9. [+516, -159] How can he go to his parents home now?
10. [+473, -125] These comments are so fake. It's wrong to spread photos of a celebrity's personal life and laugh about it on a group chat. Starship needs to work hard this time and respond without mercy.
