Circuit of the Americas listens to criticism: Track to be resurfaced in the winter
03 Nov 2019, 13:35 by Matt Gretton

Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Kevin Magnussen are just a few of the Formula 1 drivers complaining about the bumpy nature of COTA this weekend. On route to the first corner, it's possible to see the cars bouncing around in the braking zone. The track will be resurfaced in the winter to avoid a repeat of this in the 2020 F1 season. 

During the winter, they'll close the circuit to get started on the work. On Friday, they frantically tried to fix the problem and smooth the tarmac, but this proved impossible.



In December and January, the track will be resurfaced. According to Bobby Epstein, boss of the circuit, not all of the track will be completed with new tarmac but a considerable amount will be. 



Prior to the MotoGP race held earlier this year, part of the circuit has already been tackled, which should have been sufficient to also drive the GP of America without problems in F1 cars. Something that Epstein acknowledges is underestimated.
