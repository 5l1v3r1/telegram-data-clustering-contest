      <h1>Iran's Khamenei: U.S. Trapped and Outflanked Since 1979 Revolution</h1>
      <h2>Iran’s supreme leader says his country has outmaneuvered the United States in the four decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, pushing it back into a geopolitical corner from which it has never recovered.</h2>

      <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Iran has “trapped the other party in the corner of the ring in many cases” although he provided no evidence to back his claim.</p>
      <p>His claim does however continue a elaborate them in Iranian politics that the U.S. is a beaten party and the Islamic republic stands alone astride Middle East politics.</p>
      <p>He says U.S. aggression toward Iran has only grown “wilder and more flagrant” over the years.</p>
      <p>Khamenei’s official website published his remarks to thousands of students Sunday, a day before the 40th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover in Tehran.</p>
      <p>Tensions have been high between Washington and Tehran after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s flawed 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has sought to roll back Iran’s influence across the region by imposing sanctions and providing military and other aid to its adversaries.</p>
      <p>For its part, as recently as June this year Iran was warning the U.S. it had to be prepared to be crushed across the Middle East.</p>
      <p>“Zionists” were also warned they face the same fate in the announcement.</p>
      <p>General Rahim Safavi <a href="https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980318000312">told</a> the local Fars newsagency Iran has the ability to hit far beyond its borders and its enemies should take note.</p>
      <p>As Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/05/26/weakest-in-history-iran-taunts-u-s-military-gathering-in-middle-east/">reported</a>, just weeks before that threat the U.S. military presence in the Middle East was dismissed as its “weakest in history” by a deputy commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.</p>
      <p>Admiral Ali Fadavi, a deputy Guards commander, made the accusation but failed to add any evidence to back his claim.</p>
      <p>“The Americans have been present in the region since 1833 and they are now at their weakest in history in West Asia,” Fadavi is alleged to have said.</p>
      <p>Tehran has previously described U.S. military moves as “psychological warfare” and a “political game”designed to hurt the innocent Iran people.</p>
