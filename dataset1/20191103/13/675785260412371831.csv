Eddie, from London, was visiting family nearby when he saw the aftermath.
The 22-year-old said: ""I came to visit my family, I was in last night and I heard a bang. I thought it was a lorry that might have dropped over.

""At first there was two other girls that live down the road and they were helping, trying to get the passenger out of the car.
""There was one woman in the passenger seat they got her out of the car and sat her down on the pavement by the shop and they got her a glass of water - she was in a panic.""
He added: ""There was a resident saying her room was shaking.
""There were about 60/70 people last night. All crowding.

""I didn’t want to look to be honest, it was horrible.
“You could see inside the car inside the pub.”
Aruben Shan, 41, who works in the convenience store next door, arrived at 7am to see the road blocked.
""I didn’t know then what had happened,"" he said.
""I asked the police to open the shop and they said no. I was shocked.

""I got in after 9. I do not know who is injured or who is dead. It is heartbreaking.""
Ed Hamilton, 19, has also described hearing a ""big bang"" as he was about to go to sleep.
""It is obviously an awful horrible incident,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Essex Police confirmed a 40-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
