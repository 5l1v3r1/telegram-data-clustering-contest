      <p>Imelda Staunton and Ellie Goulding are among the stars who appear in a video for Extinction Rebellion devised by Richard Curtis.</p>
      <p>The short film outlines the demands of the group and asks governments where is their plan to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>It also features Jaime Winstone, Daisy Lowe and Stephen Frears, as well as children from as young as eight as they demand a plan to address the crisis.</p>
      <p>The concept for the film was developed by Love Actually director Curtis, and was shot and produced by Rankin – an agency headed up by the British photographer of the same name.</p>
      <p>Winstone said: “This film must reach governments and ring the alarm bell to act now on the climate crisis we are all living in. We must all ask of them #WhereIsYourPlan.”</p>
