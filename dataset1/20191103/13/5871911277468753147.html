      <h1>Your Morning Dump... Where it's taking the Celtics 24 minutes to find their rhythm</h1>

      <blockquote>The Celtics have averaged just 47 points per first half this season in an NBA where scoring is soaring. The Celtics are also last in first-half field goal percentage (36.1) and 3-point percentage (24.4)…<br/>The problem is three of the Celtics’ primary scorers — Walker, Gordon Hayward, and Tatum – are combining for 30.7 percent shooting in the first half. Meanwhile, Walker and Jaylen Brown are shooting 25 percent from the 3-point line in the first half. <br/>…<br/>Boston is No. 1 in the NBA in second-half points with 62.8. They are 10th in field-goal percentage and second in 3-point percentage (35.6). And they are a respectable 11th in free throw attempts (14.4) because of Walker, who is fifth in the NBA in attempts…<br/>What is stunning is the trio of Walker, Hayward, and Tatum are shooting a combined 57.6 percent from the 3-point line in the second half. Walker is averaging 17 points after halftime because he is getting to the free-throw line nearly five times.</blockquote>

      <p>Gary Washburn offers some interesting insight into the Celtics 1st and 2nd half production.</p>
      <p>It’s not uncommon for a team to start slowly, but what stands out to me is the Celtics’ stars are underperforming (and subsequently thriving) in unison.</p>
      <p>Might this be proof that the guys are still learning to play effectively together? Maybe pressing early in games, or thinking too much about getting teammates involved?</p>
      <p>I’m pulling ideas out of my a$$. But I’m willing to bet this sharp contrast by half eventually fades.</p>
      <h3>On Page 2, Carsen Edwards takes drastic action to end his shooting slump.</h3>

      <p>After shooting a blistering 51% in the preseason, Edwards is just 5-22 (22%, 15% 3 FG) in the regular season.</p>
      <p>I don’t know for certain if the shooting woes contributed to the buzz cut, but I support anything that gets this kid on track.</p>
      <p>I stand by my preseason prediction that he’ll be a difference-maker off Boston’s bench.</p>
      <h3>And finally, another update from Brooklyn.</h3>

      <p>‘Irresponsible to overreact’ is Stage 1 of denying Kyrie is a problem. I know it very, very well.</p>
