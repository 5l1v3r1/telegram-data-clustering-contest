      <p>Saudi Aramco finally announced it would begin its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) this morning after nearly four years of uncertainty and delays.</p>
      <p>The world’s most valuable company will list on Saudi Arabia’s domestic Tadawul exchange in December, with an international float planned afterwards.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sources told Reuters that the initial plan is to sell one to two per cent of the company, which has been valued at $1.5 trillion by independent investors. </p>
      <p>Such a valuation would make Saudi Aramco at least 50 per cent more valuable than Apple and Microsoft, each of which have a market capitalisation of $1 trillion.</p>
      <p>Despite being below Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s personal preference for a valuation of $2 trillion, a two percent sale at $1.5 trillion would raise up to $40bn for the kingdom, making it the largest IPO of all time.</p>
      <p>The oil giant’s chief executive said that the prospectus for the IPO would be issued on 9 November, with both the institutional and retail investor roadshow to take two weeks.</p>
      <p>This is far quicker than the four to six weeks the process would normally take on the Saudi bourse.</p>
      <p>Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told the press conference that the valuation for the company should be determined after the roadshow.</p>
      <p>The company also announced that Saudi nationals subscribing to the listing would be eligible for bonus shares.</p>
      <p>A statement from the company also said that it posted a net income of $68bn during the nine-month period ending on 30 September, with revenues amounting to $244bn.</p>
      <p>More than two dozen banks are handling the IPO, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p>Analysts welcomed the move, which had been expected. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at markets.com, said: “It’s time to bite the bullet.”</p>
      <p>“The world is awash with crude, and it will be very hard to get prices any higher with demand forecasts for 2020 as low as they are.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Some, however, were concerned over the valuation. Michael Hewson, head markets analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p>
      <p>“A $2trn valuation seems a bit rich at a time when oil as a fuel is in decline, and renewables becomes more mainstream.”</p>
      <p>The sale is an essential element of bin Salman’s Vision 2030, as it will be a main source of funding for his plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels in the next decade.</p>
