      <h2>The Government has published a list of unclaimed estates north of the border, with hundreds of thousands of pounds in assets up for grabs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T11:06:14+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Hilary Mitchell, Ben Weich</a></address>
      <p>If you happen to have the right surname, you could be in line to claim any one of the 435 empty Scottish estates worth up to £370,000.</p>
      <p>The Government has just published a list of estates across Scotland which have been left unclaimed after their owners died either without making a will or without identifying a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inheritance-tax">next of kin</a> .</p>
      <p>When a person dies in Scotland without leaving a will detailing their desired benefactors, any unclaimed assets automatically fall under the care of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crown-estate">the Crown</a> , and are then placed in the care of The Office of Queen’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer.</p>
      <p>In March 2016, the Succession Act passed by the Scottish Parliament made the process of claiming unwanted estates easier, removing the requirement to obtain a 'bond of caution' - a type of insurance provided only by a small number of firms in the UK.</p>

      <p>Cash, land, assets and homes - some as large as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rags-to-riches">mansions and castles</a> - could be up for grabs, providing claimants are able to successfully prove they are entitled to them.</p>
      <p>When a person dies with no will, everything they owned can theoretically be claimed.</p>
      <p>And it could start by simply noticing you have the same surname as the previous owner of an estate.</p>
      <p>Some of the more unusual surnames on the list include Carlin, Hunniball, Malone-Philban and Raube.</p>

      <p>The estates will eventually revert to the Crown if no next of kin are identified.</p>
      <p>If you think you are entitled to claim an estate, applications can be submitted <a href="https://www.unclaimedestates.com/blog/1077/unclaimed-inheritance-in-scotland">here</a> .</p>
      <p>You can download the list for the rest of Scotland <a href="https://www.qltr.gov.uk/content/estates-which-administration-has-been-completed-and-which-remain-available-claim">here</a> .</p>
      <p>There are thought to currently be more than 8,000 unclaimed estates in England and Wales.</p>
      <p>This summer, London pensioner Margaret Abbotts inherited more than £300,000 from a half sister she never knew she had, after she was contacted by a law firm specialising in forensic genealogy.</p>
      <p>Advice on unclaimed estates in England and Wales is available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-a-claim-to-a-deceased-persons-estate">here</a> .</p>
