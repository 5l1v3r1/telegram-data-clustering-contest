      <p>Some high school students in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana">Louisiana</a> were apparently able to get out of school because of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health">medical clinic employee</a> who allegedly wrote them phony doctor's notes — <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">for $20 each</a>.</p>
      <p>Belina Fondren, 52, is accused of selling fake medical excuses to two students at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school">Evans High School</a>, officials said. She allegedly sold the doctor's notes to two different students on 14 occasions.</p>

      <p>Investigators said a physician received a call from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/teachers">Vernon Parish School Board</a> about the apparent absence notes. The physician told authorities he didn't treat the students, and he didn't authorize their medical excuse notes.</p>
