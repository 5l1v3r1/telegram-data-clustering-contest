      <p>Israel has launched a series of raids targeting various locations in the Gaza Strip. The attacks came in response to a rocket barrage fired earlier from the Strip into Israeli towns and settlements.<br/><br/>The Palestinian Ministry of Health said Ahmed al-Shehri, 27, was killed during pre-dawn attacks on areas west of Khan Younis on Saturday.<br/><br/>Two other Palestinians sustained moderate or serious shrapnel wounds from one of the strikes, according to the ministry.<br/><br/>The rockets and raids were launched one day after new clashes erupted as part of the “March of Return” demonstrations near the Strip's border with Israel.<br/><br/>They resulted in wounding more than 90 Palestinians on Friday, including 50 with bullets, according to the Hamas-led Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip.<br/><br/>“Israeli warplanes attacked a wide array of targets, including a military compound belonging to the naval forces of Hamas group, a military compound belonging to the organization’s air defense system, a missile simulator, training facilities, an arms manufacturing site, and a military compound used as a weapons storehouse,” the army said in a statement.<br/><br/>Ten rockets were fired into Israel in two separate barrages on Friday night, the army noted, adding that one projectile slammed into a house in the town of Sderot, while the Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted eight other rockets.<br/><br/>This was the second night in a row that rockets were fired from the Strip into Israeli territory, following a six-week truce.<br/><br/>The videos released by the army showed the moment of bombing sites in the Strip in open lands.<br/><br/>The Israeli army held Hamas accountable for the rocket fire from Gaza, while Hamas responded that the Israeli bombardment was a serious escalation against innocent civilians and would retaliate against the occupation.<br/><br/>Israel routinely holds Gaza’s Hamas rulers responsible for any violence emanating from the Strip.</p>
