03 Nov 2019, 11:44 by TIMESOFINDIA.COM
Salman Khan made a grand announcement on Friday as he revealed the cast of ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’, posting a glimpse from the film’s muhurat. Disha Patani, who had romanced Salman in ‘Bharat’, returns to playing his leading lady in this cop drama. Prabhdeva will be calling the shots for this action flick which will feature Randeep Hooda as the villain.



And while it has been spelled clearly that Salman will play a cop in this out-and-out action flick, here are some deets on Disha’s character. A source informed an online portal that Disha will only have a brief role in ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’, which will mainly focus on Salman’s action avatar as a cop. The film will reportedly be in the ‘Wanted’ zone and Disha was aware of her role before she signed up to play the lead.
‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ shoot will go on for a month at Mumbai’s Mehboob Studios. Salman Khan is planning to wrap one schedule of ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ before he begins with the promotions of ‘Dabangg 3’, which is set to hit the screens in December. The actor is also planning to shoot a song at an international location. The film is produced by Sohail Khan and Atul Agnihotri. At the box office, ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ will clash with Akshay Kumar’s horror drama ‘Laxmmi Bomb’. Both the film are eyeing Eid 2020.
