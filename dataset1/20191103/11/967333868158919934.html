      <p>A teenage boy has been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911011077199158-four-people-reportedly-killed-10-wounded-at-halloween-party-shooting-in-california---video/">charged with attempted murder</a> after shooting a seven-year-old girl who was trick-or-treating in the Little Village neighbourhood of Western Chicago. Once a thriving Eastern European neighbourhood, Little Village, also called South Lawndale, is known as the "Mexico of the Midwest" and is home to a sizeable Hispanic community.</p>
      <p>The bullet hit the girl at the base of her neck; she was sent to hospital and is now in critical but stable condition, according to police spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi.</p>
      <p>According to the official, the girl was struck by a stray bullet during a gang shooting; the intended victim, a 30-year-old man, was injured in the hand.</p>
      <p>Mr Guglielmi noted that at the time of the incident, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911011077194440-7-year-old-man-wounded-in-chicago-shooting/">the suspected shooter</a> was wearing a mask resembling the one worn by Jason from the Friday the 13th movies.</p>
      <p>It's the latest incident in a string of shootings in Chicago involving innocent bystanders.</p>
      <p>The shooting comes days after<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201810091068728828-trump-chicago-kanye-west/"> US President Donald Trump visited Chicago</a> for the first time in his tenure, dubbing the city a "haven for criminals" and "embarrassing to us as a nation". The visit of the US president was boycotted by the mayor and police superintendent.</p>
