      <p>Sarah Jessica-Parker appears to have confirmed that the original cast of 1993 cult comedy <i>Hocus Pocus</i> – Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and herself – have all agreed to star in the proposed sequel.</p>
      <p>The former <i>Sex and the City</i> star posted a picture of the trio from the original film on Instagram on Friday (November 1). One fan asked the actor in the comments: ‘any chance of a sequel?!’</p>

      <p>Jessica-Parker replied: ‘we have all said yes. Now we wait. X’</p>
      <p>The news will come as a relief to fans of the original story, as there was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/hocus-pocus-2-sequel-remake-update-without-original-cast-2145803">previously some doubt as to whether Midler, Jessica-Parker and Najimy would appear in the new <i>Hocus Pocus</i> film</a> – prompting a slew of unimpressed reactions on social media.</p>

      <p>Based on a story by Mick Garris and David Kirschner, the original film followed a comedic trio of witches who are inadvertently resurrected by a boy struggling to fit in at his new hometown of Salem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/bette-midler-and-kathy-najimy-dish-on-upcoming-hocus-pocus-sequel-and-if-theyd-be-involved">Speaking to <i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a>, Bette Midler joked about waiting to be asked to reprise the role, expected to appear on streaming service Disney+. “I hope they get to me before I’m a corpse,” she quipped.</p>
      <p>“We wanna fly again. I hope Disney+ is a big success and I hope we get to do it, because she is one of my favourite characters… I can’t wait to read the script. We’re gonna see what happens,” Midler said in the interview.</p>
      <p>Najimy, who played Mary Sanderson in the original <i>Hocus Pocus</i>, said she hoped to at least do a cameo in the new project. “Here’s the honest answer: Sarah and Bette and I all have a million projects and things that we’re into, so I don’t know if they’re gonna offer us [roles]. I don’t know if the worlds are going to collide so that we could all three do it at the same time.</p>
      <p>“But I’m happy that it’s happening, because the fans are really rabid and they really want it. If we’re not all available to star in it, I think it would be so great to do a cameo. I think that’d be really fun,” the actor added.</p>
