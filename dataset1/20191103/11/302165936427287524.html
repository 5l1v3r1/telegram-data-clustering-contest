      <p>BAABDA (Lebanon), Nov 3 — Thousands of backers of Lebanon’s embattled president rallied today in a show of support, after more than two weeks of massive nationwide anti-graft protests that brought down the government.</p>
      <p>They paid tribute to President Michel Aoun outside the capital, ahead of another demonstration planned in Beirut to demand a complete overhaul of a political system deemed inefficient and corrupt.</p>
      <p>In the town of Baabda, supporters of the retired general turned head of state filled up a two-kilometre-long road leading to the presidential palace, an AFP correspondent said.</p>
      <p>Fans of the president waved large Lebanese flags and orange-coloured banners of the political party he founded, the Free Patriotic Movement, he said.</p>
      <p>“We are here, General. We won’t abandon you as long as we live,” one poster read, responding to a cross-sectarian movement calling for an end to his term.</p>
      <p>Some Aoun supporters wore orange T-shirts while others held up portraits of the 84-year-old president.</p>
      <p>“General Aoun is a reformist and sincere man — not corrupt nor a thief,” said one supporter who gave her name as Diana.</p>
      <p>“There has been corruption in the state for 30 years. The president isn’t responsible. He’s trying to fight against graft,” she said.</p>
      <p>In Baabda, Aoun supporters said they backed the general demands of protesters nationwide, but insisted the president was the only man able to bring about reforms.</p>
      <p>“There were slogans against the president. That’s not fair,” said Hanna Nader, an unemployed man in his forties.</p>
      <p>More than 25 per cent of the Lebanese live in poverty, the World Bank says.</p>
      <p>Economic growth in Lebanon has stalled in recent years in the wake of repeated political crises, compounded by an eight-year civil war in neighbouring Syria.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his cabinet would step down.</p>
      <p>But it is still unclear what a new government will look like and if it will include independent technocrats as demanded by demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Thousands of anti-government protesters flocked together in the northern city of Tripoli yesterday night, many from other parts of the country. — AFP</p>
