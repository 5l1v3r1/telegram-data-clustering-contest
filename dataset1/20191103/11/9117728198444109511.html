        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> has said that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> needs to accept the fact the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> are in front of them now. McLaren holds 38 point advantage going into the final three races and it's highly unlikely that Renault will be able to overtake the fourth-placed teams in the final races.</b>

      <p>The McLaren duo qualified in P7 and P8 for the United States Grand Prix whilst Ricciardo and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> reached ninth and 11th respectively.</p>
      <p>“<i>Obviously they’ve been a target for us this year but now that we’re at the end of the year, pretty much, I think we have to accept that they’ve been better than us this year and more times than not now they’re going to be faster than us</i>,” Ricciardo told RaceFans.net.</p>
      <p>“<i>It’s just how it is</i>. “<i>To be disappointed they’re in front now doesn’t really make sense any more because I think that we have to accept that at the moment they are in front. So being behind them, I think was the best I could do</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>I’m obviously not saying we’re going to give up for the next few races. But looking ahead to next year, hopefully, we can bring them back towards us</i>."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> are just nine points adrift of Renault in sixth, which makes for an interesting finish to the season.</p>
