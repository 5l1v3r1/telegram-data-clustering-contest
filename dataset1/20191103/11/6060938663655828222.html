      <p>And while it has been spelled clearly that Salman will play a cop in this out-and-out action flick, here are some deets on Disha’s character. A source informed an online portal that Disha will only have a brief role in ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’, which will mainly focus on Salman’s action avatar as a cop. The film will reportedly be in the ‘Wanted’ zone and Disha was aware of her role before she signed up to play the lead.</p>
      <p>‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ shoot will go on for a month at Mumbai’s Mehboob Studios. Salman Khan is planning to wrap one schedule of ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ before he begins with the promotions of ‘Dabangg 3’, which is set to hit the screens in December. The actor is also planning to shoot a song at an international location. The film is produced by Sohail Khan and Atul Agnihotri. At the box office, ‘Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai’ will clash with Akshay Kumar’s horror drama ‘Laxmmi Bomb’. Both the film are eyeing Eid 2020.</p>
