      <p>(Reuters) - Nelly Korda won the Taiwan Swinging Skirts LPGA in a three-way playoff on Sunday, giving her caddie Jason McDede bragging rights over his fiancée Caroline Masson.</p>
      <p>In a rare co-incidence, Korda beat Masson in the playoff.</p>
      <p>McDede and Masson are due to be married next year, and Sunday was the first time they had gone head-to-head vying for an LPGA title.</p>
      <p>McDede came out on top when his boss Korda birdied the first extra hole at Miramar Golf Club in New Taipei City.</p>
      <p>German Masson described the experience as “a little funny” but was magnanimous in defeat.</p>
      <p>“I’m quite happy to see them win,” she said of the Korda-McDede professional partnership.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of the two of them, the way they work together, and hopefully I get another chance to beat them down the stretch the next few years.”</p>
      <p>In successfully defending her title, American Korda earned her third LPGA victory.</p>
      <p>She, Masson and Australian Minjee Lee finished the regulation 72 holes at 18-under-par 270.</p>
