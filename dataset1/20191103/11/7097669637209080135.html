      <h1>Sri Lanka election head withdraws TV censorship after criticism</h1>

      <p>Sri Lanka's election commission chief on Sunday backed down from plans to censor a state-owned TV station following criticism that his actions were supporting the main opposition candidate at this month's presidential polls.</p>
      <p>In a surprise move, commission chairman Mahinda Deshapriya had banned any political programing on the Independent Television Network (ITN) after accusing the channel of harming the campaign of frontrunner Gotabhaya Rajapakse.</p>
      <p>"After considering many representations by several parties that my order was discriminatory, I revoke the (censorship) order issued on ITN," Deshapriya said in a letter to the broadcaster, seen by AFP.</p>
      <p>The censorship order, which had been due to come into effect midnight Sunday, came after ITN aired a programme alleging loyalists to the previous regime thwarted a corruption probe into strongman ex-president Mahinda Rajapakse's family.</p>
      <p>Independent poll-monitoring group the People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said privately-owned TV stations were worse than ITN in violating campaign laws and in supporting one candidate over others.</p>
      <p>"We have always maintained that it is discriminatory to target only state-run media because the bigger offenders are the private channels," PAFFREL chief Rohana Hettiarachchi told AFP.</p>
      <p>He said his organisation was instead calling for the strict implementation of campaign rules on all media outlets.</p>
      <p>"They are all using frequencies which belong to all people of this country," he said.</p>
      <p>"Therefore all have a responsibility to provide balanced coverage without breaking campaign laws."</p>
      <p>The censorship ordered by Deshapriya on ITN applied to live coverage of any event. It was the first time a Sri Lankan election chief has ordered censorship of a TV station.</p>
      <p>Official sources said the unprecedented media ban also caused friction within the three-member Election Commission, with at least one commissioner openly challenging Deshapriya and accusing him of acting arbitrarily.</p>
      <p>"The restriction on ITN was Stalinist," commission member Ratnajeevan Hoole told AFP.</p>
      <p>"The correct thing would have been to impose heavy fines for violations... whether by private or state media."</p>
      <p>The commission last week said it received many complaints about other channels campaigning for Rajapakse without declaring their bias, but could not take action as they were all private networks.</p>
      <p>Gotabhaya Rajapakse was defence secretary for a decade until his president brother Mahinda was voted out in 2015.</p>
      <p>The opposition candidate is the current favourite, even though his bid is widely seen as a front to get Mahinda -- barred from contesting the election because of a two-term limit -- back into power.</p>
      <p>Mahinda's rule was marked by the end of a bloody civil war against ethnic Tamil rebels, and an international outcry over alleged human rights violations by Sri Lankan troops.</p>
      <p>The election has attracted a record 35 candidates, with nearly 16 million people eligible to vote.</p>
      <p>Last week, the commission said it was working with Facebook to take down posts that defamed election candidates.</p>
