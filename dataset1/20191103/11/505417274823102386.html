      <h1>Canelo Crowned Four-Weight World Champion After Flattening Kovalev</h1>

        <b>Canelo Álvarez cemented his spot at the top of the world’s best pound-for-pound pugilists by flattening Sergey Kovalev to claim the WBO light heavyweight title in Las Vegas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Mexican stepped up two whole weight classes to face heavy hitter Kovalev. The fight may have lacked the action that fans desired from two of the game’s greats with the crowd at the MGM Grand booing on occasion.</p>
      <p>However, the stoppage proved to be worth the entrance fee alone as Canelo dropped his opponent with a powerful left-right combination late in the eleventh round.</p>

      <p>The win sees <a href="https://twitter.com/Canelo">Canelo</a> crowned a world champion in a fourth different weight class. Where he goes next from here though is difficult to say. The Mexican fighter turned down a trilogy fight with Gennadiy Golovkin in favour of facing the Russian fighter as part of the $365m deal he signed with streaming service DAZN.</p>
      <p>While Canelo may have further cemented his legacy as one of the greatest boxers of all time, all anyone seems to be discussing this morning is that both fighters were made to wait 90 minutes before entering the ring so that fans could watch the <a href="https://punditarena.com/mma/oisinmcqueirns2758/jorge-masvidal-defeats-nate-diaz-via-doctor-stoppage-wins-bmf-title/">UFC 244 main-event between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz at Madison Square Garden.</a></p>

      <p>Both Canelo and Kovalev were pictured sleeping in their locker rooms in full fight attire while they should have been taking to the ring to face off with one another. The delay was, reportedly, enforced by DAZN who wished to wait until the UFC’s New York show had wrapped before letting the two men square off.</p>
