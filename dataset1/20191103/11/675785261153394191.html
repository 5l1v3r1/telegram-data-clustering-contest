      <p>Gaffney, from Maywood, allegedly told police that he and Francis had taken prescription medication and were having sex when she lost consciousness, a law enforcement source said.</p>
      <p>It is alleged she had bruises on her neck.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether Francis and Gaffney knew each other previously or if they had just met at the party.</p>
