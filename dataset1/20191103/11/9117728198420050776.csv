Aston Martin Red Bull Racing team advisor Helmut Marko has said that he has got no plans to retire just yet. The 76-year-old still flies all around the world with the team and he has no intention of this stopping anytime soon.

""As long as I can perform this work mentally, I can continue to do so,"" Marko told Motorsport-total. com.



 “I don't understand why some people are so upset that they have to fly a lot. The majority of people crave such adventures and I fly with a certain degree of comfort.""
