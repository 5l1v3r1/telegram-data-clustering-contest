      <h1>Christmas favourite with a twist - are you ready for pigs in blankets ice cream?</h1>
      <h2>Gelato maker Fabio Vincenti has joined the ranks of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal with this eccentric savoury ice cream, inventing a desert tasting of sausage and bacon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T11:06:43+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Havis, Ben Weich</a></address>
      <p>Are you already feeling festive? You can now get pigs in blankets ice cream - made with real meat and served in a Yorkshire pudding.</p>
      <p>Fabio’s Gelato in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which counts Premier League ace Jack Wilshere among its regulars, created the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ice-cream">bizarre concoction</a> ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>It features sausage, bacon, vanilla ice cream and maple syrup, served in a Yorkshire pud.</p>
      <p>Owner Fabio Vincenti, who started the business with his wife Hannah, said: “Having had bacon on pancakes and chips dunked in milkshake, we were hoping for that spectrum of flavours.</p>
      <p>“It's cold, sweet and creamy with a sweet and salty maple-smoked flavour, and an aftertaste of sausage pigs in blankets.</p>

      <p>“It really works – think bacon maple pancakes. Bacon makes anything taste nice, even Brussels sprouts!”</p>
      <p>If you’re sceptical – don’t worry, you’re not the only one.</p>
      <p>Mr Vincenti said: “There's a huge divide before anyone tries it. We hear ‘yuck’, ‘oh my god’ and ‘no way’.</p>
      <p>“Then when they try it their faces turn – from closed, screwed-up eyes to wide open eyes and a smile. Followed by ‘oh yeah, it does taste like bacon'.”</p>

      <p>Mr Vincenti, 35, said the idea came about while trying to devise <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">festive flavour ideas</a> .</p>
      <p>“We were brainstorming Christmas flavour ideas and joking about how far we could take it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We then set about making pigs in blankets work.</p>
      <p>“Our friends and family all laughed but they are used to our crazy ideas and flavours, and said if anyone can make it work you guys can.”</p>

      <p>It’s just one of many eccentric flavours the ice-cream parlour has released over the years.</p>
      <p>They’ve also released ice creams that taste like Marmite, Big Macs and Guinness.</p>
      <p>The Vincents fell in love with gelato during a family holiday to Rome, and even took a university course about the dessert before opening their business in 2015.</p>
      <p>With their latest invention, the culinary couple have emulated celebrity chef <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/heston-blumenthal">Heston Blumenthal</a> , who has made headlines for wacky dishes including ice cream curry, the fish eyeball cocktail and snail porridge.</p>
