If you’re traveling across Canada and headed to Drumheller for your dinosaur fix, then a pit stop in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is a must. Just outside BN Steel & Metals resides an intricately sculpted Tyrannosaurus Rex replica, welded from cogs, springs, and other mechanical parts.
This stunning sculpture outside the metal recycling operation is accompanied by a pair of equally intricate Transformers, as well as an Earth sculpture.
The sculptures are often featured in photoshoots and frequently the subject of heart-felt pranks and other displays of endearment.
