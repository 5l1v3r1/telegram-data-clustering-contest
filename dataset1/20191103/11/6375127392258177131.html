      <h3>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Furkan Korkmaz drained a three pointer with less than a second on the clock as the Philadelphia 76ers rallied late to edge Portland 129-128 and remain the only unbeaten team in the new NBA season.</h3>
      <p>The 76ers are the last undefeated team in the league, going 5-0 to start the season for the first time since 2000-01.</p>
      <p>Anfernee Simons made a corner three-pointer with two seconds left to put the Trail Blazers in front but the Sixers got the ball back after a timeout. That set the stage for Korkmaz’s heroics as the Turkish shooting guard nailed a falling-down, 24-footer for the win.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to feel or how to act. It was the biggest shot of my career,” he said. “We were working on that in practice. I knew that if I was open I would take the shot”.</p>
      <p>The 76ers were playing without star Joel Embiid who was serving the first game of a two-game ban for fighting.</p>
      <p>The Blazers led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter but the Sixers closed the gap to 103-100 with just over 10 minutes left. Damian Lillard’s three-pointer with five minutes to go put Portland up 121-113 but the Sixers wouldn’t go away.</p>
      <p>Al Horford finished with 25 points and Tobias Harris added 23. Ben Simmons had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Lillard had 33 points, including eight of Portland’s 19 three pointers.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo flirted with a triple double as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the defending champion Toronto Raptors 115-105 in the first meeting between the clubs since last season’s Eastern Conference finals.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo scored 36 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and added eight assists for the Bucks, who built up a 26 point lead then held on for the victory.</p>
      <p>Eric Bledsoe added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Bucks, while Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each had 11 points.</p>
      <p>Kyle Lowry led Toronto with 36 points and Pascal Siakam had 16 points before fouling out late in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Fred VanVleet added 12 points, Serge Ibaka scored 11 and Marc Gasol tallied 10 points and 12 rebounds.</p>
      <p>The Raptors rallied in the fourth by cutting the lead to just four points but couldn’t win on the road.</p>
      <p>Also, Andrew Drummond finished with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds for the third consecutive game as the Detroit Pistons held on to beat the Brooklyn Nets 113-109.</p>
      <p>Drummond had 25 points to go with his 20 rebounds for the Pistons, who were playing their second game in as many nights.</p>
      <p>He added six assists and five blocks to go 20-20 for the fourth time in seven games.</p>
      <p>Bruce Brown added career highs of 22 points and seven assists, and Luke Kennard finished with 24 points and helped seal the win with a driving basket and two free throws in the final 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>The game was a series of runs by both teams with the Pistons taking a 14 point lead at one stage of the third after the Nets outscored Detroit by 15 in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving finished with a triple double, including 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Taurean Prince added 20 points and Joe Harris had 18.</p>
      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie hit a free throw with seven seconds remaining, and Drummond did the same with six seconds left to put the Pistons up 111-108.</p>
      <p>Prince then split a pair, missing the second on purpose, and Drummond grabbed the rebound and made a pair with three seconds left to clinch the victory.</p>
      <p>In San Francisco, Terry Rozier made a short go-ahead jumper then added two free throws with four seconds left and the Charlotte Hornets defeated the injury-riddled Golden State Warriors 93-87.</p>
      <p>Eric Paschall had a season-high 25 points for Golden State while starting in place of injured Draymond Green.</p>
      <p>Green suffered a torn ligament in his left index finger on Friday, joining a long list of injured Warriors including Stephen Curry, who underwent hand surgery this week and will be out for three months.</p>
