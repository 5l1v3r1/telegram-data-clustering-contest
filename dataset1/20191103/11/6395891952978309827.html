The group also sent 800 meals to area homeless shelters, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matthew-mcconaughey-and-wild-turkey-bourbon-team-up-with-operation-bbq-relief-to-prepare-meals-for-los-angeles-first-responders-300950271.html">the release said</a>.</p>
      <p>The event, originally meant to honor emergency workers who responded to the 2018 Woolsey Fire, recently changed focus as a new batch of fires broke out in the region.</p>
      <p>"Little did we know when planning this annual event that California, my second home, would once again be hit with devastating fires," McConaughey said, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/matthew-mcconaughey-and-wild-turkey-bourbon-team-up-with-operation-bbq-relief-to-prepare-meals-for-los-angeles-first-responders-300950271.html">according to the news release</a>. </p>
      <p>He added that he and the volunteers wanted to "say thank you, shine a light on [first responders'] unwavering conviction, and hopefully inspire others to get involved and help in their own communities."</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the Los Angeles Fire Department's Central Bureau <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Xpgx7htm6/">shared photos from the event</a> on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"Huge thank you to Operation BBQ relief and #matthewmcconaughey for donating trays of delicious BBQ to our crews around the city," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Xpgx7htm6/">the post read</a>.</p>
