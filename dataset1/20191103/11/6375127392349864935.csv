“MHPSS is a significant tool used in situation of violence, crisis, emergency and during armed conflicts to prevent psychological distress. “Yung incidence ng psychological problems ay lumalaki sa mga sitwasyong nagkakaroon ng calamity, gaya ng lindol at bagyo at  pangyayaring may kinalaman sa violence hindi lang sa mga lansangan kundi pati na rin sa mga paaraalan,” Janairo said.
“Yung incidence ng “bullying” sa mga schools, napakalaking epekto sa ating mga estudyante na biktima nito dahil sa araw-araw silang exposed sa ganitong violence ay nagkakaroon na sila ng takot at nawawalan ng ganang mag-aral at pumasok na kung minsan ay nauuwi sa kanilang pagpapakamatay,” he added.
Janairo emphasized that exposure to violence, loss of or separation from a loved one, friend or relative, and poverty can affect the well-being of a person, his/her family and the community which he/she resides.
The MHPSS training aims to provide mental health interventions to improve psychosocial well-being of a person by reducing the levels of psychological stress, improving daily functions, and ensure effective coping strategies.
