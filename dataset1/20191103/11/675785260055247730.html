      <h1>Mum's fury as Deliveroo charges her for KFC birthday feast but fails to deliver</h1>
      <h2>A mix-up when entering her address on the company's website left a mum-of-six hungry and £28.29 out of pocket</h2>

      <p>A mum has blasted Deliveroo after the firm failed to deliver a KFC meal meant as a birthday surprise for her daughter - but still charged her for it.</p>
      <p>Dawn Bayley, 38, complained to <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/mums-fury-after-deliveroo-fails-3457470">Stoke-on-Trent Live</a> that a mix-up when entering her address on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deliveroo">Deliveroo</a> website left her hungry and £28.29 out of pocket.</p>
      <p>She had intended to treat birthday girl Erica, 11, to a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kfc">fried chicken feast</a> , along with her sisters Tinisha-Jade, 12, two-year-old Alysia-Rose and their grandmother, Angela, 61.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Dawn, from Bucknall, near Stoke, had used Deliveroo.</p>
      <p>Having inadvertently entered both her current and former address, an unfortunate delivery driver was sent to the latter.</p>

      <p>A confused delivery driver angrily rebuked Dawn over the phone, telling her he could not deliver the meal to her current address - but that she would still be charged the full bill.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was going into hospital the next day, which was Erica’s birthday, so we decided to have her treat the night before and she wanted KFC.</p>
      <p>“I put this address in but my phone is linked to my old address... so it somehow changed to that one, but left both house numbers.</p>
      <p>“The delivery driver rang me because he had gone to [Dawn's previous address]. I realised what had happened and explained to him I was really sorry. I asked if he could still deliver it – I offered to pay extra for his fuel and said if it was cold it would be my fault, but he said he couldn’t and I wouldn’t be getting my payment back.</p>
      <p>"I don’t understand why no one called to check the address when there were two house numbers on the order – there was obviously some mistake.</p>
      <p>“I was really angry. The only reason for getting a takeaway was for my daughter’s birthday. I eventually ended up going on Just Eat and ordering pizza, and spending another £20.”</p>

      <p>Dawn added that a friend, who contacted Deliveroo on her behalf, was told she would indeed receive a refund.</p>
      <p>But the mother-of-six claimed that she had not been reimbursed until the company had been contacted by reporters.</p>
      <p>She has vowed never to use the food delivery service again.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was fuming. It’s daylight robbery. It was my technical error so if it turned up late and cold I didn’t mind that, but I should still get the food.</p>
      <p>“I usually use <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fast-food">Just Eat or Foodhub</a> and I’ve never had this problem with them. It was the first time and the last time I will use Deliveroo.”</p>

      <p>Dawn's mother, Angela added: "I think it's shocking, paying for something and then being told you can't have it. I won't use them again."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Deliveroo said the incident had been investigated, and that Dawn has now been issued with a refund.</p>
      <p>He said: “The query for this customer has now been answered and a full refund has been applied back to her card.”</p>
