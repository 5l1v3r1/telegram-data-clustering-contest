Viewers just can’t get enough of the Spider-Man franchise, and Sony hasn’t disappointed. The entertainment company just announced a date for a sequel to the popular animated feature film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”



The new movie is set to be released on April 8, 2022, but no other details have been announced. 



The original film received critical acclaim for its groundbreaking animation style and diverse storytelling. It even won an Oscar for best animated feature film. 
The movie tells the tale of Miles Morales, a young teen who takes the torch after Peter Parker is killed. But it differs from other Spider-Man films because it doesn’t focus solely on an origin story. Instead the movie opens up multiple universes where various Spider-People exist. 
In December, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that in addition to the Spider-Verse sequel, Sony is developing a female-centric spinoff.
