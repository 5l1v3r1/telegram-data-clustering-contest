蘋果、迪士尼進軍串流視頻 Netflix腹背受敵
03 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 熱話
迪士尼（Disney）、蘋果公司（Apple）及其他科技巨擘相繼進軍網上視頻平台業務的挑戰，影視串流市場競爭愈來愈激烈，過去幾年在影視串流平台領域獨大的Netflix，日後在吸引新訂閱用戶方面或帶來更大壓力。

Netflix 10月17日公布業績後，股價先升後挫，反映市場對於Netflix往後用戶增長，以及需要「燒錢」大幅增加在原創內容或取得影片版權支出，都存有憂慮。Netflix第三季業績顯示，季內新增訂閱用戶增長，遜該公司原先訂下的目標指引，但卻好過市場預期。其中，全球訂戶便按季淨增長677萬戶，高於市場預期的670萬戶，較去年同期的610萬戶增速也加快；但增長未及Netflix原先淨增700萬戶訂戶的目標。
在第三季，Netflix在美國市場訂戶情況改善，由第二季流失了12.6萬個訂戶，時隔一季後已重拾增長，增加51.7萬戶。然而，低於Netflix預期淨增80萬戶的目標。唯一高於Netflix所訂的目標，是國際訂戶增長625.5萬戶。加上市場慶幸美國訂戶重拾增長，在這份好壞參半的季績公布後，Netflix股價一度上升。
美國訂戶止跌回升
不過，投資者對Netflix前景的擔憂，很快已經蓋過樂觀情緒。10月17日該股股價向下，截至10月22日，收報266.69美元，再跌4%。Netflix第二季在美國市場流失客戶，主要原因是今年初曾受加價影響。該公司將高清計劃月費，由原來11美元升到13美元；不提供高清版的基本計劃，則由8美元上升到9美元。加價後，美國訂戶在第二季一度短暫流失， 是2011年以來首次訂戶按季減少的情況，但慶幸美國訂戶在第三季已止跌回升。
加價的影響消化後，市場又開始憂慮Netflix下一個挑戰，就是蘋果和迪士尼稍後進入串流媒體市場時，會否為Netflix帶來更大的壓力。強敵搶攻視頻串流市場，令人擔憂Netflix前景。蘋果及迪士尼推出自家視頻串流服務；AT&T從Netflix取回經典劇集《老友記》（Friends），都令市場憂慮削弱Netflix的競爭力。



去年兩度發債集資
而Netflix行政總裁黑斯廷斯（Reed Hastings），則試圖淡化新競爭湧現的威脅。他在致股東信函聲稱，其他科技巨擘進軍網上串流視頻業務，可能對集團短期收入增長帶來負面效應，但只有「輕微的阻力」。黑斯廷斯續稱，更多消費者使用相關服務，可以令市場規模變得更龐大，可加快觀眾從收看傳統電視，轉投選擇收看自選娛樂，長遠對該公司有利。Netflix過去大舉擴張，將資金大筆投入原創節目的製作與內容收購，以應對日益激烈的競爭。該公司去年便兩度在市場發債集資，滿足公司的資金需求。其如意算盤，是靠自家節目吸引更多訂戶，並藉加價提高邊際利潤。
例如Netflix的人氣劇集《怪奇物語》（Stranger Things），在今年8月推出第四季，成功吸引更多人訂閱。隨業界競爭加劇、影片成本上漲，Netflix預計今年為影片內容花費150億美元。面對蘋果和迪士尼將於11月起進入市場，Netflix也因此下調了今年的訂戶增長預測，預計2019年的新增訂戶只有2,670萬戶，低於去年的2,860萬戶。研究機構eMarketer則警告，新競爭者加入以後，對Netflix或相當不利。市場憂慮Netflix吸客及留客成本將持續攀升，以防止訂戶或轉至其他競爭者。

競爭者以平月費招徠
Netflix既要面對龐大的支出，但新入場的競爭者，卻以低價吸引訂戶，Netflix日後要再加價的難度增加。蘋果已在香港官網公布下週一（11月1日）上架的Apple TV+，可供訂戶免費試看七日。之後月費為38元，較目前Netflix最平的月費計劃63元，便宜近40%。另外，若購買蘋果旗下產品，可享一年Apple TV+ 訂閱服務。今年4月迪士尼公布Disney+串流影片訂閱服務將於11月12日推出。且月費將低至6.99美元，也較Netflix的基本計劃月費9美元更便宜平。
在市場競爭下，Netflix或難以直接加價，但有傳該公司試圖以更嚴格限制用戶的賬戶共享方式，導致變相加價。目前Netflix對於賬戶共享的內容，主要限制一個賬戶內同時上線的裝置數目。有傳Netflix將共享方式收窄，至一個賬戶僅能在同一建築內，例如用戶的家中同時使用，令朋友間難以再共用一個賬戶。此外，串流市場的競爭愈來愈激烈，Netflix也遭到競爭者封殺。迪士尼決定禁止旗下的美國廣播公司（ABC）、FX和國家地理頻道等播放Netflix的廣告。不過，市場預料迪士尼此舉對Netflix其實影響不大。因為Netflix更依賴網上廣告，而非傳統媒體；此外，Netflix還有其他宣傳渠道，如大型廣告牌及其他電視頻道等。

Apple, Disney enters streaming video Netflix is attacked by the enemy
03 Nov 2019, 08:00 by hot words
Disney, Apple and other technology giants have successively entered the challenge of online video platform business. The competition in the video streaming market is becoming more and more fierce. In the past few years, Netflix, which is the largest in the field of video streaming platforms, is in the future. It may put more pressure on attracting new subscribers.

After Netflix announced its results on October 17, the stock price rose first and then fell, reflecting the market's concern about Netflix's future user growth, as well as the need to ""burn money"" to significantly increase the original content or obtain copyright fees for the film. Netflix's third-quarter results showed that the growth of new subscribers during the quarter was inferior to the company's original target guidelines, but better than market expectations. Among them, global subscribers increased by 6.77 million quarter-on-quarter, which was higher than the market expectation of 6.7 million, which was faster than the 6.1 million in the same period last year. However, the growth was not the same as Netflix's original net increase of 7 million subscribers.
In the third quarter, Netflix's subscribers in the US market improved, with 126,000 subscribers lost in the second quarter, and after a lapse of quarters, growth has increased, adding 517,000. However, below Netflix's target of a net increase of 800,000. The only target higher than Netflix's goal is an increase of 6.255 million international subscribers. Coupled with the market's gratitude to US subscribers to regain growth, Netflix's share price has risen after this mixed quarterly results announcement.
US subscribers rebounded
However, investors' concerns about the prospects of Netflix have quickly overshadowed optimism. On October 17, the stock price went down. As of October 22, it closed at 266.69 USD and fell 4%. Netflix lost customers in the US market in the second quarter, mainly because of the price increase at the beginning of this year. The company raised the monthly fee for the HD program from $11 to $13; from the basic plan for the HD version, it rose from $8 to $9. After the fare increase, US subscribers briefly lost in the second quarter, which is the first quarterly decrease in subscribers since 2011, but fortunately US subscribers have stopped falling in the third quarter.
After the impact of the price increase, the market began to worry about Netflix's next challenge, whether Apple and Disney will put more pressure on Netflix when they enter the streaming media market later. Strong enemy rushing into the video streaming market is worrying about Netflix's prospects. Apple and Disney launched their own video streaming service; AT&T retrieved the classic episode ""Friends"" from Netflix, which caused market worries to undermine Netflix's competitiveness.



Two years of debt issuance
Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings is trying to downplay the threat of new competition. In a letter to shareholders, he claimed that other technology giants entering the online streaming video business may have a negative effect on the Group's short-term revenue growth, but only ""slight resistance."" Hastings continued that more consumers use related services, which can make the market bigger, and speed up the audience from watching traditional TV, switching to choose entertainment, and benefiting the company in the long run. In the past, Netflix expanded its capital and invested heavily in the production of original programs and content acquisitions in response to increasing competition. The company twice raised funds in the market last year to meet the company's funding needs. The wishful thinking is to attract more subscribers by their own programs and increase the marginal profit by increasing the fare.
For example, Netflix's popular drama ""Stranger Things"", launched in the fourth quarter of this year, successfully attracted more people to subscribe. As competition in the industry intensifies and film costs rise, Netflix expects to spend $15 billion on video content this year. In the face of Apple and Disney will enter the market in November, Netflix has also lowered its subscriber growth forecast for this year. It is estimated that there will be only 26.7 million new subscribers in 2019, down from 28.6 million last year. Research firm eMarketer warned that new competitors would be quite unfavorable to Netflix after joining. Market worries that Netflix's customer and guest costs will continue to climb to prevent subscribers or to other competitors.

Competitors recruit for flat monthly fees
Netflix has to face huge expenditures, but new competitors attract low-priced subscribers, and Netflix will increase the difficulty of further price increases in the future. Apple has announced on the Hong Kong official website the Apple TV+, which will be available next Monday (November 1), for subscribers to try for free for seven days. After that, the monthly fee is 38 yuan, which is nearly 40% cheaper than the current Netflix's most flat monthly plan of 63 yuan. In addition, if you purchase Apple products, you can enjoy one year of Apple TV+ subscription service. In April this year, Disney announced that the Disney+ streaming video subscription service will be launched on November 12. And the monthly fee will be as low as $6.99, which is also cheaper than Netflix's basic plan monthly fee of $9.
In the market competition, Netflix may not be able to directly increase the price, but it is said that the company is trying to restrict the user's account sharing method more strictly, resulting in a price increase in disguise. At present, Netflix's content shared by accounts mainly limits the number of devices that are online at the same time in one account. It is said that Netflix narrows the sharing method to an account that can only be used in the same building, such as the user's home, making it difficult for friends to share an account. In addition, the competition in the streaming market has become increasingly fierce, and Netflix has also been blocked by competitors. Disney decided to ban the broadcast of Netflix ads from its ABC, FX and National Geographic channels. However, the market expects Disney's move to have little impact on Netflix. Because Netflix relies more on online advertising than on traditional media; in addition, Netflix has other promotional channels, such as large billboards and other TV channels.
