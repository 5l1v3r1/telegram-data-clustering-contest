資深演員李興文之子李堉睿日前深夜大鬧知名傢俱賣場「IKEA」敦化店，還裸體直播，遭警方以妨害風化、無故侵入建築物查辦。聽聞此事的藝人吳宗憲以「過來人」之姿表示，「哪有兒子不闖禍？」並開玩笑表示要是換成是他：「我就把IKEA買下來」。

李堉睿繼去年直播「吸麻無害」後，日前也闖之名傢俱賣場還裸體直播再度引起熱議。星二代屢屢出包，知名主持人吳宗憲感受最深，今（3）日他出席活動時自嘲說：「星二代一直出事也不是辦法，我最有資格說這句話，因為鹿西派也出事啦！」吳宗憲透露事發後有致電給曾上過他節目的李興文給予安慰，直言「哪有兒子不闖禍」，並表示會協助排解，他在電話中還不改搞笑天王個性，跟李興文說：「去IKEA把東西弄壞不對，那下次改去力麗傢俱。」
而兒子闖禍至今，李興文至今都未對外說明，據悉事發後李堉睿被老爸唸了一頓，但仍不知悔改，堅持「做自己」。昨日下午前往警局接受約談時甚至向媒體表示裸體畫面是「藝術」，而他的確也因為這事件讓自己的YouTube頻道粉絲暴增兩倍。

Li Xingru, the son of senior actor Li Xingwen, recently screamed at the famous furniture store ""IKEA"" Dunhua store in the middle of the night. He was also broadcast live naked and was investigated by the police for influencing weathering and intrusion into the building for no reason. Wu Zongxian, an artist who heard about this, said, ""Where is the son?"" and joked that if he changed to him: ""I will buy IKEA.""

After Li Weirui’s live broadcast of “Natural and Innocent” last year, the name of the furniture store was also naked. The second generation of the star has repeatedly been out of the package. The well-known host Wu Zongxian feels the deepest. Today, he (3), when he attended the event, he laughed himself: ""The second generation of the star has not been a problem. I am most qualified to say this because the Luxi faction also has an accident. After the incident, Wu Zongxian said that he had given a call to Li Xingwen who had been on his show to give comfort. He bluntly said, ""Which son has no trouble,"" he said that he would assist in the resolution. He did not change the personality of the funny king on the phone, and said with Li Xingwen. ""When I go to IKEA to get things broken, I will change to Lili Furniture next time.""
However, Li Xingwen has not explained it to the public so far. It is reported that Li Ruirui was read by his father after the incident, but he still does not know how to repent and insists on ""doing himself."" When I went to the police station to accept the interview yesterday afternoon, I even told the media that the nude picture was ""art"", and he did indeed double the number of fans of his YouTube channel because of this incident.
