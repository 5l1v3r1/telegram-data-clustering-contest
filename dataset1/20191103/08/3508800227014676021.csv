怎麼讓孩子好好寫功課？專家：從訓練孩子專心、負責開始
03 Nov 2019, 08:00 by BabyHome


我們想讓你知道的是現在孩子要專心，不是一直要求就可以的，必須要找出孩子的動機才行，也就是要他覺得專心是有趣的！



文：張旭鎧（阿鎧老師）
小學孩子讀半天時，怎麼讓他好好寫功課？
Q：女兒從幼稚園開始很難專心（除了她有興趣的事），到現在小四了還是一樣，每天總會忘記帶一些東西回家（便當、外套、習作或學習單等），功課幾乎都需要我盯 著才能完成。她週三和週五讀半天，由於我是單親家庭，只能放她自己寫功課，由小六的姊姊幫忙稍微盯著。但因為姊姊的功課也愈來愈繁重，根本無暇顧到妹妹， 我到底該如何改善這樣的情況？
A：當孩子寫功課不專心時，我們總會習慣在孩子身邊監督著，然後希望孩子自動自發的「專心」。但事實上，我們變成了孩子的「助理」，當孩子拿出課本、習作和鉛筆後就開始玩玩具，我們會要他開始寫功課，寫到一半又發呆，我們又要求他繼續寫……這整個過程中，孩子根本不必為自己有沒有專心負責任，最後造成孩子不僅不專心，甚至失去責任感與自我控制能力。
把專心的責任交還給孩子吧！我們可以從兩方面著手：
一、準備倒數計時器，當孩子寫功課時，先從五分鐘開始，要求孩子在這段時間內完成指定的功課，接著按下倒數計時器，媽 媽（或姊姊）就可以離開，等五分鐘到了再來檢討孩子的表現。孩子會發現，要做得好才能夠休息、才能夠快一點把所有功課寫完，計時的時間可以從五分鐘慢慢增加。這樣的做法不僅讓孩子學會規劃自己寫作業的速度，更可以延長他專注力的持續時間。
二、幫孩子準備備忘表，列出孩子會忘記帶的東西，要求孩子在固定的時間（如睡覺前、出門上學前、放學前、離開安親班前等）將備忘表拿出來檢查，確定東西都帶齊了、事情都完成了！讓孩子養成固定檢查的習慣，大腦就會逐漸將這樣的作業內化，將來孩子就會自動記得該帶的東西，不再需要備忘表的協助。
現在孩子要專心，不是一直要求就可以的，必須要找出孩子的動機才行，也就是要他覺得專心是有趣的！除了簡單的專心寫作業可以獲得獎賞外，最重要的是要讓孩子從寫作業及記得帶東西的過程中獲得成就感，他才會持續的專心下去。

How do you let your child write homework? Expert: From the training of children to concentrate and responsible
03 Nov 2019, 08:00 by BabyHome


What we want you to know is that now the child has to concentrate, not always ask for it, you must find out the child's motivation, that is, he thinks that concentration is interesting!



Text: Zhang Xuyu (teacher Aunt)
When the elementary school child is reading for a long time, how can he let him write his homework well?
Q: It is difficult for my daughter to concentrate from kindergarten (except for things she is interested in). Until now, she is still the same. She always forgets to bring some things home (bench, coat, study or study list, etc.), almost all her homework. I need to stare to complete. She read for a long time on Wednesday and Friday. Since I am a single-parent family, I can only put her own homework, and I am a little stared by Xiao’s help. However, because my homework is getting more and more heavy, I have no time to look after my sister. How can I improve this situation?
A: When a child writes homework without paying attention, we always get used to supervising the child, and then hope that the child will spontaneously concentrate on ""concentration."" But in fact, we became the ""assistant"" of the child. When the child took out the textbook, the work and the pencil, he started playing with the toy. We would ask him to start writing his homework, half written again, and we asked him to continue writing... Throughout this process, the child does not have to concentrate on his own responsibility. In the end, the child not only does not concentrate, but also loses the sense of responsibility and self-control.
Return thetentive responsibility to the child! We can start from two aspects:
First, prepare the countdown timer. When the child writes homework, start with five minutes and ask the child to complete the specified homework during this time. Then press the countdown timer, and the mother (or 姊姊) can leave, wait for five. Minutes are coming to review the child's performance. The child will find that if you have to do well, you can rest, and you can finish all your homework faster. The time of counting can be gradually increased from five minutes. This approach not only allows the child to learn how to plan his own homework, but also to extend the duration of his concentration.
Second, help the child prepare a memorandum list, list the things that the child will forget to bring, and ask the child to take out the memorandum form at a fixed time (such as before going to bed, before going to school, before leaving school, before leaving the class, etc.) Things are brought together and things are done! Let the child develop the habit of fixed examination, the brain will gradually internalize such work, the child will automatically remember the things in the future, no longer need the assistance of the memo table.
Now the child has to concentrate, not always ask for it, you must find out the child's motivation, that is, he wants to concentrate is fun! In addition to the simple focus on writing assignments to get rewards, the most important thing is to let the child get a sense of accomplishment from the process of writing homework and remembering to bring things, he will continue to concentrate.
