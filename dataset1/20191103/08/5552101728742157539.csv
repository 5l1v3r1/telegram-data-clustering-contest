神級酒款他都有！威士忌初代KOL　K大酒窖揭密
03 Nov 2019, 08:57 by 李莘于, 何宗昇
即將於11/9、11/10在台北華山舉辦的「Whisky Live Taipei」，堂堂邁入10週年，而讓台灣成為單一麥芽威士忌強權，威士忌專家們功不可沒。其中，人稱K大，被蘇格蘭威士忌酒界頒發The Master of the Quaich （蘇格蘭雙耳小酒杯執持者大師）的姚和成，是業界公認的大師級人物，也是早期推動威士忌浪潮的先鋒達人。我們請他挑出生命中最特別的10瓶威士忌，說說酒標背後的故事。
循著階梯下樓，冷涼的空氣裡瀰漫如酒窖透出的濕冷氣息，威士忌高低錯落的堆疊著，幾乎沒有立足之地。這位威士忌首席達人的私人小酒窖，沒有大器酒櫃並排，而是以簡單的木板釘成，其中擺放「雅柏（Ardbeg） 」那排還微微下陷。「放心，那個不會塌啦！」姚和成看出我們眼裡的擔心，順道從一個小巧的雪莉桶中取出一杯威士忌遞給我。


酒窖裡的小雪莉桶裡酒液已浸潤調和過四家不同威士忌，現在是「高原騎士」。

赭紅色的酒液來自不只一家酒廠，「這種桶叫Living cask。」姚和成解釋，早期在蘇格蘭，雜貨店賣茶也賣酒，他們運用拼配茶的方式，來調和店裡的單一麥芽威士忌，像這樣一個橡木桶裡，可能不斷填充不同酒廠的威士忌。當桶中的酒快沒的時候，他會再倒入其他酒廠的威士忌繼續養桶，有點像自家調和的概念，酒喝不完，就淋在桶上潤桶，說明了為何滿室馨香。


姚和成的酒櫃以簡單的木板釘成，藏了許多珍稀酒款。

在這攝氏15度的酒窖裡，平價普飲款與神級蒐藏款混雜一室，他的蒐藏裡有山崎50年、麥卡倫珍稀1946年白金版...等拍賣場上的天價酒款，「我幾乎不賣酒也不換酒，願望就是要在死之前把所有威士忌都喝掉。」姚和成笑說。


「百富10年Founder's Reserve 」這支酒開啟了姚和成研究單一麥芽威士忌之路。



「山崎1984」是山崎酒廠25周年的紀念酒款，屢獲國際大獎。

　
百富10年啟蒙　威士忌迎來達人世代
台灣是單一麥芽威士忌市場的強權，全球排名第四。而這股風潮當初是由像姚和成這群無心插柳的達人帶起來。他初嚐單一麥芽威士忌，是菸酒仍屬公賣的年代，表姊從英國帶回一瓶「百富（BALVENIE）10年」，那時沒有網路、沒有相關書籍，他還翻牛津字典查什麼叫「單一麥芽威士忌」。


「The Michael Jackson Special Blend」是威士忌大師Michael Jackson過世後，將他留下的樣品酒調和裝瓶而成的紀念酒，限量1千瓶。



「雅柏 25年 1975 DL OMC 702B」是被國際權威品飲組織「Malt Maniacs 麥芽狂人俱樂部」評為滿分的酒。

在美國念MBA時，姚和成讀了權威作家Michael Jackson的 《Malt Whisky Companion》 ，此書率先開始將威士忌評分，他就跟著按圖索驥，買酒、品飲、寫筆記，沒想到日後，他成為Michael Jackson《威士忌全書》中文版的譯者。「Michael Jackson過世之後，還留下許多沒喝完的樣品酒，後來知名獨立裝瓶廠BBR貝瑞兄弟（Berry Bros & Rudd）就把這批樣酒調和後，裝成1千瓶做公益拍賣。」當然，這麼有紀念性的酒，他手邊也有。


台灣單一麥芽研究社成立初期，日本三得利威士忌首席調酒師輿水精一來台交流合影。

2002年回到台灣，正逢網路興起，姚和成開始以Kingfisher為名成立部落格發表文章，一開始很孤單，大家都喝葡萄酒，後來才循線找到一群威士忌品酒同好，05年成立了「台灣單一麥芽威士忌品酒研究社」（TSMWTA），以他為首，成員許多都是理工背景，他們品酒、查資料、寫筆記，而不只是狂飲，這些認真的達人們形成一股巨大能量，連結台灣與遙遠蘇格蘭威士忌酒廠的關係，讓原廠開始在意起這個遠在天邊的市場。


姚和成曾任國際知名威士忌大獎「麥芽狂人競賽」（MMA）評審，是當年唯一一位華人。



姚和成蒐集了許多自己出生年份的酒，如這支70年代的「麥卡倫18年」。

現在流行講KOL（Key opinion leader，意見領袖），在威士忌界，姚和成就是「初代KOL」。早期籌備社團時，他便積極與國外威士忌愛好者互動，04年被找進國際威士忌品飲組織「Malt Maniacs 麥芽狂人俱樂部」，並擔任年度競賽常任評審。麥芽狂人競賽當初是為了反制國際「分豬肉」型的烈酒競賽，在非營利的模式下舉辦，因此在酒迷心目中的地位崇高，姚和成也成了其中罕見的亞洲代表。


黛安娜王妃與查爾斯王子結婚時，「麥卡倫」特地出了這支「皇家婚禮」威士忌，以兩人的出生年份酒調和。



美國版「拉弗格30年」是唯一重雪莉的版本，沈穩豐富的木質調。

　
神級蒐藏　偏愛老年份髒髒酒
姚和成陸續拿出許多蒐藏酒，如一支與英國皇室有關的婚禮酒，是「麥卡倫」為了慶賀查爾斯王子與黛安娜王妃結婚時出的紀念威士忌，「『Marriage』在威士忌的意思是調和，所以是用兩人出生年份的酒來做調和。」雖然佳偶成了怨偶，但威士忌酒香永流傳。
另一支「拉弗格（Laphroaig）30年」是750毫升的美國版，「這是所有拉弗格30年唯一的重雪莉版本，一般人不曉得。」那時他讀了一本寫艾雷島酒廠的書，作者提到拉弗格30年這批裝瓶都是罕見的雪莉桶，「拉弗格的年輕款其實比較有香草的碘味，但是30年會有比較多泥土、木質調性，碘味被淡化了，變得沉穩豐富。」


1955年蒸餾的「高原騎士」有姚和成所喜歡老年份酒的複雜感。

「這支高原騎士（Highland Park）是我評分給最高的版本。」姚和成拿出一瓶由Gordon & MacPhail所裝瓶「高原騎士1955」，1955是蒸餾年份，「老年份的酒會有泥土、蕈類的風味，我覺得是因為那時的麥芽沒那麼好，現在的麥芽都太乾淨，老麥芽有雜味，因此造成複雜感。像是1970年代的雅柏單桶，有一點髒髒的感覺，我比較喜歡。」


為了拯救坎貝爾鎮免於在產地上「被消失」，當地的「雲頂」酒廠特地推出在地麥芽製作的威士忌。

還有一支「雲頂（Spring bank）West Highland」威士忌的由來也很有趣，在威士忌六大產區中，曾風光一時的坎貝爾鎮因為酒廠稀少，漸漸被人遺忘，為了避免在產地圖上「被消失」，當地的「雲頂」酒廠特地推出在地麥芽製作的Local Barley系列（早期出產稱West Highland）威士忌，要高調喚起大家對此產區的注意，「我也因為這支酒與歐洲藏家結緣，當時雲頂有一半的酒都是台灣買的。」


這支來自「波特艾倫」1983年關廠前的威士忌，貼上印有翠鳥的背標，象徵姚和成的個人選桶「Kingfisher Selection」



已關廠的波特艾倫威士忌，是威士忌迷心中的夢幻逸品。

許多人仰賴姚和成的專業，他經常幫人選桶裝瓶，然真正屬於自己的選桶卻只有三支，會在背標貼上「Kingfisher Selection」。第一支是來自艾雷島傳奇酒廠「波特艾倫Port Ellen」雪莉桶，「當初也是幫別人選桶，但當時波特艾倫還沒那麼有名，泥煤風味也不好賣，但我很喜歡，所以乾脆自己。
買下來。」第二支他則選了台灣的「噶瑪蘭Kavalan雪莉桶」「我覺得身為台灣的國際品飲家，自選系列也應該要有一款台灣的威士忌，這桶的姊妹桶後來也連續4、5年得麥芽狂人競賽的金牌。」第三支則是他初次去艾雷島「布萊迪」（Bruichladdich）酒廠實習一週時的裝瓶，擁有自己的心血。
　
逛酒展長知識　達人預測小廠出頭天
而一般人不是蒐藏家，如何能嘗試到特別的酒款，進而了解威士忌更多面向？推動酒展，就成了當時達人們的解方。
回溯台灣單一麥芽威士忌發展的契機，「千禧年是單一麥芽威士忌熱潮在世界爆發的開始，那時大家有股想要與眾不同的氣氛，有網路之後，知識傳播變得容易，比起白蘭地的調和工藝，單一麥芽威士忌的製程有更多的內容可以說。」姚和成分析，還有一個極關鍵的因素，就是酒廠也發現，求知若渴的消費者開始藉由網路這條線來尋找商品，有別傳統偏向投放廣告的單向行銷，單一麥芽威士忌酒廠更具有以知識來吸引消費者的魅力。而酒展，就是直接面對大眾的最好管道。
「威士忌酒展會有很多『大師講堂』，品牌大使、調酒師們很愛來交流，消費者也很想學習，二邊都很興奮，酒展其實是能夠迅速累積知識的地方。」姚和成說。年度最大型的國際烈酒展Whisky Live Taipei 即將邁入第十年，身為推手之一的姚和成，除了在「台灣單一麥芽研究社」舉辦的講座上帶領大眾品飲社團精選酒款，由他代理的「HIGH COAST（原BOX）瑞典高岸單一麥芽威士忌」也將參展。


這支重泥煤的瑞典「BOX」（現更名為HIGH COAST）威士忌，是「台灣單一麥芽研究社」路跑隊的裝瓶。



姚和成近年熱衷路跑，認為路跑與品酒都一樣能讓心靈沉澱。圖為2017年參加芝加哥城市馬拉松。（姚和成提供）

我好奇為何蘇格蘭威士忌的大師卻去代理冷門的北歐威士忌，原來在布萊迪酒廠實習那次，也讓他認識了HIGH COAST威士忌廠長兼調酒師。「他的東西很有特色，我們不需要去挑戰蘇格蘭威士忌，但我覺得小眾在台灣這樣成熟的環境是一直有市場的。」姚和成說。
也因為調酒師是機械工程師背景，他們做很多實驗性的產品，好比會用4種不同的橡木（Quercus）桶來過桶陳年，探究橡木桶對酒風味帶來的影響，這些特別的商品，在酒展上都有機會能體驗。「其實未來各地會有更多有趣的小酒廠冒出來，包括蘇格蘭本身。」姚和成說，小廠不必去競爭主流市場，但玩心很大，這些實驗性產品將是未來威士忌值得關注的趨勢。

He has a god-grade wine! Whisky first generation KOL K big wine cellar reveals
03 Nov 2019, 08:57 by Li Yuyu, He Zongsheng
The “Whisky Live Taipei”, which will be held in Huashan, Taipei on 11/9 and 11/10, will enter the 10th anniversary and make Taiwan a single malt whisky. Whisky experts are indispensable. Among them, Yao Hecheng, who is known as K-King and awarded The Master of the Quaich by the Scotch Whisky World, is a recognized master in the industry and a pioneer in the early promotion of the whisky wave. We asked him to pick out the most special 10 bottles of whisky in his life and talk about the story behind the wine label.
Follow the steps downstairs, the cold air filled with the cold and cold smell of the wine cellar, the stack of whisky is high and low, almost no place to stand. The whisky chief's private cellar, without a large wine cabinet side by side, was nailed with simple wooden boards, in which the ""Ardbeg"" row was slightly sunken. ""Reassure, that won't collapse!"" Yao Hecheng saw the fear in our eyes, and took a whiskey from a small sherry bucket and handed it to me.


The wine in the Shirley bucket in the cellar has been infiltrated and blended with four different whiskies. It is now a ""plateau knight"".

The crimson wine comes from more than one winery. ""This kind of barrel is called Living cask."" Yao Hecheng explained that in Scotland in the early days, the grocery store sells tea and sells wine. They use the method of blending tea to reconcile the single wheat in the store. Bud whiskey, like this in an oak barrel, may constantly fill the whiskies of different wineries. When the wine in the bucket is almost gone, he will pour into the whisky of other wineries to continue to raise the barrel. It is a bit like the concept of self-conciliation. When the wine is not finished, it will be poured into the barrel and the bucket will be filled. .


Yao Hecheng's wine cabinet is made of simple wooden boards and contains many rare wines.

In this wine cellar of 15 degrees Celsius, the cheap Pu-Drinks and the God-class collections are mixed together. His collection includes the auction of Yamazaki 50 years, McAllen Rare 1946 Platinum Edition, etc. The price is high, ""I almost don't sell alcohol or change the wine. The wish is to drink all the whiskey before I die."" Yao and Cheng said with a smile.


The wine of ""Founder's Reserve for 10 Years"" opened Yao Hecheng's road to study single malt whisky.



""Mountain 1984"" is the commemorative wine of the 25th anniversary of Yamazaki Winery and has won numerous international awards.


The 10th Anniversary of the Riches, the whisky welcomes generations
Taiwan is the power of the single malt whisky market, ranking fourth in the world. This trend was originally brought up by a group of people like Yao Hecheng who had no heart. He first tasted a single malt whisky. It was the era when tobacco and alcohol were still sold. The watch brought back a bottle of ""BALVENIE"" for 10 years from the UK. At that time, there was no internet, no related books, and he also turned to Oxford. The dictionary looks at what is called ""single malt whisky.""


""The Michael Jackson Special Blend"" is a commemorative wine made from whiskey master Michael Jackson after the death of his sample, and a limited edition of 1,000 bottles.



""Yabo 25th 1975 DL OMC 702B"" is a wine that has been awarded the full score by the international authoritative drink organization ""Malt Maniacs Malt Mania Club"".

When he was an MBA in the United States, Yao Hecheng read the authoritative writer Michael Jackson's ""Malt Whisky Companion"", which was the first to start scoring whiskey. He followed the picture, bought wine, drinks, and wrote notes. He did not expect him to become Michael Jackson in the future. The translator of the Chinese version of ""Whiskey Book"". ""After Michael Jackson passed away, there were still many sample wines that had not been finished. Later, Berry Bros & Rudd, a well-known independent bottling plant, reconciled the samples and put them into 1,000 bottles for public auction. ""Of course, such a commemorative wine, he also has it.""


At the beginning of the establishment of Taiwan's Single Malt Research Institute, the chief bartender of Japan's Suntory whisky, Shui Shui Jing, came to Taiwan to take a group photo.

When I returned to Taiwan in 2002, it was the rise of the Internet. Yao Hecheng began to publish blogs in the name of Kingfisher. At the beginning, he was very lonely. Everyone drank wine. Later, he found a group of whiskeys and wine tastings. He established in 2005. Taiwan Single Malt Whisky Tasting Research Institute (TSMWTA), headed by him, many members are in the background of science and technology, they wine tasting, checking materials, writing notes, not just drinking, these serious people form a huge Energy, linking Taiwan's relationship with the distant Scotch Whisky Distillery, let the original factory begin to care about this market far from the horizon.


Yao Hecheng was the judge of the internationally renowned whisky award ""Mad Madman Competition"" (MMA) and was the only Chinese in the year.



Yao Hecheng collected a lot of wines of his own birth year, such as the ""McAllen 18 years"" in the 1970s.

Nowadays, KOL (Key opinion leader) is popular. In the whisky world, Yao and his achievements are ""the first generation KOL."" When he was preparing for the club in the early days, he actively interacted with foreign whisky lovers. In 2004, he was recruited into the international whisky drink organization ""Malt Maniacs Malt Madman Club"" and served as the permanent judge of the annual competition. The Malt madman competition was originally designed to counter the international ""powder-cut"" type of spirits competition, and was held in a non-profit mode. Therefore, the status of the fans is high, and Yao Hecheng has become a rare representative of Asia.


When Princess Diana married Prince Charles, ""McCarlan"" specially made this ""Royal Wedding"" whisky, which was reconciled with the wine of the two years of birth.



The US version of ""Lafferg 30 Years"" is the only version of Shirley, a calm and rich wood tone.


God-level search, prefer the old vintage dirty wine
Yao Hecheng has successively produced a lot of wines, such as a wedding wine related to the British royal family. It is a commemorative whisky for ""McKaren"" to celebrate the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana. ""Marriage means harmony in whiskey."" Therefore, it is to use the wine of the two years of birth to make a reconciliation."" Although the couple became a grievance, the whisky fragrance was circulated forever.
Another ""Laphroaig 30 Years"" is the American version of 750 ml. ""This is the only heavy snowy version of Lafuge's 30 years. Most people don't know."" At that time he read a copy of Ai. The book of Leidao Winery, the author mentioned that Lafuge’s 30-year bottle is a rare sherry bucket. ""Laffer’s younger style actually has the iodine taste of vanilla, but there will be more soil in 30 years. Woody tonality, iodine taste is diluted, and it becomes calm and rich.""


The ""plateau knight"" distilled in 1955 has the complexity of the old vintage that Yao Hecheng likes.

""This Highland Park is the highest version I have rated."" Yao Hecheng took out a bottle of Gordon & MacPhail bottled ""Plateau Knight 1955"", 1955 is the year of distillation, ""The old vintage will have dirt, 蕈The flavor of the class, I think it is because the malt was not so good at the time, the malt is too clean now, the old malt has a odor, so it creates a complex feeling. Like the Yabai single barrel in the 1970s, it is a bit dirty. I feel like dirty feelings.""


In order to save Campbell town from being “disappeared” in the production area, the local “Genting” winery specially launched whiskey made from malt.

There is also a ""Spring Bank"" West Highland whisky that is also very interesting. In the six major whisky producing areas, the once-popular Campbell town was gradually forgotten because of the sparseness of the winery, in order to avoid ""on the map of production."" It was disappeared. The local ""Genting"" winery specially launched the Local Barley series (early known as West Highland) whisky made in the local malt. It should be high-profile to arouse the attention of this region. ""I also because of this wine and European collectors became attached, and half of the wines in Genting were bought in Taiwan.""


This whiskey from ""Porter Allen"" before the factory closed in 1983, with the back of the kingfisher on it, symbolizes Yao Hecheng's personal selection of ""Kingfisher Selection""



The Porter Allen whiskey, which has been shut down, is a dreamy product in whisky.

Many people rely on Yao Hecheng's profession. He often helps people choose barrels and bottles. However, there are only three barrels that are really their own. They will be labeled ""Kingfisher Selection"" on the back label. The first one was from Shirley Barrel, Porter Allen's legendary winery, ""I was also helping others to choose barrels, but at the time, Porter Allen was not so famous, and the peat flavor was not good. But I like it very much, so simply be yourself.
Buy it. The second one chose Taiwan's ""Kamalan Shili barrel"". ""I think that as an international drinker in Taiwan, the self-selected series should also have a Taiwanese whisky. This bucket of sister barrels is also continuous. 4, 5 years to get the gold medal in the malt madman competition."" The third is his first time to go to the ""Island"" ""Bruichladdich"" winery internship for a week of bottling, has his own efforts.

Visiting wine exhibition leader knowledge
The average person is not a collector. How can I try a special wine and learn more about whiskey? Promoting the wine show became the solution for the people at that time.
Looking back at the development of Taiwan's single malt whisky, ""The millennium is the beginning of a single malt whisky boom in the world. At that time, everyone had a different atmosphere. When there is a network, knowledge transfer becomes easier. Compared to the blending process of brandy, the process of single malt whisky has more content to say.” Yao Hecheng analysis, there is also a very critical factor, that is, the winery also found that consumers who are thirsty for knowledge began to use the Internet. This line is looking for merchandise. There is a one-way marketing that traditionally prefers to advertise. The single malt whisky has the charm of attracting consumers with knowledge. The wine show is the best channel to face the public directly.
""The Whisky Show has a lot of ""Masters' Halls"". Brand ambassadors and bartenders love to communicate. Consumers also want to learn. The two sides are very excited. The wine show is actually a place where knowledge can be quickly accumulated."" Yao Hecheng said . Whisky Live Taipei, the largest international spirits show of the year, is about to enter its tenth year. Yao Hecheng, one of the promoters, will lead the public drink group to select wines in addition to the lecture held at the Taiwan Single Malt Research Society. His ""HIGH COAST (original BOX) Swedish high bank single malt whisky"" will also be exhibited.


This heavy peat Swedish ""BOX"" (now renamed HIGH COAST) whiskey is the bottle of the ""Taiwan Single Malt Research Society"" road running team.



Yao Hecheng has been keen on running in recent years, thinking that road running and wine tasting can make the mind settle. The picture shows the participation in the Chicago City Marathon in 2017. (Provided by Yao Hecheng)

I was curious as to why the master of the Scotch whisky went to represent the unpopular Scandinavian whiskey. He also had an internship at the Brady Winery and made him know the COCO whisky director and bartender. ""His things are very special. We don't need to challenge Scotch whisky, but I think the niche is always in a mature environment in Taiwan."" Yao Hecheng said.
Also because the bartenders are the background of mechanical engineers, they do a lot of experimental products, such as the use of four different oak (Quercus) barrels to age over the barrel, to explore the impact of oak barrels on the flavor of the wine, these special Commodities have a chance to experience at the wine show. ""In fact, there will be more interesting small wineries coming out in the future, including Scotland itself."" Yao Hecheng said that small factories do not have to compete in the mainstream market, but they are very interesting. These experimental products will be worthy of attention in future whiskies. trend.
