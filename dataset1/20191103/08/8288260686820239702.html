      <p>Nicole Scherzinger has left X Factor Celebrity viewers stunned - after breaking the rules of the show live on air.</p>
      <p>The Pussycat Dolls singer broke the rules on Saturday night as millions tuned into the ITV1 show on November.</p>
      <p>Controversially, Nicole decided to go against her own acts - and decided to give group Try Star her safe seat.</p>
      <p>Nicole's chair was given to the lads after an emotional performance of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.</p>

      <p>Eddie Jones's side went down to the southern hemisphere side in Japan, losing at Yokohama Stadium.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Try Star are made up of rugby stars Ben Foden, Thom Evans and Levi Davis.</p>
      <p>The trio are in Simon Cowell's category but he had already given his safe seat to Love Island collective No Love Lost.</p>
      <p>But Nicole was so moved that she threw the rule book out of the window.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After some chanting from the crowd, she made the bold move by getting out of her seat and hitting the golden buzzer for Try Star.</p>
      <p>She then told presenter Dermot O'Leary: "I had to do it for England and I had to do it for the boys."</p>
