一家三口在無人島過30天　小孩考倒探險家爸媽
03 Nov 2019, 08:14 by 翁健偉, 陳仁萱
以《單挑荒野》節目系列打開知名度的求生專家艾德史塔福，帶著老婆蘿拉、2歲的兒子藍恩在印度洋無人小島展開30天的野外生活！這點子聽起來很有趣，但實際做起來超級累人，因為野外求生不難，難的是帶小孩。
《單挑荒野一家人》（Man Woman Child Wild Life）是Discovery頻道全新節目，故名思義由艾德本人包辦所有的攝影，多了也是探險家的老婆蘿拉，加上他們2歲的兒子藍恩，一家三口挑戰印度洋無人島生活30天。本來以為夫妻可以分工合作，一個人負責陪小孩，另外一個就負責張羅求生瑣事，但實際做起來完全不是這樣，因為他們都忽略了2歲小孩有多活潑。


艾德（左）、老婆蘿拉（右），以及他們的2歲兒子藍恩，一起完成無人島過30天的大考驗。

蘿拉說：「小孩才不管你累不累、餓不餓，有很多時候真的很疲累、又沒食物吃，但小孩就來找你，要陪他玩什麼的。你根本就累死了，還要強顏歡笑在那邊娛親，甚至追在他後頭跑，心想『這根本不是我要的生活』！」加上很多育兒道具，例如尿布等，都不能帶到島上，所以很多事情處理起來更讓人頭大，蘿拉笑說好比說小孩便溺，「你如果沒有馬上處理，他又大了，那個顏色就會變更深，一看就知道他大了幾次！我才知道原來小孩大號原來不是一次就解決，而是會分很多次！」假使偷懶不去處理，最後會更難弄，「所以小孩大了就抓去海裡頭沖洗，所以整過程會一直重複『大了』『清洗』『帶回來』，20分鐘後再來一次！」
所以整個無人島的30天生活，對大人來說就變成《小鬼當家》似的考驗。只是換成2歲的小孩藍恩，在不斷出難題給他的探險家爸媽。艾德說：「他完全沒有任何壓力，不擔心拍片、也不用擔心求生技能，他比我們兩個更開心！幾乎24小時都纏著爸爸媽媽，我整個過程都沒有任何一刻放鬆過！他一下子想跳到海裡玩水，一下想爬樹，根本不在乎任何危險！」
但也因為藍恩的活潑好動，對危險一無所知，讓這次冒險也多了些樂趣，蘿拉發現小孩會拿起沙灘上的貝殼，聽裡頭有沒有回音，「當他發現螃蟹的時候，就覺得很有趣，因為螃蟹會裝死，等沒人注意才會動起來。這對小孩來說很新鮮，就是現成的玩具，他會很有耐心跟螃蟹玩。所以看他跟螃蟹玩就是我最開心的事情。」


2歲的藍恩是完全不受控的，光是拍照就自顧自玩起來了，才不管你們大人。

在無人島上，什麼都要靠自己，從建立遮風避雨的休憩處，到張羅三餐，全部都要靠自己處理。在這種情況下，很容易發生爭持。蘿拉說：「我們一直有爭執！」艾德：「因為我說不要拍成像YouTube那種誇張節目。」而且爭執從第一天就開始，蘿拉說：「因為很累、我只想坐著休息，但他還要拍，我想從那時候就會一直爭執，『該生火嗎？』等之類的事情。」只是吵歸吵，也沒有辦法吵到不相往來的地步，因為終究要以小孩優先！艾德說：「這的確跟我以前節目不一樣，以前都是我負責全部拍攝，但這次有了蘿拉，變數就不一樣了。我一直在想『剛剛那個鏡頭有拍到嗎？』」
遠離文明自然需要付出代價，艾德說因為跟社會隔絕，沒有家人、朋友，「只能彼此照顧，雖然是一家人，卻體會到前所未有的孤寂。以前我們會找親戚、朋友幫忙帶小孩，但是這在島上都不可能，這對我們來說是前所未有的體驗。」蘿拉則說自己在島上會想念快煮壺，「因為平日你燒開水大概不用兩分鐘就好了，但在無人島上，你要從生火開始，要很有耐心才能燒好開水，但也不得不適應，因為沒有安全的飲水，什麼都甭玩了。」
在看似玩命的冒險背後，其實他們也做了萬全的準備，像是醫療、後勤都是隨時待命，以防他們出事，艾德說假使沒有這些後勤，也不會答應這次冒險。蘿拉說他們一家的示範是挺極端的，出發前都經過仔細討論，「我非常鼓勵家庭去嘗試露營、戶外生活，但不會鼓勵其他家庭跑去無人島生活。」
在這次大冒險後，他們有打算往後去哪度假呢？艾德說：「以後去迪士尼樂園就好！」蘿拉則說：「我真的很想去峇里島、或泰國的小島，在海灘上躺平，喝雞尾酒，然後把小孩托給保姆照顧。」聽起來不管你有多厲害的身手，碰到小孩，也只能甘拜下風。

A family of three spent 30 days in the uninhabited island.
03 Nov 2019, 08:14 by Weng Jianwei, Chen Renxuan
With the ""single-handed wilderness"" program series, the well-known survival expert Ed Stafford opened his 30-day wild life with his wife Lola and his 2-year-old son, Lan En, in the uninhabited island of the Indian Ocean! This sounds very interesting, but it is really tiring to do it, because it is not difficult to survive in the wild. It is difficult to bring children.
""Man Woman Child Wild Life"" is a new show on Discovery Channel, so the name suggests that all the photography is done by Ed, and the explorer's wife, Lola, plus their 2-year-old son. Lan En, a family of three who challenged the Indian Ocean uninhabited island for 30 days. Originally thought that husband and wife can work together, one person is responsible for accompanying children, the other is responsible for Zhang Luo to survive the trivial things, but the actual implementation is completely different, because they have ignored the lively 2 year old children.


Ed (left), wife Lola (right), and their 2-year-old son, Lan En, completed the 30-day test of the uninhabited island.

Lola said: ""Children don't care if you are tired or hungry. There are many times when you are really tired and have no food to eat, but the child comes to you and wants to play with him. You are exhausted at all. I also want to be happy and laugh at the entertainment, and even chasing him behind him, thinking, ""This is not the life I want!"" Plus many childcare props, such as diapers, can't be brought to the island, so many things It’s even bigger when it’s handled. Lola laughs and says that the child is awkward. “If you don’t deal with it right away, he’s big, the color will change deeply. I know that he’s been a few times at a glance! I only know the original. The child's large size is not solved once, but it will be divided many times!"" If you are lazy and don't handle it, it will be harder to get it. ""So when the child is too big, he will grab the head and rinse it, so the whole process will repeat."" ""Clean"" ""Bring it back"", come back in 20 minutes!""
Therefore, the 30-day life of the entire uninhabited island becomes a test for the ""Little Ghosts"". Just replaced with a 2-year-old child, Lan En, who is constantly giving trouble to his explorer parents. Ed said: ""He has no pressure at all, he is not worried about filming, and he does not have to worry about survival skills. He is more happy than the two of us! I am entangled in my father and mother for almost 24 hours. I have not relaxed any moment in the whole process! I want to jump into the sea to play with water, and I want to climb the tree, I don’t care about any danger!""
But because Lan En's lively and active, no knowledge of the danger, let this adventure have more fun, Lola found that the child will pick up the shell on the beach, listen to the echo inside, ""When he found the crab At that time, it feels very interesting, because the crab will be dead, and no one will pay attention to it. This is very fresh for children, it is a ready-made toy, he will have great patience to play with crabs. So watch him play with crabs. It is my happiest thing.""


The 2-year-old Lan En is completely uncontrolled. Just take photos and take care of yourself.

On the uninhabited island, everything depends on oneself, from the establishment of a shelter from shelter from the rain, to the three meals of Zhang Luo, all of which must be handled by themselves. In this case, it is easy to have a dispute. Lola said: ""We have been arguing all the time!"" Ed: ""Because I said that I don't want to shoot the exaggerated program of YouTube."" And the dispute started from the first day, Lola said: ""Because it is very tired, I just want to sit. Resting, but he still wants to shoot, I think I will always argue from that time, ""Would you like to make a fire?"" and so on."" It’s just a noisy, no way to quarrel with each other, because after all Give priority to children! Ed said: ""This is indeed different from my previous program. I used to take all the shots, but this time with Lola, the variables are different. I have been thinking, ""Is the lens just photographed?""
Away from civilization, it takes a price. Aide said that because he is isolated from society, he has no family or friends. ""You can only take care of each other. Although you are a family, you will feel the loneliness that you have never seen before. We will find relatives and friends to help bring children, but This is impossible on the island, which is an unprecedented experience for us.” Lola said that she would miss the quick-cooking pot on the island. “Because you usually boil water for about two minutes on weekdays, but on the uninhabited island, You have to start from the fire, you have to be patient to burn the water, but you have to adapt, because there is no safe drinking water, everything is played.""
Behind the seemingly life-threatening adventures, they have also prepared everything, such as medical and logistics, to be on call, in case they have an accident, Eide said that if there is no such logistics, they will not promise this adventure. Lola said that the demonstrations of their family were extremely extreme. They were discussed carefully before departure. ""I strongly encourage families to try camping and outdoor life, but they will not encourage other families to run uninhabited islands.""
After this big adventure, what are they going to go on holiday? Ed said: ""It’s good to go to Disneyland in the future!"" Lola said, ""I really want to go to Bali, or the island of Thailand, lie flat on the beach, drink cocktails, and then take the child to the babysitter. ""It doesn't matter how good you are, if you meet a child, you can only go down the drain.""
