      <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - It's that time of year when the sun starts setting sooner and we turn our clocks back to standard time.</p>
      <p>While most people dread having to manually change the clocks on a bunch of appliances — oven, microwave and bedside alarm clock, to name a few — around their homes on Sunday (or Saturday night for the early birds), there's one thing most people won't have to worry about touching at all: their smartphones.</p>
      <p>Most smartphone clocks will automatically adjust, if the phone's software is up to date.</p>
      <p>However, if you went into the settings and changed any of the default settings, you may have to update your clock yourself once daylight saving time ends.</p>
      <p>If you have an iPhone, make sure it has "Set Automatically" enabled under "Date &amp; Time."</p>
      <p>If you have an Android system, make sure your settings prompt the phone to use a network-provided time zone.</p>
      <p>Happy extra-hour-of-sleep day!</p>
