      <p>A drug lord at the helm of a huge cocaine operation was pictured posing with a gun in a brazen snap before his crimes came to light.</p>
      <p>Christopher Jones, 32, has been sentenced to 18-and-a-half years behind bars after admitting 10 drugs and gun offences.</p>
      <p>The criminal, formerly known as Ricky Bates, supplied cocaine and other illegal substances in Staffordshire, and his arrest led to five other men being convicted.</p>
      <p>His crimes included conspiracy to supply cocaine, possession of two firearms and conspiracy to import a gun from Albania - were racked up over a four year period.</p>
      <p>During the police investigation - leading to his eventual conviction and sentencing - detectives worked to piece together evidence from phone records, searches and interviews.</p>
      <p>Officers also discovered several pictures of Jones on holiday, enjoying first class travel around the world, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/drug-lord-ricky-bates-lavish-17189853">Birmingham Live reports</a> .</p>

      <p>Key members of his drugs empire - Ramandeep Singh, described as Jones’s ‘relief manager’ and street dealers Harpreet Johal, Jamie Sinclair, Colin Brown and Alex Wootton  all from Wolverhampton have also been convicted on drugs offences.</p>
      <p>All four were jailed at Stafford Crown Court on September 30.</p>
      <p>Officers seized two firearms while searching Jones's property back in December 2015 -  a sawn off shotgun and  a double-barrelled shotgun, that as stolen during a 2014 burglary at a farm in Cocknage, near Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
      <p>They also found 1.33kg of amphetamine, 22.9kg of benzocaine (a recognised cocaine cutting agent), 8.775 litres of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), and digital scales containing traces of cocaine.</p>

      <p>A 25kg package of benzocaine being shipped to Jones from Hong Kong was also intercepted by the UK Border Force at Coventry Airport.</p>
      <p>In October 2017, Jones was arrested again and police recovered cocaine, bundles of cash and digital scales from his property and car.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant James Byrne, of Staffordshire Police, said: “Christopher Jones will be known to most people in south Staffordshire as Ricky Bates.</p>
      <p>"He ran a drugs supply operation bringing cocaine and a host of other illegal substances to the streets of south Staffordshire and the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>“It is concerning that he was found in possession of two firearms and was involved in a conspiracy to import further ones from Albania.</p>

      <p>"We are glad the result of our detectives’ painstaking work in building this complex case is that Jones and his associates are now behind bars.”</p>
