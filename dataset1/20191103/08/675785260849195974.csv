The first weekend of November comes to an end with two race meetings in the UK.
There's plenty of action at Huntingdon and Carlisle - and our man Newsboy has scoured the form to bring you the best bets and tips.
With some favourites and a few better value bets, as well as a more ambitious daily double, there is plenty to interest the punters.
We've also got the NAP and Next Best bet on offer - as well as a quick glance at the action at the start of next week.
Have a look and see what tickles your interest, but please remember to always gamble responsibly.

DOUBLE: BAFANA BLUE and TWOTWOTHREE
BAFANA BLUE is fancied to win for the fourth time during a fruitful 2019 by beating six rivals for the Cumberland Handicap Chase (3.40) at Carlisle this afternoon. The Maurice Barnes-trained eight-year-old was having his first outing of the winter when scoring over course and distance 10 days ago and Ross Chapman’s mount should once again be competitive despite a 5lb rise in the weights.

MONDAY - JALAAD (3.00 Kempton Park)
TUESDAY - RESTIVE (4.05 Southwell)
WEDNESDAY - SHE'S A UNICORN (1.25 Nottingham)
