        <b>Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy has won the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai after a play-off.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 30-year-old beat defending champion Xander Schauffele after the pair were tied at 19 under par after four rounds.</p>
      <p>Schauffele, 26, sunk a six-foot birdie putt on the last to force the play-off with the four-time major champion.</p>
      <p>In the first play-off hole McIlroy's birdie was enough to secure his fourth title of the year after the American could only make par.</p>
      <p>McIlroy, who went bogey-free over the final two rounds, could only par on the 18th in round four after a poor drive and missed a 25-footer to take an outright victory at Sheshan International.</p>
      <p>"I got lucky in regulation not to go in the water and then it was a relief to hit those two shots in the play-off," McIlroy said of his approach in the play-off, after winning his 26th worldwide title.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was a perfect [yardage] for a four-iron back into the wind a little bit.</p>
      <p>"You've got to take everything else out of the equation and just hit the shot."</p>
      <p>American Schauffele, who would have been the first player to retain the title had he won, started the day two shots back but a final-round six-under 66 brought him level with the world number two.</p>
      <p>However, after being unable to match McIlroy in the play-off he admitted: "When he's on, I'd say he's arguably the best player in the world."</p>
      <p>South African Louis Oosthuizen's fourth round 69 was enough to secure him third place, two shots behind the leaders.</p>
      <p>England's Matthew Fitzpatrick, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/50259758">who led after the second round,</a> had a mixed Sunday which included an eagle, two birdies and three bogeys to finish on 14 under and fifth on the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Victor Perez, Matthias Schwab and Abraham Ancer finished tied for fourth on 15 under.</p>
