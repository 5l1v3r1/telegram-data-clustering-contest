      <p>Washington - PGA Tour rookie <b>Harry Higgs</b> picked up two birdies in his final three holes to open up a two-shot lead after the third round of the Bermuda Championship on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old overnight co-leader from New Jersey's grandstand finish gave him a six-under-par 65 for a 54-hole 17-under-par aggregate at Port Royal Golf Club course in Southampton, Bermuda.</p>
      <p>That left him two clear of Brendon Todd, who shot a four-under-par 67 to finish the day on 15 under, one ahead of Bo Hoag and Brian Gay, tied for third on 14 under.</p>
      <p>Hoag surged up the leaderboard with a flawless seven-under-par 64, the lowest scoring round of the day.</p>
      <p>It was a welcome return to low-scoring for Hoag, who had also carded a 64 in the first round before a frustrating 71 on Friday.</p>
      <p>Hoag had looked poised to stake a claim for the lead after making a blistering start which saw him five under through seven holes.</p>
      <p>But although he bagged two more just after the turn on 10 and 12, he was unable to add to the tally down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Scottie Scheffler, who had finished the second round tied for the lead with Higgs and Todd, fell away from the leading pack after a two-under-par 69. Scheffler is in fifth on 13 under, four off the pace.</p>
      <p>This year marks the introduction of the US tour's first event in Bermuda. It is lacking star power as it is being played opposite the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.</p>
