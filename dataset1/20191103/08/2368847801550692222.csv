走失忠犬原地苦等4年 見到主人卻轉身離去

03 Nov 2019, 08:55

狗狗的忠誠眾所周知。很多有關忠犬的故事，往往讓人心痛的同時也大受感動。今天就來講講泰國一條名叫Leo的土狗。
英文網站 Additycentral 9月16日的一篇文章，就是講述了狗狗Leo的故事。
Leo是當地一隻再普通不過的土狗，當牠被公眾關注之前，牠已經在泰國一條車來車往的馬路邊，守候了足足四年。這4年當中，無論風吹雨打，日晒雨淋，還是被驅趕、被捕捉，牠從未離開過。
起初，並沒有太多的人留意牠，以為牠不過是一條普通的流浪狗。時間長了，當地居民發現，無論怎樣驅趕，牠都不肯離開，而是痴痴地望著來往的車，似乎在等待著什麼。
後來，這條可憐的狗狗因為營養不良而顯得奄奄一息，身上的皮毛也因為感染了皮膚病脫離嚴重，虛弱的身體連站著都顫顫巍巍，喘著粗氣……
這時，牠遇到了Saowalak，一名泰國婦女。
附近的村民告訴Saowalak，牠是只沒人要的流浪狗，不知道為什麼總是固執地守在這兒，趕走了上百次，又回來了上百次。
此情此景，讓她無法視而不見。她小心翼翼地把牠帶回家，還幫牠取了一個新名字：Leo。
在她的精心呵護下，Leo恢復很快。
本以為Leo從此在新家安定下來。沒想到，四天後，當Saowalak回到家中，尋遍屋裡屋外也沒有看到牠。
Saowalak當時想，難道牠寧願流浪也不想有個家？
她匆匆忙忙跑去當初抱回Leo 的那個路口。果然，看見Leo又站在那個路口，眼睛直直地盯著一輛輛來來往往的車，眼睛燃起希望又再次熄滅，一直重複。
那一刻，她突然明白到，Leo或許不是流浪狗，牠可能是一隻走失的狗，牠只能選擇在原地等著主人回來找牠。
這一次，她沒有靠近，只是站在不遠處靜靜地觀察牠。而Leo似乎也聞到了這位恩人的氣味，回過頭看著Saowalak，好像在說，謝謝你，可我不能跟你走……我一走，他們就找不到我了。
Saowalak一陣心酸。
於是，她再也不強迫牠跟她回家了，只是每天把飯菜送到Leo等待的路邊，輕輕地安慰撫摸牠。實在忙不過的時候，也會交待家人把食物送過來。
有時，附近的村民也會來看看，有的還直接跟Leo說，「你已經被拋棄了，不要再等了，等也是白等。」儘管知道狗狗未必聽得懂這番話。
Leo還是靜靜地在等著，牠一等就是四年。而Saowalak一陪也是四年。也許在牠灰色的世界裡，她是牠唯一的溫暖。
漸漸地，Leo的故事在網上傳開，很快，Leo的照片被分享了千萬次。牠的前主人也因此在社交媒體重新看到了Leo的身影。
原來，Leo並不是被拋棄的。 牠原來的名字叫BonBon，一次，牠和主人乘車去拜訪親戚時，這小傢伙不知道何時跳下了車。等他們發現時，小傢伙早已沒有蹤影。
他們沿途找了一路，隨後又找了一星期，可始終不見任何消息。他們想過很多種可能，就唯獨沒想到牠還在原地等著自己。
當得知BonBon的消息後，一家人趕緊趕去那個路口，狗狗苦等了4年，終於聞到了心心唸唸的主人氣味。還沒等車停下來，牠便瘋狂地跑過去。
對這一家人而言，再次看到BonBon，無異於見到死而復生的家人。那一刻，他們切實地感受了，失而復得的激動與美好。
也許，你以為到此，故事就大團圓結局了。可接下的一幕，卻讓所有人都難以置信。
就在前主人要把BonBon帶上車回家時，時間彷彿瞬間停止了。牠一動不動地看著不遠處的Saowalak，曾經期待地望著自己的眼睛，這次，狗狗的目光只聚焦在她一人身上。
Saowalak再也忍不住了，蹲下來張開雙臂，而狗狗沒有絲毫猶豫地朝她跑去。
狗狗似乎明白，當初如果不是Saowalak，自己或許早已橫屍路邊，是她給了自己第二次生命。而牠在路邊漫長的等待，似乎只是怕主人回來找不到牠而傷心。如今，終於看到自己的主人了。然而，另一個人對自己也恩重如山……Leo也不忍離她而去……
讓人暖心的是，前主人尊重Leo的意願，讓Leo去陪伴給了牠新生的新主人，而他們也會定期去Saowalak看望牠，並帶給牠所需的一切。
四年，對我們而言也不算短了，對於狗來說，就更相當於人生的27年。雖然期間經歷無數風吹雨打、也經歷過升起希望後又失望的失落……如今，狗狗終於換來溫暖的結局。
願世間所有人、所有物都能被溫柔以對！

The lost loyal dog waited for 4 years in the same place. When he saw the owner, he turned and left.

03 Nov 2019, 08:55

Dog loyalty is well known. Many stories about loyal dogs are often heartbreaking and deeply touched. Today, I will talk about a Thai dog named Leo.
English website Additycentral An article on September 16th tells the story of dog Leo.
Leo is a local, uncommon dog. Before it was noticed by the public, it was already on the roadside of a car in Thailand, waiting for four years. During these four years, no matter whether it was raining or raining, sun and rain, it was driven and captured. It never left.
At first, not many people noticed it, thinking that it was just an ordinary stray dog. After a long time, the local residents found that no matter how they drove, it refused to leave, but looked at the car with obsessiveness and seemed to be waiting for something.
Later, this poor dog was dying because of malnutrition, and the fur on his body was severely tainted because of the infection of the skin. The weak body stood still trembled and gasped...
At this time, it met Saowalak, a Thai woman.
The nearby villagers told Saowalak that it was a stray dog that no one wanted. I don’t know why I always stayed here stubbornly, drove away hundreds of times, and returned hundreds of times.
This situation makes her unable to turn a blind eye. She took it home with care and gave it a new name: Leo.
Under her care, Leo recovered quickly.
I thought that Leo has settled down in his new home. Unexpectedly, four days later, when Saowalak returned home, he did not see it outside the house.
Saowalak thought at the time, wouldn't he prefer to wander and don't want to have a home?
She hurried to the intersection where she was holding back to Leo. Sure enough, I saw Leo standing at the intersection again, staring straight at a car coming and going, his eyes burning and hopes to go out again, repeating.
At that moment, she suddenly realized that Leo might not be a stray dog. It might be a lost dog. It can only choose to wait for the owner to come back to find it.
This time, she didn't get close, just standing still and watching it quietly. And Leo seems to smell the smell of this benefactor. Looking back at Saowalak, it seems to be saying, thank you, but I can't go with you... I can't find me when I leave.
Saowalak was so sad.
So, she never forced her to go home with her, but just sent the food to the roadside waiting for Leo every day, gently comforting and stroking it. When it’s too busy, I will also tell my family to send the food.
Sometimes, the nearby villagers will come to see it, and some will directly tell Leo, ""You have been abandoned, don't wait any longer, wait for it, etc."" Even though you know that dogs may not understand this.
Leo is still waiting quietly, it is four years. Saowalak is also accompanied by four years. Perhaps in its grey world, she is the only warmth.
Gradually, Leo's story spread on the Internet, and soon Leo's photos were shared thousands of times. Its former owner has thus re-visited Leo on social media.
It turned out that Leo was not abandoned. Its original name was BonBon, once, and when it was with the owner to visit relatives by car, the little guy didn't know when to jump off the car. When they found out, the little guy had already disappeared.
They found a way along the way, and then searched for another week, but they never saw anything. They thought about a lot of possibilities, but they didn't expect it to be waiting for themselves.
When I heard about BonBon's news, the family rushed to the intersection, and the dog waited for 4 years, and finally smelled the owner's smell. Before he stopped waiting for the car, it ran wildly.
For this family, seeing BonBon again is tantamount to seeing a family who is born again. At that moment, they actually felt the excitement and beauty of the lost.
Maybe, you think that at this point, the story will be a happy ending. The scene that can be taken is unbelievable to everyone.
Just when the former owner wanted to bring BonBon home, the time seemed to stop instantly. It looked at Saowalak not far away, and looked at his eyes with anticipation. This time, the dog's gaze focused on her alone.
Saowalak couldn't help it anymore, kneeling down and spreading his arms, and the dog didn't hesitate to run towards her.
The dog seems to understand that if it wasn't for Saowalak, she might have been on the side of the road, she gave her a second life. And it waited long on the side of the road, it seems that it is just sad that the owner can't find it. Now, I finally see my master. However, another person is also very kind to himself... Leo can't bear to leave her...
It is warmhearted that the former owner respects Leo's wishes and let Leo accompany him to his new owner, who will also visit Saowalak regularly to see it and bring everything he needs.
For four years, it is not too short for us. For dogs, it is more than 27 years of life. Although I experienced countless winds and rains during the period, I also experienced the loss of hope after the rise of hope... Now, the dog finally got a warm ending.
May all people and things in the world be gentle and right!
