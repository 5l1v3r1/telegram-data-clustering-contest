Some welcome news for Brits on benefits this morning, as the Government confirms it will finally end the four-year benefit freeze. That means a 1.7% hike to benefits for Brits on Universal Credit and other state benefits. George Osborne froze is back in 2016, and said it would only <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10268868/boris-johnson-will-end-benefits-freeze-next-year-with-1-7-hike-for-10million-brits/">last four years, but this is finally confirmation that it will end.</a></li>

The Brexit Party leader hit out at the Prime Minister after reports emerged indicating the Conservative Party manifesto would jettison the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. The policy would represent a step back from Mr Johnson’s previous “do or die” promises to leave the bloc with or without a deal. Mr Farage wrote on Twitter: “If Boris Johnson will abandon a clean break Brexit, and he wins an election on this, we will never be free of EU rules.” Other policies that are said to be in the party’s manifesto have also emerged, including a number of tax cuts and a firm commitment to law and order. Ann Widdecombe branded the Prime Minister a “silly man” for rejecting Farage’s offer of a Leave Alliance pact between the Brexit Party and the Conservatives. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also took a pop at Donald Trump over his comments questioning his ability to lead the country. He said at a rally in Swindon: “The reality of no-deal is (heading) straight into the arms of Donald Trump. Straight into the arms of a free trade deal with the USA… and their desire to take over our public services. ” We will not go down that path under any circumstances. Our public services, our national health service is not for sale, to Donald Trump or anybody else.” A 23-year-old student, who was given the name ‘Lucy’ took to Twitter to boast she intended to vote twice in the General Election and urged other students to do the same. She wrote on the social media site: “I have just re-registered for both my hometown AND UNI address… in under 120 seconds! If you live at a second address… ADD it to the register and you can vote TWICE. Register twice. Be brave.” However the controversy arises not with her registering twice but with her encouragement of voting twice, which would be an illegal act. And Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson accused Johnson and Corbyn of running scared by not debating her live on ITV.</li>

The ORB International Survey for the Sunday telegraph puts the Tories on 36 per cent – with Labour on 28. Johnson will likely need to substantially increase his lead to guarantee a majority when Britain goes to the polls.</li>

He tweeted: “As the weeks go by and people discover what’s in this deal, they won’t like what they see.”</li>

Ms Swinson unleashed her anger on Twitter posting a link to her party's site which bared the phrase “Debate Her”. She posted the link with the caption: “Scared boys?” On the Lib Dem's website, the party adds: “Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are running scared of debating the woman leader of the strongest party of Remain. “If Jo is not included, it will be the first debate that will just include the leaders of Britain’s two biggest parties. “The voters of this country deserve to hear from Jo Swinson on the debate stage, not just from two men who want to deliver Brexit.”</li>
