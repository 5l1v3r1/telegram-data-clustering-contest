      <h3>The upcoming Activa 6G or the CB-Shine 125 will be Honda’s second BS6 compliant product in India after the recently introduced Activa 125</h3>
      <p>Honda has recently sent media invites for a product launch event 14th November 2019. However, the Japanese two-wheeler manufacturer has been tight-lipped on what exactly they are planning to launch on that particular day. Rumours say that Honda could either launch the much-awaited Activa 6G BS6 110 cc scooter or the new CB-Shine BS6 125.</p>
      <p>If Honda decides to launch the BS-VI compliant Activa 6G in November, expect it to sport a new connectivity feature. The 110cc scooter will likely get turn-by-turn navigation and call alert features like its recently updated rival the TVS Jupiter Grande Edition.</p>
      <p>The upcoming scooter will also receive an external fuel filler cap, 12-inch alloy wheels and a front disc brake as an option (besides the standard drum brake on offer). The scooter will also feature a redesigned LED headlamp and front apron integrated LED turn signals. It will likely also get a redesigned seat and taillamp as well.</p>

      <p>Apart from these minor cosmetic updates, the Activa 6G will also be equipped with a telescopic suspension setup at the front that will replace the dated trailing link front suspension unit which has been a part of the scooter since its inception. Besides the new front suspension setup expect the scooter to also be fitted with an adjustable spring-loaded hydraulic setup at the rear. The upcoming scooter will likely also receive an updated chassis that will help improve the overall handling.</p>
      <p>The Activa 6G will be powered by an updated BS-VI compliant 110cc, single-cylinder motor. To meet the stricter emission norms Honda could equip the engine with a fuel injection system that will replace the carburettor unit. There are no details of the performance numbers available at this moment, the current generation Activa 5G delivers about 8 bhp of peak power and at 7,500 rpm and 9 Nm of peak torque at 5,500 rpm.</p>
      <p>As far as the prices are concerned, expect the upcoming Activa 6G to be priced at least Rs 5-10 thousand over the outgoing model. Honda has recently also launched the updated Activa 125 as well with new features an updated BS-VI complaint fuel-injected engine priced at Rs 67,490 (ex-showroom).</p>

      <p>Besides the new Activa 6G, Honda could likely launch the new CB-Shine 125 SP BS6 as well. The RTO documents of the motorcycle were also surfaced online recently. The document that was recently leaked online reveals that the CB-Shine SP gained 0.58 Ps of peak power compared to the outgoing BS4 model. The BS-VI compliant CB-Shine will thus produce about 10.88 ps of peak power.</p>
      <p>There are no details of the powertrain provided in the leaked document, however, expect the upcoming motorcycle to use the same 124.7cc,single-cylinder, air-cooled, 4 stroke, SI engine. However, Honda will use fuel injection instead of a carburetor to meet the stricter emission norms.</p>
      <p>Besides the updated engine, the leaked documents also reveal that the upcoming CB-Shine SP 125 is also comparatively longer, wider and taller than the outgoing model. The upcoming motorcycle also has a slightly longer wheelbase of 1285mm compared to the outgoing model.</p>
      <p>All these new dimension figures suggest that the CB-Shine SP 125 will feature a completely new design. Expect the upcoming CB-Shine SP 125 to be available in three variants. However, the top-spec variant of the CB-Shine 125 will only feature a front disc brake while the other two variants will get a drum brake as standard.</p>
      <p>As far as the pricing is concerned, the upcoming CB-Shine SP 125 will likely be priced atleast Rs 7-10 thousand more than the outgoing model. We will update you with more details as soon as Honda launched their new products on 14th November 2019.</p>
