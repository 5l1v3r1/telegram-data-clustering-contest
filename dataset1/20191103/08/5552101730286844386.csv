距離星宇航空首航剩下不到3個月，上週張國煒親自將飛機開回，塔臺一句「Welcome Home」逼出不少人的眼淚，他為了圓航空夢一路走來經歷許多困難與挑戰，昨(2日)官方粉絲團放出一段「A321neo」的縮時組裝過程，寫下「航空業從來不是容易入門的領域，但星宇航空，敢作夢才能圓夢! 」再次見證K董的決心與魄力！
星宇航空上週由張國煒親自開回首架「A321neo」客機，引發粉絲高度關注，昨日也在FB粉絲專頁曝光123秒的組裝過程實錄，發布短短一天就累積37萬人次觀看，星宇指出，航空製造業的祕辛不是一部短短123秒影片就能講述完畢，許多細節在鏡頭前只是一秒掃過，又或甚至只是一片背景，卻是無數航空人才的心血，影片的背後有辛酸、有汗水、有酸語、有醋語，但現在，都幻化成星宇人共享的甜美成果。
有粉絲開心表示，飛機製造過程的影片相當難得一見，星宇願意大方分享真的太令人高興，其他網友也紛紛附和「看了很感動，從無到完成，佩服K董，K董及星宇加油」、「如果不是星宇、還真的沒注意到一架飛機甚至是航空公司的誕生背後，是需要經過多少的努力和時間！」、「台灣航空業沒有一位老闆會親自監督一切，甚至自己開飛機回台灣，會這麼做就知道有多在乎乘客的安全，相信星宇以後會是台灣航空業的驕傲」。
官方粉絲團小編除了回文答謝粉絲熱情外，也預告12月將迎接第二架A321neo 抵台，讓粉絲更加期待開航日的到來！
