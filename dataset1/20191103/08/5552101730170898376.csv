03 Nov 2019, 08:58 by 溫雅雯
日本影壇奇才山田孝之因Netflix網劇《AV帝王》再創演藝高峰，近期忙於拍攝第二季的他，得知台灣也要上映他的紀錄片《山田孝之的痛苦與榮耀》，立馬二話不說趁工作空檔錄製催票影片，希望台灣觀眾能到戲院觀賞歷時5年拍攝的紀錄片。
山田孝之的「多變身材」常被粉絲討論，原來他認為這個角色的身材應該是如何？他就會決定當下要變胖還是要精練身體，例如《勇者義彥》系列是冒險劇，山田孝之說：「剛開始先順其自然，拍攝過程中再慢慢增肌，讓身體隨著勇者的冒險變得強壯。」因為是連續劇，所以讓觀眾也可以透過他的身材變化，感受到冒險帶來的轉變，皮膚慢慢變黑、體格變魁武…等，對於角色準備的投入既敬業、山田孝之有他自己獨特的見解。
而山田孝之和菅田將暉在電視劇《勇者義彥與被引導的七人》曾經合作過，2018年又共同主演《dele刪除人生》，劇中兩人共同執行委託人任務，對手戲超多拍出好交情，也曾在記者會活動上互誇對方「很可愛！」事實上，山田孝之是抱著「羨慕」的眼光在看菅田將暉多變的演員形象；山田孝之表示：「我20多歲的時候，好不容易找到的方向，菅田將暉卻一直進展的很順利，他不在乎個人形象，不斷挑戰新的角色，我真的覺得他是很努力的人，真的很棒。」而如今雖然已經36歲了，他依然在這條路上堅持著，2019年終於以網劇《AV帝王》西村透一角聲勢更加高漲。

紀錄片《山田孝之的痛苦與榮耀》從山田孝之30歲時開始，花費5年共2,045天的時間跟拍，從他第一次挑戰舞台劇《Full Monty》，大膽全裸僅著丁字褲屁股蛋全見的超經典畫面，更是有在拍攝電影《黑金丑島君》系列及電視劇《勇者義彥和被引導的七人》、《dele刪除人生》、網劇《AV帝王》…等的片場花絮大公開。電影即將於11月8日在台上映，電影預售票現正於博客來售票網（http://bit.ly/2MGN802）熱賣中，更多訊息請至水元素文創粉絲團查詢。

2045 days full shooting with Yamada Takayuki documentary generous ass
03 Nov 2019, 08:58 by Wen Yawen
Japanese film genius singer Yamada Takayuki has re-created the peak of the performance of the Netflix online drama ""AV Emperor"". He was busy shooting the second season recently and learned that Taiwan will also release his documentary ""The Pain and Glory of Yamada Takayuki"".趁Working space to record the reminder film, I hope that the Taiwanese audience can go to the theater to watch the documentary that lasted for 5 years.
Yamada Takayuki's ""variable body"" is often discussed by fans. What did he think of the character's figure? He will decide whether to become fat or to refine the body at the moment. For example, the ""Yong Yan Yi Yan"" series is an adventure drama. Yamada Takashi said: ""Before you first let go of nature, slowly increase your muscles during the shooting process, let the body follow the brave. The adventure has become strong."" Because it is a series, so that the audience can also change through his body, feel the transformation brought by the adventure, the skin slowly turns black, the body becomes arrogant...etc. Yamada Takayuki has his own unique insights.
Yamada Takayuki and Sumida Huihui have cooperated in the TV series ""The Brave Man and the Seven Persons Guided"". In 2018, they co-starred in ""Dele Deleting Life"". In the play, the two perform the principal task together, and the opponents play more than one. Good friendship, but also praised each other at the press conference. ""It’s very cute!"" In fact, Yamada Takashi is holding the image of ""envy"" to see the image of the actor who will change in Putian; Yamada Takashi said: ""I am more than 20 When I was old, I couldn’t find the direction. Putian Huihui has been progressing smoothly. He doesn’t care about his personal image and constantly challenges new roles. I really think he is a very hard worker. It’s really great.” Nowadays Although he is 36 years old, he still insists on this road. In 2019, he finally got a higher momentum in the online drama ""AV Emperor"".


Yamada Takayuki envied the path of the actor of Putian Huihui, thinking that he was much luckier than himself. (provided by water element)

The documentary ""The Pain and Glory of Yamada Takayuki"" began with Yamada Takashi at the age of 30 and spent 5 years with a total of 2,045 days of filming. From his first challenge to the stage drama ""Full Monty"", he was bold and naked with only thongs and ass. Super classic pictures, there are also a series of filming ""Black Gold ugly island"" series and TV series ""Brave Yan Yi and the seven people being guided"", ""Dele delete life"", the online drama ""AV Emperor""... . The film will be released on the stage on November 8th. The movie pre-sale ticket is now on the blog to sell the ticket network (http://bit.ly/2MGN802).
