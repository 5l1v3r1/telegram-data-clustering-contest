      <h1>Meesha Shafi stands up for Rabi Pirzada</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T08:40:52+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>In a recent turn of events, Rabi Pirzada’s videos were compromised and hashtag #RabiPirzada was trending on social media with Twitterati heavily criticising the breach of privacy.</p>
      <p>“The vile campaign against Rabi Pirzada is a stark reminder of how privacy is violated to blackmail women into submission. Morality is used to justify such abhorrent campaigns whereas people leaking such footage hide behind societal norms. They should be behind bars,” stated the international public policy and gender reforms specialist Salman Sufi.</p>

      <p>However, the issue really took a deep dive into the past when popular singer Meesha Shafi came out in support of fellow vocalist, adding an old statement of hers to the claim.</p>
      <p>Tweeting in the favour of Pirzada, however, Shafi reiterated how she had ‘accused her of a publicity stunt’ when she came out with her accusations against Ali Zafar. Regardless of which, the star added that she would always raise her voice when a victim is “shamed and humiliated”.</p>
      <p>“The same women who were accused of speaking up as a publicity stunt by Rabi are defending her unconditionally today. Including myself,” her tweet claimed. “I highly condemn the leaking and sharing of these private videos and will always raise my voice when a victim is being shamed and humiliated,” she added.</p>
      <p>On a different spectrum, however, Pirzada’s tweet from last year boasted how she had “never been disrespected by men” and that she had “no story to share for publicity.”</p>
      <p>However, Shafi resorted to defending the victim, following which her lawyer and Human rights activist, Nighat Dad, also condemned the leaking of  videos, claiming that according to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act, spreading “non-consensual intimate images and videos” to others is a crime.</p>

      <p>“Those who are weaponizing non-consensual intimate images and videos of Rabi Pirzada and those who are forwarding them are committing crime under PECA. Don’t be a silent bystander, report these tweets and do not forward this violence,” she urged fellow users.</p>
