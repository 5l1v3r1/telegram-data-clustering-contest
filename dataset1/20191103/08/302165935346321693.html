      <p>KOTA BARU, Nov 3 — The Kelantan Social Security Organisation (Socso) today assisted eight former personnel of the newspaper, Sinar Harian through the Employment Insurance System (SIP).</p>
      <p>Its director Nora Yaakob said SIP, which was launched on January 1 last year, was aimed at easing the burden borne by workers who had lost their jobs including due to company downsizing, bankrupt employers and others.</p>
      <p>‘’We do not want the contributors to be stressed when their employments are terminated because many of them will be at a loss. So, the availability of this insurance scheme can motivate them,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>She said this at a media conference after being present to deliver the benefits of SIP to the former personnel of Sinar harian at Rumah Wartawan in Taman Sari here today.</p>
      <p>Also present were the state Socso SIP Branch Zone chief Muhammad Syahir Ammar Mohamed and Kelantan Darul Naim Media Club (Kemudi) president Azran Fitri Ab Rahim.</p>
      <p>At the same time, a briefing was also held and 15 Kelantan Utusan staff also submitted their application forms for SIP.</p>
      <p>Other than financial aid through SIP, Nora said it also had a worker job replacement programme which covered career counselling, job search, job matching, job placement and also training. — Bernama</p>
