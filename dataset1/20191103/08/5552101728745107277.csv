香港區議員選舉即將到來（11月24日），昨（2日）有民主派候選人根據《選舉條例》第12（5）條，能合法舉行集會，在維多利亞公園舉行集會，卻遭到港警指為非法集會，施放催淚彈並進行驅散，要求提早結束，示威者遭到鎮壓感到不滿至中共官媒《新華社》香港分社砸破玻璃並縱火焚燒，今天包含《央視》《環球時報》《人民日報》等中國官媒紛紛發文譴責，表示這是「對中央和內地的挑釁」。
香港反送中活動進入第5個月，每週都仍有民眾自發舉行集會表達訴求，昨（2日）有民眾分別在中環遮打花園、愛丁堡廣場申請集會，獲得警方發出不反對通知書，也有民主派區議員參選人為了月底（11月24日）即將到來的選舉，根據《選舉條例》第12（5）條，在維多利亞公園舉行合法集會，沒想到理由卻不被港警接受，發出反對通知書，防暴警察到場對市民進行圍捕，除了要求市民蹲下、面壁和高舉雙手，防暴警察也施放催淚彈，並以水砲車潮人群進行驅散。
遭到驅離的示威者們跑到灣仔中共官媒《新華社》的亞太總分社辦公大樓，除了在外牆噴漆，也有大片玻璃遭到砸壞，現場一片狼藉，大堂有縱火過的痕跡。
中共官媒今日紛紛發文譴責示威者，《環球日報》刊出社論批評這是「對中央和內地的挑釁」「對香港法治的又一次踐踏」「香港不能再亂下去」，央視則指稱「無法無天的亂港暴徒」，《人民日報》批評「對新聞機搆的暴力犯罪行為，是世界上任何一個國家都不會容忍」。
