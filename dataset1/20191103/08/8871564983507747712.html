      <h1>UN chief urges Myanmar to ensure ‘safe’ return of Rohingya</h1>

      <p>The UN chief on Sunday urged Myanmar to ensure the “safe” return of Rohingya refugees driven out by army operations, a plea made in front of Aung San Suu Kyi more than two years since her country cracked down on the Muslim minority.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Bangkok — with Myanmar’s de facto head Suu Kyi in the room — Antonio Guterres said he remains “deeply concerned” about the plight of the Rohingya.</p>
      <p>Violence in Rakhine state in 2017 forced more than 740,000 Rohingya to flee, most seeking refuge in overcrowded camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, in what UN investigators say amounted to genocide.</p>
      <p>Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as citizens.</p>
      <p>The country says it welcomes back those who agree to a bureaucratic status below full citizenship, and if they agree to live under tight guard after their villages were incinerated.</p>
      <p>Guterres said Myanmar is responsible to “ensure a conducive environment for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable repatriation of refugees”.</p>
      <p>Suu Kyi sat in the room expressionless as Guterres spoke.</p>
      <p>Only a few hundred Rohingya have returned to Myanmar so far, with many fearing further persecution in the Buddhist-majority country.</p>
      <p>The secretary-general also called on Myanmar “to ensure humanitarian actors have full and unfettered access to areas of return”.</p>
      <p>Despite repeated entreaties by the UN and endless criticism by rights groups and world leaders, Myanmar has refused to bend in its approach to the Rohingya.</p>
      <p>Much of Rakhine remains largely closed to aid workers and journalists, who can only visit on tightly controlled, military-chaperoned trips.</p>
      <p>It has launched an extensive and increasingly bloody campaign against Rakhine Buddhists, who are also fighting the central state for greater autonomy.</p>
      <p>Suu Kyi has come under fire for failing to use her moral force to defend Rohingya after the 2017 unrest.</p>
      <p>The treatment of the minority has shredded her image as an upholder of human rights in the eyes of the Western world.</p>
      <p>Myanmar’s army has come under fire for covering up the crackdown, which it blamed on Rohingya “terrorists”.</p>
      <p>A leaked ASEAN report earlier this year said the repatriation effort could take a further two years.</p>
      <p>Suu Kyi has faced pressure over her country’s treatment of the Rohingya from fellow ASEAN members Malaysia and Indonesia, which are both Muslim-majority.</p>
