      <p>SEPANG: Spain's Maverick Vinales stormed to a dominant victory in the Malaysian MotoGP Sunday as world champion Marc Marquez fought his way from near the back of the starting grid to finish second.</p>
      <p>Ducati rider <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andrea-Dovizioso">Andrea Dovizioso</a> came in third but there was disappointment for French rookie <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fabio-Quartararo">Fabio Quartararo</a>, who only managed a lacklustre seventh-place after starting from pole.</p>
      <p>Vinales dominated at the Sepang circuit from the outset, quickly breaking through the pack and taking the lead from the early stages after starting second on the grid.</p>
      <p>The Monster Energy Yamaha rider steadily extended his lead over the rest of the pack and never looked threatened.</p>
      <p>Vinales had a lead of about two seconds over Marquez by lap 12 of the 20-lap race, and he finished over three seconds in front.</p>
      <p>It was a major boost for Vinales following last week's Australian MotoGP last week, where he crashed out after leading for much of the race.</p>
      <p>Marquez, crowned world champion for the sixth time last month, had started in 11th place after a terrifying crash in qualifying which saw him thrown from his bike.</p>
      <p>But the Repsol Honda rider surged into second place after just a few laps and stayed there until the end of the race.</p>
