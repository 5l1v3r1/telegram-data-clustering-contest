03 Nov 2019, 08:59 by Tom Mason

Kimi Raikkonen reflected that a mistake cost him his place in P2. The fin qualified in 17th following a positive final practice session which saw him finish in 8th. He was frustrated with how qualifying ended up following a strong P2.

His teammate Antonio Giovinazzi didn't fare much better in qualifying, finishing just once place higher than Raikkonen.



""It’s a pity to be out in Q1 after a good morning session, "" Raikkonen told Alfa Romeo after qualifying.
""I made a mistake braking into turn 12, locked a wheel and that cost me at least three tenths, which would have placed me four or five places higher and into Q2. That was pretty much it after that.""



There is plenty left to race for at the end of the season for the one-time world champion, with him in 14th place, just seven behind Daniel Ricciardo in tenth.
