      <h1>Bernie Sanders talks health care at NAACP forum in Iowa -- but was asked about child care</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T08:55:25+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>Democratic <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential</a> contender Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, I-Vt., appeared to misunderstand a question about access to child care at an NAACP forum in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/iowa">Iowa</a> on Saturday, launching into an answer about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care">health care</a> instead -- for more than two minutes.</p>
      <p>“Senator, the average cost of child care in Iowa is $8,200 a year,” Des Moines NAACP President and moderator Kameron Middlebrooks said, according to a report. “How would you both increase the availability of high-quality care, why at the same time reducing the costs so providers could still have a livable wage?”</p>

      <p>“The health care industry has done a good job of lying to the American people,” Sanders began.</p>
      <p>He continued to speak at length about the high costs of drugs and insurance, never mentioning child care.</p>
      <p>“We can, in fact, substantially lower the cost of health care for the average American and that’s what I intend to do," he concluded, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/painful-bernie-sanders-mistakenly-answers-the-wrong-question-for-2-and-a-half-minutes-at-naacp-forum/">according to Mediaite.com</a>.</p>
