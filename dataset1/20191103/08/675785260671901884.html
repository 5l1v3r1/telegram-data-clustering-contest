      <h1>Seven creepy 'public service films' that nearly scarred British children for life</h1>
      <h2>Whether it's Charlie the Cat, Tufty the Squirrel, or a killer fridge, these British public information films will scare you straight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T08:07:55+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 08:07</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Dodd, https://www.facebook.com/JournoDodd/</a></address>
      <p>Safety warnings for children also walk a fine line - serious enough to get the message across without being so troubling that your little one is traumatised.</p>
      <p>Kids of the 90s may well remember the polite but stern 'Not the child- The sparkler' ads, maybe even the cute 'King of the Road' Safety Hedgehogs'.</p>
      <p>But for the generation before that, the video arm of the now defunct 'Central Office of Information' clearly had an 'anything goes policy' when it came to public safety videos.</p>
      <p>From the grim reaper delighting in a child drowning, to a cat intervening in a child abduction case, these are the nightmarish cautionary tales that a generation were raised on.</p>
      <h3>1. Don't Start November 6th Like This (1970s-1980s)</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>This film featured a young girl screaming and was part of a Take Care With Fireworks campaign</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For a generation that wore that much nylon anything flammable was a risk, but to say the ads where on the terrifying side was an understatement.</p>
      <p>The ad showed a little girl who had decided to handle a sparkler, not knowing they could remain hot long after they'd burnt out.</p>
      <p>As you might imagine the caption 'Don't start November 6th like this' followed by a bandaged child,  was enough to scare most children away from sparklers for life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>2. Don't Fool Around With Fireworks And 'Eyes' ad (1970s)</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>One ad showed a firework exploding in a girls face</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The stepped up versions of these adverts, aimed at older children, included a firework exploding in a child's face after being thrown at her.</p>
      <p>But one ad in particular that scared us witless was shot entirely from behind the child, later revealing he had been blinded by a firework that also "exploded in his face".</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But despite their seemingly over the top message, fireworks when handled improperly are a real danger. Stay safe out there.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>3.) Lonely Water (1973)</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The safety film 'Lonely Water' has become a cult classic (Image: COI 1973)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The film aimed at seven to ten-year-olds was commissioned by the COI in response to the high number of child drowning cases in the UK during the 1970s.</p>
      <p>The sombre film involved a creepy voice over from none other than 'The spirit of lonely water' who looked an awful lot like, well, the grim reaper.</p>
      <p>The commentary opens with "I am the spirit of dark and lonely water: ready to trap the unwary, the showoff, the fool..." and to a shot of the grim reaper in the reeds (Comforting).</p>
      <p>The film shows bunch of children playing on a construction site (casual 1970s child activity) before a child is sucked into a watery vortex trying to retrieve his football.</p>
      <p>The voice then says "the show offs are easy, but the unwary ones are easier still" as another child is dragged to a watery grave.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The 'Spirit of Lonely Water' gave most children a fear of ever swimming again (Image: COI, 1973)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>Cut to a shot of the danger no swimming sign, with the voice saying "Only a fool would ignore this. But there's one born every minute."</p>
      <p>Lastly the camera pans through a rusty, dysentery ridden embankment, where a bunch of children pull a boy out of the water.</p>
      <p>The spirit of lonely water says "sensible children, I have no power over them" before dissolving and maniacally cackling "I'll be back" as the children throw his shawl into the water.</p>
      <p>But as most of the children who watched it at the time will tell you what the film actually did was deter most children from swimming ever again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>4. Charlie Says, Strangers (1970s -1980s)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751148.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-15_57_42.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Charlie Says tackled the troubling issue of child abduction (Image: COI, 1970)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Charlie Says" was a series of six short animated films about a boy called Tony and his cat Charlie aimed at children.</p>
      <p>Charlie, a cat with a voice that grated worse than your tape getting stuck recording Top 40, used to warn Tony (who would translate his garblings) against everything from matches to scalding hot kettles.</p>
      <p>But one episode that continues to haunt the memories of  British children everywhere was about never going off with strangers.</p>
      <p>The film starts with Tony saying "Charlie and I were in the park. Then this man came up and said would I like to see some puppies?</p>
      <p>"And I said Yes. And I was going to go but Charlie stopped me.</p>
      <p>It finishes with Tony saying "Charlie's reminded me I shouldn't go off with people I don't know. Then the man went away. We went and told mummy and she said we'd been very good."</p>
      <p>The film provides a haunting window to the past, to a decade living in the wake of the Moors' murders, a time where many people mistakenly believed only strangers hurt children.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>5. Old Fridges Can Kill, 1971</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-16_04_49.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The service film 'Old Fridges Can Kill' lead to huge changes in the manufacture of modern designs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It must be quite comforting to know you survived a generation where even fridges could kill you.</p>
      <p>This was a genuine public information film, illustrating the dangers of discarded 'lock' friges.</p>
      <p>And in fairness they were very dangerous, if a child got locked inside they could suffocate, because as the advert points out, fridges were impossible to open from the inside.</p>
      <p>The advert opened with the line, "to her it's a caravan, a ship, a castle, even a bed".</p>
      <p>The wonder of magnetic locks has somewhat diminished this threat but the creepy film still remains.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>6. Play Safe, 1978</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751561.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-16_42_29.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Play Safe was one of the most sinister public information films around</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Play Safe consisted of three films, highlighting the dangers of playing near electrical equipment such as overhead lines, electrical substations and pylons.</p>
      <p>Each film was part of a longer film to be shown in schools, and as you might expect some dramatic license was used to scare children straight.</p>
      <p>It was commissioned by the Electricity Council, and featured an animated robin and owl.</p>
      <p>But the final film Frisbee, was not narrated, and struck rather a more sombre tone.</p>
      <p>The film showed two children sneaking into a substation to retrieve a frisbee, the children had seen older children sneak in the week before, and Jimmy decides to go first.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751592.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-16_47_08.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>He climbs onto a transducer, and the last thing we see is his legs on fire and his friend screaming "Jimmy".</p>
      <p>The radio plays telling viewers that a sixty six thousand volt shock killed a boy when he broke into a substation.</p>
      <p>The last scene showed a cap and school blazer lying vacant near the porch. Bleak.</p>
      <p>The film was later replaced with a film called 'Powerful Stuff' which placed a greater emphasis on older children.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>7. Tufty the Squirell, 1970s</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751770.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-16_19_48.png"/>
        <figcaption>Tufty the Squirrel's dead eyes gave some kids the creeps</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>On the surface Tufty is no more scary than any of the clangers, the Magic Roundabout characters, or Rainbow puppets of the 70s.</p>
      <p>But there's something about Tufty's lifeless eyes that unnerve people.</p>
      <p>That and the fact most of Tufty's woodland palls keep getting hit by trucks which is rather a downer for children.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20751897.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_screencapture-youtube-watch-2019-10-29-17_37_45.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Tufty's information films definitely aren't for the iPhone generation, but at the time he was a dynamite way of teaching young children about road safety.</p>
      <p>But one problem with the films lies in the fact the cartoons tone has aged really badly.</p>
      <p>Willy Weasel is hit by a car, and the Police Officer badger pretty much drags him out the road and says on your bike son, giving the pair a brief scolding of "Oh you are silly boys to play in the road".</p>
      <p>Not one person rang an ambulance, then again in those days it probably would have come rather late anyway.</p>
