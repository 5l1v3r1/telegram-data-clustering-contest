      <p>Gary Lineker appeared to confirm Ian Wright as one of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">celebrity contestants</a> heading for the I'm A Celebrity jungle on last night's Match of The Day.</p>
      <p>Host Gary mercilessly teased his co-star Ian with a series of jungle related puns during the broadcast, causing him to cackle in delight.</p>
      <p>Ian is under obligation not to confirm or deny rumours he'll be joining Ant and Dec on the ITV entertainment show, though he has been rumoured since June.</p>
      <p>Cheeky Gary began by quizzing Ian on where he will be later month, with the series returning on November 17.</p>

      <p>Gary then asked him about 'passing all the trials' and said: "You all right Ian? I'm not bugging you?"</p>

      <p>At the end of the show, Gary told viewers: "Wrighty's off to eat leaves."</p>
