處方用藥需醫師開立，兩族群應避免服用A酸
食藥署指出，市面上常見宣稱預防面皰的化粧品，常見的成分以水楊酸（salicylic acid）為大宗，限量為0.2~2％；對輕微至中等的青春痘，可至藥局諮詢醫藥專業人員並遵照指示使用，常見成分為含過氧化苯（benzoyl peroxide）的外用藥品。若治療無效，仍需尋求專業皮膚科醫師協助。
一般常使用治療痤瘡的藥品，包括口服A酸（isotretinoin）、口服抗生素，但此類藥品均屬處方藥，須經醫師診斷後開立處方，不得自行購買。
食藥署也提醒，口服A酸藥品具有致畸胎性，服用前中後期都要嚴格避孕、肝腎功能不全者也應該避免服用，並在就醫時應詳細溝通是否懷孕及病史。
初次使用抗痘藥，若有不適盡快就醫
想要成功抗痘，食藥署建議，在就醫領藥或到藥局購買藥品時，可多諮詢醫藥專業人員有關藥品使用的相關資訊，使用前也要詳讀藥品說明書並遵循使用，以發揮藥品最佳效果。
除選擇具有藥品許可證的指示藥品，以避免購買來路不明的產品外，最重要的是初次使用前，可嘗試少量用於一或兩處患部三天，觀察是否出現過敏反應。並隨時注意使用過程中，是否發生過敏反應或不適症狀，若使用後自覺狀況未改善或惡化，應立即停用並儘速就醫。
