NBA最強菜鳥努恩28分 熱火灼傷老鷹

03 Nov 2019, 08:10

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】楊恩（Trae Young）缺陣，亞特蘭大老鷹失去進攻中心，反觀邁阿密熱火新秀努恩（Kendrick　Nunn）讓人為之一亮，這位2018年選秀落選、在發展聯盟打拚的球員異軍奮起，這場攻下全場最高28分，幫助熱火以106：97再擒老鷹，收下二連勝，努恩開季5場比賽共拿下112分，比下許多新秀大物，繼2007年杜蘭特（Kevin Durant）前5戰取得113分之後，首位在生涯前5戰總得分超過100分的球員。

努恩、雷納德（Meyers Leonard）和阿德巴約（Bam Adebayo）多點開花，熱火首節30：26開出紅盤。次節，熱火攻勢凌厲，一度拉開雙位數差距，但班布里（DeAndre’ Bembry）為老鷹強拉尾盤，46：52將差距縮小到個位數。努恩下半場領軍，三分外線讓老鷹毫無招架之力，一度將分數拉開75：57，18分之多，隨後老鷹慢慢回穩，帕克（Jabari Parker）和班布里積極搶分，分數開始拉近。
讀秒前9分30秒，帕克籃下補進，分數追到83：87，赫洛（Tyler Herro）馬上用三分球喚醒沉睡的熱火，赫爾特（Kevin Huerter）和雷納德也在三分線外襄助，熱火再度將分差拉大，一路領先到最後。

NBA's strongest rookie Noon 28 points Heat burns eagle

03 Nov 2019, 08:10

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Trae Young is out of the game, the Atlanta Hawks lose their offensive center, and the Miami Heat rookie Kendrick Nunn is one of the highlights. The 2018 draft is unsuccessful. The players who developed the league's hard work have risen. The team scored a maximum of 28 points to help the Heat to pick up the Hawks at 106:97 and win two consecutive victories. Nunn scored 112 points in five games in the season. Rookie big, after the score of 113 points in the first five games of Kevin Durant in 2007, the first player who scored more than 100 points in the first five games of his career.

Noon, Meyers Leonard and Bam Adebayo blossomed, and the Heat opened the red plate at 30:26 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Heat's offensive was fierce, once the double-digit gap was opened, but DeAndre’ Bembry pulled the tail for the Hawks and narrowed the gap to single digits at 46:52. Nunn led the second half, and the three-pointer made the Hawks have no power. They once pulled the scores 75:57, 18 points, and then the Hawks slowly stabilized. Jabari Parker and Bamburi actively scored. The score starts to get closer.
9 minutes and 30 seconds before the countdown, Parker made up the basket and scored 83:87. Tyler Herro immediately used the three-pointer to wake up the sleeping heat. Kevin Huerter and Leonard also played three. Helped by the line, the Heat will once again widen the gap, leading all the way to the end.
