【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】日本沖繩縣擁有世界文化遺產的首里城，31日凌晨發生大火，燒毀包括正殿在內的7棟建築，與逾400件珍藏品毀於一旦。警方調閱閉路電視後，發現起火後不久火燄從正殿一樓噴出，基本確定起火地點在正殿一樓，3日在該處發現燒焦的配電箱，警消帶回配電箱殘骸進一步鑑定。
在勘查起火原因期間，需先清理瓦礫，警方表示，正殿內沒有從外部入侵的痕迹，認為縱火的可能性較低。
消防部門表示，事發當日正殿內遇熱報警的傳感器啟動，消防員於凌晨2時50分抵達，在此之前，閉路電視拍攝到正殿的外觀，東側有火燄向外噴出。
警衛也透露，當時他前來查看火勢時，發現正殿北側的一樓窗戶竄出猛烈黑煙。此也讓警方推測正殿一樓的北側附近所設的有配電箱為起火點。
調查人員3日到場檢證時，終於找到這個燒焦的配電箱。據悉，配電箱掌控各樓層及地板的電源設備。警方將配電箱及相關設備移出現場，將特別針對配電箱進行鑑識，確定配電箱是否跟起火原因有關。

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] Japan’s Okinawa Prefecture has a world cultural heritage in Shuri Castle. A fire broke out in the early morning of the 31st, burning seven buildings including the main hall, and more than 400 pieces were destroyed. After reviewing the CCTV, the police found that the flame was ejected from the first floor of the main hall shortly after the fire. It was basically determined that the fire was on the first floor of the main hall. On the 3rd, a charred distribution box was found there, and the police collected the wreckage of the distribution box for further identification.
During the exploration of the cause of the fire, the rubble must be cleaned first. The police said that there were no traces of invasion from the outside of the main hall and that the possibility of arson was low.
The fire department said that the sensor for the heat alarm in the main hall was started on the day of the incident. The firefighters arrived at 2:50 in the morning. Before that, CCTV photographed the appearance of the main hall and the east side had a flame.
The guard also revealed that when he came to check the fire, he found that the first floor window on the north side of the main hall was smashing black smoke. This also allowed the police to speculate that there is a distribution box near the north side of the first floor of the main hall as a fire point.
When the investigators arrived at the scene on the 3rd, they finally found the charred distribution box. It is reported that the distribution box controls the power equipment of each floor and floor. The police moved the distribution box and related equipment to the scene, and specifically identified the distribution box to determine whether the distribution box is related to the cause of the fire.
