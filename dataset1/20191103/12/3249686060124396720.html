      <p>BTS V is known to attract locals not only in their own country but it can be remembered that he  has also topped Japan Yahoo searches as non-BTS fans were hyped to know who "the guy in yellow shirt" is,  trended in Weibo (China's top social media platform) as the handsome guy in blue hair, and during their concert in Saudi Arabia, enthralled locals who asked for "the guy with the green mic', to name a few. </p>
