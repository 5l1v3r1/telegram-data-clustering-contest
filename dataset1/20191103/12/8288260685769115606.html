      <p>Police have erected a cordon outside an empty restaurant opposite a Nando's in Staffordshire.</p>
      <p>The empty restaurant has been cordoned off by officers after cops swooped amid reports of an attack on a man.</p>
      <p>The male was attacked overnight in Staffs, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/police-cordon-empty-restaurant-opposite-3496976">StokeonTrentLive</a> , our sister title in the region.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to the scene at Etruria Mills, Hanley, at 4.50am this morning following reports of an assault overnight.</p>
      <p>The victim, aged 38, has been taken to hospital following the incident, but his condition is not known at this stage.</p>
