      <p>JOHANNESBURG, Nov 3 — The Springboks’ Rugby World Cup triumph was hailed by South African newspapers today as an “inspiration” to a nation suffering from racial tensions, unemployment and violence.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s first black captain Siya Kolisi “and his Boks have lessons in unity for all of us” suggested the <i>Sunday Times</i>.</p>
      <p>“There was something beautiful about the symbolism of Yokohama,” the paper wrote about yesterday’s 32-12 win over England.</p>
      <p>For the <i>Sunday Independent</i> “the Boks have inspired their country”.</p>
      <p>“It is the responsibility of the rest of South Africa to take their cue from the Boks, put aside their petty squabbles and put their country first,” its editorial said.</p>
      <p>The paper recalled that since the ending of apartheid in 1994 “the Springbok emblem quite understandably has been the centre of heated emotions given its former apartheid connotations”.</p>
      <p>But as a result of Nelson Mandela’s decision during the 1995 tournament to embrace it as a means of reconciliation, “it survived and now has the potential to grow into a rallying point for all South Africans”.</p>
      <p>“The image of Siya Kolisi, the first black Springbok captain, hoisting aloft the Webb Ellis Cup is as iconic as the one of Madiba congratulating Francois Pienaar in ‘95”.</p>
      <p>The <i>Times</i> dwelt on the significance of Kolisi’s “wise words” after the final whistle in Japan.</p>
      <p>“We have so many problems in our country but a team like this, we come from different backgrounds, different races but we came together with one goal and we wanted to achieve it,” the captain said.</p>
      <p>“I really hope we’ve done that for South Africa. Just shows that we can pull together if we want to achieve something.”</p>
      <p>The paper said Kolisi’s comments “apply hugely to the economy”.</p>
      <p>Its front page ran the headline “Siyabonga” — ‘thank you’ in Zulu — with the skipper’s first name ‘Siya’ highlighted. — AFP</p>
