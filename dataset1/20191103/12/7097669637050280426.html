      <h1>Airbnb to ban ‘party houses’ after five people killed in mass shooting at Halloween event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:16:42+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Samuel Osborne</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/airbnb">Airbnb</a> has said it will ban “party houses” in the wake of a deadly shooting at a Halloween party at a rented property in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/California">California</a>.</p>
      <p>Five people were killed in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/orinda-mass-shooting-today-california-halloween-contra-costa-police-gunman-a9180441.html">the shooting on Thursday</a>, which sent around 100 terrified partygoers running for their lives in the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> suburb of Orinda.</p>
      <p>The four-bedroom home had been rented on Airbnb by a woman who told the owner her dozen family members had asthma and needed to escape smoke from a wildfire, a person with knowledge of the transaction said.</p>
      <p>The owner was suspicious of a one-night rental on Halloween and before agreeing reminded the renter that no parties were allowed.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said Saturday the San Francisco-based company is expanding manual screening of “high risk” reservations and will remove guests who fail to comply with policies banning parties at Airbnb rental homes.</p>
      <p>Mr Chesky also said the company is forming a “rapid response team” when complaints of unauthorised parties come in.</p>
      <p>“We must do better, and we will. This is unacceptable,” <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1190675126594879489">he tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the shooting on Thursday night, the owner of the property, Michael Wang, said his wife reached out to the renter after neighbours contacted them about the party.</p>
      <p>The renter said there were only a dozen people at the home but Mr Wang said he could see more people on video from his doorbell camera.</p>
      <p>“We called the police. They were on the way to go there to stop them, but before we got there the neighbour already sent us a message saying there was a shooting,” he told the <i>Chronicle</i>.</p>
      <p>No arrests had been made and there was no immediate word on a motive for the attack.</p>
      <p>Two guns were found at the property, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Three people, all from the Bay Area, died at the scene and a fourth died at the hospital, authorities initially said.</p>
      <p>The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office identified them on Friday evening as Tiyon Farley, 22; Omar Taylor, 24; Ramon Hill Jr, 23; and Javin County, 29.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office identified a fifth victim, 19-year-old Oshiana Tompkins, late on Friday night, saying she died at a hospital.</p>
      <p>The party at the four-bedroom house was apparently advertised on social media as an “Airbnb mansion party”.</p>
