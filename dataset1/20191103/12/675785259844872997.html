      <p>The X Factor: Celebrity has denied claims pop group No Love Lost - made up of Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-wes-nelson-everything-you-12611484">Wes Nelson</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-love-islands-zara-mcdermott-12724738">Zara McDermott</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-samira-mighty-love-island-12611246">Samira Mighty</a> and Eyal Booker - were miming on Saturday night's show.</p>
      <p>The ITV talent show have claimed it is "categorically not true" that the foursome were lip-syncing after viewers of the series accused the band on social media.</p>
      <p>Shutting down the rumours, an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> Spokeswoman told Mirror Online: "This is categorically not true. All of the acts sang live on Saturday nights show - as they always do, including No Love Lost."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The denial came after viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> accuse the Love Island contestants of miming during their rendition of Would I Lie To You? by Charles and Eddie.</p>
      <p>"Been watching this for 5 minutes and can already see that love island group are miming," scathed one.</p>
      <p>Another fired: "Omg are love island band MIMING the chorus?"</p>
      <p>"Little tip to the Love Islanders... If you wanna convincingly mime, maybe start with actually holding the microphone to your mouth?!" quipped a third.</p>

      <p>But Simon Cowell was clearly impressed as he pressed the golden buzzer to send them through to the next round.</p>
      <p>While a source, who was at the live show, also shared: "No Love Lost put in a great performance and are looking forward to performing again next week.</p>
      <p>"They’ve been working so hard with their vocals, and it’s obviously working as Simon gave them a seat and they’re through to the third live show!"</p>

      <p>Another joked: "Wow is simon on drugs <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XFactorCelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#XFactorCelebrity</a> that performance from No Love Lost made me feel sick."</p>
      <p>"No Love Lost got a safe seat? But they were c**p. (Well cr***ier than the others so far) <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/xfactorcelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#xfactorcelebrity</a> ," jibbed an unimpressed fan.</p>
