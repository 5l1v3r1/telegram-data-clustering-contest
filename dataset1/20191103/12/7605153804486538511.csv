Patrick Ndimubazi from Rwanda’s health of state in charge of public health says this will be done through increasing domestic budgetary allocation for health, ensuring necessary policies are in place and by investing in human resources for health among others.
“We shall also promote strategies and approaches that ensure involvement of adolescents and youth in policies, programmes and strategies development and ensure that they access age appropriate quality information, comprehensive knowledge and education.”
The ministers also said they would ensure availability of access to menstrual hygiene management, treatment and prevention for reproductive system cancers, fertility treatment and post-abortion care as per the laws of respective countries.
The commitment was made after they raised an alarm on the persistent high levels of maternal and newborn deaths due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth.

In East Africa, Rwanda has an unmet need for family planning at 23.3 percent, Kenya is at 20.1 percent, Uganda at 34 percent, Tanzania at 27 percent and Burundi at 30.2 percent.
