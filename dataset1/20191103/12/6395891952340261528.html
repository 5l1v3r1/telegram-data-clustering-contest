      <p><b>PARISÂ (AP)</b> - A French minister says the new Brexit date of Jan. 31 "is not negotiable" and "the risk of a no-deal Brexit remains."</p>
      <p>Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin tells Europe 1 radio on Sunday that she's advising French companies to continue preparing for a scenario in which Britain leaves the bloc on Jan. 31 without a divorce deal, despite getting a three-month Brexit extension from the European Union.</p>
      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31 with or without a deal but the British Parliament blocked his plans. Now Britain is holding a Dec. 12 election and Johnson hopes to get a more Brexit-friendly Parliament.</p>
      <p>Montchalin defended France's earlier fight not to extend the Brexit deadline, saying French businesses and families needed "clarity" on the issue.</p>
