      <p>LONDON (AP) — Minshew Mania was a passing fad in London.</p>
      <p>It could be all but over by the time the Jaguars get back to Jacksonville.</p>
      <p>Rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew’s last chance to stake his claim on the Jaguars starting job before Nick Foles returns from his broken collarbone was a bust.</p>
      <p>Rattled by defenders who weren’t always there, the mustachioed star-in-waiting led his team to a mere field goal in a 26-3 throttling at the hands of the Houston Texans on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He threw for 309 yards, most of them in garbage time.</p>
      <p>The other numbers were more telling: 27 for 47. Two interceptions. Two lost fumbles. A bevy of off-target throws. Passer rating of 59.6.</p>
      <p>He was sacked four times, but those all came in the second half, after Jacksonville had abandoned any notion of trying to run.</p>
      <p>Of his first 24 drop-backs, all of which came when the game was still competitive, he wasn’t pressured once. But he amassed only 145 yards passing during that stretch, and only a single trip inside the Houston 20.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>And now, it’s decision time for coach Doug Marrone, who will have two weeks to review Gardner’s play and assess Foles’ health.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a lot of questions, and I’m not naïve,” Marrone said. “And it’s not one game. It’ll be a body of work.”</p>
      <p>Foles, the veteran Super Bowl-winning QB who signed an $88 million contract in the offseason, is expected to return from his Week 1 injury after Jacksonville’s bye. The Jaguars play at Indianapolis on Nov. 17.</p>
      <p>Minshew’s first start came in Week 2, also against Houston, and though he was far from perfect, he led a late touchdown drive and had the Jaguars within a 2-point-conversion try of pulling out the win.</p>
      <p>He went 4-2 over the next six games and looked like anything but a rookie in compiling a passer rating of 134 on down-the-field throws. He didn’t throw many deep balls in the encore against Houston, at least not while the game was competitive. It was still a 9-3 game late in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>It didn’t help that Jacksonville’s running game was non-existent. Leonard Fournette had 26 yards in the first half, and 40 for the game.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>In making his decision, Marrone will have to wade through some other troubling numbers: Minshew’s wins came against teams with a combined record of 7-24 coming into Sunday. Meanwhile, the quarterback mustered one touchdown in eight quarters against the Texans, whose two-game advantage over the Jaguars in the AFC South is more like three because they own the tiebreaker.</p>
      <p>Jacksonville still has two games left against the Colts, who came into Sunday holding the division lead. The math is even more complicated because of Foles’ massive contract, a clear factor even in a season that is beginning to feel lost.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to step away a little bit, take a break because I don’t have to make a decision,” Marrone said. “And then I’ll tell them probably right before we come back (next) Sunday.”</p>
      <p>Minshew’s take on his job status? It’s anyone’s guess. He walked out of his postgame news conference after one question: Talk about the frustration of the day.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, it sucks, man. Didn’t execute at times, didn’t make plays we needed to win. So yeah, it’s no fun,” he said.</p>
