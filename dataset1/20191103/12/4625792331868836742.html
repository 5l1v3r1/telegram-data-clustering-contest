      <p><b>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa —⁠ </b>Joe Biden mistakenly said he was in Ohio rather than Iowa, the latest error by the former vice president as he tries to lock down support in the first state to vote in the 2020 Democratic nominating season.</p>
      <p>“How many unsafe bridges do you still have here in the state of Ohio? I mean Iowa,” Biden said in Cedar Rapids on Saturday in response to a question about infrastructure. “I was just in Ohio. Because they have more."</p>

      <p>The misstep didn't go unnoticed by attendees at the fundraiser for Democratic candidates, hosted by first-term Iowa Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer.</p>
      <p>"At the fish fry in Cedar Rapids, Biden says he’s in Ohio instead of Iowa. Quickly corrects himself but I spotted some in the crowd shaking their heads,” the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>'s Tarini Parti tweeted.</p>

      <p>Kathleen Tupker, 39, shrugged off the mistake, saying "it happens a lot."</p>
      <p>"He corrected himself right away," said the stay-at-home mother from Marion, Iowa. "There were a few giggles from the audience. It wasn’t super pronounced."</p>
      <p>In August, Biden, 76, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-mixes-up-new-hampshire-and-vermont-while-campaigning-in-the-former">confused New Hampshire for Vermont</a> during a campaign stop in Keene.</p>
      <p>His fumble followed a disruption at the opening of a new field office in Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>"The press wants very much, and some of the opponents, want to very much categorize views in terms of whether you're thinking big. And if you're criticize something that you think is outlandish, you must be Republican," the 36-year Delaware senator said before getting interrupted by protesters. "The vision I have for this country, there is nothing small about it. It is like going to the moon."</p>
      <p>Biden supporters tried to drown out the Sunrise Movement demonstrators, who bore a sign saying, “Biden bought out by big oil,” but the two-term vice president told them to let the protesters speak.</p>
      <p>"This is not Republican time," he said.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators, however, walked out chanting, "Which side are you on?" before Biden could address his concerns.</p>
      <p>“Folks, if you noticed, they left before I had could answer the question, number one. Number two, this is what is going on that's wrong with our party right now: that everything is taken in context that are not accurate," he said.</p>
