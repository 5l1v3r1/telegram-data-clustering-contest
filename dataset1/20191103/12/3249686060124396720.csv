""He has a well-defined face and is just so handsome""


""He has a sharp nose and his face is so perfect""


""When he smiles his mouth is like heart-shaped, it's so cute""


""If I see BTS, I only see V among them'

These are just someof the answers given by Korean GP ( general public ) as they chose BTS V as the Most Handsome BTS member, when they were asked on the street by JerryRic, a You Tube channel which conducted the survey, ""Asking Koreans to Pick the  Most Handsome BTS member"" .



BTS V is known to attract locals not only in their own country but it can be remembered that he  has also topped Japan Yahoo searches as non-BTS fans were hyped to know who ""the guy in yellow shirt"" is,  trended in Weibo (China's top social media platform) as the handsome guy in blue hair, and during their concert in Saudi Arabia, enthralled locals who asked for ""the guy with the green mic', to name a few. 












BTS V did not only snatch the attention of locals. Early this year, in a survey done with 100 Kpop Idols in JTBC's Idol room, he again topped the survey as the Most handsome Idol overall. Even Kpop Idols agree that BTS V's visuals will always be a stand out!






BTS V  the  ""stan attractor"" with his exquisite visuals that no one could resist, combined with skills, talents and great personality to boot continue to captivate locals and has proven to have contributed to the many fans of Global Superstars BTS, who have just concluded their Speak Yourself Tour with a successful concert in Seoul's  Gymnastic Stadium.
