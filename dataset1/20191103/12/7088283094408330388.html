      <p>Emergency services attended to hundreds of callouts as gusts dropped trees on roads and railway tracks and tore loose live electrical cables.</p>
      <p>No deaths or injuries have been reported so far.</p>
      <p>Weather service Meteo France said winds as strong as 163 km/h were recorded in the coastal departments of Gironde and Landes, and 121 km/h in Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>Electricity supplier Enedis said it was working round the clock to restore electricity to some 140,000 customers left without power by the storm.</p>
      <p>In the Landes department, 47 people had to be evacuated from a camp site, and a casino roof collapsed.</p>
      <p>Several trains in the area were cancelled or delayed, according to the SNCF railway operator.</p>
