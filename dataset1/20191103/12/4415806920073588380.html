      <h1>Army specialists meet Turkish officials to assess Lisa Smith rescue operation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:21:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A team from the Irish Defence Forces, accompanied by members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is understood to have travelled to Turkey to investigate a possible route out of Syria for Irish citizen Lisa Smith and her two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>'Isis bride' Smith, who is linked to Islamic State, escaped from a Kurdish forces detainment camp in Syria last month. It is believed she is now being detained close to Syria's border with Turkey.</p>
      <p>It is understood that a repatriation effort for Smith and her daughter is being assessed.</p>
      <p>It was reported last month that Smith could be among thousands of ISIS fighters who could go free as the United States looked to move troops out of the region.</p>
      <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said at the time: â€œAs in all cases where Irish citizens are in distress or danger overseas, the Department will continue to engage with partners and provide appropriate consular advice and assistance.</p>
      <p>"Given the particularly volatile and complex situation in the region in this case, it would not be helpful to comment on specific cases or any possible course of action."</p>
