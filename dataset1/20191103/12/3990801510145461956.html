      <h1>For $29, you can turn virtually anything in your home into a smart device with this training</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T12:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/tnwdeals/" target="_blank">TNW Deals</a></address>
      <p><b>TLDR:</b> The Mastering Internet of Things Bundle will show you how to build your own smart devices — and even get you started making some — for under $30.</p>
      <p>Even if you aren’t a tech tinkerer, the concept behind the Internet of Things is bound to fascinate. With WiFi capabilities expanding and the proliferation of web-enabled devices putting sensors in almost everything, it’s never been easier to connect virtually any electronic device to the Internet. </p>
      <p>And with that type of connectivity driving everything from coffee makers and lamps to washing machines and wearable tech, how long before somebody creates <a href="https://www.valpashotels.com/technology">autonomous bed bug catchers</a> or <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2017/10/24/this-130-noise-canceling-ramen-fork-is-the-dumbest-gadget-of-2017/">noise-cancelling forks</a>? Oh wait, someone already did!</p>
      <p>Understanding the Internet of Things is the core of creating both innovative and silly smart devices — and you can get to the core of that learning with <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-345263&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRI&amp;scsonar=1">The Mastering Internet of Things Bundle</a>. It’s currently on sale at <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-345263&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRI&amp;scsonar=1">over 90 percent off the regular price, just $29</a>, from TNW Deals.</p>
      <p>The nine courses featured in this collection fall into two categories: courses that explain the ideas and hardware used in creating web-driven smart objects; and courses that get you started actually building your own uber-creations.</p>
      <p>Once you’re finished understanding IoT basics, popular IoT environments like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and even Zigbee (best explained as a sort of WiFi for low-powered devices), that’s when you start rolling up your sleeves and getting to work.</p>
      <p>The training walks you through how to build cool stuff like your own heart rate sensor, devices to wirelessly control electrical outlets, a water temperature gauge, or your own aeroponics farm.</p>
      <p>Each course in the bundle retails for $200 separately, but by getting this collection at TNW Deals’ limited-time price, the whole assortment is <a href="https://deals.thenextweb.com/sales/the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle?utm_source=thenextweb.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-mastering-internet-of-things-bundle&amp;utm_term=scsf-345263&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004MpRI&amp;scsonar=1">only $29, just over $3 each</a>.</p>
