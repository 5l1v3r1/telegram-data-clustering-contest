      <p>We cannot ignore the fact that road safety isn’t the best in our country. Its state is quite the opposite. Cases like overspeeding, helmetless riding, and driving on the wrong side happen every minute and accidents occur every day. Even though the government has imposed strict rules and stricter fines on traffic violations, some just won’t learn.</p>
      <p>According to a report by India Today, a car carrying 5 people fell into a river after it tried to avoid a collision with an autorickshaw coming in full speed in its direction. The incident occurred in Orchha town of Madhya Pradesh’s Niwari district at a narrow bridge over a river.</p>
      <p>A CCTV footage of the incident shows how after falling into the river, two men climbed outside the car and pulled out a child. To save the baby from drowning, the man tried throwing the child in the hands of people standing on the bridge. However, people were unable to catch the child and one of them jumped into the river to save him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the autorickshaw fled the spot. Watch the video here:</p>

      <p>While the scary video had netizens thanking the people for protecting the child’s life, many pointed out how the collision could have been avoided if either one of them hadn’t driven on the wrong side.</p>
      <p>The child and the other car passengers suffered minor injuries and were later rushed to the hospital. They were lucky to have survived, but the accident could have been avoided altogether if basic road safety rules were followed.</p>
