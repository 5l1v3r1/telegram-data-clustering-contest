      </p>
      <p>Chrissy Teigen has shared footage of her “wine drunk” husband, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/john-legend">John Legend</a>, performing a distinctly slurred rendition of his hit ‘All of Me’ during a night out at Universal Studios on Friday (November 1).</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old singer surprised attendees by jumping on stage in a red onesie, embroidered with an image of Legend’s own face, and launching into the 2013 single. “John got wine drunk and sang a song at universal studios last night,” Teigen captioned the clip on Twitter, who can be seen laughing at the bravado performance while onlookers cheer him on. Watch the video below.</p>

      <p>The musician is reissuing his first Christmas album, ‘A Legendary Christmas’, on November 8 – including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/john-legend-and-kelly-clarkson-cover-baby-its-cold-outside-for-metoo-era-2562154">an updated version of ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside’</a> which garnered attention for altering some of the song’s problematic lyrics.</p>
      <p>The song, which debuted in 1944, faced<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/more-us-radio-stations-are-banning-baby-its-cold-outside-2417681"> boycotts from radio stations last Christmas </a>after commentators suggested that it raised serious questions about sexual consent.</p>
      <p>It was argued that one line of the back-and-forth song – “Say what’s in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)” – was a reference to date rape.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/john-legend-and-chrissy-teigen-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a>, Legend said he and co-writer Natasha Rothwell had penned some contemporary lyrics for the song, which sees him joining forces with <i>American Idol</i> winner Clarkson.</p>
      <p>The new version includes the lines: “What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice) / If I have one more drink? (It’s your body, and your choice).”</p>
