      <p>Now that, uhhh, section is over, let’s get into some more information.</p>
      <p>Of course, AirPods aren’t for everyone (<a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/02/20/angel-devil-buy-apple-airpods-bluetooth-earbuds/">something we’ve discussed in more detail here</a>), but I’ve found them to be an incredibly usable true wireless headphone that delivers a slick experience — especially when combined with an Apple device.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for audiophile-quality sound, then AirPods with wireless charging case might not be the best. But what they do offer is an unrivalled overall experience, from build quality, to battery life, and to sound, the AirPods might be the finest balanced true wireless headphones around.</p>
      <p>Anyway, if that sounds like something you’re interested in, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/?tag=tnw88-20">head over over to pick up the AirPods with wireless charging case for only $165</a>. Enjoy that sweet sound, Apple fans.</p>
