The X Factor: Celebrity has denied claims pop group No Love Lost - made up of Love Island's Wes Nelson , Zara McDermott , Samira Mighty and Eyal Booker - were miming on Saturday night's show.
The ITV talent show have claimed it is ""categorically not true"" that the foursome were lip-syncing after viewers of the series accused the band on social media.
Shutting down the rumours, an X Factor Spokeswoman told Mirror Online: ""This is categorically not true. All of the acts sang live on Saturday nights show - as they always do, including No Love Lost.""

The denial came after viewers took to Twitter accuse the Love Island contestants of miming during their rendition of Would I Lie To You? by Charles and Eddie.
""Been watching this for 5 minutes and can already see that love island group are miming,"" scathed one.
Another fired: ""Omg are love island band MIMING the chorus?""
""Little tip to the Love Islanders... If you wanna convincingly mime, maybe start with actually holding the microphone to your mouth?!"" quipped a third.

But Simon Cowell was clearly impressed as he pressed the golden buzzer to send them through to the next round.
While a source, who was at the live show, also shared: ""No Love Lost put in a great performance and are looking forward to performing again next week.
""They’ve been working so hard with their vocals, and it’s obviously working as Simon gave them a seat and they’re through to the third live show!""


Later in the show, fans were left baffled when music mogul Simon Cowell awarded the group with a safe seat - meaning they received an automatic place onto next week's show (Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)

One shocked viewer wrote: ""Wait Cowell gave No Love lost a Seat what on earth was he thinking. They are bloody awful. This is why his shows are dying. #XFactorCelebrity .""


It came as a result of viewers blasting the group on Twitter

Another joked: ""Wow is simon on drugs #XFactorCelebrity that performance from No Love Lost made me feel sick.""
""No Love Lost got a safe seat? But they were c**p. (Well cr***ier than the others so far) #xfactorcelebrity ,"" jibbed an unimpressed fan.
