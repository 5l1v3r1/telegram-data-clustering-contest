Tonight's results show saw head judge Motsi Mabuse shimmy onto the Strictly Come Dancing ballroom in an unusual dress.
The judge, 38, baffled viewers as she stepped out in a blush-coloured frilly dress with sheer layered detailing and dramatic lace ruffles.
The glamorous professional started the seventh results show with the eye-catching look, but viewers weren't so keen with the quirky number.
Strictly fans quickly fled to Twitter to comment on the judge's dress choice and compare it to a 'sheep'.

One user posted: ""Why is Motsi Mabuse dressed like a sheep!!""
While another shared: ""Motsi looks like the end of a roll of fabric.""
A third fan commented: ""Do you think Motsi has ever met a ruffle she didn't like?""
Another viewer swiped: ""I like Motsi but that dress is horrifying.""

Similar to yesterday, she sporting a very classic, yet a no less bold, look - a trouser and blouse combo.

The nine surviving pairs now dance past the competition’s halfway mark with the highly-anticipated Blackpool Tower Ballroom episode just two routines away.
Tonight's results show kicked off with an Elton John inspired group dance, as well as a musical performance from award-winning singer and songwriter Emelie Sande, performing her single Shine.
The two couples facing the dreaded dance-off are Mike Bushell and Katya Jones against Viscountess Emma Weymouth and Aljaž Škorjanec.
