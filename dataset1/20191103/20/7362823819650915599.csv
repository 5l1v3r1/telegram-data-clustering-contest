A father and son are dead and the child’s mother is critically injured after they were struck by an SUV driven by a man suspected of driving under the influence (DUI) on Halloween night in Southern California, police told Fox News on Sunday.
The crash unfolded just before 10 p.m. in Long Beach, according to a news release.
Police said the alleged DUI driver, identified as 20-year-old Carlo Navarro of Long Beach, slammed into the family on Thursday night. Paramedics rushed all three relatives to the hospital in critical condition. The 30-year-old father died at the hospital that night and his 3-year-old son died at the hospital on Saturday morning, Long Beach police said, adding that the child’s mother was still critical.

Navarro was arrested at the scene and a DUI investigation was launched, which included a toxicology, police said, adding that he was booked for driving under the influence and gross vehicular manslaughter.
