      <p>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — El Salvador's top Roman Catholic cleric apologized Sunday for the alleged sexual abuse by a priest of an unidentified minor 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>"We have apologized to the victim and now I am repeating it publicly, and we also ask for forgiveness from the community for the scandal that this has caused," San Salvador Archbishop José Luis Escobar Alas said in a news conference after celebrating Mass.</p>
      <p>"At the same time we pray for the victim and also for the priest," he said.</p>
      <p>The victim was received by the Archdiocese's Commission on Childhood Protection, which according to Escobar, "found merit in their accusation and suggested that the proper canonical process be initiated."</p>
      <p>The priest, identified as Leopoldo Sosa Tolentino, was suspended, the archbishop said.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the church defrocked three Salvadoran priests after they were found guilty of sexually abusing children.</p>
      <p>This year, it defrocked another following a canonical process in which the priest confessed guilt; he was also convicted in a Salvadoran court and sentenced to 16 years in prison.</p>
      <p>The abuse scandals came to light in November 2015 when the San Salvador archbishop dismissed a priest accused of raping a girl over nearly a decade.</p>
