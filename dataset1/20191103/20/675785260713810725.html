      <p>The Nissan is understood to have crossed the road, mounted the pavement and smashed a trellis fence before ploughing halfway through a pub window.</p>
      <p>People were left pinned against the wall while others were trapped underneath the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the investigation say it is not believed the collision was a targeted attack.</p>
      <p>Witnesses say revellers were laughing and joking in the smoking area shortly before the crash.</p>

      <p>Regulars say the man who died had been enjoying an evening meal at the pub with his wife.</p>
      <p>One friend said: “It is so weird we were just laughing and joking and now he is dead.</p>
      <p>“It was an average night out, you would never expect that to happen."</p>
      <p>It is understood Ian Winter, 34, was in hospital with life-changing injuries to his legs and hips, and his friend Carl Joyner, 33, was less seriously injured.</p>

      <p>A 34-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the Nissan, suffered minor injuries and is said to have been seen having a panic attack following the crash.</p>
      <p>Friends Mr Winter and Mr Joyner, who play football together, met at the pub after watching the Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa earlier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mr Winter's half-brother, James Howard, said: “I don't know the full extent of his injuries, he is under sedation and being monitored.</p>
      <p>“As far as I know he had been out for the rugby in the morning and then this happened.</p>

      <p>“It's devastating, I'm still in shock – I hope he pulls through.</p>
      <p>“Whatever the future now holds for him his friends and family will be there for him.”</p>
      <p>Mr Joyner's stepmum, Tina Joyner, said: “He is in Colchester Hospital.</p>
      <p>“I have no idea what happened, all I know is they were standing in the smoking area and this car ploughed into them.</p>

      <p>“He was just down the pub having a drink with his friends and this happened.”</p>
      <p>In the aftermath, witnesses described a harrowing scene.</p>
      <p>Neighbour Simone Rowe said: “I spoke to a chap who was in there at the time and he was just playing pool.</p>

      <p>“There were people trapped under the car and they were pinned against the wall.</p>
      <p>“I came back home and saw the paramedics wheeling out the dead body."</p>

      <p>The man, who gave his name as Sean, said his friend was airlifted to hospital by helicopter with two broken legs, two broken hips and possibly a broken sternum.</p>
      <p>He added: "I was devastated, absolutely devastated.</p>
      <p>"He has injuries from the waist down, and someone was saying maybe head injuries, but I'm waiting for updates at the moment.</p>
      <p>"He was with a group of about four people. All I know is the car just ploughed straight into the pub."</p>

      <p>Police said the suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder, GBH with intent, death by dangerous driving and assault.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman added: "Tragically a 36 year-old man died at the scene.</p>
      <p>“A 34 year-old man has been taken to hospital with life-changing injuries and two others, a 34 year-old woman and a 33 year-old man, were also taken to hospital with minor injuries."</p>
      <p>Police tape surrounded the Spinnaker pub on Sunday morning and the remains of a trellis could be seen hanging off the blue wooden frame around a small roofed outside area.</p>
      <p>Debris including bricks were seen on the ground under the roof.</p>
      <p>A large wooden board has been placed over part of the pub's wall but broken mortar and bare bricks can be seen behind it.</p>
      <p>Long cracks run up the wall and around a broken sign, the other half of which was lying on the ground.</p>
