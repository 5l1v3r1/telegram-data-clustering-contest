      <p>Jason Momoa's Aquaman got plenty of face-time with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468182/ben-affleck-would-still-totally-direct-a-dc-movie">Ben Affleck's Batman</a> in <i>Justice League</i>, but now that Affleck is out and Robert Pattinson is in, will they cross paths in a movie too?</p>
      <p>Matt Reeves' <i>The Batman</i> is part of the DC Comics universe but maybe not eager for DCEU connections. Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465445/dc-isnt-as-focused-on-its-shared-movie-universe-anymore">moved away from its focus</a> on a "shared universe" after the relative disappointment of <i>Justice League</i> to focus more on individual movies. <i>Joker</i> is an example of that, and it has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479584/todd-phillips-explains-why-joker-isnt-connected-to-the-dceu">no direct ties to the DCEU</a>.</p>
      <p>Jason Momoa is now everywhere promoting his <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2483708/jason-momoa-felt-cheated-by-game-of-thrones-and-other-roles-before-see">new TV show <i>See</i></a>, and fielding questions on Aquaman -- and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">The Snyder Cut</a> of <i>Justice League</i> -- along the way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRqEC294iZc">ET</a> asked him for his reaction to Robert Pattinson being cast as Batman, and he was all praise:</p>
      <blockquote>I’m really stoked. He’s a good man, he’s a great actor. I’m excited about the whole thing.</blockquote>
      <p>The whole thing of <i>The Batman</i> includes Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman. Jason Momoa is married to Kravitz's mother, Lisa Bonet, so he's her stepfather. Momoa recently talked about how he reacted to Kravitz's casting, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482935/jason-momoa-reveals-how-he-congratulated-zoe-kravitz-on-catwoman-role">warning her that her life would change</a> just as his did after <i>Aquaman</i>.</p>
      <p>Here's what Jason Momoa had to say about the idea of Robert Pattinson's Batman, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman, and Momoa's own Aquaman ever being in a movie together:</p>
      <blockquote>I mean, it’d be awesome, but I don’t think it’s going that way. Let’s just let them do their thing and I’ll do my thing.</blockquote>
      <p>It does seem like <i>The Batman</i> is going to be its own thing, but it would also be awesome for DC to reconnect its iconic characters -- as long as they could find a natural way to do it. Not something forced.</p>
      <p>A couple of years ago, Matt Reeves surprised DC fans with this <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1695440/wait-is-the-batman-solo-movie-even-part-of-the-dceu-heres-what-matt-reeves-says">statement about his movie</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>When they approached me, what they said was, 'Look, it's a standalone. This isn't part of the extended universe.'</blockquote>
      <p>Matt Reeves later <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1695819/matt-reeves-clarifies-whether-the-batman-solo-movie-fits-into-the-dceu">clarified what he meant</a> by that:</p>
      <blockquote>Just to be clear: Of COURSE Batman will be part of the D.C. Universe. Batman will be BATMAN. In my comments from a while back about not being part of the DCEU, I was talking about <i>The Batman</i> being a story specifically about Batman, not about the others in the Universe. That it wouldn't be filled with cameos servicing other stories -- that it would be a BATMAN story.</blockquote>
      <p>It sounds like <i>The Batman</i> might be too packed with other characters for any <i>Justice League</i> characters to drop by -- besides, Arthur Curry might wonder why Bruce Wayne suddenly looks so different. (They could cover that with a one-off joke, though.)</p>
      <p>Robert Pattinson is now in training for <i>The Batman</i>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483707/see-how-robert-pattinson-has-started-training-for-the-batman">doing some floor rolls</a>, if nothing else. In addition to Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, the movie has also cast Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, and Paul Dano as The Riddler.</p>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> is currently scheduled to open in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2466137/the-batman">June 2021</a>, just two months before DC's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2466134/the-suicide-squad"><i>The Suicide Squad</i></a>, which is bringing back several stars and characters from <i>Suicide Squad</i> while adding many more. Will Robert Pattinson's Batman have any crossover with THAT movie? Writer/director James Gunn <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477926/is-batman-in-the-suicide-squad-james-gunn-reveals-the-truth">addressed that idea</a>. Meanwhile, Jason Momoa's <i>Aquaman</i> sequel has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471378/aquaman-2-what-we-know-so-far">a 2022 release date</a>, and you never know what The Powers That Be might want to do by then.</p>
      <p>Maybe it's too soon to know what you want from Robert Pattinson's Batman, but do you hope he ever connects in a movie with Jason Momoa's Aquaman or should their worlds <i>not</i> collide?</p>
