      <p>REVENUE officers were granted a three-month cash detention order by Judge Fiona Lydon at Ballina District Court on Friday. This follows the seizure of over €80,000 on Thursday when, as part of an intelligence led operation, Revenue officers, with the assistance of detector dog Bailey, searched a house in Co. Mayo.</p>
      <p>During the search, officers also seized over 45,000 cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The unstamped cigarettes, branded ‘Blue River’ and ‘Email’, have an estimated retail value of over €22,000 with a potential loss to the Exchequer of over €19,000.</p>
      <p>A male in his fifties was questioned in relation to the seizures and investigations are ongoing, the Revenue press office has reported.</p>
      <p>The seizures are part of ongoing operations targeting the supply and sale of illegal tobacco products in the shadow economy. If businesses or members of the public have any information regarding the smuggling or illegal sale of tobacco products, they can contact Revenue in confidence on free-phone number 1800 295 295.</p>
