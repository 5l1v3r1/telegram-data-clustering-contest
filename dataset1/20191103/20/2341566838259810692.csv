韓粉直播惹議 民進黨：干擾採訪自由將驅離報警

（中央社記者葉素萍、王承中台北3日電）國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜支持者前往民進黨造勢活動，直播媒體發稿區惹議。民進黨對此表示，未經同意就拍攝媒體工作，直接指涉記者是「1450」網軍恐違法，未來將驅離干擾新聞採訪自由的人，甚至報警處理。
國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜競辦發言人葉元之則呼籲各陣營支持者互相尊重，希望讓媒體工作不受干擾。
總統蔡英文昨天替立委參選人張宏陸站台造勢，有支持韓國瑜的網路直播主到媒體發稿區開直播，民進黨中央今天透過聲明指出，對於未經同意就拍攝記者工作，並將名字公開上網，直接指涉記者是「1450」網軍，民進黨表示強烈譴責，此舉不僅不尊重人、干擾新聞專業，也極度缺乏基本禮貌，甚至已違反民法與個人資料保護法所規定的民刑事責任。
民進黨未來將強化記者在現場採訪的權益維護，若再發現不友善人士，企圖干擾新聞採訪自由，將現場驅離，甚至報警處理。對於「1450」網軍的說法，民進黨也嚴正駁斥，表示臉書直播公開散布不實訊息，已構成刑法妨害名譽罪嫌，請相關人士自重，民進黨不排除進一步採取法律行動。
對於韓國瑜支持者直播惹議，葉元之今天接受媒體聯訪時表示，他有去了解這件事情，有這樣的行為，記者也會感到非常不愉快，可能會干擾到記者採訪，呼籲不管哪個陣營的支持者，大家要互相尊重，能夠避免就儘量避免，希望能讓媒體在不受干擾的環境下工作。
葉元之指出，他有看了該名韓粉的直播影片，一般民眾可能沒跟媒體接觸過，感覺是不太了解媒體採訪的流程，但拍攝到記者電腦螢幕並直播出去，有牽涉到個人隱私問題，應要避免。
韓國瑜今天沒有公開行程，但稍早在臉書發文談及日前前往桃園角板山公園，韓國瑜表示，他每次來到原鄉部落，看見好多滿臉笑容的原民朋友，感覺都像是回到自己的家。為了原鄉精神，一定要全力協助原鄉地區把路打通、幫農產品找通路、為原鄉學子爭取更好的發展，這是未來新政府一定要做的事。
對於最近韓國瑜傾聽之旅行程都排很緊，但今天卻沒有行程，葉元之表示，韓國瑜每天公開、私下行程都非常多，只是有的行程適合公開，有的是私下拜會，不是說沒公開就沒行程，還是按照既定的步驟、方式在打選戰。（編輯：楊凱翔）1081103

Han powder live to provoke the DPP: interference with interview freedom will drive away from the police
03 Nov 2019, 20:54 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Ye Suping, Wang Chengzhong, Taipei, 3rd) The Kuomintang presidential candidate, the South Korean Yu supporters, went to the DPP to launch a campaign, and the live media issue area was provoked. The DPP said that it would shoot media work without consent, and directly referred to the reporters as ""1450"". The army is afraid of illegal law. In the future, it will drive away those who interfere with the freedom of news interviews, and even handle the police.
Ye Yuanzhi, a spokesman for the KMT’s presidential candidate, is appealing to the supporters of the camps to respect each other and hope that the media work will not be disturbed.
President Tsai Ing-wen yesterday made a stand for the legislator Zhang Honglu, and there was a live broadcast of the support for South Korea’s Yu to the media release area. The DPP Central Committee today stated through a statement that it would work for reporters without consent. The name is open to the public, directly referring to the reporter is the ""1450"" network army, the DPP expressed strong condemnation, this move not only does not respect people, interfere with the journalism profession, but also extremely lack of basic courtesy, and even violated the provisions of the Civil Law and Personal Data Protection Law Civil criminal responsibility.
In the future, the DPP will strengthen the rights and interests of journalists in the field. If they find unfriendly people, they will try to interfere with the freedom of news interviews, drive away the scene, and even handle the police. Regarding the ""1450"" network army, the DPP also categorically refuted it, saying that Facebook's live broadcast of publicly distributed false information has constituted a criminal law nuisance honour, and the relevant parties are self-respecting. The DPP does not rule out further legal action.
For the Korean Yu supporters live broadcast, Ye Yuanzhi said in a media interview today that he has to understand this matter. If there is such behavior, the reporter will feel very unpleasant and may interfere with the reporter’s interview, calling for no matter which one. Supporters of the camp, everyone should respect each other, avoid it and avoid it as much as possible. I hope that the media can work in an undisturbed environment.
Ye Yuanzhi pointed out that he had watched the live video of the Korean powder. The general public may not have contacted the media. He felt that he did not understand the process of media interviews, but he shot the reporter's computer screen and broadcasted it live. Privacy issues should be avoided.
South Korea’s Yu did not have a public trip today, but earlier in the Facebook issue, he went to Taoyuanjiao Banshan Park. South Korea’s Yu said that every time he came to the native tribe, he saw many smiling friends who were full of smiles. It is back to your own home. For the spirit of hometown, we must fully assist the original areas to open up roads, find agricultural products, and strive for better development for the native students. This is something the new government must do in the future.
For the recent travel tour of South Korea's Yu, it is very tight, but today there is no itinerary. Ye Yuanzhi said that there are many public and private trips in Korea every day, but some trips are suitable for publicity, and some are private meetings, not to say that they are not public. There is no itinerary, or in accordance with the established steps and methods in the election campaign. (Editor: Yang Kaixiang) 1081103
