      <p>(CNN) - Officials with the Illinois Association of Agricultural Fairs say that 2019 Miss Illinois County Fair Queen Alexi Bladel has not been relieved of her duties, despite reports to the contrary.</p>
      <p>However, in a statement on Twitter, the organization said "we have released her from any remaining obligations she would have as the reigning 2019 Miss Illinois County Fair Queen between now and January 2020. Alexi remains the Queen until her successor is named in January."</p>
      <p>Bladel also will retain all of her awards, gifts and benefits she has received for being queen.</p>
      <p>WIFR had reported that in September Bladel was notified she was being relieved of her remaining obligations as the reigning queen.</p>
      <p>She had previously enlisted with the U.S. Army Reserve, Illinois Rep. Joe Sosnowski told the station. But Bill Jennings, a spokesman for the pageant organization, told WIFR that her joining the Army had nothing to do with the decision.</p>
      <p>Jennings said the association made its decision based on events that happened prior to Bladel's enlistment.</p>
      <p>Bladel is the current Miss Winnebago County. She was crowned the 60th Miss Illinois County Fair Queen last January.</p>
