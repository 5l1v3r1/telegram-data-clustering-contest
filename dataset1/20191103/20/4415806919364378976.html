      <p>A bus travelling from Paris to London has crashed in northern France leaving 29 people injured, including five people with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>A FlixBus coach tipped over around 11am Irish Time after the incident on the A1 motorway in northern France today.</p>
      <p>The coach, operated by a regional partner for the German transport firm, was carrying 32 passengers when it tipped over in the rain and overturned in the Somme region, close to the village of Ablaincourt-Pressoir.</p>
      <p>FlixBus have said five people were seriously hurt and other passengers have been treated in local hospitals.</p>
      <p>Pictures of the incident show the bus on its side on a grass verge close to the road with a broken front windshield and a large hole in the front right side.</p>
      <p>According to local police, citizens of 10 nations were injured in the crash, including Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Two 20-year-olds from the North, Jamie Kerr and Gemma Given, were treated for head and hand injuries.</p>
      <p>Mr Kerr’s father John Kerr told the BBC the trip had been “a pretty traumatic end to a Halloween weekend”.</p>
      <p>He said the couple were offered a bus back to the UK but decided to make their own way home.</p>
      <p>“I feel a bit more could have been done for them,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They’ll learn a lot from all of this, but I’m expecting an emotional response when they get home and it all hits them.”</p>
      <p>Local police and firefighters attended the scene.</p>
