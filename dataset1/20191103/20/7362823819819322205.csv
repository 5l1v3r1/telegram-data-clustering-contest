Emma Bunton reveals she accidentally sent a sext to her mom — alongside a photo of her boobs.
The Spice Girl, 43, said the photo and racy text message were meant for her long-term partner Jade Jones, 40, who she was missing while on tour with the band over the summer.
But luckily her mother just made fun of her as the pair are such firm friends.

The singer explained on the pilot for the new Paul O'Grady show, according to The Mirror: ""I was away from my other half for a few days. But we are very much in love and I love sleeping next to him.
""We are together all the time. So I decided that I would send a mucky text. A cheeky text. A sext.
""I did a little selfie with the boobies. I did have a bra on. But I did a sleazy kind of little selfie and a 'Miss you' and 'Wish you...'  and sent it to my mother.""
