03 Nov 2019, 20:09

Dua Lipa turned heads with a daring outfit that showed off her suspenders at the MTV Europe Music Awards.
The New Rules singer looked sensational in the form-fitting black dress, complete with a leather corset worn on the outside and a risque thigh split that gave a glimpse of her suspenders.
The star wore her hair back in a tight bun.

As Lipa, who is performing her new single Don’t Start Now at the event, walked the carpet, members of the crowd – some holding banners – chanted her name.
She said: “I’m really, really excited. I feel like the nerves are really going to kick in the second I have done this and I get to the task of zoning in to my performance.
“I’m really, really looking forward to it.”
She said of her upcoming album: “It is quite nostalgic and has disco elements but I wanted to sound fresh and new.”
She added that she was “experimenting”.
Nicole Scherzinger was also among the stand-outs on the red carpet in Seville, Spain.
The former Pussycat Doll showed off her figure in a short, tight, sparkly red dress.
She wore her long dark hair loose over her shoulders and added simple heels to complete her look.

Halsey wore a floral mini-dress seemingly made up of different fabrics. The skirt was short, but had a long section hanging down to one of Halsey’s ankles.
