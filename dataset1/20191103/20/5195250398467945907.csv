The CR-V with 2-wheel-drive is offered with discounts worth Rs 4 lakh cash discount. Meanwhile, the 4-wheel-drive variant is being offered with a cash discount of Rs 5 lakh
For November, Honda is offering year-end offers on models including Amaze, Jazz, WR-V, City, BR-V, Civic and CR-V. Amidst an imminent slowdown in the industry that has led to a long spell of poor sales, a handful of manufacturers registered growth due to the festivities. However, Honda continued with the decline by witnessing a year-on-year decline of close to 29 per cent last month.
While the festivity sales have come to an end, the company is now offering year-end offers on the aforementioned models. On the Honda Amaze, buyers can exchange their old cars and get a warranty of 5 years in addition to the Rs 30,000 exchange bonus. Meanwhile, ones who are not looking to exchange can buy the Amaze with a 5-year warranty and a 3-year prepaid maintenance pack.



On the Jazz premium hatchback, the company is offering a cash discount of Rs 25,000 in addition to the Rs 25,000 exchange bonus. Similarly, on the WR-V compact SUV, Honda is offering a cash discount of Rs 25,000 alongside an exchange bonus worth Rs 20,000.
