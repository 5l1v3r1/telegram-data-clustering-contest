      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - Rhode Island's governor has unveiled a website that aims to provide parents with resources on early childhood education and development.</p>
      <p>Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says parents should turn to the revamped state website to learn about available state resources and guidance, from prenatal to pre-kindergarten.</p>
      <p>The enhancements to the website were paid for using a one-year federal preschool development grant. The entire grant provided about $4.2 million this year to strengthen Rhode Island's system, with other grant funds going to support the state's efforts to develop early childhood education and family-centered support programs.</p>
      <p>Raimondo says the grant "has laid important groundwork" as the state looks to continue increasing investments in early childhood education and development.</p>
      <p>She says every child, regardless of zip code, deserves a shot at a bright future.</p>
