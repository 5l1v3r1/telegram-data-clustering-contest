      <h1>Potential Ethereum Dip Provides Ideal Long Entry, Claims Analyst</h1>

      <p>Ethereum’s price has been slowly grinding lower over the past 24-hours which comes about as the asset sees an even further decline in its on-chain volume, and ETH is now at risk of breaking below a key short term support level, which could mean that a period of capitulation is imminent.</p>
      <p>In spite of this, one prominent analyst is noting that he believes that any potential price dip for both Ethereum and Bitcoin in the near-term could simply be a bear trap that provides traders and investors alike with an ideal long-entry.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Grinds Lower as it Nears Key Short-Term Support Level</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/11/buterin-in-beast-mode-as-work-on-ethereum-2-0-continues/">Ethereum</a> is trading down just under 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $182, which marks a notable drop from its 24-hour highs of $186 that were set yesterday.</p>
      <p>Ethereum’s downwards movement today comes concurrently with a similar movement by Bitcoin, which hit highs of $9,400 overnight before it began a short-term downtrend that has sent it to beneath $9,200.</p>
      <p>This bearishness today is simply an extension of the period of choppy trading that has been experienced by the aggregated <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/bitcoin-price-30-percent-rally-12000-analyst/">crypto markets</a> over the past several days and weeks, and Ethereum is currently caught in a trading range between $180 and $192, with the former price being a key support level that has held strong on multiple occasions over the past several weeks.</p>
      <p>ETH has also been facing declining trading volume over the past week, which has dropped even further today, with TokenAnalyst noting that it has plummeted by nearly 34% over the past 24-hours.</p>
      <blockquote>“4H #ETH Network Stats: Price: $183.54 (+0.9%). $ETH On-Chain Volume: $192M (-33.7%). Active Senders: 198K (-17.1%). Active Recipients: 87K (-6.3%),” they explained.</blockquote>

      <h3>Analyst: ETH Price Drop Could Provide Ideal Long Entry </h3>
      <p>Mayne, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes any near-term breakdown for both <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/regulated-eth-futures-not-so-fast">Ethereum</a> and Bitcoin could simply be a bear trap that is followed by a large movement upwards, which would mean that the next dip could be an ideal time to long the cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC and $ETH are consolidating. I think if we break down it’ll be a bear trap that you want to long. I expect bears to talk shit under all my bullish posts, sentiment will line up nicely. Same people talking shit are the ones who will be rebuying their spot back above $10k,” he explained while referencing the charts seen below.</blockquote>

      <p>The coming few hours and days will likely elucidate whether or not <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/22/ethereum-may-incur-large-drop-if-bulls-are-unable-to-defend-210/">Ethereum</a> and other cryptos will be able to break out of their recently established trading ranges, or if further consolidation is imminent.</p>
