      <h1>Trump praises UFC fighter Jorge Masvidal who called president a 'bad motherf-----' in video</h1>

      <p>President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">Trump</a> congratulated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ufc">UFC</a> fighter Jorge Masvidal on his victory over Nate Diaz in the octagon Saturday night, re-tweeting a video in which the mixed-martial artist called him a “bad motherf-----.”</p>
      <p>Trump had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cheered-and-booed-at-ufc-match-in-new-york-city">attended the UFC 244 bout Saturday night</a> at Madison Square Garden in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a>, watching as No. 3-ranked Masvidal improved his record to 35-13 on a technical knockout when a gash split open over Diaz’s right eye after the third round and a doctor called off the match.</p>

          <b>TRUMP CHEERED (AND BOOED) AT UFC MATCH IN NEW YORK CITY</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>“Great fight Champ!” Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1191001547901194242">wrote</a> Sunday morning on Twitter, retweeting a video of the American fighter in the days ahead of his bout with Diaz.</p>
      <p>The video clip showed Masvidal apparently speaking to a reporter about his thoughts on the president.</p>
      <p>“No matter what your views on Trump as a president, the guy’s a bad motherf-----, man — the money that he’s made, the obstacles that he’s conquered. He’s a bad motherf----- in his own way, you know, no matter what your political views are,” Masvidal said in the clip.</p>

      <p>In a second tweet, Trump likened the energy of his reception at the Garden to one of his Trump rallies.</p>
      <p>“Walking into Madison Square Garden last night with @danawhite for the big @UFC Championship fight was a little bit like walking into a Trump Rally,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1191007372673720321">wrote</a>. “Plenty of MAGA &amp; KAG present. Great energy. Fantastic job Dana! Heading to D.C. and then to Kentucky for a big @MattBevin Rally…”</p>

      <p>However, the type of reception that greeted Trump at the Garden has been a point of disagreement.</p>

      <p>USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ufc/2019/11/02/ufc-244-donald-trump-mixed-reaction-protesters-outside-msg/4143658002/">reported</a> Trump received a “mixed reception,” while a <a href="https://twitter.com/TaraLaRosa/status/1190837453696856065">video posted</a> by New Jersey mixed martial artist Tara LaRosa seemed to show a mostly favorable crowd for the president.</p>

      <p>Other Twitter users maintained Trump received more boos than cheers. However, Newsday of Long Island's Mark La Monica <a href="https://twitter.com/LaMonicaMark/status/1190810723364069380">tweeted</a> the reception was "nothing like at Nats game,” referring to Game 5 of the World Series last Sunday <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-roundly-booed-by-world-series-crowd-as-fans-yell-lock-him-up">where it seemed booing drowned out the cheers</a> for the president.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump Jr. disputed claims of a negative reception, <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1190833738676129792">writing</a> on Twitter that their entrance was “overwhelmingly positive,” and that UFC President Dana White called it “the most electrifying entrance” he’s seen in his 25 years in the business.</p>
      <p>Trump is set to try electrifying a Kentucky crowd at an election-eve rally Monday in Lexington on behalf of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s reelection bid.</p>
