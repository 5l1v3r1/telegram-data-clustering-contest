Jorge Masvidal may have had an anticlimactic win against Nate Diaz, but it doesn’t take away from his dominance at UFC 244.

“Gamebred” beat up Diaz on his way to an unpopular doctor’s stoppage win in Saturday’s main event for the “BMF” title. As the MMA world looks ahead to upcoming UFC pay-per-views, there has been discussion about which opponent Conor McGregor could face for his self-proclaimed January 18th return. At the post-fight press conference, Masvidal was asked about being a potential McGregor foe, and you just knew he wasn’t going to hold back.
“(He’s going to) come back to what? Like fighting in the cage? I don’t know man,” Masvidal said (via MMA Junkie). “That dude has been talking wild for a second. If he fights and gets a victory and he wants this – and some of you motherf—kers are mean because you know what the f—k I’ll do to that little dude, bro. I’ll f—k that little guy up man. He’s a f—king midget.”
“You see he punches old people in the face because those are fights he could win,” Masvidal continued. “He don’t want this sh-t. I don’t think Dana is going to promote that fight because you can’t get that guy to sign the paper.”
Of course, McGregor responded to Jorge’s remarks with a tweet that references Masvidal’s “three piece and a soda” line from earlier this year.



“Hey Burger King, could I get a 3 piece with soda and a side chicken box please? Loads of salt and vinegar. Thanks,” McGregor wrote.
There has been talk of McGregor facing Donald Cerrone, but Dana White insists nothing is signed at the moment.
