      <p>(MEXICO CITY) — Relatives of women and girls murdered or missing in Mexico demanded justice during a march through the capital on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The demonstration set out from the Independence Monument and headed for Mexico City’s sprawling main square to set up an offering near a massive altar erected to mark Dia de Muertos, or Day of the Dead.</p>
      <p>They carried purple crosses inscribed with the names of dozens of victims.</p>
      <p>Dia de Muertos is observed Nov. 1-2. The demonstration was billed as a “Dia de Muertas” march, or “Day of the Dead Women.”</p>
      <p>Nine women are killed daily in Mexico, according to the U.N.</p>
      <p>Organizer Frida Guerrero says protesters were demanding a “real interest” on the part of authorities to address killings of women.</p>
