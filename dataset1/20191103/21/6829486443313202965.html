      <p>Good morning, Angels! Your fave international women of mystery will be back on the big screen when <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> hits cinemas on November 14. To celebrate the release, we’re giving away a whole bunch of group passes so you and your BFFs can see the flick together.</p>
      <p>It is truly some of the best news of 2019 that absolute queen Elizabeth Banks (<i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>Pitch Perfect</i>) is bringing <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> back, with Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the next generation of Angels.</p>

      <p>In Banks’ revival of the iconic franchise, the mysterious Townsend Agency has expanded and there are now teams of Angels solving crimes and saving lives all over the world – and absolutely loving it.</p>
      <p>Banks wrote the screenplay and directed the film but, in an exceptional power move, she’s also starring as Bosley, running a covert group of the world’s smartest, bravest, and most highly-trained women.</p>

      <p>Her team of Angels – Stewart, Scott (2019’s <i>Aladdin</i>) and Balinska – will take down baddies, rock the hell out of some wigs, flirt with a cute scientist (played by heartthrob and perfect man Noah Centineo, <i>hello</i>), and perform synchronised dance routines.</p>
      <p>It’s honestly everything you could want from Hollywood, and we’re giving away a bunch of admit-four passes to see it in cinemas from November 14.</p>
      <p>All you have to do to be in with a chance to win is tell us, in 25 words or less, which kick-ass ladies you’d pick to be in your Charlie’s Angels team. Would it be your best mates, your mum, or Elizabeth Banks twice (good choice)?</p>
