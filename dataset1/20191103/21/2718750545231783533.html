      <h1>Incredible Synergy: Matthew Rhys’s Perry Mason Wears Same Hat As Perry the Platypus</h1>

      <p>Mr. Mason to his colleagues, Agent P to his friends. (We wish.) HBO has debuted the first look of its <a href="http://www.vulture.com/article/best-classic-tv-shows-streaming.html"><i>Perry Mason </i>limited-series reboot</a> starring <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/matthew-rhys-perry-mason-hbo.html">Matthew Rhys</a>, which finds our <a href="http://www.vulture.com/article/best-classic-tv-shows-streaming.html">pre–Raymond Burr</a> criminal-defense lawyer patrolling around 1931 Los Angeles as he investigates a “child kidnapping gone very, very wrong.” Perry, naturally, is thrilled at the thought of breaking the case of the decade, leading to a “relentless pursuit of the truth” and “a pathway to redemption for himself.” He also wears an incredible brown fedora that rivals his fellow Perry namesake, the platypus, from the hit children’s program <i>Phineas and Ferb, </i>which is a cute fact that we’ll couple with this crushing blow: Original <a href="http://www.vulture.com/article/best-classic-tv-shows-streaming.html"><i>Perry Mason </i>characters</a> Della Street, Paul Drake, and eternal loser Hamilton Burger won’t be appearing in the series. But really, take a look at that hat! The series will debut sometime in 2020.</p>
