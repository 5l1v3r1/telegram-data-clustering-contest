      <h1>Birth coach ‘hounded out' of profession by transgender activists for claiming only women can have babies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T21:17:48+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 21:17</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Pearce</a></address>
      <p>A birth coach in England resigned from Doula U.K., an industry charity, after the group reprimanded her for asserting that only women can give birth.</p>
      <p>Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert, 45, was the spokeswoman of Doula U.K. but has stepped down from the organization, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7643251/Charity-hounds-birth-coach-post-saying-women-children.html">according to</a> the Daily Mail. McCarthy-Calvert accused the charity of abandoning her over criticism from a small number of transgender activists offended by her social media post.</p>
      <p>"I am angry and sad," McCarthy-Calvert said on Monday. "I was effectively ostracized for saying I am a woman and so are my clients.</p>
      <p>"I have been very disappointed by Doula U.K.'s response. The leadership are paralyzed by not wanting to upset transgender rights activists," McCarthy-Calvert continued. "They have fallen over themselves to acquiesce to their demands."</p>
      <p>McCarthy-Calvert had written a Facebook post responding to a decision by Cancer Research U.K. to advertise cancer screenings as "relevant for everyone aged 25-64 with a cervix," consciously omitting the word "women" from campaign material.</p>
      <p>"I am not a 'cervix owner.' I am not a 'menstruator.' I am not a 'feeling.' I am not defined by wearing a dress and lipstick. I am a woman: an adult human female," McCarthy-Calvert wrote in response. "Women birth all the people, make up half the population, but less than a third of the seats in the House of Commons are occupied by us."</p>
      <p>A number of activists responded to McCarthy-Calvert's post accusing the birth coach of making offensive statements toward transgender people. Some asserted that being a woman is not necessary to become pregnant and have a child.</p>
      <p>Facing pressure from activists, Doula U.K. launched an investigation into their then-spokeswoman’s assertion that only women can have babies. After several months of investigating, the charity found that McCarthy-Calvert had made trans-exclusionary statements that broke Doula U.K.'s guidelines.</p>
      <p>Doula U.K. has <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1199547/trans-gender-news-activist-doula-birth-coach-feminist-women">denied</a> allegations that the charity pushed McCarthy-Calvert out of her position over her comments or that the board's ruling over her comments was driven by transgender activists.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to say that we seek to listen to the lived experience of marginalized groups and make changes – including changes to the language we use – if we believe it is necessary to make the Doula UK community more welcoming and supportive," Doula U.K. said in a statement.</p>
