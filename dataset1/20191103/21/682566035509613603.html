      <p>Paris - Canadian rising star <b>Denis Shapovalov</b> said he "wants to be beating guys" like <b>Novak Djokovic</b> and that "it doesn't stop here" after losing to the world number one in Sunday's Paris Masters final.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov failed to reproduce the form he had shown earlier in the week during wins over seeded players Fabio Fognini, Alexander Zverev and Gael Monfils as he fell to a 6-3, 6-4 defeat in his maiden Masters final.</p>
      <p>But the 20-year-old, who will break into the world's top 15 next week, vowed to come back stronger next year.</p>
      <p>"It's an unbelievable week for me, but it doesn't stop here," he said. "It's back to the court, back to practising.</p>
      <p>"I want to be beating guys like Novak so I have to improve, get better, find a way to return better against his serve. And hopefully I can do even better next year."</p>
      <p>Shapovalov, who started the week ranked 28th, has enjoyed a strong finish to a topsy-turvy season which featured his maiden ATP title in Stockholm a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>He is only the second Canadian man to reach a Masters final, after former Paris, Canadian Open and Indian Wells runner-up Milos Raonic.</p>
      <p>"It's a sport. There's going to be ups and downs. And it's not going to be finals of a Masters every week," added Shapovalov.</p>
      <p>"So it's normal to have some dips and rises. You know, I'm still learning about my game, too, improving every day."</p>
