RIYADH: The Saudi Human Rights Commission (HRC) has detailed plans for a new collaboration between the HRC and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the first of its kind in the MENA region. The collaboration was outlined at an event at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on Sunday.The event launched a workshop centered around two initiatives: The National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-up (NMRF) and the National Recommendations Tracking Database (NRTD). Both initiatives are within the framework of an MoU signed between the HRC and the OHCHR.The system will include descriptive information, statistical data and interactive maps. The database will make it possible to measure human rights progress in the Kingdom.President of the HRC Awwad Al-Awwad opened the event by highlighting the importance of the initiative, as well as drawing attention to Saudi Arabia being the first country to introduce such a venture.“Utilizing this database will help the HRC to track the implementation of recommendations of the international mechanisms in regards to human rights,” he said.UN Resident Coordinator in Saudi Arabia Nathalie Fustier congratulated Saudi Arabia on taking the initiative and working to improve human rights mechanisms in the country.“I am happy to see Saudi Arabia adopting an advanced approach to track recommendations emanating from different international human rights mechanisms. This is a step forward in advancing the link between the sustainable development goals and Saudi Vision 2030,” she said.
HIGHLIGHT
HRC will be working to enhance national capacities in the area of human rights, both within the Kingdom and outside of it. The process will involve the preparation, development and implementation of specialized training programs, including the mechanisms of the UN and international organizations.
