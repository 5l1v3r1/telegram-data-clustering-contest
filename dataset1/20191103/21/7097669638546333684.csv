PHOTOS: Jepkosgei wins NYC in 1st marathon, Kamworor takes men's
03 Nov 2019, 21:08 by Yahoo News Photo Staff
Joyciline Jepkosgei arrived in New York with a modest goal for her first marathon ever. Jepkosgei upset four-time champion Mary Keitany to win the New York City Marathon on Sunday with a historic debut seven seconds off the course record.
Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya won the men's event for the second time in three years. He pounced when defending champion Lelisa Desisa dropped out after seven miles, perhaps hurting following a grueling victory at the sweltering world championships last month. After pulling away from Kenyan countrymate Keitany with about three miles left, Jepkosgei crossed the finish line in Central Park in 2 hours, 22 minutes and 38 seconds, the second-best run in course history.
