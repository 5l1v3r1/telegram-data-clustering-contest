Max Verstappen congratulated Lewis Hamilton following the Brit winning his sixth world title with second place at the United States Grand Prix, before adding that he hopes he can give him a better run in 2020. Verstappen threatened to take P2 away from Hamilton in the closing laps but had to settle for third place, his seventh podium of the season.

Starting third on the grid, the Dutchman ran in second for most of the race, but a good strategy from Mercedes allowed Hamilton to get in front and he defended from P2, with the help of yellow flags at turn 12.



After the race, Verstappen told Sky Sports: ""We did the best we could, they were just a little bit faster today. It was a very good race and it was fun. I could still see the cars ahead of me and we had good pace today.

""The yellow flag on the back straight meant I couldn't use the DRS otherwise I think we could have been second. Still good to be on the podium.





""It's very impressive by Lewis. What else can you say. He's doing phenomenally, has a great team behind him and I hope we can take the fight to them next year.""
