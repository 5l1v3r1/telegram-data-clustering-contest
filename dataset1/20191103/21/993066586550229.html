      <p>John Malkovich declares himself to be “irresponsible, indolent, pompous and conceited” as the pontiff in the teaser trailer for The New Pope.</p>
      <p>The Sky Atlantic series picks up where The Young Pope left off, with Pius XIII, played by Jude Law, in a coma.</p>
      <p>Malkovich’s Sir John Brannox is chosen as his replacement and in the new footage from the show, he can be heard saying: “Everyone in the world should know who the Pope is. It’s not vanity, it’s necessity.”</p>

      <p>The trailer shows him riding in the “pope-mobile” and addressing crowds, as well as making confession and inquiring if there is any possibility if his predecessor could wake up.</p>
      <p>The trailer ends with a shot of Law’s finger moving, before he removes his breathing mask and smiles directly at the camera.</p>
      <p>The show, which is a co-production with HBO and Canal +, marks director Paolo Sorrentino’s second limited series in the world of the modern papacy.</p>
      <p>He had directed all nine episodes and wrote the show with Umberto Contarello and Stefano Bises.</p>
      <p>The series, which will feature Sharon Stone and Marilyn Manson as guest stars, will debut in January 2020 on Sky Atlantic and NOW TV.</p>
