      <h1>Only four per cent of thugs who attack frontline police are sent to prison</h1>
      <h2>Startling statistics emerge as police leaders estimate an assault on front line police happens every four minutes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T21:55:40+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">John Twomey</a></address>
      <p>Only 4% of recorded assaults on frontline police result in the perpetrator being jailed.</p>
      <p>Figures also show that just 36% of the attacks lead to a prosecution and 31% to a conviction.</p>
      <p>The startling statistics emerged as police leaders estimate an assault on front line bobbies happens every four minutes.</p>
      <p>Many say the justice system is failing to protect the battered thin blue line and called for more prosecutions and harsher sentences as a deterrent.</p>
      <p>Police Federation chairman John Apter said: “Far too often I hear of the Crown Prosecution Service dropping charges... Or when offenders are convicted, they get short or suspended sentences – often meaning they can walk smirking from court.”</p>

      <p>He said the message must be “if you assault an officer you will be jailed”.</p>
      <p>Official figures show there were 26,295 recorded assaults on constables in England and Wales in 2018, with 9,565 being prosecuted.</p>
      <p>Court figures reveal only 8,265 of those accused were convicted and 1,103 jailed.</p>
      <p>These are for assaults, not more serious attacks such as GBH.</p>
      <p>More than 1,500 were given either suspended prison sentences or conditional discharges.</p>
      <p>Community sentences were handed to 2,800 offenders. A total of 2,427 were fined.</p>
      <p>But there were only 280 cases where magistrates ordered attackers to pay compensation to the injured officers.</p>
      <p>A new law came into force this year doubling the maximum jail term for thugs who assault police and emergency workers to 12 months.</p>
      <p>Police say there are more than two million physical attacks on them every year but the vast majority are not reported.</p>
      <p>Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill, QC, has held talks with police chiefs to discuss their rising concern over the number of offenders charged with attacking police.</p>
      <p>Police Federation Chairman John Apter has been spat at, punched, kicked and knocked unconscious in the line of duty.</p>

      <p>He said: “As a society, we must make it absolutely clear we will not tolerate this type of behaviour, there must be a consequence.</p>
      <p>“But far too often I hear of the Crown Prosecution Service dropping charges against people who have attacked police officers. Or that when offenders are convicted, they get short or suspended sentences – often meaning they can walk smirking from court. “</p>
      <p>He added: “The message from the courts needs to be crystal clear, if you assault a police officer you will go to prison.</p>
      <p>The CPS said: “We will not hesitate to charge this disgraceful offence if our legal test is met.”</p>
      <p>It added the Director of Public Prosecutions has met police and “agreed a joint app­­­roach”, with “updated CPS guidance... being published shortly”.</p>

      <p>Sergeant Stevie Bull was answering a routine call to a hospital when she was confronted by a gunman who was threatening a nurse.</p>
      <p>Security men had gone to the wrong location during the incident at University College Hospital, central London, in March last year and Sgt Bull was on her own.</p>
      <p>The suspect had a large suitcase and she feared it might contain a bomb.</p>
      <p>According to her training, the officer 28, who won a Pride of Britain award, in partnership with TSB, should have backed away and waited for armed back-up.</p>
      <p>But retreat was not an option with the life of the nurse at stake.</p>
      <p>“I was so close to him that it was fight or flight mode and I went for him,” she said.</p>
      <p>Sgt Bull, who was a PC at the time, suffered head and neck injuries in the struggle.</p>
      <p>She said: “I didn’t think about my own personal safety. I just acted on instinct.” She pinned the gunman to the ground and managed to handcuff him after security officers dashed to the scene of the commotion.</p>

      <p>Also PC Stuart Outten was branded Britain’s hardest copper after he Tasered a suspect despite being stabbed with a machete.</p>
      <p>He was struck across the head and hand with the foot-long weapon after stopping a van in Leyton, east London, to check the driver’s insurance details.</p>
      <p>The officer, 29, brushed aside the accolade and praise.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been looking after Londoners for the past 10 years and I’m going back out doing it all again.”</p>
      <p>A man has been charged with attempted murder and possessing an offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile attacks are contributing to record numbers of police on sick leave for mental health reasons.</p>
      <p>More than 10,500 officers took time off work last year suffering from stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>The figure represents a 70% surge over the past five years as the effects of being attacked or witnessing colleagues being beaten or stabbed take their toll.</p>
      <p>Police Federation boss John Apter said: “It is not surprising that more and more need to take time away from the frontline.”</p>
