After 60 minutes of action, the tie remained scoreless meaning it was going to take a penalty shootout to decide who was going forward to compete at Tokyo 2020.

Goalkeeper Ayeisha McFerran proved to be the hero once again, stepping up to save two penalties either side of Beth Barr’s goal. McFerran’s second save kept Ireland in the tie while Chloe Watkins forced sudden death.
In sudden death, up stepped Upton to atone for her earlier miss by sending Ireland through to next year’s games. The Donnybrook crowd went wild as this truly special team continue to make memories for all Irish sports fans.
