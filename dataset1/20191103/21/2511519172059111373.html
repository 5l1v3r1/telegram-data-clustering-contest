What a risky defence from the champion who's determined hold on. There's going to be a few more of those duels though before this race is done though.</p>

        <h3>What time does the race start?</h3>
        <p>The race begins at 7:10pm (BST) on Sunday evening.</p>
        <h3>How can I watch?</h3>
        <p>The race will be aired live on Sky Sports F1, with their coverage beginning at 5.30pm. Sky Sports subscribers can watch via the Sky Go app, or on the website.</p>
        <p>Highlights can be seen on Channel 4 at 11pm, or on demand via All 4.</p>
        <h3>Who is on pole?</h3>
        <p>Valtteri Bottas took a narrow pole, beating Sebastian Vettel by just 0.012 seconds to push the Ferrari driver into second.</p>
        <p>Max Verstappen will start third, with Lewis Hamilton recording the fifth-best time as he seeks to seal another Drivers’ Championship.</p>
        <h3>What does Lewis Hamilton need to win the Drivers’ Championship?</h3>
        <p>Hamilton is poised to seal a third consecutive title this weekend, with Bottas only able to continue the championship race by winning in Austin.</p>
        <p>Should Bottas win and secure the bonus point for the fast lap, Hamilton would have to finish eighth or better to secure the Drivers’ Championship. If Hamilton records the fastest lap, ninth place would suffice for the British driver.</p>
        <h3>What Hamilton has said...</h3>
        <p>“I don’t look at this race as a particularly important,” the 34-year-old said. “It’s as important as any other race to me. It is not a stand-out, individual, important race for me. There are still two more after that.</p>
        <p>“I will approach it exactly the same. I’m not looking to perform miracles. Things happen for a reason and today is a lesson learnt. Try to see if I can turn a negative into a positive tomorrow.”</p>
        <p>“It has been the same pressure every year. [The circumstances] are always different. We had Brazil [2008] last corner, last race in Abu Dhabi with double points for a win [in 2014], multiple races left [in 2015, ‘17, and ‘18]. It doesn’t make a massive difference. The pressure feels similar and I am not someone who pressure gets to.”</p>
        <h3>What Bottas has said...</h3>
        <p>“He is leading the championship with quite a big margin and he doesn’t need many points to do it. I’m sure he would like to win the championship in a good way but I will try my best to delay that and focus on my race rather than anyone else’s.”</p>
