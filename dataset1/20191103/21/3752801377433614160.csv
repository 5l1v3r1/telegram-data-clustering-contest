""To facilitate a fair placement process, the above criteria are strictly adhered to without fail.

Parents should therefore accept placement offered by the department as these cannot be changed,"" Mabona said.
Parents are urged to log on to the system however, if they do not have access to the internet they may visit the nearest district office for assistance.
""Parents should rest assured that the department is obliged to place all learners, and as such all learners will be placed, however, it might not be at schools that they want. It must be noted that schools are making every effort to accommodate all in line with admissions regulations.
""We are aware that some of our officials were assaulted, equipment and buildings vandalised. We wish to call upon parents to be calm and not use violence at our offices,"" said Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi.
