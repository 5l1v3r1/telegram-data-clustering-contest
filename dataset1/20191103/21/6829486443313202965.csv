Tell Us Who Your Angels Would Be & You Could Take Them To See ‘Charlie’s Angels’ On Us
03 Nov 2019, 21:00 by Junkee
Good morning, Angels! Your fave international women of mystery will be back on the big screen when Charlie’s Angels hits cinemas on November 14. To celebrate the release, we’re giving away a whole bunch of group passes so you and your BFFs can see the flick together.
It is truly some of the best news of 2019 that absolute queen Elizabeth Banks (The Hunger Games, Pitch Perfect) is bringing Charlie’s Angels back, with Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as the next generation of Angels.



In Banks’ revival of the iconic franchise, the mysterious Townsend Agency has expanded and there are now teams of Angels solving crimes and saving lives all over the world – and absolutely loving it.
Banks wrote the screenplay and directed the film but, in an exceptional power move, she’s also starring as Bosley, running a covert group of the world’s smartest, bravest, and most highly-trained women.



Her team of Angels – Stewart, Scott (2019’s Aladdin) and Balinska – will take down baddies, rock the hell out of some wigs, flirt with a cute scientist (played by heartthrob and perfect man Noah Centineo, hello), and perform synchronised dance routines.
It’s honestly everything you could want from Hollywood, and we’re giving away a bunch of admit-four passes to see it in cinemas from November 14.
All you have to do to be in with a chance to win is tell us, in 25 words or less, which kick-ass ladies you’d pick to be in your Charlie’s Angels team. Would it be your best mates, your mum, or Elizabeth Banks twice (good choice)?
