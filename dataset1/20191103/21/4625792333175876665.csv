Poll: Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in dead heat in hypothetical matchup
03 Nov 2019, 21:42 by John Gage
A hypothetical matchup between Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary race showed the two nearly tied for the nomination.
The poll done by Harvard Harris found that 19% of people would support Biden with 18% supporting Clinton.
Without Clinton in the race, the poll found the former vice president pulling in 33% support from Democrats. However, nearly half of his supporters would jump ship to back Clinton if she were to enter the race.
Clinton has helped fuel speculation of a potential run and is currently doing a book tour for her latest book, The Book of Gutsy Women, which she coauthored with her daughter Chelsea Clinton.
In an interview last month, the former secretary of state told a PBS reporter, ""Maybe there does need to be a rematch"" with President Trump.
The former Democratic nominee lost to Trump in the 2016 election. It would be her third attempt at the presidency if she ran again.
