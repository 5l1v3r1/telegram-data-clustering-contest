The Brazilians needed penalties to defeat to Chippa United for a spot in the Telkom Knockout semi-finals, where they will travel to Golden Arrows.
Sirino kept Sundowns in the game after netting brace, but Pitso Mosimane reveals the Uruguayan picked up a knock after explaining why Mauricio Affonso played the full game.
""He [Affonso] had to play, he couldn't finish the match because I had forced substitutes, Gaston [Sirino] got injured, an important player for us, Phakamani [Mahlambi] got injured, an important player for us.
""Themba Zwane is injured, an important player for us, fortunately we have Denis [Onyango] back and that's Denis for you.""
Before Sundowns were drawn against Arrows, Mosimane claims it's vital to claim victory in the final four.
""You know when you go to the semi-finals, it's always better to win it or go to the final because we're adding another game on the games in hand that we have and it leads you on and you don't win it, you must win it! Otherwise it's not worth it.""
