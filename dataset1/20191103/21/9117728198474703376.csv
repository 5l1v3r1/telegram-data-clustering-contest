03 Nov 2019, 21:31 by Adam Newton

2016 F1 world champion Nico Rosberg has sent his congratulations to Lewis Hamilton following the Brit's sixth world title in 2019 as he took second place to make it mathematically impossible for teammate Valtteri Bottas to overtake him in the standings.

Hamilton and Bottas shared an intense rivalry during their four years as teammates, which saw two titles for Hamilton and one for Rosberg, with the German retiring days after his championship.



Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Bottas said: ""A big congratulations to Lewis.

""We saw all of Lewis' class out there today. He took the strategy into his own hands and maybe did a better strategy than the team was recommending him and almost got that win.





""It was a phenomenal attempt to try and get that win. He really did fantastically, lost out a little bit to Valtteri but a completely deserved sixth title in amazing fashion.""
