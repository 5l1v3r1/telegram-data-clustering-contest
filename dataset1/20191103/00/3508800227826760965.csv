擬定適合自己的菜單：你想練壯、緊實還是培養運動習慣？
03 Nov 2019, 00:46 by Gymirin 的 Calvin


我們想讓你知道的是如何讓自己跳脫新手、找到合適的訓練方法？首先，設定自己健身訓練目標：你想練壯 、想練緊實，還是培養運動習慣？



每個人都當過健身房新手，但你要當多久的新手呢？
以我在健身房的觀察，有些人繳了四、五年會費、教練課也買了快100堂，但還是一個新手。反觀有些人進健身房大概半年，沒有請教練，看起來卻很像老鳥。
新手不可怕，可怕的是，花了很多時間運動，卻沒有進步、還不小心受傷。
如何讓自己跳脫新手、找到合適的訓練方法？首先，設定自己健身訓練目標：

想練壯
想練緊實
培養運動習慣

再來，要擬定自己的訓練菜單：

Step1. 確定訓練部位
Step2. 確定訓練器材或動作
Step3. 每一器材或動作的組數、阻力、次數

建議大家，每一次完成一個動作或器材的練習，要大概記錄自己的狀態，如：阻力、次數、組數及肌肉狀態。每一次的紀錄，都是幫助我們更了解自己是否有進步。
最後，要記得在運動前後進行伸展運動，確保肌肉彈性、減少受傷。
根據目標，一起來擬定適合自己的菜單。
想練壯的人
建議每一次安排的訓練部位，以主動肌＋拮抗肌的搭配，建議：一週訓練三次，

第一次：胸＋背
第二次：二頭＋三頭
第三次：股四頭（大腿前側）＋腿後側

決定部位後，找到對應的訓練動作，要先測試自己的阻力。最常見的測試方法為「看你最重可以多重」，也就是找到自己的1RM。例如：今天要練習二頭，二頭彎舉我30kg我可以做五下，但40kg我只能做一下，那我的1RM在二頭彎舉這個動作就是40kg。
測試阻力後，要設定每次練習的組數跟阻力，阻力建議從75－85％ 1RM開始，所以二頭彎舉我會從30kg或35kg開始訓練，一組8－12下，一個動作4組。

進階訓練

訓練1－3週後，可以嘗試提高重量或限制自己每一個動作需要的「時間」，也可以說是「節奏」。根據NASM的建議，想要練壯，一個動作4秒（離心、向心各兩秒）。簡言之，就是一個動作收縮兩秒、伸展兩秒。組間的休息建議1－3分鐘。

想練緊實
緊實的訓練方法，可以思考成「減脂」的訓練方法，要以有氧＋無氧運動一起訓練。我這邊要來介紹效果最好的運動方法，一個大肌群一週訓練兩次，所以我會建議一週要去健身房六次。這六次可以選擇兩種訓練：
訓練一：適合身材適中、想要減脂者

第一、四次：胸＋三頭
第二、五次：背＋二頭
第三、六次：肩腿＋腹肌

訓練二：適合身材偏重、想要減重者

第一次：胸＋三頭
第三次：背＋二頭
第五次：肩腿＋腹肌
第二、四、六次：進行30分鐘有氧或15分鐘HIIT訓練

想要練緊實，在NASM中建議的阻力設定為50－70％ 1RM，一個動作訓練四組，一組15－20下，組間休息30－60秒。跟練壯不同之處，在於相對低的阻力，但更多的次數、更短的組間休息。

進階訓練

訓練2－3週後，可以開始控制運動的節奏，一下動作建議為七秒（速度分配：離心動作四秒、頂峰收縮兩秒、向心收縮一秒）。

想培養運動習慣
說到培養運動習慣、養成運動的感覺，在健身房中，比較常出沒在有氧教室或飛輪教室。有氧課程的訓練目標，以40分鐘內可以有效的讓身體各部位都有運動到、讓心跳可以維持在140下左右，身體爆汗，感覺到自己活著真好。
若如果想要用重訓達到類似的效果呢？那就是把有氧課程的動作跟邏輯拆解到健身訓練中，菜單的安排可以使用「大肌群跑一圈」的方法，即一次健身練6個動作，胸、背、肩、腿、腹、臂，一週至健身房3次。阻力設定為50－70％ 1RM，每一個動作4－6組，一組8－12下組間休息30－60秒。

重訓沒有絕對，只有適不適合
以上三種方法，其實並沒有絕對的對或錯，如果不知道3種應該使用哪一種比較好，或許可以嘗試執行一個月一種方法，每天測量體重、拍體態照，觀察自己的變化，找到適合自己的運動菜單。
如果，你已經開始嘗試安排自己的菜單，想要找人給你一些建議，歡迎加入我的IG：Gymirin，我們可以一起討論菜單（我也會分享我的菜單在上面）。最後，要記得，運動前、後都要記得伸展唷。

Develop a menu that suits you: Do you want to train, tighten or develop your exercise habits?
03 Nov 2019, 00:46 by Calvin of Gymirin


What we want you to know is how to get rid of newbies and find the right training method? First, set your own fitness training goals: Do you want to practice strong, want to practice tight, or cultivate exercise habits?



Everyone has been a newcomer to the gym, but how long do you have to be a newbie?
In my observation at the gym, some people paid four or five years of membership fees, and the coaching class also bought 100 classes, but it was still a newbie. On the other hand, some people entered the gym for about half a year, did not ask the coach, it looks like a veteran.
The novice is not terrible. The terrible thing is that it took a lot of time to exercise, but it didn't progress and was accidentally injured.
How to get rid of newbies and find the right training method? First, set your own fitness training goals:

Want to train
Want to practice tight
Develop exercise habits

Come again, draw up your own training menu:

Step1. Determine the training site
Step2. Determine training equipment or actions
Step3. The number, resistance, and number of times of each equipment or action

It is recommended that every time you complete an exercise or equipment exercise, you should roughly record your status, such as resistance, number of times, number of groups, and muscle status. Every record is to help us better understand whether we have made progress.
Finally, remember to stretch before and after exercise to ensure muscle elasticity and reduce injuries.
According to the goal, work together to develop a menu that suits you.
Who wants to be strong
It is recommended that each training session be arranged with active muscle + antagonistic muscle. It is recommended to train three times a week.

First time: chest + back
Second time: two heads + three heads
Third time: four heads (front side of the thigh) + back side of the leg

After determining the location, find the corresponding training action, you must first test your resistance. The most common test method is to ""see if you are the most important and can be multiple"", that is, find your own 1RM. For example: I have to practice two heads today, I can do five 30kg for two bends, but I can only do it for 40kg, then my 1RM is 40kg in the two corners.
After testing the resistance, set the number of groups and resistance for each exercise. The resistance is recommended to start from 75-85% 1RM, so I will start training from 30kg or 35kg in two bends, one set 8-12, one action 4 sets. .

Advanced training

After 1-3 weeks of training, you can try to increase the weight or limit the ""time"" required for each action, or ""Rhythm"". According to NASM's suggestion, I want to train and exercise for 4 seconds (centrifugation and centripetal for two seconds). In short, an action is contracted for two seconds and stretched for two seconds. Rest between groups is recommended for 1-3 minutes.

Want to practice tight
Tight training methods can be considered as a ""fat reduction"" training method, training with aerobic + anaerobic exercise. I want to introduce the best exercise method here. A large muscle group trains twice a week, so I would recommend going to the gym six times a week. These two trainings are available for these six times:
Training 1: Suitable for those who are moderately fit and want to lose fat

First, fourth: chest + three heads
Second, fifth: back + two
Third, sixth: shoulder + abdominal muscles

Training 2: Suitable for those who are heavy and want to lose weight

First time: chest + three heads
Third time: back + two heads
Fifth time: shoulder + abdominal muscles
Second, fourth, and sixth: 30 minutes of aerobic or 15-minute HIIT training

Want to practice tight, the recommended resistance in NASM is set to 50-70% 1RM, one action training four groups, one group 15-20 times, group break 30-60 seconds. The difference between being strong and strong is the relatively low resistance, but more times and shorter breaks between groups.

Advanced training

After 2-3 weeks of training, you can start to control the rhythm of the movement. The recommended action is seven seconds (speed allocation: four seconds of centrifugation, two seconds of peak contraction, and one second of centripetal contraction).

Want to develop exercise habits
When it comes to cultivating exercise habits and developing a sense of exercise, in the gym, it is more common in aerobic classrooms or flywheel classrooms. The training goal of the aerobic course can effectively move all parts of the body to 40 minutes, so that the heartbeat can be maintained at around 140, and the body is sweating, feeling that it is good to live.
If you want to use retraining to achieve a similar effect? That is to disassemble the action and logic of the aerobic course into fitness training. The menu arrangement can use the method of “running a large muscle group”, that is, 6 exercises in one exercise, chest, back, shoulders, legs, and abdomen. Arms, 3 times a week to the gym. The resistance is set to 50-70% 1RM, each action is 4-6 sets, and a set of 8-12 lower sets rest between 30-60 seconds.

Heavy training is not absolute, only suitable
The above three methods, in fact, there is no absolute right or wrong, if you do not know which one should be used, it may be possible to try to implement a method for one month, measure the weight, take a picture of the body, observe your own changes, find a suitable one. Sports menu.
If you've started trying to arrange your own menu and want to find someone to give you some advice, welcome to join my IG:Gymirin, we can discuss the menu together (I will also share my menu above). Finally, remember to remember to stretch before and after the exercise.
