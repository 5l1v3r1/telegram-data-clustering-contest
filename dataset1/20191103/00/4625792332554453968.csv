03 Nov 2019, 00:43 by Jon Brown
The Belgian Malinois credited with frightening ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi into detonating his suicide vest is not eligible for a Purple Heart despite his injuries, much to the chagrin of some veteran advocates.
The valiant canine named Conan is reportedly slated to visit President Trump at the White House next week for his role in killing one of the world's leading terrorists. Conan is reportedly a veteran of more than 50 missions. A spokeswoman for the Department of Defense nevertheless told the New York Post that ""military working dogs are not eligible for the Purple Heart.""

Former Army Ranger Michael Bollinger, 26, told the New York Post, ""Do I believe Conan should receive a Purple Heart for actions on target? Absolutely. They’re out there with us every step of the way.”
Other veterans are reportedly outraged that Conan will not be receiving the medal, including Kit Sawyer, 30, a sergeant who holds fond memories of being a dog handler in the Army's 75th Ranger regiment. ""He’s definitely saved lives,"" Sawyer said of his Dutch Shepherd, Roy.
A dog named Chips received a Silver Star in 1943 for his valiant service in World War II and was also nominated for a Distinguished Service Cross and a Purple Heart for wounds he received in Italy. The practice has since been discontinued because some considered giving war medals to dogs as disrespectful to the soldiers who earned them. ""They made a fuss,"" said the mother of Chips' owner, John. ""John's mother reacted by telling reporters that Chips would probably like a pound of hamburger more than a medal, anyway,"" the Washington Post reported.
Trump took flak from some journalists on social media this week after sharing a Daily Wire meme that depicted him bestowing on Conan the Medal of Honor. James McCloughan, the Purple Heart recipient whose head was replaced with Conan's in the meme, was not offended, according to those who interviewed him. ""I’m not offended by another hero,"" McCloughan said.
