      <h1>How To Avoid The Worst Consumer Scams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John F. Wasik</a></address>
      <p>I hate getting scammed, especially when I don't <i>think</i> I'm getting scammed.Since I've been writing about fraud for decades, it burns my toast when I don't see a swindle coming. Case in point: My wife and I recently got burned by a "craftsman" offering to do home improvements.</p>
      <p>We needed a few simple things done: Fix and paint a rotting fence and install some trim in a bedroom. We figured he'd been in and out in a week or so.</p>
      <p>These minor projects lasted most of the summer. Since he was a neighbor and always bemoaning his financial situation — "I'm going to lose my home" — we cut him some slack when we should have cut him loose. He would do 10 minutes worth of shoddy work, then turn up a week later. Seemingly manageable jobs were being billed by the hour.</p>
      <p>I know. We probably should have turned off our sympathy meter and hired a licensed contractor. We were hoodwinked and should've known better. We're weren't alone, if that's any consolation, according to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), which recently compiled its<a href="https://consumerfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Top-Consumer-Complaints-Report.pdf"> top-10 consumer scam list. </a></p>
      <p>The CFA surveyed leading consumer protection agency and scammed more than 1 million complaints. Here's what they found:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Auto: </b>Misrepresentations in advertising or sales of new and used cars, lemons, faulty repairs, auto leasing, rentals, and towing disputes.</li>
        <li><b>Home Improvement/Construction: </b>Shoddy work, failure to start or complete the job.</li>
        <li><b>Retail Sales:</b> False advertising and other deceptive practices, defective merchandise, problems with rebates, coupons, gift cards and gift certificates, failure to deliver.</li>
        <li><b>Services:</b> Misrepresentations, shoddy work, failure to have required licenses, failure to perform.</li>
        <li><b>(Tie) Landlord/Tenant:</b> Unhealthy or unsafe conditions, failure to make repairs or provide promised amenities, deposit and rent disputes, illegal eviction tactics; <b>Utilities:</b> Complaints about gas, electric, water and cable billing and service.</li>
        <li><b>Health Products/Services:</b><i> </i>Misleading claims, unlicensed practitioners, failure to deliver, medical billing issues.</li>
        <li><b>(Tie) Credit/Debt: </b>Billing and fee disputes, mortgage modifications and mortgage-related fraud, credit repair, debt relief services, predatory lending, illegal or abusive debt collection tactics; <b>Communications: </b>Misleading offers, installation issues, service problems, billing disputes with telephone and internet services.</li>
        <li><b>Internet Sales:</b> Misrepresentations or other deceptive practices, failure to deliver online purchases.</li>
        <li><b>Home Solicitations:</b> Misrepresentations, abusive sales practices, and failure to deliver in door-to-door, telemarketing or mail solicitations, do-not-call violations.</li>
        <li><b>(Tie) Household Goods:</b> Misrepresentations, failure to deliver, faulty repairs in connection with furniture or appliances; <b>Fraud: </b>Bogus sweepstakes and lotteries, work-at-home schemes, grant offers, fake check scams, imposter scams and other common frauds.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The most basic defense is to get these services in writing, use a credit card and don't sign up for something that's too good to be true. As with our faux home contractor, you can pay a fortune and not get the service you need.</p>
