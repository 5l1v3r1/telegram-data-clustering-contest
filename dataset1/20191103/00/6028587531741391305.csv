Apple Black Friday Accessories Deals

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation) - $120 (save $9) - shop deal now
Apple Magic Mouse 2 (Wireless, Rechargable) - Silver - $69 (save $10) - shop deal now

For me, the standout deals here are the 256GB iPhone XS because, although it is one year old, it’s $400 less than a 256GB iPhone 11 Pro. Amazon’s iPhone 6S is also an incredible deal for a cheap/backup phone and the store’s iPad Pro deal is likely one of the biggest savings you’ll see this holiday season because it’s such a new device. Pay attention to Walmart’s 6th gen iPad deal, this is a rock-solid device. 
Seeing B&H discount the latest MacBook Pros along with the red hot Apple Watch Series 5 is a big surprise, I expected no discounts this year and Amazon’s AirPods deals should be as good as anything you find on Black Friday itself (with more stock now too). 
For my dedicated store-by-store, Black Friday live deals guides you can check out available Amazon deals here, available Best Buy deals here and available Walmart deals here. While Black Friday 2019 shipping policies can be found for Amazon (here), Best Buy (here), Target (here) and Walmart (here).
