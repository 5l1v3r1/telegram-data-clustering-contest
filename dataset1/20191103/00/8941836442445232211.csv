High-profile attorney in New Mexico arrested for 2nd DWI

03 Nov 2019

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A high-profile defense attorney in New Mexico is facing his second drunken driving charge this year.
David Serna was arrested Saturday in Albuquerque after police said he crashed his Mini Cooper into another car.
According to a criminal complaint, the 66-year-old Serna admitted to having a beer an hour and a half before the accident after telling police he hadn’t been drinking. Court documents also say Serna told authorities he had taken nerve pain medication and oxycodone earlier in the day.
Police say a breathalyzer test showed Serna had a blood alcohol content of 0.16 - twice the legal limit in New Mexico.
Serna was arrested and charged with aggravated drunken driving. Serna did not immediately respond to a phone message.



His latest arrest comes months after prosecutors dropped another drunken driving case.
