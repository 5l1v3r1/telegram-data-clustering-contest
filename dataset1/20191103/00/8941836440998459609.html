      <p>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) - A Missouri woman is facing two felony charges in connection with a crash in May that killed an 11-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>The Springfield News-Leader reports the 18-year-old woman was charged last week with involuntary manslaughter and assault. The crash happened on May 13 on Highway 65 in Springfield.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the woman rear-ended a Chevrolet Cruze with her Dodge Durango while driving northbound. The impact caused the Chevrolet to go off the road and hit a guardrail.</p>
      <p>The 11-year-old passenger in the Chevrolet died and another person in the car sustained serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Court documents say the woman told police she had been adjusting bags on the passenger side of the car just before the crash. Prosecutors say data from the woman’s SUV shows she was driving 81 mph.</p>
