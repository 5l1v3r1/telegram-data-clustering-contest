《泰國》：塔克辛想「輸出」民主到北京，反而被「輸入」威權資本主義
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是據早年團隊成員沙勒辛所述：「塔克辛十分明確：『我要用民主當作達成我目標的手段』，而那就是威權主義。」意在增加政府部門力量的一九九七年憲法助了塔克辛一臂之力，他宣布憲法裡抑制與平衡的「基礎架構」無效。在二○○五年的連任競選宣傳時，他批評民主妨礙了「人民的工作」。



文：班傑明・札瓦基（Benjamin Zawacki）
據歷史學者大衛・瓦厄特（David K. Wyatt）所述，一九五○年代晚期的陸軍元帥沙立「殘忍、貪婪、武斷且獨裁。他使議會民主制與人權倒退，他讓泰國的國際地位掛勾在明亮耀眼的美國星星上，他抵押了國家的未來」。塔克辛轉向中國比沙立傾向美國來得審慎，而且中國對泰國的地緣政治利益較無需動用其保護力量。但是北京愈發強烈地影響塔克辛治下的人權。塔克辛的內政部長滿意地回想中國「從未、從未、從未」評論泰國南部事務，不過從二○○四年開始，泰方確實與中方討論其內部安全事務。
主管中國新疆維吾爾自治區的指揮官曾跟泰國國防部長會面。維吾爾人與多數泰國南部人皆擁有伊斯蘭認同，抗拒北京主導權的人們則被視為「恐怖分子」。塔克辛也對上海合作組織的反恐作為有興趣，組織由中國運作且排除美國。對於北京視為國安威脅的「分裂主義分子」，塔克辛依循北京的利益行動。駐泰的中國媒體，獲准刊出合乎北京的新疆和西藏政策下的一切政令宣傳，而在二○○四年中國贊助泰國記者赴西藏後，類似報導也在泰國國內報紙刊出。隔年塔克辛推翻川的決定、依循中國要求，拒絕達賴喇嘛入境。「我們可以在文化與宗教方面跟達賴喇嘛建立關係，而非以國家或政府領袖的身分。」
二○○一年四月，來自兩國的壓力迫使法輪功取消在曼谷的會議。塔克辛起初重申川的論點、援引允許和平表達信仰的國內法，但隨後下令集會不能用作批評中國的論壇。泰華群體展現出僅僅在川下台兩年間的政治觀點轉變，發言支持強硬手段。泰國的警察總監明確表示：「我們想跟中國保持良好關係。」同樣地，在二○○三年亞太經合會前將法輪功信眾驅逐出城，也直接來自於北京的壓力。然而在美國大使館看來，「此刻並無理由認為泰方會反對美國重新安置法輪功案例」，對此美方於二○○五年緊急著手處理。用塔克辛的話來說：「我們合作，但是我們從未將他們驅逐出境，因為他們並未真正觸犯任何罪行。也許他們持有一些不同的意識型態，但我們只是阻止他們的活動，說：『請不要這麼做，我們不想傷害跟中國的關係，別這麼做』，他們說好。但是我們從未把他們趕回中國。」
可是他們把其他人趕回去，亦即美國在一場政治角力戰裡輸掉的中國異議分子。在塔克辛治下美方維持稍偏邊緣的地位，不過新近發展是中國甚至在此議題上展示力量，且於接下來幾年獲取優勢。二○○一年，中國要求泰國調查一個宣稱要炸掉中國大使館的人。泰方並未發現特定主張的證據，卻說他們找到一封此人寫給台灣國防部長的信，內容關於攻打中國。由於缺乏起訴的根據，泰國因而將他驅逐出境並禁止再入境，此人立即在中國遭到監禁。一位美國參議員向泰方施壓，要求得知更多資訊，甚至連「曼谷的中共官員都主動逼迫」他們——通常藉由現金匯款。一位官員告訴美方，他「不想自己或泰國皇家警察（Royal Thai Police）成為其他國家政治事項的工具」，不過事實正是如此。
然而在二○○四年，人權二度取勝。首先，素拉基亞要求聯合國評估一位中國知名異議人士的庇護要求，美國隨即在七天內重新安置他。第二，一支中國搖滾樂團的兩位成員在親台灣的表演後抵泰，「中國高階官員隨即於總理塔克辛訪中期間，要求將兩人遣返中國。」雖然塔克辛下達逮捕令，在他們迅速潛逃至柬埔寨、取得瑞典官員的保護時，當局卻視而不見。美國外交官的插手程度不明。聯合國也有至少一百位較不著名中國人尋求庇護的紀錄，其中有些得以重新安置至美國或他處。用塔克辛的話來說：「我們從來不想遣返女人或兒童，我們必須謹慎行事。」
在遣返與重新安置之間，尚有非自願逐離國界。在「中方向他們施壓」後，泰國當局於二○○五年逼迫一位異議人士接受逐離，向他保證中泰雙方皆不會干預他低調地重新入境泰國。儘管不願接受，他仍然遭到驅逐。另一位異議人士被逮捕的消息出現在美國網站上時，泰國拒絕在沒有官方引渡請求下遣返他，卻允許中國官員在他受拘留時訪視。泰方告知美方他們試著要平衡人道考量、政策延續性，以及與北京的關係，隨後泰方逼迫這位異議人士接受逐離。他們也主張自己不能被視為「美國要求什麼就去做」。異議人士同樣拒絕接受提議，可是仍然遭到逐離。這使得塔克辛的結論與紀錄並非全然一致：「我們只遣返真正觸犯嚴重罪行的人——不像反恐戰爭，而且並非出於意識型態差異。」
中國模式
塔克辛在當選的四個月後表示泰國不會干預鄰國：「但是我們將說服他們民主比較好，因為我們現在正在享用民主的佳餚……與其試圖強迫他們改變飲食習慣，我們可以說服他們品嘗一點民主。」在二○○六年政變的六個月前，塔克辛思想的擁護者潘薩告訴美國副助理國務卿（以及未來的駐泰大使），他希望「輸出」民主：「在仰光之後，我們去北京……假若成功，我們就可以輸出到你們在拉丁美洲那些人。」上述聲明的歷史諷刺之處在於，以塔克辛治下的中泰關係，治理方式的不平衡完全倒向中國這一方。曼谷從北京輸入威權資本主義（authoritarian capitalism），在沙立時代尚未接受得如此徹底，而沙立是談論「泰國式民主」的第一人。與沙立（而非中國）相仿，塔克辛及其對手與後繼者全都將在非民主追求政治權力與經濟益處時，召喚民主。
其中最重要的因素是塔克辛這個人。據早年團隊成員沙勒辛所述：「塔克辛十分明確：『我要用民主當作達成我目標的手段』，而那就是威權主義。」意在增加政府部門力量的一九九七年憲法助了塔克辛一臂之力，他宣布憲法裡抑制與平衡的「基礎架構」無效。在二○○五年的連任競選宣傳時，他批評民主妨礙了「人民的工作」。誠然，使塔克辛政府獲得不容質疑的合法性，以及分析他實際治理所得出的認知不協調，責任皆歸屬於投票給他的絕大多數泰國人。人們讓他掌權，樂意接受他的威權主義，例如估計有四分之三的人口支持他的反毒戰爭。
相反地，泰國公民社會證實了在利基議題以外毫無政治因素價值。誕生自「泰國之春」且獲益於金融危機，公民社會未及壯大得足以抵擋塔克辛的妖魔化。泰國的禁衛軍歷史、階級與任命的文化、填鴨式教育體制及反對批判思考，全都對其不利。由於「『公民』的所有泰語翻譯都是國家創造的詞彙，用以強加責任，而非權利於人民」，非政府組織很容易被看作不具代表性、無用且不屬於泰國。
此外，當二○○五年終於有一個組織克服萬難，他們卻是人民民主聯盟的創辦者、成員與支持者，致力於促使塔克辛下台。由於總理已二度贏得多數票，人民民主聯盟企圖以委任制取代民主選舉，使其組織名稱的三個字裡頭僅有「聯盟」的聲稱為真。聯盟也主張政變應明確獲憲法保障。加入聯盟領導人林明達的是詹龍・斯里滿，即軍方的「少壯派」，在蘇欽達的一九九二年政變後，詹龍同樣機械式地高喊「民主」以延續勢力。尤為顯著的是人民民主聯盟享有泰國民主黨（自一九九二年後從未贏得大選），以及軍方重要派系的支持。來自王室的支持起初至多僅屬默許，人民民主聯盟從一開始就高舉保皇主義，做為達成目的的修辭手段。於是網絡君主制不僅與塔克辛對立，甚至顯露一系列保守特質，意圖開展新局面。
根據人權觀察組織（Human Rights Watch）的泰國專家所述，人民民主聯盟認為塔克辛是「可能受貪腐牽連下台的威權主義。他們抱著對於一九七○年代的懷念看待此事，當時他們遁入叢林，多數人信奉毛主義意識型態。他們仍然對中國懷有此種舊時情感。他們崇尚毛澤東的威權主義」。有一點需闡明，儘管跟中國人關係密切，在泰國新的政治對立局面下，沒有一方提倡明確採行中國的統治制度。至高無上的共產黨掌管解放軍與經濟，在形式上就截然相異於泰國的禁衛軍式網絡君主制及全球化的新富階級。
一直到二○○六年，少數人民民主聯盟普通成員仍然抱持真正的民主動機。但是雙方皆愈發認為所獲支持的程度與本質，分別是國王與選民，賦予他們專享且不容置疑的統治權。政治對手變成敵人，媒體和非政府組織的批判都在撒謊，法治出於主觀，尊重人權則視情況而定。也就是說在精神與實質層面上，有市場經濟做後盾的中國模式威權政府正越過國界掌控大局。「中國力量影響泰國政治，」潘薩於二○○六年告訴美方，「而舊菁英對此甚至渾然不覺。」
政變
二○○六年九月十九日晚上，坦克車隊開進曼谷，迅速發動一場實質的不流血政變。這是泰國於十五年內首見的政變，從一九三二年至今則是第十一次，此外尚有七次嘗試失敗。塔克辛人在紐約，隔天要向聯合國大會發表演說。反觀地球另一邊的北京，中國外交部發言人簡短評論：
泰國內部發生的變局屬於其國內事務。中國政府一貫維持不干預他國內部事務的原則……我們期望泰國和諧、繁榮、和平與穩定。我們希望見到中泰間的友好關係持續進展。
中國總理溫家寶寫了一封廣獲報導的信給泰國外交部，指出「中國與泰國間的固有情誼可追溯至古代」，而且兩國「就像彼此的親密家人」。
然而在中國外交部內，其駐泰最高外交人員「由於未能預測政變失去了中國領導階層的信任」。大使被暫時召回北京，監聽得知《光明日報》駐曼谷記者向政府官員簡報。這跟大使館的聲望不甚一致，顯示北京對其投注的期望程度，並且激起雙倍的關注與活動。「九月十九日晚上通宵工作……通報突發事件後，他們最初的重點在向北京分析，中國與被推翻總理塔克辛間的密切關係是否會傷害雙邊關係。」大使及時返回崗位，在內閣組建前會見泰國的新軍系總理，這是中方首次獲得的機會且原先僅由美方專享。
縱然失去了近代史上最堅定的泰國夥伴，北京仍無所畏懼。中國大使館正確「建議北京，中國在泰國的影響力出於多種因素，且依舊強盛，諸如商業連結漸增、文化聯繫、融洽的外交關係，以及軍事合作方案增長。」在二○○六年底，塔克辛的努力與其他因素同樣促成此局面，但是這絕對不限於一人或甚至兩國之力；美方持續在不自覺的情況下提供助力。「中國人關心的是建制而非民主價值，所以（政變後）中方一切如常」，塔克辛如此認為。中國人提供在北京外圍的一棟房子任他使用，承諾無論何時他來訪都會派一位高階官員到機場——「每次都有」，塔克辛於二○一五年證實。「他們從不忘記老朋友。」

親中？親美？看泰國如何在中美間夾縫求生！在外交上施行「對沖政策」的泰國，可以給予台灣什麼啟示？原本是美國堅實盟友的泰國，是如何因為美國錯估形勢、中國強勢崛起，而成為中美兩強縱橫的角力場？泰國又如何抓準時機，謀取最大利益？

自第二次世界大戰以來，泰國曾經將自己定位為美國的重要戰略盟友，在越戰時泰國是美國在東南亞反共的堡壘，以及美軍的基地。同時美國也提供數百萬元的軍事和經濟援助，做為回報。然而，作者觀察到近幾十年來泰國的對外關係出現了驚人的逆轉，曾經是死敵的中國，如今被泰國軍政府視為有價值的盟友。這項轉變反映了中國一步步增加在東南亞的影響力，也同時是美國在亞洲的重大挫折。
在本書中，作者班傑明・札瓦基考察泰國自一九四五年到二○一四年的政治發展，以堅實的歷史分析，大量的文獻紀錄和深度訪談，剖析原本是美國堅實盟友的泰國，為何會向中國投懷送抱。泰國與東南亞各國又如何在美國宣布「重返亞太」時，成為中美雙方的角力場、全球事務的戰場。這場外交戰爭虛掩在泰國內政的派系鬥爭、選舉角力、軍事政變、經濟發展與財閥崛起的錯縱脈絡間，兩頭牽拉的是崛起中國強化地緣安全的需求，以及冷戰後美國對於亞洲發展的政治短視與錯估形勢。
作者在本書最後總結，泰國往中國的偏移，對於整個東南亞區域未來發展方向是重要指標，因為每個國家都將面臨與泰國類似的區域經濟與地緣政治的抉擇，到底該親中還是親美，要如何才能求取國家的最大利益。

""Thailand"": Taksim wants to ""export"" democracy to Beijing, but instead ""inputs"" authoritarian capitalism
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that according to the early team member Shalesin: ""Taksim is very clear: ""I want to use democracy as a means to achieve my goal"", and that is authoritarianism."" Intended to increase government departments The 1997 Constitution of Power helped Taksim, and he declared that the ""infrastructure"" of restraint and balance in the Constitution was invalid. In the re-election campaign in 2005, he criticized democracy for hindering ""people's work.""



Text: Benjamin Zawacki
According to historian David K. Wyatt, the army marshal Shari in the late 1950s was ""cruel, greedy, arbitrary, and dictatorial. He regressed parliamentary democracy and human rights, he let Thailand The international status is linked to the bright and dazzling American stars, and he has mortgaged the country's future."" Taksim’s turn to China is more cautious than Shari’s preference for the United States, and China’s geopolitical interests in Thailand do not need to use its protective power. But Beijing is increasingly affecting human rights under Taksim. Taksim’s Minister of the Interior is pleased to recall that China’s “never, never, never” comments on southern Thailand, but since 2004, the Thai side has indeed discussed its internal security affairs with China.
The commander in charge of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China met with the Thai Defense Minister. Uighurs and most southern Thais have Islamic identity, and those who resist Beijing's dominance are considered ""terrorists."" Taksim is also interested in the anti-terrorism of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is operated by China and excludes the United States. Taksim follows the interests of Beijing in the ""separatist"" that Beijing regards as a national security threat. The Chinese media stationed in Thailand was allowed to publish all government decrees under the Xinjiang and Tibet policies in Beijing. After China sponsored Thai journalists in Tibet in 2004, similar reports were also published in Thai domestic newspapers. In the following year, Taksim decided to overthrow Sichuan and follow the Chinese requirements and refused to enter the Dalai Lama. ""We can build relationships with the Dalai Lama in terms of culture and religion, not as national or government leaders.""
In April 2001, pressure from both countries forced Falun Gong to cancel its meeting in Bangkok. Taksim initially reaffirmed Sichuan’s arguments and invoked domestic laws that allowed for the peaceful expression of faith, but then ordered that the rally could not be used as a forum for criticizing China. The Taihua group showed a change in political views only during the two years of Chuanxia, and supported the hard-line approach. The police chief of Thailand made it clear: ""We want to maintain good relations with China."" Similarly, the expulsion of Falun Gong followers from the city before the APEC in 2003 also came directly from the pressure of Beijing. However, in the view of the US Embassy, ""there is no reason at the moment to believe that the Thai side will oppose the US relocation of Falun Gong cases."" The US urgently took action in 2005. In Taksim’s words: “We cooperate, but we have never deported them because they have not really violated any crimes. Maybe they hold different ideologies, but we just stop their activities, say : ""Please don't do this, we don't want to hurt the relationship with China, don't do it."" They said yes. But we never drove them back to China.""
But they rushed back to other people, the Chinese dissidents who lost in a political wrestling battle. Under Taksim, the US maintains a slightly marginal position, but the recent development is that China even demonstrates its strength on this issue and gains advantages in the next few years. In 2001, China asked Thailand to investigate a person who claimed to blow up the Chinese embassy. The Thai side did not find evidence of specific claims, but said they found a letter from the person to the Taiwan Defense Minister about the attack on China. Due to the lack of grounds for prosecution, Thailand deported him and prohibited re-entry, and the person was immediately imprisoned in China. A US senator put pressure on the Thai side to ask for more information, even ""the CCP officials in Bangkok have taken the initiative to force them"" - usually by cash remittance. An official told the US that he ""does not want himself or the Royal Thai Police to be a tool for political affairs in other countries,"" but this is the case.
However, in 2004, human rights won twice. First, Surakia asked the United Nations to assess the asylum claim of a well-known Chinese dissident, and the United States immediately relocated him within seven days. Second, two members of a Chinese rock band arrived in Thailand after the pro-Taiwan performance. ""Chinese high-ranking officials immediately requested the two to be repatriated to China during the visit of Prime Minister Taksim."" Although Taksim issued an arrest warrant, When they quickly fled to Cambodia and obtained the protection of Swedish officials, the authorities turned a blind eye. The degree of involvement of US diplomats is unknown. The United Nations also has at least 100 records of lesser-known Chinese seeking asylum, some of which have been relocated to the United States or elsewhere. In Taksim’s words: ""We never want to repatriate women or children. We must act with caution.""
Between repatriation and resettlement, there are still involuntary departures from national borders. After ""the pressure on them in the middle"", the Thai authorities forced a dissident to accept the eviction in 2005, assuring him that neither China nor Thailand would interfere with his low-profile re-entry into Thailand. Although he did not want to accept it, he was still expelled. When another dissident was arrested on the US website, Thailand refused to repatriate him without an official extradition request, but allowed Chinese officials to visit him while he was in detention. The Thai side told the US that they tried to balance humanity considerations, policy continuity, and relations with Beijing, and then the Thai side forced the dissident to accept the eviction. They also argue that they cannot be regarded as ""what the United States requires to do."" The dissidents also refused to accept the offer, but they were still being removed. This makes Taksim's conclusions and records not completely consistent: ""We only repatriate people who actually commit serious crimes - unlike the war on terrorism, and not because of differences in ideology.""
Chinese model
Taksim said after four months of election that Thailand will not interfere with neighboring countries: ""But we will convince them that democracy is better because we are enjoying democratic cuisine now... Instead of trying to force them to change their eating habits, we can convince them Taste a little democracy."" Six months before the coup in 2006, Pansa, a supporter of Taksim’s thought, told the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (and the future Ambassador to Thailand) that he hoped to ""export"" democracy: ""In After Yangon, we went to Beijing... If we succeed, we can export to those of you in Latin America.” The historical irony of the above statement is that the Sino-Thai relationship under Taksim’s governance is not balanced. It is completely down to China. Bangkok imported authoritarian capitalism from Beijing, which has not been accepted so thoroughly in the Shali era, and Shari is the first person to talk about ""Thai-style democracy."" Similar to Shali (rather than China), Taksim and his opponents and successors will all summon democracy when non-democratic pursuit of political power and economic benefits.
The most important factor is Taksim. According to Shalesin, a member of the early team, ""Taksim is very clear: ""I want to use democracy as a means to achieve my goal,"" and that is authoritarianism."" In 1997, intended to increase the power of government. The Constitution helped Taksim, and he declared that the ""infrastructure"" of restraint and balance in the Constitution was invalid. In the re-election campaign in 2005, he criticized democracy for hindering ""people's work."" It is true that the Takshin government has obtained unquestionable legitimacy and analyzed the cognitive dissonance of his actual governance, and the responsibilities are attributed to the majority of Thais who voted for him. People let him take power and be willing to accept his authoritarianism. For example, an estimated three-quarters of the population supports his anti-drug war.
Conversely, Thai civil society has confirmed that there is no political factor outside the niche issue. Born from the ""Thailand Spring"" and benefited from the financial crisis, civil society has not grown enough to withstand the demonization of Taksim. The history of the Guards in Thailand, the culture of class and appointment, the system of cramming education and the opposition to critical thinking are all unfavourable. Since all the Thai translations of ""citizens"" are vocabulary created by the state to impose responsibilities rather than rights to the people, NGOs can easily be seen as unrepresentative, useless and not part of Thailand.
In addition, when an organization finally overcomes all odds in 2005, they are the founders, members and supporters of the People's Democratic Alliance, and are committed to bringing Taksim to step down. Since the Prime Minister has won a majority vote twice, the People’s Alliance for Democracy attempted to replace the democratic election with an appointment system, making the claims of the “Alliance” in the three words of the organization’s name true. The coalition also advocates that the coup should be clearly guaranteed by the Constitution. Joining the leader of the alliance, Lin Mingda, is Zhan Long Si Li Man, the military's ""small and strong"". After the 1992 coup in Suqinda, Zhan Long also mechanically shouted ""democracy"" to continue. power. What is particularly striking is that the People’s Democratic League enjoys the support of the Thai Democratic Party (which has never won a general election since 1992) and the important factions of the military. The support from the royal family was at best acquiescence at first, and the People’s Democratic Alliance held the royalistism from the beginning as a rhetorical means to achieve its goal. Therefore, the network monarchy not only opposes Taksim, but even reveals a series of conservative qualities, with the intention of launching a new situation.
According to a Thai expert from Human Rights Watch, the People’s Democratic League believes that Taksim is “an authoritarianism that may be implicated in corruption. They are looking at this matter with nostalgia for the 1970s, when They broke into the jungle, and most people believed in Maoist ideology. They still have such old-time feelings for China. They advocate Mao Zedong's authoritarianism."" One thing to be clarified is that despite the close relationship with the Chinese, no one party advocates a clear adoption of China's ruling system under the new political opposition in Thailand. The supreme Communist Party is in charge of the People's Liberation Army and the economy. The form is completely different from the Thai garrison-style network monarchy and the new wealthy class of globalization.
Until 2006, ordinary members of the Minority People’s Alliance for Democracy still held a genuine democratic motive. But both sides are increasingly convinced that the extent and nature of the support they receive are the king and the voters, giving them exclusive and unquestionable rule. Political opponents become enemies, and critiques of the media and non-governmental organizations are lying. The rule of law is subjective and respect for human rights depends on the situation. That is to say, on the spiritual and substantive level, the Chinese model authoritarian government backed by the market economy is crossing the national border to control the overall situation. ""Chinese forces influence Thai politics,"" Pansa told the US in 2006. ""And the old elite is even unaware of this.""
coup
On the evening of September 19, 2006, the tank team drove into Bangkok and quickly launched a substantial bloodless coup. This is the first coup in Thailand in fifteen years. It has been the eleventh since 1932, and there have been seven attempts to fail. The Taksim people in New York will deliver a speech to the UN General Assembly the next day. In contrast to Beijing on the other side of the globe, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry gave a brief comment:
The changes that have taken place within Thailand are part of their domestic affairs. The Chinese government has consistently maintained the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries... We expect harmony, prosperity, peace and stability in Thailand. We hope to see the friendly relations between China and Thailand continue to progress.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao wrote a widely reported letter to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that ""the inherent friendship between China and Thailand can be traced back to ancient times"" and that the two countries ""are like each other's close family.""
However, within the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the highest diplomat in Thailand ""has lost the trust of the Chinese leadership because of the failure to predict a coup."" The ambassador was temporarily recalled to Beijing to hear that the Guangming Daily reporter in Bangkok briefed the government officials. This is not consistent with the reputation of the embassy, showing Beijing's expectations of its bets and stimulating double attention and activity. ""Overnight work on September 19th... After the incident was reported, their initial focus was on analyzing Beijing. Whether the close relationship between China and the overthrown Prime Minister Taksim would hurt bilateral relations."" The ambassador returned to his post in time. Meet with the Prime Minister of the new military department of Thailand before the formation of the cabinet. This is the first time that China has won the opportunity and was originally exclusively enjoyed by the US.
Even without the most determined Thai partner in modern history, Beijing is still fearless. The Chinese Embassy correctly ""recommend Beijing, China's influence in Thailand is due to a variety of factors, and it is still strong, such as the increasing number of business links, cultural connections, harmonious diplomatic relations, and the growth of military cooperation programs."" At the end of 2006 Taksim’s efforts and other factors have contributed to this situation, but this is definitely not limited to the power of one person or even both countries; the United States continues to provide assistance without unconsciously. ""The Chinese are concerned with the establishment rather than the democratic value, so after the coup, China is doing everything as usual,"" Taksim thinks. The Chinese offered a house outside Beijing to be used by him. He promised to send a high-ranking official to the airport whenever he visited - ""every time,"" Taksim confirmed in 2015. ""They never forget old friends.""

Pro? Pro-American? See how Thailand survives between China and the United States! What kind of revelation can Taiwan give to Taiwan that implements a ""hedging policy"" in diplomacy? Thailand, which was originally a solid ally of the United States, has become a cornerstone between China and the United States because of the United States’ miscalculation of the situation and China’s strong rise. How can Thailand seize the opportunity and seek the best interests?

Since the Second World War, Thailand has positioned itself as an important strategic ally of the United States. During the Vietnam War, Thailand was the bastion of the United States in Southeast Asia and the base of the US military. At the same time, the United States also provides millions of military and economic assistance in return. However, the author observes an amazing reversal of Thailand's foreign relations in recent decades. China, once a deadly enemy, is now regarded as a valuable ally by the Thai military government. This shift reflects China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia and is also a major setback for the United States in Asia.
In this book, author Benjamin Zawaki examines the political development of Thailand from 1945 to 2014. With a solid historical analysis, extensive literature records and in-depth interviews, it is a solid American ally. Thailand, why is it to send a hug to China? How did Thailand and Southeast Asian countries become the battlefield between China and the United States and the global affairs when they announced their ""return to the Asia-Pacific"" in the United States. This diplomatic war is looming over the misunderstandings of the factional struggles, electoral wrangles, military coups, economic development and the rise of the chaebol in Thailand’s internal affairs. The two are pulling the need to strengthen China’s geopolitical security and the development of the United States after the Cold War. Political short-sightedness and miscalculation of the situation.
At the end of the book, the author concludes that the shift of Thailand to China is an important indicator for the future development of the entire Southeast Asian region, because each country will face a similar regional economic and geopolitical choices with Thailand. How can we seek the best interests of the country?
