      <p>SAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) - The San Marcos Police Department has released body camera video of a police officer using a stun gun on a man while attempting to break up a Halloween party.</p>
      <p>KVUE television reports a police officer used a stun gun against 23-year-old Jeremy Noah Terry Costly on Thursday while responding to a call at an apartment complex.</p>
      <p>City officials say the building property manager told authorities that no one had permission to be in the complex’s clubhouse.</p>
      <p>Officials say Costly shut the door and pushed one officer as he attempted to enter the clubhouse.</p>

        <p>The video shows Costly complying when being ordered onto his knees and told to put his hands on his head. When an officer attempted to detain him, Costly put his hands down and said “no.” The arresting officer moved away from Costly and told another officer to “tase him.”</p>
