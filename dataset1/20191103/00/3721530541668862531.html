      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942112/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-expansion-blizzcon-2019">At the BlizzCon 2019 opening ceremony</a>, Blizzard revealed <i>World of Warcraft</i><i>: Shadowlands</i>, the long-running MMO’s eighth expansion. At the end of the studio’s first deep-dive panel for <i>Shadowlands</i>, game director Ion Hazzikostas revealed something players have been waiting to hear for years: Everyone can be a Death knight.</p>
      <p>Starting with <i>Shadowlands</i> (and starting early next year for <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_content=29191368&amp;utm_campaign=BLZ_WoW_L_9.0_Announce_Q4_2019_NA">players who pre-order</a> the expansion), players can make a Death Knight class of any race. This includes the currently unavailable Pandarens from the <i>Mists of Pandaria</i> expansion, and all of the Allied Races added in <i>Battle for Azeroth</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8f5weo/official_no_allied_race_for_death_knights/">Blizzard’s original reasoning</a> for not allowing Allied Race Death Knights came from a story justification. Death Knights were undead servants of Arthas as the Lich King. Players defeated Arthas back in <i>Wrath of the Lich King</i>, and his successor, Bolvar Fordragon, hasn’t made any new Death Knights. Blizzard reasoned it wouldn’t make sense to have new playable races rise from the dead as Death Knights.</p>
      <p>For unknown reasons, that ban on Allied Race and Pandaren Death Knights is being lifted. And players are only a few months away from creating their dream Death Knight, be it a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/7/20903441/world-of-warcraft-patch-8-3-visions-of-nzoth-wow-battle-for-azeroth">fuzzy fox or mechanical Gnome</a>.</p>
      <p>Blizzard has yet to announce a release date for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands/40630"><i>World of Warcraft: Shadowlands</i></a><i> </i>or the Visions of N’Zoth patch, where early access for the new Death Knights will start.</p>
