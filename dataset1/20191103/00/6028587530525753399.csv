The S&P 500 set its all-time intraday high of 3,066.95 as November begins with its quarterly and monthly risky levels at 3,076.9 and 3,089.5, respectively.
The Nasdaq Composite set its all-time intraday high of 8,386.75 on Friday with its monthly and quarterly risky levels at 8,469 and 8,591, respectively.
As the major averages rise to these major risky levels it’s time to reduce allocations to stocks to the minimum percentages in your investment guidelines.
The five major averages are above their semiannual pivots. The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Transports and Russell 2000 ended last week above semiannual pivots at 27,266, 2,955.6, 7,999, 10.720 and 1,572.85, respectively.  
The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq remain above their annual pivots at 25,819, 2,867.1 and 7,370 Nasdaq, respectively. Transports and Russell 2000 remain below their annual pivots at 10,976 and 1,590.63.
All five major averages have positive weekly charts, so the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq remain in striking distance of setting new all-time intraday highs.
The Dow is between its semiannual pivot at 27,266 and quarterly risky level at 28,537 with its all-time intraday high in-between at 27,398.68 (July 16).
The S&P and Nasdaq are below their November and fourth quarter risky levels at 3,089.5 and 3,076.9, and 8,469 and 8,591, respectively, which are above their all-time intraday highs of 3,066.95 (November 1) and 8,386.75 (November 1). I still view new highs as an opportunity to reduce holdings and raise cash.
Dow transports is below its quarterly and annual risky levels at 10,864 and 10,976 versus its all-time intraday high of 11,623.58 set on Sep. 14, 2018.
The Russell 2000 is below its annual and quarterly risky levels at 1,590.63 and 1,599.49, respectively, versus its all-time intraday high of 1,742.09 set on August 31, 2018.

The Dow Transportation Average (10,738.81 on November 1) is 24.3% above its Dec. 24 intraday low of 8,636.79 and is 7.6% below its all-time intraday high of 11,623.58 set on September 14, 2018.

How to use my value levels and risky levels:

Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on Dec. 31, 2018. The original annual level remains in play.
The close at the end of June 2019 established new monthly, quarterly and semiannual levels. The semiannual level for the second half of 2019 remains in play.
The quarterly level changes after the end of each quarter so the close on September 30 established the level for the fourth quarter. The close on October 31 established the monthly level for November as monthly levels change at the end of each month.
My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.
To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.
