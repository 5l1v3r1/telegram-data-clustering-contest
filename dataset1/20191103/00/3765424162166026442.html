      <p>REGIONAL cement maker Pretoria Portland Cement says cement sales at its Zimbabwe unit went down between 30 and 35 percent in four months ending 30 July due to a challenging economic climate that has seen many building projects shelved.</p>
      <p>The country has been experiencing economic challenges since the beginning of the year that has resulted in depressed activity on the construction sector weighing down on demands for construction material.</p>
      <p>In a trading update, PPC said trading conditions in Zimbabwe remained challenging due to liquidity challenges and inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>“PPC remains focused on optimising its local operations and implementing its cash preservation strategy to ensure the business is self-sufficient. The devaluation of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) dollar versus the US$ impacted revenue, which declined by 30-35 percent in rand. Overall cement sales volumes contracted by 25-30 percent due to a weaker economic climate,” the company said.</p>
      <p>PPC said cement pricing, which was aligned with input cost inflation, was higher than the previous comparable period.</p>
      <p>The price of cement has also gone up in relation to the declining incomes of most workers in the country.</p>
      <p>In 2016, PPC commissioned a US$82 million plant in Harare which has been supplying the northern markets and catering for exports to neighbouring countries north of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>The company also owns two other plants in Zimbabwe, in Bulawayo and Colleen Bawn near Gwanda with a production capacity of 700 000 tonnes annually.</p>
      <p>Although the Zimbabwean unit is struggling, PPC announced that its Rwanda unit is growing due to increased economic activity.</p>
      <p>“In Rwanda, Cimerwa continues to benefit from increased construction activity and high economic growth. The successful completion of first phase de-bottlenecking of the plant has resulted in higher cement sales. Overall volumes for the period increased by 35-40 percent, coupled with stable pricing.”</p>
      <p>The company also has operations in South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>It said in the outlook, PPC will continue to focus on stabilising the performance of its core operations and positioning the group for future growth.</p>
