      <p>Manchester United's revival came to a disappointing end as Bournemouth forward Joshua King's goal on the stroke of halftime earned a 1-0 victory on a blustery south coast on Saturday.</p>
      <p>BOURNEMOUTH, England: Manchester United's revival came to a disappointing end as Bournemouth forward Joshua King's goal on the stroke of halftime earned a 1-0 victory on a blustery south coast on Saturday.</p>
      <p>King volleyed in from close range as Bournemouth scored their first Premier League goal for more than a month.</p>

      <p>Victory lifted Eddie Howe's side above United into sixth place in the table with 16 points from 11 games ahead of Saturday's later kickoffs.</p>
      <p>United had won three successive away games in all competitions but despite starting and finishing strongly against Bournemouth they could have few complaints at the defeat.</p>
      <p>They did raise the tempo in the closing stages with Mason Greenwood hitting the post with a volley immediately after coming on as a substitute but Bournemouth held on.</p>
      <p>United have still not won back-to-back Premier League games since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was named permanent manager in March and their haul of 13 points from 11 matches represents their lowest total since 1986-87.</p>
      <p>"We are disappointed but when you come to places like this you have to take control of the game," Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>"We have to win games like this. We are disappointed. We have to look forward now though."</p>
      <p>With wind and rain lashing the Vitality Stadium, United actually had a spring in their step and Daniel James was causing havoc in the Bournemouth defence with his pace.</p>
      <p>His run and cross should have seen Fred give United the lead and the Welshman also provided a chance for Andreas Pereira but he blazed a powerful shot over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>James also shot just wide but United's early storm blew out.</p>
      <p>HOME THREAT</p>
      <p>Bournemouth began to threaten with Callum Wilson's ball finding King who in turn fed Ryan Fraser but he fired straight at goalkeeper David de Gea.</p>
      <p>United's Anthony Martial was then shouldered off the ball by Jefferson Lerma but his appeals for a penalty were waved away, prompting tempers to flare.</p>
      <p>King broke the deadlock just before the interval.</p>
      <p>Receiving the ball on his chest with his back to goal, the Norwegian flicked the ball up and over Aaron Wan-Bissaka before spinning past the bemused United defender to volley home.</p>
      <p>It stretched United's run of Premier League away games without a clean sheet to 11.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth were content to play on the counter-attack in the second half but still looked the more dangerous with De Gea making a superb low save to deny Harry Wilson.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer sent on teenagers Greenwood and Brandon Williams for James and Wan-Bissaka late on but Bournemouth defended tenaciously to keep a third successive clean sheet.</p>
      <p>"It was very good today," Howe said. "We were very good with the ball and dogged and determined off the ball.</p>
      <p>"I thought we fully deserved to win."</p>
