03 Nov 2019 by 黃揚明, 林育緯
國片《陽光普照》1日上映，前副總統蕭萬長2日與妻子朱俶賢特地到電影院欣賞這部新片。蕭萬長對片中飾演阿和父親的演員陳以文的表現印象特別深刻，稱讚陳把一個父親嘴上不對孩子說愛，但還是用行動表現出「天下父母心」的演技非常傑出。
蕭萬長說，這部電影描述的雖然是很嚴肅的現代社會、家庭現象，但有很深的意義，值得觀眾欣賞，尤其現在台灣重視軟實力，國片應該要多鼓勵，希望大家多多觀賞，給它多一點鼓勵。
被問到對哪一個角色印象特別深刻，蕭萬長認為陳以文飾演的父親非常特別，和現在社會上很多家庭一樣，對某一位小孩特別偏愛，結果會變成畸形的發展。


蕭萬長稱陳以文在劇中用行動來表現，「這就是天下父母心」。

蕭萬長還說，這位父親雖然嘴巴上不講愛，但心裡頭還是很愛巫建和飾演的阿和，用行動來表現，「這就是天下父母心」。
許久沒到電影院看電影的朱俶賢看完電影直呼：「父母真難為！」特別對飾演阿和母親的演員柯淑勤印象深刻，認為她演得很好，電影的編劇也別具用心。而蕭萬長也認為電影中的媽媽是很了不起的媽媽。


中華電信前董事長鄭優大讚柯淑勤演技，「真的是影后！」。

中華電信前董事長鄭優2日也欣賞了《陽光普照》，他說，這是一部好看的電影，描述當孩子碰到狀況，父母親為了保護孩子，怎麼樣的事情都會去做，讓人看了很感動。他對柯淑勤的演技讚譽有加，過去他擔任台視總經理時就體驗過柯的演技，功力非常不簡單，「真的是影后！」
《陽光普照》入圍今年金馬獎11項大獎，鄭優認為，這部電影值得一看，勇奪金馬的機會應該很高。

03 Nov 2019 by Huang Yangming, Lin Yuwei
The film ""Sunshine"" was released on the 1st. Former Vice President Xiao Wanchang and his wife Zhu Xixian went to the cinema to enjoy the new film. Xiao Wanchang was particularly impressed with the performance of Chen Yiwen, an actor who plays Ah and his father in the film. He praised Chen for not expressing love to his father in his mouth, but he still performed his acting with the action of ""the parents of the world"".
Xiao Wanchang said that although this film describes a very serious modern society and family phenomenon, it has deep meaning and is worthy of appreciation by the audience. Especially now that Taiwan attaches importance to soft power, the Chinese film should be encouraged more. I hope everyone can watch it and give it to everyone. It is a little more encouraging.
I was asked which role I was particularly impressed with. Xiao Wanchang believed that Chen Yiwen’s father was very special. Like many families in the society, he was particularly fond of a child and the result would become a deformed development.


Xiao Wanchang said that Chen Yiwen used actions to express his actions in the play. ""This is the parents of the world.""

Xiao Wanchang also said that although the father did not talk about love in his mouth, he still loved Wu Jian and played the role of Ah He, acting with his actions. ""This is the parent of the world.""
Zhu Yuxian, who hasn’t been to the cinema for a long time, watched the movie and said: “Parents are really difficult!” I was particularly impressed by the actress Ke Shuqin who played the role of Ah and her mother. She thought that she played well and the screenwriter of the film was also very careful. Xiao Wanchang also believes that the mother in the movie is a very great mother.


Zheng You, the former chairman of Chunghwa Telecom, praised Ke Shuqin for acting. ""It is really a shadow!""

Zheng You, former chairman of Chunghwa Telecom, also appreciated the ""Sunshine Pass"" on the 2nd. He said that this is a good-looking movie, describing how things will happen when parents meet the situation and parents want to protect their children. People looked very moved. He praised Ke Shuqin's acting skills. In the past, he had experienced Ke's acting skills when he was the general manager of Taiwan. The skill was very simple. ""It is really a shadow!""
""Sunshine"" was nominated for the 11th Golden Horse Award this year. Zheng You believes that this movie is worth seeing. The chance to win the Golden Horse should be high.
