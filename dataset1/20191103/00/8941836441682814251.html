      <p>LONDON (AP) - Jamie Vardy scored late to take Leicester third in the Premier League by sealing a 2-0 win at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/crystal-palace/">Crystal Palace</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Turkish defender Caglar Söyüncü opened the scoring with his first goal in the league in the 57th minute, when he was left free to head in after a deflected corner.</p>
