LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Just more of the same
03 Nov 2019 by THE WASHINGTON TIMES

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

As the 2020 election approaches, the cold war started by the Democrats two years ago has been ramped up to prevent the re-election of President Trump. The “whistleblower” report is essentially just a continuation of the second Steele opposition-research dossier.
Democrats who advanced the Russia-collusion hoax and Mueller report are now continuing their impeachment drive with the whistleblower allegations written by Democratic congressional staffers and former Obama administration members. Mr. Trump is right to ask Rep. Adam Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee to resign after Mr. Schiff created lies from the transcript of Mr. Trump’s conversation with the president of Ukraine. Mr. Schiff continues to use the same allegations, which he presented for three years with the supporting liberal media. The allegations were then disproven, and like the media reports, were shown to be bogus.
