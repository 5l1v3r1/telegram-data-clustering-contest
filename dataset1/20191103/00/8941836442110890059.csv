Dental school in Joplin raises 75% of its fundraising goal

03 Nov 2019

JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) - Less than five months after announcing plans for a dental school in Joplin, the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences has raised 75% percent of its $40 million fundraising goal.
The $40 million will make up half of the project’s $80 million cost, with the KCU pledging the other $40 million.
The Joplin Globe reports supporters say the College of Dental Medicine will address a critical need for oral health care in underserved areas. Nearly all counties within a 125-mile radius of Joplin have a shortage of dental health providers.
Current plans call for the first class of 80 students to start in 2022. A groundbreaking is scheduled for next year and a nationwide search for a dean is currently underway.
