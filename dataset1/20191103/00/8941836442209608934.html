      <p>MINNEAPOLIS — A state senator from Minnesota says he’s the victim of “revenge porn” perpetrated by a “former friend” who sent explicit images to legislative colleagues.</p>
      <p>Democratic <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-dibble/">Sen. Scott Dibble</a> says he’s been harassed for the past five months by a man with whom he had an intimate, virtual relationship. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-dibble/">Dibble</a>, who is married, said the man sent private photos, videos, and text messages to fellow lawmakers on Friday. A spokeswoman for the Minnesota’s Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, Ellen Anderson, confirmed that lawmakers received such messages.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-dibble/">Dibble</a>’s announcement comes just days after U.S. Rep. Katie Hill of California resigned after nude photos of her were made public.</p>
