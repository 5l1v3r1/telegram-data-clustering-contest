      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington</a>’s newly crowned championship baseball team provided the cheers. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jakub-vrana/">Jakub Vrana</a> supplied the goals.</p>
      <p>Two days after his first multigoal game of the season, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jakub-vrana/">Jakub Vrana</a> got his first career hat trick as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Washington Capitals</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/calgary-flames/">Calgary Flames</a> 4-2 Sunday night.</p>
      <p>With the World Series-winning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington Nationals</a> looking on, Vrana scored twice in the first period before putting the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> up for good with a breakaway goal late in the second. The hat trick also completed Vrana’s first career consecutive multigoal games.</p>
      <p>“I’m not that surprised,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> center Lars Eller, who added a power-play goal in the third period. “He has it in him. I don’t expect him to score three every night but he’s got that kind of talent that he can do that once in awhile.”.</p>
      <p>Vrana praised the Nationals, who roused the home crowd throughout the evening by taking the World Series trophy on the ice before the game and celebrating each <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> goal in animated fashion.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> previously took the Stanley Cup to Nationals Park after winning it in 2018.</p>
      <p>“That was unbelievable,” Vrana said. “It just brings me a little memory from when we won. They brought us lots of energy.”</p>
      <p>Evgeny Kuznetsov and Tom Wilson each had two assists for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a>, who have won eight of nine and lead the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> with 25 points. Ilya Samsonov stopped 25 shots.</p>
      <p>Elias Lindholm and Andrew Mangiapane scored for Calgary, and Cam Talbot finished with 28 saves. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/calgary-flames/">Flames</a> finished 2-2-0 on a four-game road trip.</p>

        <p>Calgary earned only two power plays while extending its streak without a goal on the man advantage to a season-high four games.</p>
        <p>“I thought the effort was there,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/calgary-flames/">Flames</a> coach Bill Peters said. “We needed that kill in the third, the first one. We needed to keep it at 3-2 there. They got a little bit of wiggle room, and then we couldn’t find a way to get the next one.”</p>
        <p>Vrana now has nine goals through 16 games, with the 23-year-old Czech well on pace to exceed his previous high of 24 from last season.</p>
        <p>After Mangiapane opened the scoring, Vrana got his first goal when Wilson found Kuznetsov down the right. Kuznetsov sent a cross-ice pass to Vrana, who beat two <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/calgary-flames/">Flames</a> defenders down the ice and Talbot to his stick side.</p>
        <p>Vrana gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington</a> its first lead with 4:52 left in the first when he was first to the puck in the offensive zone after Kuznetsov had it poked away and beat Talbot with a wrister to the top left corner.</p>
        <p>Lindholm got his 10th of the season to tie the score with 1.6 seconds remaining before the first intermission, but Vrana gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington</a> the lead for good with 4:55 left in the second.</p>
        <p>This time Kuznetsov found him from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington</a>’s own zone for a breakaway, and while Talbot made a pad save on Vrana’s first effort, he couldn’t keep out the rebound.</p>
        <p>“I just tried to find the space there,” Vrana said. “Kuzy, it was a great (pass) for me. I was just skating, and I had a breakaway.”</p>
        <p>NOTES: A day after their celebratory parade, the Nationals were welcomed on the ice during player introductions while decked in white <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> jerseys. Later, Adam Eaton and pitcher Max Scherzer were among several players who took a shirtless Zamboni ride during the second intermission. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-capitals/">Capitals</a> LW Alex Ovechkin became the first member of the 2004 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> draft class to play in his 1,100th career game . Lindholm now has a seven-game point streak, which began in last month’s 5-3 loss to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-nationals/">Washington</a>. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/calgary-flames/">Flames</a> LW Milan Lucic served the first of his two-game suspension for a roughing incident in Saturday’s win over Columbus.</p>
