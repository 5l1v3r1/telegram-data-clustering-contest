從吉野櫻到埃及聖䴉，將「外來入侵物種」連根拔起就能解決問題嗎？

我們想讓你知道的是回頭看看近來台灣一窩蜂種植外來種櫻樹，人們的目光僅止於絢爛的花海，是否關心外來種植物的生與死呢？



文：林欽傑
筆者家宅巷口，曾經座落有情報相關單位廢棄的辦公廳，十多年前，森嚴的圍牆內，綠意蓊鬱、亂草叢生當中，隱約得見一座日式建築，杳無人煙；今天，那兒已是市民休閒的社區公園，園內矗立著巨大的芒果樹，據傳是百年以上的老樹，另有白千層、台灣欒樹等都市空間常見的樹木栽植其間。然而這兩年，庭圃之間赫見幾株細瘦的櫻樹，夾雜種在原本的樹木之間，如今有幾株已然乾枯。
吉野櫻的移植風
幾年前朋友開心入厝，邀大夥兒參觀，在豪華透天厝外的庭園裡，他的大手指向花圃一處，很驕傲的向大家說：「我弄來一棵吉野櫻。」時過境遷，不知那棵櫻樹現在如何？近年來台灣爆發賞櫻熱潮，為了每年兩週的「花見」季節，地方政府多有栽植櫻樹的舉動：種植於都市地區者，常有砍除原生種行道樹、園景樹，改植外來種吉野櫻的舉措，外來的櫻樹不是生長狀況不佳、滿樹枯枝，便是在短期內遭逢死亡的命運；而種植於山野郊區者，氣候得宜，或許生長狀況尚可，但是全數單一品種的種植方式，對於相形脆弱的台灣島嶼生態而言，[1]罔顧生態平衡的作法，令人憂慮。
移植吉野櫻的作為，在百年前日本時代的台灣便已然得見：隨著日本統治勢力逐步進入山野，報刊記者意外在竹子湖附近，發現台灣的原生山櫻，此景大為觸動當時在台日人的懷鄉之情，即便日治初期入山的道路未稱完善，台灣與母國的櫻花風情也不盡相同的情況下，仍然帶動當時的賞櫻風潮；之後，因為賞花、農事活動的侵入，致使櫻樹逐年損耗，也由於宣揚統治意涵的政治目的，官方開始計畫於山野移植櫻樹；而民間在休閒、享樂，併同「營造內地風景」的需求下，城市中富人庭園與其他公眾場合，也多有植櫻之舉。[2]當櫻花的身影在台灣社會逐漸清晰，同時在各個階層營造出前所未見的文化氛圍，我們清楚的看到植物與人類社會之間的綿密關係。如今，我們已難尋得日治時期在台灣都市地區所種植的櫻樹，尤其是來自日本母國的吉野櫻，生長的狀況向來不好。[3]
然而，植物未能表白情意、言說痛苦，誰會關心失當的移植與死亡之間的是多麼的靠近嗎？
川上瀧彌的移植理念
川上瀧彌，日治時期的植物學家，曾任台灣總督府技師、台灣博物館館長。在1911年台灣官方初步開啟移植母國吉野櫻的念頭時，便在《台灣日日新報》為文指出：
移植之際，當盡可能以移植、培養適合本島土地的原生種緋櫻為先，次南投霧社櫻，末方為內地櫻。[4]
即便有鄉愁、母國印象的情懷，而且植櫻行動負有官方推動長期殖民、「永住」政策的使命，川上先生，仍然堅守植物學家的基本認識，建議種植櫻樹應以原生種為主。回頭看看近來台灣一窩蜂種植外來種櫻樹，人們的目光僅止於絢爛的花海，是否關心外來種植物的生與死呢？
外來種植物的問題擴散
如前所述，吉野櫻的問題，在人為砍伐原生種，單一物種的生態失衡，與櫻樹本身因水土不服、壽命極為短暫。目前我們看得到的問題，似乎還限縮於移植作為與移植對象本身，未有向外擴散的跡象。但是，其他的外來植物，如蘇鐵的移植，便帶來極為嚴重的問題：自越南進口的蘇鐵苗木，挾帶白輪盾介殼蟲進入台灣，遭受蟲害的鐵樹，枝葉與芽心因為小蟲吸食汁液，導致枯黃無能行光合作用而死亡，台灣各地，只要是蘇鐵科的植物都難逃一劫。[5]
外來移入的植物極易附有昆蟲卵或小型昆蟲，這些昆蟲抵台後，在全新的生態世界，便有機會發生難以想像、甚至難於控制的災難。更不消說，小花蔓澤蘭、大花咸豐草、南美蟛蜞菊這些鼎鼎大名的外來入侵物種（Alien invasive species），生命力極強，大肆蔓延生長，遍生在台灣僅有的土地上，搶奪其他原生植物的生長空間，甚至與這些原生植物共生的動物也難於生存。[6]
外來入侵物種的移除？
每當外來入侵物種的問題浮上檯面，將其連根拔起似乎是解決問題最有效的方法；但是如果我們處理的對象不是植物，而是活靈活現的動物呢？又，如果是外型極為美麗的埃及聖䴉呢？連根拔起式的移除、撲殺，是你、我都能接受的作法嗎？
三十多年前，埃及聖䴉經由民間動物園業者引進台灣，之後因管理失當而逃逸，於野外迅速繁衍生息，搶佔原生鳥類的築巢穴位、吃食其他鳥類的蛋或幼鳥，如今已嚴重危害台灣本土鳥類的生存。近年來，林務局以移除巢穴、鳥蛋等較為人道的做法，企圖控制其族群量，[7]但成效有限。如今官方廣邀學者專家討論，建議對埃及聖䴉下達撲殺令。
在動物保護意識漸形抬頭之際，對象又是這樣大型的、引人注目的鳥類，林務局嚴肅的做了功課，包括：設置套索陷阱、捕捉後立即集中安置、減少掙扎時間種種實地作業規範；在動物安樂死方面，他們請教專業獸醫師並參考相關作業指引。而針對埃及聖䴉防治的長期對策，專家學者已有以下結論：
「外來種的入侵已公認為導致生物多樣性消失的重要機制，其威脅僅次於棲息地的破壞，有人甚至認為，外來入侵種根本就是導致棲息地喪失，進而造成物種滅絕的主因。」[8]
雖然如此，很遺憾的，我們又將面對腥風血雨的場面；畢竟，維持生物多樣性是目前的主流意識，讓現階段討論的重點已經化約為：該怎麼殺埃及聖䴉了。
人為無知，卻以動、植物償命
從我們生活周遭出現的吉野櫻，到河灘上外型搶眼的埃及聖䴉，為何總是人為的無知、或僅專注人類社會利益的刻意目盲，導致櫻樹的乾枯與埃及聖䴉的屠戮。為什麼呢？
今日，多數國家的法律，以人類社會的獲利為依歸，隱約鼓勵外來物種的引進，例如：寵物、農藝作物、園藝作物、生物防治用的天敵。因此，立法禁止引進外來種，維護生物多樣性，[9]落實源頭管理，讓動、植物免於人為的死亡威脅，方為正道，也實為刻難容緩之事。

From Yoshino Sakura to the Egyptian holy shrine, can the ""invasive alien species"" be uprooted to solve the problem?
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by Care for Life Association


What we want you to know is to look back and look at the recent planting of exotic cherry trees in Taiwan. People’s eyes are only on the splendid flower sea. Do you care about the life and death of exotic plants?



Text: Lin Qinjie
The author’s hometown alley has once been located in an abandoned office with intelligence-related units. More than a decade ago, within the fierce walls, the greenery and the grass were looming, and a Japanese-style building was faintly visible. It is already a community park for the citizens to relax. There are huge mango trees standing in the park. It is said to be an old tree of more than 100 years, and trees common in urban spaces such as the White Melaleuca and Taiwan Banyan are planted. However, in the past two years, there were several thin cherry trees between the courts, and the hybrids were among the original trees. Now several plants have dried up.
Yoshino cherry's transplant wind
A few years ago, my friends were happy and invited everyone to visit. In the luxurious garden, his big finger went to the flower garden, and he proudly said to everyone: ""I got a Yoshino cherry."" I don't know what the cherry tree is now? In recent years, there has been a wave of cherry blossoms in Taiwan. In order to ""flowers"" in the two weeks of the year, local governments have many plans to plant cherry trees: those who grow in urban areas often cut off native tree trees, garden trees, and planted exotic species Yoshino. Sakura's move, the foreign cherry tree is not a poor growth, full of dead branches, it is the fate of death in a short period of time; and planted in the wilderness of the mountains, the climate is appropriate, perhaps the growth is acceptable, but all single varieties The way of planting, for the fragile Taiwan island ecology, [1] the practice of disregarding the ecological balance is worrying.
The transplant of Yoshino Sakura has already been seen in Taiwan in the Japanese era a hundred years ago: as Japanese ruling forces gradually entered the mountains, newspaper reporters accidentally found Taiwan’s native mountain cherry near the bamboo lake, which greatly touched Taiwan at that time. The nostalgic feelings of the Japanese, even if the road to the mountain in the early days of the Japanese rule was not perfect, and the cherry blossoms in Taiwan and the home country were not the same, it still drove the cherry blossoms at that time; afterwards, because of the flower viewing and farming activities The intrusion caused the cherry tree to be depleted year by year, and because of the political purpose of promoting the meaning of the rule, the official began to plan to transplant cherry trees in the mountains; while the folks were leisurely and enjoyable, and with the demand of “building the inner landscape”, the rich in the city In the gardens and other public places, there are also many cherry blossoms. [2] When the figure of cherry blossoms became clearer in Taiwanese society and at the same time created an unprecedented cultural atmosphere at all levels, we clearly saw the close relationship between plants and human society. Nowadays, it is difficult to find the cherry trees planted in the urban areas of Taiwan during the Japanese occupation, especially the Yoshino Sakura from Japan's home country. The growth situation has always been bad. [3]
However, plants fail to express their affection and speak pain. Who cares about the closeness between improper transplantation and death?
Kawakami Yumi's transplantation concept
Kawakami Kasumi, a botanist in the Japanese occupation period, served as the technician of the Governor's Office of Taiwan and the curator of the Taiwan Museum. When the Taiwanese official first opened the idea of transplanting the mother country Yoshino Sakura in 1911, he pointed out in the ""Taiwan Daily News"" article:
At the time of transplantation, as far as possible, the original species of sakura, which is suitable for the land of the island, should be transplanted and cultivated as the first, the second Nantou Wushe Sakura, and the end is the mainland cherry. [4]
Even with the feelings of nostalgia and motherland, and the Sakura action has the official mission of promoting long-term colonization and ""permanent residence"" policy, Mr. Kasumi still adheres to the basic understanding of botanists, suggesting that the cultivation of cherry trees should be based on native species. . Looking back at the recent planting of exotic cherry trees in Taiwan, people’s eyes only end on the splendid flower sea. Do you care about the life and death of exotic plants?
The spread of alien plants
As mentioned above, the problem of Yoshino Sakura is the artificial imbalance of the original species, the ecological imbalance of a single species, and the cherry tree itself is not satisfied with the soil and water, and its life span is extremely short. At present, the problems we have seen seem to be limited to the signs of transplantation as a target of transplantation and no outward spread. However, the transplanting of other exotic plants, such as cycads, has brought about extremely serious problems: cycad seedlings imported from Vietnam, white-wheeled shield-scale insects entering Taiwan, iron trees affected by pests, branches and buds are sucked by insects The sap, causing the dead yellow incapable of photosynthesis and death, all over Taiwan, as long as the plants of the cycadaceae can not escape. [5]
Plants that are moved in from outside are easily attached with insect eggs or small insects. When these insects arrive, they will have the opportunity to have unimaginable and even difficult disasters in a new ecological world. Needless to say, the famous Alien invasive species, such as the small flowers, the scented flowers, the scented flowers, and the South American daisy, are extremely strong, spread and grow, and are born in the only land of Taiwan, robbing other natives. The growth space of plants, even animals that are symbiotic with these native plants, is difficult to survive. [6]
Removal of alien invasive species?
Whenever the problem of invasive alien species rises to the surface, it seems to be the most effective way to solve the problem; but what if we are dealing with objects that are not plants, but animals that are alive? Also, if it is an extremely beautiful Egyptian holy shrine? Is it a practice that you and I can accept to remove and cull?
More than 30 years ago, the Egyptian holy shrine was introduced to Taiwan by the folk zoo industry. After that, it escaped due to mismanagement. It quickly proliferated in the wild, and seized the nesting points of native birds and the eggs or young birds eating other birds. Now it has seriously harmed Taiwan. The survival of native birds. In recent years, the Forest Service has attempted to control the ethnic population by removing the nests, eggs and other humane practices, [7] but with limited success. Nowadays, the official invites scholars and experts to discuss and propose to slay the slaying order for the Egyptian holy shrine.
At the time when the awareness of animal protection is gradually rising, the object is such a large and eye-catching bird. The Forest Service has done its homework seriously, including: setting lasso traps, focusing on placement immediately after capture, reducing the time of struggle and various fields. Work practices; in the case of animal euthanasia, they consult a professional veterinarian and refer to the relevant work instructions. Experts and scholars have the following conclusions on the long-term countermeasures against the prevention and control of the Egyptian holy scorpion:
""Invasion of alien species has been recognized as an important mechanism for the loss of biodiversity, and its threat is second only to the destruction of habitats. Some people even believe that alien invasive species are the main cause of habitat loss and the extinction of species."" 8]
Nevertheless, unfortunately, we will face the scene of hurricane; after all, maintaining biodiversity is the current mainstream consciousness, so that the focus of the discussion at this stage has been reduced: how to kill the Egyptian sacred.
Artificial ignorance, but with animals and plants
From the Yoshino Sakura that has appeared around us to the eye-catching Egyptian sacred sacs on the riverbank, why is it always artificial ignorance, or deliberate blindness that only focuses on the interests of human society, leading to the dryness of the cherry trees and the slaughter of the Egyptian holy shrine. why?
Today, most countries' laws, based on the profitability of human society, faintly encourage the introduction of alien species, such as pets, agronomic crops, horticultural crops, and natural enemies for biological control. Therefore, legislation prohibits the introduction of exotic species and maintains biodiversity. [9] Implementing source management to protect animals and plants from artificial death threats is the right way to do things.
