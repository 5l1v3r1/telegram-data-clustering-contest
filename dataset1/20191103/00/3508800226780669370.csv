Din Tai Fung, a famous restaurant chain from Taiwan, is known internationally __＿ its steamed dumplings and high quality services.
(A) as
(B) for
(C) to
(D) in
解答翻譯
正解：(B)
Din Tai Fung, a famous restaurant chain from Taiwan, is known internationally for its steamed dumplings and high quality services.（鼎泰豐，一間來自台灣的著名連鎖餐廳，在國際上以它的小籠包和高品質服務聞名。）
答案詳解
首先，要了解known是know（知道）這個動詞的「過去分詞」，be known可以被解釋為know的「被動式」的變化，表示「被知道」，另外也可以直接把known看成是形容詞「大家都知道的、知名的」。
想要答對這一題，一定要知道be known as、be known for、be known to、be known in的差異喔。

(A) be known as

be known as是「以某身分出名」，as當介係詞時也有「作為、以...的身分」的意思，例如：
Din Tai Fung is known as a classy, high-end Chinese restaurant.（鼎泰豐是以身為優質、高級的中式餐廳而聞名。）

(B) be known for

be known for是「以某特點、長處出名」，像本句中就提到鼎泰豐是以小籠包和高品質服務聞名。再提供大家一個例子：
This region is known for its fine wine.（這個地區以它優質的酒聞名。）

(C) be known to

be known to是「對某人來說是出名的」，to當介係詞時有「按照某人的看法」、「對某人來說」的意思，例如：
Din Tai Fung is known to most of the people in Taiwan.（大部分在台灣的人都知道鼎泰豐。）
另外，be known to後面也可以接「原形動詞」喔，表示「以做了什麼事出名」，例如：
Din Tai Fung is known to serve the best steamed dumplings around the world.（鼎泰豐以供應世界上最美味的小籠包聞名。）

(D) be known in

be known in是「在某地區很出名」，in當介係詞時有「在...之中、在...裡面」的意思，例如：
Din Tai Fung is known in Hong Kong for its one-star award from the Michelin Guide.（因為獲得米其林指南一星評價，鼎泰豐在香港很出名。）
重點單字

famous（形容詞）有名的
chain（名詞）鍊條、連鎖店
restaurant chain（名詞）連鎖餐廳
internationally（副詞）在國際上
high quality service（名詞）高品質的服務
