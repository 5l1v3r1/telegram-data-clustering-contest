Meditating can be very easy and quite hard.
As Ellie Burrows, cofounder and CEO of MNDFL Meditation, explains, “You don't need much to build an at-home practice other than a comfortable place to sit like a chair or couch, your breath and access to quality meditation content.” But Mark Krassner, founder of Expectful meditation app, believes it can also be helpful to create a space for a great meditation practice.
