      <p>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) - A Rockford woman crowned 2019 Miss Illinois County Fair Queen will keep her title but won’t be allowed to perform duties associated with the honor.</p>
      <p>The Illinois Association of Agricultural Fairs, which runs the pageant, said in a Saturday statement that Alexi Bladel will keep the title until January when a successor is named. Her name will remain on a historical roster, but she’s “released” from remaining duties.</p>
      <p>The association declined to give a reason, citing privacy.</p>
      <p>Bladel’s family says her decision to join the U.S. Army Reserves led to the dismissal, but a pageant chairman told the Rockford Register Star it wasn’t a factor. Her family is asking the association to reconsider allowing her to attend next year’s pageant</p>
      <p>Bladel is expected to graduate from basic training this month.</p>
