大家好，歡迎收看《新聞拍案驚奇》，我是大宇。今天是週末，我們出一集「新拍專題」，談一下週末在香港的集會活動。多家媒體報導說，這是香港連續第22個週末舉行抗議活動。 11月2號，香港島有兩場主要集會，一個是愛丁堡廣場的「美國人權法案集氣大會」，一個是遮打花園的「和理摺紙鶴」活動，這兩項活動都獲得了警方發的不反對通知書。 同時，本來也有人發起「維園集會」，主題是「求援國際、堅守自治」，但遭到警方阻止。但是人們堅持聚集，以靈活方式應對，約128名民主派區議會參選人根據《選舉條例》，在維園以每個人少於50人的「選民集會」，進行活動，這不需要警方批准。 入夜，一批示威者快速出現在大陸官方媒體「新華社」在灣仔的亞太總分社辦公樓，破壞玻璃外牆，門口縱火。

Hello everyone, welcome to the ""News Surprise"", I am Daewoo. Today is the weekend. Let's take a look at the ""New Shooting Theme"" and talk about the weekend gatherings in Hong Kong. A number of media reported that this was the 22nd consecutive weekend of protests in Hong Kong. On November 2nd, Hong Kong Island had two major gatherings, one was the ""United States Bill of Rights Gas Conference"" in Edinburgh Square, and the other was the ""Healing Paper Crane"" activity in the Garden. Both activities were obtained by the police. No objection notice. At the same time, some people originally launched the ""Weiyuan Rally"" with the theme of ""seeking assistance from the international community and adhering to self-government"", but it was stopped by the police. However, people insisted on gathering and responded in a flexible manner. About 128 Democratic District Council candidates participated in the ""Electoral Assembly"" of less than 50 people in Victoria Park under the Election Ordinance. This does not require police approval. . At night, a group of demonstrators quickly appeared in the official website of the mainland's official media ""Xinhua News Agency"" in the Asia-Pacific branch office in Wanchai, destroying the glass facade and setting fire at the door.
