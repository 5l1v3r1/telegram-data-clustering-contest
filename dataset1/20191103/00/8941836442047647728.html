      <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Carson Wentz threw for 239 yards and one touchdown, Jordan Howard ran for 82 yards and a score and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> held on for a 22-14 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Chicago Bears</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a> had just 9 yards in the first half and trailed 19-0 before David Montgomery had a pair of 1-yard TD runs to make it a one-possession game in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>But Philadelphia put it away with 16-play, 69-yard drive capped by Jake Elliott’s 38-yard field goal. Wentz completed all four of his third-down passes on the drive for first downs.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> (5-4) have won two in a row after a pair of lopsided losses.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a> (3-5) have lost four straight.</p>

      <p>Mitchell Trubisky was 10 of 21 for 125 yards and was sacked three times.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a> went three-and-out on their first five possessions, gaining minus-10 yards. They didn’t get a first down until the final minute of the first half.</p>
      <p>Wentz connected with Zach Ertz over the middle for a 25-yard touchdown pass to give the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> a 12-0 lead in the second quarter. Elliott missed the extra point wide right.</p>
      <p>Howard ran up the middle 13 yards for a TD on the opening drive of the third quarter, extending the lead to 19-0.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a> finally got going when Trubisky connected with Taylor Gabriel on a 53-yard pass to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> 9 and Montgomery ran in from the 1. He leaped in from the 1 early in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>But Chicago couldn’t complete the comeback.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> had a first down at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a> 5 on their opening drive, but settled for a 28-yard field goal by Elliott after Eddie Goldman sacked Wentz.</p>
        <p>Elliott kicked another 28-yarder on the next drive to make it 6-0.</p>
        <p>FAMILIAR FACES</p>
        <p>Howard averaged 4.3 yards per carry in his first game against his former team. Jeffery had four receptions for 36 yards and at least two drops.</p>
        <p>HEALTHY SCRATCH</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> cornerback Sidney Jones, a second-round pick in 2017, didn’t dress. Jones was projected to be a first-round pick before tearing his Achilles on his pro day. He has failed to live up to expectations in his two-plus seasons.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a>: Goldman (thigh) left in the second quarter. … LB Isaiah Irving (quad) was inactive.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>: WR DeSean Jackson lasted just one series after returning to the lineup for the first time since suffering an abdomen injury in Week 2. He drew a pass interference on the first play and had a 5-yard catch. … LT Jason Peters (knee) and LB Nigel Bradham each missed their third straight game.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bears/">Bears</a>: Host the Lions (3-3-1) next Sunday.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>: Host the Patriots (8-0) on Nov. 17 after a bye.</p>
