Hawaii planning department flooded with rental applications

03 Nov 2019

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) - Officials say the Hawaii County Planning Department has received a significantly higher number of applications for short-term vacation rentals following updates to the rental ordinance.
West Hawaii Today reported Sunday that the department which typically processes about 800 applications annually is working to process almost 4,000 filings.
The county law that went into effect in April prohibits short-term vacation rentals outside of resort zones after the Sept. 30 deadline.
Short-term vacation rentals are defined as properties with less than five bedrooms where the owner does not live that are rented for less than 30 days.
An official says fewer than 300 applications have been closed, with only 66 denied and a small number withdrawn by applicants.


The department says 1,150 of the applications seek exemptions for nonconforming zoning.
