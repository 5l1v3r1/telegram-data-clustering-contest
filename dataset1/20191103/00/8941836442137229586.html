      <h1>Union backs Williams, accuses NFL Network of misinformation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:00:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>The NFL Players Association came to the defense of Washington Redskins tackle <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Trent Williams</a> by accusing the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> Network of using misinformation in an attempt to tarnish the player’s reputation.</p>
      <p>The NFLPA posted a statement on its Twitter account backing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a> and saying it will consider taking action against the league to protect the player’s rights.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a> on Thursday revealed a cancer diagnosis led to him having a tumor removed from his skull played a part in his lengthy holdout and distrust of the team’s medical staff and the organization. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a> said he informed the team of the medical issue six years ago.</p>
      <p>Without mentioning anyone specifically, the NFLPA said the “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s own network” was using unsourced information “designed to tarnish <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Trent</a>’s reputation.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, former Washington general manager and current <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> Network analyst Charley Casserly said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a> was told three years ago that the growth on his head should be tested and added the player never scheduled the procedure. Casserly also suggested <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a>‘ holdout was financially related.</p>

      <p>The union said while it considers its options, it also respects <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a>‘ desire to put the issue behind, and not “relive a painful experience when his life was in danger.”</p>
      <p>The seven-time Pro Bowl selection had multiple surgeries during the offseason related to the tumor’s removal and remained away from the team before reporting this week. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trent-williams/">Williams</a> said it got pretty serious and he was “told some scary things” by doctors that changed his outlook on life.</p>
