Will The Irishman Earn Martin Scorsese His Next Best Picture Oscar?: The Ultimate Debate
Mark Ellis, Angie Han, and Scott Mantz are tackling the big one: How does The Irishman stack up against Scorsese's other films? Who's the movie's MVP? And is Scorsese bound for Oscar glory... again?
03 Nov 2019 by RT Staff



Netflix released Martin Scorsese’s long-anticipated The Irishman into very select theaters this weekend ahead of the film’s digital release on the streaming platform November 27. And so the world is finally getting its first look at the epic three-and-a-half–hour gangster flick that reunites Scorsese favorites Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and also features Al Pacino, starring in a Scorsese picture for the very first time. Critics are loving it so far: The movie is Certified Fresh at 97% on the Tomatometer, and the director and lead cast are all considered sure-things for nominations this awards season. But is this adaptation of I Heard You Paint Houses, the story of gangster Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran and his relationship with union leader Jimmy Hoffa, everything the buzz says it is? That’s the question Mark Ellis is asking critics Scott Mantz and Angie Han (Mashable) in this Irishman deep dive. The panel tackles all the big questions about Netflix’s big Oscar play: Is it Scorsese’s best movie? Who stands out in the cast? Does the movie completely sideline its female cast? And, of course, we ask if this movie will land the legendary director his second Best Picture statuette?
