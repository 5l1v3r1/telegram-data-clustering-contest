TURIN, Nov 3 — Juventus stayed top of Serie A and maintained their winning routine in fixtures against their less glamorous neighbours Torino when a second-half goal from Matthijs de Ligt gave them a 1-0 away win in yesterday’s Derby della Mole.
The 20-year-old Dutchman hooked the ball in following a corner midway through the second half of a scrappy, bad-tempered match.
Bremer had the ball in the net for Torino in stoppage time but it was ruled out for offside.
Juventus, chasing a ninth successive title, lead with 29 points from 11 games, one ahead of Inter Milan who earlier won 2-1 at Bologna. — Reuters
