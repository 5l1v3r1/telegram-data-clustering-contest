中國動畫《哪吒之魔童降世》：在黨的體制下，為國栽培「好」公民
03 Nov 2019 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是中共黨報《人民日報》將哪吒捧為可供效仿的典範人物，以便將來為中國雄霸天下的大業做出貢獻。反諷的是，哪吒為了拯救自己的村子，必須違抗權威，《哪吒之魔童降世》中有關「乖」的定義，顯然與中共的詮釋有所不同。

迪士尼獨霸全球的動畫電影產業有了新挑戰者，那就是來自中國的魔童哪吒。成都可可豆動畫公司產製的《哪吒之魔童降世》是個出人意表的英雄故事。今年7月在中國，8月在澳洲、紐西蘭和北美上映之後，這部電影的票房記錄已高達49.7億人民幣（約等於215億台幣）。這部電影已創下非英語及非美國動畫電影最高票房記錄，同時也贏得中國電影史上第二高的賣座記錄。然而，《哪吒》這部兒童動畫電影不僅是電影史上的奇蹟，它對於時下中國有關如何教養子女和培育公民的議題也有出奇的陳述。

從文學取材的故事
中國的動畫源於1920年代，1950和1960年代曾有一段輝煌時期，後來因文化大革命而告中止。本世紀中國電影製作人得到的資金或贊助日益增多。隨著國家支持力道增強，動畫電影也勢必會愈加茁壯，而類似《哪吒》從中國文學取材的電影也會愈受歡迎。
由鬼才導演餃子執導的《哪吒》，其劇本大致根據16世紀的小説《封神演義》改編，講述力行王道的周武王如何打敗商紂王的奇幻故事。哪吒是個叛逆小子，擁有摧毀性的魔力。當他的爹娘因他惹的禍而須受天庭懲罰時，哪吒決定自我了斷（削骨還父、割肉還母），以免連累他人。後來，他幸得恩師太乙真人協助而復活，變成青少年天神，替周武王作戰。

這齣電影並不是首次以哪吒為主角的作品。1979年的動畫電影《哪吒鬧海》以及2003至2004年播出的兒童電視連續劇《哪吒傳奇》都是先例。不同的是，之前的改編只著重哪吒自我犧牲的自盡，而餃子導演的這部電影則鼓勵年輕人做自己命運的主人。
培養「好」小孩的焦慮
脾氣暴烈，口出惡言的哪吒任誰也無法馴服他。他的爹娘甚為焦急，因爲他與他們理想中乖孩子的期望不符。中文「乖」（guai）一字常被粗略轉譯為「好」（good），其實它是個文化概念，其中包括聽話、懂事及課業良好等。數百年來，這個古老概念一直指引全球華人如何教育孩子的方向。筆者在研究電影和電視如何再現華人的童年時，發現「乖」的意義人言人殊。
華人的父母鼓勵乖孩子變成「有用」人材，可以對家庭、社區和國家有所貢獻。在這同時，父母也會要求子女要自己做決定。小孩必須服從長輩，但也要自作合宜抉擇。哪吒的爹娘指望他成為乖孩子。他們還為如何教養哪吒而起爭執。最後他們誘導哪吒拜師習藝，以便日後和他們一樣，成為斬妖降魔者。他們要哪吒學會自我控制和自我救贖。哪吒的父母希望他的導師能夠馴服自己的兒子。這種渴望與一般中國父母對子女教育的信念相互輝映，亦即，他們咸信教育能引導自己子女成為道德崇高、事業有成的公民。

在中國，子女的養育問題日趨複雜。為人父母者無不期望孩子能在競爭激烈、消費導向的社會出人頭地。同時，他們也覺得有需要灌輸孩子道德價值觀。他們擔心自己教養的孩子缺乏重要的生活技能。
心理學家武志紅指稱中國成年人是「巨嬰」的說法曾引發爭議。依他看來，這些大人不懂如何照顧自己，也無從區分好與壞，簡直是「巨嬰」。就像哪吒的父母一樣，中國的父母心中都有個大問題，亦即如何教養出「好」孩子。而中國共產黨使用的修辭正反映類似的想望。
為國栽培「好」公民
中共黨報《人民日報》將哪吒捧為可供效仿的典範人物。它鼓勵讀者師法哪吒，既有靈活創意，又有堅忍精神。這顯示黨國想要栽培乖乖聽話的「好」公民，以便將來為中國雄霸天下的大業做出貢獻。反諷的是：為了拯救自己的村子，哪吒必須違抗權威：影片中有關「乖」的定義，顯然與中共的詮釋有所不同。哪吒拒絕被自己的命運束縛。他決心自己掌握情況，妥善處理，藉以證明要報效家國，並非只有一條路徑可走。儘管他有無數缺點，哪吒最終是個「乖」孩子。哪吒的抉擇指出，除中共的路線外，尚有另一選項。要乖，不必然要當只為黨利益賣力的好公民：相反地，是要走自己的路。

撇開嚴肅主题不談，這部電影其實相當好看，其中有許多橋段會讓觀眾笑聲連連，還有大量與放屁有關的笑梗，保證年幼觀眾看了會呵呵大笑。有年紀的觀眾看到宿命之戰的特效畫面會感到非常震撼。而有些人甚至會為哪吒與爹娘的親情而感動落淚。沒有人預料到《哪吒》的票房會如此轟動，擁有神奇力量的哪吒是個勇於挑戰權威的好魔童，深受數以百萬計的粉絲喜愛，哪吒做為突然崛起的新超級英雄之地位已然穩固。

Chinese animation ""Where is the devil of the world"": Under the party system, cultivate ""good"" citizens for the country
03 Nov 2019 by Reader's Book


What we want you to know is what the People’s Daily, the CCP’s party newspaper, will hold as a model for imitation, so as to contribute to China’s dominance in the future. The irony is that in order to save his own village, he must defy the authority. The definition of ""乖"" in ""Where the Devil's Child Comes into the World"" is obviously different from the interpretation of the CCP.

Disney has dominated the global animated film industry with new challengers, that is, the magic boy from China. Chengdu's Cocoa Bean Animation Co., Ltd.'s ""The Magical Boys of the World"" is an unexpected hero story. In China in July this year, after the release in Australia, New Zealand and North America in August, the film's box office record has reached 4.97 billion yuan (about equal to 21.5 billion Taiwan dollars). The film has set the highest box office record for non-English and non-American animated films, and has also won the second-highest block record in Chinese film history. However, this children's animated film is not only a miracle in the history of film, but also a surprising statement about China's current issues on how to raise children and nurture citizens.

Story from literature
The animation in China originated in the 1920s. There was a glorious period in the 1950s and 1960s, and it was suspended by the Cultural Revolution. The money or sponsorship of Chinese filmmakers in this century is increasing. As the country's support is strengthened, animated films are bound to grow stronger, and movies like ""Where"" from Chinese literature will become more popular.
The scripture directed by Ghosts directed dumplings, based on the 16th-century novel ""Feng Shen Yan Yi"", describes how Zhou Wuwang, who is the king of power, defeats the fantasy story of Shang Wang. It is a rebellious boy with a destructive magic. When his aunt was to be punished by Heaven for his troubles, he decided to break his own self (cutting the bones and returning the father and cutting the flesh to the mother) so as not to hurt others. Later, he was fortunate to be resurrected by the help of the teacher, Tai Yi, and became a young god, fighting for Zhou Wuwang.

This movie is not the first time to focus on the work. The 1979 animated film ""Where is the sea"" and the children's TV series ""Which Legend"" broadcast from 2003 to 2004 are precedents. The difference is that the previous adaptation focused only on self-sacrifice, and the film directed by Dumpling encouraged young people to be masters of their own destiny.
Cultivate the anxiety of ""good"" children
The temper is violent, and no one can tamed him. His aunt is very anxious because he does not match the expectations of their ideal child. The word ""guai"" is often translated roughly as ""good"". In fact, it is a cultural concept, including obedience, sensibility and good work. For centuries, this ancient concept has been guiding the way Chinese people around the world teach their children. When I studied how movies and television reproduce Chinese childhood, I found that the meaning of ""乖"" is very different.
Chinese parents encourage their children to become ""useful"" people and contribute to the family, the community and the country. At the same time, parents will also ask their children to make their own decisions. Children must obey their elders, but they must make their own choices. The niece of the scorpion is counting on him to become a child. They also argued about how to educate them. In the end, they induced the apprentices to learn, so that they would become the demon and demons in the future. Where do they want to learn to control themselves and redeem themselves. Hey parents want his mentor to tame their son. This desire and the belief of the average Chinese parents in their children's education reflect each other, that is, their ethical education can guide their children to become morally noble and successful citizens.

In China, the problem of raising children is becoming more and more complicated. Parents hope that children can make a difference in a highly competitive, consumer-oriented society. At the same time, they also feel the need to instill children's moral values. They are worried that their children will lack important life skills.
The argument that psychologist Wu Zhihong alleged that Chinese adults are ""giant infants"" has caused controversy. In his view, these adults do not know how to take care of themselves, and they cannot distinguish between good and bad. They are simply ""giant infants."" Just like the parents, there is a big problem in Chinese parents, that is, how to raise a ""good"" child. The rhetoric used by the Communist Party of China reflects similar hopes.
Cultivating ""good"" citizens for the country
The People’s Daily, the CCP’s party newspaper, will be the model person to be emulated. It encourages readers to practice the law, both flexible and resilient. This shows that the party state wants to cultivate a ""good"" citizen who is obedient, so as to contribute to the great cause of China's dominance in the future. The irony is that in order to save one's own village, it must be against the authority: the definition of ""乖"" in the film is obviously different from the interpretation of the CCP. I refuse to be bound by my own destiny. He is determined to master the situation and properly handle it, so as to prove that it is necessary to serve the country, there is not only one path to go. Although he has countless shortcomings, he is ultimately a ""squatting"" child. The choice of which point indicates that there is another option besides the CCP’s route. It is not necessary to be a good citizen who only works for the interests of the party: on the contrary, it is to take its own path.

Regardless of the serious theme, this movie is actually quite beautiful. There are many bridges that will make the audience laugh and laugh, and there are a lot of laughter related to fart, to ensure that the young audience will laugh. Older viewers will be shocked to see the special effects screen of the fateful battle. And some people may even be moved to tears for the family relationship with the mother. No one expected that the box office of ""Where"" would be so sensational. The magical power is a good magic boy who dares to challenge the authority. It is loved by millions of fans, and it is a new superhero who suddenly rises. The status has been stabilized.
