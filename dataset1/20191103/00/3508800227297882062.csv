所有國家都是家暴施暴者的溫床，但只有美國讓他們輕鬆取得槍枝與彈藥

拉希亞．克蕾頓（La’Shea Cretain）剛餵完她四個月大的女兒，這時她的前男友突然出現在她位於路易斯安那州奧珀盧薩斯（Opelousas, La.）的家中，朝她的頭部開槍後便舉槍自盡。當時年僅18歲的克蕾頓倒在大門口，距離她襁褓中的女兒和剛學會走路的兒子僅有幾步之遙。
二十三年後，克蕾頓仍因五顆卡在她身體裡（其中一顆在脊椎裡）的子彈而飽受慢性疼痛和背部疾病所苦。更不用說她和孩子們（他們在成長的過程中知道母親差點在他們面前被殺害）自1996年10月3日的槍擊事件後就必須去克服的情緒創傷。現年41歲、擔任槍枝暴力預防倡議者的克蕾頓表示：「我們永遠不會再是過去的自己了，這種事會跟著我們一輩子。」
研究顯示，如今美國有近一百萬名倖存於槍擊事件的婦女共享著克蕾頓的經歷。然而，在克蕾頓被開槍的逾二十年後，就家暴或由親密伴侶在家庭外所施加的暴力而言，美國婦女與孩童並沒有比較安全——而這很大程度上與槍枝有關。研究指出，由親密伴侶所犯下、涉及槍枝的殺人事件正逐漸增加，而利用其他武器的案件（例如刀械）正在減少。一份三月份的研究發現，2010至2017年間，涉及槍枝使用的親密伴侶殺人案增加了26%。
據槍枝控管團體「城市支持槍枝安全」（Everytown for Gun Safety）週四（編按：本文原發表於10月17日）公布的最新數據，2009至2018年間喪生於大型槍擊事件（其定義為除了槍手外，至少有四人喪生的槍擊事件）的孩童中，有80%與家庭或親密伴侶暴力有關。警方表示，在近期一起震驚社會的「殺人後自殺事件」中，一名麻薩諸塞州的男子在槍殺自己的妻子和三個小孩——分別為11歲的女兒和一對9歲的雙胞胎——後舉槍自盡。這一家五口最終被發現陳屍在麻州艾賓頓（Abington, Mass.）的家中。
「城市支持槍枝安全」研究部主任莎拉．柏德－夏普斯（Sarah Burd-Sharps）表示：「毫無疑問，擁有槍枝在這其中扮演非常重要的角色。這個嚴重的議題正影響著所有家庭，尤其是下一代，我們真的必須好好掌控它。」
一篇2017年美國疾病管制與預防中心（Centers for Disease Control and Prevention）的研究稱，殺人事件的所有女性罹難者中，有近半的人是死於現任或前任親密伴侶之手。槍枝管控倡議者也表示，美國的黑人女性被親密伴侶槍殺的比率是白人女性的兩倍，而年輕黑人女性被親密伴侶槍殺的機率，是同年齡層白人女性的三倍。據「全國家庭暴力熱線」（National Domestic Violence Hotline）指出，平均而言，美國每分鐘會有24人淪為遭到親密伴侶性侵害、肢體暴力或跟蹤行為的受害者。2018年，該熱線接到的電話和訊息是自1996年創立以來最多的一年。
槍枝管控倡議團體「媽媽反槍行動聯盟」（Moms Demand Action）創辦人莎南．華特茲（Shannon Watts）說道：「所有國家都是家暴施暴者的溫床，但只有美國讓他們輕鬆取得槍枝和彈藥。」據華特茲的說法，美國婦女死於槍殺的比率較其他高收入國家多出21倍。她表示：「槍枝在美國太容易取得了，當你把家庭暴力和槍枝結合在一起，一切就變得更加致命。」
所有國家都是家暴施暴者的溫床，但只有美國讓他們輕鬆取得槍枝和彈藥。
就算從未開過，但槍枝無論如何都是施暴者的工具。喬凡娜．羅德里格茲（Giovanna Rodriguez）跟前夫在一起的每一天都生活在恐懼之中，她說前夫總是不斷嚷嚷著自己有帶槍能隨時殺了她。她表示：「無論我們是要去公園、博物館、海邊，那支槍永遠在那。我自己也必須隨時帶著槍，以作為嚇阻的手段。」
週四關於槍枝和親密伴侶暴力的研究發現與今年發表的其他相關研究立場一致。其中一項研究發現，親密伴侶殺人案在持續下降了近四十年後，現在因為槍枝的關係正漸漸上升；一項一月的研究發現，根據來自16個州的數據，近三分之二於親密伴侶暴力事件中喪生的兒童是肇因於槍枝；另一項研究發現，擁有槍枝的比率與家庭殺人事件有關，但與其他槍殺事件（例如持槍搶劫）無關。
槍枝控管倡議者和家暴倖存者表示，儘管有越來越多證據顯示擁槍率的增加已經嚴重危及生活在家暴家庭中的婦女與孩童，但法律仍未與時俱進到足以解決這個獨特問題的地步。柏德-夏普斯表示：「在美國，親密伴侶暴力殺人案的比率高得不可原諒，而我們明明就知道該怎麼樣才能保護婦女。」
研究人員也發現，所謂「紅旗法案」（red flag laws），或是極端風險法案（extreme risk laws），或許能避免某些殺人事件（包含自殺）的發生。加州大學戴維斯分校（University of California Davis School）醫學院近期的一項研究引用了21個案例，這些案例均利用了加州的這種法案來避免潛在的大型槍擊事件在州內發生。其他研究發現，「紅旗法案」使得康乃狄克州和印第安那州內與槍枝有關的自殺比率降低，而這兩個州也包含在全美擁有這類法律措施的至少十七個州之中。近期，一位研究目的在於檢驗家庭殺人事件與非家庭殺人事件比率差異的第一作者艾倫．奇維斯托（Aaron Kivisto）說道：「我們有充分的合理理由，認為這些沒收槍枝的法案能對減少伴侶殺人的案件帶來影響。」
在現行的聯邦法律之下，如果家暴施暴者是家暴限制令的對象或是他們被裁定犯有某些罪刑，他們就會被禁止擁有槍枝。但該法律僅適用於那些現在或曾經是配偶，或曾住在一起，或一起有過小孩的人。它並不包含約會伴侶（dating partner），這個缺失有時候被稱為「男友的漏洞」（boyfriend loophole）。《反婦女暴力法案》（Violence Against Women Act，簡稱VAWA。該法律於1994年通過，旨在幫助家暴和性暴力受害者）的新條款將有助於防止那些曾因虐待、攻擊或跟從現任或前任約會伴侶而被定罪的人購買或擁有槍枝。然而，《反婦女暴力法案》每隔幾年就需要經由國會的重新批准，現在眾議院已經完成批准，但參議院尚未更新。
倡議者表示，在毫無作為的情況下，估計每天將持續有三名婦女被親密伴侶殺害。克蕾頓則希望能透過告訴大家她的經歷來拯救至少一位受害者。在中槍的兩個月前，當她的前男友開始在她工作的地方跟蹤她，克蕾頓驚慌了，她選擇告訴警察前男友曾經虐待她。她知道他有槍，並認為自己的家人身處危險之中。但在警方紀錄完她的控訴之後，她表示一切都沒有改變。
她說道：「我深深相信，若是當時的執法單位有這些方法可資運用，我就不需要受這五顆子彈所帶來的痛苦了。」

All countries are hotbeds of domestic violence, but only the United States allows them to easily obtain guns and ammunition

Rahia. La'Shea Cretain had just fed her four-month-old daughter, when her ex-boyfriend suddenly appeared in her home in Opelousas, La., towards her. After the gun was fired, the gun was shot. At the time, Clayton, who was only 18 years old, fell to the gate, only a few steps away from her daughter and her son who had just learned to walk.
Twenty-three years later, Clayton was still suffering from chronic pain and back problems due to five bullets stuck in her body (one of them in the spine). Not to mention that she and the children (who grew up knowing that the mother was almost killed in front of them) had to overcome the emotional trauma since the shooting on October 3, 1996. Clayton, 41, who is the advocate of gun violence prevention, said: ""We will never be the past ourselves again. This kind of thing will follow us forever.""
Studies have shown that nearly one million women who survived the shooting incident in the United States today share the experience of Clayton. However, more than twenty years after Clayton was shot, American women and children were not safer in terms of domestic violence or violence imposed by intimate partners outside the home – and this is largely due to Related to guns. Studies have shown that murders involving intimate partners and involving guns are increasing, while cases using other weapons (such as tools) are decreasing. A March study found that between 2010 and 2017, intimate partner homicides involving gun use increased by 26%.
According to the latest data released by the firearms control group ""Everytown for Gun Safety"" on Thursday (edited: originally published on October 17th), a large-scale shooting incident was killed between 2009 and 2018. Eighty percent of the children defined as shooting incidents with at least four deaths besides the gunmen are related to family or intimate partner violence. The police said that in a recent ""suicide suicide"" that shocked society, a Massachusetts man was shooting his wife and three children - 11-year-old daughter and 9-year-old twins respectively. - After the gun is self-defeating. The family of five was eventually found dead in the home of Abington, Mass.
Sarah, Director of Research Department of ""City Support Gun Safety"". Sarah Burd-Sharps said: ""There is no doubt that having a gun plays a very important role in this. This serious issue is affecting all families, especially the next generation. We really have to be good. Take control of it.""
A 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that nearly half of all female victims of homicides died in the hands of current or former intimate partners. The gun control proponents also said that black women in the United States were shot twice as many as white women by intimate partners, while young black women were three times more likely to be shot by intimate partners than white women of the same age. According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, on average, 24 people per minute in the United States are victims of intimate partner sexual assault, physical violence or follow-up. In 2018, the hotline received the most calls and messages since its inception in 1996.
Shanan, the founder of the Moms Demand Action, the gun control initiative group. Shannon Watts said: ""All countries are hotbeds of domestic violence, but only the United States allows them to easily obtain guns and ammunition."" According to Waltz, the rate of American women dying from shooting is higher than other High-income countries are 21 times more. She said: ""The guns are so easy to get in the United States. When you combine domestic violence with guns, everything becomes even more deadly.""
All countries are hotbeds of domestic violence, but only the United States allows them to easily obtain guns and ammunition.
Even if it has never been opened, the guns are tools of the perpetrator anyway. Giovanna. Giovanna Rodriguez lives in fear every day with her ex-husband. She says that her ex-husband is always licking her own guns to kill her at any time. She said: ""Whether we are going to the park, museum, or the sea, the gun will always be there. I must always wear a gun as a means of deterrence.""
A Thursday study on guns and intimate partner violence found consistency with other related research positions published this year. One of the studies found that intimate partner homicides have continued to decline for nearly forty years, and now the relationship between guns is gradually rising; a January study found that, based on data from 16 states, nearly three-thirds Second, children who lost their lives in intimate partner violence were caused by guns; another study found that the rate of possession of guns was related to family killings, but not to other shooting incidents (such as gun robbery).
Gun control advocates and survivors of domestic violence said that although there is increasing evidence that the increase in gun ownership has seriously jeopardized women and children living in domestic violence families, the law has not been able to keep up with the times. The point of this unique problem. ""The ratio of intimate partner violent homicides is unforgivable in the United States, and we know exactly how to protect women,"" said Bader Sharps.
The researchers also found that the so-called ""red flag laws"" or extreme risk laws may prevent certain killings (including suicide) from happening. A recent study by the University of California Davis School of Medicine cited 21 cases that used California's bill to avoid potential large-scale shooting incidents in the state. Other studies have found that the Red Flag Act has reduced the rate of suicide-related suicides in Connecticut and Indiana, and these two states are among at least seventeen states in the United States that have such legal measures. Recently, one study aimed to test the difference between the ratio of family homicides to non-family homicides, Allen. Aaron Kivisto said: ""We have good reason to believe that these confiscation laws can affect the reduction of partner homicide cases.""
Under current federal law, if domestic violence perpetrators are the subject of domestic violence restrictions or if they are found guilty of certain crimes, they will be banned from possession of guns. But the law only applies to those who are or have been spouses, have lived together, or have had children together. It does not include a dating partner, which is sometimes referred to as a boyfriend loophole. The new provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA, adopted in 1994 to help victims of domestic violence and sexual violence) will help prevent those who have been abused, attacked or inherited A person convicted of a former dating partner who purchased or possessed a gun. However, the Anti-Women Violence Act needs to be re-approved by Congress every few years, and now the House of Representatives has completed the approval, but the Senate has not been updated.
The proponents stated that in the absence of action, it is estimated that three women will continue to be killed by intimate partners every day. Clayton hopes to save at least one victim by telling everyone about her experiences. Two months before the gunshot, when her ex-boyfriend began to follow her at the place where she worked, Clayton panicked and she chose to tell the police that her ex-boyfriend had abused her. She knew that he had a gun and that his family was in danger. But after the police recorded her complaint, she said that nothing has changed.
She said: ""I deeply believe that if the law enforcement agencies at the time had these methods available, I would not need the pain of the five bullets.""
