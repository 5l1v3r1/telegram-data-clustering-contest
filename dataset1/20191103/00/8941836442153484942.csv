MILWAUKEE (AP) - Prosecutors allege a Milwaukee man painted his car after a hit-and-run crash that killed two young sisters.
Nineteen-year-old Daetwan Robinson was charged Friday in the Oct. 24 crash that killed the girls and seriously injured their 10-year-old cousin.
According to the complaint, surveillance video shows Robinson’s car fishtailing and on only two wheels just before the crash.
Authorities say Robinson pulled around several other cars stopped at a red light and struck the children in the crosswalk. Six-year-old Lisa Gee died at the scene. Her 4-year-old sister, Amea Gee, later died at a hospital.
Police arrested Robinson the next day at his home. Investigators found the car in the garage along with cans of black spray paint.
