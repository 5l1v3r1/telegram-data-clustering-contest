Support to BJP is conditional, not joining them to share power: HD Kumaraswamy
03 Nov 2019, 00:30 by Bangalore Mirror Bureau
I neither intend to embrace BJP nor Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa,” said former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy at an interaction programme organised by the Bangalore Reporter’s Guild and the Press Club of Bangalore on Saturday. The JD(S) leader predicted a hung Assembly even if there is a mid-term election. On his comment not to allow the BJP government fall, Kumaraswamy said, “People are suffering from the rain and the recent floods. Thousands were displaced. If the government does a good job, I will stand with it, even if it is a Congress government.’’ He, however, ruled out any alliance with the BJP. Kumaraswamy also denied that several pending cases were reasons for his softening stand on the BJP government. “I stayed away from the BJP despite an offer by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. My father was upset with my eardecision to go with the BJP in 2006,’’ he said. He denied reports of JD(S) legislators deserting the party. “I am not taking legislators to Malaysia or any other country. I am going to England to discuss the film project of my son Nikhil,” he said.
