      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - A community vigil, art workshops and a poetry-writing workshop are among many peace-themed events aimed at promoting non-violence during “Baltimore Ceasefire” weekend.</p>
      <p>The first ceasefire weekend was held in 2017 by organizers who urged that it be seen as a 72-hour period when no murders are committed in violence-plagued Baltimore. The weekends are held every three months.</p>
      <p>The hopes of Erricka Bridgeford and other founders of the ceasefire weekends are often dashed as they were Saturday afternoon when two men were shot. A 24-year-old man was pronounced dead, becoming Baltimore’s 286th homicide victim of the year.</p>
      <p>The ceasefire weekends do seem to have some effect. The Baltimore Sun reports that a study conducted by Bridgeford’s organization found that there was an average 52 percent reduction in shootings on ceasefire weekends.</p>
