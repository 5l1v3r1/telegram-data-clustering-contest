      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-gordon/">Gordon</a> had exercised his part of the option but was allowed to go free Saturday. He will receive a $4 million buyout, completing a $72 million, four-year contract he agreed to in January 2016.</p>

      <p>He batted .266 this year with 13 homers and 76 RBIs for the rebuilding Royals, who topped 100 losses for the second straight season. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alex-gordon/">Gordon</a> is a career .258 hitter with 186 homers and 738 RBIs.</p>
