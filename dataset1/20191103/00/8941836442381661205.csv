2 candidates get endorsements for state monument designation

03 Nov 2019

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Gov. Gary Herbert’s office has endorsed the first two designations for new state monument candidates, but they will need approval by Utah lawmakers.
The Deseret News reports Danger Cave State Park Heritage Area near the Nevada border and Old Iron Town in Iron County received unanimous legislative endorsement by the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Committee last month.
The committee will draft a concurrent resolution that will need the support of the full Legislature.
Danger Cave is one of North America’s most significant archaeological sites, once home to artifacts and relics detailing the history of Native Americans as far back as 11,000 years ago.
Old Iron Town was home to several hundred residents in early statehood history as pioneers tried to hold onto their independence from the federal government.
