我們想讓你知道的是在提到他心中較為理想的政治家形象時，導演也說，有些政客常常在亂說大話之後又反悔，再不然就是會拐著彎把自己錯誤的所作所為全都正當化，讓人覺得你要不就乖乖閉嘴，再不然就是直率一點，這樣反而還讓人痛快些。



文：Waiting，本名劉韋廷，曾獲某文學獎，譯有某些小說，曾為某流行媒體總編輯，近日常以「出前一廷」之名於部分媒體撰寫電影相關文章。個人FB粉絲頁：史蒂芬金銀銅鐵席格
場景突然一暗，畫面上唯一的光線，只剩下照在主角身上的一盞聚光燈。與在黑暗中凝止不動的其他角色不同，身為警察的主角轉身面對鏡頭，打破了第四道牆，開始對電視外面的我們說話，內容除了向我們遞出挑戰書，詢問我們是否像他一樣，已從前面的情節中察覺出犯人的罪行破綻，同時更往往不忘給出一個具有獨特幽默感的暗示。
電視中那名主角由田村正和飾演，劇名則與角色名字一樣，叫做《古畑任三郎》。在這部經典的推理劇系列裡，飾演過犯人的卡司，前後包括了中森明菜、唐澤壽明、山口智子、明石家秋刀魚、真田廣之、福山雅治、松嶋菜菜子，甚至是SMAP全體成員與棒球選手鈴木一朗等人。至於劇本，則全數由三谷幸喜撰寫，也成為了許久以前的我，對三谷幸喜作品所留下的最初印象。
後來，三谷幸喜多了電影導演的身分，更藉由《有頂天大飯店》與《魔幻時刻》的大獲成功，使他開始受到不少台灣影迷的矚目，尤其是《魔幻時刻》，更憑藉了幽默與熱情並俱的精采劇本，還有佐藤浩市某段你絕對不能錯過的「一刀三舔」演出，讓人再度感受到三谷幸喜作品的驚人樂趣。
日前，三谷幸喜帶著他的最新電影《失憶的總理大臣》再度造訪台灣，與我們一同聊聊關於這部電影，以及與創作有關的一些事情。這部電影的劇情，描述史上民調最低、個性惡劣的總理大臣，一日被抗議民眾用石頭砸中導致失憶，他的秘書為了不讓國事大亂，因此選擇隱瞞真相，使失去記憶導致性情大變，意外成為好好先生的總理只得硬著頭皮，想辦法面對眾多爭權奪利的政客，以及他過往的荒謬作為，因而引發了一連串叫人意想不到的事件⋯⋯
雖然從電影來看是第一次，但要是把範圍擴大到電視劇，那麼《失憶的總理大臣》則並非三谷幸喜首度挑戰現代政治喜劇。早在1997年時，由他撰寫劇本的日劇《別叫我總理》（総理と呼ばないで），便與《失憶的總理大臣》有著一些類似的前提設定。而這兩部擁有相近血統的戲劇，對於身為創作者的三谷導演來說，最大的不同又是什麼呢？
回憶起《別叫我總理》，三谷表示，當時日本其實較少看到喜劇類型的電視劇，大部分的觀眾比較喜歡感人落淚之類的溫馨作品，而《別叫我總理》又是一部題材比較硬派的喜劇，因此在許多地方都算是一種挑戰之舉。反而到了這次的《失憶的總理大臣》中，走的是較為溫暖的路線，這點其實是兩部作品相當有趣的對比。
至於角色創作方面，三谷則進一步表示，在《別叫我總理》中，雖然每一集的最後，由田村正和飾演的總理看起來都像是有所改變，但是到了下一集時，基本上都會變成原來的模樣，算是一個其實並未成長的角色。但在《失憶的總理大臣》裡，由中井貴一飾演的黑田總理，則是以失憶作為契機，在故事發展的過程中不斷有所成長，這點則是這兩部作品的另一個最大不同之處。
如果你曾看過《失憶的總理大臣》預告，便會發現片中仍未失憶時的黑田總理，其言行舉止確實會讓人想到台灣的某些政治人物。而在與三谷導演聊到這一點時，他則表示，這個角色並沒有任何參考人物，因為在日本從來沒有那種會對民眾出言不遜的總理。「但有一點不可思議的是，有些日本觀眾在看完電影後，會覺得原本那個言行惡劣的黑田總理很有魅力。」
關於這點，他又進一步解釋：「他們認為，雖然那個角色確實十分差勁，但也是個相當直率的人，想說什麼就說什麼，因此也讓那些觀眾希望能看到更多失憶前的總理戲份。」
這一點或許與日本及台灣的政治文化不同有關。在提到他心中較為理想的政治家形象時，導演也說，有些政客常常在亂說大話之後又反悔，再不然就是會拐著彎把自己錯誤的所作所為全都正當化，讓人覺得你要不就乖乖閉嘴，再不然就是直率一點，這樣反而還讓人痛快些。「不過，這也不代表說話直率就可以顛倒是非，錯的當然還是錯的，只是如果能有一個真正敢作敢當的政治家存在，還是會比較好的。」



不過，既然片名是《失憶的總理大臣》，電影自然還是以失憶後的黑田總理作為發展核心，對於失憶前那個惡劣的總理行徑，則大多是透過其他角色之口來描述的。「會這樣安排，是因為黑田這個角色在失憶之後，只能透過別人的形容與對他的反應，來慢慢得知自己原本是怎樣的人。因此會用這種處理方式，是因為我希望觀眾能跟他站在相同的角度來了解這些事情，因而更能感同身受，同時理解這部電影最大的主題——也就是人不管到了幾歲，都還是能有所改變的。」
《失憶的總理大臣》承繼了三谷導演的電影特質，除了有中井貴一、田中圭、佐藤浩市等過往合作過的演員外，也有著像石田百合子與藤岡靛這些首度合作的演員，維持了過往總是給人偏好描寫群戲的印象。「會喜歡寫群戲的主要原因其實很單純，」被問到這點時，三谷這麼回答。「因為日本實在有太多的優秀演員了，讓我總是會想把他們全都放到戲中，藉此跟許多優秀演員合作。」
所以在寫劇本時，便會設定好要找哪個演員來演？若是檔期無法配合呢？「設定演員的部份其實還要更早。我通常都會先構思大綱，然後去想要找哪個演員來演，等到演員也確定檔期後，才會真的開始撰寫腳本，所以不會遇到得要修改劇本或換角等問題。」
而在三谷電影中的豪華卡司，其實也有不少人是透過舞台劇與他結緣的。像是透過話題日劇《大叔之愛》人氣竄升，在《失憶的總理大臣》也有搞笑演出的田中圭，便是這樣的例子之一。事實上，作品以舞台劇居多的三谷，就連在執導電影時，也常常透過像是長鏡頭的運用，讓觀眾從銀幕上感受到舞台劇般的氛圍。
「我大概一年會產出兩部舞台劇，電影則是兩到三年一部。」他說。「由於我是從舞台劇出身的，同時也拍攝電影，因此對舞台劇與電影的優點還算是略知一二，所以會特別想創作出融合兩者優點的作品。身為電影導演來說，如何好好地發揮出演員的優點，就是一件需要好好思考的事。因此，在電影中運用長鏡頭，便比較能突顯出演員的表現，同時也會具有接近舞台劇的效果。」
然而，除了舞台劇與影視創作外，三谷其實也寫過小說，有的甚至與他的影視作品有關。像是《清須會議》的小說版本，便早於電影發行，而《古畑任三郎》則是曾推出過一部名為《古畑任三郎殺人事件ファイル》的短篇集（台灣中譯本書名沿用了《古畑任三郎》第二部的中譯劇名《新紳士刑警》，並與日本平裝本相同，拆為兩本上市，中譯本目前已經絕版），書中收錄的均為原創故事，與電視劇版本完全不同。對他來說，小說與劇本創作最大的不同又是什麼呢？
「其實我並沒有那麼喜歡寫小說，」他相當坦率地表示。「因為寫小說是獨自一人完成的事，而電影或舞台劇，則需要集眾人之力一起完成。」他表示，當初會寫《古畑任三郎殺人事件ファイル》，其實只是因為相關單位想把劇本小說化時，通常都會找其他作家來改寫，但由於他個人不太喜歡這樣，因此才決定由自己撰寫為小說版本創造新的故事。至於《清須會議》的小說，則更是為了電影而生。「當時我們已經在企劃電影了，是在討論要不要做一些比較不同的宣傳手法時，才想到可以先把故事寫成小說，然後再來拍攝電影，以此作為宣傳手法。」
也因為這樣，三谷認為，自己對小說創作的了解程度，並不足以去談兩者之間有何不同。「硬要說的話，如果用現在這個情境來舉例，那麼在劇本的情況裡，第一行就會是『一名導演正在接受採訪』，剩下的視覺部分，就是齊心協力的事情了。但要是寫小說的話，就還得去描述人物外觀或場景之類的細節，好讓讀者在腦中勾勒出整個空間的樣貌。所以就這點來說，也是我覺得寫小說很困難的地方。」他又進一步補充。「而且，也不是把所有東西都描述出來就會是好小說，所以其實我到現在，都還不知道該怎樣才能寫出一本好小說。」
聊到這裡，訪談的時間也到了尾聲。最後，還是得不免俗地問一下三谷導演，有沒有什麼特別想對台灣觀眾表示的？
「去年我有一部舞台劇在台灣公演，所以包括那次與更早之前造訪台灣時，我都有稍微觀察一下台灣觀眾的反應。」他認為，台灣的觀眾很懂得享受戲劇，總是能夠樂在其中。有時，他甚至還會覺得台灣的觀眾更能感受到他所想表達的事情，因此也讓他很開心能帶著《失憶的總理大臣》一片再度造訪台灣。
「像我之前在拍攝《銀河街道》與《清須會議》時，過程中也會突然想到，不知道台灣的觀眾看到會有什麼感覺。所以這次在寫《失憶的總理大臣》時，自己偶爾也會想到，啊，台灣的觀眾應該會覺得這次的作品還不錯吧。」

Interview with Sangu Yuki, talk about his ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"" and creation
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by Readmoo reading the front line


What we want you to know is that when referring to the ideal politician image in his heart, the director also said that some politicians often repent after talking loudly, otherwise they will turn their corners and make all their mistakes. Justification makes people feel that you are going to shut up, or else you are straightforward, which makes you feel more happy.



Text: Waiting, whose real name is Liu Weiting, has won a literary award. He has translated some novels. He used to be the editor-in-chief of a popular media. He wrote about film-related articles in some media in the name of “Before a Court”. Personal FB fan page: Steven Gold, Silver, Copper and Iron
The scene suddenly darkened, the only light on the screen, leaving only a spotlight on the main character. Unlike other characters who do not move in the dark, the protagonist of the police turned to face the camera, broke the fourth wall, and began to speak to us outside the TV. In addition to asking us questions, we asked if we were like Like him, he has been aware of the crimes of the prisoners from the previous plots, and often does not forget to give a hint with a unique sense of humor.
The protagonist on TV is played by Masahiro Tamura, and the title of the play is the same as the name of the character. In this classic series of reasoning dramas, the actor who plays the prisoner includes Zhongsen Mingcai, Tang Zeshou Ming, Yamaguchi Tomoko, Akashi Akita, Sanada Hiroyuki, Fukuyama Masaharu, Matsuzaka, and even SMAP members and baseball players. Suzuki Ichi and others. As for the script, all of them were written by Miyuki Miyuki, and it was also the first impression I made on the work of Mitani Yuki.
Later, Mitani was more than a film director, and with the success of ""The Top Hotel"" and ""Magic Moment"", he began to attract the attention of many Taiwanese fans, especially ""Magic Moment"". The splendid scripts of humor and enthusiasm, as well as the ""one knife, three slaps"" performances you can't miss in a certain section of Sato, make people feel the amazing fun of Miku Yuki.
A few days ago, Sangu Yuki took his latest movie ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"" to visit Taiwan again, and talked with us about this movie and some things related to creation. The plot of the film depicts the Prime Minister, who has the lowest polls and bad personality in history. One day, the protesters used the stone to cause amnesia. His secretary chose to conceal the truth in order to prevent the state from being chaotic, so that losing his memory leads to disposition. The big change, the accident became a good Mr. Prime Minister had to bite his head, trying to face many politicians who fought for power and the ridiculous acts of his past, which led to a series of unexpected events.
Although it is the first time from the movie, if the scope is extended to the TV series, then the ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"" is not the first time that Sangu is pleased to challenge modern political comedy. As early as 1997, he wrote a script for the Japanese TV drama ""Don't call me Prime Minister"" (総理と呼ばないで), and it has some similar premise settings with the ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"". And what are the biggest differences between the two films with similar pedigrees for the creator of Sangu?
Recalling ""Don't call me Prime Minister"", Sangu said that at that time, Japan actually saw less comedy-type TV dramas. Most of the audience liked the warm works like touching tears, and ""Don't call me Prime Minister"" is another one. The comedy of hard-core themes is therefore a challenge in many places. Instead, in this ""Minister of Amnesia"", it is a warmer route. This is actually a very interesting comparison between the two works.
As for the role creation, Mitani further stated that in the ""Don't call me Prime Minister"", although the final of each episode, the Prime Minister played by Tamura Masaru seems to have changed, but in the next episode, basically It will become the original appearance, which is a character that has not actually grown. However, in the Prime Minister of Amnesia, the Prime Minister of Kuroda, played by Nakai, is an opportunity to lose memory as a turning point in the development of the story. This is another biggest difference between the two works. Where.
If you have read the ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"" notice, you will find that Prime Minister Kuroda has not yet lost his memory. His words and deeds really make people think of some political figures in Taiwan. When talking about this with the director of Sangu, he said that this role does not have any reference characters, because there has never been a prime minister in Japan who is not vocal. ""But it is incredible that some Japanese viewers will feel that the original Prime Minister Kuroda is very attractive after watching the movie.""
In this regard, he further explained: ""They think that although the role is really bad, but it is also a fairly straightforward person, what do you want to say, so that the audience hope to see more prime ministers before amnesia Play.""
This may be related to the different political cultures of Japan and Taiwan. When referring to the image of a more ideal politician in his heart, the director also said that some politicians often repent after talking loudly, or they would just turn around and justify what they have done wrong. If you just shut up, or else you are straightforward, it will make you feel better. ""However, this does not mean that speaking frankly can reverse the right and wrong. Of course, the mistake is still wrong, but it would be better if there was a politician who really dared to be a daring.""



However, since the title of the film is ""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"", the film is naturally based on the late development of Prime Minister Kuroda as the core of development. For the bad Prime Minister's actions before amnesia, most of them are described through the mouths of other characters. ""This arrangement is because the character of Kuroda can only slowly learn what kind of person he is by reading the reaction of others and his reaction to him. Therefore, this method is used because of me. I hope that the audience can understand these things from the same angle as him, and therefore feel more empathetic, and understand the biggest theme of the film - that is, people can change regardless of their age.""
""The Prime Minister of Amnesia"" inherits the film characteristics of the director of Sangu. In addition to the actors who have cooperated in the past, such as Nakajima, Tanaka, and Sato, there are actors who have cooperated for the first time like Ishida Yuriko and Fujioka, and have maintained the past. Always give people the impression of a description of the group play. ""The main reason why I like to write a group play is actually very simple."" When asked about this, Sangu answered this. ""Because there are so many excellent actors in Japan, I always want to put them all in the play and cooperate with many excellent actors.""
So when writing a script, will you set which actor to play for? If the schedule can not be matched? ""It's actually earlier to set up the actor. I usually think about the outline first, then go to the actor who wants to find it. After the actor has decided the schedule, I will actually start writing the script, so I won't encounter it. To modify the script or change the corner, etc.""
In the luxury movie in the Three Valley movie, there are actually many people who are attached to him through the stage play. Such as through the topic of the Japanese TV drama ""Uncle's Love"" soaring, Tian Zhonggui, who also has a funny performance in the ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"", is one such example. In fact, the three valleys in which the works are mostly staged, even when directing movies, often use the use of long-lens to let the audience feel the stage-like atmosphere from the screen.
""I will produce two stage plays in a year, and the film will be two to three years,"" he said. ""Because I was born from a stage play and filmed at the same time, I still know a little about the advantages of stage play and film, so I would like to create a work that combines the advantages of both. As a film director, how is it good? The advantage of being an actor is something that needs to be considered well. Therefore, using a long shot in a movie can highlight the performance of the actor and also have the effect of approaching the stage play.""
However, in addition to stage plays and film and television creations, Sangu actually wrote novels, and some even related to his film and television works. For example, the novel version of the ""Qingshou Conference"" was published earlier than the film, and ""Gu Yulan Saburo"" has published a short collection called ""The Story of the Ancient Shuro Saburo Killing Man"" (Taiwanese translation of the book name follows ""Gu Yulan Saburo"" The second part of the Chinese translation drama ""New Gentleman Criminal Police"", and the same as the Japanese paperback, split into two listings, the Chinese translation is currently out of print), the book contains original stories, completely different from the TV version. For him, what is the biggest difference between a novel and a script?
""Actually, I don't like to write novels so much,"" he said quite frankly. ""Because writing novels is done by one person alone, and movies or stage plays need to be assembled together."" He said that he would write ""The 畑 畑 三 三 杀 murder incident"", but it is only because the relevant units want to novelize the script. When I usually find other writers to rewrite, but because he personally does not like this, he decided to create a new story for himself by writing a novel version. As for the novels of the ""Qingshou Conference"", it is born for the movie. ""At the time, we were already planning a movie. When we were discussing whether to do some different propaganda techniques, we thought that we could first write the story as a novel and then film the film as a propaganda technique.""
Because of this, Sangu believes that his understanding of the creation of novels is not enough to talk about the difference between the two. ""If you want to say something, if you use the current situation as an example, then in the case of the script, the first line will be ""A director is interviewing."" The rest of the visual part is the concerted effort. If you write a novel, you have to describe the details of the character's appearance or scene, so that the reader can outline the whole space in the brain. So in this regard, it is also a place that I find it difficult to write novels. He added it further. ""And, it's not a good novel to describe everything. So I don't know how to write a good novel until now.""
When I talked about it, the interview time came to an end. Finally, I still have to ask the director of Sangu. Is there anything I want to express to the Taiwan audience?
""I had a stage play in Taiwan last year, so when I visited Taiwan earlier and earlier, I had a little observation of the reaction of the Taiwanese audience."" He believes that Taiwanese audiences know how to enjoy drama and always enjoy themselves. among them. Sometimes, he even thinks that the Taiwanese audience can feel more about what he wants to express, and therefore he is very happy to have a visit to Taiwan with the ""Missing Minister of Amnesia"".
""Like I was filming ""Galaxy Street"" and ""Qingshou Conference"", I suddenly thought of it in the process. I don't know what the Taiwanese audience will see. So this time when I wrote ""The Minister of Amnesia,"" I occasionally I also think, ah, the audience in Taiwan should feel that this work is not bad.""
