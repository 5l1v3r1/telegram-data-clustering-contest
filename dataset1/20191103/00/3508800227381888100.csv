不想失去生活獨立性，德國病患很少請人做全天性照護
03 Nov 2019, 00:45 by 劉威良


我們想讓你知道的是在德國很少請人做全天性照護，一方面密集的專人照護，費用太高，也容易養成依賴別人照護而失去自我照護的獨立性。另外即使有個案無法自行自理生活，需要全天專人的照護者，也有每兩星期輪一位照護者的可能。



智慧型的照護
德國的護理人力不足，正如世界各地。很多護理人員並非失去照護的熱情或收入不足而退出職場，他們退出職場的主要原因，經常是身體健康亮紅燈，因為搬動病患所需的體力，讓他們很快地折損身體，三五年之後，大家只能紛紛走避。
運用機器協助在德國有許多很好的設備可以移動病患，並協助護理人員省力，移動不能自己起身活動的患者。此機器下方有輪子，並利用一長寬適當的塑布四端，掛吊住受照護者軀體在空中，讓他們成坐臥的方式，就可以輕鬆地推他們到數公尺外寬敞的浴缸泡澡。機器確實讓人省了很多力。
但護理機構為講求快速，希望護理人員找他人一起用兩人腰力抬起病患，速度比較快，經久護理人員脊背耗損，是自然的道理。如果能夠善用機器，對護理人員而言是大好幫手。
失智者共住公寓
失智病患共住的公寓樓上住有行動不便的一般長者，每個房間都有緊急鈴。如有需要，照護者就近可關照。兩棟公寓共用一個大門。大門的側邊牆設按鈕，目的是做進出的管控。
一樓公寓是以正四方的三個週邊（冂型）作為個人房間，共八個房間，每人一間房。中間的空間是廚房與浴室、 前方為廚房、後方為浴室。沒有房間的那面牆與廚房的中間空間是客廳及餐廳。整個樓層的走廊就可繞著中間的廚浴而環走互通。
照護者在廚浴的中間公共空間煮食，或在浴室照護住民，照護者的工作點與住民等距。失智者在房外的公共空間，皆可看到照護者。在客廳的這面牆以落地窗增加明亮度，落地窗外就是綠地花園。
這樣的設計非常人性化，公寓沒有長長的走廊，減少住民對長廊有深不可探的不安全感。繞行的短短走廊，隨時可以碰到室友、照護者或來訪的客人。繞行圍走設計，讓失智不會找不到自己房間，可以一直繞行散步，不會碰壁，並遇到熟悉的臉孔。.

門診式護理及全天照護
居住於自家而有需要特別護理者，在德國有個別選項式的居家服務。早上睡醒無法自己起身換衣著服者，可以等護理人員進門做晨間護理，使之起身。晚間也有睡前的更衣梳洗，使之就寢。另外護理人員也會居家協助進食，給藥、抽血或施做各項護理措施。讓長者保有尊嚴地維持居家作息生活型態，也會有機構提供送餐服務。
在德國很少請人做全天性照護，一方面密集的專人照護，費用太高，也容易養成依賴別人照護而失去自我照護的獨立性。另外即使有個案無法自行自理生活，需要全天專人的照護者，也有每兩星期輪一位照護者的可能。
居家探訪——精神病患照護
台灣的精神科病患，穩定病情之後，多在慢性病房生活，或在機構生活，機構式的生活型態讓病患容易失去對參與日常生活的興趣，有礙融入社會。
過去我服務過的精神科病患的公寓，就在養老院內。養老院一樓是住需要全天有護理人員照護的長者。二樓多是生活可自理，不需要護理人員協助者，但房中有緊急鈴接護理站。而精神病患三人住的公寓則是在二樓。
我專責這三位精神病患的居家照護。一星期工作19個小時，可彈性安排自己的上班時間，工作內容則是安排他們一星期的給藥，並定期打長效針，安排去醫院看醫生，醫院門診的醫生也會兩星期來住處公寓看病患一次。如有必要，我也需協助處理他們與公部門的書信。他們如有專業的法律照護人，文件則由他們處理。
每幾個星期我也要安排室友會議，了解三人的互動並協助他們回復一般生活的復健。例如找時間和他們去散步，買東西、吃冰。有時我帶自己的狗上班時，她們也會撫摸狗與狗說話，或主動要帶狗出去散步。他們在公寓也允許養動物，就像一般的家庭生活一樣。有些患者過去有養過狗，帶狗過去探訪，讓她重現美好的記憶。
另外我也會烤或煮簡單的食物，讓他們體驗感受這些他們在過去生活中的日常活動，並提升他們對自主生活的樂趣。有一位年長的患者，在四年照顧之後，知道我懷孕，竟重拾她的針織手工，為我將來要出生的嬰兒織圍巾，這讓我非常感動。因為我知道她生病50年，都不曾再織過任何東西，這份禮物，就是我最大的成就。

Do not want to lose the independence of life, German patients rarely ask people to do whole-day care
03 Nov 2019, 00:45 by Liu Weiliang


What we want you to know is that in Germany, people are rarely asked to do whole-day care. On the one hand, intensive care of people, the cost is too high, and it is easy to develop independence that depends on others' care and loses self-care. In addition, even if there are cases where you cannot take care of yourself, you need a full-time caregiver, and you may have a caregiver every two weeks.



Smart care
Germany has insufficient nursing staff, just like the rest of the world. Many nursing staff do not lose their care enthusiasm or lack of income and leave the workplace. The main reason for their withdrawal from the workplace is often a healthy red light, because the physical strength required to move patients, so that they quickly lose their body, three or five After the year, everyone can only avoid it.
Using machine assistance, there are many good devices in Germany that can move patients and help caregivers save effort and move patients who can't get up on their own. There are wheels under the machine, and a wide and wide plastic cloth with four ends is used to hang the body of the caregiver in the air, so that they can be placed in a lying way, and they can easily push them to a spacious bathtub a few meters away. Take a bath. The machine does save a lot of power.
However, the nursing institution is quick to ask, and it is natural for the nursing staff to find others to use their waist to lift the patient. The speed is relatively fast and the wearer of the nursing staff is depleted. If you can make good use of the machine, it is a great help for the nursing staff.
Despaired apartment
In the apartment where the dementia patients live together, there are ordinary elders with limited mobility, and each room has an emergency bell. If necessary, caregivers can take care of them. Two apartments share a gate. The side wall of the gate is provided with buttons for the purpose of controlling the access.
The first floor apartment is a three-story (冂 type) as a personal room, with a total of eight rooms and one room per person. The middle space is the kitchen and bathroom, the front is the kitchen, and the rear is the bathroom. The middle wall with no room and the kitchen is the living room and dining room. The corridors on the entire floor can be walked around the middle of the kitchen.
The caregiver cooks in the middle of the kitchen bath, or in the bathroom, and the caregiver's work point is equidistant from the inhabitants. The caregiver can be seen in the public space outside the room. This wall in the living room adds brightness to the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are the green garden.
This design is very user-friendly, and the apartment does not have long corridors, which reduces the insecurities of the residents on the promenade. Short corridors around you can meet roommates, caregivers or visiting guests at any time. Bypassing the design, you can't find your own room, you can walk around, don't touch the wall, and encounter familiar faces. .

Outpatient care and all day care
Those who live in their own homes and need special care, there are individual options for home services in Germany. If you wake up in the morning and can't get up and change clothes and clothes, you can wait for the nursing staff to enter the door for morning care and get up. In the evening, there is also a dressing and grooming at bedtime to make it go to bed. In addition, the nursing staff will also assist in eating, administering, drawing blood or applying various nursing measures. Let the elders maintain their home-based lifestyle in a dignified manner, and there will be institutions to provide food delivery services.
In Germany, people are rarely asked to do whole-day care. On the one hand, intensive personal care, the cost is too high, and it is easy to develop independence that depends on others' care and loses self-care. In addition, even if there are cases where you cannot take care of yourself, you need a full-time caregiver, and you may have a caregiver every two weeks.
Home visits - mental care
After psychiatric patients in Taiwan, after living in a stable condition, they often live in a chronic ward, or live in an institution. The institutional life style makes it easy for patients to lose interest in participating in daily life and hinder their integration into society.
The apartment of the psychiatric patient I have served in the past is in the nursing home. The first floor of the nursing home is an elder who needs nursing care throughout the day. Most of the second floor is self-care, no need for nursing staff, but there is an emergency bell in the room. The apartment for three people with mental illness is on the second floor.
I am responsible for the home care of these three mental patients. Working 19 hours a week, you can flexibly arrange your working hours. The job is to arrange for them to be administered for one week. Regular long-term needles are arranged to go to the hospital to see a doctor. The doctors at the hospital clinic will also stay for two weeks. The apartment is seen once. If necessary, I also need to assist with their correspondence with the public sector. If they have professional legal caregivers, the documents will be handled by them.
Every few weeks I also have to arrange a roommate meeting to understand the interaction of the three people and help them to respond to the rehabilitation of the general life. For example, find time to go for a walk with them, buy things, eat ice. Sometimes when I bring my own dog to work, they also stroking the dog to talk to the dog, or take the initiative to take the dog out for a walk. They also allow animals to be raised in apartments, just like the average family life. Some patients have raised dogs in the past and took the dog to visit in the past, so that she can reproduce good memories.
In addition, I will also bake or cook simple foods, let them experience the daily activities of these past lives, and enhance their fun for their own lives. I have an elderly patient who, after four years of care, knows that I am pregnant, and has regained her knitting handwork, weaving scarves for the baby I will be born in the future, which made me very moved. Because I know that she has been ill for 50 years and has never woven anything. This gift is my greatest achievement.
