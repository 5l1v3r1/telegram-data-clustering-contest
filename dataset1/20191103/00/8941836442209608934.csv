03 Nov 2019

MINNEAPOLIS — A state senator from Minnesota says he’s the victim of “revenge porn” perpetrated by a “former friend” who sent explicit images to legislative colleagues.
Democratic Sen. Scott Dibble says he’s been harassed for the past five months by a man with whom he had an intimate, virtual relationship. Dibble, who is married, said the man sent private photos, videos, and text messages to fellow lawmakers on Friday. A spokeswoman for the Minnesota’s Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, Ellen Anderson, confirmed that lawmakers received such messages.
Dibble’s announcement comes just days after U.S. Rep. Katie Hill of California resigned after nude photos of her were made public.

Dibble did not immediately respond to a phone message left Saturday by The Associated Press.
