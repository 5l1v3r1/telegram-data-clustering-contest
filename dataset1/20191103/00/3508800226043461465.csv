NLP識人術：在意他人評價的「聽覺型」人，是完美的知識收集者
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是「聽覺型」的人有100種不同的「觀點」，也是完美的知識收集者，但卻給不了你半個「建議」。出於非常在意他人對自身的評價，對「建議」可能造成的影響，誠惶誠恐。



文：嚴霆
前篇談了「視覺型」的人，讀者大人們有觀察出周遭「視覺型」的人了嗎？
接下來，聊聊本文的主角「聽覺型」的人。
我們要如何透過吃飯來識別出「聽覺型」的人呢？
朋友要先確定約見的餐廳名稱，通常也會先google哪些菜色有「網推」、交通是否方便、尖峰時段在哪時、是否要先訂位、是否有雷……等各種相關訊息。
在見面那天，你們坐進一家簡餐店，過了1分鐘，你早選好了。服務人員來點餐，朋友表示要再看一下（總共3個套餐的）菜單。接著，你會看著他，一邊望著菜單，一手拖著下巴，用清晰的咬字加上抑揚頓挫的語氣說：
咖哩雞腿飯套餐，350，還有附咖啡或其他飲料⋯飲料平均都在150以上，單點冰美式更要180，但是套餐竟然只要350，我如果喝美式，表示咖哩雞腿飯加上附餐只要170，竟然還不到200喔…好像真的是滿划算的…欸不對喔，這裡消費本來就比較高，我要在這裡吃咖哩雞腿飯嗎？ 景安站巷口那家也才120…可是網友最推薦的就是它的雞腿……
以上，就是經典的「聽覺型」點菜法。
那麼，我們要如何從聊天中識別出「聽覺型」的人呢？
你 : 總覺得最近跟OOO應該是走不下去了，我該怎麼辦？朋友 : 根據我統整了很多兩性專家的建議來說，你大概有幾種做法。第一個，是嘗試再跟他溝通，畢竟你們相處了這麼久，基於過往的感情基礎、在有一定程度的彼此瞭解為前提之下，繼續溝通很可能有挽回機會。但是也有另一派專家認為，如果交往了這麼久，還是無法溝通的話，就表示很可能你們是真的不適合。對了，另外一些專家認為，你們可以討論一下，有沒有可能，找出一個未來能共同努力的目標，如果有，或許你們就有舊情復燃的機會。你 : 那你建議我要…朋友 : 這三種都可以…你自己選好了。
如果心中出現了一種「就是不知道才來問你，但問你是白問」的感覺，那就對了。

我們來談談與「聽覺型」的人相處的DOs AND DON’Ts —

DOs：話講完整一點、音量剛好一點
DON’Ts：太快講重點、太隱私的點、目標太大了點

「聽覺型」的人消費非常精打細算，最在意的就是CP值，一切決定都以確保能打出完美的「安全牌」為前提。而「安全牌」象徵的，是確定買到物超所值的安全感。
那麼，為什麼要邊朗讀菜單邊說出自己的思考過程呢？
思考是無聲的，而安靜的紙本菜單也不會講話，朗誦才可以「化文字為聲音」，協助他們接收整理資訊。（若中斷他們的朗誦，怕會讓你等到暈倒。）
「聽覺型」的人有100種不同的「觀點」，也是完美的知識收集者，但卻給不了你半個「建議」。出於非常在意他人對自身的評價，對「建議」可能造成的影響，誠惶誠恐。
知識收集者通常也不能一葉知秋，要「一大片」葉子才能知秋。要是直接講重點，不把前因後果一併交代得清清楚楚，他們便無法立刻信任你。所以說，要是30秒說服不了他們，請準備再抗戰3小時吧！讀者大人們，歡迎您仔細觀察一下，這樣的人在思考時，眼球經常會以「水平方向」掃視周遭環境，然後才開口說話，表達意見。
我舉個例子，為了實現人類在未來可以移民火星的遠大抱負，著名的美國企業家伊隆・馬斯克於2002年創立了一間名為SpaceX的太空運輸科技公司。
如果讀者大人您有朝一日，也有了類似馬斯克這般前無古人，後無來者的遠大夢想，我真心不推薦您一開始就跟周遭「聽覺型」的好朋友們分享，否則當真是對牛彈琴，冷卻一腔熱血。

人在思考時，眼球的移動方向，就是潛意識理解訊息的方向，或歸納訊息的方式 ; 思考時，眼球的「水平方向移動」，即在判讀該訊息是否合乎常理、是否符合一定程度的「邏輯水平」抑或參考依據。故較難理解「這樣太危險、飛太遠的太空夢想」。他們容易覺得，這想法是真的「太空」、勸你莫作夢、莫再想。
出自對於「邏輯性與每個細節」的追求，如果將「先進的概念」結合在「現有的東西上」，他們比較可能（但不會是立刻）接受。
創立SpaceX之後，馬斯克於隔年2003年又新創立了 （用常識應該尚可理解的）電動車公司Tesla。但是，周遭「聽覺型」朋友仍表示，無法理解汽車不吃汽油改吃電，卻還要賣這麼貴，CP值真的好低。
接下來，談談「聽覺型」的人對於隱私的注重。至於，什麼叫做隱私呢？ 家住哪裡、開新車還中古車、已婚未婚、小孩幾個、衣服哪裡買的⋯⋯全部，都非常的隱私。為了不破壞好不容易才建立起來的信賴感，開口聊這些話題之前，請先「不經意」談到自己的情況，再問他們比較好。
順帶一提，我每次寫完文章，為確保語意通順與邏輯嚴謹，至少要修改10幾次（還不一定滿意）。但是，我去咖啡廳只要1秒鐘就可以點好一杯冰美式 （而且我從來不朗誦菜單）。
或許你會在買車時有點「視覺」、買3C產品時極度「聽覺」、跟小朋友相處時又變得非常「感覺」。情境不同、人的狀態也不同，這樣讀者大人們明白了嗎？
接下來，練習時間到，讀者大人們，想提升對人的觀察力嗎？
請您拿起紙筆，參考上述線索，動筆寫下「什麼時間或空間」的「誰」經常出現「聽覺型」的表徵。
如 :「點菜時的我爸」「買手機時的Amber」「談到保單的Richard」⋯⋯寫得越多，以後您識人的速度就會越快!
下回，我們要來談談「感覺型」的人，敬請期待了。

NLP literacy: The ""auditory"" person who cares about others' evaluation is the perfect knowledge collector.
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by readers


What we want you to know is that ""auditory"" people have 100 different ""points of view"" and are perfect collectors of knowledge, but they can't give you half a ""recommendation"". Since I am very concerned about the evaluation of others, I am sincerely afraid of the possible impact on the ""recommendations"".



Text: Yan Yan
The first part talked about the ""visual"" people. Did the readers have people who observed the ""visual type"" around them?
Next, talk about the protagonist of the article ""Auditory"".
How do we identify people who are ""auditory"" through eating?
Friends must first determine the name of the restaurant they are interviewing. Usually, they will first google which dishes have ""net push"", whether the traffic is convenient, when the peak time is, whether to book first, whether there is a thunder, etc.
On the day of the meeting, you sat in a light meal shop. After a minute, you picked it early. The service staff came to order, and the friend said that he would like to take a look at the menu (3 packages in total). Then, you will look at him, looking at the menu, dragging your chin in one hand, and using a clear bite and a sigh of relief:
Curry chicken leg rice set, 350, as well as coffee or other beverages, the average drink is more than 150, the single point ice is more than 180, but the package is only 350, if I drink American, it means curry chicken leg rice plus meals as long as 170, even less than 200 喔... seems to be really cost-effective... Oh, no, the consumption here is already high, I want to eat curry chicken leg rice here? The Jing'an Station Lane is only 120...but the most recommended thing for netizens is its chicken legs...
The above is the classic ""auditory"" a la carte method.
So how do we identify the ""auditory"" people from the chat?
You: I always feel that I should not be able to go with OOO recently. What should I do? Friend: According to my advice on a lot of gender experts, you probably have several practices. The first one is to try to communicate with him again. After all, you have been together for so long. Based on the past emotional foundation and with a certain degree of mutual understanding, it is very likely that there will be opportunities for recovery. However, there is another expert who believes that if you have been in contact for so long, you still can't communicate, it means that you are really not suitable. By the way, some other experts believe that you can discuss whether it is possible to find a goal that can work together in the future. If there is, you may have the opportunity to rekindle the old feelings. You : Then you suggest that I want to... Friends : All three can be... You choose yourself.
If there is a feeling in the mind that ""I just don't know to ask you, but ask you to ask questions,"" then it is right.

Let's talk about the DOs AND DON’Ts with the ""auditory"" people.

DOs: The words are a bit more complete and the volume is just a little bit better.
DON’Ts: Pointing too fast, too private, too big a target

People with ""audio-type"" consumption are very careful, and the most important thing is the CP value. All decisions are made on the premise of ensuring a perfect ""safety card"". The ""safety card"" symbolizes the security of the value of the purchase.
So why do you want to speak your own thinking process while reading the menu?
Thinking is silent, and the quiet paper menu does not speak. Recitation can be used to ""text as a voice"" to help them receive information. (If you interrupt their reading, I am afraid that you will wait until you faint.)
""Hearing"" people have 100 different ""points of view"" and are perfect collectors of knowledge, but they can't give you half a ""recommendation."" Since I am very concerned about the evaluation of others, I am sincerely afraid of the possible impact on the ""recommendations"".
Knowledge collectors usually can't know the autumn, and they need a ""large piece"" of leaves to know the autumn. If you focus directly on the issues and do not explain the causes and consequences clearly, they will not be able to trust you immediately. So, if you can't convince them for 30 seconds, please prepare for another three hours! Readers, you are welcome to take a closer look. When such people think, the eyeballs often scan the surrounding environment in a ""horizontal direction"" before they speak and express their opinions.
Let me give you an example. In order to realize the great ambition of human beings to immigrate to Mars in the future, the famous American entrepreneur Elon Musk founded a space transportation technology company called SpaceX in 2002.
If you are an adult, you will one day have a big dream like that of Musk, and there is no big dream for you. I really don’t recommend that you share it with the good friends who are “audious” at the beginning, otherwise it’s really playing on the cow, cooling one. The cavity is hot.

When people think, the direction of movement of the eyeball is the way in which the subconscious mind understands the direction of the message, or the way the message is summarized. When thinking, the ""horizontal movement"" of the eyeball is the logic of whether the message is reasonable and whether it meets a certain degree. Level or reference basis. Therefore, it is more difficult to understand ""a space dream that is too dangerous and too far away."" They easily think that this idea is really ""space"", advising you not to dream, not to think.
From the pursuit of ""logical and every detail"", if ""advanced concepts"" are combined with ""existing things"", they are more likely (but not immediately) accepted.
After the creation of SpaceX, Musk created a new electric vehicle company Tesla (which should be understandable with common sense) in 2003. However, the ""hearing-type"" friends around still said that they could not understand that the car did not eat gasoline to change electricity, but it still had to sell so expensive, and the CP value was really low.
Next, let's talk about the privacy of people who are ""auditory"". As for what is called privacy? Where do you live, open a new car, a medieval car, a married, unmarried, a few children, and where the clothes are bought, all are very private. In order not to undermine the sense of trust that was hard to build up, before you talk about these topics, please ""inadvertently"" talk about your situation and ask them better.
By the way, every time I finish writing an article, to ensure that the semantics are fluent and logically rigorous, at least 10 times (not necessarily satisfactory). However, I can get a cup of iced American style in just one second in the coffee shop (and I never read the menu).
Maybe you will be a bit ""visual"" when you buy a car, ""audio"" when you buy a 3C product, and become ""feeling"" when you get along with a child. The situation is different, and the state of the person is different, so that the readers understand it?
Next, practice time, readers adults, want to improve the observation of people?
Please pick up the paper and pencil, refer to the above clues, and write ""what time or space"" of ""who"" often appears as ""hearing type"".
For example: ""My dad when ordering food"" ""Amber when buying a mobile phone"" ""Richard about the policy"", the more you write, the faster you will know in the future!
Next time, we are going to talk about the ""feeling"" people, so stay tuned.
