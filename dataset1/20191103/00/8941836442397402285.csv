Service remembers victims of Atlanta child murders

03 Nov 2019

ATLANTA (AP) - A memorial service was held Saturday to remember the victims of the Atlanta child murders in the 1970s and 1980s.
WSB-TV reports dozens of people, including some family members of the victims, gathered for the service. The string of murders of mostly black boys terrorized the city between 1979 and 1981. The service included the lighting of candles, songs and a procession of hearses.
Catherine Leach, who lost her son Curtis Walker 40 years ago.
“The pain is still here,” she told the station.
Wayne Williams was given two life sentences in 1982 for convictions in the deaths of two adults, thought to be among 29 black children and young adults killed. Police blamed him for the other killings but never charged him.


There has been a renewed push to re-examine evidence in the case.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Police Chief Erika Shields announced in March that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Fulton County District Attorney will review evidence in the “Atlanta Child Murders” cases to see if any of it can be tested further.
