「後物質主義」時代的文青旅者，把貧窮當成一種浪漫的炫耀
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by 公務門小三


我們想讓你知道的是不管嘴上怎麼說，那些人也同意消費主義世界裡以貌取人的道理，但卻不能平白表現資源不足的自己，為了物質只好犧牲食物，圓場的技巧，就是在閒聊旅遊經驗時見縫插針表演「自己有錢不隨便花」的態度。



隨著廉航的普及化，以往只能等轉職或長特休盡情旅行，但現在無論三天泰國按摩按到廢、五天日本環球影城購物旅、還是環歐三十天睡背包客棧等，都變得幾乎是唾手可得，玩法也各有千秋。
以台灣島民的物價而言，到東南亞國家旅遊一星期，可以絢爛式的花錢而毫無後顧之憂，累了就去按摩，彷彿觀賞時靠在身邊人肩上相依偎的夏日煙花，放好放滿後各自解散，徒留整夜的煙硝尚未散去——那是歸國後的信用卡帳單；如果是到較近的日本，省下的長途機票錢、通通灌在迷死人不償命的可愛小物，一、二千日圓看似無害，只是林林總總買下來，常逼人得在驚安殿堂多買一個行李箱。
歐洲，肯定是這三類中公認最豪奢的，但若遊歐三十天全部睡背包客棧，城市內到哪都用走的、不搭車，一天只外食一個PITA餅，也能看見另種庶民風景——這也是現下最夯的「壯遊」。就像是那首老妹才懂唱的「旅行的意義」，沒有你離開我，而是與根植島嶼的自身脫離，花散於異國，最後是開枝散葉或就此花謝各自精彩，旅行真正的美，自己懂就好。
文青式炫貧？旅行其實是人生經驗暗局競賽
相對於上一代對於金錢的價值觀偏向「物質主義」，強調例如存錢買房、買地、買股經濟的安全感，這一代的年輕人過得不特別奢侈，只是再怎麼努力、活得像乞丐十年，才能存到買房的頭期款，於是，住在父母打拚的房子長大的年輕世代，在不虞匱乏的物質生活裡，相較於辛苦打拼半輩子買到兩棟房子的祖父母和父母，轉向尋求自我實現與個人經驗的追求。
歡迎光臨小清新的「後物質主義」。
無論你同意與否，當代的旅行充斥消費主義符號，從行李箱開始就必須講究，無堅不摧RIMOWA還是收納大師真空包？讓我們開門見山說吧，在人生道路競賽上，消費至上的社會裡是貌取人的，人們光明正大比較工作、頭銜、手錶，堂堂的炫富，但在競賽暗局中比的卻不是誰最有錢，既沒炫富、也不裝窮，比的是「異於他人的人生經驗」，甚至還有一些「炫耀貧窮」的道理。

炫貧型文青意不在交換旅行資訊，或許也不意在你說話的內容，他們的重點在從你每句話中借題發揮，找到機會抱怨旅遊勝地觀光客太多、什麼地方已經被玩壞了，到哪家當地真正划算的餐廳吃飯才內行。更重要的是，在你提起在某地吃了碗八百日圓的拉麵時，毫不留情地回應你「太貴了」，那接話的速度和力道就像準備充分的妙麗等待老師丟出問題一樣，並且享受你聽到「太貴」後的驚訝表情，即便是非常細微地，對方嘴角此刻正微微上揚。
原以為是萍水相逢的旅行閒聊，沒想到是這樣，見識到那微微上揚地嘴角你才恍然大悟「啊，原來是個局呀！」
這時候，最好不要打壞文青的炫貧雅興，如果你試圖反駁「我覺得拉麵一碗八百日圓很便宜啊！」那就深陷此局至萬劫不復，文青將顧不得場面話，偷笑的嘴角直接失守，急於開示就算在大城市也有一碗六百日圓以下的拉麵可以吃，再加碼抱怨日本物價高，並且偷渡銀行提款手續費高昂等無關拉麵的話題。
此刻，你彷彿誤上賊船，偷偷望向旁邊，原來離岸邊已遠去，文青式炫貧那股勁兒是奮不顧身、飛蛾撲火地，理性與禮貌全失，乍看之下，你以為他痛恨當下旅行的異國度，差點觸動惻隱之心可憐異鄉遊子時又被拉回現實，原來對方不誠心抱怨，只是藉此表達自己有錢不隨便花的高尚，氣勢如虹，逼迫你必須俯首稱臣、為自己「盤子」的行為道歉。
愛玩又愛抱怨？到頭來，要取捨的原因好像就是「不夠有錢」
所謂旅途過客，大家應該明白萍水相逢的禮節，應該止於禮地好好聊聊彼此喜歡的事物，互道一聲晚安、淺淺微笑，清爽無痛不沾黏，有禮地結束話題。怎知文青如此離經叛道，理性與感性齊失手，傲慢與偏見全端上，異國景點與民情在他眼裡，都成為烘托文青遺世獨立的台子，你冷眼旁觀他搭了這個台。
而當你回復冷靜，仔細思考為何文青這麼討厭異國還要來這裡旅行或當交換學生？為何文青抱怨物價高又要外食？為何文青抱怨貧窮又要出國？即便文青抱怨拉麵很貴，但你篤定他會花更多錢買設計錶、買真皮文件夾、買書衣等等一切你也認為合理價值的好東西，這些好東西，通常也正和五天四夜東京行或曼谷行的璀璨購物之旅的目標雷同。
不過文青們的高招，就在假裝八百日圓的拉麵不划算，而只有他們才懂的真正好東西，才應該這樣買。

所有人都同意，旅行的意義自己懂就好，但能真正身心靈付諸實行的人卻不多。
因為不管嘴上怎麼說，那些人也同意消費主義世界裡以貌取人的道理，卻不能平白地表現出自己為了物質而犧牲食物，圓場的技巧，就是在閒聊旅遊經驗時見縫插針表演「自己有錢不隨便花」的態度，藉此掩飾自己在以貌取人的資本主義社會中「輸人一截」的窘態。
後房奴世代的我們都是小清新，流著父母那輩物產豐饒下的血液，盡情地追求自我實現，好比說旅行。或許正因如此，未嘗過真正的貧窮滋味的文青難免「浪漫化」了貧窮，過膩了台北咖啡館式的文青生活，遠赴他鄉繼續咖啡遊牧，在對外宣稱各式貧窮，唾棄觀光客式的絢爛之旅，反其道而行炫耀貧窮，炫耀自己買到很划算的東西，大讚物美價廉的純正日本貨，說到底，想的還不就是島民最愛掛在嘴上的CP值？
文青最後回過神來，發現自己站在職人手作皮件店裡，等待免稅收據。

The literary travellers in the post-materialist era regarded poverty as a romantic show
03 Nov 2019, 00:48 by official door small three


What we want you to know is that no matter what you say in the mouth, those people agree with the truth in the consumerism world, but they cannot express themselves with insufficient resources. In order to materially sacrifice food, the skill of round the field is to chat about tourism experience. At the time, I saw the attitude of ""I have money and don't just spend it"".



With the popularization of low-cost airlines, in the past, you can only wait for a transfer or a long break to travel, but now whether it is a three-day Thai massage to the waste, five days of Universal Studios Japan shopping trip, or a 30-day sleeping backpacker in Europe Wait, they are almost at your fingertips, and the gameplay has its own merits.
In terms of the price of Taiwanese islanders, traveling to Southeast Asian countries for a week can be spent on money without any worries. When you are tired, go massage, as if you are leaning against the summer fireworks on the shoulders of your neighbors. After they were full, they were disbanded, and the smoke and smoke that stayed overnight were not scattered. That was the credit card bill after returning to China. If it was to Japan, the long-distance ticket money saved by the company would not be paid for by the dead. Cute little things, one or two thousand yen seems to be harmless, but the forests are always bought, often forced to buy a suitcase in the Jingan Temple.
Europe is definitely the most extravagant of these three categories. However, if you go to Europe for 30 days, you will all sleep in a backpacker's inn. You can use the PITA cake for a day in the city. You can also see another kind of people. Landscape - This is also the most embarrassing ""strong tour"". It’s like the meaning of “the meaning of travel” that the old girl only knows and sings. Without you leaving me, it’s separated from the roots of the island itself, scattered in exotic countries, and finally the leaves are scattered or the flowers are thankful for each other. Real beauty, you know it.
Wen Qing style show off poverty? Travel is actually a life experience concealment competition
Compared with the previous generation, the value of money is biased towards “materialism”, emphasizing the sense of security such as saving money to buy a house, buying land, and buying a stock economy. This generation of young people is not particularly extravagant, just how hard and live like Ten years before it can be saved in the first period of buying a house, so the younger generation who grew up in a house where their parents worked hard turned to the grandparents and parents who had worked hard for half a lifetime to buy two houses in the material life that was not lacking. Seek self-realization and the pursuit of personal experience.
Welcome to the small and fresh ""post materialism.""
Whether you agree or not, contemporary travel is full of consumerism symbols, and you must pay attention to it from the beginning of the suitcase. Is it ruined by RIMOWA or the master vacuum bag? Let's get straight to the point. In the road of life competition, the society that consumes the supremacy is a person who looks good. People are brighter and more work, titles, watches, and show off the rich, but in the competition, it is not the one who has the most Money, neither showing off wealth nor pretending to be poor, is more than ""life experience different from others"" and even has some ""showing poverty"".

The poor-looking Wen Qingyi is not exchanging travel information, and may not be interested in what you are talking about. Their focus is on borrowing from each sentence of yours, finding opportunities to complain about too many tourists in the tourist resort, and where the place has been played, It’s good to go to a local, cost-effective restaurant. More importantly, when you mentioned that you had eaten a bowl of eight hundred yen ramen in a certain place, you responded mercilessly to you ""too expensive"", and the speed and strength of the call was like waiting for the teacher to lose. The same problem, and enjoy the surprised expression after you hear ""too expensive"", even if it is very subtle, the opponent's mouth is now slightly rising.
I thought it was a trip to the waters of the waters. I didn’t expect it to be like this. I saw that the slightly raised corner of the mouth suddenly realized that ""Oh, it turned out to be a bureau!""
At this time, it is best not to smash Wen Qing's sleek and elegant Yaxing. If you try to refute ""I think ramen noodles are very cheap in a bowl of eight hundred yen!"" then it will be deeply ruined by this bureau. Wen Qing will not care about the scene. The smirk's mouth is directly deflated, and it is eager to show that even in the big city, there is a bowl of ramen noodles below 600 yen to eat, and then add to the price of complaining about high prices in Japan, and the high cost of smuggling bank withdrawals and other irrelevant ramen topics.
At this moment, you seem to be mistaken on the thief boat, secretly looking to the side, the original far from the shore, Wen Qing-style show off the poor, the strength of the child is to fight the body, the moths to the ground, rational and courtesy lost, at first glance You think that he hates the exotic world of traveling, and almost touched the heart of the sorrowful heart. When he was pitiful, he was pulled back to reality. The other party did not sincerely complain, just to express his own money and not to spend the noble, imposing, persecution. You must bow down and praise the behavior of the ""plate"".
Love to play and love to complain? In the end, the reason for choosing is to ""not enough money.""
The so-called travellers, everyone should understand the etiquette of the Pingshui meeting, should stop at the courtesy to talk about each other's favorite things, good night, smile, refreshing, painless, sticky, politely end the topic. How do you know that Wen Qing is so deviant, rational and emotional are missing, arrogance and prejudice are all over the end, foreign attractions and people's feelings in his eyes have become the platform for the independence of Wen Qing, you watched him with this stand.
And when you respond calmly, think carefully why Wen Qing is so hateing foreign countries to travel here or to exchange students? Why is Wen Qing complaining about high prices and eating? Why does Wen Qing complain about poverty and go abroad? Even if Wen Qing complains that ramen is very expensive, you are sure that he will spend more money to buy design watches, buy leather folders, buy book clothes, and so on. All the good things that you think are of reasonable value. These good things are usually five days a week. The goal of a night shopping trip in Tokyo or Bangkok is the same.
However, the high-profile tricks of Wen Qing are not worthwhile to pretend that the eight hundred yen ramen is not worthwhile, but only the real good things they only know should be bought.

Everyone agrees that the meaning of travel can be understood by themselves, but there are not many people who can actually implement the body and mind.
Because no matter what they say, those people agree with the truth in the consumerism world, but they can't express their own sacrifices for material. The skill of round the field is to see the performance of the chat experience. The attitude of ""Flower"" is to conceal the embarrassment of ""losing people"" in the capitalist society.
We are all small and fresh in the back room slave generation. We are carrying the blood of the parents and the richness of the products, and we are pursuing self-realization, just like traveling. Perhaps because of this, Wen Qing, who has never tasted the true poverty, is inevitably ""romanticized"" to poverty, tired of Taipei's cafe-style Wenqing life, went to other places to continue coffee nomadic, and declared all kinds of poverty and spurned sightseeing. A guest-like journey, showing off the poverty in the opposite direction, showing off what you have bought is a good deal, and praising the authentic Japanese goods at a reasonable price. After all, what you think is not the CP that the islanders love most. value?
Wen Qing finally returned to God and found himself standing in the leather goods shop, waiting for tax exemption.
