      <p>BANGOR, Maine (AP) - A U.S. Senate committee is advancing a proposal from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-collins/">Sen. Susan Collins</a> to improve research about Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-collins/">Collins</a>, a Republican, introduced the proposal with Democratic Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith. It’s also designed to beef up prevention, diagnostics and treatment for tick-borne diseases, and it’s headed to the full Senate next.</p>
      <p>The proposal’s named the Kay Hagan Tick Act in honor of former Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina who died in October of complications from Powassan virus, a tick-borne infection.</p>
      <p>Cases of Lyme disease nearly doubled in Maine from 2010 to 2018. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/susan-collins/">Collins</a> describes the surge of tick-borne diseases as a “burgeoning public health crisis.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The proposal would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy about the diseases.</p>
