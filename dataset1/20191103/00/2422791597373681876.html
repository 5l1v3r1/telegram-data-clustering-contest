      <h1>Protesters gather at gender identity speaker's talk despite location switch</h1>

      <p>VANCOUVER -- Dozens of protesters gathered outside the venue of a panel discussion on gender and sexuality where the location was kept secret until shortly before the event due to security concerns.</p>
      <p>The event was originally scheduled to take place at Simon Fraser University, but was moved after the senior director of campus security said there was a high safety concern.</p>
      <p>The talk includes Meghan Murphy, a freelance writer who has said the acceptance of trans rights threatens cisgender women's rights.</p>
      <p>Her talk at a Toronto library at the end of October drew several hundred protesters, and the Toronto Public Library faced intense criticism for booking the room to the hosts.</p>
      <p>Ticketholders to the Vancouver event learned of the new location at the Pan Pacific Vancouver hotel in an email.</p>
      <p>The message assured attendees that a combination of hotel and the event's security, as well as a police presence "will make this a safe event."</p>
      <p>Temporary gates were erected to prevent unauthorized access to the space, while several police officers and private security workers were on hand.</p>
      <p>Some protesters carried signs proclaiming that "Trans rights are human rights" and "Trans women are women."</p>
