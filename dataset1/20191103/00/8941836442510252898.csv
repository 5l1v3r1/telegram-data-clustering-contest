Woman accused of disorderly conduct outside Maricopa court

03 Nov 2019

MARICOPA, Ariz. (AP) - Authorities say a woman has been arrested for disorderly conduct after creating a messy situation in the courthouse parking lot in the town of Maricopa.
Police say Tally Leto allegedly poured alcohol into the vehicle of a court client, let the air out of the man’s tires and spat on the windows before wiping them off.
The owner of the vehicle didn’t want to prosecute Leto.
But the court chose to press charges because Leto was on court property in the parking lot.
As a result of being arrested last Monday, Leto failed to appear for her two criminal cases scheduled for later that day at Western Pinal Justice Court.


The Maricopa Monitor reports that the two charges Leto was attending court for were criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct.
