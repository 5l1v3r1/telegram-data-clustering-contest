Square Inc. is scheduled to release earnings after Wednesday’s close. Last year, the stock hit a record high of $101.15/share and is currently trading near $62/share. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting:Earnings Preview:
Square is expected to report earnings of $0.20/share on $1.19 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is $0.23. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings.
Company Profile & Various Businesses:
Here is a brief company profile:

Pay Attention To How The Stock Reacts To The News:
From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape.
