      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">New England Patriots</a>‘ unbeaten season crashed to an end under the weight of their own mistakes and inability to contain <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Baltimore Ravens</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Lamar Jackson</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> ripped apart the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s stingiest defense with his arm and legs, accounting for three touchdowns and directing a dominant running game in a 37-20 victory Sunday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> (6-2) zipped to an early 17-0 lead and let the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> (8-1) creep within striking distance before quelling the comeback with a 70-yard fumble return by Marlon Humphrey and a 5-yard touchdown pass from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> to Nick Boyle early in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>That made it 30-20, and not even six-time Super Bowl winner <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a> could bring New England out of the hole. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a>, who went 30 for 46 for 285 yards, threw an interception with 12:47 left.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> then led a methodical 9 1/2-minute drive that ended with his thrust into the end zone from the 1, with no small assist to right tackle Orlando Brown Jr.</p>

      <p>“I was hoping I was in. Orlando pulled me,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> said. “I didn’t even know it was him until I got up. He was like, ‘I pulled you in. I need half of that touchdown.’ It was cool.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a>, the slick second-year quarterback, ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns and went 17 for 23 for 163 yards and a score. Mark Ingram rushed for 115 yards, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s leading ground attack amassed 210 yards.</p>
      <p>“We played tonight like it was a championship game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> said after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a>’s fourth straight victory. “We’ve just got to keep going.”</p>
      <p>New England mixed up its coverages and blitz packages, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> responded accordingly.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“Nobody does it better than they do, and I thought our guys handled it really well, starting with the quarterback,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> coach John Harbaugh said.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> came in with a defense that had allowed only 7.6 points per game and forced 25 turnovers for a plus-17 differential. The defending Super Bowl champions picked up two fumbles, but they had two turnovers themselves and committed a costly penalty that contributed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a>’s first touchdown.</p>
        <p>New England was penalized seven times for 48 yards.</p>
        <p>“We didn’t do anything well enough to deserve to win,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> coach Bill Belichick said. “We’ve all just got to do a better job.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a>’s defense played a role, too. Patrick Onwuasor stripped the ball from Julian Edelman in the third quarter and Humphrey took it the other way for a score. Although <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> answered with a touchdown of his own to make it 24-20, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> would not get closer.</p>
        <p>And so ended New England’s 13-game winning streak, dating to last season and including the playoffs.</p>
        <p>“We did a lot of things (wrong) we need to do better,” Belichick said, his voice barely louder than a whisper.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> opened with a crisp 75-yard drive in which <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> went 4 for 4 for 41 yards and New England extended the march with an uncharacteristic mistake. As <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> lined up for a field goal try, Shilique Calhoun jumped into the neutral zone to give the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> a first down.</p>
        <p>On the next play, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> skirted around left end for an easy 3-yard score .</p>
        <p>After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> went three-and-out on his first series, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> rattled off another 11-play drive and added a field goal.</p>
        <p>The third time the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> got the ball, a 53-yard run by Ingram set up a 12-yard touchdown burst by Gus Edwards to make the score a stunning 17-0.</p>
        <p>New England punted again, and what followed for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> was a deflating miscue let the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> back into it. Cyrus Jones muffed the kick, former Raven Justin Bethel recovered at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> 20 and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Mohamed Sanu.</p>
        <p>New England added two field goals in the final 4 minutes of the half, the first of them after Ingram lost a fumble at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> 19.</p>
        <p>“Here they come roaring back and we make a couple mistakes,” Harbaugh noted. “They made some mistakes, too. It was that kind of a football game.”</p>
        <p>NOTEWORTHY</p>
        <p>New England fell to 8-2 vs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> in regular season (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> is 6-2). … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore/">Baltimore</a> is 10-2 after a bye under Harbaugh, who took over in 2008. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Ravens</a> are 68-24 at home under Harbaugh, including 21-4 in November. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> rookie WR N’Keal Harry was inactive after coming off IR (ankle) and being added to 53-man roster Saturday.</p>
