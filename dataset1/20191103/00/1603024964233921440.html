      <p>Amid an impasse on government formation in Maharashtra due to a tussle between allies BJP and Shiv Sena and unseasonal rains destroying crops, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will head to Delhi on November 4 to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah.</p>
      <p>The BJP won 105 seats in the Assembly polls, results of which were declared on October 24, while the Sena got 56.</p>
      <p>However, the two parties, which fought the polls in alliance, have got caught in a stalemate over the chief minister's post, with the Sena demanding equal division of the top post's tenure and the BJP rejecting it.</p>

      <p>Sources, however, said the meeting with Shah will be to discuss aid from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) to farmers affected by unseasonal rains across the state.</p>
      <p>While the state government announced a Rs 10,000 crore package for affected farmers, ally Sena as well as opposition Congress and NCP called it inadequate considering the several lakh hectares of crops that have been damaged.</p>
      <p>The state government had earlier put the crop area damaged at 54.22 lakh hectares.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, earlier in the day, the Sena's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut had raised the "mysterious silence" of Shah, who heads the BJP, on the deadlock over formation of government.</p>
      <p>The term of the current Maharashtra Legislative Assembly ends on November 9.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
