Health and Ancestry Insights

What cooler gift for a family than an understanding about what their DNA says about their ancestry, traits and health. The 23andMe Health + Ancestry Service shares details about health predispositions ranging from Type 2 Diabetes and Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease, as well as ancestry, finding out exactly where a person’s DNA comes from more than 1,500 regions. The service also shares information about how your DNA can influence your taste, smell and facial features, which could make for some fun family entertainment. Or fistfights.
