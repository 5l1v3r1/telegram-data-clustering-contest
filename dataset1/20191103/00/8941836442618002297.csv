Giants put Shepard back in concussion protocol, out Monday

03 Nov 2019

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - The New York Giants have placed wide receiver Sterling Shepard back in the concussion protocol, ruling him out of their game against Dallas on Monday night.
The Giants (2-6) made the announcement on Sunday afternoon about Shepard, who had just been cleared on Friday and deemed able to play against the NFC East-leading Cowboys (4-3). Shepard missed the past three games after suffering a concussion on Oct. 6 against Minnesota, his second such injury of the season after also experiencing symptoms after the season opener at Dallas. He was held out the following week and returned to action on Sept. 22 against Tampa Bay.
According to Giants coach Pat Shurmur, Shepard told head athletic trainer Ronnie Barnes on Saturday night that he wasn’t feeling well and was sent for further examination. His condition didn’t improve on Sunday, prompting the team to sideline him again.
The 26-year-old Shepard told reporters on Friday about how much he’s learned about handling head injuries, expressing excitement about returning to action. The fourth-year player has 25 receptions for 267 yards in less than four full games.
