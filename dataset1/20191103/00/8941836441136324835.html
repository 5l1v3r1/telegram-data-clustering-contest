      <h1>Asian markets follow Wall Street rise on US jobs data</h1>

      <p>BEIJING (AP) - Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher Monday after unexpectedly strong U.S. jobs data helped to soothe worries American factory activity was weaker than forecast.</p>
      <p>Benchmarks in Shanghai, Hong Kong, South Korea and Southeast Asia advanced. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said American employers added 128,000 jobs in October, better than the 89,000 forecast. That helped to dilute disappointment after a monthly index of manufacturing by the Institute for Supply Management, an industry group, fell for a third month and by a bigger margin than forecast.</p>
      <p>The jobs numbers could help to reassure investors about American household spending, the main driver of the biggest global economy.</p>
      <p>“Rolling on from the better than expected headline figure for the U.S. jobs report, Asian markets are likely to start in decent fashion this week,” said ING in a report.</p>

        <p>The Nasdaq composite gained 1.1% to 8,386.40.</p>
        <p>Friday’s employment numbers helped to shore up investor faith that has been shaken by U.S.-China trade tension and Brexit.</p>
        <p>The world’s largest economies have agreed to at least a temporary truce in what President Donald Trump dubbed “phase one” of a trade deal. Envoys are negotiating the details of that pact, but economists caution major issues have yet to be decided.</p>
        <p>U.S. companies are reporting weaker profits compared with a year ago as global economic activity and consumer demand weaken.</p>
        <p>Britain’s departure from the European Union has been delayed until at least Jan. 31 after the other 27 member governments granted London’s request for a three-month extension.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an election after parliament blocked his plan to leave on Oct. 31 whether the two sides agreed in advanced on their future trade and other relations or not.</p>
        <p>France’s minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said she is advising French companies to prepare for a scenario in which Britain leaves without a divorce deal. She told broadcaster Europe 1 radio the new date of Jan. 31 “is not negotiable.”</p>
