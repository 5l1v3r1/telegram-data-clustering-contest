      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Republican Party officials plan to hold a news conference Monday to discuss their lawsuit against the New Mexico Secretary of State, the Dona Ana County Clerk and the county’s Absentee Voter Precinct Board.</p>
      <p>State GOP officials say the defendants are defying a new law that calls for absentee voters to provide their name, address and year of birth.</p>
      <p>They also say many voters in Dona Ana County have submitted improper ballots.</p>
      <p>The party filed its lawsuit Friday, asking the Third Judicial District Court for an injunction to stop the counting of the absentee votes.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>They also want the court to issue a declaratory judgment to clarify the meaning of the 2019 changes and to set a uniform statewide standard for qualifying and counting absentee votes for this non-partisan election and future ones.</p>
