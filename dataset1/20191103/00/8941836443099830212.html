      <p>STERLING, Va. — Joe Biden is working on a national campaign of his own, but he made time for a trip to Virginia to rally party activists two days before a pivotal state election.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Democratic presidential hopeful and former vice president joined former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, local Democratic officeholders and party leaders on an outdoor stage in an office park in Sterling.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post reports that Biden spoke of the importance of Virginia’s election as a predictor of the 2020 presidential contest. He said: “As Virginia goes, so goes the nation.”</p>
      <p>Virginia Democrats are hoping to take majorities in the General Assembly. Republicans hold thin majorities of 51-48 in the House of Delegates and 20-19 in the Senate.</p>
