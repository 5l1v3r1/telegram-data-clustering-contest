機車旅行經驗談：出發前要注意的七件事
03 Nov 2019, 00:45 by MOTO7 專業機車資訊網


我們想讓你知道的是想來趟機車旅行但不知道如何準備的話，可以參考以下七件事，有助於你安全完成旅程。



騎著自己的愛車來趟自由自在的旅行，對於熱愛騎車的騎士們，肯定是件極具吸引力的活動，但若不知道該如何著手準備的話，參考這七件一定要注意的事，讓你輕鬆投入在享受乘風而行的樂趣中。
一、驚覺騎錯路，油表紅燈拉警報
一趟旅行最重要的就是路線規劃，現在導航設備十分發達，在路線規劃上已經相對容易，在出發前妥善安排行經路線是騎士必修學分，計畫前往山區露營、探險的玩家們更得要熟記路段，雖然現在已經有多種導航可供選擇，如Google Maps，但部分路段是有道路通行管制，比如台21往塔塔加方向有夜間管制，這方面的資訊可以參考公路總局網站得知。
油量計算是旅行相當重要的一環，東部或山區部分加油站營業時間只到下午六點，請務必事先設定好每一個加油站的位置，如果因為沒油顧路的很糗又麻煩阿。
二、你要流汗還是流血？
全套防摔裝備對於玩車多年的老司機來講可說是必需品，若是新手預算不足也至少得穿著外套（牛仔或有厚度之材質），即便不幸摔車也不至於完全沒有防護力，路途上也偶爾會有被飛石打到的情況，因此多一層保護便能有效避免不必要的皮肉傷。
多次環島的經驗下，時常看到年輕的大學生熱血環島，但小兄弟們只穿著短褲或短袖，甚至有穿著拖鞋的畫面，看了相當怵目驚心，若真的不慎摔車，手腳可是首當其衝受傷的部位，因此選擇適當的鞋子和裝備才能讓身體受到較完整的保護。
長途騎乘也得考慮到溫度變化，騎車受風的影響，通常會以室溫下舒服的狀態下再多穿一件外套，即使是酷熱的夏天環島也至少要有相對透風的長袖外套。出門在外萬事難料，做足防備才能降低各種風險。
三、行前的車況檢查與保養
五油一水「汽油、機油、鍊條油／齒輪油、剎車油、水箱液」以及輪胎磨耗狀況，是每趟出門必檢查的項目。機油可以事先預估此趟旅行的里程數，若已到該換機油或差不多可以換機油的時機，可以先做更換；傳動系統大致可分成依鍊條傳動及皮帶傳動兩種來注意，多數檔車都屬鍊條傳動，出門前做清潔並且上油，不僅能讓鍊條本身的壽命更長，也能降低對齒盤的磨耗，事前的檢視也可以避免鍊條／皮帶於旅途中斷裂，這都是不樂見的意外，同時最好也能自備一些手工具、補胎包以備不時之需。
四、慎選旅伴，朋友不一定是好同伴
曾在外地求學經驗的朋友或許知道，當你與三五好友共租一房，身分從朋友進階到室友，可能是災難的開端，各種生活習慣的差異表露無疑，同樣道理在選擇機車旅伴時也通用，團體騎乘時更多時候不只是自己騎自己爽，更得顧慮到前後左右的夥伴，在每個人騎乘習慣不同下，可能會導致行車安全上的疑慮。舉例來說，在彎中硬要超車、換車道不打方向燈⋯⋯等習慣的旅伴，還是敬而遠之吧。
同伴之間最好配備有對講機，在長途旅程下難免發生恍神的情況，透過對講機保持通話能有效避免精神不濟的情況，此外領路先鋒也能有效的提醒後方夥伴，哪個路口要轉彎，有突發狀況產生時也能馬上做出反應。根據筆者的經驗，特別是摔車的時候非常重要，意外總是來的又急又突然，團體騎乘的情況下若有任何一個夥伴落隊了，沒有對講機的話，可能造成後方夥伴已經發生狀況，卻眼睜睜的看著前方領頭離自己越來越遠，如此無助的情況可是真實發生在筆者自己身上。

五、上路前你不會知道的小秘訣
現在你整裝待發，確認這趟旅程將要行經的路線，檢查有沒有任何遺漏的裝備，但你曾想過嗎，上路的時間點也至關重要，甚至會影響你的人身安全。
曾經，你在夏日傍晚時分騎乘在街道上，天氣好的快活眼睛卻睜也睜不開，日落的陽光正無情地直射你脆弱的感光細胞，身旁車水馬龍的下班車潮更讓令人提心吊膽，想當然爾外出旅行不會想碰到這樣的情況。長程旅途免不了碰到日出日落的時段，因此出發前不仿參考看看氣象局網站，將日出日落的時間點避開，或許將用餐時間安排在這兩個時段，稍作休息，避免陽光帶來的行車危害。
六、調整心態準備面對各種狀況
騎車對於騎士來說可是想到都會笑，但真正踏上旅途時可未必呢，特別在夏天炙熱太陽的荼毒下，全罩帽內的臉龐，洋溢的不見得是笑容，更多時候是逼人抓狂的汗水，最糟糕的是還遇上打雷、下雨、車輛爆胎、電發壞掉等狀況。
七、多準備一把備用鑰匙吧
這類錯誤相信許多人都犯過，若是在日常中頂多想辦法回家拿備份鑰匙，但出門在外發生這種憾事可是捶心肝呢，建議將備用鑰匙放在隨身攜帶的空間中，像是錢包、腿包等等，與其他行李分開，多一分準備多一分保障。
喜歡山林的朋友們見到溪水可能跟筆者一樣興奮不已，我曾經前往高雄茂林戲水時，沒注意到鑰匙就放在口袋，便在野溪裡頭追趕跑跳碰，等到玩累了才回過神來發現鑰匙居然失蹤了，在山林中要是鑰匙不見，可能就要像電影一般上演接電發動了。幸好那次筆者左翻右找之下，非常幸運的在溪流的平坦處發現掛著紅色飾品的鑰匙。鑒於此次經驗，筆者每次只要跨縣市出遠門，一定會多帶備用鑰匙放在錢包，以備不時之需。
出門在外最重要的就是安全，機車相對於汽車得有更高的警覺性，否則一點差錯都可能導致整趟旅行泡湯，注意這七件事，讓你的每一趟機車旅都是難忘且愉悅的回憶。

Locomotive travel experience: seven things to pay attention to before departure
03 Nov 2019, 00:45 by MOTO7 Professional Locomotive Information Network


We want you to know that if you want to travel on a locomotive but don't know how to prepare, you can refer to the following seven things to help you complete your journey safely.



Riding your own car for free travel is definitely an attractive activity for knights who love cycling, but if you don't know how to get ready, refer to these seven things that you must pay attention to. Let you easily invest in the fun of enjoying the wind.
First, I was shocked to ride the wrong road, the oil meter red light pull alarm
The most important thing about a trip is route planning. Nowadays, the navigation equipment is very developed. It is relatively easy to plan the route. The proper route before the departure is the knight's compulsory credits. The players who plan to go camping in the mountains and explore are more familiar. In the road section, although there are already a variety of navigation options, such as Google Maps, some road sections have road traffic control. For example, Taiwan 21 has night control in the direction of Tataga. Information on this can be found on the website of the General Administration of Highways.
The calculation of oil quantity is a very important part of travel. The gas station in the eastern or mountainous area is only open until 6 pm. Please set the location of each gas station in advance, if it is very embarrassing and troublesome because there is no oil.
Second, do you want to sweat or bleed?
A full set of anti-drop equipment can be said to be a necessity for the old driver who has been driving for many years. If the novice budget is insufficient, at least the jacket (denim or material with thickness) must be worn. Even if it is unfortunate, the vehicle will not be completely unprotected. Occasionally, there will be cases of being hit by flying stones, so an extra layer of protection can effectively avoid unnecessary skin injuries.
After many rounds of experience around the island, I often see young college students enthusiasm around the island, but the little brothers only wear shorts or short sleeves, and even have pictures of wearing slippers. They are quite shocking. If they accidentally fall into the car, their hands and feet are the first to bear the brunt. Injury, so choose the right shoes and equipment to protect your body.
Long-distance rides must also take into account temperature changes. The rider is affected by the wind. Usually, a jacket is worn at a comfortable temperature at room temperature. Even the hot summer islands must have at least a relatively long-sleeved jacket. It’s hard to go out and go out to prevent all kinds of risks.
Third, the car condition inspection and maintenance before the trip
Five oils and one water ""gasoline, engine oil, chain oil / gear oil, brake oil, water tank liquid"" and tire wear condition are items that must be checked every time. The oil can estimate the mileage of the trip in advance. If it is time to change the oil or almost change the oil, you can replace it first; the transmission system can be roughly divided into two types according to the chain drive and the belt drive. It is a chain drive. It is clean and oiled before going out. It not only makes the chain itself last longer, but also reduces the wear on the toothed disc. The inspection beforehand can also avoid the chain/belt breaking during the journey. If you are happy, you can also bring your own hand tools and tire packs for your needs.
Fourth, carefully choose travel companions, friends are not necessarily good companions
A friend who has studied in a foreign country may know that when you share a room with a friend of three or five, the status of a friend from a friend to a roommate may be the beginning of a disaster. The differences in various living habits are undoubted. The same reason is when choosing a locomotive travel companion. It is also common. When you ride a group, you don't just have to ride your own cool, but you have to worry about the partners before and after. In each person's riding habits, it may lead to doubts about driving safety. For example, if you want to overtake a car in a corner, change lanes, and do not use the direction of the lights, you can still stay away from it.
It is best to have a walkie-talkie between the companions. In the long journey, it is inevitable that there will be a situation of blasphemy. Keeping the conversation through the intercom can effectively avoid the situation of mental discomfort. In addition, the leader of the road can effectively remind the rear partner, which intersection is going to turn, there is a sudden The reaction can be made immediately when the hair condition occurs. According to the author's experience, especially when it is crashing, it is very important. The accident always comes suddenly and suddenly. If there is any partner in the case of group riding, if there is no walkie-talkie, it may cause the situation of the rear partner. However, I watched the leader in front of me getting farther and farther away from me. This helpless situation happened to me.

5. Tips you won’t know before you go on the road.
Now that you are ready to go, confirm the route that the journey will take, check if there are any missing equipment, but have you ever thought about it, the time of the road is also crucial, and even affect your personal safety.
Once, you were riding on the street in the summer evening. The good weather and happy eyes couldn’t open, the sunset sun was ruthlessly directing your fragile photoreceptor cells, and the next bus ride was even more People are afraid, and of course they will not want to encounter such a situation when they travel. Long-distance travel will inevitably encounter the time of sunrise and sunset, so do not look at the weather bureau website before departure, avoid the time of sunrise and sunset, perhaps arrange the meal time in these two periods, take a break, avoid the sun The driving hazard.
6. Adjust your mentality and prepare to face various situations.
Cycling is a laugh for the Cavaliers, but it’s not necessarily true when you are on the road, especially in the hot sun in the summer, the face inside the full cap is not necessarily a smile, more often it is compelling. Crazy sweat, the worst is that it also encountered thunder, rain, vehicle puncture, electric hair broken and so on.
7. Prepare a spare key.
This type of mistake is believed to have been committed by many people. If you want to go home and get a backup key in your daily life, but this kind of regret happens when you go out, it is recommended to put the spare key in the space you carry with you, like Wallets, leg packs, etc., separate from other luggage, and prepare one more point for protection.
Friends who like the forest see the stream may be as excited as the author. When I went to Kaohsiung Maolin, I didn’t notice the key in my pocket. I chased and ran in the wild stream and waited until I was tired. God came to discover that the key has disappeared. If the key is not seen in the forest, it may be like a movie. Fortunately, the author turned left and right, and was very fortunate to find the key to the red ornament on the flat of the stream. In view of this experience, the author will only take the spare key in the wallet as long as he crosses the county and city, in case of emergency.
The most important thing to go out is safety. The locomotive has a higher alertness than the car. Otherwise, a mistake can lead to a whole trip. Pay attention to these seven things and make each of your locomotives unforgettable and enjoyable. Memories.
