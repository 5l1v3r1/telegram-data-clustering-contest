      <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - A federal judge has lifted the suspension of a West Virginia pharmacy’s ability to dispense prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports U.S. District Judge Joseph R. Goodwin last week lifted the suspension against Oak Hill Hometown Pharmacy that U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart had announced in August.</p>
      <p>Goodwin says federal prosecutors failed to adequately prove the pharmacy posed a public health risk.</p>
      <p>Stuart says the pharmacy had filled about 2,000 prescriptions for a widely abused drug used to treat opioid addiction. He says more than half of the prescriptions came from an out-of-state clinic and that almost all prescriptions were paid for in cash.</p>
      <p>West Virginia by far leads the nation in the rate of drug overdose deaths.</p>
