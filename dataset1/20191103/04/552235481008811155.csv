Prisoners in a high ­security prison have set fires in the building in protest at being locked up for 22 hours a day .
Inmates caused the ­damage at HMP Addiewell in West Lothian after it was hit by staff shortages.
At least two fires have been started in the privately run jail as tensions increase over conditions.
Prisoners also staged a protest by refusing to go back to their cells on Friday night.
Operator Sodexo Justice Services says the jail is about 47 officers short.
 
Last month, it emerged five trainee officers had left their jobs after failing drug tests.
A family member of one prisoner said: “There are not enough staff to let the ­prisoners out of their cells and put them back in again.”
Another source said: “The same officers are trying to run multiple halls, it’s an impossible job.”
An HMP Addiewell spokesman said: “Due to a very short notice set of ­staffing circumstances, we have had to regrettably restrict the amount of time out of cells in the prison over the last couple of days.
“Restricting the daily ­routine is always a very last resort for us and has been done purely to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all those who live and work in Addiewell.”
