      <p>A deal to buy Steven “Bonzo” Daniel’s house has fallen through amid claims the Crown would attempt to seize any profit.</p>
      <p>The sale of his four-bed detached home in<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bishopsbriggs"> Bishopbriggs</a>, near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>, was on the market for offers over £270,000.</p>
      <p>But despite reports that a price was agreed with a mystery buyer, the deal collapsed, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunday-mail">Sunday Mail</a> has revealed.</p>
      <p>Sources say there had been concern that the sale had attracted the attention of the authorities, who might go after any money generated from the house sale.</p>
      <p>Under Proceeds of Crime legislation, prosecutors can go after houses, luxury goods and cars if they can prove they were bought with money earned through illegal activity.</p>
      <p>The law gives authorities the power to act, even if there has never been a conviction.</p>
      <p>A source said: “It seemed he was keen to move from the home after everything that has happened. He had a police guard constantly at his home for months.</p>
      <p>“Everything was agreed but fell through. The suggestion is the sale was attracting too much attention from the authorities, who might look at the house sale.”</p>
      <p>Records show the property was bought by Daniel’s partner Avril Connell in 2003.</p>
      <p>It was reported that a sale was agreed in May but in August the house was remortgaged by Ms Connell.</p>
      <p>Selling agents had marketed the house as being “cleverly extended and extensively upgraded”.</p>
      <p>It offered any new owner “a good degree of privacy” due to its tree-lined gardens.</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokeswoman said: “We can’t comment on the sale of the house – that’s a private matter.”</p>
      <p>She added that there were no outstanding <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/proceeds-of-crime">Proceeds of Crime</a> confiscation orders against Daniel.</p>
