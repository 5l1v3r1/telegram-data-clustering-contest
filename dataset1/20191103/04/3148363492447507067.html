      <h2>President Donald Trump was cheered by fans as he entered the arena at Madison Square Garden in New York City for UFC 244 — but there were also boos.</h2>

      <p>Videos by fans showed the response to Trump, such as the following:</p>

      <p>Early mainstream media reports focused on the fact that there were boos, as did Trump’s critics on social media:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, the <i>New York Post</i> reported, there were more cheers than boos:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The <i>Post</i> story noted that Trump received “more cheers than boos,” and “had very vocal supporters inside and outside the World’s Most Famous arena.”</p>
      <p>Donald Trump, Jr. retweeted the <i>Post</i> article, with a snide comment — and his tweet was retweeted by the president himself. President Trump also tweeted a photo taken at the event by Eric Trump that reported chants of “Donald Trump” and “USA”:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The <i>Post</i> also reported that supporters and opponents of the President both gathered outside the arena — and that supporters outnumbered opponents, two-to-one.</p>

      <p>Trump and his family were at the event for the main attraction, the fight for the title of “BMF” (“Baddest Motherf**ker”), between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz.</p>
      <p>Masvidal had praised Trump earlier in the week:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/PolishPatriotTM/status/1190006997707571200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>“No matter what your views are on Trump as a president, the guy’s a bad mother f*ucker, man,” Masvidal said. “The money that he’s made, the obstacles that he’s conquered — he’s a bad mother f*cker in his own way, you know, no matter what your political views are.”</p>
      <p>Trump and his family are long-standing UFC fans. Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump both <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/08/04/watch-ufc-fighter-colby-covington-thanks-trump-family-after-defeating-robbie-lawler/">watched</a> Colby Covington — a proud Trump supporter — win a fight in August.</p>
      <p>Other Republicans joined Trump at the fight, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Rep. Pete King (R-NY).</p>
