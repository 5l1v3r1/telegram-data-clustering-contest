      <p>Some of <b>Rowoon</b>'s new fans are stirring up trouble in the <b>SF9</b> fandom.</p>
      <p>Rowoon has gathered a lot of new fans through his drama '<b>Extraordinary You</b>' - while this is of course a good thing, some of his new fans are refusing to accept that Rowoon is part of SF9. The situation has come to where new fans are actively writing, ''<b><i>ONLY </i></b><i>Seokwoo should be happy</i>", "<i><b>ONLY</b> let Seokwoo do well</i>", "<i>How long will it be until Seokwoo leaves?</i>", and more.</p>

      <p>Because of the lack of policing in the fan cafe, there have been several cases where these new fans have written things like "<i>We'll always be by ASTRO's side</i>", "<i>How's 1the9's new song</i>", and writing their nicknames as '<i>Wooseok's Future</i>' and more, even though mentioning other idols and using them in nicknames is strictly forbidden.</p>
