港急救員被中國製催淚彈炸傷 背部皮膚焦黑（視頻）

03 Nov 2019, 04:32

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月03日訊】11月2日晚，香港警方在銅鑼灣時代廣場清場過程中，向記者和義務急救人員投擲中國製催淚彈。催淚彈在一名急救人員背部爆開，導致其背部大面積皮膚燒傷，受傷急救員當即痛苦倒地，並出現休克情況。
據《城市廣播》（CBC）報導，當晚6點45分，一名急救員遭港警投擲的催淚彈擊中後背，隨即倒地。
當時，這名急救員並未戴防毒面罩，其他急救員及《城市廣播》記者立即將傷者扶離催淚煙霧瀰漫的現場，進行急救。
受傷急救員表情極為痛苦，並出現休克情況，他的背部被催淚彈炸傷，大面積皮膚嚴重燒傷，焦黑、脫落。傷者隨即被送往律敦治醫院救治。



有目擊者稱，該名急救員被催淚彈擊中時後背爆出火光。據悉，香港警方使用的是中國製手擲式催淚彈，燃燒溫度極高。
《南華早報》此前曾引述消息稱，香港警方的催淚彈存貨已無法應付現有需求，最近改向中國大陸購入大批催淚彈，與中共反恐部隊使用的型號相同，聲稱其爆發時間較快，煙霧更密集，令目標更難及時作反應。
急救員被催淚彈炸傷的消息在網路曝光後，香港網民紛紛為他祈禱，「願上天保佑」、「祝早日康復」。網民們還痛斥「警方胡亂向人群使用殺人武器」，已經不是第一次，記者都中過好幾次。

Hong Kong first responders were injured by Chinese tear gas. Back skin burnt black (video)

03 Nov 2019, 04:32

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 03, 2019] On the evening of November 2, Hong Kong police threw Chinese-made tear gas into reporters and volunteers during the clearance of Times Square in Causeway Bay. The tear gas bomb exploded on the back of a first-aid person, causing a large area of skin burn on the back. The first-aid injured person immediately fell to the ground and suffered a shock.
According to ""City Broadcasting"" (CBC), at 6:45 that night, a first-aid rescuer was hit by a tear gas bomb thrown by the Hong Kong police and fell to the ground.
At that time, the first-aid staff did not wear a gas mask, and other first-aiders and ""City Radio"" reporters immediately took the injured away from the scene of tears and smog, for first aid.
The injured first-aid was extremely painful and had a shock. His back was injured by tear gas, and a large area of the skin was severely burned, blackened and shedding. The injured were immediately taken to Ruttonjee Hospital for treatment.



Witnesses said that the first-aider was hit by a tear gas when he hit the back. It is reported that the Hong Kong police use Chinese hand-throwing tear gas, which has a very high combustion temperature.
The South China Morning Post has previously quoted that the Hong Kong police’s tear gas inventory has been unable to cope with the existing demand. Recently, it has changed its purchase of a large number of tear gas bombs to mainland China. It is the same model used by the CCP’s anti-terrorist forces, claiming that it has a faster outbreak and more dense smoke. Make the goal more difficult to respond in time.
After the news of the first-aid staff being injured by tear gas, Hong Kong netizens prayed for him, ""I wish God bless"" and ""I wish a speedy recovery."" The netizens also denounced that ""the police used the killing weapons indiscriminately to the crowd"". This is not the first time. The reporters have been in the air several times.
