      <h2>A prison source said staff shortages have led to prisoners being kept in their cells for long periods of time.</h2>

      <p>Prisoners in a high ­security prison have set fires in the building in protest at being <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-prison-service">locked up for 22 hours a day</a> .</p>
      <p>Inmates caused the ­damage at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prisons">HMP Addiewell</a> in West Lothian after it was hit by staff shortages.</p>
      <p>At least two fires have been started in the privately run jail as tensions increase over conditions.</p>
      <p>Prisoners also staged a protest by refusing to go back to their cells on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Operator Sodexo Justice Services says the jail is about 47 officers short.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Last month, it emerged five trainee officers had left their jobs after failing drug tests.</p>
      <p>A family member of one prisoner said: “There are not enough staff to let the ­prisoners out of their cells and put them back in again.”</p>
      <p>Another source said: “The same officers are trying to run multiple halls, it’s an impossible job.”</p>
      <p>An HMP Addiewell spokesman said: “Due to a very short notice set of ­staffing circumstances, we have had to regrettably restrict the amount of time out of cells in the prison over the last couple of days.</p>
      <p>“Restricting the daily ­routine is always a very last resort for us and has been done purely to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all those who live and work in Addiewell.”</p>
