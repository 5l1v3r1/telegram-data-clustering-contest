Kate McKinnon’s Elizabeth Warren brought her folksy charm to SNL’s cold open on November 2, and gave audience members everywhere the pep talk they needed to finally dump their, uh, toxic insurance plans. New cast member Chloe Fineman starred as an inquiring town-hall attendee who asked if she could keep her insurance plan under Warren’s policies. “Let me help you understand,” Warren replied, “Your insurance plan is like a bad boyfriend. Girl, listen to me. He is draining you. You deserve better! Dump his ass!” Considering the real Elizabeth Warren already has a proven track record with helping out women with their love lives, this sketch may not stray too far from the truth.
