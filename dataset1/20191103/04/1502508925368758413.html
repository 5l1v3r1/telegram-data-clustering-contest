      <p>Even as government formation in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/maharashtra">Maharashtra </a>is in a limbo, Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>president <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>are touring parts of the state which suffered crop damage due to unseasonal rains last month.</p>
      <p>Fadnavis is inAkola on Sunday to meet farmers and review the crop damage caused in the district due to untimely rains, an official in the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said.</p>
      <p>Thackeray is touring Aurangabad district on Sunday where he will take stock of the crop losses in Kannad and Vaijapur talukas, a statement by the Sena said.</p>
      <p>The state government on Saturday approved Rs 10,000 crore as a special provision to provide immediate assistance to farmers affected by unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>Crops like jowar, paddy, cotton, maize, tur and soyabean on 54.22 lakh hectares spread across 325 talukas in some districts have been damaged, Fadnavis said after a review meeting on Friday.</p>
      <p>During a Cabinet sub-committee meeting on Saturday, Fadnavis directed the officials concerned to review the ground situation in their respective areas and finalise details of the assistance to be provided.</p>
      <p>The state witnessed unprecedented post monsoon showers this year, especially due to cyclones in the Arabian Sea.</p>
      <p>Most of the crop damage due to untimely showers was caused in the second and third weeks of October.</p>
      <p>State Transport Minister Diwakar Raote on Saturday visited farmlands affected by heavy rains in Akola to assess crop damage.</p>
      <p>The opposition Congress earlier dubbed the provision of Rs 10,000 crore for farmers as a "mere eyewash", while NCP leader Ajit Pawar said it was "inadequate" and that the BJP and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>should come together and form government to provide relief to farmers hit by untimely rains.</p>
      <p>The BJP and its ally <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>are currently at loggerheads over sharing of power in the new government.</p>
      <p>There was also speculation that the Shiv Sena may join hands with the NCP and form government with outside support from the Congress.</p>
      <p>Some state Congress leaders have said the party should back the Sena to keep the BJP out of power.</p>
      <p>In the last month's polls to 288-member state Assembly, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena-56, NCP-54 and Congress-44.</p>
