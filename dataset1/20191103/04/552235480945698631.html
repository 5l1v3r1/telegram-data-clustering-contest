      <h1>Brother of missing Scot Lisa Brown reveals daily struggle four years after she vanished in Spain</h1>
      <h2>Craig Douglas says the family remain hopeful officers will make a breakthrough despite it being revealed last week that a judge has closed the investigation.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Derek Alexander, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/derek-alexander/</a></address>
      <p>The brother of missing expat Lisa Brown has said he still struggles with day-to-day life on the fourth anniversary of her disappearance in Spain.</p>
      <p>Craig Douglas also said he has kept faith in detectives getting<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice"> justice</a> for his sister.</p>
      <p>Police suspect she has been murdered.</p>
      <p>Lisa’s family will tomorrow mark four years since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/missing-people">she was last seen</a>.</p>
      <p>Craig revealed they remain hopeful that officers will make a breakthrough, despite it being revealed last week that a judge has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">closed the investigation</a>.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old, of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, said: “The anniversary is a hard day for us to get through.</p>

      <p>Mentally, it’s difficult. But we have to keep believing that one day we’ll do what we set out to do – find Lisa and bring her home.</p>
      <p>“We just try to get on with our day-to-day life, which isn’t easy.</p>
      <p>“The judge’s decision to close the investigation doesn’t change anything.</p>
      <p>The family were informed he’d made this decision months ago.”</p>
      <p>He added: “If someone comes forward with new information, then it’ll be reopened. We have a good relationship with the investigators in Spain.</p>
      <p>They are not working on Lisa’s case 24/7 but, if key information comes to light, then they’ll act on it.</p>

      <p>“It can take people years to decide to speak out. If it happens soon, then great. But if it doesn’t, we’ll keep waiting.”</p>
      <p>Lisa vanished from Guadiaro, near San Roque in the south-west of Spain, on November 4, 2015.</p>
      <p>Her ex-boyfriend Simon Corner was at the centre of a murder probe after the 32-year-old went missing.</p>
      <p>Officers said a “violent episode” had taken place at the home she shared with the Liverpudlian, who has been described as a yacht salesman.</p>
      <p>Five other Brits – four men and a woman – were also investigated for obstructing justice.</p>
      <p>Lisa, who was from<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alexandria"> Alexandria</a> but had lived abroad since she was 18, was reported missing after failing to collect her son Marco from school.</p>

      <p>No trace of her has been found since.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors halted the investigation in April 2017 because they felt there was insufficient evidence for a trial.</p>
      <p>But the case was reopened to examine mobile phone data obtained from handsets which were recovered in Denmark, where Corner was arrested on a European Arrest Warrant after he fled Spanish police.</p>
      <p>Corner – jailed for three months in Gibraltar in 2014 for having an offensive weapon – vanished again when he <br/>was on bail but police apprehended him at Heathrow Airport and he was extradited back to Spain in 2018.</p>
      <p>He was then told the investigation into his involvement in Lisa’s dis-appearance was being halted.</p>
      <p>Lisa’s mum Catherine Brown, 74, passed away in February, leaving the family – including Craig, his brother Martin and elder sister Helen Jordan – heartbroken that she wouldn’t see justice delivered for her girl.</p>
      <p>Their £100,000 reward for information offered in 2017 is still available.</p>
      <p>MP Martin Docherty-Hughes met Spain’s ambassador to the UK in London last month to discuss the case.</p>
      <p>He described their conversation as positive and he was given assurances that detectives would reopen the probe if new information emerged.</p>
      <p>The MP said: “This has been a difficult year for Lisa’s family, yet I’m heartened by the work that has been undertaken by the Spanish authorities.”</p>
