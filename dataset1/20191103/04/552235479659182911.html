      <h1>MSP urges Holyrood to tightens lobbying rules after Ruth Davidson two jobs scandal</h1>
      <h2>The SNP’s Gordon Macdonald wants a ban on working for a ­lobbying firm while ­someone is representing a Holyrood constituency.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:30:00+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>An MSP has demanded that Holyrood tightens rules on lobbying in the wake of Ruth ­Davidson’s two jobs scandal.</p>
      <p>The ex-Scottish Conservative leader last week dropped a plan to take a £50,000 position with ­Tulchan Communications while ­she <br/>continued to sit at ­Holyrood.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ruth-davidson-turns-down-50k-20749096">She backed down</a> under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/ruth-davidson-urged-quit-holyrood-20713500">pressure from ­politicians</a> who said the 25 day-a-year contract would have been a conflict of interest, and called for her to quit as an MSP.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s Gordon Macdonald has now written to Holyrood’s standards committee chairman Bill Kidd to ask for a ban on working for a ­lobbying firm while ­representing a Holyrood ­constituency.</p>

      <p>He also wants MSPs to be able to ask urgent questions of the Scottish Parliamentary ­corporate body, which would have allowed Davidson’s ­membership of the body to be scrutinised last week.</p>
      <p>Macdonald said: “There was rightly outrage about Ruth Davidson’s attempt to take a well-paid job with a lobbying firm while still sitting as an MSP.</p>
      <p>“That would have been a clear conflict of interest.</p>
      <p>“MSPs have strict rules against taking paid lobbying – yet there is not an explicit ban on working for lobbying firms, which potentially leaves a ­loophole to be exploited.</p>
      <p>“We need to look again at these rules and ask if they’re fit for purpose.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Davidson has insisted she sat down with parliamentary ­officials to examine the code of conduct “to avoid any conflict”.</p>
      <p>She added: “If I am asked to choose between Holyrood and this role, I choose the ­parliament I have dedicated the last nine years to, eight as party leader, a decision Tulchan ­supports.”</p>
      <p>Davidson has also set up a firm called Kirkholm ­Broadlands with her partner Jen Wilson, on top of her work as <br/>an MSP.</p>
