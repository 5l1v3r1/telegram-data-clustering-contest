      <p>Football manager David Robertson has revealed filmmakers want to give his miracle Indian club the Bollywood treatment.</p>
      <p>BBC Scotland’s hit documentary about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-rangers-aberdeen-defender-david-10678106">David’s team Real Kashmir</a> is in line for a prestigious Bafta Scotland award tonight.</p>
      <p>And the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> defender has revealed he has met producers about turning their journey to India’s top league into a drama.</p>
      <p>Kashmir’s first professional club was only formed three years ago.</p>
      <p>Robertson’s achievement is even more remarkable considering they are based in Kashmir’s largest city Srinagar – one of the most <br/>militarised places in the world.</p>
      <p>The show and producer Greg Clark are up for two awards at the glittering ceremony in Glasgow tonight: in the Single Documentary <br/>and Director – Factual categories.</p>

      <p>Robertson, 51, who will swap his tracksuit for a tuxedo to attend the event, said: “The Bollywood company met us earlier this <br/>year in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>“They’ve been in talks and have already been around the club a lot.</p>
      <p>“They’ve obviously watched Greg’s programme and wanted to give it the Bollywood treatment.</p>
      <p>“It will be either a film or a Netflix-style series. I’m not sure who will be playing me, though.”</p>

      <p>Robertson used the f-word 92 times in the acclaimed documentary, which was made in the war-torn outpost.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Clark – who has already started filming a follow-up documentary on Robertson’s job – said he’s been stunned by the response to the programme.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve really been overwhelmed by how much coverage it got and the positive reaction to it.”</p>
