      <h1>BIDV charter capital Vietnam’s highest following stake sale - VnExpress International</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T04:40:43+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 04:40</time> by <a rel="author">VnExpress</a></address>
      <p>Its charter capital has increased by VND6 trillion ($259 million) to VND40 trillion ($1.73 billion) after the stake sale to KEB Hana Bank, it said in a statement Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Vietnamese bank, listed in the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, raised VND20.2 trillion ($872 million) from the deal by selling 603 million shares for VND33,640 ($1.45), 17 percent below the closing price on Friday.</p>
      <p>KEB Hana Bank became the largest foreign owner in BIDV after the deal, second only to the state, which saw its ownership decline to 81 percent.</p>
      <p>KEB Hana Bank is a subsidiary of South Korea’s Hana Financial Group, one of Asia’s largest with operations in 24 countries.</p>
      <p>The deal ends BIDV’s years of unsuccessful attempts to increase its capital. The other major state-owned banks are Vietcombank, Vietinbank and Agribank. The former two have charter capital of VND37 trillion ($1.6 billion) while the latter has VND30.5 trillion ($1.3 billion).</p>
      <p>In the first nine months this year BIDV's net profit fell by 3 percent year-on-year to VND5.6 trillion ($241.7 million). It had total assets as of September 30 of VND1,420 trillion ($61.28 billion), the highest of any Vietnamese bank.</p>
