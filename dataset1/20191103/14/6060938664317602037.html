      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajkummar-Rao">Rajkummar Rao</a> has to his credit stellar performances but it has not been an easy entry in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> for the actor. Speaking about his struggle in the film industry, Rajkummar Rao told Filmfare, “My struggle started in Delhi. I hail from Gurgaon and I used to travel in really crowded buses or sometimes cycle from Gurgaon to Mandi House to do theatre. My struggle started from there. When I landed in Bombay for two years, there was a lot of struggle. I would meet a lot of people and face a lot of rejection. It wasn't really an easy route.”</p>

      <p>Despite having achieved a lot of success and being referred to as a hitmaker, Rajkummar doesn’t let fame go to his head. Speaking about stardom he added, “I don't give it importance. I am very happy because I get a lot of love whenever I go anywhere now. That love is irreplaceable. A lot of gratitude for that. Apart from that when I am on sets or at home, I don't think of anything else. I just be myself. I am a very normal guy and leading a very normal life. I am just doing my job and nothing else.”</p>
      <p>Rajkummar Rao was last seen in ‘Made In China’, which released during <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diwali">Diwali</a>. Up next, the actor will be seen in social drama ‘Turram Khan’ and horror entertainer ‘Roohi Afza’.</p>
