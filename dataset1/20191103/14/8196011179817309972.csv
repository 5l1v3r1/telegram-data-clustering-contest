Energia All-Ireland League weekend round-up: Cork Con come good in last 10 mins

03 Nov 2019, 14:57

Cork Constitution came good during the final 10 minutes to overcome Terenure College 13-10 at Lakelands Park and move top of Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A.
The defending champions are now the only unbeaten team left in the top flight after a 72nd-minute penalty try for a collapsed maul, coupled with a subsequent Aidan Moynihan penalty, saw them prevail in rain-sodden conditions.
Matt D'Arcy's second half brace of tries saw Clontarf end UCC's three-match winning run, with 'Tarf triumphing 27-20 at the Mardyke. Hooker Rhys Tucker plunged over from a late lineout drive to seal Garryowen's 25-5 bonus point victory over bottom side Ballynahinch.
Despite a strong start which included a Peter Sullivan try, Lansdowne fell to their third straight loss. Full-back James Fennelly landed a late drop goal as Dublin University grabbed a memorable 13-11 win on the Aviva Stadium's back pitch.
UCD remain in the top four following a scrappy 9-9 draw with Young Munster, as David Moran matched Evan Cusack's trio of penalty goals. In Division 1B, Highfield and Old Wesley fill the top two spots having maintained their 100% records after four rounds.
The dynamism of Highfield's pack was evident again as a penalty try and three Shane O'Riordan penalties saw them win out 16-11 at St. Mary's College. Wesley won a fiercely-fought local derby clash with Old Belvedere, flanker Conor Barry's late try from a maul giving them an 11-10 victory.
Tighthead Peter Cooper touched down twice as Chris Henry's Malone side came away from Naas a 38-27 bonus point winners, out-half Cormac Fox kicked four penalties in City Armagh's 19-0 success at Navan, and Banbridge opened their win account at home to Shannon (34-14) with Ulster's Greg Jones bagging a brace.
