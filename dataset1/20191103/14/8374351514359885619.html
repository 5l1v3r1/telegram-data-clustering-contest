      <h1>Head of US autoworkers union takes leave of absence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T14:17:24+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>The head of the United Auto Workers is taking a leave of absence, the powerful US union under a federal corruption probe announced Saturday.</p>
      <p>Gary Jones asked to take leave following a vote by the union’s executive board, the UAW said in a statement. The leave will begin Sunday.</p>
      <p>The union, which has been waging high-stakes talks with the big US automakers, is being probed by the Justice Department.</p>
      <p>The FBI raided Jones’ home in August as part of the investigation. Twelve union officials have been charged, but not Jones.</p>
      <p>One of the 12, Edward Robinson, is accused of conspiring to embezzle $1.5 million from the union for personal use, CNBC reported, adding that he has ties to Jones.</p>
      <p>“The UAW is fighting tooth-and-nail to ensure our members have a brighter future. I do not want anything to distract from the mission,” Jones said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Last month the union negotiated a new contract with General Motors, after the longest automotive strike in the US in nearly 50 years.</p>
      <p>This week the UAW said it reached a tentative labor agreement with Ford, and it plans contract talks with Fiat-Chrysler.</p>
