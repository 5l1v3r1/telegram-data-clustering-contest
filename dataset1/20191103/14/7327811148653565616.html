      <p>NORTH MASSAPEQUA, Long Island -- A Long Island football coach has been suspended because his team won big - too big.</p>
      <p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/nyregion/football-coach-suspended-sportsmanship.html">reports </a>that Plainedge High School coach Robert Shaver received a one-game suspension after a Nassau County committee found he could have avoided an outsized 61-13 victory by his Red Devils against the Cyclones of South Side High School in Rockville Centre.</p>
      <p>Plainedge is in North Massapequa.</p>
      <p>A margin over 42 points triggers a review.</p>
      <p>The committee determined Shaver should have pulled his starting players as the 4th quarter began.</p>
      <p>Newsday <a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/high-school/football/plainedge-football-south-shore-1.38039566">reports </a>Shaver told the committee both teams were unbeaten, and he feared a Cyclones comeback if he took out his starters.</p>
      <p>An official with the National Federation of State High School Associations says in most places lopsided wins are typically handled by running out the clock or stopping play.</p>
