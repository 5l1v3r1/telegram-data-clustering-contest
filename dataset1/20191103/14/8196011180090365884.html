      <p>Peamount United 2 - 3 Wexford Youths</p>
      <p>Wexford retained their FAI Women’s Cup thanks to a winner from captain Kylie Murphy in a five-goal thriller against Peamount at Lansdowne Road.</p>
      <p>Twice league champions Peamount clawed Wexford back but they were unable to do so after Murphy slotted home the winner on 64 minutes.</p>
      <p>Wexford didn’t waste time in their drive to retain the trophy, firing in the opener after just three minutes.</p>
      <p>Lauren Kelly still had plenty to do when Murphy picked her out with a pass from midfield but she shrugged off the challenge of Claire Walsh and breezed past Karen Duggan to get a sight on goal.</p>
      <p>Her low shot from 20 yards fizzed through the legs of Louise Corrigan into the net, unsighting the static Niamh Reid-Burke.</p>
      <p>At the other end, Niamh Farrelly couldn’t keep her header down but Wexford remained dangerous on the break. Only a last-ditch block by Corrigan denied Rianna Jarrett a goal from point-blank range.</p>
      <p>Still, as a team with over 100 goals scored this season, Peamount carried a goal threat themselves. Áine O'Gorman, drifting in from the right onto her weaker left foot, floated an effort over on 24 minutes before the equalised eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>While Jarrett claimed the ball was out of play, referee Sarah Dyas correctly played on, allowing O'Gorman whip in a cross from the right. When Wexford failed to clear their lines, Duggan spotted the opportunity to unleash a rising shot from 20 yards which Ciamh Dolland got a hand on but couldn’t keep out.</p>
      <p>Peamount’s celebrations were short-lived as Wexford regained their lead from their next attack. Ciara Rossiter’s left-wing cross was only half-cleared, enabling Murphy to lay the ball off for Kelly to loop a half-volley over the head of the back-peddling Reid-Burke.</p>
      <p>In the style of champions, the Dubliners battled back again, showing their intent approaching the break with O’Gorman’s shot which clipped the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Pressure soon told seven minutes after the interval when they grabbed a second equaliser.</p>
      <p>Lucy McCartan’s burst from midfield opened up space and her pass to Ryan-Doyle offered a glimpse at goal. She was still 30 yards out but lofted a shot that goalkeeper Dolland couldn’t only fumble over her line.</p>
      <p>The absorbing contest continued to produce goals, with the holders notching the crucial final one eight minutes later.</p>

      <p>Once again, Kelly was involved as her crossfield pass from the left found Jarrett. The striker's neat lay-off into the path of the advancing Murphy unlocked Peas and the skipper stroked her shot into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>Jarrett could have killed off the tie with two chances, the first of which Reid-Burke repelled with her legs and the second striking the post.</p>
