《牆的時代》：「好圍籬製造好鄰居」，它講出實體上和心理上無可避免的真實界線
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是我們有能力思考、建造，也可能在圍牆之間的空間注入希望——建造橋梁。因此，目前民族主義和認同政治雖再度興起，但歷史的弧線還是可能轉回到團結。



文：提姆．馬歇爾（Tim Marshall）
結論
「已有的事，後必再有；已行的事，後必再行；陽光之下並無新鮮事。」——《傳道書》（Ecclesiastes）第一章第九節
二十一世紀初期，巴格達深陷轟炸和綁架風暴之際，我是個戰地記者，有一天和兩位同事冒險溜出綠區。當時踏出「綠區」的標準作業方式是：坐上車窗貼滿遮陽紙的破舊汽車後，就在後座乖乖窩躺下來，前座還有兩名配備長槍的保鑣護駕。我穿過由美軍士兵守衛的最後一站哨所後，每踏出一步都可能會有重大影響。每踏出一步都代表更遠離安全——萬一出了狀況，可能就叫天天不應、叫地地不靈。
綠區之外是個怪異的空間，這裡人跡罕見，沒有人真正當家管事。這裡沒有結構、沒有法律，踏進此一「無人境地」的人立刻落入「我們」或「他們」的類別。過去新聞記者被認為是中立人士，但那種時代多半已成為過去，在許多衝突中，我們成為懲罰的目標，或是待售或勒贖的牛犢。這一次，我們只踏出幾百碼，與一群平民講話，因為太緊張，就趕快退回到相對平安的綠區裡。當時的綠區頻頻遭到砲擊，但我們都認為寧可被砲彈打死，也不要落入阿布．穆沙布．札卡威（Abu Musabal- Zarqawi）率領的揮舞大刀的徒眾手中——他們就是「伊拉克凱達組織」的胚胎。
這些詭異的空間——雙方之間的空間——通常是由我們的衝突和分歧所創造出來。有時雙方還在拉鋸、爭奪它們，有時它們是雙方認可的緩衝地帶。不論是什麼性質，踏進這種區域是十分緊張的經驗。冒著生命危險而去，深知每一方都拿著武器對著你。
現代就有許多實例。賽普勒斯（Cyprus）分為兩塊地區，分由希臘裔和土耳其裔賽普勒斯人管治，中間有一塊一百一十一英里長的緩衝區。最嚴峻的是法瑪古斯塔市（Famagusta）的瓦羅夏（Varosha）地區。一九七四年，居民深恐遭到土耳其部隊屠殺，四散逃亡，再也沒有回來。瓦羅夏現在被刺絲網、守衛塔和土耳其軍隊封鎖住。這座鬼城之內，除了鳥鳴之外，靜悄悄的。街道空蕩無人，人行道荒草蔓延，許多廢棄的建築物還保留戰火毀焚的面貌。夜裡，全市沉浸在黑暗中；因為無人，當然就沒有燈光。雖然目前島上有七個地點，一方的官員會檢查你的護照，然後准你走個幾百碼到達另一方，再由另一方官員檢查護照。但你無法跨越瓦羅夏的間隔地帶。雙方都密切監視中間地帶；這塊灰色地帶不在安全、舒適的範圍之內，你一直遭到監視，只要跨過去，就是「別人」那一方。
強迫分隔和暴力對抗，是我們興建圍牆時會發生的的極端效應——它們所代表的分歧顯然也無法被克服。沒有人想要它：這樣的空間和這樣的情況令人心生恐懼，也不符合人性。在嚴密監視和威脅下，從一方走到另一方令人非常不安。
在以色列和加薩之間移動是一段冷峻、孤獨的經歷：感覺好像被困在科幻噩夢和某種實驗室的實驗之間。要從以色列過境，必須通過兩個以色列檢查哨。武裝警衛從防彈玻璃後面觀看。隨身物品必須經過徹底檢查。在長長的走廊盡頭，按下一個蜂鳴器；在門咔噠一聲打開之前，上方的攝影機一直盯著你。一踏出門，身已在加薩。但這裡沒有人；站在一個被圈圍起來的走廊裡，這是一千多碼寬的無人區域（某些地方更寬）。最後，終於完全踏進強烈的陽光下、來到灌木叢中。前方幾百碼有個巴勒斯坦檢查哨等著，儘管這裡的檢查不是那麼徹底。回程，以色列方面的檢查更為嚴格：邊防警衛從有色玻璃窗後方的攝像機嚴密監視；圍牆配置聲音和觸摸感應器；現在在機場看到的那種全身掃描儀已全面使用；行李也要徹底翻查是否藏有爆裂物。
這似乎是一種不友好或過於嚴格的例行公事，但毫無疑問，它有效用。圍牆降低了自殺炸彈客從加薩進入以色列的可能性，無人區的設計也把將以色列為目標的火箭射程推後至少一千碼。這是大家都不會覺得舒坦的事實。是的，看到加薩圍牆、孟加拉四周的障礙物、匈牙利和塞爾維亞之間的刺絲網，凡此種種，都令人難為情，也證明了我們對於解決分歧無能為力。我們很容易譴責興建圍牆的趨勢；圍牆確實可以讓人產生假象，以為棘手的問題已得到解決。不過，圍牆可以暫時並且部分地緩解問題，各國也在努力尋求更持久的解決辦法，特別是在衝突地區。加薩圍牆，配合其他許多措施，譬如金鐘罩反飛彈系統，已大大減少以色列方在衝突中的死亡人數。沙烏地與伊拉克的邊牆也有助於防堵伊斯蘭國恐怖份子的滲透。
但是，非衝突地區的圍牆該如何解釋呢？匈牙利興建刺絲網的政策，就實質意義和政治意義而言，已經降低人口移入，但不可能完全阻絕人們進來。而且大規模移民在可預見的未來也不會停止。移民是為了躲避貧窮和／或暴力，投奔更富裕、更安定的國家。固然貧窮和衝突在中東和非洲相當普及，也可能持續不斷，移民潮將持續湧至、甚至上升。全世界的人口還在增長：非洲已經普遍貧窮，但是估計在三十年之內，其人口將倍增，由目前的十二億人增加至二十四億人。因此，雖然貧窮率下降，但因為人口大增，陷入貧困之境的人數可能更多，能改變他們處境的希望與機會微乎其微。
有些富裕國家將繼續興建圍牆，以抑止外來移民湧入。然而有些人主張，不只應該拆掉圍牆，還應該廢除邊界——允許完全自由移動，讓任何人都可以隨心所欲到地球上任何地方。佛瑞斯諾太平洋大學商學院助理教授納丹．史密斯（Nathan Smith）二○一七年在《外交事務》雜誌發表文章，描述這種「開放邊界」的觀念：
一種近乎全球人口完全自由移動的體制，只有防止恐怖主義和傳染病傳播等罕有例外…… 以這種方式停止移民管制將增進自由、降低全球貧窮和加速經濟成長。但是更根本的是，它將挑戰政府基於主權此一專斷的理由管制移民的權力……更有效率的勞動分配將使得全球生產力上升，並且讓世界經濟規模幾近倍增。甚且，經濟活動如此提升後，將大大有利於全世界最貧窮的人口。
史密斯認為透過開放邊界，可以終結世界貧窮，因此可說是西方人士應盡的道義責任，尤其是從矯正歷史錯誤的角度來看。甚至還有一種觀點認為，在一國之內實踐公民權一如奴隸買賣般殘暴和歧視，將公民權利置於人權之上，就合法化了某些人比別人更有人權的觀念。如果事態如此發展，西方資源承受的壓力將會極其之大：譬如，福利國家制度實質上必須被拆除。史密斯承認，「開放邊界可能導致西方國家內可以看得見的極端貧窮大幅增加」，但他也反駁：「依據西方標準認定的貧窮，在世界上許多國家卻被認為是富足。」因此，造福數百萬人的結果當然比給西方人帶來不便和負面影響更為重要。
乍看之下，這個論述言之成理。可以說，因為一切都「拉平」了，所以合乎人道。可是，這個說法並沒有考慮到兩個關鍵因素。第一個問題是，這種大規模移動對於遭到捨棄的國家將產生什麼效應？初期的向外移民將是財力相對雄厚的人，不需要祈求人口販子幫忙、走危險的道路穿越沙漠和大海。這些國家將因為醫生、教師和其他受教育人士流失，走上衰退——不再有任何進步的前景。第二個問題是人性——或講得更白，就是團體認同。有一派樂觀的觀點是，受納這一方的民族國家將會掙扎，但是會應付，它們將吸納新來者。但是看看歷史、也看看現狀，我們可能需要對人性有更謹慎的觀點。
現實上，人口大量移動已經引爆不安：當大量外來者蜂擁而至時，本地人並不樂見。這對歐洲政治的影響顯而易見：政治上已尖銳地移向右翼和極右翼。全球亦然。我們經常在報刊上讀到文章，譴責西方國家有限制最嚴格的移民法律，和全世界最高度的種族歧視。其實他們對別的地方也很了解；其他區域也一樣反移民、暴亂、宗教不寬容和種族歧視。全世界都感受到全球化和人口大增的壓力，我們看到民族主義——俗世的和宗教的皆然——因此勃興。譬如在印度，鑒於對目前移民湧入東北地區各省的態度，我們看不到來自孟加拉的移民大增之後，兩國之間的摩擦有降低的可能。
在其他地方，自二○一四年以來，巴拉圭恩卡納雄鎮（Encarnacion）居民就被沿著阿根廷那一方河流的一道十五英尺高、一英里長的鋼筋水泥牆，和他們的阿根廷波薩達斯（Posadas）鄰人隔離開來。官方對興建圍牆的理由含糊其詞，但是脈絡卻很清楚：南美洲最自由化的這幾個國家對外來移民愈來愈焦慮。玻利維亞和巴拉圭緊鄰，玻利維亞人也移入阿根廷。這讓阿根廷北部沙爾塔省（Salta）國會議員阿佛瑞多．歐麥多（Alfredo Olmedo）說：「我們必須興建圍牆……我百分之百同意川普的看法。」
開放邊界在目前的氣氛下是行不通的——甚至在可預見的未來也行不通。當然，「民族國家」的概念是行不通的因素之一。當我們起草《外太空條約》（Outer Space Treaty）時似乎已經認知到這一點。聯合國針對太空主權所訂定的這項法律指出：外太空，包括月球和其他天體在內，不得因主權要求、透過使用或占用的手段，或其他任何手段遭到國家專用。
《 外太空條約》 規定， 外太空做為「 全體人類的領域」 開發和使用。《月球協定》（Moon Agreement）又擴大這些條款，表明：月球〔或太陽系中的其他天體〕的表面或地下，或其任何部分或自然資源，均不得成為任何國家、國際政府間組織或非政府組織、國家組織或非政府實體或任何自然人的財產。
然而，就地球而言，從頭開始為時已晚。地球和其人類居民已經太複雜，很難突然轉變為全球政府，在新體制下，解散民族國家，把全世界改成「全體人類的領域」。基於以下不同的理由，經常有人預言民族國家會死亡：全球化、類似歐盟的聯邦式超級結構、城市國家的崛起，以及最近類似比特幣等加密貨幣的興起等等。不過，民族和國家依舊生存。而且，我們所生存的民族國家世界，雖有種種瑕疵，卻可帶來相當的穩定。我們已經走過長遠的一段路，即使前途仍有漫長的路要走。我們若把第二次世界大戰之後的時代和之前的七十五年做個比較，就會發現我們的進步不小。就全球而言，識字率上升，貧窮率下降。疾病已經受到抑制，嬰兒夭折率下降，婦人難產致死率也下降。透過科學方法、民主原則和優秀領導，這項進步還可以持續下去。
然而，有一點很清楚，如果我們不能把更多資金引入到絕大多數人生活的地方，當中的許多人將試圖遷移到金錢所在之處。在立即的未來，外援預算應該增加。在近期的未來，我們需要替開發中世界訂出一個二十一世紀的馬歇爾計畫（Marshall Plan），以駕馭二十國集團國家（G20）的財富、進行全球財富重分配。第二次世界大戰的大破壞之後，馬歇爾計畫使歐洲復興重建。這是一項由美國推動的艱鉅的工程，相信雙方會因此得到裨益之下努力執行。我們現在需要一個範圍更大、雄心更大的計畫，在執行時深信將造福每一個人。這應該包括開發、基礎設施、貿易、教育、醫療和氣候變遷。
我們已經嘗到不這麼做會發生什麼狀況的苦頭。外來移民將持續、而且增長，富裕國家面臨對其本身繁榮和安定的這項「威脅」，將對他們擁有的東西——領土、服務和文化——採取更加保護的措施，更點燃民族主義運動以及興建圍牆的恐慌症。政治將變得更加醜陋、圍牆將愈蓋愈高，而且會以愈來愈暴力的手段實質性地擊退企圖跨牆而來的人。許多強硬派和仇外主義者（通常是同一人）主張零移民。從人道主義和經濟觀點來看，這都不是好事。
西方國家在中期未來需要外來移民才能維繫本身的永續發展。我說「中期」是因為我還沒有看到有任何預測指出，若是達到轉捩點——當科技取代了許多工作、不再需要大量移民時——將會是什麼狀況。但是，目前的世界需要可永續水平的移民，譬如：移民不能傾空孟加拉、造成印度動盪。但是要如何控制，我們不清楚：應該允許誰入境？——經濟移民可以裨益國家繁榮；逃躲戰禍或迫害的難民要怎麼辦呢？誰來決定哪些人歸入後者這一類型呢？應該允許多少人進來呢？
要用什麼方法把這些新來者融入而不致給本地人造成麻煩呢？絕大多數西方國家接受、甚至有些擁抱多元化。「種族純潔」的觀念早已不復存在，只限於邊緣，譬如二○一七年發生在美國維吉尼亞州夏綠蒂維爾市（Charlottes-ville）白人至上主義者的遊行。對於「他者」有任何程度的暴力都不能被接受：譬如，在德國對移民收容中心投擲火彈就是可恥的行徑。
固然絕大多數西方人不會有這種極端行為，但他們的確希望維持自身文化的基本價值。經歷數百年的流血、帝國主義和其他許多禍難之後，西方國家今天是以民主、性別平等、宗教自由和言論自由等共同信仰支撐起來的體制。很自然地，有時一個國家不依本身的文明價值行動，但是這種偽善並不代表他們的價值不復存在。大多數人所要求的是來到他們社區的人分享他們的價值，或者至少要容忍、不鼓動對抗。絕大部分的現代歐洲人不反對同性戀伴侶當鄰居，但是，反同志的鄰居若是發動仇視同性戀的行動，他們會不高興。因此我們需要找到方法讓新來者加入既有社群，不追求破壞其價值。這不是涉及種族或宗教的問題，也不是單純的禮貌問題：客人進來要摔盤子的唯一一個地方是希臘人的餐廳。以雙向關係而言，主人也有責任讓客人覺得賓至如歸，這也適用於全世界每個國家和文化的賓主相處之道。以這種方式，雙方都可以建造橋梁，彼此拉近距離。

在普世接受人類皆為兄弟、世界不再競逐資源之前，我們仍將興建圍牆。過去以來一直是如此。我們是動物。很棒、有時候也很美麗、有時候就相當醜陋，我們的能力難以想像，我們的想像力無限，但是我們仍是這個世界的造物，而且和每一種造物一樣，我們需要我們的空間。
有句諺語說：「好圍籬製造好鄰居。」這不是某種平淡的民間說法；它講出實體上和心理上無可避免的真實界線。我們規畫的未來是希望一切美好、但必須對壞事戒慎恐懼，因為戒慎恐懼，所以才興建圍牆。
然而，如果這是對人性的定論，人性還是有美好的一面。我們有能力思考、建造，也可能在圍牆之間的空間注入希望——建造橋梁。國與國之間雖有圍牆分隔，但也有資訊高速公路。雖然有蓋達組織，但也有宗教對話的外展團體。雖然有飛彈防禦系統，但也有國際太空站。富有國家捐出數十億美元救濟貧窮國家。人權的法典，至少在理論上承認凡人皆生而平等。我們建立議事廳堂集會、討論和試圖解決歧見。聯合國（United Nations）、歐盟（EU）、非洲聯盟（African Union）、東南亞國家協會（ASEAN）、南方共同市場（MERCOSUR）、石油輸出國家組織（OPEC）、北約組織（NATO）、世界銀行（the World Bank），以及數百個其他跨國和全球組織，都是為了協助團結、調停衝突而成立。國際間正式承認人權狀況，透過它們，超級大部落試圖解決歧見、維持圍牆，但同時尋求更長遠的解決方案。
因此，目前民族主義和認同政治雖再度興起，但歷史的弧線還是可能轉回到團結。

外交事務權威專家提姆．馬歇爾繼《用十張地圖看懂全球政經局勢》之後又一力作。
本書從邊界高牆探討全球幾個重要地區內部的分歧，並概述其地理、歷史、政治、宗教和其他潛在因素，以及這些因素如何發揮作用，牆又如何阻隔和禁錮彼此的關係。牆透露了許多國際政治的現況，這些地區包括：美國／墨西哥、印度／巴基斯坦／孟加拉國、以色列／加薩，以及中國、中東、非洲、歐洲內部的不穩定關係。
這個世界遠比過去更加分歧。儘管我們身處全球化和科技日新月異之中，卻更比任何時候感受到分裂。二十一世紀至少有65個國家沿著邊境興建圍牆，數千英里長的高牆和圍籬重新定義了世界局勢。二戰後興造的圍牆，有一半是在2000年之後建造的。再過幾年，歐洲國家在其邊界所興建的高牆、圍籬和屏障，其長度將超過冷戰的巔峰時期。
興建高牆的理由來自財富、種族、宗教和政治等分歧。過去十年歐洲的分歧不僅威脅到歐洲的統一，甚至在某些國家威脅其自由民主政體。中國共產黨要防堵資本主義造成內部的分歧，這將界定其國家的未來。美國主張在墨西哥邊境興建圍牆，是因為擔心非法移民讓美國不再是白人占多數的國家。
金融危機、恐怖主義、暴力衝突、難民和移民、貧富懸殊擴大等威脅，讓人們擁抱群體、區分人我，在內心築起高牆。今天我們所面臨的問題是：現代的族群以什麼形式存在？人們是以階級、種族、宗教或國籍來界定自己嗎？這些族群能在「我們與他們」這個概念猶存的世界中共存嗎？
了解過去和現在有哪些因素使我們分歧，便能了解目前世局的演變。本書詳述當今世界所面臨的地緣政治問題，作者提姆．馬歇爾的觀察涵括中國、美國、以巴衝突、中東、印度次大陸、非洲、歐洲和英國，對於影響我們未來的斷層線提出精闢的分析。

""The Age of the Wall"": ""Good fences make good neighbors"", it tells the real boundaries that are physically and psychologically inevitable
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that we have the ability to think, build, or inject hope into the space between the walls - building bridges. Therefore, although nationalism and identity politics have risen again, the arc of history may turn back to unity.



Text: Tim. Tim Marshall
in conclusion
""There will be things that will be done later; things that have already been done will be done later; there is nothing new under the sun."" - Ecclesiastes, Chapter 1, Section IX
At the beginning of the 21st century, when Baghdad was in the midst of bombing and kidnapping storms, I was a war correspondent and one day and two colleagues ventured out of the green area. At that time, the standard operation method of ""green area"" was: after sitting on the dilapidated car with the sunshade on the window, it lay down in the back seat, and there were two guards with long guns in the front seat. After I passed through the last stop guarded by US soldiers, every step taken may have a major impact. Every step of the way means being farther away from safety. If something goes wrong, it may be called refusing every day.
Outside the Green Zone is a weird space where people are rare and no one really manages to be a master. There is no structure and no law here. Those who step into this ""unmanned place"" immediately fall into the category of ""us"" or ""they"". In the past, journalists were considered to be neutrals, but that era has mostly become a thing of the past. In many conflicts, we have become the target of punishment, or the calves for sale or redemption. This time, we only took a few hundred yards and spoke to a group of civilians. Because they were too nervous, they quickly returned to the relatively peaceful green area. At that time, the green area was frequently shelled, but we all thought it would be better to be killed by artillery and not to fall into Abu. Mushabu. Abu Musabal-Zarqawi's hands in the hands of the wielding knives - they are the embryos of the Iraqi Kaida organization.
These weird spaces—the spaces between the two sides—are often created by our conflicts and differences. Sometimes the two sides are still sawing and vying for them, sometimes they are buffer zones recognized by both sides. No matter what the nature, stepping into this area is a very intense experience. Taking the risk of life, I know that each side is holding a weapon against you.
There are many examples in modern times. Cyprus is divided into two areas, governed by Greeks and Turkish Cypriots, with a 111-mile buffer in the middle. The most serious is the Varosha region of Famagusta. In 1974, residents were deeply threatened with massacres by Turkish troops, fled and fled, and never returned. Varosha is now blocked by barbed wire, guard towers and the Turkish army. In this ghost town, except for the birdsong, it is quiet. The streets are empty and the sidewalks are spreading wildly, and many abandoned buildings still retain the face of war and destruction. At night, the city is immersed in the dark; because no one, of course, there is no light. Although there are currently seven locations on the island, one of the officials will check your passport and then ask you to walk a few hundred yards to the other party, and then the other official will check the passport. But you can't cross the interval of Varosha. Both sides closely monitor the middle ground; this gray area is not within the scope of safety and comfort. You have been under surveillance, as long as you cross the past, it is the ""other"" side.
Forced separation and violent confrontation are the extreme effects that occur when we build walls. The differences they represent cannot be overcome. No one wants it: such a space and such a situation are heart-rending and not human. Under close surveillance and threats, it is very disturbing to move from one side to the other.
Moving between Israel and Gaza is a cold, lonely experience: it feels like being trapped between a science fiction nightmare and a laboratory experiment. To transit from Israel, two Israeli checkpoints must be passed. Armed guards watch from behind the bulletproof glass. Personal belongings must be thoroughly inspected. At the end of the long corridor, press a buzzer; the camera above always stares at you before the door slams open. As soon as I stepped out, I was in Gaza. But there is no one here; standing in a circled corridor, this is an unmanned area of more than a thousand yards wide (some places are wider). Finally, I finally stepped into the strong sunshine and came to the bushes. There are a Palestinian checkpoint waiting a few hundred yards ahead, although the inspection here is not so thorough. On the return trip, Israeli inspections are more stringent: the border guards are closely monitored from the cameras behind the tinted glass windows; the walls are equipped with sound and touch sensors; the full-body scanners now seen at the airport are fully operational; Check if there is a blast.
This seems to be an unfriendly or too strict routine, but there is no doubt that it works effectively. The wall reduced the possibility of suicide bombers entering Gaza from Israel, and the design of the no man's land also pushed the rocket range that targeted Israel to at least a thousand yards. This is the fact that everyone will not feel comfortable. Yes, it is embarrassing to see the walls of Gaza, the obstacles around Bangladesh, the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia, and it proves that we can’t do anything to resolve the differences. It is easy for us to condemn the trend of building a wall; the wall can indeed create illusions that the difficult problem has been solved. However, the wall can temporarily and partially alleviate the problem, and countries are also working to find more lasting solutions, especially in conflict zones. The Gaza wall, along with many other measures, such as the Golden Bell anti-missile system, has greatly reduced the number of Israeli deaths in clashes. The border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq also helps to prevent the infiltration of terrorists from the Islamic State.
But how should the walls of non-conflict areas be explained? The policy of building a barbed wire in Hungary has reduced population movements in terms of substance and political significance, but it is impossible to completely prevent people from coming in. And large-scale immigration will not stop for the foreseeable future. Immigrants are trying to escape poverty and/or violence and go to a richer, more stable country. Although poverty and conflict are widespread in the Middle East and Africa, they may continue and the tide of immigration will continue to rise and even rise. The world's population is still growing: Africa is already generally poor, but it is estimated that within 30 years, its population will double, from the current 1.2 billion to 2.4 billion. Therefore, although the poverty rate has declined, the number of people trapped in poverty may be more because of the large population, and the hopes and opportunities to change their situation are minimal.
Some rich countries will continue to build fences to curb the influx of immigrants. However, some people argue that not only should the wall be removed, but the border should be abolished – allowing full freedom of movement so that anyone can go anywhere on the planet as they please. Nathan, assistant professor of business at the University of the Pacific, Fresno. Nathan Smith published an article in Foreign Affairs magazine in 2017 to describe the concept of this ""open border"":
A system that is almost completely free to move around the world, with only rare exceptions to prevent the spread of terrorism and infectious diseases... Stopping immigration control in this way will increase freedom, reduce global poverty and accelerate economic growth. But more fundamentally, it will challenge the government's power to regulate immigration based on the arbitrariness of sovereignty... More efficient labor distribution will increase global productivity and nearly double the size of the world economy. Moreover, economic activities will be greatly enhanced, which will greatly benefit the world's poorest population.
Smith believes that through the open border, it can end the world's poverty, so it can be said that the Westerners should do their moral duty, especially from the perspective of correcting historical errors. There is even a view that the practice of citizenship within a country is as brutal and discriminatory as slave trade, placing civil rights above human rights, and legalizing the notion that some people have more human rights than others. If the situation develops, the pressure on Western resources will be extremely great: for example, the welfare state system must essentially be dismantled. Smith admits that ""open borders may lead to a significant increase in visible extreme poverty in Western countries,"" but he also refutes: ""Poverty based on Western standards is considered rich in many countries around the world."" The results of millions of people are of course more important than the inconvenience and negative impact on Westerners.
At first glance, this argument is justified. It can be said that because everything is ""flattened"", it is humane. However, this statement does not take into account two key factors. The first question is, what effect will this massive movement have on countries that have been abandoned? The initial immigration will be a relatively wealthy person, and there is no need to ask the traffickers to help and take dangerous roads through the desert and the sea. These countries will be embarrassed by the loss of doctors, teachers and other educated people – there is no longer any prospect of progress. The second problem is humanity - or speaking whiter, is group identity. There is an optimistic view that the nation-states that accept this side will struggle, but will cope, and they will absorb newcomers. But looking at history and looking at the status quo, we may need to be more cautious about human nature.
In reality, the massive movement of the population has already ignited uneasiness: when a large number of outsiders flocked, locals were not happy. This has an obvious impact on European politics: politically sharply moved to the right and the extreme right. The same is true of the world. We often read articles in the press, condemning Western countries for the most restrictive immigration laws and the highest level of racial discrimination in the world. In fact, they are also very familiar with other places; other areas are also anti-immigration, riots, religious intolerance and racial discrimination. The world is feeling the pressure of globalization and population growth. We see that nationalism – both secular and religious – is so prosperous. For example, in India, given the current immigration attitude towards the provinces in the northeastern region, we do not see the possibility of a reduction in friction between the two countries after the immigration of Bangladesh has increased.
Elsewhere, since December 2014, the residents of Encarnacion in Paraguay have been along a 15-foot-high, one-mile-long reinforced concrete wall along the Argentine side of the river, and their Argentine waves. The neighbors of Posadas are isolated. The official reason for the construction of the wall is vague, but the veins are clear: the most liberalized countries in South America are increasingly anxious about immigration. Bolivia and Paraguay are in close proximity, and Bolivians have also moved to Argentina. This allowed Afrido, a member of the Parliament of Salta province in northern Argentina. Alfredo Olmedo said: ""We must build a fence... I agree with Trump 100%.""
Open borders are not going to work in the current atmosphere – even in the foreseeable future. Of course, the concept of a ""nation state"" is one of the factors that does not work. It seems to have been recognized when we drafted the Outer Space Treaty. The United Nations’ law on space sovereignty states that outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, must not be used exclusively by the state for sovereignty claims, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.
The Outer Space Treaty stipulates that outer space is developed and used as ""the domain of all human beings"". The Moon Agreement extends these provisions to show that the surface or underground of the moon (or other celestial bodies in the solar system), or any part of it or natural resources, must not become any country, international intergovernmental organization or non-government. The property of an organization, national organization or non-governmental entity or any natural person.
However, as far as the earth is concerned, it is too late to start from scratch. The earth and its human inhabitants are too complicated to suddenly turn into a global government. Under the new system, the national state is dissolved and the world is changed into the ""all human domain."" For different reasons, it is often predicted that nation-states will die: globalization, federal-like superstructures like the European Union, the rise of urban nations, and the recent rise of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. However, the nation and the country still survive. Moreover, the nation-state world in which we live, despite all kinds of embarrassment, can bring considerable stability. We have already gone through a long way, even if the future still has a long way to go. If we compare the era after the Second World War with the previous seventy-five years, we will find that our progress is not small. Globally, literacy rates have risen and poverty rates have fallen. The disease has been suppressed, the rate of infant mortality has decreased, and the mortality rate of women with dystocia has also declined. Through scientific methods, democratic principles and excellent leadership, this progress can continue.
However, it is clear that if we can't introduce more money into the place where most people live, many of them will try to move to where the money is. In the immediate future, the foreign aid budget should increase. In the near future, we need to set up a 21st century Marshall Plan for the developing world to harness the wealth of the G20 countries and redistribute global wealth. After the great destruction of the Second World War, Marshall plans to rebuild Europe. This is an arduous project promoted by the United States. I believe that both parties will work hard to achieve this. We now need a larger, more ambitious plan that is convinced that it will benefit everyone. This should include development, infrastructure, trade, education, health care and climate change.
We have already tasted the bitterness of what would happen if we didn't do this. Immigrants will continue and grow, and rich countries face this “threat” of their own prosperity and stability. They will take more protective measures against what they have – territory, services and culture – and ignite the nationalist movement. And the fear of building a wall. Politics will become more ugly, the walls will become more and more high, and people will attempt to substantially repel those who attempt to cross the wall in an increasingly violent manner. Many hardliners and xenophos (usually the same person) advocate zero immigration. From a humanitarian and economic point of view, this is not a good thing.
Western countries need foreign immigrants in the medium term to maintain their sustainable development. I say ""mid-term"" because I haven't seen any predictions about what would happen if it was to achieve a turning point - when technology replaced a lot of work and no longer needed a lot of immigrants. However, the current world needs immigrants of sustainable levels, such as immigrants who cannot vacate Bangladesh and cause instability in India. But how to control, we do not know: Who should be allowed to enter? -- Economic immigrants can benefit the country's prosperity; what should refugees escape from war or persecution? Who decides which type of person belongs to the latter? How many people should be allowed to come in?
What methods should be used to integrate these newcomers without causing trouble to local people? Most Western countries accept and even embrace diversity. The concept of ""ethnic purity"" has long ceased to exist, only on the edge, such as the parade of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA in 2017. Any degree of violence against the ""other"" cannot be accepted: for example, it is a shameful act to throw a firebomb at a immigration shelter in Germany.
Although most Westerners do not have such extreme behavior, they do want to maintain the basic value of their culture. After hundreds of years of bloodshed, imperialism and many other evils, Western countries today are supported by a common belief in democracy, gender equality, religious freedom and freedom of speech. Naturally, sometimes a country does not act according to its own civilized values, but this hypocrisy does not mean that their value no longer exists. What most people ask is that people who come to their community share their value, or at least tolerate and not encourage confrontation. Most modern Europeans do not oppose gay couples as neighbors, but if anti-comrades' neighbors act to launch homophobia, they will be upset. So we need to find ways to get newcomers to join existing communities without sacrificing their value. This is not a matter of race or religion, nor is it a pure polite question: the only place where guests come in to drop a plate is the Greek restaurant. In terms of two-way relationship, the owner also has the responsibility to make the guests feel at home. This also applies to the way the guests of every country and culture in the world get along. In this way, both sides can build bridges and get closer to each other.

We will continue to build walls until the universal acceptance of human beings as brothers and the world no longer competing for resources. This has been the case in the past. We are animals. It's great, sometimes beautiful, sometimes quite ugly, our ability is hard to imagine, our imagination is unlimited, but we are still the creation of this world, and like every creation, we need our space.
There is a saying that ""good fences make good neighbors."" This is not a dull folk saying; it speaks the real boundaries that are physically and psychologically inevitable. The future of our planning is to hope that everything is good, but we must be cautious about the bad things, because we are afraid of fear, so we build the wall.
However, if this is a conclusion about human nature, humanity still has a beautiful side. We have the ability to think, build, or inject hope into the space between the walls – building bridges. Although there are walls separated by country, there are also information highways. Although there are al-Qaeda organizations, there are also outreach groups for religious dialogue. Although there is a missile defense system, there are also international space stations. Rich countries donate billions of dollars to help poor countries. The code of human rights, at least in theory, recognizes that all people are born equal. We set up a meeting, discussion and attempt to resolve differences. United Nations, European Union (EU), African Union (African Union), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), NATO (NATO), World Bank (the World Bank), as well as hundreds of other transnational and global organizations, were formed to help unite and mediate conflicts. Internationally, the human rights situation is formally recognized, through which the super-big tribes try to resolve differences and maintain the wall, but at the same time seek longer-term solutions.
Therefore, although nationalism and identity politics have risen again, the arc of history may turn back to unity.

Foreign affairs authority expert Tim. Marshall continued his efforts after ""using ten maps to understand the global political and economic situation.""
This book explores the differences within several important regions of the world from the high walls of the border and outlines its geography, history, politics, religion, and other underlying factors, and how these factors work, and how the walls block and impede each other's relationships. The wall reveals the current state of international politics, including: the United States/Mexico, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Israel/Gaza, and unstable relations within China, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
This world is far more divided than in the past. Although we are in the midst of globalization and technology, we feel more divided than ever. At least 65 countries in the 21st century built fences along the border, and thousands of miles of high walls and fences redefine the world. Half of the walls built after World War II were built after 2000. In a few years, the heights, fences and barriers that European countries have built on their borders will exceed the peak of the Cold War.
The reasons for the construction of the high walls come from differences in wealth, race, religion and politics. The differences in Europe over the past decade have not only threatened the unification of Europe, but even threatened its liberal democracy in some countries. The Chinese Communist Party wants to prevent capitalism from causing internal differences, which will define the future of its country. The United States advocates the construction of a wall on the Mexican border because of fears that illegal immigration would make the United States no longer a white-majority country.
The threats of financial crisis, terrorism, violent conflicts, refugees and immigrants, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor have made people embrace groups, distinguish people and build high walls in the heart. The question we face today is: What form does the modern ethnic group exist in? Do people define themselves by class, race, religion or nationality? Can these ethnic groups coexist in the world where the concept of ""we and them"" still exists?
Knowing the past and present factors that make us different, we can understand the evolution of the current world. This book details the geopolitical issues facing the world today, author Tim. Marshall's observations include China, the United States, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Europe and the United Kingdom, providing an incisive analysis of the fault lines that affect our future.
