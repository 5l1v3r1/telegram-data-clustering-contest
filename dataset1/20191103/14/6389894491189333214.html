      <h1>Labour to spend £60bn on household energy programme</h1>

      <p>The Labour party this morning announced a £60bn programme of housing improvements designed to cut carbon emissions 10 per cent by 2030.</p>
      <p>The initiative, which is the largest upgrade of UK households since the post-war reconstruction, will create 450,000 jobs by installing energy saving measures in almost all of the UK’s 27m homes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Labour estimate that the measures will bring energy bills for 9.6m low income households down by an average of £417 a year.</p>
      <p>They will also prevent 1,500 deaths from cold weather and up to 560,000 cases of asthma due to a reduction in damp.</p>
      <p>This comes on the back of Friday evening’s announcement that all new homes would be made carbon neutral in the next three years, saving residents £200 a year in energy bills.</p>
      <p>Labour said they would introduce a “zero carbon standard” through triple-glazing, more efficient insulation, and non-gas boilers.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said that the £60bn upfront investment would be taken from Labour’s £250bn national transformation fund.</p>
      <p>She stressed that there would be no upfront cost for participants in the scheme. Those with low incomes would be able to take out a grant to pay for the improvements, whereas those better off could apply for an interest free loan.</p>
      <p>In a statement, she said: “Labour will offer every household in the UK the chance to bring the future into their homes – upgrading the fabric of their homes with insulation and cutting edge heating systems – tackling both climate change and extortionate bills.</p>
      <p>“This project will also create hundreds of thousands of good unionised construction jobs, bringing good work back to areas of the UK the Tories abandoned long ago.”</p>
      <p>A Conservative party statement said: “Jeremy Corbyn’s plans would wreck the economy, putting up bills for hardworking families – and preventing any real progress on climate change.</p>
      <p>“Tackling climate change is vital but independent experts and even Labour’s own unions say their promises don’t stack up.</p>
      <p>“Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives have a proper plan to continue reducing carbon emissions faster than any other G20 country.”</p>
      <p>On 24 October senior energy industry figures cast doubt on a Labour-commissioned report setting out the “most radical feasible pathway” to reach zero-carbon by 2030.</p>
      <p>The report said that the move would require £150bn in up-front capital, followed by investment of 2 per cent each year.</p>

      <p>Neil Cornelius, managing director of consultancy Berkeley Research Group, said: “The proposals are a mix of those which are clearly economically beneficial and those of questionable economic benefit. </p>
      <p>“I do not believe that the activities outlined would not represent a cost increase for the energy system and this cost would have to be met by someone. I have doubts about the economics presented. </p>
