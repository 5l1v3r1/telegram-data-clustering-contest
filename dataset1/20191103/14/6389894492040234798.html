      <p>Former business minister and Tory rebel Margot James will not stand at next month’s general election due to insufficient support from her local Conservative party.</p>
      <p>James was one of 21 Tory MPs to have the party whip removed in September for voting with opposition parties to stop a no-deal Brexit.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Stourbridge MP had the whip restored on Tuesday, along with nine others, but is still stepping due to a lack of support from her local party.</p>
      <p>Stourbridge, her constituency, voted 64 per cent to leave in the Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>She wrote in a resignation letter to Boris Johnson that “it meant a great deal” to have the whip restored.</p>
      <p>She added: “I am fortunate to have considerable support in my constituency, but sadly the opposite is the case among too many members of the Stourbridge Conservative Association.</p>
      <p>“It was only after a period of reflection I realised that I needed to bring the three and a half year conflict between the result of the referendum in my constituency, and my own view of where the future interests of the country lie to a close.”</p>
      <p>James was elected as an MP in 2010 and served as a business minister and then subsequently digital and creative industries minister under Theresa May.</p>
      <p>Her decision to not stand at the 12 December election comes after a number of female MPs have cited abuse as a reason to quit politics.</p>
      <p>A study by the Commons’ Women and Equalities Committee found two-thirds of female MPs say that slow progress tackling violence against women in politics is impacting their willingness to stand for re-election.</p>
      <p>Tory grandee Nicholas Soames lamented James’ decision to resign.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: “That is so sad and a real loss to the house and her constituency.”</p>

      <p>Former Conservative, and now Liberal Democrat, MP Sam Gyimah said: “Very sad to see my good friend, Margot James, will not be standing at the next general election.</p>
      <p>“Yet another thoughtful, compassionate, moderate MP, who voted against no deal – now she has no place in the Conservative Party.”</p>
