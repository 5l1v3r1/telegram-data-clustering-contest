      <h1>Beto O'Rourke's 'Passion' for Gun Control 'Inspiring' for Joe Biden</h1>
      <h2>Hours after Robert “Beto” O’Rourke ended his campaign for the Democrat presidential nomination, Joe Biden tweeted that O’Rourke’s “passion” for gun control was “inspiring.”</h2>

      <p>O’Rourke’s gun control efforts were characterized by a pledge to confiscate AR-15 and AK-47 rifles. He clearly stated it on September 12, 2019, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/12/beto-orourke-hell-yes-were-going-to-take-your-ar-15/">saying</a>, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15,” then stood behind the pledge by telling MSNBC the confiscatory policy would be “<a href="https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1172471677818736640">mandatory</a>” not voluntary.</p>
      <p>Days later, CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked O’Rourke if he was really intent on confiscating certain firearms. O’Rourke <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/19/beto-orourke-on-cnn-i-will-not-confiscate-hunting-rifles/">answered</a>, “Yes” and emphasized his confiscatory goals were centered on AR-15 and AK-47 rifles and their variants.</p>
      <p>On October 16, 2019, Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/16/beto-law-enforcement-visit-non-compliant-recover-ar-15s/">reported</a> O’Rourke’s admission law enforcement would be sent to the visit those who refused to comply with the AR-15 ban.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://twitter.com/RNCResearch/status/1184456317911613440">MSNBC’s <i>Morning Joe</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>I think just as, in any law that is not followed, or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences, or else there is no respect for the law. In that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be, potentially used against someone else.</blockquote>
      <p>O’Rourke’s confiscation plans did not translate into support in the polls and he dropped out of the race on Friday, November 1.</p>
      <p>Biden reacted to O’Rourke’s decision to pull out by <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1190409181406355457">tweeting</a> about O’Rourke’s “leadership” and specifically declaring that “his passion for solving our gun crisis has been inspiring to anyone who has seen him.”</p>
