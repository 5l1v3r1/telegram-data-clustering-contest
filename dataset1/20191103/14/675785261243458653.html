      <h1>Arsenal respond to claims Jose Mourinho 'dined' with club chief Raul Sanllehi</h1>
      <h2>Reports on Monday suggested the self-styled Special One had met with Gunners chief Sanllehi</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T14:34:55+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have refuted claims Jose Mourinho 'dined' with club chief Raul Sanllehi amid growing speculation over the future of Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners dropped yet more points in front of their home fans on Saturday as they surrendered a 1-0 lead to only draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>It marked a third game in succession without tasting victory following the defeat on penalties by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the Carabao Cup in a crazy game which finished 5-5 after 90 minutes and a 2-2 draw at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> could end the weekend six points adrift of the top four and are already 14 points off the title pace having won just four of their opening 11 fixtures.</p>

      <p>Media reports on Sunday morning suggested Mourinho had recently met with Sanllehi with the self-styled Special One being touted as a potential successor to Emery.</p>
      <p>But, according to <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/arsenal-refute-claims-of-mourinho-meeting-as-pressure-mounts/3czuf810kul71vlijfybkc5pb">Goal,</a> Arsenal insist the reported meeting never took place - and that Mourinho and Sanllehi have in fact not met for a number of years.</p>
      <p>When asked after the Wolves game if he thought his job was under threat, Emery said: "I am very demanding myself and I feel my responsibility to work every time to come back with a better result in the next matches.</p>

      <p>On the match itself, the Spaniard added: "Itâ€™s disappointing. I think the players tried and we scored the first goal but we needed a second for more confidence.</p>
      <p>"Wolves are consistent in playing matches like they did today and they did that again. It was an equal match and maybe we deserved more.</p>
      <p>"I am frustrated because we are dropping points at home like we did last year. We can improve that balance defensively.</p>
      <p>"But the key was to have more clear chances to take the result for us. The players feel the responsibility to win and when we draw they are sad. I think they understand me."</p>
