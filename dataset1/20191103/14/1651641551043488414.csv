Diablo IV will require internet access at all times
03 Nov 2019, 14:51 by Ash

The recently announced Diablo IV is set to be an online exclusive, requiring a constant internet connection at all times, regardless of which game mode you choose to play.

A Blizzard representative confirmed to GameSpot that every version of Diablo 4 will be online-only, regardless of whether you’re on PC, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One.
That means that even if you want to tackle the entire game solo and never interact with any other players, you’ll still require a constant internet connection in order to play.
It’s not currently known whether the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game will require PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold to play, or whether players will be able to get away with just having a stable internet connection.
Diablo IV was officially announced during BlizzCon 2019. The announcement came accompanied by a gory cinematic, which you can watch below.



If you don’t have time to watch it or if you simply don’t want to, here’s a plot run down: the cinematic shows several adventurers entering a temple with their sights set on treasure.
However, instead of treasure, they each come across their various untimely ends – save for one, who it turns out was actually the mastermind behind the whole bloody scheme.
The last adventurer then proceeds to summon the demon known Lilith, a female Diablo. Then, with his quest completed, the last adventurer departs this mortal coil.
Diablo IV will release on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. There’s no set release date right now, but it’ll most likely come out in 2020.
