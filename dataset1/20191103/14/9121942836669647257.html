      <p>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Cristián “Portu” Portugués scored two goals to give Real Sociedad a 2-1 win at Granada as his team pulled level on points with Barcelona and Real Madrid at the crowded top of the Spanish league on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sociedad’s fourth victory in seven away matches moved it into third place, behind the league’s two traditional powerhouses on goal difference.</p>
      <p>Atlético Madrid and Sevilla are one point behind. Granada fell to sixth place at two points off the pace after missing a chance to retake the league lead with a win.</p>
      <p>Granada, the surprise of the season after returning to the top flight, had kept four straight clean sheets at home before Portu struck his first goal in the 21st from a pass by Mikel Oyazabal.</p>
      <p>Álvaro Vadillo equalized in the 36th with a free kick that Alejandro Remiro let bounce in front of him, hit his hands, and slip past in a glaring error by the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>But Sociedad coach Imanol Aguacil made attacking substitutions to go for the full three points. The move paid off when late substitute Adnan Januzai helped Portu to grab the 89th-minute winner.</p>

      <p>Both of the visitors’ goals came after pressure forced poor passes from Granada’s defenders.</p>
      <p>“I am happy for the goals, but also to be able to look at the standings and see us at the top,” Portu said.</p>
      <p>Sociedad was without top playmaker Martin Odergaard, who is nursing a right foot injury.</p>
