《牆的時代》：川普關於邊境圍牆的言論，掀起對「美國」的狹隘定義
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是「差異」的概念現在遭到左翼和右翼兩派人士操弄；這種認同政治正加劇美國的分歧。在美國歷史上的這個時刻，雖然藉由立國精神團結在一起，但許多團體仍然相互撕裂，這也可以從政治舞台上愈來愈多的分歧中看出來。



文：提姆．馬歇爾（Tim Marshall）
過去幾任美國總統也曾經加強美墨邊境防務，但是川普的圍牆特別具有分裂意涵，因為它代表的是美國歷史一個特殊的時刻。興建高牆的政治意涵不只是要擋住墨西哥人、不讓他們進來。邊境界定一個國家，川普的牆試圖界定美國在實質上和意識形態上是什麼樣的國家。要了解它如何反映及深化歷史分歧，我們需要檢視使國家分歧的其他裂縫。
美國所有的分歧中，最廣泛的分歧是種族歧異。美國人口約為三億二千四百萬人。根據中央情報局《世界概況》（World Factbook），以二○一○年人口普查為準，其中百分之七二．四為白人，百分之十二．六為黑人，百分之四．八為亞洲裔，只有不到百分之一是美洲印第安人和阿拉斯加原住民。「兩個以上種族的人口」占百分之二．九，夏威夷原住民及其他太平洋島民只有百分之○．二，「其他」則為百分之六．二。大家一定注意到這裡竟然沒有人數一直增長的西班牙語裔，這是因為美國聯邦人口普查局認為，西班牙語裔指的是具有西班牙人／西班牙語／或拉丁人血統的人，他「可能歸屬於任何人種或族裔團體」。這個複雜不同的團體是美國最大的少數民族，占全美人口大約百分之十七。
在二十一世紀這個數字還會持續增長。我們已經看到，白人占半數以上人口的比例，在這個極力掙扎要全面融合的國家裡正在消退，尤其是南方各州。人口估計的數字各異，但是絕大多數專家都認為，白人占半數以上的情形在幾十年內即將不復存在。包括西班牙語裔在內，非白人目前約占全美國人口百分之四十，預測這個比例到了二○五○年將上升為百分之五十三，而西班牙語裔為百分之二十九左右，因此將會是未來三十年增長最為快速的族裔。對於那些認為此一趨勢足堪憂慮的人而言，興建高牆和可能制止移民潮是遏止這種人口變化的希望所在，儘管實際上它扭轉不了多大情勢。
然而，反移民的論調，往往又伴隨著支持興建高牆，在美國人民之中製造更大的緊張。外來移民通常被貼上負面標籤，川普把他們稱作「壞蛋」：「當墨西哥送人出來時，他們不會送出最優秀的人……他們送出有許多問題的人，他們把這些問題帶給我們。他們帶來毒品和犯罪，他們是強暴犯。不過，我猜有些人是好人。」這類型的言論造成過去十年來對拉丁裔的歧視大幅上升。譬如，二○一六年的皮優研究調查，發現百分之五十二的西班牙語裔宣稱他們因為族裔關係，受到不公平待遇；在十八至二十九歲這一群組中，數字更攀升到百分之六十五。有趣的是，同樣數字也發生在黑人相同年齡群組中，但就整體西班牙語裔而言，比起黑人，說他們遭遇種族歧視的人數少了很多。
毫無疑問，種族平等上已有長足的進步，每天有數千萬不同膚色的美國人，快樂地共存、交往、共餐、工作和玩樂在一起。不過，種族歧視仍是全國各地的主要問題。
雖然快速增長的西班牙語裔肯定受到歧視，但美國最明顯的種族分歧卻出現在白人和黑人之間。這個問題源自於蓄奴時期，一直持續到今天。它對人們生活的負面效應非常清晰：幾乎從所有的指標來看，在美國生而為黑人，注定比生而為白人要更加貧窮、受更少教育、也比較不健康。當然這並非普世真理：富裕的黑人、中產階級和市郊家庭，很可能比貧窮的白人農村家庭子弟有更多的機會。布魯金斯研究院有一項研究說，不論你是白人、黑人或西班牙語裔出身，如果你出身貧窮家庭，即使有大學學歷，你下半輩子的所得還是低於來自富裕家庭的人。
話雖如此，這幾乎是個定律，在人生的樂透中，如果你是黑人，勝率不高。到目前為止還是很清楚，歷史上和當今的種族歧視，在族裔團體令人驚訝的差異還是個主要因素。在生命一開始時，可能就是如此。全世界最富有的國家當中，白人的嬰兒夭折率是千分之四．八，但是黑人就高達千分之十一．七——大約相當於墨西哥這樣的中等國家。
健康不如人、財富不如人、前景不如人，全都造成教育程度不如人，這點早在兩歲時就很明顯。根據經濟合作發展組織（OECD）和美國教育部門的統計，在兩歲時，黑人嬰童展現熟諳發展技能的比例就比較低。到了三至五歲時，在閱讀能力方面，這個差距又略為上升；一般認為可能的因素是：黑人家庭相對缺少閱讀材料，父母沒有時間讀點東西給子女聽，以及可能因為某些非白人的特質、對書本缺乏興趣所致。我們從學校系統逐年級往上看，可以發現美國黑人的輟學率或遭開除率是白人學生的三倍。在學生過半數以上是少數民族的學校，老師也往往比較欠缺經驗，薪水也較低。
在這些數字背後通常就是低收入、單親家庭的日常生活實況。百分之二十五的黑人家長表示，他們的子女生活在不安全的街坊，白人家長如此表示的只有百分之七。等到到達畢業年齡時，我們發現美國黑人輟學離開中學的機率是白人學生的兩倍。有一項研究指出，如果把美國白人和黑人高中學生的受教育率，分開來當做兩個不同國家比較，前者相當於英國、後者相當於智利。到了大學層級，百分之三六．二的白人完成學位，反之，黑人只有百分之二二．五。帶著大學學歷進入工作職場，黑人賺的錢比較少。美國黑人入獄坐牢的比例也比較高：黑人占全美人口百分之十四，可是坐牢服刑者百分之三十八為黑人。
由此可見，從搖籃到墳墓，相對於歐洲，美國是個暴力激烈的國家，但如果是黑人，這是一個更加危險的地方。白人人口的謀殺率是每十萬人有二．五人死亡。美國黑人則是十九．四人，相當於許多第三世界或開發中國家。統計數字容或有異，但是根據有線電視新聞網（CNN）的調查，年輕的黑人男性，比白人年輕男子遭到警察射殺死亡的可能性為將近三倍，難怪美國黑人的平均壽命比白人少四歲。由於近年來並未持械的黑人男性遭射殺的人數大增，這些驚人的數字在全美各地引爆動亂和抗議——譬如，二○一四年的佛格森市（Ferguson）事件——也造成「黑人的命也是命」（Black Lives Matter）運動之興起。官方和社區的反應在每次事件後都受到嚴密檢討，這也成為愈來愈分歧的議題。
凸顯這些問題的數據很容易找到，要說明清楚成因則相當困難，顯然種族歧視仍存在於美國社會。我們不可能不談開端肇因——奴隸制度。奴隸已經獲得解放，但絕大多數被棄置於赤貧狀況，遭遇社會歧視；在這種情況下，他們很難快快達成與主流人民的平等。多久算快？黑奴獲得自由已經超過一百五十年，儘管有許多進步、尤其是過去五十年，但是令人驚訝的是仍有許多不足之處有待改進。

當然，種族不是美國唯一的分歧。譬如，談到宗教，美國有一個強大的優勢就是它是個世俗國家，有各式各樣的民間宗教信仰和禮拜場所。美國人的信仰絕大多數是基督教，底下再分為許多不同的新教徒教派和天主教，但是自從一九六○年代以來又增加信徒眾多的其他信仰。大約百分之八十的美國人認同自己是基督徒，新教徒最多，約占全國人口百分之四十六．六。其次是天主教徒，占百分之二十．八。接下來是猶太教（百分之一．九）、摩門教（百分之一．六）、穆斯林（百分之○．九）、佛教（百分之○．七）、印度教（百分之○．七），以及眾多其他小教派。
這一切是否已讓美國等同是大熔爐？只到某一程度。儘管有一些刺眼的不一致和偽善的例子，理想的「合眾為一」精神則維持在相當程度上。即使如此，進入本世紀，在多族裔社會之內融合同化的精神受到多元文化主義的挑戰。種族和族裔的分歧進入美國社會的許多裂縫，以致於出現困擾共和國的認同政治。愈來愈多美國人依據他們的族裔、宗教和性別取向認同自己，因此更加極化及分裂國家。不同的族裔都被鼓勵維持明白的認同意識；這個作法沒有導致接受多元化，反而在某些案例上造成某些群體和其餘社會隔離，而在某個程度上，使得他們愈來愈遭到歧視。
我們在二○一六年總統大選期間看到這個現象。胡馬雲．罕恩（Humayun Kahn）是在伊拉克為國捐軀的美國穆斯林軍人，獲頒勛章。胡馬雲的父親發聲、反對川普禁止穆斯林移民的政見之後，川普批評這對父母。卡濟爾和賈莎拉罕恩（Khizrand Ghazala Kahn）夫婦是美國人通稱的「金星父母」。這個名詞可以上溯到第一次世界大戰時期，美國家庭若有子弟、丈夫在海外作戰，會掛出有藍星的國旗。如果這位家屬不幸殉難，藍星就會換成金星。
這對父母如果是白人基督徒，川普口頭抨擊的口吻就不會如此激烈。在美國政治上，由於家屬為國捐軀，對金星父母通常是不能批評的。川普聲稱他在美國創造許多就業機會，也為國家「犧牲良多」。他暗諷罕恩太太的先生未允許她發言，藉此暗示這是他們的宗教作祟。他根本不管罕恩先生曾經帶著兒子胡馬雲到傑佛遜紀念堂參訪，向他灌輸紀念堂裡的一段文字——「我們相信這些真理是不證自明，即人人生而平等……」候選人川普的評論弦外之音似乎是，這對金星父母和其他金星家庭不一樣。他的訴求的確有一部分美國人也認同——這些人以非常狹隘的方式界定何謂美國人。共和黨籍聯邦參議員約翰．馬侃（John McCain）在越戰期間曾經淪為戰俘，當他批評川普時，說出了其他美國人的心聲。馬侃說：「當我們的黨提名他時，並沒有附贈他不受拘束的許可用以汙衊我們當中的菁英。」
「差異」的概念現在遭到左翼和右翼兩派人士操弄；這種認同政治正加劇美國的分歧。在美國歷史上的這個時刻，雖然藉由立國精神團結在一起，但許多團體仍然相互撕裂，這也可以從政治舞台上愈來愈多的分歧中看出來。
在川普／桑德斯／柯林頓二○一六年大混戰的前兩年，皮優研究中心進行了歷來最大規模對於美國人政治態度的調查。調查發現人們的觀點愈來愈堅持己見，而且愈來愈不願意接受其他人的意見。譬如，積極參與政治的民主黨人有百分之三十八，自認為是「持續一致的自由派」，比起一九九四年的百分之八，高出太多。同時，有百分之三十三的共和黨人自認為是「持續一致的保守派」，比起二十年前的百分之二十三，也有增加。更令人擔心的是，愈來愈多共和黨人和民主黨人互相蔑視，特別是那些積極參與政治的黨員。一九九四年，百分之十七的共和黨人對民主黨人有「非常」不良的印象，現在卻激升到百分之四十三；反之，民主黨人對共和黨人有「非常」不良印象的，從百分之十六激升到百分之三十八。
這種現象有其地理因素。堅定的民主黨籍選民愈來愈集中在大型都會城市，共和黨人則集中在小城鎮和農村地區。拉斯維加市內華達大學教授普瑞斯東．史多瓦爾（Preston Stovall）撰文提到「城市全球主義者」（urban globalist）和「非城市國家主義者」（non-urban nationalist）。他認為這兩個名詞比「民主黨人」和「共和黨人」更貼切地反映分化的現象。他嘆息非城市的想法「被貶抑為愚蠢無知」，而城市的想法則「被認為是菁英的思想、可是卻道德墮落」。
我很驚訝城市美國人竟然如此輕視農村和農業社區。我不記得何時出現過美國人對農村如此隨意詆毀，被輕易默認或接受……我們必須避免把共和黨選民視為未受教育的種族主義者，而民主黨選民是菁英主義惡人的傾向。
有一點很重要，我們應該記得，這些名詞和統計數字絕大部分涉及積極參與政治者；在意識形態的堡壘和迴音箱之外，一般人都較能接受其他人的意見，也有更大的意願進行折衷妥協。即使如此，愈來愈不能容忍相反意見的趨勢，已導致我們在主流中聽到愈來愈暴戾的言論，也在網路上看到愈來愈尖銳的言論。過去三大電視網晚間新聞快報的寧靜播報，已變成二十四小時政治互鬥的有線新聞頻道，相互叫罵，而在沒有管制的網路上，辱罵對手、取人性命的威脅也成為常態。二十四小時不停的社群媒體平台的崛起，也讓極端份子有了擴聲器，而一般新聞媒體更是強化此一擴聲器的音量，給人一種印象，美國人不斷地互相爭吵廝殺（或者天天發推特），但事實上絕大多數美國人彼此和睦相處。現在，最不能容忍的某些人反而是年輕世代，許多年輕人對現在言論自由的理想相當反感，認為這涉及到他們不能同意其意見的人政治不容忍是被允許的。
美國教育體系內也出現極端主義，一小撮學生在某些教授支持下推動著。大多數老一輩學人的表現愈來愈像被車燈照到的兔子，革命派的子弟反過來對抗那些教導他們如此意識形態偏執的前輩。這在美國形成了汙穢的學術氣氛，強悍者以霸凌姿態咄咄逼人，怯弱的知識份子教授則潰不成軍。這些強悍者對凝聚力構成危險，因為他們的活動十分尖銳，言論與行動又在網路討論中被放大。如果愈來愈多學生在離開學校時已經激進化，不論是往左或往右演變，都可能會出現極端思想愈來愈普及的危險。
最好的一個案例出現在二○一七年華盛頓州的長青州立學院（Evergreen State College）。自由派白人教授布瑞特．衛恩斯坦（Bret Weinstein）反對學校每有教職出缺，雇用新人時都需就種族背景提出說明的主張。他也和一個學生團體意見相左，這個學生團體要求學校要訂定某一天白人學生不應上學，以便創造安全的環境，讓有色人種學生能暢所欲言辯論議題。他的教室旋即被學生闖入，高喊種族歧視和白人特權。他們要求開除他和另兩名職員。當校長喬治．布理吉斯（George Bridges）試圖調停時，卻一再遭到咒罵、要他閉嘴。事件發生當下的一段影片顯示，學生尖叫地質疑衛恩斯坦，他問學生：「你們到底要不要聽答覆？」學生大喊：「不要！」這個事件充分顯示，愈來愈狂熱到要羞辱不同觀點的人認為另一派是惡魔的化身，不應該讓他們有機會表達其想法。它可能孩子氣、太單純化，但是它也很危險，威脅到言論自由的理想。
美國人現在關閉思想有其來自左右兩方政治光譜的因素，這也壓縮了中間立場的空間。最惡劣的破壞者是那些積極尋求促使對另一派加深猜疑和仇恨的人。在這一頭極端，包括白人和黑人的分裂團體都有，某些團體持有武器；示威活動經常引發暴力。譬如，二○一七年在夏綠蒂維爾市（Charlottesville）為了反對拆除南北內戰時南方邦聯司令官羅伯．李（Robert E. Lee）將軍的塑像而爆發抗議；白人至上主義團體也介入，納粹旗幟、種族主義和反猶太人口號全部出籠。旋即發生暴力對抗，造成反示威的人士海瑟．賀耶（Heather Heyer）被一個白人至上主義者開車撞死。由於川普的反應，讓接下來的怒火更熾烈：他一再拒絕譴責這些極右派，包括3K黨和新納粹主義者，硬是聲稱雙方都有暴力行為。
跨越分界，不遠處就有黑人分裂團體；他們或許是反映白人的歧視才出現，但毫無疑問，它們的意識形態是種族歧視。典型的例子就是「伊斯蘭民族組織」（Nation of Islam），它的領導人路易斯．法拉汗（Louis Farrkhan）相信，六千六百年前有個黑人科學家雅庫布（Yacub），創造白人做為「藍眼珠的惡魔」，就是天生的邪惡和不敬神的代表。法拉汗也說，猶太人信的是「臭水溝宗教」（gutter religion），欺負黑人；他對黑人面臨的問題提出的解決辦法是，支持種族分離主義，以及終止種族通婚。
美國所有偉大的演講當中最著名的當屬亞伯拉罕．林肯（Abraham Lincoln）的〈分裂的家〉（A House Divided），這是他在一八五八年接受共和黨提名競選聯邦參議員時發表的演說。這句話出自聖經，出現在〈馬可福音〉第三章第二十五節、〈路加福音〉第十一章第十七節和〈馬太福音〉第十二章第二十五節。耶穌說：「若一家自相分爭，那家就站立不住。」林肯指的是美國因奴隸存廢問題分裂，現在美國發現自身再度深陷分裂：為了種族、族裔和政治傾向的分裂，全都造成緊張和情感激動。
美國這個愈來愈分裂的家，需要更理性、寬容和開放的心態去處理分歧，但是辯論——不論是右派或左派——卻往往在歇斯底里之下進行，狂熱地執意採用認同政治淹沒對方。在這種熾熱的氣氛中，川普關於邊境圍牆的言論刻意利用國家內部歷史的和新的分歧，掀起對「美國」的狹隘定義。種族、族裔和政治的分歧都歸結到這個問題上——美國是什麼，它應該是什麼，以及它如何發揚自己的自由和平等理想。
歐巴馬絕不是美國歷任總統中最成功的一位，他和其他所有總統一樣，也曾主張分裂性質的政策，但支撐他對美國的觀點的是一種信念：當國家擁抱「合眾為一」理念時，它會更強大，也會是更好的地方。他已淡入歷史，但他已在歷史上占有一席之地，他是現代美國能夠達致的榜樣。他在二○○四年民主黨全國代表大會上發表的演說就是例證：
評論家喜歡把我們的國家畫分成紅色州代表共和黨、藍色州代表民主黨……但我要告訴他們一個消息……我們在藍色州敬拜一位可敬的上帝，我們也不喜歡聯邦特務在紅色州的圖書館裡四處搜尋。我們在藍色州指導少棒聯盟打球，是的，我們在紅色州也有同性戀朋友……我們是一個民族。

外交事務權威專家提姆．馬歇爾繼《用十張地圖看懂全球政經局勢》之後又一力作。
本書從邊界高牆探討全球幾個重要地區內部的分歧，並概述其地理、歷史、政治、宗教和其他潛在因素，以及這些因素如何發揮作用，牆又如何阻隔和禁錮彼此的關係。牆透露了許多國際政治的現況，這些地區包括：美國／墨西哥、印度／巴基斯坦／孟加拉國、以色列／加薩，以及中國、中東、非洲、歐洲內部的不穩定關係。
這個世界遠比過去更加分歧。儘管我們身處全球化和科技日新月異之中，卻更比任何時候感受到分裂。二十一世紀至少有65個國家沿著邊境興建圍牆，數千英里長的高牆和圍籬重新定義了世界局勢。二戰後興造的圍牆，有一半是在2000年之後建造的。再過幾年，歐洲國家在其邊界所興建的高牆、圍籬和屏障，其長度將超過冷戰的巔峰時期。
興建高牆的理由來自財富、種族、宗教和政治等分歧。過去十年歐洲的分歧不僅威脅到歐洲的統一，甚至在某些國家威脅其自由民主政體。中國共產黨要防堵資本主義造成內部的分歧，這將界定其國家的未來。美國主張在墨西哥邊境興建圍牆，是因為擔心非法移民讓美國不再是白人占多數的國家。
金融危機、恐怖主義、暴力衝突、難民和移民、貧富懸殊擴大等威脅，讓人們擁抱群體、區分人我，在內心築起高牆。今天我們所面臨的問題是：現代的族群以什麼形式存在？人們是以階級、種族、宗教或國籍來界定自己嗎？這些族群能在「我們與他們」這個概念猶存的世界中共存嗎？
了解過去和現在有哪些因素使我們分歧，便能了解目前世局的演變。本書詳述當今世界所面臨的地緣政治問題，作者提姆．馬歇爾的觀察涵括中國、美國、以巴衝突、中東、印度次大陸、非洲、歐洲和英國，對於影響我們未來的斷層線提出精闢的分析。

The Age of the Wall: Trump’s remarks about the border wall set off a narrow definition of the United States
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that the concept of ""difference"" is now being manipulated by both the left and right wingers; this kind of identity politics is exacerbating US differences. At this moment in American history, although united by the spirit of the founding of the country, many groups still tear each other, which can be seen from the growing differences in the political arena.



Text: Tim. Tim Marshall
The past US presidents have also strengthened the US-Mexico border defense, but Trump's wall is particularly divided, because it represents a special moment in American history. The political implication of building a high wall is not just to block Mexicans and prevent them from coming in. The border defines a country, and Trump's wall attempts to define what the United States is essentially and ideologically. To understand how it reflects and deepens historical differences, we need to examine other cracks that divide the country.
The most widespread disagreement among all US differences is racial disparity. The US population is approximately 324 million people. According to the CIA World Factbook, the 2010 Census will prevail, of which 72%. Four are white, 12 percent. Six are black, four percent. Eight are Asian, and less than one percent are American Indians and Alaska Natives. ""The population of two or more races"" accounts for two percent. 9. Only 0.5% of Hawaiian aborigines and other Pacific Islanders. Second, ""other"" is six percent. two. You must have noticed that there is no such thing as a growing Spanish-speaking person. This is because the US Census Bureau believes that the Hispanic origin refers to a person with Spanish/Spanish/or Latin origin who may ""attribute to Any race or ethnic group."" This complex and diverse group is the largest ethnic minority in the United States, accounting for approximately 17 percent of the nation's population.
This number will continue to grow in the 21st century. We have already seen that the proportion of whites with more than half of the population is fading in countries that are struggling to fully integrate, especially in the southern states. The population estimates vary in number, but most experts believe that more than half of whites will cease to exist within a few decades. Non-whites, including Hispanics, currently account for about 40% of the US population. It is predicted that this proportion will rise to 53% in 2050, while Spanish-speaking is 20%. About nine, so it will be the fastest growing ethnicity in the next 30 years. For those who think that this trend is worrying, building a high wall and possibly stopping the tide of immigration is the hope of curbing this demographic change, although in reality it cannot reverse much of the situation.
However, the anti-immigration arguments are often accompanied by support for the construction of high walls and creating greater tension among the American people. Immigrants are often labeled as negative, and Trump calls them ""bad guys"": ""When Mexico sends people out, they don't send the best people... they send people with many problems, they bring these problems Give us. They bring drugs and crimes. They are violent criminals. However, I guess some people are good people."" This type of speech has caused a sharp rise in discrimination against Latinos over the past decade. For example, in the Piyou Survey of 2016, it was found that 52% of Hispanic people claimed that they were unfairly treated because of their ethnic relationship; in the group of 18 to 29 years old, The number has climbed to 65%. Interestingly, the same numbers also occur in the same age group of blacks, but as far as the entire Hispanic population is concerned, the number of people who experience racial discrimination is much less than that of blacks.
There is no doubt that there has been considerable progress in racial equality. Every day, tens of millions of Americans of different skin colors happily coexist, socialize, share, work and play together. However, racial discrimination remains a major problem throughout the country.
Although the fast-growing Hispanic people are certainly discriminated against, the most obvious ethnic differences in the United States appear between whites and blacks. This problem stems from the slavery period and continues to this day. Its negative effects on people's lives are very clear: almost all indicators, born in the United States, are black, destined to be poorer, less educated, and less healthy than white people. Of course, this is not universal truth: wealthy blacks, middle-class and suburban families are likely to have more opportunities than poor white rural families. According to a study by the Brookings Institution, whether you are a white, black or Hispanic origin, if you are from a poor family, even if you have a college degree, your income for the rest of your life is lower than that of a wealthy family.
Having said that, this is almost a law. In the lottery of life, if you are a black person, the winning rate is not high. It is still clear to date that the historical and current racial discrimination and the surprising difference in ethnic groups are still a major factor. This may be the case at the beginning of life. Among the richest countries in the world, whites have a baby mortality rate of four thousandths. Eight, but blacks are as high as eleventh. Seven - about the equivalent of a medium-sized country like Mexico.
Health is not as good as people, wealth is not as good as people, and prospects are not as good as people. All of them cause education to be inferior to people. This is obvious as early as two years old. According to the statistics of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the US Department of Education, at the age of two, black boys and young children showed a lower proportion of skilled development skills. At the age of three to five, this gap has risen slightly in terms of reading ability; it is generally believed that the possible factors are: black families are relatively lacking in reading materials, parents have no time to read something for their children, and may be because of some non-white Characteristics, lack of interest in books. From the school system, we can see that the dropout rate or expulsion rate of African Americans is three times that of white students. In schools where more than half of the students are ethnic minorities, teachers are often less experienced and have lower salaries.
Behind these numbers is usually the daily life of low-income, single-parent families. Twenty-five percent of black parents said that their children live in unsafe neighborhoods, and only 7% of white parents say so. By the time we reach the age of graduation, we find that African Americans are twice as likely to drop out of secondary school as white students. One study pointed out that if the education rate of American white and black high school students is divided into two different countries, the former is equivalent to the United Kingdom and the latter is equivalent to Chile. At the university level, three or six percent. 2. The whites of the two complete the degree. On the contrary, the blacks only have 22 percent. Fives. With a college degree to enter the workplace, black people earn less. The proportion of black Americans in jail is also high: blacks account for 14% of the US population, but 38% of those in prison are black.
Thus, from the cradle to the grave, the United States is a violent country compared to Europe, but if it is black, it is a more dangerous place. The murder rate of the white population is two per 100,000 people. Five people died. The black Americans are nineteen. Four people, equivalent to many third worlds or developing countries. Statistics may vary, but according to CNN's survey, young black men are nearly three times more likely to be killed by police than white young men. It's no wonder that African Americans have a shorter life expectancy than whites. Four years old. As the number of black men who have not been armed in recent years has increased, these amazing numbers have caused turmoil and protests throughout the United States – for example, the Ferguson incident in 2014 – The rise of the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. Official and community responses have been closely reviewed after each incident, which has become an increasingly divisive issue.
The data highlighting these problems is easy to find, and it is quite difficult to explain the causes. It is clear that racial discrimination still exists in American society. It is impossible for us not to talk about the beginning of the cause - slavery. The slaves have been liberated, but the vast majority have been abandoned in extreme poverty and socially discriminated; in this case, it is difficult for them to reach equality with the mainstream people. How long is it fast? The slaves have been free for more than 150 years. Although there have been many advancements, especially in the past 50 years, it is surprising that there are still many shortcomings to be improved.

Of course, race is not the only difference in the United States. For example, when it comes to religion, the United States has a strong advantage. It is a secular country with a variety of folk religious beliefs and places of worship. The majority of American beliefs are Christianity, which is subdivided into many different Protestant sects and Catholics, but since the 1960s it has increased the many other beliefs of believers. About 80% of Americans agree that they are Christians, and Protestants are the most, accounting for about 46% of the national population. six. Followed by Catholics, accounting for 20%. Eight. Next is Judaism (one percent. nine), Mormonism (one percent. six), Muslims (0.9 percent), Buddhism (0.9 percent), Hinduism (percent ○. Seven), as well as many other small sects.
Has all this made the United States a melting pot? Only to a certain extent. Despite some glaring inconsistencies and hypocrisy, the ideal ""oneness for one"" spirit is maintained to a considerable extent. Even so, in this century, the spirit of integration and assimilation within a multi-ethnic society is challenged by multiculturalism. Ethnic and ethnic differences have entered many of the cracks in American society, and there has been an identity politics that has plagued the Republic. More and more Americans identify themselves based on their ethnicity, religion, and gender orientation, and thus become more polarized and split. Different ethnic groups are encouraged to maintain a clear sense of identity; this approach does not lead to acceptance of pluralism, but in some cases causes certain groups to be isolated from the rest of the society, and to a certain extent, they are increasingly being Discrimination.
We saw this phenomenon during the 2016 presidential election. Hu Mayun. Humayun Kahn, a US Muslim soldier who died in Iraq for the country, was awarded a medal. After Hu Mayun’s father voiced his voice against Trump’s political ban on Muslim immigration, Trump criticized the parents. The couples of Kizil and Ghzala Kahn are known as ""Venus parents"". The term can be traced back to the First World War. If American families have children and their husbands fight overseas, they will hang out the national flag of Blue Star. If the family is unfortunately killed, the Blue Star will be replaced by Venus.
If the parents are white Christians, Trump’s verbal sniper will not be so intense. In American politics, because family members die for the country, it is usually impossible for parents of Venus to criticize. Trump claims that he has created many jobs in the United States and has sacrificed a lot for the country. He sneered at Mrs. Hahn’s husband and did not allow her to speak, suggesting that this was their religious work. He did not care whether Mr. Hann had taken his son Hu Mayun to visit the Jefferson Memorial Hall and instilled in him a passage in the memorial hall - ""We believe that these truths are self-evident, that is, people are equal in life... The candidate's commentary outside the voice seems to be that this is not the same for Venus' parents and other Venus families. His claims are indeed shared by some Americans who define what is meant by Americans in a very narrow way. Republican Senator John. John McCain was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. When he criticized Trump, he spoke out the voices of other Americans. Ma said: ""When our party nominated him, he did not attach his unconstrained permission to smear the elite among us.""
The concept of ""difference"" is now being manipulated by both the left and right wingers; this kind of identity politics is exacerbating US differences. At this moment in American history, although united by the spirit of the founding of the country, many groups still tear each other, which can be seen from the growing differences in the political arena.
In the first two years of Trump/Saunders/Clinton's 2006 melee, the Piyou Research Center conducted the largest ever survey of Americans' political attitudes. The survey found that people's opinions are becoming more and more persistent, and they are increasingly reluctant to accept the opinions of others. For example, 38% of Democrats who actively participate in politics consider themselves to be ""continuous liberals"", which is much higher than the 8% in 1994. At the same time, 33% of Republicans consider themselves to be ""consistent conservatives"", an increase from 23% twenty years ago. What is even more worrying is that more and more Republicans and Democrats despise each other, especially those who actively participate in politics. In 1994, 17% of Republicans had a ""very"" bad impression on Democrats, but now it has risen to 43%. On the contrary, Democrats have ""Republicans"". Very ""bad impression"" from 16 percent to 38 percent.
This phenomenon has its geographical factors. Strong Democratic voters are increasingly concentrated in large metropolitan cities, while Republicans are concentrated in small towns and rural areas. Professor Presdon, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Preston Stovall's article refers to ""urban globalist"" and ""non-urban nationalist"". He believes that these two terms more closely reflect the phenomenon of differentiation than ""Democrats"" and ""Republicans."" He sighs that non-urban ideas are ""deprecated to be stupid and ignorant,"" while urban ideas ""are considered to be elite thoughts, but morally degraded.""
I am surprised that urban Americans are so contemptuous of rural and agricultural communities. I don't remember when Americans were so arbitrarily defamed to the countryside, they were easily acquiesced or accepted... We must avoid treating Republican voters as uneducated racists, and Democratic voters are the tendency of elites.
It is important to note that most of these nouns and statistics involve active participation in politicians; outside the ideological fortress and back speakers, most people are more accepting of others’ opinions and have greater willingness to do so. Compromise compromise. Even so, the growing tendency to tolerate the opposite trend has led us to hear more and more violent remarks in the mainstream and to see more and more sharp remarks on the Internet. The quiet broadcast of the past three major TV network evening news bulletins has become a twenty-four-hour cable news channel for political fights, clamoring each other, and on unregulated networks, the threat of insulting opponents and taking life has become the norm. The rise of the 24-hour non-stop social media platform has also allowed extremists to have loudspeakers, and the general news media has strengthened the volume of this loudspeaker, giving the impression that Americans are constantly quarreling with each other. Killing (or tweeting every day), but in fact most Americans get along with each other. Now, some of the most intolerable people are younger generations. Many young people are quite disgusted with the ideals of freedom of speech now, and it is considered that this involves political intolerance of those who cannot agree with their opinions.
Extremism also appeared in the American education system, and a small group of students were promoted with the support of some professors. Most of the older generation of scholars performed more and more like rabbits that were illuminated by the headlights. The revolutionary children in turn opposed the predecessors who taught them such ideological paranoia. This has created a filthy academic atmosphere in the United States. The tough guys are aggressive in the bullying posture, and the weak intellectuals professors are defeated. These intruders pose a danger to cohesion because their activities are sharp and their speech and actions are magnified in online discussions. If more and more students are radicalized when they leave school, whether they are going to the left or to the right, there is a danger that extreme thoughts will become more and more popular.
One of the best cases appeared at Evergreen State College in Washington State in 2017. Liberal white professor Brett. Bret Weinstein opposes every vacancy in the school, and when hiring a new person, he needs to make a statement about the ethnic background. He also disagreed with a student group that asked the school to set a day when white students should not go to school in order to create a safe environment for people of color to speak freely. His classroom was immediately invaded by students, praising racial discrimination and white privilege. They asked to expel him and two other staff members. When the principal was George. When George Bridges tried to mediate, he was repeatedly cursed and asked to shut up. The current movie shows that the student screamed and questioned Weinstein. He asked the students: ""Do you want to listen to the answer?"" The student shouted: ""Don't!"" This event fully shows that it is getting more and more fanatical to be humiliated. People of different perspectives think that the other faction is the embodiment of the devil and should not give them a chance to express their ideas. It may be childish and too simplistic, but it is also dangerous and threatens the ideal of freedom of speech.
The fact that Americans are now closing their minds has its own political spectrum from both sides, which also compresses the space for intermediate positions. The worst destroyers are those who actively seek to promote deep suspicion and hatred against another faction. At this extreme, there are divided groups, including whites and blacks, and some groups hold weapons; demonstrations often trigger violence. For example, in the summer of Charlotte in the Charlottesville (Charlottesville), in order to oppose the dismantling of the Civil War, the Confederate commander Rob. The statue of General Robert E. Lee broke out in protest; the white supremacist group also intervened, and the Nazi flag, racism and anti-Jewish population were all out. Immediately, violent confrontation occurred, causing Hesser, the person who opposed the demonstration. Heather Heyer was killed by a white supremacist. Thanks to Trump's reaction, the next anger was even more violent: he repeatedly refused to condemn these extreme rightists, including the 3K Party and the neo-Nazs, and claimed that both sides were violent.
Crossing the border, there are black separatist groups not far away; they may appear to reflect white discrimination, but there is no doubt that their ideology is racial discrimination. A typical example is the Nation of Islam, its leader Louis. Louis Farrkhan believes that there was a black scientist, Yacub, 6600 years ago, who created whites as ""the demon of the blue eye,"" a representative of natural evil and disrespect. Farah Khan also said that the Jews believed in ""gutter religion"" and bullied black people; his solution to the problems faced by black people was to support racial separatism and to end racial intermarriage.
The most famous of all the great American speeches is Abraham. Abraham Lincoln's A House Divided, a speech he made when he accepted the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1858. This sentence comes from the Bible and appears in Mark 3:25, Luke 11:17 and Matthew 12:25. . Jesus said: ""If a family fights for itself, the family can't stand."" Lincoln refers to the splitting of the United States due to the abolition of slavery. Now the United States finds itself once again deeply divided: for the division of race, ethnicity, and political inclination. All cause tension and emotional excitement.
The increasingly fragmented home of the United States needs a more rational, tolerant and open mind to deal with differences, but the debate — whether it is the right or the left — is often carried out under hysteria, and is enthusiastic about using identity politics to drown each other. In this fiery atmosphere, Trump’s remarks on the border wall deliberately use the internal history of the country and new differences to set a narrow definition of the ""United States."" Racial, ethnic, and political differences are attributed to this question—what is the United States, what it should be, and how it carries forward its ideals of freedom and equality.
Obama is by no means the most successful president of the United States. Like all other presidents, he has advocated a split-type policy, but it is a belief that supports his view of the United States: when the country embraces ""the United States"" When it comes to ideas, it will be stronger and better. He has faded into history, but he has a place in history. He is an example that modern America can achieve. His speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 is an example:
Critics like to divide our national painting into the Red State on behalf of the Republican Party and the Blue State on behalf of the Democrats... but I want to tell them a message... We worship a respectable God in the Blue State, we don't like it either. Federal agents searched around the Red State library. We are playing in the Blue State Guild Little League, yes, we also have gay friends in Red State... We are a nation.

Foreign affairs authority expert Tim. Marshall continued his efforts after ""using ten maps to understand the global political and economic situation.""
This book explores the differences within several important regions of the world from the high walls of the border and outlines its geography, history, politics, religion, and other underlying factors, and how these factors work, and how the walls block and impede each other's relationships. The wall reveals the current state of international politics, including: the United States/Mexico, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Israel/Gaza, and unstable relations within China, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
This world is far more divided than in the past. Although we are in the midst of globalization and technology, we feel more divided than ever. At least 65 countries in the 21st century built fences along the border, and thousands of miles of high walls and fences redefine the world. Half of the walls built after World War II were built after 2000. In a few years, the heights, fences and barriers that European countries have built on their borders will exceed the peak of the Cold War.
The reasons for the construction of the high walls come from differences in wealth, race, religion and politics. The differences in Europe over the past decade have not only threatened the unification of Europe, but even threatened its liberal democracy in some countries. The Chinese Communist Party wants to prevent capitalism from causing internal differences, which will define the future of its country. The United States advocates the construction of a wall on the Mexican border because of fears that illegal immigration would make the United States no longer a white-majority country.
The threats of financial crisis, terrorism, violent conflicts, refugees and immigrants, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor have made people embrace groups, distinguish people and build high walls in the heart. The question we face today is: What form does the modern ethnic group exist in? Do people define themselves by class, race, religion or nationality? Can these ethnic groups coexist in the world where the concept of ""we and them"" still exists?
Knowing the past and present factors that make us different, we can understand the evolution of the current world. This book details the geopolitical issues facing the world today, author Tim. Marshall's observations include China, the United States, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Europe and the United Kingdom, providing an incisive analysis of the fault lines that affect our future.
