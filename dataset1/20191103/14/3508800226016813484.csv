你了解宇宙中的天體嗎？
宇宙中有無數個形狀、大小、特徵都不一樣的天體。我們利用地球上的巨大望遠鏡、太空望遠鏡，以及直接登陸天體的探測器，逐漸揭開這些天體的神祕面紗。在開始探索這浩瀚宇宙之前，先介紹一下出現在本書中的主要天體面貌吧！


恆星：因內部的氣體進行「核融合」反應而自行發光的天體。在夜空中閃閃發亮的星星絕大多數是恆星，而太陽則是離我們最近的。（相片＝太陽）Photo Credit: 西北國際



行星：在恆星的周圍繞轉，比恆星小的天體。由岩石、氣體或冰構成，反射恆星的光而發亮。太陽系中，包括地球在內一共有8顆行星。（相片＝木星）Photo Credit: 西北國際



衛星：在行星、矮行星、小行星周圍繞轉的天體。月球是地球唯一的衛星。（相片＝木衛二歐羅巴）Photo Credit: 西北國際



小行星：絕大多數是長度在數公尺至數十公里的小天體。太陽系中的小行星主要分布於火星及木星的軌道之間，數量非常龐大。也有一些小行星十分接近地球。（相片＝小行星灶神星）Photo Credit: 西北國際



矮行星：在太陽系中，除了太陽和行星之外，自身重量（質量）足以成為球體，但比行星小的天體。這個名稱來自於國際天文學聯合會2006年對太陽系天體所做的新分類。（相片＝冥王星）太陽系外緣天體：分布於海王星軌道附近至相當遙遠的外側、環繞太陽公轉的天體。冥王星也名列其中。Photo Credit: 西北國際



彗星：由冰和泥構成的彗核在接近太陽時會蒸發而形成尾巴。有些擁有扁平的橢圓軌道，會週期性出現；有些則沒有週期性。（相片＝楚留莫夫－格拉希門克彗星的核）Photo Credit: 西北國際

你了解宇宙中的天體嗎？
超新星：重量（質量）為太陽8倍以上的恆星在結束一生時所發生的大爆炸。被稱為超新星，是因為爆炸時就好像天空中有一個點突然發出強烈的亮光，看起來好像一顆新的星球誕生。
超新星殘骸：恆星發生超新星爆炸後，原本屬於該恆星的氣體以高速飛散開來所形成的天體。它在逐漸擴散期間會不斷地改變形貌，最後氣體全部逸散到宇宙中。
行星狀星雲：重量與太陽差不多的恆星最後的身影。在結束一生時大幅膨脹而成為紅超巨星，然後星球的氣體緩慢地往外流逝，逐漸逸散到宇宙中。

中子星：重量為太陽8〜30倍的恆星發生超新星爆炸後，所殘留的非常重的天體，一顆方糖大小的中子星，重量便可達10 億公噸。它會週期性地放出強烈電波，因此也被稱為脈衝星。
黑洞：重量超過太陽30倍的恆星發生超新星爆炸後，殘留下來的非常重的天體。由於它的重力極端強大，就連光也無法脫離，所以很難觀測到。恆星的黑洞有些是單獨存在，有些則和其他天體組成雙星或多重星。

星系中心的巨大黑洞：現在我們已逐漸明白，許多星系的中心擁有超級巨大的黑洞，重量高達太陽的數百萬至數十億倍。科學家們已觀測到：被黑洞吸過來氣體等物質，在黑洞的周圍構成了巨大的圓盤，並從圓盤上下兩端放出X射線等電磁波的景象。

你了解宇宙中的天體嗎？
疏散星團：在星雲裡，同時期誕生的數十至數百顆恆星所組成的年輕恆星集團。由於周圍的氣體反射而散發出美麗的光輝。這些恆星不久後可能也會逐漸遠離分散。
球狀星團：由數萬至數百萬顆恆星集結而成的球體狀星團，直徑廣達100~300光年，其中大部分是老年恆星。我們的銀河系中，已發現的球狀星團大約有150個。
星系的分類：星系是由數千億顆恆星和氣體等物質及大量看不見的物質所組成的大集團。星系的種類如下圖所示，分為5種。估計全宇宙這樣的星系大約有兩兆個。星系可分為橢圓星系、透鏡形星系、螺旋星系、棒旋星系及不規則星系等5種。

螺旋星系：群星閃耀且擁有螺旋狀旋臂的部分稱為「星系圓盤」，中央鼓脹起來的區域稱為「核球」。絕大多數星系的核球裡頭有個巨大的黑洞。宇宙中的星系將近80％擁有螺旋哦！
不規則星系：呈不規則狀、無法納入其他4種類型的星系。規模較其他4種星系小。擁有大量的氣體和微塵，並且產生出為數可觀的恆星。
類星體：距離地球非常遙遠的星系的一種。和一般星系不同，它會從中心部分射出具有龐大能量的噴流。中心可能有個巨大的黑洞。

Encyclopedia of the Universe Exploration: a neutron star of the size of a sugar cube, weighing up to 1 billion metric tons
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that there are countless celestial bodies in the universe with different shapes, sizes, and features. We use the huge telescopes on Earth, space telescopes, and detectors that directly land on celestial bodies to gradually reveal the mystery of these celestial bodies.

Do you understand the celestial bodies in the universe?
There are countless celestial bodies in the universe with different shapes, sizes and features. We use the huge telescopes on Earth, space telescopes, and detectors that directly land on celestial bodies to gradually reveal the mystery of these celestial bodies. Before you start exploring this vast universe, let's introduce the main celestial features that appear in this book!


Stellar: A celestial body that emits light by itself due to the ""nuclear fusion"" reaction of the internal gas. Most of the stars shining in the night sky are stars, and the sun is closest to us. (Photo = Sun) Photo Credit: Northwest International



Planet: A celestial body that rotates around the star's circumference and is smaller than the star. It consists of rock, gas, or ice that reflects the star's light and illuminates. There are eight planets in the solar system, including the Earth. (Photo = Jupiter) Photo Credit: Northwest International



Satellite: A celestial body that revolves around planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids. The moon is the only satellite of the earth. (Photo = Europa Europa) Photo Credit: Northwest International



Asteroids: The vast majority are small objects ranging in length from a few meters to tens of kilometers. The asteroids in the solar system are mainly distributed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and the number is very large. There are also some asteroids that are very close to the Earth.

Dwarf planet: In the solar system, in addition to the sun and the planet, its weight (mass) is enough to be a sphere, but a small object smaller than the planet. The name comes from the new classification of solar system celestial bodies by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. (Photo = Pluto) Solar system outer celestial body: a celestial body that is distributed around the orbit of Neptune to a fairly distant outer side and revolves around the sun. Pluto is also among them. Photo Credit: Northwest International



Comet: A nucleus composed of ice and mud evaporates as it approaches the sun to form a tail. Some have flat elliptical orbits that appear periodically; others have no periodicity. (Photo = Chulumov - Gracimenke's nuclear) Photo Credit: Northwest International

Do you understand the celestial bodies in the universe?
Supernova: The big explosion that occurs when the star whose weight (mass) is more than 8 times the sun ends in life. It is called a supernova because it is like a point in the sky that suddenly gives off a strong light when it explodes. It looks like a new planet is born.
Supernova Remnant: A celestial body formed by the gas that originally belonged to the star after the supernova explosion. It gradually changes its shape during the gradual diffusion, and finally the gas escapes into the universe.
Planetary Nebula: The last figure of a star with a weight similar to the Sun. At the end of his life, he expanded into a red superstar, and then the gas of the planet slowly passed out and gradually dispersed into the universe.

Neutron Star: A star that is 8 to 30 times the weight of the Sun. After the supernova explosion, the very heavy celestial body, a sugar cube-sized neutron star, can weigh 1 billion metric tons. It periodically emits strong electric waves and is therefore also known as a pulsar.
Black Hole: A very heavy celestial body that remains after a supernova explosion in a star that weighs 30 times more than the sun. Because its gravity is extremely strong, even light can't be separated, so it is difficult to observe. Some of the black holes of the stars exist alone, while others form binary or multiple stars with other celestial bodies.

The huge black hole in the center of the galaxy: Now we have come to understand that the centers of many galaxies have super huge black holes that weigh in the millions to billions of times the sun. Scientists have observed that a substance such as a gas is sucked into a black hole, and a huge disk is formed around the black hole, and electromagnetic waves such as X-rays are emitted from the upper and lower ends of the disk.

Do you understand the celestial bodies in the universe?
Open Star Cluster: A young star group consisting of dozens to hundreds of stars born in the same period in the nebula. Beautiful radiance due to the reflection of the surrounding gas. These stars may also gradually move away from dispersion in the near future.
Globular cluster: A globular cluster of tens of thousands to millions of stars, ranging in diameter from 100 to 300 light years, most of which are older stars. In our Milky Way, there are about 150 globular clusters.
Classification of galaxies: Galaxies are large groups of hundreds of billions of stars and gases and a large number of invisible substances. The types of galaxies are shown in the following figure and are divided into five types. It is estimated that there are about two trillion galaxies in the universe. Galaxies can be divided into elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies, spiral galaxies, barred spirals, and irregular galaxies.

Spiral galaxy: The part of the star that shines and has a spiral arm is called the ""galaxy disc"", and the area that bulges in the center is called the ""nuclear ball."" Most galaxies have a huge black hole in their nucleus. Nearly 80% of the galaxies in the universe have spirals!
Irregular galaxies: Irregular, unable to be included in the other four types of galaxies. The scale is smaller than the other four galaxies. It has a lot of gas and dust, and it produces a lot of stars.
Quasar: A type of galaxies that are very distant from the Earth. Unlike a normal galaxy, it emits a jet of massive energy from the center. The center may have a huge black hole.
