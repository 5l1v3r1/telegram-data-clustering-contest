《泰國》：蒲美蓬國王依舊不相信，中國對泰國沒有地緣政治企圖
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是自一九五○年代晚期以來，「捍衛民主」的第二要務雖然跟排行首位的捍衛君王有一大段距離，卻在一九九二年五月開始展現其政治效力。示威群眾大多數真誠支持民主，於是泰國史上第一次也是僅有的一次，多數人民拒絕接受實質或事實上的軍事統治，「泰國之春」終於綻放。



文：班傑明・札瓦基（Benjamin Zawacki）
泰國之春
川的積極外交政策植基於國內的政治發展。在炳與塔克辛之間的十二年，泰國有六人共任八屆總理，第一位被一九九一年二月的政變推翻。政變領袖蘇欽達・甲巴允（Suchinda Kraprayoon）將軍公開提及恰差的貪腐，引述沙立的主張，即「民主」需要為泰國人特別重新校準。兩週內，他強行通過當時泰國史上最大宗的軍武購買案，並且讓阿南就任總理。一年後，此項違反直覺、動用軍事手段達成平民領導的路徑反轉，蘇欽達在下一輪選舉後親自掌權。一九九二年五月四日，有八萬人民走上街頭抗議，五月十七日則來到二十萬人。「獲得總理蘇欽達知悉與同意」，「摧毀敵人」的命令下達。一九六○年代晚期將泰國軍隊調度至越南的兩位退役軍人跳了出來。已退役的少將詹龍・斯里滿仍然參與少壯派的謀略，在泰國的軍隊與民主間發展出一種相互懷疑關係。
自一九五○年代晚期以來，「捍衛民主」的第二要務雖然跟排行首位的捍衛君王有一大段距離，卻在一九九二年五月開始展現其政治效力。示威群眾大多數真誠支持民主，站在他們另一邊的是將軍素拉育・朱拉暖（Surayud Chulanont），他指揮的士兵殺害至少一百人，另有數百人受傷。至少兩百位抗議人士失蹤。前總理炳跟美國大使館開會時，「佯裝對局勢不知情，並且鮮少透露現況」。然而數小時後他促成一通電話，讓詹龍與蘇欽達一同向王室報告，通話後蘇欽達辭職並離開泰國。
於是泰國史上第一次也是僅有的一次，多數人民拒絕接受實質或事實上的軍事統治，「泰國之春」終於綻放。此時期將維持五年，同時是川的第一次總理任期，且於通往泰國最進步的體制時達到頂點。詹龍藉此以他未能預料且絕對不希望的方式成功——異議人士主張的因果報應。由於泰王站在示威群眾這一邊，而非兩股軍事派系，網絡君主制遭到削弱。無論多麼短暫，取而代之的是較民主的王室網絡，即川的民主黨與人民。泰國人將憤怒轉為行動主義，並且催生了現代泰國公民社會：「媒體慶賀身處亞洲最自由活躍的環境……經濟規劃從成長導向修正為社會目標。教育與醫療衛生改革由私人倡議團體規劃，並且迫使不情願的官僚接受。」對抗環境惡化的窮人議會成效最卓著。
王室主導
在一九九一年政變後，王室藉由王后詩麗吉（Sirikit）和公主詩琳通的出訪立即安撫美國，她們受到美國總統老布希夫婦的接待。從童年過後未曾赴美，公主在劍橋為蒲美蓬・阿杜德國王廣場的紀念匾牌剪綵。一九九四年公主朱拉蓬的先生獲任為駐華府武官，不僅提醒泰國的軍隊——君王連結，還包括與美國的連結。即使在金融危機過後，公主詩琳通於一九九八年參訪甘迺迪太空中心（Kennedy Space Center）象徵著國王對於美國的不變承諾。
儘管國王的出身、經驗與傾向皆為國際主義派，他謹記全球化當中美國的不對等角色，並且審慎提防在一九八○年代全面受其支配。蒲美蓬國王的一些鄉間開發計畫不僅跟新的草根網絡與非政府組織相輔相成，並且使進步潮流更能本土化。但是一九九七年的騷亂並未造成與美國利益間的意識型態衝突，僅僅確認了國王厭惡全球市場天生的風險與貪婪。他同意美國觀點，主張王國的財政與經濟政策必須「簡樸」與永續。
泰王也依舊不相信中國對於泰國並無地緣政治圖謀。詩琳通公主是天安門事件後首位出訪北京的王室成員，到此時她赴中國（有時每月造訪）已成慣例達十年。二○○○年她將獲頒中國最早的語言、文化暨友誼勳章。縱使王后詩麗吉遲至二○○○年才出訪，此舉僅僅符合中國開始呈現的更高調姿態。與美國之間唯一的區域歧見來自緬甸。假定他們必須「向大使館報告一切事項」，泰王於一九九四年告知喬治城大學（Georgetown University）代表，美國經濟制裁將導致邊界上的煩擾。
人權
一九九一至一九九二年的事件並未遏止違反人權，而是開啟了另一扇更寬廣的門，使違權行為曝光並加以處理；一九九四年泰國發生九百八十八次公眾抗議，比四年前的一百七十次高出許多。然而，總理阿南對於涉及一九九二年五月暴力行為的所有人發布特赦，拒絕究責與賠償。這包括日後策動二○○六年政變的頌提・汶雅叻格林（Sonthi Boonyaratglin），以及將於政變後當上總理的素拉育將軍。曾於前一年哀嘆「軍方可能要再過五十年才會接受在泰國的適當角色」的阿南，自身亦協助實現此預言。二○○○年國防部終於發布關於鎮壓的（非獨立）報告，內容完全不承擔維安部隊的責任或違法行為。
一九九四年美國抗議一位美國人在受羈押時死亡，宣告「不受懲罰的氛圍是不利於警察行為產生任何顯著改變的單一最大因素」。警方承認施虐，僅僅在一九九五年就殺害三百五十九位嫌疑人。強迫遣返難民在此十年間依舊盛行，移民拘留中心的處理條件已構成虐待。泰國當局選在一九九五年十二月的西方假日期間，將尋求政治庇護的苗人強迫遣返寮國，此做法將於二○○○年代反覆上演數次。欠缺正式的公民身分，近九十萬泰國「山地族」（hill-tribe）面臨移動、工作、教育與健康方面的嚴苛限制。一九九六年，約八十位警察阻止兩位國際特赦組織代表將中國的人權檔案遞交給中國駐曼谷大使館。他們也在一九九七年六十度對媒體和學術出版刊物發出無合理原因的警告，不過反共人士法終於在隔年廢除。
正面與負面觀點交疊下，一九九七年憲法成為泰國之春最具代表性的單一要素。起草涵蓋廣泛以確保草根可信度與真正進步，卻遭受保守利益抵抗，使許多改革與發聲受限。眾多權利（關於性別、資訊、犯罪嫌疑人、地方社群、環境）編入憲法，專門處理選舉、貪腐、人權、媒體和治理的新委員會與法庭成立。然而資格與標準條件使進步因素處於劣勢，軍隊則未能將反抗政變的權利納入憲法。
據川的外交部長所述：「因此毫不意外地，民主找到方法涉入我們的外交政策。」在川第二次卸職前，泰國簽署或批准了聯合國的條約，關於兒童、公民與政治權、施虐、經濟與文化權，以及新成立的國際刑事法院（International Criminal Court）。這也讓聯合國難民署（UN Refugee Agency）終於得以正式前往「臨時庇護所」，當時多半收容來自緬甸的難民。
置身前百分之十
泰國的華人血統公民仍占至少百分之十的人口，他們在自身協助形塑的「金錢政治」方面大有進展，且將觸角伸入公職與極其重要的軍方。在本質上，泰華在泰國取得顯赫地位與權力，正如同中國在外部世界的進展。在社會上，lookjin（泰華）或甚至原先視為貶語的jek身分成為一時風尚。恰差是泰中友好協會的主席。一九九○年，富有且人脈廣布的卜蜂集團協助差瓦立將軍組成新政黨。三年後他成立「泰中文化經濟協會」（Thai Chinese Cultural and Economic Association）。當他在金融危機期間猛烈批評「前來定居在這片土地上的那些他者……毀了這片土地」，政治傷害遠遠超越了諷刺意味。他的繼任者川驕傲地聲明：「我的祖先是華人，族群使我們的國家與人民間存在一種特殊情感。」而行事果斷的泰國華人塔克辛，則是利用金融危機作競選的起點。
泰華企業尤其受到金融危機的深深打擊，證實了他們在稍早十年間的成長與野心（以及過度宣傳）；當時卜蜂集團是唯一在所有中國省分皆有投資的外國企業。這是中國急遽與長久經濟成長的「第一層樓」。林明達是泰華商業富豪，他的財富在一九九○年代大起大落。他主張與中國華人同胞的「關係」是他起初成功的關鍵，比美國人的合約更可靠、油水更多。誠然，在一九九四年東南亞的億萬富翁裡，百分之八十六擁有華人血統，形成「無國界的華人海外網絡」，據傳其經濟規模排行世界第三。
一九九九年中國共產黨中央委員會總書記江澤民來訪受到泰華社群盛大歡迎，卻「激起溫和的辯論，起因是有些人認為他造訪曼谷中國城是在公然討好華人同胞」。與此同時，華人社群支持川拒絕江澤民禁止法輪功信眾在曼谷集會的請求。法輪功自一九九○年代中期起活躍於泰國，在卜蜂集團總部的食堂練功。卜蜂的一位資深經理也是信徒，他在一九九六年接待法輪功的中國創辦人來曼谷；兩年後中國開始推動禁止練功，借用食堂的情形就此中止。

親中？親美？看泰國如何在中美間夾縫求生！在外交上施行「對沖政策」的泰國，可以給予台灣什麼啟示？原本是美國堅實盟友的泰國，是如何因為美國錯估形勢、中國強勢崛起，而成為中美兩強縱橫的角力場？泰國又如何抓準時機，謀取最大利益？

自第二次世界大戰以來，泰國曾經將自己定位為美國的重要戰略盟友，在越戰時泰國是美國在東南亞反共的堡壘，以及美軍的基地。同時美國也提供數百萬元的軍事和經濟援助，做為回報。然而，作者觀察到近幾十年來泰國的對外關係出現了驚人的逆轉，曾經是死敵的中國，如今被泰國軍政府視為有價值的盟友。這項轉變反映了中國一步步增加在東南亞的影響力，也同時是美國在亞洲的重大挫折。
在本書中，作者班傑明・札瓦基考察泰國自一九四五年到二○一四年的政治發展，以堅實的歷史分析，大量的文獻紀錄和深度訪談，剖析原本是美國堅實盟友的泰國，為何會向中國投懷送抱。泰國與東南亞各國又如何在美國宣布「重返亞太」時，成為中美雙方的角力場、全球事務的戰場。這場外交戰爭虛掩在泰國內政的派系鬥爭、選舉角力、軍事政變、經濟發展與財閥崛起的錯縱脈絡間，兩頭牽拉的是崛起中國強化地緣安全的需求，以及冷戰後美國對於亞洲發展的政治短視與錯估形勢。
作者在本書最後總結，泰國往中國的偏移，對於整個東南亞區域未來發展方向是重要指標，因為每個國家都將面臨與泰國類似的區域經濟與地緣政治的抉擇，到底該親中還是親美，要如何才能求取國家的最大利益。

""Thailand"": Pu Meipeng still does not believe that China has no geopolitical attempts against Thailand.
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that since the late 1950s, the second priority of ""defending democracy"" has shown a political distance since May 1992, although it has a long way to go before defending the king. . Most of the demonstrators sincerely supported democracy, so the first and only time in the history of Thailand, most people refused to accept substantive or de facto military rule, and the ""Thailand Spring"" finally bloomed.



Text: Benjamin Zawacki
Thai Spring
Sichuan’s active foreign policy is based on domestic political development. In the 12 years between Bing and Taksim, there were six people in Thailand who served as eight prime ministers. The first was overthrown by the coup in February 1991. Coup leader Suchinda Kraprayoon publicly mentioned the corruption of the right, citing Shari’s claim that ""democracy"" needs to be recalibrated for Thais. Within two weeks, he forced the passage of the largest military and military purchase in the history of Thailand and allowed Anan to become prime minister. A year later, this counterintuitive, using military means to achieve a reversal of the path of civilian leadership, Su Qinda personally took power after the next round of elections. On May 4, 1992, 80,000 people took to the streets to protest. On May 17, they came to 200,000 people. ""The Prime Minister Su Qinda knows and agrees"" and the order to ""destroy the enemy"" is issued. Two veterans who dispatched the Thai army to Vietnam in the late 1960s jumped out. The retired Major General Zhan Long Seriman is still involved in the strategy of the younger generation, developing a mutual skepticism between the Thai army and democracy.
Since the late 1950s, the second priority of ""defending democracy"" has shown a political distance since May 1992, although it has a long way to go before defending the king. Most of the demonstrators sincerely supported democracy. On the other side were the generals Surayud Chulanont, who commanded soldiers to kill at least 100 people and hundreds of others injured. At least two hundred protesters were missing. When the former Prime Minister Bing met with the US Embassy, he ""pretending to be ignorant of the situation and rarely revealing the current situation."" However, a few hours later he made a phone call and let Zhan Long and Su Qinda report to the royal family. After the call, Su Qinda resigned and left Thailand.
So the first and only time in the history of Thailand, most people refused to accept substantive or de facto military rule, and the ""Thailand Spring"" finally bloomed. This period will last for five years, and it is the first prime minister's term of Sichuan, and it will reach its peak when it comes to Thailand's most progressive system. Zhan Long succeeded in his unpredictable and absolutely undesired way – the karma of dissidents. Since the King of Thailand stood on the side of the demonstrators rather than the two military factions, the network monarchy was weakened. No matter how short it is, it is replaced by a more democratic royal network, namely the Democratic Party and the people of Sichuan. Thai people turned anger into activism and gave birth to modern Thai civil society: “The media celebrates the most free and active environment in Asia... The economic plan is revised from a growth orientation to a social goal. Education and health care reform is planned by private initiatives. And forced the reluctant bureaucrats to accept."" The poor parliament against the environmental degradation has achieved the most outstanding results.
Royal leadership
After the 1991 coup, the royal family immediately appease the United States through the visit of Queen Sirikit and Princess Sirindhorn, who were received by the President of the United States, the old Bushi. After she had never been to the United States since her childhood, the princess cut the ribbon for the commemorative plaque of Pumei Peng Adudou Square in Cambridge. In 1994, the princess of the princess, Zhu Lapeng, was appointed as the military attache in Washington, not only reminding the Thai army - the king of the link, but also the link with the United States. Even after the financial crisis, Princess Sirindhorn’s visit to the Kennedy Space Center in 1998 symbolized the King’s unchanging commitment to the United States.
Although the king's origins, experiences, and tendencies were internationalists, he remembered the unequal role of the United States in globalization and was cautiously wary of its full control in the 1980s. Some of the rural development plans of King Pumei Peng not only complemented the new grassroots network and NGOs, but also made the trend of progress more localized. But the riots of 1997 did not create an ideological conflict with US interests, only confirming that the king hated the natural risks and greed of the global market. He agreed with the US view that the kingdom's fiscal and economic policies must be ""simple"" and sustainable.
King Tae still does not believe that China has no geopolitical plot for Thailand. Princess Sirindhorn was the first member of the royal family to visit Beijing after the Tiananmen Square incident. At this time, she went to China (sometimes monthly visits) and has become a practice for ten years. In 2000, she will be awarded the earliest language, culture and friendship medal in China. Even though Queen Sirikit did not visit until 2000, the move was only in line with China’s higher profile. The only regional disagreement with the United States comes from Myanmar. Suppose they have to ""report everything to the embassy"". In 1994, Thai King told Georgetown University that US economic sanctions would cause annoyance on the border.
human rights
The events of 1991-1992 did not stop the violation of human rights. Instead, they opened another broader door to expose and deal with violations. In 1994, 980 occurred in Thailand. Eight public protests were much higher than the one hundred and seventy times four years ago. However, Prime Minister Anan issued amnesty to all those involved in the violence in May 1992 and refused to investigate and compensate. This includes Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who will instigate the coup in 2006, and General Surayud, who will become prime minister after the coup. In the previous year, he sighed that ""the military may have to accept the appropriate role in Thailand in another 50 years,"" and he also helped to achieve this prediction. In 2000, the Ministry of National Defense finally issued a (non-independent) report on repression, which did not assume any responsibility or illegality of the troops.
In 1994, the United States protested that an American died while in custody, proclaiming that ""the atmosphere of impunity is the single biggest factor that is not conducive to any significant change in police behavior."" The police admitted to the abuse, killing only 359 suspects in 1995 alone. Forced repatriation of refugees has continued to prevail during the decade and the conditions of treatment in immigration detention centres have constituted ill-treatment. The Thai authorities chose to force the repatriation of Miao people seeking political asylum to the country during the Western holidays in December 1995. This practice will be repeated several times in the 2000s. Lack of formal citizenship, nearly 900,000 Thai “hill-tribes” face severe restrictions on mobility, work, education and health. In 1996, about 80 police officers prevented two Amnesty International representatives from submitting Chinese human rights files to the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. They also issued warnings to the media and academic publications for no reasonable reason at 60 degrees in 1997, but the anti-communist law was finally abolished the following year.
The positive and negative views overlap, and the 1997 Constitution became the most representative single element of the Spring of Thailand. Drafting covers a wide range to ensure grassroots credibility and real progress, but suffers from conservative interests, limiting many reforms and voices. Numerous rights (on gender, information, suspects, local communities, the environment) are incorporated into the Constitution, and new committees and courts specializing in elections, corruption, human rights, media and governance are established. However, the qualifications and standard conditions put the progressive factors at a disadvantage, and the military failed to incorporate the right to resist the coup into the constitution.
According to Sichuan’s Foreign Minister: “Therefore, no surprise, democracy finds ways to involve our foreign policy.” Before the second resignation of Sichuan, Thailand signed or ratified the UN treaty on children, citizens and political rights. , sadism, economic and cultural rights, and the newly established International Criminal Court. This also allowed the UN Refugee Agency to officially travel to the Temporary Shelter, where most of the refugees from Myanmar were hosted.
Ten percent before being in the body
Thai Chinese descent citizens still account for at least 10% of the population. They have made great progress in helping themselves to shape the ""money politics"" and have extended their reach into public office and extremely important military. In essence, Taihua has achieved prominent status and power in Thailand, just as China's progress in the outside world. In the society, lookjin (Taihua) or even the jek identity that was originally regarded as a proverb became a fashion. It is the chairman of the Thailand-China Friendship Association. In 1990, the wealthy and well-connected CP Group assisted General Chavalit in forming a new political party. Three years later he established the ""Thai Chinese Cultural and Economic Association"". When he criticized the ""others who came to settle on this land... ruined the land"" during the financial crisis, political damage far exceeded the irony. His successor Chuan proudly stated: ""My ancestors were Chinese, and the ethnic group has a special feeling between our country and the people."" The decisive Thai Chinese Taksim is the starting point for the use of the financial crisis.
In particular, Taihua companies were deeply hit by the financial crisis, confirming their growth and ambitions (and over-promotion) in the early ten years; at that time, the CP Group was the only foreign company that invested in all Chinese provinces. This is the ""first floor"" of China's impetuous and long-term economic growth. Lin Mingda is a commercial wealthy man in Taihua. His wealth has been ups and downs in the 1990s. He advocated that the ""relationship"" with Chinese Chinese compatriots was the key to his initial success, and he was more reliable and more oily than the American contract. It is true that 86% of the billionaires in Southeast Asia in 1994 had Chinese ancestry and formed a “Chinese network without borders”, which is said to rank third in the world in terms of economic size.
Jiang Zemin, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1999, was greatly welcomed by the Taihua community, but ""provoked a moderate debate. Some people think that his visit to Bangkok Chinatown is openly welcoming Chinese compatriots."" At the same time, the Chinese community supported Sichuan’s request to refuse Jiang Zemin’s ban on Falun Gong’s congregation in Bangkok. Falun Gong has been active in Thailand since the mid-1990s and practiced in the cafeteria of the CPP Group headquarters. A senior manager of the bee was also a believer. He hosted the Chinese founder of Falun Gong in Bangkok in 1996. Two years later, China began to promote the prohibition of practicing, and the use of the canteen was suspended.

Pro? Pro-American? See how Thailand survives between China and the United States! What kind of revelation can Taiwan give to Taiwan that implements a ""hedging policy"" in diplomacy? Thailand, which was originally a solid ally of the United States, has become a cornerstone between China and the United States because of the United States’ miscalculation of the situation and China’s strong rise. How can Thailand seize the opportunity and seek the best interests?

Since the Second World War, Thailand has positioned itself as an important strategic ally of the United States. During the Vietnam War, Thailand was the bastion of the United States in Southeast Asia and the base of the US military. At the same time, the United States also provides millions of military and economic assistance in return. However, the author observes an amazing reversal of Thailand's foreign relations in recent decades. China, once a deadly enemy, is now regarded as a valuable ally by the Thai military government. This shift reflects China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia and is also a major setback for the United States in Asia.
In this book, author Benjamin Zawaki examines the political development of Thailand from 1945 to 2014. With a solid historical analysis, extensive literature records and in-depth interviews, it is a solid American ally. Thailand, why is it to send a hug to China? How did Thailand and Southeast Asian countries become the battlefield between China and the United States and the global affairs when they announced their ""return to the Asia-Pacific"" in the United States. This diplomatic war is looming over the misunderstandings of the factional struggles, electoral wrangles, military coups, economic development and the rise of the chaebol in Thailand’s internal affairs. The two are pulling the need to strengthen China’s geopolitical security and the development of the United States after the Cold War. Political short-sightedness and miscalculation of the situation.
At the end of the book, the author concludes that the shift of Thailand to China is an important indicator for the future development of the entire Southeast Asian region, because each country will face a similar regional economic and geopolitical choices with Thailand. How can we seek the best interests of the country?
