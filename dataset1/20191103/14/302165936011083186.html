      <p>HONG KONG, Nov 3 — A bloody knife fight in Hong Kong left six people wounded this evening, including a local pro-democracy politician who had his ear bitten off, capping another chaotic day of political unrest in the city.</p>
      <p>Flashmob rallies erupted inside multiple shopping centers across the international finance hub over the afternoon, sparking frequent clashes with riot police.</p>
      <p>The violence was less sustained than yesterday when police and protesters fought hours of cat and mouse battles after thousands took the streets for an unsanctioned march.</p>
      <p>But the day ended with a brutal fight taking place outside a shopping mall in Tai Koo Shing, a middle-class neighbourhood on the main island where protesters had gathered for much of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Live broadcasts showed Andrew Chiu, a local pro-democracy councillor, with much of one ear severed.</p>
      <p>A second man was unconscious in a growing pool of blood as bystanders desperately tried to stem wounds to his back.</p>
      <p>Another man in a grey T-shirt had been beaten bloody by the crowd who accused him of carrying out the attack and wounding multiple people.</p>
      <p>RTHK news, which filmed the brawl, reported that the attacker was a Mandarin speaker — the predominant language on the Chinese mainland — and had been arguing with his victims about politics before he pulled out a knife.</p>
      <p>He bit off Chiu’s ear when the councillor tried to tackle him after the assault. A knife could also be seen lying on the floor outside the mall where the fight took place.</p>
      <p>Police told AFP that six people in total were wounded — four men and two women — and that three were arrested, without giving further details.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been upended by the huge, often violent, pro-democracy protests which have battered the financial hub’s reputation for stability and helped plunge the city into recession.</p>
      <p>Police are firing ever increasing rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets against small groups of hardcore protesters who have embraced throwing petrol bombs as well as vandalising pro-China businesses.</p>
      <p>With the city desperately polarised, street fights have broken out on both sides of the ideological divide with growing frequency.</p>
      <p>Beijing supporters have attacked opponents throughout the summer, often in targeted assaults against prominent government critics and opposition politicians.</p>
      <p>Crowds of pro-democracy protesters have also routinely beaten their ideological oppoents, usually in spontaneous mob violence during rallies.</p>
      <p>Beijing has shown no willingness to meet demonstrators demands for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability — and activists show no sign of leaving the streets with 22 consecutive weekends of unrest.</p>
      <p>This summer’s first protests in which millions marched were sparked by a now-abandoned attempt to allow extraditions to the mainland.</p>
      <p>But as Beijing took a hardline the movement snowballed.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for those arrested and fully free elections. — AFP</p>
