        <b>The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/diablo-iv-officially-announced/">recently announced Diablo IV</a> is set to be an online exclusive, requiring a constant internet connection at all times, regardless of which game mode you choose to play.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-wont-have-an-offline-mode-all-versions-ar/1100-6471115/">A Blizzard representative confirmed to GameSpot</a> that every version of Diablo 4 will be online-only, regardless of whether you’re on PC, PlayStation 4, or Xbox One.</p>
      <p>That means that even if you want to tackle the entire game solo and never interact with any other players, you’ll still require a constant internet connection in order to play.</p>
      <p>It’s not currently known whether the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game will require PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold to play, or whether players will be able to get away with just having a stable internet connection.</p>
      <p>Diablo IV was officially announced during BlizzCon 2019. The announcement came accompanied by a gory cinematic, which you can watch below.</p>

      <p>If you don’t have time to watch it or if you simply don’t want to, here’s a plot run down: the cinematic shows several adventurers entering a temple with their sights set on treasure.</p>
      <p>However, instead of treasure, they each come across their various untimely ends – save for one, who it turns out was actually the mastermind behind the whole bloody scheme.</p>
      <p>The last adventurer then proceeds to summon the demon known Lilith, a female Diablo. Then, with his quest completed, the last adventurer departs this mortal coil.</p>
      <p>Diablo IV will release on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. There’s no set release date right now, but it’ll most likely come out in 2020.</p>
