《禮悟》：我願意用一億元證明蔡依林的清白，因為她的信用無價
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是我馬上約Jolin見面，她跟我保證絕對沒有，我相信她，因為她一直是一個誠實的女孩。於是我發出應該是台灣演藝圈第一張「價值一億元」的聲明：只要誰能提出蔡依林的私密照，我就提供新台幣1億元的費用。

勇於正面對決，「危機」會變「轉機」
「壓力」的逆襲：競賽的壓力真的很大！尤其是在輸的那一刻，總是要花上很久的時間才能再站起來。然而，這又是一個充滿比賽的世界，我們要怎麼樣才能擺脫競賽的「壓力」魔咒呢？
娛樂圈最弔詭的地方就是，可以因為一個事件，就讓辛苦經營多年的成果，毀於一旦。尤其是在「狗仔文化」進入台灣後，更是讓藝人與經紀人動輒得咎。只要一則捕風捉影的報導，就可以讓經紀人疲於奔命。
我一直知道，「逃避」解決不了問題，只要同理心地找到每件事情的洞見：了解對象（媒體、觀眾、合作客戶等等）真的要的是什麼？並且勇於面對它，就能將「危機」變成「轉機」。
十多年前陳冠希與女星的「親密照」網路外洩事件，是我的經紀人生涯裡，印象很深的一課。當時媒體不僅捕風捉影，所有曾經跟陳冠希傳過緋聞的女明星都中槍，甚至還有媒體加油添醋、繪聲繪影地說蔡依林也是其中之一，而且還即將公開她的私密照。
我壓力大到出現短暫的圓頂禿，我不想隨媒體起舞，但我知道我必須面對，而且要用最快的速度解決，才能降低謠言的傷害以及安撫眾多廣告客戶。我馬上約Jolin見面，她跟我保證絕對沒有，我相信她，因為她一直是一個誠實的女孩。於是我發出應該是台灣演藝圈第一張「價值一億元」的聲明：只要誰能提出蔡依林的私密照，我就提供新台幣一億元的費用。
那是一場一億元的逆襲！謝謝蘋果日報以罕見的頭版頭條新聞版面幫我們澄清，而且後來沒有人能領到那筆獎金，那些尋事生非的媒體也都瞬間閉嘴！我願意用一億元證明一位天后的清白，因為她的信用無價！很快地，蕭亞軒的經紀公司也跟進了這樣的作法，迅速平息了這場風波。
不要逃避，逃避不會讓問題消失，甚至會讓問題長出更大的影子。真正讓人恐懼的，經常也不是問題本身，而是那個虛張聲勢的巨大身影，而你只要願意勇敢地跟問題對決，就會發現那個影子根本不堪一擊！
而對決的方式，不一定得分出高下，也可以去思考，如何創造雙贏。
這是一件我其實考慮了很久才又重提的往事，因為牽涉其中的人，都是好人，也都是朋友。
那是當時同時發片的羅志祥和王力宏。在發行第一週的銷售排行榜分屬第一名跟第二名，於是索尼音樂開記者會對媒體發出聲明，說發行羅志祥專輯的唱片公司買榜。
身為羅志祥的經紀人，再加上當時唱片景氣一年不如一年，我不想打口水仗，於是我透過媒體提出邀約，請力宏的唱片公司跟小豬一起在西門町辦唱片簽名會，讓蕭條已久的音樂市場，可以在這兩位天王的攜手努力下共創佳績！結果因為門戶之見，很可惜沒能看到兩位天王攜手共創雙贏。
索尼音樂辦的記者會，力宏沒有現身，我覺得發出那個聲明一定不是他的意思，因為羅志祥跟王力宏都是很優秀的藝人，而我相信他們對音樂的夢想跟努力，也絕對不是只想贏過對方而已。
這是兩個很簡單的故事，它們簡單的原因都是因為我們沒有拖延，因為拖延只會讓問題更複雜，而我們真正要解決的問題，經常都比我們所想像的簡單。
這兩個故事裡的主人翁，都在事件結束後變得更好，不單單是因為他們最後戰勝了什麼，而是因為他們在過程中展現的勇敢和態度，為他們贏得了更多的欣賞和尊敬。更重要的是，有時贏的定義，不是拿到冠軍，而是你有勇氣，站在競技場中。
獻給你的禮悟：真正「贏」的定義，是有勇氣去面對壓力。輸贏都已經不是重點。一直執著在跟人一較高低後的結果，其實是在貶低自己。

""Lei Wu"": I am willing to prove the innocence of Jolin Tsai with 100 million yuan, because her credit is priceless
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that I will meet with Jolin right away. She promises me absolutely no, I believe her, because she has always been an honest girl. So I issued the statement that it should be the first ""value of 100 million yuan"" in Taiwan's entertainment industry: As long as anyone can propose a private photo of Jolin Tsai, I will provide NT$100 million.



Text: Jiang Chengyu, Li Xiaoguang
Courageously confrontation, ""crisis"" will turn ""turning""
Counterattack of ""stress"": The pressure of the competition is really great! Especially at the moment of losing, it always takes a long time to stand up again. However, this is another world full of competitions. How can we get rid of the ""pressure"" curse of the competition?
The most condolence of the entertainment circle is that, because of an incident, the results of many years of hard work will be destroyed. Especially after the ""paparazzi culture"" entered Taiwan, it was even more so that artists and brokers could succeed. As long as there is a report of catching the wind, the broker can be exhausted.
I have always known that ""escape"" can't solve the problem, as long as the empathy finds the insight of everything: what do you really want to know about the object (media, audience, cooperative customers, etc.)? And with the courage to face it, you can turn the ""crisis"" into a ""transfer.""
More than a decade ago, Edison Chen and the actress’s ""intimate photo"" network leaks were a very deep lesson in my agent career. At that time, the media not only captured the wind, but all the female stars who had passed the rumor with Edison Chen were shot, and even the media cheered and painted, saying that Jolin Tsai was one of them, and she was about to disclose her private photos.
I am so stressed that there is a short dome baldness. I don't want to dance with the media, but I know that I have to face it and solve it with the fastest speed to reduce the damage of rumors and comfort many advertisers. I immediately met Jolin, she promised me absolutely no, I believe her, because she has always been an honest girl. So I issued the statement that it should be the first ""value of 100 million yuan"" in Taiwan's entertainment industry: As long as anyone can propose a private photo of Jolin Tsai, I will provide NT$100 million.
That is a counter-attack of 100 million yuan! Thanks to Apple Daily for helping us to clarify with a rare front page headline newsletter, and no one can get the bonus later, and those media that are looking for things are also instantly shut up! I am willing to use 100 million yuan to prove the innocence of a day, because her credit is priceless! Soon, Xiao Yaxuan’s brokerage company followed this practice and quickly calmed the storm.
Don't escape, escape will not let the problem disappear, and even make the problem grow bigger. What is really frightening is often not the problem itself, but the huge figure of the bluff, and as long as you are willing to courageously confront the problem, you will find that the shadow is completely vulnerable!
The way of confrontation is not necessarily to score high, but also to think about how to create a win-win situation.
This is a past event that I actually considered for a long time before re-raising, because the people involved are good people and friends.
It was Luo Zhixiang and Wang Lihong who made the film at the same time. In the first week of the release of the sales charts ranked first and second, so Sony Music News reporters issued a statement to the media, said the release of Luo Zhixiang album record company to buy the list.
As a broker of Luo Zhixiang, and the record of the year was not as good as one year, I didn't want to slobber, so I made an invitation through the media, asking Leehom's record company to hold a record signing ceremony with the pig in Ximending. Let the long-lost music market, together with the efforts of these two kings, create success! As a result, because of the portal, it is a pity that I could not see the two kings joining hands to create a win-win situation.
At the Sony Music Office press conference, Leehom did not show up. I think that the statement must not be his intention, because Luo Zhixiang and Wang Lihong are very good artists, and I believe that their dreams and efforts on music are definitely not just Win over the other party.
These are two very simple stories. The reason for their simplicity is because we have no delays, because delays only make the problem more complicated, and the problems we really have to solve are often simpler than we think.
The masters of these two stories have become better after the event, not only because they finally defeated anything, but because they showed their courage and attitude in the process, which won them more appreciation and respect. More importantly, sometimes the definition of winning is not to win the championship, but to have the courage to stand in the arena.
Dedication to you: The definition of true ""win"" is the courage to face pressure. Winning or losing is no longer the focus. The result of always being obsessed with being high and low is actually belittle yourself.

2017.09.01 Fate suddenly launched a ""reverse attack"" on him, a drowning accident, accompanied by a 16-year partner, turned into a vegetative. The sudden change of life is like a 921 earthquake that has experienced a physical and mental, but at the same time it has also achieved the greatest quenching chain. For the first time in seclusion, for the first time, he decided to tell everyone his story--
The young man, confused with sexual orientation and even committed suicide many times, struggled to self in negation. With his enthusiasm for work and the perseverance he said, at the age of 28, he became a popular AE in Ogilvy & Mather. When he was 35, he became a super agent and successfully pushed Jolin Tsai, Luo Zhixiang and Yang Yulin to the throne. At the age of 40, he and his life loved to hold a gay wedding. When everyone thinks that his story will have a happy ending, he will see hell on the eve of his 48th birthday...
This book is the result of his repeated life and counterattacks. In the face of the unavoidable setbacks and separations of life, he told us that even if it is impossible to grasp the various adversities in life, how to ""see"" it is always under my control. When we are faced with fear, pressure, frustration, regret, loneliness, we resist and flee, but we do not know that they are gifts that come down from heaven, until we experience the acceptance, the heart is convinced, and then we become ""rites.""
I hope that everyone who has been attacked by fate and who is alone in the middle of the night can find the courage to move forward.
