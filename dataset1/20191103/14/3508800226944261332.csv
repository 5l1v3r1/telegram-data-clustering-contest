《麻醉醫師靈魂所在的地方》：每隔一陣子，我就會把這些死在我手裡的病人想過一遍
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是每隔一陣子，我就會把這些病人從頭到尾想過一遍。這些死在我手裡的病人，關於他們怎麼死的，發生了什麼事，我沒有一個忘記。

有時候會有人這樣形容，麻醉醫師的工作跟機師有點像。機師的工作是將旅客安全地送到下一個目的地，麻醉醫師則是將病人安全地護送到未來。
飛機的起飛、高空駕駛、降落，就跟麻醉誘導、術中維持、麻醉甦醒有異曲同工之妙。機師操作飛行器，各種電子螢幕告訴他各種資訊，讓機師判斷如何安全地將飛行器飛到另一個地方；麻醉醫師則是利用各種生理監測器，告訴我們病人目前的生理狀況，讓我們協助病人安全地度過手術帶來的破壞及疼痛。
當時我還是年輕的主治醫師，有一次帶住院醫師一起做心臟手術。當天的病人因為主動脈瓣嚴重逆流，預計接受主動脈瓣置換手術。主動脈瓣逆流手術在麻醉時，最易被疏忽的地方在於動脈導管所呈現的血壓不是那麼準確。
血壓分成收縮壓跟舒張壓，一般的病人我們比較在乎病人的收縮壓，因為收縮壓只要夠高，舒張壓都不會太低。舒張壓代表的是心臟冠狀動脈灌流的壓力，假如太低的話，心臟會因缺氧而導致心肌細胞受傷。
但是主動脈逆流的病人，動脈導管呈現的收縮壓會因為管路共振的關係，往往會高估病人的收縮壓，舒張壓則會降得非常低，導致心臟灌流不足。因為血壓測不準的關係，這樣的病人麻醉之後，動脈導管的血壓要維持得比平常看到的還要高，才能維持足夠的心臟灌流。
在台灣，一名麻醉醫師要同時麻醉4個病人，所以完成麻醉誘導之後，我交代了住院醫師該注意的事項之後，就離開去別的房間幫病人麻醉。等到我忙完其他病人，回去卻發現病人的收縮壓只剩90幾，這樣的血壓對一般的病人是足夠的，但是對主動脈逆流的病人來說，已經太低了。我趕快叫住院醫師提高病人的血壓，但是為時已晚。
血壓一路往下掉，我打了很多強心劑，怎麼樣都拉不起來。心臟灌流的壓力一旦不夠，心肌細胞會開始缺氧受傷，受傷的心臟更打不出血液，心臟會因而越來越脹。脹大的心臟，心室內的壓力會越來越高，反過來又壓迫心臟的血管，導致血液的灌流更差，一整個落入惡性循環，最後導致心臟衰竭。
因為血壓拉不起來，我們只好緊急走體外循環，在這種狀況下，要緊急走體外循環你知道有多難？主動脈導管穿刺、靜脈引流管置入、在第一時間夾住主動脈、同時剪開主動脈、找到冠狀動脈、灌入心肌保護液、讓心臟停止、同時降溫保護心臟，動作要非常俐落細膩，才有可能完成全部程序。手腳不夠快的話，病人的心臟會腫脹得更厲害，受傷更嚴重……。剛好執刀的手術醫師也是年輕的主治醫師，心臟在停止之前，我親眼看著那顆心臟脹得更大，又掙扎地跳了兩下。
手術結束後，心臟沒有再度跳動，我們放了主動脈氣球幫浦，希望能幫助病人的心臟跳動。一個星期之後，病人還是因為心臟衰竭而死亡。而我自己知道，病人的病情並沒有嚴重到會死亡，假如我沒有離開那個房間，去別的房間做麻醉誘導，或者我手腳夠快，提早10分鐘回去，說不定他就不會死。他大概少活了10年。假如你知道這位病人的病情沒有嚴重到致死，但是他卻沒能挺過來，往後的人生，我該怎麼面對自己？這件事情成為我內心深處的一個負擔與祕密。
隨著時間過去，我心底的祕密越來越多。每隔幾年，我就會失去一個病人。那時候我值大夜班，有一位病人因為腸阻塞來開刀，腸阻塞最可怕的地方，在於病人在麻醉前後可能會嘔吐。嘔吐物如果嗆入呼吸道，會併發吸入性肺炎，嚴重的話，甚至有可能會死亡。
為了保護病人的呼吸道，為這種病人麻醉的最安全做法，就是清醒插管，意思就是先幫病人放好氣管內管後，再讓病人睡著。但是清醒插管非常痛苦，我們很少這樣做，折衷的辦法是快速插管，讓病人睡著，在最短的時間內建立氣管內管，我決定採取後者。
當我打了麻醉藥，挑起病人喉頭那一瞬間，食道也被我打開。我只看到食道開口處湧出大量的液體，淹沒整個呼吸道，不管我怎麼抽吸都來不及。
手術到一半，病人的血氧就開始往下掉，這吸入性肺炎來得又快又急。手術結束後，病人併發急性肺水腫呼吸窘迫症候群，其實到這個地步時，我們都還是有機會可以救他，只要使用葉克膜，就還有機會。但是當時在整個花東地區2、300公里範圍內，只有2台葉克膜，而且剛好都在使用中。一個星期後，終於等到葉克膜，病人也剛好因為多重器官衰竭而死亡。
手術成功，但是病人最後卻死了，這結果實在是蠢到令人難以接受。其實我只要幫他清醒插管，或是我動作再快3秒，他可能就不會死。他大概少活了20年。
我們剛開始做活體肝臟移植的時候，也付出過慘痛的代價。那時候一台手術大概要做20個小時，病人失血幾萬毫升是常有的事。
那時候剛過午夜零時，手術已經快要結束，我已經疲憊異常。病人因為失血過多，心跳越來越快。當時我已經注意到，病人的心電圖Ｑ波跟Ｔ波間，距離越來越長。
ＱＴ波間距越來越長，最後會發生Ｒ波打在Ｔ波上（R on T），導致致命性的心律不整。這種心律不整，可能跟低血鎂有關。這種併發症少之又少，只有在書本上讀過，我從醫生涯以來，從來沒有親眼看過。而且真正要精確地測量ＱＴ波的長度，要做十二導程的心電圖，最後還要開根號，除以一個數字來做心跳速度矯正，開刀的時候要這樣做，實在不易，而且手術已經要結束了，也就也沒有放在心上。
沒想到就在手術結束的時候，竟然真的發生致命性心律不整。我們幫病人電擊，並施予心肺復甦術，大概只花了30秒，就把病人救回來了。但是一個星期後，病人仍然因為移植的肝臟太小、功能不佳而死亡。移植的肝臟功能不好，可能有很多原因，其實沒有人能確定真正的原因是什麼，但是多少也可能跟心律不整導致缺血壞死有關。我好像欠了這位病人一條人命，而我記得她有一個女兒。我去術前訪視的時候，見過她女兒。我欠她女兒一個完整的家，一個完整的人生。
我後來發現，我越欠越多。假如人生可以交換的話，我願意用餘生去換他們回來，把我欠的償還給他們。假如今生不夠還的話，那我就預支來世的壽命還給他們。假如還不夠的話，就再下一世，這樣我的心就會好過一點，但是苦的是，人生並不能交換。
每隔一陣子，我就會把這些病人從頭到尾想過一遍。這些死在我手裡的病人，關於他們怎麼死的，發生了什麼事，我沒有一個忘記。然後我會再想曾經幫助過的病人。我必須反向說服自己，其實自己幫助過很多病人。假如不是我，很多病人早就死了，好像做了一件好事，就可以抵消做了一件壞事所帶來的罪惡，這樣我也會好過一點。但是關於那些我救活的病人，我怎麼努力地想，就是沒有一個記得，就好像電影裡的台詞，幸福從來都不是故事，悲傷才是，悲傷的故事，從來不會忘記。
這個世界其實非常殘忍，《國家地理頻道》曾經對飛行安全做過一系列的影片，描述這個殘忍的規則。「飛行安全要能進步，有賴飛安事故的發生。」從檢討飛安事故的發生，才能建立標準的作業流程，避免下一次事故再次發生。同樣的道理，病人安全要能提升，醫師的經驗要能成熟，必須要有病安事件的發生，因為發生了這些併發症，我們才能徹底檢討，從中學習經驗，明天才有機會成為更好的醫師。病人安全，必須要有人流血付出代價，只是這些代價往往都超過病人、還有醫者自身的負荷。
既然飛行跟麻醉那麼類似，那你們知道機師跟麻醉醫師最大的差別在哪裡嗎？最大的差別在於每一次的飛安事故裡，機師為了拯救乘客，幾乎都是以身殞命，他也以生命付出了代價，所以沒有人會苛責他們。但是麻醉醫師在一次次的病安事故裡，卻必須獨自活下來，在往後餘生的時間裡，接受自己心的折磨，直到有一天自己也面臨了死亡，我才能真正得到自由。

""The place where the anesthesiologist's soul is"": Every once in a while, I will think about the patients who died in my hands.
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is that every few moments, I will think about these patients from beginning to end. These patients who died in my hands, about what happened to them, what happened, I did not forget.



Text: Aorta

Sometimes someone will describe it like this, and the anesthesiologist's work is a bit like the pilot. The pilot's job is to safely transport the passenger to the next destination, and the anesthesiologist safely escorts the patient to the future.
The take-off, high-altitude driving and landing of the aircraft are similar to the induction of anesthesia, the maintenance of the operation, and the recovery of anesthesia. The pilot operated the aircraft, and various electronic screens told him various information to let the pilot judge how to safely fly the aircraft to another place. The anesthesiologist used various physiological monitors to tell us the current physiological condition of the patient and let us assist the patient. Safely through the damage and pain caused by surgery.
At that time, I was still a young attending physician, and I once took a resident to do heart surgery. The patient of the day was expected to undergo aortic valve replacement because of a severe aortic valve regurgitation. Aortic valve counterflow surgery The most easily overlooked condition during anesthesia is that the blood pressure presented by the arterial catheter is not as accurate.
Blood pressure is divided into systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. In general patients, we care about the patient's systolic blood pressure, because the systolic blood pressure is high enough, and the diastolic blood pressure is not too low. Diastolic blood pressure represents the pressure of coronary perfusion of the heart. If it is too low, the heart will be injured by myocardial cells due to lack of oxygen.
However, in patients with aortic regurgitation, the systolic blood pressure of the arterial catheter will tend to overestimate the patient's systolic blood pressure due to the resonance of the tube. The diastolic blood pressure will drop very low, resulting in insufficient heart perfusion. Because of the inaccurate relationship between blood pressure, after such an anesthesia, the blood pressure of the arterial catheter should be maintained higher than usual to maintain adequate cardiac perfusion.
In Taiwan, an anesthesiologist had to anesthetize 4 patients at the same time. After completing the anesthesia induction, I explained the matters that the resident should pay attention to and then left the other room to help the patient anesthetize. When I was busy with other patients, I went back and found that the patient had only 90 systolic blood pressure. This blood pressure is enough for the average patient, but it is too low for the aortic reflux patient. I quickly called the resident to raise the patient's blood pressure, but it was too late.
The blood pressure went down all the way, I played a lot of tonic, how can I not pull it up. Once the pressure of the heart perfusion is not enough, the cardiomyocytes will start to suffer from hypoxia, and the injured heart will not be able to get blood, and the heart will become more and more swollen. In the swollen heart, the pressure in the heart chamber will become higher and higher, which in turn will oppress the blood vessels of the heart, causing the blood to percolate worse, and the whole falls into a vicious circle, which eventually leads to heart failure.
Because blood pressure can't be pulled up, we have to go to the extracorporeal circulation urgently. Under such conditions, how difficult is it to go to the extracorporeal circulation urgently? Aortic catheter puncture, venous drainage tube placement, clamping the aorta at the first time, cutting the aorta at the same time, finding the coronary artery, injecting the myocardial protective solution, stopping the heart, and simultaneously cooling the heart to protect the heart, the action is very degenerate Exquisite, it is possible to complete all procedures. If the hands and feet are not fast enough, the patient's heart will swell more and the injury will be more serious... The surgeon who just took the knife was also the young attending physician. Before the heart stopped, I watched the heart swell more and jumped twice.
After the operation, the heart did not beat again. We put the aortic balloon pump, hoping to help the patient's heart beat. A week later, the patient died of heart failure. I know that the patient's condition is not serious enough to die. If I didn't leave the room, go to another room to do anesthesia induction, or if I have enough hands and feet, go back 10 minutes earlier, maybe he won't die. He probably lived for less than 10 years. If you know that the patient's condition is not serious enough to die, but he has not been able to come over, in the future life, how should I face myself? This matter has become a burden and secret in my heart.
As time passed, my heart was more and more secret. Every few years, I will lose a patient. At that time, I was working in the night shift. One patient had a knife because of intestinal obstruction. The most terrible place for intestinal obstruction was that the patient might vomit before and after anesthesia. If the vomit enters the respiratory tract, it will be accompanied by aspiration pneumonia. In severe cases, it may even die.
In order to protect the patient's respiratory tract, the safest method of anesthesia for this patient is to awake the intubation, which means that the patient is placed in the endotracheal tube and then the patient is asleep. But waking intubation is very painful. We rarely do this. The eclectic approach is to quickly intubate, let the patient fall asleep, and establish the endotracheal tube in the shortest possible time. I decided to take the latter.
When I hit the anesthetic and provoked the patient's throat, the esophagus was opened by me. I only saw a lot of liquid in the esophageal opening, drowning the entire respiratory tract, no matter how much I pumped.
Halfway through the operation, the patient's blood oxygen began to fall down, and this aspiration pneumonia came quickly and urgently. At the end of the operation, the patient has an acute pulmonary edema respiratory distress syndrome. In fact, when we reach this point, we still have a chance to save him. As long as the leaf membrane is used, there is still a chance. But at the time, within the 2,300 km of the entire Huadong area, there were only two leaf membranes, and they were all in use. A week later, I finally waited for the Ye Ke membrane, and the patient died just because of multiple organ failure.
The operation was successful, but the patient died in the end, and the result was really stupid to be unacceptable. In fact, I only need to help him to wake up, or if I move for 3 seconds, he may not die. He probably lived for less than 20 years.
When we first started living liver transplantation, we also paid a painful price. At that time, it took about 20 hours for a surgery, and it was common for patients to lose tens of thousands of milliliters of blood.
At that time, just after midnight, the operation was almost over, and I was exhausted. The patient has a faster heartbeat because of excessive blood loss. At that time, I have noticed that the patient's ECG Q wave and T wave are getting longer and longer.
The QT wave spacing is getting longer and longer, and finally the R wave hits the T wave (R on T), resulting in a fatal arrhythmia. This irregular heart rhythm may be related to low blood magnesium. There are very few such complications. I have only read them in books. I have never seen them since I was a doctor. And really want to accurately measure the length of the QT wave, do a 12-lead ECG, and finally open the root number, divide by a number to do the heart rate correction, it is not easy to do this when the knife is opened, and the surgery has been To be over, it is not in my heart.
Unexpectedly, at the end of the operation, there was a fatal arrhythmia. We helped the patient to shock and gave CPR, and it took about 30 seconds to rescue the patient. But after a week, the patient still died because the transplanted liver was too small and dysfunctional. Transplanted liver function is not good, there may be many reasons, in fact, no one can determine what the real cause is, but how much may be related to arrhythmia leading to ischemic necrosis. I seem to owe this patient a life, and I remember she has a daughter. I saw her daughter when I went to the preoperative visit. I owe her daughter a complete home, a complete life.
I later discovered that the more I owe it. If life can be exchanged, I am willing to use the rest of my life to exchange them and return them to me. If the life is not enough, then I will give them the life expectancy of the afterlife. If it is not enough, then the next life, so my heart will be better, but the bitter thing is that life can not be exchanged.
Every once in a while, I will think about these patients from beginning to end. These patients who died in my hands, about what happened to them, what happened, I did not forget. Then I will think again about the patients I have helped. I have to convince myself in the opposite direction that I have actually helped many patients. If it weren't for me, many patients would have died long ago. It seems that doing a good thing can offset the evils caused by doing a bad thing, so I will be better. But about the patients I saved, how can I think hard, that is, no one remembers, just like the lines in the movie, happiness is never a story, sadness is a sad story, never forgetting.
The world is actually very cruel. National Geographic Channel has done a series of films on flight safety to describe this cruel rule. ""Flight safety needs to be improved, depending on the occurrence of the Fei'an accident."" From the review of the Fei'an accident, a standard operating procedure can be established to prevent the next accident from happening again. By the same token, patient safety should be improved, physician experience must be mature, and there must be a sickness incident. Because of these complications, we can thoroughly review and learn from it, and have a chance to become better tomorrow. Physician. Patient safety, there must be someone to bleed to pay the price, but these costs often exceed the patient's and the doctor's own load.
Since the flight is similar to anesthesia, do you know the biggest difference between the pilot and the anesthesiologist? The biggest difference is that in every Fei'an accident, the pilots almost killed themselves in order to save the passengers. He also paid the price for his life, so no one would blame them. However, in an accidental illness, the anesthesiologist must survive alone, and in the rest of his life, accept his own heart, until one day he is also facing death, and I can truly be free.

The bloody town doctor ""Aorta"" ‧ warm heart fans favorite, deep healing, for your body, heart pain! A story about the soul of the human being, the struggle of humanity and thinking... the precious documentary of medical humanities. The touch between doctors and illnesses is the solution to life trials and end!
Dai Zhengde (Professor of Medical Ethics, Medical Ethics, Former Director of the International Society for Clinical Life Medicine Ethics, and F. Jahr Award, winner of 2019): Every article of the aortic physician is rich. Touched stories and reflections on human nature. This book should be considered by every medical staff member and a documentary of medical humanities.
Lai Qiwan (Heh Medical Medical Education Lecture Professor and Neurology Attending Physician): An anesthesiologist with the pseudonym ""Aorta"", who is diligent in writing, and sometimes publishes articles on the ""Medical Platform"". Empathy for the patient, family members, touching and touching.
Born to be lazy, for the study of thesis, ascending, etc., the ""agron"" that the professor was not interested in, after learning, he decided to take another path - going to the countryside, bringing the anesthesia and pain treatment taught by the teacher to the most remote The most no corner where doctors are going.
At the same time, he runs a fan page on Facebook, where the anesthesiologist's soul is. These notes are not related to medical papers, but his interaction with patients and the story of fighting pain. However, the struggles of the human mind and the engraving of humanity are all precious and documentary of medical humanities. Among them, the interaction between medical treatment and illness is the solution of life trial and the end!
