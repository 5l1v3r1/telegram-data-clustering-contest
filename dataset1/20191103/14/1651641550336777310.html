      <h1>Microsoft thinks we should have 3 day weekends</h1>

      <p>Microsoft’s focus as a company is on productivity, but a recent experiment by Microsoft Japan suggests with a 4-day workweek we may be more productive if we work less.</p>
      <p>In particular, it shows that a shorter workweek can actually impact productivity positively.</p>
      <p>In August this year, Microsoft Japan ran an experiment where for one month they had a 3 day weekend, taken Friday off. This was paid leave and did not impact the worker’s usual vacation allocation.</p>
      <p>Some results were predictable.</p>

      <p>Workers were happier and took  25.4 percent fewer days off during the month.</p>
      <p>There were also savings from spending less time at work.  23.1 percent less electricity was used and 58.7 percent fewer pages were printed.</p>
      <p>More importantly from a bottom-line standpoint, however, productivity went up 39.9%, as fewer and shorter meetings were held, often virtually rather than in person.</p>
      <p>In the end, the project had 92.1 percent employee approval, suggesting workers were happy with getting more done in less time.</p>
      <p>The trial involved 2,300 employees, and Microsoft is looking to repeat it next summer.</p>
      <p>While the approach may not work for everyone, I am sure many of us would appreciate giving a 4-day workweek a try in our own workplaces.</p>
