《禮悟》：真正生病的人不是病人，而是不敢面對疾病的人
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是「你們這種人，就是自己愛亂玩，才會得到這種病。」我詫異至極，這樣的批判，不是來自一個路人，而是一個專業的醫師。

真正生病的人不是病人，而是不敢面對疾病的人
「挫折」的逆襲：你曾經被歧視、霸凌或不公平的對待嗎？你都怎麼面對那些傷痛呢？
H是我在精神病院那半年認識的朋友，更準確地說，他是睡在我隔壁床的室友。我們在那半年裡聊了許多，卻從來沒有問過對方：「你為什麼會來這裡呢？」
我只知道，他大學念的是心理系，跟幫助我很多的那位女心理師是同班同學。
兩年後我從美國念完書回來，我打電話約H見面，想找他敘敘舊。
「我當時進精神病院的原因跟你一樣。」他在咖啡廳裡突然跟我說。
坦白說我很意外，我從沒問起，因為那是我當時保護自己的方法，如果你不希望別人問起你來的理由，那你也別問別人來的原因。從外面走進這裡，看似短短的幾步路程，對那些終於走進這裡的人來說，卻是一條遙遠而坎坷的路啊！這裡最不缺乏的，就是傷心的故事，所以，又何苦多問？
我對他笑了笑，難怪，我們當時那麼投緣。
「然後，我前幾天剛去檢驗所檢查，確定自己得了愛滋病。」他說。
「愛滋病」這個在當時還不常見的名詞，就在那剎那，從報紙、電視報導的遙遠彼端，迅速真實地呈現在我面前。
我鼓勵他不要放棄，並且說服他去接受治療。很快地我們就相約在台北某間知名教學醫院的診間。
明明是感染科的診間，不知為何，整個空間那麼開放，連旁邊的活動屏風都沒有人想要為他拉上。
醫師一直在問他的交友狀況，音量越來越大聲，而且越來越嚴厲，像一個警察，而不是醫師。我在他旁邊陪伴著，連我，都覺得難堪而不舒服。
「你們這種人，就是自己愛亂玩，才會得到這種病。」我詫異至極，這樣的批判，不是來自一個路人，而是一個專業的醫師。
「你們可以尊重病人一點嗎？難道他是故意想生病的嗎？」我忍不住喊出來，站起來拉著朋友的手說：「我們走，我們去別的醫院看！」
我拉著他往外面走，醫院的長廊又黑又長，幾乎看不見光的所在……我逃離家鄉，到海外漂泊了一圈，終於回來，卻發現原來自己依然被囚禁在偏見的牢籠裡。
愛滋病感染者就一定是「性濫交」者？性交幾次得病算是「性濫交」？異性戀者的婚前性行為算不算「性濫交」？而那些鄙視的人，究竟鄙視的是同性戀？還是性濫交？而我們在看待這件事情的時候，究竟是用一個醫學的角度，還是越位成為了上帝，認為那就是上帝降給同性戀者的懲罰？
事實是，愛滋病感染的管道很多，也不只在同性的性行為之間才會傳染。甚至，只要一次的意外，就可以感染。更何況，是在大家對愛滋病還那麼陌生的30年前，沒有人想到，也許只是一次慾望的失控，甚至是一次真心真意的結合，就會讓你染上這個新世紀的黑死病。
這些道理，一般人可以不懂，可是身為第一線的醫療人員，都還存在著這樣狹隘的偏見，那我也真的難免會懷疑，你們在看待每一位病人的時候，是不是也都有你們認為的「罪有應得」？譬如，肺癌就是抽菸活該，燙傷就是自己不小心……雖然這樣的想法或許也是我狹隘的偏見。
人之所以為人，最獨特的情操就是「悲憫」，是能夠體諒別人的無助，甚至後悔。而這樣的情懷，我認為是醫療人員最基本的專業。
後來，我又帶著他去了榮總。
在此，我要向榮總的醫護人員致上最高的敬意。所幸，有了之前那所教學醫院的挫折對比，我才知道，原來榮總的醫師、護士、醫療環境，對待愛滋病患，是這般的友善和慈悲，原來，這個世界真的存在著白袍天使。
我也才真的明白，原來真正生病的人不是病人，而是不敢面對疾病的人。
病人只要勇敢接受治療，就有機會好，可是用偏見看待世界的人，終其一生箝制的，經常還是自己。
30年後，在愛滋病的防治已經成為大家共同的常識，控制愛滋病的藥物也越來越進步的情況下，有許多病患已經獲得控制幾近痊癒；真心希望，那些願意放下偏見的人，也能越來越多，就像文明的演化一樣。
獻給你的禮悟：如果你曾經是被歧視、霸凌的受害者。恭喜你，因為你一定是一位有同理心的「健康人」。真正要接受治療的是那群有偏見的人。

""Lian Wu"": The person who is really sick is not a patient, but a person who does not dare to face the disease.
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is ""you like this, you just love to play, you will get this disease."" I am very surprised, this criticism is not from a passerby, but a professional physician.



Text: Jiang Chengyu
The person who is really sick is not a patient, but a person who does not dare to face the disease.
Counterattack of ""frustration"": Have you ever been discriminated against, bullied or unfairly treated? How do you face those injuries?
H is a friend I met in the psychiatric hospital for the past six months. More precisely, he is a roommate who sleeps in my next bed. We talked a lot during the past six months, but never asked each other: ""Why are you here?""
I only know that his university is in the Department of Psychology, and the female psychologist who helped me a lot is a classmate.
Two years later, I finished reading from the United States. I called H to meet and wanted to find him.
""The reason I went to a mental hospital was the same as you."" He suddenly told me in the coffee shop.
Frankly, I was surprised. I never asked, because that was the way I used to protect myself. If you don't want others to ask you why, don't ask others why. Walking into the area from the outside, it seems like a short walk, for those who finally walked in, it is a distant and bumpy road! The most lacking here is the sad story, so why bother to ask?
I smiled at him, no wonder, we were so close.
""Then, I just went to the inspection office a few days ago to make sure I got AIDS,"" he said.
The term ""AIDS"", which was not common at the time, was immediately and truthfully presented to me from the distant side of newspapers and television reports.
I encourage him not to give up and persuade him to receive treatment. Soon we met at a clinic in a well-known teaching hospital in Taipei.
It is clearly the clinic of the infection department. I don't know why, the whole space is so open, and no one wants to pull him up next to the screen of the activity.
Physicians have been asking his friends about the situation, the volume is getting louder and louder, and more and more severe, like a policeman, not a doctor. I was accompanied by him, and even I felt embarrassed and uncomfortable.
""You people like you, you love to play, you will get this disease."" I am very surprised, this criticism is not from a passerby, but a professional physician.
""Can you respect the patient? Do he deliberately want to get sick?"" I couldn't help but shout out and stood up and took the friend's hand and said, ""Let's go, let's go to another hospital!""
I took him outside and the hospital's promenade was dark and long. I could barely see the light... I fled my hometown, drifted overseas and finally came back, only to find that I was still imprisoned in a cage of prejudice. in.
People infected with AIDS must be ""sexual promiscuity""? Is it a sexual promiscuity to get sexual intercourse several times? Is premarital sex of heterosexuals considered ""sexual promiscuity""? And those who despise, are they despising homosexuality? Or sexual promiscuity? And when we look at this matter, is it a medical point of view, or is it an offside to become God, and that is the punishment that God gave to homosexuals?
The truth is that there are many channels for AIDS infection, and it is not only contagious between same-sex sex. Even if you have an accident, you can get infected. What's more, 30 years ago, when everyone was so strange to AIDS, no one thought that maybe it was just a loss of control of desire, even a combination of sincerity and trueness, which would make you suffer from the black death of this new century.
These reasons, the average person can not understand, but as the front line of medical personnel, there are still such narrow prejudice, then I really inevitably doubt, when you look at each patient, is it also Do you think that ""sin is deserved""? For example, lung cancer is a smoking job, and scalding is not careful... although such an idea may be my narrow prejudice.
The most unique sentiment is the ""sorrowfulness"" of people, the ability to understand others' helplessness, and even regret. And this kind of feeling, I think is the most basic professional of medical personnel.
Later, I took him to Rong.
Here, I would like to pay the highest respect to the medical staff of Rong. Fortunately, with the comparison of the frustrations of the teaching hospitals before, I realized that the doctors, nurses, and medical environment of Rong Zong were so friendly and compassionate to the AIDS patients. It turned out that there is a white robe in the world. angel.
I also really understand that the person who is really sick is not a patient, but a person who does not dare to face the disease.
As long as the patient is brave enough to receive treatment, there is a good chance, but those who look at the world with prejudice will eventually be restrained by their own lives.
Thirty years later, in the prevention and treatment of AIDS has become common sense, and the drugs that control AIDS are getting more and more advanced. Many patients have been controlled to recover. I sincerely hope that those who are willing to let go of their prejudice also More and more, just like the evolution of civilization.
Dedication to you: If you have been a victim of discrimination and bullying. Congratulations, because you must be an empathetic ""healthy person."" What is really to be treated is the group of prejudiced people.

2017.09.01 Fate suddenly launched a ""reverse attack"" on him, a drowning accident, accompanied by a 16-year partner, turned into a vegetative. The sudden change of life is like a 921 earthquake that has experienced a physical and mental, but at the same time it has also achieved the greatest quenching chain. For the first time in seclusion, for the first time, he decided to tell everyone his story--
The young man, confused with sexual orientation and even committed suicide many times, struggled to self in negation. With his enthusiasm for work and the perseverance he said, at the age of 28, he became a popular AE in Ogilvy & Mather. When he was 35, he became a super agent and successfully pushed Jolin Tsai, Luo Zhixiang and Yang Yulin to the throne. At the age of 40, he and his life loved to hold a gay wedding. When everyone thinks that his story will have a happy ending, he will see hell on the eve of his 48th birthday...
This book is the result of his repeated life and counterattacks. In the face of the unavoidable setbacks and separations of life, he told us that even if it is impossible to grasp the various adversities in life, how to ""see"" it is always under my control. When we are faced with fear, pressure, frustration, regret, loneliness, we resist and flee, but we do not know that they are gifts that come down from heaven, until we experience the acceptance, the heart is convinced, and then we become ""rites.""
I hope that everyone who has been attacked by fate and who is alone in the middle of the night can find the courage to move forward.
