《麻醉醫師靈魂所在的地方》：離開的人不痛了，獨活的人卻必須痛一輩子
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是關於病人還有他們說的故事，一旦他們說了，就會像印痕一樣永遠留在腦海裡；每當他們回診的時候，就像老電影一樣，在腦海裡又重新播放一次。



文：主動脈
獨活
「增生療法」是一種藉由注射高濃度的葡萄糖水，或血小板濃縮液至受傷的軟組織，如韌帶或是軟骨，先製造短暫的局部發炎反應，以重新啟動軟組織的增生機制，促進軟組織的自行修復，達到止痛的目的。
用增生療法來止痛有一些缺點，第一、多點注射，韌帶或是關節損傷通常不是單一條韌帶受傷造成的，為了強化整個關節，所以必須多點注射；第二、因為要靠組織重新生長修復，所以必須每兩到三個禮拜注射一次。綜合這兩個缺點，做增生治療的意思就是需要時間，所以我並不是那麼喜歡做增生治療。
我不喜歡做增生治療，並不代表我沒有時間或耐心，而是做治療的這一段時間，我必須跟病人聊天，但是大多數的麻醉醫師其實並不喜歡跟病人聊天。
聊天的內容多數是病人對抗疼痛的故事：他們怎麼受傷的、疼痛怎麼干擾他們的生活、治療後疼痛有沒有受到控制等等。但是每兩個禮拜來一次門診，久了之後這聊天的內容就遠遠超過了疼痛。
阿嬤大概70多歲吧，她每次都一個人來，所以我猜阿公應該已經不在了。她說年輕的時候，在溪底撿一些玉石，靠買賣玉石維生；這些玉石動不動就2、30公斤，要從溪底揹上岸來，久了之後，肩膀跟膝蓋都發生退化性關節炎。
一般看到這麼嚴重的退化性關節炎，我都直接叫病人去開刀，覺得治療也是枉然；但是病人說她不想開刀，所以也就姑且幫她治療，沒想到治療的效果竟然遠遠超過預期。
阿嬤說她本來每天坐著不想走路，每走幾步路就痛到想要坐下來休息，現在雖然沒有痊癒，但是已經可以走好長一段路。她覺得非常高興，所以每隔一陣子就回來打一次針當做保養。
她說女兒本來要陪她來的，但是阿嬤說不用。她女兒在小鎮再過去的另一個鎮的農會上班，上班時會經過醫院，所以就載阿嬤來，等到做完治療之後，阿嬤再自己坐車回家。阿嬤說，最近她叫女兒回去跟她一起住，我一開始以為是她的女兒離婚了，沒想到她說她的女婿死了。
女婿在另一個農會上班，應該是高階的主管，有自己的辦公室。她說那個工作非常勞心。有一天他的同事都沒看到他從辦公室出來，下班時間到了還是沒看到人，打電話到辦公室也沒有人接，破門而入後，發現他坐在辦公椅上，然後頭整個埋在辦公桌的文件裡，怎麼叫都叫不醒。
送到我們醫院，診斷是腦出血。我一聽就知道這種病人幾乎沒有機會。年輕人會腦出血，最多的原因是動脈瘤破裂，這種動脈瘤破裂導致的出血，幾乎都會在第一時間死亡，沒有死亡的也會腦死，最後幾乎都成為器官捐贈者。
我們將病人轉送到大醫院，儘管接受了緊急開腦減壓，病人還是回天乏術。醫師勸他們放棄急救。阿嬤說她進加護病房看女婿最後一眼，那時候醫療人員正在壓胸，女婿胸口的肌膚已經被電擊成一片焦黑，最後他們才決定讓他走。
關於病人還有他們說的故事，一旦他們說了，就會像印痕一樣永遠留在腦海裡；每當他們回診的時候，就像老電影一樣，在腦海裡又重新播放一次。有時候一位病人的故事又跟另一個病人的故事有共通處，所以你就從這個病人又聯想到另外一位病人。
他原本在一座礦場裡擔任怪手司機，在一場工安意外裡，他的右手臂整個被怪手扯斷，我們花了20個小時才把他的右手重新接回去。接回去後，手臂並沒有恢復正常的功能，因為臂叢神經損傷的關係，右手掌整個攣縮，只剩下少許功能，而且併發嚴重的神經痛。
他在我的門診裡追蹤，時間長到我連他的家人都認識。他媽媽罹患有糖尿病，控制得不是很好，眼睛產生糖尿病視網膜病變，慢慢的就看不到了；接著腎臟衰竭，開始洗腎；再過不久，中風半身癱瘓，長期臥床。
為了照顧臥床的母親，他辭去了工作，每個月就靠社會補助金過活。他說有時候他的手已經很痛了，還要忍著痛用另外一隻手幫母親翻身、換尿布、洗澡。有一天他的母親受不了了，就告訴他說，假如你撐不下去了，就去買一罐農藥回來，放在樓梯口，她雖然眼睛看不到了，但是一定找得到……。
原本以為環境已經糟到不會再糟了，他的哥哥還被診斷出肝癌末期，離開的時候，留下了一個念高中的女兒。
他那一天回診的時候話很少，低著頭喃喃自語：「他就把這一切都留給我了，就這樣走了。」他說這句話時，就好像在指責自己的哥哥是一個不負責任的人。
知道這些故事是令人痛苦的，有時候我不明白，為什麼病人要讓我覺得痛苦，他們為什麼要告訴我這些呢？
而離開的人是幸福的，或者說是幸運的，他們永遠都不會再痛了，而獨活的人卻必須痛一輩子。

""The place where the anesthesiologist's soul is located"": The person who leaves is not hurting, but the person who lives alone must suffer for a lifetime.
03 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Summary


What we want you to know is about the patients and the stories they say. Once they say them, they will stay in their minds forever like imprints; whenever they return to the clinic, like old movies, they will reappear in their minds. Play once.



Text: Aorta
live alone
""Proliferation therapy"" is a method of creating a transient local inflammatory response by injecting a high concentration of glucose water, or a platelet concentrate into an injured soft tissue, such as a ligament or cartilage, to restart the soft tissue proliferation mechanism and promote soft tissue self-initiation. Repair to achieve the purpose of pain relief.
There are some disadvantages to using proliferative therapy to relieve pain. The first, multi-point injection, ligament or joint damage is usually not caused by a single ligament injury. In order to strengthen the whole joint, more injections must be made. Second, because of tissue re-growth. Repair, so it must be injected every two to three weeks. Combining these two shortcomings, the meaning of hyperplastic treatment is that it takes time, so I don't like to do hyperplasia treatment.
I don't like to do hyperplasia treatment. It doesn't mean I don't have time or patience. Instead, I have to talk to the patient during this period of treatment. But most anesthesiologists don't really like to talk to patients.
Most of the content of the chat is the story of the patient's fight against pain: how they are injured, how the pain interferes with their lives, whether the pain is controlled after treatment, and so on. But every two weeks, I came to the clinic. After a long time, the content of this chat far exceeded the pain.
Aunt is probably in her 70s. She comes alone every time, so I guess Ah Gong should be gone. She said that when she was young, she would hold some jade at the bottom of the stream and live on the sale of jade. These jade can move 2, 30 kilograms from the bottom of the stream. After a long time, degenerative arthritis occurs in the shoulders and knees.
Generally seeing such severe degenerative arthritis, I directly called the patient to open the knife, and felt that the treatment was also awkward; but the patient said that she did not want to open the knife, so she also helped her to treat it. I did not expect the treatment effect to far exceed expectations.
Aunt said that she used to sit every day and didn't want to walk. Every time she walked a few steps, she felt that she wanted to sit down and rest. Now, although she has not recovered, she can already go a long way. She felt very happy, so she came back for a while and used it as a maintenance.
She said that her daughter had to accompany her, but Aunt said no. Her daughter went to work in the farmer's association in another town in the town. When she went to work, she passed the hospital, so she took the aunt and waited until after the treatment, the aunt went home by car. Aunt said that she recently asked her daughter to go back to live with her. I thought it was her daughter who divorced. I didn't expect her to say that her son-in-law died.
Nüwa is working at another peasant association. She should be a high-ranking supervisor and have her own office. She said that the job was very hard work. One day, his colleagues didn't see him coming out of the office. When he got off work, he still didn't see anyone. When he called the office, no one answered. After breaking the door, he found him sitting in the office chair and then buried the whole head. In the file of the desk, how to call it is not awake.
Sent to our hospital, the diagnosis is cerebral hemorrhage. As soon as I heard it, I knew that this patient had almost no chance. The most common cause of cerebral hemorrhage in young people is the rupture of the aneurysm. The bleeding caused by the rupture of the aneurysm will almost always die in the first time. If there is no death, it will die in the brain. In the end, it will almost become an organ donor.
We transferred the patient to the big hospital, and despite the emergency decompression of the brain, the patient was still devoid of surgery. The doctor advised them to give up first aid. Aunt said that she went to the intensive care unit to see the last look of the son-in-law. At that time, the medical staff was pressing the chest, and the skin of the female's chest had been shocked into a blackened heart. Finally, they decided to let him go.
As for the patients and the stories they said, once they say them, they will stay in their minds forever like imprints; whenever they return to the clinic, they will replay them in their minds just like old movies. Sometimes the story of one patient has something in common with the story of another patient, so you think of another patient from this patient.
He used to be a strange driver in a mine. In a work accident, his right arm was completely broken by a strange hand. It took us 20 hours to reconnect his right hand. After receiving it, the arm did not return to normal function. Because of the brachial plexus injury, the right palm was curled up, leaving only a few functions, and complicated with severe neuralgia.
He followed my clinic and it was so long that I knew even his family. His mother had diabetes, and her control was not very good. The eyes developed diabetic retinopathy, which was slowly invisible. Then kidney failure began to wash the kidneys. Soon after, the stroke was half-length and stayed in bed for a long time.
In order to take care of the mother who is in bed, he quit his job and lived on a social subsidy every month. He said that sometimes his hand was already very painful, but he still had to use another hand to help his mother turn over, change diapers, and take a bath. One day his mother couldn't stand it. He told him that if you can't keep going, you can buy a can of pesticide and come back to the stairs. Although she can't see her eyes, she must find it...
Originally thought that the environment was so bad that it would not be worse, his brother was diagnosed with the end of liver cancer. When he left, he left a daughter who was in high school.
When he returned to the day, he had very few words. He lowered his head and muttered to himself: ""He left all this to me, so he left."" When he said this, it was like accusing his brother. An irresponsible person.
Knowing these stories is painful. Sometimes I don't understand why patients want me to feel pain. Why do they tell me this?
The people who leave are happy, or fortunate, they will never hurt again, but those who live alone must suffer for a lifetime.
