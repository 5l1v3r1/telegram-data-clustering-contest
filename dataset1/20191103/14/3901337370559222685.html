        <b>Telkom Knockout</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Chippa United v Mamelodi Sundowns</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 03 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium</p>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns will be wary of a cup upset when visit Chippa United in the Telkom Knockout quarter-finals on Sunday afternoon at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.</p>
      <p>The match is scheduled to get underway at 15h00.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians got to this stage of the tournament after hammering AmaZulu 5-0 in the first round, but they went on to lose 2-0 to Kaizer Chiefs in the league last weekend.</p>
      <p>Sundowns have won three League Cup titles in their history, the last of which was in 2015 after beating Steve Komphela's Chiefs 3-1 in the final. Last season, they reached the quarter-finals of this tournament but they were knocked out by eventual winners Baroka FC.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Chilli Boys won their first game of the season by knocking out Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in the first round clash in Norman Mapeza's first game in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>The men from Port Elizabeth weren't able to build on that victory after they suffered a 2-0 to Highlands Park in Tembisa.</p>
      <p>These two sides have already met in the Absa Premiership this season, with Chippa netting in the dying stages to secure a 1-1 draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.</p>
