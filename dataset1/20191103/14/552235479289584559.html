      <h1>Ross Wilson in Rangers grand entrance as sporting director is front and centre at Hampden</h1>
      <h2>The 36-year-old was pictured in club colours before the Betfred Cup semi-final against Hearts at Hampden.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-03T14:19:02+00:00">03 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers' sporting director <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-wilson">Ross Wilson</a> is ready to get down to business as he was snapped alongside his new team ahead of today's Betfred Cup semi-final with Hearts.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old, who was appointed to the role last month, was pictured in club colours as he spoke with managing director Stewart Robertson ahead of the Hampden showpiece.</p>
      <p>Wilson was targeted by the Ibrox side as a replacement for Mark Allen and has been patiently waiting to begin after leaving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>The Scot spent four years with the Saints and previously turned down <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers'</a> advances before they made their move Allen in 2017.</p>

      <p>And the former Falkirk talent-spotter appears raring to go as he looks to give his side a recruitment edge with Rangers desperate to end Celtic's Scottish football stranglehold.</p>
      <p>But he could face some transfer dilemmas with the club announcing an Â£11m loss during their annual accounts on Friday.</p>
      <p>The future of star striker Alfredo Morelos, who has broached an Ibrox exit, will be high up on his agenda.</p>

      <p>A victory today for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> 's side will secure a showdown with their city rivals on December 8.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool icon spoke last month about his excitement of forging a strong relationship with his new recruitment specialist.</p>
      <p>He said: "I've had two or three really long, in-depth conversations, they will remain private.</p>
      <p>"I have to give the club credit for a finding replacement and I am really looking forward to working with Ross.</p>
      <p>"We can't wait to start the relationship."</p>
