      <p>Peru Two Michaella McCollum has complained about the lack of privacy in prison which meant she had to regularly advert her eyes to inmates having sex.</p>
      <p>The convicted drugs mule, who was locked up for trying to smuggle £1.5m-worth of cocaine in her luggage, said the women would openly get together behind bars.</p>
      <p>She often "didn’t know where to look" but was "barely acknowledged".</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old claims some of the female inmates were known as “chetos” and used for sex, but many of the other prisoners craving affection would also join in.</p>

      <p>Writing in her new book, You'll Never See Daylight Again, she said: “When you’re sharing a bedroom with 99 other people any right of privacy is out the window.</p>
      <p>“You see each other shower, you see everyone peeing, what’s a bit of sex between you and your most intimate 200 mates? I have to admit to being surprised by a couple of the relationships.</p>
      <p>“The chetos signposted their sexuality. Any time they hooked up with one of the more feminine inmates I wasn’t surprised, except when they found each other.</p>

      <p>“Others spent so much time showing me pictures of their children and husbands I had to do a double take when I saw them face down in someone else’s cleavage.</p>
      <p>"When their bloke visited, they’d be all over him. But for those cold winter nights in between they had alternative sources of comfort.</p>
      <p>“And when they got down to it they were so passionate it was like the world was ending. I was transfixed by their intensity. I’d never seen anything like it.”</p>

      <p>Michaella, from Northern Ireland, was 20 when she and pal Melissa Reid, from Scotland, were arrested in the airport at the capital city of Lima in 2013.</p>
      <p>She was initially sentenced to more than six years behind bars, but served just over two years in the maximum security prison.</p>
      <p>She was released in March 2016 and has since given birth to twin boys.</p>
      <p>Describing one sex act between two inmates, she said: "I was chatting when I got a nudge from the girl on the other side of me. I turned around.</p>

      <p>“The girl on the other side of her was off the bench, her trousers and pants round her ankles, and my neighbour was [performing a sex act].</p>
      <p>“Just like that, right next to me, in front of hundreds of prying eyes. It was a weird situation.</p>
      <p>“Every single person around the table carried on sewing and chatting or watching as if it was the most normal thing in the world.”</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/peru-two-drug-mule-stripped-20734127">previously reported</a> Michaella also claimed she was handcuffed, stripped naked and told she'd "never see daylight again".</p>
