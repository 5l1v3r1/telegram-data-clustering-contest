      <p>RIO DE JANEIRO:Â Brazil's auction of drilling rights to four deep-sea oil fields raised a disappointing US$17 billion on Wednesday (Nov 6), officials said, well short of expectations for the highly-anticipated mega sale.</p>
      <p>The government had hoped to collect more than US$26 billion from the auction of so-called pre-salt reserves trapped beneath the ocean floor off Brazil's southeast coast.</p>

      <p>A dozen oil majors had signed up to bid for the blocks that are estimated to contain as much as 15 billion barrels of oil - nearly double the size of Norway's reserves.</p>
      <p>Two of the four blocks did not receive a bid.</p>
      <p>"It's a historic day for Brazil's oil sector," Decio Oddone, head of the National Petroleum Agency, said earlier, as the sale in Rio de Janeiro got under way.</p>
      <p>The auction comes after President Jair Bolsonaro's recent push in Saudi Arabia for the Latin American country to be included in the OPEC oil producing cartel.</p>
      <p>The government had hoped the sale could turn the country into the world's fifth largest producer in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>It ranked ninth in 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p>
      <p>Brazil's state-owned oil giant Petrobras was among the bidders that also included ExxonMobil, Shell and China's CNOOC.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CASH BOON FOR GOVERNMENT?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike previous oil field sales, the areas up for grabs had already been explored by Petrobras, reducing the risk for buyers.</p>
      <p>Prices were fixed and the winners were companies offering the largest cut of oil to the government.</p>
      <p>Petrobras had already said it planned to exercise its preferential rights for two of the four blocks. It was expected to partner with foreign explorers.</p>
      <p>If the rights to the four areas had been sold, it would have raised 106 billion reais, or more than US$26 billion.</p>
      <p>In the end, nearly 70 billion reais was bid.</p>
      <p>The windfall would be a boon to Bolsonaro's far-right government as it struggles to revive economic growth, reduce unemployment and pay down a crippling debt burden.</p>
      <p>Pre-salt deposits account for more than 60 per cent of Brazil's oil production.</p>
      <p>Environmental activists held a protest outside the luxury hotel in Rio where the auction was being held, demanding "ocean without oil."</p>
      <p>Describing the auction as "ridiculous," the 350.org action group said Brazilians "want a sea free of devastating oil spills and the greed of fossil fuel corporations."</p>
      <p>The sale comes as Brazil battles to contain a massive oil spill, which has affected hundreds of beaches along more than 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) of Atlantic coastline.</p>
