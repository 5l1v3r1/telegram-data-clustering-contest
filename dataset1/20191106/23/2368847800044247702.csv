英議會成立專門組織關注香港 擬制裁施暴者

06 Nov 2019, 23:53

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】日前英國議員們成立了一個全黨派議會團體，關注香港民主和人權，該團體主席表示，英國需要堅定立場，考慮制裁香港的長期施暴者。該團體的成立，標誌著英國準備跟隨美國，就香港問題對中共加大施壓。
11月5日，全黨派香港議會小組（APPG on HK）在英國議會舉行成立大會。該團體的宗旨是：「促進民主和法治，捍衞香港的人權，分享有關香港的信息，發展英國與香港人民之間的關係。」
全黨派議會團體（All-Party Parliamentary Group，APPG）是英國議會中的一種組織，由來自所有政黨的政治家組成。新成立的APPG on HK，由前綠黨領袖貝內特男爵夫人（Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle）和自由民主黨黨鞭、國會議員邁克爾（Alistair Carmichael）共同擔任主席，還有8名工黨、保守黨或中立議員擔任副主席。
貝內特男爵夫人表示：「我們必須與香港站在一起。鎮壓香港人權的流血事件已經發生了5個月，就在最近幾天，（香港）候選人遭到警察和親北京團體的暴力襲擊，英國需要堅定立場，考慮針對那些長期的施虐者實行制裁。」
APPG on HK副主席之一、英國人權活動家、上議院議員奧爾頓勛爵（Lord Alton of Liverpool）說，香港人民正合法的尋求《中英聯合聲明》承諾的普選權，APPG on HK要求英國外交大臣表現出國際領導才能，明確表明中共違反了《中英聯合聲明》，並為持有英國國民海外護照的人大聲疾呼，保障他們權益。
儘管《中英聯合聲明》是在聯合國登記的合法有效聲明，但中共外交部多次宣稱《中英聯合聲明》只是「歷史文件」。最近中共駐英大使館還給英國國會議員發信說，《中英聯合聲明》不屬於國家間的「協議」。
奧爾頓勛爵對此表示，中共不僅要恐嚇香港抗議者，而且還要恐嚇英國國會議員，APPG on HK將聯合各黨派和國際盟友一道抵抗霸凌。
由於英國臨近大選，議會將解散，所以APPG on HK決定在選舉期間以「香港議會之友」的名義獨立運作。
非政府組織「與香港站在一起」（stand with HK）也派出一組觀察員參加了APPG on HK的成立大會。該組織發言人說，全球47個國家舉行抗議，支持香港的民主抗爭，也希望英國政府能聽取這些呼籲，並考慮對中共當局施加一些具體壓力，以阻止香港繼續陷入暴力的威權主義，並確保香港實現自由公正的選舉。
在英國議會尋求制裁香港施暴者之前，美國議會已經推出包括《香港人權與民主法案》在內的多個涉香港法案，準備對迫害香港人權的中港官員以及黨媒記者等實施制裁。目前《香港人權與民主法案》已經在國會眾議院一致通過，但還沒有提交參議院表決。

The British Parliament set up a special organization to pay attention to Hong Kong

06 Nov 2019, 23:53

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Recently, British parliamentarians set up a whole-party parliamentary group to pay attention to Hong Kong's democracy and human rights. The chairman of the group said that Britain needs a firm stance and considers sanctions against long-term perpetrators in Hong Kong. The establishment of the group marks the United Kingdom's readiness to follow the United States and put pressure on the CCP on the Hong Kong issue.
On November 5th, the All-Party Hong Kong Parliamentary Group (APPG on HK) held an inaugural meeting in the British Parliament. The group's mission is to ""promote democracy and the rule of law, defend human rights in Hong Kong, share information about Hong Kong, and develop relations between the British and Hong Kong people.""
The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) is an organization in the British Parliament that is composed of politicians from all political parties. The newly formed APPG on HK, co-chaired by the former Green Party leader Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle and the Liberal Democrat Party Whip, Congressman Alistair Carmichael, and eight Labour Party and Conservative Party Or a neutral member of the legislature.
Barnett Bennett said: ""We must stand with Hong Kong. The bloodshed that has suppressed human rights in Hong Kong has been going on for five months. In recent days, candidates in Hong Kong have been violently attacked by police and pro-Beijing groups. The UK needs a firm stance to consider imposing sanctions on long-term abusers.""
Lord Alton of Liverpool, one of the vice-chairmen of APPG on HK, a British human rights activist and a member of the House of Lords, said that the people of Hong Kong are legitimately seeking universal suffrage from the Sino-British Joint Declaration. APPG on HK requires British diplomacy. The Minister showed international leadership and made it clear that the CCP violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration and screamed for those who hold British national passports to protect their rights.
Although the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a legal and valid statement registered with the United Nations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly declared that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is only a ""historical document."" Recently, the Chinese Embassy in the UK also sent a letter to the British parliamentarians saying that the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not belong to the ""agreement"" between countries.
Lord Alton said that the CCP should not only intimidate Hong Kong protesters, but also intimidate British parliamentarians. APPG on HK will unite all parties and international allies to resist bullying.
As the UK is approaching the general election, the parliament will be dissolved, so APPG on HK decided to operate independently as a ""Friend of the Hong Kong Parliament"" during the election period.
The NGO ""Standing with Hong Kong"" (stand with HK) also sent a group of observers to attend the inaugural meeting of APPG on HK. A spokesperson for the organization said that 47 countries around the world have protested and supported the democratic struggle in Hong Kong. They also hope that the British government can listen to these appeals and consider putting some specific pressure on the Chinese authorities to prevent Hong Kong from continuing to fall into violent authoritarianism and ensure Hong Kong achieves free and fair elections.
Before the British Parliament sought to sanction Hong Kong violent people, the US Congress has introduced a number of Hong Kong-related laws, including the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Democracy, to prepare sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials who persecute Hong Kong's human rights and party media reporters. At present, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on Human Rights and Democracy has been unanimously passed in the House of Representatives, but has not yet been submitted to the Senate for voting.
