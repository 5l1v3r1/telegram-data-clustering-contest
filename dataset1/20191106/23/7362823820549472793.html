      <p>Several people suffered minor injuries when the ceiling in a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">London</a> theater collapsed during a Wednesday performance of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arthur-miller-archive-going-to-university-of-texas-library">Arthur Miller</a>’s “Death of a Salesman."</p>
      <p>Police responded to the Piccadilly Theater in the city's West End area around 8 p.m. after part of the ceiling crashed down. More than 1,000 people evacuated the venue, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-50323329">BBC</a> reported.</p>

      <p>BBC journalist Iain Haddow was at the play and said the collapse happened 20 minutes into the show. He said water had been dripping, "which turned progressively into a stream."</p>
      <p>Actor Wendell Pierce -- known for his work in HBO's "The Wire," the 2014 film "Selma" and numerous other TV roles -- plays the main character of Willy Loman. He apologized to theatergoers outside.</p>

      <p>“I did not mean for it to go like this,” he said in a video posted to Twitter. "I would like to thank you all, for one, safely evacuating. We apologize and we're glad that no one's hurt."</p>
