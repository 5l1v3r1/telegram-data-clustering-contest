      <h2>Demi's eldest, Rumer Willis, said that she tried to act as an intermediary between Scout and Tallulah and their mum</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:34:13+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/demi-moore">Demi Moore's</a> eldest daughter has revealed how her younger sisters, Scout and Tallulah, didn't speak to their mum for three years amid her difficult marriage to Ashton Kutcher.</p>
      <p>Rumer, Demi's 31 year old daughter with Bruce Willis, described how she acted as an intermediary between her younger sisters and their mum.</p>
      <p>The resentment was put down to the attention Demi was paying her then husband Ashton Kutcher - they were also trying for a child together, but sadly ended in a miscarriage.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Jada Pinkett-Smith's Red Table Talk with her mum and Tallulah, Rumer said: "Scout and Tallulah had very different experiences than I had when we stopped talking to my mom - they didn't speak to her for three years."</p>

      <p>Rumer added: "[I] went in an out as kind of like the ambassador for the family."</p>
      <p>Tallulah chimed in: "So much of that time, especially with Ashton, I was so angry because I felt like something that was mine had been taken away."</p>
      <p>She continued that "when [Demi] wanted to have another baby and then it wasn't happening and there was so much focus on that, it was like, 'Oh, well, we're not enough.'"</p>
      <p>"At one point," Rumer said, "Her friends are calling me and being like, 'I'm really worried about your mom. You need to talk to her', so then I'm like, 'OK, well, I have to go and fix this.'"</p>
      <p>It wasn't that easy, though, as Rumer related how the family shunned her for her decision to talk to Demi.</p>

      <p>She continued: "And then I was like, 'Then I'll have no one; I'll have my mom who's like, not capable of being my mom right now and then the rest of the family is just not gonna speak to me anymore.'"</p>
      <p>Demi herself explained that she felt an "addiction" to Ashton.</p>
      <p>She said: "The addiction and the co-dependency, my addiction to Ashton, that was probably almost more devastating because it took me seriously away emotionally."</p>
      <p>Demi and Ashton were married for six years, with it drawing a great deal of attention because of their 15 year age gap.</p>
      <p>They tied the knot in 2005, five years after Demi and Bruce had called it quits.</p>
      <p>Ashton's now with Mila Kunis - incidentally, he was her first kiss during the filming of That 70s Show.</p>
