CGS-CIMB Research raises target price for Fraser & Neave to RM36
06 Nov 2019, 23:53 by theedgemarkets.com
KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): CGS-CIMB Retail Research has maintained its “Hold’ rating on Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N) at RM35.30 with a higher price of RM36 and said F&N targets to grow its Malaysia and Thailand domestic sales in FY20 through the launch of new innovative products and more effective marketing efforts.
In a note Nov 6, the research house said particularly for Malaysia, new product launches were held back in FY19 as F&N was focused on reformulating existing products (90% of beverages sold in Malaysia were below sugar excise duty threshold) to comply with the implementation of the sugar tax onSept 1.
“We lower our FY20-22F EPS estimates by 4.3-4.8% to mainly account for higher skim milk powder prices as well as higher capex assumptions.
“Our Hold call remains with a higher DCF-based target price of RM36 as we roll over our valuation base year to 2021.
“Upside/downside risks: sharp decline/rise in raw material prices and weak/stiff competition for its products,” it said.
