【鏡論】盧秀燕的緊箍咒
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鏡週刊, 陳毅偉
台中火力發電廠持續排放有毒廢水，多次遭台中市政府查獲，屢罰無效。9月底，台中市政府認定違規情節重大，揚言不排除勒令停機。對此，台電提出承諾，保證年底前徹底改善。市長盧秀燕長考1個月，上星期決定，網開一面，重罰台電6,000萬元，暫緩勒令停機。
台中火力發電廠肩負電源供應重責，戮力發電，填補反核後電力缺口。也因此，汙染大增，天上噴毒氣，地上流毒水，搞得中部地區黎民百姓心火大起。盧秀燕打敗林佳龍，入主台中市政府，與台中火力發電廠汙染，大有關係。當初，盧秀燕競選主力政見之一，就是消除發電廠汙染。
盧秀燕上任之後，也有自覺，對台中火力發電廠盯得頗緊。然而，到頭來，事有輕重緩急，幾項因素彼此擠壓角力，環保還是力遜一籌，壓不過供電，敗下陣來。台電汙染屢罰屢犯，如今，又吃了6,000萬元罰單，未知，到了年底，是否就真的弊絕風清？
在台灣，供電這檔事，是一道永遠無解的方程式。這方程式裡，包含有電量、電價、汙染、反核等元素，諸元素又相互推擠競鬥。若要供電充足、乾淨無汙、價格便宜，唯有核能發電。不過，核電廠安全、核廢料處理，成了死穴盲點，反核運動風起雲湧，蔚為一股沛然莫之能禦流行風潮，核能發電，已被判死刑。
剩下來，燃煤發電價格便宜、電量充足，卻又汙染嚴重，小老百姓都反汙染。燃氣發電，乾淨得多，卻是價格偏高，小老百姓不接受電價上漲，馬政府當年吃過這虧，現在大選前，蔡政府已經拍胸脯保證，短期內不漲電價。綠能發電，八字才見一撇，遠水難救近火。不要核電、不要汙染、不要漲價，無路可走，只好缺電，這結果，小老百姓更無法接受。
這無解方程式，誰碰到，誰頭痛，大羅金仙都解不開這死結。台中火力發電廠汙染，擠走林佳龍，抬出盧秀燕。現在，這問題成了盧秀燕緊箍咒，她也變不出新戲法，頭痛之餘，只好兩害相權取其輕，「供電」權值高於「防汙」，放了台電一馬。如此這般，只是暫時飲鴆止渴，往將來看，這無解電力方程式，勢必沒完沒了，持續糾纏盧秀燕。
電力問題，誰碰到，誰頭痛。君不見，韓國瑜提了「有條件恢復核四」之說，馬上惹翻新北市長侯友宜，所有國民黨縣市長，只有侯拒絕表態撐韓。民進黨政府也一樣，吃足電力政策苦頭，之前就曾在供電吃緊之際，讓原先停擺核能發電機組，恢復發電，頂住供電缺口。這無解方程式，在可見將來，也只能且戰且走，沒有齊全齊美結論。

[Mirror] Lu Xiuyan's spell
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Mirror Weekly, Chen Yiwei
The Taichung Thermal Power Plant continued to discharge toxic waste water and was repeatedly seized by the Taichung City Government. At the end of September, the Taichung City Government found that the violations were significant, and threatened not to rule out the shutdown. In this regard, Taipower made a commitment to ensure complete improvement before the end of the year. Mayor Lu Xiuyan took a long test for one month. Last week, she decided to open the net and severely punish Taipower for 60 million yuan to suspend the shutdown.
Taichung Thermal Power Plant shoulders the responsibility of power supply and power generation to fill the power gap after the anti-nuclear. As a result, the pollution has increased greatly, the poisonous gas in the sky, the poisonous water on the ground, and the people of the central region have become more popular. Lu Xiuyan defeated Lin Jialong and entered the Taichung City Government. It has a lot to do with the pollution of the Taichung Thermal Power Plant. At the beginning, one of Lu Xiuyan’s main political views was to eliminate pollution from power plants.
After Lu Xiuyan took office, he also consciously stared at the Taichung Thermal Power Plant. However, in the end, things are prioritized, and several factors squeeze each other out. The environmental protection is still inferior, and the power supply is not overwhelmed. Taiwan's electricity pollution has repeatedly been repeatedly punishable. Now, it has eaten a ticket of 60 million yuan. It is unknown. At the end of the year, is it really bad?
In Taiwan, the issue of power supply is an equation that will never be solved. This equation contains elements such as electricity, electricity, pollution, and antinuclear, and the elements push each other. To provide sufficient power, clean and pollution-free, and cheap, only nuclear power can generate electricity. However, the safety of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste have become blind spots in the dead spots. The anti-nuclear movements have been surging, and it has become a popular trend. Nuclear power generation has been sentenced to death.
For the rest, coal-fired power generation is cheap and has sufficient electricity, but it is polluted seriously, and the small people are anti-pollution. Gas power generation is much cleaner, but the price is too high. The small people do not accept the price increase. The Malaysian government had eaten this loss in the past. Before the election, the Cai government has already taken the guarantee to ensure that the price will not rise in the short term. Green energy can generate electricity, and the eight characters can only see one. Don't nuclear power, don't pollute, don't raise prices, have no way to go, and have to lack electricity. As a result, the small people are even more unacceptable.
This has no solution equation, whoever encounters, who has a headache, Da Luo Jinxian can not solve this knot. The Taichung Thermal Power Plant polluted Lin Jialong and carried Lu Xiuyan. Now, this problem has become a curse for Lu Xiuyan. She has not changed her new tricks. After a headache, she has to take the two evils to take the light. The power supply is higher than the ""anti-pollution"" and the Taipower is released. In this way, it is only temporary drinking and quenching thirst. Looking at it, this unsolvable power equation is bound to endless, and continues to entangle Lu Xiuyan.
Power problems, who met, who had a headache. If you don't see it, South Korea's Yu said that ""conditional recovery of the nuclear four"" immediately provoked the Mayor of New North, Hou Youyi, and all the mayors of the Kuomintang County, only Hou refused to express their support. The DPP government is also the same. It has suffered from the power policy. Before the power supply was tight, the original nuclear power generators were shut down, power generation was restored, and the power supply gap was withstood. There is no solution equation. In the foreseeable future, it can only be fought and gone. There is no complete conclusion.
