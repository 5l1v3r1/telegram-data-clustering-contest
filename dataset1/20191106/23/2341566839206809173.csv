中國干涉學術界 英國會報告：論文提台灣被沒收
06 Nov 2019, 23:06 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, 中央通訊社
（中央社記者戴雅真倫敦6日專電）英國國會外交事務委員會發布報告示警，中國政府已經把干涉之手深入英國大學校園，試圖控制批評中國的言論，更施壓校方限制學術自由。
外交事務委員會5日發布的「在專制時代捍衛民主」（Defending Democracy in an Age of Autocracies）報告當中，議員表示，有「令人擔憂的」證據顯示中國干預校園，議員尤其憂心，中國學生的學費和其他投資，不應該凌駕於學術自由之上。
「泰晤士報」報導，中國籍學生近幾年迅速增加，目前是外籍學生當中的最大宗，每人每年付出學費上看4萬英鎊（約新台幣156萬元）。除了中國籍學生貢獻學費之外，英國大學和中國機構也有越來越多交流。
分析英國大學生的組成發現，在2017/18學年度，英國大學有10萬6530名中國籍學生，在過去10年內成長了2倍多。
報告特別點出，倫敦政經學院（LSE）上個月因為憂心學術自由遭到干預，把一門中國課程臨時喊卡。那門課程由親北京政府的上海投資人李世默資助。李世默曾多次公開讚揚中國國家主席習近平，甚至護航天安門事件。LSE經過內部研議後，決定把課程擱置。
報告也指出「星期泰晤士報」的報導，表示在中國有分校的諾丁罕大學（University of Nottingham）曾經在中國官員抗議下，取消在中國和英國校園舉行的西藏及台灣相關活動。
報告表示，部分經費來自中國政府的「全英中國學生學者聯誼會」（Chinese Students and Scholars Association），就是中國政府用以干涉的工具。
「他們聲稱目標是照顧中國籍學生，但他們也會回報中國大使館和中國當局，試圖阻擋有關中國的敏感議題被討論，並在中國大使館的指揮下，採取更多直接行動。」
報告發現中國干預的證據包括，有一間羅素大學集團（Russell Group university）旗下的大學，副校長在接到中國大使館的聯絡後，取消了一名講者的演講行程。
另有一名不具名副校長遭到中國大使館施壓，要求校內一名資深學者在某段時間內不要發表有關中國的政治性評論。此外，孔子學院（Confucius Institute）的官員，也曾在一場學術會議上沒收提到台灣的論文。
議員在報告中指控，各大學根本沒有體認到，越來越仰賴中國金援，對於學術自由可能會帶來的危險。
報告指出，英國外交部並沒有針對這種情況可能對學術造成的潛在威脅給予建議，呼籲政府單位和各大學在一年內研議出因應策略，並去探究這些收入是否會破壞英國的學術自由。（編輯：陳永昌）1081106
英國會報告：中國影響力滲入英國大學校園
（中央社香港6日綜合外電報導）英國國會議員警告，他們掌握「令人擔憂的證據」顯示中國影響力滲入英國大學校園，與中國建立合作關係的英國機構學術自由岌岌可危，甚至有孔子學院相關官員沒收提及台灣論文。
美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）報導，英國是最新一個針對中國當局可能干預教育體系而發出示警的國家。多年來英國各大學一直積極招收中國學生，他們繳付的學費遠高於英國或歐洲學生。
英國下議院外交事務委員會在本週公布的報告指出：「儘管目前仍有超過10萬名中國留學生在英國深造，但相較澳洲、紐西蘭和美國，（在英國）中國影響力的問題甚少受到關注。」
根據最近公布的一項研究調查，英國是最受中國學生歡迎的留學地點之一，與美國、澳洲及加拿大並列，包括利物浦大學（Liverpool University）及諾丁罕大學（Nottingham University）在內的多所英國大學，已與中國大專院校建立合作或其他更緊密關係。
英國下議院的報告指出，這些包含經濟和學術兩方面的合作關係，以及中國學生帶來龐大可觀的利益，使得英國各大學容易受到來自中國政府的壓力。
這份報告提到，英國倫敦政經學院（London School of Economics）教授胡克禮（Christopher Hughes）曾告訴國會議員：「你們底線在哪裡？當北京官署負責人現身葡萄牙的會議，不僅沒收論文與書冊，還撕掉所有提及台灣的論文頁面不讓學者閱覽它們？」
胡克禮還說：「我們說這是不可接受的影響與干涉嗎？我們是否會開始說或許這些組織不應出現在我們校園裡？或許他們的議程不符合我們價值觀？」
他也指出，孔子學院存在英國校園內，就是北京當局施加微妙壓力的案例，這可能對更廣泛的學術自由問題產生影響。
胡克禮表示：「我們都聽過幾個以大寫英文字母T開頭的地名，像是台灣、西藏與天安門，如今還有香港。由於學者必須跟孔子學院合作，讓孔子學院本身具備了正當性，因此這些議題就遭邊緣化且被排擠。」
不僅是英國擔憂中國可能對校園造成影響，紐西蘭和澳洲的學者也警告，特別是中國外交官的干涉，以及為了保護中國學生學費而自我審查，都可能對學術自由構成威脅。（譯者：曹宇帆/核稿：陳彥鈞）1081106

China interferes with academia, the British Council reports: the paper mentions that Taiwan was confiscated
06 Nov 2019, 23:06 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Dai Yazhen, London, 6th) The British Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament issued a report warning that the Chinese government has stepped into the British university campus to try to control criticism of China, and pressure the school to limit academic freedom.
In the ""Defending Democracy in an Age of Autocracies"" report released by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 5th, Members said that there are ""worrying"" evidence that China intervenes in the campus. Members are particularly worried about the tuition fees of Chinese students. And other investments should not be above academic freedom.
The Times reported that Chinese students have increased rapidly in recent years and are currently the largest among foreign students. Each year they pay a tuition fee of 40,000 pounds (about NT$1.56 million). In addition to Chinese students contributing tuition fees, there are more and more exchanges between UK universities and Chinese institutions.
Analysis of the composition of British university students found that in the 2017/18 academic year, there were 100,650 Chinese students in British universities, which have more than doubled in the past 10 years.
The report specifically pointed out that the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was intervened last month for worrying about academic freedom and temporarily shouted a Chinese course. The course was funded by Li Shimo, a Shanghai investor who was pro-Beijing. Li Shimo has repeatedly publicly praised Chinese President Xi Jinping and even defended the space security incident. After an internal discussion, LSE decided to put the course on hold.
The report also pointed out that the ""Weekly Times"" reported that the University of Nottingham, which has a branch campus in China, had cancelled Tibet and Taiwan-related activities on Chinese and British campuses under the protest of Chinese officials.
According to the report, part of the funding comes from the Chinese government's ""Chinese Students and Scholars Association"", which is a tool used by the Chinese government to interfere.
""They claim that the goal is to take care of Chinese students, but they will also return to the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese authorities, trying to stop sensitive issues related to China from being discussed and taking more direct action under the command of the Chinese Embassy.""
The report found evidence of Chinese intervention, including a university under the Russell Group university, and the vice-president canceled a speaker's speech after receiving a contact with the Chinese embassy.
Another unnamed vice-president was pressured by the Chinese Embassy to ask a senior scholar in the school not to post political comments about China for a certain period of time. In addition, officials of the Confucius Institute also confiscated Taiwanese papers at an academic conference.
In the report, the lawmakers accused the universities of not recognizing that they are increasingly relying on China’s financial aid for the dangers that academic freedom may bring.
The report pointed out that the British Foreign Ministry did not give advice on the potential threats to the situation caused by this situation, and called on government units and universities to study the response strategy within one year and to explore whether these incomes would undermine British academic freedom. .

UK report: Chinese influence penetrates UK university campus
(Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th, comprehensive foreign news report) British parliamentarians warned that they have ""worry evidence"" to show that China's influence has infiltrated the UK university campus, and the academic freedom of British institutions that have established cooperative relations with China is at stake, even with relevant officials of Confucius Institutes. Confiscation mentions Taiwanese papers.
CNN reported that the UK is the latest country to issue warnings against Chinese authorities' possible intervention in the education system. Over the years, universities in the UK have been actively recruiting Chinese students, and their tuition fees are much higher than those of British or European students.
The report of the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee this week stated: ""Although there are still more than 100,000 Chinese students studying in the UK, the impact of China's influence is even higher than that of Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Less attention.""
According to a recently published study, the UK is one of the most popular places for Chinese students to study, alongside the United States, Australia and Canada, including Liverpool University and Nottingham University. The UK universities have established cooperation or other closer relationships with Chinese universities and colleges.
The British House of Commons report pointed out that these economic and academic cooperation, as well as the enormous benefits of Chinese students, make the UK universities vulnerable to pressure from the Chinese government.
The report mentions that Christopher Hughes, a professor at London's London School of Economics, told Congress: ""Where is your bottom line? When the head of the Beijing government office appeared in Portugal, not only did the papers and books be confiscated, Also tearing off all the paper pages that mention Taiwan and not letting scholars read them?""
Hu Keli also said: ""Do we say this is unacceptable influence and interference? Will we start to say that perhaps these organizations should not appear on our campus? Perhaps their agenda is not in line with our values?""
He also pointed out that the existence of the Confucius Institute on the British campus is a case of subtle pressure from the Beijing authorities, which may have an impact on the broader issue of academic freedom.
Hu Keli said: ""We have heard a few names starting with the capital letter T, such as Taiwan, Tibet and Tiananmen, and now Hong Kong. Because scholars must cooperate with the Confucius Institute, the Confucius Institute itself has legitimacy, so These issues are marginalized and crowded out.""
Not only is Britain worried that China may have an impact on the campus, but scholars in New Zealand and Australia have also warned that especially the interference of Chinese diplomats and self-censorship to protect Chinese students' tuition fees may pose a threat to academic freedom.
