【專訪】【金馬56】隔螢幕都能感受快爆炸的怒　原騰放手一搏入圍了
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 熊景玉, 陳仁萱
請原騰詳細地介紹一下自己，他的自我介紹內容是「我是原騰，來自馬來西亞，今年25歲。」就這樣，沒別的了。
原騰說他是個慢熱的人，但看他在電影《樂園》裡的表現，隔著大銀幕都能感受到他那種一碰就會爆炸的怒氣。這種反差似乎總出現在原騰的人生中，他試鏡不停失敗死心當幕後，卻又無心插柳真正當了演員；小時候因為外型被言語霸凌，長大後成了帥氣的藝人。儘管華人在馬來西亞當演員很難生存，但原騰還是想放手一搏，「很想有朝一日能跟劉青雲演對手戲！」


原騰曾經歷經多次試鏡被打槍，原本想專心當攝影師，最後不抱期望卻試鏡成功，終於當上演員。

金馬獎新演員入圍名單中，原騰是個比其他人更陌生的名字。在電影《樂園》中，他的角色「鼠仔」是個染上毒癮的勒戒少年，張狂外放、不可一世，卻有個不堪的家庭。原騰的演出眼神時而凶狠、時而脆弱，不像是一個演戲經驗並不算多的新人，甚至憑該片獲得第22屆上海國際電影節亞洲新人獎最佳男演員。
原騰原名翁原騰，他的演員之路既帶著崎嶇又很戲劇化，小時候他「很愛演」，曾立下想當演員志向，後來他考上廣電科系轉做幕後，有段時間很積極去casting，卻往往失望而回。
「就在我打算放棄，朝著當上『馬來西亞最年輕攝影師』目標前進時，有個角色來找我試鏡。」原騰說，那個角色要會音樂、要有才藝，還是高中生，他心想沒有一個條件符合，怎麼可能中？原騰已有工作為由推掉試鏡，但對方鍥而不捨，幫他喬了2次時間，他抱著「來玩」的心情，不照劇本走，對白也忘了，打扮又頹廢，沒想到選角指導認為他「敢放敢玩、可塑性高」，讓他演了一個配角，就這樣原騰又兜回演員之路。
在馬來西亞當演員，尤其又是華語演員，出頭實在不易。原騰說現在馬來西亞的中文電視台被砍到只剩一間，一年只拍1、2部電視劇，華人不管從事幕前或幕後，出路都十分狹窄。「我當初的想法很簡單，只是想在職業欄填上『演員』2個字。」


儘管在馬來西亞當演員生存不易，原騰仍然選擇當演員這條路，並再給自己5年時間在演藝圈闖蕩。

從小看港片、港劇長大，原騰在劉青雲等港星的薰陶下，明知在馬來西亞走演藝路生存不易，依然一頭栽進來。經紀公司問他想不想簽約繼續合作，「我只考慮了一天就簽下去了。」他打算再給自己5年，到30歲時再看看發展如何，「但目前還沒有一些比較肯定的戲約找上門，先把《樂園》和金馬的宣傳跑完再說。」
父親剛去世的那段時間，是原騰的人生低潮期，「我那時還沒找到工作，學校也停學了，每天一個人在家，看著爸爸的照片，聽到錄音機播的阿彌陀佛佛號，我覺得家裡好安靜，好恐怖，整個人無所適從。」不想悶在家裡，本來就學過跆拳道的原騰於是報名學泰拳，「打泰拳很好舒壓，每天聽到打沙包的聲音，至少你暫時不會看見原本藏在心裡的恐懼感。」


原騰藉打泰拳度過人生低潮期，算有功夫底子的他，對於接拍動作戲也頗有信心。（翻攝自原騰IG）

打泰拳支撐原騰度過將近7、8個月的低潮期，到如今也練了2年多。問他身手如何？能不能一個打10個？原騰笑說：「打普通人還可以，厲害點的就不行了！」

[Interview] [Golden Horse 56] I can feel the blast of the explosion from the screen.
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Xiong Jingyu, Chen Renxuan
I would like to introduce myself in detail. His self-introduction is ""I am Yuan Teng, from Malaysia, I am 25 years old."" In this way, nothing else.
Yuan Teng said that he is a slow-moving person, but watching his performance in the movie ""Paradise"", he can feel the anger of his explosion when he touches the big screen. This contrast seems to always appear in the life of the original Teng, he tried to stop after the scene, but he did not mind to be a real actor; when he was a child, he was bullied by his appearance and became a handsome artist when he grew up. Although the Chinese are difficult to survive as actors in Malaysia, Yuan Teng still wants to let go, ""I really want to play against Liu Qingyun one day!""


Original Teng has experienced many times when he was shot and tried to concentrate on being a photographer. In the end, he did not expect but tried to succeed, and finally became an actor.



Earlier, Yuan Teng had won the Best Actor of the Asian Newcomer Award at the 22nd Shanghai International Film Festival with Paradise. (Reflected from the original Teng IG)

In the finalists of the Golden Horse Awards, the original actor is a stranger name than others. In the movie ""Paradise"", his character ""rat"" is a young boy who is addicted to drug addiction. He is arrogant and unpredictable, but has an unbearable family. Original Teng’s performance eyes are sometimes fierce and sometimes fragile. It’s not like a newcomer with less experience in acting, or even the best actor in the Asian Newcomer Award at the 22nd Shanghai International Film Festival.
The original Tengyuan famous Weng Yuanteng, his actor's road is both rugged and dramatic. When he was a child, he ""liked to play"". He once wanted to be an actor, and later he went to the radio and television department and turned to the scene. Actively go to casting, but often disappointed and back.
""When I was going to give up and move toward the goal of being the youngest photographer in Malaysia, I had a role to look for me to audition."" Yuan Teng said that the character must have music, talent, or high school. He I wonder if there is no one condition, how can it be? Yuan Teng had already pushed the audition because of the work, but the other side persevered and helped him to Joe for 2 times. He held the mood of ""coming to play"". He did not follow the script, and the dialogue was forgotten. The dress was decadent and he did not expect to choose. The corner guide thinks that he ""dare to dare to play, high plasticity"", let him play a supporting role, so that the original Teng and back to the actor's road.
Being an actor in Malaysia, especially a Chinese actor, is not easy. Yuan Teng said that Malaysia’s Chinese TV station has been cut down to only one, and only one or two TV dramas are filmed a year. The Chinese are very narrow in their way of being in front of or behind the scenes. ""My original idea was very simple. I just wanted to fill in the ""actor"" in the occupation column.""


Although it is not easy to survive as an actor in Malaysia, Yuan Teng still chooses to be an actor and gives himself five years to play in the entertainment industry.

From a young age, Hong Kong films and Hong Kong dramas grew up. Originally, under the scent of Hong Kong stars such as Liu Qingyun, I know that it is not easy to survive in Malaysia and still grow in. The brokerage company asked him if he wanted to sign a contract and continued to cooperate. ""I only considered it for one day."" He plans to give himself another five years. When he is 30, he will look at how it will develop. ""But there are no more positive games. About to find the door, let's finish the propaganda of ""Paradise"" and Golden Horse.""
During the time when my father died, it was the low tide of Yuan Teng’s life. ""I didn't find a job at that time. The school also stopped school. Every day at home, watching my father's photo, I heard the Amitabha Buddha on the tape recorder. I feel at home. It’s so quiet, so horrible, the whole person is at a loss.” I don’t want to be bored at home. I used to learn Taekwondo’s original Tengquan to sign up for Thai boxing. “It’s very good to play Muay Thai. Every day I hear the sound of playing sandbags. At least you won’t see the original. The fear that is hidden in my heart.""


Yuan Teng borrowed Thai fist to spend the low tide of life, and he has a kung fu, and he is quite confident in taking action. (Reflected from the original Teng IG)

Playing Muay Thai supported the original low tide of nearly 7 or 8 months, and now it has been practiced for more than 2 years. How is his skill? Can you play 10 for one? Yuan Tengxiao said: ""It’s okay to play ordinary people. It’s not good enough!""
