06 Nov 2019, 23:14 by Jordan Crucchiola



If you want to see a sci-fi horror movie that feels like Annihilation meets Mandy, then you’ve got a feast ahead of you with Color Out of Space. Writer and director Richard Stanley adapted the story by H.P. Lovecraft, and it is a hypnotic explosion of bright colors and escalating body horror. Nicolas Cage stars as Nathan Gardner opposite Joely Richardson as his wife. Together, they have three kids, a gorgeous house in the woods, a pack of llamas, and shortly after we meet them in the movie, they also have a glowing space rock in their yard that brings inexplicable havoc into their lives. Cage gives a glorious Rage Cage performance as life in the forest gets more and more out of hand, and you can see it for yourself in theaters starting January 24.
