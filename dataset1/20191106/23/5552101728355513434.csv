【鏡評】金融市場震盪　更低且更久
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鏡週刊, 吳貞慧
美國聯準會在上週完成今年第三次降息，不過，發布的官方決策聲明裡，刪除了前幾次聲明必載的「將採取適當行動、延續經濟擴張」的措辭，代表著美國聯準會「預防式降息」的行動已經結束了。也就是說，原本美中貿易戰失控、英國脫歐談判失敗等超級風險、本欄之前所擔心的《十月中旬的決戰時刻》，核彈引爆的引信已經拆除，央行政策回歸正常。
那麼，甚麼是「回歸正常」呢？國際貨幣基金（IMF）剛剛發布的《全球金融穩定報告》用了「更低且更久」（Lower for Longer）作標題，描述未來很長一段時間，包括經濟成長率、貿易動能、利率等經濟脈動，都會陷入動能持續降低、時間拖得很長、風險卻驟然升高的新常態。
IMF「更低且更久」的描述迅速引爆熱烈討論，尋找面對新常態的對策。世貿組織（WTO）在今年4月原本預估2019年全球貿易額增長2.6％，但是10月最新的預估則砍半剩下1.2％。WTO這樣對半砍的手筆前所未見，因為全球1年的貿易額大約是25兆美元，少了1.4％，代表著一刀砍掉3,500億美元的貿易額，相當於台灣1年GDP的6成、或是台積電10年的營業收入就此人間蒸發，相當可怕。
當然「更低且更久」存在正面的機會，如今「負利率理財」躍升為財經媒體最熱門的關鍵字，既然利率低到零、而且會維持很長的時間，那麼把錢放在銀行定存就愚蠢至極，應該拿來買高收益債券基金、或是美股台股的ETF、稍有經驗的投資人則直接買進台積電等有穩定股息的績優股，這些簡單、容易操作的負利率理財術，只要及早動手，到處都是機會。
例如過去一季台積電股票從250元漲到逼近300元，就是負利率理財的範本，本土與外資投資人不只賺到年息3％的股息，還奉送20％的資本利得，台灣股市的股息殖利率，在全球市場中名列前茅，對全世界的負利率資金有高度的吸引力。
更低且更久的背面，則是「風險更高」。超低的利率、長期的低成長率，會迫使金融機構以及企業大量舉債，才能維持基本的獲利，IMF的《全球融穩定報告》針對29個有能力引爆金融海嘯的經貿大國，做國家、金融業、與龍頭企業的風險測試，發現各國舉債都增加、風險全面上揚、而且非金融機構的負債更超過當年金融海嘯的水準。風險最高的國家，排名第一是西班牙，第二名是中國。
更低且更久的新常態，會強迫政府與企業大量舉債、追逐風險性資產，必然導致實體經濟與金融市場的劇烈震盪，台積電投資人過去3個月賺到23％，獲得定存20倍的回報，是為了將來可能發生的風險做準備，這就是「更低且更久」的真諦。

[Mirror Review] Financial market volatility Lower and longer
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Mirror Weekly, Wu Yuhui
The US Federal Reserve completed the third rate cut this year last week. However, in the official decision statement issued, the words ""will take appropriate action and extend economic expansion"", which must be contained in the previous statements, are deleted, representing the United States. The action of ""preventive rate cuts"" is over. That is to say, the super-risk of the US-China trade war, the failure of the Brexit negotiations, and the ""Decisive Moment of the Mid-October"" that were worried before this column, the fuses detonated by the nuclear bomb have been dismantled, and the central bank policy has returned to normal.
So, what is ""returning to normal""? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) just released the ""Global Financial Stability Report"" with the title ""Lower for Longer"", describing the economy for a long time, including economic growth rate, trade momentum, interest rates, etc. Pulsation will fall into a new normality in which kinetic energy continues to decrease, time drags on, and risk suddenly rises.
The description of the IMF ""lower and longer"" quickly ignited a heated discussion to find a way to face the new normal. The World Trade Organization (WTO) originally estimated that global trade volume will increase by 2.6% in 2019 in April this year, but the latest estimate for October is halved by 1.2%. The WTO’s semi-cutting has never been seen before, because the global trade volume of one year is about 25 trillion US dollars, which is 1.4% less. It represents a trade cut of 350 billion US dollars, equivalent to 6 years of Taiwan’s 1 year GDP. Cheng, or TSMC’s 10 years of operating income has evaporated from the world, which is quite scary.
Of course, there is a positive opportunity for ""lower and longer"". Nowadays, ""negative interest rate management"" has become the hottest keyword in the financial media. Since the interest rate is as low as zero and will last for a long time, then the money will be deposited in the bank. It’s stupid, ETFs that should be used to buy high-yield bond funds, or US stocks, and slightly experienced investors to buy straight-for-money stocks with stable dividends, such as TSMC. These simple, easy-to-operate negative-interest financial instruments, as long as Work early and there are opportunities everywhere.
For example, in the past quarter, TSMC’s stock rose from 250 yuan to nearly 300 yuan, which is a model for negative interest rate management. Local and foreign investors not only earned a dividend of 3% per annum, but also offered 20% of capital gains, and the dividend yield of Taiwan’s stock market. It is among the best in the global market and is highly attractive to negative interest rates around the world.
The lower and longer back is ""higher risk."" Ultra-low interest rates and long-term low growth rates will force financial institutions and enterprises to borrow heavily in order to maintain basic profits. The IMF's Global Stability Report targets 29 economic and trade powers capable of detonating the financial tsunami. The risk test of the financial industry and leading enterprises found that all countries' debts increased, their risks increased, and the liabilities of non-financial institutions exceeded the level of the financial tsunami that year. The country with the highest risk is Spain, and the second is China.
The lower and longer new normal will force the government and enterprises to borrow heavily and chase risky assets, which will inevitably lead to a sharp shock in the real economy and financial markets. TSMC investors have earned 23% in the past three months and obtained a deposit of 20 times. The reward is to prepare for the risks that may occur in the future. This is the essence of ""lower and longer"".
