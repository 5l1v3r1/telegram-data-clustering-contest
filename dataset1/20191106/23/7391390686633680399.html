      <p>Never say never, Bravo fans, especially when it comes to whether or not <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-camille-grammer-return-to-the-rhobh-season-9-reunion-she-stole-the-show-18228303">Camille Grammer will return to <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i></a><i>. </i>On Tuesday, Nov. 5, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealCamilleG/status/1191978813883912194">Camille hinted at her <i>Housewives</i> homecoming</a> when she tweeted, “I’m getting back in the game. diamonds and drama. #rhobh.” The <a href="https://www.etonline.com/denise-richards-confirms-rhobh-is-filming-moving-forward-with-potential-new-castmates-exclusive">10th season of <i>RHOBH</i> has been filming</a> since August, so it stands to reason that the series veteran will not be around for the entire season, but will make at least one cameo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-camille-from-rhobh-has-changed-from-her-first-season-on-the-show-to-now-8458823">Camille has been a fixture of <i>RHOBH</i></a> since the beginning— well, almost. With the exception of Season 4, she has been either a main cast member or a Friend Of on every season. By the end of Season 9, she was at odds with almost everyone on the main roster. And then, Camille’s remaining ally on the show, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/lisa-vanderpump-confirmed-her-rhobh-exit-opened-up-about-why-shes-leaving-17987744">Lisa Vanderpump, exited the series in June</a>, and the rest of the Season 9 cast, AKA the group of people who drove her to walk off the set in the middle of a reunion taping, was reportedly brought back for Season 10. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-camille-grammer-return-to-the-rhobh-season-9-reunion-she-stole-the-show-18228303">Camille eventually returned to the reunion</a>, but her role as a "Friend Of" on Season 10 no longer felt like a given without LVP around.</p>

      <p>In August, Camille confirmed in a series of since-deleted tweets that she would not be on the upcoming season. Per <i>People</i>, she tweeted, "<a href="https://people.com/tv/camille-grammer-not-asked-back-rhobh-blames-kyle-richards/">I wasn't asked back.</a> It's fine. I did my time on the show. And it’s Kyles show.” In a follow-up tweet, she explained, "It was was up to Kyle. I’m really fine. After the reunion, I didn’t want to come back. It was an awful experience.” Evidently, she was asked back after all.</p>

      <p>Ahead of Camille's announcement on Monday, there were rumblings about the <a href="https://www.allabouttrh.com/2019/10/24/rhobh-season-10-has-essentially-no-drama-without-lisa-vanderpump-plus-sources-say-the-cast-is-all-getting-along/">Season 10 cast maybe getting along too well </a>for a reality TV show that tries to deliver drama. In October, a source claimed to HollywoodLife that Season 10 has seen "<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/21/rhobh-first-season-without-lisa-vanderpump-no-drama-fights-filming/">no drama at all with Lisa Vanderpump’s departure</a>," and that the returning cast members plus newcomers Garcelle Beauvais and Sutton Stracke <b>"</b>are all truly friends and [are] getting along, seemingly."</p>

      <p>Bravo's no stranger to a wildcard showing up to shake things up when a season has taken a turn for the chill (see: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-ashley-jacobs-be-at-the-southern-charm-reunion-shes-done-enough-damage-18687741">Ashley Davis's appearences on <i>Southern Charm</i> Season 6</a>), and it looks like Camille's expert level pot-stirring will be back for another round. Remember, this is the person who accused Dorit Kemsley and Paul "PK" Kemsley of owing someone she knows a lot of money, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/camille-denise-richards-reactions-to-the-woolsey-fires-on-rhobh-could-not-be-any-more-different-18146024">made a dig at Denise Richards's rented home</a> after they both had to evacuate during the Woosley Fires, and claimed Teddi Mellencamp-Arroyave gave her daughter the cold shoulder at the airport after her wedding all in the same season.</p>
