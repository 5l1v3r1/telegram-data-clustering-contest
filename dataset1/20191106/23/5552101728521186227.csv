【鏡觀】總統大選沒有垃圾時間
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by 鏡週刊, 楊子磊
參加2020年總統選舉連署的期限，上週六截止，提出申請的8組連署人，僅一組交件，但未達門檻，因此確定除了代表民進黨的蔡英文，及國民黨的韓國瑜之外，頂多再有親民黨推薦的候選人參與角逐。由於最近2個多月來的民調結果非常穩定，民間因此流傳總統大選進入「垃圾時間」之說，意即大勢底定，但韓粉顯然並不服氣，英迷則深恐去年高雄變天的憾事重演，陷入焦慮者大有人在。
這次藉著連署程序意圖取得總統候選人資格的8組人馬中，最受矚目的當屬曾在陳水扁執政時期擔任副總統的呂秀蓮。她代表號稱是台獨死硬派的喜樂島聯盟，一路針對蔡英文的施政作為猛烈批評，如果連署過關，勢必吸引部分傳統、因小英未給予「關愛眼神」而懷怨的深綠票源。只是呂秀蓮的訴求並沒引起共鳴，報載收到連署書未及14萬份，不到門檻所需數量的一半。呂秀蓮無法出戰，對蔡英文的選情當有助益。
至於擁有總統參選門票的親民黨，至今只宣示「絕不缺席」的態度，一直未確定代表人選，但一般預料高齡77歲的的宋楚瑜，將會四度掛帥出戰。一方面，宋個人是「老驥伏櫪、壯心不已」，另方面則是親民黨為了保住立法院不分區席次，需要母雞帶頭。宋楚瑜參選難有勝出可能，卻會對藍綠兩邊選情造成影響，只是對哪一方較為有利，各種民調未有定論；較合乎邏輯的推論是，對韓國瑜看不上眼的深藍選民，找到一個可以轉投的對象，因此對蔡英文相對有利。
韓國瑜從去年當選高雄市長，到今年贏得國民黨黨內初選，開始代表百年政黨展開活動，他的一言一行，都顛覆了國人對這個老黨的刻板印象。他懂得運用淺顯易懂的語言，講出庶民百姓的心聲，但同時又口無遮攔，連街頭巷尾流傳的粗鄙「幹話」，都毫不忌諱地拿出來說嘴；除此之外，他也不斷提出一些政策主張，卻又在遭受批評後立刻自我修正。這些迥異國民黨傳統政治人物的表現，被解讀是競選策略的運用，目的在創造輿論聲量，只是選民對國家領導人要求的標準畢竟不同，韓國瑜上週的民調雖稍回升，惟若無讓人信賴的作為，只靠老招就要翻轉頹勢，並不容易。
蔡英文爭取連任，目前聲勢所以領先，在於對外取得美國空前支持，面對中國不卑不亢，站穩維護主權立場，內政方面則是經濟成長表現優於競爭國家，股市持續創29年來新高，同時過去3年多來推動的改革，經過大力宣導，也讓多數民眾有感。不過，鑒於去年高雄市長選舉結果的變化，不僅各種「辣台妹」的後援組織一再散播憂患意識，民進黨上下也是戒慎恐懼，只怕歷史重演。至於中國透過散布假訊息介入大選的因素，連美國都表示關切，國安單位更不敢漠視。
總統大選尚餘六十多天就要投票，各種影響選舉結果的變數隨時出現，競爭對手彼此都不敢大意，自然沒有可能心存「垃圾時間」而鬆懈。雙方決勝關鍵，還在如何激發潛在支持者的熱情，踴躍出席投票。

[Mirror] There is no garbage time in the presidential election
06 Nov 2019, 23:58 by Mirror Weekly, Yang Zilei
The deadline for participating in the 2020 presidential election was last Saturday. The eight groups of applicants who applied for the application were only handed over, but they did not reach the threshold. Therefore, in addition to Tsai Ing-wen, who represents the DPP, and the Korean Yu, the Kuomintang. In addition, at most, there are candidates recommended by the People First Party to participate in the competition. Since the results of the polls in the past two months have been very stable, the people have therefore circulated the presidential election to enter the ""junk time"", which means that the general trend is fixed, but the Korean powder is obviously not convinced, and the British fans are afraid that Kaohsiung will change last year. The resentment of the resurgence, there are many people who are caught in anxiety.
Among the eight groups of people who attempted to obtain the presidential candidacy through the program, the most eye-catching was Lu Xiulian, who served as vice president during Chen Shui-bian’s reign. She represents the island of Joy Island, which is known as the Taiwanese hardliner. It has been fiercely criticized for Tsai Ing-wen's administration. If it passes through the customs, it will inevitably attract some traditional and deep-green votes that Xiaoying has not given to ""care for the eyes"". However, Annette Lu’s appeal did not resonate. The report received less than 140,000 copies of the book, less than half of the required number of thresholds. Annette Lu could not play, and it would be helpful for Tsai Ing-wen's election.
As for the People First Party, which has tickets for the presidential election, it has only declared that it is ""not absent"". It has not been determined to represent the candidates. However, it is generally expected that James Soo, aged 77, will be in the forefront. On the one hand, Song personally is ""old and sturdy, and has a strong heart"". On the other hand, the People First Party needs the hen to take the lead in order to keep the Legislative Yuan without a seat. It is difficult for Song Chuyu to win the election, but it will affect the election of the blue and green sides. It is only beneficial to which side, and the various polls have not been finalized. The more logical inference is that the dark blue voters who are not eye-catching to South Korea’s Yu Find a target that can be transferred, so it is relatively beneficial to Tsai Ing-wen.
South Korea Yu was elected as the mayor of Kaohsiung last year. He won the Kuomintang party primary election this year and began to represent the centuries-old political party. His words and deeds have subverted the stereotype of the old party. He knows how to use the easy-to-understand language to tell the voices of the people, but at the same time, there is no cover, and even the rough ""talking words"" circulating in the streets and lanes are unscrupulously come out to talk about the mouth; in addition, he also Constantly put forward some policy ideas, but they immediately corrected themselves after being criticized. The performance of these traditional Kuomintang traditional politicians is interpreted as the use of campaign strategies. The purpose is to create a public opinion volume. However, the standards required by voters for state leaders are different. The Korean pop polls last week have rebounded slightly, but none. It’s not easy to flip the trend with the old tricks.
Tsai Ing-wen seeks re-election. At present, the momentum is so advanced. It is to obtain unprecedented support from the United States. In the face of China’s unhappiness and stability, it maintains a sovereign position. In terms of internal affairs, economic growth is better than that of competing countries. The stock market continues to hit a new high in 29 years. The reforms promoted over the years have also made the majority of the people feel after vigorous publicity. However, in view of the changes in the election results of the Kaohsiung Mayor last year, not only the support organizations of various ""Spicy Taiwanese Girls"" have repeatedly spread their sense of urgency, but the DPP is also cautious and fearful, and fears that history will repeat itself. As for China's involvement in the general election through the dissemination of false information, even the United States has expressed concern that the national security units are even less willing to ignore.
There will be more than 60 days of voting in the presidential election. Various variables affecting the election results will appear at any time. Competitors will not dare to care about each other. Naturally, there is no possibility of lax in ""junk time."" The key to the success of both sides is how to motivate potential supporters and participate in the voting.
