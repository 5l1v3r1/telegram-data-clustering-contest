      <h1>One of Baghdadi's wives was secretly captured before ISIS leader 'died like a dog'</h1>
      <h2>Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan announced the news today - and appeared to take a swipe at how Donald Trump told the world of Baghdadi's demise</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:15:48+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Turkey captured one of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/who-isis-leader-abu-bakr-20734717">Baghdadi's</a> wives more than a year ago but only revealed the news today as they didn't 'want to make a fuss'.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes more than a week after the evil ISIS leader was "obliterated" and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-donald-trump-baghdadi-killed-20735381">"died like a dog"</a> during a raid in Syria by U.S. special forces.</p>
      <p>The hate-filled thug spent his final moments in "utter fear, total panic and dread" before detonating a suicide vest in a tunnel where he dragged three kids with him.</p>
      <p>Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan announced the news earlier today of the wife's capture, which also comes after other family members of the killer were apprehended.</p>

      <p>However, Mr Erdogan appeared to take a swipe at the way the U.S announced Baghdadi's death, which was revealed to the world by President <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> during a press conference at the White House. </p>
      <p>Mr Erdogan said: "The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this.</p>
      <p>"But, I am announcing it here for the first time: We captured his wife and didn't make a fuss like them.</p>
      <p>"Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother in law in Syria."</p>

      <p>He gave no further details.</p>
      <p>A senior Turkish official said that the operation in which Baghdadi's wife was detained took place on June 2, 2018 when Turkish police captured a group of 11 Islamic State suspects in Turkey's Hatay province.</p>
      <p>He said one of the four women caught in the operation identified herself as someone else but was in fact Asma Fawzi Muhammad Al-Qubaysi - Baghdadi's first wife.</p>
      <p>"We discovered her real identity pretty quickly. At that point, she volunteered a lot of information about Baghdadi and the inner workings of ISIS," the official said, adding that the information led to a series of arrests elsewhere.</p>

      <p>A DNA test confirmed that another suspect was Baghdadi's daughter, and the detainees were being held at a deportation centre in Turkey.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, a senior Turkish official said Turkey had captured Baghdadi's sister, her husband and daughter-in-law.</p>
      <p>They added that they hoped to gain intelligence from them about Islamic State, although they has not said what knowledge they may have had about the group's operations.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself caliph of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and Syria from 2014-2017 before Islamic State's control was wrested away by a U.S.-led coalition.</p>

      <p>World leaders have welcomed his death, but they and security experts warned that the group, which carried out atrocities against religious minorities and horrified most Muslims, remained a security threat in Syria and beyond.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo previously said two of Baghdadi's wives had also been killed at the site of last month's raid.</p>
      <p>The group said a successor to Baghdadi, identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi, had been appointed.</p>
      <p>A senior U.S. official said last week that Washington was looking at the new leader to determine where he came from.</p>
