Jeff Sessions to run for old Alabama Senate seat
06 Nov 2019, 23:15 by Madison Dibble
Jeff Sessions is expected to announce his bid for his old Alabama Senate seat on Thursday.
Sessions, 72, left his seat to become President Trump’s first attorney general. The two parted ways after a contentious tenure following Sessions' decision to recuse himself from Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump’s campaign and ties to Russia.
Republicans lost control of Sessions’ seat after Republican Judge Roy Moore, who was accused of sexually harassing teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones.
The seat is considered to be a pickup option for Republicans in 2020.
Sessions will face a crowded primary battle if he enters the race. Some of the announced candidates include former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Rep. Bradley Byrne, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, and Moore.
