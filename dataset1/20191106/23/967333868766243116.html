      <p>Several air and boat crews have been actively searching the waters some 4 miles south of Hurlburt Field, Florida, since a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201909071076742453-air-force-invest-disposable-aircraft/">US Air Force</a> service member from the 24th Special Operations Wing went missing at around 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <blockquote>Florida news outlet <a href="https://weartv.com/news/local/coast-guard-airman-missing-after-falling-from-c-130">WEAR-TV</a> reported that the man fell approximately 460 meters (roughly 1,500 feet), but his parachute did deploy prior to him landing in the water. Although he was last seen treading water, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910311077192893-photos-nose-gear-on-us-air-force-c-130-transport-collapses-on-runway/">C-130</a> crew had lost sight of him by the time they circled around to rescue him.</blockquote>
      <p>In addition to groups from Hurlburt Field, the Coast Guard has deployed three separate aircrews and a number of boat crews, according to the <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/11/06/breaking-special-tactics-airman-missing-in-gulf-of-mexico-search-underway/">Air Force Times</a>.</p>

      <p>Rescue efforts are taking place within a 700-square-mile area. The airman’s identity has not yet been released.</p>
