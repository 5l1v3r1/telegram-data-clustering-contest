      <p><b>Toyota </b>is readying a <b>rally-inspired hot hatch</b> based on the <b>2020 Yaris</b> – and the first prototype will be unveiled in Australia this month.</p>
      <p>Based on the picture we have here, it's clear the GR-4 will be something fairly serious. The rear arches are seriously swollen, suggesting the performance <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/yaris/">Yaris</a> will have a wider rear track than the standard car.</p>
      <p>Given it's wrapped in the same camouflage as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/supra/">GR Supra</a> prototype we drove, it appears this will be a proper <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a> Gazoo Racing performance car.</p>

      <p>The GR-4 name also offers a few hints as to what the high-performance Yaris has to offer. Previously, the GT4 and GT-Four badges have been used on rally-inspired Toyota road cars with all-wheel drive in the past, so there's a chance the Yaris will have the same.</p>
      <p>Under the skin, the new Yaris (above) rides on a variation of the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) chassis dubbed GA-B. It's lighter and stiffer than before, and the TNGA family has proven Toyota still knows how to make a car handle, so signs are good for the hot Yaris.</p>
      <p>Toyota has also dipped its toe into the hot hatch waters recently, developing the limited-run Yaris GRMN (below) for Europe. Just 400 were built, powered by a 1.8-litre supercharged engine – and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/767695/2019-toyota-yaris-grmn-review/"><b>our reviews suggest it's a pretty handy thing</b></a>.</p>

      <p>The Yaris GR-4 will be unveiled at Rally Australia in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. Stay tuned for more.</p>
