      <p>A 10-year-old boy is in critical but stable condition after he was shot in the head as he was walking home from school during a drive-by shooting in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> on Wednesday, police said.</p>
      <p>The gunfire came from a car just after 3:30 p.m. Wednesday about two blocks from a middle school in the Frankford neighborhood in northeast <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-man-charged-with-murder-of-parents-brothers-inside-home-police">Philadelphia</a>, police said.</p>
      <p>The boy was hit in the back of the head while walking on Margaret Street near Torresdale Avenue, investigators said. He was rushed to a local children’s hospital in critical condition, they added.</p>

      <p>"Another child has been hit with gunfire at the hands of a coward," Deputy Commissioner Joe Sullivan, with the Philadelphia Police Department, said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Our heart goes out to this family,” he added.</p>
      <p>Sullivan called the shooting "unacceptable" and said he hopes the community will come forward with information to help solve the case.</p>
      <p>The gunfire came from the backseat of a red or maroon Pontiac G6, according to Sullivan.</p>
