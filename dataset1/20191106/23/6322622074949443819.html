      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 7): CGS-CIMB Retail Research has maintained its “Hold’ rating on Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd (F&amp;N) at RM35.30 with a higher price of RM36 and said F&amp;N targets to grow its Malaysia and Thailand domestic sales in FY20 through the launch of new innovative products and more effective marketing efforts.</p>
      <p>In a note Nov 6, the research house said particularly for Malaysia, new product launches were held back in FY19 as F&amp;N was focused on reformulating existing products (90% of beverages sold in Malaysia were below sugar excise duty threshold) to comply with the implementation of the sugar tax on<br/>Sept 1.</p>
      <p>“We lower our FY20-22F EPS estimates by 4.3-4.8% to mainly account for higher skim milk powder prices as well as higher capex assumptions.</p>
      <p>“Our Hold call remains with a higher DCF-based target price of RM36 as we roll over our valuation base year to 2021.</p>
      <p>“Upside/downside risks: sharp decline/rise in raw material prices and weak/stiff competition for its products,” it said.</p>
