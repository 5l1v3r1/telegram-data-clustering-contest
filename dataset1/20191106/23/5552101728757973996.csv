【加州北太浩湖（中）】住Squaw Valley賞奇觀　夏天看比基尼配雪景
06 Nov 2019, 23:57 by 童心怡, 童心怡
太浩湖之所以深受遊客歡迎，是因為這裡不只有優美湖畔，還能從事各種休閒活動，尤其是湖區得天獨厚的環境，造就這一帶成為美國重要的滑雪勝地，聚集在周圍的多間知名滑雪度假村，包括曾經在1960年舉辦過冬奧的「Squaw Valley」。


搭乘纜車就可以欣賞沿途雪景，還能直登山頂。



山頂上的360度景觀餐廳可以飽覽周圍景色。

當地的雪季通常從每年10月開始，直到隔年5月，當雪季較長時，甚至可延長至7月初，因此造就不少奇特的滑雪風景，常常能看到穿著短褲短袖或只穿比基尼滑雪客在度假村內，讓來自亞熱帶的我看得嘖嘖稱奇。


即便已進入夏季，還是有許多滑雪客到Squaw Valley滑雪。

Squaw Valley裡面有好幾家酒店，如果一家四口，或是想要自己開伙，建議入住「The Village at Squaw Valley」度假村，除了附設廚房、餐桌與客廳，還有寬敞的陽台，Squaw Valley通常過了傍晚5、6點，大部分的商店就已打烊，如果好幾個家庭一起來當地度假，住在這間酒店就能到各房串門子，有充足聊天聚會的空間。


The Village at Squaw Valley的臥房舒適，整天滑雪健行下來，能好好睡上一覺。



客房內空間寬敞，設有廚房、餐桌與客廳，適合家庭同住。

度假村內有咖啡店、雜貨舖、戶外用品和藝廊等各式各樣的商店，但我最推薦體驗的是乘坐纜車，10分鐘內就可以垂直上升600公尺的高度，直接登上海拔2,500公尺的山頂，這裡除了有一間360的環境餐廳，還有觀景台能飽覽Squaw Valley與太浩湖畔的壯麗風光。

[California North Lake Tahoe (middle)] Staying at Squaw Valley to see the wonders Summer looking at the bikini with snow
06 Nov 2019, 23:57 by Tong Xinyi, Tong Xinyi
The reason why Lake Tahoe is popular with tourists is that it is not only beautiful lakeside, but also a variety of leisure activities, especially the unique environment of the Lake District. This area has become an important ski resort in the United States, gathering many well-known skiers around. The resort includes the ""Squaw Valley"" which was once held in Winter in 1960.


Take the cable car to enjoy the snow scenery along the way, and climb the top.



The 360-degree view restaurant on the top of the hill offers a panoramic view of the surroundings.

The local snow season usually starts from October every year until May of the following year. When the snow season is long, it can even be extended to the beginning of July. Therefore, it creates a lot of strange ski scenery, and often can see short sleeves or only wear shorts. Bikini skiers are in the resort and I am amazed by the subtropical.


Even after entering the summer, many skiers go skiing in Squaw Valley.

There are several hotels in Squaw Valley. If you have a family of four, or if you want to start your own business, it is recommended to stay at the ""The Village at Squaw Valley"" resort. In addition to the kitchen, dining table and living room, and the spacious balcony, Squaw Valley usually passes. At 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, most of the shops have been snoring. If several families come to the local holiday together, staying at this hotel will be able to go to the various rooms and have plenty of room for chat and party.


The Village at Squaw Valley has comfortable bedrooms, skiing all day, and taking a good night's sleep.



The room is spacious and has a kitchen, dining table and living room, suitable for families.

There are a variety of shops in the resort, such as coffee shops, grocery stores, outdoor products and art galleries, but I recommend the cable car. You can climb 600 meters in 10 minutes and climb up to 2,500 meters. On the top of the mountain, there is a 360-room restaurant, and the observation deck offers spectacular views of Squaw Valley and Lake Tahoe.
