      <p>SINGAPORE: The Indian worker who died in a crane collapse at a construction site in Novena was the sole breadwinner of his family.</p>
      <p>Mr Velmurugan Muthian, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene after a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/crane-collapse-novena-tan-tock-seng-construction-site-worker-12060694">crane collapsed during a lifting operation</a> at the construction site of a new rehab facility in Jalan Tan Tock Seng on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>

      <p>Mr Velmurugan's body is set to be flown back to India early on Thursday, accompanied by his cousin who is also a worker here, said Ms Dipa Swaminathan, founder of ItsRainingRaincoats, an initiative that gives help to migrant workers in Singapore.</p>
      <p>As he was a Hindu, his body is likely to be cremated sometime on Thursday, she added.</p>
      <p>Mr Velmurugan, who was from Tamil Nadu, was employed by LKT Contractors and had only been working in Singapore for about three months. </p>
      <p>He previously worked here for more than five years, then returned to India to get married.</p>

      <p>His wife, elderly parents and younger brother rely on his paycheck, and a few days before the accident, he received news that his wife was expecting their first child, said ItsRainingRaincoats.</p>
      <p>In a post on its Facebook page, the volunteer organisation shared a link to a crowdfunding campaign, which has raised more than S$57,000 at the time of writing. Two volunteers also gave white packets to Mr Velmurugan’s cousin, Ms Dipa said.</p>
      <p>The money will be sent to his family in India.</p>
      <p>“We will likely wait for his cousin to return from India and pass him the money in person so he can give it to the family,” Ms Dipa said.</p>
      <p>She said they want to make sure that the money is spent well and that it will go to the family.</p>
      <p>She told CNA that the crowdfunding campaign will likely remain up until Mr Velmurugan’s cousin returns to Singapore on Nov 14.</p>
      <p>Of the decision to put Mr Velmurugan’s details on the social media website, Ms Dipa said: “Our real goal, more than the money, was that we didn't want him to be another statistic. We wanted everyone to know his name and story.”</p>
