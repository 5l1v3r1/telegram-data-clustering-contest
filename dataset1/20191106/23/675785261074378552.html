      <h1>Eddie Murphy 'tried to stop Whitney Houston marrying Bobby Brown' on wedding day</h1>
      <h2>A new memoir by Robyn Crawford has detailed her life with Whitney Houston and has revealed that Eddie Murphy looked to make a last minute intervention on her wedding day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T23:55:28+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Eddie Murphy allegedly made a last minute bid to stop <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/whitney-houston">Whitney Houston</a> marrying Bobby Brown, according to a new memoir by the singer's closest friend.</p>
      <p>Robyn Crawford has penned the book that shares intimate details of her friendship with superstar singer Whitney.</p>
      <p>Crawford was the singer's best friend for more than three decades and she has recalled how Whitney was once infatuated with Hollywood star Eddie Murphy.</p>
      <p>In her book, Crawford has revealed that while Bobby Brown pursued the attentions of Whitney in 1989, she was hoping for a bit of romance with Murphy, and "lost herself" in the process.</p>
      <p>Crawford wrote: "She was more interested in Eddie Murphy, but he was elusive.”</p>

      <p>They were supposedly meant to get together for a dinner date at Whitney's New Jersey mansion and she went all out to impress Murphy.</p>
      <p>Crawford wrote about that night: "One day when Eddie was supposed to come for dinner, I caught a glimpse of Whitney.</p>
      <p>"She was wearing a black dress and low-heeled slingbacks. For a moment, I thought ‘Boy, I wish she was doing that for me.'"</p>

      <p>It was to end in sadness though as Murphy "never showed up that night,” leaving Whitney devastated by the rejection.</p>
      <p>On the morning of her wedding day on July 18, 1992, Whitney was getting ready to say "I do" to Bobby Brown, when she received a surprise call from Murphy.</p>
      <p>He was allegedly making a last ditch attempt to stop Whitney from tying the knot with the singer but it was to fall on deaf ears.</p>

      <p>Crawford recalled: "[That day] Eddie Murphy called to say she was making a mistake, but she pressed ahead.”</p>
      <p>Whitney's health and wellbeing would be on a slippery slope from then on and Crawford said that it was difficult watching her friend becoming isolated.</p>
      <p>She is hoping that her book will redress the view of Whitney and share what a 'big hearted and generous friend' she was.</p>

      <p>Crawford said: "I have a lot of beautiful, wonderful, exciting, adventurous, loving, caring memories of Whitney.</p>
      <p>"Whitney was a beautiful friend, the friend that I prayed for."</p>
      <p>Whitney's tragic death at the age of 48 came amid her spiralling descent into debt after blowing her $100million fortune on drugs.</p>
      <p>She drowned in a bath at the Beverly Hilton hotel in February 2012, having binged on cocaine, cannabis and prescription drugs before her final moments.</p>
