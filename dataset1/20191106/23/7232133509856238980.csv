XRP May Target $0.45 in Near-Term Despite Falling Below $0.30

06 Nov 2019, 23:00

After a brief period of trading above its long-established resistance level at $0.30, XRP has once again fallen back into the upper-$0.20 region, which may mean that it is in for an extended bout of sideways trading.
Analysts are still optimistic, however, that the cryptocurrency could see further gains in the near-term, with one analyst setting a target at $0.45 – which would mark a significant surge from its current price levels.
XRP Struggles to Hold Above $0.30  
At the time of writing, XRP is trading up just under 1% at its current price of just under $0.30, which is around where it has been trading for the past several days.
XRP’s inability to decisively close above $0.30 does signal that bears still have strength in spite of the crypto’s recovery from its multi-month lows of $0.24, but it is important to note that any notable break above this level could spark a major uptrend for the embattled crypto.
Loma, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that he believes a break above $0.30 could be sparked by the ongoing Ripple Swell conference, but further adding that there is a decent chance that XRP does not incur its annual “Swell pump” this year.
“$XRP: Taking a look at the USDT-pairing and I’d say we have at most 10% leading into Swell and that’s IF price clears the 30c resistance. Swell might be an absolute BUST this year,” he explained while pointing to the below chart.



Could Embattled Crypto Target $0.45 in Near-Term? 
Although Loma believes there is a decent chance that XRP does not break above $0.30 in the near-term, Eric Choe, another popular cryptocurrency analyst, believes that if the crypto holds above its current price levels, a movement to $0.45 could be in the cards.
“#xrp #ripple If red box can hold, possible $0.45,” he concisely noted while pointing to the chart seen below.



As Swell continues on and as XRP trades sideways around $0.30, it is highly probable that it will quickly grow increasingly clear as to whether or not it will be able to gain enough momentum in the near-term to send it towards $0.45.
