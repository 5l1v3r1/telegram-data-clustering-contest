      <p>Coronation Street viewers were worried about Daniel Osbourne, claiming he looked "unwell" as he finally made contact with dad Ken Barlow.</p>
      <p>Daniel fled to Scotland with baby son Bertie in the wake of his wife Sinead Tinker's death, following a battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>The grieving character needed some space, as planning his wife's funeral left him overhwelmed.</p>
      <p>His dad begged him to return back to the Street in the latest episode, as the family continued to plan the funeral without him.</p>
      <p>But Daniel shocked his loved ones, as he revealed no plans to be back in time for his wife's send off.</p>
