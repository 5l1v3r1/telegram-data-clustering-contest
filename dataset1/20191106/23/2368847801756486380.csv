墨國毒梟殺美國婦孺9死 川普籲合作打擊墨總統拒絕

06 Nov 2019, 23:57

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】美國摩門教基本教義派的LeBaron家族9名婦孺，近日在墨西哥北部行車途中遭販毒集團槍手殺害。為此，美國總統川普（特朗普）向墨西哥喊話，希望美國能出手幫助墨西哥剿滅邊境上的販毒集團，但墨總統拒絕了這個提議。
據《美國之音》報導，墨西哥總統奧布拉多爾（Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador）拒絕了川普總統提出的美墨聯手剿滅墨西哥境內的販毒集團的提議。他聲明，墨西哥將「獨立自主」地追捕襲擊事件背後的兇手。
奧布拉稱，擊斃販毒集團成員不能解決問題。他說：「當然，我們不希望發生這樣的事件，可是我們不認為用子彈、屠殺，用武力、血腥手段和火力可以解決問題。」
近年來，墨西哥毒梟的犯罪活動日益猖獗。就在今年11月4日，美國知名的摩門教徒LeBaron家族的3名母親帶着14名孩子分乘3輛車前往機場時，在途中遭犯罪集團的槍手伏擊，至少有3名婦女和6名孩童在襲擊中喪命。
墨西哥內政部長杜佐拉說，慘遭殺害的摩門教徒家庭成員所乘坐的雪佛蘭Suburban越野車，可能被襲擊者誤認為是爭奪這個地區控制權的另一個犯罪組織的車輛而受到攻擊，導致9名婦女兒童成為了兩大幫派勢力對決的受害者。
川普得知這個消息後大為光火，在社交媒體上發文，誓言要清理美墨邊境上的這些「禽獸」。他在臉書上寫道，「兩個販毒集團的武力衝突導致美國人傷亡，當中不乏孩童，如果墨西哥需要，或要求協助來掃蕩這些禽獸，美國已經準備好，也願意介入，且能夠把事情處理得又快又好。」
川普向奧夫拉多爾喊話，指毒梟的勢力和武力已龐大到需要動用「軍隊」來對付。他寫道，「這是墨西哥與美國合作的時刻，向毒梟宣戰，將他們趕出地球表面，現在只等墨西哥優秀的新總統一通電話。」
美國共和黨籍聯邦參議員羅姆尼，週二對川普的上述倡議表示贊同。他說：「我們和墨西哥的關係良好，可是在邊境發生的毒品集團的事件和暴力情況惡化，以及如何對付他們，是我們、也是墨西哥政府面對的切實問題。長期以來，墨西哥政府一直在處理這個問題，可是至今沒有解決，甚至在惡化。所以，總統說，『我們必須認真對待』，並且表示願意幫助。我認為這是正確的態度。」

Obra said that members of the drug trafficking group could not solve the problem. He said: ""Of course, we do not want such an incident, but we do not think that using bullets, slaughter, using force, bloody means and firepower can solve the problem.""
In recent years, criminal activities of drug lords in Mexico have become increasingly rampant. On November 4 this year, three mothers of the well-known Mormon LeBaron family in the United States took 14 children and took three cars to the airport. On the way, they were ambushed by criminal group gunmen, at least 3 women and 6 The child was killed in the attack.

After learning the news, Trump was very angry. He sent a message on social media and vowed to clean up these ""birds"" on the US-Mexico border. He wrote on Facebook, ""The armed conflict between the two drug trafficking groups has caused American casualties. There are many children. If Mexico needs it, or asks for assistance to sweep up these animals, the United States is ready and willing to intervene and be able to get things done. It’s processing fast and good.”
Trump yelled at Obrador, saying that the power and force of the drug lords were so large that they needed to use the ""army"" to deal with them. He wrote, ""This is the moment when Mexico cooperates with the United States to declare war on the drug lords and drive them out of the surface of the earth. Now, just wait for the excellent new president of Mexico to call.""
US Republican Senator Romney agreed on Trump’s aforementioned initiative on Tuesday. He said: ""We have a good relationship with Mexico, but the incidents and violence of drug groups at the border have deteriorated and how to deal with them is a practical problem for us and the Mexican government. For a long time, the Mexican government has been dealing with it. This problem has not been resolved or even worsened so far. Therefore, the President said, ""We must take it seriously and express our willingness to help. I think this is the right attitude.""
