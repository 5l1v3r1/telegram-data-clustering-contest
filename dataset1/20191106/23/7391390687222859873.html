      <p>Kenya Moore's daughter Brooklyn just turned a year old on Nov. 3, but the<i> Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> star is already interested in expanding her family. <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kenya-moore-is-considering-having-2nd-baby-via-surrogate/">Kenya wants to have more kids through surrogacy</a> in the future, as she said in a in a Nov. 6 interview with <i>Us Weekly.</i> The reality star told the publication, that due to some complications she had during her first pregnancy, surrogacy is "probably the only way I could carry, have a child again.” When Kenya was pregnant with her daughter, she suffered from preeclampsia, which is characterized by high blood pressure and swelling.</p>
      <p>As a result, <a href="https://people.com/parents/kenya-moore-wants-more-kids-after-daughter-exclusive/">Kenya went into labor early and had a rather traumatic delivery</a>, which she discussed in a December 2018 interview with <i>People</i>. While she was in labor, doctors cut Kenya horizontally and vertically to avoid fibroids that could have caused her to bleed to death. The procedure typically takes a half hour, but for Kenya, it took three hours. As a result, the epidural wore off, so doctors gave her anesthesia to fall asleep, but when she woke up she said she thought she had died.</p>
      <p>Kenya told the magazine, "I couldn’t see but I could hear everything. And I was trying to talk, but I couldn’t get the words out — nobody could hear me." The Real Housewife of Atlanta continued, "I thought, ‘I didn’t make it. I lost too much blood.’ I literally thought I was dead and had passed away. Because my thoughts were there, I was present. But no one could see that I was struggling, trying to wake up. It was crazy." In that <i>People </i>interview, Kenya said she was open to different possibilities when it comes to having more kids, including adoption.</p>

      <p>In her Nov. 6 <i>Us Weekly</i> interview, Kenya shared, <i>"</i>Brooklyn loves other kids. I would like for her to have a playmate and someone who is like her confidant and close [friend], and I want that for her. I just don’t know [when]."</p>
      <p>Her recent <i>Us Weekly </i>interview comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rhoa-star-kenya-moore-marc-daly-split-after-2-years-of-marriage-18788821">her split from husband Marc Daly</a>, which was announced in September via individual statements that they shared with <i>People</i>. However, it doesn't seem like their relationship is completely over, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rhoas-kenya-moore-marc-daly-are-open-to-getting-back-together-19300579">or at least Kenya seems to hope it is not</a>. This week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmsvi8cF-Rg">Kenya revealed that she and Marc shared a kiss</a> after Brookyln's first birthday party during an appearance on <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i>. In a Nov. 5 appearance on E! Network's <i>Daily Pop</i>, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1089838/why-kenya-moore-isn-t-taking-off-her-ring-from-marc-daly-just-yet">Kenya made it clear that she was keeping her rings</a> on until they have divorced, but neither of them has filed yet. She said she had some hope for a reconciliation with her estranged husband.</p>
