      <p>“Look forward to seeing President Erdogan next Wednesday, November 13th at the White House!” Trump wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>President Erdogan also visited the White House in 2017.</p>
      <p>The president revealed on Twitter that he had a phone conversation with Erdogan, who said that they had captured “numerous” ISIS fighters, including a wife and a sister of former ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</p>
      <p>Trump invited Erdogan to visit the White House despite the president’s decision to invade Syria to attack Kurdish forces near the border of Turkey.</p>
      <p>President Trump responded by threatening strict economic sanctions on Turkey, ultimately leading to a ceasefire.</p>
      <p>Trump said he discussed with Erdogan the possibility of ending fighting against the Kurds, securing the Turkish border in Syria, and eliminating terrorism in the region.</p>
