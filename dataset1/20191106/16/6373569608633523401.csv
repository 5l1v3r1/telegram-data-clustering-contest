Lidl is selling a luxury cheese advent calendar

If you love cheese and you love Christmas, Lidl have got you sorted this festive season with a CHEESE advent calendar.
It seems every year supermarkets are competing each other and taking their advent calendars to that next level by seeing what crazy addition they can add to the mix.
Aldi's sell-out wine advent calendar is back for 2019 and the M&S beauty advent calendar is just £40 for £300 worth of products.
But this year Lidl have won Christmas by launching a cheese advent calendar. The German discount chain is also selling a luxury candle calendar and even a milk-free range.
The British Cheese Advent Calendar will set you back £7.99, and is filled with eight varieties of miniature cheeses - including a festive selection - and cheesy jokes.
Cheese lovers will be treated to a variety of flavours including Jarlsberg, Double Gloucester, Cheddar and Christmassy flavours Wensleydale with Cranberries and Gingerbread.
But be warned -  it must be kept in the fridge.
