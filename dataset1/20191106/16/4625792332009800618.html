      <h1>Stacey Abrams 'happy' to run as vice president with nominee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T16:29:28+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Amid months of speculation, Stacey Abrams said that she would be “happy” to run for vice president alongside the Democratic nominee.</p>
      <p>Abrams is the 45-year-old former Democratic nominee for Georgia governor who lost a close race against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018. She has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/stacey-abrams-calls-biden-running-mate-rumors-pure-speculation">repeatedly tamped down rumors</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2020-pow-wow-joe-biden-and-stacey-abrams-meet-in-washington">a meeting she held in March</a> with Joe Biden, 76, was to discuss running as his number two.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event in Iowa on Monday, Abrams said that she would consider joining the ticket of whoever wins the nomination, <a href="https://dailyiowan.com/2019/11/04/stacey-abrams-happy-to-run-as-vice-presidential-candidate-she-says-at-university-of-iowa/">according</a> to the <i>Daily Iowan</i>.</p>
      <p>“You do not run in a primary for second place, so no, for whatever rumors are out there,” Abrams said. “However, I’m not in the primary, but you can run as second in the general election, and I am happy to do so with the nominee. That is my answer.”</p>
      <p>There was also some speculation that Abrams, who has little political experience beyond the state legislature, would run for president. Abrams went <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/stacey-abrams-reverses-2020-run-is-now-definitely-on-the-table">back and forth</a> on whether she wanted to run for president, try for a Georgia Senate seat in 2020, or make another gubernatorial bid in 2022. But she <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/will-not-be-a-candidate-stacey-abrams-rules-out-run-for-senate-in-georgia">ruled out both a Senate run</a> in August and a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/stacey-abrams-rules-out-2020-presidential-run-report">presidential run</a> that same month.</p>
