      <p>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator TC Energy Corp has declared force majeure after a spill forced its Keystone oil pipeline to shut down last week, the second consecutive month it has made the declaration, sources said.</p>
      <p>TC told shippers that the shutdown means that it cannot carry out 30% of their normal November shipments on the 590,000 barrel-per-day line from Alberta to U.S. Midwest refineries.</p>
      <p>That implies that the company is estimating the line would be shut for about 10 days, one of the sources said, adding that TC made the declaration last week.</p>
      <p>A TC Energy spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about force majeure.</p>
      <p>Last month, TC declared force majeure on Keystone due to a snowstorm in Manitoba.</p>
      <p>The pipeline spilled more than 9,000 barrels in rural North Dakota last week. On Tuesday, a U.S. regulator ordered that a segment of Keystone remain shut until TC Energy submits a restart and return-to-service plan because of the hazards posed.</p>
      <p>TC is reviewing terms of the order and will comply with requirements to ensure the pipelineâ€™s integrity, company spokesman Terry Cunha said.</p>
      <p>Keystone is a vital artery for Canadian heavy crude, imported by the United States for blending with other oils and refined into gasoline, diesel and other fuels.</p>
