New AirPods Pro deal returns to $235, 15-inch MacBook Pro nearly $300 off, more
06 Nov 2019, 16:59 by Trevor Daugherty
We have a notable AirPods Pro deal this morning, alongside nearly $300 off Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Pro, and discounts on official iPad cases. Hit the jump for all that and more in the latest 9to5Toys Lunch Break.
AirPods Pro deal brings prices back to $235
A new Apple AirPods Pro deal has surfaced this morning, returning prices to $235 at Costco. That’s down from the usual $249 going rate at Amazon and a match of the best offer we’ve seen. With various other retailers experiencing delayed shipping, this is a great time to pick up Apple’s new flagship earbuds at a discount. AirPods Pro delivers a refreshed take of the popular original version, now featuring active noise cancellation, tapered silicone tips, and a water-resistant design. Apple’s H1 chip ensures you have fast connectivity and up to 24 hours of battery life. Save roughly $90 and go with Apple’s second-generation AirPods.
Take nearly $300 off Apple’s latest 15-inch MacBook Pro
Amazon offers Apple’s 2019 15-inch MacBook Pro with 512 GB of storage for $2,500. Today’s deal is $299 off the regular going rate and the second-best offer we’ve tracked at Amazon. This model offers a 9th generation 8-core Intel i9 processor, Retina display, Touch Bar, and four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Not only will you be getting the latest tech from Apple, but also a mobile powerhouse capable of handling a wide-range of tasks. You can learn more in our hands-on review of Apple’s 2019 MacBook Pro lineup.
Apple 9.7-inch Smart Cover returns to Amazon all-time low
Amazon offers Apple’s official 9.7-inch iPad Smart Cover in various colors from $24. As a comparison, it regularly sells for $39, with today’s deal being a match of the best we’ve tracked. Apple’s official iPad Smart Covers delivers a “single piece of durable polyurethane to protect the front of your device.” This model offers a foldable cover, which can help prop up your device and also protect it from bumps and bruises along the way.
Yale Assure HomeKit Smart Lock has fallen to $152
BuyDig via Rakuten is offering the Yale Assure HomeKit Smart Lock (IM1) for $152. That’s $84 off the going rate found at retailers like Amazon and is within $20 of the lowest price we have tracked. This HomeKit smart lock can be armed/disarmed using Siri, the Apple Home app, a PIN code, and more. Additionally, it even works with Z-Wave smart home hubs, allowing you to set up custom automations with systems like SmartThings.
Take $170 off Pioneer’s 6.2-inch CarPlay Receiver
Best Buy’s official eBay storefront offers the Pioneer 6.2-inch CarPlay Receiver (AVIC-5201NEX) for $480. Also available directly from Best Buy. Usually selling for $650, like you’ll find at Amazon right now, today’s offer is the best we’ve tracked in months, comes within $30 of the previous price drop, and is the lowest currently available. Featuring an over six-inch touchscreen display, Pioneer’s CarPlay receiver is a must-have upgrade to your ride. It notably makes keeping an eye on directions, music playback, and more a breeze while commuting. I’ve been enjoying CarPlay for just over a year now and can wholeheartedly recommend for anyone in search of a no-fuss experience.



9to5Mac Deal of the Month:
Get 15% off OWC USB-C Travel Dock and 10% off the 10-Port USB-C Dock w/ code 9TO5DOCK.
