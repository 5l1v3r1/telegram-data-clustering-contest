      </p>
      <p>Rooney's two-season spell with MLS team DC United came to an end last month, when the US club were defeated in the play-offs by Canadian team Toronto FC, and the 34-year-old will now sign for Derby County when the transfer window opens in January.  </p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, England's all-time leading goalscorer has already reported for training with the Championship side ahead of his 18-month deal as he looks to familiarise himself with the club ahead of his official move.</p>

      <p>As part of Rooney's deal with Derby, the former Three Lions captain will earn about £100 000 (R1.9 million) a week and will also take up a coaching role at Pride Park in preparation for a new career in football once he hangs up his boots.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool-born forward returns to England, where he previously spent 16 seasons with the Toffees and the Red Devils and became the latter club's all-time leading goalscorer with 253 goals to his name.</p>
