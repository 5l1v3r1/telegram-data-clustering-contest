Recursive Kittens Are Recursive

Cindy Saucier's kittens became glued to the television when that little black cat ran across the football field mid-game this past Monday night.
The New York Giants-Dallas Cowboys game suddenly became a lot more interesting than most sportsball is for cats.
Watch what happens!
I love how there's a third cat in the situation who can't be bothered.
Here's Cindy Saucier's original tweet with the video:



And here's the story behind it, from ABC7:
Cindy Saucier was watching the New York Giants-Dallas Cowboys game with her husband, Daryl, their two 6-month-old kittens, Max and Leo, and the kittens' mother. As the black cat made its way onto the football field in MetLife Stadium, the kittens suddenly stopped playing and ran over to stare at the TV screen.Saucier recorded the adorbale video of the cats as they watched the incident unfold. The were pawing at the television screen and intently tilting their heads as the cat ran down the field. The kittens' mother even walks over at one point to see what is going on but is hardly interested in the football game and much more intrigued by objects below the television console.The cat was chased down the field by New Jersey State Troopers, and Westwood One Sports radio announcer Kevin Harlan jokingly continued his play-by-play commentary, according to reports. ""A state trooper has come on the field and the cat runs into the end zone. That is a touchdown,"" Harlan said.
