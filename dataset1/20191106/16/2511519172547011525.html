      <h1>Starbucks unveils 2019 holiday cups - and offers free reusable option</h1>
      <h2>Coffee chain's festive cups will return on 7 November </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T16:56:04+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Chelsea Ritschel</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/starbucks">Starbucks</a> has once again unveiled its annual <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Holiday">holiday</a> cups, signalling the start of the most <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/festive">festive</a> time of year. </p>
      <p>On Thursday, customers will officially be able to order the chain’s holiday drinks, which will be served in cups of red, white and green.</p>
      <p>And it appears the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Coffee">coffee</a> chain has listened to its customers’ wishes, as the cups are undeniably festive. </p>
      <p>This year, the chain’s notoriously controversial cups, which were previously <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/starbucks-holiday-cups-christmas-red-green-festive-designs-a8613056.html">accused</a> of not being “Christmas-themed” enough, feature designs such as green polka dots on a red background and red and white candy-cane stripes. </p>
      <p>Two of the designs are emblazoned with the phrase “Merry Coffee,” repeated over and over again. </p>

      <p>Customers will also receive a free, limited-edition reusable red cup with the same slogan when they order a holiday beverage - which also return on 7 November. </p>

      <p>This year, customers can fulfil their holiday cravings with options including Peppermint Mocha, Toasted White Chocolate, Caramel Brulée Latte, Chestnut Praline Latte, and the Eggnog Latte.</p>
      <p>The chain will be selling a range of holiday-themed snacks as well, including gingerbread loaf and sugar plum danishes. </p>
      <p>If that weren’t cheery enough, customers can also expect baristas to look the part, as Starbucks revealed to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/business/starbucks-holiday-cups/index.html"><i>CNN</i></a> that “you’ll see our partners all in red aprons this year”, adding that in the past the red aprons were worn “sort of infrequently”.</p>
      <p>On social media, this year’s cup reveal has been well-received. </p>
      <p>“The holiday cups are cute, good on Starbucks this year,” one person wrote. </p>
      <p>Another said: “Starbucks’ holiday cups are so cute this year, I’m excited.”</p>
