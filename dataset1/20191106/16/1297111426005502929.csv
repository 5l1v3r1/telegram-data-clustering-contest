The Saskatchewan Roughriders can be proud of their 2019 report card.
The Riders finished with a 13-5 record after opening the CFL season at 1-3. Saskatchewan clinched first place in the West Division for the first time since 2009 and that accomplishment contributed to the overall A grade.
Saskatchewan earned a bye to the division final on Nov. 17 and will host the winner of Sunday’s West Division semifinal between the Calgary Stampeders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers.
Here’s how the Riders grade out, position by position, following the regular season:

QUARTERBACKS

Cody Fajardo led the CFL in passing yards (4,302) while completing 18 touchdown passes against eight interceptions and rushing for 10 touchdowns.

RUNNING BACKS

OFFENSIVE LINE

The Riders’ offensive line received a boost with the returns of guards Brendon LaBatte and Philip Blake from injury for the stretch run. Centre Dan Clark enjoyed his best of eight CFL seasons and right tackle Thaddeus Coleman remains solid. Terran Vaughn and Takoby Cofield both contributed at left tackle. The Riders tied for fourth with 37 sacks allowed, which hurts their grade. Grade: B.

RECEIVERS

COACHING

Rookie head coach Craig Dickenson guided the Riders to first place in the West Division with a first-year starter at quarterback. The Riders scored 44 offensive touchdowns, 19 more than in 2018, and that’s a credit to offensive co-ordinator Stephen McAdoo. Jason Shivers has the defence playing at an elite level in his first year as defensive co-ordinator. Grade: B.

PLAYER PERSONNEL

General manager Jeremy O’Day deserves a high grade for signing Fajardo to a free-agent contract and later to a two-year extension. O’Day also bolstered the Riders with free-agent signings like Powell, Johnson, Leonard and receivers Cory Watson and Manny Arceneaux. GRADE: A.
