The Christmas countdown is fast approaching and for many beauty fans that means advent calendars filled with cosmetics.
As December gets closer, Boots have launched its first premium beauty advent calendar in collaboration with Glamour UK and you can buy it in store and online now.
The festive countdown is packed with £280 worth of beautifying treats from the likes of Too Faced, Fenty Beauty, Estée Lauder and much more - but shoppers can snap one up for just £85.
With so many decadent advent calendars available, costing up to £100 and more, the Glamour x Boots offering gives shoppers the chance to indulge on a vast selection of lust-worthy items without hurting their wallet.

The box also looks spectacular, featuring the words ""Your Beauty Your Rules"" at the front and opening up to reveal 25 pull-out windows that are each numbered with gold metallic lettering.
If all that has tempted you, we'd advise snapping one up soon as these won't be around for long.
