自導自演？港親共議員6日遇刺 大公報5日晚提前報導

06 Nov 2019, 16:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】香港親共立法會議員何君堯6日上午「遇刺」，本就疑點重重。網友更發現，香港黨媒大公報早在5日晚間就已在臉書發出何君堯「6日遇刺住院」的視頻，因此紛紛質疑此事是港府自導自演，栽贓嫁禍香港抗議者。
據親共港媒當地時間11月6日報導，當天上午9時許，何君堯在屯門擺街站為區議會選舉拉票期間，遭人以刀狀物體直刺胸口，清醒送院，事後證實僅受2cm皮外傷。
但香港網友發現，大公報臉書專頁早在當地時間5日晚間7時54分，就已「報導」了此事。大公報帖文稱，「何君堯6日上午遇襲，被假裝粉絲的藍衣男子刺傷」，「當天11時許」發微博報平安。帖文甚至附上了何君堯「在醫院臥床」的短片。


臉書時間顯示，當地時間5日晚間，大公報就發布了「6日上午何君堯遇刺」的報導。（臉書截圖）

網友紛紛質疑中共自演「苦肉計」，譏諷大公報「預知未來」，「可獲諾貝爾獎」。還有網友嘲諷何君堯「今日遇刺昨晚住院」是「穿越時空」，「上星期就已康復出院了」。
新唐人記者查詢大公報臉書頁面發現，該專頁在發布「何君堯遇刺」帖文前，已經超過一週沒有更新，之前最後一條帖文還停留在10月28日。在香港時間11月5日晚間7時54分（美東時間5日早上6時54分）突然發布「何君堯6日遇刺」的帖文後，該專頁開始密集更新，截至目前至少已發布8條帖文跟進「何君堯事件」。
在積極跟進「何君堯遇刺」的同時，該專頁也開始密集發帖，宣傳北京高層日前要求港首林鄭月娥「止惡制暴」的命令，這與炒作「何君堯遇刺」基調吻合。
網上有人辯稱，臉書顯示大公報5日晚間發帖，可能是「臉書系統時間錯誤」。但本台記者發現，大公報專頁在該條帖文後密集更新，後續帖文未顯示「時間錯亂」跡象。另外，該專頁在後續跟進「何君堯遇刺」的帖文中，事發時間都是使用「今日（6日）」或「今早」字樣，唯獨5日晚的帖文沒有註明「今日」，反而使用過去式「當天」。因此網友也普遍質疑，這篇帖文並非6日發布。
大公網當晚在其網站發文，堅決否認5日晚提前發帖，並聲稱該報6日上午11時43分收到何君堯的影片，「11時54分發布帖文」，但其後其臉書帳戶疑似遭入侵，帖文發布時間「被篡改成5日晚7時54分」。
但有比較了解臉書操作的推特網友斷言，這篇帖文的發布時間肯定沒有經過修改，因為臉書修改發帖時間的功能不能精確到個位分鐘。出現提前發布帖文情況的原因，極可能是大公報5日晚間預先發表了文字，但將帖文設置成隱藏狀態，第二天才公開發布，因此保留了帖文發布的原始時間。結論是這次襲擊肯定是有預謀，而且大公報事前知情。



為此，本台記者採訪了一位在美國媒體工作的資深FB社群媒體編輯。她表示，自己做過多年的FB編輯，有時候一天發幾十條貼文，有的帖文即時發出，有的帖文則先把內容寫上去，預設成未來某個時間發表。她從沒有碰到過貼文顯示時間跟實際貼文時間不同的情況，雖然FB常常會有一些bug，但沒碰到過這種錯誤。
該編輯認為，上述推文分析得有道理，很可能是大公報編輯5日晚就提前寫好了帖文，但先設置為隱藏狀態，直到6日才公開。
其實，早在親共港媒放出所謂「何君堯遇刺」的現場視頻時，就已引起外界質疑。網友提出五大疑點，包括拍片一氣呵成，從獻花到行動都有人紀錄；何君堯閃避反應太快，超乎常人；助選團等多人瞬間合力制伏施暴者，表現異常合拍；被制服的施襲者也沒有激烈掙扎；選在鬧區行凶也不合常理等等。

以下為大公報臉書專頁發布的「何君堯遇刺」現場視頻：




從反送中運動以來，何君堯言行不斷挑起港人憤慨，包括將抗爭者比喻為蟑螂，多次揚言暴力對待抗議者，7.21血洗元朗事件中與白衣人握手打氣等。何君堯還被挖出是中共地下黨員身份，近日又被英國安格里亞魯斯金大學撤銷名譽博士學位。

Self-directed and self-directed? Hong Kong pro-members were assassinated on the 6th. Ta Kung Pao reported on the evening of the 5th.

06 Nov 2019, 16:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Hong Kong pro-Communist legislator He Junyi was ""sacred"" on the morning of the 6th. The netizens also found that the Hong Kong party media communiqué had already sent a video of He Junyi’s ""sick on the 6th"" on Facebook on the evening of the 5th. Therefore, they all questioned that the matter was self-directed and self-directed by the Hong Kong government.
According to the local time of the pro-Communist Hong Kong media on November 6th, at 9 o'clock in the morning, during the canvassing of the district board elections at the Qimen Street Station, he was stabbed in the shape of a knife and was sent to the hospital. Subject to 2cm skin trauma.
However, Hong Kong netizens found that the Ta Kung Pao Facebook page had ""reported"" the matter as early as 7:54 pm local time on the 5th. Ta Kung Pao said that ""He Junyi was attacked on the morning of the 6th and was stabbed by a blue man who pretended to be a fan."" The post even attached a short video of He Junyi ""in bed at the hospital.""


Facebook time shows that on the evening of the 5th local time, Ta Kung Pao published a report on ""The 6th morning of He Junyi's assassination."" (Facebook screenshot)

Netizens have questioned the CCP’s self-acting ""bitter plan"" and ridiculed the Ta Kung Pao ""predicting the future"" and ""a Nobel Prize."" Some netizens ridiculed that He Junyi ""the hospitalization of the assassination last night"" was ""through time and space"" and ""has recovered and discharged from hospital last week.""
The NTD reporter asked the Ta Kung Pao page to find that the page had not been updated for more than a week before the release of the ""He Junyi assassination"" post. The last post was still on October 28. At 7:54 pm on the evening of November 5, Hong Kong time (6:54 am on the 5th, US Eastern Time), the page was published in an intensive update, and at least 8 articles have been released so far. The post follows the ""He Junyi incident.""
While actively following up on ""He Junyi's assassination"", the page also began to be intensively posted to publicize the order of Beijing's top executives to ask Hong Kong Shoulin Zheng Yuexi to ""stop the evil"", which coincides with the hype ""He Junyi assassination"".
Some people on the Internet argued that Facebook’s display of Ta Kung Pao’s posting on the evening of May 5 may be “the time of the Facebook system is wrong”. However, this reporter found that the Ta Kung Pao page was intensively updated after the post, and the subsequent posts did not show signs of ""time disorder."" In addition, the post was followed by the words ""Today (6th)"" or ""This morning"" in the post of ""He Junyi assassination"". The post on the 5th night did not indicate ""Today"". Instead, use the past tense ""the day."" Therefore, netizens also generally questioned that this post was not released on the 6th.
Dagong.com issued a document on its website that night, and firmly denied that it posted in advance on the evening of the 5th, and claimed that the newspaper received the video of He Junyi at 11:43 on the 6th, ""posted at 11:54,"" but then his Facebook account Suspected to be invaded, the posting time of the post was ""tampered to 7:54 on the 5th.""
However, Twitter users who have a better understanding of Facebook's operation assert that the posting time of this post has not been modified, because the function of Facebook's modification of posting time cannot be accurate to one-digit minutes. The reason for the early posting of the post was that it was very likely that Ta Kung Pao pre-published the text on the evening of the 5th, but set the post to a hidden state and publicly released the next day, thus retaining the original time of post posting. The conclusion is that the attack must have been premeditated, and the Ta Kung Pao was informed beforehand.



To this end, our reporter interviewed a senior FB community media editor working in the US media. She said that she has been doing FB editing for many years. Sometimes she posts dozens of posts a day, and some posts are sent out immediately. Some posts write the content first, and preset it to be published at some time in the future. She has never encountered a situation where the post shows that the time is different from the actual post time. Although FB often has some bugs, I have not encountered such an error.
The editor believes that the above tweet analysis makes sense. It is likely that the Ta Kung Pao editor wrote the post in advance on the evening of the 5th, but first set it to the hidden state until it was made public on the 6th.
In fact, as early as the pro-communist media released the live video of the so-called ""He Junyi assassination"", it has already caused doubts. The netizens raised five major doubts, including filming in one go, from flowering to action, and there were people's records; He Junyi's dodge response was too fast, and it was beyond ordinary people; many people, such as the assistant group, immediately joined forces to suppress the perpetrators, and the performance was abnormal; the uniformed attackers also There is no fierce struggle; it is not reasonable to choose a murder in the downtown area.

The following is a live video of ""He Junyi's Assassination"" published by the Ta Kung Pao Facebook page:




Since the anti-send campaign, He Jun’s words and deeds have provoked the indignation of the people of Hong Kong, including comparing the protesters to blasphemy, repeatedly threatening to violently treat the protesters, and shaking hands with the whites in the 7.21 bloody Yuen Long incident. He Junxi was also dug out of the CCP’s underground party membership and was recently dismissed by the British Anglia Ruskin University.
