      <p>Even Nicholas Sparks couldn’t write chemistry this good. Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet were made to play love interests, even if their love is always unrequited (word to alleged truth-teller <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/timothee-chalamet-bbc-radio-1-video.html">Kyle Schieble</a>). In a clip from their new movie, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/little-women-greta-gerwig-photos.html">Greta Gerwig’s <i>Little Women</i></a>, Saoirse Ronan is the playful Jo, relegated to a corner after setting her dress on fire. Chalamet plays Laurie, who looks at her, burnt dress and all, like she’s the first <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/call-me-by-your-name-book-club-part-two-the-peach-scene.html">peach</a> of the season: precious and impossible. And there’s only one thing to do when two people are sitting on a couch, away from the chaos of a party … they go outside and dance! The dancing quickly devolves into crazed hopping, but it’s <i>their</i> crazed hopping. Too bad it can’t last forever — Jo’s got a book to write.</p>
