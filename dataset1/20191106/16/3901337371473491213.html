      <p>It was also first predicted by the Siya crew that City were keen on bringing on board a Dutch tactician, this after they parted ways with Head Coach Benni McCarthy at midnight on Sunday.</p>
      <p>While Muhsin Ertugral and Cavin Johnson were initially all linked to the vacant position, Siya sources thereafter revealed that club chairman, John Comitis was keen on bringing in someone with a Dutch philosophy of football.Â </p>
      <p>The club confirmed on their official Twitter account, "Another era of excellence begins. <br/>"I'm really proud to be back here, and I'm really proud to coach this team."</p>
