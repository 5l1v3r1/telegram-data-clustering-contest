      <p>Dutch authorities swarmed Amsterdam's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/hong-kong-international-airport-resumes-flights-night-violence/story?id=64963143">largest airport</a> on Wednesday likely fearing the worst, only to discover that a jet's warning trigger had been pressed accidentally.</p>
      <p>Air Europa confirmed via Twitter, after all crew and passengers had been evacuated from the Madrid-bound flight at Schiphol airport, that an alarm had been activated "by mistake."</p>
