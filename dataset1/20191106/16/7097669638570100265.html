      <p>WASHINGTON – Forty percent of registered voters approve of the job President Donald Trump is doing in office, but more than half of them expect him to win reelection, according to a<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/06/donald-trump-2020-election-poll-066158"> Politico-Morning Consult poll </a>released Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Overall, 56% of voters say it is likely Trump will win a second term – 27% say it is "very likely" and 29% say it is "somewhat likely." </p>
      <p>The prospect of four more years of a Trump presidency has energized voters in both parties: 70% of respondents say they are "absolutely certain to vote" in their primary or caucus, and 14% say they are "very likely" to vote. Eighty-one percent say they are "very likely" to vote in the general election, and 11% say they are "somewhat likely" to vote. </p>
      <p>Sixty percent say Trump will be on their mind when they cast their ballot; 41% say they will be thinking about him "a lot." </p>

      <p>"President Trump’s reelection prospects seem to be energizing voter enthusiasm across the political spectrum," Morning Consult’s Vice President Tyler Sinclair says.
