Each gong is expected to fetch up to £4,600 (6,000 dollars) while the white ensemble Day wore to accept the Cecil B DeMille prize in 1989 could take £2,300 (3,000 dollars).
Day died at her home in Carmel Valley, California, on May 13 aged 97, after a serious case of pneumonia.
A collection of her possessions is being sold by Julien’s Auctions, with proceeds going to the Doris Day Animal Foundation, founded by the star in 1978.
