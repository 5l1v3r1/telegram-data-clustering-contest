      <p>Serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson has reportedly appointed bankers to explore a sale of Gail’s Bakery.</p>
      <p>Johnson has appointed bankers at Nomura to oversee the sale of Gail’s parent company Bread Holdings, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>A sale process is expected to be launched in the next few months with a price tag of £150m, the report said.</p>

      <p>Gail’s opened its first branch in Hampstead in 2005 and it now has 50 bakeries in and around London.</p>
      <p>Johnson has had a tough year following the discovery of a multi-million pound black hole in the accounts of cake-chain Patisserie Valerie where he was executive chairman.</p>
      <p>The business crashed into administration in February despite Johnson’s provision of £10m in emergency funding.</p>

      <p>The Serious Fraud Office has launched a probe into the chain and the audit watchdog is investigating its auditor Grant Thornton.</p>
      <p>Johnson has previously backed chains such as Pizza Express, Strada and Giraffe.</p>
      <p>Last month another company he is an investor in, Elegant Hotels, agreed to a £101m takeover by Marriott International.</p>
      <p>Nomura and Gail’s declined to comment.</p>
