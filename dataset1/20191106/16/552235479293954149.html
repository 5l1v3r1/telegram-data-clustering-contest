      <h2>Action Old Kilpatrick were given an award for their outstanding work by Keep Scotland Beautiful.</h2>

      <p>The Wombles had a reputation for battling litter louts – but now a community group has been handed an accolade for their efforts to spruce up the streets.</p>
      <p>But rather than tidy Wimbledon Common, members of Action Old Kilpatrick are dedicated to keeping the village spick and span.</p>
      <p>Their efforts have been recognised after they landed an award in the outstanding category from environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The It’s Your Neighbourhood gong is designed to celebrate those who improve the community.</p>
      <p>They were amongst more than 160 groups handed awards for their commitment to cleaning up, at a ceremony in Stirling.</p>
      <p>A host of community initiatives from school wildlife clubs to allotment societies, were recognised at the event.</p>
      <p>Winners received a graded certificate for their achievements.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Katie Murray, communities and place manager from Keep Scotland Beautiful, said: “Every It’s Your Neighbourhood participant deserves this recognition for their hard work and determination to improve their own community.</p>
      <p>“By volunteering their own time the 2019 groups have managed to support hundreds of environmental initiatives across Scotland.</p>
      <p>“I would like to offer my congratulations to all of the groups involved. I hope that their enthusiasm inspires many more people to take part in helping to improve their local community in 2020.”</p>
      <p>The awards scheme is run by the charity in conjunction with the Royal Horticultural Society.</p>
