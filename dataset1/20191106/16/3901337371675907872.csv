Despite their precarious position on the Absa Premiership log, Baroka FC seem to be oozing with confidence ahead of tonight’s match against Mamelodi Sundowns.

Baroka are in 14th place on the log with only eight points out of a possible 27. The team’s head coach Wedson Nyirenda has been linked with an exit in recent weeks, due to the poor run of form.
Despite all of that, there is a celebration currently underway at the Limpopo outfit, with the club ecstatic about playing their 100th match in Mzansi’s top-flight, since their promotion in 2016 under charismatic coach Kgoloko Thobejane.

In other news for the club, after the recent signing of former Ajax Cape Town and Bidvest Wits striker Prince Nxumalo, the Limpopo outfit has replaced Mduduzi Mdantsane as the team’s captain with Gerald Phiri Junior. 
Meanwhile, Downs still have a number of players currently with injuries – with the likes of Oupa Manyisa, Anthony Laffor, Lucky Mohomi, Emiliano Tade, Themba Zwane, Phakamani Mahlambi and Gaston Sirino all expected to miss the Baroka match.
