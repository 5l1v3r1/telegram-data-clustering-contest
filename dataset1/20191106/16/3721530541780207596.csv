Is there anything better than a crush?
No.
Luckily, the past decade has been particularly ripe with crushes, keeping the flames of our hearts stoked as we made our way through the modern world. To celebrate them — and the act of crushing in general — we’ve compiled the 69 biggest crushes we’ve had over the past 10 years.
Whether you’re into sweet men trying to navigate the zombie apocalypse, or strong Greek assassins who are incredibly good at flirting, or space dads, our list (like your crushes!!!) has it all.


Damn fineShowtime

Agent Dale Cooper
The return of Twin Peaks was, all told, one of the best things that ever happened to me, and the return of Dale Cooper specifically was a blessing. He is still absolutely beautiful, if now even more of a tragic hero. —Karen Han


Akali, obviouslyRiot Games

Akali (League of Legends)
Sick dragon back tat? Check. K-pop star voiced by the fabulous Soyeon of (G)i-dle? Check. Will annihilate me in lane and walk away like it’s nothing? Check, check, check. —Julia Lee



Amber Gray as Persephone in Hadestown
She’s MY Lady of the Underground. —Petrana Radulovic


One of the dreamiest faces we’ve ever seen.Sony Pictures Releasing International

Antonio Banderas
This may be a cheat since we’ve all had a crush on Antonio Banderas for years now (whether its originating point was Zorro or Spy Kids or Interview with the Vampire), but we’re dubbing 2019 the return of Banderas as a major crush with Pain and Glory. Plus, the GIF of him in Assassins — the one where he’s leaning back from a laptop — was apparently born in 2013, so case closed. —KH


The song of the summer is Ben Mendelsohn in Bloodline.Netflix

Ben Mendelsohn in Bloodline
I have tricked convinced several of my friends into watching Netflix’s Bloodline simply by telling them Ben Mendelsohn is in it. The series, of which I maintain the first season is actually genuinely good, contains the Mendelsohn performance which is possibly the purest distillation of his appeal, i.e. as a terrible, sweaty, itinerant boyfriend. See also: him showing up with a cigar and a giant fur coat in Slow West. —KH


I love Ben Wyatt as much as he loves calzones.NBC Universal

Ben Wyatt of Parks and Rec
Ben Wyatt loves and respects his wife’s ambitions while maintaining his own interests and without becoming a wife guy. His only flaw is not loving Little Sebastian. 9/10 we stan a supportive king. —Emily Heller


Just look at that hair. That confidence.BBC

Bertie Carvel as Jonathan Strange
The Byronic hero we need and deserve. (And, yes, the BBC adaptation of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell is one of the best shows of the last decade.) —KH


Gruff voice, dead wife, strong jaw. That’s my shit.Obsidian Entertainment/Bethesda Softworks

Boone in Fallout: New Vegas
Oh hey it’s another dysfunctional dude! Craig Boone seems like the strong and silent type, but don’t worry: if you pick at the surface, you’ll find a tragic backstory and poignant doubts about the new rise of American democracy stretching out across the post-apocalypse West Coast. Plus he’s got a big ol’ jaw and a sick set of shades paired with a cool ass beret.
You can’t romance Boone, but I brought him anywhere I went in Fallout: New Vegas. It didn’t matter whether I was going into a cave of Deathclaws or the heart of the Caesar’s Legion warcamp — I trusted him to have my back.
And sure enough, when we fought our way out of Legion territory covered in the blood of Caesar, I felt like I had bonded with Boone on a deep level. In my mind, he and my Courier totally ran away together. —Cass Marshall


The ballad of how much I love Buster Scruggs.Netflix

Buster Scruggs
Watching Tim Blake Nelson, in a lovely cream cowboy outfit, sweetly sing his way through the desert and then shoot a bunch of men to death is the happiest I’ve ever been. That’s yeehaw culture. —KH


It must be said that the cartoon man is hot.Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures

Cartoon Bob Odenkirk in The Incredibles 2
Is he the hottest cartoon character since the Robin Hood fox? Yes. Taking no further questions at this time. —KH


Chris Pratt could neverNetflix

Chris Pine
Of the Four Hot Chrises of Hollywood, Pine is the supreme. Don’t @ me. —EH



Chrom from Fire Emblem Awakening
I would add more Fire Emblem characters to this list, but I have to give Chrom the title here for stealing my heart so fully. Chrom is just a good guy. He’s trying. He has a bit of a temper, but he wants what’s best for his people. He’s princely, noble, kinda dumb, really pretty, and is voiced by Matt Mercer, so really what else could you want? I have told my partner multiple times that the only person I’d ever leave him for is Chrom. —PR


Take a closer look at that stache!A24

Colin Farrell with a mustache
Okay, maybe the one thing I love more is when actors grow weird facial hair, e.g. Colin Farrell in The Lobster. I love to see it. Honorable mention for Tom Holland’s tiny mustache in The Lost City of Z, Jude Law’s crazy mutton chops in Dom Hemingway, and Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger (yes, he’s terrible; yes, I still love him; yes, I’m sorry). —KH


Nice turtleneck.NBC Universal

Criss Chros from 30 Rock
The first time I watched an episode of 30 Rock I wanted Liz and Jack to kiss, but in my defense I was 13. By the time James Marsden showed up as the perfect sweet dummy for Liz, I had grown into an adult bisexual who knows a crush-worthy himbo when she sees one. —EH


HiBioWare

Cullen from Dragon Age
Alistair in Dragon Age: Origins was one of the best video game romances of all time, so BioWare wisely put another handsome dumbass Templar in my party and let me smooch him.
Cullen is a big, strong dude who wears a giant fur stole and is ripped. He’s struggling with a magic drug addiction. It’s probably a workplace violation, because I’m technically his boss, but I romanced him anyways. I love his strong jaw and his big shoulders and I will not apologize for any of this. —CM
Inquisition was the first Dragon Age game I played and my type in video games (see: Chrom) is strong, capable dude who gets really flustered if you tell him you want to listen to him lecture more. —PR


We love a man who can follow a woman’s lead.20th Century Fox

Danny McBride in Alien: Covenant
When I saw that Danny McBride (whose status as a crush icon has been cemented by Eastbound & Down, Vice Principals, The Righteous Gemstones, and so many other genius works of comedy) had been cast in Alien: Covenant, I was positive he’d die within the first 30 minutes. Spoilers: he does not! He makes it all the way through to the end! Did I want him and Katherine Waterston to kiss? I didn’t not want that! —KH


Yes, I prefer the Ninth Doctor don’t @ meThe CW and BBC via Polygon

Dean Winchester (Supernatural)/Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock)/The Doctor (Doctor Who)
Don’t judge me, it was the height of Superwholock-era Tumblr. —EH


“Jabba, c’mon, touching his belly [growls]”Lucasfilm

Diego Luna as Cassian Andor in Rogue One
The accent ... the jacket ... the sensitive look in his eyes. I was happy that Felicity Jones’ Jyn Erso didn’t have a love interest, following in a new line of Star Wars heroines that don’t die of sadness, but by the time that elevator scene came around, I was screaming NOW KISS. —PR



Elsa from Frozen
That moment in “Let it Go” when she lets her hair down, changes into her ice dress, and does that little shimmy … —PR


J. Smith Cameron run me over with a bus, please.Peter Kramer/HBO

The entire cast of Succession
If loving pasty, terrible people is wrong (it is), I don’t want to be right. —EH


They’re all hot!!!Marvel Studios

Everyone in every Marvel movie
They’re all impossibly hot. —EH


The Circus at work.StudioCanal

Everybody in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
They’re all wracked with angst and they’re all at least a little in love with each other. —KH


2019 is the year we admit we absolutely love monsters.Jonathan Hession/Showtime

Frankenstein’s monster on Penny Dreadful
Rory Kinnear is always great, but perhaps never as great as he is as Frankenstein’s monster. He just wants to be loved! Come on! —KH


This sweatshirt/glasses combo is *chef’s kiss*Universal Pictures

Gabe from Us
After capturing everyone’s attention as the MCU’s broody and thicc M’Baku, Winston Duke rocketed to the top of my crush list when he reached peak Hot Dad in Us. —EH


Gotta love Steven Yeun.AMC

Glenn from The Walking Dead
I understand that this is irrational, but I will forever hold a grudge against The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman, showrunner Scott M. Gimple, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, the actor who played Negan, for Glenn’s death. We’ll never forget his glow-up from shy cutie to Hot Dad, before he was cruelly taken from us by with a bat wrapped in barbed wire. —EH



Greg Universe from Steven Universe
Greg is a good dad, with a luscious and decadent singing voice and luscious and decadent hair. —PR


I choose youThe Pokémon Company

Grimsley from Pokémon
Grimsley was already hot in Pokémon Black and White but when he came through with the white streak in his hair in Sun and Moon, something dark awakened in me. I could really get into it here, talking about his gambling habits and skills with sleight of hand as well, but just look at him. He’s HOT. —JL


Choco-whoaSquare Enix via Polygon

Hien Rijin from Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood
A prince, who’s frickin’ ripped and also hot. To quote one of Polygon’s own, he’s a “major himbo with a ‘nice jock’ energy.” He also likes mushrooms to a point where he’ll eat random ones off the ground and then proceed to almost die due to the effects. Thank you, Hien. —JL


Free ... to play ...Pixelberry

Jake Mackenzie from Choices: Stories You Play’s “Endless Summer”
A pilot with great hair, a cool jacket, and a tragique backstory spells everything that normally checks off my boxes but a few details bump Jake up on this list for me. He’s a Bi icon since you can romance him with a male or female main character and he’s 5’9 (in boots). Short kings, rise up! —PR


There’s nothing I love more than a mean mom with a knife strapped to her hipUniversal Pictures

Jamie Lee Curtis
Upon seeing Jamie Lee Curtis kick ass in Halloween (2018), I realized that I had been nursing a latent crush on her for 15 years, ever since she flirted with Chad Michael Murray in Freaky Friday. —EH


He’s got kind eyes.Warner Bros. Studios

Jason Mantzoukas
Every Jason Mantzoukas performance has a powerful chaotic energy that I am inexorably drawn to, from The Good Place’s Derek to his Comedy Bang! Bang! meta-character Jeffrey Characterwheaties. The fact that Mantzoukas is, by all accounts, a total sweetie, makes me feel better about crushing on nightmares like Parks and Rec’s trashy mens fragrance mogul, Dennis Feinstein. —EH


The platonic ideal of a himbo.Colleen Hayes/NBC

Jason Mendoza (The Good Place)
Pretty of face, gold of heart, and absolutely dumb of ass. As a fellow Floridian, I must stan. —PR



Jason Statham in Spy
Praise be a man willing to make fun of his uber-macho image. —KH



Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst
They are the one celeb couple who make me believe in love. —KH


A nice man who has never done anything wrong.Lionsgate

John Wick
He loves dogs. —KH


Pair with a cold brewBandai Namco

Kaede Takagaki from Idolmaster: Cinderella Girls
I have a lot of Idolmaster characters who I see as my precious daughters, who I want to see grow big and healthy. Not Kaede. I want to go out all night with Kaede, slamming down beers. At the end of the night, we will kiss and she will be the mature anime girlfriend I’ve always wanted. —JL


I wish I were that knife.Ubisoft Quebec/Polygon

Kassandra from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
So Kassandra, although you, being far away, forget us, the dear sound of your footstep and light glancing in your eyes would move me more than glitter of Lydian horse or armored tread of mainland infantry. —Sappho, paraphrased by Jenna Stoeber



Whoever Kate McKinnon played in Ghostbusters
Look, I don’t even remember her name, [Ed. note: It’s Holtzmann.] I just remember her licking her gun and going Wow in the theater. —PR


Yes, sirWonderStorm

King Harrow from The Dragon Prince
To paraphrase a friend of mine: “I just said wow hello when a CARTOON character was introduced — that’s how hot he was.” —PR


She’s a legit snack.NBC Universal

Kristen Bell
Kristen has never strayed far from my mind since Veronica Mars aired, but between Frozen (a movie I still love) and The Good Place, she’s been particularly spectacular this past 10 years. She gives off an aura of both hardworking and super chill and that’s what I want to invite into my life, maybe over a cup of coffee sometime, pls dm me Kristen. —JS


The leopard print! The loafers! The confused expression!Chiabella James/Sony Pictures Entertainment

Kristen Stewart
The fourth Twilight movie was released in 2011, freeing Kristen Stewart to spend the following 9 years transforming herself into a gay icon. Judging by how many women on my Twitter feed thirsted over the Charlie’s Angels trailer, she has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. —EH


The only musical group from the last decade that matters.Universal Pictures

The Lonely Island
Between MacGruber and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping — plus the individual members of The Lonely Island showing up in a lot of the greatest comedy of the last decade — they have our hearts forever. —KH



Magic Mike XXL
Do I ... really need to say anything else? —KH


DADS.Universal Pictures

The Mamma Mia! Dads / Lily James as Donna Sheridan in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
If you need a pure shot of serotonin, here’s where to go: the scene in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again where Colin Firth holds Stellan Skarsgård like they’re in Titanic, and then everything after that, including Firth, Skarsgård, and Pierce Brosnan sporting skintight disco suits. —KH


abbabababbabbababbabbabaPlaytone / Littlestar / Productions Legendary Entertainment

I liked Lily James in Cinderella. But seeing her dance through the Greek countryside in overalls, charming every person she meets, and singing her heart out no matter how low she gets, well, it won me over for real. —PR


The scheming, smirking queen of my heart.Helen Sloan/courtesy of HBO

Margaery Tyrell (Game of Thrones)
Witty: checkProgressive: checkGood with kids: checkCould absolutely kill me just by looking at me: check —EH



Specifically Michael Palin’s travel diaries
There is not a man on this Earth purer than Michael Palin, and his travel diaries are all the proof you need of that. He’s genuinely, earnestly interested in the places he goes, and the people he meets. —KH



Michael Shannon
I have never seen my entire workplace enter into as intense a fit of delirium as they did when Michael Shannon’s Bon Appetit video came out. We all love big Mike. —KH


Fuck me up, Moira.Blizzard Entertainment

Moira from Overwatch
I want Moira to step on me. She would probably drain all of my blood and use it for terrifying shadow science. She’s like if David Bowie and an evil wizard were mixed up in a The Fly machine and had a sociopath baby. Please destroy me, Moira. —CM


Me when I see Mothra.Warner Bros. Pictures

Mothra
She’s big, beautiful, confident, selfless, and most importantly, she is innocent. —KH


There’s no topping these two grumps.Fox Broadcasting Company via Polygon

Nick Miller from New Girl and Danny Castellano from The Mindy Project
The two grumpy hunks that stole my heart circa 2012 are the pinnacle of their respective forms. Chris Messina perfected the sweetheart with a prickly exterior and Jake Johnson is the platonic ideal of a lovable schlub. Let’s all agree to stop writing these types of characters now. —EH


The fashion choices alone.....Channel 4 via Polygon

Noel Fielding/Richard Ayoade/Russell Brand
I discovered British panel shows my senior year of high school, and was immediately obsessed with these three weirdos. I followed Richard Ayoade to The IT Crowd and Russell Brand to his marriage to Katy Perry but I’d never have guessed that in 2019 the one I’d still be crushing on is Noel Fielding as he judged the latest season of The Great British Baking Show. —EH


Aged like a fine wine!Ben Rothstein/Fox

Old Logan
Honestly, “beloved character but make them old” works on me every time. —KH


My spider-crush sense is tinglingSony Pictures Animation

Peter B. Parker from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Peter B. Parker is a mess. He’s got a dad bod, he’s greying, he has Jake Johnson’s incredibly sexy scruffy voice. He wears sweatpants. He’s in an absolute slump, and I love him. —PR


I love my two space dads.Lucasfilm/Disney

Poe Dameron and Finn
Let them kiss in The Rise of Skywalker, you cowards. —EH



Ralph Fiennes dancing in A Bigger Splash
Ralph Fiennes has gotten to the point in his career where he just does whatever he wants and the dividends have been incredible. —KH


Ok but seriously, nice turtleneck.NBC Universal

Rosa from Brooklyn Nine-Nine
I wish I had a bisexual icon like Rosa on TV when I was growing up. Her sexuailty is treated with such care and grace (thanks in large part to actress Stephanie Beatriz) that I cried a lot when Rosa came out to her friends. Also, she’s a dang snack. —EH


Rugged Mockingjay lookLionsgate

Finnick Odair in Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Mockingjay
I was 18 when Catching Fire came out and Finnick Odair was already my favorite book character. Sam Claflin earned a poster on my wall, a staple of my multiple dorm and apartment room transitions all through college. Finnick fulfills one of my favorite character tropes: the ladykiller ... in LOVE. Plus his hair is great. —PR


Michael Stuhlbarg be my dad, please.Sony Pictures Classics

Sensitive Michael Stuhlbarg in Men in Black 3/Call Me By Your Name/The Shape of Water
If watched any of the three above movies and didn’t wish, for even just a moment, that Michael Stuhlbarg would hold your hand, look deep into your eyes, and tell you everything is going to be alright, you are lying to yourself. —KH


Please, I’m begging you, watch Logan Lucky.Bleecker Street

Southern Daniel Craig
As Daniel Craig labors to get away from being James Bond, he’s taken a couple of trips into southern accent territory with Logan Lucky and Knives Out. Both performances have been … lovely. Drawl to me all day, DC. —KH


He’s not a loser.Joan Marcus

Squidward in the SpongeBob musical
He’s a tall, artistically ambitious sea creature who plays the clarinet. What’s not to like? Less facetiously, I have never had an emotional reaction to a moment in theatre as keen as the one I had during Squidward’s big number in the SpongeBob SquarePants Broadway show, and I have had a giant crush on Gavin Lee for years, so the SpongeBob musical was really a perfect storm. —KH


Those arms, though!Sony Pictures Classics

Swole J.K. Simmons
[ Me looking at J.K. Simmons normally: ] Oh.[ Me looking at two J.K. Simmonses in Counterpart: ] Oh![ Me looking at J.K. Simmons with his huge arms in Whiplash: ] Oh. —KH


Press F to pay respectsDisney

Tadashi from Big Hero 6
Smart, a good brother, great taste in cardigans, and ... smokin’ hot. (Because he, uh, dies in a fire.) —PR


That’s a dapper demon, I tell you what.NBC

Ted Danson on The Good Place
I love one (1) demon. —KH


Sometimes you just have to accept that all your loves will die terrible, icy deaths.AMC

The cast of The Terror
I’m sorry for putting yet another cadre of old men onto this list (I’m not sorry) but there really is a crush in The Terror for everyone. Company man? John Franklin. Long-suffering saint? Francis Crozier. Seemingly shallow but surprisingly deep protege? James Fitzjames. Personification of the Hippocratic Oath? Harry Goodsir. Chaotic evil? Cornelius Hickey. Possibly magical creature? Tuunbaq. This show’s got it all. —KH



2010s era They Might Be Giants
They Might Be Giants has been around for a while, but they’ve earned a place on this list for having put out no less than 9 studio albums over the course of the decade. (Haven’t listened to I Like Fun yet? What’s stopping you?) They’re my favorite dreamy music men and I will have a crush on them forever. Johns Flansburgh and Linnell, this one’s for you. —KH


Yes. Yes! Keep meditating on the nature of evil. Yeah!!Wonderstorm/Bardel Entertainment Inc.

Viren from The Dragon Prince
Viren is the antagonist of a children’s show, but this dude isn’t a hammy Skeletor. Viren is an absolute trash disaster who’s desperately trying to lay down track quick enough for his bad plans train. While he starts in a sympathetic place, he immediately starts snowballing under the pressure of living in a fantasy world on the brink of war. Before long, he’s making worse and worse decisions. Highly relatable. Highly cute. —CM


God tierAndrew Hussie/What Pumpkin

Vriska Serket (Homestuck)
Vriska did nothing wrong. —JL


America’s sweetheart Walton Goggins.Fox

Walton Goggins
Our national crush on Walton Goggins has been years in the making, and this decade has finally seen one of our most beautiful flowers come into full bloom. Whether he’s trying to stop Lara Croft, clogging for Jesus, or playing the most chaotic vice principal of all time, his perfect teeth and billboard forehead demand love. The Unicorn — you know, the show where he plays a dad everyone wants to get with — is just the universe’s way of showing us that we’ve been right all this time. —KH


Terrible wig, terrible accent, terrible character — we love it.Netflix

Weird Robert Pattinson
There is nothing I love more than when actors go totally balls to the wall, which is exactly what Robert Pattinson has done over the course of the last decade. Just look at what he’s doing in The King. Also in this category: Weird Jake Gyllenhaal (see: Okja, Nightcrawler, Velvet Buzzsaw, and even Spider-Man: Far From Home). —KH

A pilot with great hair, a cool jacket, and a tragique backstory spells everything that normally checks off my boxes but a few details bump Jake up on this list for me. He’s a Bi icon since you can romance him with a male or female main character and he’s 5’9 (in boots). Short kings, rise up! —PR


There’s nothing I love more than a mean mom with a knife strapped to her hipUniversal Pictures

Jamie Lee Curtis
Upon seeing Jamie Lee Curtis kick ass in Halloween (2018), I realized that I had been nursing a latent crush on her for 15 years, ever since she flirted with Chad Michael Murray in Freaky Friday. —EH


He’s got kind eyes.Warner Bros. Studios

Jason Mantzoukas
Every Jason Mantzoukas performance has a powerful chaotic energy that I am inexorably drawn to, from The Good Place’s Derek to his Comedy Bang! Bang! meta-character Jeffrey Characterwheaties. The fact that Mantzoukas is, by all accounts, a total sweetie, makes me feel better about crushing on nightmares like Parks and Rec’s trashy mens fragrance mogul, Dennis Feinstein. —EH


The platonic ideal of a himbo.Colleen Hayes/NBC

Jason Mendoza (The Good Place)
Pretty of face, gold of heart, and absolutely dumb of ass. As a fellow Floridian, I must stan. —PR



Jason Statham in Spy
Praise be a man willing to make fun of his uber-macho image. —KH



Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst
They are the one celeb couple who make me believe in love. —KH


A nice man who has never done anything wrong.Lionsgate

John Wick
He loves dogs. —KH


Pair with a cold brewBandai Namco

Kaede Takagaki from Idolmaster: Cinderella Girls
I have a lot of Idolmaster characters who I see as my precious daughters, who I want to see grow big and healthy. Not Kaede. I want to go out all night with Kaede, slamming down beers. At the end of the night, we will kiss and she will be the mature anime girlfriend I’ve always wanted. —JL


I wish I were that knife.Ubisoft Quebec/Polygon

Kassandra from Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
So Kassandra, although you, being far away, forget us, the dear sound of your footstep and light glancing in your eyes would move me more than glitter of Lydian horse or armored tread of mainland infantry. —Sappho, paraphrased by Jenna Stoeber



Whoever Kate McKinnon played in Ghostbusters
Look, I don’t even remember her name, [Ed. note: It’s Holtzmann.] I just remember her licking her gun and going Wow in the theater. —PR


Yes, sirWonderStorm

King Harrow from The Dragon Prince
To paraphrase a friend of mine: “I just said wow hello when a CARTOON character was introduced — that’s how hot he was.” —PR


She’s a legit snack.NBC Universal

Kristen Bell
Kristen has never strayed far from my mind since Veronica Mars aired, but between Frozen (a movie I still love) and The Good Place, she’s been particularly spectacular this past 10 years. She gives off an aura of both hardworking and super chill and that’s what I want to invite into my life, maybe over a cup of coffee sometime, pls dm me Kristen. —JS


The leopard print! The loafers! The confused expression!Chiabella James/Sony Pictures Entertainment

Kristen Stewart
The fourth Twilight movie was released in 2011, freeing Kristen Stewart to spend the following 9 years transforming herself into a gay icon. Judging by how many women on my Twitter feed thirsted over the Charlie’s Angels trailer, she has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. —EH


The only musical group from the last decade that matters.Universal Pictures

The Lonely Island
Between MacGruber and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping — plus the individual members of The Lonely Island showing up in a lot of the greatest comedy of the last decade — they have our hearts forever. —KH



Magic Mike XXL
Do I ... really need to say anything else? —KH


DADS.Universal Pictures

The Mamma Mia! Dads / Lily James as Donna Sheridan in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again
If you need a pure shot of serotonin, here’s where to go: the scene in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again where Colin Firth holds Stellan Skarsgård like they’re in Titanic, and then everything after that, including Firth, Skarsgård, and Pierce Brosnan sporting skintight disco suits. —KH


abbabababbabbababbabbabaPlaytone / Littlestar / Productions Legendary Entertainment

I liked Lily James in Cinderella. But seeing her dance through the Greek countryside in overalls, charming every person she meets, and singing her heart out no matter how low she gets, well, it won me over for real. —PR


The scheming, smirking queen of my heart.Helen Sloan/courtesy of HBO

Margaery Tyrell (Game of Thrones)
Witty: checkProgressive: checkGood with kids: checkCould absolutely kill me just by looking at me: check —EH



Specifically Michael Palin’s travel diaries
There is not a man on this Earth purer than Michael Palin, and his travel diaries are all the proof you need of that. He’s genuinely, earnestly interested in the places he goes, and the people he meets. —KH



Michael Shannon
I have never seen my entire workplace enter into as intense a fit of delirium as they did when Michael Shannon’s Bon Appetit video came out. We all love big Mike. —KH


Fuck me up, Moira.Blizzard Entertainment

Moira from Overwatch
I want Moira to step on me. She would probably drain all of my blood and use it for terrifying shadow science. She’s like if David Bowie and an evil wizard were mixed up in a The Fly machine and had a sociopath baby. Please destroy me, Moira. —CM


Me when I see Mothra.Warner Bros. Pictures

Mothra
She’s big, beautiful, confident, selfless, and most importantly, she is innocent. —KH


There’s no topping these two grumps.Fox Broadcasting Company via Polygon

Nick Miller from New Girl and Danny Castellano from The Mindy Project
The two grumpy hunks that stole my heart circa 2012 are the pinnacle of their respective forms. Chris Messina perfected the sweetheart with a prickly exterior and Jake Johnson is the platonic ideal of a lovable schlub. Let’s all agree to stop writing these types of characters now. —EH


The fashion choices alone.....Channel 4 via Polygon

Noel Fielding/Richard Ayoade/Russell Brand
I discovered British panel shows my senior year of high school, and was immediately obsessed with these three weirdos. I followed Richard Ayoade to The IT Crowd and Russell Brand to his marriage to Katy Perry but I’d never have guessed that in 2019 the one I’d still be crushing on is Noel Fielding as he judged the latest season of The Great British Baking Show. —EH


Aged like a fine wine!Ben Rothstein/Fox

Old Logan
Honestly, “beloved character but make them old” works on me every time. —KH


My spider-crush sense is tinglingSony Pictures Animation

Peter B. Parker from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
Peter B. Parker is a mess. He’s got a dad bod, he’s greying, he has Jake Johnson’s incredibly sexy scruffy voice. He wears sweatpants. He’s in an absolute slump, and I love him. —PR


I love my two space dads.Lucasfilm/Disney

Poe Dameron and Finn
Let them kiss in The Rise of Skywalker, you cowards. —EH



Ralph Fiennes dancing in A Bigger Splash
Ralph Fiennes has gotten to the point in his career where he just does whatever he wants and the dividends have been incredible. —KH


Ok but seriously, nice turtleneck.NBC Universal

Rosa from Brooklyn Nine-Nine
I wish I had a bisexual icon like Rosa on TV when I was growing up. Her sexuailty is treated with such care and grace (thanks in large part to actress Stephanie Beatriz) that I cried a lot when Rosa came out to her friends. Also, she’s a dang snack. —EH


Rugged Mockingjay lookLionsgate

Finnick Odair in Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Mockingjay
I was 18 when Catching Fire came out and Finnick Odair was already my favorite book character. Sam Claflin earned a poster on my wall, a staple of my multiple dorm and apartment room transitions all through college. Finnick fulfills one of my favorite character tropes: the ladykiller ... in LOVE. Plus his hair is great. —PR


Michael Stuhlbarg be my dad, please.Sony Pictures Classics

Sensitive Michael Stuhlbarg in Men in Black 3/Call Me By Your Name/The Shape of Water
If watched any of the three above movies and didn’t wish, for even just a moment, that Michael Stuhlbarg would hold your hand, look deep into your eyes, and tell you everything is going to be alright, you are lying to yourself. —KH


Please, I’m begging you, watch Logan Lucky.Bleecker Street

Southern Daniel Craig
As Daniel Craig labors to get away from being James Bond, he’s taken a couple of trips into southern accent territory with Logan Lucky and Knives Out. Both performances have been … lovely. Drawl to me all day, DC. —KH


He’s not a loser.Joan Marcus

Squidward in the SpongeBob musical
He’s a tall, artistically ambitious sea creature who plays the clarinet. What’s not to like? Less facetiously, I have never had an emotional reaction to a moment in theatre as keen as the one I had during Squidward’s big number in the SpongeBob SquarePants Broadway show, and I have had a giant crush on Gavin Lee for years, so the SpongeBob musical was really a perfect storm. —KH


Those arms, though!Sony Pictures Classics

Swole J.K. Simmons
[ Me looking at J.K. Simmons normally: ] Oh.[ Me looking at two J.K. Simmonses in Counterpart: ] Oh![ Me looking at J.K. Simmons with his huge arms in Whiplash: ] Oh. —KH


Press F to pay respectsDisney

Tadashi from Big Hero 6
Smart, a good brother, great taste in cardigans, and ... smokin’ hot. (Because he, uh, dies in a fire.) —PR


That’s a dapper demon, I tell you what.NBC

Ted Danson on The Good Place
I love one (1) demon. —KH


Sometimes you just have to accept that all your loves will die terrible, icy deaths.AMC

The cast of The Terror
I’m sorry for putting yet another cadre of old men onto this list (I’m not sorry) but there really is a crush in The Terror for everyone. Company man? John Franklin. Long-suffering saint? Francis Crozier. Seemingly shallow but surprisingly deep protege? James Fitzjames. Personification of the Hippocratic Oath? Harry Goodsir. Chaotic evil? Cornelius Hickey. Possibly magical creature? Tuunbaq. This show’s got it all. —KH



2010s era They Might Be Giants
They Might Be Giants has been around for a while, but they’ve earned a place on this list for having put out no less than 9 studio albums over the course of the decade. (Haven’t listened to I Like Fun yet? What’s stopping you?) They’re my favorite dreamy music men and I will have a crush on them forever. Johns Flansburgh and Linnell, this one’s for you. —KH


Yes. Yes! Keep meditating on the nature of evil. Yeah!!Wonderstorm/Bardel Entertainment Inc.

Viren from The Dragon Prince
Viren is the antagonist of a children’s show, but this dude isn’t a hammy Skeletor. Viren is an absolute trash disaster who’s desperately trying to lay down track quick enough for his bad plans train. While he starts in a sympathetic place, he immediately starts snowballing under the pressure of living in a fantasy world on the brink of war. Before long, he’s making worse and worse decisions. Highly relatable. Highly cute. —CM


God tierAndrew Hussie/What Pumpkin

Vriska Serket (Homestuck)
Vriska did nothing wrong. —JL


America’s sweetheart Walton Goggins.Fox

Walton Goggins
Our national crush on Walton Goggins has been years in the making, and this decade has finally seen one of our most beautiful flowers come into full bloom. Whether he’s trying to stop Lara Croft, clogging for Jesus, or playing the most chaotic vice principal of all time, his perfect teeth and billboard forehead demand love. The Unicorn — you know, the show where he plays a dad everyone wants to get with — is just the universe’s way of showing us that we’ve been right all this time. —KH


Terrible wig, terrible accent, terrible character — we love it.Netflix

Weird Robert Pattinson
There is nothing I love more than when actors go totally balls to the wall, which is exactly what Robert Pattinson has done over the course of the last decade. Just look at what he’s doing in The King. Also in this category: Weird Jake Gyllenhaal (see: Okja, Nightcrawler, Velvet Buzzsaw, and even Spider-Man: Far From Home). —KH
