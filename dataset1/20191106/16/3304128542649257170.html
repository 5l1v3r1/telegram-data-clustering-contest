      <p>Foreign Correspondents’ Association of East Africa (FCAEA) representing journalists covering the region for foreign media organisations has rebuked the recent expulsion of two of its members from South Sudan.</p>
      <p>Six days ago, an Associated Press (AP) journalist Sam Mednick had her press accreditation revoked for six months, forcing her out of the country.</p>
      <p>The South Sudan government’s actions were in response to a story published by the Canadian journalist saying that tensions were rising in the capital ahead of the formation of a unity government.</p>

      <p>Mednick was accused of fabricating “misinformation intended to create panic and a fear of the unknown.”</p>
      <p>Before her departure, the AP journalist reported from South Sudan for close to three years.</p>
      <p>On November 3, a French journalist Bastien Renouil with France24 was detained upon arriving in Juba and held overnight under unclear circumstances.</p>

      <p>Mr Renouil was deported the next day even though he was in possession of a visa.</p>
      <p>The foreign correspondents’ body further noted an escalation in repression of press freedom something that is making it difficult for journalists to access the country for fear of intimidation.</p>
      <p>“We stand by our members and colleagues working for S Sudanese media, who regularly face intimidation and threats. We call on the international community, specifically the diplomatic community of South Sudan and East Africa, to prioritize press freedom,” a FCAEA statement read in part.</p>

      <p>Last week, a foreign body representing correspondents in Uganda condemned the government for arresting and intimidating journalists covering the Makerere University students’ tuition protest.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Kitata of Bukedde newspaper, Chris Ssemakula of BBS television and another believed to be a BBC correspondent were apprehended and driven to unknown destinations.</p>
      <p>A NBS journalist Canary Mugume also had his camera snatched while reporting live from the campus.</p>
      <p>A fortnight ago, FCAU said in a statement, at least 15 journalists were teargassed for providing coverage during a press conference called by student leaders. The reporters said police forced them to delete material of students with disabilities being arrested.</p>
