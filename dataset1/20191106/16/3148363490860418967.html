      <h1>White House Mocks ABC News 'Standards' Blocking Jeffery Epstein Story</h1>
      <h2>White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley on Wednesday ridiculed ABC News for their purported editorial standards that effectively shut down the story exposing Jefferey Epstein.</h2>

      <p>Gidley pointed out flawed ABC News reporting that rushed to judgment on conservatives despite not having the evidence.</p>
      <p>“For ABC to make the comment that it wasn’t up to our standards to put on television, I guess that doesn’t apply to Kavanaugh, I guess that doesn’t apply to Covington kids, I guess that doesn’t apply when you put up a video that and say ‘look at the shelling in Syria’ but it’s actually Kentucky,” Gidley said in an interview with Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart Editor in Chief Alex Marlow.</p>

      <p>Gidley also pointed to the so-called ABC News Brian Ross <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/07/02/brian-ross-resign-abc-news-mike-flynn/">bombshell </a>on the Russia report that actually shifted the stock markets before the news outlet had to walk back Ross’s reporting.</p>
      <p>“The desire of the media to getting it first, instead of getting right is shocking,” Gidley said.</p>
      <p>Journalists, he said, increasingly focused their efforts on “taking out Trump” to get praise from their colleagues and get promoted in their news organizations.</p>
      <p>“You want to succeed, you try to take down a president, facts or reporting or news reporting be damned,” Gidley said.</p>
      <p>He reminded journalists they were in a profession that required a level of responsibility and restraint that never appeared to apply to Republicans.</p>
      <p>“It’s an honorable profession, but it comes with great responsibility … go look at the Twitter feeds ‘reporters,'” he said. “It is rife with snide smarmy comments with editorialized opinion.”</p>
