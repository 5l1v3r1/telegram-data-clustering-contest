      <p>Last month, SoftBank was forced to spend more than $10 billion to bail out WeWork after the U.S. company’s IPO attempt flopped, and it said on Wednesday the fair value of its investment in the office-sharing startup decreased by $3.4 billion in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>At a post-earnings briefing, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said his judgment in dealing with WeWork had been poor in many ways, a remarkable admission for an executive well known for his ebullience.</p>
      <p>Here are some of Son’s comments, translated from Japanese:</p>
      <p>On WeWork:</p>
      <p>* Says his judgment on WeWork was poor in many ways, but the U.S. company is not a sinking boat</p>
      <p>* Says in about 18 months the majority of WeWork offices will be profitable as occupancy increases</p>
      <p>* SoftBank stopped new leases for WeWork a month ago and this may continue for three to four years, Son says</p>
      <p>* Says he expects there will be a hockey stick recovery in WeWork profits</p>
      <p>* Son says he was told off by SoftBank board members over WeWork</p>
      <p>On WeWork founder Adam Neumann:</p>
      <p>* Son says he overestimated Neumann’s good side, turned a blind eye to things like corporate governance, and that he should have known better</p>
      <p>* Says learned a harsh lesson from his experience with Neumann</p>
      <p>On Vision Fund 2:</p>
      <p>* Says Vision Fund 2 is starting investing with SoftBank’s money</p>
      <p>* Vision Fund 2 is going to be launched as scheduled, declined to discuss status of negotiations with potential investors</p>
      <p>* Vision Fund 2 to be a similar size to the first $100 billion fund</p>
      <p>On IPO pipeline:</p>
      <p>* Says has started to think SoftBank should be more cautious about timing of IPOs for companies like Uber and Slack</p>
      <p>* Says there is no change to the trend that multiple portfolio companies will go public every year</p>
      <p>* Says for companies that are getting closer to turning a profit, SoftBank will support them in going public</p>
