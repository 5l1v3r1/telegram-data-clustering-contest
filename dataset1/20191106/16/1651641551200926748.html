      <p>OnePlus has started rolling out <b>OxygenOS 10.0.5</b> to OnePlus 7T smartphones. The update brings bug fixes, improvement in system stability and Android security patch 2019.10.</p>
      <p>Further, the latest OxygenOS update brings fixes for the double-tap gesture issue, meaning that the double-tap gesture will now work more reliably once you install the update on your OnePlus 7T smartphone. You can see the official changelog below.</p>
      <h3> Changelog</h3>
      <blockquote><b>System<br/></b>   •  Fixed the double-tap gesture for screen activation<br/>   •  Updated Android security patch to 2019.10<br/>   •  Improved system stability and General bug fixes</blockquote>
      <p>This update will be rolled out in a phased manner, meaning that if you’re one of the few who are using the smartphone right now, you might not get it today. OnePlus, however, confirmed that it’ll begin a broader rollout in a few days.</p>
      <p>As you can see, the OxygenOS 10.0.5 update is not as feature-rich as its predecessor <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/latest-oxygenos-update-for-oneplus-7t-series-brings-cloud-service-to-the-gallery-app/">OxygenOS 10.0.4</a>, which introduced some useful new features such as cloud service in the Gallery app, improvement in camera quality, optimized translation accuracy.</p>
      <p>Note, the update is available only for OnePlus 7T users, so if you’re using OnePlus 7T Pro or other older model you’ll have to wait a while to get it on your smartphone.</p>
