      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-news">Kilmarnock</a> road has been partially closed as emergency services deal with an ongoing incident.</p>
      <p>The one-way system just next to Kilmarnock Bus Station has been closed off as two ambulances and a police vehicle attend to the situation with a bus in front of them.</p>
      <p>Drivers heading in from London Road could be affected as buses will need to divert on to the left lane making it a single lane junction for now.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what the incident is as of yet, we will update you on the Kilmarnock Standard <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kilmarnock.standard/">Facebook page</a> as we get more information.</p>
