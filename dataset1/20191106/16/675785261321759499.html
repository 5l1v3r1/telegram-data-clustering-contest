      <p>A man bitten by a venomous snake had his arm sliced with a razor blade while receiving treatment from a shaman.</p>
      <p>Parafulla Majhi, 28, went to seek help from local shaman, Sarbeswar Pradhan, after he was attacked by a venomous snake.</p>
      <p>He was bitten in the right arm when he was in Ranapur near Nayagad, Odisha, east India, last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Video of his visit to the shaman shows Sarbeswar chanting mantras and praying with neem leaves.</p>
      <p>He even cut the snake bite wounds with a razor blade in an effort to 'bleed the poison'.</p>

      <p>The shaman then stabs several times all around Parafulla's wrist and arm before brushing the blood off with the neem leaves.</p>
      <p>The unorthodox ritual was stopped by members of the Snake Helpline charityÂ  who rushed to rescue the man after hearing about the 'treatment'.</p>
      <p>The charity workers had a row with the shaman and forcibly took Parafulla to a hospital.</p>

      <p>The patient was administered with snake anti-venom and discharged two days later.</p>
      <p>General Secretary of Snake Helpline Subhendu Malik said: "Cutting the the bite site with a blade is an old method and very harmful. It makes makes the wound difficult to manage and increases risk of secondary infections."</p>
      <p>"The shaman should be arrested for endangering the victim," Subhendu added.</p>
