我們想讓你知道的是透過《小丑》這套電影，筆者想探討患病母親如何影響孩子的成長以至一生。

潮語有云「孩子生性病母倍感安慰」，「病母」中的「病」不一定指其肉體的殘障，也可以包括「心病」。
以下想透過《小丑》這套受歡迎的電影，探討患病母親如何影響孩子的成長以至一生。
（以下內容會大程度地劇透，請自行判斷是否繼續閱讀。）
片中意想不到的幾個轉折
在《小丑》電影中段，男主角Arthur（下稱為Joker）發現母親Penny心中和蝙幅俠的父親Thomas Wayne有一段情，所以她每天風雨不改地寫信給Thomas，堅信他會給予援助。
落泊潦倒的Joker竟然是億萬富翁及市長候選人Thomas的私生子，即死敵蝙蝠俠的哥哥。其狗血程度跟《世紀之戰》中方新俠和丁野的父子關係可以匹敵。

其後Thomas及管家Alfred皆說一切是媽媽的妄想。這種妄想就是一種叫「情愛妄想（Erotomania）」的常見妄想類型，這種妄想者堅信一位通常有社經地位的名人是自己的情人，儘管他們可能從來沒有任何接觸[1]。
情愛妄想（Erotomania），即堅信一位通常有社經地位的名人是自己情人，儘管你們可能從來沒有任何接觸。
當時認為Thomas的妄想論只是因為想保持富豪形象、推卸責任而作出來的藉口。怎料原來她媽媽Penny真是患上了妄想症！Joker的癡笑性癲癇[2] 亦可能是因童年時被虐打所得。這情節實在是非常意想不到。Joker那種晴天霹靂、一無所有之痛和無奈的感受也深刻地表露出來。
Joker媽媽如何影響他的人生
由上可見，最影響Joker人生的人就是他「媽媽」Penny。在電影起始便知道Joker的夢想是成為一位媲美偶像Murray Franklin般的棟篤笑匠。他不喜歡現在的小丑工作，可是卻因為要照顧病母，而不得做這工作以支付負重的醫藥和生活費。

如果沒有Penny這「病母」，他雖然還是要養活自己，但起碼他可以做些更輕鬆的工作。例如他可以解除自己的工作枷鎖，到各個酒吧參與棟篤笑的open mic和觀看棟篤笑表演。
另外Joker也長期缺乏愛。每天辛勞工作歸家後，母親從來不會關心他工作有否不順心、有否遇到難過的事，Penny把所有的愛和關注落到Thomas身上。
Penny的忽略是一種傷害。她的「正能量」更是一把利刃。Joker不時會重複這兩句說話：
“She told me I had a purpose to bring laughter and joy to the world”“My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face”
病母成為Joker內心枷鎖
正是如此，無論Joker遇到多不幸的事，他自動自覺地收起內心的哀傷。一位心理學家朋友曾說過：
要根治有精神或情緒困擾的「問題兒童」，最重要「治療」家長。
這雖不是什麼名家的偉大理論，卻不無道理。家長，特別是母親，往往是影響一個人最深的人。德國心理學家Bert Hellinger亦相信：
你和你母親的關係，決定你和世界的關係。[3]
Penny就彷如Joker內心的枷鎖。Joker要解放自己，幹掉Penny是必然的事。

Penny是否真的有妄想症？
討論完母親如何影響孩子人格建立的論述，不如窺探一下電影的隱藏線索。
有網民提出了有趣的看法：Joker真是Thomas Wayne的親生兒子。在Penny被殺害後，Joker找到一張母親年青時的照片，背面寫著「Love your smile – TW」 。TW看來是Thomas Wayne的署名。如果精神病院的報告是真的，為什麼要安排這個細節呢？是給觀眾的暗示還是故弄玄虛？
有人說這是用來解釋Penny如何形成Thomas戀上自己的妄想。但如前所提及，妄想形成是不需要實際接觸的，一切可以緣於想法。所以這個接觸都是沒必要的。而以Thomas的財雄勢大，要捏造醫療報告，並非難事[4]。

""The Clown"" - How does a mentally ill mother influence the establishment of her son's personality?
06 Nov 2019, 16:10 by Tree Cave - TreeholeHK


What we want you to know is that through the movie ""The Clown"", the author wants to explore how a sick mother can affect her child's growth and even her life.

There is a cloud in the Chao language. ""Children have a feeling of comfort in their sexually transmitted diseases."" The ""disease"" in ""the sick mother"" does not necessarily mean the physical disability, but may also include ""heart disease.""
Here's how to use the popular movie ""The Clown"" to explore how a sick mother can affect a child's growth and even her life.
(The following content will be spoiled to a large extent, please judge whether you want to continue reading.)
Unexpected twists in the film
In the middle of the ""Clown"" movie, actor Arthur (hereinafter referred to as Joker) found that his mother Penny had a love with Batman's father, Thomas Wayne, so she wrote a letter to Thomas every day, convinced that he would give assistance.
Joker, who has fallen to the ground, turned out to be the illegitimate son of billionaire and mayor candidate Thomas, the brother of the deadly enemy Batman. The degree of dog blood can be matched with the relationship between the Chinese New Man and Ding Ye’s father and son in The Battle of the Century.

Then Thomas and the housekeeper Alfred said that everything is a mother's delusion. This delusion is a common type of delusion called ""Erotomania"", a creator who believes that a celebrity who usually has a socioeconomic status is his own lover, although they may never have any contact [1].
Erotomania, that is, a celebrity who usually has a socioeconomic status is his own lover, although you may never have any contact.
At that time, Thomas's delusion was only mentioned as an excuse to maintain the image of the rich and shirk responsibility. How could it be that her mother Penny was suffering from paranoia! Joker's ridiculous epilepsy [2] may also be due to childhood abuse. This episode is really unexpected. Joker's kind of blue sky, all the pain and helpless feelings are also deeply revealed.
How does Joker's mother influence his life?
It can be seen from the above that the person who most affects Joker's life is his ""mother"" Penny. At the beginning of the movie, Joker's dream was to become a singer-like artist like Murray Franklin. He doesn't like the current clown work, but because he has to take care of the sick mother, he can't do this work to pay for the weight of medicine and living expenses.

If there is no such thing as Penny, he still has to support himself, but at least he can do some easier work. For example, he can lift his work shackles, go to the bars to participate in the open mic and watch the laughter performance.
In addition, Joker has long lacked love. After working hard to get home every day, my mother never cares whether his work is not good or not, and Penny brings all his love and attention to Thomas.
Penny's neglect is a kind of injury. Her ""positive energy"" is a sharp knife. Joker repeats these two sentences from time to time:
""She told me I had a purpose to bring laughter and joy to the world"" ""My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face""
The sick mother becomes Joker's inner shackles
This is the case, no matter how unfortunate Joker encounters, he automatically and consciously put away his inner grief. A psychologist friend once said:
It is most important to ""treat"" parents if they are to cure ""problem children"" who have mental or emotional problems.
This is not a great theory of a famous family, but it is not without reason. Parents, especially mothers, are often the ones who influence one person the most. German psychologist Bert Hellinger also believes that:
Your relationship with your mother determines your relationship with the world. [3]
Penny is like a shackle in Joker's heart. Joker wants to liberate himself. It is inevitable to kill Penny.

Does Penny really have paranoia?
After discussing how the mother influences the establishment of the child's personality, it is better to spy on the hidden clues of the movie.
Some netizens have come up with interesting ideas: Joker is really the son of Thomas Wayne. After Penny was killed, Joker found a photo of his mother when he was young, with ""Love your smile – TW"" on the back. TW appears to be the signature of Thomas Wayne. If the report of the mental hospital is true, why should we arrange this detail? Is it a hint to the audience or is it a mystery?
Some people say that this is used to explain how Penny formed Thomas's dream of falling in love with himself. But as mentioned before, delusion formation does not require physical contact, and everything can be due to ideas. So this contact is not necessary. It is not difficult to make medical reports with Thomas’s financial strength [4].
