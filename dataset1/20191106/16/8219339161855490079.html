      <h3>AirPods Pro deal brings prices back to $235</h3>
      <p><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/06/airpods-pro-sams-club/">A new Apple AirPods Pro deal has surfaced this morning, returning prices to <b>$235</b></a> at Costco. That’s down from the <a href="https://amzn.to/34v05kS">usual $249 going rate at Amazon</a> and a match of the best offer we’ve seen. With various other retailers experiencing <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/05/how-to-check-airpods-pro-stock-apple-amazon-best-buy/">delayed</a> shipping, this is a great time to pick up Apple’s new flagship earbuds at a discount. AirPods Pro delivers a refreshed take of the popular original version, now featuring active noise cancellation, tapered silicone tips, and a water-resistant design. Apple’s H1 chip ensures you have fast connectivity and up to 24 hours of battery life. <a href="https://amzn.to/2CgYx1N"><b>Save roughly $90</b> and go with Apple’s second-generation AirPods</a>.</p>

      <h3>Take $170 off Pioneer’s 6.2-inch CarPlay Receiver</h3>
      <p>Best Buy’s official eBay storefront offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/06/pioneer-6-2-inch-carplay-receiver/">Pioneer 6.2-inch CarPlay Receiver (AVIC-5201NEX) for <b>$480</b></a>. Also available directly from Best Buy. Usually selling for $650, like you’ll find at <a href="https://amzn.to/2NnjK0j">Amazon</a> right now, today’s offer is the best we’ve tracked in months, comes within $30 of the previous price drop, and is the lowest currently available. Featuring an over six-inch touchscreen display, Pioneer’s CarPlay receiver is a must-have upgrade to your ride. It notably makes keeping an eye on directions, music playback, and more a breeze while commuting.
