      <p><b>PRECIOUS SUPPORT:</b> Breast Cancer Awareness Month might be over, but the commitment of brands in supporting the cause is not.</p>
      <p>Italian historic <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/jewelry-2/">jewelry</a>-maker Sabbadini is the latest of a long list of companies offering giveback programs as it has released a <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/capsule-collection/">capsule collection</a> to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>
      <p>The line includes signature pieces from the Sabbadini collections, revisited with a pink touch in a nod to the color of the international battle against breast cancer. Items range from a titanium bracelet with pink sapphires to bee-shaped pendants, earrings and brooches in white gold embellished with diamonds and pink enamel.</p>
      <p>Starting from this month, the <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/replay-paris-saint-germain-ink-tie-up-1203358897/">capsule collection</a> will be available for a year at the Sabbadini stores in Milan and Saint Moritz, Switzerland. It will also travel across the world via the brand’s trunk shows hosted in key global locations, including New York. With prices spanning from 2,000 to 18,000 euros, the <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/scad-new-york-city-jewelry-week-1203353848/">jewelry</a>-maker will donate 30 percent of the proceeds of each piece sold to the nonprofit organization, which was founded in 1993 by the late Evelyn H. Lauder.</p>

And we do this through our signature creativity and craftsmanship, which are the core values of our company.”</p>
