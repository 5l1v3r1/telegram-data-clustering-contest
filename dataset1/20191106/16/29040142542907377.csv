It’s never fun to have to dish out an exorbitant amount of cash in order to fix an appliance or electrical issue at home, but surprisingly few people take the time to learn the skills that can let them tackle these repairs on their own.
The Ultimate Electrical Engineering Master Class Bundle will teach you how to perform a wide variety of electrical repairs yourself, and it’s available for over 95% off at just $25.
With 5 courses and over 40 hours of training, this bundle will outfit you with a solid understanding of electrical engineering principles that will save you time and money.
After an introduction to the basics of circuitry, you’ll learn how to work with and repair grounding systems, how to stay safe while working in a variety of wiring environments, how to install and maintain solar power sources in your home, and much more.
If you’re looking to take your skills to a more professional level, there’s also a course that breaks down more complex electrical engineering methods that allow you to build induction machines and transformers.
Start saving money by doing your own electrical repairs with the Ultimate Electrical Engineering Master Class Bundle for just $25—over 95% off its usual price for a limited time.

Prices are subject to change.
