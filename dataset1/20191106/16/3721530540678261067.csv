The newest DLC fighter has arrived in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Terry Bogard, of SNK fame, has been added to the game in patch 6.0.
The game’s director Masahiro Sakurai showed some of Terry’s abilities and moves, and gave fans a look at the new King of Fighters stage, during Nintendo’s 45 minute Smash Bros. livestream on Wednesday morning.



Terry has a few unique moves, but his biggest strength becomes available once his damage goes above 100 percent. At that point, Terry can use his Super Special Moves. These abilities are high-risk, high-reward attacks that might allow you to turn the momentum of a match around, even if things look hopeless.
Patch 6.0 also includes the new King of Fighters stage as well as several new Mii costumes. On the online side of things, Nintendo has added the ability for hosts to change the rules without shutting down their arena. There’s also now an option to add Random Battlefield and Omega Form maps in the stage settings.
While the patch is free to all Super Smash Bros. Ultimate players, Terry and the new King of Fighters stage must be purchased for $4.99 in Challenger Pack 4, or as part of the Fighters pass for $24.99.
