      <p>(Nov 6): U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose sharply last week as refineries cut output and exports dropped, while refined products extended a multi-week drawdown, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Crude inventories rose by 7.9 million barrels in the week to Nov 1, compared with analysts' expectations in a <i>Reuters</i> poll for an increase of 1.5 million barrels.</p>
      <p>The drop-off in refining utilization and a slump in exports, which some analysts believe is tied to reduced tanker availability due to U.S. sanctions on Chinese shipping firm COSCO, surprised many.</p>
      <p>“I guess we stopped using oil last week. It’s amazing. This is definitely a shocking number — even if you’re bearish you’re shocked," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Oil prices were mixed, with global benchmark Brent crude futures down 14 cents to US$62.82 but U.S. crude rising 6 cents to US$57.29 per barrel as of 10:56 a.m. ET (1556 GMT).</p>
      <p>Refinery crude runs fell by 237,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 1.7 percentage points to 86% of total capacity.</p>
      <p>Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 622,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 949,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Overall distillate inventories, which have declined for seven weeks in a row, fell to 119.1 million barrels, their lowest since June 2018.</p>
      <p>Gasoline stocks also extended their decline, falling for the sixth straight week, with a 2.8 million-barrel draw, compared with analysts' expectations for a 1.8 million-barrel drop.</p>
      <p>Stockpiles of gasoline and distillate products were down in the U.S. Midwest to their lowest levels in a year.</p>
      <p>Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 336,000 bpd, as exports alone slumped nearly 1 million bpd to 2.4 million bpd.</p>
      <p>Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S crude futures rose by 1.7 million barrels, the EIA said.</p>
      <p>Cushing inventories have grown for five weeks in a row but that may switch in the next week, after the closure of the 590,000-bpd Keystone Pipeline following a spill of more than 9,000 barrels in North Dakota last week, even tough analysts had expected to see an effect as early as this week.</p>
      <p>"Cushing storage is up 15 million barrels above last year at this time," said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho. "Cushing, which you would have thought would have been a negative number after the Keystone pipeline went down, is up 1.7 million."</p>
