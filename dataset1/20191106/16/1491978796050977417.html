      </p>
      <p>A second man has admitted trying to rob the Premier League stars Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Özil of their watches in a moped ambush.</p>
      <p>Jordan Northover, 26, pleaded guilty to trying to steal the expensive items from the Arsenal footballers in Platts Lane, Hampstead, north-west London on 25 July, Harrow crown court heard.</p>
      <p>Ashley Smith, 30, has already admitted his role in the attempted raid against close friends Özil, 31, and Kolasinac, 26.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage circulated widely on social media showed the burly Bosnian defender Kolasinac, nicknamed the Tank, chasing off the two moped attackers, who were wearing helmets and dark clothing.</p>
      <p>The club’s £350,000-a-week German midfielder Özil can be seen in his 4x4 Mercedes G-Class before reportedly taking refuge in a Turkish restaurant.</p>
      <p>World Cup winner Özil and full-back Kolasinac were left out of the Arsenal side after the incident.</p>

      <p>Following the ordeal, Özil told the Athletic sports site he was scared for his wife, Amine, as the attackers pursued his car.</p>
      <p>He said: “They told him directly: ‘Give us your watch.’ Sead’s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers.</p>
      <p>“We were newly wed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead.</p>
      <p>“I saw one chance to drive. If they got to my wife, something terrible might have happened to her.</p>
      <p>“I started driving but they followed. I was driving very fast but they kept coming close on the moped.</p>
      <p>“I tried to move the car, block them, escape, but each time they would be there. My wife was extremely scared.”</p>
      <p>Smith, of Archway, north London would be sentenced at Harrow crown court on Friday, Judge Rosa Dean said.</p>
      <p>Northover will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
