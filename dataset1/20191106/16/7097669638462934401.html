      <h1>Trump news: First public impeachment hearings to begin in days, as president suffers election humiliation and huge 2020 poll deficits</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T16:58:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Joe Sommerlad, Clark Mindock</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/david-hale">David Hale</a>, a senior State Department official, is testifying to the House <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> the morning after <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> suffered a series of disastrous electoral setbacks, with the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democrats</a> declaring victory in key races in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kentucky">Kentucky</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump also finds himself trailing behind Democratic 2020 candidates <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> by double-digit margins on Wednesday, according to the latest poll from ABC News/<i>Washington Post</i>.</p>
      <p>Perhaps worst of all, the presidentâ€™s ambassador to the EU, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, a key figure in the impeachment probe, has revised his own testimony, admitting a quid pro quo was behind the decision to withhold military aid from <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and that the administration only planned to release the money in exchange for new president <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> announcing an anti-corruption probe into Mr Biden.</p>
      <p>The day proceeded with Democrats announcing the first set of public impeachment hearings for next week.</p>
      <p>Then, testimony from William Taylor was released in full, showing a worrisome situation for the president.</p>
