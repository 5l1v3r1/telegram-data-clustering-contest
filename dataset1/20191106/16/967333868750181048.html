        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Just weeks after Tik Tok user Hareem Shah hogged headlines by occupying the Pakistani prime minister’s chair in the Foreign Ministry, a man has allegedly conned numerous politicians by impersonating a BBC reporter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A man allegedly pretending to be a journalist from the British public broadcaster BBC has come under fire after being busted by a journalist on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The man, who is yet to be identified, is said to have interviewed several senior Pakistani ministers while wearing a fake identity card and carrying a mic with a BBC World News logo on it.</p>
      <blockquote>An inquiry has been launched after the alleged impostor entered the restricted senate area, said Pakistani Senator Rehman Malik.</blockquote>
      <p>The man sporting long hair pretended to be a BBC Italy reporter, while interviewing former Interior Minister Rehman Malik.</p>
      <p>After the pictures of him appeared on the internet, a BBC Urdu journalist Tahir Imran Mian called his bluff by pointing out: “...this guy is an imposter who pretends to be a BBC journalist. He is not a BBC employ [sic]”.</p>

      <p>Minister Malik also tweeted, saying he suspected the man of being a fraud when he got nervous after the politician posed questions to him. Malik subsequently registered a complaint against the reporter at the BBC office in Islamabad.</p>
      <p>“I suspected him and reported to BBC and ordered the inquiry. He interviewed many senators including Amir JI. He will be arrested as impostor,” Malik said.</p>

      <p>The incident evoked reactions by several concerned citizens as recently a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910231077128852-pakistan-tik-tok-queen-occupies-pms-chair-draws-twitteratis-fury/">Tik Tok user breached the security of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry</a> and occupied the chair reserved for the country’s prime minister.</p>
