A Kilmarnock road has been partially closed as emergency services deal with an ongoing incident.
The one-way system just next to Kilmarnock Bus Station has been closed off as two ambulances and a police vehicle attend to the situation with a bus in front of them.
Drivers heading in from London Road could be affected as buses will need to divert on to the left lane making it a single lane junction for now.
It is unclear what the incident is as of yet, we will update you on the Kilmarnock Standard Facebook page as we get more information.
