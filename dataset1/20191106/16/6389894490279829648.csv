Gail’s opened its first branch in Hampstead in 2005 and it now has 50 bakeries in and around London.
Johnson has had a tough year following the discovery of a multi-million pound black hole in the accounts of cake-chain Patisserie Valerie where he was executive chairman.
The business crashed into administration in February despite Johnson’s provision of £10m in emergency funding.
