Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet Grind in This Little Women Clip. Just Kidding!
06 Nov 2019, 16:30 by Zoe Haylock



Even Nicholas Sparks couldn’t write chemistry this good. Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet were made to play love interests, even if their love is always unrequited (word to alleged truth-teller Kyle Schieble). In a clip from their new movie, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, Saoirse Ronan is the playful Jo, relegated to a corner after setting her dress on fire. Chalamet plays Laurie, who looks at her, burnt dress and all, like she’s the first peach of the season: precious and impossible. And there’s only one thing to do when two people are sitting on a couch, away from the chaos of a party … they go outside and dance! The dancing quickly devolves into crazed hopping, but it’s their crazed hopping. Too bad it can’t last forever — Jo’s got a book to write.
