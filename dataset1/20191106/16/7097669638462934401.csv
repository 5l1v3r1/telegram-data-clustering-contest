Trump news: First public impeachment hearings to begin in days, as president suffers election humiliation and huge 2020 poll deficits
06 Nov 2019, 16:58 by Joe Sommerlad, Clark Mindock
David Hale, a senior State Department official, is testifying to the House impeachment inquiry the morning after Donald Trump suffered a series of disastrous electoral setbacks, with the Democrats declaring victory in key races in Virginia and Kentucky.
Mr Trump also finds himself trailing behind Democratic 2020 candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg by double-digit margins on Wednesday, according to the latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post.
Perhaps worst of all, the president’s ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, a key figure in the impeachment probe, has revised his own testimony, admitting a quid pro quo was behind the decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine and that the administration only planned to release the money in exchange for new president Volodymyr Zelensky announcing an anti-corruption probe into Mr Biden.
The day proceeded with Democrats announcing the first set of public impeachment hearings for next week.
Then, testimony from William Taylor was released in full, showing a worrisome situation for the president.
