      <h1>Iran to start injecting uranium gas into more than 1,000 centrifuges at midnight</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran">Iran</a> is gearing up Wednesday to start injecting uranium gas into more than 1,000 centrifuges at a site described by nuclear watchdogs as a “fortified, underground bunker.”</p>
      <p>The 1,044 devices at the Fordo facility will be pumped with gas beginning at midnight, and will be used to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/nuclear">enrich uranium</a> up to 4.5%, Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told state television today.</p>
      <p>The development will mark Tehran’s latest step away from the nuclear accord with world powers since President Trump withdrew from the deal over a year ago.</p>
      <p>As of now, Iran is enriching uranium up to 4.5%, in violation of the accord's limit of 3.67%, the Associated Press reports.</p>

      <p>Enriched uranium at the 3.67% level is enough for peaceful pursuits but is far below weapons-grade levels of 90%. At the 4.5% level, it is enough to help power Iran's Bushehr reactor, the country's only nuclear power plant.</p>
      <p>Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed not to operate the Fordo centrifuges. Iranian officials have said these steps are “reversible” if European nations that also signed the deal find a way to allow Iran to sell its oil on foreign markets and compensate Tehran for U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>The looming changes at Fordo were first announced by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the United Nations' nuclear watchdog monitoring Iran's compliance with the deal -- later told state-run media that the watchdog received word of Tehran's decision in a letter. That message also asked the IAEA for its inspectors to be on hand Wednesday for the gas injections.</p>
      <p>U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus decried the move, saying Iran originally built Fordo as a "fortified, underground bunker in which to conduct secret uranium enrichment work."</p>

      <p>"Iran has no credible reason to expand its uranium enrichment program, at the Fordo facility or elsewhere, other than a clear attempt at nuclear extortion that will only deepen its political and economic isolation," Ortagus said.</p>
      <p>European Union spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic also described the bloc as being "concerned" by Iran's decision.</p>
