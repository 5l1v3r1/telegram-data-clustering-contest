The film will be a romantic drama but it won't be just an ordinary romance-drama but will have a twist in it.</p>
      <p>A source was quoted saying, "She has wowed everyone with her performance in these edgy films and looks like she is gearing up for one more. So, this romantic film will have its own unique storytelling and present Anushka again in a totally different light."</p>

Talking about the same, she said that staying away from home gives a sense of independence and immense opportunity for the young to know themselves better.
