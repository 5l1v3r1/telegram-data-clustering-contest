        <b>Former Commons Speaker John Bercow has called Brexit "the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giving his opinion to the Foreign Press Association in London, he told journalists he no longer had to "remain impartial" after stepping down from the chair after 10 years.</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow was accused by some Brexit-backing MPs of siding with Remainers during his time as Speaker.</p>
      <p>But he told the event he believed he was "always fair" to MPs on all sides.</p>

      <p>Mr Bercow announced his intention to stand down in September, with his exit due to coincide with 31 October Brexit deadline - now delayed until 31 January.</p>
      <p>His deputy, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, was elected to take over his post on Monday.</p>
      <p>With his new-found freedom to express his opinion, journalists questioned him about his time as Speaker.</p>
      <p>And asked whether Brexit would be good for the UK's global standing, Mr Bercow told the event: "The honest answer is no."</p>
      <p>He added: "I think that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the post-war period, and that is my honest view."</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow also said, "with total certainty", Parliament would be debating Brexit for at least the next five years - if not the next 15 - and that was "blindingly obvious".</p>
      <h3>'Fair way'</h3>
      <p>During his decade in the role, Mr Bercow gave unprecedented powers to backbenchers to hold ministers to account and made controversial and far-reaching procedural decisions at key stages of the Brexit process.</p>
      <p>Answering his critics, Mr Bercow told the event he had "always treated the Brexiteers in a fair way" and "always treated the Remainers in a fair way".</p>
      <p>He added: "I will assert to anybody that will listen until my dying day that I have been impartial in the chair, pro-Parliament and impartial in the chair."</p>
      <p>But Brexit Party MEP Rupert Lowe said it was "disgraceful" someone with Mr Bercow's views was "allowed to referee our Parliament for so long", adding: "The whole establishment is geared against Brexit."</p>
