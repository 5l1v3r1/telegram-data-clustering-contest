Provost Jim Todd helped kick off the annual Scottish Poppy Appeal in Ayrshire at a reception in Kilmarnock’s Dean Castle Visitor Centre.
The event – with support from East Ayrshire Council – was the first time Poppyscotland has held a reception to mark the start of the appeal.
While Poppyscotland’s vital, life-changing work in support of the armed forces community in Scotland is a year-round endeavour, the annual Poppy Appeal is its biggest annual fundraiser.
Last year it raised more than £3million, the highest total ever in the 97-year history of the appeal.
The Provost spoke about the importance of the Poppy Appeal and the Remembrance period, as well as the incredible work that has been carried out through the Poppyscotland Welfare Centre in Kilmarnock since it opened two years ago.
 
Mark Bibbey, chief executive at Poppyscotland, said: “The reception to launch this year’s Scottish Poppy Appeal in Ayrshire was a special occasion as we had so many colleagues, friends and beneficiaries in attendance.

“It was the first time we have held such an event in Kilmarnock for the Poppy Appeal and I would like to express our warm thanks to Provost Todd and East Ayrshire Council for their hospitality and ongoing support.”
Kilmarnock’s Remembrance Sunday service begins at 10.15am at Kilmarnock Academy playground.
Councilors and Clergy will leave from the Dick Institute at 10.50am.
Following the service at the war memorial, the minister will announce local church services.
Events are taking place across East Ayrshire.
