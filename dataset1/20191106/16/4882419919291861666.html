      <h2>The Italian club's director of football, Giuseppe Marotta, cools talk of a move for the Barça midfielder in January</h2>

      <p>Inter Milan's director of football, Giuseppe Marotta, has poured cold water on the talk of Arturo Vidal's return to Serie A. The Chilean international has been linked with a move to Inter over the past few weeks as a personal request from manager Antonio Conte.</p>
      <p>Marotta travelled to Germany to watch his team face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. Naturally he was asked about the possible signing of Vidal in January. "Arturo Vidal? Like Chilean fans, we're anxiously waiting for the return of Alexis Sanchez," responded Marotta. "He should return to the group in January and he'll feel like a new signing. One Chilean is enough."</p>
      <p>Vidal has been linked with moves away from Barça as they look to reduce their wage bill. He's well-loved in Italy and has spoken about his desire to work under Conte again. As things stand, that won't be happening until the summer.</p>
