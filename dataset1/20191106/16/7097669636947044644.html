      <h1>EU Taps Romanian Commissioner as U.K. Remains the Last Holdout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T16:34:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Stearns</a></address>
      <p>(Bloomberg) -- European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen selected a new Romanian member of her team, leaving only the U.K. to announce its nominee.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen assigned Adina-Ioana Valean to be European Union transport commissioner when the new leadership of the commission, the 28-nation EU’s executive arm, takes office as soon as Dec. 1. Valean is currently a Romanian member of the European Parliament, where she chairs its industry committee.</p>
      <p>The entry into office of von der Leyen has been delayed from the scheduled Nov. 1 date after original commissioner nominees from France, Hungary and Romania were rejected in the EU Parliament, which must approve her whole team. Under EU rules, the Brussels-based commission must have a commissioner from each EU country.</p>
      <p>Since its planned departure from the bloc was delayed, the U.K. is required to nominate a commissioner as well. The current British member of the commission is Julian King, whose portfolio is security matters.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen has written to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking him to propose a commissioner for her team, an EU spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
