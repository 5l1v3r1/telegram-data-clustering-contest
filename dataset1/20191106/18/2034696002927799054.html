      <p>The voiceover plays over a series of clips from the anthology series, which Parton appears in herself. “Jolene, will you get your pretty lil butt up here and help me sing,” she says in one scene as she speaks down the mic to a crowded bar.</p>

      <p>Speaking in a recent interview, Parton explained: “Years back when I used to think of Jolene, you know, before Julianne came on, I used to think… ‘I’d love Miley.’ She would have been great at that as well. But Miley was doing other things.”</p>
