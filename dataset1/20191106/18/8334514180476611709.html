      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - French volunteer search teams have found fragments from an engine that exploded in mid-air over eastern France in July, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The discovery came in an unprecedented search operation involving 150 members of the public after French air accident investigation agency BEA asked volunteers to help comb a forest for a titanium engine part following two engine explosions on Airbus A220 jets operated by the airline Swiss since July.</p>
      <p>A third engine suffered a similar blowout last month, forcing it to divert to Paris where it scattered some parts during landing, according to French officials.</p>
      <p>“Three fragments from the engine have been found by the ... volunteer team ... Thanks to all participants of this first day,” BEA said on its Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>The engine incidents have prompted worldwide engine checks on Airbus A220 and some Embraer aircraft, but no flaws have been found.</p>
      <p>They have heightened scrutiny of a new generation of fuel-saving engines built by U.S. manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, after a series of reliability problems. But a version of the engines used on Airbus’s larger and more widely used A320 series is not affected by the checks.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported last month that a U.S-led investigation was focusing on a recent update in engine software that may have inadvertently allowed parts to resonate or vibrate destructively during certain settings.</p>
      <p>Finding the engine fragment could help confirm the theory, though investigators have not ruled out titanium manufacturing problems.</p>
      <p>A220 pilots have been told to avoid placing unusually high demands on the engine above 29,000 feet, while a new version of the software is finalised for the first quarter of next year. </p>
