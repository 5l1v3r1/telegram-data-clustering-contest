      <h1>Celtic injury update as Boli Bolingoli and Tom Rogic miss out on Lazio clash</h1>
      <h2>Celtic will also be without Leigh Griffiths and Mikey Johnston have also failed to travel from</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:55:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic will be without Boli Bolingoli and Tom Rogic for their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> tie with Lazio.</p>
      <p>The pair didn't travel to Italy for the clash with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> and Mikey Johnston also left in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Griffiths and Johnston have been missing since August and September respectively while Bolingoli was replaced at half time during the 5-2 win over Hibs on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Griffiths trained at Celtic Park this morning but isn't ready to turn out for the Hoops just yet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> admits his side are looking forward to the clash in Rome but knows how difficult the game is going to be.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> beat Lazio two weeks ago with goals from Ryan Christie and Christopher Jullien coupled with Fraser Forster's stunning late save.</p>
      <p>Christie is now likely to be back in the team for this game and Lennon insists they aren't taking anything for granted despite being currently top of the group.</p>
      <p>He said: "In the context of the group it's an important game.</p>
      <p>"So much quality in both the sides. It's my first time in Rome taking the team so it is very special. It's a game we're very excited and very motivated for.</p>

      <p>"Lazio's form is very good, another great win in the San Siro on Sunday, so we're under no illusions about how big the job is as we try and go for a result.</p>
      <p>"The players are in great form themselves, they've played very well domestically. We currently top the group, that can change very quickly but we're here to try and get a positive result.</p>
      <p>"It sort of takes the shine of it a little bit. When the draw was made this is the game everyone associated with the club was looking forward to.</p>
      <p>"Our players have played in intimidating atmospheres so I don't think it'll effect the mindset too much. We're here to play the game and not the occasion."</p>
