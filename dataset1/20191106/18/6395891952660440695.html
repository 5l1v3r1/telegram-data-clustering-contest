      <p><b>MANSFIELD, Mass.</b> - A Mansfield auto mechanic has died more than a month after suffering severe burns in a fire that destroyed a popular gas station where he worked. </p>
      <p>Ron Stanovitch, a mechanic at the station, was involved in a welding accident when the fire started, authorities said. </p>
      <p>Loyal customers of Canaan Fuels in Mansfield were in disbelief in the days after fire burned out of control at the gas station.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't believe it, Mike's always been busy down there,' customer Tommy Glavin told Boston 25 News at the time. "[I] can't believe what happened."</p>
      <p>Stanovitch's niece posted to a community Facebook page after the incident:</p>
      <p>"My family thanks Canaan Fuel employees for your heroic acts, the quick response from our public safety and the continued thoughts, prayers and contributions from the community," the post read.</p>
      <p>She went on to say that Stanovitch had surgery and would be sedated for several months.</p>
      <p>Officials at Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed to Boston 25 News Wednesday that Stanovitch had passed away. </p>
