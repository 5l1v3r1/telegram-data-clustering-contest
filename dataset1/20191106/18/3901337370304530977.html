      <p>Pitso Mosimane's were involved in Telkom Knockout action over the weekend, where they defeated Chippa United on penalties after it ended 2-2 in extra-time.</p>
      <p>Back to league matters though, Sundowns will be pushing for a return to winning ways after suffering a 2-0 defeat to league leaders Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus Versfeld Stadium.</p>
      <p>Sundowns currently occupy second spot in the standings, five points adrift of Chiefs who lock horns with the Chilli Boys in Port Elizabeth this evening.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the scale, you will find a Baroka outfit struggling for form as they enter the clash on the back of six successive defeats in all competitions, the last of which was a 1-0 loss to AmaZulu.</p>
      <p>Wedson Nyirenda's sit in 14th position as things stand, but a victory this evening could see them rise as high as 11th, provided other results go their way.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baroka:</b> 1. Chipezeze, 33. Farmer, 14. Mosele, 2. Kgoetyane, 18. Shozi, 23. Ngubane, 17. Kambala, 35. Nxumalo, 9. Mbulu, 20. Phiri Jnr, Patjie.</p>
      <p><b>Subs:</b> 30. Dlamini, 5. Makume, 26. Ntswane, 24. Madondo, 21. Mongae, 8. Mdantsane, 28 Nsimba.</p>
      <p><b>Sundowns:</b> 14. Onyango, 4. Langerman, 16. Ngcongca, 2. Madisha, 13. Mabunda, 8. Kekana, 5. Lebusa, 27. Morena, 7. Meza, 11. Vilakazi, 33. Maboe.</p>
