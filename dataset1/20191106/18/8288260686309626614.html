      <p>Manchester United fans have slammed reports linking them with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> transfer ‘target’ Dwight McNeil.</p>
      <p>The Burnley winger has attracted plenty of Premier League admirers ahead of the January window having caught the eye for Sean Dyche’s side in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Having made his senior debut last year, the 19-year-old has become a regular starter for the Clarets.</p>

      <p>“I feel a little bit frustrated about the market inflation but we are still working very hard," he said. "Our scouting team are working really hard around Europe and the world to find good talent to help us.</p>
      <p>“We are strong and we know where we are maybe a little bit weak, and I keep talking to Nuno about it. I think we will have a good window in January.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-mcneil-17205689">Man Utd are now said to be interested</a> as they identify potential new signings to boost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s struggling squad.</p>
      <p>But fans aren’t particularly impressed that McNeil’s name has cropped up after he was allowed to leave Old Trafford as a youth player five years ago.</p>
      <p>Here's what they have been saying:</p>
      <p><b>@SidaniAbdul:</b> That’s embarrassing if true, it’s why Ed and the Glazers and Ole need to go.</p>
      <p><b>@Surgeryscar:</b> There’s the cheaper Jordan Sancho.</p>
      <p><b>@Mk123syd:</b> Errr who?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@Marvelous_769:</b> We gave him away.</p>
      <p><b>@Worksop69:</b> Don't keep up with Burnley's team &amp; don't remember McNeil's name mentioned in conjunction with #MUFC before! No idea who he is.</p>
      <p><b>@Adoc26:</b> No we’re not.</p>
      <p><b>@M4TT_D4VIES:</b> This sounds more like Man Utd. Forget Sancho, lets pay money for a player we let go for free years ago.</p>
