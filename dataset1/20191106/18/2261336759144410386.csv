UFC light heavyweight prospect Johnny Walker had a bone to pick with Dan Hardy. All of it was rooted to Hardy’s claims of Walker taunting opponent Corey Anderson right before their fight at UFC 244 on Saturday.

Walker called out Hardy for spreading false information, which Hardy issued a brief response to. Recently, “The Outlaw” posted another lengthy apology via Twitter, this time explaining himself further.



To Johnny Walker, and anyone else that was upset with the comments I made regarding the taunting backstage… After seeing the tension between the two fighters before they walked out, the reaction from Corey after the fight, as well as a conversation with members of the corner team, it was my understanding that mind games had been played. If I am incorrect, then I apologize. I didn’t say it as a negative characteristic of Johnny’s, but a part of the game, and the story around the fight. Those of you that remember me as a fighter will know that I loved a bit of trash-talking. In the unique atmosphere backstage, there was ample opportunity for fighters to interact before walking out. I was under the impression that something had taken place. It wasn’t my intention to pass on incorrect information. I’m sure Johnny isn’t the kind of fighter to taunt his opponents, and (I) apologize for giving you that impression.
Anderson also defended Walker, stating it was a fan who was screaming from the other side of the curtain.
Anderson ended up victorious via first-round knockout, a win that he feels catapults him in front of the line of contenders to face current champion Jon Jones.
