Iran Briefly Held IAEA Inspector, Seized Travel Documents

07 Nov 2019, 18:15

Iran briefly held an inspector working for the UN nuclear watchdog in the country and seized her travel documents, diplomats familiar with the agency’s work said on Wednesday, with some describing it as harassment.The incident appears to be the first of its kind since Tehran’s landmark deal with major powers was struck in 2015, imposing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.Hours after Reuters reported the incident, Iran confirmed that it had prevented an inspector from accessing its Natanz site - the heart of its uranium enrichment program - last week, because of a concern that she might be carrying “suspicious material”, according to the Fars news agency.The episode comes at a time of heightened friction between Iran and the West, with Tehran breaching the deal’s restrictions step-by-step in response to Washington’s withdrawal from the deal and renewed sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency is also in transition, with a new chief taking over next month.The incident is due to be reported on at a meeting of the IAEA’s 35-nation Board of Governors on Thursday convened at short notice to discuss “two safeguards matters” not specified in the agenda, which was circulated on Monday.“The agency wants to show how seriously they are taking this. It is a potentially damaging precedent,” one Western official said.Three diplomats familiar with the agency’s work said the female inspector had her travel documents taken, and two said she was briefly held.’Real concern’An IAEA spokesman and Iran’s ambassador to the agency declined to comment.“There is a real concern that it will harm how (the IAEA) carry out their inspections in the future,” a European diplomat said.The deal, which the IAEA is policing, allows for 130-150 inspectors from the agency designated for Iran.
