      <p>BAGHDAD: As anti-government protests sweep his country, Iraq's embattled premier has found his decision-making powers clipped by rivals and his entourage subject to increasing pressure from Iran, Iraqi officials told AFP.</p>
      <p>Adel Abdel Mahdi, 77, came to power last year as the product of a tenuous alliance between populist cleric Moqtada Sadr and pro-Iran paramilitary chief Hadi al-Ameri, with the required blessing of Iraq's Shiite religious leadership.</p>

      <p>He was seen as an almost professorial figure who could tackle unemployment and government graft as Iraq's first prime minister since the defeat of the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>Most observers expected summer protests would put an early end to his mandate, and even he said he had his resignation letter "in his pocket."</p>
      <p>So when popular demonstrations erupted in early October over corruption and lack of jobs, the premier readied a resignation speech to deliver live on television, three government sources told AFP, requesting to remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>He never gave it.</p>
      <p>"He was fully intending to resign during the first week of protests - but stayed under pressure from the different factions," one of the officials said.</p>
      <p>Instead, Abdel Mahdi appeared in a stern pre-recorded address that aired around 2:00 am on October 3, proposing a package of reforms that protesters angrily dismissed as insufficient.</p>
      <p>He has since resisted intensifying calls for him to step down and for the political system to be overhauled, adopting a noticeably tougher stance towards the demonstrators.</p>
      <p>"The premier is shackled by the political parties that brought him to power," a second official said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'IN A BUBBLE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first week of rallies ended with at least 157 people dead, most of them protesters shot dead in Baghdad, according to a government probe.</p>
      <p>After a two-week lull for the Shiite Arbaeen pilgrimage, protests resumed on OctÂ 24.</p>
      <p>Sit-ins shut down public universities, provincial government offices and main streets, with protesters shrugging off the proposed reforms.</p>

      <p>But Abdel Mahdi said they were being used as "human shields" by "infiltrators."</p>
      <p>"He's in a bubble, and being told that the protests are a conspiracy against his government and that he should stay in power. He's started to believe it," one official said.</p>
      <p>Two government sources said the premier was no longer communicating with President Barham Saleh, seen as his top ally in the absence of his own popular base.</p>
      <p>"Saleh was the first one to suggest finding an alternative to Abdel Mahdi, and their ties got worse after that," one of them said.</p>
      <p>The president has hosted meetings with leading politicians to set out a roadmap to an snap general election, which would pave the way for a new prime minister.</p>
      <p>But Abdel Mahdi on Tuesday dismissed the idea of an early election.</p>
      <p>"He thinks that if he goes down, everyone should go down with him," an Iraqi official said.</p>
      <p>Others said he was also under growing pressure from Iran and its Iraqi allies, who pushed him to sideline several military commanders seen as close to the US.</p>
      <p>That pressure intensified with the arrival of Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' foreign operations arm, shortly after the protests began.</p>

      <p>Suleimani has held meetings in Baghdad and Najaf to convince top party officials to close ranks around the current government.</p>
      <p>"He's calling the shots," one official told AFP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'VICTIM OF INFIGHTING'</b>
      </p>
      <p>A second official said Abdel Mahdi "is not in a position to push back against Iranian influence".</p>
      <p>"He knows if he does not follow the Iranian line, he will be forced out and then blamed for what is going on," he said.</p>
      <p>Abdel Mahdi has made several televised addresses and publishes online statements on a near-daily basis, even as his government imposes internet restrictions in most of Iraq.</p>
      <p>After first offering to resign if political factions agreed on a replacement, he has since hardened his stance.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, he said a caretaker government would not have the authority to sign much-needed contracts.</p>
      <p>Officials said a consensus was forming that would keep him at the helm of a transitional government, but he was likely to remain paralysed politically.</p>
      <p>Iraqi analyst Issam Faili said the divisions would continue to hamstring any "independent decision-making."</p>
      <p>"If you have a broad and solid political base, then you have room to manoeuvre," Faili said.</p>
      <p>"Abdel Mahdi is the victim of all the infighting around him."</p>
