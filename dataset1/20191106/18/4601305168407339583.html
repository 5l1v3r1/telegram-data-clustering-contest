      <h1>Liquid Wrench's dry lube for doors and hinges lubes doors and hinges well</h1>

      <p>I have been very happy <a href="https://amzn.to/36HAiI0">Liquid Wrench Lock and Hinge Lube</a>.</p>
      <p>The back lid on my Volkswagen Vanagon started sticking a few years ago. A responsible person who does things right would likely take the panels off, clean everything up and lubricate it with whatever factory stuff was used. I have just taken to spraying some of this dry lube in the locks and other mechanisms once every year or so.</p>
      <p>Doors and locks that were sticking or squeaky around the house have also been cured with one or two squirts of this 'ceflon' lubricant.</p>
      <p>The spray straw is billed as some kind of special design. It is a very useful straw for directing lube where you want it, like on every other can of spray lube I've seen since the 80s or 90s?</p>
      <p>Got sticky locks or squeaky hinges? This stuff is good.</p>
