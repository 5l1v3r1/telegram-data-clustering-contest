A police officer has been injured after she attempted to stop a vehicle which reversed along the pavement and crashed into a police vehicle.
She suffered leg and neck injuries but the driver failed to stop and drove off from the scene.
Met Police say the policewoman tried to stop an Alfa Romeo in Brent in north west London which was “being driven by a man suspected of driving whilst being disqualified” at 4.10pm today.
A spokesman said: “After the car stopped in Windermere Avenue, Wembley, it then reversed along the pavement and collided with a police vehicle.
“As a result, a female police officer, who was getting out of the vehicle suffered leg and neck injuries.”

The police officer was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to hospital.
Thankfully the spokesman said “her condition is not believed to be life-threatening”.
Police have made no arrests so far but “enquiries continue to locate the Alfa Romeo and the driver.”

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to call police on 101, quoting CAD 5316/06NOV, or tweet @MetCC. Information can also be given anonymously to Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
