      <h1>Andre Gomes sends first message to fans after undergoing surgery on horror ankle injury</h1>
      <h2>Andre Gomes was discharged from hospital two days after suffering a horrific ankle break - and now he has given a message to his supporters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:59:15+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Everton midfielder Andre Gomes has spoken for the first time since suffering a horrific ankle break.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international had surgery on Monday on the fracture dislocation of his right ankle that he suffered during the second half of Sunday's 1-1 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> following a challenge from Son Heung-min.</p>
      <p>Gomes fell awkwardly after being tackled from behind by Son, who was subsequently shown a red card - although that decision was overturned by the Football Association on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Korean forward was distraught when he saw the extent of the damage to Gomes and a number of other players were visibly shocked and upset.</p>

      <p>Now Gomes, the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> midfielder who sealed his permanent move to Everton in the summer, has taken to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to send a video message.</p>
      <p>In the video, which was captioned "Thank you for your unconditional support", he said: "Hi everyone. As you already know everything went well. I'm already at home with my family.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank you all for the support, messages and the positive enegry. Thank you."</p>
      <p>His message comes a day after he was discharged from hospital, with the midfielder now facing a long road to recovery.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> message from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> on Tuesday read: "Following a successful operation yesterday, Andre Gomes has now been discharged from hospital and will continue his rehabilitation under the care of our medical team."</p>
      <p>A statement from Everton on Monday said the operation had gone "extremely well" and that the 26-year-old was expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>Gomes is likely to be sidelined for between six months and a year.</p>
      <p>Everton manager Marco Silva had previously that the club would give Gomes and his family all the support they needed.</p>
      <p>"He is seriously injured but I am 100% sure Andre will become stronger as a football player and as a man because he is a fantastic lad, a fantastic professional," he added.</p>
