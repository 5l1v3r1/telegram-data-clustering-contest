Frustrated New York Jets’ fans were attacked on Instagram over the weekend by cornerback Darryl Roberts after a devastating loss to the winless Miami Dolphins — but head coach Adam Gase said Monday the team doesn’t plan to cut Roberts.
Roberts posted a profanity-laced rant to his Instagram Stories Sunday calling out the “fake a-- fans” after the Jets lost 26-18 to the Dolphins (1-7).
