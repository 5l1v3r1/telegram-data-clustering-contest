貿戰後效應重創「改革象徵」 深圳GDP死火史上最低

06 Nov 2019, 18:25

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】中國深圳統計局日前公佈了最新統計數據，顯示今年前三個季度的生產總值（GDP）按年增長為6.6%，而該市第三季度的GDP數據，經財經專家推算為年增長率5.15%，創下該市建市以來最慢增速的紀錄，陸媒為此驚呼「深圳失速」。分析認為，深圳經濟突然死火的原因，主要受中美貿易戰影響，此外中共對香港的打壓也有負面影響。
深圳市是中國大陸最早的改革開放試點城市，在過去數年間，經濟發展上一直保持着迅猛增長的勢頭，尤其在2018年該市的年GDP總量更超越香港，成爲了粵港澳大灣區的經濟總量龍頭城市，也成爲全國僅次上海、北京的中國經濟第三城。一時間，用深圳取代香港的論調甚囂塵上，甚至有人誇口，稱深圳將成為「整個地球的經濟中心」。然而，到了今年的第三季度，深圳的經濟發展勢頭卻出現了異乎尋常的重大逆轉。
當地時間11月5日晚間，深圳市統計局發佈了一份統計快報，顯示該市的前三季度GDP總量為18689.13億元，增長率僅為6.6%，與該市今年上半年7.4%的增幅相比，明顯下降了不少；與去年該市的前三季度8.1%的增速相比，更大幅下滑了1.5個百分點。
不僅如此，深圳官方今次還罕有地沒有公布第三季的單季GDP增速數據，這個反常現象引起了外界的警覺。隨後，有中國大陸的財經媒體，根據官方已發佈的深圳上半年和前三季的相關數據進行對照計算，最終推算出深圳今年第三季度GDP增幅僅為5.15%，仍為歷史新低。
對此，有陸媒驚呼「深圳失速」，多家媒體紛紛發文討論深圳今年經濟發展狀況大逆轉的原因，而中美貿易戰的影響和香港動盪的影響，是公認的導致深圳經濟逆轉的兩大主要原因。
被指立場親共的香港經濟日報日前援引中國綜合開發研究院旅遊與地產研究中心主任宋丁的觀點，分析了導致深圳經濟「急凍」的五大因素：
其一，中美貿易戰直接打擊了深圳的進出口葉。今年上半年的數據顯示，深圳進出口總額下降了0.9個百分點，其中進口總額下降了7.8%，這是多年來沒有過的現象。
有分析指出，深圳經濟的外向型程度非常高，其經濟發展嚴重依賴外貿。在外部環境好的時候，深圳比中國其他地區會更具活力，但在環境不利時也會受到更大的衝擊，比如中美貿易戰對依賴出口的深圳造成的打擊就比其對他城市的影響更大。
其二，美國政府對華爲、中興、大疆等深圳高科技企業的制裁，已波及到深圳的製造業，導致深圳的製造業處於低迷態勢，而且不排除這種低迷態勢還將持續相當一段時間。
其三，深圳的消費在一二線城市中一直偏弱。在外需偏弱時，深圳未能以內需來支撐經濟。
其四，受香港政局動盪的影響，深圳與香港關聯的服務業出現下滑。今年上半年，深圳的規模以上服務業增長率比去年同期下滑了7.4個百分點。
香港動盪對深圳旅遊業的打擊是一個比較典型的例子：過去中國大陸很多旅行團是經深圳赴香港的，現在受香港動盪局勢的影響，赴港旅遊直線下滑，深圳的過境團也大幅下滑。
其五，深圳的房地產領域存在結構失衡的問題。城市更新速度慢，周期長，直接拖累房企的業績和利潤數據。
上述五大因素裡，貿易戰和香港的動盪顯然是導致深圳經濟發展勢頭逆轉的最重要的也最直接的兩大原因。

Post-trade effect hits the ""reform of reform"" Shenzhen GDP is the lowest in the history of death

06 Nov 2019, 18:25

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 07, 2019] China's Shenzhen Statistics Bureau recently released the latest statistics showing that the gross domestic product (GDP) in the first three quarters of this year increased by 6.6% year-on-year, while the city's third quarter The GDP data, calculated by financial experts as an annual growth rate of 5.15%, set a record for the slowest growth rate since the city was established. Lu Media exclaimed ""Shenzhen stall"". The analysis believes that the cause of the sudden death of the Shenzhen economy is mainly affected by the Sino-US trade war, and the CCP’s suppression of Hong Kong has also had a negative impact.
Shenzhen is the earliest pilot city for reform and opening up in mainland China. In the past few years, the economic development has maintained a rapid growth momentum. Especially in 2018, the city's annual GDP exceeds Hong Kong and becomes the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Bay Area. The leading city of economic aggregate has also become the third city of China's economy in Shanghai and Beijing. For a time, the argument for replacing Hong Kong with Shenzhen was rampant, and some even boasted that Shenzhen would become ""the economic center of the entire planet."" However, in the third quarter of this year, there has been an unusually significant reversal of Shenzhen’s economic development momentum.
On the evening of November 5, local time, the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Statistics released a statistical report, showing that the city's total GDP for the first three quarters was 1,868.913 billion yuan, a growth rate of only 6.6%, compared with 7.4% in the first half of the year. Compared with the increase, it has dropped significantly. Compared with the growth rate of 8.1% in the first three quarters of last year, it has dropped by 1.5 percentage points.
Not only that, the Shenzhen official has rarely published the third quarter GDP growth rate data this time, this anomaly has caused the outside world to be alert. Subsequently, the financial media in mainland China conducted a comparative calculation based on the official data released in the first half of the year and the first three quarters of Shenzhen. It was finally calculated that the GDP growth in Shenzhen in the third quarter of this year was only 5.15%, still at a historical low.
In this regard, the mainland media exclaimed ""Shenzhen stall"", a number of media have issued a document to discuss the reasons for the great reversal of Shenzhen's economic development this year, and the impact of the Sino-US trade war and the impact of Hong Kong's turmoil is recognized as the cause of Shenzhen's economic reversal. Two main reasons.
The Hong Kong Economic Times, which has been accused of pro-community, recently cited the views of Song Ding, director of the China Development and Research Institute's Tourism and Real Estate Research Center, and analyzed the five factors that led to the “quick freeze” of the Shenzhen economy:
First, the Sino-US trade war directly hit the import and export leaves of Shenzhen. According to data from the first half of this year, the total volume of imports and exports in Shenzhen fell by 0.9 percentage points, of which the total import volume fell by 7.8%. This is a phenomenon that has not been seen for many years.
Some analysts pointed out that the degree of extroversion of Shenzhen's economy is very high, and its economic development relies heavily on foreign trade. When the external environment is good, Shenzhen will be more energetic than other parts of China, but it will also be more impacted when the environment is unfavorable. For example, the Sino-US trade war will hit the export-dependent Shenzhen more than its cities. The impact is even greater.
Second, the US government's sanctions against Shenzhen, high-tech companies such as Huawei, ZTE, and Dajiang have already affected the manufacturing industry in Shenzhen, which has led to a sluggish manufacturing industry in Shenzhen, and it is not ruled out that this downturn will continue for quite a while. time.
Third, Shenzhen's consumption has been weak in first- and second-tier cities. When external demand is weak, Shenzhen failed to support the economy with domestic demand.
Fourth, due to the turmoil in Hong Kong's political situation, the service industry associated with Shenzhen and Hong Kong has declined. In the first half of this year, the growth rate of service industries above designated size in Shenzhen fell by 7.4 percentage points over the same period last year.
The impact of Hong Kong's turmoil on Shenzhen's tourism industry is a typical example: in the past, many tour groups in mainland China went to Hong Kong via Shenzhen. Now, due to the turbulent situation in Hong Kong, tourism in Hong Kong has plummeted, and the transit group in Shenzhen has also fallen sharply.
Fifth, there is a structural imbalance in the real estate sector in Shenzhen. The urban renewal rate is slow and the cycle is long, which directly drags down the performance and profit data of the housing enterprises.
Among the above five factors, the trade war and the turmoil in Hong Kong are clearly the two most important and direct causes of the reversal of Shenzhen's economic development momentum.
