      <p>On Monday, Gase told reporters during a press conference phone call that the Jets spoke to Roberts about the incident but that they ultimately decided not to cut him, the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/jets-opt-not-to-cut-darryl-roberts-after-instagram-tirade/">New York Post</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Roberts comments came just days after the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> released defensive back <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/browns-jermaine-whitehead-apologizes-threats-social-media">Jermaine Whitehead</a> after he threatened fans and members of the media following a missed tackle during the team’s loss to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos.</a></p>
