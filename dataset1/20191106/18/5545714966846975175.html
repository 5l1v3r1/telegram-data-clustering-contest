      <p><i>Today's contest puts a Blu-ray copy of </i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw<i> up for grabs!</i></p>
      <p>I think I watched the first three Fast &amp; Furious movies, but lost track somewhere around Fast &amp; Furious in Space 2. They've really made a lot of those movies at this point. The good news is, they've embraced the full-on action aspects of the whole thing and actually look like a really good time, these days.</p>
      <p>So, they're already on spin-offs! For what it's worth, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are great, and look like they have a ton of chemistry in this one. So, give <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> a chance and enjoy some good old-fashioned, action-oriented car porn!</p>

      <p>Someone sped off with my ability to summarize movies, so I'm going to paste in some press info and get over into the merge lane.</p>
      <blockquote>For years, hulking lawman Luke Hobbs and lawless outcast Deckard Shaw have traded smack talk and body blows. But when cyber-genetically enhanced anarchist Brixton Lorr (Idris Elba) gains control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever, Hobbs and Shaw must partner up to bring down the only guy who might be badder than themselves. Joining the cast as Shaw's sister Hattie, Vanessa Kirby.</blockquote>
      <p>"Hobbs &amp; Shaw" sounds like a comic strip from the 80s/90s. I'd totally read it.</p>

The number of winners to be selected in a specific Contest will be posted on the applicable Contest site. The odds of being selected as a potential winner depend on the number of eligible entries received during the Entry Period. Potential winners will be contacted via email and will be asked to provide their full name, age and mailing address within a specified time period. If a potential winner does not respond within the timeframe stated in the notification email, we may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from all entries received during the Entry Period.

The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. In case of a dispute as to the owner of an entry, entry will be deemed to have been submitted by the authorized account holder of the screen name from which the entry is made. The authorized account holder is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.<br/><br/><b>9.Release and Limitations of Liability:</b> By participating in the Contest, entrants agree to release and hold harmless the Contest Entities from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Contest or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Contest; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone or network lines; © printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Contest or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Contest or receipt of any prize.
