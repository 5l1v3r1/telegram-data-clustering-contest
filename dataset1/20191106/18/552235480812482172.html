      <h2>Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted his party will not enter a pact with the SNP - and challenged them to back their programme for government.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:25:21+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/labour-mp-sir-lindsay-hoyle-20812044">Labour</a> will not do a deal with the SNP to get into power at Westminster, the party’s Scottish leader Richard Leonard insisted.</p>
      <p>Launching his campaign yesterday, Leonard ruled out any pact after the election on December 12 - and dared the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/nicola-sturgeon-visits-rutherglen-general-20824568">SNP</a> to vote against a Jeremy Corbyn programme for government.</p>
      <p>It follows suggestions <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-intends-hold-second-20822606">Nicola Sturgeon</a> would be happy to prop up a Labour minority government on a case by case basis.</p>

      <p>Leonard said: “There will be no deals with the SNP.</p>
      <p>“There is no pact with the SNP, there will be no deals with the SNP, there will be no coalition with the SNP.</p>
      <p>“We’re standing in this election to form a majority Labour government.”</p>
      <p>The MSP also warned the SNP could be punished by voters if they choose to vote down their Queen’s Speech setting out legislative plans to MPs.</p>
      <p>“If we are a minority Labour government, we would draft a Queen’s Speech and it would then be up to the SNP whether they voted for that progressive, transformative Queen’s Speech or not,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If they did not vote for it, they would have to answer to the people of Scotland.”</p>

      <p>Leonard set out his position to journalists after a campaign launch speech to a well-attended audience at Maryhill.</p>
      <p>Labour candidates and activists appeared enthusiastic about the party’s chances in a city full of knife-edge local battles.</p>
      <p>Leonard promoted UK Labour policies including nationalised rail, restoration of free TV licences for older people, getting rid of Universal Credit and tackling “food bank Britain”.</p>
      <p>He attacked the “idle rich” in the bitter row over Asda workers’ rights.</p>
      <p>And he said: “In this election we are offering hope out of despair. And let me be clear that it is only a Jeremy Corbyn Government that will rescue our communities and our people from the hard years of austerity.</p>
      <p>“It is only a Jeremy Corbyn Government that will reverse this rising inequality. Only a Labour Government will make sure that the wealth in the economy is shared far more equally.</p>
      <p>“This general election is about the direction of political travel in this country. It is a battle for votes and seats but it is also about what kind of society we are and what kind of society we want to be.”</p>

      <p>Leonard insisted the election is not a “proxy vote” on the constitution.</p>
      <p>But he sidestepped a question on a potential second independence referendum, only claiming he’d stop the SNP getting a majority at the 2021 Holyrood election.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the speech, Leonard announced a major housing policy - but he admitted it depends entirely on the SNP Government at Holyrood following his lead.</p>
      <p>Labour want to invest £70 billion in public services in Scotland and build 120,000 new council homes.</p>
      <p>Housing is devolved to Holyrood, meaning it would be up to the current SNP administration to decide whether to spend money on the Labour target.</p>
      <p>The campaign launch began with a speech by social justice campaigner Sean Bailey who told the audience he supported independence in 2014 - and might do it again.</p>
      <p>He said: "I campaigned for a Yes vote. I’m not ashamed of that. But I stand here today campaigning for the Labour party, for a Labour government for the very same principles, the very same ideas.”</p>
