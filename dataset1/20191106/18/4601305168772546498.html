      <p>Rixeyville, Virginia's Little Fork Volunteer Technical Large Animal Rescue Team saved a horse who fell or jumped into a family's swimming pool overnight. When the team arrived, the fire department had already begun draining the pool and a firefighter had jumped in to keep the animal calm. After a vet sedated the horse, the Rescue Team used a sling attached to a tractor and lifted the horse out of the pool. From <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/crime_courts/little-fork-large-animal-rescue-saves-horse-stuck-in-pool/article_1e14e1cb-2fff-5fe3-b891-be3c6f09840e.html">Fredericksburg.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The area had experienced high winds and a line of storms the night prior, Halloween night, and “Annie” a Haflinger had escaped from her field and went exploring, according to a Facebook post from Little Fork Volunteer Technical Large Animal Rescue Team.<br/><br/>The horse was probably thirsty and saw some water and “just like that” found herself in the swimming pool, the post stated.</blockquote>
      <p>Shortly after the rescue, Annie had recovered and was happily eating breakfast.</p>
