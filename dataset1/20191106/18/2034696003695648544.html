        <b>"I know that I'm still perfect the way that I am"</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a> has opened up about her ongoing mental health struggles, saying that “it’s okay not to feel amazing all the time”.</p>
      <p>The artist, whose real name is Tahlia Barnet, spoke to BBC Radio 1’s Annie Mac following the release of her <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-fka-twigss-jittering-new-song-sad-day-2564446">new single ‘Sad Day</a>‘. During the chat, twigs explained that she’s become more at ease with herself in recent years.</p>

      <p>“It’s becoming apparent as I get older and as I get to know myself, it’s okay not to feel amazing all the time,” she told Mac.</p>
      <p>“It’s okay for me, as a woman of colour, not to feel like a Nubian queen all the time, who’s perfectly sitting on my throne of greatness.”</p>
      <p>twigs continued: “It’s just not my reality, but yet I know that I’m still perfect the way that I am, and I know that I still can do whatever I want, and I can dream big and I can achieve my dreams. And that has nothing to do with my completeness in the moment.”</p>

      <p>Referring to the lyrics “<i>I’ve never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi</i>” from her track ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fka-twigs-breaks-free-enchanting-home-video-2554610">Home With You</a>‘, the singer revealed the meaning behind the line.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s what I mean by ‘I’ve never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi.’ I haven’t,” she said, “and now in this age where we’re obsessed with superheroes and all these huge franchises making these amazing big films, I’m yet to see a female character who is beautifully strong and perfect and flawed and is a full range.”</p>
      <p>Twigs went on to say that “even our idea of what a pop star is or idea of what a female icon is is often very complete.”</p>
      <p>FKA twigs’ <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fka-twigs-announces-anticipated-second-album-magdalene-2546098">second album ‘MAGDALENE</a>’, meanwhile, is set to arrive this Friday. The project marks her first full-length record in five years and follows on from <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-various-artists-15522">2014’s ‘LP1</a>’.</p>
