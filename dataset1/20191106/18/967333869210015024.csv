Rise and Shine: Little Turtle Helps Its Friend Wake Up
Animals can at times be really good friends and ready to help each other in times of need. Also, since they don’t have alarm clocks, it’s extra important for them to remember to wake each other up.

These two turtles probably have plans, so they have to get up and go as fast as possible to where they need to be if they want to make it in time. Unfortunately, one of the critters is still snoozing, so the second one touches its pal’s face in order to wake it up. Don’t be so lazy, little turtle - you have a lot of things to do!
