      <h1>Two arrested for theft at OR Tambo during Springbok celebrations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:17:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>Gauteng police have arrested two suspects for theft at OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>This is after several Springbok supporters, who were at the airport to welcome the 2019 Rugby World Cup champions, were robbed of their cellphones, bags and other belongings.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Colonel Athlenda Mathe said it was unfortunate the suspects had exploited the historic event for personal gain.</p>
      <p>She added the police would ensure that all those who were involved in criminal activity would be  brought to book. </p>
      <p>"A number of cases were reported relating to theft. We are working alongside airport security to follow up on leads to effect more arrests," Mathe said.</p>
      <p>Among the victims was eNCA journalist Khayelihle Khumalo who told News24 he had left his backpack with a colleague and was crossing live to the channel, giving updates on the scenes at the airport.</p>
      <p>He said when he had finished, his bag was gone. </p>
      <p>Khumalo added his passport, car keys, ID and other valuables were in it.</p>
      <p>"I was devastated and really astounded because it was a euphoric environment I didn't expect stuff to be stolen, it's a tragedy," he said. </p>
      <p>Mathe said 14 cases were reported to the police at the airport and not 40, as some reports suggested.</p>
      <p>The police have encouraged other victims who fell prey to the criminals to report it as soon as possible.</p>
