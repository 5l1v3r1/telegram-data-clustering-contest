        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams</b>: AmaZulu and Stellenbosch FC</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 06 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Princess Magogo Stadium</p>
      <p>AmaZulu will be seeking to get away from the drop zone when they host Stellenbosch FC in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday evening at Princess Magogo Stadium.</p>
      <p>Usuthu have found a new lease of life under Jozef Vukusic, who has managed to clinch two victories in their last two games.</p>
      <p>Usuthu beat Cape Town City 2-1 at home and Baroka FC 1-0 away to get off the foot of the table, as they moved up to second-from-bottom with eight points from nine matches.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Stellies are also enjoying a good run of form as they are unbeaten in their last four matches, with their last encounter ending in a crucial 1-0 win over Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>The sides last met officially in the National First Division (now known as GladAfrica Championship) in the 2016/17 season, where Stellies won the first-round before Usuthu claimed victory in the return fixture.</p>
