        <b>It’s no secret sports stars have to put up with hecklers on a daily basis, whether they’re insulting their performance, appearance, or anything at all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They shouldn’t have to put up with it, but they do. Because let’s face it, it’s always going to happen when fans – usually on the losing team – get riled up and frustrated things aren’t going their way.</p>
      <p>LeBron James, however, had the perfect response to one particular heckler last night, November 5, as the Chicago Bulls fan decided to heckle the basketball player and his teammate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rather than let the fan get away with it, LeBron had the perfect response:</b>

      <p>Looking calmly at the heckler with a smile on his face, the sports star simply said, ‘Your lady embarrassed to be with you,’ before grabbing his towel and walking off.</p>
      <p>His teammate Anthony Davis, who had also been targeted by the frustrated fan, continued to look at the riled-up audience as fans continued to shout insults at him, with security eventually getting involved.</p>
      <p>James was helping to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 118-112 victory against the Chicago Bulls when the heckler made his comments – but he soon showed them who was boss.</p>

      <p>LeBron finished the game with his third consecutive triple-double with 30 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds – becoming the first Laker to do so in more than three decades.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the achievement, the official Lakers account tweeted: ‘First Laker with three straight triple-doubles in 32 years. All hail the King’. Retweeting the news, LeBron added: ‘#WashedKing’ – letting his haters know he heard them loud and clear.</p>
      <p>‘Washed’ is a reference to the insults thrown his way throughout the game; although it’s not clear exactly who was calling him washed, <i><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/washed-king-lakers-lebron-james-pokes-fun-at-haters-after-historic-third-straight-triple-double/">CBS Sports</a></i> reports there have been discussions about whether the basketball player is too far past his prime to carry his Lakers team to a title.</p>

      <p>So far, he’s proving all the haters wrong, having helped his team rack up six consecutive wins to claim the best record in the league. Pretty impressive, huh?</p>
      <p>While the basketball player continues to make history, I can only imagine his heckler is still angrily muttering away somewhere about how his team were the true winners and LeBron was simply ‘lucky’ on the court. Sure.</p>
      <p>Keep doing you, LeBron.</p>
