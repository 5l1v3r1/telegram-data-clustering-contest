      <p>Katie Price has been 'begging' for a role in a Christmas pantomime, according to pals, who say she's also demanding a £1million fee for her appearance.</p>
      <p>Cash-strapped Katie dodged bankruptcy twice last year and is reportedly looking for a deal that will give her finances a boost</p>
      <p>Sources say she's even contacted long-term pal Rylan Clark Neal to see if he knows a contact that can get her a way in.</p>
      <p>Rylan is starring in the celeb-packed Nativity! The Musical over the festive period, alongside with Danny and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-dani-dyer-danny-dyers-12610907">Dani Dyer</a> .</p>

      <p>While Katie is no stranger to treading the boards herself. Her last appearance came as the Wicked Fairy in Seeping Beauty back in 2015.</p>
      <p>It was reported at the time she was paid a £100,000 appearance fee for her time at the New Victoria Theatre in Woking.</p>
      <p>But the former glamour model is hoping to thrash out a better deal this time, say insiders.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun: "She knows they can be big money for soap stars and celebs, and thinks she could land a £1m fee. She says she's got the voice and loads of people would pay to see her be Cinderella.</p>
      <p>“The problem is, she's got a reputation as being flaky and she's not exactly a squeaky clean family friendly name anymore after the arrests and the drugs she's admitted taking. She's gutted she hasn't landed a role this year," the insider claimed.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted representatives of Katie for comment.</p>

      <p>Last year it was reported that Coleen Nolan was the highest paid panto star, reportedly taking home around £200k for her role as the Fairy Godmother in Bradford's Cinderella.</p>
      <p>While comedian Julian Clary was also alleged to have netted a similar figure for his part in Dick Whittington at the London Paladium.</p>
