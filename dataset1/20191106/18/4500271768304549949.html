      <p>Scores of visually impaired people continued their protest sit-in for the third consecutive day on Wednesday in Lahore, demanding the government to ensure a "regularised livelihood" for them.</p>
      <p>Umar Rasheed, a leader of the protesters and president of a union of "blind daily wagers" in Punjab, while speaking to <i>Dawn.com</i> said that the government has been ignoring their demand since day one.</p>
      <p>He said the one-point agenda of the protesters was "regularised livelihood" for all visually impaired people across the province.</p>
      <p>He said that some 1,000 visually impaired persons hired as daily-wage employees in various departments of the provincial government receive their salaries after an interval of several months and are not assigned any work in their respective departments.</p>
      <p>The visually impaired daily wagers are not assigned any designation either, Rasheed said, adding that the entire scenario betrays that the daily wagers programme is a "temporary" arrangement.</p>
      <p>According to Rasheed, the protesters are demanding the regularisation of employment for the daily wagers and provision of livelihood to jobless visually impaired people.</p>
      <p>He said instead of government officials, only police officers were approaching them with mere assurances and intimidation. He said that a day earlier they intercepted the vehicle of provincial minister Fayyazul Hassan Chohan outside Chief Minister House but instead of engaging the protesters in talks, the minister changed his route.</p>
      <p>The protest leader said that more than 100 visually impaired people are taking part in today's protest.</p>
