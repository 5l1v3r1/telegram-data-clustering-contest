      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Democratic U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley has officially endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren for President in 2020. </p>
      <p>In the short video released Wednesday, Pressley explained her move to endorse Warren.</p>
      <p>“At a time when so many people find their lives threatened and their dreams denied, we need bold, compassionate leaders who put power back in the hands of people. I am so grateful to call Elizabeth Warren a friend, a partner in good, and my Senator. I am proud to endorse her candidacy for President,” said Representative Pressley. </p>
      <p>“Elizabeth listens to the voices of community; in church basements and in packed gymnasiums, she has heard the stories of families who are struggling, and she has responded with activism, visionary policies, and community-led plans. From fighting to erase income inequality and close the racial wealth gap, to taking on the epidemic of gun violence and working to dismantle structural racism, Elizabeth has made it her life’s work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people. We find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it.”    </p>

      </p>
      <p>On Monday, Pressley told the Associated Press she's been approached by top Democrats including the campaigns of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden, but when asked when she'll endorse, she said, "I'll move when I move."</p>
      <p>Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, fellow members of the "squad" — Democratic freshmen female representatives of color who have been sharp critics of President Donald Trump — are backing Sanders. </p>
      <p>Pressley will now join Warren on the campaign trail on Thursday in North Carolina and participate in a town hall discussion at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.</p>
