      <p>These two turtles probably have plans, so they have to get up and go as fast as possible to where they need to be if they want to make it in time. Unfortunately, one of the critters is still snoozing, so the second one touches its pal’s face in order to wake it up. Don’t be so lazy, little turtle - you have a lot of things to do!</p>
