Apple TV Plus continues to roll out its slate of original content and this time, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) stars!
Well, OK, he appears in the trailer for M. Night Shyamalan’s Servant for about ten seconds.
The Servant, meanwhile, looks to be a very, very, very creepy show about a nanny working for a family. The catch? The kid she’s looking after isn’t a baby, but a human-like doll. The family’s young son died at 13 weeks, and the doll is the only thing keeping the wife together. Oh, also there is something real weird with the nanny herself. Is she a demon? Vengeful spirit? Something else entirely?
In addition to Rupert Grint, Servant stars Nell Tiger Free (Myrcella Baratheon in Game of Thrones) as creepy nanny, Toby Kebbell (Kong Skull Island) as enabling husband, and Lauren Ambrose as the grieving wife.
Servant airs on Apple TV Plus on Nov. 28.
