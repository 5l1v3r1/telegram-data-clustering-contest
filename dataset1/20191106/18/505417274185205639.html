        <b>Irish underage international Ryan Johansson found the net twice for Bayern Munich’s U19s in their 6-0 UEFA Youth League victory over Olympiacos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johansson didn’t start the game but after coming on at half-time with Bayern 1-0 up, he found the net twice as the German side ran riot over their Greek opponents.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old grabbed his first goal, cutting inside from the left and striking a sweet shot past the Olympiacos goalkeeper, with his second coming from a darting run into the box to meet a cross from the right-hand side.</p>

      <p>Johansson was born in Luxembourg to a Swedish father and a mother who grew up in Mullingar and he is eligible to play for the Boys in Green thanks to his maternal grandparents.</p>
      <p>His eligibility was thrown into doubt a few months ago however when he outlined in an interview with Swedish publication <a href="https://www.expressen.se/sport/fotboll/bayerns-superlofte-nara-valja-sveriges-landslag/"><u>expressen.se</u>,</a> that he and the FAI were trying to clarify an issue with his passport <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/ryan-johansson-fifa-ireland-passport/">with his father explaining that he didn’t have an Irish one when he first represented Luxembourg at underage level.</a></p>
      <p>Johansson is keen to represent Ireland at international level and a source close to the player outlined to <i>Pundit Arena</i> that FIFA have spoken to the FAI regarding their decision over his eligibility case, and that a resolution is expected ‘very very soon.’</p>

      <p>Losing Johansson would be a blow for Ireland given his clear talent and desire to play for the Boys in Green at international level.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are also in Bayern’s group in the competition and minus fellow Irish underage international Troy Parrott, they were defeated 2-0 by Red Star Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Parrott is in the senior squad for their clash against the Serbian side and is expected to be named on the bench.</p>
