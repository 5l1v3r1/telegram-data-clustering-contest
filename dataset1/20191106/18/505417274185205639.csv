Irish U19 International Ryan Johansson Grabs Brace For Bayern In UEFA Youth League
06 Nov 2019, 18:44 by Oisin McQueirns

Irish underage international Ryan Johansson found the net twice for Bayern Munich’s U19s in their 6-0 UEFA Youth League victory over Olympiacos.

Johansson didn’t start the game but after coming on at half-time with Bayern 1-0 up, he found the net twice as the German side ran riot over their Greek opponents.
The 18-year-old grabbed his first goal, cutting inside from the left and striking a sweet shot past the Olympiacos goalkeeper, with his second coming from a darting run into the box to meet a cross from the right-hand side.



Johansson was born in Luxembourg to a Swedish father and a mother who grew up in Mullingar and he is eligible to play for the Boys in Green thanks to his maternal grandparents.
His eligibility was thrown into doubt a few months ago however when he outlined in an interview with Swedish publication expressen.se, that he and the FAI were trying to clarify an issue with his passport with his father explaining that he didn’t have an Irish one when he first represented Luxembourg at underage level.
Johansson is keen to represent Ireland at international level and a source close to the player outlined to Pundit Arena that FIFA have spoken to the FAI regarding their decision over his eligibility case, and that a resolution is expected ‘very very soon.’



Losing Johansson would be a blow for Ireland given his clear talent and desire to play for the Boys in Green at international level.
Tottenham are also in Bayern’s group in the competition and minus fellow Irish underage international Troy Parrott, they were defeated 2-0 by Red Star Belgrade.
Parrott is in the senior squad for their clash against the Serbian side and is expected to be named on the bench.
