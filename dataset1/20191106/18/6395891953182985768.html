      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Prosecutors in the trial of longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone told jurors Wednesday they will prove that Stone lied multiple times before congressional committees.</p>
      <p>Stone is accused of lying to lawmakers about his attempts to communicate with the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, tampering with witnesses and obstructing a House Intelligence Committee investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Stone was indicted in January as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian electoral tampering.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told jurors in a Washington courtroom that Stone "wanted to hide what he had done because the truth looked bad."</p>
      <p>Zelinsky said jurors would hear testimony from Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and from Rick Gates, the associate of Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , who has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>
