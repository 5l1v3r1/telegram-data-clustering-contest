입력 2019.11.07 03:11 | 수정 2019.11.07 07:36 영국 보건부 장관은 아이 넷을 둔 엄마다. 암을 두 차례나 겪은(undergo cancer twice) '환자 출신'이다. 평범한 주부(ordinary housewife)였던 그녀가 정계에 발을 들인(enter the political arena) 것은 다른 사람들도 역경을 이겨내도록 돕고(help others beat the odds) 싶다는 생각에서였다.조 처칠(55) 장관은 2009년 두 번째 암 진단을 받았다. 이번엔 끝인가 보다 하고 최악 상황을 준비했다(plan for the worst). 네 딸에게 남기는 편지를 써놓고 장례식을 준비했다(arrange for her own funeral). 남편에게는 새 아내를 구하라고 했다. 딸들을 위해서라도 그렇게 해달라고 했다. 웨딩드레스 골라줄 엄마가 필요하다고 설득했다.



24년 전 처음 갑상선암 진단을 받았을(be diagnosed with thyroid cancer) 때는 서른한 살이었다. 딸 둘 키우며 알콩달콩 살다가 청천벽력 같은(like a bolt out of the blue) 통고를 받았다. 피곤한 느낌이 들어(feel run down) 병원에 가봤는데 ""마음의 준비를 하라(prepare yourself for death)""고 했다.수술 후 천우신조로 목숨을 건졌다(escape death by the grace of God). 얼마 후엔 이상 없다는 진단을 받았다(get the all-clear). 셋째를 가져보기로(have a go at a third child) 했다. 아들일 것 같았다. 딸 쌍둥이였다. 딸 넷이 됐다.두 번째 벼락을 맞았다(be struck by the second thunderbolt). 이번엔 유방암(breast cancer)이었다. 맏딸이 열일곱, 둘째가 열여섯, 쌍둥이가 열세 살일 때였다. 태연한 척했다(put on a brave face). 낮에 아이들 앞에선 그랬다. 그러고는 밤새 눈이 퉁퉁 붓도록 울었다(weep her eyes out).오른쪽 수술을 받았다. 재수술을 받아야(go through a second operation) 했다. 설상가상(as if to rub salt into the wound) 왼쪽도 받으라고 했다. 암으로 발전하는 종양(pre-cancerous tumor)이 발견됐다. 그 와중에 방사선 치료를 받아가며 일해야(carry on working) 했다. 갑상선암 때 보험 혜택을 봤기 때문에 이번엔 본인 돈을 들여야 한다고 했다.이건 아니다 싶었다. 분노가 치밀었다(feel her heart swelling with indignation). 죽더라도 바꿔놓고 죽어야겠다고 마음먹었다. 분노를 보건 캠페인으로 승화시켜(sublimate her fury into health campaigning) 암 자선 단체에서 활동하다가 2014년 하원 의원에 당선됐다. 그러고 얼마 전 보건부 장관으로 임명된 것이다.취임 직후부터(shortly after taking office) 조기 진단·치료를 개선하고(improve early diagnosis and treatment) 생존율을 높이기 위해(in a bid to heighten survival rates) 직접 의료 현장을 발로 뛰고 있다. ""제가 직접 보고 겪은(see and experience first-hand) 것들이어서 환부 도려내듯(cut out the affected area) 수술할 수 있습니다. 두 번이나 암을 겪어 봤기 때문에 어떤 것이 암적인 요소인지 누구보다 잘 압니다.""

[Yun Hee-young's News] The daughter who was a cancer patient
06 Nov 2019, 18:11 by Chosun Ilbo Editor, Hee-young Yoon
Enter 2019.11.07 03:11 | UK Health Minister is a mother with four children. Undergo cancer twice 'patient origin'. As an ordinary housewife, she entered the political arena because she wanted to help others beat the odds. I was diagnosed with a second cancer. This time, I was ready for the worst. Arranged for her daughter, she prepared a funeral. My husband told me to get a new wife. I asked her to do it for my daughters. I convinced her that she needed a wedding dress.



He was thirty years old when he was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer 24 years ago. While raising her two daughters, she was notified like a bolt out of the blue. I went to the hospital to feel run down and said, “prepare yourself for death.” He died after the surgery (escape death by the grace of God). After a while, I was diagnosed with no problem (get the all-clear). I had a go at a third child. It seemed to be a son. Daughter twins. Became four daughters, be struck by the second thunderbolt. This time it was breast cancer. The eldest daughter was seventeen, the second sixteen, and the twins were thirteen years old. Put on a brave face. It was before the children during the day. Then weeped her eyes out all night and had the right surgery. Go through a second operation. To make matters worse, as if to rub salt into the wound. Pre-cancerous tumors have been found. In the meantime, they had to carry on radiation. Since I had insurance coverage for thyroid cancer, I told myself that I had to spend my money this time. Feel her heart swelling with indignation. Even if I die, I changed my mind and decided to die. Sublimate her fury into health campaigning, she worked for a cancer charity and was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014. He was recently appointed Minister of Health, shortly after taking office, to improve early diagnosis and treatment, and in a bid to heighten survival rates. I'm kicking. ""I see and experience first-hand, so I can cut out the affected area. I've had cancer twice so I know better than anyone what's cancerous.""
