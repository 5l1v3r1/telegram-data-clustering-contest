      <h1>End of the road for Gabuza with the EFF</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:48:26+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mandisa Nyathi</a></address>
      <p>The EFF member who stood up to the leadership’s attempt to bully her into signing a letter ceding her place on the party’s parliamentary list to the leadership’s preferred choice has been permanently axed from the party following her unsuccessful appeal.</p>
      <p>Lungile Gabuza, who was a member of the KwaZulu-Natal provincial command team, was informed of her failed appeal on Wednesday following her expulsion from the party for refusing to follow instructions.</p>
      <p>City Press reported on the initial expulsion that occurred on October 11 after what Gabuza described as a “predetermined” disciplinary hearing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The expulsion letter, seen by City Press, confirmed that Gabuza was no longer a member of the party.</p>
      <p>“The aforementioned entails that the findings of the national disciplinary committee of appeal and ratification of the central command team to expel you is upheld, with the same sanction/sentence of immediate expulsion from the EFF remaining effective. You are therefore hereby informed of the immediate termination of your membership of the EFF,” reads the letter from EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee.</p>
      <p>The expulsion letter coincided with the parliamentary swearing in of Omphile Maotwe on Wednesday, who is believed to be the party hierarchy favourite.</p>
      <p>Maotwe was sworn in with Luvuyo Tafeni as the two new MPs representing the red berets in the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Speaking to City Press, Gabuza questioned the timing of Maotwe’s ordination.</p>
      <p>“It’s strange that even before I received the response Maotwe had been sworn in,” Gabuza said.</p>
      <p>She added that EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu had promised that the central command team would revert back to her.</p>
      <p>“We told Floyd that the way in which the hearing was done was unfair. He said he would apply his mind and send a response in 24 hours”</p>
      <p>For Gabuza, the hearing was a facade, after she allegedly heard Gardee confirming that the appeal would not succeed.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday Gardee answered a call from [EFF leader Julius] Malema saying: ‘We will send her a dismissal letter at 2pm tomorrow. She didn’t bring a lawyer, she just came with her representative,’” said Gabuza</p>
      <p>Previously, Gabuza told City Press that the reason for appealing the matter was because she was not given an opportunity to prove her case fairly.</p>
      <p>“The way the hearing was conducted, you could see that whether Gabuza abided by the organisation’s rules or not the outcome would have been the same,” she said.</p>
