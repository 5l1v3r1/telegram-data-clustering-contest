06 Nov 2019, 18:31 by Stephen Hall
See is one of many new offerings on Apple’s new Apple TV+ streaming service, and at launch, only 3 of its 8 total episodes were available to stream. Now that you’ve watched all three, you might be wondering when you can expect to get more of Jason Momoa, Sylvia Hoeks, Alfre Woodard, and more. Here’s when you should expect episode 4 of ‘See’ to air on Apple TV+.
When will I be able to stream episodes 4-8 of ‘See’ on Apple TV+?
Apple has announced that the remaining seven episodes of See will be available on Apple TV+ on a weekly basis — starting on November 8th with episode 4.

See episode 4: November 8, 2019
See episode 5: November 15, 2019
See episode 6: November 22, 2019
See episode 7: November 29, 2019
See episode 8: December 6, 2019

What time is See episode 4 going to be available?
