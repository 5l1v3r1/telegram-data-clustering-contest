      <p>A weirdo who pestered three teenagers at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cops-make-44-arrests-trnsmt-18262238">TRNSMT</a> music festival and pretended to be an undercover <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-rush-scene-after-man-20824817">police</a> officer has been fined £750.</p>
      <p>Stuart Robertson also pictured the 16-year-olds with his phone and followed them through Glasgow Green in July this year.</p>
      <p>A hearing was told that Robertson was clutching a "hot dog" in his other hand at the time.</p>

      <p>The 40-year-old pleaded guilty last month at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/thieves-target-asian-gold-cash-20824858">Glasgow</a> Sheriff Court to impersonating a police officer.</p>
      <p>The court heard Robertson was drunk when he approached the trio at 11pm.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Rachel Meechan said: “Robertson said he was an undercover police officer.</p>
      <p>“The teenagers ignored him but he said: ‘I’m serious, I’m an undercover police officer and don’t start your s**t.’</p>
      <p>“He took out his phone and pointed it at them and appeared to film and photograph them.”</p>

      <p>Robertson was arrested by officers and replied “I didn’t do anything” when charged.</p>
      <p>Lawyer, Nicky Matteo, said: “This a very bizarre situation, he was drunk that day and this was immature.</p>
      <p>“He had his phone charger and a hot dog in his other hand and this was how he presented himself.</p>
      <p>“He is remorseful and appalled.”</p>
      <p>Robertson, from Airdrie, was ordered to pay £750 compensation to the teenagers by Sheriff Paul Brown.</p>
      <p>A community payback order was put on Robertson in which he will be under social work supervision for 12 months.</p>
