Injury latest
Kieran Gibbs broke his toe in training over the last international break, but it is not a major problem.
He missed the Stoke game but could be on the bench against Hull.



Gareth Barry missed the end of last season after undergoing surgery on his knee. His contract was up this past summer, but he has finally penned a new contract and can play for West Bromwich Albion after a financial issue with Everton was resolved.
Albion and Everton had been locked in talks for several weeks over the final payment owed to the Merseyside club to extend Barry’s Hawthorns tenure into a third season. But a breakthrough in the impasse has enabled Barry, 38, to sign a new deal with the Baggies that will run until the end of the season.
In terms of suspensions, Nathan Ferguson served the first of a three-match ban against Stoke - and he will also sit out the Hull and Sheffield Wednesday games.
His return will be pencilled in for Bristol City at The Hawthorns at the end of next month.
