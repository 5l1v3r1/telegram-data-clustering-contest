      <p>Chris Brown says he is having a high-end garage sale at his Los Angeles home, and a crowd has been gathering for hours.</p>
      <p>The singer posted a flyer on his Instagram and Twitter accounts that included his home address in the Tarzana neighbourhood, and says the event started at 10am Wednesday and will go on until 7pm.</p>
      <p>The flyer says the sale will feature “significantly marked-down high-end designer items”.</p>

      <p>He captioned the posts: “DA CRIB … 2 day event.”</p>
      <p>People began gathering at the house on Tuesday night, and a long line stretched down the pavement of the residential neighbourhood before the event Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The house was the site of one of Brown’s many run-ins with the law, a 2016 police standoff that ended with his arrest.</p>
