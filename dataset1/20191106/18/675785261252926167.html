      <h1>Schiphol Airport locked down after plane hijack button 'pressed by mistake'</h1>
      <h2>Air Europa confirmed this evening that a pilot on board a flight bound for Madrid accidentally pressed a button which alerts authorities about a suspected hijacking</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:58:29+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:58</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>One of Europe's busiest airports was placed on lock down this evening after a hijack button was pressed 'by mistake'.</p>
      <p>Police swarmed to Schiphol Airport this evening after reports of a suspected hijacking during boarding of an Air Europa plane.</p>
      <p>The hijacking alert was triggered by a pilot who pressed “send” by accident while explaining to an intern what the transponder codes are for, according to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, citing sources. </p>
      <p>At least 27 passengers were on board when the hijacking alert was reportedly triggered.</p>
      <p>Some flights at the airport were grounded, according to a passenger on a plane that had been due to take off this evening.</p>

      <p>A so-called Grip 3 report was issued by special forces in the Netherlands, reports De Telegraaf.</p>
      <p>This happens with 'an incident or serious event with major consequences for the population'.</p>
      <p>At 7.43pm (UK time) Dutch special forces said that all the crew and passengers were safely off the aircraft.</p>
      <p>The pilot of a departing flight activated a hijacking alert during the boarding process, according to Dutch broadcaster NOS, citing sources with the military police.</p>
      <p>Air Europa have since confirmed this was 'a mistake'.</p>
      <p>Various gates are closed at the airport and passengers are being kept at a distance.</p>
      <p>"There is a suspicious situation and that’s all I can say,” a spokesman for the military police said before the 'mistake' was clear.</p>
      <p>Pete Martin wrote on Twitter: "Stuck on a plane just landed at Schiphol.</p>
      <p>"We are waiting on the runaway taxing area. Just been told by captain about a serious incident."</p>
