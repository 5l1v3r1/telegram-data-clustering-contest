      <p>A police officer has been injured after she attempted to stop a vehicle which reversed along the pavement and crashed into a police vehicle.</p>
      <p>She suffered leg and neck injuries but the driver failed to stop and drove off from the scene.</p>
      <p>Met Police say the policewoman tried to stop an Alfa Romeo in Brent in north west London which was “being driven by a man suspected of driving whilst being disqualified” at 4.10pm today.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “After the car stopped in Windermere Avenue, Wembley, it then reversed along the pavement and collided with a police vehicle.</p>
      <p>“As a result, a female police officer, who was getting out of the vehicle suffered leg and neck injuries.”</p>
