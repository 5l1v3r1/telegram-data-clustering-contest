06 Nov 2019, 18:16 by Digital Staff
Outgoing Independent MP Sylvia Hermon will not defend her North Down seat, she has confirmed.
Lady Sylvia took the seat in 2001 as an Ulster Unionist and left the party in 2010 to sit as an independent unionist.
She said it had been ""the greatest honour of my life"" to represent North Down.
""Serving as an MP is a tremendous privilege and I remain profoundly grateful to all those who placed their trust and confidence in me in the last five general elections,"" she said.
""It has undoubtedly been the greatest honour of my life to serve the people of North Down as their Member of Parliament since 2001, and so it is with enormous sadness that I have decided not to contest the next General Election in December.""
Earlier today the DUP's David Simpson confirmed he would not stand in Upper Bann where he has held the seat since 2005.
