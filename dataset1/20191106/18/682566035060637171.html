      <p>London - <b>Manchester United </b>boss<b> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b> has targeted qualifying for the knockout stages of the <b>Europa League</b> as a pick-me-up after defeat to Bournemouth ended a brief revival.</p>
      <p>The mood at Old Trafford had been lifted by three successive victories following a draw against Liverpool but the 1-0 loss on the south coast on Saturday was another unsatisfactory Premier League outing.</p>
      <p>United have seven points from three games in Europe this season and victory over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford on Thursday would secure their progress.</p>
      <p>"You're disappointed when you lose a game and of course we were on half a run," Solskjaer said on Wednesday. "But it won't happen in one instance that you turn everything round.</p>
      <p>"It was a quick turnaround, we couldn't get the goal that we felt we deserved early on. But we go again. We've got a great chance now to qualify for the next round, which then means the last two games you can try out a few things."</p>
      <p>United are still without the injured Paul Pogba due to an ankle problem and will be missing defender Victor Lindelof, who played at Bournemouth having been a doubt for the game.</p>
      <p>United, who won the Europa League under former manager Jose Mourinho in 2017, are yet to concede a goal in Group L and winning the competition might be their best route into next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>They are currently languishing in 10th place in the Premier League, 10 points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer said his team were heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p>"There's no shortcuts in football," he said. "It's hard work, sticking together and team spirit. We have to keep working -- we know we're on the right track.</p>
      <p>"Saturday was disappointing but we've got the chance to get two wins before the (international) break.</p>
      <p>"It (Europa League) is one route (to the Champions League), one of two. It has just turned November. You don't talk about the end league table in November."</p>
