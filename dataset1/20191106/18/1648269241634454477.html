      <h1>Science Reveals 5 Ugliest And Prettiest Cars From Last 10 Years</h1>
      <h2>Clearly, somebody broke science.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T18:32:42+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>You may have heard about the Golden Ratio before, though probably not in the automotive realm. Honestly, we're less than impressed by this bit of science right now because we’ve already seen the contents of this slideshow, and frankly, we’re flat-out <i>gobsmacked</i> by this experiment. Before we commit further slander against the scientific community – not to mention the good folks at <i><a href="https://www.carwow.co.uk/best/best-looking-cars">CarWow</a></i> who presumably spent considerable time on this study – let us explain what’s happening here.</p>
      <p>In short, the Golden Ratio is a long-standing equation that basically attempts to quantify beauty. By applying this scientific equation to geometric shapes, the result is allegedly something the human eye finds most pleasing. We say <i>allegedly</i> because, while interesting, beauty is ultimately a subjective exercise. Still, one might use the equation to determine shapes with broad appeal. On that front, the math checks out.</p>
      <p>The <i>CarWow</i> team took the Golden Ratio and applied it to individual shapes on literally hundreds of cars, all to try and determine – from a scientific standpoint – which vehicles are the best and worst looking from the last 10 years. We respect the effort invested into such an endeavor, but we suspect the vast majority of you will agree that, this time around, science is just plain <i>wrong.</i></p>
      <p>The slideshow above features the five ugliest and prettiest cars of recent years as determined by the Golden Ratio, starting with the worst. For the record, you won't find a big-nosed <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/">BMW</a> or a suave <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ferrari/">Ferrari</a> in this collection, which is a bit telling right there. Science can do much better.</p>

      <h3>No. 5 Worst: 2016 Ford Kuga Vignale</h3>
      <p>Science doesn't like <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a>, as this isn't the only Blue Oval singled out in the worst category. It's not our first choice for a beauty pageant, but we can conjure uglier choices than this. Some of them even appear later on ... in the <i>best</i> section.</p>

      <h3>No. 4 Worst: 2015 Audi RS7 Sportback</h3>
      <p>Really science? <i>Really?</i> Not everyone likes <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/">Audi's</a> big grille up front, but the swooping lines of the Sportback are far from ugly.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>No. 3 Worst: 2012 Audi A1 Sportback</h3>
      <p>Science clearly doesn't like Audi either. The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/a1/">A1</a> isn't terrifically exciting, but compared to a first-generation <a href="https://www.motor1.com/nissan/juke/">Nissan Juke</a> – which by the way isn't <i>anywhere</i> on this list – it's a Concours classic. </p>

      <h3>No. 2 Worst: 2019 Mercedes-AMG GLC 63 Coupe</h3>
      <p>It's true that many people have a problem with <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> calling this four-door crossover a <i>coupe</i>, but the Golden Ratio only applies to shapes, not letters. Does it really deserve to be the second ugliest vehicle built in the last 10 years?</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>No. 1 Worst: 2013 Ford Fiesta ST</h3>
      <p>And here comes the hate. There's lots of love around the world for the plucky <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/fiesta/">Fiesta</a>, and while we'll admit it's not the best looking hot hatch of them all, it has a welcome aggressiveness that overshadows its odd proportions. But if this being the worst-looking car upsets you, wait until you see the vehicles science deems the<i> best</i> looking.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>No. 5 Best: 2014 Nissan Micra</h3>
      <p>Actually, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/nissan/micra/">Micra's</a> proportions are rather pleasing. Still, it's not exactly a design that gets the blood pumping at a mere glance, and we'd still rather see the Fiesta here.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/b2kEm/s3/no-4-best-2019-toyota-corolla.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>No. 4 Best: 2019 Toyota Corolla</h3>
      <p>The study singled out the 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/toyota/corolla/">Corolla</a> over other years, and as with the Micra, it's well-proportioned and not<i> unattractive</i>. That sort of thing makes a difference in the mathematical world of the Golden Ratio, but would you rather look at this or a new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/toyota/supra/">Toyota Supra</a>?</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>No. 3 Best: 2016 Vauxhall Mokka</h3>
      <p>And here's where science goes <i>completely</i> off the rails. Whether you call it a Vauxhall Mokka, Opel Mokka, or a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/buick/encore/">Buick Encore</a>, this bubbly compact crossover with its short wheelbase, stubby overhangs, and tall beltline has no business being among the best-looking anything, never mind vehicles.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/VGqMz/s3/no-2-best-2011-volkswagen-up.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>No. 2 Best: 2011 Volkswagen Up!</h3>
      <p>Mathematical proportions strike again with this admittedly cute <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/">VW</a>. There's plenty of symmetry in the design of the earlier Up!, but science doesn't understand that symmetry is only part of what makes something beautiful. It's not the second-best-looking vehicle of the last 10 years despite the placement on this list, but just wait until you see the disaster to come.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/MQov8/s3/no-1-best-2016-smart-fortwo-cabrio.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>No. 1 Best: 2016 Smart ForTwo Cabrio</h3>
      <p>According to the <i>CarWow</i> study, this vehicle scored a 98.83-percent conformity to the Golden Ratio. By the numbers, that means the freaking <a href="https://www.motor1.com/smart/fortwo-cabriolet/">Smart ForTwo Cabrio</a> is the best-looking car built in the last decade. Not a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a>, or an <a href="https://www.motor1.com/aston-martin/vantage/">Aston Martin Vantage</a>, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/corvette/">Corvette</a>, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/alfa-romeo/giulia/">Giulia</a>, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/koenigsegg/agera-rs/">Agera</a>, or any one of <i>hundreds</i> of vehicles that deserve recognition over the roofless Smart. It's not the worst, but it's <i>so</i> far from the best. </p>
