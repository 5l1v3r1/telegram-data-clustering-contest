Katie Gately announces new album ‘Loom,’ shares “Bracer’
06 Nov 2019, 09:06 by Andrew Sacher



Experimental pop artist Katie Gately is finally following her very promising 2016 debut album Color (Tri Angle Records) with a sophomore LP, Loom, due February 14 via Houndstooth (pre-order). The album is dedicated to her mother who passed away in 2018 due to a rare form of cancer, and Katie says she abandoned an “entirely different” album she was working on in the process, and then rebuilt the new album around the ten-minute song “Bracer,” which was her mother’s favorite. That track — which samples “a coffin closing, elephant trumpets, shovels digging, a machine gun, meat smacking, and a cantaloupe being stabbed” — is the album’s first single, and it’s a highly adventurous piece of art pop that takes lots of twists and turns and really earns its lengthy running time. It comes with a visual made by Brian Cantrell. Check it out below.
