蔡英文3字回擊一國兩制：不可能

06 Nov 2019, 09:57

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】中華民國總統蔡英文11月5日在臉書對中共推出的「26條措施」做出強烈回應。她說，中共的用意是企圖強推「一國兩制台灣方案」，台灣政府對此態度很清楚，答案只有3個字：不可能。
中共十九屆四中全會結束後，中共國台辦和國家發改委10月4日推出簡稱「26條措施」的《關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》，並稱，這是落實習近平年初對台講話及四中全會精神，完善促進兩岸交流等制度安排與政策措施。
其中，針對台灣企業、台灣民眾各13條，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」。
然而，中共的「26條措施」遭來台灣各界的強烈反彈。
蔡英文11月5日在其臉書帳號上回應說，中共的用意是企圖強推其「一國兩制台灣方案」，台灣政府對此「態度很清楚，意圖影響大選、逼迫台灣人民接受『一國兩制』，答案只有三個字：不可能。」
蔡英文10月17日接見美國「共和黨國際事務協會」（IRI）訪問團，她致詞時也曾表示，近期香港的民主抗爭，讓台灣人民更加珍惜現有的民主制度與生活方式，將堅定捍衛台灣主權與民主，繼續擁護印太地區的自由、民主和人權價值。
她重申，「一國兩制」永遠不會是台灣人民的選項。

除蔡英文回擊中共對台一國兩制外，包括總統府的其他高層，以及陸委會、行政院、外交部等，均視「26條措施」是北京企圖介入影響台灣大選，強推「一國兩制台灣方案」的做法。
由於條文提到提供台灣民眾與中國民眾同等待遇，包括領事保護、住房、文創賽事、文藝展演、學校招考、體育賽事訓練等，涉及台灣政府的各部門。因此包括文化部、體育部和教育部等也都紛紛做出回應，評估各領域可能受到的影響。
雖然北京推出這個最新的「惠台」措施，但過去3年多來，中國連續對台增強軍事、外交施壓，並使7個國家切斷與台灣的外交關係，台灣民眾認為中國對台灣政府和人民的態度並不友善。
根據陸委會10月底發布的最新民調，54.6%的民眾認為中共政府對台灣人民的態度不友善」，69.4%認為，中共政府對台灣政府的態度不友善。其中支持台灣「終極獨立」，的民眾占27.7%，不贊成「一國兩制」主張的比例高達89.3%。
這一數字比年初習近平提出「一國兩制」台灣方案時高出近14個百分點。

總統府嘲諷中共既虛假又諷刺

總統府發言人丁允恭表示，「26條措施」其實是「一國兩制台灣方案」的行動方案，中共意圖以此框架台灣，也損害台灣人民實質利益。
他說，細究其措施內容，可以發現其所謂惠台的矛盾不實，一邊號稱提供外館協助，一邊卻打壓台灣的外交發展；一邊宣稱歡迎運動員赴陸參賽，另一邊卻在更重要的國際賽事打壓台灣。稱此為惠台，益顯其虛假與諷刺。
丁允恭正告中共，應停止對台灣的打壓、放棄「一國兩制台灣方案」的政治前提，如此方為兩岸發展正道，真正促進和平穩定，也對兩岸人民有真實助益。
民進黨也表示，中共去年祭出「對台31項措施」，但成效不彰，如今於台灣大選前再次放出所謂「26條措施」，企圖拉攏台灣投資。這是中共有計劃性的介入台灣選舉，各界應該提高警覺，這是「中共的司馬昭之心，連國中生都不會上當」。
民進黨還說，即便中共祭出「31條」，但據經濟部投資審議委員會今年統計，2018年台商赴中投資金額較2017年同期減少8.2%；赴中國工作和求學的台灣民眾也在逐年衰退，所謂的「優惠措施」，完全不敵中共嚴重衰退的經濟環境。

06 Nov 2019, 09:57

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] The Chinese President of the Republic of China Tsai Ing-wen responded strongly to the ""26 measures"" launched by the Chinese Communist Party on Facebook on November 5. She said that the CCP's intention is to try to push the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"". The Taiwan government has a very clear attitude. The answer is only three words: impossible.
After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese Communist Party and the National Development and Reform Commission issued a ""Several Measures to Further Promote Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"" referred to as ""26 Measures"" on October 4, and said that this is an internship near Pingping. At the beginning of the year, he made a speech to Taiwan and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, and improved institutional arrangements and policy measures to promote cross-strait exchanges.
Among them, 13 Taiwanese companies and Taiwanese people are advertised as ""providing the same treatment as the Chinese people.""
However, the ""26 measures"" of the CCP have been strongly rebounded from all walks of life in Taiwan.
Tsai Ing-wen responded on his Facebook account on November 5 that the CCP’s intention was to push for its ""one country, two systems Taiwan plan."" The Taiwanese government has a very clear attitude toward this. It intends to influence the general election and force the people of Taiwan to accept ""one country, two systems"". The answer is only three words: impossible.""
Tsai Ing-wen met with the US Republican International Affairs Association (IRI) delegation on October 17. She also said that the recent democratic struggle in Hong Kong has made the people of Taiwan cherish the existing democratic system and way of life and will firmly defend it. Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy continue to support the values of freedom, democracy and human rights in the Indo-Pacific region.
She reiterated that ""one country, two systems"" will never be an option for the people of Taiwan.

In addition to Tsai Ing-wen’s response to the CCP’s one-two-two system, including other high-level presidential palaces, as well as the MAC, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all of them regard the “26 measures” as Beijing’s attempt to intervene in the Taiwan election and push the “one country, two systems Taiwan plan”. ""way of doing.
The article mentions that Taiwanese people are treated the same as the Chinese people, including consular protection, housing, cultural and creative events, cultural performances, school recruitment, sports training, etc., involving various departments of the Taiwan government. Therefore, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Sports and the Ministry of Education have also responded to assess the possible impacts in various fields.
Although Beijing has launched this latest ""Huaitai"" measure, over the past three years, China has continuously increased military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan and has cut off diplomatic relations with Taiwan from seven countries. The Taiwanese people believe that China is against the Taiwan government. And the attitude of the people is not friendly.

The presidential palace ridicules the CCP’s both false and ironic

The presidential palace spokesman Ding Yungong said that the ""26 measures"" are actually the action plan of the ""one country, two systems Taiwan plan"". The CCP intends to use this framework to frame Taiwan and also harm the Taiwan people's substantive interests.
He said that if you study the contents of the measures, you can find that the so-called Huitai contradiction is not true. On the one hand, it claims to provide assistance from the foreign pavilion, while suppressing Taiwan's diplomatic development; while claiming to welcome athletes to participate in the competition, the other is more important international. The event suppressed Taiwan. Calling this Huitai, it shows its falsehood and irony.
Ding Yungong told the CCP that the political premise of suppressing Taiwan and abandoning the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"" should be stopped. This will lead to the development of the right path for the two sides of the strait, truly promote peace and stability, and also have real benefits for the people on both sides of the strait.
The Democratic Progressive Party also said that the Chinese Communist Party offered ""31 measures against Taiwan"" last year, but the results were not good. Now, before the Taiwan election, the so-called ""26 measures"" will be released again in an attempt to attract Taiwan investment. This is the planned participation of the CCP in the Taiwan elections. All walks of life should be vigilant. This is ""the heart of the CCP's Sima Zhao, and even the Chinese students will not be fooled.""
The DPP also said that even if the CCP sacrificed ""31"", according to the statistics of the Investment Review Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs this year, the amount of Taiwanese investment in China in 2018 decreased by 8.2% compared with the same period in 2017; the Taiwanese who went to work and study in China also In the year-on-year recession, the so-called ""preferential measures"" are completely invincible to the economic environment in which the CCP is seriously declining.
