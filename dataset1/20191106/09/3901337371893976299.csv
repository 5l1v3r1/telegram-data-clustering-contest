The Swiss midfielder erupted in the 61st minute of his side's recent 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace after being booed by fans upon his substitution.
As he made his way off the pitch to loud jeers from his own team's supporters, he reacted by throwing his hands up in the air and swearing at the crowd before angrily removing his shirt and making his way straight down the tunnel.
Xhaka, who has since apologized and explained that death threats towards his family were the reason for his reaction, was dropped from Arsenal's next two matchday squads, and has now been stripped of his captaincy, manager Emery confirmed this week.
