Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Lebese is a man on a mission and has intensified his efforts in search of a club. Check it out!
Lebese, who was on the books of defending PSL Champions, Mamelodi Sundowns as well as a loan stint with SuperSport United, has taken to Instagram to show just how serious he is about returning to the pitch.
The 30-year-old has been clubless since departing from Downs at the end of last season and is a free agent, who can join any interested team locally or abroad.

 Lebese has hit the gym and hard! The left footed dribbling wizard enlisted the services of personal trainer, Tebogo Mashalane as he looks to get into the best shape possible.
Fans will remember that his former coach Pitso Mosimane highlighted the fact that Lebese carried some extra weight when he joined the team from Kaizer Chiefs a few seasons ago.
A much slimmer Lebese shared some highlights of his workout on his Instagram page.



“Comeback season! @pumasouthafrica@tebogo_mashalane_88@vivid_contemporary,” he wrote.

Which team do you think Lebese would be better off signing for?
