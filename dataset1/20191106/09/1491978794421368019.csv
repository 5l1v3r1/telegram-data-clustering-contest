Photographs of Keith Flint on display at Cheffins auctioneers in Cambridge



Flint’s MTV music awards



Flint’s shoes. More than 170 lots will be offered reflecting his taste in art and fashion and his interests



Some of his jewellery. The sale will feature much of Flint’s personal clothing and jewellery, including body jewellery. It will include a distinctive double cone septum piercing that he was regularly seen wearing on and off stage



Flint’s furniture. The furniture and artworks from his home are a mixture of traditional craftmanship and contemporary, urban style



Flint’s furniture and items of clothing. His wardrobe demonstrates his love of Japanese clothing brand Bathing Ape, with a number of hoodies, T-shirts, shirts and more, many in its signature camouflage designs



Photographs of Flint. His art collection includes a portrait by artist Kirk Andrews of him surrounded by dedications, which was commissioned by fans and presented to him on his 47th birthday at his pub, the Leather Bottle in Pleshey, Essex



Flint’s gold and platinum selling albums alongside a stuffed hare



Flint’s custom-made oak and steel bed. Perhaps the most striking piece is this bed, which the musician had a hand in designing. The oak plank and steel construction is supported at each corner by entwined thorn sculptures and is accessed via steps supported on the back of a crouching winged mythical beast



The distinctive double cone septum jewellery



Flint’s gold and platinum albums



Flint’s jeans



Flint’s car registration plates reflect his interest in motorsports. Also included are images of Barry Sheen and a Le Mans Porsche. His keen interest in motor racing extended to his ownership of a motorcycle team, Team Traction Control, which competed in the British Supersport Championship as part of the British Superbike Championship. In 2015 Team Traction Control machines also won two Isle of Man TT races



Flint’s furniture and pieces of clothing



Flint’s mixing decks and more clothing. The sale will include some of his motorcycle leathers and helmets
