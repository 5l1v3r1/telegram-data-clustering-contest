      <p>LONDON, Nov 6 — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election campaign launch got off to a poor start today, when his party chairman was forced to defend distributing a doctored video clip of a rival Labour Party politician.</p>
      <p>As Britain heads towards a Dec. 12 election that could shape the fate of Brexit, some politicians have expressed concerns that misleading information – known as “fake news” – could spread swiftly across social media.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s Conservatives distributed a doctored video clip of Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, editing out a key response in an interview to give the impression that the party had no answer for Brexit.</p>
      <p>Starmer was grilled by ITV on Tuesday over the party’s Brexit plans, including rigorous questioning on its policy of trying to negotiate a new divorce deal and then holding a referendum in which its lawmakers might then campaign against the agreement they had struck.</p>
      <p>In a heavily edited video of the interview published by the Conservatives, Starmer was shown being asked by ITV presenter Piers Morgan why the EU would give a Labour government a good Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Starmer was shown apparently blinking, startled, faltering and uncomfortable behind the red slogan: “Labour has no plan for Brexit.”</p>
      <p>Yet in the actual interview, Starmer did not falter but answered immediately: “Well Piers, I have been talking to the EU, to political leaders across the EU 27 countries for three years and I know very well what the parameters are of any deal that they would do with a Labour government.”</p>
      <p>Conservative lawmaker Johnny Mercer said the video he had tweeted had been doctored and apologised.</p>
      <p>“It would appear this has inexplicably been doctored at the end. I apologise and will remove it. The original interview was bad enough – I have no idea why this needed altering,” Mercer said.</p>
      <p>Yet Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly, speaking to ITV on Wednesday, repeatedly refused to either accept that the clip had been doctored or to apologise.</p>
      <p>“The reason we clipped the video was to make it shorter because Keir’s answers rambled on,” Cleverly said.</p>
      <p>ITV journalist Morgan, an admirer of late Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said the Conservatives had doctored the clip.</p>
      <p>“I just find that absolutely staggering: to shamelessly re-edit a video to make it look like something completely different, give a completely misleading and different version to what actually happened to make your opponents look stupid,” Morgan said.</p>
      <p>“And when you are caught – you just don’t have the good grace to say: ‘Yeah, we shouldn’t have done that – I’m sorry’.” — Reuters</p>
