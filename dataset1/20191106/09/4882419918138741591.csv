About to complete its first month since its worldwide premiere and extended until Jan. 4, the Messi10 by Cirque du Soleil show has quickly become one of Barcelona's finest cultural offerings. Without a doubt, the fact that it's a show which breaks molds has been key to its success with the public.
No one leaves their seat without being support, given it's a football match made into art. The perfect mix of Messi and Cirque du Soleil, with art and football combining to please everyone who watches. The audience has enjoyed an innovative spectacle, regardless of it they are fans of the Barcelona captain or not.
The atmosphere in Parc del Forum, where the show is, is family-orientated with a hint of football, given Messi is known across the planet, to the point that many tourists in Catalonia have been to see the show.
People even take their time to do the Messi Challenge, one of the other elements that people can enjoy before the show. The experience is proving a success and has taken its seat among the many things to do and see in Barcelona, be that musicals, theatre shows or concerts. Messi 10 by Cirque du Soleil has found its place.
