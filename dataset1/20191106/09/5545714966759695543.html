      <p>Roll call for amiibo!</p>
      <p>Although these wretched toys are slowing down considerably in terms of buzz and sales, there's still a lot of amiibo coming on the horizon. Long term we still need pretty much every DLC character, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../are-you-finishing-the-smash-amiibo-line-or-did-you-give-up-like-a-sensible-person--568304.phtml">there's some holes to fill in the <i>Smash </i>roster</a>, thanks to <i>Smash Ultimate</i>.</p>
      <p>In the short term, there's still a bunch of figures on the horizon. On November 15 of this year, Simon Belmont, Chrom and Incineroar will launch. Whenever <i>Shovel Knight: King of Cards</i> hits (this has been a big question mark for a few years now) it will come with a three-pack of King Knight, Plague Knight and Specter Knight to correspond with the appropriate DLC packs, as well as a Gold Shovel Knight figure for good measure.</p>
      <p>Now we know what's coming after <i>that</i> thanks to a new tweet from Nintendo: Dark Samus and Richter Belmont, in what I've dubbed as "<i>Smash Ultimate </i>Wave 7," will launch on January 17, 2020. Consider this a warning shot. These amiibo will likely be up for pre-order very soon, and no one knows if they're going to be rare.</p>
      <p>As always, here is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../here-are-all-the-amiibo-waves-and-figures-we-know-about-284136.phtml">a full and comprehensive list of every amiibo figure ever made</a>.</p>
