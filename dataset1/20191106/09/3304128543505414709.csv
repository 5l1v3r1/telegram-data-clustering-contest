Drama ensued at the High Court of Eldoret after a suspect in a murder case was attacked by the victim’s mother.
Beatrice Wanyota, the mother to slain Vera Beauty college student Emma Wanyota aged 26, went berserk in court claiming that the case involving her daughter was being delayed.
She pounced on the suspect, Mustafa Idd aged 31 and caught the police and lawyers unaware, slapping and punching him while wailing that he was her daughter’s killer.
“You are the one who killed my daughter and I am so angry with you. Whenever I come to court for my daughter’s case, the matter is always postponed ostensibly to pave the way for mental assessment of the accused,” said the frustrated mother.
