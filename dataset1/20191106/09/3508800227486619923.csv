超過106萬噸的福島核汙水恐「排入海洋」，綠色和平警告將「更快」影響台灣
06 Nov 2019, 09:51 by Abby Huang


我們想讓你知道的是福島核災至今雖然已經近9年，但專家警告人類仍然還在「危機初期」，仍有包括無處可去的核汙水等危機待解決。



長期關注全球核能安全、綠色和平組織核專家蕭恩．伯尼（Shaun Burnie）經過23年再度來台。
上次來台是為蘭嶼核廢料議題發聲，今（6）日則針對最新研究提出警告，福島核災後地下水持續進入福島核電廠，不僅造成核輻射汙水，可能已經比原先預估更快的速度，抵達台灣海域。
8年前的東日本發生311大地震，隨之而來的大海嘯摧毀了驅動冷卻系統的柴油發電系統，導致反應爐過熱發生爐心熔毀。東京電力公司為了冷卻反應爐，持續向爐內注入大量冷卻水，造成大量受到輻射污染的核汙水。而流經第一核電廠的地下水也持續受到汙染，如何處置這些帶有放射性物質的污染廢水，也成為日本與鄰近國家的棘手難題。
106萬噸的核汙水無處可去，新報告揭示「更快」影響台灣
為了冷卻爐心，自2011年311福島事故8年後，日本東京電力直到今日還是每天向已經熔毀的反應爐注入200-216噸的冷卻水。截至今（2019）年10月22日，總共累積了106萬8630噸的汙水無處可排放。東京電力本月又建置4個新的儲存槽來存放這些汙水，不過根據東電，2022年夏天儲存量將會爆滿。
這麼多的廢水該如何處置？日本環境大臣原田義昭今年9月被問及核汙水的處理議題，表示「除了直接排放（入海）稀釋外，別無他法」，由於這些核廢水雖然經處理，仍然含有很難去除的氚等輻射物質，隨即引發當地漁民抗議，鄰近的國家也表示憂慮。
伯尼今日也批評，有擴建儲存槽、原地保存這樣相對安全的選擇，日本政府與相關部門目前仍傾向將廢水排放至海洋，只是為了減少成本。
根據日本政府估計，福島核災帶來的影響為21兆日圓，日本財經研究院的估計則是81兆日圓，當中很大的部分都是花在核汙水的處理上。不過這些汙水若排入水中，將不只衝擊日本東北各省的沿岸與漁業，也會影響鄰近的國家。
根據2018年11月發表的海洋模擬數據推估，2011年從福島隨著核汙水被排入大海的「銫137」，循海流將會在2013年抵達台灣北方海域，並在2014-2018年達到高峰（1.3-1.8拍貝克PBq／立方公尺），比原能會早前預期影響台灣的速度更快，衝擊了原先認為福島核汙水不會影響中國東海的說法。

核汙水可能對人體的危害有哪些？
伯尼指出，雖然這樣的濃度不會立即危及生命，無須誇大汙染物帶來的危害，但依照國際輻射標準，「沒有所謂的安全值」。
銫最大的危害是對陸地的汙染，將提升背景環境的輻射，會穿透皮膚表層。銫137的半衰期為30年，需要經過300年的時間才能保證對人體無害。且因為銫的分子非常小，吸入到肺中仍然對健康有影響，也影響水中生物，透過食物鏈的累積將汙染物吃進人類身體裡。
另外，目前儲存在福島第一核電廠超過百萬噸的核汙水，雖然經過處理，仍無法透過「ALPS多核種除去設備」去除放射性核種「氚（H-3）」。伯尼也指出，即便日本政府聲稱氚（H-3）對於環境健康沒有危害，伯尼指出，氚（H-3）能進入細胞結構當中有機結合，可能影響生物DNA，另外也會聚集在貝類上，衝擊漁業。雖然日本政府預估將花30年的時間解決福島第一核電廠，不過伯尼指出，氚（H-3）至少需要花125年的時間才能達安全值。


福島第一核電廠的「汙染水」變「處理水」後，到底能不能排到大海？


事故發生近9年，福島核災仍處於「危機初期」
福島核災至今雖然已經近9年，但伯尼警告，全人類仍然還在「危機初期」，仍有很多問題尚待解決。
為阻止地下水滲入第一核電廠反應堆、受到汙染並流入附近的太平洋，日本政府修建冰牆，想以人工凍土圍牆將反應堆封起來，但伯尼指出，地下水仍不斷流經第一核電廠地底，如2017年蘭恩颱風衝擊日本，每日地下水量超過800公噸，而今年影響更劇的哈吉斯颱風影響為何，目前還未知。
伯尼指出，日本政府日後若將核汙水排入海洋，應先對環境與經濟產生的影響做出解釋，這也不是日本國內問題，而是跨越國界，是日本政府必須與全世界在未來共同面對，且不是短期能解決的。他也表示，台灣有很多方式可以進入可再生能源的領域，台灣關於核能的討論，都跟日本一樣「分神」，不去聚焦在真正重要的東西上。
長期關注國內核議題的綠色公民行動聯盟秘書長崔愫欣則表示，從福島核災到車諾比的教訓，也讓台灣學到能源轉型，「日本人沒得選擇，我們還有選擇」。
今年10月，韓國代表在《倫敦傾倒公約議定書》會議上，再次向日本表達對福島汙水處理的關注。韓國代表指出，如果（日方）真的將受汙染的水從工廠排到海洋，可能會對全球海洋環境產生影響，並且違反《倫敦議定書》的目標，希望日本政府「需要在處理核電廠汙水上保持透明，並且與鄰國和國際社會衝分溝通討論其處理方法。」日本代表則回應，日本政府內部尚未就如何處理核電廠汙水作出任何決定。

More than 1.06 million tons of Fukushima nuclear sewage will be ""discharged into the ocean"", Greenpeace warning will ""faster"" affect Taiwan
06 Nov 2019, 09:51 by Abby Huang


What we want you to know is that although the Fukushima nuclear disaster has been in existence for nearly nine years, experts warn that human beings are still in the early stages of the crisis, and there are still crises such as nuclear sewage that have nowhere to go.



Long-term attention to global nuclear energy security, Greenpeace nuclear expert Xiao En. Shaun Burnie came back to Taiwan after 23 years.
The last time I came to Taiwan was to voice the issue of nuclear waste on Lanyu. Today (6), I warned against the latest research. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, groundwater continued to enter the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which not only caused nuclear radiation, but may have been faster than originally estimated. The speed of arrival in the waters of Taiwan.
Eight years ago, the 311 earthquake occurred in East Japan, and the tsunami that followed it destroyed the diesel power generation system that drives the cooling system, causing the reactor to overheat and melt. In order to cool the reactor, the Tokyo Electric Power Company continued to inject a large amount of cooling water into the furnace, causing a large amount of nuclear sewage contaminated by radiation. The groundwater flowing through the first nuclear power plant is also continuously polluted. How to dispose of these polluted wastewater with radioactive materials has become a difficult problem for Japan and neighboring countries.
1.06 million tons of nuclear sewage has nowhere to go, the new report reveals that ""faster"" affects Taiwan
In order to cool the hearth, since the 311 Fukushima accident in 2011, Tokyo Electric Power of Japan has injected 200-216 tons of cooling water into the melted reactor every day. On October 22, 2019, a total of 1.086 million tons of sewage was accumulated and nowhere to be discharged. Tokyo Electric Power has built four new storage tanks to store the sewage this month, but according to Dongdian, the stock will be full in the summer of 2022.
How to deal with so much wastewater? Japan’s Minister of the Environment, Harada Yoshida, was asked in September this year about the treatment of nuclear sewage, saying that “there is no alternative to direct discharge (into the sea) dilution,” because these nuclear wastewaters, although treated, still contain cesium that is difficult to remove. The radiation of the material immediately triggered protests from local fishermen, and neighboring countries expressed concern.
Bernie also today criticized the relatively safe choice of expanding storage tanks and in situ conservation. The Japanese government and related departments still tend to discharge wastewater to the ocean just to reduce costs.
According to estimates by the Japanese government, the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster is 21 trillion yen, and the Japan Finance and Economics Institute estimates 81 trillion yen, a large part of which is spent on nuclear sewage treatment. However, if these sewages are discharged into the water, they will not only affect the coastal areas and fisheries in the northeastern provinces of Japan, but also affect neighboring countries.
According to the ocean simulation data published in November 2018, in 2011, the 铯137, which was discharged from the Fukushima with the nuclear sewage into the sea, will arrive in the northern waters of Taiwan in 2013, and in 2014-2018. The peak (1.3-1.8 Baker PBq/m3) is faster than the original expected to affect Taiwan earlier, which shocked the original belief that Fukushima nuclear sewage would not affect China's East China Sea.

What are the hazards of nuclear sewage to the human body?
Bernie pointed out that although such concentrations are not immediately life-threatening, there is no need to exaggerate the harm caused by pollutants, but according to international radiation standards, ""there is no such thing as a safe value.""
The biggest hazard is the pollution of the land, which will increase the radiation in the background environment and penetrate the surface of the skin. The half-life of 铯137 is 30 years, and it takes 300 years to ensure that it is harmless to the human body. And because the molecules of cockroaches are very small, inhalation into the lungs still has an impact on health, as well as on aquatic organisms, and the pollutants are eaten into the human body through the accumulation of food chains.
In addition, more than one million tons of nuclear sewage currently stored in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has not been removed from the radioactive nuclear species ""H3"" through the ""ALPS multi-nuclear removal equipment"". Bernie also pointed out that even if the Japanese government claimed that 氚(H-3) is not harmful to environmental health, Bernie pointed out that 氚(H-3) can enter the cell structure and organically bind, which may affect biological DNA, and also aggregate in shellfish. On, impact fisheries. Although the Japanese government estimates that it will take 30 years to resolve the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Bernie pointed out that it takes at least 125 years for the H3 to reach a safe value.


After the ""pollution water"" of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant changed to ""treatment of water"", could it be discharged to the sea?


Nearly nine years after the accident, the Fukushima nuclear disaster is still in the early stages of the crisis.
Although the Fukushima nuclear disaster has been nearly nine years old, Bernie warned that all mankind is still in the early stages of the crisis, and many problems remain to be resolved.
In order to prevent groundwater from penetrating into the reactor of the first nuclear power plant, being polluted and flowing into the nearby Pacific Ocean, the Japanese government built an ice wall and wanted to seal the reactor with artificial frozen soil walls, but Bernie pointed out that groundwater continued to flow through the ground of the first nuclear power plant. For example, in 2017, the typhoon of Lann hit Japan, the daily groundwater volume exceeded 800 metric tons, and the impact of the typhoon Haggis that affected this year is still unknown.
Bernie pointed out that if the Japanese government releases nuclear sewage into the ocean in the future, it should first explain the impact on the environment and the economy. This is not a domestic problem in Japan, but a transnational border. It is the Japanese government must and the world in the future. Face together, and not a short-term solution. He also said that there are many ways for Taiwan to enter the field of renewable energy. Taiwan's discussion on nuclear energy is as distracting as Japan, and it is not focused on what is really important.
Cui Yuxin, secretary-general of the Green Citizen Action Coalition, which has long been concerned about domestic nuclear issues, said that the lessons from the Fukushima nuclear disaster to the Cherokee have also allowed Taiwan to learn about energy transformation. ""The Japanese have no choice but to have a choice.""
In October this year, the South Korean representative once again expressed concern about the sewage treatment in Fukushima to Japan at the meeting of the Protocol on the Dumping of London Convention. The representative of South Korea pointed out that if Japan (Japan) really discharges polluted water from the factory to the sea, it may have an impact on the global marine environment and violate the objectives of the London Protocol. It is hoped that the Japanese government will ""need to deal with nuclear power plant pollution."" The water is transparent and communicates with neighboring countries and the international community to discuss its treatment.” The representative of Japan responded that the Japanese government has not made any decision on how to treat the sewage from nuclear power plants.
