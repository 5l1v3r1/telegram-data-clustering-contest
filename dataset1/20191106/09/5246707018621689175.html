      <p>No matter how famous people become, it's always nice to see how they can still become normal, grounded people when the time is right – like when you're approached by the president of one of your favourite games companies and asked which character you prefer in <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a></b>. (That kind of thing happens all the time to us mere mortals, right?)</p>
      <p>This story begins when Brie Larson – she of <b>Captain Marvel</b> and <b>Room</b> fame – responded to a Nintendo of America tweet about Luigi's latest adventure on Switch.</p>

      <p>Things escalated from there, as Doug Bowser (yes, it is he) locked onto the reply and asked Larson that important question:</p>

      <p>Larson – who has also starred in <b>Kong: Skull Island</b>, <b>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</b> and <b>21 Jump Street</b> and has an Academy Award and Golden Globe to her name – was clearly a little overawed by the encounter, which proves no matter how famous and acclaimed you become, there's still a small part of everyone which is <i>instantly</i> humbled when Nintendo comes knocking.</p>
