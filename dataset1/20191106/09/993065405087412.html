      <p>Martin Millard, director at Cheffins Fine Art auctioneers, said: “There has been a great deal of interest from all around the world in the Keith Flint Collection since the sale was announced, and the viewing days we have had so far have been busy.</p>
      <p>“Fans of Keith who have seen the collection have been overwhelmingly positive about the way it has been presented and many have expressed an interest in buying some of the lots on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“We are expecting the saleroom to be busy but, beyond that, it is almost impossible to predict how much any of the items are going to make.”</p>
