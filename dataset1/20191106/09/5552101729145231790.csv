中國國台辦日前對台推出《26條措施》，加上央視主播海霞也在節目中喊話「台灣的命運與祖國相連，灣灣回家吧。」引起許多台灣網友熱議與質疑。無黨籍立委洪慈庸po文反擊，強調「這種包裹糖衣的陷阱，與一國兩制的謊言，台灣人早已看得清清楚楚。」她更狠狠打臉央視主播，「不用喊『灣灣回家吧』，我們台灣人已經在自己家。」
針對國台辦先前推出惠台《26條措施》，行政院長蘇貞昌昨（5）日於臉書po文，要大家用台語唸看看「26條」，就會發現這些惠台措施其實是「打壓（2）、掐牢（6）」，更強調台灣不用祈求施捨、也不必看人臉色，「自己的國家，終究還是要有自己的空間、自己努力比較好。」
民進黨立院黨團今（6）日也召開記者會，提醒民眾「路邊紅包不要撿，中國對台26條＝打壓、掐牢」。其中出席立委趙天麟、周春米、黃國書、黃秀芳、鄭寶清、賴瑞隆、陳曼麗、李俊俋、管碧玲及王定宇等人，也一起示範蘇貞昌所發現「打壓、掐牢」的手勢，更強調《26條措施》是包藏禍心、禍台惠中方案。








此外，無黨籍立委洪慈庸今（6）日也於臉書po文，痛批中共再次推出惠台26措施，就是要拿經濟利多企圖籠騙台灣人，上鉤後就難以脫離中共的擺布。「但這種包裹糖衣的陷阱，與一國兩制的謊言，台灣人早已看得清清楚楚。」
洪慈庸也強調表示，我們台灣人有引以為傲的民主自由，人民也有力量去影響國家政策，是許多國家羨慕的生活方式，也是台灣人將捍衛的生活方式。最後，洪慈庸更打臉央視主播海霞，「不用喊『灣灣回家吧』，我們台灣人已經在自己家。」
