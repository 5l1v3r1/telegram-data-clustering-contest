“We are pleased to join this partnership, which seeks to restore the dignity of forcibly displaced people – who are among the most vulnerable populations in the world. Safaricom believes that no matter the circumstances, no one should be left behind. We are excited to join a partnership that is bridging this gap by addressing challenges faced by the refugees,” said Michael Joseph.
The Tent Partnership for Refugees mobilizes the business community to improve the lives and livelihoods of over 25 million refugees who have been forcibly displaced from their home countries.

Safaricom previous work with Vodafone, UNHCR, and Huawei was to help bring technology to classrooms in refugee camps through the Instant Network School program.
The Telecommunication Company is exploring the use of direct cash transfer and plans to offer services such as e-voucher product that allows refugees to purchase food and other key items, while also helping to grow the local economy.
Gideon Maltz, Executive Director at the Tent Partnership for Refugees, said, “We’re thrilled that Safaricom has joined Tent. Safaricom is already offering a range of products and services for refugees in Kenya – joining Tent will mean building on this great work.”
Tent encourages Companies to make commitments to help refugees as well as shares best practice of companies’ experiences to support the economic integration of refugees.
