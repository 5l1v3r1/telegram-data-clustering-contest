      <h1>Watch The Hold Steady Play “Meet Me In The Lobby,” Their Theme For Seth Meyers’ New Netflix Comedy Special</h1>

      <p>Seth Meyers has always been a huge fan and supporter of the Hold Steady. It’s one of the coolest things about him. Meyers has booked the Hold Steady as musical guests on <i>Late Night With Seth Meyers</i> a bunch of times over the years — most recently <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057877/hold-steady-seth-meyers/video/">in September</a>, shortly after they released the new album <i>Thrashing Thru The Passion</i>. He’s even booked multiple Craig Finn solo performances. And now he’s gotten the Hold Steady to write the theme song to his Netflix special.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Netflix shared Meyers’ new stand-up special <i>Lobby Baby</i> — so titled, as Meyers explains, because his son was born in an apartment building lobby. And last night, Meyers once again introduced the Hold Steady as <i>Late Night</i> musical guests, calling them his “favorite band” and explaining that they’d be performing “Meet Me In The Lobby,” a song that they’d written specifically for the Netflix special. (It’s probably safe to assume that the title is a reference to both the Strokes song “Meet Me In The Lobby” and the Lizzy Goodman book <i>Meet Me In The Bathroom</i>.)</p>
      <p>“Meet Me In The Lobby,” which the Hold Steady have not released and which I don’t think they’d played live before yesterday, is a classic Hold Steady rager. It’s got triumphant guitar riffage, soaring backup vocals, a lovely little piano breakdown, and plenty of room for Craig Finn gesticulations. And while I can never tell this sort of thing without a lyric sheet in front of me, I think it might be written from the perspective of the baby? Watch the performance, as well as a trailer for <i>Lobby Baby</i>, below.</p>

      <p><i>Lobby Baby</i> is streaming now on Netflix, and you can watch it <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81058497?trackId=13752289&amp;tctx=0%2C0%2Cf31d85343fc6115662552bd46d68660855a32f50%3A56b319edd9718d94b2d7eaa074efa3ed8158a51b%2C%2C">here</a>. The self-released <i>Thrashing Thru The Passion</i> is also out now, and you can stream it <a href="https://holdsteady.bandcamp.com/">here</a>. Can Craig Finn get his own Netflix special now? He would crush that.</p>
