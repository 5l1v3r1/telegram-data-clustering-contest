【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】台灣名模林志玲6月初閃電宣布嫁給日本放浪兄弟男星AKIRA，引爆輿論關注。據台媒報導，林志玲與AKIRA已祕密籌備11月17日在台南舉行婚禮。
據《鏡週刊》報導，林志玲與AKIRA定於11月17日在台南後壁舉行婚禮，之所以選在這裡是因為後壁是林志玲爸爸的家鄉，孝順的林志玲於是將婚禮地點選在這裡。
據悉，林志玲和AKIRA對於舉辦婚事相當保密，雖然兩人都人緣極佳、交友廣闊，但婚禮僅邀請少數至親好友。
有媒體收到爆料稱收到林志玲的婚禮請柬，請柬內容如下：「來自我們的小邀請~因為您對我們而言是非常重要的人，所以請您來接受我們愛的抱抱。讓幸福無限延伸~2019年11月17日❤在台南喔❤預計下午就會開始小小的儀式派對，We will be honored with your presence。（我們很榮幸您的光臨）。」最後寫著良平Akira和志玲敬邀。
還有媒體致電林志玲哥哥林志鴻，他雖然回應說，「我不方便說多說什麼」。但看得出來他的心情很好。
目前，林志玲邀請賓客下榻的飯店及婚宴地點仍未對外公布。對此，林志玲的經紀人尚未有回應。
上個月，林志玲先生AKIRA為主演短片《燦爛星空下》出席高雄電影節記者會，首度以「台灣女婿」身份在臺露面。
他感性說：「現在結婚了，台灣是第二個家，不再是出國，是『回來』的感覺。」
談到兩人婚事，他當時也透露：「結婚是一輩子只有一次的事情，會希望用拍照也好、影片也好，把美好的事記錄留下來，如果有機會，一定會跟大家分享。」
44歲的林志玲於6月6日突然宣布在台灣登記結婚，新郎是小她7歲的日本樂團「放浪兄弟」成員Akira，震撼娛樂圈。
林志玲隨後對台灣蘋果新聞網透露：「我們認識是7年前，最近重新聯繫上，我覺得現在是真正的時間步入家庭。」
原來林志玲和Akira7年前因合演舞台劇《赤壁─愛》結緣，近期重逢，去年底來電，交往半年閃電結婚。
對於閃婚，林志玲說：「這是最對的時候。」男方則回應：「打從心底要讓志玲幸福。」
