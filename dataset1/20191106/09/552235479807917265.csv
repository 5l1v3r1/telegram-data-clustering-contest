Celtic have signed Callum McGregor on a new five-year contract.
The stylish midfielder is the latest player in Neil Lennon’s squad to be tied down on a long deal following Scott Bain and James Forrest.
It’s a one-year extension for McGregor who was previously under contract until 2023. He will now remain with the champions until 2024.
The 26-year-old has been a massive part of Celtic’s incredible treble Treble haul. He has made 290 appearances in the Hoops, scoring 55 times.
McGregor’s trophy haul reads: five league titles, three Scottish Cups and three Betfred Cups.
Last season’s player of the year will be one of Lennon’s first names on his teamsheet for Thursday night’s Europa League showdown with Lazio.
Last week Bain and Forrest signed new deals while the manager also strongly hinted at fresh terms for skipper Scott Brown.
McGregor is also seen as a successor to Brown’s captaincy.
A club statement read: ""Celtic are delighted to announce that Callum McGregor has signed a new five-year contract that will see him remain at the club until at least the summer of 2024.""
