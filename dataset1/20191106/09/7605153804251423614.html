      <h1>FIFA asks Iraq to host qualifiers elsewhere</h1>

        <b>BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov 6 – Iraq has been told to find neutral venues for this month’s home qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup and 2023 Asia Cup because of ongoing protests, officials said on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Iraq had been due to play the two games in Basra — against Iran on November 14 and Bahrain on November 19 — but the southern port city has been caught up in the anti-government demonstrations that have swept Baghdad and the south.</p>
      <p>“FIFA informed us late Tuesday night that we must choose a new place, an alternative outside Iraq, for the scheduled match with Iran by Wednesday,” the deputy head of the Iraqi football federation, Ali Jabbar, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The Iraqi federation has received a formal letter from FIFA and is “following up on the issue,” another member of the federation confirmed.</p>
      <p>A statement from FIFA said it had assessed “the current security situation in Iraq” and informed the local federation that upcoming matches “must be played on neutral ground.”</p>
      <p>“The Iraqi Football Association has been requested to nominate a neutral venue for the said matches, which is subject to confirmation by FIFA and the AFC,” it said.</p>
      <p>The decision is a major disappointment for Iraq, which had lobbied FIFA for years to reverse a ban on hosting home internationals because of instability.</p>
      <p>Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the country was plunged into years of violence and no international games were hosted there.</p>
      <p>The ban was lifted by FIFA last year and Iraq hosted its first qualifier in October against Hong Kong, winning 2-0.</p>
      <p>Iraq tops its group for Asia Cup qualification with seven points, leading  Bahrain on goal difference, while Iran holds third spot with six points.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong and Cambodia each have one point.</p>
