      <p>Police and firefighters were pelted with fireworks and rival groups fired rockets at each other as Bonfire Night celebrations descended into chaos.</p>
      <p>Shocking scenes across Britain saw fireworks used as weapons in violent clashes.</p>
      <p>Several arrests were made in Leeds, where yobs attacked police by firing missiles.</p>
      <p>And an Asda car park in Manchester resembled a "war zone" as shoppers fled for their lives in as thugs launched fireworks at cars.</p>
      <p>In Wrexham, emergency services were also targeted, with police chiefs warning that lives were being put at risk.</p>
      <p>And two men were arrested in Edinburgh on suspicion of supplying fireworks to youths after missiles were aimed at police.</p>

      <p>West Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Damien Miller said: “We made it clear from the outset that any instances of disorder or antisocial behaviour would not be tolerated and we were able to quickly respond.</p>
      <p>“Those individuals that engage in such behaviour are within the minority and do not represent the wider community.”</p>
      <p>Describing the chaos in Manchester, a witness told the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/shoppers-flee-lives-gangs-yobs-17207223">Manchester Evening News</a> : "I felt like I was in a warzone.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was fleeing for their lives whilst trying to shop.</p>
      <p>"A group of 20 were shooting fireworks at each other, including rockets."</p>

      <p>The same evening Greater Manchester Fire &amp; Rescue Service tweeted: "We thought the bin fires were disappointing but now our crews are being attacked</p>
      <p>"There's a group of around 20 young people launching fireworks at our firefighters who are working hard to keep you safe</p>
      <p>"Attacks like these are completely unacceptable #BonfireNight"</p>
      <p>North Wales Police said groups of yobs had launched fireworks at emergency service workers in Wrexham, <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/mindless-yobs-throw-rockets-firefighters-17207340">North Wales Live reports</a> .</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: A spokesman said: "We have received reports that youths in  <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/all-about/wrexham">Wrexham</a>  are throwing fireworks at our colleagues from  <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/all-about/north-wales-fire-and-rescue-service">North Wales Fire and Rescue Service</a> .</p>
      <p>"Please do not endanger lives with such mindless acts.</p>
      <p>"Our officers will deal robustly with anyone seen acting in this way."</p>
      <p>Following a similar incident in Edinburgh, police posted pictures of rockets on Twitter, writing: "As part of Operation Moonbeam &amp; proactive policing in Edinburgh this evening &amp; following an incident involving fireworks being aimed at police, two men have been arrested for providing fireworks to youths.</p>
      <p>"Their van was seized &amp; they will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal."</p>
      <p>In St Helens a 17-year-old was stabbed by an attacker brandishing a "huge knife" at a fireworks display.</p>
      <p>A witness told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/traumatised-child-4-who-saw-17207537">Liverpool Echo</a> her four-year-old son was traumatised by the incident.</p>
      <p>She said: "My four-year-old is absolutely traumatised.</p>
      <p>"He's asking me 'why did the naughty boys have a knife' and he's asking if 'the naughty boys with the knife know where we live.'</p>
      <p>"He told me he's trying to be brave but said he wished he'd given 'the naughty boy a punch'."</p>
