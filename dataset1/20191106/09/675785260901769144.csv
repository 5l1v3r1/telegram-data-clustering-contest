West Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Damien Miller said: “We made it clear from the outset that any instances of disorder or antisocial behaviour would not be tolerated and we were able to quickly respond.
“Those individuals that engage in such behaviour are within the minority and do not represent the wider community.”

""Everyone was fleeing for their lives whilst trying to shop.
""A group of 20 were shooting fireworks at each other, including rockets.""

""Attacks like these are completely unacceptable #BonfireNight""
North Wales Police said groups of yobs had launched fireworks at emergency service workers in Wrexham, North Wales Live reports .
A spokesman said: A spokesman said: ""We have received reports that youths in  Wrexham  are throwing fireworks at our colleagues from  North Wales Fire and Rescue Service .
""Please do not endanger lives with such mindless acts.
""Our officers will deal robustly with anyone seen acting in this way.""
Following a similar incident in Edinburgh, police posted pictures of rockets on Twitter, writing: ""As part of Operation Moonbeam & proactive policing in Edinburgh this evening & following an incident involving fireworks being aimed at police, two men have been arrested for providing fireworks to youths.
""Their van was seized & they will be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.""
In St Helens a 17-year-old was stabbed by an attacker brandishing a ""huge knife"" at a fireworks display.
A witness told the Liverpool Echo her four-year-old son was traumatised by the incident.
She said: ""My four-year-old is absolutely traumatised.
""He's asking me 'why did the naughty boys have a knife' and he's asking if 'the naughty boys with the knife know where we live.'
""He told me he's trying to be brave but said he wished he'd given 'the naughty boy a punch'.""
