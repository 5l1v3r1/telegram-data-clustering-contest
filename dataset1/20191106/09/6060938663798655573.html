      <h1>Lin Dan's China Open exit new blow to fading Olympic hopes</h1>

      <p>SHANGHAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lin-Dan">Lin Dan</a>'s unlikely bid for a third Olympic gold suffered another blow on Wednesday when he lost in the first round of the Fuzhou China Open to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chen-Long">Chen Long</a>.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old Lin, arguably the greatest <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> player of all time, won the first game 21-19 against his fellow Chinese.</p>
      <p>But Chen, the 2016 Rio Olympics gold medallist, came back to win the next two 21-12, 21-12 and send a wilting Lin home early.</p>
      <p>Lin, a five-time world champion and the 2008 and 2012 Olympic champion, has now lost eight times in the first round of tournaments this year.</p>
      <p>Once the world number one, his ranking has fallen to 18th.</p>
      <p>Chen and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shi-Yuqi">Shi Yuqi</a> are third and fourth respectively and in pole position to represent China next summer in Tokyo, as long as they remain ahead of Lin at the April 2020 cut-off.</p>
      <p>Shi is coming back from an ankle problem and more injuries for him could be Lin's best hope for making the China team for Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Shi, the third seed, defeated South Korea's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Son-Wan-Ho">Son Wan-Ho</a> 21-17, 21-17.</p>
      <p>Lin, who earned the nickname "Super Dan" during his pomp, has always said that he wanted to end his career with another tilt at Games gold.</p>
      <p>With that prospect looking increasingly remote, Chinese media have speculated that he could announce his retirement imminently.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, defending Fuzhou champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kento-Momota">Kento Momota</a>, the world number one from Japan, defeated Daren Liew when the Malaysian retired.</p>
