      <p>SANIBEL, Fla. -- A heads up if you're going to Sanibel on Wednesday or Thursday; FDOT workers will be working on the second span of the Sanibel causeway.</p>
      <p>The good news is that it won't impact getting on or off the island Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The workers will be on a barge underneath the bridge doing inspections on the span. That'll last from 10 a.m. until about 3p.m.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, however, traffic could be slowed. Crews will be working on the first part of the bridge and will have to shut down a lane to get their work done.</p>
      <p>That'll also be from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m.</p>
