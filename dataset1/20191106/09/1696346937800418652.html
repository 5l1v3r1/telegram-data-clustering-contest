        <b>Bitcoin transactions have been exploding recently, and the network managed to collect over half a million in fees within only 24 hours.</b>

      <p>The last several days have been pretty happening for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-breaks-12k-on-argentinian-crypto-exchange/">bitcoin</a>. This time, the benchmark cryptocurrency did not see a massive surge that added thousands of dollars to its price, but it did make a few milestones, of sorts.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Transaction Fees Hit New Milestones</h3>
      <p>Only a week ago, on October 30th, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/bitcoin-enters-selling-trend-as-10-000-level-serves-as-barrier">bitcoin</a> network surpassed $1 billion in cumulative fee revenue, which is quite an important milestone.</p>

      <p>Now, however, BTC is once again a topic of conversations and speculations as it reportedly collected over $500,000 in transaction fees within only 24 hours.</p>

      <p>As many are likely aware, the bitcoin blockchain is not among the fastest ones out there. In fact, it might be among the slowest ones, with only 5-7 transactions being processed per block, each of which requires around 10 minutes to be solved, on an average. This can lead to some prolonged waiting periods to have a transaction processed.</p>
      <p>However, the network also allows users to choose how large of a fee they are willing to pay. Higher fees get the advantage, and so transactions that pay more end up being processed faster.</p>
      <h3>BTC Forks and Altcoins not Faring So Well</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the number of BTC users continues to appreciate, which leads to even higher fees. As mentioned, bitcoin has collected over $500k in fees within only 24 hours. At the same time, other bitcoin forks are not seeing nearly as high transaction fee count. BSV has collected only $220 within 24 hours, while BCH has even less, only $200.</p>
      <p>As for other well-known coins, Ethereum managed to collect $96,000, while Litecoin only has $840.</p>
