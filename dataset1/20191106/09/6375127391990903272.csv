A notorious drug den in Talisay City in Cebu province was dismantled by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency during an anti-narcotics operation which led in the arrest of six suspects and the confiscation of nearly P90,000 worth of shabu, PDEA chair, Director General Aaron N. Aquino said yesterday.
The official identified one of the arrested suspects as Edilberto  Endriga Jr., the 61-year old maintainer of the raided drug dive in Barangay San Roque in Talisay City.
The other suspects arrested were  the drug den visitors Ariel Abangan, 41; Joseph Villa, 42; Roy Mahilum, 38; Richard Abangan, 41; and Art Clinton Sabado, 27.
Aquino said that members of the PDEA Regional Office 7, joined by the local police recovered 11 heat-sealed plastic sachets containing around 13 grams of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ worth P88,600, various drug paraphernalia and the marked money paid by a poseur to Endriga during the initial buy-bust operation.
The suspects are now facing charges for violation of Section 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs), Section 6 (Maintenance of a Drug Den), Section 7 (Visitors of a Drug Den), Section 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs), and Section 12 (Possession of Drug Paraphernalia), Article II of Republic Act 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, Aquino said.
