06 Nov 2019, 09:46 by 張詠淇
唐從聖上 TVBS歡樂台《食尚玩家－歡樂有夠讚》，聊到戀愛中的暖心舉動，唐從聖自認非浪漫派，私下也不愛買名牌，但和現在老婆交往時，有感女生騎機車工作太危險，就買車當生日禮物送對方。
私下不買名牌的唐從聖，也不愛人送禮，連自己舞台劇演出也不要人送花，因為不講究排場的他認為送花奢侈又不實用，「寧願他們把錢省下來買票，或請朋友來看演出，一起去吃吃喝喝也好。」尤其後來他當爸後知道生產的辛苦，也不太過生日了。
唐從聖和老婆愛情長跑多年結婚，回想兩人交往第2年，他看到女生因為是四處兼課的舞蹈老師，所以長時間騎車在外，「看她騎車危險性很高，又有空氣汙染，我就想說不行，一定要弄一台車。」從沒送過鑽戒或花等禮物的唐從聖，花了4個月做功課，偷偷問對方喜好，等到女友生日當天早上，就將車子停在樓下給她驚喜！唐從聖透露和老婆交往至今雖沒高潮起伏，但也平淡幸福，唐從聖說：「我們從不吵架，也沒大聲過，就是互相退讓。」展現其務實又貼心的一面。
常出外景的郭彥均，只要是工作出國，從不帶信用卡或外幣出門，他解釋：「因為如果帶錢出門，很怕第一天就手滑亂買東西。」沒想到某次抵達外國第1天，就發現行李不見，他情急下只好跟主持搭檔阿諾借衣服，「所以那時錄影我前3天都穿同一件衣服，有幾天還穿女裝，只是大家沒發現。」最慘的是7天外景，直到他要回台灣的時候導遊才說行李箱找到了！郭彥均因體諒老婆單親，主動提出每年過年除夕當天中午，就先跟郭媽媽一起吃團圓飯，到傍晚再趕回岳母家，一起吃年夜飯。郭彥均25歲還在當救生員時就和老婆交往，他曾拿女方身分證去偷辦護照，再買機票當生日禮物送給對方，十分會耍浪漫。

Tang Congsheng worried about his girlfriend riding a bicycle.
06 Nov 2019, 09:46 by Zhang Yiqi
Tang Congsheng on TVBS Happy Taiwan ""Food is still a player - joy is enough to praise"", talked about the warm heart in love, Tang Congsheng self-recognition non-romantic, privately do not like to buy famous brands, but when interacting with his wife, there is a sense of girls riding a locomotive If the work is too dangerous, buy a car and give it to the other party as a birthday present.
Don’t buy brand-name Tang Congsheng privately, and don’t love people to give gifts. Even his own stage performances don’t give people flowers. Because he doesn’t pay attention to the market, he thinks that it’s extravagant and unpractical. “I’d rather save money to buy tickets, or ask friends to see It’s good to go to eat and drink together.” Especially after he became a dad, he knew the hard work of production, and he didn’t have a birthday.
Tang Congsheng and his wife love to run for many years and marry. Looking back at the second year of the two-person relationship, he saw that the girl was riding a bicycle for a long time because she was a dance teacher who was a part-time class. ""Looking at her risk of riding a bicycle is high, and there is air pollution. I just want to say no, I have to get a car."" Tang Congsheng, who has never given a diamond ring or a gift, spent four months doing homework and secretly asking each other's preferences. When the girlfriend's birthday was on the morning, he parked the car on the floor. Surprise her! Tang Congsheng revealed that he did not have a climax and ups and downs, but he was also flat and happy. Tang Congsheng said: ""We never quarrel, nor loudly, or give up each other."" Show its pragmatic and caring side.
Guo Yanjun, who often comes out of the scene, as long as he is working abroad and never goes out with a credit card or foreign currency, he explained: ""Because if you bring money out, I am afraid that I will buy things on the first day."" I did not expect to arrive in a foreign country for the first time. In the day, I found that my baggage was gone. He had to borrow clothes from the host partner Arnold in an emergency. ""So I was wearing the same clothes for the first 3 days, and I wore women's clothes for a few days, but everyone didn't find it."" It was a 7-day exterior, and it was not until he was going back to Taiwan that the tour guide said that the suitcase was found! Guo Yanjun, for the sake of understanding his wife's single parent, offered to have a reunion dinner with Guo mother on the day of the New Year's Eve, and then went back to the mother-in-law's house in the evening to eat New Year's Eve together. When Guo Yanjun was still a lifeguard at the age of 25, he was associated with his wife. He used to take the woman’s identity card to steal the passport, and then bought the ticket as a birthday present to the other party, which would be very romantic.
