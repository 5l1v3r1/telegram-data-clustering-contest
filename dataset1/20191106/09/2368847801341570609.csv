06 Nov 2019, 09:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】新唐人為讀者推薦每日精彩文章和視頻節目：
四中全會真出大事？王小洪兼任特勤局長不尋常中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒在四中全會期間離奇死亡，引發外界對中共權斗出大事的猜測之際，中共公安部副書記王小洪兼任中共新設機構特勤局局長，引發輿論關注 。有分析人士認為，此安排不尋常。
見證中共歷次危機 揭密京西賓館發生的大事中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒在中共四中全會期間離奇死亡、地點是四中全會召開的京西賓館。戒備森嚴的京西賓館再次引發輿論關注，該處是中共高層會議主要召開之地，同時也見證了中共歷次危機。
「元朗疑凶」何君堯屯門遇刺 中刀過程曝光被外界視為7.21元朗恐襲幕後黑手的香港親共立法會議員何君堯，6日早上遭人刺傷送院。港人懷疑何是玩「苦肉計」，又想造假拉票。
韓正挺林鄭港警「再前進」 言論比習還狠香港特首林鄭月娥獲習近平「高度信任」後，今天（11月6日）又首次在北京與中共副總理韓正公開會面。主管港澳事務的韓正力挺林鄭和港警「往前進」，言論比習近平還狠。外界猜測，韓正或藉此機會向林鄭下達四中全會的所有指令，利用她為當局幹完所有髒活。
習近平送大禮 換來馬克龍當面批評北京「送大禮」換取法國總統馬克龍出席在上海舉行的進博會，然而，中共的「大撒幣外交」未能平息馬克龍的不滿。他在開幕式上當面批評習近平，指中共的開放跟其貿易夥伴長期不對稱，並警告北京若不改變將遭到報復。
香港科大生墜樓案疑點重重 目擊者詳述細節22歲的科技大學二年級學生周梓樂，4日凌晨於將軍澳尚德停車場高處墮下，術後情況仍然危殆。警方5日晚在警察總部召開記者會，講述事件最新調查進展，否認傷者被警員推落樓。但港媒訪問多名目擊者，發現事件疑點重重。
大陸颳起姓黨風 民企：有點像「私生子」近年來，中共加強對民營企業的控制，促使私營企業紛紛加強所謂的「黨建設」。對此，有自媒體說，目前，中國颳起「姓黨」風，各行各業競相認中共為「爸爸」，民企也自稱姓黨有點像「私生子」。
「殺豬盤」啟動？山西柳林首富被判死緩 罰沒百億日前山西當局以「打黑除惡」為名，將柳林首富陳鴻志判處死緩和巨額罰金。在中共搶劫私產填補政府財政的大背景下，網民熱評中共「殺豬盤」啟動，重慶「唱紅打黑」模式將擴展全國。
鐵證:「港警」當街飆普通話訓便衣「你不配做軍人」(視頻)中共軍警假扮香港警察或混入人群，殘酷鎮壓港人抗爭，已成公開的秘密。中共軍警也越來越不加掩飾。日前網傳視頻顯示，一名「港警」在街頭用普通話訓斥一名便衣，該名便衣還向他敬軍禮做解釋。
習「高度信任」林鄭？學者：下台前的安慰習近平日前在上海與香港特首林鄭月娥會面，並對其表示「高度信任」，引發外界諸多解讀。有學者認為，北京對林鄭的信任僅是「暫時性」，不代表北京喜歡或肯定林鄭的表現，很可能僅是「下台前的安慰」。
對抗一帶一路 美國正式推出「藍點計劃」美國商務部長羅斯週二表示，美國將在亞洲增加投資和貿易，而即將推出的「藍點網絡」計劃即旨在幫助亞洲「永續發展」。有英媒披露，由美國領導的「藍點網絡計劃」將審核並認證項目，從而促進「市場驅動、透明且財務可持續的基礎設施發展」。輿論認為，美國推出「藍點網絡計劃」是為了對抗中共的「一帶一路」。
美商務部長：美中離簽協議「相距甚遠」美中原定簽署「第一階段貿易協議」的日期臨近，但雙方敲定協議的高階談判依然遙遙無期。雖然美中官方都在公開釋放「樂觀」信號，但據美媒消息，美國商務部長羅斯剛剛在曼谷的商務會議上透露，離協議還「相距甚遠」。
川普首將香港納入印太戰略：保障言論和集會自由本屆東盟峰會上，川普特使批評中共的「新帝國主義」，美國國務院發表報告闡述川普政府「印太戰略」實施進度時，也譴責中共將對國內的壓迫輸出到其它地區。報告還敦促中共遵守《中英聯合聲明》，保障香港人權。
習近平晤林鄭只談「信任」 港媒析弦外之音中國國家主席習近平日前在上海會見了香港特首林鄭月娥。官媒報導習表態對林鄭「高度信任」，外界解讀為給林鄭及其團隊「打強心針」。有港媒援引時事評論人士觀點指出，習對林鄭的這番表態暗藏弦外之音，不代表北京會長期支持林鄭，將來需要「犧牲」時，林鄭仍隨時可被問責下台。
中共「全過程民主」搞暈全球 外媒連批「羊頭狗肉」中共四中全會提出所謂「中國之治」，習近平在上海又提「全過程民主」，這些怪異措辭令全球網民費解。多家外媒紛紛解讀，批評所謂「中國之治」就是專制統治，「全過程民主」不過是「掛羊頭賣狗肉」。
林鄭見習近平獲「保命符」？專家：錯了中國國家主席習近平昨天(4日)晚上，在上海接見了出席中國進博會的香港特首林鄭月娥。陸媒報導稱，習近平肯定林鄭，要求林鄭做好與社會各界對話和改善民生等工作，消息引起多位香港議員強烈不滿，不過，有評論家指出，林鄭仍然有可能被趕下台。

[Wonderful recommendation] Lin Zheng is a life preserver? /He Jun’s assassination

06 Nov 2019, 09:36

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] New Tang Dynasty people recommend daily wonderful articles and video programs for readers:
Is the Fourth Plenary Session a big event? Wang Xiaohong, who is also the director of the special secret service, Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, died bizarrely during the Fourth Plenary Session, triggering speculation that the CCP’s power to fight the big things. Wang Xiaohong, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party’s public security department, also serves as the director of the new CCP’s new agency, causing public concern. . Some analysts believe that this arrangement is unusual.
Witnessing the CCP's previous crises Uncovering the major events in the Jingxi Hotel, Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, died in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party. The venue was the Beijing West Hotel, which was held at the Fourth Plenary Session. The heavily guarded Jingxi Hotel once again sparked public concern. The office was the main venue for the CCP's high-level meeting, and it also witnessed the CCP's successive crises.
""Yuanlang suspected"" He Jun was attacked by the slasher. The process of the knives was seen by the outside world as a black-handed member of the Hong Kong pro-Communist legislator He Junyi, who was stabbed in the morning on the 6th. The Hong Kong people suspected that they were playing the ""bitter plan"" and wanted to make fake tickets.
Han Zhengting, Lin Zhenggang, ""Going Forward"" The remarks are still after the Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue received the ""high trust"" from Xi Jinping. Today (November 6), he met with the Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng for the first time in Beijing. Han Zhengli, who is in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, is quite a leader of Lin Zheng and the Hong Kong Police. The remarks are even worse than Xi Jinping. It is speculated that Han Zheng will take this opportunity to give Lin Zheng all the instructions of the Fourth Plenary Session and use her to do all the dirty work for the authorities.
Xi Jinping sent a gift in exchange for Mark Long’s face-to-face criticism of Beijing’s “send a gift” in exchange for French President Mark Long’s attendance at the Expo in Shanghai. However, the CCP’s “great currency diplomacy” failed to quell the dissatisfaction of Mark Long. At the opening ceremony, he criticized Xi Jinping in person, referring to the long-term asymmetry between the CCP's opening and its trading partners, and warned that Beijing would be retaliated if it did not change.
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology students fell into a suspected case. Eyewitness details details 22-year-old second-year student of the University of Science and Technology Zhou Yule, on the morning of the 4th in the parking lot of the Suntech parking lot in Tseung Kwan O, the postoperative situation is still critical. The police held a press conference at the police headquarters on the evening of the 5th to tell the latest investigation of the incident and denied that the injured were pushed down by the police. However, the Hong Kong media visited a number of witnesses and found that the incident was very serious.
The mainland is blowing up the name of the party. Private enterprises: a bit like ""illegitimate children"" In recent years, the CCP has strengthened its control over private enterprises, prompting private companies to strengthen the so-called ""party building."" In this regard, some media said that at present, China has a ""name of the party"" style, and all walks of life compete to recognize the CCP as ""dad"". Private enterprises also claim that the surname party is a bit like ""illegitimate son.""
""Pig pig"" started? The richest man in Liulin, Shanxi Province, was sentenced to death. The penalty was not over 10 billion. In the name of “blackening and evil”, the Shanxi provincial government sentenced Liu Lin’s richest man, Chen Hongzhi, to a murder and a huge fine. Under the background of the CCP’s looting of private property to fill the government’s finances, netizens’ hot criticism of the CCP’s “killing pigs” was launched, and Chongqing’s “singing red and black” model will be extended nationwide.
Ironclad card: ""Hong Kong Police"" is a plain-speaking plainclothes ""You are not worthy of being a soldier"" (video) The Chinese Communists and the police have pretended to be Hong Kong policemen or mixed into the crowd. The brutal suppression of the people of Hong Kong has become an open secret. The CCP military police are becoming more and more undisguised. A recent video from the Internet shows that a ""Hong Kong Police"" reprimanded a plainclothes in the streets with Mandarin. The plainclothes also explained his military service.
Learning ""high trust"" Lin Zheng? Scholar: Xi Jinping, a former comforter before he stepped down, met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai and expressed ""high trust"" and triggered many interpretations. Some scholars believe that Beijing's trust in Lin Zheng is only ""temporary"". It does not mean that Beijing likes or affirms Lin Zheng's performance. It is likely to be only ""comfort before coming down.""
Fighting the Belt and Road The United States officially launched the ""Blue Dot Program"" US Commerce Secretary Ross said on Tuesday that the United States will increase investment and trade in Asia, and the forthcoming ""Blue Dot Network"" program is designed to help Asia ""sustainable development."" According to British media, the US-led Blue Point Network Program will review and certify projects to promote ""market-driven, transparent and financially sustainable infrastructure development."" Public opinion believes that the United States launched the ""Blue Point Network Plan"" to counter the CCP's ""Belt and Road.""
US Secretary of Commerce: The US-China agreement to sign the agreement is ""far apart."" The date when the US-China agreement to sign the ""first-phase trade agreement"" is approaching, but the high-level negotiations between the two sides to finalize the agreement are still in the foreseeable future. Although the US and Chinese officials are publicly releasing the ""optimistic"" signal, according to US media, US Commerce Secretary Ross just revealed at the business meeting in Bangkok that it is ""a far cry from the agreement.""
Trump first introduces Hong Kong into India-Pacific strategy: guarantee freedom of speech and assembly At this ASEAN summit, Trump specializes in criticizing the ""new imperialism"" of the CCP, and the US State Department issued a report on the progress of the implementation of the ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" of the Trump administration. It also condemned the CCP’s export of domestic oppression to other regions. The report also urges the CCP to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and protect human rights in Hong Kong.
Xi Jinping's meeting with Lin Zheng only talks about ""trust"" Hong Kong media analyzes the sound of the strings. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai. The official media report is ""highly trusting"" for Lin Zheng, and the outside world interprets it as ""a strong shot"" for Lin Zheng and his team. Some Hong Kong media quoted current affairs commentators as saying that the fact that Xi’s statement on Lin Zheng’s appearance is not a sign that Beijing will support Lin Zheng for a long time. When Zheng Sai needs to be sacrificed, Lin Zheng can still be held accountable at any time.
The CCP's ""full-process democracy"" has stunned the world. The foreign media has even approved the ""Sheep and Dog Meat"". The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has proposed the so-called ""governance of China."" Xi Jinping also proposed ""the whole process of democracy"" in Shanghai. These weird wordings have made the global netizens understand. A number of foreign media have interpreted and criticized the so-called ""governance of China"" as an authoritarian rule. ""The whole process of democracy"" is nothing more than ""selling sheep and selling dog meat.""
Lin Zheng’s trainee Jin Ping won the “Buffalo”? Expert: Wrong Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue, who attended the China Expo, in Shanghai yesterday (4th). Lu Media reported that Xi Jinping affirmed Lin Zheng and asked Lin Zheng to do a good job in dialogue with the community and improve people's livelihood. The news caused strong dissatisfaction among many Hong Kong lawmakers. However, some commentators pointed out that Lin Zheng may still be ousted.
