韓國瑜12強棒球賽加油影片太混　劉寶傑怒批3大罪狀
06 Nov 2019, 09:13 by 謝文哲
2019年世界12強棒球錦標賽開打，各縣市首長為了幫中華隊加油，紛紛拍攝應援影片，不過高雄市長韓國瑜拍的應援短片，卻被劉寶傑怒批「格式不對」「沒有字幕」「沒有道具」3大罪狀。



昨（5日）劉寶傑主持的《關鍵時刻》節目中，點評各縣市長拍攝的12強棒球錦標賽加油影片，劉寶傑認為所有縣市長都卯足全力幫中華隊加油，但韓國瑜居然是最混的。








劉寶傑嗆韓國瑜，「你現在沒有工作，你也不趕高雄，你也不去總質詢，還有你的選舉也是選得零零落落，叫你去給人家加油，第一個，影片格式不對；第二，他連字幕都沒有；第三，每個人都有設計道具，他連一個加油棒都沒有。」








來賓財經專家黃世聰則認為，沒有比較沒有傷害，看到別的縣市首長，再看到韓國瑜「根本完全在混」，其他縣市長還會出外景甚至結合當地觀光，他批評，韓國瑜的影片也不知道在講什麼，所有縣市首長中只有韓一個人請假，一天的行程也才兩三個，但影片成果出來卻這麼混。

Liu Baojie 呛 South Korea Yu, ""You don't have a job right now, you don't catch up with Kaohsiung, you don't go to the general question, and your election is also chosen to be a good one, asking you to cheer for others. The first one, the film format is wrong. Second, he doesn't even have subtitles. Third, everyone has design props. He doesn't even have a fuel stick.""








Huang Shicong, a guest financial expert, believes that there is no harm, seeing the heads of other counties and cities, and then seeing that South Korea’s Yu is “completely mixed”, other county mayors will also come out and even combine local sightseeing.
