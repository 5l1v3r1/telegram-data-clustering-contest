      <p>Drama ensued at the High Court of Eldoret after a suspect in a murder case was attacked by the victim’s mother.</p>
      <p>Beatrice Wanyota, the mother to slain Vera Beauty college student Emma Wanyota aged 26, went berserk in court claiming that the case involving her daughter was being delayed.</p>
      <p>She pounced on the suspect, Mustafa Idd aged 31 and caught the police and lawyers unaware, slapping and punching him while wailing that he was her daughter’s killer.</p>
      <p>“You are the one who killed my daughter and I am so angry with you. Whenever I come to court for my daughter’s case, the matter is always postponed ostensibly to pave the way for mental assessment of the accused,” said the frustrated mother.</p>

      <p>Emma Wanyota’s body was found in a pool of blood around a farm near her home with her legs and arms chopped off.</p>
      <p>The suspect, Mustafa Idd was the last person to be in contact with her, with other evidences linking him to the murder.</p>
      <p>The judge in charge of the case, Justice Stephen Githinji had ordered for a mental assessment of the suspect before the proceedings were commenced.</p>
      <p>“As a matter of procedure, anybody charged with murder must first undergo a mental assessment before he is allowed to take the plea. The accused is not yet off the hook.”</p>
