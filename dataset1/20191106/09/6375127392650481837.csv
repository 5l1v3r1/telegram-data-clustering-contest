Tagudin, Ilocos Sur Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez was shot dead by still unidentified assailants late afternoon last Tuesday.
The Office of the Court Administrator disclosed that Bañez, 54, was on his way to his home in La Union when unidentified suspects shot him at close range.
Bañez was rushed to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival.
He was the fifth active judge killed since the start of the administration of President Duterte.
Meanwhile, Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta condemned the killing of Bañez and called on law enforcement agencies to “exert their best efforts and be relentless in their investigation.”
“On behalf of the Judiciary, I strongly condemn the killing of Regional Trial Court Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur. I call on the law enforcement agencies to exert their best efforts and be relentless in their investigation for the immediate apprehension of those responsible for this atrocious and dastardly act. I also extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Judge Bañez,” he said in a statement.
