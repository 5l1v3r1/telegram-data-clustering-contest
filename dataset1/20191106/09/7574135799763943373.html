      <p>Experimental pop artist <b>Katie Gately</b> is finally following her <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/10-overlooked-albums-of-2016/">very promising</a> 2016 debut album <i>Color</i> (Tri Angle Records) with a sophomore LP, <i>Loom</i>, due February 14 via Houndstooth (<a href="https://hndsth.lnk.to/KatieGately">pre-order</a>). The album is dedicated to her mother who passed away in 2018 due to a rare form of cancer, and Katie says she abandoned an “entirely different” album she was working on in the process, and then rebuilt the new album around the ten-minute song “Bracer,” which was her mother’s favorite. That track — which samples “a coffin closing, elephant trumpets, shovels digging, a machine gun, meat smacking, and a cantaloupe being stabbed” — is the album’s first single, and it’s a highly adventurous piece of art pop that takes lots of twists and turns and really earns its lengthy running time. It comes with a visual made by Brian Cantrell. Check it out below.</p>
