      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=a6c0365b4daf7040f46d81ed9dcd814f&amp;language=en_US">Amazon's Echo Buds</a> may be able to track your workouts in the future if ever the company decides to release a feature it's testing. <i>CNBC</i> reporter Todd Haselton has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/amazon-echo-buds-fitness-tracking-appears-in-alexa-software.html">discovered</a> an experimental feature when it paired the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/amazon-echo-buds-review/#/">AirPods rival</a> with the Alexa app on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/07/amazon-fire-hd-10-2019-announcement/">Amazon Fire HD 10</a> tablet and an iPhone. He noticed a new "Fitness" section inside settings where you'd typically go to adjust the earbuds' equalizer. The section still looks pretty bare, but it does include the option to track a workout that you'd have to toggle on.</p>

      <p>Going through the section, Haselton found that he could start tracking his activities with a voice command: "Alexa, start a workout." The voice assistant responded with "OK, starting your workout," and Echo Buds appeared to track his movement as he walked around. After he was done, Alexa gave him a summary of his activity, including his time, miles, steps and average pace.</p>
      <p>Tracking steps seems to be all the Buds can do at this time, though that could change if Amazon decides to give the feature a wide release. Take note that the test feature only just showed up and is only available on certain devices, so it may be a long time before it becomes available to the public. When asked for comment, an Amazon spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on rumors or speculation.</p>
