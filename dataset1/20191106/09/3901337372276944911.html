      <p>Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Lebese is a man on a mission and has intensified his efforts in search of a club. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Lebese, who was on the books of defending PSL Champions, Mamelodi Sundowns as well as a loan stint with SuperSport United, has taken to Instagram to show just how serious he is about returning to the pitch.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has been clubless since departing from Downs at the end of last season and is a free agent, who can join any interested team locally or abroad.</p>

      <p> Lebese has hit the gym and hard! The left footed dribbling wizard enlisted the services of personal trainer, Tebogo Mashalane as he looks to get into the best shape possible.</p>
      <p>Fans will remember that his former coach Pitso Mosimane highlighted the fact that Lebese carried some extra weight when he joined the team from Kaizer Chiefs a few seasons ago.</p>
      <p>A much slimmer Lebese shared some highlights of his workout on his Instagram page.</p>
