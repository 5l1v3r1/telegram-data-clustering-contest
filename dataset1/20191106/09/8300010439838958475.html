      <p>BRENTWOOD, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A Brentwood woman lost her home in the Getty Fire, but firefighters were miraculously able to find and return one of her most prized possessions.<br/><br/>An assistant fire chief going through the neighborhood after the flames were out came across a small, waterlogged jewelry box on the ground outside Patty Shales' burned-out home.<br/><br/>Inside was her mother's wedding ring, relatively untouched by the flames.<br/><br/>Shales' mother died last November of Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>"She was really a special person," Shales said. "And I feel that she sent me this to tell me that she's in Heaven and she's OK. And I'm gonna be OK. I totally have that spiritual connection. I just feel so blessed and so grateful for the firemen."<br/><br/>This was the second house fire the family - and the ring - survived. Shales' parents had escaped a burning home in Las Vegas in 1994.<br/><br/>Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Jamie Moore recalled the moment he told Shales about her home - and the ring.<br/><br/>"I had the unfortunate task of telling her her house had been destroyed," Moore said. "But I told her hold on a minute, I might have something for her."<br/><br/>He held out the box and barely got the words out to ask her when she exclaimed "That's my mom's wedding ring box!"<br/><br/>The ring had been stored in another box in the back of a closet in the home.<br/><br/>Shales say she is grateful that she, her daughter and her dog survived the fire.<br/><br/>And seeing the ring again brought her some degree of peace.<br/><br/>"It's just unbelievable, really," Shales said. "It's a total miracle."</p>
