Facebook will soon require a selfie of your face from different angles to confirm your profile. The social network is testing a new identity verification method that seems to use facial recognition technology to identify fake accounts.
Facebook: confirmation of identity
Facebook has nearly 2.5 billion active users worldwide and among them are many fake accounts. To fix this problem, they are testing a new identity verification method. That requires a live video of your face from different angles.
The feature was unveiled by Jane Manchun Wong, a programmer now well known for spotting features under development in the most popular applications. Yesterday, she posted a GIF on her Twitter account offering an overview of the new identity verification method. The information has since been confirmed by Facebook.
A video of your face soon needed to validate your profile



Specifically, the social network has developed a new interface that requires users to film their faces while moving their heads in all directions in the middle of a circle, as you would when configuring the unlocking facial recognition on your smartphone. The goal is to ban fake accounts operated by robots, as explained by Facebook to the Venturebeat website while denying the use of its facial recognition technologies.
“The method is to determine that it is a real person who operates an account rather than a bot”. Said a Facebook spokesman. “It does not use facial recognition. But only detects the movements of the head and checks whether a face is in the video”. Officially, Facebook will delete this data. It remains to see whether this declaration of good faith will be enough. To convince everyone who knows the reputation of the social network.
