EPCR Considering Action After Saracens No Show At Official Launch
06 Nov 2019, 09:41 by Sean McMahon

EPCR, the governing body of European club rugby, have released a brief statement stating their disappointment with Saracens not attending the official launch of the Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup today in Cardiff.

Today’s event in Cardiff sees all participating teams in the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup represented by respective coaches and players where among other things, they must conduct interviews with the media.
It may not come as a surprise that the reigning European champions have not attended considering Tuesday’s landmark ruling from Premiership Rugby that the club are to be docked 35 points and fined over £5 million due to alleged breaches of the salary cap.





“EPCR is disappointed to learn of Saracens’ decision to make their club representatives unavailable for today’s official 2019/20 Season Launch of the Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup in Cardiff,” a statement read.“EPCR will now consider what action is appropriate in this instance and will be making no further comment at this time.”
A spokesperson for EPCR told Pundit Arena on Tuesday that the ruling from Premiership Rugby will have no impact on the club’s European record or the club’s participation in this season’s Champions Cup despite many suggestions that the integrity surrounding their European Cup triumphs have been tainted.



Saracens are away to Gloucester this Saturday in Round 4 of the Premiership so with media duties still set to take place pre and post-match, we should hear from the players and Director of Rugby Mark McCall in the coming days.
