      <h1>Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp reveals he agreed to Carabao Cup fixture because he did not want to upset EFL or Fifa</h1>
      <h2>The manager joked that the club asked Aston Villa to play the Carabao Cup quarter-final in Qatar</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T09:45:54+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Markham</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> joked they asked <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AstonVilla">Aston Villa</a> to travel to Qatar to play their <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/carabao-cup">Carabao Cup</a> quarter-final as he did not want to upset the EFL or Fifa.</p>
      <p>The club are to employ a split squad scenario after their last-eight tie was confirmed for its original date of December 17, the day before the team play a Club World Cup semi-final in Doha.</p>
      <p>Fixture congestion – the Reds have already had to postpone one Premier League match to fit in their trip to the Gulf – meant it was impossible to fit in the tie before the scheduled semi-final first leg in early January.</p>
      <p>So Liverpool have reluctantly agreed to fulfil both fixtures using the full extent of their extended first-team squad and youth team players.</p>
      <p>“We asked Aston Villa if they would come to Qatar and we can play the game there!” said Klopp.</p>
      <p>“We have an idea how we do it, but it’s too early to speak about it. We made a decision because all the other alternatives were more problems than solutions, so we said ‘OK’.</p>
      <p>“This is how we can do it as good as possible for us. We have a bit of time to think about that, and more important things to do.</p>
      <p>“In these next couple of weeks we will make a decision about how it will look exactly. But in the end, they will play a Liverpool team, 100 per cent.”</p>
      <p>Asked if they were put under pressure to play the League Cup game, he said: “Kind of! Do you want to be really in trouble with Fifa? No. Do we want to be in trouble with the EFL? Probably not. We respect the competition.</p>
      <p>“It sounds like we don’t like the Carabao Cup, which is not true. What I don’t like is that it’s two legs in the semi-final. I don’t understand that and I don’t like that in the busiest period.</p>
      <p>“The Club World Cup, you only play if you win the Champions League, and that doesn’t happen in your life five million times. You take the opportunity.”</p>
      <p>There is only one fixture which matters to Klopp’s side at the moment, however, and that is Sunday’s visit of Manchester City.</p>
      <p>That huge game between the Premier League’s top-two overshadowed the 2-1 Champions League victory over Genk which put the Reds top of their group and within one win of qualification to the knockout phase.</p>
      <p>“’Job done’ is the headline for the game, pretty much, but the group is not decided. It’s a tough group,” said Klopp after Georginio Wijnaldum and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored for a much-changed team either side of Ally Mbwana Samatta’s equaliser.</p>
      <p>“The most important thing; we won and nobody is injured. Apart from that, the result is the result because we didn’t finish our situations off like we should and could have done.”</p>
