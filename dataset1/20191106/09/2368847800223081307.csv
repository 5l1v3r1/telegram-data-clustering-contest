王友群：最邪惡最愚蠢的中國共產黨

06 Nov 2019, 09:24

今年是中共迫害法輪功20年。
20年來，中共花在迫害法輪功上的錢有多少？可能在數千億元人民幣以上！
20年來，中共花在迫害法輪功上的人力有多少？包括從中央到全國31個省、自治區、直轄市的各級610辦公室官員，中共公、檢、法、司數量龐大的警官、檢察官、法官、獄警，中共各級黨政軍學民機關的所有官員，城市最基層的居委會主任，農村最基層的村委會主任。
20年來，中共花在迫害法輪功上的物力有多少？中共所有的宣傳機器，遍及全國31個省、自治區、直轄市的各級各類洗腦班、看守所、勞教所、監獄內的一切設施，等等等等。
20年來，中共白白浪費了中國納稅人數不清的血汗錢，只為害人害己害子孫！
20年後的今天，中共傾舉國之力，把古今中外所有最流氓的手段全都使出來了，包括大規模活摘法輪功學員器官等；但是，中共沒有「戰勝法輪功」。相反，法輪功洪傳到了全世界100多個國家和地區。
有許多在中國大陸受到殘酷迫害、九死一生的法輪功學員，到了海外後，照樣堅持修煉法輪功，照樣堅持向世人講清「法輪大法好，真善忍好」的真相。
這裡，只講兩個案例。
1995年5月，清華大學博士研究生須寅開始修煉法輪功。
1995年7月，須寅獲博士學位，因品學兼優，被留校任教。
修煉法輪功之後，困擾須寅多年的失眠症一夜之間不翼而飛，校醫院再也沒有他看病的記錄，身心越來越健康。同時，他嚴格按照法輪功的核心理念「真、善、忍」做好人，獲得過清華大學「先進工作者」、「優秀教師獎」，北京市「教育教學成果（高等教育）一等獎」，「國家級教學成果一等獎」，教育部頒發的「在促進科技進步中作出重大貢獻獎」等。
有個學生在評語中寫道：「須寅教授是我從中學到大學以來遇到的最好的老師。」
1999年7月20日中共開始迫害法輪功之前，清華大學有11個煉功點。清華修煉法輪功的人包括教授、副教授、講師，博士生、碩士生、本科生，人數最多時，可能有500多人煉功。1998年，清華大學各系免試直接讀碩士學位或博士學位的12名研究生中，9名是法輪功學員。須寅親眼見證了許多人修煉法輪功後的奇蹟。
2006年3月13日早上，須寅像往常一樣，送女兒上學後，回家準備開始一天的工作。突然，十多個警察闖到他的家中，沒出示任何法律證件，就翻箱倒櫃，翻出幾本法輪功的書籍。然後，將須寅和他的妻子一起抓走。不久，須寅被非法「勞動教養」兩年，理由是他堅持修煉法輪功，家裡有法輪功的書籍。
中共迫害法輪功的一個重要手段，就是利用一切強迫命令手段，包括上百種酷刑，強迫法輪功學員「轉化」，即放棄對法輪功的信仰。
須寅被押解到北京市團河勞教所後，被單獨關在一個「小號」裡長達8個月，只許1/3的坐在一個30厘米高的小凳上，一整天面壁，不許動，不許閉眼睛，因為凳子又小又矮，且坐的受力面積小，時間一長疼痛難忍。這是一種軟暴力，表面上，警察沒有打你，罵你，但是，長時間這樣坐又小又矮的凳子，會令身心遭受巨大痛苦。不要說在嚴密監控下坐8個月，就是坐8天，就會令人痛苦萬分。這是一個極端邪惡的酷刑折磨方式！
在肉體和精神承受巨大痛苦的情況下，須寅與勞教所的警察展開了一場「轉化」與「反轉化」的較量。他回憶說：「我儘量用他們能明白的話講，特別我是個學理工科的教師，我用嚴密的科學思維邏輯與警察那種中共流氓式的政治邏輯抗衡，我從自然科學角度給他們證明法輪功是非常好的功法，他們無法推翻我用的自然科學邏輯，警察也覺得我是個思維理智的人。和他們一談就是很長時間。就這樣，一個自稱『全國轉化水平最高』的警察也理屈詞窮了。用他的話講，『我們這裡的警察沒有一個能說服你，我們這裡的錄像和書對你根本沒有用』。再後來，他們誰也不願和我談話了。」
2008年3月13日，須寅走出勞教所。警察對前來接他的清華大學領導說：『和沒進勞教所一樣，回去還得看緊』！」
中共迫害法輪功的另一個極端邪惡的手段，就是「從經濟上截斷」。凡是堅持修煉法輪功的人，一律不許在中共控制下的一切黨政機關、企事業單位工作，或開除公職，或辭退，或不簽聘用合同，把你的飯碗砸了！
須寅回到清華後，立即面臨被「經濟上截斷」的問題。校領導要求須寅必須寫認錯、不煉功的聲明，否則，就不續簽教師合同。須寅不願昧著良心寫這樣的虛假聲明。就因為堅持自己的信仰不動搖，這個深受學生歡迎的好老師，最終不得不離開中國。2008年8月27日，須寅一家三口，飛抵美國中部城市芝加哥。
須寅抵達美國後發表聲明說：「我愛我的工作崗位，我愛我的學生，我愛我的親人。我不願離棄生我養我的那片中華大地，我不願離開我熟悉的課堂和學生期待的目光。但是，在信仰與利益相互矛盾時，我要為我的學生做出示範：我為講真話，為揭露中共的迫害，為喚醒被中共邪惡謊言迷惑的民眾，我只能放棄我所熱愛的一切，離開中國，到我能講真話的地方表達心聲。」他說：「我要以我的親身經歷告訴我的學生和全世界的人：中共有罪。」
王為宇是我在北京市前進監獄第一分監區的難友，也是我見過的少有的天才學子。
在清華，王為宇照樣品學兼優，曾獲得過優秀學生獎學金、優良畢業生獎章、中國儀器儀表特等獎學金（首次授予本科學生）和飛利浦獎學金等。1996年本科畢業後，因成績優異，免試直接攻讀博士學位。
王為宇當過班長、團支部書記、系科協副主席、系團委副書記、97級本科生輔導員。就因為堅信法輪功，修煉法輪功，堅持在法輪功問題上講真話，王為宇一生最寶貴的青春年華，有8年半，是在中共的非法監禁中度過的。
2002年8月12日，正在一家外企打工的王為宇，在出差途中，被中共國安當「小偷」給抓走了。從此，直到2004年初，長達一年多的時間，王為宇被「人間蒸發」。期間，王為宇有半年多被關押北京天堂河一個無法無天、卻被稱為「法制培訓中心」的地方。這是一個高牆電網圍著、武警24小時看守著、對法輪功學員實行肉體和精神雙重摺磨的人間魔窟！
王為宇在這裡經歷了他有生以來最刻骨銘心的酷刑。他回憶說：「我經歷過一晚上的電刑。全身上下所有地方都被電過。十個手指頭全部被電過，他們把電棍放在我的脖子上，直到它放完電，最後來不及充電，直接插在220伏電壓的插座上電，電的滿屋子都是肉皮的焦糊味，直到電的昏死過去！」
然後，王為宇被祕密判刑8年，被押解到北京市前進監獄。這是專門關押被判刑的北京籍法輪功學員的人間魔窟，王為宇在這裡也遭受了各種酷刑折磨，身心受到嚴重摧殘。一次放風時，他的右腿跟腱被踢傷，前腳掌不能著地，拖了3個半月，獄方沒有安排任何檢查和治療，不僅如此，還強制他完成每天所有的體力勞動！
中共對天才學子王為宇的殘酷迫害，令王為宇一家人對中共徹底絕望，最後，一家人全部逃離中國。
2013年，王為宇逃離中國，與家人團聚。一到美國，王為宇立即投入到法輪功的修煉中。只要有時間，就堅持學法，煉功，積極參加法輪
功的各种活动，他的身体迅速恢复健康。作为嘉宾，王为宇参加了新唐人电视台拍摄的《细语人生——清华大学博士生的人生经历》（上、中、下）。链接如下：

【細語人生】清華大學博士生的人生經歷（上集）


【細語人生】清華大學博士生的人生經歷（中）


【細語人生】清華大學博士生的人生經歷（下）

現在，王為宇在美國一家世界500強企業工作。在中國大陸被迫與他離散8年半的妻子，與他在美國團圓。現在，他們有了一個活潑可愛的兒子。20年間，飽受磨難的王為宇一家人，經歷了許許多多的變化。只有一個不變，即堅持修煉法輪功不變！
如果沒有這場邪惡的迫害，王為宇可能成了一名優秀科學工作者，須寅可能成為桃李滿天下的教育家；如果沒有這場邪惡的迫害，中國修煉法輪功的群體中，會湧現出多少重德向善的傑出人才？然而，中共卻以最邪惡的方式迫害他們！
這些最優秀的中華兒女，歷經九九八十一難之後，來到有信仰自由的海外，都把法輪功視為他們生命中最重要的珍寶，堅定實修，重新煥發生命的活力，重鑄生命的輝煌。
也就是說，在中國大陸，中共用了20年時間，花費大量人力、物力、財力，強迫他們放棄信仰，到頭來，全部白費。尤其可悲的是，中共還在繼續浪費大量人力、物力、財力迫害法輪功。
天底下還有比中共更邪惡、更愚蠢的政黨嗎？
法輪功的偉大體現在許多方面。比如，在神州古國，重新喚醒了人們對於神的信仰與敬畏；比如，其淨化身心的奇效，受到超越國界、黨派、種族、性別、年齡、職業、語言、文化背景、宗教信仰的各階層人士發自內心的推崇。
尤其需要指出的是，與中共鎮壓法輪功靠強迫命令相反，法輪功洪傳於世，從未搞過任何強迫命令。
李洪志師父在《轉法輪》中反覆強調：「誰也不能強制你去修，那等於是在幹壞事。誰能強制你轉變你的心呢？」
11月1日，我在大紀元發表了《習近平在善惡間面臨最後選擇》。我寫道：「結束對法輪功的迫害，抓捕江澤民，解體中國共產黨，是神多少年前早就安排好了的事，誰也擋不住。」
「如果不想成為齊奧塞斯庫第二，習近平真得靜下心來好好想一想了。」
本文谈到的两个案例中的当事人，都是习近平的清华校友。希望习近平能够认真看一看，静心想一想。

Wang Youqun: The most evil and stupid Chinese Communist Party

06 Nov 2019, 09:24

This year is the CCP’s 20 years of persecution of Falun Gong.
In the past 20 years, how much has the CCP spent on persecuting Falun Gong? It may be hundreds of billions of yuan or more!
In the past 20 years, how many manpower did the CCP spend on persecuting Falun Gong? It includes 610 office officials from all levels of the province to the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The CCP has a large number of police officers, prosecutors, judges, prison guards, and all the cadres, political, and political institutions at all levels of the CCP. Officials, director of the most basic neighborhood committee in the city, director of the village committee at the grassroots level in rural areas.
In the past 20 years, how much material does the CCP spend on persecuting Falun Gong? All the propaganda machines of the CCP cover all kinds of brainwashing classes, detention centers, labor camps, and all facilities in prisons in 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country.
In the past 20 years, the CCP has wasted the hard-earned money of China’s taxpayers, and it’s only to harm others!
Today, 20 years later, the CCP has taken the power of the country to bring out all the most ruling methods in ancient and modern China and abroad, including the large-scale live harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners. However, the CCP has not ""victored Falun Gong."" On the contrary, Falun Gong has spread to more than 100 countries and regions around the world.
There are many Falun Gong practitioners who have been brutally persecuted and died in mainland China. After they have gone overseas, they still insist on practicing Falun Gong. They still insist on telling the truth about the truth of ""Falun Dafa is good, good and good.""
Here, only two cases are mentioned.
In May 1995, Ph.D. students at Tsinghua University began to practice Falun Gong.
In July 1995, he was required to obtain a doctorate. He was retained as a teacher because of his excellent academic performance.
After practicing Falun Gong, insomnia, which has been plagued for many years, has disappeared overnight. The school hospital has no record of his medical treatment, and his body and mind are getting healthier. At the same time, he strictly followed the core concept of Falun Gong, ""Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance"", and was awarded the ""Advanced Worker"" and ""Excellent Teacher Award"" by Tsinghua University and the ""First Prize of Education and Teaching Achievement (Higher Education)"" in Beijing. ""First Prize for National Teaching Achievements"", ""Major Contribution Award in Promoting Science and Technology Progress"" issued by the Ministry of Education.
One student wrote in the comments: ""Shou Shi is the best teacher I have ever met since I was in college.""
Before the CCP began persecuting Falun Gong on July 20, 1999, Tsinghua University had 11 practice sites. Tsinghua practitioners practicing Falun Gong include professors, associate professors, lecturers, doctoral students, master students, and undergraduates. When the number is the highest, more than 500 people may practice. In 1998, among the 12 graduate students of Tsinghua University who were directly exempted from master's or doctoral degrees, 9 were Falun Gong practitioners. Xu Yan witnessed the miracle of many people after practicing Falun Gong.
On the morning of March 13, 2006, Suzuki, as usual, sent her daughter to school and went home to start a day's work. Suddenly, more than a dozen police officers went to his home and did not show any legal documents. They rummaged through the cabinet and flipped out several Falun Gong books. Then, take the beggar and his wife together. Soon, he was illegally ""recruited by labor"" for two years on the grounds that he insisted on practicing Falun Gong and had books on Falun Gong at home.
An important means for the CCP to persecute Falun Gong is to use all means of forced command, including hundreds of kinds of torture, to force Falun Gong practitioners to ""transform"", that is, to abandon their faith in Falun Gong.
After being escorted to the Tuanhe Labor Camp in Beijing, he was escorted in a ""small"" for 8 months. Only one-third of the seats were sitting on a 30-cm-high stool. Do not move, do not allow to close your eyes, because the stool is small and short, and the area of the force of sitting is small, and the pain is unbearable for a long time. This is a kind of soft violence. On the surface, the police did not hit you and yell at you. However, sitting on a small, short stool for a long time would cause great pain to the body and mind. Don't say that sitting under strict supervision for 8 months is just 8 days, it will be very painful. This is an extremely evil way of torture torture!
In the case of physical and mental suffering, Sui has launched a ""conversion"" and ""reversal"" contest with the police of the labor camp. He recalled: ""I try to use what they can understand. In particular, I am a teacher of science and engineering. I use the rigorous scientific thinking logic to compete with the political logic of the CCP. I have proved Falun Gong from the perspective of natural science. It is a very good practice. They can't overthrow the natural science logic that I use. The police also think that I am a rational person. It is a long time to talk with them. In this way, a policeman who claims to have the highest level of national conversion is also In his words, ""No one of our police here can convince you that our videos and books here are useless to you."" Later, no one would talk to me.""
On March 13, 2008, he was forced to leave the labor camp. The police said to the leader of Tsinghua University who came to pick him up: ""As with the labor camp, you have to look back!"" ""
Another extremely evil means of the CCP’s persecution of Falun Gong is to ""cut off from the economy."" Anyone who insists on practicing Falun Gong will not be allowed to work in all party and government organs, enterprises and institutions under the control of the CCP, or expel from public office, or dismiss, or not sign a contract, and smash your rice bowl!
After returning to Tsinghua, he immediately faced the problem of being ""economically cut off."" School leaders are required to write a statement that they must admit their mistakes and do not practice. Otherwise, they will not renew their teacher contracts. Do not want to write such a false statement with conscience. Just because I insisted on my own beliefs, this good teacher who was very popular with students eventually had to leave China. On August 27, 2008, a family of three arrived in Chicago, the central city of the United States.
After arriving in the United States, he said in a statement: ""I love my job, I love my students, I love my loved ones. I don't want to leave the Chinese land where I raised me. I don't want to leave my familiarity. The classroom and the expectations of the students. However, when the beliefs and interests contradict each other, I have to demonstrate for my students: I am telling the truth, to expose the persecution of the CCP, to awaken the people who are confused by the CCP’s evil lies, I I can only give up everything I love, leave China, and express my heart to the place where I can tell the truth."" He said: ""I want to tell my students and people all over the world with my personal experience: the common crime.""
Wang Weiyu is a friend of mine in the first sub-district of Beijing Qianjin Prison. It is also a rare talented student I have ever seen.
In Tsinghua University, Wang Weiyu has excellent sample studies and excellent scholarships, excellent graduate medals, special Chinese scholarship scholarships (for the first time undergraduate students) and Philips scholarships. After graduating from undergraduate in 1996, he was directly excused for doctoral degree because of his excellent performance.
Wang Weiyu was the squad leader, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, the vice chairman of the Department of Science and Technology, the deputy secretary of the Youth League Committee, and the undergraduate student counselor of the 97th grade. Just because of conviction of Falun Gong, practicing Falun Gong, and insisting on telling the truth on the Falun Gong issue, Wang Weiyu’s most precious youthful life in his life, spent eight and a half years, was spent in the illegal imprisonment of the CCP.
On August 12, 2002, Wang Weiyu, who was working in a foreign company, was arrested by the Chinese Communist Party as a ""thief"" on his way out of business. From then on, until the beginning of 2004, Wang Weiyu was ""evaporated"" for more than a year. During the period, Wang Weiyu was detained for more than half a year in Beijing Paradise River, a place that was known as a ""legal training center."" This is a paradise surrounded by high-wall power grids, armed police guarded 24 hours a day, and practicing the physical and mental torture of Falun Gong practitioners!
Wang Weiyu experienced the most unforgettable torture in his life. He recalled: ""I experienced an electric shock for one night. All parts of the body were all over. All ten fingers were charged. They put the electric baton on my neck until it was discharged. Finally, it was too late. Charging, plug directly into the socket of 220 volts, the full house of electricity is the burnt smell of the skin, until the electricity faints!""
Then, Wang Weiyu was sentenced to 8 years in prison and was escorted to Beijing Qianjin Prison. This is a human devil who specializes in imprisoning Beijing-based Falun Gong practitioners. Wang Weiyu has also suffered various tortures here and his body and mind have been severely devastated. When the wind was released, his right leg Achilles was kicked, the forefoot could not touch the ground, dragged for three and a half months, the prison did not arrange any inspection and treatment, not only that, but also forced him to complete all the physical labor every day!
The CCP’s cruel persecution of the genius student Wang Weiyu made Wang Weiyu’s family completely desperate for the CCP. Finally, the family fled China.
In 2013, Wang Weiyu fled China and reunited with his family. As soon as he arrived in the United States, Wang Weiyu immediately invested in the cultivation of Falun Gong. As long as you have time, you will continue to learn the Fa, practice, and actively participate in Falun.
His various activities, his body quickly returned to health. As a guest, Wang Weiyu participated in the ""Speech Life - The Life Experience of Doctoral Students at Tsinghua University"" (upper, middle and lower), which was filmed by NTDTV. The links are as follows:

[Spoken Life] Life Experience of Doctoral Students at Tsinghua University (Part 1)


[Speech life] Life experience of doctoral students at Tsinghua University (middle)


[Speech life] Life experience of doctoral students at Tsinghua University (below)

Now, Wang Weiyu works for a Fortune 500 company in the United States. In mainland China, he was forced to be separated from him by his wife for eight and a half years, reunited with him in the United States. Now they have a lively and lovely son. In the past 20 years, Wang Weiyu, who suffered from the hardships, has undergone many changes. Only one remains unchanged, that is, insisting on practicing Falun Gong!
Without this evil persecution, Wang Weiyu may become an excellent scientist, and he may become an educator in the world. If there is no such evil persecution, how many weights will emerge in the group of practicing Falun Gong in China. Deliang's outstanding talents? However, the CCP has persecuted them in the most evil way!
After the 1981 difficulties, these best Chinese children came to overseas countries with freedom of belief. They regarded Falun Gong as the most important treasure in their lives, strengthened their practice, revived the vitality of life, and recasted their lives. Brilliance.
In other words, in mainland China, it has shared 20 years of time, spending a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, forcing them to give up their faith, and in the end, all in vain. What is particularly sad is that the CCP continues to waste a lot of manpower, material resources and financial resources to persecute Falun Gong.
Is there a more evil and stupid party than the CCP?
The greatness of Falun Gong is reflected in many aspects. For example, in ancient China, people have reawakened people's beliefs and awes about God; for example, their miraculous effects on pursuing their bodies and minds, people from all walks of life who transcend national borders, parties, races, gender, age, occupation, language, cultural background, and religious beliefs. From the heart of the respect.
In particular, it is necessary to point out that, contrary to the CCP’s suppression of Falun Gong’s forced orders, Falun Gong has been passed down to the world and has never engaged in any forced orders.
Master Li Hongzhi repeatedly stressed in ""Zhuan Falun"": ""No one can force you to repair, it is equal to doing bad things. Who can force you to change your heart?""
On November 1st, I published ""Xi Jinping's Final Choice in Good and Evil"" in the Epoch Times. I wrote: ""Ending the persecution of Falun Gong, arresting Jiang Zemin, and disintegrating the Chinese Communist Party are things that God had arranged long ago many years ago. No one can stop it.""
""If you don't want to be the second of Ceausescu, Xi Jinping really has to calm down and think about it.""
The parties in the two cases mentioned in this article are Xi Jinping's Tsinghua alumni. I hope that Xi Jinping can take a serious look and think about it.
