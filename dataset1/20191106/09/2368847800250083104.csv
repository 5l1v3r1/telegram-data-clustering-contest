見證中共歷次危機 揭密京西賓館發生的大事

06 Nov 2019, 09:32

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒在中共四中全會期間離奇死亡、地點是四中全會召開的京西賓館。戒備森嚴的京西賓館再次引發輿論關注，該處是中共高層會議主要召開之地，同時也見證了中共歷次危機。
從天安門沿著長安街一路向西，羊坊店路和復興路的交叉口，有一座掛著「羊坊店路1號」的大院，門口總有兩組持槍的衛兵相對而立。在路邊一排高大的樹木掩映下的藍色琉璃圍牆內的建築，這就是京西賓館。
京西賓館被視為北京的「政治地標」之一，為期四天的中共十九屆四中全會就是在此召開。
《Vista看天下》曾刊發題為「京西賓館，最低調的政治地標」一文稱，京西賓館最具特色的是會場倒水、續水、送毛巾服務。女服務員列隊進入會場，步調一致、速度相同、整體移動、操作輕盈，讓人嘆為觀止。
陸媒也曾刊文稱，中共的重要會議多在京西賓館召開，包括中共十一屆三中全會、十三屆四中全會、十六屆六中七中全會、十八屆三中全會、十八屆四中全會等。

文章還羅列了京西賓館了有「五最」：

一，最難進，只有憑會議組織單位核發的會議通知、請柬、會議證等有效證件才可以進入，身分證、工作證、記者證等等都不管用。
二，最安全「從未發生一起泄密事件」。
三，會議最多，每年至少接待200場次以上的會議，幾乎天天有會。
四，規格高，1989年以來，京西賓館是中共最高規格的會場之一，十一屆三中全會等重要會議都在此舉行。
五，最「神祕」，近年來釣魚台國賓館、北京大會堂等中共黨政領導人重要會議舉辦地，都已對外開放，可京西賓館仍未對外開放。

然而，就是這樣實行軍事化管理，由中共軍隊直接控制，「最安全」、「最難進」、「從未發生一起泄密事件」的賓館，卻在中共第十九屆四中全會後，曝出中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒在此離奇墜亡事件。
在此之前，還曝出中共前中辦主任令計劃，利用京西賓館監控中共高層的醜聞。
據披露，令計劃是江澤民集團發動政變的重要人物、京西賓館的原總經理劉存水是令計劃的死黨，令計劃通過劉存水對參加京西賓館會議代表進行監聽，掌握了許多省部級以上高官隱私和愛好。
中共十八大前夕，令計劃讓中南海電話局給劉存水辦公室安裝了一部紅機電話。令計劃還親自給上海市委打電話，要求上海市委協調上海財政，贊助京西賓館1億人民幣對東樓、西樓進行了裝修改造。

京西賓館見證中共歷次危機

1967年1月19日，中共軍委擴大的碰頭會上，葉劍英、徐向前、聶榮臻等中共軍隊高層為了保護軍隊高幹，在此和中共文革小組「拍了桌子」激烈爭論。這是著名的「大鬧京西賓館事件」。
1979年，包括林彪、江青集團的審判工作會議在這裡召開，中共十一屆三中全會也在此召開。
文革結束後，京西賓館成為一系列重大決策部署的「誕生地」。
1989年，中共前總書記胡耀邦去世，引發遍及全國的學運。在中共十三屆四中全會上，時任中共總書記的趙紫陽因不同意屠殺學生，被所謂「政治錯誤」而免去職務。
中共十六屆六中全會上，江澤民與胡錦濤激烈斗時，上海前市委書記陳良宇被正式開除黨籍，這是胡錦濤多次被暗殺後，開始奪軍權，並打掉了江澤民選中的中共接班人。
在2012年的中共十七屆七中全會，前重慶市委書記薄熙來、劉志軍被開除黨籍。這是薄周密謀政變計劃曝光後，胡錦濤和習近平聯盟，打掉江澤民選中的另一中共接班人。
2012年5月初，200名中共高官參加了京西賓館的會議上，胡錦濤定下方針，周永康形同「裸退」交出權力，失去指定政法委接班人的權力，周於2013年12月被祕密調查。
2013年11月，十八屆三中全會在京西賓館舉行，會議在爭吵中落幕，當局通過了成立兩大權力機構「國家安全委員會」和「深化改革領導小組」的決定，破除胡溫時代中共常委「九龍治水」的局面。
2014年10月，十八屆四中全會在京西賓館召開前，周永康被立案調查。
2017年10月，中共十八屆七中全會在京西賓館召開，為同月召開的十九大做準備，十九大後新一屆中央委員會中，有多達70%委員是新委任的，是1969年文革後中共撤換委員人數中最多的一次。
