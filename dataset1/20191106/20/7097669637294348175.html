      <h1>Gordon Ramsey Drives Dozens Of His Insane Cars On Track</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:04:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motorious.com/" target="_blank">Amie Williams</a></address>
      <h4>This includes his rare McLaren Senna,</h4>
      <p>Gordon Ramsey is one of the biggest celebrity chef's in existence and is a household name spoken in living rooms across the world. Sure, the British chef is known for his no-filter lashings toward contestants on <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> and for his five-star restaurants found in major cities, but he is also a well-known car guy with quite the collection.</p>
      <p>For a day full of fun with family and friends, Ramsey heads to the Brands Hatch racetrack with a dozen of his cars in tow. Apparently these are just his U.K.-based cars, meaning that he likely has an even larger collection of cars elsewhere. Among the worthy is a <a href="https://www.mclarenchat.com/forum/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">McLaren</a> Senna, Porsche 918 Spyder, and a <a href="https://ferrarichat.com/forum/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">Ferrari La Ferrari</a> Aperta. Ramsey seems to be blown away by the fact of seeing all his cars from the United Kingdom on track together for the first time.</p>

      <p>One of the cars Ramsey brought out was certainly born for this kind of adventure, but it is a rare <a href="https://www.mclarenchat.com/forum/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">McLaren</a> with just 500 ever produced. We are talking about the <a href="https://www.mclarenchat.com/forum/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">McLaren Senna</a>. Ramsey compares it to "driving the fastest roller coaster you've ever been on." Another one of his cars is a <a href="https://ferrarichat.com/forum/?utm_source=motorious.com&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=motorious">Ferrari F355</a> slathered in bright yellow, and we also seem him pilot a blue <a href="https://www.motorious.com/vehicles/111401/2015-porsche-918-spyder">Porsche 918 Sypder</a>. The Spyder is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 seconds in the low two-second range. Another car is the <a href="https://www.motorious.com/vehicles/1088/2015-ferrari-laferrari-2dr-cpe">LaFerrari</a> Aperta supercar, and only 200 of these cars were ever made. In fact, it looks like the chef is the proud owner of two of these rare beauties.</p>

      <p>While there are certainly cons to being famous like being hassled everywhere you go, there certainly are plenty of perks.
