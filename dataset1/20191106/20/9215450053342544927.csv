長江生命科技發表公告，指旗下全資附屬公司Polynoma LLC，將發表黑色素瘤抗原疫苗免疫療法中，候選疫苗seviprotimut-L的第三階段臨床研究數據。長江生命科技表示研究數據「令人鼓舞」，seviprotimut-L可能是黑色素瘤疫苗療法的一項重要革新，而市場目前尚未有任何疫苗獲准用於黑色素瘤輔助性療法。長江生命科技指出，黑色素瘤療法的環球市場估值超過10億美元，預計未來能以倍數增長。

長江生命科技未升完
信誠證券聯席董事張智威表示，以現價0.9元計算，市賬率約2倍、市盈率約33倍，在容易受消息帶動的生物科技股來說股價合理。而今天以貼近全日高位0.9元收市，反映目前長江生命科技股價未完全消化好消息，認為尚有約10%的上行空間，目標價1元，跌穿0.8元則應先行止賺離場。
值得留意的是，長江生命科技在收市前半小時錄得141.81億成交，在競價時段錄得2,025萬股大手買賣，投資者應注意相關股票在未來有機會大幅波動。
