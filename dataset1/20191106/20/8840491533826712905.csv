06 Nov 2019, 20:21

THE shortlist for the An Post Irish Book Awards 2019 features Mayo native Dr. Norah Patten for her book, Shooting for the Stars – My Journey to Become Ireland’s First Astronaut.
The An Post Irish Book Awards consist of a diverse mix of exceptional writing from new and established writers across 16 categories, including Novel of the Year, Children’s, Cookery, Crime Fiction, Popular Fiction, Non-Fiction, Sports, Short Story, Poetry, Teen and Young Adult and Irish Language.
Norah's book is shortlisted in the Specsavers Children’s Book of the Year (Senior) category.
In the book Norah tells us about herself, all about space and the life of an astronaut as we follow her on a journey high above the earth. Learn about the wonders of space travel, astronaut training and life without gravity.
This is a fun and fascinating book about following your dreams.
The awards celebrate and promote Irish writing to the widest range of readers possible, bringing together a huge community passionate about books – readers, authors, booksellers, publishers and librarians – to recognise the very best of Irish writing talent.
Following its hugely successful first year sponsoring the awards in 2018, An Post has launched its latest #ReadersWanted campaign, celebrating the value and joy of reading and encouraging everyone to pick up more books, more often.
