      <p>California is investigating Facebook’s disclosure of user data to Cambridge Analytica, it emerged in a court filing demanding the firm respond to a subpoena.</p>
      <p>Facebook is already being investigated by 47 states in the US. Some have raised concerns that Facebook and other tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices, expose consumer data to thieves and inflate advertising prices.</p>

      <p>Facebook was not immediately available for comment.</p>
      <p>Investigators working for California’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6541273-California-v-Facebook.html">asked the court to force Facebook to hand over information</a> about how much access developers and other third parties had to data and changes in privacy settings.</p>
      <p>The document said the 17 June subpoena followed Facebook’s initial responses and later news reports “concerning other claims of wrongdoing by Facebook over users’ privacy”. </p>
      <p>“Facebook’s responses to this second subpoena and set of interrogatories is patently deficient,” it said.</p>
      <p>In particular, the attorney general’s office pointed to a failure to look at communications of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
      <p>“Facebook has not searched the email of the company’s chief executive and chief operating officers for documents responsive to the subpoena,” it said.</p>
      <p>Separate <a href="https://www.cityam.com/facebook-executives-planned-switcharoo-on-data-policy-change/">court documents have indicated the company started cutting off developers’ access to user data from 2012</a>, in a bid to squash potential rivals.</p>

      <p>The move was sold to the public as a boost to user privacy, in what became known to executives as the Switcharoo Plan.</p>
      <p>The emergence of nearly 7,000 pages of company emails and executive documents comes as Facebook faces multiple investigations into possible antitrust violations by regulators around the world.</p>
