      <h2>Under-pressure Arsenal manager Unai Emery saw his struggling side let a lead slip for the fourth game in a row as they were pegged back by Vitoria</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:07:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Martin Keown believes there are "problems all over the pitch" for Unai Emery after the Gunners let a lead slip for the fourth game in a row.</p>
      <p>Another poor performance saw <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> lucky to leave Vitoria with a 1-1 draw as Shkodran Mustafi's header was cancelled out by an injury-time bicycle kick from Bruno Duarte.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth time in 10 days that Arsenal have failed to hold onto a lead and Mustafi's 80th-minute effort was their first shot on target in a game where they toiled in the Portuguese rain.</p>
      <p>And Keown has laid into Emery, believing the manager got his tactics wrong on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Keown told BT Sport: "There are problems all over the pitch. It can quickly be turned around. If I was involved in the weekend I'd go on the attack because we can't defend.</p>
      <p>"We are in danger of losing some of the identity of the team built under Arsene Wenger. We cannot defend and have lost that attacking flavour.</p>
      <p>"I think it's a personal thing of how you mark up in set-pieces. There are huge gaps. All they did was put a ball in and run through the hole. they could put a double decker bus through that! It's too simple.</p>

      <p>"It's basic decision-making and they need to change."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Emery remained defiant when asked about the possibility of being replaced by Jose Mourinho after seeing his Arsenal side struggle to earn a point in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>The spectre of former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho has started to hang over Emery as reports continue to link the Portuguese to the Arsenal hot-seat.</p>

      <p>The Gunners denied suggestions over the weekend that Mourinho had dined with Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi as pressure continues to build on Emery.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's presence in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago ramped up the theories that he was a potential replacement should Emery lose his job.</p>
      <p>Asked about the Mourinho links and the fan criticism aimed at him following recent performances, Emery simply replied: "I am the coach."</p>
