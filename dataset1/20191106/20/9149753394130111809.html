      <h1>Rockstar is offering cash rewards for finding Red Dead Online security flaws</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:21:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>Have you ever been improperly banned from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-online/">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> for "false positive" cheating, even though absolutely no cheating actually took place? Well here's the fact, Jack: Rockstar doesn't believe you. It doesn't believe you so much that if you can prove it—more precisely, if you can "successfully identify a reproducible incorrect ban in Grand Theft Auto Online"—it'll give you $10,000.</p>
      <p>The bounty, offered through the <a href="https://hackerone.com/rockstargames">HackerOne website</a>, was actually first offered a year ago as part of a "bug bounty" program that's been running since 2016. But yesterday, with the launch of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-release-date/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> on PC, Rockstar expanded the program to encompass a wider range of games and vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>"To date, the private program has been a targeted bounty campaign to root out a very specific type of potential vulnerability in Grand Theft Auto Online," Rockstar said in the <a href="https://hackerone.com/rockstargames/updates">update</a>. "However, we are happy to announce that beginning today, we will now be accepting a wider variety of vulnerability reports for in-scope vulnerability categories."</p>
      <p>Rockstar is now taking reports from the following games:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Grand Theft Auto 5 and Grand Theft Auto Online on the following platforms:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PS4</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
        <li>PC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online on the following platforms:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PS4</li>
        <li>Xbox One</li>
        <li>PC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Mobile apps:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2 Companion App</li>
        <li>iFruit Mobile App</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's not as simple as posting a message in a forum, though. If you want to qualify for rewards you'll need to enroll in Rockstar's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU2Wtngvy38YcYBweTt7HjE0ST1t_Slv4QMcn4zk-wpQjosA/viewform">private bounty program</a>, and you'll also have to follow some fairly strict rules about what to report, and how to report it. And if you happen to earn yourself a ban while "testing for issues," that's tough noogies for you—it won't be reversed.</p>
      <p>The minimum bounty for discovered vulnerabilities is $150, but it goes up from there based on "the severity and complexity of the identified potential vulnerability." Researcher Mario Gomes, who tops Rockstar's "<a href="https://hackerone.com/rockstargames/thanks">thanks</a>" list, has claimed rewards ranging from $250 to $1000 over the past year.</p>
      <p>Rockstar's bug bounty program is essentially the same as one offered by Valve that we learned about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-is-paying-hackers-up-to-dollar3000-to-discover-steam-security-flaws/">last year</a>, when it also went from private to public. At that time, Valve had paid out $109,000 to people who had discovered security flaws in Steam and games like CSGO, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2; that amount is now up to more than <a href="https://hackerone.com/valve?view_policy=true">$840,000</a>.</p>
      <p>And in case you were wondering, yes: Rockstar confirmed that it is still offering ten large in its Incorrect Ban Bounty campaign. Good luck.</p>
