Sales in the company's pharmacy services unit increased 6.4per cent to US$36.02 billion in the third quarter, helped by a rise in prices of branded drugs and increased claims.
The company, which also runs drugstores, closed its US$69 billion purchase of Aetna in November 2018.
Sales in its health care benefits business, which houses Aetna, soared to US$17.18 billion, helped by lower-than-expected medical costs. The unit reported a medical benefit ratio of 83.3per cent, compared with estimates of 84.3per cent according to four analysts polled by Refinitiv.
CVS Health's net profit rose 10.1per cent to US$1.53 billion, or US$1.17 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
Excluding items, the company earned US$1.84 per share, above analysts' estimates of US$1.77.
Revenue jumped 36.5per cent to US$64.81 billion.
