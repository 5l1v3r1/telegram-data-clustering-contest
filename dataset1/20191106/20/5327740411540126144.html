      <p>Scammeres are spoofing phone numbers from federal agencies to defraud Canadians, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.</p>
      <p>The centre, which itself has had its number spoofed, said the calls appear to come from a legitimate phone number or police detachment.</p>
      <p>The scammers have targeted the Courts Administration Service, the Canadian Revenue Agency, the Department of Justice Canada and more.</p>
      <p>Anyone who receives a scam call is asked to report it to the anti-fraud centre by going to <a href="http://www.antifraudcentre.ca/">www.antifraudcentre.ca</a>.</p>
      <p>The centre is reminding people to not hand over personal or financial information to callers.</p>
