06 Nov 2019, 20:30 by Tim Burke



UFC 244 featured a bevy of violence in the cage, and the medical suspensions issued by the New York State Athletic Commission reflected that to a degree. While most commissions will issue 180-day terms for fighters that suffer major injuries, New York limits them to 90. And five fighters were issued 90 day terms, including headliner Nate Diaz and main card fighter Gregor Gillespie.
