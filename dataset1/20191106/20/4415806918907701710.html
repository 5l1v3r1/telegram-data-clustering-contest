      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:19:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Tom Watson has announced that he is stepping down as deputy leader of the Labour Party in the UK.</p>
      <p>In a shock announcement, Mr Watson said that he would not be seeking re-election as an MP in the forthcoming British General Election.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, he said that the time had come to “start a different kind of life”.</p>
      <p>“The decision is personal, not political,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The last few years have been among the most transformational of my personal life, second only to becoming a proud father of two beautiful children.</p>
      <p>“I’ve become healthy for the first time and I intend to continue with this work in the years to come.”</p>
