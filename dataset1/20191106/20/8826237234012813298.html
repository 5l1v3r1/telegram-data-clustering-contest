      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:45:40+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">JILL COLVIN / AP</a></address>
      <p>(WASHINGTON) — The White House is beefing up its communications staff as it tries to grapple with the ongoing House impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>A senior administration official tells The Associated Press that Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, are expected to join the White House communications team to work on “proactive impeachment messaging” and other special projects.</p>
      <p>The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal staffing, stressed their jobs will be temporary.</p>
      <p>Outside allies of the president and some inside the White House have been pushing for a more coordinated response to the quickly-unfolding impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>The move comes the same day as House Democrats announced they will hold the first public impeachment hearings next week.</p>
