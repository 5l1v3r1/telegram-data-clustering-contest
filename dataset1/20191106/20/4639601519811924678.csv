Dendias elaborated on Greece’s diplomatic outlook and said that «given the consistent stance of Greek foreign policy that Russia is part of the European security framework, Greece can prove particularly useful to Russia, if the latter wishes, in building the necessary understanding, resolving existing differences, comprehending the measures needed towards a normalisation where necessary, and in overcoming problems and friction by eliminating their causes,” he underlined.

Lavrov’s remarks

For his part, Lavrov said that «our relations are defined by a centuries-long history and are characterised by mutual sympathy.»

Mutual invitations

«2021 will mark the bicentenary of the Greek War of Independence, which gave rise to the independent Modern Greek state, an event to which our country contributed in every possible way,» added Lavrov and revealed that with his Greek counterpart «we discussed possible joint events in the context of this anniversary.»
Dendias noted that Greece will soon send an invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin to participate in these commemorative events.
Lavrov also conveyed Putin’s invitation to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to attend the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II that will be held in Russia in 2020.
Another issue discussed was the recognition of the independence (autocephaly) of Ukraine’s Orthodox Church.
Both ministers agreed that it isn’t an issue that affects or might affect Greek-Russian relations, while both stressed the independence of state and church. In addition, Lavrov said the issue arose through the influence of the US, which he said tried to drive a wedge in the Orthodox world.
