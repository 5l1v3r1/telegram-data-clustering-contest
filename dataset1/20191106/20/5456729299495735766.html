      <p>The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Shuaibu Ibrahim, has warned corps members against defacing the NYSC uniform.</p>
      <p>Mr Ibrahim, in a statement issued on Wednesday in Umuahia, gave the warning when he paid an unscheduled visit to the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, in Umunna.</p>
      <p>According to the statement signed by Omaka Nnachi, the Public Relations Officer of NYSC, Abia, the D-G warned that severe punishment would be meted out to anyone who defaced the uniform.</p>
      <p>Addressing the prospective corps members during their registration, the NYSC boss said: “Our uniform is our brand. As such, you must dress properly.’’</p>
      <p>Mr Ibrahim also cautioned them against embarking on unauthorised journeys, saying, “it is what kills our corps members most. It is not insecurity but death as a result of road traffic accidents.’’</p>
      <p>“If you want to travel within Nigeria, it is only the state coordinator that can permit you. If you apply and it’s not granted, stay put.</p>
      <p>“If you want to travel outside the country, it is only the D-G that can approve your journey, if not granted, don’t move an inch.</p>
      <p>The army general, who went round the camp for inspection, commended the state coordinator, Bona Fasakin, for bringing newness to the camp kitchen. (NAN)</p>
