中共發動新一輪信息戰 大量五毛註冊海外社媒抹黑香港

06 Nov 2019, 20:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】中共一邊嚴控大陸民眾上推特（Twitter）、臉書（Facebook）及油管（YouTube），一邊卻出動國家力量在這些海外社交媒體上，大舉發動針對香港「反送中」抗議活動的輿論攻勢。繼8月數十萬來自中國的虛假社交帳號被封號或刪除後，日前有多家網絡安全分析公司發現，針對香港抗議運動進行虛假宣傳的輿論戰並未停止，大量「五毛」疑似註冊了新帳戶繼續誣衊港人，其發帖模式與被禁帳戶如出一轍。
據香港《蘋果日報》報導，監視社交網操縱行為的分析公司Astroscreen，在針對3萬個Twitter反「反送中」運動的帳戶進行分析後發現，有三分之一的帳號是在8至10月間開設的。Astroscreen還指出，這些新帳戶都緊跟中共的說辭，稱示威有「外國干預」，並使用通用的標籤（如#HongKongProtest或#HongKong）來避開Twitter檢查。
Astroscreen認為，這是8月被禁的帳戶以另一形式「翻生」。
該公司負責人巴羅佳（Donara Barojan）透露，新開設的帳戶都有相同的模式，包括以一般照片當頭像、不提供任何身份信息，不少帳戶的追隨者少於10人，而且主要發布針對香港示威的英文帖文，旨在抹黑示威活動，「這會帶來錯誤的共識」。
Astroscreen表示，上述提及的帳戶中，目前至少有2個已經被移除。
網絡安全公司Nisos及FireEye（火眼）亦有類似的發現。
美國網路安全公司FireEye自6月起追蹤多個平台的假訊息行動。該公司資深董事福斯特（Lee Foster）表示，在社交平台8月移除帳戶後，很快就發現有同類新帳戶出現，而且形式與被禁的帳戶幾乎一模一樣。這顯示散布訊息的幕後人士並沒有收手。
Nisos分析總監、前中情局官員奧蒂斯（Cindy Otis）認為，創建新帳戶是「低成本、低風險」的方法，「他們沒有理由不再嘗試」。她還指出，這些新帳戶多數會轉載帖文或複製訊息，同時利用改圖將示威者描繪成「暴徒」。
今年8月19日，臉書率先表示，移除了7個頁面、3個群組和5個帳號，包括將香港抗議者描述成蟑螂和恐怖份子的內容和帳號。這些帳號被指涉及散播關於香港的假新聞。其中有頁面有近1萬5000名粉絲，另有一個群組有2200個成員。
次日（8月20日），推特公司表示，已暫停超過20萬個帳號，這些帳號涉及幫助中共針對香港抗議運動進行虛假宣傳。一名推特高管表示，這項措施旨在遏制散播惡意政治活動的訊息，並已經向FBI報告了此次中國（中共）的行為（Chinese acitivities）。
繼推特和臉書之後，8月22日，Alphabet公司旗下的谷歌亦宣布，關閉210個YouTube頻道，作為該公司反擊親中共團體的努力的一部份，這些團體試圖破壞香港近期的民主抗議活動。
而9月20日，推特公司官方帳號「推特安全」（twitter safety）發布聲明，再次向公眾披露了一批「違反推特價值觀和平台操作政策」的帳號，共10,112個，並以「背後有國家操縱」為由，將其永久關停（permanently suspended），其中僅中國（包括香港）帳號就高達4,301個。
推特指控，這些中國帳號「在香港的示威運動中挑撥製造不和」。

The CCP launches a new round of information warfare. A large number of Wumao registered overseas media to discredit Hong Kong.

06 Nov 2019, 20:38

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] The CCP is strictly controlling the mainland people to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, while mobilizing the national power to launch on these overseas social media. A public opinion campaign against Hong Kong's ""reverse delivery"" protests. After hundreds of thousands of fake social accounts from China were sealed or deleted in August, a number of cybersecurity analysis companies found that the public opinion campaign against the Hong Kong protest movement did not stop. A large number of ""five hairs"" suspected of registering new ones. The account continues to be a Hong Kong resident, and its posting mode is exactly the same as the banned account.
According to Hong Kong's ""Apple Daily"" report, Astroscreen, an analysis company that monitors the manipulation of social networks, analyzed an account against 30,000 Twitter anti-delivery campaigns and found that one-third of accounts were between 8 and 10. Opened during the month. Astroscreen also pointed out that these new accounts are closely following the CCP's rhetoric, saying that the demonstrations have ""foreign intervention"" and use universal labels (such as #HongKongProtest or #HongKong) to avoid Twitter checks.
Astroscreen believes that this is an account that was banned in August and ""turned over"" in another form.
The head of the company, Donara Barojan, revealed that the newly opened accounts all have the same model, including the general picture as an avatar, no identity information, many account followers of less than 10 people, and mainly released The English post for Hong Kong demonstrations is aimed at discrediting demonstrations. ""This will lead to a wrong consensus.""
Astroscreen said that at least 2 of the accounts mentioned above have been removed.
Network security companies Nisos and FireEye (Fire Eye) have similar findings.
US Internet security company FireEye has been tracking fake messages from multiple platforms since June. Lee Foster, a senior director of the company, said that after the social platform removed the account in August, it quickly found a similar new account, and the form was almost exactly the same as the banned account. This shows that the people behind the scenes have not stopped.
Cindy Otis, Nisos's director of analysis and former CIA official, believes that creating new accounts is a ""low-cost, low-risk"" approach. ""They have no reason not to try again."" She also pointed out that most of these new accounts would repost posts or copy messages, and use the map to portray the demonstrators as ""thugs.""
On August 19 this year, Facebook first stated that it removed 7 pages, 3 groups and 5 accounts, including content and accounts that described Hong Kong protesters as defamatory and terrorists. These accounts are alleged to involve the dissemination of fake news about Hong Kong. Among them, there are nearly 15,000 fans on the page, and another group has 2,200 members.
The next day (August 20th), Twitter said it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts, which are related to helping the CCP to make false propaganda against the Hong Kong protest movement. A Twitter executive said the measure was designed to curb the spread of malicious political activity and has reported the Chinese acitivities to the FBI.
Following Twitter and Facebook, on August 22, Alphabet's Google also announced the closure of 210 YouTube channels as part of the company's efforts to counter the pro-China group, which attempted to undermine recent democratic protests in Hong Kong. activity.
On September 20th, Twitter official account ""twitter safety"" issued a statement, once again disclosed to the public a number of ""violation of Twitter values and platform operating policies"" account number, a total of 10,112, and "" There is a state manipulation behind it, and it is permanently suspended, with only 4,301 accounts in China (including Hong Kong).
Twitter accused the Chinese accounts of ""promoting mismanagement in the demonstrations in Hong Kong.""
