      <p>AMMAN: Five people, including three tourists, were wounded in a knife attack in Jordan on Wednesday (Nov 6), a security spokesman said, adding that the assailant had been apprehended.</p>
      <p>"Around noon, a man attacked tourists, a tour guide and a security officer who tried to stop him in Jerash", a popular attraction 50km from the capital Amman, a spokesman for the public security directorate said in a statement.</p>

      <p>"The wounded were transported to hospital for treatment" and "the assailant was immediately arrested", he added.</p>
      <p>He did not specify the nationality of the attacker or of those wounded, nor give details on the severity of their injuries.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time tourist sites have been targeted by attacks in Jordan.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, at Karak, home to one of the region's biggest Crusader castles, 10 people were killed in an attack that also left 30 wounded.</p>
      <p>The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group (IS). Ten people were ultimately sentenced for carrying out the attack.</p>
      <p>The Roman ruins at Jerash are one of Jordan's main tourist draws after the ancient desert city of Petra.</p>
      <p>Tourism is a mainstay of the Jordanian economy.</p>
