The campaign began in Britain
06 Nov 2019, 20:35 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad

The British Parliament was dissolved ahead of a general election on December 12, when the country's political parties officially launched the campaign.

Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants a speedy vote to end the country's withdrawal from the European Union.
According to Johnson, this peak of more than three years has crippled the UK and is beginning to affect the country's fifth-largest economy.
Mr. Johnson met Queen Elizabeth ahead of the launch of his campaign, while Wales Minister Alun Cairns resigned after being accused of misrepresenting a rape case.
The Conservative Party fared well in the wake of the campaign, defeating its largest rival, the Labor Party by 7-17.
But conservatives warn that Conservative favor is declining due to Brexit.
Mr. Johnson is still trying to convince the people of his country to get support for their exit from the European Union, while he says that Labor leader Jeremy corbyrn will create a barrier for them on their way out.
