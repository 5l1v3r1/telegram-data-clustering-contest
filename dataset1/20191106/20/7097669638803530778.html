      <p>Washington (AFP) - Two men arrested last year for spying on Iranian dissidents in the United States have pleaded guilty to charges in a Washington court, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Iranian-US dual citizen Ahmadreza Mohammadi Doostdar and Majid Ghorbani, an Iranian resident of California, tried to penetrate the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), a group of Iranian dissidents in exile, in New York and Washington from 2017-2018, according to the department.</p>
      <p>Doostdar traveled to the United States form Iran on three occasions to recruit Ghorbani and give him instructions and thousands of dollars in payments, according to the charges.</p>
      <p>Ghorbani attended MEK rallies and events, taking pictures of participants and collecting information for Doostdar.</p>
      <p>Doostdar pleaded guilty to charges of acting as an unregistered agent of the government of Iran, while Ghorbani pleaded guilty to violating US sanctions laws with respect to Iran.</p>
      <p>In announcing their guilty pleas, the Justice Department did not repeat allegations made when the two were arrested that Doostdar had also surveilled Jewish Institutions in Chicago during a 2017 visit.</p>
      <p>Doostdar faces up to 15 years in prison while Ghorbar could be jailed for a maximum 20 years.</p>
      <p>"The Iranian government thought it could get away with conducting surveillance on individuals in the United States by sending one of its agents here to task a permanent resident with conducting and collecting that surveillance," said Jessie Liu, the US attorney for Washington.</p>
      <p>"This case highlights our efforts to pursue those who threaten national security and disrupt foreign governments that target US persons."</p>
