      <p>LeBron James has long embraced the villain role, and that’s exactly what he did during Tuesday’s game against the Bulls at United Center.</p>
      <p>The Bulls trolled James before the game even began, as they had a person dress in a taco costume <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/05/bulls-hilariously-troll-lebron-james-with-dancing-tacos-during-introductions-video/">dance behind the Lakers star</a> during pregame introductions (<a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/05/bulls-hilariously-troll-lebron-james-with-dancing-tacos-during-introductions-video/">watch here</a>), which was pretty funny to watch, and set the tone early.</p>
      <p>Fans fed off that vibe and continued it during the game, with James and teammate Anthony Davis on the bench. A group of Bulls fans began heckling the two Lakers stars, which incited James to troll one of them right back with a one-liner.</p>
      <p>“Your lady embarrassed to be with you!” James yelled.</p>

      <p>It probably would’ve been better for James to not say anything, but that’s just not who he is.</p>
