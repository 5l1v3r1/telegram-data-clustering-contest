      <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has revealed that she’s working on a feature film in a new interview.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/phoebe-waller-bridge-cover-december-2019"><i>US Vogue</i></a>, the <i>Fleabag</i> writer and star offered an insight into what’s next for her following the success of the acclaimed sitcom and <i>Killing Eve</i>, on which she served as showrunner.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Waller-Bridge explained that the idea for her movie appeared like a “bolt out of the blue” shortly after she’d finished writing <i>Fleabag</i>.</p>
      <p>Though she didn’t reveal any plot details, she did say that the project is a collaborative effort with her sister Isobel Waller-Bridge, who’s a composer and worked on the <i>Fleabag</i> soundtrack.</p>

      <p>“I’ve always loved the idea of starting with a sound and working backward,” said Waller-Bridge. “A lot of times, I’ll write something and go to her and say, ‘Can you score it?’ and with this one, she and I have been talking about the score before I’ve even finished the movie.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/phoebe-waller-bridge-reveals-work-bond-25-script-2486307">Phoebe Waller-Bridge had entered the film world to work on the <i>No Time To Die</i> script</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s such an exciting story and it’s just been a thrill to work on,” she said, adding that she would try to “sneak in” some feminist humour to the upcoming James Bond instalment.</p>
      <p>Back in September, Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/phoebe-waller-bridge-reveals-regrets-about-ending-fleabag-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-waved-goodbye-2550890#Df00SkscCeUcyoEq.99">questioned her decision to end<i> Fleabag</i></a> after the show <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/heres-full-list-winners-emmys-2019-2550384">scored an incredible hat-trick at the Emmys.</a></p>
