      <h1>Republican Matt Bevin is officially calling for a recanvass after losing Kentucky gubernatorial election by 5,000 votes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T20:12:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Tim O'Donnell</a></address>
      <p>Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876666/republican-matt-bevin-isnt-conceding-kentuckys-governor-race">said</a> he wouldn't concede the state's gubernatorial election to Democratic challenger Andy Beshear, and his campaign is now officially calling for a recanvass.</p>
      <p>Citing unspecified "reports of irregularities" in the tightly contested election, which saw Beshear emerge victorious by about 5,000 votes, Bevin's campaign released a statement announcing the request Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A recanvass sounds like a fancy word for recount, but <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/163244-what-exactly-is-a-recanvass-its-not-the-same-as-a-recount-but-it-could-really">it's actually a little different</a>. Bevin's campaign is specifically calling for each county in the state to go through the ballots again on their own, while a recount would entail sending everything to the court system so it could be tallied up at once.</p>
      <p>Beshear's campaign has already issued a statement in response to the request. Rather than pushing back against Bevin, they seemed confident that it would only reaffirm their victory.</p>
