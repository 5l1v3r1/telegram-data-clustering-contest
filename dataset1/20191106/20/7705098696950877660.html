      <p>Hulu’s take on the classic Marvel’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/helstrom"><b>Helstrom</b></a> has added another familiar face to the cast, especially for fans of Fox’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/x-men"><b>X-Men</b></a> movies. Via <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/marvel-helstrom-hulu-daniel-cudmore-shannon-chan-kent-good-trouble-freeform-1202779179/">Deadline</a>, Daniel Cudmore will join the cast. Cudemore originally appeared as Peter Rasputin, a.k.a. Colossus, in <b>X2: X-Men United</b> back in 2003. He later reprised the role for its follow-up, <b>X-Men: The Last Stand</b> and <b>X-Men: Days of Future Past</b>.</p>
      <p>Tom Austen, Sydney Lemmon, Elizabeth Marvel, Ariana Guerra, Robert Wisdom, June Carryl and Alain Uy have already been cast in the show. Paul Zbyszewski will serve as both showrunner and executive producer, alongside Marvel TV’s Jeph Loeb.</p>
      <p>The series follows Daimon and Ana Helstrom, a brother and sister who utilize special abilities to track down a serial killer. However, they also happen to be the children of said killer. Cudmore will portray a nurse by the name of Keith Spivey. He works at St. Teresa’s, the institution where Daimon and Ana’s mother, Victoria, has resided for the past two decades.</p>

      <p>This series will feature a non-traditional horror setting. During the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/468961-tom-austen-and-sydney-lemmon-will-headline-hulus-helstrom">cast announcement last month</a>, Loeb talked about how it will all come together.</p>
      <p>“Marvel Television is thrilled to have such an amazing cast that enriches Paul’s fantastic writing,” said Loeb at the time. “The ensemble is the perfect way to bring our audience into our <b>Adventure into Fear</b> franchise causing delicious nightmares of what’s to come!”</p>
      <p><b>Helstrom</b> is currently in production. It will probably premiere on Hulu in 2020.</p>
