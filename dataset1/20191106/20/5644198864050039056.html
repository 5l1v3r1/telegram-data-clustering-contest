      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government is looking at measures to tighten its immigration policy to prevent foreign terrorists from using the country as a transit hub, Home Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Wednesday (Nov 6). </p>
      <p>The minister was responding to reporters who had approached him at the Parliament lobby, asking for comment on a statement by counterterrorism official Ayob Khan. </p>

      <p>Ayob Khan had said at a conference on Tuesday that Malaysia was the "first choice" for terrorists because those coming from Middle Eastern countries and some African nations did not require a visa to enter, <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/05/malaysia-remains-transit-hub-for-terrorists-due-to-visa-free-travel-says-bukit-aman">The Star</a> reported. </p>
      <p>He also said that since 2013, a total of 38 foreign terrorists who had used Malaysia as a transit point had been detained and deported. </p>
      <p>“Currently, most foreigners wishing to enter Malaysia only need to have a passport and if the passport is not considered to originate from countries that have problems, they can easily come in," said Muhyiddin. </p>
      <p>“We only impose the visa for specific reasons, that is the regulation that we have. No matter what, we have to study in terms of this immigration policy,” he added.</p>
