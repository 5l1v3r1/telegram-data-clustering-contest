Republican Matt Bevin is officially calling for a recanvass after losing Kentucky gubernatorial election by 5,000 votes
06 Nov 2019, 20:12 by Tim O'Donnell
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) said he wouldn't concede the state's gubernatorial election to Democratic challenger Andy Beshear, and his campaign is now officially calling for a recanvass.
Citing unspecified ""reports of irregularities"" in the tightly contested election, which saw Beshear emerge victorious by about 5,000 votes, Bevin's campaign released a statement announcing the request Wednesday.
A recanvass sounds like a fancy word for recount, but it's actually a little different. Bevin's campaign is specifically calling for each county in the state to go through the ballots again on their own, while a recount would entail sending everything to the court system so it could be tallied up at once.
Beshear's campaign has already issued a statement in response to the request. Rather than pushing back against Bevin, they seemed confident that it would only reaffirm their victory.
