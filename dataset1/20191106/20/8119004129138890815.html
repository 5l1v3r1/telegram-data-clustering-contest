        <b>M Morshed Khan has criticised the BNP leadership and the way it is being run now after resigning from the party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former foreign minister and BNP vice-chairman laments the way how Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is running the party via video call from exile.</p>
      <p>“A large and popular party like the BNP is being run through Skype! It has become ‘Bangladesh Nationalist Skype Party’. It’s a matter of pain, anger!” he told bdnews24.com on Wednesday after quitting the party on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“I think have nothing to contribute to the party now. My advice for the party will be to install the next generations in its leadership,” he added.</p>
      <p>After the jailing of his mother and party chief Khaleda Zia for corruption in February last year, Senior Vice-Chairman Tarique is running the party from London, where he has been staying for more than a decade with up to life sentence over his head having been convicted of charges ranging from corruption and money laundering to a deadly assassination bid on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
      <p>He often communicates with the leaders of the party in Dhaka via Skype.</p>
      <p>The ruling Awami League had objected to him interviewing candidates before the general election last year since he has been declared a fugitive convict by court.</p>
      <p>In the polls, the BNP nominated Abu Sufian as its candidate for the Chattogram-8 (Chandgaon and Boalkhali) parliamentary seat, which had earlier been won by Morshed.</p>
