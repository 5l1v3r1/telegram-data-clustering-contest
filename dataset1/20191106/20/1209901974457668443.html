      <p>The ‘No Stone Left Alone’ ceremony, hosted by the IODE Stettler Frontenac chapter, was held Nov. 5th.</p>
      <p>Along with the Town of Stettler, William E. Hay Stettler Secondary Campus and Score Projects Inc., the chapter invited the public to attend the special event, which started at 1 p.m. at Lake View Cemetery.</p>
      <p>During the ceremony, a cross was placed on every veteran’s grave.</p>
      <p>Peggy Duncan, an IODE member, first spearheaded the project three years ago.</p>
      <p>The idea for No Stone Left Alone first came when Duncan was visiting her granddaughter, who noticed during a TV show close to Remembrance Day that some people were putting up crosses at a spot on Calgary’s Memorial Drive.</p>
      <p>She asked Duncan why a similar type of event wasn’t held in Stettler.</p>
      <p>That was all the inspiration that Duncan needed to begin to put together the first annual ‘No Stone Left Alone’ ceremony.</p>
      <p>Local dignitaries were also in attendance during the Nov. 5th ceremony, including IODE president Valerie Braiden, Mayor Sean Nolls, County Reeve Larry Clarke and James Klassen who filled in for local MLA Nate Horner.</p>
