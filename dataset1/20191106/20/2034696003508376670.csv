Waller-Bridge explained that the idea for her movie appeared like a “bolt out of the blue” shortly after she’d finished writing Fleabag.
Though she didn’t reveal any plot details, she did say that the project is a collaborative effort with her sister Isobel Waller-Bridge, who’s a composer and worked on the Fleabag soundtrack.

“I’ve always loved the idea of starting with a sound and working backward,” said Waller-Bridge. “A lot of times, I’ll write something and go to her and say, ‘Can you score it?’ and with this one, she and I have been talking about the score before I’ve even finished the movie.”
Earlier this year, it was confirmed that Phoebe Waller-Bridge had entered the film world to work on the No Time To Die script.
“It’s such an exciting story and it’s just been a thrill to work on,” she said, adding that she would try to “sneak in” some feminist humour to the upcoming James Bond instalment.
Back in September, Waller-Bridge questioned her decision to end Fleabag after the show scored an incredible hat-trick at the Emmys.
