      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - There is no reason for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to leave office before her planned departure in 2021, her protegee and would-be successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said as they both face criticism from fellow Christian Democrats.</p>
      <p>Party veteran Friedrich Merz ripped into Merkel after the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) slumped in a state vote last month. He said it was “simply not on” for the ruling coalition to carry on as it is until national elections due in 2021.</p>
      <p>Merz, an erstwhile Merkel rival, narrowly lost to Kramp-Karrenbauer in a contest for the CDU leadership last December, when Merkel stepped aside to allow her protegee to boost her profile before 2021.</p>
      <p>But Kramp-Karrenbauer told the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung it was clear “that with my application for the party chair, I reckoned that the chancellor would see this legislative period through to the end”.</p>
      <p>“There is no reason to change anything there,” she added in an early release of an interview to run in the newspaper’s Thursday edition.</p>
      <p>After a series of gaffes and regional election setbacks this year, doubts are growing in the CDU about whether Kramp-Karrenbauer is the right person to succeed Merkel as chancellor.</p>
