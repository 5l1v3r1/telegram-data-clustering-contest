      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shia-labeouf-ptsd-disney-honey-boy">Shia LaBeouf</a> will do anything to raise money for charity.</p>
      <p>During a recent visit to "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">The Ellen DeGeneres</a>" show, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/ellen-degeneres">the talk show host</a> challenged LaBeouf to eat a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhut_jolokia">ghost pepper</a>, known for being one of the spiciest foods on Earth.</p>
      <p>"I want to give you $10,000 for a charity of your choice," DeGeneres, 61 said. "But I understand you like spicey things?"</p>

      <p>LaBeouf confirmed that he enjoys spicy foods as the pepper was brought to him.</p>
      <p>"There's water here, what else can we help you with if this pepper's really, really bad?" DeGeneres asked.</p>
      <p>"That pepper's gone," LaBeouf said. "Say 'bye-bye pepper.' He's out of here. Bye-bye pepper."</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, the actor, 33, chomped down on the pepper.</p>
      <p>"That's a cute little pepper right there," LaBeouf said. "It's a cutie pie. It'll take a minute to kick in probably."</p>
      <p>"Be careful, I don't want to throw up on your knee right there," LaBeouf joked, placing a tray in his lap just in case.</p>

      <p>While the pepper may not have affected LaBeouf, the actor revealed to DeGeneres that his recent arrest and "head camp" did, inspiring him to write the autobiographical film "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">Honey Boy</a>."</p>
      <p>LaBeouf said he wrote "the first chunk [of the film] in this head camp they sent me to" before reuniting with his father after seven years apart and finishing the script.</p>
      <p>"When I got home, I hadn't seen my dad in seven years and my director, Alma Har'el, who's a wizard, she was like, 'You need to go see your dad,'" LaBeouf said. "So I went and saw my dad, recorded that, came home and I had the ending, wrestled it down and that was the process."</p>
      <p>When asked by DeGeneres what "head camp" was, LaBeouf explained: "Head camp is where the court sends you when the other option is seven years in jail, pretty much. I got arrested in Georgia for terrorizing a police officer, which is a felony charge and they said 'you've got a problem.'"</p>
      <p>LaBeouf then discussed his experience in the "head camp," where he was diagnosed with, and began treatment for, post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

      <p>"They said 'we've got a solution' and we started doing this stuff called exposure therapy," LaBeouf recounted. "Through that process, recording all those conversations, was where the movie came from."</p>
      <p>"Honey Boy" tells the story of LaBeouf's time as a child actor on the Disney Channel show "Even Stevens," when he was supporting his "off-color" father, who worked as a clown.</p>
      <p>Finally, LaBeouf revealed that his father didn't have many notes for the movie, but wanted it to express his "relationship he had with a chicken named Henrietta LeFowl who was the world's first daredevil chicken."</p>

      <p>LaBeouf recounted his father's clown act with Henrietta.</p>
      <p>"My dad used to put this chicken on his head and do cartwheels," LaBeouf said. "The chicken would run from his head to his butt, from his head to his butt."</p>
      <p>"Honey Boy" hits theaters Friday.</p>
