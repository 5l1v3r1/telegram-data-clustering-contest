      <h1>NSW Police Minister Says He’s Cool With His “Young Children” Getting Strip-Searched</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T01:20:10+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>NSW Police Minister David Elliott has told cameras that <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-06/nsw-police-minister-david-elliot-children-strip-searches/11676508">he would be fine with his “young children” getting strip-searched.</a></p>
      <p>“I’ve got young children, and if I thought that the police felt that they were at the risk of doing something wrong, I’d want them strip-searched,” Elliott said, in response to a new report that has criticised the NSW Police’s use of the controversial practice.</p>
      <p>That report, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/revealed-nsw-police-strip-searched-more-than-100-girls-including-12-year-olds">exclusively published by <i>The Guardian</i></a>, has revealed that NSW police have strip-searched Australian women as young as 12.</p>
      <p>It notes that 122 girls under the age of 18 have been strip-searched over a period of three years. Over the same time period, almost 4,000 women have been strip-searched, with young women making up about half of that number.</p>

      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/strip-search-safe-sound/187661">The practice has been under close scrutiny over the last year or so</a> due to a ramping up of <a href="https://junkee.com/lameway-berejiklian-parody/226164">Gladys Berejiklian’s War On Festivals</a>. Berejiklian has confused more police officers with more safety, throwing the full weight of the police force against young, vulnerable, and utterly harmless festival-goers. In turn, that has led to a spike in the presence of drug dogs, and strip-search tents.</p>
      <p>A particularly shocking strip-search occurred at Hidden Festival in Sydney, when festival-goer Lucy Moore was allegedly separated from her friends and not properly asked for consent.</p>
      <p>“I was taken away by another police officer and was told nothing of what was about to happen, I was never asked for my consent to be searched let alone my consent to be strip searched,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lucy.moore.3114/posts/2764900090201625">Moore wrote on Facebook</a>.</p>
      <p>“Not only did I see other people being searched, during my search the door was left half open and only “blocked” by the small female cop. I could easily see outside which means that attendees and the male cops outside could have easily seen in as well.”</p>
      <p>Academics have long been criticising the acceptance of strip-searching as a mainstream practice amongst the police. After a report found that <a href="https://junkee.com/nsw-police-strip-searches/218994">the number of strip-searches had increased twentyfold over the period of 2007 to 2019,</a> many decried it as both useless and Draconian.</p>
