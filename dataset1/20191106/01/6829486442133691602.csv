‘Sunrise’ Just Loves That The Melbourne Cup Winner Is A Horse That “Grew Here, Not Flew Here”
06 Nov 2019, 01:02 by Joseph Earp
It’s well established that the Melbourne Cup is deeply problematic event for many Australians — often criticised as a vortex of awful combining animal cruelty, binge drinking, and toxic masculinity. So maybe it’s not so surprising that, thanks to Sunrise, a touch of racism has just been added to that mix.
Yep, somehow Sunrise and Channel 7 have managed to code the story of the Melbourne Cup’s winner with deeply xenophobic rhetoric.
The moment came as the panel and guest, Herald Sun journalist Andrew Rule, were discussing the background of the winner, Vow and Declare. Vow and Declare was born in Melbourne, a fact that should mean nothing to anybody, but was incredibly important to the folks over at Sunrise.
“It’s a lovely story,” Rule said. “This is the horse that grew here, not flew here.”
The “grew here, flew here” rhetoric is one that has long been associated with a particularly virulent strain of Australian nationalism. It’s been a rallying call for racists over the years, particularly popular around Australia day, when it is used to other and objectify anyone who isn’t white.



That racist rhetoric didn’t just stop there, mind you, and it continued in other aspects of the Channel 7 coverage. In a televised news report on the Melbourne Cup yesterday, presenter Ann Sanders calmly told the audience that Vow and Declare had “repelled a host of foreign invaders.”
Later in the same segment, reporter Michelle Bishop mangled a reference to increasingly popular protests against the animal cruelty at the heart of the cup, while doubling down on the “homegrown” aspect of the story.
“It’s just awesome for racing, because we’ve gone through a really tough period with animal cruelty and all of the rest of it. And this is a local horse getting home.”
Keep up the good work, Australian television.
