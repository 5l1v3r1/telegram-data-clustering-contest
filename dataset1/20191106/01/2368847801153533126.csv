蓬佩奧宣布美國正式退出聯合國《巴黎協定》

06 Nov 2019, 01:48

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】美國國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）週一發佈了美國正式退出《巴黎協定》（Paris Agreement）的消息。美國政府已經將這個決定正式通知聯合國，並將在發出通知後一年生效。
美國國務卿蓬佩奧11月4日宣布，美國已以書面方式知會聯合國，美國政府正式啟動退出《巴黎協定》程序。他同時強調，美國將提出有關氣候保護議題的一種「務實和可行的模式」，該模式將兼顧再生性能源和化石能源。
蓬佩奧解釋說，美國退出《巴黎協定》是因考慮到該協定將使美國工人、企業和納稅人的利益嚴重受損。
他在接受福克斯電視台商業頻道的採訪時表示，美國是《巴黎協定》的受害方，「對美國人民和美國工人，它最終是不公平的。」
當天，蓬佩奧在推特上發文稱「美國為我們在減少所有溫室氣體排放、增強適應能力、發展經濟和確保為公民提供能源方面的世界領導地位感到自豪。」
據了解，《巴黎協定》是2015年奧巴馬（Barack Obama）執政時簽署的一個國際協議，從2016年11月4日正式開始生效。華府當時承諾到2025年將美國的溫室氣體排放量在2005年的水平基礎上削減26%至28%。
不過，現任美國總統川普（特朗普）認為這個協定對美國並不公平。他批評該協定在損害美國經濟的同時，卻讓中國等其他污染大國增加廢氣排放量。川普就任美國總統後，於2017年6月宣布退出《巴黎協定》，並承諾振興美國的油氣與煤炭工業。
根據巴黎協定規定，締約國要在協定生效3年後才能正式啟動退出程序，而退出進程需時一年。因此，美國國務院等到今年11月4日才正式致函聯合國秘書長古特雷斯（Antonio Guterres），提交退出文件，宣布華府會將在2020年美國總統大選結束後一天，即2020年11月4日完成退約程序的第一步。
正在中國訪問的法國總統馬克龍對美國正式宣布退出《巴黎協定》表示遺憾。他強調，美國的這一步驟使法中在氣候保護和生物物種多樣性政策方面的合作更為必要。

Pompeo announces the official withdrawal of the United States from the UN Paris Agreement

06 Nov 2019, 01:48

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the United States officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement. The US government has officially notified the United Nations of this decision and will enter into force one year after the notification.
US Secretary of State Pompeo announced on November 4 that the United States has informed the United Nations in writing that the US government has officially initiated the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. He also stressed that the United States will propose a ""pragmatic and feasible model"" on climate protection issues, which will take into account renewable energy and fossil energy.
Pompeo explained that the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement because it would seriously undermine the interests of American workers, businesses and taxpayers.
In an interview with the Fox TV commercial channel, he said that the United States is the victim of the Paris Agreement. ""It is ultimately unfair to the American people and American workers.""
On the same day, Pompeo issued a statement on Twitter that ""the United States is proud of our world leadership in reducing all greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing resilience, developing the economy and ensuring energy for citizens.""
It is understood that the ""Paris Agreement"" is an international agreement signed by Barack Obama in 2015, and will officially take effect on November 4, 2016. At that time, Washington promised to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels.
However, the current US President Trump (Trump) believes that this agreement is not fair to the United States. He criticized the agreement, while damaging the US economy, while allowing other polluting countries such as China to increase emissions. After taking office as President of the United States, Trump announced his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017 and promised to revitalize the US oil and gas and coal industries.
According to the Paris Agreement, the State party will not officially initiate the exit procedure until three years after the entry into force of the agreement, and the withdrawal process will take one year. Therefore, the US State Department waited until November 4 this year to formally write to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to submit an exit document stating that Washington will be one day after the end of the 2020 US presidential election, November 2020. The first step in completing the withdrawal process on the 4th.
French President Mark Long, who is visiting China, regrets that the United States officially announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. He emphasized that this step in the United States made the French cooperation in climate protection and biodiversity policy more necessary.
