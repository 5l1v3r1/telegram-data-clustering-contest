首相、２閣僚辞任で「責任を痛感」…野党は事実関係を追及

06 Nov 2019, 01:57

　衆院予算委員会は６日午後、安倍首相と関係閣僚が出席して集中審議が始まった。菅原一秀・前経済産業相と河井克行・前法相の相次ぐ辞任後、首相の国会出席は初めて。野党は首相の任命責任を厳しく追及し、大学入学共通テストでの英語民間試験の導入を見送った政府の対応もただす。
　首相は２閣僚が「政治とカネ」の問題で辞任したことについて、「私が任命した大臣がわずか１か月の間に相次いで辞任し、国民の皆様に大変申し訳なく、その責任を痛感している」と陳謝した。その上で、「一つ一つの課題に結果を出していくことで、国民の皆様の信頼回復に努めていく」と語った。
　野党共同会派の渡辺周氏や大串博志氏らは、２閣僚を起用した理由をただし、一連の疑惑の事実関係を追及する。英語民間試験については、導入決定から見送りになった経緯を確認し、萩生田文部科学相の責任を問う。

I apologize. "" After that, he said, “We will strive to restore the trust of our citizens by giving results to each issue.”
