The tech experts over at Digital Foundry recently looked at Luigi's Mansion 3 to see how it compared to its predecessors and found it to be a shocking technical feat for the Nintendo Switch.
In terms of the resolution, the game runs at 1980x1080 in docked mode during gameplay but can drop to 900p in cutscenes. In portable mode, the resolution runs at 1280x720 but again falls during cutscenes.
As for the frame rate, the game runs at a mostly stable 30fps in docked mode. To achieve 30fps in portable mode, some additional effects have been cut, resulting in a blurrier look overall. Despite this, Luigi's Mansion 3 is still one of the best-looking games available on the Switch.
