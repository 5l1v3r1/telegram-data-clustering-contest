      <p>(Reuters) - Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner, creators of mock rock music documentary “This is Spinal Tap”, said they had resolved a dispute with Vivendi’s Universal Music Group over the film’s soundtrack recordings.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, which was announced on Tuesday, Spinal Tap’s recordings will continue to be distributed through UMG and eventually the rights will be given to the creators.</p>
      <p>A mediator had been working on resolving the dispute since November last year.</p>
      <p>Vivendi has controlled Spinal Tap rights for nearly three decades.</p>
      <p>The original complaint from the plaintiffs had stated that Vivendi had estimated the plaintiffs’ share of Spinal Tap income at a mere $81 from merchandising between 1984 and 2016, plus $98 from music sales between 1989 and 2016.</p>
      <p>“This Is Spinal Tap” is a pioneering example of the mock documentary, known for details including the deaths of drummers under bizarre circumstances and spectacular, over-the-top stage entrances that go wrong.</p>
