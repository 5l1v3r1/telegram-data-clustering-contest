IAS topper Tina Dabi Khan and her civil servant husband Athar Aamir Khan have been dubbed as one of the most affable couples on social media. Such is the public adulation for both of them that they have accumulated quite a large following on social media in such a short time. They started as a shy couple but, with the passage of time, Tina and Athar have grown in confidence. A testament to this are some of Tina’s latest social media posts, where she has been flaunting her beauty and showcasing Diwali celebrations with a Bollywood touch. On Sunday, the Kashmiri bahu went a step further to publicly pronounce her love for Athar as she inundated her husband’s timeline with red hearts. Her bold step triggered a wave of reactions from the couple’s die-hard fans, who too responded by emulating her action with Athar’s timeline soon facing a deluge of sorts as red hearts rained incessantly.



This was after Athar posted a photo of himself without any caption. Dressed in a black T-shirt, Athar looked uber cool. No sooner did he share his photo, Tina took to Instagram to post a series of red hearts in a bid to publicly pronounce her love for her husband.



This opened the floodgate of comments from their fans. One wrote, “you both together look the most powerful picture of India.” Another fan commented, “@dabi_tina mam it could just be me, but since very first day when I saw you both giving speeches in various institutes after UPSC results, I knew you are in love. Just look at how you pay attention and look at him in every video of you both, you had such big smile. Everytime he was speaking. I am glad you both are married. 😬”



Tina had recently shared the list of books that she had read with her profound reviews. This was days after she painted her Instagram timeline with beautiful Rangoli designs. The books recommended by the IAS topper included Chitra Banerjee’s The Palace of Illusions,  Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture, To Sir With Love by ER Braithwaite, Zen The Art of Simple Living by Shunmyo Masuno and A World Of Three Zeroes by Nobel Laureate Muhamamd Yunus.



After securing the all India number one ranking in the IAS exams in 2016, Tina fell in love with Athar, who had secured all India number two ranking in the same year. They got married last year and are currently posted as SDMs in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara district.
