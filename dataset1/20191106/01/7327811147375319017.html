      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- New Yorkers are used to seeing street vendors, but a new proposal would allow for more on the city streets.</p>
      <p>A state lawmaker wants to eliminate the cap on street vendor permits to allow more people to have their own business.</p>
      <p>But critics say that's going to create more problems for existing stores.</p>
      <p>The vendors are part of the fabric of the city, selling just about every kind of food imaginable.</p>
      <p>Ali Tarek, manning his family cart in Midtown Manhattan, weighed in on the issue.</p>
      <p>"I think for them to be able to work, they should no limit the numbers, should be able to do what they want to do," said Tarek.</p>
      <p>State Senator Jessica Ramos of Queens is proposing legislation that would do away with limiting the number of carts.</p>
      <p>Right now the city issues about 5,100 permits but there's a long wait list. So many instead turn to the black market, where the licenses, which cost $200, are illegally rented out, in some cases for $25,000.</p>
      <p>Ramos believes her bill would help those vendors come into compliance with current permitted vendors.</p>
      <p>"These are folks who are trying to make an honest living and we really need to take advantage of this economic opportunity to generate about $70 million in additional sales tax revenue for the city and state," she said.</p>
      <p>Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, acknowledges the current system is broken.</p>
      <p>However, like Mayor Bill de Blasio, he believes doing away with the cap would be a mistake, and that the focus should instead be on a much tighter enforcement system.</p>
      <p>"It's not anti vendor but we have crowded, busy streets," said Rigie. "We have brick and mortar restaurants throughout the city, a lot of vacant storefronts, so we need to support small businesses and make sure, if there are any new permits that are issued, it's done in a sensible way for New York City."</p>
      <p>It would still be up to each city to decide where these carts can and can not drop anchor. As for Ali, the next generation of food vendors: "I don't want to continue with the business," he said. "I want to switch, be a lawyer of something like that."</p>
