      <p>The <b>2020 Jaguar F-Type</b> has been recalled due to models with the 3.0-litre supercharged V6 making too much noise.</p>
      <p>It appears you can have too much of a good thing, because <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/">Jaguar</a> says the "static noise level exceeds the regulated maximum decibel limit" in the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/f-type/">F-Type</a> V6.</p>
      <p>A total of <b>28 cars</b> are included in the campaign â€“ a VIN list is <a href="https://www.productsafety.gov.au/system/files/VIN%20list_118.pdf"><b>attached here</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Jaguar will contact owners of the affected vehicles and advise them to organise a free 'fix' with their nearest dealership.</p>
