FOURTH generation department store Dixons of Coleraine is to close in January with the loss of 22 jobs.
Staff at the family-owned retailer, which has been in business for almost 125 years, were informed of the decision earlier this week.
It follows a period of down-sizing by the independent retailer, which saw the company close outlets in Newtownards and its Gerry Weber fashion store in south Belfast.
Managing director Ian Dixon said he made the decision not to renew the leases on the stores and instead focus his energies on the Coleraine business
Mr Dixon, who took over the business from his parents Joan and Harold, admitted earlier this year that as he did not have another generation to follow in his footsteps and take over the company.
He confirmed that the business will close in the new year, but said that the premises could reopen in future under a new tenant.
