      <h1>Hartalega dips 1.46% on lower 2Q earnings</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): Shares in Hartalega Holdings Bhd dipped 1.46% this morning after the glovemaker saw a 13% drop in its net profit to RM103.87 million in its second financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (2QFY20) from RM120.22 million a year ago, due to lower average selling price (ASP) and higher packaging and fuel costs.</p>
      <p>At 9.08am, Hartalega fell 8 sen to RM5.39, valuing the group at RM18.18 billion.</p>
      <p>The lower ASP dragged the group’s quarterly revenue marginally lower to RM709.42 million from RM714.24 million in 2QFY19, the nitrile glove manufacturer’s exchange filing showed.</p>
      <p>Despite lower profitability, Hartalega’s board declared its first interim single-tier dividend of 1.8 sen per share in respect of the financial year ending June 30, 2020 (FY20). The dividend is payable on Dec 27.</p>
      <p>Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd analyst Farah Diyana Kamaludin wrote in a note today that Hartalega's 1HFY20 core profit after tax and minority interest of RM199.4 million was below both Hong Leong's and consensus expectation.</p>
      <p>"The results came in below both our and consensus expectations at 42.3% and 41.5% respectively. The key culprit for the results shortfall was lower ASP (-2.2% quarter-on-quarter, -6.9% year-on-year) and higher effective tax rate (15.4% in 2QFY19 versus 24.1% in 2QFY20).</p>
      <p>"We cut FY20-22 numbers by 12.2%, 14.1% and 13.8% respectively as we account for lower ASP moving forward," Farah Diyana said.</p>
      <p>She said Hong Leong maintained its "hold" call on Hartalega shares but with a higher target price of RM5.10, from RM4.78 previously.</p>
