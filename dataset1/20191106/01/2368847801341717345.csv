71機構被查立案180件 FBI調查鎖定華裔科學家

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】美國聯邦調查局(FBI) 與美國國立衛生院(NIH) 聯手，正在針對美國生物醫學智慧財產權被竊盜情況展開大規模調查。迄今為止已有71家機構被查，其中不乏知名醫學院等頂尖研究機構，並已累計立案調查了180起個案，而這些案件中大多數被調查的對象都是華裔人士。
據《紐約時報》報導，美國國立衛生院和FBI已聯手展開大規模調查，致力揪出竊盜美國研究成果給中國的科學家。幾乎所有被查的研究人員都是華人，包括歸化美籍者，他們被控為中國竊取機密科學研究。
NIH表示，在已經進行調查的案件中，有24起案件存在明顯的刑事犯罪證據，已提交衛生福利部(HHS)檢察官辦公室進行更深入的調查。而相關調查讓人擔憂，中共政府正濫用美國相對開放的科學體系進行「大規模經濟間諜行動」。
NIH署外研究副主任勞爾(Michael Lauer)稱，被指控的竊盜案件並非軍事機密，但涉及科學理念、設計、裝置、數據和方法，未來可能透過新穎療法和診斷工具獲利。其中，有部分面臨調查的研究員獲得了美國政府或機構贊助，但研究成果卻在中國取得專利；還有一些面臨調查的科學家暗中在中國成立了實驗室，並秘密複製美國的研究。
礙於程序問題，NIH並未點出大多數面臨調查的科學家和機構的名稱，不過公開的資訊顯示，近期至少有12位著名的科學家已從其任職的大學或研究機構卸任或被開除。
據報導，FBI已提供研究機構各種工具，掃描電郵中的華語關鍵字，從中尋找可疑的智財權竊盜漏洞。NIH稱，「這種影響將很深遠，我們難以面對信任關係，也不習慣系統性欺騙。」
今年10月中旬，全球第二大開源代碼託管平台GitLab的副總裁埃里克•約翰遜（Eric Johnson）在其社區官網的「議題（Issue）」討論區發佈了一篇題為《建立工作國家/地區封鎖》的文章，宣布該公司將啟用「工作國家/地區封鎖（job family country block）」的政策。該「封鎖」政策生效後，將對現員工的居住地進行限制，而且不再面向中國和俄羅斯國籍的公民提供崗位。
約翰遜表示，領導團隊決定為「能夠接觸客戶數據」的員工提供一個「工作國家區塊」。但是在「一些企業客戶表達關切」之後，公司考慮到「當前地緣環境」，決定將中國和俄羅斯排除在外。
該文指出，公司的決議正式執行後，該公司將「遵循形勢下的行業普遍做法」，在招聘過程中，不向中、俄兩國公民提供崗位，同時將禁止現員工前往這兩個國家，否則將面臨停職。

71 institutions were found to have filed 180 cases. FBI investigations targeted Chinese scientists.

06 Nov 2019, 01:54

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing, November 06, 2019] The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is conducting a large-scale investigation into the theft of US biomedical intellectual property rights. So far, 71 institutions have been investigated, including many top research institutions such as well-known medical schools, and 180 cases have been investigated, and most of these cases were investigated by Chinese.
According to the New York Times, the National Institutes of Health and the FBI have teamed up to conduct a large-scale investigation to bring out scientists who have stolen American research results to Chinese scientists. Almost all the researchers surveyed were Chinese, including naturalized Americans, who were accused of stealing confidential scientific research in China.
According to the NIH, 24 of the cases that have been investigated have evident evidence of criminal offences and have been submitted to the Office of the Health and Welfare (HHS) Prosecutor for a more in-depth investigation. The relevant investigations are worrying. The Chinese government is abusing the relatively open scientific system of the United States for ""massive economic espionage.""
Michael Lauer, deputy director of NIH's external research, said the alleged theft was not a military secret, but involved scientific ideas, design, devices, data and methods that might benefit from novel therapies and diagnostic tools in the future. Among them, some researchers who are under investigation have been sponsored by the US government or institutions, but the research results have been patented in China; some scientists who are facing investigations secretly set up laboratories in China and secretly copied American studies.
Due to procedural issues, the NIH did not name the names of most scientists and institutions facing the survey, but public information indicates that at least 12 prominent scientists have recently resigned or been expelled from their university or research institution.
According to reports, the FBI has provided various tools for research institutions to scan Chinese-language keywords in emails to find suspicious intellectual property theft loopholes. According to NIH, ""This impact will be far-reaching. It is difficult for us to face trust and we are not used to systematic deception.""
In mid-October this year, Eric Johnson, vice president of GitLab, the world's second-largest open source code hosting platform, published an article entitled ""Working in the Country of Work"" in the ""Issue"" discussion forum on its community website. The article on the regional blockade announced that the company will implement the ""job family country block"" policy. After the ""blockade"" policy comes into effect, the current residence of the employees will be restricted and no longer available to citizens of Chinese and Russian nationality.
Johnson said the leadership team decided to provide a ""working country block"" for employees who are able to reach customer data. However, after “some corporate customers expressed concern”, the company decided to exclude China and Russia from the “current geopolitical environment”.
The article pointed out that after the company's resolution is officially implemented, the company will ""follow the general industry practices under the situation"", in the recruitment process, not to provide jobs to Chinese and Russian citizens, and will prohibit current employees from going to these two countries. Otherwise, they will face suspension.
