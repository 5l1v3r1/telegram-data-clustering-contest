AIB job cuts won't impact First Trust says lender

06 Nov 2019, 01:00

FIRST Trust has said it will be unaffected by possible job cuts within its parent bank AIB.
A trading statement from the Dublin-headquartered lender yesterday said it expected to finish the year with less than 9,500 employees. The bank had 9,830 staff on its books midway through 2019 and last month launched a voluntary severance scheme.
It also placed a temporary halt on recruitment and promotions during October.
A spokesperson for First Trust said yesterday that the moves would have no impact on its operations in the north. The lender, which will rebrand as AIB next year, currently has 15 branches in the north, around half the number of outlets it operated five years ago.
