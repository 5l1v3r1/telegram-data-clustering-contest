      <p>FORMER Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt is reported to be critically ill in a Dublin hospital.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year a court was told that the Co Louth republican was terminally ill with cancer.</p>
      <p>A Provisional IRA 'quartermaster', he walked way from the organisation in 1997 following a meeting in Donegal during which he was outspoken about its ceasefire and the political direction in which it was heading.</p>
      <p>McKevitt (70) is thought to have retained large quantities of IRA weapons that he refused to hand over for decommissioning and, along with a number of other, mainly border-based hardliners, went on to form the dissident republican RIRA.</p>
      <p>Married to Bernadette Sands McKevitt, a sister of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, he lived in Blackrock, Co Louth.</p>
      <p>After the Real IRA's 1998 Omagh bombing, which claimed 29 lives including a woman pregnant with twins, support for the continuation of armed republicanism plummeted.</p>
      <p>McKevitt was convicted in 2003 of membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism between August 1999 and October 2000.</p>
      <p>He denied involvement in the Omagh atrocity but in 2009 was found liable along with three other men by a civil court in a case taken by victims' relatives.</p>
      <p>He was released from prison in 2016 after the parole board was told of his failing health.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, in a case arising out of a failure to pay damages, relatives brought proceedings before the High Court in Dublin seeking to have McKevitt adjudicated bankrupt.</p>
      <p>He did not appear but the court was told he had no assets, had terminal cancer and his only source of income was the state pension.</p>
      <p>One of the last times he was photographed publicly was in January last year at the funeral of his mother-in-law Rosaleen Sands in Co Louth.</p>
