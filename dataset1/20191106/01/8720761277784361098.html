Musk also tweeted that it's the location and month in the opening credits of the movie Blade Runner. From a report:<i> Musk has teased the pickup truck before. In summer 2018, he said the truck would include "power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V high power tools in the field all day, no generator needed." In January, he said that Tesla might be ready to unveil it by the summer "It will be something quite unique, unlike anything," Musk said at the time. Then, in June, Musk said on the podcast "Ride the Lightning" that the Tesla pickup truck "will be better than a [Ford] F-150 in terms of truck-like functionality, and be a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911."</i></p>
