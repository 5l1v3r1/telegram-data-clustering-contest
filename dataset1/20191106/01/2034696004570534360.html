      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> will be releasing a new song next week.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram story today (November 6), the pop star told her fans that a new <i>Vanity Fair</i> piece about her wouldn’t be out for a few weeks, but as a “compromise” she’d be releasing a new song next week. See screengrabs of her story below.</p>

      <p>This comes shortly after Eilish announced, also on Instagram stories, that she’d be dropping new music and a video for ‘Xanny’, from her <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/billie-eilish-album-review-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go">debut album, ‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’. </a>In that earlier post, she stopped short of announcing a release date or window.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>In the dimly lit video, Eilish speaks to the camera: “Yes, the ‘Xanny’ video is coming. Yes, I have two unreleased songs that are coming that you haven’t heard any of.” After a pause, she remarks, “Be patient, damn!”</p>
      <p>Watch it here via an Eilish Twitter fan account, which saved the Instagram story:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/finneas-confirms-billie-eilish-writing-new-material-interview-2559586">Eilish has been writing new songs</a>, her brother and songwriting partner Finneas revealed last month. “We’re deep into the creative process on new material for sure,” he told Zane Lowe. “She’s in a really good place.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-feels-haunted-by-pressure-of-recording-her-next-album-2563030">Eilish has also expressed anxiety about her sophomore album</a>, saying it “haunts” her.</p>
      <p>“There was a period where I was like, ‘Do I even enjoy music?’” she said in a conversation with Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong. “It just felt like so much touring. And I don’t mean the shows. The shows are always my favourite part. But it was just traveling and being alone all the time, on a cold bus in Europe, horrible food, and when you come back, everyone’s kind of moved on from you.”</p>
      <p>Eilish will embark on a sold-out North American tour in March 2020, and will tour South America before <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-announces-huge-2020-uk-arena-tour-2551942">heading to the UK in the summer</a>. She was also recently announced as one of the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-billie-eilish-twenty-one-pilots-announced-mad-cool-festival-2020-2562189">headliners of Mad Cool Festival 2020</a>.</p>
