      <p>TOKYO (Nov 6): The dollar held the upper hand against its rivals on Wednesday, particularly versus traditional safe-haven currencies, on rising hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal and a string of solid U.S. economic data.</p>
      <p>The dollar index against major currencies was at 97.936, after rising 0.37% on Tuesday to 97.912.</p>
      <p>Against the yen, the dollar traded at 109.16 yen, down 0.01% from late U.S. levels but near its October high of 109.285 and a three-month high of 109.25 hit on Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>The Swiss franc changed hands at 0.9930 to the dollar following its 0.5% fall the previous day, while gold tumbled 1.73% on Tuesday and last stood at $1,484.1 per ounce, near the lower end of its trading range over the past month.</p>
      <p>The euro stood at $1.1075, having dropped 0.49% on Tuesday and was not far from a near three-week low of $1.10635 hit in U.S. trade.</p>
      <p>Hopes that the Trump administration could roll back some of tariffs it has imposed on goods from China as a part of a "phase one" U.S.-China trade deal boosted risk sentiment in financial markets.</p>
      <p>A survey on the vast U.S. service sector published on Tuesday showed the business sentiment has improved in October from a three-year low in September.</p>
      <p>The ISM non-manufacturing sector index rose to 54.7 from 52.6 in September, beating market expectations.</p>
      <p>The rebound is a welcome sign for dollar bulls as a fall in the index would have suggested that malaise in trade war-hit manufacturers was infecting the service sector, too.</p>
      <p>The data came after strong U.S. employment data on Friday.</p>
      <p>"On top of Sino-U.S. trade issues, the market is reacting to signs of U.S. economic strength at the moment," said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of foreign exchange at Societe Generale.</p>
      <p>The positive mood spilled over to the risk-sensitive Australian dollar, which changed hands at $0.6894. It was little changed on the day but has maintained gains of 3.4% since hitting a 10-1/2-year low on Oct. 2.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan traded at 7.0005 yuan per dollar, after having risen to three-month high of 6.9867 to the dollar on Tuesday on rising trade deal hopes.</p>
      <p>The currency has gained 2.8 percent from its record low in the offshore trade marked in early September. - Reuters</p>
