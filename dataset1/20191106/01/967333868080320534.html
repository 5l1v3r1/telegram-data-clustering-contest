      <p>The recent study, conducted by WalletHub, a personal finance website, cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data revealing that 7 out of 10 Americans aged 20 or older are overweight or obese.</p>
      <blockquote>“'Fat' is becoming the new normal in America,” <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/fattest-states/16585/">the report noted</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>The WalletHub study found that among the top 5 states with fat adults, Mississippi took first place, followed by West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama.</p>
      <p>WalletHub’s “Fattest States” report listed Utah as the least fat state, exceeding Colorado, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California.</p>
      <p>The capital of the country, Washington DC, found its way into the bottom 10 of the study.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201801181060839733-southern-US-army-recruits-overweight-threaten-military-readiness/">Obesity is a serious problem</a> in the United States. The country spends an estimated $200 billion in providing health care related to obesity. The diet control business sector has gained over $72 billion yearly, according to data cited in the report.</blockquote>
      <p>Rates of obesity among children and teens <a href="https://sputniknews.com/art_living/201706131054569820-one-quarter-overweight-or-obese/">are significantly lower</a>, although they are higher in comparison with those of the last few decades, according to the summary.</p>
      <p>At the same time, 82.1 million of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201810111068775303-greek-island-bans-tourists-riding-donkeys/">American people older than six</a> were “completely inactive in 2018”, a major factor for obesity, alongside genetics, emotional instability and lack of sleep, WalletHub said, referring to Physical Activity Council research.</p>
