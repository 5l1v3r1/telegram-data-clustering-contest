      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals">royal reunion</a> is on the way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/kate">Kate Middleton</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/will">Prince William</a> are set to join Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles for Remembrance Day ceremonies, starting on Saturday for the Festival of Remembrance Service at Royal Albert Hall.</p>

      <p>The reunion comes after the announced split of charity work by Harry and Meghan from that of William and Kate, and a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-appears-to-hint-at-rift-between-him-and-prince-william">rumored feud</a> between the royal brothers.</p>
      <p>"We’re certainly on different paths at the moment," Harry said about himself and William in the television documentary "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry-documentary-things-learned-duke-duchess-sussex">Harry &amp; Meghan: An African Journey</a>."</p>
      <p>"I’ll always be there for him and as I know, he’ll always be there for me. We don’t see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy, but I love him dearly. As brothers, we have good days and we have bad days.”</p>
