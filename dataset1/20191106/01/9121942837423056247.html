      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese protesters are rallying outside state institutions and ministries to keep up the pressure on officials to form a new government to deal with the country’s economic crisis.</p>
      <p>Dozens of people gathered on Wednesday outside the justice, education and other ministries as well as the state-run electricity company and the tax department.</p>
      <p>In their third week, protesters have adopted a new tactic of surrounding state institutions to disrupt their work. They accuse officials of dragging their feet on forming a new government after Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned on Oct. 29 in response to mass protests.</p>
      <p>The protesters agreed on Tuesday to shift the focus of the protests and open main roads to ease up traffic and allow people to get back to work.</p>
