【唐靖遠快評】如何解讀習近平全過程民主

06 Nov 2019, 01:54

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】觀眾朋友大家好，我是唐靖遠。今天是2019年11月5號星期二，很高興能夠以熱點互動快評這種方式繼續和朋友們交流，就當前的一些熱點聊聊我個人的看法。



今天想和大家聊的話題，和習近平有關。就是他去上海考察的時候說了一句話，說中國人民的民主是「全過程的民主」。此話一出，馬上引起了傳媒界的關注。因為這個全過程民主的提法，是習近平上台以來頭一遭，是個新詞，時間又恰逢四中全會剛結束，他公開說這話究竟有什麼目的，當然就成了焦點。而且更引人注目的是，在隨後新華社，人民日報發佈的通稿中，習近平這段話被忽略掉了。這就引起更多猜測，甚至有的覺得這是不是王滬寧又在太歲頭上動土，居然敢屏蔽習近平的講話，是不是黨內又出現了新的內鬥動向等等。那麼我們接下來就討論一下這個話題。
首先，習近平這個講話，是他在四中全會結束後首次露面，而且是前往上海考察順便出席第二屆進博會時講的，按官方說法，這是習近平親自前往上海推動「深入學習貫徹黨的十九屆四中全會精神」，在這樣的背景下發生的。所以我覺得可以肯定一點，他的考察也好，要說什麼話也好，雖然沒有看到他拿着稿子念，但應該都是早就準備好的，不會是他心血來潮了突發驚人語。
既然是準備好的，那麼考察地點、對象等等，按中共例行機制，一定是提前精心挑選安排好了的。我們就先看看他考察的地點。根據官方的報導，他考察地點是上海長寧區虹橋街道的古北區市民中心。這個地方有沒有什麼特殊性呢？有，這個古北區是上海第一家有規模的國際居住新區，居住了大量來自歐美日韓和港澳台等地區的商人和企業代表，因此被稱為上海的「小聯合國」。現有三萬多人口，其中一半以上來自境外，是上海外國人密度最高的居民區，2015年，全國人大常委會法工委在古北設立基層立法聯繫點。按官方媒體說法，最近四年來近兩千人參與立法意見徵詢。
這是第一個比較重要的特殊背景。還有一個特殊背景需要介紹一下，就是習近平這次去的古北區市民中心有一個古北市民議事廳，這個議事廳由區黨委出面在當地選出12位市民議事員主持，中國籍和外國籍各一半，平時負責收集居民的意見、問題等等，定期和小區物業、人大代表等等基層管理人員討論議題，然後這些議題經過當地黨組織批准後，可以交由政府部門去落實。
剛才花了不少時間介紹這些背景，就是想說明，這個古北區的市民中心，一直被中共宣傳為一個「基層民主自治平台」，黨媒多次有報導，而且顯然是一個作為對海外宣傳的樣板工程來對待。
這麼一說我想大家可能都清楚了，習近平到這樣一個地方去發表有關中國式民主的講話，而且去的時候剛好在舉行法律草案的意見徵詢會，當然不是偶然，而是精心的安排。而且我覺得他的主要意圖很清楚，就是要借這個樣板工程為示範，來對國際社會發表他對民主的理解。換言之，他要通過這個方式來爭奪「什麼是民主」這個定義的話語權。
那麼說到民主的定義，毫無疑問就涉及到美國了。我們都知道美國是當今國際社會最具代表性的民主國家，習近平要爭奪民主定義的話語權，最大的對手當然就是美國。事實上，習近平的這次講話，的確也有含蓄回應彭斯和蓬佩奧兩人最近的演講的意味。在彭斯蓬佩奧的演講中，都用了很重的筆墨來強調中共極權制度與民主自由的對立，也都有鼓勵習近平當局擁抱民主自由的言辭。只不過我們看到習近平的回應很清楚，他的說法就是：現在中共的統治就是民主的，只不過是一種有中共特色的，和西方社會完全不同的民主制度。
這裏我們就可以看到，中共非常擅長的詭辯邏輯和語言詐術，再次派上了用場。我相信習近平自己應該創造不出這一套似是而非的理論，這套東西很可能仍然是王滬寧這種專業的政治化妝師搗鼓出來的假理論偽命題。
這就帶來一個問題，雖然中共極權制早已臭名昭著被稱為赤納粹，但為什麼中共仍然要抓住民主這塊遮羞布不放，而且還要這麼絞盡腦汁大做文章呢？這背後最根本的一個原因，是中共擴張推廣中共模式的軟實力所需。
這次四中全會公報，中共定下了14件大事，其中之一就是要積極參與全球治理體系的改革和建設。注意這裏的「改革」這個詞，他不僅僅是要參與全球治理，還要成為管理者，因為只有管理者才有權力進行除舊佈新的改革，而美國主導的自由民主的全球治理體系，顯然就是中共想要改革掉的對象。
也就是說，習近平給民主進行中共特色式的新定義，最迫切的目的是想扭轉中共獨裁極權體制備受指責的被動態勢，他要藉助大外宣打一場輿論戰，為中共極權模式披上一件漂亮的民主外衣包裝，這樣才方便後續的推銷。
其次，中共極權現在開始出現一個明顯趨勢，就是越來越走入反面的極端。表現在黨文化的語言系統中，就是中共越來越毫無顧忌的公開偷換普世價值的內涵和定義。比如人權的基本含義，是人的生命權、自由權以及不受奴役、酷刑，保有言論自由和財產等權利。這是得到全世界公認並寫入《世界人權宣言》的。但中共就公開扭曲這個定義，說什麼中國國情不同，中共對人權的理解是生存權和發展權——這樣一來，等於無形中把人權最重要的人之所以為人的道德屬性、社會屬性和哲學人文屬性全部剝離了，人權變成了一個簡單的動物屬性，只要讓你活着就是保障了你的人權。
前中聯辦主任張曉明在雨傘運動期間曾經公開對民主派議員說：你們被允許活着，就已經顯示了中央的包容——為什麼一個高級官員說出如此殺氣騰騰的反人類語言，他卻覺得很自然，沒覺得有什麼不妥，說明在中共這個暴力構建的體制中，這種被扭曲篡改的概念，在體制內已經非常普及甚至深入骨髓。
從這個例子可以看出，中共是把民眾當動物看待的，他們洗腦的概念就是，你只要有吃有喝能夠活着，黨沒有隨意宰殺你，你已經就算是有了人權。至於其他的，什麼言論自由權、財產權或集會權等等，統統不在黨的人權定義範圍內。所以我們就看到，中共可以在大規模迫害法輪功學員，迫害新疆少數民族以及各種各樣維權人士，異見人士的時候，仍然有膽子理直氣壯公開說中國的人權狀況處於歷史最好時期，甚至比美國還好五倍等等。很多人會覺得這些官員是不是神經不正常，其實不是，就是因為中共扭曲篡改了人權的定義內涵，還衍生出了一套歪理邪說，當然順理成章成為中共把侵犯人權的行為合理化、合法化的工具。
從這個角度講，習近平的全過程民主，也是同樣的黨文化機制運行下的必然產物。中共是不是民主制？這可以說是一個智商問題，任何正常人都會覺得習近平這說法太匪夷所思，但他就這麼面不改色告訴你，中共定義的民主，就是這個樣子。你們此前理解的民主定義，那是西方陳舊的過去式，現在中共的定義才是新定義，也叫中共特色的定義。我想他要表達的，就是這麼個主題。而且這種類似的詭辯邏輯，幾乎成為萬能的擋箭牌，掩蓋了中共所有的罪惡。
過去一個人要是犯了罪想為自己開脫，是盡量掩蓋罪行，偽造證據，表現的好像自己沒幹這事。在中共眼中，這些手段都弱爆了，中共現在玩的是高級階段，它們直接把善惡的標準來個180度徹底顛倒，好的說成最壞，壞的說成最好。他們會大大方方承認殺了人或搶了錢，然後操縱輿論和五毛告訴你，這樣的行為才是正確的，革命的、愛國的。所以在黨文化語言系統中，盜竊知識產權不是犯罪，而是「爭取發展的權利」，非法關押酷刑民眾不是犯罪，而是「進行法制教育或者職業培訓」，反過來，對竊賊進行罰款或判刑不叫兌現正義，而是侵犯國家主權或者侵犯人權。
類似的例子還有很多，像不干涉內政啦，一國兩制，以及中英聲明是歷史文件等等，中共都在耍弄這樣一套扭曲內涵的詐術。任何對中共不利的指控，中共現在的對策就是直接宣稱這些指控的定義是錯誤的，中共有自己的特色新定義。中共現在不知哪來的勇氣，很多反智、反常識，反人類的說法，都經常被官方堂而皇之端出來，這可能就是中共所謂理論自信、道路自信的來源了。
這樣的詐術一旦普遍使用，我們就看到中共出現一個明顯特徵，就是嘴上說的和實際做的，是截然相反，完全對立。那麼可能很多朋友就想到這一點了，就是習近平嘴上說中共現在最民主，是全過程民主，是否他真正做的也是截然相反，是全過程的獨裁？
是的，在我看來他這個講話的確有這樣的信號在裏面。就是說，每當中共開始強調什麼的時候，往往意味着它馬上就要往相反的方向去幹什麼。一個比較明顯的證據，就是我們看到基本上就在習近平說中共是全過程民主的同時，公安部長趙克志就在公安系統傳達四中全會精神的會議上喊出了「公安姓黨」的口號。
當然，誰都知道，公安系統其實從來都沒有不姓黨，從延安時代公安系統就一直是黨的刀把子到現在沒變過。所以我想趙克志真正的意思，是公安姓習，黨不是抽象存在，黨現在就是習近平在領導。所以他特意喊公安姓黨，明顯是要表達支持習近平進一步集權到個人的信號。趙克志是習近平一手提拔的親信，算是習家軍，他這個帶頭示範的動作，是否能夠帶動一波表態潮，還需要觀察，但這背後進一步集權，進一步完成你是草民，我主宰一切的中共式民主，這個信號是很清晰的。
最後補充一點看法：習近平全過程民主的提法是第一次提出，按說應該被黨媒大肆渲染一番「新時代的理論創新」等等才對，但事實上只有新華微評發了一小段評論來襯托一下，幾大黨媒都沒有刊登這段話。我覺得這並不是什麼王滬寧膽子大了不給習近平面子，敢刪他最重要的講話。這更像是一種精心的安排，目的是不讓習近平這番顛覆人們常識認知的講話引起太大震動。
因為這個講話，說嚴重一點，在直接挑戰美國立國之本的價值觀定義，矛頭直指美國。如果文宣系統大肆渲染，有可能引發一場比NBA事件更嚴重的中美價值觀衝突。而現實是中美正處於談判敏感期，習近平沒有必要也不想在這個時候和美國挑起一場價值觀爭奪戰。所以，他需要有套說法來回應彭斯和蓬佩奧包括回應國際社會，但又不想太高調了造成反效果，所以黨媒不發表的最大原因，很可能只是為了不刺激美國，避免弄巧成拙而已。
好了，今天的討論就暫時到這裏，謝謝大家的觀看，也非常歡迎大家留言互動，並點贊、訂閱。謝謝各位。

[Tang Jingyuan Quick Review] How to Interpret Xi Jinping's Whole Process Democracy

06 Nov 2019, 01:54

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Hello everyone, I am Tang Jingyuan. Today is Tuesday, November 5th, 2019. I am very happy to continue to communicate with friends in the way of hot interactive commentary. I will talk about my personal views on some current hot spots.



The topic I want to talk to with you today is related to Xi Jinping. When he went to Shanghai to inspect, he said a word that the democracy of the Chinese people is ""the whole process of democracy."" When this was said, it immediately caught the attention of the media. Because this whole process of democracy is the first time since Xi Jinping took office, it is a new word. Time coincides with the end of the Fourth Plenary Session. He publicly said that what purpose this statement has, of course, has become the focus. What's even more striking is that Xi Jinping's words were ignored in the subsequent Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily. This has caused more speculation. Some even think that this is whether Wang Huning has been working on the age of too old, and he dared to shield Xi Jinping’s speech. Is there a new infighting trend in the party? Then let's discuss this topic next.
First of all, Xi Jinping’s speech was his first appearance after the Fourth Plenary Session, and he went to Shanghai to inspect and attend the second session of the Expo. According to the official statement, this is Xi Jinping’s personal visit to Shanghai to promote “in-depth study and implementation of the party”. The spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Nineteenth Central Committee, took place in this context. So I think it’s a bit certain. His investigation is good. If you want to say anything, although he didn’t see him reading the manuscript, he should have been prepared for a long time. It’s not a shock to his whim. .
Since it is ready, then the location, objects, etc., according to the CCP’s routine mechanism, must be carefully selected in advance. Let's take a look at the location of his visit. According to official reports, his inspection site is the Gubei District Civic Center in Hongqiao Street, Changning District, Shanghai. Is there any particularity in this place? Yes, this Gubei District is the first large-scale international residential area in Shanghai. It is home to a large number of merchants and business representatives from Europe, America, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. It is therefore known as the ""small UN"" in Shanghai. More than 30,000 people, more than half of them from overseas, are the highest density residential areas in Shanghai. In 2015, the NPC Standing Committee Legal Work Committee set up a grassroots legislative contact point in Gubei. According to official media, nearly 2,000 people have participated in legislative consultations in the past four years.
This is the first special background that is important. There is also a special background to be introduced. It is the Gubei District Civic Center where Xi Jinping went to this time. There is a Gubei Citizens Chamber of Deputies. This council is elected by the district party committee to elect 12 members of the civil affairs committee. Chinese and foreign nationalities respectively Half, usually responsible for collecting opinions, problems, etc. of residents, and regularly discussing issues with grassroots managers such as community property and people's congresses. These issues can then be submitted to the government for approval after approval by local party organizations.
I just spent a lot of time introducing these backgrounds. I just want to explain that this civic center in the Gubei District has been promoted by the CCP as a ""base-level democratic self-government platform."" The party media has reported many times, and it is obviously a publicity for overseas. The model works to treat.
I think everyone may be clear about this. Xi Jinping went to such a place to make a speech about Chinese-style democracy, and when he went there, he was just holding a consultation meeting on the draft law. Of course, it was not accidental, but elaborate arrangements. Moreover, I think his main intention is very clear. He wants to use this model project as a demonstration to express his understanding of democracy in the international community. In other words, he wants to compete for the right to speak of the definition of ""what is democracy"" in this way.
So when it comes to the definition of democracy, there is no doubt that it involves the United States. We all know that the United States is the most representative democracy in the international community today. Xi Jinping wants to compete for the right to speak of democracy. The biggest opponent is of course the United States. In fact, Xi Jinping’s speech did indeed have an implicit response to the recent speeches of both Burns and Pompeo. In the speech of Peng Siping Pei, they all used a heavy brush to emphasize the opposition between the CCP's totalitarian system and democracy and freedom. They also all encouraged the Xi Jinping authorities to embrace democracy and freedom. Only we see that Xi Jinping’s response is very clear. His statement is: The CCP’s rule is democratic now. It is just a democratic system with the characteristics of the CCP and completely different from Western society.
Here we can see that the sophistry logic and language scams that the CCP is very good at have come in handy again. I believe that Xi Jinping himself should not be able to create this paradoxical theory. This set of things is likely to be the false theoretical pseudo-proposition of Wang Huning, a professional political makeup artist.
This brings up a problem. Although the CCP's totalitarian system has long been notoriously known as the Nazi, why does the CCP still have to seize the figuration of democracy and still have to make a lot of fuss? One of the most fundamental reasons behind this is the need for the CCP to expand and promote the soft power of the CCP model.
The CCP pledged 14 major events, one of which is to actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system. Note that the word ""reform"" here is not only to participate in global governance, but also to become a manager, because only managers have the power to carry out the new reforms, and the US-led liberal democratic global governance system is obviously the CCP. The object that I want to reform.
That is to say, Xi Jinping gave democracy a new definition of the CCP's distinctive style. The most urgent purpose is to reverse the CCP's dictatorship and the blame for the preparation of the accused quilt. He wants to use the foreign publicity to fight a public opinion war and put on the CCP's totalitarian model. A beautiful democratic outerwear package, so that it is convenient for subsequent sales.
Secondly, the CCP's totalitarian power is now beginning to show a clear trend, that is, it is getting more and more into the opposite extreme. Expressed in the language system of the party culture, it is the connotation and definition of the CCP’s increasingly unscrupulous public smuggling of universal values. For example, the basic meaning of human rights is the right to life, liberty and freedom from slavery, torture, freedom of speech and property. This is recognized worldwide and written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, the CCP has publicly distorted this definition and said that China’s national conditions are different. The CCP’s understanding of human rights is the right to subsistence and development. In this way, it is equal to the moral and social attributes of the human beings who are the most important in human rights. And the humanities and philosophical attributes have all been divested, and human rights have become a simple animal attribute. Just letting you live is to protect your human rights.
Zhang Xiaoming, former director of the Liaison Office, publicly told democrats during the umbrella movement: You are allowed to live, and it has already shown the central tolerance - why a senior official said such a murderous anti-human language, he felt very Naturally, I didn't feel anything wrong. It shows that in the CCP's violently constructed system, this concept of distortion and tampering has become very popular and even deep in the system.
As can be seen from this example, the CCP regards the people as animals. The concept of brainwashing is that if you have to eat and drink, you can live, and the party has not slaughtered you at will, even if you have human rights. As for the other, the right to freedom of speech, property or assembly, etc., are not within the definition of the party's human rights. Therefore, we can see that the CCP can still arbitrarily persecute Falun Gong practitioners, persecute Xinjiang ethnic minorities, and various rights activists and dissidents, and still have the courage to openly say that China’s human rights situation is at its best in history, even more than the United States. Fortunately five times and so on. Many people will think that these officials are not abnormal. Actually, it is not because the CCP has distorted the definition of human rights. It has also spawned a set of fallacies. Of course, it has become a tool for the CCP to rationalize and legalize human rights violations. .
From this perspective, Xi Jinping's whole process of democracy is also an inevitable outcome of the same party cultural mechanism. Is the CCP a democracy? This can be said to be an IQ problem. Any normal person will think that Xi Jinping’s statement is too ridiculous, but he will tell you that the CCP’s definition of democracy is like this. The definition of democracy that you have understood before is the old past tense of the West. Now the definition of the CCP is a new definition, also known as the definition of the CCP. I think what he wants to express is such a theme. And this similar sophistry logic has almost become a universal shield, covering up all the sins of the CCP.
In the past, if a person sinned and wanted to excuse himself, he tried to cover up the crime, falsify the evidence, and acted as if he had not done it. In the eyes of the Chinese Communists, these means are weak. The CCP is now playing at an advanced stage. They directly reverse the standard of good and evil by 180 degrees. Good is the worst and bad is the best. They will confess that they have killed or robbed money, and then manipulated public opinion and Wu Mao to tell you that such behavior is correct, revolutionary, and patriotic. Therefore, in the party culture language system, theft of intellectual property rights is not a crime, but a ""right to development."" The illegal detention of a tortured person is not a crime, but a ""rule of legal education or vocational training."" In turn, a fine or sentence is imposed on a thief. It is not called to honor justice, but to violate national sovereignty or violate human rights.
There are many similar examples, such as not interfering in internal affairs, one country, two systems, and the Sino-British statement is a historical document, etc., the CCP is playing with such a set of twisted connotations. Any CCP’s unfavorable allegations, the CCP’s current response is to directly claim that the definitions of these allegations are wrong, and that they have their own new definitions. The CCP does not know where to come. Many anti-intelligence, anti-conventional, and anti-human claims are often endorsed by the government. This may be the source of the CCP’s so-called theoretical self-confidence and road self-confidence.
Once such scams are widely used, we can see that the CCP has a distinct feature, that is, what is said and actually done, is the opposite and completely opposite. So many friends may think of this, that is, Xi Jinping said that the CCP is now the most democratic, and it is the whole process of democracy. Is it true that he is doing the opposite, is the dictatorship of the whole process?
Yes, it seems to me that his speech does have such a signal in it. That is to say, when the CCP begins to emphasize what it means, it often means that it is going to do what is going in the opposite direction. A more obvious evidence is that we see that while Xi Jinping said that the CCP is a whole process of democracy, the Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi shouted the slogan of ""Public Security Names Party"" at the meeting of the public security system to convey the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session. .
Of course, everyone knows that the public security system has never had a nameless party. From the Yan’an era, the public security system has been the party’s knife and has not changed. Therefore, I think Zhao Kezhi’s real meaning is that the police are surnamed, the party is not abstract, and the party is now Xi Jinping. Therefore, he deliberately called the public security surname party, obviously to express the signal to support Xi Jinping's further centralization to the individual. Zhao Kezhi is a close-knit confidant of Xi Jinping. It is Xi Jiajun. Whether he is taking the lead in demonstrating whether he can drive a wave of appearances needs to be observed, but it is further centralized, and further accomplishing that you are a grass-root, I dominate all CCP-style democracy. This signal is very clear.
Finally, I would like to add a point: Xi Jinping’s formulation of the whole process of democracy is the first time that it should be said that it should be rendered by the party media, “the theoretical innovation of the new era”, etc., but in fact only Xinhua’s micro-evaluation has been issued. A small commentary set off, and the major party media did not publish this passage. I don't think this is anything. Wang Huning is too bold to give Xi Jinping a plane and dare to delete his most important speech. This is more like a meticulous arrangement, the purpose is not to let Xi Jinping's speech that subverts people's common sense and cognition cause too much shock.
Because of this speech, it is said that it is a bit serious, and it directly points to the definition of the values of the foundation of the United States. If the propaganda system is greatly rendered, it may trigger a conflict between Chinese and American values that is more serious than the NBA incident. The reality is that China and the United States are in a sensitive period of negotiation. Xi Jinping does not have to and does not want to provoke a battle for values with the United States at this time. Therefore, he needs a set of statements to respond to Burns and Pompeo, including responding to the international community, but not wanting to be too high-profile to cause counter-effects. Therefore, the biggest reason for the party media not to publish is probably just to not stimulate the United States and avoid self-defeating. .
Ok, today's discussion is here for the time being. Thank you for watching. I welcome your comments and comments, and like them. Thank you all.
