      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 6 — Some 4,000 people were evacuated from the Century Square shopping mall in Tampines after a fire broke out there in late yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SDCF) said that the fire, which occurred on the third floor of the mall, was linked to a floor-cleaning machine.</p>
      <p>An online directory shows that a food court is located on the third floor of the mall.</p>
      <p>There were no reported injuries and that the cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
      <p>SCDF said that it had responded to the fire at about 4.15pm, but it was extinguished by the sprinklers before the arrival of its officers.</p>
      <p>It added that shoppers and workers in the building were then evacuated as a “precautionary measure”.</p>
      <p>Videos circulating on social media showed scores of people taking the escalators and leaving the building as firefighters controlled the situation. The atrium was lightly filled with smoke.</p>
      <p>On its Facebook page, Century Square said that a fire had broken out at The Food Market at about 4.10pm.</p>
      <p>Tenants of the building were allowed to re-enter the mall from 5.45pm to “start the cleaning up process,” Century Square said in a later update.</p>
      <p>However, The Food Market food court will “remain closed until further notice,” the mall said. — TODAY</p>
