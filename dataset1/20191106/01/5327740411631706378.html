      <h2>Charges stem from investigation by the Provincial Integrated Child Exploitation Unit</h2>

      <p>A firefighter in Squamish is facing two child pornography charges following an investigation by the RCMP’s Provincial Integrated Child Exploitation Unit.</p>
      <p>John Taavo Martin, 43, has been charged with possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography, Mounties said in a news release Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The charges step from a search warrant executed on June 27, 2019, after police received information from the National Centre for Mission and Exploited Children, a non-profit organization that works to find missing children and prevent child victimization.</p>
      <p>Martin was later arrested and has since been released on a number of conditions ahead of his next court appearance set for later this month.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if Martin is still a firefighter for the city. Black Press Media has reached out to the Squamish Fire Department for comment.</p>
