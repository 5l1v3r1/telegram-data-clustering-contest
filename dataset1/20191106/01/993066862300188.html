      <p>THE SDLP's Claire Hanna is odds-on favourite to take the South Belfast Westminster seat from the DUP, according to one bookmaker.</p>
      <p>Within 24 hours of Sinn Féin <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/generalelection/2019/11/04/news/sinn-fe-in-will-not-contest-election-in-three-seats-1756091/">stepping aside to help the SDLP's pro-Remain candidate</a> oust sitting DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly, the odds on victory for Ms Hanna narrowed to 2/9.</p>
      <p>Notably, bookmaker Paddy Power has Alliance's Paula Bradshaw as second favourite to take the seat, with Ms Little-Pengelly drifting to 6/1.</p>
      <p>The money also appears to favour an SDLP victory in Foyle, where party leader Colum Eastwood is seeking to unseat Sinn Féin's Elisha McCallion.</p>
