THE SDLP's Claire Hanna is odds-on favourite to take the South Belfast Westminster seat from the DUP, according to one bookmaker.
Within 24 hours of Sinn Féin stepping aside to help the SDLP's pro-Remain candidate oust sitting DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly, the odds on victory for Ms Hanna narrowed to 2/9.
Notably, bookmaker Paddy Power has Alliance's Paula Bradshaw as second favourite to take the seat, with Ms Little-Pengelly drifting to 6/1.
The money also appears to favour an SDLP victory in Foyle, where party leader Colum Eastwood is seeking to unseat Sinn Féin's Elisha McCallion.
