      <p>For the most part, Drake has kept his 2-year-old son Adonis away from the spotlight. He hasn't shared and pictures or photos of him —until now. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/lyrics-about-drakes-son-on-scorpion-finally-confirm-all-those-rumors-in-emotional-way-9629264">Drake's Instagram Story photo is a glimpse at his son Adonis</a>, but the baby's face isn't actually shown. On Nov. 4, the rapper posted a photo on his Instagram Story of Adonis wearing socks that say "I [heart] Daddy." It's the most that fans have seen of Adonis and it won't remain on Drake's profile for long, since Instagram Stories disappear in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Adonis has lived a pretty private life. Fans didn't even know he existed until <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/pusha-ts-diss-track-about-drake-has-fans-antsy-for-even-more-drama-to-unfold-9240739">Pusha T released a diss track called "The Story of Adidon"</a> in May 2018. In the track aimed at Drake, he rapped, "You are hiding a child / Let that boy come home." Drake didn't immediately respond to song, but<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIXhOXfx-qY"> he eventually admit he had a son</a> when he released the track "Emotionless" on June 29, 2018. In the song, Drake's lyrics said, "I wasn’t hidin’ my kid from the world / I was hidin’ the world from my kid.”</p>
      <p>The rapper has continued to keep his son out of the public eye, but Drake did discuss <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/drake-reveals-why-he-walked-away-from-pusha-t-and-kanye-beef.html">co-parenting with Adonis' mom Sophie Brussaux</a> during an October 2018 interview with <i>Vulture</i>. The <i>Degrassi: The Next Generation </i>alum said, "I do want to be able to explain to my son what happened, but I don't have any desire for him to not love his mother." In that same interview, he discussed that he wants his child to have a good relationship with his mother, even if they aren't in romantic relationship with each other. Drake said, "We found ourselves in a situation and we're both equally responsible and now I'm just excited to be a father."</p>

      <p>Drake has shown his excitement about being a father several times on IG. In a December 2018 Instagram post, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br14IZ6ARMs/?utm_source=ig_embed">Drake said "Adonis &gt; Picasso don’t @ me"</a> in the caption for a framed finger painting that his son made. On June 16, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Byx0zz9gAvb/?utm_source=ig_embed">Drake shared a painting that Adonis</a> made for Father's Day<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Byx0zz9gAvb/?utm_source=ig_embed">.</a></p>

      <p>So far, Drake has shared Adonis' art and his leg on Instagram. As happy as Drake seems to be a father, he has kept his son's face and other personal parts of his life under wraps.</p>
