      <p>Malaysian authorities have detained two Cambodian opposition activists while they were waiting to board a flight to Thailand in what is seen as part of a crackdown on exiled dissidents in Southeast Asia, a rights groups said late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/malaysia.html">Malaysia</a>, along with Vietnam, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cambodia.html">Cambodia</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/thailand.html">Thailand</a>, have been accused by rights groups of detaining and returning critics of neighbouring governments, even those with political refugee status with the United Nations.</p>
      <p>The two Cambodians, who include an asylum seeker, were detained on Monday night and were to be deported to their home country the following afternoon.</p>
      <p>Malaysia's home ministry and immigration department withdrew the order after an appeal, said Jerald Joseph of the Malaysian Human Rights Commission.</p>

      <p>"Right now we are trying to visit them in detention as well as determine their status. But we are glad the ministry chose not to deport, I think that's a good sign," Jerald, a commissioner at the agency, told the Reuters news agency.</p>
      <p>Jerald said they did not know on what grounds the initial deportation order was issued.</p>
      <p>Malaysia's home ministry, immigration department and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees did not respond to requests for comment. Malaysia's foreign ministry declined to comment.</p>
      <h3>Risks of rights violations</h3>
      <p>Human Rights Watch deputy director for Asia, Phil Robertson, said the two detainees are members of the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) that has been outlawed by Cambodian Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/cambodia-hun-sen-set-election-largely-unopposed-poll-180728214254373.html">Hun Sen</a>'s government.</p>
      <p>Rights group Amnesty International said sending the two Cambodians back could put them at "risk of serious human rights violations".</p>
      <p>"We call on the authorities to immediately release the two opposition activists and ensure they are not deported back to Cambodia where they face arbitrary arrest and detention," Amnesty said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Reuters was not immediately able to contact Cambodian authorities.</p>
      <p>Cambodia has arrested at least 48 opposition activists this year for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government before the planned return from self-exile of Sam Rainsy, founder of the dissolved CNRP, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen's government deployed troops along its borders in response to Rainsy's announcement of his planned return.</p>
      <p>Rainsy fled to France four years ago following a conviction for criminal defamation in which he was ordered to pay $1m in compensation. He also faces a five-year prison sentence in a separate case.</p>
      <p>He has previously said it was legitimate to seek to topple Hun Sen because the prime minister has created a one-party state and was not prepared to hold free and fair elections.</p>
