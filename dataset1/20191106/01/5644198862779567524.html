      <p>LOS ANGELES: Atlanta Hawks ace John Collins has been suspended for 25 games after testing positive for a growth hormone, the NBA said on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old power forward was hit with a suspension after growth hormone releasing peptide 2 (GHRP-2) was found in his system, the league said in a statement.</p>

      <p>The suspension is effective immediately, meaning Collins will miss Atlanta's clash with the San Antonio Spurs later Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I understand the impact this matter has on what we are trying to achieve together this season, and I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed in myself for putting all us in this position," Collins said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"I have always been incredibly careful about what I put in my body, but I took a supplement, which unbeknownst to me, had been contaminated with an illegal component," added Collins, who has averaged 17 points and 8.8 rebounds per game this season.</p>
      <p>Collins' suspension comes just weeks after Phoenix Suns center Deandre Ayton was banned for 25 games for testing positive for a diuretic.</p>
      <p>In August, Brooklyn Nets veteran Wilson Chandler was hit with a 25-game suspension for testing positive for Ipamorelin, another form of growth hormone.</p>
      <p>The NBA, like most other major professional US sports leagues, is not a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code, instead running its own anti-doping programme.</p>
