KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): theedgemarkets.com highlighted five stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. One stock displayed positive momentum while four had negative momentum.
The stock with positive momentum was :
EG Industries Bhd - up one sen at 47.5 sen
Stocks with negative momentum were:
AT Systematization Bhd - up 0.5 sen at eight sen
DGB Asia Bhd - up one sen at 17 sen
Homeritz Corp Bhd - up one sen at 70.5 sen
Velesto Energy Bhd - up three sen at 39 sen
The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.
This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.
The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.
However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.
