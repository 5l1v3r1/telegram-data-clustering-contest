星狮集团：鲜奶将成为新增长支柱
06 Nov 2019, 05:52 by Esther Lee
（吉隆坡6日讯）星狮集团（Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd）表示，鲜奶将成为其新的增长支柱，因其计划收购玻璃市Ladang Chuping种植园，把业务多元化至综合奶牛养殖。
目前，牛奶仅为星狮集团的总营业额作出低单位数贡献。星狮集团总执行长林友和今日在星狮集团截至2019年9月杪财年媒体与分析员汇报会上表示，经过两年的研究，该集团打算进军奶牛和农作物综合养殖市场。
他指出，由于本地新鲜牛奶供应不足，大马的农场牛奶价格是世界上最高的之一。除此之外，进口牛奶还受到严格的固打控制，产品还被征收20%进口税。
他说：“这表明大马消费者被剥夺了可负担优质新鲜牛奶，这是许多国家的基本商品。”
他预计，第一盒新鲜牛奶将在项目启动后的24个月内推出。
他表示，将在收购Ladang Chuping地皮后，公布更多相关详情。
截至早盘休市，星狮集团涨22仙或0.63%，至35.28令吉，约2万股成交。

Star Lion Group: Fresh milk will become the pillar of new growth
06 Nov 2019, 05:52 by Esther Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (April 6) -- Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd said that fresh milk will be its new growth pillar as it plans to acquire the Ladang Chuping plantation in the glass market and diversify its business into integrated dairy farming.
At present, milk contributes only to the total turnover of the Star Lion Group. Lin Shi, Chief Executive Officer of Xingshi Group, said today that the Group intends to enter the dairy and crop comprehensive breeding market after two years of research at the Stars Group's media and analysts' report for the fiscal year ending September 2019.
He pointed out that Malaysia's farm milk price is one of the highest in the world due to insufficient local fresh milk supply. In addition, imported milk is subject to strict solid control, and the product is also subject to a 20% import tax.
He said: ""This shows that Malaysian consumers have been deprived of affordable high-quality fresh milk, which is a basic commodity in many countries.""
He predicted that the first box of fresh milk will be launched within 24 months of the start of the project.
He said that more details will be announced after the acquisition of Ladang Chuping land.
As of the close of the market, the Star Lion Group rose 22 sen or 0.63% to RM35.28, and about 20,000 shares were sold.
