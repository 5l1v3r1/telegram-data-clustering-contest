ABC’s Live in Front of a Studio Audience to Ring in the Holidays
06 Nov 2019, 05:10 by Charu Sinha
ABC’s Live in Front of a Studio Audience, which, as the name suggests, recreates classic sitcoms in front of a live studio audience, will be back on December 18 with new episodes of All in the Family and Good Times. The special will feature holiday episodes, as we predicted back in August. All in the Family was one of the shows featured in the debut of LIFOASA back in May, which also included an episode of The Jeffersons. This time around, Kerry Washington will join as an executive producer alongside Jimmy Kimmel, Norman Lear, Justin Theroux, Brent Miller, and Will Ferrell. The debut of LIFOASA garnered huge ratings and an Emmy win for Norman Lear, who became the oldest-ever person to win an Emmy award. Casting announcements for the December episodes have not yet been announced.
