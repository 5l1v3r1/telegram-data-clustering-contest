      <h1>Teens Are Posting Pics Of The Fake Halloween Outfits They Used To Fool Their Strict Parents</h1>

      <p>If you grew up with strict parents, you know the struggle of trying to get away with wearing the actually fun Halloween outfit you really want.</p>
      <p>And Trisha, a college student from UCLA, is no stranger to this.</p>
      <p>For Halloween this year Trisha decided that she wanted to go as a referee, with a bit of a twist. But before setting off for the night and wearing the outfit she had planned, she snapped a photo of the original costume and sent it to her dad.</p>
      <p>She then uploaded her real costume, and the one her parents saw onto Twitter, where it went viral.</p>

      <p>For Trisha‚Äôs actual outfit, she cut her shirt and switched to shorts, while her parents thought she wore the t-shirt and leggings combo she sent them prior.</p>
      <p>For the record, her dad thought the look was ‚Äúvery nice üëç‚Äù.</p>
      <p>After getting over 400,000 likes in a day, the tweet inspired other other teens with equally strict parents to share their photos too.</p>

      <p>Some even did almost full outfit changes after taking a snap for mum and dad.</p>

      <p>And others even went so far as to draw on fake shirts to help fool their unsuspecting parents.</p>

      <p>While<a href="https://twitter.com/JOSIEBADASS/status/1191358517849968641?s=20"> one Twitter user suggested</a> Trisha make her account private in case her parents saw her tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/trishasucks/status/1191401511009452035?s=20">she replied</a>: ‚Äúgirl the damage has been done, I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall in my next life.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Ah, teens. They‚Äôre just like you and me.</p>
