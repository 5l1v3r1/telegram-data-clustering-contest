國民黨總統候選人韓國瑜遭週刊爆料，在2011年無業期間購入台北市南港區高達7,200萬的豪宅，引起不少人質疑他過去主打的「庶民」形象。民進黨立委王定宇今（6）日也po文狠酸韓國瑜，「7,200萬豪宅的假庶民現形了，還有財源來路不明的大問題喔！」
過去經常以「庶民」形象自稱的韓國瑜，這回卻遭《壹週刊》踢爆，指他在2011年失業狀況下，出手購買位於南港高達近7,200萬元的豪宅，更直指韓國瑜妻子李佳芬當時還組成「貴婦購屋團」下訂，此舉讓外界質疑財產來源，甚至重創韓國瑜努力打造的「庶民」形象。

對此，立委王定宇稍早於臉書po文談論此事，狠酸韓國瑜「難怪上週日沒行程、只有洗內褲…」「7,200萬豪宅的假庶民現形了，還有財源來路不明的大問題喔！」王定宇更以其7成貸款估算，若貸款5,050萬元按照現行房貸利率，本金加利息每月得負擔約30萬元，質疑「每個月的貸款，錢哪來的？」「如果他沒有貸款，7,200萬的資金從哪來的？」王定宇最後再提近日「卡韓」事件，「如果連尿尿的事都能不老實，還有什麼不能騙？難怪連中學生都知道問『為什麼愛說謊』！」
韓國瑜遭爆買豪宅消息曝光後，也引起許多PTT鄉民討論留言，「拜託！！庶民是不可以買豪宅炒房嗎？」「有白紙黑字說庶民不能買豪宅嗎！」「交屋前賣掉？是不是炒房阿？」「在座各位沒有7200萬的都是賤民。」

South Korea’s Yu was hit by 72 million to buy a mansion. Wang Dingyu: The fake people are now

The Kuomintang presidential candidate, Yuki Yuki, broke the news that he bought a luxury home of 72 million in Nangang District of Taipei during his unemployed period in 2011, causing many people to question the image of his ""untouchables"". Wang Dingyu, the legislator of the DPP, today (6) also has a poem of South Korea, ""The fake people of the 72 million mansions are now in shape, and there are big problems with unknown sources of money!""
In the past, Korean Yu, who used to be a self-proclaimed ""untouchable"" image, was kicked out by ""Weekly Weekly"". He said that he bought a luxury home in Nangang with a total of nearly 72 million yuan in the unemployment situation in 2011. At the time, Li Jiafen also formed a ""Grandma Buying House"", which allowed the outside world to question the source of the property and even hit the image of ""the people"" that South Korea Yu strives to create.

In this regard, the legislator Wang Dingyu talked about this matter a little earlier than the Facebook essay, sputum Korean Yu ""no wonder there was no itinerary on Sunday, only washing underwear..."" ""The fake people of the 72 million mansion are now in shape, and there is still a source The big problem is 喔!"" Wang Dingyu estimates the loan of 70%. If the loan is 50.5 million yuan, according to the current mortgage interest rate, the principal plus interest will cost about 300,000 yuan per month, questioning ""every month's loan, where is the money?"" ""If he does not have a loan, where does the 72 million yuan come from?"" Wang Dingyu finally raised the recent ""Kanhan"" incident. ""If you can't even pee, can you lie? What is it that even middle school students?"" I all know, ""Why love to lie!""
After the exposure of the Korean pop-up luxury home news, many PTT villagers also discussed the message. ""Please!! Can the public not buy a real estate speculation?"" ""There is a black and white saying that the people can't buy a luxury house!"" Is it real estate speculation?"" ""There are no 72 million people in the room.""
