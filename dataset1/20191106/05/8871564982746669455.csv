06 Nov 2019, 05:28 by Coconuts Bangkok
Song after song, video after video, do constant pop-up and pre-roll ads ruin the moment?
As of today, users in Southeast Asia can return to the days when YouTube was much less annoying by signing up for its premium service. YouTube Premium, formerly known as YouTube Red, officially launched this morning in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and also Hong Kong. 
YouTube Premium subscribers get ad-free entertainment that can be downloaded and watched offline, as well as songs that can be played in the background. They also get YouTube-produced originals such as Cobra Kai, the critically praised, ongoing story of The Karate Kid; murder-mystery reality series Escape the Night and Jordan Peele’s sci-fi anthology Weird City.



In Thailand, YouTube Premium starts at THB159 per month (THB159 for Android and THB209 for iOS). There is a free, one-month trial. The Family package supports up to five more “family members” in a single household for THB239 per month for Android and THB309 for iOS, also including one-month free trial.
The monthly rate starts at S$11.98 in Singapore, HK$68 in Hong Kong, IDR59,000 in Indonesia and PHP159 in the Philippines. 
Also launched today in Thailand is YouTube Music, a music-focused streaming service that provides an interface for users to browse through songs and music videos based on genres, playlists and recommendations in an attempt to rival Spotify and Apple Music.
YouTube Premium originally launched in the states as Music Key in 2014 before being relaunched as YouTube Red in 2015.
