【天亮時分】川習會在即 川普是否會降低中國商品關稅？

06 Nov 2019, 05:25

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】【天亮時分】川習會在即 川普是否會降低中國商品關稅？：彭博社和金融時報都報導說，北京要求川普降低或者取消大約3600億美元中國輸美商品的關稅，習近平才會上飛機來美國簽訂第一階段的貿易協議。
作為鴿派的商務部長羅斯沒有做出明確的回答，僅表示對中美簽署第一階段協議抱有樂觀態度。這反映出川普可能讓步。理由有三：1、可能有對中共的誤判和給習近平面子；2、美聯儲在貨幣政策上不支持貿易戰；3、簽訂協議給股市利好消息，有利川普連任。
我們用中國古代的識人術講了川普不應該讓步的理由。談到習近平會見林鄭月娥的表態對貿易戰的影響。以及川普的最佳戰略是什麼和中美誰更急於達成協議。詳細分析請見視頻。

[Daylights] Chuan Xihui is on the way Will Trump reduce the tariffs on Chinese goods?

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time on November 06, 2019] [Daylights] Chuan Xihui is on the way Will Trump reduce China's commodity tariffs? Both Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported that Beijing asked Trump to reduce or cancel the tariff of about $360 billion on Chinese exports to the US, and that Xi Jinping would board the plane to sign the first-stage trade agreement.
As the dovisive business minister, Ross did not give a clear answer, only expressed his optimism about the signing of the first phase agreement between China and the United States. This reflects Trump's possible concessions. There are three reasons: 1. There may be misjudgments to the CCP and Xi Jinfuzi; 2. The Fed does not support trade wars on monetary policy; 3. Signing agreements to give good news to the stock market, which is conducive to Trump's re-election.
We used the ancient Chinese literacy technique to explain the reasons why Trump should not give in. I talked about the impact of Xi Jinping’s meeting with Lin Zhengyue’s statement on the trade war. And what is Trump's best strategy and who is more eager to reach an agreement. See the video for a detailed analysis.
