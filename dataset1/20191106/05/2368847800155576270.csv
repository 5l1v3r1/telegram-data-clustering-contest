拒色與貪色的果報（3）

06 Nov 2019, 05:02


（三）義士免難

清代時，有一次杭州發生火災，連燒了數十家，許多官員都出動前往救火。大家看到：火中有一位金甲神，手裏拿紅旗，左右指揮，圍繞著一座住宅，火燒到那一家，便又回頭。等到火熄滅後，在瓦礫中，看見那一棟房宅孑然獨存，這是北新關吏顧某的家。當時顧某奉命到江南出差尚未回來，屋裏只剩下婦人和幾個小孩子。大家感到非常驚訝，不知道這件事情的原因。
顧某出差到江南後，把船停放在蘇州的河邊，看見一位少婦沿著河邊，邊走邊哭。顧某問她原因，她說：「我丈夫欠糧五十兩銀子，被關在監獄，我不忍心看見丈夫先死，所以想投河自盡。」顧某便從行囊中拿出五十兩銀子給了她，少婦拜謝後離去。顧某坐船回程時，又經過該地，上岸到飲食店，剛好所救的少婦家，就在對面，那位少婦看見顧某，立刻告訴丈夫，他們夫婦便請顧某到家裏，準備飯菜款待他，並且留他住宿。丈夫告訴少婦：「救命之恩，我們家貧無以為報，你陪他過夜來酬謝好了。」到了半夜，少婦來到顧某的寢室，顧某斷然拒絕了她，並且回到自己船中過夜。
顧某返家後，慰問他的人接踵而至，大家詢問他有甚麼福德，受到天神保護，竟然使家宅免於火難。顧某也說不出原因，大家一直追問，於是他想起前面那件事，人們屈指計算，跟起火的時間恰好吻合。
顧某救了夫妻倆人的命，功德極大，又拒絕了邪淫，守住名節，品節仁慈崇高，感天動地，因此上天也解救了他一家火災之難，並且眾人得見，彰顯善報。
