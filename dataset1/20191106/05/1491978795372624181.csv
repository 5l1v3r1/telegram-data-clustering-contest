Police are hunting for a 49-year-old man who fled the scene of a fatal stabbing at a construction site in St Peters

A 76-year-old man is dead and a 33-year-old man is in a critical condition after a construction site stabbing in Sydney’s inner west, with police now hunting the alleged assailant.
NSW police on Wednesday afternoon said they were searching for a 49-year-old construction worker who fled the scene of the stabbing at St Peters.



Inspector Chad Deegenaars said the three men knew each other.
“Police and ambulance on arrival found a 76-year-old man deceased and it appears a 33-year-old man was also suffering stab wounds,” he said.
“Attempts to render first aid were made to both parties. Unfortunately, the 76-year-old man could not be revived.”
The 33-year-old was taken to Royal Prince Alfred hospital in a critical condition and underwent surgery.
Detectives don’t believe it was a random attack, Deegenaars said.
“Our investigators are finding out what the disagreement was. What the motive was, we don’t know.”
Emergency services were called to the construction site on the Princes Highway about 1pm.
The alleged attacker was described as Caucasian, 180cm tall and with a shaved head. He was wearing a high-vis yellow shirt and long blue work pants.
Police have warned the public not to approach the man if they see him but to instead call triple zero.
Sydneysiders were urged to stay away from the intersection of Short Street and the Princes Highway.
Video from the scene, posted to Twitter, shows a number of men in high-vis clothing standing in an area roped off by crime-scene tape.
