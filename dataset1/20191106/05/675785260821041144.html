      <p>West Yorkshire Police, Chief Superintendent Damien Miller said: “In conjunction with our partner agencies, we have prepared for all possible eventualities over the bonfire period.</p>
      <p>“We made it clear from the outset that any instances of disorder or antisocial behaviour would not be tolerated and we were able to quickly respond.</p>
      <p>“Those individuals that engage in such behaviour are within the minority and do not represent the wider community.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to provide reassurance in the local area with high visibility patrols.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information as to those responsible is asked to contact the non-emergency number 101 quoting reference 1932 of 05/11.</p>
