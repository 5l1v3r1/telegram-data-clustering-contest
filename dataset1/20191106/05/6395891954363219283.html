      <p><b>SACRAMENTO, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - California's Supreme Court is considering whether President Donald Trump must disclose his tax returns if he wants to be a candidate in the state's primary election next spring.</p>
      <p>The high court is set to hear arguments Wednesday, although a federal judge already temporarily blocked the state law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns to run in California's primary.</p>
      <p>The justices sped up their usual timetable because the deadline to file tax returns for California's March 3 presidential primary would be Nov. 26 if the law survives. But the state's appeal of the federal judge's order will extend past that deadline.</p>
      <p>The justices' consideration comes the same week that a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Trump's tax returns can be turned over to state criminal investigators.</p>
