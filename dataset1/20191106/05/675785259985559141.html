      <h1>UK weather forecast: Three weeks of rain fall in a day as floods could cut off homes</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for tomorrow and Friday, with up to 80mm of rain expected</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T05:18:12+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 05:18</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Some parts of Britain could be cut off by floodwater later this week as almost three weeks of rain falls in 24 hours, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> warns.</p>
      <p>The organisations has issued a rain <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for north-east England from 6am tomorrow to 6am on Friday.</p>
      <p>Up to 80mm of rain could hit parts of Yorkshire, bringing almost three quarters of the 121mm average rain total for November in one day.</p>
      <p>The Met Office alert says there is a chance some communities could become cut off by flooded roads, in addition to potential public transport disruption.</p>
      <p>The warning states: "Rain, prolonged and occasionally heavy, will affect much of Yorkshire, along with parts of northeast of England and the north Midlands during Thursday.</p>

      <p>"The rain will gradually ease overnight and clear away during the early hours of Friday.</p>
      <p>"20-40 mm of rain is expected over quite a wide area, with 60-80 mm falling in a few locations over high ground, through the period."</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency said flooding is possible - but not expected - on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>A flooding forecast by the organisation states: "Widespread surface water and river flooding is possible but not expected on Thursday and Friday as rain falls on already wet ground across parts of the north of England, the Midlands and Lincolnshire.</p>
      <p>"Local flooding is also possible more widely across the Midlands, East Anglia and the north of England. Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption."</p>
