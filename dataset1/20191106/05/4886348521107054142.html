      <p>The decentralized app (Dapp) market continues to grow by leaps and bounds, with the past year seeing no let-up in new Dapp use case scenarios. Since this time last year, Dapps have now made up over 1 billion transactions totaling over $10 billion in volume.</p>
      <p>And the majority of this is thanks to gaming and gambling Dapps, which still are popular with users, raking in the lion’s share of revenue in the Dapp market.</p>
      <p>And now, Curacao-based EarnBet — the original Dapp casino formerly branded as EOSBet — celebrates 19 months of successful operations, providing the provably fair gaming experience that crypto gamers have come to love via a decentralized platform that rewards all players generously for their interaction.</p>
      <h3>Setting Records Every Day</h3>
      <p>With a house edge that is the envy of the industry, <a href="http://earnbet.io/">EarnBet.io</a> boasts over 27 million bets since 2018 and has paid out over $377 million to winners. Of this, BET holders have received over $4 million in instant dividends directly to their wallets.</p>
      <p>After a listing on Binance DEX and Newdex, BET tokens were available not just through gameplay but also on the open market, with a perpetual buyback resulting in over <a href="http://earnbet.io/">500,000 BET already destroyed</a> to lower supply by about 1.5%.</p>
      <p>Every wager received gives BET tokens out to players, entitling them a <a href="http://earnbet.io/">share of gaming profits</a>, with every single crypto every made in profit distributed fully to all BET holders.</p>
      <p>When the crypto market looked for a professional platform that was also operational, it needed one that showcased every aspect of blockchain technology, in particular, its transparency, decentralization, and immutability.</p>
      <p>EarnBet has so far proven to be that platform.</p>
      <h3>A legend among Dapps</h3>
      <p>EarnBet is now known as one of<a href="http://earnbet.io/"> the biggest Dapp launches</a> in history, surpassing every benchmark on the Bitcoin network and every Ethereum Dapp ever built, when launching on the EOS mainnet.</p>
      <p>And not even 12 months after launch, EarnBet already noted significant accomplishments and development objectives, by being the first platform built on the EOSIO blockchain to be a commercial success, and also the first on-chain casino to be awarded a Gaming License.</p>
      <p>The recipe for success lies in its simplicity and ease of use, for a great experience of gaming for all users. Using EarnBet gives you all the blockchain edge, without the tech hassle. Instant deposits and instant withdrawals are accompanied by <a href="http://earnbet.io/">frictionless onboarding</a> process.  And late last year, its new decentralized accounting let signups happen within a few clicks. </p>
      <p>Forget wallets, 3rd party software, transaction fees, or staking resources. Everything is easy and you never have to lose control of your funds.</p>
      <p>And now, stepping outside EOS, bettors can choose major crypto like BTC, BCH, LTC, and ETH, with more in the pipeline. With a sixth game due to be announced before 2019 is over, there is plenty in store for EarnBet players.</p>
      <h3>Future Developments</h3>
      <p>With two new games planned by December 2019, and new revenue streams to and functionality upcoming for BET tokens, token holders have much to be excited about.</p>
      <p>Marketing will also expand to touch other crypto communities, focusing on taking in new users with broad campaigns, such as the <a href="http://earnbet.io/">limited-time promotion giving 50 BET tokens to all new users signing up</a>.</p>
