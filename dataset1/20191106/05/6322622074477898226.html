      <p>TOKYO (Nov 6): Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp said on Wednesday it will shut down a Singapore unit that trades crude oil and petroleum products after alleging earlier that a trader racked up US$320 million of losses in unauthorised trading.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi said the unit, Petro-Diamond Singapore, "has confirmed after closing the positions concerned, it will realize a loss of approximately 34.2 billion yen (US$314 million) before taxes, which could put the subsidiaries final debt as high as 30.8 billion yen."</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi Corp, Japan's biggest trading house by sales, said in September the trader at Petro-Diamond had lost US$320 million through unauthorised transactions in crude oil derivatives and that the matter had been reported to the police.</p>
      <p>The trader later denied wrongdoing in a statement issued through a lawyer.</p>
