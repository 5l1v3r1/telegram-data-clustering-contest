        <b>MPs decided to dissolve the Parliament, officially announcing it at midnight Tuesday. Both the government and the opposition pressed for the new elections to avoid a stalemate during the upcoming divorce process with the European Union.</b>

      <p>British Queen Elizabeth II has agreed to hold early parliamentary elections, <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20191106/1077235911.html">Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet has repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911061077233295-uk-parliament-dissolved-whats-to-come-in-the-next-25-days/">called for an early vote during the recent Brexit crisis,</a> as Parliament was unable to agree on a deal, negotiated by PM Johnson. The opposition Labour Party, however, demanded to ask the bloc for another extension and refused to back a snap vote before it's done.</p>
      <p>Following a series of talks, London asked for a new delay, postponing the Brexit deadline until January 2020.</p>
