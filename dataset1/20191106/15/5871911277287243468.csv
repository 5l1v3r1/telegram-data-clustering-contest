The Betting Window for November 8-10
06 Nov 2019, 15:15 by Luke Irwin
 
Here at Undercard Superstar, we’re in the business of your business! Just follow our sound betting advice, and you too can refer to yourself as self-sheltered after my betting advice leaves you without a home!
As usual, we’ll take a hundred dollars and divide it among five fights.
Let’s make some cashola.
 


Alexander Volkov -280 over Greg Hardy ($35)


Zabit Magomedsharipov -285 over Calvin Kattar ($20)


Rustam Khabilov -170 over Sergey Khandozhko ($10)


KSI +160 over Logan Paul ($5)


Grigorii Popov -205 over Davey Grant ($30)


 
A failsafe is that if Hardy finds himself in trouble, he’ll find a way to get himself DQ’d or turn it into a no-contest, so you’re bound to at least break even! Heavy money!
Magomedsharipov, much like his Dagestanian fighting brothers are icy-cold brutally efficient war machines, not to ever be confused with War Machine.
 

Last Week: $ +5.53

Year To Date: $ -128.31

 

-All lines courtesy of Bovada at time of wager.
