      <p>World Cup winners the Springboks have been taking turns posting pictures of themselves with the Webb Ellis Cup, which touched down in South Africa on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Captain <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/springboks-humbled-by-superb-support-on-arrival-in-sa-20191105">Siya Kolisi</a>, smiling from ear to ear, led the core of the senior management team into a packed and boisterous OR Tambo International Airport, holding the trophy aloft.</p>
      <p>During its travels from Japan, the trophy has seen its fair share of attention, from being used as an honorary drinking cup to being <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/handre-pollard-sleeps-with-webb-ellis-cup-20191105">cuddled</a> by Springboks vice-captain Handre Pollard.</p>
      <p>It didn’t stop with Pollard, however, as a photo has now emerged of 2019 World Rugby Coach of the Year, Rassie Erasmus hugging the trophy, nicknamed "Bill", while asleep on the plane back to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Webb Ellis trophy becomes the second cup the Boks have won this year, with a Rugby Championship silverware in the cabinet as well. The two trophies are a welcomed boost to SA Rugby's cabinet, which has gone from bare to being filled with two trophies in three months.</p>

      <p>And in keeping with theme of not letting the trophy out of sight, Bok scrumhalf Cobus Reinach on Wednesday tweeted a photo of him and teammates Willie le Roux and World Rugby Player of the Year, Pieter-Steph du Toit, having breakfast with the trophy in plain sight, captioned: "Just your average everyday breakfast".</p>

      <p>The next bit of business for the Boks will be their five-day trophy <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/springboks-bus-parade-heres-where-to-catch-a-glimpse-of-the-world-champions-20191105">parade</a>, which begins in Pretoria on Thursday and ends in Cape Town on Monday.</p>
