An idiot was caught driving a large tractor on a busy Plymouth roundabout while off his face on cocaine.
Luke Honey, aged 23, put others at risk driving badly while four times the legal limit for the drug on the Leigham interchange over the A38, a court heard.
He was banned from the road and handed a suspended prison sentence by city magistrates.
Honey pleaded guilty to driving a John Deere tractor on the Leigham Roundabout with greater than the specified limit of benzoylecgonine in his blood.

The chemical is produced as cocaine is absorbed in the system.
He had more than 200 micrograms of the drug in 100 millilitres of blood when he was stopped on May 3. The legal limit is 50.
Magistrates ruled that a custodial sentence was necessary because of the high level of the drug.
The bench ruled that he had driven a large tractor over a long distance and there was evidence of bad driving.
Honey, of Kelly near Lifton on the Devon and Cornwall border, was handed an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months.
He was disqualified from driving for 30 months and ordered to pay £115 victim surcharge.
