Clark Gable is the King of Hollywood. ‚†Ä The sex symbol of the 30‚Äì40s was born on February 1, 1901 in the city of Cadiz, Ohio. Clark's mother died of an epileptic seizure a few months after his birth. The father of William Henry Gable and his second wife, Jenny Dunlap, raised the boy. ‚†Ä Stepmom Jenny instilled in Clark a love of music, making him the youngest member in a city orchestra. True, his father was not particularly enthusiastic and believed that his son was growing slobbery and that he needed to do male affairs. ‚†Ä When Clark was 16 years old the family had financial difficulties and in order to somehow help the family, he dropped out of school and got a job at the factory. At this time, the future Hollywood symbol was not working for anyone. –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç Newspaper seller, lumberjack, telephone line operator, stage handyman. He undertook any work, but once having tried himself as an actor, he understood what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. True, the first time it came out to put it mildly not entirely successfully üòÖ He had the role of a black cook. The director did not appreciate the game in the play and sent it back to work behind the scenes. ‚†Ä But nonetheless, things gradually began to improve. Father began to sell oil again, and Clark, 23, managed to meet and marry the experienced Broadway actress Josephine Dillon, who was only 14 years older. ‚†Ä It was she who taught him the intricacies of the profession. It helped to put the voice, pronunciation and most importantly - gave valuable advice on how to get used to the role. ‚†Ä He received his first experience in cinema in 1923. The role was so small that the name of the actor was not even placed in the credits. But Clark did not give up, and thanks to his wife, he was still able to sign a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer. This event was followed by the popularity and nickname King of Hollywood. A wave of success swept the young actor and he filed for divorce. True, they say that their relationship was only platonic. ‚†Ä And a week after the divorce in 1931, Clark married a second time to Mary Langam, who was 17 years older. Her obscene wealth helped the young actor debut on Broadway. Gable himself said ""the older the woman, the more she saw and knows the modest young girls"" ‚†Ä For the first 10 years of his career, the artist played the same roles of villains and treacherous seducers of other people's wives. Later, this role became boring and he began to refuse such roles. ‚†Ä True, the bosses did not like the artist‚Äôs whims and they obliged him to play along with Claudette Colbert in the comedy ‚ÄúIt happened one night.‚Äù The tape was shot in a small, unknown studio and did not predict a large fee. But time has shown that Clark resisted in vain. This role brought him an Oscar award statuette and the opportunity to change his role. ‚†Ä Until 1939, the actor played 17 more film roles üçø, and was also re-nominated for an Oscar ‚†Ä In 38 years of filming in the film Gone With the Wind brought Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh is not only success, but also immortality. ‚†Ä The period during which Clark starred in the epic saga was the happiest moment in the artist‚Äôs personal life. ‚†Ä Not only did he receive an unprecedented fee of $ 120,000 for those times, so he also really fell in love with actress Carol Lombard. Before the two of them got married, a difficult divorce process awaited them, with their former companions, but they were able to legitimize their relationship in 1939. ‚†Ä Clark said that he had nothing more to desire. Career on top of fame, near beloved wife. There were plans for children and a happy old age next to Carol. ‚†Ä Unfortunately, dreams did not come true. In 1942, the actor‚Äôs wife died in a plane crash. For days Clark lay face down on the pillow and inhaled the smell of her perfume. He tried to cope with grief in the usual way: he began to drink. Drink so that you don‚Äôt feel anything. He understood that he could not continue like this. He pulled himself together and went to war - the Second World War was on. ‚†Ä He trained as a pilot and began to make bold combat sorties against the Nazis, not fearing for his own life. Once on his plane counted 15 bullet holes. ‚†Ä Miraculously surviving, in 1943 Clark Gable returned home. He was still popular, so MGM again signed a contract with him. But the actor worked already without much enthusiasm. After the death of his wife, something broke in him. In each of the women, Clark searched for Carol. Seven years after his death, Lombard Gable married for the fourth time. His wife was actress Sylvia Ashley. The actor dreamed of becoming a father, but the young wife was not able to give birth to an heir. The couple lived on a ranch that Gable gave Lombard. The fourth marriage lasted only three years. The family broke up when Sylvia, jealous of her husband for her late lover, tried to get rid of everything that resembled Carol in the house. ‚†Ä The fifth wife of the ‚ÄúKing of Hollywood‚Äù looked very much like Lombard. Kay Williams and Clark Gable got married in 1955. The couple lived together for five years. Kay was the only one of Clark‚Äôs wives who gave birth to a child from him. ‚†Ä ‚ÄúThe King of Hollywood‚Äù passed away during the filming of ‚ÄúThe Misfits‚Äù. Gable‚Äôs partner in this project was the famous Marilyn Monroe. The actor had a heart attack a few days after the last of the scenes was shot with him. Gable died in a hospital room 11 days after hospitalization. ‚†Ä Coronary thrombosis is the official cause of death for the actor. The actor died on November 16, 1960. At the time of his death, he was 59 years old. Gable‚Äôs grave is located in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, not far from where Carol Lombard is buried.
