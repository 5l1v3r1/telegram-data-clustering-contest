      <p>Fans were also hoping that a release date would be shared for <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/stranger-things-season-4-netflix-trailers-cast-release-date-fan-theories-2525785">season 4 of <i>Stranger Things</i></a> to mark today’s events, but at the time of writing nothing has materialised.</p>
      <p>Season 4 of the show was officially confirmed back in September along with the tagline: “we’re not in Hawkins anymore,” hinting that the story will take place in settings away from the original location.</p>
      <p>In the past, Ross Duffer has said he thinks <i>Stranger Things</i> will be a four-season show, telling <i><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-duffer-brothers-upside-down-journey-to-stranger-things.html">Variety</a>, “</i>We’re thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out.”</p>
      <p>In response to the comments, the show’s executive producer Shawn Levy told <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/28/netflix-stranger-things-how-many-seasons/">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>: “Hearts were heard breaking in Netflix headquarters when the Brothers made four seasons sound like an official end, and I was suddenly getting phone calls from our actors’ agents…the truth is we’re definitely going four seasons and there’s very much the possibility of a fifth. Beyond that, it becomes I think very unlikely.”</p>
