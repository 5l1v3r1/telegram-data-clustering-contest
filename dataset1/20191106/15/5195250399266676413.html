      <h3>MG Hector has outsold some of the established models in the segment including Jeep Compass and Mahindra XUV500</h3>
      <p>MG Motor India Limited recently announced that the Hector has gone past 38,000 bookings in India and the October 2019 monthly tally stood at 3,536 units. The British brand was launched in June with good initial response as the bookings soared in no time leading to MG stopping the reservations temporarily the following month.</p>
      <p>The company re-commenced the bookings in September 2019 while the pricing was increased by up to Rs. 40,000. To meet the customer requirements, MG is starting the second shift at its manufacturing plant in Halol, Gujarat and the Hector has already been sold out till February 2020.</p>
      <p>The Hector and Seltos have made an eye-popping impact in the mid-size SUV segment and they have certainly eaten into the volumes of their competitors. The Seltos was the most sold SUV in the country in October 2019 and beat Hyundai Creta while the MG Hector did endure a good tally with MoM growth of 35%.</p>
