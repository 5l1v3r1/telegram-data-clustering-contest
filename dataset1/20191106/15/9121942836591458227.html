      <p>DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Pistons were again without Blake Griffin, Derrick Rose and Reggie Jackson on Wednesday night against the New York Knicks.</p>
      <p>Griffin hasn’t played this season because of hamstring and knee issues. Jackson, who has had back problems, has only appeared in two games. Rose got off to a fine start in his first season with Detroit, but he is sitting out a third straight game with a right hamstring strain.</p>
      <p>The Knicks are without Dennis Smith (personal reasons), Kadeem Allen (right foot strain), Elfrid Payton (right hamstring strain) and Reggie Bullock (cervical disk herniation).</p>
