        <b>The dispute was over the soundtrack's recordings</b>
      </p>
      <p>The creators of <i>This Is <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/spinal-tap">Spinal Tap</a></i> have settled their legal dispute over the film’s soundtrack recordings.</p>
      <p>Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner formally joined fellow co-creator Harry Shearer in a $400 million (£320 million) fraud lawsuit back in 2017. Shearer, who portrayed Derek Smalls in the film and stars as multiple characters in <i>The Simpsons</i>, filed the original lawsuit in October 2016.</p>

      <p>The co-creators have now come to an agreement with Universal Music Group, as <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/spinal-tap-creators-resolve-umg-dispute/077985"><i>Music Week</i></a> report. As a result, UMG will continue to dispute Spinal Tap’s recordings and the creators will eventually be given the rights to the music.</p>
      <p>Shearer said: “I must admit, from the moment we first began mediation with them to now, I’ve been impressed by UMG’s respect for creatives and their distinctive desire to seek a prompt and equitable solution to the issues.”</p>

      <p>Guest added: “It was refreshing to be treated so constructively and with such courtesy by UMG and I’m pleased we have been able to resolve this.”</p>
      <p>The initial complaint in 2016 alleged breach of contract, “fraudulent accounting” and “anti-competitive behaviour”. At the time, the co-creators of the film claimed that they had been denied “their rightful stake in the production’s profits” by Universal and Studio Canal, both of which are owned by Vivendi.</p>
      <p>The case against Studio Canal and Ron Halpern (former Studio Canal senior executive) alleging breach of contract, fraud and anticompetitive business practices is ongoing.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-spinal-tap-reunite-for-35th-anniversary-performance-featuring-elvis-costello-2482164"> Spinal Tap reunited to mark the 35th anniversary of the music mockumentary</a>. The celebration of the milestone featured a screening and Q&amp;A in New York, before the group made their return to the stage for a live acoustic show.</p>
      <p><i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>, which was released in 1984 and became a cult classic, tells of the rise and fall of the fictional British hard rock band, Spinal Tap.</p>
