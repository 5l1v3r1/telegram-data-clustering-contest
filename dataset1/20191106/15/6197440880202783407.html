      <h1>LG hilariously launches G Pad 5 10.1 w/ Android Pie and 3-year-old Snapdragon 821</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:59:51+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/01/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-review/">Some Android tablets are good</a>, but others are a complete joke. LG isn’t helping the latter with its new G Pad 5 10.1, an Android tablet running on a three-year-old chipset, which has some hilariously bad marketing images, too.</p>
      <p>It’s been a while since LG launched a tablet, but this week (via <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_g_pad_5_101_launched_with_snapdragon_821_and_8200_mah_battery-news-39963.php"><i>GSMArena</i></a>) it has debuted the G Pad 5 10.1 in Korea. The product has a design much like some of <a href="https://9to5google.com/2013/12/10/lg-g-pad-8-3-google-play-edition-now-available-starts-at-349/">its previous tablets</a> and offers a 10.1-inch FHD+ display, 8,200 mAh battery, and Android Pie, too. It’s not a terrible package, but things go downhill from there.</p>
      <p>The tablet is running on top of a Snapdragon 821 processor, the same chipset that powered the original Google Pixel smartphones in 2016. Why LG opted for this older chip is unclear, especially considering the plethora of mid-range chipsets available now that are just as powerful. That chip is paired with 4 GB of RAM and a measly 32 GB of storage, too. There’s also a fingerprint sensor on the side of the device.</p>

      <p>Pricing for the LG G Pad 5 10.1 in Korea lands at KRW 440,000. That’s a whopping $380 when converted to USD.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the worst part of this entire announcement, though, is that one of LG’s marketing images for the tablet shows an image of Microsoft’s PowerPoint, but on Windows 10. Oops.</p>
