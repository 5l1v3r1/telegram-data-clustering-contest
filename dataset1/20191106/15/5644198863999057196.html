      <p>There is no guarantee that Xerox will follow through with an offer or that one would succeed, it added.</p>
      <p>Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox has also received an informal funding commitment from a major bank, the Journal said.</p>
      <p>HP does not comment on rumors or speculation, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Xerox did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Xerox had said it will sell its 25per cent stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings , for US$2.3 billion, after investor activism scuppered a deal involving the two companies.</p>
      <p>Xerox had scrapped its US$6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year after lobbying by two of its main investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.</p>
      <p>HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division's third-quarter revenue dropping 5per cent on-year.</p>
      <p>In October, it had announced a plan to cut up to 9,000 jobs as part of a restructuring program aimed at cutting costs.</p>
