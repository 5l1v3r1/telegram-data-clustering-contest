Jamie Lee Curtis has spoken about her problems with drug addiction in a new interview, and spoke about once taking cocaine and freebasing with her Dad, actor Tony Curtis.

“I knew my dad had an issue because I had an issue and he and I shared drugs,” Curtis said, before expanding: “I did cocaine and freebased once with my dad. But that was the only time I did that, and I did that with him.”
She added that “drugs were very much a family problem”.

Continuing to discuss her addiction, Curtis said: “I was the wildly controlled drug addict and alcoholic. I never did it when I worked. I never took drugs before 5 p.m. I never, ever took painkillers at 10 in the morning.
“It was that sort of late afternoon and early evening — I like to refer to it as the warm-bath feeling of an opiate. It’s like the way you naturally feel when your body is cool, and you step into a warm bath, and you sink into it. That’s the feeling for me, what an opiate gave me, and I chased that feeling for a long time.”
Curtis is set to star in Halloween Kills, the latest instalment in the horror series, and shared a glimpse of progress on the film last month as filming began.
“I do not like horror movies,” she admitted to NME in an interview last year.
