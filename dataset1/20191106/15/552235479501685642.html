      <h2>PC Martin Foye luckily escaped serious injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:13:55+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rutherglen Reformer, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rutherglen-reformer/</a></address>
      <p>A children’s football coach who mowed down a police officer in his powerful Range Rover has walked free from court.</p>
      <p>Stephen Gibson, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Rutherglen</a> , sent PC Martin Foye hurtling through the air in October last year.</p>
      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard the 31-year-old had gone to his estranged wife’s home amid claims he was struggling with the break-up.</p>
      <p>PC Foye luckily escaped any serious injury following the hit-and-run in Cambuslang.</p>
      <p>Gibson, who coaches youngsters for Giffnock North, could have faced jail on Friday having admitted to a charge of dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Andrew Cubie instead ordered him to do 250 hours of unpaid work and banned him from the road for two years.</p>
      <p>He told Gibson: “This was a serious offence as the circumstances involve injury to a police officer and damage to cars.</p>
      <p>“Why you went to your wife in the early hours of the morning is beyond me.</p>
      <p>“It was unwelcome and she phoned the police. She did not play a part in this.</p>
      <p>“You panicked and your actions were criminal.”</p>

      <p>Gibson was also hit with a six-month restriction of liberty order.</p>
      <p>A previous hearing was told how PC Foye and a colleague tried to stop Gibson after he smacked his 4x4 into another car.</p>
      <p>But Gibson yelled at the officers: “I am not stopping. I am going for it.”</p>
      <p>His lawyer told the court Gibson had argued with his estranged wife before leaving her home.</p>
      <p>Billy Lavelle, defending, added: “He was struggling with the situation as they were together for 10 years. It was his first relationship.</p>
      <p>“He left in his car but thought he would be arrested when the police arrived.</p>
      <p>“He wishes to apologise to the police officer.”</p>
      <p>Gibson had initially gone to trial last month before prosecutors accepted his guilty plea.</p>
