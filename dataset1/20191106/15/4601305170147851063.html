      <h1>Exclusive samples from Charles Burns' new book, Free Shit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:00:03+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>Charles Burns is one of my all-time favorite cartoonists. I had no idea that since 2000 he has been self-publishing a zine that he sends to a small circle of friends, called <i>Free Shit</i>. I'm deeply hurt not to be included on his mailing list, but I can find a morsel of solace in this anthology of drawings from the pages of <i>Free Shit</i>.  The book is called <a href="https://amzn.to/2rjxYab">Free Shit</a>, and is published by Fantagraphics, who kindly gave me permission to run a selection of the drawings that appear in the book.</p>
