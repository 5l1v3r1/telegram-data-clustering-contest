      <p>An idiot was caught driving a large tractor on a busy Plymouth roundabout while off his face on cocaine.</p>
      <p>Luke Honey, aged 23, put others at risk driving badly while four times the legal limit for the drug on the Leigham interchange over the A38, a court heard.</p>
      <p>He was banned from the road and handed a suspended prison sentence by city magistrates.</p>
      <p>Honey pleaded guilty to driving a John Deere tractor on the <a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/all-about/leigham">Leigham</a> Roundabout with greater than the specified limit of benzoylecgonine in his blood.</p>

      <p>The chemical is produced as cocaine is absorbed in the system.</p>
      <p>He had more than 200 micrograms of the drug in 100 millilitres of blood when he was stopped on May 3. The legal limit is 50.</p>
      <p>Magistrates ruled that a custodial sentence was necessary because of the high level of the drug.</p>
      <p>The bench ruled that he had driven a large tractor over a long distance and there was evidence of bad driving.</p>
      <p>Honey, of Kelly near Lifton on the Devon and Cornwall border, was handed an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months.</p>
      <p>He was disqualified from driving for 30 months and ordered to pay Â£115 victim surcharge.</p>
