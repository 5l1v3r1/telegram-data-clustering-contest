The Cabinet has repeatedly called for an early vote during the recent Brexit crisis, as Parliament was unable to agree on a deal, negotiated by PM Johnson. The opposition Labour Party, however, demanded to ask the bloc for another extension and refused to back a snap vote before it's done.
Following a series of talks, London asked for a new delay, postponing the Brexit deadline until January 2020.
