      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/richard-branson">Sir Richard Branson</a> is opening up his private island to all holidaymakers - but you're going to need quite the holiday budget.</p>
      <p>Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, is usually reserved for Sir Richard, or guests who book it out for exclusive use.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneur has also been known to invite famous friends for a holiday including the likes of Barack and Michelle Obama, Mariah Carey, Harry Styles and David Hasselhoff.</p>
      <p>However for a few weeks a year, dubbed the 'Celebration Weeks' the island opens up in a hotel-style where you can book individual rooms. (You can check out the full list of dates below).</p>
      <p>That's because the accommodation consists of Bali-style villas which boast multiple ensuite bedrooms, with breathtaking views of the beaches.</p>
      <p>You're going to need a big budget though as rooms start from £3,782 a night for couples.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>That includes your accommodation, all your food and drink, access to the two infinity pools and the beach hot tub, the tennis courts, water sports equipment, and wireless internet.</p>
      <p>Although you'll need to sort your own flights, it does include your return launch transfer from Virgin Gorda or Beef Island airports.</p>

      <p>Oh, and on most of the weeks there's a minimum stay of seven nights.</p>
      <p>The island is open exclusively for adults for two weeks, before also opening up to families for the following two weeks, so the Celebration Weeks do tailor to a wide array of holidaymakers.</p>
      <p>In fact, the island's Great House features a bunk room which sleeps up to six children with additional rates from £2,700 per night.</p>

      <p>Alongside the special booking openings, Necker Island will be offering small group bookings for the first time, kicking off from June 2020.</p>
      <p>That means that small groups of 8-15 people will be able to book the island on a shared non-exclusive basis, with rates from £3,872 per room, per night.</p>

      <p>The 74-acre estate suffered significant damage when it was hit by Hurricane Irma, but has since undergone extensive renovations.</p>
      <p>That includes the newly renovated Bali Hi complex which will offer private plunge pools and heaps of luxury.</p>
      <p>Then of course there are those crystalline ocean waters, white sandy beaches and colourful coral reefs which make up the island's picture-perfect landscape.</p>
