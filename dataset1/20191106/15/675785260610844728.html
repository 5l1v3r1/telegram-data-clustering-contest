      <p>"Eli has been told about periods since he saw blood on my pants a couple of years ago (I no longer have them now and tbh it is shit when it’s seen as like the ultimate feminine superpower because I’m still a woman so).</p>
      <p>"I didn’t use the language of women have periods because it’s not entirely inclusive.</p>
      <p>"I told him that some women, some non binary people and some men have periods.</p>
      <p>"Trans men may have ‘female’ sex organs and still experience periods and some non binary people have periods too therefore removing a female logo off the front of sanitary products helps include us all isn’t that wholesome and a nice gesture?</p>
      <p>"It's not insulting to women, it’s not discrediting women, it’s opening up the community to make it a safe space for those who don’t identify as women but still have periods."</p>

      <p>One person wrote: "Wow...wtf! Confuse the kid why don't ya!"</p>
      <p>While a third person commented: "Now this is too far lol the world is broken."</p>
