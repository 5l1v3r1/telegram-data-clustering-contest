Exclusive samples from Charles Burns' new book, Free Shit
06 Nov 2019, 15:00 by Mark Frauenfelder
Charles Burns is one of my all-time favorite cartoonists. I had no idea that since 2000 he has been self-publishing a zine that he sends to a small circle of friends, called Free Shit. I'm deeply hurt not to be included on his mailing list, but I can find a morsel of solace in this anthology of drawings from the pages of Free Shit.  The book is called Free Shit, and is published by Fantagraphics, who kindly gave me permission to run a selection of the drawings that appear in the book.
