Majority of voters expect Trump to be reelected: Poll
06 Nov 2019, 15:39 by Zachary Halaschak
A majority of voters believe President Trump will be in office after the 2020 election.
A Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday found that 56% of all voters expect Trump to remain president. Of those, 85% of Republicans, 56% of independents, and 35% of Democrats feel that he will be reelected.
Those numbers come despite Trump's approval rating consistently being lower than his disapproval rating. A recent poll found that 41% of voters approve of Trump with 54% expressing disapproval.
The new survey found that voter enthusiasm is soaring even almost a year out from the election. More than 80% of voters said they are motivated about 2020, with 69% of respondents saying they are “very motivated.”
In terms of voting prospects, 92% said they are likely to head to the polls in November of next year.
“President Trump’s reelection prospects seem to be energizing voter enthusiasm across the political spectrum,” said Tyler Sinclair, vice president of Morning Consult. “Our data points show that Republicans and Democrats are equally inclined to say they are motivated and likely to vote in next year’s election.”
The survey was conducted from Nov. 1-3 and had a 2% margin of error.
