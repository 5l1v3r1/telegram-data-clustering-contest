近幾年公眾對旅遊保險的關注度逐漸提高，只要有天災人禍的情況發生，旅遊保險便發生功用，例如前年「天鴿」、去年「山竹」、今年社會運動都會令旅程受到影響。到底旅遊保險的保障範圍是否涵蓋所有情況呢? 消費者應如何將部分，甚至全數旅遊風險轉嫁予保險公司？

小心全年旅保拒賠
讀者胡小姐今年27歲，現職甜品師傅的她，月入$22,000。由於她熱愛旅遊，想購買一份全年旅遊保險，故來信詢問投保前及索償時應注意的重大事項，使每個旅程更為安心。市面上可供選購的旅遊保險種類繁多，保費各有不同，一般而言保費愈高的計劃，保障範圍及保額相對愈高，最重要是投保前必須了解清楚保障條款及合約內容，切勿抱著「短途旅行唔會出事」的心態而輕視這一點。
「受保原因」是旅遊保的靈魂，任何沒有符合受保原因的索償都會被拒，常見原因有因意外受傷或疾病所引致的醫療費用、目的地突然發生航運機構員工之罷工、暴亂、民亂、 天然災難、恐怖襲擊、爆發傳染病或在未能預計的情況下旅程目的地被發出黑色警示、機場關閉等。
隨身攜帶保障條文
常見保障範圍有個人財物、旅程受阻、人身意外、緊急醫療等。即使疲於追趕行程，筆者建議應爭取時間（如乘機/乘車/用膳期間）仔細閱讀合約內容，萬一出發前或中途或到步後出現非預期狀況，都能夠清楚自身權益，將損失減至最低。建議胡小姐隨身攜帶保障條文 （手機版或紙張版），詳情可聯絡 閣下的理財顧問了解更多。
顧名思義，「全年旅遊保」的保障期當然是一年，但每次旅程的日數則限制為90至120天，所以胡小姐安排長途旅行時，盡量以此為限，否則要先回香港再出發，保障才會再生效。一般業餘及消閒活動，包括滑雪、水肺潛水、高山遠足、跳傘等都受到保障，相反極限活動大多不在賠償範圍內，如攀岩、衝浪、生存遊戲、越野摩托車等。胡小姐如有以上嗜好請多加留意。
在眾多索償個案中，以個人財物及航班延誤最為常見，受保人需要在意外發生後21至30天內向保險公司提出正式的索償，如超過期限或不作受理。個人財物屬「高風險」項目，如手機、相機、錢包、行李箱等，只要預備損毀後的彩色照片、購買收據、維修或替換的報價單證明、登機證等便是有效的索償證明。
如不幸遇上盜竊或搶劫情況，需於24小時內盡快當地報案索取紀錄，並詳細列明遺失財物的資料及價值，亦可幫助索償。當遇到航班延誤，大多是因為天氣惡劣甚至天災，保險公司會受保未知的天氣警告，所以務必趁早買定！只要延誤超過一定時數便可獲賠償，例如每6小時賠500元，上限2,000元。
請注意，任何已存在的情況保險公司都有權拒保拒賠，例如最近的社會運動。基於法庭已頒布臨時禁制令，任何阻礙機場運作的運動即屬違法，筆者相信此舉可有效令機場運作暢順，從而減低不必要的索償。最後，預祝胡小姐享受每一個美好旅程，即使購買了旅遊保都要注意多加人身安全啊。

[Full-year travel insurance] 27-year-old female dessert teacher loves travel |Liu Qiming
06 Nov 2019, 15:06 by Insurance Strategy
In recent years, the public's attention to travel insurance has gradually increased. As long as there are natural disasters and man-made disasters, travel insurance will take effect. For example, the ""Yose"" in the previous year and the ""Mangosteen"" last year, this year's social movement will affect the journey. In the end, does the coverage of travel insurance cover all situations? How should consumers pass some or even all of the travel risks to insurance companies?

Be careful with the annual travel insurance refusal
Ms. Hu, a 27-year-old reader, is currently a sweetener, with a monthly income of $22,000. Since she loves to travel and wants to purchase a full-year travel insurance, she wrote a letter asking about the major issues that should be paid attention to before the insurance and the claims, so that each trip is more reassuring. There are many types of travel insurance available on the market, and the premiums vary. Generally speaking, the higher the premium, the higher the coverage and the higher the amount of insurance. The most important thing is that you must understand the terms and conditions of the contract before you apply for insurance. Don't underestimate this with the mentality of ""short trips will happen"".
""The reason for being insured"" is the soul of travel insurance. Any claim that does not meet the insured will be rejected. Common causes are medical expenses caused by accidental injury or illness, sudden strikes of shipping agency employees, riots, people. Chaotic, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, outbreaks of infectious diseases or black warnings at the destination of the trip, airport closures, etc., in case of unforeseen circumstances.
Carrying protection provisions with you
Common coverage includes personal belongings, travel delays, personal accidents, and emergency medical care. Even if I am tired of catching up with the itinerary, I suggest that you should strive for time (such as during the flight/ride/meal period) to read the contents of the contract carefully. If there is an unexpected situation before or during the journey or after the trip, you will be able to understand your rights and losses. Minimized to a minimum. It is recommended that Miss Hu carry the protection clause (mobile version or paper version) with me. For more information, please contact your financial advisor for more information.
As the name suggests, the ""year-round travel insurance"" is of course one year, but the number of days per trip is limited to 90 to 120 days. Therefore, when Miss Hu arranges long-distance travel, try to limit it to this. Otherwise, I must first return to Hong Kong. If you start again, the protection will take effect again. General amateur and leisure activities, including skiing, scuba diving, mountain hiking, skydiving, etc. are guaranteed. On the contrary, most extreme activities are not covered by compensation, such as rock climbing, surfing, survival games, motocross and so on. Miss Hu, if you have any of the above hobbies, please pay more attention.
In many claims cases, personal property and flight delays are the most common. The insured person needs to file a formal claim with the insurance company within 21 to 30 days after the accident, such as exceeding the time limit or not accepting the application. Personal property is a ""high-risk"" project, such as mobile phones, cameras, wallets, suitcases, etc., as long as the damaged color photos, purchase receipts, repair or replacement quotation certificates, boarding passes, etc. are valid proof of claims.
If you are unfortunate enough to encounter theft or robbery, you need to report the case as soon as possible within 24 hours, and detail the information and value of the lost property. It can also help claim. When encountering flight delays, mostly due to bad weather or even natural disasters, insurance companies will be covered by unknown weather warnings, so be sure to buy them early! As long as the delay exceeds a certain number of hours, you can get compensation, for example, 500 yuan per 6 hours, the upper limit is 2,000 yuan.
Please note that any existing situation insurance company has the right to refuse to pay, such as the recent social movement. Since the court has issued an interim injunction, any movement that hinders the operation of the airport is illegal. The author believes that this will effectively smooth the operation of the airport and reduce unnecessary claims. Finally, I wish Mrs. Hu to enjoy every good journey. Even if I purchase a travel insurance, I must pay more attention to personal safety.
