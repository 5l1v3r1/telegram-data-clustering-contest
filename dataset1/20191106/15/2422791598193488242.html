      <h1>Putin says new weapons unrivalled anywhere in world, won't be used for threats</h1>

      <p>MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia's new weapons have no foreign equivalents but he insists the country will not use them to threaten anyone.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a meeting with senior military officers, Putin said that "we plan to build up our defence capability, commissioning hypersonic, laser and other new weapons systems that other countries don't have."</p>
      <p>"Yet it's not a reason to threaten anyone," he added.</p>
      <p>The Russian leader claimed that the new weapons systems are designed exclusively to "ensure our security in view of the growing threats," and vowed to pursue arms control efforts.</p>
      <p>Russia's relations with the West have plunged to the lowest levels since the Cold War years over the conflict in Ukraine and other disputes.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Putin announced an array of new weapons, including a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, a hypersonic glide vehicle, a nuclear-armed underwater drone and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.</p>
