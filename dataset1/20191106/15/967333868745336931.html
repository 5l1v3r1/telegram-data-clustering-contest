        <b>As if this wasn’t enough to shock comic book fans, Variety reported that Andy Serkis, who is best known for giving his voice to Gollum in the Lord of the Rings saga, may be cast as Bruce Wayne’s faithful butler.</b>

      <p>Hats off to Warner Brothers! Filming of the new Batman movie has not yet started, but people and fans of the franchise are already talking about it. First WB, which owns DC comics, stunned everyone when it cast lanky Robert Pattinson in the leading role, then they upped the ante by choosing Paul Dano to play the Riddler, one of Batman’s villains. Now they've decided to finish movie lovers and comic books fans as media reports now say Colin Farrell is in talks to play Oswald Cobblepot or The Penguin, while Andy Serkis is rumoured to be playing Bruce Wayne’s trustworthy aide Alfred Pennyworth.</p>
      <p>The news has set social media ablaze with netizens arguing about WB’s choice, which many found incredibly weird. Some users thought it would be better if Farrell had been cast as Batman’s butler, while Andy Serkis, who is famous for his portrayal of eerie creatures, played the Penguin.</p>

      <p>​Other users noted that Farrell is too handsome to play a creepy villain and thought other actors, including Jack Black, Michael Shannon, or Robin Tayor, should be cast in that role.</p>

      <p>​If the rumours are true, both Farrell and Serkis will join Zoey Kravitz, who plays Catwoman and Jeffrey Wright who was cast as police commissioner Gordon. Filming of the new Batman movie will start in 2020 and it is scheduled to hit screens in the summer of 2021. But that's not all! Rumour has it that Warner Brother wants Matthew McConaughey to play Two-Face.</p>
