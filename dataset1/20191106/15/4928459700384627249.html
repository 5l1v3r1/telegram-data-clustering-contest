      <p>WINDSOR – Disappointment, anger and frustration are being expressed after about 160 Canadian flags were taken from the First World War section of a Windsor cemetery.</p>
      <p>The flags were reported missing from Windsor Grove Cemetery on Monday.</p>
      <p>President of the Windsor Veterans Memorial Services Committee Paul Lauzon is upset over the theft from soldiers’ gravesites.</p>
      <p>Lauzon tells CTV News he can’t understand why someone would take the flags, which are not valuable and are available at dollar stores.</p>
      <p>"They're not going to win this, I don't care if I have to come out here and reflag it again, veterans will be remembered," says Lauzon.</p>
      <p>The flags were put up by committee members last week as a tribute leading up to Remembrance Day.</p>
      <p>Within hours of learning of the story, a local man who wants to remain anonymous donated more than 100 flags to replace some of the ones that were stolen.</p>
      <p>"It's a great feeling, it restores hope that people do care," adds Lauzon.</p>
      <p>A bigger Canadian flag on the pole was also stolen.</p>

      <p>"We have an idea who this guy is, he's been in and out of here a few times, we have called the police" adds Ed Shabsove, the General Manager of the Windsor Grove Cemetery. "It's just so disrespectful. Actually it's disgusting. I don't know what I could say to him."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the crime is asked to call Windsor Police or Crime Stoppers.</p>
