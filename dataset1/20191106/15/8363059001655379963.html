      <h1>Rick and Morty Season 4 Makes its UK Debut in January 2020</h1>

      <p>The show will come to Channel 4 two months after its US debut on Adult Swim.</p>
      <p>Season 4 of <i>Rick and Morty</i> is coming to Channel 4 in January 2020, with repeats on E4, and a streaming option on All 4. The US premiere date of November 10 was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/rick-and-morty-season-4-release-date/">announced last month</a>, which consists of the first five episodes of the 10 episode series, so we'll have to wait a couple of months to get involved, which definitely won't lead to people pirating the show.</p>
      <p>"Millions of fans have been waiting for more than two years for a new series of <i>Rick and Morty</i>, the most brilliantly bonkers show on television," said Ian Katz, director of programme. "We’re thrilled that it will be aired exclusively on Channel 4 and I promise it will be worth the wait.”</p>
      <p>We got our first peek at the new series <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/rick-and-morty-season-4-trailer/">this summer</a> and the official Twitter account has been <a href="https://twitter.com/RickandMorty/status/1190346543188066306">sharing tidbits</a> of what's in store ever since.</p>
      <p>The air date for the second half of series 4 has yet to be confirmed on either side of the pond.</p>
