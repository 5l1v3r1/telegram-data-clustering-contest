《善愛為寶  台灣共好》
阿彌陀佛！
聽到最高法院今天審理結果，我長嘆一聲、也無可奈何，突然想起白天看到的靜思語：「付出能忘懷煩惱、安然自在」，心情平靜了一點。
過去6年來，社會對我及油案有很多誤解，一開始我們錯失了說明機會、到後來已經失去話語權，百口莫辯、眾人指責。長達20多年的佛教信仰成為我最大的支撐，我選擇相信司法，選擇「說我所說、做我所做」，希望一步一腳印、往我心中的善愛之路前行，期待有一天能化開誤解，集結更多的人一起共植福田、一起讓台灣共好。
這段時間，我全心投入味全龍的復出以及各項公益志業的推動，看著公益夥伴們慢慢上軌道，像是將才學堂技職計畫，幫助了300多位弱勢學童培養出能幫他們改變出身、翻轉未來的烘焙技能，這就讓我感到很安慰，也覺得我們又往「善愛為寶、台灣共好」的理想又接近了一點。
味全龍的復出，也是這段時間讓我很欣慰的事情，我還記得今年6月24日中華職棒會員大會確認通過味全龍加盟案，會後開記者會宣告味全龍「回家」的那天，網路上許多球迷歡聲雷動，我的心情跟球迷一樣激動。
之後球隊整軍完成，我看著小龍們在棒球場上奔馳、一天比一天成熟的表現，內心非常欣慰，時值世界12強棒球賽，我心想小龍們明年就要打二軍、後年要打一軍，應該很快也能成為未來中華隊的驕傲，不管我在哪裡，我一定會繼續盡我所能支持球隊。
面對司法審判結果，我非聖人、當然有所不平，心想這應該是上天給我的功課，今天看到的靜思語也提到：「求佛保佑、不如行善助人」，我決定繼續說我所說、做我所做，我相信人有二十難、有心就不難，「善愛為寶、台灣共好」的理想不變，有願就有力。


魏應充貼文一出，湧入大量網友留言加油，味全龍打擊教練張泰山也來留言打氣。（翻攝自來自永靖的老園丁-魏應充臉書）

The declaration of the new oil product case Wei Yingchong: Choosing to believe in justice, expecting to have a day to dispel misunderstanding
06 Nov 2019, 15:01 by Ye Wenquan, Wang Junfeng
This (6th) Supreme Court heard the case of Dingxin Oil Products and sentenced Wei Yingchong to conviction. The Supreme Court held that 26 of them were clear and dismissed, and 7 of them were for a total of 5 years and 9 months. Wei Yingchong will In jail, the other 19 guilty part of the conviction can be fined by the company; another 45 crimes are not judged by the first instance, and sent back for further trial. In response, Wei Yingchong responded on Facebook: ""Society has a lot of misunderstandings about me and the oil case. At the beginning we missed the opportunity to explain, and then we have lost the right to speak. It is a hundred words."" But he still decided to ""choose to believe in justice and choose"" Say what I said and do what I did, I look forward to one day being able to dispel misunderstandings and gather more people to plant Futian together and let Taiwan work together.""


After receiving the verdict, Wei Yingchong expressed his feelings on Facebook. (Reflected from the old gardener from Yongjing - Wei Yingchong's face book)

The above is the full text of Wei Yingchong's face book:
""Love is a treasure, Taiwan is good""
Amitabha!
I heard the results of the Supreme Court’s hearing today. I sighed and couldn’t help but suddenly remembered the meditation that I saw during the day: “I can forget my troubles and be comfortable,” and I feel calm.
In the past six years, the society has had a lot of misunderstandings about me and the oil case. At the beginning, we missed the opportunity to explain, and then we have lost the right to speak, and we are arguing and blaming everyone. The Buddhist faith of more than 20 years has become my greatest support. I choose to believe in justice and choose to say ""say what I say, do what I do"". I hope that one step at a time, the road to good love in my heart, I look forward to one day. Can dispel misunderstandings, gather more people to plant Futian together, and let Taiwan share together.
During this time, I devoted myself to the return of Wei Quanlong and the promotion of various public welfare undertakings. I watched the public welfare partners slowly get on track, like the school’s technical plan, which helped more than 300 disadvantaged students to cultivate. I am very comforted to help them change their origins and turn over the baking skills of the future. I also feel that we are closer to the ideal of ""good fortune and good fortune"".
Wei Quanlong’s comeback is also a time for me to be very pleased. I still remember that on June 24 this year, the China Professionals General Assembly confirmed the adoption of Wei Quanlong’s case. After the meeting, I opened a press conference to announce that Wei Quanlong’s “go home”. On that day, many fans on the Internet were thunderous and my mood was as excited as the fans.
After the team finished the whole army, I watched the dragons running on the baseball field and matured day by day. The heart was very happy. When the world top 12 baseball game, I thought the dragons will play the second army next year. If you want to fight an army in the year, you should soon become the pride of the Chinese team in the future. No matter where I am, I will continue to do my best to support the team.
In the face of the judicial trial results, I am not a saint, of course, there is an injustice. I thought that this should be the homework that God gave me. The Jingsi language I saw today also mentioned: ""Buying Buddha is better than helping others."" I decided to continue. Say what I said and do what I did. I believe that people have 20 difficulties and have a heart. It is not difficult. The ideal of ""good love is treasure and Taiwan is good"" is unchanged.


Wei Yingchong posted a text, poured a large number of netizens to comment on the fuel, and the taste of Quanlong strike coach Zhang Taishan also came to comment. (Reflected from the old gardener from Yongjing - Wei Yingchong's face book)
