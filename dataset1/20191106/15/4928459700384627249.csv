WINDSOR – Disappointment, anger and frustration are being expressed after about 160 Canadian flags were taken from the First World War section of a Windsor cemetery.
The flags were reported missing from Windsor Grove Cemetery on Monday.
President of the Windsor Veterans Memorial Services Committee Paul Lauzon is upset over the theft from soldiers’ gravesites.
Lauzon tells CTV News he can’t understand why someone would take the flags, which are not valuable and are available at dollar stores.
""They're not going to win this, I don't care if I have to come out here and reflag it again, veterans will be remembered,"" says Lauzon.
The flags were put up by committee members last week as a tribute leading up to Remembrance Day.
Within hours of learning of the story, a local man who wants to remain anonymous donated more than 100 flags to replace some of the ones that were stolen.
""It's a great feeling, it restores hope that people do care,"" adds Lauzon.
A bigger Canadian flag on the pole was also stolen.



""We have an idea who this guy is, he's been in and out of here a few times, we have called the police"" adds Ed Shabsove, the General Manager of the Windsor Grove Cemetery. ""It's just so disrespectful. Actually it's disgusting. I don't know what I could say to him.""
Anyone with information about the crime is asked to call Windsor Police or Crime Stoppers.
