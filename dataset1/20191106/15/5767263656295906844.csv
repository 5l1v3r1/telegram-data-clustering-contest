18 Pictures That Prove Time Goes by Too Quickly

06 Nov 2019, 15:30

The world population has grown by 1.5 billion people within the last 20 years according to statistics. While it sometimes takes things or people a couple of years to see the difference time brings, others need longer. And time doesn’t stand still — it keeps moving — changing everything in its path.
We at Bright Side got pretty nostalgic while looking at the photos from this compilation and would like to remind you to use your time wisely. Our bonus at the end of the article will prove once again that there is nothing more powerful than time.
