      <p>Toronto publication <a href="https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/on/toronto/drake-more-life-flowers-are-mysteriously-appearing-around-toronto"><i>Narcity</i></a> reported that mysterious bouquets of flowers were appearing around Drake’s home city yesterday (November 5).</p>
      <p>Some were handed out on the street by people wearing jackets emblazoned with ‘More Life’ – the title of Drake’s 2017 project – while others were sent to the offices of radio and television broadcasters.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/drake-more-life-growth-co-announcement/">Now, according to <i>HighSnobiety</i>,</a> the ‘More Life Growth Company’ is listed on the Canadian trademark database where the company is listed to sell “Cannabis products and accessories, medical cannabis, THC and CBD.” Cannabis was legalised in Canada in 2018.</p>
