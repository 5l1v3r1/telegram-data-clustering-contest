      <p>After getting his sea legs as Prince Eric during T<i>he Little Mermaid Live!</i> it seems like this <i>Riverdale</i> star is ready to make the leap to the big screen. During an interview with <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> ahead of ABC's live musical, <a href="https://www.etonline.com/graham-phillips-talks-possibly-playing-prince-eric-in-live-action-little-mermaid-exclusive-135683">Graham Phillips said he wants to play Prince Eric in the live-action </a><i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/graham-phillips-talks-possibly-playing-prince-eric-in-live-action-little-mermaid-exclusive-135683">The Little Mermaid</a> </i>movie. The actor — whose first breakthrough role was in the Broadway musical <i>13</i> alongside Ariana Grande — <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/prince-eric-in-the-little-mermaid-live-is-played-by-a-riverdale-star-19298159">played Prince Eric for the live musical event</a> on Nov. 5, and was hoping that his performance would win over the film's producers as well as Ariel.</p>
      <p>"I'm sort of seeing this as my audition for the movie role," Phillips said with a laugh. "So, we'll see how this goes." According to <i>ET</i>, the actor also pretended to zip his lips when asked if he has been in talks for the role. Despite throwing his hat into the ring to play the highly-coveted role, Phillips noted that he wasn't "too nervous," thanks to his theater background. "I started out my career doing opera, Broadway and stuff, so it feels kinda like a homecoming," he said.</p>
      <p>His one big concern: "The thing I'm most nervous about is his hair," Phillips admitted. "I mean, it's tough 'cause he's royalty, so he's got to have the coif. But he's also a sailor, he's the nautical prince, so it's a really tough balance to make." Based on <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-the-little-mermaid-live-be-on-hulu-the-special-might-be-hard-to-rewatch-19297993">the reaction to his performance</a> on social media, it seems that both Phillips and his hair managed to make viewers everywhere swoon for his Prince Eric.</p>

      <p>Before Phillips won over fans on <i>The Little Mermaid Live!</i>, several big names in Hollywood were reportedly in talks to bring Ariel's love interest to life. In July, <i>Variety</i> and the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> named <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/harry-styles-may-play-prince-eric-in-the-little-mermaid-according-to-new-reports-18206352">Harry Styles as the frontrunner</a> for the role, though about a month later, the former outlet reported that <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/harry-styles-isnt-prince-eric-in-the-little-mermaid-live-action-according-to-new-reports-18654188">the former One Direction star had passed</a>. "I want to put music out and focus on that for a while," Styles told <i>The Face</i> in September about his decision to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-styles-explains-turning-down-little-mermaid-prince-eric-role-1237336">turn down the role of Prince Eric</a>.</p>
      <p>That same month, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/09/the-little-mermaid-prince-eric-cameron-cuffe-jonah-hauer-king-testing-role-1202743642/">Deadline reported that <i>Krypton </i>star</a> Cameron Cuffe and Jonah Hauer-King were in talks for the role; <i>13 Reasons Why</i> star <a href="https://www.etonline.com/13-reasons-why-star-christian-navarro-reveals-hes-auditioning-for-prince-eric-in-little-mermaid">Christian Navarro revealed on Twitter</a> that he had also auditioned to play Prince Eric.</p>
      <p>Whoever ends up playing Prince Eric will join a star-studded cast of the live-action <i>Little Mermaid</i>, including <i>Grown-ish</i> star and <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/halle-bailey-is-ariel-in-disneys-little-mermaid-live-action-movie-youll-definitely-recognize-her-18171334">Grammy nominee Halle Bailey as Ariel</a>. And she will reportedly be joined by <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-little-mermaid-live-action-movie-cast-includes-several-a-list-celebs-19295854">Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch</a>, Awkwafina as Scuttle, Jacob Tremblay as Flounder, and <i>Hamilton</i> and <i>Blindspotting </i>star Daveed Diggs as Sebastian the crab — though these castings have yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>The live-action <i>Little Mermaid</i>, which <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-does-the-live-action-little-mermaid-come-out-halle-baileys-take-on-ariel-is-years-away-18179168">is set to begin production in 2020</a>, will also feature new music from Lin-Manuel Miranda and Alan Menken. Hopefully, Disney fans won't have to wait until then to find out who will bring one of the franchise's most beloved princes to life.</p>
