      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 6 — Wall Street stocks dipped early today, pausing after recent records, as investors awaited concrete progress on US-China trade talks.</p>
      <p>Hopes that the United States and China will formalise a trade agreement have helped lift stocks to records but buying fatigue is beginning to set in, analysts said.</p>
      <p>“The baseline view remains that a partial deal of some kind will be reached soon but with the absence of pen to paper to sign a deal, past history suggests market participants can’t take that fully for granted,” analyst Patrick O’Hare wrote at Briefing.com.</p>
      <p>“Hence, some of the upward momentum linked to trade deal optimism has ebbed.”</p>
      <p>About 20 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 27,476.44, down 0.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>The broad-based S&amp;P 500 also shed 0.1 per cent, falling to 3,073.12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.3 per cent to 8,410.11.</p>
      <p>The Dow has closed at records the last two days. Besides better sentiment on trade, the market has also been boosted by better-than-expected earnings and a series of Federal Reserve interest rates cuts.</p>
      <p>HP Inc surged 10.6 per cent following reports that Xerox is considering acquiring the technology company. Xerox gained 2.3 per cent. — AFP</p>
