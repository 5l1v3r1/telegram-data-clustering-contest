      <h1>This Is Why Bitcoin Price Could Hit $55,000 Next Year: Crypto Zombie in Trader’s Digest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T15:15:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">George Georgiev</a></address>
      <p>If you’ve ever watched Bitcoin-related videos on YouTube, you’ve probably gotten to know K-Dub. K-Dub is a 32-year-old from New York who broadcasts live each day on his popular channel Crypto Zombie.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiUnrCUGCJTCC7KjuW493Ww">Crypto Zombie</a> is one of the most popular channels around, with an astonishing number of over 90,000 subscribers as of writing this. Every night you can meet him on YouTube, and when I write ‘meet him,’ this really describes his attitude toward his thousands of loyal followers.</p>
      <p>K-Dub’s daily streams combine aspects of technical and fundamental analysis. He analyzes the Bitcoin charts while speaking about the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-news/">day-to-day crypto news</a>.</p>
      <p>In the following interview with CryptoPotato, K-Dub shares his long-term Bitcoin predictions, his secret sauce for becoming a leading crypto YouTuber in just two years, and his trading tips for beginners.</p>
      <h3>The College Experiment</h3>
      <p>
        <b>When did you first hear about cryptocurrencies? What amazed you about Bitcoin and the crypto world? </b>
      </p>
      <p>Initially, I was introduced to Bitcoin back in college by a friend who was mining it on his computer. I didn’t take it very seriously at the time; not many people did. Fast forward to early 2017: one of my peers actually used Bitcoin to send a payment to a friend in another country.</p>
      <blockquote>I was shocked that this experiment I’d heard about back in college was still legit and actually being used. I decided to buy some and forget about it. A few weeks later, the price had boomed! That’s when I began to dive even deeper.</blockquote>
      <p>Once I started learning all the fundamentals behind Bitcoin and what made this technology so amazing, the price seemed less relevant, and I became hooked. I haven’t looked back since.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What’s the most crucial lesson that beginner traders should learn from the 2017 crypto bubble?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not sure if there is one single most important lesson, but the biggest problem I saw was people simply buying into anything that was being hyped.</p>
      <p>Never invest in something that you don’t actually understand. Never buy into an altcoin simply because your favorite crypto YouTuber (this includes me) or analyst won’t stop talking about it.</p>
      <p>You never know what that individual’s motive is. They could merely be looking to unload their heavy bags.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s the first tip you would give someone about <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/8-must-read-tips-trading-bitcoin-altcoins/">trading Bitcoin and crypto</a>?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest tip right from the start is to learn risk management. If you’re trading with more money than you can afford to lose, then you’re doing it wrong.</p>
      <blockquote>You should not be having sleepless nights because you’re not sure if you will be able to afford the rent because you decided to go all-in on a basket of “low cap gems” that “eventually have to pump…. right?” Also, learn to spot trends.</blockquote>
      <p>There is a reason they say the trend is your friend. Why catch a falling knife trying to time the bottom? In reality, most people can’t. Wait for a confirmed uptrend. Sure, you might miss out on the first 25% or so gain, but now you ride the next 200% worry-free! I’m oversimplifying it, but I think you get my point.</p>
      <p>Also, if you are new to trading, there are many programs that allow you to “fake trade” so that you can essentially practice trading without actually risking any of your money.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins? Don’t Want to Hold Them For Years</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Please share your short-term Bitcoin price analysis as well as a longer-term one.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The biggest short term hurdle was to fill the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-bitcoin-and-crypto-futures-guide-for-beginners/">CME futures</a> gap. Although some might call it a self-fulfilling prophecy, so far, every single gap we have ever had has been filled.</p>
      <p>It’s also good to note we have another gap up around the $11.8k level. I do anticipate us to close that one at some point, as well. Short-term, as long as BTC is able to remain above the 200-days MA I will remain bullish. The next level of significant resistance is between the $9.4k to $9.5k level.</p>
      <p>A solid daily close above $9,557, and I think we will see the bulls really rushing back in hard! On the other hand, I’m looking for the $8.5 to $8.7k region to hold for support; if it doesn’t, then we will have to change our tune.</p>
      <p>However, regardless of whatever choppy price action Bitcoin sees short term, I do believe we will close out Q4 positive. I don’t think we will see a new all-time high this year, but then again, anything can happen! For example, back in January, most people thought $10K was impossible!</p>
      <p>
        <b>In your opinion, will we ever see new all-time highs for altcoins? If you had to pick 5 altcoins to hold for the next 10 years, which would you choose? </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I do believe we will see new all-time highs for some altcoins, but not all.</blockquote>
      <p>In 2017 you could basically throw a dart blind-folded at any altcoin and make massive gains during the hysteria. Unfortunately, as many found out, most projects over-promised and under-delivered.</p>
      <p>You will need more than a fancy whitepaper to gain investors’ trust this time around, and I don’t believe we will have another “alt season” as we did in 2017 ever again. Yes, there will be a select few that will prosper, but only because they genuinely deserve that valuation. As far as altcoins go, I can’t think of any I would be willing to hold for years.</p>

      <p>
        <b>You have an enormous number of subscribers. How did you do it? What’s your secret sauce for keeping up a successful stream like yours, day after day?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is actually a question I get asked a lot. The main reason is I enjoy what I do, so that’s why I rarely take days off. It’s been almost two straight years of back-to-back videos, except for a handful of absences.</p>
      <p>I’m incredibly passionate about the space, and I think that shows. Another reason, I believe, is because I’ve been able to build such an amazing community. Without them, my channel would be nothing.</p>
      <p>I’d be a guy talking to myself all day! While many other crypto “influencers” and analysts essentially packed up and left during the bear market, I continued to put out content regardless of sentiment or price. I feel that it is a two-way street between content creators and their audience, and I always want to make sure they realize how much I appreciate them!</p>
      <h3>$55,000 For One Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>
        <b>In your opinion, what’s the highest price Bitcoin will reach during 2020, the year of the halving?</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I believe Bitcoin could hit around $55K – roughly a $1 trillion market cap by today’s supply. It’s not as crazy as people think.</blockquote>
      <p>We saw an $880 billion total crypto market cap at the peak of the 2017 mania, so I don’t see why Bitcoin alone couldn’t reach those levels again, especially after the halving. Remember, people said BTC would never even make it to a $100 billion market cap. We are up 250% from that prediction even now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And what about 2030?</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, the reason why this is difficult to predict is that there are so many factors that could affect this number by that year.</p>
      <p>With the fear of another economic recession looming around the corner accompanied by the fact that governments are racing to devalue their fiat currencies – sometimes not even intentionally – hyperinflation, quantitative easing, negative-yielding bonds, et cetera, the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket as high as even a million dollars per Bitcoin! The price could boom not only because of people buying Bitcoin but because fiat will simply fail horribly, in my opinion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Finally, please share something interesting in your personal life. </b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m actually a huge music, movies, and pop culture fanatic! I’ve been playing drums ever since I can remember. I toured the country with my previous rock band and produced several hip hop and dance albums as well. I also have a nice-sized vinyl collection.</p>
      <p>I’m a huge film nerd, and I love to collect movie memorabilia and props too. And in case you haven’t noticed, I love talking about Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies.</p>
