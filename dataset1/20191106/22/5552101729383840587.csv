拍電影竟會手軟發抖流冷汗　特戰部隊出身讓他由黑翻紅

獲頒今年金馬獎「年度台灣傑出電影工作者」的湯湘竹，是資深錄音師、也是紀錄片導演。以錄音助理踏入電影圈的湯湘竹，1990年起跟著前輩錄音師杜篤之工作，雖然滿腔熱情，但起步階段也受到一些挫折。尤其新手默契與經驗不足，現場遇到狀況師父難免口氣不好糾正錯誤。湯湘竹笑說，當年師父杜篤之可能覺得怎麼收了這樣的徒弟，不過到了1992年拍侯孝賢導演的《戲夢人生》時，湯湘竹卻成了師父的得力助手。



湯湘竹透露，自己剛入行時，杜篤之跟錄音老搭檔楊靜安、楊師傅很有默契，新加入的他相較之下，動作或配合度都沒那麼熟練，所以只能一點一點慢慢累積。拍侯導《戲夢人生》時，為到中國大陸福建長期拍攝，杜篤之因為對湯湘竹的能力沒把握，因此又找一個比較熟練的組員。


金馬獎「年度台灣傑出電影工作者」湯湘竹除了是資深錄音師，執導的紀錄片也曾獲金鐘、金馬獎肯定。

「那時器材沒那麼好，侯導每個鏡頭膠卷都是1000呎跑完、大概10幾分鐘，那時廣角鏡頭多、麥克風又重，舉boom（收音麥克風的吊桿）非常辛苦。那位組員不到10天，手都抬不起來。沒辦法，我就上場了。我舉boom能力不錯，以前是特種部隊，吃過很多苦，那不算什麼。」通過這關，湯湘竹的工作態度與能力漸受肯定，但他說，「我常在一個鏡頭拍完後，在旁邊流冷汗，全身發抖。」
「那段時間台灣電影都流行長鏡頭，所以那時候被磨練得滿厲害。」幸好湯湘竹喜歡慢跑，藉此可以鍛鍊體力。他說，「在大陸拍《戲夢人生》時，附近有個學校，我常會在那跑步。那時剪接師廖慶松、廖桑負責側拍紀錄片，他看到我跑，也下來跑，結果他跑一跑後來比我還瘋狂，還體悟出『跑步是動態的打坐』，分享慢跑心得。」
如今湯湘竹回頭看跟著杜篤之工作多年，覺得學習到很多，「尤其是追求好品質的堅持，這部分很棒。」

The film was actually soft and shivering. The special forces were born to make him turn red.

Tang Xiangzhu, who was awarded the Golden Horse Award of the Year ""Outstanding Taiwan Filmmaker of the Year"", is a senior sound engineer and documentary film director. Tang Xiangzhu, who entered the film circle with the recording assistant, has been working with the predecessor recording engineer Du Fu in 1990. Although he was full of enthusiasm, he also suffered some setbacks in the initial stage. Especially the novice tacit understanding and lack of experience, the situation encountered on the scene Master is inevitable to correct the error. Tang Xiangzhu said that when Master Du Fu may feel that he had received such an apprentice, when he was filmed by Hou Hsiao-hsien in 1992, Tang Xiangzhu became Master's right-hand man.



Tang Xiangzhu revealed that when he first entered the business, Du Fuzhi had a good understanding with the old recording partners Yang Jingan and Master Yang. Compared with him, the movement or cooperation was not so skilled, so he could only slowly accumulation. When I was filming ""Dream Life"", for the long-term shooting in Fujian, China, Du Fu was not sure about the ability of Tang Xiangzhu, so he found a more skilled team member.


In addition to being a senior sound engineer, the Golden Horse Award ""Taiwan Outstanding Film Worker"" Tang Xiangzhu has also won the Golden Bell and Golden Horse Awards.

""At that time, the equipment was not so good. Houyi filmed each lens film was 1000 ran, about 10 minutes. At that time, the wide-angle lens and the microphone were heavy, and the boom (the boom of the radio microphone) was very hard. The team member In less than 10 days, my hands could not be lifted. No way, I will be on the court. I have a good boom ability. I used to be a special force. I have suffered a lot. It is nothing."" Through this, Tang Xiangzhu’s work attitude and The ability is gradually affirmed, but he said, ""I often swayed cold sweat and shivered after a shot.""
""Taiwan movies were popular for long shots during that time, so they were honed at that time."" Fortunately, Tang Xiangzhu likes to jog, so that he can exercise. He said, ""When I was filming ""Dream Life"" on the mainland, there was a school nearby. I used to run there. At that time, the editors Liao Qingsong and Liao Sang were responsible for the side-by-side documentary. He saw me running and running down. After he ran a run, he was still more crazy than me. He also realized that ""running is a dynamic meditation"" and shared the experience of jogging.""
Now Tang Xiangzhu looks back at Du Fu’s work for many years and feels that he has learned a lot. “Especially, the pursuit of good quality is very good.”
