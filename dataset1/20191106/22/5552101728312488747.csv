暴風圈外看名導　侯孝賢天人合一、王家衛團隊像在跳舞

台灣資深錄音師湯湘竹不只在兩岸三地和馬來西亞等地工作，也曾與侯孝賢、楊德昌、蔡明亮、王家衛、陳可辛、許鞍華等華語片名導合作。由於每位導演的電影形式，往往反映在他們的工作方式上，因此工作前湯湘竹也會先了解導演的特點，有所準備。他笑稱，「錄音組很重要，但又不那麼關鍵，有時像在暴風圈外緣，看著整個劇組。」



湯湘竹舉例：「像侯導，就是天人合一。現場不能有干擾、打破演員情緒的東西出現，連攝影機都不可以，環境塑造幾乎寫實。有一次拍片，侯導總覺得不太對，就進來看看我、看看杜哥，然後說『出去』！杜哥立即把錄音車推出去，但我得吊Boom怎麼出去？靈機一動，就在牆角找塊布把自己圍起來。」

另外湯湘竹也曾參與王家衛電影《花樣年華》與《2046》的前段和後段，「王家衛電影的劇本基本上到現場才會拿到，今天要拍的對白才剛影印出來，熱熱的。不過他的團隊非常強，演員也很厲害，所以他拍了5、6個take之後，有時想換個方式，整個團隊就跟著他一起再來一次。那種感覺像在跳舞，滿特別的。」
雖與兩岸三地、馬來西亞等不同劇組合作過，但湯湘竹說，他的工作方式其實都是一樣的，「而且不管是短片或國際知名導演的電影，我的態度也都一樣。」他曾有將近10年、每年接1、2部香港電影，剛開始在香港工作，覺得當地人動作非常快，「你如果動作比較慢，或別人覺得你拖時間，他們就馬上把錢結清要你走。因為你多浪費一點時間，就是多費用，也沒人會為聲音或什麼問題等你。」

做了一陣子，香港人才發現湯湘竹的不同，「最明顯是在剪接的時候，他們發現想要的聲音有錄到。在拍片時，我想要錄什麼聲音的時候，他們有時覺得我多事，但這是我的工作態度。」
除了錄音工作，湯湘竹也是紀錄片導演，曾以《山有多高》獲金馬獎最佳紀錄片。紀錄片一方面滿足他當導演的憧憬與喜愛旅行的天性，同時深入探索有興趣的領域，尤其是台灣原住民與身分認同議題。每次拍紀錄片，他都會進行長時間的田調，但因工作養家，只能見縫插針，利用空檔，通常每部影片都得耗時3年。

Look at the name of the storm circle Hou Hsiao-hsien, heaven and man, Wang Jiawei team is dancing

Tang Xiangzhu, a senior Taiwanese recording engineer, has worked not only in the three places, but also in places like Malaysia. He has also cooperated with Chinese films such as Hou Hsiao-hsien, Yang Dechang, Cai Mingliang, Wang Jiawei, Chen Kexin and Xu Anhua. Because each director's film form is often reflected in the way they work, Tang Xiangzhu will also understand the characteristics of the director and be prepared before the work. He laughed and said, ""The recording group is very important, but it is not so critical. Sometimes it looks like the outer edge of the storm circle, watching the whole crew.""



For example, Tang Xiangzhu: ""Like Hou Dao, is the unity of heaven and man. There can be no interference on the scene, things that break the actor's emotions, even the camera can't, the environment is almost realistic. Once in a film, Hou Dao always feels wrong. Come in and see me, look at Du Ge, and then say ""go out""! Du Ge immediately put the recording car out, but I have to hang Boom how to get out? When the machine moves, I will find a piece of cloth in the corner to surround myself.""


In 2002, Tang Xiangzhu (third from right) and director Hou Hsiao-hsien (second from left) and photographer Li Pingbin (third from left) filmed ""Times of Time"" in Tokyo. (Tang Xiangzhu offers)

In addition, Tang Xiangzhu also participated in the front and back sections of Wang Jiawei's films ""In the Mood for Love"" and ""2046"". ""The script of Wang Jiawei's film is basically available at the scene. The dialogue to be filmed today is just a photocopy, hot. But his The team is very strong and the actors are very good, so after he took 5 or 6 take, sometimes he wants to change the way, the whole team will follow him again. It feels like dancing, full of special.""
Although he has worked with different teams from across the Taiwan Straits and Malaysia, Tang Xiangzhu said that his work style is actually the same. ""And regardless of the film or the film of an internationally renowned director, my attitude is the same."" He once had In the past 10 years, I have received 1 or 2 Hong Kong movies every year. I just started working in Hong Kong. I feel that the locals are moving very fast. ""If you move slowly, or if others think you are dragging their time, they will immediately settle the money and ask you to go. Because you waste a little more time, it costs more, and no one will wait for you for your voice or what.""


When filming the documentary ""How High is the Mountain"", Tang Xiangzhu (third from left) and his father (second from left) went to his father's home in Hunan, and the left one was photographer Guan Benliang. (Tang Xiangzhu offers)

After a while, the talents of Hong Kong discovered the difference between Tang Xiangzhu. ""The most obvious thing is that when editing, they found that the sound they wanted was recorded. When I was filming, when I wanted to record something, they sometimes felt that I was more This is my attitude.""
In addition to recording work, Tang Xiangzhu is also a documentary film director. He won the Golden Horse Award for best documentary film ""How High is Mountain"". On the one hand, the documentary satisfies his instinct as a director and loves to travel, while exploring the areas of interest, especially Taiwan's aborigines and identity issues. Every time he takes a documentary, he will make a long-term field adjustment, but because of his work, he can only see the needles and use the gaps. Usually, each film takes 3 years.
