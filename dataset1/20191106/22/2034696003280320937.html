      <p>The Chris Martin-fronted band <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-tease-new-double-album-mysterious-letter-fans-2559182">announced details of their “experimental” two-part record</a> last month, previewing the project with the tracks ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coldplay-orphans-arabesque-track-reviews-2560714">Orphans’ and ‘Arabesque</a>’.</p>

      <p>With the LP due to arrive on November 22, the band have now offered another glimpse of their ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-coldplay-16355">A Head Full Of Dreams</a>‘ follow-up via Instagram.</p>
      <p>“Here’s a preview of ‘Guns’ – the opening track on the ‘Sunset’ half of ‘Everyday Life’,” Coldplay captioned the post. On the cut, frontman Martin’s lyrics tackle the ongoing debate surrounding the US’ approach to gun control.</p>
      <p>“<i>All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs/ Advertise a revolution/ Arm it when it comes</i>,” he sings over a folk-inspired acoustic guitar part. Martin later adds: “<i>The judgment of this court is/ We need more guns</i>.”</p>
