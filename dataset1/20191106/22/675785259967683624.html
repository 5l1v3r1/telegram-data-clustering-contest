      <h1>Son Heung-min opens up on Andre Gomes injury aftermath after Tottenham double</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham star Son Heung-min scored twice against Red Star Belgrade after his sending off at Everton on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:28:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:28</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham star Son Heung-min has opened up on his "really tough few days" after the challenge which caused Andre Gomes to suffer a horrific ankle injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder Gomes has undergone successful surgery on a fracture dislocation on his right ankle and been released from hospital after suffering the injury at Goodison Park on Sunday.</p>
      <p>South Korean star Son left the field in tears and inconsolable after being sent off for the sliding tackle which caused the Portuguese international to fall awkwardly.</p>
      <p>Son, who has had his red card overturned by an independent panel after an appeal, scored twice as Spurs beat Red Star Belgrade 4-0 in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>He appeared to apologise as he celebrated his opening goal before saying he is "really, really sorry" for the "accident" that took place.</p>
