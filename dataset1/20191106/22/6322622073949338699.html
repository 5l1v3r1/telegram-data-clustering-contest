      <p>BELGRADE (Nov 7): Tottenham Hotspur closed in on a berth in the Champions League knockout stages after two goals from Son Heung-min and one each by Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen gave them a resounding 4-0 Group B win at Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The result left Spurs second in the group on seven points from four games, five behind leaders Bayern Munich who sealed a last-16 berth with two games to spare after a 2-0 home win over Olympiakos Piraeus.</p>
      <p>Third-placed Red Star have three points and Olympiakos one.</p>
      <p>Lo Celso, who is on loan at Spurs from Spanish side Real Betis, fired the visitors ahead with a freakish 34th-minute goal and the clinical Son netted twice in quick succession after the break to silence a fervent home crowd.</p>
      <p>Late substitute Eriksen added the gloss when he tucked the ball past goalkeeper Milan Borjan at the near post after another fine assist by the lively Danny Rose.</p>
      <p>Red Star twice hit the woodwork on stroke of halftime and Spurs keeper Paulo Gazzaniga kept out a Milan Pavkov sitter with a superb reflex save midway through the first half but Spurs dominated throughout on a warm evening. - Reuters</p>
