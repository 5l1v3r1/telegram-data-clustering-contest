      <h1>Golden toilet worth more than a $1 million may break world record</h1>

      <p>If Goldfinger had a toilet, it would probably resemble this nearly $1.3 million <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle">gem-encrusted</a>, golden john that surfaced at a Shanghai trade fair last week.</p>
      <p>The lavish loo is gunning for a Guinness World Record for most diamonds in a toilet seat (yes, that’s a category) with over 40,000 adorning its bulletproof rim — as if all the gold wasn’t ostentatious enough.</p>

      <p>The $1,287,652 (£999,497) piece is produced by Coronet, one of Aaron Shum Jewelry’s brands. Shum himself debuted the high-karat crapper Monday at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>Shum didn’t disclose whether or not he had any prospective buyers, although he <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7651573/1million-Gold-toilet-bullet-proof-seat-40-000-diamonds.html">told the Daily Mail</a> that the bejeweled baño might be better off at a “diamond art museum so that more people can enjoy it.”</p>

      <p>It would fit right in within any esteemed collection. The gilded throne’s rim features more than 40,815 diamonds, clocking in at an eye-popping 334.68 carats in total.</p>
      <p>And if that wasn’t James Bond villain enough, the seat’s also bulletproof.</p>

      <p>Coronet said the gaudy potty is slated for inspection by Guinness this week to determine if it qualifies for a world record. This would mark the 10th record for the jeweler, which previously won titles for most diamonds set in a watch, and most diamonds set in a handbag with <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/commercial/2018/4/hong-kong-jeweller-mounts-nearly-10-000-diamonds-on-coca-cola-inspired-handbag-523515">a swanky Coca-Cola-inspired purse</a>.</p>
      <p>Coronet has also produced a diamond-studded guitar and a pair of pink shoes worth $2 million and $4.28 million, respectively. Although it’s safe to say none are as garish as this gilded toilet.</p>

      <p>And in the realm of bathroom bling, Coronet’s crapper <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/09/16/i-rode-the-guggenheims-golden-throne/">is not nearly as tasteful</a> as Maurizio Cattelan’s 18-karat solid gold throne.</p>
