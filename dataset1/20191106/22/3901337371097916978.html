      <p>Chiefs moved seven points clear of second-place Mamelodi Sundowns with a 2-0 victory over Chippa in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Middendorp made eight changes from the Telkom Knockout win over Orlando Pirates and Zuma certainly put up his hand to be in contention for Saturday's clash.</p>
      <p>"If a player scores two goals coming out of the game, I think it's not a secret, we coaches around the world we think about "hmm, he's in such a good mood", can be an option for the Saturday game, there's no doubt about it," Middendorp told SuperSport after the game.</p>
      <p>"But we started this evening to control ourselves, not being too emotional and prepare ourselves with the right attitude and temperament. These kind of games that come three days later, then you need some replacements, be careful with injuries.</p>
      <p>"The first half three players [from Chippa got injured], that's not the result of today, it's a result of the 120 minutes they played on Sunday, and that's it. I wish them good, hopefully they get the points they need."</p>
