      <p>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) reported a 41 percent spike in unaudited consolidated net income to ₱4.5 billion for the first nine months of 2019 from the ₱3.2 billion reported for the same period last year.</p>

      <p>In a disclosure, the bank said the robust growth was driven by its focus in strengthening core business, consistently generating double-digit growth in net interest income.</p>
      <p>Interest income from loans and receivables expanded by 24 percent to ₱24.1 billion on account of higher average loan volume of key select markets.<br/>Loans to consumers, which include mortgage loans, automobile loans, and credit cards, increased by 18 percent to ₱126.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Gross outstanding credit card receivables accelerated by 43 percent to ₱27.9 billion as of September 2019 with an active card base of 836,000, higher by 26 percent than last year.</p>
      <p>Moreover, loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) continued to grow year on year by 20 percent to ₱64.8 billion.</p>
      <p>“We see more potential in the fast-growing consumer and SME sectors. We expect them to be 50% of our customer base by next year,” RCBC President and CEO Eugene Acevedo said.</p>
      <p>Trading opportunities boosted the Bank’s profitability as it generated ₱7.1 billion in Trading and foreign exchange gains in the nine months ended September 2019.</p>
      <p>Likewise, fee-based income increased by 12 percent to ₱3.1 billion, driven by higher revenues from deposit and branch fees, card-related fees, and trust fees.</p>
      <p>“Our double-digit income growth is a reflection of the bank’s prudence in tapping the right prospects in the market, while expanding capacity and enhancing customer experience in the core business,” Acevedo added.</p>
