【衛生紙革命（中）】全球一天「擦掉」2.7萬顆樹　改用再生紙漿新創品牌爆紅大賣
06 Nov 2019, 22:31 by 查修傑
就像空氣，衛生紙也是生活中不起眼，但少了它卻立刻不便、甚至造成恐慌的必需品。從去年台灣島上的「衛生紙之亂」，僅僅因為網路和媒體上些許漲價風聲，就掀起連續好幾個月瘋狂搶購和囤貨風潮，即可見一班。
無論台灣還是美國，目前消費市場上最主流、銷量最大的衛生紙品牌，都是以處女紙漿（或稱原生木漿）為原料，加工製作而成的產品。以美國而言，寶鹼（Procter & Gamble）、金百利（Kimberly Clark）等衛生紙大廠的產品原料幾乎都來自加拿大的北方森林，這些樹木年代久遠，一旦砍伐需要很久的時間才能恢復原本的覆蓋率，對林地生態造成難以彌補的衝擊。
不僅如此，砍下來的木材在轉化成紙漿的過程中，必須加入大量化學藥品進行漂白和提高韌性、柔軟度等繁複製程，從維護地球環境的角度來看，是很不環保的一項消費性日用品。
但衛生紙之所以會成為環保團體和新創業者不約而同盯上的目標，最大的原因，還是它的使用頻率和使用量。
根據世界自然基金會統計，全世界每天消耗的紙張相當於27萬顆樹的砍伐量，而其中就有一成──也就是2萬7千顆樹──是用來製造隨手擦拭，用完即丟的衛生紙。隨著環保觀念提升，上個世紀的90年代，美國市場上開始出現以「再生紙」為原料的衛生紙產品，但由於行銷和包裝手法都偏向保守，市占率始終無法擴大。
這種情況直到2012年，一家以群眾募資方式創辦的社企「Who Gives a Crap」跨入衛生紙市場，才出現顛覆性的變化。
一組來自澳洲的創業團隊，有感於全球仍有眾多人口缺乏基本的衛生設備，決定透過生產和販售環保衛生紙的方式，來達到改變衛生紙消費習慣，同時將盈餘捐助落後地區增設廁所的雙重目標。而無論是一語雙關的品牌名稱，還是充滿創意的網路行銷手法，Who Gives a Crap都迎合了千禧世代玩世不恭的惡搞趣味，再加上完全不使用塑膠包裝，配合定期送貨到府的「訂閱制」模式，使得Who Gives a Crap的產品一炮而紅，成功打響「環保公益」衛生紙的名號，培養了一批認同其理念的年輕消費群。
但就在Who Gives a Crap開啟品牌之路同時，環保衛生紙也在一夕間開啟了各路新創人馬對這個無趣日用品的無限遐想，分頭搶進，讓這塊市場出現了罕見的百家爭鳴盛況。

[Toilet Paper Revolution (middle)] Globally ""wiping off"" 27,000 trees a day. Switching to a new brand of recycled pulp.

Just like the air, toilet paper is also inconspicuous in life, but it lacks the necessities of immediate inconvenience and even panic. From the ""spam mess"" on Taiwan Island last year, just because of the slight increase in price on the Internet and the media, we have set off a series of crazy buying and smashing for several months.
Regardless of Taiwan or the United States, the most mainstream and most popular tissue paper brands in the consumer market are processed from virgin pulp (or native wood pulp). In the United States, raw materials such as Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark are almost all from Canada's boreal forests. These trees are old and take a long time to recover. Coverage has an irreparable impact on forestland ecology.
Moreover, in the process of converting the cut wood into pulp, it is necessary to add a large amount of chemicals for bleaching and to improve the toughness and softness of the reproduction process. From the perspective of maintaining the global environment, it is a very environmentally-friendly consumer. Daily necessities.
However, the biggest reason why toilet paper has become the target of environmental groups and new entrepreneurs is its frequency and usage.
According to the WWF statistics, the amount of paper consumed every day in the world is equivalent to the amount of 270,000 trees cut, and one of them - that is, 27,000 trees - is used to make wipes. Lost toilet paper. With the improvement of environmental protection concepts, in the 1990s, toilet paper products based on “recycled paper” began to appear in the US market. However, due to the conservative marketing and packaging methods, the market share has not been able to expand.
This situation did not occur until 2012 when a social enterprise “Who Gives a Crap”, which was founded by a public fundraising method, entered the tissue market.
A group of entrepreneurs from Australia, who feel that there are still many people in the world lacking basic sanitation equipment, decided to change the consumption habits of toilet paper through the production and sale of environmentally friendly toilet paper, and at the same time add surplus toilets to areas with surplus surplus donations. aims. Whether it's a pun brand name or a creative online marketing technique, Who Gives a Crap caters to the cynical spoofs of the millennial generation, plus no plastic packaging at all, with regular delivery to the government. The ""subscription system"" model made the products of Who Gives a Crap a hit, successfully launched the name of ""environmental public welfare"" toilet paper, and cultivated a group of young consumers who agreed with their ideas.
But at the same time that Who Gives a Crap opened the brand road, the environmentally-friendly toilet paper also opened up all the new ideas of this boring daily necessities, and split the head, letting this market have a rare contending scene. .
