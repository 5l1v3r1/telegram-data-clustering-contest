Turns Out Pretty Much Any Movie Scene Can Be Improved With The Addition Of “OK Boomer”
06 Nov 2019, 22:55 by Joseph Earp
We are probably approaching saturation point with the “Ok boomer” meme.
After all, the insult has morphed from a cutting putdown exchanged online into an immensely popular global trend. The thing has been picked apart by explainers, understood as the first volley in an increasingly virulent intergenerational war, demonised by boomers themselves, and used for clickbait by some of the biggest YouTubers on the planet.
But hey, if there’s anything that boomers have taught us, it’s that there’s always value in exploiting precious and natural resources until they become grey husks — so let’s keep riding this train till it blows the hell up.



That’s the attitude of the internet anyway, and particularly those folks over on the corner of Twitter inhabited by cinephiles. They’ve recently learnt that pretty much any movie scene is improved by the introduction of the “Ok boomer” catchphrase, and have shoehorned it into everything from Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man film to superhero teen comedy Sky High.















Of course, the new dimensions of the meme that have now been revealed have pretty much guaranteed that extremely soon we are going to get more “Ok boomer” content than we would perhaps like.
But hey, the planet’s dying, politics has been shifted to the right, and it’s boomers to blame. Might as well have some goddamn fun in the meantime!
