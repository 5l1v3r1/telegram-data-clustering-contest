      <p>Curly or straight, keeping your hair protected from unnecessary damage is probably your biggest hair-related concern — and fine hair is particularly susceptible to damage. While heat styling tools and shampoos containing sulfates are well-known troublemakers, sub-par hair brushes are another culprit behind breakage. The <a href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-hair-brush-for-every-hair-type">best brushes for fine hair</a> are gentle on the hair, won't tug on strands or tangles, and help evenly distribute your scalp's natural oils along the hair's shaft.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-7-best-boar-bristle-brushes-for-healthier-hair-57459">Boar bristle brushes</a> are generally considered a must-have for fine hair. Their bristles are stiff enough to detangle, but still gentle enough that they won't tear or pull out sensitive strands. Boar bristle brushes also do a phenomenal job of distributing the scalp's natural oils from root to tip and softly removing dirt and debris from hair. Damaged thin hair can benefit from an extra-soft boar bristle brush that helps stimulate the scalp, which boosts circulation to hair follicles.</p>
      <p>But 100% boar bristle brushes aren't the only ones you should have on your radar. Brushes with a combination of boar and nylon bristles are great for blow drying, and flexible plastic bristles are perfect for detangling wet hair without breakage. Whichever materials you decide to go with, remember that <a href="http://www.instyle.com/news/how-to-brush-your-hair-right-way">brushing gently is absolutely essential</a>.</p>
      <p>Now that you have a better idea of what you should look for, read on for my list of the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-round-brushes-for-fine-thin-hair-17865482">best brushes for thin hair</a> (and get ready to say goodbye to breakage for good!).</p>

      </p>
      <p>Knots and snarls can cause breakage regardless of hair type, but they really wreak havoc when you have fine hair, which is why it's important to invest in a good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GDK6F2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle6581-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B003GDK6F2">detangling brush</a> like this award-winning one from Tangle Teezer. Featuring memory flex bristles that are firm but still gentle on sensitive hair follicles, this brush can be used on wet or dry hair and glides through it with ease. It's constructed with a mix of long and short teeth, the former to detangle your hair and the latter to smooth it. According to the brand, the brush is so gentle that it can even be used on hair extensions, weaves, and wigs.</p>
      <p><b>What fans say: </b>"My child has so many tangles in her long, finehair and no matter how hard I try, she always ends up crying and asking me to stop. I took a chance on this brush, based on a recommendation from a friend. Best investment ever! Thank you! Not only does it just glide through the hair, but now my child tells me that brushing her hair actually tickles. I'd much rather have her laughing than crying!"</p>

I have always had problems getting them to brush their hair due to the brushes 'yanking on my head' or 'tearing out too much hair'. [...] Well, we just received the Denman brush and the girls are [converts]. They used to hide their hair under hoodies to try to get out of brushing their hair, now they are actually willing to brush their hair, it doesn't hurt and they love the way it looks."</p>
