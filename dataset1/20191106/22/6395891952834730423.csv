TIVERTON, R.I. (AP) - Police say a driver who hit two bicyclists had a blood alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit.
The Providence Journal reports Tiverton Police say toxicology results show 29-year-old Stephen Medeiros, of Little Compton, Rhode Island had a blood alcohol level of .217 and had marijuana in his system when he seriously injured a 30-year-old Little Compton man and a 35-year-old Tiverton woman.
The accident happened Sept. 29 in Tiverton. Medeiros' attorney couldn't immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.
Medeiros is charged with two counts of driving under the influence, resulting in serious bodily injury, and not stopping after the accident. Police say Medeiros did return to the scene to tell officers what happened.
As of last week, the injured man was still in a rehabilitation center. The woman was treated and released.
