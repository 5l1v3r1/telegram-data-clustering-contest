Golden toilet worth more than a $1 million may break world record
06 Nov 2019, 22:01 by Ben Cost
If Goldfinger had a toilet, it would probably resemble this nearly $1.3 million gem-encrusted, golden john that surfaced at a Shanghai trade fair last week.
The lavish loo is gunning for a Guinness World Record for most diamonds in a toilet seat (yes, that’s a category) with over 40,000 adorning its bulletproof rim — as if all the gold wasn’t ostentatious enough.



The $1,287,652 (£999,497) piece is produced by Coronet, one of Aaron Shum Jewelry’s brands. Shum himself debuted the high-karat crapper Monday at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
Shum didn’t disclose whether or not he had any prospective buyers, although he told the Daily Mail that the bejeweled baño might be better off at a “diamond art museum so that more people can enjoy it.”


'BONELESS' DOUGHNUT PACKAGE HAS TWITTER ASKING WHAT A 'BONE-IN' DOUGHNUT IS


It would fit right in within any esteemed collection. The gilded throne’s rim features more than 40,815 diamonds, clocking in at an eye-popping 334.68 carats in total.
And if that wasn’t James Bond villain enough, the seat’s also bulletproof.

Coronet said the gaudy potty is slated for inspection by Guinness this week to determine if it qualifies for a world record. This would mark the 10th record for the jeweler, which previously won titles for most diamonds set in a watch, and most diamonds set in a handbag with a swanky Coca-Cola-inspired purse.
Coronet has also produced a diamond-studded guitar and a pair of pink shoes worth $2 million and $4.28 million, respectively. Although it’s safe to say none are as garish as this gilded toilet.

And in the realm of bathroom bling, Coronet’s crapper is not nearly as tasteful as Maurizio Cattelan’s 18-karat solid gold throne.
