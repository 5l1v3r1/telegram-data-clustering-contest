中共低調恢復進口加國豬牛肉 加大使:中國儲肉耗盡

06 Nov 2019, 22:13

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】孟晚舟事件後，中共一度通過限制貿易報復加拿大，其中包括停止進口加國肉類。但日前中共官方向記者證實，已經從加國恢復進口。加國前駐華大使表示，中國豬肉儲備已耗盡，暗示中共不得不對加拿大低頭。
11月6日，加拿大總理杜魯多（Justin Trudeau）在推特透露，中共將恢復進口加拿大豬肉和牛肉。當天，中共外交部發言人耿爽在例行記者會上也對記者表示，「中方在評估加方提出的整改行動計劃後，同意恢復接受加國簽發的肉類衞生證書」。早前中共禁止加拿大肉類進口的藉口就是「衞生不合格」，中共官方表態顯示已準備恢復進口加國肉類。
加國去年12月逮捕華為財務長孟晚舟後，中共先後停止進口加國油菜籽和肉類，試圖迫使加拿大釋放孟晚舟。這次中共恢復進口加拿大肉類，有外媒據此認為兩國緊張關係趨緩。不過，從中方表態似乎看不出有此跡象。耿爽在宣布接受加拿大肉類衞生證書時，仍堅稱中加關係緊張「責任不在中方」，並要求加拿大立即釋放孟晚舟，「以實際行動推動中加關係早日重回正軌」。
中共使用「人質外交」等手段報復孟晚舟事件，引發加國朝野反感。加拿大不列顛哥倫比亞大學本週一公布的民意調查顯示，對中國持正面態度的加拿大人已不足三成。剛剛結束的加拿大大選中，總理候選人們競相比賽誰對中共更為強硬。
加國前駐華大使聖雅克（Guy Saint-Jacques）表示，中共恢復進口加國肉類，只是因為中國豬肉供應緊張。他透露，加國豬肉業界人士告訴他，上週就有中國進口商詢問他們能供應多少豬肉。
聖雅克表示，中共已經耗盡了自己的豬肉儲備，雖然已最大限度地從巴西和歐洲進口，但非洲豬瘟疫情的嚴重程度超出中共預期，已令中國損失了1億頭豬，豬肉供應至少需要10年才能恢復正常。
近幾個月來，中國各地豬肉價格不斷飆漲，帶動其它肉類、蛋類和食品一起漲價，民眾怨聲載道，已經危及了中共的「政治穩定」。從去年開始，地方政府就已經將「豬肉維穩」作為自己的政績。但因為豬肉短缺嚴重，當局不得不從世界各地加緊進口各種肉類，即使如此，中共的「豬肉維穩」仍然效果不彰。
早在今年9月份，中共就已恢復從美國採購豬肉。在此之前，《華爾街日報》報導，中共的大規模採購，已經造成世界各地的肉類價格飆升，市場供應短缺。
去年，中共不顧民生，堅持對美國豬肉加徵關稅，試圖以此逼迫美國停止貿易戰。但是，美國是中國最大的豬肉供應國，中共禁買美國豬肉，轉而從「盟國」俄羅斯加大進口，結果從俄國「引進」了非洲豬瘟，造成中國的豬肉危機。

The Chinese Communist Party lowered the import of Canadian pig beef in a low-key manner.

06 Nov 2019, 22:13

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] After the Meng Zhouzhou incident, the CCP once retaliated against Canada by restricting trade, including the cessation of importing Canadian meat. However, the Chinese Communist Party officially confirmed to reporters that it has resumed imports from Canada. The former ambassador to China said that China’s pork reserves have been exhausted, suggesting that the CCP has to bow to Canada.
On November 6, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau revealed on Twitter that the Chinese Communist Party will resume importing Canadian pork and beef. On the same day, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sui Shuang, told reporters at a regular press conference. ""After assessing the rectification action plan proposed by the Canadian side, the Chinese side agreed to resume accepting the meat hygiene certificate issued by Canada."" Earlier, the CCP’s excuse for banned Canadian meat imports was “sanitary failure.” The official position of the CCP showed that it was ready to resume importing Canadian meat.
After Canada arrested Huawei’s finance minister, Meng Xingzhou, in December last year, the CCP stopped importing Canadian rapeseed and meat, trying to force Canada to release Meng’s night boat. This time, the CCP resumed importing Canadian meat, and foreign media believed that the tension between the two countries has slowed down. However, it seems that there is no such indication from the Chinese side. When he announced the acceptance of the Canadian Meat Hygiene Certificate, he insisted that China-Canada relations were tense and ""responsibility was not in China"" and asked Canada to immediately release Meng Xiazhou. ""According to practical actions, China-Canada relations will soon return to normal.""
The CCP used ""hostage diplomacy"" and other means to avenge the incident of Meng Xiazhou, which triggered resentment in Canada. According to a poll released by the University of British Columbia in Canada on Monday, there are fewer than 30% of Canadians who are positive about China. In the just-concluded Canadian election, the prime minister candidates are competing against the CCP to be tougher against the CCP.
Guy Saint-Jacques, the former ambassador to Canada, said that the Chinese Communist Party resumed importing Canadian meat only because of the tight supply of Chinese pork. He revealed that people in the Canadian pork industry told him that Chinese importers asked about how much pork they could supply last week.
St. Jacques said that the CCP has exhausted its own pork reserves. Although it has been imported from Brazil and Europe to the maximum extent, the severity of the African swine fever epidemic exceeds the expectations of the Chinese Communist Party. It has caused China to lose 100 million pigs and supply at least pork. It takes 10 years to get back to normal.
In recent months, the price of pork in China has soared, driving other meat, eggs and food to rise in price. People’s complaints have already jeopardized the ""political stability"" of the CCP. Since last year, local governments have made ""pork maintenance"" their own achievements. However, because of the serious shortage of pork, the authorities have to step up the import of various meats from all over the world. Even so, the CCP's ""pork stability"" is still not effective.
As early as September this year, the CCP has resumed purchasing pork from the United States. Prior to this, the Wall Street Journal reported that the CCP’s large-scale procurement has caused meat prices around the world to soar and market supply to be in short supply.
Last year, the CCP ignored the people's livelihood and insisted on tariffs on US pork, trying to force the United States to stop the trade war. However, the United States is China's largest supplier of pork. The Chinese Communist Party banned the purchase of US pork and instead increased its imports from the ""aliens"" of Russia. As a result, the Russian pigs were ""introduced"" from Russia, causing China's pork crisis.
