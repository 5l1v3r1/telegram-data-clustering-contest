【明星推手賺基金6】不識高爾宣生危機感　王牌經紀人勤理財鋪退休路
06 Nov 2019, 22:05 by 劉以親, 王均峰
倪良瑋曾經是唱片公司的小宣傳，如今變成明星經紀人，他語重心長地說：「藝人跟運動員一樣，是有生命週期的，像運動員可能30歲就要走下波或必須轉換跑道，藝人也是如此，因此一定要在能賺錢時守住財富，不管是買房或投資，都要盡早做足準備。」



旗下有近60位藝人的明星經紀人倪良瑋表示，自己的收入和藝人一樣不固定，因此他從很早就開始積極理財，他的第1檔基金是摩根印度基金，紀律投資10多年下來，至少停利4次，光是獲利金額就超過100萬元；最近他剛把獲利2成的東歐基金，停利加碼投資印度基金，力行基金養基金操作術。
「只要是我認同且看好後市的基金，月扣至少1萬5,000元，因為只扣3,000元的話，雖然賠得不多，但1年下來賺得也少，所以在有閒錢、能承擔風險的情況下，我會把扣款金額提高。」由於本金從3,000元放大逾4倍變成1萬5,000元，獲利的絕對金額會隨之放大4倍之多，這麼一來，集中火力在好標的上，錢滾錢的威力將很可觀。
之所以如此有危機意識，倪良瑋娓娓道出是因為看透演藝工作收入不固定的特性，「我大學念書時就進唱片公司當宣傳帶藝人，當時唱片業一片榮景，在那個銷量可以破百萬張的年代，我看過很多藝人錢賺得快，但卻沒有存錢。」
一直在演藝圈的他最近有很深的體悟，「我是1976年出生的，現在關注的演藝圈，跟現在17、18歲年輕人喜好的演藝圈是完全不一樣的耶，他們流行的人事物都跟我熟悉的不一樣，甚至他們講的人是我很陌生的！」
倪良瑋突然問起：「你們知道高爾宣這個歌手嗎？」一旁的攝影記者秒答知道，他立刻回應：「那你一定很年輕！我是最近才從年輕人口中知道他，而且他們居然說出道20年的蔡依林跟張惠妹是『上個』世代的人，天啊！這讓我覺得要多關心年輕人的市場，開發新藝人，更重要的是要繼續理財，把錢守住！」

[Star Pusher Earnings Fund 6] Don't Know Gore Xuansheng Crisis Ace Brokers Diligently Retirement Road
06 Nov 2019, 22:05 by Liu Yiqin, Wang Junfeng
Ni Liangxuan used to be a small propaganda of the record company. Now he has become a star agent. He said with great enthusiasm: ""Artists, like athletes, have a life cycle. Like athletes, they may go down the wave at 30 years old or have to change the runway. Artists are also like this. Therefore, we must keep our wealth when we can make money. Whether it is buying a house or investing, we must prepare as soon as possible.""



Ni Liangwei, a star agent with nearly 60 artists, said that his income is not fixed as an artist. Therefore, he has been actively managing money since very early. His first fund is Morgan India Fund. Disciplinary investment for more than 10 years, at least Suspension 4 times, the amount of profit is more than 1 million yuan; recently he just made a profit of 20% of the Eastern European fund, stop the investment in India funds, and fund the fund management operation.
""As long as it is the fund that I agree with and optimistic about the market, the monthly deduction is at least $15,000. Because I only deduct 3,000 yuan, although I don’t pay much, I earn less in one year, so I have spare money and can take risks. In the case of the case, I will increase the amount of the deduction."" Since the principal has been enlarged by more than 4 times from 3,000 yuan to $15,000, the absolute amount of profit will be enlarged by a factor of four, so that the concentration of firepower is On the right target, the power of money to roll money will be considerable.
The reason why she is so crisis-conscious is that Ni Liangzhuo said that because of the unrestricted income of performing arts work, ""I went to the record company as a propaganda artist when I was studying at the university. At that time, the recording industry was in a good position. In the age of 10,000, I have seen many artists earning money quickly, but they have not saved money.""
He has been in the entertainment industry recently and he has a deep understanding. ""I was born in 1976. Now I am concerned about the entertainment industry. It is totally different from the current entertainment circles of 17- and 18-year-olds. They are popular people. Things are different from what I am familiar with, even the people they speak are strange to me!""
Ni Liangzhu suddenly asked: ""Do you know Gao Erxuan as a singer?"" The photo reporter on the side answered that he immediately responded: ""Then you must be very young! I only recently knew him from the mouth of the young people, and they actually said Jolin Tsai and Zhang Huimei, who have been debuting for 20 years, are the ""last"" generations, my God! This makes me feel that I should care more about the young people's market, develop new artists, and more importantly, continue to manage money and keep the money!""
