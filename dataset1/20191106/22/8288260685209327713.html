      <p>Dean Smith just can’t get away from the chant about John McGinn – even at home!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa’s</a> all-action midfielder continues to be toast of the terraces at Villa Park and has his own song.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn,”</a> sing the Villa fans. “Super John McGinn, I just don’t think you understand, he’s Dean Smith’s man, better than Zidane - we’ve got super John McGinn!”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a> will be used to hearing those lyrics on a matchday by now, but it also follows him home.</p>

      <p>The Villa boss told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11677/11855830/john-mcginns-aston-villa-hero-status-explained-by-dean-smith?fbclid=IwAR3pdNJrRlj_x7SoWAM0yZeyksNi8oaO2MUzLB5-xQXxhzUiwFro0-WEDeM">Sky Sports:</a> "I was sat in the garden the other week having a cup of coffee and I could even hear my neighbour's kid singing the McGinn song in the bathroom.”</p>
      <p>McGinn, a bargain buy from Scottish Premiership side Hibernian last summer, has taken to step up to the Premier League in his stride.</p>
      <p>He’s already bagged three league goals this season, set up two more and generally proved a thorn in the side of every opposition player who has been near him.</p>
      <p>“I'm asking him to get in the opposition box and score, but also create," added Smith. "That was the thing I felt we could help him with, because of his intelligence tactically."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has also scored four times for Scotland this term, including a first ever senior hat-trick when playing against San Marino last month.</p>
      <p>"It's probably been a little bit about sometimes reining him in," said Smith.</p>
      <p>"But we certainly don't want to stop him doing what he's really good at, which is arriving in the opposition box."</p>
