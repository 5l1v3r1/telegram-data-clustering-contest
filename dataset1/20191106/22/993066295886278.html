      <p>Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell has revealed she has named her baby girl Atlas Noa.</p>
      <p>The actress, who welcomed her daughter last month, spilled the beans about her name in a moving Instagram post about being a mum.</p>
      <p>She said: “Atlas Noa, In my 32 years of life I thought I had seen a lot of places, experienced a lot of things, met a lot of people and felt love…then came you.</p>
      <p>“Truth is I had no idea I was capable of loving anything like this before you arrived.</p>

      <p>“You wonder if that’s just something people say, but it’s as if the chemical makeup of my entire body and soul changed the minute we met.”</p>
      <p>Mitchell said she wakes up each day “still in awe that you are mine, and I am yours”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m still learning about you and I’ll never grow old of watching you slowly wake up, catch a glimpse of me or your dad and focus intently, almost as if to say ‘I know you.’</p>
      <p>“Just know, sweet girl – Whatever you choose to do in this world, whoever you choose to love, wherever you choose to go, I will always be your biggest fan. I am already so proud to be your Mama.</p>
      <p>“PS. The days of dressing you up as burritos and other snacks has only just begun.”</p>
