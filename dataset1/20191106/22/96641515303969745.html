      <h1>Alphabet's board is investigating how sexual misconduct claims were handled</h1>
      <h2>The parent company of Google expects to have results next month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T22:59:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 22:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Today <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/alphabet-board-investigating-inappropriate-relationships-by-execs.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;par=sharebar"><i>CNBC</i></a> reports that Alphabet, the parent company of Google that was formed in 2015, is investigating how execs investigated sexual misconduct. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-reckoning-with-history-of-interoffice-romance-by-top-execs">Years</a> of eyebrow-raising stories about behavior by top officials at Google preceded a report last year by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"><i>New York Times</i></a> that highlighted a $90 million payment to Android co-founder Andy Rubin after a misconduct probe, another payment to former search head Amit Singhal and also allegations against then-X research division director Rich DeVaul, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/30/alphabet-x-richard-devaul-resign/">resigned shortly after</a>.</p>
      <p>In a letter to employees responding to the article, CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/25/google-has-fired-nearly-50-employees-for-sexual-misconduct-since/">said the company had fired 48 employees over the last two years</a>, including 13 at the senior management level or higher, for sexual harrassment.</p>
      <p>The way those investigations and others were handled have been cited among reasons for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/31/google-walkout-for-real-change/">employee walkout a year ago,</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/11/lawsuit-details-google-exec-payouts/">investor lawsuits</a> claiming the Alphabet board of directors -- including Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt -- was directly involved in covering incidents up. In a California state court filing, the company revealed the board formed an independent subcommittee and hired a law firm to investigate the issues, and sought to move a response deadline to December so that it would have the results of that investigation.</p>
      <p>Alphabet's chief legal officer David Drummond is specifically named in the report, under review over accusations of relationships with employees. In 2007 he had a child with Jennifer Blakely, a woman who worked in Google's legal department, and in August she <a href="https://medium.com/@jennifer.blakely/my-time-at-google-and-after-b0af688ec3ab">wrote on Medium</a> that he abused his power over her while also engaging in affairs with others at the company. SEC filings <a href="https://twitter.com/daiwaka/status/1191530775184699393">showed</a> Drummond received a $27 million profit from exercising stock options earlier this week.</p>
      <p>In a statement to <i>CNBC</i>, an Alphabet spokesperson said "As has already been confirmed in public court filings, in early 2019, Alphabet's Board of Directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct." <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-probe/alphabet-board-probes-companys-handling-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations-idUSKBN1XH003"><i>Reuters</i></a> reports that the response deadline has been moved to December 13th, when Alphabet expects to have finished its investigation.</p>
