      <h1>Colin Farrell in Talks to Play Batman’s Sexy Penguin Nemesis</h1>

      <p>Does Robert Pattinson’s Batman have a new nemesis? Perhaps. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/colin-farrell-the-penguin-batman-movie-cast-1202766532/">Deadline</a>, Colin Farrell is in talks for the role of the Penguin for Matt Reeves’s <i>The Batman</i>, which has <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/robert-pattinson-is-the-night-robert-pattinson-is-batman.html">Robert Pattinson</a> in the titular role and recently cast<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/zoe-kravitz-to-star-as-catwoman-in-upcoming-batman.html"> Zoë Kravitz</a> as Catwoman and Paul Dano as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-batman-cast-paul-dano-the-riddler.html">the Riddler</a>. (Give us the bodysuits!!) You will remember also that this is the Batman<i> </i>film Jonah Hill <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jonah-hill-passes-on-the-batman-film-movie-zoe-kravitz.html">is not in</a>, in case you’ve lost track of your DC movies and your batmen. The last time we saw Penguin on the big screen he was being played by Danny DeVito, who brings a considerably different vibe than Farrell, but this is not the actor’s first time in the superhero sphere. He previously played the card-slinging Bullseye in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/08/ben-affleck-batman-superhero-daredevil.html">Ben Affleck’s <i>Daredevil </i></a>—<i> </i>an era we will not let them forget!</p>
