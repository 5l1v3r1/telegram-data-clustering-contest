錄音師隨機應變　演員頭髮與丁字褲裡有玄機
06 Nov 2019, 22:26 by 項貽斐 , 張匡皓, 余孟儒
電影錄音工作分為現場錄音與後期音效，從事錄音工作近30年的湯湘竹早年除了參與現場錄音，也會到錄音室幫忙後期，不過後來他還是選擇到拍片現場工作。



他說，「我跟杜哥（杜篤之）做了幾年後期，但後來想想，如果我進錄音室認真工作，應該就出不去這個錄音室。兩者各有趣味，前期是買菜、後期是炒菜，但我更喜歡和大家出去淋雨、曬太陽、交朋友。」

每次接到工作，湯湘竹會先看劇本、了解合作班底，有時也會配合勘景，提早知道現場環境。他指出同步錄音技術門檻沒那麼高，但必須靠經驗的累積，才能排除臨場遇到的各種狀況，甚至一到現場就先發現問題。
同步錄音最珍貴的就是捕捉到現場演員稍縱即逝的聲音表情，以及獨特的環境音。因此錄音師得協助解決或補救各種現場聲音問題，例如：拍攝地旁邊就是抽水馬達；或有廟會、西索米出現。這些情況有的要靠老天幫忙，有的有時間性，最好預先避免或耐心等待。如果對白不長、情緒不太重，也可以等安靜時再單收一次，在後期合成。

湯湘竹強調，錄音人員很需要各部門的幫助。像拍攝時請場務組攔車、維持秩序；Boom在燈光下有影子，要請燈光師、攝影師注意；還有要看服裝表，知道演員造型，選擇安裝麥克風的位置。以魏德聖執導的《賽德克．巴萊》為例：不少演員服裝是披一塊布、動作很大，所以收音麥克風就藏在頭上辮子裡，發射器則藏在臀部T字褲腰繩上，怎麼動都不會穿幫。

The sound engineer is responsive. There is a mystery in the actor's hair and thong.

The film recording work is divided into live recording and post-sound effects. Tang Xiangzhu, who has been engaged in recording for nearly 30 years, will participate in the recording room to help the later stage, but he will choose to work on the film.



He said, ""I did a few years with Du Ge (Cuckoo), but then I thought, if I work in the studio, I should not go out to this studio. Both are interesting, the first is to buy food. In the later period, it is cooking, but I prefer to go out with the rain, sun, and make friends.""


Tang Xiangzhu (former) likes to work with the film crew, this is the film ""Sidek. Bale"" scene. (fruit film offers)

Every time I receive a job, Tang Xiangzhu will first read the script, understand the cooperation team, and sometimes cooperate with the survey to know the scene environment. He pointed out that the threshold of synchronous recording technology is not so high, but it must rely on the accumulation of experience to eliminate the various situations encountered on the spot, and even find the problem first when it arrives at the scene.
The most precious thing about simultaneous recording is to capture the fleeting sound expressions of the live actors and the unique ambient sounds. Therefore, the sound engineer can assist in solving or remedying various live sound problems, such as: a pumping motor next to the shooting location; or a temple fair, Sisomi. Some of these situations depend on God's help, and some have time, it is best to avoid or wait patiently. If the dialogue is not long and the emotions are not too heavy, you can wait for the time to be quiet and collect it once again.


""Sedek. Bale is deeply rooted in the deep forests of Taiwan. (fruit film offers)

Tang Xiangzhu stressed that the recording staff needs the help of various departments. When shooting, please ask the team to stop the car and maintain order; Boom has a shadow under the light, please pay attention to the lighting engineer and photographer; and look at the clothing table, know the actor's shape, and choose the location where the microphone is installed. Said by Wei Desheng. Bale, for example: Many actors' costumes are covered with a piece of cloth and have a lot of movements. Therefore, the radio microphone is hidden in the head and the transmitter is hidden on the hips of the T-shaped waistband of the hips.
