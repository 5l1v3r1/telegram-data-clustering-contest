Amazon has shared a long list of devices that will be discounted ahead of Black Friday. These deals will begin on Friday, November 22nd, with several waves of Amazon’s own products going on sale during the week that leads up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Like the other major retailers, Amazon usually goes big for the shopping season, so you can probably expect even more deals once Black Friday arrives. But for now, this is the info we have to go on. If you’ve been looking for a deal on a tablet, Kindle e-reader, smart security camera, Echo speaker, or smart display, these might appeal to you.

Here’s the list straight from Amazon:
Starting November 22nd:
