【明星推手賺基金2】驚嚇當紅明星竟口袋空空　小宣傳發憤靠4招滾存2000萬
06 Nov 2019, 22:05 by 劉以親, 王均峰
「我大學念書時就進唱片公司當宣傳帶藝人，當時唱片業一片榮景，在那個銷量可以破百萬張的年代，我看過很多藝人錢賺得快，但卻沒有存錢，甚至是叫得出名字的藝人也如此。」這現象讓明星經紀人倪良瑋覺得不可思議。



在演藝圈打轉20多年，經紀人倪良瑋看過太多藝人風光後的浮沉，「我其實不太干涉藝人的生活，因為每個人都有隱私，會發現藝人有財務問題，是當他們開口跟我借錢時。」
身為經紀人的他，每天不停幫藝人接工作，工作酬勞領多少一清二楚，「今天如果沒接到工作，沒收入倒也正常，可是，明明工作滿檔，怎麼可能會沒錢呢！那就像有一天郭台銘突然跟你說沒錢一樣，讓人很傻眼！」講完這個舉例，倪良瑋形容是誇張了點，但對他而言，驚嚇程度不相上下。
「看到藝人賺多卻守不住，這是一面鏡子，所以有錢會存起來，然後定時定額投資鎖進基金裡。」累積超過15年的基金投資經驗，至今滾存部位逾2,000萬元，倪良瑋分享以下4招成功心法。

第1招：基金養基金

倪良瑋表示，自己很愛存錢，家裡到處是大大小小的豬公存錢筒，重到小偷搬不走，而這個好習慣的養成，也落實在基金投資上，最近他剛把獲利2成的東歐基金，停利加碼投資印度基金，力行基金養基金操作術。

第2招：放大扣款額

「只要是我認同且看好後市的基金，月扣至少1萬5,000元，只扣3,000元的話，雖然市場不好時賠得不多，但一旦市場反轉向上，賺的絕對金額也不多，所以在有閒錢、能承擔風險的情況下，我會把扣款金額提高。」倪良瑋說 ，集中火力在好標的上，錢滾錢的威力很可觀。

第3招：負報酬不停扣

「賺錢的基金，我只停利不停扣，甚至還加碼扣；帳上賠錢的基金，我也是加碼繼續扣。」他提到，與很多投資人一樣，他也是貝萊德世礦的受傷者，一度慘賠40％，「但只要停扣就很難扳回績效。」目前這檔基金在他加碼攤平下，帳上損失收斂至10％左右。

第4招：首選新興國

「投資新興市場可以感受到它的開發跟成長，雖然沒有已開發國家穩定，但是只要押對標的，會有很好的投資報酬。」倪良瑋表示，他的第1檔基金是買摩根印度基金，紀律投資10多年下來，至少停利4次，光是獲利金額就超過100萬元。

[Star Pusher Earnings Fund 2] Frightened popular star is actually empty in the pocket. Small propaganda is angry and relies on 4 strokes to roll 20 million.
06 Nov 2019, 22:05 by Liu Yiqin, Wang Junfeng
""When I was in college, I entered the record company as a propaganda artist. At that time, the recording industry was in a glorious scene. In the era when sales could be broken by a million, I have seen many artists earning money quickly, but they have not saved money, or even called The same is true of the artist who got the name."" This phenomenon made the star agent Ni Liangwei feel incredible.



After more than 20 years in the entertainment industry, the agent Ni Lianglu has seen too many artists' scenery. ""I don't really interfere with the artist's life. Because everyone has privacy, they will find that the artists have financial problems. When they open their mouths with me. Money time.""
As a broker, he keeps helping artists to pick up his work every day, and how much work is paid for. ""If you don't get a job today, it's normal if you don't have income. But when you are full of work, how can you lose money?"" It’s like that one day, Guo Taiming suddenly told you that there is no money, it’s so dumbfounded!” After reading this example, Ni Liangwei described it as exaggerated, but for him, the degree of fright was comparable.
""Seeing that artists make more money but can't keep it, this is a mirror, so money will be saved, and then the fixed investment will be locked into the fund."" The accumulated fund investment experience of more than 15 years has so far surpassed 20 million yuan. Ni Liangzhu shared the following 4 strokes of success.


China, which has already paid for its actions, has let Ni Liangxi see future trends and economic growth, and thus buy Chinese funds. (Oriental IC)


The first move: fund raising fund

Ni Liangzhu said that he loves to save money. The family is full of pigs and magazines, big and small, and the thief can’t move. The development of this good habit is also implemented in fund investment. Recently he just made a profit 2 Into the Eastern European fund, the suspension of the investment in the Indian fund, and the implementation of fund management.

The second measure: amplify the amount of deduction

""As long as it is the fund that I agree with and is optimistic about the market, the monthly deduction is at least 15,000 yuan, and only 3,000 yuan is deducted. Although the market is not good when it is not good, once the market reverses upwards, the absolute amount earned is not much. Therefore, in the case of free cash and risk, I will increase the amount of deduction."" Ni Liangwei said that the concentration of firepower is on the right standard, and the power of money is very impressive.

The third measure: negative compensation does not stop

""For money-making funds, I only stop monetizing and even deducting the deduction; I am also overweight in the fund that has lost money on the account."" He mentioned that like many investors, he is also injured in the BlackRock Mine. However, it was a 40% loss. ""But as long as the suspension is stopped, it is very difficult to regain performance."" At present, the fund has been flattened by him, and the loss on the account has converged to about 10%.

4th move: preferred emerging country

""Investing in emerging markets can feel its development and growth. Although there is no stability in the developed countries, as long as the benchmarks are given, there will be good investment returns."" Ni Liangwei said that his first fund is to buy the Morgan India Fund. Disciplinary investment for more than 10 years, at least 4 times of suspension, the amount of profits is more than 1 million yuan.
