      <p>There are so many reasons to love leggings. But there's one negative thing about many leggings that's a deal breaker for a lot of us: they can be sheer. <a href="https://www.thezoereport.com/p/the-best-non-see-through-leggings-according-to-the-experts-16311697">Leggings that aren't see through</a> are absolutely priceless. Once you find a pair that won't make you look like you're flashing the neighborhood, you covet that pair forever and quickly become a loyal devotee of that brand. Because let's face it: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/everything-you-didnt-know-about-the-history-of-leggings-the-greatest-clothing-item-of-all-time-47445">leggings are the best</a>.</p>
      <p>To score leggings that aren't see through, it's important to consider the quality of the fabric. Thicker fabrics or leggings that are lined with fleece tend to be less transparent, but that isn't always the case. Some thin, well-made, and incredibly <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/16-comfiest-leggings-you-can-buy-right-now-37218">comfortable leggings</a> also happen to be opaque, so you can get away with wearing colorful <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/147209-11-underwear-hacks-every-woman-should-know">underwear</a> and no one will be the wiser.</p>
      <p>When shopping for leggings in a store, it always helps to put them through the stretch test: bend over in front a mirror and check out your behind, stretch your legs as far to the sky as you can without injuring yourself — these mini tests will ensure you know what you're getting into before you hit the pavement and unknowingly give everyone a show. And, when shopping online for leggings, reading reviews and paying close attention to top-rated merch (like these 12 opaque pairs of leggings) goes a long, long way.</p>
      <h3>1. Warm, High-Waisted Leggings: Conceited Premium Fleece-Lined Leggings</h3>

      </p>
      <p>If you're searching for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MFXDCZ0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle5134-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B01MFXDCZ0">warm pair of everyday leggings</a> to stock up on for winter, look no further. These fleece-lined leggings (which boast over 1,000 five-star reviews on Amazon) come in a variety of basic colors for every day wear. Though made of fleece, which <i>can</i> be suffocating, reviewers rave about how cozy they are — plus, they have a high-rise waistband for extra comfort. With a starting price of around $15 per pair, can you think of a better bargain?</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say: </b>"Great fit and so warm! Usually I'm not happy with wearing leggings because they pull down in the back and I'm constantly pulling them up but these have a high waist with a wide band."</p>
      <h3>2. Moisture-Wicking Athletic Leggings: Baleaf Women's High Waist Yoga Leggings</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/4/15/5b5ae000-a482-4b0b-91eb-40e32304f2b5-baleaf-high-waist-yoga-pants.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

      </p>
      <p>If you're planning on moving around a lot, these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071P97853?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle5134-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B071P97853">Baleaf yoga pants</a> move with you — without chafing, irritation, or over-heating. The anti-drop waist, flatlock seams, and gusseted crotch keep the pants in place and feeling comfortable while you squat, run, or pose. Then there's the four-way stretch fabric which wicks moisture and keeps you cool; you can even opt for mesh panels for improved ventilation. Get this pair in several colors and designs, all of which are totally "squat-proof," according to reviewers. Best of all, there's a hidden pocket.</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say: </b>"They fit wonderfully, and they're so comfortable I don't even feel like I'm wearing pants (wore them for my run tonight). The waistband comes up high enough to cover what I want covered without squeezing the hell out of my belly. Super breathable, moisture-wicking, not see-through!"</p>
      <h3>3. Soft, No-Fade Leggings: Kensie Legging Pant</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/8/22/edd1f07e-33eb-4bea-aa23-9c3598333e9f-6e3fe597-e853-40bd-b0ab-503f3809ebc3-kensie-womens-legging-pant.jpg?w=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>

      </p>
      <p>With a high elastic waistband and a full, ankle-length fit, these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006VYQU0S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle5134-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B006VYQU0S">leggings</a> won't dig into your skin and hold their shape over time. But one of the best features of these leggings, and one that is mentioned by reviewers time and time again, is that they retain their opaque black shade after many washes. So while other leggings fade to gray or off-black, these remain the same.</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say: </b>"I felt like I’d never find a pair of leggings outside [of] my expensive lulu lemons that wouldn’t be see through. These are actually opaque and looks nice enough that If I pair them with a tunic and pair of nice boots I look dressed up enough for a business casual office."</p>
      <h3>4. Stretchy Graphic Leggings: VIV Collection Printed Leggings</h3>

Both styles feature an elastic waistband and one reviewer describes the material as "stunning." Don't be put off by the "one size fits all" model: reviewers who vary in sizes say these leggings may look small in the package, but they are super stretchy and accommodating — plus many are available in plus sizes.</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say: </b>"I have not bought another brand of leggings since finding these a few months back. They feel great when wearing, truly like a second skin. Buttery soft is not an exaggeration. Gorgeous prints to choose from. This is my third time purchasing different style prints. Hard to decide which to buy first. You will receive admiring comments. They are that pretty."</p>

With this pair, you can choose between eight sizes, three waist options, and three height options. They're also available in black or dark heather gray, and buyers say they're excited to finally find a pair of leggings "that not only fit but that are obviously not see through!"</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say: </b>"I actually do yoga in my yoga pants (as well as wear them everywhere else from work to hiking to lounging) and these are perfect, the waist band is the most comfortable one I own, fabric is soft, and most importantly opaque for all the downward dogs, happy babies, and goddess squats in my life."</p>
