Tottenham star Son Heung-min has opened up on his ""really tough few days"" after the challenge which caused Andre Gomes to suffer a horrific ankle injury.
Everton midfielder Gomes has undergone successful surgery on a fracture dislocation on his right ankle and been released from hospital after suffering the injury at Goodison Park on Sunday.
South Korean star Son left the field in tears and inconsolable after being sent off for the sliding tackle which caused the Portuguese international to fall awkwardly.
Son, who has had his red card overturned by an independent panel after an appeal, scored twice as Spurs beat Red Star Belgrade 4-0 in the Champions League.
He appeared to apologise as he celebrated his opening goal before saying he is ""really, really sorry"" for the ""accident"" that took place.

""I'm really, really sorry for this accident and the situation.
""Of course, I have to focus on the team and respect the football.
