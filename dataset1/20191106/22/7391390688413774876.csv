12 Leggings That Aren't See Through

06 Nov 2019, 22:37

There are so many reasons to love leggings. But there's one negative thing about many leggings that's a deal breaker for a lot of us: they can be sheer. Leggings that aren't see through are absolutely priceless. Once you find a pair that won't make you look like you're flashing the neighborhood, you covet that pair forever and quickly become a loyal devotee of that brand. Because let's face it: leggings are the best.
To score leggings that aren't see through, it's important to consider the quality of the fabric. Thicker fabrics or leggings that are lined with fleece tend to be less transparent, but that isn't always the case. Some thin, well-made, and incredibly comfortable leggings also happen to be opaque, so you can get away with wearing colorful underwear and no one will be the wiser.
When shopping for leggings in a store, it always helps to put them through the stretch test: bend over in front a mirror and check out your behind, stretch your legs as far to the sky as you can without injuring yourself — these mini tests will ensure you know what you're getting into before you hit the pavement and unknowingly give everyone a show. And, when shopping online for leggings, reading reviews and paying close attention to top-rated merch (like these 12 opaque pairs of leggings) goes a long, long way.
1. Warm, High-Waisted Leggings: Conceited Premium Fleece-Lined Leggings

If you're searching for a warm pair of everyday leggings to stock up on for winter, look no further. These fleece-lined leggings (which boast over 1,000 five-star reviews on Amazon) come in a variety of basic colors for every day wear. Though made of fleece, which can be suffocating, reviewers rave about how cozy they are — plus, they have a high-rise waistband for extra comfort. With a starting price of around $15 per pair, can you think of a better bargain?
Reviewers say: ""Great fit and so warm! Usually I'm not happy with wearing leggings because they pull down in the back and I'm constantly pulling them up but these have a high waist with a wide band.""
2. Moisture-Wicking Athletic Leggings: Baleaf Women's High Waist Yoga Leggings

If you're planning on moving around a lot, these Baleaf yoga pants move with you — without chafing, irritation, or over-heating. The anti-drop waist, flatlock seams, and gusseted crotch keep the pants in place and feeling comfortable while you squat, run, or pose. Then there's the four-way stretch fabric which wicks moisture and keeps you cool; you can even opt for mesh panels for improved ventilation. Get this pair in several colors and designs, all of which are totally ""squat-proof,"" according to reviewers. Best of all, there's a hidden pocket.
Reviewers say: ""They fit wonderfully, and they're so comfortable I don't even feel like I'm wearing pants (wore them for my run tonight). The waistband comes up high enough to cover what I want covered without squeezing the hell out of my belly. Super breathable, moisture-wicking, not see-through!""
3. Soft, No-Fade Leggings: Kensie Legging Pant

With a high elastic waistband and a full, ankle-length fit, these leggings won't dig into your skin and hold their shape over time. But one of the best features of these leggings, and one that is mentioned by reviewers time and time again, is that they retain their opaque black shade after many washes. So while other leggings fade to gray or off-black, these remain the same.
Reviewers say: ""I felt like I’d never find a pair of leggings outside [of] my expensive lulu lemons that wouldn’t be see through. These are actually opaque and looks nice enough that If I pair them with a tunic and pair of nice boots I look dressed up enough for a business casual office.""
