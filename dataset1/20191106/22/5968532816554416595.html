      <p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-halloween-movies-netflix-1002107/">Halloween</a> is old news now, and the holiday shopping season is officially upon us. To kick off this year’s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> news, Target has announced its <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74660X1524607&amp;xcust=jimmy.westenberg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fweeklyad.target.com%2Fpromotions%3Fcode%3DTarget-20191106%26lnk%3DBlackFridaysnea%26page%3DD">Pixel 4 deal</a>, and boy is it good.</p>
      <p>Customers who purchase a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review-1040903/">Google Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL</a> from Target will also receive a <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74660X1524607&amp;xcust=jimmy.westenberg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fweeklyad.target.com%2Fpromotions%3Fcode%3DTarget-20191106%26lnk%3DBlackFridaysnea%26page%3DD">$300 Target gift card</a>. To qualify for the gift card, users will need to activate the Pixel device on either AT&amp;T or Verizon with a 24-30 month payment plan.</p>
      <p>There’s also a decent deal for those who don’t mind last year’s tech. <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3-xl-review-911391/">Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL</a> purchases will come with a whopping $550 Target gift card under the same stipulations as the Pixel 4 deal. That’s enough money to cover the rest of your holiday shopping.</p>
      <p>Both the Pixel 4 and Pixel 3 Black Friday deals are only available from November 28 to December 1. Also, devices are not returnable without also returning the gift card, so make your purchase wisely.</p>
      <p>There will definitely be more Pixel 4 Black Friday deals in the coming weeks, but it will be hard for other retailers to top Target’s sale this year.</p>
