Colin Farrell in Talks to Play Batman’s Sexy Penguin Nemesis
06 Nov 2019, 22:08 by Jordan Crucchiola
Does Robert Pattinson’s Batman have a new nemesis? Perhaps. According to Deadline, Colin Farrell is in talks for the role of the Penguin for Matt Reeves’s The Batman, which has Robert Pattinson in the titular role and recently cast Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman and Paul Dano as the Riddler. (Give us the bodysuits!!) You will remember also that this is the Batman film Jonah Hill is not in, in case you’ve lost track of your DC movies and your batmen. The last time we saw Penguin on the big screen he was being played by Danny DeVito, who brings a considerably different vibe than Farrell, but this is not the actor’s first time in the superhero sphere. He previously played the card-slinging Bullseye in Ben Affleck’s Daredevil — an era we will not let them forget!
