      <p>Moscow -<b>Â </b>Substitute<b> Douglas Costa's</b> injury-time winner secured <b>Juventus </b>their spot in the<b> Champions League</b> last 16 on Wednesday after a 2-1 victory over <b>Lokomotiv Moscow</b>.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian winger struck a magnificent, last-gasp solo goal for the Italian champions after Aleksei Miranchuk had cancelled out Aaron Ramsey's fourth-minute opener.</p>
      <p>Juve are three points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of Group D ahead of the Spanish side's game at Bayer Leverkusen, who will likely battle Lokomotiv for a Europa League place.</p>
      <p>Lokomotiv coach Yuri Semin made one change from the weekend's draw at Ufa as on-loan Inter Milan midfielder Joao Mario came in for Murilo Cerqueira.</p>
      <p>Juve's Maurizio Sarri brought in seven new faces from Saturday's Turin derby victory which included handing Wales midfielder Ramsey his first start for the club in the competition.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, whose appearances for his new side this season have been restricted by injury, opened the scoring early after Lokomotiv goalkeeper Guilherme fumbled Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo fired his effort from the corner of the box straight at Guilherme who spilled the ball through his legs, allowing Ramsey to poke home from the goal-line on the greasy surface.</p>
      <p>The Russians equalised eight minutes later after Juve took their foot off the gas.</p>
      <p>Maciej Rybus whipped a cross towards Miranchuk who tapped in unopposed with Wojciech Szczesny on the floor after his header bounced back off the post.</p>
      <p>The equaliser seemed to inspire Lokomotiv and they could have taken the lead less than 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Miranchuk wasted a chance to double his tally after glancing his header over the crossbar from a chipped cross by Rifat Zhemaletdinov.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo troubled Guilherme from a set-piece once again three minutes into the second half, the Brazil-born Russia international nervously parrying away the long-range effort.</p>
      <p>Guilherme denied Ronaldo again nine minutes later sending the Portugal attacker's powerful shot over the bar with an impressive save.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was substituted off for Paulo Dybala on 82 minutes with Sarri potentially keeping an eye on Sunday's Serie A game against AC Milan, despite the former Real Madrid forward's frustration at the decision.</p>
      <p>Juve dominated the final moments and Costa clinched their sixth straight last 16 appearance with a tidy side-footed finish in injury time for his first Bianconeri goal since January.</p>
