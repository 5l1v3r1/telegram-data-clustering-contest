Does reading improve childhood health? Nonprofit proves it can

BOSTON - We all know reading is fundamental, but can reading improve health outcomes? For 30 years, Reach Out and Read has proven it can. 
The national nonprofit started at Boston City Hospital, now Boston Medical Center, in 1989 with a group of pediatricians who gave parents the knowledge and the tools they need to make reading to their children a daily routine. 
""We make sure the child is growing and sleeping and doesn't have rashes, but fundamentally, what we're doing is supporting that incredible energy that parents bring to need to nurture their kids,"" said Dr. Robert Needlman, founder of Reach Out and Read.
Now, the program is in all 50 states and works to educate health care providers. 



""That social connection and that education connection. The cognitive development that it allows, I think that's just so important,"" said Susan Etyemezian, mother of two. 
Boston 25 News found Etyemezian and her kids Alique and Arik in one of their favorite places — the Boston Public Library. 
""We take our bath, then we put on our pajamas, and we read books. It's just something that I have tried to do since she was born, which people may think I'm crazy,"" said Etyemezian. 
She's not crazy. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends reading to kids beginning at birth to improve learning, speech, and overall development. Also, parents who participate in reading out loud also come to more regular check-ups and well visits. 
Reach Out and Read serves nearly five million children every year across the United States and about half of them are considered low income. 
Needlman says there's more to do. Literacy rates nationwide, including in Massachusetts, have not improved much in the last three decades. 
""When we started Reach Out and Read 35% of kids were showing up at school unprepared to succeed. These days, it's about 35%,"" he said. 
Thirty years later and back in Boston where it all began, Needlman says he considers Reach Out and Read a social justice program giving all families access to books and literacy. 
""Think about pediatricians as partners in this really important work of making sure that every child really grows up with access to richness of our cultures,"" said Needlman.
