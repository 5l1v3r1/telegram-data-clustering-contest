DJ Snake And Zedd Lead Ultra Australia’s Bumper 2020 Line-Up
06 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Junkee
‘Clarity’ hitmaker Zedd and DJ Snake have been locked in to headline the second ever edition of Ultra Australia next March.
The dance festival juggernaut officially landed in the country last year, after a Road to Ultra event the year before. By the looks of it, it’s here to stay: the 2020 bill will also feature Dutch producer Afrojack, along with Jeffrey Sutorius, who’s coming with his new solo project The Return Of Dash Berlin.
Eric Prydz will appear on the main stage, while his techno alias Cirez D will headline the Resistance Stage. He’ll be joined there by Italian tech powerhouse Deborah de Luca, Eats Everything, Luciano, and UMEK.
Ultra Australia hit Sydney on Saturday March 7 and Melbourne on March 8 — tickets are on sale now, and will set you back $160 for general admission.
