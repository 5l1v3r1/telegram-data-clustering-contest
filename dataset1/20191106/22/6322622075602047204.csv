06 Nov 2019, 22:35 by Reuters
MILAN (Nov 7): Manchester City were made to wait to book a place in the Champions League knockout stages after Atalanta came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at San Siro on Wednesday.
Raheem Sterling finished off a flowing City move early on before Gabriel Jesus squandered a golden chance to double their lead by rolling a tame penalty wide on the brink of halftime.
Pep Guardiola’s side were made to pay for their profligacy when Mario Pasalic’s bullet header levelled the scores early in the second half.
The home side threatened to snatch a winner after substitute City keeper Claudio Bravo was sent off late on, to be replaced in goal by outfield player Kyle Walker for the closing stages.
City remain top of Group C with 10 points, five ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk and Dinamo Zagreb, while the draw earned Atalanta their first point in the competition. - Reuters
