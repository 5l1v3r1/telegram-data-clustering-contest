美官員:階段貿易談判尚未談妥 川習或12月簽協議

06 Nov 2019, 22:11

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】路透社週三（11月6日）報導稱，美國行政部門一位高層官員稱，美中首階段協議的一些條款和首腦會面地點仍未談妥，不排除這項協議最終無法達成的可能性，但達成協議的可能性還是比較高。
這位要求匿名的官員說，美國總統川普（特朗普）與中國國家主席習近平可能延後到今年12月會面並簽署這份首階段貿易協議。
至於兩位國家元首會面的具體地點，該官員披露，包括瑞典和瑞士在內，有多達數十個備選地點，其中歐洲的地點被選中的可能性比較高，川普早前提出的愛荷華州（Iowa）似乎已經排除在外。
當天，亞洲股市小幅回落，有分析認為這是投資者在等待中美貿易談判的新進展。
據公開的資訊，11月6日，MSCI明晟亞太地區(除日本)指數跌0.11%；澳洲股市跌0.09%；中國滬深300指數.CSI300則跌0.08%，唯日本的日經指數.N225上漲了0.2%。
美國公債收益率在亞洲時段小幅下跌，原油期貨價格也下滑。有媒體分析稱，這表明在美中談判官員繼續努力敲定初步貿易協議之際，投資者「稍事喘息」。
此前公布的美國服務業數據優於預期，但一些分析師警告指出，單靠這點難以打消對全球經濟前景的疑慮。

As for the specific location of the meeting of the two heads of state, the official disclosed that there are dozens of alternative locations, including Sweden and Switzerland, of which the possibility of being selected in Europe is relatively high, Trump proposed earlier.

US Treasury yields fell slightly during the Asian session, and crude oil futures prices also fell. According to media analysis, this indicates that investors are ""suddenly breathing"" as US and Chinese negotiators continue to work hard to finalize the preliminary trade agreement.
