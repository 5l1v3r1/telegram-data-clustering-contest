Spain are into the quarterfinals of the U17 World Cup after goals from Roberto Navarro and Germán Valera helped them beat Senegal 2-1 in Brazil on Wednesday.
Former Barcelona youngster Navarro, now at Real Sociedad via a short stop in Monaco, set La Roja on their way to the last eight after linking well with another ex-La Masia player, Pablo Moreno.
David Gordo's side doubled their lead after the break when Atletico Madrid's Valera found the back of the net, set up by Barcelona's Ilaix Moriba.
Senegal pulled a goal back in the 85th minute Souleymane Faye but it was too little, too late for the African nation, who exited the competition.
Spain, though, march on. They will play the winners of the match between France and Australia in the last eight on Nov. 11.
