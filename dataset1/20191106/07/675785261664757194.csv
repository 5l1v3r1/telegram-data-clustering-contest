What channel is Red Star Belgrade vs Tottenham on? TV and live stream information
Spurs head to Serbia after thrashing Red Star a fortnight ago to keep their Champions League hopes alive
06 Nov 2019, 07:30 by Sam Fletcher
It’s been a mixed start for Tottenham in the UEFA Champions League this season but they remain on course to qualify for the knockout stages at the halfway point of the Group Stage.
A draw against Olympiakos and a battering by Bayern saw Spurs slumping towards an early Champions League exit before a resurgence against Red Star Belgrade now sees them firmly back in the mix.
Yet they were in a worse situation last season, only picking up a point from their opening three fixtures and they still ended up competing in June's final against Liverpool .
Pochettino has come under a lot of pressure with his side currently sitting in the bottom half of the Premier League, out of the Carabao Cup and making a routine Champions League group look difficult. His side desperately need a win.
Here’s all you need to know ahead of the game…
