      <p>The Catalan club were held to a 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou on Tuesday, in a display that earned boos from the home support, and had many fans calling for manager Ernesto Valverde to be sacked.Â </p>
      <p>The team's drab performance in Europe followed a disappointing 3-1 away loss to Levante in LaLiga, which was the team's third league defeat of the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Wenger, who is yet to return to the game as a manager after leaving Arsenal in 2018, believes Barcelona have lost their fluidity and charm, and suggesed there is too much dependence on captain Messi.</p>

      <p>"(Despite being) leaders of La Liga and their Champions League group... they are playing like a team in crisis, because the play is too slow, without dynamism, and very individualistic in the final meters," he said, according to <i>Sport</i>.</p>
      <p>"When they lose the ball, they could concede a goal on the counter because they aren't closing down the space for the opponent.</p>
      <p>"Barcelona are an interesting case because they have a history of brilliant collective team play and then they also had Leo Messi, who made the difference.</p>
      <p>"Today, it seems they play expecting something from Messi. Before the music was beautiful, of a fantastic team waiting for Messi to appear.</p>
      <p>"Today, they have lost their charisma and you have to ask how much the last two Champions League failures have affected them. From outside, it seems they've lost their charisma."</p>
