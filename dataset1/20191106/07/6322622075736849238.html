      <p>BENGALURU (Nov 6): Analysts trimmed their 2019 earnings forecasts for Asian companies by a smaller margin over the past month, Refinitiv data showed, as optimism for the Sino-US trade deal soothed some nerves.</p>
      <p>Over the past 30 days, analysts have lowered earnings outlook for Asia's large and mid-cap firms' by 0.1% due to slowing economic growth in the region, the data showed.</p>
      <p>However, the cut was much lower than the 2.7% downgrade in the previous two months.</p>
      <p>India, Japan and Australia led the downgrades in the region over the past month, according to the data.</p>
      <p>"Declining commodity prices and weak consumer sentiment point to earnings revision weakness in Australia," said Goldman Sachs in a report this month, adding that its Asia-ex-Japan economic sentiment index has fallen further, which may indicate lack of confidence in the economy.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, analysts upgraded their earnings outlook for Chinese and Taiwanese firms by an average of 1.4% and 1.3% respectively, the data showed.</p>
      <p>Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a year in the third quarter, as a rebound in demand for tech products for the year-end peak season boosted manufacturers and "offset" the impact of trade disputes.</p>
