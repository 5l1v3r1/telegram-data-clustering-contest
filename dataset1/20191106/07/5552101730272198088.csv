台北市長柯文哲組成台灣民眾黨後，將目標放在搶攻國會席次，近日更以海選方式尋找不分區立委。其中立委黃國昌一直以來與柯文哲保持良好關係，先前就曾傳出黃國昌可能加入民眾黨等消息。今（6）日民眾黨發起人蔡壁如受訪時表示，會建議黨提名委員會邀請黃國昌，若他願意加入，「不分區一定給他第一名」。
蔡壁如今（6）日接受《蘋果新聞網》直播節目《蘋果劈大選》專訪時，談到最近無殼蝸牛運動30週年與居住正義等問題，強調時代力量立委黃國昌也一直都有關注此議題，而其政見想法與台灣民眾黨非常相近。

訪談過程中，蔡壁如也談到不分區立委問題，「據說時力把黃國昌列在不分區4至6名，這其實有點危險。」蔡壁如分析指出，黃國昌在國會相當有戰力，在居住正義方面也可以與民眾黨合作，將會建議黨提名委員會邀請黃國昌，若他願意加入，「不分區一定給他第一名」。
此外，蔡壁如也不忘談到時代力量的困境，「出走的出走、內鬨的內鬨」，某些區立委提名又退出。對新成立的民眾黨來說，要讓黨對黨談合作有困難，不過她相當欣賞黃國昌，應該要請黃加入民眾黨。
