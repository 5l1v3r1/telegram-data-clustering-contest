An Aquired Taste: Hilarious Golden Retriever Pup Licks Everything

06 Nov 2019, 07:30


Sometimes, doggos can be really hungry, so they eat everything they see. But this apparently well-fed pup looks like he is trying to become a canine vacuum cleaner. No need to clean up when you have such an eager helper pitching in with the housework.

This little goofy golden retriever doesn’t look hungry at all – but it surely wants to taste everything – including computers, furniture, and floors. Fortunately, the doggo is not chewing on these items, it is just licking them clean- maybe his owner will appreciate the pups cleaning skills.
