On KBC Amitabh Bachchan forced to recreate scene from Coolie on KBC, watch what Jaya Bachchan and son Abhishek had said on accident

An old video of famous TV host Simi Grewal interviewing KBC host Amitabh Bachchan about his life-threatening accident while shooting Coolie recently trended on the internet. The highlight of the interview was the revelation on Jaya Bachchan’s revelation that son Abhishek almost had a nervous breakdown after one of his friends teased him saying that his father was going to die soon. Days after the Simi Grewal’s old interview trended, Bachchan was forced to recreate a famous dialogue from that ill-fated film.



The KBC host had no option but to walk down memory lane as he asked one of his contestants a question about his 1983 blockbuster Coolie. One of his questions during a recent episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati was about a famous character from the film.
The question read, “Who is Allah Rakha in the film ‘Coolie’?” The options were ‘an elephant,’ ‘a bird,’ ‘a dog,’ and ‘a child.’ The correct answer was ‘a bird’ and the contestant had little trouble in answering the question.
Bachchan explained, “There was a popular dialogue from the film Coolie. Bachpan se hai sar par Allah ka haath aur Allah Rakha hai mere saath. (I have the blessings of Allah since my childhood because I have Allah Rakha with me).”
Soon after the popular KBC host delivered the famous dialogue from Coolie, the contestant said that he had not seen a single celebrity, who could speak in Hindi with as much ease and confidence as in English. This left the Bollywood megastar blushing.
Bachchan recreating the popular scene from the 1983 hit film evoked a huge round of applause from the KBC audience. Directed by Manmohan Desai and Prayag Raj, Coolie’s screenplay was written by Kader Khan and KK Shukla.



Bachchan had sustained a life-threatening injury during the shooting of the film. While shooting an intense fight sequence with his co-star Puneet Issar at the Bangalore University campus, Bachchan was badly injured after he misjudged the jump and landed abruptly, leaving him severely injured. The edge of the table had hit his abdomen causing massive internal hemorrhage and internal bleeding. He had to be rushed to a hospital in Mumbai, where he had to undergo multiple surgeries. By his own admission, the doctors had declared him clinically dead for a few minutes before placing him on the ventilator. Writing in his blog, Bachchan had once said that he wasn’t responding to any kind of treatment for almost a week.
His fans had taken to temples and mosques praying for his recovery.



Last year, Bachchan had shared the visuals of his homecoming from the hospital. In one video he was seen being welcomed by his emotional parents and children. He was then heard saying, “Today the 24th of September is exactly two months from the date when I was injured and I sit here before you as a result of the efforts of the doctors from (Breach Candy Hospital).”
He went on to resume the shooting of Coolie after staying in the hospital for more than two months. As expected, the film went on to become a huge hit.
