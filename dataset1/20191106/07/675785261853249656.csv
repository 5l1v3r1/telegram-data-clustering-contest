David Beckham wowed his kids Harper, Brooklyn and Cruz with a ""fun night of fireworks"".
The happy dad, 44, ensured they had the best view from the rooftop of Television Centre in White City, London on Bonfire Night on Tuesday.
They cuddled up close for a sweet family photograph, offset by the bright fireworks going off in the background.
Clearly having a great time, David shared a montage of videos from the rooftop with three of his children onto his Instagram page.
However, the former footballer admitted he was missing his absent son Romeo and his wife Victoria on the special occasion.

The famous family were straight back on the social scene in London after spending Halloween in Los Angeles.
Victoria remained in the UK while David took the children to Los Angeles for half term.
Harper had enjoyed a magical spell of trick-or-treating at newly weds Justin and Hailey Bieber's home, in Los Angeles.
David wrote of their trip on Instagram: ""Thanks @justinbieber & Haileybieber someone got her snow cone.""
