      <p>MOODY, Ala. (AP) — The son of an Alabama prosecutor has been shot to death on an interstate.</p>
      <p>News outlets report that 20-year-old Nicholas Sloan Harmon was found with a fatal gunshot wound inside a car at an exit off Interstate 20 on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>St. Clair County Coroner Dennis Russell says Harmon was the son of District Attorney Lyle Harmon, who serves as the chief prosecutor in the county just east of Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Authorities haven’t said what might have led to the shooting, which happened in Moody.</p>
      <p>Al.com reports a suspect was arrested in nearby Pell City early Wednesday after a search that lasted hours.</p>
      <p>The victim’s father was appointed district attorney earlier this year after the former prosecutor joined a state appeals court.</p>
