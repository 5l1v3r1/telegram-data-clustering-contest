      <p>615,000 people face a third day of boiling their water today in Dublin, Kildare and Meath.</p>
      <p>Testing at the Leixlip treatment plant is continuing, after heavy weekend rain affected water quality and triggered a major boil water notice.</p>
      <p>The boil water notice will not end until tomorrow at the very earliest.</p>
      <p>Three test results proving acceptable quality levels must come back before the ban can be lifted.</p>
      <p>The final sample is due later this evening, when a decision will then be taken by health authorities on the boil water notice.</p>
      <p>The affected householders were impacted by a separate three day ban just two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Now Irish Water is warning of further boil water notices for people served by the Leixlip plant, until it is upgraded.</p>
      <p>That is due to be done next summer.</p>
