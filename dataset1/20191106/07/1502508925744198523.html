      <p>State-owned <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ntpc">NTPC </a>on Wednesday said it is working on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-electric-vehicle">electric vehicle </a>charging infrastructure as it believes that ultimately mobility through EVs will help.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ntpc">NTPC </a>Executive Director Mohit Bhargava said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-electric-vehicle">electric vehicle </a>is a good concept but the larger issue is related to the battery.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ntpc">NTPC </a>is working very strongly on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-electric-vehicle">electric vehicle </a>(EV) side. On the charging network side," Bhargava said addressing<br/><br/>India Energy Summit here.</p>
      <p>"There is a larger issue on the battery side...the life of the battery and how do you reuse the battery," he added.</p>
      <p>NTPC had earlier said it has signed pacts with cab aggregators Ola, Lithium, Shuttl, Bikxie, Bounce, Electrie and Zoom Car for creation of public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>The collaboration with these aggregators will lead to development of charging infrastructure for various vehicle segments as well as effective utilisation of public charging infrastructure, NTPC had said.</p>
