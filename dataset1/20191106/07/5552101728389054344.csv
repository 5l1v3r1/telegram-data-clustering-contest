【綠不分區角力】傳納不分區拚國會議長　游錫堃：不忮不求
06 Nov 2019, 07:04 by 黃揚明, 鄒保祥
民進黨下屆不分區名單預計下週三（13日）中執會中提出，由於立法院長蘇嘉全不願被列入不分區名單內，黨內盛傳前行政院長游錫堃可能排入安全名單中，未來若綠營能取得過半國會席次，游將成為內定國會議長人選。對此，游錫堃今回應，他「不忮不求」。
民進黨主席卓榮泰下午表示，目前不分區提名委員會已開過幾次會議，漸漸進入到個別人選的討論，但「個別人選的問題，我們還沒有進一步確認。」
黨內人士表示，因台北市長柯文哲的台灣民眾黨來勢洶洶，加上時代力量、一邊一國連線等泛綠小黨分食政黨票，這次民進黨不分區安全名單最壞可能僅有10至12名的空間，加上許多現任立委爭取列入，恐難有亮點人物排入安全名單。
民進黨現任區域立委中，包括黨團總召柯建銘、立委管碧玲、蘇震清、李俊俋、葉宜津等人都爭取列入不分區名單中，其中以柯建銘、管碧玲列入安全名單機會最大。


民進黨團總召柯建銘被黨內認為會列入不分區立委安全名單。

蘇震清因捲入誠美材掏空案，導致黨內憂心若排入不分區恐不易衝政黨票；李俊俋、葉宜津雖有戰力，但缺乏派系奧援，要排入安全名單要靠伯樂相挺。
現任不分區立委包括施義芳、邱泰源、林靜儀、周春米、吳玉琴、王榮璋、李麗芬、余宛如、陳靜敏、鍾孔炤等都爭取續任，目前以施義芳、邱泰源、林靜儀、周春米列入安全名單呼聲較高。
今年7月因蘇嘉全表態不爭取連任立委，因此黨內高層規劃由游錫堃排入不分區名單中，若國會過半就成為立法院長內定人選。不過，由於游錫堃並未積極表態爭取，且傳出游所率領的正國會系統仍想爭取另一席不分區空間，加上近期因蘇震清是否列入不分區在黨內引發爭議，黨內高層有意讓蘇嘉全續任，以便布局，但蘇再次聲明不願續任，又讓游列入的機率大增。游錫堃今向本刊表示：「不忮不求。」
其餘可能列入不分區安全人選還包括新系支持的新北市前議員沈發惠以及社民黨前召集人范雲。據透露，目前黨內苦於不分區名單缺乏「亮點」，因此希望各派系推薦女性、具勞工議題領域背景的優秀人才，希望除了范雲以外，能有更亮眼的不分區名單，以利於爭取更多政黨票。
民進黨不分區提名經歷幾番波折，先是不分區提名委員會名單引發派系不滿，導致10月16日中執會因出席人數不足流會，延後一週至10月23日才成立提名委員會。再加上爭取列入不分區的立委蘇震清因捲入誠美材掏空案，經廉政委員會邀蘇說明後，確認暫不立案。
民進黨不分區提名委員會成員包括：卓榮泰（召集人），基隆市長林右昌、蔡英文總統連任競選總部總幹事林錫耀、總統府祕書長陳菊、總統府資政陳博志、民進黨仲裁會委員陳傳岳、文化部長鄭麗君、行政院長蘇貞昌。

[Green does not divide the wrestling] to pass the conference without the division of the country. You Xizhen: Do not ask for it.
06 Nov 2019, 07:04 by Huang Yangming, Zou Baoxiang
The next non-partitioned list of the DPP is expected to be proposed in the middle of the next Wednesday (13th). As the president of the Legislative Yuan, Su Jiaquan, is not willing to be included in the non-partition list, the former president of the party, Yu Xizhen, may be placed on the safe list. If Green Camp can get more than half of the parliamentary seats, the tour will become the candidate for the president of the country. In this regard, Yu Xizhen responded today, and he ""does not ask for it.""
The DPP chairman, Zhuo Rongtai, said in the afternoon that the non-division nomination committee has already held several meetings and gradually entered the discussion of individual candidates. However, ""the question of individual candidates has not been further confirmed.""
People inside the party said that because the Taipei mayor Ke Wenzhe’s Taiwan People’s Party came to the forefront, plus the power of the times and the one-country connection, such as the small green party to eat party votes, the Democratic Party’s list of non-partition security may be only 10 With a space of 12, plus many incumbent legislators for inclusion, it is difficult to have bright spots on the safe list.
Among the current regional legislators of the DPP, including the party generals Cao Jianming, the legislator Guan Biling, Su Zhenqing, Li Junxi, Ye Yijin and others all strive to be included in the non-partition list, among which Ke Jianming and Guan Biling are the most likely to be included in the safety list.


The general election of the DPP group, Ke Jianming, was considered by the party to be included in the safety list of the non-divisional legislators.

Su Zhenqing was involved in the short-selling case of Chengmei, which made it difficult for the party to worry about arranging into the non-partitions. It is not easy to rush the party votes; although Li Junyi and Ye Yijin have the strength, but they lack the faction to support the Olympics, it is necessary to rely on Bole.
The current non-divisional legislators including Shi Yifang, Qiu Taiyuan, Lin Jingyi, Zhou Chunmi, Wu Yuqin, Wang Rongzhen, Li Lifen, Yu Wanru, Chen Jingmin, Zhong Kongyu, etc. are all vying to renew their duties. Currently, Shi Yifang, Qiu Taiyuan, Lin Jingyi and Zhou Chunmi are listed as safety. The list is louder.
In July this year, Su Jia’s statement was not to seek re-election. Therefore, the party’s high-level planning was placed in the non-partitioned list by Yu Xizhen. If the Congress is over half, it will become the final choice of the legislature. However, because You Xizhen did not actively fight for it, and the official parliamentary system led by the travel agency still wants to win another non-partition space, plus the recent dispute over whether Su Zhenqing is included in the party, the party’s top officials intend to let Su Jiaquan Renewed for the sake of layout, but Sue once again stated that he would not be renewed, and the chances of including the tour were greatly increased. Yu Xizhen said to the magazine today: ""I don't want to ask.""
The rest may be included in the non-segment security candidates, including the former New Century City Councilor Shen Fahui and the former Social Democratic Party convener Fan Yun. According to reports, the current lack of ""bright spots"" in the party's list of non-partitions, I hope that the factions will recommend women and talented people with backgrounds in the field of labor issues. I hope that in addition to Fan Yun, there will be a more conspicuous list of non-partitions in order to facilitate the fight. More party votes.
The DPP’s no-nomination nominations experienced several twists and turns. First, the list of no-nomination committees caused dissatisfaction with the faction. As a result, the mid-definition session of the Central Committee on October 16 was delayed due to insufficient attendance, and the nomination committee was established one week later until October 23. In addition, Su Zhenqing, a legislator who strives to be included in the non-partition, was involved in the short-selling case of Chengmei. After the invitation of the Integrity Commission, he confirmed that he would not file the case.
Members of the DPP Nominating Nominating Committee include: Zhuo Rongtai (convener), Keelung Mayor Lin Youchang, President Cai English, re-elected as Director-General of the Headquarters, Lin Xiyao, Presidential Office Secretary Chen Ju, Presidential Office, Chen Bozhi, and Democratic Progressive Party Arbitration Committee member Chen Chuanyue, Culture Minister Zheng Lijun, and Executive Dean Su Yuchang.
