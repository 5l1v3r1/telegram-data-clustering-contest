      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING DETAILS: Grace Millane's dad weeped in court as he heard details of how his daughter's body was found in Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T07:40:33+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 07:40</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Benjamin Cooper, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A British backpacker's father wiped away tears as a court heard his daughter's naked body was found twisted inside a suitcase "in the foetal position" a week after she went missing.</p>
      <p>Grace Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she arrived in New Zealand last November and went on a Tinder date with the man now accused of her murder.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly strangled Ms Millane while they had rough sex at his apartment in the centre of Auckland.</p>
      <p>A police officer who discovered Ms Millane's body told Auckland High Court that he found the Brit buried in a shallow grave after tracking mobile phone data to a chain of hills called the Waitakere Ranges.</p>

      <p>Detective Evan Ingley said the grave was 30-50ft into dense bush off a gravel car park, <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/grace-millane-murder-trial-police-officer-describes-finding-suitcase-in-shallow-grave">1 News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The officer told the trial: "I could see an area of ferns and some trees that looked like they'd been broken off and placed on top of an area ... they were piled on there haphazardly."</p>
      <p>Jurors were shown photos of a large, light-coloured suitcase in the grave with broken sticks and branches nearby.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Lewis Sin told the court the suitcase was sitting in a small puddle with a "light red substance" seeping through, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/117201085/grace-millane-murder-trial-british-backpacker-constantly-communicated-with-family-court-hears">Stuff.co.nz</a> reported.</p>
      <p>A doctor confirmed human remains were inside the suitcase.</p>

      <p>Before Ms Millane's body was forensically examined the suitcase was taken to Auckland Morgue.</p>
      <p>DC Sin, who accompanied the suitcase to the morgue, said Ms Millane's naked body was "in the foetal position" and "tightly packed" in a suitcase and she had been wearing black nail polish.</p>
      <p>Ms Millane's mother, Gillian Millane, clutched a tissue over her mouth as Mr Sin said that earrings and a small metal tag inscribed with the word "freedom" were also found inside the suitcase.</p>
      <p>Her father, David, wiped tears as the court heard details about how she was found.</p>
      <p>The defence claims the death, on either December 1 or December 2, 2018, the date of Ms Millane's 22nd birthday, was accidental.</p>

      <p>Crown prosecutor Robin McCoubrey countered that, saying: "strangling someone to death with your hands isn't inadvertent - all of the evidence points away from an accident".</p>
      <p>The defendant allegedly first told police that the pair met for a drink then parted ways, but later admitted they engaged in rough sex involving biting and hitting which finished on the floor.</p>
      <p>However, he insisted he did not realise she had died and had a shower before going back to bed.</p>
      <p>"'I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor. I saw that she had blood coming from her nose'," Mr McCoubrey quoted the defendant as saying.</p>
      <p>The prosecution claimed phone records showed the defendant had looked at pornography online multiple times after Ms Millane died and took seven intimate photographs of her body.</p>

      <p>The records also allegedly showed he had searched online for "the hottest fire", "large bags near me" and "Waitakere Ranges" - where her body was later found in the suitcase - before going on another Tinder date later that day.</p>
      <p>He then allegedly hired a professional carpet cleaning device.</p>
      <p>"If something had gone wrong, or someone fell unconscious and it was an accident, you'd expect someone to call for emergency assistance," Mr McCoubrey said.</p>
      <p>"But (the accused) had plainly gone to some lengths to break any forensic links between him and Ms Millane."</p>
      <p>Security footage showed the accused bought the suitcase and later used a trolley to take it from his apartment to a hire car.</p>

      <p>Ms Millane's remains were found inside the suitcase in a shallow grave off Scene Drive on December 9, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Footage from surveillance cameras in Auckland also captured Ms Millane up until she entered the defendant's apartment.</p>
      <p>"Only two people know what happened in that room, one of them can't tell us, the other one hasn't told the truth about what happened," Mr McCoubrey said.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Ian Brookie said Ms Millane "died as a result of what they consensually engaged in together".</p>
      <p>The death happened during "an act designed to enhance her sexual pleasure" and with Ms Millane's "knowledge and encouragement".</p>
      <p>The defendant wiped tears from his face as Mr Brookie added: "While his actions may have caused her death, he is not to blame.</p>
      <p>"This death was an accident."</p>
      <p>A pathologist told the jury of seven women and five men that the cause of death was "pressure to the neck".</p>
      <p>The trial continues and is expected to last five weeks.</p>
