      <p>ABOARD A FRENCH GOVERNMENT PLANE, Mali: French forces killed a top leader of a powerful African militant group linked to al-Qaeda in Mali last month, France's defence minister told AFP on Tuesday (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>Moroccan Ali Maychou of the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM) was "the second most-wanted terrorist in the Sahel, including by the Americans", Florence Parly said aboard a government plane as she returned from an official visit to the West African region.</p>

      <p>The GSIM has claimed responsibility for the biggest attacks in the Sahel since its official launch in 2017.</p>
      <p>Comprising several extremist groups linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the GSIM alliance is led by a Tuareg Malian, Iyad Ag Ghaly, a 29-year veteran.</p>
      <p>Ali Maychou was killed during the night of OctÂ 8 in Mali with the help of Malian troops and US support, Parly added.</p>
      <p>He had joined al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2012 before co-founding GSIM with Iyad Ag Ghaly and masterminding its expansion in the Sahel.</p>
      <p>The announcement came as Parly sought to reassure Mali of the support of European forces after a devastating militant attack last week that left dozens of soldiers dead.</p>
      <p>The nation's military is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency despite the help of forces from France, Africa and the United Nations, with a string of deadly assaults underscoring the fragility of a region where militant violence has claimed hundreds of lives.</p>
      <p>Before leaving Mali on Tuesday, Parly expressed confidence that France - which deployed its 4,500-strong Barkhane force in the Sahel in 2014 - was nearing a breakthrough in its efforts to convince European partners to boost military assistance.</p>
      <p>This would likely be in the form of training for the region's national armies.</p>
      <p>Ali Maychou is the second GSIM key figure killed this year after French commandos killed extremist veteran Djamel Okacha in February near Timbuktu.</p>
      <p>US officials had accused him of kidnapping a number of Westerners in North and West Africa.</p>
