UPS Drone Makes First Home Prescription Deliveries For CVS
06 Nov 2019, 07:30 by BeauHD
UPS subsidiary Flight Forward has completed the first prescription medication delivery to a customer's home by drone. Reuters reports: Flight Forward's maiden delivery flight on Friday in Cary, North Carolina, beat rivals in one phase of the race for the nascent market. The second drone flight delivered medications to a public space at a retirement community. The packages, roughly the size of small shoeboxes, were lowered from drones hovering at an altitude of about 20 feet. UPS and CVS said on Tuesday the deliveries were the first of their kind under an program approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Regulators are still hammering out rules for how the unmanned winged vehicles will operate in U.S. airspace and guidelines are expected in 2021.
