      <p>President Michael D Higgins opened the tributes on the night, hailing Mr Byrne as an icon who had the courage to “open up what should be opened up”.</p>
      <p>“I think that maybe the biggest thing was that people felt was that you had a kind of a safe, non-judgmental space where you could begin to think in a modern way,” President Higgins said of the Late Late Show during Mr Byrne’s tenure in the host’s seat.</p>
