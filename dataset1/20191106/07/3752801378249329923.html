      <p>A suspect who robbed students of cellphones and laptops at the University of Zululand in KwaZulu-Natal was killed in a shootout with police in the early hours of Tuesday morning. </p>
      <p>According to police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker, security guards saw two armed men entering a student accommodation at Nkonjane Reserve along the university boundary wall in KwaDlangezwa.</p>
      <p>"They immediately contacted the police and a rapid reaction team responded to the report of a house robbery. It is alleged that armed men entered a cottage and held up the occupants at gunpoint. The robbers demanded cellphones and laptops from the students.</p>
      <p>"When police officers arrived at the scene they could hear the students screaming for help inside the house," Naicker said. </p>
      <p>"As the suspects attempted to flee, they were confronted by police officers from the Mtunzini police station. There was an exchange of gunfire and one suspect was fatally wounded during the shootout."</p>
