      <p>The American band are known for absolutely titanic hit Apologize, originally released in 2006, but remixed by Timbaland to gain the band even more recognition in 2007 and send them to the top of singles charts around the world. The band headlined the Dubai Jazz Festival back in 2013, so they’re back for their first appearance in Dubai in seven years.</p>
