      <p>David Beckham wowed his kids Harper, Brooklyn and Cruz with a "fun night of fireworks".</p>
      <p>The happy dad, 44, ensured they had the best view from the rooftop of Television Centre in White City, London on Bonfire Night on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They cuddled up close for a sweet family photograph, offset by the bright fireworks going off in the background.</p>
      <p>Clearly having a great time, David shared a montage of videos from the rooftop with three of his children onto his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page.</p>
      <p>However, the former footballer admitted he was missing his absent son Romeo and his wife Victoria on the special occasion.</p>

      <p>It is not known where Victoria or Romeo were on Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>The famous family were straight back on the social scene in London after spending <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Victoria remained in the UK while David took the children to Los Angeles for half term.</p>
      <p>Harper had enjoyed a magical spell of trick-or-treating at newly weds Justin and Hailey Bieber's home, in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>David wrote of their trip on Instagram: "Thanks @justinbieber &amp; Haileybieber someone got her snow cone."</p>
