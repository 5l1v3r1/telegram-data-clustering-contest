Thai central bank cuts policy rate to support economy
06 Nov 2019, 07:23 by Reuters
BANGKOK (Nov 6): Thailand's central bank on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate for a second time this year to bolster flagging growth while inflation remains subdued.
The central bank said it would announce measures to encourage fund outflows to slow the baht's strength later on Wednesday.
The Bank of Thailand's (BOT) monetary policy committee voted 5-2 to cut the one-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, a record low last seen during the global financial crisis.
Two members favoured no policy change.
In a Reuters poll, a slim majority of economists — 15 out of 28 — predicted no policy change, while 13 others predicted a quarter-point cut.
In August, the committee unexpectedly cut the rate by a quarter point, the first easing since 2015, before pausing in September.
