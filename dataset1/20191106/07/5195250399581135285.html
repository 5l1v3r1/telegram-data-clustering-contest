      <h1>Toyota November 2019 Discounts – Innova Crysta, Fortuner, Corolla, Glanza, Etios</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T07:00:57+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/pranavsiddharth0303/" target="_blank">Team GaadiWaadi</a></address>
      <h3>Like several other car manufacturers, even Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) has been offering some great discounts on models like the Innova Crysta, Fortuner, Glanza and Etios</h3>
      <p>With the Diwali season over, most car manufacturers have lowered the discounts that they were offering on their product lineup. That said, the existing discounts still make it a pretty good option for the new car buyers to grab their favorite car right now and benefit from lowered prices.</p>
      <p>Like Hyundai Motor India Ltd and even Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, even Toyota Kirloskar Motor India has been offering some fantastic discounts across its lineup of models for India. Here is a look at the Toyota Cars discounts in November 2019.</p>
      <h4>1. Toyota Corolla Altis</h4>
      <p>Toyota Corolla Altis is a well-rounded D1-segment sedan that has been losing out to fresher rivals like the Hyundai Elantra facelift. However, the good part here is that it’s available with some fantastic discounts amounting to over Rs 1.5 lakh. Right now, this capable sedan is being sold with a cash discount of Rs 1,00,000 and a corporate offer of Rs 50,000. However, currently, there’s no exchange bonus available to the buyers of this model</p>
      <h4>2. Toyota Innova Crysta</h4>

      <p>The Innova Crysta, which is basically the second generation of the popular MPV, is being sold with benefits up to Rs 55,000. There’s a corporate discount of Rs 30,000, along with an exchange bonus of Rs 30,000. While not much, this discount is still pretty substantial if you take into account the fact that this highly popular MPV is seldom on sale with any sort of discounts.</p>
      <h4>3. Toyota Fortuner</h4>
      <p>The Toyota Fortuner has been undoubtedly the highest-selling SUV in its segment. Still, due to the lackluster sales, the top-selling product has been available with some good discounts. Right now, this full-size SUV is on sale with a corporate cash discount of Rs 40,000 and an exchange bonus of Rs 40,000. This takes the total discount to up to Rs 80,000, which is not bad at all for someone who is willing to invest his money into buying this premium SUV.</p>
