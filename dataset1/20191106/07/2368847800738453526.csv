香港科大生墜樓案疑點重重 目擊者詳述細節

06 Nov 2019, 07:31

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】22歲的科技大學二年級學生周梓樂，4日凌晨於將軍澳尚德停車場高處墮下，術後情況仍然危殆。警方5日晚在警察總部召開記者會，講述事件最新調查進展，否認傷者被警員推落樓。但港媒訪問多名目擊者，發現事件疑點重重。
11月5日晚，香港警方在警察總部召開記者會，東九龍總區高級警司（行動）傅逸婷說，科大學生墜樓案已交由東九龍總區重案組跟進。
警方稱，當時有大批示威者在停車場，警方發射44枚催淚彈、11發橡膠子彈、3枚布袋彈及1枚海綿彈，目的是驅散示威者。
但傅逸婷否認傷者被警員推落樓的說法，她聲稱，警員當時在看到急救員為其急救始得知事件。並指警方當日於凌晨1時完成驅散行動，拘捕兩名男子。
22歲科大男生周梓樂，10月4日凌晨於將軍澳示威活動期間，在尚德停車場墮樓頭部重創命危。5日，周梓樂疑出現腦死亡跡象。
4日晚，大批科大學生的身穿黑衣在校園集會「聲援受傷學生」，並請求校長史維以個人名義「譴責警暴」。但學生們的請求遭史維拒絕。
5日晚10點起，又有大批示威者聚集廣明苑，部分人戴上電影《V煞》面具，高喊「血債血償」等口號。約300名防暴警及速龍小隊到場戒備，其間放催淚彈清場。
截止目前，科大學生墜樓案仍在發酵中。

科大學生墜樓案疑點重重

《立場新聞》訪問多名目擊者，嘗試重組案情細節，發現事件疑點重重。
多名目擊者證實，事發後救護員約半小時方到場。有目擊者質疑救護車被警方阻撓未能駛進，延誤救援導致傷者情況更嚴峻。

目擊者：警察阻止救護

事發當日，警方與示威者於尚德邨外的唐明街、唐俊街交界對峙。約凌晨1時警方發射多枚催淚彈，十字路一帶煙霧彌漫。
將軍澳街坊Ricky是最先發現周梓樂倒臥的人之一，他說，當時正與另一中年男登上停車場2樓欲躲避催淚彈。凌晨1時許，一名黑衣少年呼叫「要FA（急救員）」，二人遂往察看，發現周倒地、面部朝地，地上有大量血。
3名沒有裝備的消防員其後途經現場，立即上前替周檢查。Ricky指當時周頭、手及腳無表面傷痕，但有抽搐及失禁症狀，消防認為傷勢極嚴重，立即經電台要求增援及召喚救護車。
7名帶備急救裝備的消防員及3名義務急救員約1時10分到場急救，搶救10分鐘後救護車仍未抵達。10多分鐘後，Ricky見到有一批約20至30人的防暴及速龍經過墮樓二樓位置，並舉槍指向Ricky及另一急救員，當時Ricky向警員呼叫：先救人，此時警員發現有消防在旁，才放下長槍離開。
Ricky之後聽到消防員與救護車對話，稱因十字路被警方封鎖，救護車未能駛入，有救護員稱，警察阻止入內。
Ricky形容，由消防員到場至救護員抵達之間相差近半小時。由於他在過程中不時拍照、拍片，所以可在相片紀錄中得知較為確實的時間。

急救員激動痛哭 Alan

事發當時，Alan 聽到有街坊呼叫需要急救員，他立即跑上停車場二樓，當時已經有消防員包圍著傷者。他上前協助，發現其昏迷指數（GCS）只得「311」，屬嚴重昏迷。
他們檢查過傷者，認為他沒有表面傷口，地面血跡相信是內傷嘔血。Alan 判斷傷勢嚴重，義務急救員及消防員難以提供太多協助，只能一直監測情況及提供氧氣等。
Alan到場後至少等待了15至20分鐘，期間傷者情況不斷惡化。另一名義務急救員走到地面，希望為救護員引路，但未成功，他說「下面block了，不讓十字車入」。
Alan憶述當時無助的感覺時，一度激動痛哭：「我們個個也很焦急…但我們完全做不到什麼…」

目擊者：居民麥先生

麥先生居住在廣明苑廣寧閣，家中向外望可以見到墮樓現場。事發時，他和女兒在家中用望遠鏡一直觀察著現場情況。他說救護員當日最少25分鐘後方到場。
消防處回覆傳媒查詢時稱，凌晨1點11分接報有人受傷，其間兩度有車輛阻塞救護車現場為傷者急救，1時41分將傷者送往伊利沙伯醫院。

周梓樂墮樓起因眾說紛紜

除了救護到場時間之外，周梓樂為何會從3樓墮至2樓？事發時3樓發生過什麼事？他是失足墮下，又或是有人將他推下？
其中一個主流說法稱，周是為躲避警方的催淚彈而墮下，也有稱，他是被警方追捕時墮樓。
有將軍澳廣明苑的居民在臉書上说，自己住的地方對面就是尚德停車場，4日晚停車場那個學生不是因為躲避催淚彈跌入樓，而是被黑警追著打，他後面有很大的煙，是他自己跌落還是被人跌落下去就沒看到，不過，肯定不是為躲避催淚彈而跌的，那裡的圍欄很高，一定是警察造成的。
另有網民說，如果周同學是被人打暈後再掉下去，一切疑問就簡單很多，人如果逃生會有反射動作來保護頭部，一層樓高度約兩至三米，如果有意識都會做保護動作，最多手腳骨折，斷不會是盆骨和頭部重創。從現在受傷情況來看，很有可能是被人扔下去時就已經暈了。
目擊者的說法及記者現場觀察同樣找不到證據顯示現場曾有催淚彈痕跡，警方發射催淚彈位置亦與墮樓位置相隔120米，而墮樓處石欄高達1.2米，要失足墮樓也不容易。
《立場新聞》記者5日到事發現場觀察，發現3樓墮樓位置旁邊，有通往後樓梯的防煙門。後方有馬路可以退回2樓。如果只是為了躲避催淚氣，跳往下層明顯不是最佳選項。
停車場通風良好，而非密封式設計，相信不會構成催淚煙未能消散的問題。
3樓石欄約高1.2米，對一般男子而言石欄高於腰部。失足跌下2樓的可能性並不大。石欄上累積了大量灰塵、雀屎，傷者衣物沒發現被抹到的明顯痕跡。
報導說，要還原事件最終真相，就要寄望現場的閉路電視及車cam畫面。但警方稱閉路電視沒有拍到傷者墮下的片段。
不過，有機會拍攝到事發經過的，還包括是停車場內的「車 cam」。5日將軍澳民生關注組葉嘉榮已經在停車場各車輛擋風玻璃上貼單張，呼籲車主提供車cam，但至今仍未有消息。

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology students have a lot of doubts about the fall of the building. Eyewitness details

06 Nov 2019, 07:31

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Zhou Xiaole, a 22-year-old second-year student of the University of Science and Technology, was squatting at the height of the Sundial parking lot in Tseung Kwan O on the morning of the 4th. The postoperative situation was still dangerous. The police held a press conference at the police headquarters on the evening of the 5th to tell the latest investigation of the incident and denied that the injured were pushed down by the police. However, the Hong Kong media visited a number of witnesses and found that the incident was very serious.
On the evening of November 5, the Hong Kong Police held a press conference at the Police Headquarters. The Senior Superintendent of the Kowloon East Region (Action) Fu Yiting said that the case of the College Student Falling House had been handed over to the District Crime Squad of Kowloon East.
Police said that there were a large number of demonstrators in the parking lot. The police fired 44 tear gas, 11 rubber bullets, 3 bag bombs and 1 sponge bomb to disperse the demonstrators.
However, Fu Yiting denied that the injured person had been pushed down by the police. She claimed that the police officers were aware of the incident when they saw the first responder for their first aid. It also stated that the police completed the dispersal operation at 1 am on the same day and arrested two men.
At the age of 22, on the morning of October 4, during the demonstrations in Tseung Kwan O, the head of the University of Science and Technology, the 22-year-old boy, was hit hard at the head of the Suntech parking lot. On the 5th, Zhou Yule suspected signs of brain death.
On the evening of the 4th, a large number of college students dressed in black gathered in the campus to ""support the injured students"" and asked the principal, Shi Wei, to ""condemn the police violence"" in his own name. However, the students’ requests were rejected by Shi Wei.
At 10 o'clock on the evening of the 5th, a large number of demonstrators gathered in Guangmingyuan. Some people wore masks of the movie ""V煞"" and shouted slogans such as ""blood debts."" About 300 riot police and Athlon squad were on the scene, and tear gas was released during the game.
Up to now, the college students' fall from the building is still in the process of fermentation.

College students fall into doubt

""Standing News"" visited a number of witnesses, tried to reorganize the details of the case, and found that the incident was very serious.
A number of witnesses confirmed that the ambulanceman was present for about half an hour after the incident. Witnesses questioned that the ambulance was blocked by the police and could not drive in. The delay in the rescue caused the injured to be more severe.

Witnesses: Police stop ambulance

On the day of the incident, the police confronted the demonstrators at the junction of Tang Ming Street and Tang Jun Street outside Suntech Village. At about 1 am, the police fired a number of tear gas, and the smog was filled with crossroads.
Ricky, the Tseung Kwan O neighbourhood, was one of the first to discover Zhou Yile's lying down. He said that he was on the second floor of the parking lot with another middle-aged man to avoid the tear gas. At 1 o'clock in the morning, a black boy called ""To FA (First Aid)"". The two men went to see it and found that the ground fell to the ground and there was a lot of blood on the ground.
Three unequipped firefighters passed through the scene and immediately went to the week for inspection. Ricky said that there were no surface scars on the hands and feet at the time, but there were symptoms of convulsions and incontinence. The fire believed that the injury was extremely serious and immediately requested reinforcements and summoned ambulances by radio.
Seven firefighters with emergency equipment and three first-aid first aid officers arrived at the scene at approximately 1:10, and the ambulance remained unfinished after 10 minutes of rescue. After more than 10 minutes, Ricky saw a group of about 20 to 30 people with riot and Athlon passing the second floor of the tower and pointing a gun at Ricky and another first aid. At that time, Ricky called the policeman: first save people, now Police officers found that there was a fire beside them before they let go of the long gun.
Ricky later heard a conversation between the firefighter and the ambulance, saying that the ambulance was unable to enter because of the crossroads being blocked by the police. Some ambulancemen said that the police blocked the entry.
Ricky described the difference between the arrival of firefighters and the arrival of ambulancemen for nearly half an hour. Since he photographed and filmed from time to time in the process, he can get a more accurate time in the photo record.

First aid officer is crying and crying Alan

At the time of the incident, Alan heard that there was a need for first-aiders to call the neighborhood. He immediately ran to the second floor of the parking lot, where firefighters surrounded the wounded. He stepped forward and found that his coma index (GCS) had only ""311"", which was a serious coma.
They examined the injured and thought that he had no surface wounds. The blood on the ground was believed to be internal hemorrhage. Alan judged that the injury was serious. It was difficult for the first aid and firefighters to provide too much assistance. They could only monitor the situation and provide oxygen.
Alan waited at least 15 to 20 minutes after arriving, and the situation of the injured continued to deteriorate. Another first-aid first-aid rescuer walked to the ground and hoped to lead the way for the ambulanceman, but he was unsuccessful. He said, ""The block below is not allowed to enter the cross.""
When Alan recalled the feeling of helplessness at the time, she was so excited and crying: ""We are all anxious... but we can't do anything...""

Witness: Mr. Mai, resident

Mr. Mai lives in Guangning Pavilion, Guangmingyuan, and can see the scene of the tower. At the time of the incident, he and his daughter used the telescope at home to observe the scene. He said that the ambulanceman was present at least 25 minutes later.
In response to media enquiries, the Fire Services Department said that it was reported that there was an injury at 1:11 am. There were two vehicles blocking the ambulance at the scene for the first-aid injury. The injured were taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital at 1:41.

Zhou Yile’s building starts to say different opinions.

In addition to the time of the ambulance, why did Zhou Yule go from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor? What happened on the 3rd floor at the time of the incident? Is he missing, or is someone pushing him down?
One of the mainstream claims is that Zhou was squatting to avoid the tear gas of the police. He also said that he was arrested by the police.
The residents of Guangmingyuan, Tseung Kwan O, said on Facebook that the place where they lived was the Suntech parking lot. On the evening of the 4th, the student was not chased by tears and fell into the building. Instead, he was chased by the black police. The smoke, whether he fell or was dropped, he did not see it. However, it certainly did not fall away from the tear gas. The fence there was high and must have been caused by the police.
Another netizen said that if Zhou’s classmates are stunned and then fall down, all the questions are much simpler. If people escape, there will be reflections to protect the head. The height of one floor is about two to three meters. If you are conscious, you will do it. Protection action, most hands and feet fracture, broken will not be pelvic and head heavy. Judging from the current injury situation, it is very likely that it has already been dizzy when thrown away.
Witnesses’ opinions and reporters’ observations on the spot also showed no evidence that there were traces of tear gas on the scene. The position of the police launching tear gas was 120 meters away from the location of the tower, and the stone fence at the tower was 1.2 meters. It is not easy to lose the floor. .
On the 5th, the reporter of ""Standing News"" observed the scene and found that there was a smoke door leading to the back stairs next to the 3rd floor. There is a road at the rear that can be returned to the 2nd floor. If you just want to avoid tears, jumping to the lower level is obviously not the best option.
The parking lot is well ventilated, not a sealed design, and it is believed that it will not constitute a problem that tears fail to dissipate.
The stone fence on the 3rd floor is about 1.2 meters high. For the average man, the stone fence is higher than the waist. It is unlikely that the fall will fall off the second floor. A large amount of dust and gar was accumulated on the stone fence, and the wounded clothing did not find any obvious marks that were wiped.
The report said that in order to restore the event, the final truth, we must look at the scene of CCTV and car cam screen. However, the police said that CCTV did not capture the footage of the injured.
However, there is a chance to photograph the incident, including the ""car cam"" in the parking lot. On the 5th, the Tseung Kwan O People's Livelihood Concern Group Ye Jiarong has posted a leaflet on the windshield of each parking lot in the parking lot, calling on the owner to provide the car cam, but there is still no news so far.
