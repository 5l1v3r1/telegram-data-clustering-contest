      <p>Self-exiled Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has said he will return to the country on Saturday to face arrest after a mass crackdown at home on opposition activists and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/malaysia-detains-cambodian-dissidents-headed-thailand-191106010653906.html">detention</a> of members of his banned party by Malaysian authorities.</p>
      <p>The government of Prime Minister Hun Sen has accused members of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) of plotting a coup and said they will be arrested if they try to enter the country. </p>

      <p>"I will depart from Paris on Thursday November 7. I will arrive in Bangkok on Friday November 8 to be ready to enter Cambodia on Saturday November 9," Sam Rainsy, the CNRP's founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/RainsySam/status/1191941119485059073">tweeted</a> on Wednesday along with a photo of his aeroplane ticket.</p>
      <p>November 9 is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cambodia.html">Cambodia</a>'s Independence Day, celebrating freedom from French colonial rule.</p>

      <p>Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Wednesday that Rainsy would not be allowed to enter Thailand. </p>
      <p>Referring to Thailand's ties with Cambodia as a fellow member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping, Prayut said: "According to our commitment to ASEAN, we will not interfere in each other’s internal affairs, and we will not allow an anti-government person to use Thailand for activism.</p>
      <p>He added: "I have ordered this, so he probably won't get in."</p>
      <p>The country recently turned away Mu Sochua, the CNRP's vice president, when she flew into Bangkok's main international airport.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/questions-rainsy-cambodia-return-deputy-turned-191024022403262.html">Sochua</a> announced at a press conference in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, that she and her colleagues would also be attempting to return to Cambodia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We are risking our lives. We will go to Cambodia empty-handed with bare hands," said Sochua, who added the return of self-exiled CNRP members was "not a coup d'etat", as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/cambodia-steps-opposition-crackdown-rainsy-return-nears-191014041316183.html">labelled</a> by the government.</p>
      <p>Cambodia's ambassador to Indonesia, Hor Nambora, tried to block Sochua's news conference calling it an "illegal" event, a live broadcast of the event showed. Shortly afterwards, the Cambodian embassy in Jakarta issued a statement urging authorities in Indonesia to arrest and deport the "fugitive" Sochua. </p>

      <p>A 2017 court ruling dissolved the CNRP on grounds of plotting to overthrow the government, leading to a five-year ban for more than 100 party members.</p>
      <p>Sam Rainsy fled to France four years ago, following a conviction for criminal defamation, in which he was ordered to pay $1m in compensation. He also faces a five-year prison sentence in a separate case.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen's government deployed troops along its borders in response to Rainsy's announcement of his planned return.</p>
      <p>Sam Rainsy told The Associated Press news agency he hopes his planned return will trigger a People's Power-style movement to force Hun Sen from office.</p>
      <p>He has previously said it was legitimate to seek to topple Hun Sen because the prime minister has created a one-party state and was not prepared to hold free and fair elections.</p>
