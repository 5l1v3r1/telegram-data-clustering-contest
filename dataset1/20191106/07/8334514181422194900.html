      <p>BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday urged the re-elected Canadian government to immediately release detained Huawei [HWT.UL] executive Meng Wanzhou.</p>
      <p>Geng Shuang, a spokesman at the ministry, made the comment at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>Meng has been detained in Vancouver since December last year. She is charged in the United States with bank fraud, and is accused of misleading HSBC Holdings PLC (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/HSBA.L">HSBA.L</a>) about Huawei Technologies’ business in Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions.</p>
      <p>Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition to the United States.</p>
      <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal Party held on to power after an election in October, though it was reduced to a minority government that needs the support in Parliament of a smaller left-leaning party.</p>
