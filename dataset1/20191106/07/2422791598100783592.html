      <h1>Cyclist who flipped off Trump motorcade wins local office in Virginia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T07:15:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author">AFP, Staff</a></address>
      <p>A cyclist who was fired after flipping the bird -- making a rude single-fingered gesture -- to U.S. President Donald Trump's motorcade has been elected to local office in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Juli Briskman, whose one-handed salute was captured in an AFP photograph that went viral, beat the Republican incumbent to a seat on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in state elections that saw Trump's Republican party suffer a series of stinging defeats.</p>
      <p>The single mother of two teens lost her job as a marketing analyst for a United States government and military subcontractor after the snapshot of her gesture spread across media and the internet in 2017, bringing her insults and threats.</p>
      <p>But getting fired also opened "a lot of doors", the 52-year-old told AFP during her campaign, including accepting an invitation to run for local office on the Democratic ticket.</p>
      <p>That decision paid off on Tuesday night, as Briskman celebrated her victory in a tweet that linked to a copy of the image.</p>
      <p>"Looking forward to representing my friends &amp; neighbors in #Algonkian District who backed me up today! So proud that we were able to #FlipLoudpun," <a href="https://twitter.com/julibriskman/status/1191926528889765888?s=20">she wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>With 52 per cent of the vote after 99 per cent of precincts had reported, the result saw Republican Suzanne Volpe beaten into second place.</p>
      <p>When fighting her campaign in Loudoun County -- the wealthiest in the U.S. -- Briskman didn't bring up the image that sparked her 15 minutes of fame unless homeowners started "talking about the administration" or commented on her bicycle pin.</p>
      <p>Instead, the ultramarathon runner told AFP she wanted to show that there was "substance" behind her candidacy -- education, women's rights, transportation and environmental issues -- and that she wasn't "just the person that rode my bike one day and flipped off the president."</p>
      <p>Her success comes as Trump's party also lost control of both chambers of the legislature in increasingly blue Virginia, U.S. media including The New York Times projected.</p>
      <p>Democrats will now hold all major statewide offices and rule the state assembly, a comprehensive consolidation of power not seen in the state since the 1990s.</p>
