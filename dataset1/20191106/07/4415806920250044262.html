      <p>Smoking tobacco may increase the risk of developing depression and schizophrenia, according to a new study.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the University of Bristol analysed data from 462,690 people of European ancestry.</p>
      <p>They found evidence that tobacco smoking increased the risk of depression and schizophrenia, while results also showed people with those conditions are more likely to start smoking.</p>
      <p>The study is published in the journal Psychological Medicine on Wednesday, the same day as a report from Action on Smoking and Health (ASH).</p>
      <p>That report calls for more to be done to help smokers with mental health conditions to stop.</p>
      <p>Smoking killed 78,000 people in England last year and is the largest single contributor to the average 10-20 year reduction in life expectancy among people with mental health conditions, ASH states.</p>
      <p>Dr Robyn Wootton, senior research associate in Bristol University’s School of Experimental Psychology, said: “Individuals with mental illness are often overlooked in our efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, leading to health inequalities.</p>
      <p>“Our work shows that we should be making every effort to prevent smoking initiation and encourage smoking cessation because of the consequences to mental health as well as physical health.”</p>
      <blockquote>While we have seen smoking rates fall dramatically for the population as a whole over the last four decades, we haven’t seen the same decline for people with mental health conditions</blockquote>
      <p>Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) said smoking rates among people with serious mental health conditions are more than 50% higher than in the general population.</p>
      <p>Previous studies looking at this association have been unable to ascertain whether it is a cause-and-effect relationship – and if which direction if so.</p>
      <p>The ASH report, funded by Public Health England, found that 82% of surveyed mental health trusts have a comprehensive smokefree policy in place – the Government’s target is 100%.</p>
      <p>Of the trusts that responded to the report, all offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) but only 47% offered the most effective smoking treatment of either combination or varenicline.</p>
      <p>In 55% of the trusts, patients were not always asked their smoking status on admission.</p>
      <p>Staff accompanied patients on smoking breaks every day in 57% of the trusts despite NICE recommending no staff-supervised or staff-facilitated smoking breaks.</p>
      <p>Ann McNeill, Professor of Tobacco Addiction and co-chair of the Mental Health and Smoking Partnership said: “Helping people with mental health conditions to quit smoking is the best way to help them live longer.</p>
      <p>“While we have seen smoking rates fall dramatically for the population as a whole over the last four decades, we haven’t seen the same decline for people with mental health conditions.”</p>
      <p>The University of Bristol team used UK Biobank data from 462,690 people of European ancestry, comprising of 8% current smokers and 22% former smokers.</p>
      <p>They used an analytic approach called Mendelian randomisation, which uses genetic variants associated with an exposure, such as to smoking, to support conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the researchers published a study in the British Journal of Psychiatry showing evidence that tobacco smoking increases the risk of bipolar disorder.</p>
