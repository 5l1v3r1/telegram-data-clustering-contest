　６日午後３時頃、兵庫県尼崎市東七松町の同市役所南館１階西側入り口で、男が灯油のような液体を床にまき、火をつけた新聞紙を投げた。床から炎が上がったが、近くにいた職員が消火器で消し止め、けが人はなかった。男は自転車で逃走し、約１時間２０分後、約１・５キロ離れた場所で県警尼崎南署員が見つけ、現住建造物等放火未遂容疑で緊急逮捕した。黙秘しているという。
　発表では、男は住所職業不詳、森茂容疑者（５１）。事件直前、南館２階で、ポリタンクを持ってソファに座っているところを職員が見つけ、注意したところ、庁舎外に出たが、戻ってきて液体をまいたという。
　森容疑者は昨年７月、市役所でハンマーを持って暴れ、暴力行為等処罰法違反容疑で現行犯逮捕されていた。当時も灯油の入ったポリタンクを持ち込んでいたという。同署は逆恨みの可能性があるとみて調べる。
　当時、庁舎内には多くの職員や市民がおり、騒然となった。消火作業に当たった臨時職員の男性（６７）は「炎が高さ１メートルまで上がった。京都アニメーションの放火事件もあったので怖かったが、燃え広がらなくてよかった」と話していた。

At around 3:00 pm on the 6th, at the west entrance of the 1st floor of the city hall South Building in Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture, a man sprinkled a liquid like kerosene on the floor and threw a fired newspaper. A flame went up from the floor, but a nearby employee was extinguished with a fire extinguisher, and no one was injured. The man ran away by bicycle, and after about 1 hour and 20 minutes, a police officer from Minami Prefectural Police Amagasaki was found about 1.5 kilometers away, and was arrested on suspicion of attempting to arson of the current building. He says he is silent.
According to the announcement, the man is unknown to the occupation of the address, Susumu Mori (51). Just before the incident, on the 2nd floor of the South Building, the staff found a plastic tank sitting on the couch, and when they were careful, they went out of the government building but returned and sprinkled liquid.
In July last year, Suspect Mori was rampant with a hammer at the city hall, and was arrested for violating violence and other punishment laws. At that time, he was brought in a plastic tank containing kerosene. The station looks at the possibility of a reversal.
At that time, there were many employees and citizens in the government building, and it became noisy. A man (67) of a temporary worker who worked on the fire extinguisher said, “The flame rose to a height of 1 meter. I was scared because there was an arson case of Kyoto animation, but I did n’t want to spread.”
