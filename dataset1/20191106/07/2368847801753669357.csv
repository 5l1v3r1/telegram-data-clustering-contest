韓正挺林鄭港警「再前進」 言論比習還狠

06 Nov 2019, 07:49

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】香港特首林鄭月娥獲習近平「高度信任」後，今天（11月6日）又首次在北京與中共副總理韓正公開會面。主管港澳事務的韓正力挺林鄭和港警「往前進」，言論比習近平還狠。外界猜測，韓正或藉此機會向林鄭下達四中全會的所有指令，利用她為當局幹完所有髒活。
韓正身兼港澳工作協調小組組長，6日早上，他在北京釣魚台國賓館接見林鄭。韓正表示，習近平在上海親自會見林鄭並肯定她和特區政府工作，希望她牢記囑託，帶領香港管治團隊再出發再前進。
據中共官媒報導，參與會見的還包括國務院常務副秘書長丁學東、港澳辦主任張曉明、中聯辦主任王志民、政制及內地事務局局長聶德權、特首辦主任陳國基等人。
韓正對林鄭表示，這場反送中抗爭運動使香港出現了97年以來最嚴峻的局面，中央對此「不能容忍和接受」，「止暴制亂、恢復秩序」是當前最重要工作，同時也是香港行政、立法、司法機關共同責任和最大共識。
同時，他還強調，中央一如既往支持特區政府和警隊。外界注意到，韓正對香港抗爭運動的言論比習近平還狠，他力挺港府和香港警隊，明確釋放將對香港民主抗議活動進一步暴力鎮壓的信號。
有分析指，韓正首次公開和林鄭會面，有試圖鞏固林鄭在香港的地位，利用她繼續為中共當局幹髒活。猜測韓正可能會藉此機會向林鄭下達四中全會通過的所有指令。
獨立評論人協會召集人、浸大新聞系高級講師呂秉權日前曾對港媒分析稱，中共暫時不讓林鄭下台，是因為還需要她「用盡剩餘日子，做dirty job（幹髒活兒）」。
韓正是公開力挺林鄭修訂「送中惡法」的中共政治局常委，7月初之前，韓正曾二度坐鎮深圳，近距離觀察香港事態。每次韓正南下之後，香港的矛盾都呈現激化狀態。
香港被指是中南海權斗的前哨之地，現今分管港澳事務的韓正、張曉明、王志民的背景都屬於江派人馬。資深政論人士林保華對台媒分析說，香港處在中共權斗的磨心，各派都希望對方犯錯而撈取好處。
在此之前，林鄭4日在上海向習近平匯報香港情況時，中共公安部部長趙克志陪同出席。有消息指趙克志正式加入成為港澳工作協調小組第5名副組長，顯示公安系統在涉港澳事務上將扮演更重要的角色。
此外，剛剛結束的中共四中全會，當局提出要依照憲法基本法對港澳「實行管治」，「建立健全特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制」。這顯示，中央未來對香港的全面管控會變得更嚴。
四中全會之後，港警鎮壓手段明顯升級。11月2日，港人發起「求援國際、堅守自治」集會，集會剛剛開始遭到警方暴力阻擾、驅散，當天共抓捕超過200人，其中包括3名區議員候選人，創下日抓捕人數新記錄。
事實上，早在8月，香港《蘋果日報》披露，有大陸消息人士稱，習近平在北戴河會議期間，下令對香港無需動用部隊，實施「嚴刑峻法」，盡快平亂。北京命令已由中聯辦控制的香港警隊，要「多抓人」並加重判刑。
香港中文大學中國研究中心客座教授林和立則表示，北京的立場和香港示威者的訴求是背道而馳的，今後一段時間內，香港的抗爭可能會進一步升級。

Han Zhengting, Lin Zhenggang, ""Going Forward""

06 Nov 2019, 07:49

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] After the Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue received Xi Jinping's ""high trust"", today (November 6), he met with the Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng for the first time in Beijing. Han Zhengli, who is in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, is quite a leader of Lin Zheng and the Hong Kong Police. The remarks are even worse than Xi Jinping. It is speculated that Han Zheng will take this opportunity to give Lin Zheng all the instructions of the Fourth Plenary Session and use her to do all the dirty work for the authorities.
Han Zhengshen and the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Coordination Group, on the morning of the 6th, he met Lin Zheng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. Han Zheng said that Xi Jinping personally met with Lin Zheng in Shanghai and affirmed her work with the SAR government. She hoped that she would keep in mind and lead the Hong Kong governance team to move forward.
According to the official media reports of the Chinese Communist Party, the executive vice-president of the State Council, Ding Xuedong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Zhang Xiaoming, Director of the Liaison Office, Wang Zhimin, Secretary of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Nie Dequan, and Director of the Chief Executive Office, Chen Guoji, and others.
Han Zheng said to Lin Zheng that this anti-delivery campaign has made Hong Kong the most serious situation in 1997. The central government has ""not tolerated and accept"", ""stopping the storm and restoring order"" is the most important task at present. It is also the common responsibility and the greatest consensus of Hong Kong's administrative, legislative and judicial organs.
At the same time, he also stressed that the central government will continue to support the SAR government and the police. The outside world has noticed that Han Zheng’s remarks on the Hong Kong protest movement are more rampant than Xi Jinping. He is convinced that the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Police Force will clearly release the signal that will further suppress the democratic protests in Hong Kong.
Some analysts pointed out that Han Zheng had publicly met with Lin Zheng for the first time. He tried to consolidate Lin Zheng’s position in Hong Kong and used her to continue to work for the Chinese Communist Party. Guess that Han Zheng may take this opportunity to give Lin Zheng all the instructions passed by the Fourth Plenary Session.
Lv Bingquan, a convener of the Independent Critics Association and a senior lecturer at the Department of Information, has analyzed the Hong Kong media. "".""
Han is the member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, who publicly supported Lin Zheng’s revision of the ""Send the Evil Law."" Before the beginning of July, Han Zheng had twice sat in Shenzhen to observe the situation in Hong Kong. After every time South Korea went south, the contradictions in Hong Kong were intensified.
Hong Kong is accused of being the outpost of Zhongnanhai Power Fighting. The background of Han Zheng, Zhang Xiaoming and Wang Zhimin, who are now in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, belong to the Jiang faction. Senior political commentator Lin Baohua said to Taiwan media that Hong Kong is in the guise of the CCP’s power struggle, and all factions hope that the other party will make mistakes and gain benefits.
Prior to this, when Lin Zheng reported on Hong Kong to Xi Jinping in Shanghai on the 4th, Zhao Kezhi, Minister of the Ministry of Public Security of the Communist Party of China, accompanied him. It is reported that Zhao Kezhi officially joined the fifth deputy head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Coordination Group, indicating that the public security system will play a more important role in Hong Kong and Macao affairs.
In addition, at the just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the authorities proposed to ""administer governance"" to Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the Basic Law of the Constitution and ""establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for special administrative regions to safeguard national security."" This shows that the central government's overall control over Hong Kong will become stricter.
After the Fourth Plenary Session, the Hong Kong police crackdown measures were significantly upgraded. On November 2nd, the Hong Kong people launched a rally called ""Helping the International and Adhering to Autonomy."" The rally was just beginning to be harassed and dispelled by the police. On the same day, more than 200 people were arrested, including three candidates for district board members. A new record of the number of people.
In fact, as early as August, Hong Kong's ""Apple Daily"" disclosed that some mainland sources said that during the Beidaihe meeting, Xi Jinping ordered that Hong Kong not need to use troops to implement ""severe punishment and serious law"" and be as chaotic as possible. The Hong Kong Police Force, which has been ordered by the China Central Liaison Office, has to ""catch more people"" and aggravate the sentence.
Lin Heli, a visiting professor at the Chinese Studies Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that Beijing’s position is contrary to the demands of Hong Kong demonstrators. In the future, Hong Kong’s resistance may escalate further.
