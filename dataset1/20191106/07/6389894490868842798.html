      <h1>Marks &amp; Spencer's profit falls on poor clothing and home sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T07:12:43+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 07:12</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Weak clothing and home sales sank profits at Marks &amp; Spencer in its latest half-year as the retailer said it was now “making up for lost time” by turning around the struggling divisions.</p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p><b>Revenue fell</b> 2.1 per cent year on year to <b>£4.86bn</b> in the six months to the end of September.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile <b>profit before tax declined </b>17.1 per cent to <b>£176.5m</b> owing to poor first half clothing and homeware sales.</p>
      <p><b>Basic earnings per share rocketed</b> 74.3 per cent to year on year to <b>6.1p</b> and the retailer also <b>cut net debt</b> 3.7 per cent to leave it at <b>£4.13bn</b>.</p>
      <p>However, M&amp;S’s <b>interim dividend plunged</b> 40 per cent to <b>3.9p</b>, down from last year’s 6.5p.</p>
      <h3>What Marks &amp; Spencer said</h3>
      <p>Chief executive Steve Rowe said:</p>
      <blockquote>Our transformation plan is now running at a pace and scale not seen before at Marks &amp; Spencer. For the first time we are beginning to see the potential from the far reaching changes we are making. The Food business is outperforming the market. Our deal to create a joint venture with Ocado is complete and plans to transition to the M&amp;S range are on track.<br/><br/>In Clothing &amp; Home we are making up for lost time. We are still in the early stages, but we are clear on the issues we need to fix and, after a challenging first half, we are seeing a positive response to this season’s contemporary styling and better value product. We have taken decisive action to trade the ranges with improved availability and shorter clearance periods. In some instances dramatic sales uplifts in categories where we have restored value, style and availability illustrate the latent potential and enduring broad appeal of our brand. Our cost reduction and store technology programmes are on track.</blockquote>
