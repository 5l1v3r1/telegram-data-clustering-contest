      <h2>SpiceJet Ltd., which has as many as 205 737 Max jets on order, has said it may buy at least 100 Airbus planes worth more than $10 billion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:11:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anurag Kotoky | Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>India will be the world’s fastest-growing aviation market over the next two decades, according to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>Co., which expects the South Asian nation to need 2,380 planes in that period at a value of $330 billion.</p>
      <p>The U.S. manufacturer’s forecast is slightly higher than the one it made in December 2018, when it said India would require 2,300 new aircraft for $320 billion over 20 years. At a briefing in New Delhi on Wednesday, Boeing’s deputy vice president of commercial marketing Darren Hulst said first deliveries of the 777X are planned in the next 18 months.</p>
      <p>Hulst also said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>is working closely with regulators to get the 737 Max back into operation in the U.S. this quarter and then elsewhere depending on regulatory approvals. The previously best-selling jet has been grounded globally since mid-March following deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/spicejet">SpiceJet </a>Ltd., which has as many as 205 737 Max jets on order, has said it may buy at least 100 Airbus planes worth more than $10 billion as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>grapples with the fallout from its grounded plane. Boeing also lost a $25 billion, 210-aircraft order from Jet Airways India Ltd. earlier this year after the carrier stopped flying. Compounding matters, rival Airbus just announced a blockbuster order from Indian market leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo.</a></p>
      <p>The failure of Jet Airways dented air traffic growth in India as it took more than 100 aircraft out of action almost overnight, while a slowing economy has also pegged numbers back. Still, air-travel penetration remains low in the nation of 1.3 billion, encouraging airlines to expand rapidly even as provincial taxes push up the cost of jet fuel.</p>
