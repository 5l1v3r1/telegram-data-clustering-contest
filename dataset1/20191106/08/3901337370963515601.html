      <p>After missing last night’s match against Maritzburg United, reigning PSL’s Footballer of the Season Thembinkosi Lorch is set to return for Saturday’s clash against Chiefs, with the two teams set to battle it out for maximum points, one week after facing off in the Telkom Knockout. </p>
      <p>While he didn’t score against Amakhosi, Lorch was seen by many as a hero for Bucs, after he provided assists for both goals before succumbing to defeat in a penalty shootout.</p>

      <p>The defender will hope to be back in the side for their match against Polokwane City on November 26.     </p>
