      <p>Cape Town - <b>Pitso Mosimane</b> has expressed his sadness that <b>Benni McCarthy</b> has lost his job as head coach of <b>Cape Town City</b>.</p>
      <p>McCarthy was given the boot on Monday with the Citizens having made a poor start to the season with only one victory in nine league matches.</p>
      <p>Mosimane reveals that he admired McCarthy's team played during his two-and-half-years in charge of the Cape club.</p>
      <p><b><i>"I am very, very saddened by the Benni McCarthy sacking. </i></b><b><i>I was his biggest fan, admiring how he taught his team to play the right way of playing football. His team could build-up play from the back like what big teams do in Europe (Man City, Bayern, Liverpool etc)," </i></b>Mosimane said on his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>The Mamelodi Sundowns mentor went on to say that he hoped McCarthy is not lost to South African football.</p>
      <p><b><i>"A typical example of his work was the goal that Cape Town City scored against Kaizer Chiefs. A coaching clip for coaches and those who believe in good football. A big loss to SA football and I hope he remains in the PSL to transfer his philosophy to another team," </i></b>Mosimane continued.</p>
      <p>The former Bafana Bafana coach believes that players around the country and Africa went on to play for City because of McCarthy's status in world football.</p>
      <p><b><i>"Some players went to play for Cape Town City just to play for him. A very good coach and I salute you Benni. You can walk away with pride especially after delivering a trophy in just a year an half," </i></b>he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, according to reports, <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/muhsin-drops-instagram-hint-hes-back-in-cape-town-20191105">Muhsin Ertugral is expected to have a strong chance of becoming the new City coach</a> whereas <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/boardroom-fights-clashing-egos-how-things-unravelled-for-benni-mccarthy-at-ct-city-20191104">McCarthy is touted to head north to Johannesburg for talks with Orlando Pirates</a>.</p>
