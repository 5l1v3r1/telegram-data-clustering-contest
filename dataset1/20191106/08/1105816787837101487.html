      <p>Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker is facing severe backlash on social media for abusing a four-year-old child actor as she recalled an incident on the chat show <i>Son Of Abish</i>.</p>
      <p>A video spreading like wildfire on social media shows Swara using the swear words for a child actor with whom she worked with in an advertisement shoot during her early days in the film industry.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Swara got angry because the child had addressed her as aunty.</p>

      <p>According to Swara, children were basically “evil” and this kid was only a brat, throwing tantrums.</p>
      <p>Twitterati started slamming the actor as soon as the video went viral, and the hashtag #SwaraAunty has been trending on the micro-blogging website since Tuesday morning.</p>
