      <h1>Germany could ban Huawei from 5G build-out, says defence minister</h1>

      <p>Germany could still decide to rule out Chinese telecom equipment vendor Huawei Technologies from the construction of the country's fifth-generation data network (5G) due to security concerns, the defence minister has said.</p>
      <p>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told a cyber security conference on Tuesday that it was important to minimise any risks.</p>
      <p>The German government is currently trying to shape the 5G security criteria in a way that would prevent foreign governments from gaining access to Germany's important infrastructure, said Kramp-Karrenbauer.</p>
      <p>"If that's not possible, then one has to ban Huawei from the procedure - just like other countries have done," said the minister, who is a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
      <p>The comments are the strongest sign yet that Berlin is willing to take a tougher approach on Huawei, and may exclude the Chinese equipment vendor at least from some parts of the 5G network.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also cast doubt on whether Huawei could participate in the construction of the country's 5G network.</p>
      <p>Government officials confirmed last month that Germany's so-called security catalogue foresaw an evaluation of technical and other criteria, but said no single vendor would be barred in order to create a level playing field for equipment vendors.</p>
      <p>The United States has piled pressure on its allies to shut out Huawei, the leading telecoms equipment vendor with a global market share of 28%, saying its equipment contained 'back doors' that would enable China to spy on other countries.</p>
