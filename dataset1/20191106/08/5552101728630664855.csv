為余天抱不平　綠中常委哽咽要求黨紀處分李余典
06 Nov 2019, 08:35 by 黃揚明, 鄒保祥, 楊子磊
民進黨今（6日）開中常會，邀請新北市黨部執行長李建興報告新北市立委選情。李建興提及身兼新北市黨部主委的第3選區（三重）立委余天因同黨市議員李余典女兒李旻蔚代表台灣民眾黨參選，目前選情膠著。與余天同屬正國會系統的中常委陳茂松當場要求黨中央應對李余典祭黨紀，講到激動處還一度哽咽。
據轉述，李建興報告時提及，余天不但自己要選立委，因身兼新北市黨部主委，還要全力輔選黨內其他參選人，加上他又身兼總統蔡英文新北競總主委，明天起就會把新北市黨部所有人力全部進駐新北競辦，但余天的三重選區卻遭遇同黨議員的女兒脫黨參選挑戰，導致選情緊繃，余也非常緊張。


民進黨主席卓榮泰今出席中常會。

陳茂松接著表示，新北市黨部開會討論李余典、李旻蔚的黨紀問題，余天還對執委、評委說，大家都是同志，應以和為貴，希望不要處理。因此陳呼籲黨中央應該要主動處理脫黨參選者的黨紀問題，且全力相挺余天。
民進黨主席卓榮泰表態一定會力挺余天，至於黨紀問題也會在登記參選後儘速處理。李建興補充，上月25日新北市黨部已決議開除李旻蔚黨籍，並送中央黨部中評會處理，李余典違紀助選部分則要再討論。
除了余天選區，李建興報告時提及，目前新北膠著的區域還包括第1選區（淡水等區）的立委呂孫綾以及第12選區（汐止等區）的賴品妤。他說，呂孫綾需要黨中央大力相挺，賴品妤條件好外型佳，加上在該選區綠營有穩固基礎，又遇上空降的對手李永萍，應該沒有輸的理由。
至於選情領先選區，則包括新北市第2選區（蘆洲、五股等區）的林淑芬、第4選區（新莊區）的吳秉叡、第5選區（樹林、鶯歌）的蘇巧慧、第6選區（板橋西區）的張宏陸、第7選區（板橋東區）的羅致政、第8選區（中和）的江永昌以及第10選區（土城、三峽）的吳琪銘，都是現任立委。
仍待努力的選區則是新北市第9選區（永和區）的參選人蔡沐霖以及第11選區（新店等區）的參選人張銘祐。
