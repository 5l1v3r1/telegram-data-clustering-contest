      <h1>Guide Dogs Christmas advert will break hearts as puppy Henry's dream comes true</h1>
      <h2>The 2019 Guide Dogs Christmas advert will premier tonight, and it tells the story of a very excited little puppy from the North Pole</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:45:35+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Christmas adverts are designed to pull on our heartstrings and get us into the festive spirit, while starting us thinking about spending all our well-earned pennies.</p>
      <p>But one of the early contenders for the ad of the season comes from Guide Dogs, released today to promote its Sponsor a Puppy Christmas campaign.</p>
      <p>The animated clip tells the story of excited puppy Henry who lives with Father Christmas in the North Pole.</p>
      <p>It starts on the night before Christmas, with a very sad looking Henry watching the reindeer and his sleigh heading out to deliver presents.</p>
      <p>He dreams of guiding the sleigh but the other reindeer laugh at him and Father Christmas says "not this time".</p>

      <p>We then skip forward to the following year, when Henry is allowed to get into the sleigh and fly over the city.</p>
      <p>Little Henry is dropped off at Guide Dog Puppy School, where the narrator explains that Father Christmas's plan is for him to guide a person, not a sleigh.</p>
      <p>We then see him getting his training and he is inspired by watching live action footage of Toffee, a qualified guide dog, enjoying the festive season with his owner Stacey.</p>

      <p>At the end of the advert, we watch as little Henry transforms into a real puppy as he embarks on his journey to becoming a life-changing guide dog.</p>
      <p>Henry is played by Xander, a Labrador cross golden retriever, who is cared for by Guide Dogs volunteer Margaret Tasker, from Rugby, Warwickshire.</p>
      <p>Margaret says: “Xander has settled in well, he is very loving and clever.</p>
      <p>"He does have a mischievous side though and likes taking shoes, which we are working on.</p>

      <p>"Xander is a beautiful dark yellow colour, he really stood out in his litter. I’m not surprised he was chosen for the Christmas advert and we hope that one day he will become a wonderful guide dog too.”</p>
      <p>The charity hopes the advert will encourage people to sponsor a guide dog this Christmas, helping to finance them through from six weeks to their are fully qualified.</p>
      <p>Once they have passed all their tests, every dog is matched to someone with a visual impairment.</p>

      <p>Maria Novell, Guide Dogs’ director of fundraising, says: “Henry’s journey is what our Sponsor a Puppy scheme is all about – puppies with a true purpose. We hope this TV advert resonates with the public and encourages them to sponsor a puppy, which will ultimately help us raise vital funds for our life-changing work.</p>
      <p>"Animation is a brand-new direction for Guide Dogs, and Christmas is a time where TV advertising is eagerly anticipated by the public. Henry’s story stands out as a reminder that it’s also a time for charitable giving and helping others.”</p>
      <p>The advert will premier at 7pm tonight.</p>
