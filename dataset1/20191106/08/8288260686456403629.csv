A night at the casino with the Peaky Blinders is among a cracking season of Christmas entertainment that comes with all the trimmings at The Castle Hotel in Tamworth.
The gangster-themed whirl is part of a fun and imaginative festive party programme that also includes Fawlty Towers comedy, cabaret and live swing music.
It’s not just The Shelby mob leading festivities, with musicians and actors bringing to life the likes of superstars including Basil Fawlty, Rod Stewart, Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack

Friends, families and works colleagues can dine in style with lavish festive lunches and dinners that are available throughout December, including Christmas Day, in an historic listed building that has been fully modernised with two unique banqueting suites.
The hotel has pulled out all the stops with a Christmas Day menu and is also laying on a festive Sunday carvery in the restaurant with a choice of starters, hand-carved meats with fresh veg and home-made desserts. Both are expected to be popular, so booking in advance is highly advised.
Children can also meet Santa at a special festive lunch days before Christmas, making The Castle Hotel a superb destination for all all ages.
Here’s the low-down on this year’s entertainment...
What’s on offer?
