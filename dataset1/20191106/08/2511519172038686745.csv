The Batman, which will star Robert Pattinson as the caped crusader, may have just found its Penguin.
Matt Reeves will write and direct the new film that will also star Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman.
Last month, it ws reported that Jonah Hill had dropped out of negotiations after producers told him he was wanted for the role of the villainous Penguin instead of the Riddler, who’ll be played by Paul Dano.
Now, according to Deadline, Warner Bros has set its sights on Colin Farrell for the role in what would be his first superhero film since 2003’s Daredevil.
The Wrap reports that Andy Serkis, who’ll direct Venom 2, is in line to play Bruce Wayne’s trusted butler, Alfred Pennyworth.
The Penguin was most memorably played by Danny DeVito in Tim Burton’s Batman Returns. Meanwhile, since 1989, Pennyworth has been played by Michael Gough, Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons.
The Batman is expected to start filming in early 2020 ahead of a release date of 25 June 2021.
Reeves's most recent film was the 2017 sequel War for the Planet of the Apes.
