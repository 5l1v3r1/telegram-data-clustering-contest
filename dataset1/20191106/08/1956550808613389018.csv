The world's largest mobile maze is back in the UAE, somehow in two places at once.Last December the maze took up temporary residency at Umm Al Emarat Park, in Abu Dhabi, challenging children to find their way out of the massive labyrinth.Now the experience has moved to the Garden City of Al Ain and Dubai.The Wonder Maze, consisting of a series of paths made out of thousands of metres of rope and tarpaulin, will be at Al Ain Zoo and Riverland Dubai until April 2020.The attraction will be open from 9am to 8pm at Al Ain Zoo and 2.30pm to 10pm Sunday to Thursday and 10am to 10pm Friday and Saturday in Dubai.The maze costs Dhs35 and is free for children under one metre in height.Entrance to Al Ain zoo is not included in the ticket price.Tickets to the zoo start from Dhs9.45 for children under the age of twelve and Dhs28.25 for adults.Think you can conquer it? The configuration of the maze will be changed regularly, so if you figure it the first time you try it the chances are next time you visit you will have to find the right path once again.At the centre of the maze there's a five-metre tall viewing platform, meaning you can see how to get out more easily.“We are absolutely delighted to bring The Wonder Maze to Al Ain Zoo, one of the most popular family destinations in Al Ain,” says The Wonder Maze Amusement LLC manager Lee Holmes.“The Wonder Maze will assist in increasing team building skills and use critical thinking.”“We are confident that this spectacular maze will appeal to every age group, from small children to grandparents; anyone with an inquisitive mind and who wants to discover what's around the next corner will love it.”Dhs35 (free for children under one metre in height). Zoo entry Dhs9.45 for children and Dhs28.25 for adults. Until April 22 2020. Al Ain Zoo: 9am-8pm. Riverland Dubai: Sun-Thu 9am-8pm; Fri-Sat 10am-10pm.
