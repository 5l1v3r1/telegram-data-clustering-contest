      <p>The firm will start slow with the ZS EV, and launch the electric SUV in five cities to begin with. Once there is greater acceptance, infrastructure and a trained dealer network, the EV will be launched in more cities.  The <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mg/hector-m758/">MG Hector</a>'s production schedule will not affect the ZS EV either. The two cars are independent programmes and built on separate lines.</p>
