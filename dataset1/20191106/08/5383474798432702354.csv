iOS 13.3 fixed iPhone RAM bug. Applications are no longer unloaded
06 Nov 2019, 08:10 by Artyom Bausov
With the release of iOS 13.2, users massively complained about the poor performance of RAM, applications were constantly unloaded.
In particular, the problem affected YouTube and Safari.
In iOS 13.3 beta 1, a bug was fixed. Users of the forum MacRumors and Twitter note that the programs have ceased to crash.



iOS 13.3 Beta seems to fix the problem of reloading applications and managing RAM. I opened 32 programs, and they have not yet rebooted on the iPhone 11 Pro Max



iOS 13.3 Beta 1 finally fixed RAM problems



iOS 13.3 seems to have fixed aggressive RAM management
We, in turn, can also confirm that now the programs have stopped arbitrarily reloading when switching between them. Tell us in the comments if you noticed a change. [MacRumors]
