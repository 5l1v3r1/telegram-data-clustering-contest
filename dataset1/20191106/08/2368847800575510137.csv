06 Nov 2019, 08:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】颱風哈吉貝(另稱海貝思)侵襲日本造成多條河川氾濫，造成長野市赤沼的新幹線車輛中心的120節車廂泡水。因考量安全性與安定性，JR東日本公司決定報廢北陸新幹線8編組96節車箱，重新製造車廂，估算損失上看118億日圓(約1.09億美元)。
日本放送協會（NHK）報導，北陸新幹線車廂總計有10編組120節在這次千曲川氾濫中泡水，其中JR東日本公司有意報廢擁有的其中8編組96節。
JR東日本公司正在研究，報廢車廂中的部分零組件是否可以留作他用。
另外，目前減班運行的北陸新幹線，JR東日本公司希望月底時讓東京往來金澤列車班次恢復到正常水準，並在今年度結束前，讓所有列車班次恢復正常時刻表。
