'This Is How' is out now.

The estate of the late George Michael has released ‘This Is How (We Want You To Get High)’, the first posthumous track to arrived from the late music icon.
The track will feature on the soundtrack of Last Christmas – the upcoming movie inspired by his legendary back catalogue.
It received its  first play on BBC Radio 2’s The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on Wednesday, November 6.
“The previously unreleased track, which was recorded during George’s final studio sessions, is his first original material to be shared for seven years,” a press release said.
“The lyrics, written exclusively by George, see the star addressing society’s ills with his trademark blend of self-deprecation and wry humor.”
It is also accompanied by a lyric video which features animations of Michael performing.



An upbeat effort, Michael sings on the track: “Your daddy was a drinker”, “My daddy was a toker”
The soundtrack for the festive movie will feature three Wham! songs, including ‘Last Christmas’ and ‘Everything She Wants’, alongside 12 of Michael’s solo songs.
The festive rom-com is directed by Bridesmaids‘ Paul Feig and stars Emilia Clarke as a fed-up seasonal worker who keeps bumping into Henry Golding’s character around London in serendipitous circumstances.
It also stars Emma Thompson, who has penned the film, as Clarke’s mother.
Speaking recently, Thompson explained how Michael gave her his personal blessing to create the upcoming film.
“He was just the loveliest guy you could imagine,” she recalled of their meeting. “[He loved] all of these themes in the movie; he was passionate about homelessness, and he had this great social conscience.”
Thompson continued: “I got really enthused and we started to write, and then – of course – he had that tragic early death in 2016, on Christmas Day. So we lost him, and I miss him so much.”
