      <p>Cybersecurity firm Sophos today posted a loss for the first half of the year, blaming restructuring and legal costs.</p>
      <p>The UK listed firm is set to be taken private after accepting a £3bn takeover bid from US private equity firm Thoma Bravo last month. </p>
      <p>It today announced a loss before tax of $1.5m (£1.16m) for the six months to 30 September, which it said was due to restructuring and legal costs.</p>

      <p>It said its $26m profit in the first half last year was also boosted by an exceptional credit.</p>
      <p>Reported group revenue of $365.8m grew five per cent year-on-year and eight per cent at constant currency.</p>
      <p>It said exceptional items were a net expense of $14.3m during the period compared to a net credit of $5.5m in the prior year.</p>
      <p>Sophos said its expenses arose as a result of restructuring costs, legal costs and legal and professional fees incurred in connection with a review of “apparent non-compliance with certain regulatory matters pertaining to the use of some of the group’s products in certain overseas territories”.</p>

      <p>Sophos shareholders are yet to approve Thoma Bravo’s offer of $7.40 per share to take the company private.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Kris Hagerman said: “Our performance in H1 FY20 shows the continued progress we are making towards fully transitioning our business to next-generation cybersecurity.  </p>
      <p>“As we pursue this strategy, we are benefiting from our advanced capabilities and investments in the cloud, machine-learning, APIs, synchronized security, automation, managed threat response and more, to deliver enterprise-grade protection to organisations of any size.”</p>
