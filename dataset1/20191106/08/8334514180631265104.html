      <p>DUSHANBE (Reuters) - Masked Islamic State militants attacked a border post on the Tajik-Uzbek border overnight, triggering a gun battle that killed 15 of the militants, a guard and a policeman, Tajik authorities said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate announcement from the militant group, which has claimed responsibility for a series of assaults in Tajikistan in recent months.</p>
      <p>Five of the gunmen were captured after the attack on the Tajik side of the border, 50 km (30 miles) southwest of the capital Dushanbe, Tajikistan’s National Security Committee said.</p>
      <p>It released a photograph showing the badly burned bodies of three men in black military-style outfits, lying on the ground next to a wrecked car.</p>
      <p>The committee said the gunmen had entered the former Soviet republic earlier this month via its border with Afghanistan and were “on a special mission”.</p>
      <p>Islamic State claimed responsibility for the killing of four Western cyclists in Tajikistan last year and for a prison riot in May which left dozens dead.</p>
      <p>The jihadi group, whose main stronghold was in Iraq and Syria before its territorial defeat, has recruited thousands of fighters from Central Asia, where Sunni Islam is the dominant religion.</p>
      <p>Tajikistan, the poorest country in the ex-Soviet region, is particularly vulnerable to militancy because of its porous border with Afghanistan, which has a long history of conflict between the government and jihadi groups.</p>
      <p>In recent years, cells linked to or inspired by Islamic State have also been operating in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The Dushanbe government has offered amnesty to those who quit Islamic State and return home, provided they have committed no other crimes.</p>
      <p>Two other Central Asian nations - Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan - have this year brought home hundreds of people from Syria and Iraq, mostly women and children who were family members of Islamic State recruits.</p>
