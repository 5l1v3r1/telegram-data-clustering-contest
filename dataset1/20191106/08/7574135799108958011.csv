Big Bite releasing ‘Trinity’ (watch the “Blue Nine” video)
06 Nov 2019, 08:39 by Andrew Sacher



Seattle’s Big Bite (one of the bands of Matt Berry, also of The Berries and Happy Diving) are releasing a new album, Trinity, on November 15 via Pop Wig (pre-order). They recently put out the singles “The River” and “Blue Nine,” and we’re now premiering the video for “Blue Nine.” The song is a dose of sludgy slacker rock that sort of sounds like a shoegazier Dinosaur Jr, and the video puts a psychedelic twist on everyday life. Check it out below.
The band also have some West Coast dates coming up, including a Portland show with past tourmates Nothing. All dates are listed below.






Tracklist1. The River2. Archangel3. Blue Nine4. The Altar5. Monte6. Pure Bliss7. Still Haunts Me8. Trinity
