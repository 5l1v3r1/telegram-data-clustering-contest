      <h1>Hector Bellerin opens up on dressing room reaction to Granit Xhaka losing captaincy</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery stripped Granit Xhaka of the Arsenal captain following his run-in with fans at the Emirates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:10:49+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Hector Bellerin says the Arsenal dressing room respects Unai Emery's decision to strip Granit Xhaka of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>There were fears Emery would have a revolt on his hands amid calls from fans for the Swiss to lose the armband after he clashed with Gunners supporters.</p>
      <p>Xhaka reacted badly to fans booing him at the Emirates during the draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> and responded by cupping his ears, swearing, removing his shirt and storming off down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Emery confirmed on Tuesday, on the eve of Arsenal's Europa League clash with Vitoria, that Xhaka was no longer in his pool of captains.</p>
      <p>And, according to Bellerin, the Gunners changing room backs the decision.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes it's hard to deal with like feelings," said Bellerin. "He made a mistake but as a dressing room we have to be together.</p>
      <p>"These things happen and that's it. We back him. He is playing his part now. We respect the players, we respect the decision of the coach and the club.</p>
      <p>"For us it's just to give him our love and care. He's one of us so we're just helping him get through it."</p>

      <p>Emery made his decision to strip Xhaka of the captaincy after a chat with the Swiss.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was speaking with him this morning and also I decided he is not one of the captain's in the group. And also I told the other captains the decision.</p>

      <p>"We need to carry on and focus for tomorrow's match and next Saturday's match.</p>
      <p>"I needed to make a decision and now it is closed. I needed to make a decision and now it is closed. I told first Xhaka and then the captains and for me it's finished."</p>
