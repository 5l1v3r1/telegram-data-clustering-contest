      <h1>WhatsApp's new feature is perfect if you're always being added to annoying group chats</h1>
      <h2>WhatsApp has rolled out new ways for users to stop people adding them to group chats without their permission</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T08:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Whether it’s ‘Family Chat’ or ‘Carol’s Hen Do’, many <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>users find themselves constantly being added to annoying new groups.</p>
      <p>But the days of having to mute such chats could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to WhatsApp’s latest feature.</p>
      <p>The app has rolled out new ways for users to stop people adding them to group chats without their permission.</p>
      <p>In a blog announcing the update, a spokesperson for WhatsApp explained: “As people turn to groups for important conversations, users have asked for more control over their experience.</p>
      <p>“Today, we're introducing a new privacy setting and invite system to help you decide who can add you to groups.”</p>

      <h3>How to set up Group Permissions</h3>
      <p>The new permissions can be enabled in the Settings section of the app, then Account &gt; Privacy &gt; Groups.</p>
      <p>There, you’ll find three options - Everyone, My Contacts, or My Contacts Except.</p>
      <p>My Contacts means only users you have in your address book can add you to a group, while My Contacts Except lets you pinpoint particular users who you’d prefer were unable to add you.</p>
      <p>WhatsApp added: “In those cases, an admin who can’t add you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group.</p>
      <p>“You'll have three days to accept the invite before it expires.”</p>
      <p>The update is available from today on both iOS and Android.</p>
