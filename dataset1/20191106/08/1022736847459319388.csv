Hali ya wasiwasi yaendelea kutanda Sudani Kusini
06 Nov 2019, 08:22 by RFI

Mazungumzo kati ya pande zinazohasimiana nchini Sudan Kusini yameahirishwa kwa siku mbili, wakati huu kukiwa na wasiwasi kuhusu uwezekano wa kuundwa kwa Serikali ya umoja ifikapo Novemba 12.

Mazungumzo kati ya rais Salva Kiir na mwenzake Riek Machar yalikuwa yafanyike Jumanne wiki hii lakini yakaahirishwa bila ya uwepo wa sababu za msingi.
Taarifa kutoka taasisi zinazosimamia mchakato wa amani nchini humo, zinasema kuwa viongozi hao wawili hawajaonesha nia ya kuwa tayari kufanya kazi pamoja.
Aidha madai ya rais Kiir kuwa ataunda Serikali peke yake bila ya Machar yanazidisha sintofahamu zaidi kuhusu mustakabali wa nchi hiyo.

Concern continues to spread in South Sudan
06 Nov 2019, 08:22 by RFI

Negotiations between rival factions in South Sudan have been postponed for two days, this time with concerns about the possible formation of a united government by November 12.

Negotiations between president Salva Kiir and his colleague Riek Machar were to take place on Tuesday this week but were adjourned without the presence of primary cause.
Reports from the country's peacekeeping agencies say that the two leaders have not shown their willingness to work together.
In addition, President Kiir's claim that he will form the Government alone without Machar further deepens the future of the country.
