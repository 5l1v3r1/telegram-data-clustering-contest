Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker is facing severe backlash on social media for abusing a four-year-old child actor as she recalled an incident on the chat show Son Of Abish.
A video spreading like wildfire on social media shows Swara using the swear words for a child actor with whom she worked with in an advertisement shoot during her early days in the film industry.
Apparently, Swara got angry because the child had addressed her as aunty.



In the video clip, the Veere Di Wedding actor is seen speaking about how disappointed she was with the shoot, adding that the kid calling her “aunty” only made her angrier.
According to Swara, children were basically “evil” and this kid was only a brat, throwing tantrums.
Twitterati started slamming the actor as soon as the video went viral, and the hashtag #SwaraAunty has been trending on the micro-blogging website since Tuesday morning.












According to IBTimes, an NGO – Legal Rights Protection Forum – has reportedly filed a complaint to National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and demanded action against Swara.
