聯合國報告：美中貿易戰下，台灣是最大「贏家」？
06 Nov 2019, 08:26 by 羊正鈺


我們想讓你知道的是除了台灣之外，《CNN》在7月報導指出越南、孟加拉和南韓也坐收漁利，《QUARTZ》在8月的分析則認為，澳洲、瑞士、墨西哥、巴西及加拿大才是5大受益國。



（中央社）聯合國研究報告顯示，美國和中國的貿易戰，使今年上半年美國從中國進口、受關稅影響商品減少350億美元，並使美國物價上漲，損及消費者荷包，台灣則是貿易轉移最大受益者。不過，不同的時間、媒體報導下的「贏家」似乎也不太一樣。
根據這份今天公布的研究報告，台灣今年上半年對美出口較去年同期增加42億美元，增加的部分大多是辦公室和通訊設備。
美中這兩個世界最大經濟體的貿易戰已打了16個月，雙方本月簽署初步貿易協議的希望濃厚，如果談判再度破裂，幾乎所有中國輸美產品可能都會受到影響。中國原本每年輸美商品總額高達5000多億美元。
聯合國貿易和發展會議（UNCTAD）的報告顯示，今年上半年美國從中國進口的商品，受到加徵關稅影響的項目，由去年同期的1300億美元降至950億美元，減幅超過1/4。
報告指出：「整體而言，結果顯示美國對中國加徵關稅損及兩國經濟，美國的損失大多和物價上漲，損及消費者荷包有關，中國的損失則和出口大減有關。」
這份報告的作者、聯合國貿易和發展會議經濟學家尼吉塔（Alessandro Nicita）表示，隨著時間推移，中國企業今年上半年透過降低出口價格8%，吸收部分關稅增加的費用，但是仍有17%落在「美國消費者的肩上」。
報告指出，中國受創最重的產業是辦公室機器和通訊設備，對美出口下滑150億美元，隨著美國不斷調高關稅，出口損失將越來越大。

台灣是貿易轉移最大受益者，其次是墨西哥。
墨西哥今年上半年對美出口增加35億美元，增加的大多是農業、運輸以及電機設備。歐洲聯盟則增加27億美元，增加的大多是機械。
尼吉塔指出：「貿易戰持續的時間越長，這些貿易轉移就越有可能是永久性的。」


中美貿易戰達成初步協議，但為何「別太樂觀」？


《中央社》報導，台灣經濟部次長王美花今天在立法院備詢時表示，根據統計，截至9月為止，台灣對中國出口減少7.2%，對美出口增加17.7%。
王美花進一步指出，截至上週為止，已有151家台商回台，數量非常驚人；目前已經回來的台商會在台灣生產，因為這是長期布局。另一方面，她也坦言，台灣工具機、機械業等業者確實受到中國訂單減少影響，廠商需要強化升級轉型。
美中貿易戰的「贏家」還有誰？
《CNN》今年7月的報導，美中大打貿易戰，越南、台灣、孟加拉和南韓坐收漁利，成為這場戰爭的4大贏家，其中美國從越南進口增36%居首，自台灣進口則攀升23%居次。
報導指出，美國消費者為了避免川普（港譯「特朗普」）祭出的關稅，雖減少購買中國貨，卻未掏腰包捧場國貨；反之，他們選擇來自其他亞洲國家的供應商。
根據美國人口調查與統計局（Census Bureau）發布數據顯示，從過去一年多美中貿易談判多次未果以來，便已出現這股現象，一路持續至5月。
今年前5個月，美國自中國進口商品較去年同期減少12%，然而，從越南進口卻增加36%、台灣則攀升23%，孟加拉和南韓也分別成長14%與12%。
對美國進口商來說，川普祭關稅大棒已讓棒球帽、行李箱、自行車和手提包等中國製商品更為昂貴。這些關稅也重擊機械與工業品，包含洗碗機、洗衣機、烘乾機和飲水機的零件。


越南身價因美中貿易戰水漲船高，工人與土地成台商最大挑戰


《自由時報》8月報導，能在貿易戰中撈到好處並成為最大贏家的國家分別為澳洲、瑞士、墨西哥、巴西及加拿大等5國。這些國家之所以能成為最大受惠國，原因是其填補了美中雙邊貿易下滑的缺口。

《QUARTZ》 的分析中顯示，最大贏家是澳洲，其取代了美國，將大量的天然氣、黃金與棉花等商品出口至中國。且加上經濟政局不穩定，讓金價不斷飆高，讓澳洲黃金出口金額又更放大了。瑞士也如澳洲一樣，在中美貿易戰期間，瑞士黃金出口至中國的數量就成長逾3倍。
此外，墨西哥在今年上半年已超越中國，成為美國的最大貿易國。因為中國製的資料處理、儲存設備、電線和光纖電纜等產品成為被課徵25%關稅對象，墨西哥製的產品趁機大批出口美國。
《鉅亨網》報導，墨西哥一直是美國公司尋求廉價勞動力的首選標的，墨西哥、美國和加拿大去年簽署了一項新的貿易協議USMCA，旨在取代北美自由貿易協定。美國商會國際政策資深副總裁John Murphy也認為，與東南亞地區等擁有廉價勞動力的選擇相比，墨西哥作為製造和出口平台有許多關鍵優勢：

墨西哥與美國市場非常接近，並且與美國享有免關稅優惠
美國和墨西哥之間相對較小的文化差距多年來逐漸縮小
兩國之間的實質性融合（3600萬墨西哥裔美國人、每年數千億的雙邊貿易額、美國在墨西哥超過1000億美元的直接投資）
國內和跨境的基礎設施連接不斷改善

而巴西則透過大豆、棉花為填補美國大豆缺口，大量出口至中國，成為中國最佳替代美國農產品的國家。
加拿大扮演的則是中、美雙邊市場通吃的角色，像是加拿大的晶片、電路板和工業模具取代中國商品，出口至美國；加拿大也向中國出口大量該國大豆，作為填補美國大豆的空缺。

UN report: Under the US-China trade war, is Taiwan the biggest ""winner""?
06 Nov 2019, 08:26 by 羊正钰


What we want you to know is that in addition to Taiwan, CNN reported in July that Vietnam, Bangladesh and South Korea also took profits. The analysis of QUARTZ in August concluded that Australia, Switzerland, Mexico, Brazil and Canada It is the top 5 beneficiary countries.



(Central News Agency) The United Nations research report shows that the trade war between the United States and China has caused the United States to reduce its tariff-affected goods from China by 35 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, and to increase US prices and damage consumers’ pockets. Taiwan is a trade shift. The biggest beneficiary. However, the ""winners"" under different time and media reports seem to be different.
According to the research report released today, Taiwan’s exports to the US in the first half of this year increased by 4.2 billion U.S. dollars compared with the same period of last year. Most of the increase was mainly in office and communication equipment.
The trade war between the two world's largest economies has been 16 months. The hopes of the two sides signing a preliminary trade agreement this month are strong. If the negotiations break down again, almost all Chinese exports to the US may be affected. China’s original annual exports of goods to the United States totaled more than $500 billion.
According to the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the US imports of goods from China in the first half of this year were affected by tariff increases, from $130 billion in the same period last year to $95 billion, a decrease of more than a quarter.
The report pointed out: ""Overall, the results show that the United States imposes tariffs on China and damages the economies of both countries. Most of the losses in the United States are related to rising prices and damage to consumer purses. China's losses are related to the sharp decline in exports.""
The author of the report, Alessandro Nicita, an economist at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said that over time, Chinese companies have absorbed some of the increased tariffs by lowering the export price by 8% in the first half of this year, but still 17% fall on the shoulders of American consumers.
According to the report, China's most hit industries are office machines and communications equipment. Exports to the US fell by $15 billion. As the United States continues to raise tariffs, export losses will increase.

Taiwan is the biggest beneficiary of trade transfers, followed by Mexico.
Mexico’s exports to the United States increased by 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, mostly due to agriculture, transportation and electrical equipment. The European Union has increased by $2.7 billion, mostly mechanical.
Nikita pointed out: ""The longer the trade war lasts, the more likely these trade transfers will be permanent.""


The Sino-US trade war reached a preliminary agreement, but why ""don't be too optimistic""?


""Central News Agency"" reported that Taiwan’s economic minister Wang Meihua said in a Legislative Yuan today that according to statistics, as of September, Taiwan’s exports to China decreased by 7.2%, and exports to the United States increased by 17.7%.
Wang Meihua further pointed out that as of last week, there have been 151 Taiwanese businessmen returning to Taiwan, the number is very amazing; the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce has returned in Taiwan, because this is a long-term layout. On the other hand, she also admitted that Taiwan's machine tools, machinery and other industries are indeed affected by the reduction of Chinese orders, and manufacturers need to strengthen the upgrade and transformation.
Who else is the ""winner"" of the US-China trade war?
CNN reported in July this year that the US-China trade war, Vietnam, Taiwan, Bangladesh and South Korea took profits and became the top four winners of the war. Among them, the United States imported 36% from Vietnam and imported from Taiwan. Then climbed 23%.
The report pointed out that in order to avoid the tariffs imposed by Trump (translated by Trump), American consumers did not pay for the purchase of Chinese goods, but they chose suppliers from other Asian countries.
According to data released by the Census Bureau, this phenomenon has occurred since the US-China trade negotiations have been unsuccessful for many times in the past year, and it continues until May.
In the first five months of this year, US imports from China decreased by 12% compared with the same period of last year. However, imports from Vietnam increased by 36%, Taiwan increased by 23%, and Bangladesh and South Korea also grew by 14% and 12% respectively.
For US importers, Trump’s tariff bar has made Chinese-made goods such as baseball caps, suitcases, bicycles and handbags more expensive. These tariffs also hit machinery and industrial products, including parts for dishwashers, washing machines, dryers and water dispensers.


Vietnam’s worth is due to the rise of US-China trade, and workers and land become the biggest challenge for Taiwanese businessmen.


The Free Times reported in August that the countries that can benefit from the trade war and become the biggest winners are Australia, Switzerland, Mexico, Brazil and Canada. The reason why these countries can become the biggest beneficiary is that it fills the gap between the US-China bilateral trade decline.

According to the analysis of QUARTZ, the biggest winner is Australia, which replaced the United States and exported a large amount of natural gas, gold and cotton to China. Coupled with the instability of the economic situation, the price of gold has continued to rise, making the amount of Australian gold exports even larger. Switzerland is also like Australia. During the Sino-US trade war, the number of Swiss gold exports to China has grown more than threefold.
In addition, Mexico has surpassed China in the first half of this year and became the largest trading nation of the United States. Because the Chinese-made data processing, storage equipment, wires and fiber-optic cables have become subject to a 25% tariff, the Mexican-made products have been exported to the United States in large numbers.
""Heng Heng Net"" reported that Mexico has always been the preferred target for US companies seeking cheap labor. Mexico, the United States and Canada signed a new trade agreement USMCA last year to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy at the American Chamber of Commerce, also believes that Mexico has many key advantages as a manufacturing and export platform compared to options such as Southeast Asia that have cheap labor:

Mexico is very close to the US market and enjoys duty-free privileges with the United States.
The relatively small cultural gap between the United States and Mexico has gradually narrowed over the years.
Substantial integration between the two countries (36 million Mexican-Americans, hundreds of billions of bilateral trade each year, and more than $100 billion in direct investment by the United States in Mexico)
Domestic and cross-border infrastructure connectivity continues to improve

Brazil, through soybeans and cotton, has filled the US soybean gap and exported it to China, making it the best country to replace American agricultural products.
Canada plays a role in the bilateral market in China and the United States. For example, Canadian wafers, circuit boards and industrial molds replace Chinese goods and are exported to the United States. Canada also exports a large amount of soybeans to China as a vacancy to fill US soybeans. .


The United States and Mexico signed a new trade agreement, and the speech of the thorny Duludao confirmed the ""True of Trump""?


The United States and Japan signed a trade agreement: 90% of the agricultural products sales day have the same treatment as the TPP, and the Japanese automobile tariffs are ""not added for the time being""
