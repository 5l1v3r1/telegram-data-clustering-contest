貿易戰下的俄中關係（下）：普亭在俄中關係拉起的警戒線
06 Nov 2019, 08:00 by 台灣歐洲聯盟研究協會


我們想讓你知道的是普丁和戰兩手戰略的並用，除了上述利用輿情與經濟層面，俄羅斯與印度在東方經濟論壇允諾共同開展軍事研發，俄軍備鉅額販售印度、且持續武裝越南、與日本共同開發北方四島，意在強化中國邊境鄰國對中的包圍施壓。

貿易戰下的俄中關係（上）：俄羅斯與中國真的是彼此的「應許之地」?


位於中國東北邊境進入日本海的唯一通道，地處中國、朝鮮、俄羅斯三國交界地帶的城市「琿春」，不時就有俄羅團客包下餐廳唱歌跳舞，席間吃著朝鮮冷麵、琿春黃牛全餐，並談妥了各式海鮮進口中國的事宜。
這個人口約廿五萬、朝鮮人與漢人比例各半的邊境口岸，不僅三語交替使用，串連圖們江經濟圈貿易，幅散至韓國釜山（Busan）、日本新瀉（Niigata）、俄羅斯海參崴（Vladivostok）的巨大經濟動能，同樣吸引著臺灣商賈，承諾每年約1300萬美金的生意往來。
圖們江經濟圈合併俄羅斯遠東地區、中國東北地區以及朝鮮羅津（Rason）先鋒經濟特區的陸海空環狀經濟廊道，支撐著俄羅斯主辦的東方經濟論壇（Eastern Economic Forum）持續擴大多國與俄中各自東境的經貿合作。

攤開甫落幕的東方經濟論壇內涵，圍繞著「加快經濟增長新方案」、「創造商業運營環境」、「遠東與亞太地區共同發展合作潛力」以及「提升生活質量」四大主題展開，吸引六十五國八千多人次參與、短短三天就創下合作備忘錄簽署金額接近兩兆新臺幣的新紀錄（約臺灣中央政府年度總預算）。
近兩百人組成的中國代表團魚貫而入東方經濟論壇會場，印度總理莫迪、日本首相安倍晉三、蒙古國總統巴特圖勒嘎、馬來西亞總理馬哈蒂緊接在後，甚至無視川普下令經濟制裁的美商IBM、萬事達等廿家美國公司，紛紛相繼進場欲了解，俄遠東地區在過去五年經濟成長高於全俄兩倍的爆發力與潛在商機。
因為各國都了解中國豐沛的內需市場與資本移轉的動能旺盛，即便佔據俄羅斯遠東地區的外國投資近六成的高比例，但住在俄中邊界整片廣袤沃土之上的俄國人民，已帶動全國超過百萬人次的網路連署，要求俄羅斯中央政府平均各國在遠東的投資，停止中國染指貝加爾湖及西伯利亞的企圖。
貿易戰下的俄中互惠
「中國開始購買我們的農產品，我向中國國家主席習近平轉達我們的謝意。中國希望簽訂貿易協議，我們也將看看會怎麼樣。」美國總統川普在聯合國大會蓄意透過媒體留下的訊息，對正在緊盯美中貿易戰的各國來說，已經司空見慣。
但中國內需市場面對美國各式原物料的出口不時斷供、價格又是每月浮動、關稅還有可能持續上調的情況，中國緊急向鄰國俄羅斯尋求調撥中國國內市場需求的強度，從數據上顯現的一覽無遺。
中國不僅成為俄羅斯的第一大貿易夥伴，雙邊貿易額在2018年除了首次突破一千億美金，俄羅斯更平衡了對中貿易長久以來的逆差，按照2019年雙邊貿易至今成長30%左右的增長速度，預估五年內俄中雙邊貿易會再翻一倍來到兩千億美金，中國對俄逐年貿易的成長趨勢，未因美中貿易戰而有所趨緩。
中國今年上半年在原油、煤炭以及天然氣進口增加幅度，以超過5%的幅度增長，但值得注意的是大豆進口不但減少了近15%、今年5月至7月，中國的豬、雞、牛、羊肉進口總額躍升近70%，完全暴露中國在貿易戰與非洲豬瘟交織下的國內市場，急需進口肉品平抑災情。
過去大豆與肉類依賴美國進口的中國，直接在東方經濟論壇宣布，由中國中糧集團與俄羅斯農業集團和阿穆爾農業聯合體，分別簽署了大豆進口意向協議，希望向俄羅斯遠東當地的農業生產企業，傳遞放心生產必定收購的信號。而俄羅斯遠東和北極發展部早前也公布，今年第一季度俄農業和農副產品加工業出口額，有超過40%出口到中國，俄羅斯遠東未來將逐步增加牛奶、禽肉、大豆和豆製品出口。

由於俄羅斯農業的潛力甚鉅，俄羅斯除了出口傳統的原油、礦物、漁產、木材加工等貿易，俄中雙方正在創新農業合作方式，例如中國中鼎聯合牧業有限公司在濱海邊疆區建立奶牛飼養場，將原奶運回中國；大量俄羅斯蜂蜜、巧克力、冰淇淋與糖果都在中國市場獲得突破性的消費肯定。
中國出口方面除了機電產品、紡織、家具等民生用品，一向是進入俄羅斯市場的主力，光電技術、生物工程、環境保護等領域，同中國東北與俄羅斯遠東開展科技合作，中國新國門北京大興機場（Beijing Daxing International Airport）的落成，也正式宣告世界中國科研技術已達世界水平。
這片約等於98座足球場的世界最大機場，是首座三鐵直接穿越機場地面，六大軌道幅散近1億多人次的吞吐量，不僅克服施工技術的艱困、臉部辨識技術、無感無紙通關、停車機器人系統建置，可再生能源總量佔機場年綜合能源消費總量12%左右，是目前中國運用可再生能源比例最高的機場。
當先進的科研技術與5G網絡技術合併威權擴散模式，以臉部辨識監視器監控異議份子的企圖，就會包裝在中國收購並與俄羅斯電信簽署的合約中。簡言之，中國華為技術（Huawei）同俄國最大電信商MTS簽訂5G合約，雙方合作開發5G網絡至今，已由俄羅斯Beeline電信公司證實。華為創新技術在莫斯科盧日尼基體育場區域（Luzhniki Stadium）已完成5G網絡測試，單用戶裝置最高傳輸速率可達2.19Gbps。
此外，華為亦收購了俄羅斯人臉識別系統開發公司Vokord，華為在中國國內已完備的人臉識別演算法，將配合Vocord的HD智慧攝影機以及5G網絡，在最快的時間辨識每個角落的俄羅斯人。
華為、海康威視、大華和中興等中國公司的AI監控技術，使華為透過俄羅斯電商「綁定」俄羅斯用戶個資與大數據運用，以一帶一路及俄中雙方互惠之名進入俄羅斯，建構「安全城市計畫」及「天網系統」，中國整體國力凌駕俄羅斯的趨勢，已是不可逆的事實。

俄中心存芥蒂
中國籍移工、中國留學生、中國觀光客、中國資本持續進入俄羅斯各地活動與併購，中國軍隊開始進駐前蘇聯國家塔吉克（Tajikistan），建立軍事基地並演習；前蘇聯國家哈薩克（Kazakhstan）打破過去俄羅斯在中亞油管上的壟斷，不僅開放中國併購與參股哈薩克石油公司；中國－中亞天然氣管道、中哈石油管道的完工；哈薩克被指名為中國「一帶一路」的橋頭堡等跡證，顯現中國不僅全面深入俄羅斯、俄羅斯過去掌握中亞戰略地位的優勢儼然喪失。
值得注意的是，民族主義作為普亭警示中國的手段，不僅放任俄羅斯全國，連署反對中國在貝加爾湖畔（Lake Baikal）興建瓶裝水工廠、呼籲嚴加取締中國移工在西伯利亞違法違建營利事證、抗議中國在布里亞特地區（Buryatia）違法濫採森林，俄國反對派領袖Alexei Navalny針對俄羅斯恐淪為中國人質，兩國不可能發展出互利且廣獲人民支持的批評也可以暢所欲言。
同時使用假訊息激化吉爾吉斯與哈薩克民眾情緒，對於中資在吉爾吉斯（Kyrgyzstan）發電廠工程中貪腐、哈薩克多城抗議中資不停擴張，種種可以威嚇中國在中亞及俄羅斯邊境插手的政治事件並用，突顯俄羅斯明確地在俄中關係拉起警戒線。
俄羅斯受制於中國實力的崛起與歐美關係的惡化，一方面必須將最新型的T－80BVM坦克編入俄軍第38近衛機械化步兵旅，防衛俄羅斯與中國黑龍江省邊境。
另一方面隨著氣候暖化牽動北極航道的通航與開發，俄羅斯苦於資金規模，距離北極理事會（Arctic Council）的美國、加拿大、丹麥（代表格陵蘭與法羅群島）、挪威、冰島、瑞典與芬蘭等諸國聯盟，有著極大的差距，必須拉攏位居北極觀察國且與俄關係較好的中國與印度，一同加入北極圈共同開發，以免俄羅斯在北極航道的影響力弱化。
普亭和戰兩手戰略的並用，除了上述利用輿情與經濟層面，俄羅斯與印度在東方經濟論壇允諾共同開展軍事研發，俄軍備鉅額販售印度、且持續武裝越南、與日本共同開發北方四島，意在強化中國邊境鄰國對中的包圍施壓。
此外，趁勢在美國邀請俄羅斯重返八大工業國組織（G8），重提中印必須同步加入壯大隊伍，除了可確保俄羅斯面對歐美將有堅實的依靠之外，將與中國具有領土糾紛的印度，逐漸拉抬至國際大國的領導地位，平衡中國的地緣政治影響，都是普亭維持俄羅斯國際影響力的必要措施。
由於貿易戰的經濟制裁導致俄中不可避免地緊密合作，無論從國際戰略與人權議題都與歐美倡議的價值相悖，所以端視美中貿易談判與2020美國總統大選選後，如何調整美俄、美中政策，將牽動未來的俄中關係是否全面升化與互相理解。
因為俄中各自的內政困境與彼此互惠，都可靠他國的供應鏈參與協助。過去美國曾在冷戰後調整對俄政策，現下是否拴緊俄中關係的鏍絲，關鍵還在美國如何收放。

Russian-Chinese relations under the trade war (below): Putin's cordon in Russia-China relations
06 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Taiwan European Union Research Association


What we want you to know is the combination of Putin and the two-hand strategy. In addition to the above-mentioned use of public opinion and economic aspects, Russia and India have promised to jointly carry out military research and development at the Eastern Economic Forum. The Russian military has hugely sold India and continues to arm Vietnam. Japan's joint development of the four northern islands is intended to strengthen the pressure on the Chinese border neighbors.

Russia-China relations under the trade war (top): Is Russia and China really the ""promised land"" of each other?


Located in the northeastern border of China, the only way to enter the Sea of Japan is the city of Hunchun, which is located in the border area of China, North Korea and Russia. From time to time, there are Russian singers singing and dancing under the restaurant, eating Korean cold noodles and Hunchun. The ox has a full meal and negotiated the importation of various types of seafood into China.
This border port with a population of about 50,000 and half of the Koreans and Han Chinese is not only used in trilingual, but also in the Tumen River economic circle. It spreads to Busan, Japan, Niigata, Russia. The huge economic momentum of Vladivostok also attracts Taiwanese businessmen and promises to trade about 13 million US dollars a year.
The Tumen River Economic Circle merges with Russia's Far East, Northeast China, and the North Korea's Rason Pioneer Special Economic Zone's land, sea and air ring economy corridor, supporting Russia's Eastern Economic Forum to continue to expand multinational and Russian Economic and trade cooperation in their respective eastern borders.

The connotation of the opening of the Eastern Economic Forum revolves around the four themes of ""accelerating new economic growth plans"", ""creating business operations environment"", ""the potential for common development cooperation between the Far East and the Asia-Pacific region"" and ""improving the quality of life"". More than 8,000 people from 15 countries participated in the competition, and in just three days, the memorandum of cooperation signed a new record of nearly NT$2 trillion (about the annual budget of the Central Government of Taiwan).
A Chinese delegation consisting of nearly 200 people sneaked into the Eastern Economic Forum. Indian Prime Minister Modi, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mongolian President Bartuller and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad immediately followed, even ignoring Trump’s order. US companies such as IBM, MasterCard, and other US companies that have been economically sanctioned have entered the market one after another. The Russian Far East has seen economic growth in the past five years higher than that of all-Russian doubles and potential business opportunities.
Because all countries understand that China’s abundant domestic demand market and capital transfer are strong, even if it accounts for nearly 60% of foreign investment in the Russian Far East, the Russian people living on the vast and fertile land of Russia’s central border have already driven The network of more than one million people across the country has asked the Russian central government to invest in the Far East on average, stopping attempts by China to target the Baikal and Siberia.
Russian-Chinese reciprocity under the trade war
""China began to buy our agricultural products. I conveyed our gratitude to Chinese President Xi Jinping. China hopes to sign a trade agreement, and we will also look at what will happen."" US President Trump deliberately left the message through the media at the UN General Assembly. It is commonplace for countries that are keeping a close eye on the US-China trade war.
However, in the domestic demand market, the export of various raw materials in the United States will be interrupted from time to time, the price will be monthly, and the tariffs may continue to increase. China urgently seeks the strength of China’s domestic market demand from neighboring Russia. The data shows an unobstructed view.
China has not only become Russia's largest trading partner. In addition to the first breakthrough of US$100 billion in bilateral trade in 2018, Russia has balanced the long-standing trade deficit with China. According to the 2019 bilateral trade, it has grown by about 30%. It is estimated that the bilateral trade between Russia and China will double to 200 billion US dollars within five years. The growth trend of China's trade with Russia year by year has not slowed down due to the US-China trade war.
In the first half of this year, China’s imports of crude oil, coal and natural gas increased by more than 5%, but it is worth noting that soybean imports have not only decreased by nearly 15%, but also from May to July this year, Chinese pigs, chickens and cattle. The total imports of mutton jumped nearly 70%, completely exposing China's domestic market under the trade war and African pigs, and urgently need to import meat to stabilize the disaster.
In the past, China, which relied on US imports of soybeans and meat, announced directly at the Eastern Economic Forum that China COFCO and Russia Agricultural Group and Amur Agricultural Consortium signed an agreement on soybean import intention, hoping to pass on the local agricultural production enterprises in the Russian Far East. Rest assured that the signal of the acquisition must be acquired. The Russian Far East and Arctic Development Department also announced earlier that in the first quarter of this year, more than 40% of Russian agricultural and agricultural and sideline products processing exports will be exported to China. The Russian Far East will gradually increase the export of milk, poultry, soybeans and soy products. .

Due to the huge potential of Russian agriculture, Russia and Russia are innovating agricultural cooperation methods in addition to exporting traditional crude oil, minerals, fishery and wood processing. For example, China Zhongding United Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd. established dairy cattle breeding in Primorsky Krai. In the field, the original milk was shipped back to China; a large amount of Russian honey, chocolate, ice cream and candy all achieved breakthrough consumption in the Chinese market.
In addition to mechanical and electrical products, textiles, furniture and other consumer goods, China's exports have always been the main force to enter the Russian market, optoelectronic technology, bioengineering, environmental protection and other fields, and carry out scientific and technological cooperation with Northeast China and the Russian Far East, China's new country, Beijing Daxing Airport ( The completion of Beijing Daxing International Airport has also officially declared that the world's scientific research technology in the world has reached the world level.
This is the world's largest airport, which is equal to 98 football fields. It is the first three railways to directly cross the airport ground. The output of the six major rails is more than 100 million passengers. It not only overcomes the difficulties of construction technology, face recognition technology, and With no paper clearance and parking robot system construction, the total renewable energy accounts for about 12% of the total annual energy consumption of the airport. It is currently the airport with the highest proportion of renewable energy in China.
When advanced scientific research technology and 5G network technology merge the authoritarian diffusion model, and the face recognition monitor monitors the dissidents' attempts, it will be packaged in the contract that China acquired and signed with Russia Telecom. In short, China's Huawei Technologies (Huawei) signed a 5G contract with Russia's largest telecommunications company MTS. The two sides have jointly developed the 5G network, which has been confirmed by the Russian company Beeline Telecom. Huawei's innovative technology has completed 5G network testing at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, with a maximum transmission rate of 2.19 Gbps for single-user devices.
In addition, Huawei also acquired the Russian face recognition system development company Vokord. Huawei has a complete face recognition algorithm in China. It will cooperate with Vocord's HD smart camera and 5G network to identify Russia in every corner in the fastest time. people.
The AI monitoring technology of Chinese companies such as Huawei, Hikvision, Dahua and ZTE has enabled Huawei to ""bind"" Russian users' personal capital and big data through Russian e-commerce, and enter Russia in the name of the Belt and Road and Russia and China. The construction of the ""Safe City Project"" and the ""Skynet System"" is an irreversible fact that China's overall national strength is overriding Russia.

Russian center
Chinese migrant workers, Chinese students, Chinese tourists, Chinese capital continue to enter Russia's activities and mergers and acquisitions, Chinese troops began to enter the former Soviet Union country Tajikstan (Tajikistan), establish military bases and exercises; the former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, broke the past Russia The monopoly on the Central Asian oil pipeline not only opened up China's mergers and acquisitions and shares in Kazakh oil company; China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline, China-Kazakhstan oil pipeline was completed; Kazakh was named as China's ""Belt and Road"" bridgehead and other traces, showing China not only The overall advantage of Russia and Russia's past mastery of the strategic position of Central Asia has been lost.
It is worth noting that nationalism, as a means for Putin to warn China, not only to let Russia go nationwide, but also to oppose China's construction of a bottled water plant on Lake Baikal, calling for the ban on China's migrant workers in Siberia. In protest against China's illegal forests in Buryatia, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is threatening Russia to be a Chinese hostage. The two countries cannot develop mutual criticism and gain popular support from the people.
At the same time, using fake messages to intensify the sentiments of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakh people, the Chinese capital in the Kyrgyzstan power plant project, corruption, Kazakh city protests, Chinese capital continues to expand, all kinds of political events that can intimidate China's intervention in the Central Asian and Russian borders. Combined use, highlighting Russia’s clear cordon in Russia-China relations.
Russia is subject to the rise of China's strength and the deterioration of relations between Europe and the United States. On the one hand, the latest T-80BVM tank must be incorporated into the Russian 38th Guardian Mechanized Infantry Brigade to defend the border between Russia and China's Heilongjiang Province.
On the other hand, as climate warming affects the navigation and development of the Arctic waterway, Russia suffers from the size of the capital, from the Arctic Council to the United States, Canada, Denmark (on behalf of Greenland and Faroe Islands), Norway, Iceland, Sweden and The alliances of countries such as Finland have great gaps. China and India, which are close to the Arctic observer countries and have good relations with Russia, must join the Arctic Circle to develop together to avoid the weakening of Russia's influence on the Arctic waterway.
In addition to the above-mentioned use of lyrics and economic aspects, Russia and India have promised to jointly carry out military research and development at the Eastern Economic Forum. The Russian military has sold a large amount of India, and continues to arm Vietnam and jointly develop the four northern islands with Japan. We are putting pressure on the siege of China's neighboring countries.
In addition, the United States invited Russia to return to the G8 (G8), reiterating that China and India must join the ranks of the team, in addition to ensuring that Russia will have a solid dependence on Europe and the United States, India will have territorial disputes with China. Gradually pulling up the leadership position of the international powers and balancing China's geopolitical influence are all necessary measures for Putin to maintain Russia's international influence.
Due to the economic sanctions of trade wars, Russia and China will inevitably work closely together. Regardless of the value of international strategy and human rights issues, they are inconsistent with the value of European and American initiatives. Therefore, after adjusting the US-China trade negotiations and the 2020 US presidential election, how to adjust the US and Russia, The US-China policy will affect whether the future Russia-China relations will be fully upgraded and understand each other.
Because Russia and China have their own internal dilemmas and mutual reciprocity, they are reliable in the supply chain of other countries to participate in assistance. In the past, the United States adjusted its policy toward Russia after the Cold War. Whether it is now tightening the reel of Russia-China relations, the key is how the United States will retreat.
