「蒜你狠」捲土重來 中國大蒜價格飆漲200%

06 Nov 2019, 08:24

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】繼豬肉、雞蛋之後，「蒜你狠」也捲土重來。中國大蒜再次出現大幅漲價。10月底新蒜的價格較9月底約漲35%，較去年同期約漲200%，創近3年新高。
根據陸媒統計數據，10月底大陸新蒜價格為每公斤7.5元人民幣，較9月底升35%，更比去年同期上升近200%，創下近3年新高。
分析師認為，短期內漲勢不變，預期價格還會更高。
大蒜上漲的原因之一，被指是有產地的商人看到大蒜價格一路飆漲，因此囤貨惜售，導致供應量大減，推高了價格。
大蒜外銷業者稱，從9月底以來，主要大蒜產區山東省濟寧金鄉縣的大蒜價格持續上漲，現在更出現一天一價的恐怖漲勢，讓業者買不下手，而手上已屯數百噸新蒜的業者因為價格仍在漲，也捨不得拋出。

在山東省金鄉天宏商貿有限公司的冷庫裡，儲存著7月份新收購的750噸新蒜，當時這批新蒜的收購價格在每斤3塊7毛錢左右。
大蒜外銷業者表示，現在的蒜頭加上儲存費用，每公斤7.5元人民幣的批發價已經不能支付成本，預計蒜頭價格仍會高起一段時間，可是，如果在明年新年前庫存的蒜頭消化速度不夠快，則可能會令蒜價下跌。目前，買賣雙方都處於觀望態度。
陸媒報導，在北京新發地農產品批發市場，上個週末上午的大蒜交易區有些冷清，只有一些零零散散過來買蒜的人。該批發市場大蒜經銷商張朋表示：「一車賣七八天，八九天，現在銷售比原來慢一半還不止。」
大蒜價格一路高漲還有其它原因，據業者分析，前兩年大蒜種太多致使去年蒜價暴跌，蒜農大幅度棄種，致使今年價格反而暴漲，再加上部分區域受災、外銷出口量激增，導致國內價格一路漲。
據國際大蒜貿易網統計，中國大蒜種植面積在600萬畝左右，今年減種面積約少33%～35%，其中，主產區減種約25%左右。
5月份陸媒曾報導說，今年新蒜收購價較去年高出三四倍。業內人士說，大蒜價格仍有上漲空間。

除了大蒜上漲之外，中國所有的民生物價均節節狂漲，豬肉、雞蛋、水果的價格已經飆升到讓一般民眾心驚地步。
豬肉作為人們最喜歡的食品之一與作為民生的晴雨表和風向標使其重要性不言而喻。
現在大陸市面上豬肉的平均售價已經到了40元一斤了。早在幾個月前，就有人直言要吃不起豬肉了，很多人選擇雞鴨魚羊牛等肉類來替代豬肉，但雞鴨魚羊牛等肉類的物價也隨之水漲船高。
有網民感嘆：「現在什麼都在漲價，只有工資不漲，老百姓的日子還怎麼過啊！」「不只是吃不起豬肉、其它的肉類、雞蛋，蒜也吃不起了，改吃洋蔥替代了。」

""Garlic You"" is making a comeback Chinese garlic prices soaring 200%

06 Nov 2019, 08:24

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] After pork and eggs, ""Garlic You"" is also making a comeback. Chinese garlic has once again seen a sharp increase in prices. At the end of October, the price of new garlic rose by 35% from the end of September, and it rose by 200% compared with the same period of last year, reaching a new high of nearly three years.
According to statistics from the mainland media, the price of new garlic in the mainland at the end of October was 7.5 yuan per kilogram, up 35% from the end of September, and nearly 200% higher than the same period of last year, setting a new high of nearly three years.
Analysts believe that the short-term uptrend will remain unchanged and the price is expected to be even higher.
One of the reasons for the rise in garlic was that the merchants who had the origins saw the price of garlic soaring, so the reluctance to sell the goods led to a sharp drop in supply and pushed up the price.
Garlic exporters said that since the end of September, the price of garlic in Jinxiang County, Jining County, Shandong Province, the main garlic producing area has continued to rise. Now there is a day-to-day terrorist increase, so that the industry can buy hundreds of hands. The manufacturer of tons of new garlic is reluctant to throw because the price is still rising.

In the cold storage of Jinxiang Tianhong Trading Co., Ltd. in Shandong Province, the newly acquired 750 tons of new garlic was stored in July. At that time, the purchase price of the new garlic was about 7 cents per catty.
Garlic exporters said that the current wholesale price of garlic and storage costs of 7.5 yuan per kilogram can not pay the cost. It is expected that the price of garlic will still rise for a while, but if the garlic is not fast enough to be ingested before next year, , it may cause the price of garlic to fall. At present, both buyers and sellers are on the sidelines.
Lu Media reported that at the Xinfadi Agricultural Products Wholesale Market in Beijing, the garlic trading area last weekend was a bit deserted, with only a few people scattered around to buy garlic. Zhang Peng, the garlic distributor of the wholesale market, said: ""A car sells for seven or eight days, eight or nine days, and now sales are still half slower than the original.""
There are other reasons for the high price of garlic. According to industry analysts, the excessive amount of garlic in the previous two years caused the price of garlic to plummet last year, and the garlic farmers abandoned it a lot. This caused the price to rise sharply this year, and the export volume of some areas and the export volume surged. Leading to domestic prices rising all the way.
According to the statistics of the international garlic trade network, China's garlic planting area is about 6 million mu, and the area of planting this year is about 33% to 35% less, of which about 25% is reduced in the main producing areas.
In May, Lu Media reported that the purchase price of new garlic this year was three or four times higher than last year. Industry insiders said that garlic prices still have room to rise.

In addition to the rise in garlic, all the prices of Chinese folks have skyrocketed, and the prices of pork, eggs, and fruits have soared to the general public.
Pork is one of the people's favorite foods and the barometer and weather vane of the people's livelihood make its importance self-evident.
Now the average selling price of pork on the mainland market has reached 40 yuan a pound. As early as a few months ago, some people bluntly refused to eat pork. Many people chose meat such as chicken, duck, fish, sheep and cattle to replace pork, but the prices of meat such as chicken, duck, fish, sheep and cattle also rose.
Some netizens lamented: ""Now everything is raising prices, only wages are not rising, how can the people's days pass!"" ""Not just can't afford pork, other meat, eggs, garlic can't afford it, change to eat onions. Replaced.""
