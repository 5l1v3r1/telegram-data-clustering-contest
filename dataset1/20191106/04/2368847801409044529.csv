大陸颳起姓黨風 民企：有點像「私生子」

06 Nov 2019, 04:20

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】近年來，中共加強對民營企業的控制，促使私營企業紛紛加強所謂的「黨建設」。對此，有自媒體說，目前，中國颳起「姓黨」風，各行各業競相認中共為「爸爸」，民企也自稱姓黨有點像「私生子」。
中國經濟的重要支柱民企遭遇寒冬。剛剛結束的中共四中全會明言「以公有制為主體」，意味著國企為主，私企為輔。分析指這是在走回頭路。
法廣引述學者分析認為，顯然這是退回到中共12大的路線，形同對鄧小平改革開放路線的否定，無助於穩定民營企業家。
報導說，中國民營經濟貢獻了50%以上的稅收，60%以上的GDP，70%以上的技術創新，80%以上的城鎮勞動就業。但中共一直重國企輕私企，去年一波私有經濟退場論，更讓民營企業不寒而慄。
面對嚴峻的經濟形勢，去年11月1日，習近平出面召開民營企業座談會，安撫「民營企業和民營企業家是我們自己人。」一年過去了，許多民營企業家總覺得「政府沒有把他們當自家人」，民營企業家信心不足，企業陷於困境。
中央社報導，在強調「政治學習」要求下，許多民企還被迫投入非生產活動，影響經營效率。
中共《人民日報》發表的題為「中國的民營企業為什麼要加強黨建設？」一文中公布的數據，截至去年年底，全中國已有158.5萬家非公有制企業法人單位設立了黨組織。
自媒體「LIFETIME視界」發推文認為，中國颳起「姓黨」風，向社會傳遞的導向有3點：
1是，一般中國人跟誰姓是明確父子（母子）關係表達。姓黨爭著做中共的兒子？2是，一般中國人的姓氏表明一種血緣關係，媒體姓黨、公安姓黨還好理解，但民企自稱姓黨有點像「私生子」。3是，中國各行各業競相認中共為「爸爸」，那些沒認中共「爸爸的機構、企業就成另類了。
網友紛紛跟貼熱議：「這算是人人自危，開始爭相表態，害怕哪天被黨清算」、「以為認乾爹就可以避免被割韭菜，但事實證明，大量私企已經被割韭菜」。

過去一年多來，隨著中美貿易戰升級、中國經濟不斷下滑，中國民營企業陷入了前所未有的困境之中，許多民企在走投無路之下，只能「投靠」國企。
然而，中共打著「黨領導」的旗號，刻意推動國有資本「做強、做優、做大」，新一輪「國進民退」似乎已經開始。
9月以來，中共官方對高科技為首的民營企業動作不斷，從入戶清查到派駐官員，民營企業從政治和經濟上都被徹底管死。
外界認為，中國民營經濟和民營企業家們的命運，早已被中共控制，中共體制決定了私營經濟只是國有經濟的補充，在中共一步步的收緊下，正在被黨、政府和權貴加速吞噬。
日前，曾任全國工商聯農產商會代表的蔡曉鵬，在 「2019秋季新莫干山閉門研討會」上，直截了當地表示，民營企業過得不好，「經濟整治運動化」已經搞七、八年了。有的數據統計，一輪一輪不停的運動式折騰，波及了1000多萬個經濟實體，10多萬億的損失。
還有國企和政府賴了民營企業10多萬億的帳硬是不還。民營企業你覺得過得好嗎？我覺得過得不好。我有兩個群有2000多個民營企業家，沒有一個說好的……
蔡曉鵬說：「企業為什麼恐慌啊，公權太任性了！或縱容、鼓勵或約束不住！近兩年，中央發了不少文件，涉民企財產保護的，沒有一條真落實的。甚至沒有頒布追責公權濫用的法定程序。」
他質問：中國有沒有建立起讓民營企業家免予恐懼的權利的這種制度環境？沒有。我們講產權平等，我查了一下，講到現在為止都是有政策沒有法律，沒有法律就沒有對公權濫用的問責。
所以在北京發生那麼多的大規模拆遷，沒什麼賠償，逼死了那麼多人，沒人問！都不敢也不讓報導出來。而涉及無數平民百姓私權保護與公權任性的衝突，既沒有行政法律糾錯機制，也沒有行政法律糾錯平台。
根據中共國家統計局公布地數據，中國第三季度GDP同比增長6%，是近30年來季度GDP最低值。但中國人民大學經濟學教授向松祚，質疑這一數據仍然明顯高估。
他認為民營企業家信心不足，是中國經濟加速下行的關鍵原因，尤其是製造業投資急劇下降。去年各種噪音造成民營企業家信心嚴重受挫，至今也沒有回覆，企業家信心不足時經濟加速下行的關鍵原因。
向松祚說，民營企業家普遍缺乏安全感，沒有長期投資打算。如何讓民營企業家安心，順心，放心，願意長期投資，不想移民，不想轉移資產，就必須要從法治制度上真正妥善保障私有權。

The mainland is blowing up the name of the party. Private enterprises: a bit like ""illegitimate children.""

06 Nov 2019, 04:20

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] In recent years, the CCP has strengthened its control over private enterprises, prompting private enterprises to strengthen the so-called ""party building."" In this regard, some media said that at present, China has a ""name of the party"" style, and all walks of life compete to recognize the CCP as ""dad"". Private enterprises also claim that the surname party is a bit like ""illegitimate son.""
The important pillar of the Chinese economy is a cold winter. The just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party clearly stated that ""public ownership is the mainstay"" means that state-owned enterprises are the mainstay and private enterprises are the supplement. Analysis means that this is going back.
According to scholars' analysis, it is clear that this is a route back to the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It is a negation of Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up line and does not help stabilize private entrepreneurs.
The report said that China's private economy contributed more than 50% of tax revenue, more than 60% of GDP, more than 70% of technological innovation, and more than 80% of urban labor employment. However, the CCP has always been a state-owned enterprise and a private enterprise. Last year, a wave of private economy exited the school, which made private enterprises shudder.
Facing the severe economic situation, on November 1, last year, Xi Jinping convened a private enterprise symposium to appease that ""private enterprises and private entrepreneurs are our own people."" One year later, many private entrepreneurs always felt that ""the government did not They are self-employed."" Private entrepreneurs lack confidence and enterprises are in trouble.
The Central News Agency reported that under the emphasis of ""political learning,"" many private enterprises were forced to invest in non-production activities, affecting operational efficiency.
As published in the article published by the People’s Daily of the People’s Daily, “Why should China’s private enterprises strengthen party building?”, as of the end of last year, 1.85 million non-public enterprises in China had established party organizations.
From the media ""LIFETIME Vision"", I believe that China has a ""following the party"" style and has three directions to the society:
1 Yes, the general Chinese with whom the surname is a clear father and son (mother and child) relationship expression. The surname party is vying to be the son of the CCP? 2 Yes, the general Chinese surname indicates a blood relationship. The media surnamed the party and the public security surname party are well understood, but the private enterprise claims that the surname party is a bit like an ""illegitimate child."" 3 Yes, all walks of life in China are competing to recognize the CCP as a ""dad"". Those institutions and enterprises that do not recognize the CCP's ""dad"" become alternatives.
Netizens have been arguing with each other: ""This is everyone's self-defense, and they are beginning to argue with each other, fearing that they will be liquidated by the party one day."" ""I think that you can avoid being cut of leeks, but it turns out that a large number of private companies have been cut. "".""


The CCP has formulated one of the seven key tasks: ""To protect the personal safety and property security of private entrepreneurs."" Many scholars analyzed the true purpose of the CCP. (China Photos/Getty Images)

Over the past year or so, with the escalation of Sino-US trade wars and the continuous decline of China's economy, Chinese private enterprises have fallen into an unprecedented predicament. Many private enterprises can only rely on state-owned enterprises after they have nowhere to go.
However, under the banner of ""party leadership,"" the CCP deliberately promoted state-owned capital to ""strengthen, optimize, and expand."" A new round of ""national advancement and retreat"" seems to have begun.
Since September, the CCP’s officially-run private enterprises, led by high technology, have continued to move from household inspections to resident officials. Private enterprises have been completely killed politically and economically.
The outside world believes that the fate of China's private economy and private entrepreneurs has long been controlled by the CCP. The CCP system has determined that the private economy is only a supplement to the state-owned economy. Under the gradual tightening of the CCP, it is being swallowed up by the party, the government, and the power.
Recently, Cai Xiaopeng, who was once a representative of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce Association of Agricultural Products, said in a ""closed seminar on the new Moganshan in the fall of 2019"", that the private enterprises have a bad life and that the ""economic rectification campaign"" has been done seven or eight. Years. Some statistics show that a round of non-stop sports toss, affecting more than 10 million economic entities, more than 10 trillion losses.
There are also state-owned enterprises and the government relying on more than 10 trillion yuan of private enterprises. Do you think that a private enterprise is doing well? I don't think it's too good. I have two groups with more than 2,000 private entrepreneurs, none of them say good...
Cai Xiaopeng said: ""Why do companies panic, public rights are too self-willed! Or connivance, encouragement or restraint! In the past two years, the central government has issued a lot of documents, and the protection of private enterprise property has not been implemented. Not even promulgated. The statutory procedure for pursuing abuse of public rights.""
He asked: Has China established this institutional environment to give private entrepreneurs the right to be free from fear? No. We talk about equality of property rights. I checked it. It is said that there are policies and no laws so far. Without laws, there is no accountability for the abuse of public rights.
So there have been so many large-scale demolition in Beijing, there is no compensation, so many people are killed, no one asks! Do not dare or let the newspaper export. There are no administrative legal error correction mechanisms or administrative law correction platforms for the conflicts between the protection of the private rights of countless civilians and the will of public rights.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, China's third-quarter GDP grew by 6% year-on-year, the lowest quarterly GDP in the past 30 years. However, Xiang Songzhen, a professor of economics at Renmin University of China, questioned that the data is still significantly overvalued.
He believes that the lack of confidence of private entrepreneurs is a key reason for China's accelerated economic downturn, especially the sharp decline in manufacturing investment. Last year, all kinds of noise caused the confidence of private entrepreneurs to be seriously frustrated. So far, there has been no reply, and the key reason for the accelerated economic downturn when entrepreneurs lack confidence.
Xiang Song said that private entrepreneurs generally lack security and have no long-term investment plans. How to make private entrepreneurs feel at ease, with ease, with confidence, willing to invest for a long time, do not want to emigrate, and do not want to transfer assets, they must truly protect private rights from the rule of law system.
