韓國瑜被爆曾買7千萬豪宅　綠委要韓交代資金來源
06 Nov 2019, 04:21 by 黃揚明, 吳宗哲
標榜「庶民總統」的國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜遭媒體踢爆，曾在2011年無業時，購買總價高達近7,200萬元的台北市南港區「無雙」（後改稱「日升月恆」）豪宅預售屋，並於2015年初小賠售出。民進黨立委林俊憲質疑，韓國瑜與妻子李佳芬閨密買房根本是炒房集團，買房的錢從哪裡來，韓國瑜應要交代清楚。



林俊憲質疑，韓國瑜重用李佳芬閨密高美蘭擔任高雄市府觀光局主祕，她的老公趙東洲也與韓一同買房，「何止閨密，還一起買房炒房！」他也說，凡走過必留下痕跡，凡住過必有鄰居，後續可能還會有更多爆料。
林俊憲強調，該處豪宅建案當時是南港最高價預售屋，一群人一次下訂好幾戶，錢到底怎麼來的？韓國瑜應該要說明清楚，且若涉入炒房，不止不是庶民，要選總統要受到檢驗。
民進黨立委王定宇則透過臉書質疑，韓國瑜買7200萬豪宅讓假庶民現形，且還有財源來路不明的問題。他試算，若韓貸款7成約5,050萬元，按現行房貸利率，本金加利息每月將要負擔約30萬元的房貸，到底錢打哪來？
而根據《聯合新聞網》報導，韓國瑜競選辦公室發言人何庭歡表示，韓國瑜夫婦當年有意到台北發展事業，因此最初在內湖貸款買房，之後又考慮到家中3個孩子生活空間問題，於是處理掉內湖的房產，再貸款到南港買預售屋，也付了頭期款和利息，但因錯估財務負擔壓力，所以才賠本售出。
何庭歡也強調「庶民就是平民、也就是沒有特權的人，也有買賣房產的權力，這是個人房產。」針對財產申報沒有看到相關消息，何庭歡表示該筆房產是韓國瑜擔任北農總經理前購買、北農總經理任內售出，北農總經理不需申報財產。

South Korea’s Yu was blasted and bought 70 million luxury homes.
06 Nov 2019, 04:21 by Huang Yangming, Wu Zongzhe
The Kuomintang presidential candidate who advertised the ""President of the People's Republic of China"" was kicked out by the media. When he was unemployed in 2011, he bought a total of nearly $72 million in the Nangang District of Taipei City, which was ""unparalleled"" (later renamed ""Sunrise Moon Hengheng"" "") The pre-sale house was sold and sold at the beginning of 2015. Lin Junxian, a legislator of the Democratic Progressive Party, questioned that South Korea’s Yu and his wife, Li Jiafen’s purchase of a house, were all real estate speculators. Where the money for buying a house came from, South Korea’s Yu should be accountable.



Lin Junxian questioned that South Korea’s Yu used Li Jiafen and Mi Gaolan as the chief secret of the Kaohsiung City Tourism Bureau. Her husband Zhao Dongzhou also bought a house with Han. “It’s more meticulous, and I also buy a house with real estate!” He also said, go If there is a neighbor, there will be more neighbors.
Lin Junxian stressed that the high-rise pre-sale house in Nangang was built at the time. The group of people booked several households at a time. How did the money come from? South Korea's Yu should be clearly stated, and if it is involved in real estate speculation, it is not just a public. The president must be tested.
Wang Dingyu, the legislator of the DPP, questioned through Facebook that South Korea’s Yu bought 72 million luxury homes to make fake people appear, and there was still an unclear source of financial resources. He tried to calculate that if the Korean loan 70% is about 50.5 million yuan, according to the current mortgage interest rate, the principal plus interest will have to pay about 300,000 yuan monthly mortgage. Where is the money?
According to the ""Joint News Network"" report, He Tinghuan, a spokesman for the Korea Yoga Campaign Office, said that the Korean Yu couple had intentionally went to Taipei to develop their careers. Therefore, they initially bought a house in Inner Lake and then considered the living space of three children in the family. The property in Neihu was re-loaned to Nangang to buy pre-sale houses, and the first payment and interest were paid. However, due to the wrong financial burden, it was sold out.
He Tinghuan also stressed that ""the people are civilians, that is, people without privileges, and they have the right to buy and sell real estate. This is a personal property."" No information was found on the property declaration. He Tinghuan said that the property was purchased by South Korea as the general manager of North Agriculture. The general manager of Beinong was sold within the office, and the general manager of Beinong did not need to declare the property.
