After huge success with the Crusaders, the 27-year-old Samu has won the Australian Conference and reached the semi-finals of Super Rugby since joining the Brumbies, and made his Wallabies debut against Ireland in June 2018.
Offering versatility across all three back-row positions, Samu played 958 minutes in his first campaign with the Brumbies, crossing for five tries and making 579 metres from 74 carries.



Having missed out on the Wallabies squad for the Rugby World Cup, Samu will be targeting a return to the international squad.
“I am very excited by the opportunity to extend my current Brumbies contract and commit myself to the Brumbies for the next three years,” he said.
“I feel I have settled in well in Canberra and I have enjoyed every minute of my time here.
“We have a strong bond within our playing group and a lot of quality in every position and I am looking forward to being able to contribute towards the club’s success.”
