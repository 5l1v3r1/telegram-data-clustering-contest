      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 6 — “How did I get chlamydia?” “Is this herpes?”</p>
      <p>People are increasingly turning to strangers on social network Reddit to diagnose their sexually transmitted diseases, according to a new study published in a US journal yesterday that called the phenomenon “crowd-diagnosis”.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the University of California San Diego examined 17,000 posts on a Reddit thread devoted to STDs. They then analysed a random sample of 500 posts.</p>
      <p>Fifty-eight per cent of these messages explicitly requested a crowd-diagnosis, while 31 per cent included a picture of the symptoms.</p>
      <p>One in five such requests come from users trying to get a second opinion, after having consulted a doctor. These included the case of a person who tested positive for HIV, but wanted to know what other Reddit users thought.</p>
      <p>Eight-seven per cent of the time, such requests received a reply, and fast: The median time for a first response was three hours, with some receiving a reply in less than a minute.</p>
      <p>“Everybody talks about Dr Google all the time,” John Ayers, an epidemiologist at UC San Diego and co-author of the paper published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“But the reality is searching for information online is not how people use the internet anymore. They want to get real interactions with real people.”</p>
      <p>But the problem, Ayers added, was that “crowd-diagnosis, as it exists now, is wildly inaccurate and dangerous, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t turn millions of people seeking diagnosis on social media into something good.”</p>
      <p>He and his colleagues envisioned a future in which health care professionals were available on social networks — not necessarily to make a diagnosis based on insufficient information, but to make a first screening and refer users to where they could get help — either at a clinic or via a teleconference consultation.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that in the longer term, the bigger picture is crowd diagnosis could be a boon to public health information,” Ayers said, taking the example of a subreddit devoted to suicidal thoughts.</p>
      <p>“Trained experts are curating that Reddit, and they provide them referrals,” he added. — AFP</p>
