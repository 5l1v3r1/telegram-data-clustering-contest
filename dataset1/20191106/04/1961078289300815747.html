      <h1>Shelly Simonds, Who Lost Random Draw in 2017 Race, Wins Handily in Virginia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T04:34:53+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 04:34</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Victor</a></address>
      <p>Her 2017 run for the Virginia House of Delegates ended in heartbreak, with her losing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/virginia-tie.html?module=inline">random-chance draw out of a bowl</a> after she tied her opponent with 11,607 votes apiece.</p>
      <p>This time, there was little drama for Shelly Simonds.</p>
      <p>Ms. Simonds, a Democrat, handily won her seat in Virginia’s 94th District on Tuesday, flipping the seat of David Yancey, the Republican incumbent whose name was chosen out of the bowl, by a tally of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/05/us/elections/results-virginia-general-elections.html?module=inline">58 percent to 40 percent</a>. Her victory contributed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html?module=inline">a major Democratic shift in Virginia</a>, with the party winning majorities of both chambers of the legislature to support the Democratic governor.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to have some change in Newport News, that’s for sure,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WTKR3/videos/504472100104582/">she told supporters Tuesday night</a>. “I think we’re going to have change in Richmond, too.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Simonds, a Newport News school board member, found herself at the center of an unexpectedly dramatic race in 2017, which made national headlines for both its spectacle and its political significance.</p>
      <p>To many, it was a cautionary tale on why every vote counts. At one point, Ms. Simonds seemed to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/virginia-house-of-delegates-single-vote.html?module=inline">won by one vote</a> after a recount, but the victory lasted just one day before a three-judge recount court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/us/virginia-house-election-tie.html?module=inline">added a vote for Mr. Yancey</a>, putting them at a tie again.</p>
      <p>The election was settled when each candidate’s name was written on strips of paper and placed in old 35-millimeter film canisters that were put inside a bowl. After the canisters were mixed together, an official of the Virginia State Board of Elections pulled one out, and Mr. Yancey’s name was revealed to a throng of cameras.</p>
      <p>The tension was heightened by the enormous stakes. A victory for Ms. Simonds would have delivered Democrats an end to 17 years of Republican control by deadlocking the House at 50-50. Instead, Republicans maintained their edge with a 51-to-49 advantage.</p>
      <p>Democrats were aided this time by a court-ordered remapping of voting districts, tilting the 94th District toward Democrats. In June, the United States Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/us/politics/virginia-racial-gerrymandering-supreme-court.html?module=inline">upheld a lower court decision</a> that struck down parts of the map on race-discrimination grounds, and the maps were redrawn to more evenly distribute black voters.</p>
