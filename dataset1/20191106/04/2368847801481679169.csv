習「高度信任」林鄭？學者：下台前的安慰

06 Nov 2019, 04:14

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】習近平日前在上海與香港特首林鄭月娥會面，並對其表示「高度信任」，引發外界諸多解讀。有學者認為，北京對林鄭的信任僅是「暫時性」，不代表北京喜歡或肯定林鄭的表現，很可能僅是「下台前的安慰」。
香港反送中運動已持續6個月，香港民怨沸騰，林鄭已經成為香港歷來民意支持率最低的特首。然而，在一片「下台」呼聲中的林鄭，11月4日在上海向習近平匯報工作時，卻得到習的當面肯定。
習近平表示對林鄭「高度信任」，並指示林鄭目前最重要的任務是「止暴制亂」。外界擔心，習近平的表態意味著當局將繼續對香港抗議活動進行高壓政策，港人的五大訴求恐更難獲得回應。
林鄭5日即公開表示，不會特赦被捕及將被起訴的示威者。
不過，多位學者分析，林鄭對香港亂局負有不可推卸的責任，雖然北京當局表示支持林鄭，但並不代表林鄭未來不會被問責。
香港中文大學中國研究中心客座教授林和立表示，北京對林鄭的支持僅是「暫時性」，不代表北京喜歡或高度肯定林鄭的表現。林鄭過去幾個月的表現大家有目共睹，很多觀察家都認為，中央已經對林鄭失去信心，她已經成為一隻跛腳鴨。
林和立對德國之聲說，無論如何林鄭下台的命運已經不可能改變了，無論是明年三月，人大解除她的職務，還是讓她再留任一年。在她卸任之前，習近平只能對她表示支持。
他強調，但這並不意味著中央對她工作的肯定，否則也不會有那麼多關於她即將下台、由中央物色合適人選接替她的傳言。
獨立評論人協會召集人、浸大新聞系高級講師呂秉權對港媒分析稱，中共暫時不會讓林鄭下台，是因為還需要林鄭「用盡剩餘日子，做dirty job（幹髒活兒）」。
前新加坡「海峽時報」駐中國首席特派員程翔也認為，習近平見林鄭不一定代表不會撤換林鄭，因為官方通稿並未指稱習支持林鄭繼續執政，肯定其過往工作可能只是「下台前的安慰」。
香港蘋果新聞網則引述時事評論員劉銳紹分析指出，習近平雖然表示對林鄭「高度信任」，卻沒有像過去那樣稱「堅定支持」，只要權力來源有需要犧牲時，林鄭仍會被問責下台。
劉銳紹表示，當局為平息眾怒，甚至可能對香港警方的中下層人員問責。他勸說香港的「執行者」們，「不要以為執行上方政策，就有尚方寶劍免責。」
對於習近平表態支持林鄭，香港「公民黨」立法會議員毛孟靜表示，北京目前只能繼續支持林鄭，期盼風波漸緩。
「民主黨」議員黃碧雲則直言，北京「盲目支持」林鄭只會令更多港人不滿；要解決香港困局，就必須有官員問責下台，林鄭尤其難辭其咎。
林和立分析，從目前形勢來看，中央對香港的全面管控會變得更嚴，中共四中全會公報已經明確表示，香港要扮演捍衛國家安全的角色，23條立法會再次被提上議事日程，也有可能會在一年之內頒布國家安全法。
他表示，北京的立場和香港示威者的訴求是背道而馳的，今後一段時間內，香港的抗爭可能會進一步升級。
外界注意到，在習近平與林鄭會面時，中共公安部部長趙克志也陪同在一旁。有消息指趙克志正式加入成為港澳工作協調小組第5名副組長，顯示公安系統在涉港澳事務上將扮演更重要的角色。而中共軍警混入香港已成為公開的秘密，在社交媒體上頻頻爆出「港警」說「普通話」的視頻。

Learning ""high trust"" Lin Zheng? Scholar: Consolation before stepping down

06 Nov 2019, 04:14

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Xi Jinping recently met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue in Shanghai and expressed ""high trust"", which triggered many interpretations. Some scholars believe that Beijing's trust in Lin Zheng is only ""temporary"". It does not mean that Beijing likes or affirms Lin Zheng's performance. It is likely to be only ""comfort before coming down.""
The Hong Kong Anti-Send Campaign has been going on for six months. Hong Kong people’s resentment has been boiling. Lin Zheng has become the chief executive with the lowest public opinion support rate in Hong Kong. However, Lin Zheng, who was in the midst of a ""departure"" call, was given a face-to-face affirmation when he reported to Xi Jinping in Shanghai on November 4.
Xi Jinping said that he ""highly trusts"" Lin Zheng and instructs Lin Zheng that his most important task at present is to ""stop the storm."" The outside world is worried that Xi Jinping’s statement means that the authorities will continue to exert a high-pressure policy on protests in Hong Kong. It is even more difficult for Hong Kong people to respond to the five major demands.
Lin Zheng publicly stated on the 5th that he would not specifically arrest the demonstrators who will be arrested and will be prosecuted.
However, many scholars have analyzed that Lin Zheng has an unshirkable responsibility for the chaos in Hong Kong. Although the Beijing authorities have expressed support for Lin Zheng, it does not mean that Lin Zheng will not be held accountable in the future.
Lin Heli, a visiting professor at the Chinese Studies Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that Beijing's support for Lin Zheng is only ""temporary"" and does not mean that Beijing likes or highly affirms Lin Zheng's performance. The performance of Lin Zheng in the past few months is obvious to all. Many observers believe that the Central Committee has lost confidence in Lin Zheng. She has become a lame duck.
Lin Heli said to the voice of Germany that the fate of Lin Zheng’s stepping down can no longer be changed anyway. Whether it is March next year, the National People’s Congress will lift her position, or let her stay for another year. Before she left office, Xi Jinping could only support her.
He stressed that this does not mean that the central government is affirming her work. Otherwise, there will not be so many rumors that she is about to step down and that the central government will find a suitable person to succeed her.
Lv Bingquan, a convener of the Independent Critics Association and senior lecturer of the Baptist Department of Journalism, said to the Hong Kong media that the CCP will not let Lin Zheng step down because it is necessary to ""use the rest of the days to do dirty jobs."" "".""
Cheng Xiang, the former chief correspondent of Singapore's Straits Times in China, also believes that Xi Jinping's visit to Lin Zheng does not necessarily mean that Lin Zheng will not be replaced because the official manuscript does not refer to the support of Lin Zheng to continue to govern, affirming that his past work may be just ""removing."" Consolation before.""
Hong Kong's Apple News Network quoted current affairs commentator Liu Ruishao as saying that although Xi Jinping expressed ""high trust"" to Lin Zheng, he did not call ""firm support"" as in the past. As long as the source of power needs to be sacrificed, Lin Zheng will still be held accountable. Step down.
Liu Ruishao said that the authorities are even more angered by the public and may even be accountable to the middle and lower levels of the Hong Kong police. He persuaded the ""executors"" of Hong Kong, ""Don't think that the implementation of the above policy, there is still a sword to be excused.""
For Xi Jinping's support for Lin Zheng, Hong Kong's ""Citizens Party"" Legislative Council member Mao Mengjing said that Beijing can only continue to support Lin Zheng, and hopes that the storm will gradually slow down.
""Democratic Party"" member Huang Biyun bluntly said that Beijing's ""blind support"" Lin Zheng will only make more people in Hong Kong dissatisfied; to solve the dilemma in Hong Kong, officials must be held accountable to step down. Lin Zheng is particularly difficult to blame.
Lin Heli analyzed that from the current situation, the central government’s overall control over Hong Kong will become stricter. The communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party has clearly stated that Hong Kong must play the role of defending national security, and 23 Legislative Councils are once again put on the agenda. On the agenda, it is also possible to enact national security laws within one year.
He said that Beijing's position and the demands of Hong Kong demonstrators are contrary to each other. In the future, Hong Kong's resistance may be further escalated.
The outside world noticed that when Xi Jinping met with Lin Zheng, Zhao Kezhi, the head of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, was also accompanied. It is reported that Zhao Kezhi officially joined the fifth deputy head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Coordination Group, indicating that the public security system will play a more important role in Hong Kong and Macao affairs. The mixing of the Chinese military and police into Hong Kong has become an open secret. The video of ""Hong Kong Police"" saying ""Mandarin"" has frequently appeared on social media.
