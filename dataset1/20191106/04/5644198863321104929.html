      <p>In one incident, the test vehicle struck a bent bicycle lane bollard that partially occupied the test vehicleâ€™s lane of travel. In another incident, the operator took control to avoid a rapidly approaching oncoming vehicle that entered its lane of travel. The vehicle operator steered away and struck a parked car. The NTSB will hold a probable cause hearing on the crash Nov. 19.</p>
