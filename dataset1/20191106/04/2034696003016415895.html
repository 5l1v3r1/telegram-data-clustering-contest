        <b>The Matt Reeves-directed superhero movie is quickly taking shape</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matt Reeves’ upcoming superhero movie, <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/the-batman-movie-release-date-plot-cast-robert-pattinson-2559244"><i>The Batman</i></a>, is reportedly eyeing Colin Farrell and Andy Serkis for the roles of The Penguin and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/colin-farrell-the-penguin-batman-movie-cast-1202766532/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, Farrell is currently in negotiations with Warner Bros. to portray the supervillain. If confirmed, the Irish-born actor will join the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/paul-dano-riddler-new-batman-movie-2558387">Paul Dano’s The Riddler</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/zoe-kravitz-cast-catwoman-opposite-robert-pattinson-batman-2557143">Zoë Kravitz’s Catwoman</a> against <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/robert-pattinson-reportedly-confirmed-new-batman-2503559">Robert Pattinson, who will star as the Caped Crusader</a>. It will also mark the actor’s first return to comic-book films since playing Bullseye in 2003’s <i>Daredevil</i>.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/andy-serkis-alfred-pennyworth-batman/"><i>The Wrap</i></a> reported that Andy Serkis is also in talks to join the line-up as Bruce Wayne’s right-hand man and butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Serkis will be the seventh actor to play Pennyworth on the big screen, following Jeremy Irons in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/reviews-various-artists-16431"><i>Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice</i></a> and Michael Caine in <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/the-movies-blog/the-dark-knight-greatest-trilogy-ever-778725">Christopher Nolan’s <i>The Dark Knight</i> trilogy</a>.</p>
      <p>Serkis and Reeves had also previously worked together in the <i>Planet Of The Apes</i> reboot series, starring in 2014’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/reviews-various-artists-15440"><i>Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes</i></a> and 2017’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><i>War For The Planet Of The Apes</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Jeffrey Wright, on the other hand, was recently confirmed to play Batman ally Commissioner Gordon.</p>

      <p>In September, Pattinson revealed that the new movie <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/robert-pattinson-teases-interesting-direction-for-new-batman-movie-2544745">will take Bruce Wayne in an “interesting direction”</a>. “I really like [director] Matt Reeves and his setup for it,” he told <i>Variety</i>. “It’s an interesting direction. It’s something from the comics which hasn’t really been explored yet. It’s crazy shoes to fill.”</p>
      <p>The actor also said <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/robert-pattinson-being-cast-batman-do-not-understand-2553510">that it was “kind of insane” that he was cast as the iconic superhero</a>. “I was so far away from ever thinking it was a realistic prospect. I literally do not understand how I’ve got it, at all,” Pattinson said.</p>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> is due out in theatres June 15, 2021.</p>
