淮南王一心求道 得遇「八公」登仙界

06 Nov 2019, 04:54

成語「一人得道，雞犬升天」本意是一個人得道成仙，家裡的雞和狗也都沾了仙氣隨之升天，至於後世負面的引申義完全曲解了原意。關於這個成語的來源說法很多，其中之一是與漢武帝時期的淮南王劉安有關。
劉安的父親是淮南厲王劉長，爺爺是漢高祖劉邦。漢文帝時，劉長被告發動叛亂而被流放，在途中絕食而死。漢文帝十分難過，就將他的領地一分為三，分別封給他的三個兒子，長子劉安還繼承了爵位，是為新的淮南王。
與一些喜歡聲色犬馬的王公貴族不同，劉安潔身自好、禮賢下士，他的門下有幾千名頗有才學的門客。他還喜歡研究儒學、算卦和修道的方法，並寫了不少相關的文章。
雄才大略的武帝見劉安博學多才能言善辯，論輩份又是他的叔父，就對他十分敬重。有時還召劉安上朝一起潤色詔書的內容或商討如何給大臣寫回覆，有時在宴席上聽劉安講施政得失，或聽其朗讀新作的賦、頌等。一次，武帝讓他寫一篇解釋屈原《離騷》的文章，早上接到皇命，一頓飯時間他就寫好了。其才思敏捷由此可見。
因為喜歡修道，劉安一直在蒐集天下論述修道方面的書籍，尋找得道之人，哪怕遠在千里之外，也會派人拿著信和資財恭敬地請來。劉安求道的名聲因此也遠播在外。
一天，有八位鬚眉皓白的老者來見劉安。門人先是祕密通報劉安，劉安就讓門人去試探一下他們的能力。門人出來對老者說：「我們淮南王求的是上中下三種賢人。上等賢人要懂得延年益壽長生不老的道術，中等賢人要上知天文下知地理並精通儒家學問的大學問家，下等賢人要十分英武、力能扛鼎、打虎擒豹的勇士。看八位老先生年紀這樣大，好像沒有什麼長生之術，也沒有多大的力氣，也不會對伏羲、神農、黃帝所著的《三墳》和少昊、顓頊、高辛、堯、舜所著的《五典》，以及《八索》、《九丘》這些古代經典有什麼深刻的研究和見解。上面說的三種才能你們都不具備，我可不敢向淮南王通報你們求見的事。」
八位老者笑著說，「我們聽說淮南王特別尊重賢德的人，像周公似的為了接待客人『一沐三握髮，一飯三吐哺』，所以凡是有一技之長的人都來投奔淮南王。我們雖然年老才疏學淺，不合乎淮南王的要求，但我們從很遠的地方來投奔他，希望為他效力。我們想見一見淮南王，就算對他沒有什麼好處，也不會對他有任何不利，為什麼嫌我們老而不見我們呢？如果淮南王認為年輕的人才有學問懂得道術、老年人都是昏庸無用之輩，這可是缺乏開掘頑石尋找美玉、潛入深潭尋找明珠的決心和誠意了。」
老者們接著說「不是嫌我們老嗎？那我們就變年輕些吧」。隨著話音，八個老人都變成了十四五歲的童子，頭髮漆黑，面容像桃花般紅潤。
門人大驚失色，趕忙跑著去通報劉安。劉安聽說後，連鞋都沒來得及穿，就光著腳出來迎接。劉安將八位老者迎到思仙台上，非常隆重地以弟子之禮給老者們叩頭，訴說自己的求道之心，誠摯懇求他們傳給自己修道之法。
八位老者又從童子變回原來模樣。他們告訴劉安，他們的道術也很淺薄，只是比他先行了一步。因為聽說劉安喜愛道術，樂意招納賢士，所以來到這裡。他們告訴劉安，他想學習什麼，他們就教給他什麼。
這八個人中，有人可以呼風喚雨、噴雲吐霧，在地上劃一下就能產生江河，把土聚起來就可堆成高山。有人能讓高山崩塌，讓泉水變成平地，可以馴服虎豹，召來蛟龍，驅使鬼神為自己效力。有人能夠分身，改變相貌，坐在那裡可以馬上消失，可以使千軍萬馬立刻隱去不見，將白天變成黑夜。有人能騰雲駕霧，飛越江河湖海，隨意遨遊在天地任何地方，呼吸之間便能到千里之外。有人可以水火不侵，任何兵器不能傷害，冬天不怕凍，夏天日晒不出汗。有人能千變萬化，恣意所為，禽獸草木，萬物立成，可以讓山河挪動，讓宮殿居屋離開原地。有人能把泥土熬成金子，把鉛水凝煉成銀子，用水把雲母硝石等八種石料煉成仙丹，能讓飛起的水花變成珍珠，能騎著龍駕著雲在九重天上遨遊。
劉安大喜，從此每日向八公叩拜，用酒肉款待他們，並請他們展示每個人的本領，結果他們都各施法術，千變萬化，沒有一個不靈的。劉安遂跟隨八公修道。八公傳授給劉安《玉丹經》三十六卷，劉安按照經書上所言煉成了仙丹，但還沒來得及服用就出了事。
原來劉安的世子劉遷喜好舞劍，自認為劍法高明，沒有人比得上。一天，他讓劉安的門客郎中雷被與他一起舞劍，雷被失手誤傷了劉遷。劉遷大怒，雷被也很害怕，怕劉遷殺他，就向劉安要求帶兵討伐匈奴來贖罪。劉安聽說後不同意。
雷被很恐懼，就上書給漢武帝說：「根據漢朝的法律，如果諸侯中有人貪圖享樂不去討伐匈奴的，該判死罪，劉安應該被處死。」素來敬重劉安的武帝沒有追究劉安的責任，只是將他的封地削去了兩個縣。
劉安十分惱怒雷被的行為，雷被也害怕劉安殺死他，整日都很擔心。與雷被交好的伍被，也曾因為姦淫謀取私利等行為讓劉安很不滿，但劉安一直隱忍未發。都擔心被劉安殺掉的二人商量後，一起向武帝誣告劉安謀反。武帝就派了管理王室親族事務的宗正帶著公文去查辦。
於是八公就對劉安說：「現在是離去的時候了，這是上天讓你脫離世俗的機會。你如果沒有被誣告這件事，日復一日，是很難脫離塵俗的。」劉安同意了。
八公讓劉安登上高山向神靈祭告，並把金子埋在地中，隨即劉安就白日飛升了。他們當時的人馬足跡還留在山上。
成仙離去前，劉安打算殺掉雷被、伍被，八公勸告說：「不能這做。成仙的人連一隻小蟲都不傷害，何況是人呢。」劉安就沒殺雷被與伍被。八公對劉安說，「凡是做官的人被人誣告，那誣告者應該被處死，所以伍被、雷被也應該死了。」
宗正來到淮南王的領地卻找不到劉安，一打聽，才知道他已成仙，遂回覆漢武帝。武帝聽了，十分悵然。後又查明伍被和雷被是誣告，就殺了他們，正應了八公的預言。
另據劉安的門客左吳的記載，劉安在飛升前曾問八公：「能不能把我的親朋好友都帶到仙界去一趟，再讓他們回來呢？」八公說可以，但不能超過五個人。劉安就帶著他的好友左吳、王眷、傅生等五個人到了仙界的玄洲，去了以後又打發他們回來了。
左吳的文章記述說，劉安還沒到仙界時就遇見了幾位神仙，但由於劉安從小就養尊處優，對遇見的幾位神仙不恭恭敬敬地行禮，言談舉止都不太尊重那幾位神仙，而且說話聲音很大，有時還自稱「寡人」。結果仙伯中地位較高的就把這事奏報給了天帝，說劉安對仙官大不敬，應該把他貶回人間。
好在八公在天帝面前為劉安解釋開脫，才免了劉安大不敬的罪，但仍罰他看管天都城中的廁所三年。三年期滿後，只允許劉安當散仙人，不得在仙界擔任官職，只讓他長生不死而已。
還有傳說，說劉安和八公升天時，吃剩下的仙藥放在院子裡，雞狗吃後也都升了天，所以天上也有雞叫狗咬的聲音。這就是「一人得道，雞犬升天」由來。@*#

Huainan Wang’s heart is seeking for the road

06 Nov 2019, 04:54

The idiom ""one person gets the road, the chicken and the dog ascend to heaven"" is meant to be a person who has become a fairy. The chickens and dogs in the family are also scented with the scent of the heavens. As for the negative extension of the later generations, the original meaning is completely misinterpreted. There are many sources of this idiom, one of which is related to Liu An, the Huainan king of the Han Emperor.
Liu An’s father is Huai Nan’s Li Wang Liu Chang, and his grandfather is Han Gaozu Liu Bang. When Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, Liu Chang was accused of launching a rebellion and was exiled. He died on a hunger strike. The Chinese Emperor was very sad. He divided his territory into three, and sealed his three sons. The eldest son, Liu An, also inherited the title, and was the new Huainan King.
Unlike some of the nobles who like the singularity of the dog, Liu Anjie is a good servant, and he is a clerk of Li Xian. There are thousands of talented visitors under his door. He also likes to study Confucianism, mathematics, and monastic methods, and has written many related articles.
The Wudi, who was a big man, saw Liu Anbo’s many words to be eloquent, and his generation was his uncle, and he was very respectful to him. Sometimes I also call on Liu An to go up to the contents of the slogan or discuss how to write a reply to the minister. Sometimes I listen to Liu An at the banquet to talk about the gains and losses of the administration, or to listen to the new works. Once, Emperor Wu asked him to write an article explaining Qu Yuan's ""Li Sao"". In the morning, he received the Emperor's life and he wrote it at a meal time. Its thinking and agility can be seen.
Because he likes to cultivate the Tao, Liu An has been collecting books on the cultivation of the world, and looking for people who have the right way, even if they are thousands of miles away, they will send people with respectful letters and wealth. The reputation of Liu An’s beggar is therefore far away.
One day, eight old-fashioned men came to see Liu An. The doorman first secretly informed Liu An, and Liu An let the doormen try to test their abilities. The doorman came out and said to the old man: ""We Huainan Wang seeks three kinds of sages. The superior sages must know how to prolong life and live forever. The middle sages must go to the university to know the geography and master Confucianism. If the sages are to be very heroic, able to fight, and fight the tigers and leopards. Look at the age of eight old gentlemen. It seems that there is no such thing as a long-lived technique, and there is not much strength, nor will it be Fuxi, Shennong and Huangdi. The ""Three Tombs"" and the ""Five Codes"" written by Shaolin, Yi, Gaoxin, Yi, and Yi, as well as the profound studies and insights of the ancient classics such as ""Basuo"" and ""Jiuqiu"". I don’t have all three talents. I dare not tell Huainan Wang what you are looking for.""
The eight old people said with a smile, ""We have heard that Huainan Wang especially respects the virtues. Like Zhou Gong, in order to receive the guests, ""One Mu, Three Grips, One Meal, Three Sucks,"" so anyone who has a skill has come to Huainan. Wang. Although we are old and poor, we don’t meet the requirements of Huainan Wang, but we have gone from far away to him and hope to work for him. We want to see Huainan Wang, even if it is not good for him, it will not be him. Any disadvantages, why do we suspect that we are old and do not see us? If Huainan Wang believes that young talents have the knowledge to understand the Tao, the elderly are ignorant and useless, but this is the lack of digs to find the beautiful jade, sneak into the deep pool to find the pearl Determined and sincere.""
The old man went on to say, ""Is it not that we are old? Then we will become younger."" With the voice, the eight old men became 14-year-old boys, with dark hair and a rosy face.
The doorman was shocked and ran to inform Liu An. After Liu An heard about it, even the shoes didn't have time to wear them, and they greeted them barefoot. Liu An greeted the eight old men on the Xianxian stage. He solemnly gave the old people a gimmick with their disciples, telling their own heart, and sincerely asking them to pass on their own methods of cultivation.
The eight old men changed back from the boy's appearance. They told Liu An that their Taoism was also very shallow, but it was a step ahead of him. Because I heard that Liu An loves Taoism and is willing to recruit the Magi, he came here. They told Liu An what he wanted to learn and what they taught him.
Among these eight people, some people can call the wind and rain, spray clouds and spit, and draw a river on the ground to create rivers. When the soil is gathered, it can be piled up into mountains. Some people can make the mountains collapse, let the springs become flat, tamed the tigers and leopards, and call the dragons to drive the ghosts and gods to work for themselves. Someone can be separated, change their appearance, and sit there and disappear immediately. It can make the army and the horse disappear immediately and turn the day into the night. Some people can fly in the clouds, fly over the rivers and lakes, and travel anywhere in the world, and breathe between thousands of miles away. Some people can not invade the water, any weapons can not hurt, winter is not afraid of freezing, summer sun does not sweat. Some people can change things and do what they want. The animals and animals are made of grass and everything, and the mountains and rivers can be moved to let the palace houses leave the place. Some people can turn the soil into gold, condense the lead water into silver, and use water to make eight kinds of stone materials such as mica saltpeter into elixir, which can make the flying water flower become a pearl, and ride the dragon to drive the cloud in the sky.
Liu An was overjoyed. From then on, he bowed to the Eight Dynasties every day, treated them with wine and meat, and asked them to show everyone's skills. As a result, they all cast spells, and they were ever-changing. No one was not working. Liu Anzhen followed the Eighths of the monk. The eight publics were given to Liu An's ""Yu Dan Jing"" thirty-six volumes. Liu An was converted into an elixir according to the scriptures, but he had not had time to take it.
It turns out that Liu An’s son, Liu Qiang, likes to dance swords. He thinks that the sword is so good that no one can match it. One day, he let Liu An’s doorman Lang Lei be danced with him, and Lei was mistakenly injured by Liu Qian. Liu Qian was furious, and Lei was also very scared. He was afraid that Liu moved to kill him. He asked Liu An to take troops to attack the Xiongnu to redeem. Liu An disagreed after hearing about it.
Lei was very scared, and he wrote to the Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty: ""According to the laws of the Han Dynasty, if some of the princes were willing to enjoy the fun of the Huns, Liu An should be executed."" Wu Ze, who has always respected Liu An, did not pursue Liu An. The responsibility was to cut his land to two counties.
Liu An was very angry with Lei’s behavior. Lei was also afraid that Liu An would kill him and he was worried all day. Liu An was dissatisfied with the behavior of Lei, and Liu An was always unhappy. They were all worried that the two men killed by Liu An would discuss with the Emperor Wu to rebel against Liu. Emperor Wu sent a letter to the royal family to manage the royal family to investigate.
So Ba Gong said to Liu An: ""It is time to leave. This is the opportunity for God to get rid of the world. If you have not been accused of this matter, day after day, it is very difficult to get rid of the dust."" agreed.
Ba Gong let Liu An board the mountain to sacred to the gods, and buried the gold in the ground, and then Liu An flew up in the day. Their footsteps were still on the mountain.
Before Cheng Xian left, Liu An planned to kill Lei and Wu, and Ba Gong advised: ""You can't do this. The people who become immortals don't even hurt a bug, let alone people."" Liu An did not kill the mine. Was taken with the army. Ba Gong said to Liu An, ""Whenever an official is accused, the accuser should be executed, so Wu and Lei should be dead.""
Zongzheng came to the territory of Huainan Wang but could not find Liu An. When he inquired, he knew that he had become a fairy, and he returned to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Wudi listened, very upset. Later, it was found that Wu and Lei were accused, and they killed them, and they responded to the prophecy of the Eight Commandments.
According to Liu An’s guest Zuowu’s record, Liu An asked Ba Gong before he was promoted: “Can you bring my friends and family to the fairyland and let them come back?” Ba Gong said yes, but not More than five people. Liu An took his friends Zuo Wu, Wang Hao, Fu Sheng and other five people to Xuanzhou in the fairy world. After they went, they sent them back.
Zuo Wu’s article stated that Liu An had met several gods when he was not in the fairy world, but because Liu An was pampered since he was a child, he did not respect the gods in disrespectful manners, and he did not respect the gods. And he speaks a lot, sometimes calling himself ""the widow."" As a result, the higher status of Xianbo was reported to the Emperor, saying that Liu An was disrespectful to the immortal and should return him to the world.
Fortunately, in the presence of Emperor of Heaven, Liu Gong explained Liu An, excused Liu An’s disrespectful sin, but still sentenced him to take care of the toilet in Tiandu City for three years. After the expiration of the three-year period, Liu An was only allowed to be a fairy, and he was not allowed to hold an official position in Xianjie. He only allowed him to live forever.
There are also legends that Liu An and the eight-litre heaven, the rest of the fairy medicine is placed in the yard, and the chickens and dogs are also raised after eating, so there are also chickens called dogs biting in the sky. This is the origin of ""one person gets the road, the chicken and the dog rise to the sky"". @*#
