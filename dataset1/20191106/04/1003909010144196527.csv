Snowfall warnings out for areas west and south of Calgary: Up to 30 cm expected
06 Nov 2019, 04:30 by Zach Laing, Darren Francey
Wet weather in the form of snow visited southern Alberta Tuesday, with an Environment Canada snowfall warning remaining into the evening for the foothills west and south of Calgary. As much as 30 centimetres of snow was expected in some areas.
Warnings were issued Tuesday morning for the regions of Kananaskis-Canmore, Okotoks-High River and Crowsnest Pass-Waterton Lakes. Although Calgary was expected to miss most of the snow, some did fall in the city and temperatures were predicted to plunge Tuesday night to -13 C.
Most of the foothills snow was expected to taper off Tuesday evening for northern regions, while the rest was expected to fall by Wednesday morning.
With the weather came plenty of collisions. Mounties warned people to avoid travel Tuesday evening on Highway 1 between Bassano and Brooks as icy road conditions gripped the area. At least four vehicles hit the ditch in that stretch, RCMP reported, with one social media user reporting seeing a semi jackknifed west of Brooks.



Another social media user reported 18 cm of snow had fallen in Carstairs between Monday night and 5:30 p.m. Tuesday.
Back in Calgary, police reported a total of 198 accidents between midnight and 8:45 p.m. Tuesday. Of those, Calgary police said there were 15 injury collisions, 145 crashes were non-injury, and another 38 that were deemed to be hit and runs.
Through the rest of the week, the weather is expected to fluctuate with the weather hitting a balmy high of 7 C on Friday, before a sharp turn is taken towards a snowy weekend. And if you’re one of the many who will brave the weather as the Calgary Stampeders take on the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Sunday at McMahon Stadium, you might want to break out your long underwear and wool socks.
Environment Canada predicts a high of -13 C on Sunday with a 60 per cent chance of flurries. That, of course, comes after a Saturday that Environment Canada is saying will hit a high of somewhere between -1 and -8 C with snow expected throughout the day.
