WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he did not expect a possible impeachment trial in the Senate to result in the removal of President Donald Trump.


McConnell does not expect possible Senate impeachment trial to lead to Trump's ousterU.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he did not expect a possible impeachment trial in the Senate to result in the removal of President Donald Trump.

“If it were today, I don’t think there’s any question it would not lead to a removal,” McConnell told reporters, adding that the duration of any Senate impeachment trial would depend on how long senators, several of whom are seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential race, want to take.
He declined to answer repeated questions on the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry, which stems from a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate one of Trump’s domestic political rivals.
If the House approves articles of impeachment against Trump, the trial that would follow would take place in the Senate, which could then vote to remove him.
