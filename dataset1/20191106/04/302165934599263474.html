      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 — Malaysians were defrauded of more than RM410 million through internet and call scams from 2018 until August of this year, Parliament was told today.</p>
      <p>Deputy Home Minister Datuk Mohd Azis Jamman said RM224.7 million was lost through 4,956 cases last year and another RM186.0 million from 3,533 cases between January and August this year.</p>
      <p>Mohd Azis fraudsters used a variety of techniques such as the Cassanova scam, fake loan offers, the so-called Macau scam, and others.</p>
      <p>“From the amount lost in 2019, a total of RM 79,483,843.43 involved Macau scams alone, with 1,612 cases reported,” he said. </p>
      <p>Mohd Aziz was responding Sabak Bernam MP Datuk Mohd Fasiah Mohd Fakeh who asked for the number of online scam cases reported and the resulting losses.</p>
      <p>Mohd Aziz also urged the public to be wary when approached with offers of investment, especially if these were unusually attractive.</p>
      <p>He said the Royal Malaysia Police has invested significant effort in raising awareness but members of the public continue to fall for such tricks.</p>
      <p>The deputy minister that it was not feasible to expect law enforcement to be able to effectively prevent such crimes by itself.</p>
      <p>“Enforcement and the law is there, stern action is also taken, but it still depends on a person’s attitude. </p>
      <p>“We cannot have a system of one house, one policeman, so all I can advise is do not be too gullible with such promises, and refer to the police when there is an element of doubt,” he said.</p>
