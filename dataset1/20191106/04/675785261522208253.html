      <p>A man who plotted an Independence Day bomb attack also threatened the life of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> and his family.Â </p>
      <p>Demetrius Pitts, 50, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, as well as threatening the US president's life.</p>
      <p>The Ohio man faces a likely sentence of 14 years in prison followed by a lifetime of supervised release, officials said in announcing the conviction.</p>
      <p>Pitts was arrested by FBI agents on July 1, 2018, after a series of meetings with an undercover agent and an informant.</p>

      <p>He had discussed plans to set off a bomb at a July 4 celebration in a Cleveland park, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Pitts chose the waterfront park as his target in part because it was near a US Coast Guard station, a US Army Corps of Engineers outpost and a downtown federal office building he also wanted to damage.</p>
      <p>Pitts, a Philadelphia native who had expressed allegiance to al Qaeda, also discussed his intention to travel to his Pennsylvania hometown to conduct reconnaissance for a future truck bomb attack there, the FBI said.</p>

      <p>The defendant previously served time in prison for a 1993 robbery in the Cincinnati area.</p>
      <p>Pitts came under FBI scrutiny on the basis of a tip that led federal investigators to review his social media postings.</p>
      <p>They determined that Pitts was "threatening violence against the United States," the agency said.</p>
      <p>Sentencing is due to take place on February 11 next year.</p>
