（吉隆坡6日讯）首相敦马哈迪表示，多年来，我国的贪污已达到一种几乎成为生活方式的水平，人们预示及宣告现金为王。
“我以前曾经说过，当贪污成为‘台下行动’时，这是对我们国家未来的祸害。但是在过去几年，最高领导人在“台上”公开贪污。其他人也毫不畏惧地效仿。”
他昨日为第11届国际金融罪案与恐怖主义融资会议上发表演词时说：“贪污，从令人厌恶的行为，成为可以接受的行为，不久之后，那些没有参与的人就会被认为是愚蠢的人。它达到一种几乎成为生活方式的水平，人们预示及宣告现金为王。”
马哈迪指出，无论马来西亚引入并实施了多么严格和全面的法规，犯罪分子仍然能够找到解决方法，因此，有必要采取新颖和创新的应对措施。
他说：“尽管我们赞赏在处理当今复杂金融犯罪和恐怖主义融资方面的见识和最新发展，但由于缺乏诚信，总让人有机可乘。”
马哈迪表示，人们希望的是，在2018年大选后成立的新政府将维护善政、廉正，并摆脱贪污和滥权。
他说：“这是前朝政府处事方式的结果。他们无视这些崇高的价值观，结果遭到无法忍受公然滥权和贪污的大马人拒绝。”
首相指出，前朝政府当时公然进行金融犯罪，没有考虑法律和法规。
他说：“情况会变成这样，是因为在捍卫这些法律的最高权力者，违反了这些法律所致。”
他强调：“如果大马人的行为和期望没有朝向透明度和问责制，我们实现‘共同繁荣愿景’的努力将失败。”
首相还表示，尽管法律和治理框架在一个干净、透明和负责任的马来西亚中发挥着重要作用，但它们只能走得这么远。
他指出，它需要在公共和私人领域的正确领导下予以支持，以确保这种强化的廉正文化将成为大马的新规范。他还强调，我国需要重振国际声誉和信誉。
他说：“我们曾经与成长中的亚洲经济体并肩而行。猖獗的贪污和贪婪使我们迷失了方向。这一定不会再次发生。我们的声誉已被削弱和声名狼藉。我们需要重振国际声誉和信誉。”
马哈迪在活动上启动了马来西亚金融情报网络（MyFINet），这是由国家银行发起的新公私合作伙伴关系（PPP），旨在成为鼓励执法机构和金融机构之间共享情报和当前热门问题的平台，以处理对国家的重大威胁。
他表示，监管机构和执法机构之间需要强而有力的合作，以更深层次的合作取得有效成果。
PPP成员包括执法机构，例如大马皇家警察、大马反贪会，大马关税局和大马证券监督委员会以及17个金融机构。

Soon, those who do not participate will be considered Stupid people. It reaches a level that is almost a way of life, and people predict and declare cash as king.""

Mahathir said that what people hope is that the new government established after the 2018 election will safeguard good governance, integrity, and get rid of corruption and abuse of power.
He said: ""This is the result of the way the former government worked. They ignored these lofty values and they were rejected by Malaysians who could not tolerate blatant abuse and corruption.""
The Prime Minister pointed out that the former government had publicly committed financial crimes and did not consider laws and regulations.
He said: ""The situation will become like this because the highest authorities who defend these laws are in violation of these laws.""
He stressed: ""If the behavior and expectations of Malaysians are not oriented towards transparency and accountability, our efforts to achieve the vision of 'common prosperity' will fail.""
The Prime Minister also stated that although the legal and governance framework plays an important role in a clean, transparent and responsible Malaysia, they can only go so far.

He said: ""We have been alongside the growing Asian economy. The corruption and greed have made us lose our way. This will not happen again. Our reputation has been weakened and notorious. We need to revive the international Reputation and credibility.""
Mahathir launched the Malaysian Financial Intelligence Network (MyFINet), a new public-private partnership (PPP) initiated by the National Bank, to encourage sharing of intelligence and current hot issues between law enforcement agencies and financial institutions. Platform to deal with major threats to the country.
He said that there is a need for strong cooperation between regulators and law enforcement agencies to achieve effective results through deeper cooperation.
