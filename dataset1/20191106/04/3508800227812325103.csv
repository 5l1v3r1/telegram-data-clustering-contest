今年第17屆台新藝術獎—視覺藝術獎得主蘇匯宇，長期以錄像媒材探討大眾媒體如何影響我們自身或社會對於慾望的觀看與投射，近年來更能看見他從舊書古籍堆中挖掘出官方大歷史外不同的非主流敘事。此次專訪將圍繞於《超級禁忌》、《唐朝綺麗男（1985，邱剛健）》與《未來的衝擊》等作品，回顧這幾年來他是如何利用錄像藝術去探尋被隱沒、屬於台灣特有的異色歷史？如何用當代手法重新召喚被禁制的身體群像？
成長經驗中的《超級禁忌》
專訪一開始，蘇匯宇從自身成長經驗講起，青春期的他正值戒嚴與解嚴交際，對於「性」、「生殖器」直覺的記憶是害怕，甚至恐懼與罪惡感。譬如小時候如果電影中有比較親熱或裸露的鏡頭，長輩都會叫小孩閉上眼、不要看，又或是國中跟同學一起去租片店偷租LD規格的AV影片、去西門町萬年百貨偷翻色情雜誌，這些偷偷摸摸的經驗都令他記憶猶新。因此在錄像作品《超級禁忌》（2015）中，金士傑飾演的中年男子在戶外偷看黃色書刊後被警察抓走，這個片段可說自然而然就浮現出來，他後來回想才發覺，這些都是國家、媒體、家庭、教育系統對於個人身體與慾望的箝制。
對於「身體」的敏感度，蘇匯宇早有意識，父親蘇新田也是藝術家，會在畫架旁放著《PLAYBOY》等成人雜誌與素描用人體結構書，作品也常有裸露，從小他對裸體或不同身體的表現，並不投以異樣眼光。2012年起，他開始瘋狂蒐集古籍，緣於在做關於電視歷史考察的作品《稍待片刻》（2012）時，發現一本修理映像管電視機的老舊工具書，讓他意識到書籍也是一種大眾媒介，因此能發現近年來他從過去對於電視媒體的關注轉向紙本，而找尋這些舊書的過程，就像重新打開他對於台灣歷史與自己記憶的盒子。

《超級禁忌》即這些年收集色情禁書的成果之一，他笑稱買到成為線上拍賣網站的最大買家，曾被老闆附贈色情VCD光碟回饋。手邊目前累積的色情小書有300多本，這些「珍本」曾羅列在《人生．享受．閱覽室》一作中。他也在書海中發現各時代對於身體與性慾的不同喜好（例如濃密陰毛曾一度流行於色情影像，反觀當代偏好刮掉），甚至發想未來能做一個檔案庫，為這些無法容身於正規圖書館藏系統的刊物覓居。
爺爺書櫃上的《未來的衝擊》
十月才在高雄電影節「高雄拍」單元放映的新作《未來的衝擊》（2019）[1]，取材自未來學大師艾文．托弗勒（Alvin Toffler）70年代轟動全球的同名著作，此書在1970年完成、1972年中譯本即在台發行。蘇匯宇在爺爺的書櫃上翻到這本書，務農的爺爺其實是很看重當下的，讓蘇匯宇困惑為何連他都買了，原來《未來的衝擊》是那時暢銷的大眾科普書，回看70年代的台灣，正值經濟轉型與起飛、第二次現代化過程的巔峰、民主運動萌芽的新階段，大眾普遍開始接受新式西方思潮，對於未來有著進步的想像與嚮往。
此作中，蘇匯宇擷取書中內容，與70年代保存至今的高雄場景做疊合。如此的錯位，是蘇匯宇企圖激發觀眾思考的起點。他認為托弗勒這位未來主義者，是以樂觀角度去思考未來，他相信利用工具、科技可以創造美好未來，書中預言的大數據、智慧型載具、次文化興起都一一成真，但對於資本主義的發展與種族議題也有不夠全面之處。
為何選擇高雄取景，是因為蘇匯宇在勘景時發現，南部都市更新相對沒那麼快，較多硬體設施還保有70、80年代左右的機能主義風格。例如其中一幕場景中出現的欣高石油氣公司，裡頭的鋁門百葉窗窗簾現在已經相當少見。其他出現的場景，還包含1978年開始興建的興達發電廠、1981年完工的果貿社區國民住宅等。

影像中人物呈現出的「美好形象」，蘇匯宇指出就像那時台北市政府出版的公部門寫真書（定位類似現在的《台北畫刊》），書中照片包括當時剛建成的東區國宅、新式建築與中產階級生活，展現出摩登的城市氛圍，這類對未來投射美好形象的圖像，透過國家機器形塑並廣傳。然而蘇匯宇也認為，即使在那樣的年代裡依然可見狂歡的身體，可是弔詭地竟出現在國慶大典這類場合，唯有此時身體才有機會解放。而這樣的身體性展現，與蘇匯宇關於90年代小劇場的另一部作品《屁眼．淫書．速克達》（2017），所參與的「破身影」聯展中的解嚴後、被解放卻破敗的身體性，又有相當大的不同。
錄像與電影裡的《唐朝綺麗男（1985，邱剛健）》
如果要在《未來的衝擊》、《超級禁忌》的70、80年代與《屁眼．淫書．速克達》的90年代之間，找一個接合的身體形象，蘇匯宇選擇了1985年的電影《唐朝綺麗男》。
會與這部邱剛健執導的電影相遇，源於2016年蘇匯宇參與台北市立美術館「舞弄珍藏：召喚/重想/再述的實驗室」的委製，館方請蘇匯宇挑選一件館內典藏進行當代對話，他選了60年代張照堂的經典攝影代表作品並創作了同名錄像《存在與虛無（1962，張照堂）》。後來張老師見蘇匯宇對比較另類、異色的身體表現有所關注，就向他介紹《唐朝綺麗男》這部由他擔任攝影師的電影，這也喚起他小時候看過這部電影的海報的記憶，印象中飾演宋念奴的夏文汐好美好美……。
蘇匯宇看了張老師收藏錄影帶轉成的DVD，他也到國家電影中心找出劇本複印本，對照後發現電影與劇本有頗大差異，很多部分已經寫了卻沒拍出來，可能是受限彼時時空背景下的未竟之業。他猜測邱剛健受義大利Giallo電影影響很深，安排許多含有性隱喻的殺人細節，可能受制風氣或預算而無奈刪減。這促使蘇匯宇想要用當代條件來「補拍」這些被遺忘、被箝制、被誤解或是太超前的部分，也為台灣當下對於多元性別的開放留下印記。

不過蘇匯宇也強調，儘管現階段台灣在處理性別議題或作品上比以往自由，也已經比許多國家開放，但他觀察到大眾媒體報導仍傾向把他的創作放入「大膽前衛、挑戰情慾、突破禁忌」這類試圖造成爭議的框架之內。他表示從不為自己的作品做這樣的設限，會做這樣的呈現單純因為好看，而這類作品在某些國家展出時，媒體並不會這樣操作。
我們身上背著的台灣歷史
近年來能發現蘇匯宇嘗試以電影產製規格進行錄像藝術的創作，這一切都是因緣際會。2013年，蘇匯宇因《稍待片刻》獲邀參加盧森堡電影節，展映地點在當地的當代藝術中心，他開始意識到歐洲已經將電影與錄像放在一起討論。背後涉及的大背景是數位拍攝技術的普及，「過去錄像使用磁帶、電影使用膠卷，現在兩邊都是用Digital（數位）了。原來的分類方式失去合法性。」
2016年鹿特丹影展選片人來台，剛好在國立台灣美術館看到蘇匯宇的作品，力邀參展。蘇匯宇的錄像作品原本都在美術館「白盒子」展出，包括多屏或在特殊裝置內觀看，鹿特丹影展並不介意，要他直接轉換成電影院放映的單屏版本即可。但這個轉換也讓他掙扎一陣，因為得面對轉成電影DCP檔案規格的陌生、後製混音等技術問題。
2017年鹿特丹影展為他規劃導演專題，《超級禁忌》入圍當年金虎獎最佳短片，這次入圍對他的創作生涯帶來頗大助益，因為台灣文化部影視局的「補助入圍（選）或獲國內外重要影展獎項電影片之影視事業及導演製作下一部電影片」專案補助，會針對只要入圍第二類國際影展以上的影像工作者，新的創作計畫所需製作經費做補助。鹿特丹影展即屬第二類國際影展，蘇匯宇的作品被直接認定為「電影片」。同屬政府補助項目，但政府把電影當作產業思考，當代藝術不是，因此電影能拿到更高的金額。拜入圍鹿特丹影展契機與文化部補助機制，蘇匯宇笑稱自己幸運，讓他2016年即有想法的《唐朝綺麗男（邱剛健，1985）》大型拍攝計畫，資金順利到位。

但回過頭來，蘇匯宇也直言從不覺得錄像跟電影是涇渭分明的，因為他認為影像觀看的體驗是一樣的。他自己是靠片（Cult film）影迷，喜歡尤杜洛斯基（Alejandro Jodorowsky）、寺山修司，近期則很欣賞中國導演畢贛。此外，他曾擔任詩人鴻鴻執導電影《空中花園》的第二攝影與美術助理，對電影製作的過程與邏輯稍有掌握。
專訪尾聲，蘇匯宇綜論自身的影像美學，他近年來在老書堆或文件裡找尋台灣歷史中的身體政治、建構出屬於台灣獨有的身體檔案，但他無意建構一個全景式的觀點，而是從個人的成長經驗出發，他認為我們身上都背著台灣歷史，歷史總是不客觀的，這也是為何蘇匯宇的影像世界總是朦朧如夢。因為他認為，回憶歷史的過程就像在作夢，但那不是逃避歷史，而是無法全然寫實。
註釋[1]
除了高雄電影節放映的電影版本，《未來的衝擊》原為三屏幕錄像作品，此作品目前正在空總當代台灣文化場的「城市震盪」展覽（10/5-12/8）展出。

This year's 17th Taiwan New Art Awards - Visual Arts Award winner Su Huiyu, has long used video media to explore how the mass media influences our own or society's viewing and projection of desires. In recent years, I have seen him dig out official books from old books. Different non-mainstream narratives outside history. The interview will focus on ""Super Taboo"", ""Tang Dynasty Yan Li Nan (1985, Qiu Gangjian)"" and ""The Shock of the Future"" and other works. I have reviewed how he has used video art to explore hidden and unique to Taiwan in recent years. The history of different colors? How to re-call the banned body group image in a contemporary way?
Super Taboo in the Growth Experience
At the beginning of the interview, Su Huiyu talked about his own growth experience. During his adolescence, he was engaged in martial law and martial law. His memory of ""sex"" and ""genital"" intuition was fear, even fear and guilt. For example, if a movie has a relatively intimate or bare lens in the movie, the elders will ask the child to close their eyes and not watch it, or go to the rental shop with the classmates to steal the LD-sized AV movies and go to the Ximending Wannian Department Store. Pornographic magazines, these sneaky experiences have made him remember. Therefore, in the video work ""Super Taboo"" (2015), the middle-aged man played by Jin Shijie was taken away by the police after peeking at the yellow books outdoors. This clip can be said to come naturally, and he later found out that these are the countries. , the media, the family, and the education system are clamped down to the individual's body and desire.
Su Huiyu is conscious of the sensitivity of the ""body"". His father Su Xintian is also an artist. He will be placed next to the easel with adult magazines such as ""PLAYBOY"" and human body structure books for sketching. His works are often bare, and he is naked or different from childhood. The performance does not cast a different vision. Since 2012, he has begun to collect ancient books in madness. When he was doing a work on television history, ""A moment to wait"" (2012), he found an old reference book for repairing the image tube TV, which made him realize that books are also A mass media, so it can be found that in recent years he turned his attention to television media from the past to the paper, and the process of finding these old books is like reopening his box of Taiwanese history and his memory.

""Super Taboo"" is one of the results of collecting pornographic banned books in these years. He laughed and said that he bought the biggest buyer of online auction websites and had been given back porn CDs. There are more than 300 books on the handbooks that are currently accumulated. These ""Zhenben"" have been listed in ""Life."" enjoy. The reading room is in one work. He also found in the book sea different preferences for body and sexual desire in various eras (such as thick pubic hair once popular in erotic images, contrary to contemporary preferences), and even thought that in the future can be an archive, for these can not accommodate the formal books The publications of the collection system are inhabited.
The impact of the future on the grandfather's bookcase
In October, the new work ""The Impact of the Future"" (2019) [1], which was screened at the Kaohsiung Film Festival in the Kaohsiung Film Festival, was drawn from the futuristic master Evan. Alvin Toffler made a sensation in the world in the 1970s. The book was completed in 1970 and was published in Taiwan in 1972. Su Huiyu turned to this book on Grandpa's bookcase. The grandfather of farming is actually very concerned about the present, so that Su Huiyu confused why he even bought it. The original ""The Impact of the Future"" was the best-selling popular science book at that time, looking back at the 70s. Taiwan is at the peak of the economic transformation and take-off, the peak of the second modernization process, and the nascent stage of the democratic movement. The public has generally begun to accept the new Western trend of thought, and has progressive imagination and yearning for the future.
In this work, Su Huiyu took the contents of the book and overlapped with the Kaohsiung scene that was preserved in the 1970s. Such a dislocation is the starting point for Su Huiyu's attempt to stimulate the audience's thinking. He believes that the futurist of Tofler is thinking about the future with an optimistic perspective. He believes that tools and technology can create a better future. The big data, smart vehicles and subcultures predicted in the book are all coming true. But there is not enough comprehensiveness about the development of capitalism and ethnic issues.
Why Kaohsiung was chosen because Su Huiyu found that the urban renewal in the south was relatively not so fast, and the more hardware facilities still maintained the functional style of the 70s and 80s. For example, in the case of Xingao Gas and Gas Company, which appeared in one scene, the aluminum door blinds in the curtains are now quite rare. Other scenes that have emerged include the Xingda Power Plant, which was built in 1978, and the National Housing Building, which was completed in 1981.

Su Huiyu pointed out that the characters in the image showed a ""good image"". Su Huiyu pointed out that the Taipei City Government published a public photo book (located in the current ""Taipei Pictorial""). The photos in the book include the Eastern House, which was just built. New architecture and middle-class living show a modern urban atmosphere, and this kind of image that projects a beautiful image of the future is shaped and spread through the national machine. However, Su Huiyu also believes that even in such an era, the carnival body can still be seen, but the condolences appear in such occasions as the National Day ceremony. Only then can the body have a chance to liberate. And this kind of physical expression, with Su Huiyu's other work on the small theater in the 90s, ""Asshole. Kinky book. ""Kekta"" (2017), in the ""Breakthrough"" joint exhibition, the liberated but ruined physicality is quite different.
Video and Movie ""Tang Dynasty Yan Li Nan (1985, Qiu Gangjian)""
If you want to be in the ""Future Impact"", ""Super Taboo"" in the 70s and 80s and ""Asshole."" Kinky book. Between the 90s of the Scooter, looking for a joint body image, Su Huiyu chose the 1985 film ""The Tang Dynasty"".
It will meet with this film directed by Qiu Gangjian. It originated from the participation of Su Huiyu in the Taipei City Museum of Fine Arts in the “Dance Collection: Calling/Rethinking/Retelling Lab” in 2016. The museum asked Su Huiyu to select a collection in the museum. In contemporary dialogue, he chose Zhang Zhaotang's classic photography representative works in the 1960s and created the same-named video ""Existence and Nothing (1962, Zhang Zhaotang)"". Later, when Zhang saw Su Huiyu paying attention to the performance of the alternative and different colors, he introduced him to the film of the Tang Dynasty, which was the photographer's movie. This also evokes the memory of the poster he saw when he was a child. Xia Wenzhao, who plays Song Niannu in the impression, is so beautiful...
Su Huiyu saw the DVD that Teacher Zhang collected from the videotape. He also went to the National Film Center to find a copy of the script. After comparison, he found that the film and the script were quite different. Many parts have been written but not taken, which may be limited. Unfinished business in the context of time and space. He speculated that Qiu Gangjian was deeply influenced by the Italian Giallo film, and arranged many killing details containing sexual metaphors, which may be restrained by budget or budget. This prompted Su Huiyu to use the contemporary conditions to ""reproduce"" these forgotten, clamped, misunderstood or too advanced parts, and also left a mark on Taiwan's current openness to multiple genders.

However, Su Huiyu also stressed that although Taiwan is now more open than ever in dealing with gender issues or works, it has observed that mass media reports still tend to put his creations into ""daring avant-garde, challenging lust, breakthrough."" Taboos are within the framework of attempts to create controversy. He said that he would never make such a limit for his work. He would do this kind of presentation simply because it looks good. When such works are exhibited in some countries, the media will not do this.
The history of Taiwan on our back
In recent years, it has been found that Su Huiyu tried to create video art with film production specifications, all of which are due to the occasion. In 2013, Su Huiyu was invited to participate in the Luxembourg Film Festival for a short time, and the venue was at the local contemporary art center. He began to realize that Europe had already discussed the film and video together. The big background behind it is the popularity of digital photography. ""In the past, video used tapes and movies used film. Now both sides use Digital. The original classification method loses legitimacy.""
The 2016 Rotterdam Film Festival filmmakers came to Taiwan to see Su Huiyu's works at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts and invited them to participate. Su Huiyu’s video works were originally exhibited in the museum’s “White Box”, including multi-screen or in special installations. The Rotterdam Film Festival did not mind, and he was directly converted into a single-screen version of the cinema screening. But this conversion also made him struggle for a while, because he had to face the technical problems of unfamiliar and post-mixing that turned into the movie DCP file specification.
In 2017, Rotterdam Film Festival planned the director's topic for him. ""Super Taboo"" was selected as the best short film of the Golden Tiger Award of the year. This shortlist was very helpful to his creative career, because the Taiwan Ministry of Culture Film and Television Bureau's ""subsidy finalist (optional) or The film will be awarded by the film and television industry and directors of the film festivals at home and abroad. The project will provide subsidies for the production of new creative projects for video workers who are shortlisted for the second international film festival. The Rotterdam Film Festival is the second international film festival, and Su Huiyu's work is directly recognized as a ""movie film."" It is also a government subsidy program, but the government considers movies as an industry, and contemporary art is not, so movies can get a higher amount. After entering the Rotterdam Film Festival Opportunity and the Ministry of Culture's subsidy mechanism, Su Huiyu said that he was lucky and let him have a large-scale project of ""Tang Chao Li Nan (Qiu Gangjian, 1985)"" in 2016, and the funds were successfully put in place.

But in retrospect, Su Huiyu also bluntly said that the video and the film are very clear, because he thinks the experience of video viewing is the same. He himself is a Cult film fan, like Alejandro Jodorowsky and Sishan Xiu, and recently appreciates Chinese director Bi Wei. In addition, he served as the second photography and art assistant of the poet Hong Hong's film ""The Garden of the Sky"", and had a little grasp of the process and logic of film production.
At the end of the interview, Su Huiyu comprehensively discussed his own image aesthetics. In recent years, he has searched for physical politics in Taiwan history in his old books or documents, and constructed a body file that belongs to Taiwan. However, he did not intend to construct a panoramic view. Starting from personal growth experience, he believes that we all carry Taiwan's history, history is always not objective, which is why Su Huiyu's image world is always a dream. Because he believes that the process of recalling history is like dreaming, but it is not to escape history, but to be completely realistic.
Comment [1]
In addition to the film version of the Kaohsiung Film Festival, ""The Impact of the Future"" was originally a three-screen video project, which is currently on display at the ""City Shock"" exhibition (10/5-12/8) of the Contemporary Taiwan Cultural Field.
