      <h3>Newcastle United transfer admission made</h3>
      <p>James Milner has lifted the lid on how the first attempt from Aston Villa to buy him from Newcastle United collapsed.</p>
      <p>Milner joined <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> in August 2008 for £12 million, two years after his first spell at Villa Park ended.</p>
      <p>The England international moved to Villa Park on loan as part of the deal that saw Nolberto Solano sold to Newcastle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/james-milner">Milner</a> made 27 appearances in his loan stint with David O'Leary's side, scoring one goal in the Premier League.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Gabby Agbonlahor sends Wolverhampton Wanderers message</h3>
      <p>Villa hero <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/gabriel-agbonlahor">Gabby Agbonlahor</a> has added some spice to the upcoming Premier League clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers with a response on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Agbonlahor - who netted 86 goals in 391 appearances across 14 years with Villa - replied to a post on the social media site from Aston Villa's official account.</p>
      <p>It was a clip of Robbie Keane's stunning long-range winner against Wolves back in January 2012, when the former Molineux man scored twice to help Villa to a 3-2 win.</p>
      <p>That was the last Premier League meeting between the two clubs, although Villa triumphed in a Carabao Cup clash last month, while they have faced off in the Championship over recent seasons.</p>

      <h3>Aston Villa fans split over Rangers proposal</h3>
      <p>Villa fans have offered their verdict on whether their club should sign Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> 's side have been heavily linked with a move for the Colombian sensation, who took his tally for the season up to 20 goals from 24 matches on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He netted a brace in Saturday's 5-2 Scottish League Cup defeat of Hearts, the match coming at the end of a week in which speculation about the 23-year-old's future mounted.</p>
      <p>Morelos stated he would be willing to leave Ibrox for what he views as a step up, many interpreting that to be the Premier League with Villa and top flight rivals Leicester City linked with the former HJK Helsinki man.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>John McGinn's brilliant Liverpool verdict</h3>
      <p>Villa's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> reckons his side showed exactly what they were about against Liverpool - and says the performance in the 2-1 defeat at Villa Park is a marked improvement on only a few months ago.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's side were beaten at the death thanks to Sadio Mane's 94th minute winner.</p>
      <p>The Senegal international bundled home Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner in front of the travelling Reds fans, following up Andy Robertson's 87th minute equaliser - a thumping header at the back post.</p>
      <p>While Villa fans will have made their way homes from B6 despondent given their side were in the lead from the 21st minute when Mahmoud Trezeguet volleyed home, McGinn took a more philosophical view.</p>
