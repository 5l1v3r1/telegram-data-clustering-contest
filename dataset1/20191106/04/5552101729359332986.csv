大學時正式出櫃的林祐瑄，畢業後原是個普通上班族，但她察覺自己個性喜與人互動，一度進入高檔法式餐廳工作。2010年，為了開闢財源，林祐瑄決定以自身的消費需求出發，她用6萬元存款找上束胸廠商批貨，在網路上販售女同志用以將胸部束平、降低女性象徵的服飾，並將品牌取名「Heroine專業束胸」，在出租的小套房內，靠著1台電腦在網路上販售束胸，做起兼職生意。

Consumers change their homes


Lin Youzhen, who officially came out of the university, was originally an ordinary office worker after graduation, but she realized that her personality and interaction with people had once entered the work of high-end French restaurants. In 2010, in order to open up financial resources, Lin Youzhen decided to start with his own consumer demand. She used the 60,000 yuan deposit to find the manufacturer of the corset, and sold the lesbians on the Internet to flatten the chest and reduce the female symbol. The brand was named ""Heroine Professional Corset"". In the small suite for rent, a bunch of computers were sold on the Internet by a computer to do part-time business.
The road to entrepreneurship seems to be unintentional, but Lin Youwei is an entrepreneur and a user. She starts with her own wearing experience and understands the lesbian's wearing needs, and further improves the market's existing chest flank, which is too low and stable. Poor degree, non-breathable back material. By relying on MIT to produce locally, the seemingly niche market has successfully sold into chain links such as Carrefour and Baoya, and sold to Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia. Last year, it created a turnover of 10 million yuan.

Using a shell to make a necklace Cambodia's jewelry store


I don't know if all parts of Cambodia have changed in recent years? But Siem Reap is very different.

In this war-torn country, she used the unused brass old shell as the main body to coach young craftsmen into the industry and build their own ideas.
