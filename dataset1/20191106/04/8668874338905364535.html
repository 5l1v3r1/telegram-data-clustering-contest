      <h1>Pete Samu extends contract with Brumbies and Rugby Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T04:56:21+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Wallabies back-rower Pete Samu has signed a two-year extension to his Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies">Brumbies</a> contract.</p>
      <p>Samu, who returned to Australia and joined the Brumbies from the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/crusaders">Crusaders</a> ahead of the 2019 season, has extended his stay with the club until 2022.</p>
      <p>It helps the Canberra-based side consolidate their back-row stocks after the departure of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies/players/david-pocock/">David Pocock</a>, who has headed overseas.</p>

      <p>After huge success with the Crusaders, the 27-year-old Samu has won the Australian Conference and reached the semi-finals of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> since joining the Brumbies, and made his Wallabies debut against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> in June 2018.</p>
      <p>Offering versatility across all three back-row positions, Samu played 958 minutes in his first campaign with the Brumbies, crossing for five tries and making 579 metres from 74 carries.</p>

      <p>Having missed out on the Wallabies squad for the Rugby World Cup, Samu will be targeting a return to the international squad.</p>
      <p>“I am very excited by the opportunity to extend my current Brumbies contract and commit myself to the Brumbies for the next three years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I feel I have settled in well in Canberra and I have enjoyed every minute of my time here.</p>
      <p>“We have a strong bond within our playing group and a lot of quality in every position and I am looking forward to being able to contribute towards the club’s success.”</p>
