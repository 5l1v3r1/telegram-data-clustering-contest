      <p>LONG BEACH, Calif. (KABC) -- Organizers of a Buddhist ceremony held seven days after a mass shooting during a Halloween party in Long Beach said it was to help the spirits of the three killed move on and find peace.<br/><br/>Long Beach police said <a href="https://abc7.com/3-dead-9-wounded-in-shooting-at-long-beach-home/5658005/">nine people were injured by the gunfire on Oct. 29</a> and three were killed.<br/><br/>Among the dead was 25-year-old Maurice Poe Jr.<br/><br/>Poe Jr.'s father, Maurice Poe, was at the ceremony organized by the people who hosted the party.<br/><br/>"He got a 3-year-old girl that don't even know what's going on, but she's experiencing devastation right now," Poe said.<br/><br/>Poe Jr.'s father remembered his son as spontaneous and an aspiring entrepreneur.<br/><br/>Poe organized a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/long-beach-holloween-mass-shooting-funeral-fund">GoFundMe fundraiser</a> for his granddaughter<br/><br/>Poe said he was grateful to the mayor of Long Beach and the city's chief of police for joining to honor his son and the other victims.<br/><br/>"Thank you, but I'd like some results on this case," Poe said.<br/><br/>Chief Robert Luna was also at the ceremony and said the suspect was still outstanding one week later.<br/><br/>"We are working this case like nobody's business," Luna said.<br/><br/>Luna said several casings found at the crime scene led investigators to believe there was more than one firearm.<br/><br/>"We believe there may have been multiple weapons used," Luna said.<br/><br/>Poe said his son and family fell victim to a tragic reality in today's world.<br/><br/>"This is normal in Long Beach. This is normal in Southern California, period," Poe said. "Somebody is feeling like me every day in the Los Angeles County area and that's a sad reality."<br/><br/>Police said they only had a description of the suspect as a male wearing dark clothes with his face concealed during the shooting who may have fled in a dark-colored vehicle.<br/><br/>Anyone with information on the shooting is asked to call Long Beach Police Department Homicide Detail Detectives Mark Mattie or Donald Collier at 562-570-7244 or the department's anonymous tip line 1-800-222-TIPS.</p>
