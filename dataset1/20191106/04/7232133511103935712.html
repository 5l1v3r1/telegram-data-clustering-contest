      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw a nice upward move above the $0.3000 resistance in ripple against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP price traded above the $0.3020 level and formed a new weekly high near $0.3056.</p>
      <p>Later, there was a downside correction below the $0.3020 and $0.3000 support levels. The price even spiked below the $0.2980 support, but the $0.2950 area acted as a strong support. More importantly, the price climbed above $0.2980 and settled above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/05/ripple-xrp-price-climbs-above-0-30-btc-eth-gaining-traction/">100 hourly simple moving average</a>.</p>
      <p>There was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $0.3056 high to $0.2950 low. However, ripple price seems to be facing a couple of key resistances near the $0.3020 level.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there is a key breakout pattern forming with resistance near $0.3010 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The triangle resistance is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $0.3056 high to $0.2950 low.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $0.3020 area is needed for more upsides. The next key resistance area is near the $0.3050 level. A successful close above $0.3050 is likely to push the price towards the $0.3100 and $0.3120 levels.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the $0.2980 area is a strong buy zone and a breakdown area. If there is a downside break below the $0.2980 support, the price could slide again towards the $0.2950 support and the 100 hourly SMA. Any further losses may perhaps push the price towards the $0.2920 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">chart</a>, ripple price is clearly holding a major support near the $0.2980 level. Thus, there are chances of an upside break above the $0.3010 and $0.3020 levels. If not, the price might start another decline towards the $0.2950 and $0.2920 levels.</p>
