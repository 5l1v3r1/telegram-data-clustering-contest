      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Tuesday released testimony by two of the “three amigos” who ran Ukraine policy for President Donald Trump, including revised testimony in which one American diplomat acknowledged U.S. aid was used as leverage to push Kiev to investigate one of Trump’s political rivals.</p>
      <p>Excerpts of closed-door testimony by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland in the impeachment probe of Trump showed Sondland had revised his testimony to say that by September he had come to view a suspension of U.S. security aid to Kiev as being held up as leverage to get Ukraine to commit publicly to a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.</p>
