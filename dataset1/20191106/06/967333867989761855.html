      <p>Voyager 2, the spacecraft launched toward the outskirts of our Solar System decades ago, is still very much alive and kicking, and recently <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201812101070567101-NASAs-Voyager-2-Probe-Departs-Solar-System/">sent home the first message</a> from interstellar space, NASA's researcher Ed Stone told USA Today.</p>
      <p>The data details the ‘cosmic shoreline’, or Heliopause, where the sun’s influence ends and interstellar space – often described as the space between stars – officially begins. NASA research on Voyager data, <a href="https://www.nature.com/natastron/">published</a> as five separate studies in the journal Nature Astronomy, shows that the spacecraft has left the sun's bubble of magnetic fields and particles, far beyond the Oort Cloud.</p>
      <p>The scientists <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201810091068738610-Voyager-2-Soon-Leave-Solar-System/">point out that the boundary of the Solar System</a> is surprisingly precise.</p>
      <blockquote>"In a historical sense, the old idea that the solar wind will just be gradually whittled away as you go further into interstellar space is simply not true," says Don Gurnett, co-author on one of the studies. "We show with Voyager 2 – and previously with Voyager 1 – that there's a distinct boundary out there."</blockquote>
      <p>Voyager’s longevity came as a surprise to NASA scientists.</p>
      <blockquote>“We certainly didn’t know that a spacecraft could live long enough to leave the bubble and enter interstellar space,” Stone said earlier at a press conference, USA Today reports. “We had no good quantitative idea of how big this bubble is."</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201805271064849734-voyager-golden-record-confusing/">Voyager 2 was launched on 20 August 1977</a>, 16 days before Voyager 1. For decades it has travelled toward the distant planets of our Solar System, sending back numerous images and allowing for numerous astronomical discoveries.</p>
