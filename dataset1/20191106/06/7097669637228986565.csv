SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Latest on election races for San Francisco (all times local):
10:25 p.m.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed is claiming victory in Tuesday's election while voters were snubbing out a bid to overturn a city ban on e-cigarette sales.
Breed was ahead of five little-known challengers with some 60 percent of the votes when she declared victory about 90 minutes after the polls closed.
She told a cheering crowd: ""Thank you for honoring me with four more years as mayor!""
Breed has been in office since winning a special election last year following the sudden death of Mayor Ed Lee.
Voters also roundly rejected Proposition C, which was put on the ballot by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. San Francisco-based Juul dumped $12 million into the campaign before halting financial support two months ago.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed appears to be coasting to victory while a proposition to overturn a city ban on e-cigarette sales seems destined for defeat in municipal elections.
Shortly after polls closed Tuesday, Breed was tens of thousands of votes ahead of her five challengers.
Her opponents are little-known and Breed had been expected to handily win her first four-year term.

San Francisco has about 500,000 registered voters.
