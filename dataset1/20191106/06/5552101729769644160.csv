【綠不分區角力】蘇嘉全聲明「不列不分區」　卓榮泰：已瞭解蘇意願
06 Nov 2019, 06:57 by 黃揚明, 鄒保祥, 陳毅偉
立法院長蘇嘉全昨（5日）表示，將於今（6日）午府院黨便當會將向民進黨主席卓榮泰表達他不會也不接受納入不分區立委的立場。民進黨主席卓榮泰今下午受訪時表示，蘇曾一再對外、也對他好幾次表達不要把他考慮在內。
但卓榮泰強調，今天中午的府院黨平台會議蘇嘉全並沒有提起這件事，「他私底下跟我談的」。他說，這個會議不討論黨務工作，黨務工作還是回到黨討論。
卓榮泰指出，這件事情茲事體大，因為還要經過不分區提名委員會共同討論，「我們會瞭解到蘇院長自己的意願，會進行討論，也會很重視。」
至於不分區提名委員會進度，卓榮泰表示，目前已經開過幾次會議，已漸漸進入到個別人選的討論。被問到立委蘇震清是否列入？卓僅說：「個別人選的問題，我們還沒有進一步確認。」


民進黨主席卓榮泰（圖）證實蘇嘉全已私下表達不願擔任不分區立委。

民進黨不分區立委提名作業預計於13日前完成，並提報13日中執會通過提名。由於卓榮泰上週三接受訪問時表示蘇嘉全若留在立法院，也是理所當然，因此外界揣測卓有意以蘇嘉全替代蘇震清，解決蘇震清列入不分區可能引發的爭議。
但蘇嘉全昨晚接受中央社訪問時強調，沒有任何人徵詢他出任不分區立委，而他不會也不接受納入不分區立委，立場堅定從未改變過。今年7月蘇嘉全也曾公開聲明此一立場。

[Green is not divided into corners] Su Jiaquan declares that ""no division or division"" Zhuo Rongtai: I understand the will of Su
06 Nov 2019, 06:57 by Huang Yangming, Zou Baoxiang, Chen Yiwei
The Chief Justice of the Legislative Yuan Su Jiaquan said yesterday (5th) that the party meeting of the Wufuyuan will be expressed today (6th) to the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, Zhuo Rongtai, who will not accept the position of not including the legislator. The DPP chairman, Zhuo Rongtai, said in an interview this afternoon that Su has repeatedly expressed his views to him not to take him into account.
However, Zhuo Rongtai stressed that Su Jiaquan, the party platform meeting of the House of Representatives at noon today, did not mention this matter. ""He talked to me privately."" He said that this meeting does not discuss party affairs, and party work still returns to party discussions.
Zhuo Rongtai pointed out that this matter is very big, because it has to be discussed together by the no-ministerial nominating committee. ""We will understand the wishes of President Su, and will discuss it and attach great importance to it.""
As for the progress of the Nominating Nominating Committee, Zhuo Rongtai said that there have been several meetings and it has gradually entered the discussion of individual candidates. Was asked if the legislator Su Zhenqing was included? Zhuo said only: ""We have not confirmed the issue of individual candidates.""


The chairman of the DPP, Zhuo Rongtai (pictured), confirmed that Su Jiaquan had privately expressed his reluctance to serve as a non-divisional legislator.

The nomination work of the DPP non-district legislator is expected to be completed by the 13th and will be submitted to the 13th Central Committee for nomination. Since Zhuo Rongtai accepted the interview on Wednesday, he said that Su Jiaquan stayed in the Legislative Yuan, which is a matter of course. Therefore, it is speculated that Zhu Jiaqing intends to replace Su Zhenqing with Su Jiaquan and solve the dispute that Su Zhenqing may not be included in the division.
However, when Su Jiaquan was interviewed by the Central News Agency last night, he stressed that no one has consulted him for a non-divisional legislator, and he will not accept or accept the non-divisional legislators. His position has never changed. In July this year, Su Jiaquan also publicly stated this position.
