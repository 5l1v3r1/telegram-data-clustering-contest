      <p>Sydney - Australian off-spinner <b>Nathan Lyon</b> said he was relishing "a fabulous opportunity" after agreeing a deal to become <b>Hampshire's</b> overseas player in next season's County Championship.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, a key member of Australia's Test team during the recent Ashes series, played a handful of games for Worcestershire in 2017, but this will be his first foray into the 10-team Division One.</p>
      <p>"It is a fabulous opportunity to be involved with a leading county who have had a long and successful relationship with Australian cricketers," said Lyon, who has taken 363 Test wickets to date.</p>
      <p>"I love playing cricket in England and no doubt will enjoy the 2020 summer with the Hampshire players, coaches, members and supporters.</p>
      <p>"We will all be focused on winning the County Championship in 2020 - I can't wait."</p>
      <p>Lyon is the latest Australian to sign with an English county for the 2020 season, with Travis Head joining Sussex, Cameron Bancroft at Durham and Peter Siddle returning to Essex.</p>
