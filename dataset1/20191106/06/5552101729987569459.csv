韓國瑜買豪宅　林飛帆酸：庶民是「別墅的墅」
06 Nov 2019, 06:51 by 黃揚明, 鄒保祥
標榜「庶民總統」的國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜遭踢爆曾在2011年無業時，購買總價高達近7,200萬元的北市南港豪宅。對此，民進黨副祕書長林飛帆今（6日）酸韓的「庶民總統」是「別墅的墅」。
林飛帆指出，韓國瑜有必要出面交代在什麼時間點購買、買房子的錢從哪裡來等問題。他認為，買這房子的錢可能一部份來自他創辦的雲林維多利亞學校的收入，「所以這個維多利亞的祕密恐怕就是靠學費來發大財。」
林飛帆強調，如果大家關心韓國瑜所提出有關教育、青年世代的政策，也同樣需要檢視他過去怎麼靠學費累積出這樣的財富。
民進黨主席卓榮泰對韓國瑜不願多談，僅說：「我想就是跟『做作』跟『不做作』有關而已。」

South Korea's Yu buys a luxury house Lin Feifan acid: The people are ""villas of villas""
06 Nov 2019, 06:51 by Huang Yangming, Zou Baoxiang
The Kuomintang presidential candidate, who was flaunted by the ""President of the People's Republic of China,"" was kicked out in South Korea. When he was unemployed in 2011, he bought a Nangang Nangang mansion with a total price of nearly 72 million yuan. In this regard, Lin Feifan, deputy secretary-general of the DPP, today (6th), the ""President of the People's Republic of China"" is the villa of the villa.
Lin Feifan pointed out that it is necessary for South Korea to come forward to explain when and where the money for buying and buying a house comes from. He believes that the money for buying this house may be partly due to the income of the Yunlin Victoria School he founded. ""So the secret of Victoria is probably to make a fortune by tuition.""
Lin Feifan emphasized that if everyone cares about the policy proposed by the Korean Yoga Institute for education and youth generation, it also needs to examine how he used to accumulate such wealth in the past.
The chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, Zhuo Rongtai, is not willing to talk more about South Korea’s Yu. He only said: ""I think it is related to ""doing nothing"" and ""not doing it.""
