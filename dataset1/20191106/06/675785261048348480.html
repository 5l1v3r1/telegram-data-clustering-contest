      <h2>The 22-year-old British backpacker was found dead in Auckland, New Zealand, and a 27-year-old man has gone on trial for murder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T06:20:14+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 06:20</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The last message British backpacker Grace Millane sent to her family before she was killed in New Zealand has been revealed.</p>
      <p>Grace shared a picture of a Christmas tree with her relatives back home in the UK on December 1 last year, the day before her 22nd birthday.</p>
      <p>The photograph, taken at Sky City hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, was the final thing she sent to her family, who she kept in contact with on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Her alleged killer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has pleaded not guilty to her murder and began his trial in Auckland today.</p>

      <p>Grace was found dead in a suitcase in bushland on December 9.</p>
      <p>A statement from her father David Millane was read out in court today.</p>
      <p>He described his 'Gracie' as gregarious and said she regularly messaged the family.</p>
      <p>"The three children would have a lot of banter going on and were particularly good at staying in contact," he said.</p>
      <p>"We heard from Grace virtually every day ... she seemed to be having a fabulous time."</p>

      <p>Grace's brother Michael previously said the family thought it was odd when Grace failed to reply to their texts on her birthday.</p>
      <p>"We thought maybe it's just the time zone, sort of catching up, but we looked into it and realised her messages hadn't been read or delivered," he said.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Grace was strangled to death by a 27-year-old man she met through the dating app Tinder.</p>

      <p>The defendant's defence team argue she died by accident when a consensual sex act went wrong.</p>
      <p>The alleged killer stands accused of murdering the Brit and then stuffing her body into a suitcase, which he is said to have buried in a shallow grave.</p>
      <p>The backpacker's parents came face-to-face with her alleged killer in court.</p>

      <p>The defendant broke down in tears and blew his nose when he heard her dad's evidence.</p>
      <p>The defendant was taken out of the courtroom when he said he felt unwell, though later returned for the hearing to continue.</p>
      <p>The trial is expected to last a month.</p>
