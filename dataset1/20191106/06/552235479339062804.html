      <h1>Jeremie Frimpong on his new Celtic song as rising star soaks up Parkhead atmosphere</h1>
      <h2>The full-back has been a revelation for Neil Lennon's side with some electric performances on show.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T06:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremie Frimpong admits he’s been dazzled by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> atmosphere swirling round Parkhead.</p>
      <p>Now he is desperate for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> to clinch last-32 qualification against Lazio so he can swap the comfort of the couch for centre stage at the party.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> kid wasn’t included in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s squad for the group stages and will again settle down in front of the telly tomorrow to cheer on his team mates.</p>
      <p>And at the forefront of his mind will be qualification so he can sample first hand the electric atmosphere of a Euro night under the lights.</p>
      <p>He said: “I will be an interested spectator on Thursday night. I will be watching it on the television back in my flat.</p>
      <p>“I think the team are ready. We’ve been playing well recently and hopefully the team can do it in Italy.</p>

      <p>“I’m desperate for the boys to qualify for the knock out stages so I can experience Celtic Park on a European night as a player.</p>
      <p>“If we keep playing like we have been playing then 100 per cent I’m confident we can get there.</p>
      <p>“It would mean everything to play a European night at Parkhead. Playing in the Europa League was one of my dreams so it would be really good. I used to watch it on television so playing in it would be unreal.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I had heard all about the atmosphere at Celtic Park and it’s lived up to my expectations. It’s been amazing.</p>
      <p>“When it goes dark and then the lights turn green, I had never seen that before. When I saw it for the first time I was like: ‘oh wow'</p>
      <p>"Then when everyone comes out of the huddle everyone is shouting and it’s so noisy. It’s so good.”</p>

      <p>Celtic have never beaten Italian opposition in Italy but Frimpong is confident: “100 per cent. Hopefully we can go there and do that.</p>
      <p>"The club has broken a few records in recent years so there’s no reason to think they can’t do it again.”</p>
      <p>The Dutch-born right-back refuses to think about next month’s Betfred Cup Final against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> despite being handed his first taste of Hampden in the semi-final win over Hibs.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been working hard for it and I was grateful for the manager that he chose me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It means everything that the manager trusts me. I’m a young kid but he knows I can do the job.”</p>
      <p>Frimpong has taken no time to win over the Parkhead faithful - with a clip showing supporters blasting out a song in his name doing the rounds on social media this week.</p>
      <p>He added: “I saw something on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“The fans were on a coach and I couldn’t understand the accent but they were saying: ‘Frimpong, Frimpong’ and I really liked it.”</p>
