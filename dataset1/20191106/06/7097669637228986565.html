      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Latest on election races for San Francisco (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:25 p.m.</p>
      <p>San Francisco Mayor London Breed is claiming victory in Tuesday's election while voters were snubbing out a bid to overturn a city ban on e-cigarette sales.</p>
      <p>Breed was ahead of five little-known challengers with some 60 percent of the votes when she declared victory about 90 minutes after the polls closed.</p>
      <p>She told a cheering crowd: "Thank you for honoring me with four more years as mayor!"</p>
      <p>Breed has been in office since winning a special election last year following the sudden death of Mayor Ed Lee.</p>
      <p>Voters also roundly rejected Proposition C, which was put on the ballot by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. San Francisco-based Juul dumped $12 million into the campaign before halting financial support two months ago.</p>

      <p>9:50 p.m.</p>
      <p>San Francisco Mayor London Breed appears to be coasting to victory while a proposition to overturn a city ban on e-cigarette sales seems destined for defeat in municipal elections.</p>
      <p>Shortly after polls closed Tuesday, Breed was tens of thousands of votes ahead of her five challengers.</p>
      <p>Her opponents are little-known and Breed had been expected to handily win her first four-year term.</p>
      <p>She's been in office since winning a special election last year following the sudden death of Mayor Ed Lee.</p>
      <p>Voters are roundly rejecting Proposition C, which was put on the ballot by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. San Francisco-based Juul dumped $12 million into the campaign before halting financial support two months ago.</p>
      <p>In early results, the measure is losing.</p>

      <p>Tuesday's ballot for San Francisco voters includes a race for mayor and a proposition to overturn a city ban on e-cigarette sales.</p>
      <p>Mayor London Breed faces five little-known candidates and is bound to win her first four-year term.</p>
      <p>She has been in office since winning a special June 2018 election following the sudden death of Mayor Ed Lee.</p>
      <p>Voters are also taking up Proposition C, which was put on the ballot by e-cigarette maker Juul Labs. The measure would overturn a new city law to ban sales of e-cigarettes until they have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
      <p>Juul is based in San Francisco and dumped $12 million into the campaign before halting financial support for the proposal in September.</p>
      <p>San Francisco has about 500,000 registered voters.</p>
