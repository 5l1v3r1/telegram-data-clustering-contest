      <h1>Outrage over £45 Cadbury's Selection Box on sale in Sainsbury's</h1>
      <h2>The deal has left many stunned</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T06:18:34+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 06:18</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Shoppers have been left stunned after spotting a Cabury's Selection Box on sale for £45 in Sainsbury's.</p>
      <p>Popular with many over the Christmas period, the above-average price tag has caused anger from customers who have described the price as a 'rip-off', <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shoppers-outraged-over-rip-off-20815252?_ga=2.245510151.2091945784.1572865886-1735012691.1561448173">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>the deal was spotted by Shane Butler, who promptly posted it on the money-saving site  <a href="https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/">Latest Deals</a> .</p>
      <p>His post got a lot of attention, with hundreds of people pointing out how much they could save buying the chocolate themselves.</p>

      <p>Cadbury's online description says: "Probably the World's biggest selection box, the Cadbury Ultimate Selection Box is ideal for sharing, containing 26 chocolate bars and weighing over 2 kilos.</p>
      <p>"Best of luck fitting this under the tree...."</p>
      <p>One user said it'd be cheaper than buying all of the chocolate bars separately, while another wrote: "Could make it myself for £25 and even have chocolate left over to do a smaller one.”</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "It could be because there is 2 Cadburys World tickets inside and think they retail at £12.85 each."</p>
      <p>Including those, the price drops to a far more reasonable £19.30 - making it cheaper than buying the chocolate yourself.</p>
      <p>The limited edition box measures a massive 75cm x 48 cm x 4cm, and weighs in at 2.1kg and includes 26 chocolate bars.</p>
