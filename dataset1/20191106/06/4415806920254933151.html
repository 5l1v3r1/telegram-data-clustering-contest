      <p>James got 30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds – his third consecutive triple-double – to help seal an 118-112 win.</p>
      <p>The Lakers have now won six straight games after losing their first of the season and sit top of the Western Conference table.</p>

      <p>It was little consolation that Zach LaVine got 26 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.</p>
      <p>In Cleveland, the Cavaliers were beaten 119-113 by the Boston Celtics – with 39 of the visitors’ points coming from Gordon Hayward.</p>
      <p>The Cavaliers had few answers to the quality of Hayward as he made his first nine shots and shot 17-for-20 from the field.</p>
      <p>Kemba Walker was also on form for Boston, scoring  25 points, including six three-pointers.</p>
      <p>The Celtics have now won five straight and move up to third in the Eastern Conference, while the Cavaliers remain third from bottom.</p>
