      <p>The president also touted his apparent ability to mobilize voters before <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections">Election Day</a>, citing Tuesday’s too-close-to-call gubernatorial race in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/kentucky">Kentucky</a>, as well as promising to host a rally in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana">Louisiana</a> to garner last-minute support for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans">Republican candidate</a> Eddie Rispone, who is running against Democratic incumbent Gov.

      <p>“Congratulations to @tatereeves on winning Governor of the Great State of Mississippi. Our big Rally on Friday night moved the numbers from a tie to a big WIN. Great reaction under pressure Tate!” Trump said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races. The increase in Governors race was at least 15 points, and maybe 20! Will be in Louisiana for @EddieRispone on Wednesday night. Big Rally!”</p>
