      <p>NAPLES, Italy (AP) — Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti is at risk of losing his job after his players deserted a club-ordered emergency training camp.</p>
      <p>Napoli says it will defend its “economic, patrimonial, image and disciplinary rights” after the players refused to stay at the club’s training center following a 1-1 draw with Salzburg in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The club added that organizing the training camp was Ancelotti’s “responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Ancelotti left the San Paolo Stadium without speaking to media after Tuesday’s game and did not attend the obligatory news conference following the team’s fourth straight match without a win in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Considered a title contender at the start of the season, Napoli has sunk to seventh in Serie A. The draw with Salzburg meant Napoli missed a chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti is in his second season at Napoli.</p>
