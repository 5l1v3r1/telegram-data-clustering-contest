中共推「26條措施」要「灣灣回家」，影響選情只是其中一部分
06 Nov 2019, 06:22 by 張宇韶


我們想讓你知道的是中共各種「惠台戰術」作為，大抵符合對台三戰的內涵：挑戰「兩岸人民關係條例」的適法性、創造中國崛起的和平繁榮假象、營造「發展是硬道理，穩定壓倒一切」的核心價值，而其背後最大的目的，其實是在美中貿易戰下把台灣拉成「主戰場」。



國台辦日前新推的「26條措施」，宣稱深入貫徹落實共產黨總書記習近平在《告台灣同胞書》發表40周年紀念會上的重要講話，和黨的19屆四中全會精神，完善「促進兩岸交流合作、深化兩岸融合發展、保障台灣同胞福祉」的制度安排和政策措施。此一政策提出時機，也正值台灣選戰日趨白熱化階段，隨即引發台灣輿論與朝野的討論與回應。
具體而言，「26條措施」其實體現十九大以來中共對台政策的整體戰略規劃，其政策脈絡與出手都存在可預期的週期性。
直言之，「軟硬兼施」與「和戰兩手」是統戰攻勢基本的內容，如果說十九大政治報告與年初習五點講話標誌「硬的一手」與政治高度，去年的「31項惠台措施」與當下的「26條措施」就是「軟的一手」與戰術執行。
中共統戰的目標：走進來、引出去
深入觀察，習近平十九大政治報告提出「中國夢」、「新時代」與「奪取社會主義現代化」等意識形態論述，直接把兩岸關係鑲嵌在中國崛與大國賽局大棋盤當中，時間期程就設定在「兩個一百」之間（2021中共建黨百年與2049中華人民共和國建政百年）。這意味北京已經揚棄「寄希望台灣人民」、「放權讓利」與「入島入戶入心」的傳統，取而代之則是「單邊主義」與「片面化」的思維——亦即「寄希望中國夢與中華民族偉大復興」才是台灣經濟發展的出路。
年初的習五點講話，索性將這套戰略簡化為「一國兩制台灣方案」，主張唯有在政治一中架構下以及參與中國崛起的過程中，台灣才得以享有和平與繁榮。

由於前述的政治宣示都有意圖改變現狀的動機，自然引發國際社會與台灣輿論的反彈，為了在實際政策面進行可執行的規劃，並讓各類的台灣代理人與紅色媒體進行議題操作，分別又提出了「31項惠台措施」或「26條措施」作為胡蘿蔔式的誘因，其邏輯不外是「國民待遇原則」與「走進來、引出去」的統戰作為，目的透過片面化的經濟優惠與交流便利性，直接矮化台灣的主權地位，並弱化民進黨政府在兩岸關係中的治理能力。
直白說，這些戰術作為大抵也符合對台三戰的內涵：在法律層面挑戰「兩岸人民關係條例」的適法性，在輿論上創造中國崛起的和平繁榮假象，在心理上營造「發大財」或「發展是硬道理，穩定壓倒一切」為核心價值的錯誤認知。
美中貿易戰下，中共需要將台灣變成「主戰場」
除了宏觀的戰略設定與戰術執行的設想外，「26條措施」也具備現實意義與權力關係。
在中共的十九屆中央委員會第四次全體會議中，就決議提出「國家治理能力」的概念，既然黨已經做出了政治宣示，政府部門必然是在美中經貿大戰、台北法案與介選等幾個指標議題上「有所作為」。
美中經貿大戰使得中國經濟面臨停滯與衰退的困境，資本、技術與人才的缺口為主要關鍵變數，如何在政治上止住台商的出走潮，同時透過代理人吸納台籍企業的生產能量，便成為中共當務之急。此外，美國國會通過「台北法案」已是既成事實，此一法案可視為集「台灣旅行法」、「亞洲再保證倡議」與「台灣保證法」於一成的具體政策，除了強化台美實質關係外，也讓台灣在經濟、外交與安全議題上與美國印太戰略直接接軌。

在兩方夾擊之間，北京為了展現在美中賽局的議價能力，必須選擇性的在兩岸議題中運作「主場優勢」——雖然中共一年多以來的出手，往往面臨被華盛頓進行「加碼式的報復」的後果。
在上述之後，最後才是台灣大選的考量。
中共透過議題的創造，提供國民黨與韓國瑜陣營進行輿論宣傳的政治資本，這點不難理解，從國民黨大欲批評民進黨政府「被中國當頭棒喝」，以及韓國瑜所謂「樂觀其成」的反應中，台灣輿論大概就能夠瞭解，國民黨為何會提出簽署兩岸和平協議與不敢聲援港人五點訴求的動機，與其背後對中國種種行為「不好說，說不好」的難言之隱。

The CCP pushes ""26 measures"" to ""go bay to go home"", affecting the election is only part of it
06 Nov 2019, 06:22 by Zhang Yuzhen


What we want you to know is the various ""Huitai tactics"" of the CCP. It is in line with the connotation of the three wars of Taiwan: challenging the lawfulness of the ""Regulations on the Relations between People on Both Sides of the Taiwan Straits"", creating the illusion of peace and prosperity in the rise of China, and creating ""the development is the last word."" The core value of ""stability overwhelming"", and the biggest purpose behind it is actually to pull Taiwan into a ""main battlefield"" under the US-China trade war.



The ""26 measures"" recently introduced by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council announced that it has thoroughly implemented the important speech of the Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping at the 40th anniversary of the publication of the Taiwan Compatriots and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Party Committee. Institutional arrangements and policy measures to promote cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, deepen cross-strait integration and development, and safeguard the well-being of Taiwan compatriots. The timing of this policy is also at the stage of the increasingly hot stage of Taiwan's election campaign, which immediately triggered discussions and responses from Taiwan's public opinion and the ruling and opposition parties.
Specifically, the ""26 measures"" actually reflect the overall strategic planning of the CCP's Taiwan policy since the 19th National Congress, and its policy context and shots have predictable periodicity.
To put it bluntly, ""soft and hard"" is the basic content of the united front. If the nineteen major political reports and the five-point speech at the beginning of the year mark ""hard hands"" and political height, last year's ""31 measures of Huitai"" The ""26 measures"" with the present are ""soft hands"" and tactical execution.
The goal of the CCP's united front: coming in and leading out
In-depth observation, Xi Jinping's 19th political report put forward ideological discourses such as ""Chinese Dream"", ""New Era"" and ""Capturing Socialist Modernization"", directly embedding cross-strait relations in the big chessboard of China's rise and the big country game, time period It is set between ""two hundred"" (2021 in the Communist Party of China and 2049 in the 20th year of the People's Republic of China). This means that Beijing has abandoned the tradition of ""respecting the people of Taiwan"", ""decentralizing power and making profits"" and ""getting into the island and entering the home"". Instead, it is ""unilateralism"" and ""one-sided"" thinking - that is, ""send hope to China"" The dream and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation are the way out for Taiwan’s economic development.
The five-point speech at the beginning of the year simply simplified this strategy into a ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"", arguing that Taiwan can enjoy peace and prosperity only in the process of political one-center structure and participation in China's rise.

Since the aforementioned political declarations have the intention to change the status quo, it naturally triggers the rebound of the international community and Taiwan's public opinion. In order to carry out the executable planning in the actual policy, and let the various Taiwanese agents and the red media conduct the issue, respectively The ""31 measures of Huitai"" or ""26 measures"" have been proposed as the cause of carrots. The logic is nothing more than the ""national treatment principle"" and the ""coming in and out"" united war. The purpose is through a one-sided economy. Concessions and exchange convenience directly dwarf Taiwan's sovereign status and weaken the DPP's ability to govern in cross-strait relations.
To be fair, these tactics are also in line with the connotation of the three wars against Taiwan: challenge the lawfulness of the ""Regulations on People's Relations between the Two Sides of the Taiwan Straits"" at the legal level, create the illusion of peace and prosperity in China's rise in public opinion, and create a ""great wealth"" in psychology. Or ""development is the last word, stability is overwhelming"" as the misunderstanding of core values.
Under the US-China trade war, the CCP needs to turn Taiwan into a ""main battlefield.""
In addition to the macro strategic setting and tactical implementation, the ""26 measures"" also have a practical and power relationship.
In the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the concept of ""national governance capacity"" was put forward in the resolution. Since the party has made political declarations, the government departments must be in the US-China economic and trade war, the Taipei bill and the selection. Wait for a few indicators to ""do something"".
The US-China economic and trade war has made the Chinese economy face the stagnation and recession. The gap between capital, technology and talents is the main key variable. How to stop the tide of Taiwanese businessmen politically, and at the same time absorb the production energy of Taiwanese enterprises through agents. It has become an urgent task for the CCP. In addition, the passage of the ""Taipei Act"" by the US Congress is a fait accompli. This bill can be regarded as a specific policy of ""Taiwan Travel Law"", ""Asia Reassurance Initiative"" and ""Taiwan Guarantee Law"", in addition to strengthening the essence of Taiwan and the United States. In addition to relations, Taiwan has also directly linked the US-Indian strategy to economic, diplomatic and security issues.

In order to demonstrate the bargaining power of the US-China match, Beijing must selectively operate the ""home court advantage"" in cross-strait issues. Although the CCP has been shooting for more than a year, it is often faced with being overweight by Washington. The consequences of revenge.
After the above, the final consideration is the Taiwan general election.
Through the creation of issues, the CCP provides political capital for public opinion propaganda by the Kuomintang and the South Korean Yu camp. It is not difficult to understand that the Kuomintang’s desire to criticize the DPP’s government is “drinked by China” and South Korea’s so-called “optimistic”. In the reaction, Taiwan’s public opinion will probably be able to understand why the Kuomintang has proposed the signing of a cross-strait peace agreement and the motive for not acknowledging the five-point appeal of the people of Hong Kong. It is not difficult to say ""not good to say bad things about China"".
Extended reading


The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council has again mentioned 26 ""the same treatment as the Chinese people"". The MAC has approved the ""one country, two systems"" policy.


China’s united front is directed at the private sector. How does Taiwan resist the full-scale offensive of the “31 measures of Huitai”?
