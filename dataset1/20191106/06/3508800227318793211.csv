從《印太戰略報告》到《自由開放的印太地區》，美國對台灣的戰略定位愈發清晰
06 Nov 2019, 06:28 by 精選轉載


我們想讓你知道的是我們的國際空間卻不斷受到威權中國的打壓，台灣能做的選擇還有多少？有什麼本錢不去和其他理念相近國家合作呢？想想看，如果我們可以在這國際政治的棋盤上面，當個有用的棋子，為何要只當個塞子呢？

台灣在美國的印太戰略當中到底扮演什麼角色？我們是棋子嗎？是商品嗎？是盟友嗎？相信這是很多人的疑問。事實上我們必須要從美國與整個亞洲太平洋的局勢來看，才會比較明朗；從六月份的《印太戰略報告》到兩天前（11月4日）剛出爐的《自由開放的印太地區：促進共同願景》這兩份報告當中，可以看到台灣的戰略角色變得非常明顯而突出。
今（2019）年六月初美國國防部發布的《印太戰略報告》（Indo-Pacific Strategy Report）中，在一開始「印太戰略的趨勢與挑戰」部分，便用三個不同的形容詞定位印太地區的三個國家：「修正主義式強權」的中國、「復甦的惡意行為者」俄羅斯，和「流氓國家」北韓。這樣的定位其實不難理解，因為在2017年，美國就將中俄視為企圖削弱美國領導能力並改變世界秩序的「修正主義強權」，而北韓則仍是柯林頓（Bill Clinton）和小布希（George W. Bush）政府所歸類的，批評國際制裁並具發展毀滅性武器武器野心的國家。
從美國將這些威權國家列為印太地區的挑戰可以判斷，美國「印太戰略」的願景表面上是希望建立「自由開放的印太地區」，實際上是試圖維護美國過去忽略並隨中俄近年強大而受威脅的亞洲民主秩序。此外，從美國將印度地位提升至如日本和以色列地位的夥伴關係，不難發現印度在歐巴馬（Barack Obama）政府「亞太地區」轉變為川普（Donald Trump）政府「印太地區」所扮演的重要角色。
當然，位於印太地區的台灣是否，又如何能以「與大多數亞洲國家無名義上建交關係」的角色融入美國「印太戰略」的架構是特別值得我們注意的地方。
在美國國防部發布的《印太戰略報告》中，美國一方面視台灣為維護國際秩序強大的民主夥伴，另一方面意識到中國對台灣在國際空間的打壓、未放棄武力統一台灣的意圖和持續發展具威脅性軍事能力的野心，因此，美國再次提及具政策彈性的《台灣關係法》，承諾會依此繼續售予台灣防禦性武器。這樣的說法看似平常，但早在這段內容的一開始，美國便強調印太地區的新加坡、紐西蘭、台灣和蒙古是四個值得信賴、有能力且是美國天生夥伴的「國家」（country），直接表明其將台灣看作是一個國家而非僅是個政治實體的立場。
儘管如此，雖然《印太戰略報告》中關於台灣的部分篇幅近整頁，台灣在「印太戰略」中的角色仍顯模糊，原因在於美國除了提到將會繼續售予台灣防禦性武器之外，並未進一步說明還有哪些可合作的實質合作內容。然而，美國將台灣納入印太戰略的意圖並不是只是說說而已。
在《印太戰略報告》公布後的這短短幾個月中，美國總統川普在八月批准66架F-16V軍售案，台灣空軍直接宣布增設一個聯隊；九月時，首屆「美台印太區域民主治理協商機制」正式啟動，希望台美雙方透過此對話機制一同促進印太區域秩序的安全；在台灣連續失去兩個邦交國之後，美國在台協會於十月初第一屆「太平洋對話論壇」中特別強調將支持台灣「在太平洋地區邦交國的發展需求」。美國幫助台灣鞏固外交關係的用意可見一斑；十月底時，美國參議院通過《台北法案》以強化支持台灣與印太地區及全球其他國家正式外交或非正式的夥伴關係。
而這些挺台作為只是美國將台灣在印太戰略中角色推到更高層次的前奏。以上的前情提要好像就有點過長，但這也顯示最近國際局勢變化速度很快，以及美國的戰略調整幅度不小。
在台灣時間11月4日上午，美國國務院在第二屆印太商務論壇開始的一小時前突然公布《自由開放的印太地區：促進共同願景》報告（A Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision）。在這份報告中可發現，隨著美國印太戰略實質內容逐漸明朗，台灣在其戰略中的定位亦有重大突破。以下將就《自由開放的印太地區：促進共同願景》報告分析。

首先，在加強雙邊夥伴關係的部分，美國首次在印太戰略中提到將與台灣的「新南向政策」緊密合作，同樣被列舉在此的還有日本「自由開放的印太概念」、印度「東進政策」、澳洲「印太地區概念」和韓國的「新南方政策」。耐人尋味的是，就日本而言，安倍已在2012年提出類似於此印太概念的「亞洲民主安全之鑽」（Asia’s Democratic Security Diamond），希望聯合美國、澳洲、日本與印度共同對抗中國崛起的威脅；2012年《澳洲在亞洲世紀白皮書》提及「印太」時特別強調了印度在此地區的角色；韓國在2017年提出的「新南方政策」則計畫提升與東協、印度的關係，撇開美國欲與印度的「東進政策」合作對抗中國不談，前三者皆無明確提到台灣的角色，而且他們所提到的印太相關戰略皆與軍事項目有關，唯獨台灣的「新南向政策」主要是以和東南亞國家經濟文化合作為主。因此，特別將台灣的政策與此四國相提並論，不僅凸顯台灣在「印太戰略」中的特殊性，在某程度上來說似乎希望將台灣的「新南向政策」納入「印太戰略」以提升至區域戰略的層次。
第二，美國在提到中國對台灣種種的壓迫行為時加重了語氣。《願景》報告指出，中國透過軍事演習、經濟壓力、壓縮國際空間、挖角外交夥伴來「霸凌」台灣，並提到美國支持台灣發展有效的嚇阻能力，川普政府通過的國防軍售便是一個例子。相較於今年六月初的《印太戰略報告》主要聚焦在台灣的國防安全，美國這次表示透過美國在台協會，百位印太策略專家將與台灣在「公共健康」、「女權」、「媒體假消息」和「數位經濟」的領域中合作。就「數位經濟」的合作部分，報告亦明確表示美國將與澳洲、日本、韓國、紐西蘭、新加坡及台灣共同面對5G發展時可能面臨的網路威脅。
第三，在「捍衛良善治理」的部分，美國強調其堅守宗教、言論、集會基本自由的決心，並公開要求中國停止其對維吾爾、吉爾吉斯、新疆穆斯林少數族群的壓迫暴力行為。《願景》報告亦告誡中國要信守《中英聯合聲明》對香港的自治和公民權利的承諾。此外也提到2018年美國副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）所公布的《印太透明倡議》，此倡議將與多國合作對抗反貪腐、促進財政透明、民主援助、青年發展、媒體自由與維護基本人權自由等跨國治理。其中，美國特別將台灣與澳洲、日本、紐西蘭並列為優先合作的夥伴，可見台灣民主自由與人權的發展對於印太地區的良好治理的重要性。
在最後結論的部分，《願景》報告指出美國兩大黨在立法機關所做的努力是驅使美國投入印太事務的關鍵原因。從美國國會通過《2018年善用投資促進發展法》與《2018年亞洲再保證倡議法》（美國曾表示這兩項法案皆涵蓋台灣）可見其對「印太戰略」的優先支持。此外，亦提及美國國會也透過立法的努力來強調美國對於維護台灣「國防」與「國際空間」的保證，而行政部門將會與國會繼續合作來強化政府全體對一個自由開放的印太地區的承諾（Congress has also …and underscored the U.S. commitment to Taiwan’s defense and international space, among other legislative efforts. The Administration and Congress will continue to work together to strengthen the whole-of-government commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region.）。
從結論可知，支持美國印太戰略持續發展的關鍵動力來自於其國會對立法的推動，而印太戰略對台灣的關注也將漸漸從國防拓展到台灣的國際空間，更特別的是，台灣竟然是在結論中唯一被提到的國家，足以見台灣在這份報告中的獨特性。此外，有別於美國行政部門常與立法部門不同調，《願景》報告更展現出其從2017年印太戰略的構想已發展至國內達成關於「印太戰略」的一致共識。
總結而言，美國的「印太戰略」並不只是其地緣政治的戰略構想，更是希望聯合意識形態類似的國家來制衡權力移轉論中，不滿現狀的崛起國家，即《印太戰略報告》中所指的中國及俄羅斯，尤其是近年崛起速度飛快的中國。從美中貿易戰到美國「印太戰略」內容的逐漸明朗，其實正反映著美國對於其歐巴馬政府亞洲政策的再調整，原因是美國已經意識到，無論是在經濟層面或是由其所領導的民主自由的國際秩序，皆已受到在資本世界中得利的中國等國家所侵蝕，而隨著這些國家的崛起並不斷的對外輸出其威權的意識形態，美國勢必得聯合各個國家抗衡並維護現有的國際秩序，而在印太地區的國家便是抵抗威權擴散的最前線。也因為在這樣的環境之下，民主發展穩定的台灣，才能在近年屢次與美國有外交上的突破，並能在與大多數國家無邦交的狀況下，在印太戰略中扮演具一定重要性的角色。
儘管有些人會認為台灣不過是大國政治下的棋子，沒什麼值得高興的；同時也不斷有人出來跟大家講說國會的立法都沒有實效，例如馬英九總統在國際場合演講，說國會的立法效力inconsequential。然而，美國行政部門都已經跳出來明白強調，印太戰略並不是只有國會的事，更是行政部門正在進行中的整個戰略調整，重新檢視與各個盟邦之間的關係。在台灣，種種質疑美國的那些論點正說明了，他們都選擇性地忽略目前威權國家與民主價值的對抗。尤其對台灣來說，身為民主國家，我們的國際空間卻不斷受到威權中國的打壓，台灣能做的選擇還有多少？有什麼本錢不去和其他理念相近國家合作呢？想想看，如果我們可以在這國際政治的棋盤上面，當個有用的棋子，為何要只當個塞子呢？

From the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy Report"" to the ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region"", the US's strategic positioning of Taiwan is becoming clearer.
06 Nov 2019, 06:28 by Featured Reprint


What we want you to know is that our international space is constantly being suppressed by authoritarian China. What is the choice that Taiwan can make? Is there any cost to cooperate with other countries with similar ideas? Think about it, if we can be a useful piece on this chessboard of international politics, why should we only be a plug?



Text: US Taiwan Watch: US Congress Taiwan Observatory
What role does Taiwan play in the US-Indian strategy? Are we a chess piece? Is it a product? Is it an ally? I believe this is a question for many people. In fact, we must be clear from the situation of the United States and the entire Asia-Pacific region; from the ""Indian Strategy Report"" in June to the ""free and open India"" that was just released two days ago (November 4) In the two reports of the Region: Promoting a Shared Vision, we can see that Taiwan’s strategic role has become very obvious and prominent.
In the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released by the US Department of Defense in early June 2019, at the beginning of the ""People's Strategy Trends and Challenges"" section, three different adjectives were used to position the prints. Three countries in the region: China with ""revisionist power"", ""revived malicious actors"" Russia, and ""rogue states"" North Korea. This positioning is not difficult to understand, because in 2017, the United States regards China and Russia as ""revisionist powers"" that attempt to weaken US leadership and change the world order, while North Korea is still Bill Clinton and small. A country classified by the George W. Bush government that criticizes international sanctions and has the ambition to develop weapons of destruction.
Judging from the challenges of the United States as an authoritarian country in the Indo-Pacific region, the vision of the US ""Indo-Pacific Strategy"" is ostensibly to establish a ""free and open Indo-Pacific region"". In fact, it is trying to maintain the US’s past neglect and follow China and Russia. A powerful and threatened Asian democratic order in recent years. In addition, from the United States' promotion of India's status to a partnership such as Japan and Israel, it is not difficult to find that India's Barack Obama government's ""Asia-Pacific region"" has changed to the Donald Trump government ""Indo-Pacific region"". Play an important role.
Of course, whether Taiwan, located in the Indo-Pacific region, can be integrated into the US ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" with the role of ""no name relationship with most Asian countries"" is a place that deserves our attention.
In the ""Indo-Philippines Strategic Report"" issued by the US Department of Defense, the United States regards Taiwan as a strong democratic partner in maintaining the international order on the one hand, and on the other hand, on the other hand, it recognizes China’s intention to suppress Taiwan’s international space and renounce the use of force to unify Taiwan. The ambition to continue to develop threatening military capabilities, the United States once again mentioned the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" with policy flexibility, and promised to continue to sell Taiwan's defensive weapons. This argument seems normal, but as early as the beginning of this content, the United States has emphasized that Singapore, New Zealand, Taiwan and Mongolia in the Indo-Pacific region are four “states” that are trustworthy, capable and American natural partners. (country), directly indicating that it regards Taiwan as a country rather than just a political entity.
Despite this, although the ""Indian Strategy Report"" on Taiwan's part of the page is nearly full page, Taiwan's role in the ""Indian Strategy"" is still vague, because the United States, in addition to mentioning that it will continue to sell to Taiwan's defensive weapons. In addition, there is no further explanation on what other substantive cooperation content can be cooperated. However, the intention of the United States to include Taiwan in the India-Pacific strategy is not just to talk about it.
In the short months after the publication of the ""Indian Strategy Report"", US President Trump approved 66 F-16V arms sales cases in August, and the Taiwan Air Force directly announced the addition of a wing; in September, the first ""beauty"" The Taiwan-India-Taiwan Regional Consultation Mechanism for Democratic Governance was officially launched. It is hoped that Taiwan and the United States will promote the security of the Indian-People’s regional order through this dialogue mechanism. After Taiwan’s continuous loss of two state diplomatic relations, the US Taiwan Association’s first session in early October The Pacific Dialogue Forum places special emphasis on supporting Taiwan’s ""development needs in the Pacific countries."" The intention of the United States to help Taiwan consolidate its diplomatic relations is evident; at the end of October, the US Senate passed the ""Taipei Act"" to strengthen support for Taiwan's formal diplomatic or informal partnership with the Indo-Pacific region and other countries around the world.
These platforms are just a prelude to the United States pushing Taiwan's role in the Indian-Pacific strategy to a higher level. The above ex-situ summary seems to be a bit too long, but it also shows that the recent international situation has changed rapidly, and the strategic adjustment of the United States is not small.
On the morning of November 4th, Taiwan time, the US State Department suddenly announced the ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific Region: Promoting a Shared Vision"" report an hour before the start of the 2nd India-Pacific Business Forum (A Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision). In this report, it can be found that with the gradual clarification of the substantive content of the US-Indian Pacific, Taiwan has made a major breakthrough in its strategy. The following analysis will be conducted on the report ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Promoting a Shared Vision"".

First of all, in strengthening the bilateral partnership, the United States first mentioned in the India-Pacific strategy that it will work closely with Taiwan’s ""new southward policy"". Also listed here is Japan’s ""free and open concept of Indo-Taiwan"". India's ""Dongjin Policy"", Australia's ""Indo-Pacific Concept"" and South Korea's ""New South Policy"". Intriguingly, as far as Japan is concerned, Abe has proposed the “Asia's Democratic Security Diamond” in 2012, which is similar to the Indian concept. He hopes to unite the United States, Australia, Japan and India to fight against China’s rise. Threat; the 2012 Australia White Paper on Asia Century highlighted the role of India in this region; the “New South Policy” proposed by South Korea in 2017 is planned to enhance relations with ASEAN and India. Regardless of the United States' desire to cooperate with India's ""eastward policy"" against China, the first three do not explicitly mention the role of Taiwan, and the related strategies they have mentioned are related to military projects, but Taiwan's ""new The Southward Policy is mainly based on economic and cultural cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, in particular, comparing Taiwan’s policies with these four countries not only highlights Taiwan’s particularity in the ""Indo-Pacific strategy,"" but to some extent seems to hope to incorporate Taiwan’s ""new southward policy"" into the ""Indo-Pacific strategy."" Upgrade to the level of regional strategy.
Second, the United States has increased its tone when it comes to China’s oppressive actions against Taiwan. The Vision report pointed out that China has ""bullying"" Taiwan through military exercises, economic pressure, compression of international space, and diplomatic partners. It also mentioned that the United States supports Taiwan's effective deterrent ability to develop, and the defense arms sales passed by the Trump government are one example. Compared with the ""Indian Strategy Report"" in early June this year, the focus is on Taiwan's national defense security. The United States said that through the American Association of Taiwan, hundreds of Indian strategists will be working with Taiwan on ""public health"", ""female rights"" and "" Cooperation in the field of ""fake media news"" and ""digital economy"". As for the cooperation part of the ""digital economy"", the report also clearly stated that the United States will face the cyber threats that may be faced in the development of 5G with Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan.
Third, in the part of ""defending good governance,"" the United States emphasizes its determination to adhere to the basic freedoms of religion, speech, and assembly, and publicly demands that China stop its oppressive violence against Uighurs, Kyrgyzstan, and Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The Vision report also warned China to abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration's commitment to Hong Kong's autonomy and civil rights. In addition, the Indo-Transparency Initiative, published by US Vice President Mike Pence in 2018, will be mentioned. This initiative will work with many countries to combat anti-corruption, promote fiscal transparency, democratic aid, youth development, and media freedom. Maintaining transnational governance such as basic human rights freedom. Among them, the United States has especially listed Taiwan as a priority cooperation partner with Australia, Japan and New Zealand. It can be seen that the development of Taiwan's democratic freedom and human rights is of great importance to the good governance of the Indo-Pacific region.
In the final conclusion, the Vision report pointed out that the efforts of the two major parties in the legislature are the key reasons for driving the United States into India. From the US Congress, the ""1818 Investment in Development"" Act and the 2018 Asian Reassurance Initiative Act (the United States has stated that both bills cover Taiwan) can see its priority support for the ""Indo-Pacific Strategy."" In addition, the US Congress also emphasized the US's guarantees for safeguarding Taiwan's ""national defense"" and ""international space"" through legislative efforts, and the executive branch will continue to cooperate with Congress to strengthen the government's openness to a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Congress has also ...and underscored the US commitment to Taiwan's defense and international space, among other legislative efforts. The Administration and Congress will continue to work together to strengthen the whole-of-government commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific Region.).
From the conclusion, the key driving force for the continued development of the US-Indian strategy is the promotion of legislation by its Congress, and the Indian-Pacific strategy will gradually expand its focus from national defense to Taiwan's international space. More specifically, Taiwan actually It is the only country mentioned in the conclusion that it is enough to see Taiwan's uniqueness in this report. In addition, unlike the US administration, which is often different from the legislative department, the Vision report shows that the concept of the Indo-Pacific strategy from 2017 has developed to reach a consensus on the “Indo-Pacific strategy”.
In conclusion, the ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" of the United States is not just a strategic concept of geopolitics. It is also a hope that countries with similar ideologies will balance the power transfer theory, and the rising country that is dissatisfied with the status quo, that is, the India-Pacific strategic report. China and Russia referred to in this article, especially China, which has risen rapidly in recent years. The gradual clarification of the US-China trade war to the US ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" actually reflects the US's readjustment of its Obama policy in Asia, because the US has realized that it is at the economic level or by its The international order of democracy and freedom led by them has been eroded by countries such as China, which have benefited from the capital world. With the rise of these countries and the continuous export of their ideology of authoritarianism, the United States is bound to unite with countries to compete. And to maintain the existing international order, the country in the Indo-Pacific region is the front line against the proliferation of authoritarianism. Also, under such an environment, Taiwan, with its democratic development and stability, can make diplomatic breakthroughs with the United States in recent years, and can play a certain role in the India-Pacific strategy in the absence of diplomatic relations with most countries. character of.
Although some people think that Taiwan is nothing more than a chess piece under the politics of a big country, there is nothing to be happy about. At the same time, there are people who come out to tell you that the legislation of the National Assembly is not effective. For example, President Ma Ying-jeou speaks on an international occasion and says that the legislative effect of the Congress is inconsequential. However, the US administration has jumped out and stressed that the India-Taiwan strategy is not only a matter of Congress, but also the entire strategic adjustment of the administrative department, and re-examines the relationship with various allies. In Taiwan, all the arguments that question the United States illustrate that they selectively ignore the current confrontation between authoritarian states and democratic values. Especially for Taiwan, as a democratic country, our international space is constantly being suppressed by authoritarian China. How much can Taiwan make choices? Is there any cost to cooperate with other countries with similar ideas? Think about it, if we can be a useful piece on this chessboard of international politics, why should we only be a plug?
