      <p>In incredible news for cat and comedy lovers everywhere, Kate McKinnon has been cast in <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/kate-mckinnon-joe-exotic-series-1203393396/">a new Hulu series</a> based on <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/joe-exotic-and-his-american-animals.html">the true story</a> of a woman who busted an illegal exotic-cat operation. The series will be based on the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/podcasts-fall-2019.html">Wondery podcast</a> <i>Joe Exotic </i>(check out Intelligencer’s <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/joe-exotic-and-his-american-animals.html#comments">full coverage</a> of the story here, written in collaboration with Wondery). This marks McKinnon’s second podcast-to-TV-show venture. McKinnon was previously cast as Elizabeth Holmes in the Hulu adaptation of ABC News’ podcast, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/kate-mckinnon-is-playing-elizabeth-holmes-in-a-hulu-drama.html"><i>The Dropout</i></a>, which tells the story of the downfall of the blood-testing company Theranos. This is also the second Wondery podcast to be developed into a TV show; the first, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/alec-baldwin-christian-slater-join-forces-against-dr-death.html"><i>Dr. Death</i></a>, is headed to NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock, and will star Alec Baldwin and Christian Slater. Here’s hoping for a crossover between all of these podcast-TV hybrids!</p>
