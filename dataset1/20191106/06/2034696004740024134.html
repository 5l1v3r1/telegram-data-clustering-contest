      </p>
      <p>Stephen King has revealed that he considers Mike Flanagan’s new movie <i>Doctor Sleep</i> a faithful big-screen adaptation of his 2013 dark fantasy horror novel, saying it was a redeeming sequel to Stanley Kubrick’s <i>The Shining</i>.</p>

      <p>“I read the script to this one very, very carefully,” the author told <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/05/stephen-king-doctor-sleep-redeems-the-shining-stanley-kubrick/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>. “Because obviously I wanted to do a good job with the sequel, because people knew the book <i>The Shining</i>, and I thought, I don’t want to screw this up.”</p>
      <p>King also revealed that he trusted Flanagan’s vision, having worked with the filmmaker previously on another movie adaptation of his 1992 thriller novel, <i>Gerald’s Game</i>. “I’ve enjoyed all his movies,” King said. “I read the [<i>Doctor Sleep</i>] script very, very carefully and I said to myself, ‘Everything that I ever disliked about the Kubrick version of <i>The Shining</i> is redeemed for me here.’”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>King is famous for his dislike of Kubrick’s 1980 film adaptation. In a 2006 interview with <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5653/stephen-king-the-art-of-fiction-no-189-stephen-king"><i>The Paris Review</i></a>, the writer said that Kubrick had “no sense of emotional investment in the family whatsoever.” He also described the movie as “a Cadillac with no engine in it.”</p>
      <p>“You can’t do anything with it except admire it as sculpture,” King added. “You’ve taken away its primary purpose, which is to tell a story.”</p>
      <p><i>Doctor Sleep </i>is set decades after the events of <i>The Shining</i>, and follows a now-adult Dan Torrance (played by Ewan McGregor) who meets a young girl with supernatural powers. In a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/doctor-sleep-review-the-shining">four-star review of the film, <i>NME</i> wrote</a>: “<i>Doctor Sleep</i> is a thrilling, nostalgia-fuelled ride that does its best to appease fans of the original, as well as those brought up on newer King flicks like <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/pet-sematary-2465575"><i>Pet Sematary</i></a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/it-chapter-2-review-stephen-king-pennywise"><i>It: Chapter Two</i></a>“.</p>
      <p><i>Doctor Sleep </i>is playing in theatres now.</p>
