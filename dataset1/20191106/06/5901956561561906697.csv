Sara je v Kmetiji deležna veliko pozornosti. To je bilo še posebej vidno, ko se je v kopalkah sončila na pomolu. Denis in Rene sta jo opazovala na drugi strani ribnika in skušala pritegniti njen pogled.

A Sare, ki je na kmetiji menda spoznala, kdo je in kaj si želi (pravi, da se ne misli omejevati), nista navdušila. »Dva mladeniča se šopirita, kot Tarzana skačeta in iščeta pozornost kot pavijani, ki se gonijo.«

Sara has received a lot of attention at the Farm. This was especially evident when she was sunbathing on the pier in her swimwear. Denis and Rene watched her on the other side of the pond, trying to get her eyes.

But Sare, who at the farm allegedly realized who she was and what she wanted (she said she didn't think to limit herself), was not impressed. ""The two young men are shopping like Tarzan jumping and looking for attention as the baboons are chasing.""
