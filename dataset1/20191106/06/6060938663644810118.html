      <p>FUZHOU (CHINA): There was no end to Indian shuttler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/saina-nehwal">Saina Nehwal</a>'s lackluster run of form as the Olympic bronze-medallist crashed out of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/China-Open">China Open</a> here on Wednesday following a straight-game opening-round defeat to local favourite <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cai-Yan-Yan">Cai Yan Yan</a>.</p>
      <p>The world no.9 Saina lost 9-21, 12-21 in the women's singles clash that lasted just 24 minutes to make an early exit from the USD 700,000 tournament.</p>
      <p>However, in men's singles, Saina's husband and personal coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Parupalli-Kashyap">Parupalli Kashyap</a> registered a comfortable straight-game victory over Thailand's Sitthikom Thammasin.</p>
      <p>The Indian outsmarted his Thai opponent 21-14, 21-13 in 43 minutes. He will face seventh seed Victor Axelson of Denmark in the second round.</p>
      <p>World Championships bronze medallist B Sai Praneeth also made it to the second round beating Tommy Sugiarto of Indonesia 15-21, 21-12, 21-10 in a 52-minute hard-fought opening round battle. The world no. 11 Indian will take on fourth seed Anders Antonsen of Denmark in the next round.</p>
      <p>However, it was curtains for compatriot Sameer Verma as he lost 18-21, 18-21 against Hong Kong's Lee Cheuk Yiu in a opening round contest that lasted 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>The mixed doubles pairing of Pranav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy also made a first-round exit. The duo went down 14-21, 14-21 to Wang Chi-Lin and Cheng Chi Ya of Chinese Taipei.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Saina has been going through a tough phase with regards to her fitness since claiming the Indonesia Masters in January.</p>
      <p>She made three consecutive first-round exits before reaching the quarterfinal of the French Open last month.</p>
      <p>To add to India's woes, the men's doubles pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy also crashed out in the first round, losing 21-23, 19-21 to Malaysian combination of Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik.</p>
