      <p>To further strengthen its capabilities of hitting enemy targets from submarines, India is planning to test-fire the 3,500 kilometre strike-range K-4 nuclear missile from an underwater platform off the coast of Andhra Pradesh on Friday.</p>
      <p>The missile system is being developed by the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-drdo">DRDO </a>for the Arihant class nuclear submarines which are being built by India. These submarines would be the mainstay of India's nuclear triad.</p>
      <p>"As per plans, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-drdo">DRDO </a>will carry out test-firing of the K-4 nuclear missile from an underwater platform off the Vishakhapatnam coast on Friday. During the trial, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-drdo">DRDO </a>will test the advanced systems in the missile system," government sources said here.</p>
      <p>K-4 is one of the two underwater missiles that are being developed. The other one is the over 700 kilometre strike range BO-5 missile.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear whether the DRDO will test the missile at the full strike range or shorter ranges. However, NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) and marine warnings for long-range missile test have already been issued by India for the planned test-firings.</p>
      <p>The K-4 missile test was planned for last month but was postponed.</p>
      <p>DRDO also plans test-firing of the Agni-3 and BrahMos missiles in the coming few weeks.</p>
      <p>Government sources clarified that the test-firing of the K-4 would be done from an underwater pontoon as the missile is still being tested and launch from a submarine would only be done once it is ready for deployment.</p>
