政府仍在审查收购国库控股的南北大道股权献议

（吉隆坡6日讯）政府仍在审查各种收购国库控股（Khazanah Nasional Bhd）的51%南北大道（PLUS Malaysia Bhd）股权献议。
经济事务部长拿督斯里阿兹敏表示，政府正在从财务角度评估收购的影响，并通过降低使用成本来履行对高速公路使用者的责任。
“我们考虑的步骤之一是降低过路费，或者是否可以在短期内废除收费站。”
他今日出席2019年马来西亚可持续发展目标峰会时告诉记者：“竞选宣言明确指出，我们将与特许公司分阶段进行讨论。我们不想加剧政府目前的财政状况，同时又想将援助范围扩大到人民和公路使用者，所以这一切仍在考虑之中。”
阿兹敏是针对财政部将收购国库控股的南北大道股权的报导，如是回应。
报导指，财政部正在考虑收购国库控股的南北大道股权，以免资产流向私人公司。
知情人士表示，财政部将收购南北大道，并把资产留在公共领域，而这个收购计划很快会提交内阁审议。
阿兹敏表示，他还未看到报导所指的财政部建议书。
“我们尚未决定，国库控股拥有51%南北大道股权，雇员公积金局有49%。从技术上来说，两间都是政府投资臂膀，因此我们会看如何协助政府降低过路费。”
他补充说：“我还未看到（财政部的）建议书，我相信是由工程部审查。”
政府之前证实收到四份有关收购南北大道的建议书，来自Widad Group Bhd、Maju Holdings私人有限公司、RRJ Capital及企业家Tan Sri Halim Saad。

The government is still reviewing the acquisition of the National Bank’s North-South Avenue equity offer
06 Nov 2019, 06:44 by Bernama
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Bernama) -- The government is still reviewing various offers to acquire PLUS Malaysia Bhd from Khazanah Nasional Bhd.
Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Azmin said the government is assessing the impact of the acquisition from a financial perspective and fulfilling its responsibilities to highway users by reducing the cost of use.
“One of the steps we considered was to reduce tolls, or whether to abolish toll stations in the short term.”
He told reporters today at the 2019 Malaysia Sustainable Development Goals Summit: ""The campaign declaration clearly states that we will discuss the concession company in stages. We do not want to exacerbate the current financial situation of the government, but also want to extend the scope of assistance to the people and Road users, so this is still under consideration.""
Azmin is responding to the report that the Ministry of Finance will acquire the equity of Nanku Avenue, which is controlled by Treasury.
According to the report, the Ministry of Finance is considering the acquisition of the equity of Nanbei Avenue, which is controlled by Treasury, so as to avoid the flow of assets to private companies.
People familiar with the matter said that the Ministry of Finance will acquire North and South Avenues and leave assets in the public domain, and the acquisition plan will soon be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration.
Azmin said that he has not seen the Ministry of Finance's proposal.
“We have not yet decided that treasury holdings own 51% of the North and South Avenue shares, and the Employees Provident Fund Board has 49%. Technically, both are government investment arms, so we will see how to help the government reduce tolls.”
He added: ""I have not seen the (Ministry of Finance) proposal, I believe it is reviewed by the engineering department.""
The government has previously confirmed that it has received four proposals for the acquisition of North and South Avenue, from Widad Group Bhd, Maju Holdings Sdn Bhd, RRJ Capital and entrepreneur Tan Sri Halim Saad.
