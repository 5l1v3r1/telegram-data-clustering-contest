Twinings Are Selling An Advent Calendar Full Of Tea For The Whole Xmas Countdown

06 Nov 2019, 06:00

Spooky season has passed, Bonfire night is nearly upon us, and soon enough it’ll be December 1. There are so many reasons why Christmas is amazing. Between the awesome food, markets, and parties, it truly is the best time of the year. And the beginning of December means one thing: advent calendars. But getting a treat every morning doesn’t always have to be chocolate based. Here are the nine best non-chocolate advent calendars.
While Christmas Day morning may be the one day a year where eating a Terry’s Chocolate Orange, drinking Bucks Fizz, and opening gifts from your loved ones before 9 a.m., is acceptable, every morning can be filled with a little bit of joy in the run up to Christmas. Advent calendars are the little bit of indulgence that make the season all the more magical, and even if you don't have a sweet tooth, you shouldn't miss out.
If coffee, tea, make up, alcohol, or something even more naughty are more your poison, then there is an advent calendar that caters to you. And luckily, I've wrapped them all up in a nice neat bow and put them in the list below. Merry Christmas, one and all.
