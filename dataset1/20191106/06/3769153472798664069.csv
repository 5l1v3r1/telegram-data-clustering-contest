Hello blenderheads.In the past I wondered if it was possible to make a kind of algorithm that could transfer a mesh topology from one model to another.Well after a lot of work, I can say... It's perfectly possible!This add-on I call Softwrap and is my approach to solve this problem, It took almost one year of work and research\trial and error to get working and it works!



I've been working on this project for a while and its finally ready for a release.You can find it on the Blender Market.And there's also its thread on Blender Artists, hope you guys like!
