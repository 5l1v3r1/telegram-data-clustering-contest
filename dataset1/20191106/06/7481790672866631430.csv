野球部監督、硬球投げて元部員の太もも命中…「地面に投げた」と報告

06 Nov 2019, 06:45

　愛媛県立大洲高校野球部で７月、５０歳代の監督が部員に至近距離から硬球を投げつける暴力行為があった。監督は日本学生野球協会から１か月間の謹慎処分を受けたが、この際、学校側が協会に報告した内容に誤りがあったことがわかった。今後、協会に訂正を報告し、監督の処分についても改めて判断を仰ぐという。
　暴力を受けた後、退部した元部員やその弁護士によると、７月下旬、学校のグラウンドで守備練習中、監督が「声を出していない」などと言って、元部員に向かって至近距離から硬球を投げつけた。学校は、暴力行為として協会に報告した際、経緯について「監督が地面に向かって投げたボールが生徒の膝下に当たった」などと説明していた。
　不祥事を報じるニュースを見た元部員から「事実と違う」と抗議を受けたため、学校側が改めて関係者から聞き取ったところ、実際は元部員の太ももに直接ボールが当たっていたことが判明したという。
　学校側の弁護士からの通知文書によると、監督は元部員にボールを３球投げつけ、１球が太ももに当たったことを認め、謝罪する意向という。
　八木俊博校長は「弁護士に任せており、今は何も答えられない。真摯（しんし）に対応していく」と話すにとどめた。
