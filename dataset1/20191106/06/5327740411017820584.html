      <p>VANCOUVER — Jaden Schwartz scored at 3:28 of overtime to give the St. Louis Blues a 2-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The winner came on a 3-on-0 after Vancouver’s Tyler Myers fired a shot that missed wide of the opposition’s net and went the length of the ice with three Blues chasing. Schwartz finished off a tic-tac-toe play alongside Alex Pietrangelo and Brayden Schenn.</p>
      <p>Canuck goaltender Jacob Markstrom smashed his stick in anger after the goal.</p>
      <p>Vancouver (9-3-3) rookie Quinn Hughes tied the game 1-1 with 3:35 remaining. Hughes sent a fluttering shot from the blue line that went over the shoulder of Blues goaltender Jordan Binnington. Elias Pettersson was screening on the play.</p>
      <p>Tyler Bozak, with his first goal of the season, also scored for the Blues (10-3-2). Binnington finished the night with 33 saves and is 6-1-0 his last seven games.</p>
      <p>It was the fifth consecutive win for the defending Stanley Cup champions, who are 7-1-0 in their last eight games.</p>

      <p>The Canucks had a chance to tie the game earlier in the third when the David Perron was called for cross-checking Canucks defenceman Chris Tanev at 5:44 of the third period. Vancouver managed just one shot on the power play and finished the night 0 for 4 on the power play, with just six shots.</p>
      <p>Jake Virtanen also came close in the third when he rang a shot off the post at 7:51. Brandon Sutter had a short-handed breakaway at 10:45 but couldn’t beat Binnington.</p>
      <p>Markstrom stopped 25 shots for Vancouver. The Canucks are (7-1-3) in their last 11 games.</p>
      <p>Bozak’s goal came at 3:37 of the second period. Sammy Blais made a nice play in the corner, feathering a puck between two Canucks defenders to Bozak, who tucked the puck past Markstrom.</p>
      <p>The first period was scoreless but Vancouver had two great chances. Early on Pettersson turned a Brock Boeser pass into a breakaway but was stopped by Binnington. Later J.T. Miller found himself alone in front of the net but he too couldn’t beat the Blues goalie.</p>
      <p>Pettersson had another chance in the second period. He used his speed to distance himself from a pair of Blues chasing him and ripped a shot that Binnington got a piece of.</p>
