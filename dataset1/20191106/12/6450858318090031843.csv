The Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL, first announced in Spring at the company's I/O event in California, became available to buy as of 8 May, 2019. We've scoured the internet to bring you the very best Pixel 3a and 3a XL deals in the UK.
Google's new mid-range phones are more affordable than ever, at almost half the price of the Pixel 3. They have a familiar design with the two-tone finish on the rear like the Pixel 3, available in Clearly White, Just Black and Purple-ish. There are a few downgrades such as a lack of waterproofing and wireless charging, but for those looking for a Pixel phone at a lower price, you've got it.
Read our reviews of the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, plus find out how the new model compares with the Pixel 3 in our Pixel 3a vs Pixel 3 comparison. You can also see the best cases for the Pixel 3a and 3a XL phones here.
