      <h1>Weather contingencies in place for North Lanarkshire ahead of General Election</h1>
      <h2>Officials describe the timescale for the December 12 election as “challenging”, but say all the necessary arrangements are currently being put in place.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>Severe weather contingencies and polling place bookings have been put in place as North Lanarkshire’s officials make arrangements to run next month’s general election.</p>
      <p>Officials describe the timescale for the December 12 election as “challenging”, but say all the necessary arrangements are currently being put in place for voters in the constituencies of Airdrie &amp; Shotts and Motherwell &amp; Wishaw.</p>
      <p>Depute returning officer Stephen Penman said: “For severe weather, we have extensive contingency plans to deliver council services, as we’d still be delivering all those while an election is going on.</p>
      <p>“A winter election is unusual, but the council is used to making plans for severe weather and we’re in the process of ensuring that weather-related risks are mitigated, including access to polling places and availability of staff.</p>
      <p>“We’re fully prepared to hold the general election; although the timescale is challenging, we have well-developed plans in place.”</p>
      <p>Parties have now started on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>Wishaw MP Marion Fellows, first elected in 2015, is hoping to return to Westminster with an increased majority.</p>
      <p>She said: “I will fight Scotland’s corner against any UK Government and protect our right to decide our EU membership with a people’s vote. Scotland must have the right to choose its own future.</p>
      <p>“I have enjoyed working for and representing communities over the past four years. I want to keep fighting for them.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s candidate in Wishaw, Angela Feeney, said: “I am proud to be the Parliamentary candidate for Labour for Motherwell and Wishaw.</p>
      <p>“As an NHS employee and a trade unionist I see the harsh realities of Tory misrule every day. I am ready to take the Labour message to the people and to present our radical manifesto to them.”</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have also named their candidate for the constituency.</p>
      <p>Meghan Gallacher said: “Motherwell and Wishaw deserves an MP who will put the people they represent first, not one who will seek to further divide this country.”</p>
      <p>Shotts MP Neil Gray also kicked off his General Election campaign earlier this week</p>
      <p>He said: “I have fought for the people of this constituency ever since my election in 2015 and I will keep up that fight.”</p>
