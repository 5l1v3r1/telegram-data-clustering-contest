      <p>Never have I wanted to learn about creating music for film more than before watching the trailer for Danny Elfman's new <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/danny-elfman-teaches-music-for-film">MasterClass</a> ($90). In it, he talks about being "constantly insecure" despite having over 100 film scores under his belt. But quickly follows up with, "It's okay to fail." I mean, that's just solid advice for <i>anyone</i> pursuing creative activities. I appreciate that he goes beyond the "how-to" of composing a film score and goes into what it means to be a working artist -- being filled with doubts and insecurities and doing it anyway.</p>
      <blockquote>And I think all artists that are worth their anything are filled with doubt all the time. And the few that just don't have any doubt, I think they're destined become-- they could be very successful. They could be good workmen. They could be good craftsmen. <br/><br/>But they're not gonna be the really great artists. Because I think doubt and art are kind of combined. They're just-- it's almost impossible to pull them apart doubt. <br/><br/>Doubting yourself and then finding confidence and moving forward and then doubting what you've just done and then working through that, I think this is the life of a composer, and I think it's the life of an artist in general. And it's OK to feel that way.</blockquote>
      <p>The class is 21 online sessions, including one that's a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/danny-elfman-teaches-music-for-film/chapters/tim-burton-s-the-nightmare-before-christmas"><i>Nightmare Before Christmas</i> case study</a>. The single class costs $90 or you can get an "all-access pass" for $15/month that allows you to watch other MasterClass classes (David Lynch, Penn &amp; Teller, etc.).</p>
      <blockquote>From The Simpsons theme to the soundtracks of Tim Burton’s Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Danny Elfman’s compositions are original, memorable, and exuberantly weird. Now the Oingo Boingo founder and four-time Oscar nominee shares his unconventional (and uncensored) creative process. Step into Danny’s studio and learn his techniques for evoking emotion and elevating a story through music.</blockquote>
