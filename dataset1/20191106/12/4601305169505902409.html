      <p>Art director <a href="https://twitter.com/ota_imon">Ota Imon</a> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/09/the-indiebeat-corona-blacks-style-comes-from-mech-punches-space-westerns-and-color-blindness/">explained the look</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“The black and white style was mostly because me and my brother, we’re color blind,” said Imon in a phone call with GamesBeat. “I didn’t want to work with colors, because it would be so much trouble for us. So I just got lazy and figured, we could do things the way we wanted, without worrying about that.”</blockquote>
      <p>In between battles, you can explore the story and improve the mech:</p>
