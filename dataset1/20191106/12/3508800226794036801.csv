06 Nov 2019, 12:34 by 羊正鈺


我們想讓你知道的是針對此一判決，魏應充指示律師出面召開記者會宣布後續行動，並在記者會採訪通知信中表示強烈不滿。



（中央社）頂新前董事長魏應充涉及劣油案，二審判刑15年。最高法院今（6）日將45罪發回更審，另駁回26罪的上訴而告確定；確定部分，魏應充7罪刑度合計5年9個月，另有19罪得易科罰金。
魏應充判刑確定而不得易科罰金的7罪刑度，分別為11個月、11月、1年6月、7月、7月、8月、7月，合計5年9月。實際執行刑度將由檢察官另外向法院聲請應執行刑，最高法院已通知檢方啟動防逃機制。
最高法院判決指出，二審判決僅可認定魏應充知悉頂新向大幸福收購的油脂屬欠缺可供人食用品質的原料油，時間點為103年3月20日召開糧油事業群經營決策會時起，卻認定魏應充要為在此之前完成的交易負共犯罪責，有判決理由不備等違法，這部分撤銷發回，其餘上訴駁回。
最高法院新聞稿指出，除魏應充，常梅峯、陳茂嘉、楊振益等人上訴也是部分撤銷發回、部分駁回。
確定部分，常梅峯21罪、陳茂嘉32罪、楊振益39罪，都包含不得易科罰金之罪，須入監，頂新公司罰金刑也是部分發回更審、部分確定。此外，頂新、魏應充也聲請提案刑事大法庭，最高法院認無提案必要，今天予以駁回。
全案起於民國102年間，大統長基爆發摻混油並添加銅葉綠素事件，引爆一連串油安事件。當時任頂新董事長的魏應充等人被控為節省成本，謀求油源穩定，自101年至103年間，明知越南大幸福公司販售的原料油欠缺可供人食用的品質，仍予以收購，充作已具供人食用品質的原料油，精煉製成食用油販售。
一審彰化地方法院認為，檢察官無法證明全案油品是來自於非健康豬隻屠體為原料所熬製的豬脂等有礙健康原料，104年11月27日判魏應充等人無罪。案經上訴，由台灣高等法院台中分院審理。

二審認為，頂新向大幸福購入的原料油酸價過高、金屬鉛含量不符食用油脂類衛生標準，越南官方亦指大幸福外銷油脂只能作飼料，不能供人食用。台中高分院認為，魏應充等人自101至103年間，藉此獲利新台幣1億1919萬餘元，涉犯食品安全衛生管理法販賣假冒食品罪及刑法詐欺取財罪。

台中高分院去年4月27日宣判，魏應充判刑15年（6年可易科罰金）、前總經理常梅峯判刑8年6月（3年可易科罰金）、後任總經理陳茂嘉判刑11年6月（5年可易科罰金）、大幸福負責人楊振益判刑8年6月（1年6月可易科罰金），頂新公司罰金2億5000萬元。
針對此一判決，魏應充指示律師出面召開記者會宣布後續行動，並在記者會採訪通知信中表示強烈不滿。針對最高法院部分駁回頂新製油大幸福案二審上訴，頂新製油公司強烈不滿，預計今晚召開記者會，宣布後續行動。

The Supreme Court ruled that the new and inferior oil case, Wei Yingchong decided to go to jail for 5 years and 9 months
06 Nov 2019, 12:34 by 羊正钰


What we want you to know is that for this judgment, Wei Yingchong instructed the lawyer to hold a press conference to announce the follow-up action, and expressed strong dissatisfaction in the notice letter of the press conference.



(Central News Agency) Wei Xin, the former chairman of Dingxin, involved the case of inferior oil, and the second sentence was 15 years. The Supreme Court sent 45 crimes back to the trial on this (6th) day, and rejected the appeal of 26 crimes. The determination part, Wei Yingchong 7 crimes total 5 years and 9 months, and 19 crimes.
Wei Yingchong sentenced the sentence to the penalty of 7 crimes, which were 11 months, November, June, July, July, August, and July, totaling 5 years and September. The actual execution of the sentence will be punishable by the prosecutor to the court, and the Supreme Court has notified the prosecution to initiate an anti-evasion mechanism.
The Supreme Court ruled that the second-instance judgment can only be determined that Wei Yingchong knew that the oil purchased by Dingxin to Daxing was a raw material oil that was not available for human consumption. The time was from the start of the grain and oil business group decision-making meeting on March 20, 103. However, it was determined that Wei Yingchong had to bear a total criminal responsibility for the transactions completed before this, and that there were illegal reasons for the judgment, and this part was revoked and sent back, and the rest of the appeal was rejected.
The Supreme Court press release pointed out that in addition to Wei Yingchong, Chang Meifeng, Chen Maojia, Yang Zhenyi and other appeals were partially revoked and partially rejected.
To determine the part, Chang Meifeng’s 21 crimes, Chen Maojia’s 32 crimes, and Yang Zhenyi’s 39 crimes all include the crime of not being able to fined the penalty, and must be admitted to the prison. The penalty for the new company is also partially sent back for review and partial determination. In addition, Dingxin and Wei Yingchong also called for the proposal of the Criminal Court. The Supreme Court recognized that no proposal was necessary and rejected it today.
The whole case began in the 102 years of the Republic of China. The Datong Changji broke out with a blend of oil and added copper chlorophyll, which triggered a series of oil safety incidents. At that time, Wei Yingchong and others, who were appointed as the new chairman of the board, were accused of saving costs and seeking stable oil sources. From 101 to 103, they knew that the quality of the raw materials sold by Vietnam’s Happiness Company was not available for human consumption. It is used as a raw material oil that has been eaten for human consumption and refined into edible oil for sale.
The Changhua District Court of the first instance held that the prosecutor could not prove that the oil in the case was from the unhealthy pig carcass as raw materials, such as pig fat, which hindered healthy raw materials. On November 27, 104, Wei Yingchong and others were acquitted. The case was appealed and was tried by the Taichung Branch of the Taiwan High Court.


The first case of the new case is judged that Wei Yingchong and other six people are not guilty... The judge told you these nine reasons.


The second trial held that the acid value of the raw material oil purchased by Dingxin from the big happiness was too high, and the metal lead content did not meet the hygienic standard of edible oils and fats. The Vietnamese official also said that the big happy export oil can only be used as feed and not for human consumption. The Taichung High-Technology Institute believes that Wei Yingchong and others have benefited NT$19.19 million from 101 to 103 years, committing crimes of selling fake foods under the Food Safety and Health Administration Law and criminalization of criminal law.


Wei Yingchong was sentenced to 15 years from innocence, and the new statement issued: My oil is completely legal


Taichung High School announced on April 27 last year that Wei Yingchong was sentenced to 15 years (6 years can be fined), former general manager Chang Meifeng was sentenced to 8 years in June (3 years can be fined), and later general manager Chen Maojia sentenced 11 In June of the year (5 years of the company's fines), the person in charge of the great happiness Yang Zhenyi was sentenced to 8 years in June (one year in June, the company was fined), and the new company was fined 250 million yuan.
In response to this judgment, Wei Yingchong instructed the lawyer to convene a press conference to announce follow-up actions, and expressed strong dissatisfaction in the notice letter of the press conference. In response to the Supreme Court's partial rejection of the second-instance appeal of the Dingxin Oil-making Happiness Case, Dingxin Oil Company was strongly dissatisfied. It is expected that a press conference will be held tonight to announce follow-up actions.
