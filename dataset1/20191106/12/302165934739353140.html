      <p>PARIS, Nov 6 — France is to clear out some migrant tent camps, impose quotas for migrant workers and deny newly-arrived asylum seekers access to non-urgent healthcare, in a drive to show voters President Emmanuel Macron is heeding their concerns about immigration.</p>
      <p>“We want to take back control of our immigration policy,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, a Macron appointee, told reporters as he unveiled a package of measures on immigration.</p>
      <p>“That means when we say yes it really means yes, and when we say no, it really means no.”</p>
      <p>Macron is seeking re-election in 2022, and opinion polls show he will be in a tight race with far-right opposition party leader Marine Le Pen, who has bolstered her support by accusing Macron of being too soft on immigration.</p>
      <p>Macron’s centrist administration has so far resisted pressure from right-wing rivals on immigration, but in announcing the new measures, it joins other European states, among them Italy, Britain and Sweden, that have opted to take tougher approaches on migrants.</p>
      <p>The French prime minister said the new measures were the mark of a “France that is open but is not naive.”</p>
      <p>“I think we have found the right balance between reassuring our citizens and not giving ground to populism” he said. — Reuters</p>
