7 Apps To Track Your Followers' Instagram Activity

06 Nov 2019, 12:00

If you're trying to appeal to your audience and grow your Instagram following, learning from your followers could be the key to success. While Instagram itself does offer analytics about how your followers engage with your posts, you have to have a business account to access these. But that's not your only option — there are also several third-party apps you can use to track followers' Instagram activity.
Before it was removed, you could check Instagram's Following Activity Tab to find out which posts and accounts your individual followers were liking and following. Instagram Insights, which is available for business accounts, offers more in-depth info by giving you a breakdown of your interactions, reach, and impressions. This can really help if you put out a lot of sponsored or paid content and want to see how it's doing. A business account also allows you to see the gender, age, and location of followers and other users that are interacting with your posts.
If you don't want to convert your account to a business profile, however, there are apps you can download that let you in on your followers' activity trends as well as information about how much they're interacting with your posts. These features usually come included in apps that help you check who's unfollowed you. All you have to do is download them, give them permission to access your account, and let them do the rest of the work.
Here are seven apps to use to track your followers' Instagram activity:
1. Followers Track for Instagram!

The Followers Track for Instagram! app allows you to understand who follows you, who unfollows you, and who interacts with your posts. Through this information, the app also allows you to see who your most and least active followers are, based on who likes and comments on your posts the most and least. Plus, the app lets you see which accounts you're following that don't follow you back and vice versa. This can help you decide whether or not to keep around certain followers.
2. Tracking Instagram Followers
Tracking Instagram Followers lets you in on a lot of information regarding your followers. Aside from main tools like tracking unfollowers, the app also shows you which of your followers are inactive, which users like or comment on your posts without following you, and which followers interact with you the most. It also gives you other analytic information like which of your tags is the most popular, what timings are the best to post at, and even what timings are best to put up a Story at.
3. Reports+ for Instagram
