　台風１９号で浸水被害があった福島県郡山市で、東京電力福島第一原発事故の避難者向けに建設されたプレハブ仮設住宅を台風の被災者向けに転用する作業が進んでいる。６日は今年度末で廃止予定の「富田町若宮前団地」で、エアコンや水回りの清掃作業が始まった。
　同市では１１か所の避難所に約３５０人が身を寄せ、仮設住宅への入居も進んでいる。市営住宅などを用意したが足りないため、原発事故後に建設され、入居者がいなくなった仮設住宅を活用した。３団地で約１５０戸用意し、既に１２世帯の入居が完了している。
　入居期間は最長で今年度末までとし、家賃や駐車場は無料。この間に次の住まいを探してもらうという。

Temporary housing for nuclear accident evacuees, diverted to typhoon victims

06 Nov 2019, 12:05



Temporary housing was reused for households affected by floods, and cleaning work was carried out (in the afternoon of 6th in Koriyama City, Fukushima Prefecture)

In Koriyama City, Fukushima Prefecture, where flood damage was caused by Typhoon No. 19, work is underway to convert prefabricated temporary housing built for TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi accident to evacuees. On the 6th, cleaning work for air conditioners and water began at the Tomitacho Wakamiya Mae Complex, which is scheduled to be abolished at the end of this fiscal year.
In the city, about 350 people have settled in 11 evacuation centers and are moving into temporary housing. We prepared temporary housing that was built after the nuclear accident and no longer had tenants because we prepared city housing. About 150 units have been prepared in 3 housing complexes, and 12 households have already been moved in.
The longest occupancy period is until the end of the current fiscal year, and rent and parking are free. During this time, they are asked to find the next home.
