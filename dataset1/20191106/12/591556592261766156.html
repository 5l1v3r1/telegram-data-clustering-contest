      <p>Annoying tech-support scammers have found a new way to lock up Firefox. It's part of a scam to convince victims they need to call a bogus 'Windows support' hotline because their PC has an illegitimate license. If victims don't call within five minutes, the scammers threaten to disable the computer.</p>
      <p>The scammers are abusing a bug in Firefox that for years allowed fraudsters to slug users with login prompt spam, presenting victims with incessant 'authentication required' prompts. <br/><br/>The prompts act as a browser locker because they stop users from leaving or closing the browser. This July, Mozilla issued a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twelve-years-later-firefox-to-add-full-protection-against-login-prompt-spam/">fix in Firefox 68 that was meant to prevent the attack</a>.  <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-tips-for-new-cybersecurity-pros-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>10 tips for new cybersecurity pros</b></a><b> (free PDF)</b><br/><br/>The fix involved blocking all types of 'authentication required' prompts, including those generated by the site's main domain. </p>
      <p>However, Jérôme Segura, head of Threat Intelligence at Malwarebytes, this week found that tech-support scammers have found a bypass for Mozilla's fix, allowing them to use the same tactics to con victims. </p>

      <p>He's since filed a bug report with Mozilla and its developers are <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571003">working on fix for a future release</a> of the browser. </p>
      <p>But he's also found a second browser lock technique <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438214">reported to Mozilla two years ago</a> that to this day remains unfixed. The tech support scam page, which is still live today, was originally designed to target Chrome but was <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/malwarebytes-news/2018/02/tech-support-scammers-find-new-way-jam-google-chrome/">fixed in Chrome version 67</a>. </p>

      <p>The messaging on the browser lock page is full of falsehoods. Beneath the 'Windows support' number provided, it states: <br/><br/><i>Do not ignore this important warning</i><br/><i>Please stop and do not close the PC</i><br/><i>The registry key of your computer is locked.  </i><br/><i>Why did we block your computer?  </i><br/><i>The Windows registry key is illegal.  </i><br/><i>This Windows desktop is using pirated software. </i><br/><i>This Windows desktop sends viruses over the Internet.  </i><br/><i>This Windows desktop is hacked.  </i><br/><i>We block this computer for your safety.  </i><br/><i>Please call us within 5 minutes to prevent your compute from being disabled. </i></p>
