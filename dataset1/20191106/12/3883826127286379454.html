        <b>A man convicted of murdering his eight-week-old daughter, 13 years after he seriously injured another child, has been jailed for life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Eves, of Wixams, near Bedford, smothered Harper Denton and left her with numerous fractures, including one to her skull, in June 2018.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was jailed in 2006 for assaulting a toddler in his care, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>He has been ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years.</p>
      <p>During his trial, Eves, of Nightingale Court, told the jury he awoke to find Harper purple and cold to the touch, claiming her injuries - 34 rib fractures and a fractured skull - were caused by his attempts to resuscitate her.</p>
      <p>However, jurors heard the fractures were inflicted during at least three separate assaults in the weeks before her death.</p>
      <p>Eves was jailed for nine years in 2006 - when known as Forbes - for causing grievous bodily harm with intent and wilfully assaulting a toddler in his care when living in Bournemouth. He was released in 2010.</p>
      <p>The boy suffered life-threatening head injuries and fractures to his elbow.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said the assault was "so similar" to the one that killed Harper.</p>
      <h3>'Uncontrolled rage'</h3>
      <p>The prosecution said Harper's mother, Cherinea Denton, who was acquitted of her daughter's murder, was aware Eves had a previous conviction but believed his account that it was connected to a fight at a house party.</p>
      <p>Sentencing Eves, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said the "protracted and escalating violent attacks" he carried out on Harper were "cruel, brutal and vicious".</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately you did not have the instincts to protect and nurture that most parents have," she added.</p>
      <p>"You were insensitive to the fragility of your baby and you were unable or unwilling to put her needs before your own comfort. You had uncontrolled rage."</p>
      <p>Ms Denton, who suffers from chronic fatigue, was not present in court but said in a victim statement: "My beautiful girl had her future stolen from her by somebody that she should have been able to trust and count on for the whole duration of her life - a life that should have lasted longer than eight weeks."</p>
      <p>Harper's grandmother, Debbie Denton, said the loss of the "loved and adored" child "shook this family to its core".</p>
      <p>"Mr Eves serves no purpose within a tight-knit family and certainly not amongst children. Had we known this, he would have never been welcomed into ours."</p>
      <h3>'Horrific injuries'</h3>
      <p>After the sentencing, Colin Foster, director of children's services at Bedford Borough Council, said a serious case review was being carried out.</p>
      <p>"The Eves family were not known to social services in Bedford Borough and the authority was not made aware of the previous convictions," a statement said.</p>
      <p>Det Insp Dani Bailey, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "Baby Harper suffered immensely in her short life at the hands of the person who should have been protecting and looking after her.</p>
      <p>"The injuries she sustained were horrific and the fact they were deliberate is even more shocking."</p>
