Cape Town - Kanye West has made a couple of changes to his life which include embracing religion.
This has led to a few differences in opinion between him and his wife of five years, Kim Kardashian-West, when it comes to her appearance, E! News reports.
In a recent episode of The Real, Kim opened up about the compromises she has had to make in her marriage in order to honour her husband.
Kanye has expressed disapproval over the revealing and constrictive Thierry Mugler dress she wore at the 2019 Met Gala, saying that her sexy look deeply affected him.



""I do think that, you know, he is my husband so I obviously want to honour him and what he's feeling,"" Kim said told the hosts of The Real.
""He's been going through this life change and it's mostly about the kids,"" she added.
Kanye has changed his parenting approach by being more cautious in the way he is raising his four children, North (6), Saint (3), Chicago (1) and five-month-old Psalm.
According to the Daily Mail he removed the televisions that were in their bedrooms to control what they see and also got rid of North’s make-up room.
