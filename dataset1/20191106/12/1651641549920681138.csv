Minecraft Earth Early Access now available in the UK
06 Nov 2019, 12:51 by Ash

The Early Access stage of Minecraft Earth is currently building its way across the globe and, as of today, is officially available in the UK.

Along with the UK, Minecraft Earth Early Access is also available in Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Sweden, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland.
You can pick up Minecraft Earth on iOS here (if you’re in one of the above countries but can’t see it yet – don’t panic! Just check back later today) and on Android here.



In the current Early Access build, players can throw down a buildplate and create an interactive Minecraft diorama.
They’ll also be able to find tappables and unlock resources and unique mobs, craft and smelt resources, collaborate with other Early Access builders, and fight hostile mobs in adventures.



Here are just some of the features of Minecraft Earth:

Collecting: Minecraft Earth features many of the mobs that Minecraft players know and love (and potentially hate), along with new ones. The more you play, the higher the chance of discovering unique variants and using them to populate your builds.
Exploring: You can explore the world around you to gather resources, take on challenges, and experience a whole new blocky world.
Collaborating: You can team up with other Minecraft Earth players to craft together! You know what they say – it takes a village to craft a whole bunch of Minecraft creations, or something like that.
Surviving: You can battle Minecraft mobs in real life! Just make sure you don’t stand too close to the Creepers.

With its launch in the UK, the total number of countries with Early Access to Minecraft is nine. Who will be the 10th lucky country? We’ll just have to wait and see.
If you want to be one of the first to know which countries will get Early Access next, you can follow the official Minecraft Earth Twitter account.
Minecraft Earth should be out globally by the end of 2019. The game will support all the same languages as regular vanilla Minecraft. To play Minecraft Earth, you’ll need a mobile device that runs at least Android 7 or iOS 10. You’ll also need a Microsoft or Xbox Live login account.
