（中央社曼谷6日綜合外電報導）泰國軍方發言人今天表示，暴力頻傳的南部地區有兩處檢查站遇襲，疑為穆斯林叛亂分子犯案，造成至少15人死亡，另有4人受傷，死亡人數為近年來最多。
過去15年來，人口以馬來穆斯林為主的泰南地區頻傳血腥叛亂，已經造成7000多人喪生。
泰國南部軍方發言人普拉莫（Pramote Prom-in）告訴法新社，好戰分子昨晚在也拉省（Yala）攻擊兩處配置民防志願軍的檢查站，他們在一群村民停下來聊天時，朝志願軍開槍。
普拉莫說：「12人死於攻擊現場，2人送醫後不治，另有1人今晨死亡。」他又說，叛亂分子拿走檢查站的M-16步槍與霰彈槍。他說，檢查站周圍地區已經封鎖，目前正在進行鑑識調查。
叛亂分子尋求讓與馬來西亞接壤且具獨特文化的地區自治，一直在對抗以佛教徒為主的泰國。
泰國深南地區專家董恩（Don Pathan）說，昨天的攻擊是「很長一段時間以來」規模最大的協同襲擊。這些事件在最近幾年變得比較少見，但攻擊力道變得「更加密集」。董恩說：「這提醒我們他們還在那裡。」（譯者：張曉雯/核稿：徐睿承）1081106

(Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th, comprehensive foreign news report) Thai military spokesman said today that two southern police stations were frequently attacked, suspected Muslim criminals committed crimes, causing at least 15 deaths and four others injured and died. The number is the highest in recent years.
Over the past 15 years, the bloody rebellion in the southern part of the country, dominated by Malay Muslims, has killed more than 7,000 people.
Pramote Prom-in, a military spokesman in southern Thailand, told AFP that militants attacked two checkpoints at the Civil Defence Forces in Yala last night. They stopped at a group of villagers to chat. At the time, the volunteers fired.
Pramo said: ""12 people died at the attack site, 2 people died after being sent to hospital, and another one died this morning."" He added that the insurgents took the M-16 rifle and shotgun at the checkpoint. He said that the area around the checkpoint has been blocked and a forensic investigation is currently underway.
The insurgents have sought to make regional autonomy with a unique culture that borders Malaysia and have been fighting against Thailand, which is dominated by Buddhists.
Don Pathan, an expert in the deep south of Thailand, said yesterday's attack was the largest coordinated attack ""for a long time."" These incidents have become less common in recent years, but the attack power has become ""more dense."" Dong En said: ""This reminds us that they are still there.""
