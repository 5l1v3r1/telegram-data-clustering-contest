      <h1>Amazon discounts Prime subscriptions by $40 for veterans</h1>
      <h2>You can also take advantage of the promotion if you're a current armed forces member.</h2>

      <p>With Veterans Day coming up, Amazon has launched a new promotion aimed at armed forces members. Starting today and until November 11th, if you've served in the military, or are a current active duty or reserve member, you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/prime/promo/pricing/landing/ref=as_li_ss_tl?promoID=A3J87G75D3ZPEJ&amp;ref_=us_mil_assoc&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=productpost2019hybrid-20&amp;linkId=ada5d3243962e6f8e8051ef986da1851&amp;language=en_US">$40 off the first year of an Amazon Prime subscription</a>. If you're already a subscriber, fret not: you can use the promotion as a way to extend your membership at a discount.</p>
      <p>At $79, the add-on is even cheaper than it was before Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/26/amazon-raises-prime-fee-to-119-in-the-us/">raised its price from $99 to $119 last year</a>. Not that anyone needs a breakdown of Prime anymore, but in addition to free one- and two-day shipping, it includes access to Prime Video and Prime Music, among other perks. Prime Video, in particular, has become <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/10/good-omens-neil-gaiman-jon-hamm-nuclear-apocalypse/">surprisingly good in the last year</a>.</p>
      <p>A couple of restrictions to note before jumping on the deal: you can't take advantage of the discount if you're already a Prime Student subscriber. Additionally, it's not possible to use Amazon and partner rewards points to make the subscription even cheaper.</p>
