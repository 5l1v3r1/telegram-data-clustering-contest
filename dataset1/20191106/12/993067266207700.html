      <p>Grace Jones has accepted an invite to curate next year’s Meltdown festival, saying “it’s about time”.</p>
      <p>The singer, 71, known for her androgynous look and distinctive wardrobe, will oversee and headline the Southbank Centre event.</p>
      <p>Jones, who has previously performed at Meltdown,  said she was “honoured” to turn her hand to curating.</p>
      <p>She added: “Year after year, the festival continues to spread its colourful wings, allowing its curators to bring together an array of diverse talent not seen anywhere else.</p>

      <p>“It’s about time I was asked to curate Meltdown darling, don’t you think?!”</p>
      <p>Jones was one of the first black supermodels before signing to Island Records.</p>
      <p>She became a star of New York City’s Studio 54-centred disco scene and in the 1980s moved to a new-wave hybrid of reggae, funk, pop and rock.</p>
      <p>Albums include Warm Leatherette, Nightclubbing, and Slave To The Rhythm.</p>
      <p>She is also known for starring as a villain in Bond film A View To A Kill and for slapping presenter Russell Harty live on air in 1981 when she thought that he was ignoring her.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Jones declared that current female singers like Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus have no taboos to break because she had smashed them all.</p>
      <p>She accused chart topping stars of today of copying her, writing in her autobiography: “They dress up as though they are challenging the status quo but by now, wearing those clothes, pulling those faces, revealing those tattoos and breasts – that is the status quo.”</p>

      <p>And Jones also warned of life in the music industry: “If you haven’t got a long-term plan then you are just a passing phase, the latest trend, yesterday’s event.”</p>
      <p>Previous curators of the music and arts festival have included The Cure’s Robert Smith,  David Bowie, Yoko Ono, rapper MIA and Jones’s former collaborator Nile Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Bengi Ünsal, head of contemporary music at Southbank Centre, said: “There’s no denying it, Grace Jones is unlike anybody else…</p>
      <p>“She is one of the few living artists who can truly be described as iconic, with a relentlessly individualistic vision.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Grace Jones’s Meltdown runs from June 12-21 next year at the Southbank Centre, London, with line-up details to be announced. </i>
