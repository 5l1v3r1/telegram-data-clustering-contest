Fossil announces new hybrid smartwatches with always-on display and 2 week battery life
06 Nov 2019, 12:17 by Pradeep





Fossil Group today announced Hybrid HR, the latest addition to the hybrid smartwatch category. The new Hybrid HR smartwatch features always-on e-ink display that can display important information such as text messages, alerts, caller ID, heart rate and activity tracking. Fossil claims that this new smartwatch will offer 2 weeks of battery life. It is important to note that Hybrid HR is not powered by Google’s WearOS, instead it runs on proprietary platform developed in-house by Fossil.
“With Hybrid HR, we continue to broaden Fossil Group’s diverse portfolio, offering the most – and most innovative – hybrid and touchscreen smartwatch options of any company in the world,” said McKelvey.

Highlights of Hybrid HR:


Always-on Display: Combines mechanical hands with a dynamic, full round read-out display to view incoming text messages, caller ID and app alerts as well as dynamic, contextual information such as weather updates, second time zone and more
Customization: Allows users to choose between a variety of backgrounds, dial elements and button assignments to designate which notifications you receive or functions to perform – from texts to app alerts or reminders to get up and move
Long Lasting Battery Life: With all features activated, Hybrid HR lasts more than two weeks on a single charge
In-Depth Wellness Tracking: Displays wellness stats including heart rate, steps, calories and active minutes, and allows users to log workouts, track sleep and measure progress over time

Hybrid HR smartwatches will be available this holiday season starting at $195.
