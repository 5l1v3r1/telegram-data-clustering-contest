      <p>A mum looks unrecognisable after spending £19,000 changing the way she looked - thanks to her nan's inheritance cash.</p>
      <p>Tracy Cook was left £60,000 when her grandmother Doris died, aged 92, and shed an incredible 10 stone after gastric sleeve surgery.</p>
      <p>Within five months, she's gone from an unhappy 21 stone 10 pounds to a 11 stone 10 pounds yummy mummy.</p>
      <p>And she says her new look has given her a new energy and zest for life.</p>
      <p>Doris had made Tracy promise to spend the money on herself after she spent years bringing her three children up alone.</p>
      <p>Tracy, a 49-year-old hairdresser from Peterborough, Cambs, said: "I have always been a chunky girl, I have been trying all my life to lose weight, I couldn't get my head around it, I think I've tried every diet on the planet.</p>

      <p>"Since being a parent it has been the hardest. As a single mum of three kids, trying to juggle everything, my only treats were bars of chocolate.</p>
      <p>"I was really close to my nan, she was always telling me 'I'd love to see you happy, I'd like you to lose some weight and meet somebody and be happy.</p>
      <p>"She was taken really poorly and she told me 'I've left you some money and I want you to spend them on you, not on the kids, not paying bills, not doing anything else, just spend it on you- and that's exactly what I've done.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't have done it without my nan's money, I wouldn't have gotten a loan to have it done because I would have felt I was being really selfish but when my nan told this is what she wanted me to do with it, that was it for me.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I still felt I had to put half of the money away from my children's futures - but I hope my nan would be happy if she could see how it's changed all of our lives."</p>
      <p>Tracy had been dreaming of transforming her look for years, and managed to save enough money to have a gastric sleeve operation herself before her nan died.</p>

      <p>But since Doris died, she was more determined than ever to lose all her excess weight -10 stone - and has since had 13.2lb of loose skin removed.</p>
      <p>She plans to have even more surgery in December, when she will have 6.6lb removed.</p>
      <p>In August she had a '360 lower body lift', which is a removal of the hanging skin, from the front and the back and a breast reduction that cost £15,000.</p>
      <p>She is also planning to have another procedure in December, to get rid of the skin in the inner thighs and upper arms which is going to cost another £10,000.</p>
      <p>She added: "Although the pain was awful, I did wake up the next morning, looked at myself in the mirror and thought 'Oh my God, I love that belly!'- it was the most exciting thing.</p>
      <p>"My tummy skin literally hung on my thighs- I used to tell my kids, when I was going up the stairs my tummy was giving me a round of applause, no more rounds of applause anymore!</p>

      <p>"I am very very happy, I have had a massive confidence boost, I feel better with myself and now I even have a man in my life.</p>
      <p>"It literally has transformed me- it's not just about the weight loss.</p>
      <p>"The weight loss has given me the strength to do things I would never have done before.</p>
      <p>"I have been going to the gym, which I never thought it could happen- I was thinking I'm never going to be able to do a class or keep up with anybody and now it's awesome because I am doing exactly the same things as the skinny girls in front of me.</p>
      <p>"It's euphoric, it's an amazing feeling.</p>
      <p>"I keep calling my surgeon a 'magician', she is a miracle lady who managed to transform me."</p>

      <p>Tracy has given the rest of the money to her children Charlotte, 23, Mitchell, 21 and Tiffinni, 18.</p>
      <p>She added: "Giving them money has enabled them to have a deposit to get their own houses. I know I wouldn't be in a position to do it ever again but if I had spent all the money on me I'd be thinking I could so help the kids.</p>
      <p>"I have done something that it changed my life so I wanted to help my children to set up their lives with the rest of it."</p>
