      <p>George Carlin, of the so-called "silent generation" that preceded the boomers:</p>
      <blockquote>"I'm getting tired of hearing about...whiny, narcissistic, self-indulgent people with a simple philosophy: "GIMME IT, IT'S MINE!" "GIMME THAT, IT'S MINE!" These people were given everything. Everything was handed to them. And they took it all: sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and they stayed loaded for 20 years and had a free ride. But now they're staring down the barrel of middle-age burnout, and they don't like it. So they've turned self-righteous. They want to make things harder on younger people. They tell 'em, abstain from sex, say no to drugs; as for the rock and roll, they sold that for television commercials a long time ago...so they could buy pasta machines and stairmasters and soybean futures"</blockquote>
      <p>In Carlin tradition it ends with <i>fuck everybody</i>. But the bit about how political slogans transformed into advertising slogans having the exact opposite meanings is really something.</p>
