魏應充平靜面對有罪判決　列舉5爭議點提非常上訴與再審
06 Nov 2019, 12:51 by 劉志原, 鄒保祥
最高法院審理頂新油品案，今（6日）判魏應充有罪確定，頂新律師余明賢舉行記者會表達強烈遺憾，質疑檢方偵辦此案有三大違失，最高法院卻視而不見，做出具有五大爭議的判決。律師余明賢表示，將聲請再審，另也會針對本案多項違背法令之處，聲請非常上訴。



律師余明賢指出，魏應充一如往常，以非常平靜心情面對此案，也相信司法有公平結果，但今天聽到這樣判決很遺憾。至於是否影響職棒味全龍，余明賢表示，無法代為回答。
律師余明賢強調，最高法院今天判決共有五大爭議，第一點是，刑事訴訟法採無罪推定原則，但二審法院卻在檢察官完全沒有舉證大幸福油品不可供人食用的情況下，直接用推論的方式認定頂新進口的越南油品來源有問題。律師質疑已違反無罪推定原則，最高法院卻未糾正。
第二點是，二審判決認為大幸福公司沒有取得「食品安全證書」，所以油品不具食用品質，律師團認為，越南司法部及農業部都已經發函確認：依越南政府規定，大幸福出口油品不需要取得當地的「食品安全證書」，只須符合進口國規定即可，而當初頂新進口過程一切依衛福部規定，法院卻無視此事實。
律師強調，當初從越南合法進口合格原料油、報關過程政府收取20%食用油關稅，食藥署抽驗進口原料油也合格，最後的成品油更符合國家安全衛生標準。企業一切依法行事，政府規定卻反覆無常，且食藥署朝令夕改、構陷企業入罪，頂新依法進口食用油所繳納的20%食用油關稅仍在政府口袋，如今卻被認定進口油品不具食用品質被判刑。
余明賢律師指出，第三個爭議是，二審判決沒有調查大幸福違反「食品良好衛生規範」的具體情節與程度，就認定油品不可以供人食用，未盡證據調查的義務，最高法院也未糾正二審違法之處，顯有疏失。
第四個爭議是，二審判決以案發7個月後才採樣化驗的頂新油品數值來認定頂新油品欠缺供人食用的品質，但該數值無法證明油品剛熬製時的品質狀態，證據力明顯不足，最高法院仍選擇忽視。
律師強調，第五個爭議點是，檢察官偵查之初，刻意以「趕快釐清責任你就可以回家」、「其他人已經偵訊、把問題推給你」等訊息，誘騙原料油供應商楊振益，取得對頂新不利的證詞，此舉已構成違法取證，最高法院卻未糾正。
律師余明賢強調，近日將依法聲請再審，並就本案違背法令之處，聲請非常上訴。

Wei Yingchong calmly faces guilty verdicts. List 5 dispute points and raise very appeals and retrials.
06 Nov 2019, 12:51 by Liu Zhiyuan, Zou Baoxiang
The Supreme Court heard the case of Dingxin Oil Products. Today (6th), Wei Yingchong was found guilty. The new lawyer Yu Mingxian held a press conference and expressed strong regret. He questioned that the prosecution had three major violations in the investigation. The Supreme Court turned a blind eye and made five major Controversial judgment. Lawyer Yu Mingxian said that he would call for retrial, and he would also appeal to many violations of the law in this case.



Lawyer Yu Mingxian pointed out that Wei Yingchong, as usual, faced the case with a very calm mood and believed that the judicial system had a fair result, but it is regrettable to hear such a judgment today. As for whether it affects the professional baseball and dragon, Yu Mingxian said that he could not answer it.
Lawyer Yu Mingxian stressed that the Supreme Court today has a total of five major disputes. The first point is that the criminal procedure law adopts the principle of presumption of innocence, but the court of second instance directly uses the inference when the prosecutor does not prove that the happiness oil is not available for human consumption. The way to identify the newly imported Vietnamese oil products is problematic. The lawyer questioned that the principle of presumption of innocence had been violated and the Supreme Court did not correct it.
The second point is that the second-instance judgment found that Daxing Company did not obtain the “Food Safety Certificate”, so the oil did not have the quality of food. The lawyers believe that the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Agriculture of Vietnam have sent a letter confirming: According to the Vietnamese government regulations, the big happiness export Oil products do not need to obtain a local ""food safety certificate"", they only need to meet the requirements of the importing country, and the court has ignored the fact that the new import process was in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
The lawyer emphasized that the government legally imported 20% edible oil duty from the legal import of qualified raw oil and the customs declaration process. The Food and Drug Administration also tested the imported raw oil, and the final refined oil was in line with national safety and health standards. Everything in the enterprise is acted in accordance with the law, the government regulations are erratic, and the Food and Drug Administration has changed its order and swindled the enterprise. The tariff of 20% edible oil paid by Dingxin for importing edible oil is still in the government pocket, but now it is determined that the imported oil is not edible. Quality was sentenced.
Lawyer Yu Mingxian pointed out that the third controversy is that the second instance judgment did not investigate the specific circumstances and extent of the “good food hygiene norms” in the case of big happiness, and determined that the oil was not available for human consumption. Correcting the violation of the second instance is obviously negligent.
The fourth controversy is that the second-instance judgment judged the quality of the top fresh oil for human consumption by the value of the new oil sample that was sampled and tested seven months after the incident, but the value could not prove the quality of the oil when it was just cooked. The state, the evidence is obviously insufficient, and the Supreme Court still chooses to ignore it.
The lawyer stressed that the fifth point of controversy is that at the beginning of the investigation, the prosecutor deliberately deceived the raw material oil supplier with the message of ""just clarify the responsibility and you can go home"", ""other people have already investigated and pushed the problem to you"". Yang Zhenyi, obtained testimony against the new top, has constituted illegal evidence collection, but the Supreme Court has not corrected it.
Lawyer Yu Mingxian stressed that he will be called for retrial in accordance with the law in the near future, and he appealed to the court for a violation of the law.
