      <p>The Turner Prize, named after artist JMW Turner, is one of the most prestigious honours for the visual arts in the world and aims to promote public interest in contemporary British art.</p>
      <p>It is awarded to a British artist for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in past 12 months.</p>

      <p>The prize hit headlines earlier this year over the announcement it would be sponsored by bus operator Stagecoach South East.</p>
      <p>It ended its sponsorship “by mutual agreement” just a day after it was made public, following controversy involving the transport company’s chairman.</p>
      <p>Sir Brian Souter unsuccessfully campaigned to keep Section 28, the law which banned teachers and pupils from discussing homosexuality in schools.</p>
      <p>He bankrolled the high-profile Keep The Clause campaign against the Scottish Executive’s plans to scrap Section 28.</p>
      <p>Last year’s Turner Prize was won by artist Charlotte Prodger with her film, shot on an iPhone, about “queer identity” and her experience of coming out as gay in rural Scotland.</p>
