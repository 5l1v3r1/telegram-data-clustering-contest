      <p>Minister Ring said: “I am delighted to announce the successful projects from the second call for funding under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.</p>
      <p>“The fund was established under Project Ireland 2040 to deliver the targeted investment necessary to ensure that rural Ireland continues to grow and prosper and deliver on the balanced regional growth that is in everyone’s interests.</p>
      <p>“Following this announcement, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will have delivered investment totalling €148 million for 110 projects across Ireland, worth a total of €212 million.</p>
      <p>“This funding announced under the first call to the Fund is already transforming rural communities and after today, every county in the country will be benefitting from the investment provided by the Fund.</p>
      <p>“I believe that it is vital that we continue to build resilience in rural communities and make our towns and villages vibrant places for families to live.</p>
      <p>"The projects that this fund supports are targeting areas where they can have the greatest economic and social impact and will help support communities in facing the uncertainty still posed by Brexit.”</p>
