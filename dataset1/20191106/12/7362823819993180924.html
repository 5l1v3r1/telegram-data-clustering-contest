      <p>Dodge has introduced a new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2019-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat-redeye-test-drive-a-miraculous-muscle-car">Challenger</a> Drag Pak race car at the SEMA auto show in Las Vegas. It's the latest in a line of factory-built modern Challengers that began with its 2008 debut and was designed to compete in several NHRA sportsman classes against the likes of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/130g-ford-mustang-cobra-jet-is-the-quickest-most-expensive-pony-car-ever">Ford Mustang Cobra Jet</a> and Chevrolet COPO Camaro. Its production run will be limited to just 50 units.</p>

      <p>Based on the standard narrow-body <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2019-dodge-challenger-srt-hellcat-redeye-test-drive-a-miraculous-muscle-car">Challenger</a>, the Drag Pak is powered by a 354 cubic-inch supercharged HEMI V8 that drives the rear wheels through a manually-shifted three-speed automatic transmission and Strange 9-inch rear end. Dodge hasn't released a power figure for it yet, but <a href="https://www.hotrod.com/articles/1500-hp-mopar-2020-challenger-drag-pak-debuts-sema-2019/">Hot Rod Network reports that it is in the neighborhood of 1,500 hp</a>. The car is also equipped with a roll cage certified for 7.5-second quarter-mile runs, which gives you an idea of just how quick it is.</p>
