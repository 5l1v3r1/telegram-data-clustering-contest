      <p>The US Coast Guard is helping with the search for a missing Air Force airman who fell out of a plane during a jump training mission, Coast Guard Mobile Sector spokesman Juston Lee told CNN.</p>
      <p>The missing staff sergeant deployed his parachute and fell about 1,500 feet into the Gulf of Mexico, he said. His name and age have not been released.</p>
      <p>The crew aboard the C-130 plane said the airman hit the water and was treading water, but when they turned back around to find him, they couldn't see him, Lee said.</p>
      <p>The crew is from Hurlburt Field in Okaloosa County, Florida.</p>
      <p>Multiple teams are continuing the search for the man.</p>
