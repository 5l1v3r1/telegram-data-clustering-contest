      <p>Kaizer Chiefs can expect to come up against a high-spirited Chippa United side in their match tonight, if the latest information from the Port Elizabeth club’s camp is anything to go by. </p>
      <p>Still in search of their first Absa Premiership win of the season, the Chilli Boys will host Amakhosi at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, with newly appointed coach Norman Mapeza knowing very well that anything less than a win for his team will not be good enough in fight against relegation. </p>

      <p>Following their 2-0 loss to Highlands Park in their previous league match, as well as their Telkom Knockout loss to Mamelodi Sundowns in a penalty shootout at the weekend, Chippa say the spirit in their camp is at an all-time high as they get ready to host high-flying Amakhosi. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chippa have confirmed that Thabo Rakhale, Mzikayise Mashaba, and Gregory Damons have all recovered from their respective injuries and are available for selection for the Chiefs clash.</p>
