      <h1>All 79 UK Mothercare Shops to Close</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:30:19+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>The [type of people] who buy [the sort of stuff] from Mothercare will soon have to find another place to buy [whatever it is], as <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/mothercare-bankers-throw-administration-out-of-pram/">the newly-appointed administrator</a> has confirmed that all 79 of the UK branches are to close. There is no emergency, last-minute, probably-Sports-Direct saviour on the horizon, as it's such a loss-maker that no one's mad enough to touch it, not even Mike Ashley after too many massive cups of coffee.</p>
      <p>AdministratorÂ PwC says the UK operation is being sacrificed for the greater good of the international business, as apparently the rest-of-world part of the chain and its businesses are profitable. The UK arm is therefore about to see a "phased closure" of the entire high street estate, leaving around 2,500 permanent and temporary staff out of work, in yet another chapter of the grim pre-Christmas retail horror storybook.</p>
      <p>Mothercare boss Clive Whiley said: "...the board concluded that the administration processes serve the wider interests of ensuring a sustainable future for the company, including the wider group's global colleagues, its pension fund, lenders and other stakeholders."</p>
      <p>The brand may live on as an online retailer, should anyone be up for buying that from the administrator. [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50309542">BBC</a>]</p>
