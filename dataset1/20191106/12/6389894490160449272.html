        <a href="https://www.cityam.com/rmt-union-announces-27-days-of-south-western-railway-strikes-in-december/">RMT union announces 27 days of South Western Railway strikes in December</a>
      </p>
      <p>The strikes will start on 2 December and last until the New Year, with only brief breaks around the 12 December election and Christmas day.</p>
      <p>The Rail and Maritime Transport (RMT) union said the strikes were called because of SWR’s unwillingness to guarantee job security for train guards under a new operational model.</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash said workers were “left with no choice” but to strike.</p>
      <p>The planned industrial action has been heavily criticised by business advocacy groups, who said the strikes will seriously dent Christmas trading for UK businesses.</p>
      <p>Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, said the strikes could not have come at a worst time for high street retailers.</p>
      <p>“The industry is entering a crucial trading period with many retailers requiring a strong Christmas peak to offset a challenging year to date,” he said.</p>
      <p>“With many consumers already holding off from all but essential purchases due to Brexit uncertainty, the associated disruption from transport delays will no doubt put further pressure on sales.”</p>
      <p>CBI chief UK policy director Matthew Fell labelled the strike action as “deeply unfair to businesses, commuters and families in the busy run up to Christmas”.</p>
      <p>While, Federation of Small Business policy chair Sue Terpilowski urged the union and RMT to sort out the strike before it threatened the livelihoods of small business owners.</p>
      <p>“The high cost of doing business in the capital means small firms are already feeling the strain, so a fully functioning transport network is vital to their survival,” she said.</p>
      <h3>Rail strikes show a ‘lack of concern’</h3>
      <p>The dispute revolves around the union’s desire to keep at least one train guard on every train.</p>
      <p>SWR has agreed to this demand in return for the RMT’s agreement to a new operating system.</p>
      <p>However, the union is angry that there are no assurances that the new system will keep the guards into the future.</p>
      <p>Cash said talks had broken down between the groups, leading to the South Western Railway strikes.</p>
      <p>“At the last meeting we held with SWR principles in agreements were made in good faith with the company’s negotiating team and we now feel hugely let down again,” he said.</p>
      <p>“As long as the company continues to refuse to give assurances on the future operational role of the guard we will remain in dispute.”</p>

      <p>A SWR spokesperson said RMT were showing a “lack of concern” for passengers.</p>
      <p>They added: The RMT appear purely focused on keeping control of train doors in a misguided attempt to hold power over the industry.”</p>
