（中央社記者楊啟芳台中6日電）世界12強B組預賽，中華隊先擊退波多黎各，今天將派旅日投手張奕對戰委內瑞拉，對上曾在大聯盟演出無安打比賽的阿瓦瑞茲；若今天中華隊、日本都能奪勝，就確定攜手晉級複賽。
昨天為12強B組預賽第一天賽程，中華隊以6比1擊退波多黎各，日本隊則是以8比4逆轉擊敗委內瑞拉，中華隊及日本隊各有1勝優勢，分組前2名就能晉級複賽。
今天為第2天賽程，晚間6時在桃園棒球場的比賽，由波多黎各對日本，晚間6時30分在洲際棒球場的比賽，則由中華隊交手委內瑞拉。
若中華隊能再奪下1勝，加上日本隊也獲勝，就能提前確定由台灣及日本晉級將於11日開打的東京複賽；若中華隊不敵委內瑞拉，或是日本不敵波多黎各，就要等7日賽程結束才能確定，因此今天2場比賽都相當關鍵。
中華隊推出歐力士猛牛旅日投手張奕先發，雖然他去年才剛棄打從投，不過今年就在日職嶄露頭角，得到一軍先發機會並奪下勝投。
張奕表示，之前沒有對戰過中南美洲的球隊，不過因為上週就接收到要對委內瑞拉先發的通知，已經看了很多情蒐資料，指出對方打者習性「球來就打」，會比較沒有耐心等球，也希望製造速差混淆打者。
委內瑞拉陣中有多名美職體系的選手，攻擊風格多為拉打，其中美職勇士隊3A的布蘭可（Andres Blanco）擁有10年大聯盟經驗，以及今年在墨西哥聯盟敲出31發全壘打的浮耶馬由（Balbino Fuenmayor）都要特別注意。
委內瑞拉則推出阿瓦瑞茲（Henderson Alvarez）先發，他是前大聯盟強投，曾在2013年效力馬林魚時投出無安打比賽。阿瓦瑞茲本季從美職國民隊3A轉戰墨西哥聯盟，在國民3A出賽24場，防禦率5.94；在墨西哥聯盟則是6場先發，防禦率3.12。（編輯：張芷瑄）1081106

06 Nov 2019, 12:59 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Yang Qifang, Taichung, 6th) The world's top 12 Group B preliminaries, the Chinese team first defeated Puerto Rico, today will send a daily traveler Zhang Wei to play against Venezuela, against Avarez who had no play in the big league performance; Today, the Chinese team and Japan can win, and they will definitely advance to the semi-finals.
Yesterday was the first day of the 12 Group B preliminaries. The Chinese team defeated Puerto Rico 6-1. The Japanese team defeated Venezuela by 8 to 4 reversal. The Chinese team and the Japanese team each had a 1 advantage. Can advance to the semi-finals.
Today is the second day of the race, at 6 o'clock in the evening at the Taoyuan baseball stadium, from Puerto Rico to Japan, at 6:30 in the evening at the Intercontinental Baseball Stadium, the Chinese team will play against Venezuela.
If the Chinese team can win another 1 win and the Japanese team wins, it will be determined in advance that Taiwan and Japan will advance to the Tokyo rematch that will start on the 11th; if the Chinese team loses to Venezuela, or if Japan loses to Puerto Rico, It will not be confirmed until the end of the 7th schedule, so today 2 games are quite critical.
The Chinese team launched the Orix Bullfighting Day pitcher Zhang Wei, although he only just abandoned the vote last year, but this year in the Japanese job, he got a chance to start a war and win the victory.
Zhang Wei said that there was no team that had fought in Central and South America before, but since I received a notice to Venezuela for the first time last week, I have read a lot of love information and pointed out that the opponent’s habits ""play the ball"" will compare There is no patience to wait for the ball, and I also hope to create a speed difference to confuse the hitter.
There are a number of players in the Venezuela team, and the attack style is mostly rallying. Among them, Andres Blanco, the 3A of the US Warriors, has 10 years of experience in the big league, and this year, the 31st round of the national league in Mexico. Pay special attention to the Balbino Fuenmayor.
Venezuela launched Henderson Alvarez, a former big league strongman who made a no-hitter game when he played for Marlins in 2013. Avaliz moved from the 3A of the US National Team to the Mexican League this season, playing 24 games in the National 3A with a defense rate of 5.94. In the Mexican League, it was 6 starts and the defense rate was 3.12. (Editor: Zhang Wei) 1081106
