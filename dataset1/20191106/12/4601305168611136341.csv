Danny Elfman is teaching a MasterClass: ""It's okay to fail""
06 Nov 2019, 12:40 by Rusty Blazenhoff



Never have I wanted to learn about creating music for film more than before watching the trailer for Danny Elfman's new MasterClass ($90). In it, he talks about being ""constantly insecure"" despite having over 100 film scores under his belt. But quickly follows up with, ""It's okay to fail."" I mean, that's just solid advice for anyone pursuing creative activities. I appreciate that he goes beyond the ""how-to"" of composing a film score and goes into what it means to be a working artist -- being filled with doubts and insecurities and doing it anyway.
And I think all artists that are worth their anything are filled with doubt all the time. And the few that just don't have any doubt, I think they're destined become-- they could be very successful. They could be good workmen. They could be good craftsmen. But they're not gonna be the really great artists. Because I think doubt and art are kind of combined. They're just-- it's almost impossible to pull them apart doubt. Doubting yourself and then finding confidence and moving forward and then doubting what you've just done and then working through that, I think this is the life of a composer, and I think it's the life of an artist in general. And it's OK to feel that way.
The class is 21 online sessions, including one that's a Nightmare Before Christmas case study. The single class costs $90 or you can get an ""all-access pass"" for $15/month that allows you to watch other MasterClass classes (David Lynch, Penn & Teller, etc.).
From The Simpsons theme to the soundtracks of Tim Burton’s Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Danny Elfman’s compositions are original, memorable, and exuberantly weird. Now the Oingo Boingo founder and four-time Oscar nominee shares his unconventional (and uncensored) creative process. Step into Danny’s studio and learn his techniques for evoking emotion and elevating a story through music.
