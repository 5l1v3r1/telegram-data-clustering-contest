Kaizer Chiefs can expect to come up against a high-spirited Chippa United side in their match tonight, if the latest information from the Port Elizabeth club’s camp is anything to go by. 
Still in search of their first Absa Premiership win of the season, the Chilli Boys will host Amakhosi at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, with newly appointed coach Norman Mapeza knowing very well that anything less than a win for his team will not be good enough in fight against relegation.
