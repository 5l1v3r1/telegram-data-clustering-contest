網紅Youtuber周剛毅經營「我是老爸，我不要當爸！」頻道，擁有40.3萬粉絲訂閱，周今年6月間搭飛機從台北飛往澎湖馬公機場，在飛航期間，竟違規拍攝影片，還上傳Youtube，被警方發現後，依違反《民用航空法》送辦。周到案後也坦承犯行，台北地檢署念他初犯，處分緩起訴，但須支付國庫3萬元。
周剛毅經營的頻道「我是老爸，我不要當爸！」時常分享旅遊相關的影片。他今年6月14日發布一支標題為：「我搭上台灣最危險的飛機？」的影片，片頭他引用網路部落客文章指出，遠東航空有多架飛機超過20年機齡，根據民航局規定，飛機機齡超過26年的飛機不得作為民航機使用，他認為遠東航空的MD82/83可能在1、2年內就會退役，所以他打算搭機體驗看看，接著從行前準備、登機到飛行途中都拍攝紀錄。
影片被警方發現，認為他在飛機上使用攝影器材，違反《民航法》規定，將他移送法辦。周到案後坦承自己在飛機上攝影，表示自己當下想得不夠多，十分後悔犯錯。
台北地檢署檢察官認為，周在飛機關閉艙門後，還使用可干擾飛航及通訊的器材拍攝，犯行明確，但考量他沒有前科，而且已經深感悔悟，因此以違反《民航法》使用干擾飛航及通訊的器材罪，給予緩起訴處分，但須繳納3萬元給國庫。
