      <p>Earlier this year, we shared the news that the folks over at <a href="http://smbmovie.com/">SMBmovie.com</a> had stumbled across new information and never-before-seen deleted scenes for the infamous 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie. We saw our <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/video_super_mario_bros_movie_deleted_scene_surfaces_26_years_after_release">first deleted scene</a> back in August, but now we've been treated to something arguably much more important.</p>
      <p>This new clip clears up one of the film's biggest mysteries, where a very obvious continuity error saw the random appearance of a giant puddle of slime. The issue was that this slime played a pretty major part in the scene, with Koopa slipping in the puddle as the Mario Brothers catch him off guard.</p>
      <p>Now, we can see that the slime comes from one of Koopa's technicians. Koopa catches him sneezing and decides to have him de-evolve into a Goomba, but things don't go according to plan. The new scene starts at around the 1:25 mark in the video below, but you can also hear more about what we just discussed by viewing from the start.</p>

      <p>We can't imagine that there are too many people out there who genuinely enjoy the movie, but we have to admit that it <i>is</i> pretty cool to see all of this footage so many years after its release. More deleted scenes are expected to be shared by SMBmovie.com in the future.</p>
