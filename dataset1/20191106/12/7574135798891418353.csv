Bikini Kill announce 2020 spring tour
06 Nov 2019, 12:09 by Amanda Hatfield


Bikini Kill at Terminal 5 in June (more by P Squared)

We hoped Bikini Kill‘s reunion shows earlier this year weren’t a one-time thing, and sure enough, the band recently announced their first show of 2020, an Olympia, WA charity show on March 13. Now they’ve announced even more 2020 dates; they’ll hit Seattle, Victoria BC, and Portland after playing Olympia in March, and in May they’ll head back out on the road for a longer tour, stopping in Philadelphia, Boston, Montreal, Toronto, and more. They’re also on the lineup for Oslo, Norway’s August OYA Festival.
Tickets for the new dates go on general sale Friday 11/8 at 12 PM Eastern time, with a fan presale starting Thursday 11/7 at 12 PM Eastern. Sign up for the newsletter at Bikini Kill’s site to get the presale code.
Table Sugar, Lithics, and Mecca Normal open the March shows, and May openers are still to be announced. See all dates below.
