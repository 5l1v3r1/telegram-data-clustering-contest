      <p>The best goal you’ve ever seen scored, the best player you’ve had the fortune of seeing play, or your recollection of a momentous sporting moment in history?</p>
      <p>Two charities have teamed up to rekindle the sporting memories of older people in Wishaw and share them with others.</p>
      <p>Chest Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland (CHSS) are providing their community hub in the town’s Main Street as the venue for taster sessions for sporting memories.</p>
      <p>The sessions will help stimulate the minds of residents in the town of a certain vintage as they recall sporting history.</p>
      <p>Throughout this month Sporting Memories Foundation Scotland (SMFS) will be providing a forum to reminisce about sporting heroes.</p>
      <p>Those taking part will also be able to share stories of past playing days, or just share their local or worldly knowledge of sport.</p>
      <p>Sporting Memories clubs are popping across Scotland and supporting older adults to stay active and build friendships through their common love of sport. </p>
      <p>The SMFS is the charitable arm of the award winning Sporting Memories Network, a social enterprise that runs weekly memory groups.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2018 the charity became the first of its kind to use sporting memories to help tackle dementia, depression and loneliness.</p>
      <p>Using images of sport, articles and memorabilia, it supports older people across the country who may have become isolated.</p>
      <p>If the sessions prove successful then it’s hoped a regular club can be launched in Wishaw.</p>
      <p>Both charities are calling on older people with a passion for sport to come along, share their memories, and form a fledgling group with like-minded people to meet weekly.</p>
      <p>The clubs are a great opportunity for older people to become more active and take part in fun indoor games and quizzes.</p>
      <p>Jim Purvis, local co-ordinator for SMFS, said: “We are really excited to launch our newest partnership at a venue at the real heart of the Wishaw community. </p>
      <p>“We believe there are lots of older adults in the area who have a passion for talking about sport and who will benefit from attending a weekly group with like minded people. </p>
      <p>“Our taster sessions give local people a flavour of what we do and hopefully we can establish a weekly club at the venue in the near future. We can’t wait to get started.”</p>
      <p>The taster sessions are free to attend and refreshments are also provided.</p>
      <p>The next session at Chest Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland’s Wishaw hub is on Monday, November 11, from 11am to 12.30pm.</p>
      <p>Volunteers are also being sought to help run the weekly club and an information session is being held on Monday, November 18, from 11am to 12.30pm.</p>
      <p>Full training will be provided to volunteers.</p>
      <p>For more information on the sessions or becoming a volunteer contact Jim Purvis on 07752 436587 or email jim@thesmf.co.uk</p>

      <p>John Whitelaw sees first hand the benefits that sporting memories have for older people.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old, who is Wishaw born and bred, volunteered for the Sporting Memories Foundation Scotland (SMFS) after retiring from his job with the civil service.</p>
      <p>A former junior footballer with Larkhall Thistle, John is helping to get the Wishaw sessions up and running.</p>
      <p>He recalls how he got involved with SMFS in East Kilbride where he lives.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had actually seen a news item on TV about former Scotland and Rangers player Eric Caldow visiting a day care centre and it became apparent that he himself had dementia.</p>
      <p>“Then I was in church and a guy came up to me and said he thought it would be right up my street to volunteer.</p>
      <p>“I’d tried various things I had wanted to do in the community but never really got anywhere. I had a look at it and thought why not.</p>
      <p>“I was encouraged to come along and I’ve never looked back since. I wish I’d loved my job as much as I loved this.</p>
      <p>“I was approached a while ago when it was suggested new groups should be started in Drumchapel and Wishaw and asked which I’d prefer.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t hesitate to choose Wishaw being born and bred there.”</p>
      <p>As well as from his own playing career John has his own football stories as a supporter.</p>
      <p>As a young boy his family stayed through the wall from Motherwell trainer Tommy McKenzie.</p>
      <p>Along with his dad Tommy was one of the main influences on him becoming a Well supporter from an early age.</p>
      <p>“I got loads of memorabilia and as I got a wee bit older even inside information before it hit the newspaper,” said John.</p>
      <p>“I had a love of football from my dad. And Willie McKenzie, Tommy’s brother, stayed across the road.”</p>
      <p>John is already responsible for running two groups in East Kilbride.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just football we talk about at the groups, it’s others sports too” John revealed.</p>
      <p>“We were talking about the rugby the other day with the World Cup being on.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping to get attendees and some volunteers along to help run the Wishaw group.”</p>
