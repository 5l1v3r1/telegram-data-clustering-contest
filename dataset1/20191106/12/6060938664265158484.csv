After the massive success of the popular track 'Teri Mitti' from his film 'Kesari' earlier this year, Akshay Kumar is all set to make his first music video appearance, collaborating with Punjabi singer B Praak. Titled 'Filhall', the music video will feature Kriti Sanon's sister and debutant Nupur Sanon opposite Akshay.
The makers of the song have dropped the teaser of the melody. The song features a heart-wrenching love story essayed by Akshay and Nupur. The lyrics of the beautiful ballad is penned by lyricist Jaani.



Talking about the collaboration, Akshay had told ETimes, “Having experienced the magic of B Praak’s voice firsthand with Teri Mitti from my film Kesari, there was not much needed to convince me to come onboard for ‘Fillhal.’ And to top it off the lyrics are so beautiful, it’s impossible to not feel anything. When I met with the lyricist, Jaani he told me it’s his best written song till date and I couldn’t agree more. This brilliant combination of a soulful voice and lyrics to match got me to make my music video debut.”
Meanwhile, on the professional front, Akshay has his kitty full with interesting projects like 'Good Newwz', 'Sooryavanshi', 'Laxmmi Bomb' and 'Bachchan Pandey'.
