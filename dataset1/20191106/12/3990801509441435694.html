      <h1>Dormant Bitcoin whale holding 80K BTC could crush the market, analysts warn</h1>
      <h2>... but is the owner even alive?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T12:13:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">David Canellis</a></address>
      <p>Cryptocurrency analysts have warned that early adopting Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> whales still have “plenty of clout” when it comes to dictating market prices.</p>
      <p>Those behind Twitter-based transaction monitor <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert">@whale_alert</a> have noted that an apparently dormant Bitcoin address houses almost 80,000 BTC ($750 million), and if the owner decides to sell them all, it could spell utter devastation for the industry.</p>
      <p>“That address alone — if that is actually a whale who’s been holding their coins for so long without doing anything with them — if they decide, ‘Okay, let’s go sell them,’ it would crush the market completely,” Whale Alert told crypto prime dealer SFOX in a recent interview.</p>
      <p>“But it’s really hard to say anything about the status of that address: Are those keys lost? Is that person even still alive? […] It’s just waiting to see if anything happens with those addresses,” they added.</p>
      <p>A list of top dormant Bitcoin whale addresses (in which no outflowing Bitcoin has been detected in at least five years) <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-dormant_5y-bitcoin-addresses.html">can be found here</a>.</p>
      <h3>The ‘Bitcoin whale effect’ has been demonstrated before</h3>
      <p>It’s plausible that the power of Bitcoin whales has been demonstrated recently. Whale Alert told SFOX that between August 29 and September 6 2018, a cryptocurrency whale unloaded around $1 billion worth of Bitcoin after they moved the funds from a single wallet to exchanges.</p>
      <p>When most of the Bitcoin from the wallet was sold, the price of Bitcoin dramatically dropped by almost 15 percent, and the 30-day rolling volatility increased by almost 25 percent.</p>

      <p>Another example is the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/16/hundreds-charged-after-takedown-of-child-exploitation-site-which-made-730k-in-bitcoin/">recent closure</a> of a darknet child abuse imagery ring in South Korea. Police confiscated a massive amount of Bitcoin from the perpetrators, which were eventually auctioned.</p>
      <p>Whale Alert managed to track 10,000 BTC ($94 million) during the auction, which were likely sent to cryptocurrency exchange Binance for selling.</p>
      <p>“Almost directly after that big transaction, the price of BTC dropped,” said Whale Alert. This seems to be corroborated by Binance‘s order book, which shows a rise in volume just a few hours after the auction.</p>
      <p>An eventual BTC selloff drove the price of Bitcoin on Binance from $8062.56 to $7856.89.</p>

      <p>It’s worth noting, however, that these kinds of movements are often localized to one particular exchange – in this case, Binance.</p>
      <p>However, when such large, inactive Bitcoin addresses exist, one can’t help but wonder what the markets would look like if dormant whales one day awoke with a sudden urge to capitulate.</p>
