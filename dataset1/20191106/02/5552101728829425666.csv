【不只是二代店】席捲IG的時髦台菜茶館　永心鳳茶明年進軍東京
06 Nov 2019, 02:57 by 李莘于, 彭仁義
近年，有股從南台灣掀起的餐飲旋風席捲全台，這個源自高雄海鮮餐廳「老新台菜」的新品牌「永心鳳茶」，在執行長薛舜迪的規劃下，以新台茶沙龍為概念揮軍北上，橫掃IG網紅界。
圓拱牆面、車廂式卡座包廂、馬賽克拼貼磁磚，台中百年車站台洋混和的巴洛克式風華，都被收攏在勤美誠品三樓的「永心鳳茶」中，不誇張，店裡沒有一刻是冷清的。














穿著有型有款的薛舜迪，是餐飲世家第三代，從小跟著總鋪師父親進出熱油滾燙的廚房，一開始父親要他回來接班，他老大不願意，「念書的時候比較崇洋媚外，覺得西餐比較帥嘛，但開始做了之後，漸漸覺得有為自己國家推廣的感覺，其實我們本土的東西，對外國人來說也是很國際化。」














他特別提起一個小故事，有回他到高雄一家有名的鴨肉飯吃飯，看到一位日本遊客捧著雜誌慕名而來，但汗流浹背的吃兩口就走了，「我覺得這碗飯是好吃的，那是不是有什麼地方沒有滿足到他？當他們大老遠的來，願意花3、400元消費，你為什麼只拿3、40塊的東西給他呢？」
有了這層認知，他認為台菜的空間還很大，好比整體風格氛圍的營造，好比與茶的搭配。「在老新台菜時，經常被外國觀光客問：哪裡可以喝茶？」薛舜迪心想，年輕人不喝茶，不表示台茶沒市場，而是「沒有一間屬於這個世代的茶館讓他們走得進來。」











第一件事，就是用冷泡茶來切入，將茶裝瓶放進高腳杯裡，利用器形來聞香，喝茶變成品茶，「很多人說很假掰啦，但我覺得是茶一直被低估了，我想藉由設計展現茶應有的價值。」即使是做一杯珍珠奶茶，都結合了阿里山高山、南投阿薩姆與台東紅烏龍三種紅茶來煮，茶韻特別悠長濃厚。








考量茶館的經濟模式，薛舜迪融合了本業台菜，從正餐到小食，可以把人一整天都綁在這兒。針對每間分店選擇的品項也不同，台北南西店鄰近大稻埕，就有青蒜魷魚、排骨酥等酒家菜，而台中店以中部特色飲食為核心，如砂鍋魚、甜辣醬炒麵及鴨肉飯。
主廚詹智偉表示，雖然看似小吃，但所有食材都往上升級，好比沙茶醬、辣醬自己調、小卷自己殺、鴨油自己煸，炒麵使用紅糟伊比利豬，鴨肉飯使用低溫烹調的豪野鴨。看似網美，但吃了一口就能感受到扎實的硬功夫。














新潮到位的設計概念，已吸引許多海外的目光，明年永心鳳茶即將進軍日本，而今年底，薛舜迪又將有新品牌「心潮飯店」入駐信義區，結合炒飯與雞尾酒吧，他所掀起的台菜時髦文化革命才正要開始。

[Not just the second-generation store] The trendy Taiwanese teahouse that swept IG Yongxin Fengcha entered Tokyo in the next year.
06 Nov 2019, 02:57 by Li Yuyu, Peng Renyi
In recent years, a whirlwind of food and beverages from South Taiwan has swept across Taiwan. This new brand, ""Yongxin Fengcha"", which is derived from Kaohsiung's seafood restaurant ""Lao Xintai Cuisine"", is based on the plan of the new Taiwan Tea Salon under the planning of CEO Xue Yudi. The army marched north and swept the IG network red world.
The arched wall surface, the carriage-type deck box, the mosaic tile tile, the baroque style of the Taichung Centennial Station and the Taiwan-Pacific station are all gathered together in the ""Yongxin Fengcha"" on the third floor of Qinmei Eslite, no exaggeration, shop No moment is deserted.














Xue Yudi, who is wearing a model, is the third generation of the family of food and beverage. He followed the father of the master shop and entered the hot and hot kitchen. At the beginning, his father asked him to come back to work. His boss didn’t want to, ""when he was studying, he was more admired. Western food is more handsome, but after I started doing it, I gradually felt that I had the feeling of promoting it for my country. In fact, our local things are also very international for foreigners.""














He especially mentioned a small story. He went back to a famous duck rice meal in Kaohsiung. He saw a Japanese tourist holding a magazine, but he sweated and ate two. He said, ""I think this bowl of rice is good. Eat, is there any place that does not satisfy him? When they come all the way, willing to spend 3,400 yuan, why do you only give 3 or 40 pieces of things to him?""
With this layer of cognition, he believes that the space of Taiwanese food is still very large, just like the creation of the overall style atmosphere, like the match with tea. ""When I am cooking, I am often asked by foreign tourists: Where can I drink tea?"" Xue Yudi thought that young people don't drink tea. It doesn't mean that Taiwanese tea has no market, but ""there is no teahouse belonging to this generation."" Come in.""











The first thing is to use cold tea to cut in, put the tea bottle into the goblet, use the shape to smell the tea, and drink tea into tea. ""Many people say it is fake, but I think it is tea. It has been underestimated. I want to show the value of tea by design.” Even if it is a cup of pearl milk tea, it combines three kinds of black teas: Alishan Mountain, Nantou Assam and Taitung Red Oolong. The tea is particularly long. strong.








Considering the economic model of the teahouse, Xue Yudi has integrated the Taiwanese cuisine. From dinner to snacks, people can be tied here all day. The items selected for each branch are different. The Taipei Nanxi store is adjacent to Dadaojing, and there are restaurants such as green garlic squid and pork ribs, while Taichung is centered on the central specialties such as casserole, sweet and spicy sauce and duck. rice.
Chef Zhan Zhiwei said that although it looks like a snack, all the ingredients are upgraded, such as sand tea sauce, spicy sauce, tune, self-killing, duck oil, chopsticks, red rice, Iberian pig, duck rice, low temperature Cooked wild duck. It looks like Net Beauty, but you can feel solid hard work after taking a bite.














The design concept of the new wave has attracted many overseas eyes. Next year, Yongxin Fengcha will enter Japan. At the end of this year, Xue Yudi will have a new brand “Xinchao Hotel” to settle in Xinyi District, combining fried rice and cocktail bar. The fashionable cultural revolution is just about to begin.
