        <b>TEL AVIV (Sputnik) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would not let the Iranian regime to build nuclear weapons, following Tehran's announcement to expand its uranium enrichment efforts.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Given Iran’s efforts to expand its nuclear weapons program, expand its enrichment of uranium for making atomic bombs, I repeat here once again: We <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911061077232598-expansion-of-uranium-enrichment-activities-by-iran-is-nuclear-extortion---us-state-dept/">will never let Iran develop nuclear weapons</a>. This is not only for our security and our future; it’s for the future of the Middle East and the world", Netanyahu said, as quoted by the Times of Israel newspaper.</blockquote>
      <p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has announced that the country would start on Wednesday injecting gas into centrifuges at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant at the level of 5 percent, an activity that was previously banned under the deal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the president stressed that the decision was reversible and Iran would suspend gasification as soon as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signatories complied with their commitments.</p>
      <p>Under the JCPOA, Iran is supposed to repurpose its Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant as a centre for the production of stable isotopes, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911051077231405-iran-announces-it-will-start-enriching-uranium-to-5-at-fordow-site-on-6-november/">refraining from enriching uranium</a> and leaving Natanz as the only uranium enrichment facility.</p>
      <p>Iran started the third stage of rolling back nuclear obligations under the JCPOA in September. The gradual reduction of the obligations was announced on 8 May, the first anniversary of the US' unilateral pullout from the 2015 pact.</p>
      <p>Tehran then announced that it would start abandoning some parts of its nuclear obligations every 60 days unless European signatories to the deal <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911041077224491-iranian-fm-slams-us-sanctions-against-general-staff-as-useless/">ensured Iran's interests</a> amid Washington’s reinstated sanctions.</p>
