Press Metal’s agreement with Sarawak Energy expected to boost capacity
06 Nov 2019, 02:26 by AmInvestment Bank
Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd(Nov 5, RM4.67)Maintain hold with an unchanged fair value (FV) of RM3.83: The Sarawak state government yesterday proposed a 1% state sales tax on the exports of aluminium products starting from January 2020, as part of its plan to increase the state government’s revenue.
Based on our estimates, the new tax will cost Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd RM64 million and RM89 million in financial year 2020 (FY20)-FY21F (forecast), eroding our FY20–FY21F net profit forecasts by 6%-8% and lowering our FV by about 7% to RM3.54 (based on the same 18 times earnings multiples).
We are keeping our earnings forecasts for now as we believe the company is in the midst of seeking clarification from the state government on the matter.
Meanwhile, we maintain our assumption on: i) aluminium average selling price of US$1,800-US$2,000 per tonne for FY19-FY21F on the back of higher projected production growth of 6%-7% versus projected consumption growth of 5% in China in 2019; and ii) alumina price of US$390-US$430 per tonne backed by the prevailing supply shortage in global alumina production.
We remain cautious about Press Metal as: i) earnings outlook for aluminium smelters globally is still cloudy due to the weak aluminium price and high cost of input alumina, resulting in margin squeeze; and ii) the company’s valuations are at a premium versus its global peers which means the upside to its share price may be capped.
However, this is mitigated by Press Metal’s recent signing of a 15-year power purchase agreement with Sarawak Energy Bhd for the supply of 500MW of electricity, enabling it to power an additional annual aluminium smelting capacity of 320,000 tonnes. This will boost its overall smelting capacity by 42% to 1.08 million tonnes by 2021 from 760,000 tonnes currently
We reiterate our “hold” call, forecasts and FV of RM3.83 based on 18 times FY21 earnings per share, which is at a premium to the 10 times average forward price-earnings of key global aluminium smelters to reflect Press Metal’s favourable cost structure with the bulk of its energy cost (from hydro power) locked in at very competitive rates over the long term. — AmInvestment Bank, Nov 5
