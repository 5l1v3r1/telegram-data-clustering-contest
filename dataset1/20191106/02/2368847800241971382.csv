法擊斃非洲激進組織2號人物 反恐之路仍未告終

06 Nov 2019, 02:52

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】法國5日(週六)宣布在非洲國家馬利擊斃激進武裝組織「伊斯蘭和穆斯林支持組織」（GSIM）第2號人物、摩洛哥人阿里梅舒，但也表示，擊斃組織核心人物雖大力撼動這些恐怖團體，但不代表這些激進組織會自行瓦解。
法國國防部長帕利（Florence Parly）表示，在馬利部隊和美軍支援下，法國10月8日晚間擊斃多國通緝名單中的阿里梅舒（Ali Maychou）。
她說，阿里梅舒是西非沙赫爾（Sahel）地區僅次於GSIM首腦阿克蓋里（Iyad Ag Ghaly）的第2號恐怖分子，美軍也曾搜尋他的蹤跡。
帕利說：「深度瓦解這些（叛亂）活動非常重要，但這不代表這些組織將會自行消失。」

GSIM是由幾個與伊斯蘭北非蓋達組織（AQIM）有掛鉤的團體組成。阿里梅舒在2012年加入AQIM後，與阿克蓋里共同成立GSIM，負責策劃這個組織在沙赫爾地區的擴張，並聲稱在沙赫爾地區犯下多起大規模攻擊。
G5沙赫爾國家組織（G5 Sahel）由馬利、查德、布吉納法索、茅利塔尼亞及尼日爾等5國聯合組成，有5000人的反恐武力；法國則承諾支援這個脆弱的區域。但儘管在法國、非洲鄰國和聯合國的幫助下，馬利軍隊一直窮於應付伊斯蘭叛亂活動，激進分子發起一連串致命暴力攻擊奪走了數以百計人命，更凸顯了這個地區的脆弱。
本月1日，激進分子在靠近馬利與尼日爾（Niger，另譯尼日）邊境的梅納卡（Menaka）地區因代利曼（Indelimane）前哨基地擊斃49名馬利軍人，與伊斯蘭國有關的好戰分子宣稱犯下這起最新攻擊；2日又有兩名馬利軍人與一名法國軍人喪命。
帕利造訪馬利北部城市加奧（Gao）時曾表示：「在2020年前，歐洲國家特種部隊將與法國特種部隊一起部署在馬利，向馬利軍隊傳授卓越的專業知識。」

Law kills African militant group No. 2 The road to terrorism is still not finished

06 Nov 2019, 02:52

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] France announced on the 5th (Saturday) that the African country, Mali, killed the militant group ""Islamic and Muslim Supporting Organization"" (GSIM) No. 2, Moroccan Ali Messo, However, it also said that although the core figures of the killing organization vigorously incited these terrorist groups, it does not mean that these radical organizations will disintegrate on their own.
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said that with the support of the Marley and the US military, France killed Ali Maychou on the night of October 8 in the list of wanted countries.
She said that Ali Messo was the No. 2 terrorist in the Sahel region of West Africa, second only to GSIM leader Iyad Ag Ghaly, who also searched for his tracks.
Parry said: ""It is very important to deeply disintegrate these (rebellion) activities, but this does not mean that these organizations will disappear on their own.""

GSIM is made up of several groups linked to the Islamic North African Al-Qaeda Organization (AQIM). After joining AQIM in 2012, Ali Messo co-founded GSIM with Akgary to plan the expansion of the organization in the Shahr area and claimed that many large-scale attacks were committed in the Shahr area.
The G5 Sahel is composed of five countries including Marley, Chad, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger, with 5,000 anti-terrorist forces; France is committed to supporting this fragile region. . But despite the help of France, African neighbors and the United Nations, the Marley army has been poorly coping with the Islamic insurgency. The radicals launched a series of deadly violent attacks that claimed hundreds of lives and highlighted the fragility of the region.
On the 1st of this month, militants killed 49 Marley soldiers in the Menaka area near the border of Mali and Niger, in the Indelimane outpost, related to the Islamic State. The militants claimed to have committed this latest attack; on the 2nd, two other Marley soldiers died with a French soldier.
When Palley visited the northern city of Gao in the city of Mali, he said: ""Before 2020, the European National Special Forces will be deployed with the French Special Forces in Mali to impart outstanding expertise to the Marley Army.""
