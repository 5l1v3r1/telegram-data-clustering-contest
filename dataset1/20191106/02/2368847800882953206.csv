習近平送大禮 換來馬克龍當面批評

06 Nov 2019, 02:49

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】北京「送大禮」換取法國總統馬克龍出席在上海舉行的進博會，然而，中共的「大撒幣外交」未能平息馬克龍的不滿。他在開幕式上當面批評習近平，指中共的開放跟其貿易夥伴長期不對稱，並警告北京若不改變將遭到報復。
11月5日，第二屆中國進口博覽會（進博會）在上海開幕，馬克龍是唯一到場的西方大國領導人。去年第一屆進博會召開時沒有一個西方大國首腦出席。
本屆進博會，除了法國，只有塞爾維亞、牙買加和希臘向上海派遣了政府首腦，其它國家只是派去了部長級官員。
這次隨馬克龍訪華的法國企業共有40多家，包括空客集團、歐萊雅、蘇伊士等15家大型企業。在進博會開幕前一天，馬克龍宣布，他將與習近平和中共總理李克強正式會談，法中將簽署40多項經貿合同，涉及領域有航空、能源、農副產品等。
自由亞洲電台表示，這40多項合同是北京請馬克龍為進博會站台的代價。儘管如此，中共的「大撒幣外交」並未能阻止馬克龍對北京當局公開表示不滿。
5日上午，習近平在開幕式上致辭，承諾繼續對外開放，還強調「中國是一個守信的國家」。然而，外界對此大多表示質疑。
馬克龍顯然對此也不認同，他在開幕式上當面批評習近平，指不少外國政府和商業團體對中共的改革承諾均持懷疑態度。
他還表示，外國政府和商業團體曾長期警告，如果中共的開放跟其貿易夥伴長期不對稱，中共將招致貿易夥伴的報復。
馬克龍說，中共需要進一步開放中國國內市場，而法國希望出口更多肉類產品到中國。
今年3月，習近平曾訪問法國，親自上門送大禮，但同樣未能打消馬克龍的疑慮。據法新社報導，習近平訪法期間，北京和法國簽署了包括購買290架A320和10架A350空客飛機，總計約為400億歐元的合同。
而馬克龍在與習近平會面前公開表示，在對待中共的問題上，「歐洲的天真時代已經結束了」。歐盟已改變對華政策，將中共定性為「系統性競爭對手」。
此外，馬克龍還罕見地未與習近平進行一對一會談，而是邀請了德國總理默克爾（Angela Merkel）和歐盟委員會主席容克（Jean-Claude Juncker），在巴黎愛麗舍宮一同會見習近平，為習舉行了一次特別的「四方會談」。
有分析稱，馬克龍此舉令北京想要對歐洲各國「逐個擊破」的招數失靈。德媒《法蘭克福匯報》的報導稱，馬克龍不想要繼續容忍中共在歐洲的擴張路線，希望北京會理解德法併肩站立信號的意義。
日媒《每日新聞》則披露，在四方會談過後，馬克龍對習近平表示：「希望尊重歐盟的團結。」他還特別重複了在歐盟峰會期間的那句話：「我們都不天真。」
此次馬克龍在香港民主抗爭期間訪華，引起外界關注。他曾表示，將在訪華期間使香港成為「一個非常坦率而真誠的討論話題」。另有法國官員也表示，馬克龍與中國領導人會面時，不會迴避香港及新疆問題。
據悉，馬克龍與習近平定於11月6日在北京正式會面。

Xi Jinping sent a gift in exchange for Mark Long’s face-to-face criticism

06 Nov 2019, 02:49

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Beijing ""send a gift"" in exchange for French President Mark Long to attend the Expo in Shanghai. However, the CCP's ""big currency"" diplomacy failed to quell the dissatisfaction of Mark Long. At the opening ceremony, he criticized Xi Jinping in person, referring to the long-term asymmetry between the CCP's opening and its trading partners, and warned that Beijing would be retaliated if it did not change.
On November 5th, the 2nd China Import Expo (Jingbo Fair) opened in Shanghai. Mark Long was the only leader of the Western powers. At the time of the first Expo in China last year, no Western leader of the country attended.
In addition to France, only Serbia, Jamaica and Greece sent government heads to Shanghai. Other countries only sent ministerial officials.
There are more than 40 French companies that have visited China with Mark Long, including 15 large companies including Airbus Group, L'Oreal and Suez. On the day before the opening of the Expo, Mark Long announced that he would formally hold talks with Xi Jinping and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. The law will sign more than 40 economic and trade contracts covering aviation, energy and agricultural and sideline products.
Free Asia Radio said that these 40 contracts are the price of Beijing’s request for Mark Long to enter the Expo. Despite this, the CCP’s ""large currency exchange diplomacy"" failed to prevent Mark Long from expressing public dissatisfaction with the Beijing authorities.
On the morning of the 5th, Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the opening ceremony and promised to continue to open to the outside world. He also stressed that ""China is a trustworthy country."" However, the outside world has mostly questioned this.
Mark Long apparently disagreed with this. He criticized Xi Jinping in the opening ceremony and pointed out that many foreign governments and business groups were skeptical about the CCP's reform commitments.
He also said that foreign governments and business groups have long warned that if the CCP's opening is long-term asymmetric with its trading partners, the CCP will incur retaliation from trading partners.
Mark Long said that the CCP needs to further open up China's domestic market, while France hopes to export more meat products to China.
In March of this year, Xi Jinping visited France and personally delivered a gift, but it also failed to dispel the doubts of Mark Long. According to Agence France-Presse, during Xi Jinping’s visit to France, Beijing and France signed contracts for the purchase of 290 A320 and 10 A350 Airbus aircraft, totaling approximately 40 billion euros.
In the face of Xi Jinping, Mark Long publicly stated that on the issue of the CCP, ""the innocent era in Europe is over."" The EU has changed its policy toward China and characterized the CCP as a ""systemic competitor.""
In addition, Mark Long did not have a one-on-one meeting with Xi Jinping. Instead, he invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to meet with Xi Jinping at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Xi held a special ""four-party talks.""
Some analysts said that Mark Long’s move made Beijing want to fail to “smash one by one” in European countries. According to the report of the German newspaper ""Frankfurt Report"", Mark Long does not want to continue to tolerate the CCP's expansion route in Europe. He hopes that Beijing will understand the significance of the German and French side-by-side signals.
The Japanese media ""Daily News"" disclosed that after the Quartet talks, Mark Long told Xi Jinping: ""I hope to respect the unity of the EU."" He also repeated the sentence during the EU summit: ""We are not naive.""
This time, Mark Long visited China during the democratic struggle in Hong Kong, causing concern. He has said that during his visit to China, Hong Kong will become ""a very frank and sincere discussion topic."" Another French official also said that when Mark Long met with Chinese leaders, he would not avoid the problems of Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
It is reported that Mark Long and Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Beijing on November 6.
