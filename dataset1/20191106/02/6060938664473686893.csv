Micro review: 'Weapons of Kalki: The Book of Love' by Ritika Kochhar
06 Nov 2019, 02:30 by TIMESOFINDIA.COM
The first part of the Weapons of Kalki trilogy, 'The Book of Love' sets the scene for a lovely new mytho-fiction series.
Set in the 1960s and 1970, this book follows a young couple whose child is predicted to be Kalki, the bringer of change and the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. Vishnuvyas Takur is a doctor by profession from a political family whose teenage dreams came true when he married Princess Parvati of Arjungarh whom he had liked since their schooldays. The Princess had been previously married but neither that nor her daughter from her first marriage impact his love for her. However soon after their marriage evil forces, the Daughters of Mara, try to harm their new family.
The book is good for even those who aren't familiar with Hindu mythology for it provides context for all the references within. Well written with lovely insights on politics, religion and tradition, the book is an interesting read. It starts slow but ends on an almost cliffhanger which will leave readers eager for the next part of the series.
