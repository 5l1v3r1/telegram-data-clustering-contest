      <p>Nintendo abandoned first-party game support for the Wii many years ago, but to this day third-party publisher Ubisoft has continued to release its <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/just_dance">Just Dance</a></b> series on the system. The latest one – <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/just_dance_2020">Just Dance 2020</a></b> – arrived <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/just_dance_2020_launches_today_on_switch_and_wii_heres_the_full_song_list">yesterday</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, all good things must come to an end, and it now sounds as if Ubisoft will finally be dropping support for this particular generation of Nintendo hardware. According to a PR, Just Dance 2020 will be the last entry in the series for Wii. Ubisoft apparently went as far as saying it would be the last Wii game <i>ever</i> released.</p>

      <p>While it's obviously up to Ubisoft to decide if this is the last Just Dance game for the system, there's no saying this will necessarily be the <i>final</i> Wii game ever released. Perhaps it could claim to be the last major third-party release on the system, but in the current age of classic systems receiving new games all the time, there's no saying there won't be another game released on this console in the near future.</p>
