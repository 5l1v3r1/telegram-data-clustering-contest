【賴神挺洪姐】盧秀燕愛將PK洪慈庸？　傳比照「韓國瑜模式」請假帶職參選
06 Nov 2019, 02:41 by 黃揚明
台中市第3選區（潭子、大雅、神岡、后里）立委選將除了爭取連任的現任立委洪慈庸，已表態參選的還包括台灣民眾黨提名的張睿倉。國民黨雖然還沒正式徵召人選，但上次選戰中被洪慈庸擊敗的台中市副市長楊瓊瓔一直勤跑基層，可望在國民黨最後一波提名中被徵召參選。
地方傳出，楊瓊瓔將比照韓國瑜模式，被徵召後將以請假方式帶職參選，而不會比照去年新北市長侯友宜先宣布辭副市長後再投入選戰的方式。對此，楊瓊瓔透過幕僚回應：「我現在是台中市副市長，目前的工作就是把市政工作做好，要以市政為重，我一直以來就是喜歡做實事的人，這點台中鄉親都很清楚。」
至於何時宣布參選，楊瓊瓔說，目前按照黨中央的規劃是11月13日徵召提名她參選，「身為一個黨員，我尊重黨中央的安排」。至於帶職參選還是請辭，楊僅表示：「該怎麼做就怎麼做。」
台中地方人士透露，洪慈庸8月時民調落後楊瓊瓔超過20％，但近幾個月已逐漸拉近距離，把民調差距拉到只剩個位數。因此近期藍營網軍也開始在網路散布批洪言論，可見選情越來越激烈。

[Lai Shen quite Hong sister] Lu Xiuyan loves PK Hong Ciyong? Passing the ""Korean Yoga Mode"" for a leave of absence
06 Nov 2019, 02:41 by Huang Yangming
In the third district of Taichung City (Tanzi, Daya, Shengang, Houli), the legislators selected Hong Chiyong, the current legislator for re-election, and Zhang Ruicang, who was nominated by the Taiwan People’s Party. Although the Kuomintang has not officially recruited candidates, Yang Qiong, deputy mayor of Taichung City, who was defeated by Hong Ciyong in the last election, has been running the grassroots level and is expected to be called for the final wave of nominations in the Kuomintang.
When the locals came out, Yang Qiongyi will compare the Korean Yu model. After being called, he will take the job as a leave of absence. Instead of following the announcement of the deputy mayor of New Taipei Mayor Hou Youyi, he will enter the election. In response, Yang Qiongyi responded through the aides: ""I am now the deputy mayor of Taichung City. The current job is to do a good job in the municipal work. I want to take the municipality as the most important thing. I have always been a person who likes to do practical things. This is very clear to the Taichung folks. ""
As for when to declare the election, Yang Qiongqi said that according to the plan of the Party Central Committee, on November 13, she was called to nominate her to stand for election. ""As a party member, I respect the arrangements of the Party Central Committee."" As for the job-election or resignation, Yang only said: ""What to do if you do it.""
According to local people in Taichung, Hong Ciyong’s polls were more than 20% behind Yang Qiong’s in August, but in recent months they have gradually narrowed their distance and pulled the poll gap to only a single digit. Therefore, the recent Blue Camp Army has also begun to disseminate criticisms on the Internet, showing that the election is getting more and more intense.
