‘Hope to see you soon!’: Lisa of K-pop group Black Pink is new face of Filipino clothing brand Penshoppe
06 Nov 2019, 02:18 by Coconuts Manila
“Mabuhay, Philippines!” Thai rapper, singer, and K-pop phenom Lalisa Manoban — better known by her mononym Lisa — greeted her Filipino fans today, confirming rumors that she’s the new ambassador of the Filipino-owned global clothing brand Penshoppe.
For those who’ve never heard of Lisa, or her girl group Black Pink, try being 10 years younger. Failing that, you can also briefly browse this YouTube dance compilation of the South Korean girl group member performing various twirls, pop-locks, and graceful limb extensions. She has a deeply devoted fanbase, which explains why that video alone has over 45 million views.
Black Pink is relatively new to the K-pop scene, having debuted their first album Square One in 2016. Despite their newbie status, their 2019 single “Kill This Love” has become a favorite on Spotify and on YouTube, where it has over 640 million hits.



In the ad posted to Penshoppe’s Facebook page, Lisa conveys to Filipino fans her excitement about being the newest face of the clothing brand, adding, “I had so much fun shooting this campaign, I hope you guys love it, too.”
She name-dropped Penshoppe’s social media handles, urging fans to stay tuned, then closed the short video by teasing, “Hope to see you soon!”



Though no details have been disclosed about her Manila visit yet, Penshoppe — one of the country’s oldest clothing brands, around since the ’80s — has used many foreign celebs over the years for their billboards and campaigns.
They include pop star Mandy Moore (2003), actor Zac Efron (2012), models Cara Delevigne and Gigi Hadid (2014 and 2016, respectively), and actress/model Paris Jackson, the daughter of the late pop star Michael Jackson (2018).
The clothing brand is known for its youth-oriented, go-to “everyday fashion” and affordable trends.

Penshoppe is at Alabang Town Center, Ground Level, Alabang, Muntinlupa

Open 10am-10pm and in many branches across the country
