The £3.10 dish originally launched in August, however it sold out in two weeks and was only just reintroduced on Sunday.
Friends of Mr Davis described his death as 'senseless', while police called it 'pointless'.


The suspect was accompanied into the branch by this woman



The pair allegedly fled the car park after the stabbing

 
Police Chief Hank Stawinski said: ""Something we have to question in terms of how we're interacting with one another as a society, is how does a confrontation over cutting line lead to a death.
""People are asking how something so pointless could occur. This is pointless, this is disrespectful and that's why I'm asking for the community's help.""
Mr Davis suffered a single stab wound and was rushed to hospital, however he died 51 minutes later.
