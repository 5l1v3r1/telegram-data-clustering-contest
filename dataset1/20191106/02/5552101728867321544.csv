韓國人氣選秀綜藝《PRODUCE X 101》製作人安俊英昨（5日）遭韓國警方逮捕，與節目其他兩名工作人員和STARSHIP副社長在接受偵辦後遭禁止出境。而晚上傳出安俊英確定收押，根據韓媒晚間新聞報導，《PRODUCE X 101》製作人曾接受經紀公司招待，在首爾江南區聲色場所花費上百萬韓元花天酒地。
安俊英製作人製作了《PRODUCE X 101》四季節目，從中選出11名優勝者組成限定組合出道，從I.O.I、WANNA ONE、IZ*ONE到最新的X1，成功打造出四組優秀組合，但第4季的比賽結果卻遭質疑，爆出票數造假的黑箱作業，粉絲上報到青瓦台申訴，要求公權力介入調查真相，而經過檢方與警察調查後，確認至少有2到3名成員是「保送出道」。
警調將不僅止於調查《PRODUCE 101》全系列有無弊端，連同製作人等曾製作的節目都將重新審查。據韓媒報導，安俊英曾多次在江南的聲色場所接受經紀公司款待，警方已聲請扣押搜查，但可能無法直接證明宴請的經紀公司是否與投票有關。另外還爆出警方查出安俊英在票數造假事件爆發後，試圖銷毀手機等證物的行為。
