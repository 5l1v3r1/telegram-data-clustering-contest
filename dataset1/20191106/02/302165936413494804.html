      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 ― The ringgit slipped at the opening today on lack of demand for the local currency amid the lower crude oil price, said a dealer.</p>
      <p>At 9.10am, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1320/1350 against the greenback from 4.1290/1320 recorded yesterday.</p>
      <p>The crude oil price is currently trading at US$62.75 per barrel, down by 0.33 per cent.</p>
      <p>The dealer said the firmer US dollar was moved by the US consideration to remove some tariffs it imposed on Chinese goods as a concession into securing phase one trade deal with China.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign the interim trade deal this month.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of other currencies, the ringgit traded higher.</p>
      <p>It rose versus the Japanese yen to 3.7894/7929 from 3.7929/7960 on yesterday’s close and was marginally higher against the Singapore dollar at 3.0400/0434 from 3.0443/0476.</p>
      <p>The local note increased against the British pound to 5.3220/3263 from 5.3248/3290 and strengthened to 4.5741/5779 from 4.5952/5989 vis-a-vis the euro. ― Bernama</p>
