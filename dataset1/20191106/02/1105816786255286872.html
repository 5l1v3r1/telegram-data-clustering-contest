      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Energy demand in Pakistan has created highly profitable opportunities for Swiss companies to invest in renewable, hydel and clean technology power generation projects, said President Arif Alvi.</p>
      <p>Talking to the Council of States of Swiss Confederation President Jean Rene Fournier on Tuesday, he pointed out that there were immense investment opportunities in research and innovation to increase productivity and profitability in crops, dairy, seed production and biotechnology sectors.</p>
      <p>“Industrial growth has sparked massive demand in all facets of Pakistan’s air, sea, rail and road and physical infrastructure,” he said. “Apart from this, there is immense potential in development of tourism infrastructure in the country and Swiss firms can explore these investment opportunities.”</p>
      <p>The president emphasised that Pakistan valued its long-term partnership with Switzerland in economic, trade and commercial fields.</p>
      <p>He further added that the trade volume between the two countries had been increasing steadily although it did not commensurate with the actual potential.</p>
      <p>Appreciating Swiss investment in Pakistan, he said that the government’s business-friendly policies were bearing fruit as Pakistan climbed 28 places in the ease of doing business index this year.</p>
