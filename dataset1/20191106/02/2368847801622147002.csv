「元朗疑凶」何君堯屯門遇刺 中刀過程曝光

06 Nov 2019, 02:41

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】被外界視為7.21元朗恐襲幕後黑手的香港親共立法會議員何君堯，6日早上遭人刺傷送院。港人懷疑何是玩「苦肉計」，又想造假拉票。
據多家港媒稱，11月6日早上8點左右，親共立法會議員何君堯，於屯門啟豐園商場地下擺街站時遇襲，施襲者當場被捕。警方表示，何君堯被可疑人斬傷，他清醒時由救護車送院治理。
根據網上片段，事發時一名身穿藍衫及戴鴨舌帽的男子，手持鮮花走向何君堯，並表示支持何君堯，其間何與對方握手及接過鮮花。並說：「多謝你，好有心。」
戴鴨舌帽男問能否與何君堯合照，何說可以，對方於是伸手入袋內取出黑色長刀，刺向何，場面非常混亂，該名戴鴨舌帽男被多人制服在地面。何君堯遇襲後，沒有離開，反面繼續幫忙制服施襲者。
其間施襲者不斷高叫：「何君堯去死！何君堯揼佢！何君堯你個賊！」「你個人渣！」有在場人士高叫報警。
警方稱，事件中共有3人受傷，包括施襲者及何君堯與何的助理。目前事件仍在調查中。

對於何君堯被斬，香港網友非但沒有同情反倒一片嘲諷：
「仲欠白衣人尾數未找惹的禍」、「一滴血都見唔到，博同情，又想造假拉票？」「何妖做戲，妖樑三日」、「苦肉計，自己搵人斬自己」、「黑社會互斬，好平常，小事一件」。
「這麼輕傷不是自導自演？ 民主派議員和示威者被鐵鎚敲頭，咬斷耳朵，斬到腸掉出來的呢？你又不提？」
何君堯被外界認為是7.21元朗恐襲幕後黑手，同時也被稱為「西環（中聯辦）契仔」。

7月21日43萬香港人再次走上街頭反對「送中條例」，當晚10点左右，數百名白衣黑幫手持長棍鐵棒藤條等武器，衝進西鐵元朗站大堂及地鐵車廂內無差別襲擊市民。
除了圍毆記者、議員之外，連老弱婦孺、孕婦都不放過，白衣黑幫行凶兩小時，車站內外到處充滿斑斑血跡，受傷民眾慘叫聲一片。
事件至少造成45人受傷，其中3人傷勢嚴重、1人命危。但姍姍來遲的港警並未拘留白衣凶徒，反而隔絕了記者、讓這群白衣黑幫從容離去。
事發後，網絡上曝光的多條視頻片段顯示，何君堯曾與多名白衣人握手，並豎起拇指稱「辛苦你」、「你們是我英雄」。
有消息稱，中聯辦是此恐襲血案的幕後黑手，何君堯涉嫌在背後下達「動員令」，命令鄉黑勢力行動，而港警則與黑幫暗中勾結，共同實施了此次恐怖襲擊。
何君堯因此成為示威者的「公敵」，他的辦事處被破壞。9月18日，他名下馬匹「天祿」將參與賽馬比賽，網友發起包圍馬場「慶賀」何君堯的活動，馬會考慮安全問題取消比賽。
但網友質疑，馬會讓何君堯的馬退賽即可，為何因一匹馬而取消整場賽事。面對港人的責問，何君堯不但否認與黑幫勾結，還組織不同勢力打壓抗議人士。

9月21日，何君堯又發起「清潔香港運動」，號召3萬名大陸人和親共港人，撕毀全港90處地方的連儂牆，以迎接中共建政70年。
此舉招來港人的一片譴責聲，迫於壓力，何君堯隨後在其社交網站facebook發文，宣稱「不會清理連儂牆，只會清理街道垃圾」。
但港人不領情，有人打印了近千張何君堯的肖像，鋪在西鐵朗屏站通往朗屏邨的行人天橋地上任人踩踏。期間不少市民駐足圍觀，成為當地一景。
據悉，何君堯的肖像上面還寫有咒罵他的話，諷刺他「官黑勾結」、「何妖作惡」等，天橋柱上也有何的肖像，部分更寫有「壽終正寢」，被設計成靈堂模樣。
10月下旬，英國上議院議員奧爾頓勳爵（Lord Alton of Liverpool）去信安格裡亞魯斯金大學（Anglia Ruskin University，ARU），指何君堯在元朗事件中與黑幫握手，發表有關「大屠殺」、將示威者形容為「曱甴」（蟑螂）等言論，要求ARU撤銷何的榮譽博士學位。ARU是何的母校。
10月28日，英國安格裡亞魯斯金大學發聲明，宣布撤銷何君堯榮譽博士學位的決定。
之後，英國保守黨人權委員會副主席班尼迪克·羅哲斯（Benedict Rogers）發推文指，包括奧爾頓勳爵在內的數人，收到來自一名何君堯「爪牙」的電郵，稱會對他們「以眼還眼、必死刀下」。
羅傑斯形容，這恐嚇電郵，「符合中共政權的特質」。
10月29日，香港民研計劃發放新一輪特首及政府民望、立法會議員民望及民情指數，結果顯示市民對何君堯的認知率最高，但其支持度卻是最低，只有17.1分，支持度最高的議員是民主黨鄺俊宇有59分。

""Yuanlang suspected"" He Jun slammed the knife in the process of exposure

06 Nov 2019, 02:41

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] He Junyi, a Hong Kong pro-Communist legislator who was regarded as a black-handed attacker behind the scenes, was sent to the hospital on the morning of the 6th. The Hong Kong people suspected that they were playing the ""bitter plan"" and wanted to make fake tickets.
According to several Hong Kong media, at about 8:00 am on November 6, the pro-Communist legislator He Junyi was attacked at the ground floor of the Qifengyuan shopping mall in Tuen Mun. The attackers were arrested on the spot. The police said that He Junyi was injured by a suspicious person. He was sent to the hospital by an ambulance when he was awake.
According to the online clip, a man wearing a blue shirt and a cap was holding a flower to He Junyi at the time of the incident, and expressed support for He Junyi, during which he shook hands with the other party and took over the flowers. And said: ""Thank you, good heart.""
The man wearing a cap asked if he could take a photo with He Junyi. He said yes, the other party then reached into the bag and took out the black long knife. The scene was very confusing. The man wearing the cap was subdued on the ground. After He Junyi was attacked, he did not leave, and he continued to help the uniform attackers.
In the meantime, the attacker kept yelling: ""He Junyi is going to die! He Jun is a channel! He Jun is a thief!"" ""You personally slag!"" Some people present called the police.
Police said that three people were injured in the incident, including the attacker and He Junyi and his assistant. The current incident is still under investigation.


The online clip shows what the attacker took with the flowers when the incident occurred, and expressed support for it, during which he shook hands with the other party and took over the flowers. The attacker suddenly took a long knife from his pocket and inserted it into He Junyi. (synthetic picture)

For He Junyi being defamed, Hong Kong netizens not only have no sympathy but a mockery:
""The blame for the number of people in the white is not looking for a disaster."" ""A drop of blood is seen, Bo sympathizes, and wants to make a fake canvassing?"" ""He demon plays, demon three days"", ""bitterly, self-deprecating yourself"" ""The underworld is a good thing, it's a normal thing, a small thing.""
""So a minor injury is not self-directed? Democrats and demonstrators are knocked at the hammer, biting their ears, and falling into the intestines? You don't mention it?""
He Junyi is considered by the outside world to be behind the scenes of the 7.21 Yuen Long raid. It is also known as the ""Western Ring (China United Office).""


The pictures taken by the reporters on the spot clearly show that the white man is holding a long stick and an iron branch and standing beside the riot police. (video screenshot)

On July 21, 430,000 Hong Kong people once again took to the streets to oppose the ""Send Regulations"". At about 10 o'clock that night, hundreds of white gangs armed with long sticks and rods and rattans rushed into the West Rail Yuen Long Station lobby and subway car. There is no difference in attacking the public.
In addition to the encirclement of journalists and parliamentarians, even the old and the weak women and the pregnant women did not let go. The white gangs were murdered for two hours. The inside and outside of the station were full of blood stains, and the injured people screamed.
At least 45 people were injured in the incident, 3 of them were seriously injured and 1 was fatal. However, the late arrival of the Hong Kong police did not detain the white murderers, but instead isolated the reporters and let the white gangs calmly leave.
After the incident, a number of video clips exposed on the Internet showed that He Junyi had shaken hands with many white people and cocked his thumb to say ""hard work"" and ""you are my heroes"".
It is reported that the Liaison Office is behind the scenes of this terrorist attack. He Junyi was suspected of issuing a ""mobilization order"" behind him, ordering the black forces to act, and the Hong Kong police colluded with the gangs to jointly carry out the terrorist attack.
He Jun became a ""public enemy"" of the demonstrators and his office was destroyed. On September 18th, his horse ""Tianlu"" will participate in the horse race. The netizens will launch an activity to surround the horse race ""Celebrate"" He Junyi. The horse will consider the safety issue to cancel the competition.
However, netizens questioned that the horse would let He Junyi’s horse retired, why the whole event was cancelled because of a horse. In the face of the responsibilities of the people of Hong Kong, He Junyi not only denied collusion with the gang, but also organized different forces to suppress the protesters.

On September 21, He Junyi launched the ""Clean Hong Kong Campaign"", calling on 30,000 mainlanders and pro-Hong Kong people to tear up the walls of 90 places in Hong Kong to meet the 70 years of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party.
The move attracted a condemnation from the people of Hong Kong. Under pressure, He Junyi subsequently published a letter on his social networking site, claiming that ""it will not clean up the wall and only clean up the street garbage.""
However, the people of Hong Kong did not appreciate it. Someone printed nearly a thousand portraits of He Junyi and laid on the grounds of the footbridge leading to Longping Village on the West Rail Longping Station. During the period, many citizens stopped to watch and became a local scene.
It is reported that the portrait of He Junyi also has a curse on him. He satirizes his ""official black collusion"" and ""he demon evil"". There are also portraits on the pillars of the bridge. Some of them are also written as ""end to sleep"" and are designed to look like a hall.
In late October, Lord Alton of Liverpool, a member of the British House of Lords, wrote to Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), pointing out that He Junyi shook hands with the gang in the Yuen Long incident and published a The massacre, the demonstrators described as ""曱甴"" (蟑螂) and other remarks, asked the ARU to cancel the honorary doctorate. ARU is the alma mater.
On October 28, the University of Anglia Ruskin University issued a statement announcing the decision to revoke the honorary doctorate of He Junyi.
Later, Benedict Rogers, vice chairman of the British Conservative Party Human Rights Committee, said that several people, including Lord Alton, received an email from a ""Knife"" of He Junyi, saying For them, ""an eye for an eye, a knife will die.""
Rogers described this as an intimidation to the e-mail, ""consistent with the traits of the Chinese Communist regime.""
On October 29, the Hong Kong Citizenship Research Institute issued a new round of special heads and government expectations, Legislative Council members' expectations and public sentiment index. The results showed that the public had the highest recognition rate for He Junmai, but its support was the lowest, only 17.1 points. The highest-ranking member is the Democratic Party, Jun Junyu has 59 points.
