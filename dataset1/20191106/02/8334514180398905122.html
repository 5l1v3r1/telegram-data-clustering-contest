      <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asia’s largest bank DBS (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/DBSM.SI">DBSM.SI</a>), Swiss commodities trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] and their partners have started a blockchain trading platform in Singapore aimed at reducing paperwork and improving trade flows, the bank said.</p>
      <p>The first trade to be carried out on the ICC Tradeflow platform will be a cargo of iron ore worth $20 million to be shipped from Africa to China this month, DBS said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The platform is built on Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority’s (IMDA’s) network infrastructure and Perlin’s blockchain technology, DBS said.</p>
      <p>The International Chamber of Commerce is also a partner in this project, the bank added.</p>
      <p>“By tapping into each other’s respective expertise in commodities and finance, our customers will be able to receive their goods at least 50% faster with much less paperwork,” said Tan Su Shan, head of institutional banking at DBS.</p>
      <p>All parties on the blockchain platform will also be able to send, receive and act upon trade instructions in real time, cutting the end-to-end trade document transit time by more than half from 45 to 20 days, the bank said.</p>
      <p>More enhancements will be made to the platform including trade finance on-the-go, providing background information and credit ratings on trade participants, vessels and couriers to build trust among counterparties, DBS said.</p>
