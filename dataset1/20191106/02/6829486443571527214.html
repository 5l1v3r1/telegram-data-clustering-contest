      <h1>Please Enjoy David Harbour Being Totally Unable To Say The Word ‘Grandma’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T02:34:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 02:34</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Today is officially <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/stranger-things"><i>Stranger Things</i></a> Day, which is apparently a holiday that began last year, but which I only found out about something like 20 minutes ago.</p>
      <p>But that’s fine. There is no point quibbling over where this day came from, or whether we should allow a brand to turn their own content into a national day, because the gifts of <i>Stranger Things </i>Day are many — chief amongst them blooper footage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harbour">David Harbour</a> being utterly unable to say the word “grandma”.</p>
      <p>Yep, turns out that Harbour, who was launched into worldwide fame thanks to his performance as the extremely loveable Detective Jim Hopper in <i>Stranger Things</i>, just can’t speak that word without turning into a melted puddle of giggles.</p>
      <p>Valiantly, the man tries some six or seven times, becoming more hysterical with each attempt. For their part, Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard just sit there, kinda aghast.</p>
      <p>Basically it’s a work of extraordinary comedic art, and deserves to be watched in full right now:</p>

      <p>What further delights will <i>Stranger Things</i> Day bring us, I wonder? At the very least, the writers’ room for the show have already promised us some bloopers on the horizon. That sounds like reason enough to keep celebrating, I reckon.</p>
