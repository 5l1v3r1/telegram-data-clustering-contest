      <h1>Trevor Lawrence's TikTok doppelganger freaks out social media, Clemson QB responds</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/clemson-tigers">Clemson</a> quarterback Trevor Lawrence was already one of the top players in the nation, but now his popularity is reaching new heights on the social media platform TikTok, thanks in part to a lookalike who doesn't even play football.</p>
      <p>Lawrence, who led the Tigers to a national championship last season as a freshman, partially went viral earlier this week with the help of a young woman who some say bears a resemblance to him. The hilarious video has been viewed thousands of times on TikTok and even garnered a response from the quarterback.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of those,” Lawrence told reporters when he was asked about the TikTok woman, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ToddSummers7/status/1191412107633258496">WSPA-TV</a>. “It’s crazy. That one girl actually does look like me. It’s kinda crazy but it’s funny.”</p>

      <p>Clemson’s official TikTok account also posted their own video with the woman and Lawrence side-by-side. In a separate video, the woman appeared to be shocked that Lawrence responded to her videos.</p>
