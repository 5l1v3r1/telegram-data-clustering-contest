AFTER receiving the Seal of Good Local Governance, the Navotas City Government garnered trophies and cash prizes from the Department of Health (DoH) for its exemplary public health programs.
Mayor Toby Tiangco personally received the awards for Best in Oral Health Program, Best in Tuberculosis Control Program and Best in Lifestyle-related Diseases Prevention and Control Program during the DoH-National Capital Region Gabi ng Parangal Monday evening.
The city received P300,000 per award or a total of P900,000 in total, which will be used as additional funding for said health services.
“We are honored to receive recognitions for our health programs. Awards, however, are only secondary to our ultimate goal of providing the best service we could give to our constituents,” Mayor Toby Tiangco said.
“We are glad that our public health programs have been proven effective. Yet, we also recognize that we need to constantly improve our services to ensure the well-being of our people,” he added.
Navotas achieved 69% out of the 100% national target for the number of orally-fit children 12-71 months old, the highest among LGUs in Metro Manila. The city used the dental bus donated by DoH to entice young Navoteños to have their teeth checked and treated.
