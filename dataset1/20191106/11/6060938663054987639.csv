Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan had B-town buzzing when they shared a rare family photo that saw them sharing the frame with their kids Suhana, Aryan and AbRam.
While the click came as a delight to fans across the globe, it was SRK who came up with the best and cheekiest reply. Sharing the photo, he said, “Over years I made a good house...Gauri made a good Home but I really believe we are the best at making some really good kids!""



Although it was hard to outdo daddy Khan’s comment, it was Mahira Khan, Sussanne Khan and Farah Khan’s cute comments that also caught our attention.
Mahira, who romanced SRK in ‘Raees’, had all heart-eyes for the “genes” the kids shared.
Bff and fellow interior designer Sussanne seemed bowled over by the click that prompted her to say, “Stunners!! All of you.”
Farah, on the other hand, commended the parents, saying, “Gauriiiiii U hav done very well!! Look at these gorgeous children.”



SRK and Gauri recently completed twenty-eight years of marriage and continue to give other famous B-town couples like Priyanka Chopra-Nick Jonas, Anushka Sharma-Virat Kohli and others tough competition.
While the two have often kept their private lives out of the media glare, of late their photos together on social media send flutters around town.
