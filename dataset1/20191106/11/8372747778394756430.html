      <p>ODESSA, Fla. -- A Florida man is facing an aggravated assault charge after he admitted shooting at the wrong vehicle after he thought another driver was trying to kill him.</p>
      <p>24-year-old Dakota Haber was arrested Tuesday night at the Swan View Townhomes complex in Odessa.</p>
      <p>According to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report, Haber and another driver had gotten into a road rage confrontation at the front gate of the complex around 8:40 p.m. Both drivers got back into their vehicles and entered the complex.</p>
      <p>A short time later, Haber believed he saw the other driver following him, so he got a handgun out of his vehicle and fired five shots at the suspected vehicle from more than 50 yards away.</p>
      <p>That driver turned out to be somebody else who wasn't involved in the original altercation. They sustained minor injury from shattered glass when three of the shots hit their vehicle.</p>
      <p>Haber was arrested and taken to the Land O' Lakes detention facility.</p>
