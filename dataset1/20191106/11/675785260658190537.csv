Every Arsenal manager candidate rated and slated as Unai Emery's job remains under threat
Unai Emery impressed then chief executive Ivan Gazidis and was handed the job ahead of seven other candidates

Unai Emery blew his competition out of the water when he interviewed for the Arsenal job following Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign.
The Spaniard impressed then chief executive Ivan Gazidis in his interview by arriving with a pamphlet containing information on every first-team Arsenal player, detailing his findings on them and plans to help them improve.
He also explained how he's a hands-on boss who trawls through videos of previous performances to fix minute problems - something Wenger never did.
Things started positively for the Spaniard, but Emery is under pressure a little over a year on from his appointment, and other managers are being linked with his job.
Here we look at the managers Emery fended off in the first place.
Mikel Arteta

Pros: Knows the club like the back of his hand, has watched the best manager of a generation, Pep Guardiola, win back-to-back Premier League titles.
Cons: Has no experiencing in football management, let alone the team the size of Arsenal.
Patrick Vieira

Pros: Is a club legend so would lift the team, has experience managing in two countries.
Cons: Hasn't pulled up any trees at Nice. Before overseeing victory over Reims last Sunday the Ligue 1 club lost three matches on the trot.
Thierry Henry

Pros: One of the most popular names at Arsenal whose presence would lift the club and perhaps more importantly the fans.
Cons: Has had just one stint in management at Monaco, and things didn't work out for him. Danger of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer situation occurring at Arsenal with his appointment.
Massimiliano Allegri

Pros: Proven cup-winner having tasted title glory once with AC Milan and then five times on the trot with Juventus.
Cons: Dominated with the best team in the league - not unlike Emery at PSG - but, unlike Emery, failed to achieve much in European competitions.
Julen Lopetegui

Pros: Experienced manager who is used to working closely with youngsters, having lead Spain's Under-19s and Under-21s to European titles.
Cons: Showed disloyalty to his country ahead of the World Cup and failed when in charge of a big club like Real Madrid.
Ralf Rangnick

Pros: A progressive boss who has won trophies in two different countries with three clubs. Works well promoting youth players and has a clear philosophy.
Cons: Is yet to test himself at a big club, which comes with the added responsibility and pressure.
Jorge Sampaoli

Pros: The Argentine is an incredibly experienced manager, who punched above his weight while in charge of Sevilla.
Cons: Struggled managing the superstars of his national team and eventually left by mutual consent following a poor 2018 World Cup run.
