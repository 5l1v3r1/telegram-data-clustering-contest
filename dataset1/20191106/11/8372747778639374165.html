      <p>PASCO COUNTY, Fla. -- A Florida man has been charged with battery after deputies say he hit a teenage driver in the head for driving too close to him.</p>
      <p>61-year-old Stephen Grosso was arrested Tuesday in Wesley Chapel.</p>
      <p>According to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report, Grosso exited the passenger side of a vehicle and displayed what appeared to be a gold police badge. He approached the 16-year-old driver of a vehicle behind him and complained to her that she was driving too close to his vehicle.</p>
      <p>He then reached into the vehicle and struck the girl on the forehead with the badge, then left the scene.</p>
      <p>When deputies interviewed him at his home, Grosso admitted to hitting the girl, and said he didn't know why he did it.</p>
      <p>Deputies say the badge was a Christian affiliation badge.</p>
