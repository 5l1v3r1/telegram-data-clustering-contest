      <h1>Leigh Griffiths pictured at Celtic training ahead of Lazio showdown as striker readies himself for comeback</h1>
      <h2>Neil Lennon is lacking in attackers so could the Scotland star make an appearance in Rome?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:54:48+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Cooney</a></address>
      <p>Celtic striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> has been pictured training ahead of the club’s crucial clash in Rome.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old took part in a full session at Celtic Park as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s squad prepare to fly out for the Lazio showdown later on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It’s a major boost to Lennon’s attacking options as of last week he had just one fit striker to call upon in Odsonne Edouard following a knee injury to Vakoun Bayo.</p>
      <p>Griffiths hasn’t featured for the champions since a 3-1 victory over Hearts in late August. Following his personal problems the former Hibs star has been hit with niggling injuries and a virus.</p>
      <p>He dropped a major hint he’s ready to return earlier this week when he posted a "guess who’s back" message on social media.</p>

      <p>And now Griffiths is edging ever closer to a comeback by joining the rest of the squad at the stadium for their final training session before taking on the Serie A giants in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a>.</p>
      <p>He was named in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> ’s European squad list for the competition in which Lennon’s side are top of their group.</p>
      <p>The feel-good factor is high right now following a convincing win over Hibs at Hampden on Saturday to book a Betfred Cup Final place against Rangers.</p>
      <p>The club also revealed this morning Callum McGregor has signed a new five-year deal. Scott Brown looks to be next in line for a new contract.</p>
