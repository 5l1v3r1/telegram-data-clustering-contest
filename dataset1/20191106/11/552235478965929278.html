      <h2>Shame on 'greedy council" as they penalise Betty Weir from beyond the grave</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:01:54+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Houston</a></address>
      <p>She lived in Ayr for no less than 88 years – but her family have now been charged DOUBLE to inter her remains back in the <br/>old town.</p>
      <p>Betty Weir moved into care in East Ayrshire and was ruled not to be local anymore.</p>
      <p>Now her family have savaged the harsh policy of South Ayrshire Council as it emerged they operate a postcode lottery.</p>
      <p>And her daughter Marylyn said: “We saved them a fortune as East Ayrshire Council provided part of the care fees.</p>
      <p>“Now the greedy beggars have hit us in the pocket.</p>
      <p>“It is a real slap in the face and we want the rules changed for other families.</p>
      <p>“This is outrageous – and Betty would be very angry about this.</p>
      <p>“Born and bred in Ayr does not mean a thing to greedy South Ayrshire Council.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to a female employee and all she would say is, ‘It’s just the way it is.’</p>
      <p>“We want this indecent charge scrapped for other families. This is not about the money, it is about principal.”</p>
      <p>Her ashes were interred in the family plot at Ayr Cemetery, alongside her husband Jackie, who was a well-known bus driver.</p>
      <p>The usual cost is £186 – but Betty’s family was charged £372.</p>
      <p>Her son-in-law Ron Fraser said: “After 88 years of living in Ayr, this is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“East Ayrshire do not do this, they don’t charge double if you are living in the wrong postcode.”</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Betty, who died aged 90 in July, spent her career on the counters of Hourstons department store.</p>
      <p>She finally left her home in Main Road, Whitletts, two years ago for sheltered housing in Kilmarnock, to be nearer to her daughters Marylyn and Elaine.</p>
      <p>Betty was the youngest of six children and is survived by a sister who is now aged 99.</p>
      <p>She didn’t move to Kilmarnock until December 2016, before moving to a care home in Fenwick in 2017.</p>
      <p>Incredibly this week South Ayrshire Council refused to back down.</p>
      <p>And seemed to say that if they had shelled out for care fees they would have cancelled the extra charge.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: ”Our policy states that non-residents are charged a 100% surcharge for burial or internment of cremated remains.</p>
      <p>“If the person has lived out of the area for under two years, or South Ayrshire Council have contributed to any Nursing Home fees, then the extra charge is waived.”</p>
