      <h1>SoftBank's Son admits mistakes after Vision Fund's $8.9 billion loss</h1>

      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9984.T">9984.T</a>) plunged to its first quarterly loss in 14 years on Wednesday, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at its giant Vision Fund, as CEO Masayoshi Son admitted poor investment judgment and turning a blind eye to problems at startup WeWork.</p>

      <p>The scale of the loss shows the risks in Son’s strategy of splashing out big on cash-burning startups. It has also cast a pall on his efforts to raise a second massive fund.</p>
      <p>WeWork’s spectacular flame-out this year has sparked questions about Son’s judgment in backing unconventional tech founders such as WeWork’s Adam Neumann. SoftBank was forced last month to spend more than $10 billion to bail out the office-sharing startup after its IPO attempt flopped.</p>
      <p>“My investment judgment was poor in many ways and I am reflecting deeply on that,” Son, 62, told a news conference following the results. It was a remarkable admission for an executive well known for his ebullience.</p>

      <p>He said he had turned a blind eye to problems with Neumann in areas such as corporate governance. Nevertheless, Son was defiant that WeWork was still a solid business, saying there would be a “hockey stick” recovery in its profits eventually.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Group Corp said its $100 billion Vision Fund contributed an operating loss of 970 billion yen ($8.9 billion) during the July-September quarter, and an unrealized loss of 537.9 billion yen for the six months of the year as the value of its tech bets such as WeWork and Uber Technologies (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/UBER.N">UBER.N</a>) tumbled.</p>
      <p>Overall, the group posted an operating loss of 704 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in the July-September quarter compared to a 706 billion yen profit in the same period a year earlier and a 48 billion yen loss forecast by analysts, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>SoftBank said the combined loss on its directly held shares in WeWork and WeWork shares held by the Vision Fund amounted to $8.2 billion.</p>

      <h3>DEBT FOCUS</h3>
      <p>The results are likely to put a renewed focus on SoftBank’s considerable debt pile. It has more than $51 billion in outstanding bonds, and another $36 billion in bank loans. Its weighted average cost of debt is 3.7%, the seventh-highest among all companies on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, according to Refinitiv data. Both Moody’s and S&amp;P rate its debt as junk.</p>
      <p>The Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund, which is run by ex-Deutsche Bank banker Rajeev Misra, had invested $70.7 billion in 88 companies at the end of September. Those investments are now worth $77.6 billion excluding exits, it said.</p>
      <p>With increased market scrutiny over the path to profitability for many of its bets on unproven startups, Son was also more cautious about the timings of IPOs - an essential step to unlock capital to keep its investment juggernaut growing.</p>
      <p>Son said he expected the second Vision Fund to go ahead as scheduled, and at a similar size to the first fund, but he declined to provide an update on negotiations with investors.</p>

      <p>The value of most of the fund’s listed investments, including Uber, Slack Technologies (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/WORK.N">WORK.N</a>) and Guardant Health (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GH.O">GH.O</a>) fell over the quarter.</p>
      <p>At Uber, that slide has continued as losses mount and a post-IPO share lock-up ends, with its shares hitting new lows this week.</p>
      <p>SoftBank’s investing activities are propped up by other pillars of Son’s empire including domestic telecoms operator SoftBank Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9434.T">9434.T</a>), which on Tuesday reported a 9% rise in second-quarter operating profit, beating estimates, buoyed by its cash-cow mobile business.

      <p>SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.</p>
