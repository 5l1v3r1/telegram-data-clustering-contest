      <p>A haul of The Prodigy star Keith Flint's most prized possessions are set to go under the hammer at an auction on Thursday following his death in March.</p>
      <p>His treasured belongings are part of a sale at Cheffins in Cambridge and include a custom-made gothic bed worth £20,000, his famous double cone septum nose piercing and a gold chest of drawers.</p>
      <p>Many of his belongings, divided into more than 170 lots, will be offered to help settle his estate's debts.</p>
      <p>The star owed roughly £7.3 million in debts and taxes when he died at the age of 49 at his Essex mansion earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The sale reflects the frontman's personal taste in art and fashion, as well as his interests in music and beyond.</p>

      <p>Keith's bespoke 'mythical creature' bed with supportive steel thorned branches is also up for sale as well as his famous motorbike leathers and helmet.</p>
      <p>Flint owned motorcycle team Team Traction Control, which won three Isle of Man TT races in 2015 and competed in the British Supersport Championship.</p>

      <p>One of the most eye-catching pieces from Flint's collection is a wooden head replica of the singer himself.</p>
      <p>The statement statue represents Keith's iconic punk personality and acts as a symbol of his 1990's fame in the Brit Award-winning electronic band.</p>
      <p>Auctioneer Martin Millard recently revealed: "The items highlight the difference between Keith’s stage persona and his private life.</p>
      <p>"Valuing items with such provenance is almost impossible, and therefore we will not be publishing any pre-sale estimates, but expect there to be lots to cater to most budgets."</p>

      <p>The much-loved singer was found dead at his home in Essex on March 4 this year, aged 49.</p>
      <p>A coroner later ruled there was not enough evidence to confirm the musician took his own life.</p>
      <p>Details from the Probate Office show the frontman had significant debts at the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Keith Flint collection will be going under the hammer on Thursday, November 7, from 6pm at the Cheffins sale room.</b>
