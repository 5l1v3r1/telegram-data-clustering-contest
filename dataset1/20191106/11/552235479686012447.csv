He’s a man of both community and conservation.
Privately he will admit it was a very emotional moment as he stood before his Queen.
Mark Gibson, the Laird of Craigengillan Estate at Dalmellington, received his OBE last week in the splendour of Windsor Castle.
He was been honoured for his heritage work as a Dumfries House Trustee and founder of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory on his land.
Mark has already said the honour was recognition for Dalmellington and Bellsbank as well.
Last week Mark revealed he chatted with Her Majesty about Ayrshire at the Investiture ceremony within the Waterloo Chamber.

Mark is pictured above without his tails, back on familiar ground at Craigengillan.
She carefully pinned his OBE insignia to his left lapel.
He said: “We talked briefly about Dumfries House and then the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory.
“She was incredibly well briefed and knowledgeable and knew all about Dalmellington and how important both projects were to East Ayrshire.
“And I am happy to say I do think things are beginning to look up in this area.”
