      <p>LONDON — <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/emilia-clarke/">Emilia Clarke</a> says she would have tried her hand at online dating if she wasn’t an actor. </p>
      <p>The <i>Game of Thrones</i> star admitted she was once “definitely tempted” about trying out dating apps.</p>
      <p>“There was a time. I was definitely tempted. (I missed online dating) because I was on people’s television right when it all began. So there are all my single friends being like (swiping). </p>

      <p>“I’m like, ‘What are you doing?’ ′ Shopping for a boyfriend.′ ‘OK cool.’ If I wasn’t in the job I’m in, then I definitely would do it, 100%. And I feel like it’s not a taboo anymore,” Clarke told the <i>Daily Mirror</i> newspaper.</p>
      <p>The actor said good sense of humour and kindness were some of the qualities she was looking for in a man.</p>
      <p>“If you make me giggle, then I’m in pretty much. And someone who is considerate and nice. Like when someone takes you out on a date and they’ve thought about kind of an interesting thing to do ... that goes a long way. But a sense of humour is 100% it. If you can laugh with someone, it’s just the sexiest thing in the world,” she said.</p>
      <p>Clarke previously dated actor Seth MacFarlane and filmmaker Charlie McDowell, whom she split with earlier this year.</p>
