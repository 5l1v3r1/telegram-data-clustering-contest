THE Philippine National Police is stepping up its drive to stop violence against women through a massive public awareness program aimed at further educating the public on the need to fully observe women’s rights.
According to PNP Directorate for Police-Community Relations director Maj. Gen. Benigno Durana Jr., they are empowering the  men in uniform to be actively involved in government effort to topple all forms of discrimination and violence against women.
Durana yesterday led the opening ceremony of the 6th Men Opposed to Violence Against Women Everywhere (MOVE) PNP Summit, with the theme: “VAW Free Community Starts with Me,”
The official said they envision a VAW-free society, where men take an active role in eliminating violence against women. Studies show that men are mostly the perpetrators of VAW.
Aside from the summit, the PNP conducts various activities such as lectures, workshops, fora, radio/TV interview and other MOVE activities aimed at promoting the advocacy among all police personnel, encouraging them to join and become actively involved in the advocacy to eliminate violence against women in our society.
