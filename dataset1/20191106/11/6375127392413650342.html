      <h3>THE Philippine National Police is stepping-up its drive to stop violence against women thru a massive public awareness program aimed at further educating the public on the need to fully observe women’s rights.</h3>
      <p>According to PNP Directorate for Police-Community Relations director, Major General Benigno B. Durana Jr., they are empowering the noble role of men in uniform to be actively involved in government effort to topple all forms of discrimination and violence against women.</p>
      <p>Durana yesterday led the opening ceremony of the 6th Men Opposed to Violence Against Women Everywhere (MOVE) PNP summit with the theme “VAW Free Community Starts with Me”.</p>
      <p>The official said they envision a VAW-free society where men take an active role in eliminating violence against women as studies show that men are mostly the perpetrators of VAW.</p>
      <p>MOVE was launched on November 27, 2006 through the initiative of the Philippine Commission on Women during the commemoration of the 18-Day Campaign to End VAW.</p>
      <p>The MOVE PNP Chapter was officially organized on January 14, 2010 during the first MOVE PNP Summit on MOVE attended by PCR officers of the different PNP units and offices.</p>
