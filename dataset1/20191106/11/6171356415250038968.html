      <h1>Fossil reveals Hybrid HR smartwatch with two-week battery life for $195</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:00:26+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Fossil's hybrid smartwatches have <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/05/collider-hybrid-smartwatch-leaks-point-to-change-in-direction-for-fossils-wearables/">leaked a few times already</a>, but now the company is ready to make things official. Today, Fossil Group revealed its new Hybrid HR smartwatch, which promises over two weeks of battery life on a single charge while retaining most of the functionality that people use smartwatches for.</p>
      <p>There was some debate over what operating system Fossil's hybrid watch would use, since the interface in previously-leaked images looked an awful lot like Wear OS. However, there's no mention of Google in the announcement, and the 'Fossil Smartwatches' app will be required to pair it with a phone, so the company seems to be using its own software stack.</p>

      <p>Fossil says the Hybrid HR should last more than two weeks on a single charge with all features activated, which is far longer than the company's <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/16/fossil-q-5th-gen-review/">current Wear OS watch</a> can manage. You might expect the extended battery life to come with less functionality, but the watch still can do most typical smartwatch functions â€” including activity/sleep tracking, heart rate sensing, alarms, displaying notifications, and controlling music. The watch is even 3ATM water resistant.</p>

        <i>Some variants of the Fossil Hybrid HR</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Hybrid HR uses physical clock hands on top of a "power-efficient display" (presumably a form of e-ink), so there's no LCD screen using up the watch's battery. Fossil says there is a built-in light so you can still read the time in dark environments, but none of the provided images show that in action. The case size is 42 mm across, with a display size of 27 mm and a thickness of 11 mm.</p>
      <p>Two models are available: the gold Charter HR and the darker Collider HR. Depending on the band and case style you choose, the price will be anywhere from $195 to $215. You can purchase them today from <a href="https://www.fossil.com/">Fossil.com</a>, select Fossil physical locations, and a few online stores.</p>
