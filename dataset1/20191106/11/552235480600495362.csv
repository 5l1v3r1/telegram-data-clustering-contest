Jonathan Baillie has stepped down as Troon manager after a nightmare start to the season.
The 34-year-old had been in charge of the West Premiership outfit since June but announced his departure on twitter this morning.
His resignation comes on the back of a 1-0 defeat at Rossvale on Saturday which left Troon languishing second bottom of the table.
The Portland Park side have lost 10 of their 13 league games played so far.
Baillie admitted he feared the axe in an interview with Ayrshire Juniors reporter Lewis Moynihan after the latest defeat.
 
He said: ""Absolutely there's worry, we are getting beat every week. 
""We've lost three on the spin in the league – I've got to be under pressure as we are down at the bottom of the table.
""If the club feel the need to make a change then that's fine, I'm not going to have any complaints; the results speak for themselves.""
And this morning, posting on his personal twitter page Baillie said: ""Monday night I left my position as manager of Troon. Many mitigating factors but ultimately results not been good enough.""
