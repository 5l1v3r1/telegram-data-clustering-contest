      <h3>COMBINED agents of the National Capital Region Police Office and the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group on Monday evening shot dead a notorious gun-for-hire and drug trafficker in Metro Manila during a gunbattle in Caloocan City.</h3>
      <p>NCRPO director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas, identified the slain suspect as Eduard Navarete alias ‘Bordado,’ the suspect leader of the Bordado Criminal Gang involved in gunrunning, robbery-holdup and drug trafficking in Camanava districts and other parts of the metropolis.</p>
      <p>According to Sinas, the suspect who is also included in the drug watch list of Barangay 12 in Caloocan City was killed in a shootout in Alimasag Alley in Bgy. 12 at 7:30 p.m. Monday</p>
      <p>The shootout erupted shortly after NCRPO and PNP-CIDG operatives under Brig. Gen. Joel Napoleon M. Coronel responded to an information that the suspect was seen in Alimasag Alley shortly after robbing one Ben-Ar Enriquez.</p>
      <p>He said that the suspect was about to be accosted by officers when he drew a machine pistol and started shooting while trying to escape. The lawmen retaliated killing the suspect on the spot.</p>
      <p>Recovered from the possession of the slain suspect were one Intrated Miami TEC KG-9 machine pistol with a magazine containing several live ammunition, several heat-sealed plastic sachets containing some 100 grams of suspected shabu valued at P680,000 and P2,000 in cash.</p>
