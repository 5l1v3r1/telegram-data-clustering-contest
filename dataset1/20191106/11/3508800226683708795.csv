我們想讓你知道的是「不完美中追求完美，也是一個完美的過程。」

現職烘焙師的Tiffany在新加坡誕生，異地出生只因那時爸爸Joshua剛好攜眷在當地工作。媽媽Queenie待產時已過預產期，醫生建議催生。那天夫婦二人仍有餘暇及心情欣賞晨曦，感覺份外寧靜，決定把女兒命名為靜曦。1992年生的靜曦Tiffany成長至一歲多時，Queenie發覺她走路有問題。兩夫婦帶着女兒東奔西跑求醫，甚至到北京做艾灸。「由西醫看到中醫，再找回西醫。」Joshua說：「所有機會都嘗試去爭取，看看是否有進步。」


發現女兒Tiffany不良於行，Joshua及Queenie兩夫婦帶着她東奔西跑求醫。

正當夫婦為女兒身體狀況到處奔波時，Queenie再度懷孕：「知道懷第二胎時很不開心。」擔心下一個孩子的身體狀況，加上經常帶着女兒跑醫院，做物理治療及運動，她已身心疲憊：「再添個孩子，不知道自己能否應付。」兒子Isaac誕生兩年後，新生命再度降臨這個家庭。Queenie不解為何上天仍要賜給她第三個孩子Vivian，直至某天，小女兒Vivian學步，踉踉蹌蹌走到Queenie身邊，她才恍然大悟，大女兒不能好好走路，兒子學步時自己又剛巧身在異內地，只有Vivian這孩子能向媽媽踏出生命第一步：「好像是上天補償給我，能看見孩子學步，是身為母親應有的快樂、喜悅，我也嘗到那滋味。」
女兒Tiffany因腦麻痺導致不良於行，求醫路漫漫，追求完美的Queenie走過後終於接受現實，調整心態與女兒一起面對缺憾：「不完美中追求完美，也是一個完美的過程。」而爸爸Joshua對於家人體諒及支持大女兒成長深感欣慰：「我們的精力都集中幫助她，對於弟弟和妹妹的專注少了，幸運地，他們都理解家姐的困難。」一家五口，因為有特別需要的成員Tiffany而更加團結。弟弟Isaac是全職音樂人，擁有自己的錄音室，閒來為家姐Tiffany彈琴伴唱。回想童年時代，他不明白為何家姐出現身體障礙：「兒時猶記得家姐能走路，愈大愈困難，這是運氣不好吧。」對於Tiffany的狀況，Issac覺得已不是障礙：「是一個已經克服了的困難，對此我很欣賞。」

老么Vivian自小與Tiffany出雙入對，經常為家姐推輪椅，不過小時候她也曾覺氣餒，旅行時丟下Tiffany獨自一人在輪椅上，自己跑去玩耍：「頗內咎。我是她妹妹，應該推着她多遊歷其他地方，讓她看世界。」現時已到英國求學的她只有暑假才能回港和家姐作伴，為了使Tiffany多走路以強健雙腿，自己練習跑步時也和家姐一起外出，回程時替她推輪椅，讓她用手杖走路。「家姐使我們家關係更親蜜。」Vivian說。

Tiffany從小愛烘焙，憑一雙巧手做出各種糕餅，並立志開設咖啡店：「雖然我雙腳不方便，但可以透過雙手來改變人生。」Queenie全力支持女兒實現夢想，至今雖然願望仍未成真，但已成立了一間以社區為本的烘培工作坊，藉以宣揚克服身體障礙並追尋夢想的精神。Queenie生日這天，女兒Vivian親手做蛋糕，Tiffany則畫了一張賀卡來感謝媽媽支持：「媽媽一直希望有健康的孩子、完美的兒女，所以我希望把事業做得更好，讓媽媽開心。」


為了支持Tiffany實現夢想，媽媽Queenie身體力行，協助女兒開展烘焙事業。

香港電台電視節目《生日快樂》逢星期六晚上8時在港台電視31及31A播映。
