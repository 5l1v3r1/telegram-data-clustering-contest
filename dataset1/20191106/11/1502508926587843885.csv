Among the sectoral indices on the NSE, realty stocks advanced the most with Nifty Realty index surging over 2 per cent to 273.85 levels after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre is working with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) towards tweaking the existing laws to make them conducive for the real estate sector. Nifty Private Bank (up around 1.50 per cent) came second on the list. Nifty Bank index rallied over 1 per cent to 30,591-mark.

Stocks that made news today:

(AstraZeneca) to introduce certain novel ready-to-use (RTU) infusion oncology products in China. The stock, however, pared all its gains later in the day to end at Rs 427.55 apiece on the BSE, down over half a per cent.
