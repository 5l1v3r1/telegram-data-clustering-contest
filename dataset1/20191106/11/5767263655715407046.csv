06 Nov 2019, 11:30

Every parent has a list of funny and awkward situations connected with their children, from the amazing things they do to the funny conclusions they come to make our hair go gray at a faster pace. Being so open to the world and so interested in adventure is a necessary part of any kid’s life that will definitely keep parents from getting bored.
This is why we at Bright Side love children so much. And we love it when mothers and fathers don’t forget to capture all of the funny things their children do — it really does make us happy.
When you realize that not everything is chocolate:

“You can’t see me if I put my hands this way” is the logic of my little sibling...

“My son decided he wanted to hide.”

When you want to look like an adult, you need makeup.

Just go to sleep when you don’t know what else to do.
