      <p>NEW YORK — A <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/05/man-in-custody-for-bronx-elevator-assault-of-67-year-old-veteran/">man accused of beating a 67-year-old veteran in an elevator has been arrested,</a> an official with the New York Police Department said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ray Diaz was inside of a residential building near Southern Boulevard and East 187th Street in the Bronx on Friday when a man attacked, repeatedly punching and kicking him, officials said.</p>
      <p>Now, 22-year-old Josua Marrero is under arrest and facing charges in the vicious attack, police said.</p>
      <p>Diaz suffered lacerations to the face in the beating and was treated at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center.</p>
      <p>Marrero is now facing assault charges for the elevator attack, according to the NYPD.</p>
      <p>“He hit me in the face so many times,” Diaz told WPIX Monday after the attack, still visibly bruised. “I have a messed up arm. I couldn’t fight back.”</p>
      <p>Tips to police “were essential and proved again that our communities have no place for violence” NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea tweeted.</p>
