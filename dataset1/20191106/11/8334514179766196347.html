      <p>JAKARTA (Reuters) - From browsing social media to watching videos and chatting with friends, Indonesian university student Tyas Sisianindita spends about eight hours a day on her phone.    </p>

      <p>“I realize that I am addicted,” the university student admitted, saying she checks her phone continuously from the time she wakes up, even when she is in classes.</p>
      <p>“At night, when I can’t sleep, I can use my phone for up to five hours.”</p>
      <p>A group of fellow students at the University of Indonesia, led by inventor Irfan Budi Satria, has spent three months developing a wearable device that can help internet users like Sisianindita cut down on the time they spend flicking at their phones.</p>
      <p>Called “Nettox”, from “internet detox”, the device is worn on the wrist and contains a pulse oximeter sensor that measures hemoglobin oxygen levels and heart rate variability (HRV).</p>
      <p>Studies have found that prolonged mobile phone usage has a specific lowering effect on HRV levels. The Nettox device emits a sound when HRV and blood oxygen levels fall within this range, which reminds the wearer to stop using their phone.</p>
      <p>For people aged between 18 and 25, the HRV should ideally stay above 60, according to the American Psychological Association, Satria said.</p>
      <p>At a recent trial, Sisianindita’s HRV reading was 44.    </p>
      <p>Internet addiction is a growing social issue in Indonesia. In October, two teenagers were treated for their addiction to internet gaming, media reported.    </p>
      <p>“Children must be taught to be more active and take part in extracurricular activities,” said psychologist Kasandra Putranto.</p>
      <p>Satria’s team is working on personalizing Nettox and improving its accuracy as HRV readings can vary depending on a person’s body shape, gender and health conditions.</p>

      <p>They aim to apply for a patent for their invention with the university by next year.</p>
      <p>Satria says, though, that Nettox is targeted at those already invested in changing their behavior.</p>
      <p>“Our goal is to help the health-conscious,” he said. “To help people who want to free themselves from internet addiction.”</p>
