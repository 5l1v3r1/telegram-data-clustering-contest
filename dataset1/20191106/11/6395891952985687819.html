      <p><b>MOSCOWÂ (AP)</b> - Russian President Vladimir Putin says Russia's new weapons have no foreign equivalents but he insists the country will not use them to threaten anyone.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a meeting Tuesday with senior military officers, Putin said no other countries have hypersonic, laser and other prospective weapons that have been commissioned by the Russian military, adding that "it's not a reason to threaten anyone."</p>
      <p>Putin claimed the new weapons systems are designed exclusively to "ensure our security in view of the growing threats" and vowed to pursue arms control efforts.</p>
      <p>Russia's relations with the West have plunged to the lowest levels since the Cold War years over the conflict in Ukraine and other disputes.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Putin announced an array of new weapons, including a hypersonic glide vehicle, a nuclear-armed underwater drone and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.</p>
