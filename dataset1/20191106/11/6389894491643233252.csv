General election: Ed Vaizey joins MPs stepping down in December
06 Nov 2019, 11:20 by James Booth
Former cabinet minister Ed Vaizey has announced he will step down at the December general election.
Calling it “one of the hardest [decisions] I have ever taken”, Vaizey said the time was right to move on.
“I am passionate about the arts, our creative industries and technology and I want to specialise in these sectors,” he wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
“Let me make one thing clear: I am and will remain an enthusiastic supporter of you as our Prime Minister,” he added.

“I believe that your One Nation agenda is the right path for the Conservative Party, and will be working hard to help my successor, party and Prime Minister achieve a decent majority.”



Vaizey, who served as culture, media and sport secretary under former Prime Minister David Cameron, was not recalled to cabinet when Theresa May took charge in 2017.
The politician was one of 21 Tory MP rebels who voted against the government in a bid to block a no-deal Brexit over summer.
He is one of 10 of those rebels that Downing Street welcomed back into the party as it attempted to push Johnson’s Brexit deal through the Commons.
Vaizey said in his letter: “I want to thank you for returning the whip to me, despite our temporary differences.
“I also thank my association, which has been supportive of me for the last seventeen years.”
Vaizey joins former chancellor Philip Hammond and a host of other MPs who have said they will step down at the next election.
Hammond, who has consistently opposed Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy since leaving his role as chancellor, said he made the decision with “great sadness.”
He said he had to leave politics after the Prime Minister withdrew the whip from him and 20 other Tory rebels, who moved to block a no-deal Brexit earlier this year.
He joins a list of MPs that will not contest their seats again which includes former home secretary Amber Rudd, erstwhile deputy prime minister Sir David Lidington and culture secretary and former treasury select committee chair Nicky Morgan.
Other prominent names stepping down include Conservative leadership candidate Rory Stewart who is fighting the next London mayoral election and Liberal Democrat MP Heidi Allen who left the Conservative Party over its Brexit stance.
