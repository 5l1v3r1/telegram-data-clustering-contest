      <p>An easing in US-China tensions, as hopes that a “phase-one” trade deal would be struck before the end of the month, had led the three-day rally. </p>
      <p>Yesterday US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters he was “hopeful that phase one will be the precursor of a much more robust set of agreements.”</p>
      <p>Analysts hope that optimism over a potential deal would keep the falling prices in check, with China expected to press the US for further concessions.</p>
      <p>According to Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, dropping tariffs could generate a minimum of $20bn worth of farm purchases.</p>
      <p>“Investors will continue to take cues from US-China trade talks,” ANZ Research said in a note.</p>
      <p>Stephen Innes, Asia market strategist at AxiTrader, said that a failure to roll back tariffs “could prompt a significant bearish shift in sentiment.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday OPEC chief Mohammed Barkindo said that he was more optimistic about the oil market outlook than he had been in October:</p>
      <p>He said: “Based on the preliminary numbers, 2020 looks like it will have upside potential. There are definitely brighter spots. The numbers are looking more refined and the picture is looking brighter.”</p>

      <p>OPEC is due to meet in December, along with allies including Russia, to review output policy. In an attempt to increase oil prices, the group has since January implemented a deal to cut output by 1.2m barrels per day until March 2020.</p>
      <p>According to the producer group’s 2019 World Oil Outlook, rising stocks of US shale and other rival sources will squeeze OPEC’s supply in the next five years.</p>
