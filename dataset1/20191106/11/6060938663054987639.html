      <h1>Mahira Khan can’t get over the ‘genes’ and Susanne Khan left stunned over Gauri Khan’s viral family photo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:28:03+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gauri-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gauri-Khan">Gauri Khan</a> had B-town buzzing when they shared a rare family photo that saw them sharing the frame with their kids Suhana, Aryan and AbRam.</p>
      <p>While the click came as a delight to fans across the globe, it was SRK who came up with the best and cheekiest reply. Sharing the photo, he said, “Over years I made a good house...Gauri made a good Home but I really believe we are the best at making some really good kids!"</p>

      <p>Although it was hard to outdo daddy Khan’s comment, it was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahira-Khan">Mahira Khan</a>, Sussanne Khan and Farah Khan’s cute comments that also caught our attention.</p>
      <p>Mahira, who romanced SRK in ‘Raees’, had all heart-eyes for the “genes” the kids shared.</p>
      <p>Bff and fellow interior designer Sussanne seemed bowled over by the click that prompted her to say, “Stunners!! All of you.”</p>
      <p>Farah, on the other hand, commended the parents, saying, “Gauriiiiii U hav done very well!! Look at these gorgeous children.”</p>

      <p>SRK and Gauri recently completed twenty-eight years of marriage and continue to give other famous B-town couples like Priyanka Chopra-Nick Jonas, Anushka Sharma-Virat Kohli and others tough competition.</p>
      <p>While the two have often kept their private lives out of the media glare, of late their photos together on social media send flutters around town.</p>
