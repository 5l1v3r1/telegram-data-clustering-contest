      <p>Over the past few days, you may have stumbled across rumours and speculation suggesting that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yooka-laylee_and_the_impossible_lair"><b>Yooka-Laylee</b></a> developer Playtonic Games is either working on a new <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo_kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></b> title, or that it has been acquired by Microsoft. Neither of these things are true.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/stories/348475-something-seems-to-be-going-on-with-playtonic-and-rumors-of-a-mi">rumours</a> appear to have started soon after it was revealed that former Rare artist Ed Bryan had joined Playtonic. Amazingly, a large part of the speculation was centred around one of Bryan's tweets, in which he shared a photo of a Microsoft bag.</p>

      <p>Further speculation soon started appearing thanks to LinkedIn profile updates and the like, but Playtonic has now set the record straight with the following message:</p>

      <p>So there you have it. Playtonic is still an independent studio and isn't making a new Banjo-Kazooie. And no, when someone uses a Microsoft laptop bag, that doesn't mean that they now work for the company.</p>

        <i>Look at that 'X' at the end of the statement, though. Is that X for Xbox? (It's not, we're kidding). Or are we?</i>
