“Luckily the birds were uninjured and we are grateful to the member of the public for reporting this as they could have been hit by a car.
“We were then alerted to a muscovy duck in a nearby area.
“All three of the ducks found are domesticated breeds, so we feel it’s likely they’ve come from the same place.
“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”
