公眾知情權與病人私隱之間
06 Nov 2019, 11:53 by 一個平凡醫學生的日常。


我們想讓你知道的是雖然我自己都很擔心傷者，但同時間我又不肯定這樣把人家的醫療私隱廣傳是否合適。尤其是本身在醫護行業的，本身的道德規範就包括私隱一項。大眾或許會出於關心轉發傷者的傷勢情況，但我們是否仍對自己的行徑有更高的要求呢？



上幾星期，一位與我屬同一圈子的朋友被捕。其實我與他並不熟稔，純粹是在大家共同朋友的通訊群組裡有人在傳媒直播中截圖提起，才知道這個不幸的消息。很快就有說被捕者本人並不希望消息廣傳，而發問那位朋友知道後也迅速刪除掉相關訊息。但後來他的事情還是屢次給提起，雖然大家都是出於關心，但還是帶來了許多的爭辯。
幾年前辯論過「公眾知情權」是否能凌駕「保密協議」的辯題，緣由該是當年鬧得沸揚的港大校委會事件。當中其實存在不少灰色地帶，而當「保密協議」換成「個人私隱」，爭議就更大了。
幾個月抗爭以來，雞蛋一方被塑造成「暴徒」的形象，卻傷勢慘烈，情況懸殊得被官方描繪成可憐被害者的警察遠遠也追不上。每名傷者送院，在電話屏幕前的我們無法做些甚麼，只能憂心忡忡地等待消息。未幾，總會有不同的醫療消息傳出，一時間社交媒體就會被這些截圖「洗版」，當中有來源不詳但明顯由醫護人員撰寫的，也有傳媒轉述消息人士的報導。
雖然我自己都很擔心傷者，但同時間我又不肯定這樣把人家的醫療私隱廣傳是否合適。尤其是本身在醫護行業的，本身的道德規範就包括私隱一項。大眾或許會出於關心轉發傷者的傷勢情況，但我們是否仍對自己的行徑有更高的要求呢？
也有人覺得在非常時期不應過份執著。一如前線急救員就算被怪責也要秉持中立拯救與自己立場不同的傷者，我們也是否該同樣看待醫療私隱？

我沒有研究過傳媒守則和道德規範，姑且相信他們對訊息真確性會有更高的要求，也在報導前已經平衡了當中和私隱之間的利弊，所以更容易接受身邊人轉發新聞報導。但當看到來歷不詳但又明顯是醫護撰寫的傷者情況記錄，我總是覺得不太正確。
「When they go low, we go high.」這是在這數個月來支撐我的信念。看到無論是中港政府、執法者、對岸民眾、立場相異者的低俗行徑，只有這樣的想法才能讓我稍息怒火。因為我們代表著有思想、有主見而且追尋公義的醒覺的人民，不甘只像「叻哥」「乜都唔信、唔識、唔關我事」，所以我們才對自己有要求，也會在運動中自我修正。
每次看見病人私隱滿天飛，我就很大的矛盾和掙扎。在還未想通之前，至少我不會去主動轉發任何傷者的傷勢，但其他人的選擇如何，我也沒權過問吧。

Between public right to know and patient privacy
06 Nov 2019, 11:53 by the daily life of an ordinary medical student.


What we want you to know is that although I am very worried about the injured, I am not sure whether it is appropriate to spread the medical privacy of others. Especially in the health care industry itself, its own ethics includes privacy. The public may be concerned about the injury situation of the injured, but do we still have higher requirements for our actions?



In the last few weeks, a friend in the same circle as me was arrested. In fact, I am not familiar with him. It is purely in the communication group of everyone's mutual friends that someone in the media live broadcast screenshots, only to know this unfortunate news. It was soon said that the arrested person himself did not want the news to be widely circulated, and asked the friend to quickly delete the relevant information. But then his affairs were repeatedly mentioned. Although everyone was out of concern, it still brought a lot of arguments.
A few years ago, it debated whether the ""public's right to know"" could override the ""confidentiality agreement"". The reason was that the Hong Kong University School Committee incident that had been raging in the past. There are actually a lot of grey areas, and when the ""confidentiality agreement"" is replaced by ""personal privacy"", the controversy is even greater.
Since the fight for a few months, the egg side has been portrayed as a ""thug"", but the injury is terrible, and the policeman who is officially portrayed as a poor victim is far behind. Every wounded person was sent to the hospital. We couldn't do anything in front of the phone screen. We could only wait for the news. After a while, there will always be different medical news, and social media will be ""washed"" by these screenshots. The source is unknown but clearly written by medical staff, and there are reports from media sources.
Although I am very worried about the injured, I am not sure whether it is appropriate to spread the medical privacy of others. Especially in the health care industry itself, its own ethics includes privacy. The public may be concerned about the injury situation of the injured, but do we still have higher requirements for our actions?
Others feel that they should not be too persistent in an extraordinary period. Just as the front-line first-aiders are even blamed for the neutrality of saving the wounded who are different from their own positions, should we also treat medical privacy?

I have not studied the media code and ethics. I believe that they have higher requirements for the authenticity of the message. They have also balanced the advantages and disadvantages between the media and privacy before the report, so it is easier to accept the news reports from others around them. However, when I saw a record of the wounded person whose origin was unknown but obviously written by the doctor, I always felt that it was not correct.
""When they go low, we go high."" This is the belief that has supported me in these few months. Seeing the vulgar behaviors of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, law enforcers, people on the other side, and those with different positions, only such an idea can make me feel a little angry. Because we represent people who are conscious, assertive, and conscious of the righteousness, we are not just like ""Geng Ge"", ""I am convinced, ignorant, and ethical,"" so we have requirements for ourselves. Will correct itself in the exercise.
Every time I see the patient's privacy flying, I have a lot of contradictions and struggles. Before I figured it out, at least I would not take the initiative to forward the injury of any injured person, but other people's choices, I have no right to ask.
