      <p>The UK competition watchdog has approved the £1.4bn acquisition of student accommodation provider Liberty Living by rival firm Unite Students.</p>
      <p>The Competition and Markets Authority announced today that it has decided not to escalate its investigation into the merger to a stage two inquiry after seeking comment from interested parties on whether the take over could reduce competition.</p>

      <p>Unite said the acquisition of Liberty Living, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) , is expected to be completed at the end of the month. </p>
      <p>Following the deal, CPPIB will appoint its London-based real estate investments managing director Thomas Jackson to the board of the enlarged group. </p>
      <p>Unite said the combined group is expected to deliver cost synergies of £4m next year and £15m per year from 2021.  </p>
      <p>Richard Smith, chief executive of Unite Students, said: “We are delighted that our acquisition of Liberty Living has been approved by the CMA.</p>
      <p>“This is a transformative acquisition which brings together the best of two companies with a wealth of expertise and experience in delivering for students and university partners. </p>
      <p>“The enlarged group will be well positioned to meet the growing need for affordable, high quality student accommodation in university towns and cities where demand is strong.” </p>
