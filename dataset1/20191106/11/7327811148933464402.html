      <p>EAST ELMHURST, Queens (WABC) -- A man was fatally stabbed outside a family shelter in Queens.</p>
      <p>It happened on Ditmars Boulevard next to LaGuardia Airport at the Landing Family Shelter in East Elmhurst.</p>
      <p>The building is called the Landing Hotel, but it is actually a homeless shelter for families.</p>
      <p>Investigators arrived at the scene shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They say a 38-year-old man was found unconscious and unresponsive outside the shelter with a stab wound to his torso.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>So far, police have not identified the man, but say he lived at the shelter for about a year.</p>
      <p>The man sought in the stabbing also used to live at the shelter, but his identity has not yet been released.</p>
      <p>They also have not made any arrests and the investigation continues.</p>
      <p>Back in 2015, some neighbors complained that the city converted the hotel to a shelter, without enough notice or input.</p>
