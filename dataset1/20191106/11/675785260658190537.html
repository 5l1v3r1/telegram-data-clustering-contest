      <h1>Every Arsenal manager candidate rated and slated as Unai Emery's job remains under threat</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery impressed then chief executive Ivan Gazidis and was handed the job ahead of seven other candidates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:01:33+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery blew his competition out of the water when he interviewed for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> job following Arsene Wenger's 22-year reign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard impressed then chief executive Ivan Gazidis in his interview by arriving with a pamphlet containing information on every first-team Arsenal player, detailing his findings on them and plans to help them improve.</p>
      <p>He also explained how he's a hands-on boss who trawls through videos of previous performances to fix minute problems - something Wenger never did.</p>
      <p>Things started positively for the Spaniard, but Emery is under pressure a little over a year on from his appointment, and other managers are being linked with his job.</p>
      <p>Here we look at the managers Emery fended off in the first place.</p>
      <h3>Mikel Arteta</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Knows the club like the back of his hand, has watched the best manager of a generation, Pep Guardiola, win back-to-back Premier League titles.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Has no experiencing in football management, let alone the team the size of Arsenal.</p>
      <h3>Patrick Vieira</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Is a club legend so would lift the team, has experience managing in two countries.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Hasn't pulled up any trees at Nice. Before overseeing victory over Reims last Sunday the Ligue 1 club lost three matches on the trot.</p>
      <h3>Thierry Henry</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> One of the most popular names at Arsenal whose presence would lift the club and perhaps more importantly the fans.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Has had just one stint in management at Monaco, and things didn't work out for him. Danger of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer situation occurring at Arsenal with his appointment.</p>
      <h3>Massimiliano Allegri</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Proven cup-winner having tasted title glory once with AC Milan and then five times on the trot with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Dominated with the best team in the league - not unlike Emery at PSG - but, unlike Emery, failed to achieve much in European competitions.</p>
      <h3>Julen Lopetegui</h3>

        <figcaption>Julen Lopetegui struggled at Real Madrid (Image: REUTERS)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Experienced manager who is used to working closely with youngsters, having lead Spain's Under-19s and Under-21s to European titles.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Showed disloyalty to his country ahead of the World Cup and failed when in charge of a big club like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a>.</p>
      <h3>Ralf Rangnick</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> A progressive boss who has won trophies in two different countries with three clubs. Works well promoting youth players and has a clear philosophy.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Is yet to test himself at a big club, which comes with the added responsibility and pressure.</p>
      <h3>Jorge Sampaoli</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> The Argentine is an incredibly experienced manager, who punched above his weight while in charge of Sevilla.</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Struggled managing the superstars of his national team and eventually left by mutual consent following a poor 2018 World Cup run.</p>
