      <p>He’s a man of both community and conservation.</p>
      <p>Privately he will admit it was a very emotional moment as he stood before his Queen.</p>
      <p>Mark Gibson, the Laird of Craigengillan Estate at Dalmellington, received his OBE last week in the splendour of Windsor Castle.</p>
      <p>He was been honoured for his heritage work as a Dumfries House Trustee and founder of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory on his land.</p>
      <p>Mark has already said the honour was recognition for Dalmellington and Bellsbank as well.</p>
      <p>Last week Mark revealed he chatted with Her Majesty about Ayrshire at the Investiture ceremony within the Waterloo Chamber.</p>

      <p>She carefully pinned his OBE insignia to his left lapel.</p>
      <p>He said: “We talked briefly about Dumfries House and then the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory.</p>
      <p>“She was incredibly well briefed and knowledgeable and knew all about Dalmellington and how important both projects were to East Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>“And I am happy to say I do think things are beginning to look up in this area.”</p>
