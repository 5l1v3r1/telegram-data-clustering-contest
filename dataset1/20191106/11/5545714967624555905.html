      <h1>Overwatch 2 director Jeff Kaplan has 'no idea' when the sequel will land</h1>
      <h2>Blizzness as usual</h2>

      <p>During last week's BlizzCon 2019 event, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../overwatch-2-confirmed-at-blizzcon-2019-echo-is-in-571185.phtml">revealed the existence of </a><i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../overwatch-2-confirmed-at-blizzcon-2019-echo-is-in-571185.phtml">Overwatch 2</a></i>, which will see the now-famous roster of misfit heroes continue their payload-pushing adventures into a new title, bringing new modes, maps, abilities and characters to the popular multiplayer universe.<br/><br/>But it looks like those eager to dive back into all of this new content will have quite some time to wait, as <i>Overwatch</i> director Jeff Kaplan has clarified that even a rudimentary release window is yet to be decided upon. <br/><br/>"I don't know. I have no idea," Kaplan responded <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/i-have-no-idea-when-overwatch-2-will-be-out-jeff-kaplan-says/?utm_content=buffer718b9&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer-pcgamertw">when asked for a possible date by PC Gamer.</a> "Like, just let us make it great, that's what we care about more than anything. We don't have a date in mind." Kaplan also noted that the team was expected to go very quiet once BlizzCon was over, in order to concentrate on the development of the sequel.<br/><br/>While it's obviously still early days in the information drip-feed of<i> Overwatch 2</i>. I'm struggling to see it as a fully-fledged "sequel." Given that it seems all of the characters, maps, modes and, thankfully, unlocks will carry over. I still just get a "Super Ultra Overwatch" vibe from all of this, also borne out in the fact players from both titles will still be able to play together - not that I'm suggesting that is a bad thing, of course.<br/><br/><i>Overwatch 2</i> is currently in development at Blizzard Entertainment.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/i-have-no-idea-when-overwatch-2-will-be-out-jeff-kaplan-says/">'I have no idea' when Overwatch 2 will be out, Jeff Kaplan says</a> [PC Gamer]</p>
