      <p>Xerox has set its sights on a far bigger rival than itself. The $8bn printing services company is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-considers-takeover-offer-for-hp-11573012201?mod=breakingnews">considering a takeover of personal computer giant HP</a>, as <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> first reported<i>.</i><br/><br/>On Wednesday, HP confirmed it received a bid from Xerox just a day earlier. <br/><br/>Here is HP's <a href="https://press.ext.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2019/hp_issues_statement_addressing_market_speculation.html">full statement</a>: </p>
      <blockquote>"As reviewed at HP's most recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we have great confidence in our multi-year strategy and our ability to position the company for continued success in an evolving industry, particularly given the multiple levers available to drive value creation.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, we have had conversations with Xerox Holdings Corporation (NYSE: XRX) from time to time about a potential business combination. We have considered, among other things, what would be required to merit a transaction. Most recently, we received a proposal transmitted yesterday.  <br/><br/>We have a record of taking action if there is a better path forward and will continue to act with deliberation, discipline and an eye towards what is in the best interest of all our shareholders."</blockquote>
      <p>With a market value of $27bn, HP is about three times the size of Xerox, which also makes printers and copiers, making the move an audacious one if it were to go though. <br/><br/>The WSJ report, citing unidentified sources, said Xerox's board met on Tuesday to consider a cash-and-stock offer at a premium to HP's market value. By merging, the companies could save $2bn in annual costs. </p>
      <p>The WSJ also reported that Xerox has received an informal funding commitment from a major bank. <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/topic/digital-transformation-a-cxos-guide/"><b>Digital transformation: A CXO's guide</b></a><b> (ZDNet special report) | </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/digital-transformation-a-cxo-s-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Download the report as a PDF</b></a><b> (TechRepublic)</b></p>
      <p>Yesterday, Xerox announced <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-to-sell-stake-in-joint-venture-to-fujifilm-for-2-2-billion-11572931801">it was selling its 25% stake in the decades-old Fuji-Xerox joint-venture partnership</a> that sells document-related products and services in the Asia-Pacific region.<br/><br/>The $2.3bn proceeds from the sale could further contribute to financing Xerox's reported offer for HP.<br/><br/>Xerox has not replied to a request for comment at the time of writing.<br/><br/>The reported news come a year after Xerox abandoned a controversial $6.1bn deal to merge with Fujifilm last year, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/investors-icahn-deason-push-against-fujifilm-xerox-deal/">after investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason lobbied against the agreement, claiming that it undervalued the firm</a>. <br/><br/>Palo Alto-based HP has for its part been facing a challenging market in recent years, as well as sudden changes of leadership. <br/><br/>Last August, its CEO Dion Weisler announced he was leaving the company for personal reasons, and was replaced by the head of its printing business Enrique Lores.<br/><br/>HP's fiscal results in Q3 2019 <a href="https://marketrealist.com/2019/08/hp-stock-printing-woes-ceo-steps-down/">showed a 5% year-over-year drop in its printing revenue</a>. And last month, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hp-to-axe-up-to-9000-staff-globally-as-part-of-company-restructure/">it said that it will cut up to 9,000 staff globally, starting in 2020, as part of a company restructure</a>. </p>
