In our latest TekITnGo video series, we dive into the offerings of the Infinix Hot 8, the company’s newest budget smartphone. The Infinix Hot 8 joins the competitively priced under 15K smartphone category.  The Infinix Hot 8  follows the Infinix Hot 7 that was launched early this year and brings bumped specs it’s sibling lacked.
The Infinix Hot 8 features 4G LTE and a gigantic 5000mAh. Other features include a bigger screen at 6.5″, Android 9 Pie coupled with XOS 5.0 which brings set of customized software features such as the smart panel that basically a floating window that shows shortcuts to different settings and apps.
2GB of RAM, 32GB of onboard storage expandable via microSD card up to 256GB and powered by MediaTek 671 processor.
The Infinix Hot 8 comes with Google’s File app that aims to free up space on your phone by intelligently recommending apps, spam, and duplicate files to remove so that your phone stays in tiptop shape. The app not only helps keep your device organised but also doubles as a file transfer service that requires no internet.
On the optics, you get a triple setup: 13MP + 2MP depth sensor + dedicated low light sensor.
For selfies, you get an 8-megapixel shooter with f/2.0 aperture 81-degree field of view, 4P lens for selfies and video calling along with a front flash.
The 5000mAh battery will give heavy users to light users enough juice to not worry about when next to charge their phones.
