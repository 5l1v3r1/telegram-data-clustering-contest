      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/iu">IU</a> is reported to have changed the lyrics to her song "<b>Red Queen</b>" at a recent concert to pay tribute to <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/sulli">Sulli</a>, who <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/10/sulli-revealed-to-have-passed-away-suddenly-earlier-today">passed away last month</a>. <br/><br/>At IU's '<b>Love Poem</b>' concerts in Gwangju on November 2-3, fans noted she changed her lyrics to her 2015 song "Red Queen" featuring <b>Zion.T</b>, which she previously revealed was inspired by Sulli's self-portrait. In place of Zion.T's rap, she revealed the lyrics below:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"Fill up a black martini<br/>Fill up the glass for the queen without pity<br/>Made her eyes so thinly bloodshot<br/>Will she smile at the world one more time?<br/>Hey, don't bother queen no more<br/>Please don't wake queen up no more<br/>Red queen's going back go on<br/>My queen keep it up go on<br/>Fill up a black martini<br/>Fill up the glass for the queen without pity<br/>A bouquet of flowers in the dark<br/>I give her lullaby bye bye bye<br/>Bye, my majesty"</i>
      </blockquote>
