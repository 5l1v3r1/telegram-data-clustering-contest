OPEC chief optimistic for 2020 as oil price rises one per cent

An easing in US-China tensions, as hopes that a “phase-one” trade deal would be struck before the end of the month, had led the three-day rally.

He said: “Based on the preliminary numbers, 2020 looks like it will have upside potential. There are definitely brighter spots. The numbers are looking more refined and the picture is looking brighter.”
