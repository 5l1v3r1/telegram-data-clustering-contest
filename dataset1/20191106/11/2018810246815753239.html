      <p>It didn’t make the cut back in 1993, but if for some reason you felt like seeing even more footage from the disastrous<i> Super Mario Bros.</i> live action movie, here’s your chance.</p>
      <p>The team at <a href="http://smbmovie.com/">SMBmovie.com</a>, who have spent years <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/02/two-fans-obsessive-quest-to-redeem-the-super-mario-bros-movie">cataloguing and uploading everything you’d ever want to know</a>—and a lot of stuff you wouldn’t—about the film <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/08/26-years-later-heres-a-deleted-scene-from-the-super-mario-bros-movie">have uploaded another lost scene</a>, one that answers a question some fans have been wondering since the movie’s release.</p>
      <p>When the brothers push Koopa into the machine in the Devo chamber, the one that’s able to de-evolve creatures, they’re able to do so when he slips in a puddle of green slime. But...nobody had any idea where that slime came from, since it’s never shown in the movie.</p>
      <p>That’s because the scene where the slime is made was cut, and involves a hapless Devo Technician being de-evolved so far he’s turned into primordial slime. So when Dennis Hopper slips, it’s not a puddle of random slime, it’s a puddle of man.</p>
      <p>Here’s the scene. Note it’s a little rough, since the VFX work was never finished on it:</p>
