      <p>This is the shocking moment a firework display backfired - and a dad was hit on the NECK by a wayward rocket.</p>
      <p>Video shows a pack of fireworks - including a Roman candle, wheel, mines, aerial shot tubes, rockets, multi-shots, and fountains - going off in a family's garden.</p>
      <p>Dad-of-two Neil Sjollema, 39, can be seen backing away before the display goes off with a bang.</p>
      <p>One rocket then flies directly at building site manager Neil as he turns round to watch, striking the right side of his neck.</p>
      <p>Children can be heard laughing with delight as a woman shouts: "Oh my god! S**t! Kids, I think you better get in! Where are the kids?!"</p>

      <p>Neil then stands in the door as the group of 10 - six children and four adults - watch the firework display gone wrong.</p>
      <p>As it ends, everybody laughs with relief.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Neil, from Shenley, Herts., said: "That was pretty funny looking back, there was an initial panic but it made for a fun night!</p>
      <p>"I had some friends and their kids over to have a mini firework display in the garden, after buying a set [from Aldi].</p>
      <p>"The whole thing literally went off with a bang - and then one of the rockets hit me!</p>

      <p>"It didn't hurt too much actually, as I think I was full of adrenaline and wanted to make sure the kids were safe.</p>
      <p>"But it's left me with a tiny mark on my neck! A little souvenir, if you like!"</p>
      <p>He added: "It won't stop me trying again next year!"</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Neil bought the 16 pack of Wow Fireworks earlier in the day from supermarket Aldi.</p>
      <p>The box says: " This 16 pack of fireworks does exactly what it says on the tin…wow! Featuring a variety of amazing effects including fountains, rockets, multi-shots and mines, these fireworks will certainly impress."</p>

      <p>It also warns: "Always read firework instructions carefully before use."</p>
