PASCO COUNTY, Fla. -- A Florida man has been charged with battery after deputies say he hit a teenage driver in the head for driving too close to him.
61-year-old Stephen Grosso was arrested Tuesday in Wesley Chapel.
According to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report, Grosso exited the passenger side of a vehicle and displayed what appeared to be a gold police badge. He approached the 16-year-old driver of a vehicle behind him and complained to her that she was driving too close to his vehicle.
He then reached into the vehicle and struck the girl on the forehead with the badge, then left the scene.
When deputies interviewed him at his home, Grosso admitted to hitting the girl, and said he didn't know why he did it.
