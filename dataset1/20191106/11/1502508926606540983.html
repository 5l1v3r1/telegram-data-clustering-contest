      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T11:31:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Group Corp fell into the red in the second quarter for the first time in 14 years, with its gigantic Vision Fund suffering a 970 billion yen ($8.9 billion) loss on plunging valuations of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>and Uber Inc .</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>was forced to spend more than $10 billion to bail out <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>after the U.S. company's IPO attempt flopped, and it said on Wednesday the fair value of its investment in the office-sharing startup decreased by $3.4 billion in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>At a post-earnings briefing, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said his judgement in dealing with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>had been poor in many ways, a remarkable admission for an executive well known for his ebullience.</p>
      <p>Here are some of Son's comments, translated from Japanese:</p>
      <p>On WeWork:</p>
      <p>- Says his judgement on WeWork was poor in many ways, but the U.S. company is not a sinking boat</p>
      <p>- Says in about 18 months the majority of WeWork offices will be profitable as occupancy increases</p>
      <p>- <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>stopped new leases for WeWork a month ago and this may continue for three to four years, Son says</p>
      <p>- Says he expects there will be a hockey stick recovery in WeWork profits</p>
      <p>- Son says he was told off by SoftBank board members over WeWork</p>
      <p>On WeWork founder Adam Neumann:</p>
      <p>- Son says he overestimated Neumann's good side, turned a blind eye to things like corporate governance, and that he should have known better</p>
      <p>- Says learned a harsh lesson from his experience with Neumann</p>
      <p>On Vision Fund 2:</p>
      <p>- Says Vision Fund 2 is starting investing with SoftBank's money</p>
      <p>- Vision Fund 2 is going to be launched as scheduled, declined to discuss status of negotiations with potential investors</p>
      <p>- Vision Fund 2 to be a similar size to the first $100 billion fund</p>
      <p>On IPO pipeline:</p>
      <p>- Says has started to think SoftBank should be more cautious about timing of IPOs for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>like Uber and Slack</p>
      <p>- Says there is no change to the trend that multiple portfolio <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>will go public every year</p>
      <p>- Says for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>that are getting closer to turning a profit, SoftBank will support them in going public</p>
