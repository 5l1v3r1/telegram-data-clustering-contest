      <p>The war for Westeros <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-game-of-thrones-finale-got-the-important-stuff-righ-1834884402">has been won</a>, and regardless of <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/read-game-of-thrones-finale-script-for-a-glimpse-at-so-1836861260">how you feel</a> about how it all played out, <i>Game of Thrones</i> is over.

      <p>Being published by Chronicle Books this month, Myles McNutt’s <i>Game of Thrones: A Guide to Westeros and Beyond, The Complete Series</i> looks back on all eight seasons of the show to present a detailed re-examination of the events, character arcs, and relationships that <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/our-watch-has-ended-1835156225">waxed and waned</a> as we went from Ned Stark’s uneasy promotion to Hand of the King, all the way to Daenerys Targaryen’s ill-fated siege of King’s Landing.</p>

      <p>Even if you came away from the final season of the show disappointed about specific events or character choices, or even simply wondered what could’ve been with more time in this world, this book is at least a reminder of the meticulous and gorgeously designed build up that came before it. You know what they say <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-creators-behind-game-of-thrones-apparently-had-no-i-1839416149">about the journey</a> being as important than the destination, if not <i>more</i> important in the end? This is that, in hardback form.</p>
