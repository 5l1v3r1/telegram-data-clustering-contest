      <p>Xerox Holdings Corp is considering making a cash-and-stock offer for personal computer maker HP Inc at a premium to its market value of about $27 billion (20.96 billion pounds), the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The US printer maker's board discussed the possibility on Tuesday, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>There is no guarantee that Xerox will follow through with an offer or that one would succeed, it added.</p>

      <p>Xerox has also received an informal funding commitment from a major bank, known as a "highly confident letter", WSJ said.</p>
      <p>Both U.S.-based companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Xerox had said it will sell its 25% stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings , for $2.3 billion, after investor activism scuppered a deal involving the two companies.</p>
      <p>Xerox had scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year after lobbying by two of its main investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.</p>
      <p>HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently. The company's segment revenue was down 5% on-year when it reported its third-quarter results in August.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
