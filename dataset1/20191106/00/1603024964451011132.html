        <b>Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,110 per share</b>

      <p>The large PBT decline, subdued festive sales lead to a cut in FY20 guidance, said Credit Suisse.</p>
      <p>The research house cut its FY20-22 earnings estimate by 8-10 percent as the company faces risks of further cuts to the lowered H2 expectations.</p>
