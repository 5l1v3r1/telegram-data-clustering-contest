Lara Croft is back for another adventure
Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Released for Linux
06 Nov 2019, 00:45 by By Joey Sneddon
Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is now available on Linux and macOS.
The third entry in the rebooted Tomb Raider ‘origins’ series, Shadow pits Lara Croft against the “impenetrable jungles of Central America”, sees her explore underwater environments, and take on a rogue paramilitary organisation known as Trinity.
The Linux and macOS ports of the game, which received fairly decent reviews on its console debut, is handled by Feral Interactive.
But rather than just port the base game and leave it at that, they’ve brought over all Shadow’s extras, upgrades and downloadable content too:


The Forge


The Pillar


The Nightmare


The Price of Survival


The Serpent’s Heart


The Grand Caiman 


The Path Home


The inclusion of all that makes this definitive edition of Shadow of the Tomb Raider exactly that: definitive!
System requirements for Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on Linux aren’t as restrictive as I’d have assumed either, and asks for:

A Vulkan-supported AMD GPU w/ Mesa 19.0+ or
A Vulkan-supported NVIDIA GPU w/ driver 418.56+

3.40GHz CPU


8GB RAM (16GB recommended)


The game itself is available to purchase via Steam or direct from the Feral Store (purchases can be redeemed on Steam).
A Linux or macOS copy of Shadow of the Tomb Raider Definitive Edition costs £44.99/$59.99 (at RRP; future sales and offers may take it lower).
