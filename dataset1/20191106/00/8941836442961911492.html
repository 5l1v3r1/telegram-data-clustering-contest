      <h1>California discloses Facebook probe, sues for documents</h1>

      <p>California’s attorney general disclosed an ongoing probe into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s privacy practices Wednesday, as it sued the company over its repeated refusal to turn over documents and answer questions.</p>
      <p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said his probe has been going on for more than a year. He said he was disclosing it now because his office was making a public court filing to force the company to comply with subpoenas and requests for information.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> is not just continuing to drag its feet in response to the Attorney General’s investigation, it is failing to comply,” the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed in state Superior Court in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>The California probe, one of many legal and regulatory inquiries into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>, began as a response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and grew into an investigation into whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> misrepresented its privacy practices, deceived users and broke California law.</p>

      <p>Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm, gathered details on as many as 87 million <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> users without their permission. The Federal Trade Commission fined <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> $5 billion this summer for privacy violations in an investigation that also grew out of that scandal. California officials say questions have been raised about what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> knew and why it didn’t prevent third parties such as Cambridge Analytica from misusing user data.</p>
      <p>The court filing said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> hasn’t given answers on 19 of the attorney general’s questions and hasn’t given any new documents in response to six document requests. The filing also said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> has refused to search the emails of top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, as the state requested.</p>
      <p>Becerra’s office said it requested additional information after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> took a year to respond to an initial subpoena.</p>
      <p>Investigators sought communications among executives on developers’ access to user data, the relationship between ad spending and access to data and the introduction of new privacy features and privacy-related news stories. Officials also sought information on the effects of privacy settings on third-party access to data and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s enforcement of policies.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>, which has its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
        <p>California hadn’t joined a separate probe involving attorneys general from New York and other states. The New York probe is looking into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s dominance and any resulting anticompetitive conduct. California is also a holdout in a separate probe into Google’s market dominance.</p>
        <p>The District of Columbia and Massachusetts have also gone after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> on privacy. The Massachusetts attorney general’s office is set to argue in a state court Thursday why <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a> should be compelled to stop resisting and turn over documents for its investigation.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s various legal troubles have yet to make a significant financial dent on the company. Even the FTC’s $5 billion fine, the largest ever for a tech company, came to just under one-tenth of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/facebook/">Facebook</a>’s revenue last year. The penalty was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as being too lenient.</p>
