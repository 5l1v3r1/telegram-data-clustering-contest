Record figures for Arapahoe Basin were not immediately available, but the resort – which amazingly opened on Oct. 11 — tweeted that its snowpack stands at 160% of average. Also, Steamboat, which is scheduled to open Nov. 23, has received 63 inches, shattering its previous record of 40.In addition, Denver broke its record low Oct. 29 max temperature with a high of only 18 degrees, The previous record was a toasty 25 degrees set in 1993, according to CPR News. Colorado Springs didn't want to be left out of the low max fun. Folks there saw a high of 20 degrees. Their previous record was 24 degrees back in 1991.

The weekend also marked the beginning of the 80th year of Colorado’s longest continuously running ski resort. On Nov. 16 Winter Park will offer lift tickets for only $40 per person, minimum two lift tickets, to celebrate this milestone. This offer, valid for one day only, is available now.
