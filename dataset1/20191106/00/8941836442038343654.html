      <p>ZURICH (AP) - FIFA says Iraq is not safe enough to host World Cup qualifying games against Iran and Bahrain.</p>
      <p>FIFA says it asked the Iraq soccer federation “to nominate a neutral venue” for the matches on Nov. 14 and 19.</p>
      <p>The games were to be played in Basra, the southern city which hosted Iraq’s return last month to playing competitive games at home.</p>
      <p>Iraq has rarely staged home games since the 1980s because of security concerns.</p>
      <p>Turmoil in Iraq in recent weeks has been fueled by economic problems and dissatisfaction with Iran’s political influence on its neighbor.</p>

      <p>Iraq’s 2-0 win over Hong Kong in Basra last month left the national team at the top of its five-team qualifying group. Two teams advance to the next round of Asian qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
