又到了年底要跑趴的季節，自己開車趴趴走超方便，但是一嗨起來喝酒誤事可就事情大條，雖然找代駕、搭小黃都是替代方案，但都不如把酒穿上身來得更fashion啊！來自義大利的MOSCHINO與美式經典啤酒品牌百威啤酒（BUDWEISER）聯合發佈限量版膠囊系列，推出15款單品，討喜的紅色與歡樂的氣氛，勢必成為年底話題。
MOSCHINO創意總監Jeremy Scott在2014秋冬系列時裝秀上發表首場系列後，他就一直深受百威啤酒標誌中的流行元素啟發，當年他將經典的紅色、灰色、金色和白色標誌運用到MOSCHINO洋裝與披風上，這套秀款也在大都會藝術博物館2019年春季年度時裝展《坎普風格：時尚筆記》中展出。
