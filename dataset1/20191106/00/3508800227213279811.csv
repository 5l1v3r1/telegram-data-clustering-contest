從歷史數據看「和平協議」：比起促進和平，引起戰爭的機率可能大得多
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by 徐英碩醫師


我們想讓你知道的是其實跟大家光看字面的印象相反，和平協議引起戰爭的機會，要比和平協議促進和平的機會大得多。



最近美國在台協會的主席莫健，拜訪我們的總統候選人韓國瑜，據說提供了幾個問題請他在拜訪美國的時候回答。結果他發現可能回答不出來，竟然臨時決定不去了。仔細看看美國在台協會主席提出的這些問題，每一題都值得我們整個台灣社會好好的回答和討論，都是生死攸關的大問題。其中我覺得最重要的一個問題就是：假如中國要你跟他們簽和平協議，你會簽嗎？
其實這個問題之前討論過很多次，有國際法的教授說，要簽的應該是和平條約，而不是和平協議，否則會被認為兩岸問題是國內問題。立委林昶佐之前也因為自己的政黨，似乎不願意為了反對兩岸一家親的和平協議，和民進黨合作，因而不惜賭上自己的政治生命退黨並自行參選。美國人會問這個問題，似乎也是希望我們的候選人表態不要簽。為什麼會這個樣子呢？和平協議不是簽了就會永久和平，應該是大家都樂於見到的事情啊？為什麼會引起這麼多反對的聲音呢？
其實跟大家光看字面的印象相反，和平協議引起戰爭的機會，要比和平協議促進和平的機會大得多。
政治學家怎麼看和平協議的：實證觀點
國民黨宣傳，要保護下一代的安全，不要跟中共起衝突的方式，就是跟中共簽和平協議。他們要用簽署和平協議的方式來結束自己從1949年「播遷」來台後開始的國共內戰。他的邏輯是，既然有了協議，而且是和平的，那就你不能打我，我也不能打你，下一代就安全了。
國共內戰能不能用和平協議的方式解決？人人愛談政治，但政治作為一門學術來研究，對和平協議的可行性，早就有它的實證觀點。我們來看看政治學者Barbara F. Water在她《和平承諾》（committing to peace）一書中的研究成果。她研究了1940年到1992年之間的72場內戰，發現竟然只有3成（23場）內戰，達成了和平協議。（表一）
你或許會說：「不錯啊，至少還有3成。」但要命的是，這只有3成的和平協議之中，竟然還有幾乎一半，最後沒有得到執行，仍然引起戰爭，甚至屠殺。23個和平協議中，有10個被破壞，最後還是打到血流成河，才以其中一方用武力戰勝的決定性勝利來收尾，也就是打到其中一方完全毀滅對手。


表一：1940到1992年有簽和平協議的內戰國家。（資料來源：《和平承諾》（committing to peace），Barbara F. Water）

30年中，72場內戰，僅有13場是用和平協議以和平方式解決的。就算是這23個已經辛苦簽成了的和平協議，裡面竟然有10個被撕毀破壞。這些被破壞的和平協議，對強者來說可能是成功的統一，對弱者來說，那就是大屠殺式的失敗了。
和平協議引發後續戰爭的機會，幾乎是成功達成和平的兩倍
從另一個角度看，72場內戰，打到後來，其實有大概一半（37場）是有想要上談判桌去進行和平協議的。（表二）但是，有進行和平協議的內戰，卻大部分沒有成功用和平協議的方式來解決，仍然引起了後續的戰爭。（表三，表四）想用和平協議解決內戰，卻繼續引發後續戰爭的機會，竟然是幾乎是成功達成和平的機會的兩倍（24 /13）。


表二：72場內戰，打到後來其實有大概一半（37場）有想要上談判桌去進行和平協議。（資料來源：《和平承諾》（committing to peace），Barbara F. Water）



表三：有進行和平協議的內戰，卻大部分沒有成功用和平協議的方式來解決，仍然引起了後續的戰爭。（資料來源：《和平承諾》（committing to peace），Barbara F. Water）



表四：1940到1992年，想簽和平協議，卻簽不成的內戰國家。（資料來源：《和平承諾》（committing to peace），Barbara F. Water）

和平協議不僅不是良藥，還是亡國滅種的毒藥
實質上已經結束的國共內戰，藉由談不攏的和平協議，再打起來的風險，可說是無限大。如果兩岸問題是一種病，和平協議這個藥方再度引起戰爭的風險，比達成和平的機會幾乎大了兩倍。
歷史上看起來，用和平協議這種方法結束內戰，既不有效，也很少被採用。如果你是醫生，推薦病人藥方，結果這種藥很少醫生用，用了之後成功率只有三分之一，失敗的代價還是過沒幾天就會死，如果你是醫生，願意開這種讓病人病得更重的機會、是痊癒機會的兩倍的藥給病人嗎？如果你是病人，聽了醫生的解釋，你還敢用這種藥嗎？
總的來說，想簽和平協議的37個內戰國家，23個成功簽訂了，但其中10個和平協議卻遭到破壞，甚至偷襲對方，打到最後，用其中一方完全消滅另一方來收尾。另外有14場內戰，想簽卻簽不成。真正能用和平協議解決的內戰只有13個，勉強有三分之一，一半都不到。
其他想簽和平協議的三分之二左右的24場內戰，要嘛就是談不成，要嘛就是更可怕的，有10場內戰，是藉由談判過程累積自己的籌碼，放鬆對方的警戒，然後回到戰場上，爭取對自己更有利的位置，再趁機一舉進攻消滅對手。利用這種策略成功結束的10場內戰，最有名的例子，就是表一中排名第一的國共內戰。國民黨竟然把這種「自己」早就失敗過的戰略寫進黨綱，到底是忘記了，還是害怕想起來？更別說雖然年代更久遠，大家卻更為熟悉，琅琅上口的「楚漢相爭」，漢高祖劉邦也是用這種方法偷襲項羽，逼他在烏江自刎，結束戰爭的。
不過你也可以說，還有13個最後也是成功達到和平了不是嗎？那是為什麼呢？我們只要好好學習這些成功的和平協議的經驗不就好了嗎？這些成功的和平協議成功的關鍵是什麼呢？
為什麼大部分和平協議無法成功？關鍵在於缺乏監督和懲罰機制
和平協議這款藥方的治療效果為什麼這麼差，其實很簡單，無法互信而已。交戰雙方要能夠互信，和平協議才有可能達成。互信的基礎，不是口頭承諾的什麼九二共識而已，而是要以實力作為擔保。
所謂的和平協議，不是請客吃飯，大家握握手，簽簽字，照個相就可以了。最重要的步驟，是必需要解除反叛軍的武裝。方法包括讓反叛軍加入政府軍，或是需要讓反叛軍有滿意的領土，或是加入組建聯合政府等等。為了確保聯合政府的正當性，不會有什麼人選輸了，就繼續拿起槍來對幹，還需要有一個公平、公正、公開的選舉。所有的這些動作，光靠交戰雙方的互信，是不可能達成的。光是第一個解除武裝的步驟，只要任何一方先放下槍，就會給自己造成巨大的風險，給敵人創造莫大的機會和誘惑，來把自己毁滅。
因此，簽署和平協議的關鍵，就在於雙方哪一邊要先放棄武力，給另一方接管。兩邊都沒有放棄武力，那就不叫和平協議。但是想也知道，先放棄武力的那一方，最後被滅絕的機會超大，而不放棄武力，最後贏者通吃的誘惑又是多麼誘人。
要跟共產黨簽和平協議，你不只首先就必須面對這只有3成的成功機率，你更不可能叫中共先放棄武力。談不成，解放軍就有藉口進攻台灣。談成了，簽下去，台灣國軍一旦放棄武力，就是屠殺（因為已經沒有戰爭）和流血的開始。為了不要讓下一代有戰爭，結果讓下一代被屠殺，請問國民黨的政客們，這是哪門子的為下一代好？
和平協議，需要有強而有力的第三方介入
因此，如果沒有一個公正，而且擁有壓倒性實力的第三方，監督，並且實際介入這所有的過程，和平協議是不可能達成而且順利執行的。
1979年，英國為了調停辛巴威的內戰，不僅派出軍隊進入辛巴威，監督交戰雙方，讓他們不要輕舉妄動，而且這個軍隊一直停留在辛巴威，直到辛巴威順利完成新一輪的選舉。當政府和反叛軍領袖，都在選舉中看到還可以接受的結果，英國才撤軍。
有趣的是，英國人一開始本來也不想派軍隊進入調停，只是希望用嘴巴講講就讓雙方達成和平協議。不過事實證明，因為沒有第三方的實際介入，辛巴威內戰花了好幾年的和平協議談判，前兩輪全都失敗。都得繼續戰鬥，生靈塗炭，無法收場。直到最後不得已，英國人才冒著自己子弟兵的生命危險，介入調停，最後才能獲得成功。
相對的，發生在盧安達的內戰，就沒有那麼幸運。人人都聽說過盧安達大屠殺，卻很少人知道，這場大屠殺就是發生在和平協議（Arusha accord）簽訂之後的8個月，正是和平協議失敗的典型例子。由於聯合國部隊沒有辦法確實監督和幫忙執行這個和平協議，英美又都不想介入，就在和平協議簽訂之後的1994年，胡圖族政府軍找了個藉口，對解除武裝的圖西族展開了大屠殺，和平協議之中的每一個項目都變成廢紙。直到3個月之後，圖西族反叛軍反攻，獲得全面勝利，內戰才結束。但這時候，種族屠殺已經奪走了上百萬人的生命。
如果用現在的兩岸關係來比喻，中共解放軍就是政府軍，而中華民國國軍就是反叛軍。大家不要覺得自己被當成反叛軍好像很不舒服，事實上，人類歷史上壞事幹最多，屠殺自己人民屠殺最多的，就是政府軍。壞人在拿到極大的權力的時候，能夠幹出來的壞事，是沒有極限，非常恐怖的。
屠殺猶太人的納粹，就是政府軍；展開盧安達大屠殺的胡圖族，也是政府軍；現在在新疆西藏香港屠殺人民的，也是政府軍。所謂官逼民反，要不是人民忍無可忍，為什麼要反叛呢？有了和平協議這個保護傘，把反叛軍的保護自己的能力解除掉了之後，政府軍就更能夠肆無忌憚的展開大屠殺。這在人類的歷史上已經發生過無數次，怎麼還會有人認為「和平協議」是有用的呢？
美國人很清楚，作為可能是全世界唯一有能力監督中共執行和平協議的第三方國家，他們同時也知道，要維持和平協議有多麼困難。如果台灣人將來堅持要跟中共簽訂和平協議，到時候解放軍反悔入侵台灣進行種族屠殺的時候，美國人也需要付出犧牲自己子弟兵的代價，才能避免台灣發生像盧安達那樣的大屠殺。只要台灣人堅守底線，美國人就能靠賣武器給台灣，幫忙訓練台灣軍人，以及派艦隊到台灣海峽幫忙巡航，來維持真實的兩岸和平，避免犧牲。這就是為什麼，美國希望台灣的總統候選人，能對和平協議表態的真正原因。
中華民國國軍要為了簽和平協議，自願放棄武裝嗎？
我們的上一代覺得，國軍，是拿來打回中國大陸用的。既然不用打就可以回去，那麼和平協議簽一簽，國軍解散也沒有關係。但是我們這一代認為，國軍是保護台灣用的。對美國和日本來說，中華民國國軍，更是保護台灣海峽航行自由的重要力量。
即使在一個根本不可能出現的平行世界之中，台灣和中共都願意解除武裝，執行和平協議，下一步就是要舉行選舉，讓台灣人能夠平等參與中共的政治了。等等，中國在共產黨一黨專政之下，有所謂公平、公正、公開的選舉嗎？如果沒有選舉，簽訂和平協議之後，即使台灣像香港一樣出動幾千萬人上街，仍然沒辦法選擇自己的領導人，那這個和平協議不就等於併吞協議嗎？還沒放下槍的中華民國軍人，願意接受這樣的結果嗎？難道要開始玩國軍online，變成游擊隊，在自己的家鄉裡面跟解放軍作戰嗎？
其實美國的這些問題，不應該只有問韓國瑜，現行的法令，和平協議簽訂之後，也要經過國會通過才能實行。大家回去也要問問自己選區的立法委員，對於國民黨要簽這個有很大機會引起戰爭的和平協議，他們的態度是什麼？在單一選區的立委選舉制度底下，其實得票率不用很高，就能夠佔據很多席的立委。要跨過能夠通過和平協議的門檻沒有那麼困難。千萬不要覺得簽訂和平協議的門檻很高，亂投票沒有關係。你的一票，很可能就是引發戰爭、引發中國侵略、亡國滅種的導火線。
註釋
表一~表四：有些表中註明還在打內戰的國家，如菲律賓，到最近已經達成了停火協議而結束了，但我在表格中仍然保持原書中還在打的狀態，因為這個研究是1940到1992年32年間的，1992年以後到現在，可能有些國家已經停火達成和平，但也可能會有新的內戰繼續發生。本篇主題是要討論，在這30年間，和平協議的效果，以及它們成功達成和平，或是協議失敗或被破壞的比率。因此，即使表格中後來有些內戰仍然能用和平協議成功收場，我們也只需要討論在這30年間的進展即可。

Looking at the ""peace agreement"" from historical data: the probability of causing war may be much greater than promoting peace.
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by Dr. Xu Yingshuo


What we want you to know is that in fact, contrary to the impression that everyone is literally speaking, the chances of a peace agreement to cause war are much greater than the chances of a peace agreement to promote peace.



Recently, Chairman of the American Association of Taiwan, Mo Jian, visited our presidential candidate, South Korea Yu, and reportedly provided several questions to ask him to answer when he visited the United States. As a result, he found that he might not answer it, and he decided not to go temporarily. Take a closer look at the questions raised by the President of the American Association of Taiwan, each of which is worthy of a good answer and discussion from the entire Taiwanese society. It is a big problem that is vital to life and death. One of the most important questions I think is: If China wants you to sign a peace agreement with them, will you sign it?
In fact, this issue has been discussed many times before. Professors of international law say that it is a peace treaty, not a peace agreement, or it will be considered that the cross-strait issue is a domestic issue. Before the legislator Lin Yizuo also seemed to be unwilling to cooperate with the DPP in order to oppose the peace agreement between the two sides of the strait because of his own political party, he gambled on his political life and quit the party and voted on his own. Americans will ask this question, and it seems that we also hope that our candidates will not sign. Why is this like this? If the peace agreement is not signed, it will be peaceful forever. Should it be something that everyone is happy to see? Why did it cause so many opposition voices?
In fact, contrary to the impression that everyone is literally looking at it, the chances of a peace agreement to cause war are much greater than the chances of a peace agreement to promote peace.
How Political Scientists See the Peace Agreement: An Empirical Perspective
The Kuomintang propaganda, to protect the security of the next generation, and not to conflict with the CCP, is to sign a peace agreement with the CCP. They will end the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party since the ""release"" in 1949, by signing a peace agreement. His logic is that since there is an agreement and it is peaceful, then you can't beat me, I can't beat you, and the next generation is safe.
Can the civil war between the KMT and the CPC be resolved by means of a peace agreement? Everyone loves to talk about politics, but politics as an academic study, has long been its empirical view on the feasibility of a peace agreement. Let's take a look at the results of political scholar Barbara F. Water's research in her book ""committing to peace."" She studied 72 civil wars between 1940 and 1992 and found that only 30% (23 games) of civil wars reached a peace agreement. (Table I)
You may say, ""Yes, at least 30%."" But the fate is that only 30% of the peace agreements, there are still almost half, and finally did not get executed, still cause war, and even slaughter. Of the 23 peace agreements, 10 were destroyed, and finally they reached the bloodstream, and they ended up with a decisive victory in which one of them defeated by force, that is, one of them completely destroyed the opponent.


Table 1: Civil war countries with peace agreements signed between 1940 and 1992. (Source: ""committing to peace"", Barbara F. Water)

In 30 years, 72 civil wars, only 13 were resolved peacefully by a peace agreement. Even with these 23 peace agreements that have been painstakingly signed, 10 of them have been torn apart. These ruined peace agreements may be a successful unity for the strong. For the weak, it is a massacre failure.
The chance of a peace agreement triggering a follow-up war is almost twice the success of peace.
From another point of view, in 72 civil wars, in fact, about half (37 games) actually wanted to go to the negotiating table to make a peace agreement. (Table 2) However, there was a civil war for peace agreements, but most of them did not succeed in solving them by means of a peace agreement, and still caused subsequent wars. (Table 3, Table 4) The opportunity to resolve the civil war with a peace agreement, but continue to trigger follow-up wars, is almost twice the chance of successfully achieving peace (24 / 13).

Table 3: There is a civil war for peace agreements, but most of them have not succeeded in solving them by means of a peace agreement, and still cause subsequent wars. (Source: ""committing to peace"", Barbara F. Water)



Table 4: From 1940 to 1992, if you wanted to sign a peace agreement, you could not sign a civil war country. (Source: ""committing to peace"", Barbara F. Water)

The peace agreement is not only a good medicine, but also a poison that kills the country.
The risk of fighting in the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which has already ended in substance, can be said to be infinite. If the cross-strait problem is a disease, the peace agreement is a risk of war again, almost twice as much as the chance to reach peace.
Historically, the use of a peaceful agreement to end the civil war has been neither effective nor rarely adopted. If you are a doctor, recommend the patient's prescription. As a result, this medicine is rarely used by doctors. After using it, the success rate is only one-third. The cost of failure will still die within a few days. If you are a doctor, you are willing to open this. Is the patient giving the patient a heavier chance of giving the patient twice the opportunity to recover? If you are a patient, listen to the doctor's explanation, do you dare to use this medicine?
In general, 23 of the 37 civil war countries that want to sign a peace agreement have successfully signed, but 10 of them have been destroyed, and even sneaked into each other. At the end, they use one of them to completely eliminate the other. In addition, there are 14 civil wars. There are only 13 civil wars that can be resolved with a peace agreement, barely one-third, and half of them are not.
Others want to sign about two-thirds of the two-fifth civil war of the peace agreement. If you want to do it, you can’t talk about it. If you want to do it, it’s even more terrible. There are 10 civil wars. It’s through the negotiation process to accumulate your own chips and relax the other’s vigilance. Go back to the battlefield, fight for a position that is more favorable to yourself, and then take the opportunity to destroy the opponent in one fell swoop. The most famous example of the 10 civil wars that successfully ended this strategy is the first civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Table 1. The Kuomintang even wrote this strategy of ""self"" that had long since failed to be written into the party program. Is it forgotten or afraid to think about it? Not to mention that although the age is even longer, everyone is more familiar with the catch-up of the ""Chu and Han disputes"". Han Gaozu Liu Bang also used this method to attack Xiang Yu, forcing him to swear in Wujiang and end the war.
But you can also say that there are still 13 and finally succeeded in achieving peace, isn't it? Why is that? Can we just learn the experience of these successful peace agreements? What is the key to the success of these successful peace agreements?
Why are most peace agreements unsuccessful? The key is the lack of supervision and punishment mechanisms
Peace Agreement The reason why this prescription is so bad is actually very simple and cannot be trusted. The warring parties must be able to trust each other and a peace agreement can be reached. The basis of mutual trust is not the 92 consensus that is promised orally, but the strength as a guarantee.
The so-called peace agreement is not a treat for dinner. Everyone shakes hands, signs a signature, and can take a photo. The most important step is the need to disarm the rebels. The methods include letting the rebels join the government, or need to have the rebel forces have a satisfactory territory, or join the formation of a coalition government. In order to ensure the legitimacy of the coalition government, there will be no one who will lose the election, and will continue to pick up the guns and do the right thing. There is also a fair, just and open election. All these actions cannot be achieved by mutual trust between the warring parties. It is the first step of disarming. As long as any party first puts down the gun, it will pose a huge risk to itself, creating enormous opportunities and temptations for the enemy to destroy themselves.
Therefore, the key to signing a peace agreement lies in which side of the two sides must first renounce the use of force and take over the other party. There is no renunciation of force on both sides, so it is not called a peace agreement. But I also want to know that the party that gave up the force first, the chance of being extinct is too large, and does not give up the force. Finally, the temptation of the winner to eat is so tempting.
To sign a peace agreement with the Communist Party, you must not only face the success rate of only 30%, but you are even less likely to call the CCP to give up the force. If the talk is not successful, the People's Liberation Army will have an excuse to attack Taiwan. After the talks were signed, the Taiwan National Army once renounced the force, it was the massacre (because there was no war) and the beginning of the bloodshed. In order not to let the next generation have a war, the next generation was slaughtered. What are the politicians of the Kuomintang, which is the next generation?
A peace agreement requires a strong third party involvement
Therefore, if there is no fair, and overwhelming third party, supervision, and actual involvement in all the processes, the peace agreement is impossible to achieve and smooth implementation.
In 1979, in order to mediate the civil war in Zimbabwe, the British not only sent troops into Zimbabwe, but also supervised the warring parties, so that they did not act rashly, and the army stayed in Zimbabwe until Zimbabwe successfully completed a new round of elections. When the government and the rebel leaders saw an acceptable outcome in the election, the British withdrew.
Interestingly, the British did not want to send troops to mediation at the beginning, but only hoped to let the two sides reach a peace agreement with their mouths. However, it turns out that because of the actual involvement of third parties, the Zimbabwe civil war has spent several years negotiating a peace agreement, and all the first two rounds have failed. They have to continue fighting, and they are unable to close the scene. Until the end, the British talents risked the lives of their own children, intervened in mediation, and finally succeeded.
In contrast, the civil war in Luanda was not so lucky. Everyone has heard of the Luanda massacre, but few people know that the massacre occurred eight months after the signing of the Arusha accord, a typical example of the failure of a peace agreement. Since the United Nations forces could not really supervise and help implement this peace agreement, the United Kingdom and the United States did not want to intervene. In 1994, after the peace agreement was signed, the Hutu government army found an excuse to launch a large-scale disarmament of the Tutsi. The massacre and every item in the peace agreement turned into waste paper. It was not until three months later that the Tutsi rebels counterattacked and won a full victory, and the civil war was over. But this time, the genocide has claimed the lives of millions of people.
If we use the current cross-strait relationship as a metaphor, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a government army, and the Chinese National Army is a rebel army. Don't feel that you are being uncomfortable as a rebel. In fact, the most bad things in human history are the government forces that slaughter the people who kill the most. When the bad guys get great power, the bad things that can be done are limitless and terrifying.
The Nazis who slaughtered the Jews were the government forces; the Hutu, which launched the Luanda Holocaust, was also a government army; now it is also a government army that kills the people in Hong Kong, Tibet and Hong Kong. The so-called government forces the people to oppose, if the people are intolerable, why should they rebel? With the umbrella of the peace agreement and the ability of the rebels to protect themselves, the government forces are more able to unscrupulously carry out the massacre. This has happened countless times in the history of mankind. How can anyone think that the ""peace agreement"" is useful?
Americans know very well that as the only third-party country in the world capable of supervising the CCP's implementation of the peace agreement, they also know how difficult it is to maintain a peace agreement. If the Taiwanese insist on signing a peace agreement with the CCP in the future, when the PLA repents and invades Taiwan for genocide, the Americans will also have to pay the price of sacrificing their own children to avoid a massacre like Luanda in Taiwan. As long as the Taiwanese adhere to the bottom line, the Americans can sell weapons to Taiwan, help train Taiwanese soldiers, and send fleets to the Taiwan Strait to help cruise to maintain true cross-strait peace and avoid sacrifice. This is why the United States hopes that Taiwan’s presidential candidate will be able to express his position on the peace agreement.
Should the National Army of the Republic of China voluntarily give up its arms in order to sign a peace agreement?
Our previous generation felt that the national army was used to fight back to mainland China. Since you can go back without playing, it is not necessary to sign a peace agreement and disband the national army. But our generation believes that the national army is used to protect Taiwan. For the United States and Japan, the National Army of the Republic of China is an important force in protecting the freedom of navigation in the Taiwan Strait.
Even in a parallel world that is unlikely to occur, Taiwan and the CCP are willing to disarm and implement the peace agreement. The next step is to hold elections so that Taiwanese can participate in the CCP’s politics on an equal footing. Wait, China has a so-called fair, just and open election under the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party? If there is no election, after the signing of the peace agreement, even if Taiwan sends thousands of people to the streets like Hong Kong, there is still no way to choose its own leader. Isn’t this peace agreement equal to the annexation agreement? The Republic of China soldiers who have not put down their guns are willing to accept such a result? Is it necessary to start playing the national army online, become a guerrilla, and fight the PLA in your hometown?
In fact, these problems in the United States should not only be asked by South Korea, the current decree, and after the signing of the peace agreement, it must be passed by the National Assembly. When you go back, you should also ask the legislators in your constituency. What is their attitude towards the KMT’s signing of a peace agreement that has a great chance of causing war? Under the legislature election system of a single constituency, in fact, the votes are not very high, and they can occupy a large number of legislators. It is not that difficult to cross the threshold of being able to pass a peace agreement. Don't feel that the threshold for signing a peace agreement is high, and it doesn't matter if you vote. Your vote is probably the trigger for the war, the aggression of China, and the destruction of the country.
Comment
Table 1 to Table 4: Some countries indicating that they are still fighting civil war, such as the Philippines, have recently reached a ceasefire agreement and ended, but I still keep the original book in the form, because this study is Between 1940 and 1992, 32 years ago, and after 1992, some countries may have ceased to reach peace, but there may be new civil wars. The topic of this chapter is to discuss the effects of peace agreements over the past 30 years, and the success rate of their success, or the rate at which agreements fail or are destroyed. Therefore, even if some of the civil wars in the table can still be successfully concluded with the peace agreement, we only need to discuss the progress in the past 30 years.
