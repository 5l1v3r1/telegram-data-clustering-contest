      <p>The summer placement process across business schools are showing green shoots with an increase in the number of companies visiting the campus and the average pay package for the internship process.</p>
      <p>On an average, there has been a 15 percent rise in the number of companies visiting the campus and a 20 percent increase in the stipends.</p>
      <p>There were fears of companies rolling back on their commitment to hire interns due to the current lukewarm economic conditions in India.</p>
