      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Two years after the death of former teen idol <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-cassidy/">David Cassidy</a>, the new owners of his Fort Lauderdale home plan to post a plaque honoring him.</p>
      <p>Thomas L. White, who co-own the home known as Casa de Mayan, says the tribute is meant to recognize <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-cassidy/">Cassidy</a>’s achievements as a singer, actor and horse racing enthusiast.</p>
      <p>White tells the South Florida SunSentinel he knows <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-cassidy/">Cassidy</a> still has millions of fans because he hears from them all the time.</p>
      <p>The plaque will be unveiled Nov. 21, the anniversary of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-cassidy/">Cassidy</a>’s death from liver and kidney failure. It will be placed on the exterior wall and open to public viewing from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. that day.</p>
