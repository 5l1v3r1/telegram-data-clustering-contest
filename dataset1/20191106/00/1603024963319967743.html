      <p>Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve on Monday held a meeting with some prominent members of the Muslim community, including journalists and spiritual leaders, and appealed to them to accept the apex court's verdict.</p>
      <p>"Elaborate security arrangements are being made with extra precautions in sensitive areas. As this will be the verdict of the apex court, every person should accept it as a citizen of the country and not as any community member," the official said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>As part of the security measures, the police have imposed prohibitory orders from November 4 to 18, restricting any unlawful assembly of people, he said.</p>
      <p>"No celebration or mourning by any community or group will be allowed in the city after the judgement," he said.</p>
      <p>The city police's social media monitoring cell and cyber cell will monitor activities on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and other such platforms, he said.</p>
      <p>"Strict action will be taken against those who post objectionable content, hurting sentiments of any community," the official said.</p>
      <p>Citizens have also been urged not to believe in rumours and alert the police if they come across any such kind of talks, he said.</p>
      <p>"People should report any suspicious person or activity and help the police in keeping the city safe and peaceful," he added.</p>
