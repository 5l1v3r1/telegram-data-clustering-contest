貿易戰下的俄中關係（上）：俄羅斯與中國真的是彼此的「應許之地」?
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by 台灣歐洲聯盟研究協會


我們想讓你知道的是遭逢美歐經濟制裁的俄羅斯，以出口填補中國在美中貿易戰下，不穩定的大量進口需求，不僅緩解了俄羅斯內政與經濟衰頹的困窘，中國長期仰賴美國農產品的缺口，也獲得自俄羅斯茂盛多樣的農產支撐，保留實力繼續與美國磋商逐條關稅。

純牛奶製作不添加植物油，帶有濃郁、溫順奶香的冰淇淋製作秘訣，在使用濃縮奶油降低水分含量、飽含更高的乳脂讓口感細膩順滑後，絕對要裹上厚實的巧克力醬。
這種始於蘇聯時代製作道地俄式冰淇淋的標準化工法，藉由美中貿易戰的爆發，意外地讓俄中人民可以暫時忘卻大國競逐的煙硝，整個自西伯利亞、烏蘭巴托一路綿延至江蘇的歐亞大陸，都能共享一口「流奶與蜜」。
對於正遭逢美歐經濟制裁的俄羅斯來說，以出口填補中國在美中貿易戰下，不穩定的大量進口需求，不僅緩解了俄羅斯內政與經濟衰頹的困窘，中國長期仰賴美國農產品的缺口，也獲得自俄羅斯茂盛多樣的農產支撐，保留實力繼續與美國磋商逐條關稅。

貿易戰下的俄羅斯內政困境
針對2014年接連爆發的烏克蘭危機、克里米亞遭俄羅斯併吞，美國與歐盟先後祭出的經濟制裁，雖無法遏止俄羅斯後續遭控訴介入美國大選、使用化學武器在英國企圖毒殺前間諜等政工行動，但逐漸導致俄羅斯內政與經濟陷入長期震盪卻已眾所皆知。
彭博社指出過去五年內，俄羅斯經濟因制裁損失了6%的經濟成長率，隨著原油價格趨勢不穩、通貨膨脹在俄國國內發生，不僅民眾不滿的聲浪快速擴散，近年的經濟成長率也在2%上下掙扎震盪。
制裁使俄羅斯航天航空等產業，長期依賴從歐洲進口的電子零件供應被切斷，還能轉向中國尋求進口，但經濟停滯的主因是國家部門的肥大化。
據俄羅斯公正交易委員會春季發佈的報告顯示，從生産層面來看，1998年國有部門（包括政府下屬企業）佔GDP比重約25%，但到了2018年已達到60～70%；金融部門方面，因2018年動支國家基金救濟多家銀行，金融機構國有化比例同樣高達七成，這使得普亭親自建立起國家主導型經濟的型態，很難推進根本性的經濟改革。
除卻國際經濟制裁的影響，天災人禍頻仍更放大了俄羅斯內政的窘迫。例如知名的西伯利亞伊爾庫茨克州（Irkutskaya oblast）夏季爆發洪災，近百座城鎮受災、災民超過三萬三千人次。由普亭親自定調為聯邦級別的緊急情況，財產損失初估高達290億盧布（約臺幣150億），數千棟民房被淹，部分道路交通中斷，臨時由政府和央行制定緊急機制，向受災民眾發放補償金紓困。
此外，西伯利亞在同一時間，亦遭逢猶如亞馬遜雨林大火般地焚燒，西伯利亞的末日野火延燒面積達到近五年的新高。由於西伯利亞地方官員不以為意，並以節省預算不影響人命財產為由，對森林大火抱持置若罔聞的態度。
俄羅斯聯邦政府漫不經心的人禍，讓美國太空總署直接公佈焚燒照片，美國總統川普更親自撥打通往克林姆林宮的熱線，主動提出「打火支援」。儘管普亭動員軍隊緊急支援救災，但森林大火已延續近兩個月。環保組織綠色和平評估，當局應在第一時間展開撲救，軍隊投入為時已晚，人為的方法已無法將大火撲滅，而水火交織讓伊爾庫茨克州陷入各種工業汙染的危機，更可能對貝加爾湖造成毀滅性的生態浩劫。

諸如上述的天災之外，莫斯科以北約一千公里的飛彈測試基地，發生武器測試爆炸核輻射意外洩漏，儘管死傷人數不多，但聯邦政府的處置措施反覆不為人民信任，引發當地民眾恐慌紛紛搶購碘片自救。負責照顧感染高劑量輻射受難者的醫護人員，在沒有基本防護裝備的情形下進行療程，控訴政府放任他們自生自滅，猶如車諾比核災事故的當局政府。
善於政令宣傳的普亭，就是在上述內政困境下，進行一年一度的「與普亭直接連線」線上直播，讓俄羅斯公民直接反映問題，並期望獲得解決。有趣的是，在連線持續超過四小時的節目中，共計兩百多萬通來電及問題則數，再透過篩選的73個問題裡，還是洩漏了俄羅斯人民辛苦的現狀。
無論是地方的消防人員實領月薪低於最低薪資11163盧布（臺幣6000），或是位於莫斯科的新手媽媽，在嬰兒生病時卻無法緊急看診，得抽號碼牌耗時等待最終放棄就醫等情況，都突顯俄羅斯人民生活的真實無奈。



種種無奈投射到九月初的俄羅斯地方與區域選舉，當體制內改革的希望再次破滅，選前登記各地舞弊不斷出現，至關重要的各地方市議會候選人登記被取消資格DQ（Disqualify），遂引爆上百座城市遊行抗議，最終俄羅斯出動軍警逮捕超過2000名的示威者進入選舉階段。
在反對派強力動員採取「智慧投票Smart Voting」，將選票集中支持可能勝選的非普亭所屬候選人，選舉結果創下俄羅斯選舉史上，執政黨（統一俄羅斯黨）第一次完全失去對一個地區的控制權。
俄羅斯民粹政黨自由民主黨（LDPR）贏得了哈巴羅夫斯克（Khabarovsk伯力）地區議會的絕對多數，連同早前自由民主黨拿下哈巴羅夫斯克州長，地方反對黨與俄羅斯聯邦的互動將引發全球關注。
另外，至關重要的莫斯科市議會選舉，在總數45名議席中，普亭所屬的統一俄羅斯黨（United Russia）失去三分之一議席，降至25個議席，俄羅斯聯邦共產黨（Communist Party）取得13個議席，親歐民主派的俄羅斯統一民主黨「亞博盧」（Yabloko Party）破天荒舉得4席和公正俄羅斯黨（Fair Russia Party）取得3席。
過去俄羅斯反對派只能從街頭倡議的侷限，有望透過體制內的改革，讓更多俄羅斯內政的困境透明化，並刺激俄羅斯的公民社會茁壯。
貿易戰下的中國內政困境
美中貿易戰名義上為平衡中國商品大量進口美國的貿易逆差，實質上美國係針對「中國製造2025」計畫中的科研新創力進行抑制，儘管中國消費市場能量即將躍居世界第一，貿易戰中的關稅調升，確實重創了中國國內產業、工作機會與外企駐足。
從臺商回流已超過六千億，就能發現外企普遍認為貿易戰將持久，寧可停損認賠殺出中國市場，至於中國國內GDP成長率今年雖仍可保6%，但已創下近年新低；人民幣持續貶值造成國內通膨、中國國際金融公司（CICC）估計，貿易戰衝擊中國近200萬個工作機會，新一波關稅再次調升的後續影響，很快就會在明年春季顯現。
從美商Costco首家登陸上海的爆量買氣，除了突顯外商在貿易戰下的中國市場，仍有強勁的力道支撐，排隊人潮集中購買肉品，主要在於填補非洲豬瘟導致兩億中國豬隻死亡下的肉品缺口。據荷蘭合作銀行（Rabobank）估算，這個數量相當於美國和歐洲的豬隻總合。這除了讓以豬肉為主食的中國人民民心浮動之外，全世界牛羊豬雞肉製品的價格與數量也在逐一攀升。

關於非洲豬瘟與地緣政治衝突的關係，除了可以參考歐盟研究協會的前作，西班牙與巴西持續爆量出口豬肉至中國，已不足以填補中國的肉品需求。中國近期快速向巴西的肉類加工場發出了進口許可，包含大宗牛肉、雞豬驢肉也在中國的進口名單在內，都可能是亞馬遜雨林焚燒下的草原化產物。
非洲豬瘟導致巴西總統放任亞馬遜焚燒，以供應中國國內食用的肉類與大豆需求，進一步造成全球環境的循環惡化，是非常值得持續關注的核心議題，而這樣的疑慮也同樣在西伯利亞發生。
貿易戰促使俄羅斯向中國逐漸增加出口的肉品與雜糧，西伯利亞白豬這種可以禦寒的當地豬種，正逐漸在西伯利亞地區快速擴充農場下，以刺激國內經濟為名，無辜地犧牲俄羅斯林業與全球氣候而成為「代罪羔豬」。
備註：巴西與俄羅斯以經濟為名犧牲環境的跡證，同樣亦發生在印尼與馬來西亞，自1990年至2015年期間，蘇門答臘島、婆羅洲和馬來西亞半島的近70％的泥炭林已經消失。森林被生產棕櫚油的農場所取代，從餅乾到古龍水等產品的消費增加，都導致棕櫚油的產量被迫擴增，逐步影響森林面積。

Russia-China relations under the trade war (top): Is Russia and China really the ""promised land"" of each other?
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by Taiwan European Union Research Association


What we want you to know is that Russia, which has been sanctioned by the US and European economies, has used exports to fill China’s unstable import demand under the US-China trade war, which has not only eased the embarrassment of Russia’s internal affairs and economic decline. China has long relied on American agricultural products. The gap, also obtained from Russia's lush and diverse agricultural support, retains strength and continues to negotiate tariffs with the United States.

Pure milk is made without the addition of vegetable oil. It has a rich, gentle milky ice cream making recipe. When using concentrated cream to reduce moisture content and richer cream, the texture is smooth and smooth, and you must always wrap it with thick chocolate sauce.
This standard chemical law, which began to produce authentic Russian ice cream in the Soviet era, unexpectedly allowed the Russian and Chinese people to temporarily forget the smoke and smoke of the big countries through the outbreak of the US-China trade war. The whole process continued from Siberia and Ulaanbaatar. Jiangsu's Eurasia can share a ""flow of milk and honey.""
For Russia, which is being sanctioned by the US and European economies, the export-filled China’s unstable import demand under the US-China trade war has not only eased the embarrassment of Russia’s internal affairs and economic decline. China has long relied on the gap in US agricultural products. Obtained from Russia's lush and diverse agricultural support, retaining the strength to continue to negotiate tariffs with the United States.
To celebrate Xi Jinping’s 66th birthday, Puting personally presented a whole box of ice cream with blessings. It seems that behind the frequent sharing of “sweetness” between the two heads of state, Russia and China are really the “promised land” of each other.

Russia's internal affairs dilemma under the trade war
In response to the successive Ukrainian crisis in 2014 and the annexation of Crimea in Russia, the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union have not been able to curb Russia’s follow-up actions in the United States, including the use of chemical weapons in the United Kingdom to attempt to poison former spies. However, it has become well known that Russia’s internal affairs and the economy have been in a long-term shock.
Bloomberg pointed out that in the past five years, the Russian economy lost 6% of the economic growth rate due to sanctions. As the crude oil price trend is unstable and inflation occurs in Russia, not only the dissatisfaction of the people is spreading rapidly, but also the economic growth rate in recent years. 2% struggled up and down.
The sanctions have caused Russia's aerospace industry and other industries to rely on the supply of electronic components imported from Europe to be cut off, and can also turn to China to seek imports, but the main cause of economic stagnation is the hypertrophy of the state sector.
According to the report released by the Russian Fair Trade Commission in the spring, from the production level, the state sector (including government subordinate enterprises) accounted for about 25% of GDP in 1998, but by 6018, it has reached 60-70% in 2018; In 2018, the National Fund was used to relieve a number of banks, and the proportion of financial institutions was as high as 70%. This made Puting personally establish a state-led economy and it is difficult to promote fundamental economic reforms.
In addition to the impact of international economic sanctions, the natural disasters and people's disasters have further magnified the embarrassment of Russia's internal affairs. For example, the well-known Irkutskaya oblast in Siberia was flooded in summer, and nearly 100 towns were affected by disasters and more than 33,000 people. The Putin personally set a federal-level emergency, property damage was estimated to be as much as 29 billion rubles (about 15 billion Taiwan dollars), thousands of houses were flooded, some road traffic was interrupted, and the government and the central bank temporarily set up an emergency mechanism. The compensation for the affected people was saved.
In addition, at the same time, Siberia was also burned like a rain forest in the Amazon. The end of the wildfire in Siberia reached a new high of nearly five years. Because local officials in Siberia did not take it seriously and did not affect the life and property of the budget, they ignored the forest fire.
The casual government and man-made of the Russian federal government allowed NASA to directly publish photos of the burning. US President Trump personally called the hotline to the Kremlin and offered to ""fire support."" Although Puting mobilized the army to urgently support disaster relief, the forest fire has continued for nearly two months. The environmental protection organization's green peace assessment, the authorities should start the fight in the first time, the military investment is too late, the artificial method can not extinguish the fire, and the water and fire intertwined the Irkutsk region into various industrial pollution crisis, more likely A devastating ecological catastrophe on Lake Baikal.

In addition to the above-mentioned natural disasters, a missile test base of about 1,000 kilometers north of Moscow, an accidental leak of weapons and explosive nuclear radiation occurred. Although the number of casualties was small, the federal government’s disposal measures did not trust the people, causing local people to panic. Buy iodine tablets for self-rescue. The medical staff responsible for caring for high-dose radiation victims will be treated without basic protective equipment, and the government will be accused of letting them go their own way, just like the government of the police car accident.
Putingai, who is good at propaganda and government propaganda, is conducting an online live broadcast of ""direct connection with Putin"" under the above-mentioned internal predicament, allowing Russian citizens to directly reflect the problem and hope to be resolved. Interestingly, in the series of programs that lasted more than four hours, a total of more than two million calls and questions were passed, and through the screening of 73 questions, the Russian people’s hardships were revealed.
No matter where the local firefighters receive a monthly salary of less than the minimum salary of 11,163 roubles (Taiwanese 6,000), or a novice mother in Moscow, they cannot see the doctor urgently when they are sick, and they have to wait for the final refusal to seek medical treatment. The situation highlights the true helplessness of the Russian people’s lives.



All kinds of helpless projections to Russia's local and regional elections in early September, when the hope of reform within the system was once again shattered, the pre-election registration of local fraud continued to emerge, and the vital local city council candidate registration was disqualified DQ (Disqualify), 遂Detonated hundreds of cities to protest and eventually Russia dispatched military and police to arrest more than 2,000 demonstrators into the election phase.
In the opposition, the mobilization of the ""Smart Voting"" was adopted, and the votes were selected to support the candidates who were likely to win the election. The election results in the history of Russian elections. The ruling party (the United Russia Party) lost completely to a region for the first time. Control.
The Russian populist party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR), won the absolute majority of the Khabarovsk Regional Council, together with the earlier Liberal Democrats who won the Governor of Khabarovsk, and the interaction between the local opposition and the Russian Federation will trigger a global attention.
In addition, in the crucial Moscow City Council elections, among the total of 45 seats, Putin’s United Russia lost one-third of the seats and fell to 25 seats. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (Communist Party) obtained The 13 seats, the pro-European Democrats of the Russian Democratic Party Yabolo Party (Yabloko Party) won 4 seats and the Fair Russia Party won 3 seats.
In the past, the Russian opposition can only be limited by street initiatives, and it is expected that through the reforms within the system, the plight of more Russian internal affairs will be made transparent and the Russian civil society will be stimulated.
China's domestic affairs dilemma under the trade war
The US-China trade war is nominally to balance the trade deficit of large imports of Chinese goods into the United States. In essence, the US Department has curbed the research innovation in the ""Made in China 2025"" program, even though China's consumer market energy is about to leap to the top in the world. The increase in tariffs in the trade war has indeed hit China’s domestic industry, job opportunities and foreign companies.
Since the return of Taiwanese businessmen has exceeded 600 billion, it can be found that foreign companies generally believe that the trade war will last forever. They would rather stop the loss and claim to kill the Chinese market. As for China's domestic GDP growth rate, it can still guarantee 6% this year, but it has hit a new low in recent years. The continued depreciation of the renminbi has caused domestic inflation. The China International Capital Corporation (CICC) estimates that the trade war has hit nearly 2 million jobs in China, and the subsequent impact of the new wave of tariffs will be raised again in the spring of next year.
From the first explosion of the US company Costco to Shanghai, in addition to highlighting the foreign market in the Chinese market under the trade war, there is still strong support, and the crowds are concentrating on buying meat, mainly to fill the African pigs and cause 200 million Chinese pigs. Only the meat gap under death. According to estimates by Rabobank, this amount is equivalent to the sum of pigs in the United States and Europe. In addition to the floating of the Chinese people who eat pork as the staple food, the price and quantity of beef, sheep, pig and chicken products in the world are also rising.

Regarding the relationship between African swine fever and geopolitical conflicts, in addition to the EU Research Association's predecessor, Spain and Brazil continue to explode pork exports to China, which is insufficient to fill China's meat demand. China has recently issued import licenses to Brazil's meat processing plants, including bulk beef, chicken and pork, and China's import list, which may be the products of grasslandization under the Amazon rainforest incineration.
The African pigs have led the Brazilian president to let the Amazon burn, to supply the domestic consumption of meat and soybeans, further causing the global environmental cycle to deteriorate, which is a core issue that deserves constant attention, and such doubts also occur in Siberia.
The trade war has prompted Russia to gradually increase the export of meat and miscellaneous grains to China. Siberian white pigs, which are cold-resistant local pig breeds, are gradually expanding in the Siberian region to stimulate the domestic economy and innocently sacrifice Russian forestry and The global climate has become a scapegoat.
Remarks: The signs of Brazil and Russia sacrificing the environment in the name of the economy also occurred in Indonesia and Malaysia. From 1990 to 2015, nearly 70% of the peat forests in Sumatra, Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia have disappeared. The forest was replaced by palm oil-producing farms, and the increase in consumption from biscuits to colognes has led to a forced expansion of palm oil production, which has gradually affected the forest area.
