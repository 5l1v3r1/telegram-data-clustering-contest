      <p>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Savion Flagg scored 22 points as Texas A&amp;M; started the Buzz Williams era with a 77-63 victory over Northwestern State on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Flagg, a junior forward and the team’s top returning player, made 9 of 11 shots from the field in Texas A&amp;M;’s opener.</p>
      <p>The Aggies shot 56 percent (28 of 50) from the floor, compared to 34 percent (25 of 73) by the Demons. A&amp;M; also overwhelmed NSU (1-1) inside, holding a 44-20 advantage in points in the paint.</p>
      <p>Nikos Chougkaz led the Demons with 12 points. Quenton Jackson scored 13 points for the Aggies and Jay Jay Chandler added 11 for A&amp;M.; The teams were about even in turnovers, with the Aggies committing 14 and the Demons committing 13. Chandler had a game-high five of A&amp;M;’s 14 turnovers.</p>
      <p>Williams, a native Texan, came to Texas A&amp;M; from Virginia Tech, where he led the Hokies to a school-record three consecutive NCAA Tournaments in his five seasons there.</p>

      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M;: The Aggies were a little slow out of the gate in the Williams debut but eventually began playing the style of ball that made him a winner at Marquette and Virginia Tech. Reed Arena was about a quarter full for his first game, but as Williams has said, winning consistently will bring fans.</p>
      <p>Northwestern State: The Demons were quickly brought back to earth by their SEC opponent after opening the season with an 84-57 thumping at home of Centenary on Tuesday. Despite the 14-point loss Wednesday, the Demons know taking on this kind of competition early will help them in Southland Conference play starting next month.</p>
