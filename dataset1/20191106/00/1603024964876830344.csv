Similarly, in August 2019, CARE Ratings downgraded the credit rating of the company's commercial paper from 'Care Al+ (A One Plus)' to 'Care Al (A One)' due to the moderation in liquidity profile marked by large accumulation of receivables under engineering procurement commissioning (EPC) division.
