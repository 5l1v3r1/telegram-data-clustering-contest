      <p>"The dip in the company's performance is mainly due to the downward trend in the automotive sector as a whole, which has been caused not only by sluggish demand but also by a paradigm shift in consumer behaviour," Bosch Ltd Managing Director Soumitra Bhattacharya said.</p>
      <p>To deal with this, the company has initiated a restructuring process, he added.</p>
      <p>"Wherever possible, the company wants to focus on re skilling and redeploying talented associates. Any necessary headcount adjustments will be carried out in a fair and socially acceptable manner, and will also include early voluntary retirement schemes," Bhattacharya said.</p>
      <p>He added that the announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the coexistence of combustion-engine and electric vehicles is definitely reassuring for the automotive industry.</p>
      <p>"At Bosch, we have been investing steadily in developing products and solutions for the mobility of the future while enhancing our combustion-engine technologies," Bhattacharya said.</p>
      <p>The company is already working with vehicle makers on the electrification of the two-, three- and four-wheeler segments including mobility services, he added.</p>
      <p>It has set up an additional provision of Rs 130 crore, disclosed as an exceptional item for the September quarter, towards various continuing transformational projects, it added.</p>
