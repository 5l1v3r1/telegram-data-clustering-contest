Ira Rubenstein, Chief Digital & Marketing Officer of PBS, has explained the new development as a way to “represent” their new identity in the digital age, while holding on to the “iconic aspects” of the brand. The term “PBS” is rendered in a custom type that is larger and more “highly legible” across the multiple platforms where the service is available. It is also designed to be more “modern” and “prominent” than the older, more serious logo in traditional black.
