      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Ho-Chunk Gaming Madison announced Tuesday that it is expanding the reach of its no-smoking policy.</p>
      <p>According to a news release, the casino is banning all smoking products, including vaping devices and e-cigarettes, in an effort to make the casino a clean air environment. Ho-Chunk Nation banned smoking from the casino in 2015.</p>
      <p>“This past four years has been successful and no doubt our decision to go smoke-free contributed immeasurably,” Daniel Brown, the executive manager of Ho-Chunk Gaming Madison, said, “It enabled us to strengthen our customer base by attracting new customers.  Additionally, a recent employee survey indicated positive comments from our staff.  We strive for a healthy environment for both our guests and our staff.  This decision was a win-win-win for our guests, employees and business.  Everyone acclimates and can appreciate a healthier indoor environment and I feel confident this enhancement will be no different.”</p>
      <p>Ho-Chunk Gaming Madison will still maintain an outdoor climate-controlled smoking space separate from the building for people who vape or smoke, according to the release.</p>
      <p>“We are intentional in our consideration and accommodation for all of our guests by offering them a comfortable environment,” Brown said.</p>
