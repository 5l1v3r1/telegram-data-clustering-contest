      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - The Republican Party of Kentucky has filed a complaint against a radio host who is considering a run to unseat U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>
      <p>The complaint seeks an investigation of Matt Jones, who has announced an exploratory committee to run as a Democrat in next year’s Senate race. Another Democrat, Amy McGrath, has already filed to run.</p>
      <p>The complaint alleges Jones is already a candidate and is using his statewide sports radio show to promote himself. The complaint cites “egregious violations” of federal campaign finance law concerning corporate contributions.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>In a tweeted response Wednesday, Jones accused McConnell of trying to get his radio show canceled. He says he’s “not even a candidate at this time.”</p>
