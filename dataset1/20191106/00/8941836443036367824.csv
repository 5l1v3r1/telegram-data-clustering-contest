FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - A 26-year-old Soldotna man reported missing on a hike Monday east of Fairbanks was found dead in a state recreation area.
The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports state park rangers on all-terrain vehicles found the body of Jarred Allen in the Chena River State Recreation Area.
Alaska State Troopers spokesman Ken Marsh says hypothermia is the suspected cause of death. Temperatures Sunday were in single digits.
