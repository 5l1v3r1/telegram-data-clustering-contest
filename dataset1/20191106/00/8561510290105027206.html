      <h3>Scope It Out</h3>
      <p>Electron microscopes are great at producing high-resolution images of a material’s atomic structure — if the material is hard, that is. Unfortunately, the devices’ electron beams can destroy softer materials, so scientists typically rely on X-rays, which can’t reach atomic resolution, to image those.</p>
      <p>But scientists at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have published a pair of studies in the journals <i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10416-5">Nature Communications</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-019-0387-3">Nature Materials</a></i> showing how a technique called 4D-STEM allowed them to use electron microscopy to image soft materials without destroying them.</p>
      <p>And the images resulting from their research are downright gorgeous.</p>

      <h3>Double Time</h3>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/11/05/atoms-in-their-neighborhoods/">newly published press release</a>, the <i>Nature</i> <i>Communications</i> study focused on the use of 4D-STEM to image bulk metallic glass, which has an unpredictable molecular structure. This allowed the researchers to identify atomic-scale weak points in the material that could ultimately cause it to fracture under stress.</p>
      <p>For the <i>Nature</i> <i>Materials</i> study, meanwhile, the researchers used the 4D-STEM technique to image the molecular ordering in a semiconductor before and after the introduction of a processing additive — research that, according to the press release, could impact the field of solar energy.</p>
      <p>“[I]n these studies, we’ve shown that when 4D-STEM is deployed with our high-speed detectors, customizable algorithms, and powerful electron microscopes, the technique can help scientists map out atomic or molecular regions in any material — even beam-sensitive, soft materials — that weren’t possible to see with previous techniques,” lead researcher Andrew Minor said in the press release.</p>
