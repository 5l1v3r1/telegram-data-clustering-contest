      <h1>Review: Joanna Connor takes her blues guitar down new paths</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Joanna Connor</a>, “Rise” (M.C. Records)</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Joanna Connor</a> takes her powerful guitar down new paths on “Rise,” an album featuring some jazzier hues, her considerable acoustic skills and even a guest rapper while also doubling down on her reputation as a blues stalwart.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Connor</a>, based in Chicago, released 2016’s “Six String Stories” after a long break from studio recording even as she enhanced her status thanks to live performances. “Rise” is also characterized by a new backing band, “a bunch of younger men” credited by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Connor</a> for an extra dose of power, and several instrumentals, from the smooth tones of the title track to a cover of Sly and the Family Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay” featuring cracking solos from everyone involved.</p>
      <p>Funky album opener “Flip” is a steamy take on what sounds like a May-September romance - “A woman can’t live on guitar alone” - while “Mutha” features rapper Alphonso BuggZ Dinero toasting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Connor</a> with a dose of humor as she mercilessly shreds the strings.</p>
      <p>“My Irish Father” is a galloping, Rory Gallagher-like acoustic showcase with poignancy added by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Connor</a>’s discovery not long ago of her birth father’s identity. “Cherish and Worship You” is probably the most rocking track on the album and “Earthshaker” is a glowing tribute to a Windy City bass player with some very special skills.</p>

      <p>Intense closer “Dear America” combines an homage to Led Zeppelin’s take on “When the Levee Breaks” with a topical dissertation by Dinero as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-connor/">Connor</a>’s dramatic vocals and fiery fret work, along with powerful work from drummer Tyrone Mitchell, provide an alarming soundtrack to a catalog of political ills and social challenges.</p>
