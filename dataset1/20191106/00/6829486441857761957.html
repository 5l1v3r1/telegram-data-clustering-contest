      <h1>Please Enjoy This Rogue Black Cat Interrupting A Football Game With Absolutely No Apologies</h1>

        <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/sports">Football!</a>
      </p>
      <p>That’s right, we’re talking about football, that thing that we all understand and definitely don’t feel alienated from in a way that made our high school experience deeply painful and confusing.</p>
      <p>Well, in breaking football news, last night, two American football teams played each other in a game of football. But, more importantly, during said game, a rogue cat ran into the field and the internet lost its collective mind.</p>
      <p>I mean, there’s more to be said. But for the moment, feast your eyes on the clip here, and have your day immediately made:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I guess I have a few questions, chief among which is, Why did this cat, clearly already confused and scared, decide to run into an open space? If I was a cat and found myself in a giant, booming arena surrounded by loud and smelly humans, I would run in the opposite direction, not the very epicentre of the chaos.</p>
      <p>My second, perhaps just as pressing question is, Is the cat okay? I’m kinda desperately hoping that the cat wasn’t just chucked out of the stadium gates. It’d be nice if it was adopted, cared for, and is currently sleeping on a particularly comfy pillow and/or poking the eyes out of children, the two favourite activities of cats.</p>
      <p>Anyway, the internet stans the cat now and has decided that it holds the key to all of their happiness and prosperity.</p>

      <p>Things ramped up another level, however, when <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/local-news/delay-of-game-black-cat-crosses-nfls-path/">a bunch of cats who were watching the television spotted their feline brethren</a>. The resulting clip is a surplus of joy, as the young kittens recognise the breakout star of the match, and realise that one day they too could interrupt the activities of humans.</p>

      <p>Extraordinary.</p>
      <p>Also, we’re all on the same page with this one, hey: there should be more cats in sports.</p>
