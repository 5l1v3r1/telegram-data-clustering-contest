      <h1>We Just Found an 11-Million-Year-Old Ancestor That Hints How Humans Began to Walk</h1>

      <p>The fact we can confidently balance on top of a pair of meat-sticks without toppling over is the very symbol of human evolution. Yet just how we came to stand upright in the first place remains a hotly debated topic.</p>
      <p>Now we have a new piece in the puzzle. Recently discovered fossils left by a relative who lived during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene">Miocene</a> some 11.6 million years ago has provided compelling new evidence that our journey onto open ground could be compared to a toddler learning to walk, rather than a baby rising from a crawl.</p>
      <p>Thanks to an assortment of well-preserved hominid bones uncovered from a German dig site in recent years, an international team of researchers has had a rare look at the bodies of ancient relatives who were yet to leave the safety of the forest canopy.</p>
      <p>Most ancient primate bones we uncover tend to be small or heavily fragmented, leaving us to fill in the blanks by making comparisons and guesswork. </p>
      <p>Since limbs and pelvises are some of the hardest body parts to come by, determining how we went from squatting in branches to being able to waltz has been a bit of a challenge. One of the big questions is whether humans crawled or walked on palms and knuckles before they rose up to stand.</p>
      <p>Luckily for us, this trove of old-school specimens include a bonanza of jaw bones, femurs, vertebrae, and foot bones from a male, a juvenile, and two females of an ape-like species researchers have dubbed <i>Danuvius guggenmosi</i>.</p>
      <p>Putting the jigsaw together reveals an animal with body proportions that wouldn't look weird on a chimpanzee, only with slightly less robust hands, more similar to those of an orangutan.</p>
      <p>For the most part, <i>Danuvius</i> resembled another primate of the Miocene called <i><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/dryopithecus-tree-ape-1093073">Dryopithecus</a></i>, but it's the variety of previously unseen features that have palaeontologists excited.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/when-did-human-ancestors-walk-on-two-legs-3-6-million-years-evolution">at least 4 to 5 million years</a>, humans and their rag-tag collective of now-extinct close cousins have been strictly bipedal, with hind-limbs perfectly suited for acting as pendulums that swing back and forth with each stride.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lucy-the-human-ancestor-was-likely-just-as-good-at-climbing-as-walking">Some of those relatives</a> have hinted our departure from a life among the trees was anything but a clean break, but it's been difficult tracing a clear evolutionary pathway from gripping tree limbs with our feet to planting them solidly on the ground.</p>
      <p>Some experts are fairly confident that our first tentative steps relied on <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/primate-locomotion-105284696/">palmigrade locomotion</a>, with our palms and soles pressed to the soil as we loped or scrambled from place to place.</p>
      <p>Others think the evolution of human bipedalism was far more gradual, with our ancestors retaining a firm grip on the surrounding vegetation much as chimpanzees do today, holding ourselves steady until needs drove us to step further and further away.</p>
      <p><i>Danuvius's</i> bones point more towards that second hypothesis, but with a slight difference, indicating process called extended limb clambering.</p>
      <p>A close look at <i>Danuvius's</i> hands reveals bones that simply wouldn't have been robust enough for a slumped, gorilla-like knuckle walk.</p>
      <p>But there are also clear signs it still could have used its arms to hang suspended from the branches, similar to chimps.</p>
      <p>The big difference is that it had a pair of comparably strong legs steadily keeping its body upright by pressing up from the ground, instead of just using its arms to hang.</p>
      <p>What makes this particular form of suspensory movement stand out is a reliance on both sets of limbs to hold balance, showing no particular preference for pulling itself up with its arms or pushing itself along with its legs.</p>
      <p>The picture we get is of a dangling hominid tentatively holding on like a child gripping its parent's fingers, moving like a toddler through the forest shade rather than pushing itself up from a four-limbed crawl on palms or knuckles.</p>
      <p>Of course those first steps were just the first in a series of adaptations, each a solution in its own way <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-put-humans-on-two-feet-maybe-exploding-stars-millions-of-years-ago">to environmental changes</a> that favoured one form of motion over another. </p>
      <p>Our story is still far from complete. Hopefully there are still plenty of clues left to be uncovered in the bones of our ancestors, that will one day give us a more complete understanding of how humans became such upstanding apes.</p>
