      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> freshman Jordan Dingle saw just what he needed before he hit a game-winning shot in his first career game.</p>
      <p>Dingle scored 24 points and hit a jump shot with six seconds left, lifting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> to an 81-80 win over Alabama Tuesday night.</p>
      <p> ”I saw an opportunity. In the huddle, Coach Donahue said if you see an opportunity don’t hesitate,” Dingle said. “I saw the defender bite a little bit, so I made it to the basket and didn’t hesitate.”</p>
      <p> Kira Lewis Jr. missed two free throws with 2.4 seconds remaining after hitting the go-ahead 3-pointer and scoring 30 points.</p>
      <p> The Quakers spoiled the debut of Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats. AJ Brodeur finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a>.</p>

      <p> ”Taking a loss early isn’t always the worst as long as your guys are resilient enough to come back,” Oats said. </p>
      <p> Lewis made a 3 with 20 seconds left for Alabama but Dingle gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> back the lead. Lewis couldn’t convert from the line with a chance to tie or take the lead.</p>
      <p> ”It’s tough to lose like that, but you just gotta keep moving forward,” Lewis said. “After this, I’m going to have to go shoot some free throws because I just can’t live with not making free throws at the end of the game.”</p>
      <p>Ryan Betley scored 12 points for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> and Eddie Scott had 10.</p>

        <p>Freshman guard Jaden Shackleford scored 16 points for the Tide. James Bolden, a graduate transfer from West Virginia, had 10 in his Alabama debut.</p>
        <p> The Tide led by six with four minutes to go in the first half, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> started a 24-11 run that extended into the second half. </p>
        <p>The Tide struggled defensively after top defender Herbert Jones left the game in the first half with an elbow injury. Jones did not return in the second half.</p>
        <p> Oats said Jones hyperextend his elbow and will get an MRI in the morning to determine the severity of the injury.</p>
        <p>Alabama was 11 of 38 from 3-point range and made just four in the second half.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/penn/">Penn</a> head coach Steve Donahue said his team’s age and experience were an asset in the final frantic minutes. </p>
        <p>“I thought their kids did a great job,” Donahue said. “I just think we’re older and more experienced in this setting at this point. I thought that was an advantage down the stretch.”</p>

        <p>TURNING POINT</p>
        <p>John Petty tipped the ball in for Alabama with 52 seconds left to tie the game at 79-79, but the basket was waved off for offensive goal tending. After a lengthy review by the officials, the call stood and momentum shifted back to the Quakers.</p>
