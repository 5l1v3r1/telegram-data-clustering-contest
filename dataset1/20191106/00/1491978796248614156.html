        <i>The former South Sydney NRL captain is accused of intimidating his father-in-law Mitchell Hooke in October</i>
      </p>
      <p>An alleged dispute between the former South Sydney NRL captain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sam-burgess">Sam Burgess</a> and his father-in-law is based on false allegations, Burgess’s lawyer has told a court.</p>
      <p>The former South Sydney captain, who announced his retirement a week ago, is accused of intimidating Mitchell Hooke in October.</p>
      <p>An interim apprehended domestic violence order, taken out on Burgess on Hooke’s behalf, is based on “false allegations”, Burgess’s lawyer Bryan Wrench told Moss Vale local court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“There was no violence, no intimidation and no threats,” Wrench said of the alleged 19 October encounter at Glenquarry, south of Sydney.</p>
      <p>“So far as an interim order is in place, we make no admissions and make denials.</p>
      <p>“We know not to contact him especially when ... he made false allegations made about that day.”</p>
      <p>Police have also charged Burgess, 30, with intimidation over the alleged Glenquarry incident. No one was injured.</p>
      <p>The magistrate Mark Douglass adjourned the interim AVO to 18 December, when the charge will be mentioned in court for the first time.</p>
      <p>Police served a brief of evidence, containing two statements, on Wrench in court.</p>
      <p>Burgess, an England and Great Britain international, announced his retirement on 30 October, having failed to recover from a chronic shoulder injury that forced him to miss the Lions tour of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>He played 182 games for Souths and was a Clive Churchill medallist, despite suffering a facial fracture in their drought-breaking 2014 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl">NRL</a> grand final win.</p>
