      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Kentucky’s latest freshman star is a guard from Texas who likes to smile wide and take big shots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Tyrese Maxey</a> scored 26 points, including a clutch 3 that beat the shot clock with a minute left, and the second-ranked Wildcats opened the season with a 69-62 victory over No. 1 Michigan State on Tuesday night in the Champions Classic.</p>
      <p>A day after his 19th birthday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a> came off the bench at Madison Square Garden and had one of the best debuts for a freshman in coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-calipari/">John Calipari</a>’s 11-years at Kentucky, which has been filled with one-and-done guards like John Wall and Devin Booker.</p>
      <p>“I wanted him to come in firing,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-calipari/">Calipari</a> said.</p>
      <p>The Nos. 1 and 2 teams opened their seasons against each other for the first time since 1975, and the Wildcats made their case to be top-ranked next week.</p>

      <p>Michigan State entered the season as the No. 1 team in the country for the first time, but aside from All-American <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cassius-winston/">Cassius Winston</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-spartans/">the Spartans</a> struggled to score. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cassius-winston/">Winston</a> had 21 points.</p>
      <p>This Kentucky team is built around returning contributors instead of freshmen, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a> asserted himself in his first game.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cassius-winston/">Winston</a> cut the lead to three on a three-point play with 1:27 left, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a> hit a 3 from way behind the line to make it 65-60 with 59 seconds left.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I just trust my training,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a> said. “I shot that shot a thousand times.”</p>

        <p>The Champions Classic brought the top-four teams in the nation to the same building for the first time in college basketball. No. 4 Duke beat No. 3 Kansas 68-66 in the opener of the doubleheader. The nightcap marked the fourth No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in college basketball in the last 10 years, and the third involving Michigan State in the Champions Classic.</p>
        <p>Neither game was particularly well-played, and each coach said they would have liked to have had a couple of games under their belts before stepping onto the big stage.</p>
        <p>“There were four good teams today,” Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. “None of them were ready for February or March. It is a very difficult thing to play that kind of competition this early.”</p>
        <p>The passionate fanbases sold out the Garden. Kentucky supporters and Michigan State traded “Go Big Blue!” and “Go Green! Go White!” chants when things got close. It was a marquee, event but a choppy game. Neither team shot 40% from the field. They combined to take 50 free throws.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-spartans/">The Spartans</a> couldn’t find the range from 3, going 5 for 26 and certainly looked like they could have used the scoring of senior guard Joshua Langford, who is expected to be out until January with a right foot injury.</p>
        <p>Michigan State had whittled a 10-point halftime deficit down to four when Kentucky went on a 9-0 run behind 3s from Kahlil Whiney and Nate Sestina, pushing the lead to 54-41 with 9:57 left in the second half.</p>
        <p>Kentucky’s veteran backcourt of Ashton Hagans (11 points) and Immanuel Quickley (10 points), both sophomores, but were outshined by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a>.</p>
        <p>“He put on a show,” Izzo said. “He’s got great intangibles. He’s happy-go-lucky but plays hard.”</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-3 guard attacked the basket and made big 3s.</p>
        <p>“It was an amazing birthday celebration,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tyrese-maxey/">Maxey</a> said. “I’m very happy, happy for me and my guys. It was a lot of fun out there.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Kentucky: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-calipari/">Calipari</a> improved to 6-4 against No. 1 teams, including 3-2 at Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Michigan State: The Wildcats looked more the part of the No. 1 team in the country in the first half, building 34-24 lead and disrupting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-spartans/">the Spartans</a> with their length and depth. It was all <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cassius-winston/">Winston</a> for Michigan State. The senior had 12 points, and the rest of the starting lineup managed just two points.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Kentucky: The Wildcats go home to face Eastern Kentucky on Friday.</p>
