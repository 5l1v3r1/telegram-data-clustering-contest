      <p>Deputies said they were called shortly before 12:15 p.m. to the Magic Kingdom after Brian Thomas Sherman placed his arm around the costumed character's shoulders and groped her breast.</p>
      <p>Sherman and his wife were escorted into a meet and greet area, and they sat on either side of the victim, an arrest report said.</p>
      <p>The report said Sherman sat down beside the victim more quickly than she expected.</p>
      <p>"This left the victim physically stuck in between the defendant on her left and his wife on her right," according to the report.</p>
      <p>The report said Sherman repeatedly told the victim that the character she was playing is his favorite, and he placed his arm around her shoulders.</p>
      <p>The victim said she was trained to know that it is inappropriate to be photographed with a visitor's arm wrapped around her and that she was uncomfortable but was unable to move, the report said.</p>
      <p>It said Sherman moved his arm lower so that he could cup the victim's bra with his hand.</p>

      <p>A co-worker could tell that the victim was uncomfortable and told Sherman to change his pose, but he cupped and lifted her breast for several seconds, the report said.</p>
      <p>"When the defendant left the room, the victim began shaking and crying," the report said.</p>
      <p>Deputies said Sherman was identified through a picture taken by a Disney photographer.</p>
      <p>He was booked into the Orange County Jail on charges of battery.</p>
      <p>Records said Sherman was convicted in 1991 of sexual battery on a victim under 12 in Polk County.</p>
      <p>Anyone else whom Sherman might have inappropriately touched is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 407-836-4357.</p>
