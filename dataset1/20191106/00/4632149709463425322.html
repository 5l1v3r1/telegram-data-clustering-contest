      <p><b>ISLAMABAD </b>The second round of talks between the Pakistan government and opposition leaders failed to break the ongoing deadlock between the two sides on Tuesday even as Prime Minister <b>Imran Khan</b>said that he was ready to accept all “valid” demands of the “Azadi March’’protesters, led by a firebrand clericcum-politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman. <br/><br/>Prime minister Khan reportedly made the remarks in a meeting with Defence Minister Pervez Khattak-led team tasked to negotiate with the opposition parties taking part in the massive march comprising thousands of protesters in Islamabad. <br/><br/><br/>“"The government is ready to accept all valid demands except the demand for resignation,” Khan was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune. <br/><br/>Defence Minister Khattak said the government is trying to find a middle ground with the opposition to break the ongoing deadlock. “The talks between the two sides were held in a good atmosphere,” he said. <br/><br/><br/>The protesters are demanding Khan’s resignation, accusing him of rigging the 2018 general elections and ruining the country’s economy, giving rise to steep inflation and unrest.</p>
