      <h1>Freshmen lead No. 3 Stanford to rout of Eastern Washington</h1>

      <p>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">Tara VanDerveer</a> had no problem sending her freshmen into competition early and often. They proved they were ready.</p>
      <p>Freshman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Francesca Belibi</a> had 12 points out and 15 rebounds in helping No. 3 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> win its 21st consecutive home opener, a 92-27 rout of Eastern <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> in the first game of the season for both teams.</p>
      <p>“A double-double in her first game, I guess we’ll get that every game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> joked.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Belibi</a>, who first began playing basketball as a freshman in high school, has come a long way in a short time.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes I’ll be on the sideline and think ‘Wow, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">Tara</a> is my coach,’ ” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Belibi</a> said. “It’s been amazing that even in a couple of months I’ve grown so much as a player. That’s the coaches emphasizing what I need to do.”</p>

      <p>Freshman Hannah Jump hit four consecutive 3-pointers and scored 12 points for the Cardinal, who improved to 34-12 in season openers. Freshman Ashten Prechtel scored 15 points, Kiana Williams added 11 points and Lexie Hull had 10.</p>
      <p>“I think we showed our depth,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “Youth was ready to go, but we still have a lot of work to do.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy Dickie scored seven points to lead the Eagles, who have never beaten a ranked opponent.</p>
      <p>“I think <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> is unbelievable,” Eastern <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> coach Wendy Schuller said. “I watched them play USA and knew we were hitting a buzz saw. We have to grow a lot from this. Offensively we were frustrated but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> made us shoot before we were comfortable.”</p>

        <p>Eastern <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> scored 10 points in the first quarter and was then held to 11 points over the next 28 minutes. Tatiana Reese, who scored five points, hit a 3-pointer with under three minutes to play end the drought.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> limited the Eagles to just over 14% shooting, the lowest opponent’s shooting percentage since at least the 1999-2000 season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> was 13 of 28 from 3-point range, led by Jump. Prechtel and Williams each hit 3 of 4. The Cardinal also recorded its third largest margin of victory and allowed its fifth fewest points.</p>
        <p>The Cardinal never trailed and began pulling away early in the second quarter, using a 13-0 run sparked by Prechtel’s driving layup.</p>
        <p>“We played inspired basketball,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “The freshmen joined right in.”</p>
        <p>The Eagles were 2 of 21 from the field in the second quarter, while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> was 9 of 17.</p>
        <p>Jump hit a 3-pointer in the final minute to give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> a 38-15 lead heading into halftime.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Cardinal coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">Tara VanDerveer</a> used her bench liberally throughout and it didn’t seem to matter who played. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Francesca Belibi</a>, who dunked in a high school game last season, had a double-double midway through the third quarter. The team is loaded and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> only needs to find the right combination and develop the rotation. “This game we looked at a lot of different combinations,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a>.</p>
        <p>CARDINAL PAST AND PRESENT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Francesca Belibi</a> had the opportunity to speak with former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> great Chiney Ogwumike during Team USA’s stay in the area. “We talked about playing the post,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/francesca-belibi/">Belibi</a> said. “I’m not the most physical player. She told me to take my time and use my speed to my advantage.”</p>
        <p>SCHEDULING THE PAC-12</p>
        <p>Eastern <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> coach Wendy Sculler does not shy away from playing powerhouse programs. She’s schedule Oregon and Oregon State in the past and the Eagles also play at Utah. “We always play a difficult nonconference schedule,” she said. “But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> … that’s a team that can win a national championship. They showed a lot.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> travels to meet San Francisco at the Warriors’ new facility for an afternoon contest Saturday.</p>
        <p>Eastern <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> continues an ambitious early-season schedule with a game at San Jose State on Friday.</p>
