Judge reduces Alaska militia leader’s sentence by 10 years

06 Nov 2019

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A judge has taken 10 years off the sentence of an Alaska militia leader imprisoned for a conspiracy to murder government officials.
Alaska Public Media reported Wednesday that 35-year-old Schaeffer Cox was resentenced Tuesday in Washington state.
A 2017 appeals court decision overturned Cox’s conviction for solicitation to commit murder.
The 10-year reduction to his sentence of 25 years coupled with about seven years already served leaves Cox with eight more years in prison.
Cox was a self-described sovereign citizen and leader of the Fairbanks-based Alaska Peacemakers Militia.


He was charged in 2010 with failure to notify a police officer he was carrying a handgun.
Federal prosecutors successfully presented evidence of a plot by Cox and other militia members to kidnap or kill government or law enforcement officials.
