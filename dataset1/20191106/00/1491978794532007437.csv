Tree amigos: the tribe trying to save their Amazon rainforest





A group of men wait on the dock at Puerto Ocopa on Peru’s Ene river



Locals take a boat along the Ene – there is no road transport



An army checkpoint on the Ene river. Since Shining Path guerrillas made this area their base in the 1980s, there has been a military presence



The rainforest in Cutivireni. This part of the rainforest is under threat from illegal logging and small-scale farming



Carrying coffee and other supplies to Mativaiqui, an Asháninka community on the Ene river. Mobile traders stop off at Mativaiqui once a week to buy from locals



The Tankoari Asháninka harvesting yuca, their staple food. Slash-and-burn techniques to create clearings for yuca cultivation is becoming the biggest cause of deforestation in the area



Conservationist and forest guide Jaime Peña visits Tankoari village. Peña works with Cool Earth to help local people reduce deforestation



Deforestation near Tinkareni, Peru. Cool Earth is working with locals to make crop cultivation more efficient and reduce slash-and-burn farming



Villagers in Tankoari: the child lying on the ground has suspected malaria but the nearest clinic is half a day’s walk away



Walter Matos Contreras, a coffee technician employed by Cool Earth to work with Asháninka communities, shows villagers how to tell if the coffee is ready to harvest. The aim is to raise the quality of their coffee crop to fetch a better price



Tankoari villagers with a crop of ripe red coffee beans



The coffee beans are passed through a grinder, which strips off the skin



Trainee coffee technician Andy Peña helps the villagers wash the beans



Seeds of raw cacao, which is grown and sold to river traders by Asháninka communities



Forest guide Jaime Peña cuts open a seed that can be used to make candle wax



Achiote, commonly found in the rainforest, is used by the Asháninka to make traditional red face paint. It’s also used as an insect repellent and sunscreen



Cool Earth’s satellite mapping identifies areas cleared for yuca farming. These maps help the Tankoari villagers to plan their land use and reduce deforestation



Cool Earth team members Hannah Peck and Martin Simonneau with a map of the area. The maps help the community to monitor deforestation around Cutivireni
