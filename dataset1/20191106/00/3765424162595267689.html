      <h1>Warren Park residents demands Zacc investigation into Harare land sales</h1>

      <p>WARREN Park residents have dragged Harare City Council officials to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) over graft allegations in the allocation of stands in the high density suburb.</p>
      <p>This comes after council “illegally” sold residential stands on an area with underground electricity cables against the regulations of the country’s power utility, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa).</p>
      <p>In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Lorraine Musariri described the allocation of stands as corrupt.</p>
      <p>Residents of the suburb and CHRA were Tuesday expected to submit separate letters to the anti graft body requesting its intervention and investigation of the matter.</p>
      <p>According to Musariri, it was only after their outcry that Harare City Council ordered that construction on the site be stopped with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>“We (CHRA) helped the affected residents to draft their own letter which was submitted to Zacc.</p>
      <p>“CHRA has also written its own letter in support of residents, demanding that an investigation be carried out,” said Musariri.</p>
      <p>“Harare City Council has responded by halting any further developments on the stands as the space was not meant for residential construction.</p>
      <p>“We want to expose the officials who approved allocation of stands at a place that was not meant for residential settlement because that was unprocedural and corrupt.”</p>
      <p>Musariri added that the construction of houses violated Zesa regulations.</p>
      <p>“No construction is supposed to take place there because there are Zesa power cables there and there is a transformer there as well.</p>
      <p>“Zesa regulations do not allow construction over power cables and transformers. If construction takes place, the houses will be built on top of underground power cables and near a 11Kv transformer,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Council stopped the construction, but this move was only taken after CHRA raised a red flag.”</p>
      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa in early 2018 set up a commission of inquiry into the sale of State Land which unearthed cases of fraud in the sale of residential stands in all provinces in the country. – Newzimbabwe</p>
