      <h1>Microsoft Bundles Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF Tools Into 1 Super Productive App</h1>

      <p><b>Word, PowerPoint and Excel</b> for mobile are now a single Microsoft Office app. While the idea of it might sound a bit messy, Microsoft has found a number of ways to make your workflow run even more smoothly while saving memory space to boot. <br/><b>By bringing everything</b> into one place, it “reduces the need to switch between multiple apps and significantly reduces the amount of space used on your phone compared to multiple installed apps,” the company <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-Apps-Blog/Introducing-Office-Your-new-go-to-mobile-app-for-getting-work/ba-p/977172?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">explains</a> in a blog post. Within the same app, you’ll be able to access recent or recommended documents, as well as look up files across your organization. <br/><b>The company</b> re-envisioned the Office app as if it were first created for mobile devices, turning the use of your smartphone from a liability into an advantage. Most excitingly, you can now use your phone to transform pictures and physical documents into editable files. <br/><b>Using your phone’s camera,</b> you can turn whiteboards at meetings as well as documents into images. Taking a photo of a document turns it into an editable Word file, while snapping a table turns it into a workable Excel spreadsheet.</p>

      <p><b>By simply selecting</b> pictures from your camera roll, PowerPoint will “help you design a presentation” based on the given visuals, Microsoft says. In addition, you’ll have the option of immediately converting a photo or document into a PDF file. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>You can also</b> sign PDF documents wherever you are, as the Office app lets you create signatures with your finger.</p>

      <p><b>Microsoft believes that</b> it’s done all these without compromising the high expectations of longtime users and feel of the classic Microsoft Office suite. <br/><b>“This solution should</b> feel familiar to the people that know and rely on them today and instill a sense of confidence that they can accomplish their work with the high degree of quality and security that they have come to know,” it adds. <br/><b>A preview version</b> of the new Office app has been made available for <a href="https://aka.ms/OfficePreviewforiOS?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">iOS</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/OfficePreviewforAndroid?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Android</a> users. However, as Apple’s test platform only allows 10,000 users, trials for the iOS app are now closed since all 10,000 slots were snapped up quickly.</p>
