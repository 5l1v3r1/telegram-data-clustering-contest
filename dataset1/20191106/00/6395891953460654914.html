      <p><b>SANTIAGO, ChileÂ (AP)</b> - Protests that have gripped Chile's capital for nearly three weeks to demand better salaries and pensions, and a more equal distribution of the wealth, are shrinking in size.</p>
      <p>Chileans calling for better social services have poured into downtown Santiago again, a day after violent clashes between police and demonstrators.</p>
      <p>But Felipe Guevara, mayor of the Santiago metropolitan region, estimated that Tuesday's gathering drew just 2,000 to 2,500 people. The same square earlier hosted 1.2 million protesters.</p>
      <p>Small protests also occurred in other Chilean cities.</p>
      <p>The unrest began 19 days ago over a hike to subway fares, but it has grown into a massive movement demanding a broad range of changes. Chile's center-right government has responded with a host of proposed social improvements, which must still be approved by Congress.</p>
