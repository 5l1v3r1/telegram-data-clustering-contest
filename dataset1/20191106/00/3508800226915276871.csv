【一週科技趨勢】影音廣告越來越多，如何投放才有效？
06 Nov 2019, 00:20 by TenMax ADTech Lab


我們想讓你知道的是影音廣告當道，不論是廣告交易的買方或賣方，都大力投資在這項容易搶攻消費者眼球的廣告形式上，但這類型的廣告會持續增加，還是因為智慧電視廣告興起而下滑呢？



數位影音的廣告花費將在今年成長20%，達到360億。你是否曾好奇這些花費都流向哪裡？
隨著智慧電視和OTT等多元型態的影音觀看裝置在影音市場上大放異彩，廣告主在操作預算分佈時也受到相當影響。本週和下週的趨勢焦點都將鎖定在今年數位影音趨勢的總整理，將連兩週將四大影音行銷主題分享給行銷人。
除此之外，TenMax也持續鎖定數位行銷界的最新動態，包括Facebook功能更新和程序化廣播最新的實體店面技術應用，一起來瞭解吧！
數位影音廣告趨勢


影音廣告佔近半數程序化費用


影音廣告當道，不論是廣告交易的買方或賣方，都大力投資在這項容易搶攻消費者眼球的廣告形式上。今年的程序化廣告總花費額約為292億，其中將近半數（49.2%）為影音廣告。研究機構認為影音廣告占程序化購買比例多於預期（去年預測2020年的程序化話影音廣告占比為48.7%）的原因，包括智慧電視、OTT和社群影音行銷的快速成長。

從投遞管道切入，社群影音在所有影音廣告中佔有相當的分量。由於臉書、Twitter和Snapchat等社群軟體，都有讓廣告主直接在平台上進行程序化廣告投遞的操作和管理後台，這樣的便捷性也使社群網絡造就三分之一的程序化影音廣告花費。
影音廣告的裝置分佈也存在明顯差距，過半（52.5%) 的投放發生在手機裝置上，但研究預測未來幾年這個比例將會因為智慧電視廣告興起，而有小幅度的下滑。

In-Stream比起原生影音廣告仍略勝一籌


今年原生影音在總廣告花費的佔比為38.1%，原生影音受廣告主青睞程度仍略遜於In-Stream（在觀看影片過程中播放的廣告）的現象可以從幾個原因看出端倪。首先，影音串流平台的快速成長，帶動品牌增加投遞廣告於眾多OTT平台，其中又以YouTube為獨佔，光是YouTube上的插播廣告花費，就佔今年美國地區數位影音廣告花費的11.5%。

再者，許多社群媒體龍頭如Facebook和Twitter，都陸續發展In-Stream服務。如臉書在去年擴大平台上插播廣告的服務種類，期望透過高影片完成觀看率和有聲觀看影片等特色吸引廣告主。Twitter則在去年開放網站主在本地以外的全球市場投放插播影音廣告，網站主可以從中獲利。
但如果從社群媒體的角度來看，不可否認目前原生影音比起In-stream而言，仍是社群網絡的主力。研究數據顯示，兩年前幾乎所有社群影音廣告都採用原生格式（99.5％），但這個數字隨著Facebook Watch和其他較長的影片格式在社群媒體上獲得成功，有逐漸下滑的趨勢，研究預測原生影音的採用比例將在2020年下降至96.2%。
家外媒體新戰場！用超商的背景音樂對你打廣告
商店裡的背景音樂常被人忽略，但未來，這些音樂或許會開始帶有更精準的資訊。
美國Vibenomics主要提供數位電台服務，播放於全美包含便利商店和通訊商店等多達4千個地點，並能接觸多達一億五千萬的不重複聽眾，每個駐點的電台每小時都有16個能置入廣告的時段。近期Vibenomics宣布與科技公司Triton Digital合作，以系統與程序化鎖定受眾，就能夠在日常店面中更精準的投放廣告。透過Triton的技術，廣告主做到如在特定商品走道播放特定廣告、在全國指定種類零售商店投放廣告，或是找出最高銷售額的店面打廣告。
相較於一對一曝光的計算容易，對於家外媒體要如何計算對一群人播放廣告的曝光數，會是一項待考驗的課題。Triton曾經推出過家外媒體的播放系統，這次與Vibenomics能夠在空間內運用雲端程序化計算的技術更是如虎添翼。而以往家外媒體播放時，容易遇到每家店擁有不同軟硬體與系統的差異問題，而使用Vibenomics的店家都有統一系統，也解決了這項難題。
雖然Vibenomics要面對的難題是大眾對於這項技術的陌生、與購買此廣告成效的不確定，但Vibenomics表示近期已與如百事可樂、Live Nation等多達120加知名大廠合作，並發下在未來半年內增加400%的營收，與在2020年前擴展一倍駐點店面的宏願。Vibenomics表示，他們的最終目標是不再仰賴實體店面與廣告代理商，並建構完整的DSP購買平台，讓購買的程序更加開放與便利。

臉書開始測試即將推出的「新聞」功能
臉書近期即將推出風聲已久的「新聞」功能「Facebook News」，這項功能目前於美國部分社群中進行測試。臉書全球新聞夥伴部門的Campbell Brown表示，一般的新聞依舊會出現在動態牆上，未來則會有一塊專屬於新聞的獨立區塊。
這個新功能的開發除諮詢多家新聞媒體，也根據十萬美國的臉書使用者的問券回饋調查作調整。Facebook News不僅會透過演算法，也會透過真人編輯來決定看到的內容，除此之外還會有一塊「今日頭條」的區塊，內容是由一記者群以當日有什麼值得注意的國際要聞決定。
臉書目前並未公開未來合作的媒體，但已有包含洛杉磯時報、BuzzFeed等媒體證實參與。雖然自從社群媒體出現以來，不少新聞業者都對於需要過度依賴社群媒體感到憂心，但這項新推出的功能可能透過授權金拯救傳統媒體逐漸下滑的營收。洛杉磯時報的Hillary Manning表示對於與Facebook News合作的期待，並希望以此接觸更多讀者，並期待看見數位訂閱戶的成長。

[One week technology trend] More and more audio and video advertisements, how to deliver it is effective?
06 Nov 2019, 00:20 by TenMax ADTech Lab


What we want you to know is that audio-visual advertising, whether it is the buyer or seller of advertising transactions, invests heavily in this form of advertising that easily catches the eye of consumers, but this type of advertising will continue to increase, or because of smart TV. Advertising has risen and fallen?



Digital video advertising spending will grow 20% this year to reach 36 billion. Have you ever wondered where these expenses are going?
With the multi-modal audio-visual viewing devices such as smart TV and OTT making a big splash in the audio-visual market, advertisers are also affected by the budget distribution. The focus of this week and next week will be locked in the total consolidation of digital audio and video trends this year, and will share the four major video marketing themes to marketers for two weeks.
In addition, TenMax continues to lock in the latest developments in the digital marketing community, including Facebook feature updates and programmatic broadcasts of the latest physical storefront technology applications, to learn about it!
Digital video advertising trend


Video and audio advertising accounts for nearly half of the program fee


Video and audio advertising, whether it is the buyer or seller of advertising transactions, is investing heavily in this form of advertising that is easy to attack the eyes of consumers. The total cost of programmatic advertising this year is about 29.2 billion, of which nearly half (49.2%) are audio and video ads. Research institutions believe that audio-visual advertising accounts for more than expected program purchases (predicted last year's 2020 programmatic audio-visual advertising accounted for 48.7%), including the rapid growth of smart TV, OTT and social video marketing.

From the delivery pipeline, community video and audio account for a considerable weight in all audio and video advertising. Because of the social software such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, there are operations and management backgrounds for advertisers to directly deliver programmatic advertisements on the platform. This convenience also makes the social network create one-third of the programmatic video and audio. Advertising costs.
There is also a significant gap in the distribution of audio-visual advertisements. More than half (52.5%) of the distributions occur on mobile devices, but research predicts that this proportion will decline in the next few years due to the rise of smart TV advertising.

In-Stream is still slightly better than native audio and video ads.


This year, the proportion of native audio and video in total advertising spending is 38.1%, and the phenomenon that native audio and video is favored by advertisers is still slightly inferior to that of In-Stream (the advertisement played during the movie watching) can be seen for several reasons. First of all, the rapid growth of the video streaming platform has led the brand to increase the delivery of advertising to many OTT platforms, which is dominated by YouTube. The cost of interstitial advertising on YouTube alone accounts for 11.5% of the cost of digital video advertising in the United States this year.

In addition, many social media leaders such as Facebook and Twitter are developing In-Stream services. For example, Facebook expanded its service offerings on the platform last year, and hopes to attract advertisers through high-definition viewing rates and audio-visual viewing. Twitter last year opened the website owner to distribute video and audio ads in the global market outside the local area, and the website owner can profit from it.
However, from the perspective of social media, it is undeniable that the current native video is still the main force of the social network compared to In-stream. Research data shows that almost all community audio and video ads used the native format (99.5%) two years ago, but this number has gradually declined with the success of Facebook Watch and other longer video formats in social media. The study predicts that the proportion of native audio and video will fall to 96.2% in 2020.
New battlefield for domestic and foreign media! Advertise you with super background music
The background music in the store is often overlooked, but in the future, the music may begin to have more accurate information.
Vibenomics in the United States mainly provides digital radio services, which can be broadcasted in the United States, including convenience stores and communication stores, up to 4,000 locations, and can reach up to 150 million unique listeners. Each station station has an hourly station. 16 time slots for advertising. Recently, Vibenomics announced that it has partnered with technology company Triton Digital to target audiences with system and programmatic targeting, and to be able to place ads more accurately in daily storefronts. Through Triton's technology, advertisers can advertise on specific merchandise walks, advertise in designated retail stores across the country, or find the highest-selling storefront.
Compared with the one-to-one exposure calculation, how to calculate the exposure of a group of people to play advertisements for home media will be a subject to be tested. Triton has introduced a playback system for home and outdoor media, and this time it is even more powerful with Vibenomics' ability to use cloud-based programmatic computing in space. In the past, when playing outside the home media, it was easy to encounter the difference between different software and hardware and system in each store. The store using Vibenomics has a unified system, which also solves this problem.
Although the challenge for Vibenomics is the unfamiliarity of the public and the uncertainty of the effectiveness of the purchase of this advertisement, Vibenomics said that it has recently cooperated with as many as 120 plus well-known manufacturers such as Pepsi and Live Nation, and will issue it in the future. Increase revenue by 400% in half a year, and expand its ambition to double its storefront by 2020. Vibenomics said that their ultimate goal is to no longer rely on physical storefronts and advertising agencies, and to build a complete DSP purchase platform, making the purchase process more open and convenient.

Facebook starts testing the upcoming ""News"" feature
Facebook is about to launch the long-awaited ""news"" feature ""Facebook News"", which is currently being tested in some US communities. Campbell Brown of Facebook's Global News Partner Division said that general news will still appear on the dynamic wall, and in the future there will be a separate block dedicated to news.
In addition to consulting a number of news media, the development of this new feature is also based on the questionnaire survey of 100,000 US Facebook users. Facebook News will not only determine the content through the algorithm, but also through the editor of the real person. In addition, there will be a block of ""Today's headlines"", which is a noteworthy international by a group of reporters. The news is decided.
Facebook does not currently disclose the media for future cooperation, but it has been confirmed by the media including the Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed. Although many journalists have been worried about the need to rely too much on social media since the emergence of social media, this new feature may save the traditional media's gradual decline in revenue through licensing. Hillary Manning of the Los Angeles Times expressed his expectation of working with Facebook News and hopes to reach out to more readers and look forward to seeing the growth of several subscribers.
