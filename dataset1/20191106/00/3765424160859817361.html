      <p>The striking physicians’s representative have said the government is negotiating in bad faith and clearly doesn’t care about the healthcare system of the country.</p>
      <p>This was said by the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association’s(ZHDA) Tapiwa Mungofa who said:</p>
      <p>In doing so we maintain that we have not committed any crime by being broke. We eagerly wait to see how this move which defies all common sense will serve as a solution the already strained healthcare system.</p>
      <p>Nothing has been done to improve the welfare of doctors and hospitals working environments therefore doctors nationwide remain incapacitated</p>
      <p>The doctors have been on strike for 64 days and yesterday the govt decided to fire the striking doctors as a disciplinary measure.</p>
