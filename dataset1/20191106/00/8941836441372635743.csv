Former Colorado coach to serve second sex assault sentence

06 Nov 2019

DENVER (AP) - A former Denver high school basketball coach has been sentenced to a second prison term after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a 14-year-old student.
The Denver Post reports 56-year-old Craig Debiase was sentenced to 12 years for attempted sexual exploitation of a child.
A judge handed down the maximum legal sentence Oct. 25 following a plea agreement in which prosecutors dropped 10 additional counts of sexual assault of a child.
A woman testified the former Bishop Machebeuf High School coach sexually assaulted her for three years beginning in 2002.
Prosecutors say the woman was one of at least eight victims abused by Debiase.


Debiase was sentenced in 2005 to 15 years-to-life after pleading guilty to abusing girls. He was released on probation in 2007 after serving 16 months.
