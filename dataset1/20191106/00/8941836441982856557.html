      <p>SAN DIEGO (AP) - The superintendent of the San Diego Unified School District wants to join a Los Angeles Unified School District lawsuit against the e-cigarette company Juul.</p>
      <p>The San Diego Union-Tribune reports Wednesday that Superintendent Cindy Marten says she will take the request to the school board.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles district filed its lawsuit last month, blaming the e-cigarette manufacturer for creating an epidemic of youth vaping.</p>
      <p>The Union-Tribune says a state-administered survey for the 2017-2018 school year found in San Diego Unified about 4% of seventh graders and 7% of 11th graders surveyed used vaping devices in the 30 days prior to being surveyed.</p>
