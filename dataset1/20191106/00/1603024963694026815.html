      <p>The Nokia branded smart TVs will feature audio powered by JBL's sound program.</p>
      <p>"Nokia is a globally popular technology brand and enjoys immense brand recall, so we're excited to start this journey with them to extend the brand into a fast-growing product segment," Flipkart Senior Vice President and Head - Private Brands, Electronics and Furniture Adarsh Menon said.</p>
      <p>Notably, Flipkart also offers smart TVs under its private label -- MarQ by Flipkart. It offers smart TVs with screen size of 24-inches to 65-inches UHD, priced between Rs 6,999 to Rs 64,999.</p>
      <p>"Today marks the start of an exciting new chapter for the Nokia brand in a new category...Flipkart's understanding of the needs and behaviors of Indian consumers, and the power of its reach, will help it make Nokia branded smart TVs accessible and affordable to many," Nokia Vice President Brand Partnerships Vipul Mehrotra said.</p>
