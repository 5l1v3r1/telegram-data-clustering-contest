Energy Drinks Are the Past, but This Nootropic Smart Drink Is the Future
Neurohacker Collective’s Qualia Nootropic Energy drink-shot improves mental performance without drowning your brain in caffeine and sugar.
06 Nov 2019 by Futurism Creative
Energy drinks have exploded into a billion-dollar industry in recent years, as consumers from all walks of life look for ways to enhance their mental performance. Unfortunately, this industry doesn’t have a very good reputation. The vast majority of energy drinks and shots on the market are pretty terrible for you, containing anywhere from 200 to 400 milligrams of caffeine and 30 to 50 grams of sugar per serving. These ingredients will wake you up, but they won’t improve your brain’s performance. The good news, however, is that Neurohacker Collective, one of the most respected names in the nootropics industry, is about to change that. They’ve taken all the premium, scientifically proven brain-boosting ingredients that were previously only available in pill form and put them in Qualia Nootropic Energy, the world’s first true smart drink.

Qualia Nootropic Energy Smart Drink

With just four grams of sugar and the amount of caffeine you’d get in a small cup of coffee, each two-ounce Qualia Nootropic Energy shot is packed with nine researched-backed nootropics, plus three additional ingredients that promote overall health. Together, these ingredients provide clean lasting energy for superior focus and motivation.
Saffron Extract (Crocus sativus)
Saffron is a spice derived from the flowers of the Crocus sativus plant. It’s been used as a spice for at least 4,000 years and is considered the world’s most costly spice by weight. A wide body of research indicates a multitude of diverse health benefits from saffron beyond mental performance. However, when it comes to cognition, there is evidence that saffron supports mood, protects against cognitive impairment, and promotes focus and attention.
Celastrus Paniculatus Seed Extract
Celastrus paniculatus, commonly known as “intellect plant,” is a climbing shrub found throughout the Himalayan highlands of northern India. It has been used as an herb in ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years for its nootropic and neuroprotective effects. Studies show it has the ability to increase the number of lipids and phospholipids in the brain, reduce depression, and protect neurons against glutamate-induced toxicity.
L-Theanine
L-theanine is an amino acid analog of glutamate and glutamine found in green tea derived from the Camellia Sinensis plant. Studies indicate that L-theanine increases alpha brain waves, in turn promoting attention and relaxation without sedation. It can also modulate the release of dopamine, thus improving mood.
Alpha GPC
Alpha-glycerophosphocholine, better known as alpha GPC, is a compound made of choline and glycerophosphate, which have strong neuroprotective effects. Alpha GPC has been shown to increase neural membrane integrity, and is the most effective cholinergic at increasing choline levels in the brain.
Coffeeberry
Coffeeberry is a trademarked and standardized ingredient derived from organic coffee fruits, often called coffee cherries. Coffee plants produce fruits surrounding the hard seed or “bean” from which coffee is made. Coffee cherries are high in polyphenols, and like coffee beans, they also contain caffeine. Many studies indicate coffeeberry’s role in supporting cognitive performance, executive function, task switching, information processing, reasoning, and creative thinking.
N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine
N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine is an acetylated form of the amino acid L-Tyrosine. It has a number of nootropic effects, including increased attention, motivation, concentration, memory, and learning. Studies indicate it has the ability to increase the synthesis of noradrenaline from dopamine and balance levels of serotonin and GABA, increase the bioavailability of tyrosine, and reduce the effects of environmental stress.
American Ginseng (as Cereboost)
Panax quinquefolius, commonly known as American ginseng, is a plant native to forested regions of North America. Cereboost is a trademarked and standardized American ginseng extract that has been clinically studied on humans. Studies indicate that it enhances working memory and attention while promoting calmness, as well as supporting learning and working memory. It has also been shown to support neurogenesis and has neuroprotective effects.
NooLVL
NooLVL is a trademarked inositol-enhanced bonded arginine silicate. It has been shown in studies to upregulate dopamine release, support neurotransmitter signaling, and support performance in complex cognitive tests requiring mental flexibility, processing speed, and executive function.
Alpinia Galanga (as EnXtrA)
Alpinia galanga is a plant native to southeast Asia, and EnXtra is a trademarked and standardized alpinia galanga rhizome extract. ExXtra has been shown in human clinical studies to support mental attention, alertness, and memory.
