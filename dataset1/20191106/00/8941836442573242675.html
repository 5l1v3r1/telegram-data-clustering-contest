      <h1>Lamar Jackson wins AFC Player of the Week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/matthew-paras/" target="_blank">Matthew Paras</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/baltimore-ravens/">Baltimore Ravens</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Lamar Jackson</a> was named AFC Player of the Week on Wednesday for his performance against the New England Patriots. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> scored three touchdowns — one through the air, two on the ground — en route to handing New England its first loss of the season. The victory helped put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> in the MVP conversation as the league’s first-ranked defense had trouble stopping the shifty quarterback.</p>
      <p>This is the second time <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lamar-jackson/">Jackson</a> has won the award this season. He also earned the honor in a Week 1 win over the Miami Dolphins, when he threw five touchdowns. </p>
