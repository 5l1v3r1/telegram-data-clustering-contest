Deputies said they were called shortly before 12:15 p.m. to the Magic Kingdom after Brian Thomas Sherman placed his arm around the costumed character's shoulders and groped her breast.
Sherman and his wife were escorted into a meet and greet area, and they sat on either side of the victim, an arrest report said.
The report said Sherman sat down beside the victim more quickly than she expected.
""This left the victim physically stuck in between the defendant on her left and his wife on her right,"" according to the report.
The report said Sherman repeatedly told the victim that the character she was playing is his favorite, and he placed his arm around her shoulders.
The victim said she was trained to know that it is inappropriate to be photographed with a visitor's arm wrapped around her and that she was uncomfortable but was unable to move, the report said.
It said Sherman moved his arm lower so that he could cup the victim's bra with his hand.



A co-worker could tell that the victim was uncomfortable and told Sherman to change his pose, but he cupped and lifted her breast for several seconds, the report said.
""When the defendant left the room, the victim began shaking and crying,"" the report said.
Deputies said Sherman was identified through a picture taken by a Disney photographer.
He was booked into the Orange County Jail on charges of battery.
Records said Sherman was convicted in 1991 of sexual battery on a victim under 12 in Polk County.
Anyone else whom Sherman might have inappropriately touched is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 407-836-4357.
