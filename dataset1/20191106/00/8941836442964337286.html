      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - When screenwriter Jared Stern was approached about developing Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham” as an animated series, he sought advice from one important woman and the consent of another.</p>
      <p>Stern’s grandmother reminded him how much he loved the book as a child. And the writer’s widow gave her approval to Stern’s idea for adapting the 1960 story. Five years later, the 13-episode series is debuting Friday on Netflix.</p>
      <p>Michael Douglas voices the character who turns up his nose at green eggs and ham, with Adam Devine as Sam-I-Am, who won’t take no for an answer.</p>
      <p>Others in the voice cast include Diane Keaton, Eddie Izzard and Tracy Morgan.</p>
