Ryan Reynolds Trolls Henry Cavill’s Botched ‘Superman’ Mustache In His Gin Ad
06 Nov 2019 by Thanussha Priyah
Famed actor and internet troll Ryan Reynolds made his first DC crossover since Green Goblin in the latest advert for his Aviation Gin label, featuring an apt cameo for Movember—and it’s none other than Henry Cavill’s mustache. The Deadpool actor poked fun at the Superman actor, who had his mustache unimpressively edited out in a multimillion-dollar CGI job as he had to keep his facial hair in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. In the commercial, a mustachioed Reynolds asks, “Does drinking Aviation Gin make you feel like a superhero?” He proceeds to take a sip of the drink, and his mustache disappears. Feigning oblivion, he adds, “I wouldn’t know.” Though Reynolds did not include any Superman reference in the video, it was plain to see that the jab was obviously for Cavill. Advertisement Advertisement The Movember Twitter account reposted the 43-year-old’s clip along with the caption, “You can’t conceal the power of the Mo. #Movember.” Check out the satirical video below.
