Lamar Jackson wins AFC Player of the Week
06 Nov 2019 by Matthew Paras
Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was named AFC Player of the Week on Wednesday for his performance against the New England Patriots. 
Jackson scored three touchdowns — one through the air, two on the ground — en route to handing New England its first loss of the season. The victory helped put Jackson in the MVP conversation as the league’s first-ranked defense had trouble stopping the shifty quarterback.
This is the second time Jackson has won the award this season. He also earned the honor in a Week 1 win over the Miami Dolphins, when he threw five touchdowns. 

The Ravens are 6-2 in 2019, and sit atop the AFC North.
