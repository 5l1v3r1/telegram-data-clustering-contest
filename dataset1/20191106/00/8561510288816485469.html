      <h1>China Is Selling Autonomous Killer Drones to the Middle East</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Killbots</h3>
      <p>Chinese military contractors have already started to sell dangerous, autonomous killer robots to customers in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>For instance, a Chinese company called Ziyan is actively marketing its Blowfish A3 — an autonomous helicopter-like drone armed with a machine gun — to international buyers, <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/11/secdef-china-exporting-killer-robots-mideast/161100/">according to <i>Defense One</i></a>. While several countries have been <a href="https://futurism.com/uk-autonomous-killer-robots">working towards</a> this tech for years, this news means we’re finally, and unfortunately, living in the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/relatively-easy-killer-robots-2021">era of killer robots</a>.</p>
      <h3>Deadly Exports</h3>
      <p>While Ziyan works to sell its autonomous killbots to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the Chinese government is already entrenched in the killer robot trade.</p>
      <p>“As we speak, the Chinese government is already exporting some of its most advanced military aerial drones to the Middle East, as it prepares to export its next-generation stealth UAVs when those come online,” said Defense Secretary Mark Esper, per <i>Defense One</i>. “In addition, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling drones advertised as capable of full autonomy, including the ability to conduct lethal targeted strikes.”</p>
      <h3>Mixed Feelings</h3>
      <p>While <a href="https://futurism.com/scientists-ban-ai-killer-robots">many countries</a> support a ban on fully-autonomous weapons, major military leaders <a href="https://futurism.com/russia-ground-force-armed-military-robots">like Russia</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/us-navy-autonomous-killer-robot-ships">the U.S.</a> have been racing to develop their own killer robots. If Ziyan is telling the truth about its autonomous helicopter drones, it would seem China may have won the race.</p>
      <p>Esper called it troubling that corporations are “inadvertently or tacitly providing the technology or research behind China’s unethical use of AI,” according to <i>Defense One</i>.</p>
