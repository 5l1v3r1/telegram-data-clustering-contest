      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The Latest on two former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/twitter/">Twitter</a> employees charged with accessing personal account information on behalf of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-government/">Saudi government</a>. (all times local):</p>
      <p>3 p.m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/twitter/">Twitter</a> has acknowledged that it cooperated in a U.S. investigation of two former employees accused of accessing personal account information on behalf of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/saudi-government/">Saudi government</a>.</p>
      <p>The social media company said in a statement Wednesday it recognizes “the length bad actors will go to try and undermine” its service, and that there are tools in place to protect users with sensitive accounts.</p>
      <p>The statement came as U.S. prosecutors detailed a coordinated effort by Saudi officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of thousands of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/twitter/">Twitter</a> accounts.</p>

        <p>The complaint unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco detailed a coordinated effort by Saudi officials to recruit employees at the social media giant to look up the private data of thousands of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/twitter/">Twitter</a> accounts.</p>
        <p>The accounts included those of a popular journalist with more than 1 million followers and other prominent government critics.</p>
        <p>It also alleged that the employees - whose jobs did not require access to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/twitter/">Twitter</a> users’ private information - were rewarded with a designer watch and tens of thousands of dollars funneled into secret bank accounts.</p>
