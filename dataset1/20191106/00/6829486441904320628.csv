His Dark Materials premiered last night, and frankly, everyone is gagging about the beautifully lush fantasy world, the strange and grim and wondrous tone, and the stellar performances.

It’s a gorgeous show, truly a product of the golden age of prestige television that we’re currently in, especially the huge fantasy adaptations.
But — that’s not everything that people are gagging about.
Lyra’s mysterious and brilliant uncle is the Lord Asriel, played perfectly by James McAvoy — he has just the right mixture of aggressive genius, and slightly tortured visionary to properly sell the role.
Also, he’s fucking hot. Honestly, this handsome science daddy can photograph me like one of his dust models. He can overthrow my magisterium. He can swaddle me up like a baby and abandon me at a university.
God damn. And I’m not alone in being horny for the magic father/uncle.





















But there’s two choices that’s been made for his interpretation of the character that have people specifically going off.
His wide range of beautiful knitwear is the first. Honestly, I would die for a man in a nice jum-jum. Let’s put this baby in a turtleneck and then watch me expire from the combo of hotness and comfort.



And the other thing? Why it’s only the sexy streak of grey in his hair, reminiscent of nothing more than The Nanny’s Mr Sheffield. Fran Fine is losing her shit! CC Babcock is burying herself in a shallow grave.






Also, people are making fun of his obsession with “dust” and it’s very funny. Nice to take a break from being horny!






His Dark Materials is currently streaming on Foxtel Now.
