【守護神威士忌（下）】打造純正精神　堅持站在樹梢的貓頭鷹

06 Nov 2019, 00:58

知名威士忌作家Dave Broom的《世界威士忌地圖》第13頁，寫道：「蘇格蘭單麥威士忌、波本、愛爾蘭及加拿大等威士忌各擁天地，不過瑞典、台灣、澳洲、荷蘭和美國的精釀威士忌，也都找到了新的領地。」書中也介紹了不落人後的比利時貓頭鷹威士忌。








當年調酒師Etienne Bouillon承襲家族蒸餾水果酒的經驗，以第4代傳人之姿帶著團隊來到蘇格蘭艾雷島的布萊迪酒廠學習，受教於當時有「神級釀酒師」之稱的酒廠首席調酒師Jim McEwan。
透過蘇格蘭的技術，以及日後從蘇格蘭Caperdonich酒廠搬來的蒸餾器，取材比利時當地的大麥，當地優良水質，全程手工製作，期待打造出純正比利時精神且能享譽全球的威士忌。














酒廠成立10年後，該威士忌登上台灣舞台時僅進口2款，知名度不大，加上新世界風不標榜年分，因此銷售不易。但這回我前往酒廠直擊，發現這幾年貓頭鷹產線更齊備，產品更成熟且獲獎增多，外觀結合比利時歐洲漫畫之都的元素，一路的堅持像站在森林樹梢上的貓頭鷹雙眼，眼光獨具充滿智慧。

[Guardian Whiskey (below)] Create a pure spirit. Owl standing in the treetops

06 Nov 2019, 00:58

On the 13th page of the famous whisky writer Dave Broom's World Whiskey Map, ""Scotch Maldives, Bourbon, Ireland and Canada are all whisky, but crafted whiskies from Sweden, Taiwan, Australia, the Netherlands and the United States. They have also found new territories."" The book also introduces the Belgian Owl whiskey after the fall.








In the same year, the bartender Etienne Bouillon inherited the experience of family distilled fruit wine, and took the team to the Brady winery in Isle of Eile, Scotland, in the fourth generation. He was taught at the time as a “God-level winemaker”. Jim McEwan, chief bartender at the winery.
Through Scottish technology, and the distillers that were later moved from the Caperdonich winery in Scotland, the local Belgian barley, the local fine water quality, hand-crafted throughout, is expected to create a purely Belgian spirit and a world-famous whisky.














Ten years after the establishment of the winery, the whisky was only imported 2 when it was on the Taiwan stage. The popularity was not high, and the new world wind was not listed as a year, so sales were not easy. But this time I went straight to the winery and found that the owl line was more complete in the past few years, the products were more mature and the prizes increased. The appearance combined with the elements of the Belgian European comic capital, all the way to the owl eyes standing on the forest treetops The vision is full of wisdom.
