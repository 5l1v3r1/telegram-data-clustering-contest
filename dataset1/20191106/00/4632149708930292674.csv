Actress Lasya Nagaraj is making a special appearance in Krishna Talkies. She participated in the shooting of a special song for the film last week. Ajai Rao, Chikkanna and over 50 dancers were part of the shoot at a set erected at a city studio. Lasya who made a mark playing the lead role in Asatoma Sadgamaya followed it up with successful appearance in television reality shows. Her classical dancing background helped her in dance reality shows. She also appeared in Tamil television. The biggest news so far this year for the actress was her selection to act in the web series Midnight's Children. Now she returns to Kannada screen with Krishna Talkies albeit in a special song. Bhushan choreographed the song, 'Nighti maatra haakabeda Menaka,' is written by Abhishek and Pramod Maravanthe. The film is directed by Vijayanand. Untitled Carousel



‘I am proud of what I have done in Damayanthi’This time, Radhika Kumaraswamy has not one but two films making their way to the audience. Her home production Bhairadevi and Damayanthi are both supernatural thrillers.
