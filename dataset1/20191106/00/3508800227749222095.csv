土城三峽立委選情膠著，與新潮流較勁的「正國會」可能再少一席
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是在三峽土城選區，藍綠候選人均屬於不善於媒體表現的地方型政治人物，陸軍的增長也有限，反倒是擅長空戰的李縉穎吸票能力佳，可能拉下有知名度不足隱憂的現任立委。



文：紀齊修（輿情分析師）
根據典通在10月20至21日所做的三峽土城選區民調，現任民進黨吳琪銘的知名度低於競爭對手國民黨林金結，有35.53%的民眾知道林金結要選立委，卻只有33.77%的民眾知道現任立委吳琪銘要競選連任，而距離調查日期不到一個月前宣佈投入該區選戰的民眾黨創黨黨員李縉穎，在民調中獲得8.47%民眾的認知度，不可小覷。但是該區也有54.42%的民眾表示都沒聽過任何人，顯然超過一半的民眾不知道該區有哪些立委候選人，表示該區還很有宣傳爭取的空間。
民進黨近年逐漸形成正國會與新潮流的對決，而現任閣揆蘇貞昌所帶領的蘇系更已經與新潮流結盟，回顧民進黨黨內派系新潮流與正國會從十多年前游錫堃擔任黨主席、林佳龍擔任秘書長時的「11寇之仇」到去年2018的地方選舉廝殺得「流血流滴」，有黨內人士表示新潮流「君子報仇十年不晚」，新系終於等到報仇機會。
如今，正國會在新北三重參選的余天遇到出身蘇系脫黨參選的李旻蔚而身陷苦戰，正國會另一成員吳琪銘雖也為現任立委，卻因為知名度不高，選情與對手林金結呈現膠著，若民進黨三重整合無望，余天選情無法明朗，知名度低的吳琪銘恐怕會遭正國會棄保，轉將資源投入全力搶救余天，力保一席。
藍綠民調麻花膠著，第三勢力可能成為選舉結果關鍵
若看兩人的支持度，吳琪銘以34.79%險勝林金結的33.95%，勝負居於誤差範圍內，李縉穎與代表喜樂島參選的楊詩龍則分別獲得4.93%和0.37%，其它仍有將近21.95的未表態。有趣的是，該份民調還調查了已經表態不參選總統的郭台銘、柯文哲，郭董與柯市長的總統支持度分別是13.77%、5.95%，顯見郭董在鴻海公司根據地的土城大本營還有極高的民意支持度，但是很可惜的未能移轉給披掛郭家軍參選的李縉穎。

至少從這個數據來看，沒有「母雞」、沒有政黨奧援的候選人很難殺出重圍。
但更值得觀察的是，現任立委吳琪銘與挑戰者林金結的民調差距不大，對比該份民調蔡英文以36.56%勝過韓國瑜30.98%的差距，形成「政黨支持度大於立委本人」的奇異狀況，吳琪銘的連任之路顯然充滿不確定性。分析其背後原因，吳琪銘從蘇系短暫跳轉英派，現在屬於正國會系統，與挑戰者林金結均屬於不善於媒體表現的地方型政治人物，加上面對膠著的選情，不擅長空戰的吳琪銘和林金結，陸軍的增長也有限，反倒是擅長空戰的李縉穎如果稍稍點燃一點火花，帶對風向，反將成為左右選情的關鍵。
回顧上一屆立委選戰，當時的柯市長是幫吳琪銘站台助選的，但四年後的今天柯市長勢必會輔選自家的民眾黨創黨黨員的李縉穎，對於陷入苦戰的吳琪銘將如芒刺在背，對於正國會來說更是屋漏偏逢連夜雨，可能無暇分身解救，可能造成正國會在新北勢力再消退一席的危機。

The Tucheng Three Gorges legislators are in love with each other, and there may be one more seats in the ""Congress"" that competes with the new trend.
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by readers


What we want you to know is that in the Three Gorges Tucheng Constituency, the blue and green candidates are local politicians who are not good at media performance. The Army’s growth is also limited. On the contrary, Li Yuying, who is good at air combat, has good ability to attract votes and may draw down popularity. Incumbent legislators who are not enough to worry about.



Text: Ji Qixiu (sentimental analyst)
According to the poll of the Three Gorges Tucheng Constituency, which was written by Octopus on October 20-21, the current DPP Wu Qiming is less well-known than the rival Kuomintang Lin Jinjie, and 35.53% of the people know that Lin Jinjie wants to choose a legislator. Only 33.77% of the people know that the current legislator Wu Qiming wants to run for re-election, and the Liberal Party party member Li Yuying, who announced that he has been involved in the election campaign in the district less than a month ago, has gained 8.47% public awareness in the polls. Don't be underestimated. However, 54.42% of the people in the district have said that they have never heard of anyone. Apparently more than half of the people do not know which legislators are in the district, indicating that there is still room for publicity in the district.
In recent years, the DPP has gradually formed a confrontation between the congress and the new trend. The current Soviet Union led by Su Shichang has already formed an alliance with the new trend. It recalls the new trend of the DPP party faction and the official congress from more than ten years ago. When the party chairman and Lin Jialong served as the secretary-general, the ""11-year-old revenge"" was smothered by the local elections in 2018 last year. Some people inside the party said that the new trend ""the gentleman revenge is not too late"", the new department finally Wait until the opportunity for revenge.
Nowadays, the Congress is in the midst of the three-time election of the New North. Li Weiwei, who was born in the Soviet Union’s election, is in a difficult battle. Another member of the National Assembly, Wu Qiming, is also a current legislator, but because of his low popularity, his choice and opponents. Lin Jinjie is glued. If the Democratic Progressive Party’s triple integration is hopeless, Yu Tian’s election will be unclear. Wu Qiming, who is not well-known, will probably be abandoned by the National Congress. He will invest resources to spare the rest of the day and protect him.
Blue and green polls are twisted, and the third force may become the key to the election results.
If you look at the support of the two people, Wu Qiming wins 33.95% of Lin Jinjie with 34.79%, and the winners and losers are within the error range. Li Yuying and Yang Shilong, who represent Joy Island, respectively, get 4.93% and 0.37%, and the others still have nearly 21.95. Not stated. Interestingly, the poll also surveyed Guo Taiming and Ke Wenzhe who had already stated that they did not run for the presidency. The presidential support of Guo Dong and Ke Mayor were 13.77% and 5.95% respectively. It is obvious that Guo Dong is in the Tucheng Base Camp of the Hon Hai Company Base. There is also a very high degree of public support, but it is a pity that it has not been transferred to Li Yuying, who is in the election of Guo Jiajun.

At least from this data, it is difficult for a candidate who does not have a ""hen"" or a political aid from a political party to break through.
But what is more worthy of observation is that the gap between the current legislator Wu Qiming and the challenger Lin Jinjie is not big. Compared with the poll, Tsai Ing-wen beats 30.96% of the gap of South Korea's Yu 30.98%, forming a ""party support is greater than Li The singularity of the committee itself, Wu Qiming’s re-election is obviously full of uncertainty. Analysis of the reasons behind it, Wu Qiming briefly jumped from the Soviet Union to the British School, now belongs to the Central Congress system, and the challenger Lin Jinjie is a local politician who is not good at media performance, and is not good at air combat in the face of a glued election. Wu Qiming and Lin Jinjie, the army's growth is also limited, but Li Qiying, who is good at air combat, if he ignites a little spark and brings the wind direction, it will become the key to the election.
Looking back at the last legislature's election campaign, the mayor of Ke was helping Wu Qiming to help the platform. But four years later, the mayor of Ke is bound to be assisted by Li Yuying, a member of the party's founding party, for Wu Qiming who is in a hard fight. The thorns are on the back. For the congress, it is even more that the house leaks and the night rains may be innocent, and it may cause a crisis in which the New Taipei forces will once again recede.
