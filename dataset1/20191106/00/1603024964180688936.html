      <p>Husqvarna has displayed its range of motorcycles at the ongoing EICMA 2019. The Swedish motorcycle manufacturer displayed the brand-new Norden 901 Adventure motorcycle, which is based on KTM’s parallel-twin platform.</p>
      <p>The motorcycle features Husqvarna’s signature neo-retro design language, with design inspiration from early 90s Dakar rally machines. It gets a tall windscreen, a round LED headlamp and LED turn indicators which are integrated into the fairing. The motorcycle also gets flared lower belly panels, which protect it against harmful debris and rubble.</p>
      <p>Husqvarna has also equipped the motorcycle with a fully coloured digital instrument console with phone connectivity, a high mounted exhaust canister, mounting points for panniers and knuckle guards and a LED taillight.</p>

      <p>Since Husqvarna is a KTM in fancy clothes, the Norden 901 gets the 890 Duke’s 900cc liquid-cooled parallel-twin motor. The company is yet to unveil the motorcycle’s power figures, but it can be expected that KTM will make the engine Euro-5 and BSVI compliant.</p>
      <p>The company has not made any official announcements about the motorcycle’s launch in the international markets hence it can be safely assumed that the motorcycle is also a long way from India. However, Husqvarna will be introducing the Svartpilen and Vitpilen 401 to India soon.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
