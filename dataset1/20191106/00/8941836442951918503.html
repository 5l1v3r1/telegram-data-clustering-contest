      <p>CINCINNATI (AP) - An Ohio sheriff plans to update the investigation into the ownership of a sword wielded in the American Revolution and by a future president in the War of 1812.</p>
      <p>Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Neil scheduled a news conference Wednesday about the sword linked to William Henry Harrison and before him, his future father-in-law, Continental Army Col. John Cleves Symmes.</p>
      <p>Police in Connecticut seized the sword last month, just hours before it was going up for auction with a $15,000 minimum bid.</p>
      <p>Members of the Harrison-Symmes Memorial Foundation some 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Cincinnati suspect it is a historical sword that disappeared 40 years ago from the Cincinnati Historical Society.</p>

        <p>The would-be seller says that he believes his sword is authentic and that the Cincinnati sword was a copy.</p>
