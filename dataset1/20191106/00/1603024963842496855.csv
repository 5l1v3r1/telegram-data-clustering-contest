Since the motorcycle is a brand-new concept from the company, it also gets a completely new Revolution Max 1250cc, 60-degree V-twin liquid-cooled and counterbalanced engine. (Image: Harley Davidson)



It is expected to make 147PS of maximum power and 122Nm of peak torque and should be mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. The company also states that it has made the engine narrower and is being used as a stressed member to support its chassis. (Image: Harley Davidson)

The company has also collaborated with Brembo to create a new, 4-piston monoblock caliper to provide optimum braking. It also gets inverted forks and a rear monoshock. (Image: Harley Davidson)



Harley Davidson has not made any official announcements about the launch of the motorcycle in India, though it can be expected to arrive by 2021. (Image: Harley Davidson)



It will be pitted against the KTM 1290 Super Adventure R, BMW R 1250 GS Adventure, Triumph Tiger 1200 XCx and Ducati Multistrada 1260 Enduro. (Image: Harley Davidson)
