        <b>BRIAN Quigley / CEO partner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Warren Bobrow=WB: What obstacles do you face in business? How do you foresee removing them?</p>
      <p>Brian Quigley=BQ: Over my 20+ years in business, one of the biggest obstacles I continue to see is bias and close mindedness prevents C-Suite leaders from making sound strategic decisions.  Leaders from other industries market need to be open to multiple points of view and they need to embrace thinking that is different from their own to truly make sound strategic decisions in an industry that is evolving daily.  </p>
      <p><i>There are three things we’ve done in the creation of Green Sky that more teams need to embrace to combat this</i>:</p>
      <p>1) Surround yourself with diverse and  “out of the box thinking” people with diverse backgrounds to see issues from multiple perspectives.  </p>
      <p>2) Listen more and talk less  - work hard at practicing your active listening</p>
      <p>3) Take the time to inspect, reinspect and recreate your strategy on a continuous basis.  Especially in cannabis, there is still to much believe that if you simply “ build it...they will come.”  People coming in from other industries also feel like they can’t waste time with “planning” because of the speed of the growing marketplace; they believe that they need to have a footprint without tying in the foundation needed to support that “footprint”.  The opposite is true. A little time applied to a strong strategic process will allow you to combat stasis and drive innovation, change and different perspectives.</p>
      <p>WB: What are your six month and twelve-month goal? </p>
      <p>BQ: My six-month goal is to build the reputation and reach of Green Sky Strategy as THE strategic thought leader for CEO’s who need a <i>cannabis-focused strategy.</i></p>
      <p>In a year,  I hope to look back with Jim, Ophelia, Chris, and Pete and feel proud of the positive impact we’ve made in moving this industry forward towards its next leg of growth.</p>
      <p>WB: What is your favorite restaurant  </p>
      <p>BQ: Edo’s Squid,  Richmond, VA</p>
      <p>WB: What is your passion?</p>
      <p> BQ: Being a father to my three sons, a husband and looking after my 180 lb. Mastiff “Blaze”.</p>

      <p>Warren Bobrow=WB: What obstacles do you face in business? How do you foresee removing them?</p>
      <p>Pete Diatelevi=PD: Biggest obstacles will likely be in 2 areas:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A lack of executive talent as companies move out of very early start-up phase seasoned executives that understand how to shape and navigate the regulatory environment will be a key to success.  In addition, these executives have to be skilled at balancing entrepreneurship to proven infrastructure, processes, and systems.</li>
        <li> Consumer understanding and safety of Hemp and THC.  Balanced regulation developed by multiple stakeholders will be necessary for the industry to flourish </li>
      </ol>
      <p>WB: What are your six month and twelve-month goal?</p>
      <p>PD: Deploying Green Sky Strategies team with their diverse skill sets to as many clients as possible to help them reach their full potential </p>
      <p>WB: What is your favorite restaurant  </p>

      <p>Warren Bobrow=WB: What obstacles do you face in business? How do you foresee removing them?</p>
      <p>Jim McAlpine=JM: We face a widespread societal misunderstanding of the cannabis industry and the plant that the industry is based upon. I work tirelessly to help reframe the cannabis plant and the people that use it in a different and positive light.</p>
      <p>-With our clients, they face an ever-changing industry with a very confusing legal landscape. We work to help them stay up to date with all the inundating information related to being compliant with the everchanging legalities of the industry.</p>
      <p>WB: What are your six month and twelve-month goal? </p>
      <p>JM: The six-month goal is to continue to grow and scale our company to bring on more employees to keep up with the demand for our services. -Twelve months’ goal is to be looked at as THE most relevant consulting firm in the space and look back upon several success stories of our clients in 2020. </p>
      <p>WB: What is your favorite restaurant  </p>
      <p>JM: Sushi Ron - Sausalito, CA</p>
      <p>WB: What is your passion? </p>

        <b>CHRIS HUSONG HEAD OF MARKETING AND SALES STRATEGY</b>
      </p>
      <p>WB: What obstacles do you face in business?</p>
      <p>Chris Husong=CH: Obstacles I have faced are all based on a lack of education or misperceptions. Whether it is the programming I myself received on an institutional level that cannabis was a drug and would fry your brain like an egg and to just say no, or that cannabis is a sin and gateway drug.</p>
      <p>WB: How do you foresee removing them?</p>
      <p>CH: Removing these obstacles takes time, patients and meeting people where they are at with compassion and the truth about cannabis. The truth is that it should be treated not like plutonium but like both medicine for some and craft beer for others. It heals and adds happiness to people’s lives. </p>
      <p>WB: What are your six month and twelve-month goal?</p>
      <p>CH: My 6-month goal is to help all our customers have a great Q4 to Q1/2020.  My 12-month goal is to create a campaign that honors the cannabis legends and leaders that have brought us to this point. A claim that helps educate inform and inspire our future leaders and helps to reform our poorly crafted cannabis legal landscape.</p>
      <p>WB: What is your favorite restaurant  </p>
      <p>CH: My favorite restaurant depends on the time of day, I most frequently go to choice juicery and Lazy acres in my hometown. However, l love to find new places like Jajaja in NY or Equinox cafe in DC.</p>
      <p>WB: What is your passion? My passion is simply to learn and improve myself, my family and my global community each day. More specifically helping my adult kids on their journey and my English bulldog Chunk is my daily joy.</p>

      <p>WB: What is your passion? </p>
      <p>Ophelia Chong=OC: Originally I thought being female and Asian would be hampering my progress in cannabis as it had done in my past careers. However, I found acceptance and support that are not present in another industry. I am working to remove the stereotyping and misinformation in my own community, Asian Americans. I am doing this by bringing the best and the brightest in cannabis to speak about their stories and how cannabis is beneficial rather than harming as the propaganda has been the last century. <a href="http://www.asianamericansforcannabis.org/">You can read about my fellow cannabis APIs, here</a>.</p>
      <p>My six-month goal is to grow Green Sky by taking on both large and small clients and to hire a diverse set of sub-contractors to create marketing campaigns. My year-end goal is to look back and say “we did well.” My five-year goal is to have Green Sky Strategy acquired by a larger corporation to help bring our culture and communities to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>My favorite restaurant is my freezer because I don’t have time to cook nor socialize, the industry is such that taking a breath means you are a step behind. It may sound horrible but it has saved me money and my microwave and I are BFFs.</p>
      <p>My passion is to create a new ecosystem for people who entered the cannabis and hemp industry with only the dollars in their pocket and a great idea. We need to support the people who were braver than most to enter, we need to help them sustain their businesses by giving them a leg up with our help.</p>
