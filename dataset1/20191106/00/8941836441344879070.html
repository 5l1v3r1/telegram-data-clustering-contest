      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Two days into the free agent market, the players’ association already is angry at a club.</p>
      <p>Union head Tony Clark issued a statement Wednesday in response to remarks attributed to Atlanta Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos during a conference call with media.</p>
      <p>“Every day you get more information. And we’ve had time to connect with 27 of the clubs - obviously the Astros and (Nationals) being in the World Series, they were tied up - but we had a chance to get a sense of what the other clubs are going to look to do in free agency, who might be available in trades,” Anthopoulos said, according to the union.</p>
      <p>Baseball’s labor contract prohibits clubs from acting in concert in free agent negotiations. The union filed a collusion grievance following the 2017-18 offseason.</p>
      <p>“The statements made by Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos call into the question the integrity of the entire free-agent system,” Clark said in a statement Wednesday. “The clear description of club coordination is egregious, and we have launched an immediate investigation looking into the matter.”</p>
