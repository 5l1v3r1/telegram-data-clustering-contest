Topline: In today’s era of increased scrutiny and calls for regulation around data privacy, security breaches are bad news for both corporations and consumers, often having a negative effect on a company’s stock price—although that impact has decreased in recent years as Wall Street becomes used to more frequent data breaches.

A new study from technology research firm Comparitech analyzed 28 different big-name companies that have experienced a data breach of at least 1 million records leaked, ranging from Apple and Facebook to Capital One and JPMorgan Chase.
The report finds that share prices fell 7.27% on average after a data breach, hitting a low point almost three weeks later, with those that leak highly sensitive information—like credit card and social security numbers—unsurprisingly leading to greater drops in a company’s share price.
The size of a breach does not directly correlate to bigger drops in stock prices, however; companies that had the most records exposed saw their stock actually recover and outperform the market, while companies with smaller breaches saw their shares struggle in the six months after the fact.
Older breaches, those before 2012, like TJ Maxx or Sony, surprisingly met with stronger negative reactions from Wall Street than more recent ones like Adobe or Equifax. Increasingly common data breaches in recent years have have led to a “breach fatigue” effect—where the market is less shaken by them as time goes on, according to the study.
Breached companies underperform the market in the long term, growing 8.38% on average over the following year but still trailing the Nasdaq by 6.5%, Comparitech’s report finds, although that impact diminishes over time.
The consequences of a breach on a company’s share prices varies by sector, but finance and payment companies were the hardest hit, while healthcare and retail companies were the least affected.

Surprising fact: Companies that experienced a breach actually performed better in the six months after, with average share price growing by 7.4%, compared to 4.1% growth in the six months before.
Tangent: Even major outages can affect stock prices. Bank of America, for instance, had an outage last week that left thousands of customers locked out of their accounts for over an hour, resulting in a nearly 2% drop in its share price.
