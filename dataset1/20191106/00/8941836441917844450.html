      <h1>Schalke chairman back to work following racist comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">CIARÁN FAHEY</a></address>
      <p>BERLIN (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/schalke/">Schalke</a> chairman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clemens-tonnies/">Clemens Tönnies</a> will resume his duties on Thursday following a three-month break after making racist comments in August.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga team said Wednesday that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tonnies-group/">Tönnies</a>‘ scheduled comeback is “a return that the club’s committees expressly welcome.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clemens-tonnies/">Tönnies</a> had stepped down in response to anger and condemnation of comments he made at a public meeting in Paderborn on Aug. 1, when he said tax increases to fight climate change were wrong and that it was better to finance 20 power plants a year in Africa.</p>
      <p>“Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees, and they would stop making babies when it gets dark,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clemens-tonnies/">Tönnies</a> said in comments first reported by the Neue Westfälische local newspaper.</p>
      <p>The German soccer federation said it concurred with the general consensus that the comments were racist, but that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tonnies-group/">Tönnies</a> “was able to convincingly show that he was not a racist during the in-depth hearing and questioning.”</p>

      <p>“Irrespective of its classification as racist or discriminatory, the sentence used by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clemens-tonnies/">Mr. Tönnies</a> is a violation of the German soccer federation’s principles,” the federation’s ethics committee said.</p>
      <p>Many Schalke fans had called on the 63-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tonnies-group/">Tönnies</a> to resign despite his apology for the comments, which were widely condemned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/clemens-tonnies/">Tönnies</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/schalke/">Schalke</a> chairman since 2001, had been speaking as head of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tonnies-group/">Tönnies Group</a>, a meat-processing food giant with about 16,500 employees that specializes in the slaughter of pigs and cattle. The group posted revenues of 6.65 billion euros ($7.45 billion) last year.</p>
