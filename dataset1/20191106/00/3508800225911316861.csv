人類起源的故鄉找到了？這篇論文堪稱「過度解讀」的負面教材
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by 精選轉載


我們想讓你知道的是現代粒線體型號的分佈，到底能不能代表古代族群，其實沒人知道。這個論文研究的又是相當稀有的型號，我猜這方面問題只會更大。

人類起源的「故鄉」終於找到了！科學家今天表示，人類祖先是在距今20萬年前誕生於非洲的波札那北部，當地現遍布沙漠和鹽地，但20萬年前卻是廣大的湖泊溼地，生機盎然。──《風傳媒》研究人員使用遺傳學及氣候模型對基因進行分析，描繪出20萬年前非洲大陸的狀況......但一位專家對發表在《自然》雜誌上的這項研究持謹慎態度。他說，你不能僅憑線粒體DNA重建人類起源的故事。──《BBC》
〈Human origins in a southern African palaeo-wetland and first migrations〉這篇2019年的論文發表在《自然》（Nature）以後，引發一批人類演化學家一陣劣評，我覺得很有道理。我看完這個研究自己發的新聞稿，覺得講法非常落伍，再看論文覺得，天啊這群人是認真的嗎？他們寫自己論文的同時，有讀過別人的作品，稍微跟上現在的趨勢嗎？
用粒線體差異研究人類的演化遺傳史，從1980年代起引起重視，也是支持智人非洲起源的有力證據。然而，粒線體只是一小部分的遺傳，在定序基因組、甚至是古代基因組的技術都成熟以後，分析粒線體當然還是有其價值，也有基因組不可取代的功能，可是不該過度解讀。這個論文，做出很糟糕的示範。
南非人類原鄉？落伍遺傳學，粒線體不能這樣用
簡單說，這個論文獲得198位南非人的粒線體DNA，大部分型號屬於「L0」（註1）旗下。粒線體單倍群L0之所以重要，是因為這是目前仍然存在，最早與其他人分家的單倍群，可以讓我們一瞥古早智人支系的樣貌。
取得非洲人的遺傳樣本很不容易，材料難得，大概是《自然》接受這個投稿的原因。然而這個論文的分析與論述方式，卻彷彿20年前的手筆。
論文估計L0旗下各衍生型號的分家年代，然後對應到現代的地理分佈，按照各型號的誕生年代，推論古早智人的遷徙路線與年代。按照論文的講法，最初的L0能追溯到非洲南部現在很乾燥、但是古時候是濕地區的馬加迪卡迪湖（Makgadikgadi–Okavango）。智人20萬年前就在那兒誕生，延續約7萬年；接著隨氣候變化向外遷徙，有人先向東北，有人後往西南。
除了最基本的粒線體不等於人體以外，這個論文的問題還有不少，很適合作為負面教材。另一項基本問題是，一個型號現在在這裡，幾十萬年前也會在同樣的位置嗎？
粒線體本身是單一遺傳標記，有一定的消失機率，也容易被遺傳交流後的另一群人取代；西班牙胡瑟裂谷43萬年前的尼安德塔人，粒線體卻比較像是丹尼索瓦人就是明證。
現代粒線體型號的分佈，到底能不能代表古代族群，其實沒人知道。這個論文研究的又是相當稀有的型號，我猜這方面問題只會更大。

43萬年前胡瑟裂谷化石，DNA更接近尼安德塔人
有些遺傳學者認為，像是粒線體、Y染色體、特定基因版本等等單一標記，只適合研究比較短期，單純的遺傳史，不適合用來追溯長期，牽涉複雜情遺傳交流的演化史，我覺得非常有道理。
還有一個問題是，論文混用了一個概念：「解剖學上的現代人」，英文是anatomically modern human，簡稱AMH。AMH是現在流行的講法，因為智人Homo sapiens嚴格說起來，有「物種」的定義，但是人類何時變成「智人」非常有爭議，因此許多人改用AMH。意思大概就是「我的意思是指『智人』，但是不想涉及物種爭議」。
然而，粒線體DNA是遺傳概念，AMH是型態概念（註2），兩者沒有直接關係。論文卻直接把AMH描述為配備L0粒線體衍生型號，即現在的智人祖先。我覺得這樣講問題很大，事實上沒有人知道一位配備L0的古早人類，究竟是不是AMH。完全也有可能所謂AMH的多數型態，是其他族群發展出來，後來又跟配備L0的女生合體，才形成現在的狀況。
一個論文中有這些疏漏，若是發表在一些名不見經傳的期刊，沒有太多人會讀到也就算了。但是發表在《自然》，那就難怪人類演化界出現許多負評聲浪。
我覺得論文作者解釋再多也沒意義，她們寫的就是這個意思：「非洲南部20萬年前的某處，是智人的原鄉。」但是此一論點絕對是錯誤的，有項很簡單的證據反駁：智人現存最早分家的Y染色體，目前位於西非。
另外由訪問中可以判斷，至少頭牌作者Vanessa Hayes完全搞錯，並誤用了AMH的概念：
「Hayes said that she’s focused specifically on anatomically modern humans, whom she calls Homo sapiens sapiens.」
假如你自己做研究，獲得稀有材料，寫出來的論文，不妨試試投稿《自然》吧！
註釋

粒線體是細胞中的胞器，有自己的一套DNA，總共1萬6千核苷酸長。粒線體是母系遺傳，由母親傳給女兒與兒子（最近發現有稀有的例外，不過平時不用特別提），因此每個人都直接繼承媽媽的粒線體DNA。DNA有時候會突變，沒什麼危害的話會保留下來，繼續一代一代傳承。所以根據不同的人的粒線體DNA彼此的差異，就能判斷突變們產生的先後次序；依此可以定義出不同「單倍群」和更細的「單倍型」，方便描述彼此的關係。智人，根據粒線體上某幾個特定DNA位置，可以得知最早分出兩大群，一群是這個研究著重的L0，其他則歸類為L1到L6。依此類推，被歸類為L0的人，又陸續有不同的改變順序，可以分成L0d、L0k、L0f等等，然後繼續細分下去。
每個智人大致上都差不多，但是研究與敘述特定議題時，要找一些有差別的特徵，把不同群歸類。「遺傳概念」意思是人類的差異是以DNA定義，像是這邊是用粒線體DNA，這個人是L0，那個人是L3......「型態概念」是用不同人之間，骨頭、牙齒等人體材料，型態上的差異來分群。兩個粒線體DNA都是L0的人，型態不見得都一樣；反之亦然。

Found in the hometown of human origin? This paper is a negative textbook for ""over-interpretation""
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by Featured Reprint


What we want you to know is the distribution of modern mitochondrial models. Can you represent the ancient ethnic group? No one knows. This paper is also a very rare model, I guess the problem will only be bigger.



Text: Blind-eyed Neanderthal Stonesmith
The ""hometown"" of human origin has finally been found! Scientists said today that human ancestors were born in northern Botswana in Africa 200,000 years ago. The area is now spread over deserts and salt fields, but it was a vast lake wetland 200,000 years ago. -- ""Wind Media"" researchers use genetics and climate models to analyze genes and map out the situation on the African continent 200,000 years ago... but one expert published the study in Nature. Be cautious. He said that you can't reconstruct the story of human origin from mitochondrial DNA alone. ─ ""BBC""
""Human origins in a southern African palaeo-wetland and first migrations"" This 2019 paper published in Nature, triggered a group of human evolutionists to make a bad comment, I think it makes sense. After reading the press release I made myself in this study, I feel that the teaching is very outdated. I think the paper is, is this group of people serious? When they write their own papers, have they read other people's works, and have they kept up with the current trend?
The study of human evolutionary genetic history using mitochondrial differences has attracted attention since the 1980s and is a strong evidence supporting the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa. However, mitochondria are only a small part of the inheritance. After the techniques of sequencing genomes and even ancient genomes are mature, the analysis of mitochondria certainly has its value, but also has the irreplaceable function of the genome, but it should not be over-interpreted. This paper makes a very bad demonstration.
South African human origin? Falling genetics, mitochondria cannot be used like this
Simply put, this paper has access to 198 mitochondrial DNA from South Africans, most of which belong to ""L0"" (Note 1). The mitochondrial haplogroup L0 is important because it is still a singular group that is still the first to be separated from other people, allowing us to see the appearance of the ancient early Homo sapiens.
It is not easy to obtain genetic samples of Africans, and the materials are rare. It is probably the reason why Nature accepts this submission. However, the analysis and discussion of this paper is like a handwritten 20 years ago.
The paper estimates the age of each derivative model of L0, and then corresponds to the geographical distribution of modern times. According to the birth date of each model, the migration route and age of the ancient early Homo sapiens are inferred. According to the paper, the original L0 can be traced back to the Makgadikgadi–Okavango, which is now very dry in southern Africa but is in a wet area in ancient times. The Homo sapiens were born there 200,000 years ago, lasting about 70,000 years; then they migrated with the climate change, some first to the northeast, some to the southwest.
In addition to the most basic mitochondria is not equal to the human body, there are still many problems in this paper, which is very suitable as a negative textbook. Another basic question is, is a model now here, and will it be in the same position hundreds of thousands of years ago?
The mitochondria itself is a single genetic marker with a certain probability of disappearance, and is easily replaced by another group of people after genetic communication; the Neanderthal people of the Spanish Hussein Rift 430,000 years ago, the mitochondria are more like Dan The Nisova people are proof.
The distribution of modern mitochondrial models can not represent the ancient ethnic groups, but no one knows. This paper is also a very rare model, I guess the problem will only be bigger.


The author's view of the migration direction and age of human ancestors Source: Human origins in a southern African palaeo-wetland and first migrations

4,400 years ago, the Hussein rift fossil, the DNA is closer to the Neanderthal
Some geneticists believe that single markers such as mitochondria, Y chromosomes, specific gene versions, etc. are only suitable for studying short-term, simple genetic history, not suitable for retrospective long-term, involving the evolutionary history of complex emotional communication, I think Very reasonable.
Another problem is that the paper mixes a concept: ""anatomically modern people"", English is anatomically modern human, referred to as AMH. AMH is a popular saying now, because Homo sapiens, a sapiens, strictly defines the definition of ""species,"" but it is very controversial when humans become ""smart people,"" so many people switch to AMH. The meaning is probably ""I mean ""smart person"", but I don't want to involve species disputes.""
However, mitochondrial DNA is a genetic concept and AMH is a type concept (Note 2), which is not directly related. The paper directly describes AMH as a model with L0 mitochondria derived, which is now the ancestor of Homo sapiens. I think this is a big problem. In fact, no one knows whether an ancient human with L0 is AMH. It is also possible that the majority of the so-called AMH types were developed by other ethnic groups, and later they were combined with girls equipped with L0 to form the current situation.
There are these omissions in a paper. If it is published in some unseen journals, not many people will read it. But published in ""Nature"", it is no wonder that there have been many negative comments in the evolutionary world.
I think the authors of the paper have no more meaning to explain. They write this meaning: ""Some places in southern Africa 200,000 years ago were the hometown of Homo sapiens."" But this argument is absolutely wrong, and it is very simple. Evidence rebuttal: The earliest separated Y chromosome of Homo sapiens is currently located in West Africa.
In addition, it can be judged by the interview that at least the head author Vanessa Hayes is completely mistaken and misuses the concept of AMH:
""Hayes said that she’s focused specifically on anatomically modern humans, whom she calls Homo sapiens sapiens.""
If you do research yourself, get rare materials, and write a paper, try contributing ""Nature""!
Comment

The mitochondria are the organelles in the cell and have their own set of DNA, which is 16,000 kilograms long. The mitochondria are maternally inherited, passed from mother to daughter and son (recently found rare exceptions, but not usually mentioned), so everyone directly inherits the mother's mitochondrial DNA. DNA sometimes mutates, and if it is harmless, it will remain and continue to be passed down from generation to generation. Therefore, according to the difference between different human mitochondrial DNAs, the order of mutations can be judged; accordingly, different ""haplogroups"" and finer ""haplotypes"" can be defined to facilitate the description of each other's relationship. . Homo sapiens, according to a certain number of specific DNA positions on the mitochondria, can be known that the first two groups are divided, one group is the L0 focused on this study, and the others are classified as L1 to L6. By analogy, people classified as L0 have different order of change, which can be divided into L0d, L0k, L0f, etc., and then continue to subdivide.
Every sapiens is roughly the same, but when researching and describing a particular topic, look for some different features and classify the different groups. ""Genetic concept"" means that human differences are defined by DNA, such as the use of mitochondrial DNA, this person is L0, that person is L3... ""type concept"" is different people In the case of human body materials such as bones and teeth, the differences in type are grouped. Both mitochondrial DNAs are L0 people, and the patterns are not necessarily the same; vice versa.
