Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on November 6 that it was commercially viable to convert stubble into compressed natural gas (CNG) using technology, a move which will provide jobs and additional income to farmers besides reducing air pollution.
After a meeting with some experts on the matter, the chief minister said the move would require all governments to come together and work jointly.
Last week, a public health emergency had been declared in Delhi-NCR following an alarming level of pollution which the AAP government said was because of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana.
