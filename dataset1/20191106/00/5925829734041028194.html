      </p>
      <p>Titan Company’s (Titan) Q2FY2020 performance was impacted by a sharp increase in gold prices, resulting in subdued demand for the jewellery segment; Consolidated revenue grew by just 2.0% and adjusted PAT declined by 2.7% y-o-y during the quarter. Revenue of the jewellery business declined by ~2%; revenue of the watches business grew by 6% and eyewear revenue witnessed ~28% growth during the quarter. Management has cut its guidance of 12-13% growth in the jewellery business in H2FY2020 (earlier 20%); better demand from the marriage segment (22% of jewellery business) would help double-digit growth.</p>

        <b>Outlook</b>
