川普該不該被罷免，你所收到的資訊是正確的嗎？
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by TIME
文：P. W. Singer（美國智庫「新美國」〔New America〕的策略師，也是2019年10月8日平裝出版的《讚爭：被武器化的社群媒體》〔LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media〕的共同作者）譯：彭于庭
一位白宮人士爆料，川普（Donald Trump）曾對某國表示，若他們需要美軍的幫助，那他們也必須幫美國「一個小忙」。該事件不只開啟了川普的彈劾之爭，還有在你螢幕上開打的資訊戰，而後者可能會決定彈劾結果。
從上個時代以來，各國、各軍隊、各企業、各政黨都理解到，也開始著手處理資訊被駭的風險，這又稱為「資訊戰」。
「竊取」資料並非資訊戰可怕的唯一原因，「散布」資訊可能才是真正危險的因素。舉個例子，雖然大家都知道美國民主黨全國委員會（Democratic National Committee，DNC）在2016年選舉期間曾被駭客入侵，但是更嚴重的是，超過半數美國人的臉書個資遭外洩，成為該次「通俄門」事件的一顆棋子。一份10月初公布，由兩黨背書的參議院報告指出，俄羅斯的網路魔人還特別為此事件的成功開香檳慶祝。如果資訊戰是指入侵他人的網路，那麼「讚爭」就是入侵他人的腦袋，透過按讚、分享、或有時說點謊，讓訊息瘋傳出去。
光是2016年，我們就可以在一場彈劾事件中看到所有「讚爭」的因素。總統支持者出資動員群眾，在網路上展開地毯式的搜索要找出這名吹哨人。如果這名吹哨人真被找到了，他人生中任何事情都會當成攻擊的目標，不是說用某種信仰價值去攻擊他，或把他好幾年前的醜事再拿出來羞辱而已，他和他家人的安全可能都會受到威脅。的確，網路上最大的聲浪把吹哨人和支持罷免的人講得好像他們犯了什麼致死的罪，這起網路聲討事件幾乎變成一起暴力事件。記得之前大規模殺人事件的兇手就曾說過跟川普很類似的話，這起事件就介於暴力與「多媒體恐怖主義」之間，而每個人都是造成這起事件的元凶。
相反的，反對總統的人也在網路上展開公開來源情報的搜索行動，這是連十年前的CIA的不一定可以取得的資訊。反川普的行動人士瘋狂搜索各種資料，從五角大廈飛彈延期發射的舊資料，到烏克蘭寡頭政治家的旅行紀錄都不放過，他們的目標就是找出朱利安尼（Rudy Giuliani）和庫許納（Jared Kushner）的交集。
在支持與反對川普人士的搜索行動夾殺之下，也許真相會浮出檯面，但是在通俄門資訊戰背後，民眾對此的反應則是——決定把真相藏在謊言的大海之下。打贏資訊戰需要的不是資訊的一致性，而是應對不斷變更的解釋和「另類事實」。川普偷打了什麼電話？內容是什麼？到底朱利安尼有沒有當總統的個人律師？這些事情好像每天都有不一樣的說法，但這不是哪裡出錯了，這是資訊戰的特徵。
也許資訊戰最先是由俄羅斯開始的（在2014年烏克蘭境內墜機事件後，俄羅斯給出了十幾種互相矛盾的說法），但是資訊戰在政治世界裡已變成一種常態，從彈劾事件（總統和他的幕療說有，也說沒有跟烏克蘭交換條件，而總統的幕僚長麥克・馬瓦尼〔Mick Mulvaney〕的兩面說法中間只隔幾小時）到敘利亞撤兵（總統至少講了6種說法解釋他為什麼同意，或反對土耳其進攻敘利亞，以及為什麼留下盟友庫德族而撤兵）。簡單來說，如果你把水弄得夠混濁，那觀眾也會看得一頭霧水、眼花撩亂，最後就相信你的說法了，或者讓觀眾以為「對方也一樣是錯的。」

在這些資訊瘋傳的戰爭中，你所熟悉的策略和工具都用上了。網友把吹哨人的話加上銀幕大角頭（Anchorman）的梗被製作成許多gif動畫文檔，藉著梗圖的網路文化快速散播。另一方面，反對者反攻的方式則是搬出一套陰謀論，例如他們認為喬治・索羅斯（George Soros）和全球主義者（也就是猶太人）有涉入此事件。兩方也開始了一連串hashtag的戰爭，為的是讓民眾向兩邊靠攏。如果沒有像 #watergate相當的hashtag，民眾就不可能達成一致的意見。
當然這樣的你攻我防可以被笑看成網路上的遊戲，不過它仍帶來不可忽視的影響。形塑社群媒體的因素也會決定觀眾看到的內容，接著觀眾再把資訊分享給親朋好友，同溫層逐漸增厚。除此之外，因為超過90％的記者也使用社群媒體上的資訊，其他的媒體也會被影響。儘管網路瘋傳的情形是刻意製造出來的，它的影響仍然很重大，因為它會決定報社記者播報的內容，也會影響廣播節目製作者想傳達的資訊。
我們不斷看到這些操弄在網路上造成不同的影響，而人民的想法最後決定了選舉的勝負（舉巴西和英國脫歐兩個例子），甚至影響立法機構的投票結果。大概就在一年前的這時候，美國大法院大法官布雷特・卡瓦諾（Brett Kavanaugh）的聽證會就是個被操作的例子。當時凱瑞斯汀・布萊西・福特女士（Christine Blasey Ford）指控卡瓦諾性侵害，但在網路上卻傳出一則對卡瓦諾有利的陰謀論，內容指出當時加害者並非卡瓦諾，而是很像卡瓦諾的人。當時大家對此說法一笑置之，提出者陰謀論的人還因為太丟臉而辭掉華盛頓政府智囊團的工作。但是該說法仍傳開來了，因此溫和派的共和黨議員有理由支持卡瓦諾任命為大法官，也不需要指稱福特女士在說謊。
同樣的情節也發生在撲朔迷離的彈劾案中。曾有錯誤消息指出「深層政府」（Deep State）偷偷修改美國吹哨人相關法律。雖然曾多次闢謠，但是此說法還是廣傳出去，尤其總統和共和黨眾議院領袖凱文・麥卡錫（Kevin McCarthy）都提到過，宣傳效果更大了。
接下來將是影響美國民主的重要時刻。隨著彈劾戰的發展，我們更要擦亮眼睛，不能被瞄準每一個人的資訊戰給誤導。不管是民眾或媒體都需要了解資訊戰的特色，並有能力分辨哪些訊息未經過加油添醋、哪些訊息已經被扭曲為要操弄民眾或電腦。更重要的是，我們要了解自己的力量和責任。民主最重要的就是讓民眾自己判斷哪些事情是真的，哪些事情是被操弄的。

Trump should not be dismissed. Is the information you received correct?
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by TIME
Text: PW Singer (strategist of the US think tank ""New America"", also published on October 8, 2019 in paperback ""LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media"" Co-author) translation: Peng Yuting
A White House official broke the news that Donald Trump had told a country that if they needed the help of the US military, they would also have to help the United States ""a little busy."" The incident not only opened up Trump's impeachment battle, but also an information war on your screen, and the latter may decide to impeach the result.
Since the last era, countries, military, enterprises, and political parties have understood that they are also beginning to deal with the risk of information being shackled. This is also known as the ""information war.""
""Stealing"" information is not the only cause of terrible information warfare. ""Distributing"" information may be a real danger factor. For example, although everyone knows that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was invaded by hackers during the 2016 elections, what is more serious is that more than half of Americans’ Facebook accounts have been leaked. Became a pawn of the ""Russian Gate"" incident. A report released in early October, the bipartisan report of the Senate, pointed out that the Russian Internet Devils also celebrated the success of this event. If information warfare refers to the network that invades others, then ""praise"" is to invade the head of others, let the message go out by praising, sharing, or sometimes telling lies.
Just in 2016, we can see all the factors of ""praising"" in an impeachment incident. The supporters of the president funded the masses and conducted a carpet search on the Internet to find the whistle. If this whistle-blower is really found, anything in his life will be the target of the attack, not to attack him with a certain belief value, or to humiliate him again a few years ago, he and him Family safety may be threatened. Indeed, the biggest voice on the Internet tells the whistle-blower and the people who support the recall as if they had committed a crime of death. This cyber-consultation incident has almost become a violent incident. I remember that the murderer of the mass killing incident once said that it is very similar to Trump. This incident is between violence and ""multimedia terrorism"", and everyone is the culprit in this incident.
Conversely, those who oppose the president are also launching a search for open source intelligence on the Internet, a piece of information that the CIA could not necessarily obtain even a decade ago. Anti-Chuanpu’s activists madly searched for all kinds of information, from the old materials of the Pentagon’s missiles to the delayed launch, to the Ukrainian oligarchy’s travel record. Their goal was to find Rudy Giuliani and Kusch. The intersection of Jared Kushner.
Under the support of the search and opposition to the search activities of Trump, perhaps the truth will come to the forefront, but behind the information warfare in Tongmen, the reaction of the public is to decide to hide the truth under the sea of lies. . What is needed to win the information warfare is not the consistency of information, but the explanation and ""alternative facts"" that are constantly changing. What phone did Trump steal? What is the content? Does Giuliani have a personal lawyer who is the president? These things seem to have different opinions every day, but this is not a mistake. This is the characteristic of information warfare.
Perhaps the information war was first started in Russia (after Russia’s crash in Ukraine in 2014, Russia gave more than a dozen contradictory statements), but information warfare has become a norm in the political world, from impeachment events (president He said that he did not exchange conditions with Ukraine, and that the president’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney’s two-faced statement, only took a few hours to withdraw troops from Syria (the president said at least six statements). Explain why he agreed, or against Turkey’s attack on Syria, and why he left the ally Kurdish and withdrew.) To put it simply, if you make the water turbid, the audience will be confused and dazzled, and finally believe in your statement, or let the audience think that ""the other party is also wrong.""

In the war of these information madness, the strategies and tools you are familiar with are used. The netizens added the words of the whistle-speaker to the stalk of the Anchorman to be made into many gif animation documents, which were quickly spread by the online culture of the stalker. On the other hand, the way in which opponents counterattack is to move out a conspiracy theory, for example, they think that George Soros and globalists (that is, Jews) are involved in this incident. The two sides also began a series of hashtag wars, in order to let the people move closer to the two sides. Without a hashtag like #watergate, it is impossible for the public to reach a consensus.
Of course, you can be laughed at as a game on the Internet, but it still has a negligible impact. The factors shaping the social media will also determine what the audience sees, and then the audience will share the information with friends and family, and the stratosphere will gradually thicken. In addition, because more than 90% of journalists also use information on social media, other media will be affected. Although the situation of online madness is deliberately created, its impact is still significant because it will determine what the newspaper reporters will broadcast and will also affect the information that broadcast producers want to convey.
We continue to see these manipulations have different effects on the Internet, and the people's ideas finally determine the outcome of the election (both examples of Brazil and the Brexit) and even affect the voting results of the legislature. Probably at this time a year ago, the hearing of the US Grand Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was an example of being manipulated. At the time, Christine Blasey Ford accused Cavana of sexual assault, but on the Internet there was a conspiracy theory that was favorable to Cavana, indicating that the injurer was not Kavano. But it is very similar to Cavano. At that time, everyone laughed at this statement. The person who proposed the conspiracy theory also quit the work of the Washington government think tank because it was too shameful. But the argument is still coming, so moderate Republican lawmakers have reason to support the appointment of Cavano as a justice, and there is no need to claim that Ms. Ford is lying.
The same plot also occurred in the confusing impeachment case. There have been mistakes in the ""Deep State"" secretly modifying the laws of the United States. Although it has been rumored many times, this statement is still widely spread, especially the president and Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy have mentioned that the propaganda effect is even greater.
Next will be an important moment influencing American democracy. With the development of the impeachment war, we must polish our eyes and be misled by the information wars aimed at everyone. Whether the public or the media need to understand the characteristics of information warfare, and have the ability to distinguish which messages have not been squandered, and which messages have been distorted to manipulate the people or computers. More importantly, we need to understand our strengths and responsibilities. The most important thing about democracy is to let the people themselves judge what is true and what is being manipulated.
