      <p>RED RIVER, N.M. (AP) - A 60-foot (18-meter) blue spruce was cut down Wednesday during a ceremony in a forested canyon in northern New Mexico, starting a 2½ -week journey that will take it to the U.S. Capitol to be this year’s Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>A sawyer used a chain saw to sever the trunk, which one of two cranes then jerked several feet up in the air. Then both cranes swung the tree over to a flatbed trailer at the Carson National Forest site.</p>
      <p>The tree will tour New Mexico before leaving on a trip scheduled to conclude Nov. 24 at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington.</p>
      <p>According to the project website , stops are scheduled in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia.</p>
