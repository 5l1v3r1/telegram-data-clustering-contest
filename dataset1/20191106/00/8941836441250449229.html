      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> says it will spend the next year verifying all 7 million of its listings as it works to improve user trust.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based home-sharing company says starting next month, it will also rebook guests or refund their money if they check into a property that doesn’t match what was shown online.</p>
      <p>The moves come after a rough week for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb/">Airbnb</a>.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday, a Vice News story revealed a scam by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> hosts who put guests up at inferior properties after claiming the first ones weren’t available.</p>
      <p>That same day, a shooting at an unauthorized Halloween party at an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> rental in Orinda, California, left five people dead.</p>
