""There is a strong positive correlation between steel usage and a nation's economic growth. As India embarks on its next trajectory of growth fuelled by the government's focus on building infrastructure for future, creating smart cities, industrial corridors and so forth, the steel consumption in the country is set for a quantum jump,"" the steel minister said.
India, he said, is on a steady path to becoming a five trillion dollar economy, with emphasis on ease of doing business as well as ease of living.

""Our government has been making concerted efforts...to make India an attractive investment destination for businesses by providing investment-friendly governance. Political stability, predictable policies and a huge diverse market make India an attractive investment destination for global investors.""
