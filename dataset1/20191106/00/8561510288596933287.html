      <h1>Self-Driving Uber That Killed Woman Didn’t Know Jaywalkers Exist</h1>

      <h3>Unprepared Uber</h3>
      <p>In March 2018, a self-driving Uber vehicle in Tempe, Arizona, <a href="https://futurism.com/ubers-self-driving-car-just-killed-pedestrian">struck and killed a woman named Elaine Herzberg</a> as she walked her bicycle across a street outside of a designated crosswalk.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board released hundreds of pages of documents related to its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/self-driving-uber-in-crash-wasn-t-programmed-to-spot-jaywalkers">investigation into the crash</a> — and according to those documents, the Uber’s software didn’t even know people <i>could</i> exist outside of crosswalks, let alone what it should if it encountered a jaywalker.</p>
      <h3>Wasting Time</h3>
      <p>The self-driving Uber noticed Herzberg about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ubers-self-driving-car-didnt-know-pedestrians-could-jaywalk/">5.6 seconds</a> before impact, according to the NTSB’s investigation.</p>
      <p>But because it didn’t expect to see a person in the middle of the road outside of crosswalks, it first classified her as “vehicle.” It then changed that classification several times before finally settling on “bicycle” — and realizing that a collision was imminent — just 1.2 seconds before impact.</p>
      <h3>One Second</h3>
      <p>At that point, the vehicle could’ve slammed on its brakes — but it didn’t do that until just .2 seconds before impact.</p>
      <p>According to the NTSB, that was due to a built-in one-second delay between when the car detects a potential crash and when it does something to avoid it.</p>
      <p>The goal of the delay is to avoid <a href="https://futurism.com/ubers-self-driving-car-decided-swerve">false positives</a>, but in the case of Herzberg, that extra second might have been enough time for the self-driving Uber — or the safety driver behind its wheel — to take action to prevent her death.</p>
