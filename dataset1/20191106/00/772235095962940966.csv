2020 Lexus LC Convertible Prototype: Walkaround tour
06 Nov 2019 by Mandy Turner



November 3, 2019: For the first time in Australia, the Lexus LC Convertible prototype is on show to the public at the 2019 Lexus Melbourne Cup.
It appears nothing has changed since its world debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July, still covered in what Lexus call ‘digital camouflage’.
As there are no blue hybrid badges, the prototype is powered by the same V8 petrol engine as found in the LC500 coupe this car is based off. Lexus Australia is still yet to confirm if the LC Convertible will be added to its local range.
