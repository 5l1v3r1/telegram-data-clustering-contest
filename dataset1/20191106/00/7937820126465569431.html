      <p>I’ve been a scientific glassblower for 33 years. For much of that, I’ve worked at the University of Oxford, where I design and create glass equipment that scientists can use for their research.</p>
      <p>The piece I’m most proud of is a perfusion apparatus that is used to keep human organs functioning outside the body. But I also make glassware that is used throughout the university, such as high-vacuum manifolds, which are a series of knobs that operate a vacuum; glass apparatus for -distillation and sublimation experiments; vessels with water jackets used to heat and cool materials; and high-temperature furnace tubes made of quartz or ceramic.</p>
      <p>My workbench hosts an array of tools for working with glass, many of which were custom-made for specific jobs. Each tool reminds me of what I first used it for and makes me consider how I might use it again.</p>
      <p>Most are made of carbon, and need to be highly polished before use because any irregularities will be transferred to the finish on the glass.</p>
      <p>My workbench is also where I ponder the design of new glassware. It’s quite easy to sketch something on a piece of paper, but reproducing that concept as a workable piece of glass -equipment is a much more difficult endeavour.</p>
      <p>I find that a lot of my work relies on intuition: I instinctively know when the glass is the right temperature, or at what speed it needs to rotate on the lathe. Usually, I can tell when it’s turning fast enough by the sound of the lathe.</p>
      <p>Glassblowing is a declining art — worldwide, there aren’t many schools that teach it any more. A lot of the work can be done by a computer, and there are now alternative materials to non-magnetic glassware.</p>
      <p>However, I learn something new almost every week, and am inspired by knowing that a little piece of glassware that I’ve made has contributed in some way to the bigger picture of science when a researcher achieves milestone results.</p>
