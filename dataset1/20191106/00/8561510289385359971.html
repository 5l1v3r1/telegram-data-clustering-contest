      <h1>New AI Can Make a Vid of You Dancing Like a Pro From a Single Pic</h1>

      <h3>Break It Down</h3>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">Do you have two left feet, but wish that, just once, you could bust some moves — or at least look like you can?</span>
      </p>
      <p>Good news: There’s now an AI for that, and it needs just one full body photo to make you look like the next Beyoncé.</p>
      <h3>Multipurpose AI</h3>
      <p>The AI is the work of NVIDIA’s research team. They recently published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12713">paper</a> on the tech on the pre-print server <i>arXiv,</i> and they’ve pledged to <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid/issues/1">release the code</a> as soon as lawyers “resolve some legal issues.”</p>
      <p>In addition to working on people, the AI can make sculptures look like they’re dancing their asses off, too. It can also be applied to just faces, making a person look like they’re saying something they didn’t. And if that wasn’t enough, it can also take an image of any city and output a video of a car seemingly driving down its streets.</p>

      <h3>Step Up</h3>
      <p>This isn’t the first AI designed to create videos in which a person appears to do something they <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/deepfake-barack-obama-black-panther">didn’t</a> — <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/new-deepfake-app-zao">or can’t</a> — do. But two things set it apart from most others.</p>
      <p>First, it doesn’t need a slew of  images or videos of a target to work. Second, other AIs can typically only output videos of a target included in their training set — this one will work with an image of anyone.</p>
      <p>The clips might not be perfect, but they should give you an idea of how close we’re coming to being able to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/system-easy-create-deepfakes">easily create</a> flawless deepfakes — and how desperately we need <a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-detecting-deepfakes">tech to detect them</a>.</p>
