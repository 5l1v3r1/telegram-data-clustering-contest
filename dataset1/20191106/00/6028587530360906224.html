      <p>Not so fast, Arnault!Bill Gates is back to being the second richest person in the world Wednesday, a day after ceding the spot to luxury goods kingpin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/bernard-arnault/">Bernard Arnault</a>. Arnault was No. 2 richest for just one day; his net worth fell <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cartercoudriet/2019/11/05/bernard-arnault-second-richest-lvmh-bezos-gates/#64e7c9c57b2a">from $107 billion Tuesday</a> to $106 billion as of 4:30 pm ET Wednesday.  Gates ended the day Wednesday at $106.8 billion, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#28cfd3f93d78">Forbes’ Real Time Billionaire rankings</a>.</p>
      <p>Because the two men’s net worths differ by just $800 million, it’s possible they could switch places again. And again.</p>
      <p>Gates, Arnault and Jeff Bezos (who’s ranked No. 1) are the only three centi-billionaires in <i>Forbes</i>’ ranking of the world’s richest people. Arnault’s net worth has skyrocketed since he clocked in at $76 billion on<i> Forbes</i>’<a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#4ab44245251c"> 2019 World’s Billionaires list</a>, published in March. Since then, the stock of his Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, whose holdings include Louis Vuitton and Sephora, has risen by more than 33%. In late October, the stock surged <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2019/10/28/billionaire-bernard-arnaults-lvmh-group-confirms-discussions-with-tiffany-over-145-billion-takeover-bid/#13ca38595b92">following news</a> that LVMH was exploring the purchase of U.S. jewelry firm Tiffany.</p>
      <p>Arnault’s net worth fell by $1 billion on Wednesday as shares of LVMH dropped 0.17% on the <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/products/equities/list#">Euronext Paris exchange</a>. About 90% of Arnault’s fortune lies in LVMH stock he and his family hold.  Gates, meanwhile, has sold or given away much of his Microsoft stake; he only owns around 1% of the $1.1 trillion (market cap) software company he cofounded with Paul Allen. It’s a dynamic that Arnault recently called attention to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2019/10/31/the-100-billion-man-how-bernard-arnault-stitched-together-the-worlds-third-biggest-fortune-with-louis-vuitton-dior-and-77-other-brandsand-why-hes-not-done-yet/#1df4c53e4efb">while speaking with <i>Forbes</i></a>; while noting that Microsoft is “a beautiful company,” he highlighted how few shares Gates retains, saying, “Long-term, he won’t be there.”</p>
      <p>Though Microsoft stock fell a tiny bit Wednesday—just 0.28%—some of Gates’ other investments, including  Berkshire Hathaway and waste manager Republic Services, ended the day higher, offsetting much of Microsoft’s minute losses. That made the difference in this neck-and-neck measurement of billions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/">Gates</a> crossed over the $100 billion mark <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2019/04/18/bill-gates-net-worth-eclipses-100-billion-again/#1ca96a3a480e">back in April,</a> following a positive quarterly earnings report for Microsoft. He also briefly eclipsed 12 digits in 1999 amid the dot-com bubble. He held onto the No. 1 spot on Forbes’ annual list of the World’s Billionaires for almost two decades; Amazon chief Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2019/03/04/this-is-the-richest-person-in-the-world/#75f17c4136db">took the title</a> in 2018 and has held onto it, other than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2019/10/24/jeff-bezos-is-no-longer-the-richest-person-in-the-world/#54367fd67ae8">a brief dip behind Gates in October</a>. Arnault, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2019/10/31/the-100-billion-man-how-bernard-arnault-stitched-together-the-worlds-third-biggest-fortune-with-louis-vuitton-dior-and-77-other-brandsand-why-hes-not-done-yet/">who was recently profiled in a <i>Forbes</i> cover story</a>, is the only other person whose fortune comes close to Bezos’s $111.9 billion net worth. Investor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/#703705a24639">Warren Buffett</a> ranks fourth with an $87.5 billion fortune. </p>
