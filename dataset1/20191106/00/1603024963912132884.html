      <p>Like video and music streaming platforms, online gaming players are also looking at Tier II and III cities as the growth area.</p>
      <p>Take the example of WinZO Games, that has on its platform a user base of over 10 million – of which, less than 10 percent are from metros cities, according to data shared by the company.</p>
      <p>Top markets for WinZO include the Hindi-speaking belt i.e. Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi followed by Gujarat and Maharashtra.</p>

      <p>WinZO believes that transactions of very small amounts, or micro-transactions, are the way forward for Tier II and III markets. It offers micro-transactions of as low as Rs 2 to play games on its platform.</p>
      <p>This is because people from smaller towns are still evolving in terms of spending digitally. Micro-transactions establish confidence among users to spend on online entertainment platforms.</p>
      <p>According to WinZO, UPI and digital payments are encouraging people to pay on online platforms. The company so far has seen 130 million micro-transactions every month, of which more than 90 percent were done via UPI/wallet modes.</p>
      <p>On WinZo, 30 percent of consumers from Tier II and III cities are making their first media and entertainment transaction online. On an average, a user makes 25-30 micro transactions per month on the platform and the average time spent on the app is 45 mins per day.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t be wrong to say that micro transactions are the way forward while dealing with users from the Tier II or III markets and WinZO is certain of that.</p>
      <p>“The idea is to allow the users to experience a localized product with minimum transaction. Once the user is comfortable, we have seen a lot of bigger transactions from paying users. If we truly want to reach out to ‘Bharat’, then micro-transaction is the way forward,” said WinZO.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
