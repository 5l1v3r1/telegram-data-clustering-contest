      <p>Today, Chris Brown had a yard sale. It’s an activity many of us are familiar with. Centered around the clearing of closets, age-old storage units, or, in his case, an 8,300-square-foot Tarzana estate, and dumping any unwanted possessions outside for a handful of neighbors to peruse, a conventional yard sale is at once exciting and unimpressive.</p>
      <p>Chris Brown’s goes beyond that.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the singer announced to his 89 million followers that he would be selling “significantly marked-down, high end designer items” at his gated home in Tarzana, listing the address and hours (10 a.m. to 7 p.m. today, Wednesday November 6, though his <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisbrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a> implies it’s a two-day affair).</p>
      <p>The online announcement—featuring a purple illustration of Brown wearing a baseball cap and hoodie with his head in the clouds (and feet, to be fair)—received over 150,000 likes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4eQrhmBPZQ/">Instagram</a> and was simply captioned “DA CRIB...❤️ ”.</p>
      <p>The singer is controversial—he was arrested in 2009 after physically abusing then-girlfriend Rihanna—and the property is notable for its own history with the law: shortly after he bought it in 2015, the house was subject to a break-in that resulted in Brown’s aunt getting locked in a closet, according to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-chris-brown-20150727-story.html">LA Times</a>, and just last year, officer’s reportedly seized an illegal pet money from the home.</p>
      <p>Regardless, fans started lining up Tuesday night for a chance to buy luxury at yard sale prices, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWajngLnPoc">aerial footage</a> shows at least 12 tents, each with multiple racks of clothing and accessories, dotting a parking lot on the property with a graffitied bus behind.</p>
      <p>Shoppers told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/06/chris-brown-yard-sale-house-lapd-cops-shut-down-attempt/">TMZ</a> that they were being let in 10 at a time, with people spending around $500 for merchandise they believed could be worth thousands. Proceeds will go to a yet-unspecified charity.</p>
