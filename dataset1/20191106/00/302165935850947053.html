      <p>This is not the first time that Coxon contributes to the soundtrack of the <i>The End of the F**king World</i>, as he also composed the score for the show's critically-acclaimed first season.</p>
      <p>Last year, the musician opened up about his involvement in the hit series based on Charles Forsman's graphic novel of the same name.</p>
      <p>“Matt Biffa, who is a music supervisor, contacted me about the show and Jonathan [Entwistle], who co-directed, wanted me to do it. We met and talked about it, and I read the scripts and I sort of bought myself a copy of the comic book. Scripts are interesting to read, they're not like novels,” he told NME, also adding that he wrote “tons of stuff” for the project.</p>
      <p><i>The End of the F**king World</i> follows James and Alyssa, respectively portrayed by Alex Lawther and Jessica Barden, as they embark on a chaotic road trip to escape their boring lives.</p>
      <p>While details about the plot of the second season are still scarce, the series will see the introduction of the new characters of Bonnie (played by Naomi Ackie) and Tim Key.</p>
