【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】什麽叫藝術？不同的理解就會產生不同的藝術實踐和品評。簡單比喻：蛆蠅在糞土中竄索玩味無窮；龜兔僅在平地上比快慢；雄鷹以搏擊長空為快；蛟龍以蹈海與窮變為能；神佛以眷顧蒼生萬物而樂此不疲。
隨著宇宙成住壞滅的大規律，神留給人類的傳統道德在藝術創作中幾乎喪失殆盡。藝術是人類社會的風向標和溫度計，隨著人類道德的低下，藝術也隨其變異，敗落再敗落，直至目前的藝術界成為一片荒野、垃圾遍地，僅存的也只不過那點有限的技巧而已。當然技巧是非常非常重要的，沒有技巧，無從談藝術。但通觀目前全世界所有的美術大賽，查遍當今所有的所謂美術精品畫冊，哪有幾件內涵深刻、形式完美、稱得起是嚴肅神聖的真正創作呢？
從大紀元發表的《魔鬼在統治著我們的世界》一書，大家可以看到是多麽令人驚心動魄——魔鬼掏空了人們的正念、變異了人類的審美趣味、抑制了藝術家的智慧與靈性！現代意識的狂潮惡沙埋沒了藝海中那些真正有善念、有才華和有理想的藝術家，現代人類藝術的敗懷，已遠遠超過任何一個人類文明因敗壞而被銷毀的時期；否極泰來，就在這人類文明即將被毀滅的危險時刻，無量慈悲和萬能的創世主早已來到人間傳法。他在正整個宇宙法的同時，更眷顧著人間美術這一塊的有緣人，他讓新唐人電視台這個面向全世界的媒體，以全世界人物寫實油畫大賽的形式，將美術界真正的菁英找出來；一方面是利用這個國際平台展示畫家的才華；另一方面又通過大家的共同努力，搭起一個復興人類真正藝術並創造嶄新輝煌、使藝術走上一條永生不滅昌盛繁榮之路的橋樑。在這個藝風日下的時代，能夠認同本大賽的理念報名參賽者，已經很難得了；能入圍得獎就更加了不起。別小看這一行為，因為宇宙在正法，大穹在重組，人類在歸正，一般人還看不到這個不可逆轉的大趨勢，你們卻已走在了最前列，你們的名字將永遠銘刻在人類文明的藝術史上。
在這次第五屆大賽中，有來自46個國家的258位畫家提交402件作品，其中88位畫家的104件作品入圍。
我代表評委會在感謝新唐人為舉辦本次大賽所作努力的同時，也為在座的和所有參賽的畫家感到高興並致以祝賀！當然在某種程度上也有些遺憾，就是有些技法很好畫派也正的畫家，由於對本大賽的要求尚不夠明確，這次沒能拿到大獎；不過值得欣慰的是：他們和大家一樣，已經知道什麼是人應有的藝術，走在了藝術回歸正路的大道上，也將會有輝煌的成就。因為我們和創世主同在， 將是人類真正藝術的主力軍，引領整個人類的藝術沿著正路發展與前進。
創世主告誡我們：「神傳給人藝術的目地是為了能使人表達人類所崇尚的善與美」，又說：「在你們的作品中也要表現美好、表現正、表現純、表現善、表現光明。」 還說：「神在庇護著人類，人要做好就會有善果。」
這裡我要給大家透露一個很高的天機：我們都是帶著崇高的使命從最美好的天國來兌現誓約的；今天能夠走到這裡來的畫家，都是有很大緣份的，有人想來也會因為各種干擾和原因來不了。 再一個天機：人的元神是不滅的，由於在你生生世世的輪迴轉生中封塵太厚，忘掉了自己的記憶，今天我們要沿著藝術創作的正路，越做越好，走回美好的家園。
如前所述，藝術分不同的層次，不同的人格、不同的境界就會對藝術有不同的理解。藝術是一個藝術家內心世界的外現，也就是說，藝術作品表現的就是藝術家本人。那麽要想創作出創世主希望的那樣美好的藝術，是不是得將自己的內心世界變好？因為雞腸小肚是生不出鳳凰來的，只有將自己變成鳳凰才能生出鳳凰。這個改變與洗刷自己的過程，不斷接近宇宙特性不斷開智開慧的昇華過程，是不是不修道已在道中的過程？有詩曰：「慧流是淨洗，大師步天梯。」實際就是不斷去除人間不良觀念、不知不覺回到自己美好天國世界的過程。
藝術是人類社會上升與下滑的潤滑劑和加速器，藝術家是人類靈魂的工程師。而宇宙中有不失不得善惡有報的理，在創作一系列好作品、對人類社會起好作用的同時，是不是就積了大德？德多大，所享受到的榮耀就會有多大，就會成為宇宙中不同層次的生命。即使有的畫家做的不盡完美，也會付出多少得到多少，獲得應有的福份，至少不至於隨著敗壞了的社會風氣墮落，在糊裏糊塗中創作那些無聊的作品危害人類而造業，那對生命的未來可是極其悲慘的啊！這樣看來，在創造人間藝術輝煌的同時，不就是在鋪就生命永遠美好的路？
新唐人電視台舉辦的全世界人物寫實油畫大賽確實起到了互相交流提高的作用。如有一位畫家雖未接受美術學院的教育，但在參加本項大賽的過程中虛心學習，在名家的專業指導之下，不斷提高，潛心創作，連續兩屆獲得金獎；在2014年獲得了本項大賽最高獎項的一位畫家，在中國最權威的中央美術學院附中部學了四年，大學部學了五年，可是他說這九年中在創作上什麽也沒學到，而是在參加本大賽的過程中學會了創作。 還有一位其作品曾在世界各地很多博物館展出、並有多件作品被收藏的現代派畫家，他用寫實技法創作了一幅表達現代變異觀念的作品來參賽，但是沒有獲獎。經過交流，他心悅誠服的改變了觀念，並立起大拇指說：「你們辦這樣大賽的舉動太偉大了！理念太好了！我也要回歸傳統，我下一個展覽的名稱就改為“回歸”。」他特意買了兩本大賽的畫冊，說是要放到他的畫展上，並請我提供建議。我說：「你是真正的藝術家！  」
未來的社會將以什麽樣的標準為藝術和藝術家定位，這是顯而易見，不容置疑的了。
很多藝術家對本大賽有很多讚美的反饋意見，他們非常認同大賽的理念。上屆大賽有一位畫家指著大賽的前言說，他已非常認真的讀過四遍了，還想再讀；有人很有體會的說：新唐人舉辦的全世界人物寫實油畫大賽，就是在黑夜藝海航行中的燈塔，把那些有理想的畫家聚集了起來；也有的人表示是在參加該大賽的過程中，大賽的理念撥亮了他的心燈。
以下以一首小詩與大家在創作上交流。
大藝
技法必精純
大藝須好人
志通天
不做庸匠做美神
修得純正光明慈悲心
思維洪闊高遠深
盡精微至廣大
招無盡
美奇新
醍醐灌頂開胸襟
觀之融醉魂重塑
高邁超絕皆天品
再寫幾句與那些根基特別好，緣份特別大的畫家們共勉。
回家
修正法慧泉洞開
心純美天品神光
灑金光濟世救人
載譽歸天庭聖蒼
惜善緣，有機會聚在一起，就很想把心底裡的話掏給大家，讓我們共同努力，創作出更多更美的傳世精品。
謝謝大家！

Words from Chief Judge
 

Cherishing
   
Predestined Relationships
 

Different understandings of art history lead to different forms of
artistic expression, as well as interpretation and evaluation of what
makes genuine fine art. A simple metaphor to describe this would be: A
fly finds pleasure merely playing in waste; the tortoise and hare can
only race on land while the eagle has free rein in the sky; the dragon
is capable of turning the sea; and the caregiving of all living things
is the eternal gratification of Gods and Buddhas.
 
Following the Universe’s law of creation, stasis, degeneration, and
destruction, the traditional moral values that God left for humanity
have, in the field of artistic creation, as well as in society at large,
been all but lost.  Art has always served as the weather vane and
thermometer of human society. As human morality has declined, art has
mutated along with it.
 
In the march of history, and the steady decline in the chaotic tangle of
human depravity, the undercurrent of human artistic expression has
become what it is.  All that is left from the previous eras of artistic
glory are a few of the original techniques.
 
Without the artistic techniques created and perfected by generations of
masters of the arts, there would be no genuine art to speak of. But
looking at the fine art created today, how many pieces can be found that
are both profound in content and meaning as well as perfect in technique
and form? How many can be regarded as true, sacred artistic creations?
 
In the book, “The Specter of Communism Is Ruling Our World"", published
by The Epoch Times, there is a most frightening reality spelled out. The
book explains how communism and the evil specter driving it have mutated
the aesthetic taste of human beings and suppressed the wisdom and
spirituality of artists, as well as of society at large.
 
Authentic artists are truly good-minded, yet they have been swept up by
the current of modern consciousness and have lost the will to create
true masterpieces with the upright moral inspiration and techniques that
once existed.  The degeneration of art, as well as the moral climate in
general, far exceeds that of any other period of time throughout the
history of human civilization.
 
However, trends, whether material or ethereal, tend to reverse when
reaching the extreme.  In these times when humankind dances with
destruction, Buddhas, Daos, and Gods are ultimately in control and human
life is in their hands. It is they who provide opportunities for mankind
to alter its course and save themselves from destruction.
 
The incomparably compassionate Creator has already come to the world to
spread the law of universe.  While he is rectifying the law of universe, he is
also caring for the predestined people in the field of the arts.
 
In view of that understanding, NTD Television, a global multi language
broadcasting company, has taken the initiative to invite exceptional oil
painters from all over the world to compete in their realistic oil
painting competition.
 
The intent of this competition is to inspire artists to produce works of
exceptional quality in both technique and content. The ultimate outcome
is the creating of a bridge, to a path of return to higher moral values
and eternal prosperity for humankind, expressed through the medium of
oil painting.
 
This competition is an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate your
talent to a wide audience while helping forge the path back to true,
authentic fine art as developed and created by the great Masters of the
past.
 
To identify with the goal of this contest is truly remarkable in this
era of declined morals and degenerate art. To enter your work and be
selected as a finalist is a magnificent achievement for an artist
seeking to perfect their technique and show their work on an
international stage.
 
The NTD international figure competition, and the inspiration behind it,
are a significant contribution in providing humanity with a platform to
regain its upright moral footing, both in the arts and society.
 
NTD is hosting this art competition in order to forge a path back to
truly fine art. NTD is encouraging all the participants to produce works
that are truly inspiring. Not only in technique, but in content that is
in concert with traditional concepts of human life and its relationship
with the divine.
 
By participating in this endeavour, you are part of a groundbreaking
effort to pave a path for humankind to return to the heavenly principles
of truth, compassion, and endurance that have repeatedly triumphed over
the decay of moral values and sustained the course of human history to
this day. Being able to accept this challenge is, in itself, a truly
righteous act.
 
This is the fifth NTD figure painting competition. From 258 contestants
from 46 countries, 402 works of art were entered. Of those, 88
contestants and 104 artistic works made it past the qualifying round.
 
I want to thank NTD Television for hosting the competition and I want
to thank and congratulate the painters who have submitted their work.
I regret that some of you were not selected as finalists in the
competition; the good news is, you have already embarked on the road of
returning art to its righteous path.
 
I look forward to your winnings in the next and future competitions.
 
I firmly believe that you will make brilliant achievements, because you
are committed to creating true fine art. As artists with a passion for
inspiring humanity towards goodness in your works, you will be helping
NTD bring back the true purpose of humanity’s fine art tradition.
 
The Creator has told us: “The reason Gods passed the arts on to human
beings was to enable humans to express the goodness and beauty that
mankind upholds”, as well as “in your artwork you should display what’s
beautiful, what’s upright, what’s pure, what’s good, and what’s bright
and positive.”, and “Gods are protecting mankind, and when human beings
do good things, it will result in good things for them.”
 
Here, I will disclose a great heavenly secret. The painters who are able
to come here today have great predestined relationships. Some people
want to come, but are unable to due to various disturbances and reasons.
We all come from the most beautiful heaven carrying our missions.
Another heavenly secret – a person’s primordial spirit does not perish.
It’s only that in your life’s numerous reincarnations, the dust has been
layered on too thick, and you have forgotten your own memories. Today we
have to follow the righteous path of artistic creation and through
continuing to do good things, return to our old home.
 
Within art there are different levels, different personalities, and
different realms, which compose different understandings of art. Art is
the outward expression of an artist’s inner world.
 
If you want to create a magnificent piece of art, you have to beautify
your inner world. As the saying goes, chicken innards can’t give birth
to a phoenix. Only by becoming a phoenix can you give birth to one. The
process of cleansing oneself is one of constantly assimilating to the
higher characteristics of the universe. It is a continuous process of
wisdom and enlightenment. It is synonymous with being “in the Tao
without cultivating the Tao.""
 
A poem states: “The flow of wisdom is one of purification. The
master climbs the ladder to heaven.”
 
In fact, it is the process of continuously removing the bad
thoughts of human beings, and returning to one’s original
heavenly home. At the same time, there is the law of “no loss, no gain”
and “good is rewarded and evil is punished” in the universe. Some people
say that art is the lubricant and accelerator for the rise and fall of
society. The artist is the engineer of the human soul. When you
create a series of good works and play a good role in human society,
isn’t this a great virtue? One’s virtue is as high as one’s
character. However much virtue you accumulate is how much glory
you will enjoy. Lives in the universe have hierarchies, and you will be
gods at different levels. Even if some painters are not satisfied with
their work, they will gain however much they put in. Their virtue will
be converted into blessings, such as becoming a big official or making a
fortune, in the next life. At the very least, you will not run with the
corrupted social atmosphere by creating tasteless works that endanger
humans and create karma. From this perspective, aren’t you not only
creating a glorious period for human art, but also paving the way for
your life’s eternal happiness?
 
As to what kind of standards the future world will set for art and
for artists, there is already zero doubt. Moreover, the worldwide
realistic oil painting competition held by NTD Television
has indeed played the role of sparking mutual dialogue and improvement.
 
For example, one artist never attended a fine arts academy, but won the
gold prize for two consecutive competitions. Another painter said that he
attended the authoritative Central Academy of Fine Arts in China,
with four years in the auxiliary department and five years in the
university department. However, he didn’t learn anything about artistic
creation, which he learned in the process of participating in this
competition. He won the competition’s highest award in 2014. The
awarding of the competition is fair by principle, because the
exhibitions are held openly, and the competition albums are preserved to
be gauged at any time. As another example, there was an artist whose
works have been exhibited in art museums around the world, and many of
his works have been collected. As he entered our competition as a famous
modern artist using realism techniques to express deviated modern
notions, we didn’t give him an award. After communicating with him, he
changed his mind with great conviction. He said while holding a thumbs
up, “Your motive for holding this competition is so great! The
philosophy is excellent!” He also wanted to return to tradition. The
name of his next solo exhibition was changed to “return"", and he also
bought two albums from the competition which he said he would place in
his exhibition. He asked me to say a few words to him. I said, “You are
a true artist!""
 
Many artists have given a lot of positive feedback. They very much
agree with the philosophy of the competition. In the previous
competition, a painter pointed to the foreword of the competition,
saying that he had already carefully read it four times, but still wants
to read it. Some people with strong experiences said that New Tang
Dynasty’s worldwide realistic oil painting competition is like a
lighthouse, in the sea of the night, gathering artists with similar
ideals; others have said that in the process of participating in the
contest, the light in their hearts brightened.
 
Below are two poems on the topic of artistic creation to share with
everyone.
 
Great Art
Techniques must be refined and pure
Great art needs good people.
A drive reaching heaven
Don’t be an ordinary artisan, be a great god.
 
Cultivate oneself to be pure and upright, optimistic and compassionate
From the minuscule to the vast
Broad thoughts reaching high, far, and deep
Inexhaustible,
Beautiful, wondrous, and new
Anointing the head with the finest cream, the opening of hearts and
aspirations
Once viewed, drunk in harmony, and a soul reconstructed
Exuberant and excelling, all heavenly works
 
Here’s a few more lines to share with those with exceptionally good
inborn quality and predestined relationships.
 
Returning Home
 
Righteous Cultivation, the springs and caves of wisdom opened
A pure and beautiful heart, heavenly works and divine light
Scattering golden light saving the world’s people
Carrying acclaim back to the heavenly celestial paradise
 
Since I cherish our predestined relationship to be with each other, I
wanted to share with everyone words from the bottom of my heart. Let’s
work together to create even more beautiful everlasting fine art!
Thank you all!

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] What is art? Different understandings lead to different artistic practices and evaluations. Simple metaphor: 蛆 在 在 在 粪 粪 粪 粪 ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;
As the universe becomes a big law of destruction, the traditional morality that God has left for humanity is almost lost in artistic creation. Art is the vane and thermometer of human society. With the low morality of human beings, art also mutates with it, and it is degraded and degraded. Until the current art world has become a wilderness and garbage, the only remaining is only a limited skill. . Of course, the skills are very, very important, there is no skill, no way to talk about art. But looking at all the current art competitions in the world, and looking through all the so-called fine art albums of today, how many pieces of profound, perfect form, and can be regarded as serious and sacred real creations?
From the book ""The Devil is Dominating Our World"" published by the Epoch Times, everyone can see how shocking it is - the devil has hollowed out people's righteous thoughts, mutated human aesthetic taste, and suppressed the artist's wisdom and spirituality. ! The frenzy of modern consciousness has buried the artists in the art sea who are truly good-minded, talented and ideal. The defeat of modern human art has far surpassed any period in which human civilization was destroyed due to corruption; At this dangerous moment when human civilization is about to be destroyed, the incomparable compassion and omnipotent Creator has already come to the world to spread the Fa. At the same time as the whole universe law, he is more concerned about the talents of human art. He let the New Tang Dynasty TV station, the media facing the whole world, find out the real elites of the art world in the form of realistic oil painting contests of the world. On the one hand, it is to use this international platform to showcase the talents of the painters; on the other hand, through the joint efforts of all of you, it is a bridge to revitalize the true art of mankind and create new glory, and to make art embark on a road of eternal prosperity and prosperity. In this era of art style, it is already very difficult to sign up for the concept of this contest. It is even more remarkable to be a finalist. Don't underestimate this behavior, because the universe is in Fa-rectification, the rebellion is reorganized, the human being is rectifying, and the general people still can't see this irreversible megatrend. You are already at the forefront, and your name will always be engraved in In the art history of human civilization.
In this fifth competition, 258 painters from 46 countries submitted 402 works, of which 104 were selected by 88 painters.
On behalf of the jury, I am grateful to the New Tang Dynasty for their efforts in organizing this competition. I am also pleased and congratulated the painters present and all the participating artists! Of course, there are some regrets to some extent, that is, some painters with good techniques and good paints. Because the requirements for this competition are not clear enough, this time they did not get the grand prize; but it is gratifying that they are like everyone else. Knowing what is the art that people should have, walking on the road of art returning to the right path, will also have brilliant achievements. Because we are with the Creator, it will be the main force of human true art, leading the art of the entire human race to develop and advance along the right path.
The Creator warned us: ""The purpose of God's art is to enable people to express the good and the beauty that mankind advocates."" He also said: ""In your works, you must also show good, positive, pure, and good. And the performance is bright."" He also said: ""God is sheltering human beings. If people are to do well, they will have good fruits.""
Here I want to tell you a very high chance: we all honor the vows from the most beautiful heaven with a lofty mission; the painters who can come here today have a lot of fate, some people I think it will not come because of various interferences and reasons. Another celestial opportunity: the human god is immortal, because in the life of the world's revolving life, the dust is too thick, forgetting your own memory, today we have to follow the path of artistic creation, the better, the better, walk back to the beautiful Home.
As mentioned above, art is divided into different levels, different personalities and different realms will have different understandings of art. Art is the appearance of an artist's inner world, that is to say, the artist works by the artist himself. So, if you want to create a beautiful art that the Creator hopes, is it necessary to make your inner world better? Because the chicken intestines are born out of the phoenix, only when you turn yourself into a phoenix can you give birth to a phoenix. This change and the process of scrubbing oneself, constantly approaching the characteristics of the universe, does not break the sublimation process of Zhikaihui. Is it not the process of repairing the Tao already in the Tao? There are poems: ""The Huiliu is a cleansing, and the master steps the ladder."" The reality is the process of constantly removing the bad ideas of the human world and unconsciously returning to the world of a beautiful heaven.
Art is the lubricant and accelerator for the rise and fall of human society, and the artist is the engineer of the human soul. In the universe, there is no loss of good and evil, and when we create a series of good works and play a good role in human society, is it a great virtue? Deduo, how much glory will be enjoyed, will become different levels of life in the universe. Even if some painters do not perfect, they will pay much and get the blessings they deserve, at least not with the corrupted social atmosphere, creating boring works in the past to endanger humans. Industry, the future of life is extremely tragic! In this way, while creating the brilliance of human art, isn’t it just paving the way for life to be forever beautiful?
The World People's Realistic Oil Painting Contest held by NTDTV has indeed played a role in mutual communication and improvement. If a painter has not received the education of the Academy of Fine Arts, but he is humbly learning in the process of participating in this competition, under the professional guidance of famous artists, constantly improve and concentrate on creation, winning gold medals for two consecutive sessions; obtained this in 2014. A painter of the highest award in the contest, studied in the middle school of the most authoritative Central Academy of Fine Arts in China for four years, and studied in the university for five years, but he said that he did not learn anything in his creation during the past nine years. I learned to create in the process of participating in this competition. There is also a modernist painter whose works have been exhibited in many museums around the world and have many works collected. He used his realistic techniques to create a work that expresses the concept of modern variation, but he did not win the prize. After the exchange, he changed his mind with conviction and raised his thumb and said: ""The move you have in this competition is too great! The idea is so good! I will return to the tradition. The name of my next exhibition will be changed to ""return"". He specially bought two albums of the contest, saying that he wanted to put it on his exhibition and asked for advice. I said, ""You are a real artist!""
It is obvious and unquestionable what kind of standards the future society will position for art and artists.
Many artists have a lot of praise for this contest, they very much agree with the concept of the contest. In the previous contest, a painter pointed to the preface of the contest. He has read it very carefully four times and wants to read it again. Some people have a good experience: the New Tang Dynasty’s world-famous realistic oil painting contest is in the dark night art. The lighthouse in the sea voyage gathered the ideal painters; others said that during the competition, the concept of the competition illumined his heart.
Here is a small poem to communicate with everyone in the creation.
Da Yi
Skills must be pure
Da Yi must be a good person
Zhitongtian
Don't be a meek to be a god
Pure and compassionate
Thinking broad and deep
As fine as the majority
Endless
Mickey
醍醐 顶 top open chest
Reconstruction
Gaomai is absolutely superb
Write a few more words to the painters who are particularly good at the roots and who have a very high margin.
Come back home
Amend the law Huiquan hole to open
Heart pure beauty
Sprinkle gold and save the world
Reputed to heavenly heavenly
If you have a chance to get together, you will want to bring the words in your heart to everyone, let us work together to create more beautiful and beautiful products.
thank you all!

I look forward to your winnings in the next and future competitions.

I sure believe that you will make brilliant achievements, because you
Are committed to creating true fine art. As artists with a passion for
Inspiring humanity towards goodness in your works, you will be helping
NTD bring back the true purpose of humanity’s fine art tradition.

The Creator has told us: ""The reason Gods passed the arts on to human
Beings to to enable humans to express the goodness and beauty that
Mankind upholds”, as well as “in your artwork you should display what’s
Beautiful, what’s upright, what’s pure, what’s good, and what’s bright
And positive."", and ""Gods are protecting mankind, and when human beings
Do good things, it will result in good things for them.""

Here, I will disclose a great heavenly secret. The painters who are able
To come here today have great predestined relationships. Some people
Want to come, but are unable to due to various disturbances and reasons.
We all come from the most beautiful heaven carrying our missions.
Another heavenly secret – a person’s primordial spirit does not perish.
It’s only that in your life’s numerous reincarnations, the dust has been
Layered on too thick, and you have forgotten your own memories. Today we
Have to follow the righteous path of artistic creation and through
Continuing to do good things, return to our old home.

Within art there are different levels, different personalities, and
Different realms, which compose different understandings of art. Art is
The outward expression of an artist’s inner world.

If you want to create a magnificent piece of art, you have to beautify
Your inner world. As the saying goes, chicken innards can’t give birth
To a phoenix. Only by becoming a phoenix can you give birth to one. The
Process of cleansing oneself is one of constantly assimilating to the
Higher characteristics of the universe. It is a continuous process of
Wisdom and enlightenment. It is synonymous with being “in the Tao
Without cultivating the Tao.""

A poem states: ""The flow of wisdom is one of purification. The
master climbs the ladder to heaven.”
 
In fact, it is the process of continuously removing the bad
thoughts of human beings, and returning to one’s original
heavenly home. At the same time, there is the law of “no loss, no gain”
and “good is rewarded and evil is punished” in the universe. Some people
say that art is the lubricant and accelerator for the rise and fall of
society. The artist is the engineer of the human soul. When you
create a series of good works and play a good role in human society,
isn’t this a great virtue? One’s virtue is as high as one’s
character. However much virtue you accumulate is how much glory
you will enjoy. Lives in the universe have hierarchies, and you will be
gods at different levels. Even if some painters are not satisfied with
their work, they will gain however much they put in. Their virtue will
be converted into blessings, such as becoming a big official or making a
fortune, in the next life. At the very least, you will not run with the
corrupted social atmosphere by creating tasteless works that endanger
humans and create karma. From this perspective, aren’t you not only
creating a glorious period for human art, but also paving the way for
your life’s eternal happiness?
 
As to what kind of standards the future world will set for art and
for artists, there is already zero doubt. Moreover, the worldwide
realistic oil painting competition held by NTD Television
has indeed played the role of sparking mutual dialogue and improvement.
 
For example, one artist never attended a fine arts academy, but won the
gold prize for two consecutive competitions. Another painter said that he
attended the authoritative Central Academy of Fine Arts in China,
with four years in the auxiliary department and five years in the
university department. However, he didn’t learn anything about artistic
creation, which he learned in the process of participating in this
competition. He won the competition’s highest award in 2014. The
awarding of the competition is fair by principle, because the
exhibitions are held openly, and the competition albums are preserved to
be gauged at any time. As another example, there was an artist whose
works have been exhibited in art museums around the world, and many of
his works have been collected. As he entered our competition as a famous
modern artist using realism techniques to express deviated modern
notions, we didn’t give him an award. After communicating with him, he
changed his mind with great conviction. He said while holding a thumbs
up, “Your motive for holding this competition is so great! The
philosophy is excellent!” He also wanted to return to tradition. The
name of his next solo exhibition was changed to “return"", and he also
bought two albums from the competition which he said he would place in
his exhibition. He asked me to say a few words to him. I said, “You are
a true artist!""
 
Many artists have given a lot of positive feedback. They very much
agree with the philosophy of the competition. In the previous
competition, a painter pointed to the foreword of the competition,
saying that he had already carefully read it four times, but still wants
to read it. Some people with strong experiences said that New Tang
Dynasty’s worldwide realistic oil painting competition is like a
lighthouse, in the sea of the night, gathering artists with similar
ideals; others have said that in the process of participating in the
contest, the light in their hearts brightened.
 
Below are two poems on the topic of artistic creation to share with
everyone.
 
Great Art
Techniques must be refined and pure
Great art needs good people.
A drive reaching heaven
Don’t be an ordinary artisan, be a great god.
 
Cultivate oneself to be pure and upright, optimistic and compassionate
From the minuscule to the vast
Broad thoughts reaching high, far, and deep
Inexhaustible,
Beautiful, wondrous, and new
Anointing the head with the finest cream, the opening of hearts and
aspirations
Once viewed, drunk in harmony, and a soul reconstructed
Exuberant and excelling, all heavenly works
 
Here’s a few more lines to share with those with exceptionally good
inborn quality and predestined relationships.
 
Returning Home
 
Righteous Cultivation, the springs and caves of wisdom opened
A pure and beautiful heart, heavenly works and divine light
Scattering golden light saving the world’s people
Carrying acclaim back to the heavenly celestial paradise
 
Since I cherish our predestined relationship to be with each other, I
wanted to share with everyone words from the bottom of my heart. Let’s
work together to create even more beautiful everlasting fine art!
Thank you all!
