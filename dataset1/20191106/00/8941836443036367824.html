      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - A 26-year-old Soldotna man reported missing on a hike Monday east of Fairbanks was found dead in a state recreation area.</p>
      <p>The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports state park rangers on all-terrain vehicles found the body of Jarred Allen in the Chena River State Recreation Area.</p>
      <p>Alaska State Troopers spokesman Ken Marsh says hypothermia is the suspected cause of death. Temperatures Sunday were in single digits.</p>
      <p>Allen left Friday on a solo hike and was due to return Sunday. His family reported him overdue Monday and a search was launched.</p>
      <p>Rangers found Allen in the Angel Creek Valley area off Mile 49 Chena Hot Springs Road. He was about 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) off the road and 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the upper Angel Creek Cabin.</p>
