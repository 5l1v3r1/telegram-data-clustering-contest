      <p><b>Topline</b>: Some right-wing news outlets and conservative circles in Washington—including Donald Trump Jr.—are actively trying to spread the identity of the alleged impeachment whistleblower, while major news outlets decline to publish the name amid concerns for the whistleblower’s safety.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, tweeted a link on Wednesday to a Breitbart article that named the alleged whistleblower, immediately drawing <a href="https://twitter.com/BradMossEsq/status/1192088369079173122?s=20">criticism </a>that he was putting the whistleblower in danger (Trump Jr.’s tweet also included the name of the alleged whistleblower).</li>
        <li>Right-wing outlets, including Rush Limbaugh on his radio show, have been circulating the name of the alleged whistleblower since last week, citing an October 30 Real Clear Investigations report that included a name and photo of the alleged whistleblower. Executives at Fox News, though, have instructed hosts not to name the whistleblower, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/media/fox-news-whistleblower/index.html">reported</a>.</li>
        <li>Real Clear Investigations is an offshoot of RealClearPolitics, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. (RealClearPolitics did not immediately respond to request for comment from <i>Forbes</i>.)</li>
        <li>With the exception of Real Clear Investigations, major news outlets (including <i>Forbes</i>) have published scant details about the whistleblower, according to <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i> media writer Paul Farhi, because of “several factors: concerns that revealing the name could jeopardize the whistleblower’s safety; legal questions about whether the whistleblower’s identity is protected by federal law; and potential adverse public reaction to such a disclosure.”</li>
        <li>Both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/news-organizations-resist-trumps-pressure-to-release-whistleblowers-name/2019/11/05/b6bfebb4-ffee-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html#comments-wrapper">Dean Baquet</a>, executive editor of the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/7a6152e027314083b3a0c238416b7bd8?utm_medium=AP_CorpComm&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">Associated Press</a> added that the identity of the whistleblower is almost a moot point because a call transcript released by the White House and on-the-record testimony from top administration officials have confirmed much of what the whistleblower alleged. </li>
        <li>Trump Jr. dismissed the outrage, saying in a follow-up <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1192123247908868096?s=20">tweet: </a>“Are they going to pretend that his name hasn’t been in the public domain for weeks now? Numerous people &amp; news outlets including Real Clear Politics already ID’d him.”</li>
        <li>While whistleblowers have some protections under federal law, there is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/06/776481504/can-trump-legally-out-the-whistleblower-experts-say-it-would-not-violate-any-law">no statute </a>stopping the president or a member of Congress from revealing their name. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: While RealClearPolitics is the only nonpartisan outlet to reveal the name of the whistleblower, the <i>New York Times </i>in September <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/who-is-whistleblower.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">published </a>some details about him, including the fact that he is a male CIA officer who was detailed to work at the White House. Since then, other outlets have corroborated the <i>New York Times</i> but have not published additional details.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Trump himself and some members of Congress, including senators <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/469156-paul-says-he-probably-will-disclose-whistleblowers-name">Rand Paul</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBXOIKLdPuI">Lindsey Graham</a>, have called on the whistleblower’s identity to be revealed, with Graham, according to the Associated Press, saying Wednesday that, “Nobody should be prosecuted based on an anonymous accusation.” Earlier this month, Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/464053-trump-rails-against-whistleblower-spy-within-administration">called </a>the whistleblower a “spy” working to undermine his administration.</p>
      <p><b>Chief critics</b>: The whistleblower’s lawyer, Andrew Bakaj, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBakaj/status/1192111439667965953?s=20">said </a>in a statement that he could neither confirm nor deny the whistleblower’s identity, and that anyone publishing the name of the suspected whistleblower “puts that individual and their family at risk of serious harm.”</p>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions in response to a phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky. On the July call, Trump directed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption. Trump and Rudy Giuliani claim that then-vice president Biden pushed for the resignation of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in an effort to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a board seat.</p>
