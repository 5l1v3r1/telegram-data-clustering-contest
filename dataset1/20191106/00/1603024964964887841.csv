The Nifty50 gained strength in late morning deals to touch the psychological 12,000 level intraday for the first time since June 11 and closed higher on November 6, driven by private banks and some technology stocks.
The index formed bullish candle on daily charts as dips are being bought into and the supports are gradually shifting higher. Though, at the end of the session, it failed to hold 12,000 levels. Notably, it has been respecting the rising support trendline.
Experts expect the consolidation to continue in the near term unless the index sees a strong breakout on either side for a directional move and breaking out 12,000 on closing may take the Nifty to its earlier record high.

""Nifty50 smartly recoiled from the intraday lows of 11,850 after almost testing its near term support levels on lower time frame charts which resulted in a bullish candle with a slightly longer lower shadow. This recover, without a follow-through to the bearish candle formation witnessed in last Tuesday's session is clearly suggesting that index is caught up in a sideways ways and shall remain directionless unless a decisive breakout is registered in either of the directions,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist, Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.
He said for time being consolidation zone appears to be between 12,000–11,850 levels and going forward a swift move should be expected in the direction of a breakout.
In case of an upward breakout above 12,000 levels then initial targets shall be 12,103 levels whereas breach of 11,850 on closing basis shall initially drag down the index towards the zone of 11,740-11,700 levels, he added.
