東協峰會：被美國「放鴿子」，中國來填空？
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by 德國之聲


我們想讓你知道的是東協峰會使得相關國家能夠在和其它世界大國接觸時作為一個整體統一發聲，提高它在安全以及貿易事務中的影響力。如今，它已經成為北京和華盛頓角力的競技場。



文：任琛、石濤
美國總統川普（Donald Trump）決定不出席在泰國舉行的東協國家峰會後，7個東南亞國協的領導人本週一（11月4日）聯合缺席和美國代表的會議。
在以往的東協峰會上，代表美國出席的都是總統、副總統或國務卿級別的高層領導人。而在此次召開的「東協－美國峰會」上，美方派出的最高級別代表是剛剛上任的國家安全顧問羅伯特・奧布萊恩（Robert O'Brien）。與此相對照的是，其它10個東協國家紛紛派出政府最高領導人出席會議。
美國CNBC新聞網在報導中指出，去（2018）年，川普還派出了副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）出席東協峰會，如今兩人都忙著在本土搞選戰。分析人士向CNBC表示，美國的缺席將為中國留下更大的空間，以進一步提高其在該地區的知名度和影響力。
中國派出的最高級別代表是國務院總理李克強，他在峰會上公開表示：中國和東協國家始終相互尊重、平等相待，秉持睦鄰友好、求同存異，都主張通過對話協商妥善解決爭議。李克強認為，東亞能成為一片遠離戰亂紛擾的和平綠洲和世界經濟三大板塊之一，離不開中國和東協的共同努力。
給美國「some color to see see」
週一召開的峰會上，只有東道主泰國，也就是東協輪值主席國以及越南和寮國的國家領導人出席和美方的會晤。東協其它成員國——新加坡、馬來西亞、印尼、汶萊、柬埔寨、緬甸和菲律賓的最高級別領導人紛紛缺席。
一位不願意透露身份的東協國家外交人員向美聯社表示，儘管美方官員呼籲全體東協成員國領導人應該出席相關會議，但除了泰國、以及下一屆峰會的東道主越南，以及負責觀察東協和美國關係的寮國以外，其它國家均只派出外交部長參會。
美聯社報導稱，東協峰會使得相關國家能夠在和其它世界大國接觸時作為一個整體統一發聲，提高它在安全以及貿易事務中的影響力。如今，它已經成為北京和華盛頓角力的競技場，雙方都尋求提高在這個對於地緣政治來說極其重要地區的影響力。
留下的真空，誰來填補？
美聯社在報導中指出，川普缺席此次峰會，同時也不派出副總統彭斯或者國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）代替出席的做法，為其它全球大國的領導人留下了可以填補的真空，比如日本首相安倍和印度總理莫迪（Narendra Modi），還尤其包括中國總理李克強。
菲律賓財政部長多明戈斯（Carlos Dominguez）向媒體表示：「我猜想各國領導人想和他國的同級領導人會晤……這只是一個級別對等的問題。」
美方代表奧布萊恩在峰會上宣讀了一份川普的親筆信，其中向東協各國領導人發出了明（2020）年年初在美國出席「特別峰會」的邀請。
東協十國的經濟總量不可小視，成員國總人口數目接近6億5000萬。在每年召開的峰會中，東協各國會首先召開成員國之間的會議，然後才和盟外國家，包括美國、中國、日本、澳大利亞和印度等國代表舉行峰會。
東協各國領導人表示，很高興看到各方就「區域全面經濟夥伴關係」（RCEP）這一大規模自由貿易協定的基本框架達成一致，而這是為期7年談判磋商的結果。如果一切順利，明年年初可以正式簽署。CNBC報導稱，中國在這一貿易協定中佔主導地位，美國缺席的同時，東協各國已經為這一協議的簽署鋪平了道路。不過最新消息傳出，印度政府表示對協議仍有疑慮，目前仍未決定加入。

ASEAN Summit: Is the United States ""filling the pigeons"" and China filling in the blanks?
06 Nov 2019, 00:21 by Voice of Germany


What we want you to know is that the ASEAN Summit enables the countries concerned to speak as a whole when they are in contact with other world powers, and to improve their influence in security and trade affairs. Today, it has become the arena of Beijing and Washington.

After US President Donald Trump decided not to attend the ASEAN Summit in Thailand, the leaders of the seven Southeast Asian Nations Associations jointly held a meeting with the US delegates on Monday (November 4).
At the previous ASEAN summit, representatives representing the United States were senior leaders at the presidential, vice-president or secretary-state level. At the ""ASEAN-US Summit"" held this time, the highest-level representative of the US was the newly appointed national security adviser Robert O'Brien. In contrast, the other 10 ASEAN countries have sent the top leaders of the government to attend the meeting.
CNBC News Network pointed out in the report that in the year of (2018), Trump also sent Vice President Mike Pence to attend the ASEAN Summit. Now both of them are busy in the local election campaign. Analysts told CNBC that the absence of the United States would leave more room for China to further increase its visibility and influence in the region.
The highest-ranking representative sent by China is Li Keqiang, the premier of the State Council. He publicly stated at the summit that China and the ASEAN countries have always respected each other and treated each other as equals, upholding good-neighborliness and friendship, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and all advocated properly resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation. Li Keqiang believes that East Asia can become one of the three major oasis of peace and the world economy from the chaos of war. It is inseparable from the joint efforts of China and the ASEAN.
To the United States ""some color to see see""
At the summit held on Monday, only the host country Thailand, the rotating presidency of the ASEAN and the national leaders of Vietnam and Laos, attended the meeting with the US. The top leaders of other ASEAN member states - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines - were absent.
An ASEAN national diplomat who did not want to disclose his identity told the Associated Press that although US officials called on all ASEAN member states to attend the relevant meeting, in addition to Thailand and the host of the next summit, Vietnam, and responsible for observation Outside the Laos, where the ASEAN and the United States are related, other countries only send foreign ministers to the meeting.
The Associated Press reported that the ASEAN Summit enabled the countries concerned to speak as a whole when they contacted other world powers, improving their influence in security and trade affairs. Today, it has become an arena for Beijing and Washington, and both sides seek to increase their influence in this region that is extremely important for geopolitics.
The vacuum left, who will fill it?
The Associated Press reported in the report that Trump was absent from the summit and did not send Vice President Peng Si or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to replace the attendance, leaving the leaders of other global powers to fill. Vacuum, such as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, especially including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
Philippine Finance Minister Carlos Dominguez told the media: ""I suspect that leaders want to meet with other leaders in other countries... This is just a level of reciprocity.""
U.S. representative O'Brien read a copy of Trump's personal letter at the summit, which sent an invitation to ASEAN leaders to attend the ""Special Summit"" in the United States at the beginning of 2020.
The total economic volume of the 10 ASEAN countries cannot be underestimated. The total population of member states is close to 650 million. In the annual summit, the ASEAN countries will first hold meetings between member states, and then hold summits with representatives of other countries, including the United States, China, Japan, Australia and India.
ASEAN leaders said that they are pleased to see the parties agree on the basic framework of the ""Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership"" (RCEP), a large-scale free trade agreement, which is the result of seven years of negotiations. If all goes well, it can be officially signed at the beginning of next year. CNBC reported that China is dominant in this trade agreement, and while the United States is absent, the ASEAN countries have paved the way for the signing of this agreement. However, the latest news came out that the Indian government expressed doubts about the agreement and has not yet decided to join.
