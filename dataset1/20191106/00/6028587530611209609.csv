Topline: President Donald Trump suffered a key defeat in the last state elections before next year’s presidential election as Democrat Andy Beshear claimed victory over incumbent Republican governor Matt Bevin in the conservative-leaning state of Kentucky.

State Attorney General Beshear, whose father, Steve, was the last Democratic governor of the state, won 49.2% of the vote to Bevin’s 48.8%.
Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes called the election in Beshear’s favour, but Bevin has refused to concede, citing “irregularities” in the voting process.
Campaign support for Bevin from Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other Republican heavyweights failed to appeal to Kentucky voters.
Bevin’s Trump-like attacks on teachers and the rollback of Medicaid meant the Kentucky governor had a 56% disapproval rating, one of the lowest nationally for governors, at the start of his reelection campaign.
In another landmark victory, Democrats seized full control of Virginia’s government for the first time in almost 20 years. The win will allow the Democrats to push forward progressive policies blocked by the Republicans, presumably including increasing the minimum wage and new gun control laws.
Republicans did hold on to the consistently red state of Mississippi, where voters were split on the issue of Medicaid. Governor Tate Reeves campaigned against the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and defeated Democrat Jim Hood with a 52.3% vote share, after trailing earlier in the polls.

Key background: Last night’s results come at a crucial time for Donald Trump, as he rallies support for his reelection campaign and against a congressional impeachment inquiry that is quickly gaining traction. The day before the election, Trump tried to boost the Bevin campaign with a rally in Lexington in which he warned that a loss for Bevin would strengthen the House Democrats’ plan to impeach him for pressuring Ukraine’s leader to investigate Joe Biden’s son. At the rally, Trump said that Democrats seizing the governor’s mansion in Frankfort would be “the greatest defeat in the history of the world.” After votes were counted, Trump embarked on damage control by hailing his part in boosting Bevin’s poll numbers.
Still, last night’s result could spell trouble for next year, as Trump won Kentucky by 30 points in 2016. Beshear’s win also poses a threat to Senate majority leader and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who is up for reelection in 2020.
What to watch for: A possible review of the vote. Despite Beshear claiming victory with a majority of more than 5,000 votes, Bevin is still not conceding and has cited “irregularities.” He points to a “process being followed” before he admits defeat. For a review to take place, Bevin would need to formally request one from the secretary of state or the county board of elections would have to find a discrepancy in the process, according to USA Today.
It’s worth noting that Bevin faced a recanvassing process after his narrow 2015 win against James Comer in the primaries for governor, in which he achieved a drastically smaller majority of 83 votes. Comer requested the review, but the result went unchanged.
