      <h1>Democrats expand edge in California as 2020 looms</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - With the 2020 elections approaching, California voter registration figures released Wednesday tell a familiar story: Democrats are expanding their ranks, Republicans are struggling, and the fastest-growing group remains those voters aligned with no party at all - independents.</p>
      <p>The trajectory highlights long-running trends in the strongly Democratic state, where the party holds every statewide office, dominates both chambers of the Legislature and counts a more than 4 million voter edge in registrations.</p>
      <p>The figures by Secretary of State Alex Padilla also showed Democrats gaining ground in some highly competitive U.S. House districts the party snagged from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party/">GOP</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>Overall, California had 20,328,636 voters as of Oct. 1. Nearly 81 percent of eligible residents are registered to vote, the highest percentage since 1952, Padilla said.</p>
      <p>According to the figures, Democrats account for 44 percent of registered voters, up about 1 point from the same time before the 2016 presidential primary election. They increased their numbers during that span to 8.9 million voters, up from 7.4 million in 2016.</p>

      <p>Republicans account for about 24 percent of the total, down several points from 2016. The party’s statewide registration numbers remained essentially flat during the four-year span, tallying about 4.8 million in the latest count.</p>
      <p>The fastest-growing group was independents, who represent nearly 27 percent of registered voters. The number of unaffiliated voters, who technically register as “no party preference,” climbed to 5.4 million in October, a more than 30 percent jump from 2016.</p>
      <p>The latest data underscore trends that have seen the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party/">GOP</a> become largely irrelevant in statewide politics, though the party retains pockets of political power, particularly in rural areas.</p>
      <p>Then-candidate Donald Trump lost California in the 2016 presidential election by over 4 million votes to Hillary Clinton. The most recent Republican presidential candidate to carry the state was George H.W. Bush in 1988.</p>

        <p>In the 2018 elections, Democrats grabbed a string of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party/">GOP</a>-held House seats in a rout, giving the party a 46-7 edge over Republicans in the state.</p>
        <p>In some competitive congressional districts in Southern California, the recent tally appeared encouraging for Democrats.</p>
        <p>At this point before the 2018 primaries, Republicans held a slim registration edge in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party/">GOP</a>-held 39th District, which was picked up by Democrat Gil Cisneros that year. But the advantage has flipped: Democrats now hold a 2-point edge in registration, the figures showed.</p>
        <p>In Orange County’s 45th District, which was captured last year by Democrat Katie Porter, Republicans held an 8-point registration edge in the months before the 2018 primary. Heading toward the 2020 contests, that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/republican-party/">GOP</a> advantage has been cut in half.</p>
        <p>In the nearby 48th District, which was captured by Democrat Harley Rouda last year, Republicans had a comfortable 11-point advantage heading into the 2018 primary. That edge is now 7 points, the figures showed.</p>
