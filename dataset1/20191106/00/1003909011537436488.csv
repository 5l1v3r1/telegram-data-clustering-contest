Up to 300 teachers could be cut, fees hiked as CBE struggles with tough UCP budget
06 Nov 2019, 00:27 by Eva Ferguson



Public schools could see cuts of up to 300 teachers, increased class sizes and significant fee hikes in response to the UCP’s tough budget presented almost two weeks ago.
Expressing shock and disbelief, officials with the Calgary Board of Education estimate provincial cuts to three critical grants, including the classroom improvement fund and the class size initiative fund, will result in a $32-million reduction for this school year.
And with teachers funded at around $100,000 in average salaries, that could translate to about 320 teachers, depending on where else the CBE makes cuts.
But when inflation and other reductions kick in, including the payout of teacher contracts over the next few months, CBE chief financial officer Brad Grundy estimates the $32-million funding loss could translate to about $48 million in cuts by January.
“We will have to lay off more people to achieve the necessary savings,” Grundy said.
“Given the growing complexity of our classrooms, this will be a challenge.”
On Oct. 24, the UCP government announced funding for K-12 education will remain frozen at $8.2 billion, equal to the former NDP government’s spending last year and continuing at that same level for the next three years.
Officials argued that enrolment growth would be funded through a 2.2 per cent hike in instructional services, going from $6.3 billion to $6.4 billion by 2022-23.
Education Minister Adriana LaGrange said Tuesday at the legislature she expects the CBE to find further efficiencies.
“I find it surprising that a school division that has 130,000 students and close to a $1.2-billion budget cannot find further efficiencies. This is what they are elected to do.”
But Barb Silva, spokeswoman for SOS Alberta, said offloading funding challenges to local boards is irresponsible.
“This government is actively working against public education. There is a consistent and deliberate effort to underfund and undermine school boards across the province as evidenced by the repeated emphasis of the minister regarding school board autonomy,” Silva said.
“This is simply a way to deflect from the responsibility this government has to adequately fund public education across Alberta.”
But the CBE says the addition of 2,400 new students this school year means the funding freeze will merely translate to a funding shortfall, which will impact students and teachers on multiple levels.
Grundy explained that while teaching jobs are expected to be cut, educational assistants and administrative positions could also be lost.

Bob Cocking, president of Calgary Public Teachers Local 38 of the Alberta Teachers’ Association, said cuts to teaching jobs in the middle of a school year will be extremely disruptive.
“It should never have been down to a guessing game when we are dealing with the education of our students,” Cocking said Tuesday after the CBE board meeting.
“The extremely late budget release and the implications this now brings to our school systems is definitely a travesty. Schools have been in session for at least two months and to make changes now will have a huge strain on our schools, staff, students and their parents.”
Officials with the Calgary Catholic School District issued a statement Tuesday saying they are also facing a “multimillion-dollar” cut to their budget, but would not provide details.
“The grant funding cut in the provincial budget has been a lot steeper than anticipated, which means we have had to rework our budget assumptions and calculations,” said CCSD spokeswoman Felicia Zuniga.
“While we intend to make the best possible choices for the students and families we serve, as well as our staff, the realities of the provincial budget will make this significantly more challenging.”
Over the next month, CBE officials will also look for further efficiencies in administrative services, from technology to classroom and school equipment, as well as increases to school fees.
Under the former NDP government, students attending their designated school and living more than 2.4 kilometres away were subsidized for bus fees, ranging from $360 for a yellow bus, to as much as $700 for junior high and high school students on Calgary Transit.
The CBE benefited last year from a $54-million class size initiative grant, a $13-million classroom improvement grant and an $18-million fee replacement grant, Grundy said.
But after the UCP budget, all of those grants have disappeared, and have been replaced with one transitional grant of $24 million and an additional $29 million for growth.

So, last year’s overall funding of $85 million has been cut to $53 million, resulting in a loss of $32 million which will probably total nearly $48 million by the end of the year.
Board chair Marilyn Dennis said she was surprised the cuts to CBE funding were this deep and significant.
“We can say now with certainty that the Alberta budget will have significant impacts on Calgary students and teachers,” she said.
“All of this despite an enrolment increase of 2,400 students — that’s equal to four full elementary schools.”
Meanwhile, the UCP gave school boards another surprise Tuesday, announcing several schools to be built across the province are being considered for a public-private partnership for capital funding.
In the Calgary area, those schools include a public K-4 school in Auburn Bay and a K-9 Catholic school in Cochrane.
“We are investing in infrastructure that is financially sustainable, drives the economy and creates jobs. Alternative financing and public-private partnerships are being closely considered where they can provide on-time and on-budget results,” said Minister of Infrastructure Prasad Panda.
But Thomas Dang, infrastructure critic for the Opposition NDP, said so-called P3s are not a good return on investment.
“The P3 school model will be a disaster for Albertans. We’ve seen them try this before and we’ve seen them fail. I’ve seen it in my riding … students had to walk through mud pits just to get to school.
“This is going to cost Albertans more and it’s going to give us less.”
