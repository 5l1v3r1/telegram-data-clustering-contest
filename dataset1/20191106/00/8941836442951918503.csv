Blade of glory: The mystery around a late president’s sword
06 Nov 2019 by DAN SEWELL
CINCINNATI (AP) - An Ohio sheriff plans to update the investigation into the ownership of a sword wielded in the American Revolution and by a future president in the War of 1812.
Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Neil scheduled a news conference Wednesday about the sword linked to William Henry Harrison and before him, his future father-in-law, Continental Army Col. John Cleves Symmes.
Police in Connecticut seized the sword last month, just hours before it was going up for auction with a $15,000 minimum bid.
Members of the Harrison-Symmes Memorial Foundation some 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Cincinnati suspect it is a historical sword that disappeared 40 years ago from the Cincinnati Historical Society.

The would-be seller says that he believes his sword is authentic and that the Cincinnati sword was a copy.
