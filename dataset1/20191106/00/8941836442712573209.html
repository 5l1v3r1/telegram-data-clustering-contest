      <p>PARIS (AP) - The Paris prosecutor’s office is investigating French director <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christophe-ruggia/">Christophe Ruggia</a> for alleged “sexual aggressions” after French actress <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adele-haenel/">Adele Haenel</a> accused him of sexually harassing her when she was an adolescent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adele-haenel/">Haenel</a>, now 30, first detailed her allegations against Ruggia Sunday on the French investigative website Mediapart. She says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christophe-ruggia/">Ruggia</a>, who directed her first film, “Les Diables”, repeatedly touched her inappropriately when she was between 12 and 15 years old.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christophe-ruggia/">Ruggia</a> has categorically denied the allegations via his lawyer Jean-Pierre Versini.</p>
      <p>The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed to The Associated Press that an inquiry opened Wednesday into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/christophe-ruggia/">Ruggia</a> for “sexual aggressions against a 15-year-old minor.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/adele-haenel/">Haenel</a> told French media this week that she did not wish to file a formal complaint because she didn’t trust the French justice system.</p>
