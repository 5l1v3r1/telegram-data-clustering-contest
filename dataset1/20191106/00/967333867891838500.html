      <p>ABC News faced some inconvenient questions Tuesday about its decision to ditch interview with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts taken by Amy Robach three years ago after a video recording of Robach fuming about the network’s refusal was released online by Project Veritas.</p>
      <p>In the video recording, Robach <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077206075-watch-hillary-clinton-laughs-when-asked-how-she-suicided-jeffrey-epstein/">can be heard expressing indignation</a> about an editorial decision to not air the interview with Epstein’s accuser despite having the material years before Epstein came into mainstream media’s spotlight.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve had the story for three years… we would not put it on the air,” Robach says. “It was unbelievable what we had, [Bill] Clinton, we had everything.”</blockquote>

      <p>According to Robach, the network killed the story for several reasons. The editors first claimed that nobody knew at the time who Epstein was. Roback also suggested that the interview <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910201077101686-jeffrey-epsteins-discovered-address-book-had-13-contact-numbers-for-prince-andrew---report/">would smear Prince Andrew</a>, and this fact became known to the UK Royal Palace, who then put pressure on the network.</p>
      <blockquote>“We would not put it on the air. First of all, I was told, who’s Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story," Robach said on the video. "Then, the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways. We were so afraid we wouldn’t be able to interview Kate and Will that we, that also, quashed the story.”</blockquote>
      <p>She alleged that Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, pressed ABC into dropping the story.</p>
      <blockquote>“I tried for three years to get (the interview) on to no avail and now it's coming out and it's like these 'new revelations' and I freaking had all of it,” she said, visibly exasperated.</blockquote>
      <p>When contacted by Fox News, ABC downplayed the decision, saying that at the time the interview did not meet their editorial standards to be aired.</p>
      <blockquote>“At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it," a network spokesperson told Fox News. </blockquote>
      <p>ABC denied that external pressure influenced the editorial decision. </p>
      <p>The network said that continued investigation into Epstein led to the creation of a two-hour documentary and six-part podcast scheduled to air next year. It is unclear how much of Robach’s work will be represented.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Robach issued a statement acknowledging her interview did not meet the airing standards at the time. She also admitted the network never told her to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910311077184517-epstein-familys-pathologist-suggests-sex-offender-died-of-homicidal-strangulation/">drop her investigation</a> into Epstein.</p>
      <blockquote>"The interview itself, while I was disappointed it didn't air, didn't meet our standards," Robach said on Tuesday. “As a journalist, as the Epstein story continued to unfold last summer, I was caught in a private moment of frustration. I was upset that an important interview I had conducted with [Epstein accuser] Virginia Roberts didn’t air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC’s editorial standards about her allegations.”</blockquote>
      <p>"In the years since no one has ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein, and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story,” she added. </p>
      <p>Project Veritas, which released Robach’s emotional clip, is a private group that aims to “investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct in both public and private institutions in order to achieve a more ethical and transparent society.” According to AP, the Project is notorious for sending undercover reporters to catch employees making statements that display political bias.</p>
