      <p>It’s November, and that means the holiday drink lineup is returning to Starbucks. So are those reusable red holiday cups that are a giveaway on the first day when the holiday drinks go one sale.</p>
      <p>You might remember what happened in 2018, when Starbucks had far fewer cups available than customers who wanted them. (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2018/11/02/starbucks-holiday-offer-of-a-reusable-cup-gets-off-to-a-crashing-start/#4ab1f726b573">I was among the people who tried to get one.</a>)</p>
      <p>This year, Starbucks is making it clear that you need to be prompt.</p>
      <p>“Come in early tomorrow to get a free reusable red cup with the purchase of your favorite handcrafted holiday beverage,” Starbucks said in a email to its Rewards members on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Hurry—these won't last long, and we only have a limited number. Available at participating stores.”</p>
      <p>Through Jan. 6, customers can bring the cups back after <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_313905248061466182_">2 p.m.</a> to get 50 cents off a grande size holiday beverage. And, the company hopes many people will do so.</p>
      <p>“This year, we have made great strides to create inventory in all of our stores, so actually merchandise is in stores now, and we feel confident about securing a large supply of red cups,” Starbucks’ Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer said Monday, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/starbucks-sticks-to-the-classics-for-its-holiday-menu.html">in an interview with CNBC.</a></p>
      <p>What’s this year’s holiday drinks lineup? Well, it’s going to look pretty familiar to people who’ve purchased the Starbucks holiday beverages in the past.</p>
      <p>It includes the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, the Eggnog Latte and the Peppermint Mocha, which is now 17 years old.</p>
      <p>American customers won’t find the Gingerbread Latte, although it will be available in Canada. (Here’s why brands offer special flavors – or flavours – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2019/09/26/o-canada-why-mcdonalds-tim-hortons-and-starbucks-are-testing-new-food-items-up-north/#6f886dbe41e4">in the True North</a>.)</p>
      <p>I won’t miss the Gingerbread Latte, but I was hoping Starbucks would bring back<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2018/11/30/starbucks-juniper-latte-is-jumping-on-a-growing-winter-flavor-trend/#315cac902425"> the Juniper Latte.</a></p>
      <p>It had a decided European sensibility, but it was a flavor that generated a mixed reaction. I thought it was pleasantly sophisticated; others thought it reminded them of Pine Sol or cheap car air freshener.</p>
      <p>Along with the holiday drinks, Starbucks also is teaming up with Alaska Airlines <a href="https://blog.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/starbucks-red-cup/">on a special tie-in.</a></p>
      <p>Starting on Thursday, anyone traveling with a Starbucks holiday cup will receive priority boarding on all Alaska Airlines flights. The promotion lasts through Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Starbucks cup holders will be allowed to board in the“espresso” lane (clever, huh?) following Group B, which is the third priority group.</p>
      <p>Customers can bring any Starbucks beverage, as long as it is in a holiday cup, and it’s okay to finish your drink and just carry the cup on board.</p>
      <p>Alaska Air, which has had an association with Starbucks for years, is promising additional Starbucks goodies for some passengers on some flights.</p>
      <p>Now, you may be aware that Starbucks is testing compostable cups at the airports in San Francisco, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Atlanta. So, the holiday cups won’t be available at some outlets in those places, only holiday sleeves.</p>
      <p>These, plus the regular cup, will earn Alaska Air passengers the early boarding priority.</p>
      <p>The fourth quarter is a big deal for Starbucks, which gets a boost not only from its holiday drinks, but from carry over sales of Pumpkin Spice items as well as people purchasing gift cards.</p>
      <p>So, the holiday focus makes perfect sense, given the company’s recent run up in its stock price. Starbucks shares are up 26 percent this year.</p>
