      <p>The <a href="https://jaxjox.com/product/foam-rollerconnect/"><b>JAXJOX Foam RollerConnect</b></a> fitness device ($99) uses your iPhone 11 to track and optimize muscle recovery. Through five intensity zones, it activates sore or injured muscles by vibrating at optimal frequencies. Just touch a button, select the workout activity you've just completed, and the roller determines how long you should recover and at what intensity level. Or you can take manual control. All the while, you can track your progress on your phone via the JAXJOX or Apple Health app.</p>

It looks like something James Bond might wear. An improvement over its predecessor, the outer shell was upgraded to an ultra-durable, wind-resistant, heavier micro pique. Two extra layers of insulation were also added to create a unique triple-layered construction. It’s also lined with an extra layer of wind-resistant, double-bonded micro fleece, to keep your hands warm and comfortable.</p>
