New for 2019! Explore our solution for analytical scientists challenged with capturing qualitative and quantitative information for a large numbers of analytes. Revolutionize your screening, omics or metabolite identification with the TripleTOF® 6600+ LC-MS/MS System.
The Triple TOF 6600+ System is a fast-scanning, sensitive, high-resolution mass spectrometer capable of profiling complex samples, identifying and quantifying thousands of species simultaneously and reducing missing data. It provides a more comprehensive understanding of sample makeup, biology or dynamics.
You get enhanced sensitivity with simple, robust, low-flow applications using the new OptiFlow® Turbo V Ion Source combined with Scanning SWATH® Acquisition. This next generation of data independent analysis makes the system a powerful solution for eliminating missing data in your high-resolution approaches, and lets you get to the answers that really matter. 
Learn more about the Triple TOF 6600+ System from our exclusive online presentations.
