The Nifty50 had a touch and go moment with 12,000 levels for the first time since June 11. Meanwhile, the S&P BSE Sensex rallied to a fresh record high of 40,606.91 in intraday trade on November 6.
Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 221 points to a record closing high of 40,469 while the Nifty50 ended 48 points higher at record closing high of 11,966. It hit an intraday high of 12,002 and an intraday low of 11,850.
Positive commentary from the Finance Minister, a bounce-back in banking space, as well as some stable results from India Inc, helped the sentiment. Experts feel that the upside is intact and investors should use dips to accumulate stocks or create long positions.
