      <p>Fantasy sports in the U.S. continues to grow and shows no signs of slowing down. The U.S. fantasy sports industry has grown from an estimated 32 million players in the US + Canada in 2010 to 59.3 million in 2017. And the industry grew in the U.S. from 42 million in 2015 to 45.9 million in 2019 (all stats according to <a href="https://thefsga.org/industry-demographics/">TheFSGA.org</a>).</p>
      <p>With the Supreme Court in the US overturning the Federal law (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992">PASPA</a>) that had essentially limited sports betting to Nevada, individual states are passing laws to enable legal sports betting. So far in 2019, 17 states have passed laws to legalize sports betting (many are still in the stage of writing regulations and not live yet). These new laws will have an impact on the fantasy sports industry.</p>
      <p>While some fear that sports betting will crowd out fantasy sports, so far the evidence is that sports betting will only enhance the growth of fantasy sports. A survey from the FSGA showed that 87 percent of fantasy players in states with legal sports betting played the same or more fantasy sports than the prior year. DraftKings has said that fantasy sports players in New Jersey continue to grow even with the rapid growth of sports betting in the state.<i> </i></p>
