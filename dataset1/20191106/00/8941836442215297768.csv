Undisclosed settlement reached over deadly Honolulu fire

06 Nov 2019

HONOLULU (AP) - A settlement has been reached over a deadly Honolulu high-rise fire, although the amounts to be paid by insurance companies to plaintiffs remains confidential.
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that a settlement conference was concluded Tuesday regarding the July 2017 Marco Polo building fire that killed four people.
Officials say the fire at the 568-unit building was one of the worst in modern Honolulu history, requiring the efforts of about 130 firefighters.
A judge has ordered defendants to make financial disbursements out of an escrow account by Jan. 15.
The settlement appears to resolve several lawsuits filed over the fire that caused an estimated $107 million in damage.


Attorneys say they are not allowed to discuss settlement amounts their clients are expected to receive.
