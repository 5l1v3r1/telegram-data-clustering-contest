      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A judge has taken 10 years off the sentence of an Alaska militia leader imprisoned for a conspiracy to murder government officials.</p>
      <p>Alaska Public Media reported Wednesday that 35-year-old Schaeffer Cox was resentenced Tuesday in Washington state.</p>
      <p>A 2017 appeals court decision overturned Cox’s conviction for solicitation to commit murder.</p>
      <p>The 10-year reduction to his sentence of 25 years coupled with about seven years already served leaves Cox with eight more years in prison.</p>
      <p>Cox was a self-described sovereign citizen and leader of the Fairbanks-based Alaska Peacemakers Militia.</p>

      <p>He was charged in 2010 with failure to notify a police officer he was carrying a handgun.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors successfully presented evidence of a plot by Cox and other militia members to kidnap or kill government or law enforcement officials.</p>
