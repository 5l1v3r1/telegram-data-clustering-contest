      <p>BEIJING (AP) - Chinese leader <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi Jinping</a> on Wednesday hailed a visit by French President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Emmanuel Macron</a> as giving a boost to multilateralism and free trade, amid ongoing economic tensions with Washington.</p>
      <p>The two countries also pledged continued support for the Paris Agreement as the U.S. begins its withdrawal from the landmark climate deal.</p>
      <p>Following a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> said the two leaders had sent “a strong signal to the world about steadfastly upholding multilateralism and free trade, as well as working together to build open economies.”</p>
      <p>In his remarks, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> and Europe “share the same feeling that trade war only results in losers.”</p>
      <p>“Developing market access and partnerships between our companies is a priority,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> and France signed commercial agreements Wednesday with a total value of $15 billion, covering areas including aviation, finance and environmental protection.</p>
      <p>The French leader’s visit is timed to ease some of the tensions that are stifling global commerce, with the U.S. and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> in a bitter fight over tariffs and the EU pressing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> to make good on commitments to boost imports of agricultural products and manufactured goods while opening its market for financial products and other services.</p>
      <p>During a joint briefing with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> appeared to take a jab at the U.S., which began this week the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> expressed “regret” over “some countries’ negative attitude” toward environmental protection and the fight against climate change, pledging to work with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> on halting the loss of biodiversity. The French president’s office also released a statement Wednesday that reaffirmed France and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s joint support for the “irreversible” Paris Agreement.</p>

        <p>On the issue of fundamental freedoms and human rights, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> said that he and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> discussed their respective positions. Western leaders have been under pressure to address the five months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> visited the commercial hub of Shanghai, where he visited a sprawling import fair and presided at the ribbon cutting for a branch of Paris’ famed Centre Pompidou modern art museum along the Chinese city’s riverfront.</p>
        <p>Designed by British architect David Chipperfield, the Pompidou Shanghai embodies <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s aspirations to become a center of culture as well as business, although the ruling Communist Party strict demands for ideological purity have caused some to question whether it can succeed at such a quest.</p>
        <p>The Pompidou will assemble items for exhibit at the Shanghai outpost from among its huge collections under a five-year contract.</p>
