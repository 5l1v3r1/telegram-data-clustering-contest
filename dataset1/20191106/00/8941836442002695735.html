      <p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A judge has allowed Rhode Island’s ban on the sale of flavored vaping products to stand.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-providence-journal/">The Providence Journal</a> reports Superior Court Judge Brian Stern denied an industry association’s request Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against the ban. Stern said the state health department was within its powers to rule the products are an “imminent peril” to the public.</p>
      <p>The Washington-based Vapor Technology Association and the owner of RI e-Cig and Vapes, Donna Dionne, sued Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and the state’s health director last month.</p>
      <p>They argued the emergency regulations implementing the ban are invalid and asked for the ban to be declared unlawful.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs say they’re disappointed with the judge’s ruling. They didn’t immediately say whether they will continue pursuing the case.</p>

      <p>Raimondo says the ban is necessary to protect children.</p>
