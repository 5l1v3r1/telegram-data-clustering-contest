      <p>SAN JACINTO, Calif. (AP) - The man who allegedly pointed a gun Wednesday at a cafeteria table full of students but did not open fire at a Southern California community college was arrested at the airport as he tried to flee the country, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Greg Abejon, 25, at Los Angeles International Airport after he checked in for a flight, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported at Mount San Jacinto College southeast of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff’s Deputy Robyn Flores previously said. It was not immediately clear if Abejon was a student.</p>
      <p>Deputies were called shortly before 10 a.m. and unsuccessfully searched for the gunman on the locked-down campus. Classes were canceled for the day.</p>
      <p>There were about 500 people on campus at the time, college officials said. The lockdown was lifted at 1:30 p.m.</p>
