Kohl’s Black Friday 2019 Ad Scan And Shipping

Instantly capturing attention is the size of Kohl’s Black Friday ad. At 64-pages, it’s a monster with a massive range of deals. Less impressive, however, is the shipping policy with the store requiring a $50 minimum spend for free delivery. That said, almost all the top deals will require you to spend more than $50.

Some of Kohl’s best deals are already live. These are my top picks:

LG 55-Inch 4K HDR Smart OLED TV with AI ThinQ (55C9PUA) - $1,499.99 (save $1,000) + $300 Kohl’s Cash - shop deal now (this will be one of the best Black Friday TV deals this year)

Nintendo Switch + case and controller charging doc bundle - $319 (save $30) + $90 in Kohl’s Cash (minimal saving but Kohl’s Cash makes it sing)
PS4 Slim 1TB Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle - $199 (save $100) + $60 in Kohl’s Cash (rivals will match the price but Kohl’s Cash will differentiate)

Kohl's Black Friday deals are some of the best availableKohl's


Amazon Black Friday 2019: Here Are The First DealsForbes Gordon Kelly

Once again Kohl’s is really standing out from its rivals thanks to Kohl’s Cash. As such it is likely to have the top Xbox, Switch, PS4 Slim, Google Nest and Beats Black Friday deals this year. Kohl’s will also beat Amazon’s best deals on its own products when Kohl’s Cash is involved. 
The only disappointing omissions the lack of a PS4 Pro deal (perhaps it will come for Cyber Monday) and any further TV offers, though this shows Kohl’s current live sales are the real deal right now.
