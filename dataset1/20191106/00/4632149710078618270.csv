Her home production Bhairadevi and Damayanthi are both supernatural thrillers. In the meantime, Ravichandran has had an stroke of inspiration. He has written a script in 90 minutes flat and is readying to direct his son. Yes, the script was written in only 90 minutes. But the idea of such a film was developing in his mind for sometime. On October 18, which happens to be his daughter's birthday, he found the moment of inspiration and wrote the script in one go. The film will have no dialogues. There will be songs, plenty of them. The veteran wants to recreate the musical magic of Premaloka, his 1986 directorial. Ravichandran is currently directing Ravi Bopanna and acting in Rajendra Ponappa. He needs the call-sheet of his actors for six months at a stretch for the musical he is planning. It can happen once his completes his current commitments.
