      <p>While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) reacted to calls to reveal the whistleblower’s identity by stating that whistleblowers, especially those speaking about government action, “should be allowed to remain confidential.”</p>
      <p>Romney said, “My own view is that whistleblowers, particularly those that are blowing whistles on action within the government, should be allowed to remain confidential.”</p>
      <p>He also stated, “So, going after the whistleblower, I think, is misdirected.”</p>
