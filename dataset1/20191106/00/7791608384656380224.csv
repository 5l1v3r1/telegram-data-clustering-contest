‘The Little Mermaid: Live’ Has TV Audience Repulsed By Fishy ‘Flounder’ Design
06 Nov 2019 by Thanussha Priyah
The Little Mermaid: Live television special has just been telecasted on ABC, but many Disney fans have been divided about the whole production. The musical special included a lineup of star-studded cast including Moana’s Auli'i Cravalho as mermaid Ariel, alongside Graham Phillips as Prince Eric, Shaggy as Sebastian the crab and Queen Latifah as iconic villain Ursula. Viewers were impressed by Queen Latifah’s portrayal of Ursula, while others were disappointed with the depiction of Ariel’s shelled sidekick, Sebastian. Played by musician Shaggy, the character appeared on stage in a half-baked costume that lacked claws—he was supposed to be a crab, after all—while members of the audience had pincers on. The ultimate comedic relief, though, came through an unexpected character: Flounder. The horror of seeing Ariel’s underwater fish friend being played by a subpar puppet had the internet in stitches. Unsurprisingly, Twitter users were quick to turn the character’s design into a meme. Check out some of the best jokes about the pitiful Flounder below.
