      <h1>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Released for Linux</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T00:45:20+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 00:45</time> by <a rel="author">By Joey Sneddon</a></address>
      <p><b>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is now available on Linux and macOS</b>.</p>
      <p>The third entry in the rebooted Tomb Raider ‘origins’ series, <i>Shadow</i> pits Lara Croft against the “impenetrable jungles of Central America”, sees her explore underwater environments, and take on a rogue paramilitary organisation known as Trinity.</p>
      <p>The Linux and macOS ports of the game, which received fairly decent reviews on its console debut, is handled by Feral Interactive.</p>
      <p>But rather than just port the base game and leave it at that, they’ve brought over all <i>Shadow’s</i> extras, upgrades and downloadable content too:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The Forge</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Pillar</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Nightmare</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Price of Survival</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Serpent’s Heart</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Grand Caiman </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Path Home</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The inclusion of all that makes this definitive edition of Shadow of the Tomb Raider exactly that: definitive!</p>
      <p>System requirements for Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on Linux aren’t as restrictive as I’d have assumed either, and asks for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A</b> <b>Vulkan-supported AMD GPU w/ Mesa 19.0+ or</b></li>
        <li><b>A</b> <b>Vulkan-supported NVIDIA GPU w/ driver 418.56+</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>3.40GHz CPU</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>8GB RAM (16GB recommended)</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game itself is available to purchase via Steam or direct <a href="https://store.feralinteractive.com/xx/mac-linux-games/shadowofthetombraider/">from the Feral Store</a> (purchases can be redeemed on Steam).</p>
      <p>A Linux or macOS copy of <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> <i>Definitive Edition</i> costs £44.99/$59.99 (at RRP; future sales and offers may take it lower).</p>
