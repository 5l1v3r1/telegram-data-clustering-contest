      <p><i>Image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/pilot-copilot-commercial-plane-cockpit-operation-503467933">Shutterstock</a></i> <br/><b>A pilot in China</b> is permanently banned from flying after a photo showing a woman he let into the cockpit went viral. <br/><b>The image,</b> which reveals a female passenger lounging in the captain’s seat and posing with a peace sign, came with the caption, “Thanks to the captain. So happy,” and was repeatedly shared on Chinese social media platform Weibo. <br/><b>The image was reportedly</b> taken on 4 January on an Air Guilin flight. The widely-shared snap has resulted in the airline issuing a flying ban to the anonymous pilot who had approved of her entry into the cockpit. <br/><b>According to the airline,</b> the pilot violated air safety regulations of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for bringing an “unauthorized person” into the cockpit. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Aviation experts</b> told Chinese newspaper <i><a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1168885.shtml?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Global Times</a></i> that the photo must have been taken mid-flight from Guilin to Yangzhou. Other crew members believed to have been involved in the situation have also been suspended, and investigations are still ongoing. <br/><b>In a statement,</b> Air Guilin said that “passengers’ safety is a top priority,” and the company takes a “zero-tolerance approach” towards any “inappropriate and unprofessional behavior” that might be detrimental to the safety of its flights.</p>
