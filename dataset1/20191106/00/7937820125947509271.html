      <p>Invasion by non-native grasses sharply increases fire risk in a variety of ecosystems across the continental United States, from deciduous forest in the east to the deserts of the southwest.</p>
      <p>Emily Fusco at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and her colleagues used government records, satellite fire data and computer models to analyse the impact of 12 species of non-native grasses on fire trends in 29 US ecological regions. The researchers then compared these patterns in invaded and uninvaded landscapes.</p>
      <p>The results showed that fire had burned more of a habitat riddled with one of eight weed species than the same type of habitat without the invader. For example, flames had torched 2.3 times as much dry shrubland invaded by <i>Schismus barbatus</i> grass than dry shrubland free of this species. Of the eight fire-promoting weeds, six increased fire frequency in the ecosystems that they had invaded.</p>
      <p>The authors suggest that the presence of invasive grasses should be considered more prominently in future land-management plans.</p>
