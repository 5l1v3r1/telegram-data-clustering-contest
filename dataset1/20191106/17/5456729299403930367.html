      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:29:42+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/361329-five-students-died-in-kogi-varsity-killings-police.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The police in Lokoja on Wednesday said five students and not 13 students, as earlier reported, were killed at the Kogi State University, Ayangba.</p>
      <p>The command’s Public Relations Officer made the clarification in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>Mr Aya, in a statement, listed the casualties to include Justice Keke, a 300-level student of Physics Department who was killed in the campus after a theatre production on November 1.</p>
      <p>He also said that a yet to be identified corpse was found in an uncompleted building behind the university on November 2.</p>
      <p>The police spokesman said Abdrulraman Usman, a 200-level student of History Department was killed at his father’s lodge on November 3.</p>
      <p>“On November 3, two corpses, identified as that of Oloruntoba Godwin, a 400 level student of Geo/Planning Department and Ajileye Richard, a 200 level Accounting student, were seen inside the bush behind Harbor Bay Hotel.</p>
      <p>“These give a total of five persons killed and not 13 as reported by a section of the media,” Mr Aya said.</p>
      <p>He said that the state Commissioner of Police, Akeem Busari, had urged the citizens to disregard the misleading reports and be focussed on how to ensure a lasting peace.</p>
      <p>Mr Busari also assured the people of the police’s readiness to provide a secured environment for all eligible voters to exercise their franchise without fear of intimidation and molestation during the November 16 governorship elections.</p>
      <p>He also promised to deal decisively with any political thug or hoodlum who might want to disrupt the electoral process.</p>
