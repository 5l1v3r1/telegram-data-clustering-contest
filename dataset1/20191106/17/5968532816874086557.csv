Supercell’s Rush Wars closes its doors after only a couple months (Update)

06 Nov 2019, 17:08




Update, November 6, 2019 (12:05 AM ET): After only a couple of months, Supercell is officially closing Rush Wars November 30. According to Supercell, the development team ran into a few roadblocks in determining the future of the game and inevitably decided it was impossible to make it as good as the team hoped.
Here at Supercell, we have extraordinarily high standards for our games. We want to be sure that each game we release will be played for years and remembered forever. Unfortunately, we felt that even if we continued working on Rush Wars, we wouldn’t hit this goal.
In-app purchases have already been disabled, and Rush Wars players have until the end of the month to play the game. At least the company’s other hits like Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, and Boom Beach are still going strong. 
Original article: Less than a year after the release of Brawl Stars, Supercell has released yet another multiplayer strategy game for Android and iOS devices. Rush Wars takes familiar elements from Supercell’s other hit games like Clash of Clans and Boom Beach and combines them in a new way.
For now, Rush Wars has only soft-launched in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Click the link below to download the game now in those regions, or try out it out with a VPN. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about the game, and stay tuned to Android Authority for the latest Rush Wars news, tips, tricks, and guides!

What is Rush Wars?
Rush Wars is a new strategy multiplayer game from Supercell. You create a base and and attack other players’ bases to steal their gold. The looted gold is then used to improve your defenses and troops.
What is the Rush Wars release date?
Rush Wars was soft-launched on August 26 in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. A global release date has not been announced, but hopefully the period between soft launch and general availability is shorter than Brawl Stars’ (16 months).
What is Rush Wars gameplay like?



The gameplay is best described as a mix of Clash of Clans and Boom Beach. You have a base which you must defend with a combination of static defenses and troops. You can also attack other players’ bases with troops, commanders, and spells.
Check out Supercell-focused YouTuber Chief Pat’s video above for more Rush Wars gameplay details, but keep in mind the game is still in beta and might change over time.
Is Rush Wars free-to-play?
Yes, like all of Supercell’s games Rush Wars is free-to-play.
Will Rush Wars survive soft launch?
Supercell isn’t shy about cancelling games that it feels aren’t up to snuff, even after soft launching. If Rush Wars doesn’t live up to expectations, it may never see a global launch. It could be months or even years before the company feels the title is ready, but stay tuned for more info in the coming months.
That’s everything we know so far about Rush Wars. Are you excited about Supercell’s latest release? Let us know in the comments below!
