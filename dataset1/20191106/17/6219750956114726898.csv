With a rectangular plant separated by a central corridor where vertical circulations are concentrated such as: stairs, elevator and forklifts. The building is unrestricted from its subsequent adjoining to generate terraces to an interior garden and double view for shops, which have prominent terraces to appreciate the different views.
