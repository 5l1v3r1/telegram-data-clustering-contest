      <p>(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) plans to unveil its electric pickup truck, "cybertruck," on Nov. 21 in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1192113294036754432">here</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Musk had said in January that Tesla might be ready to unveil the truck by summer.</p>
      <p>"Cybertruck doesn't look like anything I've seen bouncing around the Internet. It's closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future," Musk had said in a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1183583315263131648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1183583315263131648&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F10%2F15%2Felon-musk-says-tesla-building-armored-personnel-carrier-future-10920019%2F">here</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Carmakers including Ford Motor Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/F.N">F.N</a>) and General Motors Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N">GM.N</a>) are racing to design radical new takes on their most profitable pickup truck models, replacing petroleum-fueled engines with batteries in a bid to outflank Tesla’s plan to eclipse their brands.</p>
      <p>Ford’s F-150 pickup and GM’s Chevrolet Silverado are the top selling vehicles in the U.S. market.</p>
      <p>The reveal would happen a day before the Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public, according to its website https://laautoshow.com.</p>
