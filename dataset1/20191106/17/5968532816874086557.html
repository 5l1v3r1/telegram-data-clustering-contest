      <p><b>Update, November 6, 2019 (12:05 AM ET):</b> After only a couple of months, Supercell is <a href="https://supercell.com/en/news/rush-wars-closing/7225/">officially closing</a> Rush Wars November 30. According to Supercell, the development team ran into a few roadblocks in determining the future of the game and inevitably decided it was impossible to make it as good as the team hoped.</p>
      <blockquote>Here at Supercell, we have extraordinarily high standards for our games. We want to be sure that each game we release will be played for years and remembered forever. Unfortunately, we felt that even if we continued working on Rush Wars, we wouldn’t hit this goal.</blockquote>
      <p>In-app purchases have already been disabled, and Rush Wars players have until the end of the month to play the game. At least the company’s other hits like Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, and Boom Beach are still going strong. </p>

      <h3>Will Rush Wars survive soft launch?</h3>
      <p>Supercell isn’t shy about cancelling games that it feels aren’t up to snuff, even after soft launching. If Rush Wars doesn’t live up to expectations, it may never see a global launch.
