“I am back with a bang, every Saturday we will be on Kameme TV and Kameme FM. I want to thank the management at Mediamax for listening to our listeners. It is not always about money, but more about supporting our communities,” he announced on Wednesday.
The sacking of the Mediamax employees has elicited different opinions, with another victim of the layoff, Moses Kanyira asking for intervention from President Uhuru Kenyatta who partly owns the company to have his job back.
