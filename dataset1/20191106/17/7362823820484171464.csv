“The levels of methamphetamine in this baby’s system were such high levels, even for an adult, so we believe she was using almost the whole entire time she was pregnant,” Vallin said of Becker's recent stillborn child. He said she admitted to using meth days before the child was delivered stillborn.
Becker's aunt said the 25-year-old is still close to her 1-year-old son, and urged her niece Tuesday ""to turn herself in"" if she wanted to see him.
