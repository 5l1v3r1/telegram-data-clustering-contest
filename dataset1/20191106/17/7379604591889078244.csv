BORIS Johnson launched his election campaign for the December 12 vote after meeting with the Queen today.

But the PM suffered a massive blow on the first day of his election campaign after  Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns quit over a row about a collapsed rape trial.


































Alex Matthews2 hours agoNovember 6, 2019HOW WORKINGTON WENT Workington, in Cumbria, has become a battleground seat after the Tory party identified the 'Workington man' as the voter they wanted to steal from Labour. Today Nigel Farage also visited the Leave-voting constituency as he planned to hoover up Labour Brexiteers from Jeremy Corbyn. But how did the area vote in the EU referendum and 2017 election? Our handy graphic shows you how.
Natasha Clark3 hours agoNovember 6, 2019WALKER WALKS ON IN… Nigel Farage is snapped today with local party candidate David Walker in Workington. Interesting as the party have actually booted out the old candidate, Philip Walling. The party claims it was for “doing no work” but he asked for aid from the national party to try and win the seat, and was refused. But yesterday Mr Walling tweeted out his backing for Boris and getting Brexit done. He said he agreed with a tweet which said a vote for Mr Farage is a vote for Corbyn. Awkward.. The party say this was AFTER they had dropped him, though. Not a great look to switch your candidate on the day Nigel is in town.

Happy to report that Nicola Sturgeon is thinking no such silly thoughts – here she is enjoying a Scotland-branded cup cake.

Mr Johnson threw up a two-fingered salute as he gave a speech to reporters – emulating the iconic gesture of Britain’s greatest ever wartime PM. But will Boris walk in Churchill’s foot steps further by winning an election?
