      <h1>Guy Uses Dead Grandad Chat-Up Line To Slide Into Girl’s DMs And She Was Not Impressed</h1>

        <b>Throughout the centuries, love – or at least the sensation of fancying someone a bit – has been expressed through a myriad of unusual – and sometimes downright odd – practices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>From giving your crush apples soaked in your own sweat (yes, really) to handing them a wooden spoon when you want to get frisky, history informs us there really is no weirdness limit when it comes to humans being guided by their downstairs brain.</p>
      <p>However, one young man could well have just attempted the most flabbergastingly terrible attempt at human courtship of all time; expertly managing to convey a morbid disrespect for the dead with a woeful lack of self-awareness.</p>

      <p>You wouldn’t think it needs to be said that you should always make sure to leave your dead grandad firmly outside of your efforts to slide into a person’s DMs. However, this Dating 101 tip doesn’t appear to have reached all ears.</p>
      <p>23-year-old Rachel Brogan was left quite surprised when, one fine evening, she received a DM from a stranger enquiring, ‘Hey did you hear about my granddad x’.</p>
      <p>Puzzled, the Scotland-based NHS clerical officer simply – and understandably – replied, ‘what?’. It’s at this point the messenger’s intentions became all too clear.</p>

        <b>Appearing to feign a grief-addled mix up, the DM Romeo explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Sh*t sorry wrong person meant to txt a girl a went to school with but clicked on you by accident. Not thinking straight as my grandad passed away sorry x</blockquote>
      <p>Had he left it there, Rachel could well have believed his story. However, the would-be smooth guy made the grave error of believing her to have been born yesterday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Devastation apparently forgotten, the messenger proceeded to purr:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>You are lovely tho x [smiley face emoji] You single? x</blockquote>
      <p>Not having any of it, Rachel wisely chose not to reply and instead shared a screenshot of the ghoulish flirtation on Twitter, where it has been liked well over 30,000 times.</p>

        <b>One person grimaced:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Translation….<br/><br/>Hello me Grandads dead, fancy a shag to cheer me up?</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Another empathised:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I once had a guy tell me he had cancer as an opener for my dms never met him before, didn’t know who he was either.</blockquote>

      <p>Bizarrely, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened to poor Rachel, who has since admitted to having had ‘quite a few ones like that’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rachel – who usually prefers to meet people in real life or through dating apps – has said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I think it was just a weird way to get my attention, […] I don’t think he meant to click someone else at all, ha ha ha.</blockquote>
      <p>Better luck next time pal…</p>
