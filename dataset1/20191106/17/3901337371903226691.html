      <p>Besides football being his main source of income, the 30-year-old specializes in game farming and often shares the activities of his Free State-based farm with his social media followers.</p>
      <p>Pigs, sheep and cattle feature amongst the Bloemfontein-born star’s game.</p>
      <p>He manages to infuse his farm life with modern day living as he often rocks up to the farm in his silky Mercedes-Benz.</p>
