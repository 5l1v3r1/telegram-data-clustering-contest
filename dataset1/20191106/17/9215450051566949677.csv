中手游上市後的部署
中手游（302）以招股範圍上限2.83元定價，首日表現未算標青，上市首日僅升2%，惟週一高見4.49元，收市大升22.4%至4.26元，較上市價累計升5成。不過，週二逆市見回套，收市回調9.2%至3.87元，仍較上市價高37%。內地發新一批國產遊戲版號，有22個遊戲獲批，其中，中手游的《歡樂炮擊》獲得版號。
不過，國家新聞出版署最新發布《關於防止未成年人沉迷網絡遊戲的通知》，正式公布推行六方面舉措，以加強管控未成年人使用網絡遊戲，當中包括嚴格實名註冊、嚴格控制未成年人使用網絡遊戲時段時長、同一網絡遊戲企業所提供的遊戲付費服務，8周歲以上未滿16歲的未成年人用戶，單次充值金額不得超過50元（人民幣，下同），每月充值金額累計不得超過200元等。
中手游曾經在納斯達克掛牌，2015年8月透過私有化退市。2018年度，集團自持續經營業務的收益15.96億元，按年增加57.6%，純利升1.2%至3.15億元。至於2019年上半年，自持續經營業務的收益15.29億元，按年上升1.3倍，純利升60.1%至2.6億元。遊戲發行為主要收入來源，2019年上半年分數入升1.1倍至13.07億元，佔總收入的85.5%。
今年上半年，平均每月付費用按年增加68.1%至101.7萬名；每名付費用戶每月平均收益（ARPPU）由2018年的170.1元，上升至2019年上半年的250.6元。中手游目前持有超過31項IP授權，並擁有68項自有IP，包括「仙劍奇俠傳」、「海賊王」、「龍珠Z」和「火影忍者」等，有關IP已具有一定知名度，擁有龐大粉絲群。
為了擴大集團獲取IP的渠道，集團目前在12家手遊開發公司中持有股權，亦收購兩家遊戲開發商–北京軟星51%股權，以及文脈互動100%股權，兩者均成功開發及推出IP手遊。集團已目物色29款遊戲，並有機會於2020年年底前推出，支持中長線的發展。新股上市初期，以投機為主導，股價波動較大，只宜小注買入，並嚴守止蝕價。
