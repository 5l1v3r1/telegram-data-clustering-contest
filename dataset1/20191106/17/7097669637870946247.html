      <h1>Yoga teacher barred from using church hall as practice not 'compatible' with Christianity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:46:18+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/11-common-misconceptions-yoga-teachers-want-know/"> yoga teacher</a> has been barred from using a church hall for her classes after a clergyman claimed the practice was not "compatible" with Christianity.</p>
      <p>Atsuko Kato, 54, has run sessions at a range of venues for 25 years, building up a client base across Devon.</p>
      <p>But when she looked for new venues to host classes in Barnstaple she was rejected from hiring a church hall in the village of Pilton due to religious reasons. </p>
      <p>Reverend Nigel Dilkes said St Mary's Church could not accommodate Ms Kato because the activity was not "compatible with the Christian faith".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/10-essential-yoga-poses-beginners/">Yoga originated in northern India</a> and has connections to both Hinduism and Buddhism. Ms Kato said the reverend's stance was "outdated", and pointed out that a female vicar was among her students.</p>
      <p>She said: "They asked me what I wanted to hire it for and I said to teach a yoga class.</p>
      <p>"They said they can not tolerate it if it was for yoga and claimed yoga was not suitable for a church.</p>
      <p>"They said they weren't allowed to host yoga classes because they were a church and it was not compatible with Christian beliefs. No other explanation, that was it.</p>
      <p>"In one of my classes I have a female vicar and they don't seem to have concerns, so I struggle to understand what the problem is.</p>
      <p>"I was very surprised by this attitude, yoga is so mainstream now."</p>
      <p>Reverend Dilkes said the church hall was solely to be used for activities deemed compatible with the Christian faith, and encouraged pilates to be practiced as an alternative.</p>
      <p>He said: "The test of this is whether a belief or world view underpinning the activity acknowledges that there is only one God and that the New Testament person of Jesus Christ is God himself.</p>
      <p>"Yoga is one of several activities that claims to confer physical benefits for flexibility and balance but also claims a spiritual connection which doesn't stand this test.</p>
      <p>"So we say why not enjoy, for example, pilates instead. We would welcome pilates classes to our church hall."</p>
