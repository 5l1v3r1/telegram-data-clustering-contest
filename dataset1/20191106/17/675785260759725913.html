      <h1>Arsenal player ratings from Vitoria draw as Kieran Tierney catches the eye in drab affair</h1>
      <h2>The Scottish international was a rare bright spark for Unai Emery's men after yet another disappointing result</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:48:52+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal were denied victory in stoppage time of their Europa League clash in Portugal against Vitoria.</p>
      <p>Shkodran Mustafi thought he had sealed the three points for the Gunners as he headed home in the second half but Bruno Duarte's late acrobatic effort meant the shares were spoiled.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> finally made the breakthrough which the game so badly needed with nine minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Pepe curled in an inviting cross from a set-piece which found Germany international unmarked from six yards from goal to head home.</p>
      <p>But the celebrations were short-lived as Duarte found the net - and Vitoria twice went close to snatching victory in the remaining moments.</p>
      <p>Here's how Arsenal rated in Guimaraes...</p>
