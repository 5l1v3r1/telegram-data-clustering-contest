      <h1>States say they'll keep lawsuits against Purdue on hold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:26:55+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>State attorneys general with pending lawsuits against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its owners are asking a federal bankruptcy judge to give them more time to continue negotiating.</p>
      <p>A temporary freeze on their lawsuits expires this week. On Wednesday, the judge is to decide whether to halt them or issue another temporary stay that could last for months.</p>
      <p>In a filing earlier this week, about two dozen attorneys general said they are making progress in their talks with Purdue over the nation's opioid crisis and want a six-week extension.</p>
      <p>The states, along with the District of Columbia, opposed a tentative settlement the company reached in September with two dozen other states and many of the local governments suing it. Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection as part of that deal.</p>
