Famitsu's Japanese chart figures are now in for 28th October - 3rd November, revealing that Luigi's Mansion 3 couldn't quite make it to the top spot.
The game sold more than 150,000 copies in its opening week, but even that total couldn't defeat Persona 5 Royal which claimed just over 200,000 sales on PS4. Ring Fit Adventure is still performing nicely, too, managing to stay close to the top in third position, and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 has debuted in fifth.
Here are the top 10 (first numbers are this week's estimated sales, followed by total sales):

1) [PS4] Persona 5 Royal (Atlus) {2019.10.31} - 201.448 / NEW2) [NSW] Luigi's Mansion 3 (Nintendo) {2019.10.31} - 150.649 / NEW3) [NSW] Ring Fit Adventure (Nintendo) {2019.10.18} - 51.143 / 183.6854) [PS4] Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Sony Interactive Entertainment) {2019.10.25} - 37.905 / 155.5755) [NSW] Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (Sega) {2019.11.01} - 19.438 / NEW6) [NSW] Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition (Square Enix) {2019.09.27} - 8.551 / 421.5487) [NSW] Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town (Marvelous) {2019.10.17} - 8.266 / 90.9548) [NSW] Minecraft (Microsoft Game Studios) {2018.06.21} - 7.758 / 987.2029) [NSW] Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo) {2017.04.28} - 7.233 / 2.511.66210) [NSW] Super Smash Bros.
