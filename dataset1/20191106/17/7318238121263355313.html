      <p>Extinction Rebellion climate-change activists won a legal challenge on Wednesday (November 6) against a police-imposed blanket ban on protests during its "Autumn Uprising" in London.</p>
      <p>Britain's High Court said separate gatherings, even if co-ordinated by one organization, could not be defined as a single "public assembly" and the officer who set the ban was not present at the scene.</p>
      <p>Therefore a ban on any Extinction Rebellion in London other than at Trafalgar Square was unlawful and would be quashed, it said.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion blocked roads, targeted financial institutions, sprayed paint on the government's Treasury and disrupted transport during two weeks of direct action.</p>
      <p>Ellie Chowns, a Green member of the European Parliament who was arrested while the ban was in place, said the ruling defended the right to peaceful assembly and public protest.</p>
      <p>London's Metropolitan Police Service said it was disappointed by the judgement. The police said 1,828 people were arrested in 10 days of protest, with 165 charged by November 6.</p>
