      <p>French actress Catherine Deneuve has been hospitalised in Paris after suffering a stroke, her family told AFP.</p>
      <p>The 76-year-old star had “a very limited ischemic stroke” which is reversible, according to a statement released through her agent, Claire Blondel.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately, she has no loss of movement and must of course take some time off," said the statement, without giving further details.</p>
      <p>The actress has been in Paris since October filming Emanuelle Bercot’s latest film, “De Son Vivant”, in which she stars alongside Benoît Magimel.</p>
