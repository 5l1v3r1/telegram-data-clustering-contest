泰國減息！泰銖應聲即跌！泰國央行公布，政策委員決定減息0.25厘，以支持經濟，指標利率減至1.25厘，重返全球金融危機時創下的最低水平。落實減息後，泰銖兌每美元報30.4，為10月中以來最低。咁究竟去泰國旅行邊度兌泰銖最抵？

泰國減息抑制泰銖升值
今次是央行今年以來第2次減息，不過，貨幣政策委員會對減息決定看法有分歧，5名委員贊成，2名委員則支持維持政策不變。泰國央行表示，將放寬資本外流限制，以抑制泰銖升值，擔憂貨幣升值很大程度會影響經濟發展。至於未來貨幣政策將視乎數據而定。
中投傲揚精選基金基金經理溫鋼城表示，全球央行減息，加上泰國GDP稍為由2.8%，回落至2.3%，再減息屬正常。對於泰銖將會跌到咩價位，他指每1美元兌31泰銖 （約1港元兌3.96泰銖）有很好支持。
另外，艾德證券期貨總經理陳健豪亦認為，今次泰國減息是跟隨全球減息及泰國經濟低迷。他表示，泰銖由年初至今已有近7%的升幅，作為出口為主國家，泰銖強勢嚴重打擊經濟，無論消費或投資者都變得保守。對於準備兌換泰銖前往泰國旅遊的人，他認為現時不是一個好時機，因為減息後泰銖仍屬強勢貨幣。陳健豪表示，每1美元兌31泰銖 （約1港元兌3.96泰銖）將會是好淡分界線，要兌泰銖的話可以此價作參考。
泰國旅行邊度兌泰銖最抵？
除日本外，泰國也是香港人熱門旅遊聖地，所以邊度兌泰銖抵，大家都好關心。咁究竟邊度兌最抵？百年？發達鳥？堅成？在機場櫃員機用銀聯卡提現金？通通都不是，答案在泰國當地的一間找換店Super Rich。
從Superrich網站可見，截至2019年11月6日下午五時，每1港元兌3.86泰銖。
至於香港三間銀行包括中銀香港、恒生和滙豐的兌換率是介乎每1港元兌3.64至3.75泰銖，Super Rich比銀行足足平3%至6%。至於兩間同被譽為「香港最抵兌換率」的兌換店百年及堅成都被比下去，兩找換店現為每1港元兌3.81泰銖及每1港元兌3.80泰銖，Super Rich仍平近1.31%。

恒生：每1港元兌3.75泰銖
滙豐：每1港元兌3.64泰銖
中銀香港：每1港元兌3.70泰銖
百年找換店：每1港元兌3.81泰銖
堅成找換店：每1港元兌3.80泰銖




＊以上兌換價只供參考，一切以相關機構最終決定為準。
不過，如果你到當地機場，會發現兌換差價更大。綠色Superrich或綠標Superrich，相信經常遊泰的香港人都不會陌生，匯率亦是眾多Superrich中最便宜，12間分店分別坐落於BTS/MRT沿線及大型商場附近，通常以本店Headquarter Rajdamri1的匯率較高，當然亦要視乎當天匯率。



另外，橙色Super Rich找換店位置較為隱蔽，因為一出機場，先看到的兌換貨幣窗口都是泰國盤谷銀行(Bangkok Bank) 、泰華農民銀行(Kasikorn bank)等等，而Super Rich其實是位於地庫。當大家檢查完護照通關並領取行李後，是在二樓的入境大廳出來。這時大家需搭乘電梯落兩層，到B1 的機場快線Airport Link樓層。
在搭乘機場快線的紅色直達車Express Line售票口(照片中正前方靠左邊位置)，就會看到一個橙色的兌換亭，那就是Super Rich了。由出禁區到此的距離，大約3分鐘左右，但匯率就便宜兩成，極度划算。不過要留意，Super Rich 的營業時間為每日上午10時至晚上8時，搭早機或通宵機的朋友，便要想想在香港兌定到泰銖了。另外，Super Rich規定每筆交易金額不得小於等值1,000泰銖，以及必須要出示護照才能兌換。
若然真的晚上8時後才抵達機場，也可考慮在Super Rich的頭號對手 Value Plus Currency Exchange，它同樣位於Super Rich的B1層，在Express Line電扶梯的另一邊，其營業時間為每日上午6時至晚上12時，據聞匯率同Super Rich不相伯仲。其實在市區一樣有Super Rich，在四面佛附近的Big C超市對面正正有一家。趕不及在機場兌換，也可考慮在市區兌換。

Thailand's interest rate cuts fell! Going to Thailand for a trip, etc.
06 Nov 2019, 17:30 by Finance
Thailand cut interest rates! The Thai baht fell silently! The Bank of Thailand announced that the policy committee decided to cut interest rates by 0.25% to support the economy, and the benchmark interest rate was reduced to 1.25%, returning to the lowest level set in the global financial crisis. After the implementation of the interest rate cut, the Thai baht was reported at 30.4 per dollar, the lowest since mid-October. What is the best way to go to Thailand to travel to Thailand?

Thailand's interest rate cuts inhibit Thai baht appreciation
This time, the central bank cut interest rates for the second time this year. However, the Monetary Policy Committee has different views on the decision to cut interest rates. Five members agreed, and two members supported the policy. The Bank of Thailand said it would ease the capital outflow restrictions to curb the appreciation of the Thai baht, fearing that currency appreciation will affect economic development to a large extent. As for the future monetary policy will depend on the data.
Wengang said that the global central bank cut interest rates, and Thailand's GDP fell slightly from 2.8% to 2.3%, and then the interest rate cut is normal. For the Thai baht will fall to the price level, he said that every 1 US dollar against 31 baht (about 1 Hong Kong dollar to 3.96 baht) is very supportive.
In addition, Chen Jianhao, General Manager of Aide Securities Futures, also believes that this interest rate cut in Thailand is following the global interest rate cut and the economic downturn in Thailand. He said that the Thai baht has increased by nearly 7% since the beginning of the year. As an export-oriented country, the Thai baht has been a strong hit on the economy, and both consumers and investors have become conservative. For those who are preparing to redeem the Thai baht for travel to Thailand, he thinks that it is not a good time because the Thai baht is still a strong currency after the interest rate cut. Chen Jianhao said that every 1 US dollar against 31 baht (about 1 Hong Kong dollar to 3.96 baht) would be a good demarcation line. If you want to pay against the Thai baht, you can use this price as a reference.
Thailand travels the best against the Thai baht?
In addition to Japan, Thailand is also a popular tourist destination for Hong Kong people, so we have to pay attention to it. Everyone cares. What is the best match? century? Developed birds? Jiancheng? At the airport teller machine, I use the UnionPay card to raise cash? None of them are the answer. The answer is Super Rich, a local shop in Thailand.
As can be seen from the Superrich website, as of 5 pm on November 6, 2019, every baht is 3.86 baht.
As for the exchange rates of the three banks in Hong Kong including BOCHK, Hang Seng and HSBC, the exchange rate is between 3.64 and 3.75 baht per 1 Hong Kong dollar. Super Rich is 3% to 6% more than the bank. As for the two exchange shops that have been hailed as ""Hong Kong's most exchange rate"", the two stores are now compared with 3.81 baht per 1 Hong Kong dollar and 3.80 baht per 1 Hong Kong dollar. Super Rich is still close. 1.31%.

Hang Seng: THB 3.75 per 1 Hong Kong Dollar
HSBC: THB 3.64 per 1 Hong Kong Dollar
BOC Hong Kong: THB 3.70 per 1 Hong Kong Dollar
100-year change shop: HK$3.81 per 1 Hong Kong dollar
Jiancheng change shop: THB 3.80 per 1 Hong Kong dollar




*The above conversion price is for reference only, and all decisions are subject to the final decision of the relevant institution.
However, if you go to the local airport, you will find that the exchange difference is even greater. Green Superrich or Green Superrich, I believe that Hong Kong people who travel to Thailand are not unfamiliar. The exchange rate is also the cheapest among the many Superrich. The 12 branches are located near the BTS/MRT and large shopping malls, usually at the exchange rate of our headquarters Headquarter Rajdamri1. Higher, of course, depends on the exchange rate of the day.



In addition, the location of the orange Super Rich change shop is more hidden, because the first time you see the exchange currency window is the Bangkok Bank, the Thai peasant bank (Kasikorn bank), etc., and Super Rich actually Is located in the basement. When everyone checked the passport and collected the baggage, they came out at the arrival hall on the second floor. At this time, everyone needs to take the elevator to the second floor and go to the Airport Link floor of B1's Airport Express.
On the red express train Express Line ticket at the Airport Express (left in front of the photo), you will see an orange exchange booth, which is Super Rich. The distance from the restricted area to this is about 3 minutes, but the exchange rate is 20% cheaper and extremely cost-effective. However, it should be noted that Super Rich's business hours are from 10 am to 8 pm daily. Friends who take an early morning or overnight machine must think about the Thai baht in Hong Kong. In addition, Super Rich stipulates that each transaction amount must not be less than the equivalent of 1,000 baht, and must be presented with a passport to be redeemed.
If you really arrive at the airport after 8 pm, consider Super Rich's number one opponent Value Plus Currency Exchange, which is also located on the B1 floor of Super Rich, on the other side of the Express Line escalator, which is open daily. From 6 am to 12 pm, it is reported that the exchange rate is not the same as Super Rich. In fact, there is Super Rich in the urban area, and there is one opposite the Big C supermarket near the Erawan. Can't catch up at the airport, you can also consider redeeming in the city.
