      <h1>Junior Cup draw in full as Auchinleck Talbot are handed Rossvale away tie</h1>
      <h2>The competition holders take on their Premiership rivals with former Talbot hero David Gormley in charge of the New Tinto Park club.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:15:28+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/auchinleck-talbot">Auchinleck Talbot</a> hero David Gormley is on collision course with his old club in the fourth round of the Junior Cup.</p>
      <p>The new Rossvale manager - who has won his first six matches in charge of the Premiership outfit - saw his side paired with the holders and favourites in Wednesday's draw.</p>
      <p>Gormley hit the winner for Talbot when they lifted the trophy in 2013 beating <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/linlithgow-rose">Linlithgow</a> Rose 1-0.</p>
      <p>Talbot will head to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> for the tie of the round while, elsewhere, 2016 winners Beith face a long trip north to face Aberdeen East End and giantkillers Kirriemuir, who beat last yearâ€™s finalists Largs in the 3rd round, take on Tayport at home.</p>
