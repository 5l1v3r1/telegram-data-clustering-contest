      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:11:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Jamiat Ulema-e Islam Fazl (JUI-F) leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidri has rejected the offer of PM Imran Khan saying he (PM) should keep his offer in his pocket.</p>
      <p>Addressing to media after JUI-F’s meeting, Haidri said our workers have already made the arrangements. He said rain is a blessing of God but these rulers are a curse on people.</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning here that PM Imran Khan on Wednesday has taken notice of difficulties being faced by the protesters of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s (JUI-F) anti-government Azadi March due to rain and changing weather conditions.</p>
      <p>In a post on social-networking website Twitter, the premier has directed the chairman of Capital Development Authority (CDA) to immediately visit the area and provide all the facilities to the protesters, who are holding sit-in on Kashmir Highway in federal capital, Islamabad.</p>
      <p>JUI-F’s haidri said the March would continue till the resignation of PM Imran. He said they offered Friday prayers at the same place last week and they will also offer coming Friday prayer here.</p>
