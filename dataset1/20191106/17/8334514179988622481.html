      <p>(Reuters) - The New York Times Co (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NYT.N">NYT.N</a>) on Wednesday forecast a “fairly challenging” fourth quarter due to a drop in advertising revenue, which the publisher said may fall further due to changes in its ad platform, sending its shares down 9%.</p>

      <p>The company said it will no longer allow automated selling of ad space meant for its apps, and the 168-year old newspaper expects to lose digital advertising revenue in “single-digit millions” when it rolls out the new measure in January 2020.</p>
      <p>“... this will be more than made up by gains in engagement and a higher propensity by app users, both to subscribe and retain,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson said.</p>
      <p>The weak advertising forecast overshadowed the increase in digital subscriber numbers that rose 273,000 from the immediately preceding quarter, taking the total tally to about 4 million.</p>
      <p>Thompson added that while digital advertising performed slightly better in the third quarter, he expects a “fairly challenging” current quarter.</p>
      <p>The newspaper is grappling with an ongoing decline in advertising revenue as companies shift to Alphabet Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O">GOOGL.O</a>) Google and Facebook Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a>) that have a wider reach.</p>
      <p>New York Times said it saw a hike in the volume of news in the third quarter and expects the same to continue till 2020, an election year. It also got a boost from the “Trump bump” - the effect of U.S. President Donald Trump’s attacks on the paper as well as the Times’ coverage of his administration.</p>
      <p>The company’s costs rose in the reported quarter as it rolled out 8 new episodes of “The Weekly” television show. Operating costs increased to $401.5 million from $380.8 million.</p>
      <p>The newspaper has diversified its offerings with the popular “The Daily” podcast and “The Weekly” show countering the fall in advertising revenue from print. The podcast has more than 2 million people tuning in daily.</p>
      <p>Total revenue rose to $428.5 million from $417.3 million, marginally falling short of analysts’ average estimate of $429.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company earned 12 cents per share, above expectations of 10 cents.</p>
