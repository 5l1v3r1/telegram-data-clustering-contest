      <h1>Nepal cries foul over new India map</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T17:08:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Nepal on Wednesday objected to a new map released by India that places the disputed area of Kalapani within Delhi's borders, saying it was "clear" the territory belonged to Kathmandu.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, India released the new map following its decision to split the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two administrative territories.</p>
      <p>On the map, India's border cuts into Kalapani -- long a source of contention between the two countries, particularly because Indian troops have been deployed in the area for more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>Nepal "is committed to protecting its international border," the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Any border-related issue relating to the two friendly countries needs to be resolved through diplomatic channels on the basis of historical documents and evidence."</p>
      <p>"The Nepal government will not accept any unilateral decision," it added.</p>
      <p>An 1816 treaty established Nepal's western boundary with India along the Kali River, but border disputes have arisen over a discrepancy between the two sides over where the source of the river is located.</p>
      <p>Rajan Bhattarai, the foreign relations advisor to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said a solution would be sought through talks.</p>
      <p>"We have to verify the authenticity of the map and examine the borderline from our concerned authorities and experts. Then we will start talks using our diplomatic channels," Bhattarai told AFP.</p>
