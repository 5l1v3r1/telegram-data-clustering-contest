韓國瑜遭爆購買豪宅 韓陣營：庶民也可買賣房產

（中央社記者王承中台北6日電）週刊報導國民黨總統參選人韓國瑜失業時曾購買千萬豪宅，韓國瑜競辦發言人何庭歡今天表示，該筆房產因韓國瑜夫婦高估財務負擔能力，已在交屋前就賠本售出，庶民也有可以買賣房產的權利。
週刊報導韓國瑜在擔任北農總經理前一年，還是失業的狀況下，大手筆下訂一戶南港豪宅，總價高達新台幣7200萬元，並指出當時是由韓國瑜的太太李佳芬跟朋友組成「貴婦購屋團」下訂。除先前的農舍外，現又爆出千萬豪宅，也讓外界質疑韓國瑜的財產來源不明，是假庶民。
何庭歡上午在國民黨中央黨部接受媒體聯訪時表示，當年韓國瑜夫婦有意到台北發展，一開始選擇在內湖貸款購屋，後因孩子問題，需要更大空間，所以決定處分掉內湖的房產，再貸款購買南港的預售屋，負擔頭期款跟部分利息，可能是因為高估財務負擔的能力，所以在交屋前就賠本售出。
對於李佳芬參加貴婦購屋團，以及韓國瑜當時無業，如何購買豪宅，質疑庶民形象破裂，何庭歡指出，從來沒有聽說過李佳芬有參加貴婦團，且庶民就是指平民、沒有特權的人，庶民也擁有可以買賣房產的權利，這屬於個人財務規劃。
媒體詢問，民進黨台北市議員簡舒培質疑韓國瑜擔任北農總經理期間，曾大量進口中國產的奇異果冒充紐西蘭的奇異果。何庭歡表示，北農的財務規劃都是經過公司內部及董事會共同決議，韓國瑜擔任總經理任內，北農營運狀況、獲利，都算是幾十年來相當好的表現，希望簡舒培多關心目前的市政，不要因為抹黑跟污衊而刻意質疑。
有關副手的部分，何庭歡表示，韓國瑜強調副手是心中非常重要的一部分，也有適當的人選，一定會推出符合社會期待、民意所歸的人選，確定後會統一說明。
媒體追問，民進黨副秘書長林飛帆質疑韓國瑜的口號從無兌現。何庭歡指出，現在是競選期間，韓國瑜當然提出很多民意所歸的政策，等到當選後就會一一兌現，一直強調就是希望捍衛中華民國主權，反倒是口口聲聲要捍衛主權的民進黨，卻不斷挑釁讓兩岸關係緊張、邦交國斷交，且只在選前才開始提中華民國主權，過去3年卻不怎麼提中華民國。（編輯：蘇龍麒）1081106

South Korea’s Yu is exploding to buy a luxury home. Han camp: the public can also buy and sell real estate.
06 Nov 2019, 17:34 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Wang Chengzhong, Taipei, 6th) The weekly magazine reported that the KMT’s presidential candidate, South Korea’s Yu, had purchased millions of luxury homes. South Korean Yu’s spokesperson He Tinghuan said today that the property has been overestimated by the Korean Yu couple’s financial affordability. The property will be sold before the house is handed over, and the public has the right to buy and sell real estate.
Weekly reported that South Korea Yu was the general manager of North Agriculture, and was still unemployed. He ordered a Nangang luxury home with a total price of NT$72 million, and pointed out that it was composed of Korean Yu’s wife Li Jiafen and friends. The House of the House of Fame is ordered. In addition to the previous farmhouses, there are now thousands of luxury homes, and the outside world is questioned that the source of Korean Yu’s property is unknown.
In the morning of the media interview with the Central Party of the Kuomintang, He Tinghuan said that the Korean Yu couples intended to go to Taipei to develop their homes. They chose to buy a house in Inner Lake. After the children’s problems, they needed more space, so they decided to dispose of the property in Neihu. The loan will be used to purchase the pre-sale house in Nangang, and the first period and part of the interest will be paid. It may be because of the ability to overestimate the financial burden, so it will be sold before the delivery.
For Li Jiafen to participate in the house purchase of the bride, and the fact that the Korean Yu was unemployed at the time, how to buy a mansion and question the breakdown of the image of the people, He Tinghuan pointed out that Li Jiafen had never heard of the participation in the Gui Women’s Regiment, and that the people refer to civilians, unprivileged people, and the people. It also has the right to buy and sell real estate, which is a personal financial plan.
The media asked that the DPP's Taipei City Councilman, Jane Shupei, questioned that during his time as the general manager of North Agriculture, South Korea Yu had imported a large number of Chinese-made kiwifruits to pretend to be New Zealand's kiwifruit. He Tinghuan said that the financial planning of Beinong is a joint resolution of the company and the board of directors. South Korea Yu is the general manager. The operation status and profitability of Beinong are quite good performances for decades. I hope that Jian Shupei cares about the current municipal administration. Don't deliberately question because of smearing and filth.
Regarding the part of the deputy, He Tinghuan said that South Korea Yu emphasizes that the deputy is a very important part of the mind, and there are also suitable candidates. The candidates who meet the expectations of the society and the will of the public will be introduced.
The media asked, Lin Feifan, deputy secretary general of the DPP, questioned that the slogan of South Korea’s Yu has never been honored. He Tinghuan pointed out that during the election campaign, South Korea Yu certainly put forward a lot of public opinion policies. After the election, it will be honored one by one. It has always emphasized that it hopes to defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China. Instead, it is the DPP that keeps defending sovereignty. Provocations have made cross-strait relations tense, diplomatic relations have been broken, and the sovereignty of the Republic of China has only begun to be introduced before the election. The Republic of China has not been mentioned in the past three years. (Editor: Su Longzhen) 1081106
