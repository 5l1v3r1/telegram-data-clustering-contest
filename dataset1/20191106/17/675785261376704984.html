      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits Manchester United's transfer business could be limited in January.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are looking to strengthen their struggling squad after a miserable start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Attacking reinforcements are on the agenda as well as an extra midfielder after struggling for goals so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer says they are aware of the difficulties of doing business in January as he hinted they could wait until the summer to do the bulk of their business.</p>
      <p>After signing youngsters Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James in the summer, as well as centre-back Harry Maguire, Solskjaer confirmed long-term additions are again on the agenda as he continues his rebuild.</p>

      <p>Asked about their transfer plans ahead of their Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade, Solskjaer told reporters: "The priority now is to get the players fit and get to the next round [of the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/uefa-europa-league/4c1nfi2j1m731hcay25fcgndq">Europa League</a> ].</p>
      <p>"We always look at the long term with transfers, it might be none, might be one, might be two in January.</p>
      <p>"It's always the summer... you can’t really do too many big deals in January."</p>

      <p>United can guarantee a place in the last 32 of the Europa League with a win on Thursday.</p>
      <p>And Solskjaer says the emergence of several young players such as Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams has been the major positive from the European competition so far.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer added: "We’ve seen some young players getting a chance and doing well.</p>
      <p>"Mason's [Greenwood] given us a winner, Brandon [Williams] was fantastic in Belgrade, Jimmy [Garner] came through that game really well. We have given other players a chance to play which is important in the long run.</p>
      <p>"For me, it’s been good to give the young kids a chance. Good to see young players play games and we’ve kept three clean sheets and that’s impressive."</p>
