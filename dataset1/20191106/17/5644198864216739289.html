      <p>TOKYO: Mitsubishi Corp, Japan's biggest trading group, said on Wednesday (Nov 6) it would shut its Singapore-based crude oil and fuel trading unit after revelations in September that a trader there racked up enormous unauthorised trading losses.</p>
      <p>The unit, Petro-Diamond Singapore, will lose about 34.2 billion yen (US$314 million) before taxes after closing the unofficial trading positions. That means the final debt for the unit could be as high as 30.8 billion yen, the company said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Mitsubishi, Japan's biggest trading house by sales, said in September that a trader lost US$320 million in unauthorised transactions in crude oil derivatives and that the matter had been reported to the police.</p>
      <p>The trader, Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang, denied any wrongdoing in a statement issued through a lawyer.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>These were the first such losses at Mitsubishi, which invests in everything from salmon to natural gas and trades many commodities globally.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi will bring some oil and fuel trading back to Tokyo, Chief Financial Officer Kazuyuki Masu said during the company's first-half results briefing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Since it booked such a big loss, we could not reinvest in the same company and it's better to reinforce our management system," Masu said.</p>
      <p>He added that the company's oil trading in the United States and Europe was unaffected. In recent years, Mitsubishi had shifted its oil trading headquarters to Singapore.</p>
      <p>Some settlements would be done in Hong Kong, he said. Masu did not say how many staff would be cut or affected by the shutdown. Petro-Diamond has about 50 employees in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi also said it would cut its full-year earnings forecast because of the Petro-Diamond losses and lower coal prices.</p>
      <p>The company expects profit to be 520 billion yen for the year through March, down from a forecast of 600 billion yen.</p>
      <p>First fiscal-half profit fell 22 per cent to 242.4 billion yen, the company said.</p>
      <p>Petro-Diamond staff weren't told of the decision until Wednesday and are "shocked," a person with direct knowledge of Petro-Diamond's operations told Reuters. The person was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Since the losses came to light, Mitsubishi has required all of its to be reviewed by Mitsubishi headquarters in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi has had no contact with Wang and does not know where he is, other than that he is outside Singapore, Masu said.</p>
