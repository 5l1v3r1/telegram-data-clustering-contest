Chris Evans Joins Billy on the Street, Runs Into Paul Rudd
06 Nov 2019, 17:46 by Megh Wright



Billy Eichner is wise enough to know that there’s only one way to celebrate the fact that Billy on the Street is now available to watch on Netflix, and it’s by making more Billy on the Street. In a new episode released today, Eichner is joined by special guest Chris Evans, who is there to promote his new movie Knives Out, but really just becomes a pawn in Eichner’s game when he bombards some New Yorkers with a simple question and clipboard: “Sir, for a dollar, would you like to sign this petition to remove Kevin Spacey from homosexuality and add Chris Evans?” Later, Eichner and Evans just so happen to run into Paul Rudd on the street (Very convenient!), so Eichner turns the segment to “Who Would You Rather Have Sex With: Chris Evans or Paul Rudd?” Even better than bringing back a classic Billy on the Street guest and segment, Eichner seals the deal at the end with the reprise of the show’s greatest gift of all: “Now Chris and I are joined by Chris’s worst nightmare: a bunch of lesbians that don’t care that he’s hot! Let’s go lesbians, let’s go!”
