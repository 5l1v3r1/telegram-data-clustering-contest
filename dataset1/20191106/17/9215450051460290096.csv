銀行職員享十成按揭 買600萬樓慳165萬元利息
06 Nov 2019, 17:53 by 樓市
大家有冇留意第三季負資產個案由上季僅1宗，急升至53宗呢？不過又唔使咁擔心，因為金管局表示原來大部分個案都係屬於銀行職員住宅按揭貸款，相關貸款按揭成數比一般按揭保險計劃貸款較高，所以樓價連跌四個月後，呢批銀行職員都比較易跌入負資產界線。究竟銀行職員買樓會有咩優惠？而銀行員工按揭又著唔著數呢？

銀行員工可享十成按揭
多間銀行都有提供買樓優惠以挽留員工，本地某大銀行向員工提供十成按揭，最多可借款的月薪倍數由原來的100倍調高至120倍，至於按揭貸款息率方面最低息口為0.8厘。銀行員工同一般街客比，假設買$6,000,000嘅樓，月入都係$50,000、還款年期30年，而雙方都借足首置最高按揭成數嘅話，銀行職員每月還款額低至$18,752，比街客平咗成$2,937！最誇張嘅係利息總數只係$750,763，比街客嘅$2,408,086，慳成$1,657,323！

嘩，咁喺銀行做咪好著數？不過由於批核結果都要視乎實際個案情況或其他因素而定，未必真係有最低息同批足十成咁多，而且職員離職後，有關按揭優惠亦會隨之失效，需要向銀行償還優惠按揭成數與一般街客按揭成數嘅差額，所以部分唔想「賣身」俾銀行嘅職員，都會選擇放棄呢個員工按揭優惠。

Bank staff enjoys 10% mortgage and buys 6 million yuan and 1.65 million yuan interest
06 Nov 2019, 17:53 by the property market
Have you noticed that the number of negative assets in the third quarter has only risen from the previous quarter to only 53 cases? However, I am worried about it because the HKMA said that most of the cases were owned by bank staff residential mortgage loans. The loan-to-deposit ratio was higher than that of the general mortgage insurance scheme. Therefore, after the property price fell for four months, the bank was approved. Staff are more likely to fall into the negative asset boundary. Is there a discount for bank staff to buy a flat? And the bank employee mortgage is still counting the number?

Bank employees can enjoy a 10% mortgage
Many banks have offered buy-in concessions to retain their employees. A large local bank provides 10% of mortgages to employees. The maximum monthly salary that can be borrowed is increased from 100 times to 120 times, and the minimum interest rate for mortgage loan interest rates. It is 0.8%. Compared with the average street passengers, the bank staff is supposed to buy $6,000,000, with a monthly income of $50,000 and a repayment period of 30 years. Both parties have the highest mortgage rate for the first time, and the monthly repayment of bank staff is as low as $18,752. It is $2,937 than the street level! The most exaggerated amount of interest is only $750,763, which is $2,408,086, and $1,657,323.

Hey, what about the bank? However, as the results of the approval will depend on the actual circumstances of the case or other factors, it may not be the same as the minimum interest rate of more than 10%. After the staff leaves the post, the mortgage concession will also be invalid and will need to be repaid to the bank. The number of preferential mortgages is in line with the average street passenger mortgage. Therefore, some of the employees who wish to ""sell"" the bank will choose to give up their employee mortgage benefits.
