（中央社記者張榮祥台南6日電）台南市一名女消防員以「怕火」為由，拒絕進入火場，被消防局視為頭痛人物，將送公懲會建議淘汰；市長黃偉哲今天也表示，消防員形象絕不容遭到少數人破壞。
這名拒進火場的女消防員，10多年前從外縣市調到台南市，狀況不斷，市議員林宜瑾今天在市議會質詢此事，要求市府正視消防員的適任性問題。
消防局長李明峯告訴中央社記者，消防局昨天已召開考績會，就今年6月起的勤務缺失，一口氣記了這名拒進火場的女消防員8支申誡，消防局也準備將這名女消防員調整到不得請領消防加給的職務，且將送公懲會建議淘汰。
黃偉哲得知台南市有女消防員竟因怕火拒進火場，直言「嘆為觀止」；他表示，雖然在無人受困或高危險性火場，消防員可行使退避權，但對這名女消防員的出勤狀況卻不適用。
黃偉哲說，若因一人的勤務問題影響整體消防戰力，就會影響人民的生命財產安全，消防員形象絕不容遭到少數人破壞，市府將依法處理這名女消防員相關職務與加給領取。（編輯：謝雅竹）1081106
