BTS's V did it again. After his last and phenomenal performance of Singularity for the Speak Yourself Tour: The Final, he went viral for his similarities with Howl from the animation “Howl’s Moving Castle”. He also earned the new nicknames Black Swan, Fallen Angel, and Hades. Now fans are demanding a live-action movie with BTS V as the lead character.









In addition to the many fan-arts created in V’s likeness, some talented fans also created new special ones, with V as Howl.












BTS' fans, ARMY, found a number of similarities between the two. Even results of a Twitter search for ""Howl"" often showed V, whose real name is Kim Taehyung.



What’s even more surprising is that V was found listening to Howl's Moving Castle OST back in 2017.



There's no doubt that black feathered “Singularity” will remain in history as one of BTS' most iconic performances. While The Final concert of the Speak Yourself Tour gained the attention of worldwide media, V's performance stood out among them, trending Worlwide on twitter. He was also featured on National TV KBS' Entertainment Weekly as the highlight of the final concerts in Seoul.
Can we expect BTS V as Howl from Howl's Moving Castle at any time in the Future? Fans are eager and hoping it to see it become a reality.
