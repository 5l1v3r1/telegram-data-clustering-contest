      <p>Today’s <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/truck/">trucks</a> fill a plethora of roles for consumers. Some need a truck’s versatility for hauling and towing while others want their truck to offer a luxurious ownership experience with high-quality leathers and the latest technologies. So, it’s no surprise customers can buy some expensive trucks that require luxury-car levels of money. The 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/silverado/">Chevy Silverado</a> in the video above, which has nearly $32,000 worth of upgrades, is the latest example of how easy it is to add a new car's worth of accessories to a truck. </p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/">Chevy</a> truck started life as a $50,295 LTZ, but how did the final price get to $82,096? The 6.2-liter V8 under the hood added $2,495. It has the $550 Z71 Package that adds Rancho shocks and skid plates while the spray-in bed liner was a $545 option. The Silverado also got the LTZ Premium Package that included the power up/down liftgate, navigation, and more. </p>
      <p>The price really skyrockets with the aftermarket upgrades – nearly $21,000 of goodies. That includes a 6-inch lift, BF Goodrich all-terrain tires, Black Widow rims, and tinted windows. The two-tone look isn’t a wrap – it’s painted that way. Other upgrades include the wheel-to-wheel running boards, black exhaust tips, and new mufflers. </p>

      <p>Inside, the Black Widow logo is embroidered on the headrests. The logo is also used as puddle lamps. The truck features heated and ventilated seats, a leather-wrapped heated steering wheel, and a sunroof. Aftermarket upgrades include gloss-black painted interior trim on the doors and center console, and red LED footwell lights. </p>
      <p>Are all these upgrades necessary? Of course not. Then again, justifying a $50,000 truck as need would be a stretch for most people. But that’s not the point. Trucks have a robust aftermarket scene that does allow owners to customize their rides in any way they want. And that’s pretty neat. </p>
