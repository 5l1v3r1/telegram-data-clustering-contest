      <h1>David Wain’s Next TV Project Refuses to Be Labeled</h1>

      <p>David Wain has teamed up with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/jimmy-fallon-head-writer-a-d-miles-leaving-tonight-show.html">former <i>Tonight Show </i>head writer A.D. Miles</a> for a new television project, and it will <i>not </i>be pigeonholed into one TV category because it seems to be absolutely everything at once. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/daily-sitcom-david-wain-works-warnermedia-1252572"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>,<i> </i>WarnerMedia Entertainment has given a four-episode pilot order to a scripted series from the pair titled <i>Today’s Special</i>,<i> </i>described as “an ambitious potential series that blends the storytelling mechanics of a daily soap opera, the tone and style of a single-camera sitcom and the topical responsiveness of late-night TV.”</p>
      <p>The show will be set in a 24-hour diner “that serves as a hub for a diverse group of characters. The lives of the staff and regulars intertwine in ongoing storylines while also reacting to trending topics and the day’s headlines.” If the show ends up landing a series order, the plan would be to shoot and air it on a daily basis like a late-night show. Unclear yet is which of WarnerMedia’s platforms the series would call home, but <i>THR </i>notes that TNT, TBS, TruTV, and HBO Max are all possibilities.</p>
      <p>In addition to <i>Today’s Special</i>,<i> </i>Wain is behind a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/childrens-hospital-medical-police-netflix-comedy-huebel-hayes-wain.html"><i>Children’s Hospital </i>spinoff of sorts over at Netflix titled <i>Medical Police</i></a>,<i> </i>which was ordered to series back in February. Erinn Hayes and Rob Huebel are slated to star, and co-writer Rob Corddry, Malin Åkerman, Lake Bell, and Ken Marino will appear in guest roles. Netflix hasn’t yet announced a premiere date for the series.</p>
