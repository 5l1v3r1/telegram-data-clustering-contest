        <b>The mogul turned 50 this week</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sean ‘<a href="http://nme.com/artists/diddy">Diddy</a>‘ Combs  turned 50 earlier this week, and his mother celebrated by splashing out on a car worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
      <p>The rapper and mogul’s mother Janet Combs purchased a Cadillac Escalade, which can be worth over $100,000 depending on the model, and handed it over complete with ribbon in a video presentation at her son’s party.</p>
      <p>As footage shared on Twitter shows below, Diddy (who was of course wearing a golden crown), could barely contain himself when the present was revealed, jumping up and down and screaming.</p>

      <p>Diddy has been celebrating his birthday throughout the week on Twitter and shows no sign of slowing down. “IT’S MY BIRTHDAY!!!! I’M 50 &amp; I FEEL GREAT. I MADE IT TO HALFTIME. LET’S GOOOOO!!!! #DIDDY50″ he tweeted on the day, along with a video about his life so far.</p>

      <p>Earlier today, meanwhile, he posted a video dancing to DJ Kool’s ‘Let Me Clear My Throat’ wearing shorts and slippers, saying: “I told y’all I’m celebrating my birthday for 365 days!!!”</p>
      <p>Diddy’s next half century may not be as productive as the first, however. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/diddy-says-hes-in-semi-retirement-in-interview-with-dj-khaled-2562443">he revealed that he’s in “semi-retirement”</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m contemplating, ‘Is there a role for me in music now?’” Diddy said in a conversation with <a href="http://nme.com/artists/dj-khaled">DJ Khaled</a>, published in <i>Rolling Stone</i>.</p>
