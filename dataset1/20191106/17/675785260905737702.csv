However, the rocker appears to enjoy incognito outings as he cut a low-key figure that made him totally unrecognisable in the Italian capital of Rome on Tuesday.
The Maggie May hitmaker, 74, ensured he was not mobbed by fans by concealing his famous features.
He sported a tweed flat-cap atop of his trademark mullet and wrapped a silk scarf - decorated with a paisley leaf design - around his neck.
Rod seems to like to stay down - to - earth as he was spotted shopping in high street retailer Zara during his solo shopping trip where he examined different jeans and chinos for sale and tried on a coat.

He said: “No one knows this, but I thought this was about time I told everybody. I’m in the clear, now, simply because I caught it early. I have so many tests.”
Addressing the men directly, he pleaded: “Guys, you’ve got to really go to the doctor.”
And he had the crowd in stitches when he said of the physical examination for the disease: “Finger up the bum, no harm done.”
He said: “If you’re positive, and you work through it and you keep a smile on your face...I’ve worked for two years and I’ve just been happy, and the good Lord looked after me.”
