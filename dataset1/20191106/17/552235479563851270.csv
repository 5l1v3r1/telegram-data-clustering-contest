Former Auchinleck Talbot hero David Gormley is on collision course with his old club in the fourth round of the Junior Cup.
The new Rossvale manager - who has won his first six matches in charge of the Premiership outfit - saw his side paired with the holders and favourites in Wednesday's draw.
Gormley hit the winner for Talbot when they lifted the trophy in 2013 beating Linlithgow Rose 1-0.
Talbot will head to Glasgow for the tie of the round while, elsewhere, 2016 winners Beith face a long trip north to face Aberdeen East End and giantkillers Kirriemuir, who beat last year’s finalists Largs in the 3rd round, take on Tayport at home.
