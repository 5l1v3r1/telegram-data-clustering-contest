      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A school voucher group and a conservative law firm are suing state education officials for allegedly withholding voucher students' test scores for a day and intentionally skewing them to make it appear the students performed poorly.</p>
      <p>School Choice Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed their lawsuit Wednesday in Jefferson County Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>They allege the Department of Public Instruction released standardized test scores for only public school students to the media Sept. 11, a day before releasing both public and voucher students' scores publicly. The groups allege state law requires a release of all data at the same time.</p>
      <p>The groups also allege the department lumped all voucher students together in aggregate English and math scores to make the results look bad.</p>
