      <h2>We've heard ridiculous hotel guest requests before but one man has upped the stakes by asking staff to organise his hamster being flown over to join a family holiday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:46:11+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>VIP hotel guests often have access to private butlers and concierge staff to cater to their every whim, even when they have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/hotel-guests-ridiculous-complaints-revealed-10944331">ridiculous complaints</a> or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/weird-hotel-breakfast-orders-12633934">weird breakfast orders</a> .</p>
      <p>Now, members of staff are spilling the beans on the most ridiculous requests they've received.</p>
      <p>One guest has seriously upped the stakes - all it took was the family hamster.</p>
      <p>While on holiday, he noticed that his daughter was very much missing her pet hamster (something a lot of parents can relate to).</p>
      <p>So, to cheer her up, he asked the hotel staff to organise for the hamster to be flown over asap to join them on their family holiday (something a lot of parents won't be able to relate to).</p>
      <p>Of course said hamster couldn't fly solo, so a pet handler was also hired to escort the fluffy guest all the way to the hotel and directly delivered to the delighted girl.</p>

      <p>Jim Strong, Virtuoso agent and President at Strong Travel, told <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/confessions-of-the-worlds-top-travel-fixers">Conde Nast Traveler</a> : "Another client of mine - a big investment banker who has many homes - was worried about his daughter, who was anxious about being separated from her pet hamster during their family vacation.</p>
      <p>"I made arrangements with an airline to secure two seats: one for the hamster, and one for a handler for the pet.</p>

      <p>"They flew from New York to L.A., and the handler delivered the hamster right into the hands of the child. Everyone was very happy to be reunited."</p>
      <p>Yup, the hamster got its very own seat. No, we don't know if it was in First Class - but either way we reckon that it would have been quite the surprise for fellow passengers!</p>
      <p>Of course it is possible to fly with pets - for example, one woman even <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/passengers-surprised-woman-boards-flight-19337025">boarded a flight with her miniature pony</a> - but we can't get our heads around someone forking out for a flight to bring a hamster out to join their holiday.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time we've heard of employees being tasked with some of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/hotel-staff-reveal-guests-most-13587406">bizarre requests from VIP guests</a> which come their way - but a hamster getting flown across the US for a holiday is definitely one of the stranger ones!</p>
