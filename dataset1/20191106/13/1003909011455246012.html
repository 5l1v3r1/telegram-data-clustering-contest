      <h1>Atco Blue Flame Kitchen: Getting Back to Our Roots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:00:13+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen</a></address>
      <p>As Canadians, it’s easy to lament our long winters and short growing season. Instead, why not celebrate the bounty of hardy root vegetables?</p>
      <p>Roasting vegetables at a high heat helps to caramelize their natural sugars. Our Roasted Root Vegetables recipe dresses some of our favourite root vegetables in a maple-balsamic-mustard glaze to enhance the vegetables’ earthy sweetness and add some extra zing.</p>
      <p>Parsnips may simply look like white carrots, but they’re so much more. Our Ginger Parsnip Soup highlights the unique peppery flavour of the vegetable, layering on sweetness from carrots, onions, honey, and maple syrup. Topped with a dollop of crème fraîche, this rich soup is sure to warm you up.</p>
      <p>Our Mediterranean Potatoes are like a warm potato salad, pairing the hearty tuber with the colours and flavours of the Mediterranean. Serve this tasty side dish with roast chicken, lamb, or pork for a complete meal.</p>
