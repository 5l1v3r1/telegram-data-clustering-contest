06 Nov 2019, 13:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】2005年11月6日以《Twins (Knock Out)》出道的韓國人氣男團Super Junior，今天（6日）迎來出道14周年。今年是所有成員完成兵役後迎接的第一個紀念日，成員們也為此表達心聲及對粉絲的感謝之情。
在韓國時間邁入6日之際，Super Junior成員銀赫、利特、東海、藝聲、神童、始源等人都透過個人SNS寫下感言。銀赫上傳了一張牆壁上寫有「14街」的照片，寫下：「14年，5110天，122,640個小時，7,358,400分鐘，441,504,000秒，一起走過漫長的時間，今後也一起走過無限的時間。」



隊長利特則於凌晨兩度更新，他首先寫下「14周年」，接著又上傳了由他們的歌名所組成的「14」字樣，配以ELF（官方粉絲名）以手燈營造出的「寶藍色手燈海」為背景的照片。
他寫道：「Super Junior的第14個生日，生日快樂！現在還年幼呢，按年齡來算的話，現在是小學畢業，剛進國中。E.L.F謝謝你們，好像還可以再繼續下去。2005年11月6日以來，哪怕是一天都沒有悠閒過，努力的生活到了現在，回報的是創造了現在的數字。散步著一起走下去吧！但想著這是一場馬拉松，心情就會變得輕鬆些。謝謝你們，我愛你們。」



東海上傳了成員們將手疊在一起的照片，並表示：「我所愛的ELF，分享著14周年的生活，謝謝你們。ELF讓我知道，時間並不是單純地流逝，而是逐漸積累的。不是在鼓掌之際離開，而是一邊鼓掌一邊守護我們。我愛你們。」



始源則上傳了成員們的合照，寫下：「一起走過的14周年。回首走至今天的路，刻劃出一步步淺淺的足跡，每一步都帶有我們的熱情與青春。非常期待今後的時間。謝謝你們。我愛你們。Let’s celebrate our 14th anniversary. Cheers.」



神童、希澈、藝聲也同樣透過SNS上傳了短語。今日傍晚，始源還簡短在IG開啟直播，他唸到韓國、馬來西亞、埃及、沙烏地阿拉伯、印尼等地區的粉絲留言，以不同語言分別簡短問候各國粉絲之際，還說了一句「台灣老婆，Okay，你好」，向台灣粉絲問候。
