玖壹壹春風遭榔頭暴打　生日當天被call補戲下場超慘
06 Nov 2019, 13:51 by 熊景玉, 蕭志傑
國片少見海難題材電影《海霧：驚濤駭浪》日前殺青，今（6）日舉行殺青派對。夯團玖壹壹團員春風首次參演電影，他雖覺得很好玩，但他竟在生日當天被導演錢人豪叫去補戲，還慘被李李仁被捅死，實在觸霉頭，還好錢人豪馬上補了個紅包給他去去霉氣。錢人豪也笑說：「那天也是我的結婚紀念日啊！忙到完全忘記。」
李李仁說，春風先是被他用榔頭敲頭，導演嫌不夠慘，才會叫春風再來補一場被他捅死的戲。而敲頭戲原本要用借位卻但被嫌太假，但他與春風是好兄弟，實在下不了手，最後真的不小心打到。他在戲中還與王心恬有親密戲，也是第一次演戲的王心恬，處女作不用上「船」，但要上「床」，有較大尺度的性感演出。


鄭人碩（左起）王陽明、李李仁擔任該片男主角，三人之間也有深刻糾葛。

但王心恬表示，自己是模特兒出身，平常走秀穿的衣服可能露得還更多，所以比較起來她還比較擔心自己的演技，可是現場大家反而比較關心她的尺度。但她其實最露也只是穿著內衣而已，不過還要分別面對王陽明與李李仁，兩位男士也算是一飽眼福，李李仁還爆料看得出來王心恬與他對戲時整個人都在抖！


王心恬片中飾演按摩女郎，有只穿著內衣的親熱戲，但她並不在意尺度，因為當模特兒時穿過更露的衣服。

導演錢人豪還被李李仁爆料，好幾次半夜2點突發奇想要拍跳海戲，但半夜跳海危險性太高，隔了2週找來幾輛水上摩托車及橡皮艇後才開拍。包括李李仁、王陽明、連凱等人在沒有安全措施，也沒有人指導的情況下，從1.5層樓高的船上跳下海。李李仁透露，他們原本搭的船還在前進，因此很容易就會被捲進去，相當危險，而且整個海面黑黑的，既可怕又很容易會胡思亂想。他們公推年紀最輕的王陽明跳海技術最好，因為只有他用頭部入水，可見相當專業。


李康生特別受邀客串，他笑稱拍得相當輕鬆，沒有壓力。

李康生則在兩部片的空檔中抽出兩天特別來客串，他飾演一位即將沉船的船長，他笑稱自己演得相當輕鬆，不用拍打戲、也不用與怪物對戲，導演給他很大自由度發揮；而連凱在接到演出邀請後，一個月就留出一臉落腮鬍，還接了長髮，被虧根本是「台版基努李維」。
與王陽明有五年交情的春風，這次是衝著王陽明來拍的，兩人平常愛聊車、聊音樂，但王陽明對春風演戲相當有信心，要劇組一定得讓春風演出一個角色，他還大讚春風在戲中一個回眸眼神超有戲味，實在不像第一次演電影的人。至於片酬，春風害羞表示，自己是第一次演出，當然不及其他演員多。


導演錢人豪率劇組成員出席殺青趴。

電影還有巨大的蜘蛛釀成海難，劇組打造了一大一小兩個實體蜘蛛模型，也用上電腦特效，場面不小。且演員們也有上船拍攝，但船上有許多生鏽的鐵屑，在拍動作戲扭打間很容易受傷，王陽明、謝沛恩等人都因此去打破傷風針以防感染。

They promoted the youngest Wang Yangming to jump into the sea with the best technology, because only he used the head to enter the water, which is quite professional.


Li Kangsheng was specially invited to guest appearances. He laughed and said that it was quite easy to shoot and there was no pressure.

Li Kangsheng took two days of special guest appearances in the gap between the two films. He played the captain of a ship that was about to sink. He laughed and said that he played quite easily. He didn’t have to shoot a movie or play against a monster. The director gave him a very With a lot of freedom to play; and even after receiving the invitation to the show, Lian Kai left a face for a month, and also received long hair, and the loss was simply ""Taiwan version of Kenu Liwei.""

The two usually love to talk about cars and chat music, but Wang Yangming is quite confident in the spring breeze acting. The crew must let the spring breeze perform a role. He also praised the spring breeze in the play, a look back and super play, it is not like the first person to play a movie.
