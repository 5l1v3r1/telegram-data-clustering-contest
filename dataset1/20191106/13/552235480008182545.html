      <h2>Council plan to get "rid" of building</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:51:50+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>An Ayr day centre for disabled people will shut leaving nine council staff getting £289,0000 voluntary redundancy.</p>
      <p>Social workers have found new places for most of the 24 people who currently use the Kyle Day Centre. But two families still need to find a replacement service before it closes on New Year’s Eve. </p>
      <p>A council boss said there are now plans to get “rid” of the Kyle Day Centre building at St John’s Primary. <br/>Speaking at this week’s leadership panel SNP Councillor Julie Dettbarn said: “It is never an easy decision to close a service.”</p>
      <p>Depute leader Councillor Brian McGinley, Labour,  said: “These are very vulnerable people.</p>
      <p>“Change could be difficult for them.”</p>
      <p>He called for assurances that efforts are being made to find a new service for them.</p>
      <p>South Ayrshire Council complained there wasn’t a proper consultation on the move.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken by the Integration Joint Board, which oversees health and social care. </p>
      <p>Chief executive Eileen Howat said: “This is probably a bad example of how we would go through the process.”</p>
      <p>A council report presented to councillors said: “It is acknowledged that there has been a lack of consultation with the council during the decision making period.”</p>
      <p>Fifteen people who go to the centre will now attend Hansel instead while another two will go to Turning Point and elsewhere. </p>
      <p>The Kyle Day Centre staff who decided not to take voluntary redundancy are due to be redeployed elsewhere in the council . </p>
      <p>It is predicted the closure will save  £180,736 annually. </p>
      <p>The Integration Joint Board is under pressure to cut spending in health and social care as it faces mounting debt.</p>
      <p>The crisis hit board has racked up £3.2 million debt forcing South Ayrshire Council to wade in with the cash to keep services running. </p>
      <p>The board has made savage cuts, including scrapping Franks’ Law funding for disabled people, three months after it came into force in Scotland. </p>
