      <p>TORONTO -- An arrest warrant has been issued for a California woman who stands accused of murder after giving birth to a stillborn boy.</p>
      <p>Police in Hanford, Calif. say tests found that the boy had more than six times the toxic limit of methamphetamine in his system.</p>
      <p>"The levels of methamphetamine in this baby's sytem were such high levels even for an adult, so we believe that [the mother] was using almost the entire time that she was pregnant," Hanford Police Sgt. Justin Vallin <a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/family-asking-woman-to-turn-herself-in-after-giving-birth-to-stillborn-with-toxic-level-of-meth/">told KSEE-TV</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not the first pregnancy during which Chelsea Becker used meth, according to her aunt.</p>
      <p>Julie Lance said that the boy was Becker's fourth son. One-year-old Silas is in the custody of the state, while Lance adopted three-year-old Troy.</p>
      <p>"Troy was born addicted to meth and we got him when he was two years old," she said.</p>
      <p>A four-year-old boy has also been adopted. Becker was using meth during each pregnancy, Lance said, and each baby had meth in his system at birth.</p>
      <p>Family members describe Becker as a smart and beautiful woman whose life has spiralled downward due to meth.</p>
      <p>"I want her to turn herself in," cousin Terra Ordonez said.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for her to straighten up and get clean, because I know she's smart enough to get out of it."</p>
