      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina">North Carolina</a> authorities forged ahead Wednesday with a massive statewide <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/manhunt">manhunt</a> for a 13-year-old accused of a double murder -- with the multipronged operation employing boots on the ground and helicopters in the air -- to find the teen, who gave officials the slip after a Tuesday <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">court appearance</a>.</p>
      <p>The North Carolina <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Department of Public Safety</a> said in a news release that the escaped teen, identified only as Jericho W., escaped around 12:10 p.m. in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast">Lumberton</a> after going before a judge.</p>
      <p>"Division officials have a high degree of concern for the safety of both the juvenile and the public, due to a prior history of assaultive and unpredictable behavior," <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NCPublicSafety/photos/a.170817319713027/2355357861258951">the agency said</a>.</p>

      <p>"My baby's out here somewhere, nobody knows, and he is all alone and hopefully he is safe wherever he is at," Jacobs said. "I just wish that he would come back, turn himself in and get the help that he needs."</p>

      <p>Officials <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rcso3100/posts/2653303438055798?__tn__=-R">have described</a> the 13-year-old as having brown eyes with brown hair. They say he is 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 110 pounds.</p>

      <p>At one point, officials warned residents in the area of Planetarium Road about "low-flying helicopters" as darkness fell, in addition to "dozens of officers" deployed on the ground.</p>
      <p>Authorities later cleared the area, but said that deputies were continuing to work to find the escaped teenager. The 13-year-old and a 19-year-old were charged in October when deputies found two men, Frank Thomas, 34, and Adam Thomas, 33, dead in a home they shared, <a href="https://www.wral.com/man-teen-charged-after-brothers-found-dead-in-lumberton-home/18702659/">WRAL reported at the time</a>.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the 13-year-old is asked is to call Matthew Jenkins with the Department of Public Safety Communications Center at (919) 825-2726 or the Robeson County Sheriff’s Office at (910) 671-3170.</p>
