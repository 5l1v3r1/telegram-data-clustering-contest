晒頭髮遮眼加口罩生活照 容祖兒疑遭大陸封殺

06 Nov 2019, 13:23

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】香港歌手容祖兒因日前在社交網站貼出一張長髮遮眼和戴口罩的自拍照，並配文「只知要飛」，被意外捲入「港獨」風波。不僅引來大陸微博網民圍剿抨擊，甚至傳出她因此遭大陸電視台晚會封殺。
香港民間的「反極權」抗爭持續不斷，警方對民眾的暴力鎮壓也不斷升級。而被中共挾持的港府，為了阻嚇民眾的和平遊行集會，繞過立法會直接頒布《禁蒙面法》，並在10月5日開始實施。
該惡法規定，市民在公共地區時，不能配戴口罩、頭套等蒙面物品，否則港警能依法行事。警方有權要求任何人除下面罩，若拒絕，最高刑罰為監禁1年或罰款25,000港幣，引起市民強烈不滿和國際譴責。
近年大部分行程定在大陸的香港歌手容祖兒，日前在微博和IG貼出一張素顏、戴著口罩、頭髮散落遮住一隻眼睛的自拍照，並在帖文中寫上歌曲《空港》中的歌詞「只知要飛」四字。

據容祖兒後來解釋，照片和配文本來是示意自己在飛機上準備出發到其它地方。但是，微博引來大陸網民轉發並氣勢洶洶地直指：「容祖兒！她戴口罩，遮眼，她表達什麼意思？是支持暴徒在香港的行為？」隨即大批小粉紅轉發和抨擊。
因為此前網上曾接連發起晒遮右眼照，聲援被香港警方用布袋彈射爆右眼球的女護工，因此，儘管容祖兒刪除這張頭髮遮眼加口罩照片，並就「蒙面照」解釋「只知要飛」不過是歌曲《空港》的一句歌詞，表示自己「熱愛祖國，熱愛香港，從不支持港獨」，但仍止不住網民在微博攻擊「別來賺人民幣了」、「滾出中國」、「抵制港獨分子容祖兒」等。
11月3日，湖南衛視在微博公布今年「雙十一」晚會的明星陣容。本來名單上出現過容祖兒的名字，但大陸網民瘋狂轟炸湖南衛視的官方微博，11月4日，湖南衛視更新晚會陣容名單，發現容祖兒的名字已「被消失」。
現在，容祖兒的微博仍被網民灌爆：「說實話，何韻詩比你有骨氣，至少她不賺人民幣，擺明立場，你這樣打擦邊球，兩邊你都得罪了。」也有另外的網民留言：「微博的鍵盤俠是另一種暴徒！」「笑死，小粉紅又玻璃心。」

06 Nov 2019, 13:23

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Hong Kong singer Joey Yung posted a long-haired self-portrait on his social networking site and read the article ""I only want to fly"" and was accidentally involved. Hong Kong independence. Not only did it attract the mainland microblogging netizens, but even she was banned by the mainland TV station.
The ""anti-authoritarian"" struggle in Hong Kong has continued, and the police's violent suppression of the people has also escalated. The Hong Kong government, held by the CCP, in order to deter the people from peaceful marches and assemblies, bypassed the Legislative Council and directly promulgated the ""Forbidden Mask Method"", which was implemented on October 5.
The evil law stipulates that when the public is in a public area, they cannot wear masked articles such as masks and headgear, otherwise the Hong Kong Police can act in accordance with the law. The police have the right to ask anyone to remove the cover. If refused, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 1 year or a fine of 25,000 Hong Kong dollars, causing strong public dissatisfaction and international condemnation.
In recent years, most of Hong Kong singer Joey Yung, who is scheduled to travel on the mainland, posted a photo on Weibo and IG, wearing a mask, wearing a mask and covering her eyes with a hair, and wrote the song ""Airport"" in the post. The lyrics of ""I only know how to fly"".

According to Joey Yung’s later explanation, the photos and accompanying texts indicated that they were preparing to leave for other places on the plane. However, Weibo attracted mainland netizens to forward and swayed: ""Yong Zuer! She wears a mask and covers her eyes. What does she mean? Is it supportive of the mob's behavior in Hong Kong?"" Then a large number of small pink forwards and snipers.
Because the Internet has been initiating a sun-baked right-eye photo on the Internet, the support of the Hong Kong police used a bag to explode the female eyewife who exploded the right eye. Therefore, although Joey Yung deleted the photo of the hair mask and mask, and explained the ""masked photo"" I only know that I want to fly. It is just a lyric of the song ""Airport"". He said that he ""loves the motherland and loves Hong Kong and never supports Hong Kong independence"", but he still can't stop the netizens from attacking ""Do not make RMB"" on Weibo. Get out of China, ""Resist Hong Kong's independence, and grow up.""
On November 3, Hunan Satellite TV announced the star lineup of this year's ""Double Eleven"" party on Weibo. The name of Joey Yung appeared on the list, but the mainland netizens madly bombed the official Weibo of Hunan Satellite TV. On November 4th, Hunan Satellite TV updated the list of the party’s lineup and found that the name of Joey Yung was “disappeared”.
Now, Joey Yung's Weibo is still being bombarded by netizens: ""To tell the truth, He Yunshi has a temperament than you. At least she doesn't earn RMB, and she stands in a position. You beat the ball like this, you are offended on both sides."" There are also other netizens who leave a message: ""The keyboard man on Weibo is another mob!"" ""Laughter, pink and glass heart.""
