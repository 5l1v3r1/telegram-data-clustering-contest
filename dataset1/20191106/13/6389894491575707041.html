      <p>Boris Johnson has urged voters to back him in order to get parliament working “for you”.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside Number 10 after an audience with the Queen to officially dissolve parliament, Johnson said the choice was to “come with us – a government that believes in a dynamic economy – or vote for Labour, “the only alternative”.</p>
      <p>The PM went onto attack Labour for its position on Brexit, which would take up the bulk of next year with another referendum, causing more “dither and delay”.</p>
