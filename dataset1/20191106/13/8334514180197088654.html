      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged voters to back his Conservatives in a Dec. 12 election or face the “horror show” of two referendums next year if Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn was elected.</p>
      <p>Officially launching the start of campaign from outside his Downing Street residence, Johnson said that if he was returned to power with a majority he would get on with ratifying his Brexit deal straight away.</p>
      <p>“Come with us, get Brexit done and take this country forward, or, and this is the alternative next year, spend the whole of 2020 in a horror show of yet more dither and delay,” he said.</p>
      <p>“(Labour) would spend the whole of 2020 having two referendums, one on Scotland ... and another referendum on Brexit.”</p>
