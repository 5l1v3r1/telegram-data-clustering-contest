Atco Blue Flame Kitchen: Getting Back to Our Roots
06 Nov 2019, 13:00 by ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen
As Canadians, it’s easy to lament our long winters and short growing season. Instead, why not celebrate the bounty of hardy root vegetables?
Roasting vegetables at a high heat helps to caramelize their natural sugars. Our Roasted Root Vegetables recipe dresses some of our favourite root vegetables in a maple-balsamic-mustard glaze to enhance the vegetables’ earthy sweetness and add some extra zing.
Parsnips may simply look like white carrots, but they’re so much more. Our Ginger Parsnip Soup highlights the unique peppery flavour of the vegetable, layering on sweetness from carrots, onions, honey, and maple syrup. Topped with a dollop of crème fraîche, this rich soup is sure to warm you up.
Our Mediterranean Potatoes are like a warm potato salad, pairing the hearty tuber with the colours and flavours of the Mediterranean. Serve this tasty side dish with roast chicken, lamb, or pork for a complete meal.
ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLES



1/4 cup canola oil
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp whole grain mustard
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp freshly ground pepper
3 1/2 cups halved trimmed radishes (about 1 lb)
3 cups sliced carrots (1 inch)
3 cups cubed peeled sweet potatoes (1 inch)
2 cups cubed parsnips (1 inch)
2 cups cubed peeled rutabaga (1 inch)
2 cups chopped red onions
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Whisk together oil, vinegar, maple syrup, mustard, salt and pepper until blended.
Combine radishes, carrots, sweet potatoes, parsnips, rutabaga and red onions in a large bowl.
Add oil mixture and toss until vegetables are coated.
Transfer vegetable mixture to a greased large roasting pan.
Bake, uncovered, stirring once, for 45 minutes or until vegetables are tender and lightly browned.  Serves 10.
GINGER PARSNIP SOUP



1 tbsp canola oil
2/3 cup finely chopped fresh ginger
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 cups chopped parsnips

Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add ginger and garlic; sauté for 2 minutes. Add parsnips, carrots, onions and thyme; sauté until onions are softened, about 7 minutes. Add broth and honey; stir to combine.  Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until parsnips and carrots are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove and discard thyme. Using a hand blender, purée mixture until smooth. Stir in cream, maple syrup and butter, stirring until butter is melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately topped with a dollop of crème fraîche. Serves 8 as a starter.
