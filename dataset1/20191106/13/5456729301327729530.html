      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:27:05+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/world-foreign/361254-turkey-captures-wife-of-dead-is-leader-al-baghdadi.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>President Recep Erdogan on Wednesday announced that Turkey has captured Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s sister and wife in Syria, a week after the Islamic State leader was killed in a U.S. operation.</p>
      <p>He provided no further details as he addressed theology students in Ankara.</p>
      <p>“Al-Baghdadi took himself out in a tunnel. You know, America launched a very solid communication campaign about this,’’ Erdogan said.</p>
      <p>“We captured his wife. But, we did not make a fuss out of it. I announce it for the first time today,’’ he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Erdogan did not say where or when she was detained.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Turkey said it had taken into custody al-Baghdadi’s sister Rasmiya Awad during a raid in the Syrian town of Azaz, as well as her husband, daughter-in-law and five children.</p>
      <p>Mr Erdogan confirmed on Wednesday that Mr al-Baghdadi’s sister and brother-in-law were taken into custody “on the Syrian side.’’</p>
      <p>Mr Al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself the caliph, or leader, of Islamic State in 2014. He died during a U.S. raid in October in Barisha, in the north-western Syrian province of Idlib.</p>
      <p>U.S President, Donald Trump announced Mr al-Baghdadi’s death on October 27, saying he blew himself up after he was trapped by US special forces in a tunnel within a compound in Barisha.</p>
