      <p>No-one ever seems to live in a dream house won in a raffle, so CBS News began to wonder if there was ever really a dream house at all. It turns out that the San Francisco 'Dream House' raffle has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9yXq9fuHMo">"never awarded its top prize" of a dream house</a>.</p>
      <p>The fine print: there was a winner in two of the ten years tracked, but the fees associated with accepting the $10m prizes are so ominous (eating at least half the value of the prize from the outset, with taxes to come) that the winners will always plump for alternative cash prizes instead.</p>
