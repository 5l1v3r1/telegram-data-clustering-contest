川普牌失靈 肯塔基州長意外連任失敗

（中央社肯塔基州法蘭克福5日綜合外電報導）美國民主黨今天意外贏得肯塔基州長選舉，總統川普支持的現任州長連任失敗。州議會方面，在郊區高漲的反川普情緒拉抬之下，民主黨25年來首次掌控維吉尼亞州議會。
川普明年將爭取第2個4年任期，今天肯塔基州、維吉尼亞州、密西西比州、新澤西州4州的選舉結果，或能替明年大選發展提供些許線索。
儘管川普選前之夜趕來造勢，肯塔基州現任州長貝文（Matt Bevin）仍意外落敗，不敵父親曾任肯州州長的民主黨籍州檢察長貝希爾（Andy Beshear）。
川普在肯塔基州列星頓（Lexington）的選前之夜告訴選民，必須讓貝文連任，不然專家就會說他「吃了世界歷史上最大的敗仗」。
2016年總統大選，川普在肯州以30個百分點擊敗希拉蕊．柯林頓。
川普這樣的發言，反映出52歲的貝文有多想把這場州長選戰拉高到全國層級，在民主黨主導針對川普的彈劾調查之際，強調他對川普的支持。
選舉結果雖對川普而言是重大挫敗，但貝文敗選的原因，或許和他本身的因素比較有關。川普在肯塔基州人氣相對仍高，但貝文之前和工會以及教師發生衝突，民調顯示，他可能是全國民望最低的州長。
貝希爾今晚已宣布勝選，貝文仍拒絕承認敗選，還說有「舞弊」情事。
另一方面，民主黨人也從原本擁有微弱多數的共和黨手中，拿下維吉尼亞州議會兩院的掌控權。這是1/4世紀以來，民主黨首次完全掌握維州政府。（譯者：鄭詩韻/核稿：張曉雯）1081106

Trump failure failed Kentucky governor failed to re-elect
06 Nov 2019, 13:51 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 5th, comprehensive foreign news report) The US Democratic Party unexpectedly won the Kentucky Governors election today, and the current governor, supported by President Trump, failed. In the state legislature, the Democratic Party took control of the Virginia State Legislature for the first time in 25 years, driven by the rising anti-Chuanpu sentiment in the suburbs.
Trump will fight for the second four-year term next year, and the results of the elections in Kentucky, Virginia, Mississippi, and New Jersey today may provide some clues for the next year's election.
Despite Trump's pre-election night, the current governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, was unexpectedly defeated, and lost to the Democratic State Attorney General Andy Beshear, whose father was the governor of Kenya.
Trump told voters in the pre-election night in Lexington, Kentucky that Bevan must be re-elected, or experts would say that he ""eats the biggest defeat in world history.""
In the 2016 presidential election, Trump defeated Hillary in 30 points in Kenya. Clinton.
Trump’s speech reflects how much the 52-year-old Bevan wants to raise the governor’s election campaign to the national level, emphasizing his support for Trump as the Democratic Party led the impeachment investigation against Trump.
Although the election results were a major setback for Trump, the reason for Bevin’s defeat may be related to his own factors. Trump’s popularity in Kentucky is still relatively high, but Bevan’s conflict with unions and teachers before, polls show that he may be the lowest governor of the country.
Beshir has announced his victory tonight, and Bevan still refuses to admit defeat and also says there is a ""fraud"".
On the other hand, the Democrats also took control of the two chambers of the Virginia State House from the hands of the Republican Party, which had a weak majority. This is the first time since the 11/4 century that the Democratic Party has fully mastered the Victorian government. (Translator: Zheng Shiyun / Nuclear Release: Zhang Xiaowen) 1081106
