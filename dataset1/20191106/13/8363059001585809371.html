      <h1>Forget Battered Mars Bars - Battered Quality Street are the Future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:00:23+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Here in 2019, we don't bother frying whole chocolate bars anymore – well not at Poppies fish 'n' chip shop in Camden at least.</p>
      <p>Throughout December, you'll be able to stroll into Poppies of Soho's Camden locale and order yourself a bag of battered Quality Street in place of your cod and chips - or as well as, depending on how hungry you are.</p>
      <p>For £2.50 you'll get a lucky dip bag of five, which could well be anything, and for those of you who are so adamant that the fruit ones are so bloody delicious, I hope that's all you get. Enjoy your battered orange, and strawberry nightmares.</p>
      <p>The treats/abominations will be available from December 1 to 25 and is sure to cause many a heart attack - or come very close. [<a href="https://londonist.com/london/food-and-drink/battered-quality-street-poppies-fish-chips-christmas">Londonist</a>]</p>
