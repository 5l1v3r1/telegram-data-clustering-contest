      <p>Rockwell said it best when he sang "I always feel like somebody's watching me."</p>
      <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration posted an eery image of its remotely operated vehicle Deep Discoverer being watched by a giant squid in an unspecified part of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/oceans">ocean</a>.</p>
      <p>"[C]heck out this lurking deep-sea squid, seen creeping above remotely operated vehicle Deep Discoverer (D2) as the vehicle explores the face of a scarp feature during Windows to the Deep 2019," NOAA wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OceanExplorationResearch/photos/a.132365606866807/2285826274854052/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook post</a>. "Ever get the feeling you’re being watched?!"</p>

      <p>Despite the fact the giant squid has largely remained evasive to humans, this is not the first time NOAA has spotted a giant squid on one of its Okeanos missions.</p>
      <p>In June, NOAA <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/squid-gulf-of-mexico-rare-amazing-video">spotted</a> a huge <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/fish">squid</a> in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/oceans">Gulf of </a><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> as part of rare footage that biologists have described as "the most amazing video you've ever seen." The giant cephalopod was spotted around 100 miles southeast of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana">La</a>.</p>
      <p>The largest giant squid ever recorded was nearly 43 feet long and likely weighed almost 2,000 pounds, according to the <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/giant-squid">Smithsonian</a>.</p>

      <p>Fairly elusive, the giant squid has been linked to myth since ancient times. <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/article236981047.html">The Charlotte Observer</a>, citing data from <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/mermen-architeuthis-our-fascination-giant-squid">The National Museum of Natural History</a>, noted ancient sailors mistakenly believed giant squids were mermaids and other mythical creatures.</p>
      <p>"For a long time, people saw mysterious movements in the water or found dead giant squid and didn't know what they were—and even confused a giant squid carcass with a merman or mermaid," the museum wrote on its website.</p>
