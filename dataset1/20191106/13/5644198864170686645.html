      <p>REUTERS: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain notched his fourth goal in as many games in Liverpool's 2-1 Champions League win over Genk and while he is pleased with his free-scoring form since returning from injury the midfielder says he is still short of his best.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but has shone on his return, his goal on Tuesday helping Liverpool go top of Group E with nine points.</p>

      <p>"I feel like I'm getting better," he told the club website https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/372343-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-genk-reaction.</p>
      <p>"I've been trying to sort of dribble a bit more and get that side of my game back because that sort of stuff can take a bit of a while when you've been out for a while.</p>
      <p>"Overall, I think there's more to come from me for sure."</p>
      <p>Captain Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum have formed a solid midfield trio for Liverpool in recent months but Oxlade-Chamberlain's goalscoring threat and playmaking qualities will give manager Juergen Klopp a selection headache.</p>
      <p>"To get into the team you've got to be able to press in a certain way with a certain intensity," Oxlade-Chamberlain said.</p>
      <p>"The way Gini, Hendo and Fab did it (against Tottenham Hotspur) was brilliant ... if you're not sort of hitting those standards then you'll struggle to get a game regularly, so I've been battling to try to get that side of things back."</p>
      <p>Liverpool host Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday.</p>
