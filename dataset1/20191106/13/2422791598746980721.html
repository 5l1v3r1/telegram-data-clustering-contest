      <p>LONDON -- The principal players behind the "This Is Spinal Tap" film have resolved their dispute with Universal Music Group over the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner have issued a statement saying UMG will continue to distribute Spinal Tap's recordings, and eventually the rights will go back to them as the creators.</p>
      <p>Shearer had filed the original lawsuit in 2016, alleging the four had earned less than US$100 in music sales income and $81 in merchandising income between 1984 and 2006.</p>
      <p>Guest, McKean and Reiner joined the lawsuit in 2017. Their complaint against film production company Studio Canal is ongoing.</p>
