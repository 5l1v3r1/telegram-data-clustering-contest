        <b>It's a warts-and-all look at life in the band.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/brockhampton">Brockhampton</a> have shared a snippet from their forthcoming web docuseries <i>Keeping the Band.</i></p>
      <p>From the brief clip, it appears that the show will provide an unfiltered look at life within the hip-hop band, with footage of live performances being contrasted against dramatic backstage rows.</p>
      <p>“Y’all ain’t performing like performers right now. Y’all don’t look like performers out here. What are you doing?” bandleader Kevin Abstract remonstrates at one point in the clip.</p>
      <p>Another moment shows the band interacting with their fans, as one runs up to Abstract and tells him during a hug: “My spam account is called kevinabstractisgay.”</p>

      <p>The trailer comes after Brockhampton released new album’Ginger’, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/brockhampton-new-album-ginger-2541093">in August </a>, the second album  to be released under the band’s record deal with RCA.<br/>It is the follow-up to 2018’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/2382090">‘Iridescence’.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slowthai-guest-brockhampton-new-song-heaven-belongs-to-you-ginger-album-2540957">‘Ginger’ features a collaboration with Slowthai on the track ‘Heaven Belongs to You’.</a> The record also includes the previously released singles <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/brockhampton-i-been-born-again-track-review">‘I Been Born Again’</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-brockhampton-new-song-if-you-pray-right-2536253">‘If You Pray Right’</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/brockhampton-ginger-album-new-video-boy-bye-2538291">‘Boy Bye’</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/brockhampton-unveil-new-music-video-no-halo-ahead-ginger-release-2540678">‘No Halo’.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>NME</i> for their <a href="https://www.nme.com/the-big-read-slowthai">Big Read</a> interview, Brockhampton’s Kevin Abstract said that the collective had attempted to make “a summer record” with ‘Ginger’ but found themselves being affected by the current state of Donald Trump’s America.</p>
      <p>“[With ‘Ginger’] we were trying to make a summer album, but midway through we were like, ‘Damn, all these songs have hooks and are catchy, but they still feel kind of sad,’” said Abstract.</p>
      <p>“The songs feel dark, but that’s because we chase what we feel in our hearts, not what’s on the radio.”</p>
      <p>“‘Ginger’ is the sound of the lyrical weight of ‘Iridescence’ being forcibly lifted off the band, with auto-tuned melodies floating around a catchy, snappy beat. It’s utter bliss.”</p>
