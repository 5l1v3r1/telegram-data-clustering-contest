      <h1>Women Are Better And Safer Drivers Than Men, New Study Claims</h1>

        <b>For years, female drivers have had to endure cruel jokes about their parking abilities, with men widely regarded to be more capable behind a steering wheel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However – to the dismay of many a bad ’90s comedian – a new study could well have just thrown this stereotype into sharp reverse.</p>
      <p>Indeed, findings from this study reveal British women to be better and safer drivers than their male counterparts, and will no doubt cause lively debate amongst many a car-sharing couple.</p>

      <p>This research – conducted by insurance comparison website <a href="https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/gender-gap-100-drivers?awc=4445_1572952839_90c3f80a576a0767fb57a78fa170b579&amp;utm_source=affiliatewindow&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=id_dm_aj_1040+quote&amp;awc=4445_1573025186_723d7ad76dcd1f2fdf83876a248dc3ff#">Confused.com</a> – found 539,000 people were convicted for breaking the law while driving in England or Wales in 2018.</p>
      <p>Out of these 539,000 individuals, a staggering 79% of lawbreakers were found to be blokes, who outnumbered women by nearly 4:1.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, men were also found to be far more likely to be found guilty of the most commonly committed motoring offences, with a quarter of the offences recorded due to men speeding.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, men were also found to be five times more likely to be convicted for drink-driving offences, and were more than twice as likely to be found at fault after making an insurance claim.</p>

      <p>Worryingly – and perhaps unsurprisingly – bad drivers aren’t always aware their skills aren’t up to scratch, even when the points are staring them in the face.</p>
      <p>Claire Rogan, digital marketing manager at automotive retailer Peter Vardy, has expressed concern over the gap between a driver’s past records and their assessment of their own competency on the road, as detailed in this study.</p>
      <p>For example, despite the fact Ford drivers will likely have more points on their licence than other UK drivers, they rated their driving skills as being a sturdy 7.3 out of 10, while assessing other drivers to be just six out of 10.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rogan explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Taking proper due care and attention when behind the wheel should always be at the forefront of our minds when in control of a car, so it is surprising to see our research indicate that over half of British drivers have been penalised for driving offences.<br/><br/>Whether you have just passed your test, or have been driving for years, it is important to not allow your own perception of your driving skill to cloud your judgement.</blockquote>

      <p>Although women drivers are still racing ahead in some regards, their motoring prowess comes screeching to a halt when it comes to driving tests.</p>
      <p>Out of the 1.6 million people across England and Wales who took their driving test in 2018, 55% failed, 31% of whom were women and 24% men. Furthermore, out of the 45% who passed, 22% were women while 23% were men.</p>
