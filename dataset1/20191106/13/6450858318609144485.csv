Xiaomi's Mi Note 10 is not available in the UK just yet, but buy the Global version through GearBest and you'll get a significant discount with the phone down to just £392.50! 
We're expecting great things from Mi Note 10, not least from its 108Mp penta-lens camera - a world first. Other specs include a 6.47in AMOLED Dot Drop display, the Snapdragon 730G processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a huge 5,260mAh battery that boasts 30W wired charging.
GearBest has earned our trust as a vendor that we have been using for many years to supply Xiaomi phones for review. It's listing Mi Note 10 for £478.85 (in Europe it will retail at €549), but using the discount code GBMINOTE10 at checkout you can snap it up for just £392.50.
Anticipating huge demand, GearBest has now added two new codes that unlock the same low price: GBMINOTE10FB and GBMINOTE10EM.
GearBest is offering Mi Note 10 in:


Midnight Black


Aurora Green


Glacier White
