        <b>Although the Friends star has been on the platform for less than a month, she seems to be completely in her element there.

      <p>Jennifer Aniston, who has amassed 18.5 million followers in less than four weeks after sharing a snap with the Friends cast, has shared a photo of herself in a minimalistic black dress with a plunging open-back wowing fans with her top-notch shape.</p>

      <p>The 50-year-old star was photographed by someone from behind in her alluring ensemble with a black clutch as she was promoting her new movie, The Morning Show, on an around-the-globe press tour. She titled the snap in the caption to the sneak-peek behind the scenes “Jen in Black” – an apparent reference to Men in Black.</p>
      <p>The photo <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910191077090283-jennifer-aniston-rocks-instagram-with-her-first-tbt-baby-picture/">tickled</a> the fancy of the Instagram crowd, gaining nearly four million likes and thousands of comments, including shout-outs from other celebrities. Another Hollywood stunner, Olivia Wilde, shared her admiration for the senior colleague with several fire emojis, as did actress Jenna Dewan.</p>
      <p>Michelle Pfeiffer and Julianne Moore could not give Aniston a miss as well.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hawt”, Moore noted, while Pfeiffer posted a simple “WOW” and a fire emoji.</blockquote>
      <p>Comedian/actress Whitney Cummings could not help but praise Aniston’s toned physique.</p>
      <blockquote>“Wait do you have abs on your back too?” she jokingly posted.</blockquote>
      <p>Jennifer Aniston<a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910151077055237-she-is-there-for-you-friends-star-jennifer-aniston-joins-instagram-shares-the-gang-reunion-post/"> took Instagram by storm</a> in October, uploading a selfie with her colleagues, who played the lead roles in Friends, one of the world's most successful comedy series and a pop-culture phenomenon. While the post gained over 14 million heart reactions, the 50-year-old star, who became the fifth most highly paid actress in 2019, set a Guinness World Record for reaching the one-million milestone quicker than anyone in the past. Before her, the record belonged to Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.</p>
