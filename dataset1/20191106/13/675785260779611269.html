      <h2>WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: The mother parasite laid over a dozen eggs inside him before doctors came to the rescue in South China's Guangdong Province</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:29:39+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, John Feng, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>This is the disturbing moment shocked doctors discovered a family of tiny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach">cockroaches</a> living inside a man's ear.</p>
      <p>Unsuspecting Mr Lv, 24, wanted to get to the bottom of his head problem at Sanhe Hospital in Huiyang, South China.</p>
      <p>He said he felt a sharp pain in his right ear while sleeping so his family members shone a torch into his ear canal. They found what appeared to be a large cockroach inside.</p>
      <p>Ear, nose and throat specialist Zhong Yijin recalled: "He said his ear hurt a lot, like something was scratching or crawling inside. It caused a lot of discomfort.</p>
      <p>"I discovered more than ten cockroach babies inside. They were already running around."</p>

      <p>The newly hatched nymphs, which were small and lighter in colour than their black and brown mother, were of the German cockroach species Blattella germanica, the hospital said.</p>
      <p>Doctor Zhong plucked the tiny insects from Mr Lv's right ear one by one using a pair of tweezers, before also removing the much larger mother roach.</p>
      <p>According to the hospital, Mr Lv suffered minor injuries to his right ear canal. He was prescribed with ointment and cream, and discharged on the same day.</p>

      <p>The hospital's head of ENT, Li Jinyuan, told local media that Mr Lv had a habit of leaving unfinished food packets near his bed, attracting parasites such as cockRoaches.</p>
      <p>Female cockroaches carry up to 40 eggs, reports say.</p>
      <p>Deputy head of ENT Jiang Tengxiang advised: "Household hygiene helps to prevent the appearance and spread of cockroaches.</p>

      <p>"Disinfect drains and sewers. Use mosquito nets and screens on windows.</p>
      <p>"That'll stop insects from flying or crawling into your noses and ears."</p>
