      <p><b>WOONSOCKET, R.I.</b> - CVS Health revenue surged more than 36% in the third quarter, nearly a year after acquiring one of the nation's largest health insurers.</p>
      <p>The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager also said Wednesday that it filled more prescriptions as net income climbed 10% to $1.53 billion in a performance that topped analyst expectations.</p>
      <p>The Woonsocket, Rhode Island, company runs more about 9,900 retail locations and processes over a billion prescriptions annually as a pharmacy benefit manager. Late last November, it added health insurance for more than 22 million people when it completed a roughly $69 billion acquisition of Aetna.</p>
      <p>That deal helped push revenue to $64.81 billion, while adjusted earnings totaled $1.84 per share in the quarter.</p>
      <p>Those results easily topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings of $1.77 per share on $63.03 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.</p>
      <p>CVS Health also saw pharmacy claims climb in the third quarter more than 9% from its pharmacy benefit management side, which runs prescription drug plans for customers like insurers and employers.</p>
      <p>The overall performance prompted CVS Health Corp. to raise its 2019 forecast again after starting the year with an outlook that disappointed Wall Street.</p>
      <p>The company now expects 2019 earnings to range from $6.97 and $7.05 per share. That's up from a forecast it made in August and higher than the average expectation on Wall Street for earnings of $6.98 per share, according to FactSet.</p>
      <p>Company shares climbed 2 percent to $68.91 in premarket trading Wednesday.</p>
      <p>That price had risen only about 3 percent so far this year as of Tuesday's close while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was up nearly 23 percent.</p>
