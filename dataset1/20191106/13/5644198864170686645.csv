Free-scoring Oxlade-Chamberlain keen to keep improving for Liverpool

06 Nov 2019, 13:05

REUTERS: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain notched his fourth goal in as many games in Liverpool's 2-1 Champions League win over Genk and while he is pleased with his free-scoring form since returning from injury the midfielder says he is still short of his best.
The 26-year-old missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but has shone on his return, his goal on Tuesday helping Liverpool go top of Group E with nine points.

""I feel like I'm getting better,"" he told the club website https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/372343-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-genk-reaction.
""I've been trying to sort of dribble a bit more and get that side of my game back because that sort of stuff can take a bit of a while when you've been out for a while.
""Overall, I think there's more to come from me for sure.""
Captain Jordan Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum have formed a solid midfield trio for Liverpool in recent months but Oxlade-Chamberlain's goalscoring threat and playmaking qualities will give manager Juergen Klopp a selection headache.
""To get into the team you've got to be able to press in a certain way with a certain intensity,"" Oxlade-Chamberlain said.
""The way Gini, Hendo and Fab did it (against Tottenham Hotspur) was brilliant ... if you're not sort of hitting those standards then you'll struggle to get a game regularly, so I've been battling to try to get that side of things back.""
Liverpool host Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday.
