      <p>JAKARTA, Nov 6 — US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said today Washington’s review of a trade preference facility for Indonesia would conclude soon, and predicted “far more investment” by US companies in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.</p>
      <p>The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has been reviewing Indonesia’s eligibility for the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) facility for more than a year due to concerns about market access for US goods, services and investment.</p>
      <p>Speaking after meetings with Indonesian ministers and ahead of a meeting with President Joko Widodo, Ross said both sides had agreed to step up efforts to conclude the review.</p>
      <p>“We’re comfortable and confident that very quickly (the outstanding issues) could be resolved,” Ross told reporters in the Indonesian capital.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ll see far more investment from American companies and far more bilateral trade than exist right now.”</p>
      <p>The GSP programme gives privileged trade status to developing economies.</p>
      <p>By retaining GSP and opening up more market access both ways, Indonesia and the United States aim to more than double their trade in the next five years to US$60 billion (RM248 billion), Indonesian Chief Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said.</p>
      <p>Total two-way trade was worth US$28.6 billion last year, according to Indonesian trade ministry data.</p>
      <p>“We want to open access for our furniture and textiles and we have programmes to import more cotton and wheat from the US,” Hartarto said.</p>
      <p>Some 80 per cent of the negotiations for the GSP facility, which reduces duties on US$2 billion of Indonesian exports, have been completed, he said, adding that talks should be wrapped up before Christmas.</p>
      <p>US companies including automotive firm Tesla and conglomerate Honeywell were seeking business opportunities, and Jakarta had promised improvements in the investment climate, Hartarto said.</p>
      <p>The United States ended GSP treatment for India in June, while facilities for Thailand was suspended last month.</p>
      <p>Ross was in Jakarta as part of a regional tour, during which the United States has been criticised for not sending higher-level officials to the back-to-back East Asian Summit and US-Asean Summit in Thailand.</p>
      <p>The administration of US President Donald Trump was “fully committed” to Asia, Ross told a business forum in Bangkok on Monday.</p>
      <p>He repeated that to reporters in Jakarta. “Any thought that we’re losing interest in this region is totally wrong,” he said, calling South-east Asia “very, very important”. — Reuters</p>
