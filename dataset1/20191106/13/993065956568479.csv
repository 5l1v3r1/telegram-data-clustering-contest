Her debut — When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? — is one of the top-selling albums of the year. It launched multiple top 40 hits including Bad Guy, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Lizzo, nominated for three AMAs, released her debut in 2013 but she achieved major success this year.
Her two-year-old song Truth Hurts topped the Hot 100 chart for seven weeks and her three-year-old song Good As Hell just reached the Top 10 on the pop charts and is number one on the R&B charts. Lizzo released her major-label debut album, Cuz I Love You, earlier this year.
Previously announced performer Taylor Swift will receive the artist of the decade award at the AMAs, where she is nominated for five honours.


Taylor Swift is up for five awards (PA)

Throughout her career, she has won 23 AMAs and she could break Michael Jackson’s record of 24 wins.
Swift will compete for the top prize — artist of the year — along with Post Malone, Ariana Grande, Drake and Halsey.
