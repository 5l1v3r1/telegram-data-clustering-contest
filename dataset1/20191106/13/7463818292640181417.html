      <h1>Pixel 4 XL Durability Test: See if it’s worth the price tag</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T13:00:52+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rei Padla</a></address>
      <p>We’ve only been waiting for this: the Google Pixel 4 Durability Test. It took Zack Nelson a while to check on the smartphone but that’s fine. The results are in and we can’t say we’re that happy. The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the latest flagship smartphones from the tech giant. They come with some nice new features but lack those the market deems important. For a 2019 flagship offering, the Pixel 4 line isn’t as modern as the premium flagships or even mid-rangers from other markets.</p>
      <p>The Pixel line is supposed to be the ultimate Android phone. Well, that’s what we’ve been thinking the past few years since Google knows the mobile platform best. A Pixel phone must embody what everything is best about Android. Unfortunately, it’s not the case.</p>
      <p>Google hasn’t made any big changes in the design. Last year’s notch has been removed this year, resulting in an obvious top bezel. It’s for a good cause because the selfie camera is still there.</p>
      <p>The unique camera module we’ve been mentioning before the official launch became a reality. However, it was quickly overshadowed when the Apple 11 Pro was revealed bearing the same design. The device doesn’t have a microSD card slot and no headphone jack. There are only two cameras when top OEMs today have been pushing for three, four, and even five.</p>
      <p>The <b>Google Pixel 4 XL</b> has been scratched, burned, and bent. The usual scratch test reveals the display scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7. The black paint of the casing seems to be thick but can easily chip.</p>

      <p>Putting the screen under the light doesn’t do anything. What’s disappointing is that the phone bends a little when forced from the front. Doing it from the back doesn’t do any damage but doing so from the screen especially breaks in the part of the camera.</p>

      <p>This shouldn’t happen to a phone that expensive. At $899, the Pixel XL may not be worth it if durability is a major requirement. If you already have the phone, we highly recommend getting a rugged phone case.</p>
