Comedian Susan Calman is taking over from Jackie Bird to front BBC Scotland's Hogmanay coverage for the first time this year.
The News Quiz panellist will host a pre-recorded party featuring chat and music from Travis and other groups in Susan Calman's (Not Quite) End of Year Show on the BBC Scotland channel on December 31.
From 11.30pm she will be joined by Des Clarke and Amy Irons, who will help her bring in the new year from around Scotland in Hogmanay 2019, which will be on both the BBC Scotland channel and BBC One Scotland.
Strictly Come Dancing star Calman said she is looking forward to hosting the coverage, which was presented by Bird for 20 years.
 
She said: ""Hogmanay is such an important occasion across the country and I'm delighted to be on hand to help usher in the new year.
""It's going to be a fun night packed with great comedy, entertainment and music.
""I always like to get a party started and hope everyone will join me to welcome in 2020 in spectacular fashion.""
Steve Carson, BBC Scotland head of commissioning, said: ""We've changed things a little this year so that we can bring all the key live moments from around Scotland, as we always do, as well as bringing great music for the hundreds of thousands who join us in their living rooms - and we also have a brand new presenting team of household names.
""It's great to have Susan, Des and Amy fronting our shows.""
