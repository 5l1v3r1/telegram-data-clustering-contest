Wave Hello to your Pokémon with this exclusive Pixel 4 app
06 Nov 2019, 13:31 by Ash

Are you a Pixel 4 user? Are you excited for the upcoming release of Pokémon Sword and Shield on November 15th? If you answered yes to both of these questions, then we have the app for you: Pokémon Wave Hello.

Exclusive to the Google Pixel 4, Pokémon Wave Hello uses the phone’s Motion Sense technology to let you wave, pet, and interact with your new Pokémon friends.



The Pokémon available in the app include the Galar region’s new starter Pokémon – Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble – along with everyone’s favourite Pikachu and the adorable Eevee.
You can download Pokémon Wave Hello for free on the Google Play Store by following the link here.
Pokémon Sword and Shield are the latest two mainline instalments in the Pokémon franchise and the first mainline original games to be released on the Nintendo Switch.
(We’re not including Let’s Go! Pikachu and Let’s Go! Eevee in that lineup because, although they are a lot of fun, they are also technically remakes.)



The game takes place in the brand new Galar region, believed to be based on the United Kingdom. There are plenty of new Pokémon to catch and befriend in this region – including the sheep Pokémon Wooloo, Farfetch’d’s long awaited evolution, and Gigantamax Pokémon.
However, The Pokémon Company appears to have cut out several old Pokémon from the game, causing a lot of strife amongst Pokémon fans who are demanding the return of the National Dex.
Pokémon Sword and Shield launches November 15th on Nintendo Switch.
