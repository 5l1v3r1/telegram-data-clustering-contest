      <p>The trade relation between Nigeria and Japan is taking a good shape, as Japan is showcasing 37 firms at the ongoing<b> Lagos International Trade Fair</b>. The Asian country has renewed interest in collaborating with Nigerian firms to accelerate growth in the domestic economy.</p>
      <p><b>The Commissioner/Managing Director</b> of Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), Shigeyo Nishizawa <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/11/06/japan-seeks-greater-collaboration-with-nigerian-firms/">made known</a> that Japan wants deeper trade and investment with Africa’s biggest market and had asked the private sector in both countries to exploit opportunities inherent in their relationship.</p>
      <p><i>“The Nigerian government is trying but has its challenges. However, private companies in Nigeria have sufficient buying power to collaborate with Japanese firms in improving the Nigerian market,”</i> Nishizawa said.</p>

      <p><b>The Japanese pavilion</b> also featured financial services firms like Double Feather Partners and IT companies with innovative products like SNRI.</p>
      <p><b>The synergy between</b> the Japanese and Nigerian businesses is also very visible as their SATO collaboration is making social impact at the fair. The introduction of SATO helps to make Nigeria open defecation-free through its affordable, smart, plastic toilets that can be mounted over pit latrines to create more hygienic toilets.</p>
