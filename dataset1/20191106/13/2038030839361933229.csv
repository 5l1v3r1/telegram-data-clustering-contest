Cape Town - Catherine, The Duchess of Cambridge, is just like you and me. Sometimes she just wants to have a good time at the pub with her friends.
Kate joined her fellow school-mums for a drink at a pub in Chelsea last month, according to The Mail on Sunday.
How did she do it? Well, according to the publication, the 37-year-old, slipped into the Hollywood Arms via a secret entrance in a rear alleyway that her brother-in-law Prince Harry reportedly used to use.
Kate went to a 'meet and greet' drinks party, held each year for parents of new pupils at Thomas's school in Battersea.
Princess Charlotte started at the school - which her brother George attends - in September.
Kate and William, The Duke of Cambridge, have three children George (6), Charlotte (4) and Louis (1).
According to a source at US Weekly, the royal couple would love to have another child, so who knows? Maybe there will be another royal tot soon!
