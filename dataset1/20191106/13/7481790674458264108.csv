両親が１歳息子にエアガンか…全身に「弾痕」数十発、父親「３歳兄が撃った」

06 Nov 2019, 13:37

　昨年１１月にエアガンで三男（当時１歳）を撃ってけがを負わせたとして、福岡県警は６日、自営業の父親（２４）と無職の母親（２４）の両容疑者（いずれも福岡県田川市）を傷害容疑で逮捕した。三男は翌１２月に肺感染症で死亡しており、県警は死亡の経緯についても慎重に捜査する。
　発表では、両容疑者は昨年１１月下旬頃、自宅で三男にエアガンを発射。ＢＢ弾と呼ばれるプラスチック弾を体に何度も命中させ、皮下出血を伴う約３週間のけがを負わせた疑い。２人は「エアガンで撃ったことはない。お互いに撃っているところも見たことはない」などと否認しているという。
　昨年１２月１日、母親が「息子が心肺停止の状態だ」と１１９番。三男は同県飯塚市の病院に搬送されたが、約１時間４０分後に死亡が確認された。死因は肺感染症だったが、顔を含め全身に数十発のエアガンの弾痕とみられる傷痕があったことなどから、県警は、事件の可能性があるとみて捜査していた。
　父親は県警の任意の調べに対し、三男の傷について「（三男の）お兄ちゃんが撃った」などと説明したが、長男は「撃っていない」と話しているという。自宅から複数のライフル型のエアガンが押収された。
　両容疑者は当時、三男と３歳の長男、生後３か月の長女との５人暮らしだった。長男と長女は昨年１２月以降、児童相談所に保護された。次男は２０１６年に病死しているという。
　同県田川児童相談所によると、県警から昨年１２月１日、「亡くなった子ども（三男）の体にあざがあり、虐待の疑いがある」と連絡を受けた。県警の要請もあり、長男と長女を保護したという。
　また、長男については昨年１月、「頬が腫れている」との通報が児相に寄せられていた。職員が家庭訪問したが、母親が「遊んでいて壁に頬をぶつけた」などと説明。虐待の事実が確認できないとして、保護しなかったという。

My parents are air guns for my one-year-old son ... Dozens of bullet holes all over my body, my father ""three-year-old brother shot""

06 Nov 2019, 13:37

In November last year, the Fukuoka Prefectural Police reportedly suspected both self-employed father (24) and unemployed mother (24) (both in Fukuoka) Tagawa City) was arrested on suspicion of injury. Mitsuo died of lung infection in December of the following year, and the prefectural police carefully investigate the circumstances of death.
According to the announcement, both suspects fired an air gun to their third son at home in late November last year. Suspected of hitting the body with a plastic bullet called a BB bullet many times and being injured for about 3 weeks with subcutaneous bleeding. The two deny that they have never shot with an air gun, and have never seen each other shooting.
“On December 1st last year, my mother said,“ My son is in cardiopulmonary arrest ”. The third son was transported to a hospital in Iizuka City, but the death was confirmed after about 1 hour and 40 minutes. The cause of death was a pulmonary infection, but the prefectural police were investigating that there was a possibility of an incident because there were scars that appeared to be dozens of air gun bullets throughout the body, including the face.
The father explained to the prefectural police that the third son's wound was “shot by (the third son's brother)”, but the eldest son said that he did not shoot. Several rifle-type air guns were seized from home.
Both suspects lived at the time with three sons, a three-year-old eldest son, and a three-month-old eldest daughter. The eldest son and eldest daughter have been protected by the child guidance center since last December. The second son is said to have died of disease in 2016.
According to the Tagawa Children's Counseling Office, the prefectural police contacted on December 1 last year saying ""There was a bruise on the body of a deceased child (third son) and there was a suspicion of abuse."" At the request of the prefectural police, the eldest son and eldest daughter were protected.
Also, regarding the eldest son, the child minister was notified in January last year that ""the cheeks were swollen"". The staff visited the home, but the mother explained that she “played and hit her cheek against the wall”. He did not protect him because he could not confirm the fact of abuse.
