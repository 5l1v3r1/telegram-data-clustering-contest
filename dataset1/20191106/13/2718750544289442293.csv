Last Christmas Gifts the World a Posthumous George Michael Song, ‘This Is How’
06 Nov 2019, 13:24 by Zoe Haylock
Three years after his death, one of George Michael’s final recordings has been released posthumously, thanks to the upcoming movie Last Christmas. Directed by Paul Feig, the man who brought you the fever dream A Simple Favor, among other hits, and written by Emma Thompson, Last Christmas uses all George Michael songs, including the brand new posthumous track, “This Is How (We Want You to Get High).” The song features in the final scene of the movie, which stars Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) and Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians). “This Is How (We Want You to Get High)” is upbeat, acoustic guitar–driven, and not about the collective experience of ditching Christmas with your family to smoke out the window in your childhood bedroom, to be clear. It’s a regular, non-holiday pop song, as normal as the man behind Wham! can get.
According to a statement from Universal Music, obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, “This Is How” was co-written and co-produced with James Jackman in 2012, then finishing touches were put on the song in 2015. It is the first George Michael release in seven years, before the singer’s death on Christmas Day 2016. Now, it has a special home in the film Last Christmas, which opens in theaters November 8.
