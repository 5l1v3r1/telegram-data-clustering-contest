（中央社記者劉世怡台北6日電）前總統馬英九等人因三中案被控違反證券交易法，台北地院今天傳喚馬英九出庭。委任律師提及馬英九就中視股權交易簽約沒印象，只記得當天見時任總統陳水扁就訪美經驗做交流。
台北地方法院上午對三中案中的中視公司股權交易案召開準備程序庭，傳喚馬英九到庭，對案件爭執與不爭執部分進行討論。開庭過程中，馬英九並未發言，全程由律師表達意見。
原本規劃一整天的庭期於中午結束，法官訊問檢辯意見後，諭知下次開庭時間為12月18日上午9時30分，就馬英九被控中影部分繼行準備程序。
法官問及馬英九是否知道就中視股權交易部分，中投公司於民國95年4月3日與榮麗公司簽訂協議書。
馬英九委任律師庭上表示，馬英九知道會簽約，但沒印象何時簽約、契約內容；馬英九當時是台北巿長率團訪美行程結束回國後，95年3月29日接洽總統府，想就訪美經驗與時任總統陳水扁交流，府方在同年4月1日表示歡迎，陳水扁與馬英九同年4月3日在總統府見面，這段時間馬英九記憶深刻的是這件事。
馬英九離開法院時面對媒體提問，95年4月3日去見陳水扁，真的不知道當天簽約賣中視股權，馬英九笑而不答。
台北地檢署起訴指出，馬英九、張哲琛、汪海清等人，在三中（中視、中影、中廣）交易等案中，造成國民黨新台幣72億多元的損害，涉犯證券交易法的非常規交易、特別背信、刑法背信等罪嫌，去年7月間對他們提起公訴；台北地院審理後，針對不同犯罪事實及不同被告，陸續開庭進行準備程序。（編輯：方沛清）1081106
