      <p>Established in 1909, the Last Post Fund is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that no veteran is denied a dignified funeral and burial, as well as a military gravestone, due to insufficient funds at time of death.</p>
      <p>Since inception, the Last Post Fund has arranged for the funeral and burial of more than 150,000 financially challenged veterans.</p>
      <p>Under the Last Post Fund Indigenous Veterans Initiative, we will also provide qualifying Indigenous veterans with a military marker and a traditional name inscription.</p>
      <p>Help us honour our Canadian Indigenous veterans. If you know of a veteran gravesite in need of a headstone or a veteran in need of funeral assistance, or if you are interested in helping to identify unmarked Indigenous veterans graves in your community, contact us at:</p>
