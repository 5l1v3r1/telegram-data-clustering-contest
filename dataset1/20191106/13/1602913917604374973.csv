(P) Donalam Călăraşi-eforturi susţinute pentru a menţine cota de piaţă. De curând am incheiat un parteneriat puternic
06 Nov 2019, 13:00 by Publicitate,








Donalam face parte din grupul italian Beltrame, cu o istorie de aproape 130 de ani în producţia de oţel laminat şi oţeluri speciale, care deţine fabrici în Italia, Franţa, Elveţia şi România, atingând o cifră consolidată de 1,24 miliarde de euro şi Ebitda de 115 milioane de euro în 2018.
În urma unui efort susţinut, Donalam Călăraşi a obţinut rezultate remarcabile în 2018, peste cele din 2017 şi chiar peste cele bugetate. “În ciuda unei concurenţe acerbe, precum şi a unei pieţe rezervate, am reuşit să atingem un nivel de activitate foarte bun în 2018. Am obţinut un EBITDA de 9%, ceea ce reprezintă un succes pentru industria noastră. Cu o creştere a volumului, dar şi prin creşterea preţurilor pe piaţa metalelor, am obţinut o cifră de afaceri de 99 de milioane de euro şi o creştere a cotei de piaţă relevante în Europa. Rezultatele noastre au avut o reflexie foarte bună în numerar, acest lucru ne permite să ne dezvoltăm în continuare "", a declarat pentru Donalam Călăraşi, CEO-ul lui Carlo Beltrame.
Rezultatele pozitive ne ajută să susţinem investiţiile viitoare. La sfârşitul anului 2019 vom finaliza o investiţie de aproape 4 milioane de euro într-un nou echipament special de tratare a barelor de oţel, care ne va permite să ne creştem portofoliul de produse şi care a fost finanţat prin fluxul de numerar al lui Donalam, păstrând sub control expunerea financiară.
Investiţiile ne duc la o rentabilitate crescută de fapt. Activitatea Donalam trebuie să devină cât mai eficientă şi performantă, de aceea sunt prevăzute alte investiţii ambiţioase pentru anii următori, pentru a ajuta componenta noastră tehnică să ne ţină pe piaţă la un nivel care contează. Planul de investiţii viitoare va permite Donalam să îşi reducă emisiile şi să producă cu amprenta minimă pe partea de mediu. Suntem obligaţi să ne permitem aceste investiţii, să putem pătrunde pe o piaţă complicată, o piaţă cu aplicaţii de înaltă calitate, să ieşim de pe câmpul de luptă al produselor de larg consum unde nu mai suntem competitivi, iar în viitor, vom fi şi mai puţin competitivi din perspectiva costurilor.
Cheltuielile noastre au crescut, salariile au crescut în ultimii 2 ani, precum şi creşterile elementelor de cost cu o pondere importantă: electricitate şi gaze, care ne reduc marja operaţională. Energia şi gazele au înregistrat creşteri semnificative, cred că toţi producătorii industriali au văzut aceste creşteri în ultima perioadă. Este greu să concurezi chiar şi cu produsele din vestul Europei, deoarece preţul energiei electrice şi al gazului este mai mare în România. Creşterea salariului minim la nivel national, precum şi creşterile salariale în sectorul bugetar au afectat şi creşterile salariale în Donalam.



Am atins un nivel de vânzări de 125.000 de tone în 2018, comparativ cu 108.000 de tone în 2017. Sperăm să ne menţinem constant volumul de vânzări în 2019, ne luptăm să nu erodăm foarte mult marja adăugată.
Punctele noastre cheie sunt calitatea şi serviciile, chiar dacă în 2019 simţim o prezenţă dură a concurenţei prin preţuri mici. Avem clienţi care cunosc calitatea produsului nostru, dar, în acelaşi timp, clienţi care acordă mai multă importanţă preţului şi pentru care trebuie să luptăm mai mult pentru a-i păstra.
Industria metalurgică a fost întotdeauna o piaţă ciclică, după o perioadă de creştere uşoară, ne aşteptăm la corecţii la sfârşitul anului 2019 şi în 2020, dar încercăm să menţinem aceste ajustări într-un interval rezonabil, deoarece menţinerea unei cote de piaţă este importantă în industria oţelului, nu doar rezultatele.
Produsele Donalam ajung în cea mai mare parte a Europei, vrem să fim bine reprezentaţi peste tot.
În ultimele luni, Donalam a creat un joint-venture împreună cu grupul german GMH, deoarece ambele grupuri au o filosofie comună de optimizare a proceselor şi a activelor lor şi au aceeaşi voinţă de a-şi extinde oferta de produse.
Pe termen scurt, obiectivul este să dezvoltam produse, bazându-ne pe optimizarea ultimelor investiţii în finisarea şi tratarea termică a oţelurilor şi transformarea în profiluri rotunde de calitate înaltă, iar pe termen mediu obiectivul este să se certifice ambele entităţi pe standardul IATF16949 din industria automotive şi în consecinţă dezvoltarea pieţelor respective.
Grupul GMH va distribui de asemenea, produsele Donalam prin reţeaua lor. Noul concept este de a produce materie primă în Germania, apoi laminarea şi finisarea în România, permiţând să combine cele mai eficiente rute de proces pentru ambele entităţi, procesele interne atât ale celor doua companii cât şi ale clienţilor. În acest fel, produsele vizează sectoarele de activitate cu cele mai înalte cerinţe.
Acestea sunt obiectivele parteneriatului cu un cunoscut producător german care ne conduce cu siguranţă la un nivel de clasă înaltă din punct de vedere al calităţii. Acesta este un pas în plus în consolidarea strategiei Donalam ce urmăreşte o valoare adăugată de calitate, după ce o asociere similară a fost semnată cu grupul Voestalpine acum câţiva ani.
GMH este un grup german care activează în industria metalurgică, inginerie mecanică şi industrie energetică cu peste 7000 de angajaţi, format din 20 de companii cu o cifră de afaceri de 2,12 miliarde de euro în 2018.

Donalam Calarasi- sustained efforts to keep the market share. We have recently concluded a strong partnership

Donalam is part of the Italian Beltrame group, with a history of nearly 130 years in the production of rolled steel and special steels, which owns factories in Italy, France, Switzerland and Romania, reaching a consolidated figure of 1.24 billion euros and Ebitda of 115 mil eur in 2018
Following a sustained effort, Donalam Calarasi, achieved remarkable results in 2018, over 2017 and even over budgeted ones. Despite a fierce competition as well as a reserved market we managed to reach a very good level of activity in 2018. We achieved a 9% EBITDA, which is a success for our industry. With an increase in volume, but also by rising prices on the metals market, we have achieved a turnover of 99 million euros and an increase in the relevant market share in Europe. Our results had a very good reflection in cash, this allows us to further develop ourselves, ""said Carlo Beltrame CEO Donalam Calarasi.
Positive results help us to support our next year’s investments. At the end of 2019 we will complete an investment of nearly 4 million euros in a new special steel bar treatment equipment that will allow us to grow our product portfolio and it was funded through Donalam’s cash flow, keeping under control the financial exposure. Investments can lead us to a more cost effective in fact.
Donalam's activity needs to become as efficient and performant as possible, therefore other ambitious investments are planned for next years in order to help our technical component to stay on the market at a level that matters. The future investment plan will allow Donalam to reduce its emission and to produce with minimum footprint. We are obliged to afford this investment to penetrate complicated high-quality application market, to get out from battle field of commodity product where we are no more competitive, and in the future, will be even less competitive from a cost prospective.
Our expenses have increased, the salary increases in the last 2 years, as well as the increases in cost items with an important weight: electricity and gas, which reduce our operational margin. Energy and gas have seen significant increases, I think all industrial producers have seen these increases in the past.
It's hard to compete even with Western European products, as the price of electricity and gas is higher in Romania. The rise in the national minimum wage, as well as the salary increases in the budgetary sector, also affected wage increases in Donalam.
We have reached a sales level of 125,000 tons in 2018 compared to 108,000 tons in 2017. We hope to maintain our sales volume constantly in 2019, we're still playing to not erode the gross added margin.
Our Key points are quality and service, even if in 2019 we feel a tough presence of competition at low prices. We have customers who know the quality of our product, but at the same time customers who give more importance to the price and for whom we must fight more to keep them. The steel industry has always been a cyclical market, after a period of slight growth, we expect corrections at end of 2019-2020, but we are trying to keep these adjustments within a reasonable range, as maintaining a market share is important in the steel industry, not just the results.
Donalam products reach most of Europe, we want to be well represented everywhere.
Within the latest months a joint venture has been created by Donalam together with German group GMH, as both groups share a common philosophy of optimising processes and facilities and have the same will to enlarge their offers. For short term the goal is to develop products, based on optimising latest investments in finishing and heat treatment for engineering steel in round and square (rcs) profiles and for medium term the goal is to qualify both entities for IATF16949 standard in automotive industry and to develop markets accordingly. The GMH commercial network will also distribute Donalam’s products through their network
The new steel concept is producing raw material in Germany, then rolling and finishing in Romania, allowing to combine the most efficient process routes from both sides, internal processes of both companies and of customers too. This way, products are targeting the most demanding application sectors. These are the goals of a partnership with a well-known German producer that certainly is leading us to high class level in terms of quality.
This is a further step in the consolidation of Donalam’s strategy to the pursue of quality value added, after a similar joint-venture was signed with Voestalpine group a couples of year ago
The GMH is a German group acting in Steel industry, Mechanical Engineering and Energy Industry with more than 7000 employees, consisting in 20 companies with a turnover of 2.12Bilion Eur in 2018.
