      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- A proposal to rezone thousands of acres for lime rock mining in Lee County did not pass Wednesday.</p>
      <p>County commissioners voted 5-0 in favor of the hearing examiner's recommendation against the rezone.</p>
      <p>The proposed area was off of Corkscrew Road and State Road 82. It's a little over 4200 acres.</p>
      <p>Several people showed up to the hearing wearing red to show their objection to the rezone. Those people were concerned about pollution, environmental degradation, and traffic dangers from mining trucks.</p>
