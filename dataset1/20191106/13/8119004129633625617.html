        <b>Masked Islamic State militants attacked a border post on the Tajik-Uzbek border overnight, triggering a gun battle that killed 15 of the militants, a guard and a policeman, Tajik authorities said on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was no immediate announcement from the militant group, which has claimed responsibility for a series of assaults in Tajikistan in recent months.</p>
      <p>Five of the gunmen were captured after the attack on the Tajik side of the border, 50 km southwest of the capital Dushanbe, Tajikistan's National Security Committee said.</p>
      <p>It released a photograph showing the badly burned bodies of three men in black military-style outfits, lying on the ground next to a wrecked car.</p>
      <p>The committee said the gunmen had entered the former Soviet republic earlier this month via its border with Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Western cyclists in Tajikistan last year and for a prison riot in May.</p>
