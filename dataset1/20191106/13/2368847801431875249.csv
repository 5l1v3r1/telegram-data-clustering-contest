貿易戰風險降溫 金價失守1500美元關口

06 Nov 2019, 13:44

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】在美中貿易第一階段協議準備簽訂前夕，美股近日連創歷史新高。代表股市波動風險的VIX恐慌指數也跌到13附近，顯示市場積極追求風險資產、捨棄避險資產，造成黃金12月期貨週二（5日）大跌1.69%至1,485美元/盎司，再度跌破1,500美元心理關口。
週二金價重挫的導火線或許是美國供應管理協會（ISM）公布的10月非製造業採購經理人指數，由前月的52.6%跳升到54.7%，優於經濟學家預測的53.5%。該數據顯示美國經濟趨穩，美聯儲已沒進一步降息的急迫性。
就中長線而言，對於貴金屬等避險資產的投機客來說，最大的利空莫過於地緣政治紛擾消除、經濟重新回到正常的增長軌道，以及美聯儲一段時間不再降息刺激經濟，而這三件事情目前正在發生，這也造就了週二金價回挫的遠因。
關於第一階段協議，媒體據報中方希望美國能取消部分已經課徵的關稅作為條件，部分專家估計美方可能些微讓步，且很可能11月就簽約。
彭博社消息稱習近平可能飛往美國與川普簽約。美國商務部長羅斯（Wilbur Ross）也暗示解禁美商對華為的供貨。若果如此，今年投資人最擔心的貿易戰風險將大幅降低。
誠如美國億萬富豪、凱雷集團（Carlyle Group）創辦人魯賓斯坦（David Rubenstein）所說，第一階段協議足以讓人們感覺貿易戰對經濟已不再是個大問題。
另一方面，向來紛擾的中東局勢，最近也變得靜悄悄，伊斯蘭國的首腦巴格達迪被美軍擊斃的消息更從源頭阻斷了中東一大亂源。金價缺乏這類負面消息的刺激，讓投機客萌生退意。
美聯儲在10月30日今年第三次降息之後，開始釋出一段時間暫停降息的訊息，而且美國公布的第三季GDP增長1.9%，遠優於預期的1.6%附近，顯示美國經濟在貿易戰的衝擊下仍然堅挺。金價失去了美聯儲降息的誘因，部分避險的投資客也被迫撤出。
摩根大通預期2020年美聯儲或許還有一次降息的機會，認為美聯儲一段時間的停止降息將導致金價下跌的風險，但卻估計明年第四季金價仍可漲到1,800美元/盎司。
金價今年8月在貿易戰紛擾的過程中最高曾漲到1,566美元/盎司，至今約回挫5%，但全年仍有15.6%的漲幅，由於長期技術面已扭轉為上升形態，許多專家仍然堅信金價未來幾年可突破2011年的1,923美元歷史高峰。

The risk of trade war has cooled down. The price of gold has fallen below the $1,500 mark.

06 Nov 2019, 13:44

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] On the eve of the preparation of the first phase of the US-China trade agreement, US stocks hit a record high in recent days. The VIX panic index, which represents the risk of stock market volatility, also fell to around 13, indicating that the market is actively pursuing risky assets and abandoning safe-haven assets, causing gold December futures to fall 1.69% to $1,485/oz on Tuesday (5th), once again falling below A psychological threshold of $1,500.
The trigger for the gold price tumble on Tuesday may be the October Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index released by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which jumped from 52.6% in the previous month to 54.7%, better than economists' forecast of 53.5%. The data shows that the US economy is stabilizing and the Fed has no urgency to cut interest rates further.
As far as the medium and long-term line is concerned, for speculators of safe-haven assets such as precious metals, the biggest negative is that geopolitical disturbances are eliminated, the economy returns to normal growth, and the Fed does not cut interest rates for a while to stimulate the economy. Something is happening now, which also contributed to the far-reaching reasons for the fall in gold prices on Tuesday.
Regarding the first phase of the agreement, the media reported that the Chinese side hopes that the United States can cancel some of the tariffs already enacted as conditions, and some experts estimate that the US may make a slight concession, and it is likely to sign in November.
Bloomberg News said Xi Jinping may fly to the United States to sign with Trump. US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross also hinted that the US business will be banned from supply. If this is the case, the risk of trade wars that investors are most worried about this year will be greatly reduced.
As David Rubenstein, the founder of the US billionaire and Carlyle Group, said, the first phase of the agreement is enough to make people feel that the trade war is no longer a big problem for the economy.
On the other hand, the situation in the Middle East, which has always been confusing, has recently become quiet. The news that the head of the Islamic State, Baghdadi, was killed by the US military has blocked a large source of chaos in the Middle East from the source. The lack of such negative news in the price of gold has caused speculators to retreat.
After the third rate cut this year on October 30, the Fed began to release a period of time to suspend interest rate cuts, and the US announced third-quarter GDP growth of 1.9%, far better than the expected 1.6%, indicating that the US economy is in trade war The impact is still strong. The price of gold lost the incentive for the Fed to cut interest rates, and some of the safe-haven investors were forced to withdraw.
JPMorgan Chase expects that the Fed may have another chance to cut interest rates in 2020. It believes that the Fed’s suspension of interest rate cuts for a period of time will lead to a risk of falling gold prices, but it is estimated that the price of gold will still rise to $1,800 per ounce in the fourth quarter of next year.
In August, the price of gold rose to a maximum of US$1,566 per ounce during the trade war. It has fallen by 5% so far, but it still has a 15.6% increase throughout the year. As the long-term technical situation has turned into a rising pattern, many experts still It is firmly believed that the price of gold will break through the historical peak of US$1,923 in 2011 in the next few years.
