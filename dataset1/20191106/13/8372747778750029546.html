      <p>Alex, he'll take "charity" for $10,000.</p>
      <p>Avi Gupta <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/2019/teen-tournament">crushed a teen "Jeopardy!" tournament </a>this summer, taking home $100,000, and he's donating some of his winnings to cancer research in honor of his new buddy Alex Trebek.</p>
      <p>In time for Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month, the 18-year-old donated more than $10,000 for pancreatic cancer studies at the Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.</p>
      <p>Gupta's donation will also promote early detection of pancreatic cancer -- something <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/entertainment/alex-trebek-cancer-psa/index.html">Trebek himself advocated for</a> in an October PSA. The legendary host announced his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/entertainment/alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer/index.html">stage 4 pancreatic cancer</a> diagnosis in March.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/avigupta33/status/1190438157763928069">Twitter clip</a> , the Columbia University freshman said he was inspired to give by Trebek, who hosted the June tournament he conquered and is "someone I looked up to my whole life."</p>
      <p>Ever the brainiac, Gupta sneaked a math reference into his gift: $10,314. Those last three digits are a reference to pi, a number he told <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/local-teen-jeopardy-champ-donates-more-than-10k-to-ohsus-knight-cancer-institute">CNN affiliate KATU</a> represents his "lifelong love of learning and math and science" that eventually led to his "Jeopardy!" win.</p>
      <p>Trebek <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/17/entertainment/alex-trebek-chemotherapy/index.html">resumed chemotherapy treatments </a>in September, but he's still hosting the "Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions" airing this week.</p>
      <p>He's appeared on the show for 35 years. In October, Trebek said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/07/us/alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer-hosting-trnd/index.html">he'll continue to host</a> it as long as his "skills do not diminish," though he may quit if his condition worsens.</p>
