Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac has announced a 26-member squad on Wednesday for India's upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier games against Afghanistan and Oman. ATK goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem, who represented India in the U-17 World Cup, earned his first senior team call-up.

Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac has announced a 26-member squad on Wednesday for India's upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier games against Afghanistan and Oman (both away from home). ATK goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem earned his first senior team call-up from Stimac. Dheeraj was part of India's U-17 team which played in the World Cup in 2017. He has also been a part of the U-23 national side.
Dheeraj, however, has not yet played for ATK this season as the Kolkata-based side has opted for Arindam Bhattacharya in goal for its first three matches. His inclusion meant Kamaljit Singh was dropped from the squad. Among other notable absentees from the previous camp were Sandesh Jhingan (defender), Nikhil Poojary, Halicharan Narzary (both midfielders) and Balwant Singh (forward).
Jhingan is recovering from an ACL injury and was thus sidelined. Midfielders Pronay Halder, Seiminlen Doungel, Jackichand Singh, who were all missing in the previous probables list for the Bangladesh clash, secured a spot in the team this time.
India will play Afghanistan on November 14 and face Oman five days later. Placed in Group E, India is fourth on the points table with two points gained from draws against Qatar (0-0) and Bangladesh (1-1) after losing their first match against Oman (1-2).

The 26-member squad:

Goalkeepers:  Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Amrinder Singh, Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem
Defenders: Pritam Kotal, Nishu Kumar, Rahul Bheke, Anas Edathodika, Narender, Adil Khan, Sarthak Golui, Subhasish Bose, Mandar Rao Dessai
Midfielders: Udanta Singh, Jackichand Singh, Seiminlen Doungel, Raynier Fernandes, Vinit Rai, Sahal Abdul Samad, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Brandon Fernandes, Ashique Kuruniyan
Forwards: Sunil Chhetri, Manvir Singh, Farukh Choudhary.
