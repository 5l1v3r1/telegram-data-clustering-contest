      <p><b>Dear E. Jean:</b> I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be in love. I’m a 27-year-old woman who’s been single for years. I’ve tried online dating and met some nice guys, but since my last serious relationship ended, I’ve felt absolutely nothing—not even a twinge of romance. One gentleman in particular was fantastic. However, no matter what we tried, nothing. This dreadful feeling has been made worse with the loss of my grandmother and my cat in the same month, which really sent me into a tailspin. I feel like I have an icy, black heart. It seems like such a ridiculous question, but what can I do to make myself feel again?—<i>Frozen</i></p>
      <p><b>Frozen, My Goose Bump</b>: Who said you must be in love with a man right this very minute? Leave that heart of yours in the freezer, girl! Revel in your liberty. It’s an Ask E. Jean law: One woman’s freedom from love is the next woman’s torment from love. This law, however, does not pertain to kittens. Kittens are alien geniuses. Kittens hold the secret to “making yourself feel again.” And one is waiting for you at a shelter.</p>
