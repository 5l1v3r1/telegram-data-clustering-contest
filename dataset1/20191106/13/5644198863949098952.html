      <p>PHNOM PENH: Self-exiled Cambodian opposition party founder Sam Rainsy said on Wednesday (Nov 6) he will return to the country on Saturday <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cambodia-seeks-opposition-leader-s-arrest-amid-eu-sanctions-threat-11175978">to face arrest</a> after a mass crackdown at home on opposition activists and detention of members of his banned party by Malaysian authorities.</p>
      <p>"I will depart from Paris on Thursday November 7. I will arrive in Bangkok on Friday November 8 to be ready to enter #Cambodia on Saturday November 9," Rainsy tweeted along with a photo of his airplane ticket.</p>

      <p>He is likely, however, to be detained in Thailand, which recently turned away the vice president of the banned Cambodia National Rescue Party when she flew into Bangkok's main international airport.</p>
      <p>Rainsy fled to France four years ago following a conviction for criminal defamation in which he was ordered to pay US$1 million in compensation. He also faces a five-year prison sentence in a separate case.</p>
