按揭成數：綠表、白表的分別
居屋申請分為綠表及白表兩種配額，兩者的入息及資產限額及最高按揭成數都不相同。現時合資格的綠表申請人士，最高按揭額為總樓價的95%，即九成半按揭；而合資格的白表申請者，最高按揭額為90%，即最高9成。

擔保人是政府 按揭年期怎計算？
由首次出售日起計，房委會會擔保所有居屋30年。例如你所購買的二手公屋出售期為6年前，政府的擔保期就是24年。若擔保期內如業主斷供，政府會還錢給銀行。
銀行按揭年期一般會以擔保期計算，綠表、白表和白居二的最高按揭年期為25年。假設購買一手居屋單位，按揭年期則為25年；假若你購買的居屋單位離出售期6年，最高按揭還款年期則為24年。
然而，近年銀行批出居屋按揭時到有彈性，有時能批出年期較長的按揭貸款。例如單位樓齡只要不超過20，亦可獲批25年的按揭還款期。

按揭批核或需做壓力測試
由於居屋申請人在入表申請居屋時，房委會已會在其入息及資產上作審批。故理論上，在申請按揭時，毋須受銀行的「壓力測試」所限制（即「加3厘」的按揭測試）。
不過，這也非必然，因為在房署的申請條款中列明：「按揭條款以有關銀行或財務機構的最終批准作實」，而「壓力測試」的主導權在於銀行一方。若銀行發現按揭申請人的經濟能力負擔過重，或同樣會要求進行壓力測試，最終令申請人按揭難以獲批。又或者，如二手未補價居屋的樓齡達20年或以上，便須視乎銀行的做法，或需進行壓力測試。
假若已過30年擔保期，按揭批核方法則和私樓相同，若不過壓力測試便需擔保人。

房協、房委會居屋按揭大不同
不論綠表還是白表，最多可按九成，（房協提供的30%按揭擔保，以及金管樂規定最高的60%按揭成數），而且兩表均須進行壓力測試。
按揭利率：新居屋申請只能承造P按
在官方的規定下，無論是白表或綠表的居屋申請人，均只能申請以銀行「最優惠利率」所計算的按揭計劃，即俗稱的「P按」。居屋申請人通常不能承造「H按」。因應香港銀行利率尚處穩定，所以，只許申請P按的規定，相信不會對申請人帶來財政困難。
銀行加息 供款額即升
由於居屋申請人只能申請P按，因而會受到香港銀行的加息週期所影響，如目前各大銀行的最優惠利率已調升。香港現時的最優惠利率按揭則多為年利率2.375%。如滙豐銀行、渣打銀行及花旗銀行等，與一般私人物業按揭無異。若香港銀行根據環球經濟環境而加息，使用P按的居屋業主，每月的供款額亦會上升。
需通過「供款入息限制」
買居屋申請按揭時，申請人均需通過「供款入息限制」審查，即供款不可超過「個人或家庭月入的50%」。換言之，儘管綠白表的最高按揭成數高達9成半及9成，可是借貸額愈高，每月供款愈多，供款入息比例的門檻便愈高。
以何文田冠德苑，定價529萬元的「樓王」為例，如果白表申請人申請9成按揭，在以25年攤還，以實際按息為2.375%計，月供約為21,923.64元。即申請人月入需超過54,666.45元，才可通過「供款入息限制」。
未補地價轉按加按 須房委會批準
現時政府對於未補地價的居屋均有嚴格財務安排，如果在任何情況下（包括已過5年的禁售期）未補地價，想要加按或轉按，均須獲房委會書面同意。根據過往案例，如戶主在醫療、家庭開支方面，需錢應急，才可獲批準。

[Home Ownership Mortgage Guide] What are the differences between the green and white watches? Stress test, guarantor, number, year explanation
06 Nov 2019, 10:00 by the property market
The requirements for the number, duration, interest rate and stress test of HOS mortgages are different from those of private buildings. The term of HOS mortgages is also calculated under the government guarantee period (30 years). In 2019, the results of the home ownership of the HOS and the White House II have been released. If you are lucky enough to pick up a house, whether it is a green watch, a white watch or a ""Bai Ju II"", you may have to pass the stress test when you buy a HOS flat. What should I pay attention to when applying for a mortgage? ""Economic Week"" has compiled various precautions for everyone.

Mortgage number: the difference between green and white
HOS applications are divided into green and white forms. The income and asset limits and the maximum number of mortgages are different. At present, the maximum number of mortgages for eligible Green Form applicants is 95% of the total property price, that is, 90% of the mortgages. For eligible whitelist applicants, the maximum mortgage amount is 90%, that is, the highest 90%.

The guarantor is the government. How is the mortgage period calculated?
From the date of first sale, the Housing Authority will guarantee all HOS flats for 30 years. For example, the second-hand public housing you bought was sold for 6 years, and the government's guarantee period is 24 years. If the owner fails to supply the goods during the guarantee period, the government will pay back the bank.
The bank mortgage period is generally calculated based on the guarantee period. The maximum mortgage period for Green Form, White Form and Baiju II is 25 years. Assuming a first-hand HOS flat, the mortgage period is 25 years. If you buy a HOS flat for 6 years from the sale period, the maximum mortgage repayment period is 24 years.
However, in recent years, banks have been flexible in granting HOS mortgages, and sometimes they can grant longer mortgage loans. For example, if the unit age is not more than 20, it can also be granted a mortgage repayment period of 25 years.

Mortgage approval or stress test
As HOS applicants apply for HOS flats, the HA will approve the income and assets. In theory, when applying for a mortgage, it is not subject to the ""stress test"" of the bank (ie ""additional 3%"" mortgage test).
However, this is not inevitable because it is stated in the application terms of the HD: ""The mortgage terms are based on the final approval of the relevant bank or financial institution"" and the ""stress test"" is dominated by the bank. If the bank finds that the mortgage applicant's financial ability is overburdened, or will also require a stress test, the applicant's mortgage will eventually be difficult to obtain approval. Or, if the age of second-hand unpaid HOS flats is 20 years or more, it will depend on the bank's practices or stress tests.
If the 30-year guarantee period has passed, the mortgage approval method is the same as that of the private building. If the stress test is required, the guarantor is required.

Housing Society and Housing Authority Home Ownership Mortgage
Regardless of the green or white form, up to 90% (the 30% mortgage guarantee provided by the HS and the highest 60% mortgage issued by the HS), and both tables must be stress tested.
Mortgage Rate: New Home Ownership Application can only be built by P
Under the official requirement, applicants for HOS flats, whether they are white or green, can only apply for the mortgage scheme calculated by the bank's ""best interest rate"", which is commonly known as ""P-press"". Home Owners' Applicants are usually unable to create ""H Presses"". In view of the fact that Hong Kong bank interest rates are still stable, it is only possible to apply for P-based regulations. I believe that it will not bring financial difficulties to applicants.
Bank interest rate increase
As HOS applicants can only apply for P-based, they will be affected by the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks. For example, the best lending rates of major banks have been raised. The current best interest rate mortgage in Hong Kong is mostly 2.375% per annum. For example, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank are no different from ordinary private mortgages. If Hong Kong banks raise interest rates according to the global economic environment, the monthly contribution of homeowners using P will also increase.
Need to pass the ""contribution income limit""
When applying for a mortgage for a HOS flat, the applicant is required to pass the ""Contribution Income Limit"" review, that is, the contribution cannot exceed 50% of the monthly income of the individual or family. In other words, although the maximum number of mortgages for green and white watches is as high as 95% and 90%, the higher the loan amount, the more the monthly contributions will be, and the higher the threshold for the contribution income ratio.
For example, Ho Man Tin Kwan Tak Court, which is priced at 5.29 million yuan, is a case. If a white form applicant applies for a 90% mortgage, it will be repaid in 25 years. The actual interest rate is 2.375%, and the monthly supply is about 21,923.64. yuan. That is, the applicant's monthly inflow needs to exceed $54,666.45 before the ""contribution income limit"" can be passed.
Unreplenished land price transfer and additional approval
At present, the Government has strict financial arrangements for HOS flats which are not replenished. If there is no land premium under any circumstances (including the five-year lock-up period) and you want to add or re-press, you must obtain a written copy from the HA. agree. According to past cases, if the head of household is in need of money for emergency medical and family expenses, it can be approved.
