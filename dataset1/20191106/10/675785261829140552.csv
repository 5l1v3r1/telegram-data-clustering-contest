What channel is Arsenal vs Vitoria on? TV and live stream information
Arsenal are facing off against Vitoria Guimaraes on the unusual Europa League game night of Thursday
06 Nov 2019, 10:30 by Sam Fletcher
Arsenal are back in Europa League action as they face bottom of the group Vitoria SC - but on a bizarre Wednesday game night.
After a disappointing draw at home to Wolves on Saturday, the Europa League comes as a welcome distraction for Unai Emery where qualification to the knockout stages can be all but confirmed with a win.
Last season’s finalists have won each of their three opening Group F fixtures and have kept a clean sheet in two of them.
Yet, undoubtedly, their most difficult European fixture this season came against Wednesday’s opponents when the Gunners twice had to come from behind to take all three points.
Here’s everything you need to know ahead of the match...
