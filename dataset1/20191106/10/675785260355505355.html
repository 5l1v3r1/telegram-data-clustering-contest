      <h1>Zinedine Zidane responds to claim he wants Gareth Bale gone amid Raheem Sterling link</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Bale has reportedly had a strained relationship with Zinedine Zidane but the Frenchman wants the winger to stay at Real Madrid</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:42:45+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane has told Gareth Bale that he wants him to stay at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in January - with the Spanish giants linked with a swap deal with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> for Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Real are preparing a Â£70million plus Bale deal to try and lure Sterling to the Bernabeu, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/real-madrid-preparing-70million-plus-20808726">according to reports.</a></p>
      <p>The Welshman was also close to a summer move to Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning but the deal was pulled at the eleventh hour - with league rivals Shanghai Shenhua now interested.</p>
      <p>But Real manager Zidane has insisted that he wants the winger to remain in the Spanish despite regular rumours of a bust-up between the duo.</p>

      <p>"Everybody is saying I don't want Bale here and I want him to leave in January. That's nonsense," Zidane said.</p>
      <p>"People can talk about me, about what I do, but nobody can put fake words on my mouth.</p>
      <p>"Of course, we cannot have the same bond with everybody but I've never had any problem with Gareth, even after what happened during last summer when supposedly he was leaving.</p>

      <p>"This is the situation: he's here, and I'm happy because the player is very good."</p>
      <p>"So yes, I want Gareth to stay here with us until the end of the season. That's very clear."</p>
      <p>Bale hasn't played since scoring in Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier with Croatia on October 13 - with his last outing for Real coming on October 5.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has been struggling with a calf injury but was called up to Ryan Giggs' squad for Wales clashes with Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>And Zidane has stayed cool on Bale's inclusion in the squad. The Frenchman said: "If his national team, his country, called him up it is their right. It is a FIFA international break and there is nothing we can do about it.</p>
      <p>"The player only wants to recover. There are not doubts about it.</p>
      <p>"He's the one suffering the most. We will see how the week goes and what's going to happen with his national team, to know if he's ready or not."</p>
