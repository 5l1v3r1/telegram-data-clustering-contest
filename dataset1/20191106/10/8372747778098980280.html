      <p>More than 11,000 researchers from around the world on Tuesday issued a grim warning of the "untold suffering" that will be <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/09/28/world/climate-change-youth-activists-greta-thunberg-world-leaders-inaction/index.html">caused by climate change</a> if humanity doesn't change its ways.</p>
      <p>The group said that as scientists, they have the "moral obligation to tell it like it is."</p>
      <p>Phoebe Barnard, one of the lead authors of the report and the chief science and policy officer at the Conservation Biology Institute, a nonprofit science group, told CNN the report makes it clear "there's no more wiggle room" for policymakers.</p>
      <p>"Posterity will remember them badly for dismissing climate change as a serious threat to our civilization," she said.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time thousands of academics united to urge people to take action on climate change. More than <a href="https://cnn.com/2017/11/14/health/scientists-warn-humanity/index.html">16,000 scientists from 184 countries</a> published a letter in 2017, warning that "human beings and the natural world are on a collision course."</p>
      <p>The latest report <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806">was published in BioScience</a> , a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The scientists, who come from over 150 countries, said the climate crisis is "closely linked to excessive consumption of the wealthy lifestyle."</p>
      <p>Echoing the words of <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/10/11/us/greta-thunberg-denver-climate-strike/index.html">teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg</a> , the scientists have criticized policymakers for failing to take an action.</p>
      <p>"Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament," they said.</p>
      <p>They listed six key issues that need to be addressed if humanity wants to prevent the most catastrophic scenarios.</p>
      <p>These include replacing fossil fuels, cutting the emissions of climate pollutants such as methane and soot, eating less meat, restoring and protecting ecosystems, building a carbon-free economy and stabilizing population growth by investing into family-planning services and girls education.</p>
      <p>Barnard said the changes shouldn't be seen as "sacrifices," but as a way of "transforming things that we have found stressful."</p>
      <p>"Everything from road rage and congestion and dirty air," she said.</p>
