06 Nov 2019, 10:19 by 張詠淇
林宥嘉帶著剛發行的新單曲〈少女〉來朝聖少女最多的節目TVBS歡樂台《女人我最大》，分享「最愛的少女穿搭」，他透露自己對服裝造型很有興趣。他身穿卡其色的高領上衣加上焦糖色褲子，搭一件復古風的外套，Kevin老師大讚林宥嘉的搭配是今年秋冬的時尚指標。看到換穿少女裝扮的林姿佑跟陳予新，林宥嘉笑說：「可以看到最多少女的地方就是《女人我最大》！」
主持人藍心湄問林宥嘉：「你心中的少女條件是什麼？」林宥嘉表示：「不管幾歲都要有一顆少女的心。」還表示今天到女人我最大，有留被老師改造的空間，讓Kevin老師立刻從衣櫃挑出一件格子西裝外套，請林宥嘉試穿，大家都公認這種oversize復古風，非常適合林宥嘉。
沒想到脫下外套，剩下高領貼身毛衣，林宥嘉搞笑的說：「我這樣會激凸嗎，我很擔心」，立刻讓現場來賓笑成一片。當Kevin老師拿出一件深V的上衣介紹時，林宥嘉馬上說：「這個爸爸看了會生氣。」藍心湄跟他說：「沒幾年，你女兒也會穿這樣跟你說他有男朋友了。」林宥嘉抓著頭回：「不行不行，什麼男朋友！」
