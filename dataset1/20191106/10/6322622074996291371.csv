亚股跟随美国股指期货 马股收低
06 Nov 2019, 10:53 by Tan Xue Ying
（吉隆坡6日讯）市场对中美贸易协议的乐观日益高涨，亚洲股市跟随美国股指期货，马股跌幅收窄，全日下跌3.49点或0.22%。
闭市时，富时隆综指收于1603.25点，盘中曾跌至1597.18点。美国股指期货收复失地，截至5时31分，E-迷你道指微起8点或0.03%，至27429点。
路透社报道，中国正在推动美国总统Donald Trump取消更多关税，作为可能在本月签署的中美第一阶段贸易协议的一部份内容。
Inter-Pacific证券研究主管冯廷秀向theedgemarkets.com表示，包括马股在内的亚股早前跟随美国股指期货走低，出现谨慎套利。
“总之，对于亚股来说，今天更像是‘下跌的一天’，而不是‘上升的一天’。”
马股全日有27亿1000万股，值17亿2000万令吉成交，因令吉汇率走强似乎决定了马股的交投动态。
主要下跌股包括顶级手套（Top Glove Corp Bhd）和国油化学（Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd）等综指成分股，这可能因为投资者评估令吉升值对这些美元盈利公司的影响。
顶级手套跌13仙或2.89%，报4.37令吉，而国油化学收于7.60令吉，跌10仙或1.3%。
顶级手套曾跌至4.35令吉，因为根据安联星展研究，该公司有可能从综指名单除名。
截稿时，令吉兑美元报4.1390。过去一年，令吉贬至4.2280最低位后，一直走强至目前的水平。

Asian stocks follow US stock index futures
06 Nov 2019, 10:53 by Tan Xue Ying
KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 6): The market is increasingly optimistic about Sino-US trade agreements. Asian stock markets follow US stock index futures. The decline in the FBM KLCI narrowed and fell 3.49 points or 0.22%.
At the close of the market, the FBM KLCI closed at 1603.25 points and fell to 1597.18 points in intraday trading. US stock index futures regained lost ground. As of 5:31, the E-mini road index rose slightly by 8 points or 0.03% to 27,429 points.
Reuters reported that China is pushing US President Donald Trump to cancel more tariffs as part of the China-US first-phase trade agreement that may be signed this month.
Inter-Pacific Securities Research Director Feng Tingxiu told theedgemarkets.com that Asian stocks, including the Malaysian stock market, had followed the US stock index futures lower and had a cautious arbitrage.
“In short, for Asian stocks, today is more like a 'falling day' than a 'rise day'.”
The Malaysian stock market has 2.7 billion shares and a turnover of RM1.72 billion. The strong exchange rate of the ringgit seems to determine the trading dynamics of the Malaysian stock market.
Major downtrends include the KLCI and the Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, which may be due to investors' assessment of the impact of the appreciation of the ringgit on these dollar-profit companies.
Top gloves fell 13 sen or 2.89% to RM4.37, while Petronas Chemical closed at RM7.60, down 10 sen or 1.3%.
Top gloves have fallen to RM4.35, as the company may be removed from the KLCI list according to the Allianz DBS study.
At the time of writing, the ringgit reported 4.1390 against the US dollar. In the past year, after the ringgit reached the lowest level of 4.2280, it has been stronger to the current level.
