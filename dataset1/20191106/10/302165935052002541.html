      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 6 — Thailand will not allow Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy to transit through the kingdom in a bid to return to Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha said today.</p>
      <p>Rainsy, who has lived in France since 2015 to avoid jail for convictions he says are politically motivated, has promised a dramatic homecoming on November 9, Cambodia’s Independence Day.</p>
      <p>But Cambodia’s strongman premier Hun Sen has said repeatedly that arrest warrants for his arch-rival have been sent to neighbouring countries and troops deployed at the Thai-Cambodian border to stop his return.</p>
      <p>Prayut confirmed that authorities are on the lookout for Rainsy and any key opposition members.</p>
      <p>“We will not allow anti-government (parties) to use Thailand as a base,” the Thai leader said in an apparent reference to Rainsy’s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).</p>
      <p>The CNRP was dissolved in the lead-up to last year’s heavily criticised elections in Cambodia, which Hun Sen’s party swept, turning the country into a one-party state.</p>
      <p>Since then, key opposition members have fled the country. Police have rounded up dozens of opposition activists in recent weeks ahead of Rainsy’s planned return.</p>
      <p>In neighbouring Thailand, authorities were sent photos of the opposition members and Rainsy — who yesterday posted a Thai Airways stub on social media showing a seat in his name on a Paris to Bangkok flight on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Prayut said authorities have been told to stop him.</p>
      <p>“I do not think he will be able to enter (Thailand),” he said.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia for 34 years, but the CNRP and Rainsy — who analysts say remains a popular symbol for change — are thorns in his side.</p>
      <p>The tensions were on display today when the Cambodian ambassador to Indonesia Hor Nambora stormed a press conference by deputy CNRP leader Mu Sochua — who is also planning to return to Phnom Penh to support Rainsy.</p>
      <p>Organiser Darmawan Triwibowo of pro-democracy NGO Kurawal Foundation said they rebuffed the ambassador’s demands that the “illegal” event be cancelled.</p>
      <p>The embassy later issued a press release calling for Mu Sochua’s arrest and immediate deportation to Cambodia, citing her status as a “fugitive”.</p>
      <p>In Malaysia meanwhile, two opposition activists — one of them an asylum seeker — were detained as they were boarding flights to Thailand, Human Rights Watch’s Phil Robertson told AFP, adding that they will face imprisonment if deported to Cambodia.</p>
      <p>“Freedom of expression and association have been so destroyed in Cambodia that now its diplomats think they can extend their rights-violating tactics overseas,” Robertson said. — AFP</p>
