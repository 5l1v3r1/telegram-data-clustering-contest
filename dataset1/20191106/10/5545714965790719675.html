      <h1>In under a year, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the best-selling fighting game of all time, beating nearly three decades of Street Fighter II history</h1>
      <h2>All the hard work paid off</h2>

      <p>When Sakurai explained his pitch for <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i>, his entire development team was stunned. No one but him thought they could pull it off, but lo and behold, the madman did it.</p>
      <p>It paid off, too, literally, as Nintendo has recently revealed that in under a year, the game <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../nintendo-provides-updated-switch-software-sales-mario-kart-8-deluxe-soars-with-over-19-million-sold-571089.phtml">has shifted 15.71 million units</a> on the Switch alone. Remember, this isn't a confusing "Wii U + 3DS" combined sales situation like the last <i>Smash</i>: this is nearly 16 million copies on <b>just</b> the Switch, which has a total userbase <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../the-switch-hits-over-40-million-sold-worldwide-what-will-its-lifetime-sales-be--571001.phtml">of roughly 41 million units</a>. That's an insane reach.</p>
      <p>But what I didn't realize at the time (<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/super-smash-bros-ultimate-best-selling-fighting-game/">and as Digital Trends has pointed out</a>) is that 15.71 million units is enough to catapult <i>Smash Ultimate</i> into the monetary milky way and into the number one spot of "best selling fighting game of all time." In a coveted top five list that now includes three <i>Smash</i> titles (<i>Brawl</i> and the aforementioned confusing <i>Smash 4</i> for two systems), <i>Smash Ultimate</i> has beaten <i>Super Street Fighter II</i>'s choke hold number of 15.5 million units, a record that's been pumped up since the early '90s through multiple iterations of the game.</p>
      <p>This figure also makes <i>Smash</i> the most popular fighting game series of all time with nearly 54 million copies sold, beating out big contenders like <i>Street Fighter</i> (roughly 43 million) and <i>Mortal Kombat </i>(roughly 49 million). "Not a fighting game" indeed.</p>
