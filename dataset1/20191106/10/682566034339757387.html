      <p>Cape Town - <b>Mamelodi Sundowns</b> will be looking to return to winning ways when they face <b>Baroka </b>at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>The match gets underway at 19:30.</p>
      <p>Sundowns are coming off the back of a 2-0 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs in their last Absa Premiership encounter.</p>
      <p>A win would have seen the Brazilians move to the top of the table but Pitso Mosimane's now sit five points adrift of pace-setters Chiefs in second position having played a game less.</p>
      <p>Mosimane's men bounced back from that defeat to the Amakhosi with a penalty shootout victory over Chippa United in the quarter-finals of the Telkom Knockout.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bakgaga have had a full week and a half to recover having played their last fixture on October 27 when they lost 1-0 to AmaZulu at home.</p>
      <p>As a result, Wedson Nyirenda's side occupy 14th position and with eight points from nine games after a struggle to the start of their season.</p>
      <p>Former Ajax Cape Town striker Prince Nxumalo has joined Baroka as a free agent after parting ways with Bidvest Wits before the transfer window closed in August.</p>
      <p>And Nxumalo could make his debut as Baroka are desperate for more attacking impetus up front, with the Limpopo-based side having only scored six goals in the league this season.</p>
      <p>Sundowns won 2-1 the last time the sides met back in April in the Absa Premiership.</p>
