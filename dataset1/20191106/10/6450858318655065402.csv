Xiaomi will this morning unveil Mi Note 10 and Redmi Note 8T during a global launch event in Madrid, Spain, at 10.30am local time (9.30am GMT).
The new Mi Note 10 is notable for being the first to use Samsung's 108Mp ISOCELL Bright HMX camera sensor, which is one of five lenses on the smartphone's rear, featuring 5x optical zoom, 50x digital zoom and a 10x hybrid zoom.
The level of detail promised by this lens is truly incredible, with its zoom functionality teased in Xiaomi's promo video below.



The four other lenses on Mi Note 10's penta-lens primary camera include a 12Mp portrait lens, a 20Mp ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8Mp telephoto lens, and a 2Mp macro lens that can shoot at just 1.5m distance. The headline 108Mp lens is capable of incredible detail at 12032x9024 pixels.
If you're wondering how we can be so sure about the specifications of its camera, know that Mi Note 10 launched yesterday in China as the Mi CC9 Pro.
That phone will retail in China from 2,799 yuan (200 yuan cheaper than Mi 9, or around £479 in the UK) with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage in Aurora Green, Midnight Black and Glacier White. There is also an 8GB + 256GB variant of this phone, with both featuring a 6.47in AMOLED display and a huge 5,260mAh battery with 30W wired charging.
The live stream of that event has helpfully been uploaded to YouTube by Technical Sane; you can watch it at the bottom of this page, but do note that it is in Chinese.
If you'd rather watch an English stream of the global variant of the same phone, Mi Note 10, Xiaomi has confirmed that it will live stream today's launch event on various platforms including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. We have embedded the Facebook stream at the top of this article.
