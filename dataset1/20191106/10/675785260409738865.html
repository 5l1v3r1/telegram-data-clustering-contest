      <h1>PlayStation 5 leak suggests Overwatch 2 will 'almost certainly' be first game</h1>
      <h2>A new PlayStation 5 rumour indicates that both Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 will ‘almost certainly’ launch on the PS5</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T10:00:32+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>With a launch date of ‘Holiday 2020’, there’s still a pretty long wait before Sony finally unveils its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console.</p>
      <p>But despite this timeline, rumours about the PS5 are already coming thick and fast, with the latest rumour giving us a hint at some of the games for the console.</p>
      <p>The rumour, by <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/diablo_4_and_overwatch_2_are_almost_certainly_ps5_games">Pushsquare</a> , indicates that both Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 will ‘almost certainly’ launch on the PS5.</p>
      <p>Pushsquare points to a recent Diablo-dedicated panel at Blizzcon 2019, where the development team spoke on stage.</p>
      <p>According to Pushsquare, the development team said: “We are not coming anytime soon, not even Blizzard soon.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, speaking to VG247, game director Jeff Kaplan said that Overwatch 2 could launch at Blizzcon 2020.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have a feeling we’ll be talking about Overwatch 2 again next year at BlizzCon. If that helps.”</p>
      <p>While this doesn’t necessarily show that the games will launch for PS5, it does seem like more than a coincidence that the two games are launching in late 2020, shortly before the launch of the PS5.</p>

      <p>The rumour comes shortly after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sony">Sony</a> finally confirmed the name and launch date for its next generation console.</p>
      <p>As expected, the console is called the PlayStation 5 , and will launch in time for ‘Holiday 2020.’</p>

      <p>In a blog about the news, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jim-ryan">Jim Ryan</a> , President and CEO of SIE, said: “Since we originally unveiled our next-generation console in April, we know that there’s been a lot of excitement and interest in hearing more about what the future of games will bring.</p>
      <p>“Today I’m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we’ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.”</p>
      <p>A precise launch date remains unclear.</p>
