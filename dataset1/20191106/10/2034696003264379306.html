      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/elton-john">Elton John</a> has revealed how he feared he wouldn’t be able to perform sober after taking a year-long break to seek treatment for addiction.</p>
      <p>The ‘Rocketman’ icon attended extensive Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in 1990, but admitted he struggled with returning to the stage.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/uncategorized/elton-john-sober-addiction-recovery-1203392566/">Variety’s Recovery Issue</a>: “After I finally surrendered and decided to seek treatment for my addiction, there came a point when I wondered if I would ever go back to work as Elton John again.</p>
      <p>“But at that time, I wasn’t thinking too much about being an artist. I had reached the lowest ebb in my life – the absolute bottom. I hated myself so much. I was consumed with shame. All I wanted to do was get well. I put all of the energy I had left toward my recovery.”</p>

      <p>Elton explained: “When the day arrived, I was terrified, but I did manage to get through the performance. It was the only time I stepped on a stage that year, and I had to do it on my own without the band. In retrospect, I’m glad I went straight in at the deep end… That show gave me confidence to know that I could still perform sober.”</p>
      <p>In order to maintain his new-found sobriety, Elton also attended AA and NA meetings while touring across the globe. He even visited local groups in countries where he didn’t speak the native language, in a bid to feel “grounded”.</p>
      <p>This comes after Elton discussed his battles with drugs and alcohol in recent memoir ‘Me’. The book sees him recalling the time he hijacked<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-hijacked-rolling-stones-gig-while-high-on-cocaine-2555067"> a Rolling Stones show while high on cocaine</a>, as well as the moment when he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-tried-to-give-scruffy-bob-dylan-a-makeover-after-mistaking-him-for-his-gardener-2555242">mistook Bob Dylan for his gardener while high</a> – describing him as “scruffy”.</p>
      <p>Last month, it was also seemingly confirmed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-not-playing-glastonbury-2020-after-all-2560143">Elton will not play Glastonbury next year</a>, after newly announced farewell tour dates in the US seemingly clashed with the Worthy Farm festival.</p>
