單靠一句話　國泰華威豐年5個月賣百戶
06 Nov 2019, 10:51 by 高迪, 高迪
「餘生很貴，不要浪費。」傳真實業董事長王明成說，衝著這一句金句，讓很多人在飛機上看到廣告後，立刻到北投來看「國泰華威豐年」這個案子，讓此案短短幾個月就賣出7成、百戶的好成績。
傳真實業董事長王明成說：「我在房地產界42年，沒有離開過這個行業一天，所以很專業，而且只代銷台北市跟新北市的房子，所以很專注。」
代銷公司幫建商銷售建案，從產品規劃到廣告行銷都要一同參與，王明成也不例外，他很擅長用一句Slogan（口號）讓消費者留下深刻的印象。

以基地位在北投的「國泰華威豐年」為例，他以北投人平均享有43坪綠地、青磺湯、完善的醫療等賣點，想出「餘生很貴，不要浪費」這句話，抓準退休族或追求生活品質的消費客群訴求，讓這個案子除了首購換屋族外，還吸引了從新竹、台中等地買度假宅的高資產族群，另有一成是50歲以上為退休人生提早規劃的。
國泰華威豐年坐落大業路第一排，距離北投站250公尺，908坪基地近6成面積留設空地及綠化，規劃成23、37、43坪三種格局，每坪均價70萬元。
三樓規劃整層的社區會館，結合閱讀區、多功能廚藝教室、日式KTV、親子遊戲室、健身房、運動吧，還有少見的品茗室。


傳真實業董事長王明成喜歡用金句，他說：「不做風口上的豬，寧做會飛的小鳥。風就是趨勢，景氣不來豬會摔死，房地產界的小鳥是自住跟換屋客，賣不好的案子，90％是產品定位不對。」

從北投有國泰巷、有國泰新村的公車站牌，仲介店頭看板喜歡用「國泰格局」來標榜，不難看出國泰建設深耕區域無人能比的品牌能量。睽違40多年國泰再推新案，加上內容好的行銷，負責銷售的傳真實業協理許聖宏表示，目前高樓層去化表現突出，所剩戶數已不多，年底可望順銷進入開工準備。

One word at a time. Cathay Pacific Weifeng has sold 100 stores for 5 months.

""The rest of the life is very expensive, don't waste it."" Wang Mingcheng, chairman of Fax Industry, said that after rushing to the sentence, many people saw the advertisement on the plane and immediately went to Beitou to see the case of ""Cathay Pacific Warwick Year"". In just a few months, the case sold 70% and 100 households.
Wang Mingcheng, Chairman of Fax Industry, said: ""I have not left the industry for a day in the real estate industry for 42 years, so I am very professional and only sell the houses in Taipei and New Taipei City, so I am very focused.""
The agency sells the construction and construction of the case, from product planning to advertising and marketing. Wang Mingcheng is no exception. He is very good at using a Slogan (slogan) to impress consumers.


Cathay Pacific Weinfeng has turned one of the rooms in the sample house into an interest room, which can be painting, crafts... to make the future owner have unlimited imagination. (provided by fax industry)

For example, in the case of Beitou’s “Guotai Huawei Fengnian”, he has an average of 43 ping green land, green sulphur soup, and perfect medical care, and he thinks that “the rest of life is expensive, don’t waste”. In addition to the first purchase of family members, the case also attracted high-income groups who bought holiday homes from Hsinchu and Taichung, and another 10% were over 50 years old. Retirement life is planned early.
Guotai Huawei Fengnian is located in the first row of Daye Road, 250 meters away from Beitou Station, and nearly 60% of the 908-pyeong base is reserved for open space and greening. It is planned to be in three patterns of 23, 37 and 43 pings, with an average price of 700,000 yuan per ping. .
The third floor is planned to be a community hall with a reading area, a multi-functional cooking classroom, a Japanese KTV, a parent-child game room, a gym, a sports bar, and a rare tea room.


Wang Mingcheng, chairman of Fax Industry, likes to use the golden sentence. He said: ""Don't make pigs on the vent, prefer to be a flying bird. The wind is the trend, the boom will not fall, the birds in the real estate industry will live and change. 90% of homeowners, badly sold cases, are wrongly positioned.""

From Beitou, there is Guotai Lane and the bus stop of Guotai New Village. Zhongjie store kanban likes to use the ""Cathay Pacific pattern"" to advertise. It is not difficult to see that Cathay Pacific has built a brand of energy that no one can match. For more than 40 years, Cathay Pacific has pushed new cases, and with good content marketing, Xu Shenghong, the fax industry assistant responsible for sales, said that the current high-floor decentralization performance is outstanding, and the number of households left is not much, and it is expected to be ready for production at the end of the year.
