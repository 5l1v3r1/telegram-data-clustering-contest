隨著秋天漸漸進入尾聲，高緯度較高地區氣溫也逐漸下降，芬蘭海盧奧托島（Hailuoto）海灘卻在近日出現滿滿「冰蛋」的魔幻奇景，「冰蛋海」更綿延長達30公尺，如此壯觀景色不僅吸引當地不少居民朝聖，業餘攝影師馬蒂拉（Risto Mattila）也將其美景上傳至IG，讓許多網友讚嘆不已。
根據《CNN》報導指出，位在波羅的海最北端附近的海盧奧托島，近日該海灘竟出現「冰蛋」奇景，這些冰球緊密的排列堆疊長達30公尺，當地居民特倫傑夫（Tarja Terentjeff）受訪強調，從未見過冰球布滿整個海灘，是相當驚奇的現象。

CNN氣象專家瓊斯（Judson Jones）分析指出，當海岸附近的湍流經過時，會以層層交疊的方式結冰，雖著彼此之間堆疊、推擠，加上沖上海岸時會發生旋轉作用，造成結冰體漸漸打磨成光滑的球體。
此外，芬蘭氣象研究所（FMI）也提出分析，專家法尼奧（Jouni Vainio）解釋冰球相當罕見，但並非超自然的現象，只要在空氣與水接近結凍的環境下，加上淺灘與潮汐間作用影響，就有機會形成「冰蛋」。
如此奇景曝光後引起許多網友關注，紛紛湧入攝影師IG留言，「難以置信的景象！」「令人興奮的大自然奇景。」「像是一堆白色珍珠」「密集恐懼症差點發作…」。
