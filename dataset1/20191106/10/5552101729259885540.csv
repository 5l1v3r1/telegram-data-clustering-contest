八三夭演唱會壓力大　失眠、心悸找上門
06 Nov 2019, 10:36 by 陳于嬙
KKBOX邁向15歲，推出全新串連機制，今（6日）邀請八三夭擔任宣傳大使，近期，八三夭為了11月23日《想見你想見你想見你》台北小巨蛋演唱會進入備戰狀態，或許因壓力大，團員們幾乎都陷入失眠狀態。
團長小橘自從看了郭富城演唱會，激勵自己的好勝心，決定減肥求完美體態，目前已成功瘦身3公斤，但仍因壓力大，晚上睡不好，他說：「我半夜一點上床，到了早上6點還醒著。」為此，他還減少咖啡杯數，從3杯減到1杯。
鼓手阿電則因壓力大，求診中醫院，被診斷出有心悸， 中醫師開了一種「安眠成份」的藥，讓阿電休息時，整個人放鬆，改善了睡眠品質，他覺得醫生不錯，介紹同樣焦慮的吉他手劉逼去看診，醫生也判定劉逼有「心悸」，和阿電症狀不同卻被診斷相同病因，讓劉逼懷疑醫生只是在應付客人。
