The first movie you remember watching


James and the Giant Peach





The Walt Disney Company



The movie that ""ruined"" your childhood

Mission to Mars. I saw it when I was 9 or 10. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I remember crying in the cinema because it was so shit. I hated it so much. I can't remember anything about it, but I hope everyone involved is dead.




Buena Vista Pictures



The movie you would've taken to a desert island


The Prestige





Warner Bros.



The first movie you saw at a movie theatre


Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace





20th Century Fox



The last movie you saw at a movie theatre


The Joker





Warner Bros. Pictures



The funniest movie you’ve ever seen

Warner Bros. Pictures



The scariest movie you've ever seen

I fucking despise scary movies. I see no need for them. I'm a coward. Paranormal Activity fucked me up.




Paramount Pictures



The movie that made you cry hard

Oh Christ, here's a list: Blind Side, Warrior, Click (yes, the Adam Sandler movie), Avengers Endgame, Green Mile, About Time, Marley and Me.




Click (the Adam Sandler movie) / Sony Pictures Releasing



The movie that influenced you the most

Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. I loved Jim Carrey as a kid and he definitely inspired my love to make people laugh.




Ace Ventura / Warner Bros.



The worst movie you've ever seen

Juno. Fuck that movie and fuck everyone who likes it. Fucking abysmal pile of shit.




Fox Searchlight



The best movie you've ever seen

The Dark Knight. No more needs to be said on this one. Incredible.




Warner Bros. Pictures
