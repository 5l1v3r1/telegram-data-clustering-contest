【插畫】不支持我們的人，都是敵人！
06 Nov 2019, 10:30 by 精選轉載


我們想讓你知道的是有些人總把自己放到唯一正確的位置上，看誰都是敵人，看什麼都不順眼，導致堅持己見，不贊同自己的都是錯的，不和自己站在同一陣線的都是有罪的。

歷史總是驚人地相似，從以前到現在，不管是什麼事件，還是什麼政治形態，都會有自己陣營互打的事情發生。
事實上，立場主張跟意識越是強烈，越是容易為了一點小事情和陣營隊友起衝突，包括某部分理解不同、訴求分歧，或是還不夠百分之百信仰堅定，就會有人跳出來，用自以為正確的理論咬死彼此，廝殺一片。
背後的問題，就是那些人總把自己放到唯一正確的位置上，看誰都是敵人，看什麼都不順眼。導致堅持己見，不贊同自己的都是錯的，不和自己站在同一陣線的都是有罪的。
在台灣最需要團結的時候，還不斷把潛在的支持者向外推，那，你就維持你的正確吧。

What we want you to know is that some people always put themselves in the only correct position to see who is the enemy, to see what is not pleasing to the eye, to lead to their own opinions, to disapprove of their own is wrong, not to stand with themselves. The same front is guilty.

History is always strikingly similar. From the past to the present, no matter what the event or political form, there will be things happening in their own camps.
In fact, the more assertive the position and the consciousness, the easier it is to conflict with the camp teammates for a small matter, including a certain part of understanding different, appealing differences, or not enough 100% faith, some people will jump out and use their own thoughts The correct theory kills each other and kills one.
The problem behind them is that those people always put themselves in the only correct position to see who is the enemy and what is not pleasing to the eye. It is wrong to lead to persistence and disapproval of yourself. It is sinful not to stand on the same line with yourself.
When Taiwan needs the most unity, it will continue to push potential supporters out. Then, you will keep your right.
