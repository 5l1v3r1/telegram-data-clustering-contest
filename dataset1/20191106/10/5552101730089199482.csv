從五年級就迷上史蒂芬金　終於拍到《安眠醫生》
06 Nov 2019, 10:02 by 娛樂組
導演麥可弗拉納根在好萊塢是出了名的「迷戀」史蒂芬金，因為當他剛去那邊求發展時，隨身攜帶史蒂芬金的小說《傑羅德遊戲》，逢人就大力推薦、值得拍成電影。終於到了前年，Netflix出資拍出了《傑羅德遊戲》，也讓他終於得到史蒂芬金本人的青睞，讓他有機會籌備《安眠醫生》。
導演麥可弗拉納根從小學五年級就開始著迷史蒂芬金的小說，雖然這個年紀不太適合看恐怖小說或電影，但是史蒂芬金的作品卻完全改變了他看這個世界的方式。麥可說「身為一個膽怯的小孩，在青春期閱讀他的作品，教我學會如何在短時間內勇敢起來，也是我學會塑造虛構角色的練習。我持續不斷閱讀他的作品，一路力爭上游，成為一名別人付我錢拍電影的導演，如今甚至能執導史蒂芬金小說的改編電影，這對我來說還是非常不可思議。」
在《傑羅德遊戲》推出後，史蒂芬金寫信告訴他「很喜歡」，讓他爭取到討論《安眠醫生》翻拍成電影的機會。剛開始史蒂芬金還不是很想談，最後讓他回心轉意的是，除了保證會巧妙地結合小說的情節和經典電影的劇情，導演還賣了關子說：「我要讓8年滴酒不沾的主人翁丹尼慢慢恢復，再讓他坐在全景飯店的酒吧，前面擺著一杯威士忌，他可能會喝，也可能不會喝…。」這讓史蒂芬金也開始好奇起電影會怎麼發展。
眾所皆知，史蒂芬金並不喜歡電影《鬼店》，認為電影把小說裡頭關於傑克如何沉迷於酒精、如何跟心魔拔河的過程，通通刪除了，直接變成一個嚇死觀眾的瘋子。他甚至以「沒有引擎的凱迪拉克」，形容《鬼店》缺乏中心主旨。

因此這次《安眠醫生》的改編，特別花費篇幅解釋主角丹尼，如何像父親一樣面對心魔與誘惑，又如何從酒精成癮者的泥沼中，逐漸找回自我。對於導演麥可的企圖，史蒂芬金說：「他不僅以寬大的心胸，剖析丹尼長大成人後的故事，同時還進一步延續史單利庫柏力克的《鬼店》，呈現更多人性掙扎的內容，成功把電影和小說劇情融合在一起。」
《鬼店》的視覺與美術風格，影響了後代無數恐怖片，導演麥可保留了這些經典的元素，無論是全景飯店的場景、一望無際的走廊、雙胞胎姊妹花鬼魂、酒吧、水晶吊燈的交誼廳等，全部都是重新搭建，卻又在畫面上跟《鬼店》無縫接軌，讓觀眾馬上就感受到一股不寒而慄的氣氛，成為《安眠醫生》最有意思的彩蛋。男主角伊旺麥奎格就說，「導演不只是懂得如何運用攝影機，身為史蒂芬金鐵粉的他，更懂得如何重現全景飯店，調度所有令人興奮的鏡位，讓演員能在那些出色的場景中演出，實在是超酷的！」
現在導演麥可弗拉納根回頭看自己，為何從小學五年級就開始著迷史蒂芬金的作品，他說，「史蒂芬金一項都擅長刻畫與眾不同的角色，描述他們因為和別人不一樣，所以感到孤獨、寂寞的故事，其實這些人都只是希望能被理解、被看見。」這讓他在青春期的成長過程中，從小說文字找到了認同與力量，「每個人都有和別人不一樣的面向，面對自己的不同，不管我們選擇隱藏還是向世人展現，都是一件非常可怕的事，甚至在年紀很小的時候，就能理解這種懼怕不一樣的感受。」他希望透過《安眠醫生》，可以提想大家，「雖然這個世界害怕接受不一樣，但我們不要害怕自己的與眾不同、使展我們的能力，讓這個世界變得沒有那麼糟糕，繼續『閃靈』吧！」

From the fifth grade, I fell in love with Stephen King and finally photographed Dr. Sleeping Doctor.

Director Michael Flanagan is a famous ""fascination"" in Stephen King in Hollywood, because when he just went there to seek development, he carried Steven King's novel ""Jerrod Game"", and everyone recommended it. It is worth making a movie. Finally, the year before, Netflix funded the ""Jerrod Game"", which also allowed him to finally get the favor of Stephen King himself, so that he had the opportunity to prepare ""The Doctor of Sleeping"".
Director Michael Flanagan has been fascinated by Stephen King's novels since the fifth grade, although this age is not suitable for watching horror stories or movies, but Stephen King's work has completely changed the way he sees the world. Michael said, ""Being a timid child, reading his work in adolescence, teaching me how to brave in a short time, is also an exercise I learned to shape a fictional character. I continue to read his work and strive for the upper reaches all the way. A director who paid for my money to make a movie can now even direct the adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, which is very unbelievable to me.""
After the launch of ""Jerrod Games"", Stephen King wrote to tell him ""I like it very much"" and asked him to discuss the opportunity to transcribe ""The Doctor of Sleeping"" into a movie. At the beginning, Stephen King didn't really want to talk about it. In the end, let him change his mind. In addition to ensuring that the story of the novel and the story of the classic movie were skillfully combined, the director also sold Guan Guan and said, ""I want to let the wine drink for 8 years."" Master Danny slowly recovered, and then let him sit in the bar of the Panorama Hotel, with a whiskey in front, he might or might not drink..."" This made Stephen King also curious about how the film would develop.
As everyone knows, Stephen King doesn't like the movie ""Ghost Shop"". He thinks that the movie has completely removed the process of how Jack is addicted to alcohol and how to pull out the river. It turns into a madman who scares the audience. He even described ""Ghost Shop"" as a central theme with ""Cadillac without an engine.""


Danny McGuire's Danny, who grew up in ""The Doctor of Sleeping"", must return to the Panorama Hotel, the most scary scene of ""Ghost Shop"". (provided by Warner Bros.)

Therefore, the adaptation of ""The Doctor of Sleeping"" is particularly costly to explain the main character Danny, how to face the demons and temptations like a father, and how to gradually recover themselves from the mud of alcohol addicts. For the director Michael's attempt, Stephen King said: ""He not only used a broad mind to analyze the story of Danny's growing up, but also further extended the ""Ghost Shop"" of Shi Danli Kubrick, showing more human struggles. Content, successfully blending the film and the novel story.""
The visual and artistic style of ""Ghost Shop"" has influenced countless horror films of future generations. Director Michael retains these classic elements, whether it is the panoramic hotel scene, the endless corridor, the twin sister flower ghosts, the bar, the crystal chandelier's saloon. Wait, all of them are rebuilt, but they are seamlessly connected with ""Ghost Shop"" on the screen, so that the audience can immediately feel a chilling atmosphere and become the most interesting egg of ""The Doctor of Sleeping"". The hero, Ivan McGuig, said, ""The director doesn't just know how to use the camera. As a Steven Kim, he knows how to reproduce the panoramic restaurant, dispatch all the exciting mirrors, and let the actors in those The performance in the excellent scene is really cool!""
Now director Michael Flanagan looks back at himself, why he has been fascinated by Stephen King’s work since the fifth grade of elementary school. He said, “Stephan King is good at portraying different characters and describing them because they are different from others. So the story of loneliness and loneliness, in fact, these people just hope to be understood and seen."" This made him find identity and strength from the novel in the process of adolescent growth. ""Everyone has something different from others."" Face-to-face, facing our own differences, whether we choose to hide or show them to the world, it is a very terrible thing. Even at a very young age, we can understand this feeling of fear."" He hopes that through ""Doctor Sleeping"" can think of everyone, ""Although the world is afraid of accepting different things, we should not be afraid of being different and show our ability to make the world less so bad. Continue to ""Sparkle"" !""
