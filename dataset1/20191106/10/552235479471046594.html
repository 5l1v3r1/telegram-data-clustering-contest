      <p>First Minister <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> intends to hold a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/indyref2">second referendum</a> on Scottish independence next year.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said if the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> 'win' at the upcoming general election on December 12, her party's demands for another vote will become 'irresistible'.</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said: "It is my intention to have a referendum next year.</p>
      <p>"On this question of will Westminster allow it or not, we are the start of an election campaign - this is an opportunity for the people in Scotland to have their say and make their views known.</p>
      <p>"If the SNP win this election, I think that demand becomes irresistible.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"This idea that for self-interest reasons Westminster politicians can stand in the way of people in Scotland choosing their own future, we already see that start to crumble."</p>
      <p>Sturgeon said Labour were already "pretty much conceding" it could not stand in the way of a second independence vote and added: "I suspect it won't be too much longer until we see the Tories struggle to maintain that argument as well."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/indy2-support-rubbished-jeremy-corbyn-20761262">told the Daily Record last month</a> that "Labour would not support a bid for second referendum in the formative years of a Labour government."</p>
