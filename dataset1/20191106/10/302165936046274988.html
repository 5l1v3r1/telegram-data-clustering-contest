      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6 — Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan had jokingly predicted that there could be a snap election next year if the transition of power between Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and his successor Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim does not take place.</p>
      <p><i>The Star</i> reported that Mohamad, fondly known as Tok Mat, urged Tanjung Piai voters to send a strong message to the ruling Pakatan Harapan (PH) administration.</p>
      <p>“We should not let Pakatan continue ruling for a full term because the people are suffering. By early next year, if Tun (Dr Mahathir) does not hand over the power to Anwar, the Parliament may be dissolved.</p>
      <p>“Let us emulate the spirit of (previous by-elections) Cameron Highlands, Semenyih and Rantau, and work hard to win back Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>“We must put our foot down because the country’s sliding economy is worrying,” he reportedly said on the campaign trail to over 200 villagers at Kampung Penerok in Kukup last night.</p>
      <p>The Umno deputy spent two hours mingling with the villagers in support of the Barisan Nasional (BN) candidate Datuk Seri Wee Jeck Seng.</p>
      <p>He later clarified to the press that he was only joking about the snap election.</p>
      <p>“I just want to remind the Barisan machinery not to be complacent, but to be fully prepared if the 15th General Election is held early.</p>
      <p>“Despite the Muafakat Nasional alliance, it is not going to be a sure win for us,” he said, adding that fielding an MCA candidate in the by-election showed that Barisan was “looking at the bigger picture” while rejecting racism.</p>
      <p>Muafakat Nasional is the new alliance between PAS and Umno formalised in September under a Unity Charter between Malaysia’s biggest Malay-based parties.</p>
      <p>He also voiced his confidence that the new alliance can take back 10 states in the 15th General Election.</p>
      <p>“Based on the current political scenario, the new alliance will allow us to get back Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Perak and Kedah.</p>
      <p>“Apart from these four states, we can also take back Johor and Selangor, provided there are no more fights among Barisan component parties.</p>
      <p>“Unity brings peace, dispute causes harm. That’s why we must not fight among ourselves,” he was quoted saying.</p>
