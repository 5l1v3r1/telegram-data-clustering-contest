《書上設計展2019》：得獎設計師的真心話與大冒險
06 Nov 2019, 10:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是面對生活舉目所見，總不免有些蠢蠢欲動的內心戲。但如果只是存在心中、活在腦海，將永遠沒什麼不同。放諸行動，也許未必得償所願，但離開了原點，必然又有一番不同的視野。新銳們，懷抱著青春無敵的衝勁，是時候放下背負太多的包袱了。



文：尼普利編輯室企劃
「You must be the change you want to see in the world.」（你必須成為在世界上想要看見的那個改變），印度國父甘地曾如此說。設計，不免肩負著改變的使命，然而，每一個改變，儘管在設計的腦海裡是清晰的，但對於旁人卻是模糊懵懂。如何能被看見、被了解？一種從自身開始，屬於你的態度、你的調調，自然而然化於無形，讓改變發生。
這次在《書上設計展2019》中，希望帶出一個成為自己的「態度」，這個態度，就從自己開始，勇敢行動，成為你自己就好。簡單卻也很不簡單，這經常必須先經過一番自我的質疑、掙扎，從零開始。但，總得真心，才能成為。

〈移工世代〉在這裡，創造出我們的時代！

隨著全球化，工作在他方已成常態，台灣有許多人在世界各地工作、生活；同時也有不同國家的人，來到了台灣。〈移工世代〉探討的是在台灣的移工—這群漂流在外的異鄉人。為了補足失衡的人力與需求，台灣一直存在一群為生活打拼的移工；因此也讓某些人力的缺口，因為他們的存在而完整。這個該被正視的問題，常因為不了解，而帶上特殊眼光，隔閡了彼此。如何能增進彼此的了解、相互尊重；進而替整個社會，注入更多正向氛圍。

〈怪物實驗室〉不人道的動物實驗，最終自食惡果將會是人類

從第一個成功複製的哺乳類—桃莉羊開始，人類擁有複製獨立個體的能力。在中國也宣稱透過基因編輯，誕生首例愛滋免疫嬰兒。基改議題，不是新鮮事；已故物理、宇宙學家史蒂芬‧霍金，甚至預言未來，透過基因編輯誕生的超級人類將顛覆世界。隨著生物技術進步，基改衍生的爭議不休，〈怪物實驗室〉透過一系列造型奇異的公仔，企圖為實驗中痛苦掙扎的動物發聲；乃至完美人類的誕生，喚起人類的同理心及對道德倫理的思考。

〈束髮拾伍〉捐髮，小事成就希望

攤開掌心，從拇指到小指－15公分，看似短短的距離，可以做些什麼？這已足夠成就一個人自信的開端！從前以為，捐髮就得把頭髮留到看不見的未來，一種意志力大考驗。藉由〈束髮拾伍〉發現，短短一把尺的長度，就可以是開始。你的一點點，能給別人嶄新面貌與奕奕朝氣；只是分享的愛心，還得適當的處理，才不會浪費了得來不易的愛心。透過溫暖手感的插畫，不只認識捐髮這檔事；更因為正向的力量，「剪」出正能量的勇氣。

〈城市菌生—生活突變的建築〉好建築不應該只服務有錢人

關於違建，你存在怎樣的印象？隨著人口的攀升，加劇的財富不均，居住空間跟品質，跟著收入也成某種程度正相關。增建，爭取更多空間的產物，一種無法明說、遊走灰色邊緣的隱性常態。在不斷疊加的二次施工，默默造就一番特有的城市風貌。現狀既已存在，同理其解決需求的心情，用如何更好的方式，是眼前能思考並解決的。除了剷除，〈城市菌生－生活突變的建築〉源自增生建築的規劃，用不同的面向，領人回歸本質，正視這左右為難。

〈蘊綠釀時蹤〉蘊釀自然的時光蹤影

對於眷村，你的印象是什麼呢？隨著時間演進，眷村已成台灣歷史文化不可或缺的一部分。位於霧峰的「光復新村」，不只是早期台灣第一個新市鎮；更將工作與居住區合而為一，設計成低人口密度、高綠地比率生活空間的「花園城市」。〈蘊綠釀時蹤〉循其本身優勢，融合近年風行的小農有機農耕，企圖成就一個自給自足的永續住宅。時間在流動，具時代意義的點滴，漸為洪流稀釋，根基在自己的特色再生，才能長久且活出地方自身的模樣。

〈SIRCALL〉吃不完，材好玩

隨著設計意識的提高，關於包裝的質量也越來越注重。只是除了視覺美感的要求外，如何兼顧使用者痛點的思考，解決隱藏存在的問題？〈SIRCALL〉的pizza包裝，除了對質感的營造，還有實際問題的考量。像是龐大的份量，經常有苦於該如何處理剩食存放的困擾；其在包裝本身，就有拆分小包裝的收納設計，很是貼心。還有像衛生紙抽取等等的設計結合，都替除了美觀之外，如何有實用巧思的融入，帶來更窩心的感動設計。

〈Under 1.0〉你看見了嗎？那些遠方的呼救

你可以再靠近一點。〈Under 1.0〉這作品很有意思，讓人不知不覺間就左左右右、上上下下起來，腳步跟著就靠了過來。透過視力表的媒介，傳達對動物深深的關懷。看不見，就真的消失了。很多時候，存在的理所當然，反倒不受重視；直至意識到即將逝去，才發現為時已晚。透過生活化的象徵，激發對周遭環境物種的關注，你我一個小動作，帶來的都可能是長遠的影響。改變，就從當下。絕滅了，再靠近也找不回存在過的痕跡。

自從有同學脫離新一代設計展在校外辦畢業展後，帶起一股同學為自己的畢製策展的風潮。2018年台科大雖然與其他學校聯合舉辦三校聯展，不過有三位同學判斷自己的作品不適合這種聯展模式，於是大膽地自行策展，甚至也去跟企業談贊助，於濕地、大稻埕莊義芳商行兩地展開巡迴個展—「Message Flow（信息流）」，以思辨設計（Speculative Design）為作品創作手法，構築出這場別開生面的異類畢展。曾到TU Eindhoven 交換學生的張文飛與參展藝術家王少均為本展策展人，他們將「信息」作為策展概念主軸，和另一位參展藝術家黃渝晴，將自己的畢業製作視為藝術作品來執行。

﹝得獎之後﹞得獎設計師的真心話與大冒險

你說設計師做設計做得好好的，他為什麼想得獎？到底是為了滿足自己的虛榮心？還是想藉由獎項肯定自己的存在證明？也許以上皆是，但有可能也只是想要比賽的獎金，好讓自己付完學貸。不管如何，「參加比賽得獎」這件事本身，的確對學生充滿魅力；但人生並非如此簡單，不會因為你得了一個獎，人生就從此飛黃騰達，也不會因為你沒得獎，就從此與設計絕緣。

""Book Design Exhibition 2019"": Truthful words and big adventures of award-winning designers
06 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that in the face of life, you can’t help but feel like you’re in the heart. But if it is only in the heart and in the mind, it will never be different. If you put it into action, you may not be able to get what you want, but if you leave the original point, you will have a different vision. The new sharp, holding the youthful and invincible impulse, it is time to put down the burden of too much.



Text: Nipley's editorial office plan
""You must be the change you want to see in the world."" (The change you want to see in the world), the Indian father Gandhi said. Design, can not help but shoulder the mission of change, however, every change, although clear in the mind of the design, is ambiguous to others. How can I be seen and understood? One begins with oneself, belongs to your attitude, and your tone is naturally invisible, letting change happen.
In this book Design Exhibition 2019, I hope to bring out an ""attitude"" that is my own. This attitude starts from myself, acts bravely, and becomes your own. Simple but not very simple, this often has to go through some self-questioning, struggle, starting from scratch. However, it must be true to be able to become.

""Migration Generation"" is here to create our era!

With globalization, work has become the norm in other countries. There are many people in Taiwan who work and live around the world. At the same time, people from different countries come to Taiwan. The ""Migration Generation"" explores the transfer of labor in Taiwan - this group of strangers drifting outside. In order to make up for the imbalanced manpower and needs, Taiwan has always had a group of migrant workers who work hard for life; therefore, it also makes certain human resources gaps complete because of their existence. This problem that should be squarely, often because of not understanding, brings a special vision and separates each other. How to enhance mutual understanding and mutual respect; and then inject more positive atmosphere into the whole society.

Beginning with the first successfully replicated mammal, the Taoli sheep, humans have the ability to replicate independent individuals. In China, it was also announced that the first AIDS immunization baby was born through genetic editing. The issue of fundamental reform is not new; the late physics, cosmologist Stephen Hawking, and even the future, the superhumans born through genetic editing will subvert the world. With the advancement of biotechnology, the controversy of the reform of the basic reform is endless. The ""Monster Lab"" attempts to vocalize the painful animals in the experiment through a series of strange dolls; even the birth of a perfect human, evokes human empathy and Thinking about morality.

Spread your palm, from the thumb to the little finger -15 cm, seemingly short distance, what can be done? This is enough to make a confident start! I used to think that if I donate my hair, I have to leave my hair in an invisible future, a test of willpower. It was discovered by the fact that the length of a ruler can be started. A little bit of you can give others a new look and enthusiasm; just sharing the love, you have to deal with it properly, so that you will not waste your hard-earned love. Through the warm-feeling illustration, not only do you know the donation; but because of the positive power, you can ""cut"" the courage of positive energy.

What is your impression of illegal construction? As the population climbs, the intensified wealth is uneven, and the living space and quality are also positively related to income. The product of additional construction, striving for more space, a hidden normal that cannot be said and walked away from the gray edge. In the secondary construction that is constantly superimposed, it creates a unique urban style. The status quo already exists, and the same way to solve the demand, with a better way, can be thought and solved. In addition to eradication, ""urban bacteria - life-changing buildings"" originated from the planning of hyperplastic buildings, with different orientations, leading people back to the essence, facing this dilemma.

As the awareness of design increases, so does the quality of packaging. In addition to the requirements of visual aesthetics, how to balance the pain points of users and solve hidden problems? The pizza package of <SIRCALL>, in addition to the creation of texture, has practical considerations. Like a huge amount of weight, it often suffers from the trouble of how to deal with the leftover food storage; in the packaging itself, there is a storage design that splits the small package, which is very intimate. There is also a combination of design like toilet paper extraction, etc., in addition to aesthetics, how to integrate practical and ingenious, bring a more touching design.

You can get closer again. <Under 1.0> This work is very interesting, people unconsciously left and right, up and down, and the footsteps followed. Through the medium of the eye chart, convey the deep concern for the animals. If you can't see it, it really disappears. Many times, the existence of the matter is, of course, not valued; until it is realized that it is about to die, it is too late to find out. Through the symbol of life, to stimulate the attention of the surrounding environmental species, you and I may have a long-term impact. Change, just from the moment. Extinct, and close to find the traces that have existed.

[New Generation After Waves] is difficult to categorize special prize - Message Flow


""Book Design Exhibition 2019"" New Generation After Wave Award _ (Important Special Award) Message FlowPhoto Credit: Nipley Publishing

Since the classmates left the next-generation design exhibition at the off-campus graduation exhibition, they have brought a classmate to their own curatorial curatorial trend. In 2018, although the Taiwan University of Science and Technology jointly organized a joint exhibition of three schools with other schools, three students judged that their works were not suitable for this type of joint exhibition mode, so they boldly curated themselves and even talked with companies about sponsorship, in wetlands and rice blasts. Zhuang Yifang's business travels to the exhibition, ""Message Flow"", and uses Speculative Design as the creative method to create a unique exhibition of this kind. Zhang Wenfei, who has exchanged students with TU Eindhoven, and Wang Shao, the exhibitor of the exhibition, are curators of this exhibition. They use ""information"" as the main axis of curatorial concept, and another participating artist, Huang Yuqing, regards his graduation production as a work of art.

You said that the designer did a good job of designing, why did he want to win the prize? In the end is to satisfy your own vanity? Still want to affirm your existence proof by the award? Maybe all of the above, but it may just be a bonus for the game, so that I can pay for the student. In any case, the ""winning the competition"" itself is indeed full of charm for students; but life is not so simple, it won't be because you won a prize, life will flourish, and you won't win because you didn't win the prize. Insulated from the design.
