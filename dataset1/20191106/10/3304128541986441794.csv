A postmortem report showed that Emmanuel Solomon died of excessive bleeding in the stomach and had severe stomach ulcers that led to hemorrhage.
His mother, police said, kept him in the house and invited church members to worship and praise the Lord as he withered away.
Police also said they were yet to ascertain if Inyama, a PhD student, belongs to a cult.
She is a specialist in post-resuscitation care of the critically ill. This involves optimizing ventilation and circulation and preserving organ and tissue function.
