中國偷渡者回憶 為何沒死在集裝箱內

06 Nov 2019, 10:14

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】英國卡車集裝箱39人死亡命案，引發國際社會對偷渡者的關注。1名在英國生活多年的中國偷渡者回憶說，他當年偷渡時，幸虧隨身攜帶了一把槌子和一隻鏍絲刀，因此沒有死在集裝箱內。
英國卡車集裝箱39人死亡命案震驚全世界，在此之前，2000年在英國肯特郡多佛港也發生一起58名中國籍偷渡者集體窒息事件。
多年以來，中國大陸一直有絡繹不絕的偷渡者，冒著風險偷渡到美國或者英國。來自福建的偷渡者王安(化名)已在英國生活多年，他對美國之音說，「這39個人讓我想起以前─在路上的時候，我告訴自己，以後即使看到地上有一粒米也要撿起來吃。」
10年前「為了討生活」，王安成為一名偷渡者，他回憶並講述了那段痛苦的偷渡旅程，他從廈門經新加坡再到聖彼德堡，生平首次搭飛機就到了俄羅斯。
王安說，他和同伴都不知道行程，只知道付給蛇頭一萬四千英鎊的目的地是英國，「一踏上旅程，就是他們（蛇頭）控制了。」
王安一行人在俄羅斯被送上火車，並被告之，火車一停就趕快跳車。大約10多個小時後，火車突然停了，一群人急忙跳下火車，接應人把他們帶到當地農家，10多名壯丁被關在一間屋內，每天只有兩條麵包可分食。
王安後來發現自己在烏克蘭，因為接應他們的烏克蘭人粗暴無比。在一個月黑風高的晚上，他們被送到森林中，接下來的日子，就是翻山越嶺，從烏克蘭、斯洛伐克、捷克到奧地利，他們每到一站都有人接應，「一個接一個，就是跟著帶路人走」，餐風宿露，有人不支倒下，也有人開始哭泣。但沒被捉到，沒落單，王安說自己還算幸運。
偷渡到英國的中國籍人士多來自福建長樂和福清兩地，王安一群人一路躲藏，最後到了荷蘭，被送進一間屋子內，那裡有更多不同時間抵達準備偷渡的中國人，謝平是其中一個，「每天吃睡，等安排」。
大約2個月後，王安才終於聽到一句：「今晚走」。
他回憶說，他們搭車到比利時的一個港口，凌晨時分逐一悄悄地爬進停放在那裡的卡車後面貨櫃內，然後被反鎖在裡面，至於這是什麼貨櫃，是否為集裝箱，似乎就全看運氣了。
王安登上貨櫃，稍後出發的謝平則進入了集裝箱，「你就那樣感覺到空氣越來越稀薄，直到快無法呼吸了…」幸好，謝平聽取了其他有經驗偷渡者的經驗，隨身攜帶了一把槌子和一隻鏍絲刀。
他開始打洞，但同行中有人反對，唯恐打洞聲音太大會被發現，「人都快死了，還怕什麼?」。謝平的槌子和鏍絲刀救了集裝箱內20多條生命，包括他自己。
經過逾6個月的長途跋踄，王安和謝平最後都到了英國。
10年後，謝平把留在中國的妻子也接出來，他們跟大部分到英國的福建人一樣，開中餐外賣店，做裝修工程，存足一筆錢就寄回老家蓋房子，並設法把親人一一花錢接出來。
謝平的妻子說，雖然擔心丈夫冒風險，但「我們鄉下人，沒文化；這條路，是最後的打算。」
如今，謝平和王安在英國均成家立業，問他們兩人若時光流轉，還會選擇偷渡嗎？他們異口同聲的說，當年的情況，「讓你覺得沒得選」。
不過，謝平坦承，「說是為生活，但那也不是全部的理由，應該還有羨慕和比較。」但他強調，到了英國也不是就進了天堂，還是要勤奮工作。
那麼現在中國人是否不必再偷渡到海外打工了？謝王兩人都表示「不盡然」，指還是會有人偷渡出來。

Chinese stowaways recall why they did not die in the container

06 Nov 2019, 10:14

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] The death of 39 people in the UK truck container has caused the international community to pay attention to stowaways. A Chinese smuggler who has lived in the UK for many years recalls that when he was smuggling, he was lucky enough to carry a pair of scorpions and a slashing knife, so he did not die in the container.
The death of 39 people in the British truck container shocked the world. Before that, a group of 58 Chinese smugglers suffocated in Dover, Kent, England in 2000.
For many years, mainland China has been continually smuggling into the United States or the United Kingdom. Wang An (pseudonym), a stowaway from Fujian, has lived in the UK for many years. He said to the Voice of America, ""The 39 people remind me of the past - when I was on the road, I told myself that even if I saw a grain of rice on the ground, I want to pick it up and eat.""
Ten years ago, ""To save lives,"" Wang An became a stowaway. He recalled and talked about the painful smuggling journey. He traveled from Xiamen to Singapore and then to St. Petersburg. He traveled to Russia for the first time.
Wang An said that he and his companions did not know the itinerary. They only knew that the destination for paying the head of the snake for £14,000 was the United Kingdom. ""As soon as they set foot on the journey, they were controlled by the snakehead.""
Wang An and his entourage were sent to the train in Russia and were told that the train would jump as soon as the train stopped. After about 10 hours, the train suddenly stopped. A group of people hurriedly jumped off the train. The pickers took them to the local farmhouse. More than 10 young men were locked in a house. Only two breads were eaten every day.
Wang An later found himself in Ukraine because the Ukrainians who met them were extremely rude. On a dark night of high winds, they were sent to the forest. The next days, they were over the mountains, from Ukraine, Slovakia, the Czech Republic to Austria. Every time they arrived, they all met, ""one by one, that is. Followed by the passers-by, the meal was exposed, some people fell, and some began to cry. But he was not caught, no orders, Wang An said that he was lucky.
Most of the Chinese people who sneaked into the UK came from Fujian Changle and Fuqing. A group of Wang An people hid all the way. Finally they arrived in the Netherlands and were sent to a room where there were more different time to arrive at the Chinese who were preparing to sneak. Xie Ping Is one of them, ""eat and sleep every day, wait for arrangements.""
About two months later, Wang Ancai finally heard a sentence: ""Go away tonight.""
He recalled that they took a ride to a port in Belgium and climbed into the container behind the truck parked there in the early hours of the morning, and then locked in it. As for what container, whether it is a container, it seems that luck is all about it. It is.
Wang An boarded the container, and Xie Ping, who started later, entered the container. ""You feel that the air is getting thinner and thinner until you can't breathe..."" Fortunately, Xie Ping listened to the experience of other experienced stowaways and carried it with him. A pair of tweezers and a silk knife.
He started to make holes, but some people in the same industry opposed it. I am afraid that if the hole is too loud, it will be discovered. ""People are dying, what are they afraid of?"" Xie Ping’s nephew and silk knives saved more than 20 lives in the container, including himself.
After more than six months of long journey, Wang An and Xie Ping finally arrived in the UK.
Ten years later, Xie Ping took out his wife who stayed in China. Like most of the Fujianese in the UK, they opened a Chinese food takeaway shop and did renovation work. They saved a sum of money and sent it back to their homes to build a house and managed to bring their loved ones. I will pay for it one by one.
Xie Ping’s wife said that although she was worried about her husband’s risk, “our countryman has no culture; this road is the last plan.”
Today, Xie Ping and Wang An have established a family business in the UK. They ask them if they want to sneak into the country if they are passing through. They said in unison, the situation in the past, ""Let you feel that you have no choice.""
However, Xie Pingcheng, ""It is for life, but that is not the whole reason. There should be envy and comparison."" But he stressed that it is not a matter of going to heaven in the UK, or working hard.
So now, do Chinese people have to sneak into overseas work? Both of them said that ""not all"" means that someone would sneak out.
