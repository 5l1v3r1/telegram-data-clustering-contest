      <p>Word around the web is WhatsApp is slated to get <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whatsapp-is-getting-two-dark-modes">not one, but two</a> different dark mode options on iPhones… sometime in the future. The company is also working on a dark theme for Android, but there’s no mention of when that might land either. But if you want dark mode on WhatsApp’s web version, there’s a way to do it.</p>
      <p>For now, the trick works on Chrome and Firefox. Here’s how it’s done:</p>
      <h3>Chrome</h3>
      <p>Alright, follow these steps to enable dark mode:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You’ll need to install the Stylus extension and a separate theme for it.</li>
        <li>You can grab Stylus from the Chrome Web Store by clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Once installed, get the theme from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/142096/dark-whatsapp-theme-by-mew?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage">here</a> by clicking “Install Style.”</li>
        <li>Load WhatsApp Web and let your eyeballs enjoy the darkness.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Firefox</h3>
      <p>The procedure for Firefox is pretty much the same as for Chrome. Here are the steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get Stylus from the Mozilla official site by clicking <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Install the dark theme from <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/142096/dark-whatsapp-theme-by-mew?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage">this link</a>.</li>
        <li>Boom, dark mode is now turned on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After a quick test, it seems the web-based dark mode doesn’t improve readability in daylight all that much (it doesn’t make it worse either). I’m sure it’ll be a different late at night, when the lights are off, however.</p>
      <p>The good thing about the Stylus extension is that it lets you effortlessly switch between dark mode and the standard theme by clicking a button. Just click on the Stylus icon at the top-right corner of your browser, and tick “Turn all styles off” on or off. And if you want a different theme, just browse User Styles until you find one that suits your eyes.</p>
      <p>Anyways, if you’re obsessed with putting less strain on your eyes in the dark (even though <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dark-mode-chrome-android-ios-science">scientists aren’t sure</a> that’s the case), you know what to do now.</p>
