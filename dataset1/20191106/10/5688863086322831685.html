      <h3>Key Players</h3>
      <p>Former ISL golden boot winner Marcelniho scored a brilliant freekick goal against Kerala Blasters and will be the go-to man for Phil Brown. The Brazilian scored two goals this season in Hyderabad's total tally of three goals. It will be a huge burden for him to carry the attacks in the absence of major foreigners. Another key player to watch out for will be Adhil Khan in the Hyderabad camp.</p>
      <p>For NorthEast United, Ghanian all-time top scorer Asamoah Gyan will be the danger man. He is in excellent form and has scored two goals in three games. Young Indian winger Redeem Tlang is also in a fine form with two goals and can wreck damage to the opposition. Highlanders’ captain Jose Luedo is another player to watch out for.</p>

Moreover, Spanish midfielder Nestor Gordillo is suspended till December, which is the biggest blow.</p>
