NAKITA namin si Harlene Bautista sa premiere night ng “The Art of Ligaw” last Tuesday evening sa Trinoma Cinema 7 in Quezon City kasama ang boyfriend nitong si Neil Eugenio. Sinabi ng bunsong kapatid nina Herbert at Hero Bautista  na wala pa umano siyang nakukuhang playdate para sa pelikulang “Isa Pang Bahaghari” na pinagbibidahan nina Nora Aunor at Phillip Salvador at dinirek ni Joel Lamangan under Heaven’s Best Entertainment matapos itong hindi makapasok sa Magic 8 ng 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival.
“Malamang next year na pagkatapos ng MMFF pero titingnan ko pa ang playdate na puwede naming kunin at kung aling pelikula ang makakasabay,” pahayag ni Harlene na kababalik pa lamang galing Australia.

We met Harlene Bautista at the premiere night of ""The Art of Ligaw"" last Tuesday evening at Trinoma Cinema 7 in Quezon City with her boyfriend Neil Eugenio. Herbert and Hero Bautista's youngest brother says he has yet to get a playdate for the movie ""Another Rainbow"" starring Nora Aunor and Phillip Salvador and directed by Joel Lamangan under Heaven's Best Entertainment after failing to enter Magic 8 in 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival.
""It's probably next year after the MMFF but I'm still looking at the playdate we can pick up and which movie to go with,"" Harlene said just coming back from Australia.
