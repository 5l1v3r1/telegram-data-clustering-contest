KZ may potential tulad ni Kim
06 Nov 2019, 10:41 by Aster Amoyo
SUPORTADO ni Boy2 Quizon ang kanyang uncle na si Epy Quizon sa bagong movie nito ngayon na “The Art of Ligaw” na pinagtatambalan nila ng singer-turned-actress na si KZ Tandigan.
Bukod kay Boy2 na dumalo sa red carpet premiere ng “The Art of Ligaw” na ginanap last Tuesday evening, namataan din namin doon sina Donita Rose, Gary Lim at ang bumubuo ng cast na sina Epy Quizon, KZ Tandingan, Roxanne Barcelo, Archie Alemania, ang director ng pelikula na si Jourdan Sebastian, ang mga producer ng pelikula at ang bumubuo ng produksiyon.
Kakaiba ang atake ng pelikula in narrative style.  Rebelasyon naman sa amin si KZ na may innate talent pala sa pag-arte.  She was raw and natural at may potential na maging isa ring komedyana tulad ni Kim Molina.

Boy2 Quizon is joining his uncle Epy Quizon in his new movie ""The Art of Ligaw"" with them being sung by singer-turned-actress KZ Tandigan.
In addition to Boy2 attending the red carpet premiere of ""The Art of Wild"" held last Tuesday evening, we also noted Donita Rose, Gary Lim and cast members Epy Quizon, KZ Tandingan, Roxanne Barcelo, Archie Alemania , film director Jourdan Sebastian, the film's producers and production coordinator.
The movie attacks in a unique style. KZ is an inspiration to us with innate talent in acting. She is raw and natural and has the potential to be a comedian like Kim Molina.
