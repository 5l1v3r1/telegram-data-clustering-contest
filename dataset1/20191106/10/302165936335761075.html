      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 6 — <i>Trouble in Paradise</i> is the lead single for Rufus Wainwright’s forthcoming new album, which is due at a yet-unknown date in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the album release, the vocalist unveiled the accompanying music video for <i>Trouble in Paradise</i>, which was directed by Montreal-based filmmaker Mia Donovan.</p>
      <p>The black-and-white visuals sees Wainwright debuting a new persona inspired by the legendary editor-in-chief of <i>Vogue</i>, Anna Wintour.</p>
      <p>The clip follows the vocalist in the various stages of his transformation into the character, while he warns “You see me here in my dress all in order/You see me there, my hair/A solid steel bob/But all you see is in fact just the armour.”</p>
      <p>Wainwright previously described his return single as a “nod to solid pop rock production of previous classic LA era’s motors the listener on with both a sense of sophistication and an animalistic instinct.”</p>
      <p><i>Trouble in Paradise</i> is set to appear on Wainwright’s forthcoming eighth studio album, which will follow his 2012 <i>Out of the Game</i>.</p>
      <p>While Mark Ronson helmed his previous opus, the <i>Foolish Love</i> vocalist collaborated for the first time with American producer Mitchell Froom for his yet-untitled full-length, which will be released under his new label BMG.</p>
      <p>Although details about the project are still scarce to this date, Wainwright referred to the upcoming album as the “bookend” to his debut self-titled album.</p>
      <p>“But back then, I really had no clue what I was doing and after 20 years of being in this business and sidestepping in the symphony and opera world, theatre and many other side projects, I feel I have reached a certain maturity as an artist and songwriter both in my writing but also in my vocal abilities and know how to put together a song. I hope you agree,” he wrote on his website.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Wainwright notably dueted with American actress Renee Zellweger on a rendition of <i>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</i> for the soundtrack to the new Judy Garland biopic.</p>
      <p>The musician is currently on tour across the US, with his last show taking place at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas, on November 23.</p>
