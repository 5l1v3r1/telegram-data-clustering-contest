激進譴責反送中 港議員何君堯遇襲受傷

（中央社記者張謙香港6日電）一直與「反送中」運動持對立態度的香港立法會議員何君堯今早遇襲受傷，傷勢未明。
商業電台報導，早上9時前，何君堯與另外兩人在新界屯門啓豐商場遇襲，被人用刀刺傷腹部，送往醫院時仍然清醒。
何君堯也報名參選月底舉行的區議會選舉，選區是屯門樂翠區。
何君堯屬於親政府和北京的建制派人士，「反送中」運動爆發以來，他一直強烈譴責並支持政府「止暴制亂」，且言行激進。
7月21日，元朗有大批白衣人毆打「反送中」黑衣示威者，俗稱「721事件」。由於事前有人看到何君堯與類似白衣人握手，「反送中」支持者認定他與「721事件」有關。
自此之後，何君堯一直被人針對，其地區辦事處接連受到破壞，父母祖墳也遭人毀壞。（編輯：陳家倫）1081106

Radical condemnation of the repatriation of Hong Kong Councillor He Junyi
06 Nov 2019, 10:18 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Zhang Qian, Hong Kong, 6th) The Hong Kong Legislative Council member He Junyi, who has been opposed to the ""reverse delivery"" movement, was injured this morning and his injuries are unknown.
Commercial radio reported that before 9 am, He Junyi and two others were attacked at Qifeng Shopping Mall in Tuen Mun, New Territories. They were stabbed with a knife and were still awake when they were taken to the hospital.
He Junyi also enrolled in the district board elections held at the end of the month. The constituency is the Le Cui district in Tuen Mun.
He Junyi belongs to the pro-government and Beijing-based establishments. Since the outbreak of the ""Reverse Delivery"" campaign, he has strongly condemned and supported the government's ""stopping the storm"" and is radical in words and deeds.
On July 21, a large number of white people in Yuen Long beat up the ""reverse delivery"" black protesters, commonly known as the ""721 incident."" Since someone saw He Junyi shaking hands with a white-like person beforehand, the ""reverse delivery"" supporters determined that he was related to the ""721 incident.""
Since then, He Junyi has been targeted, his regional offices have been damaged successively, and his parents' graves have been destroyed. (Editor: Chen Jialun) 1081106
