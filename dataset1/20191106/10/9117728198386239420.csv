Lewis Hamilton has revealed he squashed any tension between himself and Max Verstappen before the United States Grand Prix. The Brit also spoke about Verstappen's potential and he feels he is a champion of the future.

There looked to be some growing tension between the pair after their opening lap coming together at the Mexican Grand Prix. Hamilton would go on to win that race and he sealed his sixth World Championship at the US Grand Prix a week later. 
The Brit has revealed he wanted to squash any growing tension between them, before they took to the COTA circuit and said that he is a champion of the future.
""I spoke to Max even before the race and I was like, 'Dude you're such a great racer, man. Let's just squash whatever there is between us because it's just fake, it's nothing. Whatever beef [there is] let's just get rid of it. Let's go out there and have a great race',"" Hamilton told Channel 4.

""He's a champion of the future and I'm going to work as hard as I can to stop that happening for a while, but I'm enjoying racing with him.""
