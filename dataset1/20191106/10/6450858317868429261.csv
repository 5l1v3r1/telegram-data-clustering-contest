Babies are expensive. In the first month alone you're looking at around £500 spent on nappies, food and related bits and bobs, so you should make savings wherever you can - especially on the pricey tech that can make your life easier. We've rounded up some great deals on baby tech below.
1. Tommee Tippee Closer To Nature Complete Feeding Kit




From: Mamas & PapasWas: £159.99Now: £74.99  (£85 off) View Deal

This bundle includes everything you need to make baby feeding straightforward, including bottles, a steam steriliser and a bottle warmer.
2. Angelcare AC527 Baby Movement Monitor




From: MothercareWas: £249.99Now: £199.99  (£50 off) View Deal

This Angelcare bundle, available at Mothercare while it's still trading, includes a movement sensor pad as well as a baby monitor and 5in video display.
This means you can monitor the nursery and respond if there is crying, but also be alerted to reduced movement.
3. Mothercare Ocean Adventure Entertainer




From: MothercareWas: £100Now: £40  (£60 off) View Deal

We're sad that it looks like Mothercare will be closing - although we are hopeful it will continue online. In the meantime, you can pick up some good deals, like this Ocean Adventure Entertainer, which is a little like the Rainforest Jumperoo, but much cheaper.
4. Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep




From: AmazonWas: £125.99Now: £78  (£47.99 off) View Deal

The Tommee Tippee Perfect Prep machine is a must-have for any new mum and dad. Rather than boil the kettle, mix the boiling water with the formula, and then wait for the milk to cool before giving it to your screaming baby (or babies) to drink, you can use the Perfect Prep to prepare the formula quickly and know that the milk will be the prefect temperature.
The Perfect Prep machine is particularly useful when you are thumbling around in the early hours trying to prepare a night-time feed.
Amazon has money off right now, so it's a great time to purchase one.
5. Tommee Tippee Express & Go Electric Breast Pump Set




From: AmazonWas: £121.99Now: £80.57  (£41.42 off) View Deal

This electric breast pump set includes everything you need to get started.

7. Mamas & Papas Wave Rocker Baby Bouncer Chair - Wish Upon a Star

A chair that rocks is a great way to calm your baby, or even him or her it to go to sleep! There are three recline positions, four melodies, and a vibrate function. Plus Mamas & Papas has money off right now.
8. Braun ThermoScan 3 Thermometer




From: AmazonWas: £34.99Now: £20  (£14.99 off) View Deal

No matter how you protect your baby from germs at some point you will have to face a cold, or worse. Find out how high their temperature is with this handy little gadget. We find it much easier to use than the flimsy film thermometer you have to hold on their forehead (because kids never stay still long enough for them to work!) This takes a second!
9. Fisher-Price Rainforest Spacesaver Jumperoo




From: AmazonWas: £92.99Now: £74.89  (£18.10 off) View Deal

There's a smaller version of the popular Rainforest Jumperoo. The Rainforest Spacesaver Jumperoo folds up, which is handy if your living room is full of baby stuff. Baby gets to jump and enjoy flashing lights, music and even play on the piano.

BT's Video Baby Monitor 6000 has a 5in screen for watching your baby sleeping, or crying, or climbing out of the cot, on. You can also see the temperature in the nursery.
There's a choice of five lullabies that will hopefully sooth your baby to sleep.
You also have a range of 250m outdoors - so you could probably get to the bottom of the garden, though not all the way down the road.
There's money off right now at Amazon.
 
12. The Gro Company Gro-Egg Room Thermometer




From: AmazonWas: £24.99Now: £13  (£11.99 off) View Deal

The Gro-Egg Room Thermometer not only monitors the temperature in the nursery - it glows a different colour depending on how warm it gets.
