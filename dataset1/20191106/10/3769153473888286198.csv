Coming this week: a full-length Blender tutorial course to teach you everything about creating an insanely realistic animated FPS experience! Includes killer robots - of course.






This course will show you exactly how to animate all the actions needed for a first-person shooter game, from quick boring ones like standing around doing nothing - to more complex stuff like reloading and transforming the rifle into a freaking cool sniper.



You’ll become a pro at working with actions in the NLA editor and action editor, working with curves, structuring your linked files, exporting animations to Unity, and a whole lot more.






In the course, we'll go over the do’s and don’ts of first-person animation so you’ll be prepared to take these skills and transfer them to *any* other type of FPS game...or any other 3D animation app, for that matter.






Whether you’ve been following along with the other FPS courses in the series or you just want to jump right in to this one, you’ll learn a lot!The course drops on cgcookie.com this week (keep your eyes peeled for a SICK trailer).
