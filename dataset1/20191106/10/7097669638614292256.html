      <p>Fifteen jihadists were killed in Tajikistan Wednesday during an attack on a border post that officials blamed on members of the Islamic State group who crossed over from Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The overnight assault, carried out not far from the Tajik capital Dushanbe, also left a soldier and policeman dead, authorities in the ex-Soviet republic said.</p>
      <p>It was the latest bout of jihadist violence to shake the mountainous and impoverished Central Asian nation, which has been battling an Islamist insurgency.</p>
      <p>It came as the country prepared to celebrate its Constitution Day on Wednesday and with long-serving President Emomali Rakhmon on a visit to Europe.</p>
      <p>The interior ministry said about 20 armed assailants attacked the Ishkobod border post some 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of Dushanbe at 3:23 am local time.</p>
      <p>Clashes erupted and "15 members of an armed criminal group were neutralised and four more attackers detained," the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The interior ministry released photographs showing the bodies of several black-clad men on the ground next to a burnt-out vehicle at the scene of the clash, with automatic rifles lying nearby.</p>
      <p>The border guard service said that captured assailants had admitted to crossing illegally into the country from Afghanistan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"All are members of the so-called 'Islamic State' terrorist group," the service said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Tajikistan, a country of nine million bordering Afghanistan and China, has been hit by conflicts since it gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands were killed during a five-year civil war in the 1990s when rebel groups including Islamists rose up against the government.</p>
      <p>- Rise in Islamic extremism -</p>
      <p>In recent years the majority-Muslim country has struggled with a rise in Islamic extremism.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said that more than 1,000 Tajiks joined Islamist fighters in Syria and Iraq in recent years.</p>
      <p>The most famous IS recruit from Tajikistan was Gulmurod Halimov, who headed the interior ministry's special forces unit before sensationally announcing his defection to IS in a video attributed to the group in 2015.</p>
      <p>In May, at least 32 people were killed in a prison riot in Tajikistan, including 19 members of IS and several guards.</p>
      <p>In July last year, an attack on foreign cycling tourists claimed by IS left four dead and two injured.</p>
      <p>Rakhmon came to power during the civil war in the early 1990s and maintains a strong grip on the country.</p>
      <p>He was in Switzerland on Wednesday and due to travel to Paris later in the week to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
      <p>Border areas in Central Asia are the scene of frequent clashes, with a series of recent deadly flare-ups on the contested frontier between Tajikistan and neighbouring Kyrgyzstan.</p>
      <p>Tajikistan also shares 1,344 kilometres (835 miles) of border with Afghanistan, the world's largest producer of opium and heroin.</p>
      <p>Incidents on the border frequently include shootouts and kidnappings of Tajiks by Afghan smugglers who then swap them for arrested traffickers.</p>
