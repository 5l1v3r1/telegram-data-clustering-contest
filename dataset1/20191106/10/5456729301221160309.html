      <p>Pro-Beijing lawmaker, Junius Ho, was on Wednesday morning stabbed while campaigning in his constituency for the upcoming Hong Kong district council elections.</p>
      <p>A video widely circulated online shows the attack on Ho in the far-north town of Tuen Mun.</p>
      <p>The footage shows a man handing Ho a bouquet of flowers while asking for a photo together. He then takes out what appears to be a knife from his bag and stabs Ho in the chest.</p>
      <p>In the video, you can see the attacker being quickly subdued and held down by a group of bystanders.</p>
      <p>A government spokesperson condemned the attack in a statement released later in the day, confirming that a male suspect had been arrested and an in-depth investigation would be conducted.</p>
      <p>While being taken away on a stretcher, Ho told reporters that the wound was superficial.</p>
      <p>Mr Ho is a controversial figure in Hong Kong, who drew widespread criticism after he was seen shaking hands with groups of men in white t-shirts with alleged links to the organised crime group triads.</p>
      <p>The white-shirted men were later captured on video attacking protesters and passengers in Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, which resulted in 45 injuries.</p>
      <p>Mr Ho has denied any connections to the triads and the men seen in the videos.</p>
      <p>The attack on Ho comes as the British colony turned semi-autonomous Chinese territory remains gripped in five months of political unrest and protests.</p>
      <p>Mr Ho is the first pro-Beijing lawmaker campaigning in the current district council elections to be targeted, although pro-democracy candidates and figures have been subject to targeted attacks in the past.</p>
