和孫安佐約砲被譙翻　米砂沮喪po文：死了就能解脫
06 Nov 2019, 10:36 by 吳妍
網紅米砂（Misa）日前爆出跟孫安佐約砲，還一度傳出「親密片外流」，引起不少酸民攻擊，近日她在IG寫下痛苦心聲，「常常想著死了就能解脫，每一天睡覺前我都會想著活著的理由」，情緒似乎相當不穩，令粉絲擔心不已。
米砂近日在IG寫下長文，訴說自己當了公眾人物之後，有時候會覺得活著很沒有意義，原以為賺錢變有名這個感覺會消失，但反而越來越嚴重。
米砂說，自己唯一快樂來源就是頻道的成果，但隨著演算法改變，逐漸失去唯一的快樂來源和活著的動力，「常常想著死了就能解脫，每一天睡覺前我都會想著活著的理由，到底為什麼我只是做自己喜歡的東西，講自己想講的，拍自己想要的照片，卻可以被排擠成這樣。」

她也痛訴，不只是最近媒體或網路上的攻擊，其實從好久以前那些攻擊就沒停止過，「現在雖然更嚴重，但我還能面對的原因居然是因為我習慣了，想想真的覺得自己很可悲。」
米砂負面的文字引起粉絲的擔心，紛紛留言鼓勵：「加油！身體重要，要相信自己」「米砂，我覺得沒有人可以真的做到大家都喜歡，做自己最實在」「米砂加油，我們都在」「做這種行業，心臟真的要夠強，覺得妳已經很厲害了」。

And Sun Anzuo's gun was overturned. Misha frustrated po: If you die, you will be free.

The net red rice sand (Misa) broke out with Sun Anzuo’s guns. It was once reported as “intimate film outflow”, which caused many acid people to attack. Recently, she wrote a painful voice in IG. “I often think that I can die. Freedom, I think about the reasons for living before going to bed every day."" The mood seems to be quite unstable, which makes fans worry.
Misha recently wrote a long article in IG, telling himself that when he became a public figure, he sometimes felt that it was meaningless to live. He thought that the feeling of making money became famous, but it became more and more serious.
Misha said that the only source of happiness is the result of the channel, but as the algorithm changes, it gradually loses the only source of happiness and the motivation to live. ""I often think that when I die, I will be free. I will think about it every day before going to bed."" The reason for living, in the end, why do I just do what I like, tell what I want to say, and take the photos I want, but I can be squeezed into this.""

She also complained that it was not just an attack on the media or the Internet recently. In fact, those attacks have not stopped since a long time ago. ""Although it is more serious now, the reason I can still face it is because I am used to it. Think about it. I feel very sad.""
The negative text of Misha caused fans' worries and encouraged messages: ""Come on! The body is important, believe in yourself"" ""Misha, I don't think anyone can really do what everyone likes and do what they really do."" We are all """" doing this kind of industry, the heart is really strong enough, I feel that it is already very powerful.""
