台鐵豐原站試辦 智慧型影像監控

（中央社記者余曉涵台北6日電）為提升乘車安全，鐵道局在台鐵豐原站試辦「智慧型影像監控系統工程」，選定站區內人流統計等11種條件，監視站內狀況，並透過人臉辨識，有特殊狀況時就立刻通知站務或警務人員處理。
台鐵近年來頻傳人為事故，包含松山車站爆炸案等，為了要提升旅客乘車安全，鐵道局發出的新聞稿表示，耗資經費新台幣2588萬元，選擇在台鐵豐原站試辦「智慧型影像監控系統工程」。
鐵道局說，過去台鐵局在各車站都有建置閉路電視監視系統，但其目的僅在於能夠將各車站重要區域能完整監控，以便在發生緊急或意外狀況時能調閱畫面或予以監控，但卻屬於被動式管理。
因此，鐵道局參考國外先進車站及鐵道局和中科院合作於高鐵台中站建置「智慧影像監控系統」辦理經驗，選定於台鐵豐原站試辦「智慧型影像監控系統工程」。
鐵道局說，智慧型影像監控工程選定11種偵知條件，包含站區內人流統計、人員異常停留/逗留、特定區域停留時間過久、特殊服務/安全警示名單（營運用）、安全特殊名單（警務用）、跨越月台區之警示線、電扶梯上逆向行進、遺留物偵測、火警偵知、異常人流移動及人員/動物異常侵入軌旁等。
鐵道局指出，具有影像辨識能力的監視系統，還可利用數據運算的應用，使終端設備能截取旅客特徵，並透過AI人工智慧分析，能即時就偵知特殊狀況發出告警訊息，通知站務或警務人員處理。
鐵道局表示，目前正與台鐵局及鐵路警察局配合，依其應用成效，共同檢討，配合車站空間與實務運用需求，希望可以篩選出具有營運安全管理需求、能符合經濟性項目，並訂出設置原則，後續也可用於其他台鐵車站。（編輯：方沛清）1081106

Taitung Fengyuan Station Trial Smart Image Surveillance
06 Nov 2019, 10:05 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Yu Xiaohan, Taipei, 6th) In order to improve the safety of passengers, the Railway Bureau piloted the ""Smart Image Surveillance System Project"" at the Taiyuan Fengyuan Station, and selected 11 conditions including the flow statistics in the station area to monitor the situation inside the station and pass the people. Face recognition, immediately notify the station or police officer when there are special circumstances.
In recent years, the Taiwan Railway has frequently caused man-made accidents, including the Songshan station bombings. In order to improve the safety of passengers, the Railway Administration issued a press release saying that it will cost NT$25.88 million and choose to test the ""Smart"" at the Taiyuan Fengyuan Station. Image Monitoring System Engineering.""
The Railway Bureau said that in the past, the Taiwan Railway Administration had built closed-circuit television surveillance systems at various stations, but its purpose was only to be able to fully monitor the important areas of the stations so that they could be viewed or monitored in the event of an emergency or unexpected situation. But it is passive management.
Therefore, the Railway Bureau, with reference to the cooperation between the Advanced Stations and the Railway Bureau and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the establishment of the ""Smart Image Surveillance System"" at the High Speed Rail Taichung Station, selected the ""Smart Image Surveillance System Project"" at the Taiyuan Fengyuan Station.
The Railway Bureau said that 11 types of detection conditions were selected for the intelligent image surveillance project, including statistics on pedestrian flow in the station area, abnormal stay/stay of personnel, excessive stay in specific areas, special service/safety warning list (operational use), and safety special list. (Police use), warning lines across the moon area, reverse travel on the escalator, remnant detection, fire detection, abnormal flow of people and abnormal entry of personnel/animals into the track.
The Railway Bureau pointed out that the surveillance system with image recognition capability can also use the application of data calculation to enable the terminal equipment to intercept passenger characteristics and use the AI artificial intelligence analysis to immediately send out alarm messages to notify the station or police. Personnel processing.
The Railway Bureau said that it is currently cooperating with the Taiwan Railway Bureau and the Railway Police Bureau to conduct a review together with the application of the station space and practical needs. It is hoped that the operational safety management needs can be selected and the economic projects can be selected. The setting principle can be applied to other stations at the station.
