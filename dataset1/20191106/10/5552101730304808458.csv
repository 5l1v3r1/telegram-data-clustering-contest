金獎導演鍾孟宏編導的新作《陽光普照》強勢問鼎本屆金馬獎，獲最佳影片、原著劇本、最佳男女主角、配角等11項提名。該片鏡文學投注田調資源，轉介少年犯關懷團體管道，並由鏡文學內容籌製總監張耀升擔任共同編劇。日前鍾孟宏與入圍金馬獎的主要演員上「金馬會客室」聊到共同編劇搭檔張耀升，幽默形容「找人寫劇本，其實就像找一個精神科醫師」，暢談2人合作祕辛。
《陽光普照》由本地風光、華文創、捌捌玖電影、鏡文學、聯聯看娛樂共同出資，導演鍾孟宏及鏡文學內容籌製總監張耀升共同撰寫劇本，張耀升也在片中客串鄰居一角。鍾孟宏在「金馬會客室」透露2人合作起源於另一部作品《陌生人》，雖然最後未拍成電影，但當時他心想「這個年輕人不錯」。
鍾孟宏表示：「其實我覺得找人寫劇本，比較像找一個精神科醫師，你講給他聽，他聽完1、2個小時後，收你費用聽你講話，我覺得這個過程滿好、滿療癒的，他會找出一個東西點化你，這是我以前在沒人管的情況下很難得、非常有幫助的。」
先前鍾孟宏接受本刊專訪時曾笑稱自己「難相處」，因為對作品的要求太高，並開玩笑說：「基本上我是一個很難相信別人的人，編劇跟我在一起相處應該是滿難過的事情，因為可能每個人跟我相處超過10分鐘就覺得『我要回去』，或是半天就覺得差不多了，再下去的話，生命會有危險。」

接著他透露：「因為我工作大部分都是一個人，對我來講，我也滿痛苦的，要跟另一個人工作，而且是這麼長的時間。但有個好處是，編劇是我很好的傾聽對象，所以編劇對我而言，我最需要的就是『傾聽』，某種程度他就好像是一位醫療師，聽我說『我覺得怎樣怎樣』。」
鍾孟宏及張耀升以《陽光普照》共同入圍本屆金馬獎「最佳原著劇本」，張耀升除擔任鏡文學內容籌製總監，亦身兼小說家、演員、編劇、導演等多重身分，曾獲時報文學獎小說首獎等獎項，小說入選九歌出版社《華文小說百年選》、天下文化出版社《天下小說選：世界中文小說》，於2010年執行雲門舞集流浪者計畫，至日本國境最北貧窮旅行3個月，2015年起與小說家伊格言等人共同參與線上文學電子雜誌《外邊世界》。
今（6日）金馬影展官方臉書公開原著劇本、改編劇本入圍者訪談內容，張耀升表示：「編劇真的是一個非常辛苦的工作，我覺得過勞的程度比拍片現場超班狀況還要嚴重。因為你可能自己一個人在家裡面，其實是不停地超班，甚至腦力都用完了，還要設法突破自己。而且創作最難的一個部分是，你不能重複，今天寫出這個100分的東西，這個100分就是你下次的60分。」
