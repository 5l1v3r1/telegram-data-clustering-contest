      <p>LONDON, Nov 6 — European shares took a breather today after closing at a four-year peak in the previous session, as a mixed bag of earnings reports and weak services sector data from the euro zone weighed on sentiment.</p>
      <p>Societe Generale shares rose 4.6 per cent to a six-month high after the bank said it had set aside three-quarters of the cash needed to deliver a planned dividend payout this year.</p>
      <p>The update helped power a one per cent rise in bank stocks, the most among the major European sub-sectors. The pan-European STOXX 600 index struggled for direction after rising about 0.1 per cent in early trading.</p>
      <p>European shares have logged strong gains this week on growing optimism over a trade truce between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>Fresh data today showed Germany’s services sector barely grew in October, while euro zone business activity expanded slightly faster than expected last month, but remained close to stagnation.</p>
      <p>“There is a little bit of a holding pattern after the optimism we saw on the trade front and the effect is just slowly wearing off,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.</p>
      <p>“There is also a nagging sense that maybe this market has moved too fast too quickly so we could just move lower on some short-term weakness.”</p>
      <p>The European retail sector gained 0.3 per cent after better-than-expected earnings from Britain’s Marks and Spencer and Dutch supermarket operator Ahold Delhaize.</p>
      <p>Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut fell four per cent after reporting a slowdown in its most recent quarter, while Italy’s postal service provider Poste Italiane dropped 1.2 per cent due to a lacklustre performance of its mail and parcel business in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Shares of Norwegian Air fell nine per cent after the struggling budget carrier conducted its third share issue in less than two years late yesterday. — Reuters</p>
