頂新案三審宣判　魏應充遭判5年9月定讞
06 Nov 2019, 10:43 by 劉志原, 陳毅偉
頂新前董事長魏應充在油品案中，從無罪到遭改依涉犯71次《食安法》判刑15年，最高法院今（6日）認為，其中26項犯行事證明確，駁回上訴，其中7罪刑期總合共5年9個月，魏應充將再入獄，另19項有罪確定的部分，則可以易科罰金；另有45罪因一審漏未判決，檢方上訴不合法，二審是違法判決，發回更審。



對於魏應充的上訴理由中指出二審法院錯誤解讀越南公文、檢方採證錯誤、未告知同案被告大幸福公司負責人楊振益可行使緘默權屬不當取供及頂新油品是安全可供食用的等4大爭議點上訴，最高法院大都不採信，幾乎都認同二審的見解。
最高法院合議庭指出，魏應充等人上訴意旨中，提到證據能力、《食安法》適用、大幸福公司原料油品非欠缺供人食用品質及可精煉以製成供人食用產品、大幸福公司不需要取得食品安全證書、陳茂嘉及魏應充無犯罪故意等的說法，以及對二審採證認事的職權行使，最高法院認為，這些有的在二審判決已說明，有的是對判決無影響的枝節事項。
最高法院判決，魏應充共有26個犯行有罪確定，其中7罪刑期總合共5年9個月，魏應充將再入獄，另19項有罪確定的部分，則可以易科罰金，至於易科罰金數額及合併執行刑度，因魏應充之前因另件油品案已遭判2年，並入獄1年9個月後獲假釋，全案將再另定合併執行刑。
此外，原本魏應充在二審遭認定有罪的45個犯行，最高法院認為，這45罪一審漏未判決，檢察官上訴第二審的效力自不及於此，二卻判有罪，已屬違法判決，因此予以發回；至於被告聲請提案予刑事大法庭部分，合議庭認為，不具原則重要性，均無提案必要，應認不備法定要件，予以駁回。
