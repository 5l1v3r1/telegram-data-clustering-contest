The Norwegian prodigy became the highest-scoring teenager in a single Champions League campaign when he scored in his side's 1-1 draw with Napoli on Tuesday.
As reported by Marca, the 19-year-old netted his seventh UCL goal of the campaign against the Serie A side, and in doing so, broke the record previously held by Mbappe and Raul Gonzalez for the most Champions League goals by a teenager in a single season.

Haaland's tally of seven strikes simultaneously broke the record for the most goals scored after four games, and also saw him become only the fourth player in the tournament's history to net in each of his first four UCL appearances, after Ze Carlos, Alessandro Del Piero and Diego Costa.
The Norway international is the leading goalscorer in the UCL this season, ahead of second-placed Robert Lewandowski, who has scored five times in the competition for Bayern Munich so far.
