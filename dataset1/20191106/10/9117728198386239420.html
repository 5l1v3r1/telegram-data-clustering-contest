      <p>There looked to be some growing tension between the pair after their opening lap coming together at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/mexican-grand-prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a>. Hamilton would go on to win that race and he sealed his sixth World Championship at the US Grand Prix a week later.Â </p>
      <p>The Brit has revealed he wanted to squash any growing tension between them, before they took to the COTA circuit and said that he is a champion of the future.</p>
      <p><i>"I spoke to Max even before the race and I was like, 'Dude you're such a great racer, man. Let's just squash whatever there is between us because it's just fake, it's nothing. Whatever beef [there is] let's just get rid of it. Let's go out there and have a great race',"</i> Hamilton told Channel 4.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"He's a champion of the future and I'm going to work as hard as I can to stop that happening for a while, but I'm enjoying racing with him."</i>
