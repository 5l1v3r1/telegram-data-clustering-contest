A disqualified Karnataka MLA has claimed that BS Yediyurappa had given him Rs 1,000 crore in exchange of his support to make the state’s chief minister once again.  Narayana Gowda said that the money that he received from Yediyurappa was being spent towards the development of his constituency Krishnarajpet.



“Somebody came to me and took me to BS Yediyurappa’s residence at 5 am (before the HD Kumaraswamy government fell). When we entered his home, Yediyurappa was worshiping. Once I entered, he asked me to sit and asked me to support him so that he can become the chief minister once again,” reported NDTV quoting news agency ANI.
Gowda said that he asked Yediyurappa to ‘allot Rs 700 crores for the development of Krishnarajpet constituency’ adding that the BJP leader offered to pay him Rs 300 crores more’ making the total sum Rs 1,000 crores. “He also provided that money afterwards. Don’t you think I should support such a great person, I did it. Right after Yediyurappa said we got nothing to do with disqualified MLAs,” Gowda was quoted as saying.





This claim by Gowda comes just days after a video of Yediyurappa went viral whereby he was heard saying that plan to topple the then HD Kumaraswamy government was orchestrated by Home Minister Amit Shah.
Gowda also claimed that a former JD-S MLA, who was also disqualified, made a statement in Mandya saying that ‘he supported the Yediyurappa government for the funds to develop his constituency.’
