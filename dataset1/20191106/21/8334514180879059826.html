      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - A partial ceiling collapse at London’s Piccadilly Theatre on Wednesday halted a performance of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman,” causing a few minor injuries and prompting an evacuation of the audience.</p>
      <p>Police were called just before 8 p.m. (1959 GMT) to the West End theater where American actor Wendell Pierce was starring as Willy Loman in a production of the 1949 play.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is out of the theater. A few people have suffered minor injuries,” police said in a statement. London Fire Brigade said 1,100 people had been evacuated after a section of plaster fell from the ceiling.</p>
      <p>“I did not mean for it to go like this,” Pierce, known for his work in the TV show “The Wire” and the 2014 film “Selma,” told theatergoers in a video posted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to thank you all for safely evacuating. We apologize and we’re glad that no-one’s hurt.”</p>
