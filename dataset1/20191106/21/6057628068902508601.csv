France targets migrants because they do not work
06 Nov 2019, 21:28 by Abdurrahman Gambo Ahmad, Abdoulkarim Ibrahim

The French government has announced a plan to recruit highly-skilled immigrants in various fields, enabling them to find jobs in the country, a program that will begin work early next year.

Minister of Labor Muriel Pinacaud, who emphasizes the program, says it is a policy the French government is planning to implement to fill the nation's shortage of skilled workers as it does in other countries, including Canada and Australia. .
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has informed his ministers and parliamentarians on a plan for his government on how to formulate a system for receiving migrants, after nearly eight years of deliberation. the kind of people who should be given access to France to study and find jobs.
Seven years after the launch of the program, France will receive 500,000 foreign students for study and employment prospects in the country, which is the fifth largest international student population.
However, it seems likely that this plan could lead to secession from the French government, because there are those who oppose the plan.
