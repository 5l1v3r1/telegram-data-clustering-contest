生活費兩元 吳花燕事件詰問中國「扶貧」

06 Nov 2019, 21:51

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】近日，貴州大學生吳花燕每日生活費僅兩元人民幣，因貧致病的事件披露後，引發輿論廣泛關註。在每年軍費超萬億的中國，為什麽還有大學生靠每天兩塊錢長期生活？中國的扶貧制度出了什麽問題？
「醫院就說我是營養不良」，這是吳花燕面對媒體采訪時的口述。
吳花燕的遭遇在中國民間引來廣泛同情，同時也讓中國貧困問題再次曝光在大眾面前。
中國在改革開放的四十年中，通過發展經濟和各種政府項目，大幅度減少了貧困人口，贏得世界贊譽。但根據世界銀行最新數據，到2017年為止，按照國家貧困線的標準，中國還有3.1%的人口處於貧困線以下，人數超過三千萬。這些人口的年均收入在兩千三百元人民幣以下。
自八十年代以來，中國政府采取了多種扶貧措施，也多次調整扶貧政策。2013年，中國國家主席習近平在湖南湘西考察期間，提出了「精準扶貧」的方針。自那以來，中央及地方各級政府以此為思路，展開扶貧工作。
但熟悉湘西地區的人口學專家易富賢告訴本台記者，至少從湘西的情況來看，目前的扶貧措施還很有局限。
易富賢：「這種格局是一個小格局，我是在湖南湘西，湘西這個地方貧困的最大問題是沒有年輕人，這樣地方經濟就發展不起來。政府就要持續的輸血，這種方法是不可持續的。」
長期關註中國貧困問題的民營企業家胡力任，曾多次考察貧困人口集中的貴州省。他指出，地方政府在對待扶貧款的使用上也存在問題。
胡力任：「所有的扶貧資金進入這些所謂的貧困地區，是不會全額到底層貧困人口手中的，都是被當地政府克扣了。比方說，有五個億進去以後，就以當地做建設的名義把這些錢拿出來了，比方說修路等等。」
與此同時，中國社會的貧富差距日益拉大。據倫敦政治經濟學院今年4月發表的一份統計報告，中國收入位居50%以下的群體在社會總收入中所占比例，從1978年的27%下降到2015年的15%。這個比例，高於美國的12%，而低於法國的22%。
根據國際貨幣基金組織去年曾指出，顯示居民收入分配不均的一般標準基尼系數，中國從1990年以來上升了十五個基點，達到五十。中國已從1990年適度不平等的國家，進入了最不平等的國家行列。
在這一背景下，中國國家領導人習近平在不同場合多次強調，要在2020年徹底消除中國的絕對貧苦人口。
易富賢認為，這種提法並不現實：「這可能是從國家某一個層面來說的，但從具體來說，這是不可能實現的，你不可能很當真。怎麽可能啊？這麽一個大國。目前國家三、五年的政策，你沒有改變根本的面貌，沒有發展起來，必然會有貧困。」
中國澎湃新聞社也早在今年初的一篇報道中指出，無論是國際的還是中國的貧困人口，統計口徑不斷在變化。即使是2020年消除了統計口徑上的絕對貧困人口，依然有大批相對貧困人口存在，中國的扶貧任務依然任重道遠。
胡力任則指出，目前中國政府所制定的扶貧標準也有問題：「我們所謂的脫貧，不僅僅是一個吃飽飯的問題，應該是包括醫療、教育等所有方面，都需要有一個完善的機制，這個才叫脫貧。打個比方，你沒有受到良好教育，你只是吃飽了，你能說你脫貧了嗎？」
獲得今年諾貝爾經濟學獎的美國麻省理工大學教授埃斯特·迪弗洛和阿比吉特·班納吉在研究中指出，貧困的境遇導致窮人無法獲取有效的生活信息，在生活中無法擺脫各種困境，這是他們致貧的主要原因。

Two yuan of living expenses Wu Huayan’s incident asked China’s “Poverty Alleviation”

06 Nov 2019, 21:51

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] Recently, Guizhou University student Wu Huayan’s daily living expenses were only two yuan. After the disclosure of the disease caused by poverty, public opinion was widely concerned. In China, where military spending exceeds one trillion yuan each year, why do college students live on long-term two dollars a day? What is wrong with China’s poverty alleviation system?
""The hospital said that I am malnourished."" This is the dictation of Wu Huayan's interview with the media.
Wu Huayan’s experience has attracted widespread sympathy in China, and it has also exposed China’s poverty problem to the public.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, China has greatly reduced the number of poor people and won world acclaim by developing the economy and various government projects. However, according to the latest data from the World Bank, by 2017, according to the national poverty line standards, 3.1% of China's population is below the poverty line, with more than 30 million people. The average annual income of these people is below 2,300 yuan.
Since the 1980s, the Chinese government has adopted a variety of poverty alleviation measures and has repeatedly adjusted its poverty alleviation policies. In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the policy of “precise poverty alleviation” during the inspection tour of Hunan Xiangxi. Since then, central and local governments have used this as their way of thinking to carry out poverty alleviation work.
However, Yi Fuxian, a demographic expert familiar with the Xiangxi area, told this reporter that at least from the situation in Xiangxi, the current poverty alleviation measures are still very limited.
Yi Fuxian: ""This pattern is a small pattern. I am in Xiangxi, Hunan. The biggest problem of poverty in this part of Xiangxi is that there are no young people, so the local economy will not develop. The government will continue to transfuse blood. This method is unsustainable.""
Hu Liren, a private entrepreneur who has long been concerned about poverty in China, has repeatedly visited Guizhou Province where poverty is concentrated. He pointed out that local governments also have problems in the use of poverty alleviation funds.
Hu Liren: ""All the poverty alleviation funds entering these so-called poverty-stricken areas will not be fully in the hands of the underprivileged people. They are all deducted by the local government. For example, after five hundred million yuan, they will be built in the name of local construction. Take out the money, for example, road repairs, etc.""
At the same time, the gap between the rich and the poor in Chinese society is growing. According to a statistical report published by the London School of Economics and Political Science in April this year, the proportion of social income in China with a population below 50% fell from 27% in 1978 to 15% in 2015. This ratio is higher than 12% in the US and lower than 22% in France.
According to the International Monetary Fund last year, the Gini coefficient, a general standard showing the uneven distribution of income among residents, has risen by 15 basis points since 1990 to 50. China has entered the ranks of the most unequal countries from countries with moderate inequalities in 1990.
In this context, Chinese national leader Xi Jinping repeatedly stressed on different occasions that in 2020, China’s absolute poor population will be completely eliminated.
Yi Fuxian believes that this formulation is not realistic: ""This may be from a certain level of the country, but in concrete terms, this is impossible to achieve, you can not be very serious. How is it possible? A big country. At present, the national three- or five-year policy, you have not changed the fundamental face, and if you do not develop, there will inevitably be poverty.""
China’s Yushe News Agency also pointed out in a report earlier this year that the statistical caliber is constantly changing, both internationally and in China’s poor population. Even in 2020, the absolute poverty population on the statistical scale has been eliminated, and there are still a large number of relatively poor people. China’s poverty alleviation task still has a long way to go.
Hu Liren pointed out that the current poverty alleviation standards set by the Chinese government also have problems: ""The so-called poverty alleviation is not only a matter of eating a full meal, but should include all aspects of medical care and education. We need a perfect mechanism. It’s called poverty alleviation. For example, you are not well educated, you are just full, can you say that you are out of poverty?”
In this study, Esther Difflo and Abigit Banerji, professors of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won this year's Nobel Prize in Economics, pointed out that the situation of poverty has made the poor unable to obtain effective life information in life. It is impossible to get rid of all kinds of difficulties, which is the main reason for their poverty.
