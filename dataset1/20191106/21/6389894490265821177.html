      <h1>Airbnb has promised to verify all of its properties - 11 years after it was founded</h1>

      <p>Airbnb has said it will verify all properties on its website, after an investigation uncovered a series of scam listings.</p>
      <p>Last month, Vice News revealed a string of false or misleading rental properties posted on the platform.</p>
      <p>The tech company said it would review every property by December next year. It also said it would refund customers who had been scammed by dodgy listings.</p>
      <p>This is the first instance of the 11-year-old company promising to verify each home advertised on its platform.</p>
      <p>Over the course of its investigation, Vice spoke to people who had faced exactly that predicament. When they arrived for their holiday, they typically received a phone call from the landlord, warning them at the last minute that the property was no longer available. This was usually put down to an emergency or a double-booking.</p>
      <p>Holidaymakers would then be transferred to a difference property – but this would often be in a completely different area, and would lack the amenities the original booking had promised.</p>
      <p>Some guests felt they had no choice but to stay for at least one night, having arrived late in the day in a city far away from home. However, they claimed Airbnb then declined to give them a refund, despite the misleading bookings.</p>
      <p>Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky said: “Airbnb is in the business of trust. We are making the most significant steps in designing trust on our platform since our original design in 2008.”</p>
      <p>He said that by December next year, “every home and every host on Airbnb will have been reviewed”.</p>
      <p>“If a guest checks into a listing and it doesn’t meet our accuracy standards, we will rebook them into a listing that is just as nice,” he said, adding that if this was not possible they would get a full refund.</p>
      <p>“We are launching a 24/7 neighbor hotline so anyone can call us anytime, anywhere in the world and reach a real person. This hotline will be led by our rapid response team.”</p>
