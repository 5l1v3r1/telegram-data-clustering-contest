Learn to create great graphics with Gravit Designer Pro

06 Nov 2019, 21:00




Launching into a graphic design career can be intimidating. What software do you use? How do you use it? One option that’s presented itself this week is to leave complexity behind and jump into a one-year Gravit Designer Pro subscription for just $39.
Gravit Designer offers all of the same features as the other top vector software packages such as Affinity Designer, Adobe Illustrator, and Sketch but without the price tag. Gravit features a beginner-friendly interface to help you create more and struggle less.
Access your designs from anywhere.
Unlike many vector programs, Gravit Designer is web-based. You can access your designs from any device with internet connectivity. You can design on Linux, Windows, an iPad, or even your phone. When you don’t have a connection, just hop into the desktop app and work from anywhere.
Mastering vector artwork will help you create designs at any size. You can create a graffiti wall or a tiny app icon with ease. You can even keep all of your designs safe with the unlimited cloud storage included with a pro subscription. If you’re looking for templates, you’ll find that everything Gravit offers can be resized for any project.
Gravit Designer Pro highlights:

Easily create graphics for any size project.
Utilize the desktop app or work online from anywhere.
Protect your designs and access from any device with unlimited cloud storage.
Work with top features that you expect in Sketch, Affinity Designer, or Adobe Illustrator.
Save custom colors and use them in all of your work.

Adobe Illustrator alone costs $240 per year, each version of Affinity Designer costs $50, but one year of Gravit Designer Pro is just $39 for a limited time. This software retails at $99 per year, so you can save 60% and jump right into a beginner-friendly design future. There are similarly great savings on the two-year or three-year plans with the same deal.
This deal is only temporary, so hit the button below to check it out for yourself and start getting creative.

Get the deal!
