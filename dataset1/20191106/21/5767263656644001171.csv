20+ Animals Who Know How to Strike a Pose

06 Nov 2019, 21:30

Our pets don’t need to try too hard to make us go “Aww.” However, some of them have built up this skill and are running at 200%, especially when it comes to a sweet pose. Some sit right on the head or paws of other animals, while others can stand or lie in a way that makes their owners rush to get their camera. It seems like all of them have graduated from modeling school, otherwise, how can one explain their talents?
We at Bright Side melted looking at each shot from these posers and admire the ability of people to capture these moments.
