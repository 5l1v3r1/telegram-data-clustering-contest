      <p>SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — A San Diego International Airport spokesperson said Wednesday a reported paging that went viral was made by mistake.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Brick_Suit/status/1191873539361525760?s=20">Video</a> on Twitter claimed to show San Diego Airport's messaging system announce a page for "Epstein Coverup" on a digital display. The text read: "Airport is paging Epstein Coverup please meet your party at terminal two east by American Airlines."</p>
      <p>An airport spokesperson told 10News that the message was a mistake, and steps were "being taken to avoid such mistakes in the future."</p>
      <p>"San Diego International Airport’s paging system is a vital communications resource for airport users in a sometimes busy, hectic environment. Airport users depend on this system to reach loved ones or receive notifications in a timely manner. In this instance, our employee made a mistake. Steps are being taken to avoid such mistakes in the future," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Earlier Tuesday, a video was posted online of <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/national/abc-says-interview-with-epstein-accuser-wasnt-ready-to-air">ABC anchor Amy Robach venting</a> about how an interview with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre never aired. The clip shows Robach ranting about how the story, shot in 2015, was handled.</p>
      <p>ABC said Tuesday that the interview didn't meet its standards because it lacked sufficient corroborating evidence, denying outside pressure had anything to do with the decision.</p>
      <p>In response, social media users started spreading the "Epstein Coverup" hashtag online.</p>
      <p>Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in August. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging by the New York medical examiner.</p>
