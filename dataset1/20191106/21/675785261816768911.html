      <h2>Son was devastated after his challenge left Everton midfielder Gomes needing surgery on a broken and dislocated ankle during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Goodison Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:29:41+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Son Heung-min appeared to apologise to Andre Gomes after scoring for Tottenham in their Champions League clash at Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Son was devastated after his challenge left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder Gomes needing surgery on a broken and dislocated ankle during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The South Korean was sent off, a decision which has since been overturned by the Football Association, and the club have been providing support for him.</p>
      <p>Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino opted to hand Son a starting spot in his squad on Wednesday and the forward delivered the goods by netting a brace in the encounter.</p>

      <p>After scoring his first goal, which was a well-worked team effort, Son went towards camera and said sorry down the lens, presumably aimed at Gomes, and also appeared to pray for the injured Portuguese midfielder.</p>
      <p>Son is yet to speak publicly about the incident, although Pochettino revealed on Tuesday that the player "was devastated after the action".</p>
      <p>Just hours before Son's apology, Gomes thanked people who have sent him well wishes as he recovers at home following ankle surgery.</p>
      <p>He had an operation on Monday, which was said to have gone "extremely well", and on Wednesday the Portugal international provided his first public comments since the incident.</p>

      <p>In a video message on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account, he said: "Hi everyone. As you already know, everything went well.</p>
      <p>"I'm already at home with my family and I would like to thank you all for the support, the messages and the positive energy. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Gomes is expected to be sidelined for anywhere between six months and a year given the seriousness of the injury, which left players from both sides visibly upset on the pitch at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> forward Son Heung-min, who has sent off for conceding the foul which led to Gomes' injury, had his suspension overturned by the Football Association on Tuesday.</p>
