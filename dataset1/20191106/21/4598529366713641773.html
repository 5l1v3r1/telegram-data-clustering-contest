      <p>Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has finally rustled up some lawyers of his own as his role in the Ukraine scandal grows ever clearer.</p>

      <p>Giuliani has been without representation,<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/giuliani-defense-attorney-ukraine"> though in the market,</a> since he and attorney Jon Sale parted ways in October.</p>
      <p>He has denied a congressional subpoena to testify about his role at the center of the pressure campaign to coerce Ukraine to manufacture a scandal centering on the Bidens.</p>
      <p>Costello’s name may sound familiar due to a conversation he had with Michael Cohen in 2018. In emails provided to Congress and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/13/politics/michael-cohen-email-costello/index.html">obtained by CNN,</a> he said that Giuliani could “sleep well tonight” because he had “friends in high places,” a seeming allusion to a presidential pardon.</p>
      <p>Costello, who has been friends with Giuliani for decades, called that interpretation of the conversation “nonsense.” He was reportedly considering representing Cohen for a time.</p>
