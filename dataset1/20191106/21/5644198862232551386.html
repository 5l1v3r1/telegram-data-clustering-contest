      <p>U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday following a Reuters report the U.S.-China trade deal could be delayed until December.</p>
      <p>NEW YORK: U.S. stocks were near flat on Wednesday as a report that the U.S.-China deal could be delayed until December increased worries about how long the trade war will go on, while healthcare shares supported the market.</p>
      <p>A senior official of the Trump administration told Reuters a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a long-awaited interim trade deal could be delayed until December, as discussions continue over terms and a venue.</p>

      <p>Stocks were also on pause after their recent run to record highs.</p>
      <p>The year end is typically a bullish time for stocks, but the trade war is still a risk, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>Also, "there's been concern the market was moving toward overbought conditions," she said.</p>
      <p>Humana Inc rose 3.9per cent as the health insurer reported quarterly profit that beat estimates on higher sales of its government-backed Medicare Advantage health plans.</p>
