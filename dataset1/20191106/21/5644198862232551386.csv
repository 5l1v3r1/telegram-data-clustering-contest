Stocks were also on pause after their recent run to record highs.
The year end is typically a bullish time for stocks, but the trade war is still a risk, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

Humana Inc rose 3.9per cent as the health insurer reported quarterly profit that beat estimates on higher sales of its government-backed Medicare Advantage health plans.
CVS Health Corp gained 4.9per cent after the pharmacy chain posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by its Aetna health insurance business and pharmacy benefit management unit.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.91 points, or 0.01per cent, to 27,489.72, the S&P 500 lost 0.21 points, or 0.01per cent, to 3,074.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 28.29 points, or 0.34per cent, to 8,406.39.
