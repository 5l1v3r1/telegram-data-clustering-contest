      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) â€” The Republican Party of Kentucky has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against a radio host who is considering a run to unseat U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>
      <p>The complaint, filed Tuesday, seeks an investigation of Matt Jones, <a href="https://apnews.com/31fa5a27d39240359f4eba505f7064d2">who has announced</a> an exploratory committee to run as a Democrat in next year's Senate race. Another Democrat, <a href="https://apnews.com/fd2f738e59974dad9ec227bd1d7ad132">Amy McGrath</a> , has already filed to run.</p>
      <p>The complaint alleges Jones is already a candidate and is using his statewide sports radio show to promote himself. The complaint cites "egregious violations" of federal campaign finance law concerning corporate contributions.</p>
      <p>In a tweeted response Wednesday, Jones said McConnell is trying to get his radio show, which has 50 affiliates around the state, "off the air immediately with this complaint."</p>
      <p>"It's nonsense and I am not even a candidate at this time for office," Jones said.</p>
      <p>The complaint alleges that iHeartMedia, the company that syndicates Jones' radio show, is making "in-kind" contributions to his campaign by airing his opinions of McConnell on his show. The complaint also says Jones' book publisher is paying for Jones to take a tour around the state.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Jones used his radio show to broadcast the statewide tour, which serves to promote both his candidacy and his campaign-related book," the complaint said.</p>
      <p>The document, filed by GOP state chairman J. McCauley Brown, says Jones is already a candidate in the Senate race because he has filed a federal "statement of candidacy" form. But the document designates his campaign committee as "Matt Jones for Kentucky Exploratory Committee."</p>
      <p>Jones has said on his radio show that his decision on whether to enter the 2020 campaign would come after the <a href="https://apnews.com/005d656cff9542cbafec1fa8001ec1f1">statewide elections</a> in Kentucky, which were held Tuesday.</p>
      <p>McConnell is running for a seventh term. A fellow Republican, Gov. Matt Bevin, <a href="https://apnews.com/b29352c2c9594e68a4a944e8c2bd4abb">was refusing</a> on Wednesday to concede his bid for reelection to Democratic challenger and Attorney General Andy Beshear. Beshear was leading by a little more than 5,000 votes of more than 1.4 million counted, a margin of less than 0.4 percentage points.</p>
      <p>Bevin has asked for a recanvass of vote totals.</p>
