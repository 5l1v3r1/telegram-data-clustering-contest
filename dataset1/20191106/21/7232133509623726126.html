      <p>Bitcoin’s price has been slowly inching higher after briefly visiting its range lows around $9,000 this past weekend, but in order for bulls to maintain their growing strength, it is imperative that they push BTC past its range high resistance level at $9,500.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting that the bull case for Bitcoin may be growing stronger, as the crypto has begun finding strong support at a key technical level and has been incurring increasing on-chain volume – factors that could help push the crypto higher in the near-term.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Inches Higher as Trading Volume Climbs</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/05/bull-trend-may-end-of-bitcoin-price-falls-under-7800-indicator-shows/">Bitcoin</a> is trading up just under 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $9,375, which marks a slight climb from its daily lows of just under $9,300.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-05/did-the-bitcoin-bubble-come-from-one-bitfinex-tether-trader">slow and steady climb</a> over the past few days was first sparked when BTC fell towards $9,100 this past weekend, and it has been slowly climbing back towards its range highs at $9,500 in the time since.</p>
      <p>How Bitcoin responds to its range highs in the near $9,500 in the near-term will offer investors and analysts alike significant insight into which direction the cryptocurrency will trend in the near-term, as a failure to decisively break above this level could spell trouble for which direction it trends in the near-term.</p>
      <p>One factor that could aid Bitcoin’s bulls is the fact that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/06/bitcoin-likely-to-break-past-10000-in-next-bout-of-price-volatility/">crypto</a> has seen increasing trading volume over the past 24-hours despite there not being any major shift in price, which could mean that a big movement in imminent.</p>
      <blockquote>“24H #BTC Network Stats: Price: $9354.9 (+0.8%). $BTC On-Chain Volume: $8B (+38.2%). Active Senders: 523K (+6.6%). Active Recipients: 563K (+2.5%),” TokenAnalyst explained in a recent tweet, explaining that BTC’s 24-hour trading volume has climbed nearly 40%.</blockquote>

      <h3>BTC Holds Above Key Technical Level; Further Gains May Be Inbound</h3>
      <p>Big Cheds, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that BTC has been holding above a key technical level for the past several days, which may bolster its price action in the coming days and weeks as the bullish undercurrent grows stronger.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC #Bitcoin Daily – Seems to be establishing EMA 8 uptrend support,” he explained while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <p>The coming few days will likely illuminate Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/02/bitcoin-use-growing/">mid-term trend</a>, as how it reacts to its current support and resistance levels will set the tone for which direction it moves in the coming days and weeks.</p>
