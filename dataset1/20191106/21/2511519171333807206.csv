Tottenham Hotspur play Red Star Belgrade this evening, needing to win to boost their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages.
Spurs reached the final in Madrid last season but have made an underwhelming start to this season’s tournament, drawing with Olympiacos and then being hammered at home by Bayern Munich.
But their confidence was boosted by beating today’s opponents Red Star 5-0 at home at the end of October – although the Serbian side are likely to be a different proposition in their own backyard. Follow live coverage below, after updates from Lokomotiv vs Juventus.
Red Star vs Tottenham key points   •  Red Star Belgrade: Borjan, Gobeljic, Milunovic, Degenek, Rodic, Jovancic, Petrovic, Garcia, Marin, van La Parra, Pavkov.   •  Subs: Popovic, Pankov, Vulic, Richmond Boakye, Jander, Simic, Canas.   •  Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Foyth, Sanchez, Dier, Rose, Sissoko, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Alli, Son, Kane.   •  Subs: Alderweireld, Vorm, Sessegnon, Eriksen, Lucas Moura, Skipp, Davies.   •  Referee: Carlos Del Cerro (Spain)

2019-11-06T20:49:54.803ZThat was a strange 45 minutes of play. Nothing seemed to happen for long periods and then out of nothing absolute chaos. It happened twice.  Tottenham managing to find the back of the net with their attempt and Red Star failing with theirs. As both teams want the three points expect a more focussed line of attack in the second half.
