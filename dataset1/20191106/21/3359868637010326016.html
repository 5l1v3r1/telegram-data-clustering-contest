      <h2>Vertical Research Partners describes the stock of Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. as a “one-of-a-kind opportunity to invest in space tourism.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T21:24:52+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author">Teuta Franjkovic</a></address>
      <p>Vertical Research Partners is the first company that started covering <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/virgin-galactic/">Virgin Galactic</a>, the space company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson. They gave it a “buy” rating and said its risk “is misunderstood.”</p>
      <p>In his letter to investors analyst Darryl Genovesi <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/analyst-buy-virgin-galactic-stock-because-risk-is-misunderstood.html">wrote</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“We think the technical risk to SPCE’s human spaceflight program is less draconian than the stock appears to be pricing in.”</blockquote>
      <p>Virgin Galactic had its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bransons-virgin-galactic-nyse/">IPO</a> last week, following the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-goes-public/">realization</a> of its merger with Chamath Palihapitiya’s company Social Capital Hedosophia.</p>
      <p>Genovesi says Virgin Galactic, ticker ‘SPCE,’ is remarkable for being the only stock that investors can trade in a “niche but growing market.”</p>
      <p>He explains:</p>
      <blockquote>“SPCE is the only means by which a public equity investor may gain pure-play exposure to human spaceflight, a socially-important endeavour, and the only means by which a public equity investor may gain ANY exposure to space tourism, creating scarcity value that we think can drive the stock higher as the risk-profile becomes better understood by investors.”</blockquote>
      <p>Shares of Virgin Galactic initially rose in trading on Tuesday following Genovesi’s call. However, the day after, at the time of writing, the stock slipped 1.34% and it is currently trading at $9.57 per share. Vertical Research said the share price target is $20 that is more than double than its current price.</p>
      <p>As we had previously reported, the company was founded back in 2004 and has spent more than $1bn developing its program, which is far behind what was previously expected, and took a hit after a fatal accident in 2014.</p>
      <p>For 2023, the company is predicting to make 270 trips to space, which would get it around $600m and generate a profit of more than $430m.</p>
      <p>Genovesi commented the safety risk has a significant weight on Virgin Galactic’s stock price, saying “the market appears to imply a high probability of failure, higher than we believe is appropriate.”</p>
      <p>He also funnily said that investors are using “a Space Shuttle like crash rate” in order to estimate Virgin Galactic’s potential failure rate.</p>
      <p>Vertical Research partners sees Virgin Galactic’s spacecraft possibly comparable to the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft made in cooperation of NASA and the US Air Force in the 1960s. The X-15 crashed once in 199 flights, a crash rate of 0.5%. Comparing to it, the Space Shuttle had two fatal accidents in 135 flights, a slightly bigger crash rate of 1.5%. But that isn’t an accurate comparison, Genovesi said adding that this happened 5- years ago.</p>
      <p>Nearly 600 people, including some celebrities like Justin Bieber, have already put down deposits for the 90-minute experience. The ticket for one person will cost about $250,000 per ticket.</p>
      <p>Genovesi repeated words said by Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides about the space tourism venture being a bet on the fast-growing luxury experiences market.</p>
