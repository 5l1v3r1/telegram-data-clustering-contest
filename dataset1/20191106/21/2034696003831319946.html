      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/red-hot-chili-peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>‘ Flea has discussed why his new memoir <i>Acid For The Children</i> doesn’t detail the band’s huge career.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited book, which was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/red-hot-chili-peppers-73-1237986">first announced in 2014</a>, finally hit shelves yesterday (November 5) and sees the bassist open up about his difficult childhood, past drug problems and more.</p>

      <p>Following its release, Flea – real name Michael Balzary – has revealed why he chose not to write too much about the Chilis in the autobiography, with the group only being introduced towards the end.</p>
      <p>“I thought if I wrote a book about the Chili Peppers, it’d be like cheating,” the musician told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50289879"><i>BBC News</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“But if I could write a book about my childhood that could exist on its own merits, without the band, then I deserved to write a book. That was the challenge I set for myself.”</p>

      <p>Flea went on to speak about RHCP playing their first show together under the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, with <i>Acid For The Children</i> concluding when the gig took place in 1983.</p>
      <p>Recalling how the group never took themselves seriously, Flea said: “When we started the band, everything was about what was funny to us. We really loved this song, so we came up with a dance routine in our living room, going, ‘This would be so fun!’</p>
      <p>“And, you know, it was the most fulfilling experience, artistically, that I’d ever had in my life.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/hes-looking-alpha-flea-hints-conflicted-relationship-red-hot-chili-peppers-bandmate-anthony-kiedis-2564644">Flea has touched upon his conflicted relationship with his fellow bandmate Anthony Kiedis</a>. Within his memoir, he describes the Red Hot Chilis frontman as “controlling”.</p>
