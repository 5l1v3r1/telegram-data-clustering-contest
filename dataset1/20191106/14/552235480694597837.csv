Angry paedophile hunters confronted a man at his East Kilbride home after he went looking for underage sex.
William Kennedy struck up an online relationship with a person he believed was a girl aged 14.
Hamilton Sheriff Court heard on Wednesday how the ‘girl’ was in fact an adult member of Child Protectors Scotland posing as a decoy.
Kennedy, 36, formerly of Mount Cameron Drive North, St Leonard’s, admitted sending messages of a sexual nature and an explicit photograph to ‘Dani’ in July last year.



He also admitted attempting to arrange a meeting with the ‘child’ in order to engage in unlawful sexual activity.
Kennedy has since moved but his new address was not disclosed in court.
Sheriff Ray Small called for a criminal justice social work report and a risk assessment, deferring sentence until December 18.
Kennedy, who has no previous convictions, was allowed to remain on bail and was placed on the sex offenders register with immediate effect.
