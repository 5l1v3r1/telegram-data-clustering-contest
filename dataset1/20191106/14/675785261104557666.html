      <h1>Man Utd transfer target Erling Braut Haaland wants Premier League move, says father</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian has been in remarkable goalscoring form this season, notching his 23rd of the season on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:17:52+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Red Bull Salzburg hotshot Erling Braut Haaland wants to play in the Premier League one day, according to his father Alf-Inge.</p>
      <p>The younger Haaland, 19, has turned heads with his remarkable goalscoring form this season, notching his 23rd strike of the campaign in Salzburg's 1-1 draw with Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>That took his tally to six goals in four European games this season, and has only increased speculation over his future amid links with several big names around Europe including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p>Alf-Inge - a former Premier League midfielder - believes that his son would suit the English top-flight, although stopped short of naming which club he'd like to join, adding that he simply supported the teams his dad played for when he was younger.</p>

      <p>“He was a Leeds fan and a City fan and a Nottingham Forest fan – he followed me obviously, but that is what you do in your youth," the former Norway international told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/625914/erling-haaland-premier-league-leeds-man-city-nottingham-forest-alf-inge/">talkSPORT</a> .</p>
      <p>“It is different being a supporter and having a job.</p>
      <p>“But he was born in Leeds.</p>

      <p>“At one stage he would like to play in the Premier League, but when that will happen, I don’t know. It is a very tough league.</p>
      <p>“Up to now he is ahead of the stage we thought he would be at. He is built for the Premier League, but whether that will happen now or at a later stage, we don’t know."</p>
      <p>Haaland senior added that he sees Salzburg - a club who helped launch the careers of the likes of Sadio Mane and Naby Keita - is the perfect environment for him to flourish in.</p>

      <p>“He is at Red Bull, a fantastic club playing Champions League so in a way he is in no hurry," he continued.</p>
      <p>“Red Bull have shown from the past that they are a ‘middle step’ club, and if they are going to recruit players in the future they can’t put a stupid price tag on the players because nobody would want to go there.”</p>
