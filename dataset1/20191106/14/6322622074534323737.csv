KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): London Biscuits Bhd has defaulted on principal payments to seven banks, amounting to a total of RM89.19 million.
The payment defaults range from RM4.33 million to RM29.87 million, owed to seven banks: Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, Bank of China (Malaysia) Bhd, Malayan Bank Bhd, United Overseas Bank Bhd, OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd, OCBC Al-Amin Bank Bhd and HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd, according to a company filing with Bursa Malaysia today.
London Biscuits attributed the default in payments to cashflow constraints, with the default dates between June 19 and Sept 20, 2019.
“The Company is currently assessing the significant impact of the default in payment on the business, financial and operations of the remaining business of the Group,” the biscuit manufacturer, which shares tanked to as low as five sen in the last one month, said.
The company fell into Practice Note 17 status on July 9, but remains asset rich.
As at June 30, 2019, its total assets amounted to RM812.48 million, translating to a net asset value per share of RM1.28.
Shares of London Biscuits closed unchanged at 5.5 sen today, valuing the company at RM16 million. Over the past year, the counter has lost nearly 89% of its value.
