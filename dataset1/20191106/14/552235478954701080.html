      <h1>Irvine Meadow 4 Benburb 3: Penalties galore as Medda edge seven goal thriller</h1>
      <h2>Reece Pearson’s spot kick 17 minutes from time was enough to clinch victory for the hosts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:23:33+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>A great game for neutrals but definitely not managers.</p>
      <p>That’s how Irvine Meadow boss Brian McGinty summed up an action packed 90 minutes that served up seven goals, four penalties and a glut of goalmouth action from start to finish.</p>
      <p>Only at the sound of the full-time whistle could McGinty finally relax as his side hung on for all three points that lifts them to second in the West Premiership.</p>
      <p>Meadow undoubtedly made life difficult for themselves, falling behind to an early goal then relinquishing a 3-1 lead in the second half.</p>
      <p>There was echoes of the Pollok stalemate a few weeks ago but Reece Pearson’s spot kick 17 minutes from time was enough to clinch victory.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinty insisted: “I thought we deserved to win over the course of the 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>“For the first 10 minutes or so we were sloppy and looked a bit leggy.</p>
      <p>“But after we went behind I thought we were excellent for the rest of the first half.</p>
      <p>“We created so many great chances and, in all honesty, if we’d gone in five or 6-1 up at half time I don’t think Benburb could have had any complaints.</p>

      <p>“We didn’t start the second half particularly well and they’ve scored twice to put us under a bit of pressure.</p>
      <p>“We stayed strong though and showed good character to get the win.”</p>
      <p>Benburb got off to the perfect start when Ryan McCrone blasted them in front from the penalty spot after only nine minutes.</p>
      <p>Meadow were awarded a penalty of their own five minutes later when Andy McLaughlin was brought down just inside the box but Mark McLennan's effort was saved by keeper Ross Connelly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before the home side were back on level terms however, McLaughlin expertly controlling the ball in mid-air and twisting to smash a first time volley into the net from 17 yards.</p>
      <p>Brendan Sharpe then showed some fine footwork to skip past a couple of Bens’ defenders before unleashing a low drive into the net from a similar distance.</p>
      <p>Meadow were now well on top and it was no surprise when they added a third goal 11 minutes before half-time.</p>
      <p>McLaughlin turned provider this time, pouncing on some defensive dithering to tee up Colin Spence for a simple side footed finish from 16 yards.</p>
      <p>Ryan Carnwath should have made it four when a low cross found him in acres of space at the back post but his shot from close range flew over the bar.</p>

      <p>Benburb started the second half on the front foot, striker James Marks tugging a shot wide of the target early on.</p>
      <p>The visitors then reduced the deficit in 50 minutes, Kieran McAllister’s free-kick sneaking under a defensive wall that leapt in unison and into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later it was all square after the award of a third penalty, McCrone once again making no mistake from the spot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It was end-to-end stuff and the award of yet another penalty – this time for Meadow – in 73 minutes settled the match. McLaughlin was felled again and Pearson sent the keeper the wrong way from 12 yards to make it 4-3.</p>
      <p>Benburb pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages, former Medda man Marks coming closest with a last-gasp free header that crept narrowly over the crossbar much to the relief of the home players and support.</p>
