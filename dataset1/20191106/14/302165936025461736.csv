SEOUL, Nov 6 — Korea’s flagship airline Korean Air has tapped the star power of K-pop group SuperM to appear in their new in-flight safety video.
Onboard safety instructions about seatbelts, electronic device restrictions and emergency exits are conveyed by seven dewy-faced boy band members who also provide the soundtrack to the video with their track Let’s Go Everywhere.
The video features a mix of five music genres — hip hop, R&B, electronic, deep house, and synth pop — in an effort to capture the attention of a wide range of passengers, says Korean Air.
The safety instructions are narrated by another K-pop star, singer BoA.
Along with celebrity appearances, the five-minute video takes passengers into the future of air travel with sleek, virtual images.
SuperM reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last month for their debut EP.
The song Let’s Go Everywhere will be released as a single November 18 and profits will go towards the Global Poverty Project’s Global Citizen campaign which works on issues like poverty, climate change and global inequality.
