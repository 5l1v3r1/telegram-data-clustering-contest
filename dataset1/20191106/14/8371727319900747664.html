      <h1>Twitter May Soon Let Users Disable Retweets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:15:40+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">George Kamau</a></address>
      <p>Twitter is working on bringing new features on its platform in a move to fight harassment on the social media giant. Right after <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/10/31/twitter-bans-political-ads-globally-november/">banning political ads</a>, Twitter is now exploring new features that they may or may not launch next year and here are the important and interesting ones.</p>
      <h3>Disable Retweet on your tweet</h3>
      <p>Twitter wants to bring a feature that disables retweet on your tweet so that malicious tweeps don’t take it out of context as a way to have healthy discourse on the platform and reduce the negative effects of the retweet button.</p>
      <p>The ability for your tweets to not be retweeted is only available if you make your account private.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">Buzzfeed</a> interview, Chris Wetherell, the developer who led the Twitter team that built the retweet button in 2009 said that the retweet button was similar to handing a 4-year-old a loaded weapon.</p>
      <h3>Disable mention without permission</h3>
      <p>Twitter is also exploring preventing users from mentioning you without your consent. When it is enabled, people won’t tag you in threads or random and abusive tweets and will be a welcome move as an anti-harassment feature in reducing negative mentions.</p>
      <p>Without your permission, you won’t be mentioned and you can remove yourself if you’re mentioned.</p>
      <h3>Tweet this only to: hashtag, interest, or these friends</h3>
      <p>This is another interesting feature that would let you tweet to select specific audiences such as enclosed chats and discussions.</p>
      <p>In a tweet poll, lots of people loved this idea.</p>

      <h3>Automatic Threads feature</h3>
      <p>For those of us who post threads, twitter is working on automatically labelling a thread and Twitter power users and social media managers are going to love it.</p>
