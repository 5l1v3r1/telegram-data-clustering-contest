      <p><b>CUPERTINO, Calif.Â (AP)</b> - Apple is expanding its website on privacy with more explanations about its commitments, though its policies and practices aren't changing.</p>
      <p>The new site Wednesday is part of Apple's ongoing push to distinguish itself from data-hungry, advertising-fueled rivals such as Google and Facebook.</p>
      <p>Apple's privacy website is mostly a users' guide with papers on how to prevent apps and other third-party services from unnecessarily tracking users' location and behaviors.</p>
      <p>The company's actual privacy policy hasn't changed.</p>
      <p>Many of the new privacy enhancements were announced earlier as part of Apple's iOS 13 software update for iPhones. Changes include the ability to sign in to third-party services with an Apple ID account rather than Facebook's or Google's, plus more notices and warnings about apps tapping location data.</p>
