      <p>Lawyers in Imo State have called on the Federal Government to intervene in the kidnap of Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of an Appeal Court sitting in Benin.</p>
      <p>The lawyers expressed made the call while speaking with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent in separate interviews in Owerri on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Chinonso Chikaire, one of the lawyers, expressed worry over the kidnap of Mrs Nwosu-Iheme and called on security agencies and other concerned bodies to weigh in on the matter.</p>
      <p>Mr Chikaire said that swift action was required to send the right message to the kidnappers and salvage the image of the country.</p>
      <p>“It is worrisome that no word has been heard from the abductors yet.</p>
      <p>“This is the more reason why the Federal government and its concerned agencies should intervene to salvage the image of Nigeria,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another lawyer, Blessing Iweajunwa, noted that the boycott of court proceedings by Imo chapter of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) since Monday was a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>According to her, the move will enable relevant agencies of government to come to terms with the reality of Mrs Nwosu-Iheme’s abduction and its underlying consequences.</p>
      <p>“Boycotting court proceedings for the sake of a Judge of the Federal Court of Appeal and former Judge of Imo High Court is a step in the right direction, it will send a message.</p>
      <p>“The consequences of this abduction are gruel not just for the judiciary but more so for Nigeria, “ she said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the NBA in Imo boycotted court sittings in the state since Monday in protest for the kidnap of Mrs Nwosu-Iheme.</p>
      <p>The Appeal Court judge, who hails from Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo State, <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/360280-police-orderly-killed-as-gunmen-kidnap-appeal-court-judge.html">was kidnapped last Wednesday on the Benin-Agbor expressway</a> while her orderly lost his life in the process.</p>
