      <p>“This is one cause because I feel so strongly about it… this is something I want to talk about… it was amazing to see despite the violence or the conflicts they faced, they’re resilient people… they have defied all odds and they’re hopeful,” she’s heard saying in the video shared along with the UN statement. “They actually are hopeful… and from now on all we have to do is not give up.”</p>
      <p>The celebrity said the cause was not limited to one country, and there “should be some responsibility sharing”.</p>
      <p>The UNHCR is a global organisation dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people.</p>
