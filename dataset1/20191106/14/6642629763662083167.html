      <p>Cleaners, porters and security officers at a leading British university are to strike in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and other issues.</p>
      <p>Members of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) at University College London (UCL) will walk out on November 19.</p>
      <p>The union said it will be the biggest strike of outsourced workers in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> higher education history.</p>
      <p>The IWGB balloted almost 300 workers over their terms and conditions, as part of the union's campaign to end outsourcing and zero-hours contracts at UCL.</p>
      <p>Virtually all the cleaners, porters and security officers who voted in a ballot backed strike action.</p>
      <p>UCL cleaner Maritza Castillo Calle said: "Outsourcing forces us to work sick and injured, to work all our lives and still retire in poverty."</p>
