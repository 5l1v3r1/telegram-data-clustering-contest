      <p>Revolut’s chief information security officer (CISO) Dinis Cruz has quit less than two months after he joined the firm.</p>
      <p>Cruz announced last week that he will leave the challenger bank this month, in a move described as being “by mutual agreement”.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He said he was “back in the market looking for my next challenge”. </p>
      <p>If comes after his predecessor, Paul Heffernan, left the company in September after just one year in the role.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the London-based fintech confirmed Cruz will leave later in the month.</p>
      <p>“We are currently in the process of recruiting for the position,” they added.</p>
      <p>The fintech faced reports of low employee retention in February, with 80 per cent of 147 former employees having been at the firm for less than a year, according to a poll by Wired magazine.</p>
      <p>Ex-banker Nikolay Storonsky, who formed Revolut in 2015 alongside co-founder app developer Vlad Yatsenko, admitted in March that the firm “hasn’t always gotten things right,” after fresh allegations of a toxic culture at the company.</p>
      <p>In response to claims of unpaid work, unachievable targets and high-staff turnover at the firm, he said: “We are not the same company that we were 12 to 18 months ago when these mistakes were made.”</p>
