《上一堂EMBA戲劇課》：練習用「五句話五個動作介紹自己」，逼出自己的創意
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是每個人都應該經常練習「5句話5個動作介紹自己」。透過這樣的訓練，發掘身上更多與眾不同的特色，讓你的角色更寬廣，讓別人迅速認識你。

與他人連結又有效益的自我介紹
我們劇團在甄選演員時，都會要求應徵者利用短短的一分鐘介紹自己。同樣地，在各種求職或申請入學的面試場合中，主考官通常也會要求應徵者在短短幾分鐘內自我介紹。
姑且不論中年人，即使是剛出社會的年輕人，也經歷了二十多年的歲月。如此「漫長」的一生，怎麼有辦法在幾分鐘甚至一分鐘內說清楚呢？
這就是考驗創意的時刻，要求你在「被限制的範圍內」呈現最精彩的演出。
現代人時間寶貴，沒有多少人有時間聽你慢慢拆解王大媽的裹腳布、又臭又長地回憶你的人生。每個人都必須發揮創意，在最短的時間內讓人留下最深刻的印象。
因此，我們會在戲劇課堂上要求學生做一項功課：使用簡短五句話，每一句話搭配一個動作，介紹你自己。
第一次幫某個單位進行教育訓練時，我們就要求受訓人員做這項功課。訓練後沒幾天，那個單位的主管告訴我們，這項訓練實在太有用了。他是保險業務人員，只用了簡單5句話就立刻讓客戶印象深刻，同時解答客戶想知道的事情，客戶很快就買單了。
假如有人要你設計出一種比名片夾更輕薄短小的外殼，裡頭卻要塞入更多東西，你會想到什麼？雖然外型被局限了，內容卻沒有被限制，創意就會因此到處紛飛，產生無限的可能性。比名片夾還小的外型卻塞入永遠聽不完的歌曲，iPod就是這樣誕生的！這是iPod最好的自我介紹。
同樣地，這就是「五句話五個動作介紹自己」的用意，試著逼出你的創意。
不論時間長短，自我介紹都要提到真正的關鍵，甚至必須事先瞭解對方最在意的是什麼。假如你要甄選劇團演員，卻一直強調自己喜歡游泳、享受美食，絕對無法讓人眼睛為之一亮，因為這跟舞台表演沒什麼關聯性。然而，假如你告訴我們，你很會跳舞，也會說相聲繞口令，甚至會縫製衣服製作道具，我們絕對立刻錄取，因為每一項都是舞台表演的關鍵技能！
領導者更是需要培養這種技能，在最短的時間內讓舞台燈光聚焦在自己身上，在茫茫人海中脫穎而出。每個人都會立刻認識你，你的專業形象會瞬間刻劃在他們的心版上。
演員在劇場舞台出場亮相時，同樣必須自我介紹，一出場就要讓觀眾知道你是誰，扮演什麼角色。例如，某個演員一上台就用訓斥的口吻對著另一個人說：「幹嘛，為什麼還在吃東西，什麼時候交報告？」台下觀眾一聽，就知道這個人應該是老闆。你不需要告訴大家你是老闆，只要簡單幾句話幾個動作，觀眾就知道你是誰，這樣才有創意；只有沒創意的人，才需要愚蠢地貼個標籤告訴觀眾他是誰。
同樣地，哈姆雷特出場時，不需告訴觀眾他是王子，他一鞠躬、說幾句話，擺出王子應有的肢體語言，所有人就知道他是王子了。
不論是否參與戲劇演出，每個人都應該經常練習「五句話五個動作介紹自己」。透過這樣的訓練，發掘身上更多與眾不同的特色，讓你的角色更寬廣，讓別人迅速認識你。當別人清楚你的特色與專長、需要你幫忙的時候，就會立刻想到你，這不是最好的行銷方式嗎？
情緒、符號與記憶
聽了別人的故事，取個響亮的綽號，透過照鏡子觀察夥伴，用簡單5句話讓別人留下深刻的印象。此時團隊漸漸成形，到了更進一步熟悉團隊夥伴、建構團隊履歷的時候了。
建構團隊履歷的過程中，我們會進行「快樂地與不快樂地」這樣的活動。首先，我們請每個人想想生命中最快樂或最不快樂的事情，然後請他們用報紙摺出一種東西，象徵這件快樂或不快樂的事情，例如房子或棒球手套。接下來，幾個人圍成一個小組，手上拿著報紙摺出的東西，輪流將快樂或不快樂的事情分享給其他人聽。最後再根據每個人摺出來的東西，共同討論這個小組的共通點，創造屬於這個團隊的履歷。
在團隊中，我們必須展現自己的過往，讓別人瞭解我們。當你聆聽別人的小故事時，彼此就會產生連結，也會更深入認識彼此，這樣的熟悉度會塑造出更緊密的團隊情感。
為什麼要用報紙摺出關於快樂或不快樂的東西呢？說故事的時候，若是佐以符號象徵，更容易讓別人體會到內心深處的情感；就像每個人看到十字架都會聯想到耶穌受難與基督信仰，這就是一種符號象徵。每一種符號象徵都可能讓人聯想到生命中的某件事情，對於同樣的符號，每個人的情感和聯想卻都不一樣。同樣是棒球手套，有人聯想到小時候跟父親一起打棒球的愉快記憶，有人反而會連結到遺失心愛手套的悲傷記憶。
美國劇作家田納西．威廉斯（Tennessee Williams）寫過一部極為有名的作品《玻璃動物園》（The Glass Menagerie），他就運用了一隻獨角獸做為劇中的象徵性道具。優秀的戲劇作品都會運用一些象徵性符號來強化故事內涵，我們同時也希望每個人都能找到自己生命中的象徵物品；如此一來，建構自己的生命故事時，更能看到歲月中的成長意義。
此外，每個人摺出來的東西也能組合成團隊的符號象徵，背後代表著團隊成員的共通點。這就像每一家公司的品牌符號，若非述說著這家公司的創業歷史，就是象徵著這家公司的企業文化。
這種活動運用在表演訓練時，就是所謂的「情緒記憶」。例如有人很喜歡小熊維尼，因為小時候擁有一整套小熊維尼故事書，令他愛不釋手。但是後來搬家時，一整套故事書竟然被媽媽丟了；對他而言，這實在是巨大的傷痛，一想起這件事就會鼻酸，眼眶泛紅。
因此，當他必須在舞台上表演難過的情緒時，可以聯想到整套小熊維尼故事書被丟掉的悲傷記憶，然後將這樣的記憶連結到目前的心境上，就很容易演出逼真的難過情緒。
身為專業演員，必須廣泛收集並且善用這種情緒記憶。擁有越多情緒記憶，越能幫助演員在舞台上呈現真實的情緒，台下觀眾因而感同身受，進而擴張故事的渲染力。

""The Last EMBA Drama Lesson"": Practice using ""five sentences and five actions to introduce yourself"" to force your own creativity
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that everyone should practice ""5 words and 5 actions to introduce themselves"". Through this kind of training, discover more distinctive features, make your role wider, and let others know you quickly.



Text: Liu Changwei, Lang Zuming
Self-introduction with links to others
When we select actors, our troupe will ask candidates to introduce themselves in just one minute. Similarly, in a variety of job interviews or application for admission, the examiner usually asks the applicant to introduce himself in just a few minutes.
Regardless of middle-aged people, even young people who have just left the society have experienced more than 20 years. How can there be a way to make it clear in a few minutes or even a minute in such a ""long"" life?
This is the moment to test your creativity and ask you to present the most exciting performances in the “limited range”.
Modern people have precious time. Not many people have time to listen to you slowly dismantling Wang Aunt's foot cloth, and stinking and remembering your life. Everyone must be creative and make the most impressive impression in the shortest possible time.
Therefore, we will ask students to do a homework in the drama class: use a short five sentences, each sentence with an action, introduce yourself.
When we first educated a unit for training, we asked the trainees to do this homework. A few days after the training, the director of the unit told us that the training was so useful. He is an insurance business person, and he immediately impressed the customer with a simple 5 sentences. At the same time, he answered the questions the customer wanted to know, and the customer quickly paid for it.
If someone wants you to design a shell that is lighter and thinner than a business card holder, but you have to stuff more in it, what do you think of? Although the appearance is limited, the content is not restricted, and the creativity will be scattered everywhere, creating unlimited possibilities. The smaller than the business card holder is inserted into the song that can never be heard, the iPod is born like this! This is the best self-introduction of the iPod.
In the same way, this is the intention of ""five words and five actions to introduce yourself"", try to force your creativity.
Regardless of the length of time, self-introduction must mention the real key, and even must know in advance what the other party is most concerned about. If you want to select a troupe actor, but always emphasize that you like to swim and enjoy food, you can't make your eyes shine, because it has nothing to do with the stage performance. However, if you tell us that you will dance very much, you will also say that you will be able to sew clothes and make props. We will definitely burn them, because each one is a key skill in the stage performance!
Leaders need to develop this skill, focus the stage lights on themselves in the shortest possible time, and stand out in the crowd. Everyone will know you immediately, and your professional image will be instantly engraved on their hearts.
When the actors appear on the stage of the theater, they must also introduce themselves. When they appear, they must let the audience know who you are and what role they play. For example, when an actor came to power, he said to another person in a rebellious tone: ""Why, why are you still eating and when to report?"" When the audience heard it, they knew that this person should be the boss. You don't need to tell everyone that you are the boss. With a few simple words and actions, the audience knows who you are, so that you can be creative. Only those who are not creative need to be stupidly labeled to tell the audience who he is.
Similarly, when Hamlet appeared, he did not need to tell the audience that he was a prince. He sighed and said a few words and put out the body language that the prince should have. Everyone knew that he was a prince.
Regardless of whether or not you participate in a theatrical performance, everyone should always practice ""five words and five actions to introduce themselves."" Through this kind of training, discover more distinctive features, make your role wider, and let others know you quickly. When others know your characteristics and expertise and need your help, they will immediately think of you. Isn't this the best marketing method?
Emotions, symbols and memories
Listen to other people's stories, take a loud nickname, observe the partners in the mirror, and let others impress them with simple 5 sentences. At this point, the team gradually formed, and it was time to become more familiar with the team partners and build the team resume.
In the process of constructing a team resume, we will carry out activities such as ""happy and unhappy."" First, we ask everyone to think about the happiest or most unhappy things in life, and then ask them to use the newspaper to fold something that symbolizes this happy or unhappy thing, such as a house or baseball glove. Next, several people gathered in a group, holding the things folded in the newspapers, and sharing the happy or unhappy things to others in turn. Finally, based on what everyone has folded, discuss the commonalities of the group and create a resume that belongs to the team.
In the team, we must show our past and let others know about us. When you listen to other people's stories, they will create links and deeper understanding of each other. This familiarity will create a closer team emotion.
Why do you want to use newspapers to fold things about happiness or unhappiness? When telling a story, if it is symbolized by symbols, it is easier for others to experience the emotions deep inside; just as everyone sees the cross, it will associate with the crucifixion of Jesus and the Christian faith. This is a symbolic symbol. Each symbolic symbol can be reminiscent of something in life. For the same symbol, each person's emotions and associations are different. The same is a baseball glove. Some people think of the happy memories of playing baseball with their father when they were young. Some people will connect to the sad memory of lost love gloves.
American playwright Tennessee. Tennessee Williams wrote a very famous work, The Glass Menagerie, who used a unicorn as a symbolic prop in the play. Excellent theatrical works will use some symbolic symbols to strengthen the connotation of the story. We also hope that everyone can find the symbolic objects in their lives. In this way, when building their own life stories, they can see the growth in the years. significance.
In addition, the things that each person folds can be combined into a symbolic symbol of the team, and the back represents the common point of the team members. This is like the brand symbol of each company. If you talk about the company's entrepreneurial history, it symbolizes the company's corporate culture.
This kind of activity is used in performance training, which is called ""emotional memory."" For example, some people like Winnie the Pooh, because he had a set of Winnie the Pooh storybooks when he was a child, so he couldn't put it down. But when I moved, a whole set of storybooks was lost by my mother. For him, this is really a huge pain. When I think about it, it will be sore and my eyes will be red.
Therefore, when he has to perform sad emotions on the stage, he can think of the sad memories of the whole set of Winnie the Pooh storybooks, and then connect such memories to the current state of mind, it is easy to perform realistic and sad emotions.
As a professional actor, this emotional memory must be widely collected and used. The more emotional memories there are, the more they can help the actors to present real emotions on the stage, and the audience will feel empathy, thus expanding the rendering power of the story.
