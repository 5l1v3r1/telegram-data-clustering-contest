（中央社記者張榮祥台南6日電）明天是台南市東區復興國中45週年校慶，正在韓國演藝圈發展的校友周子瑜首次錄製影片，祝福母校生日快樂；校方將影片後製傳到網路，且預定明年頒發「復興巨星」獎項給周子瑜。
台南市政府觀光旅遊局長陳信安今天在臉書分享了復興國中校慶祝福影片，片中赫然出現周子瑜的身影，頓時引起廣大的關注，這部影片觀看次數已逾3萬次。
周子瑜在影片中祝福母校45週年校慶活動順利圓滿成功，校長、老師、同學身體健康快樂。
復興國中校長敬世龍告訴中央社記者，周子瑜的影片是母親黃燕玲11月1日以電子檔傳送過來的，校方將影片後製，再上傳YouTube、臉書及學校官網。
敬世龍表示，校方正規劃邀請周子瑜明年校慶時回母校，校方也將首設「復興巨星」的獎項給周子瑜。
周子瑜持續關注母校復興國中，其實，在錄製影片前，周子瑜10月已在復興國中官網發表文章，祝福復興國中生日快樂。
周子瑜在文章中說「我未滿14歲就隻身一人去韓國，剛到韓國的時候要強逼自己短時間內把韓語學會，白天要到華僑學校唸書，下課後又要練習到很晚，每天一沾到枕頭就睡著了。雖然這麼累，但還是憑著對舞蹈的興趣和熱情，還是撐過來了。只是每當夜深人靜，總是想起故鄉台南也憶起在母校與師長同學相處的點點滴滴」。
周子瑜同時勉勵學弟妹說，不管興趣是什麼，堅持就對了，學習的過程中更要虛心接受任何批評與指導，不要輕言放棄，只要能保持正確的態度，成功就在不遠處。
周子瑜更感謝老師、團員、公司、家人及身旁許多貴人；她表示，沒有他們的幫助，她不會走到這裡，讓她能儲備許多能量，面對許多挑戰。（編輯：謝雅竹）1081106

(Central News Agency reporter Zhang Rongxiang, Tainan, 6th) Tomorrow is the 45th anniversary of the rejuvenation of the Eastern District of Tainan City. Alumni Zhou Ziyu, who is developing in the Korean entertainment industry, recorded the film for the first time, wishing the alma mater a happy birthday. The school will pass the film to the Internet and book it next year. Awarded the ""Revival Superstar"" award to Zhou Ziyu.
Chen Xinan, director of the Tourism and Tourism Bureau of the Tainan Municipal Government, shared the film of Fuxing’s Lieutenant Colonel’s celebration of Fu in the face of the book. Zhou Ziyu’s figure appeared in the film, which caused a lot of attention. The number of views of this film has exceeded 30,000.
In the film, Zhou Ziyu blessed the 45th anniversary of his alma mater, and the principal, teacher and classmates were healthy and happy.
Jing Shilong, the president of Fuxing Guozhong, told the Central News Agency that Zhou Ziyu’s film was sent by her mother Huang Yanling on November 1st. The school will post the film and upload it to YouTube, Facebook and the school’s official website.
Jing Shilong said that the school is planning to invite Zhou Ziyu to return to his alma mater during the school celebration next year. The school will also give the first prize of ""Rejuvenation Superstar"" to Zhou Ziyu.
Zhou Ziyu continued to pay attention to the alma mater's revival of the country. In fact, before the film was recorded, Zhou Ziyu published an article on the official website of the Fuxing State in October, wishing the birthday of the rejuvenation of the country.
Zhou Ziyu said in the article, ""I am only going to South Korea when I am under 14 years old. When I first arrived in Korea, I had to force myself to learn Korean in a short time. I had to go to an overseas Chinese school to study during the day. After class, I had to practice very late. I fell asleep as soon as I got to the pillow. Although I was so tired, I still supported it with my interest and enthusiasm for dancing. It was only when the night was quiet, I always remembered that my hometown Tainan also remembered the point where my alma mater and the teacher’s classmates lived together. Bit by bit.""
Zhou Ziyu also encouraged the younger brothers and sisters to say that regardless of the interest, the insistence is right. In the process of learning, we must accept any criticism and guidance with humility. Don't give up easily. As long as we can maintain a correct attitude, success is not far away.
Zhou Ziyu is more grateful to the teachers, members, the company, the family and many noble people around her; she said that without their help, she will not come here, so that she can reserve a lot of energy and face many challenges. (Editor: Xie Yazhu) 1081106
