      <p>YouTube naturally wants to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-new-monetization-options-rebuild-bridge-content-creators/">keep its creators from</a> opting for third-party membership providers like Patreon as <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/tech/youtube-creators-making-money/index.html">ad revenue on the video site continues to fall</a>. Paid features like <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/12/youtube-super-chat-allows-users-pay-get-exposure-live-comment-streams/">Super Chat</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/12/youtube-patreon-membership-tiers-paid-stickers-live-chats/">Super Stickers</a> helped ease the situation by forging another stream of revenue for content creators. The two monetization options will now be available to video makers from 9 additional countries.</p>
      <p>Here are the 9 markets that have just joined the list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Croatia</li>
        <li>Estonia</li>
        <li>Iceland</li>
        <li>Latvia</li>
        <li>Liechtenstein</li>
        <li>Lithuania</li>
        <li>Serbia</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
        <li>Turkey</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Counting these entrants, the number of countries <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/12/youtube-super-chats-can-now-be-purchased-in-19-more-countries/">where Super Chat and Super Stickers work</a> has now grown to 79. Viewers in any of these markets can now go ahead and support their favorite creator with a pinned comment or a $5 animated sticker during live streams. YouTube also offers a <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/17/youtube-premium-users-getting-2-in-free-super-chat-credit/">$2 Super Chat credit</a> to its Premium subscribers, which can be used to fund a channel. Having said that, content creators <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9277801">must meet a set of requirements</a> to become eligible for these revenue options.</p>
