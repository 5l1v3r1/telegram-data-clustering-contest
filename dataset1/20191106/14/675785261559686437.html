      <h1>Man, 44, who's battled cancer six times 'sticks two fingers up at his disease'</h1>
      <h2>Jonathan Acott has spent a third of his life fighting cancer and is now taking on an unbelievable challenge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:51:27+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Jonathan Acott has been fighting cancer for a third of his life after being diagnosed with the disease six times by the age of 44.</p>
      <p>He has had tumours in his chest, lungs, kidney and bowel.</p>
      <p>But now Jonathan, from Epsom in Surrey, is sticking two fingers up at the disease that robbed him of his 30s.</p>
      <p>He lives by the motto made famous by the hit film The Shawshank Redemption "you get busy living or you get busy dying".</p>
      <p>Jonathan is embarking on a challenge that will see him try to join the '7 Continents Club', which is an elite group of around 200 athletes who have completed a marathon on all continents in the world.</p>

      <p>Jonathan, a motivational speaker, life coach and ambassador for leading blackcurrant health and fitness supplement brand CurraNZ, says: “Life can't stop.</p>
      <p>"And my motivation for running these races almost comes from a point of defiance.</p>
      <p>"I know I've had cancer six times. I know it'll probably limit the length of my life. But I own that now, rather than railing against it, because I can't change it.</p>
      <p>“All I know is that if I exercise, I'm in a better mental space. My body and my mind are better prepared to deal with cancer should I get ill again."</p>
      <p>In spite of his ordeal Jonathan - who is currently cancer free - feels he is one of the lucky ones.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The former racecourse director said: “There are millions of other people who are surviving cancer but they can't get out there and exercise the way they want to. I can.</p>
      <p>“For me it would seem rather spoilt behaviour to be given the ability - both mentally and physically - to do these things and to instead sit on my backside and wallow when there are millions of people worse off.</p>
      <p>“I use supplements, particularly CurraNZ, so that I hurt less from training and it also helps my immune system.</p>
      <p>“You just have to go out there and live your best life.”</p>
      <p>Jonathan was just 29 in 2004 when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. </p>

      <p>The tumour eventually spread to his lymph nodes and lungs.</p>
      <p>But following 12 weeks of chemotherapy at hospital in Oxford, the cancer responded well to treatment.</p>
      <p>For three years Jonathan got back to living his life, only to suffer a relapse in 2007 after a rhabdomyosarcoma tumour the "size of a cricket ball" was discovered in his chest.</p>
      <p>He had full lateral thoracotomy to remove the mass - and was back swimming and going to the gym as soon as his wounds had healed.</p>
      <p>Back on his feet, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in February 2009, and a year later cycled the 874 miles from John O Groats to Lands End.</p>

      <p>In 2012 Jonathan also completed his first Ironman - consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26-mile run - in Nice, France.</p>
      <p>But while seemingly at the peak of his fitness, the cancer returned in 2013, after a germ cell tumour was discovered in the lymph nodes behind his stomach.</p>
      <p>This cancer had first manifested in 2012 - meaning he’d had it while completing the gruelling Ironman.</p>
      <p>He once again underwent surgery to remove the tumour - and 45 other lymph nodes - to become cancer-free once more.</p>
      <p>And by the start of 2014 Jonathan had completed a 12-mile solo swim covering the length of Lake Windermere in Cumbria, followed by an ultra-marathon in March 2015 - a 44-mile run around Bristol.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In June 2016, however, Jonathan’s nemesis returned to haunt him once more with cancerous lymph nodes discovered next to his kidney.</p>
      <p>More surgery followed only for a tumour on his kidney to be detected in February 2017.</p>
      <p>Jonathan didn’t let the disease deter him completing the Weymouth Half Ironman in September 2017.</p>
      <p>By December 2017, however, bowel cancer - diagnosis number six - was also found in his colon.</p>
      <p>Despite having his kidney and spleen surgically removed in May 2018 after three months of chemotherapy, determined Jonathan remains resolute.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “I've had a cumulative total of six months of chemotherapy in hospital, four major surgeries and have to take antibiotics for life because I have a compromised immune system.</p>
      <p>“I have permanent nerve damage and hearing loss - amongst a host of other issues.</p>
      <p>“Only with the last cancer - the tumour on my kidney - was I in pain. All the others have been so small that I didn't even notice they were there.</p>
      <p>"But what happens is because your body is clearly fighting something you get more and more tired, both mentally and physically.</p>
      <p>“It's incredibly draining because your body is trying to deal with an invader. And it’s hard to describe chemotherapy tiredness.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“It's a tiredness sleep can't solve. The only thing that will resolve it is time, because your body has to repair on a deep, cellular level.</p>
      <p>"For my chemotherapy, I was in hospital for five days at a time and on a drip for 23 hours a day.</p>
      <p>“You get bad aching joints, shin pain, ankle pain, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, acid reflux like you've never experienced and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/how-get-rid-heartburn-reflux-12583171">heartburn</a> . Your body hates every single second.</p>
      <p>"There's listlessness, there's forgetfulness.</p>
      <p>“I used to be able to do a crossword in a well-known broadsheet in about 10 minutes. Now I can't do it, the brain just dies. It's all very very challenging."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There were times when Jonathan admits he was on a self-destruct mission and he considered taking his own life but seeing a psychotherapist helped him through it.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, he has already ticked off one of the marathons on his inter-continental to-do list.</p>
      <p>In September he ran the Berlin Marathon in a time of 4 hours and 58 minutes.</p>
      <p>And the next leg of his journey will take him to Africa for the Marrakech Marathon in Morocco in January next year.</p>
      <p>One thing Jonathan credits with helping him stay so active is his use of a blackcurrant supplement called CurraNZ.</p>
      <p>The blackcurrants used in the product are grown in New Zealand - and because of the Southern Hemisphere’s intense UV light, this produces unusually high levels of protective and health-giving nutrients compared with berries grown elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Jonathan said: “My health issues mean that I don’t recover as well as I used to after exercise and I am prone to infection, so I can’t let myself get run down.</p>
      <p>"As well as ensuring that I have a very carefully tailored training plan, I use CurraNZ for their muscle recovery, anti-inflammatory and immune system-boosting properties which means I'm always ready for the next session."</p>
      <p>“With the correct training, my CurraNZ and some luck I can show anyone who is suffering or having a tough time that anything is possible if you know your limitations not your limits.”</p>
