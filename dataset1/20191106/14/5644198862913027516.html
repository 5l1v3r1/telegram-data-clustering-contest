      <p>SYDNEY: Former cricket administrator Pat Howard was Wednesday (Nov 6) named as part of a three-man panel to review the Wallabies 2019 season which culminated in their World Cup flop.</p>
      <p>Australia, under Michael Cheika, crashed out of the tournament in Japan at the quarter-final stage to England, sparking stinging criticism of not only his tactics, but his Rugby Australia bosses by domestic media.</p>

      <p>Howard, an ex-Wallaby and team performance chief at Cricket Australia, will join four-time Olympic rower Bo Hanson and Australian Test centurion Nathan Sharpe in determining what went wrong.</p>
      <p>They will work alongside director of rugby Scott Johnson to deliver the review over the next month.</p>
      <p>"Having these three individuals leading the process will provide a well-rounded perspective on the Wallabies programme," Said Rugby Australia chief Raelene Castle.</p>
      <p>"It will enable us to take forward any key learnings for delivery into the major tournament preparations of all of our national teams over the next four-year cycle."</p>
      <p>All 2019 Wallabies squad members and team staff will be interviewed.</p>
      <p>It is a continuation of a review process conducted in 2018 that saw the introduction of a three-person Wallabies selection panel and closer working arrangements with Super Rugby clubs.</p>
      <p>The review will run separately to the process of appointing a new Wallabies coach after Cheika stepped down.</p>
      <p>Castle has previously said she hopes to make an announcement on the new coach before Christmas, with New Zealander Dave Rennie the favourite with bookmakers.</p>
