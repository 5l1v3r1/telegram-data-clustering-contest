        <b>A knifeman has injured four foreign tourists and four locals in an attack in the Jordanian city of Jerash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three Mexicans and a Swiss national were among the wounded. One of the Mexicans and a Jordanian tour guide were hurt seriously, the health minister said.</p>
      <p>The suspected attacker was arrested nearby by police.</p>
      <p>Jerash, home to a well-preserved ancient Roman site, draws thousands of foreign visitors every year.</p>
      <p>Videos on social media show one woman lying bleeding on the ground and another woman in a blood-stained shirt.</p>
      <p>Jordan's health minister, Saed Jaber, told reporters that all the injured were taken to a local hospital within 15 minutes. The Mexican tourist and Jordanian tour guide injured seriously were then taken to a separate hospital by helicopter and underwent surgery.</p>
      <p>"The bleeding was stopped, the situation has been controlled, and both cases are stable," Mr Jaber said.</p>
      <p>An American tourist, Marco Junipero Serra, told the BBC the person who had carried out the attack was dressed all in black and had his face covered with a mask.</p>
      <p>The attacker jumped a fence at the site at around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) and began stabbing people indiscriminately, Mr Serra said.</p>
      <p>According to him, police did not lock down the site during the incident, and people were still free to walk in and out.</p>
      <p>One of those injured was Ali El Agrabawi, the driver of a tourist bus. At Jerash hospital he told reporters he had been stabbed while trying to stop the assailant from entering a cafeteria full of tourists.</p>
      <p>Jordan, viewed as a relatively safe destination, heavily depends on its tourism industry.</p>
      <p>According to country's tourism board, the country is home to 21,000 archaeological and historical sites.</p>
