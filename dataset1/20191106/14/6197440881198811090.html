      <h1>Chrome OS 78 rolling out: Split browser/device settings, YouTube for Android PiP, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:39:25+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>After rolling out to Android, <a href="https://wp.me/p9SZ9T-1jdR">Mac, Windows, and Linux</a>, <a href="https://wp.me/p9SZ9T-1hif">version 78</a> of Chrome OS is now available. Notable features in Chrome OS 78 include separate browser and device settings, click-to-call, and the full launch of Virtual Desks.</p>
      <p>Chrome is getting another cross-device sharing feature after “<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/10/chrome-77-mac-windows-stable/">Send this page</a>” widely rolled in September. With “<b><a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/02/22/google-chrome-click-call-android/">click-to-call</a></b>,” you can right-click on phone number links — like tel:800-800-8000 —  to have them sent to your Android device. It’s quicker than manually entering those digits or transferring via email.</p>
      <p>Chrome OS 78 will <b>separate browser and device settings</b>. The former is accessible directly at chrome://settings and what opens when clicking “Settings” at the bottom of the Overflow menu in the top-right corner of any browser window. It opens as a tab and provides web-related preferences. Meanwhile, chrome://os-settings opens as its own window, and can be accessed from the quick settings sheet. It provides device options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Assistant in a white Material Theme UI with an icon in the launcher/app shelf.</p>

      <p>If <b>Virtual Desks</b> did not roll out with <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/27/chrome-os-77-stable/">version 77</a> last month, it should be widely available this release. Useful shortcuts include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new Desk with “Shift” + “Search ” + “=”</li>
        <li>Switch between Desks with “Search ” + “]”</li>
        <li>Move windows between Desks with “Shift” + “Search ” + “]”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>YouTube for Android now supports picture-in-picture</b> with Chrome OS 78. After starting a video in the mobile client, switching to another window, covering, or minimizing the app will automatically open a PiP in the bottom-right corner. Available controls include switching to audio, play/pause, and skipping to the next track. In the top-left, you can expand the window and a settings gear on the other side allows you to open system settings. Tapping in the center expands and returns you to the YouTube Android app.</p>

      <p>Chrome OS is not getting all the <b>customization options</b> <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/09/19/desktop-chrome-theming/">available on Mac, Windows, and Linux</a>. Google has made “Customize” — in the bottom-right corner of the New Tab page — open a new Material window. The New Tab “Background” option is unchanged from before, but “Shortcuts” lets you customize the icons that appear underneath the search field. There are three possibilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My shortcuts: Shortcuts are suggested based on websites you visit often</li>
        <li>Most visited sites: Shortcuts are curated by you</li>
        <li>Hide shortcuts: Don’t show shortcuts on this page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Color and theme” — which lets you choose between twenty preset themes, or launch a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/02/google-chrome-create-custom-theme/">color picker</a> to create your own — is now available on Chrome OS.</p>

      <p>Chrome OS 78 is simplifying the <b>printing</b> experience by automatically listing compatible printers without any prior setup required. Google has also reduced the number of steps needed to save frequently used printers to your profile.</p>

      <p>There are a number of <b>Linux on Chrome OS enhancements</b> in this version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Backups of Linux apps and files can now be saved to local storage, external drive, or Google Drive. That copy can be then restored when setting up a new computer.</li>
        <li>Crostini GPU support will be enabled by default for a “crisp, lower-latency experience.”</li>
        <li>You’ll be warned when using a Linux app that does not support virtual keyboard in tablet mode.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chrome is <b><i>cleaning up</i> chrome://flags</b> starting with version 78. The stated reason for enterprise customers is how policies are a better way to configure the browser. “Many flags” will be removed going forward, but this should not significantly impact consumers.</p>
      <p>Other changes in version 78 include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pressing and holding a Chromebook’s power button reveals a new “Feedback” shortcut alongside the Power off, Sign out and Lock menu.</li>
        <li>A tweak to the Files app moves the progress center from the lower left-hand corner to the main window.</li>
        <li>The ChromeVox screen reader can now announce text styling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chrome OS 78 is rolling out now and will be available for all Chromebooks over the next several weeks.</p>
