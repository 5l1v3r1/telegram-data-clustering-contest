“We have also made adequate provisions to move Kaduna State University from the current site to its permanent site along Zaria road.

Also, the Executives Secretary of the state Scholarship Board, Hassan Rilwan, asked for the assembly’s intervention for upward review on some critical aspects of the scholarship awarded to students.
Mr Rilwan said it is important to ensure that students, especially those studying abroad, are adequately catered for.
He said the board would roll out minimum criteria for government sponsorship, which would be strictly awarded based on merit.
Mr Rilwan added the board would make special provisions for students with disabilities and those studying courses which the state has special needs.
The Chairman, House Committee on Education, Yusuf Liman, assured that the lawmakers would fully support important government policies targeted at moving the state forward.
