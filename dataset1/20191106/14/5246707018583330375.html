      <hr/>
      <p>To make sure your copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is up to date, simply load up the game. As long as your console is connected to the internet, the new download should begin immediately. Of course, Terry isn't included as part of the free Version 6.0 update, but rather as a DLC pack which has been released at the same time. The DLC pack can be purchased from the Nintendo eShop.</p>
