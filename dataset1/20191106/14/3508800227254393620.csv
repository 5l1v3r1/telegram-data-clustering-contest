《哲學家陪你看電影》：從《V怪客》談媒體與德希達的「宗教式回歸」
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是電影中，V怪客揭露的就是政府要遮蔽的，而政府所揭露的一切其實正是要遮蔽那些無法公開的。因此這便是德希達要告訴我們的，科技和媒體暗地裡（卻是明確和清晰地）還是與宗教－政府勾結在一起，這種裙帶的資本主義關係使得國族主義更加擴大，而不是使人更開放的接觸到國際。



文：蔡士瑋、梁家瑜
《V怪客》（V for Vendetta）

《尤其不要記者！》在擺脫了媒體干擾後所做的決定，還會是一樣的嗎？


類型：劇情片
導演：詹姆斯．麥克特格（James McTeigue） 華卓斯基（The Wachowski Brothers）
上映：2005年
主演：娜塔莉．波曼（Natalie Portman）、雨果．威明（Hugo Weaving）、約翰．赫特（John Hurt）、史蒂芬．雷（Stephen Rea），以及史帝芬．福萊（Stephen Fry）
預算：五千四百萬美元
票房：一億三千兩百二十五萬美元

鏡頭與場景
這三個鏡頭裡各自有一個螢幕，螢幕裡是一個戴著面具的人的一場演講。這場演講的內容和演講者所戴的面具，都和這場演講的主旨一樣，走出了螢幕，讓螢幕外的更多人戴上了面具。自從這部片《V怪客》在年上映後，許多國家乃至跨國的社會運動都有人選擇在抗議時戴上這個面具——一個主動違反「禁蒙面法」（Anti-Masking Laws，原本主要是為了懲罰進行犯罪行為時的蒙面行為，但包含美國與加拿大在內的國家， 都將這個法令適用於在抗議中戴V怪客面具〔Guy Fawkes Mask〕）的做法。而這都開始於這場演講戲，電影中第一次這個面具出現在國人面前的時刻。
這場戲有兩個主題：大家看電視裡的V怪客（雨果．威明飾），以及警方搜捕的V怪客。至於為何要搜捕V，以及大家為何可透過電視看到V，是因為V的演講是錄好燒在光碟上的影音檔，而直播是V闖入英國國家電視台，挾持一整層工作人員，脅迫播映室技師插播給全國人民。因此，警察要闖入播映室把V揪出來，但當然沒有成功。
整場戲最重要的內容就是V成功播放的演講。演講就是為了煽動，因此我們最常看到演講場面的，就是戰爭片——主角召喚麾下戰士起身奮戰。然而，在這部片裡面，這場演講的呈現方式比大部分電影更複雜。原因可分為兩方面：演講的聽眾，與傳播演講的媒體。在戰爭片中，聽眾（幾乎）全都是演講者要召喚的戰士，但在《V怪客》裡面，這場演講其實除了對召喚對象喊話（明年11月5日，大家一起來炸掉國會），他其實也是在對他的復仇對象發出聲明。
我們該如何理解V的喊話，以及意識到喊話對象的不同呢？
我們從這場戲中選出三個鏡頭，都是只有一個聽眾面對演講者的過肩鏡頭（over the shoulder shot，廣泛用於表示角色的互動，或是角色在注視某物的時候），它們清楚顯示出過肩鏡頭作為第三人稱鏡頭（third-person shot）的意義。在這三個鏡頭中，鏡頭——我們（觀眾）都位於畫面裡的人物（演講聽眾）的背後，和人物一起面對演講者。第一個鏡頭的人物是電視喜劇主持人戈登（史帝芬．福萊飾），第二個鏡頭是整部片都在追捕V、但卻又似乎最理解V的警探芬奇（史帝芬．雷飾），這兩個鏡頭中的人物都是V的召喚對象。
和第三個鏡頭相比，我們可以發現螢幕距離角色相較遠，因此螢幕中的V也較不具有壓迫性。相反地，在第三個鏡頭裡，我們可以看到V和畫面中的人物簡直像是近距離面對面一樣。同時，V的演講到第三個鏡頭時講到的正是：「如果你要找罪人，你只要看看鏡子就好了。」也就是關於國家的一切壓迫與罪惡。而第三個鏡頭，正好讓鏡頭中的人物（情報頭子）和V顯得像是鏡中對影。這個鏡頭在暗示我們，第一，這兩個人是終極死對頭，再者，兩人在彼此眼中就是犯人，最後，因為演講的人是V，所以情報頭子就是他說的那個罪人。
如果這三個鏡頭可以說明V的演講同時針對兩種不同的對象，那接下來的問題是：演講透過螢幕播放、觀眾看的演講在螢幕中，具有什麼意義？

故事
整個《V怪客》的故事由四條主線交織而成：

私人復仇：V怪客在今年11月5日凌晨深夜炸掉司法大樓樓頂，接著在一系列仇殺過後，在第二年11月5日完成最後兩起仇殺，並安排好炸掉國會大廈的過程。
兩人愛情：在第一天炸掉司法大廈頂樓時，認識了女主角艾薇（娜塔莉．波曼飾），兩人在這一年的各種經歷中發展出來的愛情故事。
公眾反抗：V怪客在今年11月5日凌晨半夜炸掉司法大樓大廈後，當天下午闖進國家電視台播放演講，呼籲國人在第二年同一日前來國會大廈，引發當局追捕，並導致當局在一年內激發民憤、讓人民依約前來見證立法大廈爆炸。
公共歷史：V怪客呼籲人民起義與他的系列仇殺，都是針對當局掌權過程以及掌權後的不義行為，而V怪客本人正是當局掌權下的第一批受害者。

在這四個層面中，V透過國家電視台插播演講，是不可或缺的環節。這是整部片裡面他唯一一次出現在眾人面前，而且是出現在電視機裡面。沒有這次現身，也就沒有電影最後所有人的出場，並肩走向成隊持槍的軍事部隊。且依約前來的人個個都戴著V怪客面具。作為成千上萬個V來到V要炸掉的國會。
因此，我們可以說，這部片的故事，是一個人登高一呼，眾人響應的故事，這是所有戰爭片演講的基本原則。但這部片同時也是一個人透過媒體傳播，讓電視外的觀眾在現實中響應的故事。更重要的是，觀眾響應的方式，是在現實中化身成為原本在電視中被看見的演講者。換言之，這裡有一個轉換：從電子訊號轉換成血肉之軀，從螢幕中轉換到起義現場，從一人轉換成眾人。如果無法完成這個轉換，V的復仇就無法徹底實現；只要眾人不願意戴上V怪客面具，到V怪客約定的現場，V的革命就無法成功。
而就在所有人戴上面具到國會外的那天，V在殺死最後兩個仇人，也就是政府首腦與情報頭子之後，自己也身負重傷，在艾薇懷裡死去。他將是否炸掉國會的決定交給艾薇，而在V死後，艾薇決定炸掉國會，所有到場的人都在國會爆炸時，脫掉面具，以自己的面目見證國會的倒塌。
主旨
一個被獨裁政權受害者計畫復仇，殺死所有的加害者，並呼喚與誘使全國人民起身反抗獨裁政權的故事。
如果戴面具上電視演講，以及聽電視裡的演講後，戴面具到場，是一種觀者對V的認同（我們都是V怪客），也是V的化身（一個V變成了無數的V），那電視螢幕到底具有什麼意義？我們是在自己的世界中按照自己的意志行動，還是我們在選擇要認同哪個傳遞給我們的訊息，並且去活出我們選擇的訊息？
哲學文獻選讀：德希達，《尤其不要記者！》，頁21-25。採用版本：Jacques Derrida, Surtout, pas de journalistes!, Galilée, 2016.
文獻說明
德希達《尤其不要記者！》是1997年在巴黎荷蘭學院舉行的「宗教與媒體」會議的發言稿。本書基本上分成兩個部分：發言的逐字稿（算第一部分）和參加者的提問及德希達的回應（第二部分）。
對2004年底就過世的德希達來說，1007年的發表已經算是晚期思想的成熟期了。而這時的發表作品大多跟歐洲整體政治－經濟－文化和國族等主題相關。在本書裡的內容就是基於主辦單位給的兩個主題做發揮，如書中開頭所說的：雙重性或是情緒矛盾（ambivalence）和父－子。德希達很快地就將《聖經．創世記》中上帝、亞伯拉罕和以撒的故事帶入，說明與這兩個主題之間的相關性。父－子關係的主題在上帝、亞伯拉罕和以撒之間已不需多解釋，比較需要說明的是雙重性或情緒矛盾的主題。
由於上帝在這裡要求亞伯拉罕將以撒祭的方式獻給祂，也就等於是要將送出的禮物收回，也同時將亞伯拉罕變回原來無子的狀態，這便是第一重的改變狀態，裡面同時蘊含著情緒矛盾的主題。尤其是對亞伯拉罕來說，這是與上帝之間不能被揭露的秘密，是代表著上帝對亞伯拉罕的考驗。當然，對信仰的考驗以秘密的形式出現就是第二重的狀況，同時也暗示著亞伯拉罕在情緒上的承擔，因為他被禁止告訴自己的妻子。那麼，對以撒來說就是第三重的狀態，亦即也呈現情緒矛盾，因為以撒在出發時和路上就已經感覺到事態異常，但是他作為兒子卻願意跟隨並相信父親，就算到他被綁起來準備被殺的當下，《聖經》裡並未告訴我們以撒的任何反抗，但是我們可以說齊克果的《恐懼與顫慄》已經將以撒這個狀態的雙重性表達了出來。那麼，這裡或許就是德希達要鋪陳主題聯繫和開展的狀態，接著他轉向當代生活中的媒體與信仰、宗教和科技之間的關係的轉變。
其實，這個轉變就是從耶穌基督的出現講起的。但是，德希達並非要直接談論耶穌基督的出現進而促使基督教建立之事，而是要從基督教信仰對美國的科技－經濟－資本主義結合這裡講起。因此，他才會一開始從上帝與亞伯拉罕之間的祕密出發，談在這個祕密關係裡面並不能有任何的「中介者」，就算是基督耶穌或是其他任何與「消息」／「福音」／「新的」（法文都是nouvelle）有關的中介存在也絕不容許。而本書標題的「記者」其實就是「傳福音」（bonne nouvelle）、傳播（好）消息或新聞（nouvelle）的當代社會代表。而作為這個代表的物體就是電視，也可以被翻譯為「遠端能見」（télé-vision），就是科技的表現和生活的轉變的中介。
從19世紀攝影發明一直到電視以來技術的發展迅速，人們的生活慢慢轉變不再通過親身體驗，就可以接受世界的所有訊息／消息，而且這個消息／訊息被認為是被真實地並直接地傳遞出來，也就是「好的消息」（福音）。電視大概是二十世紀後半、二戰之後開始普及化的遠端傳播工具，能夠超越時空的遠端科技產物。電視的發明不僅讓文化傳播快速起來，也讓宗教能夠世俗化，其中一個意義就是——人們不再有秘密。電視機的超越性意涵跟宗教中的超越性意義因此不謀而合，電視成為福音傳播的工具就是德希達要探討的問題：「電視－基督教－美國－資本主義社會－文化霸權」結合序列，即一種所謂的「宗教性的」或是「宗教式」的回歸現象，但是已經不一定帶有此宗教本身的內在習慣和傳統。
因此，在進入我們的文獻之前，德希達追問為何當今媒體（尤其以美國為主）都被基督教式的媒體所佔據，也就是媒體「全球化」和「世界化」，或者對他來說更應該稱為媒體「世界拉丁化」（mondialatinisation），也就是一種媒體「基督教－羅馬帝國－拉丁文」共生的世界霸權圖像傳統的延續問題。這就是他追問的第一個問題，而我們引用的是第二個。那麼，在第一個問題裡，他認為現今的媒體就是通過將基督宗教裡的儀式或是祭獻的方式將上帝變成可見的（一般稱為「肉身化」或「道成肉身」），讓人們可以在電視上面或是通過遠端技術的媒體而讓上帝可見化或實在化。如此一來，大家只要有任何一種遠端科技，也就像是耶穌傳福音一樣可以傳遞「上帝」至我們面前。也可以說，或許基督宗教在當代通過遠端技術和媒體進入到我們日常生活裡，即是宗教的世界化或是世俗化，也就是基督宗教的現代化或當代化。
文獻解析
德希達的第二個問題是關於「宗教式的回歸」和媒體之間的關係。
透過電視，或是任何我們現在相關的軟硬體科技設備作為中介而傳遞訊息。但是能夠傳遞出去就表示這個訊息或說這個事物一定需要轉換其實體，這便是精神性或幽靈性的肉身化概念。媒體就屬於這個精神的或是幽靈的傳播，因為肉身在場化必須透過像是電視或我們的手機等媒介才得以完成，肉體或是物質本身無法傳輸，傳輸的必定屬於精神性的事物。但是也因為有這樣的媒體機制（電視等），我們每個人都直接的與上帝活生生的接觸（直播或是現場連線等）。我們每一個人都像是亞伯拉罕一般，擁有這個公開的秘密。而當代遠端科技的發展就使得缺席的能夠在場，不在場的能夠在場，沒有肉身的能夠擁有肉身，這便是虛擬的肉身概念。
所以這個「宗教式的回歸」問題也是類似的，即指出不再擁有宗教的本質、卻擁有宗教的形式的回返，在此德希達就稱為幽靈化或是精神化的過程，而且這個過程總是聯繫到語言和民族國家（État-nation），對立於聯繫到國際。我們在這裡可以看到，媒體所帶來的遠端傳播效力並不是表面的世界化，而是要面向自己的國族和語言認同。這裡就像是電影中，不論是V怪客還是獨裁者都利用電視撥放自己的影像和話語，這個話語和影像都直接性地進入到每個人家裡，甚至到每個人的意識裡。媒體通過電視傳播的是要展現的自我內容，而不是開放的國際化視野。那麼基督宗教在這裡就是鞏固了美國媒體的形式，它傳送福音也傳送耶穌，同時也傳送國族話語。因此這是封閉的歷程，而非開放的或是國際的。
不過，德希達提到電視是自己反對自己的技術，因為電視就是「直播」（direct、live）的中介，讓我們藉由它而感覺真實在場，讓我們的覺知經由視覺而馬上能夠「身歷其境」。而數位化這些影像就是加速呈現基督教精神或是虛擬化、幽靈化。媒體或是遠端科技就是「希臘－羅馬－基督教」的霸權的再現型態，這個霸權至今同時是政治的、經濟的和宗教的。因此傳媒科技將信仰放在事物自身之前，人們就不再需要信仰了，只需要觀看（電視）就夠了。觀看就是信仰。
這個觀看就是「信仰的招喚」（appel à la foi），這個事物自身在我們眼前在場，於是這個媒介就是沒有媒介，這便是他們自我反對的方式。電視和遠端科技讓我們和這些遠處事物一起「活著」（live），如同奇蹟一般。但是通過宗教的世俗化和世界化，甚至是電視化或媒體化，宗教傳播已經在電視裡或是各種媒體科技裡面傳播了。電視因此取消自己，因為電視是直播的中介，這個概念就是自我矛盾的，直播怎麼會需要中介呢？同時，現在我們用手機可以點燈和參拜，用虛擬實境可以進到好幾公里外的神廟參觀等等。於是，我們經由傳媒和媒體改宗了，我們建立起更大的國族社群，通過共同語言和共同生活社群，我們開始信仰媒體這個新宗教，媒體將宗教赤裸的呈現給我們，沒有了秘密，我們可以輕易觸碰和觀看宗教或是任何我們想要的內容，一切更為透明也更為遮掩。
電影中，V怪客揭露的就是政府要遮蔽的，而政府所揭露的一切其實正是要遮蔽那些無法公開的。因此這便是德希達要告訴我們的，科技和媒體暗地裡（卻是明確和清晰地）還是與宗教－政府勾結在一起，這種裙帶的資本主義關係使得國族主義更加擴大，而不是使人更開放的接觸到國際。這也是為何V怪客最後放手把決定權交到女主角艾薇那裡，因為它象徵著不再為傳播的影像或是其他任何信仰或意識形態所干擾，而是人民自己的決定，是每一個人擺脫了任何媒介或中介所做的決定。而這樣的決定才是國際的和在場的，而不是幽靈化的。

看電影可沒你想像的這麼簡單九場經典電影，九個哲學思考

這是一個影像豐沛的年代。在這影像豐沛的年代，你的思考方式也被影像制約著；在影像的時代裡，更要警醒地考慮到影像的構成。
台灣近年來強調公民教育、希望培養學生有獨立思考的能力，其中也包括了哲學思考。要如何將哲學思考更貼近生活，不落入專技的範圍，卻又不失哲學特質的挑戰並不小。
而看電影即是生活中再普遍不過的日常行為。
電影不只是電影，它投射出一個影像運動的平面，糾集了不同時間流，就連公共生活或私人空間也被此類異樣的時空所穿透，有多到不行的層次可以挖掘，甚至在想像力中撐開極大的張力。
此書特殊之處在於，作者並不刻意將電影哲學化或是哲學電影化，而是把它清楚分為兩件單一的主題作討論。因此，各章節將以影片資訊、鏡頭畫面、鏡頭、場景、敘事或故事、主旨、問題的順序作呈現，讓讀者跟隨作者的敘述，小心翼翼地進入電影，穿破視覺直觀，再深入哲學。當了解哲學語言的運作，知道怎麼讀電影，也就會理解到影像「要說什麼，不說什麼、什麼留白」，這時，要插入哲學思考的發問，就會有合理性。反過來，有較為豐厚的哲學知識，更是有助於提煉出一些問題設定，借用影像運動來進行推理。

《楚門的世界》：我們為什麼會認為楚門離開被安排的人生後，就獲得真正的「快樂自由」了呢？
《關鍵報告》：有犯罪意圖的人，就可被構成罪犯嗎？
《刺激一九九五》：為何主角不惜被關禁閉，也要播放音樂呢？「希望」之於生活到底代表了什麼？

透過影像來思考，質問影像，找到之間微妙卻相輔相成的連結，用更平易近人的管道，以觸發更多思考的可能。影像固然不是真理，也未必揭露真相，但往往能夠形成一道帷幕操縱我們對真實世界的認知與感受。現在，讓我們一起來看場電影吧！

""Philosophers Watching Movies with You"": Talking about the ""Religious Return"" of the Media and Dehida from ""V Freak""
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that in the movie, the V geeks reveal that the government wants to cover up, and everything that the government exposes is actually to cover those that cannot be made public. So this is what Deschida wants to tell us. Technology and the media are secretly (but clearly and clearly) or colluded with the religion-government. This kind of nepotism’s capitalist relationship makes nationalism more broad, not People are more open to the international community.



Text: Cai Shizhen, Liang Jiayu
V geek (V for Vendetta)

""Don't especially be a reporter! Will the decision made after getting rid of media interference will be the same?


Type: Drama
Director: James. James McTeigue The Wachowski Brothers
Released: 2005
Starring: Natalie. Natalie Portman, Hugo. Hugo Weaving, John. John Hurt, Stephen. Stephen Rea, and Stephen. Stephen Fry
Budget: $54 million
Box office: $133.25 million

Lens and scene
Each of these three shots has a screen, and the screen is a speech by a masked person. The content of this speech and the mask worn by the speaker, like the main theme of this speech, came out of the screen and made more people outside the screen put on the mask. Since the film ""V geek"" was released in the year, many countries and even multinational social movements have chosen to wear this mask during the protest - an active violation of the ""Anti-Masking Laws"" (originally the main It is to punish the masked act of committing a crime, but countries including the United States and Canada apply this law to the Guy Fawkes Mask in protest. And this started in this speech, the first time the film appeared in front of the Chinese people.
There are two themes in this play: everyone watching the V geeks on TV (Hugo. Weiming) and the V geeks that the police searched. Why is it necessary to hunt V and why everyone can see V through TV? It is because V's speech is recorded on the CD-ROM, and the live broadcast is V into the British National Television, holding a whole layer of staff, coercion broadcast Room technicians interspersed to the people of the country. Therefore, the police had to break into the broadcast room to get V out, but of course it did not succeed.
The most important part of the whole play is the speech that V successfully played. The speech is to incite, so the most often we see the scene of the speech is the war film - the protagonist summons the underarms to get up and fight. However, in this film, this presentation is presented in a more complex way than most movies. The reasons can be divided into two aspects: the audience of the speech, and the media that spread the speech. In the war film, the audience (almost) are all the fighters to be summoned by the speaker, but in the ""V-Guest"", this speech actually calls for the caller (on November 5th next year, everyone will blow up the Congress) He is actually making a statement about his object of revenge.
How do we understand V's shouts and realize the difference in the object of the call?
We selected three shots from this scene, all of which are only one listener facing the speaker's over the shoulder shot (widely used to indicate the interaction of characters, or when the character is looking at something). Clearly shows the meaning of the shoulder lens as a third-person shot. In these three shots, the lens - we (the audience) are behind the characters in the picture (speaking audience), facing the speaker with the characters. The first shot of the character is the TV comedy host Gordon (Steffen Foley), the second shot is the whole film is chasing V, but seems to understand V the most detective Finch (Smith. Ray Decoration), the characters in these two shots are the call of V.
Compared with the third lens, we can find that the screen is far from the character, so the V in the screen is less oppressive. Conversely, in the third shot, we can see that the characters in V and the picture are almost like face-to-face. At the same time, V’s speech to the third shot is exactly what it says: “If you are looking for a sinner, you just have to look at the mirror.” That is all the oppression and sin about the country. The third shot, just like the characters in the lens (intelligence head) and V appear to be in the mirror. This shot is suggesting us, first, these two people are the ultimate rivals. Moreover, the two are prisoners in each other's eyes. Finally, because the speaker is V, the intelligence leader is the sinner he said.
If these three shots can show that V's speech is aimed at two different objects at the same time, then the next question is: What is the meaning of the speech through the screen and the audience's speech on the screen?

story
The story of the entire ""V geek"" is interwoven by four main lines:

Private revenge: V geeks blew up the roof of the Judicial Building late in the morning of November 5 this year, and then after the series of vendettas, completed the last two vendettas on November 5, the second year, and arranged to blow up the Capitol. process.
Love for two people: When I blew up the top floor of the Judicial Building on the first day, I met the heroine Ivy (Nataly Boman), the love story that the two developed in the various experiences of the year.
Public Rebellion: After smashing the Judicial Building in the middle of the morning on November 5 this year, V geeks broke into the National TV broadcast speech in the afternoon, calling on the Chinese to come to the Capitol on the same day of the second year, causing the authorities to hunt down and lead the authorities to Infuriate public anger within a year and let the people come to witness the explosion of the Legislative Building.
Public History: V geeks appeal to the people's uprisings and his series of vendettas, all aimed at the authorities' process of power and the injustices after taking power, and V geeks themselves are the first victims under the authority of the authorities.

Among these four levels, V is an indispensable part of the national TV station. This is the only time in the whole film that he appeared in front of everyone, and it appeared in the TV set. Without this appearance, there would be no final appearance of the film, and the military forces who were armed with guns. And everyone who comes to the appointment is wearing a V geek mask. As thousands of V come to Congress to blow up V.
Therefore, we can say that the story of this film is a story of a person who rises up and responds, which is the basic principle of all war films. But this film is also a story of a person who communicates through the media and allows viewers outside the TV to respond in reality. More importantly, the way the audience responds is to become a speaker who was originally seen on TV in reality. In other words, there is a transformation here: from electronic signals to flesh and blood, from the screen to the uprising scene, from one person to the crowd. If this conversion cannot be completed, the revenge of V cannot be completely realized; as long as the people are not willing to wear the V geek mask, the V revolution will not succeed until the scene agreed by the V geek.
On the day when everyone put on the mask and went out of Congress, V was killed after killing the last two enemies, the head of government and the head of intelligence, and died in Ai Wei’s arms. He handed over the decision to blow up Congress to Ivy, and after V died, Ivy decided to blow up Congress. All the people present at the time of the Congress exploded, taking off the mask and witnessing the collapse of Congress in their own face.
Subject matter
A victim of dictatorship plans to avenge, killing all the perpetrators and calling for stories that lure the people of the country to rise up against the dictatorship.
If you wear a mask on a TV and listen to a speech on TV, wearing a mask is a kind of viewer's approval of V (we are all V geeks), and also the avatar of V (a V becomes a myriad of V) What does the TV screen mean? Are we acting in our own world according to our own will, or are we choosing to agree which message is passed to us and to live the message of our choice?
Selected Readings of Philosophy: Dehida, ""Don't especially be a reporter! 》, pp. 21-25. Adopted version: Jacques Derrida, Surtout, pas de journalistes!, Galilée, 2016.
Document description
De Hida ""especially don't want a reporter! It was the speech of the ""Religion and Media"" conference held at the Dutch Academy in Paris in 1997. The book is basically divided into two parts: the verbatim manuscript of the speech (calculated as the first part) and the participants' questions and Deshida's response (Part 2).
For Dehida, who passed away at the end of 2004, the publication of 1007 is considered to be the maturity of late thought. Most of the published works at this time are related to the overall political-economic-culture and nationality topics in Europe. The content in this book is based on the two themes given by the organizer, as stated at the beginning of the book: duality or ambivalence and father-son. Dehida will soon be the Bible. The story of God, Abraham, and Isaac in Genesis shows the correlation between these two themes. The subject of the father-child relationship does not require much explanation between God, Abraham, and Isaac. It is more important to explain the subject of duality or emotional contradiction.
Since God here asks Abraham to dedicate him to Isaac, it is equal to withdrawing the gift he has given, and at the same time changing Abraham back to the state of no child. This is the first state of change, inside. At the same time, it contains the theme of emotional contradiction. Especially for Abraham, this is a secret that cannot be revealed with God and represents God's test of Abraham. Of course, the test of faith in the form of secrets is the second most important condition, and it also implies Abraham's emotional commitment, because he is forbidden to tell his wife. Then, for Isaac, it is the third state, that is, it also presents emotional contradictions, because Isaac felt abnormal when he started and on the road, but he was willing to follow and believe his father as a son, even if he At the moment of being tied up and ready to be killed, the Bible does not tell us any of Isaac’s resistance, but we can say that Qi Keguo’s “Fear and Thriller” has already expressed the duality of Isaac’s state. Well, perhaps here is the state in which Dehida wants to lay the link and development of the theme, and then he turns to the transformation of the relationship between the media and beliefs, religion and technology in contemporary life.
In fact, this change is from the appearance of Jesus Christ. However, Dehida is not going to talk directly about the emergence of Jesus Christ and then to promote the establishment of Christianity, but to talk about the combination of the Christian faith with the US technology-economy-capitalism. Therefore, he will start from the secret between God and Abraham and say that there can be no ""intermediary"" in this secret relationship, even if it is Christ Jesus or anything else with ""message"" / ""gospel"" / The existence of an intermediary related to ""new"" (in French is nouvelle) is never allowed. The ""reporter"" in the title of the book is actually a contemporary social representative of ""bonne nouvelle"", communication (good) news or news (nouvelle). The object represented by this is television, which can also be translated as ""télé-vision"", which is the intermediary of the performance of technology and the transformation of life.
From the 19th century photography and invention to the rapid development of technology since television, people's lives are slowly changing. They can accept all the news/messages of the world without personal experience, and the news/message is considered to be truly and directly Passed out, that is, ""good news"" (gospel). TV is probably a far-end communication tool that became popular in the second half of the twentieth century and after World War II. It can transcend the remote technology products of time and space. The invention of television not only makes culture spread faster, but also allows religion to be secularized. One of the meanings is that people no longer have secrets. The transcendence of TV sets coincides with the transcendental meaning of religion. TV is a tool for the spread of the gospel. It is the question that Dehida wants to explore: ""TV-Christian-American-capitalist society-cultural hegemony"" The sequence, a so-called ""religious"" or ""religious"" return phenomenon, does not necessarily carry the inherent habits and traditions of the religion itself.
Therefore, before entering our literature, Dehida asked why today's media (especially the United States) are occupied by Christian media, that is, the media ""globalization"" and ""worldization"", or for him It should be called the media ""mondialatinisation"", which is a continuation of the world hegemonic image tradition of the symbiosis of the media ""Christian-Roman-Latin"". This is the first question he asked, and we quoted the second one. So, in the first question, he believes that today's media make people visible by means of rituals or sacrifices in Christianity (generally called ""physical"" or ""incarnation""). God can be visualized or actualized on the TV or through the media of remote technology. In this way, as long as you have any kind of remote technology, it is like Jesus evangelism can pass ""God"" to us. It can also be said that perhaps Christianity enters into our daily lives through remote technology and media in the contemporary era, that is, the globalization or secularization of religion, that is, the modernization or modernization of Christianity.
Literature analysis
The second question of Dehida is about the relationship between ""religious return"" and the media.
Send messages via TV, or any of our current software and hardware technology devices. But being able to pass it out means that the message or the thing must be transformed into its entity. This is the spiritual or spiritual concept of physicalization. The media belongs to this spirit or the spread of ghosts, because the physical presence must be completed through media such as television or our mobile phones. The body or the material itself cannot be transmitted, and the transmission must be spiritual. But because of this kind of media mechanism (television, etc.), each of us is directly in contact with God (live or on-site connection, etc.). Each of us is like Abraham and has this open secret. The development of contemporary remote technology makes it possible to be absent, to be present in the absence of the body, and to have the flesh without physical body. This is the virtual concept of the flesh.
Therefore, this ""religious return"" problem is similar, that is, it points out that there is no longer the essence of religion, but there is a return of religious form. Here, Dehida is called a process of spiritualization or spiritualization, and this process Always connected to the language and nation state (État-nation), the opposite of the international connection. We can see here that the effectiveness of the far-end communication brought by the media is not the superficial globalization, but the national identity and language identity. It is like a movie, whether it is a V geek or a dictator who uses TV to play his own images and words. This utterance and video directly enters everyone's home, even into everyone's consciousness. What the media broadcasts through television is the self-content to be revealed, rather than an open international vision. Then Christianity here is the form that consolidates the American media. It transmits the gospel and transmits Jesus, and also conveys the national discourse. So this is a closed journey, not open or international.
However, Dehida mentioned that TV is a technology against itself. Because TV is a medium of direct (live), let us feel real presence through it, so that our awareness can be immediately realized through vision. ""Eccentricity."" And digitizing these images is to accelerate the Christian spirit or to virtualize and ghost. The media or remote technology is the reappearance of the hegemony of ""Greek-Roman-Christianity"". This hegemony is still political, economic and religious. Therefore, media technology puts faith before things themselves, people no longer need faith, just watching (television) is enough. Watching is faith.
This viewing is ""appel à la foi"". This thing is present in front of our eyes, so this medium has no medium, and this is the way they object. Television and remote technology let us live together with these distant things, like miracles. But through the secularization and globalization of religion, even television or media, religious communication has spread on television or in various media technologies. TV has therefore canceled itself, because television is an intermediary for live broadcasts. This concept is self-contradictory. How can mediation require mediation? At the same time, now we can use the mobile phone to light and worship, and use virtual reality to visit temples several kilometers away. So, we have been transformed by the media and the media. We have established a larger national community. Through a common language and living community, we began to believe in the new religion of the media. The media presented the nakedness to us without secrets. We can easily touch and watch religion or whatever we want, and everything is more transparent and more covert.
In the movie, the V geeks reveal that the government wants to cover up, and everything that the government exposes is actually to cover those that cannot be made public. So this is what Deschida wants to tell us. Technology and the media are secretly (but clearly and clearly) or colluded with the religion-government. This kind of nepotism’s capitalist relationship makes nationalism more broad, not People are more open to the international community. This is why V geeks finally let go of the decision to the heroine Ivy, because it symbolizes no longer interfere with the image of communication or any other beliefs or ideologies, but the people’s own decision, everyone Get rid of the decisions made by any medium or intermediary. And such decisions are international and present, not ghostly.

Watching a movie is as simple as you can imagine, nine classic movies, nine philosophical reflections

This is an era of abundant images. In this age of images, your way of thinking is also restricted by images; in the age of images, you must be more vigilant in considering the composition of images.
Taiwan has emphasized civic education in recent years and hopes to cultivate students' ability to think independently, including philosophical thinking. The challenge of how to put philosophical thinking closer to life, not falling into the scope of expertise, without losing the philosophical qualities is not small.
Watching movies is a daily routine that is more common in life.
A movie is not just a movie. It projects a plane of image motion, and it gathers different time streams. Even public life or private space is penetrated by such strange time and space. There are many levels that can be excavated, even in imagination. In the middle of the opening a great tension.
The special feature of this book is that the author does not deliberately philosophize the film or philosophize, but divide it clearly into two single topics for discussion. Therefore, each chapter will be presented in the order of film information, lens image, lens, scene, narrative or story, subject, and question, allowing readers to follow the author's narrative, carefully enter the film, wear visual and intuitive, and then deep into philosophy. When you understand the operation of a philosophical language and know how to read a movie, you will understand that the image ""what to say, not to say anything, or to leave nothing"". At this time, it is reasonable to insert a question of philosophical thinking. Conversely, there is a wealth of philosophical knowledge, which is helpful in refining some problem settings and borrowing image movements for reasoning.

""The World of Truman"": Why do we think that after Truman leaves the arranged life, he will get true ""happy freedom""?
""Key Report"": Can a person with a criminal intent be constituted a criminal?
""Irritation 1995"": Why does the protagonist not hesitate to be confined and play music? What does ""hope"" mean in life?

Think through images, question images, find subtle but complementary links, and use more accessible pipelines to trigger more thinking. Although images are not truths, they may not reveal the truth, but they often form a curtain to manipulate our perceptions and feelings about the real world. Now let's watch the movie together!
