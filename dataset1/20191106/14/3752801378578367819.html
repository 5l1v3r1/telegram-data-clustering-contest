      <p>A cyclist who was fired after flipping the bird - making a rude single-fingered gesture - to US President Donald Trump's motorcade has been elected to local office in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Juli Briskman, whose one-handed salute was captured in an AFP photograph that went viral, beat the Republican incumbent to a seat on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in state elections that saw Trump's Republican party suffer a series of stinging defeats.</p>
      <p>The single mother of two teens lost her job as a marketing analyst for a US government and military subcontractor after the snapshot of her gesture spread across media and the internet in 2017, bringing her insults and threats.</p>
      <p>But getting fired also opened "a lot of doors", the 52-year-old said during her campaign, including accepting an invitation to run for local office on the Democratic ticket.</p>
      <p>That decision paid off on Tuesday night, as Briskman celebrated her victory in a tweet that linked to a copy of the image.</p>
      <p>"Looking forward to representing my friends &amp; neighbors in #Algonkian District who backed me up today! So proud that we were able to #FlipLoudpun," she wrote.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Republican losses</b>
      </p>
      <p>With 52% of the vote after 99% of precincts had reported, the result saw Republican Suzanne Volpe beaten into second place.</p>
      <p>When fighting her campaign in Loudoun County - the wealthiest in the US - Briskman didn't bring up the image that sparked her 15 minutes of fame unless homeowners started "talking about the administration" or commented on her bicycle pin.</p>
      <p>Instead, the ultramarathon runner told AFP she wanted to show that there was "substance" behind her candidacy - education, women's rights, transportation and environmental issues - and that she wasn't "just the person that rode my bike one day and flipped off the president".</p>
      <p>Her success comes as Trump's party also lost control of both chambers of the legislature in increasingly blue Virginia, US media including The New York Times projected.</p>
      <p>Democrats will now hold all major state-wide offices and rule the state assembly, a comprehensive consolidation of power not seen in the state since the 1990s.</p>
