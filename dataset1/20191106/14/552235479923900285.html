      <p>Ex <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> footballer Joey Barton will go on trial next year accused of assaulting former Barnsley boss Daniel Stendel during an incident following a League One match.</p>
      <p>Barton, 37, is alleged to have pushed the German at Oakwell on April 13, leaving him with a damaged tooth.</p>
      <p>The Fleetwood Town manager pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he appeared at Sheffield Crown <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A provisional trial date was fixed for June 1 2020.</p>
      <p>Barton, of Fox Bank Close, in Widnes, Cheshire, stood in the glass-fronted dock, flanked by a security officer, for the 15-minute appearance.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>He spoke to confirm his name and date of birth, that he is a UK national, and that he understood various matters outlined by the judge.</p>
      <p>Wearing a dark blue jacket over an open-necked light blue shirt and sporting glasses, he also spoke to enter his not guilty plea to the single charge.</p>
      <p>The ex-Manchester City, Newcastle and Burnley player was charged following an incident in the tunnel after the match between Barnsley and Fleetwood, which ended in a 4-2 victory for the home team.</p>
      <p>Barton was given unconditional bail by Judge Jeremy Richardson QC.</p>
