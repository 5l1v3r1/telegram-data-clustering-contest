農業的轉型正義並非想像中浪漫
從建立健康土壤、保留好種子，再到加工和製作，過程中在每個環節付出努力的人，和心懷感激咬下食物的人，都促成了作物的增值和轉型行為。商業型農業是以利益為導向，若想建立非商業型的食物鏈，過程必須要透明化，讓大家看到彼此的工作，而且搭配適當機械、存儲空間、物流條件等配套措施，否則「當地產」一詞就會淪為魔幻，而且一點也不寫實。
農業的改變不是一夕之間發生的，但二十五年來，在蒙特婁西邊的魁北克隆培農場（Les Fermes Longpres）一直在重新定義自己。直到最近，農場的定義延伸到包括我最喜歡的事，也就是麵粉研磨。
當父親決定與已在農耕的兄弟分開土地後，路易奇・德瓦林於一九九○年回到家族農場。「收益並不夠分給所有人，所以我們必須尋找替代方案。」路易奇說，他放棄了工業工程師的事業。傳統玉米和大豆是農場的產品，我們必須增加這些產品的價值。
「一開始，我們就在尋找一項計畫轉型生產，以傳遞給消費者。」路易奇說，他的英文美妙地摻合著法語腔。他們從事的第一項計畫是壓榨所種植的向日葵種子來生產油。
「增值」（Value-added）是美國形容增加農場產品價值的術語，不管是在農場或在其他場所內。「轉型行為」（La transformation, the transformation）只能粗略地翻譯成「加工」或「增值」。然而，茱莉・道森在法國和會烘焙及研磨的農夫合作過，她說美國的同義詞並不能精準捉到這個法語術語所暗示之事，麵包師討論的工藝技巧更能捕捉它的含意。「工業轉型」（Transformation industriel, industrial transformation）指的是工業加工，因此，這樣的言外之意可能會取決於語境而消失。
雖然路易奇並沒有戲劇性地使用「轉型」或「轉型行為」的字詞，但農夫和貨品間的關係聽起來更加親切了。對我而言，這展示了「增值」一詞所沒有的情感。農場若想在龐大銷售量的範圍外成功，這樣的實踐方式就至關重要，果醬生產者與他們的莓果間不缺連結，起司製作者和他們的乳牛也沒有，但「增值」聽起來很科學味，並不親民。「轉型」或「轉型行為」較能代表這樣的連結。
葵花油賣得很好，但他們的計畫本來就不是要仰賴單一作物，而培育這樣特定的作物也很棘手。然而，做葵花油的過程是家族農場典型的探索方式，示範傳統穀物如何轉型以提供更多經濟來源。
從廣義上來說，農場一直在修正。但農場並不像工廠，有能夠處理固定數量材料的機器。每個季節都是可以嘗試新用具或策略的機會，農夫生來就是改革者，懂得隨機應變，因為他們時常得湊合著用手邊現有的東西。當路易奇搬回家時，農場的正常工作進行狀態轉變成一項激進的計畫，他的兄弟們選擇從傳統生產轉至有機生產，並不再進行商業銷售。
作為一個工程師，路易奇被訓練成要謹慎注意系統和解決方法。路易奇和他的兩個兄弟，現在還加上他的兒子，在農場裡從頭開始調查各個元素和改革處理的步驟。從收購種子到土壤組成，一切都在嚴密控管下。
「我們嘗試尋找在這領域中最好的運作組合，盡其所能地尊重環境。」路易奇說。農場大約一千五百英畝大。從商業化生產的玉米和大豆銷售轉型，並不單純只跟錢有關，而是一條和農場健康與自給自足有關的道路。路易奇猜想這樣對於自主的追求是遺傳的。
路易奇於二○一二年年初在佛蒙特這樣告訴一群農夫和食物運動的活躍份子：「二次大戰間，我的父親搬到法國一座被占領的小型農場，有高達六十個人住在裡面。那是六十五年前的事了，很多人挨餓，但他們能夠不依靠已經失敗的外部系統而存活下來。」
北部糧食種植者協會（The Northern Grain Growers Association）邀請了路易奇在年度會議上擔任主講人。那時我不懂為何保存種子很重要，追隨麵粉之後的兩年，我仍然沒有意識到種子的重要性。我追溯著小麥到田地間，卻只把重點放在農耕產品上而非過程。路易奇說的話並沒有影響我以消費為主的狹隘思考，但我盡職地做筆記。

「我們轉移到有機農業，重要的是要讓投入支出最小化，也要維持種子供給。」他說。「當你生產自己的種子時，能得到品質好且健康沒有疾病的種子，不必使用外國的種子。」

只挑最好的種子對種子生產者來說無法負擔，但農夫可以。路易奇建議農夫儲存看來最好的農田和作物的種子，用以生產。他用投影片展示出符合需求的設備，並且講述保存而非購買種子背後的哲理。
「我們需要能適應土壤等條件的種子。」他說。「種子就像移民。移民要一段時間才能融入一個新地方，為什麼不為作物做同樣的事？」
除了這些原因，玉米和大豆也要考慮到基因改造的汙染（基因改造小麥尚未上市，所以不是問題），因為這是種子控制的一般性問題（編按：基因改造作物的隱憂之一，就是可能會使病毒產生突變或互相繁殖，對環境造成汙染）。在魁北克，因為政府的鑑定規定，你必須要捍衛使用自己種子的權利。這些規定跟加拿大其他地方不同，但在歐洲的農夫面臨著更加嚴格的種子銷售和使用規則。二○○三年，一個由農夫帶領的聯盟在法國成立，為的是對抗種子壟斷和作物生物多樣性的侵蝕，該聯盟稱為農夫種子網絡（Reseau Semences Paysannes, the Peasant Seeds Network）。這個網絡／運動是一項鼓舞人心的事。
「我們認為在魁北克也可以做一樣的事。」他說。「要推廣生物多樣性及打擊種子工業的合併，這種活躍的種子對話比種子銀行還好。」
為了達到那樣的目標，他和兄弟組成了魁北克有機農業（Agrobio Quebec）合作社。此團體於二○○六年開始，有五座農場分享想法和資源。現在共有二十四個農場成員，全部皆是有機糧食作物的生產者，一起合作保護良好的種子供給，並發展行銷機會。這樣的合作簡化了為掙脫商業化生產鏈而必須做的銷售努力，所有成員能夠一起合作，減少基因改造食品測試的成本，並研究適合有機生產的種子品種。
農夫總是在研究好的品種，而當路易奇和家人轉移至有機生產時，建立土壤健康變成尋找好品種過程中最重要的一環。他們識別了適合當地土地和氣候的品種，也於耕作的土地上開發各種類型的土壤。
培育有機農作的主要原則，從土壤的健康狀況開始。這不僅僅意味著不加化學肥料，也代表積極培養好土壤結構和健康狀況，就和培養作物的健康一樣。長期關注土壤狀況，才能實現獲得健康且具收益效果作物的短期目標。所有農夫都知道土壤是他們的媒介、基石，也因此土壤需要被妥善照顧。
「我們投資了很多時間和金錢在改善土壤結構上，尤其因為過去幾年下的雨更加集中了。」路易奇說。
隆培農場的作物輪作制一般是四年，在大豆、玉米、小麥、燕麥、向日葵種子、豌豆、和覆蓋作物間輪換。有機農作的慣例並不會限制他們做的事。
「我們嘗試尋找最好的運作組合，盡其所能地尊重環境。我們做了水準測量，也做了一些暗管排水。我們使用更多綠色有機肥料為土壤施肥並維持其健康。」路易奇說。裏土耕犁（Subsoiling），或者說是比傳統耕犁法犁掘地更深，是他們使用的另一個方法。這能釋放空間讓根部長得更深，隨著強大卻間歇性陣雨帶來的氣候變化，這是得優先考慮的事。然而，減少中耕也是一項目標，為的是將土壤結構的干擾最小化。
一般而言，中耕指的是使用犁和其他設備處理田地和作物，但在有機農作裡，這個術語通常指的是牽引機的附屬機具與雜草的搏鬥。中耕會引起土壤侵蝕、結構劣化和有機物質的喪失。傳統農耕中，若是不中耕或低中耕，就得仰賴化學物質來控制雜草。路易奇與兄弟們和其他農夫一樣，試著結合有機農作與低中耕或不中耕的方法。
在這些改變之間，家族最終有時間注意到另一項轉型計畫。組成他們大約七五％的生產是小麥和大豆，因此兩種作物都需要考慮。然而，有機大豆比有機小麥容易行銷，因為作物要的是更穩定、更耐久的價格。
「我們認為視察有助於行銷小麥，這是個好主意。」路易奇說。四年前，他們開始考察麵粉市場。此區域已經有幾座小型石磨坊，和一座某種程度上大一點的小型磨坊——米蘭內斯磨坊（Milanaise），使用輥磨機和石磨來磨製全麥和白麵粉。
在魁北克採訪麵包師期間，他的家人看到白麵粉的需求仍然很高。然而，他們發現自己仍陷於是否使用輥磨機研磨的兩難。現代輥磨機是為了高容量的生產所建造，不是為了農場的自力更生。這項難題的解決辦法是回收設備，也符合他們的偏好。他們重新考慮既有的材料，以處理其他基本需求，從製作榨油機到建造一臺種子精選設施。畢竟修補工作和時間比資金更容易取得，也比債務更令人嚮往。
「我們當時不需要大型的裝置。我們想做成本合理的事，因為我們只是一座農場，沒有像大型工業一樣的財力。」路易奇說。經由一位顧問熟人的幫忙，他在法國一處廢棄磨坊裡找到某些適合的設備。他們使用大約是一九五○年的老舊研磨機具和新篩粉機，拼裝組合出一個新設計。
這項計畫費時三年：一年用來建造新建築物；一個長長的冬天用來拆卸和重新配裝機器；另一個冬天則用來安裝系統。
「因為機器閒置了幾年，必須整修一下。我們裝上板金，重新架置所有設備。」路易奇說。輥磨機其實是一系列的磨粉機，由成對的波形鋼製滾筒組成，能將穀粒切成碎塊。想像一下洗衣機絞擰衣物的狀態就差不多了，每組滾筒或支架都被包覆著或裝在容器裡，這座新的舊磨坊有六個滾筒支架。小麥在研磨時被分成許多部分，也是輾磨工選擇用來組合成麵粉的最後部分。因為這樣的分隔，即使經過篩選，輥磨機還是比石磨機更能製作白麵粉。
現代輥磨機運作速度是每分鐘八百或九百轉速，但這座磨坊運轉地非常緩慢，大約每分鐘三百轉速。愈慢的速度愈沒有效率，但這不是一場比賽。路易奇相信較慢的速度能製造出更好的品質。用這樣的速度以及在篩選和重新組合上的選擇，就能製作出細緻的白麵粉。
二○一四年秋天，加拿大的貨物開始分配，麵粉樣本如今則是慢慢流傳至南方，到了新英格蘭的麵包師那裡。目前磨坊只研磨他們自己的穀物，但最終會處理來自合作社其他農夫的小麥。
「我們有時間，而且想要把事情做好。」路易奇說。「我們想要先處理小容量的麵粉，然後再慢慢增加。要到達一般磨坊的生產力，需要花費幾年時間。」
此磨坊的設計可製作一年一千噸的麵粉，但在他們完善營運的第一年，可能只能製作三百噸。這在白麵粉市場裡是很小的數量，正常應是一年大約三十萬噸，即便是更小的磨坊，如米蘭內斯磨坊和香普蘭山谷研磨，都能處理這座磨坊永遠也無法達到的更多容量。
「我認為我們大概是此區域最小的輥磨磨坊。」路易奇說。的確，這是一個區別，一個他們不想要動搖的區別。他們想結合另一個經濟活動，這僅是多元系統的其中一部分，因此縱使麵粉是個關於容量的遊戲，他們能夠設定自己想要玩的數字。
他們做的選擇讓他們能創造出特殊的事物。將設備支出最小化，並自行從事大部分的勞力工作，使得他們有所選擇並能保持耐心。他們不需要賣麵粉給所有人。
「你可以培養關係，創造一個你想要的網絡。」路易奇說。有些關係來自邊界南部。藍迪・喬治來自佛蒙特蒙佩利爾的紅母雞烘焙公司（Red Hen Baking Company）。他通常戴著一個自行車賽車帽，並且總是在笑。他在磨坊開幕前參觀了磨坊，並對麵粉感到興趣。藍迪取得來源的方式很有創意，他到處尋找最好的麵粉。
「跟藍迪在一起，我發展了一個有趣的門路，那正是當時我想要發展的類似關係。」路易奇說。「這項計畫的想法是和若干麵包師保持合作，因為我沒辦法供應太多的麵包師。」
於美國麵包師工會舉辦，關於烘焙測試當地麵粉的小麥莖論壇上，藍迪使用了路易奇的某些麵粉。他很滿意法國長棍麵包的乳脂顏色和質地，並開始用賽德斯磨坊（Moulin des Cedres）的麵粉製作烘焙坊裡所有的法國長棍麵包。除了麵粉的性能，能與一個在農場裡的磨坊合作，這個前景深深吸引著藍迪，這樣的磨坊更能夠忠誠地提供良好的品質。
「大型輾磨工的其中一項問題是，他們很難在一年裡生產一致性的東西。」路易奇說。「那不是我的問題，因為我想從這個區域將小麥轉型，生產一樣的品種，締造一樣的環境。」
那樣的小麥會是農場所擁有，結合兩個品種的硬紅春小麥所種植出的小麥，擁有很好的烘焙特性，蛋白質含量能達到一一和一三％之間。他們正試著找尋新的類型，並與寶達家族針對加拿大種子安全的先導計畫（Bauta Family Initiative），從事一項小麥育種參與計畫。經由此計畫，來自曼尼托巴大學的安・恪克與橫跨加拿大的農夫合作，在農場上的試驗區種植作物，讓農夫選擇想要的品種並進行雜交。對路易奇來說這是一場小麥任務，其他農場正在發掘其他作物。
類似的作物育種調查，像是茱莉・道森在法國所進行的調查，以及那些由在佛蒙特的農夫和研究員從事的調查，都激勵了這項工作。傑克・拉澤是當中的其中之一。

""Transformation Justice in the Name of Food"": ""Agricultural Transformation Justice"" Is Not Imagining Romance
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is ""we move to organic agriculture. It is important to minimize input expenditure and maintain seed supply,"" he said. ""When you produce your own seeds, you can get seeds of good quality and health without disease, and you don't have to use foreign seeds.""



Text: Amy Halloran
Agricultural transformational justice is not an imaginary romance
From building healthy soils, preserving seeds, to processing and production, people who work hard at every stage of the process, and those who are grateful for biting food, have contributed to the value-added and transformational behavior of crops. Commercial agriculture is profit-oriented. If you want to establish a non-commercial food chain, the process must be transparent, so that everyone can see each other's work, and with appropriate machinery, storage space, logistics conditions and other supporting measures, otherwise ""local production The word will become magical and not at all realistic.
The change in agriculture did not happen overnight, but in the past 25 years, Les Fermes Longpres, west of Montréal, has been redefining itself. Until recently, the definition of the farm extended to include my favorite thing, that is, flour grinding.
When the father decided to separate the land from the brothers who had been farming, Luigi Devalin returned to the family farm in 1990. ""The benefits are not enough for everyone, so we have to find alternatives."" Luigi said he gave up the career of industrial engineers. Traditional corn and soybeans are farm products, and we must increase the value of these products.
""In the beginning, we were looking for a project to transform production to pass on to consumers."" Luigi said that his English is beautifully blended with the French language. The first project they worked on was to squeeze the sunflower seeds planted to produce oil.
Value-added is a term used by the United States to describe increasing the value of farm products, whether on farms or in other locations. ""Laform transformation, transformation"" can only be roughly translated into ""processing"" or ""value added"". However, Julie Dawson has worked with farmers who cook and grind in France. She said that American synonym does not accurately capture the implications of this French terminology, and the craftsmanship discussed by the baker captures its meaning. ""Transformation industriel"" (industrial transformation) refers to industrial processing. Therefore, such an implication may disappear depending on the context.
Although Luigi did not use the words ""transformation"" or ""transformation behavior"" dramatically, the relationship between farmers and goods sounded more cordial. For me, this shows the emotions that are not in the word ""value added"". If the farm wants to succeed outside the scope of huge sales, this practice is crucial. There is no shortage of links between the jam producers and their berries. The cheese makers and their cows do not, but the value-added It is very scientific and not close to the people. ""Transformation"" or ""transformation behavior"" is more representative of such a link.
Sunflower oil sells well, but their plans are not based on a single crop, and cultivating such a specific crop is tricky. However, the process of making sunflower oil is a typical way of exploring family farms, demonstrating how traditional cereals can be transformed to provide more economic sources.
In a broad sense, the farm has been revised. But farms are not like factories, they have machines that can handle a fixed amount of material. Every season is an opportunity to try new tools or strategies. Farmers are born to be reformers and know how to adapt, because they often have to do what they have with their hands. When Luigi moved home, the state of the farm's normal work turned into a radical project, and his brothers chose to switch from traditional production to organic production and no longer sold commercially.
As an engineer, Luigi was trained to be cautious about systems and solutions. Luigi and his two brothers, now with his son, began investigating the various elements and reforming steps from the ground up on the farm. From the acquisition of seeds to the composition of the soil, everything is under strict control.
""We try to find the best combination of operations in this field and do our best to respect the environment,"" Luigi said. The farm is about 1,500 acres. The transformation from the commercial production of corn and soybean sales is not just about money, but a road related to farm health and self-sufficiency. Luigi conjectured that this pursuit of autonomy is hereditary.
Luigi told a group of farmers and food activists in Vermont in early 2012: ""Between the Second World War, my father moved to an occupied small farm in France, where up to 60 people lived. That was sixty-five years ago. Many people are hungry, but they can survive without relying on external systems that have failed.""
The Northern Grain Growers Association invited Luigi to be the keynote speaker at the annual conference. At that time, I didn't understand why it was important to preserve the seeds. After two years of following the flour, I still didn't realize the importance of the seeds. I traced the wheat to the field, but only focused on farming products rather than processes. What Louise said did not affect my narrow thinking about consumption, but I took notes with due diligence.

""When we move to organic agriculture, it is important to minimize input expenditures and maintain seed supply,"" he said. ""When you produce your own seeds, you can get seeds of good quality and health without disease, and you don't have to use foreign seeds.""

Picking the best seeds is not affordable for seed producers, but farmers can. Luigi advises farmers to store the seeds of the best crops and crops for production. He uses slides to showcase the devices that meet the needs and tells the philosophy behind saving rather than buying seeds.
""We need seeds that can adapt to conditions such as soil,"" he said. ""Seeds are like immigrants. It takes a while for immigrants to integrate into a new place. Why not do the same for crops?""
In addition to these reasons, corn and soybeans should also take into account the pollution of genetic modification (genetically modified wheat is not yet on the market, so it is not a problem), because this is a general problem of seed control (editing: one of the hidden concerns of genetically modified crops is that Will cause the virus to mutate or reproduce, causing pollution to the environment). In Quebec, because of government regulations, you must defend your right to use your own seeds. These regulations are different from those in other parts of Canada, but farmers in Europe face stricter rules for seed sales and use. In 2003, a farmer-led alliance was established in France to combat seed monopoly and crop biodiversity, called the Reseau Semences Paysannes, the Peasant Seeds Network. This network/sport is an inspiring thing.
""We think we can do the same thing in Quebec,"" he said. ""To promote biodiversity and combat the consolidation of the seed industry, this active seed dialogue is better than the seed bank.""
In order to achieve such goals, he and his brother formed the Agrobio Quebec cooperative. This group started in 2006 and has five farms sharing ideas and resources. There are now twenty-four farm members, all of whom are producers of organic food crops, working together to protect good seed supply and develop marketing opportunities. Such collaboration simplifies the sales efforts necessary to break away from commercial production chains, and all members can work together to reduce the cost of genetically modified food testing and to study seed varieties suitable for organic production.
Farmers are always researching good varieties, and when Luigi and his family move to organic production, building soil health becomes the most important part of the process of finding good varieties. They identified varieties suitable for local land and climate, and also developed various types of soil on cultivated land.
The main principles of cultivating organic farming begin with the health of the soil. This means not only the absence of chemical fertilizers, but also the active cultivation of soil structure and health, just like the health of cultivated crops. Long-term attention to soil conditions can achieve short-term goals for healthy and profitable crops. All farmers know that soil is their medium and cornerstone, and therefore the soil needs to be taken care of.
""We have invested a lot of time and money in improving the soil structure, especially because the rain has been more concentrated in the past few years,"" Luigi said.
The crop rotation system at Longpei Farm is generally four years, rotating between soybeans, corn, wheat, oats, sunflower seeds, peas, and covered crops. Organic farming practices do not limit what they do.
""We try to find the best combination of operations and do our best to respect the environment. We made leveling and made some dark pipe drainage. We use more green organic fertilizer to fertilize the soil and maintain its health."" Luigi Say. Subsoiling, or deeper than traditional plough ploughing, is another method they use. This frees up space for the Minister to deepen, and with the climate change brought about by powerful but intermittent showers, this is a priority. However, reducing cultivating is also a goal in order to minimize disturbances in soil structure.
In general, cultivating refers to the use of ploughs and other equipment to treat fields and crops, but in organic farming, the term usually refers to the attachment of tractors to weeds. Interplanting can cause soil erosion, structural deterioration, and loss of organic matter. In traditional farming, if you do not cultivate or low-cultivation, you must rely on chemicals to control weeds. Like the brothers and other farmers, Louise tried to combine organic farming with low or no cultivating methods.
Between these changes, the family eventually has time to notice another transformation plan. About seven-five percent of their production is wheat and soybeans, so both crops need to be considered. However, organic soybeans are easier to market than organic wheat because crops require a more stable and durable price.
""We think inspections help to market wheat, which is a good idea,"" Luigi said. Four years ago, they began to look at the flour market. There are already several small stone mills in the area, and a somewhat larger mill, Milanaise, which uses a roller mill and stone mill to grind whole wheat and white flour.
During his interview with the baker in Quebec, his family saw that the demand for white flour remained high. However, they found themselves still stuck in the dilemma of using a roller mill. Modern roller mills are built for high-volume production, not for farm self-reliance. The solution to this problem is to recycle the equipment and also to their preferences. They rethink existing materials to handle other basic needs, from making oil presses to building a seed selection facility. After all, mending work and time are easier to obtain than money, and more desirable than debt.
""We didn't need large installations at the time. We wanted to do something that was reasonable because we were just a farm and didn't have the same financial resources as a large industry,"" Luigi said. With the help of a consultant acquaintance, he found some suitable equipment in an abandoned mill in France. They used an old grinding machine and a new sifter that were about 1950 to assemble a new design.
The plan took three years: one year to build a new building; one long winter to disassemble and refit the machine; the other to install the system in the winter.
""Because the machine has been idle for a few years, it has to be refurbished. We put on the sheet metal and re-install all the equipment,"" Luigi said. The roller mill is actually a series of mills consisting of pairs of corrugated steel drums that cut the grain into pieces. Imagine that the state of the washing machine wringing clothes is almost the same. Each set of rollers or brackets is covered or contained in a container. This new old mill has six roller brackets. Wheat is divided into many parts during grinding and is the last part that the honing worker chooses to combine into flour. Because of this separation, even after screening, the roller mill is more capable of making white flour than a stone mill.
Modern roller mills operate at speeds of 800 or 900 rpm, but the mill operates very slowly, about three hundred rpm. The slower the speed, the less efficient it is, but it is not a game. Luigi believes that slower speeds can produce better quality. With this speed and the choice of screening and recombination, fine white flour can be produced.
In the fall of 2014, Canadian goods began to be distributed, and the flour samples were now slowly spread to the south to the bakers of New England. At present, the mill only grinds their own grain, but eventually it will process the wheat from other farmers in the cooperative.
""We have time and want to get things done,"" Luigi said. ""We want to deal with the small-capacity flour first, and then slowly increase it. It takes a few years to reach the productivity of the general mill.""
The mill is designed to produce 1,000 tons of flour a year, but in the first year of their perfect operation, it could only produce three hundred tons. This is a small amount in the white flour market. Normally it should be about 300,000 tons a year. Even smaller mills, such as the Milanese Mill and the Champlain Valley, can handle this mill and never reach it. More capacity.
""I think we are probably the smallest roller mill in the region,"" Luigi said. Indeed, this is a difference, a difference that they don't want to shake. They want to combine another economic activity, which is only part of a multi-system, so even if flour is a game about capacity, they can set the numbers they want to play.
The choices they make allow them to create something special. Minimize equipment expenditures and do most of the labor on your own, giving them choice and patience. They don't need to sell flour to everyone.
""You can cultivate relationships and create a network you want,"" Luigi said. Some relationships come from the southern part of the border. Randy George is from the Red Hen Baking Company in Montpellier, Vermont. He usually wears a bicycle racing cap and is always laughing. He visited the mill before the opening of the mill and was interested in flour. Randy's way of getting the source is very creative, he is looking for the best flour everywhere.
""With Landi, I developed an interesting way, which was a similar relationship that I wanted to develop at the time,"" Luigi said. ""The idea of this project is to work with a number of bakers because I can't supply too many bakers.""
At the American Bakers' Union, on the wheat stem forum on baking test local flour, Randy used some of Louise's flour. He was very satisfied with the cream color and texture of French baguettes and began making all the French baguettes in the bakery with the flour of the Moulin des Cedres. In addition to the performance of the flour, and the ability to work with a mill on the farm, this prospect is deeply attracted to the Blue Dy, which is more loyal to provide good quality.
""One of the problems with large honing workers is that it is difficult for them to produce consistent things in a year,"" Luigi said. ""That's not my problem, because I want to transform wheat from this region, produce the same variety, and create the same environment.""
Such wheat will be owned by the farm and combined with two varieties of hard red spring wheat, which has good baking characteristics and a protein content of between one and one to three percent. They are trying to find new types and engage in a wheat breeding participation program with the Baoda Family's Bauta Family Initiative. From this project, Angk, from the University of Manitoba, worked with farmers across Canada to grow crops on the farm's pilot area, allowing farmers to select the desired variety and cross. This is a wheat mission for Luigi, and other farms are discovering other crops.
Similar crop breeding surveys, such as the survey conducted by Julie Dawson in France, and the surveys conducted by farmers and researchers in Vermont, motivated the work. Jack Lazer is one of them.

When Monsanto’s seed hits the world’s food, the GM plant and globalization, it is also impacting Taiwan’s small-scale farming community...
Land should be used to cultivate, in order to produce a sustainable panicle. The assets that we can leave to the next generation are from the place of origin to the table, and we can eat the flavor of ""real food.""
Technological development is a double-edged blade. When the world does not match the supply and demand of food, on the one hand, it is trying to increase the production capacity of agriculture. On the one hand, it is necessary to reduce the population growth. The market capital is called “there is no market value without cultivation,” and genetic engineering and biochemical preparations play an important role. We can't help but ask: Who changed our ""bread"" from the place of origin to the table? How to evaluate the profit and contribution of ""True Food""?
