《餐桌上的韓國人》：到十九世紀末才定調的「甜點」概念
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是甜點是在用完主餐後享用的俄式套餐料理的最後，才會被送上桌的食物。身為一個語言學家的丹．尤拉夫斯基，把食物出餐的順序和用餐的順序視為「菜餚的文法」（The Grammer of Cuisine）。



文：周永河（주영하）
到十九世紀末才定調的甜點概念
英文的dessert是一個從法文來的字。原本意為「收拾備好的東西」（to de-serve）的動詞desservir，其分詞被轉為名詞使用。一五九三年左右desservir這個字第一次在法文中被用到，意思是指「收拾餐桌後所吃的」，即餐後享用的甜點。在法國，採用俄式出餐法的套餐料理，會先出前菜或湯，然後是搭配海鮮或蔬菜的肉類作為主餐，最後再送上甜點和轉換口氣的點心。
十八世紀的英式英語和美式英語中，dessert這個單字都有被用到，美國的dessert品項大都由糖度較高的甜食組成。一七八九年，某位住在紐約的知名人士在日記上記錄了自己參與的宴會，並介紹甜點的菜單「甜點：先上了蘋果派、布丁等等，然後是冰淇淋、果凍，再來有西瓜、哈密瓜、蘋果、水蜜桃、堅果類等等。」相對的，英國一八七○～八○年代的宴會，是以前菜開始，依照清湯、濃湯、海鮮、entrée（將禽鳥類整隻烤熟或蒸熟的料理）、肉或piece de reistance（主餐）、雪酪（sherbet，在果汁中加入水、牛奶、砂糖等混合結冰製成的冰品）、烤肉和沙拉、蔬菜、熱甜點、冰淇淋、甜點、咖啡和酒的順序出餐。
在此，我需要重新整理一下dessert的概念。一般說dessert，會有兩種意思。一種是指在使用俄式出餐法的宴會中，主餐之後送上的最後一道料理。雖然每個國家的點心種類都不一樣，但大部分是甜食和咖啡、酒、飲料等等。一般認為水果也屬於甜食，所以常被當成飯後點心送上餐桌。前面介紹過一七八九年紐約的某個宴會，其中甜點也出現了水果和堅果類。
另外一個意思，是指蛋糕、餅乾（cookie）、餅乾（biscuit）、酥皮（pastry，在麵粉裡加入油、牛奶或水拌成麵糰，薄鋪一層層在烤箱中烘烤而成）、冰淇淋、派、布丁、卡士達醬（custard，混合牛奶、砂糖、雞蛋、麵粉後加熱而成）等散發甜味的食物，直接把它們稱為dessert（甜點）。這些甜點雖然會被當成套餐料理的飯後點心最後上桌，但也是獨立的一種點心，就算沒有用餐，也能單獨享用。
英國的「下午茶」（afternoon tea）也屬於代表性的獨立點心之一。下午茶是由茶、三明治、餅乾、蛋糕、酥皮等簡單的食物組合而成。十七世紀時傳進歐洲引發熱潮的中國茶，在英國相當受歡迎。茶葉一開始就像奢侈品般難以取得，十分珍貴，直到英國占領並將印度半島及東南亞部分地區作為殖民地，茶葉的供給才變得順暢許多，逐漸奠定了它作為日常飲料的地位。到了一八五○年代，對英國家庭而言，一邊喝下午茶，一邊進行社交聚會的景象已經成為了日常。下午茶就是在下午四點到五點之間，為了慰勞一下晚餐前空虛的肚子，配著茶吃些簡單的食物，儼然成為英國在十九世紀中、後半，最具代表性的點心。
蛋糕、餅乾、酥皮等甜食和茶、可可、咖啡等飲料會成為對西歐人而言自成一格的點心，其背景原因源自於砂糖的普及。正如美國文化人類學家西敏司（Sidney W. Mintz，1922～2015）所強調的，砂糖至少在十六世紀前都還只是歐洲的上層階級才能享用的昂貴食材，是一種財富與權力的象徵。然而哥倫布（Christopher Columbus，一四五一～一五○六年）於一四九二年抵達美洲大陸後，砂糖便開始以過去歐洲人難以想像的低廉價格，向西歐輸出。

甘蔗的原產地位於澳洲北邊的世界第二大島——新幾內亞。西元前八千年左右，甘蔗的生長開始擴及周邊，在西元前六千年前後擴散至菲律賓與印度半島。將甘蔗汁凝結製糖的最早紀錄，出現在西元前的印度語學家波顛闍利（Patañjali）所寫的《大疏》（Mahābhāṣya）之中。砂糖的英文單字sugar，原本出自梵語的śarkarā，之後受到波斯語影響，再轉變成古代羅馬文後，最後成為英文中被使用的單字。西元七一一年，阿拉伯的伊斯蘭教徒摩爾人，統治了阿拉伯半島，地中海沿岸也開始栽種甘蔗，不過產量仍然非常少。
從十一世紀末開始到十三世紀末的十字軍東征，讓西歐騎士們深深愛上了西亞砂糖製成的糖果（candy）滋味。西歐人對於砂糖的渴望，最終促使他們在非洲西北部的加那利群島（Canary Islands）開始栽種甘蔗。後來哥倫布抵達美洲大陸，隨著歐洲人的腳印越跨越遠，便在各個殖民地栽種甘蔗。尤其是歐洲的企業家，從瓜地馬拉起，開始在中南美地區經營甘蔗栽培農業（plantation），並透過奴役大規模生產，將大部分砂糖都運送到了英國的港口。十八世紀以後，砂糖的生產達到工業化後，價格變得更加低廉，砂糖成為歐洲餐桌上的必備項目。
十七世紀末到十八世紀末之間的蔗糖塊，除了用來製作糖雕外，也被用來製作卡士達醬、烘焙點心、鮮奶油等等。十九世紀以後，甜點之所以可以奠定其日常民生消費品的地位，都多虧了製糖的工業化與大眾化。隨著砂糖普及，茶、咖啡、可可等飲料和蛋糕、餅乾、糕點等食物就成了無論何時都能享用的日常甜點。所以許多經濟學家、地理學家、人類學家都把咖啡樹、茶樹、可可樹、甘蔗等作物稱為「甜點作物」（dessert crops）。
如同前面介紹過的，十九世紀中葉，西歐的宴會出餐方式逐漸換成俄式出餐法。主餐幾乎都是鹹食，用完餐之後口中悶澀，甚至會感到有點不舒服。這時再吃些甜甜的點心，口中便瞬間清爽起來。如果要追究西式甜點的歷史淵源，雖然可以說是經由古代波斯、十世紀前後的巴格達，還有十六世紀屬於伊斯蘭文化圈的西班牙安達盧西亞（Andalusia）和義大利的西西里（Sicilia）傳至歐洲，但在主餐之後一定要享用甜點的西歐觀念，則一直到十九世紀末左右才確立。
我想在這章討論的是，甜點是在用完主餐後享用的俄式套餐料理的最後，才會被送上桌的食物。身為一個語言學家的丹．尤拉夫斯基，把食物出餐的順序和用餐的順序視為「菜餚的文法」（The Grammer of Cuisine）。也就是說，每個語言圈動詞和受詞的順序都有不一樣的文法規則，這同樣被應用到了宴會中送餐的順序和人們享用食物的過程上。其實對母語人士來說，語言的文法是在社會化過程中學到的東西，所以太過自然，甚至不太會意識到。丹．尤拉夫斯基把這稱為「緘默的文化規範」（implicit cultural norms），並認為無論是餐點或用餐的過程，都默默遵守這個規範。
雖然美式晚餐中會在主餐或entrée之後上甜點，但法式晚餐則是主餐結束後上沙拉和起司，之後才是甜點。就像甜點之前上的食物種類會有所不同，在套餐料理後上的點心種類各國也是有所差異。過去的德國人只會喝杯咖啡，法國人只吃甜食，美國人則傾向把蘋果派、布丁、冰淇淋、果凍、西瓜、哈密瓜、蘋果、水蜜桃、堅果類一律視為點心類。
相對地，中國人的正餐之中則沒有點心。而且，中文之中也沒有完全等同於dessert的單字。中國人在吃飯前會喝茶，飯後也是喝茶。韓文中原本也沒有符合dessert的單字。在一九六○年代以前，韓國人開始用餐的時候會最先喝湯，用完餐之後喝鍋巴湯，餐後也不會額外吃什麼甜食。之後到了二十世紀以後，隨著西方人以首爾為首開始居住到近代都市，朝鮮人也開始瞭解西方所謂的dessert這種食物。

""Korean on the Table"": The concept of ""dessert"" that was only adjusted at the end of the 19th century
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the dessert is the last food that can be served on the table after the main meal is served. As a linguist, Dan. Yulovsky, the order of food meals and the order of meals are regarded as ""The Grammer of Cuisine"".



Text: Zhou Yonghe (주영하)
Dessert concept that was set at the end of the nineteenth century
The English dessert is a word from French. The verb desservir, originally intended for ""to de-serve"", has its participle used as a noun. The word desservir was first used in French around 1953, meaning “to eat after the table was cleaned up”, that is, the dessert enjoyed after the meal. In France, the set menu using the Russian-style dining method will first produce the first dish or soup, then the meat with seafood or vegetables as the main meal, and finally the dessert and the tone-changing snack.
In the English and American English of the eighteenth century, the word dessert has been used. Most of the desersert items in the United States consist of sweets with a high sugar content. In 1789, a famous person living in New York recorded his own banquet in his diary and introduced the dessert menu ""Dessert: first apple pie, pudding, etc., then ice cream, jelly, come again There are watermelons, cantaloupe, apples, peaches, nuts, etc."" In contrast, the banquets of the United Kingdom from 1870 to the 1980s began with the dishes, according to broth, soup, seafood, and entrée. Only cooked or steamed dishes), meat or piece de reistance (main meal), snow cheese (sherbet, adding ice, milk, sugar, etc. mixed ice in the juice), barbecue and salad, vegetables In the order of hot desserts, ice cream, desserts, coffee and wine.
Here, I need to rearrange the concept of the dessert. Generally speaking, there are two meanings of dessert. One refers to the last dish served after the main meal in a banquet using Russian dining. Although the variety of snacks varies from country to country, most are sweets and coffee, wine, drinks, and more. It is generally believed that fruit is also a sweet food, so it is often sent to the table as a dessert. I introduced a party in New York in 1789, in which desserts also appeared in fruits and nuts.
Another meaning is cake, biscuit, biscuit, pastry (pastry, adding oil to the flour, milk or water to form a dough, thinly layered in the oven), ice cream Sweet foods such as pie, pudding, custard (mixed milk, sugar, eggs, and flour) are called desserts. Although these desserts will be served as a snack after dinner, they are also an independent snack. Even if you don't have a meal, you can enjoy it alone.
The British ""afternoon tea"" is also one of the representative independent snacks. Afternoon tea is a combination of simple foods such as tea, sandwiches, biscuits, cakes, and meringues. Chinese tea, which was introduced into Europe in the 17th century, is very popular in the UK. Tea was difficult to obtain at the beginning as a luxury. It was very precious. Until the British occupation and the colony of the Indian Peninsula and parts of Southeast Asia, the supply of tea became smoother and gradually established its status as a daily drink. By the 1850s, for British families, the scene of social gatherings while drinking afternoon tea had become a daily routine. Afternoon tea is between 4 pm and 5 pm. In order to comfort the empty stomach before dinner, with tea to eat simple food, it became the most representative snack in the middle and late half of the 19th century.
Cakes, biscuits, meringues and other sweets and tea, cocoa, coffee and other beverages will become a self-contained snack for Western Europeans. The background is due to the popularity of sugar. As emphasized by the American cultural anthropologist Sidney W. Mintz (1922-2015), sugar was only an expensive ingredient enjoyed by the upper classes of Europe at least until the sixteenth century. It is a symbol of wealth and power. However, after Christopher Columbus (1541 - 1506) arrived in the American continent in 1492, the sugar began to be exported to Western Europe at a low price that was unimaginable to Europeans in the past.

The origin of sugar cane is located in New Guinea, the world's second largest island in the north of Australia. Around 8,000 BC, the growth of sugar cane began to spread to the periphery, spreading to the Philippines and the Indian peninsula around 6,000 BC. The earliest record of sugar cane juice condensation was found in the Mahābhāṣya written by the Indian singer Patañjali before BC. The English word sugar of sugar, originally from Sanskrit śarkarā, was later influenced by Persian, and then converted into ancient Roman, and finally became the word used in English. In 1971, Arab Muslim Moors ruled the Arabian Peninsula and began planting sugar cane on the Mediterranean coast, but production was still very small.
From the end of the eleventh century to the end of the thirteenth century, the Westerners knights fell in love with the candy made from the sugar of West Asia. Western Europeans’ desire for sugar eventually led them to start planting sugar cane in the Canary Islands in northwestern Africa. Later, Columbus arrived in the American continent, and as the Europeans crossed their footprints, they planted sugar cane in various colonies. In particular, European entrepreneurs, starting from Guatemala, began to operate sugarcane cultivation in Central and South America, and transported most of their sugar to British ports through mass production through slavery. After the eighteenth century, after the production of sugar reached industrialization, the price became cheaper, and sugar became a must-have item on the European table.
The sucrose block between the late 17th and the end of the 18th century, in addition to making sugar carvings, was also used to make kastal sauce, baked snacks, whipped cream, and so on. After the 19th century, the reason why desserts can lay the foundation for their daily consumer goods is thanks to the industrialization and popularization of sugar. With the popularity of sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa and other foods such as cakes, biscuits, and pastries are everyday desserts that can be enjoyed at any time. Therefore, many economists, geographers, and anthropologists refer to crops such as coffee trees, tea trees, cocoa trees, and sugar cane as ""dessert crops.""
As mentioned earlier, in the mid-nineteenth century, the banquet dining method in Western Europe gradually changed to the Russian dining method. The main meal is almost all salty food. After using the meal, it is stuffy and even a little uncomfortable. At this time, eat some sweet snacks, and the mouth will instantly refresh. If you want to pursue the historical origins of Western-style desserts, it can be said that it was passed through ancient Persia, Baghdad around the 10th century, and Spain's Andalusia, which belongs to the Islamic cultural circle in the 16th century, and Sicilia of Italy. Europe, but the Western European concept of having to enjoy dessert after the main meal was not established until the end of the 19th century.
What I want to discuss in this chapter is that the dessert is the last food that will be served on the table after the main meal is served. As a linguist, Dan. Yulovsky, the order of food meals and the order of meals are regarded as ""The Grammer of Cuisine"". That is to say, each language circle verb and the order of the words have different grammar rules, which is also applied to the order of food delivery in the banquet and the process of people enjoying food. In fact, for native speakers, the grammar of language is something that has been learned in the process of socialization, so it is too natural to even realize. Dan. Yulovsky called this ""implicit cultural norms"" and believed that both the meal and the meal process silently abide by this norm.
Although the American dinner will be served after the main meal or entrée, the French dinner is the salad and cheese after the main meal, after which it is the dessert. Just as the type of food before the dessert will be different, the types of snacks after the set meal will vary from country to country. In the past, Germans only had a cup of coffee. The French only ate sweets. Americans preferred to treat apple pie, pudding, ice cream, jelly, watermelon, cantaloupe, apple, peach, and nuts as snacks.
In contrast, there is no snack in the Chinese dinner. Moreover, there is no single word in Chinese that is equivalent to the dessert. Chinese people drink tea before eating and drink tea after meals. Han Wenzhong did not have a single word that matched the dessert. Before the 1960s, when Koreans started to eat, they would drink the soup first. After using the meal, they would drink the soup, and they would not eat any extra sweets after the meal. Later, after the twentieth century, as Westerners began living in modern cities with Seoul as heads, Koreans began to understand the so-called dessert food in the West.

Listen to the popular K-pop, watch the Korean movies, serials, interesting Korean and practical shows... But have you ever observed how Koreans eat? Want to say why they want to eat like this?
""Why, there seems to be no ceramic utensils on the table?"" ""Why do you want to sit cross-legged?"" ""Why should the rice be packed in a stainless steel bowl?"" ""Can't the spoon and chopsticks be used together?"" ""You can start the whole table after you have set it up."" """" Must I have a cup of coffee after dinner?""
In Korea, you can't hold a bowl for dinner, you have to use a long spoon to lick it; you know the good amount of wine, but you have to pick up the cups used by others. There are chairs but still sitting cross-legged, making foreigners numb... The café is very popular, but the three-in-one is the best!

It turns out that Koreans who study Confucian culture continue to carry out the number of meals! Not only the meals, but also the table configuration and drinking culture are very strict.
