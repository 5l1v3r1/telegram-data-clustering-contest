06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是通讀全書，這只是一位政治專業人士提出他在1970年代末期至1980年代初期的觀察報告，希望對台灣、對國民黨、對黨外人士及台灣人民有所助益而已。文字間展現出一名知識份子對台灣的大愛。不料，警備總部卻將它扣上「否定法律，詆譭法統，淆亂視聽、挑撥政府與人民情感，足以影響民心士氣」，而將之查禁。

《到民主之路》

黃煌雄著 八十年代出版社 1980年10月10日初版
台灣警備總司令部69.10.23. 隆徹字第4615 號函主旨：《到民主之路》一書，內容淆亂視聽、挑撥政府與人民情感，依法查禁，請查照轉知、查照辦理。說明：
一、 黃煌雄著《到民主之路》一書（三十二開本，平裝一冊，二○七頁，發行地址：台北市富錦街一○七巷一弄六號二樓，總經銷：台北市重慶南路三段十二號六樓，於中華民國六十九年十月十日出版），內容否定法律、詆毀法統，淆亂視聽、挑撥政府與人民情感，足以影響民心士氣。
二、 依照〈台灣地區戒嚴時期出版物管制辦法〉第三條第六、第七款及同法第八條之規定予以查禁。
我們深信：不論朝野，在這過程上，都要由「坐而言」，進到「起而行」，且要澈底揚棄所有不實、虛驕、華麗、壓制、逃避、激情、躁進及依賴影子的想法、說法與作法，而以堅定的信念、抉擇、實踐與奉獻的精神，不懈而又無畏地奮鬥。我們更深信：唯有朝野都以這種「質勝於文」的踏實態度，共同心連心、手牽手的實踐，我們才能早日使民主深根成為我們社會中一自然的正常現象；當這一天到來時，我們才有資格對所有在高雄（美麗島）事件中受傷和受苦難的同胞，以及所有對高雄（美麗島）事件的發生及發展感到「遺憾」、「不幸」、「難過」而受驚、流淚、流浪的同胞，給予最深刻的安慰—這也是經過高雄（美麗島）事件的歷史性創傷之後，我們所應肩負的歷史性任務。——黃煌雄本書〈自序〉
《到民主之路》是黃煌雄被警備總部查禁的第一本書，在這之前，他已經出版《論戰國時代的合縱與連橫》、《革命家—蔣渭水》、《被壓迫者的怒吼》及《國民黨往何處去》，本書除〈自序〉外，分為第一部分：到民主之路，內含〈今年五項公職選舉的歷史意義〉等九篇，第二部分：台灣近代民主運動，有〈從蔣渭水精神談起〉等六篇；發表日期是1977年12月至1980年8月，結集成冊是因他參與1980年12月6日的增額立委選舉。
警總的查禁原因相當牽強，這些文章都在黨外雜誌等刊物發表過，黃煌雄是台大政治研究所碩士畢業，文章平實、理論性強，是當時黨外人士裡少數的理論家之一，加上個性文靜，屬於康系的溫和派。
在〈今年五項公職選舉的歷史意義〉（1977年12月）一文，作者指出：從歷史觀點考察，其顯示的意義有：1.新生代力量的崛起。2.支配式角色的消失。3.裁判者的還我面目。
因而，不論朝野對於選舉，應有兩項共同的認識：1.選舉權是全人類共同的遺產，不容任何沾汙。2.在一個政府由人民定期性選出的制度下，辦好選舉乃是政府的義務，而非權利；政府既沒有理由為選舉辦得公平、公正、公開而自豪，所有的候選人也沒有理由為選舉辦得公平、公正、公開而向政府致謝。
經由選舉以產生政府和議會的路線，還是古今中外歷史上所出現過的政權移轉方式中最值得接受的一種……今年五項公職選舉所顯示的意義，已為這種辦法注入新的轉機和希望；為了使這種新的轉機和希望在未來的歲月裡，能夠一步一步順利地展開，在台灣地區以及海外的所有中華民族同胞，不論階級黨派、男女老少、士農工商、貧賤富貴，都有共同的義務，不僅要有這種認識，更要努力具體實踐，以共同為現在千千萬萬以及未來世世代代的同胞，開創一條歷史上尚無先例的健康的民主大道。
〈競爭者之路—國民黨與黨外的健全化〉一文中論及：
中美斷交之後，在國內政治上，一個重大、尖銳、具有逼迫性、又使人無法逃避的問題，已經籠罩在關心台灣前途的每一個人的心坎上，這便是：「台灣往何處去？」其在國內政治因素發展，有兩個相關問題：1.國民黨往何處去？ 2.黨外往何處去？
國民黨這種支配者角色，一面經由行政體系的運用，向全國行政機關延伸；一面經由政治體系的運用，向軍事、學術、經濟、產業、乃至社會各團體延伸，致使國民黨在國內所有機關、團體所扮演的角色，都與其在中央政制所扮演的角色相呼應。
黨外在面對國民黨幾乎壟斷行政和立法的一切職位，力量是微弱的；面對國民黨幾乎壟斷一切宣傳媒體，黨外的聲音是淒涼的；只能在特許的時間（選舉），才有機會公開向民眾講話。

今天國民黨最大的困境：如何使實際與理論協調？因為國民黨三十年來以「革命民主政黨」及「動員戡亂」的理論，來掩飾、包裝其形象，而此種權力惰性，使其自絕於其一再表示的「堅守民主陣容」之外。因此，今天國民黨不但不應該再以排除壓擠其他競爭勢力來鞏固自己的支配地位，而應更以謙虛與誠懇的心情邁向競爭者。
不管國民黨高興與否，經過三十年不正常的憲政時期後，它終得面對一個有競爭者的胸襟、識見與修養的黨外，乃是社會發展的必然趨勢，也是民眾政治意識自覺的結果。因此，競爭者之路，一如國民黨一樣，也代表今後黨外的歷史出路。
當國民黨由支配者走向競爭者，黨外由批評者走向競爭者；也就是國民黨黨外分別走向健全化之路時，真正的民主憲政才能在台灣得到正常的發展。
〈職業革命家・社會運動家・政治改革家〉重刊於《亞洲人》月刊第二期1980年3月號），編者按語：
本文原發表於六十八年八月《八十年代》第三期。作者黃煌雄根據學理和歷史經驗所做的一些立論，不到半年已經因高雄（美麗島）事件的發生以及國內外一連串連鎖事情的發展而不幸言中。當此國家急需療傷止痛的時刻，為了不忍看到我們已經成長和茁壯的社會，因信任不夠，或一時的踟躕，或過於迷信權力而陷入不可預期的災難之中，本刊以極其沉重的心情重刊此文，甚盼能有助於全國上下的知所警惕。
很多關心台灣政治的同胞，困惑地問道：「黨外人士到底在扮演什麼角色？」就世界史加以比較，對既成體系感到不滿的人，通常會有三種反應：

以職業革命家的立場，對既成體系進行全盤的摧毀。
以社會運動家的立場，對既成體系進行強烈的衝擊。
以政治改革家的立場，對既成體系要求合理的改革。

三十年來台灣的黨外人士，只要在政治體制內佔有一席之地的人，都屬於政治改革家的類型。黨外人士在當前體制下並沒有享有平等的競爭地位，他們雖處於劣勢，卻擁有群眾，他們的目標相當有限，僅止於批評，方法也完全合法化。不過，由於黨外人士受到既成體系的歧視與漠視，即使最謹慎保守的黨外人士，有時也不免要衝出政治改革家的範疇，而以社會運動家的胸襟與方式發言，這種現象在選舉時表現得最為徹底。
儘管國民黨一再對海內外宣稱「堅守民主陣容」，實行民主憲政，推行法治，但由於國民黨仍存有濃厚的「打天下」的統治心態，且不改其支配習性，並害怕競爭，當前的政治，不管國民黨在口頭上或文字上如何為自己打扮，實際上所做到的，僅僅是亦民主亦不民主的「猶抱琵琶半遮面」的階段，真正的民主憲政，在台灣雖然已經過「千呼萬喚」，結果仍是「只聞樓梯響，不見人下來。」
就當前的社會條件而言，由於民智的提高、經濟的繁榮與生活的進步，黨外人士的自然邏輯，應是選擇政治改革家的路線；但就當前的政治體制，特別是針對中央政治體制的缺乏代表性與地方政治體制的缺乏合法性而言，黨外人士卻應走上社會運動家之路。所以今天的黨外人士，有如傳統的黨外人士一樣，兼具有政治改革家與社會運動家的雙重任務。
由於既成體系所暴露的僵硬與惰性，黨外人士現階段不僅不應過分奢談政治工作者的角色，且更應集中一切力量，運用一切非暴力方法進行衝擊，使既成體系在新現實的壓力下，不能不做合理的調整。國民黨對於這種迫切的需求，如果不能及早正視，或故意不正視，反要掃除黨外人士在體制之內所做的合理追求時，國民黨將無法完全排除黨外人士走上民國初年國民黨被袁世凱逼迫時，所走的全盤否定既成體系的道路。
我們深願借此需要全民團結的時刻，向居住在台灣的所有同胞，表示誠懇而莊嚴的希望：我們應為二十世紀初期，在台灣海峽兩邊的中華民族祖先所留下的未竟之業共同負責，並以實際的行動，堅定的決心，共同為做一些令祖先、也令子孫感到「差強人意的事業」而全力以赴。
〈當前政治的兩大課題〉（1979年10月）文中，作者很嚴謹的要求執政的國民黨當局應該勇敢面對政治體制兩大問題，那就是：

中央政治體制的代表性。
地方政治體制的合法性。

而多年來，對中央政體的批評，焦點都集中在國會，因為：

國會代表沒有代表性。
國會成員缺乏勝任性。
國會現狀妨礙參與性。

這是由於絕大多數的國會代表，都是三十年前在中國大陸和台灣選出的，而他們卻構成國會的主體，對在台灣生活的同胞而言，毫無代表性；而執政的國民黨卻視之為「法統」，而強力對抗民意。
根據民主政治成長的過程和經驗，還應該強調三點：

現行國會違背民主政治最基本、最通俗的一項原理——任期制度。
現行國會成員產生的方式，與議會政治成長的經驗，根本抵觸。
現行國會違背整個歷史思潮與世界思潮。

中央政治體制改革，最迫切是國會的改選。目前情勢是：維持法統，則缺乏民主；而擴大民主，就會動搖法統。因此，全面改選國會代表是初步目標；全盤調整中央機構編制與職權，才是改革的終極目標。
至於所謂地方政治體制，就現況而言，即指台灣省政治體制。其最大瑕疵之所在：

它使現行地方政治體制顯得不完整，變成跛腳的地方自治。
它顯示執政當局缺乏信心。
它使中華民族蒙羞。

制訂齊一化的省自治法和院轄市自治法，以實行完整的地方自治；再來調整中央及地方的權責和級數，是改進地方政治體制的第二步工作。
現階段的形勢是：沒有台灣，就沒有中華民國政府，中華民國政府沒有今天，也就沒有明天。當中華民國政府與台灣，在實質上，幾乎已變成兩位一體，且有著共同命運時，政府為了生存與發展，自應深切了解生活在台灣地區所有同胞的共同要求與願望。
通讀全書，這只是一位政治專業人士提出他在1970年代末期至1980年代初期的觀察報告，希望對台灣、對國民黨、對黨外人士及台灣人民有所助益而已。文字間展現出一名知識份子對台灣的大愛。不料，警備總部卻將它扣上「否定法律，詆譭法統，淆亂視聽、挑撥政府與人民情感，足以影響民心士氣」，而將之查禁。想一想，這是一個何等荒謬的故事。
作者介紹：黃煌雄，1944年生，宜蘭人，國立台大政研所碩士，曾任黨外及民進黨籍立委及監委，著作有《蔣渭水傳》等，2018年任促進轉型正義委員會主委，後因副主委張天欽之「東廠說」引發社會爭論而辭職。

一張查禁公文，一段台灣史從禁書看台灣的民主化進程


〈台灣地區戒嚴時期出版物管制辦法〉陰影下前仆後繼以文字戰鬥的黨外青春

1979年12月10日國際人權日發生在高雄的美麗島事件（又稱為高雄事件），對台灣往後政局發展有重要影響，媒體關注大審使台灣民眾於此事件後開始關心政治。與此同時，政府當局亦開始加強管控，將原先由新聞局掌管的權限移交至警備總部。
此後，台灣禁書開始一段從印刷廠到銷售，都與警總鬥智鬥勇的歷程。
作者選出的禁書大多被警備總部以違反〈台灣地區戒嚴時期出版物管制辦法〉第三條（出版物不得有左列各款情形之一）的第五款（違背反共國策者）、第六款（淆亂視聽，足以影響民心士氣或危害社會治安者）、第七款（挑撥政府與人民情感者）予以查禁查扣處分。
本書介紹當時被查禁的數百種禁書中較為重要、由1980年9月24日，以隆徹字第4100號一口氣查禁林義雄、姚嘉文的《虎落平陽》及張俊宏的《我的沉思與奮鬥》等五本書談起，到1983年1月12日查禁曹聚仁的《魯迅評傳》為止，一共27本。
藉由本書，莫忘如今作為亞洲自由度最高的台灣社會，是由民主先輩的生命與鮮血、在狹小牢獄間的歲月，與這些曾被禁錮的文字、曾被視為猛獸的紙本鋪墊而成。

本書特色

｜出版品的婆娑之洋．美麗之島｜
如今號稱最自由的華文出版中心、各種書籍類型百花齊放的台灣，很難想像曾經出版是一件被視為「搞政治」、可能「被消失」的職業。
透過本書，那些或熟悉或陌生的作者名字多半與政治相關，但也包括意想不到的金庸《射鵰英雄傳》都在政府查禁之列。（郭靖與黃蓉本人表示震驚）
閱讀本書，如同走了一趟台灣戰後民主運動史，那些名姓、那些事件，無一不影響著解嚴後如今的台灣。從林義雄到陳文成，民主前輩的身影以不同形式成為民主之路的磚瓦。
我們記憶著，以曾經會被查禁、銷毀、逮捕的形式——書籍。

The Road to Democracy

Huang Huangxiong, Eighties Publishing House, October 10, 1980, First Edition
Taiwan Guard General Command 69.10.23. Longchee No. 4615 Letter: The book ""To the Road to Democracy"", the content is confusing, provoke the government and the people's feelings, and banned according to law, please check and transfer. Description:
I. Huang Huangxiong's book ""The Road to Democracy"" (32 copies, paperback, 207 pages, distribution address: 2nd floor, No.6, Lane 1, Lane 1, Lane 1, Fujin Street, Taipei, total distribution: The sixth floor of No. 12, Section 3, Chongqing South Road, Taipei City, published on October 10, 1999. The content denies the law, slanders the law, confuses the audience, and provokes the government and the people's feelings, which can affect the morale of the people.
2. Prohibition shall be banned in accordance with Article 3, Sections 6 and 7 of the Regulations on the Control of Publications in the Period of Stowe in Taiwan.
We are convinced that no matter the ruling and the opposition, in this process, we must ""sit and talk"" and go to ""start"", and we must abandon all falsehood, arrogance, beauty, suppression, escape, passion, and advancement. Relying on the thoughts, expressions and practices of shadows, and with unremitting and fearless struggle with a firm belief, choice, practice and dedication. We are even more convinced that only the ruling and the ruling of this kind of ""quality is better than the text"", the practice of uniting the heart and hands together, we can make the deep roots of democracy a natural normal phenomenon in our society at an early date; When the day comes, we are qualified to feel ""regret"", ""unfortunate"" and ""sad"" to all the compatriots who were injured and suffering in the Kaohsiung (Beautiful Island) incident and all the incidents and developments of Kaohsiung (Beautiful Island). The frightened, tearful, wandering compatriots gave the deepest comfort – this is also the historical task that we should shoulder after the historical trauma of the Kaohsiung (Beautiful Island) incident. ——Huang Huangxiong's book <Self-Order>
""The Road to Democracy"" is the first book that Huang Huangxiong was banned by the police headquarters. Before that, he has published ""On the Combination of the Warring States Period and the Horizon"", ""The Revolutionary - Jiang Yishui"", ""The Roar of the Oppressed"" And ""Where is the Kuomintang going?"", this book is divided into the first part: the road to democracy, including the historical significance of the five public elections this year. The second part: Taiwan's modern democracy movement There are six articles, such as ""From the spirit of Jiang Yushui""; the publication date is from December 1977 to August 1980, and the integration book is due to his participation in the increase of the legislature election on December 6, 1980.
The reasons for the police ban were quite far-fetched. These articles were published in magazines such as the party magazine. Huang Huangxiong graduated from the Institute of Political Science of National Taiwan University. The article was plain and theoretical. It was one of the few theorists in the party outside the party. The personality is quiet and belongs to the moderate of the Kang system.
In the article ""The historical significance of the five public elections this year"" (December 1977), the author points out that from the historical point of view, its significance is: 1. The rise of the new generation of power. 2. The disappearance of the dominant role. 3. The referee's face is also my face.
Therefore, regardless of the ruling and opposition to the election, there should be two common understandings: 1. The right to vote is a common heritage of all mankind and cannot be contaminated. 2. Under a system in which the government is elected by the people on a regular basis, it is the duty of the government, not the right to run the election. The government has no reason to be proud of the fairness, impartiality and openness of the election. There is no reason for all candidates. To thank the government for the fairness, impartiality and openness of the election.
The elections to generate the government and parliamentary routes are also the most acceptable ones in the history of the transfer of power in the history of the past and the present... The significance of the five public elections this year has injected a new turn for this approach. And hope; in order to make this new turn and hope come true step by step in the years to come, all Chinese compatriots in Taiwan and overseas, regardless of class parties, men, women and children, scholars and peasants, and poor and rich, have The common obligation is not only to have this kind of understanding, but also to work hard to practice concretely, to jointly create a healthy democratic road that has no precedent in history for the thousands of people who are now and for generations to come.
""The Road to Competitors - The Perfection of the Kuomintang and the Extraterrestrial Party"":
After the break-up between China and the United States, in the domestic politics, a major, sharp, perpetual, and insurmountable problem has been shrouded in the hearts of everyone who cares about the future of Taiwan. This is: ""Where is Taiwan going?"" ""There are two related issues in the development of domestic political factors: 1. Where does the Kuomintang go? 2. Where is the party going?
The role of the Kuomintang as a dominator extends to the national administrative organs through the use of the administrative system; while extending to the military, academic, economic, industrial, and even social groups through the use of the political system, the Kuomintang is in all organs and organizations in the country. The roles played are echoed by their role in the central government.
Outside the party, in the face of all positions in the Kuomintang’s almost monopolized administration and legislation, the strength is weak; in the face of the Kuomintang’s almost monopolizing all propaganda media, the voice outside the party is bleak; only at the time of the franchise (election), there is a chance. Publicly speaking to the public.

The biggest dilemma of the Kuomintang today: How to harmonize reality with theory? Because the Kuomintang has used the theory of ""revolutionary democratic parties"" and ""mobilization of chaos"" to conceal and package its image for 30 years, this kind of power inertia makes it self-existing in its ""standing democratic lineup"" repeatedly expressed. Therefore, today the Kuomintang should not only try to consolidate other dominant forces to consolidate its dominant position, but should also move towards competitors with modesty and sincerity.
Regardless of whether the Kuomintang is happy or not, after 30 years of abnormal constitutionalism, it will eventually face a party with competitors’ minds, knowledge and cultivation. It is an inevitable trend of social development and a conscious of the political consciousness of the people. result. Therefore, the road of competitors, like the Kuomintang, also represents the historical way out of the party outside.
When the Kuomintang moves from the dominator to the contender, and the critics go to the contender outside the party; that is, when the Kuomintang is going to the path of perfection, the true democratic constitutional government can develop normally in Taiwan.
""Professional Revolutionary, Social Movement, Political Reformer"" was re-published in the ""Asian"" monthly issue, Issue 2, March 1980). Editor's Note:
This article was originally published in the eighth issue of the Eighties in August. Some of the arguments made by the author Huang Huangxiong based on academic and historical experience have been unsatisfactory for less than half a year due to the occurrence of the Kaohsiung (Beautiful Island) incident and the development of a series of chain events at home and abroad. When the country is in desperate need of healing and pain relief, in order to not bear to see the society we have grown and thrived, because of lack of trust, or temporary embarrassment, or too superstitious power to fall into an unpredictable disaster, this magazine has an extremely heavy mood. Re-publishing this article, I hope that it will help the police in the country to be vigilant.
Many compatriots who care about Taiwan's politics have puzzled and asked: ""What role does the non-party person play?"" There are usually three reactions to people who are dissatisfied with the faculty system when they compare world history:

From the standpoint of professional revolutionaries, the entire system was destroyed.
From the standpoint of social activists, it has a strong impact on the established system.
From the standpoint of political reformers, we need reasonable reforms for the established system.

Those who have been outside the party in Taiwan for 30 years, as long as they have a place in the political system, belong to the type of political reformers. Outside the party, they do not enjoy equal competitive status under the current system. Although they are at a disadvantage, they have the masses. Their goals are quite limited. They only end in criticism and the methods are completely legalized. However, because people outside the party are discriminated against and disregarded by the established system, even the most cautious and conservative non-party members sometimes cannot rush out of the scope of political reformers, but speak with the mind and manner of social activists. The election was the most thorough.
Although the Kuomintang has repeatedly declared that it ""holds the democratic lineup"" at home and abroad, implements democratic constitutionalism, and promotes the rule of law, the Kuomintang still has a strong ""going the world"" ruling mentality, and does not change its dominance and fear competition, current politics. Regardless of how the Kuomintang dresses up for itself in words or in words, what is actually done is only the stage of ""democratic and undemocratic"", which is also democratic and undemocratic. The true democratic constitutionalism has already passed in Taiwan. ""A long-awaited call"", the result is still ""only the stairs are ringing, no one is coming down.""
As far as the current social conditions are concerned, due to the improvement of the wisdom of the people, the prosperity of the economy and the progress of life, the natural logic of the outside party should be the route of choosing political reformers; but the current political system, especially the central political system. In terms of the lack of representativeness and the lack of legitimacy of the local political system, people outside the party should embark on the path of social movement. Therefore, today's non-party outsiders, like traditional outsiders, have the dual task of political reformers and social activists.
Due to the rigidity and inertia exposed by the established system, the non-party outsiders should not only talk too much about the role of political workers at this stage, but should also concentrate all forces and use all non-violent methods to make the impact of the new system in the new reality. Under, you can't make reasonable adjustments. If the Kuomintang is not able to face up to this urgent need, or deliberately ignore it, and to eliminate the reasonable pursuit of the outside party within the system, the Kuomintang will not be able to completely exclude the outside party from the Republic of China in the early years of the Republic of China. When Yuan Shikai was forced to persecute, he took the whole path to negate the path of the established system.
We sincerely hope that we can express our sincere and solemn hope to all our compatriots living in Taiwan at this moment of national unity: we should be the unfinished business left by the Chinese ancestors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the early 20th century. Responsible, and with practical actions and determined determination, I will do my best to do something that makes the ancestors and the children and grandchildren feel ""bad business.""
The two major issues of current politics (October 1979), the author is very rigorously demanding that the ruling Kuomintang authorities should courageously face the two major problems of the political system, that is:

The representativeness of the central political system.
The legitimacy of the local political system.

Over the years, criticism of the central government has focused on Congress because:

Representatives of the Congress are not representative.
Members of Congress lack competence.
The status quo in Congress hinders participation.

This is because the vast majority of Congressional representatives were elected in mainland China and Taiwan 30 years ago, and they constitute the main body of the Congress. They are not representative of the compatriots living in Taiwan. The ruling Kuomintang However, it is regarded as ""legal system"" and strongly opposed to public opinion.
According to the process and experience of democratic political growth, three points should also be emphasized:

The current Congress violates one of the most basic and popular principles of democratic politics - the tenure system.
The way in which current members of Congress are born is fundamentally incompatible with the experience of parliamentary political growth.
The current Congress violates the entire historical trend of thought and the world.

The most urgent reform of the central political system is the re-election of the National Assembly. The current situation is: the maintenance of the legal system lacks democracy; and the expansion of democracy will shake the legal system. Therefore, the full re-election of representatives of the Congress is the initial goal; the overall adjustment of the central organization and authority is the ultimate goal of reform.
As for the so-called local political system, in terms of the current situation, it refers to the political system of Taiwan Province. Its biggest flaw:

It makes the current local political system appear incomplete and becomes a lame local autonomy.
It shows that the ruling authorities lack confidence.
It shames the Chinese nation.

It is the second step of improving the local political system to formulate a unified provincial autonomy law and a municipal autonomy law to implement complete local autonomy; and then adjust the central and local powers and responsibilities and levels.
The current situation is: Without Taiwan, there would be no government of the Republic of China. The government of the Republic of China does not have today, and there is no tomorrow. When the Government of the Republic of China and Taiwan, in essence, have almost become two-in-one and have a common destiny, the government should have a deep understanding of the common demands and aspirations of all compatriots living in Taiwan for survival and development.
Throughout the book, this is just a political professional who presented his observations from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, hoping to help Taiwan, the Kuomintang, the non-party and the people of Taiwan. The text shows a great love of intellectuals to Taiwan. Unexpectedly, the Guard Headquarters deducted it from ""negating the law, smashing the law, confusing the voice, provoke the government and the people's feelings, and affecting the morale of the people."" Think about it, this is a ridiculous story.
The author introduces: Huang Huangxiong, born in 1944, Yilan, a master's degree from the National Taiwan University Institute of Political Science and Technology, served as a party committee and supervisory committee of the party and the Democratic Progressive Party. His works include ""Jiang Yushui Biography"", etc. In 2018, he served as the chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Transformation and Justice. Later, he resigned due to the social disputes caused by the ""East Factory"" by Zhang Tianqin, the deputy chairman.

A ban on official documents, a piece of Taiwan history from the ban on Taiwan's democratization process


""Regulations on the Control of Publications in the Period of Martial Law in Taiwan""

On December 10, 1979, the International Human Rights Day occurred in Kaohsiung's beautiful island incident (also known as the Kaohsiung incident), which had an important impact on the development of Taiwan's future political situation. The media's concern over the big trial made the Taiwanese people begin to care about politics after this incident. At the same time, the Administration has also stepped up its control to transfer the authority previously held by the Information Bureau to the Police Headquarters.
Since then, Taiwan’s ban on books has started from a printing factory to sales, all of which have been fighting with the police.
Most of the banned books selected by the author were escorted by the Guard Headquarters in violation of Article 3 of the ""Regulations on the Control of Publications in the Period of Stowe in Taiwan"" (the publications must not have one of the following paragraphs) (the anti-Communist countries), the sixth paragraph (Confused and invisible, enough to affect the morale of the people or harm the public security), the seventh paragraph (provocation of the government and people's emotional) to punish and punish.
This book introduces the hundreds of banned books that were banned at that time. It was more important. On September 24, 1980, I banned Lin Yixiong and Yao Jiawen’s ""Hua Ping Pingyang"" and Zhang Junhong's ""My Contemplation and Five books, such as Struggle, were discussed. By January 12, 1983, Cao Juren’s ""Lu Xun Biography"" was banned, a total of 27 books.

Nowadays, Taiwan, known as the freest Chinese publishing center and a variety of books and styles, can hardly imagine that publishing was a profession that was regarded as ""political"" and ""disappeared.""
Through this book, most of the names of authors who are familiar or unfamiliar are politically related, but also include the unexpected Jin Yong, ""The Legend of the Condor Heroes"", which is banned by the government. (Guo Jing and Huang Rong expressed shock)
Reading this book is like taking a trip to the history of Taiwan's post-war democracy movement. Those names and events have all affected Taiwan after the martial law. From Lin Yixiong to Chen Wencheng, the figures of the democratic predecessors have become the bricks of the road to democracy in different forms.
We remember that in the form of books that have been banned, destroyed, and arrested.
