      <p>Rajkot - The <b>Twenty20</b> format can be used to groom young talent and prepare them for one-dayers and Tests while not distracting players from winning games, stand-in India skipper <b>Rohit Sharma</b> said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sharma, who is captaining the side in the second T20 against Bangladesh in Rajkot on Thursday with Virat Kohli rested for the series, is leading a young Indian side with several veterans rested.</p>
      <p>The hosts need to win to keep the three-match series alive after going down in the opening game by seven wickets.</p>
      <p>"We want to try a lot of players to make them ready for the other formats," Sharma told a press conference.</p>
      <p>"Because this is the format where these individuals can come out and express themselves so that they are ready for ODI and Test cricket."</p>
      <p>Sharma has been one of India's brightest stars in limited-overs cricket, but also proved his mettle in the Test format after making a successful debut as opener in during his team's 3-0 sweep of South Africa.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed "hitman" for his attacking style of play, Sharma - who made his Test debut in 2013, six years after his first ODI match - scored 529 runs with two centuries and a double ton in the three matches.</p>
      <p>"We have seen a lot of players who have emerged from this format," Sharma said, adding players would learn valuable lessons even in defeat.</p>
      <p>"But having said that, winning games is the first priority," he said.</p>
      <p>Paceman Khaleel Ahmed and allrounder Shivam Dube - who made his debut in Delhi on Sunday - are just some of the players being trialled by the team's management with an eye on the T20 World Cup in Australia next year.</p>
      <p>Sharma, 32, said the hosts could adopt a "different" approach with the bat and ball in the second match if they get a good pitch.</p>
