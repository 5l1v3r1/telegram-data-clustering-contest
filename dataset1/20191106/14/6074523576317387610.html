      <h1>Kim Dotcom’s Planned Token Sale Is Off, Says Bitfinex</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T14:25:05+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author">William Foxley</a></address>
      <p>Bitfinex and a blockchain project launched by Kim Dotcom have “mutually agreed” to part ways, scuppering a planned initial exchange offering (IEO) for the controversial internet entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>Citing the current “regulatory environment” and the “risks associated with raising funds” for the project, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/430">Bitfinex said</a> in a blog post Wednesday that it was in the interest of its “community” not to host the sale of Dotcom’s kimcoin token.</p>
      <p>Dotcom was notably the founder of Megaupload, a file-sharing site <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204616504577171180266957116">shut down</a> in 2012 for violating piracy laws by the U.S. Department of Justice. He’s currently still in the process of appealing extradition to the United States from New Zealand where he resides.</p>
      <p>The K.im project is a blockchain-based content-monetization network, touted on its website as “providing a comprehensive suite of advanced services and technologies to manage, protect and sell every digital content.”</p>
      <p>The IEO model of fundraising <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-okex-and-kucoin-are-using-ieos-to-command-the-spotlight">emerged in 2019</a> and sees exchange platforms offering listing support and launch campaigns for new startup tokens. To date, Bitfinex <a href="https://tokensales.bitfinex.com/token-sales">has conducted</a> token sales for projects Dusk, Ampleforth and Ultra, among others.</p>
