She also posted a media report on Infosys terminating services of non-performing employees as part of its involuntary attrition.
""There is no news coming from anywhere of increase in employment rate or new jobs being created. Big corporates have started firing people. Those who say 'sab change si' are now 'chup si' (absolutely quiet).... Why?)"" the Congress general secretary said.
Prime Minister Modi, in his address at mega 'Howdy, Modi' event in September in US, said, ""If you ask me 'Howdy, Modi', my answer is: Everything is great in India.
