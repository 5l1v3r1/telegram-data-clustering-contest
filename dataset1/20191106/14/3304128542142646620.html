      <p>With many Kenyans decrying the safety of Safarilink and Silverstone airlines it has now emerged that the airport needs to be upgraded.</p>
      <p>A source intimated to this desk that Wilson is not fit for planes above 7 tonnes as it was designed for smaller planes.</p>
      <p>“There was a notam given by KCAA [Kenya Civil Aviation Authority] which stated that any plane above 7tonnes should not operate from Wilson, ” said the source who sought anonymity.</p>
      <p>“It means a Dash 8 100/200/300/400 , Fokker 50s, Embraer 120s can’t operate from Wilson.”</p>
      <p>Late last month, a Safarilink plane veered off the runway at Wilson Airport at around 6.25pm.</p>

      <p>The aircraft that was headed to Lamu crashed shortly after takeoff due to overloading and disregard to the safety regulations at the airport.</p>
