      <p><b>SHARON, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Massachusetts State Police say three men linked to a Rhode Island-based auto theft ring have been arrested after crashing vehicles while fleeing authorities.</p>
      <p>Officials say the arrests on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning occurred as troopers and local officers were investigating a series of thefts of cars, tires and rims in several communities south of Boston.</p>
      <p>Authorities say two vehicles crashed in Sharon, Massachusetts, after suspects fled approaching officers. Police say the officers did not pursue them.</p>
      <p>A third vehicle that fled in Sharon crashed on Interstate 95 in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Police are still searching for the driver.</p>
      <p>Police arrested three men in their 20s from Providence, Rhode Island - Kemoni Mitchell, Joshua Tangui and Marcos Torres. It's not clear if they have lawyers who could respond to the allegations.</p>
