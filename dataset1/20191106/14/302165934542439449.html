      <p>NEW DELHI, Nov 6 — Even with pollution cloaking northern India, visitors are still thronging the Taj Mahal, the shining marble mausoleum south of Delhi.</p>
      <p>Every year around eight million people — mostly domestic tourists — visit the monument, built by a 17th-century Mughal emperor for his wife.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, with smog levels many times maximum levels, only a few of the roughly 10,000 daily visitors wore pollution masks, and most of them were foreigners.</p>
      <p>Gildas Courtois, a French visitor, complained that he was coughing, his nose was running and that his eyes were sore.</p>
      <p>“We don’t feel comfortable with it,” he told AFP. “It makes it bitter. Makes the visit bitter, because it’s a wonder, one of the wonders of the world.”</p>
      <p>He had travelled to Agra from Delhi, the choking Indian megacity of 20 million people 250 kilometres (155 miles) to the north, where the air was “very, very bad”, he said.</p>
      <p>A Japanese tourist wearing a mask at the Taj Mahal felt the same way.</p>
      <p>“Breathing dirty air affects our health directly and instantly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am feeling chest congestion and my eyes are watery. We are using masks but I’m not sure how effective they are.”</p>
      <p>Every winter, smoke from thousands of farm fires combine with industrial and vehicle emissions to create a toxic mix that doctors say is taking years off Indians’ lives.</p>
      <p>For the Taj Mahal, a van with a large air purifier yesterday was parked up, but it was around 1.5 kilometres (one mile) away in a busy car park filled with diesel buses.</p>
      <p>“The van is deployed at locations where pollution levels are high to clean the air,” said Bhuvan Yadav, head of the local pollution control board.</p>
      <p>“But we don’t have empirical data whether it is effective in cleaning the air.”</p>
      <p>Most cities in north India, including New Delhi suffer from high levels of pollution around winter, when pollutants, dust and fog mix to form a thick blanket of smog.</p>
      <p>Last week New Delhi authorities declared a public health emergency after pollution levels skyrocketed, prompting the government to shut schools, ban construction and ration private cars on roads.</p>
      <p>India’s Supreme Court today questioned the government over its response to the crises, asking how it “permit people to die like this due to air pollution?” — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
