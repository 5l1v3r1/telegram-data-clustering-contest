（中央社記者劉世怡台北6日電）媒體人吳子嘉103年指稱，頂新魏家捐10億元政治獻金給前總統馬英九。台灣高等法院更一審今天認定吳子嘉未經查證，判須賠償新台幣160萬元，全案可上訴。
登報道歉部分，最高法院今年3月初判吳子嘉必須在蘋果、自由、美麗島等3電子報上刊登道歉聲明確定。
這起案件源於民國103年10月15日，吳子嘉在美麗島電子報上撰寫一篇標題為「吃頂新黑錢，馬英九準備坐牢？」文章，提及「馬團隊在總統競選期間，曾收了頂新魏家逾10億的政治獻金」、「吃頂新黑心錢的馬團隊，恐怕要做好坐牢的準備。」遭馬英九求償。
一審台北地方法院調閱特偵組簽結馬英九被告發涉嫌違法收受頂新集團政治獻金案的資料，發現馬英九並無具體犯罪事證，另調查吳子嘉提供的新聞報導等資料，認為可信度甚為薄弱。
一審認為，吳子嘉未經查證，就在美麗島電子報發表這篇言論，供不特定多數人閱覽、轉載，導致馬英九名譽嚴重受損，審酌兩造身分、地位，馬英九求償300萬元過高，應減為180萬元較為適當；二審也判決維持180萬元賠償金額。
經上訴，最高法院今年3月認為，一審認定吳子嘉故意侵害馬英九名譽而判賠180萬元，二審改認定吳子嘉是重大過失，兩者程度有別，但金額相同，二審未清楚說明理由，因此發回台灣高等法院更審。
高院更一審合議庭認定，吳子嘉為重大過失，今天判他須賠160萬元，全案還可上訴。（編輯：方沛清）1081106

Refers to Ma Ying-jeou’s acceptance of Wei’s 1 billion, and even trial of Wu Zijia’s compensation of 1.6 million yuan.

(Central News Agency reporter Liu Shiyi, Taipei, 6th) The media person Wu Zijia claimed in 103 that the top Wei family donated 1 billion yuan in political donations to former president Ma Ying-jeou. The first instance of the Taiwan High Court today found that Wu Zijia had not been verified and was ordered to pay NT$1.6 million. The case can be appealed.
In the report of the apology, the Supreme Court ruled in early March that Wu Zijia must publish an apology statement on Apple, Freedom, and Beauty Island.
This case originated from the October 15th, Republic of China. On the 15th of October, Wu Zijia wrote an article entitled ""Eating a new black money, Ma Ying-jeou is ready to go to jail?"" in the Meidao Electronic News, mentioning that the horse team had received during the presidential campaign. ""The new Wei family has more than 1 billion political contributions."" ""The horse team that eats the new black-hearted money, I am afraid to be ready to go to jail."" Ma Ying-jeou claimed.
The first-instance Taipei District Court interviewed the special investigation team to sign the report that Ma Ying-jeou was accused of illegally accepting the political contribution of the Dingxin Group. He found that Ma Ying-jeou had no specific criminal evidence, and also investigated the news reports and other information provided by Wu Zijia, and believed that the credibility Very weak.
The first trial held that Wu Zijia did not verify this and published this remark in the Meidao Electronic Newsletter, which was read and reproduced by the unspecified majority. As a result, Ma Ying-jeou’s reputation was seriously damaged, and his status and status were considered. Ma Ying-jeou’s claim was over $3 million. It should be reduced to 1.8 million yuan; the second instance also decided to maintain a compensation amount of 1.8 million yuan.
Upon appeal, the Supreme Court held in March this year that the first trial found that Wu Zijia deliberately infringed Ma Ying-jeou’s reputation and awarded 1.8 million yuan. The second trial found that Wu Zijia was a gross negligence. The extent of the two was different, but the amount was the same. The second trial did not clearly explain the reasons. Go back to the Taiwan High Court for a more trial.
The High Court and the first-instance collegial panel found that Wu Zijia was a gross negligence. Today he was sentenced to pay 1.6 million yuan. The case can also be appealed. (Editor: Fang Peiqing) 1081106
