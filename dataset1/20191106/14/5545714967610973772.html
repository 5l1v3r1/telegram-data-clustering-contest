      <p>In my imagination, <i>Deep Down</i> was an incredible dungeon-crawling RPG from Capcom.</p>
      <p>It came out on PlayStation 4 as originally intended, we all played it, we all loved it, the public discourse shifted a few months later to suddenly deem it "overrated," and now we're dying for a sequel.</p>
      <p>In reality, <i>Deep Down </i>is little more than a pipe dream at this point.</p>

      <p>The game had a head-turning trailer in 2013 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../capcom-debuts-a-new-engine-and-new-ps4-game-deep-down--246156.phtml">during the PS4 reveal event</a>, and since then, <i>nothing</i>. Well, close to nothing. Capcom brought a build of <i>Deep Down </i>to Tokyo Game Show. Humans played it!</p>

      <p>Even looking back on this footage now, in 2019, I very much would've liked to experience this game. Also – and this is truly wild to me – <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deep-down-ps4/">the PlayStation.com landing page</a> for <i>Deep Down </i>exists to this day.</p>
      <p>As pointed out this week in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-06-what-does-the-future-hold-for-street-fighter-5">Eurogamer</a> interview with Capcom's Yoshinori Ono, there's still the slightest glimmer of hope for <i>Deep Down</i>. It could, one day, materialize into something new.</p>
      <p>"The original team is clearly no longer together at this point, but people might have noticed that we've kept the trademark registered, and it's not been completely given up on," Ono explained.</p>
      <p>"Every year we examine titles we're doing in future, and we bring up projects to approve and move forward," he told the outlet. "There's not much I can say about it, but if you've noticed we've kept the [<i>Deep Down</i>] trademark it means we haven't given up on the title completely."</p>
      <p>Honestly? It's probably for the best that <i>Deep Down </i>didn't come to fruition. I want to see the current Capcom – the Capcom that brought us <i>Resident Evil 7</i>, <i>Devil May Cry 5</i>, <i>Monster Hunter: World</i>, and the <i>RE2 </i>remake – take a stab at redefining <i>Deep Down </i>for (once again!) next-generation consoles.</p>
      <p>There's room in their lineup for a new IP, and they could absolutely pull it off.</p>
