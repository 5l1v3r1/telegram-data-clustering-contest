Swing voters refuse to rule out voting for Trump if he shot someone
06 Nov 2019, 14:53 by Mike Brest
Some members of a panel of Pennsylvania swing voters on CNN refused to rule out voting for President Trump even if he shot someone.
The question and answer segment, which was led by Alisyn Camerota, aired on Wednesday morning. At the end of the interview, Camerota asked Crystal, who appeared to be the most pro-Trump of the group, if there's anything Trump ""can do that would make you not vote for him?""
Crystal replied by saying there was nothing the president could do that would stop her from voting for him.
Camerota then brought up the president's own claim — that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue without fear of repercussions — and asked if she'd vote for him in that hypothetical scenario.
A different panelist interjected: “You’d have to know why he shot him.”
Crystal agreed, saying, “Yeah, why did he shoot him?”
Earlier in the interview, four of the six women agreed that the Democrats' impeachment investigation into Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will hurt everyone because ""when you splash mud, it hits everyone.""
