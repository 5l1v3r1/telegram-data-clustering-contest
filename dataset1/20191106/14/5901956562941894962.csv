Ženska je bila tik pred porodom, zato so poklicali reševalce. A deklica nanje ni želela počakati in je na svet prijokala kar v gozdu.Mater in novorojenko, ki so ji na svet pomagali policisti, so po porodu z rešilcem prepeljali v bolnišnico v Sisek. Očeta so namestili v center za prosilce za azil v Zagrebu, potem ko je izkazal namen, da bo z družino za azil zaprosil na Hrvaškem.

Croatian police assisted her.
06 Nov 2019, 14:22 by STA, Ma. M.
GLINA - Croatian police arrested spouses from Iraq on Tuesday afternoon in a forest in the Clay area along the BiH border, suspected of illegally entering Croatia. The woman was just before giving birth, so they called an ambulance. But the girl did not want to wait for them and she cried out in the woods. The mother and the newborn baby, who were assisted by police officers, were transported to the hospital in Sisek after delivery with the ambulance. The father was placed in an asylum seeker center in Zagreb after he had stated his intention to seek asylum with his family in Croatia.
