我們想讓你知道的是採納複雜性理論似乎可以讓我們同時運用災難論和體制崩壞，構成一個最佳的解釋取徑，說明公元前一二○○年之後愛琴海和地中海東部地區青銅時代終結的原因。



文：艾瑞克・克萊恩（Eric H. Cline）
第五章：一場「完美風暴」的大災難？
（前略）
總評各種可能因素與複雜理論
本章開宗明義便提到，所謂的青銅時代晚期終結式的崩壞或大災難，學者早已進行多方探討。羅伯・德魯斯嘗試系統性地處理這個問題，他在一九九三年的著作中，逐章一一探討不同的潛在因素；然而，他或許誤判並低估了當中某些因素，舉例來說，他從一開始便不考慮體制崩壞的，並認為真正的原因是戰爭形態改變，然而並非所有學者都贊成他的假設。
德魯斯的作品問世也已二十年，各方學者依然持續爭論，相關學術著作的出版也從未間斷，在青銅時代即將面臨終結的幽暗微光中，是何人或什麼原因造成各文明的各大城市被毀或被棄，至今依然未能達成共識。這個問題可簡要概括如下：
主要觀點
一、我們知道，公元前十五至前十三世紀，愛琴海和地中海東部地區存在許多繁榮昌盛的不同文明，從邁錫尼人、邁諾安人到西臺人、埃及人、巴比倫人、亞述人、迦南人和賽普勒斯人。這些文明各自獨立但持續互動，尤其是透過國際貿易路線。
二、顯然有眾多城市被毀，此外，愛琴海、地中海東部、埃及和近東地區的各個青銅時代晚期文明，及其居民原本熟悉的生活方式，都在大約公元前一一七七年或稍晚終結。
三、沒有人能提供這場災難的確切證據，無法證明是誰或何種原因造成各文明崩壞與青銅時代晚期終結。
各種可能因素討論
直接或間接導致青銅時代晚期最終崩壞的原因或許很多，但單憑其中一者似乎都不可能釀成這場災難。
一、顯然這個時期發生過多次地震，但通常各個社會事後都可以恢復元氣。
二、古代文獻及現代科技均足以證明，愛琴海和地中海地區曾發生饑荒、乾旱與氣候變遷，但要再次強調的是，各個社會還是有時仍能，恢復元氣。
三、或許有間接證據表明，包括黎凡特在內的希臘與其他地區曾爆發內亂，儘管到目前為止這未獲得證實。再次強調，各個社會往往可以熬過這些內亂。此外，廣泛而長期的內亂，其實並不常見（儘管與現代中東地區的近年局勢正相反）。
四、在黎凡特這個地帶，北至烏加里特、南至拉吉，都有考古證據可證明有入侵者的痕跡，這些人可能是來自愛琴海地區、安納托利亞西部、賽普勒斯任一地區或全數地區的新移民。有些城市被毀之後遭到遺棄，有些則在被毀後又有人重新居住，還有另外一些則未受影響。
五、顯然國際貿易路線會受到影響，或為局部性，或可能完全中斷，至於這對各文明造成的衝擊究竟多大，至今未能有明確答案，即便那些過度依賴進口商品的文明——如前文曾探討的邁錫尼人——情況亦是如此。
確實，文明若遭逢外族入侵、地震、乾旱或內亂，難免有無法復原或支撐的時候。但就當時情形來看，在缺乏更適宜的解釋之下，最好的解決辦法就是：主張這些因素共同導致青銅時代晚期各地區王國和社會崩壞。因此，根據目前找得到的證據，我們或許可以看到，體制崩壞是源於一系列事件串連起來，引發了「加乘效應」，一個因素影響到其他因素，環環相扣下強化了每個因素的影響力。
也許那些居民逃得過單一災難，好比某場地震或某次乾旱，但是地震、乾旱和入侵者接連而來，令人猝不及防，多種災難交互影響下，居民可能無法倖存。災禍仍頻，隨之而來的是「骨牌效應」，一個文明瓦解將導致其他文明接連步上後塵。鑑於當時這裡的世界已具有全球化性質，即使只有一個社會崩壞，對國際貿易路線和經濟的影響足以為其他社會帶來毀滅。若這是當時的真實情況，各文明的規模還沒有大到足以抵擋沒落的趨勢。
然而，暫且不論我上述的評論，僅以體制崩壞概括解釋青銅時代晚期愛琴海、地中海東部和近東地區的終結，或許太過簡單。我們可能必須訴諸於所謂的「複雜性科學」——或者稱為「複雜性理論」（complexity theory）更準確，說不定多少能夠找出這些文明崩壞的因素。
複雜性科學或理論是研究一個或多個複雜系統時，用以解釋「一連串目標相互影響之下出現的現象」。這個理論被廣泛用於解釋或解決各種問題，例如交通阻塞、股市崩盤、癌症等疾病、環境變遷，甚至是戰爭等等，牛津大學的尼爾・詹森（Neil Johnson）近年便曾在著作中進行相關討論。數十年來，它已跳脫原先的數學和計算學，跨入國際關係、商業與其他眾多領域，只是一直以來極少被用在考古領域。有趣的是，或可以說具有先見之明的是，卡羅・貝爾早在二○○六年的著作中便簡單探討過這個議題，她的書主要討論黎凡特從青銅時代晚期到鐵器時代長途貿易關係的演變，她指出，複雜性理論是一種充滿希望的理論研究法，或許可以用來解釋那場崩壞與重建的因素。
詹森認為，若要以複雜理論做為某個問題的研究方法，問題必須涉及「包含一組有許多相互影響的目標或媒介」的系統。在本例中，這些目標就是活躍於青銅時代晚期的各個文明，包括邁錫尼人、邁諾安人、西臺人、埃及人、迦南人和賽普勒斯人等等。就複雜性理論其中一個層面來看，人們的行為會受到其記憶與對過往經歷的「反應」（feedback）之影響，他們有能力修改對策，部分是根據他們對歷史的了解。舉例說明，汽車駕駛通常很熟悉住家周邊的交通形態，有能力預測上班或回家的最快路線，遇到塞車時，他們找得到解決問題的替代路線。同樣的，在青銅時代晚期終了之際，從烏加里特或其他地方走海路的商人可能會採取相應措施，以迴避敵船或強盜經常出沒的某些區域——包括盧卡的沿海地區（後來被稱為「呂基亞」，位於安納托利亞西南部）。
詹森也表示，這種系統一般來說是「活的」，也就是它以重要而往往複雜的方式演化，同時它也是「開放的」，這表示它會受到周圍環境影響。一如詹森所說，現今的分析師每每談到複雜的股市，宛如把它當成活生生又會呼吸的有機體，某特定公司盈利的外部消息或是世界另一端發生某個事件，都會影響或驅動這個有機體。席拉特十年前出版過相關著作，並在序言中引用上述觀點，她描述青銅時代晚期的世界與現今世界相似之處，雙邊的「全球經濟和文化愈來愈相似也愈來愈難以控制，在這當中……世界一端的政治動盪將劇烈影響幾千哩外眾多區域的經濟」。青銅時代晚期終結之際，愛琴海和地中海東部地區的「系統」所受到的影響或壓力，或許就是前面提到的那些、可能發生過與可以想見的地震、饑荒、乾旱、氣候變遷、內亂、外族入侵以及貿易路線中斷。
我們可能會認為，最重要的前提是詹森的主張：這種系統會出現一種「通常令人訝異，也許相當極端」的現象。他還說，這「基本上代表任何事都可能發生——只要你等得夠久，它通常就會發生」；舉例來說，他指出，所有股市最後都會出現某種崩盤，所有交通系統最後都會出現某種壅塞。而這些狀況發生時，通常都在意料之外，無法事先預知，哪怕有人非常清楚它們可能且應當發生。
在我們的案例中，世界史上從未有任何文明能逃過崩壞的下場，而既然崩壞原因往往類似，一如賈德・戴蒙與許多學者的看法，青銅時代晚期文明最後邁向崩壞一事其實可以預料到，但就算我們完全了解各文明，也不可能預知崩壞何時會發生，或者各文明會不會同時崩壞。詹森曾寫道：「即使充分掌握一輛車的引擎、顏色和外形等等規格，但面對全新道路系統時，依然無助於我們預知何處及何時會塞車。同理可證，在擁擠的酒吧中，即使徹底了解每個人的個性，也無助於預測會發生多大規模的鬥毆事件。」
既然複雜性理論無法幫助我們預測青銅時代晚期崩壞的時間與原因，那它還有什麼用處呢？卡羅・貝爾指出，愛琴海和地中海東部地區的貿易網可做為複雜體系的範例，因此，她引述雷丁大學（University of Reading）的肯・達克（Ken Dark）所做的研究，達克曾經表示：「隨著這種體系愈來愈複雜，以及組成分子之間愈來愈需要互相依賴，想要維持整個體系的穩定就會變得難上加難。」這種情況被稱為「高度凝聚」（hyper-coherence），如達克所說，「當體系中每個組成分子高度互相依賴，任何個體的變化都會導致整體不穩定」，這便是高度凝聚。因此，如果青銅時代晚期各文明確實已經全球化，並在商品和服務互相依賴，那麼若邁錫尼或西臺任一王國出現變化，即使程度不大，這依然可能對諸王國造成潛在的影響甚至動盪。
再者，青銅時代晚期愛琴海和地中海東部各王國、帝國和社會都可視為個別的社會政治體系，高度凝聚理論特別適用於這種情況。如達克所說，這種「複雜的社會政治體系內部不斷變化，因而增加體系的複雜性……體系愈複雜則崩壞的可能性就愈大」。
因此，在青銅時代晚期愛琴海和地中海東部地區，我們可以看到個別的社會政治體系、不同的文明，它們愈來愈複雜，顯然也就更容易崩壞。同時，我們也看到複雜的各種體系——也就是貿易網絡，各網絡互相依賴而且關係複雜，因此，一旦某個組成分子發生變化，整個網絡就可能陷入不穩定。好比一部保養完善的機器中有個齒輪故障，那麼整個裝置可能馬上淪為一堆廢鐵，又好比現今的汽車，就算只有一根推桿脫落，引擎也立刻報廢。
因此，與其將青銅時代晚期的終結視為一種啟示錄般的末日（儘管或許有些城市和王國真的遭逢大火戲劇性地終結，比如烏加里特），不如把它想成一種混亂的局勢，那些逐漸瓦解的區域和城市原本具有重要地位，而且彼此之間密切往來，如今已式微並陷入孤立，邁錫尼便是一例，因為內部和／或外部變化影響了複雜體系中一個或多個組成分子，顯然這種破壞會中斷整體網絡。不妨設想一下，若是現代電網遭到暴風雨或地震侵襲而中斷，電力公司雖然能夠發電，但無法將電力輸送給個別的消費者，美國每年都會發生這種情況，從奧克拉荷馬州的龍捲風到麻薩諸塞州的暴風雪，任何情形都有可能導致電力輸送中斷。如果重大災難導致永久中斷，比如現今的核電廠發生爆炸，那就連發電都會有問題。這種比喻或許也可以套用在青銅時代晚期，只不過當時的技術水準較低。
此外，貝爾還指出，不穩定會產生一種後果：當複雜性體系崩壞，它會「分解成更小的個體」，這正是青銅時代文明邁入鐵器時代的情形。因此，採納複雜性理論似乎可以讓我們同時運用災難論和體制崩壞，構成一個最佳的解釋取徑，說明公元前一二○○年之後愛琴海和地中海東部地區青銅時代終結的原因。真正的癥結點並不在於「是誰幹的」或者「什麼事件引發的」，畢竟這牽扯太多因素和對象，問題在於「為什麼會發生」以及「如何發生」，至於崩壞結局是否能夠避免，這完全是另一個問題。
然而，用複雜性理論來分析青銅時代晚期的崩壞因素，我們或許只是用某個科學（甚至可能是偽科學）術語來彌補因資訊不足而無法歸納結論的情況。這聽起來很棒，但這樣做真的能讓我們更加理解整件事嗎？這該不會只是用比較花俏的方式陳述顯而易見的事實——即複雜的事物本來就會以各種不同方式分崩離析。
毫無疑問，青銅時代晚期文明崩壞的起因相當複雜。我們確實知道有許多可能變因在這場崩壞中發揮作用，但是我們甚至不清楚是否已經找出所有變因，而我們也肯定也不知道哪些變因最為關鍵，而哪些變因只對某個區域很重要，但對整體其實影響不大。不妨以現今的塞車現象進一步比喻：我們都知道塞車大多是由哪些變因造成，對於車流量和沿途情況（道路寬或窄），我們心裡有數，因此自然能夠預測某些外部變因造成的影響，好比在高速公路遇到暴風雪。然而，我們可以猜測，青銅時代晚期和現今的交通系統相比，前者的變因恐怕多出了數百個。
此外，青銅時代各文明日益複雜因而愈加具有崩壞傾向，這種說法其實沒有那麼合理，特別是當我們將其「複雜程度」與近三百年歐洲文明相比。因此，唯有我們掌握更多相關文明的細節，複雜性理論或許才能在研究青銅時代晚期崩壞時派上用場，於現階段恐怕效用不大，除非將它當成一種有趣的方法來，重新架構我們對這場崩壞的認知：青銅時代晚期終結時有惡化不穩定的因素，最後導致國際體系崩壞，儘管這個體系在數百年來、於各個層面都運作良好。
但是，依然持續有學術著作主張：青銅時代晚期的是呈「直線形態」發展，「乾旱造成饑荒，饑荒再造成海上民族遷徙及製造混亂，最後導致各文明崩壞」，但這個說法並不符合事實。此進程並非呈直線形態，真實情況應該更加混亂。或許從來就沒有單一驅動力或導火線，而是許多不同的刺激，逼迫人們做出各種反應，以便適應不斷變化的情況。當我們構想「非直線型」進程及一系列刺激而非單一驅力時，複雜性理論會特別適用，因此在解釋青銅時代晚期終結的崩壞上，複雜性理論具有很大的優勢。而要繼續研究這場災難，它也不失為一道良方。

""The Key to the Fall of Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations"": Why can the ""maritime nation"" successively destroy the four ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Western Taiwan, and Babylon?
06 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that adopting complexity theory seems to allow us to use both disaster theory and institutional collapse to form a best explanation for the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean after 1200 BC. The reason for the end.



Text: Eric H. Cline
Chapter 5: A catastrophe of a ""perfect storm""?
(previously omitted)
General comment on various possible factors and complex theories
The opening of this chapter clearly mentions that the so-called collapse of the late Bronze Age or the catastrophe, scholars have long been engaged in many discussions. Robert Drews tried to deal with this problem systematically. In his 1993 book, he explored different potential factors step by step. However, he may misjudge and underestimate some of the factors, for example. He said that he did not consider the collapse of the system from the beginning, and believed that the real reason was the change in the form of war. However, not all scholars agree with his assumptions.
The works of Drews have been published for 20 years, and scholars from all walks of life continue to argue. The publication of related academic works has never stopped. In the dark glimmer that is about to end in the Bronze Age, who or what causes the civilization? Major cities have been destroyed or abandoned, and still have not reached a consensus. This issue can be summarized as follows:
The main points
1. We know that from the fifteenth to the thirteenth centuries BC, there were many prosperous civilizations in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean, from the Mycenae, the Minorians to the Westerners, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, Assyrians, Canaanites, and Cypresses. These civilizations are independent but continue to interact, especially through international trade routes.
Second, it is clear that many cities have been destroyed. In addition, the late Bronze Age civilizations of the Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, Egypt and the Near East, and the lifestyles familiar to their inhabitants, were around 1177 BC or later. End.
3. No one can provide definitive evidence of this disaster. It is impossible to prove who or what caused the collapse of civilizations and the end of the late Bronze Age.
Various possible factors discussion
There may be many reasons for the ultimate collapse of the late Bronze Age, directly or indirectly, but it seems that one of them alone is unlikely to lead to this disaster.
First, it is obvious that there have been many earthquakes during this period, but usually every society can recover afterwards.
Second, ancient literature and modern science and technology are sufficient to prove that famine, drought and climate change have occurred in the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean region, but it is necessary to emphasize again that various societies are still able to recover.
Third, there may be circumstantial evidence that civil strife has erupted in Greece and other regions, including Levant, although this has not been confirmed so far. Once again, it is often said that societies can often survive these civil strife. In addition, widespread and long-term civil strife is not common (although contrary to the recent situation in the modern Middle East).
4. In the area of Levant, north to Ugarit and south to Raj, there are archaeological evidences of traces of invaders, possibly from the Aegean region, western Anatolia, and Cypress. New immigrants from any region or region. Some cities were abandoned after being destroyed, others were re-inhabited after being destroyed, and others were unaffected.
5. It is obvious that the international trade route will be affected, either locally or possibly completely interrupted. As for the impact on the civilizations, there is no clear answer so far, even those that are over-reliant on imported goods - as in the previous article. The Mycenae who had been explored - the same is true.
Indeed, if civilization is invaded by foreigners, earthquakes, droughts or civil strife, it will inevitably be impossible to restore or support. However, as far as the situation is concerned, in the absence of a more appropriate explanation, the best solution is to argue that these factors together led to the collapse of the kingdoms and societies of various regions in the late Bronze Age. Therefore, based on the evidence we have found so far, we may see that the collapse of the system stems from a series of incidents that have led to a “plus-multiple effect”. One factor affects other factors, and the interlocking has strengthened. The influence of each factor.
Perhaps those residents have escaped a single disaster, like an earthquake or a drought, but earthquakes, droughts and intruders have come one after another, and it is unpredictable that residents may not survive under the influence of multiple disasters. The scourge is still frequent, and the ""bone card effect"" comes with it. A civilized disintegration will lead other civilizations to follow in the footsteps. Given that the world at the time was global in nature, even if only one society collapsed, the impact on international trade routes and the economy was enough to bring destruction to other societies. If this is the real situation at the time, the scale of each civilization is not large enough to withstand the trend of decline.
However, for the time being, regardless of my comments above, it is probably too simple to explain the end of the Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East in the late Bronze Age. We may have to resort to the so-called ""complexity science"" - or ""complexity theory"" to be more accurate, and perhaps some can find out the factors that collapsed these civilizations.
Complexity science or theory is the study of one or more complex systems to explain ""a phenomenon that occurs under the influence of a series of targets."" This theory is widely used to explain or solve various problems, such as traffic congestion, stock market crashes, cancer and other diseases, environmental changes, and even wars. Neil Johnson of Oxford University has been writing in recent years. Conduct relevant discussions. For decades, it has escaped from the original mathematics and computational sciences, and has entered international relations, business, and many other fields, but has rarely been used in archaeological fields. Interestingly, or presumably, Carlo Bell has briefly discussed this topic in his 2006 book. Her book focuses on Levant's long-distance trade from the late Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The evolution of the relationship, she pointed out that the theory of complexity is a promising theoretical research method that may be used to explain the factors of collapse and reconstruction.
Jensen believes that if complex theory is to be used as a research method for a problem, the problem must involve a system that contains ""a set of targets or vectors with many interactions."" In this case, these goals are active in the various civilizations of the late Bronze Age, including the Mycenae, the Minorians, the Westerners, the Egyptians, the Canaanites, and the Cypresses. At one level of complexity theory, people's behavior is influenced by their memories and ""feedbacks"" of past experiences. They have the ability to modify countermeasures, in part based on their understanding of history. For example, car driving is usually familiar with the traffic patterns around the home, and has the ability to predict the fastest route to work or go home. When they encounter a traffic jam, they find an alternative route to solve the problem. Similarly, at the end of the late Bronze Age, merchants who took the sea from Ugarit or elsewhere may take steps to evade certain areas where enemy ships or robbers are often seen – including the coastal areas of Lucca (later Known as ""Lucia"", located in the southwestern part of Anatolia.
Jensen also said that such a system is generally ""living"", that is, it evolves in an important and often complex way, and it is also ""open"", which means it will be affected by the surrounding environment. As Jensen said, today's analysts often talk about complex stock markets as if they are living and breathing organisms, external news of a particular company's profit or an event happening on the other side of the world will affect or drive This organism. She has published relevant works ten years ago and quoted the above points in the preface. She describes the similarities between the late Bronze Age and the present world. The bilateral “global economy and culture are becoming more and more similar and more difficult to control. In this... the political turmoil at one end of the world will dramatically affect the economies of many regions, thousands of miles away."" At the end of the late Bronze Age, the influence or pressure on the ""system"" of the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean may be the aforementioned earthquakes, famines, droughts, climate changes, civil strife that may have occurred and can be imagined. The invasion of foreigners and the interruption of trade routes.
We may think that the most important premise is Jensen's claim that there will be a phenomenon that is ""usually surprising, perhaps quite extreme"". He also said that this ""basically means that anything can happen - as long as you wait long enough, it usually happens""; for example, he pointed out that all stock markets will eventually have some kind of collapse, all traffic systems finally There will be some kind of congestion. When these conditions occur, they are usually unexpected and cannot be predicted in advance, even if someone knows very well that they may and should happen.
In our case, there has never been any civilization in the history of the world that has escaped the collapse of the collapse, and since the cause of the collapse is often similar, as Jade Dimon and many scholars have said, the late Bronze Age civilization finally collapsed. The bad thing can be expected, but even if we fully understand the civilizations, it is impossible to predict when the collapse will occur, or whether the civilizations will collapse at the same time. Jensen once wrote: ""Even if you fully grasp the specifications of a car's engine, color and shape, but in the face of a new road system, it still does not help us to predict where and when traffic jams. Similarly, it can be proved that it is crowded. In the bar, even a thorough understanding of each individual's personality does not help predict the number of big-scale fighting events.""
Since the theory of complexity cannot help us predict the time and cause of the collapse of the late Bronze Age, what is the use of it? Carlo Bell pointed out that the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean trade network can serve as an example of a complex system, so she quoted a study by Ken Dark of the University of Reading. Ke once said: ""As this system becomes more and more complex, and the more and more components need to depend on each other, it will become more difficult to maintain the stability of the whole system."" This situation is called ""Hyper-coherence,"" as Dak said, ""When each component of the system is highly interdependent, any individual change will lead to overall instability,"" which is highly agglomerated. Therefore, if the civilizations of the late Bronze Age were indeed globalized and dependent on goods and services, then if any of the kingdoms of Mycenae or Western Taiwan changed, even if the degree was not large, it could still have a potential impact on the kingdoms. Even turbulent.
Furthermore, the Aegean Sea in the late Bronze Age and the kingdoms, empires and societies of the Eastern Mediterranean can be regarded as individual socio-political systems, and the theory of high cohesion is particularly applicable to this situation. As Dak said, this ""complex social and political system is constantly changing, thus increasing the complexity of the system... The more complex the system, the more likely it is to collapse.""
Therefore, in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean in the late Bronze Age, we can see individual socio-political systems and different civilizations. They are becoming more and more complex and obviously more likely to collapse. At the same time, we also see complex systems—that is, trade networks—where networks are interdependent and complex, so that once a constituent molecule changes, the entire network can become unstable. For example, if there is a gear failure in a well-maintained machine, the whole device may immediately become a pile of scrap iron, and like today's car, even if only one putter falls off, the engine is immediately scrapped.
Therefore, instead of treating the end of the late Bronze Age as an apocalyptic doom (although perhaps some cities and kingdoms are really dramatically ended in a fire, such as Ugarit), it is better to think of it as a chaotic situation, and gradually Disintegrated regions and cities were originally important and closely related to each other and are now isolated and isolated. Mycenae is an example because internal and/or external changes affect one or more constituent molecules in a complex system. Obviously this disruption will disrupt the overall network. Imagine that if the modern power grid is interrupted by storms or earthquakes, power companies can generate electricity but cannot deliver electricity to individual consumers. This happens every year in the United States, from tornadoes in Oklahoma. A blizzard in Massachusetts can cause any disruption in power delivery. If a major disaster causes a permanent outage, such as an explosion at a nuclear power plant today, then even power generation can be problematic. This metaphor may also be applied in the late Bronze Age, but at the time the technical level was lower.
In addition, Bell also pointed out that instability has a consequence: when the complexity system collapses, it will ""decompose into smaller individuals,"" which is the case when the Bronze Age civilization entered the Iron Age. Therefore, the adoption of complexity theory seems to allow us to use both disaster theory and institutional collapse to form a best explanation for the reasons for the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean after 1200 BC. The real crux is not ""who did it"" or ""what happened."" After all, this involves too many factors and objects. The question is ""why will happen"" and ""how to happen"". As to whether the collapse can be avoided This is completely another problem.
However, using complexity theory to analyze the collapse factors in the late Bronze Age, we may just use some scientific (and possibly pseudo-science) terminology to compensate for the inability to summarize conclusions due to insufficient information. This sounds great, but does this really make us understand the whole thing more? It's not just to tell the obvious facts in a more fancy way—that complex things would have fallen apart in a variety of ways.
There is no doubt that the causes of the collapse of the late Bronze Age civilization were quite complicated. We do know that there are many possible causes that play a role in this collapse, but we don’t even know if we have identified all the causes, and we certainly don’t know which ones are the most critical, and which ones are only The area is important, but it has little effect on the whole. It is better to use the current traffic jam phenomenon as a metaphor: we all know which traffic jams are caused by the majority of traffic changes. For the traffic flow and the situation along the road (wide or narrow roads), we have a lot of thoughts, so we can naturally predict the impact of some external causes. It is like a snowstorm on the highway. However, we can guess that in the late Bronze Age, compared with the current transportation system, the former may have hundreds of changes.
In addition, the civilizations of the Bronze Age have become increasingly complex and thus have a tendency to collapse. This is actually not so reasonable, especially when we compare its ""complexity"" with the European civilization of nearly three hundred years. Therefore, only if we master more details about the relevant civilization, the theory of complexity may come in handy when studying the collapse of the late Bronze Age. At this stage, I am afraid that it will not be useful, unless it is regarded as an interesting method to re- Structure our perception of this collapse: the end of the late Bronze era, which deteriorated and unstable, and finally led to the collapse of the international system, even though it has worked well for centuries and at all levels.
However, there are still academic works that continue to be advocated: in the late Bronze Age, it was a ""straight line"" development, ""the drought caused famine, and the famine caused the maritime nation to migrate and create chaos, which eventually led to the collapse of civilizations."" fact. This process is not in a straight line, and the real situation should be more confusing. There may never be a single driving force or a fuse, but many different stimuli that force people to react in response to changing conditions. Complexity theory is particularly applicable when we conceive of a ""non-linear"" process and a series of stimuli rather than a single drive, so complexity theory has great advantages in explaining the collapse of the late Bronze Age. And to continue to study this disaster, it is also a good way.

In the second millennium BC, the ""global era"" that has never been seen before is very similar to the 21st century science and technology civilization! Why is the highly developed Mediterranean world collapsed overnight? Will the 21st century usher in the next crisis of civilization collapse?
In 1177 BC, the ""marine nation"" swept the world with lightning speed, attacking Egypt in one fell swoop, leaving death and destruction. Not only is Egypt unable to resist, but also the prosperous Mediterranean ancient civilizations of Greece, the West, the Babylon and other places, which have collapsed in just a few decades.
What is the key to the fall of the ancient Mediterranean civilization? The famous archaeologist Klein used the form of a five-act play to climb the history of the late Bronze Age, combining the complex aspects of trade, climate change, culture and economy, and he once again experienced this crucial journey!

This book flips the history of the past, uses modern science to strip the shackles and restore the historical truth.
The world's first history of the mysterious ""The Sea Peoples"" of the millennium history is deeply explored!
It is good at archaeological excavation, highly restored historical events of 3,000 years ago, and how its development affects modern civilization!


The reason for the fall of the ancient Mediterranean civilization in the late Bronze Age is actually the ""high internationalization""?

In the late Bronze Age three thousand years ago, the countries of the ancient Mediterranean experienced frequent trade, economic and cultural exchanges, like the contemporary world of the 21st century internationalization trend. But after nearly 300 years of prosperity, the Mediterranean world that gave birth to ancient civilizations collapsed overnight!
Is it a natural disaster or a man-made disaster that has led to the collapse of the internationalization system? The ancient world in Klein's writings is like a modern country in any historical record, with the characteristics of globalization and cosmopolitanism.
In 1177 BC and the mysterious ""marine nation"" to understand the key to the fall of ancient civilization, you need to understand the key historical moment of 1177 BC. The decline of the Roman Empire and the late Bronze Age civilization was two important turning points in history. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Islamic forces rose; and the rise and fall of the late Bronze Age also revealed that the classical Greek period was about to unfold.
In the late Bronze Age, is it similar to the world of science and technology civilization in the 21st century? Diplomats and economic trade embargoes, kidnappings and payment of ransoms; murder and royal assassinations, wealthy marriages and unfair divorce, international conspiracy and deliberate fabrication of incorrect military reports, climate change and drought, ships emerging in various countries difficult. The author describes in detail the historical events, figures, and backgrounds of more than 3,000 years ago, so that the past history is born to the readers. In a highly internationalized world, the close trade, culture and economic links of various countries form a huge system of civilization. Each city-state and country is a network node, and it takes a whole body to move all over the world. Any node has a natural disaster or artificial impact. Or destruction, it is likely to cause ""systemic crash""! Through this book, readers will also reflect on the history of 3,000 years ago. Will it be repeated in this era that the civilization has disappeared and the crisis has disappeared?
The historical ecosystem: If the late Bronze Age did not die, what direction would the history follow? The late Bronze Age civilization was regarded as the golden age of world history and symbolized a crucial period of successful global economic prosperity. If the civilization of this period did not go into ruin, is the history of history completely different?
