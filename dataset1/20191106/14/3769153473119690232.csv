Introducing Krita-Artists.org - A community for Krita artists, developers and enthusiasts.After coming back from the Blender conference the maintainer of the Krita project Boudewijn Rempt wished for a website for Krita community similar to Blenderartists.org, which will be maintained by the community and not by the developers or core team.Some of the community members liked this idea and took to the task of creating the website and the result is krita-artists.org.We would like to invite all Krita artists and enthusiasts to come and join us on the new forum, share artworks made with Krita, share experiences working with Krita, collaborate with others, provide feedback to the Krita developers and have fun together.A lot of thanks to Discourse and blenderartists.org for leading the way and being inspiration to this website.
