The Thai diplomat said that political consultations between Thai and Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs were due to be held in January 2020 in Islamabad to review the progress of the FTA.
“The Karachi chamber can also play a vital role in the consultations by pushing the government to expedite and complete all the work prior to the meeting in January,” he added. The consul general pointed out that Pak-Thai Business House was launched at the Thai consulate following the completion of its first year of service in Karachi.
“The consulate intends to strengthen bilateral ties through this platform, which has already received 10 inquiries pertaining to the two-way trade,” he said. He revealed that in December, a Pakistani delegation will visit Thailand.
