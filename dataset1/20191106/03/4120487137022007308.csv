【海外网】5天前的凌晨，日本世界遗产冲绳首里城迹深夜突发大火，正殿、北殿和南殿被完全烧毁，整体建筑面目全非。令人痛心的是损失不仅仅止于此。冲绳县议会文教厚生委员会5日宣布，在首里城大火中被烧毁的正殿下方有被登记为世界遗产的遗迹，里面混进了碎石砖瓦，一些石墙等珍贵遗迹可能已完全损坏。目前日方正在清除瓦砾，调查受灾详情。据日本《冲绳时报》5日消息，冲绳县议会文教厚生委员会当日还表示，日本的国家指定名胜“首里城书院・锁之间庭园”可能也受到损坏，目前相关人员正在统计损失。所幸的是，一部分冲绳县指定有形文化财产被保存于防火收藏库房中，“白泽之图”、“黑漆菊花鸟虫七宝系沉金食笼”、“黑漆牡丹七宝系沉金食笼”等都幸免于难。比如“白泽之图”，存放在南殿库房里，起火时的火焰和灭火时喷的水等几乎都没有破坏到它。但还有两件文化财产在库房里可能受到了热度和水的影响，目前正在评估损失程度。据悉，与琉球王国相关的众多珍贵艺术品可能都毁在了大火之中。另有日媒报道称，首里城内的约1500件文物中，约3成，即421件文物被烧毁。“雪中花鸟图”及清朝康熙帝赠予琉球王的“中山世土”匾额亦已烧毁。首里城从15世纪至19世纪一直是琉球国都城和王宫的所在地。这座城堡在1933年被指定为日本国宝。第二次世界大战期间，日本陆军第32军在首里城地下挖掘坑道，设置指挥所。在1945年3月的冲绳战役中，该城被美国海军飞机及战列舰多次轰击。1945年3月29日，美国海军“密西西比”号战列舰开火炮轰首里城，将其完全摧毁。首里城遗址在二战结束后被用作琉球大学的校址。1958年，守礼门重建。1992年开始主体建筑复原工作。2000年首里城被联合国教科文组织列为世界文化遗产。

421 pieces of cultural relics or destroyed in the Shuri Castle fire

06 Nov 2019, 03:31

[Overseas] In the early morning of 5 days, the world heritage site of the world heritage site of Okinawa, Okinawa, burst into flames in the middle of the night. The main hall, the north hall and the south hall were completely destroyed. The whole building was completely unrecognizable. The sad thing is that the loss does not stop there. The Okinawa Prefectural Council's Culture and Education Committee on the 5th announced that there were ruins registered as World Heritage Sites under the main hall burned in the Shuri Castle fire. The gravel tiles were mixed in, and some precious relics such as stone walls may have been completely damaged. At present, the Japanese side is clearing the rubble and investigating the details of the disaster. According to the Japanese ""Okinawa Times"" news on the 5th, the Okinawa Prefectural Council's Culture and Education Committee for Health and Welfare also said that Japan's national designated scenic spot ""Shuri City College and Lock Garden"" may also be damaged, and the relevant personnel are currently counting losses. Fortunately, some of the tangible cultural property designated by Okinawa Prefecture was preserved in the fire-fighting collection warehouse, ""the map of Bai Ze"", ""black lacquer chrysanthemum bird and seven treasures Shenjin food cage"", ""black lacquer peony seven treasures Shenjin food cage ""Everything is spared."" For example, ""the map of Bai Ze"" is stored in the warehouse of Nandian. The flames during the fire and the water sprayed during the fire are almost not destroyed. However, there are still two cultural properties that may be affected by heat and water in the warehouse, and the extent of the damage is currently being assessed. It is reported that many precious artworks related to the Ryukyu Kingdom may have been destroyed in the fire. Another Japanese media reported that about 30,000 pieces of the 1,500 pieces of cultural relics in Shuri City were burnt down. The ""Flowers and Birds in the Snow"" and the ""Zhongshan Shitu"" donated by Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty have also been burned. Shuri Castle was the seat of the Ryukyu National Capital City and the Royal Palace from the 15th to the 19th century. The castle was designated as the national treasure of Japan in 1933. During the Second World War, the 32nd Army of the Japanese Army excavated the tunnel in the underground of Shuri City and set up a command post. In the Battle of Okinawa in March 1945, the city was bombarded several times by US Navy aircraft and battleships. On March 29, 1945, the US Navy's ""Mississippi"" battleship opened fire on the city of Seoul and completely destroyed it. The Shuri Castle Ruins were used as the campus of the University of the Ryukyus after the end of World War II. In 1958, the gatekeeper was rebuilt. In 1992, the main building restoration work began. In 2000, Shuri Castle was listed as a World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.
