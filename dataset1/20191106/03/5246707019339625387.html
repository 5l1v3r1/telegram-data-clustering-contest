      <p><b>Update 2 - Wed 6th Nov, 2019 03:05 GMT:</b> We've got yet another look at the apparent redesign (thanks again, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/stories/348526-rumor-yet-another-look-at-sonic-s-redesign-for-the-upcoming-mov">GoNintendo</a>). It's just a matter of waiting for a more official announcement now.</p>

      <p><b>Update - Sun 27th Oct, 2019 09:00 GMT:</b> Another look at the apparent movie redesign of Sonic the Hedgehog has reportedly appeared online (thanks, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/stories/347799-rumor-another-look-at-sonic-s-potential-redesign-for-the-upcomin">GoNintendo</a>), and it seemingly matches the existing images supplied by @TailsChannel.</p>
      <p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/JoskiLani">@JoskiLani</a> says they uploaded the photo on behalf of the original poster to ensure the person responsible for the supposed "leak" remained anonymous.</p>

      <p><b>Original Story - Tue 15th Oct, 2019 11:45 BST:</b> Back in May this year, the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie's director <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/sonic_movie_director_promises_to_change_controversial_design">promised that the titular character would be redesigned</a> after what can only be described as <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/sonics_co-creator_feels_responsible_for_movie_trailer_backlash">very passionate feedback</a> from fans. Now, images have surfaced online which allegedly show how Sonic will look in his new form.</p>
      <p>You can see both of these images in the tweet below. The uploader, @TailsChannel, says that the images were obtained from "a friend in Paramount Studios". It all seems particularly fishy to us so we'd definitely take what you see with a pinch of salt, but the design <i>does</i> look closer to what fans probably expected, whether it's real or not.</p>

      <p>It's impossible to know for sure whether this might be the real deal, of course, but at least Sonic won't end up looking like that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/random_hooray_now_everyone_can_look_just_like_movie_sonic">horrible Walmart Sonic costume</a> we shared the other day. That thing's still giving us nightmares.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Sonic's also just been <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/sonic_will_be_a_hidden_playable_character_in_super_monkey_ball_on_switch">announced as a playable character</a> in the upcoming <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_blitz_hd"><b>Super Monkey Ball</b></a> game on Switch.</p>
