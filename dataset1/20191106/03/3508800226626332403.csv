醫護人員：周梓樂康復機會渺茫、要搵出真相
06 Nov 2019, 03:24 by 蕭雲


我們想讓你知道的是「就假設因為避催淚彈而墜樓，嗰度有咩威脅？警方嘅暴力點解完全冇克制？因為佢地嘅暴力完全冇後果。」



一位在伊利沙伯醫院工作的醫護人員解釋，周梓樂的情況甚差，恐怕過不了這關，也許會在這幾天面臨腦死。
她解釋周同學雖已多番接受手術，包括切除顳葉（Temporal Lobe）和接受降壓藥物，惜收效甚微，腦壓仍高居不下，超出常人多倍。
因為周同學受傷後出現嚴重的腦腫而無法舒緩。腦部位於頭顱內有限的空間，一旦受傷而腫脹，壓力會令血腋便再難輸入腦部，導致缺氧腦死。
她解釋「植物人」與「腦死亡」的分別。「植物人」的腦幹仍然運作，能夠維持心肺功能；然而「腦死亡」即正式死亡。
種種跡象反映周同學傾向後者：一、他的心肺功能須靠機器維持；二、他的瞳孔已對光線沒反應；三、本來下丘腦會不斷分泌ADH荷爾蒙以抑制腎臟排尿，但周同學出現「尿崩」（Diabetes Insipidus），下丘腦已不再運作。
現在醫生們正在用麻醉藥和降壓藥，讓周同學的腦部得以休息，但「冇可能無止境用落去」，深切治療部的醫生可能將於未來數日與周同學家人商量停藥，再檢查周同學是否已腦死亡。
網上有傳周同學可能遭催淚彈或布袋彈直接擊中，但醫護人員說：「他似乎冇中彈傷口」，不太可能因中彈而墜樓。
然而她也有很大疑問，即使周同學要躲避催淚彈，也未必迫切到要跨欄逃生，他墜樓背後可能還有其他原因，她希望停車場與車主都不吝提供影片佐證。
「就假設因為避催淚彈而墜樓，嗰度有咩威脅？警方嘅暴力點解完全冇克制？因為佢地嘅暴力完全冇後果。我依啲中年人好快兩腳一伸，但下一代人點算呢？」
醫護人員解釋若周同學不幸返魂乏術，因他已曾接受診治，清楚死因，故毋須驗屍。但據她經驗必定要開死因庭調查。
筆者與受訪者一直喝著咖啡，但我們的姿態就像在喝酒。「我面對死人已經十幾年，未試過咁感觸。」
「點解周同學會跌落去受重傷，要搵出真相。」

Medical staff: Zhou Yule's chances of recovery, to find out the truth
06 Nov 2019, 03:24 by Xiao Yun


What we want you to know is ""I assume that I have fallen from the building because I avoided the tear gas bombs. Is there a threat to the police? The police are violently trying to get rid of all the restraint? Because the violence is completely devastating.""



A medical staff working at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital explained that Zhou Xiaole's situation is very poor, I am afraid that I can't pass this, and I may face brain death in these days.
She explained that although Zhou has been undergoing surgery many times, including removing the Temporal Lobe and receiving antihypertensive drugs, the results are very small, and the brain pressure is still high, which is many times more than ordinary people.
Because Zhou’s students suffered from severe brain swelling after injury, they could not be relieved. The brain is located in a limited space in the skull. Once it is injured and swollen, the pressure will make it difficult for the blood to enter the brain, leading to hypoxia and brain death.
She explained the difference between ""vegetarian"" and ""brain death."" The brains of the ""vegetative"" are still functioning to maintain heart and lung function; however, ""brain death"" is officially dead.
All kinds of signs reflect Zhou's tendency to the latter: First, his cardiopulmonary function must be maintained by the machine; Second, his pupil has not responded to light; Third, the hypothalamus will continue to secrete ADH hormones to inhibit kidney urination, but Zhou appeared. Diabetes Insipidus, the hypothalamus is no longer functioning.
Now doctors are using anesthetics and antihypertensive drugs to allow Zhou’s brain to rest, but “there may be no end to use.” The doctors in the intensive care unit may discuss the withdrawal with the family of Zhou’s family in the next few days. Then check if Zhou’s classmates have died.
On the Internet, Zhou’s classmates may be directly hit by tear gas or bag bombs, but the medical staff said: “He seems to be licking the wound” and is unlikely to fall from the building due to the bullet.
However, she also has great doubts. Even if Zhou students want to avoid tear gas, they may not be eager to escape from the hurdles. There may be other reasons behind his fall. She hopes that the parking lot and the owner will not provide video evidence.
""I suppose that because of the tear gas bombs, I fell into the building. Is there a threat to the police? The police are violent and completely relieved of restraint? Because the violence is completely devastating. I rely on the middle-aged people to stretch their feet, but the next generation. What about counting?""
The medical staff explained that if Zhou’s classmates were unfortunate enough to return to their souls, he had already been treated and had a clear cause of death, so he was not required to undergo an autopsy. However, according to her experience, it is necessary to open a death court investigation.
The author and the interviewee have been drinking coffee, but our attitude is like drinking. ""I have been facing the dead for more than a decade and have not tried it.""
""After the week, the classmates will fall and be seriously injured, and they must find out the truth.""
