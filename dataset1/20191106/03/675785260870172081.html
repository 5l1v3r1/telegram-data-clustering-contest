      <h1>LeBaron murders: Victim's dad says cartels killed two other relatives in 2009</h1>
      <h2>Heartbroken dad Adrián LeBaron said cartel members wanted to 'teach fear' by killing his daughter and four grandchildren</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T03:31:18+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 03:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The father of one of the Americans killed in a bloody Mexican cartel massacre claims drug lords also murdered two of his relatives in 2009.</p>
      <p>Nine members of the LeBaron family were slaughtered in the Mexican border state of Sonora on Monday while traveling in a convoy from the Mormon La Mora religious settlement, where they lived.</p>
      <p>Heartbroken dad Adrián LeBaron's has now revealed that two of his nephews were also killed 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>His daughter Rhonita Maria LeBaron and four grandchildren, including six-month-old twins, were shot dead in the latest attack.</p>
      <p>Mothers Dawna Langford and Christina Langford Johnson were also killed, along with Ms Langford's two sons, aged three and 11.</p>

      <p>Mr LeBaron's nephew, Eric, was kidnapped by cartel members in 2009, although he was released after the family refused to pay a £776,400 ransom, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7652603/Relatives-family-killed-Mexico-cartel-kidnapped-10-years-ago.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Two other nephews, Benjamin and Luis, were killed months later after Benjamin spoke out about Eric's kidnapping - and Luis tried to protect his brother from the gang.</p>
      <p>Mr LeBaron told Mail Online that the cartels 'killed innocent people to teach fear'.</p>

      <p>He added: "It is not an attack against our community, what we have here is a protest.</p>
      <p>"They are making a statement and I do not know towards who. However, they killed my daughter with that purpose.</p>
      <p>"Just as in 2009, we did not want to pay a ransom, we have never accepted when they harass you, when they extort you. I do not tell that group, I'm telling any group that exists in our Mexico that we do not give in."</p>
      <p>A relative, Julian LeBaron, called the incident a massacre and said some family members were burned alive.</p>

      <p>In a text message to Reuters he wrote that four boys, two girls and three women were killed.</p>
      <p>Several children who fled the attack were lost for hours in the countryside before being found, he said.</p>
      <p>He added that it was unclear who carried out the attack, although the Mexican government believes drug cartels were responsible.</p>

      <p>Mexican Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the nine may have been victims of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>But the LeBaron extended family has often been in conflict with drug traffickers in Chihuahua and a relative of the victims said the killers surely knew who they were targeting.</p>
      <p>Alex LeBaron said: "We've been here for more than 50 years. There's no-one who doesn't know them. Whoever did this was aware. That's the most terrifying."</p>

      <p>All of the dead were US citizens, he told Reuters, and most also held dual citizenship with Mexico.</p>
      <p>They were attacked while driving on backroads in a convoy of cars containing the women along with 14 children, he said.</p>
      <p>Some were heading for Tucson airport to collect relatives.</p>
      <p>A video posted on social media showed the charred and smoking remains of the bullet-riddled vehicle ambushed by the gunmen.</p>
