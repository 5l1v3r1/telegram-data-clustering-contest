安倍专机事故后续： 日本防卫相公开谢罪 飞机将全面检修

06 Nov 2019, 03:42

【海外网】当地时间5日，日本防卫相河野太郎为近日发生在首相安倍晋三专机上的骚乱致歉，称当时的情况为“密封包装的面包在加热过程中冒烟”。据日本《朝日新闻》5日报道，当地时间3日下午，安倍乘坐专机从日本羽田机场飞往泰国曼谷，期间机上做饭用的烤箱在加热面包时冒烟，乘务员很快用灭火器进行了处理，无人员受伤。安倍此行是为出席东盟相关首脑会议，机上除了安倍本人以外，还有一些政府官员以及随行的媒体人员等。事故并未对飞行造成影响，专机按计划继续飞往泰国。据了解，该专机型号为波音777-300ER，随着日本政府的旧专机波音747更新换代，新专机于今年4月起投入运航。这架政府专机属于日本国有，使用的优先顺序依次为皇族、首相 、国宾、最高法院长官、参众两院议长、国务大臣。日本法律还规定，同一架飞机里，不可以有两名要员。日本航空自卫队负责担任飞行任务，而日本航空队隶属于防务省，因此防卫相河野太郎5日代表防卫省公开“谢罪”，并表示除了烤箱以外，机上其他设备均未出现异常。最后这位网友则给出了自己的建议，“根据11月3日朝日新闻的报道的话，加热中的面包因为烤焦而冒烟，所以原因可以确定是面包烤焦了是吧。如果是这样的话，犯了错的队员送去炊事班吧。”据称，安倍将5日将乘坐该架飞机返回日本，自卫队则将在飞机返回后对其进行全面检修。

Follow-up of Abe plane accident: Japanese defense center publicly pleaded guilty

06 Nov 2019, 03:42

[Overseas] On the 5th local time, Japanese Defense Minister Taro Nono apologized for the recent riots on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plane, saying that the situation was “seal-packed bread smoking during heating”. According to Japan’s Asahi Shimbun on the 5th, on the afternoon of the 3rd local time, Abe flew from Japan’s Haneda Airport to Bangkok, Thailand, during which the oven for cooking on the machine smoked while heating the bread. The flight attendants quickly processed it with a fire extinguisher. No injuries were reported. Abe’s trip was to attend the ASEAN-related summit. In addition to Abe himself, there were some government officials and accompanying media personnel. The accident did not affect the flight and the special plane continued to fly to Thailand as planned. It is understood that the model of the special plane is Boeing 777-300ER. With the renewal of the old Japanese Boeing 747, the new special plane will be put into operation in April this year. This government plane belongs to the state-owned state of Japan, and the priority order of use is the royal family, the prime minister, the state guest, the chief of the Supreme Court, the speaker of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the Minister of State. Japanese law also stipulates that there should be no two key personnel in the same aircraft. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force is responsible for the flight mission, and the Japanese Air Force is affiliated with the Ministry of Defense. Therefore, the defense of the Japanese army, Taro Kono, on behalf of the Ministry of Defense on the 5th, publicly ""thank you,"" and said that except for the oven, there was no abnormality in other equipment on board. In the end, the netizen gave his suggestion. ""According to the report of the Asahi Shimbun on November 3, the heated bread is smoked because of the scorching, so the reason can be sure that the bread is burnt. If so If the wrong team member sent it to the accident class, it is said that Abe will return to Japan on the 5th, and the Self-Defense Force will carry out a comprehensive overhaul after the aircraft returns.
