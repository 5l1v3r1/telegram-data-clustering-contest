      <h1>Knife-wielding man attacks Hong Kong pro-Beijing lawmaker</h1>

      <p>HONG KONG, Nov 6 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man on Wednesday attacked a pro-Beijing lawmaker who has taken a tough stand against anti-government protests in Hong Kong, police said, as more demonstrations were planned for the Asian financial hub.</p>
      <p>Legislator Junius Ho, his assistant and the alleged attacker were taken to hospital with unspecified injuries following the assault, police said.</p>
      <p>The attacker's motive was unknown but Ho gained notoriety among anti-government protesters in July when he was filmed laughing and shaking hands with suspected triad gang members who assaulted peaceful demonstrators.</p>
      <p>The attack on Ho comes amid more than five months of sometimes violent political unrest in the former British colony-turned semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Further protests were planned on Wednesday at some of Hong Kong's universities, activists said. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters at a Guy Fawkes-themed march on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>China's Communist Party said on Tuesday it would not tolerate any "separatist behaviour" in Hong Kong, after some of the protesters called for independence.</p>
      <p>What started as a protest against a proposed China extradition bill has widened into the gravest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping's rule since he came to power in 2012.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding an end to perceived Chinese meddling in the territory's affairs, as well as universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, among other demands.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies interfering and blames foreign governments for fuelling the unrest.</p>
      <p>Xi met Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday in Shanghai, vouching support for her administration.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting, Lam denied rumours that the government was considering an amnesty for protesters charged with offences. (Reporting by Donny Kwok and Clare Jim; Writing by Farah Master; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Stephen Coates)</p>
