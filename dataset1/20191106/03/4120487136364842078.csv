韩前法务部长妻子再接受调查 传唤曹国日程或延后

06 Nov 2019, 03:44

【中新网】5日，已被拘留的韩国前法务部长官曹国的妻子郑敬心到检查机关接受调查。这也是11月2日之后，时隔三天，她再次接受调查。据韩国检方透露，首尔中央地方检察厅反腐败调查2部5日上午在首尔拘留所传唤调查郑敬心。据悉，检察机关在对其拘留后，共进行了6次通报传唤。以身体健康原因为由，郑敬心缺席了两次传唤调查。检察机关在10月25日和27日的两次调查中，主要询问了升学考试腐败和毁灭证据的嫌疑。29日的第三次调查开始，集中调查私募基金嫌疑。另外，由于郑敬心的拘留令将于11月11日到期，审问日程又在不断延后，因此有人预测传唤调查曹国的时间也会比预想的晚一些。检察机关在5日的调查中，预计也会重点确认投资资金出处等与私募基金疑惑相关的事实关系。曹国于2019年9月被任命为韩国法务部长官，但由于媒体披露其女儿入学涉嫌伪造文书、家人涉嫌投资私募基金避税等，掀起巨大舆论风波。一个多月来，民众不断组织大规模集会活动抗议。10月14日，曹国宣布辞职。10月24日，韩国法院签发了曹国妻子郑敬心的拘捕令。截止目前，曹国家人共有3人被检方拘留。

Han’s former Minister of Justice’s wife accepts another investigation and summons Cao’s agenda or delays

06 Nov 2019, 03:44

[Zhongxin.com] On the 5th, Zheng Jingxin, the wife of former Korean Minister of Justice Cao Guo, who had been detained, went to the inspection agency for investigation. This is also after November 2, after three days, she was again investigated. According to the South Korean prosecutor, the Anti-Corruption Investigation Department of the Central District Prosecutor's Office in Seoul on the 5th morning summoned Zheng Jingxin at the Seoul Detention Center. It is reported that the procuratorate conducted a total of six briefings after his detention. On the grounds of physical health reasons, Zheng Jingxin missed two summoning investigations. In two investigations on October 25 and 27, the procuratorate mainly questioned the suspicion of corruption and destruction of the test. The third investigation on the 29th began, focusing on the investigation of private fund suspects. In addition, since Zheng Jingxin’s detention order will expire on November 11, the interrogation schedule is being postponed, so some people predict that the time for summoning Cao Guo will be later than expected. In the investigation on the 5th, the procuratorate is also expected to focus on confirming the factual relationship between the source of investment funds and other issues related to private fund doubts. Cao Guo was appointed as the Minister of Justice of the Republic of Korea in September 2019. However, due to media reports that his daughter was suspected of falsifying documents and family members were suspected of investing in private equity funds to avoid taxation, there was a huge public opinion storm. For more than a month, the people have continuously organized large-scale assembly activities to protest. On October 14, Cao announced his resignation. On October 24, the Korean court issued a warrant for the arrest of Cao Guo’s wife Zheng Jingxin. Up to now, a total of three people in the Cao nationality have been detained by the prosecution.
