      <h1>Coming in IPL 2020: Exclusive no-ball umpire</h1>

      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It's still not clear, though, if that 'special umpire' would be the third or fourth umpire, or a new gentleman in the umpiring team altogether.</li>
        <li>The need for this new rule seems to have been instigated by a number of cases in the last IPL when the umpires didn't give genuine no balls, costing teams matches from a crucial position.</li>

      <p>MUMBAI: The 2020 edition of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> could have a special umpire just to monitor no-balls. The idea was floated and accepted well at a meeting of the IPL Governing Council, chaired by former India batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brijesh-Patel">Brijesh Patel</a>, at the BCCI HQ here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It's still not clear, though, if that 'special umpire' would be the third or fourth umpire, or a new gentleman in the umpiring team altogether.</p>
      <p>The need for this new rule seems to have been instigated by a number of cases in the last IPL when the umpires didn't give genuine no balls, costing teams matches from a crucial position.</p>
      <p>A primary case was India and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-2018-complete-squad-of-royal-challengers-bangalore/articleshow/62690441.cms">Royal Challengers Bangalore</a> skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> coming down heavily on umpire S Ravi after the final delivery of their match against the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/2018-ipl-auction-complete-ipl-squad-of-mumbai-indians/articleshow/62683658.cms">Mumbai Indians</a>, bowled by pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lasith-Malinga">Lasith Malinga</a>, turned out to be 'no-ball' which was not awarded to the losing team.</p>
      <p>"We are playing at the IPL level. It's not club level, the umpires should have their eyes open. That was a big no-ball," a livid Kohli had said at the post-match presentation ceremony. Even MI captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> was critical of the standard of umpiring during the match.</p>
      <p>"During the next IPL, you may see another umpire, apart from the regular umpires just to 'observe' the no-balls. The concept sounds weird, but this was among the issues discussed in the first IPL Governing Council meeting which was held here," a senior GC member told reporters after the meeting.</p>
      <p>"We want to use the technology. We are having another umpire for only observing no-balls. There will be an umpire, who will be focused on no-balls only. He may not be third or fourth umpire," he said.</p>
      <p>The innovative concept of having such umpires could be tried at any of the domestic tournament before a final call will be taken on it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>YES TO NO-BALL UMPIRES</b>
      </p>
      <p>o The IPL will see an exclusive TV umpire just for monitoring no-balls from the 2020 edition onwards.</p>
      <p>o This extra match official may be separate from the third and fourth umpires. He will use the tech to help on-field officials monitor no-balls.</p>
      <p>o Matches with an extra umpire likely to be trialled in a domestic tournament like the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament and Ranji Trophy.</p>
      <p>o Controversial no-ball calls have dogged the IPL in recent times. Earlier this year, both Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni criticised wrong no-ball calls.</p>
      <p>o The ICC, incidentally, has also decided to conduct trials with an umpire monitoring front-foot no-balls.</p>
