聯合國世界衛生組織（WHO）1948年對於健康的定義為：「健康係指個人在生理、心理及社會層面，均能保持和諧安寧之最佳狀況，並非僅指無疾病或虛弱的情況」（Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity），若一個人身心都健康，才是真正的健康。
根據研究指出（註一），2010年全球因疾病產生的支出中，心理疾病占10.4%，且造成的經濟損失亦十分重大；推估自2011年至2030年間，因心理疾病造成全球經濟損失將達16.3兆美元。此外，聯合國世界衛生組織在2018年發布之新聞稿指出，全球目前已超過3億人口為憂鬱症所苦，更預測2020年憂鬱症將成為嚴重性僅次於心血管疾病的重大疾病，因此，推動心理健康工作之重要性，不言而喻。
對於有心理困擾或心理疾病症狀的人而言，心理諮商可說是早期診斷和治療的重要方式。根據英國Layard, Richard (2012)（註二）研究指出，心理困擾所帶來的影響及諮商的重要性包括：

心理困擾對生活品質衝擊影響幅度甚大 心理困擾對個人生活功能影響，平均而言會比身體疾病造成的影響高出50%。
心理困擾受關注程度遠低於身體疾病 身體有疾病者多已接受治療，但有心理困擾的人僅25%接受治療。
心理困擾會加重身體疾病嚴重程度 心理困擾往往會加重身體疾病的嚴重度，導致原有的身體疾病更難以治療。
心理諮商有長期療效並可減少復發 以失眠問題為例，美國、日本和澳洲均有研究指出，心理諮商比安眠藥更具療效。

觀察國際趨勢可發現，在科技的進步下，全球主要經濟體已競相投資｢資訊科技及通訊技術（ICTs）｣產業，透過「E Health」方式在任何時間、任何地點提供普及、可靠，且具備可近性的健康照護方式。然而，相對於生理健康在科技進步下得到更好的照顧，心理健康服務則未得到相同的重視與發展。
隨著數位科技發展興起之「平臺經濟」（Platform Economy）服務模式，透過網路平臺提供包含心理諮商在內的醫事專業服務也順勢崛起。例如美國、日本等國家，已陸續放寬醫療相關法規之限制，逐步開放醫療網路服務的範圍，目前提供心理諮商平臺的業者簡要介紹如下：
美國－Breakthrough
2009年成立，為第一家可在全美各州提供網路心理治療及諮商服務的公司。該平臺有超過1,300位心理治療師線上執業，為民眾提供心理治療、心理諮商服務或家庭/婚姻諮商和酗酒/藥物成癮諮商等網路服務，每月服務人次達3千名。
美國－Talkspace
2014年成立，至今已累計50萬名使用者，提供匿名線上心理治療服務，解決民眾因尷尬而不願尋求諮商協助的問題。且該平臺設計出一套病患－心理師媒合系統，能依據病患需求和問卷內容篩選出最適合的心理師，現有超過3,000位心理師於該平臺線上執業。
日本－Cotree
2012年成立，為民眾提供量身訂製的在線諮詢，包括口語諮詢和訊息諮詢兩種方式，費用較日本一般身心科門診低廉；另一方面諮商師們可免費透過 cotree 平臺打造個人品牌、增加接觸病患機會，現有超過60位臨床心理師於該平臺執業。
資訊通訊技術日新月異，透過網路進行心理諮商的效益已漸被肯定。對於民眾而言，相關的利益包括：

節省民眾就醫時間及交通費用以美國IHS Tele-Behavioral Health Center of Excellence （TBHCE）為例，2013年IHS患者透過網路醫療減少的交通距離，相當於30.5萬美金交通費用。
保障民眾隱私權，提高心理諮商意願透過網路科技可保障用戶隱私，避免民眾因尷尬而不願尋求諮商協助，可因此提高心理諮商意願。
有效預防心理疾病，促進線上心理健康管理普及化開發網路智慧型線上心理健康管理工具，可建立國內民眾自我心理健康管理意識，有效預防心理疾病。
提升心理服務可及性與涵蓋率，促進國民心理健康結合雲端科技、資訊化心理健康服務，突破地域和時間障礙，可增加民眾利用率；另一方面，可促進心理健康傳播及提供多元服務管道，提升民眾心理服務的可及性和涵蓋率。

透過網路科技而產生的創新服務模式已經席捲全球，網路心理諮商服務在本質上也是數位經濟下重要的商業模式之一。目前，我國相關法規對於網路心理諮商行為及服務能否運作，已推動相應的法規調適或鬆綁，不僅有利於我國中小及新創業者開發新興商業模式，亦可廣泛嘉惠有相關需求之民眾，促進國人心理健康的維護。

Development of online psychological counseling and international experience
06 Nov 2019, 03:12 by Innovation Sandbox


What we want you to know is that the innovative service model generated through network technology has swept the world. Internet counseling service is one of the important business models in the digital economy. China's online psychological counseling behaviors and services have promoted the appropriate regulation or loosening of regulations, which is not only conducive to the development of new business models for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, but also to broaden the people with relevant needs and promote the maintenance of mental health of Chinese people.




Written by: The Third Research Institute of China Economic Research Institute Lin Bojun, Lin Yijun, Assistant Researcher

The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in 1948 as: ""Health means that the individual can maintain the best condition of harmony and tranquility at the physiological, psychological and social levels, not just the absence of disease or weakness."" Is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not simply the absence of disease or infirmity), if a person is physically and mentally healthy, it is true health.
According to the research (Note 1), among the global expenditures due to diseases, mental illness accounted for 10.4% in 2010, and the economic losses caused by it are also very significant. It is estimated that the global economic losses caused by mental illness will be between 2011 and 2030. It reached 16.3 trillion US dollars. In addition, the press release issued by the United Nations World Health Organization in 2018 pointed out that more than 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression, and it is predicted that depression in 2020 will become a serious disease after cardiovascular disease. Therefore, The importance of promoting mental health work is self-evident.
For people with symptoms of psychological distress or mental illness, counseling is an important way of early diagnosis and treatment. According to research by Layard, Richard (2012) (Note 2), the impact of psychological distress and the importance of consultation include:

Psychological distress has a great impact on the quality of life. Psychological distress affects the individual's life function, and on average it is 50% higher than the impact of physical illness.
Psychological distress is much less concerned than physical illness. People with physical illnesses have been treated, but only 25% of people with psychological problems receive treatment.
Psychological distress can increase the severity of physical illness. Psychological distress often aggravates the severity of physical illness, making the original physical illness more difficult to treat.
Psychological counseling has long-term efficacy and can reduce recurrence. Insomnia is an example. Studies in the United States, Japan, and Australia have shown that counseling is more effective than sleeping pills.

Observing international trends, we can see that under the advancement of technology, the world's major economies have been competing to invest in the ""Information Technology and Communication Technology (ICTs)"" industry, providing universal access, reliability and availability at any time and any place through the ""E Health"" approach. Approachable health care. However, compared with physical health and better care under the advancement of science and technology, mental health services have not received the same attention and development.
With the development of the ""Platform Economy"" service model of digital technology, the provision of medical professional services including psychological counseling through the Internet platform has also emerged. For example, the United States, Japan and other countries have gradually relaxed the restrictions on medical regulations, and gradually opened up the scope of medical network services. The current provider of counseling platforms is briefly introduced as follows:
United States-Breakthrough
Established in 2009, it is the first company to offer online psychotherapy and counseling services in all states of the United States. The platform has more than 1,300 psychotherapists online, providing people with online services such as psychotherapy, counseling services or family/marriage counseling and alcohol/drug addiction counseling. The monthly service number is 3,000.
United States - Talkspace
Established in 2014, it has accumulated 500,000 users to provide anonymous online psychotherapy services to solve the problem of people's reluctance to seek counseling assistance. And the platform designed a patient-psychic mediation system, which can select the most suitable psychologist according to the patient's needs and the content of the questionnaire. More than 3,000 psychologists currently practice on the platform.
Japan-Cotree
Established in 2012, it provides tailor-made online consultations, including oral consultation and message consultation. The cost is lower than that of Japanese general physical and mental clinics. On the other hand, consultants can build their own brands through the cotree platform for free. Increased access to patients, more than 60 clinical psychologists currently practice on the platform.
Information and communication technologies are changing with each passing day, and the benefits of psychological counseling through the Internet have gradually been affirmed. For the public, related benefits include:

Saving people's medical time and transportation costs Take the US IHS Tele-Behavioral Health Center of Excellence (TBHCE) as an example. In 2013, IHS patients reduced the traffic distance through Internet medical treatment, equivalent to 305,000 US dollars in transportation costs.
Safeguarding the privacy of the people and improving the willingness to negotiate with the Internet can ensure the privacy of users through the use of Internet technology, and avoid people's reluctance to seek consultation and assistance, so they can increase their willingness to consult.
Effective prevention of mental illness, promotion of online mental health management popularization and development of network intelligent online mental health management tools, can establish domestic people's self-mental health management awareness, and effectively prevent mental illness.
Improve the accessibility and coverage of psychological services, promote national mental health combined with cloud technology, informational mental health services, break through regional and time barriers, increase the utilization rate of the population; on the other hand, promote mental health communication and provide multiple service channels To improve the accessibility and coverage of the public's psychological services.

The innovative service model generated through network technology has swept the world. Internet counseling services are essentially one of the important business models in the digital economy. At present, China's relevant laws and regulations on the operation of online psychological counseling and services have promoted the appropriate regulation or loosening of regulations, which is not only conducive to the development of new business models for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in China, but also to broaden the needs of people with relevant needs. To promote the maintenance of mental health of Chinese people.
