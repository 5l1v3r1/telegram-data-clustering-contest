UK Parliament Dissolved
There will be no legislative business in either chamber until a new Parliament is elected.

06 Nov 2019, 03:07

The UK Parliament announced its dissolution for Tuesday at midnight, local time, 25 days before the upcoming general elections.



The dissolution of the current Parliament means that both the House of Commons and the House of Lords end their activity. A new House of Commons will be elected on 12 December, while the Lords will retain their positions.
Under normal circumstances, a new Speaker of the House is also elected, along with the House of Commons, but this year, Lindsay Hoyle was elected early to replace John Bercow following his September resignation.
Under the Fixed-term Paliaments Act 2011, the UK Parliament must be reelected every five years, which means the next general election was supposed to take place in 2022. However, on 29 October, the House of Commons voted for early elections in December over the ongoing political Brexit impasse.
