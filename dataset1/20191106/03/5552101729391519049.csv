【豪門爆姦情】老公不倫大黑松小倆口千金　安晨妤告小三通姦
06 Nov 2019, 03:29 by 娛樂組, 攝影組
「元祖少奶奶」安晨妤和老公張劭緯鬧婚變，主因是安晨妤在生日當天，收到老公與小三的多張性愛淫照，其中一位竟是大黑松小倆口的千金邱威樺。安晨妤對此發表聲明表示，已對小三邱威樺提告通姦。

聲明如下：

1、已經針對老公張劭緯和大黑松小倆口千金邱威樺提出通姦罪刑法訴訟。目前進入司法審判階段，細節無法一一陳述，敬請見諒。
2、元祖是市值上百億的公司，這雖然是夫妻間的家務事，但張劭緯是元祖二代，現在上海公司處理公司經營，他行為失當，對於元祖企業形象以傳承中華文化、有節有禮為訴求，實在是一大諷刺。他的母親張秀琬女士是元祖創辦人長期在上海努力經營，也很熱心社會公益，目前是上海台商會副會長。至於張劭緯個人行為失當，是否有損元祖企業形象，由社會大眾來評論。過程中多次請張劭緯的母親張秀琬女士出面解決張劭緯的欠款，仍得不到回應。目前訴求張劭緯出面解決後續小孩養育問題並償還之前積欠安晨好2200萬元債務。
3、一直以來安晨妤以企業家自許，白手起家創立開店123網路電商至今19年，公司營運關係員工生計不會因為婚姻的打擊被擊倒。
4、安晨妤現在生活動重心在兩個小孩身上，全力栽培下一代，希望老公可以跟小孩有更多互動，盡到父親應盡的義務。對於這13年婚姻依然珍惜，希望老公早日回歸家庭。

[Grandfather bursts of love] Husband is not a big black pine small couple of money Jinan Chen Chen small three adultery
06 Nov 2019, 03:29 by Entertainment Group, Photography Group
""Mr. Yuan Zuo's grandmother"" An Chenxi and her husband Zhang Yuwei had a marriage change. The main reason was that An Chenxi received a lot of sexual pornography from her husband and Xiaosan on the birthday, and one of them was the daughter of Qiu Weihua. An Chenxi said in a statement that he had filed an adultery against Xiao Sanqiu Weihua.

The statement is as follows:

1, has been against the husband Zhang Weiwei and the big black pine Xiaokoukou Qianjin Qiu Weihua filed a criminal lawsuit for adultery. At present, we are entering the judicial trial stage, and the details cannot be stated one by one. Please forgive me.
2. Yuanzu is a company with a market value of tens of billions. Although this is a chores between husband and wife, Zhang Weiwei is the second generation of Yuanzu. Now the Shanghai company handles the company's operations. He is misbehaving. He inherits Chinese culture and has a good relationship with the image of Yuanzu. The ritual is a great irony. His mother, Ms. Zhang Xiuyan, is the founder of Yuanzu who has been working hard in Shanghai for a long time. She is also very enthusiastic about social welfare. She is currently the vice president of the Shanghai Taiwan Chamber of Commerce. As for Zhang Yiwei's personal misconduct, whether it is detrimental to the image of the ancestral enterprise, the public will comment. In the process, Ms. Zhang Xiuyan, the mother of Zhang Weiwei, was asked to solve Zhang Weiwei’s arrears and still could not get a response. At present, Zhang Yiwei is seeking to solve the problem of follow-up child rearing and repay the debt of 22 million yuan.
3, An Chen has always been an entrepreneur, since the beginning of the establishment of the store 123 network e-commerce business for 19 years, the company's operating relationship staff livelihood will not be knocked down because of the marriage.
4. An Chenxi now focuses on two children and concentrates on the next generation. I hope that my husband can have more interaction with children and fulfill his father’s obligations. I still cherish this 13-year marriage and hope that my husband will return to the family as soon as possible.
