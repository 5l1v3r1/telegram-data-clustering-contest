      <h1>Kentucky elects first black attorney general, first Republican to serve in role in more than 70 years</h1>

      <p>Voters in Kentucky made history Tuesday by electing Republican Daniel Cameron as their next attorney general.</p>
      <p>Cameron is the first black person voted individually to statewide office, the first black attorney general, and the first Republican elected to the role in more than 70 years, <a href="https://www.lex18.com/news/decision-2019/in-historic-win-daniel-cameron-is-next-kentucky-ag">according</a> to Lex18.</p>
      <p>“It's really heartwarming and encouraging when folks regardless of political affiliation walk up to you and express support for the idea that you put yourself out there and made a decision to put your name on a ballot,” Cameron said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cameron, a relative newcomer in politics, defeated Democrat Greg Stumbo, a political heavyweight in Kentucky who was attorney general from 2003 to 2007 and as speaker of the General Assembly from 2009 to 2017.</p>
      <p>Cameron won by a margin of 57.7% to Stumbo’s 42.3%</p>
      <p>President Trump endorsed Cameron at his rally in the state on Monday and said “a star is born” when he brought him up to the stage.</p>
      <p>“Thank you to the people of Kentucky. It’s a great honor to be your next Attorney General and I look forward to hitting the ground running,” Cameron wrote on Twitter after the Tuesday victory.</p>

      <p>Trump also congratulated him after his win, writing, “Great going Daniel, proud of you!”</p>

      <p>Cameron’s victory was overshadowed by Trump ally and incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s apparent defeat to Democrat Andy Beshear, who <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kentucky-gov-matt-bevin-a-trump-ally-trails-democratic-rival-andy-beshear-in-reelection-bid">declared victory Tuesday night</a> in a close race.</p>
      <p>Despite that, Bevin said he would not concede, citing “more than a few irregularities.”</p>
