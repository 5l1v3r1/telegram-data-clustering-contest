聲稱「腳傷」無法繼續韓團EXO活動，與韓國SM娛樂打合約官司的大陸藝人黃子韜，近日在個人微博頻頻放砲，先是發文感嘆自己做的音樂沒有達到預期火爆的反應，放話「若無法感動粉絲之外的人，決定去當個戲子。」該則微博被刪除後，黃子韜又發文表示自己發言沒有錯，不願微博言論被自己以外的人控制，放話「不適合我真的，我退出」。
黃子韜在4年前返回大陸後成立個人工作室，在音樂、綜藝與戲劇方面都有作品，去年主持《創造101》表現不俗，最近主演《熱血少年》飾演小混混吳乾，動作場面親身上陣。黃子韜在5日凌晨感嘆自己用心作的音樂一直無法感動到粉絲之外的人，感嘆「不如當個戲子」，自嘲的言論卻被粉絲攻擊是拿演員身份當備胎。

該則微博後遭刪除，黃子韜再度發文表示不是他刪的，「我已經受夠說完的話，發完的東西第二天給刪了。」他強調自己說的話沒錯，「我說我對不起自己有問題？」在狂嗆不喜歡他的網友「不爽不要看」之後，黃子韜直白地說以後不在微博發自己想發的東西，「不適合我真的，我退出，這是我最後自己發的微博，這種地方根本不值得說任何心裡話。」
