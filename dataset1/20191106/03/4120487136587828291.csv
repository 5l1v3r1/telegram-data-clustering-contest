美政府或因弹劾案再次停摆？ 特朗普含糊其辞

06 Nov 2019, 03:33

【中新网】美国总统特朗普3日表示，不排除其政府在11月下旬关闭的可能性。近日，特朗普身陷“弹劾案”，媒体分析称，他或因此关闭政府。2018年底，美国政府就曾停摆35天。据报道，特朗普近期正面临民主党的弹劾，3日，当被问及是否会因弹劾使政府停摆时，他表示，“不，不，不！这要看情况，我不对任何事做出承诺。这取决于目前的沟通如何。”据报道，议员们必须就为联邦机构提供资金的12项拨款法案，达成协议，或通过另一项暂时的解决方案，以维持当前的支出水平。2019年9月，特朗普签署了一项短期支出法案，为国会议员争取更多时间来调和分歧，尤其是在建立边境墙的资金筹集上面。由于众议院正处于为期10天的休会期，因此众议院和参议院仅剩下8个立法日，两院均在开会，试图达成协议，以避免政府在11月21日的最后期限前关闭。此前，参议院少数党领袖查克舒默（Chuck Schumer）说，他担心特朗普因弹劾调查，关闭政府，以此淡化人们对弹劾案的关注。2018年12月22日，因白宫和国会民主党人就边境墙问题争执不下，致各方未就拨款法案达成一致，政府被迫关门，并创下了35天政府停摆状态的纪录。

Will the US government stop again because of the impeachment case? Trump vague

06 Nov 2019, 03:33

[China News] US President Trump said on the 3rd that the possibility of its government closing in late November is not ruled out. Recently, Trump was caught in the ""impeachment case"", and media analysts said that he may shut down the government. At the end of 2018, the US government had stopped for 35 days. According to reports, Trump is facing the impeachment of the Democratic Party in the near future. On the 3rd, when asked if he would stop the government because of impeachment, he said, ""No, no, no! It depends on the situation, I don't make anything. Commitment. It depends on the current communication.” It is reported that parliamentarians must agree on 12 funding bills for federal agencies, or through another temporary solution to maintain current spending levels. In September 2019, Trump signed a short-term spending bill to get more time for congressmen to reconcile differences, especially in the fundraising of the border wall. Since the House of Representatives is in a 10-day recess, there are only eight legislative days left in the House and Senate, and both houses are in a meeting to try to reach an agreement to avoid the government closing before the November 21 deadline. Earlier, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he was worried that Trump would close the government because of impeachment investigations, thereby diminishing people's attention to the impeachment case. On December 22, 2018, the White House and Congressional Democrats disputed the border wall issue, and the parties failed to reach an agreement on the appropriation bill. The government was forced to close the door and set a record of 35 days of government shutdown.
