Committee confronts cost of council's approval of 14 new suburban communities
06 Nov 2019, 03:58 by Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald
City council members are confronting the budgetary fallout of approving 14 new suburban communities last year.
The city is projecting a temporary $56.9-million budget shortfall over the next three years as a result of slower than expected development in new suburban communities approved last year and 27 other still-developing neighbourhoods, according to data presented at council’s finance committee Tuesday.
The news isn’t sitting well with some inner-city councillors who argue that established neighbourhoods will be facing budget cuts and service reductions this fall — including the likely closure of two inner-city pools — while investment continues on the fringes of the city.
“We’re going to see service cuts to fully built-out neighbourhoods across the city while we’re building new infrastructure in places that people (don’t live),” said Coun. Evan Woolley Tuesday. “This is going to be a big problem in budget.”
The city has a policy that growth must “pay for itself”, particularly when it comes to capital costs, but Tuesday’s meeting revealed that Calgary is falling short of its targets. City staff say the budget shortfalls are the result of reduced revenues from off-site levies charged to developers to fund infrastructure like water and wastewater treatment facilities, roads and fire halls.
Some infrastructure projects could be delayed to help offset the shortfall, city staff said, but other infrastructure, particularly when it comes to water utilities, will have to proceed. New communities must have sewer and water treatment ready for the very first flush of a toilet in the very first house that’s built in a subdivision, said Mayor Naheed Nenshi Tuesday.



Nenshi said there are shortfalls every year in the amount of money that new communities are expected to generate.
“This year, the shortfall was so big that administration is recommending increasing everyone’s sewer rate by 6.7 per cent in order to cover that shortfall,” Nenshi said. “Clearly we’re not abiding by the principle that growth should pay for itself and we’ve got to figure out a better way to do this because otherwise, everyone ends up paying.”
Despite the slower-than-expected development of recently approved communities, developers are already lobbying council to approve at least two more new communities.
At Tuesday’s meeting, city staff urged committee members to set new restrictions on approvals for development. Committee members agreed to some of the restrictions and made tweaks to others.
Coun. Jyoti Gondek said the changes will take “the politics and lobbying out of play” since municipal staff, rather than council members, will take on a larger role in determining if proposed developments meet city criteria.
Committee members also approved an amendment from Coun. Jeff Davison asking the city to explore the phasing out of the so-called “growth management overlay” — a key hurdle for development that requires the city to identify budget for servicing and infrastructure to a new community before it can proceed.
Councillors Druh Farrell and Jeromy Farkas voted against the proposed changes.
“I’m just really concerned that we’re going back in time to just opening up any land that comes forward with a proposal; that really worries me,” said Farrell.
