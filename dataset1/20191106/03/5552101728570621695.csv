【圖解保險】11月8日實支實付險限買3張　6個必知不買錯
06 Nov 2019, 03:37 by 劉以親
11月8日起，規定實支實付醫療險每人最多只能買3張，但已投保者不受影響，實支實付險真有那麼威？6個必知提醒保戶買前多比較。
實支實付醫療險是公認CP值高的保單，但民眾在投保前仍要釐清幾個觀念。首先，實支實付險是損害填補觀念，並非保多少就一定理賠多少；其次，目前各家保險公司的正本、副本理賠規定不相同；再則，多數實支實付險必須住院才能理賠；且保費採自然費率，會隨年齡增加；最後，民眾常忽略保單條款細節藏有重要內容，一定要詳加審閱。
反正投保前多比較準沒錯。至於「限買3張」這件事，倒是不用太在意，因為其實多數人買2張已足夠，當然買的這2張要好好挑選，怎麼挑？以下圖文告訴你。

[Illustration insurance] On November 8th, the actual payment limit is 3, 6 must know not to buy the wrong
06 Nov 2019, 03:37 by Liu Yishen
From November 8th, it is stipulated that the actual payment of medical insurance can only buy up to 3 per person, but the insured person is not affected. 6 must know to remind the policyholders to compare before buying.
The actual payment of medical insurance is a policy with a high CP value, but the public still has to clarify several concepts before insuring. First of all, the actual payment of insurance is to damage the concept of filling, not how much to pay for it; secondly, the current insurance company's original, copy claims are not the same; in addition, most of the actual payment must be hospitalized to claim; And the natural rate of premiums will increase with age; in the end, the people often ignore the details of the policy terms and contain important content, which must be reviewed in detail.
Anyway, before the insurance is more accurate, it is correct. As for the ""limited purchase of 3"", I don't have to care too much, because in fact, most people buy 2 pieces, which is enough. Of course, the 2 pieces you buy should be carefully selected. How do you pick them? The following picture tells you.
