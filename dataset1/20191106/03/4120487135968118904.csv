【中新网】作为面向成田机场航班扩容手续的一环，日本国土交通省5日修改了该机场的基本规划。配合2030年访日游客达6000万人次的政府目标，机场跑道延长及新建的内容被写入其中。全年航班起降额度从目前的30万次扩大至50万次。这是对1966年制定的基本规划进行的首次修改。据报道，手续依据的是中央政府、地方政府与成田国际机场公司（NAA），于2018年3月就功能强化达成的共识。成田国际机场公司今后将提交设施变更的申请，经中央政府许可后启动建设。国交相赤羽一嘉在5日的记者会上表示：“为加强国际竞争力，抓住航空需求不可或缺。”对规划的修改包括，B跑道从目前的2500米延长至3500米，以及建设新跑道。两者均力争在2020年代完成。据悉，成田机场基本规划根据国交相对机场功能等的要求而制定。
