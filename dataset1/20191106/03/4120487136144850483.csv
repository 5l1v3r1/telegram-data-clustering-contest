韩国总统文在寅： 与日本首相安倍的会面“富有意义”

06 Nov 2019, 03:42

【中新社首尔】韩国总统文在寅5日称，与日本首相安倍晋三进行了“富有意义”的会面。11月4日，文在寅与安倍在泰国曼谷进行了会谈，这是继2018年9月纽约联合国大会后，时隔13个月双方再次会谈，也是韩日自今年7月陷入贸易争端后双方领导人首次会面。针对韩日领导人此次会面，韩国总统府青瓦台称，双方在友好的气氛中进行了面对面的对话，约11分钟；双方就通过对话解决问题达成共识。文在寅5日在社交网站发文称，与安倍进行了“富有意义”的会面，这或成为对话的起点。今年7月，日本宣布对出口韩国的三种半导体原材料加强管控，并于8月将韩国移出可享受贸易便利的“白色清单”。随后，韩国也在“白色清单”中“拉黑”日本，并表示不再续签《韩日军事情报保护协定》。近来，韩日双边外交陷入僵持状态。

South Korean President Wen Zai: Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is ""meaningful""

06 Nov 2019, 03:42

[China News Agency, Seoul] South Korean President Wen Zai said on the 5th that he had a ""meaningful"" meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. On November 4th, Wen Zaiyu and Abe held talks in Bangkok, Thailand. After the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2018, the two sides met again after 13 months. It was also the two sides that have entered a trade dispute since July this year. The leader met for the first time. In response to the meeting between the leaders of South Korea and Japan, the South Korean presidential palace, Cheong Wa Dae, said that the two sides had a face-to-face dialogue in a friendly atmosphere for about 11 minutes; the two sides reached a consensus on solving the problem through dialogue. On the 5th, Wen wrote on the social networking site that he had a ""meaningful"" meeting with Abe, which could be the starting point for the dialogue. In July this year, Japan announced that it would strengthen control over the three semiconductor raw materials exported to South Korea, and in August removed South Korea from a “white list” that could enjoy trade facilitation. Subsequently, South Korea also ""blacked out"" Japan in the ""white list"" and said that it would not renew the ""Korean-Japanese Military Intelligence Protection Agreement."" Recently, bilateral diplomacy between South Korea and Japan has been in a stalemate.
