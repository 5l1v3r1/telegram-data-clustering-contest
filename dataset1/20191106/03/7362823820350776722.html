      <p>Eric Trump blasted his father's critics, claiming that many of them have no allegiance to facts but instead are bound by their political agendas.</p>
      <p>Trump also rejected criticisms from media personalities, including one who compared <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> to a movie villain, in an interview Tuesday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Hannity</a>."</p>
      <p>"Facts don't matter, they're willing to lie, they're willing to take anybody down for any reason that fits their narrative," he said.</p>
      <p>"They do it to me, they do it to Don, they do it to Ivanka, they do it to my father every single day."</p>

      <p>Recently, MSNBC analyst John Heilemann claimed the president "sounds like a crime boss" as well as a villain in Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne series.</p>
      <p>"He sounds like someone who was in a Bourne movie," Heilemann said in response to the president firing a former ambassador to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Trump rejected the remark and later said figures in the media will allegedly, "lie, they'll deceive, they'll defraud -- I mean that is who these people are. They're really terrible people."</p>
      <p>In addition, Trump called on the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate to call former Vice President Joe Biden and his 49-year-old son Hunter to testify about their activities in regard to Ukraine.</p>

      <p>He remarked such a hearing would hopefully, "find out what the hell actually happened there."</p>
      <p>Trump also said his father should be commended for showing the GOP how to respond to alleged smears and the like.</p>
      <p>"The Republicans are finally learning how to fight against this awful, awful system," he said.</p>
