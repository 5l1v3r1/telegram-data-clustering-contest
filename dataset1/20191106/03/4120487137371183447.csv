06 Nov 2019, 03:44

【中新网】马来西亚反贪污委员会（MACC）主席拉蒂花5日表示，目前尚有总值约189亿林吉特的一马发展公司（1MDB）资产下落不明，反贪会正与相关国家和地区连手调查。据报道，拉蒂花（Latheefa Beebi Koya）在5日出席的2019年国际金融犯罪与恐怖主义融资会议上透露，这些资产至少散布在5个国家与区域，反贪会正与刚成立不久的国家金融犯罪中心合作，追踪及调查这些资产及涉嫌者的下落。她指出，这些资产事务历史记录并非只有一笔，而是透过复杂的转账，非常不易追查。所以反贪会将积极与相关国家配合，希望透过交换情报来追踪资产下落。但她拒绝透露更多信息，只表示目前所接触的国家配合度高，但不宜透露太多情报，否则会间接让涉嫌者设法逃脱罪名。报道称，拉蒂花补充，目前189亿林吉特只是粗估数字，因为内容涵盖房地产、股票、车辆及其他相关物品，其中房地产与股票的价值每天都不同。扣除这些下落不明的资产，目前经由一马发展公司特工队与美国司法部查获的一马发展公司资产，各有39.3亿林吉特和88.42亿林吉特。

[China News] Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Chairman Latihua said on the 5th that there is still a total of about 18.9 billion ringgit of the development of the company's assets (1MDB), the anti-corruption is related to the country And the area to join hands to investigate. According to reports, Latheefa Beebi Koya revealed at the 2019 International Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing Conference on the 5th that these assets are scattered in at least five countries and regions, and the Anti-Corruption Association is in the newly established country. The Financial Crime Center collaborates to track and investigate the whereabouts of these assets and suspects. She pointed out that the history of these asset transactions is not only one, but through a complicated transfer, it is very difficult to trace. Therefore, the Anti-Corruption Commission will actively cooperate with relevant countries and hope to track the whereabouts of assets by exchanging information. However, she refused to disclose more information. She only said that the countries that are currently in contact with the country have a high degree of cooperation, but it is not appropriate to disclose too much information. Otherwise, the suspects will indirectly let the suspects try to escape the crime. According to the report, Latitu added that the current RM18.9 billion is only a rough estimate because it covers real estate, stocks, vehicles and other related items, and the value of real estate and stocks varies from day to day. After deducting these unidentified assets, the assets of the Malaysian Development Company, which was currently seized by the Malaysian Development Corporation and the US Department of Justice, each had 3.93 billion ringgit and 8.824 billion ringgit.
