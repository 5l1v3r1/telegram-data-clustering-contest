      <p>WASHINGTON: The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday released its order approving T-Mobile US Inc's proposed US$26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp in a vote split along party lines.</p>
      <p>Chairman Ajit Pai and two Republican commissioners voted to approve the deal while two Democratic commissioners voted against it. The FCC commissioners voted earlier this month but the order was not made public until they could cut confidential information and give commissioners time to draft statements.</p>
