      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Unai-Emery">Unai Emery</a> has stripped Granit <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Xhaka">Xhaka</a> of the captaincy and left him out of the Premier League side's squad for their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Europa-League">Europa League</a> game against Portugal's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vitoria">Vitoria</a>.</p>
      <p>"I had a meeting with him and told him he is no longer in the captain's group," the Mirror website quoted the Spaniard as telling reporters on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang takes over the permanent role, although he was also not in the 18-man travelling squad for the match in Guimaraes and Hector Bellerin is likely to stand in instead.</p>
      <p>"He (Xhaka) accepted my decision. We need to carry on and focus on tomorrow's match. I needed to take a decision and now it's closed," said Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are top of Group F after three consecutive victories.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder has been in the spotlight since he reacted angrily to home fans booing him after he was substituted during Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium on Oct. 27.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for the club since then.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday he released an emotional statement to defend his actions, which included storming off the pitch and down the tunnel, and said he had reached a "boiling point" following repeated threats from fans to his wife and daughter.</p>
