四中全會真出大事？王小洪兼任特勤局長不尋常

06 Nov 2019, 03:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月06日訊】中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒在四中全會期間離奇死亡，引發外界對中共權斗出大事的猜測之際，中共公安部副書記王小洪兼任中共新設機構特勤局局長，引發輿論關注 。有分析人士認為，此安排不尋常。
近日，中共公安部新設機構特勤局公布局長人選，中共公安部副書記、常務副部長王小洪兼任特勤局局長。中共公安部機關報4日消息稱，王小洪2日首次以特勤局黨委書記、局長的身分亮相，主持召開了特勤局黨委（擴大）會議。
中共去年啟動公安部隊改革。公安部今年7月首次對外公布內設機構情況。包括：特勤、情報指揮、研究室、督察審計、新聞宣傳、食品藥品犯罪偵查、鐵路公安均為重組或新設機構。
財新網稱，中共公安部絕大多數新設局級機構一把手，並不由公安部副職領導層兼任。而王小洪破格擔任特勤局局長，引發外界關注。
王小洪是習近平的福建舊部，被視為習的親信。習任福州市委書記時，王小洪就是福州市公安局副局長，負責習近平的安全保衛。

據悉，公安部特勤局負責的警衛對象，為中共黨和國家領導人中的「四副兩高」（中共國家副主席、中共人大副委員長、中共國務院副總理／國務委員、中共全國政協副主席、中共最高法院院長、中共最高檢察院檢察長）以及外國訪華要人。
時政評論人士石實分析说，王小洪主掌副國級官員警衛隊，未來警衛局可能會變，特勤局可能會接手，王很可能會掌控所有副國級和正國級的保衛工作，當然還有一個監視工作。
另有分析認為，此次人事安排的時機也不尋常，恰逢四中全會剛剛落幕，而且會議期間「出了人命」，或表明四中全會並不太平，中共黨內權斗可能真出大事，習近平需要其親信親自出馬，掌控中南海高層的生死大權。

延宕一年多的中共四中全會，是在美中貿易戰使得在中國經濟嚴重下行，香港反送中抗爭長達4個多月未息之際召開的。
外界普遍認為，四中全會之所以一拖再拖，是因為中共高層面臨著國內外壓力，中共黨內權斗激烈，意見難以統一所致。
加之四中全會召開前，官媒刊發習近平的舊文稱，中共作為一個大黨，要「敢於刀刃向內，防止禍起蕭牆」，暗示「敵人就在黨內」。此文調子和9月3日習近平在黨校講話58次提及「鬥爭」頗為相近。
10月中旬，習近平在尼泊爾訪問時，更是罕見放狠話「任何人企圖在中國任何地區搞分裂，結果只能是粉身碎骨」。有評論認為，習此言不僅是針對香港，更是對其黨內反習勢力的警告。
華府中國問題專家石藏山表示，習近平目前面臨中共黨內「左右派」都不滿的局面。現在中國經濟出了問題，黨內肯定有很多不滿的聲音。
不過，四中全會落幕後，官媒發布的全會公報中，鋪天蓋地歌頌其黨的領導，似乎在宣示習近平仍大權在握並沒受到問責。
但一名中國學者對BBC表示，四中公報通篇講的也是加強黨的領導——東西南北中，黨政軍民學，黨是領導一切的。經濟上的舉措基本上沒有談——基本上是在談黨建和以黨治國。是凡出現這樣的情況，一般都是有很多事情擺不平。

更讓輿論震驚的是，中共四中全會上還爆出了人命案，中央候補委員、重慶第三把手任學鋒被證實，在全會期間離奇死亡。
對於他的死因眾說紛紜，版本包括：因派系不同，與重慶市委書記陳敏爾有矛盾；在四中全會開會場地京西賓館跳樓，或涉及中共黨爭；涉及P2P貪腐曾被中紀委約談等。
公開報導顯示，任學鋒在仕途上，與中共常委張高麗、汪洋，以及中共政治局委員薄熙來，陳敏爾和孫春蘭均有交集。
阿波羅網評論員王篤然認為，任學鋒能在四中全會會場、安保重地京西賓館跳樓，更像是被跳樓，死於派系鬥爭。
公開資料顯示，任學鋒是河北邢台人，長期在天津任職。任學鋒在天津任職期間，是現政治局委員孫春蘭、已退休的前常委張高麗的副手。
王篤然分析說，也許在中南海內鬥中，習近平需要追究天津官場的腐敗。任學鋒在被重重保衛的京西賓館自殺，增添被滅口的可能性，來保護諸如張高麗這種高層。
自由亞洲電台引述熟悉重慶官場趙先生的話透露，年僅54歲的任學鋒原本是作為重要後備人才重用的，也是被當作繼黃奇帆之後，又一個懂經濟的技術型官僚。一度傳出要成重慶的接班人，其突然死亡，只能說高層權力之間又出了大事。
趙先生說，有兩個朋友告訴他，任學鋒是在京西賓館墜樓死亡的。因為他知道在這種時候選擇自殺的話，就把自己解脫掉了。

Is the Fourth Plenary Session a big event? Wang Xiaohong is also unusual for the special commander

06 Nov 2019, 03:36

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 06, 2019] Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, died bizarrely during the Fourth Plenary Session, triggering speculation that the CCP’s power to fight big things. Wang Xiaohong, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party’s public security department, also serves as the new SAR’s special agency. The Secretary of the Bureau, causing public concern. Some analysts believe that this arrangement is unusual.
Recently, the new secret service bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of the Communist Party of China announced the candidate for the director. Wang Xiaohong, deputy secretary of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and executive deputy director, also served as the director of the Secret Service. The Ministry of Public Security's official newspaper reported on the 4th that Wang Xiaohong was the first to appear as the secretary of the party committee and director of the Secret Service on the 2nd, and presided over the meeting of the special committee of the secret service bureau (expansion).
The CCP launched the reform of the public security forces last year. The Ministry of Public Security announced the status of its internal institutions for the first time in July this year. Including: special service, intelligence command, research office, inspector audit, news propaganda, food and drug crime investigation, railway public security are reorganization or new institutions.
Caixin.com said that the overwhelming majority of the newly established bureau-level institutions of the Ministry of Public Security of the Communist Party of China are not concurrently appointed by the deputy leadership of the Ministry of Public Security. Wang Xiaohong broke the post as the director of the Secret Service, causing concern.
Wang Xiaohong is Xi Jinping's old department of Fujian and is regarded as a close confidant of Xi. When he was appointed secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee, Wang Xiaohong was the deputy director of the Fuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, responsible for the safety of Xi Jinping.

It is reported that the security guards responsible for the Secret Service of the Ministry of Public Security are the ""four deputies and two highs"" among the Chinese Communist Party and state leaders (the vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, the vice chairman of the Chinese People's Congress, the vice premier of the State Council, the State Councilor, and the vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee). Chairman, President of the Supreme Court of the Chinese Communist Party, Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Procuratorate of the Communist Party of China, and foreign dignitaries.
Shi Zheng, a political commentator, said that Wang Xiaohong is in charge of the deputy national-level official guards. The future security guards may change. The Secret Service may take over. Wang is likely to take control of all deputy and national defenses, and of course A surveillance job.
Another analysis believes that the timing of this personnel arrangement is unusual, just after the Fourth Plenary Session has just ended, and that during the meeting, ""there has been a life"", or that the Fourth Plenary Session is not peaceful, the CCP’s internal power may be a big deal. Xi Jinping needs his cronies to personally take control of the life and death of the high-ranking Zhongnanhai.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been postponed for more than a year, was convened at the time when the US-China trade war struck a serious downturn in China’s economy and the anti-delivery in Hong Kong lasted for more than four months.
It is widely believed that the reason why the Fourth Plenary Session is delayed is because the top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are facing domestic and international pressures. The CCP’s internal power is fierce and opinions are difficult to unify.
In addition, before the Fourth Plenary Session, the official media published Xi Jinping’s old article saying that the CCP, as a big party, must “dare to inwardly cut the wall and prevent the evil from happening”, suggesting that “the enemy is in the party”. This tune is quite similar to the ""struggle"" mentioned by Xi Jinping in the party school on 58 September.
In mid-October, when Xi Jinping visited Nepal, it was rare to say that ""anyone is trying to split in any part of China, and the result can only be broken."" Some commentators believe that this is not only aimed at Hong Kong, but also a warning to the party's anti-reform forces.
Shi Zhanshan, an expert on Washington China, said that Xi Jinping is currently facing a dissatisfaction with the ""left and right factions"" within the Chinese Communist Party. Now that the Chinese economy has gone wrong, there must be a lot of dissatisfaction in the party.
However, after the end of the Fourth Plenary Session, in the plenary bulletin issued by the official media, the overwhelming singer of the party’s leadership seems to be claiming that Xi Jinping is still in power and not being held accountable.
However, a Chinese scholar told the BBC that the Fourth China Communiqué is also to strengthen the leadership of the party - East, West, North and South, Party, Government, Military, and People's Studies, and the party is leading everything. The economic measures are basically not talked about - basically talking about party building and partying the country. In the case of such a situation, there are generally many things that are not even.

What is even more shocking to public opinion is that the CCP’s Fourth Plenary Session also broke out the human life case. The Central Standing Committee member and Chongqing’s third-ranked Ren Xuefeng were confirmed to have died bizarrely during the plenary session.
There are different opinions on his cause of death. The version includes: due to different factions, there is a contradiction with Chen Miner, secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee; in the venue of the Fourth Plenary Session, the Jingxi Hotel jumped from the building, or involved the CCP's party struggle; the P2P corruption involved was discussed by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. Wait.
According to public reports, Ren Xuefeng has a meeting with the CPC Standing Committee members Zhang Gaoli, Wang Yang, and the Politburo members Bo Xilai, Chen Miner and Sun Chunlan.
Apollo commentator Wang Yiran believes that Ren Xuefeng can jump off the building in the venue of the Fourth Plenary Session and the security of Jingxi Hotel, more like being jumped from the building and dying from factional struggles.
According to public information, Ren Xuefeng is a native of Xingtai, Hebei Province, and has served in Tianjin for a long time. During his tenure in Tianjin, Ren Xuefeng was the deputy of the current Politburo member Sun Chunlan and the retired former Standing Committee member Zhang Gaoli.
Wang Yuran analyzed that, perhaps in Zhongnanhai, Xi Jinping needs to investigate the corruption of Tianjin officialdom. Ren Xuefeng committed suicide in the heavily defended Jingxi Hotel, adding the possibility of being smashed to protect the top level such as Zhang Gaoli.
Radio Free Asia quoted Mr. Zhao, who is familiar with Chongqing officialdom, as saying that Ren Xuefeng, who was only 54 years old, was originally used as an important reserve talent. He was also regarded as a technical bureaucrat after economics after Huang Qifan. Once it was said that the successor to become a Chongqing, its sudden death, can only say that there is a big event between the high-level power.
Mr. Zhao said that two friends told him that Ren Xuefeng died in the Jingxi Hotel. Because he knew that he chose to commit suicide at this time, he freed himself.
