【点滴网雅加达11月5日讯】中央统计局(BPS)录得，与2018年8月相比，2019年8月的公开失业率(TPT)的百分比有所下降。然而若从其数量上来看反而是增加了。中央统计局局长苏哈利延多(Suhariyanto)称，2019年8月的公开失业率为5.28%。若与2018年8月的5.34%比较，则该数字有所下降。周二，他在雅加达，中央统计局大厦称，“在最近的4年期间其趋势亦持续降低。”如果从该5.28%失业率数字来看相当于705万人。若与2018年8月的700零1000人比较的话，则该数字更高。该数量上的差异是由于劳动力指示器调查计算方法略有不同。其差异在于被调查的样本数量。苏哈利延多说，“2019年8月调查的劳动力指示器，其样本数量由20万扩大至30万。”除此之外，2019年8月的总劳动力为1亿3356万人。比2018年8月上升255万人。其中，共有1亿2651万人是被雇用的，而705万则为失业者。(xin)

[Drip Network Jakarta November 5] The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) recorded a decrease in the percentage of open unemployment (TPT) in August 2019 compared to August 2018. However, if it is in terms of its quantity, it will increase. Suhariyanto, director of the Central Bureau of Statistics, said the public unemployment rate in August 2019 was 5.28%. If compared with 5.34% in August 2018, the number has dropped. On Tuesday, he said in Jakarta, the Central Bureau of Statistics, ""The trend has continued to decline during the last four years."" If the number of unemployment is 5.28%, it is equivalent to 7.05 million. If compared with 700,000 people in August 2018, the number is higher. This difference in quantity is due to the slightly different calculation methods for the labor indicator survey. The difference is the number of samples being investigated. Suharyanto said, “The labor force indicator surveyed in August 2019 expanded its sample size from 200,000 to 300,000.” In addition, the total labor force in August 2019 was 133.56 million. It was 2.55 million more than in August 2018. Among them, a total of 128.51 million people were employed, while 7.05 million were unemployed. (xin)
