      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After yesterday’s upward move, Ethereum corrected a few points below the $186 support against the US Dollar. ETH price corrected below the $185 level, but the 100 hourly simple moving average acted as a strong support.</p>
      <p>A swing low was formed near $183 and the price recently started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/05/ethereum-eth-eyes-fresh-rally-to-200-bitcoin-up-3/">fresh increase</a>. The price gained pace and broke the $185 and $186 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a break above the $190 resistance.</p>
      <p>A new weekly high was formed near $192 and Ethereum price again corrected below $190. Besides, there was a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $183 swing low to $192 swing high.</p>
      <p>However, the previous resistance near $188 is acting as a support. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent move from the $183 swing low to $192 swing high is also near the $188 level. Lastly, yesterday’s highlighted key bullish trend line is active with support near $186 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the price is climbing higher towards the $190 and $192 resistance levels. If there is a successful break above the $192 level, Ethereum is likely to accelerate towards the $195 and $200 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if there is another dip, the price could find support near the $188 level. The main support is near the $186 and $185 levels, below which there is a risk of an extended decline towards the $180 support area.</p>

Therefore, as long as the price is above $186, there are high chances of upside continuation.
