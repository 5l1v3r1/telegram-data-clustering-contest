担心引发地震 英政府暂停用液体压裂法开采天然气

06 Nov 2019, 03:33

【中新网】近日，英国政府宣布，由于有引发地震的风险，将暂停使用极具争议的液体压裂法开采页岩天然气。据报道，商业暨能源大臣利德索姆(Andrea Leadsom)说：“在检查了近期在普雷斯顿新路区地震活动的报告之后，我们担心未来可能对当地小区造成无法接受的影响。”普雷斯顿新路区指的是，能源企业Cuadrilla在英格兰西北部兰开夏郡的开采场址。利德索姆说：“因此，我的结论是我们应该暂停在英国使用液体压裂法，这一决定立即生效。”据报道，液体压裂法被用于开采页岩天然气，通过液压压裂岩层，抽取其中的天然气。英国的北海石油与天然气监管局(OGA)近期的报告提到，目前不可能精准预测液体压裂法触发地震的可能性。英国首相约翰逊表示，他对页岩天然气的开采作业感到“非常忧虑”。根据英国国家审计部，反对开采页岩天然气的英国群众已从2013年的21%增加到40%，“大众关注液体压裂法引起的地震对环境及公共卫生的风险，以及现有环境法规的充足性”。

Worried about causing earthquakes, the British government suspended the use of liquid fracturing to extract natural gas.

[Zhongxin.com] Recently, the British government announced that it will suspend the use of controversial liquid fracturing to extract shale gas due to the risk of earthquake. According to reports, Andrea Leadsom, Minister of Commerce and Energy, said: ""After examining the recent report on the earthquake activity in the New Road area of Preston, we are worried that the future may have an unacceptable impact on the local community."" The Preston New Road area refers to the mining site of the energy company Cuadrilla in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. Lid Som said: ""So, my conclusion is that we should suspend the use of liquid fracturing in the UK, and this decision takes effect immediately."" It is reported that liquid fracturing is used to mine shale gas through hydraulic fracturing. The rock formation extracts natural gas from it. A recent report by the UK's North Sea Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGA) mentions that it is currently impossible to accurately predict the possibility of liquid fracturing triggering an earthquake. British Prime Minister Johnson said he was ""very worried"" about the operation of shale gas. According to the UK National Audit Office, the number of British people who oppose the exploitation of shale gas has increased from 21% in 2013 to 40%. “People are concerned about the environmental and public health risks caused by liquid fracturing, as well as existing environmental regulations.
