日本央行总裁黑田东彦称 货币宽松工具不仅限于降息

06 Nov 2019, 03:03

【路透日本名古屋讯】日本央行总裁黑田东彦周二表示，该央行并未把货币宽松工具限定为只有降息一项，强调称如果需要加大刺激力度，仍有其他选项可用。日本央行上周维持货币政策不变，但调整了前瞻指引—即央行对未来货币政策的承诺--称其将维持超低利率，甚至会在必要时降息。黑田东彦称，新的前瞻指引反映了日本央行的立场，即更倾向于采取进一步宽松政策，及其“政策利率的下行偏向”。但他表示，降息只是央行宽松政策四种选择之一，其他选择包括增加资产购买及加快印钞步伐。“(新前瞻指引)并没有将额外货币宽松措施局限于降息，”黑田东彦称。“我们的理解并未改变，除了调降政策利率之外，额外宽松还有各种可能措施，”他在名古屋对企业领袖发表演说指出。中美贸易战及全球需求不振已打击了日本出口，但强劲内需缓冲了一部分影响。黑田东彦表示，全球经济增长回暖的时机，恐怕会比日本央行先前预估的推迟约半年。但他维持对日本经济的乐观看法，称经济将维持温和扩张势头，受强劲的资本支出和紧俏的就业市场推动。就业市场的良好表现正帮助家庭度过10月消费税上调的负面影响。“尽管海外经济加快增长的时机已经推迟，但我们认为日本经济不会大幅减速，”他说，暗示日本央行可能暂停加码刺激措施，除非未来的数据显示经济状况明显恶化。根据收益率曲线控制政策，日本央行承诺引导短期利率在负0.1%、10年期公债收益率在零附近。黑田东彦曾多次表示，若要进一步放松政策，日本央行将寻求推低短期至中期借款成本，同时避免超长期收益率过度下跌。他之前曾表示，全球经济增长将在今年某个时间至明年年初反弹。

Bank of Japan President Kuroda said that monetary easing tools are not limited to interest rate cuts.

06 Nov 2019, 03:03

[Reuters, Nagoya, Japan] Bank of Japan President Kuroda said on Tuesday that the central bank did not limit monetary easing to a rate cut only, stressing that other options are available if stimulus is needed. The Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy unchanged last week, but adjusted its forward-looking guidance – the central bank’s commitment to future monetary policy – that it will maintain ultra-low interest rates and even cut interest rates when necessary. Kuroda said that the new forward-looking guidance reflects the Bank of Japan’s position that it is more inclined to adopt further easing policies and its “downward bias in policy interest rates”. But he said that interest rate cuts are just one of the four options for central bank easing, and other options include increasing asset purchases and accelerating the pace of printing. ""(The new forward-looking guidelines) did not limit the additional monetary easing measures to interest rate cuts,"" Kuroda said. ""Our understanding has not changed. In addition to lowering the policy rate, there are various possible measures for additional easing,"" he said in a statement to business leaders in Nagoya. Sino-US trade wars and sluggish global demand have hit Japan's exports, but strong domestic demand has cushioned some of the impact. Kuroda said that the timing of global economic growth is likely to be delayed by about half a year from the Bank of Japan’s previous estimate. However, he maintains an optimistic view of the Japanese economy, saying that the economy will maintain a moderate expansion momentum, driven by strong capital expenditures and a tight job market. The good performance of the job market is helping families to survive the negative impact of the October consumption tax hike. ""Although the timing of the accelerated growth of the overseas economy has been postponed, we believe that the Japanese economy will not slow down significantly,"" he said, suggesting that the Bank of Japan may suspend the stimulus measures unless future data shows that the economic situation has deteriorated significantly. According to the yield curve control policy, the Bank of Japan promised to direct short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and 10-year bond yields near zero. Kuroda has repeatedly said that if the policy is to be further relaxed, the Bank of Japan will seek to push down the short- to medium-term borrowing costs while avoiding excessive long-term yields. He has previously said that global economic growth will rebound from some time this year to early next year.
