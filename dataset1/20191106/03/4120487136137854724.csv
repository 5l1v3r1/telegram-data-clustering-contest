监管机构:波音737MAX 或2020年第一季度在欧洲复飞

06 Nov 2019, 03:31

【中新网】当地时间4日，欧洲航空安全局(EASA)表示，停飞的波音公司737MAX机型可能于2020年第一季度恢复在欧洲的服务。EASA执行董事帕特里克(Patrick Ky)表示，尽管欧洲监管机构预计将在2020年1月批准复飞，但各国政府和航空公司还需要进行准备工作，恢复商业航班的时间可能会再推迟两个月。据报道，此前的初步调查显示，737MAX客机的“机动特性增强系统”(MCAS)存在问题，使得飞行员对飞机失去控制。波音公司对设计的程序进行了修复。相关审核主要由美国联邦航空管理局(FAA)负责，以避免传感器数据故障引发飞行系统问题，导致飞机俯冲。但欧洲航空安全局还计划在波音恢复欧洲的服务前，进行自己的检查程序，包括模拟器和飞行测试。不过，帕特里克未详细说明监管机构是否会要求对波音737MAX机型的飞行员进行额外模拟器培训。他说，只有在EASA进行包括模拟器等审查后，才能做出这个决定。

Regulatory agency: Boeing 737MAX or go-around in Europe in the first quarter of 2020

06 Nov 2019, 03:31

[Zhongxin.com] On the 4th local time, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said that the ground-off Boeing 737MAX model may resume service in Europe in the first quarter of 2020. EASA executive director Patrick Ky said that although European regulators are expected to approve a go-around in January 2020, governments and airlines will need to prepare for a two-month delay in resuming commercial flights. According to reports, previous preliminary investigations revealed that there was a problem with the 737MAX passenger aircraft's Maneuvering Enhancement System (MCAS), which caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. Boeing has fixed the design process. The relevant audit is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to avoid flight system problems caused by sensor data failures, resulting in aircraft diving. However, the European Aviation Safety Agency also plans to conduct its own inspection procedures, including simulators and flight tests, before Boeing resumes its services in Europe. However, Patrick did not specify whether the regulator would require additional simulator training for pilots of the Boeing 737MAX model. He said that this decision can only be made after EASA has conducted a review including a simulator.
