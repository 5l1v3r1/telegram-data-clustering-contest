Truck overturns, sends 2 tons of catfish onto southern Thai road (Video)
06 Nov 2019, 03:47 by Coconuts Bangkok
In a bizarre roadside scene, people were shoveling thousands of squirming live catfish from the side of a road in the Thai south.
A slippery road in Krabi province’s Khlong Thom district sent a truck onto its side Sunday to spill 2 metric tons of catfish onto the road, where multiple people – including a tween boy – got to work helping the owner return them to the truck.



The driver, only identified as a Songkhla native, told reporters that he was transporting the fish from to Phang Nga province. He said he used a huge rubber matt to line the truck bed and filled it with water to keep the fish alive during transport.
He said the road where the accident occurred was extremely slippery, making him lose control and overturn – turning the road into a writhing mass of asphyxiating fish.
That was when by-standers rushed in to help scoop the fish back into a plastic container and then into the truck again. 
Unlike the great beer spill of January, when truck dumped thousands of cans of Leo beer in Phuket, it seemed these Good Samaritans were not helping for the sake of some free catfish.

At the end of a clip from the scene, the truck can be seen on its wheels again. With most of the fish back in its bed, local municipal workers helped fill it with water again and hosed the street to wash away, what can only be assumed was a fragrant, fishy smell.
