【搞懂承攬僱傭】勞工打官司費時傷財　明年新法上路解決爭議更便利
06 Nov 2019, 03:46 by 劉以親, 董孟航
根據勞動部統計，每年約有2萬5,000件勞動爭議案件，以工資爭議、給付資遣費、給付退休金爭議為大宗，明年1月1日《勞動事件法》上路後，將有助於勞工爭取相關權益。
2012年，時任前鴻海新綠數事業群總經理謝冠宏，因為祕書填錯假單日期，在飛機上接到董事長郭台銘電話要求下機開會，但機艙門已經關閉，郭董一句：「如果沒有回來，就再也不用回來了！」謝冠宏隨即被以曠職解僱。
事後謝冠宏向法院提出「確認僱傭關係存在」之訴，主張鴻海是非法解僱，求償資遣費、工作獎金及股票，但鴻海否認，並強調謝冠宏是高階經理人，上下班不必打卡，手下有逾萬名的台陸籍員工，雙方是委任關係，不適用《勞基法》。
不過，法官認為謝冠宏須服從公司權威，因而認定雙方是僱傭關係，今年4月最高法院判鴻海敗訴，賠付150萬元資遣費與235張鴻海股票，換算市值超過2000萬元。
過去像這樣在民事法庭提出「確認僱傭關係存在」之訴，對勞工而言，可以說是一場不對等的消耗戰，因為訴訟期間可能漫長，還要持續投入時間跟金錢打官司，最終多數勞工都不敵資方的強勢資源而選擇放棄。
不過，明年1月1日《勞動事件法》將上路，幾項改革包括將設置勞動專業法庭、增設勞動調解程序，以及舉證責任及補償金規定，都對勞工有很大幫助。
例如，當勞資爭議發生，在進入訴訟程序前增加法院調解程序，由審理法官擔任必要調解人，如果調解不成，進入訴訟只進行一次辯論，並於6個月內做出判決，可以加速解決爭議。
再則，各法院設置勞動專業法庭，過去打官司一定要到公司所在地法院，新法上路後，也可以在勞務提供地的勞動法庭進行訴訟，避免遇到勞工在台中分公司上班，而公司設立在台北，大大降低光是打官司就要舟車勞頓，花錢又費時的障礙。

[Understanding the employment of employment] Labor costs the lawsuit when it costs money. It is more convenient to solve the dispute on the new law next year.
06 Nov 2019, 03:46 by Liu Yiqin, Dong Menghang
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Labor, there are about 25,000 labor dispute cases each year. The disputes over wage disputes, payment of severance pay, and pension payments are large. After the Labor Law of January 1 next year, it will help laborers. Strive for relevant rights and interests.
In 2012, Xie Guanhong, the former general manager of the former Honghai New Green Number Business Group, received the wrong date from the secretary and received a phone call from the chairman Guo Taiming on the plane. The cabin door was closed. Guo Dong said: ""If there is no When you come back, you don't have to come back anymore!"" Xie Guanhong was immediately dismissed from office.
Afterwards, Xie Guanhong filed a lawsuit with the court to ""confirm the existence of the employment relationship"", claiming that Hon Hai was illegally dismissed, claiming severance pay, work bonuses and stocks, but Hon Hai denied, and stressed that Xie Guanhong is a high-ranking manager who does not have to punch in and out of work. 10,000 Taiwanese employees, the two sides are appointed, and the ""Laoji Law"" is not applicable.
However, the judge believes that Xie Guanhong must obey the authority of the company, and thus the two parties are considered to be in employment. In April this year, the Supreme Court sentenced Hon Hai to lose the case, paying 1.5 million yuan in severance pay and 235 Hon Hai shares, and the market value exceeded 20 million yuan.
In the past, in the civil court, the ""confirmation of the existence of the employment relationship"" was raised. For the laborer, it can be said that it is an unequal war of attrition, because the litigation period may be long, and it is necessary to continue investing time and money to fight the lawsuit. Do not give up the strong resources of the employer and choose to give up.
However, the Labor Accident Law will be on the road on January 1 next year. Several reforms, including the establishment of labor professional courts, the establishment of labor mediation procedures, and the burden of proof and compensation provisions, are all very helpful to the workers.
For example, when a labor dispute occurs, the court mediation procedure is added before entering the proceedings, and the trial judge acts as the necessary mediator. If the mediation fails, the entry into the lawsuit only conducts a debate and the judgment is made within 6 months, which can speed up the resolution of the dispute. .
In addition, the courts set up labor professional courts. In the past, the lawsuit must go to the court where the company is located. After the new law is on the road, it can also be litigated in the labor court of the labor service provider to avoid the labor in the Taichung branch, and the company is established. Taipei, greatly reducing the light is a lawsuit that will take the boat to work, spending money and time-consuming obstacles.
