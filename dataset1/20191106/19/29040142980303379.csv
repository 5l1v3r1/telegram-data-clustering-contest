Ditch the wires with these Pixel 4 charging pads

06 Nov 2019, 19:30

Best Wireless Charging Pads for Pixel 4 Android Central 2019
Wireless charging on Pixel phones has only been around for a year now, and after being hobbled on the Pixel 3, Google has answered our prays and made the Pixel 4 more widely compatible with fast Qi charging by supporting 10W charging on far more chargers through the Extended Power Profile. Whether you prefer vertical stands that you can use with Motion Sense's swift face unlocking and flat pads, there's ample options now for the Pixel 4.


Futureproof: Anker PowerWave 15


Looking slick: Yootech 15W Wireless Charger with Cooling Fan


Fancy photo slideshow: Google Pixel Stand


Thin but powerful: Choetech USB-C 15W Wireless Charger


Outfit your home: Yootech 10W Wireless Charging Pad Stand Bundle


At home and on the go: Samsung Wireless Charger Portable Battery








Futureproof: Anker PowerWave 15
Staff pick
This charger is a little more expensive than the PowerWave Stand, but it supports 15W wireless charging, which is higher than the 11W max the Pixel 4 can take but means that it should charge your Pixel 4 and whatever phone comes after it at full speed.

$42 at Amazon







Looking slick: Yootech 15W Wireless Charger with Cooling Fan
This 15W stand is more condusive to sitting next to your laptop at your desk or keeping your phone propped up in the kitchen while you're working on that new recipe, and the built-in fan should help keep things cool while your Pixel 4 charges.

$25 at Amazon







Fancy photo slideshow: Google Pixel Stand
This was the only charger for the Pixel 3 that would charge at top speed, but the Pixel 4 isn't limited anymore. If you want the Google look, though, the Pixel Stand is designed for the Pixel line, looks quite clean in white, and has a special slideshow mode when docked.

$80 at Amazon







Thin but powerful: Choetech USB-C 15W Wireless Charger
Choetech's got a couple of wireless pads that should charge the Pixel 4 at top speed, but this model is the best-looking of the bunch, as well as being one of the thinner Qi pads around if you like to bring your Qi pad on trips. It also comes with an AC adapter.

$30 at Amazon







Outfit your home: Yootech 10W Wireless Charging Pad Stand Bundle
This bundle features a 10W pad and a 10W stand, allowing you to jumpstart your Qi charger collection without breaking the bank. Just keep in mind to reach top speed these pads need to be powered by a QC3.0 wall adapter.

$27 at Amazon







At home and on the go: Samsung Wireless Charger Portable Battery
When it's at home, this phone-sized charging pad works just like any other, but when you unplug it, it turns into a 10,000mAh power bank that you can use to charge your Pixel 4 wirelessly at 5W or with a standard USB-C cable at 15W. It's two wireless chargers in one, and really, does it get much better than that?

$37 at Amazon

Wireless adaptability is here!
FINALLY! We can use more regular Qi chargers for fast charging the Pixel 4! This is awesome for so many reasons but most especially because that means we can save some money buying chargers that aren't 80 bucks like the Pixel Stand! The Anker PowerWave 15 is compact, affordable while still supporting the EPP profile that the Pixel 4 requires, and Anker is a name we trust to the moon and back. You'll want to make sure you're using a 24W Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 or 3.0 wall charger with the PowerWave 15 to get the higher charging profiles.
If you're looking for a stand but don't feel like paying big bucks for Google's version, Yootech's 15W stand is a great alternative that hould be able to fast-charger just about every phone your throw at it, and the built-in fan should keep things from overheating when you're charging for longer periods. I like stands for the living room and the office were I can perch my phone next to my laptop or my drink coaster, whereas flat pads are great for the bedroom where they'll keep the screen from shining into your face if your get a notification in the middle of the night.
As a note: the Pixel 4 supports EPP, but finding EPP Qi chargers can still be somewhat few and far between at the moment, hence the appearance of some 5W chargers in this roundup. I'd rather steer you towards higher-quality lower-speed chargers than no-name chargers that I don't have confidence in, but expect to see more chargers added as we can verify that they work with the Pixel 4.
