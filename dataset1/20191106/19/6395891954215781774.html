      <p><b>AKRON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - The U.S. Supreme Court says it won't consider an appeal filed by a former Ohio police officer who is seeking a new trial for the 1997 slaying of his ex-wife.</p>
      <p>The court's Monday decision marked the latest setback for former Akron officer Douglas Prade, who is serving life in prison. His ex-wife, Dr. Margo Prade, was shot and killed.</p>
      <p>The Ohio Supreme Court last year upheld a court ruling overturning a judge's decision that led to Prade's release from prison.</p>
      <p>That judge exonerated Prade in 2013 after experts testified that male DNA from a bite mark found on Dr. Prade's lab coat wasn't his.</p>
      <p>Prade was sent back to prison after prosecutors successfully appealed the ruling.</p>
      <p>Prade's attorneys told the Akron Beacon Journal they're considering other appeal options and continue to believe in Prade's innocence.</p>
