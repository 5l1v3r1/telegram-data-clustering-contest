【首置按揭】按揭新政下壓測新玩法 上車客買樓必睇｜子非魚

上文月供貴725元！貨比三家轉按揀中小行提到，在按揭保險新政策下，首置客承造首置按揭可獲豁免按揭保險公司壓力測試，但銀行未必跟隨，在某些情況仍會要求客戶進行。

首置按揭壓測中的每月供款與入息比率（DSR）上限要求，較以往亦有些改變，不過由於細則較為含糊，筆者疏理清楚後，在此文詳細闡釋。要留意，首置定義不是第一次買樓，而是申請按揭時沒有住宅或按揭在身。根據按證公司指引，首置客申請高達8至9成高成數按揭的首置按揭可免壓測，不過每月供款仍然不能超過月入50%，簡單而言，月入5萬元的話，供款上限為2.5萬元。如果借款人入息不足，需要擔保人幫忙，而擔保人有按揭在身，不論是住宅、車位、工商物業，都需要進行壓測；如果借款人不需要擔保人，但自己有其他按揭在身，壓測亦有必要進行。若果物業使用加按財技「甩名」及「加名」，以1,000萬元物業為例，可以借盡8成，但這種操作亦需要壓測；把發展商一按或二按轉按到銀行，可享新例下的高成數按揭及低按息，亦逃不過壓測命運。
首置按揭放寬入息要求
新例下壓測有新玩法。首先，若果借款人及擔保人沒有按揭在身，壓測前及壓測後DSR上限分別為50%及60%。以實際按息2.625%為例，每月供款不能超過入息50%；壓測下利息升3厘，即按息5.625%，則不能超過60%。舊例下，9成按揭上限分別為45%及55%，因此，新例實際放寬了9成按揭收入要求。
舉一個具體例子。首置客Jessica每月入息6.5萬元，買入一層800萬元物業並敍做8成按揭的首置按揭，按息2.625%，還款期30年。根據按揭計算機，640萬元貸款額，每月供款為25,706元，佔月入僅39.5%，低於50%上限，順利過關。壓測下，以5.625%按息計算，每月供款為36,842元，佔月入56.7%，低於60%上限，同樣成功通過。即使Jessica遭老闆減人工，月入6.5萬元跌至5.2萬元，上述物業每月供款則佔收入為49%，仍然勉強通過監管機構要求（須低於50%）；惟壓測後，每月供款則佔月入高達71%，則明顯闖關失敗（須低於60%），這個時候，Jessica需要找一間跟足按證公司政策，容許免壓測的銀行，以獲得按揭貸款。
非首置客DSR更嚴
不過，若果借款人本身有樓，或擔保人有按揭在身呢？按證公司本身文件寫得含糊，筆者親自打去求證，獲得以下答案：一、樓價800萬元以下，按揭成數7成或以下，壓測前及壓測後DSR上限分別為40%及50%；7成以上，上限分別為35%及45%；二、樓價800萬元以上，按揭成數6成或以下，DSR上限分別為40%及50%；6成以上為35%及45%。假設Jessica非首置客，有按揭在身，根據她月入6.5萬元，買入800萬元住宅並借8成按揭之例子，其壓測後結果為供款佔月入近56.7%，超出壓測下所設定的45%上限，未能過關，除非添加擔保人。今回按揭新例還有一個甚為諷刺之處，若果業主借6成或以下按揭，由於不需要按揭保險，銀行一定要業主通過壓力測試。那麼，如果業主有4成首期，但入息不足夠通過壓測，便會鋌而走險，借盡8成至9成，就可以避過壓測要求。


若果物業使用加按財技「甩名」及「加名」，以1,000萬元物業為例，可以借盡8成，但這種操作亦需要壓測。

[First mortgage] Mortgage New Deal under pressure to test new gameplay
06 Nov 2019, 19:34 by Zi Feiyu
The above month is 725 yuan! Compared with the three small and medium-sized companies, under the new mortgage insurance policy, the first mortgage-based mortgage can be exempted from the mortgage insurance company's stress test, but the bank may not follow, and in some cases, customers will still be required to conduct it.
Written by: Non-Fish | Photo: New Media Reference Room
The monthly contribution and income ratio (DSR) cap requirement in the first mortgage test is somewhat different from the previous one. However, since the rules are vague, the author has explained it in detail in this article. It should be noted that the first definition is not to buy a building for the first time, but to apply for a mortgage without a home or mortgage. According to the guidelines of the company, the first mortgage for the first-time customer application of up to 8 to 90% of the high-value mortgages is exempt from pressure measurement, but the monthly contribution can still not exceed 50% of the monthly income. In short, if the monthly income is 50,000 yuan. The maximum contribution is 25,000 yuan. If the borrower has insufficient income, the guarantor is required to help, and the guarantor has a mortgage, whether it is a house, a parking space or a commercial property. If the borrower does not need a guarantor, he has other mortgages. Pressure measurement is also necessary. If the property is used in accordance with the financial technology ""name"" and ""additional name"", for example, a property of $10 million can be borrowed 80%. However, this operation also requires pressure testing; By pressing the bank, you can enjoy the high number of mortgages and low interest rates under the new case, and you can't escape the fate of pressure measurement.
First mortgage ease of income requirements
There is a new way to play the new test. First, if the borrower and the guarantor are not mortgaged, the upper limit of the DSR before and after the pressure test is 50% and 60% respectively. Taking the actual interest rate of 2.625% as an example, the monthly contribution cannot exceed 50% of the income; under the pressure test, the interest rate rises by 3%, that is, 5.625% of the interest rate, but not more than 60%. Under the old example, the 90% mortgage ceiling was 45% and 55% respectively. Therefore, the new case actually relaxed the 90% mortgage income requirement.
Give a concrete example. The first home Jessica has a monthly income of 65,000 yuan, buys a property of 8 million yuan and sells the first mortgage of 80% mortgage, with a coupon of 2.625% and a repayment period of 30 years. According to the mortgage computer, the loan amount of 6.4 million yuan, the monthly contribution is 25,706 yuan, accounting for only 39.5% of the monthly income, below the 50% ceiling, successfully passed. Under pressure test, the monthly contribution is calculated at 5.625%, and the monthly contribution is 36,842 yuan, accounting for 56.7% of the monthly income, which is lower than the upper limit of 60%. Even if Jessica was reduced by the boss, the monthly income fell to 52,000 yuan, and the monthly contribution of the above property accounted for 49% of the income. It still barely passed the requirements of the regulatory authorities (below 50%); Monthly contributions account for up to 71% of monthly income, which is clearly a failure (less than 60%). At this time, Jessica needs to find a policy to follow the testimony company, allowing banks to be exempt from pressure to obtain mortgage loans. .
Non-first-time passenger DSR is stricter
However, if the borrower has a building, or if the guarantor has a mortgage? According to the document of the company itself, the author wrote the certificate and obtained the following answers: First, the property price is less than 8 million yuan, the mortgage number is 70% or less, and the DSR upper limit is 40% and 50% before and after the pressure measurement. %; 70% or more, the upper limit is 35% and 45% respectively; Second, the property price is more than 8 million yuan, the mortgage number is 60% or less, the DSR upper limit is 40% and 50% respectively; 60% or more is 35% and 45% . Suppose Jessica is not the first customer, there is a mortgage, according to her monthly income of 65,000 yuan, buy 8 million yuan of housing and borrow 80% of the mortgage example, the result of the pressure test is about 56.7% of the monthly contribution, exceeding The 45% upper limit set under pressure is not passed unless a guarantor is added. There is another irony in this new mortgage case. If the owner borrows 60% or less, the bank must pass the stress test because the mortgage insurance is not needed. Then, if the owner has 40% of the first period, but the income is not enough to pass the pressure test, then he will take risks and borrow 80% to 90% to avoid the pressure test requirements.


If the property is used in accordance with the financial technology ""name"" and ""additional name"", for example, a property of $10 million can be borrowed 80%, but this operation also requires pressure test.
