      <h1>Sophia the Robot Knows About Cryptocurrencies but Does Not Use Them yet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:49:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>The humanoid robot named Sophia returned to the Web Summit stage, where she fielded questions from participants and journalists, including inquiries about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. </p>
      <p>On Nov. 6, Sophia addressed the room at the latest edition of the Web <a href="https://websummit.com/schedule">Summit</a> in Lisbon, Portugal, where she talked about artificial and robotic intelligence while answering questions on a range of topics.</p>
      <p>Sophia, who will turn four years old in February and who was inspired by the looks of actress Audrey Hepburn, was asked if she had an opinion on blockchain, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), and cryptocurrencies. She answered:</p>
      <blockquote>“I know what cryptocurrencies are, but I do not use them yet myself. I don’t use money at all.”</blockquote>
      <p>Unlike previous years, the robot did not make big statements about “machine superiority” or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0_DPi0PmF0">predictions</a> that “robots will take over the world,” but did explain to the audience how artificial intelligence works, while assuring the public that robot supremacy is still far from happening.</p>
      <p>Sophia is one of <a href="https://www.eldiario.es/tecnologia/Sophia-Phil-estrellas-Web-Summit_0_960654793.html">several</a> humanized robots created by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics, and is powered by artificial intelligence technology and features lightweight polymer plastic called “frubber” (a combination of “face” and “rubber”).</p>
      <h3>Sophia’s developers partner with blockchain agricultural data firm</h3>
      <p>In January, the decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) firm SingularityNET <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-devs-behind-robot-sophia-partner-with-blockchain-agricultural-data-firm">announced</a> a partnership with agriculture-focused blockchain startup Hara to use blockchain to provide Indonesian farmers with useful data like grain price, soil quality and land ownership details.</p>
      <p>SingularityNET gained global attention as the technology behind Sophia the robot, developed by Hanson Robotics. The robotics firm’s chief scientist, Ben Goertzel, is also SingularityNET’s founder and CEO.</p>
