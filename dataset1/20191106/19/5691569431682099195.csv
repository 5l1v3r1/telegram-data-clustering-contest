Tara O'Shea, Rebecca Moore and Carlos Souza on NextGenMap and forest monitoring

06 Nov 2019, 19:20




On a panel moderated by Tara O'Shea (Planet), Rebecca Moore (Google) and Carlos Souza (Imazon) converse about NextGenMap's ability to revolutionize our abilities to monitor forests. Historically, monitoring forests and land-use change has involved a compromise between the resolution and frequency of available satellite images and limited computing capacity for analysis. Recent developments in satellite imagery, machine learning and land use classification offer new opportunities to disrupt these limitations. NexGenMap is an R&D effort to leverage these developments to monitor forests and land use to sustain our world's most important terrestrial carbon sinks.
