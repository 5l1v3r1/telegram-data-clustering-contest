      <p>“<i>The domestic two-wheeler industry has been passing through a time of volatility, with market demand still continuing to be sluggish. Notwithstanding these challenges, Hero MotoCorp – and indeed the entire industry – is gearing up for the migration to the new emission norms ahead of the mandatory deadline of April 1, 2020. At a time such as this, it is prudent for us to prioritise our resources towards meeting business objectives for the benefit of our customers and other stakeholders</i>”, a statement from Hero MotoCorp read.</p>
      <p>It looks like the manufacturer has certainly directed its resources in the right direction, and has produced a BS6-compliant motorcycle way ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline. Currently, Hero’s lineup includes 14 motorcycles and 6 scooters, all of which are BS4-compliant.</p>
      <p>Hero also showcased its Xtreme 1.R concept today, at the ongoing 2019 Milan Motorcycle Show (EICMA). The bike uses a 160cc single-cylinder engine, and a production model based on the same could make its way to the Indian market as well. The bike weighs less than 140 kg, and gets LED headlamps and tail lamps.</p>
      <p>Apart from the Xtreme 1.R, Hero has also unveiled the Euro 5-compliant versions of the Hunk 200S (sold as Xtreme 200S in India), and the Glamour 125 for the European markets at the event.</p>
