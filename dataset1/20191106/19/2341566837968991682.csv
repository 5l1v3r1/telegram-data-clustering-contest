美Uber自駕車撞死人 報告：沒有辨識出違規行人

（中央社紐約5日綜合外電報導）美國亞利桑那州去年3月發生優步（Uber）自駕車撞死婦女事件，美國國家運輸安全委員會今天表示，當時這名女子違規穿越馬路，自駕車系統沒有辨認出她是行人。
法新社報導，美國國家運輸安全委員會（National Transportation Safety Board）聲明指出，這名女子「在沒有斑馬線的地方過街；系統設計沒有將亂穿越馬路的行人考量進去」。
國家運輸安全委員會在初步報告中說，委員會已經判定，這名49歲的女子晚間於鳳凰城（Phoenix）郊區坦佩（Tempe）牽著腳踏車過街，車子軟體在撞上女子的近6秒鐘前發現她。



根據這份最新報告，自駕車系統沒有時間「將她歸類為行人」，以為她是物體。委員會將於19日舉行聽證會。
撞擊前大約1.2秒，在軟體判定即將發生碰撞時，軟體不讓車子做出「極端的剎車或轉向動作」，以降低車子蛇行的可能性。
然而，軟體啟動減速計畫時，自駕車曾向操控者發出聲音警訊。
2018年3月車禍發生後，Uber暫停美國所有地點的自動駕駛測試，但數個月後又恢復測試計畫。
Uber已向國家運輸安全委員會保證，自駕車的新技術將在類似情況中正確辨識出行人，在撞擊前超過4秒鐘啟動剎車系統。
報告還指出，除了亞利桑那州車禍外，2016年9月到2018年3月間，Uber自駕模式測試車涉及37起事故。（譯者：張曉雯/核稿：陳彥鈞）1081106

Uber self-driving car hit the dead man Report: no illegal pedestrians were identified

(Central News Agency, New York, 5th, comprehensive foreign news report) U.S. U.S. U.S. self-driving car crashed into a woman in March last year. The National Transportation Safety Board said today that the woman violated the road and the self-driving system did not recognize it. She is a pedestrian.
Agence France-Presse reported that the National Transportation Safety Board stated that the woman ""crossed the street without a zebra crossing; the system design did not consider pedestrians crossing the road.""
The National Transportation Safety Board said in a preliminary report that the committee had determined that the 49-year-old woman had been riding a bicycle through the street in Tempe, a suburb of Phoenix, and that the car was hitting the woman nearly 6 seconds ago. Found her.



According to the latest report, the self-driving system does not have time to ""classify her as a pedestrian"" and think she is an object. The committee will hold a hearing on the 19th.
About 1.2 seconds before the impact, when the software determines that the collision is about to occur, the software does not allow the car to make ""extreme braking or steering action"" to reduce the possibility of the car snake.
However, when the software started the deceleration plan, the self-driving car had an audible warning to the controller.
After the car accident in March 2018, Uber suspended the autopilot test at all locations in the United States, but resumed the test program a few months later.
Uber has assured the National Transportation Safety Board that the new technology for self-driving will correctly identify pedestrians in similar situations and activate the brake system more than 4 seconds before the impact.
The report also pointed out that in addition to the Arizona car accident, between September 2016 and March 2018, the Uber self-driving model test vehicle involved 37 accidents. (Translator: Zhang Xiaowen / Approved: Chen Yanzhen) 1081106
