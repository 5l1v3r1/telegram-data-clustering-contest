      <h1>iOS 14 concept teases what a new call screen UI, Split View, complications, and more could look like on iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:47:17+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>A new iOS 14 concept shared today visualizes what some highly requested features from Apple customers could look like on iPhone including a new call screen UI that doesn’t take over the entire screen, Split View and drag and drop support, a truly customizable Home screen, always-on display with complications, and more.</p>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa19cfJKk6A">the Hacker 34</a> shared their well-done concept that kicks off with a look at refreshed icons for Apple’s first-party apps. After that, we get a look at a much more elegant call screen UI using a card design that drops down from the top of the screen.</p>
      <p>Other highlights imagine how Split View and drag and drop support on <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">iPhone</a> could look while an always-on display comes to the smartphone with complications like Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>There’s also a peek at how a fully customizable Home screen (something that’s been available by jailbreaking or with other workarounds) would look in an official iOS build.</p>
      <p>The full concept is about a minute and a half long and is definitely a fun watch!</p>
