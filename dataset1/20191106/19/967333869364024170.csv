According to media reports, the school authorities and local police received two calls about a bomb in the facility and a ""group of several armed individuals,"" at around 15:30 pm local time.
Upon the arrival, the police placed a cordon around the school, while students of the two classes weren't able to leave the building after the evacuation was declared.



Later on, local authorities said via Twitter that the bomb alert was false and slammed those responsible for it.



​In June, a hostage incident occurred in the Conde-sur-Sarthe prison in the northwestern French department of Orne. A 35-year old prisoner kept a warden hostage, using a self-made weapon. The prisoner had been demanding to be relocated to another facility.
