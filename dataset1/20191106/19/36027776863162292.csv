Toshkent metropoliteni — bekatlarining nomi juda ko‘p o‘zgargan yerosti saroyi

06 Nov 2019, 19:19

Bundan 42 yil avval — 1977-yilning 6-noyabr kuni Toshkent metropolitenining dastlabki to‘qqiz stansiyasi — “Sobir Rahimov”, “Chilonzor”, “SSSRning 50 yilligi”, “Komsomollar” (“Komsomolskaya”), “Hamza”, “Xalqlar do‘stligi”, “Paxtakor”, “Lenin maydoni” va “Oktabr revolyutsiyasi” bekatlari foydalanishga topshirilgan. Bugungacha bu ro‘yxatdagi nomlardan faqat ikkitasi — “Chilonzor” va “Paxtakor” o‘zgarmagan xolos, ba’zi bekatlarning nomi esa so‘nggi 30 yil ichida bir emas, bir necha bor o‘zgardi.

Toshkent metrosining “Chilonzor” va “O‘zbekiston” yo‘nalishlaridagi bekat nomlari o‘zgartirilganini qaysidir ma’noda tushunsa bo‘ladi — eski zamonning eski mafkuralariga hurmat belgisi o‘laroq qo‘yilgan aksariyat nomlar yangi zamon talablariga javob bera olmay qolgandir. Lekin Mustaqillik yillarida qurilib, foydalanishga topshirilgan “Yunusobod” yo‘lidagi bekatlarni ham “nom o‘zgartirish” epidemiyasidan asrab qolib bo‘lmaganini, kim bilsin, mamlakatda bundan bir necha yil avval kuzatilgan turg‘unlik ramzi sifatida qabul qilmoq kerakdir, balki.

“Chilonzor” yo‘nalishi
Hozirda Toshkent metrosining “Chilonzor” liniyasida 12 ta bekat ishlab turibdi, yaqin kelajakda ularning soni kamida ikkitaga ko‘payishi mumkin (mamlakat rahbariyati liniyani TTZ avtoshohbekatiga qadar olib borish niyatida). Boshqa tomondan — “Sergeli” yo‘nalishi deb aytilayotgan yangi, kamida olti bekatdan iborat yer usti metro yo‘li ham aslida “Chilonzor”ning davomi. Lekin hozir gap shu bugun ishlab turgan 12 bekat haqida.

1977-yildan beri ulardan faqat to‘rttasining nomi o‘zgarmagan, xolos. Bular — “Chilonzor”, “Paxtakor”, “Hamid Olimjon” va “Pushkin”. “Chilonzor” bekati Chilonzor tumanining tarixan Chilonzor deb atalgan qismida joylashgan, bu joylarning nomi o‘zgarishidan darak yo‘q va o‘zgarsa ham jamoatchilik buni hazm qila olmasa kerak. “Paxtakor” haqida ham shu gap — bekatdan chiqishingiz bilan shu nomli futbol klubi o‘ynaydigan stadion qarshingizdan chiqadi (va milliarder Alisher Usmonovga ishonadigan bo‘lsak, bundan keyin ham shunday bo‘ladi).
“Hamid Olimjon” va “Pushkin” haqida esa bir narsa deyish qiyin — qandaydir o‘z nomiga loyiq emasdek. Yaqin-yaqingacha “Hamid Olimjon” bekatidan chiqqan yo‘lovchi Hamid Olimjon haykalini ko‘rardi (hozir haykal Milliy bog‘dagi Adiblar xiyobonida, Zulfiya monumenti bilan yonma-yon). “Pushkin” haqida ham shu gap — bekat sizni nomi bir asrdan ziyod Pushkin bo‘lgan ko‘chaga olib chiqardi (1899-yildan beri nomi Pushkin bo‘lgan ko‘cha 2008-yilda Mustaqillik nomini olgan), ko‘cha markazida esa Pushkinning haykali bo‘lardi (hozir u Bobur—Rustaveli chorrahasidagi xiyobonda).
“Chilonzor” yo‘lida nom o‘zgartirish bo‘yicha rekordchi bekatlar bor. Masalan, “Milliy bog‘”. U 1992-yil mayigacha “Komsomollar” deb atalgan (mantiqan to‘g‘ri — bekat xalq orasida hali ham “Komsomolskaya ozero” deb ataladigan ko‘li bor Komsomollar bog‘iga olib borgan). So‘ng “Yoshlik” nomini olgan. 2006-yil fevralida esa poyezd shu bekatga kelganida metro mashinistlari uni “Milliy bog‘” deb e’lon qila boshladi.

“Amir Temur xiyoboni”ning “taqdiri” ham shunaqaroq — 1992-yil mayiga qadar “Oktabr revolyutsiyasi” deb atalgan bekat 1993-yil avgustigacha vaqtincha “Markaziy xiyobon” bo‘lib turdi, keyin hozirgi — “Amir Temur xiyoboni” nomini oldi. Bekat nomi bilan birga uning tashqi ko‘rinishi ham qisman o‘zgargan — bekat platformalari boshidagi barelyeflar (masalan, Turkistonlik 14 komissar sharafiga o‘rnatilgan haykalning barelyefi) olib tashlangan.
Umuman olganda, “Chilonzor” yo‘lida nomi eng birinchi bo‘lib o‘zgartirilgan bekat — “Mustaqillik maydoni”. U 1991-yil noyabriga qadar “Lenin maydoni” deb atalgan (chunki bekat ustidagi maydon nomi ham Mustaqillik emas, Lenin edi). 1992-yil may oyida esa “Komsomollar” va “Oktabr revolyutsiyasi” bilan birga “SSSRning 50 yilligi” stansiyasi nomi ham o‘zgargan — u hozirgacha “Mirzo Ulug‘bek” deb ataladi. 1997-yilda “Maksim Gorkiy” bekatining nomi “Buyuk Ipak yo‘li” deb, 2008-yilda “Xalqlar do‘stligi” bekatining nomi “Bunyodkor” deb, 2010-yilda “Sobir Rahimov” bekatining nomi “Olmazor” deb, 2015-yilda esa “Hamza” stansiyasining nomi “Novza” deb o‘zgartirildi. 2018-yilda “tarixiy haqiqatni qaror toptirish maqsadida”da “Bunyodkor” bekatining nomi yana “Xalqlar do‘stligi”ga qaytarildi, lekin qolgan stansiyalarga nisbatan, mabodo ularning nomi yana o‘zgarmasa, bu “tarixiy haqiqat” ortiq qo‘llanilmasa kerak.

Shu o‘rinda yana bir mulohaza. “Olmazor” bekatiga tushsangiz, mavzuli qilib bezatilgan ustunlarda avtomat ko‘targan askar, motamsaro ona siymolarini ko‘rasiz — bularning olmaga nima daxli bor? “Novza” metrosiga “Novza” masjidi tarafdan tushsangiz, negadir sizga paranji yechgan ayollar va bolalarga harf o‘rgatayotgan Hamza qarab turadi. “Buyuk Ipak yo‘li”da ham shu ahvol — bekatdan chiqib ketaverishingizda ko‘kragini quchgan odam barelyefni ko‘rasiz. “Maksim Gorkiy” nomli bekat uchun yaxshi barelyef bu, albatta — yuragini bag‘ridan sug‘urib olib, uni zulmatdagilarga chiroq qilgan Danko rus adibining mashhur qahramoni. Lekin uning Buyuk Ipak yo‘liga qanday aloqasi borligi fanga noma’lum.
“O‘zbekiston” yo‘nalishi
1984—1991-yillarda qurilib, foydalanishga topshirilgan yo‘nalishda hozircha 11 ta bekat bo‘lib, ulardan uchtasining nomi o‘zgargan (hozircha). Bular — “Kosmonavtlar”, “Mashinasozlar” va “Do‘stlik”. “Kosmonavtlar” va “Mashinasozlar” 1992-yil mayiga qadar mos ravishda “Kosmonavtlar prospekti” va “Tashselmash” deb atalgan. “Do‘stlik” esa 2012-yil oktabriga qadar taniqli rus uchuvchisi Valeriy Chkalov sharafiga “Chkalov” deb atalgan.
Ushbu yo‘nalish bekatlari navbatdagi nom o‘zgartirishlar xavfidan xolimi? Baxtga qarshi, Toshkent metropolitenining hech bir bekati bu tahdiddan xoli emas va istalgan vaqtda istalgan bekat qayta nomlanishi mumkin. Agar nomi o‘zgarishga birinchi galda da’vogar bekatlar ro‘yxati tuziladigan bo‘lsa, uning boshida “Mashinasozlar”, “O‘zbekiston” va “G‘afur G‘ulom” tursa kerak, ehtimol.

“Mashinasozlar”da mashinasozlikka oid deyarli hech narsa qolmagan — uni, balki, maishiy texnika ishlab chiqarishga ixtisoslashgan “milliy iftixor” sharafiga qayta nomlash kerakdir; poytaxtning markazida Siti bo‘lsa-yu, metrosida “Tashkent Siti” degan bekati bo‘lmasa — g‘alati bo‘ladi-ku; “G‘afur G‘ulom” esa xuddi “Olmazor”, “Mirzo Ulug‘bek” va “Abdulla Qodiriy” bekatlari kabi chalg‘ituvchi — “G‘afur G‘ulom” seni Toshkentning Sebzor degan dahasiga, Abdulla Qodiriy nomi bilan ataluvchi parkning shundoqqina oldiga olib chiqadi.
Xuddi shu gapni “Chilonzor” va “Yunusobod”dagi qolgan uch “chalg‘ituvchi” haqida ham aytsa bo‘ladi — “Olmazor” bekati Olmazor tumaniga emas, Chilonzorga olib boradi; “Mirzo Ulug‘bek” bekatining Mirzo Ulug‘bek tumaniga aloqasi yo‘q, u seni Chilonzordagi G‘afur G‘ulom nomidagi bog‘ va Milliy (sobiq “Bunyodkor”) stadionga olib chiqadi; “Abdulla Qodiriy” bekati esa Abdulla Qodiriy parki va haykalidan uzoqdagi Oloy bozorida joylashgan, u faqat Abdulla Qodiriy shoh ko‘chasiga yaqin, xolos.
“Yunusobod” yo‘nalishi
“Yunusobod” yo‘lining loyihasi SSSR davridayoq tayyorlangan, shuning uchun aksariyat bekatlarning loyihaviy nomlari sovetcha edi — tojik sovet shoiri Abulqosim Lohutiy sharafiga “Lohutiy” (hozirgi “Mingo‘rik”), mehnatkashlar bayrami sharafiga “1-may” (hozirgi “Yunus Rajabiy”), rus inqilobchisi Sergey Kirov sharafiga “Kirov” (hozirgi “Minor”), hozirgi “O‘zekspomarkaz” o‘rnida bo‘lgan Xalq xo‘jaligi yutuqlari ko‘rgazmasiga olib chiquvchi “VDNX” (hozirgi “Bodomzor”). Shu bilan birga, tan olib ko‘rsatib o‘tish joizki, sovet loyihachilari hozirgi “Abdulla Qodiriy” bekatini avvalboshdan “Oloy bozori”, hozirgi “Shahriston” bekatini esa “Shahriston” deb atamoqchi bo‘lgan.

Shunday qilib, 2001-yil 24-oktabrida “Yunusobod” liniyasining dastlabki olti bekati “Mingo‘rik”, “Yunus Rajabiy”, “Abdulla Qodiriy”, “Minor”, “Bodomzor”, “Habib Abdullayev” nomlari bilan foydalanishga topshirildi. Lekin, nimadir bo‘ldi-yu, Prezident Islom Karimovning farmoni bilan o‘limidan so‘ng “Buyuk xizmatlari uchun” ordeni bilan mukofotlangan buyuk o‘zbek geologi, O‘zbekiston Fanlar akademiyasining to‘rtinchi prezidenti Habib Abdullayev nomi bilan ataluvchi bekat nomi 2015-yili “Shahriston”ga o‘zgartirildi, bekatdan olimning byusti olib tashlandi. “Yunusobod”dagi yagona va hali tushunarsiz o‘zgarishsiz shu, xolos (hozircha).
Hozirda “Yunusobod” yo‘lining davomi qurilmoqda — “O‘zbekiston temir yo‘llari” kompaniyasi 2019-yil oxirigacha “Yunusobod” va “Turkiston” bekatlarini foydalanishga topshirishga va’da bergan. 2016-yilgacha “Yunusobod” yo‘nalishining “qurilayotgan bo‘lagi” sifatida metro xaritalarida ko‘rsatilgan uzuq-uzuq chiziqlar ustida “Fayzulla Xo‘jayev” nomli bekat ham bor edi, ammo 2016-yili u loyihadan chiqarib tashlandi.

Yo‘nalishning janubiy qismida Janubiy vokzalga qadar to‘rtta bekat (“Bobur”, “To‘qimachi”, “Usmon Nosir”, “Janubiy”) qurilishi eski loyihalarda ham bor, biroq bu loyiha qachon amalga oshirilishi noma’lum. Lekin bir narsani hozirdan ishonch bilan aytish mumkindir balki — “Usmon Nosir”ning nomi o‘zgarsa kerak: loyihadagi stansiyalardan biriga “Usmon Nosir” nomi qo‘yilgan vaqtda bekat joylashgan shoh ko‘cha nomi ham Usmon Nosir edi — hozir esa u ko‘cha, eski zamonlarda bo‘lganidek, Shota Rustaveli deb ataladi.
Xulosa o‘rnida
Shunday qilib, hozir Toshkent metropolitenida ishlab turgan 29 stansiyadan 12 tasining — salkam yarmining nomi o‘zgargan. Bu — juda ko‘p. Ayrim stansiyalar nomi, ta’kidlanganidek, bir necha bor almashtirilgan. Bu barcha uchun ibratli bo‘lishi kerak aslida — obyektlarga imkon qadar o‘sha obyekt joylashgan hududning tarixiy nomlarini qo‘yavergan ma’qul. Mabodo biror tarixiy shaxsning ismi yoki biror tarixiy voqeaning nomini qo‘yishga qaror qilinarkan, avvalo, bu tanlov yaxshilab muhokama qilinishi maqsadga muvofiq. Toki, ertaga yana “tarixiy haqiqatni qaror toptirish”ga zarurat bo‘lmasin.

Tashkent Underground is an underground palace that has been renamed with stops

06 Nov 2019, 19:19 PM

42 years ago - on November 6, 1977, the first nine stations of the Tashkent underground were ""Sobir Rahimov"", ""Chilanzar"", ""50th anniversary of the USSR"", ""Komsomolskaya"", ""Hamza"", Friendly ”,“ Pakhtakor ”,“ Lenin Square ”and“ October Revolution ”stations. So far only two names in this list - Chilanzar and Pakhtakor - have not changed, and some stops have changed not once but over the last 30 years.

In some ways, it is clear that the Tashkent underground stations have been renamed to ""Chilanzar"" and ""Uzbekistan"" - many of the names that have been respected by the old ideologies of the old age have not met the requirements of the modern world. However, the stops along the Yunusabad highway that were built and commissioned during the years of independence have not been spared from the so-called ""renaming"" epidemic.
Subject: Gallery: The beauty of the Tashkent underground
Chilanzar route
There are currently 12 stations on the Chilanzar line of the Tashkent underground, with their number likely to increase by at least two in the near future (the country's authorities intend to drive the line to the TTZ bus station). On the other hand, the new Sergeli route, at least six stations, is actually a continuation of Chilanzar. But this is all about the 12 bus stops that work today.

Only four of them have not changed since 1977. These are Chilanzar, Pakhtakor, Hamid Olimjon and Pushkin. The Chilanzar station is located in the historic Chilanzar district of Chilanzar district, although the name has not been renamed, and the public may not be aware of it. The same is true for Pakhtakor - when you leave the stadium you will meet the stadium playing the same football club (and if we trust billionaire Alisher Usmanov, it will be so).
As for Hamid Olimjon and Pushkin, it's hard to say anything - it's not worth its own name. Recently, a passenger from the ""Hamid Olimjon"" station saw the monument to Hamid Olimjon (now the monument is in the Alley of Literature, next to the Zulfia Monument). The same thing about ""Pushkin"" - the station takes you to a street called Pushkin for more than a century (the street Pushkin has been renamed since independence in 2008), and Pushkin's street center. It would be a statue (now in the alley at Babur-Rustaveli crossroads).
Chilanzar Road has a record-breaking station. For example, ""National Park"". It was called ""Komsomols"" until May 1992 (logically - it led people to the Komsomol's garden with a lake still known as ""Komsomolskaya azero""). He was later called Youth. And in February 2006, when the train arrived at the station, subway drivers began calling it ""National Park.""

The ""fate"" of the ""Amir Temur Park"" was the same - until October 1992, the so-called ""October Revolution"" station was temporarily named ""Central Park"" and then the current ""Amir Temur Park"". In addition to the name of the station, the appearance of the station has been partially changed - the reliefs at the head of the station platforms (such as the relief of the statue in honor of the 14 commissioners from Turkestan) have been removed.
Generally, the first renovated station on Chilanzar Road is Independence Square. It was called ""Lenin Square"" until November 1991 (because the area on the station was also Lenin, not Independence). In May 1992, along with the Komsomols and the October Revolution, the station was renamed to the 50th anniversary of the USSR - it is still called Mirzo Ulugbek. In 1997 Maxim Gorky station was named “The Great Silk Road”, in 2008 “Friendship of Peoples” station was named “Bunyodkor”, and in 2010 “Sobir Rahimov” station was named “Almazar”. In the same year, the station ""Hamza"" was renamed to ""Novza"". In 2018, the name ""Bunyodkor"" was renamed to ""Friendship of Peoples"" in order to ""establish historical facts"", but if the name was not changed, this ""historical fact"" would not be used again.

Here's another thought. When you get to the Almazar station, you will see a soldier carrying a pistol in a well-decorated pillar, a grief-stricken mother - what does this have to do with apples? As you approach the ""Novza"" subway from the ""Novza"" mosque, for some reason, Hamza looks at you as she teaches you letters to women and children who have taken off the curtain. Even on the Great Silk Road, when you get out of the station, you see a barrel-covered man with a chest. The best barrel for the station ""Maxim Gorky"" is, of course, the famous hero of the Russian writer Danko, who drew his heart and lamp to the dark. It is not known, however, how it relates to the Great Silk Road.
The direction “Uzbekistan”
Built and commissioned in 1984-1991, there are currently 11 stations, three of which have been renamed (as of now). These are Cosmonauts, Machines and Friendships. Cosmonauts and Machine Builders were known as Cosmonauts Avenue and Tashselmash until May 1992. ""Friendship"" was named ""Chkalov"" in honor of the famous Russian pilot Valeriy Chkalov until October 2012.
Are these bus stops at risk of further renaming? Unfortunately, no station in the Tashkent subway is safe from this threat and any station can be renamed at any time. If the list of stops for the renaming is first compiled, it will probably be headed by Machine Builders, Uzbekistan and Gafur Gulom.

There is almost nothing left in the ""machine-building"" - it should be renamed in honor of the ""national pride"" in the manufacture of home appliances; it would be weird to have a metropolitan city in the capital but without a metro station ""Tashkent City""; ""Ghafur Ghulam"" is as misleading as Olmazor, Mirzo Ulugbek and Abdulla Kadiri stations - ""Gafur Gulom"" is located in Tashkent's Sebzor neighborhood, known as Abdulla Kadiri. take it out to the park.
The same can be said of the other three ""distractions"" in Chilanzar and Yunusabad - the Olmazor station leads to Chilanzar, not Olmazor district; The ""Mirzo Ulugbek"" station has nothing to do with the Mirzo Ulugbek district, it will take you to the Gafur Gulom Park in Chilanzar and the National (formerly ""Bunyodkor"") stadium; The ""Abdulla Kadiri"" station is located in the Alay market, close to Abdulla Kadiri Park and monument, just near Abdulla Kadiri Avenue.
“Yunusabad” route
The design of the Yunusabad road was made during the Soviet era, so most of the stops were of Soviet origin - ""Lohuti"" (now ""Mingurik"") in honor of Tajik Soviet poet Abulkosim Lohuti, ""May 1"" in honor of the Labor Day. Rajabiy "","" Kirov ""(presently"" Minor "") in honor of Russian revolutionary Sergei Kirov,"" VDNX ""(presently"" Bodomzor ""), which takes you to the National Economic Achievement Exhibition, which is now in place of"" Uzexpocentre "". . At the same time, it is noteworthy that Soviet designers had originally intended to call the current Abdulla Kadiri station ""Aloy Market"" and the current Shahriston station ""Shahriston"".


""Shahriston"" stationPhoto: Kamil Yenikeyev / Afisha

Thus, on October 24, 2001, the first six stations of the Yunusabad line were put into operation under the names of ""Mingrik"", ""Yunus Rajabi"", ""Abdulla Kadiri"", ""Minor"", ""Bodomzor"", ""Habib Abdullayev"". However, something happened and the station was named after the great Uzbek geologist, the fourth president of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, Habib Abdullayev, who was awarded the Order of Great Service after the death of President Islam Karimov. In 2015 it was renamed to ""Shahriston"", the bust of the scientist was removed from the station. This is the only and still unexplained change in Yunusabad (for now).
The Yunusabad road is currently under construction - Uzbekistan Railways has promised to put into operation Yunusabad and Turkiston stations by the end of 2019. Until 2016, there was a station called ""Fayzulla Hojaev"" on the dashed lines shown on the subway maps as a ""construction part"" of the Yunusabad route, but in 2016 it was removed from the project.

Construction of four stations (Bobur, Tukimachi, Usman Nosir, South) to the south of the route is also underway, but it is unclear when this project will be implemented. But one thing is for sure - maybe the name of Usman Nosir is changed. One of the stations in the project was the name of Usman Nosir, where the station was located when it was named ""Usman Nosir"". The Shota Rustaveli, as in the old days, is called.
In conclusion
Thus, 12 out of 29 stations currently operating in Tashkent underground are salkam half renamed. This is too much. Some stations have been renamed several times. This should be instructive for all - it is preferable to give objects the historical names of the area where the object is located. If you choose to name a historical person or historical event, this choice should be carefully considered. Until tomorrow, there is no need to ""establish historical fact"" again.
