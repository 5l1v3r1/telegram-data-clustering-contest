Krispy Kreme has worked out a deal with the donut reseller
06 Nov 2019, 19:27 by Mark Frauenfelder
On Monday I posted a story about how Krispy Kreme told a 21-year-old college student that he couldn't buy its donuts at full retail price from a store in Iowa and resell them 250 miles away in Minnesota, where there are no Krispy Kreme stores.
Well, it looks like the corporate bigwigs at Krispy Kreme have changed their mind. Not only are they giving Jayson Gonzalez the OK to resell its donuts at a handsome profit, they are going to help him with his business and college education.
From CNN:
The company tells CNN that it was concerned that the doughnuts were not meeting its quality standards due to the long drive from Iowa to Minnesota.However, after an outpouring of support, the company is now working on a deal with Gonzalez to allow him to become an independent operator.""Today, we reached out to Jayson to express our appreciation for his love of Krispy Kreme and admiration for his entrepreneurial spirit,"" a spokeswoman for Krispy Kreme tells CNN. ""We are going to help him achieve his goals, which include being debt-free when he graduates in 2021, in part by selling Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. ""We wish Jayson great success and we're thrilled to help him achieve it by donating 500 dozen doughnuts when he re-starts his business.""
