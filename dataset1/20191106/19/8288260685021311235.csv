The transfer window may have slammed shut a few months ago but that doesn’t mean that West Bromwich Albion cannot bolster their ranks with new additions.
A number of free agents remain on the hunt for a new club, some of whom have experience in helping to guide a club from the Championship to the riches of the Premier League.
Here, we have identified six players that clubs could consider to provide a boost to their ranks.
Mile Jedinak
The former Australia captain was promoted to the Premier League with Crystal Palace in 2013, spending four seasons in the top-flight before moving to Aston Villa.
Last season, Jedinak featured 17 times during Villa’s promotion-winning campaign and, despite being 35, his experience in earning promotion could be vital for a number of clubs.

Ben Marshall
At 28-years-old, Ben Marshall should be in the prime years of his career but is instead without a club following his exit from Norwich City in the summer, having spent last season on loan with Millwall.
Having started his career with Stoke City, Marshall floated around a number of EFL clubs and made four appearances for the Canaries in their promotion-winning campaign last season before moving to Millwall.
 
Jordon Mutch
The 27-year-old Jordon Mutch is certainly well travelled, with his last two places of employment being in South Korea and Canada. At his age though, he has a lot left to offer.
Mutch actually enjoyed promotion to the Premier League twice during his time in England, although he didn’t make an appearance for Birmingham City during the 2008-09 campaign, but he featured 22 times for Cardiff City during the 2012-13 season.
 
Ross Wallace
The one-cap Scotland international played 32 times for Sunderland during the 2006-07 season, when the Black Cats won promotion to the top-flight, and was also promoted with Burnley in 2014-15.
Now 34, the fact he appeared just once for Fleetwood Town in League One last season is a concern but he could still be a useful asset.
 
Jack Rodwell
The 28-year-old has been a free-agent since leaving Blackburn Rovers in the summer.
The former Everton and Man City midfielder's career has stalled in recent years, although he had been linked with a shock move to Roma.
That has now fallen through and he is still available to sign before the transfer window opens.
