      <p>Last month, Microsoft announced the new Surface Pro X, an ARM-powered device running full Windows 10. Instead of using a generic Snapdragon processor, Microsoft partnered with Qualcomm to create a custom SQ1 chipset to power this device. Despite being the thinnest Surface, the Surface Pro X offers decent performance and great visual experience through its virtually edge-to-edge 13” touchscreen. You can make Surface Pro X a full laptop with Surface Pro X Signature Keyboard and Slim Pen. The new <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-goes-on-sale-today/">Surface Pro X went on sale</a> early this week and it is available in following variants and you can order it from Amazon today.</p>
