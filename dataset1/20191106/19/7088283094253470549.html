        <b>Chinese experts will collaborate with France to restore Notre-Dame cathedral, state media announced Wednesday. It comes after a meeting between the two countries' heads of state in Beijing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"China and France will collaborate on the theme and model and select Chinese expert candidates for the <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/06/c_138533590.htm">cooperative restoration work</a> in 2020," Chai Xiaoming, director of the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage said in an interview with state-run China Daily on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Xiaoming was speaking on the third day of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Beijing, during which he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-france-macron/china-and-france-sign-deals-worth-15-billion-during-macrons-visit-chinese-official-idUSKBN1XG0NM">signed contracts totaling $15 billion</a> with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jingping.</p>
      <p>The two leaders also found common ground on Notre-Dame. </p>
      <p>Since the blaze, which took 400 firefighters to control, Chinese and French authorities have been in touch about cooperating on restoration efforts for the 850-year-old cathedral.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chinese experience</b>
      </p>
      <p>A document jointly signed by the two countries reported that selected experts will join the French team in on-site restoration.</p>
      <p>"China has a great deal of experience in renovating ancient buildings affected by fire, especially ones made of wood," Xiaoming said.</p>
      <p>"This means we could offer suggestions on how to approach the renovation of the oak-framed roof on Notre Dame Cathedral," he added.</p>
      <p>The cathedral, which was scarred in April after a fire tore through its roof and toppled its spire, was the most visited historic monument in Europe.</p>
