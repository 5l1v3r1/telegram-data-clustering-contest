        <b>Arsenal's 100% record in the Europa League this season ended as Bruno Duarte scored a 91st-minute equaliser for Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shkodran Mustafi had provided the Gunners with the breakthrough with an unmarked header from a Nicolas Pepe free-kick with 10 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>But Vitoria came to life in the closing stages and former Spurs man Marcus Edwards' cross from the right caused confusion in the Arsenal defence, allowing Duarte to equalise with a scissor-kick.</p>
      <p>The result was Arsenal's fourth consecutive draw in all competitions in a turbulent week that saw Granit Xhaka stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Group F leaders Arsenal will still qualify for the last 32 on Thursday if third-placed Standard Liege lose to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <h4>Arsenal fail to hold lead again</h4>
      <p>Arsenal manager Unai Emery made eight changes from the side that drew 1-1 with Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday, including handing the captain's armband to defender Rob Holding with former skipper Xhaka not part of the squad.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland captain was stripped of the captaincy following an angry confrontation with home fans during the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at Emirates Stadium on 27 October.</p>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who will take over as club captain from Xhaka, and German midfielder Mesut Özil also did not travel to Portugal.</p>
      <p>Emery opted for a change in formation with a defensive back three of Holding, Sokratis and goalscorer Mustafi, with youngsters Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Kieran Tierney adding an attacking threat as wing-backs.</p>
      <p>But for the second time in a week the Gunners were punished late on and failed to take all three points.</p>
      <p>In a match played in torrential rain, the first half was largely uneventful with Vitoria showing early warning signs when their midfielder Pepe hit the post with a long-range effort and Edwards forced a good save from Emiliano Martinez.</p>

        <figcaption>Mustafi broke the deadlock on 80 minutes with Arsenal's first effort on target</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Martinez was again called into action minutes later when a Vitoria free-kick found the unmarked Edmond Tapsoba but the centre-back's flicked header was palmed away.</p>
      <p>Vitoria keeper Douglas was not tested in the opening 45 minutes as the Gunners failed to register a shot on target despite dominating possession.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's best chance of the first half fell to Holding after clever play down the left-hand side by 18-year-old Bukayo Saka. The skipper for the match was unchallenged as he rose to meet the cross but his header went over the bar.</p>
      <p>In the second half the Gunners began to take control and were rewarded on 80 minutes thanks to Mustafi's header from a free-kick by Pepe, who scored twice from set-pieces against Vitoria in the final 10 minutes at Emirates Stadium two weeks ago to give his side a 3-2 win.</p>
      <p>Another victory looked to have been sealed here but Arsenal's defensive frailties were exposed in stoppage time as Vitoria found a late surge of tempo to put the Gunners under pressure and find an equaliser, earning them their first point in the Europa League this season.</p>
      <p>Spanish midfielder Dani Ceballos suffered a hamstring injury in the second half and has been ruled out of the trip to Leicester on Saturday by Emery.</p>
      <p>"He has a small injury but I don't think he is going to be available this week." he said.</p>
      <h4>Man of the match - Shkodran Mustafi (Arsenal)</h4>

      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>Arsenal travel to the King Power Stadium to face Brendan Rodgers' high-flying Leicester in the Premier League at 17:30 GMT on Saturday. The Gunners are back in Europa League action on Thursday, 28 November against Eintracht Frankfurt at Emirates Stadium.</p>
