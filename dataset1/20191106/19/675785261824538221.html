      <h1>Unai Emery's tactics questioned by Shkodran Mustafi after Arsenal draw with Vitoria</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal put in another below-par display as they drew 1-1 with Vitoria in the Europa League in Portugal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:05:24+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi appeared to question Unai Emery's decision to play with a back three for their latest below-par performance.</p>
      <p>The Gunners drew 1-1 against Vitoria in Guimaraes after conceding a late equaliser in their Europa League clash in Portugal.</p>
      <p>Mustafi had opened the scoring in the 80th minute only to see his side pegged back - and he felt they struggled to find "rhythm" as a result of the system deployed.</p>
      <p>Emery opted to tighten things up with Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Rob Holding alongside Mustafi in an unfamiliar system.</p>

      <p>Mustafi told BT Sport: "We played with a back three, a system for a long time we didn’t play. So we needed our time a little bit to get the rhythm in.</p>
      <p>"In the first half we didn’t do as we wanted. I think we came out better in the second half, had better rhythm, better passing.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm. Everyone wants to show and give everything, sometimes when you are over-motivated it’s difficult to deal with that.</p>

      <p>"But I think at the end of the day we need to stay calm, play our football, believe in ourselves and then in the final third try and do it a little bit more intelligently with more accuracy with our last pass."</p>
      <p>Mustafi also claimed the breakdown of the organised nature of the game as Vitoria pushed for a late equaliser was something they struggled to deal with.</p>
      <p>He said: "I would love to finish in the 90th minute but when you score a goal and you still have time left to play against a team like today they throw everything up front.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes it’s not organised any more, they throw a lot of bodies in the box, they keep crossing, I think we could have done better but in the end we have to accept and take the point with us.</p>
      <p>“We could have dealt with it [Vitoria’s goal] a little bit earlier, rather than letting them put the cross in. In the end you have to accept it and move forward, take the positive things from the game.</p>
      <p>"They are a good side. They are in the Europa League for a reason, they have quality and are quite compact."</p>
