      <h4>The big picture: Razer expanded its lineup of wireless gaming mice on Wednesday with the arrival of the Razer Basilisk Ultimate and the Razer Basilisk X HyperSpeed. Each mouse offers its own unique strengths at two vastly different price points, covering gamers across a range of budgets.</h4>
      <p>The higher-end of the two models, the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-basilisk-ultimate#_ga=2.84465119.775650975.1572901205-1731110852.1572371048">Razer Basilisk Ultimate</a> features the same <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-focus-plus-sensor#_ga=2.243728195.775650975.1572901205-1731110852.1572371048">Focus+ 20K DPI Optical Sensor</a> found in the Razer Viper Ultimate. It also utilizes Razer’s HyperSpeed wireless technology which the company claims is 25 faster than any other wireless gaming technology (based on click latency).</p>
      <p>Razer’s new pointer also comes equipped with its optical mouse switches. They’re rated for 70 million clicks and require no physical contact to send electrical signals to your PC. As a result, Razer says there is no need for debounce delay and no corrosive effects.</p>

      <p>Razer has additionally added the ability to adjust the scroll wheel resistance via a dial on the bottom of the mouse and as a gaming product, you know it has RGB lighting – 14 zones, to be specific, which can be customized using Razer Chroma Studio software. Other features include on-the-fly sensitivity adjustments, hybrid on-board and cloud storage for multiple profiles, wired and wireless usage modes and 11 programmable buttons. Battery life is rated at up to 100 hours (without lighting).</p>
