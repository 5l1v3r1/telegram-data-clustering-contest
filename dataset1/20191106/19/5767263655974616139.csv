Tom Cruise, Colonel Sanders, and Eeyore, who we have seen a thousand times, can still surprise us if we look at them closely. We bet that some specifics of their looks will be very difficult to unsee.
We at Bright Side dug through the internet to find the most intriguing photos, because we know that unexpected details in everyday things tend to raise one’s mood significantly.
1. There is a bear on the Toblerone logo. Have you noticed it before?

2. Colonel Sanders’ bowtie looks like a stick figure body.

4. Have you ever realized that Fred Jones from the Scooby-Doo series wears overalls under his sweater?



5. John Travolta ’s nose has a memory effect — it doesn’t bend back.

10. If you’ve ever looked at Australia for a long time, you might have also seen Scooby-Doo in it.



11. Have you ever noticed this feature of EXIT signs? Also, there is an arrow between E and X or perhaps that’s a house.
