美參院聽證會聚焦抖音海外版 數據風險已滲入軍方

06 Nov 2019, 19:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月07日訊】週二（11月5日），美國參議員在聽證會上重點討論了中國抖音平台海外版TikTok對美國國家安全和公民隱私的威脅。專家在聽證會上指出，中共可能利用TikTok獲取美國軍人的圖像，開發針對美軍的智能武器。
據《美國之音》報導，在這次聽證會上，共和党參議員霍利(Josh Hawley)將重點放在音樂短視頻分享平台TikTok。霍利身兼參議院司法委員會犯罪、恐怖主義與國土安全小組委員會主席。
他表示，美國家長們應該知道，TikTok在美國十幾歲的青少年非常受歡迎，連扎克伯格都擔心TikTok會搶走臉書的市場份額。而其他人則應該擔心TikTok的另一種威脅。
他接著說，一個被中國共產黨滲透的公司會知道你的孩子在哪裏，知道他們的長相和聲音，知道他們在看什麼，知道他們互相分享什麼。TikTok雖然聲稱他們沒有把美國用戶的數據存儲在中國，但是只要一名中共官員敲一下他們中國總部的門，TikTok就會隨時按照中共政府的需要交出那些數據。



霍利認為，使用TikTok的不僅有青少年，還有為美國政府和軍方工作的人，而美國年輕軍人用戶的數據有可能被中共用於訓練人工智能和自主武器開發。
與他一起作證的專家之一、傳統基金會的高級研究員科欽(Klon Kitchen)也肯定了霍利的判斷。科欽說，中共絕對可能將通過各種方式獲取美國男女軍人的圖像，用於軍事目的。比如，中共開發的圖像識別目前只能在中國使用，大量獲取西方人的圖像就可能彌補這一點。



霍利在聽證會後表示，他很可能建議美國政府和軍方人員停止使用TikTok，特別是處於敏感職位的人，必須明白其安全風險。
在這次聽證會之前，TikTok風靡美國就已引起美國政界的高度關注，美國外國投資委員會(CFIUS)已開始對Tiktok的中國母公司位字節跳動公司2017年的美國併購案進行審查。
Tiktok公司代表拒絕出席這次聽證會，只提交一封信否認自己接受中共政府審查。但聽證會上為其留了一張空椅子。
聽證會上還有一張空椅子，留給了美國蘋果公司。霍利在聽證會上批評蘋果公司迎合中共政府的要求，下架了一款幫助香港抗議者和市民在警察暴力鎮壓時確保安全的應用程序。
霍利當天還在推特上表示，蘋果在中國存儲大量數據和密鑰，是重大安全隱患，這給北京提供了後門，用來獲取美國人與其在中國的親人、朋友或商業夥伴交流信息。

US Senate hearing focused on vibrato overseas version data risk has penetrated the military

06 Nov 2019, 19:17

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 07, 2019] On Tuesday (November 5th), US Senators focused on the threat of US national security and citizen privacy on the overseas version of China's vibrating platform, TikTok. Experts pointed out at the hearing that the CCP may use TikTok to obtain images of US soldiers and develop smart weapons for the US military.
According to Voice of America, Republican Senator Josh Hawley focused on the music short video sharing platform TikTok at the hearing. Holly is chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He said that American parents should know that TikTok is very popular among teenagers in the United States, and even Zuckerberg is worried that TikTok will steal Facebook's market share. Others should be concerned about another threat from TikTok.
He went on to say that a company infiltrated by the Chinese Communist Party would know where your children are, know their looks and voices, know what they are looking at and know what they share with each other. Although TikTok claims that they did not store US user data in China, as long as a Chinese official knocks on the door of their Chinese headquarters, TikTok will hand over the data according to the needs of the Chinese government.



Holly believes that the use of TikTok is not only for adolescents, but also for the US government and the military, while the data of young American military users may be used by the CCP to train artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons development.
One of the experts who testified with him, Klon Kitchen, a senior researcher at the Heritage Foundation, also confirmed Holly's judgment. Cochin said that the CCP is absolutely likely to obtain images of American men and women soldiers for military purposes through various means. For example, the image recognition developed by the Chinese Communist Party can only be used in China at present, and it is possible to make up for this by obtaining a large number of images of Westerners.



After the hearing, Holly said that he is likely to suggest that the US government and military personnel stop using TikTok, especially those in sensitive positions, must understand its security risks.
Prior to this hearing, TikTok's popularity in the United States has caused great concern in the US political circles. The US Foreign Investment Committee (CFIUS) has begun to review the 2017 US M&A case of Tiktok's Chinese parent company.
The Tiktok company representative refused to attend the hearing and only submitted a letter denying that he accepted the Chinese government's review. But at the hearing, an empty chair was left for it.
There was an empty chair at the hearing, which was reserved for the American Apple Company. At the hearing, Holly criticized Apple for catering to the requirements of the Chinese government and removed an application that would help Hong Kong protesters and citizens ensure security when the police violently suppress.
Holly also said on Twitter that Apple's storage of large amounts of data and keys in China is a major security risk, which provides Beijing with a back door for Americans to exchange information with their relatives, friends or business partners in China.
