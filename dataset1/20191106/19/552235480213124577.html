      <p>A twisted thug who tried to blame his puppy for a horror murder bid on a baby has been jailed for 12 years.</p>
      <p>Paul Carlton violently shook the eight-week old boy leaving him with life changing brain injuries in August 2017.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was supposedly looking after the child at Carlton's home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sickening-firework-attack-disrupts-church-13912071">Nitshill,</a> Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Carlton claimed he had been briefly tidying his garden when he heard a cry from inside.</p>
      <p>He told how he had left the boy in the flat in his baby swing alone with his two dogs.</p>
      <p>Carlton described one of the pets – a cross American Bulldog-Staffordshire terrier puppy called Sapphire – as “boisterous”.</p>
      <p>He said he could only “speculate” Sapphire seriously injured the baby as he did not do it.</p>
      <p>But jurors found Carlton guilty of attempted murder and he was today sentenced at the High <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> in Glasgow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lord Burns told him: “These cases are always tragic. The boy has been rendered helpless by your actions.</p>
      <p>“He was as vulnerable a child as could possibly be imagined.</p>
      <p>“You have tried to deflect responsibility by various means but the jury found you guilty.</p>
      <p>“He is now wholly dependent on his mother and others.”</p>
      <p>The boy had been in and out of hospital since he was 10 days old.</p>
      <p>Carlton was looking after the boy on August 9, 2017, while the child's mum went for a beauty appointment and lunch with her sister.</p>
      <p>The baby had been checked by a health visitor that morning and found to be fine.</p>
      <p>Carlton had actually sent the woman a video of her son while she was out. He was waving and kicking his legs.</p>
      <p>The mum left her son that day at 12.58pm – by 2.29pm Carlton was dialling 999.</p>
      <p>Carlton told jurors he had been out in the garden when he heard a “loud cry”.</p>
      <p>He claimed he went back indoors and realised something was wrong.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Carlton: “He was not opening his eyes properly.” Carlton's grandparents visited and agreed the child needed medical help.</p>
      <p>The baby was found to have suffered massive brain damage.</p>
      <p>Professor Robin Sellar – a neuro-radiologist – was asked in court how the injuries could have occurred.</p>
      <p>He told jurors: “In that time frame, something very dramatic has happened. The injuries are consistent with a shaking injury.”</p>
      <p>Carlton denied being responsible for what happened.</p>
      <p>He said: “I would never hurt any child.”</p>
      <p>Carlton claimed he was not “covering up” the attack and had not wanted to “end the life” of the baby.</p>
      <p>Asked about his dog Sapphire, he then claimed she was a “very hyper puppy” at the time who “did not know her own strength”.</p>
      <p>He said the pet had previously “cut and bruised” a little girl.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Dale Hughes asked him: “If there was an example of this dog being potentially harmful, why let it near the boy?”</p>
      <p>Carlton: “I thought because I had another dog she would learn from him and calm down possibly.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Prosecutor Alan Cameron went on to point out the boy had no bite marks or cuts associated with a possible dog attack.</p>
      <p>He put to Carlton: “The dog would have to have picked the boy up, shaken him with such vigour and put him back where he was or collide with him with such force.”</p>
      <p>Carlton: “I understand where the hospital is coming from, but the only explanation I have is the dog as I know I did not harm the child.”</p>
      <p>Mr Cameron: “The dog is just speculation?” He replied: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Jurors were told the child – now aged two – can not crawl, walk or talk.</p>
      <p>It emerged during the trial Carlton had previously been violent to the boy's mum.</p>
      <p>This included headbutting her causing her nose to bleed.</p>
