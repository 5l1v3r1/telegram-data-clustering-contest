      <p>Drinking! It’s something a lot of people do, and it’s also something a lot of people don’t do. If you like to enjoy a drink now and again, chances are you’ve been living through what’s probably best known as the “<a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/cocktails-spirits/cocktail-revival-history">Cocktail Revival</a>”: the global movement that’s put mixed drinks of various provenance into the hands of imbibers across the globe. (I’d locate its beginning around 2010, because, according to <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/cocktails-spirits/cocktail-revival-history"><i>Food &amp; Wine</i></a>, that’s when the casual cocktail bar got its start.)</p>
      <p>The next wave, naturally, is making those sometimes-complicated drinks yourself, at home. Because even if cocktails are readily accessible, the price of admission — read: ingredients and what good service costs — can sometimes feel a little high. That’s where the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fthebarsys.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-barsys-coaster&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Barsys Coaster</a> comes in.</p>
      <aside>Place your glass on the coaster, pair it to the app, and start pouring</aside>
      <p>Barsys, the inventors of the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/barsys-automated-cocktail-maker-review/">$1,000 robot bartender</a>, have created a sleek, elegant $149 saucer that purports to help you make perfect cocktails at home. (If you preorder the coaster, you can get it for a sweet $95; they start shipping in December.) The Barsys Coaster is a smart device that’s supposed to take the guesswork out of how much to pour: all you have to do is place your glass on the coaster, pair it to the app, and start pouring.</p>
      <p>Their app will explain what you need, and the coaster will light up when you should finish pouring. “With the Coaster, we set out to make serving a cocktail as easy as grabbing a beer or pouring a glass of wine,” wrote Barsys founder and CEO Akshet Tewari in a press release. “Cocktail-making requires a level of skill and precision that anyone can now obtain.”</p>
      <p>The holidays are coming up soon, which means you’ll need to start finding gifts for relatives that you <i>may</i> not know super well. And honestly, for those people, what’s better than giving the gift of perfect cocktails at home? If they drink, that is. If they don’t, try Wish.com.</p>
