      <h1>Jemima hilariously hits back at JUI-F cleric over WikiLeaks claim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:50:23+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Jemima Goldsmith, former wife of Prime Minister Imran Khan and British documentary producer, hilariously responded to Mufti Kifayatullah, firebrand cleric of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), who has claimed that her cousin ‘Wiki’ founded WikiLeaks — a non-profit organisation that publishes news leaks by anonymous  sources.</p>
      <p>During an interview with a private TV channel, Kifayatullah had claimed that Jemima’s first cousin named ‘Wiki’ is the actual mastermind behind WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>“Imran Khan, Jemima, the Goldsmith family, Henry Kissinger and WikiLeaks are pieces of the same agenda,” he alleged.</p>

      <p>While taking a jibe at the JUI-F leader, Jemima posted a series of tweets on the micro-blogging site on Wednesday and tackled the situation on a lighter note.</p>
      <p>“For those who don’t speak Urdu – apparently I have a first cousin called “Wiki” – who set up Wikileaks- which is a Zionist tool, supporting Imran Khan’s Zionist agenda. This from a so called Islamic scholar/ cleric…. “Wiki’ cousin hai Jemima ka”.</p>

      <p>Mufti Kifayatullah is a prominent JUI-F leader who was arrested on October 27 for his provocative statements about state institutions.</p>
      <p>However, he was released on bail granted by the Peshawar High Court a few days.</p>
      <p>WikkiLeaks was founded by its publisher Julian Assange in 2006 and has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.</p>
