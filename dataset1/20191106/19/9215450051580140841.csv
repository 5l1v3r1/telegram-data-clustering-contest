【放寬按揭】新房策掀上車客換樓潮 納米樓由誰接貨｜布少明

新一份《施政報告》放寬按揭保險成數，對二手交投帶來刺激作用；加上中美貿易戰的談判進程亦有突破性的進展，令近期新盤繼續旺場。剛推出兩個主打細單位的新盤，入票反應和銷情均相當不俗，整體樓市似已擺脫早前弱勢，漸入佳境。

綜合美聯分行資料，統計10月21日至10月27日的一週，全港35個大型屋苑共錄103宗買賣，已是連續兩週企穩100宗以上水平，是自為3月中以來首見（見下圖）。
放寬按揭帶動成交升182%
若以《施政報告》公布後的12日（10月16日至27日）計算，35大屋苑共錄得200宗成交，較10月首15日合共71宗大幅高出近182%，近期樓市之交投熱度可見一斑。
近期坊間有意見指出，近年「納米樓」之所以成為市場大熱，主要源於當局實施的按揭成數限制，令首期不足的買家，逼不得已將購買力集中在600萬元以下、有機會做到八成甚至是九成按揭的物業；但隨著首置按保的放寬，「納米樓」熱潮相信難免逐漸消退。



《施政報告》放寬按保措施雖有助「納米樓」「散熱」，但相信市場對「納米樓」仍有需求。「納米樓」擁有「Lump Sum」細的優勢，其總價始終對實力相對不足的年輕首置客有吸引力。 只要「納米樓」的叫價相對其他中小型單位而言並無太大溢價，相信這板塊仍有不少捧場客，不少年輕的上車客仍會視「納米樓」為首選，又或是未來「換樓」的踏腳石。
與此同時，放寬按保亦有望引發近年買入「納米樓」的買家換樓，因近年買入物業者十居其九均有獲利，足以當換樓的首期。 而「納米樓」業主換樓後，原有單位由於「Lump Sum」細，只要叫價合理，不難獲另一批年輕買家購入物業，激發換樓鏈。 物業市場是「百貨應百客」，因此「納米樓」熱潮有可能略為減退，但不太可能完全沒有市場。

[Let's relax the mortgage] New house policy, change the tide on the passengers, who will receive the goods in the nano building | Bu Shaoming
06 Nov 2019, 19:30 by the property market
The new ""Policy Report"" relaxed the number of mortgage insurance, which stimulated second-hand trading; and the negotiation process of the Sino-US trade war also made breakthrough progress, which made the new market continue to prosper. Just launched two new units of the main unit, the ticket response and sales are quite good, the overall property market seems to have got rid of the previous weakness, and gradually enter the good situation.

According to the information of the Mid-Affair Branch, from the period of October 21 to October 27, a total of 103 transactions were recorded in 35 large housing estates in Hong Kong. It has been stable for more than 100 consecutive weeks for two consecutive weeks. First sight (see picture below).
Relaxation of mortgages led to a 182% increase in turnover
In the 12th day after the announcement of the Policy Address (October 16 to 27), a total of 200 transactions were recorded in the 35 estates, which was nearly 182% higher than the 71 in the first 15 days of October. The heat of trading can be seen.
Some people have pointed out in recent weeks that the reason why the ""nano-rises"" have become a hot market in recent years is mainly due to the restrictions on the number of mortgages implemented by the authorities. The first-phase buyers are forced to concentrate their purchasing power below 6 million yuan and have the opportunity to do so. To 80% or even 90% of the mortgaged property; but with the relaxation of the first home insurance, the ""Nano Building"" boom is inevitably fading.



The ""Policy Report"" has relaxed the scope of the ""Nano Building"". However, it is believed that there is still demand for the ""Nano Building"". ""Nano Building"" has the advantage of ""Lump Sum"", and its total price is always attractive to young first-time customers with relatively insufficient strength. As long as the asking price of the ""Nano Building"" is not much higher than that of other small and medium-sized flats, I believe that there are still many visitors in this sector. Many young passengers will still regard the ""Nano Building"" as the first choice, or A stepping stone for ""changing the building"" in the future.
At the same time, the relaxation of the insurance policy is also expected to trigger the purchase of ""nanometer building"" buyers in recent years, because the purchase of property in recent years, ten of them are profitable, enough to be the first phase of the change. After the owners of the ""Nano Building"" changed their flats, the original units were fined by the ""Lump Sum"". As long as the asking price is reasonable, it is not difficult for another group of young buyers to purchase the property and stimulate the change of the building chain. The property market is ""a department store should be a hundred passengers"", so the ""nano-rise"" boom may be slightly reduced, but it is unlikely that there will be no market at all.
