      <h1>Get a new 64GB Pixel 3 for just $440</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:00:17+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Pixel 4 <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/23/pixel-4-xl-review/">isn't quite a runaway success</a>, especially the smaller version with its limited battery capacity. If you were holding out for an upgrade, last year's Pixel 3 is still a solid choice, especially now that it's on sale for one of the lowest prices we've seen yet.</p>
      <p>Woot (a store owned by Amazon) is currently selling new 64GB Pixel 3 phones for $439.99. Prices for the year-old flagship have been slightly lower a few times in recent history, like <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/07/the-pixel-3-is-at-its-lowest-price-ever-391-on-rakuten-right-now/">$391 from Rakuten last month</a>, but Woot is selling the device new in-box, and shipping is free for Amazon Prime members.</p>

      <p>If you're not familiar with the small Pixel 3, it comes equipped with a Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (in the version on sale, anyway), a 5.5-inch 1080x2160 AMOLED screen, and IP68 water resistance. The 12.2MP rear camera is the main selling point, but it's also one of the few phones right now with Android 10.</p>
      <p>The Woot product description says the Pixel 3 has been carrier-unlocked, but it's not clear if this is the Verizon model with the unlockable bootloader. If flashing ROMs is important to you, keep that in mind. Alternatively, you can get <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/google-pixel-3-xl-gsm-onlynew?ref=w_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_6">a Pixel 3 XL for the same price</a>, but that model is restricted to GSM networks and only has international carrier bands.</p>
