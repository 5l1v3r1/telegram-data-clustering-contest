（中央社記者余曉涵台北6日電）交通部次長黃玉霖表示，交通部今天有條件通過宜蘭縣鐵路高架可行性研究，路段為宜蘭到羅東，全長約16.1公里，總經費約新台幣252.09億元、自償率約3.86%。
為促進蘭陽平原東西部交通運輸順暢，宜蘭縣政府從民國97年起，開始向中央爭取鐵路高架化建設經費，但提送中央的可行性評估與提報計畫數度被退回，直到今天終於露出曙光。
交通部今天召開宜蘭縣鐵路高架可行性研究審查會，會中審查宜蘭縣鐵路高架化的可行性。黃玉霖受訪說，此案原則可行，有條件通過。
黃玉霖表示，這次是宜蘭縣政府自行提出調整計畫內容，路段為宜蘭到羅東段，審查會後拍板認定原則可行，但因為宜蘭縣政府還沒跟台鐵局等達成共識，所以必須修訂相關計畫內容後，由鐵道局跟台鐵局確認計畫內容，再報行政院。
黃玉霖呼籲，宜蘭縣政府的態度應該要更積極跟台鐵局研商都市發展與場站開發，才能讓計畫順利進行。
他也說，自償率部分，是按照原有的規範進行審查，據了解宜蘭縣政府已經得到議會同意。
