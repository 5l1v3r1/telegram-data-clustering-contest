      <h1>Krispy Kreme has worked out a deal with the donut reseller</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:27:29+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>On Monday I posted <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/04/krispy-kreme-forbids-student-f.html">a story</a> about how Krispy Kreme told a 21-year-old college student that he couldn't buy its donuts at full retail price from a store in Iowa and resell them 250 miles away in Minnesota, where there are no Krispy Kreme stores.</p>
      <p>Well, it looks like the corporate bigwigs at Krispy Kreme have changed their mind. Not only are they giving Jayson Gonzalez the OK to resell its donuts at a handsome profit, they are going to help him with his business and college education.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/05/us/krispy-kreme-minnesota-trnd/index.html?ref=hvper.com&amp;utm_source=hvper.com&amp;utm_medium=website">CNN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The company tells CNN that it was concerned that the doughnuts were not meeting its quality standards due to the long drive from Iowa to Minnesota.<br/><br/>However, after an outpouring of support, the company is now working on a deal with Gonzalez to allow him to become an independent operator.<br/><br/>"Today, we reached out to Jayson to express our appreciation for his love of Krispy Kreme and admiration for his entrepreneurial spirit," a spokeswoman for Krispy Kreme tells CNN. "We are going to help him achieve his goals, which include being debt-free when he graduates in 2021, in part by selling Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. <br/><br/>"We wish Jayson great success and we're thrilled to help him achieve it by donating 500 dozen doughnuts when he re-starts his business."</blockquote>
