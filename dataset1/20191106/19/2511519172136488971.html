      <p>A security alert at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport that prompted an investigation by the Dutch military police was a false alarm, according to the airline involved.</p>
      <p>Police said on Wednesday night that they were investigating a suspicious situation aboard an aircraft, with emergency workers flooding the travel hub, according to Dutch media.</p>
      <p>SkyTeam, a consortium of airlines, confirmed in a statement to <i>The Independent </i>that the aircraft belonged to Air Europa but was painted in SkyTeam livery.</p>
      <p>Air Europa, a Spanish company, tweeted a little more than an hour after the alert, that it had been a false alarm.</p>
      <p>It said: “False alarm. This afternoon on the Amsterdam-to-Madrid flight an alert setting hijacking protocols in motion was mistakenly activated. Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and hoping to take off soon. We apologise.”</p>
      <p>The police – known as the Marechaussee – said on Twitter that passengers and crew the aircraft had been safely taken off, about an hour after it first said it had responded to the security alert.</p>
      <p>“Investigation on site continues,” the force added.</p>
      <p>Last year, more than 100 airlines flew from Schiphol to some 327 countries, and carried 71.1 million passengers, the airport’s website said.</p>
