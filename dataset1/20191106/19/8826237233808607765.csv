(ALAMO, N.M.) — Navajo authorities have confirmed two people died and 14 others were injured during a traditional religious ceremony.
KOAT-TV reports Christina Tsosie with the Navajo Police Department says the 14 injured people were treated for smoke inhalation. Tsosie says the ceremony lasts throughout the night and involves an open fire pit burning inside a hogan, a traditional Navajo structure typically built out of logs and earth.

Police say a woman reported finding an unresponsive man and woman Sunday on the floor inside the hogan.
