In front of a packed room, Regina Public Schools’ board chair Katherine Gagne opened Tuesday’s board meeting with an apology, before being presented with a petition calling for her removal as board chair.
During a previous board meeting three weeks ago, a motion brought forward by trustee Aleana Young was voted down 4-3 by the board.The motion called for the school division to “recognize and support” Pride week and to fly the Pride flag for a week every June.
An outcry from the community followed, along with confusion over what the vote meant for LGBT staff and students in the division.

“We did not handle the situation the way we should have … I apologize personally for how this motion was handled, and I am sorry,” Gagne told the room, adding that the board should not have put the motion on the agenda until trustees had had more time to discuss it.
Gagne said she recognizes that circulating “misinformation” following the vote caused “pain and anxiety” in the community. She also sought to clear her name amid swirling allegations online that she was involved in an email campaign putting pressure on trustees to vote against the motion.
“The information circulating about me personally giving direction and/or instructing a letter-writing campaign is not true,” she said.
Just a few minutes later Eric Bell, spokesperson for Queen City for All,  presented his petition calling for Gagne’s removal as board chair, which has received more than 5,000 signatures. Bell called on Gagne and the rest of the board to “reflect” on what the widespread support for the petition meant, and also asked that the board bring back the motion and pass it.
He handed the thick stack of papers to Gagne directly, who accepted the petition with a “thank you” and set it to the side. Gagne said the board would comment on the petition at a later date.

According to The School Division Administration Regulations, a board member can only be removed if a minimum of five electors apply for an order to a judge at Court of Queen’s Bench. The judge then decides if someone is “unfit to act as a member of the board of education.” There is no mention of a petition being able to remove a board member.
While Bell recognized that the petition has no legal bearing on the removal of a board member, he said he is hoping it will still bring about change.
“(Gagne is) responsible for the defeat of this motion and she should be held responsible for it,” Bell told reporters before the meeting began.
“I believe that she should apologize to everyone who’s been affected by this. She should resign from her position as board chair and I think most importantly, the board needs to bring back the motion and pass it.”
Bell said he has heard from staff, students and parents who are “embarrassed” at the outcome of the board’s vote.
“Teachers and students know that our schools are safe and welcoming and diverse places, and it’s really disappointing that the school board would sort of defeat a motion that would suggest … the opposite,” he said.
