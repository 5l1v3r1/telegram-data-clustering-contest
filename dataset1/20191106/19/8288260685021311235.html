      <h1>Five free agents West Brom could sign ahead of the January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion transfer news | A number of vastly-experienced players remain available on a free transfer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-06T19:00:00+00:00">06 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>The transfer window may have slammed shut a few months ago but that doesn’t mean that <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> cannot bolster their ranks with new additions.</p>
      <p>A number of free agents remain on the hunt for a new club, some of whom have experience in helping to guide a club from the Championship to the riches of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Here, we have identified six players that clubs could consider to provide a boost to their ranks.</p>
      <h3>Mile Jedinak</h3>
      <p>The former Australia captain was promoted to the Premier League with Crystal Palace in 2013, spending four seasons in the top-flight before moving to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Last season, Jedinak featured 17 times during Villa’s promotion-winning campaign and, despite being 35, his experience in earning promotion could be vital for a number of clubs.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Ben Marshall</h3>
      <p>At 28-years-old, Ben Marshall should be in the prime years of his career but is instead without a club following his exit from Norwich City in the summer, having spent last season on loan with Millwall.</p>
      <p>Having started his career with Stoke City, Marshall floated around a number of EFL clubs and made four appearances for the Canaries in their promotion-winning campaign last season before moving to Millwall.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Jordon Mutch</h3>
      <p>The 27-year-old Jordon Mutch is certainly well travelled, with his last two places of employment being in South Korea and Canada. At his age though, he has a lot left to offer.</p>
      <p>Mutch actually enjoyed promotion to the Premier League twice during his time in England, although he didn’t make an appearance for Birmingham City during the 2008-09 campaign, but he featured 22 times for Cardiff City during the 2012-13 season.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Ross Wallace</h3>
      <p>The one-cap Scotland international played 32 times for Sunderland during the 2006-07 season, when the Black Cats won promotion to the top-flight, and was also promoted with Burnley in 2014-15.</p>
      <p>Now 34, the fact he appeared just once for Fleetwood Town in League One last season is a concern but he could still be a useful asset.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Jack Rodwell</h3>
      <p>The 28-year-old has been a free-agent since leaving Blackburn Rovers in the summer.</p>
      <p>The former Everton and Man City midfielder's career has stalled in recent years, although he had been linked with a shock move to Roma.</p>
      <p>That has now fallen through and he is still available to sign before the transfer window opens.</p>
