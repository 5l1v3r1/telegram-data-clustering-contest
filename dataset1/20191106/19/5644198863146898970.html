      <p>SINGAPORE: Regional carrier SilkAir had a turbulent showing in the first half of the year because of the grounding of its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, even as parent company Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group turned in a higher profit.</p>
      <p>SilkAir - which will be merged with SIA following a cabin revamp expected to begin next year - reported operating losses of S$19 million for the six months ended September, deepening from a loss of S$3 million in the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-airlines-profit-sinks-on-fuel-costs-virgin-australia-10926492">same period a year earlier</a>.</p>

      <p>It also saw a reduction in capacity from route transfers to SIA’s budget airline Scoot.  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>SilkAir had operated six 737 Max aircraft before they were grounded in March following the two crashes; they are now at a storage facility in Alice Springs in Australia.</p>
      <p>Its <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/silkair-boeing-737-max-planes-order-intact-singapore-airlines-11542090">outstanding order for another 31 planes</a> - meant to replace its ageing Airbus 320s and 319 - are on hold until further notice. </p>
      <p>SilkAir has had to carry the depreciation costs of the six grounded planes, as well as the costs of keeping those aircraft in a “close-to-ready” state, Mr Stephen Barnes, senior vice president for finance at SIA, told reporters and industry analysts in a briefing on Wednesday (Nov 6).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The regional carrier also saw its expenditure go up by S$10 million, due in part to expenses related to the 737 Max as well as higher fuel costs. </p>
      <p>Despite an increase in traffic, SilkAir saw a S$6 million decline in operating revenue. </p>
      <p>
        <b>SIA POSTS HIGHER PROFIT</b>
      </p>
      <p>SilkAir's troubles did not drag parent company SIA Group down. The group reported a net profit of S$206 million for the first half this year, up from S$196 million in the year-ago period.</p>
      <p>Operating profit for the parent airline came in at S$465 million, an increase of 11 per cent from S$418 million.</p>
      <p>Its budget arm <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/scoot-singapore-airlines-silkair-growth-ceo-lee-lik-hsin-11637416">Scoot</a>, however, posted a S$77 million operating loss in the first half, up from a loss of S$10 million previously, as a decline in cargo revenue and higher expenditure offset results from an increase in passenger traffic.</p>
      <p>SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said that the group is banking on new revenue streams beyond its core aviation business as part of its digital transformation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>KrisShop, the airline’s travel retailer, has been revamped into an e-commerce player. </p>
      <p>The business - which had previously been outsourced - is now incorporated as its own company, 70 per cent of which is owned by SIA, said Mr Goh, adding that KrisShop has “made very good progress” in its new incarnation.  </p>
      <p>“In fact we expect by the end of this financial year, KrisShop will be able to yield a revenue in excess of S$60 million for the group,” he said. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the previously announced <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/sia-mas-singapore-malaysia-airlines-share-revenue-codeshare-12047542">partnership with Malaysia Airlines </a>could take shape within “nine months to a year”, said Mr Goh, noting this is dependent on regulatory approval. </p>
      <p>The two airlines announced last month that they had finalised an agreement, which is expected to see more code-sharing routes between the two, as well as revenue-sharing on flights between Singapore and Malaysia. </p>
