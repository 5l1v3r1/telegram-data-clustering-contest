BRYAN, Ohio (AP) - A county sheriff in Ohio has been convicted of posting confidential child abuse reports to the department's website and Facebook page.
The Bryan Times reports that a jury found Williams County Sheriff Steve Towns guilty on a misdemeanor charge of public dissemination of confidential information.
Special prosecutor Mark Weaver said Towns recklessly posted confidential reports about suspected child abuse and that at least one child victim was identified.
Towns said earlier this year that he had been frustrated with the handling of child abuse investigations in the county, so he posted the documents to let the public know what was happening.
A judge sentenced Towns to probation following the jury's verdict Tuesday.
The sheriff's attorney said he has served the public well and that they're considering an appeal.
