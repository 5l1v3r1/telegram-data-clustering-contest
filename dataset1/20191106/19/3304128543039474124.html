      <h1>IEBC Approves Petition Seeking Dissolution of Taita Taveta County</h1>

      <p>Taita Taveta County now stares at dissolution after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on Wednesday approved a petition seeking its suspension.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Wafula Chebukati, the commission chairman stated that the petition met the required threshold of support from at least  10 per cent of the registered voters in the county.</p>
      <p>According to Chebukati, the petition was supported by 21,861 registered voters.</p>
      <p>There are 155,000 voters in Taita Taveta with the law requiring signatures from at least 10 per cent of the total voters translating to 15,500 signatures.</p>
      <p>The petition will now be forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta who will submit a report on grounds to suspend the county to the apex intergovernmental body, which comprises of the President and all governors, within 14 days.</p>

      <p>Upon approval from the apex body, the President shall appoint a commission to inquire into the matter.</p>
      <p>Then the findings will be tabled at the Senate which will vote on the fate of the County.</p>
      <p>In July, Governor Granton Samboja signed a memorandum to initiate the petition to dissolve the county over the 2019-2020 budget stalemate with Members of County Assembly (MCAs).</p>
      <p>Chebukati’s statement, however, comes at a time the Taita Taveta ward representatives have buried the hatchet and agreed to work together with Samboja.</p>
      <p>The governor assented to the supplementary budget estimates forwarded to him by the county assembly on Wednesday. This brings to an end a four-month-long standoff.</p>
      <p>The governor had declined to approve the budget after the MCAs slashed the executive’s allocations and instead directed the money – Ksh833 million – to the ward development fund.</p>

      <p>He said the MCAs slashed the county budget estimates, hence denying county government development.</p>
      <p>This led to his impeachment which was recently overturned by the senate.</p>
      <p>30 MCAs on October 9 unanimously voted in favour of a special motion moved by Rong’e MCA Harris Keke after a four-hour debate over alleged gross misconduct.</p>
      <p>The Senate committee that was formulated to probe the decision by the Members of County Assembly (MCAs) dismissed the impeachment saying allegations raised against the governor were not substantiated.</p>
      <p>With the new developments, the petition might be suspended.</p>
