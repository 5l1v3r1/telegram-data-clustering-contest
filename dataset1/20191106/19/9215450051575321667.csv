美國聯邦儲備局議息會後一如預期，減息0.25厘。聯儲局主席鮑威爾於記者會上表示，目前的貨幣政策合適，似向巿場暗示今年內不會進一步減息，美股反覆靠穩。港股個別重磅股如滙豐控股（00005）季績遜預期，恒生指數指上升動力不足，短期仍維持炒股不炒市格局。

歐洲理事會主席圖斯克週一（10月28日）在Twitter宣布，歐盟27國成員同意將原定於週四（31日）屆滿的英國「脫歐」限期推遲三個月，至2020年1月31日。另一方面，英國國會下議院週三（30日）以口頭方式二讀通過首相約翰遜提出提前在12月12日舉行大選的動議，英國「脫歐」不明朗消息暫時消除，英鎊兌美元匯價走勢靠穩。
中美貿談變數仍多
巿場另一個焦點是中、美何時能簽署首階段協議。美國總統特朗普（Donald Trump）於週一表示，因智利近期政治不穩，美國或會在智利舉行亞太經合組織（APEC）會議前與中國簽署首階段協議。
同時，美國貿易代表辦公室（USTR）亦傳出，有意把價值340億美元中國商品原定於12月28日屆滿的25%關稅豁免期延長。正當各方面消息均對中、美兩國落實簽署首階段協議朝向正面之際，智利總統皮涅拉（Sebastián Piñera）週三突然宣布，因應智利連續多週有大型示威活動，原訂於11月16至17日舉行的APEC峰會或有機會取消。
更有消息指，內地方面已提出，以澳門代替智利作為中美貿易戰首階段協議的簽署地點。過往多次傳出中、美能快將達成協議，但在正式簽署前夕，卻意外地出現分岐，最終未能成事，更令雙方關係變得更緊張；因此，雙方一日未落實簽訂首階段協議，仍具有頗大變數。
中國第三季經濟（GDP）增長幅度已放緩至6%，創27年以來最低水平；內地10月份官方製造業採購經理指數（PMI）為49.3，低於市場預期的49.8，亦較9月份49.8為低，處於榮枯線之下，顯示內地經濟未來仍有下行風險。
國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）早前調低中國明年經濟增長預測至5.8%，正式失守「6」關口；若中、美最終未能簽署首階段協議，筆者恐怕在出口訂單進一步減少所影響下，內地明年及2021年經濟增長將分別降至5.7%及5.5%。
港股方面，滙控季績遜預期，市場對其他本地銀行如恒生銀行（00011）及東亞銀行（00023）亦有戒心，短期股價有壓力。內銀及內險股季度業績普遍勝預期，為大巿帶來支持。港股業績好淡參半，恒指在9月高位約27,366點附近阻力不輕，港股似在高位整固，出現炒股不炒巿格局。新經濟、內需消費、物業管理、公路及燃氣股仍可看高一線。
世茂房地產（00813）股價升至52週高位，跑贏其他同類股份。集團土地儲備偏布101個城市，涉及301個項目，約6,407萬平方米。截至年6月30日止集團半年營業額565.6億元人民幣，較2018年同期增長32.9%；期內股東應佔利潤為51.05億元人民幣，較上一年度增加19.5%。集團於今年9月的合約銷售額約為320.9億元人民幣，較去年同期上升57%，首九個月的累計合約銷售總額約為1,739.9億元人民幣，較去年同期上升44%。



現價較資產值折讓四成
集團今年訂下的銷售目標2,100億元人民幣，首九個月銷售總額已達全年目標的82.85%，筆者預期全年能超出目標的機會相當高。以現價計算，2019年度市盈率約7倍，股息率約5厘，現價較其每股資產折讓逾四成，估值吸引。
此外，集團亦具分拆酒店及物業管理業務條件，隨時可為投資者帶來額外回報。倉位方面，本倉於週一成功以開巿價9.39元吸納3,000股滔搏（06110）；而中升控股（00881）於週二（29日）升抵26.5元目標，順利沽出1,000股止賺。
另一方面，本倉上調至31元或以下吸納1,000股中國燃氣（00384）、4.6元或以下再補回15,000股中海物業（02669）、以及於25元或以下吸納1,000股世茂房地產。

Shimao Real Estate has a spin-off concept

After the US Federal Reserve's interest rate meeting, as expected, the interest rate cut was 0.25%. Fed Chairman Powell said at the press conference that the current monetary policy is appropriate, and it seems that the market will not further cut interest rates this year, and the US stocks will stabilize. Hundreds of heavyweights in Hong Kong stocks such as HSBC Holdings (00005) were inferior in expectations. The Hang Seng Index said that the upside momentum was insufficient, and the stock market was still not speculative in the short term.

European Council President Tusk announced on Twitter on Monday (October 28) that members of the EU-27 agreed to postpone the deadline for the Brexit, which was scheduled to expire on Thursday (31st), to three months, to 2020. March 31st. On the other hand, the House of Commons of the British Parliament on Wednesday (30th) read the second oral form through Prime Minister Johnson's motion to hold a general election on December 12th. The UK's ""Brexit"" unclear news was temporarily eliminated, and the British pound against the US dollar exchange rate trend Keep steady.
China-US trade talks are still more variable
Another focus of the market is when China and the United States can sign the first phase agreement. US President Donald Trump said on Monday that due to recent political instability in Chile, the United States may sign a first-phase agreement with China before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Chile.
At the same time, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) also announced that it intends to extend the 25% tariff exemption period for the $34 billion worth of Chinese goods originally scheduled to expire on December 28. Just as all sides of the news were positive about the implementation of the first phase of the agreement between China and the United States, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera suddenly announced on Wednesday that in response to Chile’s large-scale demonstrations for several weeks, it was originally scheduled for November. The APEC summit held from 16 to 17 may have a chance to cancel.
More news means that the mainland has proposed to replace Chile with Chile as the signing point for the first phase of the Sino-US trade war. In the past, China and the United States will soon reach an agreement. However, on the eve of the official signing, there was an unexpected disappointment. Eventually, the relationship between the two parties became even more tense. Therefore, the two parties failed to implement the first phase agreement. , still has quite a lot of variables.
China's third-quarter economic (GDP) growth rate has slowed to 6%, the lowest level in 27 years; the mainland's official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) in October was 49.3, lower than market expectations of 49.8, also compared with September. 49.8 is low, under the glory line, showing that the mainland economy still has downside risks in the future.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) earlier lowered China’s economic growth forecast to 5.8% next year and officially fell below the “6” mark. If China and the United States fail to sign the first phase agreement, I am afraid that under the influence of further reduction in export orders, The economic growth of the Mainland next year and 2021 will fall to 5.7% and 5.5% respectively.
In respect of Hong Kong stocks, HSBC's quarterly results were less than expected. The market is also wary of other local banks such as Hang Seng Bank (00011) and Bank of East Asia (00023). The short-term share price is under pressure. The quarterly results of the domestic and insurance companies generally outperformed expectations and brought support to the company. The performance of Hong Kong stocks was mixed. The Hang Seng Index was not too weak at around 27,366 points in September. Hong Kong stocks seemed to be consolidating at a high level. The new economy, domestic consumption, property management, road and gas stocks can still be seen in the first line.
Shimao Property (00813) shares rose to a 52-week high and outperformed other similar shares. The Group's land bank is divided into 101 cities, involving 301 projects, with a total area of 64.07 million square meters. As of June 30, the Group's semi-annual turnover was 56.56 billion yuan, an increase of 32.9% over the same period of 2018. The profit attributable to shareholders for the period was 5.105 billion yuan, an increase of 19.5% over the previous year. The Group's contracted sales in September this year was approximately RMB 32.09 billion, representing a 57% increase over the same period last year. The total contracted sales for the first nine months was approximately RMB 173.99 billion, an increase of 44% over the same period last year.



The current price is 40% discount to the asset value
The Group's sales target set this year is 210 billion yuan. The total sales in the first nine months have reached 82.85% of the annual target. The author expects that the chance of exceeding the target for the whole year is quite high. At current prices, the 2019 annual P/E ratio is about 7 times, the dividend yield is about 5%, and the current price is more than 40% discount to its assets per share. The valuation is attractive.
In addition, the Group also has the conditions for the spin-off of hotel and property management business, which will bring additional returns to investors at any time. In terms of positions, this warehouse successfully absorbed 3,000 shares (06110) at a price of 9.39 yuan on Monday. Zhongsheng Holdings (00881) rose to a target of 26.5 yuan on Tuesday (29th) and successfully sold 1,000 shares. earn.
On the other hand, the warehouse is up to 31 yuan or less to absorb 1,000 shares of China Gas (00384), 4.6 yuan or less and then replenish 15,000 shares of China Shipping Property (02669), and to absorb 1,000 shares of Shimao Property at 25 yuan or less.
