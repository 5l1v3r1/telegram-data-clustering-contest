      <p>Krispy Kreme-starved Minnesotans hungry for doughnuts were able to get their sugary fix thanks to an enterprising young entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>Jayson Gonzalez, 21, was able to deliver those sweet glazed doughnuts from Krispy Kreme while spreading joy to deprived Minnesotans one box of doughnuts at a time.</p>
      <p>Krispy Kreme closed its last store in Minnesota in 2008, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">the Pioneer Press said</a> .</p>
      <p>Gonzalez came up with the idea to drive to a Krispy Kreme in Clive, Iowa, to pick up boxes of Krispy Kreme and deliver them to Minnesotans while traveling to Iowa to coach in a soccer tournament, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">according to the Pioneer Press</a> .</p>
      <p>After coming across a Krispy Kreme during his trip, Gonzalez posted to Facebook Marketplace to see if anyone in Minnesota would be interested in getting some doughnuts.</p>
      <p>In just a few days, Gonzalez <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">told the Pioneer Press</a> that he received more than 300 responses.</p>
      <p>Gonzalez did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.</p>
      <p>He launched a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KrispyKremeRunMinnesota">Facebook page called Krispy Kreme Run Minnesota</a> and began to take orders. He would use the page to communicate with customers, and update followers on quantities and pickup locations.</p>
      <p>The account has amassed more than 5,000 followers.</p>
      <p>A box of a dozen original glazed doughnuts from Krispy Kreme starts at $9.49, according to its website. The Pioneer Press said that Gonzalez resells them from $17 to $20 per box, depending on the variety.</p>
      <p>The money Gonzalez makes via his delivery service will be used to help pay for his education at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, where he is studying accounting, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">according to the Pioneer Press</a> .</p>
      <p>The drive from the Twin Cities to Clive is more than 250 miles and takes approximately four hours. A typical run for Gonzalez would start on a Saturday at 2 a.m., when he would begin his 4-hour trek to Iowa to pick up the doughnuts, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">according to the Pioneer Press</a> .</p>
      <p>Gonzalez can fit 100 boxes of doughnuts into his Ford Focus, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">according to the Pioneer Press</a> . Once loaded, he would begin his return trip while alerting his followers of the pickup locations on his route. Most pickups are done in the parking lot of a local Target, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/26/psssst-wanna-buy-a-krispy-kreme-donut-college-kid-drives-them-in-from-iowa-for-a-price/">the Pioneer Press said</a> .</p>
      <p>After 19 successful runs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KrispyKremeRunMinnesota/posts/446545695981420">Gonzalez wrote in a post</a> on his Facebook page that he was told by Krispy Kreme to "shut down operations."</p>
      <p>The company tells CNN that it was concerned that the doughnuts were not meeting its quality standards due to the long drive from Iowa to Minnesota.</p>
      <p>However, after an outpouring of support, the company is now working on a deal with Gonzalez to allow him to become an independent operator.</p>
      <p>"Today, we reached out to Jayson to express our appreciation for his love of Krispy Kreme and admiration for his entrepreneurial spirit," a spokeswoman for Krispy Kreme tells CNN. "We are going to help him achieve his goals, which include being debt-free when he graduates in 2021, in part by selling Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.</p>
      <p>"We wish Jayson great success and we're thrilled to help him achieve it by donating 500 dozen doughnuts when he re-starts his business."</p>
