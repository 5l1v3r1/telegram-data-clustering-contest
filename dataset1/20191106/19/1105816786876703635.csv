Jemima hilariously hits back at JUI-F cleric over WikiLeaks claim
06 Nov 2019, 19:50 by News Desk
Jemima Goldsmith, former wife of Prime Minister Imran Khan and British documentary producer, hilariously responded to Mufti Kifayatullah, firebrand cleric of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), who has claimed that her cousin ‘Wiki’ founded WikiLeaks — a non-profit organisation that publishes news leaks by anonymous  sources.
During an interview with a private TV channel, Kifayatullah had claimed that Jemima’s first cousin named ‘Wiki’ is the actual mastermind behind WikiLeaks.
“Imran Khan, Jemima, the Goldsmith family, Henry Kissinger and WikiLeaks are pieces of the same agenda,” he alleged.



While taking a jibe at the JUI-F leader, Jemima posted a series of tweets on the micro-blogging site on Wednesday and tackled the situation on a lighter note.
“For those who don’t speak Urdu – apparently I have a first cousin called “Wiki” – who set up Wikileaks- which is a Zionist tool, supporting Imran Khan’s Zionist agenda. This from a so called Islamic scholar/ cleric…. “Wiki’ cousin hai Jemima ka”.



“Wait till he finds about my other cousins Panama Leaks and Vicky Pedia,” read her other tweet.



Mufti Kifayatullah is a prominent JUI-F leader who was arrested on October 27 for his provocative statements about state institutions.
However, he was released on bail granted by the Peshawar High Court a few days.
WikkiLeaks was founded by its publisher Julian Assange in 2006 and has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.
