      <p>A U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security">Border Patrol</a> agent fatally shot a gunman who opened fire early Monday near the southern border, immigration officials said.</p>
      <p>The agent was in Sunland Park, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico">New Mexico</a>, about a mile from the border with Mexico and near El Paso, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a>, when he approached a group of four around 6 a.m. One of them pulled a gun and started shooting, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/cbp-statement-november-4-el-paso-sector-shooting">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The agent returned fire, struck the shooter and provided aid until emergency responders arrived, CBP said. The shooter later died at a hospital.</p>
