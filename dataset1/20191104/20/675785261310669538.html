      <p>A dad beat a drug addict to death after he discovered him in his baby daughter's room, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Batterham, 35, is accused in killing Ricky Slater, 34, in 2016 after he was chased from the dad's home in Newcastle, Australia, but he denies murdering him.</p>
      <p>Batterham, an apprentice chef, allegedly pursued Slater for around 330m down the street after he spotted him in the room, which his daughter was not in at the time, around 3.20am.</p>
      <p>Slater had the first of three cardiac arrests when paramedics arrived at the scene at 3.47am, before dying the next day as a result of a lack of oxygen, his trial heard.</p>
      <p>He is said to have been overweight and had a "potentially lethal" level of methylamphetamine in his system at the time of his death, according to reports.</p>

      <p>Wayne Creasey SC prosecuting said Batterham had told police: "Give me two minutes with him. I'll kill the dog."</p>
      <p>Mr Creasey explained a neighbour and police officer Peter Mahon witnessed Batterham punching Slater a number of times in the head while pinning him to the ground with one arm around his neck.</p>
      <p>The court heard neighbour claimed they heard Slater crying out: "I can't breathe. I can't breathe."</p>
      <p>It is alleged Batterham told him: "You motherf***ing piece of s***.</p>
      <p>"How dare you break into my daughter's bedroom. She's only seven months old."</p>
      <p>The court heard Slater stole valuable items from the home, including a purse belonging to Batterham's partner and his daughter's headband.</p>
      <p>Batterham is said to have spotted Mr Slater as he celebrated his birthday with a friend.</p>
      <p>His partner and baby daughter were not at home at the time.</p>
      <p>Mr Creasey said Batterham had had the right to pursue Slater and restrain him until police arrived.</p>
      <p>He added that it was not right to attack him or "exact some sort of revenge".</p>
      <p>Winston Terracini SC defending said he was entitled to chase Slater and to "defend his home and family".</p>
      <p>He also said a forensic pathologist said there were "very little injuries on the deceased man consistent with a violent struggle".</p>
      <p>He added Slater had not been beaten or strangled to death.</p>
      <p>He also is said to have had scarring to his heart caused by regular drug use and suffered from liver disease.</p>
