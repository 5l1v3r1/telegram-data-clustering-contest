So Long, Boyfriend Jeans. It's All About the Girlfriend Top Now.
04 Nov 2019, 20:40 by Savannah Walsh
For decades, women have been sold on the idea of dressing like their boyfriends. From Boyjeans to the shirtdress, traditional menswear restyled as womenswear has a storied history. Now, as culture moves towards a genderless fashion future, male celebrities are flipping the menswear-as-womenswear trend on its head and incorporating silhouettes traditionally reserved for women into their own wardrobes. What was once a radical statement (Mick Jagger in the '70s) and then a punchline (Seinfeld's puffy shirt episode, anyone?) is now a direct line to fresh and dynamic menswear. Tired: boyfriend jeans. Wired: your girlfriend's going out top. Below, some celebs working the trend.
