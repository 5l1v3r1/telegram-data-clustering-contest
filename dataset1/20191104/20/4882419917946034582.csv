Celta Vigo appointed Oscar Garcia as coach on Monday to replace Fran Escriba.
Escriba was sacked on Sunday after a 1-0 defeat by Getafe and it left Celta 18th, on nine points from 12 games.
Former Barcelona player Oscar, 46, has managed several teams, including Premier League sides Watford and Brighton, most recently working with Olympiakos in 2018 - where he left in acrimony.
“Oscar will be accompanied by three assistants and this Tuesday he is expected to lead his first training session,&rdquor; Celta said in a club statement.
