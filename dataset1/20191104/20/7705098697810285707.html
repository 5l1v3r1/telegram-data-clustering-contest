      <h1>Jason Momoa Says Aquaman Won’t Meet Robert Pattinson’s Batman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:39:48+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>The DC Extended Universe has taken some interesting turns this year, particularly with <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/451247-its-official-robert-pattinson-is-the-batman">Robert Pattinson</a> signing on as <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a>. But that doesn’t mean that Pattinson’s Batman and Jason Momoa’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/aquaman"><b>Aquaman</b></a> will be crossing paths anytime soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&amp;v=mRqEC294iZc">Entertainment Tonight</a> recently spoke with Momoa, and he addressed the possibility of the new Batman meeting Aquaman.</p>
      <p>“It would be awesome,” said Momoa. “But I don’t think it’s going to go that way…Let’s just let them do their thing and I’ll do my thing.”</p>
      <p>The DCEU timeline may partially explain this. <b>The Batman</b> will focus on a younger version of Bruce Wayne. And Momoa has already worked alongside Ben Affleck’s Batman in the 2017 <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/justice-league"><b>Justice League</b></a> film.</p>

      <p>Regardless, Momoa shared his excitement to see what Pattinson will bring to the role.</p>
      <p>“I’m really, really stoked,” proclaimed Momoa. “He’s a good man, he’s a great actor. I’m excited about the whole thing.”</p>
      <p>He also had praise for his step-daughter, Zoe Kravitz, who was <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/469384-zoe-kravitz-is-catwoman-in-matt-reeves-the-batman">cast in the film as Catwoman</a>.</p>
      <p>“So proud, it’s perfect casting,” said Momoa. “She’s gonna kill it.” </p>
      <p>Director Matt Reeves is currently working on <b>The Batman</b>, which is set to release on June 25, 2021. Momoa’s return to <b>Aquaman</b> will follow, with the James Wan-directed sequel debuting on December 16, 2022.</p>
