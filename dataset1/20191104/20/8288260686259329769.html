      <h2>While Starbucks keep their seasonal range secret until the launch, these old favourites are rumoured to be making a return</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:19:40+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Many Christmas traditions have stood the test of time - roasting chestnuts, hanging up a stocking and leaving a mince pie out for St Nick.</p>
      <p>But for the modern festive fan - the latest staple of any successful December is a red coffee cup.</p>
      <p>And in Birmingham the countdown is on for Starbucks to return with their limited edition Christmas beverages.</p>
      <p>They will be in stores across the UK, from <b>Tuesday, November 5.</b></p>
      <p>While Starbucks keep their seasonal range secret until the launch, these old favourites are rumoured to be making a return.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On the yuletide list are Gingerbread and Eggnog Lattes, as well as a Toffee Nut option.</p>
      <p>And this year will also see two types of hot chocolate on offer, including Salted Caramel Brownie  and - as a new addition for 2019 - Toasted Marshmallow flavour.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Those who fancy something a little colder, however, can pick from a range of Crimbo-themed iced drinks, like the Salted Caramel Brownie, Gingerbread Coffee and Gingerbread Cream Frappuccino.</p>
      <p>Each store will also have a range of limited-edition reusable cups, each with a wintry theme, to help you do your bit for the enviroment.</p>
