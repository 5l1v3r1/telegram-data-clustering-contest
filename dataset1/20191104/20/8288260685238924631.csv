This weekend, the Irishman was full of praise after one of his acts Kevin McHale gave a strong performance on Saturday night's live show.
Louis decided that Kevin deserved his coveted safe seat pass to send him through to the next live show.
 
But some viewers noticed that before Louis pressed the buzzer, the autocue behind him read ""Congrats through to next week.""
This left some people convinced that the moment was pre-planned.
 
“'Congrats. Through to next week' on the autocue. No so spontaneous eh Louis Walsh? #xfactor #isitafix #celebrityxfactor."" tweeted one viewer.
Another commented: ""Is this that #DanceMonkey song that #kevinmchale is doing?
""Great performance. BUT did anyone notice the autocue was ready to prompt Dermot to say he was through to next week before Louis had even pressed the button?""
