      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> fans are being encouraged to shed the pounds after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox club</a> launched its free app Fit Bears.</p>
      <p>Fit Bears – the first of its kind in Scotland – was released by the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-brilliant-rangers-charity-moment-20540540">Rangers Charity Foundation</a> and will motivate supporters to compete against each other in a fitness league for prizes.</p>
      <p>Launched with support from strikers <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jermain-defoe">Jermain Defoe</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> , the app also enables fans to keep up to date with all the latest news, social media and videos from the club and foundation.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the launch of Fit Bears, the fans who top the fitness league for December and January will win a signed Rangers first team shirt and runners up will win a Garmin Wristband.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/rangers-fans-raise-23k-memory-20458655">Rangers Charity Foundation</a> director, Connal Cochrane, said: “The Foundation is dedicated to using the power of football for good and promoting healthy lifestyles among its supporters and the wider public – something reflected in our community programmes, which are delivered to children and adults throughout Glasgow.”</p>
      <p>Dr Alex Fenton, Fan Fit Founder and Lecturer in Digital Business at the University of Salford Business School, said: “It’s great that Rangers has become the first football club foundation in Scotland to sign up to the app.</p>
      <p>“The aim is to create some friendly competition amongst fans and really encourage them to get moving and do more exercise.</p>
      <p>“We’d encourage all Rangers fans to download it to get club and foundation info and updates but also to join in with the Fit Bears’ fun and experience the features we’ve added.”</p>
