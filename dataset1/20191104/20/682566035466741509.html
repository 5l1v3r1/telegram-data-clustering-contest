      <p>London - <b>Leeds</b> goalkeeper <b>Kiko Casilla </b>has been charged with racially abusing <b>Charlton</b> forward <b>Jonathan Leko</b> during a Championship fixture.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard, 33, is alleged to have made discriminatory comments towards Leko during the match on September 28.</p>
      <p>The Football Association said Casilla, who joined Leeds in January, has until November 12 to provide a response.</p>
      <p>An FA statement published on Monday said Casilla has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that his words "made reference to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin".</p>
      <p>A player found guilty of an aggravated breach of the FA's discrimination rules faces a minimum six-match suspension, which may be increased based on any additional aggravating factors.</p>
      <p>Leeds released a statement saying the Spaniard "strenuously denies" the charge.</p>
      <p>"Kiko strenuously denies the allegation and has proactively worked with the FA during their investigation to date," the club said.</p>
      <p>"The next step of this process will be a personal hearing. In the meantime Kiko will remain available for selection."</p>
