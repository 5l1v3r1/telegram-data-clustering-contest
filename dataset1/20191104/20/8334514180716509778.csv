Parliament elects Labour lawmaker Hoyle as Speaker

04 Nov 2019, 20:49

LONDON (Reuters) - Opposition Labour lawmaker Lindsay Hoyle was elected speaker of Britain’s House of Commons on Monday and will take on the role of refereeing the next parliamentary instalment of the country’s exit from the European Union.
Hoyle, who had been deputy speaker since 2010, was elected by lawmakers after four rounds of voting via secret ballot.
He will take over from John Bercow, who was accused by some of breaking convention and favouring those who wanted to stop the government’s Brexit plans but feted by others who saw him as empowering parliament to challenge and scrutinise the executive.
“I will be neutral. I will be transparent,” 62-year-old Hoyle said after the result, adding: “This House will change but it will change for the better.”
