      <p>Google News has gotten better for polyglots with an update rolling out today. The firm has included a feature that lets users specify up to two languages with one as a primary. This means you’ll be able to select say English (United Kingdom) and French to receive news in both languages without having to switch each time — it’ll appear in your primary news feed. Of course, you’ll still see the news in your primary language first and foremost.</p>
      <p>Google says this feature is available across 141 countries and 41 languages, so you have a decent chance of being one of the lucky ones. The update is available now for users on both iOS and Android.</p>
