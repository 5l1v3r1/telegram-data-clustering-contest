      <h1>Northwest Territories rolls out 911 service for the first time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:13:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Jackie Vandinther, CTVNews.ca Digital Content Editor</a></address>
      <p>For the first time, people in the Northwest Territories will be able to dial 911 if they find themselves in an emergency.</p>
      <p>Before that, residents had to dial a separate local prefix followed by 1111 for police or 2222 for fire or ambulance services.</p>
      <p>The N.W.T. government rolled out the basic service across the territory's 33 communities on Monday.</p>
      <p>The plan had been in the works since 2017, but Bill 31, the <a href="https://www.maca.gov.nt.ca/en/services/9-1-1-nwt">Northwest Territories 911 Act</a>, didn’t pass in the Legislative Assembly until March of this year.</p>
      <p>According to the territory’s Municipal and Community Affairs <a href="https://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/en/files/legislation/northwest-territories-911/northwest-territories-911.a.pdf">website</a>, the service will be available in English, French and, through interpreters, all nine of the territory's official Indigenous languages.</p>
      <p>Those nine Indigenous languages are Chipewyan/Dené, Cree, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tlicho.</p>
      <p>Where a service doesn’t exist or is temporarily unavailable to respond, operators will be able to provide over-the-phone guidance to address immediate health or safety risks.</p>
      <p>The government says at least one operator will be available to answer calls around the clock.</p>
      <p>Yukon implemented a territory-wide 911 service in 2016.</p>
      <p>Nunavut still does not have one.</p>
      <p>The old emergency dispatch numbers are expected to continue working a little while longer while N.W.T. residents adjust to the new service.</p>
