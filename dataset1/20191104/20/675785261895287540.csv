Scarlett, who played Pansy Parkinson in the film series, posted a picture from their wedding day on Instagram .
She dressed in a white corset-style peplum top with a matching mid-length skirt, while leaving her hair sleek and loose around her shoulders.

""We are looking forward to planning our wedding in the coming months where we will celebrate further with our friends and family.""
