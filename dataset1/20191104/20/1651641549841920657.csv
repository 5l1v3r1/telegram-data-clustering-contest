Microsoft introduces Azure Quantum, a full-stack, open cloud ecosystem for quantum computing
04 Nov 2019, 20:00 by Pradeep



At Ignite 2019, Microsoft today announced Azure Quantum, a full-stack, open cloud ecosystem that will bring the benefits of quantum computing organizations. Azure Quantum is a set of quantum services that includes pre-built Quantum solutions, Quantum software and quantum hardware. Microsoft is partnering with 1QBit, Honeywell, IonQ, and QCI to offer a wide variety of quantum solutions, software, and hardware across the industry.
With one program, you’ll be able to target a variety of hardware through Azure Quantum – Azure classical compute, quantum simulators and resource estimators, and quantum hardware from our partners, as well as our future quantum system being built on revolutionary topological qubit.
