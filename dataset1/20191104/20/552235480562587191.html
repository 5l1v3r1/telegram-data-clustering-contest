      <h1>Ryan Kent on his Rangers fitness struggles as winger attempts to curb injury issues</h1>
      <h2>Kent looked back to his best against Hearts after recovering from a hamstring injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:49:25+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Kent has warned <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> ’ rivals there’s still more to come from him.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old winger looked back to his best in Sunday’s 3-0 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> and set up one of the goals.</p>
      <p>But £7million Kent, fit again after a hamstring injury picked up against Livingston in September, said: “ I would probably say I am around 85 per cent at the moment.</p>
      <p>“I am still struggling to do two games in one week on top of training sessions as well.”</p>

      <p>Kent, who was replaced by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-aribo">Joe Aribo</a> in the 66th minute to huge applause from the Gers supporters at Hampden, added: “Me and the physios will be managing myself correctly so I can make an impact on the games I do play.</p>
      <p>“I think my fitness levels are high, as long as I can manage my training time and my minutes like Sunday. That gives me the best chance possible of helping the team.</p>
      <p>“Once I get a run of games under my belt and get into the swing again, I will probably be seeing better performances.</p>
      <p>“But right now my focus is just on maintaining fitness. I can’t really afford to have another injury like the last one.”</p>
