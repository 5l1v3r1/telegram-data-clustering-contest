      <p>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- Starting Monday, drivers traveling on Sunset Boulevard in the West Hollywood area should plan for a longer commute.<br/><br/>Southern California Gas Company started work to upgrade the natural gas main along Sunset Boulevard, between North Crescent Heights Boulevard and North Hayworth Avenue.<br/><br/>"I guess I might see what happens or try to find a different route," said one man who lives in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Drivers will notice lane closures on Sunset Boulevard's westbound lanes. Parking restrictions will also be in effect.<br/><br/>Crews will work Monday through Friday, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The project is expected to last four weeks.<br/><br/>SoCal Gas said people in homes and businesses nearby will likely hear some work-related noise.<br/><br/>Some business managers believe the extra traffic will be a good thing.<br/><br/>"If anything, it's probably going to get better for us because they're going to get stuck in traffic right here," said Charli Phuvuvpa, General Manager of Sunset Car Wash.<br/><br/>People in the area may smell gas, which the company said is normal when crews are working.<br/><br/>Gas service interruptions are not anticipated.</p>
