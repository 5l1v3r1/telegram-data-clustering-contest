      <p>Twitch has lost some big names lately as streamers sign exclusivity deals with other streaming sites. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/1/20750405/ninja-twitch-mixer-exclusivity-tyler-blevins">Tyler “Ninja” Blevins was the first to go</a>, and now streams off Microsoft’s platform Mixer. He was followed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/24/20930650/shroud-moving-streaming-mixer">Mixer by Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek</a> in late October. Now, professional streamer Jack “CouRage” Dunlop has signed a deal to exclusively stream on YouTube.</p>

      <p>Dunlop has accrued over 37 million stream views and 271 million video views during his career. His management company, Loaded, helped negotiate the deal. Loaded is in place to handle sponsorships, media licensing, partnerships, and more. Their participation in this deal may suggest other streamers with Loaded are looking for similar arrangements.</p>
      <p>“This deal with YouTube allows me to create more content and engage with my fans in real time,” said Dunlop in a statement. This pick-up from YouTube signifies that the streaming platform wars are going to only pick up momentum from here. Twitch, the current top dog of streaming, is owned by Amazon. Google and Microsoft are making attempts at building their own sustainable alternatives.</p>
      <p>So far, the streamers who have left Twitch have seen their average viewer count drop. However, as each platform collects their own group of exclusive big name streamers, the metrics could end up shifting in their favor.</p>
