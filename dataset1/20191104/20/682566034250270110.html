      <p>London -<b> Liverpool</b> chief executive <b>Peter Moore</b> says the Premier League leaders have been given assurances that LGBT fans will be welcomed in Qatar for next month's <b>Club World Cup</b>.</p>
      <p>Homosexual acts are banned in Qatar but the European champions have undertaken extensive research and engaged in dialogue with the organisers and various groups to ensure there are no problems.</p>
      <p>"Like most people I had an awareness of many of the issues that Qatar is facing but, as a club, we have gone to great lengths to not only understand them but more importantly engage with those with expertise in the field," Moore told LFCTV.</p>
      <p>"This has allowed us to take on the concerns that have been raised by supporters and others and, as a result, we have received a number of assurances from the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy in Qatar.</p>
      <p>"We have sought and received assurances that our LGBT supporters will be welcome in Qatar, something that was vitally important to us as a club."</p>
      <p>Liverpool have spoken with human rights experts, the British government, LGBT pressure groups and trade unions in order to put together a comprehensive information pack for fans.</p>
      <p>However, Moore said it was not the club's place to shine a light on the issues raised by Qatar's hosting of events.</p>
      <p>"We don't choose the location for the tournaments -- organising bodies make their selections," he added.</p>
      <p>"We are not a political organisation and it is neither our place or our ambition to go from country to country forcing our values and our beliefs on others.</p>
      <p>"If the involvement of our football club, or any other football club for that matter, helps prompt positive change then I would be the first to welcome that, but that shouldn't be the measurement of our involvement."</p>
      <p>Liverpool travel to Doha for a semi-final on December 18 and either a final or third-place play-off on December 21.</p>
      <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is a seven-team tournament featuring the various continental champions plus the league champions from the host nation.</p>
