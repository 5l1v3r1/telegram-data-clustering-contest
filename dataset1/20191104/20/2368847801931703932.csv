鄭中原：習近平急赴上海 變相宣示接班人 要動江澤民侄？

04 Nov 2019, 20:57

中共十九屆四中全會剛落幕，習近平隔天就跑到上海，還到了楊浦區。除了準備出席下星期在當地舉辦的第二屆國際進口博覽會的開幕儀式，還事涉接班人動向，以及四中全會前一樁未及處理的官場大醜聞，或因觸動層級太高，習近平要親自出馬。
中共官方「新華視點」微博11月2日消息稱，習近平2日在上海市考察調研。當天下午，他來到楊浦區濱江公共空間楊樹浦水廠濱江段、長寧區虹橋街道古北市民中心實地考察，瞭解城市公共空間規劃建設和社區治理與服務情況，並同當地居民交談。
從照片上看，除了副總理劉鶴和中辦主任丁薛祥，習的兩名駐在上海的親信李強和應勇全程陪同。
習近平這次在四中全會後的重要節點出行，按說是準備出席下星期在當地舉辦的第二屆國際進口博覽會的開幕儀式，但開幕時間還要到11月5日。而且習此次提前到上海，還特別跑到一個小小的楊浦區察看，用意不尋常。
習近平四中全會後到上海疑變相宣示接班人
首先，這次四中全會後，許多人都笑話那些誰成常委，甚至誰是習近平接班人的消息太假。但是中共黑箱操作的政情難料，萬事無絕對。習這次赴上海，疑似是變相公開欽點的接班人。
在會前盛傳的接班人中，先有親共港媒說是國務院副總理胡春華和重慶市委書記陳敏爾，後據路透社透露的名單，包括是習的三名親信陳敏爾、上海市委書記李強和廣東省委書記李希。習近平2002年至2007年擔任浙江省委書記時，李強與陳敏爾曾與其共事，李強當時是省委秘書長，陳敏爾則是省委宣傳部長。
四中全會公報顯示沒有人事異動，不等於會上沒有經過派系之間的討價還價的博弈，畢竟這是2022年換屆的中期節點，而習近平似乎靠在政治路線衝突中的讓步，同時獲得了政敵在人事方面一定成度的妥協，故此，在四中全會後，馬上就有境外紅媒《中國時報》拋出的一個有望入常的省部級大員名單，將陳敏爾和李強列為兩強，胡春華被排除在外。
此次習近平開完四中全會馬上到上海，要變相宣布李強為接班人選，以及為李強站臺的意味不言而喻。那為什麼不去重慶暗示下陳敏爾呢？其實陳敏爾在四中全會前已經暗示過了，10月中旬，被視為新加坡第四代領導人的王瑞傑到訪重慶，說希望此次會議能為我們（兩國）下一代領導人鋪路。陳敏爾則回應說，通過此次會議，他深刻體會到兩國政治高層的意圖及合作方針。中共大外宣《多維》高調報導了此事，暗示陳敏爾的接班意味極濃。
而如果陳敏爾和李強同為習欽點的接班人（一人會是習為李克強配的），那麼由胡錦濤早年指定，但當上副總理後一直做苦力的胡春華可能沒機會了。當然，習近平現在在領中共走上亡黨末路，三年間或生閃失，最後誰都沒機會了，現在的接班遊戲姑且讓他們繼續玩吧！
上海政壇發生大醜聞牽扯江家 習近平要動「政法王」？
另一個原因，習近平緊急赴上海，也有高度可能是針對最近上海發生的一樁官商勾連色情會所大醜聞，皆因牽扯江澤民家族。
最近上海政壇接連出事，醜聞爆發點剛好在習近平到訪的楊浦區。
從官方報導看，10月21日晚，上海市楊浦法院院長任湧飛被調查。10月23日晚，上海市公安局楊浦分局副局長岑宏權被調查。10月28日，中共上海市楊浦區委前常委、區委政法委書記盧焱被「雙開」並移送司法。盧焱被通報甘當黑惡勢力保護傘，干預司法，大搞錢色交易等。
網路還傳出消息，楊浦區檢察院批捕科科長傳已畏罪自殺。在楊浦區檢察院內也極有可能要被拿下一、二個至少對應二級或三級高級檢察官的人物。
更具爆炸性的消息是，楊浦區存在類似當年福建廈門賴昌星式紅樓的私人高級會所事件，官方起獲的高級會所內部監控錄像視頻，淫亂內容不堪入目，上海市委書記李強在調閱審看過內部監控錄像視頻之後驚得目瞪口呆。目前，開設該座內部高級私人會所的江蘇籍老闆趙國富已被警方控制。
由於官方掌握了偷拍的錄像，牽連一大批高官權貴。一類是與會所老闆趙國富同為江蘇籍的上海某些主要領導。另一類是早先均出道於楊浦區的高官，比如現任中共上海市委常委、市府常務副市長陳寅，中共上海市委常委、市委秘書長、市機關黨工委書記諸葛宇傑，市府副市長宗明以及市府副秘書長金興明等。
第三類是已被掌握曾經出入過該高級私人會所的各級領導人物，包括前任楊浦區委書記陳安傑和現任楊浦區委書記李躍旗，以及楊浦區委副書記兼楊浦區區長謝堅鋼，還包括前後兩任的上海市公安局楊浦分局原局長。
最值得注意的是，江澤民的侄子、前上海政協主席吳志明也是江蘇籍（揚州人），吳志明2002年至2012年曾掌上海政法委長達10年，號稱上海「政法王」，官商界勾連的江蘇幫仗「刀把子」橫行上海，這次上海政法界捲入色情會所醜聞，吳志明當然不能脫身。
上海歷來是江澤民家族的利益地盤，儘管據信習近平和江澤民在中共十九大有妥協，暫時沒有觸動江家，但在中美貿易戰和香港示威抗爭等種種內憂外患之下，中共內鬥變數極大，習近平親赴上海，不排除有秘密任務。因為牽扯到江澤民的層級，以及要端掉整個上海官場江蘇幫，絕非小事。
由此可見，習近平開完四中全會緊急到上海，未必只為進博會開幕走過場，還是為李強站臺宣示接班人，還可能要打大老虎？

Zheng Zhongyuan: Xi Jinping rushed to Shanghai to disguise his successor to move Jiang Zemin?

04 Nov 2019, 20:57

The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee just ended. Xi Jinping ran to Shanghai the next day and went to Yangpu District. In addition to preparing to attend the opening ceremony of the second International Import Expo held in the local area next week, it is also about the succession of the successors, as well as an unsuccessful official scandal before the Fourth Plenary Session, or because the level of the touch is too high, Xi Jinping wants Go out in person.
The official ""Xinhua Viewpoint"" microblog of the Chinese Communist Party said on November 2 that Xi Jinping was inspected and investigated in Shanghai on the 2nd. In the afternoon, he went to the Binjiang section of the Yangshupu Water Plant in Binjiang Public Space in Yangpu District, and the Gubei Civic Center in Hongqiao Street, Changning District to conduct on-the-spot investigations to understand the urban public space planning and construction, community governance and service, and to talk with local residents.
From the photo point of view, in addition to the Deputy Prime Minister Liu He and the Director of the Central Office Ding Xuexiang, Xi’s two relatives in Shanghai, Li Qiang and Ying Yong, accompanied the whole process.
Xi Jinping traveled at the important node after the Fourth Plenary Session. It is said to be attending the opening ceremony of the second International Import Expo held next week, but the opening time will be until November 5. Moreover, Xi went to Shanghai in advance and went to a small Yangpu District to see it. The intention was unusual.
After Xi Jinping’s Fourth Plenary Session, he went to Shanghai to declare a successor
First of all, after the Fourth Plenary Session, many people laughed at the news that those who became members of the Standing Committee and even who were Xi Jinping’s successors were too fake. However, the political situation of the CCP's black box operation is unpredictable, and everything is absolutely non-existent. This time I went to Shanghai, and it was suspected that it was a successor who was publicly hand-picked in disguise.
Among the successors rumored before the meeting, the pro-Hong Kong media first said that the Vice Premier of the State Council Hu Chunhua and the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Secretary Chen Miner, according to the list disclosed by Reuters, including the three confidants Chen Min, Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary Li Qiang and Guangdong Provincial Party Secretary Li Xi. When Xi Jinping was the secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee from 2002 to 2007, Li Qiang and Chen Miner worked with him. Li Qiang was the secretary general of the provincial party committee and Chen Miner was the provincial party committee propaganda minister.
The communique of the Fourth Plenary Session showed that there was no personnel change. It did not mean that there was no bargaining game between factions. After all, this was the mid-term node of the 2022 change, and Xi Jinping seemed to rely on the concessions in the political line conflict, and at the same time obtained political opponents. There must be a compromise in personnel matters. Therefore, after the Fourth Plenary Session, there will soon be a list of promising provincial and ministerial officials thrown by the overseas Chinese media, China Times, which will list Chen Miner and Li Qiang as two. Strong, Hu Chunhua was excluded.
This time Xi Jinping immediately went to Shanghai after the Fourth Plenary Session, and it was self-evident to announce Li Qiang’s succession in the disguise and the position of Li Qiang’s platform. Then why not go to Chongqing to hint at Chen Miner? In fact, Chen Miner had already hinted before the Fourth Plenary Session. In mid-October, Wang Ruijie, who is regarded as the fourth-generation leader of Singapore, visited Chongqing and said that he hopes that this meeting will pave the way for the next generation of leaders of our (two countries). . Chen Miner responded that through this meeting, he deeply understood the intentions and cooperation guidelines of the political high-level leaders of the two countries. The Chinese Communist Party’s ""Out of Multidimensional"" high-profile report on this matter, suggesting that Chen Miner's succession is extremely strong.
And if Chen Miner and Li Qiang are the successors of Xi Qindian (one person will be Li Keqiang's match), then Hu Jintao appointed him in the early years, but Hu Chunhua, who has been working hard since he became a deputy prime minister, may have no chance. Of course, Xi Jinping is now leading the CCP to the end of the dead party. In the past three years, there will be no chance. In the end, there is no chance for the succession game. Let them continue to play!
The big scandal in Shanghai's political arena involves Jiang Jia Xi Jinping wants to move the ""king of politics and law""?
Another reason is that Xi Jinping’s urgent trip to Shanghai is also highly likely to be directed at a recent official scandal involving the pornographic club in Shanghai, involving the Jiang Zemin family.
Recently, Shanghai political circles have been involved in a series of incidents. The scandal broke out just in the Yangpu District visited by Xi Jinping.
According to official reports, on the evening of October 21, Ren Yongfei, president of Shanghai Yangpu Court, was investigated. On the evening of October 23, Yan Hongquan, deputy director of the Yangpu Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was investigated. On October 28, Lu Wei, former member of the CPC Yangpu District Committee and secretary of the Political and Legal Committee of the District Party Committee, was ""opened"" and transferred to the judiciary. Lu Hao was informed of the black and evil forces to protect the umbrella, intervene in the judiciary, and engage in money-based transactions.
The Internet also reported that the Yangpu District Procuratorate had arrested the Chief of the Section and committed suicide. It is also very likely that in the Yangpu District Procuratorate, one or two people who are at least corresponding to the second or third-level senior prosecutors will be taken.
The more explosive news is that there is a private high-level club event in Yangpu District similar to the Xiamen Laichang Star-style Red House in the past. The official video of the senior club’s internal surveillance video, the content of fornication is unsightly, and Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretary Li Qiang has reviewed and reviewed the internal control. After the video, I was shocked. At present, the mainland boss Zhao Guofu who opened the interior private private club has been under the control of the police.
Because the official has mastered the video of the sneak shot, it has implicated a large number of high-ranking officials. One of the main leaders of Shanghai, who is the Jiangsu citizen of the club owner Zhao Guofu. The other category is the senior officials who have previously debuted in Yangpu District. For example, the current Standing Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, the deputy mayor of the municipal government, Chen Hao, the Standing Committee of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and the Party Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Zhuge Yujie, the Vice Mayor of the Municipal Government. Zong Ming and deputy secretary-general of the city, Jin Xingming, etc.
The third category is the leaders who have been in and out of the senior private clubs, including the former Yangpu District Party Secretary Chen Anjie and the current Yangpu District Party Secretary Li Yueqi, and the Yangpu District Party Deputy Secretary and Yangpu District Mayor Xie Jiangang, including The former director of the Yangpu Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.
Most notably, Jiang Zemin’s nephew and former Shanghai CPPCC Chairman Wu Zhiming were also from Jiangsu (Yangzhou). Wu Zhiming was a member of the Haihai Law Committee for 10 years from 2002 to 2012. He was known as the “king of politics and politics” in Shanghai. Jiangsu’s “Knife Handle” is rampant in Shanghai. This time, Shanghai’s political and legal circles were involved in pornographic scandals. Wu Zhiming certainly could not get out.
Shanghai has always been a place of interest for the Jiang Zemin family. Although it is believed that Xi Jinping and Jiang Zemin have compromised at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, they have not touched the Jiang family for the time being. However, under the various internal and external problems such as the Sino-US trade war and the Hong Kong demonstrations, the CCP’s infighting variables Greatly, Xi Jinping went to Shanghai and did not rule out secret missions. Because it involves Jiang Zemin's hierarchy, and it is not a trivial matter to end the entire Shanghai officialdom.
It can be seen that Xi Jinping had completed the Fourth Plenary Session and went to Shanghai urgently. It is not necessarily only for the opening of the Expo, but also for the Li Qiang platform to announce the successor, but also to play the big tiger?
