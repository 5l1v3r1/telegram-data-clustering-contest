      <h1>Paul Blackthorne Will Return For Arrow Season 8</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:03:58+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Almost every major character from <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrow"><b>Arrow</b></a> is seemingly coming back for its final season.  Just days after Emily Bett Rickards’ Felicity Smoak <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/470843-emily-bett-rickards-will-return-for-arrow-series-finale">received confirmation for its series finale</a>, another fan favorite will also return. <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/04/arrow-final-season-paul-blackthorne-returns-quentin-lance/">TVLine</a> reports that Paul Blackthorne will reprise his role as Quentin Lance. However, Quentin was killed off in the sixth season. Regardless, producer Marc Guggenheim explained why they didn’t give Quentin a happy ending. </p>
      <p>“While we could have maimed Lance and sent him off to live with Donna — and that was discussed — I don’t think it would have been true to the spirit of the show, which has never really done that as a general rule,” said Guggenheim. “But (the decision) was hard.”</p>
      <p>At the time, Blackthorne was grateful for his work on the show. He considered Quentin’s death “a beautiful exit, actually…a very nice exit, as exits go!”</p>

      <p>But in the Arrowverse, anything is possible. Fans may also recall how Colin Donnell was able to return this season. He played the Earth-Two version of Tommy Merlyn.</p>
      <p>Now it’s just a question of seeing how Quentin will return — and if <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis On Infinite Earths</b></a> will play a part in that. <b>Arrow</b> is one of the five shows that will be a part of that crossover miniseries. Fans will find out soon enough as <b>Arrow</b> rolls towards its conclusion in 2020.</p>
