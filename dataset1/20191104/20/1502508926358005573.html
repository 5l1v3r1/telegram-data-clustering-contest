      <h1>Boeing tests space taxi; one of three parachutes does not open</h1>
      <h2>Boeing and U.S. space agency NASA said they were still targeting Dec. 17 for the Starliner's first unpiloted mission to the International Space Station.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:44:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>Co said on Monday that one of three parachutes failed to deploy during an otherwise successful safety test of its unmanned CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, being developed to ferry astronauts to and from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Space Station.</p>
      <p>The deployment failure happened during a so-called pad abort test of a system designed to propel the crew to safety in the event of an emergency, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>spokesman Todd Blecher said by email.</p>
      <p>"It's too early to determine why all three main parachutes did not deploy," Blecher said. "However, having two of three deploy successfully is acceptable for the test parameters and crew safety."</p>
      <p>Blecher said overall the test on Monday morning was successful.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>and U.S. space agency NASA said they were still targeting Dec. 17 for the Starliner's first unpiloted mission to the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Space Station.</p>
      <p>NASA has picked Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX as the main contractors to build rocket-and-capsule launch systems to return Americans to the orbiting research lab for the first time since the U.S. space shuttle program ended in 2011.</p>
      <p>Parachute deployment has been among the top technical challenges both <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>have faced that have raised questions over crew safety and pressured launch schedules. The parachutes are designed to slow down the capsules when they return to Earth at supersonic speeds.</p>
      <p>SpaceX is working to fly its Crew Dragon capsule on a first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, after completing its unmanned test in March, the company and NASA have said.</p>
      <p>NASA in a press release called the test "acceptable" and echoed what Boeing said in its statement.</p>
