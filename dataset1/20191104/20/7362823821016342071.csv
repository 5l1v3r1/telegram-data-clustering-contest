A U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a gunman who opened fire early Monday near the southern border, immigration officials said.
The agent was in Sunland Park, New Mexico, about a mile from the border with Mexico and near El Paso, Texas, when he approached a group of four around 6 a.m. One of them pulled a gun and started shooting, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.
The agent returned fire, struck the shooter and provided aid until emergency responders arrived, CBP said. The shooter later died at a hospital.
