川普什麼都推文宣布 紐時爬梳萬則貼文還原推特治國

（中央社華盛頓3日綜合外電報導）距美國2020總統大選進入倒數365天，紐約時報統整、分析了總統川普就任至今1萬多則推文，涵蓋驚天政策發布、直白譙人及自戀讚美等，還原川普「推特治國」風格。
「紐約時報」指出，川普就任後，助他勝選的推特就成為他政治上的一大利器，以及他藉以大肆抨擊的數位版榴彈砲。將近3年下來，川普已把推特徹底整合進了他的政府架構，重塑總統職務與權力的本質。
土耳其過去一個月揮師侵入敘利亞北部後，川普不只透過白宮會議，也利用連串矛盾推文精心加以回應；今年夏天，他用推特宣布對3000億美元中國貨品加徵關稅，加深兩國間緊張。
● 矚目對外政策到炒手下魷魚 全都靠推文
更早的今年3月，川普更是不甩超過半世紀以來的美國政策，透過推文承認以色列對戈蘭高地的主權。他還公開為自己引發的反應沾沾自喜，因為數個月後他在白宮與一些保守派社群媒體人聚會時回憶道「我按出去，就爆炸了，不過2秒鐘我們就搞出突發新聞」。



當川普一有推文的點子，政策會議就遭綁架，政府閣員就得長篇大論替他圓場。川普作為一個常砲口向內的總統，更是喜歡藉推特打破僵局、駁斥或羞辱不聽話的幕僚，甚至對手下先發制人。
川普的白宮顧問康威（Kellyanne Conway）說：「他需要推文，一如我們需吃飯。」
紐約時報檢閱了川普就職後的所有推文、推文回覆及追蹤者，訪談近50名川普政府前、現任官員、律師及推特人員，發現他過半推文－5889則都是在攻擊他人，遠超過其他內容，抨擊的範疇包括通俄案調查、不願向他屈服的聯準會、歷任政府、民主黨主政城市，以及一切惹他不高興的人，從運動員到企業高層都有。
● 過半推文在罵人 8成追蹤者非美國適齡選民
他有2026則推文是在讚美自己、132則在讚美獨裁者，而幹譙盟邦卻有233則。
紐時分析「皮尤研究中心」（Pew Research Center）一份對成年推特用戶的調查，發現川普6600多萬的推特追蹤者儼然是他的私人民調，作為對自身表現的一種肯定，但這些追蹤川普推文者裡面，達投票年齡的美國人竟不到1/5。
2017年初，一些白宮高階官員曾討論過，能否請推特公司將川普推文順延15分鐘露出的可能，但一名前高層官員透露，在意識到新聞界或老闆本人得知消息可能引發的政治後果，很快便放棄這個想法。
後來有包括時任最高經濟顧問寇恩（Gary Cohn）在內的3名貼身幕僚向川普提議，推文發出前應先讓他們過目；川普對此有疑慮，覺得這樣做推文就會錯失先機，但答應先試個一週，結果不到72小時，川普就在私人的高球俱樂部恢復擅自推文而破功。
帕斯凱爾（Brad Parscale）於2016年川普競選時擔任數位總監，現已是川普拚2020連任的競選總幹事。他想讓川普的推文習慣重新回到初衷－與選民連結。
● 2020拚連任 又想藉推文塑形象
雖然有些競選幕僚覺得川普推文易出岔子，但他們也同意推文是個絕佳工具，能呈現出川普有能力、願意挺身對抗所謂政治菁英，以及他常掛嘴上的邪惡民主黨貪腐聯盟、陰謀官僚體制與媒體假新聞。
競選幕僚們尋求繼續塑造川普「接地氣」形象，相信他那種直率、標點符號一蹋糊塗及粗鄙的推文風格，能有別於大多數其他參選人那種刻意修飾、瞻前顧後甚至無關痛癢的社媒作風。
康威認為，推特是川普強有力的武器，能讓他繞開他覺得壟斷資訊已久的其他有力人士。她說：「這是資訊民主化，每個人都能即時接收到川普的推文，無論是家庭主婦、下水道工人，百萬富翁還是跑白宮的記者，全會在同一時間聽到通知聲。」（譯者：陳亦偉/核稿：蔡佳敏）1081104

Trump has a tweet to announce that the New York time to climb the combo is a post to restore the country
04 Nov 2019, 20:07 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd, comprehensive foreign news report) From the US 2020 presidential election into the countdown to 365 days, the New York Times consolidated and analyzed President Trump's inauguration of more than 10,000 tweets, covering the release of the policy, straightforward and narcissistic Praise, etc., to restore Trump's ""tweet governance"" style.
The New York Times pointed out that after Trump took office, the tweet that helped him win the election became a major weapon in his political field, and the digital version of the howitzer he used to attack. For nearly three years, Trump has completely integrated Twitter into his government structure, reshaping the essence of presidential duties and power.
After Turkey invaded the northern part of Syria in the past month, Trump not only responded carefully through the White House meeting, but also used a series of contradictory tweets. This summer, he announced the use of Twitter to impose tariffs on 300 billion US dollars of Chinese goods, deepening the two countries. tension.
● Look at the foreign policy to the speculators, all rely on tweets
Earlier this March, Trump was no less than a half-century US policy, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. He also publicly smug about the reaction he caused, because a few months later he reunited with some conservative social media people in the White House and recalled, ""I pressed it and it exploded, but in 2 seconds we made a breaking news. "".""



When Trump had a tweet idea, the policy meeting was abducted, and the government cabinet member had to make a long story to replace him. Trump, as a regular gunner-in-the-middle president, prefers to use Twitter to break the deadlock, refute or humiliate the obscenity, and even pre-emptive opponents.
Kellyanne Conway, a White House consultant at Trump, said: ""He needs to tweet, just as we need to eat.""
The New York Times reviewed all the tweets, tweets and followers after Trump's inauguration, interviewed nearly 50 former Trump administration officials, current lawyers, lawyers and Twitter personnel, and found that he was attacking more than half of the tweets -5889. Others, far more than other content, include the investigation of the Russian case, the unwillingness to succumb to him, the successive governments, the Democratic Party, and all the people who are unhappy, from athletes to corporate executives. Have.
● More than half of the tweets are swearing. 80% of the followers are non-American electors.
He has 2026 tweets to praise himself, 132 to praise dictators, and cadres to 233.
New York analyzes a survey of adult Twitter users at the Pew Research Center and finds that Trump's more than 66 million Twitter followers are his private polls as an affirmation of his performance. However, among those who traced the Trump tweets, the Americans who reached the voting age were less than one-fifth.
At the beginning of 2017, some senior White House officials have discussed whether it is possible to ask Twitter to post the Trump tweet for 15 minutes, but a former senior official revealed that he was aware of the news or the boss himself may have heard the news. Political consequences quickly gave up on this idea.
Later, three personal aides, including the then top economic adviser Gary Cohn, proposed to Trump that they should be reminded before the tweet was sent; Trump had doubts about it and felt that the tweet would be missed. The first opportunity, but promised to try for a week, the result is less than 72 hours, Trump in the private golf club resumed unauthorized tweets and broke.
Brad Parscale served as the director of the 2016 Trump campaign and is now the campaigning director of Trump's 2020 re-election. He wants Trump's tweet habits to return to the original intention - to connect with voters.
● 2020 is re-elected and wants to use the text to push the image
Although some campaign critics feel that Trump's tweets are easy to scorpion, they also agree that tweets are an excellent tool to show that Trump has the ability, willing to stand up against the so-called political elites, and the evil Democrats he often hangs on. Alliance, conspiracy bureaucracy and media fake news.
The campaign squad seeks to continue to shape Trump’s image of “grounding gas”. I believe that his straightforward, punctuation and sloppy tweet style can be distinguished from most other candidates’ deliberate retouching, after-care and even irrelevant. Social media style.
Conway believes that Twitter is a powerful weapon of Trump, allowing him to circumvent other powerful people who he believes have monopolized information for a long time. She said: ""This is democratization of information. Everyone can immediately receive Trump's tweets. Whether it is a housewife, a sewer worker, a millionaire or a reporter who runs the White House, the plenary hears the notice at the same time.""
