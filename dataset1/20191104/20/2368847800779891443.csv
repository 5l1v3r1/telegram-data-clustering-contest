中美東盟峰會角力 美批北京把海變湖李克強溫和回應

04 Nov 2019, 20:44

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】本屆東盟峰會上，白宮安全顧問奧布萊恩批評中共封鎖南海，威嚇他國，把國際海域變成內陸湖。中共外交部高官和美方針鋒相對，互相指責。而中共總理李克強會見奧布萊恩時，則避開分歧，強調「互利共贏」的美中關係。

中共外交部官員與奧布萊恩交火

第35屆東盟峰會11月2日至4日在泰國舉行。峰會最後一天，舉行了第7屆東盟-美國高峰會。美國代表團帶隊的白宮安全顧問奧布萊恩，在會上批評中共威嚇阻止他國開發南海資源，並暗諷某個「大國」奉行「新帝國主義」以及「強權即是公理」。
隨後，中共外交部副部長樂玉成在場外受訪時，批評「有些國家」已習慣於「干涉亞洲國家之間的合作」。去年以來，中共外交部言辭一向強硬，因此獲得「抗議部」、「斷交部」等稱號。
奧布萊恩當晚也舉行記者會，回應樂玉成的說法。奧布萊恩表示，美國很久以前就已經在亞洲存在，因此美國並不是干涉亞洲事務，而是亞洲的關鍵角色，美國為亞洲做的事情比「有些在亞洲的國家」都多。
他還說，南海是國際海域，美國有出入的自由，不該由「某個國家」大規模封住水域，把海洋變得好像內陸湖一樣，這是違反規則也不公平的。
奧布萊恩再次強調，帝國主義已成為過去，21世紀的國際關係中不應該再存在大國欺負小國的事情，兩國關係應該平等且符合國際法。
他同時強調，川普總統美國追求和中國的良好關係，這對雙方都有好處，但是美國強調公平，如果發生對這個區域或對美國盟友不公平的行為，美國並不怕指出來。

李克強和奧布萊恩強調美中關係

與樂玉成和奧布萊恩的針鋒相對比較，當天李克強會晤奧布萊恩時的談話則相對平和。
李克強在會晤中強調，中美建交40年的交往與合作給雙方和世界帶來「益處」，並呼籲雙方「按照兩國元首達成的共識」，「尊重彼此核心利益和重大關切，在平等和相互尊重的基礎上管控分歧，在互利共贏的基礎上拓展合作，推動中美關係沿着正確軌道向前發展」。
奧布萊恩則表示，美中關係對兩國及世界而言，都是十分重要的雙邊關係，雙方商貿談判取得進展，符合兩國及世界的共同利益。他說，美中雖然存在分歧，但雙方應以建設性的方式妥善處理，推動兩國關係向前發展。
目前美中正在準備簽署所謂「第一階段貿易協議」，因此美方官員在相關言論中都相對溫和。但外界認為，美方要求的結構性經濟改革危及中共「政治安全」，因此北京不大可能真正給予華盛頓經貿對等，即使做出承諾也不會兌現，雙方談判難有實質成果。

China-US ASEAN Summit Wrestling US approval of Beijing to change the lake to Li Keqiang

04 Nov 2019, 20:44

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] At the current ASEAN summit, White House security adviser O'Brien criticized the CCP for blocking the South China Sea, intimidating other countries, and turning international waters into inland lakes. The senior officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the US policy are facing each other and blaming each other. When Li Keqiang, the prime minister of the Chinese Communist Party, met with O'Brien, he avoided the differences and emphasized the ""mutual benefit and win-win"" US-China relationship.

Chinese Foreign Ministry official exchanges fire with O'Brien

The 35th ASEAN Summit was held in Thailand from November 2nd to 4th. On the last day of the summit, the 7th ASEAN-US Summit was held. The White House security adviser O'Brien, led by the US delegation, criticized the CCP for threatening to prevent other countries from developing resources in the South China Sea, and insinuated that a ""big country"" pursued ""new imperialism"" and ""power is justice.""
Later, when the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Communist Party of China, Le Yucheng, was interviewed on the sidelines, he criticized that ""some countries"" have become accustomed to ""interfering with cooperation among Asian countries."" Since last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Communist Party has always been tough, and has won the titles of ""protest department"" and ""disconnection department"".
O'Brien also held a press conference that evening, responding to Le Yucheng's statement. O'Brien said that the United States has existed in Asia for a long time, so the United States is not interfering in Asian affairs, but is a key player in Asia. The United States does more for Asia than ""some countries in Asia.""
He also said that the South China Sea is an international sea area. The United States has the freedom to enter and exit. It is not necessary for a certain country to seal the waters on a large scale and make the ocean look like an inland lake. This is unfair to the rules.
O'Brien once again stressed that imperialism has become a thing of the past. There should be no more big countries bullying small countries in international relations in the 21st century. The relations between the two countries should be equal and in line with international law.
He also stressed that President Trump's pursuit of good relations with China is beneficial to both sides, but the United States emphasizes fairness. If there is unfair behavior against this region or against US allies, the United States is not afraid to point it out.

Li Keqiang and O'Brien emphasize US-China relations

Compared with Le Yucheng and O'Brien's tit-for-tat, Li Keqiang's conversation with O'Brien was relatively peaceful.
During the meeting, Li Keqiang emphasized that the 40 years of exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States have brought ""benefits"" to both sides and the world, and called on both sides to ""respect the core interests and major concerns of each other in equality and in accordance with the consensus reached by the two heads of state."" On the basis of mutual respect, we will manage differences and expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and win-win results, and promote the development of Sino-US relations along the right track.""
O'Brien said that US-China relations are very important bilateral relations for the two countries and the world. The progress of bilateral trade negotiations is in line with the common interests of the two countries and the world. He said that although there are differences between the United States and China, the two sides should properly handle them in a constructive manner and push forward bilateral relations.
At present, the United States and China are preparing to sign the so-called ""first-phase trade agreement"", so the US officials are relatively moderate in relevant speeches. However, the outside world believes that the structural economic reforms demanded by the US endanger the ""political security"" of the CCP. Therefore, it is unlikely that Beijing will truly give Washington a trade and economic parity. Even if a commitment is made, it will not be honored. The negotiations between the two sides will have no substantive results.
