04 Nov 2019, 05:07 by Surin Murugiah
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 4): The Malaysian stock market has seen a relatively small increase in its three-year decline in September, hovering below 1600 points.
At the time of the market, the FTSE KLCI closed at 4.78 points, at 1598.12 points, and it was raised to 1600.65 points.
China's exports in September fell by 6.8% year-on-year to RM77.7 billion, while imports increased by 2.4%. The total trade volume in September was RM147.1 billion, down RM4 billion or 2.7% from a year ago.
There were 276 rising stocks and 250 falling stocks, and another 536 had no ups and downs. The trading volume was 1.44 billion shares, valued at RM865.57 million.
Major rising stocks include Nestle (M) Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Apollo Food Holdings Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, ViTrox Corp Bhd, KESM Industries Bhd, Time Dotcom Bhd, Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.
Popular stocks include Sapura Energy Bhd, Sumatec Resources Bhd, Prestariang Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Uzma Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd and DGB Asia Bhd.

Reuters reported that Asian stock markets rose to a high of more than 14 weeks on Monday, as optimism about Sino-US trade negotiations became more intense, and US employment data performed well, raising the risk appetite of global investors.
MSCI's Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) index jumped 1%, hitting its highest since July 25.
Kenanga Investment Bank Research pointed out that the KLCI fell 4.64 points or 0.29% on Friday, with a gain of 1593.34 points.
""From the chart, the basic trend is still bearish. As the KLCI is below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the overbought signal of the Stochastic, we believe the KLCI may continue to move.""
The research institute said that support levels may see 1550 and 1510 points, while resistance levels are 1630 and 1650 points.
