      <p>KATHMANDU, Nepal -- An overcrowded bus drove off a mountain highway and crashed in a river in Nepal, killing 17 people and injuring 50 more, a police official said Monday.</p>
      <p>The bus was packed with people returning from festivals and appeared to have a mechanical problem before skidding off the highway on Sunday, Police official Madhav Kafle said.</p>
      <p>Among the injured, 21 were still hospitalized Monday for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Kafle said passengers heard a loud sound and the steering appeared to have failed before the bus drove off the highway and crashed in the Sunkoshi River 20 metres (70 feet) below.</p>
      <p>The crash site is about 120 kilometres (75 miles) east of the capital, Kathmandu.</p>
      <p>The bus was crowded because the Tihar festival ended last week and many people were returning back to work from their villages.</p>
      <p>Bus accidents in Nepal, covered mostly by mountains, are blamed on poorly maintained vehicles and roads.</p>
