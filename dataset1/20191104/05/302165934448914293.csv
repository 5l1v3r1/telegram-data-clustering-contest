Chua decided to put a smile on the old folks’ faces by inviting them to his birthday party at a coffeeshop-bistro named 73 Hillcrest.
The news was shared on Singaporean non-profit foundation Happy People Helping People’s Facebook page.
Chua also gave each senior citizen an angpow, red packets containing money are usually handed out during auspicious occasions such as weddings, birthdays and Chinese New Year.
The non-profit foundation thanked the restaurant’s staff and volunteers for helping with the event and spending time with the 36 elderly guests to make them feel special.
