      <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian IT services major Infosys Ltd &lt;INFY.NS&gt; said on Monday it had not yet received any evidence to support the allegations in a whistleblower letter from last month, sending its shares up as much as 6.5% in early trading.</p>
      <p>A letter, claimed to have been written by some employees of the company in October, said Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh asked them and others to bypass approvals for large deals, fearing a negative impact on shares from reduced profit.</p>
      <p>Infosys shares have lost 10% of their value since the letter surfaced. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)launched a probe into the claims, and its Indian counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, asked the company to submit information on the complaints.</p>
      <p>"With respect to the anonymous complaints, there is no prima facie evidence that the company has received until date to corroborate any of the allegations made," Infosys said in a letter dated Nov. 2 to the National Stock Exchange (NSE).</p>
      <p>The exchange had asked the company to explain why it had not disclosed the letter. The Bengaluru-based company said since the allegations were not deemed "material", the company was not obligated to disclose them.</p>
      <p>"If the information in the letter is taken on face value without any investigation, then you can do a grave injustice to the accused, who don't have a chance to defend themselves," said Ramanujam Sridhar, CEO of Brand-Comm, a communications consultancy based in Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>"It would then be trial by media."</p>
      <p>Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani said last month that Parekh and Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy, who was also accused of misconduct in the letter, were recused from the board's investigation.</p>
      <p>The complaints are still under investigation and the company is not in a position to determine "concreteness, credibility and materiality of complaints," Infosys said in the letter.</p>
      <p>Former CEO Vishal Sikka left the company two years ago after a whistleblower complaint. Parekh took over in January last year and laid out a roadmap to revive the company's fortunes, as the sector stared at a slowdown in spending from key clients.</p>
