While speaking at the 2019 World Standards Day Symposium, with theme, “Video Standards Create a Global Stage,” organised by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Katagum urged the participants to develop innovative ideas and take advantage of evolving video technology while adhering to standards.
Katagum said that the standards governing video technology are international and are recognised and respected all over the world. She told the participants that their innovations could introduce economies of scale that help to grow the market and give other innovators the confidence to invest in new video applications and services.
The minister commended the standards agency and assured that her ministry would continue to support the active participation of Nigeria in international standardisation programmes being coordinated by SON to ensure that the country continues to derive optimal benefits from emerging opportunities.
