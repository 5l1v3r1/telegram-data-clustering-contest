      <h1>Next-generation Mahindra XUV500 SUV spotted testing with new details</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T05:25:18+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>The next generation of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mahindra/xuv500-m88/">Mahindra XUV500</a> SUV is expected to be unveiled next year and a new spy video on the internet show that the new SUV could come with quite a few segment-first exterior features, given that it will go up against current favourites, the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/kia/seltos-m782/">Kia Seltos</a> and <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mg/hector-m758/">MG Hector</a>.</p>

      <p>The video shows that Mahindra has taken a more mellow design direction with the new XUV500. There seems to a more restrained body sculpting with more flat surfaces and fewer curves and cuts, even as the SUV seems to have grown in size. The stance seems to have changed quite a bit too, with the SUV now having lost its top-heavy look. Some of the last car's classic touches remain though like the kink in the window line after the C-pillar and a large grille with body-coloured inserts up-front. A notable exterior feature in these pictures seems to be motorised flush door-handles. The rear windscreen is also seemingly more raked with a boot lid that incorporates a cleaner, sculpted look. We expect the interior to be completely revamped too with a cleaner layout and better space management.</p>

      <p>The new XUV500 is expected to be powered by a new 2.0-litre motor that Mahindra is developing for the BSVI norms. This is expected to bring more refinement, efficiency and higher outputs. <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/ford-and-mahindra-come-together-for-a-joint-venture-in-india/">This SUV is also an important cog in the Mahindra-Ford JV.</a> The XUV500 will also spawn a similarly sized Ford SUV for India and other developing markets with unique styling and dynamic characteristics.</p>
