      <p>Two weeks of rain is expected to fall in parts of the UK today, with snow on the horizon.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has issued a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for east Scotland, predicting up to 60mm of rainfall in places.</p>
      <p>The alert started at midnight and will be in force until 11.59pm tonight, with forecasters raising the prospect of flooding.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna said temperatures are set to drop this week, with snow possible in Scotland on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He added: "There's a chance of snow on the mountains in Scotland on Thursday and possibly Friday.</p>

      <p>Mr Petagna said east Scotland will be battered by gale-force winds and heavy rain today, meaning some areas could see almost half the 121mm average monthly rainfall for November in the UK today.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will peak at 13C, although the mercury will stay below 10C in the north of the country.</p>
      <p>Fog could ruin bonfire night for some Brits, with widespread mist and fog expected tomorrow.</p>
