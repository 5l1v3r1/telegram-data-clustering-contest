在香港警察眼裏，根本只剩下一種人
04 Nov 2019, 05:32 by 蕭家怡


我們想讓你知道的是警察眼中只有一類人，就是支持警察的人。



2019年的萬聖節，估計會是我人生中，數一數二難忘的萬聖節，因為在這天，我被與我距離不足三米的香港警察，用長槍指住，大聲喝令：「走啦！」
事緣是這樣的：我和朋友趁著「星期四感謝日」到基隆茶餐廳吃晚飯，飯後，同行友人有事要往鴨寮街的食店走一趟，見反正閒著，就隨她一同前往，怎料走到白楊街與鴨竂街交界時，只見一隊滿身裝備的警員正在撤退，登上廿四座位旅遊巴離開，而在場約有二、三十個街坊（八成人的年齡也是五十歲或以上），大概是為剛在這裏出現的搜捕畫面不滿，滿有情緒地向警員喊道「走啦」、「深水埗唔歡迎你哋」、「死黑警」等等，此起彼落。但我見警員已逐一登車離開，估計也不過是「你有你鬧，我有我走」，遂留在原地，打算警察離開後再慢慢前往目的地；怎料帶頭的廿四座一踩油離開時，本來站在我前方的中年男街坊邊轉身離開、邊罵上幾句，這時候，車上的警員就打開旅遊巴的車門，舉槍對著我的方向，喊了一句：「走啦！」就這樣，一身街坊裝，連口罩都沒有的我，經歷了電影一樣「被槍指嚇」的情節，但可悲的是，我不是在電影裏，而是在現實、平凡得不得了的日常生活當中。
回到家裏，心情稍稍平復，遂跟好友分享這次經歷，然後就是一連串的「痴線」、「痴孖筋」和不解。



不過，今日在臉書上看了城市廣播City Broadcasting Channel（CBC）記錄的短片，片中女警面對現場人士時所說的「返屋企啦唔好扮嘢呀你哋，喺度扮無辜呀！」、「收咗七千蚊做戲呀喺度？」、「唔好扮晒魚蝦蟹呀喺度」，我就明白到：昨晚所罵的「痴線」、「痴孖筋」是多麼的不明狀況，因為呀，在香港警察的眼內，今時今日的香港只有一類人。嗯！我沒有打錯，只有一類人。
這一類人，是支持警察的人——這類人一定不會出現在任何有可能出現狀況的現場，只會乖乖留在家中，或如石房有先生那樣，站在警察的防線後（嗱，不要問我防線在哪裏，我當然不會知道）；至於出現在現場的呢？就統統是「曱甴」：收錢的「曱甴」、搞事的的「曱甴」、扮魚蝦蟹的「曱甴」……總之就是「曱甴」，可以拿起手中的胡椒噴霧大噴特噴。
可以預見，警權過大這問題一日未得到正視和處理，香港就只會出現更多「拉跳舞街坊」、「跪在大堂搜身」，事關在「曱甴論」提出的一刻開始，香港警察的眼內就只剩下一種人；至於會走在街上的你和我呢？抱歉，在他們眼中，不過是一隻隻討厭的，曱甴。

In the eyes of the Hong Kong police, there is only one person left.
04 Nov 2019, 05:32 by Xiao Jiayi


What we want you to know is that there is only one type of person in the eyes of the police, that is, those who support the police.



Halloween in 2019 is estimated to be one of the most memorable Halloweens in my life, because on this day, I was pointed by a Hong Kong policeman who was less than three meters away from me, with a long gun, and said, ""Go!""
The reason is this: My friend and I greeted the ""Thursday Thanks Day"" to dinner at Keelung Tea Restaurant. After dinner, the friends in the same place had something to go to the restaurant in Apex Street. Seeing it anyway, just follow her. When I arrived, I felt that when I arrived at the junction of Poplar Street and Ap Lei Street, I saw a team of police officers with full equipment retreating. They boarded the four-seat tourist bus and left there. There were about 20 or 30 neighborhoods (eight adults). I am also 50 years old or older. I am probably dissatisfied with the search screen that just appeared here. I am full of emotions and shouted to the police officers, ""Go"", ""Shin Shui Shui welcomes you"", ""Dead Black Police"" Wait, it’s up and down. However, I saw that the police officers have boarded the car one by one. It is estimated that it is just ""you have trouble with me, I have me to go"". I stayed in the same place and planned to leave the destination after the police left. How to take the lead in the four-seat When I stepped on the oil, I was standing in front of the middle-aged male street in front of me and turned away and slammed a few words. At this time, the police officer on the car opened the door of the tourist bus and shot the gun in the direction of me. One sentence: ""Go!"" In this way, I am dressed in a neighborhood, and I don’t even have a mask. I experienced the same plot of ""frightened by a gun"" in a movie, but sadly, I am not in the movie, but in reality. Ordinary everyday life.
Back home, I feel a little calmer, I share this experience with my friends, and then I have a series of ""behind the line"", ""Idiot"" and puzzled.



However, today I read a short video recorded by the City Broadcasting Channel (CBC) on Facebook. The female police officer in the film said that when I was facing the scene, ""I’m going back to the house, I’m going to dress up, you’re going to be innocent. ""By the way,"" What an unclear situation, because, in the eyes of the Hong Kong police, there is only one type of people in Hong Kong today. Ok! I have not made a mistake, only one type of person.
This type of person is a person who supports the police - these people will not appear in any scene where there is a possibility of being in the situation, they will only stay at home, or, like Mr. Shifang, standing behind the police line of defense (嗱Don't ask me where the defense is, I certainly won't know it; as for the scene? All of them are ""曱甴"": the ""曱甴"" for collecting money, the ""曱甴"" for doing things, the ""曱甴"" for playing fish, shrimps and crabs... In short, it is ""曱甴"", you can pick up the pepper spray in your hand. Big spray special spray.
It is foreseeable that the issue of excessive police power has not been addressed and dealt with in a day. There will only be more ""drawing a dance neighbourhood"" and ""searching in the lobby"" in Hong Kong. It is about the moment when ""public opinion"" is proposed. Hong Kong There is only one kind of person left in the eyes of the police; as for you and me who will walk down the street? Sorry, in their eyes, it’s just an annoying thing, hehe.
