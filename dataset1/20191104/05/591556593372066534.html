The system has twice the CPU and memory per system. <br/><br/>The second system is the VxRail E560N, which has a all NVMe 1U form factor for high performance workloads.</p>
      <p><b>Dell EMC SmartFabric Services were rolled out to VxRail clusters.</b> The SmartFabric Services automate more than 99% of the configuration steps for multi-rack fabrics. <br/><br/><b>Dell EMC VxRail Analytical Consulting Engine, or ACE, is generally available. </b>ACE is a VxRail management platform that analyzes hyperconverged performance and detects anomalies. ACE also predicts capacity needs.</p>
      <p>VxRail ACE was previewed at Dell Technologies World.</p>
