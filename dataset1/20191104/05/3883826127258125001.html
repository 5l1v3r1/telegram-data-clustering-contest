        <b>Labour has pledged to keep free TV licences for over-75s if it wins power in the 12 December general election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The BBC has said from 2020 only those on pension credit will qualify, after it was made responsible for funding them under the charter agreement.</p>
      <p>Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson told the Daily Mirror the removal of the benefit was "utterly callous".</p>
      <p>It has also been <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10267743/election-boris-johnson-free-tv-licences/">reported that Boris Johnson is looking to save the perk,</a> as part of his election campaign.</p>
      <p>According to the Sun on Sunday, the prime minister has ordered officials to find a way to ensure no over 75s would need to pay as a "priority".</p>
      <p>The BBC and the government have come under fierce criticism over the move to scrap free licences to all people aged over 75, which was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48583487">announced in June.</a></p>
      <p>The decision came after the government made the BBC shoulder the cost of the benefit as part of its funding settlement.</p>
      <p>The corporation said retaining the benefit for all over-75s would have cost Â£745m - a fifth of the BBC's budget - by 2021-22 and led to "unprecedented closures".</p>
      <p>Mr Watson, who is also Labour's deputy leader, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/free-tv-licences-over-75s-20803772">made the party's announcement in the Mirror, saying:</a> "Four in 10 older people say the TV is their main source of company, but from next year 3.7 million older people will lose their free TV licence.</p>
      <p>"It's disgraceful. Our message is clear - vote Labour to save free TV licences."</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49998130">a committee of MPs urged both the BBC and government to find a way to keep the benefit</a>.</p>
