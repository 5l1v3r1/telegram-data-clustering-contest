      <p>With the anticipated hype ahead of the Soweto derby, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs didn't disappoint the audience that packed the Moses Mabhida Stadium to the rafters last week.<br/><br/>Spectators flocked to the Port City dressed in their respective team’s regalia as the Soweto giants pulled the crowd with the supporters in full voice urging their teams to victory.<br/><br/>Two goals apiece were adequate for supporters of both teams to take home. This was a classic derby with all its ingredients. A penalty, a red card, handbags and players being dramatic.<br/><br/>A climax that could never have been scripted for a cinema or TV because it was too far-fetched.</p>

        <b>Can the two teams replicate their display this coming weekend?</b>
