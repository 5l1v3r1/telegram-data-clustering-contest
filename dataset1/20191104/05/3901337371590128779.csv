04 Nov 2019, 05:01 by Shakes lamola
With the anticipated hype ahead of the Soweto derby, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs didn't disappoint the audience that packed the Moses Mabhida Stadium to the rafters last week.Spectators flocked to the Port City dressed in their respective team’s regalia as the Soweto giants pulled the crowd with the supporters in full voice urging their teams to victory.Two goals apiece were adequate for supporters of both teams to take home. This was a classic derby with all its ingredients. A penalty, a red card, handbags and players being dramatic.A climax that could never have been scripted for a cinema or TV because it was too far-fetched.

Can the two teams replicate their display this coming weekend?
