      <h1>Patriots fall to Ravens 37-20, New England will not go undefeated</h1>

      <p>BALTIMORE -- The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots'</a> unbeaten season crashed to an end under the weight of their own mistakes and inability to contain <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> quarterback Lamar Jackson, who ripped apart the NFL's stingiest defense with his arm and legs in a 37-20 victory Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Baltimore (6-2) zipped to an early 17-0 lead and let the Patriots (8-1) creep within striking distance before quelling the comeback with a 70-yard fumble return by Marlon Humphrey and a 5-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Nick Boyle early in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>That made it 30-20, and not even six-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady could bring New England out of the hole. Brady, who went 30 for 46 for 285 yards, threw an interception with 12:47 left.</p>
      <p>Jackson then led a methodical 9 1/2-minute drive that ended with his thrust into the end zone from the 1.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Jackson, the slick second-year quarterback, ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns and went 17 for 23 for 163 yards and a score. Mark Ingram ran for 115 yards, and the NFL's leading rushing attack amassed 210 yards on the ground.</p>
      <p>The Patriots came in with a defense that had allowed only 7.6 points per game and forced 25 turnovers for a plus-17 differential. The defending Super Bowl champions picked up two fumbles, but they had two turnovers themselves and committed a costly penalty that contributed to Baltimore's first touchdown.</p>
      <p>New England was penalized seven times for 48 yards.</p>
      <p>Baltimore's defense played a role, too. Patrick Onwuasor stripped the ball from Julian Edelman in the third quarter and Humphrey took it the other way for a score. Although Brady answered with a touchdown of this own to make it 24-20, the Patriots would not get closer.</p>
      <p>And so ended New England's 12-game winning streak, dating to last season and including the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Ravens opened with a crisp 75-yard drive in which Jackson went 4 for 4 for 41 yards and New England extended the march with an uncharacteristic mistake. As Baltimore lined up for a field goal try, Shilique Calhoun jumped into the neutral zone to give the Ravens a first down.</p>

      <p>On the next play, Jackson skirted around left end for an easy 3-yard score.</p>
      <p>After Brady went three-and-out on his first series, Baltimore rattled off another 11-play drive and added a field goal.</p>
      <p>The third time the Ravens got the ball, a 53-yard run by Ingram set up a 12-yard touchdown burst by Gus Edwards to make the score a stunning 17-0.</p>

      <p>New England punted again, and what followed for Baltimore was a deflating miscue let the Patriots back into it. Cyrus Jones muffed the kick, former Raven Justin Bethel recovered at the Baltimore 20 and Brady tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Mohamed Sanu.</p>
      <p>New England added two field goals in the final 4 minutes of the half, the first of them after Ingram lost a fumble at the Baltimore 19.</p>
