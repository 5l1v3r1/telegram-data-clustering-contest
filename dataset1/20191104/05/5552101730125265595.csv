【綠能大騙局6】遭指控太陽能詐騙吸金　楊大業：我才是最大受害者
04 Nov 2019, 05:47 by 社會組
遭人指控以「太陽能種電計畫」，讓許多投資人受害的富柏公司負責人楊大業，今（4）日致電本刊表示：「教育有教育的理念，我們是很負責的在處裡這件事情，當初施慶鴻是我們產品部門找的，我是教育部門與他們沒有關聯，但我是當時的負責人沒錯，所以我也概括承受；當施慶鴻來找我們合作時，我們公司當初評估ok，但施慶鴻後續沒有蓋設工廠，我們完全不了解太陽能的世界，他們到底有沒有執行電廠的設立，與我們無關。」
楊又提到「學員來這邊上課的時候，我們所教的財商課程是正確且專業的，學員們要投資太陽能，也是施慶鴻的公司跟他們簽約的，與我們無關。」
至於爆料人所指控的抽傭部分，楊大業無奈的說「確實本來有約定，當案子結束後施會發放佣金給我們，但目前為止都沒有完成，所以沒有拿到任何佣金，
總而言之，我們截至目前為止都沒有拿到施慶鴻任何佣金。」
楊更進一步指出「其實我公司大概也投資了三千萬元，案發後富柏並幫成員成立了自救會，與現在爆料的自救會無關，有些學員選擇相信，有些選擇不相信，我們聯合了27個受害者一起對施慶鴻提告詐欺，我們真的也是受害者。」
至於前台南縣長蘇煥智所提到對施有強制、恐嚇等行為，楊表示「我們只是代表學員去向施慶鴻公司要錢，卻被施提告，最後也是不起訴處分。」
楊悻悻然的說，「這兩年施慶鴻讓我們公司倒閉，我才是最大的受害者，而且本案至今已盡兩年，我們懷疑背後有人使力延遲開庭，我們也是完全沒輒。」
楊最後表示「我們秉持教育的信念，兼五份工作，就是為了對學員負責，希望貴刊能給予平衡報導。」

[Green Energy Big Scam 6] Accused of solar fraud fraud Yang Daye: I am the biggest victim
04 Nov 2019, 05:47 by Social Group
Yang Daye, the head of Fubo Company, who was accused of ""solar electricity metering"" and caused many investors to suffer, called this magazine today (4): ""Education has the concept of education, we are very responsible in the office. This thing, when Shi Qinghong was found by our product department, I was the education department and they were not related to them, but I was the person in charge at the time, so I also generalized it; when Shi Qinghong came to us for cooperation, our company initially evaluated ok However, Shi Qinghong did not set up a factory in the follow-up. We did not understand the world of solar energy at all. Whether they have implemented the power plant or not has nothing to do with us.""
Yang also mentioned that ""when students come to class here, the financial business courses we teach are correct and professional. The students have to invest in solar energy. It is also the company of Shi Qinghong who signed with them and has nothing to do with us.""
As for the rake commissioned by the person who broke the news, Yang Daye reluctantly said, ""There was an agreement. After the case was over, the commission will be given to us, but it has not been completed so far, so no commission has been obtained.
All in all, we have not received any commission from Shi Qinghong so far. ""
Yang further pointed out that ""in fact, our company probably invested about 30 million yuan. After the incident, Fubai and the members set up a self-help meeting. It has nothing to do with the self-help meeting that broke the news. Some students choose to believe, some choose not to believe, we unite Twenty-seven victims have swindled against Shi Qinghong, and we are really victims.""
As for the front-end South County Governor Su Huanzhi mentioned the acts of coercion and intimidation, Yang said, ""We only asked the students to ask for money from Shi Qinghong, but they were told, and finally they did not sue.""
Yang Xiaoran said, ""In the past two years, Shi Qinghong has caused our company to close down. I am the biggest victim, and the case has been two years since then. We suspect that there are people behind the delay in the court, and we are completely devoid of it.""
Yang finally said that ""we believe in education and have five jobs in order to be responsible to the students. I hope that your magazine can give a balanced report.""
