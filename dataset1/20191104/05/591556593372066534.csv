Dell Technologies updated its VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure system with new platforms designed for SAP HANA and similar workloads, multi-cluster deployments and enhanced management analytics.The Dell EMC VxRail additions were announced at VMworld Europe.


Hyperconverged systems revenues reached $1.8 billion in Q2


What is hyperconvergence? Here's how it works and why it matters


The updates include:Dell EMC VxRail has two new NVMe-based systems with 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. The first system is the  VxRail P580N, which is a all NVMe four-socket system for SAP HANA workloads. The system has twice the CPU and memory per system. The second system is the VxRail E560N, which has a all NVMe 1U form factor for high performance workloads.
Dell EMC SmartFabric Services were rolled out to VxRail clusters. The SmartFabric Services automate more than 99% of the configuration steps for multi-rack fabrics. Dell EMC VxRail Analytical Consulting Engine, or ACE, is generally available. ACE is a VxRail management platform that analyzes hyperconverged performance and detects anomalies. ACE also predicts capacity needs.
VxRail ACE was previewed at Dell Technologies World.
