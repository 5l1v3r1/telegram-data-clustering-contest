      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 4 — Kawhi Leonard shook off a slow start and scored 25 of his 30 points in the second half to spark the host Los Angeles Clippers to a 105-94 victory over the Utah Jazz last night.</p>
      <p>Leonard scored 18 points in the fourth quarter to help the Clippers hold off the Jazz. He made just 9 of 26 shots from the floor and only 2 of 8 on 3-pointers, but his solid performance in the second half lifted Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Montrezl Harrell scored 19 points and pulled down eight rebounds, including six offensive boards, for the Clippers (5-2). Lou Williams added 17 points, while Ivica Zubac chipped in 11 points and nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz (4-3) with 36 points. Bojan Bogdanovic finished with 19 points. Rudy Gobert had 12 points and 14 rebounds.</p>
      <p>Two free throws by Mitchell cut the Clippers’ lead to 91-90 with 2:58 remaining. But a 3-pointer by JaMychal Green, who had 12 points, four free throws by Leonard and two more by Harrell allowed the Clippers to clinch the win.</p>
      <p>In the third, the Jazz grabbed a 61-51 lead after a tip-in by Tony Bradley with 3:55 remaining in the quarter. But the Clippers cut the deficit to 69-65 to end the third.</p>
      <p>After a Bradley dunk gave Utah a 24-20 edge less than two minutes into the second quarter, the Clippers answered with a 16-0 run, capped by Landry Shamet’s 3-pointer for a 36-24 advantage with 4:57 left.</p>
      <p>However, the Jazz ended the quarter on a 17-3 surge to seize a 41-39 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>The Clippers outrebounded the Jazz 54-37, including 18-6 on the offensive end. Neither team shot well, with the Jazz connecting on 39.7 per cent of their shots compared to 39.1 for the Clippers.</p>
      <p>The Jazz played without reserve guard Emmanuel Mudiay, who had tightness in his left hamstring. Centre-forward Ed Davis also missed the game after sustaining a fractured left fibula in the team’s loss to the Sacramento Kings on Friday. Davis is expected to miss at least a month. — Reuters</p>
