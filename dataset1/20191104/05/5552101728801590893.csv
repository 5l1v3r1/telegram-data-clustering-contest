前閣揆毛治國搭獨董熱門話題便車　重出江湖
04 Nov 2019, 05:35 by 林俊宏, 鄒保祥
即將在本週召開籌設大會的「台北市獨立董事協會」搭獨董便車？與去年籌備、今年1月初才成立的「中華獨立董事協會」同樣以獨立董事為訴求！台北市獨立董事協會發起人的背景頗有來歷，包括前行政院院長毛治國、前副總統連戰之子連勝武等人，毛治國在選舉前即盛傳內定為新協會的理事長。
台北獨立董事協會籌備過程引起不小騷動，因為連日來，包括主管該協會設立的台北市社會局收到申訴書，內容大意是指稱設置獨立董事目的事業主管機關在金管會，台北獨立董事協會卻跑到台北市申請成立，有迴避中央審查之嫌。
此外，該協會許多幹部都是香港獨立董事協會所指派，台北獨立董事協會恐成為香港獨董協會的「台北分會」？連發起人代表的毛治國、蕭子昂、邱育揚及周宏雋等人都被內部質疑沒有獨立董事資歷。有該協會的發起人表示，協會應以專業掛帥，而非政治掛帥，由不具獨董資歷的人來籌組獨董協會，而且還沒召開會員大會就已經內定為理事長、祕書長等職務，引起台北獨董協會發起人的熱議與不平，表示不公平。
不過，本刊查證時，毛治國向本刊說，他有擔任過獨立董事的資歷，但本刊進一步追問是在哪家公司擔任過獨董？毛治國沒明說，僅強調「我當然當過獨董，這一切都還在過程中」即掛掉電話，經本刊查證，毛過去未曾有擔任過獨立董事職務的資歷。
此外，該協會強調，近期將召開籌備大會，主管機關社會局也會派員出席，等到會議完成後，還會再召開會員大會，屆時會再對外公開協會成立的理念。
今年初成立的中華獨董協會，協會理事長駱秉寬曾是香港獨董協會的副會長，駱秉寬年初曾寫信向香港獨董協會會員直言，因香港獨董協會希望中華獨董協會有1/3理監事由香港的理監事擔任，且香港的會長要出任台灣的榮譽理事長，加上協會大部分理監事都反對，認為協會應有其自主性 ，因此請辭副會長職務。

The former cabinet, the ruling of the country, the country, the topic of Dong, the hot topic, the car, the river
04 Nov 2019, 05:35 by Lin Junhong, Zou Baoxiang
The ""Taipei Independent Directors Association"", which will hold a conference this week, will take the independent director’s car. The ""China Independent Directors Association"", which was established last year and was established in early January this year, is also an independent director. The background of the sponsors of the Taipei Independent Directors Association has a lot of background, including Mao Zhiguo, former president of the Executive Yuan, and Lian Shengwu, the son of Lien Chan, the former vice president. Mao Zhiguo was appointed as the chairman of the new association before the election.
The preparatory process of the Taipei Independent Directors Association caused a lot of turmoil, because in the past few days, the Taipei Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which was set up by the association, received a complaint. The content of the complaint was that the competent authority for setting up independent directors was in the financial management committee, but the Taipei Independent Directors Association. When I went to Taipei to apply for the establishment, I was shunned by the central review.
In addition, many of the association's cadres are appointed by the Hong Kong Independent Directors Association. The Taipei Independent Directors Association may become the ""Taipei Branch"" of the Hong Kong Independent Board Association. Even Mao Zhiguo, Xiao Ziang, Qiu Yuyang and Zhou Hongqi, who are the representatives of the promoters, have been internally questioned without the qualifications of independent directors. The founder of the association said that the association should be a professional leader, not a political leader. The independent directors should be organized by people who do not have the qualifications of the independent directors, and they have already been appointed as the chairman and secretary-general without holding a general meeting. It caused the hot discussion and injustice of the sponsors of the Taipei Independent Board Association, indicating that it was unfair.
However, at the time of this issue, Mao Zhiguo told the journal that he had qualified as an independent director, but the journal further questioned which company was the independent director. Mao Zhiguo did not say that he only stressed that ""I certainly have been an independent director, and this is still in the process."" That is, the phone was hanged. According to the investigation, Mao has never had the qualifications of an independent director.
In addition, the association stressed that the preparatory conference will be held in the near future, and the social bureau of the competent authority will also send staff to attend. After the completion of the conference, the general assembly will be held again, and the concept of the association will be publicized.
Luo Bingkuan, chairman of the Association of Independent Chinese Associations established at the beginning of this year, was the vice president of the Hong Kong Independent Board Association. Luo Bingkuan wrote a letter to the Hong Kong Independent Board Association at the beginning of the year, because the Hong Kong Independent Board Association hopes that the Chinese Independent Board Association will have 1/3 The board of supervisors is the supervisor of Hong Kong, and the president of Hong Kong is to be the honorary chairman of Taiwan. Most of the supervisors of the association object to it and believe that the association should have its autonomy.
