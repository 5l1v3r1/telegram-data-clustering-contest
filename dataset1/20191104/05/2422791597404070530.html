      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Krispy Kreme has reached an agreement with a Minnesota college student who drove to Iowa every weekend to buy hundreds of doughnuts to resell them in the Twin Cities area.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/krispykreme/status/1191533395681173504">The company said in a statement</a> Monday that Jayson Gonzalez of Champlin can now work with Krispy Kreme as an independent operator. The deal also includes a 500-dozen doughnut donation when he starts up again.</p>
      <p>The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports the 21-year-old Gonzalez also announced the deal on his Facebook page, adding that he's "pumped" to continue his business.</p>
      <p>Last week, Krispy Kreme told Gonzalez to stop the resell venture because it created a liability for the company.</p>
      <p>The confectionary giant said in its statement Monday that the "temporary stoppage" was to ensure product quality and regulatory compliance.</p>
