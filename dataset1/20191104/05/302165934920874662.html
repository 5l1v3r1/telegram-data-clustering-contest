      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 4 — Despite having a hectic schedule, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad today said he will campaign for Pakatan Harapan (PH) in the upcoming Tanjung Piai by-election once he returns to Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The prime minister who is also chairman of Bersatu — which is fielding Karmaine Sardini as its candidate for the parliamentary poll — is currently in the Thai capital for the 35th Asean Summit and related meetings with a host of other countries including China, India, Australia and the US.</p>
      <p>“I will, at least once,” he told Malaysian media briefly after attending the Asean+3 meeting this morning.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir was asked if he would be campaigning in the Johor parliamentary seat of Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>The prime minister will be flying back to Malaysia later tonight. He was initially scheduled to depart Bangkok tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>The previous Tanjung Piai MP Datuk Dr Md Farid Md Rafik had also been from Bersatu.</p>
      <p>The by-election was triggered by Dr Farid’s death from heart complications on September 21.</p>
      <p>Karmaine will be facing off against five others. </p>
      <p>Barisan Nasional is fielding Datuk Seri Wee Jack Seng from component party MCA.</p>
      <p>The past two-term Tanjung Piai MP was narrowly defeated by Dr Farid in last year’s general election, despite clamour from ally Umno for one of their own to contest the seat.</p>
      <p>Islamist party PAS, which is allied to Umno in a separate pact, has thrown its weight beyond the ethnic Chinese runner, despite its demands elsewhere for Malay Muslims to reassert their dominance.</p>
      <p>A PAS ally, Berjasa has sent in its president Datuk Badrulhisham Abdul Aziz. while former BN component, Gerakan chose to field Wendy Subramaniam.</p>
      <p>Two others, Ang Hock Chuan and Faridah Armani Abdul Ghaffar, are standing as independents.</p>
