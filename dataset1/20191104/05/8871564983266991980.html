      <p>A construction worker died this morning at the site of a new Tan Tock Seng Hospital rehabilitation facility after a tower crane boom came crashing down from the 10th floor level.</p>
      <p>Another worker was injured and has been taken to the hospital, emergency responders told <i>Coconuts Singapore </i>today.<i> </i></p>
      <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for assistance along Jalan Tan Tock Seng at about 8:50am, and first-responders pronounced the man dead at the scene. They did not disclose the victims’ ages, names, or nationalities. </p>
      <p>Workers on site <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/crane-collapses-at-novena-worksite">told reporters</a> the man who died was an Indian national, while the other was from Bangladesh and injured his leg in the incident. </p>
      <p>An eyewitness reportedly saw that the worker was stuck atop the broken crane and had spent about 20 minutes trying to climb his way down, without elaborating further. </p>
      <p>A photo of the scene posted to Facebook shows a worker wearing a uniform <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sma.Black.Jet.Rocky/posts/230793137889751">lying motionless</a> on the ground. Videos also show the crane tower bent following the collapse of its boom.</p>
