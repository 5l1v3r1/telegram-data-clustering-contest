      <p><b>BALTIMOREÂ (AP)</b> - The New England Patriots' unbeaten season crashed to an end under the weight of their own mistakes and inability to contain Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson.</p>
      <p>Jackson ripped apart the NFL's stingiest defense with his arm and legs, accounting for three touchdowns and directing a dominant running game in a 37-20 victory Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Baltimore (6-2) zipped to an early 17-0 lead and let the Patriots (8-1) creep within striking distance before quelling the comeback with a 70-yard fumble return by Marlon Humphrey and a 5-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Nick Boyle early in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>That made it 30-20, and not even six-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady could bring New England out of the hole. Brady, who went 30 for 46 for 285 yards, threw an interception with 12:47 left.</p>
      <p>Jackson then led a methodical 9 1/2-minute drive that ended with his thrust into the end zone from the 1, with no small assist to right tackle Orlando Brown Jr.</p>
      <p>"I was hoping I was in. Orlando pulled me," Jackson said. "I didn't even know it was him until I got up. He was like, 'I pulled you in. I need half of that touchdown.' It was cool."</p>
      <p>Jackson, the slick second-year quarterback, ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns and went 17 for 23 for 163 yards and a score. Mark Ingram rushed for 115 yards, and the NFL's leading ground attack amassed 210 yards.</p>
      <p>"We played tonight like it was a championship game," Jackson said after Baltimore's fourth straight victory. "We've just got to keep going."</p>
      <p>New England mixed up its coverages and blitz packages, and the Ravens responded accordingly.</p>
      <p>"Nobody does it better than they do, and I thought our guys handled it really well, starting with the quarterback," Ravens coach John Harbaugh said.</p>
      <p>The Patriots came in with a defense that had allowed only 7.6 points per game and forced 25 turnovers for a plus-17 differential. The defending Super Bowl champions picked up two fumbles, but they had two turnovers themselves and committed a costly penalty that contributed to Baltimore's first touchdown.</p>
      <p>New England was penalized seven times for 48 yards.</p>
      <p>"We didn't do anything well enough to deserve to win," Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. "We've all just got to do a better job."</p>
      <p>Baltimore's defense played a role, too. Patrick Onwuasor stripped the ball from Julian Edelman in the third quarter and Humphrey took it the other way for a score. Although Brady answered with a touchdown of his own to make it 24-20, the Patriots would not get closer.</p>
      <p>And so ended New England's 13-game winning streak, dating to last season and including the playoffs.</p>
      <p>"We did a lot of things (wrong) we need to do better," Belichick said, his voice barely louder than a whisper.</p>
      <p>The Ravens opened with a crisp 75-yard drive in which Jackson went 4 for 4 for 41 yards and New England extended the march with an uncharacteristic mistake. As Baltimore lined up for a field goal try, Shilique Calhoun jumped into the neutral zone to give the Ravens a first down.</p>
      <p>On the next play, Jackson skirted around left end for an easy 3-yard score .</p>
      <p>After Brady went three-and-out on his first series, Baltimore rattled off another 11-play drive and added a field goal.</p>
      <p>The third time the Ravens got the ball, a 53-yard run by Ingram set up a 12-yard touchdown burst by Gus Edwards to make the score a stunning 17-0.</p>
      <p>New England punted again, and what followed for Baltimore was a deflating miscue let the Patriots back into it. Cyrus Jones muffed the kick, former Raven Justin Bethel recovered at the Baltimore 20 and Brady tossed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Mohamed Sanu.</p>
      <p>New England added two field goals in the final 4 minutes of the half, the first of them after Ingram lost a fumble at the Baltimore 19.</p>
      <p>"Here they come roaring back and we make a couple mistakes," Harbaugh noted. "They made some mistakes, too. It was that kind of a football game."</p>
      <p>NOTEWORTHY</p>
      <p>New England fell to 8-2 vs. Ravens in regular season (Brady is 6-2). ... Baltimore is 10-2 after a bye under Harbaugh, who took over in 2008. ... Ravens are 68-24 at home under Harbaugh, including 21-4 in November. ... Patriots rookie WR N'Keal Harry was inactive after coming off IR (ankle) and being added to 53-man roster Saturday.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Patriots: New England heads into a bye and will return in two weeks to face Philadelphia on the road in a rematch of the 2017 Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Ravens: Baltimore faces winless Cincinnati on the road next Sunday. The Ravens beat the Bengals 23-17 last month.</p>
