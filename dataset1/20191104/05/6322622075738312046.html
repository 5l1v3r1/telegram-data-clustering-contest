      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): <a href="http://theedgemarkets.com/">theedgemarkets.com</a> highlighted seven stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia's afternoon close today. Three stocks had positive momentum while four showed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>Stocks with positive momentum were:</p>
      <p>Censof Holdings Bhd – up one sen to 14 sen</p>
      <p>DGB Asia Bhd – up one sen to 17 sen</p>
      <p>Techfast Holdings Bhd – up four sen to 43 sen</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Luster Industries Bhd – up 1.5 sen to 10 sen</p>
      <p>Minetech Resources Bhd – unchanged at nine sen</p>
      <p>Prestariang Bhd – up two sen to 54 sen</p>
      <p>Teck Guan Perdana Bhd – up five sen to RM1.14</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally only persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
