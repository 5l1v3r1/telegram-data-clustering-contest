推動台灣產業儀器設備自主化契機，儀科中心為國內半導體業準備的關鍵底牌
04 Nov 2019, 05:02 by 廣編企劃


我們想讓你知道的是為推動科技產業升級，財團法人國家實驗研究院致力於推動國內科技人才培育及創新研發，發揮槓桿作用，近年除與學術界積極合作，提供解決方案以外，也轉向產業界希望作為學研與產業間的平台，創造共生共榮的各領域生態系。10月7日集齊台灣半導體研究中心、國家高速網路與計算中心、台灣儀器科技研究中心共同展出智慧領域技術成果，吸引廣大業界與學界共襄盛舉，希冀藉由這樣的機會，讓更多產學研界能認識國研院在研發平台服務所做的努力及見證近年國研院引領的技術革新。



國際半導體產業協會 SEMI 預測未來 3-5 年的半導體產業有巨大的晶片需求及市場機會，但技術的挑戰甚大，藉由不同技術、不同功能、 不同材料間的異質整合創新及創造高附加價值之終端產品。而台灣半導體市場達 2.62 兆台幣，排名世界第三，今年年有機會重回第二，如何達成創新研發，將是台灣維持領先的重要決勝點。
台積電在今年靠著七奈米製程的領先，擠進了 2019 年上半年第三大半導體製造商，但台灣在半導體相關產業的突破還有個重要的環節沒有解決：設備。半導體先進製程的設備領域長期被少數大廠壟斷，諸如光刻機龍頭ASML以及物理氣相沉積 (PVD) 設備龍頭AMAT分別佔據了細分市場上75.3%和84.9%的市佔率，這代表台灣設備廠縱然為了更先進的技術，更龐大的市場份額而進行投資，亦會將龐大的預算外流至國外廠商，而難以在台灣國內達成產業成長縱效，2017 年，台灣半導體設備投資創造了超過 5000 億需求，但國內自給率僅 12%。
在這個環境下，儀科中心成為了台灣設備自產最重要的核心單位，由於擁有台灣目前唯一的大口徑光學鏡片研製技術，提供完整的光學系統客製服務平台，可協助產學研界理工醫農各領域， 開發前瞻研究所需的客製化特殊光學元件與儀器設備。也因此儀科中心有能力研發、設計最先進的高科技製造設備，包含先進封裝製程用的半導體曝光機、電漿輔助原子層沉積系統，以及原子層蝕刻等相關設備，在國內先進製造設備的研發與製造上成為國內企業的最佳幫手。儀科中心陳峰志副主任表示，「儀科中心最主要的業務就是利用獨有的設備與技術，協助廠商開發目前市面上「不存在」的設備，根據客戶的需求設計符合需求，並藉此協助台廠降低生產成本，拉高產品良率，進而拉抬在國際上的競爭力。」

儀科中心獨創的「黑科技」：國內自研自製先進製程設備
會後，儀科中心也帶領與會者參訪近年與國內企業在半導體、生醫、航太等多個產業共同努力的成果，其中國內第一部自研自製原子層蝕刻（Atomic Layer Etching, ALE） 設備原型也於當天首度對外曝光！ALE 設備專注研發氮化鎵研製次世代半導體電力元件，作為製作微小結構「精準蝕刻」最佳工具，可應用在半導體製造業的特殊先進製程步驟。自研自製設備開發過程中使用本國零組件為主，在產業鏈上深耕在地。這套 ALE 儀器具備可彈性調整零組件、維修成本低及帶動國內相關產業上下游發展的全方位優勢。
陳峰志表示，「儀科中心的核心技術就是光學、真空跟光機電系統整合，業界夥伴和學界夥伴了解我們的核心技術，根據他們的需求去打造儀器。」例如國內與全球最大晶片微影設備商艾司摩爾的商業案，就是儀科中心和台灣機械廠合作的成功案例，儀科中心透過光學的專業，協助機械廠打造先進機械，拿下艾斯摩爾的訂單。「我相信如果可以找到民間廠商合作，這些廠商會優先去找民間廠商，但會來找我們就是因為民間廠商沒有辦法做到這樣的研發，所以才需要靠儀科中心協助」，甚至台灣廠商其實並不願意讓業界知道他們與儀科中心合作研發「他們都覺得這是一種 KNOWHOW 了」陳副主任笑說。

同時，儀科中心在原子層沉積 (Atomic Layer Deposition, ALD) 設備也有相關成績，透過儀科中心研究的12 吋矽晶圓之電漿輔助原子層沉積 (Plasma Enhanced ALD, PEALD) 系統新技術，可以解決傳統物理氣相沉積 (Physical Vapor Deposition, PVD) 製作大曲率樣品厚度不均問題，傳統 PVD 技術難以在非光滑表面上完成均勻覆蓋的薄膜，透過儀科中心的 ALD 新技術，可以完成 100% 階梯覆蓋率的光學薄膜，改善過往大面積大曲率樣品的鍍膜均勻性問題，進而提高成像解析度。2015 年，儀科中心更與台積電等產學機構共同成立「原子層沉積聯合實驗室」，進一步提供半導體製造業 ALD 製程設備測試與開發驗證的服務平台。

因應產業在有限的設備預算上，儀科中心也可以做到多方面支援各種前瞻研究，並因應需求進行設備升級改良，創造台灣產業儀器設備自主化的能量與契機，並整合整體產業鏈，提高國內儀器設備產業的整體活力與動能。
不只半導體：儀科中心聯手醫界、學界，開發連骨頭都能「印」出來的先進醫材
另外，儀科中心近年也切入醫材設備，經過多年努力，先後完成了符合國際醫材法規之 ISO 13485 的醫療器材品質系統環境，生物相容性驗證服務平台、電性安規驗證實驗室也得到 ISO 10993 認證，並打造了國內第一個手術導引可用性法規環境平台，就是看中台灣今年上看 1206 億台幣的醫材市場，並計畫藉由完整的平台協助廠商切入國際市場，透過連結台灣產、學界的資源與能量，縮短生技醫材產品原型開發時程，協助台灣新創事業創造醫材殺手級應用的目標。

如與臺北醫學大學及三鼎生技共同合作開發的生物 3D 列印骨骼重建系統，透過兩段式溫控系統讓生物列印材料及生長因子兩者共存。這套「生物 3D 列印骨骼重建系統」，醫生可以在患者照完 X 光後同時開始進行列印，讓手術時間可以縮短一半以上，而最終輸出的成品更可以與患者斷裂的骨骼完美重合，更因為是利用患者的生物細胞進行列印減少排斥反應，可說是醫材 3D 列印上非常重要的突破，更樹立了良好的研究單位、學界、業界三方合作典範。
攜手國內企業，儀科中心要讓台灣做出屬於自己的先進儀器
從福衛五號的太空科技，到晶圓、半導體產業的生產儀器，儀科中心在台灣的科技發展中扮演非常關鍵的角色。
過往台灣半導體設備最大的出口國中國，近年因政策轉向國內自給，亦因外在的中美貿易戰影響，降低對國外進口設備的比例，對台灣半導體設備廠造成衝擊，但危機也是轉機，儀科中心此時的角色更為重要，透過串連國內廠商共同研發、製造新儀器，而後將完成的成果技轉至民間企業，可以有效提高台灣相關設備的自給率，打造設備自產的新生態系，讓台灣在世界的半導體優勢得以維持，甚至進一步擴大，在國際上持續佔有一席之地。

Promoting the opportunity for Taiwan's industrial equipment and equipment to be autonomous, the instrument center is the key card for the domestic semiconductor industry
04 Nov 2019, 05:02 by Guangbian Planning


What we want you to know is to promote the upgrading of the technology industry. The National Experimental Research Institute of the Foundation is committed to promoting the cultivation of domestic scientific and technological talents and innovating research and development, and leverages it. In recent years, in addition to actively cooperating with the academic community to provide solutions, it has also turned to the industry. The world hopes to serve as a platform between the research and industry and the industry, and to create an ecosystem of various fields of symbiosis and common prosperity. On October 7th, the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Center, the National High-speed Network and Computing Center, and the Taiwan Instrument Technology Research Center jointly exhibited the technological achievements in the field of wisdom, attracting the industry and the academic community to participate in the event, and hope to make this opportunity The prolific academic research community can understand the efforts of the National Research Institute in research and development platform services and witness the technological innovations led by the National Research Institute in recent years.



The International Semiconductor Industry Association SEMI predicts that the semiconductor industry in the next 3-5 years will have huge wafer demand and market opportunities, but the technology is very challenging. It will create high value-added innovation through heterogeneous integration of different technologies, different functions and different materials. End products. Taiwan's semiconductor market reached 2.62 trillion US dollars, ranking third in the world. This year, there is a chance to return to the second. How to achieve innovative R&D will be an important decision point for Taiwan to maintain its leading position.
TSMC has squeezed into the third-largest semiconductor manufacturer in the first half of 2019, relying on the leadership of the seven-nano process this year. However, Taiwan's breakthrough in semiconductor-related industries has yet to be resolved: equipment. The equipment field of semiconductor advanced process has long been monopolized by a few large manufacturers, such as etch leader ASML and physical vapor deposition (PVD) equipment leader AMAT, which accounted for 75.3% and 84.9% of the market share respectively, which represents Taiwan equipment. Even if the factory invests in a more advanced technology and a larger market share, it will also spread a large budget to foreign manufacturers, and it is difficult to achieve industrial growth in Taiwan. In 2017, Taiwan’s semiconductor equipment investment has exceeded 500 billion demand, but the domestic self-sufficiency rate is only 12%.
In this environment, the Instrument Center has become the most important core unit of Taiwan's equipment production. With Taiwan's only large-diameter optical lens development technology, it provides a complete optical system customized service platform, which can assist the science and technology research and industry. In the various fields of medical and agricultural development, we develop customized special optical components and instruments for forward-looking research. Therefore, the Instrument Center has the ability to develop and design the most advanced high-tech manufacturing equipment, including semiconductor exposure machines for advanced packaging processes, plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition systems, and atomic layer etching and other related equipment. R&D and manufacturing have become the best helper for domestic companies. Deputy Director of the Instrument Center Chen Fengzhi said, ""The most important business of the Instrument Center is to use the unique equipment and technology to assist manufacturers in developing the ""non-existent"" equipment on the market, designing according to the needs of customers and assisting them. Taiwanese factories reduce production costs and increase product yields, thereby boosting international competitiveness. ""

The ""Black Technology"" original created by the Instrument Center: domestic self-developed advanced process equipment
After the meeting, the Instrument Center also led participants to visit the achievements of domestic companies in the semiconductor, biomedical, aerospace and other industries in recent years, including the first self-developed Atomic Layer Etching (ALE) The equipment prototype was also exposed for the first time on the day! ALE equipment focuses on the development of GaN to develop next-generation semiconductor power components, as the best tool for making tiny structures ""precision etching"", which can be applied to special advanced process steps in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In the process of self-developed self-made equipment development, the use of domestic components is the mainstay, and the industry chain is deeply rooted. This ALE instrument has all the advantages of flexible adjustment of components, low maintenance costs and the development of upstream and downstream industries in China.
Chen Fengzhi said, ""The core technology of the Instrument Center is the integration of optics, vacuum and opto-mechanical systems. Industry partners and academic partners understand our core technologies and build instruments according to their needs."" For example, the largest wafer lithography equipment supplier in China and the world. Esmer's business case is a successful case of cooperation between the Instrument Center and the Taiwan Machinery Factory. The Instrument Center assisted the machinery factory in building advanced machinery through optical specialty and won the order of Esmore. ""I believe that if we can find cooperation with private manufacturers, these manufacturers will give priority to private manufacturers, but they will come to us because private manufacturers have no way to do such research and development, so they need to rely on the instrument center to help."" Even Taiwanese manufacturers actually I don't want to let the industry know that they are cooperating with the Instrument Center. ""They all think this is a KNOWHOW,"" said Deputy Director Chen.

At the same time, the Instrument Center has also achieved relevant results in the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) equipment, through the 12 吋矽 wafer plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) system technology researched by the Instrument Center. It can solve the problem of uneven thickness of large curvature samples by traditional physical vapor deposition (PVD). It is difficult for traditional PVD technology to complete uniform coverage on non-smooth surfaces. It can be completed by ALD new technology of Instrument Center. The optical film with a step coverage improves the uniformity of the coating of large-area and large-curvature samples in the past, thereby improving the imaging resolution. In 2015, the E-Commerce Center and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. jointly established the ""Atomic Layer Deposition Joint Laboratory"" to further provide a service platform for testing and development verification of ALD process equipment in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.

In response to the industry's limited equipment budget, the Instrument Center can also support various forward-looking research in various aspects, and upgrade equipment to meet the needs, create the energy and opportunity for Taiwan's industrial equipment and equipment to automate, and integrate the overall industrial chain to improve The overall vitality and kinetic energy of the domestic instrument and equipment industry.
More than semiconductors: The Instrument Center has teamed up with the medical and academic circles to develop advanced medical materials that can be printed on the bones.
In addition, the Instrument Center has also cut into medical equipment in recent years. After years of hard work, it has completed the ISO 13485 medical equipment quality system environment in line with the International Medical Materials Regulations. The Biocompatibility Verification Service Platform and the Electrical Safety Verification Laboratory have also been It is ISO 10993 certified and has created the first domestic environmental platform for surgical guidance availability. It is to see Taiwan's $1,206 million worth of medical materials market this year, and plans to help manufacturers cut into the international market through a complete platform. The resources and energy of Taiwan's production and academic circles shorten the time course for the prototype development of biotechnology medical products, and assist Taiwan's new ventures to create the goal of killer application of medical materials.

For example, the Bio 3D Printed Bone Reconstruction System, developed in collaboration with Taipei Medical University and Sanding Biotech, allows both bioprinting materials and growth factors to coexist through a two-stage temperature control system. This ""Bio 3D Printed Bone Reconstruction System"" allows doctors to start printing at the same time as the patient has finished X-rays, allowing the operation time to be cut by more than half, and the final output can be perfectly matched to the broken bones of the patient. It is also because the use of the patient's biological cells for printing to reduce rejection, can be said to be a very important breakthrough in the 3D printing of medical materials, but also established a good research unit, academic circles, industry tripartite cooperation model.
In cooperation with domestic enterprises, the Instrument Center must let Taiwan make its own advanced instruments.
From the space technology of Fuwei No. 5 to the production equipment of the wafer and semiconductor industries, the Instrument Center plays a very important role in the development of science and technology in Taiwan.
In the past, China, the largest exporter of semiconductor equipment in Taiwan, has turned to domestic self-sufficiency in recent years. It has also reduced the proportion of foreign imported equipment due to the influence of the external Sino-US trade war, which has caused an impact on Taiwan’s semiconductor equipment factory, but the crisis is also a turning point. The role of the Instrument Center at this time is even more important. By connecting domestic manufacturers to jointly develop and manufacture new instruments, and then transferring the finished results to private enterprises, it can effectively improve the self-sufficiency rate of Taiwan-related equipment and create new equipment for self-production. The ecosystem has enabled Taiwan's semiconductor advantages in the world to be maintained and even further expanded, and it continues to have a place in the international arena.
