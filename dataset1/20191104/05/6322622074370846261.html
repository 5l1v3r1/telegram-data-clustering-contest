      <p>BENGALURU (Nov 4): Most Southeast Asian markets rose on Monday, with Thailand leading gains, as progress in the long drawn Sino-US trade talks and strong jobs data from the United States buoyed risk appetite.</p>
      <p>Washington and Beijing said on Friday the two sides had made progress in resolving a near 16-month long trade dispute, soothing some worries over the economic fallout from their trade war.</p>
      <p>However, sentiment remained in check, given the tumultuous nature of previous attempts at reaching a deal.</p>
      <p>"While a deal may appear to be within sights, markets' provision for disappointment could still keep optimism leashed," Maybank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, data released on Friday showed the US job growth slowing less than expected in October, showing that the world's largest economy still had some resilience.</p>
      <p>Thai stocks gained as much as 1.2%, to mark their biggest intraday gain in over three weeks.</p>
      <p>Utilities and financials sectors were among the biggest gainers, with Gulf Energy Development PCL and Kasikornbank PCL rising 3.2% and 5.4%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Philippine bourse advanced 0.6% as financials and utilities firms gained.</p>
      <p>Bank of the Philippine Islands and Manila Electric Co were up as much as 1.8% and 2.9%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Singapore's Straits Times index gained up to 0.6% to a more-than three-month high, lifted by financials and consumer firms.</p>
      <p>DBS Group Holdings and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd gained up to 1.5% each.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, factory activity in China, the region's largest trading partner, expanded unexpectedly at the fastest pace in over two years in October, according to data released on Friday, easing concerns of a slowdown in demand from the world's second largest economy due to US tariffs.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian index edged up 0.3%, with Sime Darby Plantation and Maxis Bhd rising 1% and 1.3%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The country's September exports was worse than expected by falling 6.8% from a year ago, compared with a <i>Reuters </i>poll forecast of 0.1% decline.</p>
      <p>Indonesia's benchmark index edged lower, while Vietnam's benchmark index rose to its highest since October 2018.</p>
