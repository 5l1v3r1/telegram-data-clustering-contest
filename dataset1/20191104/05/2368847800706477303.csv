林鄭月娥連累全家 逾12萬人連署撤其英國籍

04 Nov 2019, 05:43

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】香港反送中運動已持續了五個月，港府仍未解決民眾訴求，甚至動用港警暴力鎮壓行為越發嚴重，外界呼籲英國應撤銷推動《逃犯條例》修訂草案的港府官員及其家人的英國國籍等。10月，有網友在Change.org請願網站發起連署，要求英國政府撤銷香港特首林鄭月娥一家人的英國國籍，截至目前該連署數已突破12萬人。
據《自由時報》11月2日報導，一位名為Deeran Kumar的香港網友四周前在Change.org上發起連署，他於連署書上表示，「在香港政府引用《緊急法》通過《禁蒙面法》，而法律卻不及於香港警察，可見政府機關在法律之前並不平等，這顯示香港已非法治社會，併進入緊急狀態，因此，我要求英國內政部撤銷林鄭月娥一家的英國公民身份」。
報導說，林鄭月娥曾是英國國籍，後來為了在香港任職，退出英國國籍，但她的丈夫Lam Siu-Por和兩個兒子Lam Jit-si和Lam Yeuk-hei，英文名字分別是Joshua和Jeremy，都是英國公民。此外，香港立法會主席梁君彥、保安局局長李家超等人雖然也退出英國國籍，但他們的家人都是英國籍。
在連署書的最後，Deeran Kumar強調，「我誠摯相信，英國對遏制香港的暴力行為須負道德責任，有鑒於林鄭月娥拒負香港特首責任並施行嚴刑峻法，英國內政部應該永久撤銷林鄭月娥一家的公民身份」。截至2日為止，「撤銷林鄭月娥全家英國國籍」的請願活動已有超過12萬人簽名連署。根據英國法律，英國政府必須對訴求做出回應，並於國會進行辯論。
據報，此前，10月16日，有推友發推披露，林鄭月娥當下所求非香港特首政績，實為北京功勞。因為她早在1998年就加入了中共。
據推特帳號「突發事件【Breaking News】」發推文說，已移民海外的前中共機密檔案管理人爆料稱，港、臺多名政要、名人為中共秘密黨員。
其中林鄭月娥，於1998年入黨，其仕途由中共扶持，基督信仰為掩蓋；建制派議員何君堯，於1974年入共青團，1984年入中共。
同一推特帳戶還曾於10月11日發帖披露林鄭的真實身份，實為中共絕密計劃—「紅燈計劃」的選定人。
帖文稱，港府有自稱「看不過眼」之人透露：林鄭基督徒身份為掩飾，實為中共黨員，黨齡超20年。林鄭當下所求非港特首政績，實為北京功勞。
中共紅燈計劃（Redlight Plan），取意交通信號紅燈停語義，始於上世紀80年代。隨英中談判展開，由政法委、組織部等實施，垂直聽命政治局常委，首任決策者陳雲，也是該計劃發起人。推行該計劃目的是彌補中共以往海外發展組織注重底層、缺乏高層力量，彌補不能施展直接力量。機密等級：絕對機密。
該計劃強調長期性，強調絕對控制——輔助選中者成長，掌握其黑資料，控制家屬等。
匿名爆料人還透露，其自身同為紅燈計劃選定人。選定人之間與上級單線聯繫，不知彼此身份。獲知林鄭身份繫上級點明並要求全力配合林鄭，據此推測林鄭當知港府所有選定人。
臉書帳戶「歷史時空」也曾發表多張林鄭早年時的照片，一張顯示林鄭於1979年到訪清華大學，與中共領導合影。還有一張顯示，林鄭1979年曾擔任香港大學學生會清華大學交流團副團長。
與林鄭合影的男姓被指是曾任清華大學黨務書記的袁永熙，袁當時是以社科院領導身份接待香港來的林鄭；還有推友上傳林鄭擔任交流團副團長的更全面截圖。
2016年5月，林鄭月娥接受商台訪問時曾自曝，80年代加入政府前，經常站在前線參與社運，又曾擔任副團長，組織首個到清華大學的交流團。
已經停刊的《開放雜誌》早在2017年2月就曾發表題為《北京為何強勢推銷林鄭？》一文揭露，林鄭是中共地下黨。
文章說，身兼港澳工作協調小組組長的人大委員長張德江，親自南下深圳召見一班親共人士，宣稱「林鄭月娥是中央唯一支持的特首參選人」「支持林鄭月娥是中央政治局的一致決定」。
其中「政治局」一說是明顯的破綻，除了盲從的利益持份者，沒有多少人相信。
究竟為什麼張德江迫不及待赤䏝上陣，更把政治局擺上臺，強勢推銷林鄭？
文章分析，應該是張德江向習近平匯報了過去5年中共黨員當特首對其黨在各方面的好處。
而造成香港動盪不安，經濟疲弱，皆因梁振英管治不力所致，只要換上林鄭當特首，她在梁振英幕後控制下，變相的黨員當特首政策仍可延續，讓習相信他們的獻策。
文章說，林鄭就是梁振英自己選定的接班人，以延續變相地下黨員當特首路線。而林鄭說「情勢變化太大，我要重新考慮自己的情況」時就露了底，她無法解釋梁振英棄連任與她有何關係。
文章表示，一旦林鄭當選，香港將再次墮入「兩制漸趨一國化，意識形態大陸化，西環治港常規化，治港班子左派化」的陷阱之中，而對不起我們的下一代。
同年3月26日，港首選舉小圈子被中共江系綁架，選票必須填寫「林鄭月娥」。當天1194名選委參加投票，417人頂住壓力不屈從，林鄭得了777張票當選。

Lin Zhengyue smashed the family, and more than 120,000 people withdrew their British nationality.

04 Nov 2019, 05:43

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign has been going on for five months. The Hong Kong Government has still not resolved the people's demands, and even the use of the violent repression of the Hong Kong police has become more serious. The outside world has called for the British to revoke the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance. ""The revised draft of the Hong Kong government officials and their families' British nationality. In October, some netizens launched a registration on the Change.org petition website, requesting the British government to revoke the British nationality of the Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue's family. As of now, the number of the company has exceeded 120,000.
According to a report by the Free Times on November 2nd, a Hong Kong netizen named Deeran Kumar launched a connection on Change.org four weeks ago. He said in a book that ""the Hong Kong government cited the ""Emergency Law"" to pass the ""Forbidden Month"" The Facial Law, but the law is not as good as the Hong Kong Police. It can be seen that the government agencies are not equal before the law. This shows that Hong Kong is no longer a rule of law society and has entered a state of emergency. Therefore, I ask the British Home Office to revoke the British citizenship of Lin Zhengyue’s family. "".""
The report said that Lin Zhengyue was a British national. Later, in order to serve in Hong Kong, he withdrew from British nationality, but her husband, Lam Siu-Por, and two sons, Lam Jit-si and Lam Yeuk-hei, were named Joshua and Jeremy. All are British citizens. In addition, the Chairman of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Leung Kwan-yan, the Secretary for Security, Li Ka-chao and others have also withdrawn from British nationality, but their families are British.
At the end of the book, Deeran Kumar stressed, ""I sincerely believe that the United Kingdom must bear moral responsibility for the violence against Hong Kong. In view of the fact that Lin Zhengyue refused the responsibility of the Hong Kong Chief Executive and imposed severe punishment, the Home Office of the United Kingdom should permanently revoke Lin Zhengyue. The citizenship of a family."" As of the 2nd, more than 120,000 people signed up for the ""Revocation of Lin Zhengyue's British Nationality"" petition. Under British law, the British government must respond to claims and debate in Congress.
It has been reported that on October 16th, there were pushes and friends to disclose the disclosure. Lin Zhengyue’s current request for non-Hong Kong chief executives was actually credited by Beijing. Because she joined the CCP as early as 1998.
According to the Twitter account ""Breaking News"", the former CCP secret file administrator who has immigrated overseas broke the news that many political figures and celebrities from Hong Kong and Taiwan are secret members of the CCP.
Among them, Lin Zhengyue, who joined the party in 1998, was supported by the CCP and covered by the Christian faith. He Junyi, a member of the founding party, joined the Communist Youth League in 1974 and joined the CCP in 1984.
The same Twitter account was also posted on October 11 to disclose Lin Zheng’s true identity. It is actually the chosen person of the CCP’s top secret plan, the “Red Light Project”.
According to the post, the people in the Hong Kong government who claimed to be ""looking at the eye"" revealed that Lin Zheng’s Christian identity was a cover-up. He was a member of the Communist Party of China and the party was over 20 years old. Lin Zheng’s current request for non-Hong Kong chief executives is indeed a credit for Beijing.
The Redlight Plan of the CCP, in search of the red light of the traffic signal, began in the 1980s. With the implementation of the British-Chinese negotiations, the Politics and Law Committee, the Organization Department and other implementations, vertically obeying the Politburo Standing Committee, the first decision-maker Chen Yun, is also the initiator of the plan. The purpose of the plan is to make up for the CCP's past overseas development organizations to focus on the bottom, lack of high-level strength, and make up for the inability to exert direct force. Confidential level: Absolutely confidential.
The program emphasizes long-term nature and emphasizes absolute control—helping the winners grow, mastering their black data, and controlling family members.
Anonymous sources also revealed that they themselves are selected by the red light plan. The selected people are in contact with the superior single line, and they do not know each other's identity. I was informed that Lin Zheng’s identity was superior and asked for full cooperation with Lin Zheng. According to this, Lin Zheng was informed that all the selected people of the Hong Kong Government.
The Facebook account ""Historical Time and Space"" has also published many photos of Lin Zheng's early years. One shows that Lin Zheng visited Tsinghua University in 1979 and took photos with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Another show shows that Lin Zheng served as the deputy head of the exchange group of Tsinghua University of the Hong Kong University Student Union in 1979.
The male surname with Lin Zheng was accused of being Yuan Yongxi, who was once the party secretary of Tsinghua University. Yuan was the Lin Zheng who received Hong Kong from the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; and the friend who uploaded Lin Zheng as the deputy head of the exchange group. A full screenshot.
In May 2016, Lin Zhengyue was exposed when he was interviewed by the commercial platform. Before joining the government in the 1980s, he often stood on the front line and participated in the social movement. He also served as the deputy head of the delegation and organized the first exchange group to Tsinghua University.
The Open Magazine, which has been discontinued, published a question entitled ""Why is Beijing strongly marketing Lin Zheng as early as February 2017?"" ""The article reveals that Lin Zheng is the underground party of the Communist Party of China.
The article said that Zhang Dejiang, chairman of the People's Congress, who is also the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Coordination Group, personally summoned a group of relatives in Shenzhen, claiming that ""Lin Zhengyue is the only chief executive candidate supported by the Central Committee."" ""Supporting Lin Zhengyue is the consensus of the Central Political Bureau. Decide.""
Among them, the ""Political Bureau"" said that it is an obvious flaw. In addition to the blind stakeholders, there are not many people who believe it.
Why is Zhang Dejiang unable to wait for Akasaka to go into battle, and put the Politburo on the stage to promote Lin Zheng?
The article analyzes that Zhang Dejiang should report to Xi Jinping the benefits of the party’s chief executive in the past five years.
The turmoil in Hong Kong and the weak economy are all caused by the ineffective management of Liang Zhenying. As long as she is replaced by Lin Zhengying, she is under the control of Liang Zhenying. The disguised party members can continue the policy of the chief executive, and let Xi believe their suggestions.
The article said that Lin Zheng is the successor chosen by Liang Zhenying himself to continue the disguised underground party members as the special leader. Lin Zheng said that ""the situation changed too much, I have to reconsider my own situation"" and she revealed that she could not explain how Liang Zhenying abandoned her re-election.
The article said that once Lin Zheng was elected, Hong Kong will once again break into the trap of ""two systems gradually becoming nationalized, ideology is continentalized, the West is governed by Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong team is left."" generation.
On March 26 of the same year, the Hong Kong First Election Circle was kidnapped by the Chinese Communist Party. The ballot must be filled in ""Lin Zhengyue"". On the same day, 1,194 electoral committees voted, and 417 people withstood the pressure and did not yield. Lin Zheng was elected 777 votes.
