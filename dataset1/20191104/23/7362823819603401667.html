      <h1>Voters will want to rule on Trump at ballot box, not via impeachment, Brit Hume says</h1>

      <p>As the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential election</a> approaches, voters may be less and less willing to go through <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">Trump impeachment proceedings</a> because they will soon have the final say themselves, according to Brit Hume.</p>
      <p>Some voters may consider whether Democrats are trying to politically hurt <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> as the impeachment process drags on, Hume asserted Monday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Special Report</a>."</p>
      <p>"The closer we get to the election, the more people are going to say, 'Wait a minute, he's only got a few months before we the voters get a chance to decide whether he ought to remain in office,'" he said.</p>

      <p>"So, why not wait, and then the argument will be made that, 'Look, they're just trying to damage him and touch him up politically so he can't be reelected' -- that could leave a bad taste."</p>
      <p>The Fox News political analyst said that the more voters believe Democrats are trying to damage the president, the easier Republicans will find it to help constituents grasp a decision not to convict him in the Senate.</p>
      <p>He did say Trump is not helping himself by characterizing his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "perfect."</p>

      <p>The president is under an impeachment investigation over allegedly withholding millions in defense funding from Ukraine in order for Kiev to investigate the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-responds-to-bidens-60-minutes-interview-takes-swipe-at-hunter">Bidens’ business relationships in the country.</a></p>
