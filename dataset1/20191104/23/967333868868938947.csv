Watch: Evo Morales Safe After Helicopter Makes Emergency Landing
A helicopter carrying Bolivian President Evo Morales was forced to make an emergency landing Monday afternoon due to a mechanical error.

04 Nov 2019, 23:07

An issue with the helicopter's tail rotor caused the aircraft to act erratically and prompted the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Bolivian town of Colquiri at around 12:48 p.m. local time, according to a statement from Bolivia's Air Force.






The Air Force confirmed soon after that no one was injured, and the exact cause of the rotor issue is under investigation. 



Witnesses told the Agencia de Noticias Fides that the helicopter fell to the ground from approximately ""15 meters high"" during the landing.  
Morales, the 80th president of Bolivia, has served as the country's leader since 2006 and recently won reelection with 47.08% of the vote. 
While Bolivian law does not require a runoff, as the head of the Movement to Socialism beat his main opponent Carlos Mesa by more than a 10% difference, the opposition leader did not immediately accept the results. 
Morales has fired back at assertions that his win was unjust and denounced related claims as an attempt to carry out a coup. 
""A warning ... to all the people of Bolivia and the various social sectors that are preparing to carry out a coup d'etat this week: we have already been informed,"" he said. 
The Organization of American States has since began auditing the election's results.
