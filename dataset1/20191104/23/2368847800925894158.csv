猝死重慶副書記傳與陳敏爾不睦 學者:疑反習勢力被整肅

04 Nov 2019, 23:12

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】重慶市委副書記任學鋒在四中全會閉幕日突然死亡。中共官方在其已去世3天後，才在深夜對外發布消息，稱其近日因病醫治無效死亡，引發外界質疑。有消息指任某系跳樓身亡，而多個信息源指其或因捲入體制內的路線鬥爭而被清除。
重慶官媒華龍網11月3日深夜11時許發布消息稱，中共重慶市委副書記任學鋒「近日因病醫治無效，不幸離世」。作為官方媒體，發布一名直轄市委副書記的去世信息，竟然使用的是「近日」這種含糊其辭的詞語，而且這則消息也未說明任某生前所患何病，令外界頓生疑竇。
與此同時，海外被視為有中共江派背景的華文媒體爆料稱，有來自重慶方面的消息，指任學鋒「曾經墮樓」並送醫院搶救；大陸網絡社群中也傳出了任學鋒跳樓自殺身亡的傳聞。
網上還傳出一份僅有76字的簡短官方訃告，顯示任學鋒的死亡時間為10月31日。也就是說，任學鋒是在中共四中全會結束當天即已死亡，而中共官方是在他死亡整整3天後才發布了有關消息。

據公開的訊息，任學鋒最後一次出現在公眾視線是在今年的10月26日，在重慶出席由重慶市委理論學習中心組舉行的專題學習會，然後銷聲匿跡，直至官方日前發出死訊。
外界分析，根據中共省部級高官的治喪慣例，如果該級別官員只是因病死亡，死訊很快就會發布。而任學鋒身為中央候補委員，參加四中全會期間在京西賓館突然死亡，其告別儀式沒有安排在臨近的八寶山，而是捨近求遠降格到昌平去找一個僅能容納200人以下的告別廳舉行，亦讓各界感到蹊蹺。
自由亞洲電台引述熟悉重慶官場的趙先生透露，年僅54歲的任學鋒原本是作為重要後備人才重用的，也是被當作繼黃奇帆之後，又一個懂經濟的技術型官僚。一度傳出要成重慶的接班人。其突然死亡，只能說高層權力之間又出了大事。
趙先生說，有兩個朋友正式告訴他，任學鋒是在京西墜樓死亡的。因為他知道在這種時候選擇自殺的話，就把自己解脫掉了。
學者吳祚來也說，任學鋒是個「很能幹的傢伙」，是有可能取代劉鶴的人，但這次「在那個賓館直接跳下去」，這不是路線鬥爭是甚麼？他坦言，「任學鋒的自殺，背後應該是體制內反對習近平的派系遭整肅的直接體現。」
重慶居民趙女士4日對自由亞洲電台說，坊間對市委副書記任學鋒之死因，亦存在不同於官方的版本，包括任學鋒與重慶市委書記陳敏爾之間存在某種分歧。她說：「重慶坊間對這條新聞是有一些流傳。任學鋒自去年年底到任重慶，出任市委副書記以來，大家對他的印象並不怎麼深，他行事為人也比較低調。但他出事（死亡）以後，坊間有些傳聞說他跟市委書記陳敏爾並不是特別的合拍，甚至有一些爭吵，有一些不睦。」
中國異議學者司令也告訴自由亞洲電台，任學鋒雖然曾經在天津市、廣東省及重慶擔任高官，但是不屬當權派人馬,他認為在肅清薄熙來餘毒等工作上，「可能任學鋒與陳敏爾有不同意見，這引起了陳敏爾和習近平極大的警戒。所以有傳言認為，這是他殺或自殺或因病，總之此事來得有很多蹊蹺之處。」
公開資料顯示，任學鋒是河北邢台人，長期在天津任職，2004年至2008年曾任天津市政府駐「香港津聯集團有限公司」董事長，後擔任天津市副市長。2014年，任學鋒接替落馬的萬慶良，出任中共廣州市委書記。三年後，列入中共十八屆、十九屆中央候補委員。2018年10月，任學鋒調任重慶市委副書記。
重慶市的高層官員近年頻繁出現人事變動或被迫下台。迄今為止，已先後有薄熙來、孫政才兩任市委書記入獄，專職副書記任學鋒橫死，更有王立軍、何挺兩任公安局長落馬，一位前公安局副局長被槍斃。
