【單親爸爸週記】溝通無效

04 Nov 2019, 23:58

講工作電話講到很煩，兒子在旁要人陪。
電話裡有一個煩惱，眼前還有一個正在形成─
「爸爸陪我。」
「爸爸你好久。」
接著便是一陣哭聲。
邊講電話，邊糾結自己是不是太少陪他，陪他時會不會太敷衍─
因為除了我之外，就沒人可以陪伴他了。
隔著一扇落地窗，兩個人都為彼此煩惱著。



「你看這個哥哥穿這個很帥，穿一下嘛。」
「不要，我不要穿。」
興沖沖幫他買新衣服，他卻嫌棄不想穿。
打電話給他阿嬤求救，我媽卻雲淡風輕得很，用有點看好戲的口吻說：
「啊你小時候還不是這樣。」
於是，那件吊帶褲還以嶄新的樣子，掛著吊牌中。

[Single parent daddy] communication is invalid

04 Nov 2019, 23:58

Talking about the work phone is very annoying, and the son is accompanying someone.
There was an annoyance on the phone, and another one was forming in front of him-
""Dad is with me.""
""Dad, how long have you been.""
Then there was a cry.
While talking on the phone, wondering if he is too little to accompany him, will he be too perfunctory when he is with him-
Because no one but me can accompany him.
Two people were troubled by each other across a floor-to-ceiling window.



""You see this brother wearing this handsome, wear it.""
""No, I don't want to wear it.""
Xing rushed to help him buy new clothes, but he did not want to wear it.
Calling his aunt for help, my mother is very light and light, with a little optimistic voice saying:
""Ah, when you were a child, it was not like this.""
So, the suspenders were still in a brand new look and hung in the tag.
