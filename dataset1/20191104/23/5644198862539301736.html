      <p>BANGKOK: The <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/rcep-negotiations-signing-expected-2020-12062560">conclusion of text-based negotiations</a> among 15 out of 16 nations marks a "very major step forward" for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday (Nov 4) evening. </p>
      <p>Speaking at the end of the 35th ASEAN Summit, Mr Lee said that with 15 economies on board, the agreement was a substantial one. </p>

      <p>He also said he understood India's decision to "not yet" join in.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pity that India is not yet on board, we hope one day it will come on board. But nevertheless, this is a very major step forward for the RCEP - tremendous progress for which we have to thank the negotiators from all of the countries,” said Mr Lee.</p>

      <p>“We understand India’s position. India has made its position clear, (Prime Minister) Modi expressed it in forthright terms.</p>
      <p>“And there’s no anxiety or rancour … We fully understand and appreciate India’s point of view. They have made that decision. We respect that decision," he added.</p>
      <p>“We hope one day that it will be possible, either because we can overcome the specific issues that are outstanding or India takes a different perspective, (for us to) come together and India will be part of the group," Mr Lee said. </p>
      <p>"If possible, it happens by next year then everybody can sign," he added. </p>
      <p>Issues on market access as well as some “technicalities” had meant that India did not agree to the deal, said Mr Lee. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>The 16-nation RCEP would have accounted for a third of global gross domestic product and nearly half the world's population.</p>
      <p>RCEP includes the 10-member grouping of Southeast Asian nations, as well as China, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>New impetus to complete what could be the world's largest trade deal has come from the US-China trade war, which has helped knock regional economic growth to its lowest in five years.</p>
      <p>In the event that India eventually refuses to come on board, each of the other countries will have to assess “feasible possibilities”, said Mr Lee.</p>
      <p>Even in that situation, "RCEP X (number of countries) is better than RCEP 0," he added. </p>
