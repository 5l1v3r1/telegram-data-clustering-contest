      <h1>2 gang-related murder suspects escaped from California jail through small hole in ceiling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T23:31:05+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 23:31</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>Authorities said two gang-related <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">murder suspects,</a> considered dangerous, escaped early Sunday from a central <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> jail through a hole less than two feet wide, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Monterey County Sheriff’s Office said the inmates managed to take advantage of a blind spot in the housing unit surveillance, as <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/2-murder-suspects-escape-from-central-california-jail-through-hole-in-bathroom-ceiling">Fox 2</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles south of San Francisco, is surrounded by barbed wire; authorities told the news outlet that the inmates escaped through a hatch in an construction area where there isn’t any barbed wire.</p>
      <p>Santos Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, had been jailed since 2018, and were awaiting trial on unrelated murder counts “along with numerous other felony charges,” a sheriff’s statement said.</p>
      <p>Fonseca was being held on two counts of murder and attempted robbery on a $2.25 million bail, <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/two-inmates-facing-murder-charges-escape-from-monterey-county-jail">Fox 2</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Fonseca is accused of shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, <a href="https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/2019/11/03/monterey-county-jail-escape-salinas-california/4151175002/">the Californian newspaper in Salinas reported</a>. Fonseca told police that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove his loyalty to the “Boronda gang,” Detective Gabriela Contreras testified. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.</p>
      <p>Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that his gang leader also ordered the murder, and that he picked his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend “to send him a message,” Contreras said, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez; police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related.</p>
      <p>Officers said at Salazar’s preliminary hearing earlier this year that his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported.</p>
