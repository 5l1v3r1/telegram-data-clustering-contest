      <p>"Tonight before dinner I filled an empty Heinz bottle with Aldi sauce,'  Michele said.</p>
      <p>"The husband and son both used it and as they take on EVERYTHING, near enough,' Michele wrote in a post which gathered more than 500 likes.</p>
      <p>"Not one has mentioned it tasting different, and although I don't take it unless on sausages, neither can I.</p>
      <p>"Win win for me, I think."</p>

      <p>According to the Daily Mail, one user replied they did not stop at just sauces but had extended to other household items, writing: "I do it with everything, cereals, sauces, shampoo, shower gels.</p>
      <p>Another added: "I've done this for years. No comments ever."</p>
      <p>Heinz ketchup created in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1869 and is the best selling brand of ketchup.</p>
