      <h2>All-electric crossover to kickstart the German brand's EV offensive in China, with 10 new electric models to be launched in China by 2023.</h2>

      <p><b>Volkswagen</b> has detailed its upcoming product offensive for the Chinese market, in the process teasing the new <b>ID.4 electric crossover</b> which is due to be revealed in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Despite the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-id-3/">ID.3 hatchback</a> having already gone on sale in Europe, the Tiguan-sized <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-id-4/">ID.4</a> will be the first of Volkswagen's new EV models to hit the Chinese market when production starts in 12 months time – similar to how it will kickstart the brand's electrification push in Australia, too.</p>
      <p>The ID.4 will be the first of 10 new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/meb/">MEB</a>-based electric vehicles to launch in China by 2023, along with a range of new plug-in hybrid models and cars with "high-efficiency combustion engines".</p>
      <p>Volkswagen has confirmed a version of the ID.3 will be sold in China following the launch of the ID.4, to be produced at a new plant in Anting by the SAIC Volkswagen joint venture.</p>

      <p>Beyond the upcoming range of electrified models, the German brand has committed to a slew of new "high-efficiency" combustion-powered models.</p>
      <p>One of these will be a market-specific version of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-t-cross/">T-Cross</a>, dubbed the Tacqua (above), which will be produced by FAW Volkswagen, while the new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-viloran/">Viloran</a> people mover will be built by SAIC Volkswagen.</p>
      <p>Since 2018 Volkswagen has commenced the rollout of 14 new models in China, including five new SUVs.</p>
      <p>"We have given our brand a new look, a new character, a new corporate goal focusing fully on decarbonisation and new cars," said Stephan Wöllenstein, CEO for Volkswagen Group China.</p>
      <p>"The ID.Next and ID.3 show that we are on the way to mobility with a neutral carbon balance with battery electric vehicles."</p>

      <h3>Australia</h3>
      <p>Like China, Volkswagen's Australian electrification rollout <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/794717/volkswagen-first-electric-suv-to-land-in-australia-below-50000/">will kick off with the ID.4</a> – though the first examples aren't expected to touch down in 2022.</p>
      <p>Speaking with media at the recent <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/category/frankfurt-motor-show/">Frankfurt motor show</a>, Volkswagen's local product planning boss, Jeff Shafer, said the Australian division is aiming to have the ID.4 kick off at below $50,000, which would put it well below the current price point of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/hyundai-kona-electric/">Hyundai Kona Electric</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tesla/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a>.</p>
      <p>"I'm an optimist," he said, "I would like to see something under $50,000. If we could bring in that ID SUV [the ID.4] in that space, I think it'd be very successful in a lot of ways."</p>
      <p>"As Michael [Bartsch, VW Australia managing director] said, it's a long journey compared to where we are at today," Shafer continued, "I had that meeting again today. And without saying anything I shouldn't, we have a couple of meetings coming up in November, where we are going to be having this discussion again."</p>
