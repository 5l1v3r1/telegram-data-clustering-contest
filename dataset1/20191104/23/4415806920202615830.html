      <p>Running – no matter how fast, far or often – is linked to a significantly lower risk of earlier death, according to new research.</p>
      <p>Researchers from Australia, Thailand and Finland believe “substantial” health benefits could be seen at population level if more people laced up their trainers, even just for a short jog.</p>
      <p>They analysed results from 14 studies of 233,149 people, whose health was tracked for between 5.5 and 35 years.</p>
      <p>During this time, 25,951 participants died.</p>
      <p>When the study data was pooled, any amount of running was associated with a 27% lower risk of death from all causers over the period of study for both sexes, compared to non-runners.</p>
      <blockquote>Any amount of running, even just once a week, is better than no running, but higher doses of running may not necessarily be associated with greater mortality benefits</blockquote>
      <p>And it was linked to a 30% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease, as well as a 23% lower risk of death from cancer.</p>
      <p>The researchers concluded: “Increased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity.</p>
      <p>“Any amount of running, even just once a week, is better than no running, but higher doses of running may not necessarily be associated with greater mortality benefits.”</p>
      <p>Even running just once a week or less frequently, for less than 50 minutes each time, and at a pace lower than six miles (eight km) an hour was linked to significant health benefits.</p>
      <p>Upping the running “dose” was not associated with a further lowering of the risk of death from any cause, the analysis showed.</p>
      <p>The experts said that, while vigorous exertion has been linked to sudden cardiac death, the mortality benefit of running outweighs the risk.</p>
      <p>Doctors should decide on a case-by-case basis whether to prescribe the activity, as it may not be suitable for all populations and is linked to a higher injury risk, they added.</p>
      <p>The authors cautioned that the study cannot establish cause and that the number of studies was small, with methods varying considerably.</p>
      <p>Future research should utilise the data held by activity trackers to assess running habits and the benefits, the said.</p>
      <p>The paper is published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p>
