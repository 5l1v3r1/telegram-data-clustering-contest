      <p><a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/ufc-244-masvidal-vs-diaz">At this weekend’s UFC 244</a>, held at New York’s Madison Square Garden, Jorge Masvidal defeated Nata Diaz <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/3/20946661/dana-white-nate-diaz-cuts-much-worse-then-they-looked-on-tv-jorge-masvidal-ufc-244-mma-news">via doctor stoppage</a> to claim the promotion’s novelty Baddest Motherf***er (BMF) title. U.S. President Donald Trump, who is friends with UFC President Dana White, attended the event, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/2/20945869/video-donald-trump-attends-ufc-244-gets-booed-by-new-york-crowd">where he received a mixed reaction</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">According to the <i>Washington Post</i></a> Trump’s appearance at the event cost around $60,000. Footing the bill for the appearance was the Republican National Committee (RNC). That amount includes tickets, catering and security for Trump and his guests.</p>
      <p>Trump’s guests included his two adult sons Donald Jr. and Eric, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and congressmen Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Peter T. King (R-NY). McCarthy, Meadows, and King are Trump loyalists. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/house/">According to <i>FiveThirtyEight</i></a> McCarthy has voted in line with Trump’s legislative agenda 98% of the time. Meadows has voted with Trump 90.4% of the time and King has voted with Trump 84.2% of the time.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Post </i>reported that it was ‘unclear’ how McCarthy, Meadows, and King could have accepted tickets for UFC 244, however. The <i>Post</i> stated that Members of the House of Representatives are allowed to accept free tickets to sporting events if the event is also a fundraising event. To receive gifts, members must have written approval.</p>
      <p>When the <i>Post </i>reached out to the RNC for comment on the matter an official told them that the RNC covered the cost of the event because Trump was attending.</p>
      <p>Spokespeople for King, Meadows and McCarthy – who posted<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4YoHuTl_Xw/"> a picture on Instagram</a> of him and Trump riding in Marine One over New York City – did not respond to requests from the <i>Post </i>for comments on the matter.</p>
      <p>A week before UFC 244 the RNC also paid $465 per seat in a luxury suite at Nationals Park so that Trump, along with 11 members of Congress and senior White House staffers, could attend a World Series game between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros.</p>
      <p>The RNC also paid for Trump to attend the college football national championship in 2018.</p>
      <p>The RNC is funded by political donations. Ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election the Fertitta brothers (then owners of the UFC), along with their wives, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/5/11/15052386/politicians-received-ufc-money-zuffa-politics-donations-dana-white-fertitta-donald-trump-mma-news">donated a combined $400,800 to the RNC. </a>In 2017 Dana White donated $29,600 to the RNC.</p>
