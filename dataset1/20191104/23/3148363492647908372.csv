Trump says companies are not leaving Kentucky after he became president. “They’re all coming back,” he says.

Trump says Beshear “doesn’t represent you… He represent the radical swamp.” He says Beshear wants sanctuary cities and is “too dangerous” and “too liberal” for Kentucky.
7:39 PM: Trump says Bevin is a “pain in the ass” because he is always asking Trump to help Kentucky (aid, manufacturing plants, etc.) and says that’s what a governor should do.



7:31 PM: Trump warns the country will have a “depression the likes of which the country has never seen before” if Democrats take over and now says Democrats are trying to nullify the votes of tens of millions of Americans with their impeachment inquiry. Trump says Democrats “declared war on American democracy” and Republicans have never been more united.
“The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander,” he says. Trump says the Dems’ outrageous conduct has created an “angry majority” that will vote the do-nothing Dems out of office. Crowd chants “Four More Years!”
