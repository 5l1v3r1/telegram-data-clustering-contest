      <h1>Man Utd and Tottenham 'hold transfer talks' with Andre Onana's agent</h1>
      <h2>The Ajax goalkeeper impressed during the club's Champions League run last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T23:57:30+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United and Tottenham have expressed interest in signing Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana and have made contact with the player's agent, according to reports in Holland.</p>
      <p>Onana has established himself as one of Europe's top goalkeepers after impressing for the Dutch giants last season.</p>
      <p>In addition to helping Ajax to a domestic double, the 23-year-old played a key role in the club's sensational Champions League run, which saw Erik ten Hag's side beat the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> on their route to the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>His performances last season and a strong start to the new campaign haven't gone unnoticed, with the Cameroon international reportedly attracting interest from United, Spurs an Paris-Saint Germain.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/sport/1591143066/spurs-man-united-en-psg-concreet-voor-onana">De Telegraaf</a> , all three clubs are keeping an eye on Onana and have held talks with his agent Albert Botines over a potential deal.</p>
      <p>The Dutch publication reports that Ajax would want a fee of between £34.5million and 43m for the goalkeeper, who was part of Barcelona's famous academy before making the move to the Eredivisie side in 2015.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Onana was a target for both his former club and PSG over the summer, shortly after extending his contract at the Johan Cruyff Arena until June 2022.</p>
      <p>“It was a difficult decision.  But I’m a young keeper, and I need to play," he said after <a href="https://english.ajax.nl/streams/ajax-now/yes-onana-extends-until-mid-2022-.htm">penning his new deal in March</a> .</p>

      <p>"I’m assured of this at Ajax, and it would be a question mark at some of the other top clubs abroad. </p>
      <p>"Moreover, Ajax had done a lot for me.  It’s important for me to give something back to the club."</p>
      <p>Although Spurs could be in the market for a new number one after Hugo Lloris' poor early-season and his long-term injury, an approach from United would raise eyebrows after the Red Devils tied David De Gea down to a long-term contract in September.</p>
      <p>Onana will be back in Champions League action on Tuesday night, when Ajax travel to Stamford Bridge to face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
