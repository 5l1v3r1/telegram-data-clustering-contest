A mum has revealed how she saved money by switching Heinz Tomato Ketchup for a cheaper Aldi version to save cash — and her family didn't know the difference.
Michele Black previously bought bottles of the 650g bottles of the Heinz favourite priced at £2.
To cut down on her household bills she has been topping up empty Heinz bottle with Aldi's Bramwells ketchup which costs only 45p for 560g and served it up at a Sunday family dinner.
Michelle shared her money saving trick on the Aldi Shoppers UK Facebook group where people said they had adopted similar methods to save cash.


The Aldi Bramwells ketchup costs 45p, in comparison to the £2 Heinz alternative



Her husband and son failed to notice that the sauce had changed

 
""Tonight before dinner I filled an empty Heinz bottle with Aldi sauce,'  Michele said.
""The husband and son both used it and as they take on EVERYTHING, near enough,' Michele wrote in a post which gathered more than 500 likes.
""Not one has mentioned it tasting different, and although I don't take it unless on sausages, neither can I.
""Win win for me, I think.""


Michele shared the money-saving tip on social media



Other savers said they used the trick for other products too

According to the Daily Mail, one user replied they did not stop at just sauces but had extended to other household items, writing: ""I do it with everything, cereals, sauces, shampoo, shower gels.
Another added: ""I've done this for years. No comments ever.""
Heinz ketchup created in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1869 and is the best selling brand of ketchup.
