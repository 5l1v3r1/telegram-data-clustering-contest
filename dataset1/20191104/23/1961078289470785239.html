      <h1>Lev Parnas, Giuliani Associate, Opens Talks With Impeachment Investigators</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T23:39:46+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 23:39</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Protess, Michael Rothfeld and William K. Rashbaum</a></address>
      <p>An associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani who was involved in a campaign to pressure Ukraine into aiding President Trump’s political prospects has broken ranks, opening a dialogue with congressional impeachment investigators and accusing the president of falsely denying their relationship.</p>
      <p>The associate, Lev Parnas, had previously resisted speaking with investigators for the Democrat-led impeachment proceedings, which are examining the president’s pressure attempts in Ukraine. A former lawyer for Mr. Trump was then representing Mr. Parnas.</p>
      <p>But since then, Mr. Parnas has hired new lawyers who contacted the congressional investigators last week to notify them to “direct any future correspondence or communication to us,” according to a copy of the letter.</p>
      <p>The lawyers also signaled on Monday that Mr. Parnas, who was arrested last month on campaign finance charges, is prepared to comply with a congressional subpoena for his documents and testimony.</p>
      <p>Mr. Parnas, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/lev-parnas-igor-fruman-arrested-giuliani.html?module=inline">a Ukrainian-born American citizen who was central to Mr. Giuliani’s efforts to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump’s rivals,</a> could offer Congress a vein of information about the efforts in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“We are willing to comply with the subpoena to the extent that it does not violate any appropriate privilege that Mr. Parnas may properly invoke,” said Joseph A. Bondy, who along with Edward B. MacMahon, Jr. now represents Mr. Parnas.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bondy said that given the federal criminal charges, his client may invoke his right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate himself.</p>
      <p>The turnabout occurred after Mr. Trump denied knowing Mr. Parnas when he was arrested.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Parnas was very upset by President Trump’s plainly false statement that he did not know him,” said Mr. Bondy, whose client has maintained that he has had extensive dealings with the president.</p>
      <p>After federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced charges against Mr. Parnas and three other men, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-69/">Mr. Trump</a> told reporters that he did not know Mr. Parnas or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/ukraine-cast-of-characters.html?module=inline">Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate</a> who also worked to help Mr. Trump in Ukraine and was among those charged with campaign finance violations. The two men had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/nyregion/trump-giuliani-lev-parnas-igor-fruman.html?module=inline">contributed extensively to political committees supporting Mr. Trump and appeared with the president</a> in pictures posted on social media.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know them. I don’t know about them. I don’t know what they do … Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You’d have to ask Rudy,” the president said. Of the numerous photographs of them together, Mr. Trump said, “I have a picture with everybody.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Parnas initially remained in Mr. Trump’s camp after House Democrats on Sept. 30 requested documents and testimony from him and Mr. Fruman. The men hired John Dowd, a lawyer who had earlier represented the president at one stage of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Mr. Trump signed off on the hiring of Mr. Dowd, according to an Oct. 2 email reviewed by The New York Times.</p>
      <p>“I have discussed the issue of representation with the president. The president consents to allowing your representation of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Furman,” Jay Sekulow, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, wrote to Mr. Dowd, misspelling Mr. Fruman’s surname.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dowd said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s approval was sought “simply as a courtesy to the president,” because of the lawyer’s previous work for him. Mr. Dowd said he still represents Mr. Fruman.</p>
      <p>A person close to Mr. Trump said that the email did not demonstrate that the president knew Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman personally but rather knew of them from media reports.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 3, when he still represented both men, Mr. Dowd wrote a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-10-03%20Fruman%20Parnas%20Counsel%20Dowd%20to%20HPSCI%20%28redacted%29.pdf">letter</a> to the House Intelligence Committee that implied that some of the materials the Democrats had asked the men to produce <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/nyregion/lev-parnas-igor-fruman-campaign-finance.html?module=inline">would be protected by attorney-client or executive privilege</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dowd told the Democrats that he could not determine how long it would take him to review documents for privilege and accused them of trying to “harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on talks with Mr. Parnas.</p>
      <p>Not long afterward, in an <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1886-indictment-giuliani-associates/a5dd834e350dc3b860c2/optimized/full.pdf#page=1">indictment</a> unsealed on Oct. 10, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman of illegally routing a $325,000 contribution to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump through a shell company and funneling campaign contributions from a Russian businessman to other United States politicians to influence them in support of a marijuana venture. They have both pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>House Democrats also sent Mr. Dowd <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2019-10-09.eec_engel_schiff_to_parnas_fruman_re_subpoena.pdf">subpoenas</a> for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on the same day the charges against them were unsealed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Parnas hired Mr. Giuliani in 2018 to help with a venture called Fraud Guarantee. But as of early this year, their relationship had shifted: Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman began assisting Mr. Giuliani in efforts to unearth negative information in Ukraine about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>That work lies close to the center of the investigation by House Democrats into whether Mr. Trump oversaw a shadow diplomatic campaign intended to smear a political opponent.</p>
      <p>While it is not clear what documents or testimony Mr. Parnas might provide, he was intimately involved with Mr. Giuliani’s efforts. Along with Mr. Fruman, he traveled repeatedly to Ukraine in search of information about corruption involving the Bidens and pushed for the ouster of the United States ambassador to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-trump-impeachment.html?module=inline">Marie L. Yovanovitch</a>, whom Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani saw as hostile to the president.</p>
