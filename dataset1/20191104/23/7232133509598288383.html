      <h1>Analyst: Ethereum Price Likely to Stagnate Until Bitcoin Gets Moving</h1>

      <p>After facing some downwards pressure yesterday, Ethereum (ETH) has been able to post a decent climb today that has allowed it to further establish its current foothold within the mid-$180 region. This price action has been strikingly similar to that of Bitcoin, and it does appear that the two assets are strongly correlated at the present.</p>
      <p>One prominent analyst is now noting that he anticipates Ethereum to continue consolidating until Bitcoin begins moving, but any decisive break above its near-term resistance could allow it to post significantly further gains in the near-term.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Consolidates Alongside Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/08/ethereum-forms-bottom-formation-as-analysts-see-room-to-fly/">Ethereum</a> is trading up over 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $186.26, which marks a notable surge from its daily lows of $179.9 that were briefly visited yesterday, although the crypto sharply bounced after touching this price level.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/04/microsoft-to-help-enterprises-mint-their-own-ethereum-tokens/#1c22ac8418f9">Ethereum</a> has been closely tracking Bitcoin’s price action over the past several days, and it appears that this correlation is strengthening as both crypto’s extend their current bout of consolidation.</p>
      <p>Nik Patel, a popular cryptocurrency analyst, discussed this in a recent <a href="https://www.altcointradershandbook.com/market-outlook-59/">blog post</a>, noting that its price may not move much until Bitcoin incurs a decisive trend in one direction or another.</p>
      <blockquote>“Ethereum seems a little unsure of itself at the moment, which is not unexpected given the volatility in Bitcoin of late; it almost seems as though it is awaiting Bitcoin’s next move before deciding on a direction,” he explained.</blockquote>
      <h3>Analyst: ETH Has Two Key Levels to Break Above in Near-Term</h3>
      <p>As for the resistance levels that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/23/bitcoin-bull-case-after-10-plunge-7400/">ETH</a> needs to break above in the near-term in order for it to incur a strong uptrend, Patel notes that it needs to break above its 360-day moving average and the resistance it currently has at $200.</p>
      <blockquote>“Looking at the ETH/USD chart, price spent the entire week consolidating below the $200 resistance and above the 360-day moving average, though I expect that this pair will mimic BTC/USD a little while longer whilst ETH/BTC figures out its next move,” he said while doubling down in the notion that ETH won’t move much until BTC does.</blockquote>
      <p>It is highly probable that the coming few days and weeks will prove to be quite illuminating when it comes to where <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/14/bitcoin-readies-for-next-big-move-after-slow-weekend/">ETH</a> and the entire crypto markets will head next.</p>
