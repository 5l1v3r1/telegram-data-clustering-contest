      <p>Germany plans to increase by half the grants available to buyers of electric cars over the five years from 2020, according to a government document seen by Reuters, the latest in a series of measures to speed the adoption of low-emissions vehicles.</p>
      <p>BERLIN: Germany plans to increase by half the grants available to buyers of electric cars over the five years from 2020, according to a government document seen by Reuters, the latest in a series of measures to speed the adoption of low-emissions vehicles.</p>
      <p>According to the document, due to be discussed at a meeting of high-level government and car-company officials on Monday evening, grants for plug-in hybrids will rise from 3,000 to 4,500 euros. For vehicles priced over 40,000 euros the grants will rise to 5,000 euros.</p>

      <p>The government wants to have 10 million electric vehicles on the roads by 2030, part of an offensive designed to turn round the German car industry's perceived laggard status in e-mobility compared to its rivals in the United States and China.</p>
      <p>The paper came to light on the day that Chancellor Angela Merkel gave a speech at Volkswagen's Zwickau factory, where the German watched the carmaker start mass production of its ID.3 electric car, a vehicle costing around 30,000 euros.</p>
      <p>"We can now say that Zwickau is a pillar of today's German auto industry and of its future," Merkel said at the launch. "Our task as politicians is to create a framework where new technological innovations can take hold."</p>
      <p>Merkel said the government would invest 3.5 billion euros (US$3.90 billion) to 2035 in building charging stations for electric cars.</p>
      <p>On Sunday she had said Germany needed 1 million charging stations by 2030 and urged carmakers and utility companies to play their part in helping to build the necessary infrastructure.</p>
      <p>As part of an auto industry push, BMW plans to build 4,000 electric car charging stations, a source familiar with the discussions said on Monday.</p>
      <p>In September, at the Frankfurt auto show, Europe's carmakers warned governments that the EU rules could be disastrous for profits and jobs because mainstream customers were not buying electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>German carmakers are accelerating plans to launch electric vehicles, under pressure from a European Union mandate to deliver a 37.5per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions between 2021 and 2030, on top of a 40per cent cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.</p>
