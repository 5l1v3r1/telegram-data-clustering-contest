UCP replaces NDP's opioid commission; vows 'new approach' to mental health and addiction
04 Nov 2019, 23:59 by Sammy Hudes
A 23-member panel tasked with improving access to mental health and addictions services will take “a different direction” than an outgoing group established by the former NDP government which focused on harm reduction, according to Jason Luan, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions.
The UCP-appointed Mental Health and Addictions Advisory Council is co-chaired by Pat Nixon, founder of the Mustard Seed, and Laureen MacNeil, executive director of the Canadian Mental Association’s Calgary chapter.
Luan unveiled the members of the group Monday, stating it will align with the government’s “recovery-oriented continuum of care” approach that focuses on finding improvements to prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery for mental health and addiction issues.
The council replaces the Minister’s Opioid Emergency Response Commission, established by the previous NDP government in May 2017 to tackle the opioid crisis through harm-reduction initiatives, treatment, prevention and other strategies. The group’s mandate was set to expire at the end of November.
Luan said the NDP “seemed to be excessively focused on a one-pillar approach” that focused simply on “managing the problem” through harm reduction.
“Our government and this council is committed to listening to voices of Albertan families, First Nations, business, people who are struggling and those who live in long-term recovery,” he said. “Our comprehensive approach will not only benefit people by saving lives and preventing them from suffering, but also create significant economic gain.”

Luan said addiction in Alberta costs $5.5 billion per year.
He said harm reduction would remain a component of the new panel’s approach, noting that five representatives of the previous group would remain on as ex-officio members.
But asked which new council members are harm-reduction advocates, Luan declined to answer.
The council will provide recommendations to the government on ways to improve access to a recovery-oriented system by next summer.
“Much work needs to be done to properly fund and organize our services into a safe, effective and easy-to-access system,” Luan said.
MacNeil said she hopes the group’s upcoming work will allow Albertans to “find the door that’s right for them at any point of their recovery journey.”
“My hope is that at the end of this process, that we have recommendations that everyone can see a solution or a support available for them and they will know the pathways that they can take, no different than if they had another chronic disease like diabetes or cancer,” she said.
Petra Schulz, who served on the outgoing panel, said she wasn’t surprised to find out the UCP wouldn’t be renewing its mandate.
“I’m very disappointed. This commission was constituted of people with a great level of expertise in public health, in addressing the overdose crisis,” said Schulz, whose 25-year-old son Danny died of a fentanyl overdose in 2014.
Schulz said the panel made recommendations that have helped save lives.
“We’re people with a broad range of expertise and I think we brought a lot to the table,” she said.
That was echoed by NDP mental health and addictions critic Heather Sweet, who said the opposition had concerns surrounding the appointment of “individuals who don’t have any harm-reduction experience.”



Sweet also took issue with Nixon’s position as co-chair, calling it a “very partisan appointment.” Nixon is the father of Government House Leader Jason Nixon, the Minister of Environment and Parks, as well as UCP MLA Jeremy Nixon.
“Why would they appoint someone that is so closely related to this government and not choose someone with just as many varieties of experience and expertise that doesn’t have that same connection?” said Sweet.
The provincial government is reviewing all supervised consumption sites across Alberta, including the Sheldon M. Chumir Safeworks site in Calgary.

Most recent statistics from Alberta Health Services show overdose rates at the facility have hit an all-time low since it opened two years ago, while visits are also stabilizing.
Jessica Holtsbaum, a co-founder of Change the Face of Addiction, said the UCP government’s rhetoric surrounding mental health and opioids has served to “polarize.”
“To pull the plug from harm reduction is ridiculous but I also want to make sure that recovery isn’t downplayed,” said Holtsbaum, whose brother died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016.
“Things have been painted that it’s harm reduction or recovery and that doesn’t really look at the whole picture. Recovery does include harm-reduction initiatives. Recovery does include abstinence. Recovery includes so many things and we can’t leave one at the expense of the other.”
