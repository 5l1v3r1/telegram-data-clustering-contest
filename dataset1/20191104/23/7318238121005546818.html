      <p>Spain is set to head to the polls this weekend in the fourth general election in just four years, but polls show that it is unlikely to break political deadlock.</p>
      <p>Polls released before this weekend's election predict that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialist party will win the most seats but still fall short of a majority. In April, a general election resulted in a fragmented Parliament.</p>
      <p>According to a survey by pollster 40dB for El Pais, Sanchez could win roughly 120 seats in the 350-seat Parliament.</p>
      <p>Far-right party Vox could become the third biggest party in the country after surging in the polls.</p>

      <p>Founder of poll aggregator Europe Elects, Tobias Gerhard Schminke told Euronews that voters in Spain have switched between parties since the 2008 financial crisis, making the election very unpredictable.</p>
      <p>Schminke said that Vox becoming the third biggest party would be a major success for them but that there are still several potential election outcomes.<br/><b><br/><a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/31/can-spain-end-political-stalemate-with-fourth-election-in-four-years">Read more: Can Spain end political stalemate with fourth election in four years?</a></b></p>
