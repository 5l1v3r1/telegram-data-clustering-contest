      <p>Premier League managers will meet with referees’ boss Mike Riley on Thursday to discuss the video assistant referee system, the PA news agency understands.</p>
      <p>Riley, general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for the country’s leading referees, will meet with the top-flight’s northern-based managers after sharing views with southern bosses last week.</p>
      <p>The meetings had been planned months ago, it is understood, but following the latest VAR controversies managers on Thursday will discuss whether match officials should be allowed to consult pitch-side monitors.</p>
      <p>Referees in all other competitions that currently use the VAR system are allowed to consult pitch-side monitors, but not in Premier League matches.</p>
