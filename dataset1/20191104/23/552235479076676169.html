      <h1>Scott Banks in Dundee United transfer blow as Crystal Palace target set for Tannadice exit</h1>
      <h2>The 18-year-old winger is on the verge of moving down south at the end of the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T23:15:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Crystal Palace target Scott Banks has knocked back a new deal and told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a> he will leave on freedom of contract.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old winger has played four times after a loan spell at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/clyde-fc">Clyde</a> last season.</p>
      <p>United will be due around £200,000 in training compensation with Banks now likely to move south at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/robbie-neilson">Robbie Neilson</a> has accused <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> of being short-sighted after they axed Craig Levein.</p>

      <p>The Tynecastle outfit fired the 55-year-old as manager and director of football last week.</p>
      <p>Dundee United boss Neilson, head coach at Jambos under Levein, said: “I’m disappointed for Craig. Look at what he’s done for the long term, taking the club from post administration, back to the Premiership, putting the youth academy in place, building structures.</p>
      <p>“It’s short-termism to move him.</p>
      <p>“Craig will probably take a little while to reflect, get the energy levels back up again but he will be back in football, no doubt.”</p>
