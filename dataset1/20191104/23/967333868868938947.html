      <p>An issue with the helicopter's tail rotor caused the aircraft to act erratically and prompted the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Bolivian town of Colquiri at around 12:48 p.m. local time, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Mision_Verdad/status/1191436728495722498?s=20">statement from Bolivia's Air Force</a>.</p>

      <p>Witnesses told the <a href="https://twitter.com/noticiasfides/status/1191420130124845058">Agencia de Noticias Fides</a> that the helicopter fell to the ground from approximately "15 meters high" during the landing.  </p>
      <blockquote>Morales, the 80th president of Bolivia, has served as the country's leader since 2006 and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910251077153094-bolivia-electoral-court-confirms-evo-morales-victory-in-presidential-elections---report/">recently won reelection with 47.08% of the vote</a>. </blockquote>
      <p>While Bolivian law does not require a runoff, as the head of the Movement to Socialism beat his main opponent Carlos Mesa by more than a 10% difference, the opposition leader <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910251077143785-argentina-brazil-colombia-us-call-on-bolivia-to-work-with-oas-to-ensure-credible-vote-count/">did not immediately accept the results</a>. </p>
      <p>Morales has fired back at assertions that his win was unjust and denounced related claims as an attempt to carry out a coup. </p>
      <blockquote>"A warning ... to all the people of Bolivia and the various social sectors that are preparing to carry out a coup d'etat this week: we have already been informed," <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910281077162939-bolivian-president-says-opposition-forces-preparing-coup-in-country/">he said</a>. </blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911021077204920-getting-desperate-us-seeks-to-delegitimize-bolivias-morales-with-oas-election-audit/">Organization of American States</a> has since began auditing the election's results. </p>
