      <p>At the Storage Developer Conference back in 2018, Microsoft Research <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-talks-about-project-silica-a-new-way-of-storing-data/">presented a new research paper</a> that discussed about how data can be stored in a glass using laser light. At Ignite conference today, Microsoft and Warner Bros. demoed a proof of concept representing this next generation of storage. Microsoft and Warner Bros. has stored the entire classic Superman movie on a 75 x 75 x 2 mm thick piece of glass. This is a great milestone for Microsoft Research.</p>
      <p>For the media and entertainment industry, film is still the current long-term storage solution—not digital. Glass storage provides a viable, virtually indestructible, and truly long-term storage solution, and Microsoft is eager to be pursuing this new technology as a cloud provider.</p>
