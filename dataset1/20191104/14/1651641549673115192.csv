As has been rumoured earlier, Microsoft has announced a new Office app for mobile devices at Ignite 2019 which combines a number of individual apps into a single monolithic app which includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
The new Office Mobile app also brings a new Action pane which lets users intuitively complete a variety of common on-the-go tasks, such as creating and signing PDFs and sharing files between devices.
Microsoft also showed off some additional cool features, such as taking a picture of a document and turning it into an editable Word document or a table into an editable Excel spreadsheet.
The feature list of the app includes:
   •  Create, edit, and work together on documents with others in real-time.   •  Store and access documents in the cloud or on your device.   •  Easily access recent and frequently used Word, Excel, PowerPoint files stored in the cloud or on your device.   •  Search for documents stored in the cloud, on your phone, or across your organization (if using a work account).Uniquely mobile ways that make document creation easier:   •  Snap a picture of a document and turn it into an editable Word file with the press of a button.   •  Transform a picture of a table into an Excel spreadsheet so you can work with the data.   •  Let PowerPoint help you design a presentation by simply selecting the pictures you want to use from your phone.   •  Create automatically enhanced digital images of whiteboards and documents with Office Lens features integrated into the app.Quickly perform common mobile tasks with in-built Actions:   •  Instantly create PDFs from photos or Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.   •  Sign PDFs using your finger.   •  Quickly jot down ideas and notes with Sticky Notes.   •  Easily transfer files between your phone and computer or share instantly with nearby mobile devices.   •  Scan QR codes to open files and links.
The Office mobile app is available in public preview starting today for Android and iOS.
