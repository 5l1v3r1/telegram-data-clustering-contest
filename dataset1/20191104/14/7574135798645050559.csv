Kacey Musgraves announces Christmas Special w/ Lana Del Rey, Dan Levy & more
04 Nov 2019, 14:53 by Bill Pearis



Kacey Musgraves is joining the likes of Dolly Parton, John Denver, Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash, in the country music tradition of having her own Christmas special. The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show will debut on Amazon Prime on November 29 (the day after Thanksgiving) and it features a very Kacey Musgraves group of guests: Lana Del Rey, Dan Levy (Schitt’s Creek, who also directs the special), Kendall Jenner, Zooey Deschanel, Fred Armisen, Leon Bridges, Troye Sivan, James Corden, Camila Cabello, and the Radio City Rockettes. Says Kacey:
What started as the small seed of an idea one night over a year ago has turned into something I’m so proud of. Some truly brilliant comedic and musical guests are featured in the show — as well as my own Grandma. My vision was to bring my old Christmas album to life visually and create a modern and fashionable, fresh take on a classic format. It’s a nostalgic, Wes Anderson-inspired reimagining of the holidays. It’s heartfelt, funny, and most of all, real. I can’t wait to finally share.
You can watch the campy, fun trailer for the special below. There will be an official soundtrack released for The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show on 11/29 as well.
Speaking of Kacey and Radio City, she played there just a few weeks ago.
