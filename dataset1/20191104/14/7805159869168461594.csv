November 2019 security patches roll out for the Pixel 2, 3, 4, and Essential Phone
04 Nov 2019, 14:48 by Joe Fedewa
As we kick off the first full week in November, Google is rolling out a new batch of Android security updates. This month is notable because it marks the end of monthly updates for the original Google Pixel and Pixel XL (RIP). We’ve still got patches for the Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Essential Phone, though.
This month, there is a pretty decent list of “Functional patches” for the entire Pixel 2 through Pixel 4. Two fixes, in particular, were included for only the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. Google previously talked about improvements to the 90Hz “Smooth Display,” and it appears some have been included this month. There’s also a bottom speaker improvement specifically for the Pixel 3.
