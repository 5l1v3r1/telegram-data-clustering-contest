      <h1>Rangers are overconfident and Celtic are unbeatable at Hampden - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Fraser Wilson takes your calls in the aftermath of Betfred Cup semi-final weekend at Hampden.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:18:41+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>The old saying ‘west is best and east is least’ might be a cheap quip but in terms of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi finals it was bang on the money.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> ’s hammering of Hibs and Rangers’ humbling of Hearts proved a gulf between the Glasgow and Edinburgh sides almost as wide as the M8 stretch that separates the cities.</p>
      <p>A first Old Firm cup final in eight years gave fans of both the green and blue sides of Glasgow a reason to hit the Hotline … as if they need one.</p>
      <p>And the banter was flowing. First up, <b>Alan McGaw, Alloa</b> , who said: “The Hampden hoodoo is over. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> were outstanding although I can’t believe how bad Hearts were. But Alfredo Morelos was magnificent again and what a change in the past year.</p>
      <p>“I thought when Daniel Candeias left he would go into his shell but he is now talking with his feet and not his mouth.</p>
      <p>“The final will have a big say in the destination of the league title as it will give one club a huge momentum boost."</p>

      <p><b>Bob Shearer</b> emailed: “Celtic fans go on about how Morelos hasn't scored against the big teams. Well 20 goals at the start of November, would they want him in their squad? Answers on a postcard please.”</p>
      <p><b>Alfie Mullin, London</b> , responded to a call from last week saying: “Adam Ryan from Croy, says I must be at my wits end and maybe Celtic should give me some shifts polishing silverware.</p>
      <p>“Why would I want to go there when the silverware is coming to Ibrox?”</p>
      <p>But <b>Lewis Doyle, Limerick</b> , said: “Here we go it’s started - ‘the biggest cup final since 1923’. And here’s me thinking that Rangers don't exist now.</p>
      <p>“The new Rangers players will be saying 'bring on Celtic' and at the end of the match Broony will say what he always says: 'We do our talking on the pitch'.</p>
      <p>“Yes Hearts got thumped but most of their first team squad was in the stand injured. So word of warning to those blinded by lack of silverware keep schtum.”</p>

      <p><b>Pat Thompson, Parkhead</b> , was full of praise for the rampant Hoops: “To win 30 cup ties in a row is sensational, I couldn’t believe it.</p>
      <p>“But it seems any side that wants to win a cup will have to beat Celtic before the semi-final stage as they look unbeatable at Hampden.</p>
      <p>“They know that pitch inside out and another win is coming next month.</p>
      <p>“Rangers are too confident and Celtic have the better players.”</p>
      <p><b>Kenny Wilson from Moffat</b> agreed, saying: “It’s good to hear the Rangers fans saying bring on Celtic, we are better in every area of the pitch. I seem to remember hearing that before the game at Ibrox earlier in the season.”</p>
      <p>And <b>James Kennedy, Kilsyth</b> , emailed: “So Morelos will not be sold in January. Rangers are skint and living on borrowed time and money. Will they stop paying their bills again? I sense another Valentines Day massacre on the way.”</p>
      <p>While there was a glow around Glasgow it was very much doom and gloom in Gorgie and Leith.</p>
      <p><b>Stephen Johnstone, Ardentinny,</b> said: “There’s more chance of Nanny MacPhee saving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> than Austin MacPhee. The Jambos were garbage and there’s more than Craig Levein that should be leaving Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>“They should put a for sale sign outside the stadium and every player should be cleared out. It’s a shambles.”</p>

      <p><b>Frank McFerran, Carrickfergus</b> , emailed: “As a Rangers fan I’m glad to see my team doing well and it’s about time. But I can’t understand what has happened to the two Edinburgh teams. They were always a threat before, not now.”</p>
      <p>Away from the semi-finals and <b>Jim McClean from Rothesay</b> is not enamoured with Killie boss Angelo Alessio after the Ayrshiremen’s rise came to an abrupt halt against Motherwell.</p>
      <p>He said: “I wonder what’s on Angelo Alessio’s mind, two nothing down after 27 mins and still plays one up front for the remainder of the game, clueless. Just go Angelo. I know we had injuries but have a go and don’t use it as excuses, it could have been six or seven except our goalkeeper was excellent.”</p>
      <p>And last word to <b>Izzy Currie, Caithness</b> , who wasn’t impressed by England’s lack of respect after losing the Rugby World Cup Final to South Africa. She said: “I saw some of the England players didn’t put their runners-up medals round their necks or even worse took them straight back off.</p>
      <p>“It was disrespectful and if I’d been there then I would have booted their backsides.”</p>
      <p>Hear hear Izzy.</p>
