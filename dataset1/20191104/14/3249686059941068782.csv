TWICE's Jeongyeon Volunteers in an Animal Shelter with Actress Gong Seungyeon
04 Nov 2019, 14:07 by HelloAnon



Jeongyeon of popular Kpop girl group TWICE recently volunteered at Anseong Animal Shelter with her sister, lead actress of ""Flower Crew: Joseon Marriage Agency"", Gong Seungyeon.
Aside from donating supplies, the two generously spent their rest day to do cleaning and other tasks at the shelter.
A compilation video of their activities when they volunteered was uploaded by the shelter today.












Jeongyeon and Seungyeon both have soft spots for animals and have been donating and volunteering at animal shelters for quite some time now. They even tagged along another TWICE member, Momo, last year when they visited and spent time with the dogs at the animal shelter.









Fans are always delighted to see the two sisters bond with each other as they do charity works and both have continuously inspired others to be more compassionate and do volunteering as well.
