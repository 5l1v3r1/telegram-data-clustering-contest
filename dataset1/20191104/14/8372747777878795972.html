      <p>PASCO COUNTY, Fla. -- Deputies have arrested two Port Richey residents after they say an unsupervised child fell off a 2nd-story balcony and they did not call for medical care.</p>
      <p>It happened Friday evening at Wind Tree Apartments in Port Richey.</p>
      <p>According to a Pasco County Sheriff's Office report, a first floor neighbor heard thud outside and found a 14-month old child crying and limping. The neighbor looked up and saw a hole in the screen of a 2nd floor apartment and brought the child to the door.</p>
      <p>The man who answered the door grabbed the child and closed the door. Fearing that the child needed medical attention, the neighbor called 911.</p>
      <p>Investigators talked to a man and woman who live at the home where the child appeared to fall from, and were given inconsistent stories about what happened and what they saw.</p>
      <p>Deputies arrested 24-year-old Cristina Jiminez-Gomez and 23-year-old David Gomez-Diaz. Both are charged with Child Neglect.</p>
      <p>The child was flown to St. Joe's Hospital for treatment to internal injuries. There's no word on their condition.</p>
