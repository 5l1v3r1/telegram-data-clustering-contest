從細胞到星系 科學家看到合作契機

04 Nov 2019, 14:01

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】科學家發現，在微觀細胞和宏觀星系之間，從使用的探索方法到適用的物理規律，有著驚人的相似之處，如果這兩大領域的科學家可以合作，也許能解決很多難題。
美國著名天文學家卡爾•薩根（Carl Sagan）曾說:「我們都是來自恆星的物質。」構成我們身體的原子是從久遠以前死亡的恆星的內部形成的，因此當我們仰望宇宙的時候我們看到的是我們自己。這聽起來像優美的詩歌，可是從現在的各種成像技術，科學家發現了有趣的共同點。
射電天文學向人們展示了宇宙的各種面貌。天學家蒐集來自太空的各種微弱信號，輸入電腦，利用軟件將數據生成較為直觀的各種圖像。人們研究人體用的掃瞄技術，比如核磁共振（MRI）也是這個道理。無需侵入式手術，即可探知人體內部的某些構造。醫療成像術和天文學的成像技術在數據蒐集和分析上是大同小異的。兩個領域的研究人員連遇到的困難都有相似之處，如果能夠合作，必定有可以互相借鑒之處。
這正是「細胞到星系」（Cells to Galaxies）項目的目標：找到兩個領域之間的橋樑，一個領域發明的方法，很可能對另一個領域也適用。兩個領域還可以合作解決兩個領域的大難題。
維吉尼亞大學（University of Virginia）電氣與計算機工程助理教授韋勒（Daniel Weller）說，兩個領域最大的不同在於術語和文化方面。每個領域已經形成了各自的術語和風格，要讓合作有成果，兩個領域的學者必須熟悉對方領域的知識，才能更好的利用兩者的共同之處。
位於紐約的軟件公司Kitware醫療信息部負責人帕尼亞瓜（Beatriz Paniagua）認為，兩個領域最大的區別之一在於，生物成像領域可以「觸碰到源頭」，意思是說如果從成像結果中看到病患體內的異常，生物領域總是有辦法用接觸的方式進行證實。而在射電天文學領域，「病患」都是以光年度量的遙遠天體，接觸它們是辦不到的。
美國國家射電天文臺（NRAO）的巴特那加（Sanjay Bhatnagar）看到兩個領域合作的巨大潛力。他說現代射電望遠鏡和醫療成像設備，都能得到大量的數據，兩者共同的一個很大的挑戰是如何從這樣大量的數據中構建出準確的圖像。
今年4月，一組射電天文學家和醫療成像專家在維吉尼亞州夏洛茨維爾（Charlottesville）會晤，交換研究成果，討論是否有共通之處。會議的結果令人興奮。巴特那加說：「我很高興，幾乎所有我交談過的人都感到這個會議十分有有趣。」
研究人員計劃於2020年春季舉行一次更正式的合作會議。

Scientists see cooperation opportunities from cells to galaxies

04 Nov 2019, 14:01

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Scientists have found that there are striking similarities between microscopic cells and macroscopic galaxies, from the use of exploration methods to the applicable physical laws, if scientists in these two fields can Cooperation may solve many problems.
Carl Sagan, a famous American astronomer, once said: ""We are all substances from stars."" The atoms that make up our body are formed from the interior of stars that died long ago, so when we look up to the universe, we What we see is ourselves. It sounds like beautiful poetry, but scientists have found interesting commonalities from the various imaging technologies available today.
Radio astronomy shows people the various aspects of the universe. The celestial scientist collects various weak signals from space, inputs them into the computer, and uses the software to generate more intuitive images. Scanning techniques for human body research, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI), are also true. Certain structures inside the body can be detected without invasive surgery. Medical imaging and astronomical imaging techniques are similar in data collection and analysis. Researchers in both fields have similarities in their difficulties. If they can cooperate, there must be something to learn from each other.
This is the goal of the ""Cells to Galaxies"" project: finding a bridge between two domains, a method of inventing a field that is likely to apply to another. The two areas can also work together to solve big problems in two areas.
Daniel Weller, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia, said the biggest difference between the two areas is in terms of terms and culture. Each field has formed its own terminology and style. To make the cooperation fruitful, scholars in both fields must be familiar with the knowledge of each other's fields in order to make better use of the commonalities of the two.
Beatriz Paniagua, head of medical information at Kitware, a software company based in New York, believes that one of the biggest differences between the two areas is that the bio-imaging field can ""touch the source,"" meaning if it is from imaging results. When you see abnormalities in your patients, there is always a way to confirm them in the biological field. In the field of radio astronomy, ""patients"" are distant objects with a light annual amount, and it is impossible to contact them.
Sanjay Bhatnagar of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) sees great potential for cooperation in both areas. He said that modern radio telescopes and medical imaging equipment can get a lot of data. A big challenge is how to build accurate images from such a large amount of data.
In April of this year, a group of radio astronomers and medical imaging experts met in Charlottesville, Virginia, to exchange research findings and discuss whether there is something in common. The results of the meeting were exciting. Patnagar said: ""I am very happy. Almost everyone I have talked to feels that this meeting is very interesting.""
The researchers plan to hold a more formal cooperation meeting in the spring of 2020.
