      <h1>One in five Brits has sex just three times a year, survey shows</h1>
      <h2>A new survey by has revealed that 22% of Brits are leading a virtually sexless existence, having sex just three times a year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:38:52+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:38</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>If you’re not getting much action in the bedroom, you’ll be relieved to hear that you’re not alone.</p>
      <p>A new survey by zaucey.com has revealed that 22% of Brits are leading a virtually <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sexual-health">sexless</a> existence, having <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sex-tips">sex</a> just three times a year.</p>
      <p>The online platform surveyed 2,002 Brits about their sex lives, and found that 30% of Brits claim they don’t have time for sex, while 20% simply ‘can’t be bothered.’</p>
      <p>The results also showed that for 14% of Brits, their partner’s fatigue is to blame for a lack of bedroom action, while 13% think a lack of spark in their relationship is responsible.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the spectrum, just 6% report that they have sex daily. This means that on average, Brits have sex just once every 75 days.</p>

      <p>The survey also raises questions about people’s motives for having sex.</p>
      <p>While 52% of respondents said that when they have sex it’s because they want to, only 41% said that they have sex because they think it’s fun or it makes them happy.</p>
      <p>Sadly, 17% said that they have sex because it’s what’s expected in a relationship.</p>
      <p>Based on the findings, the researchers are campaigning for better sex in the UK, with the hashtag #AtLeastOnceAWeek.</p>
      <p>Anna Kieran, Director of zaucey.com, said: “Sex is a necessary part of our lives, it’s a kind of self-care, and it’s the basis of a healthy relationship.</p>
      <p>"Something needs to be done, so we’re calling on people up and down the nation to have sex #AtLeastOnceAWeek.”</p>
