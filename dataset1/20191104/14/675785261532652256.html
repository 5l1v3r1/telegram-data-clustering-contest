      <h1>Arsenal 'axe eight staff members' including head of youth scouting in extensive overhaul</h1>
      <h2>Steve Morrow, who was head of youth scouting at Arsenal, is among those who have parted company with the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:50:39+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have axed a staggering eight members of staff as part of an extensive behind-the-scenes overhaul, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Among those to leave the north London club is head of youth scouting Steve Morrow, who was told he is no longer needed in his role.</p>
      <p>Morrow represented the Gunners as a player from 1988 to 1997, and famously scored the winner in the 1993 Coca-Cola Cup final against Sheffield Wednesday before being dropped by Tony Adams in the post-match celebrations and breaking his arm.</p>
      <p>The others staff members who are believed to have been axed include Kevin Beadell, Dan Rice and Dave Lee, who each held recruitment positions at the Emirates.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7647641/Arsenal-AXE-head-youth-scouting-Steve-Morrow-Gunners-ditch-1993-League-Cup-hero.html?__twitter_impression=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Daily Mail</a> reports that the departures are yet to be formally confirmed by the club, but the wheels are firmly in motion.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery was recently given reassurances over his job at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> despite results continuing to go against him and fans growing increasingly frustrated.</p>
      <p>Emery's Gunners have won just two of their past nine fixtures in the Premier League and have thrown away points from winning positions.</p>

      <p>Against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> earlier in the season Arsenal were leading by two goals to nil but were pegged back in the second half and drew 2-2.</p>
      <p>Against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> it was a similar story with Arsenal storming into a two goal lead, but coming away with just a single point from the match.</p>

      <p>And finally, last time out against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> the Gunners went ahead thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and lead for most of the match.</p>
      <p>But a Raul Jimenez goal ten minutes before the end ensured the Midlands side returned home from London with a point.</p>
