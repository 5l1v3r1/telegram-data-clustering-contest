      <h2>Stoke City v West Brom | The Baggies will target a move back to the Championship summit when they face the Potters tonight - but the hosts will want a response following Nathan Jones' departure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:28:26+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Darnell Furlong is expecting West Bromwich Albion to come up against a "fighting" Stoke City side when they meet in the Championship tonight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">The Baggies</a> head to the bet365 Stadium knowing a victory will return them to the top of the table, while the Potters begin life without Nathan Jones, following his sacking as manager last week.</p>
      <p>Stoke are bottom of the division after 14 matches, having won only twice this season.</p>
      <p>But West Brom full-back <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/darnell-furlong">Furlong</a> - who has made 12 appearances so far in 2019-20 - believes the Potters' current situation could make them dangerous opposition.</p>

      <p>"That's the problem with them - we know they are going to be fighting at the moment, they're going to be really strong with their attitude and we know what type of football to expect," he told <a href="https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2019/november/furlong-ready-for-fight-from-stoke/">the club's website.</a></p>
      <p>"They’ve got a lot of big names, a lot of signings in the summer who are trying to prove themselves, so it’s going to be a very tough game.</p>
      <p>"There are no easy games in the Championship but that is going to be an extremely tough one.</p>
      <p>"I was at QPR with Jordan Cousins last season and when he went there I thought, that’s a great move for him, they’re going to be challenging at the top end of the table.</p>
