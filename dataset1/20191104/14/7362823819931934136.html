      <h1>Warren under fire on ‘Medicare-for-all’ as she now claims billionaires alone can fund it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:50:02+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Brooke Singman</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is facing deepening skepticism, including from some in her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-defends-medicare-for-all-math-as-funding-plan-faces-bipartisan-fire">own party,</a> over her "Medicare-for-all" plan -- as she not only claims the middle class won’t be hit with a tax hike but even suggests billionaires alone can fund it.</p>
      <p>As Fox News first reported, Warren on Friday outlined a plan costing $52 trillion over the next decade, including $20 trillion in new spending -- covered largely by an array of taxes on corporations, the wealthy and employers in general. While insisting the middle class would be spared, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Warren</a>, D-Mass., went a step further in Dubuque, Iowa, over the weekend when pressed by reporters.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“It doesn’t raise taxes on anybody but billionaires,” Warren said. “And you know what, the billionaires can afford it, and I don’t call them middle class.”</p>
      <p>When pressed again whether anyone with under $1 billion net worth would feel a tax hike, she said: “That’s right—not paying a penny more.”</p>
      <p>“Understand this. This is no increase in taxes for anyone except billionaires,” she said. “Period. Done.”</p>

      <p>The Joe Biden campaign fired back that Warren's statement was "simply not true."</p>
      <p>"Her plan would create a new tax on employers of almost $9 trillion that would come out of workers' pockets, a new financial transaction tax that would impact investments held by middle class Americans, and a new capital gains tax that would affect far more people than she stated tonight," Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Warren campaign’s detailed Medicare-for-all plan claims costs can be covered by a combination of existing federal and state spending on Medicare and other health care—as well as taxes on employers, financial transactions, the ultra-wealthy and large corporations, and some savings elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Notably, they include what is essentially a nearly $9 trillion payroll tax increase on employers—something economists generally say can hit workers in the form of reduced wages. Biden's campaign argues this would certainly hit the middle class.</p>
      <p>Warren’s proposal, as she referenced in Iowa, indeed calls for a tax increase explicitly on billionaires, expanding a previously announced wealth tax to hit them harder.</p>
      <p>However, the plan also calls for raising capital gains taxes for the "top 1%."</p>
      <p>Even The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-health-plan-billionaires.html">New York Times</a> noted this would extend beyond billionaires, reporting: "In 2017, the top 1 percent of tax returns had income above roughly $515,000, according to the Internal Revenue Service -- about 1.4 million tax returns in total."</p>
      <p>A Warren campaign spokesperson later walked back her weekend statement, telling the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-health-plan-billionaires.html">Times</a> that the Massachusetts senator was referring specifically to her wealth tax proposal when she said taxes would only increase for billionaires -- acknowledging that taxes would increase for the top 1 percent under the plan.</p>
      <p>But the campaign faces skepticism beyond the debate over the billionaire burden.</p>
      <p>A recent study released by the bipartisan <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/funding-medicare-for-all-taxes-rich-impossible-study">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</a> declared it would be "impossible" to finance any such plan using only taxes on the wealthiest Americans.</p>
      <p>And The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/warren-has-a-fantasy-plan-11572822962">Wall Street Journal</a> editorial board challenged other calculations, especially her claim that the plan would translate to $20 trillion in additional spending, whereas other estimates for Medicare-for-all have put the cost roughly $10 trillion higher.</p>
      <p>“That leaves $30 trillion to finance, but Senator Warren waves her wand and says the bill will really be $20.5 trillion. She makes the rest vanish by positing magical savings from things like ‘comprehensive payment reform,’” the Journal wrote.</p>
      <p>The Biden campaign also charged that "Senator Warren has been lowballing the cost of her plan by well over $10 trillion while overcounting the revenue that would be gained from the sources she identifies. The bottom line? Even more tax increases on the middle class will be inevitable."</p>
      <p>Medicare-for-all’s chief Senate champion Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has pitched a plan estimated to cost an extra $32 trillion over 10 years. Sanders told ABC News over the weekend that his proposal is “far more progressive” than Warren’s, and said that her plan could have a “very negative impact” on the economy and job creation.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“The function of health care is to provide health care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profits for the insurance companies and the drug companies. So, Elizabeth Warren and I agree on that,” Sanders told ABC News. “We do disagree on how you fund it. I think the approach that I have, in fact, will be much more progressive in terms of protecting the financial well-being of middle-income families.”</p>
      <p>Sanders has acknowledged that his Medicare-for-all plan would raise taxes on the middle class, but he argues it would lower the cost of health care for most Americans.</p>
      <p>Biden himself slammed Warren’s numbers in a Friday interview with PBS. “She’s making it up,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh blasted Warren's plan Friday as a "total disaster."</p>
      <p>“There are 52 trillion reasons why this plan is a total disaster," Murtaugh told Fox News. "Best of luck to the fact checkers who now have to clean up the mess.”</p>
