      <h1>Report: Apple is partnering with Valve to develop AR Headset</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:32:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Raka</a></address>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191104PD209.html">report</a> by <i>Digitimes</i>, Apple is partnering with Valve, an American video game developer, publisher, and digital distribution company, to develop its AR headset. The report also claims that the headset will be launched next year.</p>
      <blockquote>Apple reportedly has partnered with US game developer Valve to develop AR head-mounted display devices, which may be released in the second half of 2020 at the earliest, with Taiwan’s ODMs Quanta Computer and Pegatron said to handle the assembly job, according to industry sources.</blockquote>
      <p>The two companies worked together back in 2017 to add native VR headset support to macOS High Sierra. This time around, however,  the focus area is AR, not VR.</p>
      <blockquote>Apple will cooperate with Valve on AR headsets rather than VR devices, as its CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> believes that AR can make digital content become part of the user’s world and will be as popular as smartphones with consumers. This has also promoted Apple to step up the development of AR software by recruiting more engineers for graphic design, system interface and system architecture segments.</blockquote>
      <p>Apple’s upcoming AR headset has been in the news for long, but they’re all rumors until the release of the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-ar-headset-confirmed-apple-employees-are-already-testing-it/">iOS 13 final build, along with which came a read me file that mentioned steps for developers on how to test AR apps without the AR headset</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-08/apple-is-said-to-ramp-up-work-on-augmented-reality-headset"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>, Apple’s AR headset will be powered by a new OS dubbed “rOS,” which will, of course, be developed by Apple. While we still don’t know the name of Apple’s AR headset, the device is expected to hit the market in the second half of 2020.</p>
