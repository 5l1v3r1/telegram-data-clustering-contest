      <p>FKA Twigs’ new album, <i>MAGDALENE</i>, is out at the end of the week. We’ve heard a handful of tracks from it already — “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2041052/fka-twigs-cellophane/video/">Cellophane</a>,” <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057487/fka-twigs-future-holy-terrain-skrillex-jack-antonoff-magdalene/video/">Holy Terrain</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060501/fka-twigs-home-with-you-video/video/">Home With You</a>” — and last week Twigs was on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> to give <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063424/watch-fka-twigs-incredible-stripper-pole-fallon-performance/video/">a late-night performance</a> for the history books. Today, she’s sharing one final single before <i>MAGDALENE</i> is out in full, “sad day,” which finds Twigs pining, “Would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love.”</p>
      <p>A music video is in the works for “sad day” that’s directed by Hiro Murai, his first music video since Childish Gambino’s “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1994871/childish-gambino-this-is-america/video/">This Is America</a>.” A <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/fka-twigs-interview/">Pitchfork story</a> took place during the filming of it, and it apparently involves Twigs doing <i>wushu</i>, a Chinese martial art that involves sword-fighting. It’s not attached to “sad day” the song just yet, but the track’s YouTube embed does feature a still that seemingly comes from it.</p>
