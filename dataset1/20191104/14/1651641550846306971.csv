04 Nov 2019, 14:56 by Ash

Xbox’s latest Elite controller, the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, is now officially up for purchase in most countries.

While the controller sports a price tag of $179.99/£159.99, it’s worth it for what you get. With adjustable-tension thumbsticks, shorter hair trigger locks, wrap-around rubberised grip, and re-engineered components, this controller is made for those who want to get the absolute best out of their games.
The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 also offers intimate customisation options thanks to its interchangeable thumbsticks and paddles and its range of button remapping options.
With six adjustable thumbsticks (two standard, two classic, one tall, and one wide dome) and four modifiable paddles (two medium, two mini), you can adjust your controller exactly to your liking and have full control over the way you play.



The thumbsticks are even adjustable-tension, meaning you can change the resistance to work with your hands. All these customisation options give you over 30 new and different ways to play like a pro.
What’s more is that the controller isn’t just limited to Xbox One players – the Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 utilises Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, and the included USB-C cable in order to allow you to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 devices.
Here’s what you get in the box:

Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2
Carrying case
Set of 6 thumbsticks: Standard (2), Classic (2), Tall (1), Wide Dome (1)
Set of 4 paddles: Medium (2), Mini (2)
Set of 2 D-pads: Standard, Faceted
Thumbstick-adjustment tool
Charging dock
USB-C cable

You can pick up the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 at the Microsoft Store by following the link here. If the controller isn’t available in your region yet, don’t worry – Microsoft aims to have the controller out in all markets before the end of December.
For more controller ideas, you can check out the Official MSPoweruser Xbox Holiday Gift Guide. Happy gaming!
