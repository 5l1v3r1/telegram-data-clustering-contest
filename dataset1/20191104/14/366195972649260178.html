      <p>Rod Wave is barely out of his teens but he's surely on his way to greatness. Over the past year, his soulful vocals have helped him stand-out among the regional sound coming out of Florida right now. With Alamo Records backing him, and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KevinGates/profile">Kevin Gates</a> serving as the executive producer, Rod Wave released <i>Ghetto Gospel</i> this past Friday. Rod Wave showcases different sides of his artistry from the gospel-influenced records to straight trap bangers on <i>Ghetto Gospel</i>. Keeping the features to a minimum on the fourteen track project, he recruits the project's executive producer, Kevin Gates, who appears on "Cuban Links" and "Titanic," and his labelmate <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lildurk/profile">Lil Durk</a> who pops out for the "Heart On Ice" remix.</p>
