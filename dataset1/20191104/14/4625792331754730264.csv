04 Nov 2019, 14:35 by Mike Brest
The Cleveland Browns have cut safety Jermaine Whitehead after he posted threatening messages on social media following the team's Sunday loss to the Denver Broncos.
Whitehead drew the ire of fans and critics on social media after he missed two big tackles during the game. One of those missed tackles resulted in the opposing player score a 75-yard touchdown. He then fired back at the criticism on Twitter after the game, which led to the team's decision to release him.
He tweeted, ""Don't get shot at lil bitch ... can you whoop my ass.. f--- football... let me know when you need the address,"" after an unverified Twitter user disparaged his play on the field. Whitehead then responded to another user, taking him up on the opportunity to fight before calling that person a ""cracker.""



The former safety then threatened another user, saying, ""Imma kill you bitch.. that's on blood,"" and his account was suspended shortly after his outburst.
""Jermaine Whitehead's social media posts following today's game were totally unacceptable and highly inappropriate,"" a Browns spokesperson said in a statement Sunday night, according to ESPN.



He later issued an apology for his poor play on Instagram but didn't address the comments he made afterward.
""Crazy world. They line it up and say anything in the book too you,"" he said in the caption of a photo. ""They tell you take the high road, when yo whole life you was taught to meet fire with fire. I do apologize for my performance, but having a broke hand and a strong fear of letting my team down is my downfall. Whatever happens happens. Ain trippin. They probably gone still talk crazy but this me getting smoke off my chest. I don't need one like.. this from me to me! Keep ya head up homie, can't nobody f--- with you. I dare em to try.""
