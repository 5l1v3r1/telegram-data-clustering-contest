A pregnant woman in Lithia, Florida, used an AR-15 to kill an alleged home intruder while her husband was under attack.

Breitbart News reported the incident happened Wednesday and the woman retrieved a gun after two suspects allegedly entered a home and began pistol-whipping the husband.
The woman fired one shot, striking one of the suspects, who then ran outside, collapsed in a ditch, and died. The second suspect fled the scene.
Bay News 9 reports the woman was pregnant at the time of the alleged home intrusion, and she used an AR-15 to defend her husband and home.
The husband, Jeremy King, described the harrowing incident: “They came in heavily hooded and masked. As soon as they had got the back door opened, they had a pistol on me and was grabbing my 11-year-old daughter.”
He indicated his wife grabbed the AR-15, shot and hit one of the suspects. That suspect “made it from my back door to roughly 200 feet out in the front ditch before the AR did its thing.”
