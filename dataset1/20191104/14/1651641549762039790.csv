04 Nov 2019, 14:14 by Pradeep





Microsoft Bot Framework allows developers to easily create powerful bots by taking advantage of Azure and AI services. At Ignite 2019, Microsoft announced Power Virtual Agents, a new service that will allow anyone to create a bot without writing a single line of code. This will help subject matter experts in organizations to create their bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface.
Also, Power Virtual Agents is already integrated with Microsoft’s Power Platform, allowing them to use hundreds of pre-built connectors available via Power Automate. If the bot needs advanced features, you can take advantage of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services and Bot Framework which are fully integrated within this new service.
Microsoft Power Virtual Agents is available today in public preview.
