Dotted around Edinburgh’s city center are a number of traffic signs that have been given new life through playful, amusing graffiti stickers. A keen eye may spot a sumo wrestler, a spilled glass of wine, or a geometric cat—just a few of the nearly two dozen total signs.
They are the work of French artist Clet Abraham, who hand-draws the designs, prints them onto sticker paper and goes out at night to place them. Abraham first began placing his stickers in Edinburgh in the Spring of 2018, and has done similar projects in London, Paris, Barcelona, and Rome.
The signs have been manipulated in such a way as to not interfere with a driver’s ability to interpret the meaning. Abraham is careful not not to cover up more than 10% of the sign. No word from Edinburgh City Council as whether they have any plans to remove the artworks.
Know Before You Go
Locating the signs is a bit of a scavenger hunt. The majority of them can be found around St. Andrew Square, on South St. David Street, Thistle Street, and Union Street.
