      <p>Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing President of the European Commission, has defended his kiss-on-the-cheek, slap-on-the-back greetings with foreign leaders.</p>
      <p>“I am who I am,” he said in <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-eu-commission-president-jean-claude-juncker-a-1294486.html">a wide-ranging interview</a> with the German magazine Der Spiegel published last week. “I sometimes think the worst thing about prison is that you don't experience physical closeness. I can't at all imagine not touching other people or not being touched by other people.”</p>
      <blockquote>“My staff sometimes warns me not to hug this or that person,” he added. “But I've been kissed by Erdogan, so I kiss him, too. I kissed Putin and I was kissed by Putin. In either case, it certainly didn’t hurt Europe.”</blockquote>
      <h3>On countering Brexit</h3>
      <p>In the same interview, the 64-year-old Juncker lamented that he didn’t try to rally Britons to vote Remain back in 2016.</p>
      <p>“I had many invitations, but [then-British Prime Minister David] Cameron made it clear that he didn't have any use for me. The European Commission is even less popular in Britain than it is on the Continent,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“Looking at it today, I think that was a big mistake. So many lies were told, including by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them.”</p>
      <h3>On young eco-activists</h3>
      <p>Jean-Claude Juncker also took a slight dig at the international youth climate change movement, which has largely gained traction due to Swedish eco-warrior Greta Thunberg.</p>
      <p>While praising the Paris climate agreement and other long-term environmental strategies, the former EU executive said: “I really like young people getting involved, but I am also not naive. Much of what is being presented there in such sentimental terms is not so easy to achieve in reality. Classical industry must continue to have a home in Europe.”</p>
      <h3>On winning over Donald Trump</h3>
      <p>Juncker recounted how he managed to win Donald Trump’s respect. Assertiveness was the key, he revealed:</p>
      <blockquote>“In Washington, Trump told me about all the people from Europe who had already been to the Oval Office before me — the chancellor, presidents, prime ministers. And I told him: They are all important, but you spoke to the wrong people. The European Commission is responsible for trade policy, not the member states. That impressed him.”</blockquote>
      <p>He once told Trump that the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial – administered by the US government – is an “American territory.”</p>
      <p>“That touched Trump deeply. These are the kinds of small things that can open hearts.”</p>
      <h3>A delay to the start of a new EU Commission</h3>
      <p>Juncker, who served as the prime minister of Luxembourg for 18 years before heading the European Union’s executive arm, was expected to step down on Friday, 1 November, at the end of his five-year term. His successor is Ursula von der Leyen, Germany’s former defence minister.</p>
      <p>However, the commission president-select faced a delay taking office after European MEPs <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910121077034744-french-media-mock-sore-loser-macron-over-losing-goulards-european-commission-nomination/">rejected France’s pick as next European commissioner</a>, Sylvie Goulard, over a 2017 fake jobs scandal and her past high-paid work for an American think-tank.</p>
      <p>The European Parliament had earlier also snubbed Hungarian and Romanian choices for the Commission over allegations of corruption.</p>
      <p>Juncker is to undergo an aneurysm surgery on 11 November. The vetting process for von der Leyen’s team is still underway, and is complicated by <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910101077009614-romanian-parliament-passes-motion-of-no-confidence-in-prime-minister-dancilas-government-/">political uncertainty in Romania</a>, where a two-round presidential election will take place this month.</p>
