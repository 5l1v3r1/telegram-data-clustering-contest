《台灣史論叢 移民篇》：台灣人何以到寒冷的滿洲國找出路？
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是在滿洲國待遇比在日本、台灣為高，不少台灣人都受此條件吸引，也很滿意當時的薪資。台灣人選擇去滿洲還有一個原因是，在戰爭後期日本物資缺乏，又有被美國空襲的危險，因而選擇到滿洲。



文：許雪姬
【滿洲國政府中的台籍公務人員（1932-1945）】
（前略）
三、台灣人到滿洲的背景
台灣人何以到寒冷的滿洲國找出路，其主要原因為何？在滿洲國的中央政府中以哪些部門的台灣人為多？有哪些人當上高等官（特任、簡任、薦任）？
（一）台灣人到滿洲國的原因
台灣人到滿洲的主要原因，筆者曾在一篇探討在滿洲國和汪精衛政權下的台灣人之文章中，提出四個共同原因，一是求學，二是求職，三是經商，四是抵抗日本人的統治，但到滿洲國的背景較為複雜。首先台灣在1895年割讓給日本，當時屬清朝統治，而滿洲國的執政、皇帝是溥儀，對台灣人來說，那是前清的統治者，到滿洲國多少有「故國」之思。謝汝銓在其詩〈滿洲國創立有賦〉，稱滿洲建國是「漢人無憤滿人愉」，稱滿洲國的執政為「匈奴今有大單于」；另一詩〈滿洲國頒帝制溥儀執政即位謹賦〉，提到：「縱說新邦仍舊國　翻欣執政作興王。」在〈寄滿洲國外交總長同宗介石君〉一詩中，稱讚謝是佐清室偏安的謝安，可見一斑。而在滿洲國成立時當特任官的外交部總長謝介石，曾參與之前1917年7月1日張勳等的溥儀復辟行動，還被任為前敵司令，並做了12天外交部官員。此後溥儀遷出紫禁城，謝介石與一些台人仍與之保持密切聯繫，所以筆者將之視為「勤王」的舉動。
另一個背景與陳寶琛、鄭孝胥這些和溥儀關係密切的福建人有關。台灣在清朝統治的大半時間（1684-1885）裡都屬福建省，因此閩台一家最自然不過。陳寶琛，福州人，前清進士，他曾任弼德院侍講，溥儀退位後，仍在身旁，在前述的復辟行動中，他被舉為內閣議政大臣，在滿洲國建國後，不顧其年邁（85 歲）隨溥儀進入滿洲。鄭孝胥則是國務院總理。據說在滿洲國中有不少福建人、台灣人經由這兩人引薦。
台灣人到滿洲另一個原因是出自滿洲國成立後，透過國務院直轄總務廳中的弘報部（宣傳部），不斷地宣稱滿洲是一個五族協和的王道樂土，將實行王道政治，因此當時去滿洲似為日本本土的流行，滿洲成了文人、報界謳歌的新天地，令人憧憬、嚮往。台灣人自己的《台灣民報》在滿洲國成立前的1930年1月開始報導〈馬賊と大豆粕及び張作霖で有名な滿洲〉（上）、（中）、（下），報導在滿洲的台灣醫生開業成功的例子。而滿洲建國後，日本對滿洲國的承認，有關滿洲的相關事情，台灣就有配合的活動進行，如「滿洲事變」後，台灣各地就舉行慰靈祭，對北滿的水災也捐了31萬5千圓85錢，還贈送了4,364個慰問袋給滿洲軍。這些機關行事不斷出現，就給了台灣人多認識滿洲的機會。
台灣人親自到滿洲採訪、報導集結成書，以現身說法的方式來介紹滿洲以及在滿洲的台灣人，可能收效更大。以黃竹堂的《新興滿洲國見聞記》為例，他不僅去拜訪謝介石、蔡法平等人，還特別有〈新京在任台灣關係者現勢〉一節，特別報導有台灣關係的台灣人和日本人，其中台灣人有19人。他雖因兒子急病而立刻踏上歸途，以至於沒有再往北，只到新京，但本書1933年出版時，仍有些商家在此登了贊助廣告，如稻江信用組合的郭廷俊，可見商家看好這本書的發行。
早期到滿洲的台灣人，尤其看板人物謝介石、蔡法平，還有成功的醫生，給了台灣人到滿洲的信心，尤其是1935年台灣始政四十周年記念博覽會召開時，謝介石以滿洲國第一任駐日大使的身分回台，接受台灣總督府的歡迎規格，讓台灣人看了興起「有為者亦若是」之感，之後赴滿洲者絡繹不絕，謝報就是一個重要的例子。而那年的10月27日是「滿洲日」，是博覽會場「滿洲館」的高潮。自10月10日博覽會開幕起，滿洲館就由滿洲國、關東州廳、滿鐵三個單位負責介紹新興滿洲的文化及主要特產，滿洲當地的日滿實業協會滿洲支部也招攬了幾梯次的觀光團到台灣來參觀，甚至滿洲國棒球隊也獲邀來參加與台灣、朝鮮的棒球邀請賽。1936年魏清德到滿洲、朝鮮一遊，分26次刊載〈滿鮮遊記〉於《台灣日日新報》（1936 年6 月2 日至7 月5 日），其中24日〈舊雨新雨〉，25日沿途訪舊都敘述到滿洲去所遇到的台人，當時正是同鄉謝介石任滿洲國駐日大使之際，外交部有不少台灣人任職。
這些發跡的台人認識滿洲，將滿洲視為新天地，仍需要有人介紹，謝介石用朱叔河（大甲朱麗之子）為秘書，並推薦黃子正、黃樹奎這一對堂兄弟，前者開業的大同醫院成為外交部特約醫院，後者以外交部顧問身分伴隨謝介石返台；黃清塗也曾求見謝，謝也介紹台灣人去見國務院總理鄭孝胥，如前提的黃竹堂、台灣第一位東京帝國大學醫學博士吳場、謝萬發、林紹裘等人。至於曾在台灣任職的日本／滿洲官員，亦有提攜之功，如原台灣總督府交通局遞信部長三宅福馬法制局長，任用楊蘭洲；原台灣銀行理事、滿洲中央銀行總裁的山成喬六、理事鈴木謙則、竹本節藏重用吳金川、高湯盤、蕭秀淮、許建裕等人。陳亭卿則受滿洲國民生部文教司長神尾弌春的推薦進入文教部，因為其師佐藤佐為神尾的同學。
台灣高等教育機關不足，到1928年才設台北帝國大學，且以教育日本人子弟為主，因而台灣人子弟要受高等教育非得遠渡重洋到日本、中國（包括滿洲）不可；而在薪水方面同工不同酬，在台灣的日本判任官加俸六成、高等官加俸五成，台灣人只有本薪；有時連工資也比日本人低，飽受差別待遇。同樣是大學畢業生，在台灣的出路也有限，因台灣內在的因素，也促成了台灣人前往滿洲國。
（二）滿洲國吸引台灣人的原因
由於滿洲國比日本本土大，要統治滿洲國、「保護」滿洲國，非有大量的日籍官員不可，這也是日本帝國內人才周流的原因之一。台灣人和朝鮮人屬於日系，但朝鮮人的待遇不如台灣人，尤其在配給方面，大同學院畢業、在滿洲國交通部任職的林永倉，之前在新京工業大學就讀時，五族學生都有，當時因統制經濟關係，配給公糧，滿、漢人配高粱，朝鮮人小米，台灣人則配給米。對台灣人沒有差別待遇是吸引台灣人的原因之一。在滿洲國的最高學府建國大學，不屬文教部而屬於國務院，設於1938年，這所學校每年給台灣三個名額（2%的錄取名額），截至滿洲國滅亡止，共有30名台灣學生入學，因修業期限六年，故至滿洲國走入歷史為止，畢業的人不多。
台灣人要進入這所大學，得先由學校推薦給總督，再經考試錄取。一旦進入建大，學費全免，畢業後經大同學院訓練，任試補高等官一年後，即可任高等官。除了建國大學外，台北、台南工業學校畢業生中想深造者，新京工業大學（原名新京鑛業技術學院）、哈爾濱工業大學、旅順工科大學都是最好的選擇；而除滿洲醫科大學，新京醫科大學、哈爾濱醫科大學、佳木斯醫科大學、盛京醫科大學外，還有為了開拓民而設的開拓醫學院，修業兩年，畢業後成為公醫。這些學校多少能滿足台灣學生的需要。其中特別一提的是，滿洲醫科大學畢業的台灣醫生有120多位，可見設在滿洲的各種學校對台灣人的吸引力。
在滿洲國待遇比在日本、台灣為高，不少台灣人都受此條件吸引，也很滿意當時的薪資，已如上述。在滿洲國還有津貼及各種費用，尤為去滿洲國者所津津樂道的：天寒要求多配衣服、棉被，甚至連鍋子、麵包、菸酒都有配給，生小孩則有配給牛奶，有時都喝不完，豐富的物質生活也是台灣人到滿洲的原因之一。
對學工科的人而言，在台灣就職的路子既窄，薪水又不高，因此台南工業學校的陳永祥，一畢業就到福岡報考滿洲國電信電話株式會社，因為台灣人在台灣很難進入台灣電力工作（有名額限制）；而當時在官廳的工資月薪60元、民間一般公司只有45元，但台灣人到滿洲國視同日本人，加七成津貼，到1945年，薪水調到158元，再加六成外地津貼，「這種收入以當時的生活水準算是很寬裕了。」考過滿洲國高等文官考試的謝報，說明當時同樣職務，薪水在滿洲國是日本的三倍，他在1943年參加適格、登格考試及格後給四級俸，月薪有420元。
滿洲的廣大、一望無際的平原、不同的風情，也是在島嶼成長的台灣人所夢寐以求的地方；再加上當地使用日語、北京話，不用說，受過教育的台灣人都懂日語，而台灣人大半懂漢文，有的在台灣已學會北京話，有的到滿洲後很快就學會，並考過語言考試而取得語言津貼，這比去南洋還有吸引力。
台灣人選擇去滿洲還有一個原因是，在戰爭後期日本物資缺乏，又有被美國空襲的危險，因而選擇到滿洲。林錦文、林黃素華夫妻因東京時有美機來轟炸，決定到滿洲國找在新京工科大學任教的叔父黃春木，乃參加開拓團，在1945年6、7月時才到滿洲，林錦文任軍醫，不久蘇軍就入侵滿洲。在日本京都帝國大學機械工程學科畢業（原學程三年，因戰爭提早半年畢業）的翁通楹，他說當時工科生在台灣、日本都很搶手，但日本船都會被美國擊沉，因此不敢回台，在日本又物資缺乏還有美軍轟炸的危險，乃應聘到龍江省鶴岡境內的炭礦公司，薪水一個月300多元，待遇很好，但因與興趣不合，乃轉到大陸科學院任職。
翁通楹的弟弟翁通逢畢業於日本東洋醫學專門學校，在日本醫科大學小兒科任職時，因日本東京時遭空襲，物資缺乏，心知已無法住在日本，又怕回台的船遭美船擊沉，當志願兵也有同樣危險，剛好有滿洲電信電話株式會社的朋友施其華由滿洲來東京，在其勸告下就到了滿洲，時為1944年，當時與他同行的還有楊希聯醫生。
雖然台灣人赴滿洲有許多利多的因素，滿洲也有吸引台灣人之處，但台灣人到滿洲也有其辛苦的一面。據筆者訪談過的人，他們的看法是，在宗教上，東北人似乎不像台灣人般信神，想燒香也沒有廟可以拜，因為當地沒人在過年拜拜，台灣人也就不敢拜或自己拜，有的人家則是在家裡拜；平時廟也關起來，連要燒的金紙也不同。不過信基督教的梁許春菊倒因住瀋陽時就在教會邊，因此在宗教、生活上受到很多照拂。由於滿洲距離台灣很遠，有人一到滿洲一直到戰後都沒有回過台灣，有的回來只是回來結婚；也有人是隻身在滿洲，因而缺少大家族有力的奧援，如在瀋陽維城中學（滿洲人的學校）任教的何金生，1938年到滿洲，1941年回台結婚，夫妻兩人同時在維城中學任教師，大女兒誕生後，要上課時只能將小孩放在家中，在上課時聽到小孩哭聲，下課跑回家看，才知女兒已噙著淚又睡著了。也有人在職中喪偶，或在職過世，如任滿洲國駐新義州副領事的吳左金，他的妻子因喝了鉛製水管受霍亂菌滲透的水而病逝，時年40歲；又曾任外交部歐美科政務司長的林景仁，是板橋林家林維源的長孫，1940年死於新京，由吳左金幫其安葬。至於在當地失去子女的也有。更有人殉職，如1932年6月1日就任國務院民政部屬官的王甲寅，敘委任三等，1933年陞委任一等，隔天即因公殉職。

台灣是個移民之島，住民先後來到台灣，隨著政權的轉移，歐洲殖民者、鄭氏王朝、清治、日治、國治時期，來來去去。台灣移民史歷年來很少成為貫時性的研究主題，若有也只是依不同的統治者所制定的移民制度做斷代性的論述，大都偏向當時的移入、定住的相關法規。對於台灣人的移出，則到近一、二十年來才開始有研究成果，也克服語言的多樣性。
本書以論文集方式呈現，共收入十篇論文，荷治、清領各一篇，主要探討人口數問題。日治時期三篇，一篇討論台東廳下的私營農業移民，得以窺見日本移民的一般，另兩篇則討論日治時期有南洋和滿洲國經驗的台灣人，都是最近五年內的研究成果，也是過去少有的研究領域，這兩篇論文不約而同使用口述歷史資料。

""The History of Taiwan's History Immigration"": Why did Taiwanese find their way to the cold Manchuria?
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that the treatment in Manchuria is higher than in Japan and Taiwan. Many Taiwanese are attracted by this condition and are very satisfied with the salary at that time. Another reason why Taiwanese choose to go to Manchuria is that in the latter part of the war, Japan lacked supplies and was in danger of being attacked by the United States, so they chose to go to Manchuria.



Text: Xu Xueji
[Taiwanese civil servants in the Manchurian government (1932-1945)]
(previously omitted)
Third, the background of Taiwanese to Manchuria
Why do Taiwanese find their way to the cold Manchuria country? What are the main reasons? In which departments are the Taiwanese in the Central Government of Manchuria? Who is a senior official (special, simple, recommended)?
(1) Reasons for Taiwanese to Manchuria
The main reason why Taiwanese went to Manchuria was that in the article of Taiwanese people under the Manchuria and Wang Jingwei regimes, the author proposed four common reasons, one is to study, the other is job hunting, the third is to do business, and the fourth is to resist Japan. Human rule, but the background to Manchuria is more complicated. First, Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895. At that time, it was under the rule of the Qing Dynasty. The ruling party of Manchuria and the emperor was a funeral. For the Taiwanese, it was the ruler of the former Qing, and there was much thought of the ""home country"" in Manchuria. In his poem ""Manchu State Founded with Fu"", Xie Tao said that Manchuria was ""the Han people are not full of anger and happiness"", saying that Manchuria's rule is ""the Huns have a big single today""; another poem ""Manchuria's imperial system is governed by Pu Yi. In the poem, I said: ""In the poem of the old country, the country is still ruling and ruling the king."" In the poem ""The Manchurian Diplomatic General and the Emperor Zong Jieshi Jun"", he praised Xie, who is the part of the Qing Dynasty. A spot. At the time of the establishment of Manchuria, the special minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xie Jieshi, participated in the funeral restoration operation of Zhang Xun and others on July 1, 1917. He was also appointed as the former enemy commander and served as a 12-day foreign ministry official. Since then, Pu Yi moved out of the Forbidden City. Xie Jieshi and some Taiwanese still maintain close contact with each other, so the author regards it as a ""diligent king"".
Another background is related to Chen Baozhen and Zheng Xiaoyu, who are closely related to Puyi. Taiwan was in Fujian Province during most of the Qing Dynasty's reign (1684-1885), so it is most natural for Fujian and Taiwan. Chen Baozhen, Fuzhou native, former Qing Jinshi, he served as a lecturer at the Jude Academy. After Pu Yi’s abdication, he was still beside him. In the aforementioned restoration operation, he was elected as the cabinet minister, after the establishment of Manchuria, regardless of his age ( 85 years old) Entering Manchuria with Puyi. Zheng Xiaoxuan is the Premier of the State Council. It is said that many people in Fujian and Taiwanese in Manchuria are recommended by these two people.
Another reason for Taiwanese to go to Manchuria is that after the establishment of Manchuria, through the Ministry of Public Affairs of the State Council’s General Affairs Office (the Propaganda Department), it is continually declared that Manchuria is a kingdom of the Five-nation Concord, and will implement the kingdom politics, so it went to Manchuria. Like the popularity of Japan, Manchuria has become a new world for literati and yangko in the press. It is embarrassing and yearning. The Taiwanese people’s own ""Taiwanese People's Daily"" began to report in January 1930, before the establishment of Manchuria, ""Marouchi, Soybean, and Zhang Zuolin, famous in Manchuria"" (above), (middle), and (below), reported in Taiwan in Manchuria. An example of a successful doctor opening. After Manchuria’s founding of the People’s Republic of China, Japan’s recognition of Manchuria and related activities in Manchuria have been carried out in Taiwan. For example, after the Manchurian Incident, a consolation festival was held in various parts of Taiwan, and a donation was also made to the floods in the North Manchuria. Forty thousand rounds of 85 money, and also gave 4,364 condolence bags to Manchurian Army. The constant emergence of these organs has given Taiwanese people a chance to know more about Manchuria.
Taiwanese personally went to Manchuria to interview and report to a book, and to introduce Manchuria and Taiwanese in Manchuria in a way that is more effective. Take Huang Zhutang's ""Emerging Manchurian Country News"" as an example. He not only visits Xie Jieshi and Cai Faping, but also has a section on ""The current situation of the new Beijing-based Taiwan relations,"" especially reporting Taiwanese and Japanese with Taiwan relations. Among them, there are 19 people in Taiwan. Although he was on the way home because of his son's sudden illness, he did not go further north, only to Xinjing, but when the book was published in 1933, some merchants still sponsored advertisements here, such as Guo Tingjun of the Dajiang credit portfolio. I am optimistic about the release of this book.
Taiwanese in early Manchuria, especially the kanban figures Xie Jieshi, Cai Faping, and successful doctors, gave Taiwanese people the confidence to go to Manchuria, especially when the 1935 Taiwan’s 40th Anniversary Commemorative Exposition was held, Xie Jieshi was the first in Manchuria. The identity of the ambassador to Japan returned to Taiwan and accepted the welcome specifications of the Governor's Office of Taiwan. This made the Taiwanese people feel the sensation of ""there are people who are also convinced"". Afterwards, they went to Manchuria to continue their enthusiasm. The Xie Bao is an important example. On October 27 of that year, it was ""Manchu Day"", which was the climax of the ""Manchu Pavilion"" at the fair. Since the opening of the Expo on October 10, Manchuria, Kanto Prefecture Hall and Manchuria have been responsible for introducing the culture and major specialties of Xinmanchu, and the Manchurian branch of Manchuria’s local Manchu Industrial Association has also recruited several steps. The tour group came to Taiwan to visit, and even the Manchuria baseball team was invited to participate in the baseball tournament with Taiwan and North Korea. In 1936, Wei Qingde went to Manchuria and North Korea for a tour, and published 26 full-time travel notes on ""Taiwan Daily News"" (June 2 to July 5, 1936), including 24th ""Old Rain and New Rain"", 25 On the day-to-day visit, the old people described the Taiwanese people who met in Manchuria. At the time, when Xie Jieshi, the fellow countryman, was the ambassador of Manchuria to Japan, there were many Taiwanese in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
These Taiwanese who have made a fortune know Manchuria and regard Manchuria as a new world. Some people still need to introduce it. Xie Jieshi uses Zhu Shuhe (the son of Dajia Juli) as the secretary, and recommends Huang Zizheng and Huang Shukui as cousins. The former Datong Hospital has become diplomatic. The special hospital, the latter was accompanied by Xie Jieshi as a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Huang Qingtu also asked to thank Xie, Xie also introduced Taiwanese to see Premier Zheng Xiaoyu, such as Huang Zhutang of the premise, and the first doctor of medical science at Tokyo Imperial University in Taiwan Field, Xie Wanfa, Lin Shaozhen and others. As for the Japanese/Manchurian officials who have served in Taiwan, they also have the merits of supporting them. For example, the former Minister of Communications of the Governor’s Office of the Ministry of Transportation, Miyake Fuma, the legal director, and the appointment of Yang Lanzhou; the former director of the Bank of Taiwan and the president of Manchuria Central Bank Director Suzuki Kenzo and Takemoto Festival use Wu Jinchuan, Gaotang Pan, Xiao Xiuhuai, Xu Jianyu and others. Chen Tingqing was admitted to the Ministry of Culture and Education by the recommendation of the Director of Culture and Education of Manchuria, the Ministry of Culture and Education of the Manchurian Ministry, because his teacher Sato Sato was a student of Shenwei.
Taiwan’s higher education institutions were not enough. It was only in 1928 that the Taipei Imperial University was established, and the Japanese children were mainly educated. Therefore, Taiwanese children must be educated in higher education to travel to Japan and China (including Manchuria). Workers pay different wages. In Taiwan, Japan’s officials are crowned 60%, and high-ranking officials are 50%. Taiwanese have only a salary; sometimes they are even lower than Japanese, and they are treated differently. The same is a college graduate. The way out in Taiwan is also limited. Because of Taiwan’s internal factors, Taiwan’s people have also traveled to Manchuria.
(2) Reasons for Manchuria to attract Taiwanese
Since Manchuria is larger than Japan, it is necessary to rule Manchuria and ""protect"" Manchuria. There is not a large number of Japanese officials. This is one of the reasons for the talent flow in the Japanese Empire. Taiwanese and Koreans belong to the Japanese, but the Koreans are not treated as well as Taiwanese, especially in the case of rations. Lin Yongcang, who graduated from Datong College and worked in the Manchuria Ministry of Communications, used to study at Xinjing University of Technology. At that time, due to the control of economic relations, the distribution of grain, the Manchu, the Han people with sorghum, the Koreans Xiaomi, the Taiwanese were given rice. There is no difference in treatment for Taiwanese people is one of the reasons for attracting Taiwanese. Jianguo University, the highest institution in Manchuria, belongs to the State Council not belonging to the Ministry of Culture and Education. It was established in 1938. This school gives Taiwan three places each year (2% of places accepted). As of the end of Manchuria, there are 30 Taiwanese students. Admission to school, due to the six-year period of study, so Manchuria has entered history, and there are not many graduates.
To enter this university, Taiwanese must first be recommended by the school to the Governor and then admitted to the examination. Once you enter Jianda, the tuition is free. After graduation, you will be trained by Datong College. In addition to Jianguo University, graduates from Taipei and Tainan Industrial School want to pursue further studies. Xinjing University of Technology (formerly known as Xinjing Mining Technology College), Harbin Institute of Technology, and Lushun University of Technology are the best choices; except Manchuria Medical University, Outside the Beijing University of Medical Sciences, Harbin Medical University, Jiamusi Medical University, and Shengjing Medical University, there are also medical schools for the development of the people. They have been practicing for two years and become public doctors after graduation. How many schools can meet the needs of Taiwanese students. In particular, there are more than 120 Taiwanese doctors who graduated from Manchuria Medical University, showing the attraction of Taiwanese people in various schools in Manchuria.
The treatment in Manchuria is higher than in Japan and Taiwan. Many Taiwanese are attracted by this condition and are very satisfied with the salary at that time. There are also allowances and various expenses in Manchuria, especially to the Manchurians. The weather requires more clothes, quilts, even pots, bread, tobacco and alcohol, and children with milk. Sometimes it is not enough to drink, and the rich material life is one of the reasons why Taiwanese go to Manchuria.
For those who study in engineering, the road to employment in Taiwan is narrow and the salary is not high. Therefore, Chen Yongxiang of Tainan Industrial School went to Fukuoka to apply for Manchuria Telecom Telephone Co., Ltd. because he was difficult to enter Taiwan in Taiwan. Electricity work (limited quota); at that time, the monthly salary of the official hall was 60 yuan, and the civil general company was only 45 yuan, but the Taiwanese went to Manchuria to see the Japanese, plus 70% of the allowance. By 1945, the salary was adjusted to 158 yuan. And add 60% of the foreign subsidy. ""This kind of income is very generous in terms of living standards at that time."" After the examination of the Manchu State Higher Civil Service Examination, the same position, the salary was three times that of Japan in Manchuria. In 1943, after attending the Qualifying and Passing Pass exam, he gave the fourth grade, and the monthly salary was 420 yuan.
The vast, endless plains and different customs of Manchuria are also the places that Taiwanese who grew up on the island dreamed of; plus local Japanese and Beijing dialects, needless to say, educated Taiwanese know Japanese, and most of Taiwanese I understand Chinese, some have learned Beijing in Taiwan, some have learned quickly after going to Manchuria, and have taken language exams to get language allowances, which is more attractive than going to Nanyang.
Another reason why Taiwanese choose to go to Manchuria is that in the latter part of the war, Japan lacked supplies and was in danger of being attacked by the United States, so they chose to go to Manchuria. Lin Jinwen and Lin Huang Suhua’s husband and wife were bombed by a US plane in Tokyo. They decided to go to Manchuria to find Huang Chunmu, the uncle who taught at Xinjing University of Technology. He joined the pioneering group and went to Manchuria in June and July of 1945. Lin Jinwen was a military doctor. Soon the Soviets invaded Manchuria. Weng Tongyu, who graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Kyoto Imperial University in Japan (the original three-year course, graduated half a year earlier due to the war), said that engineering students were very popular in Taiwan and Japan, but Japanese ships were sunk by the United States. I dare not return to Taiwan. In Japan, there is a shortage of materials and the danger of bombing by the US military. I am applying to the carbon mining company in Hegang, Longjiang Province. The salary is more than 300 yuan a month, and the treatment is very good. However, due to disagreement with the interest, I transferred to the mainland Academy of Sciences. Serve.
Weng Tongyu’s younger brother, Tong Tongfeng, graduated from the Toyo Medical College in Japan. When he was employed in the Pediatrics of Japan Medical University, he was attacked by Tokyo in Japan. He lacked supplies, and he knew that he could not live in Japan. Sinking, when the volunteers were equally dangerous, just a friend of Manchuria Telecom Telephone Co., Ltd. Shi Qihua came to Tokyo from Manchuria, and in his advice, he went to Manchuria in 1944, when he was accompanied by Dr. Yang Xilian.
Although Taiwanese have many bullish factors in Manchuria, Manchuria also attracts Taiwanese, but Taiwanese have a hard side in Manchuria. According to the authors interviewed by the author, their view is that, in terms of religion, the Northeasters do not seem to believe in God like Taiwanese. They want to burn incense and there is no temple to worship. Because no one in the country worships the New Year, Taiwanese will not dare to worship. Or worship by yourself, some people worship at home; usually the temple is closed, and even the gold paper to be burned is different. However, Liang Xuchunju, who believes in Christianity, was on the side of the church when he lived in Shenyang. Therefore, he received a lot of attention in religion and life. Since Manchuria is far away from Taiwan, some people have not returned to Taiwan since the end of the war, and some have just returned to get married. Some people are only in Manchuria, so they lack the strong family support, such as the Shenyang Weicheng Middle School. He Jinsheng, a teacher at Manchurian School, went to Manchuria in 1938 and returned to Taiwan in 1941. Both husband and wife were teachers at Weicheng Middle School. After the birth of the eldest daughter, only the children could be placed at home during class. Hearing the cry of the child, he ran home after class and saw that his daughter had fallen asleep and fell asleep. Some people were widowed in their jobs, or died in office. For example, Wu Zuojin, who is the deputy consul of Manchuria in Xinyi Prefecture, died of drinking water from a lead-water pipe that was infiltrated by cholera bacteria. He was 40 years old and served as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lin Jingren, director of the European and American Department of Political Affairs, is the grandson of Banqiao Lin Jialin Weiyuan. He died in Xinjing in 1940 and was buried by Wu Zuojin. As for the loss of children in the local area. Some people have lost their jobs. For example, on June 1, 1932, he was appointed as the official of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the State Council, Wang Jiaxuan, and he was appointed to the third class. In 1933, he was promoted to the first class.

Taiwan is an island of immigrants. The inhabitants have come to Taiwan. With the transfer of power, the European colonists, the Zheng dynasty, the Qing dynasty, the Japanese rule, and the national rule came and went. The history of Taiwanese immigrants has rarely become a topic of research in the past years. If there is only a discussion of the immigration system formulated by different rulers, most of them are biased towards the relevant laws and regulations for immigration and settlement. For the removal of Taiwanese, it has only begun to have research results in the past one or two decades, and it has also overcome the diversity of language.
This book is presented in the form of a collection of papers. It has a total of ten papers, one from the Zhizhi and the Qing Dynasty. It mainly discusses the population problem. Three articles in the Japanese occupation period, one discussing the private agricultural immigrants under the Taitung Hall, can glimpse the generality of Japanese immigrants, and the other two discuss the Taiwanese who have experience in Nanyang and Manchuria during the Japanese occupation period. The results are also rare in the past, and the two papers use the oral history.
