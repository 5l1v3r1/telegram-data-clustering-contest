Gay Bryne, veteran broadcaster and original host of the Late Late Show, has died at the age of 85.
The respected RTÉ figure had been ill for some time after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and he died at home today.
In a statement, his family said: ""It is with sadness that Kathleen, Crona and Suzy wish to announce that their beloved Gay has died peacefully at home today, surrounded by his family.
""We wish to thank everybody for their love and support during Gay's illness. Particularly the wonderful teams in the Mater Hospital, St Francis Hospice and the Irish Cancer Society"".
President Michael D Higgins has paid tribute to the ""legendary broadcaster"".
""A man of great charisma, Gay Byrne was someone who exuded warmth and presence, who was possessed of effortless wit, charm and who had a flair for broadcasting. This was combined with an innate gentleness as a person, professionalism and humour.
""Through his work in radio and on television he challenged Irish society, and shone a light not only on the bright but also the dark sides of Irish life. In doing so, he became one of the most familiar and distinctive voices of our times, helping shape our conscience, our self-image, and our idea of who we might be.  
""Beyond compassion, which he had in abundance, he had a sense of what was just."" 



RTÉ Director-General Dee Forbes said ""Ireland grew up under Gay Byrne and we will never see his like again"". 
""Gay’s journalistic legacy is as colossal as the man himself – he not only defined generations, but he deftly arbitrated the growth and development of a nation.""

Ryan Tubridy is the current host of The Late Late Show and has paid tribute to Mr Byrne.
""It is with enormous and profound sadness that I heard of the passing of my friend and mentor, Gay Byrne,"" he added.
""He was the master, a once off and the likes of which we will never see again.
""I watched him as a child, worked alongside him as a young man and he guided me as I grew older and I will forever be indebted to him.
""We in RTÉ have lost a friend, a family have lost a father and a husband and the country has lost an icon.""
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Gay Byrne was ""the most influential broadcaster in the history of the State"".
""A consummate entertainer, he also provided a voice for all those who had been silenced or were afraid to speak up, and he forced us to confront things that needed to be challenged in our society,"" he added. 
Lord Mayor of Dublin Paul Mc Auliffe will open a Book of Condolence at 11am tomorrow in The Mansion House.
In January Gay Byrne spoke of his desire to return to work and the toll cancer treatment had taken on his health.
""Ideally, I would like to get back to doing my Sunday afternoon radio show on Lyric FM, but my wife and daughters tell me I'm not ready and won't let me do it,"" he told Ireland's Own.
The former Late Late Show presenter had been off the airwaves for more than two years at that point.. 
Gay Byrne was born on August 5 1934 and grew up in Dublin. He started work as a newsreader and continuity announcer on Radio Éireann in the late 1950s before moving to Granada Television in Manchester, where he worked on a variety of shows, interviewing acts including The Beatles.
For a time he commuted between Dublin and Britain, working for both the BBC and RTÉ, but returned permanently in the 1960s when he took the healm on The Late Late Show which is the world’s longest running chat show. He left the show in 1999 and is remembered for a number of notable interviews, including a conversation with Annie Murphy who had had a relationship and son with Bishop Eamonn Casey. 
Secretary of State Peter Brooke offered to resign after singing My Darling Clementine on The Late Late Show hours after eight men were killed by an IRA bomb at Teebane in Co Tyrone in January 1992.

 Séamus Dooley, Irish Secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said Mr Byrne was ""the father of public service broadcasting in Ireland"".
""A broadcaster of courage, vison and boundless energy Gay Byrne helped shape modern Ireland and used his talents to help create a more caring, compassionate and inclusive society.
""He was often infuriating, annoying and provocative but Gay was never dull and in his career he brought light, laughter and humanity to television and radio debates.""
