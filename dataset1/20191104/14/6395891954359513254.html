      <p><b>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.Â (AP)</b> - Boeing's crew capsule is back on land after a brief flight to test its launch abort system.</p>
      <p>The Starliner capsule carried no astronauts Monday morning, just a test dummy.</p>
      <p>Boeing plans to launch the Starliner to the International Space Station next month, without a crew. The abort system will provide a fast getaway for the three astronauts if there's an emergency on the Florida pad or in flight.</p>
      <p>During Monday's test, Boeing counted down to zero, then the Starliner's launch abort engines fired. The capsule soared nearly a mile (1,300 meters), then parachuted back into the New Mexico desert. The entire flight lasted one-and-a-half minutes.</p>
      <p>Only two of the three main parachutes deployed, but NASA said astronauts would have been safe if aboard.</p>
      <p>Next up is an orbital test flight.</p>
