《秘魯史》：印加文明號稱「黃金國度」，但交易竟然不使用貨幣
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是印加社會中，既不存在發達的商業，也沒有商人和商店。之所以商業落後、貨幣缺乏，許多學者將之歸咎於印加實行「計畫經濟」。



文：何國世
土地是印加經濟繁榮的基礎，個人是沒有私人土地的。田地一則屬於教士作為崇拜太陽神之用，另外則屬於印加人作為維持皇族和政府運作，或是屬於部族和村社來分配給各家庭。土地在個人間不能買賣，但在人數變動時，仍會作適時的調整。
印加社會對農業耕種規範了一定的秩序：村社的人民首先耕作皇族的土地，然後耕作村社中鰥寡、孤獨、癱瘓者的土地，最後才耕種村社所擁有的土地。士兵家眷的土地也與此相似，在村莊中被歸於寡婦之列，由眾人代為耕種。耕作時由村社長老率領，彼此相互幫助，很像1950或1960年代臺灣農村鄰里間相互幫工的型態。（註）此外，土地上所生產的作物，全部歸入公共倉庫再重行分配。
隨著農業、畜牧業的發展，印加民間產生了「大地之母」的信仰。而印加的大地之母「帕查瑪瑪」（Pachamama），至今仍被很多印第安部落信奉。此外，在印加文化的影響下，印加帝國境內普遍信仰的太陽神也被視為是農業文明的共有神明形象。印加人認為太陽神透過祂的光芒，使得祂的妻子「帕查瑪瑪」孕育果實。被太陽照耀的大地變得肥沃、富饒，獲得豐收的能力。印加人耕種的全部過程，處處與宗教密不可分。
印加王在每年播種前，以太陽神之子的身分，舉行神聖的首耕儀式。他用一把金質木橛挖開土地，然後親手播下種子，代表民眾向太陽神父親祈求往後一年全國所有的農業活動都能得到護佑。此外，印加人馴養了駱馬、羊駝，但還不懂得使用耕畜，農耕活動完全靠人力完成。而且安地斯高原也非萬頃良田，在砂石地中，只有當地特產的木橛才能發揮最大功效。這種木橛很像傳說中印加第一代國王曼科・卡帕克所持的金手杖，也因此印加人對這項工具特別依戀。
秘魯印第安人早在西元前4000多年就開始種植玉米、南瓜、菜豆等。西元前3000年學會種植棉花。到印加帝國時期，農業已獲得相當發展，栽培的農作物多達四十多種，包括馬鈴薯、玉米、南瓜等，其中有許多作物是當時別的地區所沒有的。印加人在安地斯山的河谷和山坡地，闢建梯田以防止水土流失。此外，印加人也修建了精巧複雜的灌溉系統，加上知道使用鳥糞作肥料，所以農業蓬勃發展，馬鈴薯和玉米的產量尤為豐富。
眾所皆知，印加以盛產黃金聞名。但是，奇怪的是，在這個黃金國度，竟然沒有物品交換的媒介——貨幣。印加社會中，既不存在發達的商業，也沒有商人和商店。之所以商業落後、貨幣缺乏，許多學者將之歸咎於印加實行「計畫經濟」。印加的手工業，等級高者全部集中在首都庫斯科，他們並非完全屈從於政治的調遣，而是在印加社會中，只有貴族才能擁有奢侈品和享受品。一般百姓由國家保障溫飽的生活，似乎也無需與基本生存無關的奢侈用品。在這種情況下，工匠們生產的高級用品直接上繳國家，宮廷則發放食品，供養工匠，也因此便無需貨幣仲介。此外，印加社會對金銀的態度顯得與眾不同。印加人並不把金銀看作是財產或珍寶，人們對金銀的喜好，更多是出於對裝飾品的熱衷。所以印加人用大量的金銀來裝飾王宮、太陽神廟和貞女宮等。
儘管整個印加社會在「計畫經濟」作用下按需分配，運行良好，使得商業行為顯得多餘，但是在印加社會中，對平常百姓而言，物物交換也是獲得自己需要或喜愛東西的重要方式。山區居民將其特產，如毛皮、畜肉、金銀及各種用具、器皿等，定期地與沿海地區居民所出產的蔬果、棉花、鳥糞等進行物品交換，是印加社會中最為重要的「貿易」，類似今天的市集。為了順應交易的需求，在交換中就很自然的產生類似貨幣的媒介。因此，人們把鹽巴、辣椒、毛皮、礦石和金屬製品，當作交換的等值物。然而，印加的以物易物交換和貿易還是相當落後，因為沒有全國統一的度量衡。商業活動的真正興起，是在西班牙殖民統治時代的事。至於對外貿易，研究者推測，古印加人與商業發達的阿茲特克人之間可能存在海路貿易。但是，印加與別國的貿易只是處於開始階段。
宗教、生活與風俗習慣
像所有印第安人一樣，印加人信仰多神教。他們認為神靈無所不在。在太陽神、月神、地神、雷神、雨神等諸神中，印加人特別崇拜太陽神印蒂，自稱是太陽的兒女。在庫斯科和全國各地都建造了巨大的太陽神廟，在廟中供奉著裝飾金色的太陽神像，庫斯科的太陽神廟是最大的祭拜中心。此外，印加族的祖先被認為起源於太陽，印加王更是太陽的子孫。
據說，太陽神把金犁和種子賜給了人們，為了感謝太陽神的恩賜，印加人除了修建朝拜的廟宇外，還經年累月的舉行太陽祭。秘魯的印第安人在每年6月24日於庫斯科城舉行盛大的太陽祭。因為印加帝國曆法精確，新年是從6月21日也就是南半球的冬至開始。後來人們就把6月24日作為祭祀太陽的日子，稱為太陽祭。在這一天，太陽的子孫們以莊嚴隆重的儀式來揮別舊歲，迎接新一年的來臨。為了使太陽神廟的聖火不滅，印加王特別派遣大量的祭司和太陽貞女加以護持，也因此一直保持祈禱、獻祭等名目繁多的宗教儀式。
印加人也把雷神看成重要的神。雷神能降雨，常被描繪成手持投石器和狼牙棒的武士。月亮神是太陽神之妻。星神則是保護羊駝及其他動物的神靈。另外，印加人也沿襲前印加時期崇拜圖騰的習俗，常用各種動植物名稱來命名自己的部落或氏族。印加人也崇拜玉米神、馬鈴薯神與氏族祖先。
在印加人的信仰中，死去的人永遠不會離開活人的世界，他只不過是轉化成另一種狀態活著，所以印加人製作木乃伊，正是為了保持和延續對死者的崇敬。穿著盛裝、佩帶首飾，旁邊放有日常用品和食物的木乃伊，大都埋葬在用岩石鑿成的墳墓中。印加人對統治者的木乃伊崇拜，表現得最為虔誠。印加每逢盛大節慶時，他們就將這些木乃伊抬出來遊行。作戰時，他們也攜帶木乃伊出征，他們相信這些木乃伊有超乎自然的神力，可以保佑他們，讓他們逢凶化吉，取得戰爭的勝利。印第安人還認為，如果祖先的遺骸—木乃伊，一旦被毀壞，活著的人就失去擁有土地的權利，而在安地斯山嚴酷、惡劣的環境中，失去土地也意味著死亡。此外，在古印加人信念中，如果祖先動怒的話，活人就註定會生病、倒楣，甚至死亡。他們深信，死人控制著大自然的力量，從而決定活人的生死。
無生命的人控制著活人的命運，木乃伊的權勢也就是活著的人的權勢。古印加人把對木乃伊、祖先和太陽神的崇拜融合在一起，也因此創造了人類文化史上這種獨一無二的奇特現象。
為了讓人口不斷成長，殺嬰及通姦在印加社會須受嚴厲的懲罰；婚姻是一種義務，娼妓幾乎不存在。印加青年男女發生戀情受到血統及地域的雙重限制。印加社會不同階級之間的通婚只對男性優惠，也就是貴族男性可以娶普通百姓的女兒。女子高攀被人羨慕，但如果下嫁，就自動降了階級，為人所不齒。另外，所有印加人必須在自己所屬社區內選擇配偶，婚姻對象局限於家族、親屬內部，不允許不同省分、村社間相互通婚。再者，婚姻還必須符合年齡上的要求，即女方達十八到二十歲，男方年滿二十四歲，表示該擔負家庭責任的時候到了。最後，還要徵得父母同意。印加帝國規定，不經父母承認的婚姻無效。
印加人的婚禮，每隔一年或兩年，在一個特定的日子，在全國各地同時舉行，由印加王親自主持，有人戲稱這是世界上規模最大的集體結婚。印加人將妻子視作是印加王的恩賜，將婚姻看作是國王的恩寵和自己的榮耀，再次印證印加推行的家父長制已深植人心。總之，在印加社會中，婚禮似乎只能順著父母的意思，子女毫無個人自由的選擇。印加人有試婚的習俗，如果共同生活一段時間發現不合，男女雙方可各自回到父母家裡，如果已有小孩，則小孩跟媽媽。對印加人而言，婚姻是一種義務，因此若有人沒有女朋友，官方會幫他選派一位。在印加社會也有買妻的現象；通姦須處死刑。一夫多妻只盛行於印加王及其他高官之間。
印加婦女須自己接生，而且生產後不久即須做家事；生雙胞胎或畸形兒被視為不祥。而且，婦女墮胎是一件不幸的事，若想再孕必須先經巫師解咒。此外，紡紗及家事是婦女的主要工作，她們也必須陪著先生出征。所有的印加婦女都受法律保障，丈夫不能對她們施暴或辱罵。
印加嬰兒剛一出世，不管出生時天氣有多麼寒冷，都必須用一盆冷冰冰的水洗澡。往後，冷水澡是嬰兒每天早晨睡醒後的第一門「功課」。印加父母認為，給孩子洗冷水澡是為使孩子體格強壯，能抵禦嚴寒。而且印加父母更看中的是，冷水澡能培養下一代吃苦耐勞。
在印加社會餵食小孩一天不超過三次。印加人認為這是取法於自然，動物就是按一定的時辰給幼獸哺乳，而不是沒節制的整天餵食。他們還認為如果小孩一旦習慣叼著奶吃，就容易上吐下瀉，長大後更會變成好吃貪嘴的傢伙。所以除掉規定的三個時間，即使孩子哇哇大哭，母親也不會以餵奶的方式安撫他。此外，大部分的時間印加小孩都單獨在搖籃裡，甚至在餵奶時，印加婦女也從不會將小孩抱在懷裡。印加人認為這是讓孩子在吃奶的同時也練習為生存而主動進食，更能讓孩子早點學習自立，同時也讓父母有更多時間為生計打拼。嬰兒滿兩周歲，生活有大的變化。首先，從這天起，母親不再給孩子餵奶，沒有以飯食逐漸取代奶水的過渡措施，而是突然斷奶，改吃飯菜食品。其次，也在這一天為小孩子進行剃頭，印加人認為這是讓小孩「改頭換面」，從此具備文明人的形象。
在日常生活方面，印加貴族日食三餐，一般民眾只有早午餐。婦女通常背對著先生用餐，且在餐畢前不准喝東西。他們通常兩天沐浴一次，不過避免在上、下弦月的日子，因為他們認為在這些日子沐浴，易遭疾病附身。
印加的法律對貴族比一般大眾寬容。死刑是常見的處罰。另外，有時也會將罪犯與猛獸關在一起。孩子犯罪，父親同受處罰，但是父母犯罪，罪不及子女。不小心燒毀房子必須負責重建。偷窺須接受懲罰，但若因三餐不濟偷東西，官員須提供罪犯食物。
印加人視大耳朵為美麗、高貴，印加貴族的醒目標誌是他們幾乎人人有一副令人觸目驚心的大耳。這樣的大耳朵並不是得自天然，完全是人工雕飾，意志努力的結果。印加貴族男子在成年禮儀式上，用金子做的針在耳朵上穿一個很大的孔，佩帶巨大的金耳環，久而久之便成為大耳朵。此外，印加人認為剪髮是文明人的標誌，只有野蠻人才鬚髮蓬亂。
總之，在西班牙殖民者到達美洲之前，印第安人已建立起自己獨特的文化。這個文化與舊大陸各古代文化有些不同。首先，舊大陸的古代文化都發源於大河流域，但是美洲新大陸文化的發源地卻是在盆地，如阿茲特克文化發源於墨西哥盆地，南美的印加文化起源於庫斯科盆地。其次，舊大陸居民的主食是麥類和水稻，而印第安人主要依靠玉米，所以又稱「玉米文化」。再者，印第安人雖然不知道使用馬、鐵、犁和車輛，但今天人類生活的許多物品，如馬鈴薯、玉米、番茄、菸草、可可、火雞、羊駝和家畜、家禽等，都是由印第安人首先培植、提供而後傳到歐洲及世界各地，豐富了人類的物質和經濟生活，為人類文化帶來很大的貢獻。
註：印加帝國把鄰里互助當成一項法律，稱為「兄弟互助法」，規定同村村民間友愛互助，互相幫忙完成耕種、收穫，或無法獨立完成的建築等活動。這種互相幫助、互相支持的模式，使得每個人都能夠愉快的完成繁重的工作。

秘魯，這個孕育古印加帝國的國度，充滿著謎樣的氣息！
自遠古時期，秘魯因有安地斯山南北縱貫，地形險阻，但文明早已在此深根發展。十五世紀後，印加人在此建立了高度且燦爛的印加文明，他們崇拜太陽神、喜好收藏象徵太陽光芒的黃金，並以「太陽的子民」自居。然「黃金國」的傳說卻在十六世紀西班牙人登陸南美洲後，轉瞬間成為滅亡帝國的導火線。
西班牙人殖民秘魯長達三百多年，對秘魯的政治社會與文化風俗留下深刻的影響，致使十八世紀後已然獨立的秘魯，仍擺脫不了獨裁政治的控制。而今，政治貪汙腐敗、經濟產業衰退、國際紛爭不斷，祕魯該如何突破難關，就讓我們拭目以待。
本書將為你娓娓訴說秘魯的神話傳說、飲食文化、人文風情，同時也細數印加文明、西班牙殖民時期以及秘魯獨立建國以來，所歷經的政治、社會、經濟各方面的問題，帶你一窺秘魯的真實面貌。

""The History of Peru"": The Inca civilization is known as the ""Golden Kingdom"", but the transaction does not use the currency.
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that there is neither developed business nor merchants or shops in Inca society. The reason why the business is backward and the currency is lacking is that many scholars blame it on the implementation of the “planning economy” in Inca.



Text: He Guoshi
Land is the foundation of the Inca economic boom, and individuals have no private land. One field belongs to the priest as the worship of the sun god, and the other belongs to the Incas as the maintenance of the royal family and the government, or belong to the tribes and villages to distribute to the families. Land cannot be bought or sold between individuals, but when the number of people changes, it will still be adjusted in a timely manner.
The Inca society has regulated a certain order for agricultural farming: the people of the village community first cultivated the land of the royal family, and then cultivated the land of widows, loneliness, and prostitutes in the village community, and finally cultivated the land owned by the village community. The land of the soldiers’ homes is similar. It is classified as a widow in the village and is cultivated by the people. When farming, they were led by the village elders and helped each other, much like the type of mutual help between rural neighbors in Taiwan in the 1950s or 1960s. (Note) In addition, all the crops produced on the land are classified into public warehouses and then redistributed.
With the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the Inca folks have developed the belief of ""the mother of the earth."" The mother of the land of Inca, Pachamama, is still believed by many Indian tribes. In addition, under the influence of Inca culture, the sun god, which is widely believed in the Inca Empire, is also regarded as the shared god image of agricultural civilization. The Incas believed that the sun god, through his light, made his wife, ""Pachamama,"" give birth to fruit. The earth that is illuminated by the sun becomes fertile, rich, and has the ability to harvest. The entire process of Inca farming is inseparable from religion.
Before the inoculation, King Inca held the sacred first ploughing ceremony as the son of the sun god. He dug the land with a gold raft, and then sowed the seeds by hand, praying to the sun god father on behalf of the people that all the agricultural activities in the country could be blessed in the following year. In addition, the Incas have domesticated llamas and alpacas, but they do not know how to use farm animals. Farming activities are completely done by manpower. Moreover, the Andes Plateau is not a vast expanse of land. In the sandstone area, only the local specialties of hibiscus can exert its maximum effect. This kind of raft is very similar to the golden cane held by the legendary Inca, the first king of Inca, and the Incas are particularly attached to this tool.
Peruvian Indians began planting corn, pumpkin, and kidney beans as early as 4,000 years before BC. Learn to grow cotton in 3000 BC. By the time of the Inca Empire, agriculture had developed considerably, with more than forty varieties of crops, including potatoes, corn, and pumpkins, many of which were not found in other regions at the time. The Incas built terraces in the valleys and hillsides of the Andes to prevent soil erosion. In addition, the Incas have also built sophisticated and complex irrigation systems, and know that the use of bird droppings as fertilizer, so agriculture is booming, and the production of potatoes and corn is particularly rich.
It is well known that India is famous for its rich gold. However, the strange thing is that in this golden country, there is no medium for exchange of goods - currency. In Inca society, there is neither developed business nor merchants and shops. The reason why the business is backward and the currency is lacking is that many scholars blame it on the implementation of the “planning economy” in Inca. Inca's handicraft industry, the highest ranks are concentrated in the capital of Cusco, they do not completely succumb to political assignments, but in the Inca society, only nobles can have luxury and enjoyment. Generally speaking, the people's life guaranteed by the state does not seem to require luxury goods that are not related to basic survival. In this case, the high-quality items produced by the craftsmen are directly turned over to the state, and the courts distribute foods to support the craftsmen, so there is no need for money intermediary. In addition, the Inca society’s attitude towards gold and silver is different. The Incas do not regard gold and silver as property or treasures. People's preference for gold and silver is more due to the enthusiasm for decorations. Therefore, the Incas used a lot of gold and silver to decorate the palace, the Temple of the Sun and the Palace of the Virgin.
Although the entire Inca society is allocated on demand and functioning well under the “planning economy”, making business behavior redundant, but in the Inca society, for ordinary people, bartering is also an important way to get what you need or love. . Mountain residents exchange their special products, such as fur, meat, gold and silver, and various utensils and utensils, regularly with fruits and vegetables, cotton, and bird droppings produced by residents in coastal areas. This is the most important ""trade"" in Inca society. Similar to today's market. In order to comply with the needs of the transaction, it is natural to generate a currency-like medium in the exchange. Therefore, people regard salt, pepper, fur, ore and metal products as equivalents of exchange. However, the exchange of barter and trade between Inca and India is still quite backward, because there is no nationally unified weights and measures. The real rise of business activities was in the era of Spanish colonial rule. As for foreign trade, the researchers speculate that there may be sea trade between the ancient Incas and the well-developed Aztecs. However, the trade between Inca and other countries is only at the beginning.
Religion, life and customs
Like all Indians, the Incas believe in polytheism. They think that the gods are omnipresent. Among the gods such as the sun god, the moon god, the earth god, the thunder god, the rain god, the Incas especially worship the sun god Inti, claiming to be the son of the sun. Huge temples of the sun have been built in Cusco and throughout the country, and the golden sun statues are enshrined in the temple, and the Sun Temple in Cusco is the largest worship center. In addition, the Inca ancestors were thought to have originated in the sun, and the Inca king was a descendant of the sun.
It is said that the sun god gave the golden plow and the seeds to the people. In order to thank the gods of the sun, the Incas, in addition to building the temple of worship, also held the sun festival for many years. Peruvian Indians hold a grand sun festival in Cusco on June 24th each year. Because the Inca Empire is accurate, the New Year begins on June 21st, the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere. Later, people used June 24 as the day of sacrificing the sun, called the sun festival. On this day, the descendants of the sun greeted the old age with a solemn and solemn ceremony to welcome the coming of the new year. In order to keep the sacred fire of the Temple of the Sun, the Inca king specially sent a large number of priests and sun prostitutes to protect them, and thus kept a variety of religious ceremonies such as prayers and sacrifices.
The Incas also regarded Raytheon as an important god. Raytheon can rain, often portrayed as a warrior holding a sling and a mace. The moon god is the wife of the sun god. Star God is the god that protects alpaca and other animals. In addition, the Incas also followed the custom of worshipping totems in the pre-Incan period, and used various names of animals and plants to name their own tribes or clans. The Incas also worship the corn god, the potato god and the clan ancestors.
In the Inca faith, the dead will never leave the world of the living, he is merely transformed into another state of living, so the Incas made mummy, just to maintain and continue the reverence of the dead. Mummy, dressed in costumes and wearing jewellery, with daily necessities and food, is mostly buried in graves made of rock. The Incas’s mummy worship of the rulers was the most devout. Inca during the grand festival, they carried these mummies out of the parade. When they were in combat, they also carried mummies. They believed that these mummies had extraordinary powers to bless them and make them victorious and victorious. The Indians also believe that if the ancestors' widow, the mummy, is destroyed, the living person loses the right to own the land, and in the harsh and harsh environment of the Andes, the loss of land means death. In addition, in the ancient Inca beliefs, if the ancestors were angry, the living beings were destined to become sick, fall down, and even die. They are convinced that the dead control the power of nature and thus determine the life and death of the living.
The inanimate person controls the fate of the living, and the power of the mummies is the power of the living being. The ancient Incas combined the worship of the mummies, ancestors and the sun gods, thus creating this unique and unique phenomenon in the history of human culture.
In order to keep the population growing, infanticide and adultery are subject to severe punishment in the Inca society; marriage is an obligation and there is almost no such thing. The relationship between young men and women in Inca is limited by bloodline and geography. The intermarriage between different classes in the Inca society is only for men, that is, the aristocratic male can marry the daughter of ordinary people. The woman’s high climb is envied, but if she is married, she will automatically drop the class and be despised. In addition, all Incas must choose a spouse in their own community, the marriage object is limited to the family, relatives inside, do not allow different provinces, villages and inter-marriage. Furthermore, marriage must also meet the age requirement, that is, the woman is 18 to 20 years old and the man is 24 years old, indicating that it is time to take on family responsibilities. Finally, you need to get parental consent. The Inca Empire stipulates that marriages that are not recognized by parents are invalid.
The Inca wedding, held every other year or two, on a specific day, is held simultaneously throughout the country, and is personally hosted by the Inca King. Some people joked that this is the largest collective marriage in the world. The Incas regard the wife as the gift of the Inca king, and regard marriage as the grace of the king and his own glory, once again confirming that the family-in-law system promoted by Inca has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. In short, in the Inca society, the wedding seems to follow only the parents, and the children have no personal freedom to choose. The Incas have the custom of trying to marry. If they live together for a while and find that they are not in harmony, both men and women can return to their parents' homes. If there are children, the children will be with the mother. For the Incas, marriage is an obligation, so if someone does not have a girlfriend, the official will help him to choose one. There is also a phenomenon of buying a wife in the Inca society; adultery is subject to death. Polygamy is only prevalent among the Inca kings and other high officials.
Inca women must deliver their own births and must do family work shortly after birth; twins or deformed children are considered ominous. Moreover, women's abortion is an unfortunate thing. If you want to re-pregnancy, you must first curse by the wizard. In addition, spinning and family matters are the main tasks of women, and they must also accompany the husband. All Inca women are protected by law and their husbands cannot violently abuse or abuse them.
When the Inca baby was born, no matter how cold the weather was at birth, it must be bathed in a bowl of cold water. In the future, the cold bath is the first ""homework"" for the baby to wake up every morning. Inca parents believe that the cold bath for children is to make the child strong and able to withstand the cold. And what Inca parents are more concerned about is that a cold bath can train the next generation to work hard.
Feeding children in Inca society no more than three times a day. The Incas believe that this is taken from nature, and the animals are breastfeeding the cubs at a certain time, rather than feeding them all day without restraint. They also think that if a child is used to eating milk, it is easy to vomit and diarrhea, and when he grows up, he will become a greedy guy. So after removing the prescribed three times, even if the child cries and cries, the mother will not appease him by feeding. In addition, most of the time Inca children are alone in the cradle, even when feeding, Inca women never hold their children in their arms. The Incas believe that this is to let the children practice eating and actively eating while eating, and let the children learn to stand up early, and also let parents have more time to work hard for their livelihood. The baby is two years old and has a big change in life. First of all, from this day on, the mother no longer feeds the child, and does not gradually replace the milk with the transitional measures of the meal, but suddenly weaning and changing the food. Secondly, this day, the child is shaved. The Incas believe that this is to make the child ""make a face"" and since then has the image of a civilized person.
In terms of daily life, the Inca nobles have three meals a day, and the general public only has a brunch. Women usually dine back to the gentleman and are not allowed to drink until the meal. They usually bathe once in two days, but avoid the days of the upper and lower chords, because they think that they are bathed in these days and are vulnerable to disease.
The Inca law is more tolerant of the nobility than the general public. The death penalty is a common punishment. In addition, criminals are sometimes locked up with beasts. The child sins, the father is punished, but the parents sin and the sins are not as good as the children. Inadvertently burning the house must be responsible for reconstruction. Peeping must be punished, but if the three meals are not good enough to steal, officials must provide the offender food.
The Incas regard the big ears as beautiful and noble. The inspiration of the Inca nobles is that they almost have a shocking ear. Such large ears are not derived from nature, they are entirely artificially carved, and the result of willing efforts. At the rite ceremony, the Inca noble men wore a large hole in the ear with a needle made of gold, wearing a huge gold earring, and became a big ear over time. In addition, the Incas believe that haircuts are a symbol of civilized people, and only barbarians must be untidy.
In short, before the Spanish colonists arrived in the Americas, the Indians had established their own unique culture. This culture is somewhat different from the ancient cultures of the Old World. First of all, the ancient culture of the Old World originated from the Great River Basin, but the birthplace of the New World culture of the Americas was in the basin. For example, the Aztec culture originated in the Mexican Basin, and the Inca culture of South America originated from the Cusco Basin. Secondly, the staple food of the residents of the Old World is wheat and rice, while the Indians mainly rely on corn, so they are also called ""corn culture."" Moreover, although Indians do not know the use of horses, iron, plows and vehicles, many of the things human life today, such as potatoes, corn, tomatoes, tobacco, cocoa, turkeys, alpacas and livestock, poultry, etc., are The Indians first cultivated and provided them to Europe and the rest of the world, enriching the material and economic life of human beings and bringing great contributions to human culture.
Note: The Inca Empire regards mutual help in the neighborhood as a law, called the “Brothers Mutual Aid Law”, which stipulates the mutual love and mutual assistance between the villagers in the same village, and helps each other to complete farming, harvesting, or construction projects that cannot be completed independently. This mutual help and mutual support model makes everyone happy to do heavy work.

Peru, the country that gave birth to the ancient Inca Empire, is full of mysterious atmosphere!
Since time immemorial, Peru has been obstructed by the north and south of the Andes, but the civilization has long been developing here. After the fifteenth century, the Incas established a high and splendid Inca civilization. They worshiped the sun god, liked to collect the gold that symbolizes the sun's rays, and lived themselves as the ""people of the sun."" However, the legend of the ""Golden Country"" turned into a fuse of the empire of the empire in the sixteenth century after the Spanish landed in South America.
The Spanish colonization of Peru for more than three hundred years has left a profound impact on Peru's political society and cultural customs. Peru, which has become independent after the eighteenth century, still cannot escape the control of authoritarian politics. Nowadays, political corruption, economic industry decline, and international disputes, how Peru should break through the difficulties, let us wait and see.
This book will tell you about Peru's myths and legends, food culture, and humanities. It also counts the political, social, and economic issues that have been experienced since the Inca civilization, the Spanish colonial period, and the independent establishment of Peru. Look at the true face of Peru.
