04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是一九四九年過後七十週年，《迅猛的力量》一書帶領我們重回這個歷史轉捩點的現場。對於一九四九，本書旨不在禮讚，也不在喟嘆，更不是宣傳，而是細膩地重建那一整年的來龍去脈，變化流轉，作者描繪歷史如何隨著各方行動者的合縱連橫、計算與失算，一步一步展開。



文：涂豐恩（哈佛大學東亞系博士、「故事」網站創辦人）
推薦序：一九四九，是誰丟掉了中國？
一九四九，這是石破天驚的一年，這是翻天覆地的一年。共產黨勢力席捲中國，勢如破竹；國民黨節節敗退，終於將江山拱手讓人，避居一塊陌生的小島。從此神州易幟，山河變色。
這是台灣讀者不會陌生的一段歷史。
十年之後，退居台灣的蔣經國出版了一本小書，由中華民國國防部印製。序言中，他這樣寫著：「民國三十八年，可以說是中華民族的『危急存亡之秋』；在這一年中，國家民族所遭遇的困難，以及我父親所處的地位環境，乃是空前未有的惡劣和複雜。國運正如黑夜孤舟，在汪洋大海的狂風暴雨和驚滔駭浪中飄搖震盪；存續淪亡，決於俄頃。」
這本書，就叫《危急存亡之秋》。
《危急存亡之秋》收錄了蔣經國一九四九一整年的日記。書中他痛罵「朱毛匪幫」是「民族敗類」，同一時間又不禁哀嘆：「當此存亡絕續之交，危疑震撼之際，我在戰場上的軍心渙散，損兵折將，在政壇上的動搖怕死，變節投降，在經濟上的物資匱乏，金融紊亂，真是敗象亡徵，江河潰決。」
那年春節，大年初一，他黎明即起，在日記中寫道：「念一年又過，來年如何，實難想像；更不知有多少人在痛苦和憂愁中，度此年節。目前整個社會，充滿了血和淚，我縱慾新年言吉語，但事實如此，又如之何！」
到了四月二十五日，國民黨軍隊已經棄守首都南京。前一天，蔣經國將妻兒送往台灣避難，這天則準備和父親撤離溪口。他看著故鄉，心中百感交集，全反映在日記中：「極目四望，溪水無語，雖未流淚，但悲痛之情，難以言宣。……大好河山，幾至無立錐之地！且溪口為祖宗廬墓所在，今一拋別，其沉痛之心情，更非筆墨所能形容於萬一。誰為為之，孰令致之？一息尚存，勢必重回故土。」
幾天之後，解放軍渡過長江，國民黨大勢已去。
但蔣經國的日記不只記錄了這些哀傷與悲痛，他還處處要為父親蔣介石辯護，說他「堅貞不二」、「不屈不撓」，又說他以「大無畏的精神、忍人之不能忍」，才能在這危急存亡之秋，「起死回生、轉危為安」。
這是許多人再熟悉不過的敘事與修辭。國土淪喪的憤恨、流離失所的無奈，大江大海轉眼之間成了殘山剩水，只剩民族偉人仍在力撐危局，頂天立地。在那心心念念反攻大陸的年代，這是歷史教科書中不能略過的一頁。
但中華民國課本裡頭不會寫的，是同樣那年，有另外一群人正在歡欣鼓舞，迎接新中國成立。曾經擔任過孫中山臨時大總統祕書的詩人柳亞子，看著紅星就將照耀大地，難掩興奮之情，熱情地寫下這樣的詩句：
太陽出來滿地紅，我們有個毛澤東。人民受苦三千年，今日翻身樂無窮。太陽出來東方明，我們有個總司令。雲台麟閣非吾願，咱就人民子弟兵。
如此直白的詩句難稱高明，但倒也襯托出詩人發自內心的喜悅，如此誠摯，如此天真，慶祝新時代來臨。
曾於《大公報》與《文匯報》任職的報人徐鑄成，則在那年十月六日的日記中寫著：「回顧這一年內，祖國的變化真大。今天，能在北京參加開國盛典，並在此度中秋佳節。祝願五億同胞，從此脫離苦海，年年歡度團圓節，共慶太平、自由、幸福，共慶國家日益富強康盛。」
擺脫了國民黨的中國，看來似乎前途一片光明，充滿無限希望。
只是，徐鑄成寫下這些話的幾年後，捲入一場政治風暴，被指為為資產階級代言的右派，因而遭到當局嚴厲批判，甚至面臨降職降薪的懲罰。何其諷刺，新中國似乎不如期望中美好，而歷史變化總是讓人難以預料。
難以預料的歷史變化當然不只這一樁。內戰七十年過後，國共雙方已經不再劍拔弩張，反倒握手言和，相親相愛。此情此景，若是蔣介石與蔣經國得以目睹，恐怕也要感到意外萬分，不知該說是歷史捉弄人，還是人捉弄了歷史。總之，時代果真是不一樣了，國共不兩立，如今換成了兩岸一家親。
而經過這些年的局勢變換，國共內戰的歷史書寫，也不再像過去一樣，停留在心戰喊話、洗腦宣傳——至少在海峽的這一岸如此。隨著越來越多公私檔案開放、個人日記出土，以及各方研究的推進，我們對當年那場戰爭與那個時代，也有了更全面和更深入的理解。
一九四九年過後七十週年，《迅猛的力量》一書帶領我們重回這個歷史轉捩點的現場。對於一九四九，本書旨不在禮讚，也不在喟嘆，更不是宣傳，而是細膩地重建那一整年的來龍去脈，變化流轉，作者描繪歷史如何隨著各方行動者的合縱連橫、計算與失算，一步一步展開。
《迅猛的力量》講的是一個國共內戰的故事，但也不只是一個國共雙方的故事。在國共背後，我們會讀到美蘇兩大勢力在二次戰後的角力，以及美蘇內部各種不同意見的衝突。國共、美蘇，都非鐵板一塊。我們因此看見，身為美國總統的杜魯門，與擘劃外交事務的國務卿艾奇遜，在理念上不時齟齬，也看到親蔣與棄蔣的勢力，如何互相傾軋。當然，隨著時局的變換，各方陣營也必須隨之做出調整，與時俱進。
國共之間的成與敗，不能只從中國內部來解釋，還必須納入國際政治的視角。作者利用外語的文獻，包括美國與俄國的檔案，補上了過去中文著作較為少見的部分。
不過，本書寫蘇聯的篇幅，遠遠不如寫美方內部情勢來的豐富和細緻。這自然與作者凱文．裴萊諾（Kevin Peraino）的背景脫不了關係。凱文．裴萊諾曾長期任職於美國著名的《新聞週刊》（Newsweek），前一本書寫的是林肯。他念茲在茲的，還是一個美國外交史的老命題：是誰丟掉了中國？
前芝加哥大學政治學教授鄒讜，在一九六〇年代出版的代表作《美國在中國的失敗（1941-1950）》，早已處理過這項問題。在本書一開頭，鄒讜如此解釋何謂美國的失敗：「蔣介石委員長對中國發生的一切比任何人都要承擔更多的責任，因為責任與權力是成正比的，而蔣曾是中國最有權勢的人物。然而，如果用美國的目的、意圖、利益衡量其政策，那麼美國的政策是失敗的。在抗日戰爭中，國民黨中國曾是美國的盟友；在朝鮮戰場上，共產黨中國打敗了美國軍隊，並且作為強國出現在世界上。」
在二十世紀初年開始，美國便開始關注中國情勢變化。當時中國正受到列強的勢力進逼，而美國算是晚發的帝國主義者。從那時開始，美國國內的政治菁英，便自認抱持高尚的政治理念，要協助中國平等地進入國際社會，甚至成為大國。這樣的理想，從一八九九年「門戶開放政策」開始浮現，而到二次世界大戰末期更為具體成形。
因此，在一九四九年之後，美國人想問：自己到底犯了什麼錯，才會導致進退失據，原本目標成為夢幻泡影，而國際情勢失去掌控，紅色勢力席捲亞洲？
就這個問題而言，凱文．裴萊諾未必有什麼驚天動地、超乎前人見解的答案。此外，要回答這個問題，也恐怕無法只看一九四九這一年，而必須追索到更早以前，理解各種遠因近因。
但《迅猛的力量》寓解釋於敘事，巧妙地將幾條不同主線交織在一起，讓我們看見一個更為豐富的歷史圖像——這才是本書的價值所在。作者只用了十分簡約的篇幅，陳述自己對這段歷史的主張與評價，讀者在翻閱過這歷史長卷後，自然會在心中形成自己的判斷。
本書值得一提的，是作者講故事的技巧。對非虛構寫作感興趣的讀者，不妨將此書視為參考之作。凱文．裴萊諾發揮記者本色，精巧佈局，娓娓道來。開頭幾章先描寫幾位故事中的不同主角，讓這幾人的形象躍然紙上，為後半段的敘事做好準備。他尤其擅長用生動細節，勾勒人物的性格，如講到蔣夫人宋美齡：
有一天，羅斯福夫婦和宋美齡共進晚餐時，話題轉到工會政治。羅斯福請教這位中國第一夫人在面對興風作浪的工會領袖時會怎麼做。艾蓮諾日後回憶，宋美齡「一句話都沒說，只舉起美麗的小手在她喉嚨前比劃了一下」。
又如手握大權的美國總統杜魯門：
他的頸部和下顎出現脂肪肥腫，略顯癡肥。他的頭髮也開始掉色，從原本的胡椒灰色變成亮銀色。不過，總統的大笑臉減少了衰弱的感覺。他和老戰友嬉笑喧鬧——不時露出已變色的門牙。他現在的身材似乎使他有種彈跳力量，是他在第一任期內所欠缺的權威感。
看來不像全世界最有權力的男人。至於國務卿艾奇遜，
聞起來就像一家理髮店，在他的小鬍子抹些蠟，在頭髮也抹上一些乳液。他讓眉毛長得長而濃密，就像一簇簇軟草，但是他的小鬍子卻咄咄逼人。記者詹姆斯．芮斯頓（James Reston）將艾奇遜臉部毛髮形容為「政策規劃的勝利成績」。就艾奇遜而言，紅肉、馬汀尼酒、和對政敵尖酸苛評是美好一天必不可少的主食。
還有後來在中國呼風喚雨的毛澤東，根據作者的說法，在第一次與史達林會面時，其實感到焦慮不安。對於俄國十分冷待的外交接待，更明顯有所不悅。表面上毛澤東在莫斯科慷慨激昂發表演說，私底下他卻對整趟旅程抱怨連連，不滿下榻處所的枕頭太軟，吃不到新鮮的魚片，外加鬧便秘。一代革命家，終究也只是凡人。而歷史是由這樣一群凡人寫成的。
本書在中美貿易大戰打的正酣之際問世。在這個時刻，作者重訪這段歷史曲折，心中自然有著當代的關懷。但他書寫的對象是美國讀者，而今中譯本問世，在台灣閱讀這本書，又有什麼意義呢？
第一，正如作者所說，一九四九年其實尚未結束，對台灣人而言，這一點恐怕最能感受。當年留下的格局，至今依舊牽動著台灣各項政治議程。
不過除此之外，我以為還有另一個面向值得深思。裴萊諾在書中提到了一段故事。一九四九年十二月二十一日，艾奇遜與提出圍堵蘇聯政策的肯楠（George Kennan）先後在美國國家戰爭學院發表演說。肯楠對聽眾說：「人類根本無從了解真相的全面性。……即使是最高明的戰略家也『只看到一部分』和『預言一部分』。」
在變幻莫測國際政治中，其實沒有誰能有絕對的把握，也不應該自以為有絕對的把握。美國如此、台灣當然也是如此。大國未必無所不能，小國也未必只是棋子，人人都必須做好準備，步步為營，謀求自身最大利益。對於身處帝國夾縫台灣而言，認知到這一點，才有可能在多方角力的世界上，停止作繭自縛，進而積極地尋求和創造屬於自己的生存空間。

2019年正值中共建政七十週年，美中貿易戰事正酣，焦慮的中國官員和官媒一片同仇敵愾，認為今天美國的政策是1949年出現過的圍堵戰略之續集。他們擔心美國部隊在東亞地區的部署和訓練任務，也密切注意西藏、新疆和台灣等熱點地區，懷疑美國一如以往想從中作梗。
若要理解當今的美中台關係，就必須了解七十年前這段歷史。《迅猛的力量》帶我們重回這個歷史轉捩點的現場。
1949年頭幾個月，美國總統杜魯門面臨了迫在眉睫的外交浩劫。整個春天和夏天，毛澤東的共產黨部隊擴散到中國大陸各地，殲滅美國盟友蔣介石的部隊，並控制了北京、上海和其他主要城市。杜魯門和他的助手，包括精明而無情的國務卿狄恩．艾奇遜，忙著應付快速變化的局勢，不僅要與毛澤東鬥爭，還要對付國內政敵的猛烈攻擊。杜魯門和艾奇遜甚至透過公布白皮書的消極作為，無情地指控蔣介石，並承認毛澤東的革命已超出美國的影響力。在此過程中，美國的角色，上自政府組織下至許許多多個別人士，其政策規劃與制定、諸多大膽的假設與曾經被束之高閣的建言、對國共內戰「錯誤」的局勢推論，許多作為與消極的不作為，對後來的美中台關係有著深遠的影響。
在這動盪的一年，毛澤東在北京建立了新的革命政府，為打造現代中國奠定基礎，而蔣介石則退守台灣基地。這些事件改變了美國的外交政策，最終導致了華府與共產中國數十年的摩擦、美國對台灣的長期承諾，以及隨後在朝鮮和越南的戰爭。
美國的決策者為了因應毛澤東的勝勢所做出的回應，彼此也產生了激烈的爭論。有人想和毛澤東打交道，有人想要對抗他，也有一些人完全不想理會他。在這些不同的主張中，還存在著千絲萬縷的細微差異。這些爭端不僅僅是戰術上的意見分歧，也反映出美國與中國關係的本質存在深刻的分歧，及美國自身的矛盾。1949年年底，美國將原本主要限於歐洲的圍堵共產主義政策延伸到亞洲。杜魯門政府制定了一項雄心勃勃的計畫——包括一連串祕密作業——來支持中國周邊國家。即使毛澤東鞏固了對大陸的控制，美國也悄悄提供金錢和武器給他的敵人。
本書作者凱文．裴萊諾引用中國和俄羅斯的文件資料，及最近中央情報局解密的檔案，精巧佈局、娓娓道來，也揭露許多過去鮮為人知的歷史。他透過主要參與者的眼睛來敘述這個非凡之年的故事，包括毛澤東、杜魯門總統、國務卿艾奇遜、明尼蘇達州國會眾議員周以德，以及蔣介石的夫人宋美齡，巧妙地將幾條不同主線交織在一起，並加上國際政治的視角，讓我們看見一個更為豐富的歷史圖像。
凱文．裴萊諾細膩地重建那一整年的來龍去脈，變化流轉，描繪歷史如何隨著各方行動者的合縱連橫、計算與失算，隨著時序一步一步地展開。在其中，我們看到美國總統杜魯門與擘劃外交事務的國務卿艾奇遜，在理念上不時齟齬，也看到親蔣與棄蔣的勢力如何互相傾軋，以及中華民國極具影響力的第一夫人宋美齡如何運籌帷幄。隨著時局的變換，各方陣營也隨之做出調整，與時俱進。
在今天，1949年的時代意義，對中國、美國和世界其他地區之間的關係，比以往任何時候都來得重要。因為北京對南海提出主權聲索，而台灣與大陸之間的緊張關係仍然存在。在這本探討1949年蔣介石政府垮台、毛澤東共產主義勢力獲勝的作品中，這場非同尋常的政治革命至今仍影響著東亞政治。

What we want you to know is the 70th anniversary of 1949. The book ""The Power of Power"" leads us back to the scene of this historical turning point. For 1949, the purpose of this book is not to praise, not to sigh, not to publicize, but to refine the ins and outs of the whole year, change the flow, the author describes how history is connected with the actors of all parties. Calculations and miscalculations, step by step.



Text: Tu Fengen (Dr., Department of East Asian Studies, Harvard University, founder of ""Story"" website)
Recommended order: 1929, who lost China?
In 1949, this was a year of rock-shattering. This is a year of earth-shaking. The Communist Party’s forces swept through China, and it was like a broken bamboo. The Kuomintang’s defeated the festival and finally shunned the people and avoided a strange island. Since then, the state of the country has changed, and the mountains and rivers have changed color.
This is a history that Taiwanese readers will not be unfamiliar with.
Ten years later, Chiang Ching-kuo, who retired to Taiwan, published a small book, which was printed by the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China. In the preface, he wrote: ""In the 38th year of the Republic of China, it can be said that the Chinese nation is in danger of survival. In this year, the difficulties encountered by the nation and the status environment of my father, It is unprecedentedly harsh and complicated. The national movement is like a lonely boat in the night, swaying and swaying in the storms and horror waves of the vast oceans and seas;
This book is called ""Autumn of Sudden Death.""
""Autumn in the End of Life"" contains the diary of Jiang Jingguo in 1941. In the book, he screamed that ""Zhu Mao's gang"" was a ""national scum"". At the same time, he could not help but lament: ""When this is a dead end, when the crisis is in jeopardy, my military on the battlefield will be distracted, and the soldiers will be defeated in politics. The wavering and fear of death, the surrender and surrender, the lack of economic resources, the financial disorder, it is really defeated, and the rivers are broken.""
In the Spring Festival that year, on the first day of the New Year, he started at dawn, and wrote in his diary: ""It’s hard to imagine what it’s been like in the coming year. I don’t know how many people are in pain and sorrow. At present, the whole society is full of blood and tears. I want to speak the New Year’s words, but this is the case, and what is it!""
On April 25th, the Kuomintang army had abandoned the capital Nanjing. The day before, Chiang Ching-kuo sent his wife and children to Taiwan to take refuge. On this day, he was preparing to evacuate his father with his father. He looked at his hometown, and his feelings were mixed in his heart. All of them were reflected in the diary: ""There is nothing to look at, the stream is speechless, although it is not crying, but the grief is hard to tell. ... great rivers and mountains, few to the ground without a cone! And Xikou is The ancestral tomb of the ancestors, this day, throwing away, its painful mood, can not be described in the pen and ink. Who is it, what is the order, and it will be returned to the homeland.""
A few days later, the People’s Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and the KMT’s general trend had gone.
However, Chiang Ching-kuo’s diary not only records these griefes and sorrows, he also defends his father, Chiang Kai-shek, and says that he is “stubborn and indomitable” and that he can’t bear the spirit of “great fearlessness and endurance”. In this critically dying autumn, ""return to life and turn to safety.""
This is a narrative and rhetoric that many people are familiar with. The resentment of the country and the helplessness of displacement, the rivers and the seas have become the residual water of the mountains, and only the great men of the country are still trying to support the crisis. In the age when the mind was attacking the mainland, this was a page that could not be skipped in history textbooks.
But in the textbook of the Republic of China, it is not the same. In the same year, another group of people are rejoicing and welcoming the founding of New China. Liu Yazi, a poet who once served as the secretary of the temporary president of Sun Yat-sen, will watch the red star shine on the earth, and it is difficult to hide the excitement and enthusiastically write such a verse:
The sun is full of red, we have a Mao Zedong. The people have suffered for three thousand years and today they are full of joy. The sun came out to the East, we have a commander-in-chief. Yuntai Linge is not my wish, and he is a member of the people.
Such a straightforward verse is hard to call a brilliant, but it also sets off the joy of the poet from the heart, so sincere, so naive, to celebrate the new era.
Xu Zhucheng, a reporter who had served in Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, wrote in his diary on October 6 that year: ""Recalling the changes in the motherland during this year. Today, I can participate in the founding ceremony in Beijing. In this Mid-Autumn Festival, I wish the 500 million compatriots to leave the sea of suffering and celebrate the reunion every year to celebrate the peace, freedom and happiness of the country and celebrate the country's growing prosperity.""
Getting rid of the Kuomintang’s China seems to be a bright future with boundless hope.
However, a few years after Xu Zhucheng wrote these words, he was involved in a political storm and was accused of being a rightist for the bourgeoisie. He was severely criticized by the authorities and even faced the punishment of demotion and salary reduction. How ironic, New China does not seem to be as good as expected, and historical changes are always unpredictable.
Unpredictable historical changes are certainly not the only one. After 70 years of the civil war, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are no longer arrogant, but they shake hands and love each other. In this situation, if Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo are able to witness it, I am afraid that I will be surprised. I don’t know if it’s history to tease people, or people have teased history. In short, the times are really different. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party are not two. Now they have become a family on both sides.
After these years of change in the situation, the history of the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is no longer the same as in the past, staying in the heart and the words, brainwashing propaganda - at least on the shore of the strait. With more and more public and private archives open, personal diaries unearthed, and the advancement of research by all parties, we have a more comprehensive and deeper understanding of the war and that era.
After the 70th anniversary of 1949, the book ""The Power of Rapidness"" led us back to the scene of this historical turning point. For 1949, the purpose of this book is not to praise, not to sigh, not to publicize, but to refine the ins and outs of the whole year, change the flow, the author describes how history is connected with the actors of all parties. Calculations and miscalculations, step by step.
""The Power of Rapidness"" tells the story of a civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but it is not just a story of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Behind the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we will read the struggle between the two major forces of the United States and the Soviet Union after the Second World War and the conflicts between the various opinions within the United States and the Soviet Union. The Kuomintang, the United States and the Soviet Union are not a piece of iron. As a result, we have seen that Truman, the US president, and Acheson, the secretary of state for foreign affairs, have been embarrassed from time to time in their ideas. They have also seen how the forces of pro-Jiang and abandoning Chiang are intertwined. Of course, with the change of the current situation, the camps of all parties must also make adjustments to keep pace with the times.
The success or failure between the KMT and the Communist Party cannot be explained only from within China, but must also be incorporated into the perspective of international politics. The author's use of foreign language literature, including US and Russian archives, complements the less common parts of past Chinese writings.
However, the length of writing the Soviet Union is far less than the richness and meticulousness of writing the internal situation of the United States. This is natural with the author Kevin. The background of Kevin Peraino can't be separated. Kevin.裴Lenault has long worked in the famous Newsweek in the United States, and the previous one was written by Lincoln. He is here, and is still an old proposition of American diplomatic history: Who lost China?
Former University of Chicago political science professor Zou Wei, published in the 1960s, ""The Failure of the United States in China (1941-1950)"", has already dealt with this issue. At the beginning of this book, Zou Yu explained why the United States failed: ""Jiang Jieshi’s chairmanship of China is more responsible than anyone else, because responsibility and power are directly proportional, and Jiang was the most in China. Powerful figures. However, if US policies, intentions, and interests are used to measure their policies, then US policy is a failure. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang China was an ally of the United States; on the Korean battlefield, the Communist China defeated the United States. The army, and as a powerful country, appears in the world.""
Beginning in the early years of the twentieth century, the United States began to pay attention to changes in the Chinese situation. At that time, China was being forced by the powers of the powers, and the United States was considered a late imperialist. Since then, the political elites in the United States have recognized their noble political ideas and assisted China in entering the international community on an equal footing and even becoming a big country. Such an ideal emerged from the ""open door policy"" in 1899 and became more concrete at the end of the Second World War.
Therefore, after 1949, the Americans wanted to ask: What mistakes did they make, which led to the loss of the data, the original goal became a dream bubble, and the international situation lost control, and the red forces swept through Asia?
In terms of this issue, Kevin.裴Lenno may not have any earth-shattering, more than the answers of previous insights. In addition, to answer this question, I am afraid I can’t just look at the year of 1949, but I have to revisit it earlier and understand the various causes and causes.
But ""The Power of Power"" is explained in the narrative, cleverly intertwining several different main lines, let us see a richer historical image - this is the value of this book. The author only used a very simple space to state his own opinions and evaluations on this history. After reading this historical scroll, the reader will naturally form his own judgment in his heart.
What is worth mentioning in this book is the author's skill in telling stories. Readers interested in non-fiction writing may wish to consider this book as a reference. Kevin.裴Lino played the true color of the reporter, and the layout was exquisite. The first few chapters first describe the different protagonists in several stories, let the images of these people jump on the paper and prepare for the second half of the narrative. He is especially good at using vivid details to outline the character of the character, such as Mrs. Jiang Songmeiling:
One day, when the Roosevelt and Song Meiling had dinner together, the topic turned to trade union politics. Roosevelt asked the Chinese First Lady what to do when she faced the trade union leader who was making waves. Ellenor recalled in the future that Song Meiling ""had not said a word, only raised a beautiful little hand and stroked her throat.""
Another example is US President Truman, who holds power:
His neck and jaw were fat and fat, slightly obese. His hair also began to fade, from the original pepper gray to bright silver. However, the president’s big smile reduced the feeling of weakness. He and his old comrades are laughing and laughing - from time to time to reveal the discolored front teeth. His current figure seems to give him a kind of bounce power, which is the sense of authority he lacked during his first term.
It doesn't look like the most powerful man in the world. As for Secretary of State Acheson,
It smells like a barber shop, puts some wax on his moustache, and puts some lotion on his hair. He made the eyebrows grow long and thick, like a cluster of soft grass, but his moustache was aggressive. Reporter James. James Reston described Acheson's facial hair as ""a successful achievement in policy planning."" As far as Acheson is concerned, red meat, Martini, and harsh acidity against political opponents are essential staples for a good day.
And Mao Zedong, who later called for rain in China, according to the author, was actually anxious when he first met with Stalin. It is even more unpleasant for the diplomatic reception that Russia is very cold. On the surface, Mao Zedong gave a generous speech in Moscow. In private, he complained about the whole journey. The pillows that were dissatisfied with the place were too soft to eat fresh fish fillets, and constipation. A generation of revolutionaries, after all, is only a mortal. History is written by such a group of mortals.
This book came out at the height of the Sino-US trade war. At this moment, the author revisits this historical twist, and naturally has a contemporary concern. But what he wrote is an American reader. Now that the Chinese translation is published, what is the point of reading this book in Taiwan?
First, as the author said, 1949 is actually not over. For Taiwanese, this is probably the most sensible. The pattern left by that year still affects Taiwan’s political agenda.
But beyond that, I thought there was another face worth pondering.裴Leno mentioned a story in the book. On December 21, 1949, Acheson and George Kennan, who proposed to contain the Soviet policy, gave speeches at the National War College. Kennan said to the audience: ""Humans have no way of understanding the comprehensiveness of the truth.... Even the most savvy strategists ""see only a part"" and ""a part of the prophecy.""
In the unpredictable international politics, no one can have absolute certainty, and should not think that there is absolute certainty. This is true of the United States and Taiwan. A big country may not be omnipotent, and a small country may not be just a chess piece. Everyone must be prepared, step by step, and seek their own best interests. For Taiwan in the empire, it is only in this world that it is possible to stop self-restraint in the multi-party world and actively seek and create its own living space.

In 2019, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the US-China trade war is awkward, and anxious Chinese officials and official media are in the same enemy. They believe that today's US policy is a sequel to the containment strategy that emerged in 1949. They are worried about the deployment and training tasks of US troops in East Asia, and they are also paying close attention to hotspots such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. They suspect that the United States wants to succumb to it as before.
To understand today's US-China relations, you must understand the history of 70 years ago. ""The Power of Rapidness"" takes us back to the scene of this historical turning point.
In the first few months of 1949, US President Truman faced an imminent diplomatic catastrophe. Throughout the spring and summer, Mao Zedong’s Communist forces spread across mainland China, annihilating the troops of US ally Chiang Kai-shek and controlling Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities. Truman and his assistants, including the savvy and ruthless Secretary of State Dean. Acheson is busy dealing with the rapidly changing situation, not only to fight against Mao Zedong, but also to deal with the fierce attacks by domestic political opponents. Truman and Acheson even ruthlessly accuse Chiang Kai-shek of the negatives of the white paper and acknowledge that Mao Zedong’s revolution has exceeded the influence of the United States. In this process, the role of the United States, from the government organization to many other people, its policy planning and formulation, many bold assumptions and the once-conceived suggestions, the ""wrong"" situation of the Kuomintang civil war, many As a negative inaction, it has a profound influence on the later US-China relations.
In this turbulent year, Mao Zedong established a new revolutionary government in Beijing, laying the foundation for building a modern China, while Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the Taiwan base. These events changed the US foreign policy, which eventually led to decades of friction between Washington and the Communist China, the US's long-term commitment to Taiwan, and the subsequent wars in North Korea and Vietnam.
In response to the response of Mao Zedong’s victory, US policymakers have also had heated debates. Some people want to deal with Mao Zedong, some want to fight against him, and some people do not want to pay attention to him. Among these different claims, there are still many nuances. These disputes are not only tactical differences of opinion, but also reflect deep differences in the nature of US-China relations and the contradictions of the United States itself. At the end of 1949, the United States extended the policy of containment of communism, which was mainly limited to Europe, to Asia. The Truman administration has developed an ambitious plan – including a series of secret operations – to support China's neighboring countries. Even if Mao Zedong consolidated its control over the mainland, the United States quietly provided money and weapons to his enemies.
The author of the book Kevin.裴Leno cites documents from China and Russia, and recently the files declassified by the CIA, which are elaborately laid out and snarled, revealing many historically unknown history. He tells the story of this extraordinary year through the eyes of the main participants, including Mao Zedong, President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, Minnesota Congressman Zhou Yide, and Chiang Kai-shek’s wife Song Meiling, cleverly intertwining several different main lines. And with the perspective of international politics, let us see a richer historical image.
Kevin.裴Lenno delicately reconstructs the ins and outs of the whole year, changes the flow, and describes how history is progressing step by step with the continuation, calculation and miscalculation of the actors. Among them, we saw that US President Truman and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Acheson have been embarrassed from time to time, and they have seen how the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Kai-shek are intertwined, and the Republic of China is influential. How does a lady Song Meiling manage her strategy? With the change of the current situation, the camps of the parties have also made adjustments to keep pace with the times.
Today, the significance of the 1949 era, the relationship between China, the United States and the rest of the world is more important than ever. Because Beijing has raised sovereignty over the South China Sea, tensions between Taiwan and the mainland still exist. In this work exploring the victory of the Chiang Kai-shek government in 1949 and the victory of Mao Zedong's communist forces, this extraordinary political revolution still affects East Asian politics.
