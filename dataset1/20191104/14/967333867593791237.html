      <p>Bankrupt gold bullion dealer James Stunt apologised on Saturday to Prince Charles, whom he call a "friend," over allegations that he loaned "forged" artworks, including by Monet and Picasso, to the prince's charity.</p>
      <blockquote>"Let’s say they were fake. What is the crime of lending them to a stately home, [to] the Prince of Wales and putting them on display for the public to enjoy?" Stunt said in an Instagram video and added: "I give my huge apologies to the Prince of Wales."</blockquote>
      <p>An agreement <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906261076054486-uk-prince-charles-private-estate-assets-top-1bln-royal-accounts-revealed/">for a 10-year free lease</a> of 17 artworks to Dumfries House was signed by Michael Fawcett, Prince Charles’ former valet who is now chief executive of The Prince’s Foundation.</p>
      <p>US art forger Tony Tetro, however, claimed in a comment to the Daily Mail that three paintings out of the loaned 17, including "Monet's" water lilies are his forgeries.</p>
      <blockquote>"You can impress your friends with my pictures, decorate your homes with them, but they would never pass expert scrutiny," Tetro said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the outlet, two other works by "Picasso" and "Dali" are also forgeries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911031077211245-prince-charles-sends-back-105m-monet-picasso-dali-paintings/">The incident deepened on Sunday</a> amid reports that Stunt could have loaned other works to the Palace of Westminster with one of them being on display in the House of Lords. </p>
