      <p>Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/01/body-of-alleged-intruder-found-in-ditch-after-woman-shoots-him/">reported</a> the incident happened Wednesday and the woman retrieved a gun after two suspects allegedly entered a home and began pistol-whipping the husband.</p>
      <p>The woman fired one shot, striking one of the suspects, who then ran outside, collapsed in a ditch, and died. The second suspect fled the scene.</p>
      <p>Bay News 9 <a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2019/11/01/victim-of-violent-home-invasion-speaks--credits-wife-with-saving-his-life">reports</a> the woman was pregnant at the time of the alleged home intrusion, and she used an AR-15 to defend her husband and home.</p>
      <p>The husband, Jeremy King, described the harrowing incident: “They came in heavily hooded and masked. As soon as they had got the back door opened, they had a pistol on me and was grabbing my 11-year-old daughter.”</p>
      <p>He indicated his wife grabbed the AR-15, shot and hit one of the suspects. That suspect “made it from my back door to roughly 200 feet out in the front ditch before the AR did its thing.”</p>
