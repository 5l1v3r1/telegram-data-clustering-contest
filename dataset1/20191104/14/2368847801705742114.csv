抗議伊朗 伊拉克示威者闖領事館釀至少4死19傷

04 Nov 2019, 14:57

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】伊拉克10月爆發示威抗議，警方動用實彈及催淚瓦斯驅散抗議人潮，至今有逾270人在示威中喪生。3日晚間，距離首都巴格達西南100公里的卡爾巴拉(Karbala)，有示威者闖入伊朗領事館，抗議伊朗干預伊拉克的內政，導致最少4人死亡、19人受傷。
事發時，一批示威者包圍伊朗領事館，並嘗試翻越圍牆，圍牆上被噴上：「卡爾巴拉自由了！伊朗走！走！」，並向領事館投擲氣油彈。
示威者將領事館懸掛的伊朗國旗取下，並換上伊拉克國旗。安全部隊隨後向示威者開槍及施放催淚彈。有安全部官員證實，當晚有示威者被殺，亦有7名警員受傷。

上月29日，卡爾巴拉安全部隊開槍鎮壓示威者，衝突中至少13人喪生，865人受傷。
這次示威活動始於巴格達並傳播開來。一夜之間，卡爾巴拉有未經證實的報導稱示威者開槍打死打傷多人。有報導說，有些戴著面具的黑衣男子在示威中開火，有人認為他們是親伊朗的民兵。
據了解，儘管伊拉克擁有豐富石油資源，許多人仍貧窮度日，也有困難取得乾淨水源、電力、醫療保健及教育。
BBC報導，腐敗和失業是伊拉克兩個最大的問題。而伊拉克的一大悲慘現實是暴力在社會根深蒂固。當示威者為抗議失業、腐敗和政府在大街上振臂高呼時，當局很快就會用槍彈對付他們。
到目前為止，伊拉克街頭的遊行示威活動似乎沒有領袖組織。但伊拉克政府害怕隨時間和傷亡人數的變化，示威者會變得有組織性。

Protest against Iran, Iraqi demonstrators, consulates, at least 4 deaths and 19 injuries

04 Nov 2019, 14:57

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Iraq’s demonstrations broke out in October. The police used live ammunition and tear gas to dispel the protest crowd. More than 270 people have been killed in demonstrations so far. On the evening of the 3rd, in Karbala, 100 kilometers southwest of the capital Baghdad, demonstrators broke into the Iranian consulate to protest Iran’s intervention in Iraq’s internal affairs, resulting in at least four deaths and 19 injuries.
At the time of the incident, a group of demonstrators surrounded the Iranian consulate and tried to climb over the wall. The wall was sprayed: ""Karbala is free! Iran goes! Go!"" and throws a gas bomb at the consulate.
The demonstrators took down the Iranian flag hoisted by the consulate and replaced it with the Iraqi flag. The security forces then fired and fired tear gas at the demonstrators. A security official confirmed that seven demonstrators were killed and seven police officers were injured.

On the 29th of last month, the Karbala security forces fired and suppressed the demonstrators. At least 13 people were killed and 865 injured in the conflict.
The demonstration began in Baghdad and spread. Overnight, Karbala had unconfirmed reports that the demonstrators shot and killed many people. It has been reported that some black men wearing masks opened fire in demonstrations, and some believed that they were pro-Iranian militia.
It is understood that despite Iraq's rich oil resources, many people are still poor and have difficulty obtaining clean water, electricity, health care and education.
The BBC reported that corruption and unemployment are the two biggest problems in Iraq. A major tragic reality in Iraq is that violence is deeply rooted in society. When the demonstrators protested against unemployment, corruption and the government shouting on the streets, the authorities would soon use bullets to deal with them.
So far, there has been no leader organization in the demonstrations on the streets of Iraq. But the Iraqi government is afraid that the demonstrators will become organized as time and casualties change.
