Ex-Liverpool star slams Philippe Coutinho for being ""invisible"" and ""not improving""

Philippe Coutinho was ""invisible"" in Bayern Munich's 5-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt and hasn't improved since signing on loan for the Germans.
That's according to former Liverpool and Bayern Munich midfielder Dietmar Hamann, who even accused Coutinho of being ""frightened"" when he loses the ball.
Coutinho left Liverpool for Barcelona in a £142million deal in January 2018, but failed to cement a place in the first team and rapidly fell down the pecking order at the Camp Nou.
He was shipped out on loan to Bayern Munich in the summer and it was hoped he would turn things around in Germany.

But a number of Coutinho's performances have been slammed in recent weeks, with Hamann the latest to hit out at the Brazilian, labelling him ""invisible"".
Hamann added, as reported by AS: ""He's on loan for a year, played some games with Bayern and for me you can't seen an improvement in his performance.
""What annoys me is when you see this player is not prudent. If he loses a ball he can be frightened and anxious during the 90 minutes.""

Bayern's 5-1 defeat on the weekend cost Niko Kovac his job.
The German giants are now looking at Ajax manager Erik ten Hag as a possible replacement, while Jose Mourinho is also in the mix.
