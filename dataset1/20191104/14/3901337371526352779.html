      <p>He is one of the quickest players in the PSL, so it comes as no surprise that Thapelo Morena, opted for a car that is as quick as he is. Check out the Bafana Bafana star’s ride before joining Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
      <p>Morena’s rise in the local game has been nothing short of remarkable. Pitso Mosimane transformed the pacey winger into a right back after he joined from Bloemfontein Celtic.</p>
      <p>Since making the switch, the 26-year-old has managed to pin down the right back berth for both club and country as his own.</p>

      <p>Off the field, the Randfontein-born man is a doting father, who has a penchant for fast cars.</p>
      <p>Before joining Downs from Celtic, Morena revealed a stunning Golf IV GTI on his Instagram account, which he referred to as “his baby”</p>

      <p>It is possible that he has since upgraded his ride at the star-studded Downs parking lot.</p>
