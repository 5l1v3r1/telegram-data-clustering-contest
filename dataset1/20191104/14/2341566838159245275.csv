國台辦再提對台26條 陸委會：名為惠台實則利中

（中央社記者沈朋達台北4日電）中國國台辦今天公布對台「26項措施」，陸委會表示，該措施是去年「31項措施」的延伸擴大。「名為惠台、實則利中」的本質不變，政府將嚴肅看待、評估和妥慎應處。
中國國務院台灣事務辦公室和國家發改委4日聯名公布「關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施」，針對台灣企業和台灣民眾提出共26條的措施。
大陸委員會今天以書面方式表示，該等措施是在去年「對台31項措施」基礎上延伸擴大、變換花樣、包裝宣傳，相關內容不改「名為惠台、實則利中」本質，更夾帶進行一國兩制的政治操作，這是「習五條」後，北京當局對台政軍施壓、威脅逼迫台灣接受其一國兩制主張的兩面手法，其「拉打兩手」人盡皆知，也難以拉近兩岸距離。
陸委會指出，對岸在一年多後再度推出所謂「26條措施」，只是掩飾去年「31項措施」執行不彰的事實，也反映中國大陸經濟下行壓力及各部門間協調限制，實施成效言過其實，完全禁不起檢驗；更是反映這段期間以來台灣人民拒絕「一國兩制」、不認同中共統戰分化的結果。
陸委會稱，中共企圖透過融台促統政策措施、拉攏台灣，意圖分化台灣內部，更證明企圖介入影響台灣選舉。
陸委會表示，去年以來，政府已持續追蹤評估「31項措施」，及推動「壯大台灣」相關策略、優化台灣整體環境，並關注後續中共作為對台影響，提醒國人兩岸制度差異，及赴陸應注意可能風險。
陸委會稱，對於中共今天推出的相關同等待遇，政府相關單位仍將嚴肅看待，並進一步評估及妥慎應處；並呼籲中共官方具體落實對台商等台灣民眾的投資與生活具體保障。（編輯：賴言曦）1081104

The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council will bring another 26 to the Taiwan Affairs Council:

(Central News Agency reporter Shen Pengda, Taipei, 4th) The Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office announced today ""26 measures"" against Taiwan. The MAC said that the measure was an extension of the ""31 measures"" last year. The essence of ""named Huitai, Shishilizhong"" remains unchanged, and the government will take it seriously, evaluate it and take it seriously.
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly announced on the 4th ""Several measures to further promote cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation"", and proposed a total of 26 measures for Taiwanese enterprises and Taiwanese people.
The Continental Committee said in writing today that these measures were extended, changed, and packaged on the basis of the ""31 measures against Taiwan"" last year. The relevant content did not change the essence of ""named Huitai, but in fact, and benefited"". The political operation of one country, two systems is the two-pronged approach of the Beijing authorities to pressure the Taiwan political forces to threaten Taiwan to accept Taiwan’s one country, two systems. distance.
The MAC pointed out that the resumption of the so-called ""26 measures"" after more than a year on the other side only masked the fact that the ""31 measures"" were not implemented in the past year. It also reflected the downward pressure on the Chinese mainland and the coordination restrictions between various departments. Exaggerated, it is completely forbidden to test; it is a reflection of the Taiwan people’s refusal to ""one country, two systems"" and the disagreement with the CCP's united front.
The MAC said that the CCP’s attempt to promote Taiwan’s policy measures and to win over Taiwan’s intentions to divide Taiwan’s interior is even more evident in attempts to intervene in Taiwan’s elections.
The MAC said that since last year, the Government has continued to follow up and evaluate the ""31 measures"" and promote the strategy of ""strengthening Taiwan"", optimize the overall environment of Taiwan, and pay attention to the follow-up influence of the CCP as a platform, reminding the differences between the two sides of the Taiwanese system, and going to Lu should pay attention to possible risks.
The MAC said that for the relevant equal treatment introduced by the CCP today, the relevant government units will still take it seriously and further evaluate and take appropriate care of it; and appeal to the CCP officials to specifically implement the specific guarantees for investment and life of Taiwanese people such as Taiwanese businessmen.
