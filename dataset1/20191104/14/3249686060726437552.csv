RJ Winter Standing doll was also sold out first in many LINE FRIENDS stores according to customers who shopped at LINE FRIENDS stores today.



OP dropped by a LINE Friends store and was disappointed that RJ 'Rudolph' Winter Standing Doll & RJ Baby pouch were already sold out first.



RJ was selling out fast at Itaewon branch! You can see lack of RJ winter standing dolls & RJ baby pouches on the shelves.



As usual RJ enthusiasts have been raving about the sold out RJ issue on twitter:





















In conclusion, everyone needs at least one Rudolph RJ for this year's winter. No one can resist RJ's charms! All thanks to his creator BTS JIN
