《秘魯史》：日裔總統藤森謙也，如何拯救通膨2775.3％的崩潰國家？
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是藤森執政期間，雖然經濟表現亮眼，但多次宣布國家進入緊急狀態。在打擊國內游擊恐怖組織問題上，有濫殺無辜之嫌。藤森利用高壓手段控制言論、軍隊、警察乃至司法人員，也受到反對派強烈抨擊。



文：何國世
1990年秘魯的總統大選結果出乎政治觀察家的預期，一個在政治舞臺上沒沒無聞的日裔大學教授藤森，在第二輪票選中以超過20％的差距，擊敗他的對手、國際知名小說家瓦加斯（Mario Vargas Llosa），當選總統。他以鐵腕治國，執政長達十年，是拉美政治強人的典型代表。他還創造了許多第一：是西半球第一位亞裔總統；是秘魯第一位學者出身，沒有任何政治背景和從政經驗，在短短一年內組成政黨，並以絕對優勢擊敗似乎不可能擊敗的對手，登上總統寶座的總統；是拉美第一位三連任的民選總統；也是第一位在異國突然宣布辭職的總統。
在十年的執政期間，藤森取得了不少政績。首先，他對秘魯經濟發展功不可沒。藤森上臺時秘魯國內經濟形勢極度惡劣，經濟連續兩年負成長，1989年通貨膨脹率高達2775.3％，失業和半失業人數達66％，外匯儲備枯竭，還有二百三十億美元的外債。藤森上臺後，果斷地採取一系列改革措施，推行以遏止高通貨膨脹為中心的穩定經濟計畫。僅一年多，通貨膨脹率就降至4％，經濟成長2.4％。藤森執政期間，秘魯極端貧窮人口下降15％。整個1990年代，秘魯都保持了較高的經濟成長率。
其次，在打擊恐怖活動，穩定社會秩序方面頗有建樹。1992年，秘魯最大的反政府游擊隊「光明之路」和「圖帕克・阿馬魯革命運動」受到重創，其主要頭目相繼被捕，此後，這兩大恐怖組織趨於瓦解。1997年4月，藤森政府以武力救出被困在日本駐秘魯大使館人質。至此，猖獗一時的恐怖暴力活動逐漸消聲匿跡。最後，在外交方面，藤森以和平方式解決了秘魯與厄瓜多長年懸而未決的邊境糾紛問題，為拉美地區的穩定作出貢獻。
但是，藤森的鐵腕治國方式也引起了種種非議。在軍隊支持下，上臺不到兩年，藤森於1992年4月發動「自我政變」，史稱「四・五事件」，宣布中止憲法，解散國會，徹底改組司法機構，集行政、立法、司法三權於一身。1995年4月連任總統後，又強迫國會修改憲法，改變了以往憲法禁止總統連任的規定，以使他能參加2000年大選。藤森執政期間，多次宣布國家進入緊急狀態。在打擊國內游擊恐怖組織問題上，有濫殺無辜之嫌。藤森利用高壓手段控制言論、軍隊、警察乃至司法人員，也受到反對派強烈抨擊。
藤森的第一個五年執政（1990－1995）
1990年秘魯大選，雖然藤森沒有具體的施政政策，民眾也不清楚「誠信、科技、就業」競選口號的真正意涵，加上亞洲移民後裔不討喜的特殊身分，但是他不僅抓住了政治的大環境，運用的競選策略也獲得多數人的認同，最後終於登上總統寶座，展開長達十年之久的執政生涯。
分析其成功的因素，包括：首先，藤森以無黨無派形象作為訴求，對傳統政黨與傳統政治人物喪失信心的大多數選民而言，可謂另類清新形象。再者，藤森所訴求的對象不著重於特定族群或階級，而是全體選民。
其次，藤森在競選時從一般政治人物不願進入的貧民區展開活動，並承諾只要當選立即改善貧民的生活條件，這對處於城市邊緣人的貧苦階級而言，藤森出自基層、願意替貧民階級代言的親民形象與深具白人優越的對手瓦加斯有天壤之別。
第三，不具政黨背景的藤森並沒有強大的政黨機器可供其輔選，因此對於海岸區以外的廣大山區和雨林區則需要特別的人際網路來擴大他的知名度與選民對他的信賴感。藤森選擇的策略便是結合基督教會的力量打入鄉間。第四，藤森並未刻意地模糊本身的日裔血統，宣稱只要他當選，秘魯馬上可以獲得日本巨額的經濟援助來改善國家的經濟。最後，藤森運用農用曳引機拖著大型選舉廣告看板的另類宣傳方式，以增加民眾對他的認識度與提高在媒體曝光的機會。
此外，藤森的勝選也與憲法有關。秘魯1979年的憲法設計將總統塑造成國家希望的象徵，人民希望出現一位最能帶領秘魯的領導人，藤森因此被期待成為下一位真正的國家「拯救者」。1980年代所形成的經濟危機為新的民主政府製造了困境，大眾期望民主政府能實質改善環境，也期盼經濟利益可迅速從民主化中得到。在這種兩難的背景下，使得選民對沒有任何政治背景的藤森有特別的期待與付託，更為藤森創造了民意支持來進行個人對權力的獨攬與延續。於是藤森在1992年4月主導「自我政變」，重塑了秘魯政治架構和獨攬權力十年。
剛上任的藤森面臨的是一個即將崩潰的國家。1988年和1989年，秘魯的經濟已經出現8.8％和10.4％的負成長。作為執政黨的「改革90」是藤森在1990年為參加大選而組建的新黨，該黨在參議院六十個席次中只占十四席，眾議院一百八十個席次中僅占三十二席，力量薄弱。秘魯社會長期因貧困、不公平造成的社會動盪已到了相當嚴重的地步，恐怖主義分子到處製造流血事件。藤森在就職演說中也承認他接掌了一個「災難性的國家」，在這種情況下，藤森進行了大膽的改革。因此，秘魯的形勢在藤森歷經五年的治理後已明顯好轉：經濟趨於穩定；經濟由衰轉興；外交多元務實。但是仍面臨了一些問題。

經濟改革
1980年和1990年代交替之際，秘魯在經濟方面面臨兩大挑戰。首先，賈西亞政府將進口替代模式和擴大需求政策推向極端，使秘魯經濟陷入嚴重危機。通貨膨脹達四位數，生產急劇萎縮，經濟結構嚴重扭曲，恐怖主義活動進一步加劇了經濟的混亂狀況。其次，國際資本流向發生了重要變化。國際私人資本大量流向發展中國家，但是秘魯卻因經濟、政治和社會混亂以及賈西亞政府在外債問題上的強硬立場，被排除在國際金融體系的大門之外，難以利用國際資本流動帶來的經濟發展契機。
1990年藤森政府上臺後，面對上述兩個重大挑戰，他採取與國際金融機構積極合作的立場，制定和實施新自由主義的經濟穩定政策和結構改革計畫。
首先，從價格政策入手穩定經濟。因此，藤森政府一上臺便實施了一項緊急計畫，調整價格政策，取消對汽油、牛奶、麵包等基本消費品的價格補貼。同時，凍結工資，以避免出現工資和物價互相攀升的現象。另外，他也對低收入民眾進行補貼，緩和價格調整造成對社會的衝擊。
其次，藤森政府明瞭壓縮公共開支是反通貨膨脹成敗的關鍵，因此一上臺後便大幅削減公共開支並增加稅收。除取消價格補貼外，政府規定各部門財政預算一律削減10％。同時政府也自1992年起實施私有化政策以減少國營企業的虧損所帶來的財政赤字。另外，政府制定了新稅法，調整稅種和稅率，健全發票制度，成立專門稽查機構，以增加稅收，平衡財政收支。
第三，大規模實行私有化政策。除了大幅度削減國營企業虧損補貼，壓縮公共開支外，也透過拍賣國有企業，吸引外國投資。第四，政府委託中央銀行透過公開市場業務對匯率進行調節與干預，以避免匯率急劇浮動。第五，政府實行貿易開放，統一並大幅度降低關稅，取消非關稅壁壘。最後，藤森在上臺不久後即積極出訪各國，積極尋求與國際金融機構合作，大力吸引外資。
此外，這段時期秘魯的經濟改革與開放也呈現了以下的幾個特點。首先，經濟改革比較急、比較快，在價格和匯率的調整、貿易開放和私有化都比較突出地表現這一特點。其次，經濟改革更崇尚新自由主義。尊重市場機制，將政府的干預減少到最低限度。第三，經過1990年至1992年的政治動盪和政治力量的分化改組，藤森政府不僅獲得大部分民眾和軍隊的支持，而且成功的削弱傳統政治反對派的力量，藤森政權的基礎「改革90」在國會中占絕對多數。這為藤森政府進行經濟決策、經濟立法和推行改革政策，提供了有利的政治條件。經濟改革具有濃厚的民眾主義色彩，藤森政府把新自由主義與傳統的民眾主義結合。新自由主義經濟政策讓基層民眾的利益受到了最大的損害，但支持藤森經濟改革政策的力量在很大程度上，卻恰好來自廣大的基層民眾。這與他實施民眾主義不無關係。
經濟改革深刻影響了秘魯經濟發展的過程，比較急和比較快的改革措施與經濟政策，使得1990年至1996年的經濟發展出現相對應的三個階段：1990年至1992年的低成長階段；1993年至1995年上半年的高成長階段，以及1995年下半年至1996年的衰退和恢復成長階段。第一階段的低成長與政治及自然災害等因素有關，但與嚴厲經濟政策的衝擊也有很大的關係。在第二階段，經濟穩定，成長速度加快，1993年成長6.8％，1994年更高達12.9％，居世界首位。1994年經濟成長率超過秘魯的實際能力；產生經濟過熱現象，也因此造成經濟成長率由1995年第一季的12.2％下降到第四季的1％。隔年第一季出現負成長，第二季才又開始恢復成長。
在藤森執政的第一個五年，秘魯的經濟改革有了顯著的成效。通貨膨脹率由1990年的765％下降到1992年的57％和1995年的10％。公共財政收支實現了平衡，大型國有企業已拍賣近半，1996年外國實際投資額達五十六億美元，外匯儲備達八十五億美元，幾乎等於全年的進口費用。經濟顯著成長，1993年至1995年分別為6.8％、12.9％和6.9％。另外，在1991年至1994年間，由於經濟形勢的改善和政府的努力，失業率和貧困現象有所緩解，貧困人口占總人口的比重由54％下降為47％；極端貧困人口的比重由22％下降到19％。
自我政變
1990年藤森首任總統時，國內暴力猖獗、官員腐敗成風，人民怨聲載道，藤森採取了一些積極作為。首先，藤森認為，恐怖主義活動和官員的腐敗行為是阻礙改革順利進行的巨大障礙。他上臺後不久就制定了打擊恐怖主義活動和懲治腐敗的計畫，並得到軍隊和警察的大力支持。藤森針對日益惡化的政局，集中打擊危及社會安全的「光明之路」和「圖帕克・阿馬魯革命運動」極左游擊組織，1992年9月逮捕了「光明之路」首領古斯曼及他領導的成員。隨後，「圖帕克・阿馬魯革命運動」的領導核心成員也紛紛落網。藤森在經濟和反恐怖活動所獲致的成效更加樹立了他在民眾中的威信。
然而，隨著改革的深入，政府與國會之間的爭鬥也公開化了。由於執政黨「改革90」在議會中居少數，政府的行政權受到很大制約。議會又連續彈劾了農業與經濟部長，而且又公開否決或修改總統所提出關於懲處與毒品走私有牽連的政府官員的法律草案等一百二十多項法令的其中四十項。1992年更制定了《規範總統行為法》，使府會之爭發展到了不可調和的地步。因此，1992年4月5日在軍警的支持下發動了「自我政變」，解散議會，中止司法機構一切活動，為推行其各項改革掃除了障礙。與此同時，他大力整治腐敗，嚴懲以前總統賈西亞為首的一批貪官污吏。透過這些舉動，藤森逐漸控制了秘魯的政局，也樹立起他強人政治的形象。在當時的特定情況下，尤其是經濟長期無法擺脫危機的影響下，人們希望藤森政府能夠盡快穩定國內經濟情況恢復成長，並且對要推動的經濟改革寄予厚望，因此對藤森在政治上採取的強硬措施沒有表現出太大的抵制情緒，藤森政府也正是借助於對秘魯政局的控制，才能使經濟成長速度有所加快。
此外，藤森在第一個五年任期中也強行修改憲法，實行「強總統、弱議會」的體制。藤森透過修憲改變國家政體使「兩院制」變成「一院制」，並在新憲法中增修總統可「連選連任」的條文。在修憲的基礎上，他竭力擴大中央政府的權力，並新設「市政總署」以對地方政府進行監控。同時，他還重點打擊傳統政黨，削弱其勢力和影響，使得秘魯政黨體系在1990年代終遭土崩瓦解。藤森的地位逐步鞏固和強大，他的「改革90－新多數派」（Cambio90­Neuva Mayoría）已成為秘魯第一大勢力。
秘魯政壇在「自我政變」至1995年間的政治變化中已習得了兩項教訓。首先，他們認為唯有擁有「獨立派」政治色彩方能在1990年代的秘魯政壇中生存。試圖維護憲政秩序是無用的選舉策略，藤森在「自我政變」後的高民意支持似乎已證明了一切。其次，政治人物已不再需要政黨。融合個人化領導風格，以「拋棄式政黨」（註）與選民作為連結方式的「藤森主義」成為政壇上仿效的政治路線。政黨的角色已被反制度化、無任何意識型態、以公職候選人為軸心且以單一選舉為成立目的的「選舉機器」所取代，它與標榜「獨立派」的政治人物可以說是互為表裡的政治產物。至此，隨著「藤森式的民粹主義」的抬頭，秘魯的政黨體制可謂宣告崩解。
註：所謂「拋棄式政黨」是秘魯在1990年代所盛行的一種政黨運作模式。當時的候選人為選舉而成立政黨且將政黨定位為純粹的「選舉機器」，選舉結束後，該政黨也隨之消失。以藤森為例，在1990年代的歷次選舉中，他分別在1990年成立了「改革90」、1992年的「改革90－新多數派」、1998年的「鄰里並肩」以及2000年成立第四個競選組織「秘魯2000」，其他候選人也仿效成立類似組織，1990年代選舉機器在地方甚至中央的大小選舉中成為要局。

秘魯，這個孕育古印加帝國的國度，充滿著謎樣的氣息！
自遠古時期，秘魯因有安地斯山南北縱貫，地形險阻，但文明早已在此深根發展。十五世紀後，印加人在此建立了高度且燦爛的印加文明，他們崇拜太陽神、喜好收藏象徵太陽光芒的黃金，並以「太陽的子民」自居。然「黃金國」的傳說卻在十六世紀西班牙人登陸南美洲後，轉瞬間成為滅亡帝國的導火線。
西班牙人殖民秘魯長達三百多年，對秘魯的政治社會與文化風俗留下深刻的影響，致使十八世紀後已然獨立的秘魯，仍擺脫不了獨裁政治的控制。而今，政治貪汙腐敗、經濟產業衰退、國際紛爭不斷，祕魯該如何突破難關，就讓我們拭目以待。
本書將為你娓娓訴說秘魯的神話傳說、飲食文化、人文風情，同時也細數印加文明、西班牙殖民時期以及秘魯獨立建國以來，所歷經的政治、社會、經濟各方面的問題，帶你一窺秘魯的真實面貌。

""The History of Peru"": Japanese President Fujimori Ken also, how to save the collapsed country of 2775.3% inflation?
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that during the Fujimori administration, although the economic performance was bright, the country was repeatedly declared to be in a state of emergency. On the issue of cracking down on domestic guerrilla terrorist organizations, there is a suspicion of indiscriminate killing. Fujimori used high-pressure means to control speech, the army, the police, and even the judicial personnel, and was also strongly criticized by the opposition.



Text: He Guoshi
In 1990, Peru’s presidential election results were beyond the expectations of political observers. A Japanese-born university professor, Fujimori, who was not ignorant in the political arena, defeated his opponent, internationally known in the second round with a gap of more than 20%. The novelist Mario Vargas Llosa was elected president. He ruled the country with an iron fist and lasted for ten years. He is a typical representative of Latin American political powerhouses. He also created many firsts: the first Asian president in the Western Hemisphere; the first scholar in Peru, without any political background and political experience, forming a political party in just one year, and defeating with absolute advantage seems impossible The defeated opponent, the president of the presidency; the first three-elected presidential president of Latin America; and the first president who suddenly announced his resignation in a foreign country.
During the ten years of the administration, Fujimori achieved a lot of achievements. First of all, he contributed to the economic development of Peru. When Fujimori came to power, Peru’s domestic economic situation was extremely bad. The economy grew for two consecutive years. In 1989, the inflation rate reached 2775.3%, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people reached 66%, foreign exchange reserves dried up, and there were 23 billion US dollars in foreign debt. After Fujimori took office, he decisively adopted a series of reform measures to implement a stable economic plan centered on curbing high inflation. In just over a year, the inflation rate fell to 4% and the economy grew by 2.4%. During Fujimori's administration, the extremely poor population in Peru fell by 15%. Throughout the 1990s, Peru maintained a high rate of economic growth.
Secondly, it has made great achievements in combating terrorist activities and stabilizing social order. In 1992, Peru’s largest anti-government guerrillas, the “Glory Road” and the “Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement”, were hit hard and their main leaders were successively arrested. Since then, the two terrorist organizations have tended to collapse. In April 1997, the Fujimori government rescued the hostages trapped in the Japanese Embassy in Peru by force. At this point, the terrorist violence of the moment has gradually disappeared. Finally, on the diplomatic front, Fujimori peacefully resolved the long-standing unresolved border dispute between Peru and Ecuador and contributed to the stability of Latin America.
However, Fujimori’s iron fists have also caused various criticisms. With the support of the military, it took less than two years to go to power. Fujimori launched a ""self-coup"" in April 1992. It was called ""the Fourth and Fifth Incidents"". It announced the suspension of the constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, the complete restructuring of the judiciary, and the administration, legislation, and justice. Three powers in one. After re-electing the president in April 1995, he forced Congress to amend the constitution and changed the previous constitutional prohibition on the re-election of the president so that he could participate in the 2000 general election. During Fujimori's administration, the country was repeatedly declared to be in a state of emergency. On the issue of cracking down on domestic guerrilla terrorist organizations, there is a suspicion of indiscriminate killing. Fujimori used high-pressure means to control speech, the army, the police, and even the judicial personnel, and was also strongly criticized by the opposition.
Fujimori's first five years in power (1990-1995)
In the Peruvian general election in 1990, although Fujimori had no specific policy, the public did not know the true meaning of the campaign slogan ""Integrity, Technology, and Employment,"" and the special status of Asian immigrants who did not like it, but he not only seized politics. The big environment, the use of the campaign strategy has also been recognized by the majority, and finally reached the presidency, launched a decade-long ruling career.
The factors that analyze its success include: First, Fujimori’s appeal to the image of no party and no party is an alternative image to most voters who lose confidence in traditional political parties and traditional political figures. Moreover, Fujimori’s appeal does not focus on specific ethnic groups or classes, but on all voters.
Secondly, Fujimori campaigned from the slums that ordinary politicians were reluctant to enter during the campaign, and promised to improve the living conditions of the poor as soon as they were elected. For the poor class at the edge of the city, Fujimori is from the grassroots and is willing to serve the poor. The image of the pro-people endorsement is very different from the opponent of the white superiority of Vargas.
Third, Fujimori, who does not have a political party background, does not have a strong political party machine for its secondary elections. Therefore, for the vast mountainous and rainforest areas outside the coastal area, a special network is needed to expand his popularity and voters’ trust in him. . Fujimori’s strategy was to combine the power of the Christian Church into the country. Fourth, Fujimori did not deliberately blur his own Japanese descent, claiming that as long as he was elected, Peru would immediately receive Japan's huge economic assistance to improve the country's economy. Finally, Fujimori used agricultural traction machines to drag the alternative propaganda methods of large-scale election advertisement billboards to increase the public's awareness of him and improve the exposure in the media.
In addition, Fujimori’s victory is also related to the Constitution. Peru's 1979 constitutional design shaped the president into a symbol of national hope. The people hope to have a leader who can lead Peru best. Fujimori is therefore expected to become the next real ""savior"" of the country. The economic crisis formed in the 1980s created a dilemma for the new democratic government. The public expects that the democratic government can actually improve the environment, and expects that economic benefits can be quickly obtained from democratization. In this dilemma, voters have a special expectation and commitment to Fujimori without any political background, and Fujimori has created public support to carry out the individual's monopoly and continuation of power. So Fujimori dominated the ""self-coup"" in April 1992, reshaping the Peruvian political structure and the decade of power.
Fujimori, who just took office, is facing a country that is about to collapse. In 1988 and 1989, Peru’s economy had experienced negative growth of 8.8% and 10.4%. The ""Reform 90"" as the ruling party is the new party formed by Fujimori in 1990 to participate in the general election. The party only accounts for 14 seats in the 60 seats of the Senate, and only 32 of the 180 seats in the House of Representatives. Xi, the strength is weak. The long-term social unrest caused by poverty and injustice in Peruvian society has reached a very serious level, and terrorists are everywhere to create bloodshed. In his inaugural speech, Fujimori admitted that he had taken over a ""catastrophic country."" In this case, Fujimori made bold reforms. Therefore, the situation in Peru has clearly improved after Fujimori’s five years of governance: the economy has stabilized; the economy has changed from decline to the future; and diplomacy has become more pragmatic. But still face some problems.

Economic reform
On the occasion of the 1980s and 1990s, Peru faced two major economic challenges. First, the Government of Garcia pushed the import substitution model and the demand expansion policy to the extreme, putting the Peruvian economy into a serious crisis. Inflation has reached four digits, production has shrunk sharply, economic structure has been seriously distorted, and terrorist activities have further exacerbated economic chaos. Second, important changes have taken place in the flow of international capital. International private capital flows to developing countries in large numbers, but Peru is excluded from the door of the international financial system due to economic, political and social chaos and the hard-line position of the Government of Garcia on the external debt. It is difficult to use the flow of international capital. Economic development opportunities.
After the Fujimori government took office in 1990, faced with these two major challenges, he took the position of active cooperation with international financial institutions to formulate and implement neoliberal economic stability policies and structural reform plans.
First, start with a price policy to stabilize the economy. Therefore, the Fujimori government implemented an emergency plan to adjust the price policy and cancel the price subsidy for basic consumer goods such as gasoline, milk and bread. At the same time, wages are frozen to avoid the phenomenon of rising wages and prices. In addition, he also subsidized low-income people to ease the impact of price adjustments on society.
Secondly, the Fujimori government understands that reducing public spending is the key to the success of anti-inflation, so it will cut public spending and increase taxes once it comes to power. In addition to the cancellation of price subsidies, the government stipulates that all departments should reduce their budget by 10%. At the same time, the government has implemented a privatization policy since 1992 to reduce the fiscal deficit caused by the loss of state-owned enterprises. In addition, the government has enacted a new tax law, adjusted taxes and tax rates, improved the invoice system, and established special inspection agencies to increase taxes and balance fiscal revenues and expenditures.
Third, the privatization policy is implemented on a large scale. In addition to drastically reducing the loss subsidies of state-owned enterprises and reducing public expenditures, they also attract foreign investment by auctioning state-owned enterprises. Fourth, the government entrusted the central bank to regulate and intervene in the exchange rate through open market operations to avoid a sharp fluctuation in the exchange rate. Fifth, the government implements trade openness, unifies and substantially reduces tariffs, and eliminates non-tariff barriers. Finally, Fujimori actively visited countries soon after he took office, and actively sought to cooperate with international financial institutions to attract foreign investment.
In addition, Peru’s economic reforms and opening up during this period also showed the following characteristics. First of all, economic reforms are more urgent and faster, and they are more prominent in the adjustment of prices and exchange rates, trade openness and privatization. Second, economic reforms are more advocating neoliberalism. Respect the market mechanism and minimize government intervention. Third, after the political turmoil and the political reorganization of the 1990s and 1992, the Fujimori government not only won the support of the majority of the people and the military, but also successfully weakened the power of the traditional political opposition. The foundation of the Fujimori regime ""reform 90"" It has an absolute majority in Congress. This provides favorable political conditions for the Fujimori government to make economic decisions, economic legislation and implement reform policies. Economic reform has a strong populist color, and the Fujimori government combines neoliberalism with traditional populism. The neoliberal economic policy has greatly harmed the interests of the grassroots, but the power to support Fujimori's economic reform policy is, to a large extent, from the vast majority of grassroots. This has nothing to do with his implementation of populism.
Economic reform has profoundly affected the process of economic development in Peru. The more urgent and relatively quick reform measures and economic policies have brought about three corresponding stages of economic development from 1990 to 1996: the low growth stage from 1990 to 1992; The period of high growth from 1993 to the first half of 1995, and the recession and recovery period from the second half of 1995 to 1996. The low growth of the first stage is related to factors such as political and natural disasters, but it also has a lot to do with the impact of severe economic policies. In the second phase, the economy was stable and the growth rate accelerated. In 1993, it grew by 6.8%. In 1994, it reached 12.9%, ranking first in the world. In 1994, the economic growth rate exceeded the actual capacity of Peru; the economic overheating phenomenon also caused the economic growth rate to fall from 12.2% in the first quarter of 1995 to 1% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of the next year, there was negative growth, and the second season began to resume growth.
In the first five years of Fujimori's administration, Peru's economic reforms have achieved remarkable results. The inflation rate fell from 765% in 1990 to 57% in 1992 and 10% in 1995. Public finance revenues and expenditures have been balanced, and large state-owned enterprises have been auctioned for nearly half. In 1996, foreign actual investment reached 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange reserves reached 8.5 billion U.S. dollars, almost equal to the annual import costs. The economy grew significantly, from 6.8% to 12.9% and 6.9% from 1993 to 1995. In addition, between 1991 and 1994, due to the improvement of the economic situation and the efforts of the government, the unemployment rate and poverty have eased. The proportion of the poor population in the total population has dropped from 54% to 47%; the proportion of the extremely poor has been 22 % dropped to 19%.
Self-coup
In the first president of Fujimori in 1990, domestic violence and official corruption became the wind, and the people complained that Fujimori took some positive actions. First, Fujimori believes that terrorist activities and corrupt practices of officials are major obstacles to the smooth progress of reforms. Shortly after he took office, he set up plans to fight terrorism and punish corruption, and received strong support from the military and the police. In response to the deteriorating political situation, Fujimori concentrated on the ""Bright Road"" that threatened social security and the ""Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement"" extreme left guerrilla organization. In September 1992, he arrested Gusman, the leader of the ""Bright Road"" and him. Member of the leadership. Subsequently, the core members of the ""Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement"" were also arrested. Fujimori's achievements in economic and anti-terrorist activities have further established his prestige among the people.
However, as the reform deepened, the battle between the government and the Congress was also made public. Since the ruling party's ""reform 90"" is a minority in the parliament, the executive power of the government is greatly restricted. The parliament has successively impeached the Minister of Agriculture and Economy, and publicly vetoed or amended 40 of the more than 120 laws and regulations, such as the draft law proposed by the President on punishing government officials involved in the drug. In 1992, the ""Regulations on the Behavior of the President"" was enacted, and the dispute over the government was developed to an irreconcilable level. Therefore, on April 5, 1992, with the support of the military and police, a ""self-coup"" was launched, the parliament was dissolved, all activities of the judiciary were suspended, and obstacles were removed to implement its reforms. At the same time, he vigorously rectified corruption and severely punished a group of corrupt officials led by former President Garcia. Through these actions, Fujimori gradually controlled the political situation in Peru and also established his image of strongman politics. Under the specific circumstances of the time, especially under the influence of the long-term economic crisis, it is hoped that the Fujimori government will stabilize the domestic economic situation and resume growth as soon as possible, and have high hopes for the economic reforms to be promoted. Therefore, the political toughness of Fujimori is taken. The measures did not show much resistance. The Fujimori government is also relying on the control of the political situation in Peru to speed up the economic growth.
In addition, Fujimori also forcibly revised the constitution during the first five-year term and implemented the system of ""strong president and weak parliament."" Fujimori changed the state sect by changing the constitution to make the ""two-institutional system"" a ""one-house system"" and in the new constitution to add the provisions of the president's ""elect and re-election"". On the basis of constitutional amendments, he tried his best to expand the power of the central government and set up a new ""Ministry of Urban Services"" to monitor local governments. At the same time, he also focused on combating traditional political parties, weakening their influence and influence, and causing the Peruvian party system to collapse in the 1990s. Fujimori’s status has gradually consolidated and become strong. His “Reform 90-Neuva Mayoría” has become the largest force in Peru.
Peruvian politics has learned two lessons in the political changes from the ""self-coup"" to 1995. First, they believe that only having the ""independence"" political color can survive in the Peruvian politics of the 1990s. Trying to maintain constitutional order is a useless election strategy. Fujimori’s high public support after the ""self-coup"" seems to have proved everything. Second, political figures no longer need political parties. Incorporating a personal leadership style, ""Fuji-style"" with ""abandoned political parties"" and the electorate as a way of connecting has become a political line emulated in politics. The role of political parties has been replaced by anti-institutionalization, no ideology, ""electoral machines"" with public officials as the axis and a single election as the purpose of setting up. It can be said to be mutual with politicians who advertise ""independence"". For the political products in the table. So far, with the rise of ""Fengsen-style populism"", the political party system in Peru can be described as disintegrating.
Note: The so-called ""disposable political party"" is a model of political party operation that Peru prevailed in the 1990s. The candidate at the time set up a political party for the election and positioned the party as a pure ""election machine"". After the election, the party disappeared. Take Fujimori as an example. In the 1990s, he established the ""Reform 90"" in 1990, the ""Reform 90-New Major"" in 1992, the ""Neighborhood in the Neighborhood"" in 1998, and the fourth in 2000. The campaign organization ""Peru 2000"", other candidates also emulated the establishment of similar organizations, the election machines in the 1990s became the mainstay in local and even central elections.
