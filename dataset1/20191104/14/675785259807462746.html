      <h1>Jurgen Klopp responds to Pep Guardiola's 'diving' claim about Sadio Mane</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool boss was speaking ahead of his side taking on Genk in the Champions League on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:32:52+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has defended Liverpool star Sadio Mane after he was accused of diving by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Mane was booked for simulation in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, in which he scored a stoppage-time winner.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese has won penalties after being fouled in the Reds' recent home victories over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , and City boss Guardiola took a swipe at the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> man following his side's 2-1 win over the Saints on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Responding to his Mane's late winner, Guardiola said: "It's happened a lot for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the last years [scoring late on]. It's because he's a special talent.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes he's diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute. He's a talent.</p>
      <p>"If it's one time, two times, 'we were lucky, we were lucky', but it happened in the last two seasons many, many times – they have a special character to do that."</p>
      <p>City head to Anfield on Sunday in a battle of the Premier League's top two, but before that the pair have Champions League duties to attend to.</p>

      <p>Guardiola's side go to the San Siro to face Serie A outfit Atalanta, while Liverpool host Belgian side Genk at Anfield on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his press conference before that Genk clash, Klopp launched a defence of his forward.</p>
      <p>“Sadio is not a diver," he said. "Yes there was a situation in the Aston Villa game where he felt contact and went down.</p>

      <p>“Maybe it was not a penalty but there was contact.</p>
      <p>“It's not like he jumped over a leg or something. All the other penalties were penalties because he was there.</p>
      <p>“If something like that had happened for Manchester City I'm sure they would have wanted a penalty too.”</p>
