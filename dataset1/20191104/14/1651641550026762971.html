      <p>Microsoft announced their <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-announces-fluid-framework-at-build-2019/">Fluid Framework at Build 2019</a> and today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite">at Ignite</a> the company has announced a new Fluid Framework Public Preview for end-users and developers.</p>
      <p>Fluid Framework is a new technology and set of experiences that make collaboration seamless by breaking down the barriers between apps. It offers three key capabilities.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, experiences powered by the Fluid Framework will support multi-person coauthoring on web and document content at industry-leading speed and scale.</li>
        <li>Second, it provides a componentized document model that allows authors to deconstruct content into collaborative building blocks, use them across applications, and combine them in a new, more flexible kind of document.</li>
        <li>Third, the Fluid Framework makes room for intelligent agents to work alongside humans to translate text, fetch content, suggest edits, perform compliance checks, and more.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Over time, Microsoft expects these capabilities to come to apps acrossÂ  Microsoft 365, including within chat in Teams, mail in Outlook, portals in SharePoint, notes in OneNote, and documents in Office.</p>

      <p>For now, the Fluid Framework Public Preview end-user experience will be available publicly, and a private preview for developers, to help them be involved in the development of the technology.</p>
