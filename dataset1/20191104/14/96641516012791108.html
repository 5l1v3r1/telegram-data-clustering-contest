      <h1>Seth Meyers' Netflix special will have a button to skip Trump jokes</h1>
      <h2>The talk show host's stand-up set starts streaming Tuesday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:15:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>If you're a Seth Meyers fan who wants to catch the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/23/netflix-november-releases-irishman-queer-eye-the-crown/">talk show host's stand-up special</a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/whatsapp-netflix-trailers-watch-in-app/">Netflix</a>, you're likely fine with whatever gags it includes about Donald Trump. Meyers doesn't exactly lay off from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NedGGsT1GEA">making jokes about the president</a> on <i>Late Night with Seth Meyers,</i> after all. But if you're perhaps a little fatigued of such gags, you can skip the Trump-focused section of <i>Lobby Baby</i> with a dedicated button.</p>
      <p>It'll work similarly to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/18/chromecast-skip-show-introductions-netflix/">"Skip Intro"</a> or "Next Episode" prompts you already see on Netflix. Meyers, who brought the idea to Netflix, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">told</a> <i>CNN </i>the button is just "another joke in the special" and shouldn't be taken too seriously. In fact, he doesn't think many folks will actually use it.</p>
      <p>Netflix has tried out other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/13/netflix-tests-instant-replays-for-scenes/">interactive features</a>, such as with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/22/2019-emmy-awards/"><i>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</i></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/27/minecraft-story-mode-netflix/"><i>Minecraft: Story Mode</i></a> game. While the Trump joke button might not have quite the same level of complexity, it's a fun use of Netflix's tech that's unlikely to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/netflix-responds-variable-playback/">cause as much commotion</a> as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/25/netflix-variable-playback-android/">its test of variable playback speeds</a>.</p>
      <p>You'll be able to try the button when <i>Lobby Baby </i>hits Netflix Tuesday. More broadly, it's worth considering whether Netflix will adopt a "Skip Scene" button for other purposes. Earlier this year, it <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1116024755356749824">warned <i>Our Planet</i> viewers</a> about possibly upsetting scenes they might want to zip past. It's not impossible to imagine Netflix adding a button to skip potentially distressing sections of shows or movies.</p>
