Microsoft Azure Arc extends Azure management and security to any infrastructure including AWS
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Pradeep





During Ignite 2019 keynote, Microsoft revealed a new service called Azure Arc which extends Azure services and management to any infrastructure. Until now, Azure management only allowed customers to manage their Azure resources. With Azure Arc, you can now manage Linux and Windows servers, as well as Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud and edge. With Azure Arc, Azure management capabilities like Azure Resource Manager, Azure Shell, Azure Portal, API, and Azure Policy can now be used for any infrastructure.
Other highlights of Azure Arc:

With Azure Arc, developers can build containerized apps with the tools of their choice and IT teams can ensure that the apps are deployed, configured, and managed uniformly using GitOps-based configuration management.
Azure Arc makes it easier to implement cloud security across environments with centralized role-based access control and security policies.
With Azure Arc, customers can now realize the benefits of cloud innovation, including always up-to-date data capabilities, deployment in seconds (rather than hours), and dynamic scalability on any infrastructure.

Azure Arc is available today in preview.
