      <h1>UK to freeze in coldest November in nine years as -4C hits Guy Fawkes night</h1>
      <h2>Bonfire Night is predicted to be chilly this year as a Scandinavian shiver sends temperatures in the UK plummeting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:53:55+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Alistair Grant, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>This year's Bonfire Night is expected to be the coldest in almost a decade as a winter chill takes hold.</p>
      <p>After a weekend characterised by fearsome winds in the south and south west and clouds heavy with rain, temperatures are set to plummet.</p>
      <p>Firework fans are advised to wrap up warm on Tuesday, which could be the coldest Guy Fawkes Night in a decade as the mercury falls to a low of -4C.</p>
      <p>The 'Scandinavian shiver' is due to start tomorrow evening and then continue through much of November.</p>
      <p>For large parts of the UK the daytime maximum will be between 6 and 8C from Wednesday, with nights falling to -2C tomorrow night to -4C by the weekend.</p>
      <p>Computer forecast models point to this November being the coldest since 2010, The Weather Outlook reported.</p>

      <p>Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: "A much colder spell of weather arrives as cold air sinks down from Scandinavia and the Arctic from Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Wrap up warm for Bonfire Night and wear wellies. After recent rain, there's the risk of cancellations for events using parking on grass.</p>
      <p>“Tuesday night looks dry but frosty, with -2C lows in Scotland, with cold nights in the South as well later in the week and -4C possible.</p>

      <p>“Daytime temperatures will struggle to 6-8C for many this week, with midweek showers cold enough for snow in Scotland and to lower levels on Shetland, with 50mph gusts forecast in the South-West.</p>
      <p>“The pool of cold air stays with us and it looks like remaining on the cold side from the weekend onwards.”</p>
      <p>The chilly forecast follows this morning's warning that lots of rain is on the way.</p>

      <p>The cold snap follows on from a fearsomely windy weekend.</p>
      <p>A fierce storm hounded the lower parts of the country on Saturday morning, prompting the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> to issue a severe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning.</p>
      <p>Dozens of trees were felled in Cornwall and Devon by winds an independent weather station recorded as hitting 113mph, <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/hurricane-force-winds-batter-devon-3494633">Cornwall Live reported.</a></p>

      <p>Nick Hughes, who lives on a boat off Plymouth, said he recorded wind speeds of 64knots at 6.30am this morning, which according to the Beaufort Scale is hurricane-force.</p>
      <p>"I woke up at 5.30am this morning because my boat was nudging the pontoon," Nick, who has lived on boats for 11 years, said.</p>
      <p>"When I checked the wind speed it was 64.4knots. It was actually slightly higher at one point.</p>
      <p>"I've never known it to be this bad."</p>
