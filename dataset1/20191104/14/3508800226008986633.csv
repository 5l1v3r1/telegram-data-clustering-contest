《台灣史論叢 民間信仰篇》：代天巡狩——從道教到儒教的詮釋
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by 精選書摘


我們想讓你知道的是在信仰上單一神祇如馬巷池王爺，複數神祇則如五府千歲，不管其成神的神蹟有何差異，皆可聯繫台灣、東港與福州、泉州，在大歷史上的王爺神話現象，其中所銘刻的正是大航海時代的共同記憶。



文：李豐楙
【代巡東港：迎王巡境的隱喻】
（前略）
二、溫王爺、諸千歲與東隆宮的興建
（一）代天巡狩：從道教到儒教的詮釋
溫王與千歲神格的屬性及職司，為何都與「代天巡狩」相連結？首需理解東港人的在地觀點，即將活動性質稱為「祭典」，而選擇遺忘「王醮」或「瘟醮」的瘟疫記憶，乃是歷史記憶的常態。這些歷史都遺存於當地的神話版本中：其一東隆宮祭典委員會的祭典專輯所收錄的〈東港溫王爺傳〉，為廟方所認可的定本；其二則是地方人士吳朝進採錄的〈東港沿革與東隆宮溫王爺傳奇〉，在民國68年（1979）「以聖誥請示溫王爺示意准許」，即是經過神明恩准的神傳，將其定性為三十六進士系統。主要在區別於學界的瘟神說，如劉枝萬認為集體死亡乃瘟疫發生後大量的疫死現象，「係包括許多姓氏，形成雜姓群聚之複數神」。三十六進士即屬神話學的「36」聖數，使溫王與義結金蘭相連結，並方便代巡的輪值安排。借由敘述來強調因公而集體殉職，並以玉帝的敕封合理化「代天巡狩」的職稱。
對王爺神話的巡遊溺斃而後成神說，學界偏重集體的意外死亡，將其理解為怨靈、冤靈，而從儒家的祀典說加以解釋，既因奉旨出巡而遇難，乃屬因公、因職而死；雖屬非正常死亡，唯強調皇帝追封則屬正常處理：唐代貞觀皇帝（李世民）封為「代天巡狩」，並頒旨建廟春秋致祭，得有神位永享香火。依據《禮記．祭法》的祀典原則，既屬「以死勤事則祀之」即可歸屬「有功烈於民者」。
從「朝封制」襲用儒家義理，並引用泉州名人李光地（1642-1718）——福建安溪人，在朝為官時，「體念王爺在世豐功偉蹟，在神護國衛民之忠貞，啟奏聖祖康熙聖君，元旦朔日在金鑾殿御筆親賜加封溫王爺，敕封為護海王爺，永鎮東藩，保佑眾庶，巡查善惡，勸化人民向善，代天宣化，永享人間樂土。」又說三十六進士中有12人「授封准為欽點十二大巡每科主事」；因有功而由聖祖「御筆親臨，敕旨加封都察院兼辦理陰陽古御史王爵。」即想以朝封及賜額合理化其神格，其實忽略了「代天巡狩」的原意，乃屬「道封」下的瘟部，諸神職司「行瘟與解瘟」的雙重職責。
為什麼在當地會刻意強化「朝封」神話，其實關聯當地鸞堂中人進入內司團體，從而掌控了解釋權，這種文化既融合了儒宗神教，乃以儒家立場融合了三教教義，其中也就接受了道教的解脫觀，相信尸解成仙之說云：「據當時生還水手及侍從目睹，有聞仙樂飄奏，海上即時呈現一片祥雲紫氣，咸認溫鴻之死乃解脫而成神。」按照「解脫而成仙」的說法，既近於水解，乃道教三品仙說的下品尸解仙。既在海上罹難而尸解╱水解，而後玉皇大帝敕封成神，以此合理化「代天巡狩」之職。如果歸屬朝封，在歷代實錄、禮部祀典中為何缺少紀錄？這種矛盾在民間常被忽略，原因就在詮釋玉皇大帝的敕封，即將王爺廟命名「代天府」，或高掛所賜的「代天巡狩」匾額，這樣的象徵符號頗有一致性，其形成並非一時一地，亦非純屬閩地士人所改造，其真實的依據乃為「道封」體系，而後經由儒家士人根據禮經傳統而改造成功的。
證據就在道教的道經中，其神統譜中既有瘟部，就像星部（府）、土部（府）一樣，在宋元以來道教形成的「道封制」下，瘟部非僅瘟神一神而已，乃是統合了《洞淵神咒經》的洞淵天尊等與《女青鬼律》的五瘟主，後者即所謂行瘟的瘟神，都列在下半部，如五瘟、十二年王等瘟神疫鬼；而上半部職司解瘟之責的，就是洞淵天尊、匡阜真人等神。故瘟部兼具行瘟與解瘟的雙重性格，乃銘刻千餘年來的三個階段，不能僅僅採取「瘟神」的片面理解。
第一階段，六朝江南道教面臨瘟疫的流行，從「疫」字又新出「瘟」字，也就從古代疫鬼又衍生瘟神說，複合為瘟疫而有「天行」觀念。在此一關鍵階段出現在兩部道經：《女青鬼律》將天行瘟疫的懲罰觀，神格化為五瘟主：張元伯（春）、劉元達（夏）、趙公明（秋）、鍾士季（冬）、史文業（總）；《洞淵神咒經》構成神╱魔剋制說，神即指洞淵天尊，魔則泛指行瘟行疫的瘟神疫鬼，由洞淵天尊節制五瘟。從免疫學來看，北方人南下後，因為水土不服而致病；又適逢瘟疫流行的周期，當時曹丕曾有「疫氣」說，所反映的正是氣化論。可見行瘟、疫氣的天行觀，具體表現瘟疫的流行性質：猛爆性、集體性及懲罰性，此即本土流行病與宗教醫療的關係。
第二階段適當唐宋變革期，在宋元時期形成了瘟部說的道教體系，其中又出現了天符說，當時新法紛出亟需面對當時社會，瘟疫流行而變化劇烈，乃配合《天壇玉格》的受籙制，使道士擁有法官職牒的職責，而管制疫鬼既列入天律、鬼律。六朝期《女青鬼律》被擴大、改造為天律，稱為《太上混洞赤文女青詔書天律》，的確規範當境土地山神的職司之一，亟需追捉、申報境內瘟神疫鬼，凡瘟神附人均要呈報以便嚴懲。
其次一仍「鬼律」之名，饒洞天、鄧有功既編為《上清骨髓靈文鬼律》，同樣也是規範十二年王統隸諸天行疫疾，凡令人致病的瘟神疫鬼，即由法官遣驅邪院劄委土地、牒十二年王收回毒氣。第三部即鄭知微編、盧埜注《泰玄酆都黑律儀格》，名稱既改稱「黑律」，法官既有權力職掌酆都，也可斬除瘟神疫鬼、甚至滅形。當時的天律、鬼律、黑律既盛行一時，在律文中管制瘟神疫鬼，即反映此一時期瘟疫流行，為了滿足民眾集體的心理需求，乃賦予道士的法官之職，以期在驅瘟儀式中行法有效。
宋元時期神霄派所規範的制度，在江西一帶曾經施行，其中遺存於元末明初《道法會元》的，既有多種資料涉及遣瘟儀式：其一即〈神霄斷瘟大法〉，在主法中建立瘟部司的宗教威信，尊稱洞淵伏魔太一天尊、泗洲普照明覺禪師、瘟師主匡阜真人等，用以職掌剋制瘟疫神鬼之任：「惟願天符聖眾，咸依明覺之法言；瘟部諸神，亟奉洞淵之勑旨」；又首次出現了神船送王，在〈神霄遣瘟送船儀〉首次提出洛陽的帝都象徵：「逍遙徑返於洛陽，便是神王安穩處」、「張帆鼓浪，齊登焚岸之舟；擊節鳴鑼，快返洛陽之道」。既可送往海外蓬島，但關鍵仍在將神王送返洛陽，洛陽即帝都，神王、王神為諸王，此乃寓含諸王代天子巡狩已畢，即將歸返帝都完成述職之任。
可見此時道教既已模仿「代天巡狩」制，《洞淵神咒經》被神格化為洞淵天尊，作為解瘟者，所押走的行瘟者即天符使者、五瘟神及七十二候使者等。此乃目前所知最早的道教資料，而非屬朝封制下的祀典神，從天行、行瘟轉變為代天收瘟，基本上已經初步成形。故東港東隆宮舉行迎王的前一年，先要呈表玉皇大天尊，就遺存了道經的古例原意。
第三階段就是明清時期，民間既會組織五瘟社一類結社，而地方道壇則發展為完整的送船儀，長江流域及西南各省俱有。現在仍遺存於地方道壇的抄本中：如湖北使用的《正一收瘟安座玄科》、湖南湘西的民間打醮，江西則像吉安的喊船儀，而正一派祖廷龍虎山也刊行《和瘟酌餞科儀》等，均襲用宋元道經而予以地方化。其基本模式凡三：
（1）啟請瘟部諸神，同樣以洞淵天尊、匡阜先生、明覺禪師等置於前半部，作為解瘟諸神；而後半部則列出五瘟主、行瘟行者等；（2）陞壇行道、志心行禮，在科儀中將諸神統稱諸王、王神或神王及洛陽仙等；（3）送返之地，除了海島，洛陽普遍出現：「滿納祭祀登上花船，歸返洛陽別方行化」（湖北）；「便把此船送何處，一篙撐到洛陽關」（湖南）；「滿門王官何處去，直往洛陽大道中」（江西）；而龍虎山對外發行的和瘟版本則有一字之差，在「五湖四海皆湧水，奉送龍舟轉洛洋」寫作「洛洋」，這種改變非僅「洛陽」也將「大洋」兼括其中。
在目前資料尚不足的情況下，即可比對地方道壇的抄本，派別既多，數量龐大，但是從所引的數例，即可證明只要強化新說，將「洛陽」與「諸王」結合為一，只說送返而暗含迎迓，此一規制即是「迎王」與「送王」制，乃仿效王朝禮制所形成的體制：天子派遣諸王代為巡狩天下。從這些用語所獲得的代巡印象，這種觀念既普遍存在於地方道壇中，凡舉行送瘟╱送船儀即使用道經，均將代巡說凝固於「洛陽」象徵，從洛陽大道、洛陽關到洛陽仙俱有，故為江南社會所遺存的帝都象徵。
此乃緣於宋元時期人口南北移動增多，到了明清時期水陸交通稱便，從內地到海外越加發達，尤其沿海地區方便接觸海外，在大航海時代中傳染病發生後，不再限於長江流域一類內陸水域，反而是由沿海傳入內陸，隨著交通而流行的既廣又快。在這種情況下，將行瘟舊說融入新說中，雖未揭舉「代巡」之名卻行「代巡」之實，在明清時期甚至代巡海外，如鄭和下南洋、鄭成功代巡東寧（台灣），凡此種種均加速了改造的動力。
道教代巡說在福建發生的變化，特別值得研究瘟神信仰者注意，其中的關鍵在瘟部仍舊在「道封」體系下，縱使地方儒生參與且有主導性，也始終未能被改隸於「朝封」下；也就是所仿效的儀式，只是禮儀形式的巡狩禮制，而神格卻未曾列入敕封體制內。正因如此，禮生乃積極介入並主導儀式方式╱方向，在空間、整體規劃都取代了地方道士，後者則僅能維持其送瘟的專業，此一職能變化的明證，最早的紀錄即保存於福州地區，且是直接以信仰方式存在，此即當地盛行的五帝信仰，而其他的泉、漳二府則明確使用代天巡狩或王爺。其原始形貌早到何時？目前仍然難以證明，史料最早的見於海外散人《榕城紀聞》，既已記載五帝信仰，其形式已有「代天巡狩」的雛形，故其儀式可推到明末清初，因為出現崇禎15年（1642）的記事，只是並未標舉「代天巡狩」之名。
當地崇奉五帝的詳細情況，Michael A. Szonyi（宋怡明）在廣泛蒐集的資料中，關注福州地方官查禁「送五帝船」的數起事件，並據此評述五帝信仰乃「標準化的幻想」。五帝的神銜、職稱既未經朝封，儒家官僚即可借此為由要禁即禁，其實完全不能比擬天后賜封的「標準化」。乃因瘟部僅屬「道封」體系，自宋、明以來雖將道教隸屬於禮部下，禮部官員既不反對且默許，卻也未曾載諸歷朝的實錄中，故缺少朝封的祀典神紀錄；唯天師門下的地方道壇，則可根據道封行法，既可受籙為法官，且有天律、鬼律作為行法依據，因應地方社會的集體需求，彼此合作送船儀的舉行。此一制度存在著漏洞，使得地方官僚的處置有模糊性：若認為送五帝船的耗費大，即可視為迷信嚴加禁治；也可順應民意聽其循俗而行。
基於歷史上的這種兩可情況，即可知福州五帝為什麼屢禁屢興，而閩南地區則通稱五府千歲、或千歲、王爺，其實俱隸屬於「道封」下，既被歸屬於道教體系，故地方道壇一直祕傳其送王╱送船知識，而非禮生團體所期望的「朝封」體制，使地方官僚既可承認也可不承認，致使這種信仰處於游移狀態。道教內部既可依據傳承舉行醮儀，其儀式迄今不變，而地方儒士則面對選擇，其難題既可順應官方而加入反對之列，也可體察民意而選擇介入，福州即屬士人積極參與的案例，據此即可推知泉、漳二府無不俱然；在同一情況下，移民台灣之後各地也因應地方社會而自行調整，乃有南東港北西港的不同形式。

當初儒家士人何以會接受道教的代巡觀念？應該緣於實際的社會需求，既不欲退出就只能積極介入，關鍵在如何改變、改裝道教知識？乃將道教夙來的祕傳性，在某種程度上予以公開化；卻又基於五帝、王爺神格的威嚴，還是保存相當程度的神聖╱神祕性。如何將送船╱送王儀隱藏於王朝禮制下？其實文獻不足徵也，但唯一可以確定的，就是閩地形成送瘟儀的地方化，在於儒家的禮生扮演了關鍵角色，就是選擇可以利用的王朝禮制，其中巡狩禮從形式到內涵都方便仿效，乃將道教版本徹底改造為儒家版本。當地士人借五顯大帝、關帝作為掩飾，這樣的包裝形式雖未完全成功，當地官員仍然要禁即禁，卻將這種改造經驗傳布於閩地，既遺存於方志的記載中，都可見「代天巡狩」的祠廟與祭典，迄今仍保存於地方文物中，如莆田縣東汾村五帝廟正極殿所藏的〈五帝圖〉，也有正在恢復中的送船儀。
在閩、台兩地，尤其東港代表的屏東例，在形式上較為接近福州的早期形態，要點就在如何表現「代天巡狩」？台灣保存了許多遺跡：如代天府的名義、匾額上的「代天巡狩」四字。而在送船儀中，東港在王船寮的四圍既有燈籠，在王船的三座桅帆上則未標明，台南例亦然；但在閩地則不然，從早期的送船畫蹟迄今猶存，乃至目前恢復中的王船，船上無不標明「代天巡狩」字樣：既有主桅上的「代天巡狩」，也見於船沿上的立牌上；但是仍然遺存了道教的遺跡，就是前後桅上的「瘟部司」或「聖駕回鑾」字樣。在這種並存現象的背後，即銘刻「從道教到儒家╱儒教」的文化遺存；泉、漳州地區也在恢復中，同樣也一再出現這種情況。在信仰上單一神祇如馬巷池王爺，複數神祇則如五府千歲，不管其成神的神蹟有何差異，皆可聯繫台灣、東港與福州、泉州，在大歷史上的王爺神話現象，其中所銘刻的正是大航海時代的共同記憶。
從歷史所反映的閩、台王爺信仰，在儀式上是道士與禮生並存，主導力量雖有儒家╱儒教與道教的變化，涉及儀式詮釋權的偏重問題，其實面對的是同一事實：就是明清至近代的現實情況，在大航海時代既因貿易船進出，而傳染了外來可怕的流行病；其中最厲害的就是亞洲型霍亂的世界大流行（Asiatic cholera pandemic），乃起於印度而後隨著航運而傳染世界，其中一線即沿著海岸線向北，廣東、福建、台灣及浙江等俱在其中，且由此傳入內陸的廣大地區。
當時中醫稱為「痧症」等名，且認識到這一類瘟疫乃異於中土本有，而懷疑是「自䑲趕風來」的。在19世紀曾經有多次的世界大流行，魏嘉弘所採取的五期說：1817-1823、1826-1837、1846-1862、1864-1875、1883-1896，幾乎涵蓋了閩、台地區的數次大流行。由此始能解釋一些基本問題：在福州為什麼無法禁絕五帝船，甚至連知識分子也參與其中？乃因港口開通後帶來的傳染病，其流行之猛遠過於前，導致儒家士人身在其中而與時俱變，才會利用地方道壇的文化資源，在道經、儀式中代巡說的原有基礎上，改造為契合儒家巡狩禮制的新版本。
從福州乃至泉、漳二府所遺存的，比較東港的屏東例乃至台南例，同樣面對大航海時代的流行病傳染，在這種情況下有兩個決定性因素：（1）閩地既已改造完成的儀式形式，即儒家禮制與道教科儀並存，其差異僅輕重有別；（2）禮生與道士如何參與地方社會？共同面對類似亞洲型霍亂的大流行，甚至還有鼠疫、天花等，並非只有「風土病」的調適問題。
從東港的開發史，乃至台灣的移民開發，在共同面對同一地理環境的情況下，唯一的選擇就是襲用原鄉的模式，從形式到內涵俱然，都被用於解決現實的難題。從前後五期觀察台灣的亞洲型霍亂，其流行時間連貫清領與日治兩階段，甚至還跨入了戰後初期。從這種可以確定時間的流行病史，即可發現與送船儀的歷史幾乎重疊，除了日治期間曾經一度壓抑，在清領時期二者之間幾乎一致。故送船儀在台灣的歷史脈絡中，在信仰上既有習俗的例行意，在醫療上則有實際的現實意，此即在大歷史的觀察下，東港一地不能自外於這個命運共同體。
目前東港民間所認知的代巡千歲，不用瘟醮之名而只說「平安祭典」，其實並非就改寫了大歷史，此即所謂的「歷史記憶」；其中仍存在對瘟疫的恐懼經驗，只是事過境遷後選擇性的遺忘，故採用「祭典」而避忌「王醮╱瘟醮」。這就關聯儀式專家的問題，區內鸞堂獨盛而罕見道壇，早期雖會聘請道、法中人，且僅出現在送船的拍船儀，整個迎送儀式全為禮生團體所掌控。溫王與結拜金蘭的關係，既被合理化為三十六進士系統，既異於五帝系統，也有別於台南例，這些均僅屬名義、形式之異；其中的一致性仍在迎送五位千歲，且使用同一「代天巡狩」的名義，也就是均未曾脫離瘟部譜系，仍然兼具行瘟與解瘟之任。
故王爺神格既非溺斃的「怨靈」，亦非死不瞑目的「厲鬼」，而應該被界定為功烈神明，乃生前有功而死後成神，雖非朝封制下的祀典神，卻仍可理解為千歲代巡，而不宜單取其中一說，即難以解釋所有的例證，故根據比較觀點始可釐清此一複雜的信仰文化現象。

生活即文化，民間信仰活動是台灣社會生活與文化的重要成分，也是了解台灣社會組織、宗教信仰之歷史發展的重要切入點。
台灣民間信仰乃相對於制度性宗教（佛、道、基督教等）而言，或被視為具有擴散性宗教性質，主要源於傳統巫覡與鬼神信仰，同時混雜部分祖先、自然神崇拜與釋、儒、道成分，很難以「某某教」稱之，在進行繁複祭典時，通常需藉助道教各法派之科儀，故常見各地民間信仰宮廟加入各地道教協會為會員。
學界包括人類、歷史、文學、宗教、社會等學門，對民間信仰研究成果甚多，議題豐富，見解多元。本書所輯錄十篇論文涉及進香、建醮、祭祀與廟會等少數個案與議題，並輔以主編所撰導論，當有助讀者掌握台灣民間信仰之主要精髓。

""On the History of Taiwan's History, Folk Beliefs"": On behalf of Heaven and Hunting - Interpretation from Taoism to Confucianism
04 Nov 2019, 14:00 by Featured Book Picks


What we want you to know is that in the belief, a single god such as Ma Xiangchi, the plural gods, such as the five thousand years old, regardless of the difference in their miracles, can contact Taiwan, Donggang and Fuzhou, Quanzhou, in the big The mythical phenomenon of the king in history, which is engraved in the memory of the great maritime era.



Text: Li Fengqi
[On behalf of the East Port: the metaphor of the king's patrol]
(previously omitted)
2. Construction of Wen Wangye, Chitose and Donglong Palace
(1) Touring on behalf of Heaven: Interpretation from Taoism to Confucianism
Why do the attributes and functions of Wen Wang and Chitose are linked to the ""Days of Heaven""? First, we need to understand the local people's point of view. The nature of the event is called ""the ritual"". The choice of forgetting the memory of the plague of ""Wang Yu"" or ""瘟醮"" is the normal state of historical memory. These histories are in the local mythological version: the ""Donggang Wenwangye Biography"" included in the ceremonial album of the Donglong Palace Festival Committee, which is approved by the temple side; the second is the local port of Wu Chaojin. History and the legend of the Tonkin Palace Wen Wangye, in the 68th year of the Republic of China (1979), ""When the Holy Grail asked the Wen Wang to give permission,"" it was the god of the gods, and it was characterized as the thirty-six scholar system. The main reason is that the gods who are different from the academic circles say that if Liu Zhiwan thinks that collective death is a large number of epidemic deaths after the plague, ""the system includes many surnames, forming the plural gods of the mixed population."" Thirty-six scholars are the ""36"" holy numbers of mythology, which connects Wen Wang with the knot of Jin Lan and facilitates the rotation of the tour. By narration, it emphasizes the collective dereliction of duty due to the public, and rationalizes the title of ""Daily Tournament"" with the seal of the Jade Emperor.
After the parade of Wang Ye’s mythology, he became a god and said that the academic circles were biased towards the collective death of the collective, and they were interpreted as grievances and spirits, and they were explained from the Confucian classics, and they were killed because of the purpose of the tour. Death due to duty; although it is an abnormal death, only emphasizing the emperor's seal is a normal treatment: the Emperor of the Tang Dynasty (Li Shimin) was named as ""the heavenly patrol"", and the purpose of the temple was to pay for the spring and autumn. A place to enjoy incense. According to ""Book of Rites. The principle of the sacred law of the Sacrificial Law is that it can be attributed to ""there are merits and demerits"".
From the ""searing system"" to the Confucianism, and quoted Quanzhou celebrity Li Guangdi (1642-1718) - Anxi people in Fujian, when the DPRK was an official, ""the body of the dynasty in the world, the loyalty of the gods in the country, He played the holy sacred Kangxi Shengjun, and the New Year's Day was given to the King of the Golden Temple in the Golden Temple. He was the guardian of the sea, the east of Yongzhen, the blessing of the public, the inspection of good and evil, the persuasion of the people to the good, the day of Xuanhua, and the enjoyment of the world. It is said that 12 of the 36 scholars have been awarded the title of ""Twelve patrols of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sacred priests"" ""You want to rationalize your godhead with the seal and the amount of the donation. In fact, the original meaning of ""daily hunting"" is neglected. It is the cadre under the ""Taofeng"", and the priests of the priests are ""doubled and relieved"". Duties.
Why is it that the local mythology is deliberately strengthened in the local area? In fact, the people in the local ancestral halls are involved in the inner divisions, thus controlling the right to interpret. This culture combines the Confucianism and the Confucianism. It also accepts the Taoist liberation view, and believes that the corpse is a fairy saying: ""According to the survivors of the sailors and the attendants at the time, there was a sensation of the music, and the sea immediately showed a cloud of auspicious clouds, and the death of Wen Hong was liberated. Become a god."" According to the ""freedom to become a fairy"", it is close to hydrolysis, and it is the corpse of the Taoist Sanpinxian. Both the martyrdom and the corpse were hydrolyzed at the sea, and then the Jade Emperor was sealed into a god to rationalize the position of ""day hunting."" If there is a vesting in the seal, why is there a record in the records of the dynasties and the rituals of the rites? This kind of contradiction is often neglected in the people. The reason is to interpret the seal of the Jade Emperor, the name of the ""Ya Tianfu"", or the ""Days of Heaven"", which is given by Gao Hang. This symbol is quite consistent. The formation is not a one-time place, nor is it purely a transformation of the landlords. The real basis is the ""daofeng"" system, which was then successfully transformed by Confucian scholars according to the tradition of etiquette.
The evidence is in the Daoist Taoist Taoism. There are both cadres in the sect of Taoism. Just like the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects of the sects It is not only a god, but a combination of the ""Dong Yuan Shen Man Jing"" and the five lords of ""The Green Ghost Law"", the latter, the so-called blasphemy, are listed in the lower half, such as The five-year-old and the twelve-year-old king are blasphemy gods; and the responsibilities of the first half of the division are the cave gods, the gods, and the real people. Therefore, the cadre has both the characteristics of behavior and dispelling. It is the three stages that have been engraved for more than a thousand years. It is not just a one-sided understanding of ""God"".
In the first stage, the Jiangnan Taoism in the Six Dynasties faced the plague epidemic, and the word ""瘟"" was newly created from the word ""epidemic"". It was also derived from the ancient epidemic ghosts, and it was said that the plague was combined with the concept of ""day trip"". At this critical stage, there are two passages: ""The Female Green Ghost Law"" will punish the plague of the plague, and transform it into five lords: Zhang Yuanbo (Spring), Liu Yuanda (Summer), Zhao Gongming (Autumn), Zhong Shiji (Winter), Shi Wenye (total); ""Dong Yuan Shen Man Jing"" constitutes the gods and sorcerer, ""God refers to the cave god Tianzun, and the magic refers to the sacred plague of the plague."" From the point of view of immunology, after the northerners went south, they became sick because of the lack of water and soil. They also met the cycle of plague epidemic. At that time, Cao Yu had an ""epidemic"" saying that it was the theory of gasification. It can be seen that the behavior of the plague and the epidemic is concrete. It shows the epidemic nature of the plague: violent, collective and punitive. This is the relationship between local epidemics and religious health.
In the second phase of the Tang and Song Dynasties, during the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the Taoist system of the Ministry of Education was formed. Among them, Tian Fu said that the new law was in need of confrontation with the society at that time, and the plague became more and more dramatic. The temperance of the Temple of Heaven Yuge makes the Taoist priests have the duties of judges, and the control of the plague is included in the law of the heavens and the law of the ghosts. The Sixth Dynasty ""Female Green Ghost Law"" was expanded and transformed into a law of the heavens. It is called ""Tai Shang Mixing Cave Red Women's Book of Qing Dynasty"", which does regulate one of the functions of the land gods of the land, and needs to be pursued and declared. In the territory of the blasphemy, all the sacred gods must be reported for severe punishment.
The second is still the name of ""Ghost Law"". Rao Dongtian and Deng Yougong are both compiled as ""The Ghosts of the Ming Dynasty"", which is also the standard of the 12-year-old Wang Tong. The epidemic ghost, that is, the judge repatriated the land of the sect of the evil sect, and the king of the scorpion recovered the poison gas. The third part is Zheng Zhiwei and Lu Ye's ""Tai Xuan's Black Law"". The name is changed to ""Black Law"". The judge has both power and power, and can also eliminate the evil spirits and even destroy the shape. At that time, the law of the heavens, the law of the ghosts, and the black law were prevailing. The control of the plagues in the law reflected the plague epidemic in this period. In order to satisfy the collective psychological needs of the people, it was the judge of the Taoist priests. The law is effective.
In the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the system regulated by the gods was implemented in the area of Jiangxi. The remains of the Taoist dynasty in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties included a variety of materials related to the ritual: the first one was the sacred sect 〉In the main law, the establishment of the religious prestige of the Department of the Ministry of the Ministry of the People’s Republic of China, the honour of the sacred priests, the sacred sorcerer, the sect of the sect of the sect of the plague The celestial sacred sage, the sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred The emperor symbolizes: ""The return to Luoyang is the stability of the king of the gods"", ""Zhang Fan Gulang, Qi Deng's boat on the shore; hit the festival and sing, return to Luoyang."" It can be sent to Pengmao overseas, but the key is still to send the god king back to Luoyang, Luoyang is the emperor, the god king, the king god is the king, this is the king of the emperor, and the emperor has completed the tour, and will return to the emperor to complete the debriefing. Ren.
It can be seen that Taoism has already imitated the ""Daily Heaven Hunting"" system, and the ""Dong Yuan Shen Man Jing"" has been turned into a sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sect. Seventy-two waitingers and so on. This is the earliest known Taoist material, rather than the dynasty god under the circumstance of the dynasty. It has basically taken shape from the transformation of the heavens and the shackles to the replacement of the heavens. Therefore, the Donggang Palace in Donggang held the first year of the welcoming of the king, first of all to present the Jade Emperor Tianzun, and left the ancient example of the Tao.
The third stage is the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The folks will not only organize the association of the Wuyi Society, but the local Taoist temple will develop into a complete ship-ship instrument, which is available in the Yangtze River Basin and the southwestern provinces. It is still in the transcripts of the local Taoist temple: for example, the “Zhengyi’s Emperor Xuanke” used in Hubei and the folk snoring in Hunan’s Xiangxi, Jiangxi is like Ji’an’s shouting instrument, and the ancestral ancestral ancestral dragon and tiger mountain is also published. ""And discretion, science and technology"", etc., were all localized using the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Its basic model is three:
(1) Inviting the cadres of the cadres, and also placing them in the first half as the sacred gods, as well as the sacred gods; and the latter half lists the five lords and the stalkers; (2) Ascending the altar and motivating the rituals, in the ceremonial ceremonies, the gods are collectively called the kings, the kings or the gods and the Luoyang sects; (3) the place of return, in addition to the island, Luoyang generally appears: ""Manchu rituals Boarding the flower boat and returning to Luoyang to behave in a different way"" (Hubei); ""Where will the boat be sent to Luoyang Pass"" (Hunan); ""Where is the official of the gate, go straight to Luoyang Avenue"" ( Jiangxi); and the version of Hessian and Hushan issued by the Dragon and Tiger Mountain has a word difference. It is written in ""Luoyang"" in the ""five lakes and four seas, and the dragon boat is turned to Luoyang."" This change is not only ""Luoyang"" but also ""Ocean"". Also included.
In the current situation where the information is still insufficient, the transcripts of the local Taoist altar can be compared. There are many factions and a large number of factions. However, from the cited cases, it can be proved that as long as the new theory is strengthened, ""Luoyang"" and ""Kings"" will be combined. For one, it is only said that the return is implied. This regulation is the ""Welcome to the King"" and the ""Send the King"" system. It is a system formed by the emperor's ritual system: the emperor sent the kings to patrol the world. From the use of these terms, the concept of the patrol tour is not only common in the local Taoist altar, but the use of the Taoist ceremonies when the ship is sent to the ship, all of which will be condensed in the ""Luoyang"" symbol, from Luoyang Avenue. Luoyang Guan has a place in Luoyang, so it is the symbol of the imperial capital left by the Jiangnan society.
This was due to the increase in the north-south movement of the population during the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the water and land transportation was convenient, and it was more developed from the mainland to overseas. Especially in the coastal areas, it was convenient to contact overseas. After the infectious disease occurred in the era of great navigation, it was no longer limited to the Yangtze River. Inland waters, such as river basins, are instead inland from the coast, and are popular and popular with traffic. Under this circumstance, the old sayings are incorporated into the new saying. Although the name of ""deputy tour"" has not been revealed, the ""deployment tour"" has been carried out. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, even overseas patrols, such as Zheng He Xia Nanyang and Zheng Chenggong. On behalf of Dongning (Taiwan), all of these have accelerated the power of transformation.
The Taoist patrols said that the changes in Fujian are particularly worthy of studying the attention of the devotees. The key point is that the cadres are still under the ""Daofeng"" system. Even though the local Confucian students are involved and dominant, they have not been reinstated. Under the ""Four Seals""; that is, the rituals that are emulated are only the ceremonial form of the ritual ritual system, but the gods have not been included in the shackle system. For this reason, Lisheng is actively intervening and leading the way of rituals, replacing local Taoist priests in space and overall planning, while the latter can only maintain the professionalism of its essays. The proof of this function change, the earliest record is saved. In the Fuzhou area, it is directly in the form of faith, which is the prevailing belief of the Five Emperors in the local area, while the other springs and ancestors are clearly using the Tiantian patrol or the prince. When is its original appearance early? At present, it is still difficult to prove that the earliest historical materials were found in the overseas scattered people, ""Yucheng Jiwen"", which has already recorded the five emperors' beliefs, and its form has the prototype of ""daily hunting"", so its ritual can be pushed to the late Ming and early Qing dynasties because of Chongzhen’s 15 years (1642) note, but did not label the name ""Daitian Tournament"".
In the extensively collected information of the five emperors, Michael A. Szonyi (Song Yiming) paid attention to the several incidents in which Fuzhou local officials banned the ""send five emperors"" in the widely collected materials, and based on this, the five emperors' beliefs were ""standardized fantasy."" The title and title of the Five Emperors were not sealed by the DPRK, and the Confucian bureaucrats could use this as a reason to ban them. In fact, they could not compare the ""standardization"" of the Tianhou. Because the cadres are only the ""Daofeng"" system, since the Song and Ming dynasties, Taoism was subordinated to the Ministry of Rites, and the officials of the Ministry of Rites did not object or acquiesce, but they did not contain the records of the dynasties, so they lacked the seal of the dynasty. The record of the gods; the local Taoist altar under the Tianshi division can be regarded as a judge according to the Daofeng method, and there is a law and a ghost law as the basis of the law. In response to the collective needs of the local society, they can cooperate with each other. The ship's instrument is held. There are loopholes in this system, which makes the handling of local bureaucrats ambiguous: if it is considered that the cost of sending the five emperors is large, it can be regarded as superstitious and strictly prohibited; it can also be followed in accordance with the public opinion.
Based on the historical situation, we can see why the Five Emperors of Fuzhou have repeatedly banned, and the southern part of the country is known as the Chi-Chi, Chitose, or Chitose. In fact, they belong to the ""Tao Feng"" and are attributed to the Taoist system. Therefore, the local Taoist altar has been secretly rumored to send Wang Chuan to send ship knowledge, rather than the ""Chaofeng"" system that the Libyan group expects, so that the local bureaucrats can neither recognize nor recognize, and this belief is in a state of migration. Taoism can be held inside the funeral according to the inheritance. The ceremony has not changed until now, and the local Confucianists are faced with choices. The problems can be complied with by the official and joined the opposition. They can also observe the public opinion and choose to intervene. Fuzhou is a scholar. The cases of active participation can be inferred from the fact that Quanquan and Shufu are all in one place. Under the same circumstances, after immigration to Taiwan, the localities have adjusted themselves according to the local society. There are different forms of the South West Port and the North West Port.

Why did Confucian scholars accept the concept of Taoist patrol? It should be due to actual social needs. If you do not want to withdraw, you can only actively intervene. The key is how to change and modify Taoist knowledge. It is the esoteric nature of Taoism that has been made public to some extent; but it is based on the majesty of the five emperors and the princes of the princes, and it still preserves a considerable degree of sacred mystery. How to send the ship to Wang Yi hidden under the dynasty ceremony? In fact, the literature is not enough, but the only thing that can be determined is that the localization of the shackles is formed. It is the role of the rituals of Confucianism. It is the choice of the ritual system that can be used, from the form to the connotation. It is convenient to emulate, which is to completely transform the Taoist version into a Confucian version. The local scholars used the five major emperors and the Guandi as a cover. Although the packaging form was not completely successful, local officials still had to ban the ban, but they spread the experience of this transformation to the depression, which was left in the records of the local records. It can be seen that the temples and ceremonies of the ""Days of Heaven"" are still preserved in local cultural relics, such as the ""Five Emperors"" in the Zhengdian Temple of the Wudi Temple in Dongpu Village, Putian County, and there are also shiplifting instruments in recovery.
In the two places of Fujian and Taiwan, especially the Dongkang representative, the form is closer to the early form of Fuzhou, and the key point is how to express the ""day trip"". Taiwan has preserved many relics: in the name of Dai Tianfu, the word ""daily patrol"" on the plaque. In the ship-ship instrument, Donggang has lanterns around the ship's boat, but it is not marked on the three sails of the king ship, and the case of Tainan is also the case; but in the depression, it is not the case. The ship that has survived to this day, and even the restored king ship, all the words on the ship are marked with the words ""Days of Heaven and Hunting"": both the ""Days of Heaven and Hunting"" on the main squad, and also on the board on the ship's edge; but still remains. The relics of Taoism are the words ""瘟部司"" or ""圣驾回銮"" on the front and back. Behind this coexistence phenomenon, the cultural relics of ""From Taoism to Confucianism and Confucianism"" are inscribed; the springs and the Quzhou area are also recovering, and this has also occurred repeatedly. In the belief, a single god, such as Ma Xiangchi, the prince, the plural gods, such as the five thousand years old, regardless of the difference in their miracles, can contact Taiwan, Donggang and Fuzhou, Quanzhou, in the history of the king of myth, What is engraved is the common memory of the great maritime era.
From the history, the beliefs of the princes and the princes of Taiwan are coexisting in the rituals. Although the dominant forces have changes in Confucianism and Taoism, and the emphasis on the right to ritual interpretation, in fact, the same fact is faced: The reality from the Ming and Qing Dynasties to the modern times, in the era of great voyages, was caused by trade ships entering and exiting, and it has infected foreign terrible epidemics; the most powerful of these is the Asian cholera pandemic, which originated in India. With the spread of shipping, the first line is north along the coastline, with Guangdong, Fujian, Taiwan, and Zhejiang all in it, and it is introduced into vast areas of the interior.
At that time, Chinese medicine was called ""sickness"" and recognized that this type of plague was different from that of the Middle Kingdom, and the suspicion was ""self-satisfaction."" In the 19th century, there were many world pandemics. The five issues adopted by Wei Jiahong said: 1817-823, 1826-1837, 1846-1862, 1864-1875, 1883-1896, which almost covered the number of the Yunnan and Taiwan regions. The second epidemic. From this, I can explain some basic questions: Why can't the five emperors be banned in Fuzhou, and even intellectuals are involved? Because of the infectious diseases brought about by the opening of the port, the popularity of the epidemic is too far, leading the Confucian scholars to change with the times, and they will use the cultural resources of the local Taoist altar to patrol the Taoist and rituals. On the basis of the original, it was transformed into a new version that fits the Confucian patrol ceremony.
From the remains of Fuzhou and even the spring and the second government, comparing the Pingtung case of Donggang to the case of Tainan, it also faces the epidemic infection in the era of great navigation. In this case, there are two decisive factors: (1) The ritual form that has been reconstructed, that is, the Confucian ritual system and the Taoist science and technology coexist, the difference is only different; (2) How do the rites and priests participate in the local society? Faced with a pandemic similar to Asian cholera, and even plague, smallpox, etc., it is not only the adjustment problem of ""land disease"".
From the development history of Donggang and even the development of immigration in Taiwan, the only choice is to use the same pattern of the original geographical environment. From the form to the connotation, it is used to solve the real problems. From the five periods before and after the observation of Taiwan's Asian cholera, its popular time was consistent with the two stages of clearing and Japanese governance, and even entered the early postwar period. From this epidemiological history that can determine the time, it can be found that the history of the ship-lifting instrument almost overlaps, except that it was once suppressed during the Japanese occupation, and almost identical between the two during the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, in the historical context of Taiwan, the ship-ship instrument has both the customary meaning of custom in the faith and the practical reality in the medical field. Under the observation of the great history, the East and the West cannot be outside this fate. community.
At present, the Dongkang folks know that the maiden voyage is thousands of years old. It is not a name for the ""Peace Festival"". It is not a rewriting of a big history. This is the so-called ""historical memory"". There is still a fear experience of the plague, but only After the event has been moved, the selective forgetting, so the use of ""ceremonies"" and avoiding ""Wang Yu"". This is related to the issue of ritual experts. The area is unique and rare. In the early days, although the Taoist and French-Chinese people were hired, and only appeared in the ship’s boating instrument, the whole welcoming ceremony was all for the ritual group. Take control. The relationship between Wen Wang and the worship of Jin Lan has been rationalized into a system of thirty-six scholars, which is different from the five emperor system and the Tainan case. These are only nominal and formal differences; the consistency is still welcoming five Chitose, and using the same ""day-to-day patrol"", that is, they have never left the cadre, and still have the responsibility of doing business and solving problems.
Therefore, the prince of the prince is neither a blasphemy of ""wailfulness"" nor a ""ghost"" of death. It should be defined as a martial god. It is a god before the death and is a god after the death. It can be understood that it is a thousand-year-old patrol, and it is not appropriate to take one of them. It is difficult to explain all the examples. Therefore, according to the comparative point of view, this complex belief culture phenomenon can be clarified.

Life is culture, and folk belief activities are an important component of Taiwan's social life and culture. They are also an important entry point for understanding the historical development of Taiwan's social organizations and religious beliefs.
Taiwan's folk beliefs are relative to institutional religions (Buddha, Taoism, Christianity, etc.), or are considered to be of a diffuse religious nature, mainly derived from traditional witchcraft and ghosts and gods, and mixed with some ancestors, natural god worship and interpretation. The Confucianism and Taoism are difficult to call ""teachers"". In the case of complex festivals, it is usually necessary to use the various schools of Taoism. Therefore, the folk belief temples in various places have joined the Taoist Associations as members.
The academic world includes humanities, history, literature, religion, and society. There are many research results on folk beliefs, rich topics, and diverse opinions. The ten papers in this book cover a few cases and topics such as Jinxiang, Jianye, Sacrifice and Temple Fair, supplemented by the editor-in-chief, which helps readers master the main essence of Taiwanese folk beliefs.
