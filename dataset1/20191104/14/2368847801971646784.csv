巴黎大師賽：德約科維奇奪冠仍失球王寶座

04 Nov 2019, 14:16

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】當地時間11月3日，巴黎網球大師賽男單決賽中，頭號種子德約科維奇（Novak Djokovic）以6-3/6-4擊敗了加拿大新星沙波瓦諾夫（Denis Shapovalov）奪冠。即使這樣。塞爾維亞球王也未能保住自己的球王寶座，在半決賽傷退的西班牙球王納達爾將重返世界第一。
巴黎大師賽之初，德約科維奇患上感冒，但是隨著比賽進行，他的狀態逐漸恢復，一路過關斬將，連續第二年進入決賽；20歲的沙波瓦洛夫則在半決賽收到了納達爾的退賽「大禮」，得以晉級。此前，兩人有過三次交手，全部在今年，小德保持全勝。
首盤，德約科維奇一上來就破掉了沙波瓦洛夫的發球局，取得3-0領先。此後，加拿大小將狀態有所提升，但小德沒有送出破發點，順利保發，以6-3先下一城。
次盤開局，雙方各自保發，戰至3-3平。第7局，沙波瓦洛夫失誤增多，小德破發。第8局小德在自己首個破發點上，化解危機保發。最終，德約科維奇以6-4贏得勝利，成就巴黎賽「五冠王」。
這是塞爾維亞人今年第5冠、生涯第77冠，也是他第34個大師賽冠軍，僅次於納達爾的35個。在最新世界排名榜上，由於德約科維奇要扣除了去年總決賽亞軍的1000分積分，他的冠軍積分為8945分，落後納達爾640分，排名跌至第二；而去年沒有參加巴黎大師賽和年終總決賽的納達爾，將時隔一年，重返時間第一。
在半決賽退賽後，納達爾表示：「我感覺到腹肌不適，如果貿然參賽的話，可能會加重傷勢，醫生建議我放棄比賽。」對於接下來的倫敦ATP年終總決賽，他表示會盡一切可能做好準備，但目前還無法確定是否參賽。
