      <p>A man who was caught with heroin in Belfast after getting off a bus from Dublin has been given an 18-month sentence.</p>
      <p>Nerijius Kazlauskas, who turns 49 tomorrow and whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry, was told his sentence was split between nine months in custody and nine months on licence.</p>
      <p>Due to time already served, the Lithuanian national is due to be released from prison this week.</p>
      <p>Belfast Crown Court heard that Kazlauskas and a second man were stopped getting off a bus from Dublin at Glengall Street bus station on the evening of October 21 last year.</p>
      <p>Both men were searched, and around eight grams of heroin was found in the lining of Kazlauskas's coat. The pair were also found to be in possession of Xanax tablets.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Rosemary Walsh confirmed the second man has not been sentenced yet and will be appearing in court at a later date.</p>
      <p>She also said that when arrested and charged with importing drugs, Kazlauskas told police he was a regular drug user, and made the case he only met his co-accused on the return journey from Dublin to Belfast.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Gavyn Cairns said that when arrested, Kazlauskas co-operated fully and "answered all questions."</p>
      <p>Describing the amount of drugs seized as "a relatively small quantity", Mr Cairns said Kazlauskas was "adamant" they were for his personal use.</p>
      <p>Mr Cairns said that when his sentence is served, Kazlauskas "will return to his Motherland."</p>
      <p>Kazlauskas admitted two charging of importing drugs and one charge of possessing drugs, with Judge Stephen Fowler granting a destruction order for the drugs seized.</p>
      <p>Sentencing Kazlauskas, the Judge said: "You came up on the bus from Dublin with wraps of heroin and Xanax tablets. It's quite clear you are a drug addict."</p>
      <p>Regarding the importation element, Judge Fowler said he accepted "the reason the drugs were being brought in was for his own personal use."</p>
