      <p>While speaking at the trailer launch, the actor revealed that he didn’t watch the original 1978 film as he didn’t want to be influenced by the character portrayal.</p>
      <p>The original film featured <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjeev-Kumar">Sanjeev Kumar</a>, Vidya Sinha and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ranjeeta-Kaur">Ranjeeta Kaur</a>.</p>
      <p>"When I was offered '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pati-Patni-Aur-Woh">Pati Patni Aur Woh</a>', I decided I wouldn't watch the original because I wanted to work a certain way in the film. If we were bringing a modern take and a certain newness, I didn't want any influence of the original in my subconscious," he said.</p>
      <p>The film is scheduled to be released on December 6.</p>
