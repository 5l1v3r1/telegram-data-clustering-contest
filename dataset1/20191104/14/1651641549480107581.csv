Microsoft Flow rebranded as Power Automate, adds support for robotic process automation
04 Nov 2019, 14:01 by Pradeep





Microsoft today announced that they are change the name of Microsoft Flow to Power Automate, to better align with other Power platform products. In addition to the new branding, Microsoft is adding support for Robotic process automation. With RPA support known as UI flows, Power Automate is becoming an end-to-end automation solution. You can do both API-based automation and UI-based automation. To create an UI flow, users have to just perform the action in their PC and Power Automate will take care of the rest.
For example, let’s say you work for an insurance claims processing company, where clients fill out digital forms, paper forms, or communicate through email. The claim is processed on modern cloud services while staff also maintain cumbersome paper records and legacy applications. With Power Automate, this entire process can be automated. Digitized data from scanned paper forms is processed with AI that recognizes forms, and old legacy systems can be automated with RPA—one platform that brings both worlds together seamlessly.
