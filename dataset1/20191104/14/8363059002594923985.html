      <h1>Huge Medical Cannabis Trial Targets 20,000 UK Patients</h1>

      <p>Doctors hope to solve the issue of the benefits of medicinal cannabis once and for all this year, when a trial involving input from 20,000 UK patients is set to get under way.</p>
      <p>The two-year trial, backed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, will look for firm evidence that the non-psychoactive blends of the plant are indeed capable of generating the serious medical benefits that many self-funding users claim, with the hope being that such a raft of positive evidence may be enough to get cannabis products approved for a much wider distribution via the NHS; without <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/10/nhs-doctors-can-prescribe-cannabis-products-from-november/">onerous layers of bureaucracy</a> to get through first, and for problems that aren't so life-threatening to their sufferers that they get on the news.</p>
      <p>RCP president Wendy Burn said: "The RCP hopes this project will address the paucity of evidence for the use of cannabis-based medicinal products in all health settings, including mental health. We hope that this project, along with other research such as more much-needed randomised control trials, will continue to build the evidence on CBMPs [Cannabis-based medicinal products]." [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/medical-cannabis-uk-clinical-trial-patients-nhs">Guardian</a>]</p>
