'The problem with them' - West Brom star gives Stoke City verdict ahead of clash
Stoke City v West Brom | The Baggies will target a move back to the Championship summit when they face the Potters tonight - but the hosts will want a response following Nathan Jones' departure
04 Nov 2019, 14:28 by Josh Murray
Darnell Furlong is expecting West Bromwich Albion to come up against a ""fighting"" Stoke City side when they meet in the Championship tonight.
The Baggies head to the bet365 Stadium knowing a victory will return them to the top of the table, while the Potters begin life without Nathan Jones, following his sacking as manager last week.
Stoke are bottom of the division after 14 matches, having won only twice this season.
But West Brom full-back Furlong - who has made 12 appearances so far in 2019-20 - believes the Potters' current situation could make them dangerous opposition.


Nathan Jones

""That's the problem with them - we know they are going to be fighting at the moment, they're going to be really strong with their attitude and we know what type of football to expect,"" he told the club's website.
""They’ve got a lot of big names, a lot of signings in the summer who are trying to prove themselves, so it’s going to be a very tough game.
""There are no easy games in the Championship but that is going to be an extremely tough one.
""I was at QPR with Jordan Cousins last season and when he went there I thought, that’s a great move for him, they’re going to be challenging at the top end of the table.
