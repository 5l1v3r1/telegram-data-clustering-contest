蟲洞存在嗎？新研究提出檢測辦法

04 Nov 2019, 14:03

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】現在大部分科學家認為，黑洞附近存在一種名為「蟲洞」（wormhole）的結構，從那裡可以通向另一個時空或是另一個宇宙。這還未得到證實。最近科學家新提出了一種可以檢驗蟲洞是否存在的方法。
科學家稱，雖然沒有特別的理由認為我們銀河系中心黑洞人馬座A（Sgr A*）的周圍一定有個蟲洞，但是從這個黑洞周圍強大的引力場來看，科學家希望能找到一個蟲洞。
然而怎麼找呢？本月發表在《物理評論》（Physical Review）D刊上的一份研究提出，如果蟲洞的「另一邊」真是另一個時空，那麼我們這個宇宙中恆星的運行軌道將在蟲洞「另一邊」恆星強大引力的影響下，出現某種偏移。也就是說，通過尋找附近恆星軌道的偏差，至少是間接探測蟲洞存在的辦法。
這份研究的主要作者、美國布法羅大學（University at Buffalo）物理系的宇宙學家斯托伊科維奇（Dejan Stojkovic）說：「如果蟲洞的兩端各有一顆恆星，在我們這一端的恆星應該會受到另一端那顆恆星引力的影響。引力波將會通過蟲洞。因此，繪製出黑洞Sgr A*附近恆星的預期軌道，如果那裡真有一個蟲洞，這些軌道將出現偏差。」
遺憾的是，科學家說，即便真的找到了蟲洞，也不是像我們想像的那樣可以直接鑽進去抵達另一個世界。
「即便有一個可以穿行的蟲洞，人類和太空船也不大可能穿過去，」斯托伊科維奇說，「實際上，需要一種負能量保證蟲洞保持開啟的狀態，我們不知道如何實現。要造一個穩定的蟲洞，需要某種魔力。」

Does the wormhole exist? New research proposes detection methods

04 Nov 2019, 14:03

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Now most scientists believe that there is a structure called ""wormhole"" near the black hole, from which it can lead to another time and space or another universe. This has not been confirmed. Recently, scientists have proposed a new method to test the existence of wormholes.
Scientists say that although there is no special reason to believe that there must be a wormhole around the Milky Way Center Black Hole Sagittarius A (Sgr A*), from the strong gravitational field around the black hole, scientists hope to find a wormhole.
However, how to find it? A study published this month in the Physical Review of D. suggests that if the ""other side"" of the wormhole is really another time and space, then the orbit of the star in our universe will be on the other side of the wormhole. Under the influence of the strong gravity of the star, there is some shift. That is to say, by looking for the deviation of the orbit around the star, at least the way to detect the existence of the wormhole indirectly.
The co-author of the study, Dejan Stojkovic, a cosmologist at the University of Buffalo, said: ""If there is a star at each end of the wormhole, here is us. The star at one end should be affected by the gravitational pull of the star at the other end. The gravitational wave will pass through the wormhole. Therefore, the expected orbit of the star near the black hole Sgr A* is drawn, and if there is a wormhole there, the orbit will be biased. ""
Regrettably, scientists say that even if a wormhole is found, it is not as straight as we can imagine to reach another world.
""Even if there is a wormhole that can be worn, humans and spacecraft are unlikely to pass through,"" Stojkovic said. ""In fact, a negative energy is needed to keep the wormhole open. We don't know how. Realization. To build a stable wormhole, you need some kind of magic.""
