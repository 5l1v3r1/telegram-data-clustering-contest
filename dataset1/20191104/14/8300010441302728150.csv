He favored long and colorful brocades and huge gemstone rings, which he flashed while pointing to viewers.



His catch phrase to his audience: ""Above all, lots and lots of love.""Mercado never publicly stated his sexuality, but he was an icon in the gay community as someone who challenged the conservative television culture in Latin America.""He endows the drag queen with papal authority,"" Diana Taylor, a New York University Tisch School of Performing Arts professor, wrote in a 2003 critique.In 1998, Mercado got in trouble for endorsing alleged health and beauty products.
