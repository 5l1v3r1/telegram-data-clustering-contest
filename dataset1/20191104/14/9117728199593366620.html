      <h1>McLaren and Petrobas confirm sponsorship split</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> have confirmed their split with sponsors Petrobas having come to a mutual agreement. The news was confirmed in a statement and the split will take place with immediate effect.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The conclusion of their partnership comes two weeks before the Brazilian Grand Prix, the home race for the company. Petrobas had been supplying fuel and lubricants for McLaren since the start of 2018 but earlier this year the president of Brazil called for an early end to the partnership.</p>
      <p>The conclusion of the deal will occur with immediate effect and will see all sponsorship removed from McLaren's livery. Zak Brown thanked Petrobas for their work and hoped to see them back in the pinnacle of motorsport in the future.</p>
