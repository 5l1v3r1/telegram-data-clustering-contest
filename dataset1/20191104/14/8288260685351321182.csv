The report claims ‘a proposal of €15million (£13m) will be sent’, but Atalanta are said to want closer to €25million (£21.6m) for the midfielder.
Kulusevski’s agent, Stefano Sem, recently discussed the interest in the Sweden under-21 international.
“For elegance I don’t name names, I only say that they were both Italian and foreign teams,"" he said.
“He’s a Swedish international, he’s a player who has a more international market than other guys even for a basic mentality and culture discourse.
 
""It’s clear that he’s a player that even at the national team, when he plays, it’s easier to follow than his other teammates who play for the Italian national team.
“The Italians have the ambition to play for Azzurri and maybe get in a big Italian club, a foreigner wants the top: if the top is in Italy good, if it’s abroad he goes abroad.”
