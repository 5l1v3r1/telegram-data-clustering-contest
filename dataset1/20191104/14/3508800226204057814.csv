《迅猛的力量》：冷戰情勢上升，CIA在這個國民黨控制的島上建立了「西方公司」

我們想讓你知道的是散布在現代中國各地，到處都有路標指向充滿英雄、惡棍和受害者的革命歷史。在西柏坡毛澤東舊基地的紀念館裡，隨著遊客腳步走動，可以看到牆上張貼了習近平的一句話：「任務尚未完成。」這是很好的提醒，一九四九年的內戰尚未結束。



文：凱文．裴萊諾（Kevin Peraino）
尾聲：天譴
六個月後，一九五○年六月的最後一週，杜魯門回到獨立城老家，預備和家人輕鬆地休息幾天。星期六晚間，用過晚飯後，全家人移動到圍了紗窗的後陽台，杜魯門的女兒瑪格麗特日後回憶，「大家閒聊，也沒談什麼特別的事。」天氣轉涼，大家又移動到屋內的書房。幾分鐘後，電話響起，杜魯門去接電話。瑪格麗特記得，當他回來時，「表情肅穆」。杜魯門告訴大家：「是狄恩．艾奇遜。共產黨入侵南韓了。」
杜魯門上床睡覺前，還提醒賓客不要過度反應。他說：「明天，我要大家假裝一切如常。」翌日上午的新聞更糟糕。杜魯門從教堂回來，全家人正要坐下來午餐時，艾奇遜再次來電話。瑪格麗特回憶：「我還記得老爸去接電話時，我媽臉上的痛苦表情。這次，狄恩．艾奇遜說，無疑是全面入侵。」艾奇遜向杜魯門報告，北韓下令七個裝甲兵師越過邊境。杜魯門掛了電話，默默吃完午餐，趕回華府，和內閣會商對策。
韓戰是一場內戰，就像中國的國共內戰，是兩個具備極不相同治理哲學的本地派系之間的戰爭。但它也是毛澤東在一九四九年大勝——以及因它產生的超級力量的捭闔縱橫——的直接遺緒。日本在第二次世界大戰戰敗後，美國和蘇聯以北緯三十八度線為界，將朝鮮半島分割為北韓和南韓。美軍在一九四五年夏天抵達，填補日本戰敗退出所留下的真空。雖然後來美國把南韓的控制權移交給聯合國，華府仍然深刻介入其中。美國的思維是，南韓復興可以增進日本的安全及經濟，針對亞洲大陸提供防衛縱深，同時又替日本商品創造一個市場，也提供原物料給予日本工業。然而，到了一九四九年，金日成領導的北韓共產政權和美國支持的南韓極端民族主義政府之間的衝突，已危及到此一不安的均勢。
毛澤東在一九四九年的勝利終於使天平偏向全面戰爭。數萬名朝鮮族戰士曾經與毛澤東部隊並肩打過中國內戰；然而在一九四九年前，他們陸續回到北韓，使金日成增加許多有豐富實戰經驗的戰士。甚至更重要的是，中國共產黨的勝利改變了鄰近朝鮮半島的基本力量之動態關係。一九四九年之前，金日成的北韓政權被夾在南邊的美國占領軍與蔣介石在邊境另一頭不友善的中央政府兩者之間。美軍在二戰後逐漸縮編，最後美軍司令官終於下令要撤出剩餘的美軍部隊。毛澤東的勝利同時也消除蔣介石對金日成北翼的威脅，使得這位北韓領導人壓力大減，大膽發動全面進犯——企圖將整個半島統一在他治理之下。
一九四九年各個事件也影響史達林對於金日成揮師南下的態度。這位北韓領導人遊說史達林支持他的南侵行動已一年多。但由於忌諱歐洲尚未安定，又不願在亞洲引爆和美國的交戰，這位蘇聯領導人一直拒絕。然而，在一九五○年，美國干預的可能性似乎不大；畢竟美國在一九四九年除了象徵性的動作外，並沒有阻擋毛澤東的勝利。一九五○年一月底，史達林終於表示願意討論這個議題。金日成稍後在春天訪問莫斯科，再度提出這個議題，這次史達林終於默許。不過，他提醒金日成，需要向北京——而非莫斯科——求助。史達林告訴金日成：「你若是被踢落牙齒，我是不會動根手指幫你的。你必須向毛澤東全面求助。」即使如此，史達林還是送俄國武器給金日成，並派遣顧問，以便在戰爭前夕強化北韓的兵力。
毛澤東對於北韓南侵的前景也相當矛盾。他的首要任務是完成自己的革命，鞏固他對大陸的控制。不過，中國歷代成功的領導人——從古代皇帝以降——也都了解，如忽略中國邊疆領土會削弱自身在中央的政權這個挑戰是在於確認哪個緊鄰地區最重要，然後衡量利弊得失。譬如，如果北韓侵略刺激到華府採取軍事反應，就會殃及到毛澤東征服台灣的企圖。然而，金日成最後還是自行決定發動攻擊，訂出突擊的時間。毛澤東也決定支持他的左翼同志。
杜魯門的回應和史達林、毛澤東的反應一樣，都是受到一九四九年諸多災難事件的影響。毛澤東的勝利促使這位美國總統將圍堵戰略擴大到全球，從歐洲延伸到亞洲。杜魯門在國務院的顧問已促請總統，在中國周邊沿線的戰略要點抵擋住共產黨推進。然而，困難之處就是細節——要決定在哪裡守衛的立場。杜魯門及其助理已決定東南亞是其中之一；到了一九五○年五月，政府開始運送武器給法國人，支助他們與越盟（Viet Minh）的作戰。現在，金日成南侵後，杜魯門決定朝鮮就是另一個戰略要點，誓言要擊敗北韓的進軍。
接下來的戰爭對於涉及的各方都是悲劇——不只是韓國人身受其害。共有兩百五十萬人於戰爭中喪生。但對如今退守在台灣的蔣介石夫婦而言，卻因韓戰而暫時得救。韓戰爆發前幾個月，毛澤東在華南集結部隊，準備攻打國府最後的基地。同時，台灣內部有一股敵對勢力醞釀要政變，推翻蔣介石——即使美國官員沒有全力支持，但至少知其內情。然而，北韓的入侵改變了一切。杜魯門迅速命令美國海軍第七艦隊駛入台灣海峽，在台灣和中國大陸之間布下障礙。表面上，這個動作是展現實力，意在守住台灣以北防線。但是，它也可以做為防止蔣介石利用亂局，從這個海島基地發動反攻。蔣介石向杜魯門提議可派三萬三千名國軍部隊參加韓戰，杜魯門立刻拒絕——再次確認他在一九四九年年底那幾天所做的艱難決定。
可是，杜魯門內閣的鷹派人士不肯放手。尤其是強生一再促請總統徵求蔣介石幫忙。強生希望在台灣海峽布雷，並從這座由國府控制的海島對大陸發動轟炸空襲。麥克阿瑟將軍發表一篇聲明，似乎在指控總統和國務院放棄台灣——其中含糊地提到「主張在太平洋姑息和失敗主義的人士」——杜魯門命令麥克阿瑟收回這段評語。總統氣憤至極，艾奇遜日後回憶，他可以看到杜魯門「雙唇緊閉，毫無血色」。強生不以為然，向艾奇遜高聲抗議，質疑杜魯門是否「膽敢」在戰爭進行期間，和他民間聲望極高的前司令官槓上。
但是杜魯門堅守他的立場。他日後回憶，他對國防部長愈來愈難以忍受，因為強生「開始表現出過度自大的態度，想要主導整個政府」。基於這個以及其他原因，杜魯門在九月間某日召見強生，要求這位國防部長提出辭呈。強生有如五雷轟頂，在夜裡躑躅獨行五英里，從華府康乃迪克大道走到查維卻斯鎮（Chavy Chase）。次日，強生又和杜魯門見面，落淚哭求總統不要革他的職。強生說：「你這樣會毀了我。」但是杜魯門心意已決。杜魯門告訴一位助理：「開革強生是我最艱難的決定。我（覺得）就像鞭打我女兒瑪格麗特一樣。」

不過，整體而言，夏天最後幾週的發展讓杜魯門精神大振。美國率領的聯合國部隊開始逆轉共產黨在朝鮮半島的戰果。九月中旬，在仁川大膽的兩棲登陸後，盟軍一路打進北韓，占領平壤，甚至即將制伏敵軍的勢力。毛澤東的使節慌張地與史達林會商，史達林要求中國介入。雖然毛澤東沒有任何正式責任與義務要參戰，他最後還是聽從史達林的建議。他決定派出數十萬大軍跨過鴨綠江，協助北韓。聽到消息後，年邁的史達林感動得含淚歡呼：「中國同志一級棒！」
中國參戰促使美國鷹派更加極力主張恢復與蔣介石的舊交情。麥克阿瑟將軍希望徵求台灣國軍的協助，開闢第二戰場，從毛澤東的南翼進行騷擾。依照麥克阿瑟的戰略，蔣介石要恢復他在一九四九年執行的相同政策，包括針對大陸封鎖海岸和空襲轟炸。然而，杜魯門和艾奇遜仍然不願意擴大戰事，堅守他們在過去一年所發展出來的較為謹慎的立場。最後，到了一九五一年四月，杜魯門受不了麥克阿瑟一再抗命，決定開除這位不聽話的大將。杜魯門透過電視演講，重申過去兩年他東亞政策的邏輯。杜魯門問道：「有什麼事情比起我們的軍事力量投注在和中國全面戰爭，更吻合克里姆林宮的野心？」
同一時期，毛澤東也野心勃勃地在中國另一周邊地區確立其勢力。毛澤東長期以來擔心——也不是全無道理——美國特務在西藏陰謀鼓動反對的勢力。隨著一九五○年時序展開，艾奇遜在私下表示，希望見到西藏「悄悄強化」，美國在西藏首府拉薩的特務也爭取予以軍事援助。中國共產黨的軍事指揮官還拿出曾經替老美工作的白俄間諜所蒐集的情報，揭穿美方的陰謀。最後，毛澤東受不了，在一九五○年十月下令九萬名軍隊開進西藏，迅速擊敗地方上的反抗戰士。
毛澤東認為東南亞的動盪是他鞏固邊界的另一個機會。特別在中南半島，法國部隊持續激戰，要剿平胡志明領導的民族主義革命。胡志明是曾經在蘇聯研習的共產黨員，能說流利中國話，似乎就是天生的盟友。毛澤東宣布中華人民共和國建政時，胡志明從越南北部步行十七天到中國，與華南的中共官員會商；後來又前往莫斯科，會見史達林。到了一九四九年底，毛澤東已定期送武器越過邊境，從廣西到中南半島北部，來協助胡志明的游擊隊。同一時間，杜魯門及其團隊也對共產黨在中南半島發動革命的前景產生戒心，因此開始增運軍事物資到中南半島。到了一九五○年秋天，杜魯門政府已送了數十架地獄貓（Hellcat）和熊貓（Bearcat）戰鬥機到越南，又派遣美軍顧問及其他轟炸機、推土機及重機械。杜魯門及其高級助理現在把中南半島戰事視為最高優先事項之一；唯有朝鮮半島的部隊能獲得更多的美國軍事援助。
最後，隨著韓戰戰情膠著，甚至一度備受輕蔑的蔣介石在台部隊也開始在美國的戰爭計畫扮演更重要的角色。到了一九五一年，由於冷戰的軍事化程度上升，中央情報局在這個國民黨所控制的島上建立了一個繁忙的工作站，在台北近郊一個代號為武昌新村的營地活動。中央情報局成立了一家空殼公司——「西方公司」（Western Enterprises），用來掩護美國在台軍官的活動。實際上，美軍在台灣培訓游擊戰士，教他們利用傳單、無線電和熱汽球向大陸散播宣傳。一九五四年，因為愈來愈關注共產主義在東亞的影響力升高，美國簽署了《東南亞集體防禦公約》（Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty）——這是一九四九年蔣介石倡導的《太平洋公約》的溫和版。同年，美國又與蔣介石簽署《中美共同防禦條約》（Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty)，防衛台灣免受侵略。
這些措施成功地確保蔣介石此一海島基地的生存。但是，中央情報局企圖破壞毛澤東在大陸統治的努力則證明不是那麼順利。到了一九五○年代末期，中央情報局已空降數百名特務進入大陸，企圖蒐集情報和製造事端。然而，誠如艾奇遜所預測的，這些任務都無法發揮作用。中央情報局一位站長日後回憶：「我們透過無線電聯繫，然後就音訊全無了。」

華德．李普曼在毛澤東勝利後幾個月，頗有先見之明地寫道，一九四九年的事件「需要以較長期的觀察去理解，而非僅靠明天的頭條新聞就能知其內情」。李普曼認為艾奇遜的政策基本上是合理的，他特別欽佩國務卿「拒絕以挑激美國與赤色中國的衝突，來遮掩（與俄羅斯的）衝突」。不過，他指出，艾奇遜的忍耐策略要好幾年才會見效——最後，也果真如此。他寫道：「我們不能繃緊神經等待毛澤東違抗史達林的新聞。上天有眼，不是不報，只是時候未到，在亞洲的報應特別慢。」
艾奇遜雖有耐心，但他不是姑息主義者。他不喜歡強生，不是因為強生好勇鬥狠，而是因為國防部長觸動杜魯門最宏偉的幻想——包括美國可以在某種程度上拯救中國的這個信念。艾奇遜是個註冊的民主黨員，具有進步的思想，但是他不能容忍某位現代作家所謂的「廉價、輕快的普世主義」（cheap and cheerful universalism）。艾奇遜認為，杜魯門最喜歡的詩〈洛克斯萊廳〉預言和平即將到來，其實包含「重大的謬誤」。艾奇遜後來解釋，丁尼生的樂觀主義忽視了人類生存的悲慘、嫉妒和敵意面，這些故意的衝突模式在地球上已存在數千年之久。
艾奇遜說服杜魯門在一九四九年採納的策略，依賴於黑暗但是連貫的世界觀。艾奇遜雖然是一位聖公會主教的兒子，卻不是傳統的虔誠信教者，不過他仍然吸收了聖經的宇宙論——尤其是理解人類意志的矛盾方面。一方面，人類是自由、強有力的；另一方面，不受約束的自由卻必然導致戰爭和毀滅。艾奇遜後來解釋，他認為「武力和暴力」雖冷酷，但在人世間卻是不可避免的現實。艾奇遜指出，美國的敵人——譬如史達林和毛澤東這類的人——都精明地基於「實力估算」的策略。美國如果打算在這個危險的世界生存下去，就需要做同樣的事情——但是需要謹慎小心。
或許艾奇遜的世界觀不是那麼開朗、樂觀，但也不是不抱希望。對艾奇遜而言，在無情的世界中禁得起風雨拂逆的第一步，就是試著看清楚現實。從悲劇的角度來看，認識到美國的敵人也只是人，受到同樣的弱點和判斷失誤的影響，甚至還有一種安慰作用。最重要的是，悲劇性的世界觀以其對人類理性界線的懷疑，為最終的救贖打開了前景。如同肯楠曾在日記中寫下，「認識到人類智慧的局限性，並允許真正的悲劇情境存在」的世界觀，也承認「人類不易察覺的解決方法……」的可能性。

對毛澤東而言，他不搞這些形而上學的臆測。他認為行使人類的意志時，沒有所謂矛盾這回事，只看機會是否存在。毛澤東學生時代時曾在一本課本邊緣潦草地寫下他的感想：「有人說，我們必須相信道德律法來自上帝的命令，因為只有這樣，它才能被執行而不被藐視。但其實這是一種奴性的心態。你為什麼要服從上帝而不是服從自己呢？」一九四九年勝利後的幾年裡，毛澤東似乎運用這種意識作為他的模板——容忍不斷擴大的個人崇拜，並大膽試圖推翻中國古代正統的觀念。
毛澤東在戰後的政策包括野心勃勃、唐吉訶德式的社會和經濟改造作為。一九五○年代末期展開的大躍進運動，毛澤東試圖藉由激烈改造其經濟，強力迫使中國踏進現代時代。他渴望提升中國的工業和農業產出，為鋼鐵和穀物產量訂下不切實際的目標——然後要求透過一系列激烈改革達成這些目標。中國的農村被改組為人民公社，毛澤東希望透過經濟規模和分工制度，增進效率。同時，個人及公社在後院土法煉鋼，希望提升產量。農村到處可以聽到勞工高唱「超英趕美」的愛國歌曲。
然而，毛澤東並沒有經濟經驗，大躍進帶來了巨大災難。後院煉鋼爐生產的鋼鐵毫無用處，反而占用可以用在其他地方的勞動力。農耕方式的創新——有些是由毛澤東本人設想出來的——所產生的各種荒謬的作法：富有想像力但不切實際的新奇事物，層出不窮，包括拿朝鮮薊和向日葵、南瓜和木瓜交叉繁殖。不幸的是，一連串惡劣的氣候——包括中國某些地區鬧颱風和洪水，其他地區卻發生無情的乾旱——加劇了痛苦。農民們到處找樹葉、樹皮和蠕蟲吃，勉強求活命。由於改革失敗和隨後發生的飢荒，約有兩、三千萬農民活活餓死。
然而，毛澤東的政權竟然挺過此一瘋狂決策造成的災禍，存活下來，到了一九六○年代，他又投入心力要改造中國社會。他和盟友在一九六○年代末期發動所謂的「無產階級文化大革命」運動，企圖消滅資產階級影響力的最後痕跡，純化全國。毛澤東的信徒把它當做是合乎一九四九年革命邏輯的延伸，持續當年礙於現實考量而未完成的蛻變。現在毛澤東的忠實信徒指示，「只要是一切不符合社會主義制度及無產階級專政的事物都應該予以批鬥」。他們把激進青年組織為紅衛兵，派他們四處塗毀舊文化的標誌，攻擊他們所認為食古不化的中國知識份子或甚至任何政敵。
在這場大屠殺中，對毛澤東的個人崇拜卻達到巔峰。朝聖者揮舞著《毛語錄》，跋涉數日參觀這位「偉大的舵手」昔日的「革命聖地」。民族主義的激情經常表現為尖銳的狂熱。狂熱的追隨者高呼反美口號，揮舞假想的刺刀。然而，最終這個原本就雜亂無章的運動開始分裂，引發了一系列內部的破壞性暴力，嚴重傷害中國經濟，也破壞毛澤東在海外的聲望。
即使如此，毛澤東繼續自視為世界舞台上的要角，提供武器和人員協助世界各地的革命黨，譬如越南的胡志明游擊隊。一九六○年代末期，被稱為一九四九年「私生子遺緒」（bastardlegacy）的越戰，打得如火如荼。傷亡日益慘重、分裂益發加劇的戰事，逼得已退休多年的杜魯門和艾奇遜重新評估他們在亞洲圍堵政策的後果。林登．詹森（Lyndon Johnson) 總統明白，杜魯門政府當年第一步走向的這場戰爭現在已危及到他的施政，因此經常試圖爭取這位前任總統支持他升高越戰的決定——甚至幾度親赴獨立城拜訪年邁的杜魯門，向他請益。至少在公開場合中，杜魯門是保持沉默的。
但是，艾奇遜則不吝提供意見。一九六七年艾奇遜在白宮某次會議中向詹森表示：「我們當然不應退出越南。」他又說，唯有展現美國的決心，才能說服胡志明放棄他對南越的企圖。然而，到了翌年，由於越共發動的春節大攻勢（Tet Offensive），加上美國及英國陷入經濟危機，艾奇遜開始對越戰失去信心。他現在勸詹森退出越南，專注於「力所能及」的地區——主要在歐洲。
不過，一九四九年杜魯門和艾奇遜共同制訂的戰略，也指向二十年後尼克森總統所採行的對北京比較親善的政策。到了一九七○年代，尼克森想退出越南，推動翻轉數十年來美國孤立毛澤東的政策。多年來，莫斯科和北京之間的關係逐漸磨損，部分是因為美國設法煽動這兩個共產主義大國彼此針鋒相對。雖然尼克森的戰略和艾奇遜的戰略不盡相同，兩個人卻確實共同有著宏觀的意識：試圖鼓動中蘇交惡將有利於美國。一九七二年二月，尼克森成為第一位訪問中國，並與毛澤東會面的美國總統。此時的毛澤東日薄崦嵫，變成「孤立、癡肥、喃喃自語、不時流口水的獨裁者」。將近七年後，華府終於承認中華人民共和國——結束長達三十年的外交邊緣政策。

艾奇遜在晚年時並沒有因為北京和莫斯科逐漸失和而感到欣慰。中國問題玷汙了他一度閃耀的聲譽；右翼的反共人士和左翼的反戰抗議者都為他感到可惜。最後，一九四九年的遺緒——儘管艾奇遜在某些方面做了最大的努力——包括長達三十年不承認共產中國，長達數十年支持台灣，以及韓戰和越戰。艾奇遜指責「狂熱追求神靈的人」，只要涉及到中國的辯論，就立刻「熱血湧上耳朵」。但他的世界觀卻一直保有神學色彩。有一次在阿拉巴馬州一個空軍基地演說時，艾奇遜引用了切斯特頓（G. K. Chesterton）的一首詩；切斯特頓是對人類心理頗有研究的作家。艾奇遜朗讀：「我告訴你，不是為了安慰你／是的，不是因為你盼望／除了天空變得愈來愈黑暗／而海面升高。」一年多後，艾奇遜在馬里蘭州的鄉村別墅因中風去世，享年七十八歲。
杜魯門也感受到中國崩潰的打擊和背叛。在某種意義上，他從未放棄過挽救遠方麻煩焦點的願望。他在卸任告別演說中說：「我對自由人的命運抱持深刻而持久的信念。有了耐心和勇氣，我們終有一天進入一個新時代——一個美好的黃金時代——我們可以利用科學為我們打造的和平工具，來泯除地球各處的貧困和人類的苦難。」不過，杜魯門認識到自己遠遠沒有達到這個理想，尤其是中國問題方面。杜魯門卸任後，有一次，在拍攝一部關於他的東亞政策的紀錄片時，影片製作人注意到，這位前總統一再溜進隔壁房間，裡頭有一瓶已經打開的波本威士忌。隨著說話愈來愈語無倫次，杜魯門開始胡言亂語，大罵「清客」和「黃膚老中」。製作人受不了，厭惡地逃離房間。艾奇遜去世一年以後——也就是尼克森訪問北京數月後——杜魯門也因病去世。
到了一九七○年代，毛澤東的聲譽就和杜魯門和艾奇遜一樣，都因為自己的政策而蒙塵。就像對待一九四九年的其他勝利者一樣，時間和命運都很無情。雖然中國國內崇拜毛澤東的狂熱達到巔峰，但除了中國以外，外國政治家都在嘲笑他的低能。到了晚年，即使一向狂妄、大談人類意志力的毛澤東似乎也開始懂得反省，緩和下來。他在紫禁城寓所接受一位美國的記者專訪，喝著茅台時，他提到人類非常需要崇拜某種東西或某個人。這位中國領導人似乎愈來愈介意自己的死亡。他向這位記者提到，即使是他也要「很快去見上帝」。隨著一九七六年到來，他多次心臟病發；九月間，毛澤東死了。
周以德比毛澤東長壽近二十年，得以親見中華人民共和國經濟崛起的第一道閃光。他覺得被尼克森總統向中國開放的政策所出賣，致函尼克森抗議此「尖銳的大翻轉」。即使到了一九八○年代，周以德依然極力抗議北京政府所構成的威脅。他不能理解，已有數十年的事實證據，為什麼美國人還不能看清中共政權的真正本質。一九八二年，周以德出現在威廉．巴克萊（William F. Buckley）主持的電視節目《火線》（Firing Line）後，收到一位觀眾的來信：八十五歲的宋美齡讚許他持續不斷揭露中共政權的「獸性」，也責備「心懷報復、包藏顛覆禍心的左派群體」過去錯誤的策略。一如過去五十年，周以德繼續到處旅行、演講多年。最後，他在一九九四年與世長辭，享年九十五歲。
宋美齡回到台灣後，與丈夫定居在台北北郊山上的一棟花崗岩別墅。這個舒適的寓所遍植五彩繽紛的杜鵑花和蘭花，她作畫、祈禱，並思索計策。台灣在她丈夫的統治下出現殘暴的鎮壓，壓制政治異議份子。但一九七五年蔣中正去世後，島內的政治氣氛逐漸變得不那麼高壓。經濟上也蓬勃發展，成為東亞最具活力的地區之一，號稱「亞洲四小龍」之一。隨著昔日的敵意消退，宋美齡回到美國，最後在曼哈坦上城東區買下一戶公寓。她在這裡反省，憶起「當年的緊張時期，深深焦慮的日子，遭逢和克服拂逆的時刻」，這些場景「像萬花筒般，一一在我的腦海中閃過」。當二十世紀終於轉到二十一世紀時，她早已歡慶百歲嵩壽。在一九四九年眾多戰士中，她最長壽。

天命繼續演進。宋美齡在二○○三年去世，高齡一百零六歲。她去世後十多年，東亞仍繼續演進。現在，我們可以在不到十四個小時內從紐約飛到北京，但是我們再也看不到一九四九年的中國。昔日的中國長期被兩位數字經濟成長率、政府改造和意識形態淨化等消除殆盡，早已遠颺。儘管現代中國政治人物對毛澤東推崇備至，但是中國的蓬勃發展並非是因為毛澤東的影響力。毛澤東的繼任者繼續進行市場改革，對於中國二十一世紀的經濟崛起，發揮更重要的作用。不過，某些學者仍然提醒說，徹底否定毛澤東革命的淨化作用也是錯誤的。他們拿它與「森林大火」做比較，其雖然具有破壞性，也為「新的成長」奠定基礎。
不論原因為何，今天中國再次讓人無法漠視。當它的股市下挫時，全世界都會密切注意。當它的海軍在南海某個島礁加強工事時，超級大國就坐立不安。北京的政策和軍事領導人擔心現代版的美國圍堵政策，但是，實際上，那場戰鬥早已結束。不論是利是弊，中國早已整合進入全球經濟。中國有位著名的將領最近宣稱，他的國家「再也不會被圍堵」。基本上，他說得沒錯。
話雖如此，一九四九年的迴聲卻無處不在。美國人仍在辯論如何針對充滿活力的中國做出最好的回應——無論與其領導人接觸，或與之對抗；如果是的話，又應該在哪裡畫下紅線。一九四九年最波動的地區，仍然是今天最不穩定的地區之一。特別是台灣的未來，似乎不如過去幾年那麼令人放心。島內的政治——部分是因一九四九年毛澤東在大陸勝利而播遷來台的移民所塑造——仍然非常棘手。蔣介石的國民黨曾以鐵腕治理台灣，現在它再也無法獨斷獨行。在二○一六年的總統大選中，台灣人推選的蔡英文是出自蔣介石國民黨以外（民進黨）的第二位總統。國內政治是台北最不用擔心的問題。雖然川普總統處理東亞事務種種不可預測的方式鼓勵了一些台灣人，但其他人更擔心，輕率的挑釁只會進一步破壞東亞地區的穩定。
與此同時，只要在政治上有用處，北京領導人從不吝於試圖重新創造一九四九年的魔力。在經濟不穩定時，這種民族主義的手法特別有吸引力，此時軍事強悍可以分散老百姓的注意力。然而，即使在旺盛時期，歷史回憶也有著誘人的力量。散布在現代中國各地，到處都有路標指向充滿英雄、惡棍和受害者的革命歷史。在西柏坡毛澤東舊基地的紀念館裡，隨著遊客腳步走動，可以看到牆上張貼了習近平的一句話：「任務尚未完成。」這是很好的提醒，一九四九年的內戰尚未結束。

本書榮獲2018年杜魯門圖書獎及《紐約時報書評》編輯選書

2019年正值中共建政七十週年，美中貿易戰事正酣，焦慮的中國官員和官媒一片同仇敵愾，認為今天美國的政策是1949年出現過的圍堵戰略之續集。他們擔心美國部隊在東亞地區的部署和訓練任務，也密切注意西藏、新疆和台灣等熱點地區，懷疑美國一如以往想從中作梗。
若要理解當今的美中台關係，就必須了解七十年前這段歷史。《迅猛的力量》帶我們重回這個歷史轉捩點的現場。
1949年頭幾個月，美國總統杜魯門面臨了迫在眉睫的外交浩劫。整個春天和夏天，毛澤東的共產黨部隊擴散到中國大陸各地，殲滅美國盟友蔣介石的部隊，並控制了北京、上海和其他主要城市。杜魯門和他的助手，包括精明而無情的國務卿狄恩．艾奇遜，忙著應付快速變化的局勢，不僅要與毛澤東鬥爭，還要對付國內政敵的猛烈攻擊。杜魯門和艾奇遜甚至透過公布白皮書的消極作為，無情地指控蔣介石，並承認毛澤東的革命已超出美國的影響力。在此過程中，美國的角色，上自政府組織下至許許多多個別人士，其政策規劃與制定、諸多大膽的假設與曾經被束之高閣的建言、對國共內戰「錯誤」的局勢推論，許多作為與消極的不作為，對後來的美中台關係有著深遠的影響。
在這動盪的一年，毛澤東在北京建立了新的革命政府，為打造現代中國奠定基礎，而蔣介石則退守台灣基地。這些事件改變了美國的外交政策，最終導致了華府與共產中國數十年的摩擦、美國對台灣的長期承諾，以及隨後在朝鮮和越南的戰爭。
美國的決策者為了因應毛澤東的勝勢所做出的回應，彼此也產生了激烈的爭論。有人想和毛澤東打交道，有人想要對抗他，也有一些人完全不想理會他。在這些不同的主張中，還存在著千絲萬縷的細微差異。這些爭端不僅僅是戰術上的意見分歧，也反映出美國與中國關係的本質存在深刻的分歧，及美國自身的矛盾。1949年年底，美國將原本主要限於歐洲的圍堵共產主義政策延伸到亞洲。杜魯門政府制定了一項雄心勃勃的計畫——包括一連串祕密作業——來支持中國周邊國家。即使毛澤東鞏固了對大陸的控制，美國也悄悄提供金錢和武器給他的敵人。
本書作者凱文．裴萊諾引用中國和俄羅斯的文件資料，及最近中央情報局解密的檔案，精巧佈局、娓娓道來，也揭露許多過去鮮為人知的歷史。他透過主要參與者的眼睛來敘述這個非凡之年的故事，包括毛澤東、杜魯門總統、國務卿艾奇遜、明尼蘇達州國會眾議員周以德，以及蔣介石的夫人宋美齡，巧妙地將幾條不同主線交織在一起，並加上國際政治的視角，讓我們看見一個更為豐富的歷史圖像。
凱文．裴萊諾細膩地重建那一整年的來龍去脈，變化流轉，描繪歷史如何隨著各方行動者的合縱連橫、計算與失算，隨著時序一步一步地展開。在其中，我們看到美國總統杜魯門與擘劃外交事務的國務卿艾奇遜，在理念上不時齟齬，也看到親蔣與棄蔣的勢力如何互相傾軋，以及中華民國極具影響力的第一夫人宋美齡如何運籌帷幄。隨著時局的變換，各方陣營也隨之做出調整，與時俱進。
在今天，1949年的時代意義，對中國、美國和世界其他地區之間的關係，比以往任何時候都來得重要。因為北京對南海提出主權聲索，而台灣與大陸之間的緊張關係仍然存在。在這本探討1949年蔣介石政府垮台、毛澤東共產主義勢力獲勝的作品中，這場非同尋常的政治革命至今仍影響著東亞政治。

What we want you to know is spread throughout modern China, with signs everywhere pointing to revolutionary history filled with heroes, villains and victims. In the memorial hall of the old base of Mao Zedong in Xibaipo, as the tourists walked, you can see a sentence posted by Xi Jinping on the wall: ""The mission has not been completed."" This is a good reminder that the civil war in 1949 is not over yet. .



Text: Kevin. Kevin Peraino
End: Heaven
Six months later, in the last week of June 1950, Truman returned to his home in the independent city, preparing to rest easily with his family for a few days. On Saturday night, after dinner, the whole family moved to the back balcony around the screen window. Dulumen’s daughter Margaret recalled in the future, “Everyone chats and doesn’t talk about anything special.” The weather turned cold and everyone moved to The study in the house. After a few minutes, the phone rings and Truman picks up the phone. Margaret remembers that when he returned, ""the expression was solemn."" Truman told everyone: ""It is Dean Acheson. The Communists invaded South Korea.""
Before Truman went to bed, he also reminded guests not to overreact. He said: ""Tomorrow, I want everyone to pretend that everything is as usual."" The news on the morning of the next day was even worse. Truman came back from the church, and when the whole family was about to sit down for lunch, Acheson called again. Margaret recalled: ""I still remember the painful expression on my mother's face when Dad was answering the phone. This time, Dean Acheson said that it was undoubtedly a full-scale invasion."" Acheson reported to Truman, North Korea ordered Seven armored divisions crossed the border. Truman hung up the phone, silently finished the lunch, rushed back to Washington, and negotiated with the cabinet.
The Korean War is a civil war, just like the Chinese Civil War. It is a war between two local factions with very different governance philosophies. But it is also the direct remnant of Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949, and the superpower of it. After the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, the United States and the Soviet Union divided the Korean Peninsula into North Korea and South Korea. The US military arrived in the summer of 1945 to fill the vacuum left by the Japanese defeat. Although the United States later transferred control of South Korea to the United Nations, Washington was still deeply involved. The American thinking is that the South Korean renaissance can enhance Japan's security and economy, provide defense depth for the Asian continent, and at the same time create a market for Japanese goods, and also provide raw materials for Japanese industry. However, by 1949, the conflict between the North Korean communist regime led by Kim Il Sung and the South Korean ultra-nationalist government supported by the United States had jeopardized this uneasy balance of power.
Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949 finally turned the balance to a full-scale war. Tens of thousands of Korean warriors once fought side by side with the Mao Zedong troops in the Chinese Civil War; however, they returned to North Korea one by one by 1949, which enabled Kim Il Sung to add many warriors with rich practical experience. Even more importantly, the victory of the Chinese Communist Party has changed the dynamic relationship of the basic forces adjacent to the Korean peninsula. Before 1949, Kim Il Sung’s North Korean regime was sandwiched between the US occupying forces in the south and Chiang Kai-shek’s unfriendly central government on the other side of the border. After the Second World War, the US military gradually reduced its contraction. Finally, the US military commander finally ordered the withdrawal of the remaining US troops. Mao Zedong’s victory also eliminated Chiang Kai-shek’s threat to Kim Il Sung’s northern wing, which caused the North Korean leader’s pressure to be greatly reduced and boldly launched a full-scale intrusion—in an attempt to unify the entire peninsula under his administration.
The events of 1949 also affected Stalin’s attitude toward Kim Il Sung’s move to the south. The North Korean leader lobbied Stalin for supporting his invasion of the South for more than a year. However, because the taboo of Europe has not yet settled, and is reluctant to detonate the war with the United States in Asia, the Soviet leader has refused. However, in 1950, the possibility of US intervention did not seem to be great; after all, the United States did not block Mao Zedong’s victory in 1949 except for symbolic actions. At the end of January 1950, Stalin finally expressed his willingness to discuss this issue. Kim Il Sung later visited Moscow in the spring and raised this issue again. This time, Stalin finally acquiesced. However, he reminded Kim Il Sung that he needed help from Beijing, not Moscow. Stalin told Kim Il Sung: ""If you are kicked out of the teeth, I will not help you with your fingers. You must ask Mao Zedong for help."" Even so, Stalin sent Russian weapons to Kim Il Sung and sent consultants. In order to strengthen North Korea’s strength on the eve of the war.
Mao Zedong’s prospects for the North Korean invasion are also quite contradictory. His first task is to complete his revolution and consolidate his control of the mainland. However, the successful leaders of China's successive generations – descending from the ancient emperors – also understand that the challenge of neglecting China's border territory will weaken its own central government. The challenge is to identify which neighborhood is most important, and then measure the pros and cons. For example, if North Korea’s aggression stimulates a military response to Washington, it will hit Mao Zedong’s attempt to conquer Taiwan. However, Kim Il Sung finally decided to launch an attack and set a time for the assault. Mao Zedong also decided to support his left-wing comrades.
Truman’s response was the same as that of Stalin and Mao Zedong, and was affected by many disasters in 1949. Mao Zedong’s victory prompted the US president to expand the containment strategy to the world and from Europe to Asia. Truman’s advisers at the State Department have urged the president to steer the Communist Party’s advancement along strategic points along the borders of China. However, the difficulty is the details - to decide where to guard the position. Truman and his assistants have decided that Southeast Asia is one of them; by May 1950, the government began to deliver weapons to the French to support their operations with Viet Minh. Now, after Kim Il Sung’s invasion, Truman decided that North Korea is another strategic point and vowed to defeat North Korea’s march.
The next war is a tragedy for all involved parties - not just Koreans. A total of 2.5 million people were killed in the war. But for the Chiang Kai-shek couple who are now retiring in Taiwan, they were temporarily saved because of the Korean War. A few months before the outbreak of the Korean War, Mao Zedong assembled troops in South China and prepared to attack the last base of the government. At the same time, there is a hostile force inside Taiwan that is tempted to coup and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek - even if US officials do not fully support it, at least they know their insiders. However, North Korea’s invasion has changed everything. Truman quickly ordered the US Navy's Seventh Fleet to enter the Taiwan Strait, laying a barrier between Taiwan and China. On the surface, this action is to show strength, intended to hold the defense line north of Taiwan. However, it can also be used to prevent Chiang Kai-shek from using the chaos to launch counterattacks from this island base. Chiang Kai-shek proposed to Truman to send 33,000 national troops to participate in the Korean War. Truman immediately refused - reconfirming the difficult decision he made in the days to the end of 1949.
However, the hawks of the Truman cabinet refused to let go. In particular, Johnson & Johnson has repeatedly urged the President to seek help from Chiang Kai-shek. Johnson hopes to mine in the Taiwan Strait and launch a bombing attack on the mainland from this island controlled by the government. General MacArthur issued a statement that appeared to accuse the president and the State Department of abandoning Taiwan - which vaguely mentioned ""People who advocated palliative and defeatism in the Pacific"" - Truman ordered MacArthur to take back the comment. The president was extremely angry. Acheson recalled in the future that he could see Truman's lips closed and bloodless. Johnson and Johnson disagreed and protested to Acheson, questioning whether Truman was ""daring"" during the war and with his predecessor's prestigious commander.
But Truman kept his position. He recalled in the future that he was becoming more and more intolerable to the Minister of Defense, because Johnson & Johnson ""began to show an over-arrogant attitude and want to dominate the entire government."" For this and other reasons, Truman summoned Johnson on a certain day in September and asked the defense secretary to submit his resignation. Johnson & Johnson is like a thunderstorm. In the night, he walks five miles and walks from the Washington, DC, to the Chavy Chase. The next day, Johnson and Johnson met with Truman again, crying and crying for the president to refrain from his duties. Johnson said: ""You will ruin me this way."" But Truman's mind has been decided. Truman told an assistant: ""Opening Johnson is my toughest decision. I think it is like whipping my daughter Margaret.""

However, overall, the development of the last few weeks of the summer has greatly enhanced the spirit of Truman. The United Nations forces led by the United States began to reverse the Communist Party’s achievements on the Korean peninsula. In mid-September, after the bold amphibious landing in Incheon, the Allies entered North Korea all the way, occupied Pyongyang, and even smashed the forces of the enemy. Mao Zedong’s envoys rushed to discuss with Stalin, and Stalin asked China to intervene. Although Mao Zedong did not have any formal responsibilities and obligations to participate in the war, he finally followed Stalin's suggestion. He decided to send hundreds of thousands of troops across the Yalu River to assist North Korea. After hearing the news, the old Stalin was moved to tears and cheered: ""Chinese comrades are great!""
China’s participation in the war prompted the American hawks to even more strongly advocate the restoration of the old friendship with Chiang Kai-shek. General MacArthur hoped to seek the assistance of the Taiwan National Army and open up the second battlefield to harass from the south wing of Mao Zedong. According to MacArthur's strategy, Chiang Kai-shek wants to resume the same policies he had implemented in 1949, including blocking the coast and air strike bombing against the mainland. However, Truman and Acheson are still reluctant to expand the war and stick to the more cautious stance they have developed over the past year. Finally, in April 1951, Truman couldn’t stand MacArthur’s repeated disappointment and decided to fire the disobedient general. Truman, through a televised speech, reiterated the logic of his East Asian policy over the past two years. Truman asked: ""Is there anything more in line with our military power betting on the overall war with China, more in line with the ambitions of the Kremlin?""
During the same period, Mao Zedong also ambitiously established its power in another surrounding area of China. Mao Zedong has long been worried - not completely unreasonable - the US spy in Tibet conspiring to incite opposition. With the unfolding of the 1950s, Acheson said privately that he hopes to see Tibet ""sneak intensified"" and that the US spies in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, also seek military assistance. The military commander of the Communist Party of China also took out the intelligence collected by the white Russian spies who had worked for the United States and exposed the US conspiracy. In the end, Mao Zedong couldn't stand it. In October 1950, 90,000 troops were ordered to enter Tibet and quickly defeated the local resistance fighters.
Mao Zedong believed that the turmoil in Southeast Asia was another opportunity for him to consolidate his borders. Especially in the Indo-China Peninsula, the French forces continued to fight fiercely, and they wanted to flatten the nationalist revolution led by Ho Chi Minh. Ho Chi Minh is a member of the Communist Party who studied in the Soviet Union. He is fluent in Chinese and seems to be a natural ally. When Mao Zedong announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Ho Chi Minh walked from northern Vietnam to China for 17 days and met with Chinese officials in South China. Later he went to Moscow to meet with Stalin. By the end of 1949, Mao Zedong had regularly sent weapons across the border, from Guangxi to the northern part of the Indo-China Peninsula to assist Ho Chi Minh’s guerrillas. At the same time, Truman and his team also warned against the prospect of the Communist Party launching a revolution in the Indo-China Peninsula, so it began to increase military supplies to the Indo-China Peninsula. By the fall of 1950, the Truman administration had sent dozens of Hellcat and Bearcat fighters to Vietnam, and sent US military advisers and other bombers, bulldozers and heavy machinery. Truman and his senior assistants now regard the war in the Indo-China peninsula as one of the top priorities; only the troops on the Korean peninsula can obtain more US military assistance.
Finally, with the Korean War, even the once contemptuous Chiang Kai-shek regiment began to play a more important role in the US war plan. By 1951, due to the rising degree of militarization of the Cold War, the CIA established a busy workstation on the island controlled by the Kuomintang, and a camp in the suburbs of Taipei, codenamed Wuchang New Village. The CIA set up a shell company, Western Enterprises, to cover the activities of US military officers in Taiwan. In fact, the US military trained guerrilla fighters in Taiwan and taught them to use leaflets, radios and hot air balloons to spread propaganda to the mainland. In 1954, because of the growing concern about the increased influence of communism in East Asia, the United States signed the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, which was promoted by Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. A mild version of the Pacific Convention. In the same year, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty to defend Taiwan from aggression.
These measures have succeeded in ensuring the survival of Chiang Kai-shek's island base. However, the CIA’s efforts to undermine Mao Zedong’s rule on the mainland proved to be not so smooth. By the end of the 1950s, the CIA had aired hundreds of agents to enter the mainland in an attempt to gather intelligence and create trouble. However, as Acheson predicted, these tasks are not working. A webmaster of the CIA recalled in the future: ""We contacted by radio, and then there was no news.""

Huade. A few months after the victory of Mao Zedong, Lippmann wrote presciently that the 1949 event ""needs to be understood by longer-term observations, rather than just by headline news tomorrow."" Lippmann believes that Acheson’s policy is basically reasonable. He particularly admires the Secretary of State’s “refusal to challenge the conflict between the United States and the Red China to cover up the conflict with Russia”. However, he pointed out that Acheson’s endurance strategy will take several years to come to fruition – and finally, it is true. He wrote: ""We can't keep nervous and wait for Mao Zedong to disobey Stalin's news. God has eyes, not not reporting, but time has not arrived, and the retribution in Asia is particularly slow.""
Although Acheson has patience, he is not a palatarian. He doesn't like Johnson, not because of Johnson and Johnson, but because the Secretary of Defense touches Truman's most grand illusions, including the belief that the United States can save China to some extent. Acheson is a registered Democrat with progressive ideas, but he cannot tolerate what a modern writer calls ""cheap and cheerful universalism."" Acheson believes that Truman’s favorite poem, the Locksley Hall, predicts that peace is about to come, and it actually contains ""significant fallacies."" Acheson later explained that Tennyson’s optimism ignored the tragic, embarrassing and hostile aspects of human existence. These deliberate patterns of conflict have existed on Earth for thousands of years.
Acheson’s strategy of persuading Truman to adopt in 1949 relied on a dark but coherent worldview. Although Acheson is the son of an Episcopal bishop, he is not a traditional devout believer, but he still absorbs the cosmology of the Bible—especially the contradictory aspects of understanding human will. On the one hand, human beings are free and powerful; on the other hand, unfettered freedom necessarily leads to war and destruction. Acheson later explained that he believes that ""force and violence"" is cold, but it is an inevitable reality in the human world. Acheson pointed out that the enemies of the United States, such as those such as Stalin and Mao Zedong, are savvyly based on the strategy of ""strength estimation."" If the United States intends to survive in this dangerous world, it needs to do the same thing - but it needs to be cautious.
Perhaps Acheson’s worldview is not so cheerful and optimistic, but it is not without hope. For Acheson, the first step in the ruthless world is to try to see the reality. From the perspective of tragedy, it is recognized that the enemy of the United States is only a human being. It is affected by the same weaknesses and judgment errors, and even has a comforting effect. Most importantly, the tragic worldview, with its suspicion of the boundaries of human reason, opens the way for ultimate redemption. As Kennan wrote in his diary, the worldview of ""recognizing the limitations of human wisdom and allowing real tragedy situations to exist"" also recognizes the possibility of ""a solution that is not easily detectable by humans..."".

For Mao Zedong, he did not engage in these metaphysical speculations. He believes that when exercising the human will, there is no such thing as a contradiction, only to see if the opportunity exists. When Mao Zedong was a student, he wrote his thoughts on the edge of a textbook: ""Some people say that we must believe that the moral law comes from the command of God, because only then can it be executed without being despised. But in fact, this is A servile mentality. Why do you obey God instead of obeying yourself?"" In the years after the victory of 1949, Mao Zedong seemed to use this consciousness as his template - tolerate ever-expanding personal worship and bold Trying to overthrow the notion of ancient Chinese orthodoxy.
Mao Zedong’s post-war policies include ambitious, Don Quixote-style social and economic transformation. In the Great Leap Forward Movement that began in the late 1950s, Mao Zedong tried to force China into the modern era by fiercely transforming its economy. He is eager to upgrade China's industrial and agricultural output, setting unrealistic goals for steel and grain production – and then demanding these goals through a series of drastic reforms. China's rural areas have been reorganized into people's communes, and Mao Zedong hopes to increase efficiency through economic scale and division of labor. At the same time, individuals and communes are making steel in the backyard, hoping to increase production. The countryside can hear the patriotic songs of the workers sing ""Super Ying and America"".
However, Mao Zedong did not have economic experience, and the Great Leap Forward brought a huge disaster. The steel produced in the backyard steelmaking furnace is useless, but it takes up labor that can be used elsewhere. The innovations of farming methods—some of which were conceived by Mao Zedong himself—produced a variety of absurd practices: imaginative but unrealistic novelties, including endless breeding of artichokes and sunflowers, pumpkins, and papayas. Unfortunately, a series of harsh climates – including typhoons and floods in some parts of China, and ruthless droughts in other areas – have exacerbated the pain. The peasants are looking for leaves, bark and worms to eat, and they are desperate to survive. About 20 to 30 million farmers have starved to death due to the failure of reform and the subsequent famine.
However, Mao Zedong’s regime survived the scourge caused by this crazy decision and survived. In the 1960s, he devoted himself to transforming Chinese society. He and his allies launched the so-called ""Proletarian Cultural Revolution"" movement in the late 1960s, attempting to eliminate the last traces of the influence of the bourgeoisie and purify the country. The believers of Mao Zedong regarded it as an extension of the logic of revolution in 1949, and continued the transformation that was not completed due to realistic considerations. Now Mao Zedong’s faithful believers say, ""As long as everything that does not conform to the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat should be punished."" They organized the radical youths as Red Guards, sent them to mark the old culture and attacked Chinese intellectuals or even any political enemies they thought were not old.
In this massacre, the personal worship of Mao Zedong reached its peak. The pilgrim waved ""Mao Quotations"" and traveled for several days to visit the ""Great Helmsman"" in the past ""Revolutionary Holy Land."" The passion of nationalism is often expressed as a sharp fanaticism. Fanatic followers shouted anti-American slogans and waved imaginary bayonets. However, in the end, this originally chaotic movement began to split, triggering a series of internal destructive violence, seriously hurting the Chinese economy, and undermining Mao Zedong’s reputation abroad.
Even so, Mao Zedong continues to see himself as a key player on the world stage, providing weapons and personnel to assist revolutionary parties around the world, such as the Ho Chi Minh guerrillas in Vietnam. In the late 1960s, the Vietnam War, known as the ""bastardlegacy"" of 1949, was in full swing. The wars of increasing casualties and increased separatism have forced Truman and Acheson, who have retired for many years, to reassess the consequences of their containment policy in Asia. Linden. President Lyndon Johnson understands that the war that the Truman administration was heading toward in the first year of the year has now jeopardized his administration, so he often tries to win the decision of the former president to support him in raising the Vietnam War – even several times to go to independence. The city visited the old Truman and asked him for help. At least in public, Truman is silent.
However, Acheson does not offer advice. In 1967, Acheson told Jensen at a meeting of the White House: ""Of course we should not withdraw from Vietnam."" He added that only by demonstrating the determination of the United States can he persuade Ho Chi Minh to abandon his attempt to South Vietnam. However, in the following year, due to the Tet Offensive launched by the Communist Party of Vietnam and the economic crisis in the United States and the United Kingdom, Acheson began to lose confidence in the Vietnam War. He now advised Jensen to withdraw from Vietnam and focus on areas where he can do it – mainly in Europe.
However, the strategy developed by Truman and Acheson in 1949 also points to the policy of more friendly to Beijing adopted by President Nixon 20 years later. By the 1970s, Nixon wanted to withdraw from Vietnam and push for a policy of overturning Mao Zedong in the United States for decades. Over the years, the relationship between Moscow and Beijing has gradually worn out, in part because the United States has tried to incite the two communist powers to confront each other. Although Nixon’s strategy and Acheson’s strategy are not the same, the two people do have a common sense of the same: trying to encourage China and the Soviet Union will benefit the United States. In February 1972, Nixon became the first US president to visit China and meet with Mao Zedong. At this time, Mao Zedong became a dictator who was ""isolated, obsessed with fat, muttered to himself, and drooled from time to time."" Nearly seven years later, Washington finally recognized the People’s Republic of China – ending the 30-year diplomatic marginal policy.

In his later years, Acheson was not pleased by the gradual loss of Beijing and Moscow. The Chinese problem has tarnished his once-famous reputation; the anti-communist on the right and the anti-war protesters on the left are a pity for him. Finally, the legacy of 1949 - although Acheson has done the most in some areas - including not recognizing the Communist China for 30 years, supporting Taiwan for decades, and the Korean and Vietnamese wars. . Acheson accused the ""fanatic pursuit of the gods"", as soon as it involves the debate in China, immediately ""blooded into the ears."" But his worldview has always maintained a theological color. One time at an air base in Alabama, Acheson cited a poem by G. K. Chesterton, a writer who studied human psychology. Acheson read: ""I tell you, not to comfort you / yes, not because you are looking forward to / except the sky is getting darker and the sea is rising."" More than a year later, Acheson was in Maryland. The country house died of a stroke at the age of 78.
Truman also felt the blow and betrayal of the collapse of China. In a sense, he never gave up the desire to save the focus of trouble in the distance. In his departure farewell speech, he said: ""I have a deep and lasting belief in the fate of the free man. With patience and courage, we will one day enter a new era - a beautiful golden age - we can use science Peace tools for us to eradicate poverty and human suffering everywhere."" However, Truman realized that he was far from reaching this ideal, especially on the Chinese issue. After Truman stepped down, one time, when filming a documentary about his East Asian policy, the filmmaker noticed that the former president had repeatedly sneaked into the next room with a bottle of bourbon that had been opened. As the words became more and more incoherent, Truman began to talk nonsense, yelling at ""Qing Ke"" and ""Yellow Skin"". The producer couldn't stand it and fled the room in disgust. A year after the death of Acheson - a few months after Nixon visited Beijing - Truman died of illness.
By the 1970s, Mao Zedong’s reputation was as bad as Truman and Acheson because of his own policies. Just like the other winners of 1949, time and destiny are ruthless. Although the enthusiasm of Mao Zedong in China has reached its peak, foreign politicians are laughing at his low energy except China. In his later years, even Mao Zedong, who has always been arrogant and talked about human will, seems to have begun to understand and ease. He was interviewed by an American journalist at the Forbidden City apartment. When he was drinking Maotai, he mentioned that human beings need to worship something or someone. The Chinese leader seems to be more and more mindful of his death. He told the reporter that even he would ""go to see God soon."" With the arrival of 1976, he suffered from multiple heart attacks; in September, Mao Zedong died.
Zhou Yide has long lived in Mao Zedong for nearly 20 years and was able to see the first flash of the economic rise of the People’s Republic of China. He felt that he was betrayed by President Nixon’s policy of opening to China, and he wrote to Nixon to protest this ""sharp big flip."" Even in the 1980s, Zhou Yide still strongly protested the threat posed by the Beijing government. He can't understand that there have been decades of factual evidence why Americans still can't see the true nature of the Chinese Communist regime. In 1982, Zhou Yide appeared in William. After the television program ""Firing Line"" hosted by William F. Buckley, I received a letter from the audience: Song Meiling, 85, praised him for continuously exposing the ""beast"" of the Chinese Communist regime and blaming "" Resentful, arrogant and subversive leftist group, the wrong strategy in the past. As in the past 50 years, Zhou Yide continued to travel and speak for many years. Finally, he died in 1994, at the age of 95.
After returning to Taiwan, Song Meiling settled with her husband in a granite villa on the northern suburbs of Taipei. This cozy apartment is full of colorful rhododendrons and orchids. She paints, prays and thinks about plans. Taiwan’s brutal suppression under her husband’s rule suppressed political dissidents. But after Jiang Zhongzheng’s death in 1975, the political atmosphere on the island gradually became less high. It is also economically prosperous and has become one of the most dynamic regions in East Asia. It is known as one of the ""Asian Four Little Dragons"". As the former hostility subsided, Song Meiling returned to the United States and finally bought an apartment in the eastern district of Manhatan. She is here to reflect, recalling ""the tense period of the year, the days of deep anxiety, the moment of encountering and overcoming disobedience"", these scenes ""like a kaleidoscope, one by one flashing through my mind."" When the twentieth century finally turned to the 21st century, she had already celebrated her 100th birthday. Among the many fighters in 1949, she lived the longest.

The destiny continues to evolve. Song Meiling died in 2003 and is 100 years old. After more than a decade of her death, East Asia continues to evolve. Now, we can fly from New York to Beijing in less than fourteen hours, but we can no longer see China in 1949. The former China has long been eliminated by the two digital economic growth rates, government reform and ideology purification. Although modern Chinese politicians are highly acclaimed for Mao Zedong, China's flourishing development is not due to Mao Zedong's influence. Mao Zedong’s successor continued to carry out market reforms and played a more important role in China’s economic rise in the 21st century. However, some scholars still reminded that it is wrong to completely deny the purification of the Mao Zedong revolution. They compare it with the ""forest fire"", which is destructive and lays the foundation for ""new growth.""
Regardless of the reason, China is once again unable to ignore it. When its stock market falls, the world will pay close attention. When its navy strengthens its work on an island reef in the South China Sea, the superpower is fidgeting. Beijing’s policy and military leaders are worried about the modern version of the US containment policy, but in fact, the battle is long over. Whether it is good or bad, China has already integrated into the global economy. A famous Chinese general recently announced that his country ""will never be blocked again."" Basically, he is right.
Having said that, the echoes of 1949 were everywhere. Americans are still debating how to best respond to a vibrant China – whether it's in contact with or against its leaders; if so, where to draw a red line. The most volatile region in 1949 is still one of the most unstable regions today. In particular, the future of Taiwan does not seem as reassuring as it has been in the past few years. The politics of the island – partly shaped by the immigrants who moved to Taiwan in 1949 when Mao Zedong was victorious in the mainland – is still very tricky. Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang once ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, and now it can no longer act arbitrarily. In the 2016 presidential election, Tsai Ing-wen, elected by the Taiwanese, was the second president of the Democratic Progressive Party outside the Chiang Kai-shek. Domestic politics is the least worrying issue in Taipei. Although President Trump’s unpredictable ways of dealing with East Asian affairs have encouraged some Taiwanese, others are more worried that rash provocation will only further destabilize East Asia.
At the same time, as long as it is politically useful, Beijing leaders are never afraid to try to recreate the magic of 1949. This kind of nationalism is particularly attractive when the economy is unstable. At this time, military invincibility can distract the attention of the people. However, even in the boom years, historical memories have attractive powers. Spread throughout modern China, there are signs everywhere pointing to revolutionary history filled with heroes, villains and victims. In the memorial hall of the old base of Mao Zedong in Xibaipo, as the tourists walked, you can see a sentence posted by Xi Jinping on the wall: ""The mission has not been completed."" This is a good reminder that the civil war in 1949 is not over yet. .

In 2019, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the US-China trade war is awkward, and anxious Chinese officials and official media are in the same enemy. They believe that today's US policy is a sequel to the containment strategy that emerged in 1949. They are worried about the deployment and training tasks of US troops in East Asia, and they are also paying close attention to hotspots such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. They suspect that the United States wants to succumb to it as before.
To understand today's US-China relations, you must understand the history of 70 years ago. ""Strong Power"" takes us back to thisThe scene of historical turnaround.
In the first few months of 1949, US President Truman faced an imminent diplomatic catastrophe. Throughout the spring and summer, Mao Zedong’s Communist forces spread across mainland China, annihilating the troops of US ally Chiang Kai-shek and controlling Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities. Truman and his assistants, including the savvy and ruthless Secretary of State Dean. Acheson is busy dealing with the rapidly changing situation, not only to fight against Mao Zedong, but also to deal with the fierce attacks by domestic political opponents. Truman and Acheson even ruthlessly accuse Chiang Kai-shek of the negatives of the white paper and acknowledge that Mao Zedong’s revolution has exceeded the influence of the United States. In this process, the role of the United States, from the government organization to many other people, its policy planning and formulation, many bold assumptions and the once-conceived suggestions, the ""wrong"" situation of the Kuomintang civil war, many As a negative inaction, it has a profound influence on the later US-China relations.
In this turbulent year, Mao Zedong established a new revolutionary government in Beijing, laying the foundation for building a modern China, while Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the Taiwan base. These events changed the US foreign policy, which eventually led to decades of friction between Washington and the Communist China, the US's long-term commitment to Taiwan, and the subsequent wars in North Korea and Vietnam.
In response to the response of Mao Zedong’s victory, US policymakers have also had heated debates. Some people want to deal with Mao Zedong, some want to fight against him, and some people do not want to pay attention to him. Among these different claims, there are still many nuances. These disputes are not only tactical differences of opinion, but also reflect deep differences in the nature of US-China relations and the contradictions of the United States itself. At the end of 1949, the United States extended the policy of containment of communism, which was mainly limited to Europe, to Asia. The Truman administration has developed an ambitious plan – including a series of secret operations – to support China's neighboring countries. Even if Mao Zedong consolidated its control over the mainland, the United States quietly provided money and weapons to his enemies.
The author of the book Kevin.裴Leno cites documents from China and Russia, and recently the files declassified by the CIA, which are elaborately laid out and snarled, revealing many historically unknown history. He tells the story of this extraordinary year through the eyes of the main participants, including Mao Zedong, President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, Minnesota Congressman Zhou Yide, and Chiang Kai-shek’s wife Song Meiling, cleverly intertwining several different main lines. And with the perspective of international politics, let us see a richer historical image.
Kevin.裴Lenno delicately reconstructs the ins and outs of the whole year, changes the flow, and describes how history is progressing step by step with the continuation, calculation and miscalculation of the actors. Among them, we saw that US President Truman and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Acheson have been embarrassed from time to time, and they have seen how the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Kai-shek are intertwined, and the Republic of China is influential. How does a lady Song Meiling manage her strategy? With the change of the current situation, the camps of the parties have also made adjustments to keep pace with the times.
Today, the significance of the 1949 era, the relationship between China, the United States and the rest of the world is more important than ever. Because Beijing has raised sovereignty over the South China Sea, tensions between Taiwan and the mainland still exist. In this work exploring the victory of the Chiang Kai-shek government in 1949 and the victory of Mao Zedong's communist forces, this extraordinary political revolution still affects East Asian politics.
