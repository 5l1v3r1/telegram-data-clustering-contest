      <p><b>BURLINGTON, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A state trooper has been attacked while trying to break up a domestic assault.</p>
      <p>Massachusetts State Police said Monday that Trooper Michael Sierra was patrolling Route 2 Sunday afternoon when he noticed a car stopped on the side of the road.</p>
      <p>Police say as Sierra approached the car, a man got out and charged at him. Officials say Sierra eventually subdued him and determined he'd been assaulting two women in the car.</p>
      <p>Police say one was the man's relative and the other was a friend.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Lowell man was taken to Lahey Hospital in Burlington for a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
      <p>Police say he isn't being named because the state's domestic violence law prohibits it. But they say he faces assault and battery, driving under the influence and other charges.</p>
