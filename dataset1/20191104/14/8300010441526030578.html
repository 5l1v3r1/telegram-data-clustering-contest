      <p>For a group of high school students in Humble, Texas, their mission to help ALS patients is personal. <br/><br/>Last year, robotics teacher Joe Paneitz and his students created a device called "Linda's Laptote" for a retired teacher with ALS.<br/><br/>Linda Kenworthy, a beloved former P.E. coach, is now wheelchair-bound and has lost the ability to speak with her own voice. She uses her Laptote every day to perform tasks more easily. <br/><br/>Now, students are hoping to patent the Laptote in order to help even more patients with ALS.</p>
