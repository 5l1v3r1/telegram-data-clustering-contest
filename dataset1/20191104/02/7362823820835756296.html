      <h1>Cleveland Browns' Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry ordered to change out of their colorful cleats</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> receivers <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/odell-beckham-jr">Odell Beckham Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/browns-jarvis-landry-daughter-fawn-encounter">Jarvis Landry</a> put their team in jeopardy Sunday by wearing cleats that ran afoul of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">NFL</a> rules during their decisive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> matchup.</p>
      <p>Beckham was wearing “Joker”-inspired cleats, and Landry had on gold cleats, in a game their team eventually <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/odell-beckham-jarvis-landry-told-to-change-cleats-or-not-play-in-second-half-225821943.html">lost</a>, 24-19, in Denver.</p>
      <p>Landry (six catches for 51 yards) and Beckham (five catches for 87 yards) were forced to change their colorful footwear at halftime to conform to the league’s dress code.</p>

      <p>Beckham memorably was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/odell-beckham-jr-watch-nfl-rules-browns">reprimanded for wearing a nearly $200,000 watch</a> during the Browns' opener against the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a>. He said the only reason it was an issue was because he was wearing it.</p>

      <p>A league rule prohibits players from wearing hard objects.</p>
      <p>The following week, league officials sent him off the field during an away game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">New York</a> Jets because they said his helmet visor was too dark.</p>

      <p>In a letter from the league that he later posted to his Instagram, Beckham revealed he was fined more than $14,000 after officials found him to be in “violation of the NFL Uniform and Equipment Rules.”</p>
      <p>“Specifically, your pants failed to cover the knee area,” the letter went on to say.</p>
