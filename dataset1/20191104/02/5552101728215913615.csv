【少主反攻2】擔憂生意囝歹生　銜銀湯匙長大的他被父親送到日本磨練

去年6月中，艾美特創辦人史鴻堯長子史瑞斌接任董事長，找不到跟壓力相處的模式，他每天晚上得靠吃鎮定劑才能入睡。「有句俗語說『生意囝歹生』。」史瑞斌苦笑，「屬於第二代，我自己壓力很大。」操盤年收百億元的企業，令他壓力劇增，更擔心追不上父親的成就。



1973年，電機學徒出身的史鴻堯在台南創立「東富電器」，代工小家電。「一開始做風扇電機，但只做單季看天吃飯的生意很辛苦，才衍生出相應的電暖器、溫度調節器和加濕器。」

因台灣生產成本上揚，1990年，史鴻堯前往深圳設立「威昂電器」，和威昂第一任總經理李博輝與副總李麗珠，從利潤較低的風扇和電暖器OEM轉做ODM，當年年底又與艾美特現任副董事長蔡正富合作，隔年公司更名為「艾美特電器」。
父母忙於工作，史瑞斌從小寄養在姑婆家，「週末我爸會來看我，我對他雖能感受到父愛，但又有距離、很尷尬的心態。」

或許是為了彌補無法陪伴孩子的缺憾，「國中時，父親的生意已經蠻成功。我不敢說我是含著金湯匙長大，但是銀湯匙總是有的，又是備受寵愛的長男，要什麼就有什麼，講真的我爸對我有點溺愛。」史瑞斌高職畢業後，父親便安排他赴日磨練。
「我人生的第一個轉捩點，就是在日本的那5年。」前3年史瑞斌在東京和名古屋求學，後2年則進入艾美特客戶、日本湯淺株式會社的子公司上班。「以前我不懂事，反正就是伸手，到了日本才知道，原來吃一頓飯要這麼多錢。」史瑞斌逗趣地說：「我學著去超市買菜回來煮，可是豬肉沒煮熟就吃下去，肚子搞壞、有幽門桿菌，還回台就醫。」
