      <p>Cenk Tosun's stoppage-time header earned Everton a 1-1 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday in a match overshadowed by a bad-looking injury to Everton midfielder Andre Gomes.</p>
      <p>LIVERPOOL: Cenk Tosun's stoppage-time header earned Everton a 1-1 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday in a match overshadowed by a bad-looking injury to Everton midfielder Andre Gomes.</p>
      <p>Dele Alli's goal just past the hour mark appeared to have ended Tottenham's long wait for a Premier League away win.</p>

      <p>Spurs were reduced to 10 men in the 79th minute when Son Heung-min's tackle on Gomes resulted in the Portuguese midfielder suffering what looked to be a bad leg injury.</p>
      <p>South Korean forward Son looked distraught as he realised the extent of the injury to Gomes who was carried off on a stretcher after a lengthy delay.</p>
      <p>Alli fired low past home keeper Jordan Pickford in the 63rd minute of a drab game after former Arsenal player Alex Iwobi's misplaced pass had gifted possession to Son.</p>
      <p>Everton were denied a penalty when the ball appeared to inadvertently brush against Alli's hand as he challenged for an aerial ball but after a three-minute delay for a VAR check referee Martin Atkinson did not award the hosts a spot kick.</p>
      <p>Substitute Tosun denied Tottenham victory when he headed home deep into the time added on for the Gomes injury.</p>
      <p>Tottenham, still without an away league win since January, moved into 11th spot in the standings with Everton in 17th.</p>
