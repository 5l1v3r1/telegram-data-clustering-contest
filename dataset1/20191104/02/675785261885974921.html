      <p>Simon Cowell is preparing to to launch a new ITV show that will directly rival his former protégées Little Mix’s new BBC talent search.</p>
      <p>Simon has decided to scrap the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> All Stars series set to launch on ITV next month, instead focusing on finding the next big girl group and boy band, report The Sun.</p>
      <p>The new show will be called X Factor: The Band and will be in direct competition to Little Mix’s BBC One prime time talent hunt ‘The Search’, set to launch in the new year.</p>
      <p>Little Mix were hand picked by Simon, 60, in 2011 after he chose Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards and Leigh-Anne Pinnock to form a new girl band.</p>

      <p>The girls were represented by Simon’s record label Syco, releasing four albums under the banner.</p>
      <p>However, the girls parted ways with the record label after seven years after falling out with their managers Modest! last year.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun, Simon has now claimed that he came up with the idea of a new talent show first and has moved it forward to directly compete with the girls.</p>

      <p>He said: “This is what really happened. I was approached to co-produce that show last year by Little Mix’s management.</p>
      <p>“I told them the problem was we have a conflict of interest because we are launching X Factor The Band in 2020. We were told their show was going to launch in 2021.</p>
      <p>“Then we had the fallout and find out Little Mix were bringing their show forward. Was that intentional because we are doing our show? I have no idea.”</p>

      <p>The music mogul added that the “battle” would be “100% exciting”.</p>
      <p>Auditions for the new ITV show will begin soon at London’s Sony Music, with the live finals set to be held at the Birmingham Arena in December.</p>
      <p>Little Mix’s BBC offering will see talented singers put into either all-girl, all-boy or mixed bands.</p>
      <p>They will then compete against each other with the girls acting as mentors.</p>
      <p>The winning group then join Little Mix on their summer tour in 2020.</p>
