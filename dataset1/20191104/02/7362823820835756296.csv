Cleveland Browns receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry put their team in jeopardy Sunday by wearing cleats that ran afoul of NFL rules during their decisive Denver Broncos matchup.
Beckham was wearing “Joker”-inspired cleats, and Landry had on gold cleats, in a game their team eventually lost, 24-19, in Denver.
