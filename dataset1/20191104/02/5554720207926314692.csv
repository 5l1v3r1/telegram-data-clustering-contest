India’s richest woman Nita Ambani may not have held a public celebration to mark her 56th birthday on 1 November, but this did not stop netizens to extend their profound greetings to the mother-in-law of Shloka Mehta and Anand Piramal.



Leading the pack to extend their birthday greetings were fashion designer Manish Malhotra and celebrity photographer Dabboo Ratnani. Manish took to Instagram to share, not one but two, photographs of Nita Ambani. In the first photo of Nita shared by Manish, India’s richest woman was seen posing for the camera in orange lehenga choli with zari work.
Manish wrote, “Beautiful and Regal #nitaambani birthday wishes lots of love and regard.”



Another post by Manish on Nita’s birthday read, “Happy birthday dearest @nitaambanioffical #nitaambani you are just fabulous .. warmest rRegards . Respect and love 💓 stay beautiful.” In this photo, Nita Ambani was seen dressed in an embellished pink lehenga choli.



Dabboo too shared a photo of Nita while wishing her on her birthday. He wrote, “Beauty , Grace & A Whole Lot Of Heart 🌸✨❤️ Happy Birthday Nita Mam ! ♥️🙏🏼🌺 Love & Warmest Regards.”
Standing in the backdrop of the Taj Palace in Udaipur, Nita Ambani was described as a woman with a vision of beauty and grace. Dressed in long-sleeved black and white long-sleeved and bell-bottom separates, Nita Ambani indeed looked magnificent with diamond accessories.



Aside from top Bollywood celebrities, ordinary netizens too took to Instagram to wish Nita Ambani on her birthday. One user shared a photo of her with Amitabh Bachchan’s daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai, who shares her birthday with the chairperson of Reliance Foundation. While Aishwarya was dressed in a silver and maroon lehenga choli seemingly readying for performance, Nita Ambani was dressed in pink slacks and a shimmery pink jacket.



Nita married Mukesh in 1985 and has three kids Akash, Isha and Anant. Akash tied the knot to Shloka Mehta in March this year, while Isha married Anand Piramal last year.
