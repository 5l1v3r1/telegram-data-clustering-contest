      <p>BORDEAUX: Bordeaux captain Benoit Costil said South Korea's Hwang Ui-jo is the "bee's knees" after the forward scored his second goal in four Ligue 1 appearances in Sunday's (Nov 3) 2-0 victory over Nantes.</p>
      <p>Hwang, 27, who joined the French club from Gamba Osaka for â‚¬2 million (US$2.2 million) in July, claimed his third goal of the league campaign as Bordeaux moved up to sixth in the table.</p>

      <p>"His settling in time has been minimal. He's very efficient. What he's been doing has been the bee's knees," Costil said.</p>
      <p>"I prefer to have Hwang with us rather than against us," he added.</p>
      <p>Coach Paulo Sousa also praised the 29-time international who set up Francois Kamano for the opening goal of the game with a precise pass with the outside of his foot.</p>
      <p>"Hwang is starting to understand his positioning and has better communication with his team-mates," the Portuguese boss said.</p>
      <p>"With every match he's starting to be decisive, to show his physical ability. He's an important type of player for us," he added.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Patrick Vieira's Nice won for the first time in six games denying Reims the chance to move to second in the table with a 2-0 victory.</p>
      <p>Wylan Cyprien and Christophe Herelle scored after Mali international Moussa Doumbia was sent off in the first half for the visitors.</p>
      <p>In the final game of the day, Saint-Etienne continued their resurgence under Claude Puel as Denis Bouanga's second-half effort was enough to beat Monaco 1-0 to claim their third win in four games under the former Leicester boss.</p>
