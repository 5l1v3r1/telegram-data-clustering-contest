廣東市民：公安部插手賣口罩網店，不讓發貨

04 Nov 2019, 02:32

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】新唐人收到網友來信，全文刊登如下：
編輯你好：我因感冒，於10月26日在京東購買了一隻霧霾口罩，地址範圍在廣東省惠州市。店家遲遲未發貨，到第四天時給我發短信聲稱接到公安部通知，口罩之類的產品無法發貨，要我申請退款。
第一反應是感到驚訝。我知道香港現在局勢很亂，出了蒙面法，但這和廣東省有何關係？難道不讓賣口罩就能止亂了嗎？今後再買口罩，是不是還得問：你買口罩做什麼用？要人寫下保證書不上街才准買呀？政治對於老百姓來說都是遙遠的，大多數人只是想過安定的生活，只要不涉及到老百姓的人身安危，上面怎麼作大家管不了，也沒那個話語權。
可是現在這樣的做法實在瘋狂，而且滑稽。雖是一件微不足道的小事，但由此可見一斑，相信不止我一個人遇到了這樣的事，大大小小的賣口罩面罩的店想必都受到了管制。現在正是換季，本來就是流感高發時期，大家買口罩原本也無可厚非，但公安這樣的做法實在毫無道理，提供此信息，即便改變不了什麼，也希望媒體能發揮輿論的優勢，讓更多人知道，謝謝。

Guangdong citizens: The Ministry of Public Security intervened to sell masks online stores, not to allow shipments

04 Nov 2019, 02:32

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] New Tang Dynasty received a letter from a netizen. The full text is as follows:
Hello, Editor: I bought a smog mask in Jingdong on October 26 due to a cold. The address range is Huizhou City, Guangdong Province. The store has not delivered the goods lately. When I sent the text message on the fourth day, I claimed that I received a notice from the Ministry of Public Security that the products such as masks could not be shipped, so I would request a refund.
The first reaction was surprised. I know that the situation in Hong Kong is very chaotic and there is a masked law. But what is the relationship with Guangdong Province? Don't you let the masks stop? If you buy a mask in the future, do you have to ask: What do you use for a mask? Do you want to buy a guarantee that you don’t go to the street to buy it? Politics is far away for the common people. Most people just want to live a stable life. As long as they don't involve the personal safety of the people, how can we do it, and we don't have the right to speak.
But now this is crazy and funny. Although it is a trivial little thing, it can be seen that I believe that more than one person has encountered such a thing, large and small stores selling masks must be controlled. It is the season of change. It was originally a period of high incidence of influenza. It is understandable that people buy masks. But the practice of public security is really unreasonable. Providing this information, even if nothing changes, I hope that the media can give advantage of public opinion and let more people Thank you, thank you.
