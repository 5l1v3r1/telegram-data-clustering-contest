大陸佛寺宣誓「忠黨愛國」 老信徒透露：被逼的

04 Nov 2019, 02:59

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】中共當局以無神論立國，強制宗教界上演忠黨愛國等鬧劇，各地寺廟、僧人被強迫宣誓「忠黨愛國」、「共築中國夢」、唱「紅歌」等。有年邁信徒憤慨斥責，如今佛門淨地在中共強權下，正宗的佛教教義已逐漸消失。
近日，專門報導中國人權與宗教新聞的《寒冬》雜誌（Bitter Winter）稱，為慶祝中共建政70週年，河南禹州市梁北鎮關聖禪院內，一名佛教法師帶領信眾高呼愛國口號，「愛國愛教，不忘初心，共築中國夢。」
接著，眾信徒聚集在旗台旁，進行升五星旗儀式，眾僧人、信徒揮舞小五星旗、高唱《義勇軍進行曲》。升旗儀式結束後，一眾信徒在宗教局官員的指令下，高呼「祖國萬歲，阿彌陀佛」，接著再合唱愛國歌謠《我的祖國》。
活動期間一名佛教法師獨唱《我的中國心》，16名女信徒在中共紅歌的伴奏下跳舞，表達所謂的「忠黨愛國」之情懷。
當地一名信徒說，參加這場活動的除寺廟僧侶外，還有禹州市宗教局、佛教協會官員。
當地一名年邁信徒氣憤怒斥，「如今的佛門淨地在中共的強權下，被整治得不倫不類。法師不像法師，和尚不像和尚」、「這樣發展下去，正宗的佛教教義就會逐漸消失」。
這名年邁信徒無奈感嘆，中共當局定期審查宗教活動場所登記證，要是寺廟不配合，就無法通過下一次的登記證審查。
最可悲的是，佛教徒被禁止唱佛曲。
9月26日，河南安陽市殷都區金祥寺內的慶祝活動上，一名佛教徒向中共官員請求唱一首佛教歌曲，遭官員斷然拒絕：「不能唱佛教的歌，只能唱擁戴共產黨的歌」。
9月21日，江西廬山市萬杉寺在的中共建政70年的交流會中，僧人也被要求宣誓「忠黨愛國」。

駭人的佛教亂象

佛道之門本應是信徒修身養性、清心寡慾，追求極樂世界的殿堂，然而，在中共的統治下，佛道之門已經成了黑門黑道、胡作非為之地。
《九評共產黨》一書記述，中共在建政之初，就對佛教、道教和基督教進行三教齊滅，對宗教進行暴虐鎮壓和對會道門全面取締。不但毀寺焚經，強迫僧尼還俗，對其它宗教場所的破壞也從未手軟。文革時的「破四舊」更是一場宗教和文化的浩劫。
中共還著重從內部破壞宗教。1952年成立的中國佛教協會，與1957年成立的中國道教協會，明確要求「在人民政府領導下」，也就是在「無神論」的共產黨領導之下。
時至今日，中共對宗教的控制變本加厲，但手法就更加隱密。
2015年6月份，時任中共統戰部長孫春蘭兩度就宗教事務講話。要求宗教界人士「在關鍵時刻起作用」。之後，政治和尚紛紛站出來表忠。
中共「十九大」召開之前，大陸各級政府部門掀起向「十九大」表衷心，唱「讚歌」的活動，「喜迎十九大」的橫幅隨處可見。網上還流傳一群和尚在台上為「十九大」唱「讚歌」，舞台掛的橫幅也是「喜迎十九大」。
中共媒體還宣揚，佛教協會副會長印順出席海南省佛教協會舉辦的「十九大精神培訓班」。他倡議佛教徒手抄「十九大」報告，並且宣稱自己已手抄3遍，還準備再抄10遍。
中共統治下、無神論教育下的中國，真可謂無奇不有，有些現象人們已經見怪不怪了。
大紀元發表的《共產主義的終極目的 中國篇》第四章中，提及當中共用利益和商業化的手法魔變宗教，中共控制下的宗教團體已經變成了中共的搖錢樹和打擊異己的工具時，這種所謂的宗教信仰也就變異成對邪靈的無神論、唯物主義的信仰。
於是信仰失去了意義，信徒沒有了歸宿，人們斷了回歸的路，這時中共不公開迫害也達到了毀滅人的目的。

The Continental Buddha Temple swears ""loyal party patriotism"" Old believers revealed: forced

04 Nov 2019, 02:59

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The Chinese Communist Party established a state of atheism and forced the religious circles to stage patriotism and patriotism. The temples and monks were forced to swear ""loyal party patriotism"", ""build a Chinese dream together"" and sing "" Red song"" and so on. There are elderly believers who indignantly reprimanded. Nowadays, under the CCP’s power, the authentic Buddhist teachings have gradually disappeared.
Recently, Bitter Winter, which specializes in Chinese human rights and religious news, said that in order to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, a Buddhist mage led the believers in the Guansheng Temple in Liangbei Town, Chenzhou City, Henan Province. Slogan, ""Patriotic love and education, do not forget the original heart, build a Chinese dream together.""
Then, the believers gathered at the flag platform to carry out the five-star flag ceremony. The monks and believers waved the small five-star flag and sang the ""Music of the Volunteers."" After the flag-raising ceremony, a group of believers shouted ""Long live the motherland, Amitabha"" under the instructions of the officials of the religious bureau, and then sang the patriotic song ""My Motherland.""
During the event, a Buddhist mage sang ""My Chinese Heart"", and 16 female believers danced under the accompaniment of the Chinese Communist Party's red song, expressing the so-called ""loyalty and patriotism"".
A local believer said that in addition to the temple monks who participated in the event, there were officials from the Shengzhou Religious Affairs Bureau and the Buddhist Association.
An old local believer angered and angered, ""Now the buddhist land is rectified under the CCP's power. The Master is not like a mage, the monk is not like a monk."" ""This way, the authentic Buddhist teachings will gradually disappear."" .
The elderly believer can not help but sigh, the Chinese authorities regularly review the registration certificate for religious activities, and if the temple does not cooperate, it will not be able to pass the next registration certificate.
The saddest thing is that Buddhists are forbidden to sing Buddha songs.
On September 26, at a celebration in Jinxiang Temple, Yindu District, Anyang City, Henan Province, a Buddhist asked the Chinese officials to sing a Buddhist song. The official categorically refused: ""You can't sing Buddhist songs, you can only sing and sing."" The song of the Communist Party.""
On September 21, in the 70-year exchange meeting of the Communist Party of China in Wanshan Temple in Shaoshan City, Jiangxi Province, the monks were also asked to swear ""loyal party patriotism.""

Buddhist chaos

The door of Buddhism and Taoism should be the temple where the believers cultivated their own self, cultivated their hearts and minds, and pursued the world of bliss. However, under the rule of the CCP, the door of Buddhism and Taoism has become a black-door gangster and a sinister place.
According to the book ""The Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party"", at the beginning of the establishment of the government, the CCP carried out three teachings on Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity, violent suppression of religion and total ban on the door. Not only did the temple burn down, the monks and nuns were forced to return to the customs, and the destruction of other religious sites was never soft. The ""breaking four old"" during the Cultural Revolution was a catastrophe of religion and culture.
The CCP also focuses on destroying religion from within. The Chinese Buddhist Association, established in 1952, and the Chinese Taoist Association, established in 1957, explicitly demanded that ""under the leadership of the people's government"", that is, under the leadership of the Communist Party under ""atheism.""
To this day, the CCP’s control over religion has intensified, but the tactics are even more insidious.
In June 2015, Sun Chunlan, then Minister of the United Front of the Communist Party of China, spoke twice on religious affairs. Religious people are required to ""act at a critical moment."" After that, political monks stood up and loyal.
Before the CCP's ""Nineteenth National Congress"" was held, government departments at all levels in the mainland set off their heartfelt wishes for the ""Nineteenth National Congress"" and sang ""praise songs"". The banners of ""Welcome to the Nineteenth National Congress"" were everywhere. On the Internet, a group of monks also sang ""praise songs"" on the stage for the ""Nineteenth National Congress"". The banners hanging on the stage are also ""welcome the 19th National Congress.""
The CCP media also publicized that the vice president of the Buddhist Association, Yin Shun, attended the ""Nineteen Spiritual Training Courses"" organized by the Buddhist Association of Hainan Province. He advocated that Buddhists handwritten the ""Nineteenth National Congress"" report and claimed that they had copied it three times and were prepared to copy it again.
Under the CCP's rule, China under the atheism education is really nothing, and some people have already seen it.
In the fourth chapter of the ""The Ultimate Purpose of Communism in China"" published by the Epoch Times, the reference to the shared interests and commercialization of the devils, the religious groups under the control of the CCP have become the CCP’s cash cow and tools to fight against dissidents. This so-called religious belief also mutates into atheistic and materialistic beliefs about evil spirits.
Then the faith lost its meaning, the believers did not have a home, and the people broke the road of return. At this time, the CCP did not openly persecute and reached the goal of destroying people.
