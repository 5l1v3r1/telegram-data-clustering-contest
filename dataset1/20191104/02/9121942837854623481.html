      <p>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Uganda’s government is denying that it intends to introduce a bill targeting homosexuals, dismissing claims by a senior official who wants such legislation.</p>
      <p>Esther Mbayo, minister in charge of the presidency, said in a statement Monday that the government “does not have any plans of reintroducing the anti-homosexuality bill on the floor of Parliament.”</p>
      <p>Simon Lokodo, minister for ethics and integrity, said last month there were efforts to bring a bill punishing offences such as the “promotion” of homosexuality. Lokodo’s comments alarmed Uganda’s gay community, whose leaders cite harassment and deadly attacks.</p>
      <p>The government’s statement Monday urged minority groups to report cases of abuse to the police.</p>
      <p>Uganda’s penal code criminalizes sex acts “against the order of nature.”</p>
      <p>In 2014, a court nullified a harsh anti-gay law amid international condemnation.</p>
