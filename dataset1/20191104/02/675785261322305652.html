      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T02:33:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 02:33</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A 'fake doctor' has been arrested after allegedly killing four patients and injuring eight others.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old woman stands accused of forging documents to secure a job as an assistant anaesthetist in Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim the allegedly unqualified doctor gave patients the wrong medication and incorrect doses at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit, in Fritzlar.</p>
      <p>She was employed as an anaesthetist between 2015 and 2017, before finally coming under investigation in February.</p>
      <p>The probe initially focused on her lack of credentials, however it expanded after she was linked to a series of deaths.</p>

      <p>In addition to medicine and dosage failures, it is claimed she did not pick up on some patients' struggles to breathe, the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/03/german-fake-doctor-may-have-killed-four-people-police-suspect/">Daily Telegraph</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The 'fake doctor', named as 'Meike W' by German media, <a href="https://www.hna.de/lokales/wolfhagen/bad-emstal-ort77281/vier-patienten-starben-falsche-aerztin-wollte-buergermeisterin-in-bad-emstal-werden-13190099.html">reportedly</a> stood as a mayoral candidate for Bad Emstal in Hesse, Germany, in 2012.</p>
      <p>Police raided her home and the Hospital of the Holy Spirit on Tuesday, arresting the suspect.</p>
      <p>The alleged fraudster, who has remained in custody since her arrest, reportedly worked as an assistant anaesthetist for two years before moving to a different part of the hospital in 2018.</p>
      <p>A six-year degree and another five years of training is required to become an anaesthetist in Germany, according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50264089">BBC</a> .</p>
      <p>The scandal comes after a fertility doctor was sued by a family who claim he used his own sperm to father their daughters instead of an anonymous donor.</p>
      <p>Cheryl Emmons has launched the lawsuit against Dr Paul Jones after her two daughters were contacted by a half-sibling through two ancestry websites.</p>
      <p>Mrs Emmons was artificially inseminated by the medic in 1980 and 1985 at the Womenâ€™s Health Care of Western Colorado and went on to give birth two Maia Emmons-Boring and Tahnee Scott.</p>
