【少主反攻4】他靠大數據止虧　1款電扇半年賣11億

從頭整頓龐大的事業體，史瑞斌一度身兼董事長、總經理等5個職務。想起父親從小耳提面命的叮嚀，「他常說做生意哪有什麼困難？就是開源跟節流。」早期建廠時，因深圳配套產業不足，艾美特產品自製率達95％，「外面買的品質不能控制，我們進口塑膠粒自己灌，風扇網子自己從鐵線開始做。」



史瑞斌一面加發績效獎金，同時大刀闊斧整併部門，並減少短期投資，「我一上來就把電子課關掉。以前我們的機板還用10年前的方式手動插件，這沒有競爭力、沒有價格優勢，現在都已經自動化了。」他將產品自製率降至65％，低端產品委外製造，「現在2019年了，深圳什麼沒有？」
「我沒辦法跟員工說我愛你們，對不起，公司沒賺錢。」史瑞斌坦言接任後，離開或調部門的高階主管超過15人，「改革一定有陣痛期，一定不習慣，我希望大家支持我、不是配合我。從以前的成績，我看不到不改的理由。」


史瑞斌去年接任董座後，一面加發績效獎金，同時大刀闊斧整併部門，並減少短期投資。

胡蘿蔔與棍子並行收到成效，今年上半年艾美特營收63.29億元，毛利率創6年單季新高。而為減少業績深受氣候冷熱影響，內部也成立用戶研究中心，以大數據分析消費者使用習慣，作為產品改良依據。
過去艾美特產品開發策略是「提早2年儲備」。史瑞斌說：「卡早阮爸說，開10套（模具）中2套就好，現在真的不行，一套模具都是新台幣近千萬元的投入。很多東西隨時在變，要有數據化、平台化，不是去猜消費者想要或應該會喜歡什麼。」
拿出一台藉由數據改良、今年上半年在中國銷量最好的循環扇，史瑞斌解釋，「傳統循環扇是矮個子，因為頭重、再做脖子就會倒，但我們克服了這個問題。」把循環扇的頸部拉長、可180度擺動，即使是開著暖氣的房間，也能讓空氣流通，打破風扇只能賣夏季的迷思。


去年6月接任董事長後，史瑞斌以胡蘿蔔與棍子並行，今年上半年艾美特營收63.29億元，毛利率創6年單季新高。

「在中國，你沒有領先同業的地方，真的是掰掰了。」史瑞斌說，這款循環扇單價人民幣1,499元（約新台幣6,500元），上半年賣了人民幣2.5億元（約新台幣11億元）。「現在消費者不要買便宜的東西，很多人要的是質。」多箭齊發下，被視為傳統淡季的第三季，今年也轉虧為盈，「這只是第一年，我要未來每年Q3都賺錢。」

[Little master counterattack 4] He relies on big data to stop losses 1 fan sells 1.1 billion for half a year
04 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Qiu Wanren, Lin Yuwei, Wu Mingwei
From the beginning to rectify a huge business, Shi Ruibin once served as chairman and general manager and other five positions. I remembered my father’s embarrassment from a younger ear. ""He often said that there is any difficulty in doing business? It is open source and throttling."" When the factory was built in the early days, due to the shortage of supporting industries in Shenzhen, the self-made rate of Emmett products reached 95%. Control, we import the plastic pellets ourselves, the fan nets themselves start from the iron wire.""



Shi Ruibin added performance bonuses at the same time, and at the same time drastically consolidated the department and reduced short-term investment. ""I turned off the e-learning as soon as I came up. In the past, our board also used manual plug-ins 10 years ago. This is not competitive, no. The price advantage has now been automated."" He reduced the product self-manufacturing rate to 65%, and the low-end products were made out of manufacturing. ""Now 2019, what is there in Shenzhen?""
""I can't tell employees that I love you. Sorry, the company didn't make any money."" Shi Ruibin said that after taking over, more than 15 senior executives left or transferred to the department. ""The reform must have a painful period and must not be used. I hope everyone will support me."" Not with me. From the previous results, I can't see the reason for not changing.""


After Shi Ruibin took over as the chairman of the board last year, he added performance bonuses while at the same time drastically reorganizing the department and reducing short-term investments.

Carrots and sticks received results in parallel. In the first half of this year, Emmett's revenue was 6.329 billion yuan, and the gross profit margin hit a new high in 6 years. In order to reduce the performance and suffer from the cold and hot weather, a user research center has also been set up to analyze consumer habits with big data as a basis for product improvement.
In the past, Emmett's product development strategy was “early 2 years reserve”. Shi Ruibin said: ""Card said that Dad said that it would be good to open 2 sets of 10 sets of molds. Now it is really impossible. A set of molds is about NT$10 million. Many things are changing at any time. And platformization, not to guess what consumers want or should like.""
Taking out a circulating fan that was the best-selling in China in the first half of this year by data improvement, Shi Ruibin explained, ""The traditional circulation fan is short, because the head is heavy and the neck will fall again, but we have overcome this problem."" The neck of the circulation fan is stretched and can be swung 180 degrees. Even in a room with heating, the air can be circulated, and the fan can only sell the myth of summer.


After taking over as chairman in June last year, Shi Ruibin took carrots and sticks in parallel. In the first half of this year, Emmett's revenue was 6.329 billion yuan, and the gross profit margin hit a new high in six years.

""In China, you don't have a place to lead the industry. It's really awkward."" Shi Ruibin said that the circulating fan has a unit price of RMB 1,499 (about NT$6,500) and sold RMB 250 million in the first half of the year (about NT$). 1.1 billion yuan). ""Now consumers don't buy cheap things. Many people want quality."" The multi-arrows are seen as the third season of the traditional off-season. This year, it turned into a profit. ""This is only the first year, I want to In the future, Q3 will make money every year.""
