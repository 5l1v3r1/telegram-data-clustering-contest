      <p>Lipa explained that she chose to release ‘Don’t Start Now’ as the first single “so I could close one chapter of my life and start another”.</p>
      <p>“Into a new era with a new sound!” she added. “It’s about moving on and not allowing anyone to get in the way of that. It also felt like a natural first song choice as I made it with the brilliant same crew I made ‘New Rules’ with.”</p>
      <p>‘Don’t Start Now’ previews Lipa’s as-yet-untitled new album, which she says bears a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-new-album-disco-influenced-2546572">“disco influence”</a>.
