【少主反攻番外篇】靠用戶回饋改良產品　他拒當被時代拋棄的傳統產業

「卡早阮爸說，開10套（模具）中2套就好，很像在賭，太主觀了。現在真的不行，你不能去猜消費者喜歡什麼，因為我們一套模具都是新台幣近千萬元的投入。」艾美特電器董事長史瑞斌邊說邊帶著我們，快步地走在深圳總廠內，一塊紅色標語高懸在牆上，寫著：「像造航天飛機般造風扇」。



「我們跟別人相反，夏季做熱的產品，很冷的時候做風扇產品。」史瑞斌解釋，過去艾美特的研發策略是「提早2年做準備」，但現在真的不行，「很多東西隨時在變，要有數據化、平台化，不是去猜消費者想要或應該會喜歡什麼。」


史瑞斌認為，研發產品若不跟上時代，傳統產業很快就會被時代拋棄。

艾美特電器為小家電代工製造商，1997年推出自有品牌「艾美特AIRMATE」，目前是中國風扇與電暖器市場第二大品牌。目前艾美特在中國內外銷比重各半，代工客戶包括日本日立與KOIZUMI、韓國三星、美國Vornado，以及德國Rowenta等，去年創下106億元營收。
「對很多消費者來說，使用塔扇最大的痛點就是不能洗。」拿出一台透過用戶研究中心改良後，可拆下外罩與風扇清的塔扇，史瑞斌指出，「當1百個消費者中，有一半的人告訴我們，塔扇用了半年到冬季要收起來的時候，看到滿滿的灰塵真的很討厭，這讓我們在研發下一代產品的過程中就會去思考，該怎麼解決清洗的問題？」


艾美特位於深圳的總廠設有用戶研究中心，針對消費者回饋體驗改良下一代產品。

指著旁邊一台結合觸控感應的電扇，他又舉例，「像我們在這台風扇的網罩上寫入電子程式，如果小朋友伸手碰到網罩，電扇馬上就會停下來，手才不會捲進去。」「做一個專業品牌，你在中國沒有領先的地方，你真的掰掰了。」史瑞斌說，結合人工智慧與手機聯網，已經成為傳統家電未來發展方向，「你不快點跟上時代，很快就會被時代給拋棄。」

At present, Emmett sells at home and abroad in half, and OEM customers include Japan's Hitachi and KOIZUMI, South Korea's Samsung, US Vornado, and Germany's Rowenta, which generated revenue of 10.6 billion yuan last year.
""For many consumers, the biggest pain point of using a tower fan is that it cannot be washed."" Take out a tower fan that can be removed from the user research center and can be removed from the cover and the fan. Shi Ruibin pointed out, ""When a hundred Half of the consumers told us that when the tower fan was used for six months to the winter, it was really annoying to see the dust, which made us think in the process of developing the next generation of products. How to solve the cleaning problem?""


Emmett's head office in Shenzhen has a user research center that improves the next generation of products for consumer feedback.

Pointing to the side of a fan combined with touch sensing, he also exemplified, ""Like us write electronic programs on the fan's net cover, if the children reach into the net cover, the fan will stop immediately, and the hand will not ""You will be involved in a professional brand. You have no lead in China. You are really embarrassed."" Shi Ruibin said that combining artificial intelligence and mobile phone networking has become the future direction of traditional home appliances. ""You don't hurry.
