【少主反攻3】父立「傳賢不傳子」　他收回兵符毛利創新高

日本是艾美特的重要市場，小家電代工年出貨量達8百萬台。因為曾在日本留學、工作5年，日本客戶通常由能說一口流利日語的史瑞斌親自接待，「老闆出馬，不用翻譯，你跟客戶的關係也會比較親近。」



2002年，史瑞斌返台不久便進入深圳艾美特上班，從總務採購員做起，4年後在台灣的父親卻因罹患肺部腫瘤頻繁進出醫院。「那時我偶爾會從深圳回台，但父親已經算是比較不好了。」為就近照顧父親，史瑞斌回到東富電器擔任董事長特助，但半年後父親便因病過世。
史鴻堯生前仿效高科技公司，開放資深員工配股，並立下了「傳賢不傳子」的經營方針。股份多由史家持有的東富電器，由史瑞斌接任董事長，同時兼任艾美特董事，而當年和史鴻堯合夥的創始人鄭立平與蔡正富，則分別出任艾美特董事長與副董事長一職，另聘請楊裕復出任執行長。


曾在日本留學5年，日本客戶通常由史瑞斌（中）親自接待，以一口流利的日語拉近與客戶間的距離。

在專業經理人帶領下，艾美特代工外銷穩定發展，除日、韓之外，德、法與義市場亦有所突破。直到去年，鄭立平身體微恙，「當初父親的團隊已經年邁了，鄭董問我：『你在台灣過得生活太舒服啦，要回來再學習嗎？』我告訴自己，要做就做到最好，不然不要做。」


史瑞斌接任艾美特董事長後，他給自己的期許是「要做就做到最好，不然不要做」。

史瑞斌接任前，艾美特在代工和自有品牌市場看似穩妥，實際上卻面臨中國市場內銷方式轉變帶來的虧損，及股價持續探底等挑戰。「2013年上市之後，我們股價走得不太順遂。有段時間，甚至有銀行夥伴發出『貴公司未來堪憂』等報告。」史瑞斌苦笑說：「去年下半年，我就是這樣過來的。」他笑著解釋，眉頭卻鎖得更緊。

[Less Master Counterattack 3] The father ""receives the sage and does not pass the child""
04 Nov 2019, 02:54 by Qiu Wanren, Lin Yuwei, Wu Mingwei
Japan is an important market for Emmett, with annual shipments of small appliances reaching 8 million units. Because I have been studying and working in Japan for 5 years, Japanese clients are usually personally greeted by Shi Ruibin, who speaks fluent Japanese. ""The boss is out of the company and you don't need to translate. Your relationship with customers will be closer.""



In 2002, Shi Ruibin entered Shenzhen Emmett to work soon after he returned to Taiwan. He started from the general affairs buyer. Four years later, his father in Taiwan frequently entered and exited the hospital because of lung cancer. ""At that time, I occasionally returned to Shenzhen from Shenzhen, but my father was already quite bad."" In order to take care of his father, Shi Ruibin returned to Dongfu Electric as the special support of the chairman, but his father died of illness after half a year.
Shi Hongjun emulated a high-tech company before his death, opened up senior staff to share shares, and set up a business policy of ""passing the sages and not passing on the child."" Dongfu Electric, which is owned by historians, was replaced by Shi Ruibin as the chairman and concurrently as a director of Emmett. In the same year, Zheng Liping and Cai Zhengfu, the founders of Shi Hongjun, became the chairman and vice chairman of Emmett, respectively. Yang Yufu became the CEO.


After studying in Japan for 5 years, Japanese clients are usually personally received by Shi Ruibin (centre) to draw closer to customers with fluent Japanese.

Under the leadership of professional managers, Emmett's OEM sales have developed steadily. In addition to Japan and Korea, the German, French and Italian markets have also made breakthroughs. Until last year, Zheng Liping was very weak. ""The father's team was old. Zheng Dong asked me: ""You lived in Taiwan too comfortable. Would you like to come back and study again?"" I told myself that I would do the most. Ok, don't do it.""


After Shi Ruibin took over as chairman of Emmett, he gave his expectation that ""do it best, or not.""

Before Shi Ruibin took over, Emmett appeared to be safe in the OEM and private label market. In fact, it faced the challenges of the loss of the domestic market in the Chinese market and the continued bottoming out of the stock price. ""After listing in 2013, our stock price did not go smoothly. Some time, even bank partners issued reports such as ""Your company is worried about the future."" Shi Ruibin said with a smile: ""In the second half of last year, I came here."" Laughing and explaining, the brow is locked tighter.
