      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:35:51+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool ace Sadio Mane has revealed the "secret" to Jurgen Klopp's success at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - being a father figure in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Klopp has transformed the Anfield outfit into Champions League winners and Premier League title contenders since taking the top job in 2015.</p>
      <p>Senegalese striker Mane has been amongst the players to benefit from Klopp's management, being one of a record-breaking seven Liverpool players on the latest Ballon d'Or shortlist.</p>
      <p>In a revealing interview with <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/">France Football</a> , giving a glimpse inside the Anfield dressing room, Mane explained just how Klopp is viewed by his players and why that is vital to his success.</p>
      <p>Mane said: “His secret, I think, is to be the team’s dad. Between us, everything clicked straight away.</p>
      <p>"We all love him like a father and we fear him like one too.</p>
      <p>"He takes up a lot of space in my life, and not just in football. He’s great as a person.</p>
      <p>"I trust him blindly, like most of the dressing room, I think.”</p>

      <p>In the same interview, Mane also insisted his disagreement with Mohamed Salah from earlier this season is behind him, stating it is a "pleasure" to play with the Egyptian.</p>
      <p>“He’s a crazy goalscorer and an exceptional player who can do everything," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have sometimes had our disagreements, but it remains a great pleasure to play besides him because I have the feeling we speak the same type of football.”</p>

      <p>Mane also opened up on the impact of "true friend" Naby Keita in his life on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>He added: “He’s more than a friend for me, he’s a brother.</p>
      <p>"It hasn’t been easy for him lately because he was injured for a long time, but I know he’ll come back at his best, because he’s working hard to do so.</p>
      <p>“He just needs to improve his English to be understood more by everyone, but to be able to count on a true friend in the group, that’s priceless. It’s even calming at times.”</p>
