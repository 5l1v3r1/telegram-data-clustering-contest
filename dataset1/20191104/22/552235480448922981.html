      <h1>Stephen Robinson and Jack Ross lead Hibs boss hunt as Paul Heckingbottom's brutal dismissal laid bare</h1>
      <h2>The Leith club have started their search to replace Paul Heckingbottom after he was sacked on Monday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:29:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs could make a shock move for Motherwell boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> after sacking Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>Robinson – who has led Well to third place in the Premiership – has been recommended to the Easter Road board by Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill.</p>
      <p>Former Sunderland and St Mirren gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> is also on the radar as Robinson has been tipped to take over at Hearts ever since Craig Levein was axed last week.</p>
      <p>But  <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i> understands Hibs chief Leann Dempster is considering hijacking that proposed move after calling time on Heckingbottom’s reign.</p>

      <p>Ross could offer a more straightforward option and it’s believed his right-hand man James Fowler was at Hampden on Saturday to run the rule over Hibees as they crashed out of the Betfred Cup semi-finals with a 5-2 thrashing from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>Ross is currently out of work but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> would have to cough up around £200,000 to get Robinson.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Heckingbottom</a> too will be looking for a hefty payout after having his deal terminated less than one year into the job.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the Englishman was sacked over the phone yesterday afternoon after returning to England.</p>
      <p>A Hibs statement read: “Paul Heckingbottom and his assistant coach Robbie Stockdale have been relieved of their duties.</p>
      <p>“Head of player development Eddie May will take charge of the team on an interim basis – supported by Grant Murray and Steven Whittaker.”</p>
      <p>Motherwell insisted no approaches had been made for Robinson, who has worked with ex-Hibee O’Neill at international level.</p>
      <p>Alan Stubbs, who guided Hibs to their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, admitted he would return to the club. He said: “I’d <br/>be interested. Yeah.”</p>
      <p>Former Easter Road skipper Kevin Thomson could also be a contender along with veteran Bundesliga-winning boss Felix Magath and one-time Hibees hitman Shefki Kuqi.</p>
