【淘寶大軍壓境3】好大的手筆　淘寶台灣一登台就擺出百人團隊陣仗
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 林育緯
中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下的電商平台淘寶，今年在台灣以嶄新面貌重新出擊，授權台灣業者代理經營，正式宣告合法落地。在「淘寶台灣」10月正式上線前，便馬不停蹄地招兵買馬，目前團隊約百人，近半數都是招商業務高手。



「『淘寶台灣』是淘寶真正落地台灣的開始，只有你想不到的，沒有你淘不到的！」上月23日，在北市華山文創園區「淘寶台灣」上線記者會，出身台灣、阿里巴巴集團首席市場官的董本洪，褪去畢挺西裝，身穿白襯衫配牛仔褲，腳踩黑色帆布鞋，一身年輕勁裝如同「淘寶台灣」嶄新面貌，一臉雀躍的宣布透過授權克雷達成立淘寶台灣，正式合法落地。
淘寶台灣辦公室位在北市南京復興站商圈的商辦大樓，大手筆租下兩層樓面，每層佔地約300坪，內部還在如火如荼的裝修中，目前團隊約100人，半數以上都是隸屬招商團隊的業務高手，不少是來自蝦皮、PChome、Yahoo等一線電商，未來將會持續大規模擴編。「做生意就是要文武百市匯集，電商尤其如此。」淘寶授權代理商英商克雷達行銷長林雅雯說。
上週五（1日），林雅雯急著說清楚、講明白，顧不得新辦公室還在整修，接受本刊獨家專訪，「淘寶對於台灣消費者很熟悉，但好感度還不夠，我們要強化本地化服務，包括便捷的退貨機制、多元付款方式等。」林雅雯補充，「請把全新的『淘寶台灣』和現有的『手機淘寶』當做兩家不同的公司，而『淘寶台灣』是由台灣團隊經營。」
林雅雯坦言，「我們是一個多元化的平台，有公司貨、也有俗稱的水貨，提供消費者多元選擇，同樣的商品價格的確會比現有的『手機淘寶』略高，因為需要支應在地化營運成本。」
被委以重任的行銷長林雅雯，資歷相當顯赫，9月才加入淘寶台灣團隊，6年級生的她，待過NOKIA等國際大公司，擁有12年電信業背景、5年電商資歷，也曾創業2年做數位廣告，來到淘寶台灣前，是台灣大哥大myfone行動商務處處長，首創門號綁家電的創新發起者，也將電商平台成功轉化為門市虛擬貨架，有效刺激業績，具備線上、線下整合的新零售長才，更是被淘寶相中延攬的主要原因。
為了要讓台灣消費者從原先的「手機淘寶」，願意轉向本土化的「淘寶台灣」平台消費，首先便豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了鋪天蓋地的包下捷運站、公車等鬧區戶內外廣告，吸住眾人目光外，最能打動消費者的，就是在平台上推出超狂折扣，雙11期間超過千萬項商品祭出零元免運費，還有1元清空價值百萬元的購物車等優惠活動。

Before the ""Taobao Taiwan"" was officially launched in October, it was recruited without stopping. At present, the team is about 100 people, and nearly half of them are experts in investment promotion.



""Taobao Taiwan is the beginning of Taobao's real landing in Taiwan. Only you can't think of it, you can't find it!"" On the 23rd of last month, at the ""Taobao Taiwan"" press conference in Huashan Wenchuang Park, North City, I was born in Taiwan. Dong Benhong, the chief marketing officer of Alibaba Group, has lost his suit, wearing a white shirt with jeans, black canvas shoes, and a young face like ""Taobao Taiwan"", with a new look, through the authorization of Kedar Established Taobao Taiwan, officially and legally.
The Taobao Taiwan office is located in the commercial office building of the Nanjing Fuxing Station business district in the north city. It rents two floors and each floor covers an area of about 300 pings. The interior is still in full swing. At present, the team is about 100 people, more than half of them. It is a business expert affiliated to the investment promotion team. Many of them are from the first-line e-commerce companies such as Shrimp Skin, PChome, and Yahoo. They will continue to expand on a large scale in the future. ""To do business is to bring together the civil and military cities, especially for e-commerce."" Taobao authorized agent Yingke Kerada marketing director Lin Yawen said.
Last Friday (1st), Lin Yawen rushed to make it clear and understand, and refused to accept the new office is still undergoing renovation. I received an exclusive interview with the magazine. ""Taobao is very familiar with Taiwanese consumers, but the degree of goodwill is not enough. We must strengthen it. Localization services, including convenient return mechanism, multiple payment methods, etc.. Lin Yawen added, ""Please treat the new ""Taobao Taiwan"" and the existing ""Mobile Taobao"" as two different companies, and ""Taobao Taiwan"" It is operated by the Taiwan team.""
Lin Yawen said frankly, ""We are a diversified platform, there are corporate goods, also known as parallel imports, providing consumers with multiple choices.

Lin Yawen, who is entrusted with the heavy responsibility of marketing, has considerable qualifications. She joined the Taobao Taiwan team in September. She is a 6th grade student. She has been a major international company such as NOKIA. She has 12 years of telecom background and 5 years of e-commerce qualification. I have been doing business for 2 years to make digital advertisements. Before I came to Taobao Taiwan, I was the head of the Myfone Mobile Business Division of Taiwan’s Big Brother, the initiator of the innovation of the first door-to-door appliance, and also successfully transformed the e-commerce platform into a virtual shelf of the store, effectively stimulating. The performance, the new retail talents with online and offline integration, is the main reason for being recruited by Taobao.
In order to let Taiwanese consumers move from the original ""Mobile Taobao"" to the localized ""Taobao Taiwan"" platform consumption, they will first be eager to make a billion-dollar marketing campaign, in addition to the overwhelming package of the MRT station and bus. Waiting for indoor and outdoor advertisements in the downtown area, attracting everyone's attention, the most impressing consumers is to launch a super-freak discount on the platform. During the double 11 period, more than 10 million items will be offered free shipping, and 1 yuan will be cleared. A million-dollar shopping cart and other special offers.
