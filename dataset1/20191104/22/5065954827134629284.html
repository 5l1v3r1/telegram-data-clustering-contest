      <p>MALACAÑANG on Monday said its filing of a new diplomatic protest against China for its alleged harassment of a foreign ship in Philippine waters will threaten the employment of thousands of Filipino seafarers abroad.</p>
      <p>“We will be putting at risk the employment of more than 400,000 deployed Filipino seafarers and mariners, by sending a message to shipping companies of our country’s inclination to meddle with or interfere into their own maritime affairs for the sole reason that a Filipino is under their employ,” Presidential spokesperson Salvador S. Panelo said in a statement. </p>
      <p>Panelo reiterated his previous position that the Sept. 30 incident involving the ship “Green Aura,” which is Liberian-flagged and Greek-owned, is not a Philippine matter. </p>
      <p>It just happened, he noted, that the captain of the vessel was a Filipino. </p>
      <p>“We cannot deprive the country being represented by the oil tanker of its right and duty to protect its own ship,” Panelo said.  </p>
      <p>“To do otherwise, will be effectively divesting such country of its right and competence to take up the cudgels for its ship. Such a demeanor will be a disrespect to it and even insulting to the capability of that country to assert its right,” he explained.   </p>
      <p>Panelo issued the statement after local maritime law expert Jay Batongbacal criticized the administration’s inaction over the incident.  </p>
      <p>Batongbacal argued the government’s silence over the matter will effectively legitimize China’s claim over the disputed territory.</p>
      <p>Panelo dismissed Batongbacal’s assertions for “ignoring the dynamics of the issues on the ground.” </p>
      <p>He further said the administration continues to oppose China’s claims in the West Philippine Sea.  </p>
      <p>“We are currently in that process and it is moving forward and well. Such a process does not comprise a Filipino seaman engaging in a word war with an agent of China,” Panelo said.</p>
