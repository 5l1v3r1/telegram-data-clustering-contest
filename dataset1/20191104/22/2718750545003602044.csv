Fantastic Beasts Takes ‘Come to Brazil!’ Twitter Literally, Sets Third Film in Rio
04 Nov 2019, 22:45 by Devon Ivie
Accio, Grindelwald and all of his pretty-boy crimes. A year after the most recent Fantastic Beasts film flirted with Dumbledore’s sexuality and made a whole lot of money, Warner Bros. confirmed a third film in the Potter-adjacent franchise, tentatively titled Fantastic Beasts 3, will begin production in spring 2020. Per Deadline, the drama will move away from France in favor of exploring the wizarding culture of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Terry Gilliam is shaking!), with the entire cast returning and presumably bonding over some cachaça: Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Katherine Waterston, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, and Dan Fogler. Additionally, Jessica Williams’s role as Professor Eulalie “Lally” Hicks has expanded and will become more prominent. As with the previous two Fantastic Beasts films, J.K. Rowling is confirmed to write the script, and the chances of dancing on the sand have now doubled.
