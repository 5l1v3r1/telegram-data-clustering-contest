      <h1>Uber's quarterly loss widens as costs rise; shares fall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T01:03:56+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">Tina Bellon, Akanksha Rana</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/UBER.N">UBER.N</a>) on Monday posted a wider third-quarter loss as the company tries to outspend competitors through discounts and invests heavily in loss-making new business ventures, sending its shares down 5.5% in after-hours trading.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, the company promised it would be profitable by the end of 2021 as quarterly revenues, driven by its global ride-hailing business, beat expectations.</p>
      <p>Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told journalists on a conference call the company as a whole would achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year of 2021, but declined to provide details on the performance of individual business units by that time.</p>
      <p>The move follows a similar announcement by smaller ride-hailing competitor Lyft Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/LYFT.O">LYFT.O</a>) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Uber’s costs jumped about 33% to $4.92 billion in the latest quarter. Gross bookings, which include ride-hailing, mobility, food delivery and freight payments, rose 29% from a year earlier to $16.47 billion.</p>
      <p>Overall, the company’s net loss widened to $1.16 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $986 million a year earlier, while net loss on a per-share basis narrowed to 68 cents from $2.21.</p>
      <p>“Uber would be EBITDA positive if it wasn’t also investing in Uber Eats, the freight operation and autonomous driving capabilities,” said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.</p>

      <p>Known for its ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities worldwide, Uber has vastly diversified its business over the past years.</p>
      <p>The company is building out its long-haul trucking and food delivery business Uber Eats, developing self-driving cars, offering banking services to its drivers and even planning commercial passenger drone shuttles by 2023.</p>
      <p>It collected total third-quarter revenues of $3.81 billion, up nearly 30% year over year, beating estimates of $3.69 billion.</p>
      <p>But Uber is facing regulatory challenges to its business model and shareholders so far appear unimpressed by the company’s push to diversify.</p>
      <p>Its shares have lost some 30% since going public in May as investors lose patience with venture capital-fueled startups offering only murky paths to profitability.</p>
      <p>They stood at $29.36 in Monday after-hours trading.</p>
      <p>Shares are expected to be squeezed further on Wednesday, when a restriction on selling stock lifts. Some analysts expect more than 80% of the company’s outstanding shares will become eligible for sale.</p>
      <p>With Uber under pressure, investors are keen to see the company expanding market share.</p>
      <p>Uber’s monthly active users across rides, bike shares and food delivery rose to 103 million globally in the third quarter, from 82 million a year earlier. But they fell short of analysts’ estimates of 105.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Monday’s results also heightened the differences between Uber and Lyft, which only operates in the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p>Lyft executives on Wednesday, in an apparent dig at Uber’s sprawling business ventures, emphasized they remained squarely focused on mobility.</p>
      <p>Revenue from Uber’s ride-hailing business rose about 19% to $2.90 billion and contributed $631 million to third-quarter earnings.</p>
      <p>Sales from Uber Eats, the company’s fastest-growing unit, rose 64%, but nearly 40% of revenues were spent on incentive and referral payments, as Uber tries to gain market share.</p>
      <p>“At least over the next couple of quarters we still see a lot of money flowing into (Eats),” Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said during a Monday analyst call.</p>
      <p>Uber hopes its ride-hailing business will come in handy, allowing the company to undercut competitors’ delivery costs by having drivers ferry around pizzas instead of passengers when demand is low.</p>
      <p>In doing so, Uber, like other “gig economy” businesses, is largely relying on freelance contractors.</p>
      <p>A new California law, set to go into effect on Jan. 1, would turn most of the state’s roughly 450,000 gig workers into full-time employees and has garnered nationwide attention.</p>

      <p>Uber, Lyft and food delivery company DoorDash have pushed for separate legislation that would increase pay and benefits for drivers yet maintain their status as independent contractors.</p>
      <p>Khosrowshahi on Monday said he was hoping U.S. politicians would be willing to work with the industry.</p>
      <p>“But if not, we’ll continue to aggressively defend our drivers’ right to flexibility,” the CEO said.</p>
