      <h1>West Brom return to Championship summit with easy win over Stoke</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:21:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/PA%20Media" target="_blank">PA Media</a></address>
      <p>Matt Phillips and Hal Robson-Kanu fired West Brom back to the top of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/leeds-kiko-casilla-charged-racist-language">Championship</a> as Stoke remain rooted to the bottom after a disappointing 2-0 defeat.</p>
      <p>The midfielder Phillips’ sixth goal of the season gave the Baggies a sixth-minute lead and Robson-Kanu’s second-half penalty ensured they comfortably avoided an upset at the Bet365 Stadium and leapfrogged Preston at the summit.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international Phillips was never going to miss from close range for his second goal in successive games as Slaven Bilic’s side stretched their unbeaten run to five matches.</p>
      <p>And Robson-Kanu’s third goal in four matches inflicted an 11th defeat in 15 games on Stoke who, only three days ago, sacked their manager, Nathan Jones, after a miserable start to the season. They are now six points adrift of safety.</p>
      <p>The defender Cameron Carter-Vickers fouled winger Grady Diangana and Robson-Kanu, on as a substitute, coolly scored from the spot. Victory puts the Baggies two points ahead of Preston, Leeds and Swansea.</p>
      <p>Stoke’s teenage striker Tyrese Campbell forced an early save from Sam Johnstone but his left-foot shot was easy for the West Brom keeper. Two minutes later the visitors took the lead.</p>
      <p>Diangana, on loan from West Ham, worked a clever one-two with Jake Livermore and delivered across the face of goal where the unmarked Phillips easily slotted home.</p>
      <p>At the other end Stoke broke on the counterattack and Sam Vokes headed Tommy Smith’s cross straight at Johnstone. Darnell Furlong tried his luck from distance in reply but his right-foot shot flew well wide before West Brom’s Charlie Austin suffered a bloodied nose when hit by a stray arm from Liam Lindsay just before half-time.</p>
      <p>Carter-Vickers should have levelled straight after the break but the right-back somehow shot over from point-blank range. Danny Batth headed Sam Clucas’s corner perfectly into his path at the back post but he rushed his effort and it flew well over.</p>
      <p>But no matter how hard they tried Stoke struggled to create clear-cut opportunities for their frustrated fans. Carter-Vickers’ reckless challenge on Diangana resulted in West Brom’s penalty – and Robson-Kanu made no mistake to seal the points.</p>
      <p>The Welshman had been on the pitch for only six minutes but he calmly slotted into the bottom left corner as Jack Butland dived the opposite way.</p>
      <p>It should have been 3-0 moments later but this time Robson-Kanu headed Phillips’ inch-perfect cross against the right post. Robson-Kanu also forced a save out of Butland at the end as West Brom deservedly picked up maximum points.</p>
