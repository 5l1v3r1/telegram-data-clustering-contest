04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 林育緯
隨著雙11購物節倒數計時，中國大陸電商龍頭、阿里巴巴旗下的電商平台淘寶，今年在台灣以嶄新面貌重新出擊，授權台灣業者代理經營，正式宣告合法落地。本刊調查，適逢雙11購物節，「淘寶台灣」豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了大打廣告、祭出千萬項商品免運費，更推出超狂「1元清空百萬購物車」活動，讓本土電商剉咧等。經營型態與淘寶相似的蝦皮購物、PChome商店街首當其衝，三強激戰一觸即發。



「『淘寶台灣』是淘寶真正落地台灣的開始，只有你想不到的，沒有你淘不到的！」上月23日，在北市華山文創園區「淘寶台灣」上線記者會，出身台灣、阿里巴巴集團首席市場官的董本洪，褪去畢挺西裝，身穿白襯衫配牛仔褲，腳踩黑色帆布鞋，一身年輕勁裝如同「淘寶台灣」嶄新面貌，一臉雀躍的宣布透過授權「克雷達」成立淘寶台灣，正式合法落地。
本刊調查，淘寶過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，依循蝦皮購物模式，由台灣業者取得品牌授權代理經營，以「淘寶台灣」名號捲土重來，名正言順的正式落地，強勢殺入電商市場，提供繁體中文化介面、7天鑑賞期、本地退貨，以及更為安心的超商取貨付款，把過去淘寶令人詬病的痛點一一改善，準備全力進攻台灣市場。
記者實際操作「淘寶台灣」全新平台發現，無疑地蛻變成道地的台灣電商，操作介面跟目前蝦皮、PChome等相似，可望吸引到以往搞不懂集貨及直送差異的消費者。
為了要讓台灣消費者從原先的「手機淘寶」，願意轉向本土化的「淘寶台灣」平台消費，首先便豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了鋪天蓋地的包下捷運站、公車等鬧區戶內外廣告，吸住眾人目光外，最能打動消費者的，就是在平台上推出超狂折扣，雙11期間超過千萬項商品祭出零元免運費，還有1元清空價值百萬元的購物車等優惠活動。
未料經營模式相似的淘寶台灣再度祭出重招，對於蝦皮購物、PChome商店街來說噩夢是否重演，外界也相當好奇。momo董事長林啟峰日前接受媒體訪問時語重心長地表示，「『淘寶台灣』經營模式，跟蝦皮、PChome商店街比較類似，接下來勢必有一番激戰，對於momo我覺得初期影響還看不出來。」
面對淘寶台灣強勢來襲，PChome商店街和蝦皮購物也進入備戰狀態，雙十一大戰正式開打。擁有700萬會員、12萬店家的PChome商店街同樣祭出免運費，玩小遊戲或是消費可獲得等同購物金的貓糧，一個貓糧等同1元，雙11當天可全額折抵，預計灑出上億元。另外，蝦皮購物則是預計砸千萬元預算促銷，祭出滿額免運外，將於本週四公布當天黑最殺折扣品等更多優惠。
挾著阿里巴巴的龐大資源，淘寶台灣這回豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，就是要在雙11年度電商大檔，一舉攻城掠地，而面對攻勢凌厲的電商巨擘來襲，本土電商要怎麼接招，外界都在看。
