【黑獄私刑奪命2】逼簽「無異議」切結書　家屬控獄方掩蓋私刑真相
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 莊琇閔
高雄監獄10月中爆發陳姓受刑人意外噎死案，法醫解剖後發現，死者不僅臉部有外傷，肋骨也斷裂，疑似生前遭人毆打致死。檢方深入偵辦後認定，與死者同房的4名重刑犯涉有重嫌，另外2名管理員有疏失，依傷害致死罪將6人聲請羈押獲准。
陳瑞卿的姊姊接受本刊訪問時表示，解剖前雄監就拿來一張對死因無異議的切結書，要求家屬簽名，但家屬認為根本還沒解剖，也不知道結果，因此拒簽。解剖一結束，獄方又再次要求陳家簽切結書，仍遭家屬拒絕。


陳瑞卿疑似在違規房與獄友肢體衝突，晚餐後不久，突然倒地嘔吐、送醫不治。圖為示意圖。

解剖後家屬領回遺體，隔天準備辦理火化，這時家人才得知，陳不僅臉上有外傷，肋骨也斷裂。家屬想起獄方對陳的死亡情形未交代清楚，又急著要家屬簽署切結書，明顯不合常理。

另外，陳瑞卿的四姊也想起，被通知到醫院時，弟弟穿著長袖長褲的囚衣，但平時他在舍房穿的是白色短袖Ｔ恤和藍短褲，如果像獄方當時所說，弟弟已經躺在地上，如何能自己更衣？更不解弟弟平時身強體壯，沒有特殊病史，還可在工地裡做粗活，怎麼會突然暴斃？種種不合常理的狀況，讓家屬質疑雄監刻意隱瞞真相。

[Black prison lynching death 2] forced to sign ""no objection"" cut-off book family prisoner to cover up the truth of lynching
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Zhuang Wei
Kaohsiung Prison broke out in October in the case of Chen’s accidental death. After the forensic anatomy, the deceased not only had facial injuries, but also ribs. He was suspected of being beaten to death. After the prosecution conducted in-depth investigation, it was determined that the four heavy criminals in the same room as the deceased were suspected of being seriously suspected, and the other two administrators were negligent. Six people were required to be detained for death according to the crime of injury.
Chen Ruiqing’s visit to the journal said that before the dissection, the male supervisor took a cut-off book that had no objection to the cause of death and asked the family to sign it. However, the family members believed that they had not dissected at all and did not know the result, so they refused to sign. At the end of the anatomy, the prison authorities again asked Chen to sign the cut-off book, which was still rejected by the family.


Chen Ruiqing suspected that he had a physical conflict with the prisoner in the illegal house. Shortly after dinner, he suddenly fell vomiting and died. The picture is a schematic diagram.

After dissection, the family took back the body and prepared for cremation the next day. At this time, the family learned that Chen not only had a trauma on his face, but also broken ribs. The family thinks that the prisoner’s death of Chen’s death has not been clearly explained, and he is anxious to ask his family to sign the cut-off book, which is obviously unreasonable.


Kaohsiung Prison often holds lectures to let prisoners know about legal information. (provided by Kaohsiung Prison)

In addition, Chen Ruiqing’s four sisters also remembered that when he was notified to the hospital, his younger brother wore a long-sleeved trousers, but he usually wore a white short-sleeved T-shirt and blue shorts in the house, if the prisoner said at the time, the younger brother Already lying on the ground, how can I change my clothes? I am even more puzzled that my younger brother is physically strong and strong, has no special medical history, and can do rough work on the construction site. How can it suddenly become violent? All kinds of unreasonable conditions, let the family suspect that the male prisoner deliberately concealed the truth.
