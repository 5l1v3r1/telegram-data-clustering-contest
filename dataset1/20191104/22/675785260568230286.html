      <h1>David Busst opens up on career-ending injury after Andre Gomes incident</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Former Coventry defender Busst's career was ended during a match against Manchester United in 1996</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>As players held their heads in their hands over Andre Gomes’ horror injury, the scenes at Goodison Park brought back bad memories for David Busst.</p>
      <p>It was at Old Trafford on April 8, 1996, when Coventry defender Busst suffered an appalling broken leg, which punctured his skin, shed blood on the pitch and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rushed away to vomit.</p>
      <p>Rarely a day goes by without Busst thinking about it. He was caught between challenges from United’s Brian McClair and Denis Irwin at a corner.</p>
      <p>Now 52, Busst underwent 10 operations in his first 12 days of a six-week spell in hospital.</p>
      <p>He eventually had 23 operations, with his nightmare compounded by an MRSA infection which left him with a right leg he says now resembles “a shark bite”. He never played again.</p>

      <p>Busst now works for the Sky Blues In The Community charity and hopes advances in surgery will ensure a better recovery for Gomes.</p>
      <p>“For the first few days he will have questions like, ‘Will I play again, what is the extent of the injury and when can I start training again’?,” said Busst.</p>
      <p>“It is all those questions and no-one will be able to give exact answers.</p>
      <p>“He will be reflecting on the injury and you have those questions of self-doubt. But no two injuries are the same and for me it is whether the injury stayed in the skin or came out.</p>
      <p>“But technology has moved on from 23 years ago when my injury was at the forefront.</p>

      <p>“Also, nowadays when you sign a contract you probably don’t need to ever work again. All the players are heavily insured and all the financial concerns I went through won’t apply.</p>
      <p>“It will be about the physical and mental side of getting through this. But all footballers are generally mentally resilient because they have to be to get into the profession.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it was a clean break – with mine it was a spiral fracture which is one of the worst you can have.</p>
      <p>“But I have always had a clear outlook on life. S*** happens and you get on with it. It is setting small achievable goals and moving forwards.”</p>

      <p>Gomes’ injury left the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> star screaming in agony and Heung-Min Son was in tears long after the final whistle after getting sent off by VAR for a foul in the incident.</p>
      <p>Busst believes the ordeal will continue to affect everyone who witnessed it, even the spectators.</p>
      <p>He added: “I meet old Coventry team-mates at former player events and they tell me their perspective.</p>
      <p>“Everyone saw it from different angles. I also get fans telling me they were at that game and can recall Schmeichel being sick.</p>
      <p>“I’ve not spoken to Denis or Brian about the injury. But ultimately we all respect our fellow professionals.</p>
      <p>“Son will wonder if he have done anything else, was it a freak accident?</p>
      <p>“The worst injuries are cruciates and leg breaks. But before they used to be career-threatening and now it is not as bad with technology moving on.”</p>
