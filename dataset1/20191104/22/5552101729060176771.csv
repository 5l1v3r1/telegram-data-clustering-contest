【綠直搗韓營2】教訓「落跑市長」　綠委喊高雄得票破百萬
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 黃揚明, 林育緯
綠營布局總統蔡英文連任節奏明確，16日蔡英文高雄競總率先插旗，地點就設在鳳山市議會旁，目前正緊鑼密鼓施工。



綠營基層對去年高雄市長一役慘敗，至今耿耿於懷。10月16日，高雄民進黨立委趙天麟接受蔡英文競辦《一起吃早餐》網路節目專訪時公開喊話，希望選民唾棄「落跑市長」韓國瑜，讓蔡英文打破2014年陳菊連任市長的99萬票紀錄，一舉衝破百萬票。
但趙天麟的說法令綠營黨公職憂心太過輕敵，加上近期黨內都在營造支持者危機意識，因此趙已不再提起高雄衝百萬票的論述。

蔡英文高雄競總也是陳菊2014年連任成功的競總所在地，綠營基層已下達動員令，黨籍立委、議員、里長各有動員責任額，預計當天將集結超過3萬人，展現勝選氣勢。
黨內人士透露，蔡英文競辦認為選情穩定領先，不急於舉辦大型造勢刺激韓粉，畢竟和韓粉拚場不一定有優勢，也避免在選舉激戰時讓綠營支持者動員疲乏，因此六都競總成立都將舉辦結合在地特產、美食的親子園遊會，希望除了傳統造勢演講場，也能吸引更多都會區中間選民參與，藉以炒熱立委選情。
蔡英文競辦發言人阮昭雄說，高雄總部率先成立純粹是總統行程安排上的巧合，內部討論時確實有人認為可能讓外界誤會是針對韓國瑜，但蔡英文是現任總統，不會只做選舉鋪陳，也沒有從哪個縣市出發的問題。

The green camp layout president Tsai Ing-wen has a clear rhythm. On the 16th, Tsai Ing-wen Kaohsiung was the first to insert a flag. The location is located next to the Fengshan City Council and is currently under construction.



At the grassroots level of the Green Camp, the mayor of Kaohsiung last year was defeated. On October 16, Zhao Tianlin, the legislator of the Kaohsiung Democratic Progressive Party, accepted a public speech when he was interviewed by Tsai Ing-wen for the ""Drinking Breakfast Together"" online program. He hoped that the voters would cast aside the ""mayor of the run"", and let Cai Ying break the re-election of Chen Ju in 2014. The mayor’s record of 990,000 votes broke through millions of votes in one fell swoop.
However, Zhao Tianlin’s statement made the Green Camp’s public service worry too much, and the recent party’s awareness of crisis support was created. Therefore, Zhao has no longer mentioned the Kaohsiung’s tens of millions of votes.


Zhao Tianlin hopes that the voters will cast aside on the ""falling mayor"" of South Korea.

According to sources inside the party, Tsai Ing-wen believes that the election is stable and leading, and is not eager to hold a large-scale spurt to stimulate Korean powder. After all, it is not necessarily advantageous to compete with Korean powder, and to avoid the green camp supporters mobilizing fatigue during the election campaign. The establishment of the Metropolitan Government will hold a parent-child park tour that combines local specialties and food. It is hoped that in addition to the traditional gestures, it will also attract more voters from the middle of the metropolitan area to participate in the election.
Tsai Zhaoxiong, a spokesperson for Tsai Ing-wen, said that the Kaohsiung headquarters took the lead in setting up a mere coincidence on the president’s itinerary. During the internal discussions, some people thought that it might be misunderstood to target South Korea’s Yu, but Tsai Ing-wen is the current president and will not only do elections. There is no question of which county or city to leave.


Tsai Ing-wen Kaohsiung City Competition is located next to the Kaohsiung City Council in Fengshan. The overall building is still under construction.
