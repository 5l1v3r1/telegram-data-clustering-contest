【加州大火】加州不宜人居？ 野火燒出的居住危機
04 Nov 2019, 22:41 by 謝樹寬
美國加州常讓人聯想到陽光，海灘，自由美好。不過近日嚴重的大火造成20萬人被疏散，上百萬戶預防性停電，美國媒體開始討論，是否加州已變得不宜居住。
《大西洋期刊》的評論認為，森林野火以及缺乏可負擔的住宅是加州目前面臨的兩大問題。而且二者還會彼此影響形成惡性循環。
美國加州大火延燒數萬英畝的地區，造成大範圍地區停電，幾十萬居民被迫撤離，包括知名人物前加州州長阿諾史瓦辛格和NBA天王詹姆士的住家都受波及。
另一方面，加州大約有13萬露宿的遊民，還有數以百萬計的民眾因為難以負擔的房租而搬離大都市，改從遙遠的郊區通勤到昂貴的城市工作。
森林野火和負擔不起的高房價，這是加州目前面臨最明顯可見也最迫切的危機。
野火＋高房價　加州居大不易
氣候變遷讓森林野火的發生更加頻繁，而生活成本的飆高連收入優渥的家庭有時也要捉襟見肘。而這兩個問題彼此互相牽動，市中心的高房價把住家推向了更廉價、離都市更邊陲的地區，而這些地區面臨野火的風險也更大。
《大西洋期刊》指出，加州的住房危機和大火危機往往是發生在野地與城市的交界處，即一般所謂的WUI（wildland-urban interface）。在這些區域裡，拖車改造的流動式住家和小木屋就沿著灌木林、松林、和草原間不斷延展。從1990年到2010年之間，加州大約有一半新建的住家是位在這種WUI地帶，它的面積大約擴增了1000平方英里。
「WUI」地區火災高風險
也因此，根據一項保險政策與研究中心（Center for Insurance Policy and Research）所做的估計，加州有200萬個住家，也就是7個住宅裡就有1個是位在野火的高度或極度風險地區，風險程度是美國其他任何一州的3倍以上。
這次加州大規模的野火也是發生在WUI地區。金凱德（Kincade）的大火燒毀了75000英畝的土地，相當於五個紐約曼哈頓。去年造成85人喪生的加州營溪大火，是加州史上最致命的大火，當時上萬戶住家撤離的天堂鎮（Paradise）也是位在WUI區。再前一年，造成22人罹難的塔布斯（Tubbs）野火，超過5000棟建築被摧毀，地點也是在聖塔羅莎和它周邊的WUI地區。
以天然環境來說，野地與城市交界地本來就容易受火災侵襲，不過人類行為仍是主要的罪魁禍首。研究發現，在WUI地區乾枯的樹木枝葉固然是天然的火種，不過建築物、汽車、電線桿、穀倉往往是最有力的燃料。房屋燃燒時溫度往往比樹叢溫度更高，而液態瓦斯則遠比草地更加易燃。
高房價與火災頻繁的惡性循環
既然在WUI的建築如此危險，為什麼要在這裡蓋房子？有部分原因是現有的法令規範，讓加州許多都市地區新建住宅非常困難。在洛杉磯和舊金山露宿街頭的人數眾多也和當地的高房租有關，而城市住宅短缺也迫使人們朝更邊陲的地區發展。而每一次重大的火災發生，不管是否發生在WUI地區，都讓加州的住宅問題更加嚴重。
要解決這兩個問題的一個辦法是在都市地區更密集的興建住宅。大興土木或許可讓房租降低，並把人口移往較少發生火災的地區，同時還有助於減少碳排放。加州州長紐森已經簽署了興建住宅和控制房價的系列措施。不過目前看來，加州距離滿足住屋需求的目標還很遠。而且，氣候還會越來越熱。

[California Blaze] California is not suitable for human habitation? Wildfire burned out of the crisis
04 Nov 2019, 22:41 by Xie Shukuan
California is often reminiscent of the sun, the beach, and freedom. However, the recent severe fire caused 200,000 people to be evacuated, and millions of households had preventive blackouts. The US media began to discuss whether California has become uninhabitable.
The Atlantic Journal commented that forest wildfires and the lack of affordable housing are two of the biggest problems facing California. And the two will also influence each other to form a vicious circle.
The California fires burned tens of thousands of acres, causing power outages in a wide range of areas, and hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, including the well-known former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and NBA King James's home.
On the other hand, there are about 130,000 sleepers in California, and millions of people move out of the metropolis because of unaffordable rents, commuting from distant suburbs to expensive city jobs.
Forest wildfires and unaffordable high housing prices are the most visible and most pressing crisis in California.
Wildfire + high prices
Climate change has made forest wildfires more frequent, and the cost of living is so high that even families with good incomes are sometimes stretched. These two issues are mutually influential, and high housing prices in the city centre have pushed homes to cheaper, more urban-rich areas, and these areas are at greater risk of wildfires.
The Atlantic Journal pointed out that California's housing crisis and fire crisis often occur at the junction of the wild and the city, the so-called WUI (wildland-urban interface). In these areas, trailer-retrofitted mobile homes and cabins continue to stretch along shrubs, pine forests, and grasslands. Between 1990 and 2010, about half of California's new homes were located in this WUI area, and its area was enlarged by about 1,000 square miles.
High risk of fire in the ""WUI"" area
As a result, according to estimates by the Center for Insurance Policy and Research, there are 2 million homes in California, that is, one in seven homes is at the height or extreme risk of wildfires. The degree of risk is more than three times that of any other state in the United States.
This large-scale wildfire in California also occurred in the WUI area. The fire at Kincade burned 75,000 acres of land, equivalent to five New York Manhattans. The California Campfire, which killed 85 people last year, was the deadliest fire in California's history. The Paradise, where tens of thousands of homes were evacuated, was also in the WUI area. The previous year, the Tubbs wildfire, which killed 22 people, destroyed more than 5,000 buildings in the Santa Rosa and its surrounding WUI area.
In the natural environment, the wilderness and the city boundary are inherently vulnerable to fire, but human behavior is still the main culprit. Studies have found that trees and leaves that are dry in the WUI area are natural fires, but buildings, cars, utility poles, and barns are often the most powerful fuels. Houses burn more often than trees, while liquid gas is much more flammable than grass.
High price and frequent vicious circle of fire
Since the building in WUI is so dangerous, why build a house here? Part of the reason is that existing laws and regulations make it difficult to build new homes in many urban areas of California. The large number of people sleeping in the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco is also related to the local high rents, and the shortage of urban housing also forces people to move toward more border areas. And every major fire, whether it happens in the WUI area, makes California's housing problem even worse.
One way to solve these two problems is to build more densely populated homes in urban areas. Large-scale construction or permits to reduce rents and move the population to areas with less fire, while also helping to reduce carbon emissions. California Governor Newson has signed a series of measures to build homes and control home prices. However, it seems that California is still far from meeting the demand for housing. Moreover, the climate will get hotter and hotter.
