【淘寶大軍壓境6】大打補貼戰兩敗俱傷　蝦皮、網家惡夢恐再重演
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 鄒保祥
隨著雙11購物節倒數計時，中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下的電商平台淘寶，今年在台灣以嶄新面貌重新出擊，授權台灣業者代理經營，正式宣告合法落地，適逢雙11購物節，「淘寶台灣」豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了大打廣告、祭出千萬項商品免運費，更推出超狂「1元清空百萬購物車」活動，經營型態與淘寶相似的蝦皮購物、PChome商店街首當其衝，三強激戰一觸即發。
為了要讓台灣消費者從原先的「手機淘寶」，願意轉向本土化的「淘寶台灣」平台消費，淘寶首先便豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了鋪天蓋地的包下捷運站、公車等鬧區戶內外廣告，吸住眾人目光外，最能打動消費者的，就是在平台上推出超狂折扣，雙11期間超過千萬項商品祭出零元免運費，還有1元清空價值百萬元的購物車等優惠活動。
其實台灣消費者早已嘗過免運費甜頭，時間往前拉到2015年，來自新加坡的蝦皮購物，祭出免運補貼戰，一舉打亂電商圈節奏，2017年，首當其衝的PChome商店街，董事長詹宏志下令正面迎戰，但最終遍體鱗傷大虧四個股本並黯然下櫃，而蝦皮自己也不好過，總計虧損超過40億元，可說是兩敗俱傷。
未料經營模式相似的淘寶台灣再度祭出重招，對於蝦皮購物、PChome商店街來說噩夢是否重演，外界也相當好奇。momo董事長林啟峰日前接受媒體訪問時語重心長地表示，「『淘寶台灣』經營模式，跟蝦皮、PChome商店街比較類似，接下來勢必有一番激戰，對於momo我覺得初期影響還看不出來。」
面對淘寶台灣強勢來襲，PChome商店街和蝦皮購物也進入備戰狀態，雙11大戰正式開打。擁有700萬會員、12萬店家的PChome商店街同樣祭出免運費，玩小遊戲或是消費可獲得等同購物金的貓糧，一個貓糧等同1元，雙11當天可全額折抵，預計灑出上億元。另外，蝦皮購物則是預計砸千萬元預算促銷，祭出滿額免運外，將於本週四公布當天黑最殺折扣品等更多優惠。
