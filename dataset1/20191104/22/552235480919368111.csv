It was a day to remember for Rangers at Hampden and one to savour for James Tavernier .
The Ibrox skipper has come under fire for some high-profile mistakes but he was at his rampaging best in the 3-0 Betfred Cup semi-final win over Hearts on Sunday.
It's Tavernier's first victory at the national stadium as the club's captain enjoyed every moment of it...both on and off the pitch.
Rangers marked the big occasion by installing large player cards for each player on their locker and the 28-year-old made sure he didn't leave without it.
The club uploaded a clip of Tavernier looking proud as punch as he showed off his Hampden souvenir to the club's bus driver after the comprehensive win.
It was a big win for the Ibrox side but they know the sternest test is yet to come when they return on December 8 as they aim to put an end to Celtic's domestic dominance.
And Tavernier will be hoping it's not just a replica image he's leaving Mount Florida with as Steven Gerrard goes in search for his first trophy in management.
