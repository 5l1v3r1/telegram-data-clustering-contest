（中央社記者潘姿羽台北4日電）外資強勁匯入，台灣今天再次上演股匯齊揚戲碼，新台幣兌美元今天收30.405元，升值7.4分，再創逾15個月新高，前高紀錄為2018年7月10日的30.403元。
受惠美股大漲、熱錢湧入兩大題材，今天不只新台幣強升，台股也大漲157.32點，收在11556.85點，指數續創29年新高，且三大法人全數買超，其中外資及陸資買超146.88億元。
新台幣兌美元今天開盤價為30.475元，最高30.382元、最低30.475元；外匯交易員表示，新台幣今天開盤後一路走升，進口商、投信美元買盤也有進場，但不敵外資匯入的力道，新台幣高檔盤旋，收盤價格續創波段新高。
儘管新台幣走揚，成交量卻沒有放大，台北及元太外匯市場總成交金額僅11.53億美元，外匯交易員推測，主要是台股持續創新高，易有「居高思危」的想法，加上國際不確定性尚未完全消除，市場抱持觀望心態所致。
即便如此，外匯交易員認為，亞洲新興市場資金行情仍在，統計顯示，外資已經連16日買超，匯入力道將推動新台幣續往升值方向邁進，但因美元走弱時會有逢低進場買盤，使得新台幣呈現「緩升」格局。（編輯：楊玫寧）1081104

Despite the rise of the new Taiwan dollar, the transaction volume has not been amplified. The total transaction volume of the Taipei and Yuantai foreign exchange markets is only 1.153 billion US dollars.

International uncertainty has not been completely eliminated, and the market is holding on to the wait-and-see attitude.
Even so, foreign exchange traders believe that the funds market in emerging markets in Asia is still there.
