      <p>Kerry Katona has revealed she is suffering from intense pain and that he "can barely stand up straight."</p>
      <p>The former pop singer, 39, who was rushed in to hospital last month with a mystery illness has discussed her health and fears she has endometriosis - a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes.</p>
      <p>Writing in her New! magazine column, out this week, Kerry shared: "You may have seen me out and about looking very uncomfortable - it's because I'm still in such awful pain with my back. I can barely stand up straight. I'm sick of crying about it, but it's really restricting me.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to a clinic later this month to see a gynae specialist, but early indications suggest it's endometriosis, which can take years to diagnose."</p>
