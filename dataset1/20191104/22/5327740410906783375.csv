B.C.’s police watchdog is recommending criminal charges against three Kamloops RCMP officers.
The Independent Investigations Office announced on Monday that it has forwarded a report to Crown prosecutors recommending assault charges for one Mountie and criminal driving charges relating to the alleged conduct of three officers.
The investigation stems from an early-morning Dec. 8, 2018, collision between an unmarked police car and a stolen pickup truck.
