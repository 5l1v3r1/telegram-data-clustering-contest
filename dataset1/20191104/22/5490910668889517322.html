      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/barneys/">Barneys</a> New York isn’t the only asset billionaire hedge funder Richard Perry is off-loading.</p>
      <p>Amid all the chaos surrounding <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/barneys-end-liquidation-authentic-brands-bankruptcy-retail-1203360736/">the sale of the iconic department store chain to Authentic Brands Group</a>, Perry and his fashion designer wife Lisa Perry have been working on their side gig: Florida <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/real-estate/">real estate</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the years the duo has quietly built up a mini-property empire in the exclusive Palm Beach area and are now hoping to make a few million dollars on one of those investments, listing a manse for $10.9 million with broker Burt Minkoff of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</p>
      <p>That price represents a steep markup from the $6.5 million they paid for the six-bedroom, 5,700-square-foot Palm Beach Island abode only last year. The reason for that appears to be a massive renovation, overseen by Lisa’s new home design firm, Lisa Perry Homes.</p>
      <p>The home is her first project since “Lisa Perry: Fashion, Homes, Design,” her $85 coffee-table book focusing on fashion, homes and interior design, was published by Assouline.</p>
      <p>“My new business involves finding, buying and renovating homes,” she said in a release. “I then fill them with everything I love — from new and vintage furniture and lighting to artwork and M&amp;Ms — all with the idea that the buyer can move right in with as little as a suitcase.”</p>
      <p>The redesign on this particular home included opening it up by removing walls between rooms and adding large swathes of glass in order to merge interior and exterior living spaces. A big art collector herself, Lisa then decked out the walls in all white so they could act as a blank canvas for her bright furnishings and art, sourced from travels between the U.S. and France.</p>
      <p>The Perrys already own a 6,000-square-foot house in Palm Beach they bought in 2011, as well as several condominiums in the area. When they’re in Manhattan, they reside in a <a href="https://wwd.com/eye/parties/lisa-perry-throws-10-year-anniversary-party-in-pop-art-filled-home-11025364/">Pop Art-filled penthouse</a> overlooking the Queensboro Bridge, complete with a huge Jeff Koons-designed metallic-green diamond holding center stage on the terrace.</p>
      <p>News of the home sale came as <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/barneys-new-york-authentic-brands-group-abg1203361294-1203361294/">Barneys</a> was sold to ABG on Friday for $271.4 million through a bankruptcy proceeding. Perry gained control of the luxe chain back in 2012 through a debt-for-equity swap, but it subsequently struggled with crippling rent increases for its stores and tough competition from the likes of Net-a-porter. That led to a bankruptcy this year for the second time after months of declining traffic and sales and erratic payments to vendors.</p>
