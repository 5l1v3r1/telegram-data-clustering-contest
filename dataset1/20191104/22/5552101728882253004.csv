高雄監獄發生受刑人疑遭私刑死亡，死者陳瑞卿雖因家暴及毒品造成家人諸多困擾，但八旬老母親及6個姊姊始終沒放棄他，即使他入獄，仍幫他照顧8歲的兒子，每月也都會去監獄探望、寄錢。陳家親友說，陳這次坐牢時間長，似乎也有悔改之意，多次表示出來後一定會找份穩定工作，照顧兒子。
陳瑞卿在10月初還透過牧師打電話給姊姊，表示監獄將於11月2日在台南走馬瀨農場舉辦活動，希望那天姊姊能帶兒子來和他碰面。

陳瑞卿的二姊提到弟弟死亡至今的狀況，忍不住數度痛哭，她激動表示：「雖然他犯罪，但已經到獄中為自己的錯誤付出代價，他們（管理員和獄友）沒有權力要他的命！」

陳瑞卿就讀國小二年級的兒子也非常傷心，哭喊著：「爸爸答應我，要回來陪我住，還要買文具給我，我不要爸爸死掉！」陳年邁的母親不忍兒子枉死、孫子沒有父親，也常常以淚洗面，晚上入睡還夢到死者好幾次，要她保重身體。
