      <p>MUMBAI: Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) will now have to maintain liquid reserves to ensure that they have a buffer for any unexpected requirements.</p>
      <p>The new rules are a fallout of the crisis in the sector following defaults by large firms like IL&amp;FS Financial Services. The liquidity norms announced by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/RBI">RBI</a> on Monday, will apply to most NBFCs like the ones lending to real estate developers and retail consumers for housing, vehicle and microfinance loans.</p>
      <p>The only NBFCs exempt from this will be pure-play investment companies and government bond dealers.</p>
      <p>The liquid reserves have to be in high-quality assets like government bonds, debt securities or actual cash that is adequate to fund 30 days of operations. The presence of liquid reserves will prevent an <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NBFC">NBFC</a> from going into a default spiral if some inflows get delayed. There have been instances of NBFCs being downgraded and having their loans recalled after they failed to meet an instalment to a lender.</p>
      <p>While earlier NBFCs were not required to maintain liquidity ratios, now the RBI has asked them to monitor cash outflows for a seven-day period. Based on that, NBFCs are supposed to arrive at how much cash they would need for a 30-day period using liquidity monitoring tools used by banks. By December 1, 2020, NBFCs with loan portfolio/asset size of Rs 10,000 and above will have to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 50%, and NBFCs with asset size of Rs 5,000-10,000 crore will have to maintain a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/LCR">LCR</a> of 30%. After this, the RBI has increased LCR limits year-on-year for NBFCs — by December 1, 2024, all NBFCs will have to maintain a LCR of 100% akin to banks.</p>
      <p>So far, NBFCs were only required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 15%, unlike private banks which had a mandatory CAR requirement of 9% and PSBs 12%. However, with the new liquidity norms, NBFCs players said their margins are likely to go up as cost of operations increase.</p>
      <p>“For an NBFC with a loan portfolio of Rs 5,000 crore, on average the cost of operation could be Rs 500-750 crore in a month (10-15% of asset size). Now if we have to keep that money unused or buy assets for that much — our margins will be under pressure. It is already a very tough business to be in,” said an NBFC’s CEO.</p>
      <p>The move, NBFC players said was aimed only at the large players and not for NBFCs with asset size of between Rs 100-5,000 crore. “It’s these large players that pose a systemic risk of Rs 1-lakh-crore assets failing. So, that is what the RBI is trying to prevent....similar to the concept of “too big to fail” with the 2008 financial crisis,” said the CEO.</p>
