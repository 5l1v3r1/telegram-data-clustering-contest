【淘寶大軍壓境4】消費者賺到　買淘寶貨也有7天鑑賞期、超商取付
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 林育緯
隨著雙11購物節倒數計時，中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下的電商平台淘寶，今年在台灣以嶄新面貌重新出擊，授權台灣業者代理經營，正式宣告合法落地，強勢殺入電商市場，提供繁體中文化介面、7天鑑賞期、本地退貨，以及更為安心的超商取貨付款，把過去淘寶令人詬病的痛點一一改善，準備全力進攻台灣市場。
淘寶是中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下C2C（Customer to Customer，客戶對客戶）型態的購物網站之一，去年集團營收高達人民幣3768億元，約新台幣1.62兆元，較前一年增長51%，僅次於美國亞馬遜，更是創造出席捲全球雙11購物節的創始電商。
本刊調查，淘寶過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，依循蝦皮購物模式，由台灣業者取得品牌授權代理經營，以「淘寶台灣」名號捲土重來，名正言順的正式落地，強勢殺入電商市場，提供繁體中文化介面、7天鑑賞期、本地退貨，以及更為安心的超商取貨付款，把過去淘寶令人詬病的痛點一一改善，準備全力進攻台灣市場。
上週五（1日），淘寶授權代理商英商克雷達行銷長林雅雯，顧不得新辦公室還在整修，接受本刊獨家專訪，「淘寶對於台灣消費者很熟悉，但好感度還不夠，我們要強化本地化服務，包括便捷的退貨機制、多元付款方式等。」林雅雯補充，「請把全新的『淘寶台灣』和現有的『手機淘寶』當做兩家不同的公司，而『淘寶台灣』是由台灣團隊經營。」
林雅雯坦言，「我們是一個多元化的平台，有公司貨、也有俗稱的水貨，提供消費者多元選擇，同樣的商品價格的確會比現有的『手機淘寶』略高，因為需要支應在地化營運成本。」
記者實際操作「淘寶台灣」全新平台發現，無疑地蛻變成道地的台灣電商，操作介面跟目前蝦皮、PChome等相似，可望吸引到以往搞不懂集貨及直送差異的消費者。
為了要讓台灣消費者從原先的「手機淘寶」，願意轉向本土化的「淘寶台灣」平台消費，首先便豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了鋪天蓋地的包下捷運站、公車等鬧區戶內外廣告，吸住眾人目光外，最能打動消費者的，就是在平台上推出超狂折扣，雙11期間超過千萬項商品祭出零元免運費，還有1元清空價值百萬元的購物車等優惠活動。

Taobao is one of China's e-commerce leader Alibaba's C2C (Customer to Customer) type of shopping site, last year's group revenue of up to 376.8 billion yuan, about NT$1.62 trillion, compared with the previous year It is 51% growth, second only to Amazon.com, and it is the founding e-commerce company that attended the global double 11 shopping festival.
In this survey, Taobao has failed to make several orders due to legal restrictions. This year, following the shrimp shopping model, Taiwanese companies have obtained brand authorization agency operations, and the name of “Taobao Taiwan” has come back. The name is justified and officially launched. The market, providing a traditional Chinese cultural interface, a 7-day appreciation period, local returns, and a more secure super-commercial payment, improved the pain points of Taobao in the past, and prepared to attack the Taiwan market.
Last Friday (1st), Taobao authorized agent Yingke Kerada marketing Chang Lin Yawen, refused to accept the new office is still undergoing renovation, accept an exclusive interview with this magazine, ""Taobao is very familiar with Taiwanese consumers, but the good feeling is not enough We need to strengthen localization services, including convenient return mechanisms, multiple payment methods, etc. Lin Yawen added, ""Please treat the new ""Taobao Taiwan"" and the existing ""Mobile Taobao"" as two different companies, and Taobao Taiwan is operated by the Taiwan team.""
Lin Yawen said frankly, ""We are a diversified platform, there are corporate goods, also known as parallel imports, providing consumers with multiple choices. The same commodity prices will indeed be slightly higher than the existing ""mobile Taobao"" because of the need to support localization. Operating costs.""
The reporter's actual operation of the ""Taobao Taiwan"" new platform found that it has undoubtedly become a Taiwanese e-commerce company. The operation interface is similar to the current shrimp skin, PChome, etc., and it is expected to attract consumers who have not understood the difference between the collection and direct delivery.
In order to let Taiwanese consumers move from the original ""Mobile Taobao"" to the localized ""Taobao Taiwan"" platform consumption, they will first be eager to make a billion-dollar marketing campaign, in addition to the overwhelming package of the MRT station and bus. Waiting for indoor and outdoor advertisements in the downtown area, attracting everyone's attention, the most impressing consumers is to launch a super-freak discount on the platform. During the double 11 period, more than 10 million items will be offered free shipping, and 1 yuan will be cleared. A million-dollar shopping cart and other special offers.
