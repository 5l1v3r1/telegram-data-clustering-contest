Barfoot & Thompson's auction numbers jump sharply with the sales rate hovering around 50%
04 Nov 2019, 22:00 by Greg Ninness
There was a big jump in activity at Barfoot & Thompson's auction rooms in the week after Labour Weekend (October 28-November 3) with the real estate agency processing 147 auction properties compared to 107 the previous week (+37%).
The sales rate continued to hover around the 50% mark with sales achieved on 70 of the properties, giving a clearance rate of 48% compared to 52% the previous week
The biggest auction of the week was at Manukau where three dozen properties from south and east Auckland suburbs were offered and exactly half were sold.
The Shortland Street auction on October 30 wasn't far behind with 34 properties on offer, mostly from central Auckland suburbs such as Glendowie, Remuera, Orakei, Greenlane, Mt Albert and Mt Eden, plus a few from western suburbs such as Henderson and West Harbour, with an overall sales rate of 53%.
At the big North Shore auction 30 properties were offered and the sales rate was 43%.
A notable feature of recent auctions is the relatively low number of properties being withdrawn from sale prior to their auction, with just one withdrawn from Barfoot's auction last week, although three properties had their auction dates postponed.
See the table below for the full results of all Barfoot's auctions last week, while details of the individual properties offered are available on our Residential Auctions Results page.
