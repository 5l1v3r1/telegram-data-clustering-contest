      <h1><i>Fantastic Beasts</i> Takes ‘Come to Brazil!’ Twitter Literally, Sets Third Film in Rio</h1>

      <p><i>Accio,</i> Grindelwald and all of his pretty-boy crimes. A year after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/what-does-the-ending-of-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-mean.html">the most recent</a> <i>Fantastic Beasts </i>film <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/jude-law-on-dumbledore-sexuality-gay-fantastic-beasts-2.html">flirted with Dumbledore’s sexuality</a> and made <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-enchants-the-weekend-box-office.html">a whole lot of money</a>, Warner Bros. confirmed a third film in the <i>Potter</i>-adjacent franchise, tentatively titled <i>Fantastic Beasts 3, </i>will begin production in spring 2020. Per <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/fantastic-beasts-3-jessica-williams-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-1202777066/">Deadline</a>, the drama will move away from France in favor of exploring the wizarding culture of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Terry Gilliam <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/did-you-catch-the-brazil-reference-in-the-last-jedi.html">is shaking</a>!), with the entire cast returning and presumably bonding over some cachaça: Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Katherine Waterston, Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, and Dan Fogler. Additionally, Jessica Williams’s role as Professor Eulalie “Lally” Hicks has expanded and will become more prominent. As with the previous two <i>Fantastic Beasts </i>films, J.K. Rowling is confirmed to write the script, and the chances of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTizYn3-QN0">dancing on the sand</a> have now doubled.</p>
