      <h1>Aragon Opposes Change to Ethereum's Mining Algorithm Before 2.0 Version</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:45:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>The Aragon community has officially proclaimed itself against ProgPOW. ProgPOW is a proposed protocol change to the Ehereum network that would close the efficiency gap available to application-specific integrated circuits. </p>
      <p>In a tweet on Nov. 2, the official account of the Aragon project <a href="https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1190669728362254339">posted</a> voting results, showing that a proposal to block changes to Ethereum’s mining algorithm had passed.</p>
      <p>ProgPOW would change the Ethereum network’s proof-of-work mining algorithm before the eventual switch to a proof-of-stake model as part of the Ethereum 2.0 roll-out. Aragon, which is an open-source software project for creating and managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), uses Ethereum smart contracts.</p>
      <p>In October, Aragon <a href="https://blog.aragon.org/final-details-for-aragon-network-vote-4/">announced</a> its latest Aragon Network vote, where Aragon (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/aragon-ant">ANT</a>) token holders were able to cast their votes on a variety of proposals, including changes to Ethereum's mining algorithm. The proposal states:</p>
      <blockquote>“ANT holders who vote ‘yes’ on this proposal oppose Ethereum changing its proof-of-work mining algorithm before the switch to proof-of-stake as part of the Ethereum 2.0 roll-out, unless such change is intended as an ‘emergency fix’ to a fatal flaw in the current mining algorithm. A ‘fatal flaw’ is defined here as a flaw that breaks the expected functionality of Ethereum.”</blockquote>
      <p>The vote passed with almost 860,000 tokens voting yes on the proposal to oppose, while 390,000 voted no. </p>
      <p>In a tweet on Nov. 3,  Aragon One CTO Jorge Izquierdo <a href="https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/1191214560285474816">said</a> that the Aragon team will respect the community’s decision and take it seriously. </p>
      <h3>Ethereum’s Istanbul hard fork expected to break 680 smart contracts on Aragon</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of October, Izquierdo <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aragon-expects-ethereums-istanbul-hard-fork-to-break-680-smart-contracts">said</a> that the Ethereum network’s Istanbul upgrade will break roughly 680 smart contracts on the Aragon platform. Izquierdo added that DAOs on Aragon will no longer be able to receive Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) from one another, stating, “The issue we’re going to have hasn’t been deemed important enough for this hard fork not to happen, which from our point of view is unfortunate [but] it’s a hard balance we understand.”</p>
