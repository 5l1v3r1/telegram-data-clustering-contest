Jorge Masvidal calls out Canelo Alvarez following stoppage win over Diaz: ‘If Canelo wants to get his ass kicked, that’s a fight I’ll take’
04 Nov 2019, 22:30 by Lewis Mckeever



Jorge Masvidal could be looking to follow in the footsteps of Conor McGregor following his stoppage win over Nate Diaz at UFC 244.
McGregor temporarily put his MMA career on hold to face Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a boxing match back in 2017 and, speaking to reporters at the UFC 244 post-fight press conference, Masvidal teased of his own boxing superfight against multi-division champion Canelo Alvarez, who knocked out Sergey Kovalev this past Saturday to capture the WBO light heavyweight title.

‘Gamebred’ believes he has the skills to beat Alvarez at his own game, telling the media he would have no problem whopping Canelo’s ass if the opportunity presented itself.
“I’m open to the money and [Diaz is] a money fight,” Masvidal said, per MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin. “If Canelo wants to get his ass kicked, that’s a fight I’ll take,” Masvidal said. “I’m just here to get the biggest checks possible but Nate is in the future for a fact. We’re doing it next year or the year after that but it’s going to happen.”
“I can box. I can hit hard. I’ve got different angles. I’m not going to get tired in a 12 round boxing event, especially if I have time to prepare for it,” he added. “It’s just kind of fate. He’s fighting today, I’m fighting today. I heard we f*cking killed him on the pay-per-views.
“I don’t know I’d like to break his face. Just fight, just test myself, make a lot of money for testing myself. But I truly feel I could make it 1-1 MMA versus boxing.”

Masvidal thrashed Diaz in the UFC 244 main event to win the ‘BMF’ title and extend his win streak to 3-0, winning all three fights by way of stoppage. As well as being crowned the ‘baddest motherf-cker’ in the world, Masvidal holds the record for the fastest KO in UFC history (five seconds), KO’ing former ONE FC and Bellator welterweight champ Ben Askren with a flying knee at UFC 239 back in July.
