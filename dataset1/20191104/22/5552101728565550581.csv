日本員工太講究太執著　她當老闆一肩扛下壓力
04 Nov 2019, 22:28 by 祁玲, 洪偉韜, 林雅菁
2013年秋天，Studio 4℃的電腦動畫人員提議，要把五十嵐大介的同名漫畫《海獸之子》改編成動畫電影，身兼製片和公司創辦人的田中榮子，首先要面臨的挑戰就是：「究竟要不要花這麼多時間和金錢來做這部電影？」



看過試做的2分鐘短片、決定放手一搏之後，接下來她的挑戰就是：錢從哪裡來？日本國內的資金來源絕對不足以支應，於是她帶著企畫書和尚未拍完的影片，跑遍世界各地的發行商和授權商，一家家登門造訪。

田中榮子日前應台中國際動畫影展之邀來台，出席《海獸之子》映後座談，分享製作甘苦。她說：「除了籌資辛苦，另一個痛苦就是工作人員太執著製作這部片。每個鏡頭都非常講究，少則重拍兩、三次，多則拍了十次以上，有些鏡頭前後花3年才拍完。」

例如某個片段拍完後，大家看了覺得不錯，就繼續往下拍。等到把這些已完成的片段剪接在一起，卻發現上一個版本比較好，所以得重來一次。劇本也是邊拍邊改，而非寫完才拍，所以很難說花了多久的時間才完成。
《海獸之子》描述中學女生琉花，與一對由儒艮撫養長大的兄弟「海」與「空」相遇後，展開一場奇異旅程，目前已在台上映。

Japanese employees are too particular about being too persistent.

In the fall of 2013, Studio 4°C computer animators proposed that the first challenge to be the first film of the eponymous comic book ""The Son of the Sea Beast"", which is also the producer and founder of the company, is: ""Which is the challenge?"" Do you want to spend so much time and money on this movie?""



After watching the 2 minute short film and trying to let go, the challenge is: Where does the money come from? The source of funds in Japan is definitely not enough to support, so she went to the publishers and licensees around the world with a picture book and a film that has not yet been filmed.


The comic version of ""The Son of the Sea Beast"" has a delicate and magnificent style, which was once regarded as difficult to adapt. (Revolving from outsiders.com.tw)

At the invitation of the Taichung International Animation Film Festival, Tian Zhongrong was invited to Taiwan to attend the discussion after the ""Child of the Sea Beast"" and share the production of bitterness. She said: ""In addition to the hard work of fundraising, another pain is that the staff is too persistent to make this film. Every shot is very particular, and it is very repetitive, two or three times, and more than ten times. Some shots take 3 years before and after. Finished.""


Takashi Tanaka was invited by the Taichung International Animation Film Festival to attend the post-mortem discussion of ""The Son of the Sea Beast"" and share the production of bitterness. (Available on entertainment)

For example, after a certain clip is taken, everyone looks good and continues to shoot. Wait until the completed pieces are clipped together, but I found that the previous version is better, so I have to repeat it. The script is also changed while shooting, not just after writing, so it is difficult to say how long it takes to complete.
""The Son of the Sea Beast"" describes the middle school girl's flowers, and after a meeting with a pair of brothers raised by the Confucianism, ""Sea"" and ""Empty"", they started a strange journey and are now on stage.
