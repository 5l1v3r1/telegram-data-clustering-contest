【綠直搗韓營1】總統要贏得先贏高雄　蔡英文找她掌全國兵符
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 黃揚明, 賴智揚
距離明年總統選舉投票只剩2個多月，蔡英文總統力拚連任，本月中旬起陸續成立各縣市競選總部，16日將率先成立高雄市競總，直搗國民黨對手、高雄市長韓國瑜大本營。











本刊調查，因副手尚未正式宣布，蔡英文全國競總主委人選仍未拍板，2日蔡、賴台南同框輔選立委後，黨內研判「蔡賴配」可望成形，總統府祕書長陳菊連莊擔任競總主委的呼聲最高。
蔡英文與前行政院長賴清德2日在台南首度同框，為民進黨立委林俊憲站台助選，隔天蔡、賴一前一後在高雄輔選民進黨立委李昆澤，營造黨內團結氣氛。蔡英文在台南與賴同框後直呼：「並肩作戰的感覺很好啊！」雖然她對副手人選仍不鬆口，但不斷訴諸團結，黨內研判「蔡賴配」水到渠成，近日就會掀底牌。


總統府祕書長陳菊可望再次擔任蔡英文全國競選總部主委，操盤選戰。

趕在總統及立委選舉登記前，高雄市競總更搶先全國及各縣市競總，於本月16日成立。由於高雄是由國民黨總統候選人韓國瑜主政，率先成立競總，直搗黃龍意味濃厚。11月17日，全國競選總部及北市競總也將成立。
本刊調查，儘管蔡英文各縣市競總人事架構已底定，但距離全國競總成立只剩一個多禮拜，競總主委職務卻仍懸而未決。上屆大選時任高雄市長的陳菊，早在選前5個月就已被委由競總主委重任並對外公布，這次主委遲未定案，其實與副手人選未定有關。
蔡陣營輔選人士透露，總統初選後蔡英文和賴清德互動不多，幕僚原規劃賴若未擔任副手，就力勸他接競總主委，團結綠營支持者。但蔡、賴9月下旬會面後合作機會轉濃，近一個多月隨著黨內醞釀蔡賴配成形，競總主委也跟著連動，持續懸空保持彈性。
蔡、賴經歷初選後沉澱，到同框輔選立委，如今連曾公開反對賴擔任副手的蔡英文台南市後援會會長郭信良，態度也趨軟，表示若蔡賴配成真，他會有一段適應的陣痛期，似乎認同蔡賴配已箭在弦上。可望為蔡賴配執掌兵符的陳菊，3日也表態說，蔡賴合作愉快，適當時機蔡總統會向國人表達副手人選。
對此，蔡競辦發言人阮昭雄表示，目前競辦運作都很順暢，主委人選沒有急迫性，全國競總成立前就會確定。

[Green straight Han Ying 1] The president wants to win the first win of Kaohsiung.
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Huang Yangming, Lai Zhiyang
There are only two months left in the presidential election next year. President Tsai Ing-wen is working hard to re-elect. From the middle of this month, the county and city election headquarters will be established one after another. On the 16th, Kaohsiung City will be established first, and the Kuomintang opponent, Kaohsiung Mayor, Korea Yu Base camp.











In the investigation of this journal, due to the fact that the deputy has not yet officially announced, the candidates for the Tsai Ing-wen National Competition General Committee have not yet made a decision. On the 2nd, after Cai and Lai Tainan joined the legislature, the party’s judgement, ""Cai Lai-Fu"" is expected to take shape. Secretary-General Chen Julianzhuang has the highest voice as the chief executive of the competition.
Tsai Ing-wen and former Executive Dean Lai Qingde were in the same box for the first time in Tainan on the 2nd. They helped the Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lin Junxian to help the election. The next day, Cai and Lai were in the Kaohsiung auxiliary election of the Democratic Progressive Party legislator Li Kunze to build the party. The atmosphere of unity. Tsai Ing-wen screamed in the box between Tainan and Lai: ""It feels good to fight side by side!"" Although she still does not relax on the deputy's candidate, she continues to resort to unity, and the party's internal judgment ""Cai Lai"" is a matter of course.掀 cards.


Chen Ju, the secretary general of the presidential palace, is expected to serve as the chairman of the Tsai English National Campaign Headquarters again.

Before the election of the president and the legislature, Kaohsiung City was the first to compete in the country and the counties and cities. It was established on the 16th of this month. Since Kaohsiung was headed by the Kuomintang presidential candidate, South Korea, the first to set up a competition, the direct meaning of Huanglong is strong. On November 17, the National Campaign Headquarters and the North City Competition will also be established.
In this survey, although the general personnel structure of Tsai Ing-wen's prefectures and cities has been set, there is only one week left before the establishment of the national competition, but the position of the main committee is still pending. Chen Ju, who was the mayor of Kaohsiung in the last general election, had been appointed by the General Manager of the General Administration of the Communist Party of China five months before the election and was announced to the public. The main committee was not finalized, but it was actually related to the deputy.
Cai Cai camp assistants revealed that after the presidential primary election, Tsai Ing-wen and Lai Qing-de did not interact much. The original plan of the aides, Lai Ruo, did not serve as a deputy, and urged him to take over the general committee and unite the supporters of the green camp. However, after Cai and Lai met in late September, the opportunity for cooperation became stronger. In the past more than a month, with the formation of Cai Lai in the party, the main committee of the competition also followed suit and continued to remain flexible.
Cai and Lai went through the primary election and settled. They went to the same box to assist the legislators. Now even Guo Xinliang, the president of the Taiwan-Taiwan Southern Support Association, who has publicly opposed Lai’s deputy, has a softer attitude, saying that if Cai Lai is true, he There will be a period of painful adaptation, and it seems that Cai Lai has already been on the string. Chen Ju, who is expected to be in charge of Cai Lai, said on the 3rd that Cai Lai has a pleasant cooperation and that the appropriate time is that President Cai will express the deputy candidate to the Chinese.
In this regard, Cai Jingxiong spokesperson Yan Zhaoxiong said that the current operation of the competition is very smooth, and there is no urgency in the selection of the main committee. The national competition will be determined before the establishment of the competition.
