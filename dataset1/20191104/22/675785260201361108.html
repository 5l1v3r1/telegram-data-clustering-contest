      <h1>Son Heung-min went over the top with reaction to Andre Gomes challenge</h1>
      <h2>Everyone could see that it was not the Tottenham mans fault but his reaction bordered on the extreme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:31:59+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p>The injury <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andre-gomes">Andre Gomes</a> suffered against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Sunday was not a nice one.</p>
      <p>I know because I suffered the same fracture dislocation playing for Leicester City against Derby County in 2000.</p>
      <p>His fracture will likely be an inch or two long, not too bad.</p>
      <p>The bad part of the injury will be the fact the ankle ligaments have been strained and torn — they will need a lot of massaging to stop them going gluey and to ensure they grow back, which they will.</p>
      <p>I had a titanium plate fitted to get me back playing again and I did it in six weeks and two days, which I was very proud of.</p>

      <p>As footballers, and particularly those of us who have suffered bad injuries, you are perhaps a little more conditioned to dealing with these incidents than most.</p>
      <p>And perhaps that’s why the reaction of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/son-heung-min">Son Heung-min</a> and his Tottenham team-mate Serge Aurier was the aspect that I found most uncomfortable about the whole situation.</p>
      <p>I am not saying they shouldn’t have been upset or shown distress, because these are normal human emotions.</p>

      <p>But, for a while now, I have been bothered that players and managers seem to think they must show an extreme version of their emotions because of the comeback they will get if they do not.</p>
      <p>The way Son reacted made it look like he thought football — the referee, the authorities, fans at home and in the crowd, opponents – was going to come down on him like a ton of bricks, even though we could all see he didn’t deliberately go out to cause Gomes’ injury.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, footballers seemingly have to go over the top to present themselves before the court of public opinion and that needs to stop.</p>
