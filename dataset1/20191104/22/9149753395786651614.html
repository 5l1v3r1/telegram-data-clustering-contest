      <h1>Intel's Core i5-9600KF processor is just $200, its lowest price ever</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:33:13+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>If you're in the process of building a new gaming PC, or you have some upgrades planned for the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a> season, you might be interested in this deal. One of Intel's unlocked mid-range processors, the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/190884/intel-core-i5-9600kf-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html">Core i5-9600KF</a>, is just $199.99 right now. This <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-for-gaming/">CPU is great for gaming</a> and usually goes for $215-240, and this is the lowest recorded price (at least on Amazon).</p>
      <p>This is a 9th-generation 95W Coffee Lake processor, with 6 cores and no hyper-threading. It has a base clock of 3.70GHz, and it can overclock to 4.7-5GHz when paired with a decent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-cpu-coolers/">CPU cooler</a>.</p>
      <p>Note that you <i>will</i> need to bring your own coolerâ€”like all Intel K-series processors, there's no heatsink in the box. In the case of this KF model, there's also no integrated graphics, so you'll need a dedicated graphics card. Not that you'll care if you plan on playing games, as Intel's UHD Graphics 630 often struggles at 720p, never mind 1080p.</p>
