      <h1>Truth behind why X Factor: All Stars has been scrapped as Simon Cowell 'in crisis'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: A planned series called X Factor All Stars has been axed at the last minute</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:00:09+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Simon Cowell is facing the biggest challenge of his TV career with the prospect of The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> running out of hit singers and viewers.</p>
      <p>A planned series called X Factor All Stars has been axed at the last minute as Cowell struggled to get big name former stars to take part, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Leona Lewis is among those believed to have backed out.</p>
      <p>Amid chaotic meetings behind-the-scenes, the music mogul cancelled his 60th birthday party last week, flew in his closest confidantes for advice and allegedly sacked six staff in a week as he worked tirelessly to save his brand.</p>

      <p>But at the weekend The X Factor: Celebrity series, which features Nicole Scherzinger as a judge, drew its lowest ratings yet of 3.1 million.</p>
      <p>The embarrassing figures add to Cowell’s woes as ITV bosses have yet to sign a new contract for X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent next year.</p>
      <p>A TV source claimed: “Cowell did not have a happy birthday and this is now a real crisis for the show. He has struggled to get anyone to take part in All Stars.”</p>

      <p>Yesterday Cowell revealed plans for a new X Factor show next month called X Factor: The Band. It is being rushed out to premiere before a similar BBC show called The Search, featuring Little Mix.</p>
      <p>But Cowell played down claims of a crisis saying: "When I cancelled my birthday party it was written I was in some sort of crisis mode. I swear to God I’m having the time of my life."</p>

      <p>A senior exec who works with Cowell also insisted last night that he was not panicking about the current situation.</p>
      <p>The source said: “Simon has really rolled his sleeves up and is determined to make both the current series and X Factor: The Band a big success. He is more focused on work than he has been in years.</p>
      <p>“All Stars has been ­postponed until 2020, it wasn’t cancelled because of a lack of big acts. “The new contract with ITV has not been formally signed But there are only a few minor details being finalised.”</p>
