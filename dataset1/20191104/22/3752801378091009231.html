      <p>A Nobel Peace laureate added her voice Monday to calls for Chile to stop police violence against protesters during recent weeks of deadly anti-government unrest.</p>
      <p>Protests against economic hardship have erupted into vandalism, looting and clashes between demonstrators and police, leaving 20 dead.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say five of those people died at the hands of state agents. A UN human rights mission is investigating allegations of police brutality.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the 1992 Nobel Peace Laureate, Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala, led other activists in delivering a letter at the presidential palace urging an end to what they called "serious and systematic" abuses.</p>
      <p>They called on Chile's President Sebastian Pinera to "immediately halt the violence" by security forces.</p>
      <p>Chile's independent National Human Rights Institute says it has brought legal action over 179 cases including alleged murders, sexual violence and torture by the military police.</p>
      <p>The institute's director, Sergio Micco, denied that the abuses constituted a systematic government policy, however.</p>
      <p>The institute says 1 574 people have been hurt in the unrest.</p>
      <p>"Terrible acts of repression have been carried out by members of the security forces and other state agents," said the letter, read out by activist Guillermo Whpei.</p>
      <p>Menchu backed protesters' calls for constitutional reform in Chile. The current constitution dates back to the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p>
