      <p>JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- Family, friends and a high school community gathered Monday to bid a final farewell to Aamir Griffin, the teen who was <a href="https://abc7ny.com/innocent-teen-killed-on-basketball-court-by-stray-bullet-/5652828/">shot and killed last month</a> while playing basketball with his friends in Queens.</p>
      <p>The 14-year-old was not the target of the shooting, and his death has sparked calls for justice as police continue to search for his killer.</p>
      <p>His funeral was held Monday morning at the Greater Allen Cathedral.</p>
      <p>"He didn't deserve this, he was a good kid," friend Delissa Chamble said. "I know everybody is going to miss him."</p>
      <p>Griffin's casket arrived in grand fashion, by horse-drawn carriage.</p>

      <p>He was known for his big smile, his dimples, and his love of basketball.</p>
      <p>In fact, he had just made the JV team at Cardozo High School when stray gunfire took his life on the court outside his home.</p>
      <p>"It happened to an innocent bystander," friend Janiyah Hill said. "He was in the park playing basketball. Whatever is going on needs to stop."</p>
      <p>In the days following his death, Eyewitness News spoke with his coach, Ron Naclerio.</p>
      <p>"They get guns as easy as we go to a bodega and get a Pepsi or a Coke," Naclerio said. "And these kids are probably missing school later this week for the wrong reason, to bury a teammate."</p>
      <p>Many of his teammates attended his funeral.</p>
      <p>"He was just smiling in everybody's face, trying to make sure everybody was OK," Chamble said. "He never was a negative person. He never brought negative energy to the crowd. He was always happy, and this is a shame."</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
