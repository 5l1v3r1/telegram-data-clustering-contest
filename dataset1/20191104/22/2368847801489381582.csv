習近平上海見林鄭 稱對她「高度信任」

04 Nov 2019, 22:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】此前英媒傳出北京準備撤換港首林鄭月娥的消息，有學者稱代表「某派勢力的想法」。日前習近平在上海接見林鄭，稱對她「高度信任」，並強調繼續「止暴制亂」。
新華社11月4日報導，出席第二屆上海進博會的習近平，會見了同來參會的林鄭月娥。在聽取了林鄭關於香港局勢的匯報後，習近平對林鄭和港府在「修例風波」5個月中「努力穩控局面的工作」給予「充份肯定」，並稱「中央對你高度信任」。
在會見中，習近平再次強調要「堅定不移」的「止暴制亂、恢復秩序」，並指是當前香港「最重要的任務」。同時，也要做好「與社會各界對話和改善民生等工作」。他還要求香港社會各界人士「全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』」和《基本法》，共同維護香港的繁榮穩定。
報導說，中辦主任丁薛祥以及中共中央港澳小組副組長楊潔篪、王毅、趙克志等參加了會見。
日前英國《金融時報》傳出消息稱，北京正考慮明年3月前撤換林鄭，另外指定「臨時行政長官」。該報導一度引起海內外關注。因此，習近平在上海「高度肯定」林鄭的報導一出，迅速引發港媒反應。
據港媒此前報導，林鄭5日還將赴北京出席粵港澳大灣區會議，6日將獲中共中央港澳小組組長韓正接見。這將是韓正首次公開會見林鄭。
觀察人士認為，北京突然高調挺林鄭，可能有替林鄭去職「闢謠」之意。北京打算撤換林鄭的消息傳出時，港府官媒曾引述分析指，這代表「北京某派勢力的想法」，並稱另外指定「臨時港首」有違《基本法》。
「林鄭下台」是港人「五大訴求」之一。北京力挺林鄭，或顯示拒不妥協之意。剛剛結束的中共四中全會，也明確要對香港加強管制。
但也有評論認為，北京「肯定」林鄭，並不代表不會撤換她，可能只是「輿論維穩」。2005年香港前特首董建華因為「23條立法風波」提前下台前，北京也曾公開對他表示「肯定」。

Xi Jinping, Shanghai, sees Lin Zheng, saying that she is ""highly trusting""

04 Nov 2019, 22:17

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Before the British media reported that Beijing was preparing to replace Hong Kong’s first forest Zheng Yuejun, some scholars claimed to represent ""the idea of a certain faction."" Recently, Xi Jinping met Lin Zheng in Shanghai and said that she ""highly trusts"" her and stressed that she will continue to ""stop the storm.""
Xinhua News Agency reported on November 4 that Xi Jinping, who attended the second Shanghai Expo, met with Lin Zhengyue, who was attending the conference. After listening to Lin Zheng’s report on the situation in Hong Kong, Xi Jinping gave “full recognition” to Lin Zheng and the Hong Kong Government’s “Working hard to stabilize the situation” during the five months of the “remediation storm”. trust"".
During the meeting, Xi Jinping once again stressed the need to ""unswervingly"" the ""stopping the storm and restoring order"" and referring to the ""most important task"" of Hong Kong at present. At the same time, we must also do a good job of ""talking with the community and improving people's livelihood and other work."" He also asked people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to ""completely and accurately implement the ""one country, two systems"" and ""Basic Law"" to jointly safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
The report said that Ding Xuexiang, the director of the Central Office, and Yang Jiechi, Wang Yi and Zhao Kezhi, deputy heads of the Hong Kong and Macao Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting.
A few days ago, the British ""Financial Times"" reported that Beijing is considering the removal of Lin Zheng before March next year, and the appointment of ""Interim Chief Executive."" The report once attracted attention at home and abroad. Therefore, Xi Jinping’s “highly affirmative” Lin Zheng’s report in Shanghai quickly triggered a reaction from the Hong Kong media.
According to Hong Kong media reports, Lin Zheng will also go to Beijing to attend the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Dawan District meeting on the 5th. On the 6th, he will be interviewed by Han Zheng, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Central Committee of the CPC Central Committee. This will be Han Zheng’s first public meeting with Lin Zheng.
Observers believe that Beijing suddenly has a high profile of Lin Zheng, and may have the intention of ""resolving"" for Lin Zheng. When Beijing’s intention to withdraw Lin Zheng’s news came out, the official media of the Hong Kong government quoted the analysis as saying that this represented “the idea of a certain faction in Beijing” and said that the appointment of the “temporary port head” violated the Basic Law.
""Lin Zheng is stepping down"" is one of the ""five major demands"" of the people of Hong Kong. Beijing is strong against Lin Zheng, or it shows that it refuses to compromise. The just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party also clearly wants to strengthen control over Hong Kong.
However, some commentators believe that Beijing’s “affirmation” of Lin Zheng does not mean that she will not be replaced. It may be just “public opinion and stability”. In 2005, before Hong Kong’s former Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa stepped down in advance because of the ""23 legislative storms"", Beijing also publicly expressed ""affirmation"" to him.
