【圖解另類ETF】這2種ETF和你想的不一樣　12張圖讓你速懂

這2種ETF和你想的不一樣！槓桿及反向型ETF適合短期、波段操作，同時要做好風險控管，並設好停利和停損點，以免長期持有的成本吃掉淨值。現在就快來了解槓桿及反向型ETF的差異！
近年來，ETF成為時下火紅的投資商品！根據證交所統計，台灣已有超過200檔ETF掛牌，資產規模更高達1.4兆元。
目前市面上，除了傳統的原型ETF之外，還有2種相當熱門的ETF進階型產品，分別是槓桿型ETF、反向型ETF。2014年7月，金管會開放投信推出槓桿型和反向型ETF以來，已成為外資避險新工具、散戶追捧的新寵。
尤其是當台股站上萬點之後，有些投資人居高思危，開始買進反向型ETF做空台股，也就是追蹤標的指數報酬反向表現的ETF。其中，「元大台灣50反一」還曾經一度成為全球規模最大的反向型ETF。
至於槓桿型ETF，它的操作模式是透過金融衍生性商品讓投資績效加乘，可以幫助投資人賺得超額利潤。舉例來說，如果指數報酬率為1％，2倍槓桿型ETF就是2倍、得到2％報酬率；但如果遇到指數下跌時，損失也是2倍。
有別於原型ETF，槓桿型和反向型ETF的報酬率都是以單日為基準，並透過買賣相關期貨、每日轉倉來達到模擬指數的效果。由於頻繁進出，槓桿型和反向型ETF的交易成本較高，長期產生的成本會一點一滴吃掉基金的淨值，且持有越久成本越高。
雖然這2種ETF提供投資人更多樣性的投資策略，但操作難度也較高，投資人須先搞懂商品再投入。現在就透過以下圖文，快速掌握反向型、槓桿型ETF和原型ETF的差異，以及適合的操作策略。

[Illustrated Alternative ETF] These two ETFs are different from what you think. 12 pictures let you know quickly.

These two ETFs are different from what you think! Leverage and reverse ETFs are suitable for short-term, band-operated operations. At the same time, risk control should be done, and stop and stop loss points should be set up to avoid the long-held cost of eating net worth. Come and see the difference between leverage and reverse ETF now!
In recent years, ETFs have become a hot investment commodity! According to the statistics of the stock exchange, Taiwan has more than 200 ETFs listed, and the asset size is as high as 1.4 trillion yuan.
Currently on the market, in addition to the traditional prototype ETF, there are two quite popular ETF advanced products, namely the lever type ETF and the reverse type ETF. In July 2014, the Financial Management Commission opened its investment letter to launch leveraged and reverse ETFs. It has become a new tool for foreign investment hedging and a new favorite of retail investors.
In particular, when the Taiwan stocks stood tens of thousands of points, some investors were at high risk and began to buy reverse ETF short-selling stocks, which is the ETF that tracks the reverse performance of the underlying index. Among them, ""Yuanda Taiwan 50 anti-one"" also once became the world's largest reverse ETF.
As for the leveraged ETF, its mode of operation is to increase the investment performance through financial derivative goods, which can help investors earn excess profits. For example, if the index return rate is 1%, the 2x leveraged ETF is 2 times, and the 2% return rate is obtained; but if the index falls, the loss is also 2 times.
Different from the prototype ETF, the return rates of leveraged and reverse ETFs are based on a single day, and the effect of the simulated index is achieved by trading relevant futures and daily rollovers. Due to frequent entry and exit, the transaction costs of leveraged and reverse ETFs are higher, and the long-term costs will eat the net value of the fund bit by bit, and the longer the cost, the higher the cost.
Although these two types of ETFs provide investors with a more diversified investment strategy, they are more difficult to operate, and investors must first understand the re-investment of goods. Now let's quickly grasp the differences between reverse, leveraged ETFs and prototype ETFs, and the appropriate operational strategies through the following illustrations.
