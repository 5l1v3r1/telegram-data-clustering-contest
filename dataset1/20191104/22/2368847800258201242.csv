全民監控再升級 中共在新疆測試「情緒識別」技術

04 Nov 2019, 22:13

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月05日訊】近日，中共以預防犯罪為由，在新疆的機場等公眾場合利用新研發的情緒辨識技術來分析行人的情緒及心理狀態的做法，在海外引起輿論非議。專家學者指出，情緒識別並非新技術，但中國是第一個公然在社會上廣泛使用這種技術的國家。政府利用電子高科技對民眾實行全面監控，等於給全中國人都戴上電子監控腳環，本質上是把所有人都視為罪犯或嫌疑人。
英國《金融時報》11月1日報導，中共繼人臉辨識後，近期再推出情緒辨識技術，試圖通過分析被拍攝人士的情緒和心理狀態來判斷哪些人可能是潛在的「犯罪份子」。據報相關技術已在新疆大規模試驗應用，嘗試對街上行人的情緒狀態進行辨別，以作出相應的「安全」應對。其它地區的一些機場和地鐵站，也陸續在設置這個檢測系統。
香港東網則報導稱，中國在近日舉辦的中國國際社會公共安全博覽會上推出的期間情緒辨識技術引起各方的廣泛關注。該報導引述新疆阿勒泰地區公安局治安支隊長、號稱智慧安防人工智能技術專家的李曉宇稱，除新疆外，目前海關也正在建置該技術，以辨識民眾是否有緊張等跡象，及判斷其是否可能攻擊他人。
李曉宇並透露，當局已就技術與各種業者或機構合作，包括人工智能領域較強的阿里巴巴與騰訊，以及新疆政府等。
此外，《華爾街日報》報導稱，中國浙江金華市金東區孝順鎮中心小學的學生們，在學校被要求配戴「監控頭環」上課，以接受學校的監測，相關資訊還將發送給家長。此事經外媒披露引發爭議後，目前官方已下令暫停。但消息沒有提及「監控頭環」對人體健康是否危害。
針對上述消息，清華大學法學院教授勞東燕發文批評北京地鐵採用人臉識別系統存在法律問題，她並表示擔心公民個人生物特徵信息遭當局濫用，她質疑當局這樣做究竟是要保護誰？又是在防範誰？
勞東燕在文章中表示，她特別不能接受這些防範措施是「政府善意保護」的說法。因為掌控數據的人並不是天使一般的存在，把個人安全的問題，寄希望於別人的忽視時，其實是一場賭博。
針對中國已經在新疆大規模試驗「情緒識別」系統的問題，美國電子通訊工程博士龔叔佳對自由亞洲電台表示，情緒識別並非新技術，但在社會上廣泛使用中國是第一個。
龔叔佳舉例說，在巡邏警察經過時，該系統可能可以判斷一個人是高興、緊張或是憤怒，而通過大數據和人工智能，將該人信息傳送給警方。如果這一系統獲得全面推廣，中國社會將陷入難以想像的恐懼之中。
他說：「就是到什麼地方見了什麼人？思想傾向、表情甚至心裏想什麼？都可以通過類似的技術進行運算。這種對社會的監控深入到了每一個毛孔。過去歷史上還可以腹誹心謗，對政權不滿意，在路上還可以通過眼神來表示。現在一個眼神都會被他（中共政府）看到。」
他表示，中共通過高科技對民眾實行全面電子監控，等於是為全中國人都戴上了電子監控腳環，本質上是把所有人都視為罪犯或嫌疑人。
龔叔佳分析說，中共19屆四中全會公報中的重點之一是「推進國家治理體系和治理能力現代化」，而對民眾全面監控，是其中重要一環。
「共產黨現在經濟方面碰到特別嚴重的挑戰，經濟下滑。過去通過經濟手段安撫老百姓，現在也不行了，所以必須依靠這種赤裸裸的暴力手段了。」
旅美中國法律學者滕彪也表示，個人資訊和個人隱私，是個人權利的重要組成部份，也是個人人身自由的一部份。這在國際人權標準中早有規定。在缺乏個人權利保障的制度下，中國當局全力推動高科技全面監控，將使中國的人權侵害日益嚴重，其衍生的各種問題也將在未來逐一爆發。

National monitoring and upgrading, the CCP tests ""emotional recognition"" technology in Xinjiang

04 Nov 2019, 22:13

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 05, 2019] Recently, the CCP has used publicly developed emotional recognition technology to analyze the emotional and psychological state of pedestrians in public places such as airports in Xinjiang on the grounds of crime prevention, causing public opinion overseas. Non-consideration. Experts and scholars pointed out that emotion recognition is not a new technology, but China is the first country to openly use this technology widely in society. The government's use of electronic high-tech to comprehensively monitor the public is equivalent to wearing an electronic surveillance foot ring for all Chinese, essentially treating everyone as a criminal or suspect.
The British ""Financial Times"" reported on November 1 that after the face recognition, the Chinese Communist Party recently introduced emotion recognition technology to try to determine who may be potential ""criminals"" by analyzing the emotional and psychological state of the person being photographed. It has been reported that relevant technologies have been applied in large-scale trials in Xinjiang, and attempts have been made to identify the emotional state of pedestrians on the street in order to respond accordingly. Some airports and subway stations in other regions are also setting up this detection system.
The Hong Kong Eastern Network reported that the period of emotional recognition technology launched by China at the China International Public Safety Expo held recently attracted wide attention. The newspaper quoted Li Xiaoyu, the head of the public security bureau of the Altay Prefecture Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang, and the expert in intelligent security technology. He said that in addition to Xinjiang, the customs is currently building the technology to identify whether the public is nervous or not, and to determine whether it is possible. Attack others.
Li Xiaoyu also revealed that the authorities have cooperated with various industries or institutions on technology, including Alibaba and Tencent, which are strong in the field of artificial intelligence, and the Xinjiang government.
In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported that students at the Xiaoshun Town Central Primary School in Jindong District, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China were required to wear a “monitoring headband” to receive school monitoring and relevant information would be sent to parents. After the matter was triggered by foreign media disclosure, the official has ordered a suspension. However, the news did not mention whether the ""monitor headband"" is harmful to human health.
In response to the above news, Tsinghua University Law School professor Lao Dongyan criticized the Beijing subway for using the face recognition system for legal problems. She also expressed concern that the citizen's personal biometric information was abused by the authorities. She questioned the authorities to protect who is doing this? Who is guarding against it?
Lao Dongyan said in the article that she is particularly unacceptable that these preventive measures are ""government goodwill protection."" Because the person who controls the data is not an angel's existence, it is actually a gamble when the issue of personal security is hoped for the neglect of others.
In response to China's large-scale trial of the ""emotional recognition"" system in Xinjiang, Dr. Gong Shujia, a Ph.D. in electronic communication engineering in the United States, told Free Radio that emotional recognition is not a new technology, but it is the first widely used in society.
For example, Gong Shujia said that when the patrol police passed, the system may be able to judge whether a person is happy, nervous or angry, and send the information to the police through big data and artificial intelligence. If this system is fully promoted, Chinese society will fall into unimaginable fear.
He said: ""Where did you meet someone? Thoughts, expressions, and even what you think in your heart? You can use similar techniques to perform calculations. This kind of monitoring of society has penetrated into every pore. In the past, history can also be abdomen. Hey, dissatisfied with the regime, can also be expressed through the eyes on the road. Now a look will be seen by him (the Chinese government).
He said that the CCP's comprehensive electronic surveillance of the people through high technology is tantamount to wearing an electronic surveillance foot ring for all Chinese people, essentially treating everyone as a criminal or suspect.
Gong Shujia analyzed that one of the key points in the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee was ""promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity,"" and comprehensive monitoring of the people is an important part of this.
""The Communist Party is now facing particularly serious economic challenges and the economic downturn. In the past, the economic people have been used to appease the people. It is not going to work now, so we must rely on this naked violent means.""
Teng Wei, a Chinese law scholar in the United States, also said that personal information and personal privacy are an important part of individual rights and part of personal freedom. This has long been stipulated in international human rights standards. In the absence of a system of personal rights protection, the Chinese authorities' full efforts to promote comprehensive monitoring of high technology will make China's human rights violations increasingly serious, and various problems arising therefrom will also erupt in the future.
