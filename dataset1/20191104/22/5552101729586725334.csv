【綠直搗韓營4】合體百萬級網紅自製內容　小英空戰奪勝絕招
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 黃揚明, 賴智揚
歷次選戰民進黨最擅長的就是文宣及網路空戰，這次也不例外。蔡英文從年初成功型塑「辣台妹」形象，網路聲量與掀起「韓流」的韓國瑜不相上下，近期在網路社群經營策略更求新求變。本刊調查，蔡英文網路社群有3大特色：合體網紅、自製內容、推廣政策。



上週蔡英文競辦官網增設社群專區「小英日常」，首推「總統府大冒險」網路冒險遊戲及「萬人共筆：小英安價」活動，上線3天流量突破50萬人次，訴求與網友互動更緊密。
蔡英文今年3月重啟YouTube頻道後，陸續與蔡阿嘎、館長、千千、三原JAPAN等百萬粉絲級網紅合體。蔡的自製內容還包括「總統去哪裡」「小英做什麼」「英文英文」「台菜與它們的產地」「辣台派開講」等系列，多以非政治類內容吸引網友點閱。
小英自製影片常置入政府推動政策，例如與蔡阿嘎打外交牌、對館長談國防、和三原JAPAN拚觀光等，都吸引數十萬次點閱。加上各網紅頻道會再發影片讓小英曝光，例如蔡阿嘎的「嘎名人尬台語」影片，上線7個月已吸引超過220萬次點閱，讓非英粉、不常看政治新聞的網路族群也能得知蔡政府推動的政策和政績。
11月1日蔡阿嘎發布韓國瑜陣營邀約拍片的影片，卻引發他的「衣食父母」粉絲洗版說：「不想看！」讓蔡阿嘎緊急澄清，只是趁機做個民調，了解大家的好惡，「沒有拍啦，大家先別激動！」可見蔡英文在網路社群戰中優勢非常明顯。
在總統府操盤蔡英文網路社群的前發言人林鶴明，10月中旬正式進入競辦擔任文宣群副執行長。他說，過去半年來支持蔡英文群眾有三大主要族群，包括傳統綠營支持者回流、支持婚姻平權族群以及重視主權的年輕族群，而「蔡英文支持者大於民進黨支持者」現象很明顯，未來如何把蔡的網路聲量化為動員力，是最重要的課題之一。
林鶴明說，選戰規劃上會努力把蔡英文的空戰優勢納入立委戰局，擁有60萬人追蹤的蔡英文LINE@官方帳號，9月底推出總統與立委同框照以來，讓支持者可透過介面點選所在選區的立委候選人，平均每位立委候選人都有5、600人次製作同框照。
此外，林鶴明指出，10月起競辦發言人自製節目《一起吃早餐》，每天邀立委選將同框，除了回應時事、澄清謠言，也透過蔡英文臉書等網路社群推播，讓英粉能更深入地接觸立委候選人，帶動立委選情。

[Green straight Han Hang 4] fit a million-level net red homemade content Xiaoying air combat wins tricks
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Huang Yangming, Lai Zhiyang
The best choices of the DPP during the elections were the propaganda and cyber warfare, and this time is no exception. Tsai Ing-wen succeeded in shaping the image of ""Spicy Taiwanese Girl"" from the beginning of the year. The volume of Internet traffic is comparable to that of South Korea, which has set off ""Korean Wave"". Recently, the online community business strategy has been changing. According to our survey, Tsai Ing-wen's online community has three major characteristics: fit network red, homemade content, and promotion policies.



Last week, Tsai Ing-wen's official website added a social zone ""Xiaoying Daily"", which was the first to promote the ""Presidential Government Adventure"" online adventure game and the ""Millions of Pens: Xiaoying An Price"" campaign. People, appeals and users are more closely interacted.
After Tsai Ing-wen restarted the YouTube channel in March this year, he gradually merged with a million fan-level network such as Cai Ayi, curator, Qian Qian, and Sanyuan JAPAN. Cai's self-made content also includes ""Where is the President going"", ""What does Xiaoying do"", ""English and English"", ""Taiwanese and their origin"", ""Spicy Taiwanese Open"" and other series, which attract non-political content to attract users to read.
Xiaoying’s homemade films are often placed in government-driven policies, such as playing diplomatic cards with Cai Ayi, talking about the defense of the curator, and sightseeing with Sanyuan JAPAN, all of which attract hundreds of thousands of clicks. In addition, each channel will send a video to Xiaoying. For example, Cai Ayi’s ""Famous Celebrity and Taiwanese"" film has attracted more than 2.2 million readings on the line for 7 months, making non-English powder, not often seen. The online community of political news can also learn about the policies and achievements promoted by the Cai government.
On November 1st, Auntie Ai released a film about the filming of the Korean Yoga camp, but it triggered his ""food and clothing parents"" fans to say: ""Don't want to see!"" Let Aunt Cai clarify urgently, just take the opportunity to make a poll and understand everyone. The likes and dislikes, ""No shots, everyone should not be excited!"" It can be seen that Tsai Ing-wen has an obvious advantage in the online community war.
Lin Heming, a former spokesperson for the Tsai Ing-wen network community in the presidential palace, officially entered the competition in mid-October as the deputy chief executive of Wen Xuanqun. He said that in the past six months, the support of Tsai Ing-wen has three major ethnic groups, including the return of traditional green camp supporters, the support of marriage-fair ethnic groups and the young people who value sovereignty. The phenomenon of ""Tsai in English supporters is greater than DPP supporters"" is obvious. How to quantify Cai's network voice as mobilization in the future is one of the most important topics.
Lin Heming said that the election campaign will strive to incorporate Tsai Ing-wen's air combat advantage into the legislator's battle. There are 600,000 follow-ups of Tsai Ing-wen LINE@ official account. Since the end of September, the president and legislators have been photographed together, so that supporters can Through the interface to select the candidates for the legislators in the constituency, the average number of candidates for each legislator is 5,600 person-times.
In addition, Lin Heming pointed out that from October onwards, the spokesperson’s self-produced program “Drinking Breakfast Together” was invited to set up a meeting every day. In addition to responding to current events and clarifying rumors, it was also promoted through online communities such as Tsai Ing-wen’s Facebook. Let Yingniu have more in-depth contact with the legislators and drive the legislators' election.
