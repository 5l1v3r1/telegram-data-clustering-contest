      <h1>Neil Lennon delivers Scott Brown Celtic quip and hints at contract change of heart</h1>
      <h2>Brown suggested his latest deal will likely be his last but Lennon is adamant the skipper has plenty left in the tank.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:29:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Evergreen <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> could be handed a contract extension that sees him continue to lead Celtic from the front until at least 2022.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead skipper's sensational form at the age of 34 has convinced boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> that talks over adding to Brown's current deal that ends in the summer of 2021 are worth considering.</p>
      <p>The midfielder hinted heavily at the signing of his latest deal that it will probably be his last but Lennon is adamant Brown has plenty left in the tank - and he's proving it week after week.</p>
      <p>He was outstanding as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> made the final of the Betfred Cup against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> on Saturday and Lennon's captain will be leading his side once again on Thursday night as the Hoops take on Lazio in Rome.</p>

      <p>Lennon said: "He’s incredible. And I think he’s playing as well as ever.</p>
      <p>"I look at Rangers away, Lazio, Hibs on Saturday, Aberdeen away and other games.</p>
      <p>"He had a little bit of a toe problem at the start of the season, that was curtailing him. But he’s over that now.</p>
      <p>"As for another contract, the way he’s playing at the minute, it might cost us a few bob!</p>
      <p>"It will depend on how he’s feeling and how he’s playing at the time. I think he’s got another year after this one.</p>
      <p>‘We’ll take a view of that maybe this time next year, with him as well.</p>
      <p>"He’s in a good place and the players respect him and look up to him.</p>
      <p>"He’s not in the team as a cheerleader. He’s in the team because he’s a bloody good player.</p>
      <p>"And he keeps churning out consistent performances that we don’t take for granted."</p>

      <p>Brown grabbed a brace at the weekend and Lennon says he's delighted his skipper is contributing to the scoring charts, but admitted his eye for goal is a bonus.</p>
      <p>He added: "He scored a couple of really important goals last year. And he’s come up again with two against Hibs.</p>
      <p>"And we’re getting goals from everywhere.</p>
      <p>"Callum McGregor scored again, which I’m delighted with, because that’s him on five or so for the season.</p>
      <p>"Forrest is scoring. Edouard, Elyounoussi, Christie … so it’s the sum of all those parts, really.</p>
      <p>"But if Scott is then weighing in with goals, on top of what he already does for the team, I’m delighted with that."</p>
