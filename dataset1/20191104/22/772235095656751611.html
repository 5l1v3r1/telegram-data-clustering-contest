      <p>The <b>Lister SUV-E</b> previews a new addition to the company's range: a modified version of the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/i-pace/">Jaguar I-Pace</a> electric crossover.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/lister/">Lister</a> has fitted the crossover with a new bonnet, front and rear splitters, front and rear bumpers, and roof spoiler made from carbon-fibre. There's also carbon ceramic brakes, and Lister-designed titanium wheels.</p>
      <p>These changes are said to reduce the car's weight by around 100 kilograms to 2033kg.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Lister said it has liberated more power and torque from the I-Pace's two-motor electric powertrain via a software update. Although how much more it has over and above the 294kW/696Nm I-Pace is unknown at this stage.</p>
      <p>Lister claims the SUV-E will have a 0-60mph (0-97km/h) time of around 4.0 seconds, down from the I-Pace's 4.5s.</p>
      <p>Other changes include a fully adjustable lowered suspension system, wheel arch extensions, and a new louder fake exhaust sound system to comply with the EU's low-speed electric vehicle regulations.</p>
      <p>The cabin will feature Nappa leather available in 60 colours and complemented by 200 stitching colours. Buyers will also be able to select any hue they want for the exterior.</p>

      <p>According to Lister, the SUV-E will only be produced in a limited run, although quite how small that number is depends on the number of pre-orders received.</p>
      <p>In the UK, the SUV-E will be priced from £125,000 ($235,000), a significant step up from the regular I-Pace, which kicks off from £60,995 ($115,000).</p>
