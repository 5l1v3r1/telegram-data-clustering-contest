檢調偵辦高雄監獄受刑人陳瑞卿死亡案，懷疑雄監管理員對陳瑞卿遭圍毆知情不報，涉嫌縱容重刑犯教訓陳，恐因眾人下手過重，重擊陳的腦部，導致他在晚餐後不久，被自己的嘔吐物噎死，意外釀成命案。
本刊調查，由於陳瑞卿前科累累、經常進出監獄，加上經常暴怒，是獄方管理上的頭痛人物，日前更因違反獄中規定被關進違規房。但此次和陳同舍房的都是殺人、擄人勒贖等重刑犯，相較之下，陳只是個家暴吸毒犯，卻還經常在獄中惹事且不服從管教，因此被看不過去的獄友盯上。


陳瑞卿疑似在違規房與獄友肢體衝突，晚餐後不久，突然倒地嘔吐、送醫不治。圖為示意圖。

涉嫌痛毆陳瑞卿致死的4名受刑人中，包含2名殺人犯，1人涉犯妨害自由，另1人則因擄人勒贖被關。其中，以5年前共謀犯下綁架陳姓台商及陳姓超跑代理商，勒索3億元天價贖金，創下國內擄人勒贖最高紀錄的劉子榮最為人所知，劉被判刑4年確定，原本出監在即，如今卻又因此案遭到收押。


高雄地檢署（圖）偵辦陳瑞卿命案，將4名受刑人、2名管理員聲押獲准。

另一名涉嫌痛毆陳瑞卿的受刑人蕭明俊，2006年7月因友人遭打，攜槍到高雄市觀音山區與對方談判，朝對方車輛開槍，子彈意外打中坐在副駕駛座的女子造成死亡，被依共同殺人罪判刑14年。
另外2名動手的受刑人黃冠富、蔣秉益，則分別因槍砲及毒品案、街頭開槍殺人及毒品案，遭判刑11年、8年定讞。
