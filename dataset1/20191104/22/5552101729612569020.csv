【綠直搗韓營5】台灣難波萬是她　綠委輔選首設「總舵主」
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 黃揚明, 楊子磊, 陳毅偉
民進黨為達成總統勝選、國會過半目標，各地競選總部籌設過程集結黨內黨公職菁英，可說精銳盡出。例如行政院長蘇貞昌出任新北競總榮譽主委、行政院副院長陳其邁出任高雄競總榮譽主委。



在嘉義縣部分，海區立委蔡易餘與蔡英文聯合總部將於本月17日成立，蔡易餘邀請前縣長張花冠擔任台灣選舉史上首創的「總舵主」職務，可說別具創意。


前縣長張花冠擔任台灣選舉史上首創的「總舵主」職務。

蔡易餘表示，張花冠在嘉義縣擔任過2屆立委、2屆縣長，可說是嘉義政壇的主舵手，傳統的督導、顧問等輔選職務無法襯托她對嘉義的貢獻，因此決定用「總舵主」這個獨一無二的頭銜邀她加入輔選團隊。
至於過去曾傳出與張花冠不合的嘉縣山區立委陳明文，則力邀張出任競總後援會總督導，上月24日張也出席竹崎幹部授證儀式，象徵綠營在嘉義縣已成功整合。

In order to achieve the president's victory in the election and the half-goal goal of the National Assembly, the DPP's campaign to organize the headquarters to gather the party's internal public service elites can be said to be elite. For example, Executive Dean Su Yuchang served as the chairman of the New North Competition General Honorary Committee and Vice President of the Executive Yuan Chen Qimai as the chairman of the Kaohsiung Competition.



In the part of Chiayi County, the sea district legislator Cai Yiyu and Tsai Ing-wen's joint headquarters will be established on the 17th of this month. Cai Yiyu invited former county magistrate Zhang Huaguan to be the first ""master rudder"" in the history of Taiwan's election. It can be said to be creative.


Former county magistrate Zhang Huaguan served as the ""master rudder"" in the history of Taiwan's election.

Cai Yiyu said that Zhang Huaguan has served as the second legislator and two county magistrates in Chiayi County. It can be said that he is the main helmsman of Chiayi politics. The traditional supervisors, consultants and other auxiliary positions cannot set off her contribution to Chiayi. Therefore, she decided to use The unique title of the Helm Lord invited her to join the auxiliary team.
As for Chen Mingwen, a member of the Jiaxian Mountain District Committee who had been inconsistent with Zhang Huaguan in the past, he urged Zhang to be the general supervisor of the General Supporting Association. On the 24th of last month, Zhang also attended the Zhuqi cadre chartering ceremony, which symbolized the successful integration of Green Camp in Chiayi County.
