日本製作動畫以紙張為主　她支持數位化為地球盡心力
04 Nov 2019, 22:28 by 祁玲, 洪偉韜, 林雅菁
近年日本動漫產值逐年攀升，已於2017年突破兩兆日幣（約新台幣5,700億元），其中IP改編作品的吸金效應強。例如去年僅《多啦A夢：大雄的金銀島》《七龍珠超：布羅利》和《名偵探柯南：零的執行人》三部，就在全球創下新台幣95億元的票房，促使大家前撲後繼、從漫畫挖掘題材。



《海獸之子》製片田中榮子表示，想要改編一部作品，通常她會去找握有權利的出版社，等他們答應了再去找投資人。資金到位後，便要集結製作團隊，人員到齊就開始製作，這是大致的流程。至於像《海獸之子》的授權金額，或者是否會與出版社談分潤等細節，田中榮子直言，這些都是製作委員會的祕密，不能透露。
她也解釋：「每部作品的實際授權金，會視雙方對作品的期待程度和誠意而定。分成也是一樣。有些案子可能需要付出非常高，但如果出版社對授權改編意願很高，我反而會把分成比率降低。」

一直以來，日本製作動畫時，大部分的原畫還是以紙張為主。但田中榮子表示，如今數位作畫愈來愈盛行，是業界發展趨勢。她說：「製作動畫時，會把不動的背景和會動的角色分開處理，最後再把會動的角色疊回背景，過程中難免要微調，包括動作和表情等。此時若是用數位作畫，微調時就會非常快。」
另一個好處是，不論動畫師人在那裡，都可以把作品上傳，工作流程也會更迅速容易。她認為：「動畫界也要為地球盡一份心力，盡量少紙化才好。」

Japanese production animation is based on paper. She supports digitalization for the earth.

In recent years, the output value of Japanese animation has been increasing year by year. It has broken through two trillion Japanese yen (about NT$570 billion) in 2017, and the IP-influencing effect of IP adaptation works is strong. For example, last year only ""Doraemon: Daxiong's Treasure Island"", ""Dragon Ball Super: Broli"" and ""Detective Conan: Zero Executive"", set a new box office of NT$9.5 billion in the world, prompting everyone Before the succession, the theme of mining from comics.



""The Son of the Sea Beast"" producer Tanaka said that if he wants to adapt a work, she usually goes to the publishing house with rights, and they promise to go to the investor again. After the funds are in place, it is necessary to assemble the production team, and the staff will start to make the production. This is the approximate process. As for the amount of authorization such as ""The Son of the Sea Beast"", or whether it will talk to the publisher about the details, Tian Zhongrong said bluntly, these are the secrets of the production committee and cannot be disclosed.
She also explained: ""The actual authorization fee for each work will depend on the degree of expectation and sincerity of the two parties. The division is also the same. Some cases may need to be paid very high, but if the publisher is willing to adapt the authorization, I Instead, the ratio will be reduced.""


""The Son of the Sea Beast"" produced a film in the field, said that the digital painting process makes the animation production process fast and easy, and is the development trend of the industry. (Available on entertainment)

For a long time, most of the original paintings in Japan were based on paper. However, Tanaka said that the digital painting is becoming more and more popular today, which is the development trend of the industry. She said: ""When making an animation, the moving background and the moving character will be treated separately. Finally, the moving characters will be folded back into the background. In the process, it is inevitable to fine-tune, including movements and expressions. Painting, fine-tuning will be very fast.""
Another benefit is that the artist can upload the work and the workflow will be faster and easier, no matter where the animator is. She believes: ""The animation industry should also do its best for the earth, and try to make as little paper as possible.""
