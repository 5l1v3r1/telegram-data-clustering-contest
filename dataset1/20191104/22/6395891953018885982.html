      <p>The scenario happens every year as stores put out snowmen next to jack-o'-lanterns and the <a href="https://www.hallmarkchannel.com/schedule">Hallmark Channel begins airing Christmas specials</a> a week before Halloween.</p>
      <p>Next time it happens to you, tell the accuser that experts say you're doing a good thing.</p>
      <p>"In a world full of stress and anxiety," psychoanalyst Steve McKeown told <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/people-who-put-up-christmas-decorations-early-are-happier/">UNILAD</a>, "people like to associate to things that make them happy, and Christmas decorations evoke those strong feelings of the childhood."</p>
      <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin agreed. </p>
      <p>"The holiday season stirs up a sense of nostalgia. Nostalgia helps link people to their personal past and it helps people understand their identity. For many putting up Christmas decorations early is a way for them to reconnect with their childhoods," she told UNILAD.</p>
      <p>"Christmas decorating will spike dopamine, a feel-good hormone," psychologist <a href="https://www.today.com/home/decorating-christmas-early-makes-you-happier-science-says-t119186">Deborah Serani told</a> "Today."</p>
      <p>Decorating the outside of your house can have another benefit. A study published in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494489800106">Journal of Environmental Psychology</a> suggests a decorated house makes others think you are friendly. </p>
      <p>Study participants rated residents based only on photographs of their home and front yard. "As expected, a main effect for the decorated factor indicated that raters used Christmas decorations as a cue that the residents were friendly and cohesive," the researchers wrote.</p>
      <p>So go right ahead and embrace your inner Buddy the Elf, even if everyone around you is a Grinch.</p>
