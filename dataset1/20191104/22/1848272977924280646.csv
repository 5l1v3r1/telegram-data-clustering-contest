Codeforces Round #599
04 Nov 2019, 22:33 by gen
Hi guys!
Glad to invite you to Codeforces Round #599 to be held this Nov/06/2019 18:05 (Moscow time)!
My name is Evgeny Vihrov, this is already my 6th Codeforces contest as an author. To introduce myself, I have participated twice in the ACM ICPC Finals (2012, 2014) and currently I am co-coaching teams for the ICPC at the University of Latvia. This is my first solo round, and it took 3.5 years to make! (the last one was #347 with Alex_2oo8).
In this contest you will have to help Ujan deal with his renovation issues. Hopefully, everyone will find a problem matching their taste!
Huge thanks to arsijo for coordinating the preparation of the contest and for the patience with the frequent delays. :) Thanks to Xellos, Origenes, KAN and opukittpceno_hhr for generously testing the round. And as always, thanks to MikeMirzayanov for the panem et circenses Codeforces and Polygon systems!
Wish you an exciting round!
UPD1: McDic is joining as a coauthor of the contest (reasons to be revealed later)!

Div. 1: 500-1000-1500-2000-2500

UPD6: Editorial is posted.
