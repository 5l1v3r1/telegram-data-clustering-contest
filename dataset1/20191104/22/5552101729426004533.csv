五十嵐大介漫畫難改編？　他們大膽挑戰勇闖「神之領域」
04 Nov 2019, 22:28 by 祁玲, 蕭志傑, 洪偉韜, 林雅菁
日本動漫市場發展成熟，尤其熱衷改編IP作品。近期在台灣上映的動畫電影《海獸之子》便是改編自五十嵐大介的同名漫畫，由蒼井優、稻垣吾郎等配音，國寶級配樂家久石讓創作音樂。



電影描述中學女生琉花，與一對由儒艮撫養長大的兄弟「海」與「空」相遇後，展開一場奇異旅程。原作的畫風細緻瑰麗，題材涉及生命、海洋和宇宙等龐大世界觀，因此有業界人士視原著為無法拍成電影的「神之領域」。
不過，Studio 4℃的電腦動畫人員胸有成竹，並向製片田中榮子提議，要把漫畫《海獸之子》改編成動畫電影。他們認為已有能力以現有技術呈現豐富的線條和奔放的構圖，還為此製作了2分鐘的短片，在公司內部放映，做為是否繼續往下走的評量依據。


田中榮子坦言，《海》片從發想到完成耗時5年，漫長的籌資及製作過程讓身為製片的她備感煎熬。

田中榮子說：「我一看就想，完了，這要花很多錢、很多時間。」偏偏其他人都躍躍欲試，表達製作意願。陷入天人交戰的她最後決定放手一搏，關鍵也是驚訝於短片的成果，「原來動畫的技術已經能把影像表現到這個地步。」
電影描述琉花與媽媽的關係不佳，在學校社團也被排擠。暑假無所事事的她，偶然在父親工作的水族館遇見了「海」與「空」這對兄弟。在他們的引導下，琉花來到從未見過的神奇世界。《海獸之子》目前正在台上映。

Is it difficult to adapt the Fifty Fathoms? They boldly challenged the courage to ""the realm of God""
04 Nov 2019, 22:28 by Yan Ling, Xiao Zhijie, Hong Weiwei, Lin Yajing
The Japanese animation market has matured and is particularly keen to adapt IP works. The animated film ""The Son of the Sea Beast"", which was recently released in Taiwan, was adapted from the comic book of the same name from the 50-year-old Daisuke. It was dubbed by Aoi Jing, Inagaki-Uro, and the national treasure-level music player Hisaishi made music.



The film describes the middle school girl's flowering, and after a meeting with a pair of brothers raised by the dugong, ""sea"" and ""empty"", they started a strange journey. The original paintings are meticulous and beautiful, and the subject matter involves a huge worldview of life, ocean and universe. Therefore, some people in the industry regard the original as the ""land of God"" that cannot be made into a movie.
However, Studio 4 °C computer animators have a well-thought-out, and proposed to the film Tian Rong, to transform the comic ""Children of the Sea Beast"" into an animated film. They believe that they have the ability to present rich lines and unrestrained composition with existing technology. They also produced a two-minute short film for screening in the company as a basis for further evaluation.


Takashi Tanaka admits that the ""Hai"" film took five years to complete, and the long fundraising and production process made her feel as a producer.

Takashi Tanaka said: ""I think at first glance, it will take a lot of money and a lot of time."" Others are eager to try and express their willingness to make. When she got into the battle of the heavens, she finally decided to let go. The key was to be amazed at the results of the short film. ""The original animation technology has been able to show images to this point.""
The film description of the relationship between the flower and the mother is not good, and the school community is also crowded out. She did nothing during the summer vacation, and occasionally met the brothers of ""sea"" and ""empty"" in the aquarium where her father worked. Under their guidance, the flowers came to the magical world that they had never seen before. ""The Son of the Sea Beast"" is currently on stage.
