Police are hunting for suspects who fled the scene of a shooting after two men were left seriously injured with gunshot wounds.
The victims, aged 22 and 27, have been taken to hospital following reports a gunman opened fire outside a Sainsbury's local supermarket. 
Officers were called to the incident on Huddersfield Road, in Liversedge, West Yorkshire, at 7.10pm on Monday.
A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said it is believed the suspects made off in a car.
The road has been closed in both directions while officers investigate, and police are conducting high-visibility patrols to offer reassurance and support to the local community.
The spokesman said: ""Two men, aged 27 and 22, received gunshot wounds and have been taken to hospital for treatment to serious injuries.
""It is believed the suspects made away in a small, dark-coloured vehicle and inquiries are currently ongoing to trace the occupants.""
Police are appealing for anyone with dashcam footage or CCTV of the incident to contact them on 101.
