【淘寶大軍壓境5】對手批不繳稅　淘寶台灣霸氣回嗆
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 林育緯
淘寶過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，由台灣業者取得品牌授權代理經營，以「淘寶台灣」名號正式落地，強勢殺入電商市場，針對外界質疑，淘寶授權代理商英商克雷達行銷長林雅雯霸氣回應，「我們是淘寶的台灣授權代理商，正規合法註冊的台灣公司，該繳的稅一點都不會漏。」
本刊調查，淘寶過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，依循蝦皮購物模式，由台灣業者取得品牌授權代理經營，以「淘寶台灣」名號捲土重來，名正言順的正式落地，強勢殺入電商市場，提供繁體中文化介面、7天鑑賞期、本地退貨，以及更為安心的超商取貨付款，把過去淘寶令人詬病的痛點一一改善，準備全力進攻台灣市場。
上週五（1日），淘寶授權代理商英商克雷達行銷長林雅雯急著說清楚、講明白，顧不得新辦公室還在整修，接受本刊獨家專訪，「淘寶對於台灣消費者很熟悉，但好感度還不夠，我們要強化本地化服務，包括便捷的退貨機制、多元付款方式等。」林雅雯補充，「請把全新的『淘寶台灣』和現有的『手機淘寶』當做兩家不同的公司，而『淘寶台灣』是由台灣團隊經營。」
林雅雯坦言，「我們是一個多元化的平台，有公司貨、也有俗稱的水貨，提供消費者多元選擇，同樣的商品價格的確會比現有的『手機淘寶』略高，因為需要支應在地化營運成本。」
林雅雯話鋒一轉，談到近來的動盪，她言談間口氣明顯激動地說：「我們是淘寶的台灣授權代理商，正規合法註冊的台灣公司，該繳的稅一點都不會漏。」
根據經濟部商業司資料顯示，英商克雷達投資有限公司台灣分公司於今年7月4日核准登記，在台營運資金為新台幣2010萬元，經營事業包含國際貿易業、資料處理服務業、電子資訊供應服務業、第三方支付服務業等。
2013年11月，淘寶就以「香港商淘寶資訊股份有限公司」港商名義來台設立分公司，但當年便遭外界質疑其中資身份，直到2015年3月被經濟部認定違反中資來台許可辦法，應申請轉換為陸資卻未轉換，同年5月，對淘寶開罰24萬，並要求在6個月內停止或撤回在台投資，淘寶不服提出行政訴訟。
直到去年6月，淘寶在以中資身分取得經濟部執照，幾個月內積極拓展業務，包含與特力集團聯手開設實體店面、重設淘寶大學、並找招攬年輕網紅加入，還與LINE購物合作，動作十分積極。今年，淘寶以品牌授權方式，交由英商克雷達經營，全新「淘寶台灣」於10月正式上線。
挾著阿里巴巴的龐大資源，淘寶台灣這回豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，就是要在雙11年度電商大檔，一舉攻城掠地，而面對攻勢凌厲的電商巨擘來襲，本土電商要怎麼接招，外界都在看。

The new ""Taobao Taiwan"" was officially launched in October.
