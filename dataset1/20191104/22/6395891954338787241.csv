BOSTON - Red Sox designated hitter and outfielder J.D. Martinez will reportedly not opt out of his contract with the team, according to multiple reports. 
ESPN's Jon Heyman and MLB Network's Jeff Passan were the first to report the news, which broke just after 5 p.m. on Monday. Martinez had until midnight on Tuesday morning to inform the team if he was opting out or not. 






The Red Sox and Martinez, 32, agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract just before the start of the 2018 season. With Martinez deciding to stay with the club, the slugger is slated to make $23.75 million this season and $19.35 million in both 2021 and 2022. 


PREVIOUS: 



Martinez's current deal has opt-out availabilities after the upcoming 2020 season and following the 2021 season.  
In two years with the Red Sox, Martinez has accrued a .317 average and has hit 79 home runs while driving in 235 runs, according to BaseballReference.com, an online stat aggregator. He led the league in runs-batted-in (130) and total bases (358) in 2018 while helping the Red Sox win their fourth World Series this century.
