【淘寶大軍壓境2】不想被掛上中字招牌　淘寶變招重新落地
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 柯長錕, 林育緯
隨著雙11購物節倒數計時，中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下的電商平台淘寶，過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，授權英商「克雷達」代理經營，以嶄新面貌「淘寶台灣」重新出擊，正式宣告合法落地。
「『淘寶台灣』是淘寶真正落地台灣的開始，只有你想不到的，沒有你淘不到的！」上月23日，在北市華山文創園區「淘寶台灣」上線記者會，出身台灣、阿里巴巴集團首席市場官的董本洪，褪去畢挺西裝，身穿白襯衫配牛仔褲，腳踩黑色帆布鞋，一身年輕勁裝如同「淘寶台灣」嶄新面貌，一臉雀躍的宣布透過授權克雷達成立淘寶台灣，正式合法落地。
就在一場熱鬧喧騰的「淘寶台灣」上線記者會過後，反倒讓眾人留下滿腦問號，為什麼台灣人已經相當熟悉的淘寶還需要另一個新平台？而名不見經傳的代理商克雷達為何有能耐拿下授權代理？
本刊調查，淘寶過去因法令限制數度登台未果，今年，依循蝦皮購物模式，由台灣業者取得品牌授權代理經營，以「淘寶台灣」名號捲土重來，名正言順的正式落地，強勢殺入電商市場，提供繁體中文化介面、7天鑑賞期、本地退貨，以及更為安心的超商取貨付款，把過去淘寶令人詬病的痛點一一改善，準備全力進攻台灣市場。
淘寶是中國大陸電商龍頭阿里巴巴旗下C2C（Customer to Customer，客戶對客戶）型態的購物網站之一，去年集團營收高達人民幣3768億元，約新台幣1.62兆元，較前一年增長51%，僅次於美國亞馬遜，更是創造出席捲全球雙11購物節的創始電商。
上週五（1日），淘寶授權代理商英商克雷達行銷長林雅雯急著說清楚、講明白，顧不得新辦公室還在整修，接受本刊獨家專訪，「淘寶對於台灣消費者很熟悉，但好感度還不夠，我們要強化本地化服務，包括便捷的退貨機制、多元付款方式等。」林雅雯補充，「請把全新的『淘寶台灣』和現有的『手機淘寶』當做兩家不同的公司，而『淘寶台灣』是由台灣團隊經營。」
話鋒一轉，談到近來的動盪，她言談間口氣明顯激動地說：「我們是淘寶的台灣授權代理商，正規合法註冊的台灣公司，該繳的稅一點都不會漏。」
根據經濟部商業司資料顯示，英商克雷達投資有限公司台灣分公司於今年7月4日核准登記，在台營運資金為新台幣2010萬元，經營事業包含國際貿易業、資料處理服務業、電子資訊供應服務業、第三方支付服務業等。
談及公司股東成員，林雅雯則低調地回應，「阿里巴巴有微量投資，大股東是來自電商等產業背景。」至於詳細股東成員、簽約授權金、簽約合作年限等，仍是不能說的祕密。但對於即將到來的雙11購物節，新團隊倒是卯足全力應戰。
記者實際操作「淘寶台灣」全新平台發現，無疑地蛻變成道地的台灣電商，操作介面跟目前蝦皮、PChome等相似，可望吸引到以往搞不懂集貨及直送差異的消費者。
為了要讓台灣消費者從原先的「手機淘寶」，願意轉向本土化的「淘寶台灣」平台消費，首先便豪砸上億元大打行銷戰，除了鋪天蓋地的包下捷運站、公車等鬧區戶內外廣告，吸住眾人目光外，最能打動消費者的，就是在平台上推出超狂折扣，雙11期間超過千萬項商品祭出零元免運費，還有1元清空價值百萬元的購物車等優惠活動。

[Taobao army pressure 2] do not want to be hung on the Chinese signboard Taobao change recruits re-landing
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by Ke Changzhen, Lin Yuwei
With the countdown of the Double 11 Shopping Festival, Taobao, the e-commerce platform of China's e-commerce leader Alibaba, has failed to make several orders due to statutory restrictions. This year, it authorized the British businessman ""Krada"" to operate as a brand-new agent. Baotai Taiwan re-attacked and officially declared its legal landing.
""Taobao Taiwan is the beginning of Taobao's real landing in Taiwan. Only you can't think of it, you can't find it!"" On the 23rd of last month, at the ""Taobao Taiwan"" press conference in Huashan Wenchuang Park, North City, I was born in Taiwan. Dong Benhong, the chief marketing officer of Alibaba Group, has lost his suit, wearing a white shirt with jeans, black canvas shoes, and a young face like ""Taobao Taiwan"", with a new look, through the authorization of Kedar Established Taobao Taiwan, officially and legally.
Just after a lively press conference on the ""Taobao Taiwan"" online press, the people were left with a question mark. Why did Taobao, which is already familiar to Taiwanese, need another new platform? And why is the unknown agent, Kedar, able to take the authorized agent?
In this survey, Taobao has failed to make several orders due to legal restrictions. This year, following the shrimp shopping model, Taiwanese companies have obtained brand authorization agency operations, and the name of “Taobao Taiwan” has come back. The name is justified and officially launched. The market, providing a traditional Chinese cultural interface, a 7-day appreciation period, local returns, and a more secure super-commercial payment, improved the pain points of Taobao in the past, and prepared to attack the Taiwan market.
Taobao is one of China's e-commerce leader Alibaba's C2C (Customer to Customer) type of shopping site, last year's group revenue of up to 376.8 billion yuan, about NT$1.62 trillion, compared with the previous year It is 51% growth, second only to Amazon.com, and it is the founding e-commerce company that attended the global double 11 shopping festival.
Last Friday (1st), Taobao authorized agent Yingchao Kelu marketing Chang Lin Yawen rushed to make it clear and understand, and refused to accept the new office is still undergoing renovation, accepting an exclusive interview with this magazine, ""Taobao is very good for Taiwanese consumers."" Familiar, but the degree of goodwill is not enough. We need to strengthen localization services, including convenient return mechanism and multiple payment methods. Lin Yawen added, ""Please treat the new ""Taobao Taiwan"" and the existing ""Mobile Taobao"" as two. Different companies, and ""Taobao Taiwan"" is operated by the Taiwan team.""
When the words turned around and talked about the recent turmoil, she said with excitement in her speech: ""We are Taobao's Taiwan authorized agent, and the officially legally registered Taiwanese company will not leak the tax.""
According to the Business Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Taiwan branch of Yingshang Kerad Investment Co., Ltd. was approved for registration on July 4 this year. The working capital in Taiwan is NT$20 million. The business includes international trade and data processing services. Electronic information supply service industry, third-party payment service industry, etc.
When talking about the company's shareholders, Lin Yawen responded in a low-key manner. ""Alibaba has a small amount of investment, and the major shareholder is from the industrial background of e-commerce."" As for the details of shareholders, contract authorization, contracting cooperation, etc., it is still a secret that cannot be said. . But for the upcoming Double 11 Shopping Festival, the new team is fully committed to the battle.
The reporter's actual operation of the ""Taobao Taiwan"" new platform found that it has undoubtedly become a Taiwanese e-commerce company. The operation interface is similar to the current shrimp skin, PChome, etc., and it is expected to attract consumers who have not understood the difference between the collection and direct delivery.
In order to let Taiwanese consumers move from the original ""Mobile Taobao"" to the localized ""Taobao Taiwan"" platform consumption, they will first be eager to make a billion-dollar marketing campaign, in addition to the overwhelming package of the MRT station and bus. Waiting for indoor and outdoor advertisements in the downtown area, attracting everyone's attention, the most impressing consumers is to launch a super-freak discount on the platform. During the double 11 period, more than 10 million items will be offered free shipping, and 1 yuan will be cleared. A million-dollar shopping cart and other special offers.
