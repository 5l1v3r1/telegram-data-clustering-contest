日本動畫電影《海獸之子》描述琉花與媽媽的關係不佳，在學校社團也被排擠。暑假無所事事的她，偶然在父親工作的水族館遇見了「海」與「空」這對兄弟。在他們的引導下，琉花來到從未見過的神奇世界。《海獸之子》目前正在台上映。



電影從發想到完成耗時5年，部分熟悉該部漫畫的人認為改編難度頗高，但是動畫工作室Studio 4℃不畏挑戰。雖然如此，漫長的籌資及製作過程讓製片田中榮子備感煎熬，所幸電影的完成度高，在業界立下新的里程碑。
田中榮子在吉卜力工作室當過《龍貓》和《魔女宅急便》的製片，期間認識了動畫師暨導演森林晃司。兩人意氣相投，於1986年共同成立Studio 4℃，創辦宗旨是製作非主流動畫作品，且提供自由的創作空間，內容涵蓋MV、電視動畫、遊戲CG和電影等。

她說：「 如果要做很美的影像，已經有宮崎駿了。因此我們的目標是集結各式影像創意人員，讓他們自由發揮，製作與主流不同的內容。」
公司成立至今推出不少叫好叫座的作品，包括由大友克洋和森本晃司合導的動畫片《回憶三部曲》，以及獲頒日本電影學院獎最佳動畫長片的《惡童當街》。目前Studio 4℃有40名員工，以製片和電腦動畫人員居多，原畫動畫師占比不大，多半與自由工作者合作。

In Ghibli, I worked as a producer for Totoro. She opened the company differently from Hayao Miyazaki.

The Japanese animated film ""The Son of the Sea Beast"" describes that the relationship between the flower and the mother is not good, and the school community is also excluded. She did nothing during the summer vacation, and occasionally met the brothers of ""sea"" and ""empty"" in the aquarium where her father worked. Under their guidance, the flowers came to the magical world that they had never seen before. ""The Son of the Sea Beast"" is currently on stage.



It took five years for the film to come out. Some people who are familiar with the comics think that the adaptation is quite difficult, but the animation studio Studio 4°C is not afraid of challenges. Despite this, the long process of fundraising and production has made the production of the film in the field of Rongzi, but fortunately the completion of the film is high, setting a new milestone in the industry.
In the Ghibli studio, Ryoko Tanaka became a producer of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""The Witch's Delivery Service"", and met the animator and director of the forest. The two were willing to invest in the studio. In 1986, Studio 4°C was established. The founding purpose was to create non-mainstream animation works and provide free creative space covering MV, TV animation, game CG and movies.


The animated film ""Reminiscence Trilogy"" by Dayou Keyang and Morimoto Koji is one of Studio 4°C's masterpieces. (Reflected from youtube_ love rock)

She said: ""If you want to make beautiful images, there is already Hayao Miyazaki. So our goal is to assemble a variety of image creative people, let them freely play and produce content that is different from the mainstream.""
Since its establishment, the company has launched a number of well-known works, including the animated film ""Reminiscence Trilogy"" by Dayou Keyang and Morimoto Koji, and ""The Evil Child Street"" which was awarded the best animated feature film of the Japan Film Academy Awards. At present, Studio 4 °C has 40 employees, mostly in production and computer animation. The original animators account for a small proportion, mostly working with freelancers.
