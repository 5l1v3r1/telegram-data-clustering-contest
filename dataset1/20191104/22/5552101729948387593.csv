【綠直搗韓營3】陸軍啟動　最怕支持者不投票讓韓國瑜爽當選
04 Nov 2019, 22:58 by 黃揚明, 賴智揚
雖然總統蔡英文民調穩定領先國民黨對手韓國瑜，但綠營不敢大意，積極布局陸戰拉抬支持者投票意願。



曾公開力挺蔡英文的知名團購達人「486先生」陳延昶，10月26日發文指出：「2020投票日當天韓粉投票率至少有95趴，英粉我估計可能只有6成5。最近得到很多消息我很多同學都會投韓，且他們開始表態與動員拉票」。這篇發文被超過5千位網友分享，顯示綠營危機意識發酵。


蔡英文全國競總將於十七日成立，內部雖在裝修中，但已看得到「2020台灣要贏」的競選口號。

蔡英文競辦發言人阮昭雄強調，組織戰一定會整合黨內所有資源，除了16日起成立的各縣市總部，立委候選人也會與蔡英文設聯合總部、議員則成立後援會相挺，採複式動員，讓支持者極大化。
除了各地競總、後援會組織外，蔡英文的陸軍還包括小英之友會系統主導的百工百業後援會，全國、地方已成立數百個獨立群組。
阮昭雄表示，這次較特別的是將全國後援會系統結合政府主推的重點政策，例如綠能產業、機車業、消防防災產業、電器業都是首次成立，透過更細緻的分眾族群，讓支持蔡英文的力量撐到最大。
