      <p>B.C.’s police watchdog is recommending criminal charges against three Kamloops RCMP officers.</p>
      <p>The Independent Investigations Office announced on Monday that it has forwarded a report to Crown prosecutors recommending assault charges for one Mountie and criminal driving charges relating to the alleged conduct of three officers.</p>
      <p>The investigation stems from an early-morning Dec. 8, 2018, collision between an unmarked police car and a stolen pickup truck.</p>

      <p>At the time, police told IIO investigators the truck had previously failed to stop.</p>
      <p>The truck’s driver was injured during the arrest. It will be up to Crown prosecutors to decide whether any charges will be laid.</p>
