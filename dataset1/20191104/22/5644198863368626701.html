      <p>Rafa Nadal dethroned Serbia's Novak Djokovic to reclaim the number one spot in the ATP rankings on Monday following the Spaniard's semi-final run at the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Rafa Nadal dethroned Serbia's Novak Djokovic to reclaim the number one spot in the ATP rankings on Monday following the Spaniard's semi-final run at the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>Nadal withdrew minutes before his semi-final match against Canada's Denis Shapovalov with an abdominal injury, with the 33-year-old deciding not to take any risks ahead of the Nov. 10-17 ATP Finals.</p>

      <p>Despite Djokovic winning the title in Paris, the semis run was enough for Nadal to become the second-oldest player to top the rankings after Swiss Roger Federer achieved the feat aged 36 in 2018.</p>
      <p>"I'm super happy with my season," Nadal said. "It was a tough beginning but then I was able to find a way to be back playing at a very high level of tennis and be in the situation that I am today.</p>
      <p>"I'm very proud about the year that I am having."</p>
      <p>Nadal won two Grand Slams this year - the French Open and the U.S. Open - to move within one of Federer's record of 20 titles.</p>
      <p>But injuries have curtailed Nadal's season and the ATP Finals will be his last chance to end the year as number one for the fifth time in his career.</p>
