      <h1>Dow closes at record high</h1>
      <h2>Hopes continue that US, China will reach agreement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:06:54+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Anneken Tappe, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - US stocks hit historic highs again on Monday. But this time the Dow joined the record-setting club as well.</p>
      <p>All three major stock indexes -- the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite -- finished at their highest level on record. Markets around the world were trading higher on hopes that the United States and China will reach a full trade agreement.</p>
      <p>The Dow closed up 0.4%, or 115 points, at 27,462 points, succeeding the record its set on July 15.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 finished 0.4% higher at 3,078 points, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% to 8,433 points. They both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/investing/sp-nasdaq-dow-stock-market-record/index.html">closed at all-time highs on Friday</a>. The S&amp;P set three records last week alone.</p>
      <p>Although there is little new on the trade front on Monday, last week's hopes for a US-China trade deal were buoyed again after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross expressed optimism over a deal in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/ross-optimistic-on-china-trade-deal-says-huawei-licenses-coming?srnd=premium">Bloomberg interview</a>. Ross also said that US companies selling parts to China's Huawei <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/business/huawei-license-wilbur-ross/index.html">would receive licenses to do so</a>.</p>
      <p>The two largest economies in the world agreed a "phase one" deal in October, and were meant to sign it at the APEC meeting in Chile. However, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/americas/chile-protests-apec-cop25-hosting-canceled-intl/index.html">Chile is no longer hosting</a>. President Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1189895935721197570?s=20">said in a tweet last week Thursday</a> that Beijing and Washington are working on finding a new place for the signing.</p>
