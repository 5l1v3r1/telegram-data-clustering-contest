高雄監獄的受刑人陳瑞卿因家暴、吸毒，遭法院判刑2年4個月，原本預計在12月就可出獄，不料卻意外死在獄中。
知情人士透露，陳瑞卿國中畢業後擔任機械組裝員，月薪高達8萬元，不料卻染上吸毒惡習，精神開始恍惚，生活也變了調。他後來失業、躲在家中喝酒，還常向家人討錢買毒，更經常毆打年邁的母親，就連姊姊及親生稚子也難逃毒手，陳甚至揚言要殺害所有家人再同歸於盡，前後幾十次的家暴、吸毒及竊盜犯行，讓家人多次聲請家暴令，希望能離他遠一點。

該人士說，陳瑞卿從9年前開始就會毆打母親，他不滿母親不給錢花用，竟當著社區警衛的面，抓著母親的身體撞牆，口裡還嚷著：「乎妳死！」後來陳母搬家並聲請保護令，某日陳敲門要求媽媽回家不成，又在屋外大嗆：「如果不給我錢，就要給妳死！」

陳母最終決定提告，法院審理時，陳瑞卿求饒且表明悔過，還跟母親及姊姊約法三章，並簽下和解書，同意四點承諾。包括：「一、我出獄後絕不再向家人索取金錢；二、出獄後我會找個正當工作，一個月薪資繳1萬5千元給媽媽；三、出獄後會盡心扶養兒子；四、以後如有再向家人惡力相向，願受法律裁決，絕無怨言。」陳母心軟，懇求法官輕判。
但沒多久後，陳瑞卿故態復萌，又向媽媽咆哮要錢買酒買毒，甚至因陳母不讓他帶走兒子，恫稱說：「只要讓我遇到兒子，就要帶他去跳海！」陳母擔心孫子出意外，急忙報警、聲請保護令。不料，陳發現母親報案後，居然跑到住在母親附近的姊姊家狂按對講機，並恫嚇：「報我家暴，害我被警察抓，要給你死！」搞到連姊姊也聲請保護令，陳最後被判決入獄服刑。
