Protestors Are Planning To Disrupt The Melbourne Cup

04 Nov 2019, 22:03

FIVEaa’s Stephen Rowe has slammed animal activists planning protests for Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup.
Rowey told David & Will on FIVEaa Breakfast:
“Animal activists may try and rail road the race. Fair dinkum, get a life you losers, is what I would say. They’re just professional activists aren’t they? Don’t they just save the whales and mining protests -- go get a job.”
Penbo wasn’t so sure…
PENBO: “I’m with you about not disrupting the race, but that footage the other night was full on… I don’t think it’s necessarily rent a crowd. I actually think this is a problem for the industry. There might have been a bit of a shift…”ROWEY “Yeah, probably a bit hard.”
