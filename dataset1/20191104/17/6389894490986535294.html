      <h1>TfL is investigating thousands of potentially illegal minicab drivers</h1>

      <p>Transport for London is investigating almost 2,000 London minicab drivers that may have illegally gained their driving qualifications.</p>
      <p>Minicab drivers must complete several requirements – passing topographical tests, medical checks and criminal record checks – with TfL before gaining a private hire vehicle licence.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the same qualifications can also be attained by completing a Business and Technology Education Council (Btec) diploma from private colleges and centres.</p>
      <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that an East London centre has been offering to pass students without doing any work for a £500 fee.</p>
      <p>Instructors from Vista Training Solutions in Newham were caught on camera giving out answers to tests and fraudulently awarding the diplomas.</p>
      <p>TfL said it was now investigating 1,667 people in light of the findings and would take swift action against anyone who had fraudulently obtained their qualifications.</p>
      <p>Helen Chapman, TfL’s director of licensing, regulation and charging, said only 3 per cent of minicab drivers gain their qualifications through Btec courses.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is deeply concerning to learn that some colleges or schools could be illegally providing certificates.</p>
      <p>“Given these allegations, we have put any applications on hold from those candidates who have not taken a topographical assessment in a TfL centre and we are now reviewing whether to remove this exemption in its entirety.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said this is “an extremely serious matter”.</p>
      <p>The investigation comes after <i>City A.M. </i>revealed last week that TfL had implemented stringent checks on Uber’s licensing procedures.</p>
      <p>This prompted suggestions that the ride hailing company has had problems with unlicensed drivers in the past, a charge Uber did not deny.</p>
      <p>The growth in ride hailing apps, like Uber, caused an 86 per cent increase in total private hire vehicle licences in circulation over the past eight years.</p>
      <p>General secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association Steve McNamara said he believed there was a problem in London with unlicensed private hire drivers.</p>

      <p>“The fact so many drivers have been able to operate private hire vehicles with illegally obtained licences raises serious questions for TfL,” he said.</p>
      <p>Vista said it was shocked about what had been happening and had sacked those caught on camera giving out diplomas fraudulently.</p>
