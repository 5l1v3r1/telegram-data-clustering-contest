      <h1>You can own a "DeLorean" hovercraft</h1>

      <p>This DIY hovercraft styled like the Doc Brown's DeLorean in the Back to the Future films is up for auction on Bring A Trailer. Current bid is $22,500, half of what maker Matt Riese was asking when I <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/11/15/delorean-hovercraft-for-sale.html">posted last year</a> that the DeLorean was listed on eBay. Apparently he's done quite a bit of work on it since. From <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/listing/delorean-dmc-12-hovercraft">Bring A Trailer</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The vehicle was constructed with plywood and fiberglass built over a styrofoam slab. The seller reports it is approximately the size of a DeLorean DMC-12, and the bodywork was recently repainted. Equipment includes gullwing doors, as well as working headlights and side markers. Dummy tail lamps flank the rear-mounted fan. <br/><br/>The seller reports that the vehicle is capable of 31 mph on water under ideal conditions, with speeds in the high twenties being more typical. Hovering in choppy water is not recommended.</blockquote>
