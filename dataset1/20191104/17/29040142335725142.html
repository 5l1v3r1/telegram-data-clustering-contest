      <p>Adobe may have just <a href="https://www.imore.com/photoshop-ipad-now-available-subscription-and-all">released</a> Photoshop this morning for the iPad, but it looks like it hasn't completely forgotten about Android users. In an <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-adobe-photoshop-camera/">announcement</a> posted via its blog today, Adobe showed off its new Photoshop Camera app coming in 2020 for iOS and Android devices.</p>

      <p>So, what exactly does Photoshop Camera do? According to Adobe, it will be able to apply filters and effects to your photos using Adobe Sensei Artificial Intelligence either before or after the photo is taken. Plus, it will be able to give you a live view of the filter or effect before snapping the photo while also saving an unmodified image in case you change your mind later.</p>
      <blockquote>Leveraging Adobe Sensei intelligence, the app can instantly recognize the subject in your photo and provide recommendations, and automatically apply sophisticated, unique features at the moment of capture (i.e. portraits, landscapes, selfies, food shots), while always preserving an original shot. It also understands the technical content (i.e. dynamic range, tonality, scene-type, face regions) of the photo and automatically applies complex adjustments.</blockquote>
      <p>The app will also include a "curated feed of lenses made by well-known artists and influencers", such as Billie Eilish. Not only will Photoshop Camera make it easy to take creative photos, but it'll also be easy to share with an option to post photos directly to Instagram from within the app. </p>
