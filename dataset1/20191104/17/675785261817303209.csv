Bonfire Night means many of us will be lighting up the skies over a warm hot chocolate and woolly hat.
And to mark November 5, many local parks will be hosting events to get us out to celebrate the autumn tradition.
But for those of you planning to host your very own display of lights, there are a few rules to follow.
In fact failing to stick to them could land you an on-the-spot £90 fine - which could jump to as high as £5,000.
And that's excluding any noise pollution complaints for displeased neighbours - which includes a letter, and at worst, an anti-social behaviour order along with civil action.

Firstly, you can’t buy 'adult' fireworks if you’re under 18.
It’s also against the law for anyone to set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am, except on certain occasions:

On Bonfire Night, adults are allowed to set off fireworks until midnight
On New Year's Eve, Diwali and the Chinese New Year, fireworks are allowed up until 1am

You must not set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am outside of the above events,
Always check with your council to find out about any local rules for setting off fireworks.
The safety rules you need to know about
If not used properly, fireworks can pose serious risks not just to children, but adults, too. Remember:

It is illegal to sell adult fireworks to anyone under the age of 18
It is illegal to have adult fireworks in a public place if you're under the age of 18
It is illegal to be in the possession of fireworks meant for a professional display
It's incredibly important that those purchasing fireworks only do so with items marked 'BS 7114:1988', form a reputable retailer.

As well as the above, it's worth remembering that all children should be supervised whilst handling fireworks and sparklers must only be handed to those aged five or above.
