      <p>MUMBAI: India's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> tie against Pakistan at Islamabad this month must be played at a neutral venue after the latest advice from the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Tennis-Federation">International Tennis Federation</a>'s independent security advisors, the world governing body said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Asia/Oceania Group I tie, originally scheduled for September 14-15 in Islamabad, was postponed by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ITF">ITF</a> to November 29-30 following a security review amid political tensions between the bitter neighbours.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/All-India-Tennis-Association">All India Tennis Association</a> had requested the ITF to shift the tie to a neutral venue.</p>
      <p>"Following a review of the latest advice given by the ITF's independent security advisors, the Davis Cup Committee has taken the decision that the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I tie between Pakistan and India on 29-30 November 2019, must be played at a neutral venue," the ITF said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The ITF and Davis Cup Committee's first priority has always been the safety of athletes, officials and spectators and the decision was made on this basis," it added.</p>
      <p>According to Davis Cup regulations, the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) now has five working days to choose and confirm their proposed venue.</p>
      <p>Pakistan was forced to host Davis Cup ties at neutral venues for more than a decade as teams refused to travel to the country citing security concerns.</p>
      <p>They played their first home tie after a gap of 12 years against Iran in 2017, while Hong Kong was relegated and fined by the ITF after they refused to travel to Pakistan the same year.</p>
