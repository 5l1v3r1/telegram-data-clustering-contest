Springbok pair set for shock switch to Munster
04 Nov 2019, 17:43 by Online Editors
World Cup winners Damian de Allende and RG Snyman are reportedly set to sign for Irish province Munster, in what represents a major double-signing for Johann van Graan’s side.
De Allende was a key performer for South Africa as they landed a third World Cup title, scoring tries against both Japan and Wales, while his defensive work was also a major factor in the Springboks’ success.
Snyman was mainly used as an impact player, but still made his presence felt in Japan.



There are plenty of links to Munster within the South Africa camp. Head coach Rassie Erasmus was in charge at Thomond Park before returning to his native South Africa, while former Munster player Felix Jones was praised for his contribution since joining as a coaching consultant.
Munster have been permitted to complete the signings by the IRFU, and both players are extended to sign two-year deals with the two-time European champions, according to the Irish Independent.
De Allende will play for Japan’s Panasonic Wild Knights for one season before making the switch to Munster next summer.
Similarly, Snyman will complete a season Honda Heat before joining the province.
