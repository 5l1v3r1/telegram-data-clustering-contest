      <h2>Arsenal splashed the cash on William Saliba this summer - but Real Madrid want to sign the youngster before he's even played a game for the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:14:32+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has reportedly not given up hope of signing young defender William Saliba - despite him putting pen to paper with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>The highly-rated French youngster was snapped up by the Gunners in a £27million deal in July before heading straight back to St Etienne on loan.</p>
      <p>After injury problems early in the season, he has put in a string of impressive displays leading to speculation he might never play for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Spanish outlet <a href="https://www.defensacentral.com/real_madrid/1572628565-exclusiva-dc-los-3-centrales-franceses-que-zidane-ha-pedido-seguir">Defensa Central</a> claim Zinedine Zidane still wants to sign Saliba, and has asked <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> club bosses to make a move to convince the Gunners to cash-in for a hefty profit.</p>

      <p>Zidane is determined to strengthen his defence and eyeing a long-term signing to become the next Raphael Varane.</p>
      <p>Saliba is one of three top targets, along with Benoit Badiashile and Boubacar Kamara as the Frenchman raids his homeland for talent.</p>
      <p>Monaco ace Badiashille and Marseille's Kamara are both viewed as future stars, as well as Arsenal's Saliba.</p>
      <p>Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel recently questioned the decision of his club to sell Saliba before his summer arrival as he hailed his ability and potential.</p>

      <p>Puel told L'Equipe: "It’s done, adopted and I’ve got nothing to say because it helped perform.</p>
      <p>"Saint-Etienne have held their rank these past few years. Finishing fourth is a great result. Work was done in the short-term.</p>
      <p>"Is this model viable? I don’t think it can make the club a success. Rather than buying a ready-made player, I’d rather we buy him to develop him and help him grow.</p>

      <p>"It’s hard to accept that we sell our best player, a young kid, to help fill the coffers.</p>
      <p>"When you have to sell your gems to round up the budget and then do short term deals to fill in the gaps, you’re being reactionary."</p>
      <p>Saliba recently impressed Arsenal bosses when back at their training ground to recover from a groin injury as he is tipped for big things when he permanently arrives in north London next summer.</p>
