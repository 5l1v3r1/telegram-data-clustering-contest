The first scientific session of the festival began with a presentation by Professor Charles Al-Elachi, the main speaker of the festival, and an honorary professor of electrical engineering and electrical sciences at California Institute of Technology, and a key researcher in a number of studies and aviation projects sponsored by NASA. In his presentation, he touched upon the latest techniques in space discovery. He said: “Among the planets we have discovered, is Saturn, which took us nearly 13 years to reach. It is composed of parts and a layer of snow and dust with 90 planets around it, including the planet Titan, which consists of a number of sand hills, lakes and rivers. Its atmosphere contains hydrocarbons, and is characterized by very low temperature, and a large proportion of oil. Its geological nature is similar to the nature of the planet Earth, but it depends on hydrocarbons, and there is a moon orbiting it.”During the first day of Oman Science Festival 2019, the Ministry of Education and PDO signed a Memorandum of Understanding to launch the second edition of the PDO Renewable Energy Award for School Students.
