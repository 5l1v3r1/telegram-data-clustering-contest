      <h1>EU argues against US metal tariffs at WTO</h1>

      <p>In a public hearing at the World Trade Organization, the European Union has launched a case against the United States over metal tariffs imposed in 2018.</p>
      <p>At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump determined that tariffs were necessary for national security reasons.</p>
      <p>It is the first of a series of cases brought to the Geneva-based trade body by countries hit by those measures.</p>
      <p>Due to the complexity of the issues, the Panel expects to issue its ruling no earlier than autumn 2020.</p>
      <p>The launch of the case against Washington comes at the time of looming U.S. tariffs on European cars.</p>
      <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross suggested that the government may “not need” to levy tariffs on imported cars after holding “good conversations” with automakers in the EU, Japan and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Negotiations with individual companies about their capital investment plans might bear enough fruit that tariffs become unnecessary, Ross said in an interview.</p>
      <p>In May, the White House agreed to delay new car tariffs for six months as Washington engaged in negotiations with the EU and Japan.</p>
      <p>While the U.S. struck a deal with Japan last month that averted the tariffs, the EU has yet to reach an agreement with the Trump administration.</p>
