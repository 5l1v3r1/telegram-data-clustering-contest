瑞安系又炒私有化 想贏大錢要有呢個準備｜吳家順

瑞安建業（00983）主要業務為物業發展投資、建築承建、樓宇翻新等都有，在香港的基建項目，有不少都是由瑞安承建。此外，內地房地產項目遍及成都、重慶、廣州、南京、瀋陽、天津等城市。

集團2019年上半年新簽建築承建合約20億元，手頭合約總值155億元，未完成合約共78億元。瑞安建業每股賬面資產淨值約7.5元，近來股價連環上升，執筆時為2.45元，較資產淨值折讓67.3%；最近在中期業績後，集團亦不斷回購，可以說是因為回購掃起股價。
瑞房較賬面值折讓近七成
瑞安房地產（00272）主要業務是發展內地地產項目，例如上海外灘地標之一的上海新天地。集團超過一半的商業資產位於上海，除上海新天地外，還有虹橋天地、瑞虹天地、創智天地、INNO創智、上海太平橋、上海瑞虹新城等，都是集中在商業零售，亦有住宅。瑞房每股賬面資產淨值約5元，以股價1.55元計，較資產淨值折讓69%。
投資者或者不知，香港的地產股絶大多數股價都是較資產有一定的折讓，就例如新鴻基地產（00016），每股資產淨值195元，股價118元，較淨值折讓39%。這種折讓情況比比皆是，原因之一，是控股結構、家族關係、間接持有等，相比較下風險系數提高，變相令到估值相應下降去平均風險等。
內房股的情況則比較兩極，例如越秀地產（00123）股價也較資產淨值折讓約40%，即是市賬率0.6倍；相反中國奧園（03883）股價就較其資產淨值高一倍，即市賬率2倍。
出現這樣分別的其中一個原因，是內房股的土地儲備一般較多，甚至其地產項目不少都已完成銷售，等待項目完成入賬便可，到時公司的資產負債表自然提升。除了是個別企業的原因，在某些股市的環境及經濟周期下，特別容易孕育私有化的條件。
試想像一下，在股價紛紛飛天的「大時代」，私有化的成本很高，股民亦不容易接受，因為等待股價繼續創新高。相反，當股災遍地屍骸之時，對大股東來說，理論上是最好私有化的時刻，因為成本最低；但小股東們同樣知道這個情況，所以一般也不容易接受私有化的條件。



要有長時間等待準備
那麼，在股價處於中間範圍，同時社會對未來經濟前景看淡之時，就是客觀條件都配合到的環境，即是現在。瑞安系一向予市場的印象，是就營運效益一般，因此其股價較資產淨值折讓的幅度也較其他房地產股為大。
就在2018年初，市場熱傳指瑞安已經尋求銀行的30億元融資，準備將瑞安房地產私有化，但據報道指當時因為消息外泄，計劃被迫終止。如今年半時間過去，可能又是投機者炒私有化蠢蠢欲動之時。但必須一提的是，炒私有化如果真的等到成事當然開心；但隨時也可以等一兩年也仍未等到，這點必須注意。

Ryan is also privatized and wants to win big money to have a preparation | Wu Jiashun
04 Nov 2019, 17:08 by Wu Jiashun Thomas
Shui On Construction (00983) is principally engaged in property development investment, building construction and building renovation. Many of the infrastructure projects in Hong Kong are undertaken by Shui On. In addition, mainland real estate projects are located in Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shenyang, Tianjin and other cities.
Written by: Wu Jiashun|Photo: China News Service, New Media Room
In the first half of 2019, the Group signed a new construction contract of RMB 2 billion, with a total contract value of RMB 15.5 billion and an uncompleted contract of RMB 7.8 billion. Shui On Construction’s net book value per share is about 7.5 yuan. Recently, the stock price has risen continuously. At the time of writing, it was 2.45 yuan, a 67.3% discount to the net asset value. Recently, after the interim results, the group also repurchased. It can be said that it is because of the repurchase sweep. Starting price.
Ruifang has a discount of nearly 70% to the book value
Shui On Land (00272) is principally engaged in the development of mainland real estate projects, such as Shanghai Xintiandi, one of Shanghai's landmarks. More than half of the Group's commercial assets are located in Shanghai. In addition to Shanghai Xintiandi, Hongqiao Tiandi, Ruihong Tiandi, Chuangzhi Tiandi, INNO Chuangzhi, Shanghai Taiping Bridge and Shanghai Ruihong New City are all concentrated in commercial retail. Residential. Ruifang's net book value per share is about 5 yuan, which is 69% off the net asset value based on the stock price of 1.55 yuan.
Investors may not know that most of Hong Kong's real estate stocks have a certain discount to assets. For example, Sun Hung Kai Properties (00016) has a net asset value of 195 yuan per share and a stock price of 118 yuan, a 39% discount to the net value. This kind of discount situation abounds. One of the reasons is the holding structure, family relationship, and indirect holding. Compared with the risk coefficient, the disguised form makes the valuation correspondingly lower and the average risk.
The situation of China property stocks is relatively high. For example, Yuexiu Property (00123) shares also traded at a discount of about 40% to the net asset value, which is a price-to-book ratio of 0.6 times. On the contrary, China Aoyuan (03883) shares are twice as high as their net asset value. , that is, the price-to-book ratio is 2 times.
One of the reasons for this difference is that the land reserve of the Chinese property stocks is generally more, and even many of its real estate projects have been completed, waiting for the project to be completed, and the company's balance sheet will naturally increase. In addition to the reasons of individual companies, in certain environmental and economic cycles of the stock market, it is particularly easy to breed conditions for privatization.
Imagine that in the ""big era"" where stock prices are flying, the cost of privatization is high, and investors are not easy to accept because they are waiting for stock prices to continue to hit new highs. On the contrary, when the stock market crashes everywhere, it is theoretically the best time for privatization for the major shareholders, because the cost is the lowest; but the small shareholders also know the situation, so it is generally not easy to accept the conditions of privatization.



Have a long wait for preparation
Then, when the stock price is in the middle range and the society is bleak for the future economic prospects, it is the environment in which the objective conditions are matched, that is, now. The impression that Shui On has always given the market is that its operating efficiency is average, so its share price is more discounted than the net asset value than other real estate stocks.
At the beginning of 2018, the market said that Ryan had sought the bank's 3 billion yuan financing to prepare for the privatization of Shui On Land, but it was reported that the plan was forced to terminate because of the news leak. If this year and a half have passed, it may be time for speculators to revive privatization. However, it must be mentioned that if the privatization of the speculation is really happy after the completion of the event, it can be waited for a year or two and it has not yet waited. This must be noted.
