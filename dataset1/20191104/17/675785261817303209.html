      <h2>Bonfire night is almost here, as is New Year's Eve and all of the festivities that follow this time of year. These are the rules to follow if you're taking part in the celebrations this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:22:20+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Bonfire Night means many of us will be lighting up the skies over a warm hot chocolate and woolly hat.</p>
      <p>And to mark November 5, many local parks will be hosting events to get us out to celebrate the autumn tradition.</p>
      <p>But for those of you planning to host your very own display of lights, there are a few rules to follow.</p>
      <p>In fact failing to stick to them could land you an on-the-spot £90 fine - which could jump to as high as £5,000.</p>
      <p>And that's excluding any noise pollution complaints for displeased neighbours - which includes a letter, and at worst, an anti-social behaviour order along with civil action.</p>
      <h3>Fireworks - the time limits for using them</h3>

      <p>Firstly, you can’t buy 'adult' fireworks if you’re under 18.</p>
      <p>It’s also against the law for anyone to set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am, except on certain occasions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On Bonfire Night, adults are allowed to set off fireworks until midnight</li>
        <li>On New Year's Eve, Diwali and the Chinese New Year, fireworks are allowed up until 1am</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You must not set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am outside of the above events,</p>
      <p>Always check with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council">your council</a> to find out about any local rules for setting off fireworks.</p>
      <h3>The safety rules you need to know about</h3>
      <p>If not used properly, fireworks can pose serious risks not just to children, but adults, too. Remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is illegal to sell adult fireworks to anyone under the age of 18</li>
        <li>It is illegal to have adult fireworks in a public place if you're under the age of 18</li>
        <li>It is illegal to be in the possession of fireworks meant for a professional display</li>
        <li>It's incredibly important that those purchasing fireworks only do so with items marked 'BS 7114:1988', form a reputable retailer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As well as the above, it's worth remembering that all children should be supervised whilst handling fireworks and sparklers must only be handed to those aged five or above.</p>

      <p>Adult fireworks are category 2 and 3 fireworks - they don’t include things like party poppers.</p>
      <p>Category 4 fireworks can only be used by professionals. The law says you must not set off or throw fireworks (including sparklers) in the street or other public places.</p>
      <p>You can only buy fireworks (including sparklers) from registered sellers for private use on these dates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>15 October to 10 November</li>
        <li>26 to 31 December</li>
        <li>3 days before Diwali and Chinese New Year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At other times you can only buy fireworks from licensed shops.</p>
      <h3>A £5,000 fine for breaking the rules</h3>
      <p>You can be fined up to the price of £5,000.</p>
      <p>If deemed serious, you could be imprisoned for up to six months for selling or using fireworks illegally.</p>
      <p>An on the spot fine can also be administered of £90.</p>
