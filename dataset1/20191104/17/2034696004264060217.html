      </p>
      <p>Martin Scorsese has revealed that he did not get involved in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/joker-review-a-melancholic-psychodrama-punctuated-by-splashes-of-shocking-violence"><i>Joker</i></a> for “personal reasons”.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro"><i>Irishman</i></a> director, who was previously <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-considered-directing-joker-after-early-role-as-producer-2555790">reported to have considered directing the movie</a> in its early stages, spoke about his involvement in a new interview.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question about whether he considered the DC movie a theme park in light of his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-doubles-down-comparison-marvel-movies-theme-parks-2556716">recent comments about Marvel movies</a>, Scorsese told the BBC: “I don’t know about that, and I know the film very well, and I know [director] Todd [Phillips] very well. My producer, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, produced it.</p>

      <p>“So it’s an interesting question, because I thought about it a lot in the past four years, the <i>Joker</i>, and I decided I didn’t have the time for it. And also it is influenced by… Todd told me, ‘Marty this is yours… I don’t know if I wanna….’ But anyway, personal reasons went and got involved.</p>
      <p>“But I know the script very well and it has real energy and incredible Joaquin [Phoenix]. A remarkable work. But for me, ultimately, I don’t know if I make the next step which is this character developing into a comic book character. It develops into an abstraction. That doesn’t mean its bad art, it could be. But it’s not for me. It’s different from the superhero films.”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Scorsese recent denied a report that claimed he saw <i>Joker</i> as a “potential directing vehicle”. A representative said that he was only interested in being a producer.</p>
      <p>Following the success of <i>Joker</i>, Phoenix has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jokers-joaquin-phoenix-reveals-if-a-sequel-could-be-on-the-cards-2564174">revealed whether he would star in a potential sequel</a>, saying: “I wouldn’t just do a sequel just because the first movie is successful, that’s ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>However, he added: “Long before the release or before we had any idea if it would be successful, we talked about sequels.”</p>
