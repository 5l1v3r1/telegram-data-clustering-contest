      <h1>Frank Lampard outlines Chelsea transfer plans if FIFA ban is upheld</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea have been banned from signing players for two windows but their appeal will he heard by CAS later this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:11:47+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard insists he will spend in January if Chelsea win their appeal against a FIFA transfer ban.</p>
      <p>The Blues' appeal will be heard by Court of Arbitration for Sport on November 20, having already serving half of a two-window ban.</p>
      <p>Lampard has enjoyed a fine start to life back at Stamford Bridge despite being unable to sign any new players, with a series of youngsters catching the eye.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager is ready to strengthen his squad, boasting a transfer kitty of around £150m.</p>
      <p>"Chelsea will always look to improve in transfer windows if we can - and if the players we might look at are better or we feel are adding to the squad," Lampard said ahead of the Champions League clash with Ajax.</p>

      <p>“I’m very interested in the appeal of course because it’s obviously going to affect potentially what we can do in January or not.</p>
      <p>“It is a little bit down my list because the matter in hand is Ajax tonight. I’m not going too far ahead with what happens.</p>
      <p>“Of course some players have come in and shown with their opportunities they’ve been given that they can do roles and play well. We are getting results at the moment.</p>
      <p>“But at the minute I’m very happy with what I’ve got so I suppose that’s why the fans are as well.”</p>

      <p>Chelsea have been linked with a host of players in recent weeks, including Wilfried Zaha, Timo Werner and Moussa Dembele.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and England left-back Ben Chilwell is also believed to be on their radar.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount is one of the players to capitalise on the transfer ban but he insists he is ready to fight for his place, if new faces arrive.</p>
      <p>"We’ve had to deal with that during our whole time at Chelsea," he said.</p>
      <p>“You come into a team, there’s players from different countries and you’ve got to work and show how good you are."</p>
