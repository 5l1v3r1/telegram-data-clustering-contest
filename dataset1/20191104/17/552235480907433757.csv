Councillor Peter Craig, chair of SLLC, said: “Our aim in all of the work we do is to ensure equality of opportunity and the chance for all of our residents to make use of, and enjoy, our facilities and events.
“Providing a signed panto performance in each of our venues is something we have been working towards and I am delighted that we are able to unveil the news in time for this year’s festive season.
“I hope that as many people as possible are able to take up this opportunity, and that it is, in fact, an added advantage we are able to roll out across our cultural timetables throughout the year.”
Janis McDonald, chief officer of deafscotland, added: “We support this move to increased accessibility for BSL users, their families and friends and we will encourage people to attend.
“We appreciate the effort made to ensure inclusion for people who are too often marginalised and excluded from family entertainment and other cultural opportunities on offer in communities across Scotland.”
