      <h1>Public loos to double up as sex cabins to 'improve' prostitutes' working conditions</h1>
      <h2>Authorities in Berlin, Germany, say the move will give prostitutes along the Kurfürstenstrasse street better working conditions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:20:26+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>Public toilets in Berlin will double as sex cabins for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prostitution">prostitutes</a> in a bid to improve their working conditions.</p>
      <p>But residents and politicians in the city have blasted the move as grotesque.</p>
      <p>Two cabins are to be installed in a trial along Kurfürstenstrasse, the city's largest street prostitution area.</p>
      <p>Each will have two doors to make it easier for prostitutes to leave if clients become abusive or violent.</p>
      <p>"We know they have two functions. But the second function doesn't have to be pointed out," said one official.</p>
      <p>But it is said prostitutes in the city are running out of secluded open-air spaces in which to work.</p>
      <p>Residents have recently complained house entrances, underground car parks and even their cellars are increasingly being used for sexual encounters.</p>

      <p>Michael Ruthenbeck, a member of a neighbourhood association, has called for Berlin to have an official red light district outside the city centre and away from residential areas.</p>
      <p>He said: "These [new] measures won't help residents at all."</p>
      <p>And local MP Marcel Luthe told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper: "The authorities in Berlin are merely organising crime instead of fighting human trafficking and forced prostitution."</p>
      <p>However, groups campaigning for prostitutes have largely welcomed the decision.</p>
      <p>But Olga, one of these groups, said it had hoped the cabins would be for sex only.</p>
      <p>It was concerned that the cabins would be cleaned only once a day and would not have alarm buttons.</p>
      <p>"We would have preferred cleaner and safer locations for the women," said Lonneke Schmidt-Bink, a member of the group.</p>
      <p>Prostitution is legal in Germany and was recognised as a profession in 2002, allowing workers to register for social insurance.</p>
      <p>Germany has an estimated 400,000 prostitutes. Most come from eastern European countries.</p>
