How to clean your dirty AirPods Pro and charging case
04 Nov 2019, 17:26 by Michael Potuck
AirPods Pro bring a new form factor that includes an in-ear design. With that comes new parts to keep clean, and you’ll likely see them become dirtier than AirPods since they’re worn inside your ears. Even after a short time, AirPods Pro can get gunked up. Read on for how to clean your AirPods Pro and charging case.
Many were hoping AirPods Pro would come in black as well as white, but they launched in just white. While white looks simple and sharp, it shows dirt and earwax more easily. There’s also the in-ear tips to deal with now, and Apple has updated its guide on cleaning AirPods Pro, including the ear tips. Read on below for all the details.
How to clean your dirty AirPods Pro and charging case

Handy items include: cotton swab, flosser pick, microfiber cloth, Blu Tack, isopropyl alcohol

AirPods Pro earbuds

Wipe down your AirPods Pro with a clean microfiber cloth
Slightly dampen your cloth with fresh water (or distilled) if needed
Make sure to let them totally try before putting them back in the charging case or in your ears
Remove some of the excess cotton from an end for a more precise cotton swab tool
Gently use a flosser pick to break up and remove tough-to-reach spots
Blue Tack is another great way to remove dirt and gunk from the black speaker grilles

AirPods Pro ear tips

Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth or a cotton swab to clean the outside
To thoroughly clean them, pull firmly on the silicone ear tips to remove them
Rinse them with fresh water (Apple says to skip the soap and other cleaners)
Dry them off with your clean cloth
Blue Tack can be used to clean the speaker grilles when you have the ear tips off
Push them back into place until you hear a click (make sure the oval shape is lined up)



AirPods Pro: How to use Ear Tip Fit Test and change tips


AirPods Pro charging case

Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth to wipe down your AirPods Pro charging case
If needed, slightly dampen your cloth with isopropyl alcohol
Make sure to keep liquid out of the charging port/contacts
Blue Tack is again a great way to remove dirt and gunk from the outside and inside of the charging case

If you end up with debris or build up down toward the charging contacts in your charging case, you could try a manual air blower before giving canned air a try. It’s best to refrain from sticking anything down toward the charging contacts to avoid damage. Head to your local Apple Store or AASP if you need more help than basic AirPods Pro cleaning.
