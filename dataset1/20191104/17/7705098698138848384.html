      <h1>Marvel Legends Age of Apocalypse Figure Wave Shapes up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:14:16+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Y. Thompson</a></address>
      <p>We knew, thanks to <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/hasbro">Hasbro</a>‘s San Diego Comic-Con reveals, that figures based on X-Man, Age of Apocalypse Wolverine/Weapon X, and Morph should appear next spring. Now, thanks to reveals from Lucca, Italy, and Barcelona, Spain, we know a whole <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/x-men">X-Men</a> <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/age-of-apocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a> figure wave is coming. The popular 1995 comics event is back in fans’ minds again thanks to Fox’s <b>Legion</b> giving the inciting character the spotlight again.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sunfire’s translucent body and dark shading make him an instant must-have. And where would Wolverine be without Jean Grey?</p>

      <p>Wild Child appears to utilize a new, much smaller body. It’s creepy and weird with that oversized, white-eyed head, as it should be.</p>

      <p>Finally, Dark Beast tries to pull off the metallic pants look. Nobody tell him they don’t really complement his skin tone.</p>

      <p>All that remains is for the Build-a-Figure to be announced. Crazy spitballing guess here, but maybe, just maybe, it’ll be…Apocalypse. Unless they plan on stretching this theme out into more waves and saving him for later.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But a non-mutant figure showed his (masked) face too, and it’s Crossbones — a comic-book version. Based on the fact that we’ve already seen<a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/470291-marvel-build-a-figures-and-more-revealed-at-european-comic-conventions"> a new comic-based Bucky/Winter Soldier,</a> this could hint at a future Captain America wave. Unless, as we speculated before, they’re the token non-movie entries in a <b>Black Widow</b> wave. Both have appeared onscreen with Natasha, after all.</p>
