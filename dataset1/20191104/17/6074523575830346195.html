      <h1>DX.Exchange Halts Operations, Seeks Buyer 10 Months After Launch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:00:55+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">William Foxley</a></address>
      <p>DX.Exchange is hitting pause as it seeks a new owner.</p>
      <p>The firm, which offered tokenized shares in companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, announced the move <a href="https://blog.dx.exchange/2019/11/03/6595/">following a vote</a> by its board on Monday to discontinue operations as it pursues “a merger or outright sell of the company.”</p>
      <p>Should a buyer not be found, “the exchange may not resume operations,” the company wrote. Deposits have been suspended and customers have until Nov. 15 to withdraw funds.</p>
      <p>“The costs of providing the required level of security, support and technology is not economically feasible on our own,” the firm said in the announcement.</p>
      <p>During its January 2019 launch, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nasdaq-powered-security-token-exchange-will-launch-next-week">customers could buy tokenized</a> shares in Google parent company Alphabet, Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix, Baidu, Intel Corporation and Nvidia.</p>
      <p>DX.Exchange’s temporary closure comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/circle-to-spin-out-poloniex-exchange-less-than-2-years-after-400-million-takeover">Circle’s spin-off of Poloniex</a> two years after the fintech firm purchased the exchange for $400 million. Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville said they plan on shifting focus towards its USDC stablecoin and SeedInvest crowdfunding platform. An undisclosed Asia-based investment group, Polo Digital Assets, Ltd., purchased the exchange.</p>
