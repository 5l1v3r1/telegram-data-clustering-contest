      <p>LONDON (Nov 4): British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a seven percentage-point lead over the opposition Labour Party ahead of a Dec. 12 election, according to an ICM poll published by<i> Reuters</i> on Monday.</p>
      <p>ICM's first poll of the election campaign put the Conservatives on 38% and Labour on 31%. The pro-European Union Liberal Democrats had the support of 15% of those surveyed, while the Brexit Party was on 9%.</p>
      <p>The poll of 2,047 people, carried out online between Nov 1 and Nov 4, shows a narrower gap than recent surveys from other pollsters, which have put the Conservatives between 8 and 17 percentage points ahead of Labour.</p>
      <p>ICM said the survey showed the two main parties losing a similar proportion of voters over Brexit.</p>
      <p>It said 11% of those voted Conservative at the last election in 2017 were now planning to vote for the Brexit Party, while 12% of those who backed Labour in 2017 intended to vote for the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>More than two-thirds of those who voted 'Remain' in the Brexit referendum in 2016 and for the Conservatives in 2017 intended to stick with Johnson's Conservatives, ICM said.</p>
