04 Nov 2019, 17:50 by Ahmed Abba

French Defense Minister Florence Parly is visiting the Sahel region as terrorists continue to kill soldiers in Mali, Burkina Faso and the Niger Republic. During the first visit, the minister said. Parly said it would take a long time before terrorist activities in the Sahel are abolished.


""This is a war that we already know will take a long time, and it is very difficult. We are seeking the cooperation of countries like Chad because of their importance in this journey. I had the opportunity to speak with our G5-Sahel counterparts to do the same. look at how much progress has been made ”.


Parly's wife gives an example:


""If, for example, in the northern part of the Sahel region, in recent days we have reached a point where we have managed to find and seize weapons, this is one of our successes.""


Florence Parly underscores the importance of working with African countries in the fight against terrorism:


""In our meeting with President Idris Deby, I explained to him the importance of continuing to work together at the same time as the G5-Sshel army was about to begin a full-time operation under General Namata's command.""
