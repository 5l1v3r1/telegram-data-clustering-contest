      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:48:18+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Holly Willoughby was left squealing with joy after she discovered that she has a cameo role in Jennifer Aniston's new TV show.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter, 38, appears in the background of Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, which is based on an American news show similar to ITV's This Morning.</p>
      <p>Alongside Dr Chris Steele, Holly pops up during a scene involving Jennifer's character, news anchor Alex Levy, arguing with producers.</p>
      <p>Holly introduced a clip of the moment on This Morning today, saying: "Shall we have a look at it? Let's look at us!"</p>
      <p>After watching it, she said: "There you go, blink and you miss it!"</p>

      <p>Viewers of The Morning Show had been quick to tweet about Holly's brief appearance in the show.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Just spotted @hollywills and @Schofe on @thismorning in the background of Episode 3 of @AppleTV ’s #TheMorningShow​... they clearly know where the best one in the world is!"</p>
      <p>"Loved seeing @hollywills &amp; @Schofe on @TheMorningShow," another posted, alongside a laughing emoji.</p>

      <p>A third said: "Is that @DrChrisSteele &amp; the @thismorning set on the screen in the background of new The Morning Show?!"</p>
      <p>Jennifer and her co-star Reese Witherspoon were on This Morning today promoting their similarly named show, speaking to Alison Hammond.</p>
      <p>Alison, who knows a lot about daytime TV, gave the Hollywood actresses some pointers and asked whether they had done any research into her role.</p>

      <p>Jennifer said: "You especially. This is how good I am. You didn’t notice the following I did of you. That's how much of a shadow I am."</p>
      <p>The actresses then watched some classic This Morning clips and had to decide whether they were fake or not, which led to Jen swearing.</p>
      <p>They refused to believe that This Morning would air a knife thrower's assistant being hit in the head during a stunt.</p>
