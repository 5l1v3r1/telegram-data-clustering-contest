12 Hacks From the Past That Are Still Useful Today

04 Nov 2019, 17:30

Our grandparents were real superheroes. They knew how to tackle everyday problems like predicting the weather and dealing with household chores without needing modern technology or looking on the Internet for answers. While younger generations may be quite skeptical about the methods people used in the past, some of the hacks are so ingenious that they can give us a headstart to many modern techniques.
Bright Side found 12 simple yet effective life hacks that were passed down from generation to generation that can simplify our lives and save precious time. And we’d love to share this knowledge with you!

If something has gotten into your eye and you can’t remove it, there’s a simple remedy to ease the pain and remove the particle. All you need is castor oil and a paintbrush with a pointed end. Apply some oil to the brush and drop castor oil into the corner of your eye (please discuss the remedy with your ophthalmologist and use the castor oil that they recommend). Be careful — the drop should fall out itself, so don’t stick the brush into your eye!

Splinters can be really painful and hard to get rid of but there’s an old trick to extract them without any discomfort. Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour hot water into it. The water should cover the brim. Gently press the bottle to the affected area. It’ll create a vacuum effect that will pull down the flesh and hot steam will help remove the splinter.

Picking up pieces of broken glass with a vacuum cleaner is the quickest but not always the most effective method for cleaning up messes. Our grandmothers would suggest using a soft, damp cloth. It helps pick up even the smallest pieces and you can just throw the cloth away after using it, minimizing the chances of cutting yourself with the glass.


If you find a stain on your favorite mug, there’s a way to remove it without using any chemicals. Take a lemon peel, put some salt on it, and rub the stain out with it until it disappears. Salt acts as a gentle exfoliator while the lemon helps get rid of grease and adds a nice smell.

Freshly baked bread smells and tastes delicious but it can be a real challenge to cut it into thin slices. Luckily, there’s a quick and simple way to solve this problem. Put a knife in hot water to warm up the blade and then quickly wipe it dry and slice the loaf of bread with it. Repeat again if the knife has cooled down.

If you need to boil an egg but notice that it’s slightly cracked, there’s a sure way to prevent its contents from boiling out. Just add some vinegar to the water and cook the egg as usual. This method not only preserves cracked eggs, but it also makes peeling them much easier.

Some colorful pieces of clothing may lose their colors and fade after washing. To prevent this from happening, take a cup of salt and dissolve it in 1 gallon of water. Let your clothes soak in this solution overnight, then wash your clothes as usual. Salt sets the color into the fabric and stops dye from bleeding.

If your leather shoes are squeaky, try oiling them. Remove the insoles and apply a thin layer of coconut oil inside your shoes. Let the leather soak up the oil and put the insoles back. If the sound comes from your insole, take it out and put some baby powder inside your shoes.

If you’re going camping or just taking a walk early in the morning, you can easily predict the weather for the day. Look at the sky and find the most distant, tiny cloud. Then watch it for some time: if you notice that the cloud becomes larger, the day is likely to be cloudy and rainy. But if the cloud becomes gradually smaller, the day will probably be a sunny one.

If you get lost and your phone dies, you can easily tell the cardinal directions with the help of your watch. Take it off, place it horizontally and point the hour hand at the sun. The point in the middle of an imaginary line from the twelve o’clock and the hour hand shows the direction to the south. For example, if it’s 8 o’clock, the south will be at the 10 o’clock position.

If you have to transport cut flowers but you don’t have any special device on hand to keep them fresh, try this simple trick. Take a raw potato, make a small hole, and insert the end of the flower stalk into it. This way, flowers won’t fade away too quickly and can be preserved for up to a week or even more.


If despite all the precautions the cut flowers fade anyway, don’t worry, there’s a way to revive them. Just take a vase with hot water and put the stems in it. Wait until the water cools down. Then cut off the ends of the stems and put them in cold water. It’ll make the flowers look more alive and fresh.
