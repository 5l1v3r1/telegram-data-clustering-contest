Voyager 2: the story of its mission so far – in pictures

04 Nov 2019, 17:10

Since launching in 1977, the Nasa probe has captured never-before-seen images of the solar system


Nasa’s Voyager 2 sends back its first message from interstellar space





An illustration from 1965 shows the calculated trajectories of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. Launched 16 days apart, the two probes were designed to take advantage of a rare alignment of the outer planets that occurs once every 176 years. Their trajectories have taken them by the outer planets, where they have captured never-before-seen images. Jupiter and Saturn gave them a ‘gravity assist’, boosting their velocity. Though both spacecraft were destined for interstellar space, they followed slightly different trajectories

In 1973, the mission was named Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 1977 and was intended to go only as far as Jupiter and Saturn, as seen in the old mission logo. In March 1977 the mission name was changed to Voyager. In October 1978, a fact sheet mentioned the possibility of sending Voyager 2 to Uranus and Neptune. Voyager engineers had (unofficially) designed and built the spacecraft to be capable of navigating to Uranus and Neptune. Onboard computers were reprogrammed during the voyage, giving the spacecraft the ability to successfully return many more images and much more information than was expected

As the two Voyagers travel into deep space, they carry a small US flag and a golden record packed with pictures and sounds – mementoes of Earth. This picture shows John Casani, the Voyager project manager in August 1977, holding a small flag that was folded and sewed into the Voyagers’ thermal blankets before launch

Pioneers 10 and 11, which preceded Voyager, both carried small metal plaques identifying their time and place of origin for the benefit of spacefarers that might find them. With this example before them, Nasa placed a more ambitious message aboard Voyagers 1 and 2, a kind of time capsule intended to communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials. The Voyager message is carried by a phonograph record, a 12in gold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. It carries extraterrestrial instructions for playing it

This photograph of the southern hemisphere of Jupiter was obtained by Voyager 2 on 25 June 1979, at a distance of 8m miles (12m km). Seen in front of the turbulent clouds of the planet is Io, the innermost of the large Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Io is the size of our moon
Photograph: JPL/Nasa



The first close look ever obtained of Jupiter’s satellite Europa was taken on 9 July 1979 as the spacecraft approached the planet. This picture was made at a range of 152,000 miles. The complicated linear features appear even more like cracks or huge fractures in these images. Also seen are somewhat darker mottled regions which appear to have a slightly pitted appearance, perhaps due to small-scale craters

Voyager 2 approach Saturn in August 1981. This enhanced-colour picture shows the planet, its rings and four of its icy satellites. Three satellites (Tethys, Dione and Rhea) are visible against the darkness of space, and another smaller satellite (Mimas) is visible against Saturn’s cloud tops near the left horizon and just below the rings. This image was synthesised from images taken in Voyager’s orange, blue, and ultraviolet filters and was processed to create an exaggerated false colour

Possible variations in chemical composition from one part of Saturn’s ring system to another are visible in this Voyager 2 picture. This highly enhanced colour view was assembled from clear, orange and ultraviolet frames obtained on 17 August 1981 from a distance of 5.5m miles

This picture of Neptune was produced from the last whole planet images taken through the green and orange filters on Voyager 2’s narrow-angle camera. It shows the ‘Great Dark Spot’ and its companion bright smudge; on the west limb the fast-moving bright feature called Scooter and the little dark spot are visible

Another image of Neptune was reconstructed from two images taken by the narrow-angle camera, through the green and clear filters

Triton is by far the largest of Neptune’s moons and is one of only three objects in the solar system known to have a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere (the others are Earth and Saturn’s giant moon, Titan). The bluish-green band visible in this image extends all the way around Triton near the equator; it may consist of relatively fresh nitrogen frost deposits
