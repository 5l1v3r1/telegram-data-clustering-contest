      <p>ELECTED members of Mayo County Council are up in arms over a decision to cut the discretionary general municipal allocation (GMA) by over 50% on last year's figure.</p>
      <p>Documentation circulated ahead of the forthcoming budget meeting shows the amount reduced from €2.1 million to €1.05 million for 2020.</p>
      <p>The sums set aside for each of the four districts are as follows.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ballina €210,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Castlebar €245,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Claremorris/Swinford €350,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Westport €245,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The issue is due to be raised at meeting of the Castlebar and Claremorris municipal districts on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p><i>The Connaught Telegraph</i> has learned that councillors in Castlebar will be strongly opposing the proposal.</p>
      <p>They believe the figure has been reduced so radicially as a result of elected members failing to agree an increase to property tax back in September.</p>
      <p>The episode led to a major fall-out within Fianna Fáil when five members indicated their willingness to seek a special meeting of the council to increase the tax despite a clear indication by the council cathaoirleach, Councillor Brendan Mulroy, that he was against any increase in tax.</p>
      <p>But the five backed down following internal party opposition to the move.</p>
      <p>Now it will be interesting to see how the five councillors – Al McDonnell, Martin McLoughlin, Michael Smyth, Paul McNamara and Damian Ryan – will vote when the matter of the GMA decrease comes before their respective municipal district meetings.</p>
