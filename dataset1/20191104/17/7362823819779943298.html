      <h1>Andy Puzder: Even 'SNL' knows Warren's 'Medicare-for-all' plan would be 'devastating'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:54:44+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Nelson</a></address>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live">“Saturday Night Live”</a> mocked <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s</a> $52 trillion “Medicare-for-all" plan, former CEO of CKE Restaurants Andy Puzder said that the presidential hopeful has no understanding of how interrelated the economy is.</p>
      <p>“Her plan is ridiculous, it’s a fantasy, it’s unachievable, you couldn’t pass it. If you did pass it, it would tank the economy, it’s absurd,” Puzder, the author of “Capitalist Comeback,” told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">“Fox &amp; Friends”</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>There’s so much about this plan that would be so devastating for the American people and I think people are smart enough to know that. The 'Saturday Night Live' people certainly are.”</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Asked why it took her so long to release her health care plan, "SNL" star Kate McKinnon – playing Warren – answered, “When Bernie [Sanders] was talking 'Medicare-for-all,' everybody was like, ‘Oh cool,’ and then they turned to me and said, ‘Fix it, Mom.’”</p>
      <p>The fictional Warren added that her plan “compares favorably” to former Vice President Joe Biden’s “in that it exists.”</p>
      <p>She then answered a question about estimates of how much her plan would cost.</p>
      <p>“We’re talking trillions,” McKinnon answered. “When the numbers are this big they’re just pretend.”</p>

      <p>"Fox &amp; Friends" host Steve Doocy reported that independent estimates show that Warren’s plan could result in the loss of 2 million jobs in the private health care insurance industry.</p>
      <p>“Destroying those 2 million jobs destroys a lot more than just those 2 million,” Puzder responded.</p>
      <p>Warren has surged in polls recently as Biden has faded and she is in the lead in a new Iowa poll.</p>
