        <li>1.[+7,163, -401] I'm a fan but I don't want to shield him. Jung Kook-ah..I hope you're careful in the future.</li>
        <li>2. [+4,304, -1,284] When I first started driving I made a lot of mistakes too without knowing I was breaking traffic laws but a lot of people are out to get BTS right now so please be more careful...the standards are much higher for you guys now..</li>
        <li>3. [+3,064, -151] I thought that's what happened. Both of you got bruises so please get treated well so that there are no after effects.</li>
        <li>4. [+2,758, -313] I'm not a fan of BTS. I'm an ahjussi who doesn't even know the members names but a common traffic accident like this is bound to happen to anyone. He admitted the mistake and settled with the victim well so it shouldn't be an issue.</li>
        <li>5. [+2,221, -211] Let's be careful driving out there BTS...if you do something wrong for a moment it's amplified for you guys now.</li>
        <li>6. [+824, -141] It looks like it was a speeding violation or traffic lights...to be honest this happens to everyone, am I wrong? Of course I'm not saying he did well or anything but it's not something he should be getting hate for ㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>7. [+974, -432] Thank God it wasn't a drunk driving accident and no one was hurt...he already settled with the victim but all the articles are all "booked by police" fanning the flames..</li>
        <li>8. [+84, -39] It's a small fender bender. No big deal...Did he kill anyone? No. It was a simple traffic violation just stop.</li>
        <li>9. [+82, -12] What he did was wrong. He needs to take some time and reflect...Army need to stop shielding him and stay quiet~</li>
        <li>10. [+47, -5] This is not the time to cause controversy...Jung Kook-ah I hope you'll be a bit more careful in the future..</li>
      </ol>
