      <p>LONDON: Everton midfielder Andre Gomes is expected to make a “full recovery” after undergoing surgery to repair a fracture dislocation of his ankle, the Premier League club said on Monday.<br/>The Portugal international suffered the shocking injury when he fell awkwardly following a challenge from Tottenham’s Son Heung-min in Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Goodison Park.<br/>“Everton Football Club can confirm Andre Gomes underwent surgery to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle earlier today and the procedure went extremely well,” a club statement said.<br/>It added: “The 26-year-old is expected to make a full recovery.”<br/>Tottenham’s players were also affected by the incident, with Son — who was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson for his challenge — in tears and Serge Aurier, who collided with Gomes, substituted.<br/>The Premier League said in a statement that Son’s red card was for “endangering the safety of a player,” but Spurs are expected to lodge an appeal against Atkinson’s decision.<br/>Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino felt the injury led to an over-reaction.<br/>“It was clear it was never the intention of Son to create the problem that happened afterwards. It is unbelievable to see a red card,” said the Spurs boss.<br/>“We all feel sorry for Andre. I want to send my best wishes to him and to his family in this tough moment. We want to send, on behalf of the squad, our best wishes.”<br/>Though Everton canceled out Dele Alli’s opening goal with a Cenk Tosun header deep into the 12 minutes of time added on following Gomes’ injury, there was little sense of celebration at full-time.<br/>Everton defender Mason Holgate said he and his teammates felt like they owed it to Gomes to get a result, but the draw still felt like a defeat.<br/>“It is hard when something like that happens to get going again but we showed fight and went again,” Holgate said.<br/>“But it shows what we are about as a team. We got together and I think it drove us on a bit more once we got going, trying to do it for him.<br/>“It was really flat (in the dressing room). It was like we had been beaten.”</p>
