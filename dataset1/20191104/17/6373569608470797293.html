      <p>A woman has called for fireworks to be banned after her <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/pets">pet </a>rabbit was filmed shaking violently before it died after being literally scared to death.</p>
      <p>Donna Pilgrim said her beloved one-year-old bunny Archie was spooked and went into shock due to the loud bangs from a nearby firework display.</p>
      <p>She was told by vets to try keep him warm and quiet but she said he laid on his side and wouldn't stop shaking.</p>
      <p>Heartbroken Donna, 60, then revealed that he had literally been scared to death the next morning.</p>
      <p>Donna, of Millbrook, Cornwall, said: "Sadly my sweet little Archie is no longer with us.</p>
      <p>"I am so upset but so dam angry too. He was happily eating his supper at 5.30pm, then the fireworks started. It was the 3rd of November not the 5th.</p>

      <p>"He let out a squeal and laid on his side and wouldn't stop shaking.</p>
      <p>"Veterinary advice was to keep him warm and quiet, and all you could do was hope for the best. It was a shock reaction."</p>
      <p>Donna posted a video of Archie's reaction on Facebook before he died alongside a warning.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "My poor little man. He's just had a huge amount of fireworks go off outside.</p>
      <p>"As you can see, although he's snug with his hay and his little house where he usually lays. He's now just trembling and shaking in his bed.</p>
      <p>"This is the cruelty and reality of fireworks. I'm just hoping and praying that he's still with me tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"I found him lying on his side and shaking. He's obviously traumatised by it all.</p>
      <p>"So for that few quid's worth going up in smoke, that could do so much more, for so many animals or people in need.</p>
      <p>"I hope you enjoyed your five minutes of fun. I think I'll be very lucky to have Archie in the morning."</p>

      <p>Donna then revealed to her followers that Archie had died just over 12 hours later.</p>
      <p>She added: "I hope the money you spent for a few seconds of horrible noise was worth it.</p>
      <p>"Let's keep fighting to get Fireworks banned for the welfare of all animals, pets and wildlife.</p>
      <p>"It's heart breaking when they die. R.I.P Archie."</p>
