House GOP Campaign Arm Uses The Tech Firm At Center Of Trump’s 2016 Conspiracy Theory

04 Nov 2019, 17:09

FEC filings reveal that the House GOP’s official electoral committee uses Crowdstrike, the cybersecurity tech firm at the center of President Donald Trump’s unfounded conspiracy theory about the DNC and 2016 election meddling.
The filings, first flagged by the Washington Post on Monday, show that the National Republican Congressional Committee paid Crowdstrike $40,000 in June.
Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have peddled a baseless conspiracy theory alleging that the DNC colluded with Crowdstrike to manufacture fake evidence of the DNC email hack in 2016.
It was this conspiracy theory that led to Trump and Giuliani launching an operation to pressure Ukraine into investigating Crowdstrike, along with Joe Biden and his son Hunter, in exchange for congressionally-approved military aid and a White House meeting.
The scheme triggered the House impeachment investigation after a whistleblower flagged Trump’s infamous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked Zelensky to do him a “favor” and look into Crowdstrike.
The NRCC did not immediately respond to request for comment.
