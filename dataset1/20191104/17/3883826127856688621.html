        <b>The estranged wife of a wealthy farmer has been found guilty of murdering him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Angela Taylor and her partner Paul Cannon shared "a venomous hatred" for William Taylor as he would not divorce her, St Albans Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old's skeletal remains were found waist-deep in mud by a passing fisherman near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in February, eight months after he was reported missing.</p>
      <p>Taylor and Cannon were both convicted of murder and arson.</p>
      <p>The pair will be sentenced on Friday and Judge Michael Kay QC told them: "There is only once sentence that can be passed and it will be a life sentence."</p>
      <p>Gwyn Griffiths, 60 who was a colleague of Mr Cannon and from Folkestone, Kent, was cleared of conspiracy to murder.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor was reported missing by his lodger on 4 June 2018. Several days before he went missing his Land Rover was set on fire.</p>
      <p>DNA found in the torched car matched that of Cannon.</p>

      <p>Taylor, 53, and Cannon, 54, fantasised about killing Mr Taylor, who was known as Bill, in explicit messages sent to each other on WhatsApp, their trial heard.</p>
      <p>Messages read in court spoke about "the best way" to kill the farmer and hurt his family. They included references to pickaxes, chainsaws and barbed wire.</p>
      <p>Various scenarios were discussed in the messages and Taylor described them as "a turn-on".</p>
      <p>On the night Mr Taylor disappeared, Cannon sent a message which said: "Just watching Kill Bill 2 lol."</p>
      <p>Mr Cannon told police officers: "Messages between Angela and me related to no more than fantasy and banter of an extreme nature."</p>
      <p>Angela Taylor said she had sent the messages "out of frustration" as Mr Taylor was "getting on her nerves".</p>
      <p>Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Price QC said: "It will become apparent that he and she shared and encouraged in each other in a venomous hatred for William Taylor. They loathed him."</p>

      <p>Experts told the court that it was impossible to determine a cause of death because Mr Taylor's body was so badly decomposed.</p>
      <p>The farmer was still wearing his boots and blue overalls when his remains were found.</p>
      <p>The defence argued Mr Taylor probably died after getting "stuck in mud" and might have gone to the area for a picnic.</p>
      <p>Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there was no sign of blunt force injuries, no gunshot or stab wounds and no evidence of toxic substances.</p>
      <p>But the court heard there was a "possible fracture" to the hyoid bone in the neck, which could have been due to compression.</p>
