        <b>A red panda that escaped from a wildlife park on the Isle of Man has been recaptured after being spotted up a tree in a garden.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Kush" went missing from Curraghs Wildlife Park <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-50097428">three weeks ago</a>, after a tree fell across his enclosure.</p>
      <p>The panda is now being checked over in the park's hospital unit before being returned to its home.</p>
      <p>General manager Kathleen Graham said staff were "really relieved" the search had ended positively.</p>
      <p>A live trap had been set and a drone was also used to locate the animal, which was eventually spotted in the garden of a home about a mile away in Tholt-y-Will, Sulby.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old mammal "might have lost a bit of weight" but otherwise "looks quite healthy," Mrs Graham said.</p>
      <p>It took staff "about an hour" to capture the animal with a net before he was taken back to the park in a box.</p>
      <p>Since the escape, tree branches that looked in danger of breaking in the red panda enclosure had been removed, Mrs Graham said.</p>
