      <h1>How to clean your dirty AirPods Pro and charging case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:26:44+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/airpods/">AirPods Pro</a> bring a new form factor that includes an in-ear design. With that comes new parts to keep clean, and you’ll likely see them become dirtier than AirPods since they’re worn inside your ears. Even after a short time, AirPods Pro can get gunked up. Read on for how to clean your AirPods Pro and charging case.</p>
      <p>Many were hoping <a href="https://amzn.to/2CdFXYx">AirPods Pro</a> would come in black as well as white, but they launched in just white. While white looks simple and sharp, it shows dirt and earwax more easily. There’s also the in-ear tips to deal with now, and Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208729">updated its guide</a> on cleaning AirPods Pro, including the ear tips. Read on below for all the details.</p>
      <h3>How to clean your dirty AirPods Pro and charging case</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Handy items include: cotton swab, <a href="https://amzn.to/2JyvyJo">flosser pick</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2C95pOM">microfiber cloth</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2EryOlR">Blu Tack</a>, isopropyl alcohol</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>AirPods Pro earbuds</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Wipe down your AirPods Pro with a clean microfiber cloth</li>
        <li>Slightly dampen your cloth with fresh water (or distilled) if needed</li>
        <li>Make sure to let them totally try before putting them back in the charging case or in your ears</li>
        <li>Remove some of the excess cotton from an end for a more precise cotton swab tool</li>
        <li>Gently use a flosser pick to break up and remove tough-to-reach spots</li>
        <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2EryOlR">Blue Tack</a> is another great way to remove dirt and gunk from the black speaker grilles</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>AirPods Pro ear tips</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth or a cotton swab to clean the outside</li>
        <li>To thoroughly clean them, pull firmly on the silicone ear tips to remove them</li>
        <li>Rinse them with fresh water (Apple says to skip the soap and other cleaners)</li>
        <li>Dry them off with your clean cloth</li>
        <li>Blue Tack can be used to clean the speaker grilles when you have the ear tips off</li>
        <li>Push them back into place until you hear a click (make sure the oval shape is lined up)</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>AirPods Pro charging case</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a dry, clean microfiber cloth to wipe down your AirPods Pro charging case</li>
        <li>If needed, slightly dampen your cloth with isopropyl alcohol</li>
        <li>Make sure to keep liquid out of the charging port/contacts</li>
        <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2EryOlR">Blue Tack</a> is again a great way to remove dirt and gunk from the outside and inside of the charging case</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you end up with debris or build up down toward the charging contacts in your charging case, you could <a href="https://amzn.to/2NATazQ">try a manual air blower</a> before <a href="https://amzn.to/36y94ni">giving canned air a try</a>. It’s best to refrain from sticking anything down toward the charging contacts to avoid damage. Head to your local Apple Store or AASP if you need more help than basic AirPods Pro cleaning.</p>
