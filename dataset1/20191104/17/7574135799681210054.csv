The following new tours were announced. Check the Tour Dates category every day for more.

THE FOOTBALL RAMBLE

UK-based podcast The Football Ramble, featuring Luke Moore, Marcus Speller, Pete Donaldson and JIm Campbell, is heading across the pond for its first-ever North American live tapings where audiences can expect discussions on English Premier League, World Football, and how Americans are wrong to call football “soccer.” Says Moore: “We are beyond excited to be the first UK football podcast to play live theatre shows in the US, and have plenty of tricks up our sleeve to really make each show a night to remember. Expect lots of laughs, plenty of soccer chat and more than a few surprises as we bring our roadshow stateside for the first time ever. Marcus, Jim, Pete and I can’t wait to get cracking. It’s going to be a real experience. See you there, America!” The tour hits NYC’s Gramercy Theatre on November 5, Brooklyn’s Murmrr Theatre on 11/6, Toronto’s Danforth Music Hall on 11/7, and Chicago’s Thalia Hall on 11/8. Watch the tour trailer below:




THOM YORKE

Radiohead’s Thom Yorke will be back in North America in the spring for more dates of his All Tomorrow’s Boxes tour, including three sold-out NYC shows. He’s just added two Mexico dates to the tour, hitting Monterrey on April 22 and Guadalajara on April 24. He’s also got dates in Chicago, St. Paul, and Denver (will he play Coachella?) as well as summer festival dates around the world. Head here for his full schedule.

CHER WITH NILE RODGERS & CHIC

Cher has been on the Here We Go Again tour for most of this year which has been even more of a party thanks to Nile Rodgers & Chic being along for the ride. (They played Brooklyn in May and will be back for a MSG show in December.) Cher and Chic are gonna go again in 2020, starting March 6 in El Paso and going through May 6 in Sacramento. She’s got a Vegas run in February, too. Tickets for all 2020 shows go on sale Friday, November 8 and all dates are listed here.

KISS

KISS had previously planned to conclude their ‘End of the Road’ farewell tour in March 2020, but the end is now much further away as they’ve just added .

MAYHEM & ABBATH (2020 DECIBEL MAGAZINE TOUR)

Fellow Norwegian black metal bands Mayhem and Abbath will headline the 2020 edition of the Decibel Magazine Tour which happens in March & April. Stay tuned for openers.

RINGO STARR & HIS ALL-STAR BAND

Ringo, with help from his friends (like Colin Hay and Steve Lukather), will be back on the road in 2020.

BIKINI KILL

Bikini Kill reunited for shows this year, and their reunion will continue into 2020, at least for one show (so far). They just announced they’ll be playing Olympia, WA’s Capitol Theater on March 13, which will be a benefit for Interfaith Works.

SHELTER

Krishnacore legends Shelter are on a European tour as we speak, having just played the Sound of Revolution festival this past weekend with closely-related band Youth of Today and many others (videos of their sets are below). After the Europe tour ends, Shelter play Brooklyn and NJ shows, which come directly after Keystone Hardcore Jam III: Holiday Jawn at Reading, PA’s Reverb on 12/21 with Gorilla Biscuits, One King Down, Earth Crisis, Wisdom in Chains, Jesus Piece, and several others.

KNOCKED LOOSE

Keystone Hardcore Jam isn’t the only hardcore holiday show happening in Pennsylvania on December 21. About 35 miles away in Lancaster, PA is August Burns Red’s Christmas Burns Red show, which Knocked Loose were just added to. Knocked Loose, meanwhile, are on a headlining tour now and we just caught them in NYC last night. KL also tour Europe later this year, Australia/Asia in 2020, and they’re playing Sacramento’s Swanfest in April. All dates here.
