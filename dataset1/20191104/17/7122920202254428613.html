      <h1>Google Play Points: a rewards program for all the ways you Play</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Winston Mok</a></address>
      <p>Since 2012, Google Play has been your place to find and enjoy apps, games, movies, TV shows, and books. More than 2 billion people in 190 countries use Google Play to discover blockbuster movies, apps that help you be more productive, and books that inspire imagination.</p>
      <p>To show our appreciation, we created a new rewards program called Google Play Points that lets you earn points and rewards for the ways you already use Google Play. Over the past year, millions of people in Japan and South Korea have joined the program, and starting today, Google Play Points is launching in the United States.</p>
      <p>It’s free to join, and you can earn Play Points to use for special items and discounts in top games like Candy Crush Saga and Pokémon GO, or for Google Play Credit to use on movies, books, games, and apps.</p>
      <h3>Play your way and earn points</h3>
      <p>With Google Play Points, you’ll earn points on everything you buy with Google Play, including in-app items, movies, books, subscriptions and more. You can also earn Play Points by downloading featured free apps and games. Weekly points events can boost your earning rate on movies, books, and select games. </p>
      <p>Google Play Points has four levels, from Bronze to Platinum. Your level depends on how many points you’ve collected, and higher levels have perks like weekly prizes.</p>
      <h3>Redeem your Play Points how you’d like</h3>
      <p>We’re partnering with developers of some of the top apps and games on Google Play so that you can redeem points for special in-app items like characters, gems and more. You can also use Play Points for Google Play Credit and rent an award-winning movie or buy a best-selling audiobook. </p>
      <p>We’ve been inspired by the Play community’s generosity and participation in <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-play/give-back-charitable-donations-google-play/">Play Store giving</a>. You can use your points to help support a great cause—or causes—of your choice from a rotating list of nonprofits, starting with Doctors Without Borders USA, Save the Children and the World Food Program USA. </p>
