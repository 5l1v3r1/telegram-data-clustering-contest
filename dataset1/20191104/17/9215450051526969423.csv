月供股票是不少人的長線投資之選，眾所周知，月供股票是採用「平均成本法」，投資門欖較低，但對月供股票的實際運作就不太了解。例如月供港股是否只限藍籌股？可否月供美股？月供股票邊間好？在中銀、恒生或𣾀豐等銀行開戶？抑或在證券行進行月供股票？今次《經濟一週》會逐一比較各個月供平台的門欖，以及解答月供股票的投資組合、派息及回報等疑難。

月供股票是甚麼？
月供股票被稱為「懶人投資法」，以「平均成本法」進行投資。簡單來說，投資者能以類似儲蓄的方式，每月定期買入股票。假設投資者是月供盈富基金（2800），每月投入金額5,000元，以下是他月供半年的投資組合：


投資月份
每月投資金額 （未扣除手續費）
每股購入價
購入股數
投資淨額


5月
5,000
29.9
167
4,993.3


6月
5,000
27.2
183
4,977.6


7月
5,000
29.4
170
4,998


8月
5,000
28.3
176
4,980.8


9月
5,000
26.65
187
4,983.55


10月
5,000
27.05
184
4,977.2


根據以上的月供例子，投資者的平均成本價格（港元）= 總投資淨額／總購入股數= 29,930.45/1,067= 28.05
月供股票毋須以每手作為購買單位，因此投資者可以盡快把現金轉為股票。市面上有不少銀行及證券行提供月供股票計劃，主要分為固定供款額和固定供股數兩種選擇，前者是指每月供款金額固定，例如是月供5,000元，所得股份則隨股價而定；而後者則是指每月供股數量固定，例如月供200股，每月供款額隨股價而有所不同。
投資者只需每月支付手續費，便能以已設定的總金額買入股票。一般的月供股票手續費約為50元至100元，另外視乎月供平台的要求，部分銀行及證券行或會有存倉費、出售股票附加費等，投資者在進行月供前，需先留意個別銀行或證券行的收費。

月供股票可以供甚麼？
月供股票的選擇視乎銀行或證券行的名單而定，除了有大家熟知的藍籌股外，亦不乏各個板塊的股份。以中銀為例，其月供股票名單涵蓋逾150隻股份，當中包括公用、地產、銀行、保險、工業、ETF及房地產信託基金等板塊，投資者可以就自己的月供平台去選擇心水股份。

部分投資者對月供美股有興趣，事實上，投資美股與港股不一樣，美股的交易單位是一股股，入場門欖較港股低。因此，很多人會直接買入美股，而不進行月供美股。現時本港提供月供美股計劃的選擇不多。以寶盛證券（Boom）為例，每月最低供款額為150美元（約1,177港元），詳情可按此獲取。

月供股票如何收息？
月供股票當然可以收息！雖然投資者手上的股份未必是整數，但依然是有息可收，其股息會按其股份數目的比例來計算。以盈富基金（2800）來計算，假設每股派息0.15元，而投資者手上有1,067股，即投資者可獲160.05元的股息。
碎股怎麼辦？
由於月供股票不是以一手手買入股份，因此，不可避免會有碎股，亦有很多投資者會擔心碎股的售出價格有折讓，其價格會較正常股價低。市面上部分月供平台如中銀香港，會以正價買回投資者的碎股。
月供股票的好處及壞處
優點：

低入場費：每月花約1,000元即可開始月供股票，且能以較低入場費買藍籌股。
平均成本：長遠做到低價買入的效果，亦能減低風險。
無須「睇市」：決定股票及月供金額後便不用理會。
信用卡儲分：部分銀行的月供股票計劃可以賺取信用卡積分。
減低心理壓力：投資者不用擔心短期賺蝕，因為月供股票是看長期。

缺點：

月供股票選擇有限：主要提供藍籌股的選項，未必涵蓋冷門或細價股。
交易執行有局限：交易操作並非由供款者自訂，缺乏補捉時機的彈性。
碎股問題：部分月供平台保證購入碎股，如果不是在這些平台沽出碎股，股價或有折讓。

[Monthly for stocks on the side of the stock] Monthly for Hong Kong stocks to set up US stocks, bank-based securities banks to open accounts, have dividends received?
04 Nov 2019, 17:00 by Investment
Monthly stocks are the long-term investment choice for many people. As we all know, monthly stocks use the ""average cost method"", which has a low investment threshold, but it is not well understood for the actual operation of monthly stocks. For example, is the monthly supply of Hong Kong stocks limited to blue chips? Can you supply US stocks monthly? Is the month for stocks good? Open an account with a bank like BOC, Hang Seng or Fu Feng? Or do you make monthly stocks at the securities firm? This ""Economic Week"" will compare the monthly platform for each month and answer the monthly investment portfolio, dividends and returns.

What is the monthly stock price?
Monthly stocks are called ""lazy investment law"" and are invested in the ""average cost method"". Simply put, investors can buy stocks on a monthly basis in a similar way. Suppose the investor is the monthly fund for the Rich Fund (2800), and the monthly investment amount is 5,000 yuan. The following is his monthly investment portfolio for half a year:


Investment month
Monthly investment amount (without deduction of handling fee)
Purchase price per share
Number of shares purchased
Net investment


May
5,000
29.9
167
4,993.3


June
5,000
27.2
183
4,977.6


July
5,000
29.4
170
4,998


August
5,000
28.3
176
4,980.8


September
5,000
26.65
187
4,983.55


October
5,000
27.05
184
4,977.2


According to the above monthly example, the average cost price of investors (HKD) = total net investment / total number of shares purchased = 29,930.45/1,067= 28.05
Monthly stocks are not required to be purchased per lot, so investors can convert cash into stocks as soon as possible. There are many banks and securities firms in the market that offer monthly stock offerings. They are mainly divided into fixed contributions and fixed rights. The former refers to a fixed monthly contribution, for example, a monthly payment of 5,000 yuan. The latter is based on the stock price; the latter refers to a fixed number of monthly rights issues, such as 200 shares per month, and the monthly contribution varies with the stock price.
Investors can buy stocks at the total amount already set by paying a monthly fee. The average monthly stock handling fee is about 50 yuan to 100 yuan. In addition, depending on the requirements of the monthly supply platform, some banks and securities banks may have storage fees and stock surcharges. Investors are required to make monthly payments. Pay attention to the charges of individual banks or securities firms.

What can be provided for monthly stocks?
The choice of monthly stocks depends on the list of banks or securities firms. In addition to well-known blue chip stocks, there are also stocks in various sectors. Take BOC as an example. Its monthly stock list covers more than 150 shares, including public, real estate, banking, insurance, industry, ETF and real estate trust funds. Investors can choose Xinshui shares for their monthly supply platform. .

Some investors are interested in monthly US stocks. In fact, investing in US stocks is not the same as Hong Kong stocks. The trading unit of US stocks is one stock, and the entry price is lower than that of Hong Kong stocks. Therefore, many people will buy US stocks directly instead of monthly US stocks. At present, there are not many options for providing monthly housing stocks in Hong Kong. In the case of Boom, the minimum monthly contribution is $150 (approximately HK$1,177), details can be obtained here.

How does the monthly stock exchange rate?
Monthly stocks can of course pay interest! Although the shares in the hands of investors are not necessarily integers, they are still interest-bearing, and their dividends will be calculated based on the proportion of their shares. Calculated by the Tracker Fund (2800), assuming a dividend of 0.15 yuan per share, and investors have 1,067 shares, that is, investors can receive a dividend of 160.05 yuan.
What about shredded stocks?
Since monthly stocks are not bought in one hand, there will inevitably be odd stocks. Many investors will worry that the selling price of odd stocks will be discounted, and the price will be lower than the normal stock price. Some monthly platforms such as BOC Hong Kong will buy back the odd lots of investors at a positive price.
The benefits and disadvantages of monthly stocks
advantage:

Low admission fee: You can start monthly stocks for about $1,000 a month, and you can buy blue chips at a lower entrance fee.
Average cost: The effect of buying at a low price in the long run can also reduce the risk.
There is no need to ""catch the market"": after deciding on the stock and monthly payment, you will ignore it.
Credit card deposits: Some banks' monthly stock plans can earn credit card points.
Reducing psychological stress: Investors don't have to worry about short-term earnings, because monthly stocks are long-term.

Disadvantages:

Limited monthly stock options: The option to provide blue chip stocks may not cover unpopular or penny stocks.
There are limits to the execution of the transaction: the trading operation is not customized by the contributor and lacks the flexibility of the timing of the capture.
Fragmented stocks: Some monthly platforms guarantee the purchase of odd lots. If the odd lots are not sold on these platforms, the stock price may have a discount.
