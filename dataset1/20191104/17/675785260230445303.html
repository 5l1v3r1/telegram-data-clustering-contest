      <h1>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp cannot repeat Man City ‘mistake’ in crunch title clash</h1>
      <h2>The sides face off in their first showdown of the season on Sunday with the Reds holding a six-point advantage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:52:40+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> has been warned not to make the same mistake against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> - or face the consequences in the title race.</p>
      <p>The Reds have opened up a six-point lead on their rivals ahead of the clash between the two sides at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Last season <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were seven points clear when they travelled to the Etihad in January, but were beaten as City caught them up to defend their crown.</p>
      <p>Klopp's men had let City off the hook in a dull contest at Anfield earlier in the campaign, which former Reds midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jamie-redknapp">Jamie Redknapp</a> feels was crucial.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool cannot make the same mistake they made last season when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> left Anfield with a 0-0 draw," Redknapp told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/columnist-348/Jamie-Redknapp-Daily-Mail.html">the Mail</a> .</p>

      <p>"Jurgen Klopp's men were passive last October. In hindsight, we can see how costly it was that they only picked up one point rather than three.</p>
      <p>"This Sunday, they should go for the win and strike a psychological blow."</p>
      <p>Despite the draw, Liverpool were perhaps fortunate to take anything from that fixture, with City's Riyad Mahrez missing a penalty in the dying minutes.</p>

      <p>The return fixture saw City win 2-1 by the finest of margins, as John Stones's clearance off the line stayed out of the net by millimetres, and proved significant to their surge for the title.</p>
      <p>There have already been subtle jibes between both managers ahead of Sunday's match, after Klopp hit back at Pep Guardiola's claims that Sadio Mane was a diver.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese forward was booked for simulation against Aston Villa on Saturday, before heading in an injury-time winner.</p>

      <p>City boss Guardiola said: "It's happened a lot for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the last years [scoring late on]. It's because he's a special talent.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes he's diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute. He's a talent."</p>
      <p>Klopp took umbrage with his adversary, responding: "Sadio is not a diver. Yes there was a situation in the Aston Villa game where he felt contact and went down.</p>

      <p>“Maybe it was not a penalty but there was contact.</p>
      <p>“It's not like he jumped over a leg or something. All the other penalties were penalties because he was there.</p>
      <p>“If something like that had happened for Manchester City I'm sure they would have wanted a penalty too.”</p>
      <p>The teams are both involved in respective Champions League ties this week, before Sunday's clash which kicks off at 4:30pm (GMT).</p>
