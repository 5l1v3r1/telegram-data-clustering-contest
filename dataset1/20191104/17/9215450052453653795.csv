壞消息當好消息炒！後市易升難跌｜溫鋼城
04 Nov 2019, 17:10 by 溫鋼城
環球上週大事眾多，但最終還是一如往常有驚無險，令MSCI世界指數更上一層樓，按週升了1.3%，且跟美股一樣創出了連升4週紀錄，兩者走勢大同小異。港股則經歷上上星期小跌52點，上週重拾升勢上揚了1.62%或433點⋯⋯全球股市看似喜氣洋洋重拾上升動力。

美國經濟數據有瑕疵
然而，上升最給力的上週五，美國經濟數據絕非好到那麼利害，例如非農就業數據12.8萬人，較預期9萬人理想，但跟過往大部份時間持續於15萬以上，已是顯著減少了。同時，ISM製造業採購經理指數亦持續3個月，徘徊於50以下萎縮區間。反映中小微企的Markit製造業採購經理指數，亦同樣有51.5回落至51.3 ，遜於預期的51.5，可見經濟數據並非毫無瑕疵。
關鍵是大市要升，壞消息當然可以視而不見，當較預期好便繼續炒作。類似情況同樣發生於美國進行中第3季業績公布期，根據路透最新數據顯示，已公布業績的356間企業，佔標指505間企業超過7成，業績優於預期企業比例正由最初的82%，縮減至目前只有76%，但整體盈利還是預期會下滑0.8%，只是沒有最初預期下跌2.2%而已，便一直上揚至今。
事實上，目前美股表現類似年初，即同樣持續升連升4星期，至第5星期才出現過最多2%回落，當時下跌是因為特朗普胡言亂語，上升則因為美聯儲對加息“極度忍耐”，與及中美貿談似有利好消息。同樣場景本週會否再演一次？
利淡方面，目前正被民主黨調查的特朗普，恐怕再胡言亂語機會不大。利好而言，似乎自美聯儲局重啟量化寬鬆，持續每月買入600億美元短債，與及中美分階段簽署貿易協議，後市（尤其美股）看來還是易升難跌，故建議加碼增持美股，只要沒有完全回補至10月11日，介乎於2,963至2,948點裂囗。

Bad news when good news is fried! The market is easy to rise and fall | Wengang City
04 Nov 2019, 17:10 by Wengang City
Global has had a lot of events last week, but in the end it was as usual as a surprise. The MSCI World Index rose to a higher level, rising by 1.3% on a weekly basis, and it recorded the same four-week record as the US stocks. The two trends are similar. Hong Kong stocks experienced a 52-point drop last week. Last week, the stock market rose by 1.62% or 433 points. The global stock market seems to be eager to regain its upward momentum.

US economic data is flawed
However, the most powerful rise last Friday, the US economic data is not so good, such as non-agricultural employment data of 128,000, more than expected 90,000 ideal, but for most of the past more than 150,000, has It is significantly reduced. At the same time, the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index also lasted for three months, squatting below the 50-inch contraction range. The Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which reflects small and medium-sized enterprises, also fell 51.5 to 51.3, which was worse than the expected 51.5. It can be seen that economic data is not without flaws.
The key is that the big market will rise, and bad news can of course turn a blind eye. When it is better than expected, it will continue to speculate. A similar situation occurred in the third quarter of the United States in the performance of the third quarter results, according to the latest data from Reuters, 356 companies that have announced results, accounting for more than 70% of the 505 companies, the ratio of performance is better than the expected proportion of the original 82 %, reduced to only 76%, but the overall profit is still expected to fall by 0.8%, but it has not risen by 2.2% without initial expectations.
In fact, the performance of US stocks is similar to that of the beginning of the year, that is, it has continued to rise for 4 weeks, and it has only experienced a maximum of 2% decline in the 5th week. The decline was due to Trump’s nonsense, and the rise was due to the Fed’s extreme interest rate hike. ""Patience"", and the Sino-US trade talks are good news. Will the same scene be played again this week?
In terms of blessings, Trump, who is currently being investigated by the Democratic Party, is afraid that there will be little chance of gibberish. Fortunately, it seems that since the Fed restarted quantitative easing, and continued to buy 60 billion US dollars of short-term debt each month, and signed a trade agreement with China and the United States in stages, the market outlook (especially US stocks) seems to be easy to rise and fall, so it is recommended to increase the code. The increase in holdings of US stocks, as long as it is not fully repaid to October 11, is between 2,963 and 2,948 points.
