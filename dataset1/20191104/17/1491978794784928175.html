        <i>The founder of Polpo has made a list of everything he hates about eating out. I disagree with most of it, but here are my own bugbears – from time slots to up-selling</i>
      </p>
      <p>When the restaurateur <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/russell-norman-restaurant-founder">Russell Norman</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7641477/Restaurateur-Russell-Norman-reveals-trades-ten-annoying-traits.html">makes a list of everything he hates about eating out</a>, this is a giant act of generosity: the man pretty much invented the small plate (the whole grand concept of making things so delicious that you don’t mind a tiny portion). Nevertheless, I have checked the list and disagree with most of it. For instance …</p>
      <p>The founder of the Polpo restaurants hates the question: “Do you have a reservation?” (It’s actually OK, if you still run a booking system, to ask people if they have booked); the “concept” (fair enough, but we are all humans just trying to plant a flag on the shifting soil); “artisanal”, “hand-cut”, square plates, novelty crockery (OK, granted); sommeliers sniffing corks (there is a theatrical framework to all human activity – what Lakoff would call Metaphors We Live By; sniffing stuff is merely part of that frame); waiters who go: “Don’t worry – I’ll remember everything” (but what if they can?): also, ones who say “Enjoy” (castigating expressions of goodwill is very 1980s).</p>
      <p>There are, however, plenty of things to legitimately hate about restaurants, of which these are merely the tip of the iceberg:</p>
      <h3>Parsimonious time slots</h3>
      <p>If you want people in and out, invent Leon. If you want to create a Faine Daining experience, put up with the fact that people will linger. This hit its apex when Brasserie Zédel started offering tables in slots of a single hour (relatedly: mad rushing from one course to the next; offering lunch and dinner reservations at times when no one has ever eaten lunch or dinner).</p>
      <h3>No way of booking</h3>
      <p>Even while I understand the last decade’s move towards not booking but simply turning up, let’s be frank that it favours the restaurant not the punter; they overcome the curse of the no-show, we get to spend half an hour in a queue. So when they overlay a bunch of other stipulations – your entire party has to be present before you can join the list, you have to wait on the street, not in the pub, etc – they’re having a laugh.</p>
      <h3>Menu patter</h3>
      <p>In menu rubric, nothing is more annoying that spelling out the price in words when perfectly good numbers exist (“scotch egg; five pounds”); except, possibly, chatting on the menu (“we love this little farm, and they produce the best damn offal within 50 miles” etc). Oh, wait: proselytising ethical statements that make no sense are bad, too: when the Duck and Waffle opened on Bishopsgate, in London, the menu honestly stated: “All our ingredients are seasonally sourced from all over the world”, entirely meaningless given that everything’s in season somewhere.</p>
      <h3>Up-selling</h3>
      <p>Sommeliers who hover over you, trying to make you feel bad about keeping to the top third of the list; anyone warning you that you will still be hungry if you don’t order a starter; anyone giving you the fish-eye when you don’t want pudding. First rule for everyone involved in the emotional co-production that is public eating: stay classy.</p>
