      <p>If you could catch a two-second glimpse of random people's dreams, you'd see some real weird shit. That's also true of <i>Dreams</i>, the PlayStation 4 game from <i>LittleBigPlanet </i>maker Media Molecule.</p>
      <p>In this ten-minute montage assembled by YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe9PdgvvRqaUdp6Mkm-wtlQ">jiar300</a>, we're shown a couple of seconds from 300 different user-made creations in <i>Dreams</i>. The sheer variety on display is ridiculous.</p>

      <p>Some of these Dreams are original games (shout-out to the always impressive kaiju rampage project <a href="https://indreams.me/dream/mBFdayRFryJ">Ruckus</a>), while others are riffs on existing titles like <i>Dead Space</i>. That's to say nothing of sculptures, paintings, songs, and animations. There are so many possibilities in <i>Dreams</i> â€“ it's astounding.</p>
      <p>The art-making game is still available at its cheaper-than-normal <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA08010_00-DREAMS0000000000?smcid=pdc%3Aus-en%3Aweb-pdc-games-dreams-ps4%3Awaystobuy-Buy%20Dreams%20Creator%20Early%20Access%3Anull%3A">Early Access</a> price ahead of its full launch, if you're on the fence. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../early-access-review-dreams-551863.phtml">It's worth the thirty bucks</a> if you have a single artistic bone in your body. At this point, even if you're purely looking to play rather than create, there's no shortage of stuff to find.</p>
      <p>I'm increasingly curious about Media Molecule's plans for <i>Dreams </i>once the PlayStation 5 hits.</p>
