      <p>Lebanon's Al Ahed clinched the AFC Cup Monday with a dominant 1-0 win over 10-man 4.25 SC from North Korea, a game shifted to Malaysia from Pyongyang following a blacked-out World Cup qualifier.<br/><br/>The final of Asia's second-tier club tournament was moved following last month's surreal showdown between North and South Korea, which took place with no live broadcast and no foreign media in attendance.<br/><br/>Issah Yakubu scored the winner in the 74th minute, heading in a cross from Hussein Dakik, as the Lebanese finally broke through the North Koreans' resolute defense.<br/><br/>The game started off looking fairly evenly matched, but the turning point came midway through the first half when North Korea's goalkeeper An Tae Song was sent off.<br/><br/>He had appeared to trip up an Al Ahed player on the edge of the box as he charged towards the goal.<br/><br/>Al Ahed then became totally dominant, launching attack after attack, but the first half ended 0-0.<br/><br/>The Lebanese side missed some good chances -- just before half time, Ahmed Akaichi managed to miss an easy shot on goal, firing the ball over the crossbar from a short distance out.<br/><br/>After losing a player, the North Koreans never looked like a threat -- barely getting near their opponents' goal -- but they put up a strong defense and Al Ahed only broke through towards the end.<br/><br/>Al Ahed are the first Lebanese side to win the AFC Cup since it started in 2004.<br/><br/>The AFC Cup was initially moved from Pyongyang to Shanghai -- only to be moved again days later to Kuala Lumpur.<br/><br/>The Asian Football Confederation did not mention the North-South Korea showdown when they shifted the match but said commercial partners were worried about broadcasting the game.</p>
