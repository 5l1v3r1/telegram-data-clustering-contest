      <p>(MINNEAPOLIS) — A state senator from Minnesota says he’s the victim of “<a href="https://time.com/5712395/katie-hill-resigns-nude-photos/">revenge porn</a>” perpetrated by a “former friend” who sent explicit images to legislative colleagues.</p>
      <p>Democratic Sen. Scott Dibble says he’s been harassed for the past five months by a man with whom he had an intimate, virtual relationship. Dibble, who is married, said the man sent private photos, videos, and text messages to fellow lawmakers on Friday. A spokeswoman for the Minnesota’s Democratic Farmer-Labor Party, Ellen Anderson, confirmed that lawmakers received such messages.</p>
