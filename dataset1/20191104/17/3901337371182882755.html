      <p>The win saw Liverpool maintain their six-point lead at the top of the table ahead of their clash against reigning champions Manchester City on Sunday, and also equal an all-time league record.</p>

      <p>Chelsea were the first team to achieve the feat during the 2005/06 season, and were matched by City in 2011/12 and 2017/18, with both clubs going to win the title in each of those campaigns.</p>
