（中央社記者張雄風台北4日電）行政院環境保護署今天表示，自民國109年起施行機車汰舊換新補助辦法，針對二行程及四行程一至四期燃油機車，若汰換並新購電動機車或七期燃油機車，最高可補助新台幣5000元。
環保署今天發布「機車汰舊換新補助辦法」草案，針對民國96年6月30日前出廠的燃油機車（含二行程與四行程）汰舊並新購電動機車或七期燃油機車，於109年最高可補助5000元。
根據草案，自109年起汰舊換新重型電動機車、七期燃油車可補助5000元，輕型及小型輕型電動機車補助3000元；110年起重型電動機車、七期燃油車可補助3000元，輕型及小型輕型電動機車補助1000元。
環保署空氣品質保護及噪音管制處長蔡孟裕表示，符合汰換標準的機車約320萬輛，其中約7成仍在使用中；為加速改善空氣品質，這次草案最主要擴大汰舊補助對象至四行程一至四期的燃油機車，不再僅限於二行程機車。
蔡孟裕指出，若進一步區分，符合汰換標準的二行程機車約70萬輛，現在仍使用中約30萬輛；兩年預算分別估計達4億5000萬元，明年預計回收10萬輛機車，後年因單價較低，因此估計能回收15萬輛機車，希望透過補助能將二行程機車都汰換掉。
草案預計於109年1月1日施行，依辦法申請補助者，以購車發票日期認定補助年度；若申請人過去曾依環保署新購電動輔助自行車補助辦法、新購電動自行車補助辦法、淘汰二行程機車及新購電動二輪車補助辦法申請電動二輪車補助者，不予補助。（編輯：管中維）1081104

The locomotive replacement and replacement subsidy for 109 years is implemented up to 5,000 yuan
04 Nov 2019, 17:29 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Zhang Xiongfeng, Taipei, 4th) The Environmental Protection Department of the Executive Yuan said today that since the Republic of China, the implementation of the locomotive replacement subsidy scheme for the second and fourth rounds of the first to fourth phases of fuel locomotives has been replaced. The car or the seven-phase fuel locomotive can be subsidized up to NT$5,000.
The Environmental Protection Department released the draft ""Motorcycle Replacement Subsidy Scheme"" today, which is aimed at the old-fashioned diesel locomotives (including the second and fourth trips) before the Republic of China on June 30, 1996, and newly purchased electric motor vehicles or seven-phase fuel locomotives. The maximum annual subsidy is 5,000 yuan.
According to the draft, since the beginning of 109, the old heavy-duty electric motor car and the seven-phase fuel car can be subsidized by 5,000 yuan, and the light and small light-duty electric vehicles are subsidized by 3,000 yuan. In 110 years, the heavy-duty electric motor car and the seven-phase fuel car can be subsidized by 3,000 yuan. Light and small light electric vehicles are subsidized by 1,000 yuan.
According to Cai Mengyu, Director of the Air Quality Protection and Noise Control Department of the Environmental Protection Department, about 3.2 million locomotives are in compliance with the replacement standards, of which about 70% are still in use. To speed up the improvement of air quality, this draft is mainly to expand the old subsidy target to four. Fuel locomotives from the first to fourth phases are no longer limited to two-stroke locomotives.
Cai Mengyu pointed out that if further distinction is made, about 700,000 two-stroke locomotives that meet the replacement criteria are still used by about 300,000 vehicles; the two-year budget is estimated to be 450 million yuan respectively, and 100,000 locomotives are expected to be recovered next year. Due to the low unit price, it is estimated that 150,000 locomotives will be recovered. It is hoped that the two-stroke locomotives will be replaced by subsidies.
The draft is expected to be implemented on January 1, 109. According to the method of applying for subsidies, the subsidy year will be determined by the date of purchase of the vehicle; if the applicant has previously purchased the subsidy method for electric assisted bicycles, the newly purchased electric bicycle subsidy method, and the elimination of two If you apply for an electric two-wheeler subsidy for the locomotive and the newly purchased electric two-wheeler subsidy, no subsidy will be granted.
