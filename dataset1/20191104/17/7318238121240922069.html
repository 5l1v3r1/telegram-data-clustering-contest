      <p>Facebook introduced a new brand Monday: FACEBOOK.</p>
      <p>The company announced in a blog post that the new brand, which retains the name of the social network, would have a new logo to better indicate all the various products and services it now offers, including Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>"Today, we're updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook," Antonio Lucio, the company's chief marketing officer, wrote in the blog post. "We're introducing a new company logo and further distinguishing the Facebook company from the Facebook app, which will keep its own branding."</p>
      <p>The timing of the move is notable because the company faces calls from politicians and consumer advocates for the government to break it up into various pieces.</p>

      <p>"This brand change is a way to better communicate our ownership structure to the people and businesses who use our services to connect, share, build community and grow their audiences," Lucio wrote.</p>
      <p>The new logo features Facebook in capitalized letters with "custom typography." The company said the new brand would appear on Instagram, WhatsApp and its other offerings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-become-part-new-holding-company-alphabet-restructuring-n407416">Google made a similar move</a> in 2015, but called its new parent company Alphabet and restructured its company to make Google a subsidiary.</p>
