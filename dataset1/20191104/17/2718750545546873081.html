      <h1>Michael Jackson’s Estate Acquires Sly and the Family Stone’s Catalogue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:20:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>The Estate of Michael Jackson/MIJAC Music has acquired majority ownership of Sly and the Family Stone’s catalogue in the United States. Outside of the U.S., it owns the entirety of the band’s catalogue. In a press release obtained by <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/michael-jackson-estate-acquires-sly-and-the-family-stone-catalog/">Pitchfork</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/every-grammys-rap-rock-performance-ranked.html">Sly Stone</a> said, “Thank You Mijac (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” a reference to the 1969 Sly and the Family Stone hit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOa5UOHdwnc">Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)</a>.”</p>
      <p>“Sly and the Family Stone were a force for enlightenment and positive change, a message that Michael believed in,” the estate’s co-executors John McClain and John Branca added in the release. “He recognized [Sly Stone]’s genius and the power of his words and music which is why he first acquired the catalog and why we at MIJAC follow in Michael’s footsteps today.” </p>
      <p>Sly and the Family Stone’s royalties have been hotly disputed, even in recent years. Just a year ago, <a href="https://variety.com/2018/music/news/primary-wave-music-publishing-acquires-sly-the-family-stone-catalog-1203081193/">Primary Wave Music Publishing claimed</a> to have interest in the band’s catalogue, but the Jackson Estate disputed those claims. In 2010, Sly Stone sued his longtime manager, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/arts/music/30arts-SLYSTONESUES_BRF.html?smid=pl-share">Jerry Goldstein</a>, for allegedly defrauding Stone of “tens of millions” in royalties. A jury awarded Stone $5 million in damages in 2015, but later that year <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-sly-stone-royalties-20151211-story.html">a judge ruled</a> that Stone could not collect because he sold his royalties to a production company in the 1980s.</p>
