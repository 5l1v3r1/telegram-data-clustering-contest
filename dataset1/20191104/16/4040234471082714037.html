      <p>For months, cybersecurity analysts have sounded the alarm about a serious vulnerability in old Microsoft operating systems that, if exploited, could infect computers around the world.</p>
      <p>The hacking has finally begun, and so far, it’s gone off with a whimper, not a bang.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, a security researcher who maintains “honeypots,” or simulated environments to trap malicious activity, reported a spike in attacks exploiting the Remote Desktop Protocol vulnerability, known as BlueKeep. But rather than anything “wormable” that can spread from machine to machine, this appears to be a case of opportunists scanning the internet to infect computers for monetary gain. Researchers had warned that BlueKeep could enable outsiders to execute remote code on a compromised machine.</p>
      <p>Kevin Beaumont, the researcher who gave <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/bluekeep/">BlueKeep</a> its name, reported that nearly all of his honeypots had been hit by attackers exploiting the vulnerability. Hackers appear to be using the exploit to try to install a cryptocurrency miner, Beaumont <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/bluekeep-exploitation-activity-seen-in-the-wild-bd6ee6e599a6">noted</a>, which would allow them to generate virtual cash.</p>
      <p>“This has been going on for weeks now and shows no signs of stopping,” Beaumont said.</p>
      <p>Rather than taking remote control of the machines, the attackers are causing them to crash.</p>
      <p>“It seems likely that a low-level actor scanned the internet and opportunistically infected vulnerable hosts using out-of-the-box penetration testing utilities,” said <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/marcus-hutchins/">Marcus Hutchins</a>, a researcher at Krpytos Logic who worked with Beaumont to track BlueKeep.</p>
      <p>While a nuisance, <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/cryptomining/">cryptomining</a> is not what researchers feared when BlueKeep emerged in May. Organizations from Microsoft itself to the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/bluekeep-dhs-code-test/">urged</a> users to patch for the vulnerability because, like the flaw exploited by the 2017 <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/wannacry/">WannaCry</a> virus, BlueKeep is wormable. That means that malware abusing it can cascade across unpatched systems.</p>
      <p>WannaCry spread to over 200,000 machines in 150 countries, costing Britain’s National Health Service alone more than $100 million. Concerns about a repeat have motivated researchers to <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/bluekeep-removal-remote-desktop-wannacry-notpetya/">write their own</a> BlueKeep exploits to warn organizations of the danger. The number of devices affected by this scanning activity was not immediately clear.</p>
      <p>Chief information security officers trying to protect enterprise networks <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/patching-vulnerability-plan-microsoft-equifax-linkedin/">previously told CyberScoop</a> they saw an influx of scanning activity around BlueKeep as soon as a proof-of-concept was made public.</p>
      <p>Following the spike in activity in recent days, BlueKeep watchers urged computer users not to take the lack of a serious worm for granted.</p>
      <p>“Right now, we do not see any indication of a widespread worm at play. However, that could happen at any moment,” Craig Williams, director of outreach at Cisco’s threat intelligence team, <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/talos/">Talos</a>, said in an email to CyberScoop. “Users need to patch immediately or apply remediation strategies to unpatched systems to prevent exploitation.”</p>
      <p>“A widespread worm gets a lot of attention and creates quite a bit of damage. Often these are things criminals do not want,” Williams added. “Attention, especially from law enforcement, is something they try to avoid.”</p>
      <p>The high stakes may be why we still haven’t seen BlueKeep exploited on the scale that many feared.</p>
      <p>“One might theorize that attackers know they have essentially one shot at using it at scale, and it becomes a game of chicken as to who will do it first,” Hutchins <a href="https://www.kryptoslogic.com/blog/2019/11/bluekeep-cve-2019-0708-exploitation-spotted-in-the-wild/?source=post_page-----bd6ee6e599a6----------------------">said</a>.</p>
