Apple gives out codes to activate Apple TV + subscription, but not for everyone
04 Nov 2019, 16:57 by Artyom Bausov
Last week, Apple TV + streaming cinema service officially launched around the world. Everyone who bought the new device from September 10 could get a year of free subscription.
Topic: Overview of the Apple TV + service and its series. Have something to see?
However, some users have not received access to the service. In this case, Apple has a solution:
1. Go to the Apple TV + page.
2. Log in to your Apple ID.
3. On the same page, request a subscription activation code in the App Store.
4. Go to the App Store and at the very bottom of the page click Enter code.
