      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:05:11+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>The wife of tragic Rangers legend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-northern-ireland-fernando-ricksen-20555730">Fernando Ricksen</a> has a new clothing line launched in memory of her husband to 'keep his spirit alive'.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-one <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/rangers-legend-fernando-ricksens-wife-20393579">Veronika</a> announced the limited edition collection designed alongside Gers clothing brand The Bears Den on Instagram this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The range includes special t-shirts similar to those worn by Fernando's family and close friends at his funeral after he lost a brave six-year battle with Motor Neurone Disease at an Airdrie hospice on September 18.</p>
      <p>Former team-mates Michael Mols and Nacho Novo were among those seen wearing the tops at the September 25 service in Glasgow's west end.</p>
      <p>The tops are emblazoned with a picture of the late midfielder and the words 'Fernando, Simply the best', with the 43-year-old's squad number, 2, printed on the back and chest.</p>
      <p>Fans can also get their hands on similarly designed hoodies and onsies, which come in all sizes for men, women and children.</p>

      <p>It comes after we revealed heartbroken Veronika finds everyday more difficult without her beloved husband back in October.</p>
      <p>She posted an emotional tribute video of pictures of the couple in happier times in honour of her late partner.</p>
      <p>It came two weeks after thousands of Light Blues fans lined the streets of Glasgow on the day of his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/fernando-ricksen-fans-line-streets-20172299">funeral</a> .</p>
      <p>As the hearse carrying the Dutchman’s coffin was taken past  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers">Ibrox</a> , crowds chanted, “There’s only one Fernando Ricksen”.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the aftermath of his funeral at Glasgow's Wellington Church Veronika said she tells their daughter Isabella how her 'Pappy is a star in the sky'.</p>

      <p>She said: “We’ve told her he’s a star now.</p>
      <p>"Every evening, we go outside and I pick the brightest star and say, ‘Look, Isabella, Pappy is looking down at you.’ Once she said she could see his face and it broke my heart.</p>
      <p>“She will grow up without a dad and that hurts. It’s so hard. She’s still so little."</p>
      <p>You can view the range, which starts at £22.95, <a href="https://www.thebearsden.co.uk/product-category/fernando">here</a> .</p>
