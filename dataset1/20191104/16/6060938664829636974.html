      <h1>Lebanon's Al Ahed clinch AFC Cup with win over North Korean side</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Lebanon's Al Ahed clinched the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/AFC-Cup">AFC Cup</a> Monday with a dominant 1-0 win over 10-man 4.25 SC from North Korea, a game shifted to Malaysia from Pyongyang following a blacked-out World Cup qualifier.</p>
      <p>The final of Asia's second-tier club tournament was moved following last month's surreal showdown between North and South Korea, which took place with no live broadcast and no foreign media in attendance.</p>
      <p>Issah Yakubu scored the winner in the 74th minute, heading in a cross from Hussein Dakik, as the Lebanese finally broke through the North Koreans' resolute defence.</p>
      <p>The game started off looking fairly evenly matched, but the turning point came midway through the first half when North Korea's goalkeeper An Tae Song was sent off.</p>
      <p>He had appeared to trip up an Al Ahed player on the edge of the box as he charged towards the goal.</p>
      <p>Al Ahed then became totally dominant, launching attack after attack, but the first half ended 0-0.</p>
      <p>The Lebanese side missed some good chances -- just before half time, Ahmed Akaichi managed to miss an easy shot on goal, firing the ball over the crossbar from a short distance out.</p>
      <p>After losing a player, the North Koreans never looked like a threat -- barely getting near their opponents' goal -- but they put up a strong defence and Al Ahed only broke through towards the end.</p>
      <p>Al Ahed are the first Lebanese side to win the AFC Cup since it started in 2004.</p>
      <p>The AFC Cup was initially moved from Pyongyang to Shanghai -- only to be moved again days later to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-Football-Confederation">Asian Football Confederation</a> did not mention the North-South Korea showdown when they shifted the match but said commercial partners were worried about broadcasting the game.</p>
