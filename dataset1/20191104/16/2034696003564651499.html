      </ul>
      <p>The record went under the hammer at Wessex Auction Rooms at Westbrook Farm in Chippenham last Friday (November 1) and was expected to fetch between £12,000-£15,000.</p>
      <p>The record was described by the auctioneers as “a superb copy of one of the rarest and most sought after records in the world. Contained in original A&amp;M sleeve, and within card sleeve with A&amp;M Records sticker.”</p>
      <p>The single was originally recorded for A&amp;M Records in 1977. The label dropped the band before it was released and most of the copies were destroyed. Martin Hughes, of Wessex Auction Rooms near Chippenham.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/17997949.sex-pistols-first-single-set-sell-thousands-chippenham/"><i>Swindon Advertiser</i>,</a> Hughes said: “I have had the privilege of selling many rare records but this is certainly the most exciting of them all.</p>
      <p>“The Sex Pistols will always be the most iconic punk band, and perhaps also one of the most culturally significant. This is a chance for a collector to own a piece of music history.”</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/anarchy-on-the-big-screen-a-sex-pistols-biopic-is-in-the-works-2466256">that a biopic based on the anarchic career of the Sex Pistols was on the way, following the mammoth success of Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman</a>.</p>
      <p>The 70s punk icons are thought to be the next iconic act to receive the big screen treatment – with UK firm Starlight Films working on the early stages of the biopic for the last 18 months.</p>
      <p>Filmmaker Ayesha Plunkett told <i><a href="http://dailystar.co.uk/">the Daily Star</a></i>: “We were impressed by the box office takings for Bohemian Rhapsody. It only goes to show the public has an appetite for these films.”</p>
