04 Nov 2019, 16:02


Trump’s interjection evoked a mixed reaction online, as while many social media users simply went on to either praise or mock him, others pondered on the nature of his apparent mistweets and the effect they might have on the media.

US President Donald Trump seems to have managed to once again steal the public's attention online with his Twitter antics, taking probably one of his most famous online gaffes, ""Covfefe"",  and boldly thrusting it into the limelight.



​Commenting on a retweeted Daily Caller article about a racehorse named after his ""famous mistweet"" winning a Breeder’s Cup event, Trump inquired whether it was actually a mistweet of perhaps ""something with deep meaning.""
What is the Meaning of This?
Both Trump’s proponents and detractors alike quickly flocked to the president’s tweet, showering him with praise and mocking him, respectively.












Some, however, actually attempted to discern the meaning of Trump’s mistweets.



And others joked about what the media might make of the president’s remark.
