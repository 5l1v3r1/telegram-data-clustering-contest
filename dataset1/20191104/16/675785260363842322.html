      <h1>Liverpool vs Man City referee confirmed ahead of title showdown at Anfield</h1>
      <h2>Michael Oliver will take charge of the Premier League clash at Anfield between unbeaten Liverpool and champions Manchester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:09:47+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Michael Oliver will take charge of this weekend's title showdown between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>The Premier League rivals will face off at Anfield on Sunday in a potentially crucial clash in the race for the title.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are yet to taste defeat this season while champions City are in second, six points adrift of the Reds.</p>
      <p>A win for Jurgen Klopp's side means they could go nine points clear ahead of the festive period.</p>
      <p>The Premier League has confirmed Oliver will take charge at Anfield, with Paul Tierney named as the VAR official.</p>

      <p>Oliver has taken charge of Liverpool twice this season - the wins over Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a>, and was also in the middle for City's controversial draw with Tottenham in August.</p>
      <p>On the back of his controversial officiating in Everton's draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Sunday, Martin Atkinson will be in charge of the clash between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>Atkinson was at the centre of the encounter at Goodison Park after Son Heung-min was shown red for a challenge on Andre Gomes, that led to the midfielder fracturing his ankle.</p>
      <p>Both sides were also denied penalties by controversial VAR calls during the 1-1 draw.</p>
