      <h1>Ryanair dampens expectations on Boeing Max deliveries</h1>

      <p>LONDON - Ryanair says it has dampened expectations that it would receive the entirety of its planned delivery of Boeing 737 Max airplanes next year.</p>
      <p>As the Ireland-headquartered reported profit of 1.15 billion euros ($1.28 billion) for the half-year to September, in line with the same period of 2018, CEO Michael O'Leary said the airline now expects to receive its first Max planes in March 2020.</p>
      <p>O'Leary said Monday that "we have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none."</p>
      <p>Europe's busiest airline has said it would cut flights and close some bases because of delays to deliveries of the plane, which has been grounded globally after two fatal crashes.</p>
