      <p>Members of <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/harry-potter"><i>Harry Potter</i></a>‘s Weasley family have reunited for a selfie at Rhode Island Comic-Con.</p>
      <p>Luna Lovegood actress Evanna Lynch posted a picture of herself with former co-star Bonnie Wright – who played Ginny Weasley – as well as her on-screen siblings James and Oliver Phelps (Fred and George Weasley).</p>
      <p>Captioning the picture, Lynch wrote: “Thanks @ricomiccon for a lovely weekend and a chance to catch up with these jokers!”</p>

      <p>She also revealed that the twins made fun of her selfie stick, while Oliver shared another picture of the four together, joking: “We take this stuff very seriously!”</p>
      <p>Last month, meanwhile, Draco Malfoy actor Tom Felton <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/harry-potter-tom-felton-throwback-video-emma-watson-daniel-radcliffe-2552889">shared a throwback clip</a> of himself with co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, who played Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, on the set of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.</p>
      <p>The clip depicts the stars getting into a competitive game of hand-slapping, Watson writing in the comments: “I’d like to point out that I did go on to win”.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, author JK Rowling sent fans into a frenzy after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jk-rowling-teases-mystery-harry-potter-announcement-2545509">teasing a mysterious new Potter project</a> on her Twitter back in September, sharing an image of Voldemort’s Dark Mark with the caption: “Sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.”</p>
      <p>She included hashtags for <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Cursed Child</i>, suggesting it was some sort of adaptation of the latter stage play, though later retweeted a Twitter moment of a New York Times Square takeover by the show.</p>
