      <p>Picking a starter at the beginning of a new Pokémon<i> </i>game is usually one of the biggest decisions in the entire adventure, so most people want to know what they’re getting into before committing. While <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> aren’t out yet, there are a number of leaks floating around right now — and some of them showcase extremely believable final starter evolutions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The following contains major </b>
        <i>
          <b>Pokemon: Sword and Shield</b>
        </i>
        <b> spoilers, specifically about what these evolutions look like. You’ve been warned.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve already seen the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/11/1/20944379/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leaks-sobble-grookey">middle evolutions through an earlier leak from last week,</a> but a ResetEra thread has popped up with more <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-sword-and-shield-spoiler-leaks-and-datamine-thread-discussion-guidelines-in-op.150651/">images that show what Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble eventually turn into.</a> Out of the three, Grookey probably has the best final design. Look at that mane!</p>

      <p>But then we get to Sobble and Scorbunny, where things get a little weirder. Both the fire and water starters eventually turn into something more human-like. Sobble’s end point in particular is extremely lanky:</p>

      <p>Something about the arms and general proportions throw me off here. But at least it seems like Sobble ends up gaining a little confidence. The final evolution has a little bit of an attitude judging from that side-eye.</p>
      <p>Scorbunny fans might be disappointed to know that the leak doesn’t clarify if the evolution ends up being a fighting type, as is tradition for fire starters in previous games. Unfortunately the image quality for the critter isn’t that great, but you’ll note that this one is also human-like, which is a bit disappointing. There’s something uncanny about having two starters turn into something anthropomorphic.</p>

      <p>Overall, if these turn out to be true, I’m not that impressed with the overall design of this generation’s starters. But where I was once initially leaning toward Scorbunny, Grookey’s final design may have persuaded me to take the plunge and finally do a grass starter instead.</p>
