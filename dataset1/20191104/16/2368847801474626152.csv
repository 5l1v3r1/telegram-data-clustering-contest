中共首次宣布「公安姓黨」 「黨衛隊」呼之欲出

04 Nov 2019, 16:47

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】中共19屆四中全會再次強化「黨管一切」，以維護中共岌岌可危的統治。隨後，公安部部長趙克志即宣布「公安姓黨」，要保衞所謂「社會主義制度安全」。評論人士指，這等於直接宣誓公安是「黨衛隊」。
中共四中全會上週四（10月31日）結束。週五和週六，中共國務委員、公安部部長趙克志接連兩天舉行公安部會議，傳達所謂「四中精神」及「習近平講話」。
趙克志在會議講話中，極力強調所謂「習近平的掌舵領航」、「習近平核心」和「習近平思想」等。
趙克志並要求，公安部要「突出政治建設」，把握「公安姓黨」的「根本政治屬性」，堅持「黨對公安工作的絕對和全方位領導」，同時，要「不斷深化反滲透、反顛覆、反分裂、反邪教、反恐怖鬥爭」，「捍衛黨的執政安全和社會主義制度安全」。
公安機構歷來都是中共的專政工具。但是趙克志首次直接表態「公安姓黨」，「捍衞社會主義制度」，還是引發了輿論關注。有網友建議公安部直接更名「黨安部」。
中共四中全會公報沒有提出如何應對不斷惡化的經濟形勢和民生問題，而是再次強調「黨管一切」，並不斷強化「堅持社會主義制度」。外界擔心，處於內憂外患中的中共，可能會繼續通過加強社會管制來維護政權。中共公然宣布「公安姓黨」，或意味著對民眾的打壓迫害將再一次升級。
北京異見人士胡佳對自由亞洲表示，公安部這種赤裸的表態，一方面是向習近平表忠，一方面也相當於宣布自己扮演的是中共鷹犬的「黨衛隊」角色，中國恐將進入更加瘋狂的抓捕時代。
「八九學潮」前學生領袖吾爾開希指出，「公安姓黨」 是一個可怕的口號，它公然踐踏「司法獨立」這一現代國家文明準則。這顯示當局明確的要把中國帶向一個「法西斯統治時期」。
流亡加拿大的中國維權律師祝聖武表示，其實「公安姓黨」早已是事實，以黨的意志為最高原則的公安機關，可以公然知法犯法，甚至殺人放火、活摘器官以及建立新疆集中營，因此也是中國惡劣人權紀錄的主要炮製者。
近年來，已經有越來越多的中共政府機構宣布「姓黨」，包括「黨校姓黨」、「軍報姓黨」、「央視姓黨」等等。
除了政府機構，中共也對私營企業加強管控，不但強制要求私企設立黨委，甚至公然向私企派駐官員，或者接管私企財務。因此，連私有財產也有「姓黨」的趨勢。

The CCP first announced the ""public security surname party"" and ""the SS""

04 Nov 2019, 16:47

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee once again strengthened the ""party management"" to maintain the precarious rule of the CCP. Subsequently, the Minister of Public Security, Zhao Kezhi, announced that the ""Public Security Names Party"" should defend the so-called ""social system security."" Commentators said that this is tantamount to directly swearing that the public security is the ""party guard.""
The Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party ended last Thursday (October 31). On Friday and Saturday, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi held a meeting of the Ministry of Public Security for two days to convey the so-called ""Four Spirits"" and ""Xi Jinping's speech.""
In his speech at the meeting, Zhao Kezhi strongly emphasized the so-called ""Xi Jinping's steering at the helm"", ""Xi Jinping's core"" and ""Xi Jinping's thought"".
Zhao Kezhi also requested that the Ministry of Public Security should ""emphasize political construction"", grasp the ""fundamental political attributes"" of the ""public security surnamed party"", adhere to ""the party's absolute and all-round leadership of public security work"", and at the same time, ""continue to deepen anti-infiltration, ""Anti-subversion, anti-secession, anti-cult, anti-terrorism struggle"", ""defending the party's ruling security and the security of the socialist system.""
Public security agencies have always been the dictatorship tools of the CCP. However, for the first time, Zhao Kezhi directly stated that ""the public security name is the party"" and ""defending the socialist system"" has caused public concern. Some netizens suggested that the Ministry of Public Security directly renamed the ""Party Security Department.""
The communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party did not propose how to deal with the deteriorating economic situation and people's livelihood issues. Instead, it emphasized ""the party manages everything"" and continuously strengthened the ""adherence to the socialist system."" The outside world is worried that the CCP, which is in internal and external troubles, may continue to maintain its political power by strengthening social regulation. The CCP’s open declaration of ""public security surnamed the party"" may mean that the suppression of the people will be escalated again.
Hu Jia, a dissident in Beijing, told Freedom Asia that the naked position of the Ministry of Public Security is on the one hand to loyalty to Xi Jinping, and on the other hand to the role of the ""Party Guard"" of the CCP's hawk dog. China is likely to enter a more crazy position. The era of arrest.
The former student leader of the ""Eight Nine Schools"", Wu Erkai, pointed out that ""the police surnamed the party"" is a terrible slogan. It blatantly tramples on the ""judicial independence"", the modern national civilization norm. This shows that the authorities clearly want to bring China to a ""fascist period.""
Zhu Shengwu, a Chinese human rights lawyer in exile in Canada, said that in fact, the ""public security surname party"" is already a fact. The public security organs with the party's will as the highest principle can openly know the law and commit crimes, even killing people, setting fire to organs, and establishing Xinjiang concentration camps. The main concoct of human rights records.
In recent years, more and more Chinese government agencies have announced ""name of the party"", including ""party school name party"", ""military newspaper surname party"", ""CCTV surname party"" and so on.
In addition to government agencies, the CCP has also strengthened control over private companies. It not only requires private companies to set up party committees, but even publicly assigns officials to private companies or takes over private-sector finance. Therefore, even private property also has a tendency to ""name the party.""
