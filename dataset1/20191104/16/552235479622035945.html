      <p>Police have appealed for information this afternoon in the search for missing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> man Darren Sadler.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old was last seen on Long Walk Place at around 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Darren is believed to have driven away from Long Walk Place in a navy blue <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/audi">Audi A6</a> , registration E2 DBS.</p>
      <p>He is described as 6ft 4in tall with short grey/white hair and was wearing a t-shirt, grey trousers and black Sketcher trainers.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Michael Stobie, of Mastrick community policing team, said: "Darren has never <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/missing-people">gone missing</a> before so his disappearance is out of character for him.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"We have been carrying out enquiries however we're now appealing for the public's help to trace him.</p>
      <p>"Similarly if Darren reads our appeal, please contact us or your family to let people know you are okay."</p>
      <p>If anyone has seen Darren, his car or has any information about his disappearance, please call 101 quoting incident number 3399 of 3 November 2019.</p>
