      <p>NEW YORK (Nov 4): Technology stocks pushed Wall Street's three main indexes to record highs on Monday, as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and an improving domestic economy boosted risk appetite.</p>
      <p>Washington and Beijing said on Friday that they had made progress in defusing an economically damaging trade war, with U.S. officials indicatinga deal could be signed this month.</p>
      <p>Adding to the upbeat mood, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday licenses for U.S. companies to sell components to China's Huawei Technologies Co would come "very shortly".</p>
      <p>Eight of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were higher, with the energy sector gaining the most as oil prices rose, while technology shares provided the biggest boost on the back of a rally in trade-sensitive chip stocks.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index touched a fresh record high, with the index last up 1.4%.</p>
      <p>"There is growing enthusiasm over a trade deal, as progress is being made in these talks," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.</p>
      <p>"Investors are betting that some sort of a deal is on its way, not a whole deal but something that will at least avoid a recession. And markets can live with that," he added.</p>
      <p>The third-quarter earnings season has been a key driver for the markets, with 76% of the 360 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far beating profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Investors also took comfort from data on Friday that showed U.S. jobs growth slowed less than expected in October.</p>
      <p>A report on Monday, however, showed new orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in September and business spending on equipment was slightly weaker than initially thought, suggesting that manufacturing remains soft, amid the ongoing trade war.</p>
      <p>At 10:11 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 131.44 points or 0.48% at 27,478.80; the S&amp;P 500 was up 13.58 points or 0.44% at 3,080.49; and the Nasdaq Composite was up 44.55 points or 0.53% at 8,430.95.</p>
      <p>The biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow Jones index was a 2.6% drop in shares of McDonald's Corp, after the fast-food giant dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.</p>
      <p>Under Armour Inc fell 14.6% as it lowered its full-year revenue forecast for a second straight time, a day after it confirmed a federal probe related to its accounting practices.</p>
      <p>In M&amp;A activity, medical device maker Stryker Corp said it would buy smaller rival Wright Medical Group for about US$4 billion in cash. Shares in Wright Medical surged 29.6%, while Stryker fell 4.1%.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.10-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.06-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 52 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 101 new highs and 13 new lows.</p>
