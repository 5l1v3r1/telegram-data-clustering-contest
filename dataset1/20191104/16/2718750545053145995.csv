Jesus Is King Makes Kanye West King of the Charts
04 Nov 2019, 16:59 by Justin Curto
Looks like releasing the album 12 hours late didn’t hurt Kanye West. Jesus Is King debuted atop the Billboard 200, tying the record for most consecutive No. 1 debuts as the rapper’s ninth in a row. Only his first album, The College Dropout, didn’t make it — it entered the charts at a measly No. 2. In Kanye’s company, the only other artist with nine consecutive No. 1’s is Eminem, whose 2018 album Kamikaze gave him the record at the time. But what does Kanye have that Eminem doesn’t? Another album planned before the end of the year — if we can trust him to get it out on time. Hey, maybe the promise of a record for the self-proclaimed “greatest artist of all time” could be some good motivation.
