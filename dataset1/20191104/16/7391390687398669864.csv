12 Thanksgiving 2019 Movies To See After You’ve Cleared The Table

04 Nov 2019, 16:00

Somehow, 2019 is almost over and the holiday season is nearly here. More importantly, this is also the season when a lot of highly anticipated movies and awards contenders come out. If you're someone who likes to chase your stuffing and pumpkin pie with a trip to the theater, you'll want to know which movies are coming out this Thanksgiving, so you have your post-dinner plans in place.
To be clear, these are not movies about Thanksgiving, but rather movies that hit cinemas at this magical time of year... a time of year that's full of both food and chances to say things like, ""I think she'll at least get a nomination.""
Now, depending on who you're going to the movies with, deciding which film you're going to see could be simple or complicated. Need to take your nieces and nephews out? Frozen 2 will be a better pick than Doctor Sleep. Going with a few hometown friends? The options are more wide open. Want to be by yourself at cry for a while? Tom Hanks just so happens to be playing Mister Rogers.
Whether you celebrate Thanksgiving or not — or need to flee annoying family members or not — here are 12 movies you can choose from for all your end of November viewing needs.
1. Harriet

2. Last Christmas

3. Midway

Another one for history buffs, Midway is about the eponymous World War II battle fought in the sky and at sea. It stars Ed Skrein, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Wilson, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid, and Luke Evans and is helmed by Roland Emmerich.

Warner Bros. Pictures on YouTube
Nearly 40 years after its release, The Shining has an official film sequel. (The Stephen King followup novel was published in 2013.) Doctor Sleep stars Ewan McGregor as an adult version of Danny Torrance, the kid from the original film. Obviously, creepy stuff is still happening.
