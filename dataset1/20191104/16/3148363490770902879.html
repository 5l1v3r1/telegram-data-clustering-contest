      <h2>A suspect who allegedly threw battery acid into another man’s face in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Friday has been arrested.</h2>

      <p>The victim, 42-year-old Mahud Villalaz, <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-suspect-allegedly-throws-battery-acid-on-man-in-racial-attack/29673827">said</a> the man argued with him about how his truck was parked as they were standing outside a restaurant on South 13th Street between Cleveland and Harrison avenues.</p>
      <p>“Because I was parked wrong. I’m going to my truck, and I move it half a block there. Then I get out to go to the restaurant, and the guy’s still there with a bottle in his hands,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage released by the restaurant shows the 61-year-old suspect throwing the acid into Villalaz’s face, who then turns and walks out of view.</p>

      <p>“It started burning really bad. I started go screaming for help to the restaurant,” he <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2019/11/04/suspect-arrested-throwing-acid-milwaukee-man-alleged-hate-crime/">said</a>. “I don’t want this guy near my kids, my family or anything like that.”</p>
      <p>Villalaz, who is a U.S. citizen, claimed the man called him an “illegal,” and added that “I think I pissed him off because I told him, ‘This is my country. This isn’t your country. Everybody came from somewhere else here.'”</p>
      <p>Following the attack, Villalaz was taken to a nearby hospital and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/milwaukee-police-make-arrest-suspected-hate-crime-after-man-attacked-n1075961">treated</a> for second-degree burns. He was released soon after.</p>
      <p>The victim’s family <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2019/11/02/milwaukee-battery-acid-attack-man-burned-police-looking-suspect/4140669002/">thanked</a> local authorities for quickly finding the man and taking him into custody.</p>
      <p>“We wish to thank Chief Alfonso Morales and all the professionals at the Milwaukee Police Department for their efforts in bringing the attacker to justice,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>Villalaz said he is a victim of a hate crime because of how the man approached him.</p>
      <p>“This is pretty much a terrorist attack,” he stated, adding “Thank God he didn’t have a gun and shoot me.”</p>
      <p>Police said the suspect is accused of aggravated battery but no other details have been released so far.</p>
      <p>In a press release Saturday, Milwaukee Alderman Jose Perez urged the community to find common ground so as to avoid instances like the one that occurred on Friday.</p>
      <p>“This was senseless violence and it needs to stop. We as a community need to come together to work through our differences and learn to respect one another and defuse conflict,” he said.</p>
