      <p>Officers investigating the incident are now appealing for witnesses, and anyone who can help the investigation is asked to come forward.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Paul Mooney of Lanarkshire CID said: “This has been a very frightening experience for the staff members working within the store who have understandably been left shaken by the incident.</p>
      <p>“The man left the area on foot and we are keen to hear from anyone who was in Fleming Way or the surrounding area on Sunday evening and who saw him, to report this to officers.</p>
