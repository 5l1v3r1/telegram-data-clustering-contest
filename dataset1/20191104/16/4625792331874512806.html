      <h1>Seth Meyers’ new comedy special will include button to skip over Trump jokes</h1>

      <p>Netflix announced the next comedy special from Seth Meyers would include an <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">option</a></u> to skip over the jokes about President Trump.</p>
      <p>Meyers, 45, jokes about the president in most of his <i>Late Night </i>monologues but wanted to include an option in his stand-up special to allow people to skip his bits on Trump.</p>
      <p>He explained that he knows many comedy fans are tired of only hearing jokes about Trump and realized that airing his special on Netflix gave viewers the opportunity to bypass his political jokes while enjoying the remainder of his show.</p>
      <p>"It dawned on me that because it was on Netflix, there would be this opportunity to put in technology that would allow people to skip it," Meyers explained in an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">interview</a> with CNN Business. "It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, 'Oh, let me guess there's going to be jokes about the president.'"</p>
      <p>Meyers said the button is a joke in itself because so many people have burned out on hearing about Trump.</p>
      <p>"I'm burned out from some politicians," he stated. "But, I'm not burned out on politics."</p>
      <p>Meyers said he doesn’t believe many people will actually opt to skip the Trump bits, joking, “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they'll put parsley on your plate, and you'll think, 'Well, that's a nice touch,' but you're not going to eat the parsley."</p>
      <p>Meyers’ special <i>Lobby Baby</i> will be available on Netflix on Tuesday.</p>
