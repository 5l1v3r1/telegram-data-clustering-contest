      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">UK</a> lowered its national terrorism threat level to "substantial" from "severe" on Monday, the country's interior minister Priti Patel said.</p>
      <p>"Despite the change in the threat level, terrorism remains one of the most direct and immediate risks to our national security," Patel said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The "substantial" threat level continued to indicate a high level of threat and an attack might well occur without further warning, she said.</p>
