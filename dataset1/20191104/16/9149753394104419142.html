      <p>Walmart is rolling back the price on a Lenovo Legion Y545 gaming laptop. This gaming laptop deal on the Legion has it <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Laptop-Hexa-Core-Processor-RAM-i7-9750H-PCIe-Black-Intel-GeForce-Nvidia-6GB-Y545-RTX-16GB-Core-Lenovo-81Q6000QUS-Card-SSD-2060-Graphics-512GB-Storage/560161624">down to $1,199</a> from its regular $1,599 price. That's a tidy $400 saving for you, and is likely to be a deal that beats many of the forthcoming Black Friday offers. If you've been holding out, now may be the time to pull the money-trigger.</p>
      <p>This Legion Y545 (81Q6000QUS) comes with an Intel Core i7-9750H Hexa-Core processor, RTX 2060, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD storage. The RTX 2060 should a very solid gameplay experience on the 144Hz display with medium to high presets. </p>
      <p>We would have loved to see at least 1TB SSD storage and a better-positioned webcam that won't provide such unflattering angles. No one wants to look up your nose during a Discord video chat. Aside from that, it's a very solid laptop. The design itself is pretty subtle, and not as obnoxious as some of the chunky gaming laptops out there, so that's a real bonus. </p>
