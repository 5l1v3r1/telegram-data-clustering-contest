【2,500元學生津貼】財政司司長陳茂波於2019年8月公布的紓困措施中，建議為中學日校、小學和幼稚園學生提供一次性2,500元的學生學習津貼，並不設入息審查。行政長官林鄭月娥亦於新一份《施政報告》中提出由2020/21學年起將學習津貼恆常化。

學生津貼將銀行轉賬至家長戶口
據教育局早前向立法會提交文件顯示，教育局建議透過學校派發申請表格及核實學生身份，申請人亦可從網上下載表格或到各區域教育服務處索取。教育局表示會盡量簡化申請和審批程序，屆時津貼將透過銀行轉賬至家長戶口。教育局期望，本學年的款項將在財委會通過撥款審批後，約6星期開始接受申請，並於收到申請後約6星期逐步發放津貼，往後料每年11月發放。
