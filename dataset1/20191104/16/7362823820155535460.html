      <p>“I love the ages that my kids are at,” the HGTV star explained. “My son just turned 4, we play video games together, we wrestle! We’re homies, you know? When we hang out with our babies, they’re cute and stuff but you can’t do all the things you can do when they get a little bit older.”</p>
