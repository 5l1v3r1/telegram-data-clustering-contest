      <p>He also revealed that he is no longer in touch with former bandmate Zayn Malik, who he said “didn’t even say goodbye” when he quit in 2015.</p>

      <p>Asked if there were still grudges between the five singers, Payne said: “Definitely in some part, yeah.</p>
      <p>“We had our differences throughout the whole experience with some things.</p>
      <p>“I still think about some stuff that was said and done that now I would do differently, but then that’s all part of growing up...Being in One Direction was such a schoolyard mentality somehow – the One Direction University, I call it.”</p>
      <p>He went on: “Everyone has stuff they’ve said at parties they wished they hadn’t but, for us, the difference was that it was all happening in front of the world.</p>
      <p>“Now we are older, for me certainly there are things that I am just not as bothered about.”</p>
      <blockquote>Being in One Direction was such a schoolyard mentality somehow – the One Direction University, I call it</blockquote>
      <p>Discussing Malik leaving, Payne said: “We haven’t really heard from him since he left.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t even say goodbye, if I am being honest.</p>
      <p>“It was a really sordid scenario, from our side certainly. A bit strange. It’s difficult.”</p>
      <p>Payne is now gearing up for the release of his debut album, which he said has taken two or three years and has been a “difficult” process.</p>
      <p>“I mean, it’s opening up at first and trying to figure out who you are and what people want to know from you,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And what the sound is. Trying to find that medium point for all those things.</p>
      <p>“It’s just the most difficult thing, especially at a young age when you’re constantly changing and you don’t really know yourself yet.”</p>

      <p>The star continued: “We spent the best part of five years in a band closed off from the world and I had to go through this really weird transition inside that band as the world, and then myself, came out of it.</p>
      <p>“I mean, even in my therapy sessions, my therapist asked me, ‘What do you actually like to do?’ And I’m like, ‘ don’t know what I like doing!’”</p>
      <p>The full interview is available online now via GQ Hype.</p>
