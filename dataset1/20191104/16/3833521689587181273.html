      <h1>Record short VIX positioning reflects a ton of fear elsewhere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:46:06+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Kawa</a></address>
      <p>Bearish bets on stock volatility are close to a record high, raising investor concern that the market is ripe for turmoil. There’s a more benign explanation.</p>
      <p>Futures linked to the measure of S&amp;P 500’s implied volatility, known as the “fear gauge,” tend to move inversely to equities. The net non-commercial position — long contracts outstanding less short positions — sank to minus 187,948 last week, its lowest level ever.</p>
      <p>If speculators are net short, somebody else must be net long. And some of the exchange-traded products used by retail investors are reflecting exactly that. Shares outstanding in three such offerings (VXX, UVXY and TVIX) are all at record highs. The iPath Series B S&amp;P 500 VIX short-term futures ETN (VXX) is the second itinerant of this note, and was launched in 2018.</p>
      <p>“Retail builds up a big position and that’s reflected in the term structure. Speculators have the other side,” said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors. “It’s the wrong interpretation to say a big speculative VIX net-short position necessarily means it’s a good time to be long.”</p>

      <p>Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo, added that the shape of the curve is often used as a guide for speculative positioning. The steep contango — which reflects higher uncertainty about the medium-term outlook for volatility relative to the near term — encourages increased exposure to a short-vol trade.</p>
      <p>While the sheer size of shorts is elevated, it’s still below the 2019 peak and well off levels that prevailed before the Feb. 5 volatility explosion. This entails there’s less that would need to be covered in the event of a meaningful market tumult.</p>
      <p>If there’s a reason for caution regarding S&amp;P 500 options, it’s that they may be reflecting greed rather than complacency, according to analysts. One example is that a gauge of investors’ demand for options that offer protection against 10 per cent downside versus (90-110 one-month put-call skew) has crated since early October to near its lows of the year.</p>
