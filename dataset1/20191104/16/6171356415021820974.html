      <h1>Get a Fire TV Stick 4K and a third-gen Echo Dot for $70 ($10 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:00:10+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/hagop-kavafian/" target="_blank">Hagop Kavafian</a></address>
      <p>If you're thinking of making your home smarter, cost can sometimes be a roadblock. Thankfully, you can save $10 on an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K bundle together with a third-generation Echo Dot speaker, paying just under $70 for both. With this combination, you'll be able to control your TV only by shouting at your smart speaker and without even lifting a finger.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Stick 4K will let you stream content in Ultra HD quality for a fully immersive experience. Unfortunately, the speaker is the simplest Echo Dot, which doesn't feature the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/25/amazon-announces-new-echo-high-end-echo-studio-and-more-speakers/">new LED clock</a>. It's still more than enough to help you out with common queries and control your TV. If you'd rather stay quiet, the Fire TV Stick 4K also comes with a remote, which can be convenient if you're watching a movie at night and need to pause it.</p>
      <p>To get your bundle, just use the link below to purchase it on Amazon. The price is already discounted, and there's no need for a coupon code to enjoy the markdown.</p>
