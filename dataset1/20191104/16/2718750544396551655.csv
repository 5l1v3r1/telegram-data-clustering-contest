Seth Meyers’s Netflix Special Features a Handy Button to Skip the Trump Jokes
04 Nov 2019, 16:27 by Megh Wright
If you agree that Donald Trump is one of the worst things to ever happen to comedy, then your priority when you fire up Netflix to watch a stand-up special probably isn’t a bunch of Trump jokes. Seth Meyers has decided to riff on this in a creative way for his debut Netflix special, Lobby Baby, taking a cue from the choose-your-own-adventure technology of Bandersnatch to allow viewers the option to skip over his politics and Trump material entirely.
According to CNN, Lobby Baby — which debuts on Netflix tomorrow — includes a moment where Meyers shifts from personal to political jokes that features a “Skip Politics” button, where viewers can click past that portion of the set similar to the “Skip Intro” button at the opening of shows on the streaming network. “It dawned on me that because it was on Netflix, there would be this opportunity to put in technology that would allow people to skip it,” Meyers told CNN on the stunt. “It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, ‘Oh, let me guess there’s going to be jokes about the president.’”
For Meyers, the “Skip Politics” button is not intended to be taken seriously and is just a way of using the Netflix format to fit in a new kind of joke. “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, Well, that’s a nice touch,” he said, “but you’re not going to eat the parsley.”
