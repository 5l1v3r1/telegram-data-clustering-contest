      <p>“It was officially closed by the Kerian district officer who is also the the district disaster management chairman, at 9.45am today, after remaining open since Oct 26,” he said.</p>
      <p>The relief centre at SK Changkat Lobak in Kerian district which had earlier housed 149 flood victims from 35 families, was also closed today, he added.</p>
