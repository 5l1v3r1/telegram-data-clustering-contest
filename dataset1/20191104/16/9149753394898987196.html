      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is getting 38 more maps, according to a leak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:58:01+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> players look like they might become inundated with maps. Senescallo leaked the alleged map list on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dqgzml/38_upcoming_multiplayer_maps_in_modern_warfare/">Reddit</a> over the weekend, though there's no indication when and in what order they'll arrive. </p>
      <p>That's twice the number of maps that are already available, so it's huge leap and thus probably not likely to be dumped on players all at once. It would likely be a bit of a nightmare to test them all, too. </p>
      <p>It's not clear how the returning maps will be adapted for the new Modern Warfare, but seeing as how the pace and structure of multiplayer has been tweaked a bit since their previous appearance, it may be that we're in for more than just a shiny coat of paint. </p>

      <p>Another dataminer has managed to dig up details of new modes. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/That1MiningGuy/status/1190540885219577856">That1MiningGuy</a>, Capture the Flag is returning to Modern Warfare, and there are references to zombies and possibly a battle royale mode. Several lines contain the "br" abbreviation.</p>
      <p>Lots of new <a href="https://twitter.com/That1MiningGuy/status/1190642670105968643">emblems</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/That1MiningGuy/status/1190693442684358656">operator skins</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/That1MiningGuy/status/1190701704368578561">weapon skins</a> have also been unearthed. There's a lot to root through. </p>
