      <h1><i>Jesus Is King</i> Makes Kanye West King of the Charts</h1>

      <p>Looks like <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/listen-kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king.html">releasing the album 12 hours late</a> didn’t hurt Kanye West. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-album-review.html"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a> debuted atop the Billboard 200, tying the record for most consecutive No. 1 debuts as the rapper’s ninth in a row. Only his first album, <i>The College Dropout</i>, didn’t make it — it entered the charts at a measly No. 2. In Kanye’s company, the only other artist with nine consecutive No. 1’s is Eminem, whose 2018 album <i>Kamikaze </i>gave him the record at the time. But what does Kanye have that Eminem doesn’t? <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-born.html">Another album planned before the end of the year</a> — if we can trust him to get it out on time. Hey, maybe the promise of a record for the self-proclaimed “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-50178788">greatest artist</a> of all time” could be some good motivation.</p>
