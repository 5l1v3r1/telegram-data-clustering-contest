      <p>POLICE in Vietnam have arrested eight people in connection with the deaths of 39 migrants in a lorry container in Essex.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 31 men and eight women were found in a container at an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of October 23.</p>
      <p>Two men from Co Armagh and Co Down are facing manslaughter charges over the 39 deaths.</p>
      <p>Police in Northern Ireland and Essex are also searching for two Co Armagh brothers in connection with the investigation.</p>
      <p>Essex Police initially believed all the victims were Chinese. However, it is understood all 39 were from Vietnam and were travelling on fake Chinese passports.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for police in Vietnam said most of the victims were from the neighbouring provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, on the country's north central coast.</p>
      <p>The provinces are known for their high levels of migration.</p>
      <p>On Friday, police in Ha Tinh said they had arrested two people and summoned others for questioning on suspicion of involvement in trafficking.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the deaths a "serious humanitarian tragedy".</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a remembrance service for the victims was held at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in Bow, east London, which has a large Vietnamese congregation.</p>
      <p>Reverend Simon Nguyen told the PA news agency that the church has assisted with the investigation into the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Maurice 'Mo' Robinson (25), of Laurelvale, Co Armagh, has already appeared in court in England over the 39 deaths.</p>
      <p>He is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Essex Police have also started extradition proceedings to bring 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, from Mayobridge in Co Down, to the UK.</p>
      <p>Mr Harrison appeared in the High Court in Dublin on Friday. He is facing charges including 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences.</p>
      <p>Detectives have also urged Ronan Hughes (40) and his brother Christopher (34) to hand themselves in.</p>
      <p>The pair, from Co Armagh, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>It is understood Ronan Hughes spoke to police shortly after the driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, was arrested following the discovery of the bodies.</p>
