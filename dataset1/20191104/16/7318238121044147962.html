      <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Lima on Sunday (November 3) to call for an end to bullfighting at the start of the country's most high-profile bullfighting event, the Feria Taurina del Senor de los Milagros.</p>
      <p>Protesters heckled fans entering a bullfighting ring, with tensions spilling over into scuffles. Protesters say the bloody sport causes excessive suffering for the animals as bulls fight to the death against matadors.</p>
      <p>Bullfighting was introduced into Latin America by the Spaniards and Portuguese. However, parts of Spain and Portugal have already outlawed the practice.</p>
