      <p>NAPERVILLE, Ill. -- Buffalo Wild Wings says multiple employees have been fired at one of its suburban Chicago restaurants after a group of mostly African American customers said they were asked to move to another table because of their skin colour.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/ct-nvs-naperville-buffalo-wild-wings-employees-terminated-st-1104-20191104-doprfxa5c5bvbnum2a4e74vb5y-story.html">The Naperville Sun reports</a> Buffalo Wild Wings spokeswoman Claire Kudlata said Sunday the company conducted a thorough internal investigation and "terminated the employees involved."</p>
      <p>Kudlata said via email that the company "has zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind."</p>
      <p>Justin Vahl of Montgomery says he was celebrating a birthday last month with children and adults at the Naperville restaurant when a host asked about his ethnicity.</p>
      <p>Vahl says a manager later asked his group to move because a regular customer didn't want to sit near black people. They left for another restaurant after several managers tried to move them.</p>
