      <p>A barge grounded in shallow rapids near Niagara Falls moved for the first time in more than 100 years during a storm last week â€“ before getting stuck again.</p>
      <p>TV station WGRZ said the rusty iron boat had been stuck since 1918 on rocks in the upper rapids above the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.</p>
      <p>High winds and rain last Thursday dislodged it before it became trapped again.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post said it was originally about a third of a mile from the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Then it moved about 164 feet downstream and became lodged again.</p>
      <p>Niagara Parks officials are monitoring the vessel and said it could be stuck in its new location for days or years.</p>
