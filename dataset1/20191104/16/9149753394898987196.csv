Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is getting 38 more maps, according to a leak
04 Nov 2019, 16:58 by Fraser Brown
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare players look like they might become inundated with maps. Senescallo leaked the alleged map list on Reddit over the weekend, though there's no indication when and in what order they'll arrive. 
That's twice the number of maps that are already available, so it's huge leap and thus probably not likely to be dumped on players all at once. It would likely be a bit of a nightmare to test them all, too. 
It's not clear how the returning maps will be adapted for the new Modern Warfare, but seeing as how the pace and structure of multiplayer has been tweaked a bit since their previous appearance, it may be that we're in for more than just a shiny coat of paint. 
Check out the full list below: 

Gunfight


Cage
Cargo 
Hook
Exclusion Zone
Shoot House


6v6 and 10v10


Aniyah Tac
Crash
Dam
Krovnik Farmland
Gulag
Hospital
Layover
Lowline
Lumber
Malyshev
Milbase
Oasis
Port
Prison

Another dataminer has managed to dig up details of new modes. According to That1MiningGuy, Capture the Flag is returning to Modern Warfare, and there are references to zombies and possibly a battle royale mode. Several lines contain the ""br"" abbreviation.
Lots of new emblems, operator skins and weapon skins have also been unearthed. There's a lot to root through. 
Cheers, Dexerto.
