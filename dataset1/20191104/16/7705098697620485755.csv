After a dishonorable discharge from military school and years of brutal survival training, Kate returns home when the Alice in Wonderland gang targets her father and his security firm, by kidnapping his best Crow officer Sophie Moore (Meagan Tandy). Although remarried to wealthy socialite Catherine Hamilton-Kane (Elizabeth Anweis), who bankrolls the Crows, Jacob still struggles with the family he lost, while keeping Kate — the daughter he still has — at a distance.
Based on the characters from DC, Batwoman comes from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television with executive producers Greg Berlanti, Caroline Dries, as well as Geoff Johns, and Sarah Schechter. Additionally, David Nutter and Marcos Siega executive produced the pilot.
