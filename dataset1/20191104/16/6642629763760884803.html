      <p>The British pound held near the day's lows on Monday with investors' attention focused on political developments as election campaigning gets under way.</p>
      <p>The British currency drifted down 0.1 percent against the dollar and euro.</p>
      <p>UK PMI data showed that construction shrank for the sixth month in a row in October. The data was in line with expectations and reflected a slowdown in growth due to political uncertainty before UK Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a>'s now-defunct October 31 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> deadline.</p>
      <p>The pound was little changed by the data, last trading at $1.2915, holding below the $1.30 benchmark hit nearly two weeks ago. Versus the euro, sterling was down 0.1 percent at 86.39 pence.</p>
      <p>"The data is irrelevant compared to the political election campaign we've got under way," said Jordan Rochester, FX strategist at Nomura, who noted that weaker-than-expected Spanish PMI data on Monday weakened the euro, which strengthened the dollar, and thus capped sterling.</p>
      <p>With just over five weeks until the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> heads to the polls on December 12, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/conservative-party.html">Conservative Party</a> is leading in the polls and the risk of a "no-deal" Brexit is considered to have been reduced.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Johnson said that the transition period after the UK leaves the European Union would not be extended beyond December 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party's leader Nigel Farage said on Sunday that he would not stand in the election, choosing instead to campaign against Johnson's EU divorce deal.</p>
      <p>Sterling-dollar implied volatility gauges with a one-month maturity, which fell in October, have started to rise again.</p>
      <p>"It's too early to say who's going to win and, given that uncertainty, foreign investors will hold back from being overweight UK assets," Rochester said, suggesting that polling was not a reliable indicator as around a fifth of British voters would not have decided who to vote for yet.</p>
      <h3>Reduced shorts</h3>
      <p>Leveraged funds that bet on the direction of sterling reduced their short positions on the pound in the week to October 29 to $2.606bn, a six-month low, according to CFTC data on Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>This means that there was a reduction in the expectation that the pound will fall.</p>
      <p>Still, those levels showed that market participants remained negative overall on sterling, leaving the market vulnerable to a squeeze higher in the event of any favourable news.</p>
      <p>"The dynamics are reflecting the sharp decline in the perceived odds of a hard Brexit and the subsequent weaker catalysts for a possible GBP decline," ING FX strategists Francesco Pesole and Petr Krpata wrote in a note to clients.</p>
      <p>"The possible changes in polls that would indicate a higher probability of a hung parliament would likely lead to some renewed build-up of sterling shorts," they said.</p>
      <p>"In our view, this indicates that GBP will less and less benefit from that short-squeezing effect that has been exacerbating upside moves in the past weeks."</p>
