A Florida woman eight-months pregnant used an AR-15 to fatally shoot a burglar when her family was reportedly attacked by home intruders.
According to WPLG , two men broke into the family's home in Lithia, just south of Tampa, on Wednesday.
WPLG reports that after telling the men he had no money, Jeremy King was beaten by the men and suffered a fractured eye socket, fractured sinus cavity and a concussion. The men also allegedly grabbed his 11-year-old daughter.
When King's wife went to find out what was going on, one of the burglars shot at her, causing her to retreat. When she returned to the room, she was carrying an AR-15 and returned fire.
WPLG is reporting that the woman shot at the men as they ran from the home. One of the men was found dead in a nearby ditch, while the other is still at large.
