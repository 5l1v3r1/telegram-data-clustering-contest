      <h1>VIDEO: Five Used Car Salesmen Killed in Mexican Cartel Attack</h1>
      <h2>A group of cartel gunmen stormed an open-air market in a Mexican coastal state, killing five used car salesmen. The attack suggests an extortion attempt as cartels continue to terrorize communities in Michoacán.</h2>

      <p>The attack took place at an open-air market near the Macarena Events Center in Uruapan, where various individuals sell used cars. Locals claimed a group of gunmen in several SUVs arrived at the scene and began shooting, causing mass panic among those in attendance. The gunmen shot five men at the event.</p>

      <p>According to a prepared statement by the Michoacán Attorney General’s Office, the victims are identified as Ramon and Jose Antonio V. (father and son), Jose Luis S., Alfredo S., and Saul C. The statement notes a sixth victim was seriously injured and sent to a hospital. State officials have not publicly discussed the incident; however, the mass shooting follows one day after Michoacán Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo met with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau and promoted improvements to the state’s security apparatus.</p>

      <p>In the weeks before the shooting, locals spoke out about extortion attempts from a cell of Los Viagras Cartel led by Angel “El Camaleon” Chaves Ponce. <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/10/30/crossdressing-mexican-cartel-leader-rescued-from-custody-officials-deny-incident/">Chaves Ponce is the same drug lord who, in recent days, was behind a series of blockades and torched vehicles in Santa Clara del Cobre</a> by his gunmen as part of a rescue attempt. Despite the widespread chaos at the time, officials downplayed in the incident.</p>
