[Credit Card Tax Discount 2019] Citi is the first to push credit card tax payment. Earn tax rebate 600 yuan!
04 Nov 2019, 16:25 by Finance
Credit card tax offers are first introduced by Citibank! Taxpayers have received tax returns from October onwards, and are ready to pay taxes for the first phase of January. I hope that half of the grain at the end of the year will not evaporate directly. It is necessary to pay attention to the tax payment offered by various banks. Citibank today (November 4th) launched an early tax payment for CitiVisa credit card customers, with a maximum rebate of up to 600 yuan! It is believed that other banks will also introduce tax payment concessions before the end of the year. The ""Economic Week"" will be continuously updated for everyone. Please pay close attention to the tax concessions of future banks.
