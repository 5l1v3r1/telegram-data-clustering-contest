      <p>Has there been enough of a gap that you could head back into <i>Super Mario Odyssey </i>and experience it with mostly fresh eyes? I think I'm about at that point. Some key moments in the game – a certain musical number, a world fueled by pure nostalgia, and a painful gauntlet – will have lost their original impact, but otherwise? The rest feels like a blur. I'm ready to play this precious adventure again.</p>
      <p>If and when that time comes for you, it might be worth picking up <i>The Art of Super Mario Odyssey</i> to supplement your playthrough. Following its release in Japan <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../-the-art-of-super-mario-odyssey-will-be-released-this-month-in-japan-520725.phtml">last year</a>, the English-language version of the book is finally out this week in North America courtesy of Dark Horse. I didn't end up importing it.</p>

      <p>The 368-page art book goes on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Super-Mario-Odyssey/dp/1506713750">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-art-of-super-mario-odyssey-nintendo/1130879603?ean=9781506713755#/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> starting November 5. It'll normally cost $49.99, but right now, retailers have it for $34.99. An early Christmas present, perhaps. (Just in case Santa's helpers are reading, I have an extra-wide stocking to accommodate cool gifts like this.)</p>
      <p>Along with concept art, sketches, and notes, <i>The Art of Super Mario Odyssey </i>offers "insight into some early ideas that didn't make it into the game itself." One high-profile example: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../what-are-the-odds-princess-bowser-concept-spotted-in-new-mario-art-book-524907.phtml">Bowsette</a>.</p>
      <p>I sincerely hope Nintendo explores some of its unused concepts in a <i>Super Mario Odyssey </i>sequel.</p>
