      <p>North Carolina is having a serious come-up right now. With artists like <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/JCole/profile">J. Cole</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rapsody/profile">Rapsody</a>, and <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Da-Baby/profile/">DaBaby</a> reaching both critical and commercial acclaim across America and beyond, they've helped open the doors for other rappers from the city. Stunna 4 Vegas has been standing alongside DaBaby throughout the meteoric rise of the "Suge" rapper. Although he's yet to become a household name, the rapper is making the right strides to become one.</p>
      <p>Stunna 4 Vegas returned earlier today with a brand new collaboration alongside <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lilyachty/profile">Lil Yachty</a>. The two teamed up "Boat 4 Vegas," produced by "Act Up" hitmaker, EarlOnTheBeat. The rowdy banger has the two rappers going bar-for-bar over the bass-rattling production as they deliver braggadocious bars. The two also delivered a visual for the single which was directed by Reel Goats' who have handled many of DaBaby's videos.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>I'm rockin' Margiellas like Smooky<br/>No ratchet, I need a Karreuche<br/>Ass fat like Renni Rucci<br/>Make her eat dick, I ain't buyin' her Gucci</p>
