      <h1>More than 34 000 Gauteng pupils not placed in a school yet - Panyaza Lesufi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Canny Maphanga</a></address>
      <p>As of Monday, 12% of pupils had not yet been placed in a school in Gauteng, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has revealed.</p>
      <p>"As I am speaking to you now, there are only 34 553 [learners] who do not have spaces at all in Gauteng. Therefore, according to this, we have managed to place 85% of learners.</p>
      <p>"Roughly 13 000 are in Grade 1 and 21 000 are in Grade 8," Lesufi said during a briefing at the department’s headquarters in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>So far, the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) has managed to place 241 806 learners, which represents 85.5% of the 310 350 total applications.</p>
      <p>The placement period for the 2020 academic year has since been extended to November 30 to ensure that no learner is left without a school.</p>

          <b>Gauteng education department’s admission placement extended to November 30</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Of the 34 553 pupils who had not yet been placed, the GDE had released 6 000 placement offers for parents to accept.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, panic ensued after parents were sent a text message from the department that should not have been released, according to the MEC.</p>
      <p>"We want to assure parents that we have the matter completely under control, and our challenges will be responded to by extending our deadline to November 30," Lesufi added.</p>
      <p>Parents should note that they will be placed according to the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The applicant pupil's place of residence is closest to the school within the feeder zone;</li>
        <li>The applicant pupil has a sibling attending the school;</li>
        <li>The place of employment of at least one of the applicant pupil's parents is within the feeder zone of the school. The applicant pupil's place of residence is within a 30km radius of the school;</li>
        <li>The applicant pupil's place of residence is beyond a 30km radius of the school </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Should parents wish to decline a placement, they would be afforded the right to appeal.</p>
      <p>"Success rate of appeals are reasonable, 17% become successful," Lesufi said.</p>
      <p>"When your appeal is not successful, we give you an alternate. Every appeal has a happy ending." </p>
      <p>Lesufi further added that he understood parents wanting to ensure that their child was placed in what was deemed to be a "good public school".</p>
      <p>"We are not dealing with a system problem, we are dealing with preference. I would also prefer the best school for my child as well. I support those parents.</p>
      <p>"I am confident, that the department will and can deal with the backlog. Once more, we apologise for the inconvenience caused to parents," Lesufi said.</p>
