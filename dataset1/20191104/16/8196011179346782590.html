      <p>The Department of Education is considering its next steps in regards to a permanent building for Cork Educate Together Secondary School after the decision to refuse planning was upheld.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by the Irish Examiner, An Bord Pleanála (ABP) upheld a decision by Cork County Council to refuse planning on the proposed development in Douglas, mainly due to traffic concerns.</p>
      <p>The planning authority agreed that the submitted plans for the 600-student development on a greenfield site in Maryborough would “give rise to traffic hazard”, and could obstruct road users and endanger pedestrians.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Education and Skills confirmed the inspector’s report is currently being reviewed by the department after receiving it last week.</p>
      <p>“Following this review a decision on the next steps will be made,” he said.</p>
      <p>Educate Together has been working with the department to secure a permanent state-owned building for the school even before it opened in 2017, according to a spokesman for the patron body.</p>
      <p>“This school is a department project that is being provided to meet the increase in demand for school places,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Educate Together is disappointed that the planning process for such an important and urgently needed school has proven to be so difficult.</p>
      <blockquote>We are working with the Department and the Cork Educate Together Secondary School community on the issue and look forward to its speedy resolution.</blockquote>
      <p>Planning permission for the planned school build for the secondary school, which is currently based on Wellington Road, was initially lodged in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Further information was then requested by Cork County Council in May 2019, following which planning was refused.</p>
      <p>The Department of Education then appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanála in June 2019.</p>
      <p>The original application had sought to build a three-storey development to accommodate the non-denominational mixed secondary school at the site on the Carrigaline Road, Ardarrig in Douglas.</p>
      <p>The project was also set to include a PE hall, support teaching spaces as well as 150 cycle storage spaces, 67 parking spaces as well as four disabled car parking spaces, and ball courts.</p>
      <p>In its decision, ABP said it considered the proposed development’s proximity to the adjoining Carrigaline Road and the R855, as well as to a proposed draft Bus Connects corridor.</p>
      <p>It also expressed concerns about the road network in the area being unable to cater for the extra traffic likely to be generated.</p>
