【股票推介2020】20隻必買收息股、藍籌股、新股｜美團、眾安、華潤置地值得入手？
04 Nov 2019, 16:54 by 投資
現時距離2020年還有三個月時間，惟尋找明年投資機會卻永不嫌早。今次特別精選20隻必買股作為股票推介，好讓股民及早坐上這些有力穩步上揚的股票順風車。

友邦東南亞增長潛力大
除香港以外的業務，友邦保險（01299）在其他地區市場仍有極大競爭力。集團早前公布第三季業績，截至9月底， 按固定匯率計算，新業務價值上升1%，至9.8億美元。 撇除香港業務，新業務價值增長14%，可見香港業務拖低友邦整體新業務價值增長，但整體增長仍然相當不俗。 友邦業務大多集中於亞洲市場， 新業務保費中有過半來自內地和香港，本港反修例風波持續至今，對其業務有一定負面影響。
除香港業務，內地保險市場增長迅速，預期未來增長動力仍然強勁。 然而，其業務還有超過40%來自東南亞國家。東南亞擁有6億人口，發展潛力巨大，例如泰國、越南、菲律賓等發展中國家，提供了極大保險市場發展空間。因為當地經濟增長迅速，推動了保險需求。 在這個前提下，友邦前景的確值得看高一線。



煤氣獨市地位不變
燃氣屬於生活必需品，香港第一大市值的公用事業股香港中華煤氣（00003）更是自然壟斷者，業務發展成熟且穩定。 煤氣作爲公用事業，公司盈利一直有穩定增長。 雖然受近期社會事件影響，增長或會減慢，若社會逐漸回復穩定， 煤氣也會恢復穩步增長。 除了在香港市場外，公司將業務擴展至内地，業務重心由香港轉到全國。
截至7月底，煤氣在內地擁有260個項目，部分更是內地主要城市，如杭州。 根據中期業績報告，截至2019年6月底，公司在內地及香港的稅後營運利潤分別為21.2億港元（按年升2%）及16.7億港元（按年跌5%）。 可見，内地市場也為煤氣帶來更多發展商機及利潤。
恒隆内地增長加快
近年積極發展內地市場的恒隆地產（00101）未來數年將會有兩個新購物中心落成， 這成為未來盈利能力的重要支撐。 現時恒隆在内地擁有9個商場租賃物業，以及兩個位於武漢及杭州的在建項目。 今年下半年至明年，集團在內地有多座物業落成， 估計其在內地租金收入增長加快，而部分項目更會有住宅單位開售。
9月11日恒隆公佈中期業績，集團董事長陳啟宗表示，內地的租賃表現將保持上升趨勢。 由於內地租務市場告別熊市，零售業發展強勁，購物中心向高端市場發展，集團將與世界頂級時尚品牌簽署近60份租賃合同，其中約70%租約來自上海以外的購物中心簽署。 投資者可以預期未來有更多新商場開幕，支持恒隆內地業務收入增長加快。
美團有力挑戰騰訊
美團點評—W（03690）亦是2020年必買股。美團之所以長升長有，並非單純憧憬北水持續流，而是其有潛力成為下一隻騰訊控股（00700）。 騰訊持有美團重大股權；美團也借助微信小程序引入網上流量，故美團屬於騰訊陣營。不過，美團並非完全倚賴小程序。因為美團用戶傾向於使用應用程式取得服務。換言之，美團用戶的流量留在自己生態圈內，有條件進一步貨幣化。
何況，美團用戶黏性愈來愈高， 見諸於每位用戶平均每年交易宗數由2015年的10.4宗，升至2019年年中的25.5宗。近年美團開始減少補貼，惟每位用戶平均每年交易宗數仍錄得增長，可見其用戶早已經離不開美團。 美團亦有發展到店、酒店及旅遊的服務，可以供用戶預訂機票、酒店及預訂餐廳。截至6月底止的上半年，相關業務營業額已經升至97.4億元人民幣，同比上升43%，預計將會威脅網上旅遊平台携程（美股代號：CTRP）的領導地位。
瑞聲非聲學產品蓄勢待發
iPhone零件供應商瑞聲科技（02018）受惠新一代iPhone 11熱賣，蘋果公司（美股代號：AAPL）要求供應商增加生產800萬部。換言之，瑞聲將可獲蘋果公司增加光學零件訂單。 瑞聲不單止生產聲學零件，近年已經進軍不同零部件組合。例如光學零件已經出貨，今年次季月均出貨量達3,000萬套，按年上升100%。光學零件已經貢獻營業額（見圖一）。
集團預期今年年底月均出貨量將會倍升至6,000萬套。步進電機模組亦已經出貨予主流安卓手機客戶。 此外，瑞聲啟動攝像鏡頭模組項目及建設高端鏡頭模組工廠。 同時，集團加速晶圓級玻璃鏡片發展及量產， 亦發佈六種5G天線解決方案。換言之，瑞聲多項非光學產品線已經蓄勢待發，未來幾年具備多個增長點，可支持股價重拾高位。



ASM受惠半導體產業回春
近日半導體產業再度回春，全球最大的半導體代工生產商台積電（台股代號：2330）股價再創新高。ASM太平洋（02382）作為半導體封裝、測試設備生產商，其股價也隨之破頂。 本週集團公布第三季業績，收入為5.3億美元，按年減少19.5%。然而，純利按年減少63.1%，報2.2億港元。
不過，集團管理層表示注意到內地客戶似乎正再次帶動市場復甦，而不同業務有復甦傾向。例如引線架市場明顯復甦。 其實集團在先進封裝、影像感應器、第五代流動通通技術（5G）設備、物聯網、汽車、矽光子和小型及微型發光二極管顯示器等方面可以滿足客戶的需要。 此外　集團亦部署轉型，為客戶開發及試智能工廠解決方案，相信可以成為支持股價長線增長的動力之一。
招行回報率高值得股票推介
招商銀行（03968）為最出眾的內銀股，雖然業績增長並非最強勁，但股本回報率（ROE）卻偏高，反映出公司利用資產淨值產生純利的能力十分不錯。 股本回報率為純利和淨資產的比率，數值愈高代表該銀行愈有投資價值。 另一方面，招行在淨利息收益比很多同業高，單計上半年公司的淨利息收益率為2.7厘，較去年同期增加了0.16厘，而其他內銀股通常只有逾2厘左右。
原因是招行主力發展零售貸款， 甚至有半數的貸款餘額是用於此方面，在年化平均收益率達6.28厘，使淨利息收益表現不俗。 其次招行在非利息收入上表現強勁，上半年達509億元人民幣，其中銀行卡的手續費，以及結算及清算手續費，分別按年上升了18.8%和22.7%。 招行可在這個範疇上用最少成本獲得最多利潤。因為賺取非利息收入不耗用資本，又可快速帶動收入增長，故各大銀行都想增加非利息收入。市場相信未來電子支付使用量持續上升，利潤持續增加。
眾安受惠區塊鏈概念
區塊鏈概念股早前突然跑出， 源於國家主席習近平在區塊鏈技術發展現狀和趨勢第18次集體學習上提出，將加大投入力度推動區塊鏈技術及產業創新發展，導致區塊鏈上游、中游及下游的個股都有所追捧。 區塊鏈的上游是指一些為區塊鏈提供硬件支持的供應商，如礦場、礦機的生產商。
區塊鏈中游就是為區塊鏈提供底層架構、開發平台和生態的公司，如虛擬交易所、虛擬錢包等平台，最後區塊鏈下游就是會應用到區塊鏈的行業。目前內地發展最成熟的為下游，繼而是中遊，最後是上游。 下游焦點可放在眾安在綫（06060），源於集團為內地首間區塊鏈保險公司，所有業務已是線上處理。 眾安在綫還有一個區塊鏈和人工智能等技術的「安鏈雲」，而且聯合了沃樸物聯、e籤寶，及LOCKet等區塊鏈聯盟成員公司，陸續開發如電子簽約、防僞溯源等區塊鏈解決方案，未來有望可以覆蓋各行各業。 公司業務現時發展符合市場預期，包括下半年保費增長加速，以及預計明年轉盈，因此該股可多加留意。
平保客戶持續增長
中國平安（02318）早前公佈第三季業績，雖然基本面造好，淨盈利按年增長63.2%，核心壽險及健康險業務錄得30.5%的營運利潤增長，但是股價卻有顯著跌幅，曾挫逾3%。 而股價下跌最大的原因是新業務價值增長率只有4.5%，差於市場預期。 新業務價值為量度保險公司增長潛力指標。
雖然新業務價值增長不似預期，但是投資者不可忽略平保在首三季的個人客戶數量持續增加，較年初增加9.5%，互聯網用戶量更有10.4%的增幅。 當生態圈不斷擴張，再配合銀行業務及科技業務等交叉銷售，相信平保仍有穩健的增長潛力。 不少投資者都在關注環球利息向下，而影響公司經常性投資收益率，如平保中的壽險業務的負利差風險。 不過投資者可留意，環球宣布減息不是近期開始，相信負面消息已逐漸消化。
華潤置地變市區重建專家
除坐擁大量商業地產項目外， 華潤置地（01109）為市區重建專家，可以用相對便宜價格得取市區土地，從而獲得較高毛利率，並達致村民、政府及開發商的三贏局面。 深圳的萬象天地前身為大沖村， 經過收地及安置後，變身為商業地產連住宅的開發項目。 現時集團擁有18個市區重建項目，總建築面積接近2,400萬平方米，87%的土地儲備位於大灣區。
以全面建區重建項目計，有55%土地儲備位於深圳及廣州。 現時集團著手重建位於深圳羅湖區的湖貝村，其中一個焦點為興建樓高500米的湖貝塔，並興建住宅、商場及商廈；該項目還設有博物館、美術館、音樂廳、大劇院等文化設施。 雖然華潤置地是全國性發展商，惟集團在深圳至少擁有及營運三座大型商場，故集團亦具有大灣區概念。由於集團在大灣區的土地儲備比較集中在深圳，其大灣區概念亦比較實在。
龍光主攻深圳地鐵盤
龍光地產（03380）為另一家立足大灣區的內房股。其最大賣點是屢屢奪得鄰近深圳地鐵站土地。現時集團在深圳發展的地鐵物業項目數目達13個， 可受惠經濟增長及政策紅利。 其實，集團在深圳貨值達1,800億元人民幣。由於深圳樓價高企，當地人買房需求會外溢至惠州及東莞，集團在這兩個大灣區城市亦有土地儲備，現時貨值超過1,500億元人民幣。
早前龍光公布首三季合同銷售達716億元人民幣，同比上升30.7%， 已經相當於今年全年銷售目標的84%。上半年龍光合同銷售金額高達453.1億元，較去年同期按年上升27.7%（見圖二）。 集團在深圳、惠州及東莞的貨值高達3,300億元人民幣，減去所有的銀行負債及債券，資產淨值亦高達2,647億元人民幣。 市值相對資產淨值的幅度達78%。



碧桂園服務壟斷優勢無可取代
碧桂園服務（06098）為估值最高的內地物業管理股，市盈率高達60倍。碧桂園服務估值高昂有因，除物業管理業務具壟斷性外，碧桂園服務管理樓面高增長也是賣點所在。因為現時投資者心態是現時以高估值買入無問題，最重要是未來數年持續高增長，估值偏貴也會變得合理。
其實，碧桂園服務管理樓面增長來源之一，為碧桂園（02007）持嬻有新樓落成。碧桂園銷售按面動輒5,000萬平方米，如果全數交由碧桂園服務管理，將成為股價趨化劑。 雖然碧桂園服務為市值最大的內地物業管理股，惟其管理樓面僅5.8億平方米。根據恒大研究院院長任澤平發表《2019年住房存量報告》，去年全國全鎮住宅存量276億平方米而言，碧桂園服務市場佔有率僅2%。換言之，尚有大量增長空間。
海底撈火鍋熱歷久不衰
內地人熱愛打邊爐，火鍋舖開到成行成市。據中國飯店協會發布的《2019中國餐飲業年度報告》，2018年內地餐飲收入達42,700億元人民幣，按年增長9.5%，其中火鍋市場總收入約8,800億元人民幣。 富瑞的報告更形容，內地人對火鍋的需求永不滿足。預計其銷售增長優於零售銷售，不僅受惠國策及消費者喜好，海底撈（06862）的供應鏈及業務模式在整個連鎖餐飲業整合中亦最具優勢。
截至6月30日止中期業績，錄得純利9.1億元人民幣，按年大升40.9%；收入116.9億元人民幣，按年大增59.3%。增長主要源自餐廳經營業務，當中同店銷售較去年同期升4.7%至63.3億元人民幣；顧客人均消費微升至104.4元。 期內新開130間餐廳，全球餐廳數目增至593間；服務超過1.09億人次顧客；平均翻枱率每天4.8次。集團開舖態度進取，有助鞏固營業額高增長。 海底撈經營的火鍋業務涉及的技術含量較低，成本較傳統中式食肆為低，可以享有較高的邊際利潤，是其投資亮點之一。 集團持續開舖，支持高增長，其股價有力在今年稍後時間至明年再創高峰。
華潤啤酒攻高檔市場
內地啤酒龍頭華潤啤酒（00291）去年以23.2%市佔率稱霸國內市場（見圖三）。有見高檔啤酒市場在內地急速增長，故去年收購喜力中國。 潤啤今年首6個月業績亦顯示， 中高檔啤酒銷量按年增加7%；整體平均售價按年升4.5%，帶動營業額增加7.2%至188.3億元人民幣。
中期純利高達18.7億元人民幣，按年升24.1%。 華潤收購喜力交易發揮協同效應，管理層目標於未來五年將高檔市場的市佔率翻倍。由此路進，潤啤的毛利率進一步上升。 集團股價於8月再破紀錄達45.066元，其後回調並在40元水平上落，但在基本面理想兼利好因素帶動下，成為2020年必買股份之一。



中國食品靠可口可樂撐起
老牌紅籌中國食品（00506）獲可口可樂（美股代號：KO）授權經營在內地內陸地區的可口可樂的入瓶業務，與太古股份公司（00019及00087）共同瓜分內地市場。 2019上半年，中國食品收入有74%來自汽水類產品，進賬70.7億元人民幣，銷售按年增長9.5%。 與此同時，平均銷售價格同告上升，呈價量齊升之勢。 除了汽水業務，中國食品的果汁類和水品類等業務亦有不錯表現，集團又不斷推出更健康以及不同類型的新產品，回應消費升級下人們的新需求；並改良旗下產品組合，加快不同類型飲料佈局，如能量飲品、瓶裝水、即飲茶，料成未來業績增長動力。
領展民生商場抗逆
房地產信託基金（REIT）一向受追捧，原因是派息穩定，股息率平均有5厘。 不過近期受到環球經濟下滑及本地示威影響，不少核心區域出現吉舖，商舖租務市場非常淡靜導致房託表現失色。 在零售表現轉差下，連同本港市值最大的房託基金領展房產基金（00823）也曾見80.5元，創逾8個月低位。 不過領展的物業組合主要以民生所需為主，客戶群主打本地，因此相對較少受到外圍環境影響。
雖然領展股價下跌，但根據數據顯示，領展旗下商場店舖在7月至9月的營業額反而微升，反映出領展租戶的經營情況良好，單位價格具抗跌力。加上領展在市場轉差時仍沒有減租，相信對其租金收入沒有太大影響。 此外，雖然近年領展幾番轉售公屋商場，但是領展仍是擁有最多民生物業的企業，因此未來不會過於受市況轉差影響。 同時間，領展繼續不斷翻新旗下商場，以提升租金收入，而且翻新後可以為商場帶來更多人流，帶動消費增加。
粵投明年又屆加價年
粵海投資（00270）經營的業務十分廣泛，分別有水務供應、物業投資、酒店營運管理，能源項目投資，以及道路橋樑等等，集團最亮眼的業務為食水供應業務，佔整體收入62%。 粵海投資最成功的地方就是把水資源轉化成強勁的現金流，目前粵海投資持有東江水項目95%的權益，其中港府與廣東省政府更簽署了協議，每年為香港穩定供水，而東江水年年加價，在2018至2020年期間，每年平均加價0.3%，但供水量不變。明年合約到期，又屆加價年。
同時深圳和東莞地區的供水收入亦是不斷上升，單在去年就按年上升12.5%，因此可見集團獲利能力穩升，對派息十分有保證。 而且水資源業務不斷擴大，去年在江蘇、肇慶、汕頭、雲浮及梅州等地收購了7個水資源項目，相信將能更鞏固華東及廣東地區的業務，增加更多現金流。 另外，粵海在地產業務上表現同樣不俗，位於廣州的天河城的購物中心出租率幾乎100%，加上粵海在大灣區有不少物業，相信可受惠高速發展而持續增長。
越秀交通收購資產延續增長
中國政府公佈《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》，正式全面發展大灣區，當中以香港、深圳和廣州為大灣區重點發展城市。 未來當大灣區不斷發展成熟，各地往來將比以往頻繁，車輛流量亦會有所增加，當中越秀交通基建（01052）料會因而受惠。 集團在過去5年盈利不斷上升， 增長十分穩健，息率超過6厘。 集團主要經營一些經濟發展高增長省份的高速公路及橋樑，在收購湖北省三條高速公路前，共經營12條收費公路，大部分項目位於廣東省，如東莞虎門大橋。
當中除了廣州北環高速公路的經營期限餘5年外，其他幹線的經營期均超過10年。 同時集團持續擴展業務，早前向母公司越秀集團收購湖北省三條高速公路的經營權，分別是廣南高速、漢蔡高速，以及漢鄂高速。 以上公路均為當地城市主要使用及進出城市的要道，途經有多個經濟開發區，料交通流量及路費收入會持續上升。因此有理由相信越秀交通未來十年收入及純利可穩步增長。
中國鐵塔自由現金流強勁
內地工業及信息產業部副部長陳肇雄宣布週四（10月31日）正式開放5G作商用。 中國移動（00941）、中國聯通（00762）及中國電信（00728）分別推出5G月費計劃，收費介乎128元至869元人民幣不等。 中國鐵塔將會成為受惠者之一，今年8月管理層表示已經接到三大電訊營運商的建設基站需求，達65,000個，預期全年需求達10萬個。 截至6月底止，集團擁有的站址為195.4萬個，如果集團增加10個站址，就會突破200萬個。截至9月底止，塔類站址達197.39萬個，按年上升3%。 5G技術有別於4G技術，5G基站密度較高，所以對於興建電訊基站的需求增加，故中國鐵塔業務可穩步增長。 本週內地才剛剛開始投入商用， 相信電訊商繼續完善網絡，5G基站建設會持續一段時間。 其實，中國鐵塔興建基站後，供三大電訊營運商租用。
中國鐵塔收取租金收入，故截至6月底止的上半年，經營活動現金流達208億元人民幣，而從經營活動現金流減去資本開支的自由現金流為119億元人民幣（見圖四）。 倘下半年自由現金流相若，則全年自由現金流達238億元人民幣。 全年自由現金流回報率有㭃會接近8%，也是相當不俗的回報。 其實，集團在上市前尚未錄得自由現金流， 因為2015年、2016年及2017年期間，資本開支分別為2,291億、641億及438億元人民幣。 不過，集團上市後資本開支見頂，重現自由現金流。 集團既坐擁5G這個投資主題，又有可觀的自由現金流，成2020年必買股的重要原因。



中興通訊電訊設備市場要角
電訊電設股中興通訊（00763）也是5G受惠股之一。因為中興提供電訊基站設備，也是內地及全球推出5G商用中訊設備的重要供應商。除華為外，中興通訊也接獲大量5G訂單。 根據7月底資料，華為取得50份合約，而諾基亞則取得42份合約，中興則取得25份合約。再仔細看客戶各單，除內地三大電訊商外，還有Orange、Telefónica、Wind Tre等國際客戶。
其實，以全球的天線及交換機等電訊設備的銷售貨值計，中興佔全球市場佔有率達13%，位居全球第四位。 本週中興公布第三季業績虧轉盈，並公布今年全年業績的盈利預喜。 由此可見，集團已經成功過度早前因為美國制裁所帶來的負面影響，導致集團被中止從採購美國零件。不過，去年集團已經繳交罰款， 美國亦解除禁令。 所謂大難不死必有後福，中興在全球電訊設備市場仍保持優勢；隨全球5G加快出籠，可以推動業績增長，順利晉身2020年的必買股之列。

AIA's growth potential in Southeast Asia is large
In addition to business outside Hong Kong, AIA (01299) is still highly competitive in other regional markets. The group announced its third-quarter results earlier. As of the end of September, at a fixed exchange rate, the value of new business rose by 1% to US$980 million. Excluding the Hong Kong business, the value of new business increased by 14%. This shows that Hong Kong's business has dragged down the overall new business value growth of AIA, but the overall growth is still quite good. Most of the AIA business is concentrated in the Asian market. More than half of the new business premiums come from the Mainland and Hong Kong. The anti-reforms in Hong Kong continue to this day and have a certain negative impact on their business.
In addition to the Hong Kong business, the mainland insurance market is growing rapidly and it is expected that the future growth momentum will remain strong. However, more than 40% of its business comes from Southeast Asian countries. Southeast Asia has a population of 600 million and has great development potential. For example, developing countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines provide a great space for the development of the insurance market. Because the local economy is growing rapidly, it has boosted insurance demand. Under this premise, the AIA prospect is indeed worth seeing the high line.



Gas market status remains unchanged
Gas is a necessities of life. Hong Kong China Gas (00003), Hong Kong's largest market capitalization utility, is a natural monopoly. Its business is mature and stable. As a public utility, the company's profit has been growing steadily. Although the growth may slow down due to recent social events, if the society gradually returns to stability, the gas will resume steady growth. In addition to the Hong Kong market, the company has expanded its business to the Mainland and its business focus has shifted from Hong Kong to the whole country.
As of the end of July, the gas has 260 projects in the Mainland, and some of them are major cities in the Mainland, such as Hangzhou. According to the interim results report, as of the end of June 2019, the company's after-tax operating profit in the Mainland and Hong Kong was HK$2.12 billion (up 2% year-on-year) and HK$1.67 billion (down 5% year-on-year). It can be seen that the mainland market has also brought more development opportunities and profits to the gas.
Hang Lung's growth in the Mainland is accelerating
In recent years, Hang Lung Properties (00101), which is actively developing the mainland market, will have two new shopping centers completed in the next few years, which will become an important support for future profitability. At present, Hang Lung has 9 mall rental properties in the Mainland and two projects under construction in Wuhan and Hangzhou. From the second half of this year to next year, the Group has completed a number of properties in the Mainland. It is estimated that its rental income in the Mainland will increase, and some projects will have residential units for sale.
On September 11, Hang Lung announced its interim results. Chen Qizong, chairman of the group, said that the rental performance in the Mainland will continue to rise. As the mainland rental market bids farewell to the bear market, the retail industry develops strongly and the shopping malls develop into the high-end market. The group will sign nearly 60 lease contracts with the world's top fashion brands, of which about 70% are from malls outside Shanghai. Investors can expect more new stores to open in the future to support the growth of Hang Lung's mainland business revenue.
The US team has a strong challenge to Tencent
The US Mission Review - W (03690) is also a must-buy in 2020. The reason why the US group has grown up is not simply the continuous flow of water in the north, but its potential to become the next Tencent Holdings (00700). Tencent holds a major stake in the US Mission; the US Mission also uses the WeChat small program to introduce online traffic, so the US Mission belongs to the Tencent camp. However, the US Mission does not rely entirely on small programs. Because the US group users tend to use the application to get the service. In other words, the flow of Meituan users stays in their own ecosystem and is subject to further monetization.
What's more, the beauty of the US group users is getting higher and higher. The average number of transactions per user per year has risen from 10.4 in 2015 to 25.5 in mid-2019. In recent years, the US group began to reduce subsidies, but the average number of transactions per user per year still recorded an increase, showing that its users have long since been inseparable from the US group. The US group also has services to store, hotel and travel, which can be used for booking airline tickets, hotels and booking restaurants. In the first half of the year ended June, the turnover of related businesses has risen to 9.74 billion yuan, up 43% year-on-year, which is expected to threaten the leading position of Ctrip (US stock code: CTRP).
AAC's non-acoustic products are ready to go
iPhone component supplier AAC Technologies (02018) is benefiting from the next-generation iPhone 11 hot sale. Apple (US stock code: AAPL) requires suppliers to increase production by 8 million units. In other words, AAC will receive an order for Apple to add optical parts. AAC has not only produced acoustic parts, but has also entered different component combinations in recent years. For example, optical parts have been shipped, and the average monthly shipments in the second quarter of this year reached 30 million sets, up 100% year-on-year. Optical components have contributed to turnover (see Figure 1).
The Group expects monthly average shipments to double to 60 million units by the end of this year. Stepper motor modules have also been shipped to mainstream Android mobile phone customers. In addition, AAC started the camera lens module project and built a high-end lens module factory. At the same time, the Group accelerated the development and mass production of wafer-level glass lenses and also released six 5G antenna solutions. In other words, AAC's multiple non-optical product lines are poised for growth and will have multiple growth points in the next few years to support the stock price to regain its high position.



ASM benefits from semiconductor industry rejuvenation
Recently, the semiconductor industry has regained its resurgence. The share price of TSMC (Taiwan stock code: 2330), the world's largest semiconductor foundry manufacturer, has reached a new high. As a manufacturer of semiconductor packaging and test equipment, ASM Pacific (02382) has also broken its share price. This week, the group announced its third-quarter results, with revenue of $530 million, down 19.5% year-on-year. However, net profit decreased by 63.1% year-on-year to HK$220 million.
However, the management of the group has noted that mainland customers seem to be driving the market recovery again, and different businesses have a tendency to recover. For example, the lead frame market has clearly recovered. In fact, the Group can meet the needs of customers in advanced packaging, image sensors, fifth-generation mobile technology (5G) devices, Internet of Things, automotive, xenon photo and small and micro LED displays. In addition, the Group has also deployed a transformation to develop and test smart factory solutions for its customers. It is believed to be one of the driving forces behind the long-term growth of the stock price.
China Merchants Bank's high return rate is worthy of stock recommendation
China Merchants Bank (03968) is the most outstanding Chinese banking stock. Although its growth is not the strongest, the return on equity (ROE) is high, reflecting the company's ability to use net asset value to generate net profit. The return on equity is the ratio of net profit to net assets. The higher the value, the more investment the bank has. On the other hand, China Merchants Bank's net interest income is higher than many of its peers. In the first half of the year, the company's net interest margin was 2.7%, an increase of 0.16% compared with the same period last year, while other mainland banks usually only had more than 2%.
The reason is that China Merchants Bank mainly develops retail loans. Even half of the loan balance is used for this purpose. The average annual rate of return is 6.28%, which makes the net interest income perform well. Secondly, China Merchants Bank performed strongly on non-interest income. In the first half of the year, it reached 50.9 billion yuan, of which bank card handling fees and settlement and clearing fees increased by 18.8% and 22.7% respectively. China Merchants Bank can get the most profit in this category with the least cost. Because earning non-interest income does not consume capital and can quickly drive income growth, all major banks want to increase non-interest income. The market believes that the use of electronic payments will continue to rise in the future and profits will continue to increase.
Zhongan benefited blockchain concept
The blockchain concept stock suddenly ran out earlier. It was proposed by President Xi Jinping on the 18th collective learning of the status quo and trend of blockchain technology development. It will increase investment to promote blockchain technology and industrial innovation development. The stocks in the upstream, midstream and downstream of the blockchain are all sought after. The upstream of the blockchain refers to some suppliers that provide hardware support for the blockchain, such as mines and miners.
The middle of the blockchain is the company that provides the underlying architecture, development platform and ecology for the blockchain, such as virtual exchanges, virtual wallets and other platforms. Finally, the downstream of the blockchain is the industry that will be applied to the blockchain. At present, the most mature development in the Mainland is downstream, followed by the middle reaches, and finally the upstream. The downstream focus can be placed on Zhongan Online (06060), which originated from the Group's first blockchain insurance company in the Mainland, and all businesses are already processed online. Zhongan Online also has a ""chain cloud"" of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology, and combined with the members of the block chain alliance such as Wopu IOT, e-tag, and LOCKet, and successively developed such as electronic signing and anti-counterfeiting. Blockchain solutions such as traceability are expected to cover a wide range of industries in the future. The current development of the company's business is in line with market expectations, including accelerated premium growth in the second half of the year, and is expected to turn profit next year, so the stock can pay more attention.
Ping An customers continue to grow
Ping An (02318) announced its third-quarter results earlier. Although the fundamentals were good, net profit increased by 63.2% year-on-year. Core life insurance and health insurance business recorded a 30.5% increase in operating profit, but the stock price dropped significantly. Frustrated by more than 3%. The biggest reason for the stock price decline is that the growth rate of new business value is only 4.5%, which is worse than market expectations. The new business value is an indicator of the growth potential of insurance companies.
Although the growth of new business value is not as expected, investors can not ignore the number of individual customers in the first three quarters of Ping An, which increased by 9.5% compared with the beginning of the year, and the number of Internet users increased by 10.4%. As the ecosystem continues to expand and then cross-sells in banking and technology businesses, it is believed that Ping An still has solid growth potential. Many investors are concerned about the downward interest in global interest, which affects the company's recurring investment yield, such as the negative spread risk of life insurance business in Ping An. However, investors can note that the announcement of interest rate cuts by Global is not a recent start, and it is believed that negative news has gradually digested.
China Resources Land Conversion Urban Reconstruction Expert
In addition to a large number of commercial real estate projects, China Resources Land (01109) is an urban renewal expert who can obtain urban land at relatively low prices, thereby achieving higher gross profit margins and achieving a win-win situation for villagers, governments and developers. situation. Shenzhen's Vientiane World was formerly known as Dachong Village. After land resumption and resettlement, it became a commercial real estate and residential development project. At present, the Group has 18 urban renewal projects with a total gross floor area of nearly 24 million square meters and 87% of the land reserve is located in the Dawan District.
According to the comprehensive construction reconstruction project, 55% of the land reserve is located in Shenzhen and Guangzhou. At present, the Group has started to rebuild the Hubei Village in Luohu District, Shenzhen. One of the focuses is the construction of a lake tower with a height of 500 meters and the construction of houses, shopping malls and commercial buildings. The project also has museums, art galleries, concert halls, grand theatre and other cultures. facility. Although China Resources Land is a national developer, the Group owns and operates at least three large shopping malls in Shenzhen. Therefore, the Group also has the concept of Dawan District. As the Group's land bank in Dawan District is concentrated in Shenzhen, its concept of Dawan District is also quite realistic.
Longguang main attack Shenzhen subway disk
Longguang Real Estate (03380) is another mainland property stock based in Dawan District. Its biggest selling point is to repeatedly win the land adjacent to the Shenzhen subway station. At present, the number of MTR property projects developed by the Group in Shenzhen has reached 13 and can benefit from economic growth and policy dividends. In fact, the value of the group in Shenzhen reached RMB 180 billion. Due to the high property prices in Shenzhen, the demand for local buyers will overflow to Huizhou and Dongguan. The Group also has land reserves in these two large bay cities. The current value of the goods exceeds 150 billion yuan.
Longguang announced that contract sales in the first three quarters reached 71.6 billion yuan, up 30.7% year-on-year, which is equivalent to 84% of this year's sales target. In the first half of the year, Longguang contract sales amounted to 45.31 billion yuan, up 27.7% year-on-year (see Figure 2). The Group's value in Shenzhen, Huizhou and Dongguan amounted to RMB 330 billion, minus all bank liabilities and bonds, and its net asset value was as high as RMB 264.7 billion. The market value relative to the net asset value is 78%.



Country Garden service monopoly advantage is irreplaceable
Country Garden Service (06098) is the highest valuation of mainland property management stocks with a P/E ratio of 60 times. The valuation of Country Garden service is high. In addition to the monopoly of the property management business, the high growth of Country Garden service management floor is also the selling point. Since the current investor mentality is that there is no problem in buying at a high valuation, the most important thing is that the high growth in the next few years will make the valuation more expensive.
In fact, one of the sources of growth in Country Garden's service management floor was the completion of the new building for Country Garden (02007). Country Garden sales will be 50 million square meters in a face-to-face manner. If it is managed by Country Garden Service, it will become a stock price catalyst. Although Country Garden Services is the largest mainland property management stock with the largest market value, its management floor is only 580 million square meters. According to Ren Zeping, president of Evergrande Institute, published the ""2019 Housing Stock Report"". Last year, the country's residential stock of 27.6 billion square meters, Country Garden service market share is only 2%. In other words, there is still a lot of room for growth.
Haidilao hot pot heat lasts forever
Mainlanders love to beat the stove, and the hot pot spreads to the city. According to the ""2019 China Catering Industry Annual Report"" issued by the China Hotel Association, the catering revenue of the mainland in 2012 was 4.27 billion yuan, up 9.5% year-on-year, of which the total revenue of the hot pot market was about 880 billion yuan. Furui’s report further described that the demand for hot pot in the mainland is never satisfied. It is expected that its sales growth is better than retail sales. Not only is it benefiting from national policies and consumer preferences, Haidilao (06862)'s supply chain and business model are also the most advantageous in the integration of chain catering industry.
As of the end of June 30, the interim results recorded a net profit of 910 million yuan, up 40.9% year-on-year; revenue was 11.69 billion yuan, up 59.3% year-on-year. The increase was mainly due to the restaurant business. Among them, same-store sales rose by 4.7% to 6.33 billion yuan compared with the same period of last year; the per-capita consumption of customers rose slightly to 104.4 yuan. During the period, 130 new restaurants were opened, and the number of restaurants worldwide increased to 593; the service exceeded 109 million customers; the average turnover rate was 4.8 times per day. The Group's aggressive attitude is conducive to consolidating high growth in turnover. The hot pot business operated by Haidilao is low in technology and low in cost compared with traditional Chinese restaurants. It can enjoy high marginal profit and is one of its investment highlights. The Group continued to develop and support high growth, and its share price is strong enough to reach another peak later this year and next year.
China Resources Beer attack high-end market
Mainland beer leader China Resources Beer (00291) dominated the domestic market with a market share of 23.2% last year (see Figure 3). It is seen that the high-end beer market has grown rapidly in the Mainland, so it acquired Heineken China last year. Run Beer's performance for the first six months of this year also showed that the sales of medium and high-end beer increased by 7% year-on-year; the overall average selling price increased by 4.5% year-on-year, driving the turnover to increase by 7.2% to 18.83 billion yuan.
Interim net profit reached 1.87 billion yuan, up 24.1% year-on-year. China Resources acquired Heineken to play a synergistic effect, and management aims to double the market share of the high-end market in the next five years. As a result of this, the gross profit margin of Run Beer has further increased. The group's share price broke through a record of 45.066 yuan in August, and then it was adjusted back and down at the level of 40 yuan. However, it was one of the must-buy shares in 2020, driven by fundamental fundamentals and favorable factors.



Chinese food is propped up by Coca-Cola
The old red chip China Food (00506) was authorized by Coca-Cola (US stock code: KO) to operate the Coca-Cola bottle in the inland areas of the Mainland, and together with Taikoo Co., Ltd. (00019 and 00087) to divide the mainland market. In the first half of 2019, 74% of China's food revenue came from soda products, which accounted for 7.07 billion yuan, and sales increased by 9.5% year-on-year. At the same time, the average selling price has risen, and the price has risen. In addition to the soda business, China's food juices and water products also performed well. The Group continued to introduce newer and different types of new products, responding to new demands from consumers under the upgrade of consumption; and improving its product portfolio to accelerate different types. Beverage layouts, such as energy drinks, bottled water, and ready-to-drink tea, are expected to be the driving force for future growth.
Leading the exhibition of people's livelihood
Real estate trusts (REITs) have always been sought after because of the stable dividend payout and an average dividend yield of 5%. However, due to the recent global economic downturn and local demonstrations, many core areas have appeared in Jipu, and the retail rental market is very quiet, which has led to the loss of housing performance. Under the deterioration of retail performance, together with Hong Kong's largest value-added fund, the Real Estate Fund (00823) has also seen 80.5 yuan, a low of 8 months. However, the property portfolio of the Link is mainly based on the needs of the people's livelihood, and the customer base is mainly local, so it is relatively less affected by the external environment.
Although the share price of the exhibition was down, according to the data, the sales volume of the shopping malls of the exhibition was slightly increased from July to September, reflecting the good operating conditions of the tenants and the unit price with resilience. In addition, the consulate has not reduced rents when the market is in a bad position, and it is believed that it has little impact on its rental income. In addition, although the exhibition has been reselling several public housing malls in recent years, the exhibition is still the company with the most people's bio-industry, so the future will not be too affected by the deterioration of the market conditions. At the same time, the exhibition continued to refurbish its shopping malls to increase rental income, and after renovation, it could bring more people to the mall and drive consumption.
Guangdong Investment will increase the price of next year
Yuehai Investment (00270) operates a wide range of businesses, including water supply, property investment, hotel operation management, energy project investment, and road bridges. The Group's most eye-catching business is the water supply business, which accounts for 62% of the total revenue. %. The most successful place for Guangdong Investment is to convert water resources into strong cash flow. At present, Guangdong Investment holds 95% of the Dongjiang Water Project. The Hong Kong Government has signed an agreement with the Guangdong Provincial Government to provide stable water supply to Hong Kong every year. Dongjiang Water increases its annual price. During the period from 2018 to 2020, the average annual price increase is 0.3%, but the water supply is unchanged. The contract will expire next year and the price will increase again.
At the same time, the water supply revenue in Shenzhen and Dongguan is also rising. It has increased by 12.5% year-on-year in the previous year. This shows that the Group's profitability is rising steadily and the dividend payout is very guaranteed. Moreover, the water resources business has been expanding. Last year, seven water resources projects were acquired in Jiangsu, Zhaoqing, Shantou, Yunfu and Meizhou. It is believed that the business in East China and Guangdong will be further consolidated and more cash flow will be added. In addition, Guangdong has performed equally well in the real estate business. The occupancy rate of shopping malls in Tianhe City in Guangzhou is almost 100%. In addition, Guangdong has many properties in Dawan District, and it is believed that it can benefit from rapid development and continue to grow.
Yuexiu Transportation acquired assets to continue growth
The Chinese government announced the ""Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Dawan District Development Plan"", officially and comprehensively developed the Dawan District, with Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou as the key development cities in the Greater Bay Area. In the future, as the Dawan District continues to mature and mature, the traffic will be more frequent than before, and the traffic volume will increase. The Yuexiu Transportation Infrastructure (01052) is expected to benefit. The Group's earnings have been rising over the past five years, and its growth has been very stable with interest rates exceeding 6%. The Group mainly operates highways and bridges with high-growth provinces. It acquired 12 toll roads before the acquisition of the three expressways in Hubei Province. Most of the projects are located in Guangdong Province, such as Dongguan Humen Bridge.
Except for the remaining five years of the operation period of Guangzhou Beihuan Expressway, the operation period of other trunk lines has exceeded 10 years. At the same time, the Group continued to expand its business. It acquired the operating rights of the three expressways in Hubei Province to the parent company Yuexiu Group, namely Guangnan Expressway, Hancai Expressway and Han-Eu Expressway. The above roads are the main roads for the local cities to use and enter and exit the city. There are several economic development zones, and the traffic flow and toll revenue will continue to rise. Therefore, there is reason to believe that Yuexiu Transportation's revenue and net profit will grow steadily in the next decade.
China Tower's free cash flow is strong
Chen Xiongxiong, deputy director of the Ministry of Industry and Information Industry of the Mainland, announced that the 5G will be officially opened for commercial use on Thursday (October 31). China Mobile (00941), China Unicom (00762) and China Telecom (00728) respectively launched the 5G monthly fee plan, ranging from 128 yuan to 869 yuan. China Tower will become one of the beneficiaries. In August this year, the management indicated that it has received the construction base station demand of the three major telecommunications operators, reaching 65,000, and it is expected that the annual demand will reach 100,000. As of the end of June, the Group had a site of 1.954 million. If the group added 10 sites, it would exceed 2 million. As of the end of September, the number of tower sites reached 1,937,900, up 3% year-on-year. 5G technology is different from 4G technology, and the density of 5G base stations is high. Therefore, the demand for building telecommunications base stations is increasing, so the Chinese tower business can grow steadily. This week, the mainland has just started to put into commercial use. I believe that the telecommunications operators will continue to improve the network, and the construction of 5G base stations will continue for some time. In fact, after the construction of the base station by the China Tower, it was rented by the three major telecommunications operators.
China Tower received rental income, so in the first half of the year, the cash flow from operating activities reached 20.8 billion yuan, while the free cash flow from operating cash flow minus capital expenditure was 11.9 billion yuan (see Figure 4). If free cash flow is similar in the second half of the year, the free cash flow for the year will reach 23.8 billion yuan. The annual free cash flow rate of return will be close to 8%, which is also quite good returns. In fact, the group has not recorded free cash flow before listing, as the capital expenditures in 2015, 2016 and 2017 were 229.1 billion, 64.1 billion and 43.8 billion yuan respectively. However, after the listing of the group, capital expenditures peaked, regaining free cash flow. The group is not only interested in the investment theme of 5G, but also has considerable free cash flow, which is an important reason for buying shares in 2020.



ZTE's telecommunications equipment market
Telecommunications (ZTE) (00763) is also one of the 5G beneficiaries. Because ZTE provides telecommunications base station equipment, it is also an important supplier of 5G commercial intercom equipment in the Mainland and around the world. In addition to Huawei, ZTE has also received a large number of 5G orders. According to the information at the end of July, Huawei obtained 50 contracts, while Nokia obtained 42 contracts and ZTE obtained 25 contracts. Look carefully at the customer's orders, in addition to the mainland's three major telecommunications companies, as well as Orange, Telefónica, Wind Tre and other international customers.
In fact, ZTE accounts for 13% of the global market share of telecom equipment such as antennas and switches, ranking fourth in the world. This week, ZTE announced that its third-quarter results were turned into profit, and announced the profit forecast for this year's full-year results. It can be seen that the group has succeeded in over-severing the negative impact of the US sanctions, resulting in the group being suspended from purchasing US parts. However, the group has already paid a fine last year and the US has lifted the ban. The so-called big disaster will not be a blessing, ZTE still maintains an advantage in the global telecommunications equipment market; with the global 5G accelerated out, it can promote performance growth, and smoothly enter the 2020 must-buy.
