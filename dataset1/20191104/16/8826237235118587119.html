      <h1>A Barge Stuck Above Niagara Falls For Over a Century Broke Loose During a Storm</h1>

      <p>(NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario) â€” Parks officials are monitoring a century-old grounded barge that briefly broke loose during a storm last week in the river just above <a href="https://time.com/5084294/niagara-falls-frozen-2018/">Niagara Falls</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/local/severe-weather-causes-historic-iron-scow-towards-niagara-falls/71-b26403b6-5a68-440e-85b6-89ea12de5b9d">WGRZ</a> says the rusty iron scow had been stuck on rocks in the upper rapids above the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side since 1918. High winds and rain last Thursday dislodged it before it got stuck again. The Washington<i> Post</i> says it was originally about a third of a mile (0.5 km) from the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Then it moved about 164 feet (150 meters) downstream and became lodged again.</p>
      <p>A Niagara Parks official said it could be stuck in its new location for days or years.</p>
