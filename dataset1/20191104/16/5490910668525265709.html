      <p><b>MY OWN AVATAR:</b> Yoox hopes to take its <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/yoox-banks-on-ai-to-engage-customers-1202929078/">YooxMirror</a> AI-powered virtual styling functionality, the first in the sector, to the next level.</p>
      <p>Users of the Yoox App, which was introduced last year, were able to play with the e-tailer’s product offering by creating unique styles that were sported by an avatar called Daisy. But starting today they will be able to create their own digital avatar by taking a selfie or uploading an image.</p>
      <p>The functionality, called YooxMirror Reloaded, mixes AI and Augmented Reality technologies, and was developed in-house by the company’s research and development team.</p>

      <p>“Before Yoox, in 1999 you could only try on items in the changing room of a boutique, then with Yoox, your home became the new changing room. And now, with the YooxMirror, you can try on the clothes virtually,” said <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/federico-marchetti-honored-amfar-milan-1203248477/">Yoox Net-a-porter Group chairman Federico Marchetti</a>. “I’m proud of the pioneering innovations our talented R&amp;D team continues to make to give our customers a truly memorable and interactive experience.”</p>
      <p>Every week, YooxMirror Reloaded will give access to 250 products organized in nine fashion themes presented on the app with a “stories” format. The technology behind the app actually brings together merchandising insights with algorithms that can detect visual elements such as pattern or color on a product image and Deep Learning Networks, which can pick up product attributes and then select matching items.</p>
