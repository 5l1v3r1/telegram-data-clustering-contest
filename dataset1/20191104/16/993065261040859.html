      <p>Scientists have cracked the code of how a potent bacterial toxin kills MRSA, potentially paving the way towards new treatments for the superbug.</p>
      <p>New research sheds light on how the poison recognises MRSA cell walls and causes the pathogen to break down.</p>
      <p>Scientists from the University of Sheffield found lysostaphin is able to increase the number of its molecules bound to the surface of the MRSA cell.</p>
      <p>This allows the enzyme to make its way along the cell walls and cause rapid breakdown.</p>
      <blockquote>Hospital-acquired infections caused by bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics are on the rise, but our work could lead to the development of new treatments for these superbugs<cite>Dr Stephane Mesnage</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Although lysostaphin has been shown to eradicate Staphylococcal infections, such as MRSA, alone or in combination with antibiotics, not much has been known about how it kills the infections.</p>
      <p>Lead researcher, Dr Stephane Mesnage, senior lecturer in molecular biology and biotechnology, said: “Lysostaphin is arguably the most studied enzyme after lysozyme, so we are delighted that our research is able to explain the mechanism underpinning its potent antibacterial activity.</p>
      <p>“Our study explains how this enzyme is able to target and digest the MRSA bacteria and why it is so potent.</p>
      <p>“Hospital-acquired infections caused by bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotics are on the rise, but our work could lead to the development of new treatments for these superbugs that use the same targeting mechanism.”</p>
      <p>Researchers hope their findings will allow them to develop new treatments for MRSA and other antibiotic resistant superbugs which target the infection in a similar way.</p>
      <p>The study is published in the Nature Chemical Biology journal.</p>
