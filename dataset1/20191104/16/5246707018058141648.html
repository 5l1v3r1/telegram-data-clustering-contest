      <p>With the release of Nintendo's latest financial results, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> was confirmed not only to be <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/super_smash_bros_ultimate_becomes_the_best-selling_entry_in_the_series">the best-selling entry in the fighting series</a>, having sold 15.71 million units as of 30th September 2019, but it also climbed to number 2 on the Switch all-time best seller list, with only <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></b> keeping it <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/here_are_the_top_ten_best-selling_nintendo_switch_games_as_of_september_2019">from the top spot</a>.</p>
      <p>If that feat wasn't impressive enough, these sales numbers <i>also</i> take the game past a genre milestone; Smash Bros. Ultimate is now the best-selling fighting game ever, taking over both the seminal <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_turbo_hyper_fighting">Street Fighter II</a></b> (in all its myriad guises) and the combined total of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_smash_bros_for_wii_u">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_smash_bros_for_nintendo_3ds">3DS</a></b> which were standing in its way when it dethroned <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_smash_bros_brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></b> as the best-selling <i>individual</i> fighting game release <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/super-smash-bros-ultimate-is-now-the-best-selling-fighting-game-of-all-time/">back in April</a>.</p>
      <p>Totting up <a href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html">Street Fighter II figures</a> can cause headaches thanks to the huge number of versions that have appeared across arcade and home hardware since 1991. Indeed, <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Street_Fighter">if you counted</a> the copies on over 5 million Super NES / Famicom Classic Mini consoles around the world, Street Fighter II would still hold the crown with over 20 million unit sales. That would be weird, though.</p>

      <p>Smash Bros. Ultimate's performance is a remarkable feat. The game got off to a flying start and quickly became <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/uk_charts_super_smash_bros_ultimate_becomes_the_fastest-selling_smash_game_of_all_time">the fastest-selling entry in the series</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/super_smash_bros_ultimate_sets_peak_viewership_record_at_evo_2019">set peak viewership records at Evo 2019</a>, but to have become the best selling fighter <i>ever</i> after less than a year on sale is an accomplishment befitting the biggest video game crossover in history.</p>
      <p>And there's still more to come, with Terry Bogard waiting in the wings and Challenger #5 yet to be revealed, plus more DLC fighters to follow. Mr Sakurai, your team and every single Smash Brother and Sister, we salute you! <i>*<a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/random_this_smash_bros_fan_dressed_up_as_master_hand_and_crazy_hand_for_halloween">Master Hand and Crazy Hand</a> slow clap*</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Yeah, whatever - Smash isn't even a fighting game anyway." Ooo, who said that? Let us know your thoughts and if you think the copies of a game included on a Mini Console should count towards its overall unit sales below.</i>
