      <p>You may have already gotten in the holiday spirit, but are you looking for ways to make that spirit <i>bigger </i>and <i>boozier? </i>Lucky for you, big and boozy is just what Costco is all about. Which is why it maybe shouldn't come as a surprise to see that you can get a giant bottle of something called an <a href="https://www.bestproducts.com/lifestyle/a29657214/costco-kirkland-signature-egg-nog-wine-cocktail/">eggnog wine cocktail at Costco</a>, patron saint of all things mildly alarming that you obviously have to add to your cart.</p>
      <p>Spotted by Instagrammer @<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QiuLIB_zV/?utm_source=ig_embed">costcobuys</a> the Kirkland Egg Nog Wine Cocktails bottle looks like an instant holiday treat. Although I have to say, as much as I'm clearly on board with tipsy eggnog, I wouldn't have gone with <i>wine </i>as its natural bedfellow. Rum, surely — even some brandy if you're feeling all grandpa about it. But wine? I'm going to need some convincing, though some people seem to already be <i>very </i>much on board.</p>
      <p>"Game changer! My Costco just got these 1.5 liter Kirkland Egg Nog Wine Cocktails!" the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QiuLIB_zV/?utm_source=ig_embed">post</a> on @costcobuys reads. "This is made with real dairy cream, contains 13.9% Alc/Vol, and is best served over ice. I cannot WAIT to enjoy the holidays with this right by my side!"</p>
      <p>See — some people aren't deterred by the wine cocktail combo at all. This bottle of joy retails for $8.99, according to the post. We're talking well under 10 bucks for one and a half liters of holiday spirit.</p>

      <p>Eggnog isn't everyone's holiday go-to — I'm partial to peppermint and cinnamon buns, but we all need to find our own path. But if you <i>are </i>a fan of some ye olde eggnog, there is plenty to choose from this year. You can stick to classic eggnog, boozy eggnog, or you can reach for an <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/dunkins-2019-holiday-lineup-includes-a-toasted-gingerbread-latte-19288633">Eggnog Holiday Latte </a>from Dunkin' or the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/walmarts-holiday-treats-for-2019-have-hit-shelves-18801800">Great Value Eggnog Holiday Ice Cream </a>that Walmart has already been stocking for weeks. Or you can come up with your own concoction — a boozy egg nog milkshake does sound pretty delicious.</p>
      <p>But you may be asking a much more basic question — like what in the heck actually <i>is</i> eggnog? Well, fun fact: I didn't know either. But a little <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/this-eggnog-recipe-for-one-person-will-make-you-actually-like-the-controversial-holiday-drink-7598486">egg nog recipe for one</a> taught me that milk, spices, sugar, and, well, <i>egg </i>seem to be at the heart of this holiday classic. (And, of course, booze, if you're feeling it.)</p>
      <p>However you choose to mix your egg and your nog is your own decision, but I have to say that "eggnog wine cocktail" doesn't exactly roll off of the tongue for me. That being said, eggnog is such a traditional holiday tipple that maybe it's high time we mix it up a bit. So if you're curious, head on down to Costco and see if wine and eggnog go together like Santa and reindeer.</p>
