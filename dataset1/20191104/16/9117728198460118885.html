        <b>Frederic Vasseur has expressed his pleasure at retaining Antonio Giovinazzi for another season at Alfa Romeo, praising the Italian's work rate and approach to driving. Giovinazzi only has four points this season, but has improved in recent races, outperforming his far more experienced teammate Kimi Raikkonen on plenty of occasions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giovinazzi was always favourite for the seat, but with interest from Nico Hulkenberg, it wasn't as straightforward as it might have been. However, his efforts since the summer break, peaking with a ninth placed finish at his home race in Italy, convinced the team to keep him on.</p>

      <p>Vasseur adds that Giovinazzi brings much more to the team than just pace, saying: <i>“Antonio has done really well this year and I am extremely pleased to be able to confirm he will stay with Alfa Romeo Racing for 2020.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"The way he has integrated into the team and has consistently improved throughout his first full season in the sport are very promising and we cannot wait to unlock his full potential as we continue to work together.</i>

        <i>"Antonio has emerged as a very quick driver, even alongside as tough a benchmark as Kimi, and we expect him to develop even further as his experience grows. His technical feedback, work ethics and positive approach will help us continue to push our team forward, and so will the consistency of an unchanged line-up for next season.”</i>
