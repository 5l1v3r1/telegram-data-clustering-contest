Waziri Mkuu wa Sudan Abdallah Hamdok amewahakikishia Jumatatu wiki hii waathiriwa wa mgogoro wa Darfur kuwa serikali yake imeundwa kwa minajili ya kurejesha usalama na amani katika jimbo hilo.

Karibu watu 300,000 waliuawa na milioni 2.5 walilazimika kutoroka makaazi yao wakati wa mgogoro huo, kwa mujibu wa Umoja wa Mataifa.
Waziri Mkuu amekutana na waathiriwa katika mji wa El-Facher, mji mkuu wa Darfur Kaskazini, ambapo kunapatikana kambi nyingi za mamia ya maelfu ya wakimbizi wa ndani wa Sudani kwa miaka kadhaa.
""Tunataka tutendewe haki! Watumeni wahalifu wote wa Darfur katika Mahakama ya Kimataifa ya Makosa ya Jinai (ICC),"" wakimbizi wamekuwa wakiimba wakati wa zaiara ya Bw Hamdok katika kambi mbili za wakimbizi hao, mwandishi wa shirika la Habari la AFP amesema .
""Ninajua madai yenu,"" amesema Hamdok. ""Sote tutashirikiana kutimiza maombi yenu na kuhakikisha maisha ya kawaida yanarudi,"" ameongeza, mbele ya umati wa watu waliokuwa wakiimba ""hakuna haki, hakuna amani Darfur"".

Hamdok: I want to restore peace in Darfur
04 Nov 2019, 16:39 by RFI

Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok confirmed on Monday to victims of the Darfur crisis that his government was designed to restore security and peace in the province.

Mr Hamdok made that statement during his first visit to the State of Darfur, West Sudan.
Abdallah Hamdok visits Darfur on a one-day visit. Darfur experienced a crisis in 2003 involving a rebel group claiming the ouster of the ousted President Omar al-Bashir.
Nearly 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million were forced to flee their homes during the crisis, according to the United Nations.
The prime minister has met with victims in the city of El-Facher, the capital of North Darfur, where many hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugee camps are located.
""We want justice for us! Send all Darfur criminals to the International Criminal Court (ICC),"" refugees have been singing during Mr Hamdok's visit to two of the refugee camps, an AFP correspondent said.
""I know your claim,"" said Hamdok. ""We will all work together to fulfill your prayers and ensure that normal life returns,"" he added, in front of a crowd chanting ""no justice, no peace in Darfur"".
