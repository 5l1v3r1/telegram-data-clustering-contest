（中央社記者顧荃台北4日電）中國國台辦今天公布提供台灣民眾同等待遇措施，簡稱「26條措施」，外交部長吳釗燮在推特用簡體字發文回嗆，看起來好多條，但台灣用不到一國兩制，「給你們人民多點自由也不錯喔」。
吳釗燮下午在外交部推特發文說，中國國台辦推出對台26條，去年也有31條，看起來好多條，「但我們台灣用不到一國兩制，真的不用客氣，給你們人民多點自由也不錯喔」。



中國國台辦與國家發改委今天聯名推出「關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施」，內含26條，其中針對台灣企業、台灣民眾各13條，標榜「提供與中國民眾同等待遇」。
針對對台26條措施，外交部發言人歐江安表示，其中第14條明載「台灣同胞可在中華人民共和國駐外使領館尋求領事保護與協助，申請旅行證件」，對此外交部嚴正聲明，中華民國台灣是主權國家，政府對國民行使領事權與中國無涉，不需要也不會委託中國政府代為行使。
歐江安說，中國政府所提措施，只不過是在推銷「一國兩制台灣方案」，意在最終併吞台灣，政府已經多次清楚說明，拒絕一國兩制就是台灣共識，中國政府假意惠台，不會得逞。（編輯：紀淑芳）1081104

Wu Hao's simplified Chinese character returns to Taiwan 26: giving the Chinese people more freedom
04 Nov 2019, 16:39 by https://www.facebook.com/cnanewstaiwan, Central News Agency
(Central News Agency reporter Gu Yu Taipei on the 4th) China’s Taiwan Affairs Office announced today that it would provide Taiwan’s equal treatment measures, referred to as “26 measures”. Foreign Minister Wu Hao’s post in Simplified Chinese is very good, but Taiwan does not use it. To one country, two systems, ""It is not bad to give your people more freedom.""
In the afternoon, Wu Hao issued a message in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council launched 26 articles against Taiwan. There were also 31 articles last year. It seems that there are many articles. ""But we do not have one country, two systems in Taiwan. It is really polite to give your people more freedom. It’s not bad.”



The China Taiwan Affairs Office and the National Development and Reform Commission jointly launched the ""Several Measures to Further Promote Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"", which contains 26 articles, of which 13 are for Taiwanese companies and Taiwanese people, and they are advertised as ""providing the same treatment as the Chinese people.""
In response to the 26 measures against Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ou Jiangan said that Article 14 clearly states that ""Taiwan compatriots can seek consular protection and assistance at the embassies and consulates of the People's Republic of China to apply for travel documents,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly declares The Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign state. The government has no right to exercise consular power over the country and does not need or entrust the Chinese government to act on its behalf.
Ou Jiangan said that the measures proposed by the Chinese government are only selling the ""one country, two systems Taiwan plan"", which is intended to eventually swallow Taiwan. The government has clearly stated that the rejection of one country, two systems is the Taiwan consensus, and the Chinese government will not succeed in deliberately benefiting Taiwan.
