        <i>Lewis Hamilton wrote his name into the pantheon of Britain's all-time sporting greats by winning his sixth Formula One world championship in Austin, Texas.<br/>The 34-year-old moved ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio and within striking range of Michael Schumacher's record collection of seven after he finished second in the United States Grand Prix. "I really like number six, it sounds good. But it hasn't sunk in just yet. I feel fresh. I feel like I'm ready for another race."</i>
