Blizzard Has ""No Idea"" When Overwatch 2 Will Be Released, Just Wants To ""Make It Great""
Expect to hear more at next year's BlizzCon

As exciting as the Overwatch 2 announcement was at BlizzCon this year, it's probably the last thing you wanted to hear if you recently picked up a copy of Overwatch: Legendary Edition on the Switch less than a month ago.
Thankfully, the original game will remain relevant – with Blizzard confirming it will be part of a shared multiplayer update, featuring the same heroes, maps and modes in PvP. Overwatch Director and Blizzard Vice President Jeff Kaplan has also mentioned how the first game is likely to stay in the spotlight for at least another year from now.
This was what he said during an interview with VG247:
I don’t have a date, It’s not this year, that’s a pretty safe answer...I have a feeling we’ll be talking about Overwatch 2 again next year at BlizzCon. If that helps.
During a BlizzCon panel, Kaplan explained how the team didn't really know when the sequel would be released:
I have no idea. Like, just let us make it great… We don’t have a date in mind.
Like I mentioned, Overwatch 2 is still in development, and we have a long ways to go before this game is fully ready.

Did you pick up Overwatch on the Switch last month? What are your thoughts about a sequel? Comment below.
