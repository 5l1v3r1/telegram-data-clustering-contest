      <p>An Italian offshore supply vessel has brought 151 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/migrants.html">migrants</a> to Sicily after rescuing them in waters off <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/libya.html">Libya</a> a day earlier.</p>
      <p>The Asso Trenta docked on Sunday at Pozzallo with the migrants. It was not immediately known if they would stay in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/italy.html">Italy</a>,Â or be distributed among other European Union countries.</p>
      <p>Hours earlier, a German charity's rescue boat, Alan Kurdi, had dropped 88 migrants off at Taranto on the Italian mainland. Under an EU-brokered deal, 67 of them will go to four other countries, while the others will stay in Italy.</p>
      <p>A Taranto official, Gabriella Ficocelli, told the Italian news agency ANSA the migrants included five unaccompanied minors who were "tired and tried by the voyage."</p>
      <p>They disembarked eight days after being rescued in the Mediterranean Sea from Libyan-based traffickers' rickety vessels.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Greek government's decision to transfer migrants from the overcrowded eastern Aegean islands to the mainland was met with some resistance.</p>
      <p>Residents, in two instances, tried unsuccessfully to prevent migrants from being housed in hotels in northern Greece.</p>
      <p>An anti-migrant march in the northern city of Thessaloniki on Sunday was attended by around 100 people, while a counter-demonstration of anarchists drew a slightly larger crowd.</p>
      <p>Migrants who had arrived by military transport from the island of Lesbos to a port near Athens on Saturday had to wait hours in buses in order to be able to finally sleep at designated hotels whose owners agreed to lodge the migrants.</p>
      <p>The migrants were driven in buses for more than 500km (310 miles) to reach their destinations in northern Greece.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a van carrying an estimated 15 Pakistani migrants turned over on a main highway east of Thessaloniki on Sunday, killing one and slightly injuring five.</p>
      <p>The police were not certain about the exact number of migrants because the others, including the driver, fled the scene before police arrived.</p>
      <p>In North Macedonia, a court ordered a 30-day pre-trial custody for three Pakistani nationals, suspected of human trafficking and cruelty to migrants.</p>
      <p>The Skopje's prosecutor office announced on Sunday that they had opened a probe against three Pakistanis and one Macedonian national for organising the illegal transfer of migrants and abusing them. The Macedonian national, owner of the house, was placed under house arrest.</p>
      <p>Police raided a house in the village of Vaksince, near the northern border with Serbia, on Friday and found 12 migrants from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, including two minors.</p>
      <p>They acted on a tip from Serbian police who had been alerted by a friend of the migrants that they were being beaten and asked to pay 1,300 euros ($1,450) each to the smugglers for transfer across the border.</p>
