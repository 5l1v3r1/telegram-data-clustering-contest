      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T01:11:47+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 01:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sofia Petkar</a></address>
      <p>Demi Lovato has opened up about her mental health struggles, a year after taking an overdose at her Los Angeles home.</p>
      <p>In her first major interview in over a year, the 27-year-old star described herself as a “fighter” as she focused on her personal battle of the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Demi was rushed to hospital in July 2018 after being found unconscious at her Hollywood Hills home following a suspected opioid overdose.</p>
      <p>She was hospitalised for 12 days and later checked herself into a rehab for a three-month stint.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Teen Vogue editor in chief Lindsay Peoples Wagner at the Teen Vogue Summit in LA this weekend, Demi said: “What I see in the mirror [is] someone that's overcome a lot.</p>
      <p>"I've been through a lot and I genuinely see a fighter.</p>
      <p>“I don't see a championship winner, but I see a fighter and someone who is going to continue to fight no matter what is thrown in their way.”</p>

      <p>The Sorry Not Sorry singer went on: “I think it's been a very introspective year for me. I've learned a lot, been through a lot.”</p>
      <p>Demi also revealed that she is no longer putting stress on her body, choosing instead to spend most of October in the gym.</p>
      <p>She said: “For so many years I dealt with an eating disorder. What I wasn't ever open with myself about was, whenever I was in the gym I was doing it to an unhealthy extreme.</p>
      <p>“I think that's what led me down a darker path - I was still engaging in these behaviours. Embracing my body as it is naturally is why I took the month of October off the gym.”</p>

      <p>Demi has struggled with bulimia for years, fighting the eating disorder in the public eye for most of her life.</p>
      <p>The star’s struggles began aged just nine, when she started binge-eating and purging after being heavily bullied at school.</p>
      <p>Her teens saw Demi self harming and self medicating with alcohol, cocaine and painkillers.</p>
      <p>The star’s struggles and appearance have also often been the subject of cruel comments and trolling online.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the effects of social media on her emotions, Demi said: “What people don't realise is I'm an extremely sensitive person.</p>
      <p>“When someone says something mean about me or makes a meme making fun of me, I have a good sense of humour. But when it's a very serious subject it can be hurtful.</p>
      <p>“I'm so tired of pretending I'm not human. When you say stuff, it affects me. I try not to look, but I see it.”</p>
