      <p>Two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">murder suspects,</a> considered dangerous, escaped Sunday from a central <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> jail sparking a frantic manhunt, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Santos Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, escaped from the Adult Detention Facility in the early morning, the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office announced.</p>
      <p>Both men are five-feet-seven-inches tall, and they each have black hair and brown eyes, The Associated Press reported; Fonseca weighs 150 pounds and Salazar weighs 170 pounds.</p>
