Adobe Photoshop Finally Arrives on the iPad
04 Nov 2019, 01:05 by msmash
Adobe Photoshop is now available for iPads. From a report: The release follows an official announcement at Adobe's MAX event last year. The app is free to download and use for 30 days, but you'll need a Creative Cloud subscription to continue using it after that. If you already have a subscription for Adobe's desktop apps that covers Photoshop, you should be good to go -- you just need to log in with your paid account credentials. The app has full support for Apple Pencil, and lets you work on full PSD files -- layers and all. The company has also modified oft-used Photoshop functions for touchscreen interfaces, such as quick selection and paintbrush.
