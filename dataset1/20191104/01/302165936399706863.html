      <p>AUSTIN, Nov 4 — Lewis Hamilton cemented his position as one of Formula One’s true greats when he captured his sixth world title, a staggering achievement described as “not bad for a boy from a council house.”</p>
      <p>His second-place finish at the United States Grand Prix yesterday took him past the five titles of Juan-Manuel Fangio — who he describes as “The Godfather” — and to within one of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher.</p>
      <p>He had already won more than men like Australia’s Jack Brabham, fellow-Briton Jackie Stewart, Austrian Niki Lauda and Brazilians Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna in a spectacular statement of achievement.</p>
      <p>The son of a black father and a white mother, who survived a broken home in his youth, Hamilton, 34, grew up on a municipal housing estate where his father Anthony at one time held down three jobs to fund his son’s embryonic racing career in karts.</p>
      <p>His journey was unprivileged and without luxury, but it was clear from an early age that he had an outstanding gift for speed and all the gutsy natural instincts of a born racer.</p>
      <p>In 1995, aged 10, and wearing a jacket and shoes borrowed from his predecessor as British Formula Cadet karting champion, he went to a glittering awards ceremony in London where he met McLaren’s then-boss Ron Dennis.</p>
      <p>He asked for an autograph and told him “one day I want to race for you”. Dennis replied: “Phone me in nine years and I’ll sort you a deal.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Mercurial, tempestuous’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bold, determined and individual, he almost won the title in his first record-breaking season as he reeled off nine successive podiums from his debut in Melbourne, rocking the establishment along the way with his speed and his style.</p>
      <p>On and off the track, he was fast, somewhat mercurial and occasionally tempestuous and this combination led to a fierce rivalry with team-mate and two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who left McLaren at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>That was a signal of how tough it was to be for all his future team-mates as Hamilton, who narrowly missed out on the 2007 title, returned to triumph in 2008 with a dramatic last-gasp fifth-place finish in Brazil.</p>
      <p>He also showed frustration as McLaren failed to deliver the speed to beat current rival and four-time champion Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull, who reeled off four straight title triumphs from 2010 to 2013, by when Hamilton had departed for Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Escaping the management regime of Dennis and his father, Hamilton found freedom at Mercedes alongside team-mate German Nico Rosberg, his teenage karting friend and rival.</p>
      <p>This enabled Hamilton to express himself with a headline-grabbing trans-Atlantic lifestyle, mixing with musicians and ‘fashionistas’.</p>
      <p>He showed little love for any duty to obey conventions and, for many observers, gave his sport a welcome injection of freshness and diversity as champion again in 2014 and 2015.</p>
      <p>Rosberg broke Hamilton’s sequence of supremacy in 2016 and then retired, leaving the Englishman to dominate.</p>
      <p>His former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button summed up Hamilton’s pure speed when he said: “For me, over one lap, I don’t think there is anyone as quick as Lewis and I don’t think there ever has been.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Never satisfied’</b>
      </p>
      <p>That speed, which has always been a natural talent, has in recent seasons been allied to a more mature attitude to his job as team leader.</p>
      <p>Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff summed up: “He is never satisfied. He never settles. He is never happy with where he is as a racing driver and a human being. He wants to optimise, to develop and he is very much part of the leadership of the team.”</p>
      <p>Having achieved so much as his sport’s best-known ambassador, Hamilton’s interest in social issues has emerged more frequently.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, he posted his concerns for the environment and revealed a fleeting despair at the state of the world when he used Instagram to declare that the planet was “a messed-up place” and he felt he wanted “to give up”. </p>
      <p>That commentary, including revelations about his vegan lifestyle, led to him being accused of hypocrisy.</p>
      <p>“I’m only human,” he said. “Like everyone, we have up and down days. That’s what I’ve been really trying to convey.”</p>
      <p>His own career and his quest for self-expression and freedom has shaped his advice for young drivers.</p>
      <p>“What I can definitely advise any kid that’s out there trying to race is don’t listen to people who tell you that you need a mental coach or you need someone to help control your mind,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You need to let it run wild and free and discover yourself. It is all about discovery. And only you can do it.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, father Anthony summed up his son’s achievement: “It’s absolutely amazing and not bad for a boy from a Stevenage council house.” — AFP</p>
