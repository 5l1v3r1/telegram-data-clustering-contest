      <p>(CNN) - Two suspects escaped from a Northern California jail early Sunday, the Monterey County Sheriff's Office said.</p>
      <p>Santos Samuel Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, were being held in the Monterey County Adult Detention Facility awaiting trial on unrelated murder charges, the sheriff's office in a message on Facebook. The two face other felonies, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office didn't say how the men escaped, but they said the means of escape is under investigation.</p>
      <p>The pair had been in custody since 2018. Deputies say they should be considered dangerous.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office is asking the public to contact them at (831) 755-3722, 24 hours a day with any information on the two suspects. Tips may be submitted to department's confidential tip line by calling (888) 833-4847. Callers can remain anonymous.</p>
      <p>Monterey County is south of San Jose, on the Pacific coast.</p>
