      <p>THE former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, has urged the Catholic Church to allow women to become deacons.</p>
      <p>Ms McAleese, who is the incoming chancellor of Trinity College Dublin, was speaking at an event at the university on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Following a recent synod in Rome, bishops are to consult with a papal commission on the potential ordination of women as deacons.</p>
      <p>Deacons cannot celebrate Mass but can assist a priest in a number of duties including performing baptisms, witnessing marriages, and leading funeral and burial services outside of Mass.</p>
      <p>The role of permanent deacon is currently reserved exclusively for men who have no intention of becoming priests.</p>
      <p>Ms McAleese said: "It won't solve the problems in the church but it would be a breakthrough. It would be a breach of the bunker in some ways, because the bunker ultimately is the bunker of really embedded misogyny.</p>
      <p>"It goes very, very deep. It goes so deep that good men don't even see it themselves," she said.</p>
      <p>Joining the former president at the conference was US theologian and Benedictine nun Sr Joan Chittister. The pair were billed as "the women the Vatican couldn't silence".</p>
      <p>Sr Chittister said women "make very good window dressing" in the Catholic Church, but added "in terms of being able to contribute as a baptised person to the development of the church, we are not there".</p>
      <p>"Some day you have to wake up and say what you see, and what I see is that the Catholic Church, for women, is a totally owned subsidiary of pious males. We really are not full members of the church. We are the outside edge."</p>
      <p>On the subject of asylum seekers, Ms McAleese, who was president for 14 years from 1997, said the fact migrants were "not experiencing the kindness that I know is the ethic of our country and our people" was something which "bothers me greatly".</p>
      <p>In recent weeks there have been protests against the accommodation of asylum seekers across several counties in Connacht.</p>
      <p>Ms McAleese did not refer to those specific cases but said: "My God tells me I have to be the stranger who is kind. That simple . . . it bothers me greatly finding that (in) a country that I'm so proud of, that sometimes people are not experiencing the kindness that I know is the ethic of our country and our people.</p>
      <p>"We relied on it (kindness) ourselves so often when we went as emigrants to other countries, poor, our two hands the one length, looking for opportunity."</p>
