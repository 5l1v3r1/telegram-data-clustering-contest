      <p>To some he is a true comedy legend. To others, he's the man with the best brows in the business.</p>
      <p>However you see him, there is no denying that Jimeoin is downright hilarious.</p>
      <p>The Irish stand-up comic is now touring his latest show, Result, around the Hunter and Central Coast in November and December with stops scheduled for Belmont, Hexham, Cessnock, Doyalson and New Lambton.</p>
      <p>"It's just really a lot of nonsense and you're none the wiser at the end of it all," Jimeoin said of Result.</p>
      <p>"It's just a daft show, that's the idea of it, and it's a fun show. It's not political and it never really has been political.</p>
      <p>"It's an hour show that I hope people will come by and have a good laugh at. I haven't had a go at anybody other than myself."</p>

      <p>A prolific writer with an exceptional audience rapport, Jimeoin is known and loved for his brilliantly funny wit and charming observations on the absurdities of every-day life. He has been making international and Australian audiences laugh at his observations since the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Jimeoin said he was still happy doing comedy after so many years.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy with the longevity; that I could make a career out of comedy," he said.</p>
      <p>An internationally-acclaimed performer, Jimeoin's regular appearances at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and his widely successful Australian tours often sell-out in advance.</p>
      <p>Internationally, he has toured to great acclaim from New York to New Zealand, Aspen to Amsterdam, the Middle East to the Far East.</p>
      <p>He has also performed around Europe and the UK and is a regular invitee to the Mecca of comedy, Montreal's Just For Laughs Festival.</p>
      <p>He has also appeared regularly at the Adelaide and Melbourne Comedy Festivals, the Auckland Comedy Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival among others.</p>

      <p>Between 2005 and 2008, he was touring throughout the vast outback regions of Australia as well as playing the major cities and festivals across the land.</p>
      <p>He was so well-received he became the first comedian to go and tour totally "over the top", playing a mix of hotels, theatres, swimming pools, cattle ranches and anywhere that looked a bit interesting.</p>
      <p>This was filmed for a TV series on BBC Northern Ireland called <i>Jimeoin Down Under</i>.</p>
