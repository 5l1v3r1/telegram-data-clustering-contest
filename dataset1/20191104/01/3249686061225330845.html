      <p>'<b>Icepray</b>' is doing marketing right.</p>
      <p><b>VICTON</b>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/byungchan"><b>Byungchan</b></a> is the endorsement model for 'Icepray', a facial spray that is soothing and cooling. One of their taglines is 'Icepray for...', where both Byungchan, the brand, and consuming fans write whatever they're 'praying' for.</p>
      <p>As VICTON's comeback is just a few hours away, 'Icepray' took to their Twitter to post 7 different 'Icepray for..' tags: one fore each member, including <b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/han-seung-woo">Seungwoo</a></b>. Seungwoo is currently serving as the leader of <b>X1</b> as one of the finalists of '<b>Produce X 101</b>', but VICTON and their fans have been missing their leader a lot. The mention by 'Icepray' has touched many fans' hearts, who are thanking 'Icepray' for including him.</p>
      <p>VICTON will be back later tonight at 6PM KST with '<b>Nostagia</b>'.</p>
