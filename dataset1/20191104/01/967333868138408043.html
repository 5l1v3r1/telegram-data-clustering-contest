        <b>Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has been fighting off accusations by former first lady and 2016 Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton that she is a planning to run as a third party and that she is a "Russian asset".</b>
      </p>
      <p>2020 Democratic presidential hopeful and Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard rejected claims from former White House adviser Steve Bannon that she was once considered for a position within the Trump administration in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_7hN_1fKM">interview with Fox News</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“First of all, I was not there to interview for a job; I was there to discuss my foreign policy views”, Gabbard said.</p>
      <p>Gabbard pledged to change the nature of the Democratic Party and completely transform how the party operates if she were to be elected president.</p>
      <p>“What I plan to do as the Democratic nominee and as president is to rebuild a new Democratic Party”, she said.</p>
      <p>“One that truly represents the interest of the people of this country that is fighting for them, fighting for their well-being, fighting for the well-being of our country and protecting our national resources on this planet.”</p>
      <blockquote>Gabbard hit out against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for “implementing their own pre-primary election before voters get a chance to vote" at the expense of the electorate.</blockquote>
      <p>Despite challenging the Democratic hierarchy, Gabbard refuted suggestions by failed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in October that she was considering running on a third-party party ticket if her race for the Democratic nomination fails.</p>
      <p>“I will not run as a third-party candidate”, Gabbard said.</p>
      <p>She hit back against Clinton, saying that Clinton's "proxies and minions have been trying to smear my character, reputation and undermine my campaign".</p>
      <p>Gabbard, who served in the US Army and Iraq following the 9/11 attacks, called the accusations “completely baseless” and “offensive” given her military service.</p>
      <p>“I will never be able to undo what they have done in trying to cast suspicion amongst the American people about where my loyalties actually lie”, she said.</p>
      <p>When asked if she knows <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910191077089279-queen-of-warmongers-tulsi-gabbard-slams-hillary-clinton-over-russian-grooming-claims/">why the smear campaign</a> was launched, she told Fox News “They know they cannot control me, and that worries them very much”.</p>
      <p>Gabbard also made it clear that she is working in opposition to the president and voted alongside almost every other House Democrat in support of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911031077215982-whistleblower-behind-trump-impeachment-inquiry-offers-written-testimony-to-republicans/">the Trump impeachment process</a> on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Steve Bannon, who preceded Gabbard in an interview with Fox on Sunday, said she was "the type of person as a nation we want serving in the Cabinet”, due to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077209035-shes-a-beauty-trump-doubles-down-attack-on-clinton-over-her-claim-gabbard-is-russian-agent/">their shared views on foreign policy</a>.</p>
      <p>Clinton did not identify anyone by name but claimed that a Democratic candidate was being groomed by the Republicans, and was “the favourite of the Russians”.</p>
      <p>When she was asked if she was making a reference to Gabbard, Clinton replied “If the nesting doll fits..."</p>
      <p>Gabbard is one of an extensive line-up of Democrats running for the presidential nomination, making her stand-out appeal as a former soldier in opposition to regime-change wars waged by the US.</p>
      <p>The Clinton campaign made strong allegations, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910181077078414-trump-committed-fatal-mistake-by-involving-himself-in-russiagate-origins-probe/">colloquially known as "russiagate</a>", against then-Republican candidate Trump during the election, claiming that Russia was vying to bring about a Trump presidency. </p>
