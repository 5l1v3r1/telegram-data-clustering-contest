      <p>RESEDA, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A man was taken into custody Sunday after a car nearly crashed into a house in Reseda following an argument between the man and a female which escalated into a car chase.<br/><br/>Details surrounding the nature of the domestic dispute between the couple were not immediately available, but it ended with the woman driver barreling onto the yard of a home near the corner of Vanowen Street and Zelzah Avenue around 1 p.m., according to the Los Angeles Police Department.<br/><br/>Witnesses say the man was chasing the woman driver. The woman behind the wheel of the SUV rammed through a fence and short brick barrier and ended up on the front yard, managing to avoid causing any significant damage to the house.<br/><br/>The man was seen in handcuffs at the scene where the car crashed and the woman was reportedly taken to a hospital for unknown injuries. It's unclear exactly what caused the woman driver to lose control.</p>
