香港反送中支持者於昨（3日）中午，發起「七區開花」和平示威，不料晚間卻於太古城購物中心，發生一名男子持刀砍傷路人，甚至咬下香港民主黨議員耳朵，血濺現場，最後6人送醫，其中2人傷勢尤其嚴重。
根據香港媒體《立場新聞》報導，香港市民昨中午發起「七區開花」和平示威，反對警察暴行，包含沙田、屯門、旺角、金鐘、荃灣、大埔、黃大仙等地區紛紛響應。晚間7點左右，太古城購物中心的示威，突然闖入一名灰衣男子，持刀亂砍，有路人被砍傷腹部和背部倒臥路旁，傷勢極為嚴重，另有數人受到輕傷。
香港民主黨區議員趙家賢追問凶嫌為什麼要傷人，對方竟回應「不是我打人，我打狗」，趙家賢欲阻止凶嫌逃離時，凶嫌撲上趙家賢，用力咬住趙的左耳，硬生生咬下一部分，現場遺留一肉塊，還留下一灘血跡和一堆帶血的紙巾，趙家賢隨後被送往醫院治療。

當時旁觀的路人蜂擁而上，將凶手制伏在地，但因被路人赤手空拳或持鐵棍毆打「私了」，凶手頭部受傷，傷勢不輕。據調查指出，這起灰衣男子持刀砍人事件，共有6人受傷，其中2人傷勢嚴重，包含遭砍傷背部和腹部的男子，以及持刀行凶的嫌犯。衝突現場還留有一把利刃，但目前尚待釐清是誰所有。
香港民主黨區議員趙家賢自1996年居住於太古城，並於2008年出任東區區議會（太古城西）民選議員，已超過10年，將於本月24日舉行的區議會選舉爭取連任。
《自由時報》指出，有目擊者表示，凶嫌講中國大陸普通話，揮刀前還曾高喊「光復台灣」，並且隨身帶刀，判斷是親中國政府人士，而且是預謀襲擊。

04 Nov 2019, 01:57 by Xie Wenzhe
At the noon of yesterday (3rd), Hong Kong’s anti-delivery supporters launched a “seven districts flowering” peaceful demonstration. However, in the evening, at the Taikoo Shing Shopping Centre, a man with a knife cut a passerby and even bite the head of the Hong Kong Democratic Party. The blood was splashed on the scene, and the last six people were sent to the hospital. Two of them were particularly seriously injured.
According to the Hong Kong media ""Standing News"", Hong Kong people launched a ""seven districts flowering"" peaceful demonstration at noon yesterday against the police brutality, including Sha Tin, Tuen Mun, Mong Kok, Admiralty, Tsuen Wan, Tai Po and Wong Tai Sin. At around 7 o'clock in the evening, the demonstration at Taikoo Shing Shopping Center suddenly broke into a gray-shirted man and slashed with a knife. Some passers-by were cut down on the abdomen and the back was lying on the roadside. The injury was extremely serious and several others were slightly injured.
Zhao Jiaxian, a member of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, asked why the murderer was going to hurt people. The other party responded that ""I am not beating, I am a dog."" When Zhao Jiaxian wants to stop the murder, he is murdered by Zhao Jiaxian, biting Zhao’s left ear and biting hard. In the next section, a piece of meat was left on the scene, leaving a pool of blood and a pile of bloody tissue. Zhao Jiaxian was then taken to hospital for treatment.

At that time, the passers-by were rushing to the ground and the murderer was swayed to the ground. However, the murderer was injured in the head because of the bare hands or the iron bars. According to the investigation, the gray-shirted man had a knife-cutting incident. A total of 6 people were injured. Two of them were seriously injured, including men who had been chopped on the back and abdomen, and suspects who were murdered with a knife. There is still a sharp edge at the scene of the conflict, but it is still to be clarified who owns it.
Hong Kong Democratic Party Member Zhao Jiaxian has lived in Taikoo City since 1996 and was elected as an elected member of the Eastern District Council (Tai Koo Shing West) in 2008. He has been re-elected for more than 10 years in the District Council elections held on the 24th of this month.
The ""Free Times"" pointed out that witnesses said that the murderer spoke Mandarin in mainland China and shouted ""Recovering Taiwan"" before the knife. He took the knife with him and judged that he was a pro-China government and was a premeditated attack.
