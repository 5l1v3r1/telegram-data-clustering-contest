      <p>REUTERS: Brescia striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off the pitch after receiving alleged racist abuse from Hellas Verona fans during the teams’ Serie A meeting on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Italy international was left enraged by the chants coming from a section of the home support at the Stadio Bentegodi.</p>

      <p>Nine minutes into the second half, Balotelli stopped the game when he picked the ball up and volleyed it into the offending section of the stadium.</p>
      <p>He walked behind the goal before the striker’s team mates and opponents convinced him to stay on the field.</p>
      <p>The referee Maurizio Mariani stopped the game and a message was read out over the stadium loudspeaker threatening to suspend the match for a longer period if the chants continued.</p>
      <p>Play was on hold for around four minutes before continuing.</p>
      <p>Verona coach Ivan Juric denied hearing anything offensive from the stands.</p>
      <p>“I am not afraid to say there were no racist chants today," Juric told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
      <p>"They might have jeered and mocked the great player, but there was nothing there...</p>
      <p>“You can ask him, there was nothing there. I am disgusted by racist abuse and I will be the first to condemn it when it happens, but this was not it.</p>
      <p>“They provoked him with jeers and sarcastic chants, but they were not racist. Anything else is a lie."</p>
      <p>The game finished in a 2-1 victory for Verona, but Balotelli made his mark by scoring a superb strike with five minutes to go.</p>
      <p>It was the second time this weekend that a Serie A match has been interrupted because of offensive chants.</p>
      <p>AS Roma’s game against Napoli on Saturday was briefly halted because of discriminatory chants from the home supporters about the city of Naples.</p>
