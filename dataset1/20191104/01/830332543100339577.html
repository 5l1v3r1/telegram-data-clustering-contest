      <p>(CNN) - Pirates boarded a shipping vessel and kidnapped nine crew members off the coast of Benin in West Africa early Saturday morning, according to <a href="http://www.jjuc.no/">J.J. Ugland</a>, the Norwegian shipping company which owns the vessel.</p>
      <p>The ship, named the MV Bonita, was anchored and awaiting berth at the Cotonou port to discharge a shipment of gypsum when the pirates boarded, J.J. Ugland said in a statement Sunday.</p>
      <p>The remaining crew members contacted local authorities. The MV Bonita docked at the port later that day.</p>
      <p>An emergency response team from J.J. Ugland is working with authorities on the case.</p>
      <p>A report released in July from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), a nonprofit devoted to fighting maritime crime, has called <a href="https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/1279-seas-off-west-africa-world-s-worst-for-pirate-attacks-imb-reports">the Gulf of Guinea a "world piracy hotspot,"</a> saying that the "seas around West Africa remain the world's most dangerous for piracy."</p>
      <p>The report said 73% of all kidnappings at sea and 92% of hostage-takings took place in the Gulf of Guinea -- off the coasts of Nigeria, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Cameroon -- from January to June this year.</p>
