      <p>LAW firm Pinsent Masons has unveiled its new trainees for 2019-21, with another four recruits entering its award-winning programme.</p>
      <p>And the investment builds on a strong platform last year, with the firm announcing a 100 per cent retention rate for its quartet of 2017-19 students.</p>
      <p>Taking up their posts as newly-qualified solicitors are Danielle McKeefry (corporate), Hannah Megarry (property) and Lisa McGrady (litigation), while Rory Copeland (banking) joins the London office.</p>
      <p>Regan Martin, Ben McDowell, Aisling Taggart and Emma Swan have now commenced their training contract programmes.</p>
      <p>Belfast office head Andrea McIlroy-Rose said: "I'm delighted to see us maintain our strong level of investment in the lawyers of tomorrow. We pride ourselves in providing a first-rate training programme.</p>
      <p>"Our entrants start their experience with a trainee conference, where they have the opportunity to meet counterparts from other Pinsent Masons offices.</p>
      <p>"As well as properly structured legal training, we also provide broader skills training such as networking and client engagement. The programme is supported by a dedicated team ensuring that our people get the best out of the experience of training with us."</p>
      <p>Pinsent Masons has been recognised with a number of recent significant accreditations including No.1 LGBT+ employer in Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index and The Times' Top 50 Employers for Women.</p>
