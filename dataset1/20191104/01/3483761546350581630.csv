Irish stand-up comic Jimeoin touring around the Hunter and Central Coast in November and December

04 Nov 2019, 01:00

To some he is a true comedy legend. To others, he's the man with the best brows in the business.
However you see him, there is no denying that Jimeoin is downright hilarious.
The Irish stand-up comic is now touring his latest show, Result, around the Hunter and Central Coast in November and December with stops scheduled for Belmont, Hexham, Cessnock, Doyalson and New Lambton.
""It's just really a lot of nonsense and you're none the wiser at the end of it all,"" Jimeoin said of Result.
""It's just a daft show, that's the idea of it, and it's a fun show. It's not political and it never really has been political.
""It's an hour show that I hope people will come by and have a good laugh at. I haven't had a go at anybody other than myself.""



A prolific writer with an exceptional audience rapport, Jimeoin is known and loved for his brilliantly funny wit and charming observations on the absurdities of every-day life. He has been making international and Australian audiences laugh at his observations since the 1990s.
Jimeoin said he was still happy doing comedy after so many years.
""I'm happy with the longevity; that I could make a career out of comedy,"" he said.
An internationally-acclaimed performer, Jimeoin's regular appearances at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and his widely successful Australian tours often sell-out in advance.
Internationally, he has toured to great acclaim from New York to New Zealand, Aspen to Amsterdam, the Middle East to the Far East.
He has also performed around Europe and the UK and is a regular invitee to the Mecca of comedy, Montreal's Just For Laughs Festival.
He has also appeared regularly at the Adelaide and Melbourne Comedy Festivals, the Auckland Comedy Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival among others.


See Jimeoin at Belmont 16s on November 23, Hexham Bowling Club on November 28, Cessnock Leagues Club on November 29, Doyalson RSL on November 30 or Wests New Lambton on December 1.

Between 2005 and 2008, he was touring throughout the vast outback regions of Australia as well as playing the major cities and festivals across the land.
He was so well-received he became the first comedian to go and tour totally ""over the top"", playing a mix of hotels, theatres, swimming pools, cattle ranches and anywhere that looked a bit interesting.
This was filmed for a TV series on BBC Northern Ireland called Jimeoin Down Under.
