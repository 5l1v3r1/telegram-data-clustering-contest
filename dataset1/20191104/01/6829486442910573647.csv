Kanye Fans Are Calling His $80 ‘Brunchella’ Fiasco The New Fyre Festival
04 Nov 2019, 01:37 by Michelle Rennex
Kanye West has been no stranger to backlash in the past few weeks following the late-release of his ninth-studio album, Jesus is King, and the pretty questionable merch that came along with it.
He can’t seem to catch a break either — his latest album promo rollout has been dubbed Fyre Festival 2.0 after he charged $55USD (that’s $80AUD) for a wildly lacklustre ‘Brunchella’ experience that was offered as a VIP extra to a free outdoor service in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
A ‘Brunchella’ attendee, Kimberly Kinchen, shared an image on Facebook of the abysmal offerings on the day, which included pale sausage, stiff pancakes, cold grits, eggs and bacon served on styrofoam plates.
“This is the wonderful and COLD brunch BUFFET we are being served by Boil & Roux BR,” she wrote. “I want my coins back for a general admission ticket.”



According to the event promoter, Adrian Hammond, the show was meant to start at 7pm and the brunch buffet was set to be served from 5pm, which, let’s be honest, is a very strange time for brunch.
The funds from the ‘buffet’, a term used very loosely here, was said to fundraise for the church — however, concert-goers, understandably, expected a little more bang for their buck, likening the food to THAT infamous plate from Fyre Festival.



According to Hammond, 6,000 free tickets were given out and 2,000 VIP brunch tickets were sold. But with the sheer number of tickets given out, it’s really no surprise that so many ‘VIP brunch’ passes were bought for the Bethany Church event with the chance of getting closer to the stage.
But fans who attended the service shared that the supposed “VIP” part of the experience was totally misrepresented with their view being the same as those with free passes, if not worse.



Predictably, the internet gleefully watched ‘Brunchella’ unfold from afar, and proceeded to go in hard.









Honestly, this sad, sad meal really is only made worse by Kanye’s recent revelation that he just received $68 million back on his tax return. But hey, at least it was all for charity, right?
