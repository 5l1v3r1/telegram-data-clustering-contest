04 Nov 2019, 07:00 by Andy Hall

As the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall approaches on 9 November, photographer Andy Hall visits the once-divided capital




Visitors mingle at Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous crossing point between East and West Berlin during the cold war



Since the wall came down the area around Checkpoint Charlie has become a major tourist attraction



A couple study a display of cold war photos from the comfort of an old armchair



The wall had seven official crossing points, the most famous being Checkpoint Charlie, which was located in the heart of Berlin in a sector secured by American troops



In a high-stakes standoff at the checkpoint in October 1961, the US and Soviet militaries stared each other down for several hours in a dispute over an attempt by the US diplomat Allan Lightner to visit East Berlin



Berliners enjoy the late sun in Mauerpark, a popular leisure area on land that used to be a heavily guarded ‘death strip’ during the cold war



Enjoying the late sun in Mauerpark



An 800m strip of the wall still stands on part of a steep embankment in the park



Potsdamer Platz. During the cold war, this was the widest point of Berlin’s notorious death strip



After decades of neglect, Potsdamer Platz has become a large, thriving urban hub



Potsdamer Platz



Potsdamer Platz once hosted a performance by Pink Floyd



Small sections of the original wall dot the area around Potsdamer Platz



The Baywatch star David Hasselhoff makes an appearance with a fleet of Lada cars. Hasselhoff holds a barely believable iconic status in Germany. He performed his No 1 hit Looking for Freedom on New Year’s Eve 1989, two months after the Berlin Wall came down. The song became an anthem of hope for the people of East Germany during the 1980s



The Brandenberg Gate is illuminated during a light festival before the 30th anniversary of the wall coming down



A wedding party at Brandenburg Gate



Located on Bernauer Strasse in the centre of Berlin, the Berlin war memorial is the central site recalling German division



The memorial extends along 1.4km of the former strip and is the only section of the Berlin Wall to be preserved in its most complete original form



Visitors look at a memorial of remembrance to the victims of the Wall



The construction of the wall either side of Bernauer Strasse split families, resulting in numerous attempts to escape



People pose in front of a painting of cold war allies Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev at the East Side gallery, which consists of a series of murals and artworks painted directly onto a 2km stretch of the remnants of the original Berlin Wall situated in the centre of Berlin



The East Side gallery



On the night of 5 October 1961, Udo Düllick attempted to flee across the Spree River from East to West Berlin, He was discovered by East German border guards as he was swimming and was fired upon. He drowned before he could make it to the West Berlin side of the riverbank, seen here.
