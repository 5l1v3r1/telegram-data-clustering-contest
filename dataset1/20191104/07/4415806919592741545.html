      <p>The full inquest into the death of murdered student Jastine Valdez will open later today.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was abducted in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow in May 2018.</p>
      <p>A previous hearing heard that Jastine Valdez died of asphyxia.</p>
      <p>She had been abducted in broad daylight on a busy road in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow on May 19. 2018.</p>
      <p>A witness who saw the 24-year-old being forced into the boot of a Nissan Qashqai rang 999.</p>
      <p>Gardaí put out a national appeal for the car, and 45-year-old Mark Hennessy was identified as the owner of the Qashqai.</p>
      <p>He was killed by a garda bullet when he was apprehended in Cherrywood the following day.</p>
      <p>The body of Jastine Valdez was discovered on May 21 in dense woodland at Rathmichael, south Dublin.</p>
      <p>The inquest into her death had been adjourned to allow for a GSOC investigation to take place.</p>
      <p>In June, the coroner’s court heard that the Garda who shot Mr Hennessey <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/dpp-recommends-no-prosecution-against-detective-who-shot-jastine-valdezs-killer-928906.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">would not face discipline or prosecution</a> and the investigation was now closed.</p>
