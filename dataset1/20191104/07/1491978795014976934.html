      <p>Donald Trump has waded into British politics again, addressing the key question facing pro-leave right-wingers in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/mps-pledge-to-stop-abusive-language-during-general-election">the forthcoming general election</a>.</p>
      <p>The president said he hoped prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, a “wonderful guy”, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would come together on a united political platform.</p>
      <p>The president spoke to reporters at the White House after returning from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/donald-trump-ufc-retweet-jorge-masvidal-new-york-city-boos-cheers">a visit to New York to watch a UFC fight</a>, an evening which produced both boos and cheers and stoked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/donald-trump-ufc-retweet-jorge-masvidal-new-york-city-boos-cheers">fierce debate on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked which British politician he would side with if he had to choose, Trump said: “I like them both … So I think Boris will get it right. They’re both friends of mine. What I’d like to see is for Nigel and Boris to come together. I think that’s a possibility.”</p>
      <p>Farage said on Sunday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/nigel-farage-says-he-will-not-stand-for-mp-in-general-election-brexit-party">he would not run</a> for a seat in the general election. Johnson has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/01/boris-johnson-dismisses-trump-and-farages-suggestion-of-pact-with-the-brexit-party-video">already rejected the suggestion</a> from both Trump and Farage that he should work with the Brexit party.</p>
      <p>Instead, Johnson has talked up the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US as one of the biggest prizes of leaving the European Union.</p>
      <p>Trump said: “Boris is the right man for the time. He’s really for the times. He’s a great gentleman. He’s a wonderful guy. He’s tough, he’s smart and I think he’s going to do something.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to Farage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/oct/31/corbyn-would-be-so-bad-for-your-country-trump-tells-farage-video">on the British politician’s LBC radio show</a> earlier this week, Trump said Johnson’s proposed Brexit deal would prevent the UK and US from striking a trade deal of their own and described the situation as “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-brexit-deal-precludes-us-uk-trade-agreement/">completely ridiculous</a>”. Downing Street <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-boris-johnsons-brexit-plan-could-rule-out-uk-us-trade-deal-2019-11">rejected</a> that claim.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, Trump indicated that if the UK made a clean break with Europe, as opposed to remaining in the customs union in any form, the US would be in a better position to strike a trade deal.</p>
      <p>“We’re far and away the No1 economy in the world,” Trump said, “and, if you do it a certain way, we’re prohibited from trading with the UK. That would be very bad for the UK because we can do much more business than the European Union.”</p>
      <p>In his broadcast conversation with Farage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/oct/31/corbyn-would-be-so-bad-for-your-country-trump-tells-farage-video">on</a> Thursday, Trump also disparaged the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>In response, Corbyn <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1189965486638981121">tweeted</a>: “Donald Trump is trying to interfere in Britain’s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected.”</p>
