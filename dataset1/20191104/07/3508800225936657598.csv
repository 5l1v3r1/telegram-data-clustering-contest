2歲男童從奧萬大吊橋縫隙摔落不治，廠商上月曾「目測」檢查
04 Nov 2019, 07:13 by 李修慧


我們想讓你知道的是奧萬大森林遊樂區育樂課楊課長表示，「8月時有對吊橋進行安全檢查，而10月時合約廠商則有用目測的方式做檢查，但也並非是專業的橋梁檢查」。



昨（3）日一對父母帶小孩走奧萬大吊橋，2歲男童跌坐護欄與橋面之間縫隙，最後直接摔落70公尺深的溪床，送醫不治。奧萬大森林遊樂區育樂課楊課長表示，8月針對吊橋進行安全檢查後，「10月時廠商則有用目測的方式做檢查，也並非是專業的橋梁檢查」。而南投縣政府觀光處人員表示，吊橋護欄下方與橋面至少每10公分就要綁一個固結點，這次發生幼童從吊橋墜落事件，即有可能是固結點鬆開未發現。
男童摔落70公尺深河谷，送醫不治
（中央社）一名許姓男童昨（3）日與父母走奧萬大吊橋時，從護欄與橋面縫隙摔下溪床死亡，許父今天說，妻子全程牽兒子手，一陣強風造成吊橋搖晃大，兒子就從縫隙摔落，並未放任男童自己走。
年約2歲的男童昨天與父母等親友一行10多人到林務局南投林區管理處所轄的奧萬大國家森林遊樂區遊玩，男童走過園內奧萬大吊橋時，疑從木板橋面與金屬護欄間縫隙摔落70多公尺深溪床，男童獲救時已失去生命徵象，經送到台中榮民總醫院埔里分院急救仍不治。
南投地方檢察署今天上午指派檢察官會同法醫到醫院相驗男童遺體，並詢問家屬了解案發過程；由於男童父親民國102年以空軍上士軍階退役，榮民服務處也派員關心需求；男童父親與母親則在檢察官抵達前回到醫院，許父同意在不露出影像下接受媒體訪問。
酸民指責父母「沒顧好孩子」，父親澄清：全程牽著小孩
許姓男童父親說，他昨天牽大兒子走前面，妻子牽小兒子走後面，從頭到尾未放手，走過吊橋時，突然一陣強風吹來，吊橋搖晃較大，男童跌坐護欄與橋面之間縫隙，「屁股跌坐，整個身體折下去」，母親趴下沒拉住兒子的手，全程目睹孩子摔下溪床，撞到石頭。
許父說，事情發生後，網路很多酸民指責「為何沒顧好孩子」，甚至妻子接到很多騷擾電話，讓他們感覺由受害者變成加害者，甚至有酸民還誣指他們要詐領保險金，「但請問15歲以下的小孩能獲得理賠嗎」，他的妻子從事保險業，難道會不知道。
昨天傳出家屬向警方說，放男童自己走才發生意外，但許父今天反駁強調，他們從來沒向警方這樣說，不知道消息從哪邊出來，「我們怎麼可能讓孩子自己在那邊跑，怎麼可能」，案發後妻子已經非常難過，面對外界許多不實言論和指責，真的很擔心妻子想不開。
許父表示，事情發生後，除一邊確定兒子位置並打電話報案，他也檢查10多個區塊護欄是否牢固，發現就只有男童跌落的這個縫隙最鬆，他當場要求園方封鎖現場，以免再有人跌落發生憾事，「我兒子已犧牲生命，我們已經很難過，希望酸民不要再落井下石」。
《華視》報導，許父強調，事發地點前後20公尺的防護網都很堅固，唯獨摔落處輕輕一推就出現寬20幾公分，長1公尺多的縫隙。
許父說到後來眼眶泛淚表示，兒子接受急救當下，看到兒子模樣，就表明「不要再急救了，讓兒子好好休息、好好走」，為何外界可以這麼過分，「是要逼到我們全家都走是不是」。目前只希望兒子儘快入土為安、好好休息，可以的話，再來當他們小孩。
奧萬大吊橋全長180公尺、高約90公尺，採吊床式設計，吊橋橋面兩側都有140公分高硬質安全護網，每個月由巡視人員檢視設施情況，為配合檢警調查，吊橋已拉起封鎖線封閉，南投地檢署相驗男童遺體後，再前往奧萬大現場勘驗。

10月份完成「目測」檢查，南投縣表示「應該用拳頭測試」
《自由時報》報導，林務局南投林管處表示，奧萬大吊橋於民國98年7月落成，每月都會由巡視人員檢視設施情況，10月份才委外完成安全檢查，吊橋將暫時封閉，進行全面安全檢查，將確認安全無虞後再行開放通行。
《ETtoday》報導，對此，奧萬大森林遊樂區育樂課楊課長表示，「8月時有去對吊橋進行安全檢查，而10月時合約廠商則有用目測的方式做檢查，但也並非是專業的橋梁檢查」但他也表示，「橋梁的設計都有符合安全規範，防護網是特別加裝的，法規並沒有特別規定這部分」。另外，對於相關單位究責與檢討部分，楊課長則表示，「這起事故究竟是使用者使用不當 、或吊橋零件鬆脫，尚在調查釐清。」
《自由時報》報導，但南投縣政府觀光處人員表示，吊橋護欄下方與橋面至少每10公分就要綁一個固結點，通常用1個成人拳頭來測試是否合格，若拳頭能穿透即不合格，這次發生幼童從吊橋墜落事件，即有可能是固結點鬆開未發現。
而根據台灣採購公報網，林務局南投林管處最近一次針對奧萬大吊橋標案為「108年天池山莊附近崩塌地、奧萬大吊橋、楓林步道0.7K及14條步道監測委託技術服務」 ，決標廠商為去年同樣得標的統揚工程技術顧問有限公司，履約時間從今年4月9日～今年12月31日，決標金額為70萬元。而根據政府採購資訊網，統揚工程民國105年開始就承包多項吊橋檢測案子。
全台18處森林遊樂區，農委會承諾全面檢查基礎設施
《中央社》報導，時代力量立委徐永明今天在立法院經濟委員會中就詢問，政府的政策鼓勵國人在國內旅遊，但是否有注意到國家森林遊樂區中的安全問題。列席備詢的農委會主委陳吉仲表示，對這次事件所造成的不幸，他感到遺憾，所有國家遊樂區的門票，有涵蓋相關的意外保險，因此會有410萬元的保險。陳吉仲也承諾，會要求林務局做全面性的盤點，確定國家森林遊樂區中基礎設施的安全性。
根據林務局官網，目前全台有18處森林遊樂區。北部區域包括滿月圓、內洞、東眼山、觀霧與太平山等森林遊樂區；中部區域包括武陵、合歡山、大雪山、八仙山、奧萬大等森林遊樂區；南部區域包括阿里山、藤枝、雙流與墾丁等森林遊樂區；東部區域則包括池南、富源、向陽與知本等森林遊樂區。
