      <p>The fiancee of TV chef Jean-Christophe Novelli has said that their three-year-old son may never talk.</p>
      <p>Michelle Kennedy has three sons with Novelli, her partner for the past 11 years, including Valentino, who has already overcome cancer and has been diagnosed with autism.</p>
      <p>She told Hello! magazine: “We’re having to accept that he may be non-verbal, which is very sad.</p>
      <p>“He can’t even say ‘Mummy’, which is heartbreaking.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy recently missed the wedding of Novelli’s daughter Christina so she could stay at home with their son, who was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma at just six weeks old.</p>

      <p>His daughter, 32, from his first marriage to wife Tina, tied the knot with music manager Tara Sirrell in a clifftop ceremony on the Greek island of Santorini.</p>
      <p>The TV star, who gave her away, said: “It was the perfect wedding. It was so romantic, like watching a movie.</p>
      <p>“It’s beautiful to see two people who are so in love and all the people there were the perfect ingredients of the most amazing recipe.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I was so proud because, even though she’s an adult now, my daughter is still my baby.”</p>
      <p>Christina, who is a singer and songwriter, continued: “It was like a fairytale.</p>
      <p>“Dad was great. He’d walked down the aisle with me and then, when Tara was walking down, dad ended up behind her, carrying her train.”</p>
