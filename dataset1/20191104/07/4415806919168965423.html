      <p>The Chicago Bulls slipped to a 2-5 record after losing 108-95 to the Indiana Pacers.</p>
      <p>For the Pacers, who had three starters sidelined by injury, it was a third straight win after opening the season with three consecutive losses.</p>
      <p>TJ Warren scored a season-high 26 points for the Pacers as the Bulls failed to take advantage of Indiana’s makeshift team.</p>
      <p>The Pacers have moved up to seventh on the Eastern Conference table, while the Bulls are third from bottom.</p>

      <p>In Miami, the Heat beat the Houston Rockets 129-100, fuelled by an astonishing first quarter which ended with the home side leading 46-14.</p>
      <p>The only bigger leads after one quarter since the shot clock was started in 1954 were when the Los Angeles Lakers led the Kings 40-4 after one quarter on February 4, 1987, and the Baltimore Bullets leading the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 45-12 after one quarter on December 9, 1972.</p>
      <p>The Heat’s third win in a row leaves them on 5-1 and second in the Eastern Conference, while the Rockets (3-3) are ninth in the Western.</p>
