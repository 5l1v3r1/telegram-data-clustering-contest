Under Armour did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment outside regular business hours.
Last month, Under Armour said longtime Chief Executive Officer Kevin Plank was stepping down from the role next year, handing the reins of the sportswear maker to operations head Patrik Frisk, in an attempt to help battle brutal competition from Nike Inc and Adidas AG in the United States.
