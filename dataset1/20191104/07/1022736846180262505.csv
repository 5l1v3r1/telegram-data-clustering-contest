Mkataba wa amani hatarini Msumbiji
04 Nov 2019, 07:29 by RFI

Tume ya uchaguzi nchini Msumbiji, imekiri kuwa kuliwepo na dosari kadhaa wakati wa uchaguzi mkuu uliofanyika Oktoba 25, ambapo rais Filipe Nyusi alichaguliwa kwa muhula wa pili.

Kauli hii ya tume imekuja baada ya chama kikuu cha upinzani nchini humo, RENAMO, Jumatano ya wiki hii kufungua kesi katika Mahakama ya Katiba kupinga ushindi wa rais Nyusi, kikitaka uchaguzi huo ufutwe.
Awali kituo cha umma cha masuala ya uadilifu CIP kimetowa ripoti inayosema, uchaguzi huo umekumbwa na taarifa za masanduku kujazwa kura kabla hata ya zoezi la upigaji kura pamoja na kuzuiwa kwa waangalizi kufanya kazi zao.
Chama tawala cha Frelimo kimetuhumiwa kufanya udanganyifu katika orodha ya wapiga kura waliojiandikisha katika ngome zake. Kituo cha CIP pia kinadai yalikuwepo pia majaribio ya kuwazuia waangalizi huru wa uchaguzi kufanya kazi zao kwa kuwanyima vibali vya kuingia kwenye maeneo ya upigaji kura katika mikoa kadhaa.
Kituo cha kusimamia uadilifu CIP kinasema wajumbe wake wameripoti visa vya kutokea jaribio la masanduku ya kura kujazwa kura  na kwamba kuna watu kadhaa waliokamatwa wakiwa na karatasi za ziada za kupigia kura ambazo zilikuwa zimeshajazwa jina la chama cha Frelimo na mgombea wake wa urais.
Hatua hii ya upinzani kukataa kutambua matokeo ya uchaguzi huo, kunauweka pabaya mkataba wa amani uliotiwa saini kati ya Chama tawala FRELIMO na Chama cha RENAMO ambacho kimetokana na waasi wa zamani.
Takwimu zilizotolewa na Tume ya Uchaguzi Nchini Msumbiji zinaonesha kwamba, Rais Nyusi alipata kura asilimia 73% ya kura zote halali zilizopigwa na mpinzani wake Bwana Ossufo Momade wa RENAMO akajinyakulia kura asilimia 22% za kura zote. Upinzani walikataa kukubaliana na matokeo haya kwa misingi kwamba, uchaguzi ulifanyika katika hali ya vitisho pamoja na “wizi wa kura”.
Hivi karibuni, Chama cha FRELIMO kiliwekeana tena saini Mkataba wa Amani na Chama cha RENAMO ambacho kwa sasa kinaongozwa na Bwana Ossufo Momade. Lengo ni kusitisha vita na mashambulizi dhidi ya watu wasiokuwa na hatia; pamoja na kuhakikisha kwamba, ulinzi na usalama wa Msumbiji unaendelea kuimarishwa.

Mozambican peace treaty threatened
04 Nov 2019, 07:29 by RFI

The electoral commission in Mozambique has acknowledged that there were a number of shortcomings during the general elections held on October 25, when president Filipe Nyusi was elected for the second term.

The commission's statement came after the country's main opposition party, RENAMO, on Wednesday this week filed a lawsuit in the Constitutional Court to oppose President Nyusi's victory, calling for the elections to be canceled.
Earlier, the CIP public information center has released a report saying the elections have been filled with ballot boxes before the voting exercise as well as the ban on observers.
Frelimo's ruling party has been accused of defrauding the list of registered voters in its castles. The CIP Center also claims that there were also attempts to stop independent election observers from denying them access to polling stations in several regions.
The Center for Custody CIP says its members have reported cases of ballot boxes being filled up and that there were several people arrested with additional ballot papers that had already been filled in by the name of Frelimo's party and its presidential candidate.
This opposition to refusing to recognize the outcome of the election, undermines the peace treaty signed between the ruling FRELIMO and the RENAMO Party which is based on former rebels.
Statistics released by the Electoral Commission in Mozambique show that President Nyusi got 73% of the total votes cast by his opponent Mr Ossufo Momade of RENAMO and won 22% of the vote. Opposition refused to agree to the findings on the basis that, elections were held in a state of terror as well as ""theft of votes"".
Recently, the FRELIMO Party re-signed the Peace Agreement with the RENAMO Party, which is currently headed by Mr Ossufo Momade. The goal is to stop the war and attack against innocent people; as well as ensuring that Mozambique's protection and security continues to be strengthened.
