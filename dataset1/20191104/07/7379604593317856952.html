You can't say that wasn't a rhinestoned rollercoaster, can you? Will Mike make it back for another week? Will Anton ever shut up? Will Tess ever learn any new words? Will Claudia ever cut her fringe? We hope not. See you next week for more ballroom bantzzz. KEEP READING…. WE MEAN…. DANCING. Cha-cha-cheerio for now.</li>

Young people. Happy and carefree. Their time will come when they can't run without a sports bra and make debilitating noises when they crouch down. Enjoy it for now, Saff and Aj. Also, well done.</li>

Looking forward to a ‘dizzy’ week- Viennese waltz.” Not quite sure what Claudia Winkle's 'area' is though… Is it a VIP area?</li>
