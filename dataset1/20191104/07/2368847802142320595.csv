大自然因地制宜發揮無盡的巧思創意，淋漓盡致地展示著其卓然超群的調色才華，繪製出一幅幅濃妝艷抹或淡粧素雅的畫作。
紅艷艷的秋色，不亞於春花美景，而盛開的芒草素雅清淡的色彩也一樣吸睛。

Nature's ingenuity and ingenuity in the local conditions show its outstanding color palette and draw a painting with a heavy makeup or a light makeup.
The bright autumn colors are not as good as the beauty of the spring flowers, but the light colors of the blooming Miscanthus are also eye-catching.
