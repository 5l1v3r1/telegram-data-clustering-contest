      <p>The New England Patriots suffered their first defeat of the season as they were beaten 37-20 by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Patriots were 8-0 heading into the game at M&amp;T Bank Stadium but found Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson in inspired form.</p>
      <p>Jackson, who completed 17 of 23 passes, threw for 163 yards and rushed for 61, racking up three total touchdowns.</p>

      <p>The Ravens now sit top of the AFC North on 6-2, while the Patriots remain at the summit of the AFC East.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles made it back-to-back wins by beating the Chicago Bears 22-14 at home.</p>
      <p>Running back Jordan Howard’s 13-yard touchdown against his former team in the third quarter helped his current side to victory despite a late fightback from the Bears, who at one point trailed 19-0.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are now 5-4 and lie second in the NFC East, while the loss sees the Bears on 3-5 and rooted to the bottom of the NFC North.</p>

      <p>In Kansas City, the Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings 26-23.</p>
      <p>The home side had to play, for the second week in a row, without injured reigning MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</p>
      <p>However, Harrison Butker scored a game-winning 44-yard field goal minutes after hitting a 54-yard field goal that levelled the game.</p>
      <p>The Chiefs and Vikings are both now on 6-3, with the former on top of the AFC West table and the latter lying second in the NFC North.</p>

      <p>However, he missed and the Colts (5-3) now trail the Houston Texans (6-3) in the AFC South.</p>
