      <p>Lakshmi noted that she was lucky to have the show made, but, like anything in life—it has its challenges. She wrote that she’s away a lot and just overwhelmed at times. She wrote that her daughter’s costume was "kick ass," but she didn’t have the energy to work on her own.</p>

      <p>“As moms we try to do it all and often put more pressure on ourselves than others. It’s been intensely stressful balancing it all lately. I even cried. More than once. Luckily I found this mask to hide behind,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Many followers on Instagram thanked the star for being so honest about her struggles. </p>
