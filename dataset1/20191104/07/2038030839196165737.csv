Seville - Billie Eilish won best newcomer and best song for Bad Guy at the MTV Europe Music Awards on Sunday, while Ariana Grande failed to bag any of her seven nominations.
Taylor Swift won best video for ME! and Canadian singer Shawn Mendes took home best artist at the star-studded evening in Seville, Spain that also gave a special ""Rock Icon"" award to Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and saw Korean boy band sensation BTS take home three gongs.
""Hi MTV EMA, I want to say thank you so much for winning the best song, I love you,"" 17-year old Eilish said in a pre-recorded video.
