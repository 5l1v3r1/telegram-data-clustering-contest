中共拋對台26措施　民進黨：台灣人民不可能上當
04 Nov 2019, 07:56 by 黃揚明, 賴智揚
針對中共國台辦今（4日）公布對台26條措施，民進黨抨擊，在大選前提出26條措施，可見中國是有計畫地介入台灣選舉，選前釋放這些措施，是中共的「司馬昭之心」，且只想把台灣鎖進「一國兩制」框架中，台灣人民不可能上當。
民進黨批評，中國「措施越多騙越多」，因為去年拋出「對台31條措施」，但成效不彰，這次在選前再釋放「26條措施」，企圖拉攏台灣投資。但民進黨先前已警告，各界應提高警覺，選前釋放這些措施，是中共的司馬昭之心，連國中生都不會上當。
根據經濟部投審會統計，2018年台商年赴中投資較2017年同期減少8.2％；赴中國工作和求學的台灣民眾也在逐年衰退。民進黨指出，中國的「優惠措施」完全不敵中國嚴重衰退的經濟環境。
此外，民進黨認為，台灣應以香港作為前車之鑑，因為1997年香港回歸後，中共同樣企圖透過各種優惠措施收買香港人，給予香港人民和中國人民的同等待遇和各種經濟優惠，但實際香港在「一國兩制」下，如今已是優惠盡失，弊多於利。
民進黨指出，中共想把香港那一套「一國兩制」下的「同等待遇」複製在「台灣方案」上，台灣人民不可能上當。
民進黨還批，中共一字一句還是只想把台灣鎖進「一國兩制台灣方案」框架中，且中共在國際上處處打壓台灣參與國際社會空間，行徑完全是惡霸行為，在台灣選前卻突然要提供外館協助，也未曾和我國官方有任何正式協定，此舉無異是將台灣人民當成中國人民，極度輕蔑與不尊重，「我們感到非常不以為然」。
總統府發言人丁允恭也表示，兩岸應正向交流、對等互惠，不應名為惠台，實為鎖台。這次的「26條措施」，實際上是「一國兩制台灣方案」的行動方案，中國意圖以此框架台灣，也損害台灣人民實質利益。
丁允恭表示，從過去實證檢驗，中國宣稱的效益有限，並未為台灣人民帶來真正實益，只是成為分化台灣社會、擾亂台灣人心、干預台灣民主選舉的政治手段。
他指出，中國一手號稱提供外館協助，一手卻打壓我國外交發展；又或是一邊宣稱歡迎運動員赴中參賽，另一邊卻在更重要的國際賽事打壓台灣。稱此為惠台，更凸顯出虛假與諷刺。
丁允恭也正告中國政府應停止對台灣的打壓、放棄「一國兩制台灣方案」的政治前提，如此方為兩岸發展正道，真正促進和平穩定，也對兩岸人民有真實助益。

The CCP throws measures against Taiwan. The DPP: the people of Taiwan cannot be fooled.
04 Nov 2019, 07:56 by Huang Yangming, Lai Zhiyang
In response to the announcement of the 26 measures against Taiwan by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Chinese Communist Party, the DPP attacked and proposed 26 measures before the election. It can be seen that China has planned to intervene in Taiwan’s elections and release these measures before the election. It is the CCP’s ""Sima Zhao's heart"", and only want to lock Taiwan into the ""one country, two systems"" framework, the people of Taiwan cannot be fooled.
The Democratic Progressive Party criticized China's ""more measures to deceive more and more"" because last year, ""31 measures against Taiwan"" were thrown out, but the results were not good. This time, before the election, ""26 measures"" were released in an attempt to attract Taiwan investment. However, the DPP has previously warned that all walks of life should be vigilant. The release of these measures before the election is the heart of the CCP’s Sima Zhao, and even the Chinese students will not be fooled.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Taiwanese investment in Taiwan in the year of 2018 decreased by 8.2% compared with the same period in 2017; the Taiwanese people who went to work and study in China are also declining year by year. The DPP pointed out that China's ""preferential measures"" completely defeated China's severe economic recession.
In addition, the DPP believes that Taiwan should use Hong Kong as a lesson. Since the return of Hong Kong in 1997, the CCP has also attempted to buy Hong Kong people through various preferential measures, giving the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese people the same treatment and various economic concessions. Under ""One Country, Two Systems"", it is now a loss of concessions and more harm than good.
The DPP pointed out that the CCP wants to copy the ""equal treatment"" under Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" on the ""Taiwan Plan"". The people of Taiwan cannot be fooled.
The DPP also approved that the Chinese Communist Party still only wants to lock Taiwan into the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"" framework, and the CCP has suppressed Taiwan's participation in international social space everywhere. The act is completely bully, but suddenly before Taiwan's election. To provide assistance to the foreign pavilion, and to have no formal agreement with the Chinese government, this move is tantamount to treating the people of Taiwan as the Chinese people, extremely contemptuous and disrespectful. ""We feel very disapproving.""
The presidential palace spokesman Ding Yungong also said that the two sides should exchange exchanges and reciprocity, and should not be called Huitai. This ""26 measures"" is actually an action plan for the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"". China intends to frame Taiwan and harm the Taiwan people's real interests.
Ding Yungong said that from the empirical test in the past, China's declared benefits are limited, and it has not brought real benefits to the people of Taiwan. It has only become a political means of differentiating Taiwanese society, disrupting the hearts of Taiwanese people, and interfering in Taiwan's democratic elections.
He pointed out that China has allegedly provided assistance from foreign libraries, but it has suppressed China's diplomatic development. It has also announced that it welcomes athletes to participate in the competition, while the other side is suppressing Taiwan in more important international events. Calling this Huitai, it highlights the false and ironic.
Ding Yungong also told the Chinese government that it should stop the suppression of Taiwan and give up the political premise of the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"". This will lead to the development of the right path for the two sides of the strait, truly promote peace and stability, and also have real benefits for the people on both sides of the strait.
