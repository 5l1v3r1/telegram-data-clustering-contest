In case you missed any of Sunday night's action at the Circuit of the Americas or what unfolded after, we have you covered as we break down the main stories from Sunday.

Bottas takes US Grand Prix as Hamilton seals title
Lewis Hamilton only needed four points or he needed Valtteri Bottas not to win to clinch his third consecutive championship and his sixth overall.
Bottas did win the race as the Finn drove an excellent race, but Hamilton finished just behind him, meaning the 34-year-old is now the second driver ever to have won six Formula 1 championships after Michael Schumacher.
The race saw Max Verstappen finish in third and Charles Leclerc in fourth place, with the other Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel retiring early as the German's suspension snapped after just nine laps of the race. Sergio Perez, who started from the pitlane, did ever so well to finish in P10.

Leclerc added he thought Verstappen was joking, although his tone certainly didn't suggest so. The two 22-year-olds are certainly developing a rivalry in front of our eyes!
