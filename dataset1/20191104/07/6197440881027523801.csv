Gmail gives you built-in categories to better organize your inbox. These categories include primary, social, promotions, forums, and updates. On the web, these categories display as tabs across the top of Gmail while on your mobile device, they display as options in the menu. These categories can be helpful, but if there is one or two that you never use, they can just get in the way. In this short tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to add or remove categories and tabs in Gmail.

Just follow these steps to add or remove categories in Gmail on the web.

Click the Settings button near the top right near your profile photo which looks like a gear icon.

Next to Categories, uncheck those that you no longer want to see in your inbox and leave those checked that you want.
Optionally, you can mark the checkbox for Include starred in Primary. If you enable this option, starred emails from all tabs will appear in the Primary tab.
When you finish, scroll to the bottom and hit the Save Changes




You’ll then head back to your inbox and should see the category and tab changes you just made.
