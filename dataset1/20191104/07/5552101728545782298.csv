團購氣炸鍋付錢卻流標　團購主神隱民眾「氣炸」
04 Nov 2019, 07:16 by 李育材
團購正夯，不過卻有小資民眾遇上詐騙！有團購主在網路上徵求團購60台氣炸鍋，達標後仍繼續徵求其他人跟團，卻因文章違規遭版主刪除，等同團購流標。這名團購主原本允諾2日內歸還費用給買家，不過此後神隱，還留下假電話，更將PTT帳號轉賣他人，讓多名被害人既錯愕又憤怒。
一名住台北市的劉姓業務，上網瀏覽PTT時，看到合購版上有標題為《比依陶瓷氣炸鍋－賣家直送》徵求團購文，徵求60台氣炸鍋。劉男跟進後，便收到帳號「suxfish」的團購主寄的匯款通知信給他和92位團員，請大家確認訂購資訊，並提供其匯款帳號、姓名及手機，請大家盡速匯款。
劉男立即以網路銀行轉帳新台幣2,307元給對方，發現該篇文章違反版規遭刪，「suxfish」也再度發信表示會統一退款。然而過了通知日期，團員們均未收到款款項，撥打該團購主的手機，發現其留的根本是假資料，才驚覺遭到詐騙。
刑事局分析，歹徒通常利用時下最熱門的商品吸引民眾購買，或開設團購以低價吸引網友購買，再誘導民眾透過臉書或LINE私下交易，表示可先付金，事後再面交付餘款，待買家將款項匯入指定戶頭後，就已讀不回、封鎖帳號。呼籲民眾在搶便宜的同時，勿忽略網拍購物詐騙陷阱。

The group purchases the gas fryer to pay the money but the flow label
04 Nov 2019, 07:16 by Li Yucai
Group buying is right, but there are bourgeois people who are facing fraud! Some group purchasers rushed to buy 60 sets of gas fryers on the Internet. After reaching the standard, they continued to solicit other people to follow the group, but they were deleted by the moderator due to the violation of the article. The group purchaser originally promised to return the fee to the buyer within 2 days, but after that, Shenyin also left a fake call, and resold the PTT account to others, so that many victims were both wrong and angry.
A surnamed Liu, who lives in Taipei City, browsed PTT when he was online. He saw that the title of the purchase was titled ""Biyi Ceramic Fryer-Seller Direct Delivery"" and asked for group purchases, soliciting 60 gas fryers. After Liu Man followed up, he received a remittance letter from the group owner of the account ""suxfish"" and 92 members. Please confirm the order information and provide the remittance account number, name and mobile phone. Please send the money as soon as possible.
Liu Nan immediately transferred the NT$2,307 to the other party by online banking. He found that the article was deleted in violation of the rules. ""Suxfish"" also sent a letter to express a unified refund. However, after the notice date, the members of the group did not receive the payment, dialed the mobile phone of the group's purchaser, and found that the information they left was false information, only to be surprised.
The Criminal Bureau analyzed that gangsters usually use the hottest products to attract people to buy, or set up group purchases to attract netizens to buy at low prices, and then induce people to privately trade through Facebook or LINE, indicating that they can pay the money first, and then pay the balance afterwards. After the buyer remits the money to the designated account, it will not read back and block the account. Appeal to the public while robbing the cheap, do not ignore the phishing shopping fraud trap.
