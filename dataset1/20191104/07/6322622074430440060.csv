（吉隆坡4日讯）Seacera Group Bhd的4名股东，为将于本月29日举行的第34届股东常年大会发出决议通知，要求委任6名新董事。
这4名股东是Ng Wai Yuan、拿汀石倩妮、Low Swee Foong和拿督陈维年，合共持有公司2.5%股权。
根据向大马交易所报备的通告，这6名董事是Rivzi Abdul Halim、Datin Ida Suzaini Abdullah、Marzuki Hussain、Tan Lee Chin、Ong Eng Taik和Ramnath R. Sundaram。
“所有提名的人士均已同意出任董事，并声明他们并无丧失委任为公司董事的资格。”
10月17日，声称共同持有至少10%股权的6名股东，即JS Portfolio私人有限公司、Mak Hon Leong、Ng、Ong、石倩妮及Low要求在12月3日召开股东特别大会（EGM），以委任6名新董事和罢黜9名现有董事。
该集团当时表示将寻求法律咨询，但之后没有消息。
过去几个月，Seacera的股东一直要求召开特大。今年6月，该公司试图撤销Ng和另两名股东Lim Seow Chin和Ooi Chieng Sim提出的特大申请。
这家瓷砖制造商近来成为外界关注的焦点，因为发生一系列董事纠纷、自4月拖欠贷款后列入PN17，以及未能向马交所提交偿付能力声明。
Seacera时任董事经理Zulkarnin Ariffin于5月底辞职，而一天前，高庭驳回他阻止公司单一最大股东陈维年召开特大的禁令申请。
也是金虎集团（Tiger Synergy Bhd）执行主席的陈维年，曾要求开特大委任新董事和罢免现有董事。
截至3时35分，Seacera扬3仙或10.53%，报31.5仙，市值为1亿5130万令吉。

KUALA LUMPUR (April 4): Four shareholders of Seacera Group Bhd will issue a resolution notice to the appointment of six new directors at the 34th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on the 29th of this month.
The four shareholders are Ng Wai Yuan, Datin Shi Qianni, Low Swee Foong and Datuk Chen Weinian, which together hold a 2.5% stake in the company.
According to a notice filed with the Bursa Malaysia, the six directors are Rivzi Abdul Halim, Datin Ida Suzaini Abdullah, Marzuki Hussain, Tan Lee Chin, Ong Eng Taik and Ramnath R. Sundaram.
