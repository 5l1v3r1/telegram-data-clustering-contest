Expect hits from the Fugees era, like Killing Me Softly With His Song, plus tracks from her titanic 1998 album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, including this absolute classic.



And this one:



The singer will be opening proceedings, with support coming British jazz and soul singer songwriter Bruno Major. More acts will be announced over the coming days, so stay close to timeoutdubai.com for the latest reveals.One of the best parts of winter is the ace weekend of live music that lands every February, tickets will be available on dubaijazzfest.com once all acts have been revealed on Wednesday November 6.Wed Feb 26, 2020.
