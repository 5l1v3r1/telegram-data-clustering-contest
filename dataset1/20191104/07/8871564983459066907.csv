WATCH: Motorcyclist confronts another on Jakarta road after getting cigarette ash in his eye
04 Nov 2019, 07:59 by Coconuts Jakarta
Motorcyclists in Jakarta are often exposed to toxic fumes and air pollution in general (the capital consistently ranks among the worst cities in the world in terms of air quality), yet many still think it’s perfectly acceptable to puff away on their cigarettes while driving. 
One obvious harm that could bring is that hot cigarette ash could endanger motorcyclists driving behind them. In a recent viral video taken on an unspecified road in Jakarta, a motorcyclist with a helmet cam says he got cigarette ash in his eye twice from a smoking motorcyclist who was driving ahead of him.



The video begins with the alleged cigarette ash victim trying to overtake the smoking motorcyclist. Eventually, they stop at an intersection and the alleged victim told the smoker that his cigarette ash hit him in the eye. He demanded the smoker to butt out immediately.
Instead of apologizing, the smoker just nods a couple of times and continues smoking. The alleged victim then pressures him to butt out, showing him his red eye from the cigarette ash, but, again, the smoker refuses to butt out, saying he was finishing up and that it shouldn’t be a problem because they weren’t moving.
The alleged victim then told the smoker’s passenger that she should’ve warned him, before telling the smoker, “What if others get cigarette ash in their eye? … If you don’t butt out after we’re moving I am going to smack you.” The smoker eventually puts out the cigarette as the traffic light turns green.
It’s not clear who the alleged victim in the video is, but, after it went viral, the police issued a timely reminder that smoking while driving a motorcycle falls under the category of actions that distract focus away from driving, which is a traffic violation punishable by three months’ imprisonment or an IDR750K (US$53) fine.
