NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 4 – Chief Justice David Maraga has broken his silence over frustrations from the Executive, which he blamed on under-funding, and failing to treat him with the dignity and respect he deserves.

“We have a huge backlog of cases which continue to pile because of lack of funds to even move judges around,” he said, “Some judges are not able to get fuel for their cars and we are having to ask them to get money from their pockets so that we can refund them.”
In Nyeri, Nakuru and Mombasa, the CJ said the Court of Appeal is not able to operate due to lack of funds.
“We should be given at least Sh5 billion every year for us to operate properly, or at least a reasonable amount,” he said.
And he also blamed the Executive for failing to treat him with dignity, citing state functions where he is never recognised.
Worse still, he said, as the country’s Chief Justice, he is never allowed to access the VIP lounge at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) yet junior officers than him are given access.
“Let the office of the CJ be treated with dignity,” he said.
