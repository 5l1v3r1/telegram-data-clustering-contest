      <p>Sunday's defeat to Getafe was Celta's fourth defeat in a row and left them 18th in the standings on nine points after 12 games, two behind Real Mallorca who occupy the last berth outside the drop zone.</p>
      <p>A former coach of Villareal, Getafe and Elche, Escriba took charge of Celta in March and helped them avoid relegation but his side have only managed to win two games this season, drawing three and losing seven.</p>
