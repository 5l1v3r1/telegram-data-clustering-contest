      <p><i>Spy Kids</i> star Daryl Sabara has been allegedly charged with two misdemeanours after he vandalised a parked car.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old actor was walking by a parked car near the UCLA campus in Los Angeles when he attacked it with his bare hands, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/03/daryl-sabara-vandalize-car-charged/">TMZ </a>reports.</p>
      <p>Sabara, who is married to Meghan Trainor, was reportedly charged with one count of vandalism and one count of tampering with a vehicle but his arraignment is set to take place later this month.</p>

      <p>The incident is thought to have taken place in March and was apparently captured on CCTV footage at a housing complex.</p>
      <p>Daryl is best known for playing the quick-thinking Juni Cortez in the <i>Spy Kids</i> franchise alongside Alexa Vega as his sister Carmen.</p>
      <p>He now largely specialises in voice-over work, playing several roles in Cartoon Network’s <i>Ben 10</i> and previously portraying the Rhino on<i> Ultimate Spider-Man</i>, which ran from 2013 to 2017.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Sabara also came to prominence when he featured in a<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/people-pretty-baffled-bizarre-super-horny-meghan-trainor-press-release-2449255"> bizarre press release</a> for Trainor’s EP ‘The Love Train’, which referred to the pair tying the knot in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Unless your phone’s been broken for a hot minute, you know that Meghan just got married to the ginger from Spy Kids, and trust when we say, girl is feeling the love,” it stated.</p>
