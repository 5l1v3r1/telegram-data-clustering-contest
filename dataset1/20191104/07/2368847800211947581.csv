04 Nov 2019, 07:33

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】「艾蜜莉」（Amelia）暴風雨侵襲法國南部，海邊掀起巨浪，狂風將樹木連根拔起，電纜線被拉扯鬆弛，造成14萬人無電可用。這場風災尚未有相關的死亡案例，但南部城市尼斯（Nice）南區發生山崩，一名七旬女性被通報失蹤，緊急救援人員正試圖找到她。
3日早上，「艾蜜莉」在大西洋沿岸部分地區的風速每小時超過160公里，法國101個省之中，有14個列為高度警戒區。據法國氣象局（Meteo France）表示，在吉倫特省（Gironde）和朗德省（Landes）測到時速達163公里的強風，在波爾多也記錄到時速121公里的風。

電力供應商Enedis表示，正夜以繼日為已經數小時無電可用的14萬名客戶修復電力。
風災影響最劇烈的法國西南部，有6人受輕傷，主要是樹枝掉落造成。法國國家鐵路公司（SNCF）表示，由於約50棵樹倒在軌道上，西南地區有數列火車班次取消或延誤。
在朗德省，有47人自露營地疏散，還有一座賭場屋頂倒塌。
東南部也因大雨使得一個流浪族群營地不得不疏散。另約30名汽車駕駛因受困於洪水需要救援，數間商店和住家的地下室也淹水。
受惡劣天氣影響，高速公路A7及A21南部路段暫時封閉。3日早上，從科西嘉島阿雅丘（Ajaccio）飛往法國的兩個班次取消，其他班次則改道前往科西嘉島的巴斯提亞（Bastia）降落。

Power supplier Enedis said it is repairing electricity for the 140,000 customers who have been available for hours without electricity.
Six people were slightly injured in the southwestern part of France, which was most affected by the typhoon, mainly due to the fall of branches. The French National Railways (SNCF) said that due to the fact that about 50 trees were on the track, several trains were cancelled or delayed in the southwest.
In Landes, 47 people were evacuated from the campsite and a casino roof collapsed.
In the southeast, a wandering camp had to be evacuated due to heavy rain. About 30 other car drivers were rescued due to flooding, and several shops and home basements were flooded.
Affected by bad weather, the southern section of expressway A7 and A21 was temporarily closed. On the morning of the 3rd, two flights from Ajaccio, Corsica, to France were cancelled, and the other shifts were diverted to Bastia in Corsica.
