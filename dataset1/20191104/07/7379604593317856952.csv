Will Tess ever learn any new words? Will Claudia ever cut her fringe? We hope not. See you next week for more ballroom bantzzz. KEEP READING…. WE MEAN…. DANCING. Cha-cha-cheerio for now.
vgarofalides11 hours agoNovember 3, 2019SAFF-OCATING? Ah. Young people. Happy and carefree. Their time will come when they can't run without a sports bra and make debilitating noises when they crouch down. Enjoy it for now, Saff and Aj. Also, well done.

Looking forward to a ‘dizzy’ week- Viennese waltz.” Not quite sure what Claudia Winkle's 'area' is though… Is it a VIP area?
