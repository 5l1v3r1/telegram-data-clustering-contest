昨（3日）下午1點40分左右，知名風景區南投奧萬大森林遊樂區，傳出1名2歲幼兒從奧萬大吊橋橋面與鐵絲網的隙縫中墜入河床，園區工作人員雖緊急通報救難人員，但尋獲男童時，已經沒有呼吸心跳，雖經CPR急救，但送一仍回天乏術；林務局強調，這座橋今年10月才完成委外安全檢查，事故發生原因仍待警方調查釐清。
南投縣消防局119勤務中心是在昨天下午1點46分接獲報案，指有個2歲大的男童，不慎從仁愛鄉奧萬大森林遊樂區的吊橋墜入7、80公尺深的河床。勤務中心立刻派遣仁愛分隊、埔里分隊；共4車10人前往搜救。
救難隊人員很快在在溪床找到男童，但是他已經沒有心跳、呼吸，雖然救難人員緊急施以CPR，並送往台中榮總埔里分院，但還是回天乏術。
林務局指出，根據警方初步調查，男童是在橋面與鐵絲網間的縫隙掉落、墜橋。但林務局指出，吊橋兩側均有設置密集的圍網，別說大人，就算是小孩，也很難從兩側的圍牆跨過，在橋上正常行走應是安全無虞，為何會發生意外？林務局人員也感到很納悶。
林務局人員強調，奧萬大吊橋全長180公尺，高約90公尺，2009年7月啟用，至今約10年。吊橋為吊床式設計，兩側均有高140公分的安全護網，比規定安全高度110公分高出30公分，每月都會由巡視人員檢視設施情況，10月份才委外完成安全檢查。
