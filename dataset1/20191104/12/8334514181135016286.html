      <p>Prosecutors at Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) had accused Sofyan Basir of accepting the “promise of a bribe” related to a construction contract for a power plant in Riau province on the island of Sumatra.</p>
      <p>“We hereby declare the defendant not guilty of unlawful acts as per the first and second indictments,” head judge Hariono, who goes by one name, told the Indonesia corruption court.</p>
      <p>Basir was named a suspect in April after police raided his residence in mid-2018.</p>
      <p>Two other suspects were found guilty after a sting operation in 2018. Prosecutors had also suggested a five-year prison sentence and a 200 million rupiah ($14,000) fine for Basir.</p>
      <p>“I’m grateful God gave the best to me today,” Basir told reporters in a broadcast on television.</p>
      <p>Soesilo Aribowo, Basir’s lawyer, told Metro TV his client’srole as a facilitator in the case was never proven.</p>
      <p>The not-guilty verdict was a rare court defeat for the KPK. Laode M. Syarif, deputy head of the commission, said it was deciding whether to file an appeal.</p>
      <p>PLN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The case was a continuation of high-profile graft investigations under President Joko Widodo, who has sought to clean up the image of Indonesia’s energy sector after a series of scandals implicating government officials.</p>
      <p>(The story corrects spelling of lawyer in 7th paragraph to Soesilo Aribowo, not Susilo Ariwibowo)</p>
