      <p>Biohackers believe that we should be using all the technology available to make our bodies and minds work the best they can in everyday life. In <a href="https://new.biohackersummit.com/">Helsinki</a> over the weekend they held a conference.</p>
      <p>Most people who have heard of Biohacking think of electronic chips inserted under the skin - cyborg stuff. But here they're promoting a wearable ring to measure the body.</p>
      <p>Ramsey Morgan, a Biohacker from Seattle, tested out <a href="https://cellgym.eu/">a machine</a> which steadily takes the body up to air conditions you'd expect at high altitude.=</p>
      <p>"I feel amazing - mentally and cognitively - like a stoic. I wake up every morning feeling like the Hulk." he says.</p>
      <p>The movement is trying to make itself more mainstream and accessible.</p>
      <p>And while most of us probably don't get enough sleep, the Biohackers say vibration technology can help.</p>
      <p>It is not all so technical - getting in a sauna and a 4 degree Celsius bath is enough for some Biohackers.</p>
      <p>But with the ever-evolving technological world we live in - these guys think they're the future.</p>
