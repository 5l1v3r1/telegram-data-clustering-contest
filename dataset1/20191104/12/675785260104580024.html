      <h2>Power season 6 continues to enthrall viewers - but when does a new episode arrive on Netflix UK?</h2>

        <b>Spoiler warning for Power season 6 episode 10</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest season of Ghost's antics has not let up.</p>
      <p>Power season 6 has seen some intense drama go down, but the midseason finale - entitled No one Can Stop Me - saw one of the enemies of James St. Patrick aka Ghost ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/omari-hardwick">Omari Hardwick</a> ) gun down the gangster and cause him to fall from a balcony in his nightclub after being shot.</p>
      <p>But who was responsible for pulling the trigger?</p>
      <p>Additionally, will Ghost survive his wounds and fall?</p>
      <p>Most importantly, however, when can we expect the next episode of Power season 6 on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> ?</p>

      <p>Power season 6 is airing in two parts, with episode 10 proving to be the midseason finale before the show takes a break until 2020.</p>
      <p>It is widely expected - but not confirmed - that Power season 6 episode 11 will air on Starz in the US on <b>January 5, 2020.</b></p>
      <p>If this is true, then UK fans can expect the episode to be available on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> on <b>January 6, 2020.</b></p>
      <p>However, keep in mind, this date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Regardless, we have quite a wait on our hands for new episodes, so perhaps you should just watch the first part of season 6 all over again!</p>
      <p>It also gives us time to look for more clues to as to who shot Ghost.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Power season 6 is shown on Netflix in the UK.</b>
