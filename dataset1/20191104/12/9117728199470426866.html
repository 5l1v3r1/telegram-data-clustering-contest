      <h1>Perez on "tremendous" US Grand Prix</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> finished tenth at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">US Grand Prix</a>, a result he described as <i>"tremendous"</i> after he rose through the field having been given a pitlane start.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perez was forced to start from the pitlane after he missed the weighbridge after the second practice session of the weekend on Friday. However, this didn't deter the Mexican as he used an aggressive one-stop strategy to finish in the points.</p>
      <p>Despite a late coming together with Daniil Kvyat which dropped him outside the points temporarily, Perez was very satisfied with his race at the Circuit of the Americas.</p>
      <p><i>“We had a tremendous race today and we managed to recover well as a team,"</i> Perez said on the <a href="https://www.racingpointf1.com/news/2019-united-states-grand-prix-sunday-report-sportpesa-racing-point-f1-team">Racing Point website</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We used a very aggressive one-stop strategy and had good pace all afternoon. On the final lap, Kvyat crashed into me and damaged my front wing, but he was penalised and we took back the tenth place.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"One point means we move up to sixth place in the Constructors’ Championship, which is important with two races to go. It’s only a point today, but every point will count at the end of the season.”</i>
      </p>
