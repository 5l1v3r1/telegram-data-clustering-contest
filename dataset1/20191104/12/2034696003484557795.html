        <b>What a collaboration</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/eddie-vedder">Eddie Vedder</a> and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/red-hot-chili-peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> teamed up over the weekend to deliver their own take on <a href="http://nme.com/artists/prince">Prince</a>‘s ‘Purple Rain’ and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jimi-hendrix">Jimi Hendrix’s</a> ‘All Along The Watchtower’.</p>
      <p>The performance came during the encore of an annual fundraising concert for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music – the non profit music school founded by RHCP bassist Flea almost twenty years ago.</p>
      <p>While the Chilis also performed hits like ‘Soul to Squeeze’, ‘Suck My Kiss’ and ‘By the Way,’ Vedder performed a solo set of assorted Pearl Jam favorites.</p>

      <p>For Vedder, it marked his latest high-profile duet in as many months, having teamed <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-eddie-vedder-join-strokes-perform-juicebox-hard-explain-2552247">up with The Strokes in September </a> for an epic cover of Pearl Jam’s ‘Hard To Imagine’, before topping it off with their own take on The Strokes’ very own ‘Juicebox’.</p>
      <p>The Chili Peppers, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-red-hot-chili-peppers-cover-the-cars-just-what-i-needed-in-tribute-to-ric-ocasek-2550863">paid tribute to the late Ric Ocasek by covering The Cars.</a></p>
      <p>As they performed at Singapore’s Marina Bay on Sunday night, the ‘Californication’ rockers delivered their own take on ‘Just What I Needed’.</p>
      <p>This week also sees the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/red-hot-chilli-peppers-flea-memoir-more-details-revealed-2537757">release of Flea’s debut memoir, ‘Acid for the Children’.</a></p>
