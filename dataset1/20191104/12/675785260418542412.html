      <h1>Ed Woodward 'wanted to sign £200million duo' - but Jose Mourinho snubbed plan</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward used to be involved in the club's recruitment strategy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:29:52+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Ed Woodward reportedly wanted Manchester United to land Marco Verratti and Raphael Varane - but then boss Jose Mourinho ruled the signings out as unattainable.</p>
      <p>Woodward used to be heavily involved in the Red Devils' recruitment strategy and earmarked the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> defender as dream signings.</p>
      <p>He believed the duo would help rebuild United's spine ahead of the 2018/19 season, even though they would have cost around £100million each, and spoke to Mourinho about the prospect of signing the duo.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho didn't even entertain the idea due to how difficult it would have been to land either player, according to the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-news-today-17194687">Manchester Evening News.</a></p>

      <p>Instead of trying - and likely failing - Mourinho turned his attention to Shakhtar Donetsk's Brazilian midfielder Fred, who he landed for £52million.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese missed out on signing a centre-back that summer despite being linked with everyone from Kalidou Koulibaly to Toby Alderweireld.</p>

      <p>He did however sign Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant, in addition to Fred.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sacked midway through that season and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was initially given the job on a temporary basis.</p>

      <p>After making an impressive start at Old Trafford, particularly in Europe, Solskjaer was given the job permanently.</p>
      <p>But things haven't exactly gone to plan for the Norwegian or United this season, with the Red Devils just five points off the relegation places after 11 games played.</p>
