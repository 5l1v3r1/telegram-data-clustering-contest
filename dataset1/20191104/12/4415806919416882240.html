      <p>The inquest into the death of Jastine Valdez has been told a witness heard a woman screaming from the boot of a car on the day she disappeared.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old student was abducted in Enniskerry, Co Wicklow in broad daylight on May 19, 2018.</p>
      <p>Her body was discovered two days later in Rathmichael, south Dublin.</p>
      <p>Susan Forsyth told the inquest in a statement that she was driving past Powerscourt Estate on May 19 at around 6.15pm when she noticed a car parked on the road.</p>
      <p>As she passed she said she heard screaming and noticed an Asian woman sitting in the boot looking out towards her.</p>
      <p>She heard a slapping sound and a male voice shouting angrily and she pulled in and phoned 999 as the car sped away.</p>
      <p>Another witness, Gareth Thompson, told the inquest that on his way home from Bray that evening, a black Nissan Qashqai pulled out in front of him.</p>
      <p>He noticed what he thought was a little girl waving out the back of the vehicle at him, looking concerned.</p>
      <p>A statement was read from Joseph Squire who was dating Miss Valdez, stating she was the most innocent person "I ever met and will ever meet".</p>
      <p>A statement from Miss Valdez's mother Tess, who was present at the hearing, said Jastine was happy, healthy, and that going missing was very out of character for her.</p>
      <p>A previous inquest hearing heard Miss Valdez died of asphyxia.</p>
