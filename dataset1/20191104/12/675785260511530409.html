      <p>A controversial Channel 4 documentary that was pulled from the schedule in the wake of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/essex-lorry-deaths">tragic deaths of 39 migrants</a> is set to air one week on.</p>
      <p>Smuggled will preview on the channel tonight at 9pm.</p>
      <p>The series follows a group of eight British citizens - without their passports - as they try to evade border security and make it into the UK undetected.</p>
      <p>It was originally scheduled to air last Monday, but was pulled following the terrible discovery of 39 bodies in the back of a lorry in Essex.</p>
      <p>A Channel 4 spokeswoman said at the time: "In light of the tragic events today we have postponed the transmission of the series."</p>

      <p>He added: "This evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims."</p>
