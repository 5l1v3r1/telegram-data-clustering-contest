      <h2>Terminator Dark Fate was well-received by critics but audiences don't seem to be flocking to see it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:43:30+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The future may not be written in stone but it's not looking good either.</p>
      <p>Terminator Dark Fate has significantly under-performed at the box office, both in the US and in international territories.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/terminator-dark-fate-puts-franchise-ice-faces-120m-loss-1251926">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film bombed at the US box office on its opening weekend, bringing in only $29 million, which is significantly behind what was expected.</p>
      <p>Overseas, the sequel has not performed as well either, grossing only $94.6 million to date.</p>
      <p>This takes the film's global box office to $123 million, which means that the partner studios of Skydance Media, Paramount Pictures, and 20th Century Fox all face a $120 million-plus loss.</p>
      <p>It is also worth noting that the Fox film studio is now owned by Disney.</p>
      <p>The news doesn't bode well for potential follow-ups to Dark Fate, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/terminator-dark-fate-ending-explained-20730402">ending of which left open enough room for potential sequels.</a></p>

      <p>Dark Fate was produced by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-cameron">James Cameron</a> as a sequel to the first two Terminator films that he directed, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/linda-hamilton">Linda Hamilton</a> returning to her iconic role of Sarah Connor opposite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> as as the Terminator.</p>
      <p>The film saw them forced to team up - despite some serious grievances - to protect a Mexican woman named Dani Ramo (Natalia Reyes), who is targeted by the machines from the future but protected by a mysterious human saviour, Grace (Mackenzie Davis).</p>
      <p>However, it looks like this may be it for the franchise.</p>
      <p>Has it been terminated?</p>
