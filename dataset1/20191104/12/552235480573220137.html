      <h2>Officers swooped on the East Dunbartonshire MP's Westminster office at around 10am today.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:20:27+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, Dan Bloom, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>Police have swooped on the office of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrat-party">Liberal Democrats'</a> leader Jo Swinson after a suspicious package was found.</p>
      <p>Officers rushed to the parliamentary office of the East Dunbartonshire MP at around 10am on Monday, November 4.</p>
      <p>Sources told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-police-investigate-suspicious-package-20807940">Mirror</a> that the office and staff at her Westminster office were quarantined while police continued to carry out checks.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the Lib Dem leader was not in the building at the time of the discovery.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Met Police said: “ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> were called at approximately 09:51hrs on Monday, 4 November to reports of a suspicious package delivered to Portcullis House, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/uk-government">Westminster</a> .</p>
      <p>"Officers are in attendance and the contents of the package are being assessed.</p>
      <p>"No reports of any illness or injuries. The premises have not been evacuated. Enquiries continue.”</p>
      <p>Packages delivered to Parliament are security screened and scares over suspicious parcels are not uncommon.</p>
      <p>A House of Commons spokeswoman confirmed: "We are aware of an incident on the Parliamentary Estate which is being managed by the police."</p>
