      <p>Now that we've entered November, you can officially pack away the Halloween decorations and prepare for the holidays. Black Friday, which falls on 29 November this year, is a great opportunity to save on Christmas presents, though excellent deals are already starting to roll in. Right now, Amazon is bundling a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W73PTJB?ascsubtag=06-3777146-11-0000000">free Echo Dot with a 4-pack bundle of the latest Tile Mate Bluetooth trackers</a>.</p>
      <p>Though this isn't specifically a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday deal</a>, it's still a fantastic discount. A single <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777146-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fdigital-home%2Ffree-amazon-echo-dot-tile-mate-deal-3777146%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-gb%2Fstore%2Ftiles%2Fmate">Tile Mate costs £19.99</a>, while the 4-pack costs £79.96, regularly. Tile is currently running a promotion that reduces quad-squad pack of Tile Mates to £59.99, which is the price Amazon has mirrored – except Amazon's deal also gets you the Echo Dot for free (it's separately worth £49.99). <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07W73PTJB?ascsubtag=06-3777146-11-0000000">Head to Amazon now to see this Tile Mate and Echo Dot bundle deal</a>.</p>
      <p>Don't forget you can also get <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Charcoal/dp/B07PJV3JPR?ascsubtag=06-3777146-11-0000000">£15 off the Echo Dot right now</a> if you're just after the smart speaker alone.

      <p>If you're not entirely sure, the Tile Mate is a small tag with a 200-foot Bluetooth range that helps you locate everyday things prone to getting lost – like your phone, keys, wallet or pet even. It operates with a connected app, which you can use to ring the Tile tag.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if you're looking for your phone, you can press a button on the Tile tracker to make your phone ring even when its on silent. The Tile Mate promises a one-year battery life. We've <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/accessories/tile-pro-2018-3684668/">reviewed the Tile Pro (2018)</a> and loved it, though we only wished it was waterproof. It is splash-proof, however.</p>
