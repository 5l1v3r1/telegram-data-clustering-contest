In South Africa pressure is not having a job. It is one of your friends being murdered. Rugby shouldn't be something that creates pressure.Rassie Erasmus, South Africa coach












The World Cup is like a rollercoaster ... You get down the first slope and you are not sure if you are going to throw up or hang on.Eddie Jones, England coach









We need to bring chaos into their organisation.Vasily Artemyev, Russia, before the opening match against Japan









They won it, I don't think we lost it.Rassie Erasmus, after defeat to New Zealand



Our game is about intimidation. Some people might not want to hear that, but that's a fact.Steve Hansen, New Zealand coach









I don't know where it comes from. It's inside. It's in there. Today, we had to go there to fetch it, and it came.Juan Manuel Gaminara, Uruguay captain, after defeating Fiji









Japan did not exceed my expectations. They met them.Joe Schmidt, Ireland coach, after defeat to Japan









I was behind the last man and I started laughing because the forwards were driving so well I couldn't yell.Faf de Klerk, South Africa scrum-half









If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled.Sergio Parisse, Italy
If you play it later, then that’s when we are finished for Christmas, you’d have Santa Claus giving out the World Cup.Steve Hansen






The things that happen in this tournament don't happen in other sports. You've got the Canadian blokes cleaning up (after Typhoon Hagibis).Eddie Jones












I want to set a good example and show what being a man is. Being a man isn't losing your rag and your emotions. It's about being calm.Kyle Sinckler, England prop



I think the better team lost today.Warren Gatland, Wales coach, after the quarter-final win over France
They came out with a hiss and a roar, gave us a punch to the nose from the get-go.George Bridge, New Zealand, after the semi-final defeat by England















We'll be kicking stones for four years. And it's hard to kick stones for four years.Eddie Jones






I never dreamed of a day like this at all. When I was a kid all I was thinking about was getting my next meal.Siya Kolisi, South Africa captain
