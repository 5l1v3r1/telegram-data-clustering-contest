      <p><b>THE MORE THE MERRIER:</b> <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/selfridges/">Selfridges</a> envisions an alternative Christmas in its latest future-facing campaign film for the festive season. The film is an extension of the retailer’s Christmas windows, which were unveiled in October, under the theme “Future Fantasy: A Christmas for Modern Time,” which is also the title of the short film.</p>
      <p>The film features actress Noomi Rapace and R&amp;B singer Miguel, who play cohosts at a dinner party. Guests include Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wiley, fashion publisher Jefferson Hack, <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/dior/">Dior</a> Men creative director Kim Jones and musician Little Simz, who narrates the story in an ad-lib, spoken-word voiceover.</p>
      <p>Directed by Nabil Elderkin, the film moves between various stylized scenes, from a merry dinner feast to a rave-like house party complete with strobing lights and guests dressed to the nines in Gucci, Balenciaga and Valentino, to present the perennial Christmas tale of togetherness.</p>

      <p>To go with the film, Selfridges has also commissioned a project by Daniel Arsham for its latest Corner Shop takeover, which sees a display of the artist’s artworks and products displayed in a house-like set. The house’s set is also featured throughout the film.</p>
      <p>“Through ‘Future Fantasy,’ we want to tell a traditional story in a nontraditional, future-facing way,” said Sebastian Manes, executive buying and merchandising director of Selfridges.</p>
      <p>“We are interested in reaching our customers via extraordinary physical and digital experiences and environments and across different creative mediums. I hope this story of an alternative family coming together at Christmas time engages and entertains both our current — and future — Selfridges customers in an unexpected way,” Manes added.</p>
      <p>In October, Selfridges was one of the first department stores to unveil its in-store display and windows for the Christmas season featuring reimagined scenes of well-known fairy tales and Santa Claus dressed in a metallic silver suit.</p>
      <p>Last year’s theme, “Selfridges Rocks Christmas,” presented a focus on in-store entertainment through Christmas cabarets and pop-up choirs and the use of decorations inspired by famous rock ’n’ roll acts such as the Rolling Stones.</p>
