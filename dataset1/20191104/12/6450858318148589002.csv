Tile Mate deal includes free Amazon Echo Dot before Black Friday
You can pick up a free Amazon Echo Dot when you get this four-pack Tile Mate bundle deal ahead of Black Friday.

Now that we've entered November, you can officially pack away the Halloween decorations and prepare for the holidays. Black Friday, which falls on 29 November this year, is a great opportunity to save on Christmas presents, though excellent deals are already starting to roll in. Right now, Amazon is bundling a free Echo Dot with a 4-pack bundle of the latest Tile Mate Bluetooth trackers.
Though this isn't specifically a Black Friday deal, it's still a fantastic discount. A single Tile Mate costs £19.99, while the 4-pack costs £79.96, regularly. Tile is currently running a promotion that reduces quad-squad pack of Tile Mates to £59.99, which is the price Amazon has mirrored – except Amazon's deal also gets you the Echo Dot for free (it's separately worth £49.99). Head to Amazon now to see this Tile Mate and Echo Dot bundle deal.
Don't forget you can also get £15 off the Echo Dot right now if you're just after the smart speaker alone. Use the comparison tool below to see Echo Dot prices across major retailers:
If you're not entirely sure, the Tile Mate is a small tag with a 200-foot Bluetooth range that helps you locate everyday things prone to getting lost – like your phone, keys, wallet or pet even. It operates with a connected app, which you can use to ring the Tile tag.
Conversely, if you're looking for your phone, you can press a button on the Tile tracker to make your phone ring even when its on silent. The Tile Mate promises a one-year battery life. We've reviewed the Tile Pro (2018) and loved it, though we only wished it was waterproof. It is splash-proof, however.
Head to Tile to pick up the Tile Mate on its own, or head to Amazon to pick it up with a free Echo Dot.
