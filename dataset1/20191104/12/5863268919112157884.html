      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led federal government has decided to bring the matter of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal’s Azadi March to the parliament for its political solution as the National Assembly session has been summoned on November 7 at 04:00 PM, Dunya News reported on Monday.</p>
