      <p>The driver exited the car and allegedly lunged at Sierra and assaulted him in the right travel lane. Sierra responded and placed him in custody.</p>
      <p>Other troopers, Lexington firefighters and EMS assisted.</p>
      <p>An investigation revealed that when Sierra arrived, the 30-year-old suspect, of Lowell, was committing domestic assault against the two women passengers: a 29-year-old friend of Woburn and a 57-year-old relative from Burlington.</p>
      <p>The older woman was taken to Lahey Hospital to be evaluated, while the younger woman declined medical attention. She was arrested for an outstanding warrant and taken to Concord State Police.</p>

      <p>1. Assault and battery with a dangerous weapon<br/>2. Assault and battery on a police officer<br/>3. Domestic assault and battery<br/>4. Operating under the influence of drugs <br/>5. Disorderly conduct. </p>
