        <b>Rescuers in the French city of Nice, ravaged by a storm at the weekend, said Monday they have found the body of a 71-year-old woman who had gone missing following of heavy rains the previous day.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The woman’s husband reported her missing after she was swept away in a landslide as she tended to her garden in a north-western neighbourhood of the Mediterranean coastal city.</p>
      <p>“The body of the victim was found after a nearly 24-hour search by firefighters,” said Eric Brocardi, spokesperson of rescue group SDIS in the Alpes-Maritimes department.</p>
      <p>Some 60 rescuers worked through the night to find the woman, who became caught in the mudflow provoked by the <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20191102-france-atlantic-coast-storm-amelie-alert-extreme-weather">heavy rains</a> that hit the Alpes-Maritimes department during the night between Saturday and Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rescuers said the embankments remained unstable, and sixteen residents of the same neighbourhood have been evacuated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>30,000 homes without electricity</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Alpes-Maritimes department was placed under orange alert for rains, storms and floods as <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20191103-storm-amelie-pummels-frances-atlantic-coast-extreme-winds-rain-mediterranean">storm Amélie moved inland</a> after first hitting the Atlantic coast.</p>
      <p>Gusts of more than 160 kilometres per hour forces road closures and train delays as uprooted trees blocked roads and railroads in the southwest.</p>
      <p>Energy distributor Enedis told AFP agency 30,000 households across the southwest remained without power on Monday morning, down from 140,000 on Sunday.</p>
