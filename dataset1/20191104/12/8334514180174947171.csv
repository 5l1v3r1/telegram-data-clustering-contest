Taylor Swift won “Best U.S. Act” and “Best Video” and Eilish was awarded “Best Song” and “Best New” in a show that celebrated “Year of the Woman” with performances from acts including Dua Lipa, Halsey and Rosalia.
“We are about that girl power always, I think that’s what’s happening right now,” host Becky G said on the red carpet.
Liam Gallagher closed the show with his new single “Once” and a singalong rendition of Oasis anthem “Wonderwall”, complete with string instruments and band.
“I want to thank MTV for recognizing my brilliance,” Gallagher said when receiving the award.
Korean superstars BTS, who have led the wave of K-pop music sweeping the global scene, won “Best Live” and “Biggest Fans”.
NCT 127 became the first ever K-pop group to perform on stage at the EMAs.
“Well, it makes us very nervous to know that we are the first K-pop group to be here but that much more we think it’s important,” said band member Johnny. “We want to show our fans in Europe our great performance.”
The show at Seville’s FIBES Conference and Exhibition centre also saw the first global performance of “Como No”, the reggaeton hit by Akon and Becky G. She later performed a medley of her hits including “24/7”, “Sin Pijama” and “Mayores”.
Some of the biggest screams on the red carpet were for a surprise guest, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who arrived with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.
American rockers Green Day played for thousands of fans in Seville’s iconic Plaza de Espana, performing their new single “Father of All” and fan favorite “Basket Case”.
Other notable performances included Halsey, who won “Best Pop”, lighting up the stage for an intimate performance of “Graveyard” during which she set fire to a carousel horse.
Local girl and international sensation Rosalia gave a powerful performance of “Di Mi Nombre” backed by 52 dancers against a pyramid of red chairs. She won “Best Collaboration” along with J Balvin for their hit “Con Altura ft. El Guincho”.
