      <h1>[Updated]First details of the camera of the Samsung Galaxy S11 leaked online</h1>

      <p>The camera quality in both the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series is no longer the best available in the market — the latest iPhone models and Pixel 4 series of smartphones dethroned Samsung’s Note10 and S10 series smartphones as the best camera smartphones you can buy right now.</p>
      <p>Samsung is very much aware of the fierce competition and is trying to bring a better camera and it appears that the upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone is what Samsung will be relying heavily upon to re-claim its camera supremacy.</p>
      <p>According to reliable leaker <i>Ice Universe</i>, there is a high degree of probability that the Galaxy S11 will use <s>the 108MP Samsung ISOCELL Bright (S5KHMX) image sensor</s>. a new 108MP Samsung image sensor. <s>However, the Galaxy S11 won’t be the first smartphone to have such a huge camera sensor, the reason being the fact that</s> The new image sensor would be different from what you’ll find in <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-partners-with-xiaomi-for-industrys-first-108mp-image-sensor-for-smartphones/">Xiaomi’s Mi Note 10 flagship smartphone</a>, which is all set to be launched tomorrow. The real challenge for Samsung will be the optimization of the camera and for that, a lot of effort needs to be put in making the camera software work well.</p>

      <p>That said, key differences between the existing 108MP and the new 108MP Samsung image sensor is still unknown.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the much-rumored Exynos 9830 could power Samsung’s upcoming flagship as it appears to be the successor to the Exynos 9820, the processor that powers the Galaxy S10 smartphones.</p>
      <p>Galaxy S11 is expected to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-galaxy-s11-leak-reveals-surprising-details-about-the-display/">feature a display with a weird 20:9 aspect ratio</a>, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. This will make the display look a lot like the one you find on the Galaxy A70 and Galaxy A80 as both A70 and A80 have a similar aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 is expected to be Samsung’s first flagship smartphone of the year 2020 and as usual, the expectation is also quite high.</p>
