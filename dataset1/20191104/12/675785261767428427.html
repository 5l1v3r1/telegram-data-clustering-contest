      <h1>Inside Declan Donnelly's huge family as new documentary uncovers cousins in America</h1>
      <h2>The Geordie presenter learnt about his Irish roots and discovered he has family in America - here is all you need to know</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:11:04+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> was left stunned after learning he had more than a dozen cousins he never knew existed in America.</p>
      <p>The telly star and his partner Ant McPartlin headed off to Ireland and the US in a brand new documentary to discover their family history in Ant &amp; Dec’s DNA Journey.</p>
      <p>Their new show is set to air this month - but for now we take a deeper look into Dec's family history.</p>
      <p>The Geordie star has Northern Irish roots. His parents Anne and Alphonsus lived in Desertmartin, Co. Derry before moving to Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1950s.</p>
      <p>In 2011 Dec's dad Alphonsus died from lung cancer at 78-years-old which left the star heartbroken.</p>
      <p>Dec revealed he was by his dad's side at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle at the time.</p>

      <p>During the early days of Dec's career, his dad was a towering strength.</p>
      <p>Dec, 44, married Ali Astall, 40, an Australian talent manager, in August 2015.</p>
      <p>The pair had been in a relationship for over a year before they tied the knot and the ceremony was conducted by his brother, Father Dermott Donnelly, who is a Catholic priest, with Ant as his best man.</p>

      <p>In 2018, the happy couple welcomed their first child, daughter Isla Elizabeth Anne into their lives.</p>
      <p>Dec is one of seven children, and was raised on Newcastle's Cruddas Park estate with three brothers - Martin, Eamonn and Dermott - and three sisters - Camelia, Patricia and Moira.</p>
      <p>Back in April, a rare photo of Dec pictured with his sister Moira was shared on social media, as she celebrated her 50th birthday back in Ponteland, Newcastle.</p>

      <p>The star took time out from his busy TV career to spend time with family and friends back home.</p>
      <p>But the telly favourite recently discovered he has affluent cousins living out in America.</p>
      <p>He admitted he thought he knew a fair bit about where he came from, but in fact it turned out he was wrong.</p>
      <p>Declan was left overwhelmed when he met his cousin Meg and her husband Greg.</p>

      <p>The couple provided transportation to their impressive home via one of their fleet of helicopters and as the I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here hosts arrived, they were greeted by a gigantic banner laid out on their lawn, welcoming "cousin Dec".</p>
      <p>Meg said: "My dad passed aged 63 (years old) and all his brothers passed as well.</p>
      <p>"So, I didn't really get to know much about him - it's nice to finally have a little bit of my dad back.</p>

      <p>"It's been kind of cool, especially for our kids."</p>
      <p>Dec replied: "I'm similar, I lost my dad in 2011 and you realise it's gone forever."</p>
      <p>Meg then explained, "This is what we've found out so far, we have the same great, great grandparents."</p>

      <p>Dec added: "That's incredible, that would be our common ancestor."</p>
      <p>He was then introduced to more than a dozen new cousins, and confessed he was really emotional.</p>
      <p>Dec gushed: "Oh wow, this is amazing. I’m really emotional. Oh my goodness. Nice to meet you all…This is quite overwhelming!"</p>

      <p>One of his cousins was called Tom, and he was a firefighter in New York and on duty during 9/11.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity presenter said his "mind is blown" from meeting his new family.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his whole experience, Dec said: "A huge part of this was to find out my heritage, especially on my dad's side.</p>

      <p>"I always thought I knew a fair bit about where I came from but it turns out I was wrong!</p>
      <p>"Whilst it was incredible to find out about the past, what was hugely overwhelming was to meet relatives neither of us knew we had. It was a truly amazing experience."</p>
