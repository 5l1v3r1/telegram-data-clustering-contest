A controversial Channel 4 documentary that was pulled from the schedule in the wake of the tragic deaths of 39 migrants is set to air one week on.
Smuggled will preview on the channel tonight at 9pm.
The series follows a group of eight British citizens - without their passports - as they try to evade border security and make it into the UK undetected.
It was originally scheduled to air last Monday, but was pulled following the terrible discovery of 39 bodies in the back of a lorry in Essex.
A Channel 4 spokeswoman said at the time: ""In light of the tragic events today we have postponed the transmission of the series.""
