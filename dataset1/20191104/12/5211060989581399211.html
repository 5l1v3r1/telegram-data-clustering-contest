      <p>TORONTO - New restrictions on the use of cellphones in classrooms across Ontario go into effect today.</p>
      <p>The directive says students can only use personal mobile devices during instructional time if it's for educational purposes, for health or medical purposes, or for special needs.</p>
      <p>Some schools already have similar policies, but the directive sets a provincial standard.</p>
      <p>Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government conducted education consultations last year, and respondents overwhelmingly favoured some sort of restriction on phones in class.</p>
      <p>The Toronto District School Board used to have a cellphone ban, but reversed it after four years to let teachers dictate what works best for their classrooms.</p>
      <p>A 2015 London School of Economics and Political Science paper found that "student performance in high-stakes exams significantly increases" with a ban on mobile phones.</p>
