      <p>Arc System Works has dropped its latest character trailer for <i>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle's</i> Version 2.0 update, which is coming later this month to the crossover anime fighter.<br/><br/>The irrepressible Elizabeth is the assistant of the mysterious Velvet Room in Atlus' RPG <i>Persona 3.</i> Typified by her happy-go-lucky, somewhat naive, and regularly goofy personality, Elizabeth is, in reality, a tireless worker and dedicated to the room and its master, Igor. Elizabeth originally took to the ring in <i>Persona 4 Arena</i>, where she fought with an adaptive style based on the moveset of multiple other characters.</p>
