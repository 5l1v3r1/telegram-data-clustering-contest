      <p>Samson Ayeni and Omolara Ogundipe recently tied the knot at The Word Bible Church, Ketu, Lagos.</p>
      <p>They also held a colourful engagement ceremony at Owutu-Isawo road, Agric bus stop, Ikorodu Lagos.</p>
      <p>The bride, 29, works as a Bank Teller at an Access Bank branch in Lekki, Lagos. She graduated from the Polytechnic Ilaro, Ogun State and received an accounting degree.</p>
      <p>She is the daughter of Titilayo Ogundipe and Abolaji Ogundipe of Ogun State.</p>

      <p>The groom told PREMIUM TIMES that his bride possessed all the qualities he required in a lady.<br/>”She is slim, beautiful, trustworthy, loyal and loving. I knew she was the right one for me because I found it easy to talk to her about anything and everything, ” he said.</p>
      <h4>Love Story</h4>
      <p>The couple met in 2010 at a First Bank branch in Lagos where the bride worked as an intern. They subsequently dated for nine years.</p>
      <p>To many, nine years might seem like forever but the lovers said all that mattered was the fact they enjoyed each others company.</p>
      <p>The groom, Samson Ayeni, said, ”It was not easy as we had a whole lot of ups and downs but we never let go of our friendship. We are also quick to apologise to each other and never allowed a third party into our relationship. My wife and I are in this together and committed to make it work.”</p>

      <p>Omolara Ogundipe said, ”He proposed to me at the Maryland mall in Lagos where we went to watch the movie ’ The Wedding Party ’ Part 1 with our friends. I agreed to marry him because he is free-minded and always after anything that will make me happy. He is also kind, handsome and adorable.”</p>
