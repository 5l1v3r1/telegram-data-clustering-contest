      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/enforcement-directorate">Enforcement Directorate </a>(ED) on Monday filed a reply on an application moved by Ranjeet Singh Bindra seeking bail in connection with the alleged business dealings with deceased gangster Iqbal Mirchi.</p>
      <p>The ED had arrested Bindra on October 11 and initially sought his custody from a special court. Subsequently, he was sent to judicial custody till November 7. He had allegedly helped Mirchi grab properties in Mumbai and make huge money through real-estate deals.</p>
      <p>Opposing Bindra's bail, the agency said that he has a "very crucial role in generation and laundering of a huge amount of proceeds of crime and appears to be prima facie guilty of the offence of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/money-laundering">money laundering.</a>"</p>
      <p>The ED further asserted that as the investigation is at the crucial state, he might hamper it and obfuscate the money trail.</p>
      <p>"He is now aware of the directions of the investigation and may tip off other suspected persons to evade the investigation," the ED submitted.</p>
      <p>Besides Bindra, the ED has so far arrested Haroun Aleem Yusuf, Humayun Merchant and Rinku Deshpande.</p>
