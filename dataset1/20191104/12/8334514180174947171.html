      <p>Taylor Swift won “Best U.S. Act” and “Best Video” and Eilish was awarded “Best Song” and “Best New” in a show that celebrated “Year of the Woman” with performances from acts including Dua Lipa, Halsey and Rosalia.</p>
      <p>“We are about that girl power always, I think that’s what’s happening right now,” host Becky G said on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>Liam Gallagher closed the show with his new single “Once” and a singalong rendition of Oasis anthem “Wonderwall”, complete with string instruments and band.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank MTV for recognizing my brilliance,” Gallagher said when receiving the award.</p>
      <p>Korean superstars BTS, who have led the wave of K-pop music sweeping the global scene, won “Best Live” and “Biggest Fans”.</p>
      <p>NCT 127 became the first ever K-pop group to perform on stage at the EMAs.</p>
      <p>“Well, it makes us very nervous to know that we are the first K-pop group to be here but that much more we think it’s important,” said band member Johnny. “We want to show our fans in Europe our great performance.”</p>
      <p>The show at Seville’s FIBES Conference and Exhibition centre also saw the first global performance of “Como No”, the reggaeton hit by Akon and Becky G. She later performed a medley of her hits including “24/7”, “Sin Pijama” and “Mayores”.</p>
      <p>Some of the biggest screams on the red carpet were for a surprise guest, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who arrived with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez.</p>
      <p>American rockers Green Day played for thousands of fans in Seville’s iconic Plaza de Espana, performing their new single “Father of All” and fan favorite “Basket Case”.</p>
      <p>Other notable performances included Halsey, who won “Best Pop”, lighting up the stage for an intimate performance of “Graveyard” during which she set fire to a carousel horse.</p>
      <p>Local girl and international sensation Rosalia gave a powerful performance of “Di Mi Nombre” backed by 52 dancers against a pyramid of red chairs. She won “Best Collaboration” along with J Balvin for their hit “Con Altura ft. El Guincho”.</p>
