      <h1>Same-sex couples able to have both names on child's birth cert under new regulations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:40:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Some same-sex couples will be able to have both names on their child's birth cert under new regulations to be signed into law today.</p>
      <p>However, it will not cover the parents of children born through surrogacy.</p>
      <p>The regulations which will be signed by the Health Minister today will introduce a ban on anonymous sperm donation and the creation of a register for those conceived by a donor.</p>
      <p>It will allow same-sex parents the opportunity to have both names on the birth cert of their child for the first time.</p>
      <p>However, the regulations of the Children and Family Relationships Act do not cover same-sex parents who have children through a surrogate.</p>
      <p>In theory, a woman who donates eggs to the surrogate won't be the name on the child's birth cert despite having a biological connection.</p>
      <p>The Health Minister Simon Harris admits that legislation still needs to evolve, following protests outside the Department a number of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The new regulations will come into effect in May 2020.</p>
