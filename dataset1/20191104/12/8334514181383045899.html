      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s anti-Brexit Liberal Democrat party leader Jo Swinson was the recipient of suspicious package delivered to her office in parliament ahead of the upcoming general election, ITV reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Swinson has toughened her party’s anti-Brexit stance since taking over as leader in July, promising to cancel Brexit if the Liberal Democrats score an unlikely victory in a widely expected early election.</p>
      <p>London’s police said they were alerted to the package just before 1000 GMT on Monday in Portcullis House, where many lawmakers have their offices. The police later ruled it was non-hazardous.</p>
      <p>The package “has now been assessed as non-suspicious,” the police said in a statement. “No reports of any illness or injuries. The premises have not been evacuated. Enquiries continue.”</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the Liberal Democrats.</p>
