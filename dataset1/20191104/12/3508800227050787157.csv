說普通話做文明人？推行普教中根本無需要
04 Nov 2019, 12:11 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是學校和政府希望學生能做到兩文三語，表面上學習普通話令香港學生具備多一種語言能力，但實際上有機會只是停留於低層次的口語翻譯，並未能夠擴闊學生的思維。

林鄭月娥政府發表學校課程檢討專責小組的諮詢文件，其中提到「至於中國語文科，可以探索公開考試的聆聽和／或說話部分，以及校本評核的實施是否可 以修訂或減少以創造空間」[1]，引起大眾關注政府是否想將廣東話趕盡殺絕。由於現時的口試準則需要使用廣東話來應考，不少中學為應付公開考試都不會使用普通話教中國語文科，而多數小學為了應付TSA則在高小時，由「普教中」改為廣東話教中文。修訂或減少公開考試的聆聽和／或說話部分會直接減低學生家長和學校對廣東話的重視程度，令學校推行普教中時更加順利。
普教中是港府和語常會共同推廣普通話的政策，提倡以普通話取代廣東話作為母語教授中國語文科。語常會自08年推出「普教中」，撥款超一億八千萬資助學校推行普教中。由於大量撥款資助，令實施普教中的中小學急升。小學由2008年的55.5%急升至2015年的71.6% ，而中學則由08年的31.8% 上升至36.9% 。團體「港語學」曾發表報告指在小六級全面推行普教中的小學，由15年的161間下跌至148間，反映教育成效被受質疑。[2]
普教中可以提升寫作？
香港教育局從來沒有確實研究證明，以普通話學習中國語文的學生中文能力會有所改善。甚至有兩項研究指出，以普通話學習的學生的中文能力與以廣東話學習的學生，並沒有分別，甚至乎表現更差。而語常會在03年公布的《提升香港語文水平行動方案》[3]雖然指出以普通話學習的學生的寫作能力較以廣東話學習的學生為佳，但這個結論並沒有證據支持，難以說服普羅大眾。
非母語教學語言會阻外學習？
香港大學教育學院中文教育研究中心總監謝錫金教授於2011年參與全球閱讀進展研究，研究結果顯示香港大多以廣東話教中文的小四學生，閱讀能力係全球之冠，較以國語教中文的台灣高。以廣東話教中文沒有要求首先學識拼音，所以學生們需盡快識字，此舉對升提閱讀能力十分重要，而閱讀能力高即會令每一科都學得更快更好。在小一小二的時候需同時學英文和普通話的音標，有機會令學生吃不消，討厭學習中文。因此，謝錫金教授建議應在高小的時候，才以普通話教授中文。
家長的懊惱
現時全港約有九成人以廣東話為母語，不少家長的普通話能力不高，小學階段實施「普教中」，會嚴重影響家長和小朋友在日常生活中溝通和學習。由於家長無從入手，即會減少家庭教育和共同閱讀的習慣，降低小孩的閱讀理解能力。
不少家長反映在小學一年級至三年級的時候以普通話教中文，但在小四以後便轉成了粵語教中文來應付TSA的會話考試，令家長和學生們都感到十分混亂。本來應先學好中文字，然後才學普通話拼音。但由於現在先學了拼音，反而令到學生更難認清中文字，有學等於冇學，本末倒置。不少家長更投訴精英班多以普通話教中文，成續較差的學生便以母語教學，直接和普教中掛勾。其潛台詞就是要貶低自己的文化同母語。
講普通話做文明人？
粵語歷史悠久，是古時中原的語言和部落土話交融後的產物。用粵語讀唐詩才會押韻，以用普通話讀唐詩則許多時不會押韻。現時粵語因大量北方人口到南方打工，加上中國政府不斷推行以普通話教授中文，令廣東省大部份地區的粵語人口持續下降，令其逐漸式微。更有「講普通話做文明人」的說法，矮化方言，令其失去地方色彩，文化色彩和深層意義。粵語深含文化底蘊，如果粵語消失了，對中華文化亦是很大的一個損失。
是否有需要急推小學生盡快學識普通話？
學語文除為了可以與人溝通外，更和我們的思想，感情，看法和思維緊扣在一起。學校和政府希望學生能做到兩文三語，表面上學習普通話令香港學生具備多一種語言能力，但實際上有機會只是停留於低層次的口語翻譯，畢竟普通話和廣東話同屬同一個語系，並未能夠擴闊學生的思維。若政府並未能夠提供確實的證據證明以普通話教學能夠提升學生的中國語文能力，便盲推普教中，削弱學生對自己母語和文化的認識，實在本末倒置。
現時有不少小學、中學甚至乎大學都要求學生必須修讀普通話課，學生學習普通話的機會多不勝數，學生可因應自己的需要來決定，根本沒有需要在初小推行普通話教中文，令人不禁懷疑政府此舉是否一個政治任務？

Do you speak Mandarin as a civilized person? There is no need to promote universal education.
04 Nov 2019, 12:11 by readers


What we want you to know is that the school and the government hope that students can do two languages and three languages. On the surface, learning Mandarin can make Hong Kong students have more than one language ability, but in fact they have the opportunity to stay at a low level of oral translation. Broaden students' thinking.



Text: DanDan (Hong Kong girl concerned about current affairs)
Mrs Lam's consultation paper on the School Curriculum Review Task Force mentioned that ""as for the Chinese Language Branch, you can explore the listening and/or speaking part of the public examination and whether the implementation of the school-based assessment can be revised or reduced to create space""[ 1], causing public concern whether the government wants to kill Cantonese. As the current oral examination criteria require the use of Cantonese to take the test, many secondary schools will not use Putonghua to teach Chinese Language for public examinations. Most primary schools will change from ""Public Education"" to Cantonese in order to cope with TSA. teach Chinese. Revising or reducing the listening and/or speaking part of the public examination will directly reduce the importance of parents and schools in Cantonese, making the school more successful in promoting general education.
In the general education, the Hong Kong Government and the SCOLAR jointly promote the Putonghua policy and advocate the replacement of Cantonese in Putonghua as a native language to teach Chinese Language. Since 2008, the SCOLAR has launched ""Popular Education"", which has allocated more than 180 million grants to schools to promote universal education. Due to the large amount of grants, the implementation of primary and secondary schools in the general education has soared. Primary schools rose sharply from 55.5% in 2008 to 71.6% in 2015, while secondary schools rose from 31.8% in 2008 to 36.9%. The group ""Knowledge Studies"" has published a report that the primary schools in the general education level at the sixth grade have been reduced from 161 to 148 in 15 years, reflecting that education effectiveness has been questioned. [2]
Can general writing improve in general education?
The Hong Kong Education Bureau has never really proved that the Chinese language ability of students learning Chinese in Mandarin will improve. There are even two studies pointing out that the Chinese language ability of students studying in Putonghua is no different from that of students studying in Cantonese. The SCOLAR's ""Action Plan for Enhancing the Language Proficiency in Hong Kong"" published in 2003[3] pointed out that students who study in Putonghua are better at writing than those who study in Cantonese. However, this conclusion has no evidence to support and it is difficult to convince Pro. public.
Non-native language teaching language will hinder learning?
Professor Xie Xijin, Director of the Chinese Education Research Center of the University of Hong Kong, participated in the Global Reading Progress Study in 2011. The results show that most of the students in Hong Kong who teach Chinese in Cantonese have the highest reading ability in the world. high. Teaching Chinese in Cantonese does not require you to learn Pinyin first, so students need to read literacy as soon as possible. This is very important for reading ability, and reading ability will make each subject learn faster and better. In the small one and two, you need to learn the phonetic symbols of both English and Mandarin at the same time. There is an opportunity for students to eat and hate learning Chinese. Therefore, Professor Xie Xijin suggested that Chinese should be taught in Mandarin when he was a child.
Parental annoyance
At present, about nine adults in Hong Kong are native speakers of Cantonese. Many parents have low Putonghua proficiency. The implementation of ""universal education"" in primary school will seriously affect the communication and learning of parents and children in their daily lives. Because parents can't start, they will reduce the habit of family education and reading, and reduce their reading comprehension.
Many parents reported that they taught Chinese in Putonghua when they were in the first grade to the third grade of primary school. However, after the fourth grade, they turned into Cantonese to teach Chinese to cope with the TSA conversation test, which made parents and students feel very confused. I should have learned Chinese characters first, and then I learned Pinyin in Mandarin. However, since I have learned Pinyin first, it is harder for students to recognize Chinese characters. Learning is equal to dropping out of school. Many parents have complained that the elite class teaches Chinese in Putonghua. Students who are in poorer succession will teach in their mother tongue and directly link with the general education. The subtext is to devalue his own culture and mother tongue.
Do you speak Mandarin as a civilized person?
Cantonese has a long history and is a product of the fusion of the language of the Central Plains and the tribal language. Reading Tang poetry in Cantonese will rhyme, and reading Tang poetry in Putonghua will not rhyme many times. At present, Cantonese is working in the south due to a large number of northern populations. The Chinese government continues to promote the use of Mandarin to teach Chinese, which has caused the Cantonese population in most parts of Guangdong Province to continue to decline. There is also a saying that ""speaking Mandarin as a civilized person"", dwarfing dialects, which makes it lose its local color, cultural color and deep meaning. Cantonese has a profound cultural heritage. If Cantonese disappears, it will be a great loss to Chinese culture.
Is there a need to push primary school students to learn Mandarin as soon as possible?
In addition to being able to communicate with people, learning Chinese is closely related to our thoughts, feelings, opinions and thinking. Schools and the government hope that students can do two languages and three languages. On the surface, learning Mandarin can make Hong Kong students have more than one language ability, but in fact they have the opportunity to stay at a low-level oral translation. After all, Mandarin and Cantonese belong to the same language family. It has not been able to broaden students' thinking. If the Government fails to provide definitive evidence that teaching in Putonghua can enhance students' Chinese language proficiency, it will be put on the ground and weaken students' understanding of their mother tongue and culture.
At present, there are many primary schools, secondary schools and even universities that require students to take Putonghua classes. There are many opportunities for students to learn Putonghua. Students can decide according to their own needs. There is no need to promote Putonghua in the first few years to teach Chinese. Can't help wondering if the government's move is a political task?
