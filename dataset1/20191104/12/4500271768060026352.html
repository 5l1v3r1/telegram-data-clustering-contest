      <p>Dawn.com looks back at the major developments since August 5, when India unilaterally annexed occupied Kashmir.</p>
      <p>On November 3, the lockdown imposed in occupied Kashmir on August 5 by the Indian government crossed ninety days. The security and communication clampdown has now entered its fourth month.</p>
      <p>With international pressure mounting to restore freedoms, Indian authorities claim they have 'eased' some restrictions, such as lifting roadblocks and restoring landlines and some mobile phone services. The scenario for 12.5 million Kashmiris, however, is far from normal.</p>
      <p>The shutdown disrupted business and schools and demoralised the people. Mass arrests of Kashmiri leaders were made as the government announced revoking the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian constitution.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, on October 31, the region was split into two so-called federal territories.</p>
      <p>Here, <i>Dawn.com</i> looks back at the major developments over the last 3 months in relation to occupied Kashmir.</p>

        <b>Aug 3: Tourists flee, troop buildup creates panic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thousands of tourists and students scrambled to get places on planes and buses leaving Indian-occupied Kashmir after the Indian government warned of the threat of “terror” attacks. Panic gripped occupied Kashmir since late July after India announced deploying at least 10,000 more soldiers to one of the world's highest militarised areas.</p>

        <b>Aug 5: India revokes Article 370 through rushed presidential decree</b>
      </p>
      <p>With an indefinite security lockdown in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) and elected representatives under house arrest, India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227/india-revokes-occupied-kashmirs-special-autonomy-through-rushed-presidential-decree">stripped Kashmiris of the special autonomy</a> they had for seven decades through a rushed presidential order.</p>
      <p>By repealing Article 370 of the constitution, people from the rest of India will now have the right to acquire property in occupied Kashmir and settle there permanently. Kashmiris as well as critics of India’s Hindu nationalist-led government see the move as an attempt to dilute the demographics of Muslim-majority Kashmir with Hindu settlers.</p>

      <p>Although the council did not agree on a statement, China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun summed up the discussions, expressing serious concern over the situation.</p>
      <p>“The UNSC members are concerned about the human rights situation there and they (want) the parties concerned to refrain from taking any unilateral action that might further aggravate the tension there since the situation is already very tense and very dangerous,” he said.</p>

        <b>Oct 24: India holds village council polls despite lockdown, boycott by parties</b>
      </p>
      <p>Village council elections were <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1512678/india-holds-village-council-polls-in-occupied-kashmir-despite-lockdown-boycott-by-parties">held across occupied Kashmir</a>, with the detention of many mainstream local politicians and a boycott by most parties prompting expectations that the polls would install supporters of BJP.</p>
      <p>Indian officials hoped the election of leaders of more than 300 local councils would lend credibility amid a political vacuum and contended they would represent local interests better than corrupt state-level political officials.</p>
      <p>Heavy contingents of police and paramilitary soldiers guarded polling stations across the region. At some places, soldiers patrolled streets around polling stations. Police said no violence was reported.</p>

        <b>Oct 29: Far-right Euro MPs visit occupied Kashmir as UN body demands full restoration of human rights</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nearly 30 Euro MPs, drawn mainly from extreme right-wing parties, were the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1513410/far-right-euro-mps-lead-landmark-trip-to-occupied-kashmir">first international delegation to visit</a> occupied Kashmir since authorities imposed a security clampdown in August to back the ending of the region's autonomy. While the Indian government backed the visit, the European parliament and European Union hierarchy were not involved, raising some diplomatic doubts.</p>
      <p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1513603/un-body-demands-full-restoration-of-human-rights-in-india-occupied-kashmir">expressed "extreme concern"</a> over human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir and asked the Indian authorities to "fully restore" human rights in the occupied territory.</p>
      <p>The human rights body also criticised the Indian judiciary over the way it is dealing with the situation in occupied Kashmir. "The Supreme Court of India has been slow to deal with petitions concerning habeas corpus, freedom of movement and media restrictions," it said.</p>

        <b>Oct 31: Occupied Kashmir officially loses special status and is divided</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shops and offices were shut in occupied Kashmir and the streets largely deserted as federal authorities <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1514013/shops-shuttered-streets-deserted-as-occupied-kashmir-loses-special-status-and-is-divided">formally revoked</a> the restive area’s constitutional autonomy and split it into two federal territories.</p>

      <p>Just after midnight on Oct 30, the federal government’s orders went into effect, dividing up occupied Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories; one Jammu and Kashmir, and the other the Buddhist-dominated high altitude region of Ladakh. “Everything changes on Thursday,” said a retired Kashmiri judge, Hasnain Masoodi, a member of India’s Parliament. “The entire exercise is unconstitutional. The mode and methodology have been undemocratic. People were humiliated and never consulted.”</p>
