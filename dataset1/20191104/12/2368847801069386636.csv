英冷凍貨櫃39屍案 越南警方再逮捕8人

04 Nov 2019, 12:01

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】英國警方10月23日在艾塞克斯郡（Essex）的一輛冷凍貨櫃內發現39具屍體，經警方持續追查發現，受害者都是越南公民。越南警方日前逮捕了2名疑似涉案人士，3日又逮捕另外8人。
英國艾塞克斯郡警方1日發表聲明說，上個月冷凍貨櫃車發現的39具偷渡客屍體，由於受害者攜帶的身分證件稀少，辨識身分不易，一度傳出死者全為中國籍，但後來發現可能是越南籍人士使用偽造的中國護照。
越南「民智報」新聞網站今天(4日)報導，截至4日為止，越南共有21個來自義安省（Nghe An）的家庭、10個來自河靜省（Ha Tinh）的家庭以及若干來自其他省分的家庭向當地政府通報，親人前往英國後失聯並請求協尋。

中部義安省（Nghe An）公安廳廳長阮友球（Nguyen Huu Cau）上午表示，這是震驚國際社會的人道悲劇，當地警方昨天以類似罪名逮捕8名涉案人士，案件正在調查中。
另外，中部河靜省（Ha Tinh）警方1日以「組織與仲介他人逃往國外或在國外非法居留」罪名起訴與逮捕2名疑似涉及此案的人士，但未公開這2人姓名。
為查明死者身分，越南公安部與外交部已組團前往英國配合調查；英國警方也與越南相關機構合作透過指紋、DNA等方法辨識死者身分。
