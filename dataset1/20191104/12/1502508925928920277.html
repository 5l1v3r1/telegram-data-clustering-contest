      <h1>IndiGo says systems back to normal after outage hits flyers across network</h1>
      <h2>Hassled travellers affected by IndiGo's outage posted pictures on Twitter of long lines at check-in counters at major airports</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:21:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's largest airline <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said on Monday its flights and check-in systems were running normally, after an hours-long outage hit operations at airports, leading to long queues and hassling passengers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said earlier its systems had been down across the network since Monday morning.</p>
      <p>"Our system is up now but has disrupted operations across the network," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said in a Twitter post, adding that it was working to bring operations back to normal.</p>
      <p>The outage added to passenger woes as dozens of Indian flights already faced delays or cancellations on Monday, according to reports, due to a decline in visibility because of air pollution shrouding New Delhi, home to the country's busiest airport.</p>
      <p>Hassled travellers affected by IndiGo's outage posted pictures on Twitter of long lines at check-in counters at major airports.</p>
      <p>"IndiGo says systems down and huge queues till outside the main entrance gates in Mumbai T2. Chaos," one user with the handle @Sathyantweets said in a tweet, referring to Terminal 2 at Mumbai's airport.</p>
      <p>IndiGo, owned by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/interglobe-aviation">Interglobe Aviation </a>Ltd , is the country's largest carrier with a nearly 50% share of the domestic market.</p>
      <p>Interglobe Aviation's shares had fallen 0.3% by 1505 local time (0935 GMT) in Mumbai, while shares in rival airline SpiceJet Ltd were down 2.4%.</p>
