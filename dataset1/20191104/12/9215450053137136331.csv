04 Nov 2019, 12:49 by 樓市
【樓市見底】自行政長官林鄭月娥10月中《施政報告》宣布放寬按保樓價上限，以及向低收入住戶提供現金津貼等措施後，樓市即時由冷轉熱，加上滙豐銀行帶頭減息，確實為樓市火上加油，一眾業主心雄，瘋狂反價。花旗集團中國香港地產研究主管楊海全接受傳媒訪問時明言，樓價已經見底，並將重返較長的正常上升周期，預計往後樓價每月可升1%，今年全年仍有5%升幅，即使明年經濟未明朗化，樓價仍會繼續向上。

花旗：樓市月內便見底
花旗於《施政報告》公布當天曾發表報告，指樓價會較原本預期更早反彈，明年2月前或會見底。花旗集團中國香港地產研究主管楊海全近日向傳媒表示，相信樓市月內便見底，更指現時是買樓好時機，並建議主攻600萬至800萬嘅單位。CCL年初至6月高位一度累飆11%，之後回軟，現時已由高峰下調約6%並見底，估計往後每月回升1%，今年全年樓價可漲約5%，與年初預測相符。至於明年整體表現，他忘為當社會事件理順後，樓市料可恢復正常並能延續升勢，儘管下半年有機會較上半年弱，但全年計依然會上揚。

樓市見底 細單位仍有優勢
事實上，《經濟一週》專欄作者1% Anthony早前接受本網專訪時亦表示預計樓市會加快見底。他認為「買樓上車，大有大買，細有細買！」新政策之下，800萬元以下的單位都可以做到9成按揭，形勢有所不同，「不過買咗都要供嘛，細單位始終LumpSum細，仍有優勢。」
