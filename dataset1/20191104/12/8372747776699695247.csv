Houston, we have dessert: An oven and some cookie dough were sent to space

Houston, we have a cookie.
Astronauts aboard the International Space Station will be able to attempt baking for the first time as a spacecraft carrying a zero-gravity oven and some cookie dough arrived Monday.
The dough comes from none other than DoubleTree by Hilton, the makers of arguably one of the most infamous chocolate chip cookies. The oven was made by Zero G Kitchen, who describe themselves as ""a platform for food development in space.""
""Zero-G Oven explores the possibility and challenges of baking fresh meals in a microgravity environment,"" a description of the NASA experiment says. ""Investigators explore how to heat, then cool the space oven in a manner that is safe for all crew member interaction.""



But it's not all science and heat transfer data. The experiment notes that being able to bake in space could also help astronauts — psychologically and physically — because they would be able to get more flavorful and nutritious meals in space if they're able to cook at zero gravity.
The delicious experiment will involve testing the oven to see how zero gravity and high heat affect the baking process and, specifically, what effect they have on cookies. The Zero-G oven, which uses electrical heat like a toaster, can reach up to 363.3 degrees Celsius, or nearly 686 degrees Fahrenheit.
Hopefully they have oven mitts in space.
