04 Nov 2019, 12:01 by Raka
The camera quality in both the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series is no longer the best available in the market — the latest iPhone models and Pixel 4 series of smartphones dethroned Samsung’s Note10 and S10 series smartphones as the best camera smartphones you can buy right now.
Samsung is very much aware of the fierce competition and is trying to bring a better camera and it appears that the upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone is what Samsung will be relying heavily upon to re-claim its camera supremacy.
According to reliable leaker Ice Universe, there is a high degree of probability that the Galaxy S11 will use the 108MP Samsung ISOCELL Bright (S5KHMX) image sensor. a new 108MP Samsung image sensor. However, the Galaxy S11 won’t be the first smartphone to have such a huge camera sensor, the reason being the fact that The new image sensor would be different from what you’ll find in Xiaomi’s Mi Note 10 flagship smartphone, which is all set to be launched tomorrow. The real challenge for Samsung will be the optimization of the camera and for that, a lot of effort needs to be put in making the camera software work well.



That said, key differences between the existing 108MP and the new 108MP Samsung image sensor is still unknown.
Otherwise, the much-rumored Exynos 9830 could power Samsung’s upcoming flagship as it appears to be the successor to the Exynos 9820, the processor that powers the Galaxy S10 smartphones.
Galaxy S11 is expected to feature a display with a weird 20:9 aspect ratio, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. This will make the display look a lot like the one you find on the Galaxy A70 and Galaxy A80 as both A70 and A80 have a similar aspect ratio.
The Galaxy S11 is expected to be Samsung’s first flagship smartphone of the year 2020 and as usual, the expectation is also quite high.
