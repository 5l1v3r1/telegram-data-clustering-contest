Former Bayern Munich and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann criticised Philippe Coutinho after Bayern's 5-1 beating by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this weekend.
Hamann previously said: ""He's on loan for a year, played some games with Bayern and for me you can't seen an improvement in his performance.""
This time, of Coutinho who was replaced after 57 minutes for Kingsley Coman, with Bayern 4-1 down, Hamann said Coutinho was ""invisible"".
Hamann also didn't like his attitude. ""What annoys me is when you see this player is not prudent. If he loses a ball he can be frightened and anxious during the 90 minutes.""
Coutinho is on loan at Bayern, who have a 120m euro option to buy. Coach Niko Kovac was sacked this week.
