      <p>Houston, we have a cookie.</p>
      <p>Astronauts aboard the International Space Station will be able to attempt baking for the first time as a spacecraft carrying a zero-gravity oven and some cookie dough arrived Monday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cookiesinspace.com/">dough comes from none other than DoubleTree by Hilton,</a> the makers of arguably one of the most infamous chocolate chip cookies. The oven was made by <a href="https://www.zerogk.space/">Zero G Kitchen,</a> who describe themselves as "a platform for food development in space."</p>
      <p>"Zero-G Oven explores the possibility and challenges of baking fresh meals in a microgravity environment," a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=7993">description of the NASA experiment</a> says. "Investigators explore how to heat, then cool the space oven in a manner that is safe for all crew member interaction."</p>

      <p>But it's not all science and heat transfer data. The experiment notes that being able to bake in space could also help astronauts — psychologically and physically — because they would be able to get more flavorful and nutritious meals in space if they're able to cook at zero gravity.</p>
      <p>The delicious experiment will involve testing the oven to see how zero gravity and high heat affect the baking process and, specifically, what effect they have on cookies. The Zero-G oven, which uses electrical heat like a toaster, can reach up to 363.3 degrees Celsius, or nearly 686 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p>Hopefully they have oven mitts in space.</p>
