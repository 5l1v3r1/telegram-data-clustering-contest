“I don’t think we’ll see him before December. He’ll be out for a while,” he said.
“He needs time to fully recover so I don’t think he will be back before maybe Sheffield United after the international break but probably December before you can see him.
“I’m not a doctor but there is an injury there that needs healing. There’s no use talking about who’s not going to be here for a long time because he’s not going to come on the pitch and help us.""
