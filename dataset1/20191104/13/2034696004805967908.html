      <p>Maisie Williams in Sky’s ‘Two Weeks To Live’</p>
      <p>As she sets off on a secret mission honouring her father’s memory, she meets socially awkward Nicky (Mawaan Rizwan) and his brother Jay (Taheen Modak), setting in motion a series of chaotic events that sees everyone on the run from gangsters and police with a big bag of stolen money.</p>
      <p>The show also stars Kerry Howard, Thalissa Teixeira and Jason Flemyng.</p>
      <p>Williams finished her run as Arya Stark on <i>Game of Thrones</i> earlier this year, and recently revealed that the show’s writers pranked star Kit Harington by claiming that his character Jon Snow would be <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-writers-pranked-jon-snow-that-hed-be-mauled-on-the-face-2561127">“hugely disfigured”</a>.</p>

      <p>“They said he got really aggressively mauled on the face and he was going to have a huge disfigurement on his beautiful, chiselled jaw,” she explained. “That one was quite funny, poor guy.”</p>
      <p>The actress also revealed that she <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-showrunners-reveal-chaotic-way-they-started-work-on-the-show-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-2562221">almost missed her audition for the show</a> because she wanted to go to a pig farm on a school trip.</p>
      <p>“My mum really put her foot down and I was kinda mad about it, I really wanted to go on that school trip,” Williams revealed. “I wouldn’t be here today, you wouldn’t want me on the show if I’d have gone to the pig farm!”</p>
