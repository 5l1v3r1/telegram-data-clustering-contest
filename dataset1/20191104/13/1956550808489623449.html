      <p>We all scream for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids/410291-the-uaes-best-ice-creams">ice cream</a>, but when it’s free? That’s a shriek of excitement we’ll always remember when we see a yellow van from <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/419919-expo-2020-dubai-1-year-to-go">Expo 2020 Dubai</a> coming our way.<br/><br/>In the lead up to ‘The World’s Greatest Show’, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/topics/expo-2020-dubai">Expo 2020 Dubai</a> revealed that a van <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">will be travelling across</a> the UAE to give out more than 40,000 ice creams – completely free.<br/><br/>Taking place over the next several weeks, Expo shared on its Twitter account that it will be handing out free ice cream to everyone. As to where to find it? It will reveal where it will be setting up, so watch this site for further information.<br/><br/>As the video states, it is <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/topics/expo-2020-dubai">Expo 2020 Dubai</a>’s way of “connecting with people across the UAE.” Free ice cream sounds like the right remedy.<br/><br/>“It is a day that will affect our entire region and its children, youth and elderly, as well as its governments and peoples,” said director general of the Expo 2020 Dubai told our sister site Arabian Business.<br/><br/>“We have never had this opportunity to showcase our achievements, cultures, heritage and aspirations and dreams to the entire world on a global platform.”<br/><br/>Can’t wait to get some from the van?
