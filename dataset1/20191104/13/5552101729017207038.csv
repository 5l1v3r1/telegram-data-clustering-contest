「有氧天王」潘若迪上週六日（11/2-11/3）展開亞洲巡迴，24小時旋風趕攤新加坡、馬來西亞2國，挑戰體力極限。潘若迪所到之處被粉絲簇擁，他笑說：「就連我去廁所都跟著。」讓他過足天王癮，但卻也因此鬧笑話，誤以為Uber司機也是粉絲，險沒給車資坐霸王車。
潘若迪這次橫跨星馬2國巡迴，時間緊迫，第一天晚上落地新加坡，隨即上台教學，半夜用完晚餐，趕夜車到馬來西亞，第二天凌晨4點入睡，早上9點進行彩排，一路忙到半夜又驅車返回新加坡，體力與時間壓力的耗損，簡直上演不可能任務。所幸熱情粉絲無時不刻應援，接機、送禮讓他備感窩心，但也因此鬧出笑話。
潘若迪早上從飯店搭Uber到會場，一路上司機對他笑臉盈盈，下車時他見司機還特地搖下車窗對他比手指愛心，他暗爽回頭說：「I love you too」不料司機卻猛按喇叭大喊：「money！give me money」潘若迪才恍然大悟，司機比的是數鈔票手勢，示意他還沒付錢，「我當時糗到要挖地洞，我還以為司機也是我粉絲，對我頻頻示好，誰知道是工作人員沒先付錢」。

他這次巡迴，2場巡迴共吸引800多名粉絲，把會場擠得水泄不通，所有人隨著潘若迪舞動肢體，場面十分壯觀，他事後開玩笑：「簡直就像在做法會一樣。」粉絲的熱情讓他在台上卯足全勁，三不五時就撩粉：「我眼裡都是你、你美翻了。」見粉絲暗爽，隨即回馬槍：「這些鬼話你也信啊！」綜藝哏逗得粉絲笑到合不攏嘴。他跳得興起，忍不住下台和粉絲互動，沒想到才剛下舞台樓梯，粉絲們突然全撲上，他寸步難行只得回台上，邊走還忍不住邊喊道：「你們的手安份點，別亂摸啦！」

""Aerobic King"" Pan Ruodi started the Asian tour on Saturday and Sunday (11/2-11/3), and a 24-hour whirlwind rushed to Singapore and Malaysia to challenge the physical limit. Pan Ruodi was surrounded by fans. He smiled and said, ""Even if I go to the toilet, I will follow."" Let him get through the king's addiction, but he also made a joke, mistakenly thought that Uber driver is also a fan, and he did not give the car to the car. .
Pan Ruodi was on a tour of the two countries across the Star Horse. The time was tight. I landed in Singapore on the first night. I went to school and went to dinner in the middle of the night. I drove the night train to Malaysia. I fell asleep at 4 am the next day and rehearsed at 9 am. Busy to drive to Singapore in the middle of the night, physical and time pressure loss, simply staged impossible tasks. Fortunately, the enthusiastic fans always help, and picking up the phone and giving gifts makes him feel at ease, but it also makes a joke.
Pan Ruodi took the Uber from the hotel to the venue in the morning. The driver smiled at him on the way. When he got off the bus, he saw the driver and shook the window to him more than his fingers. He said with a smile: ""I love you too"" but the driver pressed hard. The speaker shouted: ""money!give me money"" Pan Ruodi realized that the driver was counting a few banknote gestures, indicating that he had not paid the money. ""I was rushing to dig holes. I thought the driver was also my fan. Show well, who knows that the staff did not pay first.""


The local fans enthusiastically participated in the meeting and squeezed the meeting place, let Pan Ruodi laugh: like in practice. (Aidi Sheng spread offers)

On this tour, he attracted more than 800 fans in two tours, and the meeting was crowded. Everyone danced with Pan Ruodi. The scene was very spectacular. He joked afterwards: ""It’s just like doing it."" Fans’ enthusiasm He was full of strength on the stage, and he smashed the powder at three o'clock: ""I have you in your eyes, you have turned beautiful."" Seeing the fans are dark, and then returning to the carbine: ""You can also believe these ghosts!"" I laughed at the fans and laughed. He jumped up and couldn't help but step down and interact with the fans. I didn't expect to just step down the stage stairs. The fans suddenly rushed all over. He had to go back to the stage and couldn't help but shouted: ""Your hand is safe."" Don't touch it!""
