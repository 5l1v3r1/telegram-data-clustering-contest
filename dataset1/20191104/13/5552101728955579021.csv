台語歌后王瑞霞相隔6年回歸歌壇，推出全新台語大碟《霞姐直播中》，特別飛往四川美麗小鎮香格里拉拍攝MV，為徹底傳達新歌《十月的香格里拉》意境。王瑞霞為作品拚了命付出，卻因為高山症病發嚴重缺氧，一度造成生命危險，如今回到台灣休養後已康復，回想起那段「鬼門關前走一遭」的經驗，王瑞霞形容：「回來後醉氧了3天才恢復」。
王瑞霞罹患高山症這件事情讓親友都超級擔憂，加上當時高原上網路不佳聯繫不上本人，她相當愧疚造成親朋好友的麻煩，仍然對當地美景給予高度讚美，至於未來是否還願意再去？她信誓旦旦：「我樂意當導遊，有人約我就去，但怕揪不到人！」她表示，對著老公女兒推薦當地美景，更笑刻意淡化「 高山症沒什麼啦！帶著氧氣筒吸一吸就好了」，沒想到女兒卻無奈拒絕：「不要！我們不要缺氧，要是昏倒了誰救誰」讓她是好氣又好笑。

《十月的香格里拉》MV在YouTube頻道正式上架，把所有美景盡收眼底，卻被眼尖粉絲發現，其中一幕王瑞霞直接躺在零下10度的雪地橋段，恰巧與韓劇《來自星星的你》女主角千頌伊的浪漫橋段「雪天使遊戲」呼應，被笑封是「台語版千頌伊」，她打趣回應「什麼！我當然樂於接受！」

王瑞霞近來為新輯密集宣傳，巧的是，與好姊妹蔡秋鳳同時發片撞期，但彼此豪無火藥味，上週趁著空檔相約蔡秋鳳、張秀卿3位歌后聚餐，各自吐槽、吐苦水，分享閨密心事，超過4小時的心靈雞湯時間，被問及是否姐妹鬩牆？她笑答：「都是認識超過30年的好友，看著後浪新人輩出有壓力，我們不想趴在沙灘上。」2人更相約要一起跑通告宣傳更有伴！

Wang Ruixia went to the plateau to shoot MV Ghost Gate and went back to Taiwan. ""Drunk oxygen"" for 3 days to recover.

After the Taiwanese song, Wang Ruixia returned to the music scene six years later, and launched a new Taiwanese album ""Xiajie Live"", especially to the beautiful town of Shangri-La, Sichuan, to shoot the MV, in order to thoroughly convey the new song ""La Shangri-La"". Wang Ruixia has worked hard for her work, but she was seriously deprived of oxygen due to the disease of Takayama. She once caused her life. Now she has returned to Taiwan and recovered after recuperation. Recalling the experience of ""going before the ghost gate,"" Wang Ruixia described: After returning, I was drunk for 3 days to recover.""
Wang Ruixia suffers from mountain sickness, which makes her relatives and friends worry too much. In addition, the poor network on the plateau could not contact me. She was quite troubled by her relatives and friends. She still highly praised the local beauty. As for whether she is willing to go again in the future. ? She vowed: ""I am willing to be a tour guide. Someone will go to me, but I am afraid that I will not be able to meet people!"" She said that she would recommend the local beauty to her husband's daughter, and even laugh and deliberately downplay. ""Nothing is good! Take a gas cylinder."" I just sucked it. I didn’t expect my daughter to help but refuse: ""Don't! We don't want oxygen, if we faint, who will save it"" makes her angry and funny.

""October Shangri-La"" MV was officially launched on the YouTube channel, and all the beauty is unobstructed, but it was discovered by the eye-catching fans. One of the scenes, Wang Ruixia, was lying directly on the snow bridge at minus 10 degrees, coincidentally with the Korean drama ""You from the Stars"" The romantic bridge of the heroine, Chitose, echoes the ""Snow Angel Game"". She is laughed at ""Taiwanese version of the Millennium"". She is joking to respond to ""what! I am willing to accept it!""

Wang Ruixia has recently intensively promoted the new series. Coincidentally, at the same time, she and her sister, Cai Qiufeng, made a collision at the same time. However, they have no gunpowder taste. They last week sang together with Cai Qiufeng and Zhang Xiuqing to share the three songs, and they vomited and spit. Sharing my heart and mind, more than 4 hours of soul chicken soup time, was asked if the sisters smashed the wall? She smiled and said: ""It’s all friends who have known each other for more than 30 years. Looking at the new wave of new generations, we don’t want to kneel on the beach.” 2 people are more willing to run together to announce the promotion and more companionship!
