Fury Over Indian Minister's Suggestion to ‘Eat Carrot' to Be Healthy in Smog-Choked Delhi

04 Nov 2019, 13:05


New Delhi (Sputnik): As odd-even vehicle rationing scheme to reduce traffic on the roads of New Delhi kicked off today as part of efforts to combat the toxic air-smearing the city with grey fumes. But some bizarre suggestions from Indian ministers have infuriated local residents.

Suggestions from government ministers ranging from eating carrots and listening to music to performing oblation as ways to counter the pollution-related problems of Delhi have irked residents of the smoke-smeared city.
Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan suggested in a tweet on Sunday that eating carrots is not only beneficial for blindness but also helps in fighting against pollution-related ills.



The Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar, who had been squabbling with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over measures to tackle the public health emergency, recommended “scintillating thematic” music to people struggling for clean air to breath. 



Another suggestion came from Sunil Bharala, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, who suggested that yajna, a fire ritual done as an oblation in Hinduism, should be performed to please the Rain God. He also said farmers have always practiced stubble burning and that this is a “natural system”.
The statements from the ministers drew an instant backlash on social media.












Netizens' reactions also highlighted public resentment regarding the government’s lack of preventive measures in response to the crisis.



Others responded with memes while saying, people have to be alive to enjoy your music suggestions.












The spike in air pollutants to “hazardous” levels and poor visibility is forcing dozens of flights to divert from Delhi.
The central government held a high-level meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis, which is caused by stubble burning, busy traffic, industrial production, and poor weather conditions.
Authorities have already declared a public emergency after the pollutant levels in the air hit record highs.
