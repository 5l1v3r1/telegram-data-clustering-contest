        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> has admitted his frustration at being given a five-second time penalty for his collision with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a>, which ultimately cost him points at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kvyat was on for a points finish until he was given a five-second time penalty which dropped him down to 12th place. It is the second race in a row that the Russian has been penalised for a move late in the race, having been punished for colliding with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/mexican-grand-prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a>.</p>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> driver admitted he was very disappointed with the outcome and feels it isn't good for the sport.</p>
      <p><i>“It was a tricky race, we were a little bit off the pace today compared to our direct competitors,"</i> Kvyat said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"We used the tyres a bit more than we usually do, so we need to analyse that. Even with those issues, I managed to finish P10 on track on the last lap.</i>

        <i>"I think was a harsh but fair move, it was great racing like we want to see and what we have seen this season without other drivers being penalised.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I’m very upset and disappointed about this penalty because I don’t think this is what our sport needs.”</i>
