      <p>Representatives of some employee unions and officer associations of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mtnl">MTNL </a>met <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom">Telecom </a>Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday and offered their full support to the relief package, VRS and asset monetisation plans announced by the government recently, sources said.</p>
      <p>It may be recalled that the government last month had approved a plum Rs 69,000 crore revival package for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mtnl">MTNL </a>that includes merging the two loss-making firms, monetising their assets and giving VRS to employees so that the combined entity turns profitable in two years.</p>
      <p>The minister had on Friday (November 1) directed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bsnl">BSNL </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mtnl">MTNL </a>to implement VRS guidelines quickly, and initiate proactive measures to monetise assets in a time-bound manner, while making it clear that they must become more aggressive in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom">telecom </a>market.</p>

      <p>The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, on October 23, approved a plan to combine Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) - which provides services in Mumbai and New Delhi - with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) that services the rest of the nation.</p>
      <p>The rescue package approved includes infusion of Rs 20,140 crore capital for purchase of 4G spectrum, Rs 3,674 crore for GST to be paid on spectrum allocation, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>raising Rs 15,000 crore in debt on the sovereign guarantee and government funding Rs 17,160 crore voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and another Rs 12,768 crore towards retirement liability.</p>
      <p>The two firms will monetise assets worth Rs 37,500 crore in the next three years.</p>
      <p>MTNL has reported losses in nine of the past 10 years and BSNL too has been ringing in loss since 2010. The total debt on both the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>stood at Rs 40,000 crore, of which half of the liability is on MTNL alone.</p>
