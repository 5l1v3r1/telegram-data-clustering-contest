      <p>“Obinna and I had this planned together.</p>
      <p>“The gun was a toy gun. He entered the hotel room and held the lady at gun point. I told her to co –operate, naked her for Obinna to take her pictures. We took seven different shots of her in the nude with my phone. I discharged her that day. This was in September.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “by early October, 2019, I called her to give me N80,000 or I would throw the nude photographs online. She was only able to offer me N10,000, which she transferred into my brother’s account.</p>
