      <p>The Senegalese winger was sublime for the Reds last season, but has seemingly taken his game to new heights in the 2019/20 campaign so far.</p>
      <p>Mane's brilliance over the past year as earned him a place among the nominees for the Ballon d'Or, which he will challenge teammates Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk for, as well as the two five-time winners.</p>
      <p>Asked if he sees himself on a similar level to the FC Barcelona and Juventus forwards, the Senegal superstar insisted he is still working hard to match up to them.</p>
      <p>"These players are monsters," he said, according to the <i>Daily Star.</i></p>
      <p>"I think that I am still far away from them.</p>
      <p>"As I have said, I am going to do everything I can to come a little closer to them."</p>

      <p>Mane also admitted that winning the prestigious individual prize is something he has always dreamed of.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, as I've said, it has always been a childhood dream of mine," he added.Â </p>
      <p>"The fact that I am listed as one of the nominees is due to the fruits of the work that I've been putting in for a long time.</p>
      <p>"This is more of a dream than an obsession, I am at the service of the collective first and foremost.</p>
      <p>"And if I am able to distinguish myself amongst this collective then, of course, the Ballon d'Or has always been my dream. And when a dream comes true, it is always exceptional.</p>
      <p>"All of the Senegalese people, my friends, my family, would be so happy, I would be so happy."</p>
