A shocked dog walker has issued a warning to pet owners after discovering food laced with a mysterious crystal-like substance and pins during a walk in a Glasgow park.
Local dog walking provider Tartan Pet Services was walking through Titwood Park in the Pollokshields area on Monday morning when they made the discovery.
A photo from the park shows what looks like two potatoes with around seven pins on each with what has been described as a “white crystal substance” sprinkled on top.
They have now warned pet owners and parents to be careful around the park, which is used frequently by children and dog walkers.
 
In a Facebook post, they said: “Pollokshields walk just started and this is what I’ve come across.
“Seriously what is wrong with people. Please please please be careful.
“This was found outside the gate at Titwood Park on Glencairn Drive where children and dogs both frequent, so please watch your children and dog in case they anything.
“There was white crystal substances sprinkled on top and around which has been removed too but just to keep a look out.”
An update on the discovery reveals that the police have been contacted.
Police Scotland have been approached for comment.
