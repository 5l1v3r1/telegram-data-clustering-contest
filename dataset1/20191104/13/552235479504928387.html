      <h1>Celtic fans to dwarf Lazio numbers as ticket sales for Europa League clash revealed</h1>
      <h2>Over half of the tickets sold for the match have gone to visiting fans.</h2>

      <p>Celtic fans could vastly outnumber Lazio for Thursday's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> clash, as the Italian club reveals slow ticket sales.</p>
      <p>The competition is not one which particularly captures the imagination in Italy, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> averaging just 16,000 fans last season, compared to around 37,000 in Serie A.</p>
      <p>The Stadio Olimpico has a capacity of over 70,000 and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> supporters could well be the majority for the match.</p>
      <p>Marketing director Marco Canigiani said on <i><b>Lazio Style Radio</b> </i>: "A bus service will be available for Lazio-Celtic, but it's directly proportional to the demand from the fans for this match.</p>

      <p>"For the game on Thursday we've sold over 14,000 tickets but the majority of that number has gone to Celtic. We expect a growth in sales of those available to <i>Biancocelesti</i> fans.</p>
      <p>"Thursday will be an important match in terms of qualification, the team will need support for it.</p>
      <p>"The prices are also very reasonable for Thursday's match, hopefully we can be in the majority at the Stadio Olimpico considering there will be around 9,000 fans from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> in the away end."</p>
      <p>The Curva Nord where Lazio's Irriducibili ultras sit will be closed for the game, after fans gave fascist salutes in the last home game against Rennes.</p>
