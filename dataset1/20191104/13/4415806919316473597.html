      <h1>Opposition TDs seek removal of 'money message' veto in Dáil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:40:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/daniel-mcconnell/" target="_blank">By Daniel McConnell</a></address>
      <p>The Government's use of an “undemocratic veto” in Dáil Éireann has seen more than 50 Opposition bills blocked, despite having majority support in the chamber.</p>
      <p>An Opposition bill, proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit, seeks to unblock that veto over the so-called 'money message' which requires Government approval for a bill to proceed.</p>
      <p>The bill seeks to amend the current Dáil rules to remove the Government's ability to block a bill on money grounds on the basis of potential “incidental expenses and indirect cost” implications.</p>
      <p>While the money message provision is written into the Constitution, those proposing the bill are arguing that Dáil rules go further than that and as a result, many bills are being blocked on frivilous grounds.</p>
      <p>The constitution stops opposition members from progressing bills that would involve the appropriation of public money.</p>
      <p>“The Dail's Standing Orders go further than what's written in the Constitution,” said researcher Conor O'Neill at a press conference in Dublin.</p>
      <p>“So the standing orders stop opposition bills going forward where they appropriate revenue, as well as a number of incidental administrative expenses that have essentially meant this, the government have fashioned themselves and near effective veto on the capacity of the dollar to pass legislation.”</p>
      <p>“We have seen a situation where the government or be able to see the Dail, and vote in overwhelming majority in favor of a bill, and then veto it on very very vague, very undefined cost grounds,” said TD Richard Boyd Barrett.</p>

      <p>"The use and abuse of the money message by the government amounts to an outrageous sabotage of democracy.</p>
      <p>“The voter gate scandal is a shocking instance of some Dáil deputies from Fianna Fáil showing utter contempt for the constitution and the integrity of the voting system.</p>
      <p>“But the government’s flagrant abuse of the money message to block hills which have been democratically passed by a majority in the Dáil is an equally scandalous instance of the government itself showing complete contempt for the constitution and for democracy,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also at the launch, Rise TD Paul Murphy said: ”Unfortunately, the vote gate scandal is just the latest indication of a problem with democracy in the Dáil.</p>
      <p>"The most blatant example is the abuse by the government of the ’money message’ procedure, which they have used to block over 50 Bills, despite them being voted for by a majority in the Dáil.</p>
      <p>"This ’executive veto’ allows them to simply ignore the will of the majority of the Dáil on a range of issues, including the Objective Sex Education Bill, the Anti-Evictions Bill and the Climate Emergency Bill."</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy said the bill will place pressure on Fianna Fáil to decide whether they will back the removal of the veto or not.</p>
