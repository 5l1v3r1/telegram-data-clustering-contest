      <h1>'A national disgrace': Bongino calls out Maryland county exec for banning 'thin blue line' flag</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:29:44+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Nelson</a></address>
      <p>Former Secret Service agent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-al-baghdadi-headline-bongino">Dan Bongino</a> tore into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-county-exec-bans-police-thin-blue-line-flag-divisive">a Maryland official</a> who banned a "thin blue line" flag from being displayed at a local police station, calling the move a “national disgrace."</p>
      <p>“This is certainly a new low in a county in Maryland that is used to lows. This is really a national disgrace,” the Fox News contributor told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">“Fox &amp; Friends”</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Montgomery County executive Marc Elrich <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-county-exec-bans-police-thin-blue-line-flag-divisive">said</a> the wooden “thin blue line” flag, a gift from a local resident, would not be displayed at a police station or any other public buildings.</p>

      <p>"The flag provides a symbol of support to some but it is a symbol of dismissiveness to others,” Elrich said in a note. “Because it is divisive, the flag will not be posted at the 5th District nor in any public space within the Police Department."</p>

      <p>The wooden flag, a gift to the 5th District officers from Montgomery County woodworker James Shelton, is labeled by some as a "blue lives matter" flag and an apparent response to the "Black Lives Matter" movement.</p>
      <p>A photo on the Montgomery County Police Twitter page Wednesday shows Shelton and his young son presenting the artwork to three uniformed officers.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to resident James Shelton, who presented Montgomery County 5th District officers with a wooden American Flag that he had made in recognition of National First Responders Day. The flag will be displayed in the 5th District Station."</p>

      <p>Bongino, a former Maryland resident who ran for a U.S. Senate seat there in 2012, called out the “social justice warrior, marshmallow-eating, Snuggie-wearing Twitter warriors who seem to find offense in everything, including 'Teletubby' episodes.”</p>
      <p>“The radical left has taken over the Democratic Party and law enforcement is going to suffer because of it,” Bongino said, lamenting that the symbol – meant to honor fallen officers – has become controversial.</p>
