      <h1>North Carolina man arrested for impersonating cop after pulling over murder suspect at gunpoint, police say</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina">North Carolina</a> man was charged with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">impersonating a police officer</a> after he allegedly joined the real deal in chasing down – <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">and seemingly arresting</a> – a murder suspect last month.</p>
      <p>David Adams, 30, was taken into custody Wednesday in connection with an incident that unfolded around 11 p.m. on Oct. 5, when officers stopped five people in a car outside a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">grocery store in Wilson</a>. Police reportedly believed one of the vehicle's occupants was a murder suspect.</p>

      <p>When officers approached the vehicle, however, the car took off, <a href="https://www.witn.com/cont">WITN reported</a>. Cops chased the vehicle for a couple of miles before a man, later identified as Adams, driving a black Ford Taurus with blue lights sped past them and intervened — reportedly cornering the suspect's vehicle between his car and the pursuing officers.</p>

      <p>Adams allegedly ordered the driver out of the vehicle at gunpoint and handcuffed him. Wilson Police Department officers weren't sure who Adams was or if he was a law enforcement officer, so they ordered him to stop searching the suspect.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old eventually left the scene, but on Wednesday <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">was charged</a> with impersonating a law enforcement officer, online arrest records indicate.</p>

      <p>The five people inside the vehicle that Adams helped stop were also reportedly arrested – by actual police officers – on various charges.</p>
