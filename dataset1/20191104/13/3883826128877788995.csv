Woman awakes to find bull in back garden

04 Nov 2019, 13:26


A woman woke up to find a bull staring up at her from her back garden.

The weighty bovine, named Arnold, smashed through a fence in his adjoining field on Sunday.
He trampled the woman's lawn in Raunds, Northamptonshire and took a nap before a farmer arrived to move him on and repair the damage.
The homeowner, who did not want to be named said although she enjoys living next to the cows she was not expecting to see Arnold at such close quarters.


Arnold the bull made a beeline for the benchSubmitted

She wrote on Facebook: ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
""We absolutely love having the cows next door - but he's destroyed our grass.
""He's so heavy he's put loads of massive holes in the garden too.""
