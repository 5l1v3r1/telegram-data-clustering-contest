李民基首演熱血刑警飄Man味　李裕英合作已故男友遺作團隊藏洋蔥

韓劇《大家的謊言》當中李民基首次挑戰恐怖題材及刑警角色，化身重案搜查組刑警「趙泰植」，特地向真正的刑警取經，希望呈現有別以往的演技樣貌。李裕英2年前男友金柱赫因車禍身亡、痛失摯愛，而本劇剛好是由金柱赫生前遺作《Argon》的導演和編劇合作打造，巧妙的合作搭配彷彿是李裕英承接了已故男友的演藝精神。
李裕英劇中飾演為查出父親意外身亡和丈夫離奇失蹤真相，而成為國會議員的「金瑞希」，她表示角色並非自願成為國會議員，因此反而不必刻意模仿真正國會議員有條理的口吻，要呈現的是「懵懂無知的少女感」，也因為角色身處在一個很可怕的情況，李裕英坦言：「每次拍攝都覺得非常害怕且辛苦，必須堅持不懈到最後一刻。」

李民基帥氣的形象在台擁有不少死忠粉絲，問到是否有特別的保養祕訣，他說：「其實我沒有什麼特別的皮膚管理方法，但根據角色會有所不同，像這次的角色，就真的完全沒有管理。」希望藉此呈現出瀟灑Man味的一面。李裕英在旁虧他說：「是沒用保養品，反而變更帥的意思嗎？」天生高顏值連女主角都讚嘆。

提到兩人之間擦出的火花，李民基笑認彼此默契十足：「就算只講一兩句話，也能懂對方想表達的意思。」李裕英則說，劇情前半段兩人沒有太多互動，「不過民基哥聊天很能呼應我演戲的節奏。」
