The special will feature appearances from Lana Del Rey, Kendall Jenner, Camila Cabello, Zooey Deschanel, Fred Armisen, Leon Bridges, Troye Sivan, James Corden and the Radio City Rockettes.

      <p>Musgraves is no stranger to Christmas music: She put out <i>A Very Kacey Christmas</i> a few years ago, which included some holiday originals that are actually pretty good! (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnpDdIOTDhE">Ribbons And Bows</a>” in particular goes off.) A lot of the songs featured in the Christmas special are also on that album.</p>
      <p>“I can say without a doubt that this project is unlike anything I’ve ever done before,” Musgraves said in a statement (via <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8542514/kacey-musgraves-christmas-special-amazon-prime">Billboard</a></i>), continuing:</p>
      <blockquote>What started as the small seed of an idea one night over a year ago has turned into something I’m so proud of. Some truly brilliant comedic and musical guests are featured in the show — as well as my own Grandma. My vision was to bring my old Christmas album to life visually and create a modern and fashionable, fresh take on a classic format. It’s a nostalgic, Wes Anderson-inspired reimagining of the holidays. It’s heartfelt, funny, and most of all, real. I can’t wait to finally share.</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</i> will also have an official soundtrack that’ll be out on 11/29, as well. Check out the tracklist for that and a teaser for the show below.</p>
