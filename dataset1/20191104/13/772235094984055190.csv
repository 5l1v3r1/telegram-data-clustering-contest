When we’re not creating it ourselves, the CarAdvice team spends a lot of time finding and consuming motoring content from all over the world.
Here’s a handful of the articles, videos and social media posts that most caught our eye last week. Some of them are brand-new, others have been online for a while.
Enjoy them – just not too much, okay?




CC Editorial: Infiniti – What They’re Doing Right, What They’re Doing Wrong - William Stopford, Curbside Classic
It’s hard not to compare Infiniti’s commercial success with Lexus’s, seeing as they are both Japanese luxury brands initially aimed squarely at the North American market and which both arrived there in late 1989.


The company has struggled in Australia






MX-5 30th Anniversary vs. Porsche Boxster (981) - Dan Trent, PistonHeads
PistonHeads law states that within the first 10 forum comments after a new car review someone will pipe up ""How much? You could have a used whatever for that!""


Which way would you go?






Chasing a Lamborghini Huracán Evo With a 200-MPH Ducati for 1200 Miles - Brendan McAleer & Blake Dragesku, Road&Track
Placing a careful palm on the car’s serpent-like nose, I shut my own meager luggage in the tiny front compartment of a 2020 Lamborghini Huracán Evo and take a step back. The car is a wedge of origami in eye-scorching arancio to match Wallace’s first low-slung Italian. It sits next to a Ducati Panigale V4 S, two icons of coiled Italian potential with nothing in their way.


Italian stallions






£1000 Luxury Car VS £100,000 Luxury Car! - Car Throttle, YouTube
This week, Alex and Ethan compare their £990 Mercedes S500 aka Mega Spec against a brand new £100,000 S-Class.
