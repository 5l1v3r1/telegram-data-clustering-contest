      <p>Following their first World Series win in franchise history, the Washington Nationals will visit the White House and President Donald Trump on Monday.</p>
      <p>While most team members are expected to be in attendance, some were "wrestling with the decision," according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/01/sean-doolittle-declining-white-house-invite-i-dont-want-hang-out-with-somebody-who-talks-like-that/">Washington Post.</a> Relief pitcher Sean Doolittle is the only National who has confirmed that he will not be attending.</p>
      <p>While White House visits for championship sports teams became commonplace in the past few decades, the ceremonies have become political lightning rods in recent years â€” especially since Trump took office.</p>
      <p>Following the Philadelphia Eagles' 2018 Super Bowl win, Trump canceled the visit hours before its scheduled start time and instead held a ceremony in the Rose Garden in which the national anthem was played.</p>
      <p>No NBA team that has won the NBA Finals since Trump took office has been invited to the White House.</p>
      <p>Trump has taken to serving fast food to some sports champions, particularly NCAA football and basketball champions. The spreads often are a hit among college athletes.</p>
      <p>Following the Boston Bruins' Stanley Cup championship in 2011, goalie Tim Thomas chose not to accept then-President Barack Obama's White House invitation to visit the White House, citing political differences.</p>
