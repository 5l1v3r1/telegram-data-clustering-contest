      <p>The influencer and founder of We Wore What partnered with Joe’s for its first influencer collaboration in March. The collection, which unveiled a new style named after Bernstein, contributed to Joe’s single biggest online sales day, driving 88 percent new customers to the web site.</p>
      <p>The pair is reuniting for a second collaboration, with double the inventory of the first. The drop, which goes live Nov. 4, includes a new style, called “The Danielle High Rise Skinny Zip.”</p>

      <p>“Danielle has been unbelievable for our team to work with,” said Jennifer Stender Hawkins, senior vice president of marketing and innovation at Joe’s Jeans, via e-mail. “We know it’s important to keep seeking out partnerships that work for our brand and also make sense for the influencer, celebrity or athlete. The magic works when it’s a true win-win for both parties who are authentically engaged in the process.”</p>
      <p>As part of the partnership, Joe’s and Bernstein will try out <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/technology/instagram-shopping-native-checkout-1203087618/">Instagram’s Checkout</a> and Reminders features, the latter of which allows brands and creators to alert their followers to new releases. Joe’s will also unveil a collaboration with football player Julian Edelman of the New England Patriots, and will test out the Instagram features for that partnership, too.</p>
      <p>Bernstein has a track record of successful collaborations. She has released four collections with swimwear brand Onia, the latest of which raked in $1 million in the first three hours.</p>
      <p>In August, Bernstein and Onia announced a licensing deal that made Onia the official production partner for Bernstein’s Shop We Wore What, which houses her line of overalls and future fashion collections.</p>
