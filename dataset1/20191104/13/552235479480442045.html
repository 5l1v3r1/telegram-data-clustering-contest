      <p>A prisoner who repeatedly slashed a notorious gangland hitman has been jailed for five years.</p>
      <p>Paul Shields, 33, struck 57-year-old Raymond Anderson’s head and neck with a razor blade in a hall at HMP Shotts in Lanarkshire, on August 22 2018.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">High Court in Edinburgh</a> heard that Shields attacked the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/300-gang-members-linked-lyons-20798261">gangland</a> killer after hearing rumours from fellow inmates about how Anderson wanted to assault him. </p>
      <p>The man Shields attacked was once handed the longest prison sentence in Scottish legal history. </p>
      <p>He and his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-gang-lyons-heroin-prison-11572687">co-accused James McDonald</a>, 44, were both jailed for a minimum of 35 years for murdering Michael Lyons,21, at the Applerow Motors garage in Lambhill, Glasgow, on December 6 2006. </p>
      <p>The pair also shot their victim’s cousin Steven Lyons and notorious Paisley based gangster Robert Pickett during the attack.</p>

      <p>Passing sentence on that occasion, judge Lord Hardie described the attack as a “cold blooded, premeditated execution”.</p>
      <p>On Monday, judge Lord Kinclaven heard how Shields had developed mental health problems in the weeks running up to the attack. </p>
      <p>Defence advocate Drew McKenzie said his condition made him determined to confront Anderson. </p>
      <p>However, Lord Kinclaven imposed an extended sentence on Shields. As well as serving a five year prison sentence, Shields will be supervised by the authorities for three years following his release from custody. </p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Lord Kinclaven said: “I have taken everything which has been said by Mr McKenzie into account. I have taken into account your mental health issues and I have taken into account that your have encountered problems throughout your life.</p>
      <p>“I have also taken into account that you were fearful in the time leading up to the attack.  </p>
      <p>“However, you have pleaded guilty to a very serious offence. Rather than inform the prison authorities about your fears, you chose to procure a weapon and assault the complainer. </p>
      <p>“There is no alternative to the imposition of a custodial sentence. There is no other way of dealing with you.”</p>
      <p>Shields, of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, initially appeared in court last month. Sentence had been deferred for the court to obtain reports. </p>
      <p>On that occasion, prosecutors played CCTV footage of the attack.</p>

      <p>The judge could see Shields, who was serving a four and a half year stretch for assault and robbery, sneaking up behind Anderson and lashing out at him.</p>
      <p>Anderson could be seen then chasing after Shields with prison officers in hot pursuit. </p>
      <p>Shields was then caught. Anderson, of Glasgow, was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment. </p>
      <p>Shields’s then counsel George Gebbie told Lord Kinclaven that his client carried out the attack because he was “anxious”. </p>
      <p>He added: “Mr Shields had heard rumours that Mr Anderson was planning to commit acts of physical violence against him. </p>
      <p>“In a heightened state of anxiety, Mr Shields decided to carry out an attack of his own on Mr Anderson.”</p>
      <p>Shields, originally of Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting Anderson to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement by repeatedly striking him on the head, body and neck with a razor. </p>
      <p>Prosecution lawyer Margaret Barron told the court that that Shields, who is currently at HMP Low Moss in Bishopbriggs, Dunbartonshire, has 11 previous convictions for violence.</p>

      <p>Ms Barron also told the court that Anderson was taken to hospital in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, for treatment. </p>
      <p>Ms Barron said: “As a result of the assault, the complainer sustained the following injuries; a 20 centimetre laceration from his right neck to the corner of his right eye. The wound was debrided and sutures inserted. </p>
      <p>“He also sustained a nine centimetre laceration on the left scalp down to his forehead which was cleaned and did not require sutures. </p>
      <p>“He also sustained a five centimetre laceration behind his left ear. The wound was also debrided and sutures inserted. </p>
      <p>“He is permanently scarred as a result of sustaining these injuries.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Shield’s current advocate Drew McKenzie said his client had became “paranoid” in the weeks leading up to the attack. </p>
      <p>Mr McKenzie added: “He has suffered from mental health problems. He became paranoid that he was going to fall victim to an attack and decided to take the matter into his own hands.”</p>
