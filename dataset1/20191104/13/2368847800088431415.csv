【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】金曲歌后莫文蔚最後一場大型巡演「絕色25周年世界巡迴演唱會」，將於12月登上台北小巨蛋，而為此，她4日也出席訪台的唯一通告——《綜藝大熱門》宣傳。

她感性地表示：「會不捨得，現在真的要進入尾聲了，我是覺得作為一個表演者，永遠在舞台上面是最好的狀態，把最好的自己帶給大家，所以要在最好的時候退下。」
未來是否會把重心多放在家庭上面？莫文蔚笑著表示：「對！巡演結束之後把時間還給老公，可能先回去意大利，不能坐在那邊不工作，後面要做音樂劇也要很多的時間。」
她表示，過去10年都忙於出專輯跟巡演演唱會，期待人生下半場可以嘗試沒做過的事情，「我不是要退休，是想換個形式，後面想做歌舞劇。」帶給大中華市場真正屬於自己的百老匯。
費玉清（小哥）本週唱完最終場後將退休，莫文蔚惋惜地表示：「他就是在我心目中永遠的天籟之聲，我其實這個巡演，去年的時候有希望他來當嘉賓，但他沒辦法過來，他以後不唱歌真的很難想像，但我絕對理解，也尊重他的想法。」

談及最後一次大型巡迴，莫文蔚透露台北場要挑戰兩天演唱截然不同的曲目。先前赴西藏拉薩演出，同時創下最高海拔大型演唱會的金氏世界紀錄認證，她興奮地說自己沒有高原反應，「我很嗨、很興奮，越唱越有勁，比在平地上還有力氣，神給我一個力量讓我去完成。」感謝整個團隊齊心、拼命，為華人爭光，才能完成這個創舉。
主持人吳宗憲親自揮毫題字，祝福她票房火爆，誇她的聲音特色至今還沒有人可以超越，最喜愛她的歌是《陰天》、《廣島之戀》，到KTV必點，交女友也很適合對唱情歌。他還打趣說想拍《雞姊外傳》，想請莫文蔚來演出，逗得莫文蔚笑不停。
