      <h1>Meghan McCain Goes Toe-to-Toe With Cory Booker’s Campaign in Nasty Twitter Spat: You’re ‘Polling in 11th’</h1>

      <p><a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/meghan-mccain/"><b>Meghan McCain</b></a> let her Twitter fingers fly following <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/10/31/folks-call-for-meghan-mccains-removal-after-rude-spoiled-brat-behavior-toward-cory-booker-and-sunny-hostin-in-the-same-segment-she-has-to-go/">a tense exchange</a> with presidential hopeful and “<a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/the-view/"><b>View</b></a>” guest host<b><a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/cory-booker/"> Sen. Cory Booker</a> </b>(D- N.J.) last week.</p>
      <p>Booker appeared on the daytime talk show Wednesday and was subjected to a hard line of questioning by McCain, 34, who grilled the senator on his previous support for mandatory gun buybacks — an effort she dismissed as “a left-wing fever dream.”</p>

      <p>“I wanna know how you think you and [former Texas Rep.<b> Beto O’Rourke</b>] are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and can get his AR-15s, because let me tell you — he’s not giving it back,” she said.</p>
      <p>McCain, one of the show’s resident conservatives, slammed O’Rourke’s buyback plan as “crazy,” drawing a rebuke from Booker, who urged her to be mindful of “the way we talk about each other.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” she shot back, later interrupting the candidate’s anecdote on civility to press him further on “how you’re going to get my brother’s [AR-15] back.”</p>
      <p>Booker’s efforts to rise above the bilge didn’t go unnoticed. However, their feud spilled over into the Twittersphere, where McCain continued taking jabs at the New Jersey Democrat after being called out by one of his campaign staffers.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Booker campaign manager <b>Addisu Demissie</b> wrote: “Not sure what @MeghanMcCain was trying to accomplish with this question but @CoryBooker as usual handled it with grace, class and substance.”</p>

      <p>“You’re Cory Booker’s campaign manager,” McCain fired back. “I asked a specific policy question — he says he’s the most direct candidate and I’ll [sic] I got was a dodge.”</p>
      <p>The Fox News alum later added that “At least Beto [O’Rourke] is honest about the fact that he wants to take our guns away.”</p>
      <p><b>Sean Dowdy,</b> a deputy political director for Booker, also jumped into the mix and praised the 2020 hopeful for his handling of the incident.</p>
      <p>“More praise for @CoryBooker on the @MeghanMcCain exchange,” Dowdy wrote, tagging McCain directly.</p>
      <p>The right-wing pundit didn’t take long to react.</p>

      <p>“Cory Bookers deputy political director apparently has nothing better to do with his time than this,” she wrote in a scathing tweet. “Maybe if you spent less time on Twitter he wouldn’t be polling in 11th?”</p>
