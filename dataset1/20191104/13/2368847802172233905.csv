范冰冰高雲翔合拍劇換角重拍 確定新角已進組

04 Nov 2019, 13:38

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】早前由范冰冰和高雲翔合拍的電視劇《贏天下》（又名《巴清傳》），現已換角重拍， 確定新角色已經進組。據早前報導，換角原因一則因去年4月原男主高雲翔在澳洲拍另一部戲時涉性侵被捕，隨後，原女主角范冰冰也捲入逃稅風波，導致作品迄今尚未播出。「唐德影視」為挽回慘重損失，遂決定重拍。
據陸媒報導，「唐德影視」投資5億（人民幣，下同）的66集電視劇《贏天下》，分別在2016年10月和2017年11月將該劇的網絡播映權和電視台播映權授予了優酷、上海東方衛視和江蘇衛視，合計價格為9.55億元，使該劇成為版權價格最高的電視劇之一。
報導指，雖然該劇早已完成拍攝和製作，但由於多種原因，迄今尚未播出。
一是該劇在先前公布預告片時，就有研究先秦歷史的學者痛批並舉報該劇篡改歷史、對歷史人物進行抹黑、存在過分的血腥與色情情節。
在經過「整改」之後，該劇劇名從《巴清傳》改成了《贏天下》。
等到還未來得及播出，劇中的男一號高雲翔便在澳洲涉性侵，當時劇方啟用范冰冰的前男友李晨替代了高雲翔的角色，進行了重新拍攝。李晨當時為愛救場，與范冰冰分飾男女一號。
補拍完畢後，似乎「萬事俱備，只欠開播」，但在這期間范冰冰又出事了。2018年5月，范冰冰被央視前主持人崔永元踢爆簽訂「陰陽合同」，涉偷稅漏稅，遭到當局調查，以至於引發大陸演藝圈大地震，該劇的播出再次擱淺。
上月初，「唐德影視」發布公告，《贏天下》將於12月31日之前完成重拍，整體花費將超6,000萬元，主要通過技術手段來換鏡頭，作品將於年底完成製作。
此次《關於簽署重大合同補充協議的公告》中明確寫道，范冰冰和高雲翔因此前的「劣跡」，在劇中的鏡頭全部被替換，具體由另行指定的兩位「一線演員」頂替。至於到底是哪兩位「一線演員」，協議中並未公布。
此前有知情人士透露，「唐德影視」正在與出演過多部古裝劇的女星唐嫣接洽，希望她來頂替范冰冰出演「巴清」。但是，且不說現在唐嫣懷著身孕，能否出演還未可知，即便是出演恐怕也會引起不必要的爭議。之後有媒體聯繫到唐嫣團隊，其經紀人稱：「我們沒有接觸過這個項目。」
據騰訊網披露，《贏天下》的拍攝目前已經啟動，64歲的張國立已經進組拍攝。
消息源自大陸女星佟麗婭的舞台劇《在遠方在這裡》將11月9日至10日演出，目前還有不到一週的時間，11月2日，官方晒出了眾星為佟麗婭宣傳的視頻畫面，包括胡歌、謝娜、張國立在內的演員都為她送上了祝福。
其中張國立穿的是秦朝的戲服，與此前曝光的《贏天下》劇照的造型一模一樣，證明張國立已投入《贏天下》劇組開始拍攝。
據悉，張國立在劇中扮演的是「呂不韋」，與范冰冰有很多對手戲。此番范冰冰和高雲翔需要換角重拍，張國立自然也需要配合重演。
只是此次，頂替范冰冰和高雲翔的一線演員還未公開，這也是目前觀眾所關心的問題，現在傳出，「巴清」一角將由陳喬恩來出演。
據《上海證券報》報導，2015年2月在大陸創業板掛牌上市的「唐德影視」，股價從2018年一季度的22.97元/股最高價，一直跌到2019年初的5.71元/股，跌幅達到驚人的75.14%。股票下挫期間，多位股東陸續離開「唐德影視」。
而且，「唐德影視」僅因《贏天下》一直播出無望，也嚴重影響了2018年的業績。據今年5月份公布的年報數據顯示，「唐德影視」2018年淨虧損9.27億元，營業收入同比減少68.52%，這也是該公司上市以來首次出現虧損。
有分析指，深度綁定知名演員的「唐德影視」，雖然現在換角重拍《贏天下》，但由於受中國經濟下滑、電視劇本身的題材以及觀眾心理等多重因素的影響，且不說該劇盈利，對收回投資也存疑。

Fan Bingbing Gao Yunxiang co-produced the drama for re-shooting, confirming that the new corner has entered the group.

04 Nov 2019, 13:38

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The TV series ""Winning the World"" (also known as ""Ba Qing Chuan""), which was co-produced by Fan Bingbing and Gao Yunxiang earlier, has been re-shooted and confirmed that the new role has been entered. According to earlier reports, the reason for the change of the corner was due to the sexual assault on the former male lord Gao Yunxiang in Australia in April last year. Later, the original actress Fan Bingbing was also involved in the tax evasion, resulting in the work has not yet been broadcast. In order to recover the heavy losses, ""Donde Film and Television"" decided to remake.
According to the Lu Media report, ""Tangde Film and Television"" invested 500 million (RMB, the same below) 66 episodes of the TV series ""Win the World"", in October 2016 and November 2017 respectively, the drama's network broadcast rights and TV broadcast rights It was awarded to Youku, Shanghai Oriental TV and Jiangsu Satellite TV for a total price of 955 million yuan, making the show one of the most copyrighted TV dramas.
The report said that although the show has already been filmed and produced, it has not been broadcast so far for a variety of reasons.
First, when the show was previously published in the trailer, scholars who studied the history of the pre-Qin had painstakingly approved and reported the history of the drama, smearing the historical figures, and excessive bloody and erotic plots.
After the ""reform"", the name of the play was changed from ""Ba Qing Chuan"" to ""Win the World.""
When it was time to broadcast in the future, the male No. 1 Gao Yunxiang in the play was sexually assaulted in Australia. At that time, Fan Chen, the former boyfriend of Fan Bingbing, replaced Gao Yunxiang’s role and re-shooted. Li Chen was at the time to save the field, and Fan Bingbing decorated the men and women.
After the re-shooting, it seems that ""everything is ready, only owe to the broadcast"", but during this period Fan Bingbing has an accident. In May 2018, Fan Bingbing was kicked out by the former CCTV host Cui Yongyuan to sign a ""Yin and Yang Contract"", which involved tax evasion and tax evasion. It was investigated by the authorities, which led to a major earthquake in the mainland entertainment industry. The broadcast of the show was once again stranded.
At the beginning of last month, ""Tangde Film and Television"" announced that ""Winning the World"" will complete the remake before December 31, the overall cost will exceed 60 million yuan, mainly through technical means to change the lens, the work will be completed by the end of the year.
The ""Announcement on Signing a Major Contract Supplemental Agreement"" clearly stated that Fan Bingbing and Gao Yunxiang's ""missing traces"" in the previous section were all replaced in the drama, and were replaced by two other ""first-line actors"" designated separately. As for the two ""first-line actors"", the agreement has not been announced.
Earlier, a person familiar with the matter said that ""Donde Film and Television"" was in contact with Tang Hao, who starred in many costume dramas, and hoped that she would replace Fan Bingbing in ""Ba Qing"". However, it is not known whether Tang Yan is pregnant or not. Even if he is acting, it may cause unnecessary controversy. Afterwards, some media contacted the Tang Yi team. The agent said: ""We have not been exposed to this project.""
According to Tencent.com, the filming of ""Win the World"" has been launched. The 64-year-old Zhang Guoli has already taken the film.
The news came from the mainland actress Julia's stage play ""Here in the Distance"", which will be performed from November 9th to 10th. There is still less than a week. On November 2nd, the official has released a video of the stars promoting for Liya. The pictures, including Hu Ge, Xie Na, Zhang Guoli, gave her a blessing.
Among them, Zhang Guoli wore the costumes of the Qin Dynasty, which was exactly the same as the previous ""Winning the World"" stills. It proved that Zhang Guoli had already entered the ""Winning the World"" crew to start shooting.
It is reported that Zhang Guoli played ""Lv Weiwei"" in the play, and Fan Bingbing has many opponents. This time Fan Bingbing and Gao Yunxiang need to re-shoot the angle, Zhang Guoli naturally needs to repeat the replay.
Only this time, the first-line actors who replaced Fan Bingbing and Gao Yunxiang have not been made public. This is also the issue that the audience is concerned about. Now it is said that the corner of ""Ba Qing"" will be starred by Chen Qiaoen.
According to the Shanghai Securities News, the ""Tangde Film and Television"" listed on the mainland GEM in February 2015, the stock price has fallen from the highest price of 22.97 yuan / share in the first quarter of 2018 to 5.71 yuan / share in the beginning of 2019. The decline reached an astonishing 75.14%. During the stock fall, many shareholders left the ""Tangde Film and Television"" one after another.
Moreover, ""Tangde Film and Television"" was only hopeless because of the live broadcast of ""Winning the World"", which also seriously affected the performance in 2018. According to the annual report data released in May this year, ""Tangde Film and Television"" had a net loss of 927 million yuan in 2018, and its operating income decreased by 68.52% year-on-year. This is the first time that the company has suffered losses since its listing.
Some analysts pointed out that the ""Dangde Film and Television"", which is deeply bound to famous actors, is now remake of ""Winning the World"", but it is affected by many factors such as the Chinese economic downturn, the theme of the TV series itself and the audience psychology. The show’s profitability is also doubtful about the recovery of investment.
