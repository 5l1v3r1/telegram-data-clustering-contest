      <p>The Mann Packaging Co. is <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.us/">voluntarily recalling</a> more than 100 vegetable products sold in the United States and Canada for possible listeria contamination.</p>
      <p>The recall is in response to a notification by the Food and Drug Administration and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for a potential contamination of listeria monocytogenes.</p>
      <p>The packages have a "Best If Enjoyed By" date of October 11, 2019, to November 16, 2019. The packaged vegetables were sold under a variety of brand names, including Mann's, HEB, Del Monte, Hungryroot, Marketside, O Organics, Signature Farms, Sysco and Trader Joe's.</p>
      <p>A full list and images for products in the United States can be <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.us/">found here</a> , while the full list for Canada can be <a href="https://mannpackingproductlist11-2019.ca/">found here</a> .</p>
      <p>There have been no reported illnesses associated with these products to date, according to the company.</p>
      <p>Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacteria that can cause listeriosis. Listeriosis can cause fevers, headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea in healthy individuals.</p>
      <p>However, the infection can be fatal for some people. Pregnant women and their newborns, adults over the age of 65 and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> .</p>
      <p>An estimated 1,600 people are infected by listeriosis every year and approximately 260 die, according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>Mann Packaging says customers should throw out any affected products. If customers have any questions, they should call the company at 1-844-927-0707 or email the company at consumers@mannpacking.com.</p>
