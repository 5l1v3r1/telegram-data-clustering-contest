1. 夾公仔生意做得過？
龔sir，請問你覺得夾公仔生意如何？租機做台主做得過嗎？

龔成老師：

這的確是一個潮流，但最大的問題，是香港人極貪新鮮。
我相信這刻有錢賺，但香港人一向變得好快，你不能夠預期有長期的現金流，加上現時競爭者多，故我對這類投資有保留。
2. 止蝕是重要一課！
老師，我最近將你所講的劣質股止蝕了，蝕錢真的十分心痛！

龔成老師：

每個成功的投資者，都一定會經歷！止蝕是重要一步，如果你能夠從中學習，之後一定可以賺得返！
3. 問銀行借P loan買股票？
老師你好 ! 我想問在甚麼情況下，才會問銀行借P loan買股票？我記得你之前有文章曾提及，可否再詳細說明？

龔成老師：

當股市在恐慌期，又或在計算企業價值時，已到達一個便宜區，而你手上資金又用盡時，可以出「最後一張皇牌」—借錢買股。
我過往曾做過一次，就是在2008年金融海嘯時，股市恐慌，大市個個看淡，而我已經每月一出糧就掃貨，用盡了手上所有現金，最後就借私人貸款買股。由於這是「最後一張皇牌」，所以，一定要在大恐慌、大股災時才出手。
4. daytrade賺幾千到萬元？
老師，我見有人daytrade十分成功！每日賺數千到萬元都有，令我極為心動，想以此為目標，成為一個股票交易員 。

龔成老師：

我希望你「證實」這人真的賺錢，根據我過往10年做銀行及證券行的經驗，我見到daytrade的人，都是中短期有賺，但最後輸翻晒的。
我過往有個客，有數千萬身家，炒到上十億元，最後倒欠銀行錢。很多事情，當一凡風順時，看似容易賺錢，但到逆轉時，就會全部無晒。最大的問題是，投資市場久不久，就會出現一些突發事件。
5. 月儲15K的投資策略！
老師你好，本人現時25歲，如果不想月供股票，而每月能儲約15,000元，如何能在10年內把投資最大化？

龔成老師：

首先，我會分析現時的股市屬便宜還是昂貴，以現時的水平，大約是合理區。所以，你在財富分配上，最好是部分持有股票，部分持有現金。你每月儲到的資金，亦可以作出類似的分配。每月儲8,000元去「準備買入」的部分，餘下$7,000儲去「待便宜價才入」的部分。
然後，你要鎖定目標的投資股票，以你的年齡，可以投資盈富（2800）、恆基（0012）、銀娛（0027）、港鐵（0066），以及小注比亞迪（1211）。
下一步，當你「準備買入」的部分，儲夠足夠入一手上述股票的資金時，就直接買入。當然，到時要再分析股票情況，決定買入的先後次序。至於餘下的$7,000儲至「待便宜價才入」的部分，這樣就能不斷儲錢，同時等便宜價才投資。

Ask the bank to borrow P loan to buy stocks? Borrowing money to buy shares to take a chance to shoot | Gong Chengxin box
04 Nov 2019, 13:44 by Gong Cheng
Many readers are new to investment, and have doubts about stock selection, monthly stocks and investment mentality. See what Mr. Gong Cheng has any suggestions!

1. Have you ever done a business with a doll?
Gong sir, what do you think of the business of the clip doll? Have you rented a machine to do it?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

This is indeed a trend, but the biggest problem is that Hong Kong people are extremely greedy.
I believe that there are money earned at this moment, but Hong Kong people have always become very fast. You cannot expect long-term cash flow. In addition, there are many competitors now, so I have reservations about such investments.
2. Stop loss is an important lesson!
Teacher, I recently stopped the inferior stocks you talked about, and it is really heartbreaking to grieve money!

Teacher Gong Cheng:

Every successful investor will definitely experience it! Stop loss is an important step. If you can learn from it, you can earn it later!
3. Ask the bank to borrow P loan to buy stocks?
Hello teacher! I want to ask under what circumstances, will I ask the bank to borrow P loan to buy stocks? I remember that you mentioned in an article before, can you elaborate?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

When the stock market is in a panic period, or when calculating the value of the company, it has reached a cheap area, and when you run out of funds, you can make the ""last ace"" - borrow money to buy shares.
I have done it once in the past, when the financial tsunami in 2008, the stock market panic, the market is bearish, and I have already sold the goods every month, exhausted all the cash in hand, and finally borrowed a private loan. share. Since this is the ""last ace"", it must be shot in the event of panic and panic.
4. How does daytrade earn thousands to 10,000 yuan?
Teacher, I saw someone daytrade very successful! I earned thousands to tens of thousands of dollars a day, which made me extremely excited and wanted to be a stock trader.

Teacher Gong Cheng:

I hope that you ""confirm"" that this person is really making money. According to my experience in banking and securities trading in the past 10 years, the people I met on daytrade are earning in the short to medium term, but in the end they lost their money.
I used to have a guest, tens of millions of net worth, and spent a billion yuan, and finally owed money to the bank. A lot of things, when it comes to being smooth, it seems easy to make money, but when it comes to reversal, it will be completely untouched. The biggest problem is that there will be some unexpected events in the investment market.
5. Monthly storage 15K investment strategy!
Hello teacher, I am 25 years old. If I don’t want to pay for stocks every month, and I can save about 15,000 yuan a month, how can I maximize my investment in 10 years?

Teacher Gong Cheng:

First of all, I will analyze whether the current stock market is cheap or expensive. At the current level, it is about a reasonable area. Therefore, in the distribution of wealth, it is best to hold some shares and some to hold cash. A similar allocation can be made for the funds you save each month. Save 8,000 yuan a month to the ""Ready to Buy"" section, and the remaining $7,000 to go to the ""Purchase price to enter"" section.
Then, you need to target the investment stocks of your target. At your age, you can invest in Yingfu (2800), Henderson (0012), Galaxy (0027), MTR (0066), and small note BYD (1211).
Next, when you are ""ready to buy"", you can buy directly if you have enough funds to get into the stock. Of course, it is time to analyze the stock situation and decide the order of purchase. As for the remaining $7,000 to be stored in the ""waiting for a cheaper price"" section, you can continue to save money while investing at cheap prices.
