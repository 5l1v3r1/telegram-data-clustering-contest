小丑現身全球示威 學者：社會底層向當權者示警

（中央社華盛頓4日綜合外電報導）全球各大城市街頭的抗議人海中，引人注目的是一張白皙、帶有令人毛骨悚然紅脣笑容的小丑臉龐。學者指出，示威者扮小丑的其中一個原因是要向當權者釋出來自社會底層的警告。
黎巴嫩和伊拉克的藝術家在海報上繪出小丑，或是透過社群媒體分享小丑的合成圖。有人還在智利首都聖地牙哥（Santiago）的雕像上噴漆，寫上「我們都是小丑」的字樣。
在香港，反送中抗議群眾扮成小丑作為示威行動的一部分，反抗港府發布禁止在公共場合配戴面具或口罩的禁蒙面法。
他們有著不同的目標，有著不同的不滿，例如撙節措施、民主自由受到威脅、一般老百姓和執政菁英之間不平等加劇等。
但為何黎巴嫩、伊拉克、智利、玻利維亞、香港和西班牙的部分示威者，會從一部具爭議電影中的患精神病殺手受到啟發呢？
這部讓觀眾為小丑掬一把同情之淚的電影具有警世作用，描述忽視社會最弱勢族群將導致可怕後果。
德國哈雷威田堡馬丁路德大學（Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg）霍夫學院（HoF-Institute）研究員比爾（Andreas Beer）表示，向當權者釋出訊息是抗議者扮成小丑的原因之一。比爾先前寫過關於抗爭中使用面具的文章。






比爾告訴美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）：「基本上，在示威行動中化妝成小丑或戴上小丑面具，是在向香港或黎巴嫩政府傳達『我正處在（社會）最底層，注意你接下來要做的事』。」
比爾說，扮成小丑角色也是示威者讓自己被看到、被聽到的有效方式。由於這部電影受到世界各地觀眾的歡迎，透過意象或是提及「小丑」，都可以幫助示威者吸引目光並獲得更廣泛的支持。
儘管小丑在先前數部電影中被描述為暴力和破壞的形象，但28歲的平面設計藝術總監阿布喬德（Cynthia Aboujaoude）說，這並非她所認同的小丑。
黎巴嫩街頭藝術家卡巴尼（Mohamed Kabbani）的海報作品秀出小丑拿著汽油彈的圖像，他說他的藝術僅是一種表達的形式。
卡巴尼表示：「當我說『佔領街頭』時，絕對不是暴力行為。我們在黎巴嫩的抗爭全是和平與和諧的。言語的力量比槍枝更強大。」（譯者：吳昇鴻/核稿：陳昱婷）1081104

The clown appeared in a global demonstration. Scholar: The bottom of the society warns the authorities.

(Central News Agency, Washington, DC, 4th) The protesters on the streets of major cities around the world are striking a white face with a clowny face with a creepy red lips. Scholars pointed out that one of the reasons for demonstrators to be clowns is to release warnings from the bottom of society to those in power.
Artists in Lebanon and Iraq paint clowns on posters or share a composite picture of clowns through social media. Someone painted paint on the statue of Santiago, the capital of Chile, and wrote the words ""We are all clowns.""
In Hong Kong, in the anti-delivery, the protesters dressed up as clowns as part of the demonstrations and resisted the Hong Kong government's ban on masking masks or masks in public.
They have different goals and different dissatisfaction, such as measures of chastity, threats to democracy and freedom, and increased inequality between ordinary people and ruling elites.
But why are some demonstrators in Lebanon, Iraq, Chile, Bolivia, Hong Kong and Spain inspired by a psychiatric killer in a controversial film?
This film, which allows the audience to shed a tear of sympathy for the clown, has a warning effect, describing the neglect of the most vulnerable groups in society will lead to terrible consequences.
Andreas Beer, a researcher at HoF-Institute at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, said that releasing information to those in power is one of the reasons why protesters dressed up as clowns. . Bill previously wrote an article about the use of masks in the fight.






Bill told CNN: ""Basically, in the demonstration, make up a clown or put on a clown mask, is to convey to the Hong Kong or Lebanese government ""I am at the bottom of the (social), pay attention to you What to do next.""
Bill said that being a clown character is also an effective way for demonstrators to see and be heard. Since the film is popular with audiences around the world, the imagery or the mention of the ""clown"" can help the demonstrators to attract attention and gain wider support.
Although the clown has been described as violent and destructive in previous films, Cynthia Aboujaoude, 28-year-old graphic design art director, said that this is not the clown she agrees with.
The poster of Lebanese street artist Mohamed Kabbani shows an image of a clown holding a petrol bomb. He said his art is only a form of expression.
Kabani said: ""When I say ""occupying the streets"", it is definitely not a violent act. Our struggle in Lebanon is all peaceful and harmonious. The power of speech is stronger than the gun."" (Translator: Wu Shenghong / Appropriation: Chen Yuting) 1081104
