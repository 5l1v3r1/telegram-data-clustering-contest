Whistleblower Will Answer Questions, Attorney Says
04 Nov 2019, 13:27 by ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON (AP) — The whistleblower who raised alarms about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine and touched off the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry is willing to answer written questions submitted by House Republicans, the person’s lawyer says.
The offer made over the weekend to Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the intelligence committee, was aimed in part at fending off attacks by Trump and his Republican allies who are demanding the whistleblower’s identity be revealed.
It would allow Republicans to ask questions of the whistleblower without having to go through the committee’s chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.
“Being a whistleblower is not a partisan job nor is impeachment an objective. That is not our role,” Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s attorney, tweeted Sunday.
“We will ensure timely answers,” he said.
Zaid said the whistleblower would answer questions directly from Republican members “in writing, under oath & penalty of perjury.” Only queries seeking the person’s identity will not be answered, he said.
Nunes’ office did not have immediate comment.
The surprise proposal comes as Trump stepped up attacks on the whistleblower, tweeting Sunday that the person “must come forward.” The whistleblower raised concerns about Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he pressed Zelensky to investigate Trump’s political rivals.
The whistleblower’s account of the call has been providing a road map for House Democrats investigating whether Trump and others in his orbit pressured Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
The House is heading into a crucial phase of its impeachment inquiry as it aims to move toward public impeachment hearings this month. For the coming week they have called 11 witnesses, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former national security adviser John Bolton for closed-door interviews. It’s unclear whether any of them will come to Capitol Hill.
“Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!” Trump tweeted Sunday.
He also pushed the news media to divulge the whistleblower’s identity, claiming that the person’s accounting of events is incorrect. The whistleblower’s complaint has been corroborated by people with firsthand knowledge of the events who have appeared on Capitol Hill.
“They know who it is. You know who it is. You just don’t want to report it,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “And you know you’d be doing the public a service if you did.”
U.S. whistleblower laws exist to protect the identity and careers of people who bring forward accusations of wrongdoing by government officials. Lawmakers in both parties have historically backed those protections.
The Associated Press typically does not reveal the identity of whistleblowers.
The whistleblower has become a central fixation for Republicans, particularly the president. Republicans view a political opportunity in unmasking the CIA official, whom the intelligence community’s inspector general said could have “arguable political bias.” The inspector general nevertheless found the whistleblower’s complaint to be “credible.”
Trump believes that if he can expose bias in the initial allegations against him, he can paint the entire impeachment inquiry as a partisan, political probe. Republicans have largely fought the impeachment inquiry on process, not substance, saying it is tainted because interviews were conducted in closed sessions — ignoring the fact that Republican lawmakers were in attendance — and complaining that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had not called a vote to launch the matter.
But Pelosi did call such a vote last week and the inquiry will soon shift into open hearings. Now Trump is demanding that his allies defend his actions, insisting that he did nothing wrong and saying that quid pro quos like the one offered Ukraine are common occurrences while leveraging power in conducting foreign policy.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Sunday that he had not discussed the whistleblower’s offer with Nunes, but said the person should answer questions in a public appearance before the committee.
“When you’re talking about the removal of the president of the United States, undoing democracy, undoing what the American public had voted for, I think that individual should come before the committee,” McCarthy told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Zaid said his team had addressed the issue of alleged bias with Republican members of the committee and had stressed the need for anonymity to maintain the safety of the whistleblower and the person’s family, “but with little effect in halting the attacks.”
“Let me be absolutely clear: Our willingness to cooperate has not changed,” tweeted Andrew P. Bakaj, another attorney representing the whistleblower. “What we object to and find offensive, however, is the effort to uncover the identity of the whistleblower.”
Bakaj wrote on Saturday that “their fixation on exposing the whistleblower’s identity is simply because they’re at a loss as to how to address the investigations the underlying disclosure prompted.”
