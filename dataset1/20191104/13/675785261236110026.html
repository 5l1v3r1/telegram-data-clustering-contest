      <p>Ms Agac, who described Ali as a "wonderful boy" said: “They were due to come and fix it this week.</p>
      <p>"When they came, they closed the window but the handle didn’t lock.</p>
      <p>"We want a full investigation.”</p>
      <p>Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called to the scene just before 10am.</p>
      <p>But Ali died in hospital around 90 minutes later.</p>

      <p>She said: “He opened a window, he fell down. The window, it was faulty.</p>
      <p>"For nearly two months she was calling the council just to come to fix it.</p>
      <p>“The handle was not secure. They were coming to fix it, but then this happened.</p>
      <p>"She was crying, she was shocked yesterday. She was complaining about this."</p>
      <p>Meral added: “He was a very nice boy.</p>
      <p>"The mum was looking after the kids brilliantly, she was caring for her children.”</p>
      <p>Zina Etheridge, Haringey Council's chief executive, said: “We are aware of a tragic incident of a young child falling from height in Tottenham, and our deepest sympathies are with the family at this time.</p>
      <p>"The police are currently investigating and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further until more is known.”</p>
      <p>A Met Police spokesman said: "Officers, the London Ambulance Service, London’s Air Ambulance and the London Fire Brigade attended and found the baby boy in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>"The child, believed to be aged 18 months, was taken to a north London hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11.39am.</p>
      <p>"Formal identification and a post-mortem examination will take place in due course."</p>
      <p>He said that no arrests have been made and officers are continuing to investigate.</p>
