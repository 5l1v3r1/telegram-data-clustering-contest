VPN deals: What to look for
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is designed to keep you safe from prying eyes online by offering completely anonymous browsing. Not only will it protect your identity and sensitive information, particularly necessary on public or shared WiFi networks, it can also allow you to access blocked content. This can include BBC iPlayer when you’re travelling outside the UK, as well as Netflix in other regions like the US.
Usually available in the form of three or four different plan options, VPNs are traditionally something you can subscribe to for a month or more, with the more time you commit to reducing the price significantly.
Plans also tend to allow you to use the VPN on more than one device, including a PC, Mac and mobile devices.
Discounts on VPNs can be huge, with savings of more than 50% available from some of our favourite VPN providers from time to time.
We have plenty of content to help you find out everything you need to know about using a VPN. You can take a look at our favourites in our best VPN round-up, find one that'll let you access US Netflix in our round-up of the best Netflix VPNs, or simply find out how to use a VPN here.
