Death Stranding is a Response to Brexit and the Border Wall
04 Nov 2019, 13:06 by Alistair Jones
Hideo Kojima says that Death Stranding is a response to the politics of Trump and Brexit, and an attempt to represent connection over division. Speaking with the BBC during the last days of the game’s development, Kojima said that he hopes his game’s message resonates with people around the world.
During his interview, the developer said that “President Trump right now is building a wall. Then you have Brexit, where the UK is trying to leave the EU, and it feels like there are lots of walls and people thinking only about themselves in the world. In Death Stranding we’re using bridges to represent connection.”
He goes on to say that Death Stranding is an attempt to encourage people to step back from the violence and aggression on social media, and encourage people to “relearn how to be kind to others. I don’t think that’s a message anyone in the world is opposed to.”
