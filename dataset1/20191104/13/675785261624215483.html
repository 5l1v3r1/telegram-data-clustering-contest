      <h2>Real Madrid are ready to test Manchester City's resolve with a big-money bid for one of their best players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:37:17+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Real Madrid are preparing to offer Manchester City £70million plus Gareth Bale to sign Raheem Sterling, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Sterling has progressed to become one of the world's best players over the past few seasons, and Los Blancos have identified his as the man to get them firing again.</p>
      <p>Bale, meanwhile, is largely out of favour under Zinedine Zidane at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid,</a> and a player the club has been trying to get off their books for a few years now.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> are unlikely to want to swap their 24-year-old winger for 30-year-old Bale, who has scored just twice in six La Liga appearances this season.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11854029/raheem-sterling-real-madrid-plan-gareth-bale-70m-bid-for-forward">Sky Sports,</a> Real Madrid are sending scouts to watch Sterling in action for England in their matches against Montenegro and Kosovo next month.</p>
      <p>They will then iron out the final details of their proposal before putting it to Man City.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> have been stop-start in the league so far this season, drawing four and losing one of their opening 11 fixtures.</p>
      <p>Summer signing Eden Hazard is still settling in, and it seems that Real president Florentino Perez is keen to add some extra firepower in January.</p>

      <p>Perez has previously expressed an interest in signing Sterling, who has himself admitted he would like to try his hand in Spain at some point.</p>
      <p>But Sterling has three years left on the £280,000-a-week contract he signed a year ago at Man City and is unlikely to hand in a transfer request to push through a move.</p>
