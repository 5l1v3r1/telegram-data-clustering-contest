Mayhem at Irving Plaza in 2017 (more by Mathieu Bredeau)

Fellow Norwegian black metal bands Mayhem (who just released their great new album Daemon and who have been commenting on the loosely-based-on-Mayhem film Lords of Chaos including in our interview with them on Invisible Oranges) and Abbath (the current project of former Immortal vocalist Abbath Doom Occulta, who put out their great sophomore album Outstrider in July) have been announced as the headliners for the 2020 edition of the Decibel Magazine Tour. It includes the 2020 Philly edition of Decibel Metal & Beer Fest, which both bands play, alongside Converge (performing Jane Doe), Pig Destroyer (performing Prowler in the Yard), Napalm Death (performing Harmony Corruption and Utopia Banished), Satan, Idle Hands, and more. Openers for the Decibel tour are still TBA, but these lineups are usually stacked top to bottom, so you can probably expect more great acts to be added. The 2019 lineup included Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel, Necrot, and Blood Incantation.
The tour kicks off on March 13 in Denver, and hits Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta, Philadelphia, NYC, Boston, Montreal and more, before wrapping up in Chicago on April 10. The NYC date happens at Webster Hall on April 4, and tickets go on sale Friday 11/8 at 10 AM, with an American Express presale starting Wednesday 11/6 at 10 AM. See all dates below.
