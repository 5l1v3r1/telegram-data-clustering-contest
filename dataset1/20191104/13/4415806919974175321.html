      <p>Dublin City Councillors have secured a new deal for a major housing development at O'Devaney Gardens.</p>
      <p>It means 80% of the residential units will be social and affordable, compared to 50% in the original proposal.</p>
      <p>The council will vote tonight on whether to allow the redevelopment of the site off the North Circular Road.</p>
      <p>Cllr Mary Fitzpatrick says the Government has failed to fund a sustainable, affordable and deliverable housing model.</p>
      <p>"For the first time there will be an affordable rental scheme on the site, there will 824 residential units. We are also very proud to have secured ringfencing of three-and-a-half million [euro] for community facilities," she said.</p>
      <p>"There will be no co-living, there will be no student accommodation, there will be no hotels. There will actually be homes."</p>
