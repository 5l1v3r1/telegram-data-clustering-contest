2019國際宇航大會 公私合作 強強聯手

04 Nov 2019, 13:55

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】國際宇航大會（IAC）是每年一次的各國太空機構的大會，集商務和外交於一體，每年由不同的國家主辦。今年的IAC於10月21日～25日在美國華盛頓順利舉行。
據科技網媒TechCrunch報導，這次大會展示了繁榮的世界航空業的最新進展。
● SpaceX目標2022年發射星際飛船（Starship）登陸月球SpaceX公司公布的計畫時間表看起來相當「激進」，鑒於他們是根據以前的成績作出的新規劃，業界將密切關注他們的每一步進展。
其實，SpaceX把星際飛船送達月球的行程安排得這麼緊，不僅是為了激勵其團隊，更是為加入美國宇航局（NASA）的2024人類登月項目，承接月球貨運航線業務做準備。
● 星鏈（Starlink）衛星互聯網服務明年開通這還是SpaceX的消息，該公司很可能將是衛星互聯網通信新時代的先驅供應商。他們的星鏈衛星互聯網項目在首批1.2萬個衛星獲准後，最近又提交了發射另外3萬個衛星的公文待審。
該公司的首席運營官和主席肖特威爾（Gwynne Shotwell）近期表示，他們公司的星鏈寬帶服務明年即可向消費者開放。公司創始人馬斯克（Elon Musk）上週用這個網路發了一條推文，證明該項目已在某種程度上可用。
● 美國宇航局局長談初創公司在下一次登月任務中的合作機會這次大會是很多年來美國再次做東道主。NASA局長布萊登斯汀（Jim Bridenstine）的演講談到了美國2024年人類登月任務，特別對世界各地企業的加盟與美國共同實現這一宏大目標，提出了很多期待。

● 首家太空旅遊業務公司——維珍銀河（Virgin Galactic）上市

維珍旗下的維珍銀河上週在紐約上市，成為經營太空旅遊業務的第一家上市公司。開盤後沒多久，股價已漲了約2%，看來市場對這家公司的認可度還不錯。
該公司最近展出了即將給乘客穿著的旅遊太空服，並透露去一趟太空旅行約25萬美元。他們用的太空船目前最大載客量為6人，目標明年上半年開航。公司稱目前已有600多人報名旅行。
● 亞馬遜（Amazon）總裁上臺領獎電商大戶亞馬遜的總裁貝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）很榮幸地在這次大會期間獲得了第一個業界獎項。獎項的名字似乎不重要，重要的是有機會邀請世界頂級富豪上臺領獎。
亞馬遜怎麼和航空業沾邊了？是的，亞馬遜旗下的藍源（Blue Origin）公司宣布與老牌飛機廠商洛克希德·馬丁（Lockheed Martin）、世界軍工大廠商諾斯洛普·格魯門公司（Northrop Grumman，簡稱諾格）、以及MIT的Draper實驗室，這樣強大的新老太空業機構合作，為2024年登月任務開發全新的著陸和卸貨系統。
● 初創公司火箭實驗室（Rocket Lab）的「光子飛船」展露頭角「火箭實驗室」自2006年創建以來，開發小型火箭，主要承接商業火箭發射低空衛星服務。這次大會上該公司宣布在旺盛的市場需求推動下，公司將擴展業務，利用「光子飛船」提供登月物資運送服務。
該公司計劃最早在2020年第四季度啟動這一長線飛船服務。
● 歐洲太空業也有蓬勃發展另外，來自歐洲的太空技術力量亦不可小覷，鑒於歐洲太空局（ESA）活躍的努力，歐洲在太空業所佔的市場份額可能已經超過了他們在其它行業市場的占比。
明年的國際宇航大會將在阿拉伯舉辦。

2019 International Astronautical Conference

04 Nov 2019, 13:55

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The International Astronautical Congress (IAC) is an annual conference of national space agencies. It integrates business and diplomacy and is hosted by different countries every year. This year's IAC was successfully held in Washington, DC from October 21st to 25th.
According to tech network media TechCrunch, the conference showed the latest developments in the booming world aviation industry.
● SpaceX Target 2022 launches Starship landing on the Moon SpaceX's planned timeline looks quite ""radical"". Given that they are making new plans based on previous achievements, the industry will pay close attention to each step of their progress.
In fact, SpaceX has arranged the interplanetary spacecraft on the moon so tightly, not only to motivate its team, but also to prepare for the NASA's 2024 human moon landing project to undertake the lunar cargo route business.
● Starlink satellite Internet service will be launched next year. This is also the news of SpaceX, which is likely to be a pioneer supplier of the new era of satellite Internet communications. Their Star Chain Satellite Internet project recently submitted a document pending the launch of another 30,000 satellites after the first batch of 12,000 satellites were approved.
The company's chief operating officer and chairman, Gwynne Shotwell, recently said that their company's star-chain broadband service will be available to consumers next year. Company founder Elon Musk posted a tweet on the Internet last week to prove that the project is already available to some extent.
● The Director of NASA talks about the opportunity for the startup to cooperate in the next mission to the moon. This conference has been the host of the United States for many years. NASA Director Jim Bridenstine's speech talked about the US 2024 human mission to the moon, and put forward a lot of expectations for the joining of companies from all over the world and the United States to achieve this grand goal.

● The first space travel business company, Virgin Galactic, went public

Virgin Galactic, owned by Virgin, was listed in New York last week and became the first listed company to operate the space travel business. Not long after the opening, the stock price has risen by about 2%, it seems that the market recognition of the company is not bad.
The company recently unveiled a travel spacesuit that will be worn by passengers and revealed a trip to space for about $250,000. The spacecraft they use currently has a maximum capacity of six passengers and is scheduled to sail in the first half of next year. The company said that more than 600 people have signed up for travel.
● Amazon's president, Jeff Bezos, the president of the award-winning e-commerce giant Amazon, was honored to receive the first industry award during the conference. The name of the award does not seem to matter. It is important to have the opportunity to invite the world's top rich to come to the stage to receive the award.
How does Amazon get along with the aviation industry? Yes, Amazon's Blue Origin announced that it is associated with established aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin and the world's military manufacturer Northrop Grumman (Nog). And MIT's Draper Lab, a powerful new and old space industry agency, to develop a new landing and unloading system for the 2024 mission to the moon.
● Startup Rocket Lab's ""Photon Spaceship"" showcased the ""Rocket Lab"" since its inception in 2006, the development of small rockets, mainly to undertake commercial rocket launch low-altitude satellite services. At the conference, the company announced that under the strong market demand, the company will expand its business and use the ""photon spaceship"" to provide lunar material transportation services.
The company plans to launch the long-haul spacecraft service as early as the fourth quarter of 2020.
● The European space industry is also booming. In addition, the space technology forces from Europe should not be underestimated. Given the active efforts of the European Space Agency (ESA), Europe’s market share in the space industry may have exceeded that of other industries. Proportion.
Next year's International Astronautical Congress will be held in Arabia.
