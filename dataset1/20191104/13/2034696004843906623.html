      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/ash-islands-review">Reviewing Ash’s last album, ‘Islands’, NME’s Mark Beaumont wrote:</a> “These are signs of Ash dove-tailing with the modern alt-rock front-runners, allowing their mature meditations on friendship, betrayal, love and loss to nestle alongside indie’s emotional behemoths.</p>
      <p>“Fans of the ferocious young tykes of 1996 can feast on the savage ‘Buzzkill’, a gymnastic display of punk-pop swearing, but sumptuous post-rock epics like finale ‘Incoming Waves’ point to a grander future for Ash. No band is an island, but Ash’s peaks rise as tall as any other.”</p>
