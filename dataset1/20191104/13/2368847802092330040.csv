澳洲女將巴蒂首次入圍 即奪年終總決賽冠軍

04 Nov 2019, 13:44

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】上週末，在深圳舉行的2019年WTA年終總決賽上，世界排名第一的澳洲女將巴蒂（Ashleigh Barty）以6-4/6-3擊敗了烏克蘭人斯維托麗娜（Elina Svitolina），首次奪得年終總決賽冠軍，並獲得了網球歷史上最大的一筆冠軍獎金——442萬美元。而落敗的斯維托麗娜也拿到了240萬美元獎金。
巴蒂首次入圍 順利奪冠本賽季，23歲的澳洲人巴蒂實現了突破，在法網首次捧起了大滿貫的冠軍獎盃，此後成功登頂了世界第一的寶座。這是巴蒂首次晉級年終總決賽陣容，就一路過關闖進了決賽；而斯維托麗娜是去年的年終總決賽冠軍。兩人此前交手5次，烏克蘭人保持全勝。
首盤比賽，兩人都很快進入狀態，比分一路交替上升，戰至4-4。在斯維托麗娜非保不可的第10局，巴蒂展開猛攻，抓住第3個盤點機會，以一記接發球制勝分，完成關鍵破發，以6-4贏下首盤。
次盤，斯維托麗娜第3局率先破發，巴蒂緊跟著回破。第6局維托麗娜雙誤送禮，巴蒂再次破發，取得4-2領先。接下來兩局，兩人又互相破發對手，巴蒂以5-3進入發球勝賽局。最終，巴蒂保發成功，以6-3再下一城，贏得個人首座年終總決賽的冠軍獎盃。
巴蒂成為繼2001年的小威、2004年莎娃、2011年科維托娃和2016年齊布爾科娃之外，又一位首次入選總決賽便最終奪冠的選手。今年是巴蒂突破性的一年，她在三種不同類型的場地上，一共獲得了四個單打冠軍，奪得年終第一，可謂實至名歸。
本屆WTA年終總決賽，高額的冠軍獎金是一大看點。巴蒂的冠軍獎金達到了442萬美金，創造單一網球賽事最高獎金紀錄。要知道，在網壇四大滿貫中獎金最高的美網奪冠，納達爾今年拿到了385萬美元獎金。而且，巴蒂只需要五連勝即可奪冠，而大滿貫比賽需要七連勝才能登頂。
慢速球場造成四人退賽另外，今年在深圳舉行的年終總決賽，場地條件對比賽造成了很大影響。總共八名參賽選手中，有4人在中途因傷退賽，包括了世界第三、澳網冠軍日本人大坂直美（Osaka Naomi）；世界第四、美網冠軍加拿大姑娘安德萊斯庫（Bianca Andreescu）；世界第七、瑞士女將本西奇（Belinda Bencic）還有和替補上場的荷蘭人貝爾滕斯（Kiki Bertens）。

本西奇退賽後坦言，臨近賽季尾聲，她已經非常疲勞，而深圳慢速球場讓這個問題更加突出：「我認為球場對球員的移動非常不利，而且會對肌肉造成損傷，因為它就像沙地一樣。當你驟然停下，你的肌肉會直接受到衝擊。從訓練一開始，我的身體就感受到了這一點。」
四名退賽選手原因相似，都是與關節和肌肉有關的問題。WTA的主席和首席執行官史蒂夫·西蒙表示，WTA已經獲悉了球員們的意見，明年將會對總決賽的場地做出改進。

The lost Svetolina also received a $2.4 million bonus.
Batty's first finalist Successfully won this season, the 23-year-old Australian Bati achieved a breakthrough, the first time in the French Open to win the Grand Slam championship trophy, and then successfully reached the top of the world's throne. This is the first time that Batty has advanced to the finals of the finals, and he has entered the finals all the way through; and Sveterina is the final of the year-end finals. The two had previously played 5 times and the Ukrainians kept winning.
In the first set of matches, both of them quickly entered the state, and the scores alternated all the way up to 4-4. In the 10th game of Sveterina, Batti launched a storm and seized the opportunity of the third inventory. He won the first break with a score of 6-4.
In the second set, Sveterina was the first to break the third game, and Batty followed suit. In the 6th game, Vitorina gave a double-five gift, and Batty broke again and scored a 4-2 lead. In the next two rounds, the two broke their opponents each other, and Batty entered the game with a 5-3 win. In the end, Batty made a successful victory and won the championship of the first year-end finals with 6-3.
Batty became the player who won the championship in the finals of the first time, in addition to Serena in 2001, Shava in 2004, Kvitova in 2011 and Qibulkova in 2016. This year is a breakthrough year for Batty. She won four singles titles on three different types of venues and won the first place at the end of the year.
In this year's WTA year-end finals, the high prize money is a big attraction. Batty’s championship prize reached $4.42 million, creating the highest bonus record for a single tennis tournament. You should know that the highest-paid US Open in the four major slams in the tennis world won, and Nadal received a prize of $3.85 million this year. Moreover, Batty only needs five consecutive victories to win, and the Grand Slam tournament requires seven consecutive victories to reach the top.
The slow pitch caused four people to retire. In addition, this year's finals in Shenzhen, the venue conditions have had a great impact on the game. Four out of a total of eight contestants retired due to injury, including the world's third, Australian Open champion Osaka Naomi; the world's fourth, US Open champion Canadian girl Andrescu ( Bianca Andreescu); the seventh in the world, the Swiss female Belinda Bencic and the Dutchman Kiki Bertens.

Bencic frankly retired after the game, she was already very tired near the end of the season, and the Shenzhen slow course made this problem more prominent: ""I think the course is very unfavorable for the player's movement and will cause damage to the muscles because it is like Like sand, when you suddenly stop, your muscles are directly affected. From the beginning of training, my body feels this.""
The four retired players have similar reasons and are related to joints and muscles. WTA Chairman and CEO Steve Simon said that the WTA has been informed of the players' opinions and will improve the venue of the finals next year.
