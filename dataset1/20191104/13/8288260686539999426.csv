Today, Google confirmed the acquisition for a total of $2.1bn.
The company first launched in San Francisco, California and is one of the leading players in the growing 'wearable technology tend'.
Their range of products, which vary from watches to 'zips' to wireless headphones and smart scales, are designed to help users track everything from their heart rate to the quality of their sleep.
Many budding fitness enthusiasts also use Fitbits to track the number of steps walked or climbed as well tracking their daily nutritional habits.
Built in alongside their activity trackers, Fitbit also have their own website as well as iOS, Android and Windows mobile phone apps.
Through these devices and using Bluetooth technology, users can then log all of the data tracked by their Fitbits including calories burned and consumed and distances traveled.
