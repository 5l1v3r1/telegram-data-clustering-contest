洗劫一空 貴陽82歲老人遭數十警察抄家

04 Nov 2019, 13:20

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】貴陽市82歲的法輪功學員劉萬琴於今年中秋節前夕，遭到當地派出所警察肆無忌憚地抄家。
明慧網報導，2019年9月12日上午9點多，貴陽市南明區朝陽派出所所長領著約二十幾個警察，闖入劉萬琴老人家中，在沒有出示蒐查證、著便裝的情況下，大肆抄查，搶走老人一直珍藏的各種版本的《轉法輪》及法輪功書籍五六十本、人民幣共1萬多元，以及自編的各種手工藝物件（如蓮花）等，連門上貼的「福」字也被揭下來。
劉萬琴老人於1993年開始修煉法輪功，她一再說：「他們（警察）把我的《轉法輪》、大法經書抄走了，一本都不留！沒有修煉法輪功我早就不在世了，是大法延長了我的生命，而且不是一次，是多次！修煉法輪功是我的信仰！要不是我有二十多年的修煉底子，他們這次刮地皮似的抄家，真的會活活要了我的命！」
以下是劉萬琴被抄家的遭遇。
9月12日上午，劉萬琴在家做飯，聽到敲門聲，起初她以為是孩子給她買月餅來了，因為第二天是中秋節。她正要開門，聽見門外的聲音不是孩子的，便猶豫了。
門外的敲門聲更響了，叫著她的名字讓開門。她下意識地更感到猶豫了，因為敲門的人是片警金穎熏。金每年都要來她家騷擾一兩次。過去她對這些上門的人還挺客氣，讓他們進家門後總是以茶水、果子相待，同時給他們講法輪功真相。
這兩年來，他們雖然也聽真相，但總要在她家裡的幾個屋子裡走來走去地照相，還要對她採血。劉萬琴認為這種騷擾就是對她的一種歧視和迫害，她是合法公民，是修心向善的公民。她不願意他們用敵意、迫害的態度對待她，所以就不願理睬他們。
這時門外面敲門的人換了個男的，說：「你不開門，我們會叫你兒子來給我們開門的。我們沒有別的什麼事情，就是在門外照幾張照片就走人。」劉萬琴不想讓他們驚擾兒子的正常工作，就開門了。
門一開，社區片警金穎薰手指著一位男士對劉萬琴說：「這是我們的頭兒。」這位「頭兒」把他胸前的工作牌在劉萬琴面前亮了一下。
還沒等劉萬琴看清楚他工作牌上寫的是什麼，那個「頭兒」就一把推開她，一步進了客廳。她踉蹌了一下，兩個女的順勢扶著她，她才沒摔倒。
就在這時一下衝進來一二十穿著便服的人，站滿了整個客廳。
「頭兒」到小臥室裡去拍照。那兩個女的一邊一個架著劉萬琴，把她弄在沙發的一角坐著。等她坐穩了，那個「頭兒」走向她，閃電般地把手伸進她的衣兜裡搶鑰匙，把她的衣服口袋撕爛了。
劉萬琴說：「你們真會騙人。說只是照幾張照片，現在還搶鑰匙。請你們出去！」
所有的人都不理睬她的要求。「頭兒」搶了鑰匙後，就去小臥室開她的抽屜和櫃子。
她八十多歲的人，腿腳不太方便。那夥人中有幾個人高高大大的，只專注看管她，並不動手抄東西，所以她只能通過講法輪功真相來試圖阻止他們抄家，但沒有成功。
警察不聽她講，繼續抄家，把整個家抄了個底朝天。中午12點左右，他們收走了很多私人物品。
抄家的人既沒有蒐查證，也不著正裝執行公務，穿著便服抄家。劉萬琴認為，這與土匪私闖民宅，打家劫舍沒有什麼兩樣，抄走了她全部珍貴的私人物品。她完全不能認同他們的所作所為，因而憤然不簽任何字。
劉萬琴的大兒子被他們打電話叫回家來，兒子在警察開列抄家清單上簽了字，但他並沒有一一清點那份所謂的清單。

The looting of an empty 82-year-old man in Guiyang was smashed by dozens of policemen

04 Nov 2019, 13:20

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Liu Wanqin, an 82-year-old Falun Gong practitioner in Guiyang City, was ruthlessly ransacked by the local police station on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival this year.
Minghui.com reported that at 9:00 am on September 12, 2019, the director of the Chaoyang Police Station in Nanming District of Guiyang City led about 20 policemen and broke into the elderly home of Liu Wanqin. In the absence of a search warrant and casual wear, Investigate and snatch the various versions of the ""Zhuan Falun"" and Falun Gong books that the old man has been collecting for fifty or sixty yuan, RMB 10,000 yuan, and various handicraft objects (such as lotus flowers), etc. The word was also revealed.
Liu Wanqin started practicing Falun Gong in 1993. She repeatedly said: ""They (the police) took my ""Zhuan Falun"" and the Dafa scriptures away, and one did not stay! I have not been practicing Falun Gong. I am already dead. Dafa is Dafa. Prolonged my life, and not once, many times! It is my belief to practice Falun Gong! If I have not practiced for more than 20 years, they will scrape their homes like this, and they will really live for my life. !""
The following is the encounter of Liu Wanqin being ransacked.
On the morning of September 12, Liu Wanqin cooked at home and heard the knock on the door. At first she thought it was the child who bought her moon cake because the next day was the Mid-Autumn Festival. She was about to open the door and heard the sound outside the door was not the child, he hesitated.
The knock on the door was louder, calling her name to open the door. She subconsciously felt more hesitant, because the person knocking at the door was a film policeman Jin Ying. Kim comes to her house every year to harass one or two times. In the past, she was very polite to these people who came to the door. After they entered the house, they always treated each other with tea and fruit, and told them the truth about Falun Gong.
In the past two years, although they have listened to the truth, they have to walk around and take pictures in several houses in her house, and they have to collect blood from her. Liu Wanqin believes that this kind of harassment is a kind of discrimination and persecution against her. She is a legal citizen and a citizen who is good at heart. She did not want them to treat her with hostility and persecution, so she did not want to pay attention to them.
At this time, the person knocking at the door changed a man and said, ""If you don't open the door, we will ask your son to open the door for us. We have nothing else, just take a few photos outside the door and leave."" Liu Wanqin didn't want them to disturb their son's normal work and opened the door.
As soon as the door opened, the community film Jin Yingxun pointed a man to Liu Wanqin and said, ""This is our head."" The ""head"" lighted the work card on his chest in front of Liu Wanqin.
I haven't waited for Liu Wanqin to see what he wrote on his work card. The ""head"" pushed her away and stepped into the living room. She stunned, and the two women took advantage of her, she didn't fall.
At this moment, I rushed in. One of the people wearing casual clothes stood full of the living room.
""Head"" to take a photo in the small bedroom. The two women were holding Liu Wanqin on one side and sitting on the corner of the sofa. When she sat down, the ""head"" walked towards her, lightning-fastly reaching into her pocket to grab the key and tearing her pocket.
Liu Wanqin said: ""You really deceive people. Just say a few photos, and still grab the keys. Please go out!""
All people ignored her request. After the ""head"" grabbed the key, she went to the small bedroom to open her drawers and cabinets.
Her eighty-year-olds have inconvenient legs and feet. Some of the group were tall and tall, only focused on her, and did not copy things, so she could only try to prevent them from copying home by telling the truth about Falun Gong, but it did not succeed.
The police did not listen to her, continued to copy the house, and copied the whole family to the bottom. Around 12 noon, they took away a lot of personal belongings.
The person who ransacked the house did not have a search warrant, nor did he dress up to perform official duties, and dressed in a casual suit. Liu Wanqin believes that this is no different from the private residence of the bandits, and it is no different from the house, and she has taken away all her precious personal belongings. She couldn't agree with what they did, and she didn't sign any words.
Liu Wanqin’s eldest son was called to go home, and his son signed the police list, but he did not count the so-called list.
