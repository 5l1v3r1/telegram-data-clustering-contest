      <h1>UPDATED: Appeal Court sacks another top APC lawmaker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:46:09+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/360929-just-in-appeal-court-sacks-another-top-apc-lawmaker.html" target="_blank">Nasir Ayitogo</a></address>
      <p>The Court of Appeal in Kaduna has sacked the House Leader, Alhassan Doguwa.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Nigerian newspaper, the appellate court in a unanimous judgement nullified the entire election in the two local government areas Mr Doguwa represents.</p>
      <p>The ranking lawmaker represents Tudunwada/Doguwa Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>The court, in a judgement delivered by Oludotun Adefope-Okojie, ordered fresh elections in the constituency.</p>
      <p>The sack occurs days after another House of Reps member from Kano, Abdulmumin Jibrin, was also sacked by the appeal court.</p>
      <p>Just like Mr Doguwa, the court ordered a fresh election in the two local governments of Kiru and Bebeji which constitutes Mr Jibrin’s federal constituency.</p>
      <h4>Journey to justice</h4>
      <p>The National Assembly election tribunal had dismissed a petition filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Yusha’u Salisu, against Mr Doguwa’s election for failure to prove allegations of irregularities and over-voting in the election.</p>
      <p>But the Court of Appeal judges said they wondered how the tribunal arrived at the conclusion that PDP and its candidate had failed to prove their case.</p>
      <p>While setting aside the tribunal judgement, the court nullified the entire election in the two local government areas Mr Doguwa represents, saying the whole process was marred by irregularities.</p>
      <p>The appellate court held that the entire election could not stand as Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had omitted other parties from the final declaration of the result.</p>
      <p>The court said INEC made a ‘substantial breach’ by writing the results of only two of the 53 parties that participated in the election in Form EC 8 (II) E.</p>
      <p>The court therefore ordered INEC to conduct fresh election within 90 days in the entire constituency.</p>
      <h4>End of the road for ‘House Leader’?</h4>
      <p>Mr. Doguwa emerged as the house majority leader at the beginning of the ninth assembly after a consensus by the North-West caucus of the house.</p>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) had announced its decision to zone the position to the North-West.</p>
      <p>Mr Doguwa served as Chief Whip in the eight assembly, led by former speaker Yakubu Dogara.</p>
      <p>Before his sack, he was one of the oldest members of the house, having been elected for a fifth term. He was first elected in the short-lived Fourth Republic in 1993.</p>
      <p>It is not yet clear if Mr. Doguwa’s position as House Leader would be filled by another lawmaker or would be left vacant till the outcome of the fresh election is determined.</p>
      <p>When contacted to comment on the possibility of announcing a new leader, Lanre Lasisi, spokesperson to the Speaker did not respond to phone calls.</p>
