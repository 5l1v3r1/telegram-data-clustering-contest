莫文蔚台北開唱老公愛相隨　吳宗憲盡地主之誼：帶他去看制服店
04 Nov 2019, 13:58 by 蔡世偉, 陳仁萱, 洪偉韜
莫文蔚12/7、8日將於台北小巨蛋舉辦《絕色莫文蔚 世界巡迴演唱會 巔峰之旅 台北站》演唱會，今（4日）特別將電視宣傳唯一通告獻給吳宗憲、Lulu、陳漢典主持的三立《綜藝大熱門》，吳宗憲也好奇這次演唱會真的是她的告別演唱會嗎？莫文蔚趕緊澄清表示：「不是退休，是不開大型演唱，將會換方式表演，投入音樂劇。」



莫文蔚這次將唯一通告獻給《綜藝大熱門》，吳宗憲也很有誠意的親寫「爆了！」二字書法贈予莫文蔚，他還說莫文蔚聲音太特別，《陰天》及《廣島之戀》是自己最愛的2首，也是KTV必點歌曲，特別是《廣島之戀》，笑稱「把妹很好用」。莫文蔚在小巨蛋已第5次開唱，她表示這次2場演唱會很絕，2天完全不同曲目，而愛開玩笑的吳宗憲還說這樣他一定要「破費」2次去買演唱會的門票。


吳宗憲親筆寫上「爆了」，預祝莫文蔚演唱會門票大賣。

莫文蔚難得上節目，吳宗憲當然沒放過可以調侃她的機會，笑說有一段時間無法對莫文蔚諒解，原因竟是她嫁給外國人，2人在合照時，在大家的慫恿下，拍了一組模仿蔡依林與「五月天」阿信演唱會上求婚下腰的照片。


莫文蔚澄清巡迴演唱會後將不再個唱，將專注在音樂劇上。

吳宗憲還不忘趁機推銷自家產品，從吸塵器、行李箱、按摩器都說要送一套給莫文蔚，還開玩笑表示想拍《雞姊外傳》，力邀莫文蔚演出，結果遭打槍。愛開玩笑的憲哥最後更力邀莫文蔚老公在演唱會期間來台，願盡地主之誼「帶妳老公去看看台灣的制服店文化。」嚇的莫文蔚直喊：「那還是不要帶他來了」。

Karen Mok sings her husband in Taipei, and Wu Zongxian is the landlord's friendship: take him to see the uniform shop
04 Nov 2019, 13:58 by Cai Shiwei, Chen Renxuan, Hong Weiwei
On the 12th and 7th of the 8th, Karen Mok will hold a concert at the Taipei Summit of the ""Most of the Karen World Tour"" at the Taipei Arena. Today (4th), the only notice of TV publicity will be dedicated to Wu Zongxian, Lulu and Chen Handian. San Li, ""The Best of Variety,"" Wu Zongxian is also curious that this concert is really her farewell concert? Karen Mok quickly clarified: ""It is not retirement. It is not a big concert. It will be changed and performed in a musical.""



Mo Wenwei gave the only notice to ""The Best of Variety"", and Wu Zongxian also wrote a ""call out!"" two-character calligraphy to Mo Wenwei. He also said that Mo Wenwei’s voice is too special, ""Cloudy"" and ""Love of Hiroshima"". ""It is my favorite 2 songs, and it is also a must-attend song for KTV, especially ""Love of Hiroshima"", laughing and saying ""use the girl very well."" Karen Mok has been singing for the fifth time in the little dome. She said that the two concerts are very good. Two days are completely different, and Wu Zongxian, who is joking, said that he must ""buy fees"" twice to buy tickets for the concert. .


Wu Zongxian personally wrote ""explosion"" and wished that Mo Wenwei's concert tickets would be sold.

Mo Wenwei was rarely on the show. Wu Zongxian certainly did not let go of the opportunity to tease her. She laughed that she could not understand Mo Wenwei for some time. The reason was that she married a foreigner. When they took a group photo, they took a picture of everyone. The group imitated the photos of Jolin Tsai and the ""Mayday"" Ashin concert.


Karen Mok will clarify that he will not sing after the concert and will focus on the musical.

Wu Zongxian also did not forget to take the opportunity to sell his own products. From the vacuum cleaners, suitcases and massagers, he said that he would send a set to Karen Mok. He also joked that he wanted to shoot ""Chicken Biography"" and invited Mo Wenwei to perform. He was shot. The grateful brother finally invited Ms. Karen to come to Taiwan during the concert. She is willing to do her best to ""see the husband's uniform shop culture in Taiwan."" Scared Mo Wenwei shouted: ""That is still not to bring him. """".
