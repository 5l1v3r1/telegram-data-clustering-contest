      <p>The president played coy with the news report that described his word as a “mistweet” after the original sparked a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/covfefe-trump-typo-turned-meme/579763/">flood </a>of headline and cable chatter in May 2017.</p>
      <p>“But how do you know it was a ‘mistweet?'” he asked. “May be something with deep meaning!”</p>
      <p>“Despite the constant negative press covfefe,” Trump wrote on May 31, 2017.</p>
