Antivirus deals: What to look for
Unless you’ve got some sort of security software installed, your PC, laptop or mobile device is vulnerable. Antivirus software detects, and then prevents, disarms or removes malicious programs and malware, often referred to as ‘viruses’.
But security software is no longer just about countering viruses. Also important (arguably more so) is the security of personal data and protection from ransomware.
Check that the antivirus software you’re buying has ransomware protection built-in, and it’s also worth looking out for the ability to detect malware is so new that it hasn’t yet been analysed by security companies. This may be bolstered by a cloud element or artificial intelligence, which can really help to ensure that even the most sophisticated attacks get nowhere near your devices.
Antivirus discounts are plentiful, often with more than 50% off for your Mac, PC or mobile device. Sometimes these discounts are available on the websites of the antivirus providers themselves in the form of a digital download, but you can also find cheap boxed versions of the software from the likes of Amazon, Argos and Currys PC World.
