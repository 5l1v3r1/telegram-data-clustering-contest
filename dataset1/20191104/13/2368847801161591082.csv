韓情報透露：金正恩12月將晤川普

04 Nov 2019, 13:41

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】韓國國家情報院4日向國會情報委員會朝野議員透露，掌握到朝鮮領導人金正恩已決定在12月與美國總統川普第4次會晤的情資。
韓聯社報導，國家情報院認為，實務協商會在11月中或最晚12月初展開，以協調舉行第4次川金會。
這是國家情報院在國會進行的非公開國政閉門報告後，國會情報委員會的朝野政黨幹事－執政黨共同民主黨國會議員金民基（音）、在野黨自由韓國黨國會議員李恩載（音）走出會場向國會記者們公布這項訊息。
川普與金正恩在2018年6月12日於新加坡舉行首次歷史性高峰會；今年2月27日、28日兩人在越南河內再度舉行高峰會，但未達成協議，兩國磋商陷入停滯。今年6月30日川金二人在分隔韓朝的非軍事區（DMZ）第3度會談。
10月27日，朝鮮中央通信社（KCNA）才發布朝鮮「亞太和平委員會」（Asia－Pacific Peace Committee）主席金英哲（Kim Yong Chol）的聲明，當中語帶威脅的表示，美國若因川普和金正恩的「私人關係密切」，就不理會今年底的核談期限，那就錯了。
金英哲在聲明中說，朝鮮和美國的關係一直沒有進展，彼此也都還懷有敵意，可能導致交火。

Han intelligence revealed: Kim Jong-un will meet with Trump in December

04 Nov 2019, 13:41

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The National Intelligence Agency of South Korea revealed to the Congressional Intelligence Committee on the 4th that it had learned that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had decided to meet with US President Trump for the fourth time in December.
The Yonhap News Agency reported that the National Intelligence Agency believes that the substantive consultation will be held in mid-November or at the beginning of December to coordinate the fourth Sichuan Gold Council.
This is after the National Intelligence Agency’s closed report on the closed state of the National Assembly, the ruling party’s ruling party party, the ruling party’s Democratic Party member Kim Min Ki, and the opposition party’s Liberal Party member Li Enzai (voice) walked out of the venue. Congressional reporters announced the message.
Trump and Kim Jong-un held their first historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018. On February 27 and 28 this year, the two held another summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. However, no agreement was reached and the negotiations between the two countries fell into stagnation. On June 30 this year, Kawasaki held a third meeting in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Korean Empire.
On October 27th, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) issued a statement from Kim Yong Chol, chairman of the North Asia Pacific Peace Committee, saying that the US threatened that the United States would be due to Trump. If Kim Jong-un’s ""personal relationship is close"", he will ignore the deadline for nuclear talks at the end of this year. That is wrong.
In his statement, Jin Yingzhe said that the relationship between the DPRK and the United States has not progressed and that they are still hostile to each other and may lead to exchange of fire.
