04 Nov 2019, 13:46 by 蔡世偉
昨日（3日）林柏宏攜新作《冰峰暴》亮相第32屆東京國際電影節。在首映會上，林柏宏親切的用日語和現場觀眾打招呼，博得一片好評，日方工作人員還問林柏宏是不是學日文很久了，發音相當準確，讓林柏宏相當開心，他表示自己特地找了日本朋友幫忙練習，希望能讓日本觀眾感受到他的誠意。
在首映會上林柏宏被問及對於角色的理解，他坦言：「除了自己要學習直升機駕駛知識外，還有許多在雪山裡的動作戲，不僅需要克服極端天氣的寒冷，也讓我深深感受到登山救援隊需要强大的心理意志力，才能勝任這份工作。」林柏宏為了演好直升機駕駛員，在開拍前接受了難度極高的專業訓練，在拍攝過程中還經常請教技術顧問許多相關問題，力求還原角色最真實的狀態，讓顧問也大讚林柏宏的敬業態度。

這次的東京國際電影節也是《冰峰暴》的3位主演役所廣司、張靜初和林柏宏在拍攝殺青後再次合體，繼去年林柏宏自己去東京旅行和役所廣司約吃飯見面後，這也是兩人相隔一年後再次碰面。
每次見面都會互送禮物的兩人這次也不例外，役所廣司送了林柏宏一個日本招財貓，還開玩笑的地說希望林柏宏可以放在自己家門口，讓《冰峰暴》招來更多粉絲進戲院觀看，而林柏宏知道役所廣司愛吃甜食，這次也送了他台灣零食牛軋糖做為回禮。

Lin Bohong's gentleman's debut ""Ice Peak Storm"" plays the helicopter driver is not afraid of the challenge
04 Nov 2019, 13:46 by Cai Shiwei
Yesterday (3rd) Lin Bohong and his new work ""Ice Peak Storm"" appeared at the 32nd Tokyo International Film Festival. At the premiere, Lin Baihong cordially greeted the audience with the Japanese audience and won praise. The Japanese staff also asked Lin Baihong whether he had studied Japanese for a long time. The pronunciation was quite accurate, and Lin Bohong was quite happy. He said that he specifically looked for Japan. My friend helped me to practice, hoping to make the Japanese audience feel his sincerity.
At the premiere, Lin Bohong was asked about his understanding of the role. He said frankly: ""In addition to learning about helicopter driving, there are many action scenes in the snowy mountains. It is not only necessary to overcome the extreme cold of the weather, but also to make me deeply I feel that the mountain rescue team needs strong psychological willpower to be qualified for the job."" Lin Bohong received a very difficult professional training before the start of the shoot in order to play the helicopter pilot. During the filming process, he often consulted technical consultants. The problem is to restore the true state of the character, so that the consultant also praises Lin Bohong's professional attitude.

This time, the Tokyo International Film Festival is also the three main acting halls of ""Bingfeng Storm"". Guangsi, Zhang Jingchu and Lin Baihong once again fit together after filming. After Lin Bohong went to Tokyo to travel to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and met with him, this is also a year apart. After meeting again.
The two people who will give each other gifts each time are no exceptions. The sergeant Guangsi sent a Linbao Hong Japanese lucky cat, and jokingly said that Lin Bohong could be placed at his doorstep, so that ""Bingfengstorm"" would attract more fans. The theater watched, and Lin Baihong knew that the company had eaten sweets, and this time he also sent his Taiwanese snack nougat as a gift.
