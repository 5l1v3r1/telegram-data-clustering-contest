Former Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes suffered an horrific injury in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham.
The Portuguese player had to be taken from the field on a stretcher after Son Heung Min’s challenge saw him fall badly as he was caught, appearing to suffer what might well be a broken ankle.
Son was sent off after VAR looked at the incident, for “endangering the safety of another player&rdquor;.
“(I) didn’t want to look too much at what happened. I want to send best wishes,&rdquor; said Dele Alli.
""Son is devastated and in tears. It’s not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you’ve ever met. He can’t even lift his head up, he’s crying so much.
12 minutes were added on at Goodison Park for the injury and Everton used it to equalise, with Cenk Tosun netting at the death after Alli’s opener.
