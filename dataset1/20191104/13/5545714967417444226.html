      <h1>Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic hired the father of Mumbo</h1>
      <h2>Former Rare designer Ed Bryan joins the team</h2>

      <p>Another ex-Rare developer has joined forces with Playtonic Games, the team behind <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-yooka-laylee-425484.phtml"><i>Yooka-Laylee</i></a> and its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-568279.phtml"><i>Impossible Lair</i></a> follow-up. This time, it's none other than character artist Ed Bryan – the self-described "father" of Mumbo Jumbo and the Jinjos from <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, as well as <a href="https://yooka-laylee.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Puzz">Dr. Puzz</a> from <i>Yooka</i>.</p>
      <p>Admit it: you can still vividly hear the jingle that plays whenever you rescue a hapless little Jinjo from certain doom. Ed Bryan played no small part in making <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> a magical game, and given Playtonic's current trajectory, I'm excited to see what he'll contribute to the <i>Yooka-Laylee</i> series.</p>
      <p>The original game missed the mark for me in a few areas, but given how well <i>Impossible Lair </i>turned out, I'm hopeful about <i>Yooka</i>'s prospects. For all we know, Playtonic's third title could be another departure. Still, part of me would love for this team to take another stab at creating a nostalgic 3D platformer.</p>
