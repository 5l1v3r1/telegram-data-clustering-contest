      <p>LOS ANGELES:Â LeBron James delivered his second straight triple double as the Los Angeles Lakers won their fifth game in a row for the first time in over a year with a 103-96 victory against the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
      <p>James finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists for the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs six seasons in a row and went the entire 2018-19 season without winning five consecutive games.</p>

      <p>The Spurs kept it close in the fourth thanks to Dejounte Murray's 16 consecutive San Antonio points. He made a layup with just over four minutes to play to tie the contest 90-90. Los Angeles then went on a 9-2 to hold off the Spurs down the stretch and get the victory.</p>
      <p>"It was about us and how we could execute on the offensive end which we did," James said. "We got great looks.</p>
      <p>"We take so much pride on defence. We want to try to keep their guys uncomfortable. We held a great offensive team to 40 percent shooting and under 100 points."</p>
      <p>Anthony Davis finished with 25 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers, who are trying to rebuild their team around James, who also had a triple double two nights earlier against Dallas.</p>
      <p>Avery Bradley added 16 points while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Dwight Howard had 14 points each. Howard also grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds for the Lakers, who improved to 5-1 on the season.</p>
      <p>Lakers head coach Frank Vogel was especially pleased with the play of journeyman reserve player Howard, who is with his fifth team in the last five seasons.</p>
      <p>The former first overall draft pick by Orlando in 2004 is past his prime as a starter in the league and appears to be more comfortable coming off the bench.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'DOMINATING' ON DEFENSE</b>
      </p>
      <p>"He's bought into his role on this team ... he is dominating on the defensive end," Vogel said of the 33-year-old Howard.</p>
      <p>Murray produced 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Spurs, who lost at home for the first time in four games this season.</p>
      <p>Rudy Gay and Derrick White added 16 and 12 points, respectively, off the bench, with DeMar DeRozan scoring 14 points and Bryn Forbes hitting for 12 for San Antonio.</p>
      <p>Kyle Kuzma's 38-foot buzzer-beater allowed the Lakers to finish the second quarter with a 10-0 run and take a 56-43 lead at halftime.</p>
      <p>Gay's jump shot from near half court at the end of the third quarter gave the Lakers a 77-72 lead heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Luka Doncic also recorded his second consecutive triple-double as the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 131-111.</p>
      <p>Doncic, of Slovenia, finished with 29 points, 14 rebounds and 15 assists for the Mavericks, who trailed 73-69 with 4:52 remaining in the third quarter before dominating the rest of the game.</p>
      <p>The 20-year old Doncic is the youngest player in NBA history to have back to back 25-point triple doubles. It is the 11th triple double of his burgeoning career.</p>
      <p>Doncic shot nine-for-17 overall and five-for-10 from three-point range to reach his 29 points. His 14 rebounds were the third most of his career and his 15 assists tied a career best.</p>
      <p>He also had 15 assists in a triple double performance against the Lakers on Friday night, a game in which he suffered a head injury after being blindsided by the Lakers' Howard.</p>
      <p>Latvia's Kristaps Porzingis chipped in with 18 points, Jalen Brunson 14, Seth Curry 13, Boban Marjanovic, of Serbia, and Tim Hardaway 12 apiece, and Dorian Finney-Smith 10 for the Mavericks, who have alternated wins and losses in their last five games.</p>
      <p>Kevin Love had a team-high 29 points, while Tristan Thompson added 11 points and 12 rebounds for Cleveland, which led by as many as eight in the first quarter.</p>
