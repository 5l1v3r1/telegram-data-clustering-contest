      <h1>Browns Cut Jermaine Whitehead After Calling Reporter a 'Cracker'</h1>
      <h2>The Cleveland Browns have dumped safety Jermaine Whitehead after he threatened a reporter and called him “cracker,” in a Twitter post on Sunday.</h2>

      <p>Whitehead posted his ill-advised reply to sports reporter Dustin Fox who was critical of the player’s tackling during the Brown’s loss to the Denver Broncos.</p>
      <p>Replying to Fox’s claim that Whitehead’s effort at tackling was “a joke,” the player went on a rant filled with threats and name calling.</p>
      <p>“Come get it in blood bitch made ass lil boy,” Whitehead tweeted. “I’m out there with a broken hand. Don’t get smoked fuck ass cracker.”</p>

      <p>Almost immediately, though, the Browns took action and dumped the player:</p>

      <p>Clearly the Browns are not going to put up with such hateful, violent, and foul attacks on the press.</p>
