      <p>Some people don't like to pick out a starter Pokémon until they know dang well what they're in for further down the evolutionary line. Well, you don't have to wait any longer – a big (and entirely expected) leak happened less than two weeks before<i> Sword </i>and <i>Shield </i>launch on Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>If you care to spoil the newcomers, the starter evolutions, the regional variants, and even the entire Galar Pokédex, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-sword-and-shield-spoiler-leaks-and-datamine-thread-discussion-guidelines-in-op.150651/">you can do exactly that</a>, though I'd advise <b>caution</b> before you go wild. I saw too much.</p>
      <p>That said, I now know my starter selection. I'm glad I took a peek at those specific spoilers.</p>
      <p>I originally leaned toward Sobble, the Water-type starter, when <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield </i>were first getting underway. With only one exception – <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Popplio_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Popplio</a> – I've never strayed from that course, so it felt right. Having now seen what the timid lizard grows into, I'm doubling down on my gut reaction. <i>It's done</i>.</p>
      <p>What are you thinking, though? Sobble, Scorbunny, or Grookey?</p>
