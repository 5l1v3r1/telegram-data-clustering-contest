Milwaukee police report an arrest in an acid attack that sent a 42-year-old man to the hospital.
Police say they arrested a 61-year-old man Saturday in connection with an ""aggravated battery"" near the same south side location where the victim says he was attacked Friday.
The victim, Mahud Villalaz, says a man at a bus stop began berating him and then threw acid onto his face from a metal bottle. Villalaz suffered second-degree burns to his face and was treated at a hospital.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports Villalaz's family released a statement thanking police for an arrest in the case.
Police say charges will be brought to the Milwaukee County district attorney's office in the next couple of days.
