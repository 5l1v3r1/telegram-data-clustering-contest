      <p>SEOUL:Â <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/mattel-barbie-dolls-bts-kpop-band-toys-12045696">BTS megastar</a> Jungkook was responsible for a weekend car accident, his K-pop agency admitted on Monday (Nov 4), apologising to the victim and his fans.</p>
      <p>The singer's vehicle hit a taxi in Seoul on Saturday, and both he and the cab driver have since been treated for minor injuries, according to police in the capital.</p>

      <p>"Last week, while driving his vehicle, Jungkook hit another car due to his own mistake," the singer's agency Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Immediately after the accident took place, Jungkook admitted he had violated the traffic laws ... and reached an amicable settlement with the victim.</p>
      <p>"We once again apologise to the victim. We also apologise to the fans for causing concerns."</p>
      <p>An official from the National Police Agency told AFP that the star was sober when the accident took place, but declined to say what the violation was.</p>
      <p>"The investigation is still ongoing and we are trying to find out if both parties are mutually at fault," they said.</p>
      <p>The accident happened just days after BTS held the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/k-pop-s-bts-finish-tour-with-millions-generated-12051552">finale of a lucrative world tour in Seoul</a>.</p>
      <p>BTS is the first K-pop group to top charts in the US and Britain, having performed a string of sold-out shows in Los Angeles, Paris, and London's Wembley Stadium.</p>
