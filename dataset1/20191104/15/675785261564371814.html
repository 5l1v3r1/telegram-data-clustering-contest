      <p>In a case of the early bird catching the worm, families could bag cheap UK breaks for 2020 in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/travelodge">Travelodge</a>'s latest sale.</p>
      <p>The budget hotel chain has slashed prices across its UK hotels, with 700,000 rooms currently going from £28.99 a night.</p>
      <p>Based on a family of four sharing a family room, that works out at £7.24pp a night.</p>
      <p>The best part is that the rooms are available across the chain's 570 UK hotels so there's ample opportunity to bag a bargain whether you're after a city break, countryside retreat or seaside escape.</p>
      <p>You can already book the discounted rooms on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelodge.co.uk%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Ftravel%2Fuk-ireland%2Ftravelodges-latest-sale-family-rooms-20809809">Travelodge website</a> but once all 700,000 rooms are snapped up, that's it.</p>
      <p>When we took a look we could find the cheapest rooms for travel dates in January and February although some were during the week - however, we did find rooms from £31.99 during the February half term dates at Lake District hotels.</p>
