（中央社記者楊明珠東京4日專電）日本CBC電視台報導，今天下午位於岐阜縣被列為世界遺產的白川鄉合掌村建築物起火燃燒，疑是車庫電源設備釀禍。合掌村原訂今天晚上要舉行的光雕活動臨時取消。



位於白川鄉與五箇山的合掌村是當地合掌造聚落的總稱，於1995年12月9日被聯合國教科文組織登錄為世界文化遺產。合掌造是指日本一種特殊的民宅形式，特色是以茅草覆蓋的屋頂，呈人字型的屋頂如同雙手合十一般，於是就被稱為「合掌」。
日本JX通信社報導，今天下午2時43分（台灣時間1時43分）左右開始，推特上有多人上傳資訊表示，岐阜縣大野郡白川村的荻町附近發生火災。有目擊者表示，看到火勢猛烈。另有網友說，有聽到爆炸聲響，周邊濃煙密佈，火勢猛烈。



有消息指出，發生火災的地方距離被列為重要文化財（重要古蹟）的「和田家住宅」等所在的合掌村約500多公尺，附近商店人員表示，火災起火地點距離觀光客用的停車場很近，疑似是車庫起火。
AbemaTV報導，世界遺產合掌村所在的岐阜縣白川村荻町的小屋今天下午發生火災，消防單位至少出動3輛消防車滅火。消防單位指出，目前尚未傳出有人員受傷。
有人從停在火災現場附近的巴士拍攝火災情況，從影片看來，小屋後方有大火柱。火災附近的商店店員表示，起火的是小型的合掌建築，並非是有人居住的小屋。（編輯：周永捷）1081104

(Central News Agency reporter Yang Mingzhu, Tokyo, 4th) The Japanese CBC TV reported that the buildings in Hezhang Village, Baichuan Township, which was listed as a World Heritage Site in Jixian County, were burning and burning this afternoon. Hezhang Village originally scheduled to cancel the light sculpture event to be held this evening.



The Hezhang Village, located in Baichuan Township and Wuyi Mountain, is the general name for the local collective settlement. It was registered as a World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO on December 9, 1995. The combination of palms refers to a special form of residence in Japan. It is characterized by a thatched roof. The herringbone roof is like a hand-wound, so it is called ""the palm.""
Japan’s JX News Agency reported that at about 2:43 pm (1:43 pm Taiwan time), there were many people on Twitter who reported that there was a fire near the town of Shirakawa, Ogawa-gun, Ogawa-gun, Gifu Prefecture. Witnesses said that they saw the fire. Another netizen said that there was an explosion of sound, and the surrounding smoke was densely covered and the fire was fierce.



It is reported that the place where the fire broke out was more than 500 meters away from the Heshang Village, which is listed as an important cultural property (important monument), and the nearby store staff said that the fire was located at the parking lot for tourists. Very close, it is suspected that the garage is on fire.
AbemaTV reported that a fire broke out in the huts of Shirakawa, Shirakawa-mura, Gifu Prefecture, where the world heritage site is located. The fire-fighting unit fired at least three fire engines. The fire department pointed out that there have been no injuries.
Some people took pictures of the fire from a bus parked near the scene of the fire. From the film's point of view, there was a large fire column behind the hut. The store clerk near the fire said that the fire was a small palm-handed building, not an inhabited cottage. (Editor: Zhou Yongjie) 1081104
