Netizens are speculating whether Big Bang will make a comeback as a group.YG Entertainment released a statement on the 4th confirming that Big Bang members Taeyang and Daesung will be discharged from the military on the 10th following G Dragon's discharge on October 26th. GD recently began promotions with a brand pictorial after his release and had previously stated at his discharge ceremony that ""he will be going back to his main job as a singer.""The group has been under controversy this year due to 'Burning Sun Gate' that led to member Seungri not only leaving the group but also ending his contract with YG Entertainment. Seungri and Yang Hyun Suk have also been under controversy for illegal gambling activities abroad and alleged prostitution that led to Yang Hyun Suk stepping down as the executive producer. T.O.P who also recently completed his military duties, was indicted for smoking marijuana in June 2017 and had to delay his military enlistment.Many are curious whether the members will comeback with solo promotions as well as a group comeback as ""four"" following Seungri's departure.




1. [+1,705, -83] This is a country of dogs and pigs so of course they'll comeback and line up the charts like Balchimong~
2. [+1,374, -85] Pffffft, get this druggie anchovy out of here.
3. [+1,241, -52] We should start a project group with Seungri, Jung Joon Young, MC Mong and Yoo Seung Junㅋㅋㅋ
4. [+52, -1] Didn't TOP say with his own mouth that he's not coming back? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
5. [+41, -1] The fans are the problematic ones...regardless of what scandal they get into they're ""forever our oppa""ㅋㅋㅋ
6. [+32, -2] After Seungri and TOP's scandals I was done with Big Bang...I just want to erase those old memories..
7. [+27, -11] I don't want to see this gang of criminals...Taeyang should hurry and leave the team and comeback solo
8. [+26, -2] Who exactly is anticipating their return? ㅋㅋㅋ
9. [+23, -4] I'll never buy their brand or listen to any of their songs...but I'm sure there's a lot of pigs out there that will..
10. [+23, -2] ? surely it won't be the complete team...
11. [+23, -7] Two druggies..one sex offender...one left and I doubt the other one is normal either ㅋ
12. [+20, -2] Who the hell is anticipating their return?!!!
