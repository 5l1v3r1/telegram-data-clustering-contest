      <p>Aviation is not in the investment purview of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hinduja-group">Hinduja group </a>in India, said Dheeraj G Hinduja, Chairman, Ashok Leyland Ltd.</p>
      <p>"We get various investment proposals. However, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aviation-sector">aviation sector </a>is not in the investment purview of the family," Hinduja told IANS on Monday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hinduja-group">Hinduja group </a>had considered investing in Jet Airways but later decided against it.</p>
      <p>With the central government planning to rope in a private player for Air India as part of the state-owned airline's divestment plans, Hinduja was asked on the possibilities of the groups's interest in the sector.</p>
