The parties were unable to reach any agreement and, fearing that the Englishman's current valuation is likely to increase even further next season, Real are now reportedly preparing to try to convince City to sell their star man in January by using wantaway forward Bale as part of the deal.
Despite Los Blancos' advances, however, Citizens boss Pep Guardiola is said to have no interest in bringing Bale to the Etihad Stadium, and is unlikely to entertain any offer for the Three Lions forward.
