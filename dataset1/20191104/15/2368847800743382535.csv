傳任學峰被約談事涉P2P 從京西賓館墜樓亡訃告流出

04 Nov 2019, 15:31

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】年僅54歲的中共重慶市委副書記任學峰突然離世，自殺傳聞滿天飛。網傳訃告顯示，任學峰是10月31日死於北京。還有消息稱，任學峰進京參加中共四中全會即被約談，四中閉幕當天在京西賓館跳樓。
重慶官媒11月3日突然通報稱，任學峰「近日因病離世」。香港《星島日報》報導，任學鋒曾經墜樓，並缺席了四中全會。
網傳消息稱，任學鋒去北京參加四中全會，即被中紀委約談，涉及在廣州時的一個P2P項目問題。10月31日在京西賓館7樓跳下。重慶常務副市長吳存榮留在北京處理後事。
網上同時傳出一張訃告照片，或從側面證實了上述消息。訃告顯示，任雪峰死於10月31日，遺體告別儀式在北京昌平殯儀館舉行。這顯示重慶官方反常延遲3天公布死訊，而且議題告別式也不是按慣例在中共高級官員公墓八寶山舉行。

中共第十九屆四中全會於10月28日至31日在北京京西賓館舉行。若上述消息屬實，任學峰可能一入住京西賓館就被中紀委軟禁調查，並在四中全會結束當天絕望自殺。
四中全會被認為內鬥陰雲籠罩，外界曾傳當局可能在會前打下一個「大老虎」恐嚇政敵。雖然最終沒有「大老虎」落馬，但如果在會議期間當場拿下一個副部級「老虎」，相信震懾作用也不小。
據港媒報導，2017年7月，時任重慶市委書記孫政才也是在進京參加全國金融工作會議期間，被留置在京西賓館。孫政才被指江澤民派系指定接班人，陰謀篡權。
任學峰在去年7月美中貿易談判膠着之際，也曾被傳將取代習近平親信劉鶴，主導美中談判。結果是當年10月，任學峰從中共廣東副書記兼廣州市委書記的位置上調任重慶市委副書記，被指遭變相貶官。
任學峰仕途始於天津，曾任天津市副市長，並在天津輔佐過張高麗、孫春蘭和黃興國等一眾江派高官。也有分析認為，任學峰死於中共「路線之爭」，任出身於經濟官僚，可能對當局「用政治指引經濟」不滿。

The transfer of Xue Feng was talked about about P2P from the Jingxi Hotel.

04 Nov 2019, 15:31

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the CPC Chongqing Municipal Committee, who was only 54 years old, suddenly passed away, and suicide rumors were flying all over the sky. According to the net report, Ren Xuefeng died in Beijing on October 31. There is also news that Ren Xuefeng went to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party and was interviewed. On the closing day of the Fourth Middle School, he jumped at the Jingxi Hotel.
Chongqing official media suddenly reported on November 3 that Ren Xuefeng ""was passed away due to illness recently."" Hong Kong's ""Sing Tao Daily"" reported that Ren Xuefeng had fallen from the building and missed the Fourth Plenary Session.
According to the net news, Ren Xuefeng went to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, which was interviewed by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and involved a P2P project in Guangzhou. On October 31, I jumped off the 7th floor of Jingxi Hotel. Wu Cunrong, the deputy mayor of Chongqing, stayed in Beijing to deal with the aftermath.
A photo of the obituary was sent out at the same time, or the above message was confirmed from the side. The obituary showed that Ren Xuefeng died on October 31, and the farewell ceremony was held at the Beijing Changping Funeral Parlour. This shows that the official Chongqing officially delayed the death of the three-day death, and the issue of the farewell ceremony was not routinely held in the CCP Cemetery Babaoshan.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee was held in Beijing Jingxi Hotel from October 28th to 31st. If the above news is true, Ren Xuefeng may be under house arrest investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection at the Jingxi Hotel and desperately commit suicide on the day of the Fourth Plenary Session.
The Fourth Plenary Session is considered to be overshadowed by the infighting. The outside world has said that the authorities may lay a ""big tiger"" before the meeting to intimidate political enemies. Although there is no ""big tiger"" in the end, if you win a vice-level ""tiger"" on the spot during the meeting, I believe that the shocking effect is not small.
According to Hong Kong media reports, in July 2017, Sun Zhengcai, then secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, was also placed in the Jingxi Hotel during his participation in the National Financial Work Conference. Sun Zhengcai was accused of the designated successor of the Jiang Zemin faction and conspiracy to condemn.
When Ren Xuefeng was glued to the US-China trade negotiations in July last year, he was also passed down to replace Xi Jinping’s confidant Liu He, leading the US-China negotiations. The result was that in October of that year, Ren Xuefeng was transferred to the deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee from the position of the deputy secretary of the CPC Guangdong and the secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, and was accused of being disguised as an eunuch.
Ren Xuefeng began his career in Tianjin and served as deputy mayor of Tianjin. He also assisted senior officials of Zhang Jiangli, Sun Chunlan and Huang Xingguo in Tianjin. Some analysts also believe that Ren Xuefeng died in the CCP's ""route dispute"". He was born in an economic bureaucrat and may be dissatisfied with the authorities' ""political guidance of the economy.""
