      <h1>Jurgen Klopp brands Divock Origi a 'Liverpool legend' ahead of Genk clash</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool boss was quick to hail Divock Origi when asked about former Genk stars Kevin De Bruyne and Kalidou Koulibaly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:28:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Harris</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> has described <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/divock-origi">Divock Origi</a> as a “ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend”.</p>
      <p>Origi wrote his name into Anfield folklore by scoring the crucial goal as the Reds produced one of the greatest shocks in Champions League history to secure a 4-3 aggregate win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in last season’s semi-finals.</p>
      <p>He followed that up by netting in the final as Liverpool beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> to lift their sixth European crown.</p>
      <p>Origi has failed to nail down a regular place in the team since Klopp took charge more than four years ago but his contributions are not lost on the German.</p>
      <p>When asked about the striker’s former club Genk’s illustrious track record of former players including Kevin De Bruyne and Kalidou Koulibaly, Klopp said: “Divock Origi too, don’t forget him.</p>

      <p>“Liverpool legend, he’s quite famous here.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool host Genk on Tuesday evening in their fourth match of the Champions League group stage.</p>
      <p>The Reds are overwhelming favourites to pick up all three points so Klopp could shuffle his pack to cope with their jam-packed fixture list, with title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> next up in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We will hopefully have a couple of fresh legs in,” he said at his pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear that we want that, but it’s not like we will do so many changes that you cannot recognise our team anymore and think ‘who is that?’.</p>
      <p>“No, this period was absolutely OK because we made changes against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , we had to, then we played Aston Villa, now we have to look a little bit at what we do tomorrow night. But then we have enough time to prepare for City.”</p>
