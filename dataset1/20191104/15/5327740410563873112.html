      <p>Two people have died and another has been seriously hurt in a crash that sent one vehicle tumbling down a slope into a lake east of Vancouver.</p>
      <p>RCMP from the Upper Fraser Valley detachment say they were alerted at around 10 a.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>They say the vehicle could have veered down the steep slope into Harrison Lake on Saturday night or early Sunday.</p>
      <p>The only survivor was already out of the partially submerged SUV and was airlifted to hospital.</p>
      <p>An RCMP dive team is expected to return to the scene and Mounties say more information could be released later.</p>
      <p>The crash happened around the 14 kilometre marker of the Harrison East Forest Service Road, about 160 kilometres east of Vancouver, near a popular campsite.</p>
