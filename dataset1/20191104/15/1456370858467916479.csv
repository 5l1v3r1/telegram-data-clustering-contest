John Oliver Takes On Fucked Up Voting Machines In The Way Only He Can
04 Nov 2019, 15:32 by Mike Masnick
At Techdirt, we've been writing about the problems of electronic voting for just about our entire existence. I believe the first time we wrote about the problematic nature of electronic voting was in June of the year 2000, a few months before the controversy over ""hanging chads"" in the 2000 election in Florida. Over the years, we've continued to write about electronic voting and its myriad problems dozens upon dozens of times -- and to this day I remain amazed at how little companies and election officials have taken this space seriously. Part of the issue is that there is no easy solution. There isn't a ""good"" solution, there are only options that are ""less bad"" than others. The problem is that many places use solutions that are obviously bad when there are at least better options on the table.
So it's great to see John Oliver step in and explain the problems with voting machines in a way that only he can:



If you've followed this space for some time (as, apparently, we have), you won't find much that's surprising in the piece, but it does such a good job of highlighting just how ridiculous the discussion currently is around voting machines, and how little politicians and voting machine companies seem inclined to do anything about it all.
