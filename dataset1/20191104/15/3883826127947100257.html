        <b>A school parrot has celebrated its 70th birthday with a special party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The septuagenarian songbird named Sim, was sung happy birthday by the choir at the Rouge Bouillon School in St Helier, Jersey, and received a cake that was edible to both humans and birds.</p>
      <p>The brightly coloured Amazon parrot has been the school's pet since 1988. In 1991 Sim survived a fire which destroyed part of the building.</p>
      <p>Students help with his care, feeding him and cleaning his cage daily.</p>
      <p>Sim is a particularly long-lived member of his species, with most Amazon parrots not living much beyond 50.</p>
      <p>He was rehomed at the school after living in a toy shop which was forced to close.</p>

      <p>One student said Sim was a great companion to spend time with if you were feeling lonely.</p>
      <p>Deputy head teacher Jess Doyle described the ageing parrot as having become a "really big part of the school" during her 30 years in education.</p>
      <p>She said: "When we have new children arrive at the school who may not speak English, we take them to go see him and he makes them feel very welcome."</p>
      <p>She added that there must be "thousands of people" across the island with fond memories of Sim.</p>
