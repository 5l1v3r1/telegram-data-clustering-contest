      <p>Robbers stole thousands of pounds worth of stock after a jeweller was hit with a hammer, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the gang fled when the victim managed to activate a panic alarm at the shop in Ballyclare, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>New details emerged as one of the men accused of carrying out the raid on October 3 was refused bail.</p>
      <p>Jason Robert Paul, 30, of Lyndhurst View Avenue in Belfast, faces charges of robbery, arson, common assault, criminal damage and possessing an offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>Crown lawyer Conor Maguire said four men entered the jewellery store in the Mill Road area, one wielding a hammer he used to smash glass cabinets.</p>
      <p>A woman working in the shop was struck on the wrist with the hammer and shoved over, according to the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>One of the men pinned her to the ground with his foot while the display units were smashed, showering her in glass fragments.</p>
      <p>"The four males exited when the injured party was able to get access to a panic alarm she had on the premises," Mr Maguire submitted.</p>
      <p>He told the court "considerable" damage was caused to the shop during the heist.</p>
      <p>The barrister also disclosed: "One of the items stolen was a Â£2,700 engagement ring. These were items of relatively high value."</p>
      <p>Police arrived at the scene and chased three men across fields, arresting Paul and two co-accused.</p>
      <p>Another two suspects were detained later, close to the scene of an alleged attempt to set fire to a car used by the gang.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Michael Boyd argued that Paul should not be treated different than a co-accused already released from custody.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice McAlinden refused bail.</p>
