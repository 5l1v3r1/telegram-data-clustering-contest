FKA Twigs is readying the release of a new project which is set to arrive later this week but she isn't letting the week pass without a bit of a taste test. The experimental pop artist is back with her new single, ""sad day"" which marks the final single before the release of MAGDALENE. Her new song follows the release of the Future-assisted, ""holy terrain,"" ""cellophane,"" and ""home with you.""
According to Pitchfork, FKA Twigs is gearing up to drop an ""ambitious visual collaboration with Emmy-nominated Atlanta director Hiro Murai to accompany ‘sad day.'"" The music video will mark Hiro Murai's first since Childish Gambino's groundbreaking, ""This Is America."" Keep your eyes peeled for that and FKA Twigs' MAGDALENE which arrives this Friday, Nov. 8th.
Quotable LyricsTake a chance on all the things you can't seeMake a wish on all that lives within theeIf you're foolishly in love with me
