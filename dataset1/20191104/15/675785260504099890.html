      <p>A hero dog who was sent into Grenfell Tower to help the fire investigation has died.</p>
      <p>The cocker spaniel, named Murphy, attended hundreds of incidents.</p>
      <p>He searched the West London tower block for accelerants in the aftermath of the 2017 blaze, which claimed more than 70 lives.</p>
      <p>Pictures of Murphy, who was seven when he died, show him wearing specialist boots for the daunting task.</p>
      <p>In a statement the London Fire Brigade said: "We are very sad to learn that our retired fire investigation dog Murphy passed away after a short unexpected illness yesterday."</p>

      <p>Owner Mick Boyle, a retired brigade dog handler, said: "He was born to be a fire dog and loved every minute of it."</p>
      <p>Murphy retired from active duty along with fellow canine investigator Roscoe, then 13, when Mr Boyle hung up his boots in August 2017.</p>
      <p>He had joined the brigade in 2013.</p>
      <p>At the time Mr Boyle <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/hero-grenfell-fire-dog-murphy-hangs-up-his-buster-boots-a3608976.html">told the Evening Standard</a> : "The dogs are all about keeping the people of London safe and they have been an exceptional success.</p>

      <p>"Every time I work with them and they find something it gives me immense satisfaction and I'm always amazed.</p>
      <p>"I never ever get tired of it when they do find something. I've always had pride in my two dogs."</p>
      <p>There were no traces of an external accelerant, such as petrol, at Grenfell Tower.</p>
      <p>The blaze caused 72 deaths, and hundreds of firefighters were called to the fire, which broke out on June 14, 2017.</p>
