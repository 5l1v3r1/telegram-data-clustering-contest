      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/egypt.html">Egypt</a>'s security forces have killed 83 suspected fighters in operations in central and North <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/sinai-peninsula.html">Sinai</a> over the past month, the military said on Monday.</p>
      <p>It also said 61 criminal suspects were detained and it found and detonated 376 explosive devices during the period, which it dated from September 28.</p>
      <p>One officer and two soldiers died or were wounded, it added. The military did not say what armed groups those killed belonged to.</p>
      <p>Conflict in the Sinai escalated after then-president <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohamed-morsi.html">Mohamed Morsi</a> of the Muslim Brotherhood was toppled by the military in 2013.</p>
      <p>In late 2017, North Sinai was the scene of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/sinai-mosque-massacre-171124200523928.html">deadliest attack</a> in Egypt's modern history when fighters killed more than 300 worshippers at a mosque, without any group claiming responsibility.</p>
      <p>In February 2018, the army launched a military operation aimed at defeating Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) or related armed groups in the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
      <h3>Escalating violence</h3>
      <p>Hundreds of fighters and dozens of soldiers have been killed since the start of the offensive, according to the armed forces.</p>
      <p>Access to North Sinai has been restricted for years, making it difficult to independently verify what is happening on the ground.</p>
      <p>In a 134-page <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/28/if-you-are-afraid-your-lives-leave-sinai/egyptian-security-forces-and-isis">report</a> published in May, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Egyptian security forces of committing widespread abuse against civilians, some of which amounted to war crimes, it said.</p>
      <p>The report titled, If You Are Afraid for Your Lives, Leave Sinai!, documented arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, extrajudicial killings, forced evictions, and possibly unlawful air-and-ground attacks against civilians.</p>
      <p>According to the report, armed groups also committed horrific crimes, including kidnapping and torture of residents, some of whom were killed, the New York-based watchdog said. They also killed captured members of the security forces, HRW said.</p>
      <p>Egypt's ISIL affiliate, the Sinai Province, has sworn allegiance to the new leader named by the group following the death of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi.html">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>, it said on Telegram on Saturday.</p>
