Apple Deprecating Legacy Binaries for Push Notification Service on November 2020, Recommends Developers Update Soon
04 Nov 2019, 15:30 by Juli Clover



Apple today sent out a notice to developers urging those that continue to send push notifications with the legacy binary protocol to update to the HTTP/2-based APNs (Apple Push Notification service) Provider API as soon as possible. Apple says that developers will be able to take advantage of features like authentication with a JSON Web Token, improved error messaging, and per-notification feedback. More information on the Apple Push Notification service Provider API can be found on Apple's website. Apple's Push Notification service will no longer support the legacy binary protocol starting in November 2020, so developers that continue to use the older protocol will need to update before that date.
