      <p>Bandai Namco's anime RPG <i>Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time</i> seems to be going through something of a digital de-listing, as the game is quietly being pulled from various territories, 18 months after its initial western release.<br/><br/>The adventures of Akko, Sucy and Lotte can no longer be found on the EU PSN or Steam dashboards, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/710470/Little_Witch_Academia_Chamber_of_Time/">the latter replacing its purchase page</a> with a message reading "At the request of the publisher,<i> Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time</i> is no longer available for sale on Steam". Although no official word has been given for the vanishing act, the 18-month time-frame suggests a possible licence expiration.<br/><br/>While <i>Little Witch Academia</i> is a smart anime series, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-little-witch-academia-chamber-of-time-502931.phtml"><i>Chamber of Time</i> was a very poor adaptation.</a> While it captured the character and spirit of the mystical show perfectly, it was a crushing bore of a video game, with <i>exhausting</i> side-quests, a wildly confusing map, and frustratingly broken combat. The <i>LWA</i> brand is perfectly suited to video game escapades, so here's hoping that Akko and pals one day get the adventure they deserve.</p>
