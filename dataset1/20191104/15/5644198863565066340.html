      <p>BANGKOK: US President Donald Trump has invited ASEAN leaders to a "special summit" in the United States next year, after skipping the ongoing meet in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>Robert O'Brien, the White House national security adviser, read a message from Trump at a US-ASEAN meeting on Monday (Nov 4) on the sidelines of the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>

      <p>"I would also like to take this opportunity to offer an invitation to the leaders of ASEAN to join me in the United States for a special summit, meeting at a time of mutual convenience in the first quarter of 2020," O'Brien said, reading Trump's letter.</p>
      <p>Trump's letter also said that a summit in the US would provide "an excellent opportunity" for leaders to "broaden and deepen our cooperation on matters of great importance".</p>
      <p>Trump has skipped the ASEAN-US summit for the past two years, sending Vice-President Mike Pence in 2018.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Monday's sparsely attended address from O'Brien stood in contrast to earlier ASEAN meetings, which had all been attended by most heads of state.</p>
      <p>At this year's summit, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was the highest-ranking delegation official, prompting the 10-member grouping to downgrade the summit to a "troika" attended only by top leaders from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
      <p>"It's not appropriate for ASEAN to send leaders when the US representation is not on parity," one diplomat in Bangkok told AFP.</p>
      <p>Another diplomat said: "It's not a boycott, it's just that other leaders have other meetings to attend to."</p>
      <p>Ross insisted Monday that the US remained "extremely engaged" with Asia despite Trump skipping the summit.</p>
      <p>Trump is accused of retreating from the region after pulling out of a major Asia-Pacific trade pact almost immediately after taking office.</p>
      <p>But Ross pushed back against criticism that America has turned its back on Asian allies.</p>
      <p>"The Trump administration is extremely engaged in and fully committed to this region," he said at a business forum on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting Monday.</p>
      <p>"We continue to negotiate trade deals with countries in this region."</p>
      <p>
        <b>TRADE DISPUTES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Trump has railed against countries in Asia for building massive trade surpluses with the US and has vowed to pursue bilateral deals in the region instead of sprawling pacts.</p>
      <p>He signed a free trade agreement with Japan earlier this year and also renegotiated the terms of a trade deal with South Korea.</p>
      <p>Soon after he took office, Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - which would have been the world's biggest free trade pact - calling the deal a "job killer".</p>
      <p>It has since been reborn as a watered-down deal without the US, and another China-backed trade pact is now set to be the world's largest when it is signed.</p>
      <p>The 16-nation <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/southeast-asian-leaders-meet-us-china-trade-war-asean-summit-12057538">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)</a>, which could be finalised next year, includes 30 per cent of global GDP and half of the world's people.</p>

      <p>It includes all 10 ASEAN states plus China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - notably excluding the US.</p>
      <p>Washington remains locked in its bruising trade war with China, with both slides slapping tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods.</p>
      <p>Ross said an agreement to row back some of those tariffs was "very far along".</p>
      <p>Trump has said the deal could be soon signed with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, possibly in the US state of Iowa.</p>
      <p>Trump attended the ASEAN summit in the Philippines in 2017 while Pence appeared last year.</p>
      <p>A senior White House official denied that Washington had snubbed this year's event, saying Trump and Pence are unavailable because they are "very engaged in campaigning" for a string of governors' races.</p>
