      <p>The company also said its global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst will leave McDonald’s, but did not provide any further details.</p>
      <p>Fairhurst has been with the company for nearly 15 years, holding key human resources positions, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast-food chain, said it had dismissed Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.</p>
      <p>"In consideration for (severance) benefits, Mr. Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favor of the company," McDonald's said in regulatory filing. (<a href="http://bit.ly/2WOhfaI">bit.ly/2WOhfaI</a>)</p>
      <p>Easterbrook received total compensation of $15.88 million in 2018, according to a filing.</p>
      <p>He would get about $675,000 in severance after six months, based on his 2018 base salary of $1.35 million. Easterbrook is also eligible for 18 months of health benefits, the filing showed.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s said Easterbrook’s separation agreement contained a two-year post-termination non-competition clause, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements.</p>
      <p>New CEO Chris Kempczinski will have an annual base salary of $1.25 million, with a target-based bonus of 170% of his annual base salary, McDonald’s said.</p>
      <p>The Chicago-based company’s shares fell over 3% on Monday.</p>
