Medtem ko britanski mediji vsakodnevno poročajo o Meghan Markle in njenem žalostnem življenju na britanskem dvoru, mnoge še vedno zanima življenje njene pokojne tašče. Princesa Diana še ni potonila v pozabo, čeprav je že več kot 20 let pokojna (umrla v prometni nesreči 31. avgusta 1997). The Daily Mirror piše, da je v času druge nosečnosti vedela, da s Charlesom pričakujeta dečka, a ga s tem ni seznanila. Princ si je menda močno želel deklico, zato mu Diana ni povedala, da pričakujeta še drugega sina.»Na ultrazvoku je videla, da bo dobila dečka. Charles si je želel dva otroka, dečka in deklico, zato mu Diana ni povedala za drugega sina. Zelo je bil razočaran, ko se je rodil Harry, in tega sploh ni skrival,« je povedal kraljevi biograf Andrew Morton. Menda je bil Charles tudi razočaran, ko je videl, da ima otrok oranžne lase. Ko so Harryja krstili, je menda potožil tudi Dianini materi, da si je sicer bolj želel, da bi z Diano povila hčerko.

She never told Prince Diana this Prince
When Harry was born, Charles was apparently very disappointed.

While the British media reports daily about Meghan Markle and her sad life in the British court, many are still interested in the life of her late mother-in-law. Princess Diana has not yet sunk into oblivion, though she has been deceased for more than 20 years (died in a car accident on August 31, 1997). The Daily Mirror writes that she knew at the time of her second pregnancy that she was expecting a boy with Charles, but did not inform him. The prince had a strong desire for the girl, so Diana did not tell him that they were expecting another son. Charles wanted two children, a boy and a girl, so Diana did not tell him about her second son. He was very disappointed when Harry was born, and he didn't hide it at all, ""said King's biographer Andrew Morton. Apparently Charles was also disappointed to see that the baby had orange hair. When Harry was baptized, he allegedly complained to Diana's mother that he wanted to bring her daughter with Diana.
