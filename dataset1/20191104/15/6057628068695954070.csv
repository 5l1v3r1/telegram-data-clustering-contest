Iraq protests forcing schools and schools to close
04 Nov 2019, 15:39 by Ahmed Abba

Protesters in Iraq have taken to the streets of Baghdad, shutting down streets blocking students from going to school and restricting staff to their offices.

Protesters expressing concern over corruption and unemployment have rejected any offer of withdrawal and the pursuit of security forces.
Reports say that after Baghdad, protests were held in Diwaniyah.
The protests began on October 1, in which anti-corruption and anti-Iraq protests rallied around the Iraqi capital, but the protesters rallied to protest, including many of them dead.
Since the protests began, it has grown exponentially, with the support of students and business groups, who have announced a non-violent revolution.
In Baghdad, university students used cars to cut off neighborhoods on Monday, as police patrolled them.
In the southern city of Diwaniyah, a piece of cloth hangs on the door of the district shelf with the inscription, ""The nation is ordered to close"".
Public schools are closed in Baghdad, and many other cities in the south.
Also in the oil-rich Basramai city, public schools are closed for the first time since the protests began in October.
