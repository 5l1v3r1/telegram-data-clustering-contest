      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) â€” Cyprus' president pledged on Monday to revoke any of his island republic's passports found to have been "mistakenly" granted to wealthy overseas investors under a controversial cash-for-citizenship program.</p>
      <p>Nicos Anastasiades said errors may have been made in granting such so-called "golden passports" under an earlier, laxer version of the program.</p>
      <p>"We have to admit mistakes" over some "blatant" instances where passports shouldn't have been issued, Anastasiades told reporters. He said there could be "perhaps 10-15" such cases of investors whom vetting had failed to identify as ineligible.</p>
      <p>The allure of a Cypriot passport, particularly to wealthy individuals from countries outside the European Union, is that holders also become EU citizens and can travel and work freely within the bloc.</p>
      <p>"Citizenship will be taken away from anyone who received it in violation of the strict criteria that are required, full stop," Anastasiades said. "And as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>His statements came following media reports that some program beneficiaries may have been implicated in money-laundering or were linked to authoritarian governments.</p>
      <p>Nearly 4,000 passports have been issued to investors since the program was launched following a 2013 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The scheme, which requires investments of at least 2 million euros ($2.2 million) in real estate or in a Cyprus-based business, has so far generated some 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion). Anastasiades said that money has helped the country rebound strongly from near-bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>The government launched an investigation last month into all investors who received passports before eligibility rules and vetting procedures were first tightened in 2018.</p>
      <p>Even more stringent vetting was enacted earlier this year. It included a requirement that investors already hold a visa permitting them to visit the EU.</p>
      <p>That came after the EU issued a report in January warning Cyprus and other countries to beef up vetting procedures amid concerns that third-country nationals were exploiting the program to launder money and flout tax laws.</p>
