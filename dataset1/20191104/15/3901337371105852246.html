      <h1>A Midnight Sack – How the Football World Reacted to Benni's City Axing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:02:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">SL Social</a></address>
      <p>In news that shocked the local football fraternity, Cape Town City announced that they had parted ways with Benni McCarthy this week. With this quickly becoming a trending topic online, have you seen some of the reactions?</p>
      <p>Spending two successful years with the Mother City outfit, Benni led City to a Nedbank Cup triumph and a Telkom Knockout runners-up medal during his time with the club.</p>
      <p>With just two wins in 18 games this season, though, the plug was pulled on his tenure with the Citizens, and an announcement was made to that effect, albeit at an unconventional time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>City took to their social media platforms just after midnight this past Sunday to make the news official, while Benni responded via his own social media handles a little while later.</p>
      <p>As expected, Benni's name was soon spotted on the "Trending" tab on Twitter as many local football fans reacted to the sacking.</p>
