      <p><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/farming_simulator_20"><b>Farming Simulator 20</b></a> is launching on Nintendo Switch next month and to celebrate, Focus Home Interactive has shared a new <b>Pokémon</b>-inspired trailer.</p>
      <p>Actually arriving on both Switch and mobile devices on the same day, the series is said to have grown with lots of new gameplay additions including new machinery and crops with cotton and oats, as well as a whole new North American environment to explore and develop as you like. There's also the addition of John Deere, said to be the largest agriculture machinery company in the world, and you can now ride and tend to horses.</p>
      <p>A press release for the game says that you'll be able to enjoy more than 100 faithfully reproduced farming vehicles and tools, some of which you can see in the new trailer above. As you'll also see in the video, the release date is now confirmed to be 3rd December.</p>
