Thousands of visitors are expected at West Dunbartonshire Council’s free display at Levengrove Park tonight.
The 20-minute shows will feature a range of fireworks, including comets, mines, spinners, hummers, whistles, strobes and dragon’s eggs, and will light up the sky in an array of colours.
The event begins at 7pm and finish at 9pm.
Along with the main event, there will be family activities and stalls selling hot food.
Another fireworks display will take place in Dalmuir tomorrow night.
 
Visitors are advised to arrive in plenty of time and, if possible, walk to the event or use public transport as many of the streets around the parks will have parking restrictions in place.
People are being urged not to bring their own fireworks or sparklers as these can present a safety issue within large crowds, and are also advised to leave pets at home.
Around 5,000 spectators are expected to attend each event.
Visitors are asked to arrive at the events in plenty of time to avoid disappointment, adhere to parking restrictions in and around the venues and follow advice from the stewards at all times.
