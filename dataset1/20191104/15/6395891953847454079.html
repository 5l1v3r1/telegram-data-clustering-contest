      <p><b>NEWPORT, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A Rhode Island man and his wife have been arrested for locking their 2-year-old son in a bedroom and leaving him home alone.</p>
      <p>The Newport Daily News reports 37-year-old Lazaro Shemeley and 25-year-old Leah Shemeley were charged with cruelty or neglect of a child on Friday.</p>
      <p>A judge issued both a no-contact with the child order.</p>
      <p>Lazaro Shemeley was initially arrested on a domestic disorderly conduct charge. Leah Shemeley reportedly left the couple's child at home to attend her husband's arraignment Friday morning.</p>
      <p>She told police she left the child with a babysitter, but authorities received a call about a crying child apparently left at home.</p>
      <p>Leah Shemeley said she'd return home immediately after learning police were with her child.</p>
      <p>It couldn't be immediately determined if the couple had a lawyer.</p>
