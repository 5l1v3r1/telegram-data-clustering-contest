      <p>Cape Town - Actress Jessica Nkosi and actor TK Dlamini had a very public breakup in August after Jessica accused TK of cheating on her.</p>
      <p>Now, the couple seems to be on good terms again after a video of them dancing together surfaced on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Throughout their relationship, the pair kept their relationship mostly under wraps, making their relationship public with the arrival of their first child together in October 2018.</p>

      <p>In August, the actress told <b>Channel24 </b>that she ended her relationship with TK.</p>
      <p>"I have made the decision to end our relationship. I am no longer with the father of my child," she said.</p>
      <p>Rumours of TK's alleged infidelity first made headlines in July, when TK attended the Durban July solo.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was quick to put out the rumours, telling <i><b>Move!</b></i>, "There's no such, it's all hogwash. We're together. We've never broken up."</p>
      <p>Now, two months after they split, TK posted a video him and Jessica Nkosi enjoying themselves at a concert on his WhatsApp story.</p>
      <p>The story was then reposted onto to Twitter.</p>
