Before Death Stranding, game developer Hideo Kojima made a different game about delivering packages: Penguin Adventure.
Kojima was the assistant designer on Penguin Adventure when it released in 1986 for MSX, according to an article by MSPoweruser. The game is a sequel to Antarctic Adventure and was the first game that Kojima was able to work on at Konami. Penguin Adventure follows the story of Penta, a penguin who has to bring home a golden apple to cure the penguin princess. While this story isn’t as meaningful as Death Stranding’s, they both focus on an earnest guy just trying to make some deliveries.

For a game made over 30 years ago, Penguin Adventure had some in-depth features, like alternative endings, something Kojima would end up using again in his later works.
Penguin Adventure still lives and has been re-released as recently as 2014 in Japan for Windows. Unfortunately Penguin Adventure hasn’t been brought stateside ever. It released in Europe in 1987, though it never quite made it to America. While it might be hard to find and play now, you can check out a playthrough below.
