      <p>FKA Twigs is readying the release of a new project which is set to arrive later this week but she isn't letting the week pass without a bit of a taste test. The experimental pop artist is back with her new single, "sad day" which marks the final single before the release of <i>MAGDALENE.</i> Her new song follows the release of the <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Future/profile">Future</a>-assisted, "holy terrain," "cellophane," and "home with you."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/fka-twigs-interview/">Pitchfork,</a> FKA Twigs is gearing up to drop an "ambitious visual collaboration with Emmy-nominated <i>Atlanta</i> director Hiro Murai to accompany â€˜sad day.'" The music video will mark Hiro Murai's first since <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/childishgambino/profile">Childish Gambino</a>'s groundbreaking, "This Is America." Keep your eyes peeled for that and FKA Twigs' <i>MAGDALENE</i> which arrives this Friday, Nov. 8th.</p>
