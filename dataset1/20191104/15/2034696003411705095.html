      <p>Speaking about the reveal, Irons told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/watchmen-jeremy-irons-as-adrian-veidt-ozymandias-explained-1251668"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>: “Uniforms give you power. “I think that’s why people put them on. Masks give you even more power. It’s interesting that these superheroes always wear masks and costumes; it gives them a feeling of strength and allows them to do more than if they weren’t wearing them.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s the same with the military, a marine, or a police officer. I think that’s part of what Damon [Lindelhof] is exploring.”</p>

      <p>He added: “I thought [Veidt] was fascinating, off the wall, bizarre and thoroughly mesmeric to play. To play enigmas, I have always enjoyed.”</p>
      <p>Showrunner Lindelhof added of bringing back the classic character: “Veidt was essential, unless he died in the interim [between the comics and the show], which would have been very sad — and we’re obviously dealing with a world that believes he’s dead; and he may or may not be, because who knows when or where this story is unfolding.”</p>
