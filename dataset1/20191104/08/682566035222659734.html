      <p>Cape Town - In an early Monday morning shocker, <b>Absa Premiership</b> side <b>Cape Town City</b> sacked head coach <b>Benni McCarthy</b>.</p>
      <p><i>"Cape Town City Football Club has terminated the employment of coach Benni McCarthy, with immediate effect following a run of performance that saw the club win two in the last 18 games," </i>the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/cape-town-city-sack-benni-mccarthy-as-head-coach-20191104">statement read that was released.</a></p>
      <p>Assistant coach Vasili Manousakis will keep an eye on the squad on an interim basis as the club finalises the first team's new mentor.</p>
      <p>McCarthy arrived at City in June 2017 and claimed a runners-up MTN8 medal in 2017. The following year, the former Bafana Bafana striker guided the Citizens side to the 2018 MTN8 title against SuperSport United in the final.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old has never been shy in sharing his views and over the past two years at the club, he certainly has gotten a lot off his chest during his pre- and post-match interviews.</p>
      <p>The following are 12 memorable quotes from the South African soccer legend during his time as head coach of Cape Town City:</p>
