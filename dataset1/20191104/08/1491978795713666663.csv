Donald Trump says he would like to see his 'friends' Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage form a pact to secure a pro-Brexit parliamentary majority in the general election. Farage announced on Sunday he would not stand in next month's election, choosing instead to campaign nationally against Johnson's Brexit deal. His Brexit party will stand in every seat on 12 December, which has been seen as a potential setback to Johnson.
The president said Johnson was 'the right man for the time ... He's tough, he's smart and I think he's going to do something.'
'What I'd like to see is for Nigel and Boris to come together,' he added. 'I think that's a possibility.'
