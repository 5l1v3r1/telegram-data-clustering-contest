毒品危害條例草案排審　擴大沒收犯罪所得刻不容緩
04 Nov 2019, 08:12 by 林俊宏
立法院今天排審毒品危害防制條例草案，針對毒品犯罪所得擴大沒收，司法界及學界早已呼籲要及早修法補漏洞，法務部也早已針對「引進擴大沒收制度」及「加快新興毒品列管速度」提出修法意見，惟有立委盡速修訂新制，才能有效打擊毒品犯罪。
「暴利」是引誘毒品犯罪的主因之一，且毒品犯罪可能伴隨著其他違法行為，擴大沒收制度若引進，毒販只要無法舉證、解釋家中所得是正當來源，司法體系就能依法沒收該筆鉅款。
由於現行制度，除非法院判決併科罰金，否則只能把從毒販家中查扣的鉅款發還給被告，對於大盤毒梟而言，根本是資助繼續販毒！法界人士說，事實上，毒販之所以有恃無恐，就是因為判決離入監執行還早得很，如果羈押交保，以後再逃亡也來得及，最重要的是手上有錢買貨，繼續交易就可以獲取巨額暴利。
以德國《刑法》「擴大沒收」為例，即是藉此來解決販毒問題日益惡化，法律上既然認定被告是慣性犯罪，類似的犯罪所得也要剝奪。雖然我國在《洗錢防制法》中，首度納入「擴大沒收」新制，卻對於萬國公罪的販毒行為沒有設立相同的處罰機制。
此外，新興毒品更新快速，台灣列管速度卻不夠積極，法務部希望能修正「在一個毒品審議會程序中，把結構、效果、危害性相類似新興毒品一次列管，加快列管速度」。如此一來，可大幅提升列管效率，讓新興毒品無所遁形。
政府口口聲聲打擊毒品，若要認真緝毒，就要建立完備法制，惟有在《毒品危害防制條例》中新增「擴大沒收」及「加快新興毒品列管速度」，如此才能徹底斷絕毒販金流，有效遏止毒品流竄。

The drug hazard bill is being reviewed. It is imperative to expand the confiscation of criminal proceeds.
04 Nov 2019, 08:12 by Lin Junhong
The Legislative Yuan today has reviewed the Drug Hazard Prevention and Control Bill to expand the confiscation of the proceeds of drug offences. The judicial and academic circles have already called for early amendments to fill in loopholes. The Law Department has already targeted the ""improvement of the confiscation system"" and ""accelerating the speed of emerging drug trafficking"". It is proposed to amend the law. Only when the legislators revise the new system as soon as possible can the drug crime be effectively combated.
""profiteering"" is one of the main causes of drug-related crimes, and drug-related crimes may be accompanied by other illegal acts. If the confiscation system is introduced, if the drug dealer cannot prove and explain that the income at home is a legitimate source, the judicial system can confiscate the huge sum of money according to law. .
Due to the current system, unless the court decides to impose fines, the huge amount seized from the drug dealers can only be returned to the defendant. For the drug market, it is funded to continue drug trafficking! The legal profession said that in fact, the reason why drug dealers are fearless is because the judgment has been very early in the execution of the prison. If you are in custody, you will have to flee later. The most important thing is to have money to buy goods and continue to trade. Huge profits.
Take the German ""Criminal Law"" ""enlarged confiscation"" as an example to solve the problem of deteriorating drug trafficking. Since the law has determined that the defendant is an inertial crime, similar criminal proceeds should also be deprived. Although China has included the new system of ""expanding and confiscation"" for the first time in the ""Money Laundering Prevention and Control Law"", it has not established the same punishment mechanism for drug trafficking in the United States.
In addition, the rapid update of new drugs and the slow pace of Taiwan's custody are not positive. The Ministry of Justice hopes to amend ""in a drug review process, the structure, effects, and hazards are similar to those of emerging drugs, and speed up the custody."" In this way, the efficiency of the tube can be greatly improved, and the emerging drugs can be seen indiscriminately.
The Government has been vocally fighting drugs. If we are to seriously detoxify, we must establish a complete legal system. Only by adding ""enlarged confiscation"" and ""accelerating the speed of emerging drug trafficking"" in the Drug Hazard Prevention and Control Ordinance can we completely sever the drug traffic. Effectively curb drug hooliganism.
