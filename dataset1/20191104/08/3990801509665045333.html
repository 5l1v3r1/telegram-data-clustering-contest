      <h1>Notorious anon forum 8chan is back online as 8kun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:00:06+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ivanmehta/" target="_blank">Ivan Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Notorious forum 8chan, which is associated with numerous mass shootings, is back with a new name called 8kun.</p>
      <p>The site, a home for far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, allows users to post anonymously and has famously hosted manifestos for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kxde9/how-8chan-was-born-and-became-the-worst-place-on-the-internet">Christchurch shooting in New Zealand</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/09/new-zealand-telco-bans-8chan-as-chief-censor-calls-it-racist-killers-platform-of-choice">El Paso shooting</a> in the US.  During the Christchurch shooting the terrorist live-streamed the incident on the site, and many community members praised his ‘efforts.’</p>
      <p>After these incidents, The site’s founder, Fredrik Bennon repeatedly asked for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/technology/8chan-shooting-manifesto.html">8chan’s ban</a>. After El Paso shooting, cloud hosting services including <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/08/05/8chan-booted-out-by-cloudflare-after-el-paso-shooting/">Cloudflare and Epik banned the site.</a></p>
      <p>In October, 8chan’s administrator and current owner, Jim Watkins, posted a new logo under the 8kun brand. <a href="https://twitter.com/HW_BEAT_THAT/status/1181131266793410561">Brennan has opposed the site’s return</a> saying the admins are incompetent. </p>
      <p>Prior to that, during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850791/8chan-hate-speech-delete-jim-watkins-infinitechan-el-paso-shooting-racist-white-supremacist">his testimony before the US Congress in September</a>, Watkins said the racist content is only posted by “a small minority of users” and that he “has no intention of deleting constitutionally protected hate speech.”</p>

      <p>The site has famously hosted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon">QAnon</a>, a conspiracy theorist, who has falsely accused several Hollywood stars and Democratic politicians of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory">a child sex-trafficking scandal</a>.</p>
      <p>The new site doesn’t have the popular /pol/ (politics) board, where most political theories originate from (yet).</p>
      <p>If 8chan was of any indication, 8kun will be no different in spreading hate speech and spewing propaganda. The site’s current host, a Russia-based company called <a href="https://vdsina.ru/">VDSina</a>, should look at its history and ban it before it causes any harm.</p>
