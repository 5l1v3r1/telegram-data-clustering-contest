      <h1>Mikel Arteta among candidates as Arsenal eye up replacements for under-fire Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>The former Rangers midfielder has a growing reputation as a coach and could get his first managerial gig.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:13:28+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Mikel Arteta is among a number of candidates being looked at as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery's</a> replacement at Arsenal if the Spaniard is sacked.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star was linked with the job before Emery took over but his lack of experience as the main man seemed to count against him.</p>
      <p>But his stock continues to rise as a highly-rated right hand man of Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>His relationship with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans after his five years at the club also hold him in good stead, report <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-identify-top-managerial-targets-20805995">the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Technical director Edu and head of football Raul Sanllehi have a growing influence in the club but Josh Kroenke - son of majority shareholder Stan - wants to give Emery a bit more time.</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/juventus">Juventus</a> boss Massimo Allegri is also a candidate after being out of work since leaving the Old Lady at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Allegri was understood to be in the running for the role last time as well, but interviewed poorly and was overlooked.</p>
      <p>Arsenal don't have many other options with Patrick Vieira performing poorly at Nice while Jose Mourinho is an unlikely option due to his relationship with the supporters.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had a barbed relationship with Arsene Wenger and aimed jibes at the club in the past.</p>
      <p>Emery is under further pressure after the 1-1 draw with Wolves. They've won just two of their last nine Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Arteta spent two seasons at Ibrox, winning the Premier League and League Cup in 2003.</p>
