      <p>The City of Ocala in Florida fell victim to a business email compromise scam (BEC) that ended with redirecting over $742,000 to a bank account controlled by the fraudster(s).</p>
      <p>The swindle involved a phishing email impersonating an employee of a construction company the city is using to build a new terminal at the Ocala International Airport.</p>
      <h3>Email to the right person</h3>
      <p>It started in September when a city senior accounting specialist received an email from a counterpart at Ausley Construction further payments be sent to a different bank account than the regular one.</p>
      <p>Impersonating vendors or clients is the latest trend observed in BEC scams, and requires a lot of preparation to create a message the victim will take for genuine.</p>
      <p>Fraudsters often use malware - like spyware or remote access tools, that allows them to collect the necessary information to craft a believable email.</p>
      <p>In the case of Ocala, the criminals gave the city employee a routing number and a bank account number along with a copy of a voided check. The message came from "ausleyconstructions.com," a fake address impersonating the real one that has no 's' at the end.</p>
      <p>The sham was discovered when Ausley Construction notified the city on October 22 that an invoice submitted five days earlier had not been paid.</p>
      <p>The city had paid the invoice the day after receiving it but the money went to the fraudster's bank account, <a href="https://www.ocala.com/news/20191028/ocala-police-scammers-swiped-nearly-750000-from-city">reports</a> Ocala Star Banner.</p>
      <p>A report from the Ocala Police Department says that the full amount the city lost this way is $742,376.73. According to an earlier statement from Mayor Kent Guinn, the fraudulent account still had about $110,000 when they learned of the scam.</p>
      <h3>Email account fraud is huge</h3>
      <p>Illegal transfers from BEC fraud (also known as email account compromise) are huge. Statistics from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) this summer <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bec-scams-average-301-million-per-month-in-illegal-transfers/">reveal</a> an average monthly figure of over $300 million.</p>
      <p>The numbers may be hard to believe but they are supported by the reported incidents. In August, the city of Naples, Florida, went through the same problem, cybercriminals getting around $700,000 into their account.</p>
      <p>On October 30, one of the world's largest media corporations, Nikkei, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/media-giant-nikkei-loses-29-million-to-bec-scammers/">reported a BEC scam</a> that caused a loss of about $29 million.</p>
      <p>A member of the Toyota Group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-37-million-lost-by-toyota-boshoku-subsidiary-in-bec-scam/">announced</a> in early September that it had become a victim of the same type of fraud. The expected financial loss is over $37 million.</p>
