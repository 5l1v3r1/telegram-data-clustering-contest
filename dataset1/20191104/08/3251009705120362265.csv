Car narrowly misses hitting a scooter while overtaking [Video]


Indian roads are full of surprises, which is what also makes the roads one of the most dangerous places to be. On the public roads, be it a city road or a national highway, taking off the eyes from the roads or not paying attention for even a microsecond can result in mishaps.
This is why there are so many accidents reported from the public roads daily. Here is an incident where the driver of a Hyundai Elantra barely missed a two-wheeler rider on a Honda Activa. Who do you think should be blamed here?
The video posted by Anil Ct in a group shows a recording from a dashboard camera of a Hyundai Elantra. the location of the recording is the TCR-EKM highway in Kerala. The video shows a KSRTC bus cruising on the fast lane of the two-lane way, which is a common sight on the Indian roads.
The video further shows a Toyota Innova overtaking the bus from the left-hand side and the Hyundai Elantra blindly following the Innova to overtake the bus.



However, as soon as the Elantra moves to the left lane and starts overtaking the bus, the Innova suddenly moves to the right lane and a slow scooter rider appear out of nowhere. The Elantra barely misses hitting him by swaying to the right.
Since the Elantra was already overtaking the bus, there was very limited space and it could have ended in a tragedy. Nonetheless, the accident was barely avoided.
Slow-moving heavy vehicles can always be seen in the fastest lane, which can cause massive accidents. However, one should always be extremely careful while overtaking. The KSRTC bus was cruising on the right lane, which blocked the way ahead. The Toyota Innova moved to the left lane to overtake the bus well before time. This allowed the Innova driver to get a clear view of the road ahead.
He clearly saw that there is a scooter rider in the front and planned the overtake in such a way that he will be clear of the bus and will get enough space to go the right lane.
However, the Elantra driver did not see what is in front since the view was blocked by the KSRTC bus and the Innova. He started blindly following the Innova, which is why he did not know that there is a slow-moving scooter in front that he barely managed to miss.
incidents are quite common on the Indian roads and many of them result in fatal accidents. While overtaking, one should always check the way ahead and overtake only if it is clear and there is enough space.
It is always a good idea to wait for the clear road ahead rather than blindly following a vehicle on the roads.
Also, since it is quite difficult to get the right of way from the slow-moving heavy vehicles, overtaking from the left is something everyone does nowadays. However, whenever possible, always try to overtake from the right-hand side of a vehicle because that’s the safest thing to do.
