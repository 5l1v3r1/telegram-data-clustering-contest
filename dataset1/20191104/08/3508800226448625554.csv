死藤水與當代物質管制政策（下）：宗教全球化之下，歐美各國如何進行管制？
04 Nov 2019, 08:00 by STS多重奏


我們想讓你知道的是ayahuasca宗教團體在巴西出現較保守的宗教團體會爭奪正統性、對積極擴張的宗教團體進行批評的現象，在加拿大同屬積極擴張的宗教團體則合作爭取ayahuasca使用的權利；全球物質管制政策雖以國際公約定義物質的管制地位，但巴西與法國卻對製作ayahuasca的植物有完全不同的認定。

死藤水與當代物質管制政策（上）：巴西政府如何合法化宗教性使用？


在地二：Ayahuasca宗教全球化下的美國、荷蘭、法國、加拿大
巴西ayahuasca宗教團體於1987年在國內取得了使用ayahuasca的合法性之同時，自1980年代開始透過都市的中產階級與宗教團體的接觸，讓部分宗教團體——以UDV和Santo Daime的CEFLURIS支派最為積極―從亞馬遜叢林的邊界向巴西都市地區擴張建立支部（antana de Rose, 2018c）；此外，來自世界各地泛屬新世紀靈性運動（new age spirituality movement）的人們，在巴西接觸過ayahuasca後成為ayahuasca宗教的信徒，在回到自己的國家後成立支部，以延續宗教活動和進行宣揚，然而這些國際的宗教支部在不同的國家便面臨了不同於巴西的國家治理原則，而成為ayahuasca宗教擴展的新挑戰。

美國


UDV在1987年開始在美國發展，於1994年正式登記為宗教團體，但1999年美國海關查獲從巴西運輸的ayahuasca，聲稱因其中含有DMT屬違禁品而予以查扣。UDV起初希望透過主動舉行研討會，由各領域的專家向政府官員解說ayahuasca宗教與ayahuasca之宗教性使用以期獲得政府的許可。然而在持續的對話下未果，因此UDV透過司法程序對美國司法部、緝毒局和海關部門提告，主張行使宗教自由的權利以爭取在宗教儀式中使用ayahuasca。
美國司法部提出三項維護國家利益的理由反對UDV使用ayahuasca的宗教行為：

ayahuasca中含有的DMT將有害大眾健康與安全性。
授權UDV宗教性使用ayahuasca，存在ayahuasca流往娛樂性和商業使用的風險。
國際物質管制規約將DMT列為管制物質，因此不應違反國際規約。

2002年新墨西哥州地方法院基於美國政府無法提出充足證據證明UDV成員在儀式情境中使用ayahuasca會產生嚴重健康風險、UDV成員使用ayahuasca會顯著導致ayahuasca流向非宗教性使用，並且ayahuasca並未列入1971年的聯合國精神藥物公約管制項目，因此同意UDV提出對美國政府限制UDV使用ayahuasca的初步禁制令（Bronfman, 2011）。
美國政府在敗訴後，仍持續上訴希望限制UDV使用ayahuasca的權利但仍未果，2005年上訴至最高法院，雖然最高法院推翻先前判決中認為ayahuasca並未列入聯合國精神藥物公約管制項目的觀點，認為精神藥物公約和美國管制物質法案將DMT列為一級管制物質，因此應延伸將ayahuasca一併列入管制範圍，但基於保障宗教自由的行使權利，且依據1993年頒佈的宗教自由修復法案（Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA），當個人的宗教活動受到政府的干預，可依此法案來保障宗教活動的行使自由，並且，美國政府無法提出有力證據證明ayahuasca的宗教性使用會造成健康危害性，以及核准ayahuasca予UDV會流入非法市場的問題，因此在宗教自由和物質管制的權衡下，UDV在宗教儀式中使用ayahuasca可豁免於管制物質法案的管制範圍（Bronfman, 2011）。
值得一提的是，宗教自由修復法案的制訂在1994年已為美國印地安原住民在宗教儀式中使用含有列為一級管制物質mescaline的烏羽玉仙人掌（peyote，圖1）提供了豁免於管制物質法案管制範圍的法律基礎，因此也作為最高法院在UDV訴訟案中引用的判決先例。在UDV勝訴之後，位在奧瑞岡州的Santo Daime教會也於2008年向奧瑞岡州地方法院提出訴訟爭取使用ayahuasca的合法性，在2009年同樣獲得勝訴。

荷蘭


荷蘭雖然作為物質管制政策較為寬鬆的國家，但荷蘭最高法院在1998年裁定，原屬合法、含有psilocybin、psilocin之蕈類（圖2），若經過人工處理——包含單純的乾燥化——都將成為管制的物質，也意指人工處理的行為都屬違法行為；此原則亦適用於其他含有精神驅動物質的植物上，因此若服用ayahuasca中最常使用的Banisteriopsis caapi和Psychotria viridis之自然植物並不違法，但若將此兩種植物處理製作成ayahuasca，以及持有、使用ayahuasca，則屬違法行為。在2008年，荷蘭決定提高對psilocybin、psilocin的管制程度，將生產、販售、持有、使用未經人工處理，含有psilocybin、psilocin的蕈類也視為違法行為（van den Plas, 2011）。

Santo Daime在1995年於荷蘭正式登記為宗教團體【圖二十四】，但兩位教會領袖在1999年遭到荷蘭逮捕，指控因提供ayahuasca在宗教儀式上使用而違法。Santo Daime教會以歐洲人權公約（European Convention on Human Rights）保障宗教自由的基本權利之理由提起訴訟，以爭取使用ayahuasca的權利，檢察官則以ayahuasca作為經人工處理的產物，視同被管制的DMT因此違法作為辯護。
在訴訟過程，荷蘭的公共衛生部向國際麻醉藥品管制委員會詢問關於ayahuasca的管制狀態，國際麻醉藥品管制委員會回覆沒有任何含有DMT的植物列在聯合國精神藥物公約的管制名單之中，因此任何由含有DMT植物製作而成的製劑―包括ayahuasca―皆不在國際物質管制的範疇內（Schaepe, 2001），然而阿姆斯特丹地方法院在判決中對國際麻醉藥品管制委員會的解釋不予接受，認為ayahuasca應屬管制物質；不過阿姆斯特丹地方法院基於Santo Daime應受到歐洲人權公約的宗教自由保障，而Santo Daime提供的專家意見認可ayahuasca在宗教儀式中的使用能夠避免造成健康危害性，並且檢方無法提出充足證據證明Santo Daime宗教性使用ayahuasca會影響公共安全、公共秩序、衛生、道德和他人之權利與自由下，於2001年裁定Santo Daime勝訴，讓荷蘭成為第一個允許ayahuasca宗教團體宗教性使用ayahuasca的歐洲國家（van den Plas, 2011）。
然而在2016年，一位Santo Daime教會的成員從巴西入境荷蘭時，因攜帶33公斤的ayahuasca而遭逮補與起訴，雖然地方法院判決檢方敗訴，但檢方向阿姆斯特丹上訴法庭上訴後，上訴法庭於2018年判決，認為Santo Daime教會在ayahuasca成份的品管、ayahuasca使用者的健康評估、ayahuasca使用者不僅限於教會會員、未有醫療人員參與宗教儀式、使用ayahuasca之前與過程的監督程序、ayahuasca的運輸、儲存上不夠臻善，且考量荷蘭近年來ayahuasca的非宗教性使用之增加，因此認定ayahuasca在荷蘭的使用情況已造成公共健康的危害下，Santo Daime宗教性使用ayahuasca的行為將不再受到歐洲人權公約對宗教自由的保障，屬違法行為。目前此案件Santo Daime已上訴到荷蘭最高法院，訴訟仍在進行中。


法國


1999年Santo Daime的法國支部成員因持有和使用ayahuasca遭到起訴，在歷經多年的訴訟後Santo Daime獲得勝訴，但勝訴的理由並非基於宗教自由的權利而豁免，而是由於法院認為ayahuasca並不屬於管制物質，並且Santo Daime成員並未從ayahuasca中萃取出純的DMT，因此未觸法，Santo Daime得以合法使用ayahuasca。然而在三個多月後，法國政府將數種常用於製作ayahuasca的植物列入管制物質名單中，成為目前唯一將製作ayahuasca的植物列入管制物質法規的國家，讓ayahuasca在法國成為違禁物質（van den Plas, 2011）。


加拿大


Santo Daime在1996年於加拿大成立支部，2000年加拿大海關截獲一批ayahuasca後查驗出其中含有DMT和harmaline，因此通知該教會若後 續嘗試運輸和使用ayahuasca將觸犯法律，但並未就當次之查獲而起訴教會，且建議教會可以向加拿大衛生部門申請ayahuasca宗教性使用的豁免權，因此Santo Daime在加拿大並非透過司法程序，而是如同巴西的ayahuasca宗教團體透過與政府行政權力的協商，從2001年開始訴請ayahuasca的合法使用（Tupper, 2011），不過一直到2017年才正式取得了宗教性使用的豁免權，並與加拿大政府制定了管理ayahuasca運輸、儲存、使用之辦法。此外，加拿大政府對ayahuasca的管制地位之認定，亦依據ayahuasca中含有DMT和harmaline（兩種物質在加拿大的管制藥物與物質法案(Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, CDSA)中均列為第三級管制物質），因此認為ayahuasca屬於管制物質的範疇中。
Ayahuasca全球化的主要推手是UDV和Santo Daime的CELFLUIS支派，皆是發展歷史較長、較為建制化且較積極擴張的宗教團體，但他們無法僅以保障宗教自由之名而取得使用ayahuasca的豁免權利，從上述幾個歐美國家的案例中，我們可以看到ayahuasca宗教團體在全球化的過程中所面對的挑戰。在ayahuasca是否被認定為管制物質的問題上，雖然國際麻醉藥品管制委員會在回覆荷蘭公共衛生部的文件中已確認任何含有DMT的植物並不屬於聯合國精神藥物公約的管制範疇，並且由含有DMT之植物製作而成的製劑也同樣不在管制範疇，但國際麻醉藥品管制委員會並無實權可以強制締約國遵循其認定，締約國可以在國內實施更為嚴格的管制作法，因此上述國家的司法與行政機關，依據ayahuasca含有DMT，或是認為ayahuasca作為已透過人工處理成為含有DMT的製劑，因此也須納入管制範圍。相較之下，巴西政府則一貫認同國際麻醉藥品管制委員會的觀點。
這種將ayahuasca視為需管制的物質或藥物（drug）的生物醫學認識觀點，與宗教團體將ayahuasca視為能夠啟靈的聖品（sacrament），存在明顯的本體論差異。宗教團體為了獲得使用ayahuasca的合法性，首先需申請為合法的宗教團體才得以主張保障宗教自由的權利，也需與人類學家與醫學專家的合作進行民族誌與生物醫學的研究，經由專家證詞認可宗教團體因為發展出一套具規範性的實作原則，包括ayahuasca的製作技術、對ayahuasca使用者的狀態評估、儀式操作，以及針對已長期使用ayahuasca的教徒進行科學性的身心狀態評估，因而能夠確保教徒在宗教儀式的脈絡中使用ayahuasca不會造成身心健康的危害。
據此與各國政府進行協商或司法訴訟來獲得管制物質法規的豁免權，並且也必須與政府機關合作建立ayahuasca運輸、儲存、使用的管理監督機制，並且接受政府機關評估，是否有造成公共健康與安全的危害，包括教徒在儀式中使用的身心影響，以及ayahuasca是否有外流到教會以外，出現非宗教性之使用情形，一旦政府機關認為宗教團體使用ayahuasca的行為已造成公共性的危害，便得中止宗教團體使用ayahuasca的權利。
舉例而言，UDV在美國最高法院的訴訟中勝訴後，與美國緝毒局在2010年達成ayahuasca的管制協議，緝毒局要求UDV必須在進口ayahuasca之前先行通知與告知劑量，而進口、儲存、分配ayahuasca須遵守作業程序進行，每次儀式中使用ayahuasca的人數、總量必須記錄，儲存ayahuasca的地點與負責人需經緝毒局審核，若要將ayahuasca進行精煉濃縮、混合，需量化紀錄，若要丟棄ayahuasca，須事前告知緝毒局時間、地點和負責人，且緝毒局可全程監督。上述的管制作法，對緝毒局而言是在於避免ayahuasca外流的可能性，而緝毒局對ayahuasca的認定上仍認知為是一種含有一級管制物質DMT的物質（Labate, 2012）。
如此的管制措施對宗教團體而言，存在對既有教義內涵和宗教實作的影響，例如宗教團體是基於視ayahuasca為聖品之理由，而會嚴加保存不外流，但如今外流卻被視為是流出管制藥物；ayahuasca的製成過程是一個神聖的時刻且僅限特定教徒參與，但現在必須要接受外人的監督；教徒原有權利在特定情況下獲允許私存ayahuasca作個人使用，但管制規定將限定ayahuasca集中儲存。當宗教團體在巴西獲得相對自主的運作權利之時，在擴散至其他國家時必須因應不同的管制措施而需調整原有的宗教實作，而這個跨國∕跨文化的交會經驗，也可能回返到宗教團體自身，對原有的教義和理念進行詮釋的重構（Labate, 2012）。
如果現代性的一個特性在於將世俗事務與宗教信仰進行劃分，在宗教活動並未影響公共安全、公共秩序、衛生、道德和他人之權利與自由的前提下，宗教自由將獲得律法的保障，使得宗教活動不受國家治理權力的干涉。既然ayahuasca作為ayahuasca宗教團體中不可或缺的核心元素，那麼保障宗教自由的優先性―又特別在ayahuasca宗教這類少數宗教之權利保障——將凌駕於對物質管制的一般性規範要求，而讓宗教團體享有物質管制法規的豁免權。從上述ayahuasca宗教團體全球化歷程的案例中，基於不同的認識實作下形塑出不同的ayahuasca本體論，使得各國必須在宗教自由與物質管制、公共健康安全之間進行權衡，而ayahuasca宗教團體在不同國家內透過司法訴訟的角力、與行政權力的協商過程也呈現了不同的進程。
兩種全球化的交會：反思當代物質管制政策的現代性
從上述描繪現代國家透過聯合國的國際組織，制定一套國際合作的物質管制政策，以及ayahuasca宗教團體從巴西興起、繼而向國際擴展的案例，我們可以看到兩股全球化的動能向全球各個「在地」流動、傳播，而動能推及到每一個在地都會展現出不同的樣貌，例如ayahuasca宗教團體在巴西出現較保守的宗教團體會爭奪正統性、對積極擴張的宗教團體進行批評的現象，在加拿大同屬積極擴張的宗教團體則合作爭取ayahuasca使用的權利；全球物質管制政策雖以國際公約定義物質的管制地位，但巴西與法國卻對製作ayahuasca的植物有完全不同的認定。
這兩股動能傳遞到各個在地時會彼此交會、碰撞，而讓各個在地在處理ayahuasca宗教性使用議題的現象上也各有特色。巴西作為ayahuasca宗教團體的發源地，加上巴西政府在因應上採取較為寬容的作法，使得雖然巴西仍限定ayahuasca僅能在宗教儀式中使用，但宗教團體在生產、製作、分配、使用ayahuasca相對擁有較高的自主性；相較之下，作為「外來」、「小眾」、「使用管制物質」的宗教團體，在歐美國家中雖然能依據宗教自由的保障而獲得使用ayahuasca的權利，但歐美國家對於ayahuasca的認定上仍視為管制物質，在管制措施上仍傾向嚴謹控管，且可能會以公共健康與安全的理由加以限制宗教團體的使用權利。
這兩股動能雖然都是以全球化尺度進行傳播，但是兩者在力量的展現上仍有顯著差距。全球的物質管制政策以生物醫學知識作為論證的後盾，凸顯管制物質之使用行為所造成的個人身心健康與公共衛生負面影響，加上社會普遍的道德性譴責批判立場、國家權力以律法刑罰進行治理控管，以及透過國際組織與公約建立合作關係、約束締約國的管制作為，形成了全球全面性的監控網絡。而在這種物質管制的現代性中，世界上絕大多數的物質使用行為都透過單一的視角加以評判，僅有少數被認可為「傳統」、「宗教」儀式上的物質使用行為能夠取得豁免於刑罰的權利，並且認可的機制需透過國家權力扮演仲裁者，認可的原則、標準也並非物質使用者自我認定即有效。
從Ayahuasca宗教團體的全球化案例來看，雖然宗教團體將ayahuasca視為聖品的本體論觀點在現代性中得以宗教自由的主張而獲得尊重，但涉及到ayahuasca的使用行為，宗教團體就必須要與現代性中的其他認識論進行對話、協商，且經常需與國家權力進行角力、論辯，才得以獲得使用ayahuasca的權利，並且在配合管制規定之下，既有的宗教活動形式、內涵也會隨之進行調整、重構。
當代物質管制政策之中的現代性框架，進行了現代／傳統、世俗／宗教的劃分，為傳統、宗教性的物質使用行為提供了有條件、有限度的保留權利，至於現代、世俗的範疇，皆屬管制權力之領域。雖然Ayahuasca宗教團體必須在現代性中奮力搏鬥，但其發展歷程和全球化的現象，提供了質疑和挑戰隱藏在當代物質管制政策中既定認識論的線索，讓我們得以重新檢視、問題化此一現代性的認識框架與國家∕國際治理權力的作法。


現代／傳統


現代／傳統的劃分概念，蘊含著對於人類歷史中所創造的多樣文化應給予價值上的認可和重視，並應加以保留甚至延續的精神；而當代全球進入後殖民的階段，此概念也提醒著人類應反省過去數百年來，殖民的暴力對眾多文化所造成的斲傷甚至於毀滅的結果。但當這樣的劃分概念挪用至物質管制政策中看待「傳統」的物質使用行為時，似乎就不是那麼直覺性地予以認可，因為物質使用是否會造成使用者的身心影響——特別又以生物醫學的認識觀點作為基準——是物質管制政策的基本考量，因此需透過生物醫學研究來確認物質使用的安全性，不過傳統物質使用行為的「歷史」時間——如果物質會持續長時間被文化性地使用——也被採納可作為一種「自然式的」（naturalistic）確認安全性之證據。
至於對傳統的定義，就聯合國的精神藥物公約中對傳統的想像是限定在族群、植物與地理的空間疊合上，並且將傳統文化視為是靜止不變動的，如此少數、侷限的傳統物質使用行為，彷彿與現代社會是分離、不相容的，因此不會對多數人類所組成的「現代」社會造成影響。在此前提下，符合「傳統―歷史」性的物質使用行為可取得豁免於物質管制政策的權利。
然而我們可發現ayahuasca從亞馬遜叢林的原住民部落，傳遞到叢林外圍的mestizo族群之中（且經歷了族群的混種），一部分的傳播則透過融合了其他宗教而形成了ayahuasca宗教（其興教歷史尚不及百年），再擴展到巴西都市區，更越洋散佈到世界各地以及「現代西方」，這樣的移動過程中包括了叢林中的植物、原住民薩滿與其具備的知識及技術、儀式使用的物件以及「現代西方」人，在時間的遞嬗、空間的轉換之中，文化、知識、技術也一再經過混種、重組而變化。那麼，究竟ayahuasca宗教團體屬於現代的產物，還是原住民薩滿文化的傳統延續？不及百年的發展，能夠符合「歷史」的條件嗎？如果位在亞馬遜叢林邊界的ayahuasca宗教團體屬於傳統，那進入到巴西都市區、擴散到世界各地的支部，是不是就不傳統了？
而除卻ayahuasca宗教性使用的全球化現象，ayahuasca的全球化現象還有「非宗教」、「世俗」性使用的層次（雖然在絕大多數國家被視為「非法」之物質使用行為），也提供了更多樣的案例來豐富化對現代性的反省叩問。前述ayahuasca宗教團體從亞馬遜叢林的邊界向巴西都市地區擴張之外，原住民薩滿和習得薩滿儀式的mestizo也受到引介至都市，提供都市居民透過薩滿儀式中運用ayahuasca以體驗神秘經驗與精神療癒的機會，而興起了都市薩滿主義（urban shamanism）的風潮（Mercante, 2015）；而自1960年代，歐美國家中質疑西方現代化物質主義、亟欲探索靈性層次的人們，也透過旅行與交流―前往亞馬遜叢林，或是邀請薩滿至歐美國家進行薩滿儀式―而接觸到原住民薩滿文化與ayahuasca，並融合了西方各式的心理治療技術而發展出新薩滿主義（neo-shamanism）的療癒技術（Scuro, & Rodd, 2015）。
此外，自1950年代以生物醫學取向的科學研究，開始嘗試試驗各種精神驅動物質治療精神疾病的潛能，雖然在1970年後受到全球物質管制政策的影響而全面中止人體試驗，但1990年代UDV的醫學研究部門（UDV的巴西教徒中有5%至10%為醫學專家）邀請來自巴西、美國、芬蘭的科學家前往UDV的會堂，針對UDV教徒使用ayahuasca下的身心狀況，以及長期使用ayahuasca下的精神狀況進行觀察與評估，研究發現UDV教徒的精神狀況良好，並且許多教徒原有藥物、酒精和香菸成癮的問題，但在加入UDV之後成癮問題皆已戒除，因此運用ayahuasca治療成癮疾患的潛能受到重視，因為成癮疾患也是西方精神醫學目前仍難以提供有效治療的領域（McKenna et al., 1998）。
透過跨越地理疆域、族群、文化、國界的互動，讓ayahuasca以及ayahuasca原使用脈絡中的元素―知識、技術、儀式、物質、文化——傳播到不同的在地之中，但又在各個在地中經過揀選，與在地既有的社會技術網絡進行混合、重組後，形塑出異質、變種的ayahuasca網絡。如此多向的交流、穿透，讓現代／傳統的劃分概念無法有效解釋ayahuasca的傳播現象（而朝向另一個方向―過去、歷史―的省思，我們當下所能考察到最久遠的「傳統」，也可能是歷經持續交流和混種的階段性產物，而不是恆久不變的歷史結晶），而依據現代／傳統劃分概念而制定出的物質管制政策，也應重新接受檢討。


世俗／宗教


而另一個當代物質管制政策之制定框架所採取的現代性概念，是將世俗／宗教進行劃分。在現代性尊重宗教自由作為基本人權的前提下，一個人可以同時兼有世俗生活和宗教生活兩個部分，在宗教生活中以特定的本體論／認識論，透過宗教信念和宗教實作去達致靈性體驗、追尋超越性的精神意義。
但是若在現代性的框架內進行思考，我們需要去質問的是，要如何去判斷一個人選擇的探索途徑，是宗教性的或非宗教性的？判斷的依據標準為何？又是由誰握有權力來進行判斷？對欲爭取ayahuasca使用權利的人而言，若無法被認可為宗教團體，那就不存在合法使用ayahuasca的協商資格，因為「非宗教」、「世俗」性的ayahuasca使用行為，便屬違法行為；而ayahuasca宗教團體在發展歷程中會由於對教義詮釋、活動實作的歧異而出現團體分化的現象，甚至互相競爭、對立（MacRae, 2010），也會有發展歷史較短、新的宗教團體成立，以及出現非組織化型態的宗教實踐（例如並未正式申請為宗教團體、無固定舉辦宗教儀式的機構）（van den Plas, 2011）。這些「正統」以外的宗教團體、宗教實踐，能不能被認可為「宗教的」？
宗教學者Hanegraff指出，西方觀點的宗教論述常會以基督教神學作為基準，認為一個宗教會以教會形式之機構進行發展，且應建立教義作為基礎；並且，一個宗教所讚頌的神聖恩典（divine grace）應是由上位的神祇賜予下位的信眾，而非經由信眾的主動操縱而達致，否則會被視為是魔術而非宗教。而歐美宗教史的研究領域，傾向以哲學、理性、知識的認識論點來對宗教進行考察，但關於改變的意識狀態（altered states of consciousness, ASC）在宗教中的意義和角色的相關知識生產則未有充足累積，並且歐美宗教的歷史脈絡也欠缺可供考察的素材，因此若以歐美脈絡發展出的宗教學去認識其他運用精神驅動物質的宗教，便可能會對於宗教的認定有其偏見性（Hanegraaff, 2011）。
不過我們可以更基進地向現代性進行質問：欲達到探索靈性體驗、追尋超越性精神意義的目標，難道只能透過被認定為是宗教活動的途徑嗎？上述所提及「非宗教」、「世俗」性的ayahuasca使用現象在全世界經歷持續地混種，而不斷地發展出各式各樣的ayahuasca使用活動，雖然不被認可為宗教活動（或使用者自身也不自認為是屬於宗教活動），但若使用者自述從中獲得了靈性體驗、領悟到超越性的精神意義，只因該行為是「世俗」的（並且因為使用精神驅動物質，因此是「違法」的），我們就可以加以否定其意識、認知經驗的價值嗎？
結論：進入ayahuasca之使用實作，進行多重本體論∕認識論的對話、協商
如果物質管制政策關注物質使用的安全性、濫用性與社會危害性等問題，那麼最為務實的作法，或許就是暫時擱置現代／傳統、世俗／宗教之劃分概念，先不去認定某一特定的ayahuasca使用活動是否屬於傳統或宗教儀式之範疇，而直接針對該ayahuasca使用活動的使用脈絡與具體實作進行考察，去探問：「Ayahuasca是在什麼樣的脈絡之中使用？具體的實作細節―包括人、物、機構、情境、程序、規則的綜合配置―為何？ayahuasca的使用活動如何能達到使用者聲稱的安全性？Ayahuasca的使用是否確實能達到安全性的標準？」
從這樣的提問出發後，勢必會面對各方立場者以不同的本體論／認識論來對使用ayahuasca之實作進行分析、詮釋，而對比不同立場的觀點下，亦可能存在不可共量性（例如，使用ayahuasca時常出現的嘔吐反應，在生物醫學觀點可能會被視為是不良副作用，但對ayahuasca使用者而言，則可能會認為是一個清除體內毒素的必要過程）。對話與協商，是不同本體論／認識論交會中必經的過程，而位移（displacement）與混種，將是交會下的（階段性）結果。
然而我們需要謹記，只要不同的本體論／認識論之間存在著權力關係的不對等，便會讓強勢的本體論／認識論掌握對事物、現象的詮釋權。因此拆解當代物質管制政策的現代性概念、強調進入ayahuasca的使用實作中進行多重本體論／認識論之分析，並讓ayahuasca使用者獲得對等的發言與協商權利，讓其經驗與宇宙觀得以呈現，將會是一條以開放、平等、尊重多元的倫理原則，認識何謂ayahuasca、探究如何安全使用與合理管制ayahuasca、如何讓ayahuasca發揮身心靈療癒力量的可能途徑。

The vine water and contemporary material control policy (below): Under the globalization of religion, how do European and American countries regulate?
04 Nov 2019, 08:00 by STS multiple play


What we want you to know is that the more conservative religious groups of ayahuasca religious groups in Brazil will compete for legitimacy and criticize actively expanding religious groups. In Canada, the same active religious groups cooperate to fight for the rights of ayahuasca. Although the global material control policy defines the regulatory status of substances by international conventions, Brazil and France have completely different definitions of the plants that make ayahuasca.

Dead Rattan Water and Contemporary Material Control Policy (I): How does the Brazilian government legalize religious use?


In the second place: Ayahuasca, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Canada under the globalization of religion
The Brazilian ayahuasca religious group obtained the legality of using ayahuasca in the country in 1987. Since the 1980s, the contact between the middle class and the religious groups in the city has made some religious groups - the CEFLURIS tribe of UDV and Santo Daime the most active. ―From the border of the Amazon jungle to the expansion of the Brazilian metropolitan area (antana de Rose, 2018c); in addition, people from all over the world who are new to the spiritual age movement have become ayahuasca religion after contacting ayahuasca in Brazil. Believers, after returning to their own country, set up branches to continue religious activities and conduct publicity. However, these international religious branches have faced different national governance principles in different countries and become new challenges for the expansion of ayahuasca religion. .

United States


UDV began to develop in the United States in 1987 and was officially registered as a religious group in 1994. However, in 1999, US Customs seized ayahuasca, which was transported from Brazil, claiming that it was seized because it contained DMT as a contraband. At first, UDV hoped to hold a seminar, and experts from various fields explained to the government officials the religious use of ayahuasca religion and ayahuasca in order to obtain government permission. However, it was unsuccessful in the ongoing dialogue, so UDV lodged a complaint with the US Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Department through the judicial process, and advocated the right to exercise religious freedom in order to use ayahuasca in religious ceremonies.
The US Department of Justice has proposed three grounds for safeguarding national interests against UDV's use of ayahuasca's religious practices:

The DMT contained in ayahuasca will be harmful to public health and safety.
Authorizing UDV to use ayahuasca religiously, there is a risk that ayahuasca will flow towards recreational and commercial use.
The International Regulations on Material Control list DMT as a controlled substance and should therefore not violate international regulations.

In 2002, the District Court of New Mexico was unable to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that UDV members used ayahuasca in ritual situations to generate serious health risks. The use of ayahuasca by UDV members significantly led to the non-religious use of ayahuasca, and ayahuasca was not included in 1971. The United Nations Psychotropic Substances Convention control project, therefore agreed to UDV's preliminary injunction against the US government to restrict UDV use of ayahuasca (Bronfman, 2011).
After losing the lawsuit, the US government continued to appeal to limit the rights of UDV to use ayahuasca but still failed. In 2005, it appealed to the Supreme Court. Although the Supreme Court overturned the previous judgment that ayahuasca was not included in the UN Psychotropic Substances Convention, The Psychotropic Substance Convention and the United States Controlled Substances Act classify DMT as a primary control substance and should therefore extend the inclusion of ayahuasca in the scope of control, but based on the exercise of the right to guarantee religious freedom, and in accordance with the Religious Freedom Act of 1993 (Religious Freedom The Restoration Act, RFRA), when an individual's religious activities are intervened by the government, can be used to protect the freedom of religious activities, and the US government cannot provide strong evidence that the religious use of ayahuasca can cause health hazards and approval Ayahuasca gives UDV an inflow into the illicit market, so UDV's use of ayahuasca in religious ceremonies is exempt from the control of the Controlled Substances Act (Bronfman, 2011) under the balance of religious freedom and material control.
It is worth mentioning that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enacted in 1994 to provide exemption for the use of the American Indian aborigines in religious ceremonies using the peiote (Fig. 1) containing the mescaline listed as the primary control substance. The legal basis for the scope of the Substance Act is therefore a precedent for judgments cited by the Supreme Court in the UDV lawsuit. After the victory of UDV, the Santo Daime Church in Origang also filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Origang in 2008 to obtain the legality of using ayahuasca, and also won the case in 2009.

Netherlands


Although the Netherlands is a country with a looser material control policy, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that it was legal, containing psilocybin and psilocin (Figure 2), if it was manually treated – including simple desiccation – It will be a controlled substance, which means that it is illegal to do it manually; this principle also applies to other plants containing mentally driven substances, so if you take the most commonly used natural plants of Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis in ayahuasca It is not illegal, but it is illegal to treat these two plants into ayahuasca and to hold and use ayahuasca. In 2008, the Netherlands decided to increase the control of psilocybin and psilocin, and it was considered illegal to produce, sell, hold, and use untreated cockroaches containing psilocybin and psilocin (van den Plas, 2011).

Santo Daime was officially registered as a religious group in the Netherlands in 1995 [Fig. 24], but the two church leaders were arrested in 1999 by the Netherlands, accusing the law of using ayahuasca for religious ceremonies. The Santo Daime Church filed a lawsuit on the grounds of the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee the fundamental right to freedom of religion in order to gain the right to use ayahuasca. The prosecutor used ayahuasca as a manually processed product, which was treated as a regulated DMT. Therefore, violation of the law as a defense.
During the proceedings, the Dutch Ministry of Public Health asked the International Narcotics Control Board about the state of control of ayahuasca, and the International Narcotics Control Board responded that no plants containing DMT were listed in the control list of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so any Preparations made from DMT plants - including ayahuasca - are not within the scope of international material control (Schaepe, 2001), but the Amsterdam District Court rejected the interpretation of the International Narcotics Control Board in the judgment, arguing that ayahuasca should be a controlled substance. However, the Amsterdam District Court based on Santo Daime should be protected by the freedom of religion of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the expert opinion provided by Santo Daime recognizes that the use of ayahuasca in religious ceremonies can avoid health hazards and that the prosecution cannot provide sufficient evidence to prove Santo Daime Religious use of ayahuasca affects public security, public order, health, ethics and the rights and freedoms of others. In 2001, Santo Daime was awarded the presidency, making the Netherlands the first to allow religious use of ayahuasca religious groups. European country of huasca (van den Plas, 2011).
However, in 2016, a member of the Santo Daime church was arrested and prosecuted for carrying 33 kilograms of ayahuasca when he entered the Netherlands from Brazil. Although the district court ruled that the prosecution lost, the appeal court appealed to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. Judging in 2018, it is believed that Santo Dais church's quality control in ayahuasca, health assessment of ayahuasca users, and ayahuasca users are not limited to church members, no medical personnel participate in religious ceremonies, use of ayahuasca and process supervision procedures, ayahuasca Transportation and storage are not good enough, and considering the increase in the non-religious use of ayahuasca in the Netherlands in recent years, it is determined that the use of ayahuasca in the Netherlands has caused public health hazards, and Santo Daime’s religious use of ayahuasca will no longer be The protection of religious freedom by the European Convention on Human Rights is illegal. At present, Santo Daime has appealed to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands and the lawsuit is still in progress.


France


In 1999, members of the French branch of Santo Daime were prosecuted for holding and using ayahuasca. After several years of litigation, Santo Daime won the case, but the reason for the victory was not exempted based on the right to freedom of religion, but because the court held that ayahuasca did not It is a controlled substance, and Santo Daime members did not extract pure DMT from ayahuasca, so they did not touch the law and Santo Daime was able to legally use ayahuasca. However, after more than three months, the French government listed several plants commonly used in the production of ayahuasca on the list of controlled substances, making it the only country that has included ayahuasca plants in the control substance regulations, making ayahuasca a banned substance in France ( Van den Plas, 2011).


Canada


Santo Daime established a branch in Canada in 1996. In 2000, Canadian Customs intercepted a batch of ayahuasca and found that it contained DMT and harmaline. Therefore, the church was informed that if the subsequent attempt to transport and use ayahuasca would violate the law, it did not seize the case. And sued the church, and suggested that the church can apply to the Canadian health department for exemption from the religious use of ayahuasca. Therefore, Santo Daime is not through the judicial process in Canada, but is like the Brazilian ayahuasca religious group through consultation with the government's administrative power from 2001. Beginning to appeal to the legal use of ayahuasca (Tupper, 2011), but it was not until 2017 that the official use of immunity was granted, and the Canadian government has established a method for managing the transportation, storage and use of ayahuasca. In addition, the Canadian government's determination of the regulatory status of ayahuasca is based on the inclusion of DMT and harmaline in ayahuasca (the two substances are listed as tertiary control substances in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). ), therefore, think that ayahuasca belongs to the category of controlled substances.
The main drivers of Ayahuasca's globalization are the CELFLUIS tribes of UDV and Santo Daime, all of which are long-established, more institutionalized and more actively expanding religious groups, but they cannot obtain the exemption rights to use ayahuasca only in the name of guaranteeing religious freedom. From the cases of several European and American countries mentioned above, we can see the challenges faced by the ayahuasca religious group in the process of globalization. On the question of whether ayahuasca was identified as a controlled substance, although the International Narcotics Control Board has confirmed in the replies to the Dutch Ministry of Public Health that any plant containing DMT is not under the control of the United Nations Psychotropic Substances Convention and contains DMT Plant-made preparations are also outside the scope of regulation, but the International Narcotics Control Board has no real power to compel the State party to follow its findings, and the State party can enforce stricter regulations in the country, so the judicial and administrative authorities of the above-mentioned countries Ayawasca contains DMT, or it is considered that ayahuasca has been artificially processed into a formulation containing DMT and therefore must be included in the scope of control. In contrast, the Brazilian government has consistently agreed with the views of the International Narcotics Control Board.
There is a clear ontological difference between this view of biomedical knowledge that ayahuasca sees as a substance or drug to be regulated, and the religious group's view of ayahuasca as a sacrament. In order to obtain the legality of the use of ayahuasca, religious groups must first apply for a legal religious group to claim the right to guarantee religious freedom. They also need to cooperate with anthropologists and medical experts to conduct ethnographic and biomedical research, through expert testimony. Recognized religious groups have developed a set of normative practical principles, including ayahuasca's production techniques, state assessments of ayahuasca users, ritual operations, and scientific assessments of physical and mental status of those who have long used ayahuasca. It can ensure that the use of ayahuasca by believers in the context of religious rituals does not cause physical and mental health.
According to this, consultation with governments or judicial proceedings to obtain immunity from controlled substances regulations, and must also cooperate with government agencies to establish a management and supervision mechanism for transportation, storage and use of ayahuasca, and accept government agencies to assess whether there is public health and The hazards of safety, including the physical and mental effects of the use of the cults in the ritual, and whether ayahuasca has flowed out of the church, have non-religious use. Once the government agency believes that the use of ayahuasca by religious groups has caused public harm, it will be Suspend the right of religious groups to use ayahuasca.
For example, after UDV won the US Supreme Court lawsuit, it reached a ayahuasca control agreement with the US Drug Enforcement Administration in 2010. The Drug Enforcement Administration required UDV to notify and inform the dose before importing ayahuasca, while importing, storing, and distributing ayahuasca. It is necessary to follow the operating procedures. The number and total amount of ayahuasca used in each ceremony must be recorded. The location and person in charge of storing ayahuasca must be reviewed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. To refine, concentrate, and mix ayahuasca, it is necessary to quantify the records. Ayawasca, must inform the time, place and person in charge of the Drug Enforcement Bureau beforehand, and the Drug Enforcement Bureau can supervise the whole process. The above-mentioned pipe making method is for the Drug Enforcement Bureau to avoid the possibility of ayahuasca outflow, and the Drug Administration's recognition of ayahuasca is still known as a substance containing the primary control substance DMT (Labate, 2012).
Such control measures have an impact on religious connotations and religious practices for religious groups. For example, religious groups are based on the reason that ayahuasca is a sacred product, but they will be strictly preserved, but now the outflow is seen. In order to be a controlled drug outbreak; the manufacturing process of ayahuasca is a sacred moment and is restricted to specific believers, but it must now be supervised by outsiders; the original rights of the believer are allowed to be privately stored in ayahuasca for personal use under certain circumstances, but Regulations will limit the centralized storage of ayahuasca. When religious groups gain relative autonomy in Brazil, they must adjust their original religious practices in response to different regulatory measures when they spread to other countries. This cross-cultural cross-cultural experience may also return. The religious group itself reconstructs the interpretation of the original doctrine and ideas (Labate, 2012).
If one of the characteristics of modernity is the division of secular affairs and religious beliefs, religious freedom will be guaranteed by the law, provided that religious activities do not affect public safety, public order, health, morality, and the rights and freedoms of others. Make religious activities uninterrupted by the power of state governance. Since ayahuasca is an indispensable core element of the ayahuasca religious community, then the priority of guaranteeing religious freedom - and in particular the protection of the rights of minority religions such as the ayahuasca religion - will override the general normative requirements for material control, and Religious groups enjoy immunity from material control regulations. From the case of the above-mentioned globalization of ayahuasca religious groups, different ayahuasca ontology is shaped based on different understandings, so that countries must balance between religious freedom and material control, public health and safety, and ayahuasca religious groups. The process of negotiating judicial proceedings in different countries and the process of negotiating with administrative power also presents different processes.
Two Global Intersections: Rethinking the Modernity of Contemporary Material Control Policy
From the above-mentioned international organization that depicts modern countries through the United Nations, a set of material control policies for international cooperation, and the case of the rise of ayahuasca religious groups from Brazil and then to the international community, we can see the dynamics of the two global forces to the world. Flowing and spreading on the ground, and kinetic energy will be introduced to each place to show different appearances. For example, the more conservative religious groups of ayahuasca religious groups in Brazil will compete for orthodoxy and criticize the actively expanding religious groups. Phenomenon, the same active religious groups in Canada cooperate to fight for the rights of ayahuasca; although the global material control policy defines the regulatory status of substances by international conventions, Brazil and France have completely different definitions of plants for making ayahuasca.
These two kinetic energy will be transmitted to each other and will meet and collide with each other, and each of them will have its own characteristics in dealing with the issue of religious use of ayahuasca. Brazil is the birthplace of the ayahuasca religious group, and the Brazilian government has adopted a more tolerant approach in response. Although Brazil still restricts ayahuasca to use only in religious ceremonies, religious groups are relatively own in the production, production, distribution and use of ayahuasca. Higher autonomy; in contrast, religious groups that are ""foreign"", ""niche"", and ""use of controlled substances"" can obtain the right to use ayahuasca in accordance with the protection of religious freedom in European and American countries, but Europe and the United States. The state still regards ayahuasca as a controlled substance, and it still tends to be strictly controlled in terms of control measures, and may limit the use rights of religious groups on public health and safety grounds.
Although these two kinetic energy are spread on the scale of globalization, there is still a significant gap between the two in the display of strength. The global material control policy is backed by arguments based on biomedical knowledge, highlighting the negative effects of individual physical and mental health and public health caused by the use of controlled substances, plus the universal moral condemnation of critical positions, state power and legal punishment. Governance control, as well as the establishment of cooperative relations between international organizations and conventions, and the regulation of contracting parties, have formed a global comprehensive monitoring network. In the modernity of this substance control, the vast majority of material use behaviors in the world are judged through a single perspective. Only a few of the material use behaviors recognized as ""traditional"" and ""religious"" rituals can be exempted. The right to penalties, and the mechanism of recognition must act as an arbitrator through state power. The principles and standards of recognition are not valid for the self-identification of material users.
Judging from the globalization case of Ayahuasca religious groups, although religious groups regard ayahuasca as the sacred product, the ontological view is respected by the idea of religious freedom in modernity, but when it comes to the use of ayahuasca, religious groups must Dialogue and negotiation with other epistemologies in modernity, and often need to wrestle and argue with state power to obtain the right to use ayahuasca, and under the control regulations, the existing forms and connotations of religious activities will follow It is adjusted and reconstructed.
The modernity framework in contemporary material control policies has carried out modern/traditional, secular/religious divisions, providing conditional and limited reservation rights for traditional and religious material use behaviors. As for modern and secular categories, They are all areas of regulatory power. Although the Ayahuasca religious group must struggle in modernity, its development process and the phenomenon of globalization provide doubts and challenges to the clues of established epistemology hidden in contemporary material control policies, allowing us to re-examine and problem this modernity. Sexual understanding framework and the practice of state international governance power.


Modern/traditional


The concept of modern/traditional division implies the recognition and appreciation of the diverse cultures created in human history, and should be preserved or extended. The concept of contemporary globalization entering post-colonialism also reminds Humanity should reflect on the consequences of the brutality and even destruction of colonial violence over many centuries. However, when such a concept of diversion is applied to the material use behavior of the ""traditional"" in the material control policy, it seems that it is not so intuitively recognized, because whether the use of the substance will cause the physical and mental effects of the user - especially biomedicine The cognition perspective is the benchmark – it is the basic consideration of the substance control policy. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the safety of the use of the substance through biomedical research, but the “history” time of the use of the traditional substance – if the substance will continue to be cultural for a long time Land use – also adopted as evidence of a “naturalistic” confirmation of safety.
As for the definition of tradition, the traditional imagination in the United Nations Psychotropic Substance Convention is limited to the spatial overlap of ethnic groups, plants and geography, and regards traditional culture as static, non-variable, such a small number of traditional substances. The use of behavior seems to be separate and incompatible with modern society, so it will not affect the ""modern"" society composed of most human beings. Under this premise, the use of substances that conform to the ""traditional-historical"" nature can be exempted from the substance control policy.
However, we can find that ayahuasca is transmitted from the aboriginal tribes of the Amazon jungle to the mestizo group outside the jungle (and has experienced a mixture of ethnic groups), and part of the communication has formed the ayahuasca religion through the integration of other religions. The history is less than a hundred years old, and then extended to the Brazilian metropolitan area, and spread across the world and the ""modern west"". This movement includes the plants in the jungle, the aboriginal shaman and the knowledge and technology, and the rituals. The objects used and the ""modern western"" people, in the transformation of time, the transformation of space, culture, knowledge, technology have also been mixed and reorganized and changed. So, is the ayahuasca religious group a modern product or a traditional continuation of the aboriginal shaman culture? Can it meet the conditions of ""history"" in less than a hundred years of development? If the ayahuasca religious group on the border of the Amazon jungle is a tradition, then is it not traditional to enter the Brazilian metropolitan area and spread to branches around the world?
In addition to the globalization phenomenon of ayahuasca's religious use, ayahuasca's globalization phenomenon also has the level of ""non-religious"" and ""secular"" use (although it is regarded as ""illegal"" material use behavior in most countries). More examples are provided to enrich the introspection of modernity. In addition to the expansion of the aforementioned ayahuasca religious group from the border of the Amazon jungle to the Brazilian metropolitan area, the aboriginal shaman and the learned shaman ritual mesizo were also introduced to the city, providing urban residents to experience the mysterious experience and spirit through the use of ayahuasca in the shamanic ritual. The opportunity to heal, and the rise of urban shamanism (Mercante, 2015); and since the 1960s, people in Europe and the United States who questioned Western modern materialism and desire to explore the spiritual level, also through travel and Communicate - go to the Amazon jungle, or invite shamans to Europe and the United States for shaman ceremonies - and contact the aboriginal shaman culture and ayahuasca, and combine various Western psychotherapy techniques to develop new shamanism (neo- Shamanism) healing techniques (Scuro, & Rodd, 2015).
In addition, since the 1950s, biomedical-oriented scientific research has begun to try to test the potential of various psycho-driven substances for the treatment of mental illness. Although it was completely affected by the global material control policy after 1970 and completely stopped human trials, the medicine of UDV in the 1990s The research department (5% to 10% of UDV Brazilians are medical experts) invites scientists from Brazil, the United States, and Finland to go to the UDV hall, use the physical and mental conditions of ayahuasca for UDVs, and the long-term use of mental conditions under ayahuasca. Observing and evaluating, the study found that the mental state of UDV believers is good, and many believers have problems with drugs, alcohol and cigarette addiction, but after adding UDV, the problem of addiction has been quit, so the potential of using ayahuasca to treat addiction disorders It is valued because addiction disorders are also areas where Western psychiatry is still difficult to provide effective treatment (McKenna et al., 1998).
Through the interaction of geographical boundaries, ethnic groups, cultures, and national boundaries, the elements of ayahuasca and ayahuasca's original use of context—knowledge, technology, ritual, material, and culture—are spread to different places, but at various places. After being selected and mixed and reorganized with the existing social technology network, it has shaped a heterogeneous and variant ayahuasca network. Such multi-directional communication and penetration make the concept of modern/traditional division unable to effectively explain the phenomenon of ayahuasca's communication (and toward the other direction - past, history), we can now examine the oldest ""tradition"" It may also be a phased product of continuous communication and mixed farming, rather than a permanent historical crystallization. The material control policy formulated according to the modern/traditional concept should also be re-examined.


Secular/religious


The concept of modernity adopted by another framework for the development of contemporary material control policies is to divide secular/religious. Under the premise that modernity respects religious freedom as a basic human right, a person can have both secular and religious life, and achieve spirituality through religious ontology and religious practice through specific ontology/epistemology in religious life. Experience and pursue the spiritual meaning of transcendence.
But if we think in the framework of modernity, what we need to ask is how to judge the way a person chooses to explore, is it religious or non-religious? What is the basis for judging? Who is holding power to judge? For those who want to use ayahuasca's right to use, if they cannot be recognized as a religious group, there is no legal qualification to use ayahuasca for negotiation, because ""non-religious"" and ""secular"" ayahuasca use behavior is illegal; In the course of development, the ayahuasca religious group will have a group differentiation phenomenon due to the differences in teaching interpretation and activity, and even compete with each other (MacRae, 2010). There will also be a short history of development and the establishment of new religious groups. And religious practices in the form of unorganized forms (for example, institutions that have not formally applied for religious groups and have no fixed religious ceremonies) (van den Plas, 2011). Can religious groups and religious practices other than these ""orthodox"" be recognized as ""religious""?
Religious scholar Hanegraff pointed out that religious discourses in Western perspectives often use Christian theology as a benchmark. They believe that a religion will develop in a church-like institution and should be based on doctrine; and a divine grace that a religion praises should It is given to the lower believers by the superior gods, not by the active manipulation of the believers, otherwise it will be regarded as magic rather than religion. The research field of European and American religious history tends to examine religion with the philosophical, rational, and knowledgeal cognition points, but the knowledge about the meaning and role of the changed states of consciousness (ASC) in religion is There is not enough accumulation, and the historical context of European and American religions is also lacking for investigation.Material, so if you use the religion developed in Europe and the United States to understand other religions that use spiritually driven substances, you may be biased towards the identification of religion (Hanegraaff, 2011).
However, we can question the modernity more fundamentally: Is it possible to achieve the goal of exploring spiritual experience and pursuing transcendental spiritual meaning through the path of being recognized as a religious activity? The above-mentioned ""non-religious"" and ""secular"" ayahuasca use phenomenon continues to be mixed throughout the world, and continues to develop a variety of ayahuasca use activities, although not recognized as religious activities (or use) The person himself does not consider himself to be a religious activity, but if the user self-reports to obtain a spiritual experience and realize the spiritual meaning of transcendence, it is because the behavior is ""secular"" (and because of the use of spiritually driven substances, it is Can we deny the value of our consciousness and cognitive experience?
Conclusion: Entering the use of ayahuasca to conduct dialogue and negotiation on multiple ontology and epistemology
If the substance control policy focuses on the safety, abuse and social harm of the use of substances, then the most pragmatic approach may be to temporarily suspend the concept of modern/traditional, secular/religious divisions, and not to identify a particular ayahuasca. Whether the use of activities is in the scope of traditional or religious rituals, and directly examine the use of the ayahuasca use activities and specific implementations, to explore: ""What kind of context is Ayahuasca used? Specific implementation details - including Comprehensive configuration of people, things, institutions, situations, procedures, and rules—Why? How can ayahuasca's use activities achieve the claimed safety of users? Does Ayahuasca's use really meet safety standards?""
Starting from such a question, it is bound to face the positions of all parties with different ontology/epistemology to analyze and interpret the use of ayahuasca's implementation. However, under the viewpoint of comparing different positions, there may be irreconcilability ( For example, the vomiting reaction that often occurs with ayahuasca may be considered a side effect in biomedical perspectives, but for ayahuasca users, it may be considered a necessary process to remove toxins from the body). Dialogue and negotiation are the necessary processes in different ontology/epistemological rendezvous, and displacement and hybridization will be the (phased) results of the rendezvous.
However, we need to keep in mind that as long as there is a unequal power relationship between different ontology/epistemology, the powerful ontology/epistemology will have the right to interpret things and phenomena. Therefore, the concept of modernity of contemporary material control policies is dismantled, and the analysis of multiple ontology/epistemology is emphasized in the use of ayahuasca, and the ayahuasca users are given equal rights to speak and negotiate, so that their experience and cosmology can be presented. It will be an ethical principle of openness, equality, respect for diversity, understanding what ayahuasca is, exploring how to safely use and rationally control ayahuasca, and how to let ayahuasca play the healing power of the body and mind.
