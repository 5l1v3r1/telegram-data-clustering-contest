      <h1>Trump ‘invents insane conspiracy theory’ in wild impeachment outburst</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:41:15+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zamira Rahim</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has accused <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, the congressman leading the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives’</a> impeachment inquiry, of corruption.</p>
      <p>The president is under increasing pressure from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/congress">Congress</a> over his alleged behaviour during a call with the leader of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>In a series of increasingly angry tweets Mr Trump said congressional testimony from inquiry witnesses should not be released publicly.</p>
      <p>“If Shifty Adam Schiff, who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the ‘call’, is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers [and] others that are [and] were interviewed, he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes,” he wrote on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>In an extraordinary claim, the 73-year-old alleged that Mr Schiff, who chairs the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/house-intelligence-committee">House Intelligence Committee</a>, could manipulate witness transcripts.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republicans">Republicans</a> must have nothing to do with Shifty’s rendition of those interviews,” Mr Trump added</p>
      <p>“He is a proven liar, leaker &amp; freak who is really the one who should be impeached!”</p>
      <p>House Democrats voted last week to authorise Mr Schiff to lead the public inquiry. This will include hearings in which witnesses are questioned.</p>
      <p>The congressman’s remit is a broad one but will focus on the president’s alleged behaviour during the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> call.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump is accused of using <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us">US</a> military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a> and his family.</p>
      <p>The president has repeatedly denied offering a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>Alexander Windman, one of the witnesses and previously the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/national-security-council">National Security Council</a> director for Ukraine, told Congress last week that he approached <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/white-house">White House</a> lawyers after the call because its contents had left him so concerned.</p>
      <p>John Eisenberg, deputy counsel to the president for national security affairs, later told Mr Windman not to tell anyone about the phone call.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump has regularly attacked Adam Schiff in the past. The president called the congressman “Shifty Adam Schiff” for the first time on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> in April 2019.</p>
      <p>He has also previously implied, without evidence, that Mr Schiff is corrupt, guilty of fraud and leaks to the media.</p>
      <p>These criticisms, which appear to lack a factual basis, have also emerged from Trump allies such as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sean-hannity">Sean Hannity</a>, who presents a show on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fox-news">Fox News</a>.</p>
      <p>Jesse Waters, another Fox presenter, also accused Mr Schiff of being “totally corrupt” last month.</p>
      <p>Brian Klaas, an assistant professor in global politics at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ucl">UCL</a>, criticised the president’s social media conduct.</p>
      <p>“Trump calls the chairman of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/house-intelligence-committee">House Intelligence Committee</a> “a freak” and invents yet another insane conspiracy theory and it will barely be a story,” he said, on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Democracy erodes when previously unthinkable conduct becomes so routine that it’s barely even noticed by voters.”</p>
      <p>The Ukraine scandal began when a whistleblower, thought to be a member of the intelligence community, reported the president’s behaviour.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the president urged journalists to publicly identify the whistelblower.</p>
      <p>“You would be doing the public a service if you did,” the president claimed.</p>
      <p>He also refused to rule out shutting down the government if <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democrats</a> did not stop the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see what happens,” the 73-year-old said. “I wouldn’t commit to anything.”</p>
