南投縣竹山鎮昨（3日）發生一起酒駕死亡車禍，一名蘇姓駕駛疑似在竹山鎮鯉魚南路靠近過溪派出所路段，在轉彎時車速過快失控，偏離車道，衝往對向車道的竹林裡去，車頭還筆直的撞上電線桿，消防人員獲報趕往現場，蘇男已經沒有生命跡象，而他體內酒精濃度高達1毫克以上，簡直拿自己生命開玩笑！
昨（3日）晚7點40分左右，南投縣消防局119勤務中心獲報，指竹山鎮鯉南路靠近過溪派出所路段，發生車禍；消防人員趕抵現場，只見一部自小客車撞得全毀，駕駛蘇姓男子滿頭滿臉鮮血，困在駕駛座裡，救難隊人員動用各式破壞機具，才將他救出來，當時他已經沒有生命跡象，經送往秀傳醫院，還是回天乏術。

現場車輪軌跡以及種種跡症顯示，蘇姓駕駛可能在轉彎路段車速過快，一時失控越過對向車道，衝往邊坡的竹林，猛力撞上電線桿，以致於車頭全毀，駕駛座變形；經抽血酒測，蘇男體內酒精濃度超過1毫克，一般人早已是不省人事的泥醉狀態，如此還敢開車上路，真是拿命不當一回事！
警方指出，以臨檢酒測實務經驗而言，一般人酒精代謝率每1小時約為每公升0.06至0.08毫克，喝完酒30分鐘至1小時之間酒測值最高，酒測值1毫克以上，整個人幾乎已呈現昏昏沉沉的昏睡狀態，因此，警方研判，酒駕才是肇事主因，也再度呼籲民眾能遵守「喝酒不開車、開車不喝酒」原則，類似悲劇才可望避免發生。

A drunk driving accident occurred in Zhushan Town, Nantou County. Firefighters tried to rescue the driving situation in the trapped car. (Rewind screen)

The on-site wheel trajectory and various traces show that Su’s driving may be too fast in the turning section. When he accidentally crossed the opposite lane, he rushed to the slope of the bamboo forest and slammed into the pole, causing the front of the car to be completely destroyed. After blood sampling, the concentration of alcohol in Su male is more than 1 milligram. The average person has long been an unconscious state of intoxication. So dare to drive on the road, it is really a bad thing!
The police pointed out that in terms of clinical experience in alcohol testing, the average alcohol metabolism rate is about 0.06 to 0.08 mg per liter per hour, and the highest alcohol measurement value is between 30 minutes and 1 hour after drinking. The alcohol measurement value is 1 mg or more. The whole person has almost shown a stunned state of lethargy. Therefore, the police have judged that drunk driving is the main cause of the accident. It also once again appeals to the people to abide by the principle of ""drinking without driving, driving without drinking"", and similar tragedies can be avoided.

★ ""Mirror Weekly"" cares about you: drinking alcohol is prohibited under the age of 18, drinking too much harms others, driving after drinking, safe and secure.
