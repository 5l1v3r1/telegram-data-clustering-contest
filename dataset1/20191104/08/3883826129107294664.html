        <b>A jury has been sworn in for the trial of a man accused of murdering a British backpacker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grace Millane, 22, was last seen in central Auckland, New Zealand, on 1 December last year, before her body was found in bushland a week later.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old local man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has denied her murder.</p>
      <p>The Auckland High Court trial is scheduled to last up to five weeks.</p>
      <p>Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family.</p>
      <p>She had been travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following a six-week group trip through South America.</p>
      <p>The family of Miss Millane, from Wickford, Essex, became concerned for the University of Lincoln graduate after she failed to respond to birthday messages on 2 December.</p>
