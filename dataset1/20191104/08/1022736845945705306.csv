Emmanuel Macron azuru China, mikataba kadhaa kutiwa saini
04 Nov 2019, 08:29 by RFI

Emmanuel Macron anaendelea na ziara ya serikali nchini China. Atafanya ziara ya siku tatu Shanghai na Beijing. Lengo la ziara hiyo ya rais wa Ufaransa ni kuimarisha uhusiano kati ya nchi hizo mbili.

Mikataba kadhaa inatarajiwa kutiwa saini wakati wa ziara hiyo, haswa katika sekta ya kilimo na nishati.
Ikiwa suala la mgogoro mkubwa wa kimataifa na suala la tabia nchi litakuwa kwenye ajenda ya mazungumzo ya wawili hao, swala la kibiashara, litapewa kipaumbele katika ziara hii kama mwaka jana, wakati ambapo rais wa Ufaransa pia anatazamiwa kuzindua ofisi mpya ya Kituo George Pompidou jijini Shanghai.
Ufaransa inatarajia kuishawishi China kuimarisha uhusiano wake na Ufaransa katika nyanja mbalimbali. Rais Macron atataka ""kueza tena sawa uhusiano wa nchi mbili""; kwani hata kama mikataba zaidi ya arobaini inatarajiwa kutiwa saini wakati wa ziara hii, nakisi ya biashara ya Ufaransa na China inasalia kuwa mbaya, hadi kiwango cha euro bilioni 29.
Kwa hivyo suala hili pia litakuwa kwenye ajenda ya mazungumzo kati ya Emmanuel Macron na mwenyeji wake Xi Jinping, kuanzia Jumatatu hii jioni wakati wa chakula cha kwanza cha jioni, na Jumanne usiku wakati wa chakula cha jioni kabla ya uzinduzi wa maonyesho ya bidhaa kutoka Shanghai, ambapo Ufaransa ambayo inatafuta kushiriki kwenye soko la China, ni mgeni wa heshima.
Rais wa Ufaranda Emmanuel Macron anaambatana na viongozi hamsini wa makampuni mbalimbali, kama Airbus, Oreal, Sanof, lakini pia SME, Devialet na Deezer.

Emmanuel Macron visits China, several signing agreements
04 Nov 2019, 08:29 by RFI

Emmanuel Macron continues with a government visit to China. He will do a three-day tour in Shanghai and Beijing. The purpose of the French presidential visit is to strengthen relations between the two countries.

Several agreements are expected to be signed during the visit, especially in the agricultural and energy sector.
If the issue of the global crisis and the issue of behavior will be on the agenda for the two, the commercial question will be given priority on this visit as last year, when the French president is also expected to launch the new George Pompidou Center office in Shanghai .
France intends to persuade China to strengthen its relations with France in various fields. President Macron will want to ""re-establish bilateral relations""; since even if more than forty agreements are expected to be signed during this visit, the French and Chinese trade deficit remains poor, up to the level of 29 billion euros.
So this issue will also be on the agenda for talks between Emmanuel Macron and his host Xi Jinping, starting this Monday evening at the first dinner, and Tuesday night at the pre-dinner product launch in Shanghai, whereas France which seeks to participate in the Chinese market, is a guest of honor.
French President Emmanuel Macron is accompanied by fifty leaders of various companies, such as Airbus, Oreal, Sanof, but also SMEs, Devialet and Deezer.
