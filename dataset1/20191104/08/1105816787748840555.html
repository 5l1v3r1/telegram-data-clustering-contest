      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:56:54+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>In the spirit of Halloween, NASA took to Facebook to share a spine-chilling photo of the sun.</p>
      <p>The image was taken back in 2014, which shows “active regions” on the sun creating the illusion of a Jack-o-lantern style face.</p>
      <p>“Even our star celebrates the spooky season,” said NASA, encouraging people to download and repost the photo themselves as Halloween has just passed.</p>

      <p>The space agency explained that “This image blends together two sets of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths at 171 and 193 Ångströms, typically colourised in gold and yellow, to create a particularly Halloween-like appearance.”</p>
