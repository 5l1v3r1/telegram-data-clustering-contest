指中國《26條措施》惠台矛盾　總統府：顯得虛假與諷刺
04 Nov 2019, 08:51 by 吳妍, 吳貞慧
中國今公布對台《26條措施》，台資企業於5G、民航、融資等方面能享有當地企業同等待遇。在個人方面，中國駐外使館也接受台人求援和辦理旅行證件等業務。對此，總統府表示，《26條措施》實為「一國兩制台灣方案」的行動方案，且中國意圖以此框架台灣，此舉也損害台灣人民實質利益。
總統府發言人丁允恭表示，兩岸應對等互惠，不應名為惠台實為鎖台，且不管是31條或是26條，從過去的實證顯示，其所宣稱的效益有限，並未對台灣人民帶來實質利益，只是成為分化台灣社會、擾亂人心、干預台灣民主選舉進程的政治手段。
丁允恭也強調，若細究26條措施內容，可以發現「惠台」的矛盾，項是一面號稱提供外館協助，一面卻打壓我國外交發展，並宣稱歡迎運動員赴中參賽，另一邊卻在國際賽事上打壓台灣，稱此為惠台，顯得虛假與諷刺。
同時正告中國政府應停止對台灣的打壓，放棄「一國兩制台灣方案」，以此為前提才是兩岸發展正道。

Refers to China's ""26 measures"" Huitai contradiction. Presidential Palace: appears to be false and satirical
04 Nov 2019, 08:51 by Wu Hao, Wu Yuhui
China has announced the ""26 measures"" against Taiwan. Taiwan-funded enterprises can enjoy the same treatment as local enterprises in terms of 5G, civil aviation and financing. On the personal side, the Chinese embassy abroad also accepts Taiwanese people for assistance and travel documents. In this regard, the Presidential Palace stated that the ""26 Measures"" is actually a ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"" action plan, and China intends to use this framework to frame Taiwan, which also harms the Taiwan people's substantive interests.
Ding Yungong, a spokesperson for the presidential palace, said that cross-strait coping and reciprocity should not be called Huitai, and no matter whether it is 31 or 26, from the past empirical evidence, its declared benefits are limited and not for Taiwan. The people bring substantial benefits, but they are only a political means of differentiating Taiwanese society, disturbing people's hearts, and interfering with Taiwan's democratic election process.
Ding Yungong also stressed that if the contents of the 26 measures are carefully studied, the contradiction of ""Haitai"" can be found. The item is that one side claims to provide assistance from the foreign library, while the other side suppresses China's diplomatic development, and declares that athletes are welcome to participate in the competition, while the other side is in international competitions. On the suppression of Taiwan, calling this Huitai, it seems false and ironic.
At the same time, the Chinese government should stop suppressing Taiwan and abandon the ""one country, two systems Taiwan program"". This is the premise of cross-strait development.
