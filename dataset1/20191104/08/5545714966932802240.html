      <p>Arc System Works has dropped a bevy of treats for <i>Guilty Gear</i> fans this morning, with the reveal of two more characters, alongside all new gameplay footage, for its brand new, upcoming title in the hard-rockin' fighting game series.<br/><br/>The first of the new fighters is hipster ninja Chip Zanuff, a former American street gang member who has adopted a Japanese profile - as well as the art of ninjitsu - in order to better himself and redeem his prior reputation. A hugely popular character among GG players, Chip is an incredibly fast-moving fighter, capable of formidable aerial attack and practiced in teleportation arts.<i> </i><br/><br/>Potemkin is one of <i>Guilty Gear's</i> most recognisable characters. An elite member of the Zepp guard, Potemkin is an intelligent and philosophical individual, a personailty somewhat juxtaposed by his enormous frame and war-ready battle armour. As one of <i>GG's</i> primary tanks, Potemkin has to make two trips when he wants to haul ass, but is capable of incredible damage, while commanding a huge portion of the play area.</p>

      <p>The gameplay video, taken from the latest Arc-Nama live stream - gives us our first look at <i>New Guilty Gear's</i> gameplay outside of trailer montages, and features all of the revealed characters so far: Axl Low, Sol Badguy, Kykiske, May, Potemkin, and Chip Zanuff. I gotta say, these new character models are straight gorgeous.<br/><br/><br/><i>New Guilty Gear</i> (tentative title) is expected to launch on PS4 in 2020. A demo will be available to play at the ArcRevo World Tour Final 2019, held November 16 in Irvine, CA.</p>
