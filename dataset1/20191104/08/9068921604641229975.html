Because of the limited scope of the sale, we aren't sure how long it will last, so be sure to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTMMX9J/?tag=macrumors-20&amp;th=1">head over to Amazon</a> soon to check out the iPad Air if you're interested. <br/><br/>Apple updated these models of the iPad Air back in March 2019 with a new 10.5-inch display size, a Touch ID Home button, headphone jack, A12 Bionic processor, Apple Pencil support, and Smart Keyboard compatibility. The model on sale today is the high-end configuration of this line with Wi-Fi and cellular, as well as a 256GB storage capacity. <br/><br/>For more information on the latest Apple sales, be sure to visit our full <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Deals Roundup</a>.</p>
