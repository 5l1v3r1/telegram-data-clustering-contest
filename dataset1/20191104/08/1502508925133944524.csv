A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta took serious note of crop burning in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and said it cannot go unabated every year.
""Can we survive in this atmosphere? This is not the way we can survive,"" the bench said.
""Delhi is choking every year and we are not able to do anything. Question is that every year this is happening,"" the bench said, adding, ""It cannot be done in a civilised country"".
