      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/">Travel</a> disruption is also anticipated in these areas, as some major bridges have issued restriction warnings due to the possibility of high winds.</p>
      <p>A 40mph speed limit and a closure to double decker buses has been put into place on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/forth-road-bridge">Forth Road Bridge</a> .</p>
      <p>Drivers of double decker buses have also been told to avoid the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tay-bridge">Tay Road Bridge</a> for much of Monday.</p>
      <p>Officials and Cromarty, Dornoch and Kessock bridges have also issued out high wind cautions due to high winds.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Met Office said: “Further heavy rain may cause some flooding and disruption to travel.</p>
      <p>“Spray and flooding on roads probably making journey times longer.</p>
      <p>“Bus and train services may be affected with journey times taking longer.</p>
      <p>“Flooding of a few homes and business is possible.”</p>
