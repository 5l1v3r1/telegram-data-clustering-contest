      <h1>Labour pledges to save free TV licences as general election campaign hots up</h1>
      <h2>Tom Watson unveiled the eye-catching policy exclusively to the Mirror</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Morning,</p>
      <p>It's a (sadly, old-fashioned) mark of decency, honour and virtue that if you say you're going to do something, you should do it.</p>
      <p>That includes when it becomes uncomfortable, unpalatable or personally inconvenient.</p>
      <p>So when the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/free-tv-licences-over-75s-20803772">Conservatives promised to maintain free TV licences for the over-75s in the 2017 general election</a> , there were no caveats or get-out clauses; it seemed a straight pledge that millions of pensioners took at face value.</p>
      <p>But they reckoned without the sneakiness of the Tories, seeking to evade responsibility for their own commitments.</p>
      <p>And so began one of the more unedifying spectacles of this Parliament: Conservative ministers desperately trying to wriggle out of their own manifesto vow.</p>

      <p>Slippery Boris Johnson, who is obviously wary of the row brewing as the election campaign hots up, said at the weekend: "This needs sorting out urgently and I'll be talking to the BBC about how to sort that out."</p>
      <p>Well, for starters it “needed sorting out urgently” more than a year ago when the Mirror began warning of the threat to the benefit.</p>
      <p>Secondly, he has repeatedly tried to blame the BBC for Conservatives breaking a manifesto pledge.</p>
      <p>Labour, which introduced free licences in 1999, has seized on the Tory betrayal and campaigned, along with the Mirror and pensioner groups, to save them.</p>
      <p>Today, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/free-tv-licences-over-75s-20803772">we exclusively reveal how the party will step in and reverse the Conservatives' U-turn, safeguarding the vital lifeline</a> .</p>
      <p>Deputy Leader Tom Watson is unequivocal in his pledge: “Our message is clear, vote Labour to save free TV licences."</p>

      <p>Today hundreds of MPs will <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/most-powerful-job-politics-up-20803963">elect the new Commons Speaker to replace John Bercow</a> .</p>
      <p>Bercow was a divisive figure who did much to modernise Parliament but was accused of partisanship.</p>
      <p>Westminster watchers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/most-powerful-job-politics-up-20803963">all have their favourites of who they would like to succeed him</a> .</p>
      <p>But one thing we should all agree on is the new Speaker should be less of a star and more of an impartial umpire.</p>

      <p>As one of the candidates said, observers want to remember the game, not the referee.</p>
