12 memorable quotes from Benni at CT City

04 Nov 2019, 08:57

Cape Town - In an early Monday morning shocker, Absa Premiership side Cape Town City sacked head coach Benni McCarthy.
""Cape Town City Football Club has terminated the employment of coach Benni McCarthy, with immediate effect following a run of performance that saw the club win two in the last 18 games,"" the statement read that was released.
Assistant coach Vasili Manousakis will keep an eye on the squad on an interim basis as the club finalises the first team's new mentor.
McCarthy arrived at City in June 2017 and claimed a runners-up MTN8 medal in 2017. The following year, the former Bafana Bafana striker guided the Citizens side to the 2018 MTN8 title against SuperSport United in the final.
The 41-year-old has never been shy in sharing his views and over the past two years at the club, he certainly has gotten a lot off his chest during his pre- and post-match interviews.
The following are 12 memorable quotes from the South African soccer legend during his time as head coach of Cape Town City:

1. Benni slams standard of PSL referees


""But I say this every week now‚ since I've started my coaching career. Every game I've not been happy with the referee with their decision-making, when you score legitimate goals and then it gets disallowed without even giving the coaches an explanation on why."" -

2. Benni apologises for foul-mouthed reaction

3. Benni lashes out at City of CT in scathing open letter


""It is a dark day for football.
