NASA just dropped a picture that looks eerie
04 Nov 2019, 08:56 by Tech Desk
In the spirit of Halloween, NASA took to Facebook to share a spine-chilling photo of the sun.
The image was taken back in 2014, which shows “active regions” on the sun creating the illusion of a Jack-o-lantern style face.
“Even our star celebrates the spooky season,” said NASA, encouraging people to download and repost the photo themselves as Halloween has just passed.



The space agency explained that “This image blends together two sets of extreme ultraviolet wavelengths at 171 and 193 Ångströms, typically colourised in gold and yellow, to create a particularly Halloween-like appearance.”



This complicated definition makes quite a spooky photo of the sun which looks eery enough to send some chills
