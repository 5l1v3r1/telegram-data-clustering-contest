04 Nov 2019, 08:56

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】新唐人為讀者推薦每日精彩文章和視頻節目：
北京巨變前夜 所有掌權者都沒想到要完蛋了【編者按】：現今中國社會危機處於爆發、蔓延、极度惡化狀態，民怒爆煲一觸即發。翻看歷史發現，中共的現狀與大清朝滅亡前的景象驚人相似。越來越多的觀察人士以借古喻今的方式，暗示中國正處於大變局的前夜。
香港不是孤軍奮戰《啟示錄》預言中共末日中共四中全會後，港府再度升級鎮壓抗爭者的力度，這場持續了5個月的「水革命」流向何方，似乎看不到方向。但有香港大律師表示，港人不是孤軍奮戰，「國際戰線」要拉開。而《香港啟示錄》中預言，中共可能因香港問題走向末日。
章家敦：中共是21世紀納粹 美國須全方位脫鉤美中雙方正在推動簽署第一階段貿易協議，但美國著名評論家暨中國問題專家章家敦（Gordon Chang）認為，協議不會改變中共竊取知識產權、輸出其專制影響力的企圖。他指出，中共是「21世紀的納粹德國」，美國必須全方位與中共脫鉤，以維持世界強權的地位。
習近平重要講話遭王滬寧封殺 港媒質疑習近平日前在上海考察調研期間，提及中共的民主是一種「全過程的民主」。但習的相關講話，遭到王滬寧所掌控的黨媒封殺。親北京港媒均對此感到不解，並質疑背後是否另有玄機。
林鄭赴京內幕流出 商界為其準備「後事」英媒放風北京有意撤換林鄭月娥之時，傳出林鄭將於6日赴京，與分管港澳事務的中共常委韓正會面。有港媒說，因時間倉促，北京來不及撤換林鄭，此次會面或授意她繼續當傀儡，加大力度打壓港人抗爭。但香港商界已等不及了，正在為她準備「後事」，尋找特首接班人。
林鄭月娥連累全家 逾12萬人連署撤其英國籍香港反送中運動已持續了五個月，港府仍未解決民眾訴求，甚至動用港警暴力鎮壓行為越發嚴重，外界呼籲英國應撤銷推動《逃犯條例》修訂草案的港府官員及其家人的英國國籍等。10月，有網友在Change.org請願網站發起連署，要求英國政府撤銷香港特首林鄭月娥一家人的英國國籍，截至目前該連署數已突破12萬人。
重慶副書記任學鋒離奇死亡 傳跳樓自殺因缺席重慶市重要會議引發關注後，重慶市委副書記任學鋒被官媒證實已死亡。重慶方面的消息稱，任學鋒曾經墮樓送醫院搶救，也有網上消息稱，任「自殺身亡」死於北京。
中共輪番運動式折騰 民營企業家陷恐慌剛剛結束的中共四中全會明確定調「國進民退」大方向，近日，一名大陸學者批評中共當局折騰私企的言論在網路熱傳。該學者表示，中國民營企業家陷入恐慌，因為「公權太任性了」。他披露，中共輪番的運動式折騰，拖欠民營企業10多萬億不還，民營企業家沒有一個過的好的。
網紅郭美美出獄後 曬海外逍遙生活照大陸炫富女郭美美出獄不久便炫富曬出百萬卡地亞飾品，如今再炫自己在海外逍遙快活的旅遊照片。從她晒出的照片可見，其消費的檔次很高，其容貌也與剛出獄時大有變化。
美對華為出口禁令背後考量 前高官:華為壟斷5G將接管互聯網華為禁令的臨時豁免許可即將於11月19日到期，外界均密切關注美國商務部會否再次向美國企業發放有限度的華為禁令豁免許可證的問題，並猜測美中如果達成了第一階段的協議，美方會否鬆動對華為的封殺力度。對此，有美國媒體發文分析了美國政府對華為實施禁售令背後的考量，指出有關禁令打破了華為可能成為全球通訊設備壟斷者而帶來的網絡安全威脅。
香港警黑合作引恐慌 學防身術者人數爆增自香港反送中以來，在港府的縱容下，港警越來越肆無忌憚的瘋狂鎮壓港民。此外，還有具有黑道背景的人襲擊港人，被認為「警黑合作」。有港媒報導指出，報名防身術課程的市民至今多了3到4倍，相信是因為缺乏安全感，所以希望有能力自衛。
大陸佛寺宣誓「忠黨愛國」 老僧透露：被逼的中共當局以無神論立國，強制宗教界上演忠黨愛國等鬧劇，各地寺廟、僧人被強迫宣誓「忠黨愛國」、「共築中國夢」、唱「紅歌」等。有年邁信徒憤慨斥責，如今佛門淨地在中共強權下，正宗的佛教教義已逐漸消失。
香港11.3抗爭兩記者被拘 議員耳朵被咬掉（視頻）11月3日，港島太古城中心舉行人鏈抗議活動，警方闖入抓捕多人，其中包括2名記者。當晚，一名說普通話的持刀男子在商城外瘋狂砍殺民眾，至少6人受傷，2人危殆。暴徒還凶殘地將一名區議員的左耳朵咬掉一塊，民眾衝上前解救，痛毆暴徒。但警方卻放縱暴徒，令民眾質疑。
港警催淚彈誤炸自己人 港民鼓掌歡呼：自食其果（視頻）香港民主抗爭運動本週末繼續延燒。週六抗議者在香港多個地區發起了多場集會活動，有數十名抗議人士被警方逮捕。當警方在香港灣仔修頓球場試圖驅散抗議人群時，意外發生了催淚彈在警方防線上空爆炸事件。有網民隨後在網絡上曝光了一名警員疑因吸入催淚煙後身體不適而躲入小巷中跪地休息的照片和相關視頻，眾多網民紛紛留言嘲笑港警「自食其果」。
談判獲「巨大進展」？白宮高官對貿易協議樂觀智利取消主辦亞太經濟合作組織（APEC）峰會後，外界關注原定在這次峰會上簽署的美中第一階段貿易協議會否因此生變。最近兩天，美國商務部長羅斯和白宮經濟顧問庫德洛先後對媒體表示，美中談判雙方在多項領域取得了很大進展，他們都對美中在近期正式簽署首階段協議表示持樂觀態度。
撤換傳言不止 韓正週三公開見林鄭料談香港香港行政長官林鄭月娥本月5日結束在上海的活動後，將赴北京出席粵港澳大灣區會議，並將於6日上午與分管港澳事務的中共國務院副總理韓正會面。據信屆時韓正將向林鄭下達中共四中全會作出的有關香港的具體指令，但不會涉及林鄭下台的問題。有港媒引述評論人士表示，料北京尚需林鄭在下台前替中共做盡「髒活」（DIRTY JOB）。

[Wonderful recommendation] Beijing eclipse eve / Lin Zheng went to Beijing insider

04 Nov 2019, 08:56

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] NTDTV recommends daily wonderful articles and video programs for readers:
On the eve of Beijing's great change, all those in power did not expect to be finished. [Editor's note]: Today's Chinese social crisis is exploding, spreading, and extremely deteriorating. The public anger is on the verge of exploding. Looking back at history, the current situation of the CCP is strikingly similar to the scene before the demise of the Qing Dynasty. More and more observers have hinted that China is on the eve of the big change.
Hong Kong is not alone. The ""Revelation"" predicts that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hong Kong Government will once again upgrade its efforts to suppress the protesters. It seems that the ""water revolution"" that lasted for five months has not seen the direction. However, some Hong Kong barristers said that the people of Hong Kong are not alone, and the ""international front"" is to be opened. The ""Hong Kong Revelation"" prophesies that the CCP may go to the end of the day because of the Hong Kong issue.
Zhang Jiadun: The CCP is a 21st century Nazi America must be completely decoupled. The United States and China are promoting the signing of the first phase of the trade agreement, but the famous American critic and Chinese expert Gordon Chang believes that the agreement will not change the CCP’s theft. Intellectual property, an attempt to export its authoritarian influence. He pointed out that the CCP is ""Nazi Germany in the 21st century."" The United States must decouple from the CCP in all aspects to maintain its status as a world power.
Xi Jinping's important speech was blocked by Wang Huning. Hong Kong media questioned that Xi Jinping mentioned during the investigation and study in Shanghai that the CCP's democracy is a ""democratic process."" However, Xi’s related speech was blocked by the party media controlled by Wang Huning. Pro-Beijing-Hong Kong media are puzzled by this and question whether there is another mystery behind it.
Lin Zheng went to Beijing to come out inside. The business community prepared for the ""afterthoughts"". When the British media released Beijing's intention to remove Lin Zhengyue, it was reported that Lin Zheng would go to Beijing on the 6th to meet with Han Zheng, the member of the Standing Committee of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs. Some Hong Kong media said that due to the rush of time, Beijing could not replace Lin Zheng. The meeting or instructed her to continue to be defamed and intensified efforts to suppress Hong Kong people's struggle. However, the Hong Kong business community has been unable to wait. She is preparing for her ""aftermath"" to find the successor to the chief executive.
Lin Zhengyue and his family have more than 120,000 people to withdraw their British nationality. The Hong Kong anti-delivery campaign has lasted for five months. The Hong Kong Government has still not resolved the people's demands, and even the use of the Hong Kong police violent suppression has become more serious. The outside world has called for the British to revoke the fugitives. The British nationality of Hong Kong officials and their families, as amended by the draft regulations. In October, some netizens launched a registration on the Change.org petition website, requesting the British government to revoke the British nationality of the Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue's family. As of now, the number of the company has exceeded 120,000.
Chongqing’s deputy secretary Ren Xuefeng’s bizarre death. After the suicide of the building was overwhelmed by the important meeting in Chongqing, Ren Xuefeng, deputy secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee, was confirmed dead by the official media. According to sources in Chongqing, Ren Xuefeng once sent a hospital to the hospital for rescue. There are also online news that he died in Beijing.
The CCP’s turn-around sports toss The private Chinese entrepreneurs’ panic-stricken CCP’s Fourth Plenary Session has clearly set the direction for “national advancement and retreat”. Recently, a mainland scholar criticized the Chinese Communist Party’s remarks about tossing private enterprises on the Internet. The scholar said that Chinese private entrepreneurs are in a panic because ""public power is too capricious."" He disclosed that the CCP’s reversal of sports-style tossing and owing more than 10 trillion yuan to private enterprises did not return, and private entrepreneurs did not have a good one.
After the net is released, the United States and the United States are released from the prison. The overseas rich and happy life, according to the mainland, show off the rich female Guo Meimei, and soon she will show off a million Cartier jewelry, and now she will show off her happy overseas travel photos. It can be seen from the photos she has exposed that the level of consumption is very high, and its appearance is also very different from when it was just released from prison.
Behind the US export ban on Huawei, the former high-ranking official: Huawei's monopoly 5G will take over the Internet Huawei ban, the temporary exemption permit will expire on November 19, the outside world is closely watching whether the US Department of Commerce will issue a limited Huawei ban to US companies again. The question of exempting the license, and guessing whether the US will reach the first phase of the agreement, will the US loose the ban on Huawei. In response, the US media published an analysis of the US government's consideration of the implementation of the ban on Huawei, pointing out that the ban broke the cybersecurity threat that Huawei may become a monopoly of global communications equipment.
Hong Kong police black cooperation led to panic The number of self-defense practitioners has increased since Hong Kong's counter-delivery. Under the connivance of the Hong Kong government, the Hong Kong police have increasingly unscrupulously suppressed the Hong Kong people. In addition, there are people with a background in the underworld who attacked Hong Kong people and are considered to be ""police-black cooperation."" Some Hong Kong media reports pointed out that the number of citizens who applied for self-defense courses has been three to four times more. I believe that because of the lack of security, I hope to have the ability to defend myself.
The mainland Buddhist temple swears ""loyal party patriotism"" Laojiao revealed: The forced CCP authorities established a state of atheism and forced the religious circles to stage loyalty and patriotism, and temples and monks were forced to swear ""loyal party patriotism"" and ""build a Chinese dream together"" Sing ""Red Song"" and so on. There are elderly believers who indignantly reprimanded. Nowadays, under the CCP’s power, the authentic Buddhist teachings have gradually disappeared.
Hong Kong 11.3 protested against two reporters who were detained by the leg of the parliament (video) On November 3, the Hong Kong Island Taikoo Shing Center held a chain of people protests, and the police broke into many people, including two reporters. That night, a man with a Mandarin-speaking knife slashed the people outside the mall, at least 6 people were injured and 2 were critical. The mob also fiercely bit the piece of the left ear of a district board member, and the people rushed forward to save and scream the mob. However, the police indulged the mob and made the people question.
Hong Kong police tear gas bombs their own people Hong Kong people applauded and cheered: self-satisfaction (video) Hong Kong's democratic protest movement continued to burn this weekend. On Saturday, protesters launched a number of gatherings in various parts of Hong Kong, and dozens of protesters were arrested by the police. When the police tried to disperse the protesters at the Southorn Stadium in Wanchai, Hong Kong, a tear gas bomb exploded in the police to prevent an online bombing. Some netizens then exposed photos and related videos of a police officer who was suspected of hiding in the alleys due to physical discomfort after inhaling tears. Many netizens replied that the Hong Kong police ""satisfed their own food.""
Negotiations have been ""great progress""? Senior White House officials are optimistic about the trade agreement After Chile canceled the hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the outside world is concerned about whether the US-China first-phase trade agreement originally signed at the summit will change. In the past two days, US Secretary of Commerce Ross and White House economic adviser Kudlow have told the media that the US-China negotiating parties have made great progress in various fields. They are all optimistic that the US and China will formally sign the first phase agreement in the near future.
The rumors are not only Han Zheng’s public meeting on Wednesday, Lin Zheng said that Hong Kong’s Hong Kong Chief Executive Lin Zhengyue will go to Beijing to attend the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao Dawan District meeting after the event ends in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, and will be in charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs on the morning of the 6th. Han Zheng, vice premier of the State Council, met. It is believed that Han Zheng will issue specific instructions to Hong Kong to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, but will not address the issue of Lin Zheng’s stepping down. Some Hong Kong media quoted commentators as saying that Beijing still needs Lin Zheng to do DIRTY JOB for the Chinese Communist Party before he stepped down.
