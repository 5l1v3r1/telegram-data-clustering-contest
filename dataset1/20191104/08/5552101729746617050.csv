《水行俠》導演溫子仁娶女模　狗狗見證完婚引用《魔戒》台詞

以《奪魂鋸》成功打響名號，繼而以《陰兒房》《厲陰宅》奠定恐怖片票房導演地位，動作片《玩命關頭7》在台灣締造賣座成績，之後又打造《水行俠》賣座電影，導演溫子仁對於觀眾來說就是橫跨票房類型的賣座保證。正在忙著拍攝個人生涯第10部片的溫子仁，在Instagram宣告自己結婚了。
出生在馬來西亞，在澳洲就讀電影科系的溫子仁（James Wan），與學校同學雷沃納爾一起完成了《奪魂鋸》（Saw）劇本，由於當時他們根本沒有任何拍片的經驗，得不到任何資金，於是只好把其中一段改拍成短片，向大家證明自己的功力。這段短片果然讓他們順利籌措到拍攝資金，《奪魂鋸》最後也在北美票房賣座突破1億美金。
後來的事情，就成為獨立影壇最津津樂道的故事，溫子仁如何接二連三用恐怖片突圍，並且以《厲陰宅》讓他得到拍攝《玩命關頭7》的執導機會，證明了他對各種電影類型的駕輕就熟。
雖然溫子仁的前作《水行俠》叫好叫座，但他決定趁著續集計畫還沒上軌道之際，搶先開拍一部他心目中的「小片」，當然也是一部恐部片，因為女主角就是《安娜貝爾》的女星安娜貝爾瓦歷斯。只是當外界都在猜測這部片倒底是不是「厲陰宅宇宙」之際，溫子仁又再次跌破大眾的眼鏡，在Instagram上宣布婚訊，跟女模英格麗畢蘇（Ingrid Bisu）結婚。
他在Instagram上，引用電影《魔戒》的經典台詞，「至尊戒、馭眾戒」，表示2人戴上婚戒後，就要臣服戒指的力量囉！而且他強調結婚儀式，是在家裡2隻狗狗的見證下完成的，相當有趣而低調。

Later events became the most talked about story in the independent film industry. How did Wen Ziren take the horror film to break through and use the film ""Li Yin Zhai"" to give him the opportunity to shoot ""Lifetime 7"" and prove his various movie types. The car is familiar.
Although Wen Ziren's predecessor, ""Water Man"", was a good place to call, but he decided to take a sequel to the ""small film"" in his mind when he was still on the track. Of course, it was also a terror movie because the heroine was ""Annabel"" actress Annabel Walis. Only when the outside world is speculating whether this film is ""Li Yin House Universe"", Wen Ziren once again fell below the public glasses, announced the marriage on Instagram, married the female model Ingrid Bisu .
On Instagram, he quoted the classic lines of the movie ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Extreme Ring, and the Ring of the Rings"", indicating that after wearing a wedding ring, two people will surrender the power of the ring!
