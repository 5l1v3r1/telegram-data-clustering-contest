      <h1>Ross McCrorie discipline questioned as Rangers loanee is hooked despite man of the match performance</h1>
      <h2>The 21-year-old was replaced with five minutes to go and Portsmouth ended up conceding a late equaliser.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:48:17+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Kenny Jackett has revealed fears <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-mccrorie">Ross McCrorie</a> would be sent off prompted him to sub the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-u21s-football-team">Scotland U21</a> captain in a 1-1 draw with Oxford.</p>
      <p>McCrorie was named man of the match during the game but the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> loanee was hooked with his side a goal up.</p>
      <p>Oxford found an equaliser in the last minute and Jackett was criticised for his decision with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/portsmouth-fc">Portsmouth</a> in poor form and sitting 15th in League One.</p>
      <p>But the Pompey boss has defended the move and insists it was down to red card fears for McCrorie.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old was sent off on his Portsmouth debut and has struggled to get a regular role in the team since.</p>

      <p>He has got back in while playing right back and the versatile youngster was the best player on the pitch on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But he was booked for a first half tackle on Josh Ruffels and Jackett told the <a href="https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/portsmouth-fc/portsmouth-boss-kenny-jackett-reveals-why-he-substituted-rangers-loanee-ross-mccrorie-against-oxford-united-1-9128241">Portsmouth News:</a> "It was just to make sure Ross didn’t get sent off.</p>
      <p>"He was on a booking and there are sometimes situations he puts himself into. I didn’t want to go down to 10 men.</p>
      <p>"Ross was on a yellow and then made a foul mid-way through the second half, where it did look like one more and that could be it.</p>
      <p>"He brought a lot to our game and is learning all the time. In terms of bookings, he has to be careful and learn from that – and he can and will keep improving.</p>
      <p>"He has found his feet now, there have been quite a number of changes in the summer and he is one of them. I am pleased with him.</p>
      <p>"We persevered with him and there is a player there, definitely."</p>
