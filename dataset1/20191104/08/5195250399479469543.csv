Hero, Honda, TVS, Bajaj, Suzuki, RE – October 2019 Sales Analysis
04 Nov 2019, 08:00 by Surendhar M
October 2019 has turned out to be a recovery month for the Indian two-wheeler industry as most of the mainstream brands posted decent sales
In October 2019, two-wheeler manufacturers had been able to recover some of the lost ground courtesy of the festive season and the big level of discounts offered across the board. Hero MotoCorp hit a record retail sales tally of 12.84 lakh units last month and the Month-on-Month numbers were not bad either.
The largest two-wheeler maker in the country posted a total of 5,99,248 units last month as against 7,16,059 units with YoY de-growth of 16.31%. However, on MoM terms, the sales decrease was only 4% as 6,24,215 were retailed in September 2019. Honda, on the other hand, continued to be second with a total of 4,87,782 units.
It was not too dissimilar from what it managed during the same month in 2018 as 4,90,124 units were sold. The YoY de-growth stood only at negative 0.48%. In the Month-on-Month comparison, the Japanese manufacturer did deliver as 4,55,896 units were sold in October 2018 that resulted in a very decent 6.99% sales increase.
