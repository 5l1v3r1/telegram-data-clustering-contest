      <p>The protest movement that led to the removal of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sudan.html">Sudan</a>'s longtime President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/omar-bashir.html">Omar al-Bashir</a> has said it is not against handing over the deposed ruler to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to be tried for alleged atrocities in Darfur.</p>
      <p>Al-Bashir, who was toppled by the army in April in the face of months-long protests against his rule, has long been wanted by the Hague-based <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/icc.html">ICC</a> on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the devastating conflict in the western region of Darfur.</p>

      <p>"We have no objection in handing over Bashir to the ICC," Ibrahim Al-Sheikh, a leader of umbrella protest movement the Forces of Freedom and Change, told reporters late on Sunday. "All the members of the Forces of Freedom and Change agree on that."</p>
      <p>Al-Bashir is currently being held in a prison in Khartoum, facing trial on corruption charges. He ruled Sudan for three decades after seizing power in a coup in 1989.</p>
      <p>Global rights groups, rebel factions who fought al-Bashir's forces over the years and activists have consistently demanded that the former leader be handed over to the ICC.</p>
      <p>After he was deposed on April 11, ICC prosecutors once again demanded al-Bashir stand trial for mass killings in Darfur.</p>
      <p>The military generals who had initially seized power in the aftermath of the president's fall have refused to hand him over to the ICC.</p>
      <p>The country has since August been ruled by a joint civilian-military sovereign council, which includes leaders of the protest umbrella. The body is tasked with overseeing the transition to full civilian rule.</p>
      <p>The transitional authorities would need to ratify the ICC's Rome Statute to allow for the transfer of al-Bashir to the Hague.</p>
      <h3>Sunday protests</h3>
      <p>Also on Sunday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and across the country.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations were organised by local groups linked with the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which spearheaded the uprising against al-Bashir.</p>
      <p>In Khartoum, the protesters called on authorities to step up an investigation into the hundreds of people who went missing on June 3, when security forces dispersed the main sit-in outside the military headquarters.</p>
      <p>According to the protesters, at least 128 people were killed and hundreds went missing. Authorities put the death toll at 87, including 17 inside the sit-in area.</p>
      <p>Dura Gambo, an activist with the SPA, said the demonstrators wanted to know the fate of those who disappeared in the June crackdown.</p>
      <p>"If they are alive, where are they, and if they were dead, where are their bodies? This what we want to know," she said.</p>
      <p>The protesters carried posters of the missing people, and marched to the office of the country's chief prosecutor, where they presented officials with written demands for a new investigation by an independent committee.</p>
      <p>Protesters already rejected the results of the prosecutor's investigation in September, which said the country's ruling generals did not order the deadly break-up and blamed the deaths on paramilitary forces who exceeded their orders.</p>
      <p>Setting up an independent probe into the crackdown was a key point in the transition deal between the military and civilian leaders signed in August.</p>
      <p>The new government has a three-year period to steer the country towards elections.</p>
      <p>Sunday's rallies also took at aim at the lingering influence of al-Bashir's political system, including his National Congress Party.</p>
      <p>Footage circulated online showing the mostly young protesters in the city of Wad Madani, the provincial capital of al-Jazirah province, waving Sudanese flags and calling for the former ruling party's dissolution, as well as the resignation of the local governor whom al-Bashir had appointed.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of any clashes with police or casualties during the protests.</p>
      <p>The transitional government previously said it would not appoint governors or an interim parliament until it makes peace with the country's rebel groups.</p>
      <p>The first round of peace talks between government and rebel leaders took place in October in neighbouring South Sudan's capital, Juba. They are expected to resume later this month.</p>
