Mgomo waendelea kuathiri uchumi wa Iraq
04 Nov 2019, 08:03 by RFI

Waandamanaji kwenye mji mkuu wa Iraq na Kusini mwa nchi hiyo wamefunga barabara na ofisi za Serikali katika kile ambacho kinaelezwa ni mfululizo wa mgomo wa kutotii Serikali wakishinikiza mabadiliko ya mfumo mzima wa kisiasa.

Maandamano yalianza Oktoba Mosi mwaka huu ambapo wananchi walikuwa wanapinga kukithiri kwa vitendo vya rushwa na ukosefu wa ajira nchini Iraq.
Hata hivyo waandamanaji walikabiliwa na nguvu kubwa ya Serikali ambapo ilitumia jeshi na polisi kujaribu kuzima maandamano ambayo yalikuwa yameanza kuenea nchi nzima.
Maandamano hayo sasa yamepata uungwaji mkono kutoka kwa wanafunzi wa shule za Sekondari, vyuo vikuu na mashirikisho ya vyama vya wafanyakazi ambao nao wameamua kuingia barabarani kushinikiza Serikali kujiuzulu.
Viongozi wa maandamano haya wameapa kuendelea kufunga ofisi za Serikali na barabara hadi pale wale iliyowaita wala rushwa watakapoondoka mamlakani.

The strike continues to affect Iraq's economy
04 Nov 2019, 08:03 by RFI

Protesters in the Iraqi capital and the southern part of the country have shut down government roads and offices in what is described as a series of strikes of disobedience to the Government forcing a change in the entire political system.

The protests began in October this year when citizens were protesting against the corruption and unemployment in Iraq.
However the protesters were confronted by a massive State force that used the army and police to try to quell the protests that had begun to spread across the country.
The protest has now received support from high school students, universities and trade unions who have also decided to take to the streets to push the government to resign.
The leaders of the protest have vowed to continue closing government offices and roads until the so-called corrupt officials leave office.
