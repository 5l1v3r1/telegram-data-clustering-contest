用眼過度好疲勞，使用器具震動「按摩眼球」可以嗎？
04 Nov 2019, 08:01 by 照護線上


我們想讓你知道的是針對眼睛不適，大家時常以眼藥水、眼球按摩、桌上放置綠色植物，或把手機螢幕設置成綠色等方式改善，但這樣做真的有效嗎？



相信大家都有類似的經驗，在長時間使用3C產品後，會覺得眼睛很不舒服，為何眼睛會感到痠痛、疲勞呢？
眼科王孟祺醫師表示，若長時間盯著近距離的手機、電腦螢幕或文件，眼睛裡的睫狀肌，還有瞳孔的括約肌都需要持續收縮，久了之後就會覺得痠痛跟疲勞。除了肌肉的問題之外，眼睛在專注看東西的時候眨眼次數會減少，淚水容易蒸發，視力會感到不穩定。要更加專注地看東西，會讓眼睛更加吃力。
如果小朋友長期使用3C產品，因為眼球還在發育階段，可能會讓近視加深，導致長大後高度近視的比例較高，美國小兒科醫學會不建議3歲以前的孩童使用3C產品。對一般的上班族來說，使用3C產品會讓眼睛感覺到痠澀、疲勞跟乾燥。
針對眼睛不適，大家時常以眼藥水、眼球按摩、桌上放置綠色植物，或把手機螢幕設置成綠色等方式改善，但這樣做真的有效嗎？
有的人會自行使用藥水，這些藥水有時候可能含有類固醇，或者可能有血管收縮劑，或是有抗生素的成分在裡面，使用者可能不甚清楚，最好不要任意使用。
王孟祺醫師舉例道，長期使用類固醇藥水可能導致青光眼或是白內障，而有些眼藥水可能會讓警覺性的症狀不見，比如說發炎、乾燥、有些上皮缺損時眼睛會充血，如果自行購買有血管收縮劑的眼藥水點用，這些充血情況暫時性改善了，使用者以為眼睛的問題解決了，事實上沒有反而導致病情延誤。
例如有許多女性朋友喜歡配戴角膜變色片，當工作時間過長，往往會造成乾燥缺氧，還會造成眼睛表面慢慢變得不健康，很多案例是配戴角膜變色片配戴過久後眼睛會紅，而自行購買藥妝店眼藥水點用，點用後眼睛不紅就覺得沒有事情又繼續配戴。
角膜是眼睛裡面很特殊的組織，是能透光的組織，要完全透明才能看見東西。長期缺氧的情況下，內皮細胞跟上皮細胞變得很不健康，霧霧的很像毛玻璃，散光會變得非常深，不管戴眼鏡或是隱形眼鏡看東西都會霧霧的。醫師都建議要停戴，但是很多女性朋友不願意停戴，一定要等到真的都看不清楚了，才覺得事情嚴重。
王孟祺醫師強調，使用眼藥水一定要諮詢眼科醫師，看看哪種藥水有幫助。

按壓眼球，萬萬不可
有些人會使用器具幫忙按摩，臨床上有看過患者用按摩棒震動按摩眼球，導致視網膜剝離，非常危險。眼球是一個非常脆弱的組織，所以四面都有骨頭保護，按摩時切記不可以按摩眼球本體，壓到眼球可能造成視網膜損害。如果眼壓過高，本身有青光眼的患者也是比較危險的行為。
想保護眼睛，王孟祺醫師建議要望遠，不管是綠色或其他顏色，都可以讓肌肉放鬆。有人會在桌上擺植栽，但是基本上看近距離的綠色，眼睛還是需要調節用力，所以建議要看遠方。如果又有綠色植物可以看，當然更心曠神怡。
過度使用3C常常感到眼睛痠麻脹痛，怎麼做才能有效的護眼？
建議要定鬧鐘，每30分鐘，休息10－15分鐘，但事實上因為工作真的沒辦法休息那麼長的時間。所以至少要站起來，走一走動一下肩頸背部，做一些放鬆的體操也順便多眨眨眼睛。如果有窗外可以看讓眼睛望遠1－2分鐘時間，幫助眼睛肌肉放鬆調節焦距。
王孟祺醫師指出，眼睛是對睡眠需求相當高的器官，只要睡眠不足眼睛肌肉會感到無力，看東西也較不清楚，而且睡眠不足往往伴隨眼睛乾燥的問題。建議長期近距離使用眼睛，或者已經比較乾燥，能夠在下班後熱敷，或者上班中間休息時熱敷，溫度40－45度，熱敷5－10分鐘左右，可幫助改善眼睛不適。
葉黃素、蝦紅素，傻傻分不清楚？
葉黃素、蝦紅素等營養素都是屬於比較能夠抗氧化的營養素，人會老化是因為在氧化過程中產生很多游離基，而讓細胞漸漸老化甚至慢慢凋亡，這些抗氧化劑可以幫助減少氧化作用的壓力。
葉黃素跟蝦紅素都是屬於類胡蘿蔔素，類胡蘿蔔素是天然的色素。葉黃素可以存在眼睛的黃斑部裡，能吸收有害光線，還有抗氧化跟抗發炎的作用。王孟祺醫師表示，根據研究，這兩項是有一定需求的營養素，且人體無法自行合成，要從飲食中攝取，或是從營養補充劑攝取。

葉黃素：葉黃素在黃色玉米、綠色花椰菜、綠葉蔬菜、蛋黃中的含量很高。葉黃素是脂溶性，吸收後會慢慢累積，如果可以長期攝取葉黃素，黃斑部的葉黃素濃度夠，對於眼睛黃斑部退化狀況，有預防效果。蝦紅素雖然也是類胡蘿蔔素，但是並不會在黃斑部聚集，所以蝦紅素沒有辦法取代葉黃素。
蝦紅素：蝦紅素主要存在於蝦、蟹、水藻、紅藻中，蝦紅素可以防止紫外線的傷害，還可以有活絡血液循環的作用。蝦紅素比較特殊具有脂溶性及水溶性，所以可以比較廣泛性存在。這兩種裡面抗氧化效力最強的是蝦紅素，蝦紅素跟葉黃素不同的是無法在體內長期累積，短期在眼睛比較疲勞的時候，補充較強的抗氧化劑，能消除眼睛疲勞。

蝦紅素不是蝦？素食可食用？
蝦紅素是由諾貝爾得主Dr. Kuhn在龍蝦身上發現，加上龍蝦顏色鮮紅，因而取名為蝦紅素。但目前蝦紅素其實提取自紅藻，只要海洋生物食用後都會含有蝦紅素，常見於蝦子、螃蟹、鮭魚、龍蝦等海洋動物體內，所以素食是可以食用的。
由於蝦紅素基本上人體是無法自行合成，但食物中的蝦紅素含量也多不高，加上現代人大多外食，營養上的攝取容易不均衡，因此王孟祺醫師也建議，平日可透過相關保健食品來補充人體所需營養素。
補充蝦紅素時要注意什麼？
根據日本藤田保健大學的研究，每日攝取量4毫克，就可以達到放鬆睫狀肌的效果，不需要補充特別的多。王孟祺醫師表示，因為蝦紅素本身就是一個很強的抗氧化劑，可以在感覺特別疲勞的時候，適時補充。葉黃素與蝦紅素有不同的生理功能，無法取代彼此，可一併補充。

Excessive fatigue with the eyes, can you use the instrument to shake the ""mass eyeball""?
04 Nov 2019, 08:01 by care line


What we want you to know is for eye discomfort. Everyone often improves with eye drops, eye massage, placing green plants on the table, or setting the screen of the phone to green. But is this really effective?



I believe that everyone has similar experience. After using 3C products for a long time, I feel that my eyes are very uncomfortable. Why do my eyes feel sore and tired?
Ophthalmology Dr. Wang Mengxi said that if you stare at close-range mobile phones, computer screens or files for a long time, the ciliary muscles in your eyes and the sphincters of the pupils need to continue to contract. After a long time, you will feel sore and tired. In addition to the problem of muscles, the number of blinks will decrease when the eyes are focused on seeing things, the tears will easily evaporate, and the vision will feel unstable. Looking at things more focused will make your eyes more difficult.
If children use 3C products for a long time, because the eyeball is still developing, it may make myopia deepen, resulting in a higher proportion of high myopia after growing up. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend 3C products for children before the age of 3. For the average office worker, using 3C products will make the eyes feel sour, tired and dry.
For eye discomfort, people often improve with eye drops, eye massage, green plants on the table, or set the phone screen to green, but is this really effective?
Some people use their own medicines. These medicines may sometimes contain steroids, or they may have vasoconstrictors, or ingredients with antibiotics. Users may not know, and it is best not to use them arbitrarily.
Dr. Wang Mengqi exemplified that long-term use of steroids may cause glaucoma or cataracts, and some eye drops may cause vigilant symptoms, such as inflammation, dryness, and some epithelial defects, which may cause congestion. If you purchase vasoconstrictors yourself The eye drops are used, and the congestion is temporarily improved. The user thinks that the problem of the eye has been solved, and in fact, it has not caused the disease to be delayed.
For example, many female friends like to wear corneal color-changing tablets. When working for too long, it often causes dryness and lack of oxygen. It also causes the surface of the eyes to become unhealthy. In many cases, the eyes are worn with long-term corneal discoloration tablets. Will be red, and buy the drug store eyedrops on their own, after using the eyes are not red, I feel that there is nothing to continue to wear.
The cornea is a very special tissue in the eye. It is a tissue that can transmit light. It must be completely transparent to see things. In the case of chronic hypoxia, endothelial cells and epithelial cells become very unhealthy. The fog is like a frosted glass, and the astigmatism will become very deep. Whether it is wearing glasses or contact lenses, it will fog. Physicians are advised to stop wearing, but many female friends are unwilling to stop wearing them. They must wait until they really can't see clearly, and they feel that things are serious.
Dr. Wang Mengyu emphasized that it is necessary to consult an ophthalmologist to see which potion is helpful.

Pressing the eye, never
Some people use the device to help with massage. It has been clinically seen that patients use the massage stick to vibrate the eyeball, causing the retina to peel off, which is very dangerous. The eyeball is a very fragile tissue, so there are bone protection on all sides. When you massage, remember not to massage the eyeball body. Pressing the eyeball may cause damage to the retina. If the eye pressure is too high, patients with glaucoma themselves are also more dangerous behavior.
Want to protect the eyes, Dr. Wang Mengyu suggested to look far, whether it is green or other colors, can relax the muscles. Some people will plant on the table, but basically look at the green at a close distance, the eyes still need to adjust the force, so it is recommended to look at the distance. If there are green plants to see, of course, more relaxed and happy.
Excessive use of 3C often feels sore eyes, how can I effectively protect my eyes?
It is recommended to set an alarm clock, every 10 minutes, rest for 10-15 minutes, but in fact because the work really can not rest for such a long time. So at least stand up, walk around the back of the neck and neck, do some relaxing gymnastics and also blink your eyes. If you have a window, you can look at the eyes for 1-2 minutes to help the eye muscles relax and adjust the focal length.
Dr. Wang Mengxi pointed out that the eyes are organs that have a relatively high demand for sleep. As long as the sleep is insufficient, the muscles of the eyes will feel weak, and the things that are seen are less clear, and the lack of sleep is often accompanied by dry eyes. It is recommended to use the eyes for a long time at a close distance, or it is already dry, can be hot after work, or hot during the rest of work, temperature 40-45 degrees, hot compress for 5-10 minutes, can help improve eye discomfort.
Lutein, astaxanthin, silly points are not clear?
Nutrients such as lutein and astaxanthin are relatively nutrients that can resist oxidation. People will age because they produce many free radicals during oxidation, and let the cells gradually age or even slowly decay. These antioxidants can help reduce The pressure of oxidation.
Both lutein and astaxanthin are carotenoids, and carotenoids are natural pigments. Lutein can be found in the macula of the eye, absorbs harmful light, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. According to Dr. Wang Mengxi, according to the research, these two are nutrients with certain needs, and the human body cannot synthesize by itself, and should be taken from the diet or from nutritional supplements.

Lutein: Lutein is high in yellow corn, green broccoli, green leafy vegetables, and egg yolk. Lutein is fat-soluble and will accumulate slowly after absorption. If lutein can be taken for a long time, the concentration of lutein in the macula is sufficient, and it has a preventive effect on the degeneration of the macula. Although astaxanthin is also a carotenoid, it does not accumulate in the macula, so there is no way to replace lutein.
Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is mainly found in shrimp, crab, algae, and red algae. Astaxanthin can prevent ultraviolet rays from harming and can also activate blood circulation. Astaxanthin is particularly fat-soluble and water-soluble, so it can be widely used. The two most potent antioxidants are astaxanthin, which is different from lutein in that it cannot accumulate in the body for a long time. In the short-term, when the eyes are fatigued, it can supplement the strong antioxidants and eliminate eye fatigue.

Is astaxanthin not a shrimp? Vegetarian food?
Astaxanthin is found in lobster by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Kuhn, and the lobster is bright red, hence the name asormosin. However, at present, astaxanthin is actually extracted from red algae. As long as marine organisms are eaten, they contain astaxanthin, which is commonly found in marine animals such as shrimps, crabs, squids, and lobsters. Therefore, vegetarian food is edible.
Because astaxanthin is basically unable to synthesize itself, but the content of astaxanthin in food is not high, and most people eat outside, the nutritional intake is easy to be uneven. Therefore, Dr. Wang Mengyu also suggested that it can be related through weekdays. Health foods to supplement the nutrients needed by the body.
What should I pay attention to when supplementing astaxanthin?
According to the research of Fujita Health University in Japan, the daily intake of 4 mg can achieve the effect of relaxing the ciliary muscle without special supplementation. Dr. Wang Mengxi said that because astaxanthin itself is a strong antioxidant, it can be replenished when it feels particularly tired. Lutein and astaxanthin have different physiological functions and cannot replace each other and can be supplemented together.
