日又一世遺遭祝融 合掌村附近小屋起火

04 Nov 2019, 08:08

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】日本沖繩縣擁有世界文化遺產的首里城，31日凌晨才發生大火，燒毀7棟建築。4日下午位於岐阜縣也是被列為世界遺產的「白川鄉」有建築物起火燃燒，目擊者稱看到火勢猛烈，還伴隨爆炸聲響，目前尚未傳出有人員受傷。白川鄉合掌村原訂今晚施以光雕的活動臨時取消。
消防單位表示，位於岐阜縣白川村荻町有世界遺產俗稱「合掌村」的「白川鄉與五箇山的合掌構造村落」附近小屋，今天下午2時40分（北京時間1時40分）左右，有民眾通報說「小屋起火」，立即出動至少3輛消防車滅火。



有人從火災現場附近拍攝火災情況，從影片看來，小屋後方有大火柱。有目擊者上傳訊息到推特表示，看到火勢猛烈；另有推友說，有聽到爆炸聲響，周邊濃煙密佈，火勢猛烈。
火災附近的商店的店員表示，起火的是小型的合掌建築，並非有人居住的小屋。另有商店人員表示，火災起火地點距離觀光客用的停車場很近，疑似是車庫起火。
當地警方表示，被燒毀的木屋不是世界文化遺產建築，距離聚落有一小段距離，並未延燒至其他建築。
據了解，發生火災的地方距離被列為重要文化財（重要古蹟）的「和田家住宅」等所在的合掌聚落約500公尺左右。為此，白川鄉合掌村原訂今天晚上要施以光雕的活動臨時取消。



這也是繼沖繩的琉球王國首里城大火後，又一個被聯合國教科文組織列為世界文化遺產的日本景點遭到祝融之災。

The firefighting unit said that there is a small house in the vicinity of the Shirakawa-go and the five-mountain-inhabited village of the village of Shirakawa, which is a world heritage site in Shirakawa-mura, Gifu Prefecture. At about 2:40 pm (1:40 pm Beijing time), there are people. The notice said that ""the hut was on fire"" and immediately fired at least three fire engines.



Some people took fires from the scene near the fire. From the film's point of view, there was a large fire column behind the hut. Some witnesses uploaded the message to Twitter and said that the fire was fierce. Another friend said that there was an explosion of sound, and the surrounding smoke was dense and the fire was fierce.
The clerk of the store near the fire said that the fire was a small palm-shaped building, not an inhabited cottage. Another store staff said that the location of the fire was very close to the parking lot for tourists, and it was suspected that the garage was on fire.
Local police said that the burned wooden house was not a World Heritage site, a short distance from the settlement and did not extend to other buildings.
It is understood that the place where the fire broke out is about 500 meters away from the ""Hita home"" which is listed as an important cultural property (important monument). To this end, Baichuan Township Hezhang Village originally scheduled to cancel the activities of light carvings tonight.
