習近平重要講話遭王滬寧封殺 港媒質疑

04 Nov 2019, 08:16

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】習近平日前在上海考察調研期間，提及中共的民主是一種「全過程的民主」。但習的相關講話，遭到王滬寧所掌控的黨媒封殺。親北京港媒均對此感到不解，並質疑背後是否另有玄機。
根據中共黨媒披露的及時訊息，2日下午，習近平曾造訪長寧區虹橋街道古北市民中心，在考察社區治理和服務情況時，面對不少外籍居民，習稱，「我們走的是一條中國特色社會主義政治發展道路，人民民主是一種全過程的民主……」。
新華社發表3日晚發表長達3300多字的通稿中，披露了習近平在上海考察的行程以及「最高指示」。但「過濾」掉了習近平有關「全過程民主」的這段講話，央視等官媒也都使用了同樣缺失重要話語的習講話。
港媒《香港01》說，令人不解的是，在新華社長達3,300多字的通稿中，習近平一段重要講話內容被輕易「忽略」掉了， 報導對此感到不解並質疑是否背後另有玄機。
報導說，習近平的這段話意有所指。在剛剛結束的中共十九屆四中全會上，中共提出了所謂的中國特色社會主義制度，並將所謂「發展社會主義民主政治」列入其13個制度優勢之一。
報導表示，習在上台後，極力樹立中共的所謂理論自信，即意識形態自信。習這次在上海試圖解構「民主」是「全過程民主」。這本身最能體現習這次親自到上海傳達四中精神的講話，卻沒出現在新華社通稿中，不知是否另有玄機。

中共所宣稱的民主是專政代稱

事實上，中共所宣稱的民主，與普世認為的民主不同，中共的民主叫「人民民主專政」也就是專制和專政的代稱。
剛結束不久的中共四中全會公報中，再次強調必須堅持黨領導一切，公報還繼續把不搭界的馬列毛思想、鄧理論、三個代表、科學發展觀、習思想共同作為指導思想。在美化中共的歷史和成就的同時，突出強調了中共國家制度和國家治理體系上的所謂優勢等。
對此，大紀元評論員周曉輝說，全會公報的內容對外傳遞的信號就是中共將繼續走「死路」，繼續堅持中共的一黨專政，絕不給中國人自由和民主，而這背後折射的就是中共對失去政權的恐懼。
因為一旦採用西方式民主選舉，讓人民自由地組黨，選擇自己中意的領導人，中共和其領導人將毫無疑問地被拋棄。一旦這樣的情形發生，中共既得利益集團的利益誰來保障？
所以，不是什麼中國民眾不適合民主的形式，而是中共這個自私自利的集團害怕民主的到來，害怕自由帶來的衝擊，因此才絕不走西方民主的道路。四中全會公報再次強化了這一點。
公報還繼續痴人說夢，夢想著在中共成立一百年時的所謂成效，問題是中共靠什麼走到其成立一百年時呢？一個早已失去民心，以禍害人民為宗旨，為利益集團服務的政權，人民還能忍多久呢？世界還能忍多久呢？
時評人士陳破空說，現任常委王滬寧和中宣部對「中國之治」做了很多含蓄解釋，而王滬寧的主張就是決不能讓中國出現民主化運動或要求。

王滬寧多次封殺習近平講話

而王滬寧所掌控的黨媒封殺習近平的講話也早已見怪不怪。
6月7日，習近平訪問俄羅斯期間，正值美中貿易戰升級及中共宣傳口大舉批美之時，習在演講中，卻罕見的表示，美國總統川普是「我的朋友」，雙方都不願看到中美完全割裂。但習的這番講話遭王滬寧所掌控的黨媒封殺。
新華社6月8日刊發習近平上述論壇全會上的致詞，以及習與主持人互動交流的報導中，均沒有提及習有關中美貿易戰等講話。由王滬寧所掌控的官媒，將習近平的重要講話過濾掉，外界認為背後原因不同尋常。
去年9月習近平在黑龍江省考察時，重提「自力更生」的口號，也遭官媒刪除；去年10月，香港武俠小說家金庸舉行葬禮，習近平等中共高層給金庸送了花圈，官媒也沒報導。主管宣傳的王滬寧的用意一度引發輿論猜測。
對此，熟悉中共體制的人士分析說，中共宣傳控制，在中央頂層，由主管宣傳的政治局常委把持，出於政權維穩需要，這些刪改屬正常，但也有可能牽涉權斗關係，比如，前任江派常委劉雲山，過往不時被爆藉此封殺習近平言論，甚至搞「高級黑」。

王滬寧被視為中共的大脑，有中共三朝「帝師」之稱，以筆桿子身分，在十九大躍升常委，成為習近平第二個任期內，主管意識形態的最高官員。
美媒披露，王滬寧未「入常」時，就對涉及習近平的宣傳有特別權限。王不但為習策劃了理論口號，作為習的隨行必備人員，他還可以管制習的照片在官媒的發布。新華社等官媒發布習的照片，都需要先經過王的認可。
中美貿易戰開打之初，中共內部矛盾激化，正是捧習緊急降溫之時。中南海知情者對美媒爆料，針對不斷加劇的內憂外患，王滬寧親自下令，嚴禁所有負面報導和評論發生，以確保習近平的形象「毫髮無傷」。
不過，事實證明，王滬寧所為產生的效果卻適得其反。目前中共高層實施的所有舉措，幾乎都遭到國際社會詬病及中國民間的抨擊，而王滬寧意識形態叫囂，也讓世界更孤立中國，理更讓習近平國際形象一落千丈。
有評論人士說，內外交困下，習近平是否會因難以承受越來越惡化的形勢，進而進行權力再洗牌，最終產生徹底棄絕共產黨意識形態的大破大立局面，值得關注。

Xi Jinping’s important speech was blocked by Wang Huning.

04 Nov 2019, 08:16

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] During Xi Jinping’s investigation and study in Shanghai, he mentioned that the CCP’s democracy is a “global process of democracy”. However, Xi’s related speech was blocked by the party media controlled by Wang Huning. Pro-Beijing-Hong Kong media are puzzled by this and question whether there is another mystery behind it.
According to the timely information disclosed by the Chinese Communist Party media, on the afternoon of the 2nd, Xi Jinping visited the Gubei Civic Center in Hongqiao Street, Changning District. When interviewing the community governance and services, he faced many foreign residents and said, ""We are taking a trip. The path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, people's democracy is a whole process of democracy..."".
The Xinhua News Agency published a draft of more than 3,300 words published on the evening of the 3rd, revealing Xi Jinping’s itinerary in Shanghai and the “highest instructions”. However, ""filtering"" Xi Jinping's speech on ""full-process democracy"", CCTV and other official media also used the same speech that lacked important discourse.
Hong Kong media ""Hong Kong 01"" said that it is puzzling that in the 3,300-word manuscript of Xinhua News Agency, Xi Jinping's important speech was easily ""ignored"". The report was puzzled and questioned whether it was behind Another mystery.
The report said that Xi Jinping’s words meant something. At the just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, the CCP proposed the so-called socialist system with Chinese characteristics and included the so-called ""development of socialist democratic politics"" as one of its 13 institutional advantages.
The report said that after Xi came to power, he tried to establish the so-called theoretical self-confidence of the CCP, that is, ideology confidence. This time, Xi’s attempt to deconstruct “democracy” in Shanghai is “the whole process of democracy”. This in itself is the best expression of the speech that I personally went to Shanghai to convey the spirit of the Four Schools, but it did not appear in the Xinhua News Agency. I wonder if there is another mystery.

The CCP’s declared democracy is the dictatorship of the dictatorship.

In fact, the CCP’s declared democracy is different from the universally regarded democracy. The CCP’s democracy is called the “People’s Democratic Dictatorship”, which is the name of authoritarianism and dictatorship.
In the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, which was just concluded, it was once again emphasized that it is necessary to uphold the party’s leadership. The communique also continues to use the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, Deng’s theory, the three representatives, the scientific development concept, and the habit of thinking that do not meet the border. While beautifying the history and achievements of the CCP, it highlights the so-called advantages of the CCP's national system and national governance system.
In this regard, Epoch Times commentator Zhou Xiaohui said that the message of the contents of the plenary communiqué is that the CCP will continue to follow the ""dead road"" and continue to adhere to the CCP's one-party dictatorship, and will never give Chinese freedom and democracy. The CCP’s fear of losing power.
Because once the Western-style democratic elections are adopted, the people are free to form a party and choose their own favorite leaders, the CCP and its leaders will undoubtedly be abandoned. Once such a situation occurs, who will protect the interests of the vested interests of the CCP?
Therefore, it is not that the Chinese people are not suitable for the form of democracy, but that the self-interested group of the CCP is afraid of the arrival of democracy and fears of the impact of freedom, so it will never follow the path of Western democracy. The Fourth Plenary Session of the General Assembly once again strengthened this point.
The communique continues to be a dream, dreaming of the so-called effect in the 100 years since the founding of the CCP. The question is, what is the CCP's dependence on when it was founded 100 years ago? How long can the people endure a political power that has long lost the hearts of the people and serves the interests of the people? How long can the world endure?
Commentator Chen Broken said that the current Standing Committee member Wang Huning and the Central Propaganda Department have made a lot of implicit explanations for ""the rule of China"", and Wang Huning's claim is that China must not be allowed to democratize the movement or demand.

Wang Huning repeatedly blocked Xi Jinping's speech

The speech of the party media controlled by Wang Huning, Xi Jinping, has long been eccentric.
On June 7th, during Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia, when the US-China trade war escalated and the CCP’s propaganda was heavily publicized, in the speech, it was rare to say that US President Trump was “my friend” and both sides I don't want to see China and the United States completely separated. However, Xi’s speech was blocked by the party media controlled by Wang Huning.
Xinhua News Agency published on June 8th Xi Jinping's speech at the above-mentioned forum plenary, as well as the interviews with Xi and the host, did not mention the relevant Sino-US trade war and other speeches. The official media controlled by Wang Huning filtered the important speech of Xi Jinping. The outside world believes that the reasons behind it are unusual.
When Xi Jinping visited Heilongjiang Province in September last year, he re-raised the slogan of ""self-reliance"" and was also removed by the official media. In October last year, Hong Kong martial arts novelist Jin Yong held a funeral. Xi Jinping’s high-ranking CCP sent a wreath to Jin Yong, and the official media did not. Report. The intention of Wang Huning, who was in charge of publicity, once triggered speculation in public opinion.
In this regard, people familiar with the CCP system analyzed that the propaganda control of the CCP is at the top level of the central government and is controlled by the Politburo Standing Committee in charge of propaganda. For the sake of political stability, these deletions are normal, but they may also involve power relations. For example, the predecessor Liu Yunshan, a member of the Standing Committee of Jiang Pai, has been exploding from time to time to block Xi Jinping’s remarks and even engage in ""advanced black.""

Wang Huning is regarded as the brain of the CCP. He is known as the ""Division of the Emperor"" in the Three Dynasties of the Chinese Communist Party. He was a pen member and became the highest official in charge of ideology during the second term of Xi Jinping.
The US media disclosed that when Wang Huning did not ""go into the regular"", he had special authority over the promotion involving Xi Jinping. Wang not only planned the theoretical slogan for Xi, but also as a necessary person to accompany Xi, he can also control the release of the photo in the official media. Xinhua News Agency and other official media release photos, all need to be approved by the king.
At the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the internal contradictions of the CCP intensified, which was the time when the emergency was cooled. Informed people in Zhongnanhai broke the news against the US media. In response to the growing internal and external problems, Wang Huning personally ordered that all negative reports and comments should be strictly prohibited to ensure that Xi Jinping’s image was “unscathed”.
However, it turns out that the effect produced by Wang Huning is counterproductive. At present, all the measures implemented by the CCP's top management have been criticized by the international community and the Chinese people. The ideology of Wang Huning has also made the world more isolated, and the international image of Xi Jinping has plummeted.
Some commentators said that after internal and external diplomacy, whether Xi Jinping will be able to withstand the worsening situation and then re-shuffle power, eventually resulting in a complete renunciation of the Communist Party's ideology, is worthy of attention.
