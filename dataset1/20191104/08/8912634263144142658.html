      <p>KARBALA, Iraq: Three protesters were shot dead overnight during a demonstration outside the Iranian consulate in Iraq’s holy city of Karbala, the head of the forensics department there told AFP on Monday.</p>
      <p>Another five were killed on Monday in Baghdad when security forces opened fire on demonstrators.   <br/>Overnight, security forces in Karbala fired live ammunition to disperse protesters trying to scale the walls of the consulate in the southern city and torch it.<br/>AFP correspondents witnessed protesters left motionless after suffering gunshot wounds, and the forensic medicine department later confirmed three people died.<br/>More than 250 people have lost their lives since anti-government rallies broke out in Iraq on October 1, but officials have stopped providing casualty numbers.<br/>In Karbala late Sunday, protesters hung Iraqi flags on the concrete blocks surrounding the imposing Iranian consulate and spray-painted “Karbala is free, Iran out, out!” on them.<br/>Others threw rocks or shot fireworks over the walls into the consulate, then set fire to tires at the gates of the building as police officers looked on.</p>

      <p>As the crowds grew, heavy gunfire and volleys of tear gas rang out.<br/>“They’re not firing up in the air. They intend to kill, not disperse,” said one young protester wearing a medical mask to protect himself from the tear gas.<br/>“They’re protecting the Iranian embassy while all we want is a country. Why are they killing their own countrymen for another country?“<br/>Iraq has close but complicated ties with its eastern neighbor Iran, with whom it fought a deadly war in the 1980s but which now has significant political and economic sway in Iraq.<br/>Every year, millions of Iranian pilgrims travel to the holy city of Karbala, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Baghdad, to visit the golden-domed mausoleum of Hussein, the prophet Mohammad’s grandson.<br/>But many Iraqis protesting over the past month accuse Iran of being the primary sponsor of the corrupt, inefficient system they want to overthrow.<br/>Tehran, meanwhile, has sought to clamp down the protests next door, with sources reporting top commander Qassem Soleimani making several visits to “advise” Iraqi authorities on coping with the rallies.<br/>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also slammed protests in Iraq and Lebanon as conspiracies by the US and others.</p>
