      <h1>Unai Emery slammed for "poor leadership" after starting Mesut Ozil in Arsenal's Wolves draw</h1>
      <h2>Ozil was handed his first Premier League start for Arsenal since the draw with Watford in the middle of September</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:32:15+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Tony Cascarino has accused Unai Emery of "poor leadership" for starting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mesut-ozil">Mesut Ozil</a> for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Ozil made his first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> appearance since the middle of September as he was named in the starting XI for the draw with Wolves on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The start came after he impressed in the midweek 5-5 thriller with Liverpool in the Carabao Cup, which the Gunners eventually lost on penalties.</p>
      <p>But while the decision to put him into the team appeased fans, former Chelsea and Aston Villa midfielder Cascarino believes the selection is only showing weakness.</p>
      <p>He believes that Emery is bowing down to fan pressure, as opposed to standing behind what he believes it right.</p>

      <p>"Unai Emery's decision to start Mesut Ozil against Wolves smacked of poor leadership," Cascarino wrote in <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/unai-emerys-flawed-attempt-to-keep-arsenal-supporters-onside-3jmc8pkbr">The Times.</a></p>
      <p>"If the Arsenal manager genuinely believed Ozil was the man to lift his faltering team, he would have used him more than twice in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>"Instead, his selection seemed motivated by a desire to appease the Arsenal fans. If Emery is to turn things around at the Emirates, he needs to do more than simply pick a fan favourite."</p>
      <p>Emery is still fighting for his job after Arsenal let a lead slip for the third game in a row.</p>

      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's opening goal was cancelled out by Raul Jimenez in the latter stages of the match.</p>
      <p>As revealed by Mirror Football, Emery has been given a month to save his job.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are determined to try and give Emery every chance to turn things around and have denied reports suggesting their Head of Football Raul Sanllehi has met with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Arsenal could slip nine points behind the top four if they lose at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> next Saturday and there is a growing fear that the club could act if they are in serious danger of missing out by Christmas.</p>
