      <p>Los Angeles - It was the one they all wanted - the black leather jacket and high-waisted skin-tight pants worn by Olivia Newton-John in the finale of "Grease" electrified a Beverly Hills auction, selling for $405 700 (R6 023 833).</p>
      <p>Now part of Hollywood history, the iconic musical comedy starring Newton-John and John Travolta still arouses passions more than 40 years after it first appeared in movie theatres.</p>
      <p>Newton-John donned the outfit to sing <i>You're the One that I Want</i> with Travolta, her transformation into a sexy greaser girl complete.</p>
      <p>The final price paid Saturday night was twice the pre-sale estimate, according to Julien's Auctions.</p>
      <p>Released in 1978, the most successful movie musical ever tells the high school love story of Sandy (Newton-John) and Danny (Travolta), set in the 1950s.</p>

      <p>Part of the proceeds from the sale of items from the actress' collection will go to fund the Olivia Newton-John centre for cancer research. </p>
