      <p>NEW DELHI: A documentary on Real Kashmir FC has bagged the prestigious British Academy of Film and Television Awards (BAFTA) Scotland Awards 2019 at a glittering ceremony in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>
      <p>The documentary narrates the journey of former Rangers ace David Robertson as the coach of Real Kashmir FC, which in its first season finished third in the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/I-League">I-League</a>, which is currently India's second tier football league.</p>
      <p>The hour-long film, which was aired by BBC Scotland earlier this year, won in the 'Single Documentary' category.</p>
      <p>"It feels amazing to have received this award at one of the biggest platforms in the world, BAFTA," said Sandeep Chattoo, co-founder of Real Kashmir FC.</p>
      <p>"Our dream, which started as a small team of Kashmiri Youth, playing football as a hobby, soon became one of the biggest and the most successful dream runs by any team.</p>
      <p>"This award is a tribute to each and every person who has contributed to making this club what it is today. I thank David for his selfless effort in keeping the team together and would also like to thank Greg Clarke for bringing out the story beautifully on screen," he added.</p>
      <p>The director of the show, Clark was also nominated in the 'Director - Factual' category but he missed out of the award to Matt Pinder, who was adjudged winner for his film 'Murder Case'.</p>
      <p>Real Kashmir had a fairytale journey in their debut I-League season in 2017-18 as the team scripted some memorable wins against top sides including East Bengal and Mohun Bagan as they finished with 36 points from 19 games.</p>
