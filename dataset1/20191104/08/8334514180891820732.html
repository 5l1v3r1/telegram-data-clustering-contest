      <p>SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in on Monday suggested high-level talks to resolve a deepening political and trade row with Japan during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Moon’s spokeswoman said.</p>

      <p>The two leaders held an 11-minute discussion on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok, the spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The meeting comes as relations have plunged to their lowest in decades after South Korea’s top court last year ordered Japanese firms to compensate some wartime forced laborers.</p>
      <p>“Both leaders reaffirmed the principle that bilateral issues should be resolved through dialogue,” Ko said, referring to working-level talks between the countries’ foreign ministries.</p>
      <p>“President Moon offered higher-level talks if necessary, and Prime Minister Abe suggested seeking a resolution through all available means.”</p>
      <p>The two leaders agreed that their ties were important and the dispute should be settled through dialogue, Japan’s NHK broadcaster reported.</p>
      <p>Abe also expressed condolences over the death of Moon’s mother last week, according to NHK.</p>
      <p>As the feud spilled over into trade and security issues, Moon and Abe have not held a summit for more than a year, though they shook hands at a Group of 20 meeting in Japan in June.</p>
      <p>Moon sent Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to Tokyo last month for Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement ceremony with a personal letter calling for efforts to mend ties.</p>
      <p>But there has been little sign of progress. Abe reiterated to Moon that the issue of wartime forced labor was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations following Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule, NHK said.</p>
      <p>While wartime bitterness divides the neighbors, they are both U.S. allies and face threats from North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.</p>
      <p>South Korea has been urging Japan to lift trade measures it imposed this year, as ties deteriorated.</p>
      <p>If Japan does so, South Korea says it could revoke a decision to end a pact on the sharing of military intelligence. The agreement expires later this month.</p>
      <p>South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo told a parliamentary session the deal should be kept “if it helps with our security in any way” but the trade issues also needed to be resolved.</p>
