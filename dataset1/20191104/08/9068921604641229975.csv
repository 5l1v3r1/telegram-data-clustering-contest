Deals Spotlight: 10.5-Inch iPad Air (Cellular, 256GB) Discounted to $679.99, $99 Off and Lowest Ever
04 Nov 2019, 08:09 by Mitchel Broussard
Amazon recently began discounting Apple's Gold 10.5-inch iPad Air with 256GB and cellular capabilities to $679.99, down from $779.00. This represents savings of $99, and is the best price that we've tracked for this model among the major Apple resellers online.



Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. At this time, only the Gold color is available, and many of the other 10.5-inch iPad Air configurations are not up for sale directly by Amazon. Because of the limited scope of the sale, we aren't sure how long it will last, so be sure to head over to Amazon soon to check out the iPad Air if you're interested. Apple updated these models of the iPad Air back in March 2019 with a new 10.5-inch display size, a Touch ID Home button, headphone jack, A12 Bionic processor, Apple Pencil support, and Smart Keyboard compatibility. The model on sale today is the high-end configuration of this line with Wi-Fi and cellular, as well as a 256GB storage capacity.
