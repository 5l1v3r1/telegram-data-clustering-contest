【遊戲】續作登場！《海之號角2：失落王國的騎士》在行動裝置上的聲光享受之作
04 Nov 2019, 06:11 by Mosi
被稱為「薩爾達傳說」致敬之作的《海之號角》，續作的玩法和畫面都大幅進化，用行動裝置就能玩到有如家機水準的大作呢！

遊戲名稱：《海之號角2：失落王國的騎士》（Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm）
遊戲類型：動作冒險
遊戲平臺：Apple Arcade
開發商：Cornfox & Brothers Ltd.
發行商：Cornfox & Brothers Ltd.
遊戲語言：繁體中文、日文、英文
發售日期：2019 年 9 月 19 日

由芬蘭小型獨立製作團隊所打造的 2.5D 動作冒險遊戲《海之號角》，是一款以「薩爾達傳說」為仿效學習對象而製作的作品，曾在 2013 年獲得蘋果「年度最佳遊戲」以及多項業界大獎肯定，之後更在多個遊戲平台上登場；如今製作團隊的經驗與功力更上一層樓，以 UE4 引擎打造了完全 3D 化的續作《海之號角2：失落王國的騎士》，畫面表現令人驚艷！不過本作目前是以 Apple Arcade 獨佔、線上訂閱模式提供給玩家，並不提供買斷的銷售形式，其他平台的玩家也可能還得再等一等囉。

《海之號角2》仍繼承同樣的世界觀，但故事所處的時間點與前作並不同；在傳說中的「阿卡迪亞王國」滅亡多年後，世界短暫迎來了和平，來自小村落的主角，自幼就在騎士「梅菲爾大師」的教養下，成為一名勇氣與武藝兼備的少年。但好景不常，和平的小村落突然遭到暗黑軍的襲擊，以一流騎士為目標的主角，拿起了劍與魔法槍，朝著未知的異境展開冒險之旅。

本作雖然是在 iOS 行動裝置上運作，但畫質可說是媲美家用主機呢！在 UE4 引擎的加持下，畫面表現相當突出，光線的表現更是可圈可點，凡舉自然環境光源、火焰效果、各種不同材質的光反射，甚至是模糊效果帶來的距離感，都讓人難以相信這是行動裝置能呈現的畫面！不僅如此，畫面幀數也很流暢，以筆者手上 2019 年款式的 iPad Air 來執行遊戲，無論是與多名敵人激烈戰鬥或是在有遠景的地圖中，都沒有發生掉幀的情形；不過缺點就是高效能所犧牲的高耗電量，僅遊玩一個多鐘頭就消耗了一半的電力，因此建議玩家還是要稍微注意一下剩餘電量唷。

雖然是以「薩爾達傳說」系列為致敬目標，在不少動作要素中也能看到「薩爾達」的影子，但相比之下，本作因應觸控介面而簡化了不少操作，玩家基本上能在螢幕的左半和右半邊隨意位置控制主角的移動和視角，並利用攻擊鍵、瞄準鍵來分別施展近距離和遠距射擊、魔法攻擊；如果是利用 iOS 裝置的藍牙與 PS4、XboxOne 控制器連線操作的話，不僅操作介面會變得比較乾淨，施展翻滾、劍盾攻防交替時也會比較順手，筆者相當推薦玩家們找個 iOS 裝置支援的控制器來玩。

本作是採線性關卡的形式，玩家會隨著劇情的發展來到不同的區域探險，但由於本作並沒有主動「跳躍」的要素，僅有在某些高度低於肩的地形障礙才會自動越過，因此玩家並無法越過經設計過的地形障礙，然而遊戲中的地圖還算是設計精巧，能探索的細節不算少，玩家可以盡情享受冒險的樂趣！在冒險的過程中，也不時穿插空間解謎和戰鬥，應該能滿足不少同樣是喜歡《薩爾達傳說》系列或是類似解迷冒險遊戲的玩家們。


在面對複數敵人時，自動鎖定系統可能反而會讓玩家手忙腳亂。（圖片來源：遊戲實機截圖）

不過《海之號角2》也並非毫無缺點，最明顯的缺點就是鎖定系統，特別是在持盾面對複數敵人時，隨著距離遠近而自動切換目標的鎖定機能會令不少玩家感到困惑，在觸控介面下遊玩會更顯得手忙腳亂。此外，劇情表現手法上的違和感、像是機器翻譯般詞不達意的人物對白、一定距離外便重生的敵人，多少影響了玩家遊玩時的感受；隊友 AI 無法忠實執行命令也是相當令玩家相當困擾的地方，或許在大部分的戰鬥中憑一己之力擊倒敵人還比較快吧？


這個動作是不是和「林克」很像呢？（圖片來源：遊戲實機截圖）


摸西評語
畫面表現大幅進化的《海之號角2：失落王國的騎士》，在行動裝置上也能享受到有如家用主機遊戲般的聲光效果，遊戲系統大致完備，操作介面不複雜，但推薦還是要以專用手把遊玩才能獲得更好的遊戲體驗。

[Game] sequel to the debut! ""The Sea Horn 2: The Knight of the Lost Kingdom"" enjoys the sound and light on the mobile device
04 Nov 2019, 06:11 by Mosi
Known as the ""Salda Legend"" tribute to the ""The Horn of the Sea"", the sequel's gameplay and pictures have evolved dramatically. With mobile devices, you can play a masterpiece like a home machine!

Game Name: ""The Horn of the Sea 2: The Knight of the Lost Kingdom"" (Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm)
Game Type: Action Adventure
Game platform: Apple Arcade
Developer: Cornfox & Brothers Ltd.
Publisher: Cornfox & Brothers Ltd.
Game language: Traditional Chinese, Japanese, English
Release date: September 19, 2019

The 2.5D action adventure game ""The Horn of the Sea"" created by the Finnish small independent production team is a work created by the legend of ""The Legend of Salda"". It was awarded the ""Best Game of the Year"" in 2013. And a number of industry awards, and later on the game platform; now the production team's experience and skill to a higher level, with the UE4 engine to create a complete 3D sequel ""Sea Horn 2: Lost Kingdom Knight "", the picture performance is amazing! However, this game is currently offered to players in Apple Arcade's exclusive, online subscription model, and does not offer a buyout form. Players on other platforms may have to wait a second.

""Sea Horn 2"" still inherits the same world view, but the time of the story is different from the previous one; after the legendary ""Acadia Kingdom"" has been ruined for many years, the world has ushered in peace for a short time. The protagonist, since childhood, has become a boy with both courage and martial arts under the education of the Cavaliers Master Mayfair. But the good times are not common. The peaceful small village was suddenly attacked by the Dark Army. The protagonist who targeted the first-class knights picked up the sword and the magic gun and embarked on an adventure in an unknown situation.

Although this game is operated on the iOS mobile device, the picture quality can be said to be comparable to the home console! Under the support of the UE4 engine, the picture performance is quite outstanding, and the performance of the light is more remarkable. The natural environment light source, the flame effect, the light reflection of various materials, and even the sense of distance caused by the blur effect make It is hard to believe that this is a picture that mobile devices can present! Not only that, but the number of frames is also very smooth. I use the 2019 iPad Air to execute the game. No matter whether it is fighting with many enemies or in a distant map, there is no frame dropping. The disadvantage is the high power consumption sacrificed by high performance. It only consumes half of the power for more than one hour of play, so it is recommended that players pay a little attention to the remaining power.

Although it is the tribute to the ""Salda Legend"" series, the shadow of ""Salda"" can be seen in many action elements, but in contrast, this operation simplifies many operations in response to the touch interface. Players can basically control the movement and viewing angle of the protagonist in the left and right halves of the screen, and use the attack button and the aiming button to perform close and long range shooting and magic attacks respectively; if it is using the Bluetooth of the iOS device When the PS4 and XboxOne controllers are connected, the operation interface will be cleaner. It will be easier to display the rollover and the sword shield. The author recommends that the player find a controller supported by the iOS device to play.

This game is in the form of a linear level. Players will come to different areas to explore with the development of the story. However, since this game does not have the elements of active “jumping”, only the terrain obstacles below some shoulders will automatically Beyond, so players can't cross the designed terrain obstacles, but the maps in the game are still exquisitely designed, and the details that can be explored are not too few, players can enjoy the adventure! In the process of taking risks, from time to time interspersed with space puzzles and battles, you should be able to satisfy many players who also like the ""Salda Legend"" series or similar adventure games.

However, ""The Horn of the Sea 2"" is not without its drawbacks. The most obvious shortcoming is the locking system. Especially when facing the enemy with a shield, the locking function of automatically switching the target as the distance is far will be confused by many players. Playing in the downstream of the touch interface will be even more fussy. In addition, the sense of disobedience in the performance of the plot, the dialogue of the characters like the machine translation, the enemy who reborn a certain distance, how much affects the player's feelings when playing; the teammate AI can't faithfully execute the command is quite troublesome for the player. Where is it, perhaps in most battles, it is faster to knock down the enemy by itself?


Is this action much like ""Linke""? (Source: Game real machine screenshot)


Touch the comment
The ""Haizhi No. 2: Knight of the Lost Kingdom"", which has undergone a dramatic evolution of the screen, can also enjoy the sound and light effects like a home console game on the mobile device. The game system is almost complete and the operation interface is not complicated, but it is recommended to A dedicated handle can be used to get a better gaming experience.
