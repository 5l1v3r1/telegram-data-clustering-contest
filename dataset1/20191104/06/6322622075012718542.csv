（迪拜4日讯）沙地阿拉伯终于启动可能是全球最大的首次公开募股（IPO），并透露潜在的减税和股息，以吸引投资者。
3年多前，沙地王储Mohammed Salman首次提出这一想法，就在启动上市计划3周后突然推迟。石油巨头SaudiAramco昨日宣布，计划在利雅得证券交易所上市，估计12月将开始交易。
主席Yasir al-Rumayyan在公司总部所在地Dhahran举行的新闻发布会上表示，Aramco的估值将在投资者路演和询价期间敲定。
“我认为现在是最佳时机。与本地投资者相比，国际投资者的比例仍有待确定。如果我们考虑在国际上市，这将是未来的事情。”
总执行长Amin Nasser在会上指出，Aramco将于本周六（9日）推出招股书。
占全球石油产量10%的Aramco，去年的净利为1110亿美元，是全球盈利最多的公司，超过苹果公司（Apple Inc）、谷歌（Google）母公司Alphabet Inc和埃克森美孚（Exxon Mobil Corp）的总和。据知情人士透露，该公司的估值目标是2兆美元（8.34兆令吉），是苹果的两倍多，但沙地如今愿意接受1.6兆至1.8兆美元的估值，以确保IPO成功。
是项IPO是王储Mohammed Salman“2030愿景”（Vision 2030）的关键，旨在彻底改革沙地经济，并结束该国对石油出口的依赖。此次IPO的收益将提高主权财富基金的火力。该投资基金已投资了由Blackstone Group LLP和软银集团（SoftBank Group Corp）管理的基金。沙地全股指数（Tadawul All Share Index）下跌2.4%，Al Rajhi Bank及National Commercial Bank领跌。

银行争抢

全球银行激烈竞争，以在此次交易占一席之位，已有20多家银行获委聘，其中包括花旗集团（Citigroup Inc）、高盛（Goldman Sachs Group Inc）和摩根大通（JP Morgan Chase & Co）。
但是，上市计划并非一帆风顺。王储坚持该公司价值2兆美元，但遭国际投资者的质疑。Aramco原计划在纽约或伦敦上市，但如今已放弃，改为只在利雅得上市。
为了达成交易，Aramco的银行家将需要沙地最富有家族的巨大贡献，他们中许多人可能在2017年的反腐行动中成为目标，当时数十名富有的沙地人被关押在利雅得的Ritz-Carlton酒店。
该公司努力符合一家上市公司的要求，披露更多信息。该公司在120亿美元债券发行前，于4月首次公布年度财务报表。
Aramco昨日在文告中指出，今年首9个月的净收入为680亿美元，销售相关营业额和收入达2440亿美元。该公司预计，明年的资本开销为350亿至400亿美元，2021年则提高到400亿至450亿美元。
该公司与政府同意从1月1日起，修改石油与凝析油的开采税。当布兰特原油低于每桶70美元时，开采税从20%降至15%，若介于70至100美元，则从40%提高至45%，以及当高于100美元，由50%增至80%。
为了提振投资者的兴趣，Aramco表示，将从明年开始对国内下游业务缴纳20%的税率，相比目前的50至80%，前提是该公司在2024年之前将该业务合并为一家独立的独资子公司。
凝析油生产的开采税豁免则将延长10年，原先到2023年初到期。
Aramco董事部证实，除了潜在的特别股息外，公司明年还将派发750亿美元的股息。该公司已考虑提高至800亿美元。1.8兆美元意味着周息率为4.4%，在低利率环境是相当体面的，但仍低于埃克森美孚股东目前获得的5%。

周息率

· 蚬壳 ~6.4%
· 埃克森美孚 ~5%
· Aramco（预估） 3.75%
Aramco在文告中指出，如果散户投资者从公司上市的第一个交易日起，连续不间断地持有公司股票180天，他们将有资格每10股获分配1股。
今年9月，Aramco的原油加工厂遭遇袭击，导致一半的产量受到影响，投资者必须权衡将地缘政治风险上升考虑在内。该公司表示很快恢复了产量，没有影响任何客户订单，但这一事件突显该公司易受地区军事威胁的影响。 - 彭博社

(Dubai, 4th) Saudi Arabia has finally launched the world's largest initial public offering (IPO) and revealed potential tax cuts and dividends to attract investors.
More than three years ago, the king of the sand, Mohammed Salman, first proposed this idea, and it was suddenly postponed three weeks after the launch of the listing plan. Oil giant SaudiAramco announced yesterday that it plans to list on the Riyadh stock exchange and is expected to start trading in December.
Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said at a press conference held in Dhahran, where the company's headquarters is located, that Aramco's valuation will be finalized during investor roadshows and inquiries.
“I think it is the best time now. Compared with local investors, the proportion of international investors remains to be determined. If we consider listing on the international market, this will be the future.”
Chief Executive Amin Nasser pointed out at the meeting that Aramco will launch a prospectus this Saturday (9th).
Aramco, which accounts for 10% of global oil production, had a net profit of $111 billion last year and is the most profitable company in the world, surpassing Apple Inc., Google parent company Alphabet Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp. Sum. According to people familiar with the matter, the company's valuation target is 2 trillion US dollars (8.34 trillion), more than twice that of Apple, but the sand is now willing to accept a valuation of 1.6 trillion to 1.8 trillion dollars to ensure the success of the IPO.
The IPO is the key to Crown Prince Mohammed Salman's ""Vision 2030"" (Vision 2030), which aims to revolutionize the sand economy and end the country's dependence on oil exports. The income of this IPO will increase the firepower of sovereign wealth funds. The investment fund has invested in funds managed by Blackstone Group LLP and SoftBank Group Corp. The Tadawul All Share Index fell 2.4%, led by Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank.

Bank competition

Global banks are fiercely competing, and in this transaction, more than 20 banks have been appointed, including Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JP Morgan Chase & Co. ).
However, the listing plan is not always smooth. The Crown Prince insisted that the company valued $2 trillion but was questioned by international investors. Aramco was originally planned to be listed in New York or London, but has now given up and is only listed in Riyadh.
In order to close the deal, Aramco's bankers will need the richest contributions of the richest families in the sand, many of whom may be targeted in the 2017 anti-corruption campaign, when dozens of wealthy sand people were detained in Ritz-Riyadh. Carlton hotel.
The company strives to comply with the requirements of a public company and disclose more information. The company first published its annual financial statements in April before the issuance of $12 billion in bonds.
Aramco pointed out in a statement yesterday that net income for the first nine months of this year was $68 billion, and sales-related revenues and revenues reached $244 billion. The company expects capital spending next year to be between $35 billion and $40 billion, and in 2021 it will rise to $40 billion to $45 billion.
The company and the government agreed to revise the mining tax on oil and condensate from January 1. When Brent crude oil is below $70 a barrel, the mining tax is reduced from 20% to 15%, from $70 to $100, from 40% to 45%, and when it is above $100, by 50% Increased to 80%.
In order to boost investor interest, Aramco said it will pay a 20% tax rate on domestic downstream operations starting next year, compared to the current 50 to 80%, provided that the company merges the business into an independent business by 2024. A wholly-owned subsidiary.
The mining tax exemption for condensate production will be extended for 10 years, originally due to expire in early 2023.
Aramco's Board of Directors confirmed that in addition to the potential special dividend, the company will also pay a dividend of $75 billion next year. The company has considered raising it to $80 billion. The $1.8 trillion means a weekly interest rate of 4.4%, which is quite decent in a low interest rate environment, but still below the current 5% of Exxon Mobil shareholders.

Weekly interest rate

· Clam shell ~6.4%
· ExxonMobil ~5%
· Aramco (estimated) 3.75%
Aramco pointed out in the statement that if the retail investors hold the company's stock for 180 days from the first trading day of the company's listing, they will be eligible to be allocated 1 share for every 10 shares.
In September, Aramco's crude oil processing plant was attacked, causing half of its production to be affected. Investors must weigh the rise in geopolitical risk. The company said it quickly resumed production without affecting any customer orders, but the incident highlighted the company's vulnerability to regional military threats. - Bloomberg
