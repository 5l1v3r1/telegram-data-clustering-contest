      <p>‌Apple TV‌+ officially launched on November 1, and anyone who purchased an iPhone, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, ‌‌Apple TV‌‌, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/">iPod touch</a>, or Mac after September 10 can get a year's subscription to it for free. <br/><br/>The trial is supposed to be offered to users who launch the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app on a qualifying Apple device. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/not-seeing-apple-tv-1-year-free-trial/">reports on Friday</a> suggested that many customers aren't seeing any sign of the trial they're entitled to. <br/><br/>Some people experiencing trouble activating the trial on an Apple mobile device have reportedly had better luck visiting <a href="https://tv.apple.com/">https://tv.apple.com</a> on a desktop web browser and logging in using their Apple ID credentials. <br/><br/>But if that doesn't work for you, contact <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/">Apple support</a>. According to users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/dr71b5/psa_if_you_have_not_been_able_to_redeem_the_apple/">Reddit</a>, they are able to generate a unique 1-year offer code that can be redeemed in the iTunes/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/">App Store</a>. <br/><br/>To facilitate the resolution, customers should have to hand their MacOS/iOS version, proof of purchase and date of purchase, and the name of the store where they bought their qualifying Apple product. <br/><br/>The <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Lm17u88.jpg">code redemption confirmation</a> is said to show ‌Apple TV‌+ as "free for 1-one week," but actually states lower down that the paid subscription doesn't start until November 2020.</p>
