代表國民黨參與2020總統大選的高雄市長韓國瑜昨（3日）沒有公開行程，由夫人李佳芬前進台中舉辦「佳芬講堂」代夫出征，展現夫人魅力，席間除了喊出「學貸免息若學生繳不出就由政府吞了」，言論引發熱議外，也談到韓國瑜曾喊口號「征服宇宙」，李佳芬表示「21世紀了，征服宇宙絕對不是在開玩笑」「認為宇宙無法征服的人那真是個草包」。
韓國瑜參選時曾喊出「立足台灣、胸懷大陸、放眼世界、征服宇宙」的口號，這也是他與李佳芬創辦的維多利亞雙語學校校訓。李佳芬表示校訓也常常被別人拿來說笑，但是她以小說《時光旅人》做例子，表示小說內容在談時空穿越，作者在寫和發表的時候都非常緊張，後來才發現其實全世界已經有很多人在談時空穿越了。
李佳芬表示，如果20世紀是太空旅行的世紀，21世紀就是時空穿越的世紀，所以「征服宇宙一點都不是開玩笑的，如果你沒有這樣的觀念，如果你沒有接觸，那就會覺得是玩笑，但如果你接觸，你就會發現，你還笑他的話…挺危險的！」
