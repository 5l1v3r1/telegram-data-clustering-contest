【影評】《陽光普照》　「家」的冰與火之歌
04 Nov 2019, 06:12 by 黃以曦
既冷又暖，情感深度刻劃之作。
鍾孟宏相較於過往的邊緣疏離，以「家庭」為母題的本片換以較沉穩明朗氣質架構世界，取名「陽光普照」，充滿洞察與深意，並非乍看的溫情。


陽光普照《A Sun》

故事描述一個家庭，小兒子阿和進了少年監獄，大兒子阿豪是資優生，父親明顯偏愛長子。母親既拿丈夫沒辦法，婚姻也在降溫。此刻又出現了阿和的懷孕女友，而品學兼優的阿豪懷著祕密，阿和的過往友人菜頭也等著他出獄要追討當年發生的事…。
電影長達155分鐘，除有數處冗餘與重複的段落，設定上且不夠俐落立體。例如阿豪的資優生內心黑洞段落是個有意思的題目，但並未深究、也沒做出之於阿和的對照。
故事講「家」，涵蓋了數個明與暗喻的家庭，企圖心十足；但情感主軸，也是作者拿手的，仍在於男性情誼。儘管柯淑勤、尹馨、温貞菱、吳岱凌表演稱職，但電影中母女、夫妻、婆媳、情侶等牽涉到女性角色的戲偏弱。
但在父子、親生兄弟、道上兄弟的情感，以及人對己身生存的煩躁與焦慮，《陽光普照》展現了銳利冷峻，卻同時也滿載了幾乎是溫柔的理解，是令人倒抽一口氣的心酸與痛，非常動人。
巫建和與劉冠廷不辜負富有層次的角色，有細緻而絕不俗膩的優秀表演；厲害的更是陳以文，將一個父親的「表裡不一」、他的壓抑、失落和悲痛，詮釋得極好。
《陽光普照》延續了鍾孟宏的創作關注，終究關於人的孤獨，放在家庭的故事背景裡，促成另份感染力，因為「家」正是人無法放棄各自完整性、卻不得不被綁在一起的地方。這是部每個人都會感動或感慨的電影。

[Shadow Review] ""Sunshine"" ""Home"" Ice and Fire Song
04 Nov 2019, 06:12 by Huang Yizhen
It is cold and warm, and the emotions are deeply scribed.
Compared with the past edge of the border, Zhong Menghong is replaced by a more stable and succinct temperamental world. The name is ""sunshine"", full of insight and deep meaning, not a warm-hearted look.


Sunshine ""A Sun""

The story describes a family, the youngest son Ah He entered the juvenile prison, the eldest son Ahao is a gifted student, and his father obviously favors the eldest son. The mother has no way to take her husband, and the marriage is also cooling down. At this moment, Ah He’s pregnant girlfriend appeared again, and Ahao, who has a good academic ability, has a secret. Ah’s past friends’ dishes are waiting for him to be released from prison to recover what happened in the past...
The movie lasted 155 minutes, except for a few redundant and repeated paragraphs, which were set up and not enough to fall stereo. For example, Ah Hao’s gifted students’ inner black hole passage is an interesting topic, but it has not been studied in depth and has not been made in the comparison of Ah He.
The story tells the story of ""home"", which covers several families of Ming and Metaphor. It is full of emotions; but the main axis of emotion is also the author's master, still in male friendship. Although Ke Shuqin, Yin Xin, Wen Yuling, and Wu Yuling performed well, the mother and daughter, husband and wife, couples, and other couples involved in the film were weak.
But in the emotions of father and son, biological brothers, brothers on the Tao, and the irritability and anxiety of people living on their own, ""Sunshine"" shows sharp and cold, but at the same time it is also full of almost gentle understanding, it is a breathtaking breath. The sadness and pain are very moving.
Wu Jianhe and Liu Guanting lived up to a rich and hierarchical role, with meticulous and unremarkable performances; the most powerful is Chen Yiwen, who interprets a father’s ""inconsistent"", his repression, loss and grief. Very good.
""Sunshine"" continues the attention of Zhong Menghong's creation. After all, the loneliness of people is placed in the background of the family's story, which promotes another appeal. Because ""home"" is the person who can't give up their integrity, but has to be tied to it. The place together. This is a movie that everyone will touch or feel.
