由文化部影視及流行音樂產業局主辦的第十屆金音創作獎及亞洲音樂大賞活動（Asia Rolling Music Festival），邀請台灣及亞洲音樂創作人在台北及高雄共6間Live house舉行現場演出及講座。
國際論壇以5個專題企劃，邀請業界設計師、MV導演、樂手、製作人、海外演出經紀、企劃宣傳、品牌經營者等，分享音樂故事與實務經驗，並邀請國內外策展人、經紀人、從業人員等，透過現場媒合交流，協助新興樂團與亞洲各國接軌，拓展海外市場。
只是，今年特別邀請五月天的瑪莎擔任評審團主席如今生變，影視局局長徐宜君表示，「現已經完成國際評審團組成、入圍名單評審及入圍記者會等事宜，因後續尚有連續多日現場演出獎之現場評審及相關決審，瑪莎因工作忙碌將無法參與。」
