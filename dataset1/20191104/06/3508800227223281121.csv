為何警方澄清不了傳聞？
04 Nov 2019, 06:51 by 讀者投書


我們想讓你知道的是在可見的未來十年，以至二十年，警隊的聲望會降至冰點，市民普偏對警隊懷疑不信任及懷有敵意，敢問警隊到時如何執法？



文：莫梓俊
工作關係，警方過去多月的四點鐘記者會筆者幾乎無一遺漏全部觀看，包括那要命的答問環節。多個月來看著警方單調地不斷重覆又重覆去澄清831事件無打死人、新屋嶺內沒有虐待被捕人、無警察性侵強女被告、無起用內地公安執法、連帶形形式式的網上傳聞，但觀乎網上反應，大量市民連一刻鐘都無打算相信警方的講法，所有的傳聞越傳越熱。
看著傳媒朋友日復日就住傳聞的種種細節去提問，警方又一而再地用虛無的答案答覆，始終沒有人問一條有些主觀但卻重要的問題：「多個月來警方不斷去就傳聞澄清，但傳聞卻越傳越熱，警方有否反思過自己的公信力為何如此低下？」
有道說流言殺人，筆者卻認為更多是自作孽。每次澄清流言也許涉及以證據說話，但去到最後往往都成了信心的問題，形象中肯值得信賴的話，群眾面對流言自然有抗體百毒不侵，甚至自動為你辯解，相反形象低劣不得民心者，人們對你故是百般差疑，到時什麼樣的流言傳聞人人都覺得有可能，那怕你拿出什麼證據，都會被認為是弄虛作假。而不幸地，今日的香港警察正正就是如此，而更不幸的是，香港警察落得如欺境地，全因自己所致，與人無尤。
反修例運動持續多月，戰火由個別特大日子演變成每個週末的持績衝突，由固定地區燒到各區遍地開花。無論原因是香港警方策略失當、警察個人能力問題、高層觀念失舊，從各大媒體鏡頭或者親身接觸，香港警察都作出了極其差劣的示範。隨著防暴警與「速龍」一次又一次的「落區」，可以發現與其發生衝突的對象已由示威者轉為街坊。被稱為香港十八區中最「勇武」的黃大仙區，當日衝突緣起只是幾個居民因小事被捕，引起街坊群起落樓聲援，警員隨後選擇強硬方法應對。
這種模式之後不斷在其他區複制，可以見到警方及前線警員前設地將所有在地區出現的市民和街坊都劃一地定義為潛在的敵人，而在處理與市民的衝突時，懷柔與退讓的選擇成為次要選項或者根本不成選項，結果強硬成為唯一行動方針，卻意外觸動當區居民的鄰舍聯結，鼓勵了更多的居民上街，而當警方面對更強的抵抗就使出了更硬的石頭，情況不斷循環，就結果而言，警方可說是「落一區，輸一區」，尤其許多居民本身都未必支持修例，但都在領教過「警暴」後紛紛「中立轉黃」至「藍轉黃」。正是警方這種敵視一切的態度，令自己在一次又一次的辱罵與指罵街坊、棍打、椒噴、煙熏途人中將民心逐點逐點失去。

美國革命後，曾有人問其中一位開國元勳約翰.阿當斯（John Adams），誰在革命中付出最大功勞？正當大家以為他會將功勞歸於自己，或者華盛頓（George Washington）時，他卻將功勞歸於英皇佐治三世（George III）。原來獨立運動初期，北美大陸仍有不少猶豫不決的中間派與主張與英國講和的溫和派，大家都想事情好好解決，爭取機會與英國講道理，最終一槌定音的是佐治三世宣佈北美人民的行肩是叛亂，隨即派大軍鎮壓。北美人民發現無話可說，大軍又即將殺至家園，結果民心紛紛流向支持革命。
香港警察今日可謂完美扮演了這個奸角的角色，在一種無差別的敵意下，利用催淚彈、警棍、胡椒彈槍、水炮車團結起一班立場相左的市民，一起站在「抵抗警暴」的這面旗幟下，就這個角度而言，稱香港警察是今次運動中團結示威者與保持運動延續性的一大功臣都不為過。
如果將時間撥回至上世紀九十年代前後，那個成龍的《警察故事》大受歡迎、警訊都以之作為主題曲的時間，嘗試告訴大家警察會濫用暴力毆打被捕人、會性侵害女被告、甚至打死人後隱藏真相，你會一笑置之，認為這是個失實的大話，今時今日你聽到這些流言，你就不能這麼肯定。當見到警員一次又次將示威者，甚至是無關的途人打到頭破血流；當警員用最惡劣的態度去面對街上的質疑；當警員隨意衝入私人物業，要求住戶像戰犯般下跪；當警隊用納粹對待猶太人的一套對付香港人；當香港警察表現得更像是一班佔領軍，而非執法者的時候，你會想：「還有什麼不可能？」。
至此，問題已不再是「警察有沒有做過」，而是「市民覺得警察有做過」，懷疑的種子一旦種下，就會在心底裡植根成長，難以根絕。
香港警察的前景是災難性的，每次所謂的拘捕行動，都必然揭露警員的濫捕與無理，每次為了打倒一個敵人，卻制造了一打敵人。他們自視為救火的行為，卻又點起了更大的火頭，即使有天真的拉盡了「勇武」，只是將火炎由大火轉為悶燒，代價卻是讓老一輩重溫了廉政公署成立前的警察為所欲為的光景、成年人對執法者的不信任、青年人作為未來主人翁永遠此仇不共戴天。在可見的未來十年，以至二十年，警隊的聲望會降至冰點，市民普偏對警隊懷疑不信任及懷有敵意，敢問警隊到時如何執法？
因此，下次四點鐘記者會，假如各位「香港警隊大公國」的統領又再問不知道為何運動會持續至今，我誠意建議各位可以嘗試照鏡，相信鏡內的倒影是各位的最佳答案。

Why can't the police clarify the rumors?
04 Nov 2019, 06:51 by readers


What we want you to know is that in the visible 10 years and even 20 years, the reputation of the Police Force will drop to freezing point. The public is generally distrustful of the police team and hostile. How dare to ask the police how to enforce the law?



Text: Mo Yujun
Working relationship, the police have almost missed all the interviews at the four o'clock press conference in the past few months, including the question and answer session. Over the past few months, the police have been monotonously repeating and repeating to clarify that there were no deaths in 831 incidents, no ill-treatment of arrested persons in Xinwuling, no police invaders, no public security enforcement in the Mainland, and joint forms. Online rumors, but watching online reactions, a large number of people have no intention of believing in the police for a quarter of an hour, all the rumors are getting hotter and hotter.
I watched the media friends go to the various details of the rumors day after day to ask questions. The police repeatedly answered with no false answers. No one has ever asked a question that is subjective but important: ""The police have been rumoring for months. Clarification, but the rumors have become more and more hot. Has the police reflected on how low their credibility is?""
There is a saying that rumors kill, but the author thinks that more is self-defeating. Every time the rumors are clarified, it may involve speaking with evidence, but in the end, it often becomes a question of confidence. If the image is trustworthy, the masses will naturally have antibodies against the rumors, and even automatically defend for you. On the contrary, the image is inferior. People of the people, people are so skeptical about you, what kind of rumors are rumored by everyone, and even if you come up with any evidence, you will be considered falsified. Unfortunately, today's Hong Kong police are just like this, and even more unfortunately, the Hong Kong police are as deceived as they are, because they are caused by themselves.
The anti-revision campaign lasted for many months, and the warfare evolved from a single mega-day to a performance conflict every weekend, from the fixed area to the various areas. Regardless of the reasons for the misappropriation of the Hong Kong police, the personal abilities of the police, and the disrespect of high-level attitudes, the Hong Kong police have made extremely poor demonstrations from major media shots or personal contact. With the riot police and the ""Athlon"" again and again ""falling areas"", it can be found that the object of conflict has been turned from a demonstrator to a neighborhood. Known as the most ""brave force"" in the 18th district of Hong Kong, Wong Tai Sin District, the conflict was only a few residents arrested for minor incidents, causing the community to rise and fall, and the police officers chose tough methods.
This model has been continuously replicated in other districts. It can be seen that the police and frontline police officers have defined all the citizens and neighborhoods in the area as potential enemies. When dealing with conflicts with the public, Huairou and The choice of concession became a secondary option or not an option at all. As a result, the toughness became the only course of action, but it unexpectedly touched the neighbors of the district residents, encouraging more residents to go to the streets, and when the police faced stronger resistance, they came out. In the case of harder stones, the situation continues to circulate. As a result, the police can be said to be ""falling into one district and losing one district"". In particular, many residents themselves may not support the amendments, but they have all experienced ""policestorms"". ""Neutral to yellow"" to ""blue to yellow"". It is the police’s hostile attitude that has caused the hearts and minds of the people to be lost point by point in the insults and fingerings, clubs, peppers, and smokers.

After the American Revolution, someone asked one of the founding fathers, John Adams, who paid the most for the revolution. Just when everyone thought he would attribute his credit to himself, or George Washington, he attributed the credit to George III. At the beginning of the independence movement, there were still a lot of hesitant middlemen in the North American continent and moderates who advocated talking with the British. Everyone wanted to solve things well and strive for opportunities to communicate with the United Kingdom. The final decision was that George III announced North America. The people’s shoulders were rebellions, and they immediately sent a large army to suppress them. The people of North America have found nothing to say, and the army is about to kill their homes. As a result, the hearts of the people have flown to support the revolution.
The Hong Kong Police today perfectly played the role of this traitor. Under an indiscriminate hostility, they used tear gas, batons, pepper guns and water cannons to unite a group of people who stood in disagreement and stood together to ""resist the police."" Under this banner, from this perspective, it is no exaggeration to call the Hong Kong police a great contributor to uniting demonstrators and maintaining continuity in this movement.
If the time is set back to the 1990s, the time when Jackie Chan’s ""Police Story"" is popular and the warnings are used as the theme song, try to tell everyone that the police will abuse violence to beat the arrested person and sexually assault the woman. If you accuse the defendant and even kill the person, you will laugh and think that this is a false statement. You can’t be so sure when you hear these rumors today. When the police officers were seen, the demonstrators and even the unrelated passers-by went to the head and blood; when the police officers used the worst attitude to face the doubts on the street; when the police officers rushed into the private property, Residents are required to kneel like war criminals; when the police force treats Jewish people with Nazis against Hong Kong people; when Hong Kong police perform more like an occupation army than a law enforcement officer, you will think: ""What else? may?"".
At this point, the question is no longer ""whether the police have done it or not"" but ""the public feels that the police have done it."" Once the seeds of doubt are planted, they will grow up in the bottom of their hearts and it will be difficult to eradicate.
The prospects of the Hong Kong police are disastrous. Every so-called arrest operation will inevitably expose the police officers to over-the-counter and unreasonable. Every time they defeat an enemy, they create a dozen enemies. They regard themselves as a fire-fighting act, but they have set a bigger fire. Even if they have innocently pulled out the ""brave force"", they only turn the fire from a big fire to a smoldering. The price is to relive the old generation. Before the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the police were eager for the situation, the adult’s distrust of the law enforcers, and the youth as the future master. In the visible next decade and even 20 years, the reputation of the Police Force will drop to freezing point. Members of the public are suspected of distrust and hostility to the police. How can the police force enforce the law?
Therefore, at the next four o'clock press conference, if the ""Hong Kong Police Force Grand Duchy"" commander asks again, I do not know why the Games will continue to this day. I sincerely suggest that you can try to look at the mirror. I believe that the reflection in the mirror is the best answer for you.
