      <p>Strictly star Emma Barton was seen using Makaton sign language to say thank you to her fans as she discovered she had made it through to next week.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old actress looked utterly delighted as she and her pro partner Anton du Beke were confirmed safe during the Sunday results show.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a sparkling royal blue dress, Emma looked shocked as her name was announced before clapping her hands together and mouthing the words ‘thank you’.</p>
      <p>She then used the Makaton sign to send her thanks to viewers who were either non-verbal or hard of hearing.</p>

      <p>Makaton is a sign language programme adapted from British sign language that uses signs and symbols as a means of communicating.</p>
      <p>The language also assists those who are non-verbal to move at their own pace to develop their skills, with the gesture often accompanied by spoken cues.</p>

        <figcaption>The gesture looks similar to a flying kiss but actually begins on the chin rather than the mouth</figcaption>

      <p>Fans immediately took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to thank the Eastenders star for her inclusivity, with one writing: “Lovely to see @EmmaBarton signing ‘Thank you’ again. Raising awareness of Makaton and children who use it to communicate in everyday life. Well done for getting through as well. I thought your dance was beautiful.”</p>
      <p>Emma is not the first celebrity to use Makaton to reach out to fans.</p>
      <p>Over the course of this year’s Strictly, Michelle Visage, Chris Ramsey and Saffron Barker have all been spotted using Makaton gestures including thank you and love.</p>
      <p>The judges have also tried their hand at Makaton, with head judge Shirley Ballas using the sign for ghost during her entrance for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> week.</p>
      <p>According to the official Makaton website, more than 100,000 children and adults in the UK use the Makaton system to aid communication.</p>
