04 Nov 2019, 06:30

PSA: You should a hundred percent be using an overnight sleeping face mask as a part of your p.m. skincare routine. Why, you ask? Well, for one, these “masks”—which are really just souped-up night creams full of active ingredients—are great for targeting specific skin issues like acne, redness, dark spots, and dryness. And because you use them at night when your skin is in repair mode and highly receptive to active ingredients, they’re super effective too. So do your skin a favor and check out this list of the 10 best overnight sleeping face masks below, slather one on before bed, and wake up to clear, glowy skin in the morning.

Courtesy Image

sephora.com $38.00 SHOP NOW
Some overnight sleeping masks are basically just super-thick moisturizers and can feel kinda suffocating on your skin. Not this vitamin-rich jelly sleeping mask though—it is super lightweight and soaks into your skin in seconds without any heavy or sticky residue. I like to keep mine in the fridge for some extra cooling and de-puffing action when I pop it on.
