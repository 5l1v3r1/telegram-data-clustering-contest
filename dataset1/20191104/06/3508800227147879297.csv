回到正常生活？拜託，不要再跟我來這一套
04 Nov 2019, 06:36 by 蕭家怡


我們想讓你知道的是令我更心寒的，是身邊依然有人，會去為已經完全失控的警察去辯解，會自命中立的去為警察的一切行徑去找出合理化的理由，甚至覺得抗爭者不停手，大家就無法回歸平靜，回復「正常」生活。



凌晨時分看新聞，看著高高在上的高層將一宗明明白白的濫權事件說成是誤會，然後生氣得不能入睡；
和澳門的朋友傳訊息，她問我：「今日有甚麼行程？需要食『放題』嗎？」我說：「不知道，現在只要走出街，都有機會中，回答不了。」
之後，另一位香港的朋友傳來訊息，是一大個嬲嬲的符號，我問她發生了甚麼事；她說，「睇完戲，成個商場嘅舖頭關門，然後就被警察舉槍喝住要走。」
稍晚，認識的朋友被捕，替其張羅律師之際，又傳來了記者被拉、區議員被襲的消息，而兇徒施襲後，更露出了笑容……
以上這些，就是我在一個星期日裏所經歷的事，而我也不知由甚麼時候開始，大家早已經要懷著出街就有可能食催淚彈、會被槍指住，甚至被捕的心理準備，因為在這裏，似乎早已沒有甚麼標準和道理可言。

但這已經足夠令人心寒？我覺得不是，因為令我更心寒的，是知道在此時此刻，自己身邊依然有人，會去為已經完全失控的警察去辯解，會自命中立的去為警察的一切行徑去找出合理化的理由，甚至覺得抗爭者不停手，大家就無法回歸平靜，回復「正常」生活。
面對這些朋友，我大概已經失去了所有耐性，也懶得再去說甚麼「沉默的人是幫兇」、「地獄最黑暗之處，留給在有道德危機時保持中立的人」之類的說話，我只知道：
當一個城市裏，警察可以在市民有生命危險時轉身離開，然後三十九分鐘後才出現；當一個城市裏，警察可以認為市民在喬裝市民、出現在自己的社區是「扮嘢」；當一個城市裏，警察可以打著執法者的旗號，無視一切法律、標準，為所欲為時； 這個城市根本不會再有甚麼「正常」。
那些口口聲聲說要回復「正常」的人，拜託，不要再跟我來這一套了，因為那個你眼中的「正常」香港，我們都回不去了。

Back to normal life? Please, don't come with me again.
04 Nov 2019, 06:36 by Xiao Jiayi


What we want you to know is that it makes me more chilling. There are still people around me who will defend the police who have completely lost control. They will pretend to be neutral and find reasonable reasons for the police. They even feel that they are protesters. Without stopping, everyone will not be able to return to calm and return to a ""normal"" life.



Watching the news in the early hours of the morning, watching the high-ranking high-level officials say that a clear-cut abuse of power is a misunderstanding, and then angry can not sleep;
I sent a message to a friend from Macau. She asked me: ""What is the itinerary today? Do you need to eat the ""problem""?"" I said, ""I don't know, now I have to go out of the street and have a chance to answer.""
Afterwards, another Hong Kong friend sent a message, which was a big embarrassing symbol. I asked her what happened. She said, ""When you finish the show, you will become a mall and close the door, then you will be lifted by the police. The gun is going to drink.""
Later, the friends who were known were arrested. On the occasion of Zhang Luo’s lawyer, there was news that the reporter was pulled and the district board members were attacked. After the attack, the culprits showed a smile...
These are the things I have experienced on a Sunday, and I don’t know when it’s time to start. Everyone has to go out of the street and have the possibility to eat tear gas, be pointed by guns, or even be arrested. Because here, it seems that there is no standard and reason.

But is this enough to be chilling? I don't think so, because it makes me more chilling. I know that at this moment, there are still people around me who will go to defend the police who have completely lost control. They will pretend to be neutral and find out the rational reasons for all the police. Even if the protesters do not stop, everyone will not be able to return to calm and return to a ""normal"" life.
In the face of these friends, I probably have lost all patience and I am too lazy to say something like ""silent people are accomplices"", ""the darkest part of hell, and reserved for those who remain neutral in a moral crisis"". ,I only know:
In a city, the police can turn away when the citizens are in danger, and then appear only thirty-nine minutes later. In a city, the police can think that the public is disguised as a citizen and appears in their own community. In a city, the police can use the banner of law enforcement, ignore all laws and standards, and do whatever they want. The city will never have any more ""normal.""
Those who keep saying that they want to return to ""normal"", please, don't come with me again, because the ""normal"" Hong Kong in your eyes, we can't go back.
