中國《26條措施》允台人使館求援　陸委會：證明分化台灣企圖
04 Nov 2019, 06:15 by 吳妍
中國國家主席習近平於年初《告台灣同胞書》40週年致詞時對台灣喊話「一國兩制和平統一」「不承諾放棄使用武力」，今國台辦、國家發展改革委則進一步落實習近平於《告台灣同胞書》40週年上所強調之「保障台灣福祉」精神，推出《26條措施》，允許台資企業在5G、民航、投資上擁有和當地企業同等待遇，且在個人上，台灣人可於中國駐外使館尋求保護和協助，並申請旅行證件。對此，陸委會表示，這是北京當局「一國兩制」的兩面手法，實難拉近兩岸距離。
據《新華社》報導，國台辦等相關部門今推出《關於進一步促進兩岸經濟文化交流合作的若干措施》(簡稱26條措施），包括台資企業在5G、民航、貸款、融資上都和當地企業擁有同等待遇，在個人上，台灣運動員可參加中國全國性體育比賽，可以內援方式參加職業聯賽，在購房、留學上也擁有和當地居民相同資格。
對此陸委會指出，今發布的《26條措施》為去年對台31項措施的延伸，相關內容則不改「名為惠台、實則利中」本質，更夾帶一國兩制的政治操作，也是繼「習五條」之後，北京當局對台實施政軍施壓，威迫我國接受其「一國兩制」主張的「兩面手法」，其「拉打兩手」人盡皆知，也難以拉近兩岸距離。
並指出，北京再推出《26條措施》只是為了掩飾31項措施執行不彰的事實，也反映中國經濟下行壓力及各部門間協調限制，實施成效言過其實，完全禁不起檢驗；更反映了這段期間台灣人拒絕「一國兩制」、不認同中共統戰分化的結果。也強調中共企圖以融台促統政策拉攏台灣，意圖分化台灣內部，更證明其企圖介入影響台灣選舉。陸委會表示，去年政府已持續追蹤評估31項措施，並關注後續中共作為對台影響，提醒國人兩岸制度差異，及赴陸應注意可能風險。

At the beginning of the 40th anniversary of the ""Taiwan Compatriots"" at the beginning of the year, Chinese President Xi Jinping shouted ""Taiwan's peaceful reunification of one country, two systems"" and ""does not promise to renounce the use of force.""

In the spirit of ""protecting Taiwan's well-being"" emphasized on the 40th anniversary of the book, the ""26 Measures"" was introduced to allow Taiwan-funded enterprises to have the same treatment as local enterprises in 5G, civil aviation and investment, and personally, Taiwanese can be in China. The embassy abroad seeks protection and assistance and applies for travel documents. In this regard, the MAC stated that this is a two-way approach of the ""one country, two systems"" of the Beijing authorities. It is difficult to draw closer to the two sides.
According to the ""Xinhua News Agency"" report, the relevant departments of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and Taiwan and other relevant departments have launched ""Several Measures to Further Promote Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation"" (referred to as 26 measures), including Taiwan-funded enterprises in 5G, civil aviation, loans, financing and local Enterprises have the same treatment.

Following the ""Xiwu Articles"", the Beijing authorities exerted pressure on Taiwan's political and military forces to force China to accept the ""two-faced approach"" of its ""one country, two systems"" proposition. It is well known that it is difficult to draw closer to the two sides.
He also pointed out that Beijing's ""26 measures"" was only to cover up the fact that 31 measures were not implemented, and also reflected the downward pressure on China's economy and the coordination restrictions between various departments. The implementation results were overstated and could not be tested. The Taiwanese refused to ""one country, two systems"" and did not agree with the results of the CCP's united front. He also stressed that the CCP’s attempt to promote Taiwan’s policy through the integration of Taiwan and Taiwan is intended to divide Taiwan’s interior and prove its attempt to intervene in the election of Taiwan. The MAC said that last year the government has continuously tracked and evaluated 31 measures, and paid attention to the follow-up of the CCP's influence on Taiwan, reminding the Chinese people of the cross-strait system differences, and paying attention to possible risks.
