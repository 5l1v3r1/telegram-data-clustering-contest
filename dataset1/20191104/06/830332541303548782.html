      <h1>Tech stocks rally in Asia on news of pending Huawei reprieve</h1>
      <h2>Wilbur Ross: New licenses coming 'shortly'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T06:55:23+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Sherisse Pham, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG - Asian markets edged up on Monday, followinglast week's <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/investing/sp-nasdaq-dow-stock-market-record/index.html">gains on Wall Street</a> as well as news of a potential reprieve for Huawei.</p>
      <p>South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng each rose 1.3%, and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.7%. Japan markets are closed for a holiday.</p>
      <p>Chip makers got a boost after US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/ross-optimistic-on-china-trade-deal-says-huawei-licenses-coming?srnd=premium">told Bloomberg</a> on Sunday that licenses allowing US companies to sell toHuawei "will be forthcoming very shortly." He said his office has received 260 requests for licenses.</p>
      <p>That reprieve would have an immediate effect on American companies restricted from supplying to Huawei, but global supply chains would also get a lift if the Chinese tech company were to ramp up production.</p>
      <p>South Korean chipmaker Samsung rose 1.8%. SK Hynix was up 2%.</p>
      <p>Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications company and a leading smartphone brand, has become a pawn in the larger US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Ross said Monday that the United States is engaged in a "long overdue" overhaul of its trade relationship with China.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an economic summit in Bangkok, Thailand, he said that the two sides "are very far along with phase one," referring to a preliminary trade agreement.</p>
