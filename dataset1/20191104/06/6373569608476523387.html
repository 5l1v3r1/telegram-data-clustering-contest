      <h2>Rebecca Hele's life has been transformed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T06:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jak Ball</a></address>
      <p>A Plymouth woman says that Slimming World has changed her life and helped her deal with the death of her young child.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Rebecca Hele had lost her confidence, was unhappy with her weight and was trying for a baby without success.</p>
      <p>But 11 months after that, things couldn’t have been any more different for the then 30-year-old.</p>
      <p>Bex joined Slimming World to support her mother, but soon found that weight was dropping off her. She was still eating plenty of her favourite foods but a more balanced diet and some understanding about food saw a body transformation she wasn’t expecting.</p>
      <p>In just 11 months Bex lost three-and-a-half stone and in the same week that she discovered that she had reached her target weight, Bex found out that she was pregnant with her first child.</p>

      <p>"My husband and I had been trying for a baby but it just wasn’t happening,” Bex said. “I had lost confidence in myself, my image and I was feeling pretty low.</p>
      <p>"Thinking I was supporting my mum, I went along to my first group and instantly felt welcome. All of the preconceived ideas I had were wrong.</p>
      <p>"There wasn’t any judgement and I soon realised I loved going to the group, I could continue to eat lots of my favourite foods and soon the weight was dropping off me.</p>
      <p>"In 11 months, I lost three-and-a-half stones. I got my target weight the very same week I found out I was pregnant with our first child, Tommy. I continued to follow the plan throughout the pregnancy and felt very much in control of my weight all the way through.</p>
      <p>"Slimming World’s food optimising plan is well suited to both pregnancy and breastfeeding and Slimming World work in partnership with the Royal College of Midwives."</p>

      <p>Sadly her second child, Jack, was born with a rare heart condition and passed away at just nine days old.</p>
      <p>However, Bex – now a Slimming World consultant – continued to attend meetings where she found great comfort and support.</p>
