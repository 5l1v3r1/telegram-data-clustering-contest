The Internet Is Scared Of An Angry Lady Named ‘Kidz Bop Karen’
04 Nov 2019, 06:25 by Michelle Rennex
First there was Permit Patty, then came Barbecue Becky and now there’s a new angry middle-aged white woman in town: “Kidz Bop Karen”.
If you were wondering why Kidz Bop suddenly started trending this weekend, well, you’re in for a real treat. Let me introduce you to our new queen who is now destined to live in internet infamy forever, Kidz Bop Karen.



In the full version of the video, we get a little more context into why Karen was so angry. Uploaded by Chelsea Klein, the passenger recording the events unfolding, it appears that Karen is upset because the Uber-type service Chelsea was travelling in almost got into a bit of a fender bender with her.
“She thinks it cute that her driver almost hit my kids”, Karen likely over-exaggerates. “And she thinks she needs to take a video of it instead of apologising like a sane human.”
Despite the driver apologising and taking blame for the almost-accident, Kidz Bop Karen was more focused on getting an apology from “the bitch-ass hoe that told me to calm down”.
Her words, not mine.
But Chelsea wasn’t having it. After reminding Karen that her kids were still in the car and could likely hear their mum slinging around the word bitch, Karen blew up. She uttered the words that will be written in history books until the end of time.
“My kids can’t hear me calling you a bitch,” Karen said. “They can’t hear me because they’re listening to Kidz Bop.”
And thus, a new meme was born.









Now while no one knows the mystery woman’s real name, the internet were quick to crown her with her new, well-deserved title — Kidz Bop Karen. People online we’re just so taken aback by Kidz Bop Karen that some of them couldn’t decide if they wanted to be Karen…






…or be the kids in the car innocently listening to Kidz Bop.












Whoever you want to be in this scenario, I think we can all agree that Kidz Bop are probably loving all this free promo.
