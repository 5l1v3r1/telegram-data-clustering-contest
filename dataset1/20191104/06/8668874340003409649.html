      <p>Perenara took out the try of the year award for his stunning finish in the All Blacks’ pool play win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup/teams/namibia">Namibia</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Asked how proud he was to win the award, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=12282092">Perenara ignored the question and instead used the chance to heap praise on South Africa</a>.</p>

      <p>“Cheers mate, thanks for that. I just want to take this moment to congratulate South Africa. Siya [Kolisi] and your guys’ accomplishment. What you guys have done is truly inspiring. I congratulate all the other winners and your awards but what you guys have done inspired a nation, so good s***,” Perenara said to a big applause from the audience.</p>

      <p>He was presented the award by former All Blacks and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes">Hurricanes</a> teammate Conrad Smith</p>
      <p>A day after winning the Rugby World Cup, South Africa won the trifecta of team, coach and men’s player of the year.</p>
      <p>England centre Emily Scarratt, back playing 15s after two years of sevens, was the women’s player of the year.</p>
      <p>Flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/pieter-steph-du-toit/">Pieter-Steph du Toit</a> received the men’s award after starting and starring in nine of the Springboks’ 11 tests this year, including the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> final win against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>Du Toit became the first South African to win the award since 2007, when Bryan Habana earned it in the same year the Springboks last won the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Du Toit was nominated with teammate <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/cheslin-kolbe/">Cheslin Kolbe</a>, Wales captain Alun <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/wyn-jones/">Wyn Jones</a>, New Zealand flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes/players/ardie-savea/">Ardie Savea</a>, England flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a> and United States hooker Joe Taufete’e.</p>
      <p>Rassie Erasmus was named top coach after leading his team of the year <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> to a record-tying third World Cup crown after a pool defeat to the All Blacks, and a first Rugby Championship in 10 years.</p>
      <p>France flyhalf <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/romain-ntamack/">Romain Ntamack</a>, who made his debut at center in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> in February, was the breakthrough player of the year ahead of England wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/joe-cokanasiga/">Joe Cokanasiga</a> and South Africa scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies.</p>
      <p>The sevens players of the year were Jerry Tuwai of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> and Ruby Tui of New Zealand, and the try of the year was TJ Perenara’s spectacular breakout and finish in New Zealand’s win against Namibia in the World Cup.</p>
