      <p>LOS ANGELES - It's only been two weeks, and R&amp;B singer Frank Ocean has already released another surprise single. Are we in heaven?</p>
      <p>Ocean released "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjjV8fD9D2c&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mhnfPxFHqEfJoI67pBBIqk_Xg3zaBVy_s">In My Room</a>" on Saturday through Apple Music. The song is currently unavailable on any other streaming platform.</p>
      <p>The new track comes on the heels of Ocean's recent single "DHL," which was released on October 19 after premiering at the end of "Blonded," his Beats 1 radio show.</p>
      <p>Ocean hosted a Halloween edition of his PrEP+ clubnight in New York on <a href="https://blonded.world/">Thursday</a>, where fans got a special treat when "In My Room" was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/frank-ocean-releases-new-track-room-2563891">played</a> during the event.</p>
      <p>"DHL" was released with art depicting a man sitting on a chair with one arm raised and his head in a bag, a unique pose that matched one of 13 silhouettes beneath the image. Fans had theorized the silhouettes represent new songs.</p>
      <p>It's unclear if that's true. However, "In My Room" was also paired with cover art matching one of 17 silhouettes.</p>
