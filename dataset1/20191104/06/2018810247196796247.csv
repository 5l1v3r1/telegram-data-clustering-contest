This Week In Games: Red Dead Stranding
04 Nov 2019, 06:29 by Alex Walker



Howdy, partner.
If you've been waiting for Rockstar's Wild West to finally come to PC, then this week is for you. It's launching through the Epic Games Store, Rockstar's own launcher, Humble Bundle and Green Man Gaming this week, but if you really want the game through Steam then you'll have to wait another month.
And, of course, there's Hideo Kojima.



If you just have to see what Death Stranding is all about, you'll finally be able to from this week. There's a ton of footage that can't be released until after the game's launch too — the discussion later this week should be plenty fun.
There's a few standouts on the PC too. Planet Zoo drops later this week, and there's a new Need for Speed. The Switch gets a Professor Layton title and Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, if you're into Tokyo 2020 themed mini-games.
There's definitely plenty to choose from. Here's the full roster:

Death Stranding (PS4)
Red Dead Redemption 2 (PC)
Just Dance 2020 (Switch, PS4, Xbox One)
Planet Zoo (PC)
Jumanji: The Video Game (PC)
Evolution Battle Simulator (PC)
Alfonzo's Arctic Adventure (PC)
SUPERVERSE (PC)
Skybolt Zack (PC)
King's League 2 (PC)
Need For Speed Heat (PC, Xbox, PS4)
Tokyo Dark Rememberance (Switch)
Disgaea 4 (PC, Switch)
Stay Cool, Kobayashi-san! (Xbox, Switch)
Blacksad Under The Skin (PS4, Xbox)
Strange Telephone (Switch)
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (Switch)
Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy (Switch)
New Super Lucky's Tale (Switch)
House of Golf (Switch)
One Person Story (Switch)
Disney's Tsum Tsum Festival (Switch)
Super Street Racer (Switch)
Garfield Kart: Furious Racing (PC, Switch)
Football Game (Switch)
Ritual: Crown of Horns (Switch)
Sturmwind EX (Xbox, Switch)
Animus Harbinger (Switch)

Onto the trailers. You know which one we're starting with, of course.
Need for Speed.
Just kidding.
It's Garfield Kart.






























So, who's still on board for Death Stranding? And who's diving into Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC? Or is something else catching your eye this week?
