為何S型是自古以來最佳拍照站姿？

04 Nov 2019, 06:36

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】從專業模特、普通百姓，到名畫中的維納斯，古今中外，都在採用對立式平衡站姿拍照、入畫。近期一份研究顯示，這種站姿讓一側身體的腰臀比例看起來更小，更迷人。
對立式平衡站姿（contrapposto，被人戲稱為S型站姿）就是把身體的重量主要放在一條腿上，上半身略微傾斜的站立姿勢。重量放在左腳還是右腳通常是個人的習慣或依周圍環境而定。
之前的調查顯示日常生活中女性腰臀比例為0.7最吸引人，而研究發現，最吸引人的照片上模特的腰臀比還不到這個數值，意味著腰身更纖細些。人們普遍認為，較小的腰臀比體現了優秀的生育能力和健康的活力。
近期發表的一份新研究揭示，站姿和視覺角度可以改變腰臀比的視覺效果，S型讓一側看起來更有曲線，加上兩邊不同的反差，都讓畫中人更具有魅力。
研究人員找來68位大學生，包括25名男性和43名女性，向他們展示一個電腦虛構的女性模型直立和S型站姿、從8個不同的角度拍攝的照片，詢問他們覺得人物是否吸引人，同時追蹤他們眼球移動情況。
詢問結果顯示，男女受試者都認為S型站姿的人物看起來比直立站姿的人物更吸引人，特別是從正面、背面和側面這幾個視覺角度。
眼球移動追蹤數據顯示，對於直立站姿的人物，男女受試者的眼神停留在人物左側和右側身體的時間幾乎一樣長；然而對於S型站姿的人物，不論從哪個角度的照片，受試者總是先掃到腰臀比較小的一側、眼神停留在這一側的時間也略長一些、掃到這一側的次數也多。也就是說，曲線感更強的一側更吸引眼球。
研究人員認為，S型站姿導致兩側身體腰臀比的變化也是讓人物奪人眼球的一個因素，可能這就解釋了為什麼特別的步態和一些舞姿被認為很吸引人。
「比如，模特的貓步、肚皮舞等，都起到突出身體的曲線並使其出現視覺變化的效果，使腰臀比看起來小於0.7，這讓人們覺得這些動作很有吸引力。」研究者之一加拿大不列顛哥倫比亞大學的帕佐伊（Farid Pazhoohi）說，「女性穿著高跟鞋走路也會產生類似的誇大S型的效果。」

Why is the S-type the best photo standing position since ancient times?

04 Nov 2019, 06:36

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 04, 2019] From professional models, ordinary people, to Venus in famous paintings, ancient and modern Chinese and foreign, they are using the opposite balance to stand and take pictures. A recent study showed that this stance makes the waist-to-hip ratio of one side of the body look smaller and more attractive.
The opposite balance stance (contrapposto, dubbed S-type standing position) is the standing posture in which the weight of the body is mainly placed on one leg and the upper body is slightly inclined. Whether the weight is placed on the left or right foot is usually a personal habit or depending on the surrounding environment.
Previous surveys have shown that the proportion of women's waist-to-hip ratio in daily life is 0.7, and the study found that the most attractive photo on the model's waist-to-hip ratio is less than this value, meaning that the waist is slimmer. It is generally believed that a smaller waist-to-hip ratio reflects excellent fertility and healthy vitality.
A recent study reveals that standing and visual angles can change the visual effect of the waist-to-hip ratio. The S-shape makes one side look more curved, and the contrast between the two sides makes the people in the painting more attractive.
The researchers recruited 68 college students, including 25 men and 43 women, to show them a computer fictional female model standing upright and S-station, taking pictures from 8 different angles and asking them if they thought the characters were attractive. While tracking their eye movements.
The results of the inquiry showed that both male and female subjects thought that the S-shaped standing characters looked more attractive than the standing figures, especially from the front, back and side.
Eye movement tracking data shows that for people standing upright, the eyes of male and female subjects stay on the left and right side of the character for almost the same length of time; however, for the figure of the S-type standing, regardless of the angle from which the photo is taken, The person always scans to the smaller side of the waist and hips, and the eyes stay on this side for a little longer, and the number of times to sweep to this side is also higher. In other words, the side with a stronger curve is more attractive.
The researchers believe that the S-type standing pose changes in the waist-to-hip ratio of the two sides is also a factor that makes people eye-catching, which may explain why special gait and some dances are considered attractive.
""For example, the cat's catwalk, belly dance, etc. all play a role in highlighting the body's curve and making it visually change, making the waist-to-hip ratio look less than 0.7, which makes people feel that these movements are very attractive."" Farid Pazhoohi of the University of British Columbia in Canada said, ""Women walking in high heels will produce a similarly exaggerated S-shaped effect.""
