Mothercare is on the brink of collapse, placing 2,500 jobs at risk, according to reports.
The troubled retailer is said to be ready to place the UK business into administration, which could see all stores close.
The listed company is in advanced talks with lenders about fresh refinancing, according to Sky News.
But the radical restricting plans would not directly affect its publicly quoted parent company, The Mirror reports.
Mothercare's UK business represents only a small part of its overall group sales and is now dominated by its franchising business outside the UK.
Mothercare has been trying for several months to find a buyer for its UK business.

The company has around 2,500 employees who are now facing redundancy.

The struggling retailer, which fell to a £36.3million loss last year under a controversial company voluntary arrangement (CVA).



The news comes just months after Mothercare sold off its Early Learning Centre arm to The Entertainer for £13.5million.

It blamed lower iPad sales led by its store closure programme as well as a smaller 'Toy offer' with less discounting.
By the end of March 2019, the chain's business store count had fallen from 137 in May 2018 to 79.
