      <h1>13-year-old scientist may have designed better version of Hyperloop</h1>
      <h2>Concept would run along existing rail corridors</h2>

      <p>GARDEN CITY, N.Y. - Several rival companies may be hard at work trying to get Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept off the ground, but hurtling across country -- maybe even across continents -- at 600 miles per hour in a low-pressure steel tube <a href="https://cnn.com/travel/article/how-long-hyperloop/index.html">still feels far from reality.</a></p>
      <p>But 13-year-old New York student Caroline Crouchley may have invented a more economically viable and eco-friendly Hyperloop solution.</p>
      <p>Crouchley's idea, which just won second place in the annual <a href="https://www.youngscientistlab.com/challenge">3M Young Scientist Challenge</a>, is to build pneumatic tubes next to existing train tracks.</p>
      <p>Magnetic shuttles would travel through these vacuum tubes, connected via magnetic arm to trains traveling on the existing tracks.</p>
      <p>This system would utilize current train tracks, thereby cutting infrastructure costs and, Crouchley says, eradicating the potential safety risk posed by propelling passengers in a vacuum.</p>
      <p>There'd be no need for trains to use diesel or electric motors, making the trains lighter and more fuel-efficient.</p>
      <p>This is important to Crouchley, who aims to devise active solutions to the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>"I pinpointed transportation as something I wanted to work on because if we can make trains more efficient, then we can eliminate the amount of cars, trucks and buses on the road," Crouchley tells <a href="https://cnn.com/travel">CNN Travel.</a></p>
      <h3>Real world inspiration</h3>
      <p>Crouchley, from Garden City in New York state, focused on train travel as a solution because her father and brother regularly travel by rail into New York City.</p>
      <p>Her science teacher encouraged her to enter the Young Scientist Challenge, which invites middle schoolers in the US to submit a video outlining an ingenious solution to an everyday problem.</p>
      <p>"After I got my inspiration, I did a lot of research on my design and on Hyperloop and Maglev. And I put my design on paper and later put it into Autodesk Inventor [a computer program for 3D design]," says Crouchley.</p>
      <p>Maglev, Crouchley noted, is a very efficient, but expensive, train design.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, she concluded that more traditional forms of Hyperloops have their flaws.</p>
      <p>"Hyperloop is very high risk," says Crouchley.</p>
      <p>"My design can be less expensive and more efficient than current train technology that's out there already. It's also safer than Hyperloop.</p>
      <p>My design can rely on 100% renewable energy, so it eliminates the need for a diesel engine or an electric motor, which makes the train lighter, so it can move faster."</p>
      <h3>Future steps</h3>
      <p>Crouchley's design was awarded second place in the Young Scientist Challenge, with 14-year-old Californian Kara Fan, who invented a first aid liquid bandage designed to reduce the risk of superbug infections, nabbing the top spot.</p>
      <p>Crouchley says participating in the competition was a lot of fun. Along the way, she worked with a mentor, presented her invention to a panel of scientists and worked together with other innovative young scientists.</p>
      <p>The next step to making her Hyperloop dream a reality? Building a bigger model to work out how the concept will work on a larger scale.</p>
