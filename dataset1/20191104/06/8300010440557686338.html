      <p>DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, Calif. (KABC) -- The former Metro Blue Line reopened this weekend under a new name and a familiar face helped cut the ribbon.<br/><br/>Rapper Snoop Dogg was on hand as the A Line once again welcomed visitors. Sections of the line had been closed since January as part of a $350 million improvement project. Crews installed new train control systems, overhead power systems, digital screens and signage. It's all meant to improve service along the 22-mile route connecting Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The name change from the Blue Line to the A Line is part of Metro's <a href="https://abc7.com/society/la-metro-may-move-away-from-color-coded-rail-lines/4288954/">plan to rename its routes from colors to letters</a>. Next year, the Red Line will change to the B Line. Other lines will be renamed over the next few years.<br/><br/>Snoop Dogg served as emcee of Saturday's ribbon cutting ceremony. He described how he relied on the Blue Line to get from Long Beach to downtown L.A. before he landed a record deal. He also praised city leaders for the improvements.<br/><br/>"To see them put something back into the community like this and give it a new name or some new tricks... It's going to be be running through cities like Willowbrook, Compton, Long Beach. You understand what I'm saying? The real cities," said the rapper.</p>
