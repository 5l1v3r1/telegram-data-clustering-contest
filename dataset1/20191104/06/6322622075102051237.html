      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): The Malaysian government expects to start issuing bauxite mining and export licences again in January 2020 since the ban on such activities in Pahang was lifted in April 2019.</p>
      <p>Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister Dr Xavier Jayakumar said in Parliament here today the licence, which will be part of a six-month pilot to test a new standard operating procedure (SOP) covering pre-to-post bauxite mining, will only allow such operations to be undertaken in Gebeng, Pahang, in the initial stage.</p>
      <p>Dr Xavier said the government will reevaluate the implementation of the SOP before allowing licensees to undertake bauxite mining across Pahang.</p>
      <p>"The SOP will impose stringent conditions beginning with the application process, transport, central stockpiling and exports.</p>
      <p>"Among rules to adhere to include the approval of the environmental impact assessment report, minimum size of the mining site, and bauxite processing [procedure]," he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Xavier was responding to a question by Kemaman MP Che Alias Hamid on the testing of the new SOP.</p>
      <p>Later, Dr Xavier told reporters outside the Parliament that at least three companies have applied for the Gebeng licence.</p>
      <p>"They are all local companies," he said. Dr Xavier said they are required to adhere to a sizeable capital expenditure requirement considering the stringent SOP proposed.</p>
      <p>"After they follow the requirements for the SOP, they will send a letter to the ministry to obtain the licence," Dr Xavier said.</p>
      <p>Dr Xavier expects the government to issue its first bauxite mining licence under the new SOP at the earliest by January 2020, from which the six-month pilot period will commence.</p>
      <p>According to news reports, bauxite mining in Pahang was suspended between 2016 and March 31, 2019 due environmental pollution concerns.</p>
      <p>In February 2019, it was reported that Dr Xavier announced that the moratorium on the mining and export of bauxite from Pahang, ending on March 31, 2019, would not be extended.</p>
