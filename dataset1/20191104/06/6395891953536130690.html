      <p><b>LEBANON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A harness racing track and casino in Ohio has proposed a $100 million expansion project.</p>
      <p>Miami Valley Gaming and Racing in southwestern Ohio's Warren County is considering adding a hotel, restaurant, parking garage and additional gambling machines.</p>
      <p>Domenic Mancini, the racino's president and general manager, says the expansion will allow the racino to attract business from other major cities beyond Cincinnati and Dayton.</p>
      <p>The project will create around 300 jobs during construction and about 100 permanent positions. It's expected to be completed during the first half of 2021.</p>
      <p>The proposed hotel will have 194 rooms. The parking garage will have spaces for about 1,000 cars.</p>
      <p>The expansion would provide up to 250 more video lottery terminal machines and more than 10,000 square feet (929 square meters) of additional floor space.</p>
