      <p>Indian IT services major <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>Ltd said on Monday it received no evidence to support the allegations in a whistleblower letter from last month, sending shares up as much as 6.5% in morning trade.</p>
      <p>A letter, claimed to have been written by employees of the company in October, said Chief Executive <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/salil-parekh">Salil Parekh </a>instigated them and others to bypass approvals for large deals, fearing a negative impact on shares from reduced profit.</p>
      <p>"There is no supporting evidence that has been received by the company along with these anonymous complaints to substantiate the allegations," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>said in a letter to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) dated November 2.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/infosys">Infosys </a>said last month that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had launched a probe into whistleblower claims that the Indian software services firm used 'unethical practices' to boost revenue and profit.</p>
      <p>The complaints were still under investigation and the company was not in a position to determine "concreteness, credibility and materiality of complaints," the Bengaluru-based company said in its letter to the NSE.</p>
      <p>The letter was in reply to the NSE's request to the company to explain why it had not disclosed the receipt of the letter.</p>
      <p>Infosys said since the allegations were not deemed "material" under Indian regulation, the company was not obligated to disclose them.</p>
