香港警黑合作引恐慌 學防身術者人數爆增

04 Nov 2019, 06:33

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】自香港反送中以來，在港府的縱容下，港警越來越肆無忌憚的瘋狂鎮壓港民。此外，還有具有黑道背景的人襲擊港人，被認為「警黑合作」。有港媒報導指出，報名防身術課程的市民至今多了3到4倍，相信是因為缺乏安全感，所以希望有能力自衛。
根據《香港電臺》報導，有拳館負責人指出，在721元朗事件後，報名防身術的市民比以往多了3到4倍，學員不僅有年輕人，甚至還有小孩及長者。負責人認為，這是因為港人缺乏安全感，希望有一技在身確保自身安全。
報導引述學員阿朗的話，他承認在元朗事件後，感受到自己的能力不足以保護自己和家人，又認為警察不能保障市民安全，不想被襲擊受傷，所以決定學習防身術，救人及自救。另一名學員柔伊表示，學習防身術是想在有需要的時候，懂得避開危險。
報導指出，也有拳館教練表示，聽聞警方正擬定收集教防身術教練的個資，自己也在名單之上，他認為整件事有如白色恐怖，擔心自己被警方針對，已經暫停教年輕人防身術的課程。
此前，據報，為了對抗警員濫捕濫暴，香港中大學生會在校內舉辦相關「練武班」，教導自衛術及逃脫技巧以保護自己。
據《路透》報導，一名31歲的課程參與者Pino說，她以前是跳舞的，參加各類舞蹈課程，包括爵士、嘻哈音樂，以及鋼管舞。Pino表示：現在「我已停止跳舞，我現在習武。」她解釋：「現時我們需要作戰，而不是跳舞。」
Pino在資訊科技界任職，在前線擔當「義務護士」的角色，為在場傷者包紮，並非所謂的「勇武派」，但她也參加練武班。她說，教練會教授如何逃避警方拘捕等。課程也會播放真實衝突時的畫面。
有示威者透露：在過去數月出現多個同類課程，這是其中一個。
在中大舉辦這些恆常自衛課程的人士William Cheung說：「不僅站在前線的人士或年輕人，我們也要學習這些技巧保護自己。」
William Cheung說，如果不保護好自己，不知道何時會被打死，或被打至受傷或需送院。
在10月份的一個早上，中大圖書館外約有10多名學生練習劍擊，他們使用泡綿軟棍模擬警方的警棍，並嘗試以背包作為盾牌抵擋攻擊。
一名男參加者說：「今日課堂的主題為逃走」，他認為示威衝突並沒有結束的跡象，因此這樣的課程是有必要的。

Hong Kong police black cooperation leads to panic

04 Nov 2019, 06:33

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Since the reversal of Hong Kong, under the connivance of the Hong Kong Government, the Hong Kong police have increasingly unscrupulously suppressed the Hong Kong people. In addition, there are people with a background in the underworld who attacked Hong Kong people and are considered to be ""police-black cooperation."" Some Hong Kong media reports pointed out that the number of citizens who applied for self-defense courses has been three to four times more. I believe that because of the lack of security, I hope to have the ability to defend myself.
According to Radio Television Hong Kong, the person in charge of the boxing hall pointed out that after the 721 Yuen Long incident, the number of people who applied for self-defense was three to four times more than before. The students not only had young people, but even children and the elderly. The person in charge believes that this is because the Hong Kong people lack security and hope to have a skill to ensure their own safety.
The newspaper quoted the student Alang as saying that he admitted that after the Yuen Long incident, he felt that his ability was not enough to protect himself and his family. He also believed that the police could not protect the safety of the public and did not want to be attacked and injured. So he decided to learn self-defense, save and save himself. . Another student, Roy, said that learning self-defense is to avoid the danger when needed.
The report pointed out that there are also boxing coaches who have heard that the police are drafting a fund for collecting self-defense coaches. They are also on the list. He thinks that the whole thing is like white horror, and he is worried that he has been targeted by the police. He has stopped teaching young people to defend themselves. Course.
Earlier, it was reported that in order to counter the indiscriminate use of police officers, Hong Kong students will hold relevant ""training classes"" on campus to teach self-defense techniques and escape skills to protect themselves.
According to Reuters, a 31-year-old course participant, Pino, said she used to dance and participate in a variety of dance classes, including jazz, hip hop, and pole dancing. Pino said: ""I have stopped dancing now, I am practicing martial arts now."" She explained: ""We need to fight now, not dance.""
Pino is in the information technology industry and plays the role of ""obligatory nurse"" on the front line. It is not the so-called ""Yongwu School"" for the wounded, but she also participates in the training class. She said that the coach will teach how to avoid police arrests. The course also plays a picture of the actual conflict.
Some demonstrators revealed that there have been many similar courses in the past few months, and this is one of them.
William Cheung, a person who runs these constant self-defense courses at CUHK, said: ""Not only those who are on the front line, but also young people, we must learn these skills to protect ourselves.""
William Cheung said that if you don't protect yourself, you don't know when you will be killed, or you will be injured or need to be sent to hospital.
On the morning of October, about 10 students outside the Zhongda Library practiced sword fights. They used foam sticks to simulate police batons and tried to use the backpack as a shield to resist the attack.
A male participant said: ""The theme of today's class is escape."" He believes that the demonstration conflict does not end, so such a course is necessary.
