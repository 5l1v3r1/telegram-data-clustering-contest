中共輪番運動式折騰 民營企業家陷恐慌

04 Nov 2019, 06:37

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】剛剛結束的中共四中全會明確定調「國進民退」大方向，近日，一名大陸學者批評中共當局折騰私企的言論在網路熱傳。該學者表示，中國民營企業家陷入恐慌，因為「公權太任性了」。他披露，中共輪番的運動式折騰，拖欠民營企業10多萬億不還，民營企業家沒有一個過的好的。
10月底落幕的四中全會明言「以公有制為主體」，坐實了當局正在推動「國進民退」的政策，進一步壓制私企。不少學者認為，當局是在走回頭路，此舉無助於穩定民營企業家。
近日，曾任全國工商聯農產商會代表的蔡曉鵬有關民營企業的一段講話在網絡罕見熱傳。蔡曉鵬在9月舉行的「2019秋季新莫干山閉門研討會」上表示，民營企業過得不好，民營企業家陷入恐慌。
他表示，當局「『經濟整治運動化』已經搞7、8年了，有數據統計，輪番不停的運動式折騰波及了1000多萬個經濟實體，造成10多萬億的損失；加上國企和政府賴了民營企業10多萬億硬不還，民營企業家沒有一個說過得好的。」
「我有兩個群，有2000多個民營企業家，沒有一個說好的……」
蔡曉鵬還指出：「企業為什麼恐慌啊，公權太任性了！或縱容、鼓勵或約束不住！近兩年，中央發了不少文件，涉民企財產保護的，沒有一條真落實的。甚至沒有頒布追責公權濫用的法定程序。」
他直言，「當局有沒有建立起讓民營企業家免予恐懼的權利的這種制度環境？沒有。」中國還沒有建立起對民營企業財產和企業家人身保護的法律機制，沒有法律就沒有對公權濫用的問責。
「所以在北京發生那麼多的大規模拆遷，沒什麼賠償；逼死了那麼多人，沒人問！都不敢也不讓報導出來。涉及無數平民百姓私權保護與公權任性的衝突，既沒有行政法律糾錯機制，也沒有行政法律糾錯平台。」
據統計，中國民營經濟貢獻了50%以上的稅收，60%以上的GDP，70%以上的技術創新，80%以上的城鎮勞動就業。然而中共多年來一直重國企，輕私企，2018年一波私有經濟退場論，更讓民營企業不寒而慄。
加之受美中貿易戰影響，民營企業遭受重創，到處瀰漫著悲觀情緒，中國經濟也連帶面臨嚴峻挑戰。去年11月，習近平不得不親自出面安撫民營企業，稱民營企業家是「自己人」。
然而，一年過去了，許多民營企業家覺得「政府沒有把他們當自家人」，民營企業照舊生存艱難。不少中國商界大佬也頻頻「出事」，繼阿里巴巴總裁馬云「被退休」後，騰訊的馬化騰、百度李彥宏和聯想創始人柳傳志也相繼「被卸任」。
與此同時，杭州市政府要向杭州企業派駐「政府事務代表」。有網民嘲諷說，馬雲走了，政委來了，好比鬼子進了村，這是要革私企的命。
柳傳志此前接受官媒採訪的一段視頻也在網上罕見曝光熱傳，柳傳志語出驚人，他表示中共官場腐敗不遏止的話，中國經濟肯定崩盤。他還自曝，民營企業最怕的是三件事：
第一就是不安全，中共官員腐敗，沒有真正的法制，說你好你就好，說你有罪就有罪，讓人覺的極度不安全，這是我們第一怕的事情。
第二就是政府不作為，而且會有一堆的理由，這些東西不但極大的影響了效率，也會使民企喪失信心，這也做不成，那也做不成，那就幹脆甭做，這也是我們怕的。
第三個是怕（政府）說的跟做的不一樣，這些不但影響經濟，人心混亂，對於後邊的孩子更是……這些東西其實是我們所怕的。
中央社引述一位經濟學者表示，當前中國面臨經濟成長壓力，但是「黨管一切」的做法只會讓情況惡化。企業頻繁舉行政治學習，民企也都設有黨支部，有黨務活動的要求，這些都會增加開支，降低生產。
9月初，網路上傳出一段神秘錄音，疑似一名中共高層官員透露出中美貿易戰已引發中共的統治危機。該官員提到，目前中共高層有三股勢力在鬥爭，未來當局可能恢復當年的計劃經濟體系，屆時所有個體民營資產將全部被搞掉。該錄音內容真實性雖未得到確認，但與當下中國時局驚人對應。

The CCP’s round-the-clock sports toss

04 Nov 2019, 06:37

[New Tang Dynasty, Beijing time, November 04, 2019] The just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party clearly decided to adjust the direction of ""national advancement and retreat"". Recently, a mainland scholar criticized the Chinese Communist Party's remarks on tossing private enterprises on the Internet. The scholar said that Chinese private entrepreneurs are in a panic because ""public power is too capricious."" He disclosed that the CCP’s reversal of sports-style tossing and owing more than 10 trillion yuan to private enterprises did not return, and private entrepreneurs did not have a good one.
The Fourth Plenary Session, which ended at the end of October, stated that ""public ownership is the mainstay"" and that the authorities are promoting the policy of ""national advancement and retreat"" to further suppress private enterprises. Many scholars believe that the authorities are going back, which will not help stabilize private entrepreneurs.
Recently, Cai Xiaopeng, a former representative of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that a speech about private enterprises was rare in the Internet. Cai Xiaopeng said in the ""2019 Autumn New Moganshan Closed Seminar"" held in September that private enterprises are not doing well and private entrepreneurs are in panic.
He said that the authorities have been engaged in ""economic rectification and movement"" for seven or eight years. According to statistics, the reversal of sports-style toss has affected more than 10 million economic entities, resulting in more than 10 trillion losses; And the government relies on more than 10 trillion private enterprises, and no private entrepreneurs have said it well.""
""I have two groups and more than 2,000 private entrepreneurs. None of them said good...""
Cai Xiaopeng also pointed out: ""Why do companies panic, public rights are too self-willed! Or connivance, encouragement or restraint! In the past two years, the central government has issued a lot of documents, and the protection of private enterprise property has not been implemented. Promulgate a statutory procedure to pursue the abuse of public rights.""
He bluntly said, ""Is there any institutional environment in which the authorities have established the right to free private entrepreneurs from fear? No."" China has not yet established a legal mechanism for the protection of private enterprise property and entrepreneurs. Without law, there is no right. Accountability for abuse of public rights.
""So there are so many large-scale demolition in Beijing, there is no compensation; so many people are forced to die, no one asks! I dare not let the newspapers come out. It involves the conflict between the protection of the private rights of countless civilians and the will of public power. There is no administrative legal error correction mechanism and no administrative legal error correction platform.""
According to statistics, China's private economy contributes more than 50% of tax revenue, more than 60% of GDP, more than 70% of technological innovation, and more than 80% of urban labor employment. However, the CCP has been focusing on state-owned enterprises and light private enterprises for many years. In 2018, a wave of private economy exited the theory, which made private enterprises shudder.
Coupled with the impact of the US-China trade war, private enterprises have been hit hard, pessimism is everywhere, and the Chinese economy is facing serious challenges. In November last year, Xi Jinping had to personally come forward to appease private enterprises, saying that private entrepreneurs are ""owners.""
However, after one year has passed, many private entrepreneurs feel that ""the government has not treated them as their own family."" Private enterprises still struggle to survive. Many Chinese business people have also frequently ""faulted"". After Alibaba's president Ma Yun was ""retired"", Tencent's Ma Huateng, Baidu Li Yanhong and Lenovo founder Liu Chuanzhi were also ""dismissed.""
At the same time, the Hangzhou Municipal Government has to station ""government affairs representatives"" to Hangzhou enterprises. Some netizens ridiculed that Ma Yun was gone, and the political commissar came, just like a devil entered the village. This is to kill the private enterprise.
Liu Chuanzhi’s previous video interviewed by the official media was also rarely exposed on the Internet. Liu Chuanzhi’s words were amazing. He said that the corruption of the Chinese Communist Party’s officialdom was not stopped, and the Chinese economy must have collapsed. He also revealed that private enterprises are most afraid of three things:
The first is insecurity. The CCP officials are corrupt. There is no real legal system. If you say hello, you are good. It is sinful to say that you are guilty. It is extremely unsafe. This is our first fear.
The second is that the government does not act, and there will be a bunch of reasons. These things not only greatly affect the efficiency, but also cause the private enterprises to lose their confidence. If this is not possible, then it will not be done, then simply do it. This is also our fear. of.
The third is that the government (the government) said that it is not the same as doing it. These not only affect the economy, but also the chaos of the people. For the children behind it, it is... these things are actually what we are afraid of.
The Central News Agency quoted an economist as saying that China is currently facing economic growth pressures, but the ""party-management"" approach will only worsen the situation. Enterprises frequently hold political studies, and private enterprises also have party branches and requirements for party activities, which will increase spending and reduce production.
At the beginning of September, the Internet uploaded a mysterious recording. It is suspected that a senior CCP official revealed that the Sino-US trade war has triggered the CCP’s ruling crisis. The official mentioned that there are currently three forces at the top of the CCP’s struggle, and the future authorities may resume the planned economy of the year, when all individual private assets will be destroyed. Although the authenticity of the recorded content has not been confirmed, it is surprisingly corresponding to the current Chinese situation.
