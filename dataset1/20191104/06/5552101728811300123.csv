台北市政府副發言人「學姐」黃瀞瑩傳出遭市府顧問劉嘉仁言語騷擾，甚至關門與她獨處，被質疑可能涉性騷擾。劉嘉仁今天中午向台北市長柯文哲請辭獲准，據轉述，他認為此事件已造成家人困擾，也造成市府團隊困擾，因此主動請辭接受調查。
劉嘉仁並發表聲明稿表示，非常感謝這段時日大家對他的關心，這段日子引發社會紛擾，感到抱歉，也謝謝柯市長，在第一時間同意提出獨立調查的要求，「對於自己的清白深具信心」；為了避免更多的指涉，今早主動向市長提出辭呈，並期待調查作業完成，報告提出的那一刻到來。
他表示，在進入市府體系之前，自己在醫界從事社區醫療服務長達20年，協助醫療團隊一同照顧病患並勇於承擔；在進入市府幾個月間，認識到自己其實在工作上仍有需要學習的地方。
劉嘉仁表示，衷心期盼一切回歸調查機制；長年的服務經驗，自己的工作總是與在社會中的弱勢站在一起，為這片土地的公共服務，是他的歸屬，將繼續努力。請大家給予調查團隊一個獨立公平的評議空間，「我與各位一樣，靜候真相的到來」。
