TwoDPhysics is a 2D rigid body simulation add-on for Blender 2.80. Since Blender 2.8, it is now possible to create a fully fledged 2D animation in Blender using grease pencil or other means. And there isn't a dedicated 2D rigid body physics engine for Blender so far. The existing physics engine is dedicated for 3D simulations and it requires all kinds of circus to create a 2D simulation using it. So here's the answer to that. Currently it is available for both Windows and Linux.






More Details on How to use the addon and other features are available on Gumroad (Windows and Linux versions)
