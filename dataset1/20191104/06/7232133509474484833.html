      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, bitcoin climbed higher steadily above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/bitcoin-btc-price-weekly-forecast-signs-of-bullish-continuation/">$9,200 and $9,300 resistance levels</a> against the US Dollar. BTC even traded above the $9,350 resistance area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>However, the price struggling to break the $9,400 resistance area. As a result, the price started a fresh decline from the $9,393 high. It traded back below the $9.300 level and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support near $9,240 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. A low was formed near $9,081 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,393 high to $9,081 low. However, the upward move was capped by the $9,240 level and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>It seems like the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,393 high to $9,081 low is acting as a resistance for the bulls. If there are more gains, the $9,300 area is likely to act as a major hurdle in the near term for bitcoin.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside break above the $9,300 resistance, the next stop for the bulls may perhaps be near the $9,380 and $9,400 resistance levels. Conversely, if there is a downward move, an initial support is near the $9,100 level. The main support is near the $9,000 level, below which there is a risk of another decline towards $8,500.</p>
