因為曝光豫章書院，我朋友被報復到自殺

04 Nov 2019, 06:17

【新唐人北京時間2019年11月04日訊】編者按：網聞欄目是給廣大網友來函提供的一個發聲平台，歡迎各位讀者朋友踴躍投稿。因條件所限，編輯部無法核實所有相關事件的具體情況，敬請讀者朋友諒解。
新唐人今日收到網友投稿，全文刊登如下：
當你選擇曝光一個充滿著污穢的行業，往往就代表著，你將自己置身於危險之中。這在兩年前我選擇站出來，曝光豫章書院前，就明白的道理，當時我在考慮了一個星期後，選擇抱著身負重傷的決心去戰鬥。
但世事終究難料，讓我沒想到的是，最終被報復進深淵的人，是我身邊的朋友們。
他們有的被公司辭退，有的選擇了自殺。
可我們付出了這麼多，最終又得到了什麼呢？
當時在我發出《中國到底有多少個楊永信？》後，引起了整個社會的關注。很多曾經有過慘痛回憶的受害者，勇敢地站出來，幫我們戳破了豫章戒網癮學院那些「山長」們的假面具，也有很多可愛的志願者們，投入到這個事業裡面，不惜花費大量的時間精力，幫助那些受害者們維權。
當時的我，被他們威脅要廢一人廢我一隻手，大概是讓我再也寫不了文章。
至於志願者們，從那件事情開始以來，豫章書院的「吳軍豹們」，就在通過各種方式，刺探我們的信息，方法包括但不限於偽裝成受害學生，潛入我們方便受害者與記者溝通的微信群，讓黑客黑志願者的電腦，跟蹤前往南昌的志願者……
在我們其中一次排查的過程中，驚訝地發現吳軍豹自己的小號，就在我們的豫章書院受害學生1群裡，當時我們在那個群裡談論所有行程方針，都在吳軍豹的眼裡。
不過幸好我們做了兩手準備，會對受害者的信息層層審核，還建了2群，3群，核心群等等，按照可靠程度，讓他們進不同的群。1群就是給所有受害學生交流的群，也是因此，吳軍豹才能潛入進來。
在這裡給那些在1群的受害學生致一聲歉，不是我們想要防範你們，只是他們以各種方式刺探我們的真實信息，準備打擊報復，我們是付出了慘重的代價，不得不這樣做的。但儘管做了層層準備，陷入到了個人信息被曝光的困境裡。
其中一個冒充成受害學生的人，加上了我們其中一個志願者，盤問各種「你多大了」、「你是哪裡人」、「你在哪裡上學」、「我能不能加其他志願者的好友」……這類刺探信息的問題；另一邊，一個志願者在和假受害學生聊天的時候，對面說自己有非常關鍵的證據，然後就發過來一個文件，他點進去，結果發現自己的電腦不受自己控制了，在自己操作著，他也略懂一些電腦，知道是自己電腦被黑了，於是立馬拔掉了電源。
其中一個志願者的QQ號被盜，那是我們在QQ上主要的溝通帳號，後來查到盜QQ號的IP，是來自江西南昌（豫章書院所在地）的。
我們的微博維權會官方帳號，被轟炸式舉報，現在連名字都被消除了，只剩下一堆數字：
舉報他們的人，是吳先生，不用想也知道是吳軍豹（豫章書院山長）。
其中一個志願者，是一位女生，一個非常溫柔，熱心的女生，相信參與這件事情的記者、受害學生們都知道她，她在這裡面的網名叫做「子沐」，她從頭到尾，都在努力為這件事情奮戰著，從建立維權會，到聯繫受害學生、記者，花費了數不清的精力，來幫助這些孩子們。並且處於安全考慮，我並沒有選擇讓他們曝光在大眾視野下。她是一個完全不求回報，一個真正的好人。
但這個女生，信息被豫章書院那邊挖得乾乾淨淨，從真實姓名，到手機電話，再到家庭住址，甚至是就讀的大學，沒有什麼是倖免的。
在一次自習課，她被輔導員叫了出去，問她是不是參與了什麼「違法組織」，她並沒有把這件事情告訴身邊的人，連親密的同學都沒有說。那只有一個可能，是豫章書院的人，騷擾到了她的學校裡，說子沐這樣一個為了正義奮戰的姑娘，參與了什麼「違法組織」，她的父親也多次威脅她，不行就讓她退學。
人的精力也是有限的，因為花費了大量的精力，幫助豫章書院的孩子，她的成績也一落千丈。一方面在豫章書院的轟炸式騷擾，騷擾到她的家人，她的學校。另一方面，也是家人的不理解，在各種壓力下，她患上了嚴重的抑鬱症。
這樣一個溫柔的女孩，一個正值青春年華的姑娘，一個真正的好人，選擇了自殺。
在經過醫院的艱難搶救下，她被救回來了。但與此同時，她的抑鬱症並沒有好轉，她還是覺得生活中的一切都沒有意義，也許活著還不如死去。在這種狀態下，子沐不可能再從事志願者的工作，就這樣，我們最溫柔的一位戰士，被豫章書院打垮了。我在這之後，真的非常愧疚，因為我是從事這個工作的，這些詆毀、攻擊對我來說都是家常便飯而已，我一天收到的辱罵，可能比普通人一年收到的還要多。
儘管有些時候，我也會受到這些辱罵、威脅的影響，但相對於其他人來說，這點影響微乎其微，這也是直到今日，我還能站在這裡的原因。我不得已的有了一顆大心臟，但不是所有人都能承受下來。
也許我就不該同意子沐來當志願者的，也許是我當時的一個疏忽，毀了她的一生。
但現在，已經來不及後悔了。我們只有戰鬥，只有不顧一切的戰鬥，只有不惜身負重傷的戰鬥，才能不讓子沐的痛苦變得毫無意義。我希望有一天，我可以當著她的面告訴她，你做的一切都是有意義的，你是我見過最好的好人。
受到迫害的志願者不止她一個。
另一個志願者，原本是在一家遊戲公司裡做策劃，業餘時間幫助受害學生們維權，他被找到了個人信息，被找到了他工作的公司，他公司就接到了無數個關於他的舉報電話，說他多管閒事，小心你們公司也一起遭殃，於是人事部就和他聯繫，告訴他被辭退了。一份大好的工作，就這樣沒了。
後來他和朋友合夥創業，在自己公司裡，在接到了舉報電話後，居然被自己的朋友表示，讓他在保留股份的情況下，退出自己的公司。
這就是我們所經歷的，也是我們那些熱血的志願者們，這兩年來的縮影。
我們在付出了這麼多，這麼慘重後，得到了什麼？
得到的是：
證據不足，證據不足，證據不足，無數個證據不足！
所有的案件都是證據不足，從豫章書院的大案件，到每個人的小案件，都是證據不足。哪怕我們有裡面的教官良心發現，做污點證人；哪怕我們有學生遭到毒打後的照片留存；哪怕有數百個，上千個受害學生在沒有事先溝通的情況下同時指證，他們做了這些事情；哪怕連央視都因為我們的努力播出三期節目，來講戒網癮的事情，豫章書院的事情。我們依然得到了一個證據不足的結果，證據永遠都是不足的。
其中一個受害同學，在2017年12月的時候，就得到了這個「證據不足，請繼續補充調查」的結果。當時想著不給他們添麻煩，就沒有說出來，耐心等候進一步的新進展。
但過去兩年了，我不知道這等得夠不夠久，我不知道兩年沒有任何新進展，是不是代表著這件事情就無限期擱置了。
我只知道，沒有一位豫章書院的負責人，得到了應有的懲罰。
我明白，在受害學生和警察們溝通的時候，他們非常負責，也非常想要幫助這些學生，想要豫章書院的惡人受到懲罰。可能在司法層面上，真的是證據不足，現有的證據不足以逮捕他們，不足以把他們送上法庭。
我只是很悲傷，豫章書院的「山長」們，他們拿著過去從受害學生們身上賺到的錢，依然瀟瀟灑灑，瀟灑到這兩年來，不間斷地報復我們的程度。他們沒一點事情，只是關掉了學校，甚至連罰款都沒有。我們的這些滿腔正義，沒做任何虧心事的志願者們，被各種騷擾，被公司辭退，被家人辱罵，被身邊的所有人質疑，被逼到抑鬱症自殺。
他們在報復我們啊，我們在生活裡已經四面楚歌。
隨著這個世界的關注一點點消退，我們就越來越危險，他們就越來越肆無忌憚，我不知道接下來，還會被怎樣的報復。他們有權有勢，還家財萬貫，我們一無所有，在他們面前我們弱小得就像一個不到十歲的孩子。這並非沒有先例的，全世界歷史上，有無數個死於非命的正義之士們，有無數個被迫害的記者們。
去年，全球有52個記者死於非命，這還僅僅是被發現的。這就是一條荊棘之路，這就是一顆雞蛋，視死如歸去撼動牆壁，大概率會遇到的宿命。但明知這樣，我們為什麼要這樣做？原因也許有一個：
我們一路奮戰，不是為了改變世界，而是為了不讓世界改變我們。
我們的訴求很簡單，也很卑微，希望相關部門能夠重啟對豫章書院及其相關負責人的調查，另外，希望吳軍豹他們，能夠停止對我身邊那些志願者的迫害，停止對當初站出來的受害學生的迫害。
但在這兩年裡，我們發現僅靠我們自己，是做不到這些的。
我們已經孤立無援了，所以希望得到你們的幫助，我們只能請求你們的幫助，我們希望你們能夠幫幫我們。
給這篇文章點讚，轉發這篇文章，傳播給更多人看到，並持續關注這次事件的後續資訊和文章，就是對我們最好的幫助。
溫柔在這裡，代表子沐，代表所有勇於站出來的受害學生，代表所有投身在豫章書院事件裡的志願者，多謝諸位了。
「曾經也有人勸我，不必做這件事情。」
「當你選擇曝光一個充滿著污穢的行業，往往就代表著，你在將自己置身於危險之中。」
「但我已經做好身負重傷的準備了，而這正是我的選擇。」
（完）
另外，因為暴走大事件的那次風波，讓B站的小夥伴不是很清楚這件事情。
作為第一當事人，我還是來說一下當時的時間線吧。
以下從兩年前，也就是2017年，豫章書院在網絡上還是一片讚揚說起。
作為豫章書院的受害人，周同學在從豫章書院逃出來後，一直在努力想要告訴世人豫章書院的真相，但是他在貼吧發的貼被百度刪掉，嘗試了各種渠道都失敗了，並且在2017年7月的時候，他說的真話，還被以「造謠誹謗」的名義立案調查。
10月16日， 在各種碰壁後，周同學懸在在知乎上私信我，後來加了qq，他就在那上面講述了他在豫章書院的經歷，我也決定盡我所能的幫助他。
10月16日~10月26日，這十天裡，我查閱了許多關於「戒網癮學校」的資料、新聞，還有這些年對楊永信的報導，我也在這段時間裡，和因為三星爆炸案，一直與三星對抗的「不老的老回」討論過這件事情，他向我推薦了一位記者朋友。
10月26日，我在自己的專欄發出了「中國到底有多少楊永信？」這篇文章，在11點的時候，文章約2k贊的時候，豫章書院某「信息部」的老師，把文章的鏈接發給了吳軍豹山長，12點左右，吳軍豹本人的知乎帳號，開始出沒在文章下方的評論區。他後來私信我，說要給我提供證據，想讓我刪文章，他加了我微信，並且聊了一下午。
在這過程中，豫章書院的官方網站關閉，他接到了四通撇清關係的電話（有聊天記錄作證，他本人也在我的質問中，承認了很多事情）。
10月27日，南昌青山湖官方宣布調查豫章書院。
10月28日，另一名當事學生@姍尼瑪大王丶在微博上講出了自己的經歷，引起了比較大的反響，與此同時，也有黑客凱文等微博大V開始關注這件事情，在當天早上，我發了在和戒網癮學校的吳軍豹校長對話後。這篇文章，接下來不久，轉發我文章的微博被限評，我的兩篇文章也被限評（未刪），至今仍然在關閉狀態。
同時豫章書院方花錢請了大V來幫他們洗白，但是被我在洗白文裡抓到了漏洞，直接戳穿那位大V被收買一事，導致她幾天之內掉了近十萬粉絲。具體是怎麼抓到漏洞的，可以去看我「吳軍豹，你就算找大V也翻不了盤的」一文，裡面有詳細論證。
在這個時間點，媒體正在採訪我和志願者們聯絡來的上百名受害學生，那段時間我和他們是不眠不休，整理上百名受害學生的爆料，同時與記者接洽，幫助記者聯繫到他們感興趣的受害學生，還要防範偽裝成受害學生的豫章書院方臥底。
最開始是我在做，後來因為有一次三天三夜都沒有休息，實在撐不住了，再加上一個人的精力有限，就有很多志願者加入，幫助我來整理，最開始是子沐和浩然，然後加入了更多的人，才把我解放出來。
10月30日，南昌青山湖的調查結果出來了，我對這個結果不是很滿意，於是寫了請南昌青山湖就「豫章書院」一事重新進行調查一文，要求他們不要「擠牙膏式」調查。
並且在前一天，我之前發的所有關於豫章書院的文章都遭到了舉報，當時我建議知乎官方先撐幾日，因為當時已經有多家權威媒體正在暗訪，比如說央視，唯一可惜的是南昌青山湖官方至今沒有重啟調查。
媒體也開始陸續的報導了，尤其是新京報，採訪到多位當事學生、教官、工作人員，並且拍成視頻。
這是第一次有媒體報導這件事情，之前都是我的文章在支撐熱度和持續曝光。
大概在這個時間點，《暴走大事件》的一位編劇聯繫到我，表示想要做一期這樣的節目，我同意配合，也就是後面《暴走大事件》豫章書院的那期節目。
11月3日晚，CCTV13的《新聞1+1》報導了豫章書院：《新聞1+1》 20171103 「問題少年」怎能交給「問題學校」？
11月5日，豫章書院開放日，新京報在騰訊新聞直播了當天的過程，無數家長（後被證實裡面鬧得最歡的，要麼是投股，要麼是請來的托，要麼是豫章自己的工作人員）拉橫幅表示支持學校繼續辦學，支持學校渡過難關：
11月8日，在我發出《中國到底有多少個楊永信？》一文的十二天後，原本正常開業，無任何倒閉跡象的豫章書院，關門了。
11月11日（這個日期我記得不是很清楚了），《暴走大事件》播出豫章書院的那期節目。
12月7日，在多位受害者聯合前往南昌報案多天後，豫章書院被立案調查。
同月，其中一位報警的受害學生（羅偉）得到回覆，由於證據不足，無法逮捕，請警方補充調查。
在這之中，無論是央視的報導，還是《暴走大事件》的節目，都沒有提到志願者們和我的名字與努力。也就導致了一些朋友，認為《暴走大事件》搶了我們的功勞，讓自己成為英雄。但我們對此並沒有任何計較，這兩年以來我們都沒有提過這件事情，反而很欣喜他們幫助受害學生們擴大了影響力。
但為什麼我現在又舊事重提，斤斤計較地強調這一點？
因為我和志願者們，還有勇敢站出來的受害學生，後來變成志願者幫助我們的，是直接接觸受害學生，直接與豫章書院和吳軍豹他們勢力對抗的人。我們是傷他們最深的利刃，當時絕大多數關鍵性證據，都是在我們的努力下，從吳軍豹的心窩子裡鑿出來的。
就像那唯一一張留存下來的被暴打後的照片，是我和子沐他們連夜與身在國外的這位女生，費盡心思多番溝通，再加上她自己也非常配合，讓她願意把這張有些隱私的照片公之於眾。
這也就導致了，吳軍豹恨我們入骨，再加上他一直沒有被逮捕入獄，就導致了他報復起我們來，太簡單也太輕易了。
我還好一些，本身就有一些名氣，他不敢輕易地對我動手，但他一直在蒐集我的信息，準備等事情完全過去後搞我。我的那些志願者們，他們沒有任何勢力，有些還只是在校學生，也就導致了吳軍豹可以對她們肆無忌憚的報復，各種騷擾，吳軍豹自己就在監獄外親自指揮這件事情。
就像在這之中做出貢獻非常大的子沐同學，被報復到自殺，你們也沒有一個人知道，沒有任何輿論能給她支持。這一刻我才發現，之前我和志願者們太天真了，我們以為「淡泊名利」是對的，哪怕讓別人做了英雄，只要對這件事情有益，就是好的。
但與此同時，我讓那些可愛的志願者們丟掉了他們唯一的保護傘，就是讓大眾知道，他們在擔著多大的風險做這件事情，他們付出了哪些努力，他們是最有可能會被吳軍豹報復的人。
央視不會被吳軍豹報復，《暴走大事件》不會被吳軍豹報復，新京報不會被吳軍豹報復 。
但我們會。
只有我們會被吳軍豹挖空心思地刺探真實信息，然後通過這些真實信息，騷擾，轟炸，甚至是找上門來。如果你們都知道我們做了這些事情，從他們開始打第一個騷擾電話，就能讓社會的目光重新聚到吳軍豹身上，他絕不敢做這種過分的事情，也不會有子沐不堪壓力到自殺，她的父親也不會覺得她一無是處，給她那麼大的壓力，反而會以她為榮。
曝光地溝油的河南記者李翔，在事情冷卻後，被那些他曝光的惡人們，在凌晨一點埋伏到他單位後門，刺了他十幾刀，李翔不治身亡。
我不想讓這樣的事情發生到我身上，也不想讓這樣的事情發生到我那些可愛的志願者身上，也不想讓子沐的遭遇重演，現在還在堅持的幾個志願者，在騷擾和現實的壓力下，精神都接近崩潰。
我讓他們去看心理醫生，然後告訴他們，把這些事情全交給我，讓你們遭遇這樣的事情，真的很對不起，我會讓事情變好起來的，我會讓這一團糟的現狀好起來的，請你們相信我。就像當初的周同學，不顧一切把所有事情都告訴我，然後我告訴他，我會幫助你的，我會盡我所能幫助你的。
於是他就相信了我，於是才有了後面的事情。
但若是讓我說真話，無論是當時，還是現在，我都很迷茫，很惶恐。因為我並不是什麼大人物，也不是什麼很厲害的人，我只是一個會寫點東西的普通人，區區幾萬粉絲在偌大的互聯網上連個水花都掀不起來，我不知道我能不能讓事情真的變好起來，我不知道自己會不會辜負他們的期待。但我只能這樣說，因為當時與現在，我都是他們唯一的希望。
我除了這杆筆以外，一無所有。
但我必須用這杆筆，掀翻這死氣沉沉、毫無希望、能把人拖入抑鬱症的無望現實。
因為我曾經成功過。
因為我必須這樣做。

Because of the exposure of Yuzhang College, my friend was retaliated to suicide.

04 Nov 2019, 06:17

[New Tang Dynasty Beijing time, November 04, 2019] Editor's note: The online news section is a voice platform provided to the majority of netizens. Welcome readers and friends to contribute. Due to conditions, the editorial department cannot verify the specific circumstances of all relevant events, please readers for understanding.
NTDTV received comments from netizens today. The full text is as follows:
When you choose to expose a polluting industry, it often means that you put yourself in danger. This was two years ago, I chose to stand up. Before I exposed Yuzhang College, I understood the truth. At that time, after considering it for a week, I chose to fight with a determination to be seriously injured.
But after all, the world is unpredictable. What I didn't expect was that the people who were eventually retaliated into the abyss were friends around me.
Some of them were dismissed by the company, and some chose to commit suicide.
But we have paid so much, and what did we finally get?
At that time, I issued ""How many Yang Yongxin did China have?"" After that, it caused the attention of the whole society. Many victims who had had tragic memories bravely stood up and helped us to puncture the masks of the ""mountain growers"" of the Yuzhang Jie Internet Addiction College. There are also many lovely volunteers who have invested in this cause. Spend a lot of time and energy to help those victims defend their rights.
At that time, I was threatened by them to abandon one of my hands, probably let me never write an article.
As for the volunteers, since the beginning of the incident, the ""Wu Junbaos"" of Yuzhang Academy have been spying on our information in various ways, including but not limited to pretending to be victims, sneaking into our convenient victims and journalists. Communicate the WeChat group, let the hacker black volunteer's computer track the volunteers who traveled to Nanchang...
In one of our investigations, I was surprised to find that Wu Junbao’s own trumpet was in the group of students who were victimized by our Yuzhang Academy. At that time, we talked about all the itineraries in that group, all in the eyes of Wu Junbao. .
Fortunately, we made two preparations, and we will review the information of the victims. We also built 2 groups, 3 groups, core groups, etc., and let them enter different groups according to the reliability. The 1 group is the group that communicates to all the affected students. Therefore, Wu Junbao can sneak in.
Here, I apologize to the victims of the 1 group. We don’t want to guard against you. They just spy on us in various ways and prepare to retaliate. We paid a heavy price and had to do so. . But despite the preparations, I was caught in the dilemma of personal information being exposed.
One of the people posing as a victim, plus one of our volunteers, asked about ""How old are you"", ""Where are you from?"", ""Where are you going to school?"", ""Can I add friends from other volunteers?"" On the other hand, when a volunteer chats with a fake student, he says that he has very important evidence. Then he sends a document and he clicks in and finds his computer. I was not controlled by myself. When I was operating on my own, he also knew some computers and knew that his computer was hacked, so he immediately pulled out the power.
One of the volunteers’ QQ number was stolen. That was our main communication account on QQ. Later, the IP of the QQ number was found, which was from Nanchang, Jiangxi (the seat of Yuzhang College).
The official account of our Weibo Rights Protection Association was bombarded, and now even the names have been eliminated, leaving only a bunch of numbers:
The person who reported them is Mr. Wu. You don’t have to think about it, it’s Wu Junbao (Yuzhang Shuyuan Shanchang).
One of the volunteers is a girl, a very gentle and enthusiastic girl. I believe that the reporters and victims who participated in this matter know her. Her name in the net is called ""Zi Mu"". She goes from beginning to end. They are all striving to fight for this matter. From the establishment of rights protection meetings to the contact with students and journalists, they have spent countless energy to help these children. And for security reasons, I did not choose to expose them to the public. She is a real good person who does not ask for a return.
But this girl, the information was dug up by Yuzhang College, from real names, to mobile phones, to home addresses, and even to the university, nothing was spared.
In a self-study class, she was called out by the counselor and asked if she was involved in any ""illegal organization."" She did not tell the people around her, even the close classmates did not say. There is only one possibility. It is the person of Yuzhang Academy, who harassed her school and said that she is a girl who fights for justice and participated in what is illegal. Her father has repeatedly threatened her. She dropped out of school.
People's energy is also limited, because it takes a lot of energy to help the children of Yuzhang Academy, and her performance has also plummeted. On the one hand, the bombing harassment in Yuzhang Academy, harassed her family, her school. On the other hand, it is also the family's incomprehension. Under various pressures, she suffers from severe depression.
Such a gentle girl, a girl who is a youth, a real good man, chose to commit suicide.
She was rescued after a difficult rescue by the hospital. But at the same time, her depression did not improve, she still felt that everything in life is meaningless, maybe it is better to die if she is alive. In this state, Zimu could no longer work as a volunteer. In this way, one of our gentlest warriors was beaten by Yuzhang College. After I am here, I am really embarrassed because I am engaged in this work. These defamation and attacks are commonplace for me. I have received more insults in one day than the average person receives in a year. .
Although there are times when I am affected by these insults and threats, this influence is minimal compared to others, and this is why I can still stand here until today. I have to have a big heart, but not everyone can afford it.
Maybe I shouldn't agree with Zimu as a volunteer, maybe it was a negligence at that time that ruined her life.
But now, it’s too late to regret it. We only have to fight, only fighting in desperation, only to fight with serious injuries, can not let the pain of the child become meaningless. I hope that one day, I can tell her in front of her, everything you do is meaningful, you are the best person I have ever seen.
The persecuted volunteers are more than one.
Another volunteer, originally planning in a game company, helped the victims in their spare time to defend their rights. He was found to have personal information, was found the company he worked for, and his company received numerous reports on him. He said that he was nosy, and that your company was also suffering, so the personnel department contacted him and told him to be dismissed. A good job, that's it.
Later, he and his friends started a partnership. In their own company, after receiving a report call, they were actually told by their friends that he would withdraw from his company while retaining shares.
This is what we have experienced, and it is also the epitome of our passionate volunteers over the past two years.
What have we got after we have paid so much and are so heavy?
The result is:
Insufficient evidence, insufficient evidence, insufficient evidence, and innumerable evidence!
All the cases are insufficiently evidenced. From the large case of Yuzhang Academy to the small case of everyone, there is insufficient evidence. Even if we have the conscience of the instructors found inside, we will be tainted witnesses; even if we have students who have been beaten, the photos will remain; even if there are hundreds, thousands of victims will testify without prior communication, they did these Things; even if CCTV is broadcasting three episodes because of our efforts, it is a matter of refusing Internet addiction, Yuzhang Academy. We still get a lack of evidence, and the evidence is always insufficient.
One of the victims, in December 2017, got the result of ""there is insufficient evidence, please continue to add the survey."" At that time, thinking about not giving them trouble, they did not say it, and patiently waited for further new progress.
But in the past two years, I don't know if this is enough for a long time. I don't know that there has been no new progress in the past two years. Is it a matter of standing on hold indefinitely?
I only know that no person in charge of the Yuzhang Academy has received the punishment it deserves.
I understand that when the students and the police are communicating, they are very responsible and very much want to help these students. They want the wicked people in Yuzhang College to be punished. At the judicial level, it is really insufficient evidence, and the existing evidence is not enough to arrest them, enough to bring them to court.
I am just very sad. The ""mountain growers"" of the Yuzhang Academy, who took the money they have earned from the victims, are still sloppy and sneak in the past two years and retaliate relentlessly. They didn't have anything, just turned off the school and didn't even have a fine. Our volunteers who were full of justice and did not do anything wrong, were harassed by various companies, dismissed by the company, insulted by their families, questioned by everyone around them, and forced to commit suicide by depression.
They are retaliating against us, we are already besieged in life.
As the world's attention fades a little bit, we are getting more and more dangerous, and they are becoming more and more unscrupulous. I don't know how to retaliate. They have the power and power, and they have a wealth of money. We have nothing. In front of them we are as weak as a child under ten. This is not without precedent. There are countless death-minded justices in the history of the world, and there are countless journalists who have been persecuted.
Last year, 52 journalists around the world died, which was only discovered. This is a road of thorns, this is an egg, as if you are dying to sway the wall, the fate you will encounter with a high probability. But knowing this, why do we want to do this? There may be one reason:
We fight all the way, not to change the world, but to prevent the world from changing us.
Our appeal is very simple and humble. I hope that the relevant departments can restart the investigation of the Yuzhang Academy and its related leaders. In addition, I hope that Wu Junbao, they can stop the persecution of the volunteers around me and stop standing up. Persecution of the victimized student.
But in the past two years, we have found that we can't do this alone.
We have been isolated and helpless, so I hope to get your help, we can only ask for your help, we hope that you can help us.
Like this article, forward this article, spread it to more people to see, and continue to follow the follow-up information and articles of this incident, is the best help for us.
Gentle here, on behalf of Zi Mu, represents all the victims who dare to stand up and represent all the volunteers who participated in the Yuzhang Academy incident. Thank you.
""I was once advised that I don't have to do this.""
""When you choose to expose a polluting industry, it often means that you are putting yourself at risk.""
""But I am ready to be seriously injured, and this is my choice.""
(Finish)
In addition, because of the storm of the big event, the small partner of Station B is not very clear about this matter.
As the first party, let me talk about the timeline at the time.
The following two years ago, that is, in 2017, Yuzhang Academy was still praised on the Internet.
As a victim of the Yuzhang Academy, after escaping from the Yuzhang Academy, Zhou’s classmates have been trying to tell the truth about the Yuzhang Academy, but the stickers he posted in the post were deleted by Baidu and tried various channels. It failed, and in July 2017, the truth he said was also investigated in the name of ""achievement.""
On October 16th, after all kinds of encounters, Zhou’s classmates hung in the knowledge of me, and later added qq, he told him about his experience in Yuzhang Academy, and I decided to do my best to help. he.
From October 16th to October 26th, during the ten days, I checked a lot of information about the ""Internet addiction school"", news, and reports on Yang Yongxin in these years. I also spent this time, and because In the Samsung bombing case, the ""old old back"" that has been fighting against Samsung has discussed this matter. He recommended a reporter friend to me.
On October 26, I sent out in my column, ""How many Yang Yongxin is there in China?"" At 11 o'clock, when the article was about 2k, the teacher of an ""information department"" of Yuzhang College put the article. The link was sent to Wu Junbao Shanchang, around 12 o'clock, Wu Junbao himself knows the account, began to appear in the comment area below the article. He later privately believed me, saying that he would provide me with evidence and wanted me to delete the article. He added me to WeChat and talked for an afternoon.
In the process, the official website of Yuzhang College was closed. He received a phone call from the four-way confession relationship (there was a chat record to testify, and he himself also admitted a lot of things in my questioning).
On October 27, Nanchang Qingshan Lake officially announced the investigation of Yuzhang College.
On October 28th, another student, @姗尼玛大王丶, spoke his own experience on Weibo, causing a relatively large response. At the same time, there were also hackers Kevin and other microblogging big V began to pay attention to this. In the morning, I sent a conversation with the headmaster Wu Junbao of the Internet Addiction School. This article, shortly after, the microblog that forwarded my article was limited, and my two articles were also limited (not deleted) and are still closed.
At the same time, Yuzhang Academy spent a lot of money to help them wash the white, but I caught a loophole in the whitewashed article and directly poked the big V to be bought, causing her to lose nearly 100,000 fans within a few days. . Specifically, how to catch the loopholes, you can go to see me ""Wu Junbao, you can not turn the disk if you find a big V"", there are detailed arguments.
At this point in time, the media is interviewing hundreds of victims who have contacted me and volunteers. During that time, I and I were not sleeping, sorting out the contents of hundreds of victims, and contacting reporters to help reporters feel their feelings. Students who are victims of interest must also guard against the undercover of the Yuzhang Academy, which is disguised as a victim.
At the beginning, I was doing it. Later, because I didn’t have a rest for three days and three nights, I couldn’t hold it anymore. Coupled with the limited energy of a person, many volunteers joined me to help me sort out. And Hao Ran, then joined more people before I liberated me.
On October 30, the survey results of Qingshan Lake in Nanchang came out. I was not very satisfied with this result. I wrote a paper asking Nanshan Qingshan Lake to re-investigate the ""Yuzhang Academy"" and asked them not to ""squeeze toothpaste"" investigation. .
And the day before, all the articles I sent about Yuzhang College were reported. At that time, I suggested that the official first stay for a few days, because there were already many authoritative media in the past, such as CCTV, the only pity. It is the official of Qingshan Lake in Nanchang that has not restarted the investigation so far.
The media also began to report one after another, especially the Beijing News, interviewing a number of students, instructors, staff, and making a video.
This is the first time that there has been media coverage of this matter. Previously, my article was supporting the heat and continuing exposure.
At this point in time, a screenwriter of ""The Big Bang"" contacted me and said that I wanted to do a program like this. I agreed to cooperate, that is, the program of the Yuzhang Academy, which was followed by the ""Big Walking"".
On the evening of November 3, CCTV13's ""News 1+1"" reported on Yuzhang Academy: ""News 1+1"" 20171103 How can ""problem teenagers"" be handed over to ""problem schools""?
On November 5th, the opening day of the Yuzhang Academy, the Beijing News broadcasted the day's process in Tencent News, countless parents (after being confirmed that the most happily inside, either the stock market, or the invitation, or Yuzhang’s own staff) pulled the banner to support the school to continue school and support the school to tide over the difficulties:
On November 8, I issued ""How many Yang Yongxin are there in China?"" Twelve days after the article, the Yuzhang Academy, which was originally opened for business and showed no signs of bankruptcy, was closed.
On November 11th (I don't remember this date very clearly), ""The Big Bang"" broadcast the program of Yuzhang College.
On December 7, after several victims jointly sent to Nanchang to report the case, Yuzhang College was investigated.
In the same month, one of the victims of the police (Luo Wei) was replied. Due to insufficient evidence, he was unable to arrest. The police were asked to fill the investigation.
Among them, neither the CCTV report nor the program of ""The Big Bang"" did not mention the volunteers and my name and efforts. It also led to some friends who thought that ""The Big Bang"" robbed us of our credit and made ourselves a hero. But we have nothing to do with it. We have not mentioned this matter in the past two years. Instead, we are very pleased that they have helped the affected students to expand their influence.
But why do I revisit the old things now and stress this point?
Because I and the volunteers, as well as the victimized students who bravely stood up, and later became volunteers to help us, they were directly in contact with the victimized students and directly confronted the forces of Yuzhang Academy and Wu Junbao. We are the most cutting edge of their wounds. At that time, most of the key evidence was carved out from the heart of Wu Junbao under our efforts.
Like the only photo that was saved after being beaten, it was the girl who spent the night with me and her, and she had a lot of communication, and she also cooperated with her. Let her Willing to make this private photo public.
This led to the fact that Wu Junbao hated us, and he had not been arrested and imprisoned, which led him to retaliate against us, too simple and too easy.
I am still better. I have some fame. I dare not do it to me easily, but he has been collecting my information and is ready to engage me when things are completely over. My volunteers, they have no power, and some are only students at school. This has led Wu Junbao to retaliate against them. All kinds of harassment, Wu Junbao himself personally directs this matter outside the prison.
Just like the sub-classmate who made a great contribution among them, he was retaliated to commit suicide. No one knows that no public opinion can support her. At this moment, I discovered that I and the volunteers were too naive. We thought that ""indifferent to fame and fortune"" was right. Even if others were to be heroes, as long as they were good for this matter, it would be good.
But at the same time, I let those lovely volunteers lose their only umbrella, that is, let the public know how much risk they are doing and what efforts they have made, they are most likely to be Wu Junbao revenge.
CCTV will not be retaliated by Wu Junbao. The ""Big Walking"" will not be retaliated by Wu Junbao, and the Beijing News will not be retaliated by Wu Junbao.
But we will.
Only we will be sneaked into the real information by Wu Junbao, and then through these real information, harassment, bombing, and even come to the door. If you all know that we have done these things, from the beginning of their first harassment call, we can refocus the society on Wu Junbao. He will never dare to do such excessive things, and there will be no sub-mu. Unbearable pressure to commit suicide, her father would not think that she was useless, giving her so much pressure, but would be proud of her.
Li Xiang, a Henan reporter who exposed the waste oil, was ambushed by the evil people he exposed when he was cold, to the back door of his unit at one o'clock in the morning, stabbing him a dozen or so knives, and Li Xiang died.
I don't want to let such things happen to me, I don't want to let such things happen to my lovely volunteers, and I don't want to repeat the experience of Zimu. Now I still insist on a few volunteers, in harassment and reality. Under the pressure, the spirit is close to collapse.
I asked them to go to the psychiatrist, and then told them to hand over all these things to me and let you encounter such a thing. I am really sorry, I will make things better, I will make this messy situation better. Please believe me. Just like the classmate of Zhou, I told everyone everything, and then I told him that I would help you. I will do my best to help you.
So he believed me, so he had the latter thing.
But if I let the truth, whether at the time or now, I am very confused and very scared. Because I am not a big man, not a very powerful person, I am just an ordinary person who can write something. The tens of thousands of fans in the district can’t even get a splash on the big Internet. I don’t know if I can let Things really get better, I don't know if I will live up to their expectations. But I can only say this because I was their only hope at the time and now.
I have nothing but this pen.
But I must use this pen to smash the hopeless reality of being dead, hopeless, and dragging people into depression.
Because I have been successful.
Because I have to do this.
