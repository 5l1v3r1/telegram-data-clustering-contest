      <p>SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old Indian worker was killed and a Bangladeshi worker injured after a crane collapsed on Monday (Nov 4) at the construction site of a new rehab facility under Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p>
      <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it received a call for help at a construction site in Jalan Tan Tock Seng in Novena at about 8.50am.</p>

      <p>Another man, aged 35, was taken conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital after the incident, the police said.</p>
      <p>Police investigations are ongoing, they added.</p>
      <p>When CNA's reporter arrived at the scene, part of the tower crane – roughly the height of a 10-storey building – had collapsed and was bent at an angle.</p>

      <p>In response to CNA's queries, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said: "The jib of a tower crane failed during a lifting operation, killing a 28-year-old Indian national and injuring another 35-year-old Bangladeshi national at the worksite."</p>
      <p>A jib is an operating arm that extends horizontally from the crane.</p>
      <p>LKT Contractors is the employer of the deceased worker, while BHCC Construction is the employer of the injured worker, said MOM.</p>
      <p>The developer of the project is MOH Holdings and the occupier is Kajima Overseas Asia (Singapore), the ministry added.</p>
      <p>"MOM is investigating the incident," a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WORK HALTED AT SITE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Work has been halted at the site, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement later on Monday, adding that it was working with the contractor and MOM to investigate the cause of the incident.</p>
      <p>The ministry also said it was working with Kajima Overseas Asia (Singapore) to assist the deceased worker’s family and to the injured worker.</p>
      <p>"We are deeply saddened that one worker has died and another worker was injured from the incident," MOH said.</p>
      <p>"Safety at our worksites is of utmost importance. We take a serious view of this incident."</p>

      <p>The worksite is the location of <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-ttsh-rehabilitation-complex-to-open-in-2022-8572786">a new Integrated Care Hub by Tan</a><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-ttsh-rehabilitation-complex-to-open-in-2022-8572786"> Tock Seng Hospital</a>. The 17-storey development will house a 500-bed rehabilitative facility when completed. </p>
      <p>The hub, which is expected to open in 2022, will be part of the 17-hectare HealthCity Novena, slated to be Singapore’s largest healthcare complex.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's note: The Ministry of Manpower has advised that the injured worker is a Bangladeshi and not an Indian national as it said initially. </i>
        <i>It has also corrected the name of the company to BHCC Construction.</i>
