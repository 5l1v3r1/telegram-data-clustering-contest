      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – A petition seeking arrest of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has been filed in Lahore High Court (LHC) today (Monday).<br/><br/>According to the plea, JUI-F chairman is inciting the people against incumbent government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan during his Azadi March. Maulana’s speeches can spark anarchy among the people, the petition added. <br/><br/>It further said that provoking masses against the government comes under rebellion and requested the court to issue directives to detain Maulana Fazlur Rehman.  </p>
      <p>On the other hand, JUI-F has convened All Parties Conference (APC) to meet today at his residence to formulate future strategy for the Azadi March.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will not attend the APC as he is scheduled to address a public rally in Bahawalpur, however, will be represented in the APC by senior PPP leaders.</p>
      <p>Leadership of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), Qaumi Watan Party (QWP), Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP) and Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadees will attend the All Parties Conference.</p>
      <p>Earlier, while addressing the gathering of Azadi March, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said today only one city is locked and in future entire country can be locked.</p>
      <p>"They are asking us to go and file complaints with the election commission which even more helpless than us," he added.</p>
