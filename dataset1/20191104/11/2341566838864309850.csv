報告指出，美國對印太區域的願景與策略方法，與許多區域夥伴的相關政策緊密結合，其中包含台灣的新南向政策。美方也努力強化、深化與台灣關係，並針對北京透過軍演、經濟壓力、限縮國際空間及奪取邦交國等霸凌台灣行徑，多次表達關切。
報告強調：「這些行徑破壞台海兩岸受惠數十年的現狀。」
針對台灣國防能力，國務院報告表示，依據台灣關係法，美國支持台灣擁有有效嚇阻能力，川普政府今年批准並通知美國國會，總價超過100億美元的可能對台軍售案。
報告也指出，為了迎接全球數位連結所帶來的挑戰，美國推廣開放、交互運作、安全及可信賴的網絡，並與包含澳洲、日本及台灣等多個理念相近夥伴合作，支持此一目標。在促進良善治理方面，美國則與澳洲、紐西蘭、日本及台灣等地，在治理優先事項上發展夥伴關係。
國務院報告在總結部分表示，美國跨黨派國會議員對印太政策的支持，是促使美國在政策投資的一大驅動因素。
報告指出，美國國會對印太的支持，從2018年10月及同年12月所通過的「善用投資導引開發法」（BUILD Act）及「亞洲再保證倡議法案」（Asia Reassurance Initiative Act）可見一斑。報告也表示，透過立法努力，美國國會展現美方對台灣國防及國際空間的承諾。（編輯:陳惠珍）1081104
