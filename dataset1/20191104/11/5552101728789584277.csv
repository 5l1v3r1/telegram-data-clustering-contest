【Arran威士忌的斜槓思維2】經典花果香氣　都來自這些隱藏的細節
04 Nov 2019, 11:04 by 林亦君, 何宗昇
以前聽威士忌女王Julie或Arran大中華區品牌大使Ellis做威士忌風味品鑒，提到Arran時，總會說花果香氣是它的經典風味。這次來到艾倫島上，首席調酒師James Mac Taggart毫不藏私地帶我們從麥芽處理、發酵，一路看到蒸餾過程，才知道Arran威士忌蘊含的花果香氣，原來是來自於這些細節。





位在艾倫島西北邊羅赫蘭札的Arran酒廠，被一片綠意包圍。

介紹完酒廠引以為豪的潔淨水源，James又帶我們走到蒸餾廠外，指著偌大機器解釋這裡一次可以處理2.5噸的大麥。他細細說明，這些發芽大麥進入碾麥機中，能得到20%的麥殼、65%粗顆粒、15%細粉，為了接下來進入糖化槽而準備，這些磨碎的麥粉是進行糖化的基礎，透過溶解轉換，獲得製造酒精所需的糖。


蒸餾廠外的兩座容器，裝著滿滿的麥芽。



碾麥機的重量必須經過精密計算與記錄，跟稅金息息相關。

我們進入蒸餾廠中，看到碾碎的麥芽通過管線被送進銅製的糖化槽（Wash Tun）裡，分幾次注入熱水，讓麥芽中的澱粉轉化成含醣的麥汁，總共2.5 噸的糖化槽，一次可以讓13,000公升的麥汁進行糖化，糖化槽的底部有加熱板來協助分離固體（麥渣）與液體，糖化後的液體就稱為Wort（麥汁）。
因為加熱過後溫度太高，而酵母是不耐熱的，所以必須冷卻到大約攝氏18度後才能進行發酵。麥汁在過濾之後，會轉移到15,000公升的大型發酵槽（Wash Back）中，Arran的發酵槽是用奧勒岡松木製作，加入酵母，便開始進行發酵。


蒸餾廠內有好幾個容量15,000公升、以奧勒岡松木製作的大型發酵槽。（Arran提供）

James說，發酵40小時後，能得到大約8%的酒精濃度，然後他們會再放置72到78小時，發酵時間越久，甜度會拉得越高，而這也是Arran威士忌會散發花果香氣的關鍵步驟所在。
發酵結束後，終於要開始進行蒸餾，這個蒸餾廠配置了兩對蒸餾器，第一次蒸餾後會得到酒精度約23%的初餾液（low wine），再經過一次精餾，就會得到酒精濃度高達74%的蒸餾液（High Wine）。


Arran的羅赫蘭扎廠目前擁有兩對蒸餾器，林恩臂的角度大約呈90度直角。

James帶我們來到「烈酒保險箱」（Spirit Safe）前面，告訴我們在第二次蒸餾之後，冷卻下來的酒液會來到烈酒保險箱，這時蒸餾師將酒體分成酒頭、酒心、酒尾三部分，二次蒸餾的前20分鐘不取酒，20分鐘後人工切換到取酒區，大約酒精度73%開始，到兩個半小時後，酒精度降到63.5%才會裝桶。這便是威士忌誕生的第一階段，接下來就要由橡木桶來發揮它的威力了。


10年、無年份與18年（由右至左）都是Arran的基本酒款，能品嘗到經典的花果香氣。

[Arran whisky slash thinking 2] classic floral aromas come from these hidden details
04 Nov 2019, 11:04 by Lin Yijun, He Zongsheng
I used to listen to whisky queen Julie or Arran Greater China brand ambassador Ellis for whisky tasting. When I mentioned Arran, I always said that the floral aroma is its classic flavor. This time on the island of Allen, the chief bartender James Mac Taggart did not hide from the malt we processed, fermented, all the way to see the distillation process, only to know that Arran whisky contains the aroma of flowers and fruits, originally from these details.





The Arran winery in Rohranza, northwest of Ellen Island, is surrounded by greenery.

Introducing the clean water source that the winery is proud of, James took us outside the distillation plant and pointed to the large machine to explain that it can handle 2.5 tons of barley at a time. He explained in detail that these germinated barley entered the rice milling machine and were able to obtain 20% wheat hulls, 65% coarse granules, and 15% fine powder. In order to proceed to the saccharification tank, these ground wheat flours were saccharified. The basis for obtaining the sugar needed to make alcohol through dissolution conversion.


The two containers outside the distillation plant are filled with malt.



The weight of the rice milling machine must be carefully calculated and recorded, and is closely related to taxes.

We entered the distillation plant and saw that the crushed malt was sent to the copper mashing tank (Wash Tun) through the pipeline, and the hot water was injected into the sugar-containing wort several times. The 2.5-ton saccharification tank allows 13,000 liters of wort to be saccharified at a time. The bottom of the saccharification tank has a heating plate to assist in the separation of solids (wheat) and liquid. The saccharified liquid is called Wort.
Since the temperature is too high after heating, and the yeast is not heat-resistant, it must be cooled to about 18 degrees Celsius before fermentation. After the wort is filtered, it is transferred to a 15,000 liter large Wash Back. The Arran's fermentation tank is made from Oregon pine and added to the yeast to start the fermentation.


The distillery has several large fermentation tanks with a capacity of 15,000 liters and made from Oregon pine. (provided by Arran)

James said that after 40 hours of fermentation, it can get about 8% alcohol concentration, and then they will be placed for another 72 to 78 hours. The longer the fermentation time, the higher the sweetness will be, and this is also the fragrance of Arran whisky. The key steps are there.
At the end of the fermentation, distillation is finally started. The distillation plant is equipped with two pairs of distillers. After the first distillation, a low wine of about 23% alcohol is obtained, and after a rectification, it is obtained. Distillate (High Wine) with an alcohol concentration of up to 74%.


Arran's Rohranza plant currently has two pairs of distillers, and the angle of the Lynn arm is approximately 90 degrees.

James took us to the front of the Spirit Safe and told us that after the second distillation, the cooled wine would come to the spirits safe, when the distiller divides the wine into the wine head, the wine heart, The three parts of the wine tail, the first 20 minutes of the second distillation, do not take the wine, after 20 minutes, manually switch to the wine-picking area, about 73% of the alcohol content begins, after two and a half hours, the alcohol level drops to 63.5% before the barrel . This is the first stage of the birth of whisky, and then it will be played by oak barrels.


10 years, no years and 18 years (from right to left) are the basic wines of Arran, which can taste the classic floral and fruit aroma.
