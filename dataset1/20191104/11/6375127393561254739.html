      <h3>CAMP BRIG. GEN. VICENTE LIM, CANLUBANG CITY, CALAMBA, LAGUNA – Joint police and military personnel on Saturday arrested two suspected terrorists in separate anti-terror operations in Tayabas City, Quezon and in Calamba City, Laguna.</h3>
      <p>Arrested in Tayabas City was Saidie Saro alias “Abu Hudaifa.”</p>
      <p>Saro was caught in Bgy. Angeles Zone 2 by virtue of a search warrant for violations of RA 10591 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Act and PD  1866 or Illegal Possession of Explosives.</p>
      <p>Seized from the suspect were a hand grenade, a live ammunition and an improvised explosive device (IED).</p>
      <p>In Calamba City, authorities arrested Bobby Gabunatan Sarip, who yielded an IED and a cellular phone.</p>
      <p>Sarip was nabbed in an operation in Bgy. Real.<br/>Police said  both suspects, who were alleged members of the Dawlah Islamiyah Terror Group, were found in possession of ISIS flags when arrested.</p>
      <p>The arrests were triggered by an information that ISIS members in the country are planning to sow terror during SEA Games events hosted by the Philippines, and are scheduled to start in late November.</p>
      <p>Some of the games will be held in various parts of Calabarzon region.</p>
