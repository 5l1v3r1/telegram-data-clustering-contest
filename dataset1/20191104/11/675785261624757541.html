      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:58:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/british-airways">British Airways</a> is giving holidaymakers the perfect opportunity to bag a cheap European city break in its latest sale.</p>
      <p>The airline has slashed prices across 200,000 seats on its London Gatwick routes, and there are currently fares from £24 each way up for grabs.</p>
      <p>There are heaps of tempting destinations including the likes of Amsterdam, Nice, Seville, Alicante, Venice, Rome and Dubrovnik included in the offer.</p>
      <p>All of the discounted flights are already available to book on the <a href="https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/offers/sale">British Airways website here</a> .</p>
      <p>However, if you find your ideal getaway in the offers then it's worth snapping it up, as the sale isn't on for long; it ends on Tuesday 5th November.</p>
      <p>Oh, and as there are 200,000 seats included, once they're gone, that's it. (As for the travel dates available, this varies depending on your destination but there are selected dates available from November 2019 through to March 2020).</p>
