      <p>MONTREAL – Power has been restored to the majority of Quebec homes after last week’s intense cocktail of rain and wind.</p>
      <p>Hydro-Quebec workers were on the ground throughout the weekend, with the help of teams from other provinces and the U.S., to bring electricity back to almost a million customers affected by the storm.</p>
      <p>"We have now about 50,000 people in Quebec without electricity out of 1 million that we had Friday in the morning," said Premier François Legault at the Monday morning news conference.</p>
      <p>As of 3 p.m. Monday, around 49,000 Quebec households were left without power. Most of those homes are in the Estrie and Centre-du-Quebec regions. In Montreal, just over 5900 homes remain in the dark.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of work done, but the rest of the work is not easy because instead of plugging in 100 or 200 people at a time, we're plugging in three or four people at a time. So, there's a lot of work to do," said Legault, adding that Hydro-Quebec is confident "most of these people" will regain electricity by Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Some 1,400 people are working to restore electricity to those still in the dark.</p>
      <p>“We understand that 48 hours without electricity is a long time, so we’ve been accelerating and I can assure you we are making all efforts to bring electricity to every home in Quebec,” said Eric Martel, Hydro-Quebec president and CEO, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The work remaining is a lot more complex. Very often it’s behind the homes, so we don’t have access with our trucks and we have to bring special equipment.”</p>
      <p>The Crown Corporation is reminding people not to approach power lines and to never use outdoor equipment, such as barbecues and generators, inside.</p>
