Omar Aqil writes: The reality of the local player

Is the Moroccan player in the light of what we live in the era of the professionalism of Moroccan football convinced of its artistic reality and its current market value and give it inside the green rectangle, and the extent of his discipline in eating, sleeping, training and dealing and treatment Has the Moroccan player reached a stage in which he resides without media application, public sympathy, and exaggeration of lovers? Often, his level is unpopular with the millions of dirhams that have put the clubs in a big financial predicament, and whether he offers large financial deals that are exaggerated during the summer and winter transfers from his father to the end of his career. To a subsequent competition, which confirms that the Moroccan player locally has not yet reached a level that puts itself in the box it deserves from the evaluation. Unfortunately what is achieved today The local player, by exaggerating the ceiling of the assignments, cannot be promoted by officials with an abyss mentality leading the football career towards actual professionalism, in the absence of the player's evaluation when contracting or renewing, and merging with the merger of the player. Need, age and expected delivery, provided that it is accompanied by a competent trainer with full powers and management that defines business boundaries. In terms of specialization, no president intervenes, no coach who comes in millions of dirhams and his role is to supervise the team's training only. The problem of Moroccan football with regard to the assignments of some of the clubs is one of the clubs. It gives the correct technical evaluation through a specialized and empowered team, so the Moroccan league arena in most of its deals has become a failed field of experience. Dozens of players move between clubs every season, carrying with them bags of penal conditions and leaving behind the technical and financial damages suffered by the club for a long period, and added to the subsequent contracts are signed and signed by the signing of the contract. If Moroccan football is to move forward, club administrations are entitled to specialization and planning on everything. The specific extent, superiority and achievements in the green rectangle, except that it is simply a move and rotation of the players quickly results are not similar to the results of any previous traditional work, the nature of what is going nowhere. Disbursement of their financial resources in a manner that includes smell of indecency, irresponsibility, and that this money in the hands is self-owned, not Each year should be accountable to the general public, which is essentially absent or absent from the basis of accurate accounting. The problems facing our clubs at the moment, which are known as the antiquities of coral reefs. Only those who are expected to be a blessing to their clubs, not a curse, let us look for the people of thought together with the experienced people to give them The birth of the clubs to safety.
