      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- The high school football playoffs start this week, and 15 Southwest Florida teams have a shot at a state championship.</p>
      <p><b>Class 7A:</b><br/>For the first time since 2004, Lehigh Acres will host a playoff game. The lightning will take on the Venice Indians this Friday at home.</p>
      <p><b>Class 6A:</b><br/>There are a lot of teams in our area fighting for a 6A state title. The biggest name is Naples, who went undefeated and got the top seed in their region. They'll host South Fort Myers.</p>
      <p>But the biggest match-up is likely North Fort Myers at Fort Myers. It'll be the second time in three years these heated rivals will play in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>Other teams playing Friday include Dunbar playing a game at Miami Central, and Lely play at Dillard in Fort Lauderdale. <br/>Charlotte County is also represented by Charlotte High, who head to Fort Pierce to play Westwood; and Port Charlotte, who visit Hillsborough High in Tampa.</p>
      <p><b>Class 5A:</b><br/>And how about Cypress Lake? Friday, they'll have their first playoff game since 1995! They'll host North Miami Beach.</p>
      <p><b>Class 4A:</b><br/>Lemon Bay travels to Tampa Catholic for a Class 4A matchup.</p>
      <p><b>Class 3A:</b><br/>Bishop Verot actually gets a bye week after going 8-2, and will play the winner of this weekâ€™s Cardinal Newman/Benjamin game.</p>
      <p><b>Class 2A: </b><br/>St. John Neumann Catholic in Naples hosts Miami Christian, and Moore Haven goes to Naples to play First Baptist.</p>
