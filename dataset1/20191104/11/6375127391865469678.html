      <h3>THE Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP) will  conduct six more “Serbisyo Caravans” in different areas all over the country before the end of year in addition to the 46 caravans that were initially set by the Commission.</h3>
      <p>Catering to thousands of people availing different services from the government through , PCUP chairman and CEO  Alvin S. Feliciano said the Commission will extend its helping hand through the best services it could provide to  needy areas especially the “poorest of the poor” communities.</p>
      <p>“Target namin ngayon ang mas malawak pa na hanay ng mga benipisyaryo ng mga libreng serbisyo mula sa pamahalaan kaya naman nagdagdag pa kami ng anim na PCUP caravan sa iba’t ibang panig ng bansa.</p>
      <p>“Mula 42, nasa 48 na caravan na ang aming maibababa sa iba’t ibang dako ng bansa bago matapos ang taon para talagang maibigay ang tulong ng gobyerno sa mga lugar na hirap maabot ng pamahalaan,” Feliciano said.</p>
      <p>PCUP caravan is one the three priority programs being pushed by the Commission along with the “Urban Poor Privilege Card” and “Adopt an Urban Poor Community” program to meet the basic needs of the marginalized groups and to alleviate poverty.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a total of 13 more caravans are set to be conducted in NCR, Luzon, Visayas, and even in Mindanao.  </p>
      <p>The first out of the six additional caravans was already held last October 23 at Remarville Tennis Court, Barangay Bagbag, Novaliches, Quezon City and served at least  2,000 residents.</p>
      <p>PCUP expects to have more poor communities that will be rendered services through the  “Serbisyo Caravan” to provide quality services from various government agencies and other partners from private sectors.</p>
