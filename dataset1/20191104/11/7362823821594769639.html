      <p>Week 9 of the 2019 NFL season brought along a first in league history.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> quarterback Kyle Allen, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> quarterback Brandon Allen and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a> all started games for their respective teams and they all won.</p>

      <p>The Panthers defeated the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a>, 30-20; the Broncos defeated the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> 24-19; and the Bills defeated the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a> 24-9.</p>
      <p>The wins mark the first time three quarterbacks with the same last name won on the same week.</p>

      <p>It was also the first time since 2000 that three quarterbacks with the same last name started a game when Brad Johnson of the Redskins, Doug Johnson of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> and Rob Johnson of the Bills did it, according to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/dpcy3f/with_brandon_josh_and_kyle_allen_all_starting/">Reddit sleuth</a>.</p>

      <p>The chances of this occurring couldnâ€™t have been slimmer.</p>
      <p>Kyle Allen has started in place of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cam-newton">Cam Newton</a> since Week 3 of the season. Newton has had foot issues and his status of returning this season does not look great. Allen has gone 5-1 this season.</p>
      <p>Brandon Allen was originally selected in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> but made his way to the Broncos in September. He made his first start Sunday and won in an upset over the Browns.</p>
