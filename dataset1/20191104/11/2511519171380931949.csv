A new Britney Spears documentary has revealed the reason why the singer shaved her head during her infamous breakdown in 2007.
Titled Britney Spears: Breaking Point, the Channel 5 documentary features several people from the singer’s life, including tattoo artist Emily Wynne-Hughes, who saw Spears moments after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers.
“[There was] an insane roaring sound outside,” Wynn-Hughed told interviewers about the moment, which occurred the evening after Spears left rehab in Tarzana, Los Angeles.
“I wasn’t sure what was happening, if there was a riot outside, and then the flashes came. The door opened slowly and a hooded figure walked in the door.’ 
She continued: “I noticed [Britney’s] hair was gone. I remember asking her, ‘Why did you shave your head?’ And her answer was a bit weird. It was, you know, ‘I just don’t want anybody touching my head. I don’t want anyone touching my hair. I’m sick of people touching my hair’.”
The same documentary claims that Spears’s bodyguards accepted bribes to give members of the media access to the singer. 
Hairdresser Esther Tognozzi, who was present in the salon when Spears shaved her head, said:  ‘She had two bodyguards, supposedly keeping an eye out to make sure the paparazzi were not getting any pictures and one of them kept opening the blinds.
Britney Spears: Breaking Point is available to stream on My5 now.
