Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan have recently completed twenty-eight years of marriage but the couple still manages to give other famous B-town couples like Priyanka Chopra-Nick Jonas, Anushka Sharma-Virat Kohli and others a tough competition.
Not only have the two stood by each other in good and bad but have been giving their fans major relationship goals with their impeccable chemistry.
While Gauri took to social media to share an adorable family picture; SRK reacted to it on Monday afternoon with a sweet message. He shared Gauri's post and wrote, ""Over years I made a good house...Gauri made a good Home but I really believe we are the best at making some really good kids!""



Looks like the Badshah of Bollywood is taken the millennial way of expressing his love on social media now as well. This family picture seems to be from their recent Europe trip and SRK-Gauri's kids: Suhana, AbRam and Aryan too look beautiful as they posed with their parents.
Meanwhile, on the professional front, SRK will be returning on the silver screen after a long break which he took to spend some quality time with his family. The 'Raees' actor also assured his fans that he has something special in the works currently and will have a film release in 2020.
