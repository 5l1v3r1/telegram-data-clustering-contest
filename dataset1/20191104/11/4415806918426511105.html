      <p>Shirley Ballas has said it has been an “emotional” week after having her breast implants removed, and that she was in pain while filming Strictly Come Dancing at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The TV judge took part in Saturday’s live show just four days after going under the knife.</p>
      <p>She said she decided to go back to work right away because she had made a commitment to the programme.</p>
      <p>Ballas, 59, told ITV’s Lorraine that, while she is in pain – and was during the live broadcast at the weekend – she is doing well, adding: “It’s definitely been an emotional week for sure.”</p>

      <p>On not missing the show following the surgery, she said: “I made a commitment to the show and I wanted to see it through. I made a decision to put them in (the implants) and I made the decision to take them out.”</p>
      <p>Ballas said it was painful, but that she “chose to take minimal painkillers”.</p>
      <p>“Every day it will get better. About 6-8 weeks’ recuperation. I won’t (miss a show).”</p>
      <p>During Saturday’s Strictly, head judge Ballas did not dance as she made her entrance, instead walking down the stairs holding on to the banister on her way to her seat.</p>
      <p>She eschewed her usual glamorous gowns for a black trouser suit with a white blouse and black bow at her neck.</p>
      <p>Ballas recently expressed her regret over having breast implants as she warned other women to think twice before going under the knife.</p>
      <p>She reportedly spent four-and-a-half hours on the operating table to have her breast augmentation reversed and a potentially dangerous capsule removed.</p>

      <p>Ballas decided to revert back to her natural A cup because of health concerns and finally being able to accept her natural body after being told by a healthcare professional during a mammogram that they may not always be able to check for cancer behind the implants.</p>
      <p>She told Lorraine: “I had them done 17 years ago… (if I could) go back, I would never have done it. I did not do enough research… really do study the whole procedure. It is not how it seems to be.”</p>
      <p>Remarking on how she feels now, she added: “I do feel more like myself. I’m still getting used to it – all the clothes are a little bit different now.</p>
      <p>“It was a DD, now it’s an A/B, it’s quite a difference in bust size. Before they were heavy, they were weighted, there was cancer in my family, I was concerned about that.”</p>
