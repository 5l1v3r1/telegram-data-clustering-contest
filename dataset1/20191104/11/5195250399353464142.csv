04 Nov 2019, 11:57 by Team GaadiWaadi
Renault was among the only three manufacturers that showed sales growth in October 2019 and is trying to capitalise on the momentum this month
Following the long-spell of falling sales in the auto industry, a handful of manufacturers registered growth in light of the festive season. Out of all the manufacturers in India, only three showed growth – Maruti Suzuki, Renault and Volkswagen. Meanwhile, experts believe that the growth might be temporary and the sales could fall once the festive season gets over.
In September, the French automaker, Renault was the only company which registered positive sales. And the same has continued in October. In the same breath, in an attempt to keep the sales numbers afloat, Renault has now introduced year-end offers for November on its cars.
The recently facelifted Kwid hatchback is now being offered by the company with a 4-year warranty in addition to Rs 2,000 corporate discount and Rs 10,000 worth of loyalty discounts for existing Renault Car users. The Lodgy MPV is now available with a flat cash discount of Rs 2 lakh in addition to Rs 5,000 discount for corporate users.
