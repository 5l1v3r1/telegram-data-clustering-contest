      <h1>From toast of town to toxic: Facebook CEO Zuckerberg on outs with Democrats</h1>
      <h2>Mark Zuckerberg's social network in Washington is shrinking</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:50:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">AP/PTI</a></address>
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg's social network in Washington is shrinking.</p>
      <p>Bipartisan hostility toward <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/facebook">Facebook </a>has been building for months. It's been fueled by a series of privacy scandals, Facebook's use by Russian operatives in the 2016 presidential campaign and accusations that the service crushes competitors.</p>
      <p>Now, with the 2020 elections approaching, Democrats especially are homing in on Facebook's conduct and its refusal to fact-check political ads and remove the false ones.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg's new strategy involves a personal blitz featuring private meetings in Washington with key lawmakers of both parties and President Donald Trump; small, off-the-record dinners at his California home with conservative journalists and opinion makers; and the occasional keystone public address or TV interview.</p>
