Valtteri Bottas has ""mixed feelings"" after winning the US Grand Prix
04 Nov 2019, 11:03 by Louis Shaw

Valtteri Bottas did all he could at the US Grand Prix to keep his World Championship hopes alive by winning the race but Lewis Hamilton claimed the title. The Finn is pleased that he won the race but is disappointed to know that the battle is essential over. 

“This weekend, winning it was the only thing I could do to try to maintain the title hopes or delay them,” Bottas said to Motorsport.com. 




“I did my part. Which feels good. But Lewis was still strong this weekend as he always is.





“Quite mixed feelings really, as an individual weekend it was strong. But on the other hand, being best of the rest doesn’t feel good.





“You always need to look at the positives as well. It’s my best season in F1 so far so that’s good.


“Looking at other positives, I’ve made huge gains in many areas in terms of race pace.


“But winning the race in this way… Lewis, I’m sure he really wanted to win the title by winning the race. I could stop that. So that feels good.”

Bottas needs to improve next season and will hope to take on board all the advice he can get as he looks to break down Hamilton in 2020.
