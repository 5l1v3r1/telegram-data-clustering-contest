      <p>With the western Nintendo Switch release of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition"><b>Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy - Deluxe Edition</b></a> just days away, we thought we'd get in the mood for some quizzing with these suitably tricky head-scratchers taken from the game.</p>
      <p>Nintendo has been sharing these pesky brain teasers over the last few weeks, building up to the game's 8th November release. If you're looking forward to picking up a copy for yourself, why not try these out for size as a little bit of practice? Good luck, though. <i>You're probably gonna need it.</i></p>
      <h3>Puzzle 1</h3>
      <p>Look closely at these weaselly sums – can you work out what the missing number is?</p>

      <h3>Puzzle 2</h3>
      <p>This island is submerged under the waves every day, at the time displayed on this mysterious monument. At what time does the island sink?</p>

      <h3>Puzzle 3</h3>
      <p>These clocks read 4:05, 2:18 and 3:05. One is 32 minutes fast, another is 28 minutes slow and the remaining one is broken. What time is it in this scene?</p>

      <h3>Puzzle 4</h3>
      <p>Look at the boards these characters are holding. If '1' has one, '2' has one, '3' has none and '4' has three, how many does '5' have?</p>
