The United Kingdom's opposition Labour Party said on Monday it would examine closely a proposal to ban private jets and consult with the industry about a phase-out date for the use of fossil-fuel private planes.
Andy McDonald, the opposition spokesman for the transport sector, said a report from the Common Wealth think-tank proposing a ban on private jets made a ""very convincing argument"".
""Why is the government enabling billionaires to trash the climate when it's the rest of us who will suffer the consequences?"" he said in a statement.
""In just a few years' time, it will be possible for these journeys to be made by electric aircraft - so long as [the] government puts in place the right incentives. Labour will examine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets.""
