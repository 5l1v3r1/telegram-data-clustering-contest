【Arran威士忌的斜槓思維3】大膽過桶實驗　造就驚豔的萬千風格
04 Nov 2019, 11:07 by 林亦君, 何宗昇
桶陳是威士忌的重要步驟，能形塑威士忌7成以上的風味。作為一個還算新的酒廠，Arran的最大特色便是勇於創新、挑戰過桶手法，果然造就讓飲者驚豔的多變風味。





首席調酒師James很敢於嘗試，大膽挑戰各種風味桶。



早期酒廠以顏色區隔風味桶，現在則改刷條碼管理。

雖然位在海島上，Arran酒廠卻不太強調碘味或海藻之類的海島風格，2003年就開始挑戰過桶陳年的手法。所謂的威士忌風味桶，是指將放在某種橡木桶中熟成的原酒，換到另一個更厚重或更有特色的橡木桶裡繼續熟成，藉此讓威士忌換上各種妝容，也增添層次感。
我們跟著首席調酒師James從蒸餾廠走到倉庫，放眼所見是滿坑滿谷的橡木桶，感覺裡頭全是寶藏，James笑說，早期他們在橡木桶上噴漆來區隔，後來越玩越大，用顏色已經無法區隔，現在都是刷條碼來管理，不過儲酒倉庫裡還是擺滿五顏六色的橡木桶，視覺感頗為震撼。


因為很重視過桶，首席調酒師James會親自確認每個橡木桶的狀況。



來到另一個儲酒倉庫，又是一堆尺寸各異的橡木桶，空氣中飄著淡淡酒香。

釀酒資歷豐富的James，除了常見的雪莉桶和波本桶，還取用蘋果白蘭地風味桶（Calvados Finish）、干邑白蘭地風味桶（Cognac Finish）、貴腐甜酒風味桶（Tokaji Aszu Finish）、Fino雪莉酒風味桶（Fino Sherry Finish）、特級香檳風味桶（Grand Cru Champagne Finish）、麝香葡萄酒桶（Moscatel Casks Finish）等超過40多種風味桶。
這些風味桶的特色強烈，每一種都限量上市，雖然頗具實驗性質，卻也造就Arran獨一無二的風格，從中也能得知Arran經典的水果氣息，略帶木質與奶油的風味是從何而來。


釀酒師的日常，就是按計畫抽取酒液，監控每個桶的釀造情形。



走進堆滿木桶的倉庫，便如走進寶藏堆裡。



年輕的釀酒師，細心地為每一桶酒做紀錄。

除了強調過桶，Arran的威士忌還有一個特色是非冷凝過濾，不用焦糖調色，略帶油脂的口感，叫人印象深刻。我們在遊客中心品飲基本款的10年，發現酒質的成熟度，遠超過實際年分，各式風味桶的深邃層次，更是豐富有趣，難怪這個酒廠雖然歷史不過20多年，在市場上卻一直頗受肯定。


各種有趣的風味桶，如義大利阿瑪諾尼紅酒桶（右，1,480元／瓶）和The Bothy四分之一桶的第四版單一麥芽威士忌原酒（左，1,600元／瓶），在台灣的「古華酒藏」都買得到。



在Arran的遊客中心，可以品嘗到各式各樣的經典風味威士忌。

[Arran whisky slash thinking 3] bold barrel experiment to create amazing style
04 Nov 2019, 11:07 by Lin Yijun, He Zongsheng
Bucket Chen is an important step in whisky and can shape more than 70% of whisky. As a fairly new winery, Arran's greatest feature is the courage to innovate and challenge the barrel technique, which makes the drinker's amazing flavor.





Chief bartender James dared to try and challenge the various flavor barrels.



Early wineries separated the flavor buckets by color, and now they change the bar code management.

Although located on the island, the Arran winery does not emphasize the island style of iodine or seaweed. In 2003, it began to challenge the old age of the barrel. The so-called whisky-flavored barrel refers to the original wine that is cooked in a certain kind of oak barrel, and then changed to another thicker or more distinctive oak barrel to continue to ripen, so that the whisky can be replaced with various makeup and layering. .
We followed the chief bartender James from the distillery to the warehouse, and looked at the oak barrels full of pits. I felt like it was all treasures. James laughed and said that in the early days they painted on oak barrels to separate them. Later, the more they played, the more they played. Large, color can not be separated, now is the bar code to manage, but the wine storage warehouse is still full of colorful oak barrels, the visual sense is quite shocking.


Because of the importance attached to the barrel, the chief bartender James will personally confirm the condition of each oak barrel.



Going to another wine storage warehouse, there are a bunch of oak barrels of different sizes, and the air is faintly scented.

James, rich in wine, in addition to the common Shirley barrels and bourbon barrels, also uses Calvados Finish, Cognac Finish, Tokaji Aszu Finish More than 40 flavor barrels, such as Fino Sherry Finish, Grand Cru Champagne Finish, and Moscatel Casks Finish.
These flavor barrels are highly featured, each of which is limited in size. Although experimental, it also creates Arran's unique style, from which Arran's classic fruity flavor, slightly woody and creamy flavors come from.


The winemaker's daily routine is to extract the liquor according to the plan and monitor the brewing situation of each barrel.



Walking into a warehouse full of wooden barrels is like walking into a treasure chest.



Young winemakers carefully record each barrel of wine.

In addition to emphasizing the barrel, Arran's whisky also features a non-condensing filter that does not require caramel toning and a slightly oily taste that is impressive. We have been drinking basic drinks for 10 years in the visitor center and found that the maturity of the wine is far more than the actual year. The deep level of all kinds of flavor barrels is rich and interesting. It is no wonder that this winery has a history of more than 20 years in the market. It has always been quite affirmed.


A variety of interesting flavor barrels, such as the Italian Amanoni wine barrel (right, 1,480 yuan / bottle) and The Bothy quarter barrel of the fourth version of the single malt whiskey original wine (left, 1,600 yuan / bottle), in Taiwan's ""Guhua Liquor"" is available.



At the Arran Visitor Centre, you can sample a wide range of classic flavours.
