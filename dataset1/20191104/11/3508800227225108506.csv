內容農場的最大禍害，不在於假新聞
04 Nov 2019, 11:14 by Kayue


我們想讓你知道的是內容農場利用人類的惰性吸引我們點擊轉發，而這些惰性——也許是看到誇張標題就轉發，又或不追尋消息來源——始終對追尋真相有害，因此內容農場轉載的資訊無論真假，我們都應與之割席。



早前我整理了一些內容農場網站（content farm）的資料，寫成〈不同網址的內容農場，背後疑由同一集團操作〉一文。這篇文章流傳之廣讓我有點意外（特別感謝求驗傳媒轉發），不過我見到有些人在分享文章時，似乎把「內容農場」跟「假新聞」畫上等號，而這其實誤解了內容農場的本質及禍害，特別想寫篇文章討論一下。
內容農場其實並不重視內容，它只著眼於流量，因為內容農場靠展示廣告換取收入，越多人看便賺得越多。而內容農場的文章之所以能夠廣傳，往往借助社交網絡、通訊軟件的威力，經常使用譁眾取寵甚至誇張失實的標題、縮圖，總之要吸引人點進去。
由於生產內容需要一定成本，內容農場得靠盜取文章來壓低成本，只要「加工」改個標題、配張縮圖，再透過一些Facebook專頁、群組傳播開去，便可以換取流量。與之相比，「創作」假新聞的成本可能更高。
比方說，近日我關注的內容農場主要從主流媒體抄襲一些跟示威抗議、香港警察有關的新聞，以及從「連登」LIHKG論壇抄走熱門帖文（這段時間的帖文主題同樣以跟示威者有關為主）。
如果是從一些主流媒體把新聞完整抄走，而且這些新聞本身沒有問題的話，那內容農場的文章就不算假新聞。然而分享內容農場的文章仍然有兩個問題︰一是影響原來網站的收入，二是協助失實訊息傳播。
新聞網站一般的收入來源是訂閱或廣告，如果本來是訂戶才能讀到的新聞，內容農場抄走後就會減低其他人訂閱的意欲；如果新聞本身免費但媒體靠廣告賺錢，廣告收入就從新聞媒體流到內容農場處。無論是哪個情況，媒體均蒙受損失，要是重視傳媒、記者的貢獻，就完全沒理由支持內容農場盜文。


其中一個涉嫌為發放內容農場連結而設的Facebook專頁「記你老母」最近一則帖文有超過4000次分享。

內容農場抄襲「真新聞」之外，亦會從連登抄走一些帖文，這些帖文可能是分析文章，也可能是傳聞、爆料。這些內容未必不可信，但並非新聞，而內容農場往往不會標示清楚，容易成為假消息流傳的溫床。即使可能有人在連登的討論串提出理據反駁，這些訊息也不會在內容農場上顯示。
Facebook透過演算法決定顯示哪些內容給用戶看，而用戶分享哪些網站連結對演算法的判斷亦有影響。假如你經常分享內容農場的連結，除了會令這些文章更易流傳外，也可能增加一些由內容農場營運的Facebook專頁、群組的帖文觸及率，讓更多人看到內容農場網站。
我認為最重要的一點，其實是我們應對自己協助傳播的訊息有高一點要求。從內容農場網頁看到沒有來源的消息，為何需要分享？現時也有些內容農場會提供消息出處，那就更應該點進連結，查看資訊來源，要分享的話就直接分享源頭，方便其他人查證。
假新聞固然有害，但即使面對「真新聞」，我們仍得保持思考，追問「到底為何可靠」．最終還是要查清楚資訊來源，再判斷是否可信。內容農場利用人類的惰性吸引我們點擊轉發，而這些惰性——也許是看到誇張標題就轉發，又或不追尋消息來源——始終對追尋真相有害，因此內容農場轉載的資訊無論真假，我們都應與之割席。

The biggest evil in the content farm is not the fake news.
04 Nov 2019, 11:14 by Kayue


What we want you to know is that content farms use human inertia to attract us to click-forward, and these inertia—perhaps to see exaggerated headings forwarded or not to pursue sources—are always harmful to the pursuit of truth, so the content farm reprints Whether it is true or false, we should be cut off.



Earlier, I compiled some information about the content farm and wrote it as a content farm with different URLs. The popularity of this article has made me a bit surprised (especially thanks to the media for forwarding), but I have seen some people seem to share the article ""content farm"" with ""fake news"", which is actually misunderstood. The nature and harm of the content farm, especially want to write an article to discuss.
Content farms don't really care about content. It only focuses on traffic, because content farms rely on display ads for income, and the more people look at them, the more they earn. The content farm articles can be widely spread, often relying on the power of social networks and communication software, often using singularity and even exaggerated inaccurate titles and thumbnails, in short, to attract people to go in.
Since the production content requires a certain cost, the content farm has to rely on stealing articles to reduce the cost. As long as the ""processing"" changes the title, the thumbnails are displayed, and then spread through some Facebook pages and groups, the traffic can be exchanged. In contrast, the cost of ""creating"" fake news may be higher.
For example, the content farms I paid attention to recently mainly copied some news from the mainstream media about demonstrations and protests, the Hong Kong police, and copied the popular posts from the ""Lian Deng"" LIHKG forum (the post topic during this time was also followed by demonstrations). Related to the main).
If the news is completely copied from some mainstream media, and the news itself has no problem, then the article on the content farm is not a fake news. However, articles sharing content farms still have two problems: one is to affect the income of the original website, and the other is to assist in the dissemination of misinformation.
The general source of income for news sites is subscriptions or advertisements. If the news is originally read by subscribers, the content farms will reduce the desire of other people to subscribe. If the news itself is free but the media makes money by advertising, the advertising revenue will be from the news. The media flows to the content farm. In any case, the media suffers losses. If we attach importance to the contribution of the media and journalists, there is absolutely no reason to support content farm piracy.


One of the most recent posts on the Facebook page ""Remember Your Mother"" for alleged distribution of content farms has more than 4,000 shares.

In addition to the plagiarism of the ""real news"", the content farm will also copy some posts from Lian Deng. These posts may be analysing articles, or may be rumors or breaking news. These contents are not necessarily untrustworthy, but they are not news, and content farms are often not clearly marked and can easily become a hotbed of fake news. Even if someone may argue in the discussion thread of Lian Deng, these messages will not be displayed on the content farm.
Facebook uses algorithms to determine what content to display to users, and which website links users share has an impact on the algorithm's judgment. If you often share the link to the content farm, in addition to making these articles more circulated, it is also possible to increase the reach of Facebook pages and group posts operated by the content farm, so that more people can see the content farm website.
I think the most important point is that we have a higher demand for the message that we help to spread. See the source farm page for news without a source, why do I need to share it? At present, there are also some content farms that will provide the source of the news. It is even more important to click on the link to view the information source. If you want to share it, you can directly share the source and facilitate others to verify it.
False news is harmful, but even in the face of ""true news,"" we still have to keep thinking and ask ""whether it is reliable."" In the end, it is still necessary to find out the source of information and then judge whether it is credible. Content farms use human inertia to attract us to click-to-forward, and these inertia—perhaps to see exaggerated headlines to be forwarded, or not to pursue sources—are always harmful to the pursuit of truth, so the information reproduced on the content farm is true or false, we They should be cut off.
