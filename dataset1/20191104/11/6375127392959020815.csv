MASAYA ang singer-actor and soon-to-be-pilot na si Ronnie Liang na magiging special guest niya ang Pop Star na si Sarah Geronimo sa kanyang concert this Friday, November 8 at 8 p.m. sa Music Museum na pinamagatang “Ronnie Liang: Love x Romance”.  Sobrang natuwa si Ronnie nang pumayag si Sarah na mag-guest sa kanyang sariling concert. Mas madalas kasi na siya ang guest ni Sarah sa kanyang shows.
Bukod sa solo spot number ni Sarah, nakatakda nilang awitin ang “Liwanag”  na first collaboration nilang dalawa.  Ito’y komposisyon ni Marlon Barrinuevo under Viva Records.
Bukod kay Sarah, special guests din ni Ronnie sa kanyang MM concert sina Ella Cruz at Janine Tenoso.
