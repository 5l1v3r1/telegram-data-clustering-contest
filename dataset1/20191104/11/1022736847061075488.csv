Jaji Mkuu wa Kenya aishtumu serikali kwa kukwamisha shughuli za Mahakama
04 Nov 2019, 11:25 by RFI

Jaji Mkuu wa Kenya David Maraga, amemshutumu rais Uhuru Kenyatta kwa kujaribu kudhibiti shughuli za Mahakama nchini humo.

Maraga ametoa kauli hii, baada ya serikali kuamua kuipunguzia bajeti ya fedha, suala ambalo amesema linatishia utendakazi wa muhimili huo muhimu, huku akihoji ni kwanini Mahakama inaingiliwa.
“Kila mtu asimamie jukumu lake, kwanini wanatupunguzia fedha ? Lengo ni kujaribu kuingilia majukumu yetu,” alisema Jaji Maraga.
Akionekana mwenye hasira wakati akizungumza na Wanahabari jijini Nairobi, Maraga amesema hatua ya Mahakama kutokuwa na fedha za kutosha, zimesababisha Majaji wa Mahakama ya rufaa, kushindwa kufanya kazi zao katika miji minne na hivyo kulazimika kusitisha vikao vyao.
“Iwapo bajeti haitaangaliwa upya, hatuna fedha za kununua mafuta kwa ajili ya nagari yanayowasafirisha Majaji, na inamaanisha kuwa hatutakuwa na kesi zitakazosikilizwa na Majaji wa Mahakama ya rufaa,” alisema.
“Mahakama maalum zinazoshughulikia kesi za ufisadi, zitasitisha shughuli zake,” aliongeza.
Jaji huyo ambaye pia ni rais wa Mahakama ya Juu nchini humo, ameapa kususia shughuli za kiserikali iwapo bajeti katika idara hiyo haitaangaliwa upya.
Wachambuzi wa siasa wanaona kuwa, idara ya Mahakama inapitia masaibu hayo baada ya rais Uhuru Kenyatta kuionya Mahakama mwaka 2017, wakati Mahakama ya Juu ilipofutilia mbali ushindi wake, baada ya Uchaguzi Mkuu.

Kenya's Chief Justice accuses the government of halting the Court's activities
04 Nov 2019, 11:25 by RFI

Kenyan Chief Justice David Maraga has accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of trying to control the country's judiciary.

Maraga made this statement, after the government decided to cut the budget, which he said threatens the functioning of the key issue, while questioning why the Court is being intervened.
“Everyone should take responsibility for their actions, why are they reducing our money? The goal is to try to interfere with our responsibilities, ”said Judge Maraga.
Appearing angry when speaking to the media in Nairobi, Maraga said the Court's lack of adequate funding, led to the Court's judges appealing, failing to perform their duties in four cities and thus forcing their sessions to end.
""If the budget is not reviewed, we do not have the money to buy fuel for the transportation of Judges, and it means that we will not have any cases heard by Appeal Judges,"" he said.
""Special courts dealing with corruption cases, will stop its activities,"" he added.
The judge, who is also the president of the country's Supreme Court, has vowed to suspend government operations if the budget in the department is not reviewed.
Political analysts note that the judicial department is reviewing the case after President Uhuru Kenyatta warned the Court in 2017, when the Supreme Court canceled his victory, following the General Election.
