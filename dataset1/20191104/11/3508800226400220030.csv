警察有何資格以「公眾知情權」、「專業」來批評記者抗議？
04 Nov 2019, 11:50 by 林彥邦


我們想讓你知道的是警方近月的「例行記者會」不斷修改規則，只為單方面發放對自己有利的資訊、逃避記者質問。警方高層多次宣稱尊重記者，但示威現場前線警員屢次無理、暴力對待記者，現時記者抗議，警方無資格用「公眾知情權」、「專業」來批評。



（編按︰今日警方例行記者會上，有6名記者分別戴上有「查警暴止警謊」6字的頭盔抗議，警方要求他們離開不果，取消記者會。）
前線行家今日的抗議行動，一如所料，警方搬出「公眾知情權」、「專業」來指手劃腳。
由警方來講公眾知情權和專業，何其可笑。
自8月5日警方開始例行記者會以來，由警方主導的記者會，已經離公眾知情權愈來愈遠，由始至終，這都不過是警方期望單方面發布訊息管控輿論的一場騷。
先不說，這「例行」記者會根本不是「例行」，而是隨警方的喜好，隨時可以召開或取消，那何時對警方而言是有「需要」？警方有事要「譴責」示威者就是有「需要」，而即使之前一日的記者會還有多少問題有待質詢，警方都不會視為有「需要」。這本來就是警方選擇性發放資訊的平台。
再者，長達45分鐘甚至1小時的開場白，充斥是警方單方面、選擇性發放的資訊，只聚焦於對警方有利的資料，例如「暴徒」如何破壞、打人、襲擊，網上哪些「謠言」不實需要澄清，但對警方確鑿的犯錯隻字不提，連在現場播放的片段都經刻意刪剪切頭切尾，只顯示「暴徒」的行為，例如當日在機場有警員拔槍示警，就剪走事前警員突然單獨衝前拉倒一名女子的部份；又例如播放紐約時報有關荃灣警員開槍打中男生胸口的整合片段，在開槍後《紐約時報》質疑警員開槍決定等剪走。

而警方對發放資訊的操弄亦愈演愈烈︰由一開始記者集體追問質問，令警方無言以對，警方就著手「控制」，先是將記者會主持由政府新聞處的新聞主任，換成警察公共關係科的警員，明顯是無視新聞處的專業角色和功能，然後陸續更改記者會的「玩法」，包括不容許記者自由發問，改以點名的方式指定提問的機構，還製作「座位表」以便點名；之後開始限制每名記者提問的上限，再強制記者必須「一次過」發問三條，期間阻截一切追問質詢，只容許警方代表單方面逐條回答。
這些做法的結果是甚麼？就是一切對警方的質問，都變成警方想答便答，不想答可以輕輕帶過的走過場；所以我們持續聽到，一切對警方不利的事例，得到的回應都是「電光火石」、「現場混亂」、「同事當時判斷」、「使用適度武力」，這些可有可無的官式答覆，甚至拋出一句「目前手頭上無資料」，記者一旦試圖追問，就會被指「搞事」、「畀阿sir答下一條先」、「個場係我哋嘅」等等。
在這樣的操弄下，公眾還能從這並非例行的「例行記者會」，得到公道、全面的資訊嗎？公眾得到的，只會是單方面的宣傳和不全面的資訊，甚至赤裸裸的謊言。
高振邦警司，作為這個製造散播不全面資訊以至謊言的場合的刀手，你有何資格說公眾知情權？
更別說每名前線記者都經歷過，警員的無理辱罵、阻擋、驅趕甚至攻擊，以閃燈、封鎖線、胡椒噴霧甚至拘捕阻礙採訪無日無之層出不窮，一直收窄公眾知情權的警方指控試圖捍衛的記者；屢屢無視警例、法例，以蒙面、拒絕出示委任證不顯示編號來隱藏身份，以粗言惡行恐嚇市民記者，胡亂使用武力的警隊，指控要求停止濫暴散播謊言的記者不專業——知唔知，個醜字點寫？

What is the qualification of the police to criticize journalists for protesting with ""the public's right to know"" and ""professionalism""?
04 Nov 2019, 11:50 by Lin Yanbang


What we want you to know is that the police's ""regular press conference"" in recent months has continually revised the rules and only unilaterally distributed information that is beneficial to them and evaded reporters' questions. The police officials repeatedly claimed to respect journalists, but the frontline police officers on the scene of the demonstration repeatedly ignored the reporters. The reporters protested that the police were not qualified to use the ""public awareness"" and ""professional"" to criticize.



(Editor's note: At today's regular police press conference, six journalists wore helmets with the words ""Checking the police and slamming the police"" 6 words. The police asked them to leave and cancel the press conference.)
The protests of the frontline experts today, as expected, the police moved out of the ""public right to know"" and ""professional"" to gesticulate.
It is ridiculous for the police to know the public's right to know and the profession.
Since the police began a regular press conference on August 5, the police-led press conference has become farther and farther away from the public's right to know. From the beginning to the end, this is just a slogan that the police expect to unilaterally release information to control public opinion. .
Let me not say that this ""routine"" press conference is not ""routine"" at all, but it can be convened or cancelled at any time with the police's preference. When is there a ""need"" for the police? There is something ""necessary"" for the police to ""condemn"" the demonstrators. Even if there are still many questions to be questioned at the press conference on the previous day, the police will not consider it ""need"". This is originally a platform for the police to selectively distribute information.
Furthermore, the opening of 45 minutes or even an hour is full of unilateral and selective information from the police. It only focuses on information that is beneficial to the police, such as how the ""thugs"" destroy, beat, attack, and which online. ""Proverbs"" don't really need clarification, but they don't mention the police's conclusive mistakes. Even the clips that were broadcast on the scene have been deliberately cut and cut, only showing the behavior of ""thugs"". For example, there were police officers at the airport on the same day. When the gun showed the police, the police officer suddenly rushed forward to pull down a part of the woman. For example, the New York Times reported that the Tsuen Wan police officers shot the integrated part of the boy’s chest. After the shooting, the New York Times questioned the police. The staff shot and decided to cut off.

The police's manipulation of the dissemination of information has also intensified. From the beginning, the reporters collectively questioned the question and the police were speechless. The police proceeded to ""control"". First, the press conference was presided over by the press officer of the Information Office of the Government and replaced by police public relations. The officers of the Section obviously ignored the professional roles and functions of the Press Office and then changed the ""playing method"" of the press conference, including not allowing reporters to freely ask questions, changing the name of the organization to ask questions, and making a ""seat table"" so that After the name is changed, the upper limit of each reporter's question is limited. Then, the reporter must be forced to ""three times"" to ask three questions. During the period, all the questions are intercepted, and only the police representatives are allowed to answer one by one.
What are the results of these practices? It is all the questions of the police that have become the police's answer to the question. I don't want to answer the questions that I can take with me. So we continue to hear that all the cases that are unfavorable to the police are answered by ""Electric Light Flint"" and ""On-the-spot Confusion."" ""Colleagues judged at the time"" and ""Use moderate force"", these can be dispensable official reply, and even throw a sentence ""There is no information at hand."" Once the reporter tries to ask questions, he will be accused of ""making things"". ""Hey sir answers the first one"", ""the field is my generosity"" and so on.
Under such manipulation, can the public get fair and comprehensive information from this ""routine press conference"" which is not routine? What the public gets is only unilateral propaganda and incomplete information, even naked lies.
Gao Zhenbang Superintendent, as a knifeman who makes the occasion of disseminating incomplete information and even lies, what qualification do you have to say the public's right to know?
Not to mention that every frontline reporter has experienced the police officers’ unreasonable insults, blocking, expelling and even attacking. The flashing lights, the blockade line, the pepper spray and even the arrests have hindered the interviews from endless, and the police have been narrowing the public’s right to know. Allegedly trying to defend the journalists; repeatedly ignoring the police, the law, masking, refusing to show the warrants, not showing the number to hide their identity, insulting the public to swear by the police, indiscriminate use of the police force, accused of demanding the cessation of lie The reporter is not professional - knowing what you know, an ugly word to write?
