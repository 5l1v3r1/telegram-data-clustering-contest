04 Nov 2019, 11:42 by Alfred P. Dalizon
PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco  Gamboa yesterday asked each member of the 195,000-strong police force to voluntarily donate a minimum of P10 for civilian-victims of a series of earthquakes that ravaged parts of Mindanao.
The official said that the voluntary donation will be sent to help victims of the earthquake in Regions 10, 11 and 12.
He said the PNP national headquarters will be taking care of policemen who were also affected by the quakes.
Gamboa required all financial institutions servicing the PNP to offer “soft loans” or “zero-interest loans” to the policemen-victims.   
The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) yesterday appealed for more support for thousands of families affected by the earthquakes.
