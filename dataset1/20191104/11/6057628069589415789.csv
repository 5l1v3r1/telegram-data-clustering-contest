The coach has won 45 of his 65 games in charge of the club, but their defeat on Saturday was the worst in his 10 years in Bundesliga history.
The team is fourth in the table, with the red team Borussia Monchengladbach four points clear.
Former assistant coach Hansi Flick is ready to take over from Kovac and will take charge of Wednesday's Champions League match against Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund next Saturday. .
