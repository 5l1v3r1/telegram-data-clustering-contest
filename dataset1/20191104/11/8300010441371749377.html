      <p>NEW YORK -- McDonald's Corporation says its chief executive officer has left the company after violating company policy by engaging in a consensual relationship with an employee.<br/><br/>The fast food giant announced former CEO Steve Easterbrook's departure Sunday, saying he demonstrated poor judgment. McDonald's forbids managers from having romantic relationships with direct or indirect reports.<br/><br/>In an email to employees, Easterbrook acknowledged he had a relationship with an employee and said it was a mistake. He said given the values of the company he agreed with the board that it's time to move on.<br/><br/>The board of directors named Chris Kempczinski as its new president and CEO. Kempczinski recently served as president of McDonald's USA.<br/><br/>Kempczinski thanked Easterbrook for his contributions and described him as a patient and helpful mentor.</p>
