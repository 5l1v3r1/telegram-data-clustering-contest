Strictly Come Dancing star Saffron Barker has explained why she wasn't wearing a poppy on this weekend's show after a backlash from viewers.
Eagle-eyed fans of the BBC One show were left outraged when they spotted the YouTube star didn't have a commemorative pin on her costume during her appearance on Saturday night.
Many tweeted Saffron, 19, to ask why she didn't have a poppy on - and she revealed BBC bosses banned her from wearing one because of the lift in her routine with AJ Pritchard.
One viewer wrote: ""Someone’s going to have to help me... have the BBC allowed saffron and AJ to get away with NOT WEARING POPPIES??!!
""Not that I’m offended it’s just very out of character for the BBC.""
Saffron then replied: ""We weren’t allowed to when we were dancing causeve [sic] our lift.""

The fan then added: ""Ah that makes sense!! I did notice that you were wearing one tonight / in rehearsals so was doubtful it was done out of disrespect!!""
After Saffron and AJ performed without their poppies on Saturday night's show, they were bombarded with messages from outraged viewers.
One wrote: ""How come Saffron and Aj are the only ones not wearing poppies on their outfits? It is because everyone has a choice?""

Another tweeted: ""Why aren't saffron or aj wearing poppies when everyone else is?""
However, many fans were thrilled that so many of the other Strictly stars were proudly displaying their poppies.
Another wrote: ""Not a huge Strictly fan but immensely pleased to see they all have their Poppies on.""
