日韓貿易戰可望「休兵」？文在寅跟安倍晉三見面會談
04 Nov 2019, 11:32 by 李修慧


我們想讓你知道的是自今年7月日韓貿易戰爆發以來，日本和南韓局勢緊張，4日在曼谷舉辦的東協峰會上，文在寅和安倍晉三終於面對面會談。未來是否續簽「韓日軍事情報機密保護協定」將成為衡量此次會談影響力的指標。



（中央社）日韓貿易戰延燒多時，正在泰國出席東協峰會的南韓總統文在寅今（4）日在曼谷會晤日本首相安倍晉三，兩國領導人一致認為韓日關係非常重要，需以對話解決懸而未決的問題。
南韓《聯合新聞通訊社》指出，韓日兩位領導人自去年9月在紐約舉行會談後，時隔逾一年再次面對面溝通，韓日關係能否由此迎來轉機備受各界關注。
這也是自今年7月日韓貿易戰爆發以來，文在寅和安倍晉三首次面對面會談。
南韓總統府青瓦台發言人高旼廷在新聞稿中稱，雙方今天在誠摯友好的氣氛中進行11分鐘的對話，並一致認為兩國關係非常重要，並認為需要透過對話解決兩國正面臨的問題。
青瓦台新聞稿稱，韓日兩位領導人都希望兩國外交部門透過官方管道開展的協商能夠早日取得實質性進展。文在寅提議可在必要時舉行高級別會談。安倍晉三表示，將盡一切可能尋求解決之道。
分析認為，在韓日關係降至冰點的情況下，兩國領導人這次會面反映出雙方在不應放任雙邊關係繼續惡化一事上存有共識。
報導指出，青瓦台一直致力於改善韓日關係，南韓國務總理李洛淵10月在東京會晤安倍晉三時，雙方也曾商定進一步加強兩國外交部門的溝通交流，盼早日解開僵局。
有觀察指出，從韓日領導人表現出的意志來看，不排除兩國今後可能透過「由上而下」方式改善關係的可能性，而是否續簽「韓日軍事情報機密保護協定」（GSOMIA）將成為衡量此次會談影響力的指標。
日本經濟產業省7月4日起實施對出口南韓的含氟聚醯亞胺（Fluorine Polyimide）、光阻劑（Resist）及蝕刻氣體（Etching Gas）等3項關鍵電子原料加強管制，引發南韓不滿。接著日韓兩國互相將對方從貿易優惠名單中剔除，接著南韓政府又決定不再續簽GSOMIA，兩國關係陷入建交以來最艱困局面。

Is Japan-Korea trade war expected to be ""disarmed""? Wen Zai met with Shinzo Abe
04 Nov 2019, 11:32 by Li Xiuhui


What we want you to know is that since the outbreak of the trade war between Japan and South Korea in July this year, the situation in Japan and South Korea has been tense. At the ASEAN summit held in Bangkok on the 4th, Wen Zai and Abe finally met face to face. Whether to renew the ""Korean-Japanese Military Intelligence Confidential Protection Agreement"" in the future will become an indicator to measure the influence of the talks.



(Central News Agency) Japan-Korea trade war has been burning for a long time, South Korean President Wen, who is attending the ASEAN Summit in Thailand, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Bangkok today (4). The leaders of the two countries agreed that South Korea-Japan relations are very important and need Solve unresolved issues with dialogue.
South Korea's ""Joint News Agency"" pointed out that since the two leaders of South Korea and Japan held talks in New York last September, they have once again face-to-face communication after more than a year. Whether the relationship between Korea and Japan can usher in a turnaround has attracted much attention.
This is also the first face-to-face meeting between Wen Zai and Abe since the outbreak of the trade war between Japan and South Korea in July this year.
In a press release, Gao Qingting, a spokesman for the South Korean presidential palace in Qingwatai, said that the two sides held an 11-minute dialogue today in a sincere and friendly atmosphere and agreed that the relationship between the two countries is very important and that the issues facing the two countries need to be resolved through dialogue.
The Qingwatai press release stated that both the Korean and Japanese leaders hope that the consultations between the diplomatic departments of the two countries through the official channels will achieve substantive progress at an early date. Wen Zai proposed to hold high-level talks when necessary. Abe said that he will do everything possible to find a solution.
The analysis believes that in the case of the fall of Korea-Japan relations to the freezing point, the meeting between the leaders of the two countries reflects the consensus that the two sides should not let the bilateral relations continue to deteriorate.
The report pointed out that Qingwatai has been working to improve relations between South Korea and Japan. When South Korean Prime Minister Lee Loon-woo met with Shinzo Abe in Tokyo in October, the two sides also agreed to further strengthen the communication between the two countries' diplomatic departments and hope to untie the deadlock at an early date.
It has been observed that from the will shown by the leaders of South Korea and Japan, it is not excluded whether the two countries may improve the relationship through the ""top-down"" approach in the future, and whether to renew the ""Korean-Japanese Military Intelligence Secret Protection Agreement"" (GSOMIA) It will be an indicator to measure the influence of the talks.
On July 4th, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan implemented controls on three key electronic materials, such as fluorine-containing polyfluorene (Fluorine Polyimide), photoresist (Resist) and etching gas (Etching Gas), which were exported to South Korea, causing dissatisfaction in South Korea. . Then Japan and South Korea removed each other from the list of trade preferences, and then the South Korean government decided not to renew GSOMIA. The relationship between the two countries fell into the most difficult situation since the establishment of diplomatic relations.
