Bastian Schweinsteiger has revealed that Jose Mourinho would often ask about Bayern Munich when he worked with him at Manchester United.
Niko Kovac was sacked as Bayern boss on Sunday, just one day after the Bundesliga giants were pummelled 5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt at the Commerzbank-Arena.
Bayern chiefs have already spoken to Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, but former Manchester United manager Mourinho is currently out of work and has also been linked with the job.
And according to Bayern Munich legend Schweinsteiger, who played under the Portuguese at Old Trafford, managing the German giants appears to appeal to Mourinho.

""I can imagine Mourinho in Germany,"" Schweinsteiger told Deutsche Welle.
""I remember he was always asking me about Bayern and the Bundesliga. During our away games, there was always Bundesliga on TV.
