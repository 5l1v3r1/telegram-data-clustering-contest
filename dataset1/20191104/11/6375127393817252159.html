      <h1>KZ ventures into acting, compared to the Superstar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:19:48+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/eugene-asis" target="_blank">Eugene Asis</a></address>
      <h3>KZ Tandingan, the internationally known Filipina singer, is now also an actress. She stars in her first movie, "The Art of Ligaw" under new film outfit, Coreminds.</h3>
      <p>In the movie, she plays a call center agent in Davao named Carisse, an ultra-guarded and feisty girl.<br/>KZ plays opposite Epy Quizon, playing a fortyish man named Jake who has been living in a world of emptiness despite spending years of flirting and one night stands.</p>
      <p>Experiencing mid-life crisis, Jake decides to find a girl and start a long term and meaningful relationship. He meets Carisse who is repulsed by his confidence. The attitude made him more strangely attracted to the younger woman.</p>
      <p>Since the main character lives in Davao, KZ is a like a fish thrown into the water as she has to deliver her lines in Visayan. "Natuwa ako kasi Bisaya talaga ako," she says.</p>
      <p>And her acting? "She underwent several workshops," says director Jourdan Sebastian. "And surprisingly, she was very good in her exercises."</p>
      <p>In fact, Epy, who's known as a no-nonsense actor, unabashedly compares KZ's brand of acting to Superstar Nora Aunor's. "I know, maba-bash ako, pero 'yun talaga ang nakita ko sa kanya."</p>
      <p>Nora, like KZ, started as a singer before being discovered as a great actress.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Epy veers away from his usual serious characters like Apolinario Mabini in "Heneral Luna" and "Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral" as he plays the flirty, funny, fresh Jake in the movie. Â </p>
      <p>For the movie, KZ wrote and performed two songs, Quicksand and Walanghiyang Pag-ibig.</p>
      <p>"The Art of Ligaw" will be preemed tonight at Trinoma Cinema 7.</p>
