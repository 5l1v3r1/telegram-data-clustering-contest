      <p>A new <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> documentary has revealed the reason why the singer shaved her head during her infamous breakdown in 2007.</p>
      <p>Titled <i>Britney Spears: Breaking Point</i>, the Channel 5 documentary features several people from the singer’s life, including tattoo artist Emily Wynne-Hughes, who saw Spears moments after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers.</p>
      <p>“[There was] an insane roaring sound outside,” Wynn-Hughed told interviewers about the moment, which occurred the evening after Spears left rehab in Tarzana, Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t sure what was happening, if there was a riot outside, and then the flashes came. The door opened slowly and a hooded figure walked in the door.’ </p>
      <p>She continued: “I noticed [Britney’s] hair was gone. I remember asking her, ‘Why did you shave your head?’ And her answer was a bit weird. It was, you know, ‘I just don’t want anybody touching my head. I don’t want anyone touching my hair. I’m sick of people touching my hair’.”</p>
      <p>The same documentary claims that Spears’s bodyguards accepted bribes to give members of the media access to the singer. </p>
      <p>Hairdresser Esther Tognozzi, who was present in the salon when Spears shaved her head, said:  ‘She had two bodyguards, supposedly keeping an eye out to make sure the paparazzi were not getting any pictures and one of them kept opening the blinds.</p>
