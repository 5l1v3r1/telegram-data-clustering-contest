      <h1>Bastian Schweinsteiger drops hint over Jose Mourinho's next job in management</h1>
      <h2>Niko Kovac was sacked as Bayern Munich manager on Sunday and the German giants are in need of a new boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:08:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Bastian Schweinsteiger has revealed that Jose Mourinho would often ask about Bayern Munich when he worked with him at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United.</a></p>
      <p>Niko Kovac was sacked as Bayern boss on Sunday, just one day after the Bundesliga giants were pummelled 5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt at the Commerzbank-Arena.</p>
      <p>Bayern chiefs have already spoken to Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, but former Manchester United manager Mourinho is currently out of work and has also been linked with the job.</p>
      <p>And according to Bayern Munich legend Schweinsteiger, who played under the Portuguese at Old Trafford, managing the German giants appears to appeal to Mourinho.</p>

      <p>"He really knew every single player, even from the smaller teams. He was also learning German."</p>
      <p>Mourinho has also been linked with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> job in recent weeks, as pressure continues to mount on Unai Emery.</p>
