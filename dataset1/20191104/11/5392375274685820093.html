      <p>At the moment the fingerprint sensors under the screen have a general problem which is the unlock area. Usually, the area is very small and you must place your finger at the exact spot to unlock the device. A couple of millimeters in any direction will make you have to replace your finger. Today, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has indicated that this experience will change with the Mi Note 10.</p>
      <p>This device includes an ultra-thin optical fingerprint sensor, which according to the company, is the first in the world to be marketed. It is faster, occupies less space and has a wider unlocking surface.

      <p>According to Xiaomi, this new fingerprint sensor is so fast that you only need a touch on the screen to unlock it. In other devices, the most normal thing is to leave your finger on for a few milliseconds until it is unlocked.</p>
      <p>It seems that this Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro will not only be a great device in terms of battery or camera, it will also improve the user experience when unlocking the device. We will see if this new sensor sets a trend in the market.</p>
