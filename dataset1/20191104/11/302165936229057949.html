      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 4 — DRB-Hicom Bhd has proposed an Islamic medium terms notes (Sukuk Wakalah) programme of up to RM3.5 billion in nominal value under the Shariah principle of Wakalah Bi Al-Istithmar with the tenure of up to 30 years.</p>
      <p>In a filing to Bursa Malaysia today, the group said the programme had been assigned a preliminary rating of A+IS with a positive outlook by Malaysian Rating Corporation Bhd.</p>
      <p>“The outlook revision to positive considered the group’s improved consolidated credit profile through streamlining businesses by divesting investments and non-core assets and in improving operating margins and strengthening liquidity position,” it said.</p>
      <p>DRB-Hicom noted that proceeds raised from the Sukuk Wakalah programme would be utilised to refinance the group’s existing financing or borrowings, the company’s capital expenditure and working capital requirements and/or investments, as well as general corporate purposes, and to pay all fees and expenses in connection with the programme.</p>
      <p>The group was embarking on this financing exercise to take advantage of the current conducive interest rate environment to raise medium- to long-term financing, it said.</p>
      <p>Maybank Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd are the joint principal advisers, joint lead arrangers and joint lead managers for the Sukuk Wakalah programme. — Bernama</p>
