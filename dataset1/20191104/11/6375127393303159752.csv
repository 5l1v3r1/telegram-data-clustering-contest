PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco  Gamboa yesterday ordered Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Police Regional Office director Brig. Gen. Marni Marcos Jr. to ensure the dismissal from the police force of three BARMM personnel arrested in an anti-narcotics operation in Parang, Maguindanao on Wednesday last week.
“I have instructed the regional director of BARMM, PBGen.  Marni Marcos, to initiate Summary Dismissal Proceedings within15-days against three PNP personnel of Marantao Municipal Police Station, namely, Police Executive Master Sergeant Monjel Nassal Aradais, Police Staff Sgt. Fahmi Bangon Como and Patrolman Sandiali Magundacan Manalao, who were arrested by PDEA and PNP agents in a drug buy-bust in Parang, Maguindanao last October 30, which yielded 50 grams of suspected shabu,” the PNP-OIC said.
The three’s immediate superior, Capt. Sainodin Benasing, the chief of the Marantao Municipal Police Station, has been ordered relieved of his post by Marcos  to undergo investigation for his failure to fully supervise his men.
“I would like to emphasize that the PNP internal cleansing program that we are implementing, will be swift, decisive and uncompromising, especially against personnel involved in illegal drugs,” Gamboa said.
Security forces on Wednesday last week arrested the three rogue policemen in a buy-bust operation in Parang, Maguindanao.
Seized were some 50 grams of shabu worth P340,000.
