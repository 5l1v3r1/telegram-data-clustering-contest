      <p><b>BEIRUT: </b>Thousands of Lebanese protested Sunday to keep up a nationwide street movement that has brought down the government, hours after a mass rally to support the embattled president.</p>
      <p>Unprecedented cross-sectarian demonstrations have gripped Lebanon since October 17, demanding a complete overhaul of a political system deemed inefficient and corrupt.</p>
      <p>On Sunday evening, thousands of protesters streamed into the main square carrying lebanese flags and a flurry of inventive slogans on cardboard, an <i>AFP</i> correspondent said.</p>

      <p>“Revolution,” they cried to the rhythm of electronic beats in Martyrs’ Square.</p>
      <p>“All of them means all of them,” they chanted, calling for political leaders from all sectarian stripes to step down.</p>
      <p>Abir Murad, 37, had come specially from the northern city of Tripoli to take part.</p>
      <p>“We are all united against the leaders… who haven’t changed anything in this country,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We came to say that change is now in the hands of the people.”</p>
      <p>Draped in white sheets, three demonstrators staged a mock execution of the grievances that pushed them down into the street.</p>
      <p>Nooses around their limp necks, they bore signs referring to corruption, sectarianism, and the 1975-1990 civil war.</p>
      <p>Protesters in the capital shouted in support of Shiite-majority areas such as Tyre, strongholds of the powerful Hezbollah movement, which has urged its backers not to protest.</p>
      <p>“Tyre, Tyre, Tyre. We’re rising up for you,” they chanted.</p>
      <p>Despite Hezbollah’s warnings, protests were also staged in the southern city itself, the National News Agency and television showed.</p>
      <p>People also took to the street in Sunni-majority Sidon and the northern city of Tripoli.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators’ roadblocks were lifted and banks re-opened after the government stepped down on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Protesters have however vowed to keep up the street movement until all their demands are met, including that a new government include independent technocrats.</p>
      <p>But a female protester in Tripoli, who gave her name as Najwa, said it was still very unclear if the new cabinet lineup would actually be different.</p>
      <p>“There’s no transparency,” she said. “The possible scenarios we’re hearing about through rumours are not very encouraging.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the capital, hundreds of men and women took part in a feminist march from the national museum towards the main square.</p>
      <p>“Our revolution is feminist,” read a banner carried by marchers.</p>
      <p>Protesters have called for an end to President Michel Aoun’s tenure, as well as a drastic change to a political system dominated by the same figures and families since the end of the civil war.</p>
      <p>Early afternoon, the president addressed Lebanese in a televised speech as thousands of his supporters thronged the road outside his presidential palace.</p>
      <p>“I call on you all to unite,” the 84-year-old Maronite Christian president said from his palace in the town of Baabda outside Beirut.</p>
      <p>He urged Lebanese to rally behind a roadmap to tackle corruption, redress the economy, and put together a civil government.</p>
      <p>“It won’t be easy, and we want your efforts,” he said.</p>
      <p>A proposed tax on calls via free phone applications such as WhatsApp triggered protests last month.</p>
      <p>But they soon morphed into a huge nationwide movement, denouncing a raft of woes including a lack of basic services, a failing economy, and corruption.</p>
      <p>Aoun’s supporters said they backed the overall demands of anti-graft protesters, but insisted the president was the only man able to bring about reforms.</p>
      <p>“General Aoun is a reformist and sincere man — not corrupt nor a thief,” said one supporter who gave her name as Diana.</p>
      <p>“He’s trying to fight against graft,” she said.</p>
      <p>Along with its allies including Hezbollah, Aoun’s political party holds the majority in parliament.</p>
      <p>It is headed by his son-in-law and outgoing foreign minister Gibran Bassil, who has emerged as one of the most reviled figures in the protests.</p>

      <p>More than 25 per cent of Lebanese citizens live in poverty, the World Bank says.</p>
      <p>The country’s economic growth has stalled in recent years in the wake of repeated political crises, compounded by an eight-year civil war in neighbouring Syria.</p>
      <p>At its height last month, the protest movement drew in hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
