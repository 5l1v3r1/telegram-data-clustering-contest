      <p>The affiliate of ISIS in Somalia pledged on Sunday allegiance to the organization’s new leader following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.<br/><br/>Somalia’s Province posted pictures on Telegram of around a dozen fighters standing among trees, with a caption saying they were pledging allegiance to Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi.<br/><br/>Quraishi was named as the organization’s leader on Thursday in an audio message that also confirmed Baghdadi’s death and vowed revenge against the United States. <br/><br/>US special forces killed Baghdadi in a raid in northwest Syria last month.<br/><br/>His death is likely to cause ISIS to splinter, leaving whoever emerges as its new leader with the task of pulling the group back together as a fighting force, according to analysts.<br/><br/>ISIS has resorted to guerrilla attacks since losing its last significant piece of territory in Syria in March.<br/><br/>Since Baghdadi’s death, it has posted dozens of claims of responsibility for attacks in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere.</p>
