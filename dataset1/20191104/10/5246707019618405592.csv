UK Charts: Luigi's Mansion 3 Just Had The Best Opening Week Of Any Switch Game In 2019
But couldn't take number one
04 Nov 2019, 10:00 by Ryan Craddock



UK chart data is now in for the week ending 2nd November, revealing that Luigi's Mansion 3 has had a very impressive debut indeed.
The spooktacular game has become the fastest-selling physical Switch game of 2019, ahead of the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Super Mario Maker 2, and its opening sales are 140% higher than its 3DS predecessor without even including digital. Of course, it helps that Nintendo released the game on a Thursday for Halloween - giving it a slightly longer opening weekend than other titles have received.
It couldn't quite get number one this week, though, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare keeping that honour all for itself. It's interesting to note that Ring Fit Adventure is still selling strongly, staying in seventh place for another week in which 12 Nintendo Switch exclusives can be found in the top 40.
