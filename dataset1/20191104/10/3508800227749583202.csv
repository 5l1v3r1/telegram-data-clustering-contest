我們想讓你知道的是如果不是走投無路，又有誰願意拿命去賭。

就算付錢給你，你也許還不願意踏進冷凍貨櫃關上15小時，更何況是拿出身家財產換一個貨櫃座位？
如果不是走投無路，又有誰願意拿命去賭。
戰亂、極度貧窮、人權低落與政治迫害是許多走上偷渡道路的底層移民說不出的無奈，能尋求正規管道合法移民的自然多屬於社會階層裡資源豐富的頂尖份子，而身處底層，求活，往往只能拿出僅剩的性命賭上一把。
自由與希望的代價從來都不小，我只是生而有幸在平和的時代，台灣情勢雖危險但仍是獨立的個體，政府總有缺失但起碼底線還在，世事本來就不完美，所以才需要一同努力，遠離極端不公義的社會樣貌。
願台灣還有溫暖與道義存活。

What we want you to know is if there is no way to go, and who is willing to take the gamble.

Even if you pay for it, you may not be willing to step into the frozen container for 15 hours, let alone take out the property for a container seat?
If there is no way to go, who is willing to take the gamble.
War, extreme poverty, low human rights and political persecution are the helplessness of many immigrants who have embarked on the road of smuggling. They can seek formal channels. The legal immigrants naturally belong to the top resources of the social stratum, and they are at the bottom. Live, often only take out the only remaining life gambling.
The price of freedom and hope has never been small. I was born with the privilege of being in a peaceful era. Although the situation in Taiwan is dangerous but still an independent individual, the government is always missing but at least the bottom line is still there. The world is not perfect, so it is necessary. Work together to stay away from the social appearance of extreme injustice.
May Taiwan still have warmth and morality to survive.
