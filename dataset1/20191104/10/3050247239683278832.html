      <h1>Nasdaq-Powered Security Token Exchange Shutters to Pursue Merger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:15:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Just nine months after its launch, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/nasdaq">Nasdaq</a>-<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/first-crypto-exchange-using-nasdaqs-tech-announces-launch-excluding-us-customers">powered</a> digital trading platform DX.Exchange is temporarily shutting down as it pursues a merger or outright sale.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/estonia">Estonia-based</a> platform made the <a href="https://blog.dx.exchange/2019/11/03/6595/">announcement</a> on Nov. 3, informing users that “the costs of providing the required level of security, support and technology is not economically feasible on our own.”</p>
      <h3>Users asked to promptly submit withdrawal requests</h3>
      <p>As reported, DX.Exchange — which uses Nasdaq’s matching engine and market surveillance technology — was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-powered-eu-exchange-reveals-crypto-trading-pairs-tokenized-stocks">launched</a> in Jan. 2019, with support for various fiat and cryptocurrency trading pairs as well as tokenized stocks.</p>
      <p>In its statement yesterday, the exchange told users that with immediate effect, all deposits and trading were being suspended, with all open orders to be cancelled by 12:00 GMT that same day.</p>
      <p>While pledging to release further information in due course, DX.Exchange revealed that:</p>
      <blockquote>“The board [of directors] believes this is the best opportunity for DX.Exchange to achieve success for its shareholders and compete in this challenging market. In the event a merger or sell is not completed in a timely matter then the exchange may not resume operations and take appropriate action.’</blockquote>
      <p>In a bid to reassure clients faced with the abrupt move, the platform claimed that all user funds were safe and would need to be returned to allow for a merger or acquisition to go ahead.</p>
      <p>For users to claim their withdrawals, the exchange outlined a Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure — involving submission of government ID, a selfie, wallet address and email details — for them to follow “as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Users’ withdrawal requests must be submitted by Nov. 15, failing which the exchange has warned their withdrawal process could be disrupted.</p>
      <p>The platform has thanked the public for its “support and understanding in these difficult times” and says it will notify users of the merger/acquisition progress.</p>
      <h3>DX.Exchange’s brief history</h3>
      <p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-powered-eu-exchange-reveals-crypto-trading-pairs-tokenized-stocks">reported</a>, DX.Exchange had offered trading of tokenized stocks in major tech firms that included <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/amazon">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/baidu">Baidu</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/apple">Apple</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/google">Google</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/intel">Intel</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/netflix">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/nvidia">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tesla">Tesla</a>.</p>
      <p>This March, the exchange had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-powered-eu-digital-exchange-dx-launches-security-token-trading">claimed</a> an alleged industry first with its launch of security token trading, security token offering (STO) listings and tokenized <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-powered-eu-digital-exchange-dx-adds-tokenized-etfs">exchange-traded</a> funds. </p>
      <p>These products required investors to undergo an additional layer of KYC checks, in compliance with the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/eu">European Union</a> Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II. </p>
      <p>Nasdaq has also previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-partners-with-vaneck-to-release-regulated-surveilled-digital-assets-products">partnered</a> with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">United States-based</a> investment firm VanEck to jointly launch a series of “regulated and surveilled” digital asset products.</p>
