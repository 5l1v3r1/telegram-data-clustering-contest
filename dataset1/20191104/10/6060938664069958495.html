      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajay-Piramal">Ajay Piramal</a> said he plans to resign as chairman of Shriram Capital Ltd, the Indian non-bank finance company backed by South Africa’s Sanlam Group, as he works to sell his stake in Shriram’s parent group.</p>
      <p>“I will step down in due course as I do not have much role in Shriram Capital," Piramal said in a recent interview in Mumbai. He declined to share details.</p>
      <p>Piramal, who was named chairman of unlisted Shriram Capital in 2014, is exiting the Chennai-based group after failing to consolidate his holdings into a non-banking financial behemoth amid a cash crunch in India’s financial system. He is now planning two funds to invest in embattled realty projects and lend to retail borrowers after announcing a $770 million capital raise.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shriram-Group">Shriram Group</a> is urging Piramal to continue as chairman even if he doesn’t hold any shares, founder R Thyagarajan said by phone.</p>
      <p>The billionaire’s pharmaceuticals-to-real estate group <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Piramal-Enterprises">Piramal Enterprises</a> Ltd sold its 10% stake in truck financier Shriram Transport Finance Co in June and has started the process to sell its 20% in Shriram Capital.</p>
