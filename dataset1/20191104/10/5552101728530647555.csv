一上交通工具看見字就暈車　貝童彤生完小孩就好了

衛視中文台《請問你是哪裡人》日前邀請黃小柔、貝童彤、詹乃蓁及黃馨儀上節目談「生完小孩什麼都會了」的議題。貝童彤生小孩前是上車一看到字就會暈車的那種，生了小孩後因為要帶小孩回高雄娘家，整個車程快5個小時，為了陪小孩玩，她後來練就可以連續陪小孩玩兩個小時的技能。
貝童彤就說到自己生小孩前是個超級會暈車的人，還只能坐前座不能坐後座，而且一上任何交通工具就不能看任何有字的東西，或是聚焦在同一個點上面，只能看著窗外的風景不然一定暈車。
但生了小孩後，因為貝童彤娘家在高雄，只要帶寶寶會娘家，至少都要開上4、5個小時的車，小孩也不可能整路睡，只要小孩一醒來，貝童彤就要陪她玩，這時候她的視線就會聚焦在小孩身上。貝童彤笑說一開始的時候還真的會暈，常常要陪小孩玩一下，再撇頭轉看窗外風景，不然真的會讓她很想吐，到現在孩子已經10個月大，貝童彤也訓練出可以陪小孩連玩兩個小時但不暈車的媽媽技能，所以她極力推薦會暈車的女性朋友們，生個孩子就能改善，讓全場笑翻。
黃小柔則說生小孩前自己是屬於兩隻手連寶特瓶蓋都打不開的人，去測驗握力醫生也說黃小柔就是天生好命東西都要別人提。黃小柔說但生了小孩後，不是提而已還得抱。像上次帶小孩去動物園玩，孩子一說媽媽抱，黃小柔趕緊抱起來，但小孩一被抱就不想下來，讓她只能抱著13公斤的小孩從熊貓館走到野生動物區，抱了一個多小時，走到她都覺得快往生了，才後悔應該在入園時就花個50元租嬰兒車，就不會抱小孩抱到手快斷掉。

As soon as I saw the word on the vehicle, I got a motion sickness.

Satellite TV Chinese ""Where are you from?"" recently invited Huang Xiaorou, Bei Tongyu, Zhan Naiqi and Huang Xinyi to talk about the topic ""What will happen to a child?"" Before the birth of a child, Bei Tong was the kind of motion sickness when she saw the word. After giving birth to a child, she had to take the child back to Kaohsiung’s family. The whole journey was 5 hours. In order to accompany the child, she can continue to accompany the child. Play for two hours of skill.
Bei Tongyu said that before he gave birth to a child, he was a super-stunned person. He could only sit in the front seat and could not sit in the back seat, and he could not see anything with words on any vehicle, or focus on the same point. Can only look at the scenery outside the window, otherwise it must be motion sickness.
But after giving birth to a child, because Bei Tong’s family is in Kaohsiung, as long as she takes her baby to her family, she must drive at least 4 or 5 hours. The child can’t sleep all the way. As long as the child wakes up, Bei Tongyu She is going to play with her, and her eyes will be focused on the child. Bei Tongxiao said that at the beginning, it was really dizzy. I often had to play with the children. Then I turned to look at the scenery outside the window. Otherwise, she would really want to vomit. Now the child is 10 months old. Nursery rhymes also trained mothers who can play with children for two hours but don't get motion sickness, so she highly recommended female friends who can get motion sickness, and a child can improve and let the audience laugh.
Huang Xiaorou said that before he gave birth to a child, he belonged to two people who couldn't open the bottle. He went to the test. The doctor also said that Huang Xiaorou is a natural and good thing to be mentioned. Huang Xiaorou said that after giving birth to a child, it was not a mention but a hug. Like the last time I took the child to the zoo to play, the child said that the mother hugged, Huang Xiaorou hugged and hugged, but the child didn't want to go down when she was hugged, so she could only walk from the panda hall to the wild animal area with her 13 kg child. More than an hour, when she came to her, she felt that she was going to die, and she regretted that she should spend 50 yuan to rent a baby stroller when she entered the park, so she wouldn’t hold her hand and break it.
